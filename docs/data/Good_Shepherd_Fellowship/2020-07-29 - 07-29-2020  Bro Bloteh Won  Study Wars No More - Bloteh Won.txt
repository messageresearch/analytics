have a few prayer requests to bring to you tonight amen praise the lord what a confidence we have when we can approach the throne of god with with such a feeling in our heart and we know it's not by works it's not something we are working ourself into it's something that we are claiming by grace amen we are claiming it by faith praise the lord it's a wonderful thing amen tonight we have a few prayer burden we want to share with you tonight and uh left my phone but in the office that's fine i got a prayer request from one of the young brothers over there in the in moher daniel he's not feeling well he wanted us to remember him in prayer tonight and i have another friend of the years uh uh from zimbabwe also that is schooling there uh he has uh uh kind of a slip in my mind now this there's a kind of uh devil that was bothering him and he was in the hospital and they called that we should pray for him and so i'm hoping to hear back from them and and see if the law would give us an opportunity to visit there and pray for the young man so we want to remember that tonight uh and we also want to pray for uh those brothers in in china i got an update on them and we want to remember them in prayer that the law will will will remember them for all that they are doing for the kingdom of god praise the lord that god will remember them and according to the update i mean they are able to talk with their families which is a good thing but uh they have stay in praising and for this very gospel that we have the privilege to sit in church tonight and sing have the liberty to know that right after service tonight you go back to your house you will have the comfort of your bed there are some that are in praising tonight praise the lord for this very same word of god this very same message of the hour so you have to take that to heart and don't take it for granted praise the lord amen there was a there's a brother that uh visited us here on on on on sunday uh our brother crazy came down from uh uh he came down from uh illinois he actually originally lived in uh i can sir but he drove from illinois through the night uh just to come down and have service with us i want for us to to remember him we we had a privilege to talk with him and after the service there they had some serious situation there that we need the grace of god to come on the scene for our brother and he have some health issue that is that is uh that is overtaking his mind in a sense word i mean he sometimes will say some things and not actually together so we want to want to pray for him i had a privilege to talk to his wife and also to his pastor to get to know what the situation is now but i will use that platform tonight since uh we're going to remember our brother in prayer i just saw the text message from another young man he has come true here a few couple of times he's down in waterloo young brother john some of you know him and the last time we stopped over in waterloo i tried to get a hold of him and i was not getting the hold of him i knew the young man was was in trouble trouble not as a sense of being in jail or with the police the greatest trouble you can be in is sin trouble praise the lord amen when sin is after you you know that was what god told king and he says make your way right or as sin will be after you that's what god told him sin is at your door you know it will be after you praise the lord the only place to have from sin is under the blood amen the only place to have from sin is on at the foot of the cross praise the lord if you leave that place sin is going to chase you amen and you know like brother branham said he says it will carry you far then you want to stay father you want to go it will keep you longer than you want to stay so i knew that a young man was in trouble because he will always pick up my phone calling and i'll call him several times later he will not pick my phone call and so i had a privilege to call him the other day i said well maybe if i use a different phone number he will know that his brother won and so that's exactly what i did and he picked it up and i stuck him to the gun and said young man what's wrong with you what are you refusing to pick up my phone you know but finally we were able to address the situation he needs our prayer and he needs our prayer so just like i said while we we we all approach the throne of grace tonight i want to encourage you i want to encourage each and every one of us most especially most especially our young people most especially our young people i want to i want to encourage you we have this grace we have this opportunity you know wednesday night sunday morning don't don't take it lightly you know don't take it like you know a place that you get so used to coming because uh one of the days you might not have this opportunity you know and uh if there are things that are bothering you there is a god in heaven james said in the scripture he says if our heart condemned us now we have confidence with god he said but even if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart so you don't you don't allow that condemnation to frustrate you you don't allow that condemnation to take you away from god that is greater than your heart god that is better than the condemnation you don't you don't allow that you know you don't allow that when you have trouble and and uh maybe you you allow things in your life you do things that you're not supposed to do run to the truth of mercy because you always find mercy there there is still blood there is still that blood that speak at better things we know that one of these days that blood will normally be on the throne so there is no amount of prayer you can pray at that time that would be heard but now that we say grace and mercy praise the lord so while we remember these few needs you know we want to pray for brother christ uh you know my heart really go out to the brother i mean he and his wife have six children and i mean he's away from his children and uh with everything that is going on and uh you know how sometimes you you get you get you get caught into a situation where you think that you can help the person you know and and after i had a little time to to step back a little bit and pray i thought i said well i think the right thing to do is to speak with his pastor and get to know what the situation is you know because if you don't go back to the root of the situation there is no way you can help this situation so let's pray for brother christ let's pray for brother christ and let's pray for brother john young brother john over there in waterloo these brothers need the grace of god and let's commit them in the hands of the lord uh let's pray for those two brothers over in china that are in praising let's commit them in the hands of the lord as well and praise the lord amen is there any other unspoken prayer requests you want to uh just lift it up to the lord by the up raising hands let's just uh praise the lord [Music] i see uh let's just commit a uh pray for brother's cat too he mentioned the problem of his his legs in the hands of the lord and we just want to remember our brother that the lord will just step right in there and be able to touch him he can calm the stone make us all to shine again i know the master i know the master of the way i know the makeup of the rain [Music] let jesus come this time make your soul to shine again i know the master let's just use this time each and every one of us while the musician will play softly let's speak to

[Music] yes [Music] can you imagine a desired experience when he went into the house of the lord the first time he will be able to break into a vision or the trance to see the kind of a reverence that the angels bring to god [Music] the first time he will be able to break into a trance and see the kind of a reverence the kind of a reverence that the angels bring to god in all that he knew as keeping the lord or righteousness or whatever he think he was doing right he said war is me woe is me for i'm undone oh you are [Music] the lord bless you thank you musicians you see that's the reason why god had to take the form of a man because even the angels that's the reason why it's a mystery because the way the angels know of god's holiness it had to be a mystery it has to come in a way of a man and come by the weight of a birthing and all of that and natural birth and all of that uh even the angels wouldn't have accepted that the god of heaven praise the lord god of heaven in his state of holiness to be associated with what the situation the word was in praise the lord and here we have this opportunity to come into his presence to approach him like uh paul said in the book of hebrew by a new living way you know we we have to come and approach him you know uh just just listening to brother brahm tonight he says god don't even he don't even look at us he don't even listen to us he's listening to the blood that's right amen he's listening to the blood that's the reason why if our prayers are not lined up with the word of god i mean they just hit the wall and dash to the floor it has to be lined up with the word because god listening to the blood you know he's listening to the blood i mean like james said how can you bring uh uh on pure water and pure water from the same fountain you know how will god listen to us i mean we tell lies with this tongue we i mean we tell things that we should not talk with this stone how will he listen to that it has to come through the blood it has to come through the blood he's listening to the blood amen are you glad tonight there's a blood that speak better things on our behalf praise the lord amen the lord bless you tonight and let you stand on our feet and my goodness my goodness me praise the lord my goodness me why am i why am i here that's not where i'm supposed to be let's let's read isaiah chapter 2 isaiah chapter 2 let's read isaiah chapter 2. and the word of the lord and and the word that isaiah the son of amos saw concerning judah and jerusalem and it shall come to pass in the last days it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountains of the lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains amen the mountains of the lost house shall be established in the top of the mountains when uh uh uh let me just read and make you to have your seat because i'll just keep you standing now in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it and many people shall come and say come here and let us go up to the mountains of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he shall teach us of his ways and we will walk in his steps in his path for out of zion shall go forth the lord and the word of the lord from jerusalem praise the lord and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat the assault into plot shares and their spears into pruning hawks nations shall not lift up swore against nation neither shall they learn war anymore o house of jacob come here and let us walk in the light of the lord amen father we ask your blessing upon your word tonight we want to use this lord as a as a talking father god in there and that you will be able to see our desire our weaknesses our needs oh god when you look at the bleeding world help us tonight father we really need your help we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed glory be to god amen praise the lord we have 25 minutes to preach tonight amen can we do it praise the lord our god is more than able amen we can do all things through christ who strengthen us praise the lord amen we just we just thank the lord and and uh i i want to take a little uh thought tonight actually i will be i'll be speaking on uh the mountain of the lost house that is established in the top of the mountains you know we've been speaking the mountains these few days amen praise the lord mean i'm i want to keep i want to keep our mind in there because there are a lot of attraction you know i was thinking about it the mountain of the lord house in the top of the mountain you know god gave noah an instruction to build those build the act you know exact measurement and everything you know and when noah did that it pleased the lord so well i mean he came down in his in his mercy and i mean he just blessed noah and and those animals in the act praise the lord you see following god's instruction exactly as god said give noah the the privilege to experience what it was with adam and eve amen because as long as the those animals came on a noah's anointing the the the presence of the holy ghost i mean the lion and the lamb the goat and all of that they could all fellowship i mean evil was taken away they went right into the ark can you can you imagine what it was for even noah's psalms says father i are you sure are you sure that liar not tricking us oh no son you can go and rob you can go and wrap it on the head and it's just not a one bit thing that got into the act the door is shut man the door is shut god had to keep evil out of that act because his sin will go down there noah bones will be the one that will that will come after the flood but you think about it now that act was the lost house it was the lord's house and where did the egg landed on top of the mountain the law house on top of the mountain the lord now the lost house on top of the mountain with peace in the ark the lion and the lamb lied together what is the picture that is in your mind a foretaste of the millennium a full taste of the one day rest and four taste of what adam had praise the lord so even if if if if no one just had a record if he just had a record if he just had a record of adam and and and and and e-belt and seth and and i mean and everything that happened in the eating in in the garden of eden if you just had a record just like you and myself had a record of how adam named those animals you know what and and and brother branham will bring us a drama and tell us you know uh uh he'll look at the the the the lion the cheetah and all of those animals and and he just rubbed them by the head and and this was when sin has not been introduced yet praise the lord so if i if noah just had a record that he read and to see that they have to use balls and and arrows and spears to be able to chase those animals down to hunt them and after they kill them they look like wow drop it whoa it's dead that's why they were doing it the animal is dead they have already killed it and they admire it oh it's beautiful but when they see a living one they run away and you always sting in his mind and says man i wonder what it was this is you know said because i i call into history uh enoch was the one that gave us the first first language there were records that was passed down you know passed down it was it was all it was all oral history so if god did not give moses a vision we will not have accuracy so what the account that moses wrote in genesis was by vision or s we will not have accuracy but yet noah thinking in his mind wow well maybe he saw the lion trying to jump on his prey and he said you are lying maybe that's why adam saw but no adam will call them and he will you pet them rub your head come on boy go ahead go and play but here is nowhere here after obeying the voice of god following god's instruction to build an act he's having the privilege of experiencing what adam experienced praise the lord those animals going into the act two by pairs they went into the ark noah his wife his sons and dear wives went into the act and the bible says god closed the door god shut the door and i believe that was the same way in eden god shut the door until genesis 3 amen praise the lord now so get the picture now this is the house of god the tabernacle of god the act of noah was the tabernacle of god because god the creator of heaven and earth had to be present in that act for all his creature to be at their best amen that's the only time we are at our best when god is present praise the lord we're the best in age best in attitude we are at our best when god is present praise the lord the house of the lord on top of the mountain the boat sailed went through the flood and everything and landed on top of the mountain praise the lord in 40 days and forty night the rain fell the tunnel rolled the boat went up and down and everything that was happening noah his sons the animals they would stay at their best water fellowship god sustained him god feared him he had talked because if the lion gets hungry you start eating animals so god sustained them i love that praise the lord amen i thought to to grab your attention with this tonight i want to i want to speak uh on a little taught here tonight and i'll continue if if the law is well on sunday and uh uh well down here were isaiah said uh verse 4 and they and he shall judge among the nation and shall rebuke many people and they shall shall beat their swords into plot shares and and their spears into pruning hawks because we were plant in the in in in the millennium so this is a millennium promise a man instead of using swallow to hunt people down they will use it to plant praise the lord and uh nations shall not live upswall against nation neither shall they learn war anymore pray to the lord so while just you know kind of for a little thought here steady wars no more amen that's our future that is the future that we must be living for amen a future where they will land wars no more they will study wars normal because right now in this in this in this uh uh time that we are living in that's why we are hearing all of this language of superpower they are studying walls they are studying you know men are starting making atomic bombs just to be able to have an edge over another nation praise the lord you know i was reading through uh uh [Music] isaiah chapter 1 and it speaks here in verse 2 year o heavens and give ears o earth for the lord have spoken i have i have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me their ox nowhere his owner their ass his master creep but israel does not know my people does not consider a sinful nation a people living with iniquity the sea of evildoers children that are corrupt they have forsaken the law they have provoked the holy one the holy one of israel unto anger they are gone away backward now i was thinking about this and and and just before i left the office there was there was a scripture that struck my mind i was not able to get to it but there in the in the book of isaiah somewhere in one of those prophets the bible was talking about jerusalem and and scripture said jerusalem one time was admired by all the nations around her when it went into captivity they got an evil name and everybody that look at the city cursed the city one time in the reign of solomon the time of david i mean when when when israel had kings that were gulf hearing jerusalem had a name now the reason why i was thinking on that scripture because i was bringing it home one time america had a name this was the nation that uh that two tribes in the country could not fight america the the the the the senate goes and talks about it they i mean they come to a resolution they send a a a word to the people they will send army down there to seize the the fight i mean they were just like a big brother told the world but we almost now having riot in every city we're having riot in every setting people possessed by evil spirit and now you know let me let me say this to you young people then that's the reason why i continue to encourage you don't fill your mind with the media you will get a wrong spirit on you because the reason there is that prophecy is what driving this world what god said will come to pass will come to pass nobody can stop it your ambitions and your desires cannot control god's word it's what driving us to the place that we are brother branham says rock and roll will prepare them for armageddon meaning that the music that they will be listening to all will just be violent music that is that's the thing that is putting all of these young people on the street is the music that they are listening to all those rap music evil spirits just like jerusalem one time it was admired i mean i i mean you you you we read about the queen of solomon i mean it was not only the queen of solomon there were queens and kings that was coming coming from around the world that time to hear the wisdom of solomon they wanted to get down there to jerusalem on the date of pentecost what was happening when those when those disciples came out they started speaking in tongues and and everybody the bible says everybody every nation under heaven was represented in jerusalem at that time people were sending their children to jerusalem to learn to learn the wisdom of of the jews just like how an american citizenship is it's a proud thing that's just how being in jerusalem even though at that time it was ruled or controlled by a roman empire that that is that is daniel prophecy but it still had his glory just like rome was was ruling jerusalem they were ruling other parts of the world but jerusalem was the place of attraction praise the lord amen learn from the story of of ruth now meaning her friend after their husband and dad they wanted to go back to jerusalem they wanted some kind of identity because there was just something about the place there was something about the place and the thing that was about the place it was because god identified himself with that city amen he identified himself with that city praise the lord but it came a time when the people forsook the word of god and they started learning the ways of all the nations around them they start trying their gods and and and and and all their craftousness and and start going in and and to divinations and getting themselves involved with with spirits that they don't even know about the glory of god departed the glory of god departed a few few weeks ago for one one of this night i was i was i was just meditating and reading uh i was reading one of my devotionals that i have on on charles pardon he said something very that thing struck me i mean it kept me up the whole night in his days he called him the preachers of preacher he said this he said the most holy man the most holy man the most righteous man he says when god lifts his grace from on you you will become the most sinful man he said if god lift his grace from you you will do things that you never believe you can do so it pays to seek the grace and mercy of god and not to get proud in our ways because when god lift his hands from on you and that's what happened to jerusalem that i mean the city was wasted we know when rihabram came the cedar was splitted 10 tribes to to to to to israel two tribes left with judah and because of david's sake why because that city jerusalem that very city jerusalem that was a city where abraham sacrificed isaac on the mountain that was the very city david was the one that made that city the capital of israel when he brought the tabernacle in the city of jerusalem and built the tabernacle of david and named zion to be the centerplace because of that a man after god's own heart the thing there that that that impresses god david said ah i'm on a house of cedar and the ark of the lord that was the thing that moves god his desire even though he will not be the one to build the temple but his desire and just saying i mean i mean you took me from the ship called you took me from and and you have placed me you have given me the name in the earth and and you you have established me see see the kind of a roof i'm honored and the tabernacle the ark of the lord is on the tent the ark of the lord is away from israel that was the thing that attracted the god of heaven when a man has regard to the word of god when a man has regard to the word of god putting the word above our necessary needs it is that desire that god that it please god that even when he said it to nathan the prophet the prophet had no he had no second thought but to tell him david do all that is within your heart because the lord is rebelling praise the lord amen the prophet never even took a second thought until god has to visit him that night say no go back go back and tell david i had this thing all plain praise the lord but that was the thing that attracted god david wanted a house of god right in the city of jerusalem on the mount he wanted for the tabernacle of god to be exalted above all the houses in israel you can be down and look on the hill and says that is the house of the lord god that was what he wanted praise the lord and god took that place to heart because a man had a heart for god god looked down upon that place he says and and it was because of that he kept judah and if you read the history of the kings you realize the kings of israel they kept going into idolatry and idolatry and idolatry the kings of judah they were straight and god would bring one righteous king they would strain and god would bring one righteous king it was israel that was captured by the assyrian that's how this that's how samaritan was born but all along god kept judah he said i have to keep a light in judah because of my seventh david's sake a man who realized that all that he has become it was god that made it to him all he had he owe it to god and he was willing to give everything back to the one that gave it to him is that not the same thing of father abraham ready to give everything to the one that gave it to him we together praise the lord and we have to know that god established an everlasting covenant with david and everlasting in a sense as long as the earth remains david you will always have a seed on the throne an everlasting coveting even if your children heard that's what god said even if your children earth oh my goodness my head is spinning tonight praise the lord even if your children heard i'll leave that one for another day amen he says i will still keep i will find a way to redeem them to myself to still keep a seed on the throne because of my seven david's sake so this promise that he gave to david was an everlasting promise and from generation to generation the promise i mean god kept raising up a a man from the house of david from the sea lion of david because this promise was going is going all the way to the millennium amen is going all the way to the millennium this house of the lord that is established on top of the mountain now you have to realize now that the lord god does not dwell in temple means made with hands we will get into that because the millennium temples is not temple made with hands amen that is in daniel vision we will get to that as we as we uh as we travel together i mean um in a way that god speaks here uh the the scripture says uh in verse 3 and many people shall come and and come up and say come here and let us go up to the house of the lord and right in here the bible talks about the nations we speak about the gentiles that in verse 4 and he shall george among the nations speaking about the gentiles now it shows how the gentiles have been brought how the gentiles are being brought into the promise of david now you have to remember that there were gentile men that stood with david in the days that he was a fugitive praise the lord that is the reason why in acts chapter 13 when they were arguing about not arguing but they were discussing about whether the gentiles before they can be brought into the church there should be second side on that james said brothers you got to be careful when god spoke about the tabernacle of david he was talking about these people you have to know that there were men all the men that was standing with saul they were all they were they were all uh uh uh the men of the ahmed of israel they were all uh uh hebrew boys and they were seeking to kill their own brother and yet these gentile people that were not in the covenant of abraham for what reason they were anointed to stand with david i will tell you something that might shock you a little bit you won't pass out praise the lord but do you know that even the very men that were that were they were protecting the house of of of of david they were all gentiles uriah was gentile amen and they saw what david did to uriah but they never lift up their arm against david they never said oh he killed our brother we were revenge on them never because they had respect onto the office they have respect onto the anointing are we together a lot of things i could go into into that but i'll leave it for you for another time i want to get get our attention to this a little bit here so god kept a place for the gentiles he kept a place for the gentiles david praying and saying my god my god why have thou forsaken me but abraham says it's too bad and says how can they ever say this we are here david nobody can play time with you they did not understand they were not in the coveted but they were driven they were driven by purpose they were driving those men were ready to race their life bring david a cup of water when he saw how much the data he pulled down to the ground for a drink offering so god was thinking about you and myself because of what our fathers did praise the lord remember bannon one time in the prayer line he hired a little black girl that was blind and he held her so dear to his heart and said father remember when you were on the road to calvary one of our ancestors helped you for simon's sake give her her sight god remember he always remember we are enjoying the benefit we are enjoying the knowledge of the messiah we are enjoying the knowledge of the mystery of god because there were men not even knowing what they were fighting for but they were fighting they got so attached to this man david he did not rob them they believed his story more than even his brothers believe his story because david's story inspired those men when david keep telling them about killing the lion they all wanted to kill the lion until one had to jump in the snow and he killed the lion and he came out with his testimony because they believed david story are we together praise the lord but we have all of these things going on we have our mission this nation we have the word as a whole in chaos the whole word is in chaos the whole word noun is in a birth pain all of these things that is happening the word is in a birth pain that's the reason why nothing makes sense praise the lord that's why nothing makes sense what is happening to the world is just like the crave of a woman that is in birth pain or the crave of a woman that is caring child they asking max the accent sanitation they ask so it's a sign of birth being the word is going through birth pains praise the lord it's about the world is about to to to give birth to the city that abraham was looking for not me with hints praise the lord and i was reading this scripture the other day and and and studying about it were there was steady walls no more praise the lord you know if a person has ever been in an era of violence or riot or you know any form of violence whenever violence are repeating it has a way to trouble you i mean most of the people that are running in the street and burning places down uh uh they really don't know what they are doing they are just they are just overtaken by an evil spirit they're not fighting for no purpose they are now rioting for nothing that is right they are just possessed by an evil spirit because they are doing it more of of of hurt and all of that but what i'm saying tonight is that we have a city where there will be no more war there will be no more war praise the lord amen we have a city and that's the place that we have to be looking forward for because here there is no continuing city amen there is no continuing setting because it will it will pass away all of these places that are that have been burned down uh uh there was one right there on chicago the other there i i i i got there i mean they broke the whole thing down and and and and i mean when they broke it down i saw as i was passing by i tried to picture in my mind what what i knew it was they're going to wipe everything away they're going to build something there there is no continuing sitting that's just how the world will be praise the lord amen that's just how there is just no continuing city it's just going to be from one change to another change you and we have to know that is an element of time as long as we are in time there will always be changes that's one thing that time holds for us changes the bible says that the the heaven and the earth will pass away verb says it will be changed it goes through constant changing but no matter how they change it and no matter how they try to fix it better it will always need another keeping up or another change praise the lord if ariah don't take the city away a tornado will take it away if it is not a tornado a hurricane will take it away praise the lord i mean there are people there that is it texas that are going through a hurricane hurricane hanan they call it and that's the world that we caught that we are living in there will always be things happening especially around this time you know they were talking about uh you know uh eliminating the police you know what i thought about i can give you the call but bam says there will be a time where every house will pack a gun and if they ever try to do that that will come to pass that's the world that we are living in with all the changes and everything that is happening praise the lord but we have a city we have a city so you see why this few times i'm talking about the mountains and talking about your experiences you know what is the attraction on on your mountain i mean all the things that god been taking you through is now for increase in your salary it's not for the new house you're going to buy or the new car everything that god been taking you through is to prepare you for that setting it's for the city on the hill that we call mount zion amen praise the lord just like in the life of our father abraham god attracted him in different ways and god gave him different experiences and the more that abraham had one experience to another experience it increased his desire to look for that setting whose maker and bit and builder is god it's almost like if god can give me a child after 25 years what is it going to be if he can change my body what is it going to be in a city whose maker invader is god if god can give you a just an earnest of the inheritance you have a little peace of mind even though the devil comes here but you know where to carry your truth what is it going to be when you are completely free from stress the more you think about the city to come the more you appreciate the holy ghost the more you will appreciate what the holy ghost is if you don't have no desire for the sinner to come you don't even want the holy ghost because all your life is for this earth you live for this earth you die for this earth and you be condemned with this earth but there is a people who's looking for the city to come a city where they will study normal walls were there was steady no more wars my goodness did i pass my 25 minutes because it's just not a beginning to preach it's right now i'm starting to preach my goodness are we together but that's where we are going to that that that is the attraction that is the thing that god is attracting you to all it's not is not the pains of the suffering it's not the frustration of the trial but what he's attracting you to that there is a better land beyond the river that when all this is over you can sit at the banks of the river and say it worth it all you can sit at the banks of the river while other people waste their lives just to get in the right race of of of of a big house and uh and and and a better car and and and and when they realized then then you know then you know they have to pay for it anyway so they have to work more in and pay for it and put their life into all of that if god blesses us with that we appreciate it but it's not all we are putting our life into because we know that they are perishable there's a land beyond the river that is called the sweet forever there's a land beyond the river that is called the sweet forever have you ever thought about it to live can you imagine what noah was going through with the experience of being in the act free from trouble even the wave of the seed and the and the thunder it was just there to put them to sleep it was just enough to put them to sleep because if god can keep me in this lion then with the lion mob shot what more can he not do praise the lord what more can he not do you imagine how daniel came out how he came out of that lion then his life was not the same can you think about shadrach meshach and abednego having a confession that even if our god don't deliver us we are not going to burden but we know he's able to deliver us and for them to be in the fullness of fire not burn not burn for them to walk out oh you come and taste come and taste the lord and see that he's good you have not got a taste yet come and taste the lord and see that he's good when a man comes from out of those kind of atrials what more can you tell him what can you tell him about he don't have time to waste his time on lust and foolishness on the internet he don't have time because i mean it cooks you from the inside praise the lord daniel with all of his faith he's still there he prayed lord god of abraham isaac and jacob the god of our father noah you kept him in the ark lord father if this is my end i'll go and be with my fathers because sometimes those things the the the confession of faith comes from the soul you can't comprehend it it's not something that you comprehend and calculate oh when i get in there i would just be robbing the lion's head i'll be telling them you know lion you go yet you don't think about those things you don't think about those things like even those brothers they're in in the prison in in china you you can prepare your mind for that you can prepare your mind for that i remember one time you know going to a preach to some you know uh back home and we started you know just young street preachers and we're preaching to some some uh some soldiers rebels and uh you know right there we went and these guys know us you know but all this while we are visiting them they i mean they are military people this is a time of war and in their mind they are thinking this young men i did not own reconnaissance are they not finding a secret of this city so we went in and uh you know just there i'm i'm preaching and you know answering questions after everything listen gentlemen you identify yourself we took out our shoes before i know our shirts were off was sitting on the ground the whole thing changed all the laughter and joke and bible things were everything changed you can't prepare for those things you read those stories and you just think that daniel said his prayer all he knew that was that was a a a a praising for the most disobedient criminal they will throw you in there the lion will eat you that will be the end how the deliverance will come you don't calculate it in your mind this is not mind over matter he said his prayers he stepped in there when he go he go back a little bit oh my god lord oh jesus oh god and you're going like this and before he realized that then is shot only the sound will fear you the sound will run death from your head to your toes and he's sticking to the wall of the den thinking in his mind maybe they just ate that's why they are not rushing on me maybe they just have something to eat oh god commit myself in your hands praise the lord and then before he realized they were not even looking at him he said oh they are not looking at me oh thank you jesus then before it starts becoming real before it starts becoming real you remember when the angel took peter from out of prison he couldn't even believe it that he passed through those soldiers looking at them sleeping they get open oh wow he got outside he look at the prison really i'm outside you don't prepare it in your mind it's not premeditated but when you come from out of it there is a inner substance there is a inner substance that it builds oh i say coming see come and taste the lord and see that he's good don't just give in to i mean just oh well you know i'm um i didn't know what i was doing now don't don't just give in to the devil god is real he's a good god he said almighty god he can deliver we give in so easily praise the lord temptation can't kill it can't it's just there to tempt it does not kill you understand that temptation is just there to tempt it can kill you if you don't do it it will not kill you and we just come back again and tempt you i could keep you here all night and i don't want to do it praise the lord i don't want to do it i don't want to do it tonight i was listening to brother brennan uh future home he was saying that i wish that i can be able to bring this message to you in the inspiration that i got it and that's how i feel i feel the same in my heart that i wish i could be able to bring this to you amen it's not just to make a salmon but i want to be able to get a hold of your spirit and travel with it that there's a lane beyond the river musicians you can come for tonight amen there's a lane beyond the river i mean we will not have to study not only walls we will not have to study what is the cost of illness we will not have
