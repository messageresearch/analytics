[0:00] when God made the world in six days when
[0:02] he went to rest he rested from then on
[0:04] drying that settled it he didn't come
[0:07] back on the eighth day and start again
[0:09] it was only a shadow now that was a type
[0:13] like the moon to the Sun but when the

[15:33] like that it produces that and that's
[15:35] all they know it'll give life it's got
[15:37] power in it that's like the Spirit of
[15:39] God when you get one piece as you the
[15:41] other piece is God and get them run
[15:42] around together like that it'll do
[15:44] something for you it'll give light it'll

[22:49] filled with the Holy Ghost and spake the
[22:51] Word of God with boldness they got

[24:14] beginning it same things I'm talking
[24:16] about how God promised to pour toute the
[24:18] Holy Ghost
[24:18] while he spent seas
[24:20] the Holy Ghost fell oh man yeah that's
[24:26] what the Holy Ghost is whoo it's far
[24:28] sure and they were all filled with the
[24:30] Holy Ghost
[24:31] now notice in Ephesians that was a bad
[24:35] dispersed to law you're smart
[24:37] intelligent man know the law Briggs man
[24:40] a scholar one day got reading the Bible
[24:42] he's seen there would come one by the
[24:43] name of the Messiah and when he did that
[24:48] one he began to hear about this Jesus he
[24:50] said I'm convinced and I openly profess
[24:53] my faith that Jesus is the Christ the
[24:56] Son of God he was a real banker he come
[25:00] on I openly profess that Jesus is the
[25:02] Christ you got to do it it so much that
[25:03] God called him into ministry
[25:05] God will always speak to a true heart
[25:07] and there was a little tip maker down
[25:10] there banana Aquila and Priscilla a
[25:13] husband and wife David tentmakers Acts
[25:15] the 18th chapter tells you by Paul they
[25:18] were friends of his they had received
[25:20] the Holy Ghost or the hands of Paul in
[25:21] his teaching they heard there's revival
[25:24] there so they went over is only about
[25:25] ten or twelve painting it so he went
[25:28] over there to look at and he heard this
[25:29] preacher preaching the sincere he's
[25:31] already said you know I believe he'd
[25:32] listen to the truth
[25:33] so I asked his service or we call him
[25:35] out behind the tent and said look we got
[25:37] a little brother by so high a little
[25:38] hope knows you and but when he comes
[25:40] over here teaching the Word of God
[25:41] plainly well I sure while Paul was in
[25:44] jail at the same time awful face from
[25:46] modernistic preacher wasn't but he was
[25:49] in jail and Lord had him in there so
[25:51] absolute quick come shock to jail down
[25:53] he took to jail in his household and
[25:54] baptized them all in name the Lord Jesus
[25:56] alcohol come on over and it just cast a
[25:59] devil to have a little old girl down
[26:01] there telling the fortunes and then
[26:03] there's make a lot of money bar so he
[26:04] just expose their racket so then they
[26:07] put him in jail port Lord shook to jail
[26:09] now cause he had a bunch of people or
[26:10] hear the truth you can't buy in God's
[26:12] Word there's no matter what you in it
[26:14] you just can't do so he come over there
[26:16] to work this man wasn't a clue for
[26:18] Scylla maybe they had some sandwiches
[26:20] and right immediately
[26:21] to the sandwiches eat said were going
[26:23] with reliable Paulo set background Hill
[26:25] his little rollin listen this Baptist
[26:27] preacher preach that's fine what you
[26:29] preach let's see some more of them but I
[26:31] want to ask you a question
[26:32] doctor Apollo's have you received the
[26:36] Holy Ghost since you believe well he
[26:38] said we didn't know were there what do
[26:39] you mean by the Holy Ghost we're
[26:40] Baptists so how do you know you're bad
[26:43] to see well we was bad possibly only the
[26:45] baptism of John he said he only baptized
[26:47] unto repentance failure to be bond him
[26:50] to come that's on Jesus Christ and when
[26:52] he heard this they were baptized over in
[26:55] the name of Jesus Christ and Paul ladies
[26:57] hands upon them and the Holy Ghost came
[27:00] on a man they spoke in tongues and
[27:02] prophesied now now how do we do it I
[27:09] want to tell you something and I will
[27:12] close close it so I have told you I let
[27:13] you out early you don't want the Holy
[27:15] Ghost is for the last scripture far
[27:17] tonight
[27:18] I got another bunch down here but we'll
[27:20] have to omit that let's turn over to
[27:22] first Corinthians 12 and then we'll read
[27:25] this and then we all will close all
[27:30] right first corinthians the twelfth
[27:33] chapter
[27:34] how many breeds the teaching of st. paul
[27:37] sure he said in galatians 184 the angel
[27:41] called a zing different let him be
[27:42] accursed let alone a preacher if an
[27:46] angel from heaven come down taught
[27:48] anything different let him be cursed
[27:49] they don't have nothing to do with it
[27:52] now watch this first craziest 12 how how
[27:56] many knows that we have got to be in
[28:01] Christ an order to go on the reservation
[28:03] because it's his body that God promised
[28:06] to raise up in man there's no other way
[28:09] there's not another way if you're
[28:12] outside of Christ you might look back
[28:14] here and believe on me say sure I
[28:17] believe him
[28:18] he's a son of God good my brother I'm
[28:21] ready to shake your hand when you say
[28:23] that I believe on him I'll confess him
[28:26] as my savior that's good but you're
[28:28] still not easy I'll shake hands with the
[28:31] preacher I'll confess my sins that's
[28:34] still in
[28:35] now watch see what Paul said how you get
[28:38] in crime how you going to be noted as a
[28:40] circumcision Abraham they give a sign
[28:43] listen to this now first Corinthians
[28:45] twelfth chapter and let's begin at the
[28:49] twelfth first far as the body is one and
[28:52] has many members and all members of that
[28:56] one body being many are one body so also
[29:01] is Christ not divided one listen
[29:09] followed by one church some he's reading
[29:14] behind by one handshake by one water Oh
[29:22] and somebody's wronged by one spirit
[29:27] into the capsule
[29:29] that's Holy Spirit by one spirit are we
[29:34] all baptized into one body whether we be
[29:41] Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or
[29:44] free and have been all made to drink
[29:48] into one spirit the body of Christ is
[29:56] one spirit or every member from penny
[30:01] cost of this time drinks of the same new
[30:04] wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth
[30:08] the same results how do we do it by one
[30:13] spirit if God opened doors or Holy
[30:19] Spirit what is it if God opened doors
[30:22] it's a sign if the senior is the
[30:26] comforter it's an advocate if the
[30:29] discern its rent if peace is goodness if
[30:33] healing is right it is God's open door
[30:38] to all these things if God opened or
[30:42] just Christ which has God
[30:44] through that he raised up Jesus from the
[30:47] dead and those that are dead in Christ
[30:50] will God bring with him at the
[30:52] resurrection grieve not the Holy Spirit
[30:56] whereby you are is it Christ on children
[31:04] they are your Redemption
[31:07] how many pleases what is Christ what is
[31:12] the Holy Ghost it's not something people
[31:15] laugh at it is some people like that but
[31:18] it ain't to the believer to the
[31:21] unbeliever I wish I had a long to the
[31:24] rear weeks I'd like to take tomorrow
[31:25] night and tell you what it is to the

[31:34] it's a snare it's a stumbling block it's
[31:40] death it's eternal separation from God I
[31:46] just can't think of the thing that it is
[31:50] to the unbeliever

[32:05] spirit Holy Ghost that people are making
[32:09] fun of and says it's crazy and a bunch
[32:11] of nuts that's insanity it's the same
[32:17] thing that will rapture their church and
[32:19] take it up at the life phase will bring
