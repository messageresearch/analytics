bless you God bless you sitting again we love you in Jesus name and the music thank God who he is what you promise to do in our lives look what he just wanted you will to book a Galatians the first chapter begin reading at the eight through the 12th verse Galatians 1 8 through 12. God is good if you haven't seen amen policy here I Marvel again I'm sorry again this sit first through the seventh verse down to the 12th verse I'm sorry yes at least one six 12. and now they are so soon removed from him that caused you and to the grace of Christ and to another gospel oh my God help us can I read it again yeah I marveled that ye are so soon removed from him that causes you until the grace of Christ and to another gospel Paul said he had put there not another but there is some that trouble you and will pervert the gospel of Christ nine well Paul said here in eight verse but don't we oh yeah angel from heaven preaching gospel to you then that which we have preaching to you than the cursed are you with me and as we said before are we gonna hear the folk brother so see I now again if anything you see let her do a curse but now do I persuade men of God how do I seek to please men but if I seek to please men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you Brothers that the gospel would preach a knee and not after man well I received it it a man I need to see see a man rather neither will that Target but that revelation as you do Christ I'll read it again another name but the devil but I need to received a man yes yes neither would that taught you but by the revelation Lord Jesus again not the word not your hero look at that we find good soil and we think of 49 in Jesus name amen you deceited in your presence in a coat amen ever Force stated my lesson today the Lord again that a test your whole kind of hope you had you help you to follow this morning living a whole year long but listen today is Victory Day I'm the lead today and that subject this morning I really I want to kind of press on very strongly that grace of God don't let the enemy reroute you don't let the enemy reroute you oh my goodness now you know as he experiencing then and particularly then pastor first few of your pastor Pastor one all we dealing with people even that sometimes they one of their uses for not receiving the word come on many times he want to blame one another and blame others because many times are there unbelief because of their not really dedicated and sealed to the Lord at his shoe that once should one bling others for them not being what he should be in the Lord that's right yes sir that's right God help us and and somehow I don't get this came to me that that I shared it with the church and I would press to share this with you maybe that helped some of you and maybe sometimes that you uh in church you know then sometimes you get distracted that's right when you come he come too that's right and uh so that's why we have to look we must come ask Lord help us to create the atmosphere yes that's right with him yes we come to visit here we come you know and look at Fellowship there's a time we come to church yes sir you want to be you ain't God yeah because you want that connection with God in service but you know the inner always pass some heart away if you don't be mindful he'll try to distract you yeah that's right but hearing what God has for you that will take the day an hour Pastor running and it really and then was to me was saying something to help us and this it kind of the story here they said that you know how assuming they had in this church and I guess it was a wide Pastor you know and he kind of uh said I'm gonna do this I can help some of those folks say well past you know uh I come to church and you know how many times people stay in the back of the church going on and because they're not focus said it should get distracted looking at other folks yes right because they would do just that right they call you to miss what God want to say to you as an individual so it says here I want to read here what that's to say what happened the world that he said man I went to the pastor of his church and said I want attending church anymore he said may I ask why I said a pastor he said that I see people on their cell phone passing in python doing service I see some gossiping some just aren't living right so it just are sleeping so much staring at me no hear the Chris silent then he said can I ask you to do something for me before you knit your final decision he said sure what that he said take a glass of water and walk around the church two times yeah and don't let the water fall out of the glass he said yes I can do that you know so he went and got a glass of water and walked around the church two times he came back and said it had done the doctor asked him do you see somebody on their phone do you see somebody gospeling with anybody living wrong do you see anybody sleeping he said I didn't see anything because I was so focused on the glass hey come on rage it's an Open Door preach brother he said I didn't see anything I was so focused on the glass so the water wasn't Spilled Out he said he told him what to go to church it should be just that focus on God can you see me I believe you know that that that's what many times we we don't really focus on God that's right because it always there trying to distract you from the things that God has for you so I just want to encourage you today keep your focus on the word amen because I tell them to eat then many times that's the one that uh some people will continue so you know and said you know I I see things going on and uh so I think I'm just leaving that's okay so you live for a perfect Church I said we just find that perfect Church called me I'm the John for you John because we know they're not penis perfect Church within the body of Christ well I have thoughts and failure but with the love of God in our lives that's right yes sir because our father said how do you say God when you're serving one another that's right can you see you man so he said this then and this is to Paris and then this youth again today is don't let the devil we got you man father said I want to give you a woman right here and see concerning the last day that the cause of the bounding iniquity the level Nina's will he said will that's cool say in Atlanta sin uh last age y'all see it don't you yeah self-love my God and love from the pure things will take the place of the true love of God somebody's saying then he said we need you got to get the power of sin in the last day so then they're getting so hard the car they haven't realized is back of the land-day spirit y'all with me is it time to go now to God let him feel that I was blind with his love are we refilled the coldness of the Larry church and reject the truth of God push along the able to help us my assistant brother this morning we need to take heed to these things because we're in the last days but I do the grace of God and the power of the Revelation is out to the message that all we know that God given us that peace of God in the midst of the storm called a piece of God that there's a lot of understanding to keep your heart in Mind through Christ Jesus yeah so that's a neighbor but remember this that the four days of the other day or something amen God I can test you and I took her every son and daughter to God that he tested and tried amen look what he said here and then this is Victory Day He said this he said Sheila had a v-day one time he was scared to go back to his brother because he had done evil but yet the Holy Spirit began to warn him in his heart returning back to the Homeland where you come from you come from the Homeland you've done all you've done evil over there now I'm sending you back and when he got closer got course certainly decorative devil is sold after us adult y'all see what I'm saying that's right that's what it tell me so after I stood out see therefore the devil is so after the drive the church right so for now it getting close to p-day yeah man he said that's right she getting real close that's what he ended up is worse the reroute you that's my test today don't let the devil we watch it you know you can get into v-day the Lord continue to think to your heart and said Lord I need a personal revelation Revolution oh no because if I take your real Nation it doesn't talk a lot of it but when I get God I hear from God did nothing no devil no demon no individual to talk me out hello somebody but the way God is sealed that holy ghost in my soul value [Music] they'll rescue you and everything you're going through somebody glory to God glory to God to watch help us Lord he said therefore they they were so after that therefore they they were so after the pride the church for it's so close you're getting close to every day that's right she's getting real close it's a matter of real close that's where the end of the worst to reroute all right it's not until God thank you
