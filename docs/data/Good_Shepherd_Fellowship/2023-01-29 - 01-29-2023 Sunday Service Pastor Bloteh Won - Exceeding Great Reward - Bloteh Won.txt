be all for the music and before we go into what we want to speak on this morning as we would trust the Lord to help us uh uh I have a short uh video that I want to share with you you know I've been I've been picking things on on design uh so uh if the if they would just switch this light off and and share their video with with us uh this morning it's just it's just few few minutes and then we can go into what we want to talk talk about this morning open your eyes and let the world in follow me on a journey into your body's second most complex organ after the brain but pay attention now all of this will happen in the blink of an eye first job at hand get inside let's follow this dust particle it floats up and lands on the cornea that's the outer Dome covering your eye you can feel its shape right now close your Lids put your index finger over them wash your hands first and move your eyes side to side feel that bump that's it no blood vessels here your corneas get oxygen directly from the air so your eyes breathe but it's full of super sensitive nerves they sense something foreign and the fastest muscles in your body get to work your eye blinks that dust particle gets washed away let's try this again the only way to get into the eye is with light that's how your Vision Works and it's why you can't see in the dark duh but how do we see objects that don't emit light themselves the light coming from the source be it a light bulb or the Sun hits the object some of it gets absorbed and some of it bounces off and enters our eye it's a nice reflection on you more on that a bit later for now it's way too dark in this room somebody flip a switch Ah that's better we Zoom along going the speed of light and pass through the cornea it Dome shape to help focus light where it goes next the lens but before we get there we pass through the pupil it's not a black circle in your eyeball it's a hole black because there's no light inside your eye red eye and flash photos is because the light from the camera is passing through and bouncing off the back of your eye it's full of blood vessels in there so your pupils glow red but this pupil is too small I can barely squeeze through oh the light's too bright the tiny muscles in your irises that's the color part of your eye we know and Admire have relaxed to make the pupil smaller this doesn't let too much light in and protect your eyes from excessive brightness turn the lights down a little and the iris muscles contract the pupil gets bigger as the eye demands more light to be let through there we go we pass through and come upon the aspirin-sized lens like your ears and nose your lens continues to grow throughout your whole life and just like in a camera it focuses the light even more that way it hits exactly where it needs to be on the retina that's the back of the eye I can see our human here is nearsighted things far away are blurry look at where the lens is focusing the light into a single point it's not on the retina but a little before it this happens when your eye is slightly too long if you're far-sighted things up close are blurry that focal point goes behind the eye because your eyeball is too short don't worry it's nothing a pair of glasses can't fix oh it's roomy in here that I thought hello hello well it's because you only see about 1 6 of your eye when you look in the mirror the rest of it is inside your head your eyes themselves are about the size of ping pong balls and just within this seemingly small little organ there are over two million working parts well hold on everything's shifting to the right whoa now to the left our human must be looking for something your eyes move thanks to six muscles holding them in the socket certain ones contract and your glance changes Direction up down left right all around okay things have calmed down so let's continue following the light projection say you're looking at a big bright Apple sitting on a blue table a yellow light bulb hangs above if you could see the image in here it'd be upside down on the back screen of your eye it's because the lens bent the beam but you can't see this picture on the retina because eyes aren't projectors it's just light hitting some tissue on the back wall of your eyeball there are nerves and special receptors back there they turn the light coming into your eye into nerve impulses the brain then decodes and makes sense of so we journey further here are those receptors they can be cones or rods cones are the reason your incredible eye can detect up to 7 million colors surprisingly though your cones come in only three types red green and blue it's the combination of their work that allows you to see magenta chartreuse or cyan except for colorblind people they might be missing one of those types or they don't work as they should so these people don't see certain colors at all or things aren't true to their color for example if there's something wrong with your green sensitive cones green and yellow look reddish brown there are also your rods they pick up black white and over 500 Shades of Gray in between way more than 50 Shades of Gray you also have more of them than cones and the rods are mostly in charge of your peripherals yep everything outside your direct field of vision looks like old black and white TV rods also help you see in low light the photoreceptors in your eyes are so sensitive they can even project an image when it's not even there ever looked at a bright light closed your eyes or turn off the light and you can still see the shape of that light bulb floating before your eyes that's your photoreceptors continuing to send visual information to your brain your rods and cones are connected to neurons so the data gets passed there and makes its way to your optic nerve this is where blood vessels and the main path to the brain enter and exit the eyeball this is also where your blind spot is there are no rods or cones here you can test it too grab a piece of paper in a pen I'll wait okay make a DOT on the left side praise the Lord it's going to use the allies of bit to get your attention this morning and Jesus said I read some few things here before we we get into what we want to deal with this morning and that is just uh uh a science report a little bit of of the second the second most uh complicated part of our body over in Matthew chapter 13. over in Matthew chapter 13. Jesus after dealing with The Parables of the Soul he he said these words Matthew 13 verse 13 therefore I speak to them in Parables because they're seeing seeing that and hearing the year net neither do they understand for in them is fulfill the prophesied of his eyes which said by hearing years a year and shall not understand and seeing here shall I see and shall not perceive for this people heart his Works grows and their ears are thought of hearing and their eyes they have clothes least at any time they should see with your eyes and year with their ears and you understand with your heart and she'll be converted and as you heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for the year if you have followed that documentary a little bit you will realize that your ears are given to you for balance it helps to balance you or as you will be leaning on one side as small as they are they stick on your head they are given to you to keep your body imbalance praise the Lord so Jesus said but but blessed are your eyes for the sea in your ears for the year for verily I said unto you there are many prophets and righteous men have desire to see those things which yes it praise the Lord let's stand on our feet Genesis chapter 15. we trust the Lord to be able to help us this morning I will come back to death I will come back to that to show how the the eyes is very important we are living in a word uh never at time were pictures you have cameras everywhere I mean people are so smart that they're listening they are able to grab it on their phone and uh and all of those things they all looks like uh you know technology age and the advancing of Technology but all is signaling to us is to show how our eyes are important praise the Lord but yet we don't we don't uh realize it and uh well let's read Genesis 15 that's where we read last week we are just going back uh again to look at this subject we've been dealing with after these things Genesis 14 where God uh chasing the neck met Abraham after those things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision we're dealing with the eyes this morning pay attention saying fear not Abraham I am the shade and the exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God what shall thy give me sin I go childish it looks like sea ice Vision they're all popping up all over the scripture now since we have looked at the eyes and Abraham said Lord God what shall thou give me sin I go childless in the Seal of my house is Eleazar of Damascus and Abraham said behold to mean they all have not given no seed and load one born in my house is manheared and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying they shall not be done here but he that shall come forth out of thou own ball shall be than his and he brought him forth abroad and said look open your eyes look use your eyes look look now towards heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be let's pray together father we are so grateful Lord we are so grateful we wake up in the morning by your grace and our eyes comes open we are able to identify our dwelling we can come from the room we can do things and father all of these years Lord since we were birthing since we came to consciousness of saying we have used our eyes for different things Lord but do we really appreciate it do we really ow look at the designer and a great design that father you have given to us there's a place where in your word you said that I those eyes are the light of the body father I'm just trusting you this morning as we look into this subject father I pray that God you will just can't break your word now into our hearts Lord I pray to God you will take the burden the inspiration of my heart and minister to the needs of your children this morning we thank you we appreciate you father in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so we see dwelling on our subject of uh exceed in faith and see it in righteousness actually is exceeding righteousness Jesus said except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the stripe and Pharisees you will know what into the kingdom of heaven so we've been looking at seating righteousness and looking at the different types that are in the scripture but before I go to there let me read a quote here from crisis reveal in his own world getting back on that uh subject of our video see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete sea and it comes out through the feet Luther comes back out through Wesley then into Pentecost the tongue in the lips see now is the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4. now what he's dealing here with is that if we want to take this back to the Bible you will realize that when God give Daniel that great vision that Daniel had actually he interpreted uh came Nebuchadnezzar dream of the great image now that image was representing the the gentai kingdom how God will deal with the Gentile Kingdom coming from the time of Babylon to our time which now we are in uh biblically we are under the Roman Empire that is represented by the Catholic church that is ruling the word whether you believe it or not is the truth praise the Lord amen so uh uh so their Vision that God gave Daniel you have to realize that God was giving Danny their Vision concerning the time of the end praise the Lord so you will see that the vision represented the the the political powers that that will mix with religious powers that will have ruled the Gentile Kingdom like I said even till our time so it came from the head of gold to the feet of clay and iron now so brother Branham took that in crisis reveal in his own word and says when God showed Daniel that Vision interpreting Nebuchadnezzar dream there was something also that was ended in a vision there was a rock that was caught out of the mountain and it smashed the image on the feet pray to praise the Lord amen and when he smashed the image on the feet a uh uh uh the image trauma the image failed so now brother Branham is making us to realize that after God struck that image on the feet he started now building a a a spiritual Kingdom now because it was hit on the feet he now started building from the feet up praise the Lord amen he started building from the feet up so that's what now he's he's now applying to the church ages the time of the Reformation what God was doing when God brought Luther to take those Theses over to the church there then uh you know call the people out of capitalism when God brought Westlake and he brought a Revival uh uh uh uh there in England and and Azusa Street the Pentecostal what was God doing all of this move of God that was taking place Through the Ages what was he doing he was rebuilding that image right but now it's a spiritual Kingdom are we together now so he's he's making us succeed in understand that uh right from the first church age which would be the time of Paul amen we should be the time of Paul where there was there was uh uh uh you know one of the the the greatest missionary work the spreading of the Gospel all of those uh Apostles in the All Saints in the book of us the Bible says that they saw what they have they laid it down at the Apostle Faith because God at that time was staring The House of the people to carry the gospel around the word amen so that was a great missionary age we we can see that they were they were there in the feet now so he he's bringing us to this place to realize now where we are where we are in our age and to be able to see the things that has been revealed to us the word that has been preached to us it is because we are in the eye age like the scripture who says the art of the Lord move your toe and fold throughout the Earth what was that God was raising up man His prophets Through the Ages like the Bible which says over there in in the book of First Samuel that in that time the word of God was precious because there was no prophet amen in a time of the judges the Bible says every man did what was right in their eyes because there was no prophet are we together so he's making us to see here with God's promise of sinning in Malachi for behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the Great and the Dreadful dead of the law with that promise of God he's making us to understand yeah God is prop he have promised us to send a prophet back uh a prophetic Ministry so that prophetic Ministry now is once again going to be the eye of God yeah so he's making us to see that where we are now back in that I'm uh in that image of God we are in the high age then he will say the next thing after the eye is the brain the intelligence praise the Lord and if you follow that documentary that's what he said that the next complicated part of the body next to the brain is the eye hmm now so while uh he says here then to the Pentecostal uh uh the Tonk you know Birdman says that because that's that's what God did in the Pentecostal age he gave them the gifts of speaking in tongues they live see noun is the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4. and so forth and now there is nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because there's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of Our Own is his we have no sight of Our Own praise the Lord you see that's why Jesus could tell nicodemon says a Scarlet of the Lord and that unless you are born again you will not see the kingdom of heaven praise the Lord the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own is his we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee those things praise the Lord he can do it is God himself is is becoming to a place and and he's governed the body all the way true then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side praise the Lord let's take another thought here from Exposition of the church AJ she says let me show you another reason why Satan hit this book that's Book of Revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and he changed that he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 percent of the theologians he knows their sins God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways the Satan knows assured that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claimed as his own or else is false it has to be and remember this Christ in the truth church is the continuation of the book of Acts amen but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defy it making it lukewarm former powerless a exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word Jesus said the enemy comes to Steed kill and destroy praise the Lord amen that's what Jesus says now brother bear is now bringing that that uh saying of Saint John 10 into context here the enemy comes to destroy or to discredit amen when the word is discredited it reduce its effect in our lives we think that it is no longer important again it was only an Old Testament thing praise the Lord amen he discredit now so let's read a little bit here attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he's going to do it he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the revelation of the truth church and what she stands for what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works now as as we read that and and brother Branham is talking about the revelation of the true church and what she stands for I would go back to uh uh uh the tape the the marriage and divorce tip that was playing this morning and I will I will want us to pay attention to to as we go through that we've been we've been looking at the entire series you have to pay attention because brother Branham brings their subject with a lot of types amen you will see it as he was talking this morning he's making emphasis on the woman and he's bringing the church in now the danger there is that over the years we kept our mind on the physical woman and never understand that it was a message for the church praise the Lord so yeah he's saying if that if the church if if the church would get the Revelation for what she stands for amen what she stands for so let's go back there let's read that again I just I just thought I should I should make an emphasis on that because sometimes it throws people off amen praise the Lord and and then you are hearing all of those things that brother Brandon was saying and it looks like uh uh uh uh and and if if if the devil can just get your mind on the physical woman you will never see the message that is coming to the church praise the Lord because what he's showing us there is that how did the devil break the continuity of God amen because the same thing that happened in Eden is the same thing that is happening to the church today how come we have all of these denominations praise the Lord the more increasing that we have in churches the less we are seeing the Life of Christ and we're seeing all I mean all the scandals you can you can think about all the scandals from woman women filthiness everything in the church how did we go to this place why because that contributed from the book of Arts the church in power was broken is showing us immersion divorce the same way God the devil took Eve from the word to break the continuity of God that's the same way he took the church from the word that's why we don't see the effect of Christ we are just stuck with denomination in our mind so let's look at the word let's read between the line let's understand the types are we together he fights it the devil fights revelation he cannot stand it he knows that if the people if the people if we the people can get the revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works praise the lord we will now say that base or Miracles it's past when I said it's only for the apostles because we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever are we together what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get the true revelation of the two spirit within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her praise the Lord amen because that was that was that was where he fell she did not descended that but now we have been empowered by the word to wash the two spirits that is working not just following the sensation but bringing everything back to the world it must match with the word Satan will be powerless before her he will be miss my spot here now and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit will be powerless before her he will be definitely strong today as when Christ was withstool his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hits Revelation but we love it wave the true Revelation in our lives the gifts of hell what is the true Revelation in our life Christ in you the hope of glory praise the Lord it is that true Revelation Christ in you the hope of glory that's where we find Grace amen to trust the Lord for the things that are beyond our reach yes Satan is there but we love it with true Revelation in our lives not in our head but in our lives the gifts of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail we will prevail over them you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message uh this uh and and in this book that we are studying is actually the revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two tasks together you will see that it won't take just ordinary steady and thinking to make this book real is going to take an operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can be revealed to anyone by a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight now so we will go back to that image of the eyes that we just we just look at praise the Lord amen we you see things you know uh and how the colors come together you know you you just you know uh and and and and and how beautiful I just didn't want to take a lot of the time on on the documentary but uh it's very beautiful when you when you follow it you just you just said uh what an awesome God that we sell amen his great design that he would give us eyes to see praise the Lord amen now so uh and that is the same thing with God's word that's what I want for us to realize here because we are talking to everybody we are talking about Abraham sorry and uh looking at God promising him that I am your great and exceeding reward last week we look at how he went out there and and helped to redeem his brother a lot and after the king of Sodom was was thinking to reward him and Abraham said no I won't take anything and and he refused and right after that the Bible says after that after these things God appeared unto Abraham in a vision and says I am your great and you're exceeding reward I am your reward praise the Lord Hallelujah and Abraham is asking God and a lot seeing that I go challenge I have this promise of having a son amen but all around me not just my servants I love them they love me but they are not my sons they are not my children it's not one from me praise the Lord now so God now is going to ask Abraham how are you looking how are you looking what are you looking at yeah praise the Lord amen and the scripture said he brings Abraham outside and he said look at the heavens look at the heavens if you can Number the Stars up there my promise to you I'll make you a father of Nations praise the Lord sister Catherine if you go to mine my images that I wanted to for us to look at take the one that has resolving power resolving power now this this resolving power it is uh our eyes have the ability to do this but you can in great battle ever father bam talks about uh people that study the the Stars he says you can you can look get out look at the heavens look at the stash you know if you are not in a line of steady but what what this is is the other you might look at look at the heavens and you are looking at a setting star and uh maybe you take a telescope based on how expensive and how effective your telescope is you might look at a star and then uh it might look like won't start to you but then if you take a better telescope and then you look at that very same style you will realize that uh it's two different styles amen and uh uh the people that do their work you know they can be able to like but bam says you know they can be able to explain the zodiacs explain they have on their bodies to you if you are not in that line of working you don't have the right equipment you will not understand anything about it and you see God's promises in his word just like he did to Abraham his promises in his word are just like the stars in the heavens praise the Lord amen I mean try try to do it and you get out there and pretty soon you are counting and you don't know if you have counted this one oh man let me go back again and then pretty soon you lost you don't know which one you have counted and you can get the number right are we together praise the Lord so you see this it's uh it's it's just like that when you are looking into the word of God now there there are some things that we share with you on this revolving power but it will take me it would take me out of my my trench of top this morning so let's just let's just go back thank you thank you for that you can put the light back on and uh so you see that's that just how uh uh uh you know uh the the promises of God is now he gave Abraham this promise it was God that called Abraham Genesis chapter 12. I make thee a father of Nations now with that called you know the way we process things in our mind sometimes I I'm sure believe that Abraham thinks in no time that's why brother Brandon would will demonstrate that he went and shopping he got baby things he bought he bought all of those things because in his mind he thinking that you know God is going to do this thing but how many years is talked 25 years praise the Lord amen but God's word will stay true like the very day he said it to Abraham praise the Lord the promise he made to Abraham was true from the very day he left out of the lips of God that word was truth and it still remain truth because God brought his word to pass but here God is going to uh make Abraham to realize what are you looking at are you looking at your physical body you're looking at your age are you looking at your strength or are you looking at my promise praise the Lord why he made Abraham to look at the stars and so tell Abraham the same word that I spoke to you about a promise is the same word that created those ties I spoke those Stars into existence the same way I spoke to you concerning a son look at the stars if you can number them my word hang those stars in the heavens that's the same word my word is hanging my promise over you no matter what your body goes through while your mind goes through the word of God will come to pass because God said so amen I am your exceeding yeah your share you are sitting in great reward praise the Lord amen I am your reward oh it just can make me I'm getting this excited now amen praise the Lord but let's do a little steady here let's do a little study we are looking at uh exceeding faith amen oh I see it in righteousness let's go over to First Timothy chapter one First Team chapter one hey the problem is always what we are looking at amen the problem has never been God when it comes to God and his promises praise the Lord amen he has always been what we are looking at let's let's look at first team yeah hmm sorry let's go back to Matthew chapter five let's go back that's That's the basis of where we are studying so let's go back let's do a little review so we can be able to carry everybody along amen let's go back to Matthew Chapter 5 reading from verse 17 that was where we started thinking that Jesus said I've come to destroy the Lord thing that that I am come to destroy the Lord or the prophets I am now come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I say unto you till heaven and F pass one job or one Tittle we look at that and if our sisters will help us again and and throw that image up we look at that last week on that uh uh Jordan title praise the Lord just go back to the to our image there Let's uh let's just do a review here is the one with uh the Matthew chapter five okay now so uh uh yeah the strip chart is there thing that I've come to destroy the Lord or the prophets are not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I said unto you till Heaven is passed now one jot it means that uh a yuck in the in the Hebrew is a York so it is just this apostrophe that is that is attached to that word and and also at tether also it's an apostrophe it means just like I said in the English we would say the crossing of the eye the crossing of a t and the dotting of the eye amen God is saying not one Crossing of a t or the dotting of the eye in my word is going to to fill amen I'm going to cross every T and Dot every eye that concerns your life praise the Lord you will you will appreciate this when you go in a scripture where Jesus was telling the the Pharisees asked him and said when David said this who was he talking about my law said unto my Lord amen the answer that Jesus gave them and the Bible says the the Pharisees never said a word to him the word he used won't change it was a York it was just under pressure and when and when Jesus used that they honest to immediately that the son of David was going to be the Messiah praise the Lord so you see every part of God's word it's a complete design amen it's a complete design every story in the Bible is from the great mind of God so Jesus saying the other you know every every portion of God's world will be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of the commandment and shall teach men so he shall be called the lease in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach men the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven for I say it unto you that accept your righteousness shall exceed that was where this whole subject began now since the month we've been dwelling on it except your righteousness and see the righteousness of the stripe and the Pharisees yesha in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven so we've been looking at exceeding righteousness now you will you will you will appreciate the context of that when you when we look into the scripture and you realize that it is not only righteousness that God have expressed uh that sense of exceeding righteousness but you will see that God talks about the exceeding of Grace he talks about the exceeding of Faith he talks about the exceeding of power now first Timothy chapter one like I said let's look at that because what there what did God tell Abraham years I am your great and exceeding reward amen and he's the one Abraham is the one that God impute righteousness to praise the Lord so we realize here that this exceeding righteousness is what God rewarded Our Father Abraham wave and if God rewarded Our Father Abraham with a seed in righteousness is now something that is going to be difficult for him to do for you and myself that righteousness is not after our works and how good we are now because our Father Abraham was in Eden First Timothy chapter one let's read from verse 12. he says I thank Christ Jesus our lord who have enabled me for that he counted me faithful put him in into the ministry praise the Lord look at the background of this Paul was from the trap of Benjamin I call him to the Leviticus Lord he could never be a priest because the priest was from the tribe of Levi are we together amen so Paul yeah now he's after his experience on the road of Damascus he's looking into the word and he's seeing all of these things you know he's the one talking about uh uh melchized there in Hebrew and he's you know the Lord is dealing with him opening his eyes to the things that align in the Lord and he's being grateful amen who have come to me or enable me that I encountered to be faithful putting me into the ministry for who was before a blasphemer a persecutor amen Paul now talking about himself now I persecute the church I blasphemed this very thing that I'm that I'm that I'm I'm preaching to you praise the Lord [Music] amen but our team Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus praise the Lord now there is the same exceeding except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the strap in Pharisees can you imagine all the people there on the mountain listening to Jesus when when these men they have they have they have great regard and respect for them in the way they dress and the way they conduct themselves you know being they've been taught the law since the age of 12 and and uh and in your mind they're thinking whoa righteousness can they see these people these are the men that we know to be righteous men praise the Lord but we realize that Jesus was talking about something that that God was going to put upon the church he was going apart upon the ones that were now walking amen the ones that were not good he was going to he was going to take us down from our law state and bring us into the boson of the father praise the Lord now Paul is expressing the same year I persecute this very thing I was up I was I I've blasphemed the name of the Lord Jesus because because of thy name that was the thing that passed through the games who is this man Jesus because of that he persecuted the church but yet he's realizing that God was exceedingly abundantly in Grace love and faith to him second Thessalonians chapter 1. realizing the way that God there with the Apostle Paul he was grateful praise the Lord he was very grateful for the many things that he did experience second Thessalonians chapter one verse 2 Grace unto you and peace from our Our God peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we are bound to thank God always for you brethrens as it is meat because of your faith because that's your faith sorry because that your faith growth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you All To Us each other abundant abundant praise the Lord so here also Paul is expressing Faith That Glory exceedingly praise the Lord you see because this word holds a whole's uh a meaning you have to realize that the translation is from Greek to English and this word is the same word where we get our word supermarket or sometimes they will say a hypermarket that word exceedingly praise the Lord let's take Ephesians chapter one also Ephesians chapter 1 let's read from verse 17. they are the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom in Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened they are yea may know what is the hope of his calling what is the riches of his glory all the inheritance in the sins and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe praise the Lord now so Paul is is talking here also almost like God telling Abraham come and look at the stars he's saying that God will Enlighten your eyes of understanding so you can be able to see that there is an exceeding power now the thing that will walk through you will not be your effort but God needs to open your understanding to that or else you will just be struggling to make things happen so what are you looking at what are you looking at Abraham Abraham counting his age I'm getting old I don't have no child what are you looking at God says okay come on come outside come come look at the heavens praise the Lord amen amen let's take one more year Romans Romans chapter 8. let's take one more year we'll find a place to to close this thing so we see we realize that the same God that that uh that uh that that that produce the exceeding righteousness is the same God that is going to bring uh exceeding Faith to the church this is the same God that is going to bring exceeding power to the church this is the same God that has given us exceeding Grace to be able to live in the hour and the day that we are living in he is a God that gave us exceeding strength he says Abraham I am your great and you are exceeding reward I'm going to bless you with things that will overpass your strength is going to overpass your age it's going to overpass your ability what are you looking at praise the Lord Romans chapter 8. this wonderful wonderful book of Paul year let's read from verse 31. so hard to find where to stand because everything is good what shall we say then what shall we say what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spare near his own son but deliver him up for us all how shall he met with him also freely gave us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect praise the Lord who is the man that is able to condemn praise the Lord what right do you have what do what do you know about this person praise the Lord amen the app that you see the person is not all about their life are we together who shall LED anything to the Church of God's elect it is God that justify it who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yeah rather that is Raising again who is even at the right hand of God who also make an intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ praise the Lord who shall separate us I love this I love this I've I've Loved this from from the time that God started opening my eyes to understand the scripture uh many years back I have loved this because there has really been comforting to me that Paul who says who shall separate us then he says shall tribulation shall distress praise the Lord Hallelujah you understand what I'm good now amen because if it was just our trials and our trouble the right way to phrase it is what shall separate us but the Apostle Paul want us to realize and identify that there is a personality behind whatever we are dealing with it's a sickness whether it is financial problem who is the one is the cause of that who shall separate us shall tribulation distress persecution farming making this prepared or swamp as it is reaching for that sake we are killed all day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter made in all these things we are more than conquerors praise the lord we are more than conquerors through him that love us now do you do you see the word exceeding year Thy word more than conquerors praise the Lord amen be more than more than the Conqueror means that you did not conquer it you are only rejoicing in the victory amen you have been rewarded for the battle that you did not fight you are more than the Conqueror praise the Lord someone conquer it and then you you are giving the reward that's the exceeding righteousness amen you have been rewarded for accepting the righteous one not rewarded for your righteousness but you are rewarded because you have embraced the righteous one praise the Lord you can confess your weakness amen and then you can embrace the strong one you are more than conquerors praise the Lord are you grabbing the picture do you see why Jacob uh uh uh Judah has to say Tema is more righteous than me amen why he had to say that because Judah realized that she was looking to the promise she wanted to be identified in the lameness of Abraham praise the Lord he promised this young woman okay when my when my little boy get older you will marry him and he kept him away now let's think now this is a common common human mind well my first son died you didn't have a child the second one I don't know what's going on here praise the Lord amen and she's realizing the other I I don't know what is going on I mean the bodies of Ash now we should be married she said okay I'm not going to fight for him I'm going for the father himself praise the Lord I'm going for the father himself he will just set to the case glory be to God amen so it was not it was not the art of tema that Judah called righteousness it was the thought amen it was the desire that she had in her heart to be identified with this group of people praise the Lord it was not her eyes because the art was filthy the ad was wrong but the desire that she had of wanted or wanting to be counted in The Blessing of Abraham should I say she's more righteous than her amen he said what can I give you he said bring me in a cake she knew there was no kid around give me the god okay let me go and get okay now if you want to go and get it give me your staff give me your bracelets and as soon as he was gone she went away praise the Lord we are more than conquerors through him they love us praise the Lord you see many times when we when we read the word of God sometimes God is just expressing what is his desire what what he wants to achieve in our life he's telling us what he wants to achieve but we are receiving it as what he want us to do amen he's speaking to you when he says uh I I love you just that there in in Exodus chapter 19 he said I brought you out I brought you out uh on on Eagle wings amen speaking to Moses in the group if you will love me with all of your heart and keep all of my Commandments now God is expressing to them I I brought you out I want to keep you ass a treasure to me amen but the way they're understanding us if God is giving them a law then the Bible said they said all that the Lord has required we will do amen it depends on what you are looking at how are you listening what are you hearing when the word is preached are you hearing condemnation amen what are you hearing or are you hearing the voice of a father that is saying come up Heather amen are you hearing the voice of a father that is saying I have loved you with an everlasting love are you hearing the voice of a father that is saying that I took a picture of you I'm going back to that picture thing amen praise the Lord I took a picture of you right from the beginning the Bible says he he has predestinated us that we should walk before him holy in love with our blame amen how can you do that when we are all born the same shape like in iniquity so you see that's the reason why the prophet will come and let us know that he took a picture of you right from his mind and it's that image that he has kept before him praise the Lord that's the image that he have kept before him that's the reason why he have he had the heart to take on flesh and come and pay for our sin because he has kept a perfect picture before him and he want to bring us back to that state praise the Lord so the people there uh uh uh uh the man of olive all the way hearing Jesus saying wow who can live holy amen who can live holy then then but he's he already told I never came to destroy the Lord I came to fulfill it I came to do what the Lord could not do because no man was justified by the Lord I'm here to lift you out of the condemnation of the Lord and to express my love and my life through you praise the Lord what are we looking at sometimes we get so stuck you know uh uh our challenges and uh our failures and our weakness that they are so imprinted on our mind that it's difficult to see another picture to even see how can we get out of this but look at the stars amen look at the stars look at the promises in this book just like Paul said we just read if God's paying that his his his uh uh on a beloved Son how much more will he and I give us all things are we together so you see expressing that uh exceeding faith we have to go beyond ourselves you have to look to the word amen even expressing exceeding Joy it is because of what the word has promised Hallelujah sometimes we look at our symptoms and the things that we're going through it's very difficult to rejoice our spirit is so battered and I mean just worrying and thinking about things on our mind but we have a lot of promises praise the Lord knowing very well that God knows that we will go through all of these things and that's the reason why he he's uh uh he gave us these promises just like the children of Israel God knew that the Giants will be in the land but he never mentioned the Giants he said the land is Flowing with milk and honey praise the Lord because what he wanted them to do is to go look for milk and honey not look for Giants go and look for milk and honey he knew that the Giants were there but when they got to the Guild of the city the first thing they saw they saw the Giants praise the Lord I said wow they even forgot that there was milk and honey they forgot that there was milk and honey it depends on what you are looking at what you are looking at will increase your faith if you are looking at God promises if you are taking God's word every morning to look for a promise love for a word that will edify your heart it's going to increase your faith give you strength even make you healthier praise the Lord but if you are looking at your next appointment with the doctor and the prescription and the Assad effects praise the Lord amen if you are looking at the next appointment with the doctor the prescription I got to change this matter I can deal with these side effects and and then when you go the next one they will give you the outside effects praise the Lord much more when you are looking at the news and everything that is happening since six years old taking gun and father putting his gun in the chart in a kindergarten backpack praise the lord it's enough to pull your children out of school praise the Lord amen Hallelujah amen glory be to God I am your great and your exceeding reward praise the Lord God was promising Abraham I will reward you with myself he's the father of faith the way that God there with the father of Faith that's the way he would deal with every Seed of Abraham he says I will reward you with myself I am your great and your exceeding reward are we together musicians you can come forth hmm now you see we we uh uh I was I was speaking this uh uh over in the UK uh sometime last year taking this same subject about exceeding reward in the city faith and uh uh we read this spoken word is the original see the Lord of reproduction bring forth of his kind this last day the truth Church Bride Comes to the hair Stone will be the Super Church man if you take that word super Church and he talks about the super Church a super race if you take that word and you just you just stick it in their sense or in that in a way that brother Brandon take it you would think that this message has come to start another race of people no better Brandon was just using the very same language that Paul is using here exceeding faith that's what that word super is praise the Lord he says there have been men Through the Ages they have tried to start some kind of a super race he said Hitler trying it never worked for him messaloon and try it never worked for him praise the Lord and you see people will just get honored they are taught you know we are the super race because you believe Malachi 4 because you believe God sent a prophet that's not what he was talking about [Music] is to allow the exceeding grace of God to be expressed through your life that when you realize that God was merciful to you you can be merciful to somebody else when you realize that by Grace you were safe you can give somebody else a chance but what have we done we have taken the sense that because we are the super race we condemn every other group of people that is only the only library in the Rapture you get the whole picture wrong [Music] it's a wrong picture you were looking at what he said wrong [Music] this last day troop Church bride when she comes to the headstone when she comes to the Hearthstone World The Mystery of God is revealed the intelligence of God has been released upon her it brings an exceeding understanding you get above legalism praise the Lord you get an exceeding understanding she will be a super Church a super race as the as the near the Great hairstone there will be much like him there will be much like him praise the Lord and who is he he's the word amen there will be much like him that would take all they would take themselves to the word they will look at themselves in the word the word will be in their desire they will meditate upon the world day and night [Music] that's the super race he was talking about people that we have exceeding Grace exceeding understanding they will have such a knowledge to be able to deal with things in such a complex age they are seating grace of God will not make you judgmenter praise the Lord no as we're getting there such a time we see politics is filling around us not even knowing which direction the government is going we can trust the system but we can look at the stars we can be like Abraham every morning we will come out and look at the stars praise the Lord even though he could not count everything but he tried to count and he count when he misses he said praise God I'm going to have children praise the Lord the next morning he come again or evening he comes and start counting he count and count he get confused you see every one of them he said praise the Lord I'm going to have children praise the Lord and that's how we do it when we look into God's word we look for his promises praise the Lord and when you read the promise of God you take comfort that he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you praise the Lord let's buy our house together foreign yes he took my place that I drew is love could take him so that I might become him by grace oh he oh he may give me so that I might become him by
