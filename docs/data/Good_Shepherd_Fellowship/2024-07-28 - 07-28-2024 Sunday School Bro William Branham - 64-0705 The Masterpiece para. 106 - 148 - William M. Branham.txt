========================================
[Music] for [Music] doar piled together but they didn't Sparkle even under the light and I said to the superintendent of the minds I said why don't they sparkle he said sir they haven't been cut yet they must be cut then when they are cut then they reflect the light there you are the Masterpiece must be cut notice cut for what is the piece cut off no no the piece is cut off is made of vrola needle and the victrola needle is put upon a a a record that's unseen music to the world but the needle is what brings it out brings out the true interpretation of the word his life match all the peoples it pleased God to Smite him and now why did he Smite him for the same cause he had to Smite Adam now we see him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted the perfect lamb for SL siners slain a perfect Masterpiece now for nearly 2,000 years God has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam to get a a piece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's a new testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and old is husband and wife and it taken the new to for the old to fores show the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything it's in the New Testament another masterpieces in making as it taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece and so doing it he does it by his never changing method the same way he made the Masterpiece amen his word that's the way he makes his masterpieces because it can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's a perfect word any dirt trash injections it'll break but the heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never break remember cutting a diamond you have to have a perfect tool to do it with not just any piece will do it I've seen tons of them big Grinders crash right through it and move them big tons over pass that diamond right on through oh you don't break the diamond has to be cut now he's doing the same thing and he never changing method we find out in Malachi 3 he said I'm God and I change not he cannot change his method now as he started in Abraham after the follow of the first Masterpiece he started in Abraham on the foundation to build another Masterpiece he started on the day of Pentecost to build another Masterpiece The Original Seed word start in the first church what was it the seed word the word manifested the promise that had been given Joel said it shall come to pass the last day sayth God I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old man shall dream dreams your young man shall see Visions what he would do in the last days to last 2,000 years notice and it's started out as the original as Jesus said the word of God is a seed that is sore sold and he was the soar the seed was the word and notice any seed that abides alone never does nothing it's got to fall into the ground to bring forth its production again and this seed that perfect Church fell to the ground at nasia Rome when she become a denomination now historians remember and you go to hear this tape check it up and find out that's not right the church died at n a Rome when she took dogmas and Creeds instead of the original word what was it God had showed by that first church that he was God God he had a church perfected but the church like all other seeds must fall into the ground and die now it fell into the ground and die and wasted away you know I read a book here not long ago someone wrote a a book and said the silent God you might have read it I forget I I think brumbach no I don't I'm not sure who it was wrote it but I can't remember I got it in my study the silent God said God to Thousand Years of Dark Ages set still and never moved a hand and watch faithful Martyrs go to the Lion's pit and be burnt by the Romans assassination of all kinds women stripped of their clothes Set Fire to the WR hair with tar and burn them remember short hair first began in Rome and the women of Christians had long hair so they they dipped it in tar and set them a fire and burn them and them naked B him to the lines and this writer goes to say where is that God oh the blindness of man sometimes do you not know that that seed had to die he never tried to deliver them they went down in Victory they went down bleeding and dying giving their lives why it was the seed that had to fall into the ground first John 12 tells us the corn of wheat it's got to fall into the ground and there die not only die but rot but little did that denomination know that that life was still in there oh the church in itself that n see a counsil of 15 days of bloody politician debate when them Aristocrats come in and want to inject these big dignitaries into the church and Prophets come out of that werness there eating herbs and wrapped in animal skins Janu and Prophets and they throw them out why the seeds got to fall into the ground it's got to die it died in the Dark Ages down beneath the dark dirt they thought it was gone you know St John 12:24 Jesus said except the corn of wheat falls into the ground it abides alone and the first church was that reproduction that bride that seed that word made manifest that fell into the ground at I see a Rome L Church throughout the Nations that'll hear this there is your dirt as them denominations there's where the word was crucified and they accepted dogma and for hundreds and hundreds of years of Dark Ages the power in manifestation of the word was hid from the world only Catholicism ruled we all know that as reading history only Catholicism rule but you you can't hide a gerti seed it's got to come forth because why the great sculpture is on the jobah go to build again so he the seed went down the word when we see Saint Paul Peter James John all those who wrote the word and the road they word they wrote become alive and lived and it lived and when we find after it begin to get ripe John began to write in Epistles he was thr on the aisle of after being burnt in AAL for 24 hours but the word must come forth has got to be wrote they couldn't borrow the holy ghost out of him with all so he come forth his work wasn't finished he died on not natural death poar which was a disciple of John carried the word on and from poar came irenius and irenius the great uh man of God who believe the very same gospel that we believe the word is right the church trying to squeeze it out finally come to n Rome and there she fell into the ground after St Martin and was murdered St Martin believed the same thing we believe he stood the same thing the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in water in Jesus name he stood in the very same thing that we do and he was a prophet Believe the full word of God and finally they were crucified and mashed into the ground and laid there for hundreds of years and until it rotted the outside seed the bodies just rotted away I've been in San Angelo and the catacombs and see where they died and there broken bones and everything they finally rotted till their bones were gone but the life was still there the corn of wheat that fell into the ground on at the Nia count so begin to sprout again in Martin Luther like any corn coming up or wheat at the seeds Rock the life Springs forth and it begin to bring forth and Martin Luther what did he do the first thing reject the denomination of Catholicism right protested that it was wrong where he said the just shall live by faith Lord what was it a little weak life it put up a couple little shoots that was Luthers it sure don't look like the green that went in the ground but the life is coming out now then it went on to a stock then what happened in the days of John Wesley what did he do when he brought out sanctification he stayed with the word and what did he do the Lutheran had organized and made an organization so it was time for something to happen the Masterpiece is being built now what did he do what did he do he protested that angle in church came out in the Reformation as a tossel what is it the seeds coming to life growing now now the stock doesn't look like the seed neither does the tossel now Pentecostal Brethren throughout the Nations I want you to listen my brother if this is the last message I'll ever preach this is my masterpiece do you notice when the Wheats the corn of wheat that falls into the ground when it begins to farm back to its its grain again what's nature nature exactly is God God working in nature it's all it can but from the Pentecostal Revival as they think was the seed it wasn't now watch but something come forth just like the seed watch what Jesus said in St Matthew 24:24 that the two Spirits at the last days would be so close together it would deceive the elected if possible now that stalk don't look nothing like a seed neither does a tossel look like a seed but notice now not in Luther's day but in the last day the first thing there sweet farmers stting here the first thing that comes forth on a wheat seed you would almost think it was a seed but what is it it's the husk it forms a little outside thing like to hold the seed it forms a husk but the husk is not the seed no more than the tosser of the stalk was it's only a carrier of the life the corn of wheat then of St John 12 you see Jesus speaking the wheat after the tossel after uh Wesley puts forth the husk which is the foremost like the grain of anything else the husk is more like the green it's coming more like the grain all time the one that went in the ground and when it comes forth the stock it's got life in it but it sure isn't the grain comes forth the tossel the pollen it still isn't the Grain and then it comes forth the husk and it's just in the shape of the wheat just exactly like the grain of wheat but yet it isn't the wheat just exactly in the same shape perfectly the Pentecost is come out just like the wheat would each one comes out from the other coming out from the other but they're only a carrier they go to denomination and that's what Pentecost did went to the denomination and what did Pentecost will do when it come out just like the graen it went right back like in Revelation 17 to one of the sister Den ations that's exactly what that's what Jesus said now what the gospel is going to come out through Luther through Wesley into Pentecost and the last days they'll receive the very elected if it's possible the elected oh Pentecostal Brethren can't you see the wheat in his first beginning is just like the seed when it begins to form like the seed but it's a husk it's denominated exactly done the same thing they did down here in Luther in Revelation 17 it proves the same thing of churches now the Green Seed in the original fell at Nia or it was the first denomination notice here the life that was in the stock tossled all now ends up in the seed the life that come out of the original seed come up through different processes three different processes and then turns back till its original condition hallelujah oh happiest person in the world that God has let me see this watch how perfect the word and these nature works together just like we Prov the resurrection rise the sun setting of the sun rising again the leaf going out of the tree down in the sap into the root and comes back up and and the leaf comes back up with it again it falls on the ground the life of the tree sucks it right back to calcium and poish and brings it right up to another Leaf again see all nature everything works right with with the word of God and here it is exactly perfectly in these Church ages that's the reason the Holy Ghost came down and draw those things and made them out for us the way he has it's exactly notice share the life that was in the husk in the stalk and in the tossel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself but what denominated dies like life and Luther went to make Wesley and and from Wesley it went to Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the original seed on to Pentecost comes out of the Wesley until that time the reason that Pentecost come out of Wesley because it was no denomination Pentecost was then Pentecost went to denominate and what did it do it turned to the husk it looked like the real thing and anybody how many ever seen a SE seed of wheat start to grow what's the first little thing it's just exact like the seed but it's a husk see the three stages stalk tsel or the pollen then the husk and then out of the husk Comes The Original Seed not a seed it was the life of the seed growing through this to come to the seed do you see it what is it a Resurrection coming back to a masterpiece again like the one that went inj Pentecost came out of the Wesley because Wesley was an organization Pentecost come out as no organization then turned to one it had to to make the husk the True Word of Life on it was on its way then to the original grain through these stages through the stalk then into the pollen from the pollen into the husk and from the husk it made seed no stalk tossel hus living they produced in their early Revival a holder of a certain potion of the seed line but when they organized the life moved out of it that's prove all history never an organization ever done a thing after organized it was dead that's right watch the life's traveling on now it's moving on notice what they have done all these have done As proved by history just exactly the way the church has come never to to be useful to him again organization is laid on the Shelf there never has been in all the history or church after it organized but what it died and the organization died and never did raise again can't you see it man who are blind open your eyes nature and the word coordinating together and proving it right here that this this is the truth that it is the truth that life leaves a stalk to make the tossle from the tossle it makes the husk and from the husk it goes into the original again notice never again to be useful to him how noticeable this life is in its travel in the corn of wheat than it is in the tree God called his people like a tree see the life goes down in a tree and comes back up again goes down and comes back up see it goes down and comes back up but in the corn of wheat it goes up from the original stalk to the stalk castle and husk and the thing that had passed through die so it can't get back to it again what is it it's no use anymore it goes on to its Perfection amen don't you see why he never used an organization he can't get back in it again it's dead but the life passes on from one to the other Hallelujah see they put Creeds in inject whosoever shall add one word or take one word out see he's blocked off from it it must be the life seed traveling on I'm using this in a parable now of the Bride the Masterpiece is coming forth as a masterpiece fell there's a masterpiece Rising the Masterpiece fell at pent I I see a Rome a ni after I I see a Rome she's come through a process but she's coming right back again that Masterpiece perfected because she's a part of that word that was spoken by him he'll have a church without spotter wrinkle Lord it'll not be connected anyway with any kind of an organization or denomination the cursed thing it's passed through those things but it'll never be there notice the seed is coming up not life is coming up not going back there will be no more Resurrection after this am the life is coming up to go to his Perfection a resurrection notice the husk put forth the uh the notice the husk puts the uh uh Original Seed out of itself in Revelations the thir chapter we find this now remember no other church was he put out of in the Bible of the seven Church ages how many remembers it he passed through the church age to go on to make something else but this is it there's nothing else but the the sculpture has got back to Perfection again the word see don't go back how different it is yes oh and notice then the husk when he comes forth looks just like the green but when the green life begins to leave the husk to go into make the green the bride the husb opens up and excommunicates to grain is that right nature that's exactly what she did in Ro in Revelations 3 we find out the lady see a church H put him out I see it didn't back in the other ages because there was something else yet to be made it just passed through and went on to another I've [Music]
