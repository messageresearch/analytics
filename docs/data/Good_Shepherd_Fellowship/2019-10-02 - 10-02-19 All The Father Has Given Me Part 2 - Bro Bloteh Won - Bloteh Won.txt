he's in the house dance had to flee now there is live darkness used to be now there is hope there's no more time praise His name [Music] he's in the house little girls lying there Oh little girl was lying there people all were we and they only laughed at Jesus when he said she's only sleeping but as he took her by the hand she began to labor again some began to praise the Lord yes some began to say he's in the house yes sir death passively amen now there is life with darkness used to be now there is hole there's no more time [Music] [Applause] haha so I was like that little group I was like that little girl [Music] Jesus my and it gave me life again I'm just the house of play ever since that last day there's a lot bad shine to me for all the world to see he's in the half death has the please now there is light with darkness [Music] now there is oh there's no more time crazy crazy [Music] [Applause] he's in the heart amen you may be seated just a minute I was listening to the sermon be certain of God on the way here and made me think of Jordan preached a sermon a long time ago and I always stuck with me you look at it and it's in the previous song was saying that you know here they are in the storm and Jesus is asleep in the boat and they didn't call on him they waited until they were like absolutely I'd like their width ed but he was always there the whole time the ship wasn't going down Jesus was in the boat right it wasn't going anywhere and so there's two different elements in that one they didn't call him him until his like the very end and then second if they'd had enough faith they wouldn't have even needed to call on him because they would have known he's in the boat he's in the house if the ship is not going down the same thing for us and God's really been dealing with it with me on this is that he's here he's with us he's in our hearts and in our lives and we do go through the valley of the shadow of death but we won't fear we can decide to not fear because we know he's with us and how do we know because he said he would be that's it that he would never leave us or forsake us period and that's it and there's such a rest in that and being certain of God that he is not a man that he should lie he can and he will live up to his word Amen you know I have ambitions I have desires I I say things that I want to achieve and I don't achieve them but God doesn't do that if God said it he meant it and he will make it so the author the finisher of our faith amen praise the Lord let's go ahead and stand and we'll sing brother one you can come why don't you turn into you open the eyes of the blind there's no like you like you Oh into the darkness you shine [Music] and out of the ashes we rise there's no one ooh like [Music] our God is

darkness you shine and out of the ashes we run there's no one you like you Oh our God is greater our God is stronger God you are higher than any other our God is healer awesome in power our God haha and if our God is for us then who could ever stop us and if our God is with us or what could stand against and if our God is for us then who could ever stop us and if our God is with us whoa what

place here we come tonight father any place you law to come any habit our praise we are so grateful Lord Almighty God we want to commit this time now into your hands a small UI years Lord God a healing not this building Lord gamba the hearts of your children Lord we want to ask so God just pulled us together tonight even the ones that are now with us so father we pray for British can and sister now me and brother Wesley and sister Karen Lord and the meaning that I now would first tonight we're been in his family but Ezekiel in this household as well even our traveling loved ones of God and but Andrews and sister Christian we commit him all in your hands tonight father we pray that God as we get into your word you will come out of the pages of God and speak to us we love you we appreciate you thank you for the some service thank you to God for your special blessing Lord what a wonderful father you are in Jesus name we pray amen baby praise the Lord the Lord bless you we'll remain standing let's just go right to the word thank you very long praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 1 services affair I never told you before I came up here I just sent up a quarter or two up there that I want to use for the service tonight hebrews chapter 1 let's just read from verse 1 God who at sundry times and in divers Milan speak in time past unto the father's by the prophets had in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed here's of all things by whom also he made the word is pray to get a father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless this portion of the word that we have just read part of calm now loading and break it to us tonight in Jesus name we pray amen Allah bless you may have you see praise the Lord as as many of you received from the text brother scat had to do cataract surgery today so we believe that he's recovering and we pray for a speedy recovery price of all Sunday that in title speaking on all that the father had given me but you know it is one of those things were you get affected by you know sometimes things people said or things you see and it just it just drive you you know drive your action drive things that you would say because of so then I started speaking on intellectual faith never even went into what I wanted to talk about all that the father has given and it just it just almost like I couldn't get get away from my mind or it just couldn't get away from me because I was maybe because of the trip that I made Saturday and with some other things that we have to talk with the brothers there in Wahpeton area may be bad that was what kind of all affected me a little bit and I admit yeah I can see that that brought me into death but looking at intellectual faith and as we we spoke a little bit Sunday and divine faith wishes divine revelation how I choose to to continue in this way so I would just take a little thought here tonight and let's just get it together believe in that logo for his blessing upon it praise the Lord so we will start with with this coat and we just use it for the service tonight as we started together christ is revealed in his own word now in order to study the scripture Paul told Timothy study it rightly dividing the word of God which is true amen Paul say rightly dividing the word of truth and I like the way brother Branham says you're rightly dividing the word of God which is truth he says them or there is three months in the scripture in using God's word there is three things that we must not do now the reason wider accountable fair a bit led to go into this just like I said seeing that we were speaking a little bit about intellectual faith I realized that now looking closely at this sometimes can be the reason why and it's mostly the reason why we find people going into intellectual faith good people you know the law of God but there is just this thing of the human nature sometimes we get answers amen we get answers and and we are serving a God and living God but yet he's he's a God that that is a spirit he is not in a couple body like our body that we can we can touch we can handle we can see visible with our eyes we are using the eyes of faith to see the God that we serve amen believing the promises in his word but yet we are in a falling body praise the Lord and this falling body has its fallen nature and one of the fallen nature of man is there we men are fed from that continuity with God he has a nature that he's anxious to get back to the place that he was before praise the Lord and that is the reason why when when we come across a promise in God's Word and and and that promise becomes real to us we want it now praise the Lord amen and and a man gives his heart to the Lord and and and and he and he realized all that God is doing for him and God gave the promise of giving of receiving the Holy Ghost and and and and and a new word to come in the rapture and the changing of our body you know our our immediate faith in God you know put us to the place where we get anxious we want to see this thing amen even our Lord Jesus we talks about him we talk about heaven we get anxious and we want to see it anxiousness it's a sense of the fall praise the Lord it's also that sense two shows that we we fell from somewhere and there is a desire in us to get back to where we fell from praise alone so sometimes with with the same suffer of anxiousness we return to find ourselves in this in these places where we will be looking at tonight as we as we started to get them they are three mass in the scripture in using God's Word there is three things that we must not do now let's study those for the next ten minutes well he might be 10 minutes mine would be more than 10 minutes tonight praise the Lord amen it might be 3 months or 10 months or the next 10 weeks three things that we must not do and all out in the land wherever you are across the nation be sure to put for this down in your mine if you haven't got a pencil you must not do these things we tell you all the time how how you must do now I'm going to tell you what you must now do now remember now brother branham say in using God's Word whether you are preaching it whether you are applying it to yourself you must not do these three things because sometimes we think is only the preachers that must not do this and and where where my drive is tonight is is to take it away from the preachers and apply it to our service of the time we do these things applying God promises to ourselves now you must net misinterpret the word that's the first thing because God's Word is of no private interpretation prays alone it is written in the word that we must now add we must now take away praise the Lord and now you can see a little bit word I talked about their sense of anxiousness as we go along you will see what what we are talking about well I believe it means this you know sometimes to suit ourselves sometimes you know to make ourself fit into the word it means just what it says praise the Lord God's word means just what it says it is no interpreter and you must never misplace the word he must not misinterpret we must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word those are the three months and we want to look at we want to look at them closely as in applying into ourselves now that one of the reason why year is that we we have to know they're in one dispensation God was above his people amen he was dream in the prophets and sending that the children of Israel prophets in and raising kings and judges and then another time God revealed himself in his son when God came in the form of a body and this time God is dealing with his people are we together so it's important for us to be able to look at this closely and as we apply it to ourselves because as I said in the word God word will not go out and return back back when God made a promise is surely going to come to pass praise the Lord it's surely going to come to pass so we just have to learn to be patient we have to learn to wait for God to fulfill his own word like the prophets said the vision will speak for itself even though Atari it would definitely come to pass are we together so we must not do these things we must not misinterpret the word we must not misplace the word we must net dislocate the word and if we we would do either of these it rolls the whole Bible in a confusion no it rules the person in the confusion it was the person that was there in a confusion they create a chaos praise the Lord amen the world will always mean what it is praise the Lord now if you bring it to the life of the individual and-and-and-and you will always be a son of God you will always be a daughter of God but if you are caught in this thing is going to put your life into a confusion because you're going to say well why is this happening to me why am i this way there is nothing wrong with the word it just what is happening is that the way you are processing the world are we together so it rolls the whole Bible in in a confusion to the person and in the chaos notice to miss interpret Jesus is this is an example now to misinterpret Jesus in the form of God in the man you will make him you make him one God out of three to misinterpret Jesus Christ being the word you will make him one God out of three all you will make him the second person in a Godhead noun so you you just see all the doctrines that have come out of the Godhead in the beginning when God said let us make man in our own image and people said well he was talking to the Trinity and the brother Trinity out of the other end and people have broader the teaching of Purusha out of the earth and all of the Aries is all because there is a misinterpretation somewhere are we together amen so to misinterpret that Jesus in the form of God in a man you make him a one-goal out of three order to misinterpret the word you make him one go three or you will make him the second person in a Godhead and to do that you will mess the whole scripture because if you get the Godhead wrong it will be difficult for you to relate to God because Jesus said in that day you will know that I am in the father the father in me I in you and you in me praise the Lord amen so you see the people that goes with the wrong interpretation of the word they're not just only getting the interpretation of the word wrong but is also affecting their relationship I mean if they gather the interpretation of the word that you have to pass through a scene or you have to pass through you know you have to act somebody to talk to the father on on your behalf if that is the way that the honest and the word is going to affect the our own relationship because they cannot go ball it to the truenicks they will always want to talk through somebody to God they will never want to they will never believe that God can be able to speak to them they will always want to hear from God through somebody praise Lord so that is the reason why we must not misinterpret the word I word on that a little bit here amen like brother Branham says here to misinterpret that word we either make a trinity out of it or the second person in the Godhead and to do that you're going to mess the whole structure up one time the zodiac was God's Bible praise the Lord and for the person you know to just to just prop because of what the way they see the heavens and and just guess you know if they will misinterpret the times in the season praise the Lord like those three wise men they saw the the constellation of the Stein's they brought them all the way down to Jerusalem to come and look for the birth of our Lord if you have not steady wisely you know any Naevia would not you if you just saw the starting and I guess there were many other you know stargazers that was looking in the heavens and they had their interpretation about it praise the Lord so we must not misinterpret the word let's dwell on this a little bit you didn't never get no word now only in understanding also in your relationship we've gone remember brother Branham says until he had the true revelation of the Godhead he always thought that Jesus loved him and the father was angry at him praise the Lord and people will come up with all of those kind of tricky teaching because in the India mind the thing that God is a man so it's better for you to talk to the Sun because the Sun knows how to apply to the father we are having that human mind that that kind of mind about God just follow me here a little bit this would get interesting you will get nowhere so you must not miss interpret and if you say there of certain thing you put an interpretation to it how many times we do that things happen in our life and we put an interpretation to way and sometimes when you do that you get stuck with it you get stuck with it because your mind has come to believe you your mind your mind is is your church member I mean your mind comes to believe you so you get stopped to dad until you tell your mind said no I was lying to you it's not really the truth how we together and if you say that a certain thing you put an interpretation on it and you apply it to another time where bantams taught us there he says you know always looking to what God would do now what God has done and not being able to identify what he's doing now are we together and you apply it to another time or is being applied to another time you also make an aim correct interpretation praise the Lord so we take that that makes interpreting the word and let's look at this all the code we'll come back to that let's look I show us the father I just put this one in and just to be able to help us get a better picture of what we're looking at tonight she was the father bourbon MCS here he says there's only one God and a different agree with the organization of Pentacles that's called the oneness like your finger is one now when we think about only one God we think about the number one we think about just like my fingers standing up yet put only one finger up I'm covering the rest praise the Lord now you have to think about it this way this God we are talking about one time fill all specs there was no time amen one time he feel every word this great internal spirit praise the Lord now so you see how how the hymn of mind all the teachings of man will want to narrow God down and just make him just a single one a small one two let's go ahead a little bit he said that's wrong absolutely it's wrong Jesus couldn't have been his own father because sometimes when you talk about the Godhead and we try to prove that there is not three gods there is nothing about the Trinity the word Trinity is not in the Bible we wait to throw that out there God is one what our mind goes to is that we are just looking at the number one and then for us to be able to prove our doctrine which says Jesus say I and the father are one are we together amen we get a Bible verse we can throw it out there sometimes out of these theological understanding in Bible believe they can just be a fit leaf to cover sometimes our ignorance oh yeah that's what I believe we've only believe in one God and we baptized in Jesus name in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that's the name of the one God the berm said Jesus couldn't have been his own father and if God is a man then Jesus was born sexual desire another virgin birth that's said to the whole thing you see if he's one like your finger one then what then he was his own daddy praise the Lord how cool how could he have been that's wrong he had a father Jesus did you just can't see the manifestation of God unfolding himself prays alone that is the great intent of spirit that is the God though that we watch it and it's like you know we come to church and says well let's let's pray less let's invite the Lord he was here before we even got here praise the Lord oh let's let's pray so the Lord came he was here before we even he said even before we open our mouth who knows exactly what we're going to say in all of these line of thought sometimes they affect our relationship with God because of the way we process him in our mind praise the Lord and I've been kind of for studying a little bit on the attribute of God like I said last time talking about it yeah a little bit sometimes when we talk about the attribute of God we like to make God's attribute substance even you've been an attribute of God his net you ask the person is that attribute of God the love of God that is projected towards you and the grace that is given for you to embrace that law amen so it's almost like I'd like to say in this child way it's almost like the little boy that take the board and he true in the air and run across the feet to receive it it is God on this side is God on the other side I mean it's God giving the promise he's God on the other side believing the promise it's God making the promises God on the other side bringing the promise to pass praise the Lord paul dierden in item as chapter 17 he got out there and he met all of these these men these Greeks you know man of wisdom and they had this big inscription there to the unknown God and he stained around those men you know he just he could just see the wisdom and they had they have been like that it's it's almost like brother Branham said and in Jesus day they heard about what he was doing and he came down wanted to see him price alone because in their mind of the things that they have heard the man that have raised up their demand I open the blind eyes the men have in their mind saying all of these things they have put an image to that man oho when we get down there the way he would be dressed amen and man I would do such a thing should be highly esteemed so they got right there Jesus I was right there and they wanted to see him are we together tonight so he he got down there and saw the inscription to the unknown God and realized that these people had a true desire with all the a wisdom and all the things they have such other belief that there is there is a supernatural intelligence somewhere and trying to approach him praise the Lord believing that he's he's far somewhere far away if he can hang the heavens up that the Sun can come you know and in the moon you know the weather changes you know what that's a great intelligence and now with all of these things that he has placed up there and to see all the things that is happening it looks like oh man God gave us this universe he gave us this word and man has become so evil and he have just driven God far away from his universe that's why we are suffering praise the Lord can you just think about all the chaos we are having if God was not paying attention we won't have a word to lady I mean who have a word to lady that's a brother branham saying the church age bow he says he says we make God so impersonal it looks like he just made us throw us down here and sitting on his throne looking down like he's watching the movie he says no but God is governing in the offense of man he's governing in our offense he never gave us a promise he never created word just left us here and gone away he's involved praise the Lord now when Adam sharing the pain in in the Garden of Eden there was never a you know a radio message that went to heaven there was not telephone call the only man I was there hear he's the one that have fallen in there he's he's hiding himself and the next thing that the scripture tells us God come down in the cool of the evening and he asked him Adam Adam where are you Oh again the the kanima who acts and thinking if God knows there why he will ask out of were you yeah because God knew where Adam was I don't never knew where he was praise the Lord I mean God knew where Adam was because it was all part of the plan because there was a plan of redemption and God knows where we are and he want to help us to realize where we are praise the Lord I don't never knew where he was but God knew where he were where Adam was took a fake leap hide himself no wonder Jesus come right down there he have to curse that fake tree over there in in the Book of Luke because the fig leaf had just been cursed right from the beginning men always run to Aidan then to hide himself verbanski that's what religion is are we together so you see library Balaam said he says you just can't see the manifestation of God unfolding himself a loving father you can make him one you can make him tool you can reduce him down to your understanding God keeps unfolding himself praise the Lord he keeps unfolding himself he is the creator of the universe the universe in itself cannot contain God the heavens of heavens cannot contain him he's bigger than this world he's greater than everything oh yeah he can unfold himself all for himself and Komondor in your heart amen and when he comes in your life then he starts unfolding himself we want to reduce God to doctrine to crease to Dogma to what our church believe when God is greater than the end praise the Lord you know just like I said I was there on Sunday about been in an airplane you get up there the aeroplane gets so high up you go beyond the class you can even see anything trailer are still driving on the street terms of vehicles are moving up and down men are working morning afternoon shift night shift but you are beyond the clouds and you can see nothing that is happening yet because of how far you have gone into the heavens and when you starts to be same you coming down and you start losing at it you altitude then you start coming to consciousness praise the Lord that come into consciousness and sometimes you sit there when it gets over Minneapolis you want to see whether it's eg and a blooming turn and you're looking down and you you know and you guessing maybe that is the Mall of America maybe this displays you you're trying to put a picture sometimes that's the way it is praise the Lord you think about God being a loving God you tell you about God being a holy God and you think about all of God's attributes like brother Branham says he says he says love was their purest fountain of God because God is love if the thing that flows out of God he says where every time he condescended to the earth it takes all these different form we have feel your love and you know and and he says every time it gets down to man it gets more perverted what am I saying this tonight is because sometimes the way our mind thinks about things our minds is it so easy to get stuck on things and then we put on interpretation to it but then you will realize as a son of God or the daughter of God that God has projected his attribute all and you have a seat of God in your heart you can understand what is going on and you taught really this was it I really thought that this was it I thought that you know I take for example I have the Holy Ghost let me let me share something with you trying to bring this thing out go to night a brother called me today good young brother trying to check on him in I haven't talked to him for a while and I call him and he returned my call and we were talking from one thing to another and then he says he said brother one I was thinking about something else I want to share with you how to dream he says an industry MIT was it was about the rapture he says it was you know it was it was about the rapture the Saints you know it's almost like we were in that period of the rapture he says and then and and and the Lord ascended he says and and you know all the Saints are the great resurrection he says and and there was something there happen and that's where I'm confused in the drain because in the drain it's like I was change of all the rapture in sins I was changed and the Saints were ascending to heaven but I was not going to heaven but I could feel that I was changed I can feel the effect of a change on me and when he was you know narrating or dear to me and then he says it was it was almost like in his dream our Lord Jesus is well somebody is missing it is right there he woke up from training assisting I started to think well but I knew in the dream I was changed well while I was on our rapture I joined I said where brother you know what I'm you know I don't have I can't interpret dreams but I will share this with you I said the rapture is a process in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the Lord himself shall descend with a shout that's the word of the hour when the shell comes and you identify the word and you identify the message of the day you you are caught up into that cycle of the rapture you have a rupturing word that is dealing with you I said was what we don't realize is that that's why the scripture says we are changed from glory to glory it's a constant process of change now just just thinking on what you said to me you had a sense when you think about the sleeping virgin they had claimed life what will produce that clean life but it didn't have everything they needed to respond to the midnight cry and we to get in so you said even God is dealing with our life he has put us on this wheel like he Zeke here and he's dealing with our life bringing us through all the stages of grace sometimes we come true and experience and you get so excited oh and you find the Lord and it's almost like you are on the housetop and everything you know what is looking brand-new and we put an interpretation to that instead of us keep believing the Lord and keep trusting the Lord and keep you know and enjoying the moment when God is dealing with our life let's enjoy the moment so when we get down in a time of trial we will also appreciate the moment we must not misinterpret the word what God is doing in our life is also a part of the word we are the rapture in people we are the people that the promise of this hour has come talk before I send you Elijah the Prophet we have received that promise it's part of the word so we cannot separate separate ourselves from the world we are part of the word Elijah or my Carmel he said to Israel after he gathered the stones he said I have done all of this I call into the world and let this be the very thing that would turn your heart back there's two right there the witness your witness the fire coming down from heaven consuming the sacrifice did the people automatically change no they then are the magnet turn instead of worshiping Jehovah so the what Elijah said was wrong no Elijah prophesied and was going to take a process of time there had to be an Elijah that would come in the picture they had to be a Jew that would that would destroy bar and jessabelle they have to be somebody that would throw Jesse beer down and it had to go to the bottle it was all part of the process it was all part of the process but if you stay right there and say Elijah said your hand would turn back and the people had never turned back so God fell God and now fulfill his word you have just put an interpretation D and misinterpreting the word what would it do it would confuse you so God is now with us God is now with us Elijah I just preached a message he said our heart was going to be turned back don't misinterpret the word don't be quite to put an interpretation to what God is doing in your life why because the story keeps on falling God keeps on falling he keeps on falling and the story is getting better amen it's getting better and as we pass the pages we're beginning to understand and we're beginning to see things more clearer and better than we did yesterday the scripture says we'll have ferry fryers why when it comes then we quickly to think that God don't love us praise the Lord God answer prayers and yes it's not the only answer God answer prayer and yes is not the only answer why when God said no he said God any answer your prayer it's because of we want to make him just like our finger we want to have this God that we can tell to do things and he do it and you did not dare not tell me praise the Lord that is that that is the reason why a divine faith received the word because he knows that God is there there is a God there is a creator I feel his love in my heart I feel him dealing with my heart I don't need to understand everything when we get our human mind into adding and and to see how you know yeah it's almost like one plus one equal to okay when I do this and and I do this the scripture says and repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I've repainted I was baptized but you know by that bad but by the more I know it's a preacher when we got down in the water I mean my body was shaking I felt on experience but then why is all of this happening it have to happen it's all part of the word if God is cleaning your life why shouldn't he show you some of the things that he's sticking out praise the Lord and we can look at the same image placing the word that's how that that have to do with timing I mean they have to do with timing just like we can uphold Moses into an ark I'll bring Noah to cross the Red Sea you'll all have to do with timing we have to know that what God he's the one that begins time he on he said on time God he understand time he understands seasons praise the Lord we can we can look right into the message and just stay with where brother Branham said don't misplace the word don't pornos are into into Moses edge but bring it to yourself bring it to yourself are we giving God time for him to be able to teach us and we gave in ourself time for us to be able to grow in the things that God is doing the things that he's revealing to us just like I said you know it's that the anxiousness is there and sometimes like you know sometimes like a preacher you feel it you you you get to the place word you you have an inspiration and the Lord is helping you to to see this thing instead of just saying right there instead II in a lot of God to unfold the thing for his word to you and even let the word deal with you we get so anxious ain't we get an inspiration we want to come and preach it and sometimes we can do a very good job of preaching this wonderful inspiration that is on our heart and yet and still we are never even got to the place that God want us to get because we're just all rolling right in the mind right in the mind like we have said before God could have created the entire universe one day it was not something that was difficult for him to do that he have to use six days to create he who have come aright there let there be letter B letter B letter just one letter B K who have created everything but God Himself gave himself time for his work to come out personally for it to be beautiful he gave himself time when he did the work on the first day he stepped back he stepped back and he located and he says it was good praise the Lord so we started this a little bit and but that's I just want to put you into that chain of Todd you think about misinterpreting the word if you are not called to be a preacher to go out and preach then you have no reason to preach the word you have no reason to be telling people things in the scripture when you know that you know you're not called to do it but what's about understanding the word almost like Zacharias in the temple an angel came down and told him that you are going to have a child he struggled believing what they injure said but yet it was not going to stop what God was going to do he couldn't process it through his mind with all the example that was in the scripture Abraham were fading or there is up what I was but he could not process it at that very time this was a preacher this was the man I was reading about Abraham Isaac when he came to his time he was struggling without word in his mind really let's bet is so old thank goodness that's all I thought we have passed this have you ever thought about that sometimes when you think I thought I have passed this in my walk why am i stay here why am I seeing you why is this happening to me I thought I should be fire pastor no you stay here on earth you are staying in the body of five senses praise the Lord you know they don't don't destroy the beautiful things that God is doing when he brings you by sometimes and allow you to see that I took you from here and I talk to you from here then you know and all of these things don't don't don't don't stop guarding and you know don't don't don't don't don't interpret what God is doing we're already if I was saved this would not happen to me what you saw that's one of the must that we must not do because God's Word is of no private interpretation and what God would do he never place it in the hands of enemy let's just wash the word keeps unfolding let's just allow God to do what he's doing let's become part of it let's just enjoy it like Paul says there is no trial in a pleasant time in the present time that is enjoyable but we have to be there we have to be there we have to stand with him praise the Lord that's the three months that we must not do praise the Lord we must not those dislocate the word we must now put it in the future amen you find people most especially young people do there you know I would get out you know and then when when I get married and I will be serious don't worry in the future be serious now don't try to the future what if the Lord can bring me through this then you know I will be on fire get on fire right now you might get through a quicker praise the Lord just get on fire now say Lord just just put me on fire let me get through this quicker don't wait to get true and before you get on fire God is now setting his word as I in dealing with you by looking at his word know when God was about to deal with the earth he spoke to the earth so if God is dealing with us he's using this word to deal with us he's speaking the word into our life and into our cetera situation so we must not miss interpreted by saying oh no it is not for me no it is for these people if you believe that God is dealing with you you can say every promise in the book is mine I mean you can say every promise in the book be around to me I call into that word that was what Mary said praise the Lord they ain't gonna talk about she will be conceived and she will be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost but she was going to be despised she was going to be rejected she was going to be cast out praise the Lord and she was going to witness his precious gift being nailed to the cross let's bow our heads tonight not only in situation will we get excited over here answers to see good things coming or even sometimes when we going through trials it could be sickness it could be a financial problem or it could just be God dealing with us to bring us through a habit sometimes who would like to take a religious approach well I feel that the Lord is dealing with my heart I'm I'm going too fast and parading I'm you know I'm just gonna spend some time with the Lord and you know believe in thinking that we will impress God with this thing and God you would get the trial would will go very quickly no the trial comes to build character in our life their prophet of God said God is here and reveal in simplicity and like I said before if we can see God if we can be looking for him and trying to see God in the situation that is happening around our life we give us faith for us to trust him like job would say even if you slave me I would state trust you he could now understand what is happening but he knew that God was in control he knew that there was a God he knew that everything that was happening was net with other knowledge of the God that he have kept a true integrity before in a way if God would just raise us up to their faith raise us up to that attitude not trying to understand everything but just believe that he's in control that he's in the house because trying to understand and put in an interpretation to it it would just be an intellectual faith an intellectual faith can go so far but will not be able to kill us all the way don't misinterpret what God is doing we're Branham says because the promise delay several hundred years after Isaiah said the virgin shall conceive so the pod also saw spiritual interpretation today Israel is the virgin Jerusalem is the Virgin Zion is the virgin who bring forth and they put all this interpretation to it and when God brought his word to pass in a humble simple way they never saw it because of their own interpretation falling in love with Jesus for any long wave jeez [Music] falling in love with Jesus that's the best thing that I ever done yeah falling in love with Jesus falling in love wedgie falling in love with Jesus that's the best thing that I ever heard Brennan evey talk to us spoke to us preachers he said you can study the word just like Paul require us to steady he said but there is one thing that we advise you to do fall in love 40-love for something to give his secret to Delilah she had a fall in love with him and that sometimes that's that's how we understand what God is doing in our life let's love him let's lobby with all of our heart out of our mind even if we can't understand it or fill your mind with the thought that God is a good God just fill your mind with the thought that he's a loving God and think about the things that he have done for you in your life just allow those stuffs to flow through your mind the Lord I know you are a loving God I know that you are a healer I know you are a strained Giver just love him with all of your heart out of your mind of your strength the little one that is left give it over to him I love because He first loved me and [Applause] [Music] chase my Oh [Music] yes ah I love he I love he because he first loved me and he / kiss my yeah [Music] all things let's just not sing it let's feel it from our house tonight let's feed him from our hostel night better ban him taught us now deported period allow God to bring his word to pass for the interpretation of the word is when God bring it to pass your father all you said in your word now your spoken word is of no proper interpretation father we can get to the Bible and we can get and read a cold slaughter brother branham in and all of that Lord but we realize for God using that very word to deal with our life and how many times of God we have come shot of misinterpreting what you are doing in our lives and like the Prophet said when we do that we throw ourselves into confusion we create chaos around our life and sometimes we make wrong choices and sometimes we do things that we should not do we hurt ourselves because I said son of God I said daughter of God there is a seed in us and after the wine will realize that we misinterpret that word because it's not going to leave it's not because of what the Baptist says it does not it does not change the Bible the Bible remains the Word of God and that is the same sometimes when we misinterpret things we put our own interpretation and and and it does not change us from being a son of God or the daughter of God it just throws us into a moment of confusion Lord why this is not happening in my life I believe you I've been rolling to your worldwide business not happening brother Branham says just stay in the word and Seymour keeps unfolding and Seymour keeps unfolding job when true way and his letter end he saw more on 40 help us Lord help us father and we were not misinterpret Lord your word that has come to us your word that is dealing with us we will not misinterpret it for Lord in your word you said you have predestinated us before the foundation of the world no action of our life is going to change that in your word you say you have caught us onto adoption no action of our life is going to stop us from getting there you promised to give us the Holy Ghost to give us the spirit of truth that will guide us and lead us into every truth that's what the Spirit of Truth is promised to do sometimes when we turn from there just like Eve listening to a lie but yet God a bigger picture a bigger on falling of your great Redemption plan was brought to us help us lord help us father that we will not misplace your words we will not look for what you are doing in the future let's look for it now we love you Father we appreciate you Lord dear Lord we also pray tonight at your grace will be with dear brothers and sisters that are not with us Lord we commit them into your hands remember the different needs of God Father amana's law and we want to thank you Father God for the different victory you've been giving to us of God we appreciate you Father Lord in the way we see your movie in our maze Oh God let us not look for you a fire for God for Porto those people at Mass Hill for in you remove we live and we have our being you are not father Branham says when they will come to realize you have been here all the time you've been there all the time we love you Jesus Pepa so God made this real to our heart father made this real Lord if Adam knew that he will come running to you the very moment he failed he would not go hiding from you what affected him was his thought process in the same thing affecting us Lord commit ourself in your hands now come and go with us Oh God Jesus you wanna Amy the Lord bless you thank you for bearing with me tonight praise the Lord let's just stand on our feeding and send a song here and be

than your top process they're just things standing on the promises tonight there now understand on that for on those promises let's walk on it and go home tonight amen and if you get home I will tell
