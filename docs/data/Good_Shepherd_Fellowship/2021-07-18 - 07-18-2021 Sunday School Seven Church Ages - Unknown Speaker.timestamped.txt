[0:11] the original manuscripts were written in
[0:13] the aramaic
[0:14] which was the language of jesus and the
[0:16] people of his day
[0:17] it is claimed by them that the people
[0:19] did not speak and write in the greek as
[0:21] is so commonly supposed
[0:24] and the fact is our historians are
[0:25] divided on that
[0:27] for example dr schoenfield a most
[0:29] brilliant student has from research
[0:31] proved to his satisfaction that the new
[0:33] testament was written in the vernacular
[0:35] of the greek speaking people of that day
[0:37] he builds up a fine case for his beliefs
[0:39] based on the various documents at his
[0:41] disposal
[0:42] but on the other hand we have another
[0:44] renowned student dr lomsa
[0:46] who is convinced that the new testament
[0:48] was written in the aramaic
[0:50] and he has none other than the brilliant
[0:51] historian toynbee to back up his
[0:53] contention that the aramaic and not the
[0:55] greek
[0:56] was the language of the people so it
[0:58] seems possible that the new testament
[1:00] was first written in the aramaic
[1:02] however before we get too concerned
[1:04] about this let us read both the king
[1:06] james version and the translation by dr
[1:08] lomsa
[1:10] to our gratification we find the words
[1:12] in both amazingly the same
[1:13] so that there is no difference actually
[1:15] in content or doctrine
[1:17] we may even conclude that god has
[1:19] allowed these newly discovered
[1:20] manuscripts and recent publications
[1:23] of already known scripts to come before
[1:25] us to prove the authenticity of what we
[1:27] already had
[1:29] and we find that though translators may
[1:31] fight each other scripts do not
[1:34] now you can see that you can't base
[1:36] interpretation upon students profound
[1:38] knowledge of the language the bible is
[1:39] written in
[1:40] but if you still can't see that because
[1:42] you are veiled in your mind by tradition
[1:45] here is one last illustration no one can
[1:48] doubt
[1:49] but what the scribes and pharisees and
[1:50] the great scholars of the year 33 a
[1:53] knew the exact laws of grammar and the
[1:55] exact meanings of the words in which the
[1:57] old testament was written
[1:59] but for all their superb knowledge they
[2:01] missed the revelation of god's promised
[2:03] word manifested in the sun
[2:05] there he was set forth from genesis to
[2:07] malachi
[2:08] with whole chapters devoted to him and
[2:10] his ministry and yet except for a few
[2:13] who were illuminated by the spirit they
[2:14] missed him entirely
[2:17] we now come to a conclusion such
[2:19] conclusion as we have already found in
[2:21] the word
[2:22] as much as we believe in trying to find
[2:24] the oldest and best manuscripts to get
[2:26] the best record of the word possible
[2:28] we will never get the true meaning of it
[2:30] by study and comparison of scriptures
[2:32] sincere as we may be it will take a
[2:36] revelation from god to bring it out
[2:38] that is exactly what paul said which
[2:41] things we also speak
[2:43] not in words which man's wisdom teacheth
[2:46] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[2:48] first corinthians 2 15.
[2:51] the true revelation is god interpreting
[2:53] his own word by vindicating what is
[2:55] promised
[2:57] now don't let anyone be misled by what i
[2:59] have said and think that i do not
[3:01] believe in the accuracy of the word as
[3:02] we now have it
[3:04] i believe this bible is accurate jesus
[3:07] completely authenticated the old
[3:08] testament when here on earth
[3:10] and it was compiled exactly as was our
[3:12] new testament
[3:13] make no mistake about it we have the
[3:15] infallible word of god today and no
[3:18] man dares take from it or add to it but
[3:20] we need the same spirit that gave it to
[3:23] teach it to us
[3:24] oh how we need revelation by the spirit
[3:27] we don't need a new bible we don't need
[3:29] a new translation
[3:30] though some are very good and i am not
[3:32] against them but we need the revelation
[3:35] of the spirit
[3:36] and thank god we can have what we need
[3:38] for god wants to reveal his word to us
[3:40] by his spirit
[3:42] may god begin by his spirit to give us
[3:45] continuous life-giving and prevailing
[3:46] revelation
[3:48] oh if the church could only get a fresh
[3:50] revelation and become by it the living
[3:52] word manifested
[3:53] we would do the greater works and
[3:55] glorify god our father
[3:56] in heaven loosed from sin
[4:01] revelation 1 5 unto him that loved us
[4:05] and washed us from our sins in his own
[4:07] blood
[4:08] the word washed is actually loosed
[4:11] loosed us from our sins in his own blood
[4:14] isn't that wonderful but are you
[4:16] spiritual minded
[4:18] did you catch it it was his own blood
[4:20] that loosed us completely from our sins
[4:23] it was not human blood it was the blood
[4:26] of god
[4:27] peter called it the blood of christ paul
[4:30] called it the blood of the lord and the
[4:31] blood of jesus
[4:33] not three persons but one person there
[4:36] is that revelation again
[4:37] one god that omnipotent jehovah god came
[4:40] down and made himself a body
[4:42] by means of the virgin birth and
[4:44] indwelted that it might be the blood of
[4:47] god that would free us
[4:48] loose us entirely from our sins and
[4:50] present a spotless before himself with
[4:53] exceeding great joy
[4:55] would you like an old testament type let
[4:58] us go back to the garden of eden
[5:00] when the first news came to glory that
[5:02] the son adam had been lost
[5:04] did god send an angel did he send a son
[5:07] did he send another one like unto us no
[5:10] he came himself to redeem that lost son
[5:13] hallelujah god did not entrust his plan
[5:16] of salvation to another
[5:17] he trusted only himself god was made
[5:20] flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed us
[5:23] unto himself
[5:24] we are saved by the blood of god the
[5:27] eternal god
[5:28] indwelt a mortal body in order to take
[5:29] away sin
[5:31] he became the lamb in order to shed his
[5:33] blood and enter into the veil with it
[5:36] consider this since it is the blood of
[5:39] god it is perfect blood
[5:41] and if the perfect blood is loosing us
[5:43] from the power and bondage and
[5:45] defilement of sin
[5:46] then the losing is perfect and complete
[5:49] there is now therefore no condemnation
[5:52] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[5:54] god's elect
[5:55] it is god that justifieth declares us
[5:58] righteous
[5:59] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[6:01] that died
[6:03] romans 8 33-34 there it is
[6:07] his death gave us the blood the blood
[6:09] has loosed us
[6:10] there is now no condemnation how can
[6:13] there be
[6:14] there is nothing to be condemned for
[6:16] because the blood has loosed us from sin
[6:19] we are free guiltless don't listen to
[6:22] man
[6:22] listen to the word you are loosed by the
[6:25] blood
[6:27] now don't get tied down again by
[6:28] traditions and creeds and organizations
[6:31] don't be led astray by listening to
[6:33] those that deny the power of the word
[6:35] and deny that jesus saves
[6:37] heals fills with the holy ghost and
[6:39] power
[6:41] you are god's free man loosed by his own
[6:43] blood
[6:44] if you still hold your faith to creeds
[6:46] and denominations
[6:47] it is certain by the evidence that you
[6:49] have lost your faith in the word
[6:53] kings and priests revelation
[6:56] 1 6 and he hath made us kings and
[7:00] priests unto god and his father
[7:02] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[7:05] ever
[7:05] amen he hath made us
[7:09] oh there are certain truths we need to
[7:11] emphasize this is one of them
[7:13] he he have made us salvation is his
[7:17] doing
[7:18] salvation is of the lord all of grace
[7:21] he redeemed us for a purpose he bought
[7:24] us for a purpose
[7:25] we are kings spiritual kings oh we are
[7:29] going to be kings upon the earth with
[7:30] him when he sits on his throne
[7:33] but now we are spiritual kings and we
[7:35] reign over a spiritual kingdom
[7:37] it says in romans 5 17
[7:40] for if by one man's offense death
[7:42] reigned by one
[7:44] much more they which receive abundance
[7:46] of grace and of the gift of
[7:47] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[7:50] jesus christ and in colossians 1
[7:54] 13 who hath delivered us from the power
[7:57] of darkness and has translated us into
[7:59] the kingdom
[7:59] reign of his dear son right now we reign
[8:03] with christ having dominion over sin
[8:06] the world the flesh and the devil
[8:08] showing forth his praise and glory
[8:10] showing forth himself for it is christ
[8:13] in us
[8:13] willing and doing of his good pleasure
[8:16] yes indeed even now we are seated in
[8:18] heavenly places in christ jesus
[8:22] and made us priests yes priests unto him
[8:26] offering the spiritual praise of
[8:27] sanctified blips
[8:29] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[8:31] unto him
[8:32] worshiping him in spirit and in truth
[8:35] interceding and petitioning
[8:37] priests and kings unto our god no wonder
[8:40] the world does not appeal to us and we
[8:42] are a peculiar people zealous unto good
[8:44] works
[8:45] we have been recreated in him to be
[8:47] children like unto our father
[8:50] the coming god revelation 1
[8:53] 7 behold he cometh with clouds
[8:56] and every eye shall see him and they
[8:59] also which pierced him
[9:01] and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
[9:03] because of him
[9:04] even so amen he is coming
[9:08] jesus is coming god is coming the
[9:11] prophet is coming
[9:12] the priest and king is coming be all in
[9:16] all is coming even so lord jesus come
[9:19] quickly
[9:20] amen he is coming
[9:23] he is coming in clouds clouds of glory
[9:26] as when he was seen upon the mount of
[9:27] transfiguration
[9:29] and his garments were shining as the
[9:31] power of god unfolded him
[9:33] and every eye shall see him that means
[9:36] this is not the rapture
[9:38] this is when he comes to take over his
[9:40] rightful place as world ruler
[9:42] this is when those who have pierced him
[9:44] with their creeds and denominational
[9:46] doctrines shall mourn
[9:48] and all the people shall wail in terror
[9:50] because of him who is the word
[9:53] this is the revelation story of
[9:54] zechariah 12
[9:56] 9-14 zechariah prophesied this about
[10:00] 2500 years ago
[10:02] it is just about to take place listen
[10:05] and it shall come to pass in that day
[10:07] that i will seek to destroy all the
[10:09] nations that come against jerusalem
[10:11] and i will pour upon the house of david
[10:13] and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem
[10:16] the spirit of grace and of supplications
[10:18] and they shall look upon me whom they
[10:20] have pierced
[10:22] now when is the gospel returning to the
[10:24] jews when the day of the gentiles is
[10:27] finished
[10:28] the gospel is ready to go back to the
[10:30] jews oh if i could just tell you
[10:32] something that is about to happen right
[10:34] in this
[10:34] our day this great thing that is about
[10:37] to happen will carry over to revelation
[10:39] 11
[10:40] and pick up those two witnesses those
[10:42] two prophets
[10:43] moses and elijah turning the gospel back
[10:46] to the jews
[10:47] we're ready for it everything is in
[10:49] order
[10:50] as the jews brought the message to the
[10:52] gentiles even so the gentiles will take
[10:54] it right back to the jews and the
[10:56] rapture will come
[10:58] now remember what we have read in
[11:00] revelation and zechariah
[11:02] both come right after the tribulation
[11:04] the church of the firstborn does not go
[11:06] through the tribulation
[11:07] we know that the bible teaches that
[11:11] at that time it says that god is going
[11:13] to pour out his spirit upon the house of
[11:15] israel
[11:16] it is the same spirit that was poured
[11:17] upon the gentiles in their day
[11:20] and they shall look upon me whom they
[11:22] have pierced and they shall mourn for
[11:24] him as one mourneth for his only son
[11:27] and they shall be in bitterness for him
[11:29] as one that is in bitterness for his
[11:30] firstborn
[11:32] in that day shall there be a great
[11:34] morning in jerusalem as the mourning of
[11:35] hadadrimon in the valley of magiddon
[11:38] and the land shall mourn every family
[11:40] apart the family
[11:42] of the house of david apart and their
[11:44] wives apart
[11:45] the family of the house of nathan apart
[11:47] and their wives apart
[11:49] and each one of the houses apart when he
[11:51] comes in clouds of glory at his second
[11:53] coming
[11:55] those jews that pierced him shall see
[11:56] him as it says in another scripture
[11:59] whence did you get those wounds and
[12:01] he'll say
[12:02] in the house of my friends not only will
[12:05] it be a mournful time for the jews who
[12:07] rejected him as messiah
[12:09] but it will be a mournful time for those
[12:11] left of the gentiles who have rejected
[12:12] him as the savior of this day
[12:15] there will be weeping and wailing the
[12:17] sleeping virgins will be wailing
[12:20] they represent the church that refuse to
[12:21] get oil symbol of the holy spirit
[12:24] in their lamps symbol of the body or
[12:26] holder of the oil
[12:27] until it was too late it wasn't that
[12:30] they were not good people
[12:32] they were virgins and that signifies a
[12:34] high moral order
[12:35] but they didn't have oil in their lamps
[12:37] so they were cast out where there was
[12:39] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[12:42] let us type this all out in genesis
[12:44] chapter 45
[12:45] where joseph meets his brethren in egypt
[12:47] and reveals himself to them
[12:50] genesis 45 1-7
[12:53] then joseph could not refrain himself
[12:55] before all them that stood by him
[12:57] and he cried cause every man to go out
[12:59] from me
[13:01] and there stood no man with him while
[13:02] joseph made himself known unto his
[13:04] brethren
[13:05] and he wept aloud and the egyptians and
[13:08] the house of pharaoh heard
[13:10] and joseph said unto his brethren i am
[13:12] joseph doth my father yet live
[13:15] and his brethren could not answer him
[13:17] for they were troubled at his presence
[13:20] and joseph said unto his brethren come
[13:22] near to me i pray you
[13:24] and they came near and he said i am
[13:27] joseph your brother whom ye sold into
[13:29] egypt
[13:30] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[13:32] with yourselves
[13:34] that ye sold me hither for god did send
[13:36] me before you to preserve life
[13:38] for these two years hath the famine been
[13:40] in the land
[13:42] and yet there are five years into which
[13:44] there shall neither be earring nor
[13:45] harvest
[13:46] and god sent me before you to preserve
[13:48] your posterity in the earth
[13:50] and to save your lives by a great
[13:52] deliverance
[13:54] now doesn't that compare with zechariah
[13:55] 12 just beautifully
[13:57] putting the two together we are bound to
[13:59] get it exactly right
[14:02] when joseph was very young he was hated
[14:04] by his brethren
[14:05] why was he hated by his brethren it was
[14:08] because he was spiritual
[14:09] he couldn't help seeing those visions
[14:11] nor could he help dreaming dreams and
[14:13] interpreting
[14:14] that was in him he could not display
[14:16] anything else but what was in him
[14:18] therefore when his brothers hated him it
[14:20] was without cause
[14:22] but he was the beloved of his father his
[14:24] father was a prophet
[14:26] and understood that makes a perfect type
[14:28] of christ
[14:30] god the father loved the son but the
[14:32] brethren scribes and pharisees
[14:35] hated him because he could heal the sick
[14:37] do miracles and foretell the future
[14:39] see visions and interpret them that was
[14:42] no reason to hate him but
[14:44] they did and like joseph's brethren they
[14:46] hated him without a cause
[14:49] now remember how those sons of jacob
[14:51] treated joseph
[14:52] they cast him into a pit they took his
[14:55] coat of many colors that his father had
[14:56] given him and dipped it in
[14:58] blood to make his father think that the
[14:59] boy was killed by some animal
[15:01] they sold him to some slave traders who
[15:04] took him into egypt and there he was
[15:05] resold to a general
[15:07] the general's wife had him falsely
[15:09] imprisoned but after some time his
[15:11] ability as a prophet brought him to the
[15:13] attention of pharaoh
[15:14] and he was exalted to the right hand of
[15:16] pharaoh with such authority
[15:18] that none could approach pharaoh unless
[15:20] he came first through joseph
[15:22] now let us examine the life of joseph
[15:24] while he was in egypt for it is here we
[15:26] see him as the perfect type of christ
[15:29] while in the house of the general he was
[15:30] falsely accused
[15:32] punished and imprisoned without a cause
[15:34] just like they did to jesus
[15:37] there in prison he interpreted the dream
[15:39] of the butler and baker who were also
[15:41] prisoners with him
[15:42] the butler was restored to life but the
[15:44] other condemned to death
[15:46] christ was imprisoned on the cross
[15:48] forsaken by god and man
[15:50] on either side of him was a thief one
[15:53] died
[15:54] spiritually but the other was granted
[15:55] life and notice when jesus was taken off
[15:58] the cross he was exalted into heaven and
[16:00] now
[16:01] sits at the right hand of the great
[16:02] spirit of jehovah
[16:04] and no man can come to god except by him
[16:07] there is one mediator between god and
[16:10] men and he is all you need
[16:12] there are no mary's or saints just jesus
[16:16] keeping on with this type we find in
[16:18] joseph notice how that everything he did
[16:21] in egypt prospered
[16:22] his first job with the general prospered
[16:25] even the jail prospered
[16:27] when jesus returns the desert will
[16:29] blossom as a rose
[16:31] he is the son of prosperity as no
[16:34] age ever prospered as the one under
[16:35] joseph so there is a time of such
[16:38] blessing coming on this earth
[16:39] as the world has never known we can
[16:42] every one of us sit under our own fig
[16:44] tree and laugh and rejoice and live
[16:46] forever in his presence
[16:48] in his presence is fullness of joy and
[16:51] on his right hand there are pleasures
[16:52] forevermore
[16:54] praise god now notice that everywhere
[16:58] joseph went they sounded a trumpet to
[17:00] announce his arrival
[17:01] the people would scream bow the knee to
[17:04] joseph
[17:05] no matter what a man was doing when that
[17:07] trumpet sounded he bowed the knee
[17:09] he could have been selling something in
[17:10] the street just reaching out for his
[17:12] money
[17:13] but he had to stop and bend the knee
[17:15] when that trumpet blew
[17:17] if he were even a performer or an actor
[17:19] he would have to stop his act and bow
[17:21] the knee to joseph when his presence was
[17:23] announced with that trumpet call
[17:25] and one of these days everything in time
[17:27] will stand still when the trumpet of god
[17:29] shall sound
[17:30] and the dead in christ shall rise and
[17:33] mourning will break eternal bright and
[17:34] fair
[17:36] everything will bow the knee then for it
[17:39] is written
[17:40] wherefore god also hath highly exalted
[17:42] him and given him a name which is above
[17:45] every name but at the name of jesus
[17:47] every knee should bow of things in
[17:49] heaven and things in earth
[17:51] and things under the earth and that
[17:53] every tongue should confess that
[17:55] jesus christ is lord to the glory of god
[17:58] the father
[18:00] philippians 2 9-11
[18:03] but notice another glorious revelation
[18:05] in this typing of joseph
[18:07] joseph while in egypt was given a
[18:09] gentile bride and through her
[18:11] he received a family of two sons ephraim
[18:14] and manasseh
[18:15] joseph asked his father to bless the two
[18:17] boys he placed them in front of jacob so
[18:20] that manasseh the firstborn would be on
[18:22] jacob's right
[18:23] and ephraim to the left as jacob was
[18:26] about to bless them he crossed his hand
[18:28] so that the right hand fell upon the
[18:29] younger
[18:30] joseph cried out not so father this is
[18:33] the firstborn to your right
[18:35] but jacob said god crossed my hands
[18:39] here in type we see that the blessing
[18:41] which belonged to the firstborn
[18:42] the jew was given over to the younger
[18:45] the gentile
[18:46] through the cross crossed hands of the
[18:48] lord jesus christ
[18:50] the blessing comes through the cross
[18:52] galatians 3
[18:54] 13-14 christ hath redeemed us from the
[18:57] curse of the law
[18:58] being made a curse for us for it is
[19:01] written cursed is everyone that hangeth
[19:03] on a tree
[19:04] that the blessing of abraham might come
[19:06] on the gentiles through jesus christ
[19:08] that we might receive the promise of the
[19:10] spirit through faith
[19:12] the blessing of abraham came through the
[19:14] cross to the gentiles
[19:16] the jews rejected the cross therefore
[19:18] jesus got the gentile bride
[19:22] now getting back to the story of joseph
[19:24] meeting his brethren
[19:25] you recall that not all the brethren
[19:27] came joseph knew that and
[19:29] insisted that all the brethren appear
[19:31] before him or he could not make himself
[19:33] known unto them
[19:35] finally they brought the one that was
[19:36] missing little benjamin
[19:39] it was little benjamin the full brother
[19:41] of joseph that set his soul
[19:42] on fire and when our joseph even jesus
[19:45] will come to the people who have kept
[19:47] the commandments of god and who have
[19:48] gone back to palestine
[19:50] his soul will be set on fire little
[19:53] benjamin typifies the 144 000 israelites
[19:57] from all over the earth
[19:58] who have gone back to palestine for
[20:00] their redemption
[20:01] they will be standing there ready to
[20:03] receive him whom to know a right is life
[20:06] eternal
[20:07] they will say this is our god for whom
[20:09] we have waited
[20:11] then they will see him whom they have
[20:13] pierced and they will cry out in dismay
[20:16] where did these awful wounds come from
[20:18] how did it happen
[20:20] and they will wail and cry every family
[20:22] apart
[20:23] everyone apart in the agony of sorrow
[20:27] now where will the gentile church be
[20:29] while jesus is making himself known to
[20:31] his brethren
[20:32] remember that the bride of joseph with
[20:34] the two children were in the palace
[20:36] for joseph had commanded let everyone
[20:38] leave me
[20:40] put them all out from before me so the
[20:43] gentile bride was hidden in the palace
[20:44] of joseph
[20:46] where will the gentile church go in the
[20:48] rapture
[20:49] into the palace the bride will be taken
[20:51] off the earth
[20:53] she will be caught up before the great
[20:54] tribulation to meet her lord in the air
[20:57] for three and one half years while the
[20:59] retributive wrath of god is poured out
[21:01] she will be in the great marriage supper
[21:03] of the lamb
[21:05] then will he return leaving his bride in
[21:07] his father's house
[21:09] while he makes himself known to his
[21:10] brethren
[21:12] at this very time the antichrist
[21:14] covenant that the jews have made
[21:16] with rome will be broken rome and her
[21:18] allies
[21:19] then send their troops to destroy all
[21:21] the god-fearing word abiding jews
[21:24] but as they come against the city to
[21:25] destroy it there will appear in the
[21:27] heavens the sign of the coming of the
[21:29] son of man
[21:30] with his mighty armies to destroy them
[21:32] who have been destroying the earth
[21:34] with the enemy repulsed jesus then comes
[21:37] and presents himself to the 144 thousand
[21:40] having seen his mighty acts of salvation
[21:43] they have come to know his power
[21:45] but also seeing his wounds and knowing
[21:47] that they had rejected him even to that
[21:49] moment
[21:50] causes them to cry out in the agony of
[21:52] terror and fear
[21:53] even as did their brethren of old when
[21:55] they stood before joseph
[21:57] being sore afraid that they would be
[21:59] killed but as joseph said
[22:02] don't be angry with yourselves it is all
[22:04] right
[22:05] god was in it all he did it to preserve
[22:08] life
[22:09] even so will jesus speak peace and love
[22:11] to them
[22:14] why did the jews reject jesus god was in
[22:17] it all
[22:18] it was the only way that he could bring
[22:20] out the gentile bride
[22:22] he died on the cross to preserve the
[22:24] life of the gentile church
[22:27] now these one hundred forty four
[22:29] thousand are not in the bride
[22:31] in revelation fourteen four they are
[22:34] called virgins and they follow the lamb
[22:36] whether so ever he goeth
[22:38] the fact that they have not defiled
[22:39] themselves with women shows that they
[22:41] are eunuchs
[22:42] matthew 19 12. the eunuchs were the
[22:45] keepers of the bridal chambers
[22:47] they were attendants notice that they do
[22:50] not sit in the throne but are before the
[22:52] throne
[22:53] no they are not in the bride but will be
[22:55] in the glorious millennial reign
[22:58] we then see that when these last of
[23:00] israel have been joined in love to the
[23:01] lord
[23:02] and the enemy has been destroyed god
[23:04] will prepare his holy mountain
[23:06] his new garden of eden for the bride and
[23:09] his and her attendants
[23:10] for the thousand-year honeymoon upon the
[23:12] earth
[23:13] as adam and eve were in the garden and
[23:15] did not finish out the thousand years
[23:17] now jesus our last adam and his eve true
[23:21] church will fulfill all the plan of god
[23:25] oh how the bible repeats itself the
[23:28] scene of joseph and his brethren is
[23:29] about to be repeated
[23:31] for jesus is coming soon and as we leave
[23:34] the type of joseph there is one
[23:36] more thing i want to bring to your
[23:37] attention about this end time
[23:40] you recall that as joseph stood before
[23:42] his brethren when benjamin was not with
[23:44] them
[23:44] he spoke through an interpreter though
[23:46] he knew the hebrew well
[23:48] he spoke to his brethren in another
[23:50] tongue did you know that the first
[23:52] gentile age
[23:53] the head of gold babylonian age went out
[23:56] with a message in tongues written on a
[23:58] wall
[23:59] this age is going out the same way the
[24:02] abundance of tongues in this day is a
[24:04] further proof
[24:05] that the times of the gentiles is over
[24:07] and god is turning back to israel
[24:09] he is coming soon the alpha and omega
[24:12] the prophet priest and king be all in
[24:16] all
[24:16] lord god of hosts is coming soon
[24:20] even so lord jesus the one and only true
[24:22] god
[24:23] come quickly chapter 2
[24:27] the patmos vision revelation 1
[24:30] 9-20 john on patmos
[24:35] revelation 1 9 i john who also am your
[24:39] brother and companion in tribulation
[24:41] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[24:43] christ was in the aisle that is called
[24:45] patmos for the word of god
[24:47] and for the testimony of jesus christ
[24:50] this series of visions of the revelation
[24:52] of the person of jesus christ
[24:54] was given to john while he was banished
[24:56] to the isle of patmos
[24:58] this small island is 30 miles off the
[24:59] coast of asia minor in the aegean sea
[25:02] being rocky and infested with snakes
[25:04] lizards and scorpions
[25:06] it had little commercial value so it was
[25:08] used by the roman empire for a penal
[25:10] colony where were housed the more
[25:12] desperate criminals
[25:13] political prisoners etcetera you will
[25:16] notice that john has addressed himself
[25:18] to the christians
[25:19] as a brother in tribulation it was at
[25:22] this time that the early church was
[25:24] going through great persecutions
[25:26] their religion was not only everywhere
[25:28] spoken against
[25:29] but the people themselves were
[25:31] imprisoned and killed
[25:32] john like multitudes of others was now
[25:34] suffering imprisonment for the word of
[25:36] god and the testimony of jesus christ
[25:39] when arrested they tried in vain to kill
[25:41] him by boiling him in oil for 24 hours
[25:44] the enraged and powerless officials then
[25:47] sentenced him to patmos as a witch
[25:49] but god was with him and he was spared
[25:51] to leave the island and return to
[25:53] ephesus where he again continued his
[25:54] pastor until the time of his death
[25:58] the visions that john received covered a
[26:00] period of two years
[26:01] a.d 95 through 96.
[26:04] they are the most remarkable of all
[26:06] visions in the word
[26:07] the entire book is set forth in symbols
[26:09] and therefore is the target of much
[26:11] criticism and dispute
[26:13] however it does have the seal of god
[26:15] upon it
[26:16] that makes it authentic and of
[26:17] tremendous value to all who read or
[26:19] listen to its sacred pages
[26:22] in the spirit on the lord's day
[26:25] revelation 1
[26:26] 10 i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[26:30] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[26:32] a trumpet
[26:33] i was in the spirit isn't that just
[26:36] beautiful
[26:37] my i love that you could just call those
[26:40] words
[26:41] the whole of the christian life if we
[26:44] are going to live as christians we have
[26:45] to be in his spirit
[26:47] john was not talking about being in his
[26:50] own spirit
[26:51] that would not have brought these
[26:52] visions it had to be the spirit of god
[26:55] it has to be the spirit of god with us
[26:57] too or all our efforts are in vain
[27:00] paul said i will pray in the spirit i
[27:02] will sing in the spirit i will live in
[27:04] the spirit
[27:06] if there is anything good that will come
[27:07] to me it has to be revealed by the
[27:10] spirit
[27:10] confirmed by the word and made manifest
[27:12] by the results it bears
[27:14] as surely as john needed to be in the
[27:16] spirit to receive these tremendous
[27:18] revelations fresh from jesus
[27:20] we need to be in the spirit to
[27:21] understand the revelations that god has
[27:23] given to us
[27:24] to live by in his word for it is the
[27:27] same spirit
[27:29] look at it this way all too many read
[27:31] the bible where it says in acts 2 38
[27:34] repent and be baptized every one of you
[27:36] in the name of jesus christ for the
[27:38] remission of sins
[27:39] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[27:41] holy ghost and just pass right on
[27:44] they don't see it if they saw it by
[27:47] getting in the spirit they would know
[27:48] that if they want to receive the holy
[27:50] spirit
[27:51] they need to repent and be baptized in
[27:53] the name of the lord jesus
[27:55] and then god would be duty bound to
[27:56] fulfill his word by filling them with
[27:58] the holy ghost
[28:00] they never get in his spirit or it would
[28:02] happen to them exactly as the word says
[28:04] pray to god for a revelation by his
[28:06] spirit that is the first step
[28:09] get in the spirit let me just use
[28:12] another illustration
[28:13] suppose you need healing what does the
[28:16] word say
[28:17] well we have all read it countless times
[28:19] but did not get in the spirit when
[28:21] reading it
[28:22] did we ask god for his spirit to teach
[28:24] us the real truth of it
[28:25] if we did we would call the elders
[28:28] confess our sins be anointed and prayed
[28:30] for and that would be that
[28:32] it might not come immediately but in his
[28:34] spirit it is all over
[28:35] there is no other court of appeal god
[28:38] will fulfill his word
[28:40] oh we need to get in the spirit and then
[28:42] things will be done
[28:43] don't go through the acts first get in
[28:46] the spirit and then go through the acts
[28:47] and watch what god will do
[28:50] have you ever noticed how the world gets
[28:52] into the spirit of things that are in
[28:54] the world
[28:55] they go to their ball games their
[28:56] sporting events and their dances
[28:58] they enter into the spirit of it they
[29:00] don't sit there like wall flowers old
[29:02] dried up sticks
[29:04] they enter right into the feel of things
[29:05] and become a part of things
[29:07] but oh how they hate the christians for
[29:09] getting into the spirit of god's word
[29:12] they call us fanatics and holy rollers
[29:14] there is nothing they won't do to show
[29:16] their hatred and disapproval
[29:18] but ignore that you can expect it
[29:20] knowing where it is coming from
[29:22] just go on and get in the spirit of
[29:24] worship
[29:25] our spirit is clean it is fresh it is
[29:28] real
[29:29] it is sober and serious but nonetheless
[29:31] full of the joy of the lord
[29:33] the christian ought to be just as
[29:35] exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[29:36] the lord
[29:37] as the world is when it savors and
[29:39] delights in its pleasures
[29:41] both christians and the world are human
[29:43] both have emotions
[29:45] the difference is the christians hearts
[29:46] and emotions are purely on the lord of
[29:48] glory and his love
[29:50] while the world satisfies the flesh
[29:54] now it says that john was in the spirit
[29:55] on the lord's day
[30:08] [Music]
[30:34] so
[30:37] [Music]
[30:48] my
[30:53] [Music]
[31:09] you
