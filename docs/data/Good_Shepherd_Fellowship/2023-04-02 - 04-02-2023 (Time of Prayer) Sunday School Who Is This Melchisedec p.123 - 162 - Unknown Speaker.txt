TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign he come in three names of a son the son of man Son of God the son of David when he was shared on Earth he was a man to fulfill the scripture Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like an unto me so he had to come as a prophet he didn't never say I am the Son of God he said I am the son of man do you believe the son of man because that's what he had to testify of because that's what he was now he's come in another son's name Son of God the Unseen the spirit and when he comes again he's son of David is set up on his throne now when he would share and was made flesh he was called the son of man now how did he make himself known to the world as son of man the prophet one day as told a story of Peter and Andrew's brother they were fishermen and their father Jonas was a great old believer one day he said he sat down on the side of the boat he said Sons you know how we prayed when we needed fish there's commercial fishermen he said we've trusted god Jehovah or our living now I'm getting old now I can't stay with you boys much longer and I've always as all True Believers have looked for the time when that Messiah will come we've got all kinds of forces but there's coming a real one someday and he said when this Messiah comes I don't want you boys to be deceived this Messiah will not be just a theologian he will be a prophet for our Prophet Moses of who we follow he said now any Jew will be these Prophet he's taught to know that you know if the prophet says anything it's so then that's truth but God said if there be one among you spiritual or Prophet how the Lord will make myself known to him and what he says comes to pass and hear him in theory but if it don't then don't fear him at all see so that was a the Vindication of the prophet so Moses was truly a Vindicated prophet and he said the Lord your God shall raise up among you out of your brethren a prophet likened to me and all it won't hear him will be cut off from the people he said now children remember that is Hebrews We Believe God's Vindicated prophets now listen close don't miss it and he said when the Messiah comes you'll know him for he will be a prophet Messiah I said it's been 400 years we haven't had a prophet since Malachi but he'll be one day after his death a few years his son Andrew was strolling along down the bank and he heard a wild man out of the Wilderness saying that messiah's standing among you now that big eagle it raised up over the Wilderness and flew over there said the messiah's among you right now we don't know him yet but he's standing among you I don't know him because I see a sign coming from heaven one day he said there behold is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world away with the witness man to find his brother said Simon I want you to come over here we've done found the Messiah oh go on Andrew you know better than that all I know but that this man is different where is he where'd he come from Jesus of Nazareth that little Wicked City well he couldn't come from a wicked dirty place like that you just come and see finally persuade him to come down one day so when you come in the front of this Messiah Jesus standing there speaking to the people when he walked up in front of me said your name is Simon and you are the son of Jonas that did it he got the keys to the kingdom why he know that that man did not know him and how did he know him and that by the old fatherhood taught him how to believe the Messiah there was a man standing there by the name of Philip oh he got really excited he knows another man had been studying the Bible with a way he went around the hill and he found him out there in his uh Olive Grove he was kneeling down praying that had lots of Bible lessons together so he'd come out there and he said and you've got to pray he said um come see who we found Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph he's the Messiah we're looking for it now I can hear Nathaniel say now Philip you ain't went off on the deep end are you oh no no now let me tell you you know we've been studying the Bible together and what did the prophet say the Messiah would be and be a prophet you remember that old Fishman you bought the fish from it didn't have enough education to sign his name call Simon yep he come up and you know what this Jesus of Nazareth told him that his name was Simon changed his name to Peter which is little Stone and told him who his daddy was well they said he said I don't know could anything good come out of Nazareth he said let's not talk about it just come on and see that's a good idea Come and sing so here come Philip bringing up Nathaniel and but he got walking up Jesus probably standing speaking probably praying for the sick of the prayer line and when he come up to where Jesus was Jesus looked around at him and said behold an Israelite in whom there's no God now you say well his ways dressed oh no all easterners dressed the same he could have been a Syrian or been anything else beard garment he said behold in Israelite and whom there's no God and otherwise an honest sincere man well that kind of deflated Nathaniel And he said Rabbi which means teacher Rabbi when did you ever know me how did you know I was a Jew how did you know I was honest no God he said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you David 15 miles away the other side of the country the day before what did he say rabba or the son of God you are the king of Israel there should those priests there self-style self-starts said this man is beelzeba of a fortune teller Jesus said I'll forgive you remember they never said it out loud but they said it in their hearts and he perceived their thoughts that's right it's what the Bible says call it telepathy if you want to but he he perceived their thoughts and he said I forgive you for that but someday the Holy Ghost is going to come and do the same thing Andrew he's going speak a word against it will never be forgiven in this world of world will come is that right oh that were Jews then one day he had need to go to Samaria but just before we do that we found the woman or the the man as he went through the gate called Beautiful that he was healed and Jesus not his condition and told him take up your bed and go on home and he did it he got well then we find out the Jews some of them received him some believe it some didn't why did they believe it it was not ordained to lie it wasn't part of that attribute I remember them were a priest and great man and Jesus think of those theologians and Priests man that you couldn't find a flaw in their life Jesus said you are of your father the devil and his words you do said if you'd be of God you'd believe me if you can't believe me be Don't Believe The Works that I do they testify who I am now the Bible said that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus said the works that I do shall he that believeth on me do also is that right notice that was the real Melchizedek now notice again there was only three races of people you heard me say I was a segregationist I am all Christians or segregations that's segregation of color but segregation of spirit a man's color of his skin has nothing to do with him he's a child of God by birth but a Christian God said separate me come out from among them and so forth he is a segregationist a filth between right and wrong but notice they had a segregation and a racial segregation which was the Samaritans and there's only three races of people on the Earth if we believe the Bible that is ham sham and japer's people that's the three sons of Noah we all sprung from there right that makes us all back from Adam which makes us all Brothers the Bible said of one blood God created All Nations we're all Brothers to the bloodstream a colored man to give a white man a blood transfusion or vice versa now a white man can give the Japanese Yellowman or the Indian the red man or what more or whatever he could give him a blood transfusion cause we're all the same blood the color of her skin where we live had nothing to do with it but when we're segregating it's when we come out of the world like he brought Israel up out of Egypt that's when we're segregated from the things of the world now there was a ham sandwich people and if we had time to run the genealogies back you could see the Anglo-Saxon where he come from now that was that you the Samaritan which was packed you and Gentile that married in with the Gentiles at balaams Dunes and Moab they were Samaritans and there was Jews and Gentiles now we angle Saxon had nothing to do with any of it we didn't believe in him a sign or nothing else we wasn't looking for one amen we were brought in afterwards Jesus came to his own and his own received enough and he said to his disciples don't go in the way of the Gentiles but go rather to the lost sheep of Israel and he went only to the lost sheep of Israel and watch he manifested himself as son of man before the Jews they turned it down now the Samaritan being half Jew and Gentile they believed also and was looking for a messiah we wasn't we were heathens with clubs on her back worshiping Idols the Gentiles but now one day Saint John 4 he had need to go by Samaria on his road down to Jericho but was went up around Samaria and while he was going up there he sat down on the whale outside of a city called Sidecar and the will if you've ever been there it's a little panoramic not like this year it is a public sprang hair of water where they all come into women come over morning get their pots of water and put it on their head and one on each ship and walk with it just as straight as can be never spill a drop talk to one another so they were their people come out there so this is about 11 o'clock today so he sent his disciples into the city to buy some biddles boom and while they were gone there was a woman which was ill-famed oh we'd call her today a red light woman or prostitute she had too many husbands so while Jesus is sitting there this woman come out about 11 o'clock see she couldn't come with the virgins when they come in the mornings you get their wash water she had to wait till they all they didn't mix like to do now she was marked so then she'd come out to get some water so she just took the old window and put the hooks over the jar and started to let it down she heard somebody say woman bring me a drink now remember this is Melchizedek this is Jesus yesterday the son of man and she looked around and she saw a Jew so she said uh sir it's not proper for a Jew to ask the Samaritan for anything I'm a woman of Samara so you have spoken out of your place you should have asked me such a thing as that we have no dealings with one another he said but if you knew who was talking to you you'd ask me for a drink she said are you going to draw it the whales didn't you have nothing to draw with he said the water I give is Water of Life springing up in the eternal life he talked to her until he found what her condition was and then thought watch what he said to her now go get your husband and come here and she said I have no husband he said you've said the truth for you've had five and the one you now are living with is not yours so in this you said the truth what's the difference between that woman and that bunch of priests she know more about God and that whole bunch of priests did put together she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet she said we haven't had one for 400 years now we know that the Messiah is coming and when the Messiah comes that's what he's going to do that was a sign of the Messiah for he was the son of man amen said that's what he's going to do when he comes you must be his prophet he said I am he nobody else could say that she dropped that water pot and run into the City and said come see a man who told me what I'd done isn't this the very Messiah now remember he promised to do that same thing at the end of the Gentile race the Jews had had four thousand years to look for that Messiah 4 000 years of teaching he was coming and what he would do when he got there and they failed a scene or fail to recognize it and when he made himself known in the very Bible terms that he said he would when he'd been a theophany and then become flesh and dwelt among them they failed to sin and called his works the works of the devil now we've had 2 000 years of teaching coming down to the Roman Catholic church and to the apostles then we come down to the Roman Catholic the Greek and so forth on down to Luther's age and Wesley what more 900 different organizations coming down had all these ages teaching now he promised just before the end time would come that this picture of Sodom and Gomorrah would again as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the end time the son of man will reveal himself again yet a little while and the world won't see me no more yet a personal pronoun I will be with you even in you to the consummation the end of the world I'll be with you he's the same yesterday today and forever you see you see the Samaritan was actually from my last night's sermon was agar see a perverted type the Jew was staring up or was saronite but the Gentile is of Mary the Royal Sea Abraham's Royal seat now it's promised that in these last days that this same God the same Christ would come back here and reveal himself as son of man why he's the same yesterday and forever and if he let those Jews go by with and give them that Messiah sign and then come to the end of the Gentiles teaching and let them this going on theology he would be unjust he's got to do the same thing because the Bible said in third Hebrews 13 8 he is the same and he's promised in Malachi 4 and all the different scriptures that the last days the church would be setting just exactly like it is today and the world would be look at the world today look at the Sovereign condition look at the earthquakes and diverse places and the things has taken place look at the church in the message in a Babylon look at the messenger to it on Oral Roberts and a Billy Graham g-r-a-h-a-m first time we ever had a messenger to all the churches that his hat name ever end in ham like Abraham a b-r-a-h-a-m is seven letters g-r-a-h-a-m is six letters where's he at to the world six is man's number Man was created on the sixth eight but seven is God's number amen now look at them down there and slaughter them and there is their Messengers down there speaking to him amen amen but then where's that Royal seat of Abraham [Music] where is their sign that he said I said wow that God came down and was manifested in human flesh and told what Sarah was thinking back in her heart in a tent behind him the last sign before the Gentile world was destroyed by fire Hallelujah and the church has got its last time before the whole world is going to be destroyed this Gentile Kingdom be destroyed by the firing wrath of God you believe that that Melchizedek was flashing represent himself in a human body and then later he was made flesh and now tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever do you believe it who is this Melchizedek then that's his name yesterday I've never had no father never had no mother he never had no beginning of days he never had any in the life and he met Abraham and what kind of sign did he perform then when he was made flesh he said it would repeat again just before the end time you believe that I believe it let's pray [Music] [Music]
