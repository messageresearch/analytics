[Applause] [Music] praise the lord amen the lord bless you you can have your seed it's good to be in the house of the lord praise the lord we want to thank the lord for all his wonderful blessing brother hillary you are welcome back from liberia and uh we want to thank god for uh a successful home garden of your mom it's good to have brother andrews and sister christian back in church praise the lord and [Music] i think it was sometime in a week that sister ann marie told me they lost one of the uh loved ones back home i think it's one of their grain uh parent to grain aunt or so and uh it was i think it was a kind of a southern side situation i think it was a either the grand uncle that got a text didn't even look at it before i came up here i came up here then it came on my mind and the acts that we keep the family in prayer that the grace of god will be able to to strengthen and praise the lord amen this morning now before we go into the preaching of the world we have a little need we want to bring to the lord uh yesterday the uh sister titi told me no for need and for some reason she's uh started losing her head and it's just falling off so she asked that we prayed for her so i said well okay we will take it i said she asked me to pray for her so i said okay we take it as a church need so i thought that we mentioned any service this morning and sister titty you're coming and because the scripture says we know what the head of a woman represents to the church and represent to the family so he asked that we pray for her let's just buy our house together you know i was listening to brother branham talking about the woman i came before him before the lord jesus while he was at simon house brother branham said that she identified the word [Music] and she went into simon house that's part of a situation the prophet of god said it's on tape that when she fell at his feet and said oh how are they treating my lord like that it didn't even work on him didn't even wash his feet brother branham says god allow her tears glance to break enough tears for her to wash jesus feet and god allow her hair to grow for it to be enough that's what he said [Music] because we identify and need of the word so we're not coming because it's a need of our sister it's a need of the word because the word warned the sisters to treasure their head heavenly father lord jesus could have prayed in our closet i could have prayed with her last night lord but we bring this before the church of the living god and father we are uniting our simple faith oh god that you will come lord and honor your word precious lord whatever is the cause lord father we don't know lord jesus but father we know you know and we are bringing her knee to you father lord she won [Music] her head to stop breaking and stop cutting and father she won a new growth lord we should be a sign of a new life lord so god we just pray father that you will bless your daughter lord god honor her faith lord jesus and honor the faith of the church of the living god this morning lord we thank you we praise you we appreciate your father in jesus name we pray amen [Music] sweet [Music] sweet testing on the [Music] dog sweet [Music] praise the lord the lord bless you thank you musicians that will be all for the singing amen if we don't find a china to preach then we will call you back so we can sing amen praise the lord psalm 91 come let us think out loud to the lord let's raise a joyful shout to the rock of our salvation we are thankful to god for his healing touch and victory over the enemy praise the lord and for safe travel back home thanks to the saints for bearing us in prayer god bless you richly dear brother andrews and sister christian amen praise the lord amen amen and i also spoke to [Music] the young brother that started coming back to church brother glenn uh he too is recovering and spoke to brother wesley yesterday sister carol was down in her blood pressure but she's doing much better praise the lord so we want to thank the lord for that amen we want to thank the lord for that and thank the lord that we can be back in the house of god again amen praise the lord because if it is left to the devil he don't want us to be yet amen he don't want us to be back here but we want to thank god for giving us the privilege that we can come and fellowship around the world now and i've i've kind of forgot myself into a junction word uh really been asking all through the night where to go this morning i wanted to talk on the return of the pillow of fire and uh [Music] to be able to address something but uh uh i thought i first had on my mind i was going to speak on revelation chapter five and uh to to uh to talk on the mediator uh uh uh a week uh i can't remember i think a week ago uh brother abraham myself was talking he asked me the question there on revelation chapter five identifying the the lion and the lamb we know that is one actor but where where when is he the lion and when is he the lamb as it is as it is played out there and uh uh so we were talking about it and then you know it's it's just kind of a conversation that leaves impression on your mind and you say i look at that beforehand and i think let me go and do a review and then you get stuck in it praise the lord and and so i got i got a beautiful picture that i wanted to to bring out this morning but uh [Music] then i had on my mind that i was going to speak on the return of the pillow of fire uh because we we realized that uh we have uh the the scientific proof of the pillar of fire which is the picture that was taking over the head of brother branham that is the scientific proof of the pillar of fire which of course this is the only age that has got that scientific proof but this is not the only age where the pillar of fire came praise the lord this age is the age that got the pillow of fire and even since that picture was taken before that picture was taking the pillow of fire was here after that picture was taking the pillow of fire remains here amen praise the lord and and and that's what i thought i was going to go into so i just been asking the lord i said father just draw me through the channel that you want me to go through amen because sometimes as a preacher you find a china you know that you are in that channel nothing can pull you out sometimes you you having you have a few different channels before you say which one should i go into praise the lord so that's where i am this morning so you have to help pull me into one amen praise the lord i might i might be going all over the place but again uh wednesday night we spoke on uh uh revelation chapter 16 uh where we we took a taught that we uh we we tied to the unveiling of the three unclean spirit and [Music] i wanted to read this to you not to confuse you or not to put questions in your mind but also to show you the progression of the ministry of jesus christ in our day the progression of brother branham ministry and also to show you uh uh that you we that's that's what that's what we have to watch that's what we are following is that progression of the ministry praise the lord so uh brother branham said this and and actually when i when i checked on taped i found that there was there were three places where he he made this phrase he said this on 1952 july 13 in the morning and he also repeated it in the evening while praying he said o jehovah you who come and is standing down in the form of the pillar of fire praise the lord as the word can see it is in soul they see it there it is scientifically proven the church believe it god you speak each night and vindicate it to be vindicated the truth truly we are not much in this world we we look down upon we are looked down upon but god we believe we have accepted christ jesus and he in return has given us the holy ghost we love him that great third person of the trinity who burns through our heart and we love him can we say amen to the word if it is the word say amen to it praise the lord uh that's what i said i didn't read it to confuse you but i wanted to show you the progression of the ministry because this is the ministry of jesus christ amen it has progressed and it still progresses until we go over to the rapture and over to the millennium and then over to internet we will keep learning more of him praise the lord and in all the the the uh three quotes that brother branham mentioned this which of course i have them right before me but uh i was actually looking at this when i was planning to i mean preparing to speak on uh the return of the pillar of fire and in three of them he he mentioned uh uh you know you will standing in our midst in the form of the pillow of fire and then he gets he gets down to death the the second one is almost the same they tell one to my opinion the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel for any bible reader in here knows that that was the angel of the covenant which is which was jesus christ that's right and he was made flesh and dwelt among us said i came from god i returned back to god is that right i returned back to god watch the old testament christian or the new testament christian sorry how he lived poor vision he was he was started one uh one way got between the street in a vision come over to macedonia out here on the c-14 days and night no more no styes all hope all hope now where am i now okay all hope of uh ever being saved is gone and the angel of the lord come to him said don't fear paul you must be brought before caesar how little paul and the ship still rocking water loading log water log and everything shake in in his little hand like that and streaming be of good courage for the injured of the lords too by me this night and told me wherefore i believe god sir it will be just as what show means see the same jesus christ while paul looking upon someone preaching i perceive that you have faith to be healed ananias and and and repeated ananias and so far come true a big lie takes up peter being uh the spirit of the holy ghost on him he rebuked their sin and told and told them what they have done you see this practically the same thing the same thing night by night the holy spirit revealing surely now what he's typing here is that the same uh holy spirit that called ananias and so far out was the same spirit that was discerning the needs of the people in the meeting oh aren't you happy why we should be the most happiest people in the world that we are christian living in this dear friend don't look for anything greater praise the lord i think i'm completely reading something different than what i should be reading praise the lord yeah completely reading something different than what i should be reading to you i see why i can get there okay it was actually supposed to be dull to the heart 1958. he says uh you know what's the matter with the church it's been so cold till they have got a spiritual call and it would take more than congress to open your eyes it will take the lord of the holy spirit and the power of the resurrection of christ to take the coldness away from the church and open their eyes that they might see the presence of the lord jesus let him open your eyes he is the holy spirit the third person of the trinity here tonight to greece up your eyes with god save open your eyes praise the lord now so uh uh you know that would bring me into uh my mind uh the little story that i'll show you i mean i'll share with you wednesday night of that old preacher that trained his hearse to move on hallelujah and stop on amen you know uh it brings us to the place where you see this uh sometimes in the word and in the message it kind of stands out as is that a contradiction or what it is you know it's just like jesus said going into the word and preach the gospel you know teaching them baptizing them in the name of the father and and of the son and of the holy ghost i mean it's in the word it's in the scripture praise the lord now what uh uh makes it uh uh a contradiction is uh the way that it is interpreted praise the lord the way it is interpreted and the way that also sometimes is used now what am i saying uh i goes to say is that there are many group that claims uh uh even the jesus name group verb brandon baptism uh of the holy ghost uh the meeting that he preached between the the trinity hearings and and and the oneness trying to show that the trinity hearings were were having the wrong uh interpretation wrong understanding and even the oneness we're having even though they were baptizing in jesus name they were but for the fact that they were thinking that you know uh god is one in a sense of just just one as my one finger is standing up uh he he says that they were also going on with a wrong interpretation praise the lord amen so it is not uh i mean it is not uh how accurate that we say things praise the lord because you could read this and just think directly here that i mean brother branham is is is preaching the trinity taught i mean it is almost like uh uh like we said in the message and and and and being advised by the prophet to say what the tip says but many times you could say what the tape says and don't say what the prophet said you can see what the tips say and never say what the prophet said because we have to understand the progression that's what matters god moves amen and that is the same way he deals with us he wants us to grow we don't get saved and and then we just be static in in our i i said i believe the message and so that's all no he want us to grow praise the lord and which of course we have seen that i'm not going to go into uh i'm not going to go into a lot of those things but uh it's it's just at the place where uh you know uh is is uh well we have to pay attention let me just say that way amen we have to pay attention praise the lord so the lord bless you this morning in uh less than on our feet exeter chapter 13. i'll i'm just i'm going to trust the lord this morning as we have always done trust him and uh and have him help us praise the lord i know many of you that studied the message you're going to take note of that and you're going to go home and put up your coach and uh and says well i want to make sure that brother won't say what the prophet said and he didn't put his own thing up there amen exodus chapter 13 let's read verse 21 21 and 22 exodus 13 let's read verse 21 and 22 and then we can ask the lord's help and the lord went before them but the lord went before them by day in the pillow of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in the pillow of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillow of cloud by day none the pillow of fire by night from before the people verse 22 he took not away the pillow of cloud by day and on the pillow of fire by night from before the people let us pray heavenly father lord i will just bring our house before you father lord i don't believe oh god your children came or law to hear him or discuss lord father or just the thought of a man father we have come to come in fellowship with you so dear lord we are just asking we're asking lord your your blessing we're asking our father you will come in a special way to help us lord dear lord we just prayed come and take the bread of life and break it to our heart father we realize oh god we are living in a day where we need you o god we need a god with skin on father we need a one of god that is so real lord father the one is tangible lord almighty god is no time or father for us to be oh god father brother branham type of those fussing over little things as as kindergarten's lord he says we need to grow up father we need to look oh god live for our heads because our redemption is drawing nine so dear lord my prayer this morning father just help me know god the lord father i would come out of myself lord god and and and just father lord you come take your word break it to your children this morning let things be said of internal value lest thing be said that will draw us closer to you thank you father that we have us in our walk with you father lord we love you we appreciate you in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you can have your seed now normally when things happen in the local church that create questions on people's mind is uh is uh is the pastor's responsibility to come out and straighten those things up amen or is his responsibility to come in and you know and enlighten the church on those things but what what is happening or what has happened over the years sometimes those things have been used to go to attack individuals to make them to feel uncomfortable now and and that's the place that you don't want to get because the holy ghost is not going to he's not going to follow your your frustrated spirit you're not going to frustrate the holy ghost amen i mean you're not going to make the holy ghost mad at god's children because you are mad praise the lord because he must instruct his children you cannot change the the the holy ghost from a comforter to become a judgment angels on his people praise the lord you can do that but yet uh and and then sometimes that is the place you know that that that we find ourselves and and when we get ourselves there we have to we have to just ask the lord to help us we have to ask the lord to speak to us you know to kind of give us grace because you don't want to put a human element into the service of the lord even though god used him but you just don't want to do it on your human emotion it's very dangerous for yourself and it's also dangerous for the people so we we kind of a struggle on that but if you realize this morning we we had to switch over from the 70-week tapes that we were playing last week to play the tape on the five identification of a truth church now brother branham brother branham he spoke on that message in 1960 now this this uh this was almost 10 years after the pillar of fire came down in houston when uh when he was you know when when dr bess was trying to challenge him now brother branham said this which of course i believe you heard on tape this morning and i took a phrase from there that i wanted to use as as mine as my subject this morning he said i want to speak tonight on the five definite identification of the truth church of the living god praise the lord the five definite identification now if you believe a prophet and you are following a prophet message you have to you have to see you have to be able to pick up the the five identification if you really want to identify a truth church you got to see because he's the prophet giving us what to look for to be able to identify a true church praise the lord and and when when he deals with this he go ahead and he says the church each one of these subjects that i have chosen tonight to try to speak unto you one of eight he says what is the church who set up the church what is the message of the church how does we be how how how do we become a member of the church and can you get to heaven without being a member of faith so right there he also brings out five different things that he's dealing with in this identification he's going to bring us the five identification i'm not speaking on that this morning we will continue to play the tape you can go home and listen to it and and trust the lord to be able to pick it up but as he's dealing with this he's also breaking out bringing us bringing up to us five elements to help us really be able to identify a truth church because not because we uh uh not because we take a name of of of brother branham message you know to to title i mean to give you as the name of our church all because we have the pillar of cloud photo out there all because i mean uh we we we called brother brandon i mean there are just a lot of things uh i don't want to go into because i can go into some personal things and and share some personal testimony with you and uh and and and all of that recently that a church wrote us i think they got our our address from on the internet and they sent us an email and then i look at the email and his brother was uh was you know then and he was needing some help and and and what a view and he wrote he wrote through the church email and i saw the email then and i told about it i read it and i decided okay i just prayed about the need and i would like to know a little bit about the individual and now these days that people just feel i mean they feed part of the present world by putting everything of themselves on social media so it's easy for you to know what people are doing so i went to look for him i went to look for him a little bit and then and then when i found him you know i mean the first presentation you you see you see most of the element of the message the huffman head of christ jesus the pillow of fire picture and all of that but then when you follow on a little bit and and i mean he just he just have something completely completely different from the message you know have girls all in trousers praying rolling on the ground and ushers and all of that and and and you know and all of there so i just i just i just prayed about it and i dealt with it that that's the end of the story brother brandon went on let me let me go ahead and appreciate in the place that i don't want to be now the first place the word church itself means they're called out now israel was not the church of god as long as they were in egypt they were the people of god and and when and when and then when god called them out of egypt they become the church of god because they were the call out now that still remains the same today the word church means the call out those that have been caught are separated made different i'll move on a little bit now in the old testament the known church was called the kingdom of god the kingdom of god you look there in the book of exeter god told moses that he wanted to deal with the people as a kingdom amen that's the reason why he kept them together he gave them laws that we keep them together that the sabbath and everything they had to observe the ordinance of god together that's that's the way a kingdom runs praise the lord a kingdom does not have two it's not a two-party system no there is one king and everybody is honored that king praise the lord now so verb says in the old testament the old testament brought us a shadow of what the church was supposed to be in in in a kingdom now in the new testament uh we we will read about it a little bit but but yeri said that you have you have to you have to also understand it as the church or as god dare with israel and and are all not a type of a kingdom now in the kingdom even though there are different uh uh uh uh families you know that live in a kingdom but a kingdom one of the success of a kingdom is that the way it is governed is almost governed as a family praise the lord because everybody in the kingdom trace some lineage to the king praise the lord the the trace some way in their family how that king is related to them because remember the king is not voted in the king he he he gets on the throne by a birthright so may even if he's from a different family but that family has a relation to every tribe in the kingdom so that's the reason why they they don't rebel against the king they they take the king as part of their own there is a way that he is related to all the tribes are we together god told true jacob he told israel the scepter would come out of judah but judah was a brother of the other 12 tribes so if a king come out of judah he's still the king of all the 12 tribes because they can trace themselves back to their grandfather which is ruby all uh uh uh joseph all you know uh uh uh the rest of the songs and they will realize that he was a brother to judah so just like how the old testament church succeeded on on a type now succeeded in a way of a kingdom the success of the new testament church is a family paul brings that out in the book of ephesians we'll look at that a little bit the success of the new testament church is a family praise the lord that's the reason why we are all called to one birth which is the new birth to be born again and to be born in christ are we together praise the lord so i just i wanted to lay this down a little bit because we will look at something here he says here as we go along now in the old testament the known church was called the kingdom of god god's kingdom that's the reason why when jesus came even john the baptist when he came his message was the kingdom of heaven is ahead praise the lord when jesus came he came with that same message repent the kingdom of heaven is a hand let's go ahead now i'm i'm i'm talking this from chronologic of the bible he says here the old testament the old testament the church was called the kingdom of god in other words god is a king and the church is his domain god's kingdom old testament in the new testament is called the masonic kingdom amen oh i like that my son kingdom in other words the messiah empire that the masonic empire sorry i love that the messiah in other words the messiah empire where the messiah ruled in ring no denominational barrier or nothing amen the messiah ruled in his empire this that's the there's isn't that wonderful thinking messiah empire therefore the church is not an organization the church is not a gathering of people the church is the people of god that's being called out of the world to serve in another kingdom which is a spiritual kingdom praise the lord amen we have to understand that the church is a mystical body praise the lord but do you know that if you were just spirit and you did not have bothered we would not be able to identify you we will not be able to identify you if you if we were just spirit floating around we were all looks the same praise the lord it's bothered that gives us form and shape praise the lord amen now you can see why brother branham says cry in in the message spoken word is the original seed he said life comes through the body praise the lord i mean you can be able to you can be able to work for god you can be able to to uh uh uh uh sink and and preaching and and rest up there because you have a body you you now have an identity praise the lord even though there are many believers that are spirits you know they don't have a body that they identify with they are just they are just spirit they are floating all over they believe the message i mean they are just spirits praise the lord even though the church is a mystical body but yet we must have an identification where we can call our church where we can be able to stand with the shame of the church and also the glory of the church praise the lord that's why we have a body if we don't have a bother we will not you will not have an identification praise the lord they don't give names to spirits they call them spirits if it's evil then it's the evil spirit are we together now so brother branham says the church is the people of god that has been called out of the world to serve god in another kingdom as a child of god and as a daughter of god if you have if you if you have got a birth and you are part of this messiah empire you're part of this kingdom of god you always want to identify with the people of god praise the lord amen you can go anywhere around the world and maybe you ship over to china or you ship over to africa or different parts of the world and if you are going to be there for a period of time and you're going to live there you want to have a body you want to have an identity praise the lord you want to have a place where you can put your shoulders under the wheels and say i'm identified with this body i will support the costs amen i will bear the glory and when the shame come also we will bear the shame that's that's what a family is praise the lord are we together now when brother branham deal with this i want to take us through a little travel year so we can see something you remember he says uh uh uh samuel says the people has rejected me god says no they have not rejected you samuel i'm the one that they have rejected is that right why because israel had never had a king amen god was their king praise the lord for the mother of father it was the people that re that requested for god to speak through moses that's how a prophetic ministry was developed a man now become the mouthpiece of god amen and then god asks moses now to bring aaron and his sons so now the prophetic ministry now is calling the fightful ministry which is the priesthood and moses had to wash them moses had to dress them moses have to anoint him are we together so now israel was honored the author of prophet and priests and god was the king praise the lord now it's good for me to say this because when we get to revelation chapter 5 you will understand it that the minister of jesus christ has always worked as prophet priest and king it has the old testament shadow is also fulfilled in the new testament now so the heart they had a a a prophet moses that they looked onto and they had a priesthood the aaronic priesthood there that he looked onto but now that that king that king order has never come in flesh there was never a man that was raised in the mount israel that was anointed king until the time of samuel when the people were looking at the other nation brother branham said they wanted to be like the other nation and god said samuel gift give them a praise the lord now but look at this now look at this as you look at in the scripture hundreds of years jacob honor inspiration talking to judah and he said judah the scepter will come from your limbs which means if he was speaking in the name of the lord god has already had a king in mind if jacob was prophesying for god if what he was saying was the word of god then god had a king in mind it was just now the appointed time for god to give them a king if god never wanted his people to have a king he would not prophesy that the scepter would come from judah are we together so it was just not the time now if you even look at the scripture we have spoken about that here i can i can run you through the bible there over in first king but if you look at the scripture you will realize that that is the reason why when samir over in first samuel when samuel spoke to saul and said the lord has looked upon you what the song said he said am i not a benjamite you know why he said that because the king was supposed to come from judah now why are you saying that i will be king am i not a benjamite so saul knew by the word of the lord that it was not the place for a benjamite to be king so there was a haunting feeling in his mind praise the lord and that's what the holy ghost does to the believer the holy ghost destroy every hunting feeling for god has not given us the spirit of fear but the spirit of boldness and sign mind a believer must not have a haunting feeling if you have a haunting feeling it means that there is something wrong there is a question saw her a question he had a haunted him or his ministry he knew he was out of place yes are we together he knew he was out of place because every tribe knew the blessing that was given to their tribe he said am i not a benjaminite well samuel went ahead and anointed him why because it was a choice of the people amen it was the choice of the people with god he don't need the people to choose he brings his men on the scene when it was time for a king to come out of the house of judah he said samuel go to the house of jesse are we together but follow me now now that a king please has come that office has come in flesh a prophet is in flesh a priest is in flesh now a king has been anointed among the people so we have prophet priests and king are we together praise the lord amen i say thank you jesus i will say thank you jesus amen it's because i'm blessed by what i've just said it's it kind of laid a good foundation for me but let's let's go ahead here so because a king office has now been found among the people it has been found among the people god started dealing with israel we know all other things that took place there how how so he sought to uh to kill david even though he had this haunting feeling in his mind but you see i would say it this way is the influence of the pulpit is the influence of power when people have tested power verbancy without character is devilish amen when people have tasted power this this little wool stain that is here is almost like the seat that is called the presidential presidential seat amen it's just a seat that you can sit in but it's a seat of power it has a way of raising the most homeless person it's the same way with this with this sacredness brother branham called it the sacredness are we together it has a way now so here we say paul i mean saul has has he has come up in power even though there is a haunting feeling and he's seeing himself going into one arrow and another arrow and he will not even surround her now you see that is the reason why it was never a problem to jonathan when he identified the gift in david and he knew that he was from the house of judah it was never a problem jonathan did not strive with david because of the ministry he did not strive with david to kick him off the throne he realized that this man is the man even though by right i'm supposed to inherit the throne after my father but when he identified the gift but here is a a sore year having a haunting feeling having a lot of questions in his mind realizing that he's making one mistake and and and samuel came in and said so what have you done he said oh no you know because of the people and the people putting a lot of pressure on me so so i have to do this oh man sami are you not i mean so you're not supposed to do this praise the lord and then he goes from one era to another era and we see he's taking a javelin he's trying to kill david and all of that i'm talking about the type the type of the church we're running the church from the old testament now follow me a little bit now so you see here david being a young man saul went to this to his house the house of jesse anointed him to be king he was anointed to be king but he never came to power praise the lord because he was aiming cho for the throne somebody was keeping him off the troom but yet he was aiming through for the troops so god will use saw reaction to david to train david praise the lord amen he will you saw reaction saw behavior chasing david trying to trap him down he will use all of that to train david and prepare david that at 30 years he will inhabit the throne are we together amen now david become king and uh we know the story there and then after uh we saw david trying to bring the act of the covenant back he failed to consult the prophet it caused death even though he was an anointed king but you have to watch that's how the ministry of jesus works is a prophet priest and king amen the king has his work to do the priest has his work to do and the prophet has his work to do in the order of god the king is not above the prophet the prophet is the highest office in the land are we together so when david refused to consult the prophet he caused a man's life are we together now david left the throne he went by the word of death solomon took the throne and uh uh we know what happened in solomon's life and all of that he built the temple and and right there in jerusalem you know the big temple the glory of god came down and solomon went into his own life uh then we find ourselves here now in first king chapter 13. let's turn there together let's turn it together i pray that the lord will put his blessings on this amen i pray that the lord will put his blessings on this we get to first king chapter 13. praise the lord amen first king chapter 13 yes in first king chapter 13. now so we see now from solomon he gave the throne to his son rihabram when we when richie brown took the throne we realized that his paul joshua he had a very poor judgment to the people you know my father was light with you i whip you with the tilde scorpions and and and because of that the people separated for him now israel now is going to experience for the first time word the tribes are going to separate the first time on a shadow where we're going to see a denomination in the church of israel they have all been honored now remember what what uh uh exodus 13 says god never removed the pillar of fire that's how that chapter ended i read it twice to grab your attention amen now for the first time on a time these people that will honor a prophetic ministry they will always go back to what moses said they will refer back to what moses said and and now for the first time they are going to experience a denomination where two tribes will stay under judah and ten tribes will go as israel are we together amen oh yeah burt branham taught us the church god her roots from the old testament now i'm just i'm just trying to bring this to you in a time so you will realize here now so we realize the scripture says in first kings chapter 13. in first king chapter 13 what we want to pick up here is word jehubrah now which was the captain of the lord host or captain of the army okay i want to i want i just want to get to the verse instead of doing a long reading year praise the lord okay let's look let's look here close sorry sorry this uh over in chapter 12. sorry it's in chapter 12. now chapter 2 verse 26. or verse 25 would show us something here then jerry brown bale said him in the mount of ephraim and door there and went out from thence and built pineal and jehubram said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of devin if these people go up to do sacrifice in in the house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of the people turn again unto thee our lord even unto rihanna the king of judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehebron king of judah worth word upon the king took counsel and made two calves of god and said unto the people is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods or israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and he set one in belter and the other in dan praise the lord and and this thing became a sin for the people went up to worship before the one even unto them and he made a house of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people wish when that they were not of the sons of levi praise the lord now this is a shadow of the trinity in the old testament this is the shadow of the birth of pagan room in the old testament are we together now follow me now so uh uh jeroboam now he was the captain the kingdom has played it two tribes they were rihabram the ten tribes are now with jehovah that one kingdom that will honor one god they were honor they had one place to worship that was in jerusalem now jehu brahm the scripture said because of fear in his heart he says if the people continue to go to jerusalem to worship the heart will be after the king of judah so now i'm going to make two places belter and dan so now israel had three places to go in washington they had dan they have belter and they had jerusalem are we together amen if they want to make an excuse they can stay right there now remember he never told the church of israel that don't go to jerusalem oh they are in the wrong no he never told him that he said it's just too much for you to be leaving from here and going all the way to jerusalem it's too much i'm going to build a place right here for you you group here you can come here and you group here you can come here it shows like a concern it shows like a clearing but this is the thing that was going to take israel hot into idolatry this is the thing that is that was going to take the heart of the people away from god praise the lord the scripture says and this thing became a scene for the people and over and over the scripture talks about the sin of jerubrah now when this was done israel was caught up in this confusion can you imagine a man and his wife arguing and the wife says i'm going to jerusalem you know for the matter of fact these men that are preached here they are now on the trap of levi they are not even qualified to be in the priesthood i'm not going down there the husband said well me i'm tired today i worked too much yesterday i'm not able to to get on no donkey to go down you want to go you and the children you can go i will stay right here i'll go down there and make my sacrifice it started breaking homes it started stealing the heart of the people no matter if he took the same pattern that was in jerusalem he might have designed the altar the same way that there is no way you can come over to dan that you will not even miss jerusalem in your mind because he he copy everything the same you have to know what is dealing with is the heart as long as the people because god told them there is a place where i would put my name and the place that i put my name is the place i would meet the worshipers you can design the building the same praise the lord you can design the building the same dress the church just like branham tabernacle if you are not bringing the people back to the world you are taking their heart away from god and this thing started dealing with the hearts of the people now look just read the rest of the story when it got over to ahab the church married into paganism the church married into paganism that was the birth of nissan council in the bible because here is ihab an israel king marrying an idol worshiper daughter a priest it was from this very step of bringing people that have no right to make sacrifice no right to handle the word and as long as he could get the people to say amen oh israel is too much it's too much it was that now the language of korah and dayton it's too much moses is making too much of himself they come and say it's too much why should we just say brother branham said brother branham said brother branham said it's too much and by that simple statement he was able to take the hearts of the people away from god oh no no wonder that day when when when uh when jerubrah preached that message there were people amen preach it brother go ahead preach it amen and you think those priests that were put in those offices you think they were preaching something contrary no they were reading the very law of moses to be able to win the house of the people they were quoting what moses said they were trying to do everything to imitate the temple in jerusalem but now israel is caught up in confusion this sunday this family say okay let's go to that let's go to jerusalem first honey let me first on it you know first on every first sunday we can go the rest of the sunday we can stay here but all of those things were taking the hearts of the people away from god praise the lord amen amen it's not how much of an identification how much we try to copycat and try to do everything you know we try to line out our statement like brother branham we try to be high like brother branham and this that if the word is not dealing with your heart if christ the word is not dealing with your heart if the word is not changing you it's not drawing you close to god that is the thing that you must watch it's your personal relationship with god amen that's the thing you should watch it's not building the image of a man holy you know that brother he can preach i mean just like a machine gun he knows the courts he i mean he knows the message you are just building a man you are building an idol that is taking your heart from the world what is important here is the word of god dealing with your heart that's what is important it's not the man that preached it's not the kind of music that they play are you having relationship with the world yes they were doing daily sacrifice everything that they were doing in jerusalem they were doing it in down they were doing it in belter but the heart of the people was going away from the lord until when their king choose to marry a priest's daughter there was no man in israel to stand against it oh yeah it's good maybe we can win them over i mean we can we can win them over the church will become big and we see that our sauces the church will become big and i mean i mean what's that i mean we can win them over there was nobody there there was nobody in this priesthood maybe the one that was the high priest he was the one said they encouraged ahab to go ahead but it brought israel into idolatry they think that will enslave israel for their rest for the rest of their journey it will make them to lost their identity pretty soon the seminary of the prophets of baal was built amen and all of those men you know how they call it they never call it the seminary of ba they call it the school of prophets that's how they call it so they were called the sons of the prophets it was called the school of prophets if you really want to know what the prophet said go to that school praise the lord that's why that's that's where our seminary birth came from a place where man goes and argue and reason upon the word they bring their own discourse upon the world no paul said this but you know actually i call into this it's not supposed to be it was good for that time but it's not good for this time they bring all of those arguments into the world that's what seminary was birth but all of those things all of those things was taking the heart of the people away from the lord praise the lord that is the reason why my calendar showed them elijah identified what was the problem he took one stone for a tribe to show how the heart of the people has become so high against god's word they can just reason it up here but it's not going down yet why because it's not changing their lives so he took one stone for a tribe and he gathered it together listen to what he says oh lord god let it be known this day that i've done what you have said yes i have turned the heart of the people back that is the reason of the elijah ministry this elijah ministry is to deal with your heart is to turn your heart back to god not to a man not to a church that is the purpose of the elijah ministry when elijah came israel was in darkness confusion they were claiming to be the the people of god but yeah they were they were they were so caught up in this trinitarian doctrine where they don't even now have an identification that there is no way they can go back to what the early fathers believe but yet they were still cutting from the book of moses but they were gone from the principle of god can you imagine all these jewish boys going to schools of the prophets and what are they teaching them there you know all of these things our father abraham you know he was another worshiper so i mean we gotta bear with these people you know uh we can we can change them we we i mean forgetting to know that god has been dealing with him as a kingdom and the way to be able to identify one as your own you must trace him back to his breath stone out of this nation that you are bringing in can you trace them back to their breath stone because every trap in israel had a breast stone your breath stone is your identity praise the lord they forgot they are the mothers were on the breath pains and proclaim their names on the breath pains and now you would just you just bring in you know this this worshiper and and and you know why is that because the king the one that is the head of the church because the king was the one that was the the head you know the the physical head of the of the of of the kingdom you know what he started doing he started killing those prophets that would speak against him he started shutting them down so all those prophets were now hiding in their cave with their little group but they were still claiming that jehovah is their king are we together i think god caught my heart as i was looking through the scripture and as i was reading brother branham here he was bringing the old testament church in the time of the new testament church that's the very same thing that happens on the date of pentecost the pillar of fire came down the people identified god in their mess their gifts were given praise the lord god never only gave the gift to the 12 apostles and say you are the people that walk with jesus now receive the holy ghost let all of these people follow you know he distributed to everyone everyone even mary the mother of jesus mary magdalene solomon all of those women that were there received the same holy ghost he never said peter now you you are the pastor receive more holy ghost than these people praise the lord they all receive the same holy ghost god coming down in the midst of the church not segregating not creating a hierarchy because that's the thing that god hates when you separate the people and you think that yeah we we are the we are the ministers we we are the elders there is nothing like that in the church of the living god there is only one b mediator between man and god and that's the main christ jesus we all are subject to this world we might as we might have gifts and offices it does not make us above the people no that was just how the nucleating doctrine came in the same way other worship came in israel church that was just how the nicolaitan spirit creeped in to this church where every one of them received the same holy ghost even peter when he went down there and preached to those gentiles in acts chapter 10 and he realized he realized the same anointing that was in the upper room it's the same presence that came down in colina's house he says god he says there is no favoritism with god god is not respected of man he said he had given these gentiles the same holy ghost that he had given to us who can forbade them from water god didn't say no you know i'm going to give him a lighter experience the same holy ghost the same pillow of fire are we together now that's what brought the elijah ministries on the scene i'm going to read something to you from bert branham that's what brought the elijah ministry on the scene why because the hearts of the people were gone the hearts of the people were gone this ministry of jesus christ elijah ministry is to bring the hearts of the people back to god is to bring the hearts of the people back to god how do you know that you are in the message when god is dealing with your heart amen if god is making your heart to treasure in the message of the hour if you are taking this word ask your preeminence because where your treasure is there your heart will be are we together wednesday night we read these quotes where we were talking about how the trinity doctrine is preparing the people for the battle of america i want to go back to to i want to go back to that and just uh pick up something here that we we read praise the lord amen amen what a wonderful jesus we save amen praise the lord the lord is so good to us yes yeah he's so good to us after scene of the holy ghost we we read that on wednesday night where he talks about the places i've been how does fortune teller works how does evil spirit travel i want you to to believe me as your pastor cause you are the one i'm speaking to the devil travels in the name of father son and the holy ghost they cut feathers and everything and they throw spells on each other through the name of father son and the holy ghost praise the lord and this is the and this is the spirit that is leading the last dead church this is the anointing that the last this church is honored and as we read from revelation chapter 16 how is preparing the people for the great day the great battle which is the battle of america praise the lord now saul just like we can see in time how that thing came in israel god was able to achieve to raise up a prophet moses that he spoke to mouth and ear god was able to achieve to raise up a priesthood when even the sons of a era aaron taught that it was a family thing god came down and struck them dead to kind of put an emphasis that this is my statue praise the lord god was able to raise up a king that he called a man after his own heart all of that was in shadow of the ministry of jesus christ praise the lord because there is there is three men in the bible three men in the bible that play in the role of prophet priest and king moses we know he was a prophet he was called the king of jerome praise the lord and before the priesthood office was brought in because he was the one that watched the priests and present and and presented them in in his office i can i can take a you know a bunch of scriptures and show you that and the next man in the scripture that also worked as prophet prison king was david we know that he was a king amen but we also know that david when he was running away from saul presented himself to the priests in the temple amen because the short bread was only for the priest to eat praise the lord and david was introduced into the priest's office by partaking of the shortbread and we also know that he was a prophet because he had a gift on him that we even prophesied about the messiah my god my god what have thou forsaken me and the tear man in scripture that fulfill that the prophet preaching king is our lord jesus so you see when god established that in the old testament when he established it in the old testament it was just a shadow to be able to point us over to the coming of the mosaic empire the messiah kingdom amen praise the lord and we find out that the same shadow in the old testament that would separate the people the way the enemy would come in and try to to reduce the confidence of the world to try to rob the church of her power because our power is in the world that's where our power that this this this is our our armor beg this is where the church power is praise the lord just like brother branham he says just like how the stick was in moses hands he says that's how the name of jesus is in the church of the living god he says it's fairer than egyptian knew they were just going to take that steak from moses because every time he would call a plague on israel he would stretch that stake they saw him doing it all the time that they're supposed to take the stick from him because after all the sticks swallowed the ass snake praise the lord and he says that is the same way the name of jesus christ is in the new testament church take that name away give the church titles you rob the church of its power you will make witchcraft to be comfortable amen you will make fornicators and idolaters to be comfortable but when the name of jesus stand in the church as chapter 5 has to come back on the scene the world goes out and deals with the people it conveys their heart and brings them to the altar praise the lord are we together i see you far past my time musicians you can come you can come because we can go on with this on and on praise the lord but i just wanted to show you this and increase your appetite to go home and continue to listen to that message the five identification of a true church praise the lord you cannot identify the truth church better than the prophet cain he's the word that the word comes to we we might have our ideas you know we might have our ideas we might come from different church background and think that if this church is not like my church maybe there's something wrong with it go back to the word go back to the message of the hour there are things that we can do as a local church that we think is is good for our group we must not make it a judgment or a comparison for every local church to do the same it's only good for our group it's good for this assembly [Music] and i say it again if you are just taking your your identification [Music] as a message believer because you were born in the message oh you are taking your identification because you are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ or you taking your identification because you belong to this church what i will tell you this morning is god dealing with your heart because brother branham says there is two things that the messenger of malachi 4 would do he said two things he would turn our house back to the hearts of the father and he will open the seven seals of revelation five and ten he says and as those the opening of the seals will literally turn our heart back that is the purpose of of this message of the hour [Music] is god literally turning your heart back is god dealing with your heart don't just take comfort because you come to church on sunday [Music] but is god speaking to your heart is that something that you're struggling with in your heart and in your mind don't be like saul don't don't go with a haunting spirit if there is anything that is haunting you there is enough power in this world to forgive you there is enough power in this world to deliver you there is enough power in this world to set you free you don't have to go with your haunting spirit [Music] and if you are not baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ we have an open invitation for you [Music] i pray that the lord will bless each and every one of you i pray that god we have access to our hearts [Music] i pray that he will deal with our hearts blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord the lord most high blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord the lord moses the name of the lord is as strong [Music] righteous rolling too and they are saved the name of the lord [Music] hey i say jesus is the name jesus is the name of the lord jesus is the name of the lord oh jesus is the name of the lord the law moves out jesus is the name of the lord jesus is the name of the lord [Laughter] jesus is the name of the lord the lord [Music] lord my heart is open let's just sing that chorus as just once again we just want to we just want to dedicate our hearts to the lord amen young people that's what you should be looking for [Music] be looking for god dealing with your heart sometimes when you say speak to me [Music] sometimes when god speaks it's not in the language that we understand sometimes it's not with words [Music] he just keep staring certain thing on your heart he keeps
