[0:41] [Music]
[0:50] thank you
[0:57] father
[1:03] I tell you in these last days when we
[1:07] see this quick and power upon us we even
[1:09] give quickly power to us to see the
[1:11] fishing
[1:12] we have seen the quickly power working
[1:14] Among Us like it was and upon them in
[1:16] the early age
[1:17] to sit bring back Foundation raise the
[1:19] Dead
[1:20] make the stick wet
[1:22] the other day I was telling someone's a
[1:24] little Donovan works yeah I guess you
[1:25] all know him I was up front hunt lady
[1:28] for those fellas a nice little guy to
[1:30] come to your Churchill he's a very good
[1:32] friend of mine and he just said they
[1:33] didn't want to buy I looked his ear
[1:34] turned all inside out and I said hi
[1:37] Donovan you're talking about a hand like
[1:38] a cancer
[1:41] Dr Thomas what's America year so don't
[1:44] know about them at six seven months I
[1:46] said why you say something about I said
[1:48] uh I didn't want to holler you brother
[1:50] man I said you know what it is that I
[1:52] have an idea
[2:28] and the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:32] and the year of the grace and mighty
[2:36] works that you have done before
[2:39] and now we stand with anticipation
[2:43] raises our faith and announces to
[2:45] believe that what has been asked for
[2:48] tonight will be granted but God knows
[2:51] each and every one of them
[2:53] all that they have requested and we pray
[2:56] for them especially Lord those who are
[2:59] so near death
[3:01] bring peace to their soul if it isn't
[3:04] already there
[3:05] r
[3:08] [Music]
[3:17] that we have a symbol knowing that
[3:19] wherever two or more assembled together
[3:22] you'll be with us yes and we ask you
[3:25] Lord
[3:26] forgive us your word tonight to speak to
[3:30] us Lord and warn our heartstrings
[3:33] that we would know how to discipline
[3:36] ourselves
[3:37] a time that lays ahead as we believe
[3:40] that we're nearing the coming of the
[3:43] Lord we thank thee for our people now
[3:46] beginning to find Faith dear to them and
[3:49] knowing what they mean
[3:54] [Music]
[3:57] to do something Lord we're waiting with
[4:00] anticipation in his life the days of old
[4:04] that the time is near when you're going
[4:07] to just raise up the windows of heaven
[4:09] and pour out the Lord that God has
[4:13] promised in this last day
[4:15] how we ask you Lord
[4:18] to be with all around the Nations as the
[4:21] day we heard so many around everywhere
[4:24] that's in need
[4:25] grant them their request Lord and we
[4:28] pray to see the great hand of God moving
[4:32] all over the world among those who are
[4:34] looking for this great thing
[4:36] forgive us of our sin
[4:39] chase the slide of thy spirit in our
[4:42] word that we might discipline ourselves
[4:44] to obedient servants
[4:47] [Music]
[4:49] in the will of God
[4:51] let us remember and try to think in our
[4:54] hearts watch the early Christians done
[4:56] what type of people would we meet when
[4:59] we met those who had personally been in
[5:03] contact with you how their faith is with
[5:05] the lift up with faith and joy how their
[5:09] lives must have been the Living Word of
[5:12] God just written Epistles read of all
[5:15] men as they walked in among people
[5:18] God granted once more may Our Lives be
[5:21] so submitted to thee that the holy
[5:23] spirit will live itself through us and
[5:26] speak to us Lord
[5:28] may we remember in our minds as we walk
[5:31] up on the street and rub arms at the
[5:34] world we're not supposed to be like
[5:36] those
[5:37] if we step aside and give them the place
[5:40] for in their rightful position here on
[5:42] Earth they'll take the back seat knowing
[5:45] that we are delegates from another world
[5:46] Amen we have a kingdom that's coming in
[5:49] the power of Jesus and our great king
[5:52] will soon arise and take over all the
[5:55] kings is in his domains and he shall
[5:58] Rule and reign with him here on Earth
[6:01] thousand years and be with him forever
[6:03] with this in mind Lord now we look
[6:06] forward to the answer of our prayer
[6:09] they look there are confession if we
[6:11] have did anything said anything or
[6:14] thought anything that was contrary to
[6:16] your great will that the blood of Jesus
[6:19] Christ cleans the leaves
[6:21] lead us Lord as the sister said tonight
[6:24] about she and her husband on the road to
[6:26] Chicago leads them Lord God to the place
[6:29] that you can use that they might be
[6:31] beings of life for others who are hoping
[6:34] to Darkness that knows not our lord
[6:37] Jesus right now we commit the service to
[6:40] you and listening for your word of
[6:41] Correction and we might know how to
[6:44] prepare for this great hour in Jesus
[6:47] name we ask that amen
[6:51] thank you brother
[6:53] I was a little bit unexpected of this I
[6:57] being here at home I felt like if I if I
[7:00] was really I had to go somewhere
[7:02] emergency I'd feel very bad be sitting
[7:04] at home and I'd come to prayer meeting
[7:06] and I kind of dropped in unexpected to
[7:09] myself even to my family and just got in
[7:11] and tougher at all and so I thought I'm
[7:14] going down to prayer meeting and she
[7:16] didn't even have time to get ready to
[7:17] come so she didn't know I was coming so
[7:20] I'm happy to hear the sister's testimony
[7:22] there the brother about that light up in
[7:26] South Carolina or North Carolina
[7:28] somewhere Greenville was it
[7:33] was just here today I'm baptized you
[7:36] today in the baptism service here today
[7:38] brother leave alien or other
[7:41] ministers there
[7:43] brother Parker Thomas
[7:44] they was um
[7:47] I remember of a of the time of sister
[7:51] being shattered that it was a great
[7:52] confirmation sister
[7:55] the uh the Holy Spirit sometimes will
[7:58] let us go ahead and test our faith to
[8:00] see what and test others facing when
[8:03] you're looking directly at something and
[8:05] see something and say it others look and
[8:07] don't see it they say it's not there see
[8:08] but it is there now there was no one to
[8:11] see that life that's hanging over Paul
[8:13] but it was there and no one's seen that
[8:16] Dove coming down out of heaven in that
[8:18] light in a form and hung over Jesus but
[8:19] John himself but it was asking and so
[8:22] then later when I was telling the people
[8:25] about this light being like a pillar of
[8:27] fire no one wanted to believe it but now
[8:29] the mechanical eye of the camera
[8:31] identified that yeah I promised the evil
[8:34] spirit is dark it's just like our lives
[8:36] were Shadows
[8:38] and we're if we're right we're if our
[8:40] lives cope with the light of the day
[8:43] we're walking in line it's just like you
[8:46] look out and say I see the sun in the
[8:48] daytime you you see the shadow of the
[8:50] sun it's a reflection of the sun isn't
[8:53] the sun itself but it proves that there
[8:55] is a sun amen it proves there is the Sun
[8:58] and now when I see uh like she's sitting
[9:02] out there using fans talking that means
[9:04] you're living but it's only a shadow of
[9:07] life because anything has got to have
[9:10] darkness is to make a Shadow see yeah
[9:12] because a shadow has possessed so much
[9:14] darkness and so much light to make a
[9:16] Shadow and it can't be all together dark
[9:18] you can't be all together life if it's
[9:20] dark it's real dark if it's like there's
[9:22] a little nothing to make a Shadow
[9:23] but if it's mixed with dark and light it
[9:26] makes a shadow so we are really Shadows
[9:29] of life now you're reflecting a life
[9:31] from somewhere amen if you are in
[9:34] Christians this being a shadow it only
[9:36] proves that there is a life where you
[9:37] can't die because this life has this in
[9:40] it see yes but it's a shadow because
[9:42] you're living moving creature with
[9:46] abilities to seize things move and talk
[9:50] and the five senses of the body but yet
[9:53] you know they're dying and there's so
[9:56] much trouble you know it can only be the
[9:59] it's a reflection see that there's life
[10:02] and death mixed together the physical
[10:04] has to die
[10:06] but if you are reflecting by your moral
[10:09] life the light of heaven then you're
[10:11] reflecting the eternal life amen then
[10:16] when you die you can not only go to that
[10:18] light because that's what you reflected
[10:20] if you are the Dark World you reflect
[10:22] that and you can do go the other way but
[10:25] to God see and we are in a reflection so
[10:29] we see that as sure as the Holy Spirit
[10:32] reflects life and Life Soul does death
[10:36] reflect darkness and here they both are
[10:40] um it is a week maybe by Sunday we are
[10:44] getting the small photograph blown up
[10:47] to a large size so it can be put on the
[10:49] billboard or your picture hangs out
[10:52] there on the billboard I've only noticed
[10:54] it or not and then
[10:56] uh about a week ago in in Jamaica where
[11:00] it was missionary we sent tapes all over
[11:02] the world and the Seven Seals has got
[11:05] back into uh way back into the inlands
[11:08] of Jamaica way in the interior it's very
[11:12] primitive back in there behind Blue
[11:13] Mountains and the ladies sometimes they
[11:16] have a tape recorder a gift for them a
[11:19] chance to like the old victrola crank it
[11:22] and then let it play like that and every
[11:24] few minutes somebody has to crank it
[11:25] this group had a little a battery a six
[11:29] volt battery or something there playing
[11:31] this tape recorder and it is all setting
[11:33] together about once here tonight
[11:34] listening to those seals I believe it
[11:37] was and while I was speaking they
[11:39] noticed coming in the rooms in the same
[11:41] Pillar of Fire
[11:44] settle down over the top of it and they
[11:47] went and got a camera and tucked a
[11:49] picture of it and just the same ones
[11:51] there it is hanging right there over now
[11:54] we're getting to blow it up so we can
[11:55] put on the billboard out there that you
[11:57] can see it you are so grateful for the
[12:00] grace of God that's been brought into
[12:03] us into his presence now
[12:08] we are grateful for many things huh I
[12:12] think I'm looking here and see if I can
[12:14] find some some notes or something
[12:16] something other than spoken or get some
[12:18] kind of a
[12:19] um I got some text wrote out in way back
[12:22] in here in a book same time we'll meet
[12:25] you at all give me something to stay
[12:26] home something uh
[12:31] we're under anticipation
[12:34] for our sin
[12:35] I have been speaking uh in the messages
[12:38] and Sunday kept here a long time on why
[12:42] Christ sounds to me speak to the people
[12:45] and go forward now Sunday is the healing
[12:49] service or the sickest that we pray for
[12:52] it now you get around to the sick and
[12:54] there's got to be some reason that the
[12:57] sick when we pray for him if they're not
[13:00] healed and I want to it's the largely
[13:01] for just a sharp sermon on Sunday
[13:03] morning so I'm going to have a healing
[13:06] service and pray for all the peoples and
[13:08] uh Billy Paul or someone will be here
[13:11] Sunday Morning by 8 o'clock when the
[13:13] church opens they give the people cards
[13:15] as they come in the door
[13:17] um or whenever they get in and now um
[13:19] then I want to how I believe the Lord
[13:22] has somehow give me a little insight on
[13:25] the reasons why uh there's some people
[13:29] are not healed and I I believe this lack
[13:32] of understanding
[13:34] and I I believe maybe we'll speak on
[13:36] that Sunday morning the Lord willing now
[13:40] Wednesday night prayer meeting is just a
[13:42] short meeting where we get together and
[13:44] pray as we have and Associate together
[13:47] sometimes I believe one of the great
[13:49] things that I find in this day is the
[13:52] lack of sincerity of what we believe
[13:55] yeah
[13:57] if God in the days of John Wesley would
[14:01] have done in that day what he has done
[14:03] today
[14:04] what would have done the days of Martin
[14:06] Luther are what more as what we see him
[14:10] doing both proven by the church by the
[14:14] spirit and by science and every move
[14:17] that it's it's in motion has to
[14:19] recognize and God's word here declaring
[14:22] it and telling it before it comes to
[14:25] pass amen and then moving upon is
[14:27] prophesying and showing the very things
[14:29] that he said that have come to pass
[14:32] perfectly it's exactly what he says and
[14:35] still we sit highly slow as if we wonder
[14:38] well wonder if that can mean me wonder
[14:41] if it could mean just the the church and
[14:44] whole uh what about being included in
[14:46] this I think Sunday morning I try to
[14:48] talk on some of those principles that my
[14:50] in life is a little now tonight I found
[14:54] something has turned to it therefore
[14:56] come down I thought what a brother never
[14:57] was I get down on you have to say get up
[14:59] and speak and sit down
[15:01] they better write down a couple of
[15:03] scriptures that's all uh I know he's
[15:06] he's such a lovely brother and we um
[15:09] we appreciate it before we pray over the
[15:13] words I want to recognize them a brother
[15:16] I can't even call his name at this time
[15:18] two of them
[15:19] they are here friends of mine uh the
[15:25] their ministers and evangelists in the
[15:28] field going out they heard these
[15:30] messages by Tate and they're out of
[15:33] different denominational churches two
[15:35] young fellows and
[15:37] the boys so what I'm so interested that
[15:39] he flew down Tucson just recently and
[15:41] closing out a meeting I believe I was in
[15:44] the businessman's breakfast and Young
[15:46] fella fine young fella come down and
[15:48] he's they're from Kansas
[15:50] and they come all the way here for me to
[15:53] marry him
[15:54] I appreciate that to think that people
[15:57] are even your prayers enough believe
[15:59] that God would hear an answer and young
[16:02] people starting out in life like this
[16:04] and when he got here for me to marry him
[16:06] yesterday to find out the state law of
[16:08] Indiana requires them even though it's
[16:10] their blood test the weight near the
[16:12] state three days before the human hair
[16:13] so they cannot be married until Friday
[16:16] morning
[16:19] if you'll just stand up and tell us who
[16:22] he is and his lovely little uh lady
[16:25] there and the next brother
[16:48] [Music]
[16:50] another large time here on the end and
[16:53] it's a decent amount of heroin Iowa
[16:57] so thank you very much
[16:59] we certainly wish these young
[17:02] ambassadors for the work of the Lord
[17:05] Jesus God's blessings to speed them on
[17:09] the way
[17:10] and as I wondering waiting for the
[17:13] coming of the Lord and see young man and
[17:15] young women with a purpose and heart to
[17:17] serve Christ that's real
[17:19] see them raise up like this the Lord
[17:22] bless you richly my brother sister
[17:25] now
[17:27] let us turn over to a little book that I
[17:29] never spoke out of before in my life
[17:32] and it's a very just one chapter
[17:35] the book of films
[17:38] and uh
[17:40] I'm just a little bit Irish
[17:43] and uh and I do have a wall around the
[17:46] bottom teeth to hold a couple in the
[17:48] back in place uh
[17:51] I sometimes I don't pronounce these
[17:53] names right when I do know what they are
[17:55] and sometimes I can't pronounce them
[17:56] right for the rise of Education
[17:59] so Freeman someone said back there which
[18:02] I think is really the correct
[18:03] pronunciation of it now the first verse
[18:07] I want to take just a word or two form
[18:09] it
[18:10] Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[18:15] and that's what I want to use tonight as
[18:18] a text the Lord willing
[18:20] is a prison amen now you could hardly
[18:25] imagine
[18:28] Paul regarding himself a prison
[18:31] a Born Free Man filled with the Holy
[18:35] Spirit but yet he calls himself a
[18:39] prisoner and now we find out when he's
[18:41] addressing the Corinthians all an
[18:44] apostle of Jesus Christ
[18:46] another time Paul a servant of Jesus
[18:49] Christ
[18:50] by the will of God
[18:52] when he speaks into Timothy different
[18:55] ones now when he's writing here's a
[18:57] screaming he says Paul a prisoner of
[19:01] Jesus Christ Paul an apostle
[19:10] a prisoner but tonight being it takes
[19:15] hours to duly consider one of the
[19:18] subjects I'd like to take tonight's Paul
[19:21] the prisoner
[19:23] and take the subject of a prisoner now
[19:27] let us bow our heads just a moment God
[19:30] Jesus
[19:31] any man that's physically able can pull
[19:34] back the pages of this Bible
[19:37] but only the Holy Spirit can interpret
[19:39] it in the life that it's been meant to
[19:42] we asked him to come now and help us to
[19:44] understand what this was addressed this
[19:48] Great Mighty prophet oh and yet call
[19:53] himself a prisoner
[19:55] May the Holy Spirit reveal this to us as
[19:58] we wait on him in Jesus Christ's name
[20:01] amen
[20:04] now
[20:05] I can imagine
[20:07] uh of Paul when he wrote this letter
[20:10] the filming how he was
[20:13] uh setting in jail
[20:17] uh down there in the dungeons of this
[20:21] estate
[20:22] a prison
[20:24] and he can well know by his position
[20:27] what the word meant
[20:30] he was surrounded by by bars he could
[20:35] only be left free as someone was letting
[20:38] go free
[20:39] and he knew what it was to be a prisoner
[20:43] and then again I believe that the
[20:45] Apostle meant just a little not exactly
[20:49] addressing it to use prayers and
[20:50] conditions
[20:52] as being a prisoner of his his physical
[20:55] being set in here in this in this uh
[20:58] jail
[20:59] but I believe he was referring to his
[21:02] his being his his Spirit his will and
[21:07] being a prisoner to Jesus Christ
[21:10] now we're all born a free moral agent to
[21:14] make any decision that we wish you
[21:16] God justly does that because he must put
[21:19] every man on the same basis or he put
[21:21] the wrong man on he fought the first man
[21:23] on the wrong basis that he put on three
[21:25] more relationships they were just as
[21:27] fast as I get him in Eve there's no
[21:30] difference right around says before
[21:32] either one of us life and death we can
[21:34] make our choice amen it's up to you to
[21:36] make it see if that's the way Adam and
[21:38] Eve did and seeing and they made the
[21:41] wrong choice
[21:42] and now by that put the whole race of
[21:46] human race under death the penalty of
[21:49] death and then God came down in the form
[21:51] of man and took that death and paid the
[21:54] penalty of death that there is subjects
[21:57] that desire to be free could go free now
[22:00] if he took us without the same uh way
[22:05] that he did Adam Eve just pulled us
[22:08] through something said I said he really
[22:09] won't say it or not then he put Adam and
[22:11] Eve on on the wrong base but each one of
[22:14] us has to choose this day between death
[22:18] and life we can do it is our just
[22:20] Express if your life will prove you're
[22:23] alive or prove exactly what side you're
[22:26] on I don't care what side you say you're
[22:28] on watch you do every day cruise wants
[22:31] you off
[22:32] you've heard the old saying your life is
[22:35] so loud I can't hear your testimony see
[22:37] your your actions this allowed I've
[22:40] always pleased and shouting and jumping
[22:42] but I've always said don't jump no
[22:44] higher than you live because the world's
[22:46] going to watch that you see you must
[22:48] just uh jump as high as you live
[22:51] so because Somebody's Watching You
[22:55] and now when people won't come to church
[22:58] they many of them just won't do it and
[23:02] some of them not cunning is sincere
[23:04] people
[23:05] they see so much corruption in the
[23:07] church until they don't want to have
[23:09] anything to do with it
[23:11] and many times we are speaking on a flat
[23:15] thought of that you can hardly blame it
[23:18] see because of the way that people act
[23:20] they call themselves Christians they're
[23:22] the greatest stumbling block that the
[23:24] World Cup is the man and woman who
[23:26] professes to be a Christian and lives
[23:28] something different from their
[23:29] profession exactly right that's where
[23:32] the disappointments will be coming at
[23:33] the judge Now The Sinner The Bootlegger
[23:37] The Gambler the adulteress he won't be
[23:40] uh disappointed here his sentence read
[23:43] to depart into Everlasting fire he won't
[23:46] be disappointed but that fella who's
[23:49] trying to hide himself behind some kind
[23:51] of a church profession that's the boy
[23:54] that's going to be disappointed at the
[23:55] day of judgment see that profess us to
[23:58] be a Christian and live some other way
[24:00] you'd be better for him that he never
[24:02] did even make any kind of profession
[24:03] start at all then to start and live
[24:06] something different because he's the
[24:07] greatest dumb and all we got is for that
[24:10] professor that says that he he he is a
[24:14] Christian and lives something different
[24:15] always don't judge your life for how
[24:18] much power you have to perform miracles
[24:21] and we don't judge ourselves but how
[24:24] much knowledge you have of the word
[24:27] but always judge yourself look back and
[24:30] take an inventory of what kind of a
[24:32] fruit that the lies you presently live
[24:35] now is there see as I speak some time
[24:38] ago at a businessman's meeting and
[24:41] Phoenix Arizona of uh the reflection of
[24:45] Jesus a reflecting Christian Life
[24:48] but then I was born up here in Kentucky
[24:50] where it's very primitive especially
[24:53] back when I was a kid
[24:55] and this similar boy I never had a a
[24:59] home like we had here
[25:02] we had so many pretty ladies that have
[25:05] to look through Mayors all through the
[25:07] house to keep their hair just in place
[25:09] and so forth but he had one little mayor
[25:12] just a little piece tacked on a tree on
[25:15] the outside where the wash was
[25:17] where he's mother and father washed and
[25:19] they combed their hair and so forth in
[25:21] this little piece of an old man attacked
[25:24] on a tree frankly that's the type of a
[25:27] home that we have anybody wants to see a
[25:28] mayor we kids we had to get a box to get
[25:30] up on the wash bench and look at this
[25:32] piece of a of a narrative
[25:35] I picked up myself in a dump that wasn't
[25:38] down in Kentucky that you're in Indiana
[25:39] up on a Utica Pike here
[25:42] now this little kid has never exactly
[25:44] seen himself like that so he comes to
[25:47] the city to visit his grandma
[25:50] and
[25:51] throw a room the Grandma had a house
[25:54] that had a complete mare on the door
[25:58] and so we're about running through the
[26:00] room
[26:02] seen another little boy in finally the
[26:05] little boy was running also so he
[26:06] thought he should stop a few minutes to
[26:08] see what the little lab would go to do
[26:10] and when he stopped the little boy stop
[26:13] he turned he says a little boy turned
[26:16] his head
[26:17] scratched his head a little I scratched
[26:19] his
[26:20] finally walked closer to investigate and
[26:23] he turned around his mother watched him
[26:25] and his grandmother was amazing said
[26:27] well our mother that's me
[26:30] Dora said that we too are a reflecting
[26:36] something
[26:38] see our life is reflected
[26:41] and now if we live in the days of Noah
[26:44] whose side would we take
[26:46] what side were we talking at Great uh or
[26:49] a day that Noah lives what size were we
[26:52] talking the days of Moses what side in
[26:55] the Days of Elijah the prophet when all
[26:59] the world was golfed up in a a great a
[27:02] massive uh of modernism like the modern
[27:06] Jezebel and had read all the Servants of
[27:09] the Lord out into a whirly way in the
[27:11] church that priests is all abide to her
[27:13] would you accept the side of popularity
[27:16] or would you stupid Elijah
[27:18] now within the days of the Lord Jesus
[27:21] when we thank this unpopular person
[27:23] uneducated by the world those schools
[27:27] they could ever find that he went to and
[27:29] all those Seminary experience and and
[27:32] then raise up with the name of
[27:34] illegitimate birth and that kind of
[27:37] preaching a gospel that was contrary
[27:39] that anything that they had been taught
[27:41] very in condemning the ministers in
[27:43] their organizations and so forth and the
[27:47] organizations that made a a statement of
[27:50] anybody even went to hear the so-called
[27:52] prophets would be put out of the
[27:54] synagogue which was a model sin they had
[27:58] to be a tatted or really to worship us
[28:01] are the blood of the Lamb they had to
[28:03] come to this sacrifice and and then they
[28:05] were outcasts and what a great thing it
[28:07] was and this man ignored such as that
[28:10] and yet he was perfectly with the
[28:12] scripture but not in the way they knew
[28:15] it what size would you have took see now
[28:18] your life that you live now reflects now
[28:22] just what their name because you still
[28:25] are possessed with the same spirit amen
[28:28] if you take that side down with the amp
[28:30] you to Jonathan because the Same Spirit
[28:33] that's in you now within people man see
[28:37] the devil never takes the spirit it just
[28:39] goes off of one man on to another God
[28:40] never takes his spirit either it goes
[28:43] from one to the heavens so the very
[28:45] Spirit was upon Elijah come upon Elisha
[28:48] same one on John the Baptist and so
[28:50] forth the Holy Spirit was up on Christ
[28:52] come upon the disciples all that are
[28:54] still upon the people you see God's ever
[28:56] takes his spirit so there we are left to
[28:59] make a charge and I I can't see you were
[29:02] Paul was regretting uh anything and
[29:07] saying he was sorry he was a prisoner
[29:10] but he's addressing yourself I believe
[29:12] that Paul as he wrote this letter
[29:15] with us
[29:19] [Music]
[30:09] thank you
