[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] and this David a man after God's Own Heart had 500 watts see what I mean David with his 500 wives Solomon with his thousand and Solomon is the son of David in the natural which represents Jesus Christ the son of David and the spiritual but that's natural sex life this is going to be spiritual created why created amen that's the way it was at the beginning but not now in this life we live in now notice don't fail this now take it all down to your hearts but not one of those women could even have one more husband amen he's original creation not her not one of those women could have one more husband but that one husband could have a thousand wives that's thus stay at the large that's the Bible now I've went back took my time and showed you back I don't know what started what Jesus said now do you see it clearly they could have as many oh you say that was just for Israel is it when Abraham took Sarah down into the Philistine country there was a king down there named Emily and Sarah was 100 years old right at it but she had been changed back to a young woman and been made beautiful you know that all right an amalek wanted her for a wife you remember my message on it amalek wanted to take Sarah for a wife probably had a harem but he could not take her if she was married to Abraham so Abraham said to Sarah say that you are my brother because he'll kill me so that he can have you why don't you just Chase Abraham out of the country and take his wife him alone not only Allah was it with Believers but to all people in the creation Center our Sanctuary responsible man for these acts there was a heathen King how many knows that story is true it's a Bible Genesis about 16th chapter I think you noticed Emily would have Tucker for a wife he fixed himself to have this new Hebrew girl and he said this is my she said that's my brother he said that's my sister and everybody said I'll just take her for a wife and could you imagine a man doing a thing like that but it did it and then that night while he went to sleep the Lord appeared to me a dream and said amlik you're as good as a dead man he's protecting that that stream of Jewish blood there you see he said you're as good as a dead man you've got another man's wife you're fixing to marry he said Lord you know the Integrity of my heart said did not she tell me that was her brother did not he himself say that's my sister he said I know the Integrity of your heart that is the reason I wouldn't permit you to sin against me is that right said restore his wife prophet and unless you taking back his wife and let him pray for you not your priest if he don't pray for you a whole nation's gone amen there's Amazing Grace your whole nation's gone that's that man's wife and he's my prophet amen that's thus saith the Lord that's a scripture now we find out death was caused death is the cause of sin of the woman come to the woman and not the man by her way of living her life and by her all death comes her way of giving life is death how many knows that Job 14 if you want to put down the scripture God if you question this I got scripture go down for every bit of this if you don't read Job 14 it says man that is born of woman is of a few days and full of trouble is that Ryan you cometh up like the flower each cut down and waste away and so forth see uh every man that's born of a woman is born in death as soon as he comes but when he's born into the creation of God he cannot die he's in that other tree that was in the Garden of Eden Christ eternal life come by the tree or you say she was a tree Shore well he said thou shall not take of this tree God said in Genesis back there thou shall not take of this tree while the woman is the tree she's a fruit tree you're the fruit of your mother the fruit of the womb as you that's right and then the fruit of the tree of life that was in the Garden of Eden is Christ through the woman come death to the man in the original creation come life the be born of woman is death be born of Christ's life get the hottie that's where now you see where the goddesses went to don't you first Adam and Eve type the second Adam and Eve see the multiplication now the multiplication of Adam and Eve was through sex to replenish the Earth but it wasn't so at the beginning God just made a male and a female like he did his other creatures see legal just like the church now let us in view of these Vindicated truths of God search a little further if you want to all right now this may hurt just a little bit till we get down to the bottom of it I'm just going to show you the truth of it there is no Minister that can marry a widow do you know that you want to read that aren't you getting Leviticus Leviticus 21 7 and Ezekiel 44 22. it'll show you that the priesthood was not to marry a woman that's been touched by man this type is of the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ because they handle the fire of God the priesthood Aaron's sons we haven't got time to read it all and get out but noon we got 20 minutes yet and that was Aaron's sons of the Handler the the fire of God so they could not marry a woman that had been touched by another man the unchanging God said so they could not marry another woman at a woman being touched by a man showing and type here if you want to see it that's the Church of the Living God is purely unadulterated the word of God and not a denomination has been handled by man no let's read this show I want to get this to you Matthew 5 Jesus spoke here of something really of a vital importance we want to see it Matthew 5. I wrote on my I marked out some of the things I was going to say just to the man so I've had quite a little time saying it just before our sisters but I want to go out here now before now sister I want to put you into the place where God's word promised you and you see them you stay in that place too Matthew 5 32 I want you to know sure to support this same idea of one in many Matthew 30 uh I think it's Matthew 5 32. 31 to begin with it has been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement us Jesus speaking once said from the beginning now watch but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving the cause of fornications causes her to commit adultery see whosoever shall put away his wife saving the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery wash your Mary again and whosoever married her and is divorced committed adultery see she's got a living husband so no man can marry her care what she does and who she is she's got a living husband there's no grounds for her at all but it's not for him causes her not him get it you have to make the word run in continuity see nothing's saying he couldn't but she can't causes her not him that's exactly what the Bible says causes her it is not stated against him to remarry but her why Christ and the type notice it is stated that he cannot remarry only a virgin he can remarry he can he can remarry again if it's a virgin but he can't marry somebody else's wife no one needy and if he does marry a divorced woman he is living in adultery I don't care who he is the Bible said whosoever marries her that is put away liveth in adultery there you are not no divorces see that Regional back to her from the beginning now remarrying now notice he can but she can't like David like Solomon like the continuity of the whole Bible now same as David and the rest of them now you notice in First Corinthians 7 10 notice Paul commands the wife that is that divorces her husband to remain single or be reconciled not to remarry she must remain single or to be uh reconciled back to your husband she cannot remarry she must remain single but notice he never said about the man see you can't make the word lie from the beginning the sex law by polygamy now the word of God runs true with nature of God runs into continuity see how there is one school went East and the other went West on it you got to come back to the truth to find out what it is it's always been that way that's a regular Covenant with God from the beginning first before the beginning from the beginning there's just one in one after the sin came in then there was one man and a bunch of women run that way in nature every animal and human beings and natural flesh is animal we're a mammal we know that all of us see it's all God's nature and continuity but now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth directs us to the word that explains why all the mistakes has been down to the ages because the seals was not open this was not revealed that's true notice you you can't make the Shadows fail as I preached to you last night about the shadow across the floor it's got to come out right [Music] how could there be a shadow of an elephant coming across the floor and a little bitty spindly man come out to be the elephant or the elephant's a little spindly man now if you'll notice it in perfect time now there is a true woman a true woman virgin that marries her husband and lives that she's a blessed thing to the man if God could have given his son any better thing than a wife he would have given to him but she's designed to be a sex act and no other animal is designed like that no other creature on the earth is designed like that that's the reason you see polygamy because of that that's what brought it in now look in the final analysis look there is one Jesus Christ is that right amen one man God Emmanuel you believe that but the members of his wife are many amen thousands times thousands of thousands is that right his why the bride the church you understand now that's why he said to Adam before sex was ever induced are introduced multiply to replenish the Earth when he was yet in the beginning when he was yet both male and female in himself their shoes and that the bride's got to come from the word the spiritual multiplication multiplications see replenishing the Earth now in the sex acts see the schools got those two things mixed up therefore you can't do it you've got to bring it back to the truth of it in the beginning and at the end there will be one Lord Jesus and his bride many singular you get it there was one David on one throne one king after God's Own Heart with 500 wives all right right Jesus setting on his throne Hallelujah in the Millennium with the wife like it was at the beginning created out of the Earth by the hand of almighty God in the resurrection of many members there you are women struggle to be that come into Christ then you'll not be in that filthy mess out there but as long as you're just a church member trying to live morally good yourself you'll never make it neither can a man make it outside of Christ as Paul went on to say but they're in Christ there is neither male or female they're all one but to get this marriage in divorce straightened out so that you would know which was right and which was wrong now he plainly shows her in these times there is one Christ and many members of that wife notice he can put us away for our spiritual fornications and false Doctrine anytime he wants to but how dare you try to put him away and make it the man can put away his wife and marry another but not the woman put away her husband and marry another see all the shadows and types there perfectly balanced them the original creation not the byproduct nowhere not the church the bride to the word not the woman the man each time that's which never says anything against the man doing it it's always the woman exactly but she can be the bride of Christ by being and remember she being a part of a man the Bible said she can own nevertheless I suffer not a woman to teach or to serve any Authority but to be in silence for Adam was first form then even Adam was not deceived but the byproduct was deceived now we're standing she shall be saved if she continues and Holiness and sobriety and in childbearing and all such because then she becomes a part of this man that's what bring why didn't Abraham why didn't God kill Sarah sitting right there the night of God sitting there as a mortal man eating flesh eating bread drinking milk and he said why did Sarah laugh back there in the back behind him in the Tina never seen her saying these to how can these things be she said I never said it oh my God tell God he's a liar to his face but he couldn't take her why she's a part of Abraham he couldn't hurt her without hurting Abraham now you women see where you belong and the Bible said you women be like Sarah was which adorned herself in modest apparel live honest and true to her own husband loving him so much that he she called him her Lord ruler ownership and you some of the women put on these nasty clothes eat out here to throw yourself before man Jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart then who's guilty the man or you he's a male made so he could take this act see and you're the female that ought to refuse now why do you put yourself out like that it ain't for comfort you know what can't be when your half froze to death for them shorts on it can't be for comfort and what is it is for Filth you won't admit it but it's the Bible says so amen it's the truth it's a filthy Spirit that's in you you don't want to be filthy but you don't realize spiritually you are filthy because you're presenting yourself filthy now a man is old dirty naughty knees and if he had on hardly any clothes all we're making difference his body's not tempting why he was in the original creation character should be but you're the byproduct to tempt by God have mercy on my this sinful world I'll be glad when it's over notice he can put away his wife anytime he wants to but she can't put him away he can make me he can throw me in the dust anytime he takes an ocean to you but oh brother I better try and throw him there I'm finished Solomon can marry any woman that wasn't married he can marry any woman he wanted to a priest could marry only a woman that was a virgin Solomon like David he married uh what was her name Abigail which says a man called a fool he had a nice wife and he died and Abigail was married to David he was a king not a priest thing so he he married but a priest could not do that because it touched a god a woman to be his wife that was already been some man's wife so that shows the urgency of the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ the bridal had to be unadulterated the word not one word missing nowhere certainly could you imagine a correct bride one breast off and the other something other wrong you know that's not going to be the bride of Christ she's perfect She's Everything the word not one word failing anywhere no notice he can put her away but she cannot put him away he did it and proved it in the days when Luther Wesley and Pentecost when they refused to become the further part of him by having spiritual sexual Affair to become pregnant with further part of the word you understand she refused the Lutheran Church refused for Christ to have any more Desire with her Luther refused it let me say this I'm going to call me something anyhow so is it the day with every one of them they fail to take that word they refuse Christ and any woman that refuses a man is child has no right to be alive to him man you remember the Bible when the King married Esther because the queen refused he just got him another one and when the what happened when she refused to come out with the King obeying the same thing it is with a woman that refuses to be white to her husband so is it with the church that refuses to become pregnated in the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age we are not lutherans we're not Wesley's neither are we Pentecostals we've got to be the children of this age to the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth a child of this age the sea child amen I hope you understand couldn't be pregnant and no so what did he do put her away in divorcement it's Ryan but she dares put him away he put her away he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating him saying by himself his children began to go look more like him because it's fully mature or they become children of the word not children of the church Children of the word and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made Theory should be purely unadulterated Bride of the word amen amen I hope you get that out on the air she'll be the impregnated daughter of God see what a great honor a woman can be see what a great thing the church can be but you see where filth has got her to then trying to compare that church out there with the church here you can't do and trying to come out the street hearted with the Church of the Living God or the woman the correct woman with a harlot why is there such things as that it's a law of God a contrast how will we know how to enjoy the daylight if there was a night how do we know how to enjoy the dry weather if there wasn't rain how would we normally enjoy and respect a real woman if there was a dirty one right on revealing it right revealing his word but dare any one of us to try to put away him and marry another now surely it's plain why both theories are wrong you can't make it run this way it's gone you make it run that run from a past the promise here's the promise here's the thing right here the word is not contradictory it has to stay in continuity now no more than Matthew 28 19 contradicts Acts 2 38. now some of you women some of you man uh I know you're you're disagreeing with it because you know you can't hide that right now you can but let me just show you something if Matthew 28 19 said go ye therefore teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost and they turned around and every person has ever baptized was baptized contrary to that baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the for even all through the Bible agent for 300 years after the Bible age to the nicia council then the adopted dogmas instead what's the difference if it isn't revealed and you know the whole book the whole Bible is a revelation that's how you have to go the truth between this and and yeah
