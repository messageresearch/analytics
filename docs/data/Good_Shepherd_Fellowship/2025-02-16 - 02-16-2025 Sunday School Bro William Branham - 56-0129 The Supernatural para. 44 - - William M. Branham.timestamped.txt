[0:03] [Music]
[1:25] to her
[1:26] mistress she said uh I would God that my
[1:33] Lord Nan was over in my country for we
[1:38] have a prophet over there that could
[1:41] heal him of his leprosy oh
[1:44] my how God used that
[1:49] child how did she know the same thing I
[1:53] was talking on I about
[1:55] inspiration from that any atmosphere
[2:00] now notice that child under inspiration
[2:04] was led to say those words we don't know
[2:07] if Elijah ever healing anyone else and
[2:09] maybe no one else no matter how many you
[2:11] prayed for but she said I would to God
[2:15] that my Lord was over with my country
[2:18] for in my country we have a
[2:22] prophet oh if we can say that about our
[2:25] churches
[2:26] today I would to God
[2:31] that you could come under the influence
[2:33] that I live under and my church lives
[2:36] under for we believe that God Is A
[2:39] Healer we believe that God is a savior
[2:42] we believe that God gives the Holy
[2:45] Spirit and I would you God that you
[2:48] lived in my
[2:51] country notice quickly when entered into
[2:55] a place like that where The
[2:57] Supernaturals introduced name once sent
[3:00] to his King and he wrote a letter over
[3:03] to the other king he said surely now if
[3:05] there's a great thing like that going on
[3:07] over there and that country the king
[3:09] should know about it if there is a
[3:11] prophet in the land the king would know
[3:14] about it sure the high UPS should know
[3:17] about it see that's still the carnal
[3:20] mind the little girl never said a word
[3:22] about the king she spoke about the
[3:25] prophet amen oh I hope you see it
[3:31] she spoke of the
[3:35] Prophet maybe she never seen a case of
[3:37] ersy heal but she knows where someone
[3:39] lives under that atmosphere of the
[3:43] supernatural but if he was over there
[3:46] something take
[3:47] place but here goes the King on the
[3:50] roundabout way or namon going through
[3:53] the king and to day you speak they said
[3:55] I belong to the church oh M that has
[3:59] nothing to do with the atmosphere not a
[4:02] thing notice and he brings the letter
[4:05] over to the king of Israel and looks
[4:07] like today if there was a prophet in the
[4:09] land if there was healing in the land
[4:11] that the up and UPS would know it God
[4:14] doesn't always deal with the up and
[4:16] up we are an individual
[4:20] Kingdom speaking of someone the day by
[4:23] polygamy I said the nation whole would
[4:25] be better off if it practiced
[4:27] pgy it would we're the highest rated
[4:31] nation in the world was
[4:32] divorces marrying and Inter Maring
[4:35] marrying and Inter Maring because we
[4:37] tried to make the man of the world
[4:42] outside coincides with Christian
[4:44] doctrine and you can't put the nature of
[4:47] a lamb in a
[4:50] pig believe better off for him I believe
[4:53] God look at pgy and excuse a lot quicker
[4:55] than what he would I remember don't you
[4:57] said I believe in pgy I don't
[5:00] Our God said Moses
[5:03] said the Pharisees said that Jesus said
[5:06] why did Moses suffer right verse that he
[5:08] did it because the hardness of your
[5:10] heart right but it wasn't so from the
[5:14] beginning never will be God did it
[5:17] because of the hardness of their heart
[5:20] but in the Nations where they have pgy
[5:22] their divorce courts are at Ed
[5:25] low but in here where we're trying to
[5:28] make and govern in this country as a
[5:30] nation because being a Christian Nation
[5:33] but the name of Christian Nation doesn't
[5:35] make it a Christian Nation and you
[5:37] cannot govern the World by the rules of
[5:41] God you can I have no nothing against a
[5:45] sinner drinking I have nothing against a
[5:49] sinner committing
[5:50] adul nothing against a sinner doing this
[5:54] but what I'm talking about is these
[5:56] people who are supposed to be Christians
[5:58] and then doing that if the pig wants to
[6:02] stick his snout in the manure pile and
[6:03] eat all day that's his business cuz he's
[6:06] a pig to begin
[6:09] with but the lamb doesn't do
[6:13] that the CER a pig to begin
[6:17] with but then when you try to make a
[6:19] lamb out of a pig he has to have a
[6:22] conversion and he has to come into a
[6:24] different atmosphere and when he comes
[6:26] into the atmosphere his desires will
[6:28] change and his nature will
[6:32] change that's the way it is
[6:34] today so he goes to the king and has a
[6:38] letter this letter is I just don't like
[6:42] it as the Baptist Church the people say
[6:45] anybody want to come in by profession or
[6:48] bring your letter or the change of a
[6:50] letter remove a
[6:51] letter pack it from one Church to the
[6:54] other just about as much influence in it
[6:57] as there is when this King Nam taking
[7:00] this king of Israel his
[7:02] letter what's that got to do with God
[7:06] God isn't going to come to the church
[7:07] and look up your letter he's got a book
[7:10] in Heaven All The Book of Life and if
[7:14] your name's not on this book of life
[7:16] you're lost if you got a letter in every
[7:17] Church in the world
[7:22] right and your name will never be
[7:24] written there unless you come into that
[7:26] atmosphere living and loving with God
[7:29] God is a loving God he wants to be loved
[7:32] you can't be cold cruel and indifferent
[7:34] and ever get anywhere with
[7:36] God you got to be loving and kind notice
[7:41] and this little lady she had told him to
[7:43] go to the prophet but said the prophet
[7:45] he went over to the king and the King
[7:47] didn't know nothing about Divine Healing
[7:49] he didn't know anything about certain
[7:51] certain things they didn't know that
[7:53] there was a prophet in the land that
[7:55] could perform Miracles he didn't know
[7:57] nothing about though he was supposed to
[7:58] be an Israelite ch CCIS but to see his
[8:02] atmosphere wasn't like Elijah's
[8:06] atmosphere and when he got this letter
[8:09] he reached and got his garments and tore
[8:10] him up said am I
[8:13] God to make man alive or to kill he said
[8:18] I want all of you his cabinet I want all
[8:21] of you to take notice this man's picking
[8:23] a quel with
[8:25] me that's it see the world only car
[8:31] up see he didn't live under the yet he
[8:33] was a professed Israelite but he thought
[8:35] the days of Miracles has passed but oh
[8:38] thank God there was an old Prophet lived
[8:42] out there in the wilderness who Liv with
[8:44] God under different
[8:47] atmosphere he heard the king toore his
[8:49] cloth up he said why did you tear your
[8:52] clothes up say why didn't you send him
[8:55] out here to me you know where there was
[8:58] a prophet in Israel or not
[9:01] the king didn't know it there's many
[9:03] people today that doesn't know that
[9:04] Jesus Christ is still alive they don't
[9:07] know that he still rules and Reigns they
[9:10] don't know that the blood of Calvary for
[9:13] the for the alls sufficient see that he
[9:16] he was purchased there at the cross for
[9:18] your transgressions and for your healing
[9:20] they don't know that's real today we
[9:23] need some more Little Maids to go around
[9:24] and testify of these things don't you
[9:27] think
[9:28] so get in the atmosphere of it it's not
[9:31] afraid what the world says because while
[9:33] they're talking with the world they're
[9:35] still in another
[9:36] atmosphere you're talking to the siner
[9:38] but you're not in his atmosphere and
[9:40] you're in such a glorious and shrouded
[9:42] in them Shina Glory all around you in
[9:45] the veils of the whhe you can talk to
[9:47] the worldly women or the worldly man or
[9:49] whoever it is and still live in that
[9:50] shakina Glory telling of of a loving God
[9:53] that's raised from the
[9:56] dead a few weeks ago
[9:59] I was in Carl through Germany the church
[10:04] down there which is a from swingley not
[10:06] a Lutheran but they had I went in Billy
[10:10] Grim was there one night at Zurich and I
[10:13] went in the next day and my
[10:16] advertisement and Billy Grims was
[10:18] setting together Billy Grim has a place
[10:20] in my heart as a true servant of God he
[10:24] preaches repentance and he's doing a
[10:26] very fine job at it God is using him we
[10:28] know that there and he was had a meeting
[10:32] there and that day I didn't get to the
[10:33] meeting though I had an invitation to
[10:35] come set in the box but I was so tired
[10:38] and worn from a long flight around the
[10:41] country for several thousands of miles
[10:43] in a plane I was wore out and I went
[10:46] into the room and I went in to lie down
[10:49] and I I went to sleep and it was too
[10:51] late so I reached over and turned the
[10:52] radio and I heard him preaching to the
[10:55] translator and the next morning when the
[10:57] newspapers come I see what a RAC and
[11:00] they give Billy Graham the church denied
[11:03] the main body of church they ever
[11:04] invited such a person to their
[11:06] nation and they said that he put a
[11:09] manicure in his hair what is or or wave
[11:12] that you know what did you call it um
[11:14] permanent that is permanent and in his
[11:16] hair and he said when he come through
[11:18] the platform to preach he looked like he
[11:20] was going to a band box instead of a
[11:22] servant of God going to not a wrinkle in
[11:24] his
[11:25] clothes and they said that when he's
[11:28] preaching that he's screaming and waved
[11:30] his arms like a fantastic soap salesman
[11:32] from America and said his perfume was so
[11:36] great that you could smell in 10 ft away
[11:39] he preached on the Supreme deity of the
[11:41] Lord Jesus Christ and I knew what I was
[11:44] in for then but I had 10 days
[11:48] there see the church in Zurich in
[11:51] Switzerland and Germany does not believe
[11:53] that Jesus is the son of God they say
[11:56] he's the son of Joseph called the Son of
[11:58] God that knocked the very Foundation
[12:01] from under Christianity he was a virgin
[12:03] born son of the Living God and Billy G
[12:07] never held any strength he preached it
[12:09] that way yes sir and I knew I'd follow
[12:12] right up behind
[12:13] him and in there God gave us that
[12:17] ungodly Place another morning you think
[12:19] the Millennium is struck there the
[12:20] Chimes and bells on the churches and yet
[12:24] they called Billy Graham a soap salesman
[12:26] and me a
[12:27] souser you can know what kind of an
[12:30] atmosphere they're living in John went
[12:33] forth preaching
[12:34] repentance then they act to the root of
[12:37] the tree he did no Miracles Jesus come
[12:39] behind him not preaching but Healing The
[12:42] Sick and Performing
[12:44] Miracles they said if they called him
[12:47] who come John said he had a devil
[12:49] because he didn't eat and drink the son
[12:51] of man a gluttonous and a friend of
[12:52] siners wisdom is Justified of her
[12:56] children and today to seeing their own
[12:59] country Jesus Christ coming forth in
[13:01] John as a prophet like John Billy G
[13:04] preaching repentance and then come back
[13:06] around in an old fashion campaign the
[13:08] heal the sick and prophecy and all the
[13:11] different signs and wonders it's still
[13:12] the same ungodly Pharisee spirit that
[13:16] lives out under a church atmosphere
[13:17] instead of under the shakina
[13:19] glory amen God forgive me if I say
[13:22] something
[13:23] wrong you see what I mean they don't
[13:26] believe we moved on up into Carl through
[13:28] after having 50,000 of those cold formal
[13:31] people kneel at an altar and give their
[13:32] heart to God and receive the Holy Ghost
[13:35] moved on up into Carl's Drew in the
[13:37] church sent word up there right quick
[13:39] don't let him come up
[13:41] there see don't permit it and they
[13:44] couldn't find any stadiums and things so
[13:46] the man got together and built a place
[13:48] covered several Acres of ground and
[13:49] spread canvas over like a big Cathedral
[13:52] and thousands times thousands poured in
[13:54] there the first night because they count
[13:56] as many as 180 and 200 buses every night
[13:58] from from Germany and from Belgium and
[14:00] all around coming into the Zur meeting
[14:03] and when we were went up there quickly
[14:05] they said Dr G and be my representative
[14:07] there one up there and he said no the
[14:10] police said he cannot come said you had
[14:13] Billy Grim what about him we have orders
[14:15] not to receive him from the church and
[14:17] church control State too if you in Z in
[14:20] Switzerland or Germany either one church
[14:22] and States together the church is over
[14:23] the state and Church in state United so
[14:27] they couldn't do it druki be went out he
[14:29] said God it can't be so you led brother
[14:33] brandom up here and he wouldn't have
[14:35] come unless you let him so there's got
[14:36] to be something happened God I was off
[14:40] resting I said yes the Lord speaks to me
[14:42] to go to
[14:43] Germany he said God something wrong it
[14:46] seemed like living in that atmosphere
[14:49] not a vision not a voice but something
[14:51] down his soul said this is the American
[14:54] zone go down to the American
[14:56] headquarters and he went in there to the
[14:58] major
[15:00] and the major he went and said major I'm
[15:02] Dr guki be from Missour switzland which
[15:04] is an attorney which has Nationwide
[15:08] publicity and and loyalty to the nation
[15:11] he said and we have a brother from
[15:13] America comes over here to preach for us
[15:16] and said we have built a great Cathedral
[15:18] out here for him and said up at Hamburg
[15:21] we going to have it in the stadium but
[15:22] the weather's too rainy and we had to
[15:23] put this place up here Carl's R which
[15:25] means Carl's rest and he said we we have
[15:29] brought him over here now and he feels
[15:31] that he should come here and the church
[15:33] has denied us the privilege of letting
[15:34] our brother come so they had Billy Grim
[15:36] up here and said they let him come now
[15:38] what's wrong with our brother coming he
[15:41] said well I think if they let Mr Grim
[15:43] come they ought to let your brother come
[15:45] and of course that's American Controls
[15:47] you know so he said but I'll tell you he
[15:49] said they won't let him come so what do
[15:51] they have against your your preacher for
[15:53] coming said father why do you don't want
[15:55] him to come he said kind sir he said
[15:58] here's the reason he said because that
[16:00] our brother prays for the sick and gets
[16:02] a result and they're against the
[16:04] supernatural of God he said what's your
[16:06] brother's name said brother brand he
[16:08] said brother
[16:09] Brandon he said he prayed for my mother
[16:12] and she was taking from a wheelchair in
[16:14] Virginia hallu don't tell him it's open

[16:27] throne you he was your leading move to
[16:30] it get in the atmosphere and follow the
[16:33] way that mooves it goes east or west
[16:36] move the first night a bunch of
[16:38] communist got on the outside of the
[16:41] place and they was routed in the bushes
[16:42] with guns to shoot me they said when
[16:45] went out German soldiers pledging their
[16:47] loyalty come around and held their arms
[16:49] over me and around around me till they
[16:50] got in the car one almost got my son
[16:53] Billy before he got through the car a
[16:55] fanatic and the next night standing in
[16:58] the building there were the Holy Spirit
[17:00] moving I couldn't even call the German
[17:02] names to the people in the audience have
[17:04] to spell it out and tell them they seem
[17:06] the working there said a medium sitting
[17:08] over there with his eyes cast on he said
[17:10] I'll come down and said I'll make him to
[17:13] know he told him that day he said I'll
[17:15] call a storm out of the skies and he
[17:18] said I'll cause it to tear that place
[17:20] down and the Thunder The Roaring of
[17:22] lightning of flashing as hard as it
[17:24] could in here com he made his threats
[17:25] and roll it out now turning didn't
[17:28] didn't matter to me what he said and
[17:30] when I seen the storm coming and people
[17:31] get nervous and one constant roll of
[17:33] lightning after the other and like that

[17:48] jambers and jambus with stood Moses so
[17:51] these the Antichrist having power to
[17:54] perform Miracles but you're afraid to
[17:56] touch the supernatural of God right I
[18:00] said because you done this you'll pay
[18:02] for it they packed him out that night as
[18:04] a and while we were there in a
[18:06] storm going on I just contined with my
[18:08] message I kept calling to God in my
[18:10] heart and after a while about 10 minutes
[18:13] the storm cleared away and to shine out
[18:15] real pretty the Lord Jesus wow the
[18:19] people got into the atmosphere when they
[18:21] seen the glory of God begin to
[18:24] move at that time they started the
[18:26] prayer line and they were lifting the
[18:29] people to the platform coming and I

[18:34] little girl to the platform out of

[21:02] trying to direct her in that country
[21:05] they had to get a man who could speak
[21:07] their language to give out their prayer
[21:08] card and so he wasn't very well trained
[21:11] and he let the little girls go to walk
[21:13] off he just picked her up there on the
[21:14] platform she's about the third or the
[21:16] fourth one on the platform and I look
[21:19] she's near the edge of the platform

[21:24] when I look she I reached and grabbed
[21:26] her like that and The Interpreter to
[21:28] talk to her and she was mumbling off
[21:30] something she said I want to meet the
