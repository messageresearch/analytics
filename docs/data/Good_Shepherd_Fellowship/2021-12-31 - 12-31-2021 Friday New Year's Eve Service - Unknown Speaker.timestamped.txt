[55:14] encourage your children
[55:16] in the name of jesus father we pray with
[55:18] thanksgiving

[56:09] sin
[56:10] which do have so easily beside us
[56:12] and let us run with patience the race

[56:27] it's good to see every one of
[56:28] you and god richly bless you all
[56:34] whenever one told me
[56:36] you have 20 25 minutes i was wondering
[56:39] what i was coming to say here
[56:42] um because i'm not good at time
[56:47] when i have too much time i use less
[56:51] and when i have less time i use more
[56:56] it's not deliberate
[56:57] that is what tall men do
[57:00] so
[57:03] maybe next time brother once you look at
[57:06] the height of the people and then
[57:07] [Music]
[57:10] praise be to god
[57:12] yes so tonight
[57:15] 20 minutes
[57:19] i just want us to encourage ourselves
[57:22] as we are entering the new year
[57:26] the very last portions of the scripture
[57:28] we just read
[57:30] 12th one
[57:32] says
[57:36] and let us run with patience
[57:39] the race
[57:40] that is set before us
[57:43] in fact if i have to title this at all
[57:46] i will just say
[57:49] let us run
[57:51] with patience
[57:53] praise be to god amen let us run
[57:56] with patience
[57:58] as we are entering the new year
[58:00] sorry i have to bring my phone up here
[58:02] is something i don't like doing i was
[58:04] trying to print something i couldn't
[58:06] just get it to work
[58:07] so
[58:08] in any case it's a mute
[58:10] so i promise you this phone will not
[58:12] rain until i live here
[58:14] so brother branham said
[58:18] in the exposition of seven church ages
[58:21] chapter 8 the philadelphian church
[58:24] he said revelation 3 10
[58:27] because thou has kept the word
[58:31] of my patience
[58:33] i also will keep thee from the hour of
[58:35] temptation
[58:37] we shall come upon all the world
[58:40] to try them that dwell upon the earth
[58:44] what does
[58:46] he mean
[58:47] by the word
[58:49] of my patience
[58:50] hebrews 3 hebrews 6 13 to 15.
[58:55] for when god made
[58:57] promise to abraham
[58:59] because he could swear by no greater he
[59:02] swept by himself saying
[59:04] surely
[59:07] blessing i will bless thee
[59:09] and multiplying i will multiply thee
[59:13] and so after he had patiently endured
[59:16] he obtained a promise
[59:19] you see
[59:20] the spirit is speaking about the word of
[59:23] god which is given to us
[59:26] to wait for the fulfillment
[59:28] of that word required patience
[59:31] even as it did in the case of abraham
[59:34] i don't know i have not timed myself
[59:38] it is just
[59:40] 9 18
[59:41] we can run it off to 9 20
[59:44] just for you know to make it easy for me
[59:46] to calculate
[59:48] praise be to god
[59:52] yes
[59:54] so um
[59:56] yes he endured as seeing
[59:59] him who is invisible
[1:00:02] he was patient
[1:00:05] and then the word finally was fulfilled
[1:00:09] this is the way god teaches his people
[1:00:12] patience
[1:00:13] why
[1:00:14] if he fulfilled his word
[1:00:17] in physical manifestations
[1:00:20] the very instant you prayed
[1:00:23] you would never lend patience
[1:00:27] but would become even more impatient
[1:00:29] with life
[1:00:31] yes i was just thinking about it
[1:00:34] if you prayed and god answered your
[1:00:36] prayer right there and then
[1:00:38] you but abraham said you will never lend
[1:00:41] patience
[1:00:42] as a matter of fact you'll be very
[1:00:44] impatient
[1:00:48] you know when you look at
[1:00:51] faith
[1:00:52] the substance of things hoped for i am
[1:00:55] not preaching tonight
[1:00:57] i just i'm just speaking
[1:00:59] if you look at the substance of things
[1:01:02] hoped for
[1:01:03] the evidence of things not seen
[1:01:07] when you pray
[1:01:09] between the time you pray
[1:01:12] and the time you see the physical
[1:01:13] manifestation
[1:01:15] of the prayer there is time
[1:01:20] and that is where faith counts
[1:01:24] if you prayed and right there and then
[1:01:27] you see the result that is good we all
[1:01:29] like that
[1:01:31] but faith
[1:01:34] the evidence of things hoped for
[1:01:37] substance of things hopefully the
[1:01:39] evidence of this not seen
[1:01:42] you have prayed
[1:01:43] and you have believed it
[1:01:45] yet you have not seen it
[1:01:48] and you have believed that god has
[1:01:50] restored your ear
[1:01:52] and you are walking with one ear in the
[1:01:54] street
[1:01:55] and people are making fun of you and you
[1:01:57] tell them no the ear is there and they
[1:01:59] say but we don't see they are making fun
[1:02:01] of you and you keep believing that is
[1:02:04] why faith counts
[1:02:07] and i like this so very much
[1:02:09] when the prophet himself is saying that
[1:02:11] if god answered your prayer right there
[1:02:13] and then
[1:02:14] you'll be very very impatient in life
[1:02:17] let me show you
[1:02:19] this truth even more fully set forth in
[1:02:22] hebrews 11 17 by faith abraham when he
[1:02:26] was tried offered up isaac and he that
[1:02:29] had received the promises the word of
[1:02:32] god offered up his only begotten son
[1:02:34] there it is abraham
[1:02:37] was
[1:02:37] tried after he received the word of
[1:02:40] promise
[1:02:41] must
[1:02:42] think
[1:02:43] must think that as soon as we pray in
[1:02:46] jesus name over the good promises of god
[1:02:49] that there could not be a trial
[1:02:53] but there it is that abraham was tried
[1:02:57] after he received the promise
[1:03:00] that is exactly correct according to
[1:03:02] samus to the psalmist referring to
[1:03:04] joseph
[1:03:06] psalm 105 19 until the time that
[1:03:10] his word came
[1:03:12] the word of the lord tried him
[1:03:15] god gives us exceeding great precious
[1:03:19] promises
[1:03:20] he has promised to fulfill them he will
[1:03:24] but from the time we prayed until the
[1:03:26] time we got the answer
[1:03:28] we must learn to receive patience
[1:03:31] until our souls sorry into our souls
[1:03:35] for
[1:03:36] only in patience
[1:03:38] do we possess life
[1:03:42] praise be to god
[1:03:43] may god help us to learn this lesson
[1:03:46] even as
[1:03:47] we know the people
[1:03:50] of the safe
[1:03:51] age
[1:03:52] land patience
[1:03:54] we read the history of the lives of
[1:03:56] these christians what a contrast
[1:03:59] we see between their lives and ours
[1:04:03] for they were so patient
[1:04:05] and quiet and today we are all but
[1:04:09] overcome
[1:04:11] in impatience and haste
[1:04:16] in this day and age
[1:04:19] if you want the most impatient people
[1:04:23] you will think they are the people in
[1:04:24] the streets
[1:04:25] you will find them in the house of god
[1:04:29] very very impatient people are just so
[1:04:32] impatient with life
[1:04:34] on the highways
[1:04:38] sometimes when you are late for work you
[1:04:39] have a scores you can give a course you
[1:04:41] can give a reason
[1:04:43] but other times you are 30 minutes ahead
[1:04:45] of time and yet you just speed and then
[1:04:47] go and get to you go to the parking lot
[1:04:49] just to park and sit down there and do
[1:04:51] nothing
[1:04:52] sometimes you are driving behind
[1:04:54] somebody
[1:04:55] and they are just driving
[1:04:58] according to the speed limit and you are
[1:05:00] behind and you want to run them over
[1:05:03] praise be to god
[1:05:05] i see somebody smiling and looking
[1:05:06] somewhere praise be to god
[1:05:10] yes god have mercy
[1:05:12] yes yes
[1:05:14] and sometimes you get so impatient with
[1:05:16] them
[1:05:18] till when you are overtaking them you
[1:05:20] don't even go you look across
[1:05:22] and it's not to smile at them or to say
[1:05:24] hi
[1:05:26] i think all of us do it right
[1:05:29] sometimes you just catch them and you
[1:05:31] wish they just drove off the cliff
[1:05:34] you know
[1:05:35] i was listening to radio one time
[1:05:39] and i heard the presenter say something
[1:05:42] he said he was driving behind a guy
[1:05:45] and the man was so slow and he was so
[1:05:47] impatient
[1:05:49] but then when he looked at the number
[1:05:50] plate
[1:05:51] he saw a wounded warrior
[1:05:55] so
[1:05:56] one traffic cleared in the left lane and
[1:05:59] he came in there
[1:06:00] and he got to his window he slowed down
[1:06:03] a little and looked across and it was a
[1:06:05] very old man
[1:06:07] with prosthetics the artificial hand is
[1:06:09] that how you call it
[1:06:11] beautiful and he was driving with
[1:06:13] artificial hand and so when he saw it
[1:06:16] his heart dropped into his stomach
[1:06:18] he said oh my goodness
[1:06:23] we are so impatient with life
[1:06:27] learn to be patient with yourself
[1:06:31] learn to be patient with others
[1:06:34] and above all learn to be patient with
[1:06:37] god
[1:06:39] because when god is dealing with you
[1:06:42] you don't know the program of god
[1:06:45] you don't know how god works
[1:06:47] a lot of the times we try to explain it
[1:06:50] we try to explain the inexplicable
[1:06:54] and god is working just you are just a
[1:06:57] clay in his hand that he is breaking a
[1:06:59] piece here
[1:07:00] just trying to murder here more you
[1:07:03] there and you are there and you are
[1:07:04] shouting and you are yelling and you are
[1:07:06] complaining all day long
[1:07:10] so so so impatient
[1:07:14] very very impatient
[1:07:17] there was a story
[1:07:19] i'm left with 14 minutes
[1:07:22] praise be to god
[1:07:24] yes
[1:07:26] yes
[1:07:27] it was a very good reason there was a
[1:07:29] very good reason why but one made me to
[1:07:30] come first
[1:07:33] yes
[1:07:36] so
[1:07:38] there was a married couple
[1:07:41] they had stayed together for a while
[1:07:45] and god had not yet blessed them
[1:07:47] with a child
[1:07:50] so one day the man told his wife
[1:07:53] he said honey you know
[1:07:54] we've been together for a very long time
[1:07:57] and now god has not blessed us with any
[1:07:59] children and we are poor
[1:08:01] so you know what
[1:08:03] let me travel
[1:08:06] just go and then hustle somewhere
[1:08:08] come and then get you a decent home you
[1:08:11] know in the villages
[1:08:13] the roof will touch
[1:08:16] um
[1:08:17] sleep on
[1:08:18] you know these uh sometimes even the bed
[1:08:21] is sometimes even made of grass
[1:08:24] yeah sometimes cutting
[1:08:28] and then you lie on it for so many years
[1:08:31] and then you are lying on it that part
[1:08:32] of you is up part of you is down
[1:08:36] i wonder how you get good sleep
[1:08:40] yes
[1:08:42] i slept on it a lot
[1:08:47] so so you know what i'll come and build
[1:08:48] your home
[1:08:50] and in all these village homes it's just
[1:08:54] sometimes there is no dog
[1:08:57] yes
[1:08:59] you know what i'm talking about sister
[1:09:02] so that the wife said okay i agree
[1:09:05] so this man left
[1:09:08] he found a very rich man
[1:09:11] and he told the rich man you know what
[1:09:13] you are taking care of me
[1:09:15] you have a place for me to sleep
[1:09:18] you give me food to eat the money you
[1:09:20] are going to pay me just keep it
[1:09:23] until i am ready to leave
[1:09:25] then you give it to me because i made my
[1:09:28] wife a promise
[1:09:29] that i would come back and build her
[1:09:31] home
[1:09:32] make her happy so this man agreed
[1:09:36] so he worked for seven years
[1:09:39] and then he was ready to go home
[1:09:41] and he told them man i am ready to go
[1:09:43] back
[1:09:44] then the man said you know what
[1:09:47] i would advise you to wait for seven
[1:09:49] more years
[1:09:52] is it seven more years
[1:09:54] at this point it looks like we are
[1:09:55] talking about jacob isn't it
[1:09:59] he said no it's too much you say you
[1:10:01] know what i have a very good reason
[1:10:04] if you can do it for seven more years
[1:10:06] in fact i am going to double your pay
[1:10:10] i want you to go back very happy
[1:10:13] it was very difficult because the man
[1:10:15] wanted to see his wife
[1:10:17] he said i choose to stay
[1:10:19] and then he stayed for another seven
[1:10:21] years
[1:10:23] and now
[1:10:24] 14 years
[1:10:26] away from his wife
[1:10:28] and when he got through
[1:10:31] the further that he was going to go
[1:10:34] his master came and sat with him
[1:10:36] thinking he was bringing the money
[1:10:38] and the master came with a very big bag
[1:10:42] with three loaves of bread
[1:10:45] very big lots of bread
[1:10:49] then the master said you have been a
[1:10:52] very very good servant to me
[1:10:55] i'm going to miss you a lot
[1:10:58] but you know what
[1:11:01] i want you to choose between the two
[1:11:05] either i give you your money
[1:11:08] or i'm going to give you an advice
[1:11:11] in place of the money
[1:11:15] he said what
[1:11:17] i have wait for 14 years
[1:11:20] and you give me an advice for money he
[1:11:22] said yes
[1:11:24] choose i'm not going to choose why but
[1:11:26] you choose
[1:11:31] but the man was so good to the servant
[1:11:34] so much so that
[1:11:36] he looked at him
[1:11:38] the father figure that he was to him
[1:11:41] so rich
[1:11:42] and amanda feared god he looked at him
[1:11:45] and he said you know what
[1:11:47] give me the advice
[1:11:50] then the man said okay
[1:11:53] i'm going to keep the money
[1:11:55] the advice is that
[1:11:57] learn to be patient in life
[1:12:01] the librarians have an adage
[1:12:04] that the patient dog
[1:12:06] is the fattest bone
[1:12:10] because
[1:12:12] back home the dogs we have
[1:12:19] they are very very good at math
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:24] i think every dog in africa
[1:12:31] if you ask them to calculate
[1:12:35] the area of a triangle they'll do it for
[1:12:38] you
[1:12:39] because your hand goes to the bowl they
[1:12:41] are looking at it
[1:12:42] you go to the soup they are looking at
[1:12:44] it you come to the mouth they are
[1:12:45] looking at it
[1:12:48] they don't give you a chance to eat
[1:12:52] so
[1:12:53] if you have
[1:12:55] a stubborn dog and he's doing that you
[1:12:57] think you give that dog the biggest bone
[1:12:58] no
[1:13:00] you reserve the big bone for the cool
[1:13:01] one
[1:13:02] that's what they mean the patient dog is
[1:13:05] the fattest bone
[1:13:06] and we have one in ghana they say if you
[1:13:08] have patience you can actually cook
[1:13:10] stone
[1:13:11] and drink the soup
[1:13:13] who cooks stone
[1:13:15] no one cooks stone
[1:13:16] all it means is that with patience
[1:13:20] the impulse the impossible things in
[1:13:22] life can become possible
[1:13:26] so the master said
[1:13:28] i'm keeping the money
[1:13:30] but be patient in life and with patience
[1:13:33] you are going to succeed that is all i
[1:13:35] have for you but take these three loaves
[1:13:37] of bread you are going to eat one on
[1:13:39] your way
[1:13:41] it is taking you three weeks to work i
[1:13:43] have eight minutes it is taking you
[1:13:45] three weeks to walk home
[1:13:47] i am giving you you are eating one loaf
[1:13:49] of bread
[1:13:50] the second one i will not tell you what
[1:13:52] happened to it but the third one keep it
[1:13:55] until you get home
[1:13:58] even if you are dying keep it till you
[1:14:01] get home
[1:14:02] and you will not eat it alone you are
[1:14:04] going to eat it with your wife
[1:14:09] he said good
[1:14:11] he took it when he left he said oh
[1:14:14] what just happened
[1:14:16] i worked for 14 years
[1:14:18] and all i have
[1:14:20] is just an advice be patient in life
[1:14:24] and you will succeed
[1:14:25] and three loaves of bread
[1:14:27] what has happened
[1:14:29] did i
[1:14:30] did i did that did i did i choose the
[1:14:32] writing
[1:14:33] and then he just left with his gallon of
[1:14:35] water
[1:14:36] just walked
[1:14:37] met other people they were all walking
[1:14:39] in the same direction
[1:14:41] between after the second week they
[1:14:43] relaxed somewhere in the night and
[1:14:46] people just came on horses
[1:14:48] surrounded the whole place
[1:14:51] and ransacked everything they had
[1:14:54] they took everything their money their
[1:14:57] their goals everything
[1:14:59] and when they got to him he said i have
[1:15:01] nothing
[1:15:02] they searched him there was nothing
[1:15:05] they said what do you have here it's a
[1:15:06] loaf of bread i worked for my master
[1:15:09] 14 years he sent me away with nothing
[1:15:13] he said oh
[1:15:14] they saw that he had started eating one
[1:15:16] already
[1:15:19] they said you know what
[1:15:21] um
[1:15:22] you are just a poor guy and then they
[1:15:24] took the second one
[1:15:27] so it was there now
[1:15:29] he said oh okay
[1:15:32] so that means if i had taken the money

[1:15:45] and you think you have a better option
[1:15:50] this journey we are traveling nobody has
[1:15:52] ever traveled this journey but one
[1:15:55] he knows the end from the beginning
[1:15:58] and the word of god says something and
[1:16:00] you want to give your own interpretation
[1:16:02] to it
[1:16:03] god tells you one thing and you want to
[1:16:04] do the other and you think you can
[1:16:07] outsmart god

[1:24:48] you see most of the time you hear people
[1:24:50] say god is trying my patient god is not
[1:24:53] trying your patient because you don't
[1:24:55] have patience
[1:24:57] you are not born with patience you don't
[1:24:59] have it
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:02] god is giving you he's teaching you

[1:25:40] james chapter 1 verse 3 says faith
[1:25:42] worketh
[1:25:44] passion
[1:25:46] when our faith is trying
[1:25:49] so what actually it is is god is trying
[1:25:52] his word in you
[1:25:55] and the triad of that word then produce
[1:25:58] a vector that is called patient
[1:26:01] praise the lord so it's all wrapped
[1:26:04] around god and his word
[1:26:06] and you have nothing to do with it
[1:26:09] god made a promise in his word
[1:26:11] and he's trying to bring that word to
[1:26:15] pass
[1:26:16] by putting you in a circumstance
[1:26:19] so that word can come to pass
[1:26:22] praise the lord that's all it's just god
[1:26:24] in his word and you are caught in the
[1:26:26] middle
[1:26:29] but because god do not fail
[1:26:32] his word is going to come to pass
[1:26:35] if you just surround there and say lord
[1:26:37] bring your word to pass in me
[1:26:40] but if you try to fight it
[1:26:42] then now it becomes more tougher because
[1:26:44] that word will still come to pass
[1:26:47] [Music]

[1:27:03] patient he said the first thing is

[1:27:10] having patience with god
[1:27:13] because it's god that is breaking his
[1:27:15] promise to pass there is no way you can
[1:27:19] force it to happen before
[1:27:22] the the time that god wanted to happen

[1:35:49] brother joseph armani
[1:35:51] joseph is
[1:35:52] is my is my middle name so but i prefer
[1:35:55] people to call me by joseph so
[1:35:57] but my first name is musha galusa
[1:36:00] my last name is armani so even at work
[1:36:02] everybody called me
[1:36:04] joseph because nobody can pronounce my
[1:36:06] first name correctly so i prefer just
[1:36:09] people call me
[1:36:10] joseph
[1:36:11] so
[1:36:13] uh i came from houston texas uh since uh
[1:36:17] february of this year
[1:36:19] and um
[1:36:20] after i finished school and then i went
[1:36:23] to wisconsin
[1:36:24] green bay that's where i was
[1:36:27] and
[1:36:28] i did my fellowship there at aurora bay
[1:36:30] care after my fellowship
[1:36:33] and then uh we were expecting our third
[1:36:36] child
[1:36:37] elia
[1:36:39] he was born uh
[1:36:41] like a month ago
[1:36:43] and at that time since you were just me
[1:36:46] and my wife in
[1:36:48] in pennsylvania and uh basically uh
[1:36:51] there
[1:36:52] in wisconsin and we say that
[1:36:54] since we are only here by ourselves we
[1:36:57] need to be close to a family so and then
[1:36:59] we say that we need to go close to a
[1:37:02] family
[1:37:03] and fortunately my family family-in-law
[1:37:05] is here
[1:37:06] in a minia police area so and we moved
[1:37:10] straight over here
[1:37:12] and i was fellowshipping with brother
[1:37:14] joe so i think he's a spoken word church
[1:37:18] that's why i will fellowship and i was
[1:37:20] preaching there too as well
[1:37:22] and when we were ready to come over here
[1:37:24] so i told brother joe
[1:37:27] i think he looks like we gotta go to uh
[1:37:32] minneapolis because we need to be close
[1:37:34] to the family so therefore
[1:37:37] that's when he gave me the number of
[1:37:39] brother uh one and a couple of one i say
[1:37:41] brazil one i'm gonna be there so and uh
[1:37:44] i just
[1:37:45] i just need to make sure that you know i
[1:37:47] have a place where i can worship
[1:37:50] and you know that's what brother branham
[1:37:51] said president said that a true
[1:37:53] christian
[1:37:55] whenever you try to move to any place
[1:37:57] make sure the first thing you do
[1:37:59] is to call
[1:38:02] that place and find out if there's a
[1:38:05] place where you can worship
[1:38:08] because you can live in a city but if
[1:38:10] you don't have a place where you can
[1:38:12] worship you're gonna just be like a
[1:38:15] shepherd without a guard so you're going
[1:38:18] to just be there
[1:38:19] and you're going to be looking and
[1:38:20] you're going to end up
[1:38:23] fellowship with people who you can
[1:38:25] fellowship with
[1:38:26] so and
[1:38:28] i always make sure whenever i move
[1:38:30] around and make sure that i call and
[1:38:32] make sure that i have a place where i
[1:38:34] can worship and i'm so grateful i found
[1:38:37] my family here so brothers and sisters
[1:38:40] here they are really my family and
[1:38:42] when my wife delivered the baby and then
[1:38:45] really i saw a big support from the
[1:38:47] church your prayers and i really say
[1:38:50] thank you so much and may god bless you
[1:38:52] because it was very hard for me to
[1:38:54] combine work and family so having two
[1:38:58] small children
[1:38:59] and going to work at the same time so it
[1:39:02] was not really uh
[1:39:04] easy for me so and also
[1:39:06] fortunately me and brother one we work
[1:39:08] in the same building so sometime by the
[1:39:11] time i want to cry i just go to his
[1:39:13] office and cry to his office down there
[1:39:15] so because he works in a
[1:39:19] um in a basement somewhere so and then i
[1:39:22] just go there and then just have lunch
[1:39:24] together and then trying to encourage me
[1:39:27] and uh sister there uh um
[1:39:30] cnn megan's sister
[1:39:32] yeah
[1:39:33] yeah sister eunice you know she was
[1:39:35] always come to spend time with my wife
[1:39:38] and a couple other sisters you know they
[1:39:40] came over and that was really a blessing
[1:39:42] i really want to say thank you and may
[1:39:44] god bless you for that
[1:39:46] so i can't really have anything to give
[1:39:49] you but just to pray for you and for the
[1:39:51] love and the support that you you show
[1:39:53] for my for my family is that means a lot
[1:39:57] for me so thank you so much and in
[1:39:59] houston texas i used to fellowship with
[1:40:02] uh brother zoe uh i think brother ariel
[1:40:04] know brother zoe so he's uh he's my
[1:40:07] pastor there in houston texas and uh
[1:40:10] i was still in contact and we uh and i
[1:40:13] was i was one of the preacher there too
[1:40:15] as well so it was really a good um
[1:40:19] a good time for me now to move up and to
[1:40:22] come on this side
[1:40:24] of the town
[1:40:26] and uh tonight i just want to say
[1:40:29] something which is
[1:40:31] something very common i think uh when
[1:40:35] uh the other
[1:40:37] brother was here he was talking about
[1:40:39] patience
[1:40:40] and i know
[1:40:42] patience is something that
[1:40:44] we all need in life
[1:40:47] and
[1:40:48] since today is just something that we
[1:40:50] can encourage each other on and since is
[1:40:54] the end of the year and in couple hours
[1:40:56] we're going to be in 2022
[1:40:59] so
[1:41:00] i want to just say that
[1:41:02] the patient that she was talking about
[1:41:04] here i experience it
[1:41:08] experience it
[1:41:09] because before i came here united states
[1:41:11] i was a refuge
[1:41:13] refugee
[1:41:15] i was in a camp refugee in uganda
[1:41:18] so how many of you been refugees
[1:41:22] yeah
[1:41:24] so
[1:41:25] a refugee is someone who
[1:41:29] needs
[1:41:30] who you have
[1:41:32] is a must
[1:41:33] to have patience
[1:41:37] because
[1:41:38] you don't know what you're gonna eat
[1:41:40] tomorrow you depend on someone
[1:41:43] you depend on
[1:41:45] on a u.n agency to give you something
[1:41:51] so you are hoping to eat but you don't
[1:41:54] know what you're gonna eat
[1:41:58] and for me i used to live in a camp
[1:42:01] refugee it was like in a wood-ness like
[1:42:04] desert
[1:42:05] so nobody like
[1:42:07] there's no tree
[1:42:09] and we had a lake
[1:42:10] that have you seen a green water
[1:42:14] green lake
[1:42:16] and it was smelling
[1:42:18] so they had to treat that water
[1:42:21] for that order to become
[1:42:23] white
[1:42:24] but when you go to school they teach you
[1:42:26] that water doesn't have a color
[1:42:30] but we had a water with a color
[1:42:33] green
[1:42:34] and it was smelling
[1:42:36] and functions everywhere
[1:42:42] by patience
[1:42:44] we used to have people coming in that
[1:42:46] country refugee and
[1:42:48] the same day they get there to say no
[1:42:50] i'm not i can't live here they're out
[1:42:55] and since we knew that there was a
[1:42:57] resentment in the camp refugee to come
[1:43:00] in united states
[1:43:01] now
[1:43:03] you gotta wait
[1:43:08] you see now if you put that one in
[1:43:11] spiritual form
[1:43:12] it's a same thing
[1:43:16] rapture is gonna come rapture rapture
[1:43:18] rapture there was a brother in this
[1:43:20] message i'm telling you i think he was i
[1:43:23] heard a story he was already like 54
[1:43:26] years old he believed a message since he
[1:43:28] was like 10 years old
[1:43:30] and he said you guys keep preaching
[1:43:32] about
[1:43:33] rapture rapture rapture i'm 54 today but
[1:43:36] i never see the rapture happening now
[1:43:38] i'm about to die and really he died
[1:43:42] because he didn't have a passion he
[1:43:43] didn't know when the rapture is going to
[1:43:45] come
[1:43:47] but you have to keep waiting on god
[1:43:50] amen
[1:43:53] and this message was really powerful i
[1:43:55] think that's what i was thinking about
[1:43:56] to say today i'm going to just encourage
[1:43:58] people to do you know to be patient and
[1:44:01] exactly that's what brother he was
[1:44:03] talking about
[1:44:05] and i was that camp refugee and just
[1:44:08] wait

[1:48:53] and
[1:48:54] you want to pass an exam what do you do
[1:48:57] i think i have many young people here
[1:48:59] and i just come from school you study
[1:49:02] right
[1:49:03] so you study
[1:49:05] why why are you studying
[1:49:09] because you're preparing something
[1:49:11] so you want to be ready for
[1:49:14] want to be ready for what brother
[1:49:17] for your exam
[1:49:19] so be ready
[1:49:21] as yours are going
[1:49:24] as yours are passing by
[1:49:28] and our lord
[1:49:30] is coming amen
[1:49:36] so don't be distracted
[1:49:39] and i'm gonna tell you tonight that
[1:49:43] the devil
[1:49:45] has developed many strategies
[1:49:48] to deceive
[1:49:50] the children of god
[1:49:54] he has developed many and tonight i'm
[1:49:57] going to show you how he has developed
[1:49:59] those strategies
[1:50:03] and as a children of god we should know
[1:50:07] how the devil developed those strategies
[1:50:13] because you can say i believe the
[1:50:15] message
[1:50:17] that is not enough brother
[1:50:19] that is not enough my sister
[1:50:21] i believe the message the devil believed
[1:50:23] their message yes
[1:50:26] the devil knows who brother branham is
[1:50:30] amen
[1:50:31] amen amen
[1:50:32] the devil knows jesus christ
[1:50:37] but he doesn't believe him
[1:50:40] he doesn't believe jesus christ amen
[1:50:42] amen amen
[1:50:44] so now what kind of strategies the devil
[1:50:50] has back then
[1:50:54] yours if you can go in the old testament
[1:50:58] if you sin you commit a sin
[1:51:02] god used to kill people
[1:51:04] physically amen
[1:51:07] amen
[1:51:08] he kills you straight
[1:51:12] i'm married man i go outside my marriage
[1:51:15] god keeps me straight
[1:51:17] the next day brother joseph is not the
[1:51:19] anymore
[1:51:20] and everybody will know that joseph may
[1:51:22] be young maybe he went outside his
[1:51:24] marriage that's why god and if that one
[1:51:26] would be publicly everyone would know
[1:51:29] joseph slept with somebody else that's
[1:51:30] why god killed
[1:51:32] him that's how god used to kill people
[1:51:36] back then to punish people whenever you
[1:51:39] commit a sin
[1:51:41] but today is not the same
[1:51:50] today
[1:51:51] god has changed strategy as well
[1:51:59] so deep brother
[1:52:01] today the devil has entered in a church
[1:52:05] and as the devil entered in the church
[1:52:08] he distracted the church
[1:52:11] because he knew when jesus christ went
[1:52:16] when jesus christ returned
[1:52:21] and he said that i will send my holy
[1:52:24] ghost
[1:52:27] the holy ghost came in a church now the
[1:52:30] devil
[1:52:31] his neck in a church too as well
[1:52:35] and he ended in a church
[1:52:37] and when he entered a church now
[1:52:39] everybody was distracted
[1:52:43] now you know why brother branham came
[1:52:50] because as you can see
[1:52:53] from the beginning
[1:52:56] when jesus christ left the disciples and
[1:52:59] he gave them the commission to go preach
[1:53:01] the whole world
[1:53:03] the church was strong
[1:53:07] and as they were preaching
[1:53:09] the roman empire starts killing one
[1:53:12] after one
[1:53:15] and they were killing that's why we have
[1:53:18] just because we don't have the table
[1:53:20] here
[1:53:21] the seven church edges
[1:53:24] you could see
[1:53:25] how the light was going down little by
[1:53:29] little
[1:53:32] because the devil
[1:53:33] entered in the church
[1:53:38] and
[1:53:39] scrambling the scriptures
[1:53:45] so all disciples
[1:53:47] were killed
[1:53:49] and as they were killed the light of god
[1:53:51] was going to small by small
[1:53:55] small by small
[1:53:56] now god had to restore again the word of
[1:54:00] god
[1:54:01] amen
[1:54:03] how is going to restore the word of god
[1:54:06] is by sending their prophets and that
[1:54:09] prophet does
[1:54:11] luke 17 30.
[1:54:15] because he was
[1:54:17] the requirement was the restoration of
[1:54:20] the whole gospel
[1:54:26] nothing left
[1:54:30] that's why
[1:54:32] to this day we didn't need
[1:54:35] with no need
[1:54:36] a transformer
[1:54:38] we needed a prophet
[1:54:44] someone who god will talk to and someone
[1:54:48] who will restore the whole gospel
[1:54:52] because the church was lost
[1:54:58] so now
[1:54:59] back then when god used to kill
[1:55:02] people physically
[1:55:05] just kill you physically
[1:55:07] today is not the case
[1:55:11] today
[1:55:13] those who don't believe that means they
[1:55:16] don't have the thirst of the word of god
[1:55:22] and when you don't have the thoughts
[1:55:26] of the word of god that means you are
[1:55:28] dead
[1:55:34] you must have the thirst
[1:55:36] of the word of god for you to be here
[1:55:38] tonight
[1:55:40] amen
[1:55:42] not just brother there's nothing you can
[1:55:44] do because doctors does what
[1:55:48] that's what is inside you
[1:55:50] that's the seed of god in you
[1:55:57] that thoughts that's what say amen to
[1:56:00] the word
[1:56:01] it's not you brother no
[1:56:05] because you have something from god
[1:56:08] inside you
[1:56:10] that inside that's something that's what
[1:56:13] you're saying amen
[1:56:20] i don't have time to go through coats
[1:56:22] right now you can spend the whole night
[1:56:24] here i have few minutes
[1:56:28] president brother branham said
[1:56:30] the farmer
[1:56:32] who went and took
[1:56:34] the egg off the ego
[1:56:38] he put in a chicken
[1:56:44] and
[1:56:45] the chicken had the baby
[1:56:48] the little egg the little ego
[1:56:52] now the mother was looking for my egg
[1:56:54] where's my egg he couldn't find the egg
[1:56:58] after cowboy couple days or a couple
[1:57:00] months now the baby was there
[1:57:03] now the baby because the baby chicken
[1:57:07] and the baby ego are different
[1:57:12] so therefore
[1:57:13] the food that chicken eats is not the
[1:57:16] same food as the ego eat
[1:57:24] when the chicken was gonna
[1:57:28] give some food and say what do you eat
[1:57:30] no ego eat fresh yes
[1:57:34] fresh meat
[1:57:36] fresh food
[1:57:41] ego don't eat junky food right
[1:57:44] no
[1:57:45] that's right no
[1:57:49] that's why you need a fresh gospel
[1:57:52] that's why they call us eagles yes
[1:57:59] and at that time the ego was between
[1:58:03] among the chicken
[1:58:05] but it was not comfortable
[1:58:10] the ego was saying like nah this food
[1:58:12] now it was too junky
[1:58:18] going to bathroom all the time because
[1:58:19] it was too much the stomach was
[1:58:21] crumbling something was not right
[1:58:26] because the food that he was eating was
[1:58:29] not a good food
[1:58:36] that's why brother you know uh i'm gonna
[1:58:38] tell you one thing
[1:58:39] one day in the camp refugee i was
[1:58:41] talking to one brother his name is
[1:58:43] guillaume
[1:58:44] this brother he lives in uh wisconsin
[1:58:47] appleton

[1:58:55] years old i think i'm three years old
[1:58:59] than him so
[1:59:00] he he came to my house and he said
[1:59:03] brother i don't know why i don't catch

[1:59:06] pastor preached
[1:59:08] and i told him that means that is not
[1:59:10] your house
[1:59:13] he was like
[1:59:14] what i say if you can see what he's
[1:59:16] preaching that means that is not your

[1:59:37] he never returned back again
[1:59:42] amen when you come there brother he was
[1:59:46] the first day he was like he was the end
[1:59:48] of the church

[2:04:13] you don't do something that's not right
[2:04:15] no that thought is keep telling you this
[2:04:18] is not right
[2:04:20] it keep convincing you
[2:04:22] how to leave this message
[2:04:27] now since the gospel was lost my
[2:04:30] precious brother now to this end time
[2:04:34] according to luke
[2:04:36] 17 30
[2:04:39] we receive a prophet
[2:04:41] who's gonna come exactly with the
[2:04:44] message
[2:04:46] because there's there's three
[2:04:49] i can't preach right now
[2:04:51] it's gonna take my temper someone is
[2:04:52] gonna kick me out here
[2:04:56] remember
[2:04:59] there's three
[2:05:00] appellations of psalms the son of man
[2:05:03] son of god and son of david
[2:05:07] gotta be careful here
[2:05:09] when he's coming in luke 17 30
[2:05:15] he's a prophet
[2:05:18] son of man
[2:05:20] that means a prophet
[2:05:25] amen
[2:05:27] amen
[2:05:30] son of david is when you come in a
[2:05:33] millionaire
[2:05:36] amen amen amen
[2:05:38] so that's another preaching there
[2:05:41] but we got to be ready
[2:05:45] as years are going brothers and sisters
[2:05:48] we gotta be ready
[2:05:50] and how we're gonna be ready
[2:05:53] have the thirst
[2:05:57] speak to god
[2:06:00] have patience in you
[2:06:04] tell god i'm hoping on you
[2:06:07] i'm waiting on you
[2:06:10] you got to be ready every single time
[2:06:13] because you don't know when it's going
[2:06:14] gonna be you don't know when it's gonna
[2:06:16] happen
[2:06:22] and this strategy that the devil has
[2:06:24] developed in a church he came in a
[2:06:26] church and he convinced people with the
[2:06:28] wrong scriptures
[2:06:31] he twists the
[2:06:32] scriptures
[2:06:37] the little thing that people can do in
[2:06:39] the church
[2:06:40] in the right way but the devil came and
[2:06:43] he twisted a little bit so people can
[2:06:46] feel good
[2:06:50] i don't have to preach to make you feel
[2:06:52] good
[2:06:54] because we know that we live in a sin
[2:06:56] and when we come in this house we have
[2:06:59] to feel guilty
[2:07:06] yes it's a choice to come here because
[2:07:09] we want to correct our lives every
[2:07:11] single day that's why you want to be
[2:07:12] ready i mean i mean because every day
[2:07:15] when you go out what you see is a scene
[2:07:18] everywhere brother
[2:07:23] you walk in the street you seen a sin
[2:07:30] you can ask yourself why a lot of
[2:07:31] marriage are falling apart
[2:07:33] because of sin
[2:07:40] we see sin for like i can say for five
[2:07:44] days in a week
[2:07:45] but only one day we came over here so
[2:07:48] now everything that we saw say god
[2:07:50] please i don't want to remember this god
[2:07:52] god please god amen
[2:07:59] god doesn't care about your feelings but
[2:08:02] god cares about who
[2:08:05] do what
[2:08:07] god cares about those who respect his
[2:08:09] words
[2:08:12] he doesn't care about your feelings
[2:08:17] and what the devil has done as you can
[2:08:19] see today
[2:08:21] if you turn your tv
[2:08:24] the devil has done
[2:08:25] the first miracles that's why we wrote
[2:08:27] in
[2:08:29] in second television
[2:08:36] i mean i mean
[2:08:43] the devil has done a lot of false
[2:08:44] miracles
[2:08:47] but remember
[2:08:49] jesus christ said
[2:08:50] it's not those who call me father father
[2:08:53] that's do we enter but those who
[2:08:56] keep
[2:08:57] the will of my father they will enter
[2:09:00] amen amen amen
[2:09:02] just want to encourage you tonight
[2:09:04] be ready amen
[2:09:08] keep a good faith
[2:09:10] have the patience
[2:09:12] tell god i'm hoping on you i'm waiting
[2:09:15] on you every single day
[2:09:19] because the fight that we have brother
[2:09:22] is more than second world war two
[2:09:25] is more than what covid can do to us
[2:09:28] it's more than that because your soul is
[2:09:31] worth more than 10 million word
[2:09:36] only one soul
[2:09:39] i mean amen
[2:09:42] that's why i'm here tonight
[2:09:44] to tell you that as years are going
[2:09:47] very soon we're going to be 2022.
[2:09:49] what are you asking for god for this
[2:09:52] year to come
[2:09:55] the behavior that you had
[2:09:59] god what i was doing in 2021 i want to
[2:10:01] go down a little bit
[2:10:05] i want to be someone that
[2:10:07] god you can look at and be proud of me
[2:10:16] develop a personal experience with god
[2:10:21] you gotta found that personal experience
[2:10:23] you've got if you have that brother
[2:10:26] you'll always remember where you're
[2:10:28] coming from
[2:10:30] because you have that personal
[2:10:31] experience of god
[2:10:35] is like a
[2:10:36] love letter between you and god because
[2:10:39] you have that relationship you have that
[2:10:41] experience with him every single day you
[2:10:43] keep remem remembering
[2:10:46] and that's what bring the thoughts of
[2:10:48] his word inside you
[2:10:53] that's my encouragement tonight and may
[2:10:56] god bless you
[2:11:06] god bless you brother
[2:11:10] amen
[2:11:13] lord prepare me
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:20] you went
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:51] for you
[2:11:55] oh lord
[2:11:57] prepare
[2:11:59] me
[2:12:01] to be ascend to you
[2:12:04] where
[2:12:06] [Music]
[2:12:14] tried and true
[2:12:20] [Music]
[2:12:25] i'll be
[2:12:30] [Music]
[2:12:43] the scripture says the bride
[2:12:47] make herself ready
[2:12:48] amen
[2:12:50] praise the lord
[2:12:52] the bride make herself ready
[2:12:55] and like we know from the book of esther
[2:12:58] all of those things that were
[2:13:00] needed
[2:13:02] for the bride was given to them
[2:13:04] for them to make themselves ready praise
[2:13:07] the lord
[2:13:09] and
[2:13:12] that's the reason why
[2:13:13] the wedding
[2:13:14] ceremony we create an expectation the
[2:13:17] bride is the last one that comes in
[2:13:20] and then
[2:13:22] the marriage officer go right into the
[2:13:24] wedding
[2:13:25] so
[2:13:26] i pray that the lord who
[2:13:29] we help us and
[2:13:31] we will take his word
[2:13:33] and get ourselves ready for a rapture
[2:13:36] amen

[2:14:18] from the foundation of the world and
[2:14:20] it's those healing types

[2:25:36] couldn't live with your neighbor you
[2:25:39] couldn't associate with the next man
[2:25:42] on the next corner you couldn't

[2:26:53] something what i i love the way intro is
[2:26:56] already introduced my preaching
[2:26:59] encouraging you i said we didn't come

[2:27:23] we can be happy is in the presence
[2:27:27] the place that we can just smile is the
[2:27:29] presence of god
[2:27:30] so
[2:27:31] for me i'm okay if you can say until
[2:27:33] five o'clock

[2:28:06] know why
[2:28:07] very if they say 45 minutes when i start
[2:28:10] to cross 45 minutes i start feel checked
[2:28:13] i don't know

[2:28:28] you don't steal you got as i said and
[2:28:31] you're lovely and you got the peace joy
[2:28:34] and the law suffering now
[2:28:36] the prophet is trying to show us
[2:28:40] the new spirit
[2:28:43] and his
[2:28:45] spirit
[2:28:47] breath i don't want to read the law of
[2:28:48] god sister you can just remove can we're
[2:28:50] going to judge jump there is a lot of
[2:28:51] code can you imagine in 20 minutes i
[2:28:53] have got all this paper can you imagine
[2:28:56] crazy
[2:28:58] a lot of things in my mind
[2:29:00] so
[2:29:04] in fact
[2:29:05] when you are a christian
[2:29:08] is a process
[2:29:11] christianity is a process
[2:29:14] that's why
[2:29:15] there is a patient
[2:29:17] is a process
[2:29:19] now when god is working to somebody
[2:29:22] then that person must wait upon the lord
[2:29:25] and when you're waiting upon the lord is
[2:29:26] busy renewing you know the scripture
[2:29:30] until you reach
[2:29:32] to the perfect stature of
[2:29:35] men
[2:29:36] so
[2:29:37] now i want to show you that
[2:29:41] sometimes
[2:29:43] people they get the new spirit
[2:29:46] they thought that
[2:29:47] that is the holy spirit
[2:29:51] that's where we get a problem in the now
[2:29:53] we don't preach to the pentecostal
[2:29:56] i i love the way i put that away the
[2:29:58] brother they said
[2:29:59] they they they they were sneak already
[2:30:02] we have a
[2:30:03] of preachers behind the pulpit
[2:30:06] i'm telling you if you don't see them
[2:30:08] you are not you don't they are behind
[2:30:10] that's why you must have a spirit of
[2:30:12] checking don't judge a person by the
[2:30:14] church by the tribal by tribe it came
[2:30:17] from that person by the spirit
[2:30:20] he can be the right church good pastor
[2:30:22] good spirit but even you've got the
[2:30:24] wrong spirit and be anointed with a
[2:30:27] genuine holy spirit come on now clap the
[2:30:30] hand for the lord
[2:30:33] that's the
[2:30:35] dangerous time we've got right now
[2:30:37] that's why sometimes someone was very
[2:30:39] holy 30 years in the message wholly for
[2:30:42] it after they quit i never believe
[2:30:44] anymore i just quit
[2:30:46] that holy spirit was around his spirit
[2:30:50] that holy spirit never dropped in the
[2:30:53] soul
[2:30:54] we are talking about the soul the soul
[2:30:57] must come
[2:30:58] first hallelujah it's about a love
[2:31:02] affair when you love the lord he gonna
[2:31:05] just lead you to himself but now you
[2:31:09] can't complain and ever excuse us
[2:31:11] because somebody is in the message he
[2:31:15] quit the message if all it do this
[2:31:18] that's not your business mind your own
[2:31:21] business way but when he's doing that
[2:31:23] you
[2:31:25] think when someone fall
[2:31:27] in this sin you check yourself you also
[2:31:30] you are weak with some also you are also
[2:31:33] back by tas
[2:31:35] you are also a gag rajas i don't know
[2:31:38] that's my english don't worry you have a
[2:31:40] grudge you know those things whatever so
[2:31:43] all those things is to help you
[2:31:46] to stand and not to think wrong about
[2:31:48] people all of us will have a quick slang
[2:31:52] sling we can slink so when somebody fall
[2:31:55] look at your side which side are you
[2:31:58] sweet
[2:31:59] pray for yourself this is your self
[2:32:03] matter it's not about your brother it's
[2:32:05] not your sister it's about yourself
[2:32:07] [Music]
[2:32:09] you are busy gossiping about others
[2:32:12] when you are worse than the one you are
[2:32:15] causing
[2:32:15] [Applause]
[2:32:18] praise god hallelujah praise god
[2:32:21] come on now
[2:32:22] oh my my my my clapton for the lord
[2:32:26] praise god
[2:32:35] time you know
[2:32:36] time go ahead
[2:32:40] i just want to jump
[2:32:41] i know sister she's ready there just
[2:32:43] wanna jump scriptures
[2:32:48] let the one we go after
[2:32:50] let me just read this someone somewhere
[2:32:53] there
[2:32:54] is a
[2:32:59] kadesh banner
[2:33:00] sister number seven that's my style me i
[2:33:04] don't follow oda i just put in this
[2:33:06] order but they know me very well another
[2:33:07] seven they jump they go to seven
[2:33:09] hallelujah god bless you brother and
[2:33:11] decision you are so blessed for us i
[2:33:13] don't know god's keeping long and give
[2:33:14] you a desire for your heart claim this
[2:33:16] for the lord
[2:33:22] number seven all right
[2:33:25] number seven
[2:33:26] are you okay with number seven that's my
[2:33:27] second okay
[2:33:29] oh you you always
[2:33:31] fantastic praise god
[2:33:34] and that's where a great bunch
[2:33:38] of our trouble lay today
[2:33:40] we could put our finger on it
[2:33:44] is men and the woman women
[2:33:46] who come into church and profess to be
[2:33:49] believers and they are not believers
[2:33:52] i ever found it in the pulpit i've found
[2:33:55] it in a prayer line i've found it in
[2:33:57] everywhere
[2:33:58] where men come in and the women who said
[2:34:01] i am a believer and profess to be a
[2:34:04] believer and they are not believers
[2:34:09] that's a very horrible situation in the
[2:34:11] state we are in
[2:34:13] so it is not about you say you are a
[2:34:15] believer you are already a believer
[2:34:17] is a process so what prabhupada said so
[2:34:20] is he realized that people
[2:34:22] they are they they
[2:34:24] they lack only churches
[2:34:26] they come to church they hear about the
[2:34:28] word they go back the same
[2:34:31] they are about the word they go
[2:34:33] back the same now
[2:34:35] the holy spirit
[2:34:37] the danger now we are living today
[2:34:40] is that the genuine holy spirit can
[2:34:43] anoint
[2:34:44] the devil one the genuine holy spirit
[2:34:48] can anoint the saint one genuine i'm not
[2:34:52] talking about the ghost that's right
[2:34:55] that's the danger when there is a
[2:34:57] atmosphere god come down and then they
[2:35:00] start to operate and work and all of
[2:35:02] them they jump they scream miracles
[2:35:05] whatever but
[2:35:07] by their fruit
[2:35:09] we shall know them
[2:35:12] that's life
[2:35:14] that's why
[2:35:16] when there is a life of god
[2:35:19] there is god amen because without the
[2:35:22] life wherever you do miracles whatever
[2:35:25] you can jump whatever you can preach
[2:35:28] whatever you can do but if there is no
[2:35:30] life
[2:35:31] we have a question mark like we love you
[2:35:33] you know judas also was our brother
[2:35:37] jesus never said call judas devil
[2:35:40] himself you have a right to call him one
[2:35:42] of you is a devil
[2:35:44] but he didn't tell you to call jesus
[2:35:45] devil
[2:35:46] there is a three kind of believer
[2:35:48] sitting here
[2:35:50] which side are you my brother which side
[2:35:53] are you my sister the message of the
[2:35:55] hour has come it's come down it's
[2:35:58] transforming you the people so when they
[2:36:00] touch your side you become angry to the
[2:36:03] preacher or to the what's wrong why why
[2:36:05] did you why did you come here
[2:36:09] we need some preaching to shake you it
[2:36:12] will make you to down your knees and
[2:36:14] pray
[2:36:16] we are living in the age where we must
[2:36:19] manifest the god in our life i'm sick
[2:36:22] and tired touching wednesday the sunday
[2:36:25] we are the same no ways come on now
[2:36:29] [Applause]
[2:36:31] myself i've been sick and tired
[2:36:34] something must happen
[2:36:36] something must have happened
[2:36:38] cleveland for the lord
[2:36:42] please god
[2:36:44] you know sometimes it's not good to
[2:36:45] follow news
[2:36:47] it's not good when you're following the
[2:36:48] news if it's if there is a waste and
[2:36:51] more problem
[2:36:52] is in the assembly of the message today
[2:36:55] more than a pentecostal if i start to
[2:36:57] tell you stories you will be shocked he
[2:36:59] knows we always hear so what happened
[2:37:02] the devil is sneaking
[2:37:04] he become a preacher
[2:37:06] judas also and he went to preach he
[2:37:09] chased also demons judas was sanctified
[2:37:11] judas was
[2:37:13] was justified sanctified was a virgin
[2:37:16] they among among peers and others they
[2:37:19] came rejoicing he said hey guys don't
[2:37:21] rejoice
[2:37:23] why because the gen that's a dangerous
[2:37:26] part the genuine holy spirit can anoint
[2:37:29] the dev i've got quotations i don't want
[2:37:31] to read it i don't have time if you need
[2:37:33] quotation i want to give
[2:37:35] if you want but it's not about
[2:37:37] quotations it's about you the quotation
[2:37:39] must be a man walking hallelujah the
[2:37:41] quotation must be a sister walking
[2:37:44] the devil is late because the message
[2:37:47] now it's working on the streets
[2:37:48] hallelujah that's their praise god grab
[2:37:51] them for the lord amen
[2:37:53] [Applause]
[2:37:58] glory be to god amen
[2:38:07] leadership
[2:38:09] sister uh god
[2:38:12] 11.
[2:38:16] so we are organizing with them 11 wow oh
[2:38:19] praise the lord so he said
[2:38:23] they that cannot stand just men
[2:38:26] are bastards the children and not the
[2:38:28] children of god see
[2:38:30] they are worked
[2:38:31] up on the emotion
[2:38:33] see they see that i walked about a while
[2:38:36] ago that soul wasn't there
[2:38:38] to start with it was anointed with the
[2:38:41] spirit
[2:38:42] and it done all kinds
[2:38:45] all you did when your spirit's anointed
[2:38:49] you can it's the real
[2:38:51] genuine holy spirit
[2:38:53] and you could still be
[2:38:57] yes sir that one i have to read it i
[2:38:59] didn't want to jump
[2:39:01] so the time we are living it's a
[2:39:04] horrible time now the dangerous part is
[2:39:08] the children of god
[2:39:10] we always said god always
[2:39:13] a god always
[2:39:15] make uh full christians yeah i believe
[2:39:18] that god never make a half christian i
[2:39:21] believe that oh everything is good is it
[2:39:23] fine but there is
[2:39:25] i always like those
[2:39:26] shocking code
[2:39:28] those people they don't read too much i
[2:39:30] always give it to myself
[2:39:32] let us receive
[2:39:34] five
[2:39:36] i like code because there there is no
[2:39:38] discussion i said this this preachers
[2:39:41] there was too much on us they saw that
[2:39:44] we will because as we are sitting and
[2:39:46] they own us do you believe the message
[2:39:49] of our sister if you believe the measure
[2:39:51] of the how we believe brother branham
[2:39:53] your prophet and the god to speak this
[2:39:55] time through his prophet malachi
[2:39:57] william marion
[2:40:00] and everything he said we don't discuss
[2:40:02] we believe
[2:40:03] that's why our culture is the message of
[2:40:06] the hour your culture forget your tribe
[2:40:08] for gate the message of yahweh is our
[2:40:11] culture home praise god
[2:40:14] [Applause]
[2:40:23] don't mind me just like you
[2:40:26] if you are a christian that's where i am
[2:40:28] yes total deliverance just like you
[2:40:30] if i a christian god doesn't make any
[2:40:33] halfway creation god make completely
[2:40:35] christians
[2:40:37] it doesn't talk about the devil this is
[2:40:38] easy children that's where i'm going
[2:40:42] go that don't make us
[2:40:44] we're preacher but the preacher can be
[2:40:47] halfway
[2:40:50] and the god makes his children
[2:40:52] christians but sometimes they are
[2:40:54] halfway creation
[2:40:56] do you believe the prophet left the hand
[2:40:59] for the lord
[2:41:05] but it's not good intention for them to
[2:41:08] be that way it's their own way got mixed
[2:41:11] up with the plan of god for their life
[2:41:14] and that's what makes them the the way
[2:41:16] they are god don't want them to be the
[2:41:19] halfway christians of halfway preachers
[2:41:22] by compromising
[2:41:23] on that and side on was them completely
[2:41:26] stand it preach
[2:41:28] amen amen sometimes ourselves
[2:41:32] we can be up way
[2:41:34] that's why sometimes
[2:41:36] sometimes the
[2:41:38] the
[2:41:40] will sometimes we lack we be chosen
[2:41:42] before the of the world or the children
[2:41:44] of god sometimes you can delay
[2:41:48] yeah sometimes you can delay your growth
[2:41:51] and we are going to the rapture rapture
[2:41:53] is ready
[2:41:54] and there is a process so we have to
[2:41:57] look for the last one to enter but
[2:41:59] sometimes you can see the last one is
[2:42:01] and the pentacles is outside maybe the
[2:42:03] last one is sitting on the bench
[2:42:04] delaying is to afterward creation
[2:42:07] [Music]
[2:42:09] that's why i like this coat i just bring
[2:42:10] it sometimes we have to balance yes we
[2:42:12] have chosen but we are living in it
[2:42:14] through anthony through moral urgency so
[2:42:18] you have to choose sometimes you are so
[2:42:19] lazy with your work sometimes you you
[2:42:22] don't wanna to hear
[2:42:24] your mistake when they preach about
[2:42:26] repentance you become angry why you
[2:42:29] don't want people to preach about
[2:42:31] repentance why are you hiding you don't

[2:50:18] the prophet of god make us to know
[2:50:23] repentance was in the bribe portion

[2:55:31] are doing a great job this evening
[2:55:33] thank you so much let's give them a
[2:55:36] handcuff here
[2:55:42] you know it's always good to remember
[2:55:44] all the support
[2:55:46] pieces that come in that you wouldn't
[2:55:49] you don't realize how much
[2:55:51] they actually mean to the body until
[2:55:53] they're gone
[2:55:54] but how much they actually add these are
[2:55:56] people who have they're actually a part
[2:55:58] of the ministry
[2:56:00] and they come and they prepare their
[2:56:01] hearts and they set their time aside
[2:56:04] even before they get into service and
[2:56:06] they have already put so much into the
[2:56:08] service before they ever get here so
[2:56:09] that they can minister all to all of us
[2:56:11] and i i just want to appreciate that
[2:56:14] um
[2:56:15] real quick we're gonna jump right in i
[2:56:17] know brother one gave me his time but
[2:56:18] i'll try not to take all of it
[2:56:20] um
[2:56:21] i was figuring i was down to about five
[2:56:23] minutes
[2:56:24] and so
[2:56:26] uh just real quickly we'll go to
[2:56:28] revelations chapter eight and verse one
[2:56:31] i've just got one
[2:56:33] verse here
[2:56:35] and we'll jump in and you know
[2:56:37] my dad if there were those you don't
[2:56:38] know my dad is a minister as well and
[2:56:40] he'll always tell me he said well i'm
[2:56:42] ready i got my bombs ready we're just
[2:56:44] going to go in and drop them
[2:56:45] and so
[2:56:47] when he drops them it's about three
[2:56:48] hours worth of
[2:56:50] tonight we're just going to kind of do
[2:56:52] the old world war ii or dive bomb right
[2:56:54] in let it go and jump right out
[2:56:57] all right say amen if you got the
[2:56:59] scripture there
[2:57:01] all right let's read it together here
[2:57:04] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[2:57:07] there was silence in heaven
[2:57:09] about the space of a half hour
[2:57:12] let's pray
[2:57:13] heavenly father lord we just come before
[2:57:15] you once again this evening just so
[2:57:16] thankful to be here in your presence
[2:57:19] father lord in the midst of your people
[2:57:21] father lord we can be so positive that
[2:57:24] your presence is here because i look out
[2:57:25] and i see your people gathered father
[2:57:28] and you said wherever two or three
[2:57:30] are gathered in my name there i'll be
[2:57:32] also father and so lord all i can assume
[2:57:35] is that as i look out and see all your
[2:57:37] people here father that there's an
[2:57:39] innumerable host gathered with us but
[2:57:41] not just an innumerable host of angels
[2:57:43] but you yourself are standing here
[2:57:45] beside us father lord it's not just a
[2:57:48] thing of the time of the prophets of old
[2:57:51] or the time of the prophet of our age
[2:57:53] father but lord we believe you still
[2:57:56] come on the scene and stand here right
[2:57:58] at the pulpit father and it's not the
[2:58:00] the man standing behind the pulpit for
[2:58:02] father if that's true then we might as
[2:58:04] well just all leave but it's you
[2:58:06] anointing the man to speak father in
[2:58:09] your truth pouring forth to the heart of
[2:58:11] the believer and also you there and the
[2:58:14] soul in the heart of believer anointing
[2:58:16] that word to the heart to meet that need
[2:58:18] father and stir up faith we just thank
[2:58:21] you for that we give you all honor glory
[2:58:23] and praise in jesus name amen you may be
[2:58:26] seated
[2:58:27] you know i've actually had this on my
[2:58:29] heart and on my mind for quite some time
[2:58:32] i'm watching my time and i'm down to two
[2:58:34] minutes i think
[2:58:36] but brother one had actually asked me to
[2:58:38] minister quite some time ago and i'm one
[2:58:40] of those
[2:58:41] ministers and i think i actually that's
[2:58:43] probably most ministers is you sit in a
[2:58:45] congregation and you listen to other
[2:58:46] ministers preach and you write down
[2:58:48] notes and most people i don't know but i
[2:58:51] would assume right down notes are
[2:58:52] actually more or less direct quotations
[2:58:55] and i think a lot of times ministers
[2:58:56] when they write down notes they're
[2:58:58] writing down what it was that it made
[2:59:00] them think of
[2:59:01] and so if you went back and read their
[2:59:03] notes from that
[2:59:04] service you would have no clue what the
[2:59:05] service was about
[2:59:08] but
[2:59:09] you know that's kind of how i do and
[2:59:10] then
[2:59:11] whenever
[2:59:12] you know the lord puts it on the heart
[2:59:13] of a minister or brother one or whoever
[2:59:15] i'm at to ask me to speak i pull from
[2:59:18] those things
[2:59:19] and there'll just be things that the
[2:59:20] lord will be working on my heart and
[2:59:22] this whole half hour of silence and the
[2:59:25] setting around the seventh seal and i
[2:59:27] know there's a lot of debate in and
[2:59:29] amongst the message on the seal is open
[2:59:31] is it closed and we're not going to jump
[2:59:32] into that and but there's a lot of
[2:59:34] things that trouble me about it and
[2:59:36] about the half hour of silence and you
[2:59:39] know people talking we don't know what's
[2:59:40] going on there and and whatnot
[2:59:43] but i would like to take a little title
[2:59:45] and i wasn't sure which one to title it
[2:59:47] but i have the seventh seal mystery of
[2:59:49] your life
[2:59:51] or the believer's half hour of silence
[2:59:53] with the lord
[2:59:55] now
[2:59:56] as you
[2:59:57] if you've been in the message a while or
[2:59:59] you've studied and you've got into it
[3:00:01] you realize brother adam talks about the
[3:00:03] seals he says if you would go back to
[3:00:05] genesis you can find the seals in the
[3:00:08] book of genesis right and so if you jump
[3:00:10] back to the book of genesis and i'm
[3:00:12] going to go real fast here so just stay
[3:00:13] with me you'll find out the the parallel
[3:00:16] that you find is the days of creation
[3:00:19] where you have day one day two day three
[3:00:22] day four day five day six and then day
[3:00:25] seven right
[3:00:26] and two things that you'll find running
[3:00:28] in that parallel along with both the
[3:00:31] seals
[3:00:32] and those those six days
[3:00:34] and whatnot is you'll find out that in
[3:00:37] those first six days there's a whole lot
[3:00:40] of detail that god puts in there he
[3:00:42] tells you what he's doing and how he's
[3:00:44] doing it and where he's going and what
[3:00:46] he's doing and what the results of that
[3:00:48] is
[3:00:49] but you know everything about those six
[3:00:51] days has to do with what he's doing with
[3:00:53] this earth and the earthly things and
[3:00:56] how that's being affected by him moving
[3:00:58] up upon the water upon the land upon the
[3:01:01] plant life upon all of these things
[3:01:04] and if you go through the seals and you
[3:01:06] read about the seals
[3:01:08] or you read through the scripture of the
[3:01:10] seals or even brother random bringing
[3:01:11] the seals force he says most of the
[3:01:13] seals
[3:01:14] he said it's all history
[3:01:16] you see
[3:01:18] it's all things gone by
[3:01:20] and the the seal that we have left is
[3:01:22] gonna be tell us what's gonna what's to
[3:01:24] come
[3:01:25] we know like the sixth seal it's
[3:01:26] unfolding now
[3:01:28] we're in the midst of it the fifth seal
[3:01:30] it's unfolding now
[3:01:32] there's things coming to pass now
[3:01:35] but they all have to do with
[3:01:37] tribulation with judgment on this world
[3:01:41] things that god has laid out and said
[3:01:43] these are the things to be watching for
[3:01:46] he even pointed out his timepiece israel
[3:01:50] you see because all these seals
[3:01:52] and even within the church ages he laid
[3:01:55] out things
[3:01:57] that he wasn't worried about the devil
[3:01:59] knowing
[3:02:01] but he wanted to give his people
[3:02:04] things to be watching for to know where
[3:02:06] they were at in the timeline
[3:02:08] you see but when he got to the seventh
[3:02:10] seal
[3:02:13] silence in heaven
[3:02:15] no one knew what was going on
[3:02:17] no one knew nothing brother adam says
[3:02:19] when jesus preached the the the church
[3:02:21] ages or the seals there back in the book
[3:02:23] believe the book of matthew
[3:02:25] he says he goes all the way through to
[3:02:27] six and then when he gets to what should
[3:02:29] be the seventh he breaks into parables
[3:02:35] no details
[3:02:37] and the reason why is the same reason
[3:02:40] why on the seventh day it just said and
[3:02:42] god rested
[3:02:45] is because that seventh day
[3:02:48] was about
[3:02:49] god and adam walking together towards
[3:02:52] adoption
[3:02:53] towards that perfection that he was to
[3:02:55] come to
[3:02:56] and so is the seventh seal
[3:02:59] has nothing to do with this world
[3:03:01] has nothing to do with the goings-on
[3:03:02] right now has nothing to do with
[3:03:04] coronavirus and has nothing to do with
[3:03:06] world wars has nothing to do with
[3:03:08] conflicts it has to do with one thing
[3:03:10] god and his bride
[3:03:13] okay
[3:03:14] so now we we have a concept and we can
[3:03:16] see how god's working and what he's
[3:03:19] doing right
[3:03:20] now we can apply that to our own lives
[3:03:24] all through scripture we have examples
[3:03:27] what you should do what you shouldn't do
[3:03:30] we have examples of the the
[3:03:33] of
[3:03:34] what you sow you will reap
[3:03:36] and these are all true things
[3:03:40] for everyone what about the believer
[3:03:44] no one in this room
[3:03:46] if you look back your life
[3:03:48] is reaping
[3:03:50] for the things some of the things you
[3:03:51] have sowed
[3:03:54] because
[3:03:55] you never did it in the first place
[3:03:59] so how can he attribute
[3:04:01] a growth or a crop
[3:04:05] to the sowing of a seed that never
[3:04:07] happened amen
[3:04:08] and so all of that get transitioned back
[3:04:11] on the one responsible for it the devil
[3:04:14] you see but one thing i want us to focus
[3:04:17] in on in this half hour of silence
[3:04:20] you know everyone would like to take and
[3:04:22] and go through the scripture
[3:04:24] and point out the do's and the don'ts
[3:04:27] the commandments there's the the
[3:04:29] beatitudes there's all these things
[3:04:31] right and then start looking at each
[3:04:34] especially everyone else's life we don't
[3:04:36] want to apply it to our own that gets
[3:04:37] too frightening
[3:04:39] um but we want to look and especially
[3:04:41] when about the time we get to church
[3:04:43] we've been here a few
[3:04:44] days a few years you know we're feeling
[3:04:46] pretty good and then we see someone else
[3:04:48] come in and we go uh-huh
[3:04:52] i know everything there is to know about
[3:04:54] you
[3:04:57] and what you sow you'll reap so just
[3:04:59] watch it it's coming
[3:05:01] it's coming
[3:05:02] and we like jonah
[3:05:04] we're like jonah we've gone to nineveh
[3:05:07] we've seen the sin of the city
[3:05:10] and now we're just waiting for judgment
[3:05:11] to strike
[3:05:13] and then we do the same thing too we get
[3:05:16] upset with god lord
[3:05:19] what about this one here
[3:05:21] i know what they did
[3:05:23] where's the judgment
[3:05:25] where's the judgment
[3:05:27] and then god will do like he did with
[3:05:28] jonah and he'll let some little thing
[3:05:31] that you thought was the greatest
[3:05:32] blessing in your life get taken out from
[3:05:34] you
[3:05:35] so you so he can he can show you it's
[3:05:37] not about you
[3:05:39] it's always been about me
[3:05:41] always that was the case with jonah and
[3:05:44] nineveh god told him it's not about
[3:05:45] those people
[3:05:46] it's not about you
[3:05:48] but me
[3:05:49] it's about me i created all those people
[3:05:53] and i
[3:05:55] would not have them destroyed
[3:05:58] that's by my choice how dare you cast
[3:06:01] judgment you're the one who ran
[3:06:03] in the opposite direction i knew you
[3:06:05] would run so i picked you
[3:06:07] for my purpose
[3:06:09] and it's always been for my purpose
[3:06:11] but you know
[3:06:13] we we the believer's life is
[3:06:15] encapsulated in that half hour of
[3:06:17] silence each one of us
[3:06:18] from birth
[3:06:20] and the half hour of silence
[3:06:22] encapsulates our life
[3:06:24] away from the devil
[3:06:27] you see the devil is doing the exact
[3:06:29] same thing because like the ministers
[3:06:31] have already mentioned tonight
[3:06:34] he knows this bible he knows the message
[3:06:37] he knows who jesus is he knows who the
[3:06:39] prophet
[3:06:40] is and he knows it backwards and
[3:06:43] forwards that's why he comes to you
[3:06:45] he says
[3:06:46] i know what you did
[3:06:48] and i know the scripture
[3:06:51] and per the scripture
[3:06:53] there's no way
[3:06:54] you are a son or daughter of god you
[3:06:56] might as well give up now
[3:06:58] enjoy what you can
[3:07:00] i have it to give you
[3:07:02] you see
[3:07:04] because he's doing the same thing
[3:07:06] that he's done through the saints
[3:07:07] through all the ages
[3:07:09] when he saw abraham he didn't see a
[3:07:10] great man of faith
[3:07:12] he saw a man that was tempted away
[3:07:15] and and was ready to give up
[3:07:18] his his very own wife
[3:07:20] and walk away
[3:07:21] when he when he saw jacob he didn't see
[3:07:25] a great man of faith he didn't see
[3:07:27] someone who was a prince with god
[3:07:30] when he saw david he didn't see him as
[3:07:32] as a man after god's own heart
[3:07:35] he saw david's failings and he said
[3:07:38] david should be stoned
[3:07:40] per god's own law
[3:07:42] he should be stoned
[3:07:45] you know and
[3:07:47] when he saw moses
[3:07:50] you know moses was was an
[3:07:52] active enslaver of his own people until
[3:07:54] he caught a revelation of what was going
[3:07:56] on
[3:07:58] he saw paul
[3:08:00] and he saw paul and he tried to chase
[3:08:03] paul down forever with something that
[3:08:05] god actually used to keep paul humble
[3:08:09] it was all a part of god's purpose
[3:08:12] and you know it's even like where am i
[3:08:14] at i think i'm really burning time now
[3:08:19] is that
[3:08:23] through it all
[3:08:25] and and one other thing i wrote down
[3:08:26] here is we're we are god's agents and
[3:08:28] what i mean by that
[3:08:29] is you know there's
[3:08:32] spy agencies and and special forces
[3:08:35] groups across the world for all
[3:08:36] different countries
[3:08:38] and
[3:08:39] it's easy there's plenty of videos out
[3:08:41] there and and even movies made about
[3:08:43] them and and you can find training
[3:08:46] manuals on how they do certain things
[3:08:49] but the details about their mission
[3:08:53] are super secret
[3:08:55] they're classified
[3:08:57] in fact those missions are usually never
[3:09:00] declassified until those people even
[3:09:03] have passed away and gone off the scene
[3:09:05] and even then sometimes some things that
[3:09:07] they have done never come to light
[3:09:10] and so it is with god's people
[3:09:13] by the time the devil knows who they are
[3:09:16] their mission is done and they've left
[3:09:18] the scene
[3:09:19] you know
[3:09:21] the prophet said
[3:09:23] if the devil knew what taking christ to
[3:09:25] calvary would do
[3:09:28] he would have never let him go
[3:09:30] but by the time it had happened it was
[3:09:32] too late
[3:09:33] and so it is with each one of us
[3:09:36] we we have our failings in the flesh but
[3:09:38] it has nothing to do with the seed deep
[3:09:40] inside or with god's mission for you is
[3:09:44] in this life to the rest of us maybe
[3:09:46] even to those who are close to you
[3:09:48] they're looking they're going oh my
[3:09:49] goodness wow
[3:09:52] you're you're so out of god's will
[3:09:55] it's about time you come home to the
[3:09:56] flock
[3:09:58] and and it's true
[3:10:00] there is a time that god will bring you
[3:10:03] around
[3:10:04] but there's never been a time when
[3:10:05] you've been out
[3:10:08] of god's
[3:10:10] will for your life but what he knew
[3:10:13] what you were going to do the choice you
[3:10:15] were going to make and he put you in
[3:10:16] that position for a purpose
[3:10:19] now me and you and the devil may not
[3:10:22] know what that purpose is until we've
[3:10:24] crossed into the other side
[3:10:26] in fact me and you will know the devil
[3:10:28] may never know he may be mystified until
[3:10:31] the day he's going to judgment
[3:10:34] and still not know
[3:10:36] because guess what
[3:10:37] when we go to judgment
[3:10:39] the bride isn't the one being judged
[3:10:41] she's the one handing out judgments
[3:10:44] and so our our you know brother ram
[3:10:46] talks about the great white throne
[3:10:47] judgment he said on that day as judgment
[3:10:50] is being played out the lies of those
[3:10:52] who are coming for the white great
[3:10:53] throne that their life will be played
[3:10:56] before a giant audience
[3:10:57] and everyone will see and everyone will
[3:10:59] know
[3:11:01] but not you and me
[3:11:03] the devil will be mystified until the
[3:11:06] until the last second as he's being
[3:11:08] dropped into that lake of fire to be
[3:11:10] consumed
[3:11:12] because it's classified
[3:11:14] so don't get down
[3:11:16] don't you worry
[3:11:18] god is in control
[3:11:20] let me just read you
[3:11:21] one thing here
[3:11:24] and just tie it together just
[3:11:25] let take it home think about these
[3:11:28] things take it back to the scripture
[3:11:30] think about it god
[3:11:32] to every single scripture to everything
[3:11:35] he says there's there's not just one
[3:11:38] purpose there's not just one meaning but
[3:11:40] god that's why brother branham said you
[3:11:42] can take one verse from the scripture
[3:11:45] he said you could stay on it for the
[3:11:46] rest of your life
[3:11:48] he said as god was to reveal it and open
[3:11:50] it it says it's without end
[3:11:53] you know we we think we can read one
[3:11:54] scripture we read a quote and we someone
[3:11:57] preaches on it and we think oh that's
[3:11:59] all there is to it and then we hunker
[3:12:00] down on that thing don't do that
[3:12:03] take the approach brother branham said
[3:12:05] he said he said this is what we know for
[3:12:08] right now and i'm rejoicing in it now
[3:12:10] but i'm just waiting for that next thing
[3:12:12] he's going to reveal to me that's what
[3:12:14] god wants to do with your life too
[3:12:16] so think about it when you read the
[3:12:18] seals and i know the the people have
[3:12:20] made it quite mysterious and and hard to
[3:12:23] understand and stuff don't don't worry
[3:12:25] about that stuff
[3:12:28] it's there for a purpose i'm not saying
[3:12:30] the mysteries are
[3:12:31] nothing the mysteries are something
[3:12:33] but it's not meant to be mysterious it's
[3:12:36] meant to be revealed to you personally
[3:12:38] a personal revelation between you and
[3:12:41] god that's where it is in that secret
[3:12:43] hidden place in that that moment of
[3:12:45] silence it's not a silence to you it's a
[3:12:48] silence to everyone else as god reveals
[3:12:50] himself to you
[3:12:53] so get into that secret place that's
[3:12:55] what billy brown said that third pool
[3:12:56] was all about he said that little tent
[3:12:58] vision was he said i was on the outside
[3:13:01] and the people would go in
[3:13:04] with the and the angel lord was in the
[3:13:06] tent with them that angel lord that you
[3:13:08] should stand by him it was in the tent
[3:13:10] they would enter in have a personal
[3:13:12] experience and they would come out and
[3:13:13] they would ask him what happened they
[3:13:14] would say i don't know you just have to
[3:13:16] be there
[3:13:17] and that's how it is for each and every
[3:13:18] one of our lives you enter into that
[3:13:20] place that quiet place with him that
[3:13:23] closet place
[3:13:24] every single day of every single moment
[3:13:26] of your life as he's revealing himself
[3:13:29] to you it's not silent to you it's a
[3:13:31] reality
[3:13:34] it's a silent to the devil and everyone
[3:13:36] else who's watching and it's meant to be
[3:13:38] that way because it's not their
[3:13:40] revelation it's yours personally
[3:13:43] and so
[3:13:44] don't let things be mysterious but read
[3:13:47] them if you don't understand it lord
[3:13:48] reveal this to me how does it apply to
[3:13:49] my life
[3:13:51] don't just take it as a moment in time
[3:13:52] or
[3:13:53] a nice story or
[3:13:55] oh wow that's super mysterious no no no
[3:13:58] if it's there it's there's something
[3:14:00] there for you
[3:14:01] and in the seventh seal i'm going really
[3:14:03] fast it was in paragraph 394
[3:14:05] and
[3:14:06] just a portion of it it says
[3:14:08] no
[3:14:10] we find that christ the lamb took the
[3:14:12] book in his hand and he opened that
[3:14:14] seventh seal but you see it's a hidden
[3:14:16] mystery no one knows it
[3:14:18] but it's right along with what he said
[3:14:21] no one would know his coming they also
[3:14:24] would not know about the seven thunder
[3:14:26] mystery so you see it's connected
[3:14:29] together
[3:14:31] you see
[3:14:33] you personally but random said
[3:14:35] when you receive the holy ghost
[3:14:39] no one else knows
[3:14:41] you yourself you marked that spot
[3:14:44] now as life goes on people will know if
[3:14:46] you received it
[3:14:47] but no one can no one but you can mark
[3:14:50] the point
[3:14:51] and drive an anchor down and say this is
[3:14:53] where this is where it happened
[3:14:56] and that's where it is he's coming to
[3:14:58] meet you there
[3:15:00] he's coming to meet you there and no one
[3:15:02] knows about it no one knew that's why he
[3:15:04] said it would be like a a thief in the
[3:15:06] night
[3:15:09] you just have to be ready
[3:15:11] he's not going to give you
[3:15:12] a certain date so that you can you know
[3:15:15] a lot of us like to procrastinate you're
[3:15:16] talking brother you were talking about
[3:15:18] studying
[3:15:19] and i i know all about it and and my
[3:15:22] thing is is especially when i'm really
[3:15:24] dreading something we procrastinate
[3:15:26] which we set it to the side we're like
[3:15:28] ah okay i got
[3:15:30] two more days
[3:15:31] okay
[3:15:32] i think
[3:15:33] i can i can do this little thing over
[3:15:35] here and this little thing over here and
[3:15:38] and i still got enough time i'll be okay
[3:15:40] and come down down to the last minute
[3:15:42] you're like oh no
[3:15:44] i have this test and i haven't studied
[3:15:46] it's not that you didn't have the time
[3:15:48] it's just there's something about human
[3:15:50] natures we anything that we're
[3:15:52] uncomfortable with or we're we're kind
[3:15:54] of
[3:15:55] nervous about we we tend to put off and
[3:15:57] put off and put off because we don't
[3:15:58] have to face it but god doesn't give you
[3:16:00] a specific time and date he just says be
[3:16:02] ready
[3:16:03] be ready because i'm coming
[3:16:05] i'm not you're not going to know when
[3:16:08] and no one else is going to know when
[3:16:09] but when i come knocking be ready to
[3:16:11] open the door don't be sleeping
[3:16:14] don't be sleeping i'm coming
[3:16:17] so saints
[3:16:18] we're in that half hour of silence
[3:16:21] not just as a bride but personally and
[3:16:24] it's an exciting time because it's the
[3:16:26] bride
[3:16:27] and groom
[3:16:29] getting to know each other like never
[3:16:31] before because saints we're not going to
[3:16:34] the marriage of the lamb
[3:16:36] we're going to the marriage supper of
[3:16:38] the lamb and we're in the marriage time
[3:16:40] now
[3:16:41] so if you're not entering into that time
[3:16:44] of the marriage with the lamb then
[3:16:46] you're missing out
[3:16:48] enter into that little tent that little
[3:16:50] closet and let that be just slip away
[3:16:54] just you and him god bless you saints
[3:16:58] [Applause]
[3:17:09] amen i praise the lord
[3:17:15] [Music]
[3:17:38] worship
[3:17:52] his name
[3:18:04] listing closely
[3:18:08] yay
[3:18:09] [Music]
[3:18:34] never be
[3:18:47] [Music]
[3:19:02] is
[3:19:04] [Music]
[3:19:22] is
[3:19:25] [Music]
[3:19:58] bobby
[3:20:00] [Music]
[3:20:08] i was listening to
[3:20:11] a very prominent teacher he's a very
[3:20:14] good bible teacher he's a scholar
[3:20:16] he knows the ju
[3:20:18] the hebrew
[3:20:21] and i was listening to him teaching
[3:20:23] on the sequence of time and he was
[3:20:25] talking about
[3:20:26] at the white throne judgment and after
[3:20:29] the judgment
[3:20:30] and we would get our reward and he said
[3:20:33] he said
[3:20:34] and and i believe it's right in that
[3:20:36] time the bride will be called
[3:20:40] i said oh
[3:20:41] my goodness
[3:20:46] i said oh my goodness because he was
[3:20:48] actually teaching
[3:20:50] and what he was trying to place in
[3:20:52] scripture
[3:20:53] was the willing supper so in his
[3:20:57] understanding the bride will be caught
[3:20:59] right after the sheep and the goat
[3:21:01] judgment and then there will be a
[3:21:03] wedding supper but you see the thing
[3:21:06] about it there is that
[3:21:08] there cannot be a wedding
[3:21:11] without
[3:21:13] the bridegroom
[3:21:17] there cannot be a wedding without the
[3:21:19] bride
[3:21:21] now if you have the bride and the
[3:21:24] bridegroom
[3:21:25] still there cannot be a wedding
[3:21:28] if you don't have the wedding officer
[3:21:31] there is someone that's supposed to
[3:21:33] perform the wedding
[3:21:36] and waiting without a wedding officer
[3:21:40] is when people live as common law
[3:21:43] husband and wife
[3:21:44] a man and a woman that joined themselves
[3:21:47] together
[3:21:48] without the pronouncing
[3:21:50] from
[3:21:51] the wedding officer you are just common
[3:21:54] lord husband and wife there must be
[3:21:56] somebody
[3:21:58] that that that has been licensed by the
[3:22:01] state
[3:22:02] or licensed
[3:22:04] you know commissioned by the word to
[3:22:06] perform the marriage
[3:22:08] so if there is a marriage of the lamb
[3:22:11] there have to be a wedding officer
[3:22:15] that perform the marriage of the lamb
[3:22:18] praise the lord and until you are in the
[3:22:21] marriage of the lamb
[3:22:22] you cannot be in a wedding supper
[3:22:25] it's a kind of a different difference we
[3:22:28] find time and you know we just don't
[3:22:30] have time to talk about it but we want
[3:22:32] to just appreciate the lord tonight
[3:22:34] speaking about us you know running the
[3:22:36] race with patient
[3:22:37] and uh uh brother jordan manny come and
[3:22:40] talking about
[3:22:42] uh preparation getting yourself ready
[3:22:45] and then
[3:22:46] brother uh brother joe
[3:22:50] mushuta comes and tells teach about
[3:22:54] what makes it difficult to leave
[3:22:56] christian live in and
[3:22:59] you know bringing us to the place of
[3:23:00] repentance preparing ourselves
[3:23:03] and then brother jordan comes with a
[3:23:04] half hour of silence praise the lord
[3:23:07] we just we want to be thankful
[3:23:10] we want to be thankful all i can say to
[3:23:12] you tonight that he that have an ear
[3:23:15] we hear what the spirit said
[3:23:17] praise the lord
[3:23:18] is now what the brother said
[3:23:21] is what the spirit said that's what you
[3:23:23] must be listening for praise the lord
[3:23:26] amen and i hope that the spirit says
[3:23:29] something to you tonight
[3:23:31] that was encouraging
[3:23:33] amen
[3:23:36] praise the lord
[3:23:41] the lord bless you you may just have
[3:23:42] your seat
[3:23:44] i want to read a vision to you
[3:23:47] just before
[3:23:48] we go into praying
[3:23:51] [Music]
[3:24:00] it's from the message paradox
[3:24:07] i want to share this vision with you
[3:24:15] and we will read that
[3:24:17] and just
[3:24:19] take ourselves into pray
[3:24:21] as we welcome the coming year
[3:24:26] i have mentioned it once and i was going
[3:24:28] out
[3:24:29] and i was going to cut it off the tape
[3:24:31] but i believe
[3:24:33] i would just leave it
[3:24:35] it was about three or three o'clock in
[3:24:37] the morning i suppose
[3:24:40] they got him up and i look were in front
[3:24:43] of me
[3:24:45] and i was coming down to jordan
[3:24:48] looked like i was standing on the map of
[3:24:51] palestine and i
[3:24:53] and i was coming down to the jordan and
[3:24:55] it seems like i could hear a song i'm
[3:24:58] going down to the jordan someone was
[3:25:01] singing it
[3:25:02] and as i drew near the river i look back
[3:25:06] and it and seems which away
[3:25:10] i had come and
[3:25:12] i was too tired of the way there to
[3:25:15] jordan
[3:25:16] and i look across jordan
[3:25:19] and i said oh praise god just
[3:25:23] on the other side is where all the
[3:25:26] promises lay
[3:25:28] on the other side
[3:25:31] praise the lord
[3:25:32] is where all
[3:25:34] the promises laid every promise laying
[3:25:38] in
[3:25:39] the promised land
[3:25:41] and we know that the promised land
[3:25:44] for the believers
[3:25:45] is uh is is the is the promise is the is
[3:25:48] the holy ghost amen
[3:25:50] praise the lord the holy ghost is the
[3:25:53] promise this promise is unto you
[3:25:56] and and to your children and to many as
[3:25:58] the lord our god shall call is a promise
[3:26:02] but when that promise possess your body
[3:26:04] then it becomes the promised land
[3:26:07] amen because that promise must be
[3:26:09] fulfilled somewhere
[3:26:13] israel was given a natural land we are
[3:26:15] giving a spiritual land to be able to
[3:26:18] enjoy the promises of god in this body
[3:26:22] praise the lord
[3:26:24] so right across there lays the promised
[3:26:27] land and then
[3:26:29] i came to myself and i thought kuwaiti
[3:26:32] who are possibly
[3:26:34] who it have been
[3:26:36] i was dreaming
[3:26:38] or was it uh
[3:26:39] of course it was nighttime see a vision
[3:26:42] is something that you you see with your
[3:26:45] eyes open
[3:26:47] just like a drain but this time your
[3:26:49] eyes are stopping and then as
[3:26:52] and then as i said there a little bit
[3:26:55] beside the chair
[3:26:58] and all for all of a sudden yeah come
[3:27:01] here it comes back again
[3:27:04] then i knew then
[3:27:06] that it was a vision
[3:27:08] i knew then that it was a vision and
[3:27:10] then
[3:27:12] when i when i come into the vision again
[3:27:14] it seems that
[3:27:17] i was lifted up
[3:27:20] sitting
[3:27:21] a highway a narrow highway with some
[3:27:24] brother
[3:27:26] i never knew who the brother was i look
[3:27:28] around
[3:27:30] now
[3:27:31] i'm sure and i know this is a vision the
[3:27:35] lord god is here
[3:27:37] and seems like everybody was afraid
[3:27:42] everybody so afraid of
[3:27:45] and a voice came and said
[3:27:48] there is such danger in these days
[3:27:53] there is a great heavier stains
[3:27:58] there's death
[3:27:59] when it strikes you
[3:28:01] [Music]
[3:28:03] and i heard the weed mashing down in a
[3:28:06] log and here come a huge muscle snake
[3:28:10] crawling through the weeds i thought now
[3:28:14] ignoring this is a vision
[3:28:16] then i said then then i shall see
[3:28:19] knowing this is a vision i shall see
[3:28:22] what this animal all
[3:28:24] this beast is now he's he's trying to
[3:28:27] give us biblical symbol this animal
[3:28:30] representing a beast a beast is a power
[3:28:34] in the bible and he crawl up on the
[3:28:37] highway and as soon as i i got a sight
[3:28:42] of him i knew it was a mamba
[3:28:44] now a mamba is an african snake which is
[3:28:48] which is the most
[3:28:50] daily bite of all things there is
[3:28:54] there is nothing
[3:28:55] as person as person as a mamba and the
[3:28:59] snake of course represents sin
[3:29:02] the snake represents sin the snake
[3:29:05] represents death
[3:29:07] [Music]
[3:29:08] but
[3:29:09] this in nature represent power
[3:29:13] so a power of sin and death
[3:29:16] that is approaching something dangerous
[3:29:19] we're living in dangerous time
[3:29:23] [Music]
[3:29:25] and year he was on the highway i taught
[3:29:28] so i looked at him and he looked angry
[3:29:31] at me
[3:29:32] and and he like his tongue and here he
[3:29:35] comes and and when he got right close
[3:29:38] he run up fast and then
[3:29:41] he would get closer and closer
[3:29:44] [Music]
[3:29:46] and just wave out and stop and then
[3:29:49] something will haul him off
[3:29:52] he couldn't bite me
[3:29:55] and he did turn around to the other side
[3:29:58] and try to approach this side
[3:30:01] and he did get back
[3:30:04] and get a stat
[3:30:07] right towards me and get slower and
[3:30:10] slower and slower and then he will stop
[3:30:13] and then just
[3:30:15] shake like that and move back
[3:30:18] he could instruct me now brother brandon
[3:30:20] watching this video vision just like
[3:30:22] looking
[3:30:24] at
[3:30:25] a movie
[3:30:26] praise the lord
[3:30:27] just like watching the movie then he and
[3:30:30] he's seeing this big deal snake
[3:30:32] you know coming closer to him and and
[3:30:34] then for off of a sudden it would just
[3:30:36] stop and then it would go back
[3:30:38] and uh it would try to find another way
[3:30:41] again and start creeping on him a little
[3:30:44] bit and as he come closer it would just
[3:30:46] stop and it would go back he's watching
[3:30:48] this thing in a vision
[3:30:52] praise the lord
[3:30:53] [Music]
[3:30:56] then he turned and looked at my friend
[3:30:59] and the way he went after my friend and
[3:31:02] i seen my friend
[3:31:03] just jumping way in the air over him and
[3:31:07] over him and over him trying and i think
[3:31:10] was tracking at him i thought
[3:31:12] oh if it ever hits him
[3:31:16] it's
[3:31:16] it will be instant death
[3:31:19] no wonder
[3:31:20] everybody is so scared
[3:31:23] because
[3:31:24] when this thing hits you
[3:31:27] is an instant death
[3:31:29] and it was and it was just striking at
[3:31:32] him like that
[3:31:34] and
[3:31:36] i threw
[3:31:37] my hands up i said oh god have mercy on
[3:31:40] my brother
[3:31:41] [Music]
[3:31:43] i said if that serpent ever struck him
[3:31:45] it would kill him and just then the
[3:31:47] serpent turned to me
[3:31:50] when i said that and look at me again
[3:31:53] and the voice
[3:31:55] came from above and said you have been
[3:31:57] given power
[3:31:59] to bound him
[3:32:02] praise the lord
[3:32:04] the word sin inning and i said well god
[3:32:07] what must i do he said there is one
[3:32:10] thing
[3:32:11] you must do
[3:32:12] you must be more
[3:32:14] sincere
[3:32:18] you have been given power
[3:32:20] but to use their power
[3:32:23] you must be more sincere
[3:32:26] [Music]
[3:32:29] you must be more sincere
[3:32:32] and i say well god
[3:32:35] forgive
[3:32:37] me for my own sincerity
[3:32:39] [Music]
[3:32:41] and let me have sincerity
[3:32:44] and when i raise up my hands to him
[3:32:47] again
[3:32:48] there was a great something came over me
[3:32:52] just
[3:32:53] lifted me up seemed like that my whole
[3:32:56] body was charged with something
[3:33:00] praise the lord
[3:33:01] [Music]
[3:33:05] and i look at the serpent and then he
[3:33:08] and then he started to wash me
[3:33:12] and he couldn't do it yet and i said
[3:33:15] satan
[3:33:16] in the name of the lord jesus christ i
[3:33:18] bound you
[3:33:20] [Music]
[3:33:22] and a serpent
[3:33:23] a blue smoke flew out of him
[3:33:27] and he crawled up and made a sign
[3:33:29] of an s
[3:33:30] capital s
[3:33:33] made backwards
[3:33:35] just like the sound of an end
[3:33:38] conjunction which means
[3:33:40] bound this one
[3:33:42] all
[3:33:43] anything below him praise the lord
[3:33:50] now so
[3:33:52] he goes on and he narrates
[3:33:55] the vision we're getting close to our
[3:33:57] time here of praying
[3:34:02] but just to realize
[3:34:04] he's having
[3:34:06] a vision of crossing over into the
[3:34:09] promised land
[3:34:12] of guarding over
[3:34:15] and yeri's head
[3:34:18] the vision repeats
[3:34:21] with a second
[3:34:23] a power a beast
[3:34:27] that is trying to stop him from getting
[3:34:29] over
[3:34:30] into the promised land
[3:34:32] now out of this
[3:34:33] vision comes with the changing of the
[3:34:36] ministry
[3:34:39] this was about going into the territory
[3:34:41] the full promise
[3:34:43] of the word
[3:34:47] you know when
[3:34:48] and
[3:34:49] just to cop a little bit with some of
[3:34:51] the things that the brother said
[3:34:54] [Music]
[3:34:55] if you if you read
[3:34:57] all the supernatural things that happen
[3:34:59] right
[3:35:00] around the opening of the seals
[3:35:03] heavyweight boys receiving their
[3:35:04] salvation
[3:35:06] but brandon says in half an hour
[3:35:09] those boys were down crying
[3:35:11] the resurrection of the little fish in
[3:35:13] half an hour
[3:35:15] he says when i say little fish i give
[3:35:17] you back your life he said in half an
[3:35:19] hour the little fish started wiggling
[3:35:21] the tails and it was gone
[3:35:25] speaking of the scars they all come
[3:35:28] in
[3:35:29] in half an hour
[3:35:30] [Music]
[3:35:36] we know we have a spiritual promise
[3:35:38] [Music]
[3:35:42] and yeah he said that we about to cross
[3:35:44] from one year into another
[3:35:47] [Music]
[3:35:52] in no way can that be compared to our
[3:35:54] spiritual promise but you think about it
[3:35:56] now
[3:35:58] if we would get power
[3:36:00] to be able
[3:36:02] to bring our body in subjection to the
[3:36:04] word of god if there is something that
[3:36:07] you struggling with
[3:36:08] in your life
[3:36:11] maybe it's temper
[3:36:12] maybe it's a habit
[3:36:17] for you to be able to have power over
[3:36:19] that daily thing
[3:36:21] that is always making you miserable
[3:36:23] always making you to regret
[3:36:26] there is one thing the word of god
[3:36:28] required of us
[3:36:30] is to be more sincere
[3:36:33] is god that with sincerity
[3:36:37] praise the lord amen
[3:36:39] he have the skill that with sincerity
[3:36:42] is now what you think
[3:36:44] it's not what i think
[3:36:49] if we will ever get on the other side
[3:36:52] if this coming year will be the year
[3:36:54] where we will have victory
[3:36:56] over lust
[3:37:00] praise the lord
[3:37:03] if this is the year where we will have
[3:37:05] victory
[3:37:09] over the things that the enemy is using
[3:37:11] to create condemnation
[3:37:14] to make us discouraged
[3:37:18] there is one thing we can yield
[3:37:19] ourselves to
[3:37:20] [Music]
[3:37:21] god make me more sincere
[3:37:25] praise the lord
[3:37:27] now you have to remember that before
[3:37:28] brother branham first commissioned
[3:37:31] the angel of the lord told him if you
[3:37:33] will be sincere
[3:37:34] [Music]
[3:37:36] there's nothing we stand before your
[3:37:38] prayer
[3:37:39] and now this is just before
[3:37:42] growing into
[3:37:44] the fullness of the ministry year is
[3:37:46] here again god is requiring more
[3:37:49] sincerity
[3:37:53] praise the lord
[3:37:56] as a church
[3:37:59] if there is one thing that i want from
[3:38:02] god for this church
[3:38:04] is for us to be sincere
[3:38:08] if god will just deal with our hearts
[3:38:11] and make us sincere
[3:38:13] [Music]
[3:38:14] sincere to the word
[3:38:18] not coming for showmanship
[3:38:20] [Music]
[3:38:23] not coming to please
[3:38:24] somebody but because we want more of him
[3:38:28] in our life
[3:38:30] praise the lord
[3:38:32] can you
[3:38:33] join me tonight
[3:38:36] and ask the lord
[3:38:37] god make me more sincere

[4:26:19] things are done
[4:26:21] praise the lord
[4:26:22] but just bear with us that's that's how
[4:26:24] you met us
[4:26:26] we are striving for the lord to be able
[4:26:28] to help us praise the lord but i also
[4:26:30] want to say
[4:26:32] as
[4:26:34] as the pastor of the church
[4:26:36] i'm very
[4:26:39] grateful and i'm very proud
[4:26:41] to be able to have the
[4:26:44] the
[4:26:45] the privilege
[4:26:47] to be able to do
[4:26:49] the commencement service
[4:26:52] of
[4:26:53] two of the saints that has come to this
[4:26:55] church
[4:26:59] you know there is something when you
[4:27:00] know
[4:27:01] that a brother or the sister is
[4:27:03] struggling
[4:27:06] and they are in and out and and their
[4:27:08] different things are happening in their
[4:27:10] life and and then it's more
[4:27:11] heartbreaking again if they are not
[4:27:13] serious about the things of god they
[4:27:15] just laugh they just calm
[4:27:17] you know they just joke about it
[4:27:20] sometimes when it comes down to
[4:27:23] their death
[4:27:25] it becomes
[4:27:26] a difficult message to preach i rather
[4:27:28] just preach to the living and then
[4:27:31] forget about that person because i will
[4:27:33] not want to bear fall witness
[4:27:36] but it's also a peaceful thing when you
[4:27:39] know what a man or a woman is standing
[4:27:41] with god
[4:27:43] when you know the life that they have
[4:27:44] left
[4:27:46] so
[4:27:47] just like how
[4:27:49] i counted the privilege to dedicate the
[4:27:51] many babies that we have dedicated a few
[4:27:54] not many we're looking for more
[4:27:58] and also to be able to do
[4:28:01] a few weddings that i've had the
[4:28:03] privilege to do
