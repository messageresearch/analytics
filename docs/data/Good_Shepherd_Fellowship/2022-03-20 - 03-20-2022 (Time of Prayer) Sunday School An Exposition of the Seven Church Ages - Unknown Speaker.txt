========================================
[Music] so [Music] these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth oh how beautiful are those words how majestic is even the sound of them how thrilling to think that all those attributes can be applied to one person who would dare to say such things about himself but jesus christ the lord of glory i believe the key to interpreting exactly what each of these wonderfully descriptive phrases means is found in verse nine behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee i say this verse is the key because it deals with the jews who have always called themselves the children of god to the exclusion of everyone else they crucified and killed the lord jesus christ their terrible deed brought their own blood upon their own heads for centuries all because they refused jesus as their messiah which indeed he was to them he was not the coming one or the son of david to them he was beelzebub or some unrighteous one fit only for destruction but not so he was indeed emmanuel god manifest in the flesh he is indeed messiah surely he was exactly as he now sets himself forth to be there he is the same jesus jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever that holy one in the midst of the lamp stands is the very same jesus who walked the shores of galilee who healed the sick who raised the dead and who in spite of irrefutable proof was crucified and killed but he arose again and is seated at the right hand of the majesty on high the jews did not call him holy then they do not call him holy now but he is the holy one psalms 16 10 for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption they sought their righteousness after the law and failed miserably for by the law can no flesh be justified by the law can no man be made holy holiness is of the lord first corinthians 1 30 but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption second corinthians 5 21 be that we might be made the righteousness of god in him it was christ or perish and they perished for they refused him and men of that age as even today were making the same mistake as the jews took refuge in the synagogue form of worship so in the philadelphian age they were taking refuge in the church it is not joining a church that counts the life is not in the church the life is in christ this is the record that god hath given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son hath not life man is made holy by the spirit it is the spirit of holiness that raised jesus from the dead that indwells us and makes us holy with his holiness there he stands the holy one and we will stand with him clothed in his righteousness holy with his holiness now this age is the sixth age in the eyes of god time is drawing to a close he will soon be coming back soon the cry will go forth as he comes and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still revelation 22 11 be oh i am so glad that my holiness is not of myself i am glad that i am in christ with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yea imparted unto me blessed be god forever these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense that it is opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization for example we recall that jesus said in john 6 32 moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven john 15 1 i am the true vine hebrews 9 24 for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us first john 2 8 because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as illustrated in these verses we can now understand as never before anti-type contrasted with type and substance with shadow take the example now of manna from heaven god sent down angel bread from heaven for israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day if it was left around it became contaminated but jesus is the true bread from heaven whereof manna was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came from heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here is the whole of it just like jesus isn't a part of god he is god no one could deny that israel had light they were the only people who had light as a nation it was as when egypt was so dark that one could feel it but in the homes of the israelites there was light but now true light is come the light of the world is jesus moses and the prophets brought the light by means of the scripture relative to the messiah thus israel had light but now the fulfillment of the light has come and what was but glowing word has now broken forth in the brightness of god manifested amongst his people as the pillar of fire gave light at night and that was wonderful now light and life were manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily israel used to take the red heifer and sacrifice her upon the altar for the remission of sins for a year the sins of the guilty one was covered but that covering could not take away the desire for sin it was not a perfect offering it was a shadow until the reel came along so each year the man would sacrifice and each year come back because he still had the same desire to sin the life of the animal atoned for his sin but being animal blood that was shed and animal life that was given it could not come back upon the man if it had come back it still would not have availed but when christ the perfect substitute was given and his blood was shed then the life that was in christ came back upon the repentant sinner and that life being the perfect life of christ sinless and righteous then the guilty one could go free for he had no desire to sin the life of jesus had come back upon him that is what is meant in romans 8 2. the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death but the jews back there in the time of jesus did not want to accept that sacrifice the blood of bulls and goats made nothing perfect it was once god's ordained method but now christ having appeared in the flesh and by the shedding of his own blood has put away sin and by that offering of himself has made us perfect the jews would not take that but what about that philadelphian age and yes the other ages too did they really accept this reality in christ no sir even though luther brought the truth of justification the romish church and its eastern counterpart the orthodox church still clung to works now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it is christ or perish and it is not even christ and works it is christ alone this age began the years of armenianism that does not believe in christ as the reality it does not sing of nothing but the blood for it sings of nothing but the blood and my own conduct now i believe in good conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not jesus plus it is jesus alone salvation is of the lord from start to finish it is all god let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that heal me let it be jesus and jesus alone not by works of righteousness which i have done no sir christ is my life amen i feel i could just go on and on about these truths but i will give you one more thought it is about that wonderful hymn that a b simpson wrote once it was the blessing now it is the lord once it was the feeling now it is his word once his gift i wanted now the giver own once i sought for healing now himself alone all in all forever jesus will i sing everything in jesus and jesus everything there isn't anything in this life satisfying as it may be as good and as fine as it may be but you will find the sum total of all perfection in christ everything fades into insignificance beside him he that hath the key of david this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true christ the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization here it is moses was a prophet of god but jesus like unto moses was the prophet of god david a man after god's own heart was king of israel but jesus is the greater david king of kings and lord of lords god very god now david was born of the tribe of judah out of whom no priests came yet he ate of the shoe bread reserved for priests he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as king he sat on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful type of christ now it says in isaiah 22 22 and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open the spirit uses this old testament reference concerning the lord jesus christ and his ministry in the church what the key of david signified at that time is mere shadow which is now fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stands it has to do with our lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage but what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men for the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has that right but jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does shoulder have to do with it read isaiah 9 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the key of david god being sovereign he for knew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for christ is the head of his church as sarah called abraham lord even so the bride is happy that he is her lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight but have men heeded this truth have they esteemed his person who alone has the full sovereign authority over his church i say no for in every age the church has been governed by a hierarchy a priesthood an apostolic succession closing the door of mercy and grace to whom it will and instead of assuming the love and responsibility of the church it has with mercenary lust preyed upon her and destroyed her the clergy lived in luxury while the poor church fed on the husks of abuse and not one age did any different each bound itself to organization and put the government upon men and committed the church to that government there let the people rise up and they were brutally suppressed or cast out every denomination has the same spirit every denomination swears that it has the key to the government of the church every denomination claims that it opens the door but that is not true it is jesus and jesus alone he sets the members in the body he endows them with their ministries he puts the gifts at her disposal he cares for her and guides her she is his sole property and he has no other one but her what a far cry from reality is this church age in which we live and one day soon these men that even now purport to speak for the church will be rising up in the ecumenical move to place a living antichrist at the head of their organization which deposes the lord and we will find him christ outside the church saying behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me revelation 3 20 but let me say this our lord is not defeated men claim to open the door to god and shut that door but they are liars all that the father has given him will come to him and he that cometh to him in no wise will be cast out he will lose none of them john 6 37-39 and when that last elected member to the body of christ comes in then will our lord appear the key of david was not david the king of israel all israel and is not jesus the son of david according to the fact that he will sit upon the throne of david in the millennium and reign and rule over his heritage surely so the key of david signifies that it is jesus who will bring in the millennium he who has the keys to death and hell will raise up his own that they may share in his reign of righteousness upon the earth how wonderful that our lord has all the answers truly in him are all the promises of god fulfilled truly by being in him we are heirs to what he has purchased for us yes there he stands the lord of glory once as the father he was surrounded by the angels the archangels the cherubims and seraphims and the whole host of heaven crying holy holy holy is the lord god of hosts such was his holiness that no man could approach unto him but now we see him in the church sharing his own holiness with us until in him we have become the very righteousness of god yes and there he stands jesus perfect everything lily of the valley the bright and mourning star the fairest of ten thousand alpha and omega root and offspring of david father son and holy ghost the all and in all isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace in him is perfect fulfillment but once we esteemed him not now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of glory in the midst of the church he stands and we will sing his praise for he the mighty conqueror is head over the church which is his bride he bought that bride he owns her she is his and his alone and he cares for her he is our king and we are his kingdom his eternal possession now you will recall that at the beginning of verse 7 i said that verse 9 would help us to understand it i hope you saw what i meant jesus set himself forth as he that is holy true or the only reality the one with the key of david the one who opened and shut and that is exactly true those phrases describe him perfectly but the jews in his day refused him and all he was they rejected their savior and all he meant to them and the nominal christian has now done the same they have done what the jews did exactly the jews crucified him and then turned on the true believer the nominal christian has crucified him afresh and turned on the true church to destroy it but god is true and he who is above all will yet return and when he does he will show who the only now you will recall that at the beginning of verse 7 i said that verse 9 would help us to understand it i hope you saw what i meant jesus set himself forth as he that is holy true or the only reality the one with the key of david the one who opened and shut and that is exactly true those phrases describe him perfectly but the jews in his day refused him and all he was they rejected their savior and all he meant to them and the nominal christian has now done the same they have done what the jews did exactly the jews crucified him and then turned on the true believer the nominal christian has crucified him afresh and turned on the true church to destroy it but god is true and he who is above all will yet return and when he does he will show who the only potentate is and as he proves himself to the world and all the world bows at his feet at that time all the world will bow at the feet of the saints proving that they were right in their stand with him blessed be god forever the age of the open door revelation 3 8 i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast to little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name the first phrase of this verse i know thy works is analyzed in the rest of the verse for their works had to do with the open door little strength the word and the name in order to understand the wealth of meaning involved in behold i set before you an open door and no man can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age there is an overlapping a melting or fading into rather than an abrupt end and a clear-cut start this age particularly flows into the next stage and not only does this age overflow into the last stage but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the sixth age the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of pentecost once the philadelphian age has about run its course the laodicean age quickly comes in bringing both the tears and the wheat to harvest first bind the tears to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn matthew 13 30. remember please that the sardisian age started the reformation that must still go on until the grain that was planted at pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing etc until it comes right back to original seed while this is going on the tears that were sown will have to go through their cycle and be harvested also that is exactly what we see happening if you can just think of the seasons you can get a very good picture of this the plant that you see growing in full strength in summer suddenly appears to be going to seed you can't tell exactly when summer became autumn it just faded into it that is how the ages are and especially these last two it is to this age that jesus says i come quickly verse 11. that makes the last stage a very short one laodicea is the age of the quick work it is cut short now we will specifically dwell on the open door that no man can shut first of all i want to dwell on the open door as signifying the tremendous missionary effort of that age paul called a new missionary endeavor for the lord and open door second corinthians 2 12. furthermore when i came to troas to preach christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord so we can see by the comparison of scriptures that this open door signified the greatest spreading of the gospel that the world has ever seen i want you to see something here god works in threes doesn't he it was in the third or pergament age that the church was married to the state the deeds of the nicolaitans had become the doctrine of the nicolaitans that age was the open door for the false vine once it was backed up by the power of the state it became actually a world system even though it bore the name christian thus it spread like wildfire but now three ages later after a long and hard struggle of faith here comes the open door to the truth the word of the lord now has its day of course the fifth age had set the stage for this mighty move as that age gave us exploration colonization the printing of books etc it would have been wonderful if this open door had followed the divine pattern of pentecost which was set forth in hebrews two one through four therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will now you know that this is the pattern for jesus himself said so mark 16 15-20 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen he never told them to go into all the world and establish bible colleges nor did he tell them to pass out literature now these things are fine but what jesus told them to do was to preach the gospel stick with the word and then the signs would follow the very first introduction we have in the way the kingdom of god was to be preached was when he sent out the twelve in matthew 10 1-8 he commissioned and instructed them on this wise and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alfies and labias whose surname was thaddeus simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel and as ego preached saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give this ministry that he gave them was actually the sharing of his own ministry with them for it says in matthew 9 35-38 and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest now many people have the idea that just the apostles had this ministry given them by our lord jesus and so when they died the ministry was over [Music] you
