[12:22] [Music]
[12:29] Yeah, I've been down since Yesterday
[12:33] I have a coworker.
[12:36] We work in the health care you know as a
[12:39] health care they always say oh man
[12:43] reporter
[12:44] and
[12:47] it's hard for some of us from Africa to
[12:50] be reporting team especially when your
[12:54] coworker.
[12:55] Yeah.
[12:57] And mostly I'm the Lee on the old night.
[13:02] So
[13:03] I'm mother of boys. So all the boys they
[13:07] call me mama.
[13:10] Saturday night I took it out just to be
[13:15] to spend it with my husband for birthday
[13:18] and I asked
[13:20] one of my son there to work for me. So
[13:23] it were like two of my sons were working
[13:26] for overnight
[13:28] and most of the time if I'm not working
[13:31] when they are working I always call wash
[13:33] it back wash it back because I know it's
[13:37] hard for them to
[13:40] on the overnight so when I'm not working
[13:44] I can't sleep I keep worry about them
[13:46] checking on asking me but that night
[13:50] rather thinking of staying up something
[13:53] else happened
[13:55] yeah went to take care of one resident
[13:58] that is very difficult. They went high
[14:00] on everybody.
[14:02] But
[14:05] when they were taking care of him, there
[14:08] was a terrible things that happened in
[14:10] the room. And both of my sons were
[14:12] there. And one ready, they said the
[14:15] video was very bad. And the other one he
[14:19] found
[14:21] he he don't even speak good English. The
[14:25] French and the English mix up. But it's
[14:28] beautiful.
[14:30] So
[14:32] he watched the scene and he helped but
[14:34] because of that English word men
[14:37] reporter
[14:39] he he couldn't report and because of
[14:42] that get in trouble with the other one
[14:46] and usually when things that are
[14:47] happening is like three days report
[14:50] investigation but his own was just one
[14:54] day it just went that very day fire
[14:58] because of the video was very bad. And
[15:01] then my other son, he was in serious
[15:03] trouble. He been worrying and praying,
[15:06] asking God to help him.
[15:09] They suspended him yesterday. Today, by
[15:12] the grace of God, call him back to work.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; I just want to thank God for him
[15:17] &gt;&gt; and I also asking God to temper just
[15:20] mercy for the other one because he has
[15:24] been sent to the state and I know how it
[15:26] is. So I want to ask although I know
[15:31] it's not a good thing but I just pray
[15:33] that you guys will join us in prayer to
[15:36] for God to touch the heart of the state
[15:39] at least to less the penalty.
[15:44] Thank you. God bless you

[25:15] And he's more
[25:18] than enough
[25:22] for me.
[25:30] Praise the Lord.
[25:32] We want to thank the Lord for giving us
[25:34] another opportunity to be in the house
[25:36] of the Lord this evening and uh for
[25:40] blessing and keeping us while we were
[25:41] away from one another
[25:44] and uh uh
[25:49] around 7 8:00 this morning about yeah
[25:52] about 8:00 I was out on 35 and coming
[25:56] this way and uh uh I just I just saw a
[26:01] lot of movement of police vehicle
[26:04] and ambulance and I just felt
[26:09] so much in my spirit that there was
[26:11] something going wrong to see that amount
[26:14] of uh uh police vehicle and ambulance
[26:18] that was that was running at that time
[26:21] of the morning. I just I felt so much in
[26:24] my spirit. I said there is something
[26:25] going on and Lord whatever it is you
[26:28] just uh take complete control
[26:32] and uh and it was not too long uh that
[26:35] we learned there was
[26:37] uh school shooting that was done in the
[26:41] church. It was a Catholic church. I
[26:43] think they normally do have mass before
[26:46] the kids go to go to go to class or
[26:49] something like that. And uh uh
[26:54] Um and I think there were uh four lives
[26:58] that were lost and and there are some
[27:00] that are in critical condition. So we
[27:02] want to take that upon our hearts
[27:04] tonight and just bring it to the Lord in
[27:06] prayer. Uh brother Desimon has a uh
[27:10] spoken prayer request. We want to
[27:11] remember our brother tonight. Brother
[27:14] Era is asking uh prayer. He's having
[27:16] pain in his left arm and uh uh
[27:21] not knowing what what is what is causing
[27:23] the pain. So we want to take that
[27:26] tonight. Let's just bow our heads uh as
[27:29] we just uh uh
[27:33] be able to take these knees and and uh
[27:42] [Music]
[27:47] When you just think about uh the the
[27:52] time that we are living in and all the
[27:54] things that is happening around us,
[27:58] many of us we have uh we have grown
[28:02] under this grace. This grace that has
[28:04] sought us out. his grace that has
[28:07] favored us
[28:09] and many other horrible things that is
[28:11] happening out there. God has kept us
[28:13] away from it. Just like the children of
[28:16] Israel were in Gushing and the and the
[28:19] judgment were falling in Egypt. And many
[28:23] times is is it's not so easy for us to
[28:26] bring ourselves to the place to to
[28:29] really understand how horrible this word
[28:32] is. to be able to understand how
[28:38] there are
[28:40] blooding men and blood seeeking devils
[28:44] that are walking driving the same street
[28:46] you are driving and walking the same
[28:49] places that you are walking just in a s.
[28:54] So just think about it that this is the
[28:56] week where many little ones are going
[28:58] back to school
[29:01] and that uh that individual which of
[29:04] course he took his life after.
[29:07] But uh uh
[29:12] to just think about the many homes that
[29:15] are grieving tonight. To think about the
[29:18] pains that is in the hearts of mothers,
[29:21] grandmothers, fathers, siblings.
[29:30] if God would just help us tonight and
[29:32] and just bring ourself in and uh
[29:37] and be able to just say a word to the
[29:40] Lord on their behalf tonight that God
[29:42] will be merciful.
[29:44] I listen to a doctor report this
[29:46] afternoon also of one of the surgeon
[29:48] that is working on the on the ones that
[29:52] are critically wounded and by the grace
[29:54] of God trying to stabilize them. May God
[29:57] be merciful and be able to bring them
[30:00] out. But for many families, their lives
[30:03] will never be the same. Their home will
[30:06] never be the same again.
[30:09] Oh God,
[30:12] you are more than enough. Lord Jesus,
[30:15] Father, if we didn't have you, if grace,
[30:19] Lord, Father, have not come our path,
[30:21] Lord.
[30:23] And God, we can come this evening, Lord
[30:25] Jesus.
[30:27] Oh, precious Lord. Many of those people
[30:30] don't even know who to go to, where to
[30:33] turn to. Their little babies were killed
[30:36] right in a church mass.
[30:53] Let's pray together tonight. If we just
[30:56] want to say a word of prayer,
[30:58] we just want to ask God to be merciful.
[31:01] We just want to ask God to send comfort
[31:04] and that God will just help those
[31:07] hurting families.
[31:09] Let's pray together in Jesus name. Amen.
[31:13] Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord
[31:15] Jesus, oh God, we we just Lord Father
[31:19] God, stand Lord God, at our post of duty
[31:22] tonight, Lord, as your sons and your
[31:24] daughters, oh God, Father, precious
[31:28] Lord, we pray, oh God, and say, Father,
[31:30] Lord, just be merciful, oh God. We want
[31:33] to thank you, Lord God. Father, if we
[31:36] just want to know what a privilege we
[31:38] have, oh God, to be able to go out of
[31:40] our house and come in, Lord God, Father,
[31:44] not fearing anything, Lord Jesus Christ.
[31:47] It's not because, Lord, horrible things
[31:49] that are happening out there, Lord. But
[31:51] God, it's all because you have been good
[31:53] to us, Lord. Father, oh God, precious

[41:59] Mighty God,
[42:01] we are so much grateful unto you
[42:04] to be here again tonight.
[42:07] [Music]
[42:08] called to worship around the article of
[42:12] the supernatural,
[42:14] the word of the living God, Christ Jesus
[42:16] himself,
[42:19] being here and being anointed by his
[42:22] spirit
[42:24] on which mortality can worship the
[42:26] immortal God.
[42:29] The Lord,
[42:31] you expect that from your creation
[42:34] and we are so grateful. The Lord, we're
[42:37] a portion of your creation on earth that
[42:40] still have this consciousness
[42:42] of worshiping you, of coming to the
[42:44] house of the Lord, of laying aside all
[42:47] we counted to be so important to us.
[42:51] Father, be with us. We are here in the
[42:54] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. May we
[42:56] not live the same as you came in.
[42:58] Father, we have needs, we have requests,
[43:01] we have desires.
[43:03] Lord, maybe for ourselves, maybe for
[43:05] some relations.
[43:07] On today we hand over those and Lord,
[43:10] you smile upon them in the name of the
[43:12] Lord Jesus Christ be with us tonight. On
[43:16] today I commit the pastor of this church
[43:19] again and the helpers, the deacons and
[43:22] the officers, every member take charge,
[43:26] Lord of their life, soul, spirit and
[43:29] body.
[43:31] We are grateful because you've heard us.
[43:34] Lord, if there be any sin in our midst
[43:36] tonight, iniquity, unconfessed sin,
[43:39] Lord, sin of omission, whatever it might
[43:41] be, transgression,
[43:43] but the authority of the blood of the
[43:44] lamb and the love that the blood that
[43:47] was shed on Calvary released, we plead
[43:50] for mercy and pardon in the name of the
[43:53] Lord Jesus Christ. Give us our blessing
[43:56] and our release tonight. Father, may the
[43:59] world have a free course in our midst on
[44:02] today we commit this service by pass of
[44:05] clay and speak life unto your people.
[44:09] Thank you for touching your daughter,
[44:11] mama, Lord, and just bring her health
[44:14] and healing to perfection. Thank you for
[44:17] the daughter of the work you've done on
[44:19] her and bless the children and
[44:21] grandchildren, dear Lord, that keeps her
[44:24] comfortably.
[44:26] have your own way. Reward them in Jesus
[44:30] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[44:33] God bless you saints. You be seated
[44:38] for a while. We welcome us again to the
[44:41] house of the Lord
[44:43] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[44:46] I'm grateful to the Lord to be here one
[44:50] more time at this side of eternity.
[44:55] And as the pastor was saying, I just
[44:58] come around to see mama when I learned
[45:01] that uh she passed through some surgery
[45:06] and uh felt it would not be appropriate
[45:10] for me to be here without seeing her
[45:12] because she's fun of me somehow and I
[45:16] appreciate that.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:19] I came and saw her and she's not looking
[45:22] sickly only her body she's feeling weak
[45:26] and the places that the medical science
[45:29] try to maybe work on her but we are
[45:32] grateful to God.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I appreciate the son here. I
[45:37] wouldn't say son-in-law. I think brother
[45:40] one know is more than a son-in-law to
[45:43] that mama.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:46] Wonderful brother. And um
[45:49] The daughter also, sister Aaron, God
[45:51] bless you.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; The woman is not looking unckempt. Amen.
[45:57] She appears to be well taken care of and
[46:00] those things does not go unrewarded.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful to God that I know they
[46:08] still keep her with themselves. Maybe
[46:12] some old people's home. I don't know
[46:14] whether she will still be alive by now.
[46:18] But there's something about the warmth
[46:20] of your loved ones.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. You see the people that are your
[46:25] blood. You see the people that bite your
[46:27] intestine, maybe your child, your
[46:30] grandchild, your great grand. It gives
[46:32] some sort of comfort
[46:34] &gt;&gt; and for strange people to be surrounding
[46:37] you and then on the night of emergency
[46:40] they call you rush rush rush. So so
[46:44] good. And uh God bless them.
[46:47] I appreciate him also as a friend.
[46:50] Hallelujah.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; And I appreciate your support every time
[46:53] we come here and the reception we also
[46:57] have from the church. God bless you. And
[47:01] um if you don't receive even if you want
[47:03] us to be here, if you don't want us, we
[47:05] can be here. That is how it goes. I
[47:08] thank you for your love and I want to
[47:11] encourage you again that you stay with
[47:14] your pastor.
[47:16] You love him from the depth of your
[47:18] heart.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Ronan said is the hardest job on
[47:22] earth, not one of the hardest job, the
[47:24] hardest job on earth
[47:26] &gt;&gt; is to pastor a church
[47:29] &gt;&gt; to prepare people
[47:32] to be ready for the coming of the Lord.
[47:34] To be qualified,
[47:36] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[47:36] &gt;&gt; for the coming of the Lord is a
[47:38] difficult task.
[47:41] And we were talking at home, you have to
[47:43] deny yourself of a whole lot of things,
[47:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:47] &gt;&gt; You know, you dedicate church members
[47:51] car maybe brand new. You dedicate their
[47:54] homes and maybe young was built in 1932
[47:58] and you dedicating a home that is built
[48:00] in maybe 2005 or 2020 home brand new.
[48:05] And you must not jealousy. You must not
[48:07] feel bad about it. You must be happy.
[48:10] that your church members are
[48:11] progressive.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; So that must it can only come from a
[48:16] heart that is pure.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Only come from a heart that love God,
[48:20] &gt;&gt; right? When you are sleeping. Sometimes
[48:22] we can't sleep. Yes. We just cannot
[48:25] sleep when you are sleeping. And
[48:27] sometime we sleep when you are awake.
[48:31] That is just how the ministry goes. You
[48:34] see, it's a work that you cannot
[48:35] predict. I didn't plan all this, but
[48:38] it's coming and I'm saying it.
[48:40] When we come here sometimes
[48:43] the grace of God just come down, we
[48:44] start talking. God bless you, brother
[48:46] Steve. Amen. And the wife, the scout,
[48:49] sister Joy, I saw you at the back. God
[48:52] bless you. I guess my brother, my friend
[48:55] Steve Woods is not here tonight. Is the
[48:58] wife around? Or maybe she's listening to
[49:02] Sister Tit and the family. God bless all
[49:05] our friends. We sincerely appreciate
[49:08] you. And um back home there we just know
[49:11] we have some people in Minnesota.
[49:14] Hallelujah.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; So God bless you. So friends that is
[49:18] just how it goes. The ministry is not
[49:20] what you can predict. You can't predict
[49:22] it. You can have a burden for a sermon.
[49:25] You come here the Holy Spirit change it.
[49:28] And there's nothing you can do about it.
[49:30] Sometimes you want to preach some
[49:32] sermons you feel is deep deep. That may
[49:34] not be what God wants for that
[49:36] particular service.
[49:38] And you must not be disappointed
[49:41] &gt;&gt; because obedience is better than
[49:42] sacrifice
[49:44] &gt;&gt; and hacken than the fat of rams.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; I was thinking I will speak on loyalty
[49:50] tonight but it does not click. So we'll
[49:52] speak on something else that brother Ram
[49:54] say you must be loyal to your church
[49:58] not just being loyal to Jesus Christ
[50:01] right you must be loyal to your church.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; And to be loyal to your church is to be
[50:06] loyal to your pastor. Right.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Right. And we in America,
[50:10] you must be loyal to your church. And
[50:14] loyalty, if you are loyal to something,
[50:17] it implies that you can die for that
[50:18] thing.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; As Americans, you love your country,
[50:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:23] &gt;&gt; I have it in my mind that every American
[50:25] is ready to die for the cause of
[50:27] America. So if you are ready to die for
[50:30] a physical nation, how much more
[50:32] spiritual nation?
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Something that have eternal reward. Not
[50:36] just a reward, eternal reward.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Rewards that lasted through eternity.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; It must be.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Is the hardest job on earth. Praise God.
[50:51] I said it sometimes ago when I was here
[50:53] that, you know, fasting may be easy or
[50:57] easier when there's no food to eat.
[51:02] But when you are surrounded with plenty
[51:05] and you have to leave the food, it shows
[51:07] a lot of commitment.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; You see, you don't need two people to be
[51:13] praying for you. One is enough.
[51:16] You don't need two people. One is just
[51:20] enough. A true shepherd
[51:22] that truly carry your burden.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; He does not let off. He does not let go
[51:27] until that thing is done. Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; And you can't see it and know.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; You can't know about it. It's not being
[51:36] discussed.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Even when it's done,
[51:40] he will go in the secret place.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; And thank God.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; That this is been taken care of.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you if I continue like this.
[51:53] And I wish I can continue like this and
[51:55] forget about what I'm bringing in here
[51:58] tonight. All right. So I appreciate all
[52:01] you all. Praise God.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; I guess Bridget is not here also. We're
[52:08] you know talking and laughing yesterday
[52:11] on a lighter mood. Thanks be to God and
[52:15] we appreciate her state. God will
[52:18] establish everybody.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody God will establish. Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Except you are not a child of God.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; But the time of the establishment
[52:26] differs.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Yours could be closer. Yours could be
[52:29] shorter. Yours could be farther. Yours
[52:31] could be like that. Yours could appear
[52:34] as if there's no hope.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; But not when you are truly serving God
[52:38] because we have a hope.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; That maketh not ashamed.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of hope we have.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So all is well because
[52:50] we have a message shalom. Greetings from
[52:53] whom? Every time they call say greet the
[52:56] church, greet the church. Every member
[52:58] of my family, my wife, they send their
[53:00] greetings. Brother Gideon, he passed
[53:02] here also. Greeting from him. He's
[53:05] presently in Colombia. You may be
[53:06] preaching tonight. And America is such a
[53:09] place that uh you can't plan yourself
[53:13] based on time because there are
[53:14] different time zones in one country. So,
[53:17] but we appreciate the Lord for that. But
[53:20] eternity to come, there will be no
[53:22] different time zones.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; There be one great big economy
[53:26] &gt;&gt; and Christ Jesus will be the king.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Shall we read from the
[53:30] scriptures tonight?
[53:32] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm looking at the clock. Uh,
[53:35] amen. Let's pray one more time from the
[53:39] book of Amos. Righteous Lord, we thank
[53:43] you for bringing us to the house of the
[53:44] Lord. Thank you for the comfort that we
[53:47] have being here tonight Lord Jesus. The
[53:51] relaxation we have in your divine
[53:53] presence. No tension, no pressure. We
[53:56] are grateful unto thee. Now we are going
[53:58] to the word of the Lord. Father, refresh
[54:00] us by it. I don't know anything. Lord,
[54:03] I'm a child. I cannot even speak. Lord,
[54:06] unto thee I yield my vessel that you
[54:09] speak life unto your people.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Take glory in Jesus Christ's name we
[54:14] pray. Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amos 3:7. First,
[54:19] Amos 3:7.
[54:22] It's a familiar scripture. Then we'll go
[54:24] to Revelation 13. Surely the Lord God
[54:29] will do nothing, but he revealed his
[54:31] secret unto his servant, the prophet. We
[54:33] see it. Thank you. Revelation chapter
[54:36] 13. The Lord God will never do anything.
[54:40] He will first of all reveal his secret
[54:43] unto his servant, the prophet. I love
[54:45] this scripture so well. Revelation
[54:47] 13:17.
[54:50] And while I was thinking of something
[54:52] else, this one did not leave my mind.
[54:55] Revelation chapter 13, we take you from
[54:58] verse one to three. And uh we just have
[55:01] the frame of one hour where we trust the
[55:04] Lord to help us. The Bible says,
[55:09] "And I stood upon the sand of the sea
[55:11] and saw a beast rise up out of the sea."
[55:16] A beast in the Bible, the prophet said
[55:18] represent power.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Right. And if you read the book of
[55:22] Revelation, because this same beast also
[55:24] came out in the book of features rather
[55:26] in the book of Revelation. As at the
[55:28] time that this same beast, this same
[55:30] power features in revelation, he has
[55:32] carry an institution.
[55:35] Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; To complement itself to spread its own
[55:39] influence and power all over the surface
[55:41] of the earth. But is the same power is
[55:43] the same beast. Is the same institution.
[55:45] It's the same demon power is the same
[55:47] spirit. But it is guys. So and I stood
[55:51] upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast
[55:53] rise up out of the sea having seven
[55:55] heads and 10 horns. and upon his horns
[55:58] 10 crowns, and upon his head the name of
[56:02] blessed.
[56:05] And the beast which I saw was like unto
[56:07] a low part, and his feet were as the
[56:09] feet of a bear. We still refer to this.
[56:11] And his mouth as the mouth of a lion,
[56:13] and the dragon gave him his power, and
[56:16] his seat and great authority.
[56:20] Hallelujah.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; I just want to pick out a piece from
[56:23] this.
[56:25] John the prophet said the book of
[56:28] revelation is a book of symbol. Yes,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; entirely symbolic brother. I'm saying
[56:34] nothing is written in revelation right
[56:37] directly out
[56:40] is like parable like visions symbols
[56:43] nothing is written directly like that
[56:47] everything is symbolic. Now this beast
[56:50] still leave it on the screen. You said
[56:52] beast represent power and he has seven
[56:54] heads
[56:56] and 10 horns and 10 crowns upon the 10
[56:59] horns.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; And the dragon, we know that Satan is
[57:03] the dragon.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Gave where is that verse two or verse
[57:08] one? We know that the dragon
[57:11] and um and I saw one of his heads and
[57:15] the dragon gave him his power. So this
[57:18] beast that is before us tonight
[57:22] is how exercising all the power of the
[57:25] devil. The devil vacated his seat for
[57:29] this beast to sit upon it. The authority
[57:32] of Satan, he deposited it in that power.
[57:37] He's on earth. He's not in heaven. He's
[57:40] not in. He's not in heaven. He's on
[57:41] earth here. Right now, let's go to verse
[57:45] three.
[57:47] We'll deal on one and three. And I saw
[57:50] one of his heads as it were wounded to a
[57:53] death and his deadly wound was healed
[57:57] and all the world wondered after the
[58:02] beast is a power.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; So
[58:07] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[58:08] word in Jesus Christ's name.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; We take Revelation 17 when we need it.
[58:13] We I don't know. We just call this the
[58:18] eighth Roman Emperor and its texture.
[58:23] The eighth Roman Emperor and its
[58:25] texture. Praise the Lord.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; We just titled it this and we just trust
[58:30] the Lord to help us within the frame of
[58:32] time that we have. We in the in this
[58:35] brother Renham says that uh he he
[58:38] preached a sermon I think twice titled
[58:41] the events make clear by prophecy.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said God always love
[58:48] to tell his people
[58:52] the events before they come to pass. He
[58:55] always love to post us ahead that watch
[58:58] this, watch this, watch this, watch
[59:00] that, it will happen. And we are
[59:02] grateful to the Lord for that. Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram says a prophet is not
[59:06] just a visioner. He's not only somebody
[59:08] is not somebody that just see vision and
[59:10] prophesy tell the future. He say he's
[59:13] not just a teller forth and a false
[59:15] teller. He say what vindicate a true
[59:17] prophet is because the word of the lord
[59:19] comes to him.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; That a true vindication of a true goal
[59:24] prophet.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Because we have herbalist that also see
[59:28] vision.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; They also divine. Right. They see things
[59:33] they can tell you your name without
[59:35] seeing you before. So that is not a true
[59:37] vindication of a true prophet of God
[59:39] because Satan does all that. All right.
[59:42] And um
[59:44] we
[59:46] yes
[59:47] if we go to I would leave this you say
[59:50] yeah what a prophet means let's show us
[59:54] the first picture that is the image that
[59:57] man we start from there tonight. church,
[1:00:00] we are living at the end time. There was
[1:00:03] a time that the end time began,
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron said the return of the Jews
[1:00:11] back to the back to Palestine is the
[1:00:14] beginning of the end. And now we are at
[1:00:17] the end of the end. There was a time the
[1:00:20] end began.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; But now the end has ended. We are at the
[1:00:24] end of the end.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:27] We are not at the beginning of the end.
[1:00:28] We at the end of the end. Everything
[1:00:31] that surrounds us shows that we at the
[1:00:33] end. And as believers, we are grateful
[1:00:35] to the Lord that we at the end.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And one day, the eastern skies will
[1:00:39] break open
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; and the son of God will peep out from
[1:00:42] the I mean from heaven. Hallelujah.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Of course, the message of the shout had
[1:00:47] already gone forth.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:49] and a voice of the resurrection that
[1:00:52] will awaken the sleeping saints
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; and the trump of the Lord will sound and
[1:00:57] the force of gravity will lose it hold
[1:00:59] upon us.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; And we rise with a change of body to say
[1:01:05] the everlasting price bidding farewell
[1:01:07] to this sin cause war.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; I was at home. He was out. I read on
[1:01:12] news back in his house you know shooting
[1:01:16] in uh in Minnesota.
[1:01:18] again killed two innocent children, two
[1:01:21] adults, wounded some other ones. Why?
[1:01:24] What have they done?
[1:01:26] Maybe some people are some people that
[1:01:28] are crazy are holding gun. They're not
[1:01:30] supposed to hold gun.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But by your everybody in America can
[1:01:33] hold on.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Give us a picture that first picture. So
[1:01:39] the world,
[1:01:41] the gentile world is divided into four
[1:01:43] different empires.
[1:01:45] Amen.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The gentile world is divided into
[1:01:50] four different empires right from the
[1:01:53] Babylonian kingdom.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Which was typified or represented by the
[1:01:58] head of gold.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; That was the beginning of the of gentile
[1:02:01] kingdom.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; And if something began remember it must
[1:02:06] end.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; We have a birthday. We also have a death
[1:02:11] day.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:13] Mhm.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; So now that was the head of gold. Then
[1:02:17] we have typified by the head of gold.
[1:02:19] Then we have the arms and breast of
[1:02:23] silver. The medipes kingdom took over
[1:02:26] from Babylonian kingdom. You know all
[1:02:28] that.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; We're only reminding you what you had
[1:02:31] already been taught.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; And then from that we move to the
[1:02:34] Christian empire. And when we are
[1:02:36] talking about empire, these were these
[1:02:38] were kingdoms. Hallelujah. These were a
[1:02:42] people that governed the entire world.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Babylon governed the entire world. The
[1:02:48] kingdom passed down to Mopacian. It
[1:02:51] governed the entire world. It pass down
[1:02:53] to Grecian Empire. They govern the
[1:02:55] entire world.
[1:02:58] Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; The Babylonian were in charge. The
[1:03:01] Mipian were in charge. The Grecians were
[1:03:03] in charge. But now today it has moved
[1:03:08] to the last phase of the gentile world
[1:03:11] which is the Roman Empire. And Roman
[1:03:14] Empire is divided into two phases.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; The pure mineral led of iron and the
[1:03:23] iron mixed with mar clay.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Those are the two divisions of
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; the Roman Empire. And that is the empire
[1:03:31] under which we are living today. We are
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; like it or not filled with the Holy
[1:03:36] Spirit or not filled with the Holy
[1:03:37] Spirit we are being governed by the
[1:03:40] Roman Empire
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; is under that that we are in.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; We have a limited time but not
[1:03:48] withstanding. So this leg of iron can I
[1:03:53] have something maybe like a stick even
[1:03:55] the drumstick I can use it. So that will
[1:03:58] not my image will not block this on that
[1:04:00] point. Give me the drumstick or any
[1:04:03] little stick that can go a little
[1:04:05] further. So church,
[1:04:08] Roman Empire is divided in two. The pure
[1:04:12] letter of iron which was imperial pagan.
[1:04:17] Thank you. Imperial pagan Roman Empire.
[1:04:21] I hope you are hearing me.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; This was imperial from here to here.
[1:04:27] Legs of iron, imperial pagan Roman
[1:04:31] Empire. There was nothing here called
[1:04:33] Christianity but pure paganism.
[1:04:37] Hallelujah.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you, brother. Yes.
[1:04:41] Thank you.
[1:04:43] Amen.
[1:04:44] From here the knee legs of iron down
[1:04:48] here that was the first face of the
[1:04:53] Roman Empire which was legs of iron and
[1:04:58] it was marked by pure paganism. And when
[1:05:01] we are talking about paganism we are
[1:05:04] talking about an institution that does
[1:05:06] not know God.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; An institution that does not respect
[1:05:09] God. An institution that does not value
[1:05:12] humanity,
[1:05:14] your friend, they kill you.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Human blood mean nothing to them.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; But it ended.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; And when it ended, it came down to the
[1:05:28] feet of iron mixed with mar clay.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Iron there is still that roish power.
[1:05:38] declared there brother say humanity that
[1:05:42] is everywhere man is found that roish
[1:05:46] spirit must follow it there that's right
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; even I don't know how will I put it now
[1:05:54] to the remotest village on earth don't
[1:05:57] be surprised that that roy spirit
[1:06:00] follows it there
[1:06:02] now we forge ahead by the grace of god
[1:06:06] so the word I mean gentile word is
[1:06:07] divided to fall. And now we at the last
[1:06:10] phase of this gentile power which were
[1:06:14] at the feet of the image of Daniel
[1:06:17] chapter 2. And you know what the two big
[1:06:20] toify
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; America and Russia.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Cruise chief and uh
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. You know all that by
[1:06:28] the grace of almighty God. So let's go
[1:06:30] ahead. Amen. And uh it looks like
[1:06:34] America and Russia are calling the
[1:06:36] shots.
[1:06:38] The America and Russia are just like
[1:06:42] pebbles on the beach.
[1:06:45] The main man that is calling the shot is
[1:06:47] the bishop of Rome.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Is the one that is calling the shot is
[1:06:54] the bishop of Rome. But he's doing it so
[1:06:56] hypocritically
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; that the world does not discover it.
[1:07:01] Thank be to God for the believers
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; because God sent us a prophet
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; with deep prophetic insight
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; into the Bible.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; He pull it out and we know that the
[1:07:13] seven seals has been opened.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; The covering of the devil have been
[1:07:18] unveiled
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; everything that covered the devil in
[1:07:21] secrecy in falsely in false everything
[1:07:23] is been pulled out.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; So the believers could see the devil
[1:07:28] like Satan today like this.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; And all that he's doing
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; because we are the
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; the bride of Christ.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; And the probability for a for I mean for
[1:07:40] the bride of Christ to be deceived is
[1:07:42] zero.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; You mathematician.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; The probability for a child of God to be
[1:07:47] deceived
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; zero.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; No probability
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; for a child of God to ever be deceived.
[1:07:55] Thank you Lord.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; He may go into this. He may go into
[1:07:57] debt. He may go into something into
[1:08:00] mockery into fun. A child of God
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; never ever
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; can never be deceived
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; because God knew the end right from the
[1:08:09] beginning.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; How can his child be lost?
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; So we are under this influence.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; I want to ask us a question. Who is the
[1:08:18] chairman of United Nation Organization?
[1:08:21] Who is the chairman of UN?
[1:08:25] Who is the chairman of UN? Who is the
[1:08:27] president of UN?
[1:08:30] You're supposed to know. You are people
[1:08:32] and you live in America.
[1:08:34] Praise God. Who is the secretary of UN?
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Is it Antonio Gutter?
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Gutter.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Gutter.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Now church. Who do you hear
[1:08:46] concerning UN? Is he a chairman or a
[1:08:50] secretary?
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; What do you hear?
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; We hear secretary
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; right now. How can the secretary head an
[1:09:00] institution like United Nation
[1:09:01] Organization?
[1:09:03] Come on, brother.
[1:09:05] Have we ever sat down or sat down to to
[1:09:08] to to think about that? Have you ever
[1:09:11] seen any organization that is being
[1:09:12] headed
[1:09:14] by secretary?
[1:09:18] There must be a chairman.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Or a president.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Or a leader of some sort.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; But UN does not have
[1:09:28] Hallelujah.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; In practice today, UN does not have a
[1:09:33] chairman. I say in practice, but in
[1:09:37] principle, UN has
[1:09:41] in principle, UN has a president. He has
[1:09:44] a chairman. Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; But in practice, he won't say it. And
[1:09:50] the chairman will never appear or behave
[1:09:52] or talk as if he's in charge. Brother,
[1:09:56] brother, say the pope is the one in the
[1:09:58] driver's seat.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Today,
[1:10:01] like it or not, he's the head
[1:10:05] of
[1:10:08] the gentile world today.
[1:10:11] Are you on Are you streaming the
[1:10:12] service? There's only your church that
[1:10:15] can access it.
[1:10:19] Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; All right. Honestly, that is why when I
[1:10:23] come to America, I don't like saying
[1:10:25] certain things. I just preach maybe
[1:10:27] evangelica. I just sufface something and
[1:10:30] go
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; preach brother.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. The pastor say I
[1:10:32] should preach.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; He's the word of the living God.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Brother say he is the one in the
[1:10:39] driver's seats. come and charge.
[1:10:43] Hallelujah.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And sometimes they cause the world
[1:10:47] economy to tumble.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Sometime they stabilize it. Sometime
[1:10:51] they scatter. Sometime they they I mean
[1:10:54] they rough on it. How can it be? World
[1:10:58] economy is collapse. The war collapses
[1:10:59] it.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Why should the world economy collapse?
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Our minerals are no more.
[1:11:06] Our minerals in the grounds are no more.
[1:11:09] The resources we get money from, they
[1:11:11] are no more.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; There are people in charge of this
[1:11:14] world.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; And you know it.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; There are people in charge of this
[1:11:18] world.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Now let's forge ahead. So now we are the
[1:11:25] food of this image. That is the last
[1:11:27] world empire. He moved from here to
[1:11:30] here. When he was here, it was pure
[1:11:32] paganism and he moved down here. Then he
[1:11:35] became a church. Show us the first
[1:11:37] picture. trusting the Lord to help us.
[1:11:38] Before you show us the first picture,
[1:11:40] let me read this quotes in um Mark of
[1:11:44] the Beast program 142. Mark of the Beast
[1:11:47] program 142. Mark of the Beast of 19 um
[1:11:52] God bless you, church. I'm feeling so
[1:11:54] good here. Mark of the Beast 1954.
[1:11:58] Let's see what it says. Amen. 1954. Like
[1:12:03] everywhere in the scriptures, from the
[1:12:05] beginning of the gentile, right? From
[1:12:08] the beginning of the gentile plumb back
[1:12:11] from Genesis. I can prove that Babylon
[1:12:14] begin in Genesis
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; and ends up in Revelations.
[1:12:20] Babylon began in Genesis, end up in
[1:12:22] Revelation, started out back there with
[1:12:25] Nimrod. The son of Ham through adultery.
[1:12:29] Babylon started
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; with Nimrod. the son of true idolatry.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; That was how that kingdom was ushered
[1:12:36] in.
[1:12:38] Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; But don't forget there was a time it was
[1:12:42] not okay. He say through h true idolatry
[1:12:45] to bring idols in
[1:12:48] to worship idols. There was a time there
[1:12:51] was nothing like idol worshiping on
[1:12:52] earth. But the moment the devil got his
[1:12:55] own seed on earth then problem started.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the devil poured down his own
[1:13:02] understanding revelation into the mind
[1:13:05] of his seed and from his seat the world
[1:13:08] you know is constantly being polluted by
[1:13:12] idols and errors and false teachings and
[1:13:14] all. Okay. So now to to bring idols in
[1:13:18] to worship idols list in church and it
[1:13:20] come right down through and and so
[1:13:24] cunning the prophet say and so cunning
[1:13:27] in the last days
[1:13:29] till it takes on the name of
[1:13:32] Christianity
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; and still adultery
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; at the end time the prophet said he came
[1:13:41] in so cunny.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; so smart. so shrewd,
[1:13:47] so sly
[1:13:49] that he came in the end time in the name
[1:13:51] of Christianity,
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; but he say still at the lottery.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; No difference.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; That's why I titled it the eighth Roman
[1:13:59] Empire
[1:14:01] with his and and his its textures.
[1:14:05] All right.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; And to continue by the grace of God. But
[1:14:08] the elector cannot be deceived. You say
[1:14:11] well my you say well my how the day we
[1:14:14] are living in the darkness that we are
[1:14:16] living in and men and women grouping in
[1:14:18] grouping about here in pagan darkness
[1:14:22] and don't even know it what a beauty but
[1:14:26] that's the day that we are living in
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; now church let's go back to revelation
[1:14:30] chapter 13 revelation 13 one be fast on
[1:14:34] the projector
[1:14:37] I will try and get the quotes but get
[1:14:39] the scriptures
[1:14:40] So he saw this beast coming out from the
[1:14:42] water and the prophet said even
[1:14:44] according to revelation 17 he say waters
[1:14:47] there means peoples we can't read it
[1:14:49] because of time you know it peoples
[1:14:51] tongues and nations
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; right
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; this power came out from among peoples
[1:14:57] tongues and nations everywhere man is
[1:15:00] being found
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; and he has seven heads the prophecy
[1:15:03] there's only one uh there's only one
[1:15:05] city on earth
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; that is built on seven hills
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; and that is Rome.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; It's built on seven hills.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; So the seven heads means seven hills.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; And brotherham, trusty trusty. It says
[1:15:21] the city of Rome that no city on earth
[1:15:24] is built on seven hills apart from Rome.
[1:15:28] And he said but Rome with her strict
[1:15:31] confines. Amen. He said the people does
[1:15:34] not realize that. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; We know that Rome Vatican is a city
[1:15:42] within
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; a city,
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; not a church.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Can the city of Minnesota or
[1:15:50] Minneapolis, right?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Can the city of Minneapolis send out
[1:15:54] ambassadors and receive ambassadors?
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Is she qualified?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Even the state of Minnesota is not
[1:16:02] qualified
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; to send out ambassador and receiving
[1:16:07] ambassador. But the city of Vatican,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; I think about 4,000 or I mean about
[1:16:13] 2,000 people. If I still get the
[1:16:16] population correctly, the population of
[1:16:18] Vatican is about 2,000 people in um
[1:16:21] Vatican. All right, let's leave that.
[1:16:23] It's about a thousand between a,000 and
[1:16:26] 2,000 people. She sends out ambassadors.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Then she receives ambassadors.
[1:16:34] You have ambassador of of Vatican in the
[1:16:36] United States. What was he looking for?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; And you have your ambassador also in
[1:16:42] Vatican. What was he doing there?
[1:16:45] I hope you are hearing me.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; How can a city assume the status of a
[1:16:51] country?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Vatican has their own flag.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Why don't you have your own flag
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; and let it supersede?
[1:17:00] So church
[1:17:03] in the beginning
[1:17:07] God completed the transformation of the
[1:17:09] earth. He went to rest. Don't forget the
[1:17:12] devil came.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; He took over this beautiful Eden and it
[1:17:16] became Satan's Eden.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; God's Eden had an echo.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Don't think if Satan takes it over, he
[1:17:23] also have an echo.
[1:17:25] So what do you think Vatican is?
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; What do you think Vatican is? Vatican is
[1:17:34] Satan's
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; headquarters.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And that is why he stays to govern world
[1:17:39] affairs.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Brother said she's in democratic
[1:17:43] nations. She's in the more despotic
[1:17:45] ones. Like it or not, she's in Russia.
[1:17:49] She's in China.
[1:17:52] Right. She's in mention it those police
[1:17:56] countries. Those police countries
[1:17:58] they're everywhere. And who can push
[1:18:00] them out?
[1:18:03] Roman Cali priest can enter anywhere I
[1:18:06] believe on earth.
[1:18:08] But let me carry our Bible under our
[1:18:10] armpit. Let's say we are going to
[1:18:11] somewhere who knows us.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; You see them in the airport. You see
[1:18:17] them here. They are well respected.
[1:18:20] Brother says
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; adultery at the beginning
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; he said but by the time it came to the
[1:18:25] end time it came so conny
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; that it put on the name of the church
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; right
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; and still at the lottery
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; to the call
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; so he has bring the scripture thank you
[1:18:41] seven heads and 10 I think we've said
[1:18:42] that in verse two the Bible says verse
[1:18:45] two it said this beast which he saw was
[1:18:48] like onopath
[1:18:50] The appearance, the skin, the color was
[1:18:52] the color of a lopat.
[1:18:55] And he had the mouth of a lion,
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; And he had a paw, the feet of a bear.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; One animal.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Combining the characteristics
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; of three other brutal beasts.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Lion is brutal.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Lopad is brutal. B B B B B B B B B B B B
[1:19:17] B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B
[1:19:17] B B B B B B B B B A E A A R brutal.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; So this beast and in Daniel chapter 7,
[1:19:25] Daniel saw the exact thing that John
[1:19:27] seen here.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Daniel said he saw him as the lion.
[1:19:32] Daniel 7, don't go there anyway because
[1:19:33] of our time. He saw him. He said he saw
[1:19:36] four beasts,
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; that strove on the great sea. He it also
[1:19:40] related the beast to water.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said the first one was, you
[1:19:46] know, was like a lion.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; The second one was like a lopad. The
[1:19:50] third one was like a bear. In verse 7,
[1:19:52] let's read Daniel 7:7 first. Daniel 7:7,
[1:19:56] you see what it says there. He said the
[1:19:59] fourth one was dreadful and terrible.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; He did not have any description for the
[1:20:04] fourth beast.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; No representation in the animal kingdom.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Daniel did not know what to call it.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; He said it looks dreadful.
[1:20:13] and terrible. He's not coming on. I've
[1:20:16] quoted a leave it. God bless you. Now,
[1:20:18] let's move on to something else because
[1:20:20] of our time. He say it was dreadful and
[1:20:24] terrible. So now that is to say this
[1:20:27] beast of Revelation 13:1,
[1:20:30] he combines the characteristics.
[1:20:33] Thank you. And this I saw in that
[1:20:36] vision, behold the fourth beast was
[1:20:38] what?
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; I want to hear your voice church.
[1:20:41] dreadful and
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; and strong exiting. That's the Roman
[1:20:45] Empire.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Is that Roman kingdom? Who do you think
[1:20:49] can defeat it?
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible ask said, "Who can make war
[1:20:53] with the beast?" He said the Bible. Who
[1:20:57] can make war with the beast?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Nobody on earth.
[1:21:02] Hallelujah.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; But there's coming a king, a warrior
[1:21:06] according to Revelation 19. Yeah,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; he would destroy her with a with a
[1:21:10] spirit with a sword of his mouth.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And here comes with him from heaven
[1:21:14] soldiers,
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; saints riding on white horses.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Do not literal horses."
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that can defeat
[1:21:24] the beast.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Who can make war with the
[1:21:27] beast?"
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Is a challenge in the scriptures,
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; brother. Nobody can fight it.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. America will
[1:21:35] not fight it. Russia cannot defeat it.
[1:21:40] No, no political weapon can defeat it
[1:21:43] because he's the head of politics.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; He's the head of politics.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; No. Okay. Look dreadful and terrible.
[1:21:54] Now he will forger. Uh yeah, he has the
[1:21:58] characteristics of lion, of bear and of
[1:22:01] loba combined. That is to say the powers
[1:22:04] of the first three kingdoms
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; is all gathered in that fourth kingdom.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Demon power. Who do you think rules
[1:22:13] Babylon?
[1:22:15] Who do you think rules Metropia? Who do
[1:22:17] you think was ruling in in the Christian
[1:22:19] Empire? And then who do you think is
[1:22:21] ruling now in the Roman Empire? You will
[1:22:24] see who is ruling. That's right. As we
[1:22:26] remind you again,
[1:22:28] we are living at we are living in the
[1:22:31] end time. Brother said the most glorious
[1:22:34] time for the church
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; and the most horrible time for the
[1:22:37] unbeliever.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; We can sing the song of redemption
[1:22:40] because our redemption drawer now.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; We are we are just about to be in fact
[1:22:47] we are free.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Not that we are about to be. We are
[1:22:50] free.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; We are liberated.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. So now revelation give
[1:22:57] us revelation leave that one dreadful
[1:22:59] and terrible all the powers of this
[1:23:01] other kingdom is combined. Don't forget
[1:23:03] also the devil is fighting us today.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; In the form of the pale horse rider.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Isn't it? And a pale horse is the power
[1:23:12] of the white, the black and the red
[1:23:14] combined to fight the bride. And God has
[1:23:17] given a corresponding power, the
[1:23:19] anointing of the flying eagle to combat
[1:23:22] that power. So we cannot be overcome.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; We are victors ourselves.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; So now give us revelation. Revelation
[1:23:32] revelation 13. Just leave it at verse
[1:23:34] two there. Hallelujah. So now he
[1:23:38] combines these other powers and uh the
[1:23:41] man of a dragon. The devil gave him his
[1:23:43] seat. So there's a seat for it.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; There's a throne for it.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's not hanging anywhere.
[1:23:50] There's a seat. There's a throne and
[1:23:53] great authority. Hallelujah.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; When UN was 50 years here in America,
[1:24:01] don't forget
[1:24:03] Revelation 13:11. That's your That's
[1:24:06] America.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; A lamb. I mean a beast like that had a
[1:24:11] little horn like a lamp.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Brother R said that's America.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Two little horns.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Brother R say
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; and ecclesiastical power.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Political and church power,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; government and church power. You can't
[1:24:26] run away from them. The only thing that
[1:24:28] can lift to above them is the baptism of
[1:24:30] the Holy Spirit is the seal of God.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Apart from that, brother, you can't
[1:24:34] dodge it.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; You can't dodge it. Who is not connected
[1:24:38] to civil power here? Who is not working
[1:24:40] here for the government?
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; You say no, I'm self-employed. You're
[1:24:45] self-employed. Who are you serving? Who
[1:24:48] are you serving?
[1:24:50] Now, leave the scripture on there. Just
[1:24:52] leave it on there so that I won't take
[1:24:53] time before you bring it up. Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; So, now let's go to verse three of
[1:24:58] Revelation 13.
[1:25:00] Excuse me.
[1:25:03] And I saw what?
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; One of his heads as it were
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; wounded to death. Not unto death.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Wounded to death. And his deadly wound
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; was healed. And all the world wondered
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; after the beast whose deadly wound was
[1:25:24] healed. Praise the Lord. Now brother Ram
[1:25:27] said this was when the barbarians in the
[1:25:29] church ages. This was when the
[1:25:32] barbarians onslaught that Roman Empire
[1:25:35] pure pagan uh pure that onslaught
[1:25:40] imperial pagan Roman Empire.
[1:25:44] Brother Von said there over 400 or about
[1:25:46] 400 idol temples in Rome alone. In the
[1:25:50] city of Rome alone there over 500
[1:25:53] temples to idols of idols in Roma. In
[1:25:56] the city of Rome alone over 400
[1:26:00] temples of idols. Now and his deadly
[1:26:04] wound was healed and all the world
[1:26:05] wondered after the beast. The prophet
[1:26:07] said this uh uh death blow or uh uh
[1:26:11] deadly wound was when the barbarians on
[1:26:15] slaughtered that pagan Roman Empire,
[1:26:18] right? And beat her to the ground that
[1:26:21] she was almost lifeless.
[1:26:26] That paganism was almost
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; lifeless. But in her wickedness, there
[1:26:33] arose a champion
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; called Constantine.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; There arose a champion.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Who pretended to be a Christian.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; But in actuality, he was a he was a
[1:26:48] pagan.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Adult worshipper.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Now, what did he do? He brought paganism
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; and Christianity. He had a dream, right?
[1:27:01] He saw the cross and he believe if if he
[1:27:03] paint the cross on the shield of his
[1:27:05] soldiers, he will win the election. And
[1:27:07] he won the election. Come on, church. He
[1:27:10] brought pagan.
[1:27:12] He brought pagans and Christians
[1:27:14] together. And Nishia council of 325 AD.
[1:27:20] Nisha is in the present day talking.
[1:27:23] You have access to those informations.
[1:27:25] Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Right.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; I say praise the name of the Lord.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Now church.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; That was when under Constantine he
[1:27:35] brought Christians and pagans together.
[1:27:38] I'm sorry now. And if you are having a
[1:27:41] reaction maybe chemical reaction when
[1:27:43] you mix two compounds or two atoms or
[1:27:45] two element together the resultant
[1:27:47] product will be different from the two
[1:27:49] component element you put together. It
[1:27:51] must be different. Yes.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; So when Christianity came to get married
[1:27:55] to paganism, he gave birth to something.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; And what he gave birth to was not
[1:28:02] Christianity. Hallelujah.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And it did not look like paganism.
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; He he mingled politics and religion. He
[1:28:14] brought church and state. He brought
[1:28:17] Christianity and idolatry. Mix them
[1:28:20] together. And he gave birth to
[1:28:22] something. What did he give birth to?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; You know the meaning of RC? I won't
[1:28:28] break it down now, but you know what
[1:28:31] means. Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Now, so Constantine
[1:28:39] was the catalyst that the devil used to
[1:28:43] achieve that goal. Let's go to
[1:28:45] Revelation 17. Now, the wounded head.
[1:28:49] That's when that pagan Roman Empire that
[1:28:53] was almost lifeless came back to life
[1:28:55] again. Right? That is the healing of the
[1:28:59] wounded head.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And Rome revived and became stronger
[1:29:04] than ever, more powerful than the pagan
[1:29:07] force.
[1:29:09] Say he rules today in every country,
[1:29:12] even to the despotic ones. Let's go to
[1:29:15] Revelation 17. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:20] All right. Thank God for the few more
[1:29:23] minutes we still have in here.
[1:29:26] Neil, and there came unto me one of the
[1:29:27] seven angel who had the seven vows and
[1:29:30] talk to me, say unto me, come either I
[1:29:32] will do what?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; I will show unto thee the judgment.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Of the great hall that does what?
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Seated of many words. Revelation 13:1.
[1:29:46] Where does the power power come from?
[1:29:48] From water.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; And by the time he comes to Revelation
[1:29:51] 17:1, he's now sitting on many waters,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; dominating the peoples of the earth,
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; except the one that has their name
[1:30:00] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; They are the only people that will not
[1:30:07] be deceived by this power.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; It's a power is a formidable power,
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; but not before the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:14] Verse two. Verse two says, "Whom the
[1:30:18] kings of the earth have done what?
[1:30:20] Committed fornication." When died, I
[1:30:23] followed. They followed the do on radio.
[1:30:27] Clint I think Clinton was there. I can't
[1:30:29] remember the president that was the who
[1:30:31] was ruling America then whether was
[1:30:34] Obama. I just cannot remember. Kings
[1:30:37] came from kings came from uh the land of
[1:30:41] Arabia from the Arab lands from all
[1:30:44] those Asian countries. Kings they
[1:30:47] literally knelt down beside the corpse
[1:30:49] of the pope
[1:30:51] literally including your president and
[1:30:53] ex-president
[1:30:55] of America.
[1:30:57] What has
[1:30:59] big political big week? who has
[1:31:01] political big weeks got to do with a
[1:31:03] pastor.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Is Pope not a pastor?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Is he not a pastor?
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; What has political big weeks
[1:31:15] got to do with a pastor
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; thanks be to God. Our eyes have been
[1:31:21] anointed
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; with eyes off
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; that we can see
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; and we are seeing.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; We are not blinded. We are not blind.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; yes. So, leave it, leave the scripture
[1:31:36] on there. Revelation 17. See what it
[1:31:40] says. Thank God. Whom the kings of the
[1:31:42] day have committed fornication, and the
[1:31:43] inhabitant of they have been made drunk
[1:31:45] with the wine of our fornication. That's
[1:31:46] adultery. Verse three says, yes. Verse
[1:31:51] three,
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; so he carried me away
[1:31:56] in the spirit into the wilderness. What
[1:31:59] did he see?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; And I saw a woman set upon
[1:32:04] a scarlet colored beast full of names of
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; having how many heads?
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; How many horns
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; is the same beast
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; of Revelation? 13
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; that has come here to Revelation
[1:32:19] 17.
[1:32:21] And as Revelation 17, Hallelujah, the
[1:32:25] beast is no more by itself. Uh-huh.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; She had carried a woman on her back on
[1:32:30] his back.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And the woman is a church.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; So now what happens or what happened?
[1:32:39] That pagan power, that pagan authority,
[1:32:43] that pagan rights, pagan rituals,
[1:32:47] hallelujah, was now hiding under the
[1:32:50] texture of the Bible,
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; under the texture of the church, under
[1:32:54] the texture of himnels, under the
[1:32:56] texture of choir, under the texture of
[1:32:58] white robes,
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; under the texture of tight and
[1:33:02] offerings,
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; under the texture of gang.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thanks be to God
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; for his mercies to us
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; through the message of the hour
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; revealing the secret of the devil to us.
[1:33:17] Yeah.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; So by the time from Revelation 13:1 it
[1:33:22] became Revelation 17:3.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; That same power carried a church.
[1:33:28] Empowering a church, financing a church.
[1:33:30] Hallelujah. Inspiring a church is the
[1:33:33] same demon power.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; The same evil spirit. But night has
[1:33:38] become a church with pulpit,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; with Bible,
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; with church members, with confession,
[1:33:46] with the cross, with Jesus.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, we go.
[1:33:52] No, in the old pagan Roman, in the old
[1:33:56] pagan empire,
[1:33:59] Nimrod, the wife's name was Amir. She
[1:34:03] when Nimrod died,
[1:34:06] she claimed that she had an immaculate
[1:34:09] conception
[1:34:11] that she was being impregnated without
[1:34:14] knowing a man because your husband died
[1:34:19] and then she put to birth. She named her
[1:34:22] son Thos,
[1:34:24] which is that same son God.
[1:34:27] She named her son Tamos.
[1:34:31] So now we had Seami that was being
[1:34:34] woripped in all Babylonian pagan
[1:34:36] religion and then we had her son that
[1:34:39] was also being woripped
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; in the old pagan Babylonian religion. So
[1:34:45] then when paganism became married to
[1:34:47] Christianity what happened it was so
[1:34:49] easy.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; They pulled down Samaria. No more
[1:34:53] calling Sam they were now calling Mary
[1:34:55] because it looks so fitting.
[1:34:57] They were now calling Mary and Jesus
[1:34:59] mother and son. It fitted their pagan
[1:35:02] religion.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; We only have one hour to deal with this.
[1:35:08] Amen. So fitted fit perfectly their
[1:35:11] pagan religion. Now they change their
[1:35:14] song God worship birthday to the
[1:35:16] birthday of the son of God. And that is
[1:35:18] why they took Christmas to December.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not born in December.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; He was born in March, April.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. How can we be celebrating
[1:35:27] his birthday
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; in the very month that he was not born?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; That was when that pagan power of
[1:35:37] revelation 13:1 that demon power hide
[1:35:40] under the texture of the Bible
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; and the whole world carries amen
[1:35:46] pastor bishop. I don't want to call that
[1:35:50] pastor now a bishop of this right
[1:35:56] you know you understand what I'm talking
[1:35:57] about
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; thanks be to God
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; that he open our eyes
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; that's the prophet
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; right now why we forge ahead so it
[1:36:09] became a church idolatry at the
[1:36:12] beginning beganism at the beginning
[1:36:14] idolatry paganism at the end but it has
[1:36:17] taken
[1:36:18] on the name of a church by the time you
[1:36:20] came to the end time. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:23] And none is the feet of iron mixed with
[1:36:25] maric clay. That's papal false Christian
[1:36:31] Rome
[1:36:32] is still a Roman power is a Roman Empire
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; and he's under that now wherein we are
[1:36:38] like it or not.
[1:36:40] Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; So now America is a superpower but
[1:36:44] America is under that power.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Every country under the sun is
[1:36:48] under that power and he knows how to
[1:36:51] achieve it. All right, I'm looking at
[1:36:53] the time now. If we go to steel mark of
[1:36:58] the beast, I hope we understand this.
[1:37:00] Revelation 13 became revelation 17 in
[1:37:04] Revelation 133
[1:37:06] and Constantine was a catalyst that the
[1:37:08] devil used to achieve that
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; to marry church and stay together. And
[1:37:12] the product was the Roman Catholic
[1:37:14] Church. I've said it now.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; It's a church, isn't it?
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; She has a pastor, isn't it?
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Does seem like a Christian church, isn't
[1:37:26] it? That's right.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; But you know what is behind it?
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; You have seen the power now that is
[1:37:30] carrying her is the power. Revelation
[1:37:32] 13. One, that beast, that power, by the
[1:37:35] time he came to Revelation 17, it has
[1:37:38] become purple, royal,
[1:37:40] rich,
[1:37:42] powerful,
[1:37:43] torture.
[1:37:46] So when they were saying Hillary Clinton
[1:37:49] will be the one that fulfill the six
[1:37:50] vision. How can Hillary Clinton fulfill
[1:37:52] the six vision? Brother say a most
[1:37:55] beautiful
[1:37:57] a most beautiful but woman.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Hillary Clinty was beautiful maybe when
[1:38:03] she was 18 20 but today she's a
[1:38:06] grandmother. Where's her beauty?
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm talking about?
[1:38:12] Yeah.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; But this woman, the Bible, the prophet
[1:38:17] said, "A most beautiful
[1:38:19] croy woman."
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Beautiful, brother. That church is
[1:38:23] beautiful.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; That church
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; is
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; beautiful.
[1:38:30] You go there. Golden altar.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. Purple color, red color, white
[1:38:37] color, silver color, golden color. and
[1:38:40] they have brilliant architect or
[1:38:42] designer that could mix those things
[1:38:44] together. See the class of cars they
[1:38:46] pack in their church compound.
[1:38:50] See the dresses the members wear.
[1:38:52] Beautiful.
[1:38:54] Let's continue. That's not our thought.
[1:38:57] Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; So it became a church.
[1:39:00] Mark of the beast paragraph 184.
[1:39:03] Paragraph 184. Let's see what the
[1:39:05] prophet says in here. Mark of the beast
[1:39:07] paragraph 184. Amen. Which says uh yeah,
[1:39:12] it says it the devils at the beginning.
[1:39:16] It the devils
[1:39:19] at the beginning and I can prove to you
[1:39:21] that the Bible said here all the word
[1:39:24] wonder after the beast's power which was
[1:39:28] which is not and yet is. How could it
[1:39:31] be? Was and is not. Let's continue with
[1:39:33] Revelation 17 before we come to this.
[1:39:36] Bring it out. Revelation 17.
[1:39:42] I think we'll stop our verse three. And
[1:39:43] the woman was already in purple and
[1:39:44] scarlet color and dealt with gold and
[1:39:46] precious stones. Do you see she's
[1:39:47] beautiful
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; impels and having a golden cup in a
[1:39:50] handful ofations and finess of her
[1:39:52] fornication. Verse five, and upon her
[1:39:55] forehead was what?
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Written.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Written mystery Babylon the Lord. Let's
[1:40:00] go to verse six. Verse six says, "And I
[1:40:03] saw the woman drunken." Let's go to
[1:40:05] verse seven. And the angel which said
[1:40:07] unto me, wherefore I will tell thee the
[1:40:09] mystery of the woman and of the beast
[1:40:11] that carried her, which has seven heads
[1:40:13] and 10 horns. The next verse, and the
[1:40:15] beast, yes, this verse eight, right?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. Verse eight says, the beast
[1:40:21] that thou saw west, right? Which is the
[1:40:24] same beast in 131 is the same beast in
[1:40:27] Revelation 17. And the beast that saw in
[1:40:30] the and the power that thou so and
[1:40:33] institution that saw west and the people
[1:40:35] that saw west or the person that thou so
[1:40:38] was
[1:40:40] and is not.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; How can a human being how can a beast?
[1:40:46] He was is not and yet is.
[1:40:51] Brother Ram says that the succession of
[1:40:54] popes.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; The beast that thou soest was and is not
[1:41:01] and yet is brother that the succession
[1:41:05] of popes and the beast that thou soest
[1:41:07] was the pope is alive and is not the
[1:41:12] pope die.
[1:41:14] And yet is they elected another one
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; that thou soest was
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; and is not and yet is.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the message of the hour.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; And shall ascend out of the bottomless
[1:41:30] pit.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. You see the connection
[1:41:34] of the Bible and go into pition. And
[1:41:37] they that dwell on the earth shall
[1:41:38] wonder wonder whose name hallelujah were
[1:41:41] not written in the book of the love of
[1:41:43] love from the foundation of the world
[1:41:45] when they behold the beast that was.
[1:41:48] Can you follow me? Can you say with me?
[1:41:51] When they behold the beast that was and
[1:41:54] is not and yet is
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; session of popes. That's the eighth
[1:42:01] emperor.
[1:42:03] Now we going let's go to the next verse.
[1:42:08] And here is the man which hath wisdom.
[1:42:10] The seven heads are seven mountain. Do
[1:42:12] you see the Bible? Now
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; on which the woman seated. The next
[1:42:15] verse verse 10. We do we we talk a
[1:42:17] little bit. And there are seven kings.
[1:42:18] We talk a little bit because our subject
[1:42:20] is the eighth
[1:42:23] Roman emperor and its textures.
[1:42:28] And there are
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; seven kings.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Seven kings.
[1:42:33] Five are falling. Now used to say five
[1:42:37] kings had come and ruled and died.
[1:42:41] Brother taught us these things. There
[1:42:43] are seven kings. Five are falling. They
[1:42:47] have come rule and died and one is
[1:42:49] ruling. No, as at the time of this
[1:42:52] writing of the verse, and one is, and
[1:42:57] the other is not yet come, and when he
[1:43:00] cometh, he must continue a short space.
[1:43:05] Hallelujah. Verse 11 says,
[1:43:09] "And the beast that was
[1:43:12] and is not
[1:43:14] even,
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; he is the
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; he is the age." Thank God for the
[1:43:19] prophet
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; that
[1:43:24] dissolve these things for us. Even he is
[1:43:27] the eight and
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; of the seven
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; is of the seven and goeth into
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; pition hell
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; going into hell
[1:43:39] and yet is a pastor
[1:43:41] with white cas
[1:43:44] amen
[1:43:46] with grace of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:43:49] love of God and the fellowship of the
[1:43:52] Holy Spirit go with you Oh,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; but behind it pagan power
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; by the scriptures.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; I believe we are believers here tonight.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; If you are not, you don't belong here.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Right. If you are not, you don't belong
[1:44:13] here. You'll be a problem for us
[1:44:15] tomorrow.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; And yet we need you here
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; because you must fulfill a scripture
[1:44:21] that a true believer must not fulfill.
[1:44:25] But we hope and believe that all of us
[1:44:27] are going to heaven.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; One thing I I don't like said it. I
[1:44:34] don't like it. Not that I don't believe
[1:44:36] it. Scaffold work. Scaffold work. You
[1:44:40] had a lot of scaffold when you were
[1:44:41] constructing this place.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Where are the scaffold today?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; They all gone.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; It's a form of believer. It's a form of
[1:44:47] church members.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; I don't like that thing.
[1:44:52] Now church while we forge ahead where
[1:44:56] did we stopped verse 11 right even he is
[1:45:00] the eight now let's continue let's see
[1:45:03] what the prophet says give us the
[1:45:05] picture the first picture the image that
[1:45:08] image of Daniel chapter 2
[1:45:12] give us fast sorry I'll still refer to
[1:45:15] this and refer to that
[1:45:18] amen he said the beast that thou sawest
[1:45:21] The beast was, is not, and yet is. This
[1:45:24] is
[1:45:27] this is the realm of the pure pagan
[1:45:31] Roman Empire minus defeat. Do we see it,
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; George? Do we see it?
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Again, now this was the realm that had
[1:45:40] the seven kings.
[1:45:43] It was a pagan imperial pagan Roman
[1:45:46] Empire. And there are seven kings.
[1:45:51] Revelation 13 is talking about Rome.
[1:45:53] He's not talking about Mopacia, Babylon
[1:45:56] and uh Grecian Empire. They have passed.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; He was dealing with the last world
[1:46:02] empire which is Roman Empire.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; If the if the Babylonian Empire had an
[1:46:08] emperor, the Christian Mipia had an
[1:46:10] emperor. This one had an emperor. Would
[1:46:12] this one also have an emperor?
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; And by the time he pass from feet to I
[1:46:17] mean from legs to the feet, won't he
[1:46:19] also have an emperor?
[1:46:21] He must have a king
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; and the Bible said that king is a king
[1:46:25] of the bottomless pit.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; So now revelation chapter 9. So now what
[1:46:31] are we say? This was the real
[1:46:35] imperial or imperial pagan Roman Empire
[1:46:39] that had seven kings. Amen.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Five are falling rule dead.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; One is the sixth. He was ready then and
[1:46:50] one is yet to come and when he come he
[1:46:52] must continue a short space.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in here one of those
[1:46:57] emperors was Nero.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; That rule that pagan Roman Empire.
[1:47:04] Brother said one of them was Nero. Let's
[1:47:07] consider Nero. Let's dissect him a
[1:47:09] little bit before we close very soon.
[1:47:12] Nero was he a kind man?
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Her
[1:47:19] brother say he was nasty. That was
[1:47:21] correct.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; He was what again? From another person.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Evil.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Nero was evil from another person.
[1:47:30] He was a murderer from me.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; He was what again?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Wicked.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; He was wicked. He was mean.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; He was bad. B A raised to power 1
[1:47:41] million.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Wicked. Emperor Nero,
[1:47:47] right?
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; He killed his mother. Yes or no?
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Children love their mama.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. See how brother one sister Harry
[1:47:57] we carrying mama with her. Even today
[1:48:00] she was going around. I said no hold my
[1:48:02] hand. Hold my hand. Even she need me to
[1:48:04] carry her. I still have the energy to
[1:48:06] carry her on my back. Put her where she
[1:48:08] will sit.
[1:48:10] She's mama grandma for that matter.
[1:48:14] Children love their mama. I love my
[1:48:16] mama.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Right. Sometime we confide in mama than
[1:48:20] papa. I'm sorry now papa.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Brother say children listen to their
[1:48:26] mama.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Oh you are hearing my African mama.
[1:48:32] To their mother. Yes. Children listen to
[1:48:35] their mother.
[1:48:37] But this one was so mean, was so
[1:48:40] heartless that she took the mother,
[1:48:43] whoever he used, she tied the mother on
[1:48:46] a horse
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; and she dragged the he drug the mother
[1:48:50] was drag all drugg round the city of
[1:48:54] Rome. Emperor Nero's mother was being
[1:48:57] dragged on the ground. You know when you
[1:49:00] touch somebody and the person is rolling
[1:49:02] on the ground the skins everything will
[1:49:04] be peeling
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; until the life left the body of the
[1:49:08] mother
[1:49:10] Emperor Nero. That was who he was.
[1:49:14] And that was what marked
[1:49:17] right the nature of those seven kings in
[1:49:22] the old imperial pagan
[1:49:26] Roman Empire.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Come on church. Now the Bible says the
[1:49:32] beast that sest was and is not and yet
[1:49:37] is. The Bible say he even he is the
[1:49:39] eighth.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; That is to say he's the eighth emperor.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; And he's of the nature of those seven
[1:49:46] kings.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Come on brother.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; That will not make us to remind us to
[1:49:52] know who is sitting in that
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; in that seat.
[1:49:57] the kind of a person today is an
[1:50:00] American but it doesn't matter he's a
[1:50:03] spirit
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; and so long as you are there on that
[1:50:06] seat that demon possess you
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; and you cannot help it
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; now church squeezes ahead of us
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; and is that same institution that bring
[1:50:16] the who killed Jesus
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; who tried to destroy Israel
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; right
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; and you think he won't do the same thing
[1:50:24] again
[1:50:26] Right? So he's the eighth
[1:50:30] king. He's the eighth emperor. And his
[1:50:32] nature, his characteristics, his manner
[1:50:35] of life, his way of life is of
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; the seven kings.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; When you say something is off. I'm of
[1:50:45] brother one. Brother one is of me.
[1:50:47] Right. Sister is of
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; brother one.
[1:50:53] So even he is the eighth the beast that
[1:50:55] has always that is and is not and yet is
[1:50:58] brother said that's the pop
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; right
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; even he is the eighth the eighth emperor
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; b of the servant let me read a quote and
[1:51:08] then we'll close in mark of the beast
[1:51:11] paragraph uh 20
[1:51:15] thank you for your time mark of the
[1:51:17] beast paragraph I will leave the rest of
[1:51:19] the quote paragraph 254 4. I don't know
[1:51:23] if they can bring it out together. If
[1:51:24] they can bring it out, we read it
[1:51:26] together. It'll be so beautiful.
[1:51:27] Paragraph 254
[1:51:29] of
[1:51:32] this mark of the beast.
[1:51:35] Look at what brother Rana was teaching
[1:51:37] in 1954.
[1:51:39] when people thought even to today some
[1:51:41] people believe that brother was not
[1:51:43] educated something he said he came out
[1:51:45] of uh came out of ignorance came out of
[1:51:48] this brother if anybody was intelligent
[1:51:50] and brilliant in church he was brother
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; so 254
[1:52:00] mark 540513
[1:52:04] if they can bring it up I would really
[1:52:06] appreciate it Now
[1:52:09] he will take the history and go right
[1:52:12] back and show it. Let me be slow a
[1:52:14] little bit. Yes, I'm looking at the
[1:52:16] time. If we will take history, He will
[1:52:18] take the history and go right back and
[1:52:21] show it where the kings had fallen in
[1:52:25] Rome
[1:52:27] since the Babylon religion.
[1:52:32] Brother say one is and in bracket he put
[1:52:35] Nero emperor N E R O Emperor Nero.
[1:52:41] One is remember the Bible say there are
[1:52:43] seven kings five are falling one is in
[1:52:45] bracket the prophecy that one is is Nero
[1:52:49] according to this book all right and one
[1:52:53] is to come and he must continue a short
[1:52:56] space remember Nero also burnt to Rome
[1:52:59] and laid the and held the Christian
[1:53:01] responsible for for for burning Rome
[1:53:04] meanwhile he was the one that did it
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen in the little documentary that you
[1:53:11] know I saw of him one time he was crying
[1:53:14] and maybe when room was burnt or
[1:53:16] something he was crying and he took a
[1:53:18] small bottle and he allows some tears to
[1:53:20] drop in that bottle he like say this one
[1:53:23] is for this and he said and this one is
[1:53:25] for that mean
[1:53:27] people that life doesn't mean anything
[1:53:31] right people that can suck out human
[1:53:34] brain and chew it raw
[1:53:38] behind curtains
[1:53:41] One is Nero and one is to come and he
[1:53:44] must continue a short space about 6
[1:53:46] months when he comes and the beasts. Oh
[1:53:50] brother say oh look at this
[1:53:54] he said now the power is going to take
[1:53:57] the pagan place
[1:54:01] the beast that is that was and is not.
[1:54:04] Brother said hallelujah. He said even he
[1:54:07] is the eight but he's of the seven. The
[1:54:10] prophecy said do you say he's going to
[1:54:12] take the pagan place?
[1:54:17] The only difference right between the
[1:54:20] legs of iron and the feet of iron met
[1:54:24] with clay. The only difference is that a
[1:54:26] church has been built on that power.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; That's the only difference.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit. It's the same
[1:54:32] power. Nothing has changed
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; now. Now God Almighty that office with
[1:54:38] the Pope God saw it as one his own
[1:54:41] office
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; said the kings come this one does this
[1:54:44] and does that he's gone he said but this
[1:54:47] one does not change and he will not
[1:54:49] change until Jesus come it must be pope
[1:54:51] in that office that's why the bible call
[1:54:53] it one the eth
[1:54:56] because one go another come inside one
[1:54:59] he say that power is going to take the
[1:55:02] pagan place paganism at the Beginning he
[1:55:06] say beganism at the end only today it
[1:55:09] has assumed the name of a church. God
[1:55:11] bless you church.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:55:24] From nearer
[1:55:28] nearer bless
[1:55:31] to the cross where thou hast done.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Draw me nearer,
[1:55:41] pastor. Nearer. Bless the Lord
[1:55:47] to the preious
[1:55:50] bleed
[1:55:51] in
[1:56:00] [Music]
[1:56:02] a bless
[1:56:05] to the cross
[1:56:08] where thou
[1:56:11] hast thou
[1:56:16] Draw me near.

[1:56:22] near a blesser Lord
[1:56:28] to thy preious
[1:56:32] bleeding
[1:56:35] side. Consecrate me now.
[1:56:38] on St.
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:47] Lord
[1:56:49] by the power
[1:56:52] of grace
[1:56:54] divine.
[1:56:56] Let my soul look up. Let my soul
[1:57:01] open up
[1:57:04] with a steadfast
[1:57:07] hope.
[1:57:08] Let my will
[1:57:11] be lost in.
[1:57:17] Oh Lord, draw me near
[1:57:24] the air. How blessed Lord
[1:57:28] to thy cross
[1:57:31] where thou
[1:57:33] hast gone.
[1:57:38] Oh drawing nearer,
[1:57:44] nearer of blessed Lord
[1:57:50] to thy preious
[1:57:54] living.
[1:58:00] Praise the Lord. Let me say this tonight
[1:58:03] and just encourage you. We thank the
[1:58:05] Lord for the word. It was beautiful
[1:58:07] word. Amen. I wish we had enough time
[1:58:10] for our brother to continue but uh just
[1:58:14] one word is enough. Amen. Uh sufficient
[1:58:18] of the dead is the evil dead. But let me
[1:58:21] say this and just encourage you tonight.
[1:58:24] you know uh that uh uh paganism that
[1:58:30] idolatry that has gone throughout the
[1:58:32] ages
[1:58:33] and uh uh that that has been the cause
[1:58:38] of every denomination.
[1:58:41] Every move of God was corrupted by that
[1:58:48] uh uh paganism power by that idolatry
[1:58:52] power.
[1:58:54] What we must re remember God called
[1:58:57] Abraham from out of idolatry.
[1:59:01] Our father Abraham the father of faith
[1:59:05] was called out of idolatry
[1:59:08] until we get out of here. One of the
[1:59:11] thing we will fight is idolatry
[1:59:14] because it's easy to idolize anything.
[1:59:19] That's the reason why don't just take
[1:59:22] I'm in the message.
[1:59:25] You could idolize this message and and
[1:59:28] be far from God.
[1:59:30] You could idolize brother Brandham and
[1:59:32] you still don't have the true baptism of
[1:59:35] the Holy Ghost. You are just under a
[1:59:37] religion.
[1:59:40] That's the reason why we must meet the
[1:59:42] person of Christ.
[1:59:44] You must be a show of your new birth.
[1:59:48] You must be assure of what God is doing
[1:59:50] in your life. Don't be satisfied to say
[1:59:54] I'm in the message. I was baptized in
[1:59:56] Jesus name. The devil knows that better
[1:59:59] than you. He have corrupted men that
[2:00:03] have had experience with God. Paganism
[2:00:06] is very strong. It's very very strong.
[2:00:10] And there's a bunch of it around this
[2:00:11] message.
[2:00:13] A bunch of it around this message. Those
[2:00:19] are the things that are bringing all the
[2:00:21] abuses because that's what it came from.
[2:00:24] Paganism.
[2:00:26] In Paganism, it was it was torture.
[2:00:29] All of Christianity is abuse.
[2:00:35] That's why we must have a personal
[2:00:37] experience with God.
[2:00:40] Our experience must be a living
[2:00:42] experience.
[2:00:44] Now, oh, I believe the message 20 years
[2:00:46] ago. I believe the message five years I
[2:00:48] was baptized. All of those things are
[2:00:50] wonderful.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; But Christ is a living Christ.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today.
[2:01:00] He must be living. Your experience with
[2:01:03] God must be living.
[2:01:06] Oh, now when I was in Liberia, when I
[2:01:08] was in Jerusalem, when I was in this
[2:01:10] place, uh, oh, I used to do this. It
[2:01:13] must be a present tense
[2:01:15] because it's very easy for people to go
[2:01:18] into idolatry. When Luther came, he was
[2:01:22] the move of God, but the Lutherans took
[2:01:25] his that move of God, they took it into
[2:01:27] idolatry
[2:01:29] and they go right back to Catholism.
[2:01:33] The same thing with John Wesley. The
[2:01:35] same thing with the Pentecostals.
[2:01:38] I'm not afraid to say the same thing
[2:01:40] around this message. I'm not afraid to
[2:01:42] say it because I've seen it.
[2:01:47] We idolize everything.
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:53] It's in the fabric of religion. Idolatry
[2:01:56] is in the fabric of religion. That's
[2:01:59] where God took our father Abraham from.
[2:02:05] [Music]
[2:02:08] Let's bow our hands together tonight.
[2:02:13] Lord, I want to
[2:02:16] love you more
[2:02:20] than I ever have before.
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:28] You so easy to adore.
[2:02:36] Lord, I want to love you more.
[2:02:43] Oh Lord, I want to love you more.
[2:02:48] I really want to love you, Father, with
[2:02:51] all of my heart,
[2:02:54] with all of my soul,
[2:02:56] with all of my mind, Lord.
[2:03:00] Father, I just don't want to be
[2:03:01] satisfied with a church.
[2:03:04] I just don't want to be satisfied, Lord.
[2:03:08] I just don't want to come just beyond
[2:03:10] the a covering. I'm in the message and I
[2:03:13] really don't have an experience with
[2:03:15] you.
[2:03:17] I want to love you more.
[2:03:21] I want to know you in the power of your
[2:03:24] resurrection. That power that can
[2:03:26] change, that power that can break
[2:03:29] habits, that power that can deliver.
[2:03:37] Father, we thank you for your word
[2:03:38] tonight. What a word, Lord. What a word
[2:03:42] on Wednesday night, Father God.
[2:03:45] Lord Jesus, I was sitting there and I
[2:03:47] was just thinking in my mind,
[2:03:50] what a spiritual warfare, oh God, that
[2:03:53] we have been honored. If the people only
[2:03:56] have an idea, even this city Minneapolis
[2:04:00] that you are in, the idolatry that is
[2:04:03] done in this city, this is a big uh gale
[2:04:06] city uh trans uh the whole uh trans
[2:04:10] thing, they have a big headquarter here.
[2:04:13] The spirit that waring in this city,
[2:04:18] don't play with your prayer life.
[2:04:21] Don't don't we must not just chase after
[2:04:24] the wind.
[2:04:26] Let's get some substance.
[2:04:30] Let's get some substance that when
[2:04:33] everything fail,
[2:04:36] the only thing that will not fail.
[2:04:41] [Music]
[2:04:45] Father, we thank you for your word
[2:04:46] tonight, Lord. It's an eye opener, Lord
[2:04:50] God. It's you send that word to to
[2:04:52] awaken us, Lord Jesus. Oh God, I just
[2:04:56] love it when you do things like that,
[2:04:58] Father. When you come back, Lord, and
[2:05:01] try to wake us out of our slumbering,
[2:05:03] Lord God, Father, Lord, oh precious Lord
[2:05:07] Jesus, I pray tonight, oh God, that
[2:05:10] Father, oh God, you would just you would
[2:05:12] just deal with every one of us. We, this
[2:05:14] message will go home with us tonight. it
[2:05:17] will go home with us tonight. Father
[2:05:19] Lord God, when we get down to the to the
[2:05:22] pillows on our bed,
[2:05:25] bring something back to our mind.
[2:05:27] Something Lord God, Father, Lord, that
[2:05:30] will encourage us. Something that will
[2:05:32] challenge us, Lord. Something that will
[2:05:34] put us on our need and say, "Lord, I
[2:05:36] want to love you more. I want a reality
[2:05:40] of you, oh God. I just don't want to be,
[2:05:43] Father God. just just I I I I don't want
[2:05:46] to just be satisfied to say I'm I'm in
[2:05:48] the message. I believe Brother Brandham
[2:05:49] as a prophet, but I want that pillow of
[2:05:52] fire in my heart. I want a living Christ
[2:05:55] in my heart.
[2:06:00] Dear father, we pray to God that you
[2:06:03] take us home, Lord Jesus. And once
[2:06:05] again, Father, Lord, bless your people.
[2:06:07] They have to go to work tomorrow, Lord.
[2:06:10] Some of our students back to school. We
[2:06:12] just ask for special grace and blessing
[2:06:14] upon their lives. Father God, we pray
[2:06:17] Lord until we meet here Sunday morning.
[2:06:20] Come Lord God and and be with each and
[2:06:22] every one of us. So Father keep us Lord
[2:06:25] God in everything that we about to do.
[2:06:28] Oh we just love you tonight father. May
[2:06:31] the Holy Ghost just uh have his way
[2:06:33] tonight. We thank you. We appreciate
[2:06:35] you. In Jesus precious name we pray.
[2:06:39] Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. You can
[2:06:42] stand on your feet tonight. I am
[2:06:44] covered. I'm walking by faith. Let's
[2:06:47] sing that and be dismissed. You have a
[2:06:50] safe travel home. Have a good night's
[2:06:51] sleep and have a blessed rest of your
[2:06:54] week.
[2:07:01] Oh, I am covered. I'm covered. I'm
[2:07:05] covered by his blood.
[2:07:08] Jesus has rescued me. Oh yes, I am
[2:07:14] covered.
[2:07:16] Cover covered by his blood.
[2:07:21] Walking by faith. Oh, I'm living.
[2:07:25] Oh yes, I am covered.
[2:07:28] Cover covered by his blood.
[2:07:33] Jesus has rescued me.
[2:07:37] Oh, I am covered,
[2:07:40] covered, covered by his blood. I am
[2:07:45] walking by faith. Oh, living in love.
[2:07:50] Oh, I am covered,
[2:07:52] covered, covered by his blood.
[2:07:57] Jesus has rescued me.
[2:08:02] I am covered, covered, covered by his
[2:08:07] blood. I'm walking by faith and I'm
[2:08:12] living in love. Oh, I am covered,
[2:08:16] covered, covered by his blood.
[2:08:21] Jesus has resueed me.
[2:08:26] Oh, I will glorify
[2:08:29] the name of the Lord. I will glorify
[2:08:35] his name.
[2:08:38] The resurrection power is moving in this
[2:08:43] hour that Jesus might be glorified.
[2:08:49] I am covered, covered, covered by his
[2:08:55] blood.
[2:08:56] Walking by faith and I'm living his law.
[2:09:01] I am covered. Co covered covered by his
[2:09:07] blood.
[2:09:08] Jesus
[2:09:10] has rescued
[2:09:12] me.
[2:09:14] Let's go in the peace of the Lord. The
[2:09:16] Lord bless you tonight.
[2:09:18] All cover.
[2:09:27] Holy living.
[2:09:30] I am covered.
[2:09:32] covered
[2:09:33] covered by his blood and Jesus.
