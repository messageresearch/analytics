[53:22] is in god's promise
[53:25] for this hour
[53:27] praise the lord
[53:28] our consolation is in god's promise for
[53:31] this hour
[53:33] praise the lord amen
[53:35] amen

[53:38] hebrew there is a rest
[53:41] that is promised to the people of god
[53:44] amen
[53:48] and just like
[53:52] just like sarah
[53:54] sarah had to laugh in her in her life
[53:58] she lied the first time when the angels
[54:00] said i call into the time of life
[54:03] sarah will concede she laughed
[54:06] praise the lord
[54:08] amen
[54:09] but we know that the first life was more
[54:12] of a doubt in life
[54:15] a life of being skeptical me being an
[54:18] old woman where i have a child
[54:21] praise the lord
[54:23] amen
[54:24] but then she had a second left
[54:27] and when she left god life and everybody
[54:29] around her life
[54:34] praise the lord
[54:36] when she had a second left
[54:39] the heavens laughed
[54:41] and everybody that was around her have
[54:43] you ever experienced that somebody's
[54:45] laughing you don't know what they're
[54:46] laughing about and
[54:51] praise the lord
[54:53] everybody in the house laughing and then
[54:54] the neighbors year it in oh my goodness
[55:02] praise the lord
[55:06] that was sarah's second life
[55:10] and i believe there is a laughter that
[55:12] is awaiting us

[57:37] to you this morning
[57:39] is is in the comfort
[57:41] to see at the first coming
[57:45] of the lord
[57:47] praise the lord
[57:48] at the first coming
[57:50] of the lord jesus
[57:53] there were just
[57:55] few
[57:56] people
[57:59] now i'm talking about believers now
[58:02] praise the lord i'm talking about
[58:04] believers you can count the wise men and
[58:07] then there are other people that were
[58:09] also involved there were other people
[58:10] that god dealt with during that time but
[58:13] when it comes to the believers the ones
[58:16] that were believing the ones that were
[58:18] you know worshipping god the god of
[58:20] abraham and isaac the one that were
[58:22] following the commandments of the torah
[58:25] there were just few just very few
[58:29] that god dealt with
[58:35] in the first coming of the lord
[58:38] and it's not going to be anything
[58:39] different
[58:42] in this coming of the lord
[58:45] praise the lord
[58:47] amen
[58:50] see what a little better church
[58:55] there was
[58:57] it was zacharias
[58:59] elizabeth
[59:01] mary
[59:04] and joseph
[59:08] anna
[59:11] simeon
[59:14] praise the
[59:16] lord it was just those six
[59:21] the shepherds on the hill
[59:25] praise the lord
[59:29] and even the baby john in his mother's
[59:32] womb
[59:34] praise the lord i have a place for every
[59:36] one of them this morning
[59:38] and we'll just we trust that the lord
[59:40] will be able to
[59:42] to uh
[59:43] to bless us
[59:45] a little better church
[59:49] there was
[59:50] zechariah's married
[59:53] anna simeon six out of a million
[59:58] like the days of noah
[1:00:04] praise the lord
[1:00:06] six of them
[1:00:08] god dead with every one of
[1:00:12] them every one of them every one of
[1:00:16] those six individuals
[1:00:19] with the shepherds on the hill the
[1:00:21] shepherds uh are seven
[1:00:24] but uh uh uh i'll come back to them
[1:00:33] all of those
[1:00:34] six individuals
[1:00:38] god dared with them
[1:00:43] individually
[1:00:46] praise the lord
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:50] and yeah you remember
[1:00:53] the the testimony about uh
[1:00:58] the
[1:00:59] danger in the neighborhood
[1:01:02] praise the lord after the revival
[1:01:04] meeting when brother brandon prayed for
[1:01:06] that woman with the water and and prayed
[1:01:08] for the other lady and uh uh and they
[1:01:11] went home that morning and uh and just
[1:01:14] in the same time that other lady you
[1:01:16] know received her healing you know
[1:01:18] shouting on on the hill then and this
[1:01:20] other woman also received and and you
[1:01:22] know uh uh all of these things they are
[1:01:26] not just story to make you to believe uh
[1:01:29] uh brother branham no it's not about
[1:01:31] believing brother branham is believing
[1:01:32] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:01:34] to them forever because you were
[1:01:36] realized here
[1:01:38] that
[1:01:39] during the the the the coming of the law
[1:01:42] the first coming of the law the angel
[1:01:45] gabriel was visiting that neighborhood
[1:01:48] the same angel that spoke
[1:01:50] to zacharias
[1:01:53] yes
[1:01:54] was the same angel that spoke to mary
[1:01:58] it was the same angel that spoke to
[1:02:01] joseph
[1:02:02] by night
[1:02:04] yes
[1:02:04] praise the lord amen
[1:02:07] so angers visit the neighborhood
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:12] when they come down in an area and and
[1:02:15] and and brings a blessing there i mean
[1:02:17] the the the move to all the hearts that
[1:02:20] is that is that is desiring an
[1:02:22] experience from god
[1:02:24] praise the lord
[1:02:26] amen
[1:02:28] so there were there were only six or we
[1:02:30] would say seven you know uh uh but it
[1:02:33] was it was just a little group it was a
[1:02:36] new group of people that that experience
[1:02:41] they had an experience they had they had
[1:02:44] a consolation there was something that
[1:02:47] happened to them comforting
[1:02:50] for them to be able to de-wave the hour
[1:02:53] that they were living in
[1:02:55] praise the lord
[1:02:57] amen
[1:02:58] now so you see that this first coming of
[1:03:02] the lord
[1:03:04] it was a coming just like the church is
[1:03:07] awaiting the coming of the lord
[1:03:09] and and but the thing about it that this
[1:03:12] church as we think about the coming of
[1:03:14] the lord is more in a sense we think
[1:03:18] about our going away
[1:03:24] praise the lord amen we think about our
[1:03:27] goal in a way and that is the thing
[1:03:31] that
[1:03:34] has put the church in the kind of a
[1:03:37] scoffing condition
[1:03:40] praise the lord
[1:03:42] it has put the church in a kind of a
[1:03:44] scoffing condition because by scripture
[1:03:47] we know the coming of the lord the the
[1:03:50] the the the completeness of the coming
[1:03:52] of the law will be our goal in the way
[1:03:55] but our going away is not the coming of
[1:03:57] the law
[1:03:58] there is a coming
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:04] the bible says in a moment movement is a
[1:04:07] time period
[1:04:13] the lord himself shall descend with a
[1:04:15] shout the voice of the archangel and the
[1:04:18] trump of god
[1:04:20] so it's all the process of his coming
[1:04:27] are we together
[1:04:29] amen
[1:04:31] now so just like in his first coming
[1:04:35] all of these people experienced the
[1:04:37] coming of the lord
[1:04:41] to prepare them
[1:04:43] for the hour of his first coming
[1:04:46] they all experienced the coming of the
[1:04:49] lord even john the baptist experienced
[1:04:52] it in his mother's womb
[1:04:55] so it makes provision
[1:04:57] for the little ones
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:02] it makes provision structural provision
[1:05:04] for the little ones
[1:05:09] that's why we must keep them in that
[1:05:10] atmosphere
[1:05:14] praise the lord
[1:05:16] because if john in his mother warm
[1:05:20] experienced the coming of the lord just
[1:05:22] by the mention of jesus christ i believe
[1:05:25] that just by the mention of his name
[1:05:28] elizabeth said just by the mention
[1:05:34] the baby leave for joy
[1:05:37] praise the lord if the baby in the
[1:05:40] mother womb will leave for joy by the
[1:05:42] mention of his name was about our little
[1:05:44] ones
[1:05:51] glory be to god
[1:05:55] amen
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:00] praise the lord
[1:06:04] it's like i kind of forget something
[1:06:06] here
[1:06:07] and now my
[1:06:09] my notes have turned into chinese
[1:06:11] writing
[1:06:16] praise the lord i have a handwriting on
[1:06:19] the wall
[1:06:20] and we need a daniel to interpret it
[1:06:24] praise the lord
[1:06:26] glory be to god
[1:06:30] amen are we together
[1:06:34] now so yeah
[1:06:36] and and and the beautiful thing there
[1:06:38] also look at it now look at this rapture
[1:06:41] setting let me let me say it to you like
[1:06:43] this because our consolation our uh
[1:06:47] coming of the law that we are waiting
[1:06:48] for is the rapture but look at this
[1:06:50] rapture setting how beautiful it is
[1:06:55] god visited
[1:06:57] zacharias
[1:06:59] god visited a family
[1:07:02] a man and his wife
[1:07:05] praise the lord
[1:07:06] amen
[1:07:08] now
[1:07:09] they they
[1:07:10] i mean they marry us as as young
[1:07:13] sweetheart live all their lives together
[1:07:15] never had a time
[1:07:18] but that was not a requirement for god's
[1:07:21] visitation
[1:07:24] praise the lord
[1:07:26] people called elizabeth byron but god
[1:07:29] still visited her
[1:07:32] praise the lord
[1:07:34] and she experienced the visitation of
[1:07:36] god in one of the most glorious hour
[1:07:41] what does that reveal that there will
[1:07:42] even be couples that will be going
[1:07:45] through difficult time in their life but
[1:07:47] they will be steadfast in faith and in
[1:07:50] this rapture in our god will visit him
[1:07:55] praise the lord
[1:07:56] whether visiting them with child or
[1:07:58] whatever visiting them by the divine
[1:08:00] healing and what the the the concept
[1:08:03] here is that our physical body condition
[1:08:06] does not stop god from visiting us when
[1:08:09] our faith is right when our heart is
[1:08:12] right
[1:08:15] amen praise the lord
[1:08:18] the bible says hannah was a blind woman
[1:08:21] but yes she could see more than the high
[1:08:23] priest
[1:08:24] praise the lord because she saw the
[1:08:26] coming of the lord she was a blind woman
[1:08:28] she did not have a physical eye but yes
[1:08:31] she could see
[1:08:34] and all the ones that were using specks
[1:08:44] so it shows that in this coming of the
[1:08:46] law that we are in
[1:08:49] some of god's children will be having
[1:08:51] health problems
[1:08:54] but it does not handle your faith
[1:08:59] praise the lord don't let the devil use
[1:09:01] your health situation to handle your
[1:09:03] faith
[1:09:07] glory be to god
[1:09:10] oh i love this one
[1:09:12] mary and joseph
[1:09:14] they were planning their wedding
[1:09:16] they were now married they were not
[1:09:18] couples
[1:09:19] so god is showing a rapturing condition
[1:09:22] that right in that time of the rapture
[1:09:24] people will be planning waiting they
[1:09:26] will be dating there will be you know
[1:09:28] everything
[1:09:29] you'll be in cold shape
[1:09:31] and all of that
[1:09:35] but you see
[1:09:37] it also shows that
[1:09:40] no matter what you foresee we know
[1:09:42] america was just a young virgin girl
[1:09:47] she had the same
[1:09:49] young
[1:09:50] emotion that all of you young girls have
[1:09:55] yes
[1:09:56] praise the lord
[1:09:58] she was thinking about who am i mean she
[1:10:01] was thinking about when will my wedding
[1:10:03] be she was thinking about all of that
[1:10:06] but her heart was right
[1:10:09] if her heart was not in the right place
[1:10:11] the angel would not visit her the angel
[1:10:14] never came because she wanted to get
[1:10:16] married the angel came because the word
[1:10:18] says a virgin shall conceive
[1:10:22] that's right amen
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:26] yes
[1:10:28] praise the lord oh joseph was under he
[1:10:31] was on the other man he lost his wife
[1:10:34] yes
[1:10:35] he had to raise his children by himself
[1:10:38] and he was thinking about you know
[1:10:40] having another wife again but the bible
[1:10:42] said he was a just man
[1:10:46] he was a just man
[1:10:49] oh glory be to god
[1:10:52] glory be to god
[1:10:53] right in the time of this coming of the
[1:10:55] lord there will still be just men
[1:10:58] there will still be men who hearts are
[1:11:00] right
[1:11:03] men who are still standing for the truth
[1:11:06] standing for righteousness standing for
[1:11:08] clean living
[1:11:11] hallelujah
[1:11:12] yes there will still be men that will
[1:11:14] still be women
[1:11:16] that will stand for the value of the
[1:11:17] world
[1:11:20] praise the lord
[1:11:22] amen

[1:11:26] their own facebook in the other day
[1:11:32] your own has just modified itself that
[1:11:34] you can put it in your pocket
[1:11:38] now all that all yours have done it has
[1:11:40] just become a smart demon
[1:11:44] that you can put in your pocket
[1:11:50] praise the lord
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:53] but as the son of god as a daughter of
[1:11:55] god we've been given power to control
[1:11:57] every demon
[1:11:59] so whether i put it in my pocket is
[1:12:00] under control
[1:12:02] i must keep it under control
[1:12:04] i must not allow that demon to control
[1:12:06] my mind and abuse my mind and my spirit
[1:12:09] i must keep it under control
[1:12:12] because i'm a son of god
[1:12:19] praise the lord
[1:12:21] oh i love it when the wonder when the
[1:12:23] when the scripture becomes so beautiful
[1:12:24] like this
[1:12:26] she was a young teenage girl
[1:12:28] thinking about life
[1:12:31] praise the lord
[1:12:33] amen
[1:12:34] well her heart was right
[1:12:40] solomon said your heart is the issue of
[1:12:42] life
[1:12:45] don't defy it
[1:12:47] don't corrupt your heart
[1:12:57] joseph was going through his own problem
[1:12:59] but he was a just man
[1:13:03] and he was glad to find mary
[1:13:06] a young woman still glad to find a
[1:13:08] virgin in nazareth because nazareth was
[1:13:11] one of the most fatigued city
[1:13:18] but he was glad to find the virgin
[1:13:21] in the coming of the lord
[1:13:25] in the coming of the lord he was glad to
[1:13:28] find the virgin
[1:13:32] are we together amen
[1:13:38] and it went about planning everything
[1:13:40] you know and and
[1:13:44] talking on the phone well you say they
[1:13:46] didn't have phone those days
[1:13:48] but they had a way they were sending
[1:13:49] messages across
[1:13:52] praise the lord
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:54] joseph high is capital shop
[1:13:56] neighbor will always want to go in the
[1:13:58] market
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:02] she will always want to go in the market
[1:14:04] because she knew she would have to stop
[1:14:06] by and talk a little bit
[1:14:08] praise the lord
[1:14:11] when he said coke she said i'm not
[1:14:13] feeling too well i can go shopping
[1:14:24] but it was in the coming of the lord and
[1:14:26] here we have
[1:14:27] blonde hannah separated from her husband
[1:14:33] praise the lord her husband died
[1:14:36] when she was just a young young girl
[1:14:39] and she just dedicated the rest of her
[1:14:42] life to serve the lord
[1:14:44] and faithfulness
[1:14:46] you would think you would think you
[1:14:48] would think that this woman
[1:14:51] dedicated her life
[1:14:53] says i mean i mean god should just bless
[1:14:56] her i mean i mean
[1:14:58] is it a difficult thing for god to just
[1:15:00] bless her with good health let her just
[1:15:02] enjoy her days
[1:15:04] but yes she became blind
[1:15:08] praise the lord
[1:15:10] but you see her blindness did not affect
[1:15:12] her faith
[1:15:16] it did not affect her faith and make her
[1:15:19] more stronger
[1:15:21] waiting for the consolation of israel
[1:15:25] and because she was blind god was
[1:15:27] dealing with her envisions
[1:15:33] praise the lord
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:36] that's the reason why we don't have
[1:15:38] visions among the people because they
[1:15:40] are not blind to this world
[1:15:44] praise the lord they are not blind to
[1:15:46] this world we see so much things that
[1:15:48] pollute our mind
[1:15:50] that is hard for the holy ghost to get
[1:15:52] your your subconscious in the place to
[1:15:55] line up with divine
[1:16:04] gift because she was blind so
[1:16:07] she was living by visions
[1:16:11] and god was not only giving her vision
[1:16:13] for herself she was having vision for
[1:16:15] everybody

[1:16:41] but brandon says whatever you give to
[1:16:43] the lord he will use it
[1:16:51] and you're seeming the bible talks about

[1:16:58] being an elderly man
[1:17:00] a devote man a just and devote man a man
[1:17:05] of devotion
[1:17:07] why because
[1:17:09] he got a revelation
[1:17:12] he
[1:17:13] got a revelation this thing was so
[1:17:16] revered to him by the holy ghost that's
[1:17:19] what the scripture says by the holy
[1:17:22] ghost
[1:17:23] pentecost has not come
[1:17:25] but yet god was dealing with them by the
[1:17:27] holy ghost by his spirit
[1:17:30] amen
[1:17:35] he got a revelation
[1:17:39] not not this scared a
[1:17:42] scare factor that people i shall not die
[1:17:44] i will i will see the glory of the lord
[1:17:46] i shall not die for a bunch of fear
[1:17:49] but this man got a revelation by the
[1:17:51] holy ghost
[1:17:54] that i will see the lord's christ
[1:17:58] you know what does that mean i will see
[1:18:01] the word of god being made flesh
[1:18:05] praise the lord
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:08] i will see the word of god
[1:18:11] be made flesh
[1:18:15] when moses said god will raise up a
[1:18:18] prophet
[1:18:19] he says i shall not die
[1:18:22] i will see that word
[1:18:24] be made flesh
[1:18:27] praise the lord
[1:18:30] that's the thing that is keeping the
[1:18:31] rapture people
[1:18:33] the thing that is keeping the rapture
[1:18:36] is for this bride to see the world being
[1:18:38] made flesh
[1:18:40] and this time it's not going to be in
[1:18:42] another person
[1:18:43] it's going to be in you
[1:18:50] some people think the rapture is the
[1:18:51] escape
[1:18:53] from their temptation you better fight
[1:18:55] that temptation and deal with that devil
[1:18:57] and put that devil on your feet
[1:19:03] the rapture can just come our lusting
[1:19:05] will be over
[1:19:09] thank you jesus
[1:19:11] are we together
[1:19:13] he was a devout man
[1:19:17] a righteous man
[1:19:20] but he got a revelation
[1:19:23] that's why brother brahm says the
[1:19:24] rapture is a revelation
[1:19:27] praise the lord god has to reveal it to
[1:19:29] you
[1:19:32] it's a revelation
[1:19:36] it's not a concept
[1:19:40] you by you just knowing about it it's a
[1:19:42] concept
[1:19:43] the songs of the prophet knew that
[1:19:45] elijah
[1:19:47] was going to be
[1:19:48] taken they knew they told elijah your
[1:19:51] master will be taken but they never had
[1:19:53] the double potion
[1:19:56] yes
[1:19:57] the bible says it was revealed to him by
[1:20:00] the holy ghost
[1:20:03] that he will not see death
[1:20:07] praise the lord
[1:20:09] until he sees the lord christ
[1:20:12] until he sees the world being made flesh
[1:20:19] what a consolation
[1:20:22] what a consolation now you can sit there
[1:20:25] and just think that it was easy for him
[1:20:29] he had this revelation but he had to
[1:20:32] fight
[1:20:33] his faith every day
[1:20:36] he had to fight things around him he had
[1:20:38] to deal with the same devil that you are
[1:20:40] dealing with
[1:20:45] yes praise the lord amen
[1:20:51] he says oh if the law would just give me
[1:20:53] the vision or the law would just reverse
[1:20:55] something to me let me tell you the more
[1:20:57] when god reveals something to you
[1:20:59] whenever god is dealing with you
[1:21:02] your life becomes difficult
[1:21:07] amen whenever god is dealing with you
[1:21:10] your life becomes difficult because all
[1:21:13] hell gets against it
[1:21:19] praise the lord
[1:21:24] and then if you're having a smooth ride
[1:21:26] you better find out who's driving

[1:21:39] you better find out
[1:21:41] who's driving
[1:21:43] praise the lord
[1:21:50] so he had things to deal with
[1:21:53] he was an elderly man he had eggs in his
[1:21:56] body
[1:21:57] and everything
[1:22:02] but he was holding his revelation in his
[1:22:04] heart

[1:27:48] lord let your seven depart in peace are
[1:27:51] calling to your word
[1:27:55] are calling to your word

[1:30:12] what a mighty god we said
[1:30:21] jeremiah chapter 22 let's read verse
[1:30:23] teddy
[1:30:30] let's read verse teddy
[1:30:37] praise the lord amen
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:42] now you will see here that
[1:30:45] uh
[1:30:48] uh let me let me just
[1:30:50] get my
[1:30:51] myself together here before i
[1:30:53] uh
[1:30:55] praise the lord
[1:31:08] praise the lord
[1:31:12] now there's something in the scripture
[1:31:16] that is called the blood curse
[1:31:18] that's what we're about to read
[1:31:21] the blood curse
[1:31:29] so
[1:31:34] what's going on
[1:31:38] okay
[1:31:39] now so uh uh jeremiah chapter 20 uh 22
[1:31:43] 30 yeah thus said the lord right
[1:31:46] yeah
[1:31:47] this man chalice
[1:31:50] amen
[1:31:56] uh you you realize the other
[1:32:00] this uh i mean this was one of the songs
[1:32:03] uh uh down in the lineage
[1:32:06] of uh of the of the tribe of judah
[1:32:09] you know from uh from josiah his father
[1:32:12] was a roger's king this is uh jacqueline
[1:32:16] you know
[1:32:17] uh and and the bible says how evil he
[1:32:20] was in
[1:32:21] in the sight of the lord a very very
[1:32:24] evil
[1:32:25] uh but something is plain out here you
[1:32:28] know i'll go back to his evilness
[1:32:31] but yet god
[1:32:33] now that this is this is where i want to
[1:32:35] grab you now you have to remember that
[1:32:37] god promised david that there will be a
[1:32:40] seed
[1:32:41] because of david's sake
[1:32:44] there will always be a seed in the house
[1:32:47] of judah
[1:32:48] so from david there was supposed to be
[1:32:50] someone on the throne from the house of
[1:32:54] david
[1:32:55] onto the millennium
[1:32:58] are we together
[1:33:00] on to the millennium there was supposed
[1:33:02] to be one but now yeri said here an an
[1:33:06] evil man an evil seed has been
[1:33:09] introduced
[1:33:10] into the lineage
[1:33:12] and because of his weakness
[1:33:15] god is bringing a curse
[1:33:18] that he's now going to be
[1:33:20] chalice so what does that do
[1:33:24] it affect the covenant that god gave to
[1:33:27] david
[1:33:31] are we together
[1:33:33] but the messiah was supposed to come
[1:33:35] through the lanes of david
[1:33:40] are we together
[1:33:42] praise the lord i don't want to lose you
[1:33:43] i know your mind is flying all over the
[1:33:45] place i don't want to lose you now amen
[1:33:48] praise the lord
[1:33:51] i know jesus he's the palette
[1:33:53] of this boat but i'm i'm just there to
[1:33:55] help keep you on the boat amen
[1:33:58] so i don't want to lose you if you fall
[1:34:00] off i might be held responsible
[1:34:03] pilot responsibility responsibility is
[1:34:05] to drive you i have to keep you on the
[1:34:07] boat hey man
[1:34:08] so so pay attention now don't don't
[1:34:10] don't overeat and slumber and fall over
[1:34:13] in the water just pay attention
[1:34:15] praise the
[1:34:16] lord or you just say you know uh
[1:34:19] rejoicing over one uh uh holy ghost
[1:34:22] snack that you have got here press the
[1:34:24] link
[1:34:25] and you go falling over don't don't do
[1:34:26] that
[1:34:27] let's let's stay together
[1:34:33] thus said the lord right here this man
[1:34:35] chalice
[1:34:38] a man there shall not prosper
[1:34:40] in his days
[1:34:42] for no man of his sea shall prosper
[1:34:46] sitting upon the throne of david
[1:34:49] all ruling
[1:34:51] anymore in judah
[1:34:54] so this was a blood curse
[1:34:58] and what this curse is it did is that it
[1:35:01] cut off the messiah
[1:35:05] god has already promised oh glory be to
[1:35:08] god
[1:35:10] oh glory be to god
[1:35:12] amen he has already promised
[1:35:18] that for my seventh david's sake
[1:35:20] it was an everlasting covenant
[1:35:24] but yet
[1:35:26] he has cut off
[1:35:30] he has cut off
[1:35:33] praise the lord
[1:35:35] amen
[1:35:38] that's why we've been studying
[1:35:41] couple of weeks
[1:35:43] now
[1:35:45] about the blessing and the breath right
[1:35:48] the birthright
[1:35:50] could be taken
[1:35:53] you could lose the breath right
[1:35:58] praise the lord
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:02] here god comes because of the weakness
[1:36:12] god cursed this man in his seat
[1:36:16] and said no more received from this
[1:36:18] wicked lineage
[1:36:21] sit on
[1:36:23] the throne
[1:36:24] praise the lord
[1:36:26] now so god has cut himself
[1:36:30] he have got himself in the ticket he has
[1:36:32] to bring himself out yes
[1:36:35] praise the lord he has now to bring
[1:36:39] himself out because this is the one that
[1:36:41] promised the seed of the woman
[1:36:44] shall bruise the head of the serpent
[1:36:47] and that's the one i promised david an
[1:36:49] everlasting throne
[1:36:51] that the son of david will rule over the
[1:36:54] nations
[1:36:55] this one that promised abraham to be the
[1:36:57] father of nations
[1:36:59] and all of these promises was pointing
[1:37:02] to the coming of the messiah
[1:37:04] for yet he has cut it
[1:37:07] so he has cut himself in the ticket
[1:37:10] he has to bring himself out
[1:37:15] god has to now bring himself out
[1:37:19] hallelujah
[1:37:20] [Laughter]
[1:37:21] oh automatic god we said
[1:37:24] praise the lord
[1:37:26] hallelujah
[1:37:28] now you will understand why
[1:37:31] the promise of the virgin birth was
[1:37:34] important
[1:37:36] now you will understand it will make
[1:37:38] more sense to you
[1:37:40] when god
[1:37:42] told ahash i will give you a
[1:37:46] sign a virgin
[1:37:49] shall conceive
[1:37:53] so now god is now going through the
[1:37:56] lineage of the male
[1:37:57] he has now to take another approach
[1:38:02] and bring a virgin
[1:38:08] oh thank you jesus
[1:38:11] oh he's a waymaker
[1:38:13] praise the lord
[1:38:15] he is a way maker
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:38:18] because when god speaks he swear by
[1:38:21] himself
[1:38:22] he is a waymaker
[1:38:30] praise the lord amen
[1:38:32] it will make more sense to you when you
[1:38:35] read the book of luke
[1:38:37] when luke gave his genealogy
[1:38:40] he didn't go like matthew when
[1:38:44] no
[1:38:46] luke went from merit
[1:38:48] because of this curse
[1:38:51] because there is no way the messiah
[1:38:54] would have come through the lineage of
[1:38:56] david when god has cursed this royal sea
[1:38:59] line
[1:39:05] praise the lord
[1:39:08] let's look in the book of luke
[1:39:22] praise the lord
[1:39:24] glory be to god
[1:39:36] thank you jesus praise the lord thank
[1:39:38] you
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:42] luke chapter 3
[1:39:47] luke chapter 3
[1:39:52] verse 23 the bible says
[1:39:54] and jesus himself
[1:39:58] began to be about 30 years of age
[1:40:03] being
[1:40:04] as was supposed
[1:40:06] the son of joseph
[1:40:10] how did he became the son of joseph
[1:40:12] supposedly because of mary
[1:40:17] praise the lord
[1:40:20] so you see that's how joseph with his
[1:40:23] connection to mary
[1:40:27] the messiah is now using joseph linage
[1:40:34] oh my goodness
[1:40:37] praise the lord
[1:40:39] and then over in verse 31 that's when it
[1:40:42] now connects back to david
[1:40:51] now it's bridged back to david
[1:40:54] and going back to abraham and going back
[1:40:56] to adam
[1:40:58] and adam back to god
[1:41:06] praise the lord
[1:41:09] now you will see why the virgin birth
[1:41:11] was so important
[1:41:17] while the virgin bird was so important
[1:41:26] because it was a breach
[1:41:29] the virgin birth was so important
[1:41:31] because it ties everything back to
[1:41:33] genesis
[1:41:36] the virgin birth brings the value of the
[1:41:40] three sacrifices that god gave to a
[1:41:43] woman
[1:41:46] the virgin birth brings value to that
[1:41:53] that's the reason why young women don't
[1:41:55] mess yourself up
[1:41:57] don't allow facebook
[1:41:59] and the evil of this age
[1:42:01] to destroy those sacrifices that god
[1:42:04] gave to you
[1:42:08] the virgin birth
[1:42:10] was not to put a statue
[1:42:12] in catholic church
[1:42:15] the virgin birth was not because of a
[1:42:17] woman that the roman catholic want to
[1:42:19] live up over the world
[1:42:21] the virgin birth was important
[1:42:25] to bring value
[1:42:26] to the three sacrificial that god gave
[1:42:29] to a woman
[1:42:34] her virgin saint
[1:42:37] her womanhood
[1:42:39] and her motherhood
[1:42:45] are you hearing me this morning
[1:42:50] i don't know if you swallow your amen
[1:42:52] but i hope you hear me
[1:43:06] i mean i could take you down that robber
[1:43:08] i'm not talking about the curse this
[1:43:10] morning
[1:43:11] i just i just want to i just wanted to
[1:43:14] to use this
[1:43:15] for us to see
[1:43:17] the importance of the virgin birth
[1:43:19] why god in that evil city
[1:43:23] and that evil time that they were living
[1:43:25] in
[1:43:27] without a prophet
[1:43:29] the sadducees and the pharisees they
[1:43:32] they have raising on the scene and all
[1:43:34] they are doing is just reasoning
[1:43:36] they are just reasoning with the
[1:43:38] holiness of god
[1:43:40] trying to make their movement popular
[1:43:45] but the effect of god
[1:43:47] has gone from the people
[1:43:52] no effect of the word
[1:43:57] church has just become form
[1:44:00] formality
[1:44:12] praise the lord
[1:44:17] and the angel
[1:44:18] gabriel visited this man john
[1:44:25] he never allowed his age
[1:44:28] to reduce
[1:44:31] his service
[1:44:34] the bible says he was a just man he was
[1:44:36] a devote man he went to the temple and
[1:44:39] and he burned incense and what burning
[1:44:41] incense represent to the church of this
[1:44:44] last day he was a prayer warrior
[1:44:46] he gets to the to the building before
[1:44:48] the people comes he said lord bless the
[1:44:50] worshippers as they are coming father
[1:44:52] bless the musician lord bless the
[1:44:54] preacher he just blew incense in a place
[1:44:57] and everybody knew john for that
[1:44:59] that he was a prayer warrior
[1:45:02] praise the lord
[1:45:04] amen
[1:45:06] do you see that just like we selling
[1:45:08] malachi on on on
[1:45:10] on wednesday night
[1:45:12] a man dedicating his life
[1:45:16] to that cost
[1:45:18] but yet
[1:45:19] he has gone chalice
[1:45:24] those are the kind of things that will
[1:45:25] make laodicea's christians
[1:45:32] their past will be their heroes oh i
[1:45:34] used to pray uh you know
[1:45:37] i used to be a prayer warrior
[1:45:39] you get a bunch of people that have
[1:45:40] their past as their hero
[1:45:43] they don't have no present-day hero
[1:45:44] because they are failure and
[1:45:46] backsplatters
[1:45:47] they are only dwelling on the path those
[1:45:49] days those days those days are dead
[1:46:02] lord be to god
[1:46:08] how can you put that into context that's
[1:46:10] the reason why the people in malacca the
[1:46:12] struggle with his message about the love
[1:46:15] of god
[1:46:17] how can you call this the love of god
[1:46:24] we are just coming out as cartes the god
[1:46:28] of heaven
[1:46:31] how can you call this
[1:46:34] are we together
[1:46:39] but you see when a man
[1:46:41] has hate himself in god
[1:46:44] when he has hated himself in god
[1:46:47] not because he's scared
[1:46:49] he had himself in god because he loved
[1:46:52] god
[1:46:55] praise the lord god when he have hate
[1:46:58] himself in god
[1:47:02] yes
[1:47:05] nothing of this word praise the lord
[1:47:09] yes whether he have a vehicle or you
[1:47:11] have it does not bother him
[1:47:13] he's hate in god by love
[1:47:17] lord jesus
[1:47:20] praise the lord amen so you can just see
[1:47:24] in that coming of the lord look at the
[1:47:26] people that god was dealing with every
[1:47:29] one of them have problems
[1:47:33] every one of them zechariah elizabeth
[1:47:35] chalice
[1:47:39] they have gossip about her until they
[1:47:41] don't even know what to say
[1:47:43] every child in the time knew about
[1:47:45] elizabeth not having a
[1:47:48] child but it did not change
[1:47:52] their service to god
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:48:00] hannah was a blind woman
[1:48:02] she could have just call it cut it off
[1:48:04] i'm blind i can't see i don't need to
[1:48:05] read bible
[1:48:12] but it did not change
[1:48:19] let's marry that a young young virgin
[1:48:21] girl
[1:48:22] planning for her future
[1:48:25] living right kept herself living right
[1:48:27] doing everything that is right
[1:48:30] but she will soon become the scandal of
[1:48:32] the town
[1:48:35] because god has found favor with her
[1:48:40] brother branham said when god found
[1:48:41] favor with you he will allow the whole
[1:48:43] church to talk about you
[1:48:46] [Applause]
[1:48:53] you that love praises from people
[1:49:02] what a consolation
[1:49:05] what a consolation you realize that
[1:49:08] their consolation was not in ethnic
[1:49:11] things
[1:49:13] consolation was not in being popular
[1:49:16] or in the in the most popular movement i
[1:49:19] mean the message i mean the message
[1:49:23] if that is your cancellation you're
[1:49:24] deceiving yourself
[1:49:26] because you know in your heart
[1:49:28] if you're not living right that's right
[1:49:36] their consolation
[1:49:39] was in the way that god was dealing with
[1:49:41] them desperate of their situation
[1:49:45] that's part of their trial that's part
[1:49:46] of their difficulties
[1:49:48] every time they hear the word of god god
[1:49:50] speaks to them oh thank you jesus thank
[1:49:52] you jesus lord you still love me thank
[1:49:55] you jesus
[1:50:00] the thing that order would despise will
[1:50:02] be the little thing that will make them
[1:50:04] to weep
[1:50:06] so god thank you thank you for your love
[1:50:09] what a consolation to live in this hour
[1:50:15] where prosperity and willingness
[1:50:18] is all on the people's mind
[1:50:20] competition
[1:50:25] no time for god
[1:50:29] not only no time for church but no time
[1:50:31] for god
[1:50:40] praise the lord
[1:50:44] at that word
[1:50:45] a person who lived their life for
[1:50:48] themself
[1:50:49] lived a selfish life
[1:50:55] praise the lord
[1:51:04] a person will live their life for
[1:51:06] themselves live a selfish life
[1:51:08] we must live for others
[1:51:11] the scripture says there you want
[1:51:12] another burden
[1:51:14] so fulfill the lord of christ
[1:51:17] and we got to have feelings
[1:51:21] for one another
[1:51:24] and therefore
[1:51:25] when you do all you know how to do
[1:51:31] then when you do later at night
[1:51:36] well you have the consolation knowing
[1:51:40] that you have done your best
[1:51:44] knowing that you have done your best
[1:51:47] you don't allow yourself to be judged by
[1:51:49] what people think about you
[1:51:52] i don't care what you think about me
[1:51:55] you don't know my life
[1:52:09] a person who lived their life for
[1:52:11] themselves live a selfish life
[1:52:17] you can never find consolation in that
[1:52:20] you're not finding consolation in the
[1:52:22] life that you're living you're finding
[1:52:24] cancellation in the things you have
[1:52:27] i have this i have that i have this but
[1:52:30] inside there is no consolation
[1:52:32] because you stay one more amen
[1:52:38] this age is an age
[1:52:39] a spiritual age of hollows
[1:52:42] can never be satisfied
[1:52:46] people find counsel in things that they
[1:52:48] have they can number them i have this
[1:52:51] one they have that one i have that one

[1:56:52] is that this picture
[1:56:55] is not about brother brennan
[1:57:00] this picture is more authentic than this
[1:57:03] picture
[1:57:05] this is just a painting
[1:57:08] this picture is god and layering signs
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:14] god allowing signs
[1:57:17] since you will believe signs more than
[1:57:19] god god allow your signs to be able to
[1:57:23] pick up
[1:57:24] the pillow of fire
[1:57:28] [Applause]
[1:57:43] we make it about brother brandon that's
[1:57:45] why people are afraid of it it's not
[1:57:47] about brother branham
[1:57:49] brother branham said i was just dead it
[1:57:52] just happened that i was there
[1:57:58] it's more about the pillow of fire the
[1:58:00] same pillar of fire that met paul on the
[1:58:03] road of damascus the same pillar of fire
[1:58:06] that led the children of israel that
[1:58:09] pillar of fire has dedicated itself in
[1:58:12] our day
[1:58:17] [Applause]
[1:58:28] god
[1:58:30] bringing a consolation to his church
[1:58:33] when he said i will never leave you and
[1:58:35] never forsake you
[1:58:37] wherever god's people are
[1:58:40] this light is always there
[1:58:49] praise the lord
[1:58:50] it's not when you put it there that it's
[1:58:52] there
[1:58:54] it's not when you put it there that is
[1:58:56] there god has already put it in god has
[1:58:59] already dedicated this message of the
[1:59:02] hour god has dedicated his prophet
[1:59:06] nothing you can do about it
[1:59:08] you can have your opinion
[1:59:11] [Music]
[1:59:28] what a day what an age that we are
[1:59:30] living in
[1:59:32] praise the lord
[1:59:34] amen
[1:59:42] the seed of god
[1:59:45] eternal life comes from the greek war
[1:59:47] zoe
[1:59:49] so it is
[1:59:51] that life soul is a life of god and if
[1:59:54] the life of god
[1:59:56] living in you it will produce a godly
[1:59:59] life
[2:00:01] just as setting
[2:00:03] as i'm standing here on this platform
[2:00:08] and the man
[2:00:09] that got it
[2:00:11] can no more perish
[2:00:14] then god can perish
[2:00:18] because god
[2:00:20] is in that man
[2:00:23] i don't know when we say greta is he
[2:00:25] that is in me
[2:00:26] than in the word
[2:00:28] sometimes it's just a concept
[2:00:32] praise the lord
[2:00:33] if you are saying that because you want
[2:00:35] to break you are standing on the wrong
[2:00:37] foot
[2:00:48] oh praise the lord
[2:00:50] glory be to god
[2:00:52] the man that got it can a normal perish
[2:00:56] because god is in that man he that
[2:00:58] hearing my word and believe on him that
[2:01:01] sent me has everlasting life and shall
[2:01:04] not come into condemnation
[2:01:09] praise the lord
[2:01:15] he that i eat my flesh and drink my
[2:01:17] blood
[2:01:19] i will rise him up in the last day
[2:01:22] that's his word
[2:01:24] what a consolation
[2:01:26] yes to the believer yes it is what a
[2:01:29] consolation
[2:01:31] amen what a consolation to the believer
[2:01:37] by the way we have in communion on the
[2:01:39] first sunday in october
[2:01:42] what a consolation
[2:01:45] to know
[2:01:47] that when we come around the communion
[2:01:48] table is not a ritual
[2:01:52] it's not a ritual
[2:01:55] it's an ordinance
[2:01:59] it's an ordinance
[2:02:02] we have consolation
[2:02:05] that we are doing what jesus told us to
[2:02:07] do
[2:02:09] that's our consolation
[2:02:11] he that eat my flesh and drink my blood
[2:02:15] praise the lord
[2:02:17] amen but you see what what has gone
[2:02:19] wrong with the church is that they have
[2:02:22] placed that ordinance above the word of
[2:02:25] god
[2:02:26] no that ordinary is in honor of the word
[2:02:30] of god
[2:02:32] is in honor of the word of god it's not
[2:02:35] about the word of god it's not more holy
[2:02:37] than this word is holy
[2:02:47] we find a consolation because we have
[2:02:50] been identified with that body
[2:02:52] by death burial and resurrection
[2:02:55] by the way of baptism so we find a
[2:02:58] consolation
[2:03:00] we find a consolation
[2:03:04] how can a believer
[2:03:05] that is identified with his body
[2:03:08] don't find consolation in the communion
[2:03:13] how
[2:03:14] what are you afraid of
[2:03:16] what are you scared of
[2:03:19] they wish me they buried you alive you
[2:03:21] was not dead
[2:03:24] they bury you alive
[2:03:30] but if you were dead
[2:03:32] you will find consolation
[2:03:42] be to god
[2:03:46] are we together
[2:03:51] the consolation of israel
[2:03:55] god dealing with those people see see
[2:03:57] that take care of that that joseph found
[2:03:59] himself
[2:04:01] after he have he have trusted the lord
[2:04:03] he raised his children now he thought he
[2:04:05] had found a wife
[2:04:08] he knew this girl he he observed her he
[2:04:10] knows that she loved the lord
[2:04:13] and now she's coming
[2:04:15] with this message i've seen an angel
[2:04:18] joseph is scared to death
[2:04:21] he don't want to blaspheme
[2:04:25] but yet
[2:04:27] he had never heard any young person
[2:04:29] saying they have seen an angel not even
[2:04:32] the priests
[2:04:33] in the temple talking about angel
[2:04:35] they don't preach about angels because
[2:04:37] the sadducees did not believe in angels
[2:04:41] the pharisees believe in angels but they
[2:04:43] believe that angels only for heaven
[2:04:48] so joseph is scared to death
[2:04:51] he's afraid what am i going to do
[2:04:54] i love her so dearly she has never been
[2:04:57] me to me
[2:04:58] i cannot publicly disgrace her
[2:05:04] oh god help me
[2:05:06] oh god
[2:05:08] help me
[2:05:10] the bible said he was a just man
[2:05:13] now even in the time that he was quoting
[2:05:16] her because he was a responsible man he
[2:05:18] would not even try to fletch with her
[2:05:25] he will not get in no unclean thing with
[2:05:28] her
[2:05:28] because he wanted to respect her
[2:05:36] he's there oh god help me
[2:05:39] oh god help me
[2:05:42] lord help me what would i do
[2:05:45] can't even get a good sleep it's just
[2:05:48] trouble

[2:09:35] they were all dealing with things
[2:09:38] but yet
[2:09:40] god was visiting them
[2:09:43] in the coming of the lord
[2:09:45] and giving him consolation
[2:09:49] that i know what you're going through
[2:09:51] hannah

[2:10:07] of the coming of the lord
[2:10:11] when we are just going from one deaf
[2:10:13] news to another deaf news
[2:10:17] but god is still giving his people
[2:10:20] consolation
[2:10:24] we are still finding comfort and counsel
[2:10:27] in his word
[2:10:30] we can still raise our hands
[2:10:33] we can still clap our hands
[2:10:38] we can stay sink
[2:10:40] even if they want to have us to have the
[2:10:42] marks on we will have it on we will
[2:10:43] still think
[2:10:45] because we find consolation
[2:10:49] in his presence
[2:10:52] praise the lord
[2:10:55] a lot of people are working their mind
[2:10:57] out praying god they don't
[2:10:59] this is not strange to god he knows
[2:11:02] about this
[2:11:05] god gave his people consolation even in
[2:11:07] the lion then in the fires of phonics
[2:11:10] when his children were in captivity he
[2:11:12] still gave them consolation
[2:11:16] why should it be different for you
[2:11:19] why should your god only be the god that
[2:11:21] just do good
[2:11:22] things yes
[2:11:25] when others suffer
[2:11:28] spill their blood
[2:11:32] for this gospel
[2:11:35] god
[2:11:37] is going to comfort you
[2:11:40] in your hour of need
[2:11:42] no matter what you're dealing with
[2:11:45] he knows that
[2:11:47] better than you know it
[2:11:48] [Music]
[2:11:50] no matter whatever you dealing with
[2:11:56] praise the lord
[2:11:58] it's just that you have put something on
[2:12:00] your mind
[2:12:01] and you are demanding god to do it
[2:12:06] that's the disrespect of this age
[2:12:09] this is the age of defiant
[2:12:14] people put things on their mind and
[2:12:16] demand god to do it
[2:12:20] when the things that he's doing around
[2:12:22] them
[2:12:23] they never laid for their hands and said
[2:12:24] thank you jesus
[2:12:26] you've been so good to me thank you lord
[2:12:28] yes they don't see it
[2:12:31] why because
[2:12:33] they have put things on their mind and
[2:12:35] they are sticking god to the gun
[2:12:38] you either do it or you are not god
[2:12:41] what does he do or not
[2:12:43] he still remain my lord
[2:12:46] he stay still remaining my god
[2:12:48] amen
[2:12:56] oh what a god we serve
[2:12:59] oh what a god we serve what almighty god
[2:13:02] we serve
[2:13:04] praise the lord
[2:13:09] we might have a strong consolation
[2:13:16] making zeddy the great prince we might
[2:13:18] have a strong consolation
[2:13:22] who have fled
[2:13:24] for refuge
[2:13:33] to lay hold upon the hope that is set
[2:13:36] before us
[2:13:38] what a marvelous promise
[2:13:41] two immutable things
[2:13:44] god cannot lie and be god
[2:13:48] if god has made a promise in his bible
[2:13:52] we believe the bible
[2:13:54] to be the infallible word of god
[2:13:59] and if god has made a promise in this
[2:14:01] bible
[2:14:02] we have this consolation to know
[2:14:07] that it is impossible for him to lie yes
[2:14:12] we have this consolation to know
[2:14:16] that a god that ourselves he do not
[2:14:19] change
[2:14:20] he do not lie
[2:14:23] amen praise the lord
[2:14:27] oh my
[2:14:29] therefore when we see the promise
[2:14:32] when we see he promised it in the bible
[2:14:34] we believe it with our soul body and
[2:14:37] spirit
[2:14:39] it's impossible for him to lie
[2:14:42] if there is
[2:14:44] if there is any thought
[2:14:47] it is in us
[2:14:52] like i said a couple of weeks ago we
[2:14:53] must learn to honor for our failures
[2:14:59] we must learn to honor for our failure
[2:15:01] we must blame ourselves because god
[2:15:03] remained the same
[2:15:07] the almighty god is still dealing with
[2:15:09] people in visions he's still dealing
[2:15:11] with people in dreams he's still healing
[2:15:14] the sick he's still raising the dead
[2:15:17] he's still changing lives
[2:15:19] [Applause]
[2:15:32] we must learn to blame ourselves
[2:15:37] the problem is with us
[2:15:39] we have become too lazy
[2:15:42] to take god at his word
[2:15:46] we'll rather take what somebody said on
[2:15:48] facebook
[2:15:49] or on google
[2:15:51] then to take god
[2:15:53] [Music]
[2:16:00] if there is any fault it's in us not in
[2:16:02] god for god is obligated to his word
[2:16:07] and he has sown by himself
[2:16:10] amen
[2:16:13] praise the lord oh my god
[2:16:19] when we get to seeing it in that light
[2:16:21] things begin to shift up
[2:16:24] and keep up different
[2:16:28] than what we used to
[2:16:30] be healing
[2:16:33] of the body
[2:16:35] becomes affection
[2:16:40] it
[2:16:41] doesn't becomes a fiction it becomes a
[2:16:43] reality the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:16:46] doesn't become emotional workup
[2:16:50] it becomes a reality
[2:16:52] of the dwelling presence
[2:16:54] the reality of the dwelling presence
[2:16:58] the reality of the dwelling presence
[2:17:01] that reality is in you
[2:17:06] does that mean that you will not say a
[2:17:08] lie no
[2:17:09] you will tell a lie but that reality
[2:17:11] will say you just lie will make it right
[2:17:14] that's what the holy ghost will do
[2:17:17] sorry i said the wrong thing
[2:17:19] and we're wrong i said lord i made a
[2:17:20] mistake
[2:17:21] praise the lord
[2:17:23] that is the reality of the dwelling
[2:17:26] presence of the holy ghost
[2:17:29] [Music]
[2:17:32] it becomes a reality of the dwelling
[2:17:34] presence of the lord jesus christ
[2:17:38] to change the life
[2:17:42] if god promised
[2:17:43] that he saw
[2:17:46] no matter how much rise up to try to
[2:17:50] counterfeit or impersonate
[2:17:54] how many things rise up
[2:17:57] to contract date
[2:17:58] they can rise up and post whatever they
[2:18:01] want to post on facebook about this
[2:18:03] message
[2:18:05] we have the reality right here
[2:18:07] it has changed my life
[2:18:10] it has changed my life
[2:18:13] it's given me consolation
[2:18:23] you got to know the man you didn't get
[2:18:24] to know his message
[2:18:27] because his message was to turn our
[2:18:29] house back
[2:18:30] to the house of the father

[2:18:36] heard his message hallelujah
[2:18:38] thank you jesus hallelujah thank you
[2:18:41] lord
[2:18:53] how many things rise up and try to
[2:18:55] contradict or take it down
[2:18:58] i will go on and on and on oh god give
[2:19:02] me grace please lord give me grace let
[2:19:05] me go on and on and on
[2:19:10] for god has sown
[2:19:12] by himself
[2:19:14] that he will keep it right
[2:19:16] now whatever he preached
[2:19:18] whatever he promised he would keep it
[2:19:20] yes
[2:19:24] but brandon says if i fail to preach it
[2:19:26] and laid it down
[2:19:28] he said god will raise somebody up
[2:19:31] amen god will raise somebody up
[2:19:34] if you fail to live for god god will
[2:19:36] raise somebody up
[2:19:39] he's able of these stones
[2:19:41] to raise up children unto abraham
[2:19:46] you can go with your pump up
[2:19:48] prayer life go and do whatever you
[2:19:50] choose to do
[2:19:51] god will raise up of these stones
[2:19:58] if you fail to believe it there will be
[2:20:00] somebody step into your place
[2:20:02] [Music]
[2:20:04] to believe it
[2:20:06] instead of you
[2:20:08] this this particular statement
[2:20:10] became so real to me many years ago
[2:20:15] when i started as a young preacher that
[2:20:17] was back in 1994
[2:20:20] we had a house
[2:20:21] that we were in it was it was a melody
[2:20:23] guest house that was back back in
[2:20:25] liberia there
[2:20:26] uh uh
[2:20:28] and now we
[2:20:29] we were brothers but we have one room
[2:20:32] that we have as a prayer room
[2:20:37] we just kept that room as a prayer room
[2:20:39] if you want to pray just go in
[2:20:42] and uh so how i'll observe this over and
[2:20:46] over and over
[2:20:49] you know how
[2:20:50] right in the middle of the night you
[2:20:53] just feel that the lord woke you up
[2:20:55] to pray
[2:20:57] you just feel that
[2:20:59] amen
[2:21:01] and as soon as i slumber and start
[2:21:04] turning around the next thing i would
[2:21:05] hear somebody praying
[2:21:08] i would say oh god you wanted to talk to
[2:21:10] somebody
[2:21:11] and i didn't wake up to talk so you woke
[2:21:13] him up
[2:21:15] if you fail to believe god will raise up
[2:21:17] somebody to step in your place
[2:21:20] and believe
[2:21:25] i witnessed that over and over and over
[2:21:28] even till now i see it
[2:21:33] sometimes i have a burden on my heart
[2:21:34] something overseas or something i want
[2:21:36] to do and i prayed about it and prayed
[2:21:38] about god you know and when it's need to
[2:21:41] be done god will raise of somebody
[2:21:58] if you fail to believe it there will be
[2:22:00] somebody step into your place
[2:22:03] to believe it instead of you for god
[2:22:05] have sown
[2:22:06] he will do it
[2:22:08] oh what a consolation that gave us
[2:22:13] and the beautiful part about it my
[2:22:15] christian friends
[2:22:17] is to think that now
[2:22:19] we have the evidence
[2:22:21] we have a we have a year in blessing
[2:22:25] we have it in power
[2:22:28] we have it a miracle

[2:22:35] we have the evidence
[2:22:37] amen

[2:22:42] miracle we have it in science he said we
[2:22:45] have it even in picture
[2:22:48] what i just show you
[2:22:51] some evidence of his presence
[2:22:57] a pillar of fire
[2:23:00] we have it in every way that god has
[2:23:03] promised it more than
[2:23:06] he promised to give it to us
[2:23:09] musicians you can come

[2:23:14] the prophet
