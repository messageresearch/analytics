[39:47] God bless you Reverend Reese
[39:50] happy to have you back tonight God bless
[39:52] you all Saints
[39:54] yes
[39:55] so as I said brother one called me just
[39:58] a while ago
[39:59] and his sense is great
[40:07] like we are starting a little earlier
[40:09] than them
[40:10] so remember him in your prayers
[40:15] um he confess your prayers praise be to
[40:18] God
[40:19] and there is a praise report here
[40:22] from sis Kelly
[40:25] um since Kelly wants to say thank you
[40:27] for the church praying for the
[40:30] brother-in-law he is doing well and will
[40:34] be discharged to go home soon
[40:36] praise God for answering our prayers
[40:41] our God is a prayer answering God
[40:45] there is no prayer God has not answered
[40:49] you may be wondering what I'm what I'm
[40:51] talking about
[40:52] and I say it again there is no prayer
[40:55] God has not answered
[40:58] God has answered every single prayer
[41:04] now we have our definition I don't even
[41:06] know where I'm going with this
[41:08] praise be to God we have our definition
[41:11] for an answered prayer
[41:14] that when we pray for something and we
[41:17] see it also God has answered the prayer
[41:19] but if it does not happen
[41:22] in the way we were expecting it then God
[41:25] has not answered it but I'm here to tell
[41:27] you tonight that God answers every
[41:30] single prayer now the beautiful thing
[41:33] about prayer is that when you pray God
[41:37] will change the circumstances
[41:41] or
[41:42] God will leave the circumstances the way
[41:45] they are
[41:47] the very thing you are running away from
[41:49] the very thing you want God to take away
[41:52] from you God will live it and it will be
[41:55] staring at you in the face
[41:57] and you'll be prayed and prayed and
[41:58] praying and you'll be asking yourself
[42:00] why God is not answering the prayer God
[42:03] has answered that prayer
[42:04] guess what he is using that very
[42:07] circumstances
[42:09] to work on you
[42:14] we can talk about Paul
[42:17] hey he prayed and prayed and prayed and
[42:19] wished that God had taken
[42:21] I mean he wasn't seen well in his eyes
[42:23] and God never took it away God told him
[42:25] my grace is sufficient for you
[42:29] and brother Brown would tell us that God
[42:31] used that to work on Paul to Humble him
[42:38] so God answers
[42:41] every single prayer praise be to God as
[42:44] I was seated in the pastor's office just
[42:46] getting ready to come over a few things
[42:48] just came on my mind and um I just
[42:51] jotted them down because they were not
[42:53] part of it says every service
[42:57] just remember
[42:59] that our sacrifices would never go in
[43:03] vain
[43:08] whatever sacrifices you are making for
[43:11] the kingdom of God
[43:14] would never be in vain
[43:19] driving through the snow through the
[43:21] call to come to church
[43:23] that even when you are not able to make
[43:25] it to church and you are home
[43:28] you still want to log in
[43:30] and to be part of the service
[43:33] when you could be flipping channels that
[43:35] is in case if you have a television at
[43:37] home or maybe doing something else but
[43:40] you want to be part of the service all
[43:41] the same even though you are not present
[43:43] here
[43:45] your sacrifices would never be in vain
[43:48] every service
[43:50] takes you a step closer
[43:54] praise be to God
[43:59] every devotion
[44:01] takes you a step closer
[44:04] every Bible verse takes you a step
[44:08] closer
[44:09] and never get weary
[44:11] in your work with God never get tired
[44:17] of course we are making sacrifices
[44:20] but between us and the Lord who made the
[44:23] most sacrifice
[44:26] praise be to God so once again
[44:29] God bless you all for coming and if you
[44:31] can just stand for the reading of the
[44:33] word
[44:34] I would appreciate it if for any reason
[44:36] you can't stand you can be you can
[44:37] remain seated praise God shall we open
[44:41] our Bibles to
[44:42] Isaiah 50 uh sorry Isaiah 21

[49:52] time
[49:54] not only is it night
[49:56] but it is dark
[50:00] not only is it dark it is Pitch Black
[50:06] the darkest moment in human history we
[50:10] are living in it
[50:14] and there is a lot
[50:17] that is going on
[50:21] because
[50:23] it is dark
[50:27] look at morals
[50:29] the moral decay
[50:32] the moral Decay that has swapped the
[50:34] Earth surface
[50:36] that men have become so corrupt
[50:40] so morally decayed
[50:43] so rotten so filthy that Humanity has
[50:48] sunk so low

[50:58] there is no no more there's no more
[51:01] place to go
[51:02] that is how filthy it is
[51:04] that men want to become women
[51:07] want to become men
[51:10] so much confusion
[51:14] in the schools

[51:19] and you think their case and they come
[51:22] back
[51:23] hmm
[51:24] right and they are not the kids you know
[51:27] why because
[51:29] the educational system
[51:31] think that a child that age should be
[51:34] taught something that
[51:36] is adult content
[51:40] and even some of the teachers
[51:42] don't feel comfortable teaching that
[51:45] but they teach it because it is part of
[51:47] the curriculum
[51:51] there was a lady that was fired because
[51:53] of that
[51:56] there is so much moral decay
[51:59] so much rottenness and so much filth
[52:03] that is how dark and convoluted the
[52:06] world we are living in today is
[52:14] no wonder
[52:16] the other day China was making fun of us
[52:20] China said
[52:22] only 26 percent
[52:25] of American males are eligible
[52:29] to be enlisted into the army
[52:32] and guess what reason they gave
[52:34] they said because the men have all
[52:37] become uh transgenders
[52:43] no it was this by
[52:48] it is so rotten
[52:52] that instead of hiding this evil they
[52:55] can come out they have their death to
[52:57] celebrate and they are in their colors
[52:58] and their streets for the world to see
[53:00] them
[53:02] Lord have mercy
[53:08] and they are breaking homes left right
[53:10] and Senna
[53:15] this world has become so so corrupt
[53:19] we are living in the darkest moment of
[53:23] human history
[53:25] it couldn't be worse than
[53:28] Western it is today
[53:35] and the churches have let the people
[53:37] down
[53:42] their people are not told the truth
[53:47] so much so
[53:50] that two men can walk to a church or two
[53:53] women can walk to a church and the
[53:55] pastor will bless their Union
[53:57] what a shame
[53:59] why is the position of the church
[54:06] we don't tell the people the truth
[54:09] we make them to feel it's all right it's
[54:11] okay
[54:15] and what we do we toy
[54:19] with the salvation of the people
[54:23] and once your salvation is begin is
[54:27] being toyed with
[54:28] your Eternal destination
[54:30] is stored with
[54:38] any day
[54:40] could be the day
[54:44] if you listen to news
[54:47] you can tell
[54:50] sometimes when you are going to bed
[54:53] I am not talking of us here because we
[54:56] have a hope and eternal God
[54:58] [Music]
[54:59] we are expecting that to happen so if it
[55:01] happens tonight it's not going to be by
[55:03] surprise
[55:05] we are not going to be taken by surprise
[55:09] we are expecting it to happen
[55:12] but there are a lot of people that are
[55:15] going to be overtaken by surprise
[55:20] news
[55:23] and you are going to bed
[55:26] sometimes you'll be wondering which side
[55:28] of the bed you'll be waking up from the
[55:29] following morning
[55:31] because there is so much so much
[55:35] pressure that's not even the word I want
[55:38] to use
[55:40] so much chaos
[55:43] with with Russia China uh North Korea
[55:47] coming together against America and her
[55:50] allies
[55:51] and they keep threatening and these are
[55:54] nuclear Nations
[55:55] they keep threatening
[55:57] to deploy their nuclear arsenals against
[55:59] the U.S
[56:00] and her allies
[56:03] and they keep talking about it over and
[56:05] over
[56:06] one day will be the day they will just
[56:07] press the button
[56:09] mm-hmm
[56:14] it just takes a second
[56:16] for somebody to press the button because
[56:18] they have just talked about it way too
[56:20] much
[56:25] it is night time watch man
[56:28] what of the night
[56:31] Watchman what of the night
[56:34] now
[56:35] in fact
[56:38] um
[56:39] in in in
[56:44] turkey
[56:45] and Syria
[56:48] there was an earthquake
[56:51] there was an earthquake now just look at
[56:54] this
[56:57] when they woke up that morning
[56:59] it was another day
[57:03] the sun rose from the East
[57:10] see his color
[57:13] the wind was just blowing as usual
[57:19] the trees were just dancing as usual
[57:23] people went to work
[57:25] people went out they had fun
[57:29] people just went about their daily
[57:30] activities
[57:33] everything was normal
[57:37] there was no trumpet in the skies
[57:39] saying that something is going to happen
[57:41] watch out
[57:43] don't sleep in your homes today go to
[57:45] the forest and sleep
[57:48] that may be funny but if they had all
[57:51] gone to the forest probably driving
[57:52] better
[57:54] everything was normal
[57:57] they went to bed everything was normal
[58:00] they had their plans
[58:02] this is what I'm going to do tomorrow
[58:04] this is what I'll do next month this is
[58:06] what I'll do next year in 10 years is
[58:08] what I want to be 100 years is what I
[58:10] want to be and they had all their plans
[58:12] very well said they went to bed and they
[58:16] expected that things were going to be
[58:18] the same
[58:19] the following morning
[58:21] but earthquake struck
[58:25] and guess what the earthquake lasted
[58:28] only 45 seconds
[58:32] 45 seconds less than one minute this is
[58:36] why you would know that it doesn't take
[58:38] much
[58:39] to change a month
[58:42] 's life
[58:44] 45 seconds
[58:47] and in 45 seconds
[58:50] I don't know that no they've told now
[58:52] the last time I checked probably four or
[58:54] five days ago it was 50 000. and they
[58:58] are still counting
[59:00] those cities of turkey and Syria
[59:04] and Syria
[59:06] just in 45 seconds
[59:09] became a slum
[59:11] in 45 seconds
[59:14] that beauty that building those High
[59:17] strippers
[59:18] became a slum
[59:22] it was played with Darkness
[59:25] in 45 seconds
[59:28] orphans were made
[59:31] in 45 seconds
[59:33] widows were made in 45 seconds widowers
[59:39] were made
[59:41] in 45 seconds people lost their entire
[59:45] life savings
[59:46] their entire life Investments everything
[59:49] they ever struggled for went down the
[59:52] drains
[59:53] right what is the value of life without
[59:55] Christ
[59:57] what is the
[59:58] is the without Christ in your life
[1:00:02] your life first the kingdom
[1:00:05] and all other things shall be added unto
[1:00:07] you
[1:00:08] put your materialities ahead of God
[1:00:12] praise be to God in 45 seconds
[1:00:17] the situation changed completely
[1:00:20] irreversibly completely done
[1:00:23] I don't know whether that is English
[1:00:24] please be to God
[1:00:28] in 45 seconds
[1:00:31] and guess what
[1:00:34] when all the other countries in the
[1:00:36] world that will send
[1:00:37] um Aid
[1:00:39] send Aid
[1:00:41] send man
[1:00:43] onto the field
[1:00:45] rescue us with their rescue dogs guess
[1:00:49] what they didn't go looking for gold
[1:00:51] they were not going there to sign these
[1:00:53] nice deals
[1:00:54] they were not going down on Excursion
[1:00:57] they were going there for one thing
[1:00:59] to look for Souls
[1:01:01] it tells you how important your life is
[1:01:05] how we ought to love one another
[1:01:08] how we ought to love one another
[1:01:12] put all those
[1:01:13] all those two small things behind us and
[1:01:16] let's just forge afford ahead with one
[1:01:19] common purpose
[1:01:21] praise be to God
[1:01:23] and there is one picture that has just
[1:01:25] stuck with me
[1:01:26] that a little girl a little girl
[1:01:29] probably the age publish is about
[1:01:33] maybe maybe
[1:01:35] three years Maybe
[1:01:38] a little girl
[1:01:40] this girl was taken out of the rubble
[1:01:44] she couldn't even cry anymore
[1:01:47] she may have cried and cried and cried
[1:01:49] and cried
[1:01:52] taken out of the rebel by a complete
[1:01:54] stranger a complete stranger
[1:01:57] and I would expect a girl that age to
[1:02:00] look at this man in the face and start
[1:02:02] crying because he's never seen this man
[1:02:04] from Adam
[1:02:08] and then the girl looks at the man in
[1:02:10] his face like this
[1:02:12] and then she pushed her head on his
[1:02:14] shoulder
[1:02:17] praise be to God
[1:02:23] in 45 seconds now as I
[1:02:26] was talking about it
[1:02:28] as I was thinking about it
[1:02:31] I started thinking
[1:02:33] I said what if there was somebody
[1:02:38] that night
[1:02:41] that was spoken to
[1:02:44] give your life to Christ
[1:02:46] give your life to Christ and the person
[1:02:49] was convicted to do it and said to
[1:02:51] himself you know I am still young let me
[1:02:54] wait till I am old
[1:02:58] oh you know
[1:03:00] um I can do it another time I don't have
[1:03:02] to do it now oh is that we give myself
[1:03:04] time let me enjoy my youth
[1:03:10] what does it mean to say you want to
[1:03:12] enjoy your youth
[1:03:16] without Christ there is no enjoyment
[1:03:20] you put your life on the line
[1:03:28] like that and they said no I'll wait and
[1:03:31] do it tomorrow or next week or next
[1:03:32] month or when I'm 20 years or when I'm
[1:03:34] 100 years and that night
[1:03:37] that happened they never stood the
[1:03:39] chance
[1:03:41] that is why the Bible says that this day
[1:03:44] tomorrow not
[1:03:48] when you hear the voice of God hardly
[1:03:51] not your heart
[1:03:55] hiding not your hearts
[1:03:59] we don't come to church for the fun of
[1:04:00] it
[1:04:03] we don't just come
[1:04:06] just go he's just trying to let me no
[1:04:08] you come with a purpose there is
[1:04:10] something on your heart you want more of
[1:04:12] God
[1:04:15] that is why we are here we want to be
[1:04:18] talk to you we want God to talk to us
[1:04:21] and in every single service make sure
[1:04:24] you take something out of it
[1:04:27] in every single service make sure you
[1:04:30] are taking something out of their
[1:04:31] service
[1:04:32] when you open your bible to read make
[1:04:35] sure you are taking something out of it
[1:04:37] if it's a morning devotion even in
[1:04:39] devotion I don't care if it is five
[1:04:41] seconds of 10 minutes make sure you get
[1:04:44] something out of it
[1:04:47] praise be to God
[1:04:50] we are living in the darkest moment of
[1:04:54] human history
[1:04:57] tomorrow waits for no man
[1:05:05] don't wait for tomorrow
[1:05:09] I'm not saying tomorrow will not come
[1:05:12] tomorrow may not come
[1:05:14] that's what I'm saying but don't wait
[1:05:16] for it what you can do today
[1:05:20] do it today
[1:05:23] praise be to God
[1:05:26] watch man
[1:05:29] word of the nights
[1:05:31] who is a Watchman by the way
[1:05:36] in those days they will build their
[1:05:39] cities and they will work around it
[1:05:42] just for the security of the people and
[1:05:45] that wasn't enough
[1:05:46] they are going to raise a tower
[1:05:49] and the car is always higher than the
[1:05:52] the city walls
[1:05:54] and in that Tower they will put a
[1:05:57] Watchman
[1:06:00] The Watchman was not just a novice
[1:06:04] he was not just any person
[1:06:09] they didn't go down the street somewhere
[1:06:11] and they catch somebody said you are
[1:06:13] just going to be here no
[1:06:15] because they knew the importance of the
[1:06:17] Watchmen that the lives of the people in
[1:06:20] the city depended on what the Watchman
[1:06:23] would say
[1:06:24] praise be to God
[1:06:26] so they put somebody
[1:06:30] of integrity
[1:06:32] somebody that had an understanding of
[1:06:35] the heavenly bodies
[1:06:36] because the Watchman sat in that Tower
[1:06:39] and he heard with him a book of
[1:06:42] astronomy
[1:06:43] yes and when somebody comes out of the
[1:06:45] night and he cries out Watchman one of
[1:06:48] the night the prayer of God says that
[1:06:51] the Watchman will just look at the stars
[1:06:53] and then tell that person what time
[1:06:56] of the day it is
[1:06:59] and the person goes back to bed
[1:07:02] Watchman
[1:07:05] he was not just anybody
[1:07:09] a special person
[1:07:15] and what was the duty of the Watchman
[1:07:19] his duty was to tell the people the time
[1:07:23] of the day
[1:07:27] one of the night
[1:07:30] starts he loses his book as of astronomy
[1:07:32] oh it's 4 am in the morning
[1:07:35] so you know how close
[1:07:38] you are to Daybreak
[1:07:42] not just the time so you know how close
[1:07:46] you are to Daybreak
[1:07:49] and not only that he was also supposed
[1:07:53] to warn the people of oncoming Danger
[1:07:57] that he sat on the tower and he had a
[1:08:01] full 360 degree
[1:08:04] View
[1:08:05] around the city
[1:08:07] that if he saw anything coming
[1:08:10] maybe horses and chariots
[1:08:13] just coming towards the city
[1:08:16] with a dust billowing
[1:08:19] he will just sound his trumpet and when
[1:08:21] the people hear that trumpet they know
[1:08:23] that this is a sound for war and they
[1:08:26] just go in and they meet the enemy house
[1:08:28] outside
[1:08:30] so they don't they don't they don't just
[1:08:32] sit down and the enemy comes in and
[1:08:35] takes them on away
[1:08:38] and Brennan said
[1:08:41] that when the Watchman
[1:08:43] sees anything
[1:08:45] and does not tell the people
[1:08:49] and the enemy comes in
[1:08:52] and overtake the city
[1:08:54] God is going to require their blood from
[1:08:57] his hands
[1:09:00] that is how
[1:09:03] it is how the Watchman is
[1:09:05] that the lives of the people
[1:09:08] depended on what the Watchman sees and
[1:09:11] what the Watchman says
[1:09:14] and those who know they are Watchmen
[1:09:17] don't take things for granted
[1:09:19] now when the Washburn sells the alarm
[1:09:23] they don't go in and lock the door and
[1:09:25] sleep
[1:09:26] because they know there is danger coming
[1:09:28] they'll come from the danger
[1:09:36] that is a Watchman
[1:09:38] and that is the duty of a Watchman
[1:09:40] praise be to God
[1:09:42] and those who know their Watchmen praise
[1:09:44] be to God as I said they don't play with
[1:09:47] what he says
[1:09:48] and that is the way
[1:09:51] we esteem our Prophets
[1:09:55] and esteem his ministry
[1:09:58] and we don't joke with anything the
[1:10:00] prophet of God has said because we know
[1:10:03] it is between life and death
[1:10:07] but brother says that the prophets of
[1:10:10] God are Watchmen
[1:10:13] and they are likened unto Eagles
[1:10:18] and we know as we have heard the story
[1:10:20] over and over
[1:10:22] an eagle is just an eagle not like any
[1:10:25] other bird
[1:10:27] like a prophet of God
[1:10:29] not any ordinary human being
[1:10:32] like he said in this message
[1:10:34] that the people who don't go and take
[1:10:36] our Iron Man
[1:10:38] to go and sit on the tower
[1:10:40] oh they will not take somebody
[1:10:42] who is short-sighted to go and sit on
[1:10:45] that Tower
[1:10:46] because they know the importance of the
[1:10:49] Watchmen
[1:10:50] so it's not just inner body
[1:10:53] right and the promise of God are not
[1:10:55] just any bodies
[1:10:58] when you read the book of Jeremiah 1 5
[1:11:01] God was telling Jeremiah
[1:11:04] that before he was born he was ordained
[1:11:07] he knew him and he ordained him a
[1:11:10] prophet
[1:11:14] they are God chosen vessels
[1:11:18] and these are men
[1:11:21] that can go into the inner mind of God
[1:11:24] and bring to the people the mind of God
[1:11:26] they'll go to the inner cause of God and
[1:11:29] they bring to the people that sayeth the
[1:11:31] Lord
[1:11:32] they tell you what it is and the way it
[1:11:35] is
[1:11:36] they don't sugarcoat the word of God
[1:11:39] to make you feel comfortable with it
[1:11:42] so you can swallow it and feel
[1:11:44] comfortable no
[1:11:46] they just give it to you the way it is
[1:11:49] men that are prepared men that are
[1:11:52] chosen of God
[1:11:53] with that task
[1:11:57] and the prophets of God
[1:12:00] our Watchmen
[1:12:02] and like the eagles
[1:12:04] the Father the eagle goes in the skies
[1:12:07] the father it sees
[1:12:10] like the word the worst part on the
[1:12:13] tower
[1:12:15] see father
[1:12:18] and the prayer of God says God has given
[1:12:21] His prophets
[1:12:22] those spiritual eyes
[1:12:25] and they can see the forests
[1:12:28] far beyond any human being can see
[1:12:31] far beyond what the carnal eyes can see
[1:12:35] and what they see they declare it to the
[1:12:38] people
[1:12:41] now
[1:12:42] when the prophet of God
[1:12:44] who is our Watchman
[1:12:46] sees something
[1:12:48] and he declares it
[1:12:53] praise be to God
[1:12:55] like my brother has said over and over
[1:12:58] he is obligated
[1:13:01] to tell you the truth
[1:13:03] to give you the word
[1:13:05] but he is not obligated to what you do
[1:13:08] with it
[1:13:10] that is in your hands
[1:13:13] The Watchman is obligated to sound a
[1:13:16] warning
[1:13:17] to tell you there is danger coming
[1:13:22] you can decide to take it
[1:13:24] or you can decide to forget it
[1:13:27] but he has sounded a warning
[1:13:31] he has done his work now the ball is in
[1:13:34] your court
[1:13:35] what you do with it
[1:13:37] what you do with it depends on you
[1:13:44] we have the truth
[1:13:46] we have the truth
[1:13:48] God is so gracious
[1:13:51] time will not permit us
[1:13:53] but I can tell you
[1:13:56] from being a Catholic to a Muslim and
[1:13:58] through all those religions African
[1:14:01] traditional religion and all those
[1:14:02] things there was something in me that
[1:14:05] was not satisfied
[1:14:06] and I kept looking for something if you
[1:14:09] ask me brother what are you looking for
[1:14:11] to tell you the truth I couldn't tell
[1:14:13] you what I was looking for
[1:14:14] but I was looking for something I have
[1:14:17] told the story a thousand times already
[1:14:18] praise be to God is going to be Thousand
[1:14:21] and One today
[1:14:27] praise the Lord
[1:14:30] I didn't know what I was looking for
[1:14:33] I just didn't know but I knew I was
[1:14:36] looking for something and praise be to
[1:14:38] God that night when I heard the true
[1:14:40] word praise
[1:14:42] be to God I said to myself this is what
[1:14:45] I've been looking for all these years
[1:14:50] praise be to God
[1:14:52] this is what I've been looking for all
[1:14:54] these years and at the time I didn't
[1:14:57] even know that God has sent a prophet on
[1:15:00] to us I didn't know
[1:15:02] it was when I started visiting then I
[1:15:06] realized that oh so God has sent us a
[1:15:08] prophet and his name is William Branham
[1:15:11] who is this man
[1:15:13] then another Barrel started
[1:15:17] praise be to God
[1:15:21] God would never leave his children in
[1:15:24] Arrow
[1:15:27] I don't care what anybody says about the
[1:15:30] prophet I don't care what anybody says
[1:15:32] about the message one thing I can say
[1:15:34] for a fact that this message has made me
[1:15:37] a better person
[1:15:42] through
[1:15:45] I used to fear death
[1:15:48] man I don't fear death anymore
[1:15:50] as a matter of fact death yes me
[1:15:56] praise the Lord
[1:16:00] death is just a vehicle once upon a time
[1:16:03] it was so terrible to think about dying
[1:16:07] when they talk of death
[1:16:09] but you know it's just a vehicle
[1:16:11] that transports you from this natural
[1:16:15] into it across the divide into the
[1:16:19] presence of God
[1:16:23] I don't fear death
[1:16:26] in any case God has delivered me from
[1:16:28] Death countless number of times
[1:16:31] I can't count to tell you the truth what
[1:16:34] I can personally count maybe maybe five
[1:16:36] or six
[1:16:37] but out of everyone I believe there are
[1:16:39] three or four I didn't know about
[1:16:44] so that tells me
[1:16:47] that a day you guys hear I have no more
[1:16:50] I don't care what is 100 feet or 20 feet
[1:16:53] or three miles or three kilometers down
[1:16:56] the ocean if you don't get to see me
[1:16:59] again by the grace of God on that day
[1:17:01] when that family of God shall be sounded
[1:17:03] we will meet there in the skies
[1:17:05] okay
[1:17:10] praise be to God
[1:17:13] yes
[1:17:15] I can hear somebody saying hmm
[1:17:19] praise the Lord
[1:17:32] yeah
[1:17:34] yeah that's that's my baby girl
[1:17:40] and uh um again she's my mother
[1:17:45] yes
[1:17:47] I know when she's a baby girl and I know
[1:17:49] when she turns into her mother
[1:17:55] praise the Lord
[1:17:58] yes where are we
[1:18:07] sorry the prophets of God
[1:18:12] as we said
[1:18:15] we are eagles
[1:18:17] they are Watchmen
[1:18:21] and they see father
[1:18:23] than we see
[1:18:25] and what they see
[1:18:27] they declare it to us
[1:18:29] and that should arm you that should get
[1:18:32] you prepared because you know
[1:18:35] that the enemy
[1:18:36] is on the way
[1:18:38] and you are meeting the enemy head on
[1:18:41] praise be to God
[1:18:45] the prayer of God said that Jesus Christ
[1:18:47] himself
[1:18:50] what's a Watchman
[1:18:52] the king of eagles
[1:18:55] the king of eagles
[1:18:57] and that just before he's going away he
[1:19:01] spoke more about his second coming than
[1:19:04] he did
[1:19:05] in his going away
[1:19:07] praise be to God
[1:19:09] he was a Watchman now look at Jesus with
[1:19:14] his disciples telling them about how the
[1:19:17] temple was going to be destroyed how one
[1:19:19] stone will not be left sitting on the
[1:19:22] other and this may be wondering what is
[1:19:24] he talking about
[1:19:26] talking about earthquakes like we just
[1:19:28] talked about talking about wars talking
[1:19:30] about rumors of wars talking about moral
[1:19:33] Decay everything we are talking about
[1:19:35] today he talked about it
[1:19:37] whilst he was on this Earth's surface
[1:19:42] he was a Watchman the king of the Eagles
[1:19:47] and the days he foretold
[1:19:49] we are living in an age where we are
[1:19:52] seeing them being fulfilled we are
[1:19:55] seeing them with our very own eyes
[1:20:01] said
[1:20:02] that there was a great question
[1:20:06] and what was it
[1:20:10] Jesus knew he was going to die
[1:20:16] so
[1:20:17] it was not a question about whether he
[1:20:20] was going to die or not
[1:20:24] he knew that time of death he was going
[1:20:26] to die
[1:20:27] that he was going to die on the cross
[1:20:30] so that was not the question
[1:20:34] he knew that he was going to be buried
[1:20:39] so that was not a question
[1:20:42] and he knew that he was going to rise
[1:20:44] again there was no question about it
[1:20:47] because he had a Father's Promise
[1:20:50] that I would not leave a Holy One
[1:20:55] yes
[1:20:57] neither would I leave his soul in hell
[1:20:59] [Music]
[1:21:02] so he had the promise of the father
[1:21:04] so that was not a question
[1:21:07] and he knew that the Holy Ghost was
[1:21:09] going to come
[1:21:11] there was no question about that
[1:21:13] beverage said
[1:21:15] that there was a great question
[1:21:18] and let me read that here
[1:21:20] praise be to God
[1:21:26] the question was
[1:21:30] would there be any faith left on Earth
[1:21:34] at his coming
[1:21:40] all right
[1:21:41] will there be faith when he comes
[1:21:45] will he find people who believes his
[1:21:50] word
[1:21:54] will there be any faith at his coming
[1:21:57] would he come and still find people that
[1:22:01] are believing his word that are standing
[1:22:04] for the word that will do anything for
[1:22:07] the world that are prepared to give
[1:22:09] their lives for the word would he come
[1:22:12] and meet a people
[1:22:14] still standing for the truth
[1:22:17] that was the great question
[1:22:22] that was the great question
[1:22:27] we have heard the word of God time and
[1:22:30] again
[1:22:33] God has not left us in error
[1:22:39] if there are any that are perishing
[1:22:42] is not any of us
[1:22:44] because we know the truth
[1:22:49] what do you do with the word
[1:22:51] when the word comes to you
[1:22:55] what do you do
[1:22:57] I think somewhere down there I have a
[1:23:00] few things to be touching on so let me
[1:23:03] just
[1:23:04] um time I'm just a few minutes away
[1:23:08] will be fine by the grace of God
[1:23:14] and now
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:17] there is an oncoming Danger
[1:23:19] no man has the solution
[1:23:22] the Pentagon has no solution to it
[1:23:26] FBI has no solution to it
[1:23:28] they're more sad they don't have a
[1:23:30] solution to it the KGB doesn't know the
[1:23:33] solution
[1:23:35] there is no country in the world
[1:23:38] you as a mayor Russia mentioned them no
[1:23:43] country has the solution the prophet of
[1:23:45] God says who has the answer
[1:23:48] The Watchman
[1:23:49] has the answer
[1:23:52] The Watchman
[1:23:54] is the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit
[1:23:57] is the Watchman who is warning the
[1:24:00] people
[1:24:01] of what the oncoming Danger
[1:24:07] and Isaiah says
[1:24:11] and the night
[1:24:13] the morning is coming but the Night
[1:24:16] Comes First
[1:24:18] just before they break it turns darker
[1:24:22] than ever before the approaching light
[1:24:28] that makes it darker
[1:24:31] is the coming of the Lord that has made
[1:24:34] things darker
[1:24:36] the morning is coming for those who are
[1:24:39] prepared for the morning
[1:24:40] and the Knights
[1:24:43] is there for those who are not prepared
[1:24:46] for the morning
[1:24:48] so if you are prepared for the morning
[1:24:52] there is a morning coming for you
[1:24:55] but if you are not prepared for the
[1:24:58] morning
[1:24:58] then you have the darkness to contend
[1:25:00] with
[1:25:04] it just to read something here very real
[1:25:06] quick from the from the message
[1:25:08] uh on my phone it was paragraph 67 to 71
[1:25:14] um watch
[1:25:16] how scriptural Isaiah was when he said
[1:25:19] Watchman one of the night he said the
[1:25:23] morning cometh and the night also what
[1:25:26] the morning comes by the Night comes
[1:25:29] before the morning
[1:25:32] what was it
[1:25:34] anyone knows that just before the
[1:25:36] breakup day
[1:25:37] just at the hours of the approaching day
[1:25:40] a tense darker than ever than it ever
[1:25:44] was
[1:25:45] oh my friends listening to that say yes
[1:25:49] the Lord
[1:25:50] if you consider me to be his servant
[1:25:55] is just before Daybreak
[1:25:58] praise be to God
[1:26:01] that is why this horrible Gloom is over
[1:26:05] the Earth
[1:26:06] is just before the coming of the Lord
[1:26:08] Jesus
[1:26:10] there is no more hope left
[1:26:12] ain't nothing but his coming
[1:26:15] nations are against Nations as we can
[1:26:18] see
[1:26:19] and they have food through God's
[1:26:22] Laboratory till they've got the power to
[1:26:26] blow one another into Atomic ashes can
[1:26:29] you imagine what will happen today
[1:26:31] because the U.S and Russia both
[1:26:35] have I think 95 or 96 percent of the
[1:26:38] world's nuclear Arsenal
[1:26:41] the rest of the countries just have
[1:26:43] small small but Russia and U.S control
[1:26:46] about 95 or 96 but U.S is the lead U.S
[1:26:52] has the most can you imagine if Russia
[1:26:56] makes a mistake and presses the button
[1:27:00] U.S is not going to sit down U.S is
[1:27:02] going to also press
[1:27:05] and China will press
[1:27:09] and that boy in North Korea will also
[1:27:11] press
[1:27:14] can you imagine what is going to happen
[1:27:16] on this Earth surface
[1:27:20] now say
[1:27:23] that the world has enough nuclear
[1:27:27] arsenals
[1:27:28] to to destroy this Earth
[1:27:31] several times over
[1:27:34] not once not twice
[1:27:36] several times over
[1:27:39] they have enough nuclear bombs to do
[1:27:42] that job
[1:27:44] it just takes one one person to start
[1:27:48] and the rest will follow suit
[1:27:52] that is how close
[1:27:54] how close
[1:27:55] we have come and by the time we get to
[1:27:58] the end of the service
[1:27:59] probably the picture will be clearer and
[1:28:02] they they are wicked and and they are
[1:28:04] already
[1:28:06] and they are on on christ-like
[1:28:09] and the only motive they have and
[1:28:12] objective is to destroy
[1:28:15] and they are inspired by the destroying
[1:28:18] angel
[1:28:18] that was sent from heaven to inspire
[1:28:21] this man
[1:28:23] let me say in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:27] the Holy Spirit has sent us
[1:28:31] a Watchman on the tower
[1:28:36] and as the people cry
[1:28:39] what of the night
[1:28:40] you are weary of this life are you weary
[1:28:43] of this life the problem of God is
[1:28:45] asking are you weary of this life
[1:28:48] or you still want to stay here
[1:28:53] it reminds me of the story in the Dark
[1:28:55] Ages
[1:28:58] why the Christians they killed them and
[1:29:00] killed them and killed them they
[1:29:01] couldn't kill them anymore
[1:29:02] and they just made that bonfire they dug
[1:29:05] a hole with fire and they were just
[1:29:06] pushing them in
[1:29:08] the Creator will just walk into it
[1:29:10] willingly
[1:29:12] willingly praise be to God
[1:29:14] now guess what even though they were
[1:29:17] working and jumping into the fire there
[1:29:19] was something God hid from them
[1:29:22] but can you imagine
[1:29:24] the soldiers that were there to make
[1:29:27] sure these guys perished there was a
[1:29:29] soldier that when a man jumps into the
[1:29:32] fire
[1:29:33] all he sees is the man's Soul going up
[1:29:37] into the heaven
[1:29:38] and it goes to this man
[1:29:41] and the man probably didn't want to go
[1:29:43] he still wanted to enjoy the Earth are
[1:29:46] you weary of this life
[1:29:47] are you weary are you tired of this life
[1:29:50] this man wanted
[1:29:53] to go
[1:29:54] and the soldier asked him you don't want
[1:29:56] to go the man was dragging his feet
[1:29:58] the Sawyer took his uniform and gave it
[1:30:00] to him
[1:30:01] and he jumped in
[1:30:07] I pray God will open our eyes to see
[1:30:12] I pray God will take the scales off our
[1:30:15] eyes so we can see
[1:30:19] praise be to God
[1:30:25] wherever you find yourself
[1:30:28] yeah we can look at our chest it's not
[1:30:31] because of what we are able to do we can
[1:30:33] do nothing
[1:30:34] on our own
[1:30:37] as someone said
[1:30:39] that the most beautiful and the most
[1:30:41] glorious things about our lives
[1:30:44] have nothing to do with us
[1:30:48] but everything to do with God is what
[1:30:51] God has done
[1:30:57] we ought to be so grateful to the
[1:30:59] almighty God
[1:31:02] I don't know about you but when I look
[1:31:04] behind me
[1:31:06] I can see where God took me from
[1:31:11] amen God Is So changing lives
[1:31:16] he said Breaking Chains
[1:31:20] he is the chain breaker
[1:31:25] any time could be the day
[1:31:27] I'm just a few minutes away praise
[1:31:29] Beauty God oh my I think we'll be good
[1:31:37] the money coming
[1:31:39] um
[1:31:40] are you weary of this life
[1:31:42] are you weary of sin
[1:31:44] are you wearing your funeral processions
[1:31:47] and sickness and ungodliness on every
[1:31:50] hand
[1:31:51] has the night been so long and weary
[1:31:55] what of the night Watchman he said the
[1:32:00] morning cometh see the comfort
[1:32:03] to know
[1:32:05] that even though you are going through
[1:32:06] the night even though you are going
[1:32:08] through trying times even though you are
[1:32:10] going through the headwind even though
[1:32:12] you are going through the problems
[1:32:13] sometimes as a matter of fact you can
[1:32:16] find yourself in the eye of the storm
[1:32:22] but then you can still feel the hand of
[1:32:24] God
[1:32:27] what a paradox
[1:32:28] but it is always true
[1:32:31] I believe
[1:32:33] you guys know what I'm talking about
[1:32:44] what the night look look how in in
[1:32:47] perfect harmony with the scripture
[1:32:49] Isaiah was
[1:32:51] in the regular course of nature always
[1:32:54] that the approaching of the Sun congeals
[1:33:00] the darkness together and makes it dark
[1:33:04] it's darker before it's darker before
[1:33:07] day
[1:33:08] than any time in the night why is the
[1:33:13] approaching light
[1:33:16] that that's making it dark
[1:33:19] and is the approaching of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:21] now that's bringing this Gloom upon the
[1:33:25] Earth
[1:33:27] did not he say when these things begin
[1:33:30] to come to pass
[1:33:32] lift up your head for your Redemption is
[1:33:36] drawing night
[1:33:39] so when you look at these things in the
[1:33:41] way they are happy you know the things
[1:33:42] that are going on
[1:33:44] it tells one thing
[1:33:46] that the coming of the Lord
[1:33:49] is very close at hand
[1:33:53] and if you know the coming of the Lord
[1:33:55] is very close at hand
[1:33:58] it tells what you do with your life
[1:34:02] you don't want the Lord to come and meet
[1:34:05] you in a place where he would not go
[1:34:09] you don't want the Lord to come and meet
[1:34:12] you doing something he would not do
[1:34:16] you want him to come and meet you
[1:34:18] prepared
[1:34:19] and when you know he's coming he's very
[1:34:21] close
[1:34:24] you are checking every single move
[1:34:28] you don't take this for granted
[1:34:30] you don't go with the flow
[1:34:35] it's just you
[1:34:36] and God
[1:34:42] if there was any time
[1:34:44] we ought to be praying
[1:34:47] it's now
[1:34:51] if there was any time
[1:34:54] we ought to take our prayers very
[1:34:56] seriously it's now
[1:34:58] I'm going to squeeze all this thing
[1:35:01] um
[1:35:02] we'll be fine
[1:35:05] um what is what is brother
[1:35:10] brother Hitler his brother his wife is
[1:35:12] here so I know he's around
[1:35:15] praise the Lord
[1:35:20] so there is only one great light
[1:35:22] before Daybreak
[1:35:24] and that's the Morning Star
[1:35:27] it gets brighter as the Earth gets
[1:35:31] darker and darker
[1:35:33] the morning light is reflecting the
[1:35:35] light of the Sun
[1:35:37] and at this point the prophet of God
[1:35:39] says that the other stars begin to dim
[1:35:43] when the other stars begin to dim that
[1:35:46] is when the Morning Star begins to shine
[1:35:49] brighter and brighter
[1:35:51] and the prayer of God says modern Stars
[1:35:53] rise
[1:35:55] and shine to the glory of God
[1:35:58] those who love God those who have the
[1:36:01] morning Stars light they
[1:36:05] um
[1:36:06] they are getting their eyes on him and
[1:36:10] after things of the world lift up your
[1:36:12] head
[1:36:13] once again
[1:36:15] for your Redemption is nigh
[1:36:19] praise be to God
[1:36:22] there is a total annihilation
[1:36:26] coming to the world
[1:36:29] but before the church
[1:36:32] before then before that total
[1:36:34] Annihilation the Church of Christ
[1:36:37] will be raptured to meet her Lord
[1:36:41] with all the unrest
[1:36:43] it could be any day
[1:36:46] with all the unrest it could be any day
[1:36:50] I'm going to speed up now
[1:36:53] so we are set
[1:36:56] with a message
[1:36:59] to prepare us
[1:37:02] that is a warning
[1:37:05] that there is an and an oncoming danger
[1:37:08] there is a danger approaching
[1:37:11] and we ought to be preparing ourselves
[1:37:14] we ought to be getting ourselves ready
[1:37:17] now
[1:37:20] just keep feeding on the word
[1:37:24] it's the word that changes your nature
[1:37:28] nothing else can do it
[1:37:33] do not let anything come between you and
[1:37:36] the word
[1:37:39] the word as a matter of facts is the
[1:37:42] strongest weapon that God ever gave men
[1:37:48] look at it
[1:37:49] when the Lord Jesus fasted 40 days and
[1:37:52] 40 nights and the devil came to attempt
[1:37:54] him what did he use he used the word
[1:37:59] he used his best Arsenal
[1:38:02] he used his best weapon
[1:38:05] and that was his word for there is
[1:38:08] nothing that is greater than the word of
[1:38:10] God
[1:38:14] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:38:16] was it God and the Word was God
[1:38:20] there is nothing that can defeat the
[1:38:22] Devil but God
[1:38:25] he used the word
[1:38:29] so we are giving the best Arsenal
[1:38:34] the best we are giving the best
[1:38:38] and the devil fears you when you are
[1:38:41] living by the word
[1:38:44] the devil doesn't bear it doesn't fear
[1:38:46] your prayer life
[1:38:47] if your life is crooked
[1:38:49] if you are living an ungodly life the
[1:38:52] devil doesn't have time for you you can
[1:38:54] pray for money till evening the devil
[1:38:56] can just come and sit there and look you
[1:38:59] finish praying and then he'll jump on
[1:39:01] you
[1:39:03] the only thing that scares the devil is
[1:39:06] the word
[1:39:08] is the word
[1:39:10] the Bible says they overcame by the
[1:39:12] words of their testimony
[1:39:15] praise be to God
[1:39:17] when you are living by the word you take
[1:39:20] in the word of God you are living by the
[1:39:23] word when the Devil comes he doesn't see
[1:39:25] you he sees God
[1:39:36] the word is so powerful as the Bible
[1:39:39] says that the word of God is quick and
[1:39:42] Powerful
[1:39:43] it's a scripture I love so much
[1:39:50] of the Soul and Spirit and of the Joyce
[1:39:53] and Marrow and he said he said of the
[1:39:54] person enters of the heart
[1:39:56] there is nothing that crushes the devil
[1:39:59] more than the word of God
[1:40:03] and as a matter of fact for you to live
[1:40:05] by the wife is a rebuke to the devil
[1:40:08] because the devil is telling people all
[1:40:10] over the world that nobody can live by
[1:40:12] the word so when you appear and you are
[1:40:14] living by the word the devil looks at
[1:40:16] you and he's ashamed of you
[1:40:21] there is so much power and authority in
[1:40:23] the word of God
[1:40:25] and when your life is right that is why
[1:40:28] the Bible says that the fervent prayer
[1:40:30] of the righteous availeth much
[1:40:35] and What Makes You righteous it's not
[1:40:37] your good works
[1:40:38] our righteousness is by faith
[1:40:48] amen when you are living by the word
[1:40:51] your prayer is very effective
[1:40:55] very effective why because the Life Is
[1:40:57] Right
[1:41:00] and if there is any time you ought to be
[1:41:02] praying is today
[1:41:05] but you can never have an effective
[1:41:07] prayer life if your life is not right
[1:41:13] we have a place to go I'm just here to
[1:41:16] remind ourselves
[1:41:17] that we have a place to go
[1:41:19] that one of these days it will all be
[1:41:21] over
[1:41:22] that we are living a darkest point of
[1:41:24] human history
[1:41:26] and one of these days
[1:41:28] it will all be over
[1:41:33] there is a place in his arms of love
[1:41:37] for every one of us
[1:41:40] How He Loves Us
[1:41:43] God loves us
[1:41:45] he loves us so much
[1:41:48] more than you think
[1:41:51] more than you would ever think more than
[1:41:54] you would ever imagine
[1:41:56] people who can understand the love of
[1:41:57] God
[1:42:03] don't look at you
[1:42:06] look at his word
[1:42:09] praise be to God
[1:42:28] yes
[1:42:30] the musicians can come over as
[1:42:35] I laid down my
[1:42:43] so
[1:42:46] as I said
[1:42:49] it was just an opportunity
[1:42:52] you know
[1:42:55] to straighten ourselves up if there is
[1:42:57] anything to straighten in our lives
[1:43:00] um God is working on us without a doubt
[1:43:05] God is working on us there is no doubt
[1:43:08] about it
[1:43:12] but you have to submit yourself
[1:43:17] in total times
[1:43:19] completely into his hands
[1:43:22] and let God work on you
[1:43:28] and the Highlight for me tonight
[1:43:31] is that do not take the word for granted
[1:43:37] do you know let it be something you can
[1:43:39] just hop in today and hoping and hop out
[1:43:42] tomorrow
[1:43:44] the Bible says here that puts his son to
[1:43:46] the plow
[1:43:47] and turns back it's not worthy of me
[1:43:53] God pays business with you
[1:43:56] and God wants you to mend business with
[1:43:58] him
[1:43:58] [Music]
[1:44:00] it's a relationship between you and God
[1:44:05] praise be to God
[1:44:08] just live by the word
[1:44:12] let the word of God take effect in your
[1:44:15] life
[1:44:20] that wherever you find yourself
[1:44:27] the word in you would create an
[1:44:30] atmosphere
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:34] get the Holy Ghost
[1:44:38] father is only one body that is going in
[1:44:41] the rapture
[1:44:44] and that is the body of Christ
[1:44:47] there is nobody that is going on their
[1:44:50] own Merit no you are not going on your
[1:44:52] own merits
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:44:57] there is only one body and that is the
[1:44:59] body of Christ
[1:45:02] and we are all part we are all members
[1:45:05] of this body
[1:45:08] for the Bible says by one spirits and we
[1:45:11] were placed into one body
[1:45:17] if you do not have the Holy Ghost ask
[1:45:19] God for it
[1:45:22] ask God for the holy ghosts
[1:45:25] Matthew 7 and I believe Luke 11 10
[1:45:28] thereabouts
[1:45:31] says that what father is there
[1:45:34] his son
[1:45:36] would ask for fish and he will give him
[1:45:39] a snake
[1:45:40] I will ask for bread
[1:45:43] and you give him a stone
[1:45:45] I don't care how Wicked a father is he
[1:45:48] will never do that
[1:45:51] and the Bible says if you've been evil
[1:45:55] know how to give Glory gifts unto your
[1:45:57] children how would a Heavenly Father
[1:45:59] give the Holy Ghost
[1:46:01] to them that ask him for ask for the
[1:46:04] Holy Ghost
[1:46:05] When you pray ask for the Holy Ghost
[1:46:11] because the Bible says
[1:46:14] today after ask
[1:46:18] they receive he does he can find it and
[1:46:22] to him that knock the door shall be
[1:46:24] opened
[1:46:26] it's a promise
[1:46:30] and God has promised us
[1:46:33] how he's going to pour the spirit Upon
[1:46:35] Our flesh
[1:46:36] in the Book of Joel
[1:46:38] praise be to God
[1:46:41] by what spirits are we baptized into one
[1:46:46] body we are all members parts of that
[1:46:50] same body
[1:46:54] that is why
[1:46:57] we want to make sure
[1:47:03] that we are not living together and
[1:47:05] fighting together
[1:47:09] praise be to God
[1:47:13] just want to thank the almighty God for
[1:47:16] this opportunity and I want us to go to
[1:47:18] God In Prayer
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:25] world will not go out and return void
[1:47:31] I know and I believe that God has spoken
[1:47:34] to you tonight
[1:47:38] and I wanted to talk to God tonight
[1:47:44] I want you to talk to God tonight
