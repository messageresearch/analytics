[0:54] previous
[0:55] lesson that we talked of that kinsman
[0:58] redeemer
[1:00] which we found out was christ
[1:04] typed it up with ruth ruth deciding
[1:07] ruth serving ruth resting
[1:10] deciding with justification
[1:13] serving making herself ready

[1:37] holy spirit and now
[1:39] resting
[1:39] [Music]
[1:42] waiting for the coming of our lord
[1:45] perfectly our kinsmen redeemer
[1:49] their elders was right when they called
[1:52] him a lamb
[1:53] about to become a lie and his judge he
[1:56] was
[1:56] a lamb you know with the seven seal book
[2:00] when the book was taken the meditorial
[2:03] work was finished now in the third
[2:08] chapter the church was gone up but
[2:11] now redemption is to be revealed how the
[2:15] church was
[2:16] redeemed the revelation
[2:20] of what taken place during the church
[2:22] age see the church is gone
[2:25] so he is now showing in the fifth
[2:28] chapter
[2:29] how he did it what taken place how he
[2:32] sealed the church all the revelation
[2:36] of his name water baptism used his name
[2:40] eternal life no eternal hell
[2:43] serpent seed eternal security all the
[2:47] great
[2:47] doctrines predestination all the church
[2:51] that was
[2:52] revealed to the church he's showing how
[2:55] he done it
[2:56] now our kinsmen is handed the seven
[2:59] sealed book of redemption from
[3:02] the original owner amen
[3:05] who what we find was the original owner
[3:08] god himself hallelujah
[3:11] and the lamb came and took the book out
[3:14] of the right hand of him that set up on
[3:16] a throne
[3:19] who was a lamb the redeemer
[3:23] our kinsmen redeemer
[3:26] the kinsmen to the church who come and
[3:30] redeemed
[3:31] israel now we're going to get into that
[3:32] this morning
[3:34] israel was redeemed but it was not
[3:37] applied to them
[3:39] because they rejected him but the church
[3:42] received their redemption
[3:44] amen and he is our
[3:47] kinsmen redeemer as
[3:50] boaz had to redeem neoma
[3:53] in order to get ruth them overnight
[3:57] an alien a gentile so
[4:00] christ redeemed israel
[4:04] applied the redemption and was rejected
[4:08] you remember the pardon that the man was
[4:11] shot that i sometimes tell
[4:13] during the civil war when he was a good
[4:16] man he was
[4:17] innocent and they found him guilty
[4:20] although he was guilty in a way that he
[4:23] run away in time of battle and they
[4:25] found him guilty and was going to shoot
[4:27] him and a man
[4:28] went to president lincoln and said mr
[4:30] lincoln this is a christian man
[4:32] he was a scared boy i know his people
[4:35] he was just afraid he didn't mean no
[4:37] harm you run away said mr lincoln it's
[4:40] in your hands you're the only one can
[4:41] pardon him
[4:42] mr lincoln picked up a piece of paper in
[4:45] his pen and signed
[4:46] pardon the soy and soy abraham lincoln
[4:49] he ran back to the jail and he said here
[4:51] it is
[4:52] i got your pardon and the man said i
[4:54] refuse to look at
[5:15] and the man said i refuse to look at it
[5:18] it would have a big seal on it it would
[5:20] be everything
[5:20] you're only trying to make me a
[5:23] laughingstock
[5:25] it is not abraham lincoln anybody could
[5:27] sign his name
[5:28] but it would have to be documented by
[5:31] his seal and so forth if it comes from
[5:33] him
[5:33] and the man persuaded him though the man
[5:35] in the prison thought he was kidding
[5:37] and just walked away the next morning he
[5:39] was shot
[5:41] and then after he was shot then there
[5:43] was a federal court
[5:45] trial because abraham lincoln 24 hours
[5:50] before the man was shot signed his name
[5:52] at this man was pardoned
[5:55] and then the government shot him anyhow
[5:59] then what then the federal court of the
[6:02] united states said
[6:04] come to this decision of the federal
[6:06] courts said
[6:07] a pardon is not a pardon
[6:10] unless it be received as a pardon
[6:13] and jesus redeemed
[6:17] israel at calvary
[6:21] but it was not important to them because
[6:24] they did not receive it as a pardon
[6:27] amen but in our lesson now in these 70
[6:30] weeks we find they'd come back and
[6:32] receive their pardon
[6:33] [Music]
[6:35] but he redeemed the church
[6:40] then we are pardoned because we have
[6:43] received the
[6:44] blood of jesus christ as our pardon
[6:48] now we find that he was our kinsmen
[6:52] redeemer
[6:53] and he took the book out of the hand of
[6:56] the original
[6:56] owner it is a titled
[7:00] deed to redemption we found that you
[7:03] remember the study
[7:05] it's a title deed of redemption
[7:09] am i it's an abstract deed with it
[7:14] that god required life for death
[7:18] in the garden of eden and jesus the
[7:21] righteous one
[7:22] died and took a title deed
[7:25] and was able to break the seals reveal
[7:30] what was in them
[7:32] and give the inheritance that belonged
[7:35] to him
[7:36] to his people
[7:40] eternal life that he inherited by doing
[7:42] that he passed his own life
[7:44] back out of calvary and divided it among
[7:46] us by the holy ghost
[7:48] amen amen no man has never been able to
[7:52] conquer to even think of the love that
[7:55] that was
[7:56] amen what are you doing satan the once
[7:58] possessor
[8:00] because of the fallen garden is bound
[8:02] and cast into a lake of fire
[8:04] his days are finished jesus and the
[8:07] gospel had four titles we caught them
[8:10] son of david heir to the throne son of
[8:12] abraham
[8:13] the royal grant son of man heir of the
[8:16] earth
[8:17] son of god hair all thing amen
[8:20] hallelujah royal grant in the old
[8:23] testament property could not be could
[8:26] not be held
[8:26] any longer than 50 years it could not be
[8:29] annihilated
[8:30] from its original owner but 50 years
[8:33] and on the 40th day he
[8:36] paid the price on the 50th day
[8:39] the redemption and the power that
[8:42] belonged to the church that was lost in
[8:44] the garden of eden was redeemed back and
[8:46] sent to us by the baptism of the holy
[8:48] ghost on the 50th day
[8:50] amen then we picked up this the
[8:54] scroll we picked up the scrolls how that
[8:57] this scroll was handed to his hand
[8:59] how the jeremiah and jeremiah 326
[9:02] this cousin hamill was uh left him some
[9:05] aaron that's going into captivity which
[9:07] we're going
[9:08] into with him this morning captivity
[9:11] and it was kept in an earthly vessel
[9:14] shows where the power of god and the
[9:15] scrolls and secrets of god is known in
[9:17] the heart
[9:20] our plan of redemption is same being
[9:22] kept in the earthly vessel
[9:25] jesus name in the revelation we find out
[9:28] that this was sealed with seven
[9:29] seals and each seal was wrapped around
[9:32] and as a revelation come forth he pulled
[9:34] the seal
[9:35] and undone this and read what that seal
[9:37] said then he undone the next one the
[9:39] scrolling
[9:39] read what that seal said undone the next
[9:42] one pull it out and see what that seal
[9:43] said and what the revelation was
[9:45] that's exactly what our seven seals that
[9:47] we're going into
[9:49] shortly we trust that we'll do each seal
[9:51] when he's tucked off the book will be
[9:53] unrolled and that will show exactly what
[9:55] taking place
[9:56] hallelujah we find out that there's
[9:59] seven
[10:00] five in the plan of redemption five is a
[10:03] number
[10:04] and these five seven seven sealed seven
[10:07] spirits seven angels seven uh trumpets
[10:10] and
[10:10] seven church ages so you see
[10:13] the five sevens is grace five is grace
[10:16] and seven is perfection
[10:19] so it's just perfectly running just
[10:21] exactly see
[10:23] all right like each seal broken in the
[10:26] word of god
[10:27] reveals to the man
[10:31] of the age what age we're living in the
[10:33] spirit of age
[10:35] the church of the age
[10:38] revelations 10 at the end we find when
[10:41] the last seal was broke we find
[10:43] the angel standing with one foot on the
[10:45] land and one on the sea with his hands
[10:47] up to heaven and a rainbow over his head
[10:49] swearing by him that lives forever and
[10:51] ever that time has run out
[10:54] amen on the last seal and you wait till
[10:56] we get to them seals and see where that

[15:58] confirm
[15:59] the covenant listen with many for
[16:02] one week one of these seventy weeks
[16:06] and in the midst of the wheat he shall
[16:09] cause a sacrifice an
[16:11] oblent to cease and for the
[16:14] over-spreading of
[16:15] abomination he shall make it desolate
[16:19] even unto the consummation
[16:23] and that determined
[16:26] shall be poured upon the desolate
[16:31] now there is our lesson for the next
[16:34] three four
[16:35] five beating whatever the lord
[16:38] will reveal seventy
[16:41] of weeks now i'll
[16:45] ask doc if he will tonight
[16:48] to put up my board there
[16:51] so that i'll be able to mark it out i
[16:53] don't want you to miss it
[16:55] now you've got to study with me and
[16:57] study deep
[16:59] or you'll miss it and i want to draw it
[17:01] out you're on the blackboard and then
[17:03] you bring your pencils and paper and
[17:04] write down these dates
[17:06] these times and all about
[17:10] now the 70 weeks begins
[17:14] now i get this after
[17:17] the church is taken out
[17:21] now everybody understands that say amen
[17:24] amen
[17:25] now after the church is taken out
[17:29] revelation 6 1 to revelations
[17:32] 19 20 ma one is connected with the 70
[17:37] weeks
[17:37] therefore we must stop and explain
[17:41] before we go further we must stop and
[17:46] explain
[17:47] why these 70 weeks because if you don't
[17:50] you'll miss or seal
[17:52] you'll miss those trumpets you'll miss
[17:54] those vile
[17:55] those flags those three unclean spirits
[17:58] like frogs
[17:59] those three woes the casting out of the
[18:01] red dragon
[18:02] the woman in the sun you'll miss it all
[18:04] if you don't because it takes place
[18:06] right here in the 70th week
[18:09] all right that's where it takes place
[18:13] now the prophet daniel had been
[18:16] in babylon for 68 years you who wants to
[18:21] run references back
[18:22] and save yourself some of the time that
[18:24] i've had to looking it up
[18:26] 68 years he went into captivity
[18:30] in bc 606
[18:33] and when the vision came to him was was
[18:36] bc 538
[18:38] 538 from 606 leads 68
[18:42] 68 years he had been
[18:45] in babylon amongst eden and still had
[18:48] the victory
[18:49] amen we can't stay out
[18:54] but he had been in the very midst with
[18:56] nobody but
[18:57] three companions and them in different
[19:00] parts of the kingdom
[19:02] but daniel's standing alone with god
[19:06] amen helped the victory for 68 years
[19:12] think of it i don't want to start
[19:14] preaching because this is supposed to be
[19:16] a teaching lesson
[19:17] but 68 years he had
[19:20] kept the victory and was undefiled
[19:22] before god
[19:24] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[19:28] without the blood of jesus christ make
[19:31] intercessions for him
[19:33] with only the blood of bulls and goats
[19:35] and heifers
[19:37] which he had to offer secretly
[19:40] because of the heathen traditions of
[19:42] that land
[19:44] that been taken down there jeremiah
[19:46] prophesied of them that they were going
[19:48] down
[19:49] now daniel oh my
[19:53] he had began to see that the time was
[19:57] getting close
[20:00] just as we are today daniel began to
[20:03] understand he said by the reading of
[20:06] books
[20:09] and in the first year
[20:13] of the reign of daniel and the reign i
[20:16] daniel
[20:16] understood by books the number of
[20:20] years therefore the word of the lord
[20:22] came to jeremiah the prophet
[20:25] that should be accomplished 70
[20:28] years in desolation
[20:31] of jerusalem jeremiah in
[20:36] bc606 prophesied because of their
[20:39] sins and ungodliness that they would be
[20:43] 70 years you remember there was another
[20:46] prophet came up in that day
[20:48] i can't call his name at this time i
[20:50] might be able to catch it for you
[20:52] in a few minutes if i look back for a
[20:54] while but
[20:55] he came up and said jeremiah you are
[20:58] wrong
[21:00] god's only going to keep israel down
[21:02] there for so many days for so many
[21:05] about two years jeremiah said so be it
[21:09] amen he said
[21:12] wait a minute let you and i check up
[21:15] with one another as prophets
[21:18] he said remember there's been those who
[21:20] prophesied before us
[21:23] and they told things that was wrong god
[21:26] dealt with them for telling wrong things
[21:29] so let us be sure what the lord god has
[21:33] told me
[21:33] there are 70 years yet
[21:38] god smoked that false prophet and took
[21:40] his life that same year
[21:42] because god had told this true prophet
[21:45] that there was
[21:46] 70 years and i want you to notice how
[21:49] daniel yet an alien
[21:53] yet ousted from his people ousted from
[21:57] his church
[21:58] without one church service without any
[22:00] church to go to
[22:02] without any hymns to be saying but what
[22:04] he's saying himself
[22:06] in the midst of all this still help
[22:09] on what that prophet
[22:12] [Music]
[22:16] amen amen no church to go to nobody to
[22:20] fellowship with
[22:22] everybody went to heathen temples
[22:24] everybody worship
[22:25] their idols no christian songs
[22:29] nobody's believed the same thing he did
[22:32] and in
[22:33] 68 years from a young man of about 12 14
[22:37] years old
[22:37] when he was taken down there he helped
[22:40] true to god and understood by jeremiah's
[22:44] prophet that the
[22:45] days were almost accomplished amen
[22:49] i would warn the heart of any true
[22:52] prophet of god today hallelujah
[22:54] that we look back and see what this true
[22:58] prophet said
[23:00] and know that we're at the end time
[23:04] he said i understood by books that
[23:08] jeremiah my brother
[23:10] many many years ago prophesied that
[23:13] israel would stay down near 70 years and
[23:17] that time's about fulfilled
[23:21] and he made himself ready and he called
[23:24] a
[23:24] fast and he sanctified himself and went
[23:27] in
[23:28] ashes and sackcloth and put it up on his
[23:31] head and went to fasting and praying
[23:33] to understand about what day they were
[23:35] living in
[23:37] and if daniel the prophet of the lord
[23:40] could consult
[23:41] jeremiah's books and bring him to such a
[23:44] place
[23:46] that even israel coming out
[23:50] all of them alive was coming out of
[23:53] babylon to go back to the homeland
[23:55] which caused him to fast with sackcloth
[23:59] and ashes
[24:00] how much more order to do to the church
[24:02] of the living god to know that
[24:04] time is fading out and shall be no more
[24:07] and the coming of the lord jesus christ
