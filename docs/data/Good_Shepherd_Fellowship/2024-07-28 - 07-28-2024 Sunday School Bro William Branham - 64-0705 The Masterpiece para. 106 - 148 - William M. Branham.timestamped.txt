[0:29] for
[0:36] [Music]
[1:29] doar piled together but they didn't
[1:32] Sparkle even under the light and I said
[1:35] to the superintendent of the minds I
[1:37] said why don't they sparkle he said sir
[1:39] they haven't been cut
[1:42] yet they must be cut then when they are
[1:46] cut then they reflect the
[1:48] light there you
[1:50] are the Masterpiece must be cut
[1:55] notice cut for what is the piece cut off
[1:59] no no the piece is cut off is made of
[2:01] vrola needle and the victrola needle is
[2:05] put upon a a a record that's unseen
[2:09] music to the world but the needle is
[2:12] what brings it
[2:13] out brings out the true interpretation
[2:16] of the
[2:19] word his life match all the peoples it
[2:22] pleased God to Smite him and now why did
[2:26] he Smite him for the same cause he had
[2:28] to Smite Adam
[2:30] now we see him stricken smitten of God
[2:33] and
[2:36] Afflicted the perfect lamb for SL siners
[2:39] slain a perfect Masterpiece now for
[2:43] nearly 2,000 years God has been again
[2:47] making him a
[2:50] masterpiece because he struck
[2:53] Adam to get a a piece off of him part of
[2:57] him a rib to make a wife for him and now
[3:01] that perfect Masterpiece that he struck
[3:04] at
[3:04] Calvary he got a piece off of
[3:09] him it's just the New Testament that's
[3:11] all he fulfilled the Old Testament now
[3:14] it's a new testament another piece to be
[3:15] fulfilled see the new and old is husband
[3:18] and
[3:21] wife and it taken the new to for the old
[3:24] to fores show the new Christ come the
[3:26] Masterpiece to fulfill that now his
[3:28] bride will fulfill everything it's in
[3:29] the New Testament another masterpieces
[3:32] in making as it taken him 4,000 years to
[3:37] make this
[3:38] masterpiece now he's been for nearly
[3:40] 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a
[3:45] bride for Christ another
[3:48] Masterpiece and so doing it he does it
[3:51] by his never changing method the same
[3:54] way he made the
[3:55] Masterpiece amen his word
[4:00] that's the way he makes his masterpieces
[4:02] because it can only be a perfect
[4:04] Masterpiece when it's a perfect
[4:06] word any dirt trash injections it'll
[4:10] break but the heavens and earth will
[4:12] pass away but that word will never
[4:15] break remember cutting a diamond you
[4:18] have to have a perfect tool to do it
[4:20] with not just any piece will do it I've
[4:22] seen tons of them big Grinders crash
[4:25] right through it and move them big tons
[4:27] over pass that diamond right on through
[4:30] oh you don't break the diamond has to be
[4:33] cut now he's doing the same thing and he
[4:36] never changing method we find out in
[4:38] Malachi 3 he said I'm God and I change
[4:41] not he cannot change his
[4:44] method now as he started in Abraham
[4:48] after the follow of the first
[4:49] Masterpiece he started in Abraham on the
[4:51] foundation to build another Masterpiece
[4:54] he started on the day of
[4:57] Pentecost to build another
[5:00] Masterpiece The Original Seed
[5:03] word start in the first church what was
[5:07] it the seed word the word manifested the
[5:11] promise that had been given Joel said it
[5:14] shall come to pass the last day sayth
[5:16] God I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[5:18] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[5:20] your old man shall dream dreams your
[5:22] young man shall see Visions what he
[5:23] would do in the last days to last 2,000
[5:26] years
[5:28] notice and it's started out as the
[5:31] original as Jesus said the word of God
[5:34] is a seed that is sore
[5:36] sold and he was the
[5:39] soar the seed was the
[5:42] word and notice any seed that abides
[5:46] alone never does nothing it's got to
[5:48] fall into the ground to bring forth its
[5:52] production again and this seed that
[5:56] perfect Church fell to the ground
[6:00] at nasia Rome when she become a
[6:04] denomination now historians
[6:08] remember and you go to hear this tape
[6:11] check it up and find out that's not
[6:13] right the church died at n a Rome when
[6:18] she took dogmas and Creeds instead of
[6:21] the original word what was it God had
[6:24] showed by that first church that he was
[6:29] God
[6:32] God he had a church
[6:35] perfected but the church like all other
[6:38] seeds must fall into the ground and
[6:41] die now it fell into the ground and die
[6:45] and wasted away you know I read a book
[6:47] here not long ago someone wrote a a book
[6:50] and said the silent
[6:52] God you might have read it I forget I I
[6:55] think brumbach no I don't I'm not sure
[6:58] who it was wrote it but I can't remember
[7:00] I got it in my study the silent
[7:04] God said God to Thousand Years of Dark
[7:09] Ages set still and never moved a
[7:13] hand and watch faithful Martyrs go to
[7:17] the Lion's pit and be burnt by the
[7:22] Romans assassination of all
[7:25] kinds women stripped of their clothes
[7:29] Set Fire to the WR hair with tar and
[7:32] burn them remember short hair first
[7:35] began in
[7:36] Rome and the women of Christians had
[7:38] long hair so they they dipped it in tar
[7:41] and set them a fire and burn them and
[7:44] them
[7:46] naked B him to the
[7:48] lines and this writer goes to say where
[7:52] is that
[7:53] God oh the blindness of man sometimes do
[7:58] you not know that that seed had to
[8:02] die he never tried to deliver
[8:06] them they went down in
[8:08] Victory they went down bleeding and
[8:11] dying giving their lives why it was the
[8:13] seed that had to fall into the ground
[8:16] first John 12 tells us the corn of
[8:18] wheat it's got to fall into the ground
[8:21] and there die not only die but
[8:24] rot but little did that denomination
[8:27] know that that life was still in there
[8:30] oh the church in itself that n see a
[8:33] counsil of 15 days of bloody politician
[8:37] debate when them Aristocrats come in and
[8:39] want to inject these big dignitaries
[8:42] into the church and Prophets come out of
[8:45] that werness there eating herbs and
[8:47] wrapped in animal skins Janu and
[8:51] Prophets and they throw them
[8:55] out why the seeds got to fall into the
[8:58] ground
[9:00] it's got to die it died in the Dark Ages
[9:03] down beneath the dark
[9:07] dirt they thought it was
[9:09] gone you know St John 12:24 Jesus said
[9:14] except the corn of wheat falls into the
[9:16] ground it abides alone and the first
[9:19] church was that reproduction that
[9:23] bride that seed that word made
[9:27] manifest that fell into the ground at I
[9:30] see a
[9:30] Rome L Church throughout the Nations
[9:35] that'll hear
[9:36] this there is your dirt as them
[9:41] denominations there's where the
[9:45] word was
[9:47] crucified and they accepted
[9:52] dogma and for hundreds and hundreds of
[9:56] years of Dark Ages the power in
[9:59] manifestation of the word was hid from
[10:02] the world only Catholicism
[10:06] ruled we all know that as reading
[10:09] history only Catholicism
[10:13] rule but you you can't hide a gerti
[10:18] seed it's got to come
[10:21] forth because why the great sculpture is
[10:25] on the
[10:27] jobah go to build
[10:30] again so he the seed went down the
[10:35] word when we see Saint Paul Peter James
[10:40] John all those who wrote the word and
[10:43] the road they word they wrote become
[10:45] alive and
[10:48] lived and it
[10:50] lived and when we find after it begin to
[10:54] get
[10:55] ripe John began to write in Epistles he
[10:58] was thr on the aisle of
[10:59] after being burnt in AAL for 24
[11:02] hours but the word must come forth has
[11:06] got to be wrote they couldn't borrow the
[11:09] holy ghost out of him with all so he
[11:11] come forth his work wasn't finished he
[11:14] died on not natural death
[11:16] poar which was a disciple of John
[11:20] carried the word
[11:23] on and from poar came irenius and
[11:27] irenius the great uh
[11:29] man of God who believe the very same
[11:32] gospel that we believe the word is right
[11:36] the church trying to squeeze it out
[11:37] finally come to n Rome and there she
[11:41] fell into the ground after St Martin and
[11:43] was
[11:45] murdered St Martin believed the same
[11:48] thing we believe he stood the same thing
[11:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[11:52] baptism in water in Jesus name he stood
[11:54] in the very same thing that we do and he
[11:56] was a prophet
[11:59] Believe the full word of God and finally
[12:01] they were crucified and mashed into the
[12:04] ground and laid there for hundreds of
[12:07] years and until it rotted the outside
[12:11] seed the bodies just rotted away I've
[12:14] been in San Angelo and the catacombs and
[12:16] see where they died and there broken
[12:18] bones and everything they finally rotted
[12:20] till their bones were
[12:21] gone but the life was still
[12:24] there the corn of wheat that fell into
[12:27] the ground on at the Nia count so begin
[12:29] to sprout again in Martin
[12:31] Luther like any corn coming up or wheat
[12:35] at the seeds Rock the life Springs
[12:39] forth and it begin to bring forth and
[12:41] Martin Luther what did he do the first
[12:43] thing reject the denomination of
[12:46] Catholicism right protested that it was
[12:49] wrong where he said the just shall live
[12:52] by
[12:53] faith Lord what was it a little weak
[12:56] life it put up a couple little shoots
[12:58] that was Luthers it sure don't look like
[13:00] the green that went in the ground but
[13:02] the life is coming out
[13:04] now then it went on to a
[13:07] stock then what happened in the days of
[13:10] John Wesley what did he do when he
[13:13] brought out sanctification he stayed
[13:15] with the word and what did he do the
[13:18] Lutheran had organized and made an
[13:21] organization so it was time for
[13:24] something to happen the Masterpiece is
[13:27] being built now
[13:29] what did he do what did he do he
[13:32] protested that angle in
[13:35] church came out in the Reformation as a
[13:40] tossel what is it the seeds coming to
[13:43] life growing now now the stock doesn't
[13:46] look like the seed neither does the
[13:49] tossel now Pentecostal Brethren
[13:52] throughout the Nations I want you to
[13:55] listen my brother if this is the last
[13:57] message I'll ever preach
[13:59] this is my
[14:02] masterpiece do you notice when the
[14:05] Wheats the corn of wheat that falls into
[14:07] the ground when it begins to farm back
[14:10] to its its grain
[14:13] again what's
[14:15] nature nature exactly is God God working
[14:19] in nature it's all it can but from the
[14:22] Pentecostal Revival as they think was
[14:25] the seed it wasn't now watch but
[14:28] something come forth just like the
[14:31] seed watch what Jesus said in St Matthew
[14:35] 24:24 that the two Spirits at the last
[14:38] days would be so close together it would
[14:41] deceive the elected if
[14:44] possible now that stalk don't look
[14:46] nothing like a seed neither does a
[14:48] tossel look like a
[14:50] seed but notice now not in Luther's day
[14:53] but in the last
[14:56] day the first thing there sweet farmers
[14:59] stting here the first thing that comes
[15:01] forth on a wheat
[15:03] seed you would almost think it was a
[15:06] seed but what is it it's the
[15:10] husk it forms a little outside thing
[15:15] like to hold the
[15:17] seed it forms a husk but the husk is not
[15:21] the seed no more than the tosser of the
[15:24] stalk
[15:26] was it's only a carrier
[15:29] of the
[15:31] life the corn of wheat then of St John
[15:34] 12 you see Jesus speaking the wheat
[15:38] after the tossel after uh Wesley puts
[15:43] forth the
[15:44] husk which is the foremost like the
[15:49] grain of anything
[15:51] else the husk is more like the green
[15:54] it's coming more like the grain all time
[15:55] the one that went in the ground
[15:59] and when it comes forth the stock it's
[16:01] got life in it but it sure isn't the
[16:03] grain comes forth the tossel the pollen
[16:06] it still isn't the Grain and then it
[16:09] comes forth the husk and it's just in
[16:13] the shape of the
[16:15] wheat just exactly like the grain of
[16:18] wheat but yet it isn't the
[16:27] wheat just exactly in the same
[16:30] shape perfectly the Pentecost is come
[16:34] out just like the wheat
[16:35] would each one comes out from the other
[16:38] coming out from the other but they're
[16:40] only a carrier they go to denomination
[16:44] and that's what Pentecost did went to
[16:46] the
[16:49] denomination and what did Pentecost will
[16:51] do when it come out just like the graen
[16:54] it went right back like in Revelation 17
[16:56] to one of the sister Den
[17:00] ations that's exactly what that's what
[17:02] Jesus said now what the gospel is going
[17:04] to come out through Luther through
[17:05] Wesley into Pentecost and the last days
[17:07] they'll receive the very
[17:09] elected if it's
[17:12] possible the
[17:14] elected oh Pentecostal Brethren can't
[17:18] you
[17:21] see the wheat in his first beginning is
[17:24] just like the seed when it begins to
[17:26] form like the seed but it's a husk it's
[17:29] denominated exactly done the same thing
[17:31] they did down here in
[17:34] Luther in Revelation 17 it proves the
[17:36] same thing of churches now the Green
[17:41] Seed in the original fell at Nia or it
[17:45] was the first
[17:48] denomination notice here the life that
[17:52] was in the stock tossled all now ends up
[17:56] in the seed
[17:59] the life that come out of the original
[18:01] seed come up through different
[18:04] processes three different processes and
[18:07] then turns back till its original
[18:13] condition
[18:15] hallelujah
[18:17] oh happiest person in the world that God
[18:21] has let me see
[18:23] this watch how perfect the word and
[18:26] these nature works together
[18:29] just like we Prov the resurrection rise
[18:31] the sun setting of the sun rising again
[18:33] the leaf going out of the tree down in
[18:35] the sap into the root and comes back up
[18:36] and and the leaf comes back up with it
[18:38] again it falls on the ground the life of
[18:40] the tree sucks it right back to calcium
[18:42] and poish and brings it right up to
[18:43] another Leaf again see all nature
[18:45] everything works right with with the
[18:47] word of God and here it is exactly
[18:50] perfectly in these Church ages that's
[18:51] the reason the Holy Ghost came down and
[18:53] draw those things and made them out for
[18:55] us the way he has it's exactly notice
[18:58] share the life that was in the husk in
[19:01] the stalk and in the tossel in the husk
[19:05] all gathers in the seed and the life
[19:08] that was in the stalk went one went to
[19:12] make the
[19:13] other justification made a way for
[19:17] sanctification sanctification made a way
[19:20] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[19:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[19:25] the Holy Ghost itself to come right down
[19:27] in Perfection back to the word again to
[19:29] manifest
[19:33] itself but what denominated
[19:36] dies like life and Luther went to make
[19:41] Wesley and and from Wesley it went to
[19:44] Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the
[19:47] original seed on to Pentecost comes out
[19:50] of the Wesley until that time the reason
[19:54] that Pentecost come out of Wesley
[19:55] because it was no denomination Pentecost
[19:58] was then Pentecost went to denominate
[20:00] and what did it do it turned to the husk
[20:03] it looked like the real
[20:05] thing and anybody how many ever seen a
[20:08] SE seed of wheat start to grow what's
[20:10] the first little thing it's just exact
[20:12] like the seed but it's a husk see the
[20:16] three stages
[20:17] stalk tsel or the pollen then the husk
[20:22] and then out of the husk Comes The
[20:24] Original
[20:26] Seed not a seed it was the life of the
[20:29] seed growing through
[20:30] this to come to the
[20:36] seed do you see it what is it a
[20:40] Resurrection coming back to a
[20:42] masterpiece again like the one that went
[20:45] inj Pentecost came out of the Wesley
[20:48] because Wesley was an organization
[20:50] Pentecost come out as no organization
[20:52] then turned to one it had to to make the
[20:57] husk the True Word of Life on it was on
[21:01] its way then to the original grain
[21:04] through these stages through the stalk
[21:09] then into the pollen from the pollen
[21:11] into the husk and from the husk it made
[21:13] seed no stalk tossel hus
[21:18] living they produced in their early
[21:21] Revival a holder of a certain
[21:26] potion of the seed line
[21:29] but when they
[21:30] organized the life moved out of
[21:35] it that's prove all
[21:38] history never an organization ever done
[21:40] a thing after organized it was
[21:43] dead that's right watch the life's
[21:46] traveling on now it's moving on notice
[21:51] what they have done all these have done
[21:53] As proved by history just exactly the
[21:56] way the church has come never to to be
[21:59] useful to him
[22:01] again organization is laid on the Shelf
[22:04] there never has been in all the history
[22:07] or church after it organized but what it
[22:11] died and the organization died and never
[22:15] did raise
[22:17] again can't you see it man who are blind
[22:21] open your eyes nature and the word
[22:25] coordinating together and proving it
[22:27] right here that this this is the
[22:31] truth that it is the truth that life
[22:35] leaves a stalk to make the tossle from
[22:37] the tossle it makes the husk and from
[22:39] the husk it goes into the
[22:42] original
[22:44] again notice never again to be useful to
[22:47] him how noticeable this life is in its
[22:52] travel in the corn of wheat than it is
[22:55] in the
[22:56] tree God called his people like a tree
[23:00] see the life goes down in a tree and
[23:04] comes back up again goes down and comes
[23:07] back up see it goes down and comes back
[23:10] up but in the corn of wheat it goes up
[23:14] from the original stalk to the
[23:17] stalk castle and husk and the thing that
[23:21] had passed through die so it can't get
[23:24] back to it again what is it it's no use
[23:28] anymore
[23:29] it goes on to its
[23:31] Perfection amen don't you see why he
[23:35] never used an organization he can't get
[23:37] back in it again it's dead but the life
[23:41] passes on from one to the
[23:44] other
[23:46] Hallelujah see they put Creeds in inject
[23:49] whosoever shall add one word or take one
[23:51] word out see he's blocked off from it it
[23:55] must be the life seed traveling
[23:57] on I'm using this in a parable now of
[24:00] the Bride the Masterpiece is coming
[24:02] forth as a masterpiece fell there's a
[24:05] masterpiece Rising the Masterpiece fell
[24:08] at pent I I see a Rome a ni after I I
[24:11] see a Rome she's come through a process
[24:13] but she's coming right back again that
[24:15] Masterpiece
[24:17] perfected because she's a part of that
[24:20] word that was spoken by him he'll have a
[24:23] church without spotter wrinkle Lord
[24:25] it'll not be connected anyway with any
[24:28] kind of an organization or denomination
[24:30] the cursed thing it's passed through
[24:32] those things but it'll never be there
[24:35] notice the seed is coming up not life is
[24:39] coming up not going back there will be
[24:41] no more Resurrection after this am the
[24:44] life is coming up to go to his
[24:47] Perfection a resurrection notice the
[24:50] husk put forth the uh the notice the
[24:54] husk puts the uh uh Original Seed out of
[24:59] itself in Revelations the thir chapter
[25:03] we find this now remember no other
[25:07] church was he put out
[25:10] of in the Bible of the seven Church ages
[25:14] how many remembers it he passed through
[25:17] the church age to go on to make
[25:19] something
[25:21] else but this is it there's nothing else
[25:25] but the the sculpture
[25:28] has got back to Perfection
[25:31] again the
[25:34] word see don't go back how different it
[25:38] is
[25:40] yes oh and notice then the husk when he
[25:44] comes forth looks just like the green
[25:47] but when the green
[25:49] life begins to leave the husk to go into
[25:53] make the green the
[25:56] bride the husb opens up and
