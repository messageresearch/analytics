[37:23] matter of fact he had finished preaching
[37:26] when i got there
[37:29] [Music]
[37:30] and he was just recapping what he had
[37:33] already preached
[37:35] so pretty much i didn't get
[37:37] to hear
[37:39] what he said but i just got a few
[37:42] just a few
[37:44] and right there and then
[37:46] i said this is what i have been looking
[37:48] for praise be to god
[37:52] and that evangelist
[37:55] happened to be brother team
[37:57] praise be to god
[38:01] and
[38:02] there is a special relationship between
[38:04] us
[38:05] and oftentimes you will hear us calling
[38:07] paper pay
[38:10] i may be older than him
[38:13] [Music]

[38:18] means a lot to us
[38:20] praise be to god

[38:25] um
[38:26] our journey how we got to christ

[38:32] from one to the other
[38:35] but is god doing the calling

[47:15] amen
[47:16] so let's read again from the book of
[47:19] matthew just say
[47:21] so if you verse matthew chapter 14
[47:26] and matthew chapter 14.
[47:32] let's read from verse 26
[47:36] of 25 let's take 25 and in the fourth
[47:40] watch of the night
[47:42] jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[47:47] and when the disciples saw him
[47:50] walking on the sea
[47:52] they were troubled
[47:54] saying it is a spirit
[47:57] and they cried out for fear
[48:00] and straightway
[48:02] jesus spoke unto them say
[48:05] be of good here
[48:07] it is i
[48:08] be not afraid
[48:11] amen
[48:13] may the lord bless the reading of his
[48:15] word shall we please be seated
[48:20] god bless you
[48:22] brothers and sisters
[48:23] young old mothers and fathers husbands

[48:29] so just for this little time that we
[48:31] have
[48:32] i
[48:33] want to speak on be not afraid
[48:38] be
[48:39] not afraid
[48:43] praise the lord
[48:46] the prophet of god said
[48:48] god does not want his children to fear
[48:55] god does not want his children to fear
[49:00] but
[49:01] god wants his children to believe
[49:06] god does not want us to fear
[49:11] so
[49:12] god does not want you to fear
[49:17] say to yourself god does not want me to
[49:20] fear me
[49:23] but he wants me to believe
[49:26] yes
[49:28] because
[49:31] there is no virtue in fear
[49:36] god does not want us to fear because
[49:39] fear torments
[49:44] and as it is said
[49:46] the things
[49:48] that you fear are the things that comes
[49:50] to you
[49:54] so he doesn't want you
[49:57] any of his children to fear
[50:00] that's why in all the spirits everywhere
[50:04] he says
[50:05] don't fear amen
[50:08] in the scripture that we read god
[50:10] speaking to the children of israel
[50:13] and telling them
[50:16] what as he was giving them the land
[50:19] of canaan or the promised land
[50:22] he mentioned to them and you told them
[50:24] the land which i am giving to you
[50:27] to possess there are people there
[50:31] the other kinds
[50:32] that invite
[50:34] the
[50:35] devil sides or gigantics and different
[50:38] people are they but i am giving it to
[50:41] you
[50:44] go ye
[50:45] and possess the land
[50:49] and here he was also telling them
[50:52] if that was in the heart these nations
[50:56] are more than i
[50:58] how can i dispossess them
[51:02] they are more than us
[51:06] he also spoke to them in detroit chapter
[51:08] 20 telling them again here
[51:11] when that goes
[51:13] out to battle
[51:15] against an enemies
[51:17] and seers us
[51:20] and tarots
[51:22] and a people
[51:23] more than thou
[51:25] be not afraid of them
[51:28] for the lord thy god
[51:30] his wife thee
[51:32] which brought thee up out of the land of
[51:36] egypt
[51:39] when you see assists and chariots and
[51:41] people
[51:43] that are more than that that's a
[51:44] situation you come into a situation you
[51:47] are overwhelmed
[51:50] a situation that you don't know what to
[51:52] do
[51:54] you are in crisis you are look he said
[51:57] you see horses and terrorists that are
[52:00] more than doubt
[52:05] somewhere in the scripture god was
[52:06] speaking to me he said i'm not giving
[52:08] you this love because you are so many
[52:10] say you are the fewest
[52:13] you are the fewest
[52:16] and the nations that you go to meet they
[52:18] are stronger
[52:20] they are mighty
[52:22] they are powerful but thank god that our
[52:24] strength is of jehovah
[52:26] [Music]
[52:28] jehovah is our strength
[52:30] and jehovah is our god and the bible
[52:33] says blessed is the nation who has the
[52:35] over as your god
[52:38] so if you have jehovah as your god you
[52:40] are blessed
[52:41] [Music]
[52:43] jehovah says
[52:45] don't be afraid no matter the situation
[52:52] brother brian said
[52:54] there are two there are two elements
[52:56] that controls
[52:59] everything in this life
[53:02] and those two elements are
[53:05] one is fear and one is faith
[53:08] amen
[53:11] as we are here he said
[53:14] we are controlled by one of those
[53:16] elements of forces
[53:19] or powers
[53:24] so which of these powers
[53:27] which of these forces
[53:29] dominates our life
[53:33] because the way we list
[53:36] shows what is dominating your life
[53:40] your conversation
[53:43] your way of life
[53:46] it shows what is dominating your life
[53:48] [Music]
[53:51] so which of these forces at this hour is
[53:55] dominating your life is it fear
[53:58] or
[54:00] faith
[54:04] amen
[54:06] there is
[54:08] the scripture tells us
[54:10] there is a fear of god
[54:13] and with the fear of god is the
[54:14] beginning of wisdom
[54:17] and that is reverence
[54:19] you reference god and because we
[54:22] reference god we obey his word that's
[54:25] right
[54:27] you reverence you believe god
[54:29] and if you believe god you fear god
[54:32] you reference him
[54:34] you see if you don't believe in
[54:35] something you will not fear it
[54:40] you will not fear it
[54:42] but if you believe so we are told to
[54:45] have the fear of god
[54:47] and when we have the fear of god will be
[54:49] reverence we will obey his word that is
[54:52] the fear of god
[54:54] and you want to please the lord you want
[54:56] to do his will you want to save him
[54:59] hallelujah
[55:01] he said but we are taught not to fear
[55:03] the enemy that's what jesus said in the
[55:06] ghostbusters look fear not little flock
[55:11] don't see a little frog
[55:14] little frog israel was a little flock
[55:17] god said there are nations kingdoms
[55:20] mightier bigger than that but don't fear
[55:23] them
[55:24] he said when they come to critical they
[55:27] remember
[55:32] amen remember
[55:35] how
[55:36] the lord brought you out of it he said
[55:39] that shall not be afraid of them
[55:43] if thou shalt say in thy heart
[55:46] these nations are more than i
[55:48] how can i dispose them
[55:51] they are more than us
[55:53] they are stronger than us
[55:55] they have this more than us they have
[55:57] that more than us how can we dispose
[56:00] them then he said
[56:02] thou shalt not be afraid of them but
[56:05] shall we remember
[56:08] but shall we remember what the lord thy
[56:11] god did unto pharaoh
[56:14] and enjoyed it
[56:17] when you look around you see them and
[56:19] they are mighting their power
[56:21] they say how can we dispose them
[56:24] god said go to the land possess the land
[56:28] possess it and you say how can we
[56:29] process how can we get them off the
[56:32] place
[56:33] he said then you shall remember what the
[56:35] lord your god did
[56:38] oh that god will help us to remember
[56:41] where you have come from
[56:43] where you have come from
[56:46] what he has brought you from
[56:48] hallelujah what he has done for you what
[56:51] he did for you years ago or days gone by
[56:55] a month goes by and what he has brought
[56:58] he said that shall we remember
[57:01] god don't want his children to forget
[57:04] when he does anything for them
[57:06] amen
[57:08] he don't want you to remember forget it
[57:11] you always want us to remember
[57:14] he wants you to remember so remember
[57:17] what he has done for you
[57:20] remember what he has done for you
[57:23] don't forget
[57:27] don't forget
[57:28] because we easily forget
[57:31] and because we easily forget we
[57:33] complains
[57:35] we manage because we easily forget
[57:45] god said
[57:47] when you are confronted with a situation
[57:50] you say how can we dispose these people
[57:53] he said you shall well remember
[57:59] what i did in egypt
[58:01] to pharaoh
[58:03] and to egypt
[58:05] remember the pharaoh that was one ruling
[58:08] your life
[58:09] remember the pharaoh that was one ruling
[58:12] your life the power that was one
[58:14] controlling you we were under the power
[58:17] of pharaoh the devil set and controlling
[58:20] us we had no choice we were beating left
[58:23] and right it's a dash our way remember
[58:30] somebody say lord help me not to forget
[58:33] help me to say that's
[58:37] yes what the lord thy god did unto
[58:40] pharaoh
[58:42] and to all and unto all egypt
[58:48] it was a super power at that time
[58:51] egypt was the greatest nation at that
[58:53] time
[58:54] it was so powerful like america is today
[58:57] or russia is today
[58:59] and you talk about god's people that
[59:01] have been enslaving for 2 thousand uh
[59:04] four hundred years
[59:05] and they were tormented and they were
[59:07] afflicted and how are they going out
[59:10] but god said
[59:12] they will go out
[59:15] whether the egyptians like it or not
[59:19] whether they were prepared or not
[59:22] god was prepared
[59:24] and so it is today god is prepared
[59:28] he is prepared to have a church a
[59:30] groundless check a chat with that spot
[59:33] and with that wrinkle he is prepared to
[59:35] save and to save to the utter mode he is
[59:38] prepared to deliver whether satan like
[59:40] it or not god is prepared to deliver and
[59:43] that is what you are here for
[59:46] [Music]
[59:47] it was not satan's choice to leave you
[59:50] it was god's decision
[59:52] it was forced upon him
[59:54] let my people go
[59:58] [Applause]
[1:00:01] hallelujah
[1:00:03] it was not pharaoh's toys
[1:00:06] philly was not ready to let them go

[1:12:36] stand before you all the days of your
[1:12:38] life
[1:12:39] no man
[1:12:41] but he has to fight
[1:12:43] you remember him meeting the angel the
[1:12:44] captain of the host
[1:12:47] that was standing there as a man with a
[1:12:50] sword not just him i was holding shot
[1:12:54] this man hold his sword begin to maybe

[1:13:38] are you doing what's your mission here
[1:13:40] are you for us
[1:13:45] if he was not brave he would not have
[1:13:46] gone forward
[1:13:48] he would not have faced the opposition
[1:13:50] he would not have faced the enemy he
[1:13:51] would have run out where he would say
[1:13:53] that's a man with a soul there look at
[1:13:54] the man standing there we thought not
[1:13:56] joshua he knew what god has said god

[1:19:29] john the baptist
[1:19:31] they cut off his head
[1:19:34] that was the prophet jesus of all that
[1:19:36] were born of women there's no greater
[1:19:38] than he was buried without his head
[1:19:42] because a prostitute was requesting for
[1:19:44] that a prostitute requested for the head
[1:19:46] of john the baptist you think his
[1:19:48] disciples didn't pray jesus himself was
[1:19:50] on the scene when they killed john the
[1:19:52] baptist
[1:19:56] was jesus not there the disciples of
[1:19:58] john they wanted to jesus
[1:20:00] what has happened
[1:20:03] yes
[1:20:05] when he was arrested he knew
[1:20:10] he could have prevented it
[1:20:13] but his mission
[1:20:14] was fulfilled
[1:20:18] you should remember
[1:20:20] when pharaoh
[1:20:22] or aaron sent
[1:20:24] to kill the babies
[1:20:26] from two years to one year i mean to a
[1:20:28] baby down john the baptist was there
[1:20:32] when the wise man came
[1:20:34] to jerusalem why is he that is broken of
[1:20:36] the jews
[1:20:37] and
[1:20:39] pharaoh told the watchmen you go and
[1:20:41] look for him when you finally come back
[1:20:43] bring me away my sister will go and
[1:20:45] worship him or what he's lying
[1:20:49] going worshiping

[1:21:01] may god help us
[1:21:04] may the lord help us
[1:21:07] straighten our thoughts
[1:21:09] give us good thoughts
[1:21:11] our thoughts must be the word of the
[1:21:12] lord
[1:21:15] because your thoughts becomes action
[1:21:21] when a wise man didn't come back what
[1:21:24] should this people have to see me
[1:21:30] and a sudden and they may calculate she
[1:21:32] said from that time they came it's about
[1:21:33] two years now all right you go
[1:21:37] kill off from two years to the one that
[1:21:39] was born right there john the baptist
[1:21:42] was there and he didn't kill him
[1:21:47] but god protected him
[1:21:50] the god that protected him continued to
[1:21:53] protect him protected him until his
[1:21:55] mission was accomplished
[1:21:57] and god will protect you
[1:21:59] and god will watch you and god will
[1:22:01] guide you and god will be with you until
[1:22:04] your mission has been accomplished
[1:22:06] and when he's finished with us we finish
[1:22:08] with this life
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:12] somebody say praise the lord
[1:22:14] hallelujah
[1:22:17] the bible said
[1:22:20] james
[1:22:22] one of the elders in the church was
[1:22:24] killed by phil errod
[1:22:27] after james was killed
[1:22:29] the people were happy so aaron went
[1:22:32] ahead and took pity
[1:22:34] and he wanted to keep it
[1:22:36] and peter was sleeping in the midst of
[1:22:38] two soldiers
[1:22:40] one here one day with chains
[1:22:43] and the question is when james was
[1:22:45] arrested
[1:22:48] didn't the disciples prayed
[1:22:52] huh you think they didn't pray
[1:22:55] they prayed
[1:22:57] they prayed and prayed and prayed
[1:23:00] and he said it was cut off i mean they
[1:23:02] killed him
[1:23:05] was it because he didn't have faith no
[1:23:09] the master has a plan and the master has
[1:23:11] a purpose
[1:23:13] when peter was arrested the same
[1:23:15] believers prayed
[1:23:17] and when they prayed god came on the
[1:23:19] scene
[1:23:20] and remember
[1:23:22] when god said no it's as good as yes
[1:23:26] when you pray and god said no that is
[1:23:29] answer and you should be happy with the
[1:23:31] nose just as
[1:23:32] yes because god knows it's as yes
[1:23:36] because that is perfect will
[1:23:39] that's what he wants to be done
[1:23:42] the bible says at midnight the angel of
[1:23:44] the lord descended he went right to the
[1:23:46] prison nobody was guiding him he knows
[1:23:49] where he was
[1:23:52] nobody
[1:23:53] is here those people were afraid
[1:23:56] but the injured the people might not
[1:23:58] even know where they they place pity
[1:24:01] and if they know what would they have
[1:24:02] done because it was in the inner cell
[1:24:07] where maybe they keep hurting criminals
[1:24:09] can you imagine that
[1:24:11] sleeping in the midst of two soldiers
[1:24:14] why
[1:24:15] are there a fish a man
[1:24:19] with that sword without nothing
[1:24:25] the angel of the lord descended right to
[1:24:27] the prison
[1:24:28] he knew where he was and he knows where
[1:24:30] you are
[1:24:32] whatever condition whatever state he
[1:24:34] knows hey just be patient
[1:24:38] keep looking up to him keep trusting the
[1:24:39] lord because he he has a plan for your
[1:24:43] life
[1:24:44] and the blood that god has for you
[1:24:46] nothing can change it
[1:24:48] nothing can change it
[1:24:50] no devil no power no demon no sickness
[1:24:54] no matter what we cannot change
[1:25:01] the bible says
[1:25:03] a thousand shall fall at your side ten
[1:25:05] thousand at your right and it shall not
[1:25:06] even come near you
[1:25:10] it does not matter how many people died
[1:25:12] with covet or how many people die with
[1:25:14] this how many people died we had trouble
[1:25:16] how many people died with people are
[1:25:18] dying every day
[1:25:19] but until god has finished with me
[1:25:21] nothing can take me

[1:25:29] there is nothing to fear

[1:31:07] might you do of that so what
[1:31:10] everybody can doubt that i don't care
[1:31:12] until jehovah has finished with me
[1:31:14] nothing can take me out of it
[1:31:16] oh yes
[1:31:18] do you remember in the scripture there
[1:31:20] were believers
[1:31:22] that were true to the lions
[1:31:25] then they went to the lion's den
[1:31:27] the lion could not eat him up
[1:31:29] there were believers that were eaten by
[1:31:31] lions
[1:31:32] is it because they didn't have it no
[1:31:34] they defy the lions
[1:31:36] the bible says some of them they refuse
[1:31:38] deliverance so we are not going to
[1:31:40] compromise
[1:31:42] we are not going to surrender let the
[1:31:44] lion eat us
[1:31:46] we love jesus
[1:31:48] and they stood there and they shamed the
[1:31:50] adversaries
[1:31:52] they put the enemy to shame
[1:31:54] they refused to surrender they refused
[1:31:56] to give up he said for us to live we
[1:31:59] better die
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:04] they were heroes
[1:32:06] of the faith
[1:32:07] there was there were warriors they were
[1:32:09] faith giants like danny
[1:32:13] they were believers i've been to rome
[1:32:16] some of the arenas
[1:32:18] when they they they released lions to
[1:32:20] eat our brothers
[1:32:22] this some of these are nice in
[1:32:25] i rome oh my goodness

[1:32:37] this believer stood there
[1:32:41] we pledge allegiance to the lamb of god
[1:32:44] will be true to the lamb of god they
[1:32:46] refuse to surrender
[1:32:49] they choose to die than to deny christ
[1:32:54] they give their lives
[1:32:56] so that the gospel can read to us
[1:33:00] their testimonies will be inspiration to
[1:33:02] us
[1:33:06] they were not afraid of death
[1:33:09] don't be tormented by death you are
[1:33:11] going to die you are going to die and
[1:33:12] then and then you become
[1:33:15] crazy you lost your mind
[1:33:17] because you are going to die and you are
[1:33:19] feeling sad and the same going to die

[1:33:31] promise
[1:33:32] of the resurrection

[1:33:42] to have a personal relationship with our
[1:33:45] lord jesus christ
[1:33:46] to be born again to be filled with the
[1:33:49] spirit of god
[1:33:50] to live the life of christ that is what
[1:33:53] is important

[1:33:58] and they stood there
[1:34:00] my my my my
[1:34:01] listen not only men women
[1:34:04] boys and girls

[1:34:15] this gospel
[1:34:16] they stood for this gospel
[1:34:18] they were not afraid
[1:34:20] their own lies their life was not dear
[1:34:23] to them what was so important today in

[1:40:16] when i'm going i used to buy because
[1:40:19] it's the water in those area part of the
[1:40:21] countries and i mean it's not good so i
[1:40:23] buy bottled water and i drink and then
[1:40:25] so we kept the the bottles in the
[1:40:27] cutting i'm in the box and then at the
[1:40:29] point in time we came to a place we're
[1:40:31] trying to buy some food yam or something
[1:40:34] and and then the empty bottle just fell
[1:40:36] down
[1:40:37] and the people were struggling to get it
[1:40:40] empty bottles
[1:40:43] empty bottles nothing inside

[1:41:00] give them a bottle of water
[1:41:03] so that they can vote for them and the
[1:41:04] people will take that bottle of water
[1:41:06] and vote

[2:02:48] fear and why we can thank god
[2:02:51] you know we give the analogy of how we
[2:02:53] met people fighting for borrow
[2:02:57] the time i was working with the world
[2:02:58] food program back in liberia
[2:03:00] there was a photographer who went to
[2:03:03] he went to this refugee camp to
[2:03:06] do some snapshots
[2:03:08] and he saw this little child
[2:03:11] crawl into the distribution center for
[2:03:13] food
[2:03:16] the child was so weak
[2:03:18] and there was a vulture a bird that
[2:03:20] always devoured human flesh
[2:03:23] waiting for that baby to die
[2:03:25] so that he can feed on that baby
[2:03:28] that guy saw that scene he went back and
[2:03:30] committed suicide
[2:03:33] so there are times why can't we give
[2:03:36] thanks to god
[2:03:37] for the little things that we have

[2:03:46] but that's the way we find ourselves in
[2:03:48] so let us give thanks for every little
[2:03:50] thing for everything now sometimes when
[2:03:52] i when i go to work and back home i just
[2:03:55] say thank you lord for bringing me back
