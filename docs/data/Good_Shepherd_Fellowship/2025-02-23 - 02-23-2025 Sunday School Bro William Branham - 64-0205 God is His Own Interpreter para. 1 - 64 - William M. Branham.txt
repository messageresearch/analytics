they are looking for something to happen and when the people are thirsting for or something the Deep calling to the Deep there must be a deep to respond to that call yes that's why we're here tonight because it was upon these ministers hearts and the people to call us together to ask you for favors and blessings believing that you will heal the sick and save the lost and will make manifest your word and we pray heavenly father that you'll Grant this to us as we we humbly wait upon you night after night May there be such a a pouring of the Holy Spirit and may every person be blind to anything else around them except God May there be such a great cry Go Out Among the people thirsting for god Till There will come a Revival throughout the country here and every church will be packed full of people Sinners crying out for God to have mercy and and uh Holy Spirit Healing The Sick making the lame to walk and raising up the dead and granting these things that's been promised in thy word come Lord Jesus and fulfill thy promise come to us tonight we believe that you are the same yesterday today and forever that your promises cannot fail both heavens and earth will fail but your word will not fail May our understanding be old open May the Holy Spirit come and lay the F ground May our understanding be open to the spirit and power of God tonight that he might manifest his promised words through us or we ask it in Jesus name amen now tonight you who watch the text let's turn in the Bible to the book of second Peter and begin with the 15th verse just for a way of speaking of the scripture for a few moments moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunningly devices fables when we made known unto you the power and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty I love that I are witnesses not some Fable we are a witness of what we're talking about for he received from God the Father honor and glory and there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy mouth we have also a more sure word of Prophecy or unto you may do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Times by the will of man but holy man of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word now I'm going to take this for a subject God is his own interpreter we are living in a day of confusion we're living in a day that when men and women hardly know what to do everything is it seems to be in a turmoil everything it seems to be there's so many different ways to look that's Satan to do that now God cannot uh judge a people righteously or right unless there be some standard that he has to judge them by and the Bible says that he'll judge all men by Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the word St John the first chapter said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now all we are today is the display of his attributes in God first he was not even God God we just call him the Eternal one he wasn't God because the word word English word god means object of worship and there was nothing to worship him so he was the Eternal one the the main Fountain of all intelligence and in this Fountain of all intelligence there was not a atom molecule or nothing light nowhere star moon nothing else God what we know is God the great spirit that was eternal never did begin never did end he was there and in him was attributes it was attributes to be God then it attributes to be a father attributes to be a son attributes to be a savior attributes to be a Healer all these attributes was in him and now he these things that has unfolded since then are just his attributes being made manifest what I mean attributes was his thoughts and a a word is a thought expressed and then that was in his thinking and when he said let there be and there was let there be and there was and now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking before there even was a world you were in Christ amen and God in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is God himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled seen and and so forth and that's what God is the whole thing then people say the interpretation I was speaking here not long ago in a meeting a man said to me he said brother brandom you have the wrong interpretation you don't interpret that right now we hear you go to Methodist and they say the Baptist don't interpret right the Baptist say the Pentecostals don't the Pentecostal says that the Oneness don't the one that says assemblies don't and each one says the other one don't God is his own interpreter he don't need anybody to interpret for him right he does his own interpreting who is the man that can interpret God God is his own interpreter now Peter speaking here we find out that in the beginning when God said let there be light and there was light that's the interpretation to it when God said anything and it was manifested then that's God's interpretation that his word's right see when he said let there be light that was in his thinking first before there was such a thing as light when he said let there be light light sprung into the skies that's the interpretation nobody has to interpret that for God said so and there it was when God speaks and it's manifested that's the interpretation of his word why can't man see that why don't people see that God makes a promise and God says in in the beginning in Genesis he lotted his word to each age as it come down from the beginning to the end and down through these ages the church world has got all these things all mixed up with traditions and so forth and God always sends on the scene down through the Old Testament and New prophets and the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and how does it do it it manifests the word of God prise God's manifestation that tells whether it's right or wrong nobody has to interpret it the word interprets itself God promised it and there it happens what good does it do to say anything else about it is a sinful man that would try to say when God made a promise and God does it and that interpretation is wrong that's God himself doing his own interpretation interpreting he don't need anybody to interpret him he interprets himself by manifesting what he promised that he would do or if the church could only see that and see the promises that's lotted for each age all other ages God has sent on the scene even down through the seven Church ages and has manifested everything that he promised to do every thing there's not one thing left undone exactly what he said he would do that he did because when God said him back there and Isaiah he said a virgin shall conceive and she did that's right now who who can interpret that God done the interpretation he said a virgin shall conceive and she conceived now what do you ain't nothing can be said about that because God said she would and she did it amen but the church was too blind then to see it see they had their own ey idea of it it was too too different than what they was expecting Peter here was referring back he said God manifested Christ by his word he said this is my beloved Son these Believers were standing there and Christ was the manifestation of God he always manifested Christ by his word because Christ is the wordl he manifest always the Lord when he said in the days of Noah Christ was in Noah do you believe that Noah said it's going to rain there will be a rain the Earth will be destroyed it rained that didn't need any interpretation it rained because God in Noah said it's going to rain he was a prophet Hallelujah and the evidence was that what he said come to pass so you don't need to interpret that some of Might around and say this man don't know what he's talking about but God had always promised that there be one among you who spiritual a prophet and what he says comes to pass then hear it that's right because it's true it must be in accordance with the word and Noah was in accordance with the word when he prophesied it's going to rain and it rained that didn't need any interpretation for that because it did just that Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and she did now that was awful unusual or it was many hundred years later before this virgin conceived it was so unusual until a good man by the name of Joseph her husband being a just man and was not willing to make her a public example that good man in those days how it must have been with Joseph when he was engaged spoused to Mary she was uh espoused in that day to break that was just the same as uh committing adultery and of course to Joseph it seemed like that Mary was trying to use him for a blockade or make him be a shield for her wrong because sure she was found to be a mother not being married only engaged a trick like that would be stoned to death it had to be by the law and Joseph her husband was a just man a very just man he believed God and once you look at him with those lovely big soft eyes and say Joseph Gabriel the archangel visit me and told me that I was going to conceive knowing no man now if Joseph were just to look back in the scripture the prophet said she'd do that prise the Lord it was only God interpreting his own word amen but it was too unusual that's right that's what's the matter in any age the word of God is foreign to people it's too unusual God always does the unusual it's unusual any where God is it's against the systematics of the world because that they've got things the way that they think it should be but God comes in and does the unusual how could this virgin conceive he was honest he sought God about it and then God spoke to him in a dream and said Joseph thou son of David fear not to take in thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit God has overshadowed her this is what's done it Jeff notice how God dealt with Joseph there in a secondary way in the way of a dream now we know these dreams we believe in dreams I Believe In Dreams then God's always dealt with people in dreams but dream is secondarily see it could be right or wrong unless it's interpreted but he didn't need any interpretation it was God himself speaking directly to Joseph because there wasn't a prophet in the land in them days to interpret but there hadn't had a prophet for 400 years so the next best that God cared for the well far of his own son was speak to Joseph through a dream and without interpretation he said the woman is right that Holy thing which is conceived in her as the Son of God Amen didn't need any interpretation God does his own interpret it the honest sincere Hearts men and women that looks upon the the thing is mysterious if you're honest and sincere and but believe God has a way of interpreting it to you first find out if it's a promise if Joseph had just went back got away from the traditions and went back to the Bible and find out Isaiah said she's going to do that and the things that was spoke of in his birth and all about it was spoke by the scriptures by the holy prophets as Peter said and no man has a right to put any private interpretation of that it's just exactly what God Said would take place he was a manifestation of the word of God promised for that day God said it so there it was that settled it Jesus said when he was on earth when they couldn't understand his ministry it was too great too phenomena they couldn't phenomenal rather they couldn't understanding he said search the scriptures yes I hope I'm not deafening you out there blasting into that search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify me praise God they are the ones who tell you who I am yes see God lotted the word that day was to be the manifestation of God God Emmanuel with us his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor PE Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father and his name Shall be Called Emmanuel God With Us God was in David God was in Moses God as God all the way through manifesting himself for that age but this age a virgin shall conceive and she'll bring forth the son and he will be God With Us amen yeah that's what they crucified him for making himself God and also for breaking the Sabbath he was he was God over the Sabbath and he was God and he was not just a ordinary man or an ordinary Prophet yet he was an ordinary man and a prophet but he was the god prophet and he was a fulfilling of the word exactly what God said he would do so which one of you can condemn me of sin search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify me but they Traditions they was living in a glare of another age as I was preaching a few weeks ago living in a glare a glare is a mirage the sun reflecting itself and it's false and any glare of another age is a false reflection yes people always are walking in something that happened years ago the Lutheran are walking in the Lutheran glare Luther's sunlight was fine in his day Wesley was good in his day the Pentecostal was good in it day we're going on up the ladder we're living in another age Hallelujah on right we're going on on we can't keep looking back when we get ourselves settled down in things we think we got it all made we get our Traditions wrapped up and that was all right for that day but we're moving on search the scriptures and see what's promised for today right and we'll know where we're at Hallelujah and we can tell where we're standing Luther you can look in the scripture and see in that in that s age you can see exactly what was promised look what kind of a rider went forth look what went to Mee him exactly the kindness of man Reformation watch Wes and so forth as it come on down into the Pentecostal age and down through that age watch How It's travel look at the scriptures and see where we're at that's the reason Jesus said search the scriptures see where we're at I believe we're at the coming of the Son of God right now I believe we're at the age of the the very hour that he might appear at any time I believe the scriptures declare that that we're in the last hours of the history of this world I can see things as are shaping see this ecumenical council leading all the churches into it into the mark of the beast and see the Roman Empire and what it's doing and all the rest of them see him getting together shutting out the light shutting off the gospel everybody had to belong to it and walk in their lights or you won't walk at all see we're at the end time there's nothing left for us but to hold on to God and believe his word the word is always right and the lady of see a church age that was the only church age of all of them that Christ was put on the outside of the church he was on the outside knocking what's happened this ecumenical counsel is what's going to put him out the Bible said he was be on the outside and he is it shuts off what the word and he is the word he's always been the word and he's still the word tonight amen he is the word the Bible said the word is sharper more powerful than a two- AED sword Hebrews the fourth chapter a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the word was they should have known who he was when Jesus said that in that day watch what he did one day he was standing there at The First beginning of his ministry there was a man came to him name of Simon Simon Peter and when Peter looked upon him and and saw him Jesus said to him your name is Simon and you're the son of Jonas he should have know that Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me and him you must hear and here was a man that had never seen him in his life said your name is Simon and you're the son of Jonas why he's told right then that that could be no more they hadn't had a prophet for hundreds of years and here was the man telling him who he was Hallelujah no wonder he could receive it Philip at that time went uh and found Nathaniel under a tree and brought him back to Jesus Jesus said behold an Israelite in whom there's no gu he said Rabbi when did you ever know me he said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you Hallelujah he said rabbi th the Son of God you're the king of Israel he know that was what it didn't need any interpretation no right Jehovah said that there stood those there who didn't believe it they said this man's beob he's got a he's got some kind of a trick he's pulling he he's a fortune teller or something Jesus looked at him and said while you speak that against the son of man be forgiven you but when the Holy Ghost is come to do the same thing speak against that it'll never be forgiven you in this world or the world to come he was prophesying of our day Hallelujah the day that we should see for he is the same yesterday today and forever amen remember it was Jesus Christ that was in Moses it was Jesus Christ that was in David when David the son of uh David's went up on the mountain a rejected King and wept over Jerusalem that was nothing but Christ in him for about 800 years later the son of David set up over the Mount of Olives and looked down upon Jerusalem and wept and said Jerusalem Jerusalem how often I have hovered you as a Henwood bro but you would not when Joseph was in prison that was Jesus when he was sold for PR near 30 pieces of silver that was Jesus yes when he was uh made pontier man that was Jesus when he set the right hand of pharaoh and when he left everybody a trumpet sound and everybody had to Bow and eat that was Jesus Hallelujah no man could come to Pharaoh only through through Joseph no man can come through God Only by Jesus it was Jesus Hallelujah the word prophesied being fulfilled spoken shadows and types Jesus is here on Earth he did the same thing the prophets did that's why they know that he was God's manifestation of his word it didn't need to be interpreted when Nathaniel saw they he fell down said Thou Art the king of Israel the Son of God the king of Israel we know you no man could do this Nicodemus came but night said the same thing for the Pharisees but you see they were so hooked up in their ecumenical counsel that they could not accept it he expressed what they said said Rabbi we who's we they're counsil we know that thou a teacher come from God calls no man could do these things lest God be with him they recognize it they know it was but they were so hooked into it God in the past 40 years has shooked this nation with the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallu and men and women are still outside of it because they're hooked into a same thing living in a glare of another day yes amen what's the matter everyone wants to be a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran or something see it's a glare they were living in the glare of Moses day what did he say he said they said we're Moses disciples he said if You' known Moses You' known me Moses wrote on me yes right if you known Luther You' know this age if you know Methodist you know this age right but Christ wrote of this age the words is being fulfilled has to be fulfilled in this Agee it doesn't need somebody to interpret it God does his own interpreting Hallelujah God interpretes himself because he's the only one that can interpret it God's promises always vindicates what he said and that's the interpretation now Jesus to save time Jesus said in St John the 14th chapter 12 verse he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also did he say it that's right I don't need any interpreted when somebody does that work that's God certainly he also said in there as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the coming of the son of man Jesus said that did he say it certainly he said it that needs no interpreting they say well that means it meant just exactly what he said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the coming of the son of man what about the days of lot let's go back just for a moment find out what they were doing there were three classes of people in the days of lot believer make believer and unbeliever that's in every crowd the same thing we find out that the sodomites was the unbeliever lot was a make believer Abraham was the believer he was the one the Covenant was confirmed to he was the one that was looking for a promised son he was the one who was expecting it yes amen right I'm not amening myself amen means so be it and that's right Abraham was not in Sodom Abraham was up and out of Sodom he's a type of the spiritual church today lot is a type of the denominational Church down in Sodom yet watch the Bible said that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily why didn't have nerve enough to stand out against it there's a many of good man sitting in a church today looking out and seeing women with shs on and man doing these things and their members going playing golf on Sunday and picnic parties and swimming and things instead of attending church sitting home on Wednesday night watching television instead of attending church come on they feel like saying something about it but the board would cut them out come on what's the matter it's lot again looking out of his window and seeing the sin and afraid to call Sin Sin [Music] [Music] for
