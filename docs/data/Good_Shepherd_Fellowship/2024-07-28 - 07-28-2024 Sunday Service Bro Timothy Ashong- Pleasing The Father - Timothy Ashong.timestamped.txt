[26:18] the service this morning but uh uh the
[26:22] service last night and uh and and the
[26:26] service this morning as a
[26:30] continuation was actually supposed to be
[26:32] our
[26:34] 29th uh Church anniversary services that
[26:38] we should have done last week because of
[26:41] some reason we thought that we would do
[26:43] something different and what we wanted
[26:46] to
[26:47] do uh this week was to put on the
[26:51] Garment of Praise like I said amen for
[26:54] the spirit of heav and we really want to
[26:57] thank the Lord that he came true for us
[27:00] last night amen he came true for us last
[27:03] night praise the Lord you know uh uh
[27:06] he's our presentent help in time of
[27:08] trouble and his strength is made perfect
[27:11] in our weakness praise the Lord and uh
[27:15] uh just like uh brother Liam said uh we
[27:20] got Mee him in
[27:22] teny uh preaching for Brother Bill
[27:25] Young's uh friend of our was there and
[27:30] uh uh so we we ask him if you uh spare
[27:35] some time of his busy schedule to come
[27:37] down and and and minister to us in
[27:40] singing and he he gladly accepted the
[27:43] invitation so we kind of for work it out
[27:46] for this week but uh uh when he came in
[27:50] he told me even before then he text me
[27:53] you know to pray for him he uh he was uh
[27:57] having which of course he told me it was
[27:59] very strange and uh and I just believe
[28:02] that it's the devil that was trying to
[28:05] to stop the weekend amen and he asked
[28:08] that we pray for him so I told him okay
[28:11] and then so when when he got in we were
[28:13] talking a little bit he told me I was
[28:15] almost close to cancer and i' never
[28:18] cancer and uh so we want to thank the
[28:21] Lord that uh uh he was able to make the
[28:24] sacrifice to come praise the Lord and uh
[28:27] so
[28:28] uh we want to greet uh him and his wife
[28:32] sister Lewis praise the Lord amen and uh
[28:36] last night I did a PO job I didn't greet

[29:21] many of them so you they'll keep coming
[29:24] praise the Lord I'm from a very big
[29:27] family I told you right from the
[29:29] beginning and uh many years ago uh uh
[29:33] one of the ministers back from Nigeria
[29:35] contacted me she was moving over to join
[29:37] her husband in
[29:39] Chicago and uh uh so uh we knew our
[29:43] friend there brother Robel Wilson that
[29:45] was the closest person where she could
[29:47] Fellowship so we we REM recommended her
[29:51] to uh to the to the group there and then
[29:54] ever since uh uh she and her children
[29:58] her daughter got married and she she's
[30:01] mov out with her husband but uh uh she
[30:04] and her son fed and even the husband has
[30:07] been very close to us praise the Lord
[30:10] and uh you know it's it's uh it's
[30:13] difficult to pass to people from
[30:14] distance I don't I don't know how other
[30:16] do it I can do it so uh brother Robert
[30:19] Wilson is her pastor but I'm her brother
[30:22] amen amen so she talks to me about
[30:25] everything
[30:28] so good to see you sister f amen I mean
[30:31] uh Sister Rose and uh and brother fi and
[30:35] then uh we have another visitor and he's
[30:39] a special visitor to me and my family
[30:42] there uh brother James James is back
[30:45] there and uh James used to
[30:51] be and uh one time we were we were
[30:54] trying I was trying to get uh uh someone
[30:58] that will that will uh uh
[31:01] teach uh way
[31:03] instrument so uh if you remember uh some
[31:07] years back we have brother uh what is
[31:10] his name brother Ezekiel uh Spanish
[31:13] brother with his boys so uh one of them
[31:16] were learning the saxophone and the
[31:18] other one was I think playing on the
[31:20] trumpet or so so I was looking online to
[31:23] find a teacher that would do wi
[31:26] instrument praise Lord sopone is one of
[31:30] one of my instrument I love the SAS I
[31:32] can play so uh so I I I bought this
[31:36] instrument and then I went online and
[31:38] then I saw an Aver and then I contacted
[31:42] James but just at the time to the family
[31:45] was going through some changes and they
[31:47] had to move back to to Oklahoma the
[31:50] there was now well in all of that and
[31:52] all the things that happened but then we
[31:54] got in contact with uh with James and
[31:57] then he uh literally became a teacher to
[31:59] my children you know and was also uh uh
[32:04] part of the family he was I mean he was
[32:06] just part of the family just enjoyed to
[32:08] see how he and the kids uh were fooled
[32:11] around you know on their birthday and
[32:14] different things they told me that he
[32:16] was coming I never knew it was today so
[32:19] James it's good to have you praise the
[32:21] lord it's good to have you
[32:27] [Applause]
[32:29] so uh with time now being very uh
[32:32] friendly with us as we would like it to
[32:34] be praise the Lord and uh uh uh we
[32:39] that's the reason why we had the change
[32:40] in the order of the service i t that uh
[32:43] because I told Brother that he would do
[32:46] us uh uh some singing uh a few songs
[32:51] Saturday night and if he can do one or
[32:53] two Sunday morning before the preaching
[32:56] and uh so that's why we stay they kept
[32:58] this stage for him so uh we will we will
[33:01] have we have uh our brother come and
[33:04] then uh he will do uh a song uh or two
[33:09] that he will Fe LED and then we will
[33:11] change the order of the service I know
[33:13] brother uh Lawrence told me there were a
[33:16] couple of other species but you are with
[33:19] us praise the Lord so uh we we will ask
[33:23] that you bear with us let's uh let's uh
[33:27] just enjoy our visitors that will be
[33:29] leaving tomorrow Sister Rose go back
[33:31] tomorrow and uh uh the young go back to
[33:34] Tennessee tomorrow so Berlin you are
[33:37] welcome come up God bless you
[33:41] [Applause]
[33:52] [Music]
[34:13] could you
[34:14] imagine receiving a
[34:16] package beautiful wraps and pretty bows
[34:22] and and you open the
[34:25] package there's not anything in it
[34:31] I feel that way at some Churches I've
[34:32] been
[34:34] to but
[34:36] here a beautiful
[34:38] package and the bows were all perfect
[34:40] and I opened it and the joy of the
[34:45] Lord spring from that package and the
[34:49] smiles on people's faces and the
[34:51] wonderful Pastor you have God has
[34:54] blessed me
[34:55] to be here
[34:58] and enjoy this and see
[35:01] the
[35:04] miraculous Brad of Christ that has been
[35:07] molded from nobody knows where only you
[35:11] know where he brought you
[35:12] from but it's such
[35:15] a wonderful
[35:17] thing thank you
[35:22] for there's three things you tell you're
[35:24] getting old your hair turns gray your
[35:27] eyes gets
[35:29] dim and there was something
[35:35] else
[35:39] anyway I think people have more fun than
[35:42] anybody's
[35:45] just I want to laugh and sing and praise
[35:48] the Lord and because I've been born
[35:52] again not to be a old grouch or sit
[35:56] around not smile or not speaking nobody
[35:58] but just manifest what's in me I'm
[36:02] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[36:04] Ghost and he's the same today as he was
[36:07] ever was when he walked the shores of
[36:09] Galilee he's right here the same Jesus
[36:11] Christ this morning when I first came to
[36:13] message I started listening
[36:15] to the messages in here the prophet
[36:18] tells stories and one that got me in
[36:22] years
[36:23] ago talking to hady rod
[36:27] and uh you know her boys were kind of a
[36:30] little mean guys
[36:31] and and hadie had he said the right word
[36:36] and the prophet said just ask anything
[36:38] you
[36:39] want and you can have it and she said
[36:41] the salvation of my sons and they came
[36:44] and gave their heart to God so reading
[36:47] that and think about I wrote a
[36:50] song many years ago a
[36:55] woman named Mary
[37:00] received a
[37:02] visit from an
[37:04] angel of the
[37:08] Lord she said be unto me according to
[37:15] Thy
[37:17] word she said the right
[37:21] thing and the promise was given to her
[37:28] just say the right word what you ask
[37:33] will be
[37:37] given just approach him with the
[37:42] right
[37:46] attitude had he right said that's the
[37:51] truth brother
[37:55] Brandon she said did the right thing her
[37:59] sons received eternal

[1:04:16] read from the gospel of St
[1:04:23] John joh
[1:04:28] let's
[1:04:30] read chapter
[1:04:38] 8 we read verse 28 and
[1:04:44] 29 then said Jesus unto
[1:04:48] them when ye have lifted up the son of
[1:04:54] man then shall ye know that I am
[1:04:58] he and that I do nothing of
[1:05:03] myself but as my father have taught
[1:05:07] me I speak these
[1:05:12] things and he that sent me is with
[1:05:16] me the father have not left me
[1:05:21] alone for I do always those things that
[1:05:26] pleases
[1:05:27] him amen amen let's be seated while I
[1:05:32] read from the book of Hebrews chapter
[1:05:41] 11 Hebrews chapter
[1:05:51] 11 let's read from verse five
[1:05:56] by
[1:05:57] faith Enoch was
[1:06:01] translated that he should not sit
[1:06:04] death and was not
[1:06:07] found
[1:06:09] because God had translated
[1:06:13] him for before his
[1:06:16] translation he had this
[1:06:20] testimony that he pleased
[1:06:23] God but without
[1:06:26] faith it is impossible to please
[1:06:30] him for he that cometh to God must
[1:06:34] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:06:39] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:06:45] Him may the Lord bless the reading of
[1:06:48] his holy word amen amen so this
[1:06:54] morning we greet to
[1:06:56] all in the name of our Lord and our
[1:07:01] Savior Jesus
[1:07:03] Christ Our
[1:07:05] Redeemer and our all in
[1:07:09] all we want to thank God that he has
[1:07:13] given us this opportunity to come back
[1:07:15] to his
[1:07:16] house and we thank the Lord
[1:07:19] for this last night and the son worship
[1:07:23] and I thank God for our our elder
[1:07:27] brother who has committed his
[1:07:31] life to sing the Bride As
[1:07:37] song
[1:07:39] hallelujah it's a wonderful
[1:07:42] thing and I pray that every one of
[1:07:47] us will find our
[1:07:50] place in the body of
[1:07:52] Christ to do that which places the
[1:07:57] father in John chapter
[1:08:00] 6 verse
[1:08:02] 38 Jesus said for I came down from
[1:08:06] heaven not to do my own will but the
[1:08:11] will of F that sent
[1:08:13] me and this is the Father's
[1:08:17] will which have sent
[1:08:20] me that of all which he have given me
[1:08:26] I should lose
[1:08:28] nothing but should raise it up again at
[1:08:33] the last day yes and this is the will of
[1:08:37] him that sent me that everyone we seeth
[1:08:42] the son and believeth on him may have
[1:08:46] everlasting life amen and I will raise
[1:08:50] him
[1:08:51] up at the last day Hallelujah
[1:08:56] so just to read the scripture alone is a
[1:08:59] blessing Hallelujah and we love the
[1:09:03] Lord and we love his
[1:09:06] people hallelujah and uh I just want to
[1:09:11] read this quot here before we
[1:09:13] go the prophet said I was sitting back
[1:09:16] with brother wood just a few moments ago
[1:09:21] and a certain little fellow that's been
[1:09:24] around the church here for a long time
[1:09:27] he's always wanted to find his
[1:09:30] place I believe I could tell him if it's
[1:09:35] just if he did just do it it's
[1:09:41] singing brother Temple you might do one
[1:09:45] thing and
[1:09:47] another but you are good
[1:09:50] singer I sure appreciate that and if you
[1:09:55] just tend Yourself Loose to singing God
[1:10:00] will use you
[1:10:02] amen God bless you and the prophet
[1:10:06] said you know I run over everything else
[1:10:09] but the right thing get in the
[1:10:13] singing there is your
[1:10:15] talent you have to use that
[1:10:20] wonderful so I just read that in
[1:10:24] appreciation of the ministry the gift
[1:10:27] that we just saw demonstrated in the
[1:10:29] life of our other
[1:10:32] brother and every one of us must find
[1:10:36] where our talent
[1:10:39] is and when you find it use it to be a
[1:10:43] blessing to the body of
[1:10:45] Christ I want to thank our
[1:10:49] pastor but I want for giving me another
[1:10:51] opportunity to be here and to Fellowship
[1:10:55] ship with the
[1:10:56] Saints as always said I just love the
[1:10:59] Lord and I love his people and I love to
[1:11:04] encourage the people of God to keep
[1:11:06] pressing on Amen the upward way yes for
[1:11:11] soon and very soon all will be
[1:11:14] over and I just look around and I see
[1:11:18] that we have
[1:11:21] already finished first part of the year
[1:11:25] the seventh month is
[1:11:28] ended and as we
[1:11:31] know every passing day bring brings the
[1:11:36] coming of the Lord
[1:11:38] closer so we are 7 month
[1:11:42] closer to the coming of the Lord because
[1:11:45] seven months has just
[1:11:46] gone and then the question or what I
[1:11:51] have what I thought of and he said uh we
[1:11:54] all can test testify everything that is
[1:11:57] around us testify that something is
[1:12:01] fixing to happen and if the seven the
[1:12:05] coming every passing Day brings the
[1:12:08] coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:10] closer then my question is have you been
[1:12:14] brought
[1:12:15] closer since the year
[1:12:18] began since you have been hearing the
[1:12:21] word since you have been hearing the
[1:12:23] preaching since you you have been
[1:12:25] hearing the songs since you have been
[1:12:28] coming from the coming of the year to
[1:12:30] this hour how closer have we
[1:12:36] been because he's coming nothing will
[1:12:39] hold him but will you be ready and are
[1:12:42] you
[1:12:45] ready every person Day brings is coming
[1:12:50] closer think on these
[1:12:53] things how close closer are you to
[1:12:57] him it's good to come to church but
[1:13:00] coming to church alone is not
[1:13:04] everything there is a reason that we
[1:13:07] come to church not to show ourselves or
[1:13:10] the cloth that we wear which is nice
[1:13:11] you're all beautifully dressed but how
[1:13:15] closer are you to his
[1:13:17] coming all these days and weeks that
[1:13:20] passes by has
[1:13:23] that has has it brought you closer to
[1:13:32] him may the Lord help us amen and this
[1:13:36] morning just to encourage ourselves I
[1:13:38] want us to speak
[1:13:40] on pleasing the
[1:13:43] father and the scripture tells
[1:13:46] us Enoch before his
[1:13:50] translation he had this
[1:13:53] testimony that he
[1:13:55] pleased the
[1:13:57] Lord amen our lord Jesus told us in the
[1:14:02] scriptures I came down from
[1:14:05] heaven not to do my own
[1:14:09] will but the will of him that sent
[1:14:14] me and he said the will of him that sent
[1:14:17] me is that all that he has given to me I
[1:14:22] should lose none of
[1:14:23] them so he knew why he
[1:14:28] came if he did not know why he came he
[1:14:33] could not have paid the price even
[1:14:36] though it was a difficult thing to
[1:14:38] do remember even when he spoke about
[1:14:42] Calvary I'm going to Jerusalem and he
[1:14:45] was speaking to the
[1:14:47] disciples and he was telling his
[1:14:51] disciples what is awaiting him and he
[1:14:54] was was telling them oh I'm going to
[1:14:56] Jerusalem I'm going to be arrested and
[1:14:59] the son of man will be betrayed and all
[1:15:01] of you will leave me and I will have to
[1:15:04] go
[1:15:05] alone and brother Peter Apostle Peter
[1:15:08] told him took in the Bible say and
[1:15:11] rebuke
[1:15:14] Jesus don't say you are going to die we
[1:15:17] love you
[1:15:18] don't and Jesus said get it behind
[1:15:23] me you don't even know the things of God
[1:15:26] you don't know what you are talking
[1:15:30] about so he knew why he came and he did
[1:15:33] not allow his closest disciple or the
[1:15:38] chief among them or the great Apostle
[1:15:43] Peter with all the revelations and the
[1:15:46] claims Jesus because he knew why he was
[1:15:50] born why he came here he did not allow
[1:15:55] anybody no matter how
[1:15:58] close they've been to him no matter how
[1:16:00] much he loved them and he wanted to stay
[1:16:03] with them he said no I must go
[1:16:09] am pleasing the
[1:16:12] father what are we here
[1:16:15] for what have you come here for what
[1:16:19] have I been born for why have you
[1:16:23] believed this message why I we
[1:16:26] here we must know what we are here
[1:16:31] for because you cannot do much until you
[1:16:35] know what you are here for no man will
[1:16:40] progress until he knows the ground on
[1:16:43] which he's
[1:16:45] progressing until you know where you are
[1:16:48] standing that is why Apostle Paul said I
[1:16:52] know whom I have belied
[1:16:54] amen and I am
[1:16:56] persuaded that he is able to keep that
[1:17:01] which I have committed to his
[1:17:04] trust so it is becoming of
[1:17:07] us to know what we are here
[1:17:11] for now as we talk about pleasing the
[1:17:15] Father the scripture also told us or
[1:17:19] speak to us in the book
[1:17:22] of uh Hebrews that we have read
[1:17:26] spoke about Abraham spoke about Noah
[1:17:30] spoke about and spoke about Enoch and
[1:17:32] then and then and then the scripture
[1:17:35] told
[1:17:36] us
[1:17:38] Enoch live on this
[1:17:42] Earth Enoch walk with
[1:17:46] God amen amen and remember a walk is
[1:17:51] Progressive it's not marking time it's
[1:17:53] walking
[1:17:56] and he said he worked with
[1:17:58] God and he was not seen because God took
[1:18:02] him
[1:18:04] away and then he told us by faith he did
[1:18:07] that Faith with his
[1:18:10] Revelation and then that is revelation
[1:18:13] is the will of God made known to you
[1:18:17] right to know the will of God and
[1:18:22] Revelation brother told us it makes a
[1:18:26] difference in everything we do in our
[1:18:30] worship in our services in our callings
[1:18:34] it does makes a
[1:18:36] difference and the prophet taught us it
[1:18:40] made the differ in the garden of aeden
[1:18:43] between Cade and Abel amen let me just
[1:18:47] say something to you I see some people
