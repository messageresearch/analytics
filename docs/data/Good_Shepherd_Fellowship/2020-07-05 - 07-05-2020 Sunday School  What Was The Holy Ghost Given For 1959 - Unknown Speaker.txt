TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] beyond Pentecost Pentecost has settled itself into organizations and started thinking whole lot about organizations we are this and we're that that's just nature you just can't help it its nature they'll do that it's the plan for them to do that but the church has moved on it's gone into greater more powerful it's a restoration of gifts in many Pentecostal people does not believe in divine healing ministry of angels and powers of God many Pentecostals calls these visions that are see the devil many organizations won't even have nothing to do with it in Pentecost see we've moved beyond that just as Methodists called Pentecostal crazy for speaking in tongues just as Lutheran called Methodist crazy for shouting see but it's all a coming forth out of the holy spirit to all the great churches being filled up and chugged full of the great powers of Almighty God until it's got to a place until the very works that Jesus done is manifesting itself right in the church now we're close friends let me stop here just for a minute to get what God put the Holy Ghost in the church for give you another time so it's you'll know back in the Old Testament when a a child a man made himself a home he got his bride that's the first thing then he become a great man like an organization that was good the next thing happened there come a birth into that home that's when the Holy Spirit see another spirit came in which was the son that son he was not in full charge neither was he a heir until he got a certain age and he had to be proved first yes and then they had the law of adoption to you ministers the placing of a so I'm speaking up now then when he come to a place to where he was adopted Jesus gave a beautiful illustration of it on Mount Transfiguration as I said God will never go outside of his laws to do anything if you got an artesian well on this hill blowing water all over the air and on this other hill over here you've got a crop burning up you can stand on this healing hunter Oh water run over here and fill my crop all water get to my crop it'll never do it but if you work according to the laws of gravitation you can water that crop you've got a sick man laying here our sinner Lane you're a man that wants to be right can't give up drinking can't give up smoking can't give up the standing if you just work according to the laws of God that the Holy Spirit come in there then he's no more his own he he will stop that thing because the Holy Spirit takes him over but you've got to work according to the laws of God the rules of God now in the Old Testament when this baby was born they watched if the CIA was behaved behavior then the father being a great business man but this time maybe in his 40s or 50s he didn't have time to teach this baby itself so he got in them days they didn't have public schools as they have now so they got what they called a tutor or razor school teacher and this school teacher was the best he could find so that he'd be truthful and tell the father the truth about it and then when this boy got to a certain age say he was matured if that boy was just a renegade no good didn't care for the father's business all he thought about was flirtin and running with the women's are our drinking our gammon or horse-racing that boy would always be a son but he was never placed in position to have heir to all his father had but if he was a good boy and he was about the father's business and he proved to be the right child then they had a ceremony they took the boy out into the street and put a white robe on him and they study my onyx scaffold so all the city could see they made a feast and a jubilee and the father then had the ceremony of adoption he adopted his own son into his own business and then the Sun was co-equal with his father in other words have been today the son's name on the check was just as good as the daddy's now watch what God did when his son was born he let him go for 30 years testing him climbing then he give him 33 years of hard drive and then at the end of the hard trial when he seen that his son was about the father's business not transfiguration Buckelew he took Peter James and John three witnesses and went up on top of the mountain and there God performed the laws of adoption he they looked up and they seen Jesus and his clothes shined as white as the lightning and there's a cloud over shattered him and a voice come out of the cloud and said this is my beloved son [Music] I'll sit down now and have the water say well he says is Lord truth now the church has come through those schools she married back on a long time ago in become a denomination an organization but you notice the birth produced something else and now it's got to a place to where the Pentecostal church with the new birth has been tested and tried and now it's coming to a place God doesn't deal with the church at just an organization it doesn't deal with the church as a group of people he deals with the church as an individuals each individual in the church and now it's got to attack and it's no secret we all see it when a man proves and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself there is a front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up there in the presence of God and gives him and fills him in sin see now that's the age that we're living in same Holy Spirit that saved the Lutheran's that sanctified the Methodists that baptized the Pentecostals is now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it will be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that will throw the rest them from the grave there will be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is far what is the only ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they lived in one day under that we live in another day when the enemy comes in like a flood all the Spirit of God will raise a standard against it mean we're in a day now back there there wasn't half as smart as today they make an atomic bomb or automobile they didn't have science and things as we have down well and things of mysterious things to try to say man blow together by some dust and so forth and take some analysis and try to prove it to make infidels out of people but now when we need it the Spirit of God raises a standard what it is pouring any spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave or under the altar of God as the scripture says her crying how long how much God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me that's in time God can pour into us his poulos his power his resurrection that when the church in Christ becomes so post together the Christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go into the rapture now we're going to say show each one that just those who are filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that rapture for the rest of the Dead lived not for the space of a thousand years Brian just Holy Spirit filled people was all went in the rapture now God gave the Holy Spirit I got another scripture in John 14:12 that's a very familiar scripture with all the people here at Tabernacle barely barely I say unto you he that believeth on me now don't let that word believeth Conny sets you back in a nominal church say yes I believe sure I believe Jesus Christ is the son of God the devil bleeds the same thing exactly the Bible said he does but the scripture says and John that no man can call Jesus that Christ only by the Holy Ghost you've actually by the scripture let me stop here just a minute for finish reading you are not converted until you've received the Holy Ghost it's right you are believing on - the Holy Spirit is spoke to you and you publicly confessed him the devil has the same thing I believe him to be the Son of God so does the devil but you're walking on towards you when Peter had been called and justified by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and in John 17:17 Jesus sanctified them through the word for the word was the truth and he was the word first Shawn says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us he was the word so he sanctified them he said father speaking to the spirit in him I sanctify them to the world self Elaine his hands upon them ah word is the truth just merely spoke him into existence in the womb of a woman Oh totally impossible for him to be any other way than this word of God to make him manifest uh sanctify them he gave them power against unclean spirits they went out he put their names in the Lamb's Book of Life and he set them out John Matthew 10 and gave them power over unclean spirits cast out evil spirits and do works and so forth and they come back rejoicing said even the devils is subject to us he said don't rejoice because the devils is subject unto you but rejoice because your names in the book and Judas was with them see how close he can come right on up to justification move right on into sanctification but where did he show his light where did he show himself before Pentecost you show these colors what's that spirit will be justice past and justice sanctimonious as it can be until it comes to the Holy Ghost and they'll cut it off right there that's that spirit case you see it moving up there Antichrist and Jesus said they'd be so close together in the last days it would to see the very elected if possible but remember it's just the elected that will see it caused by election aren't you happy that you're one of them aren't you people here tonight no with you something in your heart tugging I want that Holy Spirit I want you Lord in my heart that's because God puts your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he said that no man can come to me said Jesus except my father has drawed him first and all that comes to me I'll give him eternal life what his eternal life the Holy Spirit eternal life take that word and rend in the Greek and it said Zoe Zoe is the Holy Spirit all that the father's giving me will come to me it all it comes to me I'll give him the Holy Ghost and all raising up at the last day I will do it he said no if it ends about it we'll all that comes and I give eternal life you'll have to raise cause you've got eternal line it has to come can't die no more than God can die oh my dear friends from around this country and in this little city if I could only with my human voice place into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would be the most wonderful revelation that you ever had in your life to see what you must do it let me make that clear about you're not converted Peter had been saved he believed on the Lord followed him just told him who he was had him to following he gave him power against unclean spirits and sanctified him but after all of that and become the chief spokesman of the group as the Catholics were going to call it the bishop for the church or the Pope or whatever it was the head man of the church yet jesus said the night of his betrayal lovest thou me Peter and he said Lord you know I love you said feed my sheep he said that three times and Peter said you know I love you I'll go in through the the end and I'll go with you to the death and so forth he said before the clock has crowed three times you before the crows you will have denied me three times he said but Peter I prayed for you [Music] listen that's not all of it I have prayed for you and after you are converted then strengthen her brother after you are converted he'd shouted he had probably danced in the spirit you've done all kinds of things but he hadn't received the Holy Ghost ship after you are converted then strengthen your brethren that's true carry out his plan now let me finish reading John 14:12 now in the fourteenth chapter 12 where Jesus said verily verily I say in you he that believeth and you cannot believe believeth on me you could believe on to him how many understands that say hey man you remember in acts 19 I hate to stop this year but I just have to say it as it comes to me an ax the 19th chapter when this Baptist preacher which was a lawyer and was converted and he was preaching and getting people saved and they had great joy just rejoicing and shouting have any meeting X 18 equivalent priscilla we referred to it last evening and it went to see him and they note he was a great man and he was a student and he was proving by the Bible that Jesus was the son of God only knowing the baptism of John he didn't know the baptism the Holy Ghost yet so he said equivalent Priscilla that husband and wife little tent makers which Paul was a tent maker too and they'd received the Holy Ghost under Paul's teaching they said we got a little brothers coming up here let him talk to us a little bit about it and when Paul came up and heard him preach Tony was a great man he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you have they said we no not there were there be any Holy Ghost he said them - what are the real Greek word there is - how was you baptized they said we have been baptized already by John the Baptist now watch what Paul said Paul said that John barely baptized unto repentance not for remission of sins but unto repentance saying that's what you believe when you accept Christ as your personal Savior you're bleeding on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is not the baptism the Holy Ghost my dear Baptist brethren there is wrong a brother sent me - they said brother Branham or some time ago months ago he said brother Branham abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness it truly said what more can a man do then believe us so that's all a man can do that's all he can do today's believe God but God gave him a seal of circumcision that we went through last night as a sign that he had accepted his faith in Him and today until God you believe unto Him when you accept him as your personal Savior but when God gives you the seal of the Holy Ghost he sealed you to your eternal destination now you Baptist take that and I'll go with you on eternal security yes sir because grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption you are not single by bleeding onto but sealed by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption that seals you when you found favor with God and he sealed you by the Holy Spirit that sold for the Bible said no man can call jesus the christ only by the Holy Ghost you say I believe it because the pastor said so he's right but that doesn't count for you I believe it because the word says so that's right but the reason for you that doesn't count you the only way that you can say that Jesus is the Christ is when the Holy Ghost comes into you and bears record and witnesses itself out he is the son of God that's the only way you know the resurrection from the Holy Ghost bears record when he the Holy Ghost has come he will testify of me show you things to come bring these things I said to your memories you'll never find it in a school thing he will bring these things to your memories now we want to read just a little further in this scripture around st. John 14:12 fairly burly I say you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater which the right translation air is more if you want to look it up greater works than these shall he do because I go to the Father if he went to the Father the Holy Spirit would come is that right another scripture said if I go not away the comforter will not come but if I go away I'll come again and be with you even in yin see it's God with you over you first with you in Christ in you in the Holy Ghost God in you now the works that I do shall you do also not another word but God wants to bring the Holy Ghost in you to continue the same work that he was doing in Christ the work wasn't so needy in the days of Luther that was God's church it wasn't a little bit bored here in the days of Wesley because the world the Bible said would get weaker and wiser and more wicked all the time we're the world's getting more wicked all that we know that one man do things today that a hundred years ago he would've thought they'd been a human being that cruel moral wicked all the time in the wicked shall do wicked here all the time said the scripture more and more so the Holy Spirit has been moving there's just a little breath of it with Luther a little blow of it with Wesley I know deeper boil it with the Pentecost the breath and spirit has become the same she's uniting together bringing forth that same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like he did back there is manifesting the same works that he did back there is being manifested right today the same thing watch what Jesus said barely barely I say unto you the son can do nothing except he sees the father do it first what this father does he shows the son the father dwelleth in me he doeth the works see now notice here's another thing I like to say right here as Jesus said as the father has sent me as I watch as the father sent me so send I you as a father how did the father send the father that sent him come down from heaven and dwelt in he went forth he said I'll always do that which pleases my father see he went about doing the things that the father was showing him to do I do nothing except my father shows me first the God that sent him was on the inside of him and as the father sent me the same way the father sent me so I send you why are you carrying on what the same works the same Jesus said though he that believeth he that has me on the inside of him the Holy Spirit he that believeth that's already witnessed my resurrection know that I'm in iam he that's in me if he abide in me my words abide in you he said I by Jesus but I sure don't blame anybody he Lee that shows he's not there I believe in Jesus don't be the Holy Ghost this day now I can head it back there that shows he isn't there the Holy Spirit will bear Wickard of every word is spoke he's not a liar he's not afraid of nobody in the organization he don't have to take down for nobody he speaks in any stays with it if the high and polluted and educated or as we call it plutocrats if they don't want to receive it God's able of these spoons to rational Abraham he'll take gangsters and bootleggers and everything else and rise up God can do it and he is doing it God able of these stones to rise children somebody's going to do it cause he's God if you abide me and my words and you asked what you will because you're asking his word and his word is live speak it if God said it in your street sense the Holy Ghost bears record that words right and there your brother speak up there it is say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe it watch it not you that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in you he doeth the talking it's not you talking to that mountain it's the father that's in you [Music] earth will pass away snip at my spirit shall honor my word shall not pass away certainly it cannot pass away father now the works that I do God is in his church to continue his works that's why I sent the Holy Ghost now you know that he knowed it wouldn't be it couldn't be done that way so was it by otherwise so he had to send the father sent the son for all the sin of fun son in you and the same works that he did the same very worse now that Jesus did you'll do also the church wouldn't you like to do the works of God Jesus said he if you don't do the works of God believe on me how you believe on him you can't do it you got the Holy Ghost all those no man can say he is the son of God you're saying what somebody else said the Bible said that he's the son of God I believe the Bible all right the Bible says the Son of God I believe the Bible the pastor says he's the son of God I believe the pastor mama says he's the son of God I believe mama my friend says he's a son of God I believe my friend but the only way that I can say is the Son of God is when the Holy Ghost comes in the best record of his self then I know he's the son of God no man can call Jesus Christ only by the Holy Ghost no man speaking by the Spirit of God called Jesus a curse our saying was something that day and something else today that makes him weak and fall free no sir he's the same yesterday today and forever any true spirit will bear record of that all right now he said these works that I do shall you also John 14:12 now the same works all they say the church does a greater work today in what manner he said the works that I do let me say well we got missionaries all over the world that's a greater work but he said the works that I do i do them do them first then talk about missionaries today speaking here sometime ago about a he said Mohammed's dead that's right he's in the grave but someday he arises he said if he rises from the grave the whole world know it in 24 hours he said you people say Jesus have been raised 2,000 years not one third of the people know it yet that's the calls that you spoke from an intellectual view of it you spoke from a standpoint of school or education if this whole great Church of God Mountain Catholic Protestant all other and receive the Holy Ghost this world be laying solid in Christianity there wouldn't be such a thing as communism that would be such a thing as strive for him in the feared meanness or hatred Jesus would be sitting on his throne we'd be walking through the paradises of God with eternal life living forever already resurrected in a new body walking around never to the old never be never be sick never to be hungry walking the joys of the Lord talking with the animals and oh what a day but we've done everything else besides party he said go you know where I preach the gospel what does the gospel not word only but through power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost making the Word of God manifest as the gospel you can't do it now Jesus know that he had to live in his church therefore he know we'd have intellectual schools and you'll never get this in an intellectual school they'll be against it because all they know is some smart man's learning some creed or denomination they want to deliver by so they'll they'll set you up in that and make you a member of that body and brother quote some things to you Alba Creed that would seem like it was just perfect the great Holy Church the mother it's to Romania beat instead of many a pound so has it ever he's been kicked out of everywhere there is nearly and he's still going on just the same answer all they'll try to quote these so Jesus know that there'd be a great intellectual move just like there wasn't his days in Turin washing of pots and pans and wearing of clothes and turnaround collars and everything as it did all these different things that they would do he know they'd do that so he said not just wait a minute I'm going to not leave you comfortless I'm coming again to be with you therefore he said the works that I do you'll do also the purpose of sending the Holy Ghost was for God to continue through a bunch of people to continually manifest God to the world it's exactly not by Creed not by denomination but by the power of his resurrection I'm making his word real by taking his promise and standing on the side of the minority and believing God and what's the Black Stars move back in power of God move in and take over and then that's what he wants that's what the Holy Ghost was sent far that's why purpose he sent it for we know what it is now and that's why he sent it there's for no other blood would sanctify people I couldn't sanctify you and you couldn't sanctify me cause we're both born after sex but Jesus was born without sex that's right so his blood was the Sanctifier and God came down made a body lived in it shed that blood for the sanctifying of this was absolutely expel the guilty insane then to faith believing in that God comes right down into a human body by the sanctifying of that blood but seen Abraham's seed by faith to believe that that blood would come that pure blood that would be a miracle like his blood walked over there after his as good as dead bleed God for 25 years him 75 years old and bleed till he was a hundred and Sarah 65 and bleed till she was 90 and he was one as good as the dead and God said so the people won't be sure to miss it take him up y'all the hill and offer him up first sacrifice he said to the servant you stand here with the mule and wait the Sun and I'll go yonder and worship and the Sun and I shall return Oh is he going to do it Haber Sam said I'll receive him as one from the dead and I know that he that gives me as one from the dead is able to rise up from the dead if I only keep his word he keep his word he's able to raise him up from the dead perfectly speaking of Christ there he is through that blood cell come forth the Holy Ghost that had itself bound up in her body called Jesus that blood sanctified away by faith took all the redeemed are the elected a cop and when you've accepted that in the Holy Spirit's taking a whole the mean inside of you he moves right in God his self to work as well down here that mean boss's crab in this other old so-and-so over here is doing so and so on this old God talk about against it a man filled with the Holy Ghost and a piece of it a man and they took heed they was ignorant and unlearned but they took heed they'd been with Jesus that's what the Holy Ghost come our little fishermen couldn't sign his name but he stood there said who should we believe men are gone BabyBjorn you will still preaching Jesus name you know he had a home over yonder that's right he was a pilgrim and a stranger here he was seeking the city to come what did that hypocrite priest mean to him he was under the domination of a God of heaven raised up his son Christ Jesus fill them with the spirit of the God that made the heavens and earth are you scared of him I'll serve death while when they took the whole Stephens out there said take it back he said you stiff necks uncircumcised the heart and ears you always resist the Holy Ghost like your fathers did saw you they said we all beat you there said you couldn't do it well show you earlier we're not any great big rocks and begin to pound him in the head he looked up said I see the heavens over I see the ladder coming down I see Jesus standing at the right hand of his majesty and the Bible didn't say he died he fell asleep oh I can just see an angel come down pick him up in rocking like a baby he'll mother till he went to sleep sure that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost that's what God sent the Holy Ghost far the Holy Ghost come to give you power I got some more scriptures yours it's men well Holy Ghost coming to give you power I you can find this I'm just too much of a weight and I give you power power in prayer you take a person that's lived a good life but they're always defeated oh I tell you good person well sure I love the Lord brother Brahim always defeated they never get a prayer answer you feel that little woman with the Holy Ghost one watch what takes place once she goes before God she's not defeated she comes only to the tone of God believing she has a right because she's a daughter of God barber take that little man so cowardly the boss kick him over pace that wait a minute here now something changed he's got the Holy Ghost it gives you power your life is full of power it gives you power and speech why am i those people it was frayed
