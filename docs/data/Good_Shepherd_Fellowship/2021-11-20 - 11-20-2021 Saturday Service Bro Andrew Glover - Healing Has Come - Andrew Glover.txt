uh you can come and share that with us tonight as you know i this wednesday i asked prayer for my mom and my mom since last week has been feeling pretty frail and she looks pale she she's getting weak of course she's 90 years old and my sister just kind of called me and the day before and asked prayer from my brothers and sisters in the church um i guess on wednesday night if not mistaken or thursday um i got a text from my sister my uh sister said that she was telling her thank you for everything forgive me and asking forgiveness and that she knew she was ready to go but as she went to bed i supposedly my sister was just saying oh mom you know she got up the next morning and she said she was sent back she said she saw two beans and they were just talking to one another and they said no jesus is sending you back she actually went and she the lord sent her back yesterday i had a conversation with brother juan i called him to tell him about these things and talk to him for a little while well the brother was sharing a testimony that he had from one of you one of his cousins i think there was a lady back that passed away and she came back to life but she came back according to what brother one was telling me once was because she got her hair cut and they send her back well my brother my brother he didn't know when she said that to me i said my goodness you don't know what you're saying brother my goodness i don't know why you're telling me this sunday my mother usually wears a braid and her hair she's always kept her hair down to her waist she asked my sister to cut her hair here's the brother telling me this story my sister cut her hair to the to her shoulders and on and on thursday when she by god's grace she's telling my sister thank you for everything you know it's time for me to go you know i ask forgiveness so you all tell tell your brothers and sisters that it's time for me to go thursday morning she wakes up and she says they sent me back so i believe that god is giving her an opportunity to take the name of jesus i of course i asked my brother and i asked the lord that that she would not cross over the other side without receiving the lord jesus in our heart and that's my desire brothers and sisters that's my desire that she accept him because when she leaves she will meet him over there on the other side so that's my witness just to show you how how god and his grace and his love to give give her a chance to come back to receive him in in her heart so thank you for the opportunity to express this to you thank you for your prayer i admonish your prayers i appreciate every prayer you say not only for my mom but for somebody else so i thank you for that and that's in the name of the lord jesus christ praise the lord amen amen everyone called me and we were talking he was sharing uh you know with uh that testimony of his mom and then uh i just failed to encourage him and and you know and share this and share that with him it actually was my aunt my dad senior sister she remembered that as a child she was a devote catholic lady but from from a child and this this might have happened back in the 1940s 1930s 1940s and as a child back home a lady passed away and then you know it's in the village they don't have much water to keep the body so they prepared dr grave everything and then suddenly the woman walked her back and says i was sent back because i caught my head you know so my aunt from a little child refuse for her hair to be cut she will always say you know when she get older she actually had dementia you know there are times she will not even remember the people behind her but when you ask her that story about her hair she will always tell you i don't want my hair cut because i don't want to be sent back you know so i was just sharing that with brother wong because his mother woke up and said he sent her back i didn't know why they sent her back and i was sharing that with him and he just said oh my goodness oh my goodness i wonder why is he saying oh my goodness he said brother you don't know what you are talking about you know so but we just thank the lord let's stand on our feet tonight amen uh uh we would think uh uh somebody pray for me amen and have me on your mind praise the lord and when we get to the place where a prophet of god will come in this day you know and and tell us uh from the old old testament shadow how the naz revival was kept in the head you know and the prophet will come and and restore all of these things bring the value of the word to us and we sit down we hear these things this they are preached to us you know and we live in an age where uh uh we think that we are smarter you know and we think they are there you know and we want to pull our our dress

have brother thomas cross here with us traveling with us this weekend brother thomas at 10's brother josh bennett's assembly there in north carolina we appreciate him for coming this weekend with us just before we read the word let's just borrow our hearts together for a word of prayer how many of heaven heat up on your heart something you would desire the lord to do for you amen i received a prayer request today for a young lady by the name of lacey i want to say coughl her last name a young lady battling what they believed to be is crohn's disease and someone had sent me a picture of her a few years ago maybe and then just recently and it looks like a totally different person so she really needs a touch from the lord let's just ask the lord to move for her and he's going to move for us this evening we believe that heavenly father yes what is your belief in children have gotten themselves together here in your house this afternoon lord there is one thing we know and that is that your word will never fail it's never failed it will never fail it can ever fail lord as i heard your prophet say today there's one thing you cannot do and that is you cannot fail and i believe tonight lord that we are believers here father you're believing children and lord as we come together tonight father we don't gather to be seen or to be heard the lord we're coming to worship you and to honor you in the power of your resurrection now father we ask you to move in this meeting tonight in a special way oh god lord you see the needs of your children here in this assembly father we've not gathered here for just another meeting lord we've not gathered just to be lord in another weekend of thanksgiving meetings but father we've gathered here to be edified by your word lord to be edified by our gathering together unto yourself in this hour the lord i'm asking you would come in a special way father may you drive out every demon-powered hell of god will you touch the sick father may you save them also baptize with the holy ghost of fire may liberty come into this meeting tonight lord for this young lady you see the need in her body tonight i pray in the name of jesus christ you would reach your hand down to her father when you drop out this disease of god and you restore her health to her father lord and i pray in the power of your resurrection lord may she meet you as a healer oh god now we commend ourselves in the name of our service anoint us of friends tonight and we'll be sure to give you all the praise on the honor and all the glory for to the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers says amen amen god bless you bless you this evening if you have your bibles while you're standing with us we'll invite you to the book of malachi the fourth chapter the book of malachi the fourth chapter we want to look there in the first verse of malachi 4. and then we also want to greet you on behalf of our church and our pastor back home brother sean martin and the saints there at faith tabernacle send their greetings to you and just an honor to to be here with you all the last time we was here we were speaking to you behind the glass so it's good to see that's down i tell you we sure enjoyed being here with you all and we sure thank the lord for bringing us on the other side of this cold today man i believe we're closer to the coming of the lord and we're closer to that devil of covet going back to hell where it come from amen so we thank the lord for that this evening the book of malachi the fourth chapter i want to look here in the first verse malachi 4 and verse 1. the bible here says for behold the day cometh that shall burn is enough and now all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch let me share in verse 2 but unto you that fear my name unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with amen i believe he's got that healing here yes yes shall arise yes in his wings yes and he shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stone amen we also want to look in the book of acts the 10th chapter and the 36th verse if you could possibly turn this monitor down just just a bit and maybe just leave it there would be great the book of acts the 10th chapter and the 36th verse of acts 10. amen i believe healing has come in this generation here in the book of acts the 10th chapter 36th verse peter here is preaching and in the 36th verse he says the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord amen of all amen that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power amen i'm glad to announce to you tonight that the ministry of the holy ghost has returned to the church of the living god how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good notice this and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him and then we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon uh from those scriptures for just a few moments here if the lord would help me i want to speak to you here on a thought if i'm a talent tonight i want to speak to you on the healing has come to the oppressed healing has come to the oppressed i am thankful tonight to know that god is a healer amen i was listening to a take the other day in the message go wake jesus brother says but there is more to the ministry than divine healing seed the sickest body i know of tonight is the so-called body of jesus christ it needs a spiritual healing there is only one bomb that i know that will heal and that's the word he said and that's the sick body that we want to stand up in the strength and the vitamin power of the gospel he said that's why i use much of the time now in trying to strengthen the church amen by the word they may strengthen the church by the word so then we have now found the source of strength that is coming to the church is by the word i find it amazing that we're living in a day and time when the world is full of pressure i believe it's a i believe it's a tape that we all know very well the prophet of god will preach letting off the pressure and i find that in that word pressure i'm not much of an educational person so you forgive me but i find there in the the root word of oppression is a word called press now when you look at the word pressure it means depressed when you look at the word oppression and then the root word of that word oppression is press the root word of the word suppression amen is press the root word of the word depression amen is press now i don't think it's a coincidence that god would send a prophet who would preach a message entitled letting off the pressure he said then i thought what would i speak to this congregation i thought well they're probably trained right in everything no doubt but there is a pressure on the people today and that pressure has no limitation or any denominational lines it has no age line it has no respect to persons it's on the young and the old it's on the good it's on the band it's on everybody it is pressure he said we are living in a neurotic age a nervous tension everybody is racing here and going there and going nowhere amen it's just that kind of age and i know this church would be plagued with it as everywhere is plagued with it he said the tabernacle has played with it everywhere the whole world is plagued amen with pressure it's a day of pressure amen hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait and they'll drive 90 miles an hour then get home for supper and wait two hours till it gets ready amen it's a time that they're rushing and speeding it's a nervous tension the wife will say something a little contrary and you want to file for the temper the husband will say something then you'll pat your foot tell him to get in the other room say well now husband i don't want no words with you go out there and the husband will say why for i'm so nervous see what's the matter amen all this together this tension is building up and then the results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place now think about that and then the only reason the devil is sending pressure is because he knows that you are the bride of jesus christ and he's trying to get you to act out of character of the way the round would act to get you to do something out of character he said do something wrong and act out a place that's right ain't that now watch this this pressure will make the poor act that way yeah it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way you know makes a pretty good act that way it'll make the good act that way because it's tension it's steam it's built up it's got to blow out somewhere so you blow up the bull or he said now we find that it builds up as the day goes on now amen in the morning there's tension but in the afternoon there's more tension than there was in the morning by the evening there's more pressure than there was in the afternoon or the morning and then he said you'll talk to your boss if you're working on speak to him or the kitty will say come here mama amen there you are see it's all building up coming to a head now ain't been how many has hurt the tape letting off the pressure when brother man preaches that message he actually gets the inspiration ain't been from a gun that blew up in his face but he also tells a story about going to the hospital and visiting somebody and he said when he went in there he asked a nurse where is so-and-so and they said we'll go to this room and he went there and they weren't there and said go to this room and he went there and they weren't there and they said amen he said and everybody i was asking was under such pressure that they couldn't even answer the question the brother comes to the pulpit and says everybody is all built up haven't got no time he said and that builds up to a place that breaks up things it causes people to have hard feelings then they snap off and say things they don't mean to save he said now everybody is guilty of it i'm guilty he said you're guilty of it we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise and then there's an excess excess pressure they've been coming up today before i could go any further i might say this i believe it's the enemy coming down we have now discovered the source of pressure amen it's the enemy it's the devil coming down and pressing and we know that the coming of the lord is at hand and the bible said the last days of the devil would go about like a roaring lion if he could get you under pressure hurry running over something then you'll make a decision that you would make if you would sit down and take it over i announced to you that the time we're living in is a time of pressure but it's also an oppressing time the problem of god said we're going through a great oppressing time when theologies and everything of churches has said come join ours and come join ours amen but just as she begins to break dave and then the rushing mighty winds coming down the channel again and then right down into the church like it did at the beginning ain't been at the break of the day for the same holy ghost power is claiming the same gospel the way it was in the beginning it's claimed again here today i'm so glad that we are marching towards zion as the and what church tells me is the devil don't have enough pressure ain't been to stop the march of the church and yet we're not marching for socialism we're not marching for politics we're not marching for america and then we're [Music] amen i know it's a day of pressure it's a day when the devil is trying to put so much pressure upon us ain't been that we just threw up our hands and quit or put so much pressure upon us that we forget who we are ain't that but let me say you've been anointed to stand pressured to live in this age amen and here we are we're not in the fifth age we're not in the third age or even in the fourth age we're in the semi page where this pressure has been building from ephesus all the way to [Music] [Music] [Music] amen i've just recently been studying a little bit on the children of israel and i find it amazing it means that when you study israel in the church you will actually find that there is a parallel between israel the children of israel and the church of the living god now i said like this we didn't know that there was a parallel between israel and the church until a prophet come along and took an entire series called israel and the church in that five-part series he will open it with israel and egypt right then he'll take two parts on israel at the red sea then he comes along and says israel before the brazen serpent and israel at caenis barnea but i love the way he'll close that is he says israel in the homeland now there's a parallel between israel and the church amen if israel had a homeland amendments to you the bride has a homeland and the prophet said god never did deal with israel and then till she come to the homeland and hear me thus saith the lord god will not deal with this church until she comes back to the homeland amend the message of the hour and we've now identified the homeland of the church it's not a denomination it's not a psychology it's not a man's idea the homeland of the church is the message of the god he said it shall be lied about the even time amen it's god's only chosen place to worship he said what's this message come true what is he going to do and in this day it shall be light at the evening time and what to welcome back his children amen to the promised land by the same sign of the pillar of fire that led the children of israel through the wilderness they've been saved and now we've identified and then the parallel between israel and the church will have a holy land something else that you care about israel ain't that israel had an exodus and this bride has got an exodus israel had an exodus and this pride has got an exodus the prophet said the first yes he said in that first nation this what did he do he said he brought them out of the natural land amen to a natural land he said in the second exodus what did he do he brought them from a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the holy ghost he said but now this third exodus he is bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the holy ghost and then right back into the eternal [Music] and listen wave us the same word that declared the first exodus is the same word that declared the second word and may i announce to the devil tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and there ain't enough pressure out of the pits of hell right now i'll tell you what the devil's doing he's doing everything he can to stop this sexiness amen but i want to tell the devil he cannot stop this and then because he didn't start it [Music] [Applause] to his elected ones only to his elected and then you know what else i find amazing is that god placed a seed in israel for an exodus the prophet said the word exodus comes from the word calling out or going out he said now the children i love this the children of israel amen was exodus amen israel was exodus he said see now in order to correctly get the picture and then notice this of the church of the end and type it with today you've got to go back into the seed to bring it into exodus and then before it can have the exodus or bring it to where you can see where the church is and how they settled in egypt and then you'll see how god called them out amen so the focus was not how they got in egypt it was not what happened in egypt it was not the suffering to the egypt amendment the focus of israel amazing to me is god amen actually visited father abraham and gave him a vision and then many years before israel ever went into slavery it's in the book of genesis the 15th chapter and the first verse after these things amen the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying him fear not abram i am thy shield and not exceeding great reward then you drop down to the 12th verse and it says when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo amen a horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto abram amen no other charity than thy seed amen shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for 400 years and also that nation whom they shall serve and then will i judge and afterwards and then shall they come out with great steps and then notice it didn't tell him what was going to happen holy it didn't tell him how long it was going to be there even but there was a promise of inheritance there was a promise that whatever they went in with is what they're coming out with and that they're going to come out with great substance the problem of god said look here ain't been gone for telling way down in his great great great grandchildren that they would so turn in a strange land for 400 years and would be afflicted now notice this it was a designated time exactly how long it would be he meant before israel ever went into egypt amen god already knew when they was coming out and then before israel faced the first past master god already had identified he said like this he had done put limits on the devil yeah so you only got 400 years so what you gonna do you better do in 400 years [Music] it needs to be occupied it means to be busy with it needs to oppress it means to humble it needs to bow down it needs to be downcast it needs to be humiliated it means to weaken oneself in other words the vision told abraham your seed is going to be weakened they're going to be downcast they're going to be humiliated they're going to be bowed down they're going to be busy they're going to be occupied amen but don't worry about that i'm going to bring them out [Music] before there was one taskmaster aiming to oppress or to afflict israel amen there was a vision concern amen in egypt amen let me announce to you that we've got many task masters in laodicea amen one is a task master it is a person who imposes even a harsh hanging or requesting workload on someone now i'm not going to and then i'm trying to lay a foundation if that's okay i'm not going to read to the first four chapters of the book of exodus but if it's okay i do want to preach it to you for a second in the first chapter of exodus we find out that pharaoh orders all the sons to be killed amen what did he say cast them into the river then we find the reason he'd done that is because payroll ain't that the unrighteous was after the righteous seed of thomas which was going to be moses but it said now see what we can do amen is we can type that with jesus he said satan has always amen tried to kill the promised seed that was carrying thomas he said he tried to quarter it and he tried to kill it he said the first time he done it was with abel he said i'll kill abel and i'll get the seed he said now watch he killed abel and god raised himself and he said and he's done that all the way down the top of the baptism and he said when he killed john the baptist amen the devil said i've got him now he said but the problem was he was already at jesus [Music] and it went into moses and it went into enoch and it went in the time the baptist and it went into jesus [Music] is [Music] are you hearing me you're carrying a seed of exodus and then he was trying to kill that seed we leave next to the swarm we find in exodus 2 that moses ain't them the deliverer was born aimed with a predestinated seed in him there was a predestinated seed in moses notice this moses had to receive his own revelation are you hearing me he had to receive his own revelation amen of who he was and what his commission was now where did he receive that revelation we find that he received that revelation of the burning bush do you realize there's a big difference amen and you're receiving a revelation and somebody giving you their revelation hello there's a big difference in you receiving a revelation and you're receiving a revelation amen let me show you the prophet of god said moses his mother told him he was the promised seed she told him he was delivered his father told him we've been praying for you he said brother madam said that they had the revelation moses was delivered and they told moses for revelation and moses received an intellectual revelation from his parents that he was a deliverer and one day he steps out and he sees an egyptians by the hebrew and something raised up in moses and goes over and kills the attention and pharaoh hears about it and pharaoh comes looking for moses and the bible uses these words moses feared and moses fled at the slaying of one attention amen but listen to me church we find after that he went to the burning bush and the problem of god said the pillar of fire amen came down and consumed that bush and he said god's direct quote he said god put some faith in moses from the fire glory after that preaching right there and god took some faith out of the veil of fire and placed it into moses as why and the prophet said to watch moses goes home and saddles up from you and gathers his wife and his baby amen and says we're going down to egypt to take over amen listen the difference in experience will make he met when he when he had intellectual experience he slew one egyptian at the first bit of pressure [Music] [Music] [Music] are moses went from an intellectual experience he went into a revelation the problem of god said moses tried he meant to deliver israel by pickling freelancing he said but god had to give moses amen listen god had to give moses a scriptural sign and then notice this in order to deliver the people by he had to give moses a scriptural sign in order to deliver the people back in other words when moses went to the burning bush there was a voice that spoke to abraham and said your seed was so turned in a strange land and then that voice that spoke to abraham was the same voice that come down in the burning bush and spoke to moses they said the voice came out of abraham amen the voice came out of the burning bush and the voice went into moses in other words when moses left the burning bush he left saying the same thing that abraham heard amen my seat was so turned into this translation after 400 years i will deliver them and the bible says in exodus 2 23 that it came to pass in the process of time and then that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed amen by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of his bondage and god hearing their growing and god remember his covenant with abraham amen with isaac and with jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect amen or acclaiming to them in other words god respects his seed and then watch this now in exodus 3 god actually calls and then moses to deliver his children from the mud pits of egypt the bible says in verse seven that the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of the people which are in egypt and i have heard their cry by the reason they're taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i o god and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them out of the land into a good land and a large lamb amen flown with milk and honey under the place of the canaanites and the hittites from the amorites and the perizzites and the highlights amen and the jebusites in other words the prophet said i have come down amen i'm sending me it was god going in the form of the man is coming to me and i have also seen the oppression where with the egyptians have oppressed them and then moses saw the oppression amen let me say this there was egypt they've been pressing israel pressing the sea pressing they exit the sea and then the watch moses ran down there and delivered them a message and then we're going to leave here we're not going to stay here under the pressure of the task masters under the oppression of these slave drivers we're going to leave here and the bible says israel actually received the man oh god they received the message of moses and it actually caused him to go into a bit of a revival at the word of deliverance in other words moses went down there and they didn't have to work it up ain't been they had to receive what god said are you hearing me anybody want a revival anybody want a refreshing from the presence of god i meet a lot of people by the way and they say we got to work it out we got to pump it up we got to get something going to get it here ain't that let me say this we ain't got to work it out ain't that the only thing you got to do to receive delivers is [Music] on the ohio river [Music] and by receiving what god was sending and ran into them [Music] we're not staying here [Music] have you ever been there and you've ever wondered if god cares let me tell you something god cares about your afflictions the bible said that people believed and when they heard that the lord had visited the children of israel and that he had looked upon their affliction they found their heads and they worshipped amen i don't know if you catch this or not but i'm gonna preach it to you amen they pound their heads to worship when they receive the message yeah exodus 4 31 when the recognition come to their hearts amen that god knows what you're going through he knows the pressure surrender he knows the situations you're facing when they receive that revelation in their heart and it throw them into a worship in other words the message didn't pop them down and then the mass caused them to worship and then the message [Music] they've been shout for years and dancing for years and didn't have a clue what they were shouting out didn't have a clue what they were dancing about amen but now god has sent a word in this show to deliver his sins amen listen friends we are an identified place of worship we are under an identified message we are following the identified star we are marching to the statified player of time the prophet said we noticed that one time god's children were slaves amen down in egypt amen they throw them bread molded rotten whatever it was they had to eat it they ravished their girls they killed their sons anything they would amen was the people to do the people of god that's right even they were slaves and they could not help it amen you know what i find amazing is right after exodus 4 31 you will read exodus 5 when the bible says that the children of israel went unto pharaoh and said we want to go and we want to worship unto god we want to go worship unto god and the bible says that pharaoh looked upon him and said well if you've got time to worship amen then we're not going to bring you strong and make bricks amen now you have to go get your own strong in other words payroll thought this amen if they got time to worship then they got time to work they didn't notice when pharaoh increased their affliction when he increased the oppression amen was what israel was desiring to go sacrifice unto the lord amen pharaoh's motive was this amen oppress them until they cannot worship they may oppress them until they cannot worship you know i read a book one time about slavery back in the 1800s amen how did they tell the slave owners don't let them people work or don't let them worship when they get done working if they got any spare time don't let them worship you know why because they got to read about they got to hear about how them slaves amen would get done with their work and they would have shackles on their hands they would have shackles on their feet but they would get together in a group of multitude and they would begin to worship god amen and history acts and records that when they would begin to worship god that something would happen and the shackles would fall for him the shackles would fall off the shackles let me say this he's still god [Music] [Music] just when you begin to worship he'll break the shackles off thank you jesus are you hearing me break the shackles huh he can still do it because he's god are you hearing me if you hear me say amen her out amen it was this oppress them until they cannot worship do you realize when the pressure come is when israel wanted to go sacrifice unto the lord in other words pharaoh said if they want to go to church on a saturday night hello if they want to go to church on a saturday night amen that if we even let them get in the building we're going to put pressure upon them church amen now let me just preach to you for a second [Music] you can have a good day on monday tuesday and then the wednesday you're going to have hell nerves you know why because the devil knows wednesday night is coming thursday friday saturday they live at about midnight on saturday nights and then the baby will break out with the temperature they want something to break in the house a little feeling will come in the home and get a little something between the husband and the wife and i'll tell you what it is [Music] [Music] here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] are you hearing me because we returned to the homeland the message of the god i find it amazing that you continue the parallel between israel the church and you find that israel was oppressed when it come time to worship and the bible says in john 4 23 but the hour cometh and now he is [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] worship has been restored [Music] [Music] anything about me just tell them andrew brother is dead with formal religion i am done with dead church services i am done with talking about what god used to do [Music] [Music] we got a right to be quiet even but let me announce to you we got a message i was in the meeting and there was some young people got to shout and got to dancing they got to rejoice and run the aisles and after the service and a guy come up he said you know what i think i think that's a bunch of work up i think that's a bunch of nonsense i said well let me tell you what i think it is i think it's a bunch of young people who are recognizing their name [Music] [Music] because the shout out [Music] [Applause] you expect me to believe this message and not shout this message is called the shout out [Applause] it's called the shout out 4 it's the restoration of the true worship the brother said oh my get away from their man-made traditions and get back to true worship get away from traditions and riches amen and things that we've carried over from former generation listen if we're going to leave here victorious it's only going to come to the message i don't think we've got any taskmasters well i'll tell you what we got we got denominational past masters who are trying right now to oppress the true worshipers around this message that are worshiping under the opening of the word for the open book you say with andrew the book come open there's no time for worship we got to get intellectual we got to get real knowledgeable now well let me tell you what revelation 5 says it says amen from the 8th to 14th verse it reveals the time for the lamb to be worshipped right revelation 5 the book comes open it reveals the time for the land to be worshipped both in heaven i'm on church yeah both in heaven and in the earth the worthy lamb the king's redeemer amen from the 8th and the fourteenth first the angels worship him yeah and then the elders worship him yeah they've been living creatures worshipping and then john worshipped him that's right the bible said every creature in heaven and in earth underneath the earth amen heard me which was john saying blessings and glory and power and wisdom and might be he says the worship time has come for the king lamb let me tell you tonight friends amen will be landed when i get to heaven i'll worship amen you're not in heaven right now even they are worshiping let me let me let me put your mind to these okay right now in heaven they are worshipping even they are worshiping right now amen but you're still in a time of space a space of time you're still on the earth ain't been there fulfilling their part of worship and in their heavens amen but man else to you it's time to worship him before the earth oh man i don't know i ain't got nothing to worship before he woke you up this morning [Music] is [Music] [Music] after the message is delivered it's worship time that's right somebody next didn't say it's worship town after the message is delivered it's worship time and i know it's i know it's people getting their minds after the preaching the service is over but in reality the promise in the early church he said after some godly man gave the message they raised up their hands and praised god they loved the after effects of the holy spirit bathing through them that was the early church and then after the message they loved the after effects of the holy ghost in a message who is this direct prophetic instructions he says now amen after the message let's just bow our heads and worship him as we sing to him how many really love him he said raise your hands i really love him oh isn't he wonderful amen his word has gone forth amen it's fallen into the hearts it corrects us it brings us into subjection to his spirit how lovely it is just to worship him then in other words the prophet is saying that the power of worship should be stronger after the word than it was before the world the service should go down amen the service should go up and then from the first song the service may be here and then the next song that goes here and the next song that goes here and the word comes forth and the church goes here and then you're not supposed to stop there after the word has gone forth it's now time to worship we should go higher than we are right now the promising as you go from the church they've been gold worshipping him but people say to the brown amen i can't worship he said people come to church and they just go because it's their duty or because it's a certain minister amen or somebody in the land he said but we really ought to go to church amen to find christ let's go to church notice this let's go to church to worship teal you can expel all your guilt and shame and throw all the world that's glued out of your heart and let christ come in and then god's satisfied portion his spirit is here his spirit wants to move in his church praise the lord his spirit is here his spirit wants to move in his church let's come to church to worship the deal i don't know he didn't say sit there until all the guilt is gone and all the shame is gone and all the gloominess is gone and all the unbelief he said worship until it's gone and then when it's gone there'll be a real worship church his spirit is here his spirit wants to move in his church amen i find it amazing that after israel received the message that pharaoh again increased their oppression he increased their even when they went to worship you know what he used brother he used their daily task to oppress them what they had to get done through the day is what pharaoh used to oppress them the bible says instead of breaking them strong now israel had to go gather the straw which would make them more busy let me just say this and i'll hurry over this real quick because i want to get somewhere amen we are living in a day and time where people are i've got more gadgets technology things to make more time and we've got less time now than we've ever had that's right are you are you hearing them we got washing machines that'll turn themselves on they'll just about load their clothes for you they've got dryers that are just about drying for you are you voting for you ain't we got refrigerators it meant that you've not got to have an education to even turn the thing on are you hearing me all these things the world is increasing to try to bring it more easy even but in reality we're more busy than we've ever been before you know what the word busy means it means having a great deal to do or occupied or concentrating on a particular activity or object of attention how many knows that you spell the word busy b-u-s-y right yeah did i tell you what busy means amen be means being you under s satan's why yoke [Music] being under satan's yoke listen friends it's not that you're backslidden it's not that you're overcome it's not that your serpent seed amen listen israel was still the saint of god when pharaoh increased their daily tasks i'm gonna like this israel's fathers had to go get them strong now whereas before it was brought to him now we're live in a day and time amen where a family can even get by and then the father is going to have two childs sometimes the wife's even got to have a child even because it's the age we're living in but pharaoh knew if we oppress them enough and we afflict them enough amen before long they'll lose sight of what moses told them and they'll be happy in egypt but let me let the devil in hell know there is nothing he can put upon me that will cause me to recount on my confession i'm leaving political pressure on the theme and pressure anything to cause the church of the living god to back home but the message of the hour we are here and we are going nowhere and then i find it amazing that jesus in the ephesian church age actually warns the church of what they call the deeds of the nicolaitis right you know what jesus said he hated the deeds of the nicolaitans the prophet said what does nico mean it means to conquer what does leos mean the laity if the laity were being conquered then it must have been some authority there to do it amen what was it that god hated that was happening in the church what was going on in there now is going on to are you hearing me what was going on then it's now going on today is exactly what the word nicolaitan means the people were being subjected somehow in a way that was absolutely contrary to the word of god and then the people were being oppressed they were being depressed they were being suppressed into a way that was contrary to the word of god amen paul being a prophet taught by the holy ghost baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and said anyone that did anything different from his preaching was accursed then it is time to wake up and see that the church is no longer controlled by the holy ghost but it is controlled by the nicolaitans that's why paul would write i fear after my departing that grievous wolves amen will enter in among you not spirit the flock in other words subjecting you to things that paul didn't teach well can i have some liberty here in other words pulpits and they're going to say you got to follow my opinion other than what reynolds said you're going to follow the way i see it even if it's not the way william called it remember let me tell you there is one young man that's got enough breath in his body amen that i'll stand like they did the days of call and say that's not what paul [Music] [Applause] [Music] and press back against the spirits of the antichrist that's trying to oppress the pride of christ well but then i don't think it really matters i tell you what there's a war in the land right now amen but listen you've not been placed here without a weapon to defend yourself you are not on the defense you were only all things yeah come on church you're not on the defense you're on the offense we're on the defense no we're not at one time we were amen kind of takes some liberty here and preached and you realize that there was a moses and then there was a joshua you realize that in the bible there was a moses and a joshua and you realize william adams even came in the last days where the compound ministry of both moses and elijah in the days of moses and the children of israel was under amen moses they was on the defense you say can you prove it by the bible yes sir i can because the bible says that pharaoh's army ain't then chased them to the red sea they was on the defense they remember when they switched under the offense under joshua's ministry the bible said the enemy ran from them and ran into a war [Music] joshua went down there and said i'll tear the walls down to get to your bunch of devils [Music] is [Music] this is my message [Music] [Music] [Music] yes you do even because paul saw it coming amen i love this brother he warned them about this subtle priesthood now come on it wasn't a coincidence that paul and william brown would use the same word that moses did when he wrote about the serpent the gal and eve what did he say through the septility the serpent was subtle more suddenly than he beats the field when paul wrote about it amen paul when used the word in second corinthians 11 i fear as the serpent begotten through his septimity that your mind should be converted perverted from the simplicity of the gospel that's in christ when will branham come along and identify the same devil oh god he used the same word moses used he used the same word paul used and said it'll be a simple priesthood that will come in and take over with its false doctrines he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit ministry and even right today among us those who claim to be full and free of the spirit there's not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the plot just sits there and tries to absorb it this is a far cry from what paul said that when we all came together all had the leaning of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship amen when we all come together even brother thomas all will be led by the spirit amen all would participate in spiritual worship and the church corporate has never learned this lesson from the scripture or from history every time god gives a visitation of the holy spirit and people get free after a while they find themselves right back into the very thing they came out of oh yes revelation 12 that old had many dollars and those dollars are just like mother they set the word aside they deny the work of the spirit of god and they subjugate the laity and make it impossible for the laity to worship god unless they come to them or through their pattern which is nothing but a blueprint of unbelief to himself there are people amen who read history listen upon god there are people who will read history shrug their shoulders and go back to believe in a lie you realize there's people around this message right now and then they've got books and tapes and they read a prophet saying that the purple has been identified among the church they read it and they go back to their church and some priesthood says the third tool was only for brother adam it's not for you so they believe the truth and go back to believing a lie but come on church we're not going to take an exodus by false doctrines we're not going to take an exodus by man's impressions [Music] shut their shoulders and go back to believing a lie it's not in the word they've been but men put it in their own book and by it took over people even ruling them by fear now amen can i take a little liberty here amen i'm not against quote books amen i thank god for quote books amen but i am against men's quote books [Music] what are you saying i'm saying if you're going to put a quote book together amen put a quote book together and say what william branham said don't hand me what [Music] to subjugate the laity apart from the church let me brother one i hope it's okay all right let me just say this if god said i don't know why i'm going this way but i'm following him if god set you under a pastor there may be other men around the country that you love to hear amen but you cannot judge what your pastor is saying by what another man says oh god help me out that's close to my are you hearing me say what are you saying well brother juan speaks something and i think brother so-and-so has got a better opinion of what he said i want to take brother so and so and i want us to reject brother warren brother juan is the pastor he is following the pillar of fire he is leading he is being led by the spirit of god he is preaching what a prophet already said listen if you're going to correct him correcting by the word [Music] you know what will happen that that will rear his head up in the church and before long the whole church will go from back in the word ain't meant to question the word and then then somebody'll have a little bible study somewhere and they'll get a little uprising against what the pastor said oh god i'm preaching now amen let me say this if you're a part of this exodus the very moment you see that spirit raise its head it will something will raise up in you and the devils [Music] was led by feelings and sensations and emotions and dreams amen but this bride is led by an adoption message things lead her into a state of perfection by the world oh god amen said come back amen to the word amen can i have a few more minutes in a few more minutes the problem of god said the last stage you know what else they're going to do they're going to become lukewarm so they're going to subjugate the laity so the church becomes lukewarm then the church becomes lukewarm it becomes formal you know what it dies by being powerless it goes from lukewarm to being horrible to be in powers and i promise that god hates a powerless religion he realized the prophecy like this he said the baptist and the methodist and the church of christ and the pentecostals have all esteemed their word above god's word until this last stage god says i'm going against all of it i'm going to spew you out of my mouth this is the end for seven out of seven ages i have seen nothing but men esteeming their own word of my mind so at the end of this i'm gonna spew you out of my mouth it's all over i'm going to speak all right yes i am here i am in the midst of the church the amen of god the faithful the true will repeal himself and it will be my prophecy oh glory to god so that moana tell you what i went back the room last night and i got me a message i'm working on now ain't that the fuel of this message is an absolute at the end of the day when it's all said and done that's why we come back to you [Music] or y'all hear me and you know what i heard him say he said a church ought to have the liberty of the holy ghost and i preach the liberty of the holy ghost upon the church of the living god by the word even seek those elect amen will be the ones who will truly manifest the lord and will be his body and his voice and will perform his works the protagonist at lukewarm church amen made god sick and he declared he will spew it out amen you realize tonight friends amen that there are people sitting in message churches who have been subjugated ain't been to the deeds of the nicolaitans their families have went around circles for years maybe some of y'all sitting out here have been to have been under taskmasters and been under rulerships and things that was off the word amen can i announce to you amen the devil that tried to kill you that tried to mortally wound you amen i come tonight to announce to you [Music] [Music] the prophet said the hour is here for you to be healed the hour is here for me to be healed and then the hour is here for you to be healed that's right go over that con and receive the spirit cut off all information cut off and come into the realms of the living god who awakens the human soul and brings you into righteousness into true worship with him in spirit and in truth are you hearing me tonight can i have just a few more minutes look here in acts chapters 10 verse 38 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with what with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing and then all somebody say oh healing all the oppressed of the devil for god was with him do you realize what moses was i don't think it's coincident sister that a prophet of god preaches an entire tape called dr moses and what are you a type of doctor with you connect healing with the doctor in other words moses came into the mud pits of egypt as a spiritual doctor with a message of healing to a wounded people who was afflicted and was oppressed by the task masters of leonism and the bible says that god would send jesus a second time amen and he would heal all that were oppressed of the devil what is that devil the devil is a false accuser the devil is a slanderer he is saint in the prince of demons he is the author of evil even persecuting good men estranging mankind from god and enticing them to sin are you hearing me now afflicting them with disease just by means of demons who take possession of their bodies at his bidding they've been reading this with me now of demons come on preach back at me of demons who take possession of demons who take possession amen i want to say it like this what is healing the prophet said healing is your personal faith in a finished work at calvary that the lord jesus christ did by him at calvary when he purchased your salvation and your healing listen tonight friends the prophet said oh my there is a vast difference in looking at god's word and receiving god's word he said now when you receive the inspiration amen can you preach with me tonight stand back at me when i receive the inspiration he says when you receive the inspiration that jesus christ died for your sickness it's that very hour that your healing has come [Applause] when you receive the inspiration that jesus christ died for your healing it's that very hour you receive your healing your healing has come that's right oh god when you receive from heaven somebody say from heaven when you receive from heaven that jesus died for your sins and you have accepted it you don't need any prayer then you've already accepted it it's settled now we can preach the word but you can explain the word but you've got to receive the word

do you realize the israel was like that they had grounded lips they had stupid shoulders they had they they were weary by the burdens they was under amendment from heaven ain't enrolling through a mystical channel and then god spoke to abraham and what god planned abraham rolled into moses and were rolled into moses he rolled into egypt and began to preach to israel what role into him by the mystic channel and when israel received it it changed them from being the depressed to be in the oppressed to be in the people pressing back are you all hearing me before israel received the message pharaoh could control him but after israel received the message pharaoh was praying they would get out of it [Applause] he was a weak body brother he was the sick people but it didn't make no
