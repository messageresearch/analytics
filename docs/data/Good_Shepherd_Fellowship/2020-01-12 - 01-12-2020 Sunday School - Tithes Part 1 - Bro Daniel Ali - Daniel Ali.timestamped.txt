[0:00] Oh Lord that you have brought us this
[0:03] far when we look at our personal lives
[0:06] and we look at further old God where you
[0:10] have taken us from and how far you have
[0:12] brought us we know that it is nothing
[0:16] but God and we owe you dear Lord Jesus
[0:21] all of our lives or God and we are going
[0:26] to save you come with me what Irina's
[0:28] shine we are going to glorify you
[0:31] further old God in this flesh we just
[0:34] thank you so much that you are the
[0:37] author and the finisher of our faith we
[0:40] worship the father this morning we bless
[0:42] the old God and we uplift your holy name
[0:44] our Lord and our master Jesus we don't
[0:49] want our service to you to be a matter
[0:52] of convenience that we do things because
[0:56] it's in our comfort zone we want to go a
[0:59] step further the even when the odds are
[1:03] against us Lord we shall do it because
[1:05] it pleases you further we are going to
[1:08] look at tithing and we are trusting in
[1:11] your grace or glad to help us because
[1:15] this is an area of opportunity sometimes
[1:19] it becomes a bed in doing this we are
[1:23] supposed to be doing and in it we'll
[1:25] lose our blessing but there is a lot of
[1:28] blessing that comes further or God when
[1:32] we do your will as a specter of you not
[1:36] the way we think about it and further we
[1:38] are trusting in your grace or God that
[1:41] you are going to help us father I be
[1:43] with us during this this this this this
[1:45] teaching and help us to see kids who may
[1:49] have seen but have overlooked that we
[1:52] may look at them again help us father we
[1:55] pretty in Jesus name Amen
[2:23] yes so as I said last week we are going
[2:28] to talk about money not so much about
[2:32] money but goes money praise be to God if
[2:38] I'm going to talk about your money then
[2:42] there is something else but we will talk
[2:45] about goes money it's a little of a very
[2:55] sensitive area and I see a lot of men of
[3:01] God would want who rather not talk about
[3:05] it because if care is not taking there
[3:12] people may think oh maybe he was my
[3:15] morning friendly to see or get into the
[3:21] revelation of what he is trying to say
[3:25] so
[3:27] if I first I came out today to talk
[3:29] about Heights
[3:30] he may not talk about it the way I am
[3:32] going to do it and I'm happy he is not
[3:36] the one talking about it so people may
[3:39] think that oh is because he wants our
[3:41] money praise be to God so we are going
[3:48] to take a before we read what I want to
[3:53] say is that seven God must cost you
[4:01] something and why it doesn't cost you
[4:06] anything then you have to take a second
[4:12] look at your walk with God I am NOT
[4:18] saying that there is something wrong but
[4:22] there may be something wrong there may
[4:25] be something you are not doing right
[4:27] praise be to God so as we are looking at
[4:31] tied in this morning I want us to read
[4:34] if we can open our Bibles to
[4:37] first emoji six first Timothy 6 first
[4:46] Timothy 6 we read 6 to 10 I'm sorry
[4:57] first emoji 16
[5:12] I read for the love of money is the root
[5:16] of all evil which while some coveted
[5:20] after they have erred from the faith and
[5:24] pierced themselves through with many
[5:29] sorrows praise be to God
[5:36] now we are going to zero in on money
[5:40] even though you can pay your tithe in
[5:45] various forms once upon a time I paid my
[5:51] tights in how would I call this let me
[5:58] just go directly to it just land
[6:02] building plots of land that I just
[6:08] looked at what God gave me and I took
[6:10] the tiles out I didn't sell it I just
[6:14] took it land and I've also been in areas
[6:19] where people like tide pain when we look
[6:24] at where he started from when Abraham
[6:28] defeated the enemy he paid estate was
[6:32] the spoils he got from the war it was
[6:37] not money we have also seen where ties
[6:39] are paid in author of animals in food
[6:44] and what a view but in our setting here
[6:48] I don't know how many people pay ties in
[6:53] another form other than cash there may
[6:59] be famous in our midst but maybe they
[7:02] would even sell their produce before
[7:04] they think of paying their tithes
[7:07] so we are just going to zero in on money
[7:11] now just a little foundation
[7:21] the love of money is the root of all
[7:24] evil money is a very dangerous element
[7:33] of life we have to look at and look at
[7:36] it very very very well it's okay to like
[7:45] money that is what we are all waking we
[7:49] go to school we study very hard we look
[7:52] for good jobs why because we want
[7:55] good-paying jobs we want money we like
[7:57] it but it only becomes bad when you
[8:02] don't like it but then you love it then
[8:06] that is where the danger comes in
[8:08] because once it becomes a love affair
[8:13] with money then guess what the bubbles
[8:17] is it is the root of all evil it's very
[8:22] very very easy to be taken on our ways
[8:37] in our Bibles to prove s Terry nine
[8:42] Provost 37 profits
[8:45] Terry seven profits
[9:02] okay seven I read a prophet 379 I think
[9:17] I have something else here okay it's
[9:23] correct two things have I required after
[9:26] of D deny me not before I died
[9:33] remove far from me vanity and lies give
[9:39] me neither poverty nor riches feed me
[9:44] with good convenient with food
[9:48] convenient for me lest I be full and in
[9:52] ID and say who is the Lord or lest I be
[9:57] poor and still and take the name of my
[10:01] God in vain we'll be getting to this
[10:08] very soon I remember when I was in Ghana
[10:11] I worked in the western part of the
[10:13] region for two years I was there and
[10:15] they brought in a guy who killed his own
[10:18] brother over three thousand CFA and when
[10:24] I converted that money around that time
[10:26] it was about five hundred and thirty
[10:29] dollars his own blood brother they went
[10:35] to a village and they wait for three
[10:37] months the money the gut they crossed a
[10:41] stream and when they cross the stream
[10:44] garnishes bother with that country and
[10:46] when they cross the stream the brother
[10:48] went down to just drink from the stream
[10:53] and he hugged his brother to death and
[10:56] then he came to the town looking so
[11:00] distraught and the people saw blood on
[11:02] him and accorded police the police
[11:04] arrested him and they realized that oh
[11:06] he took his own brother's life just
[11:09] because of five hundred and thirty
[11:12] dollars
[11:14] this is why I say money can be really
[11:18] really really dangerous and money is
[11:20] something you have to look at because we
[11:22] are going to talk of money in a little I
[11:24] mean all we are talking about ties has
[11:26] to do with money so that's why I want to
[11:28] build a little foundation here on money
[11:30] praise be to God again people can do the
[11:40] love of money would compel people to do
[11:42] anything for money again in the western
[11:46] region where I worked before people who
[11:49] go through tunnels just for the love of
[11:53] for the sake of money people became rats
[11:56] your thing is only foxes that live in
[11:58] holes human beings to live in holes
[12:01] they're brought through tunnels and the
[12:04] idea for two three four weeks chasing
[12:07] gold and people carry kerosene and food
[12:14] every day in those tunnels to go and
[12:16] sell it to them and come out they don't
[12:18] even know what time of day it is and
[12:20] then they ask you what is today's date
[12:23] what time of day what what what day of
[12:27] the week is it today
[12:28] that is what the love of money can do to
[12:32] people and we have to actually watch our
[12:36] relationship with money money can be a
[12:43] good thing money can be a button it is
[12:46] not how much money you have dhaka make
[12:50] it a button and also it is not how less
[12:57] of it you have Dhaka make it a good
[12:59] thing you can be so rich and the money
[13:09] becomes a problem to you and you can be
[13:15] so poor and a lack of it also becomes a
[13:19] problem to you
[13:23] it is not to say that God does not give
[13:25] his children blessings or bless him with
[13:27] money
[13:28] god bless his children his journey with
[13:29] money and when you see genuine blessing
[13:37] in the form of money in a child of God's
[13:41] life you can identify it you not keep
[13:48] that money it's like when God has given
[13:50] a man a gift that gift is not meant for
[13:56] you it's meant for the church and don't
[14:02] forget that God blesses his true and
[14:06] also with gifts with with with wealth
[14:10] you can have riches and it's a gift from
[14:13] God
[14:14] and your thing Oh is your effort your
[14:19] thing is your education you think it is
[14:21] your sweat so you just keep it to
[14:23] yourself I am NOT saying that when you
[14:27] have it you start by the roadside and
[14:29] then who has a problem and then you dish
[14:32] it out that's not what I'm saying
[14:34] that would be a very reckless way to use
[14:37] God's money
[14:40] remember the way God gives his children
[14:44] gifts and they use it in the house of
[14:47] God they'll use it for the churn of God
[14:49] to prosper the kingdom of God to bless
[14:52] the churn of God their Sam well Berta
[14:54] also bless you with wealth and it's not
[14:58] yours and God opens your eyes to see
[15:06] various needs in the house of God God
[15:12] will open your eyes to see needs in
[15:15] brothers and sisters life needs in the
[15:18] church and what I supposed to do with
[15:23] that money sit on it
[15:24] No
[15:28] it can become a problem it can become a
[15:33] blessing depending on the way you use it
[15:39] so don't think it is just in the first
[15:41] place and you can be so poor that you
[15:49] get yourself involved in things you
[15:52] shouldn't do
[15:53] why because you are so poor and you need
[15:58] money at all costs
[16:00] you need money to pay your rent you need
[16:03] money to pay your bills you need money
[16:05] to pay your car note you need money to
[16:08] put food on the table think about it and
[16:11] then you end up doing things you
[16:13] shouldn't the reason why you see people
[16:16] out there and getting the prostitution
[16:19] is just for that reason
[16:22] there is a why you see people day who
[16:25] still and go into robbery into drugs
[16:32] they want first money first money the
[16:40] love of money can put you in harm's way
[16:48] that was why I read proverbs thirty
[16:56] seven to nine
[17:04] too much of it can create a problem not
[17:08] to have it at all can create a problem
[17:10] and in this life don't work with the
[17:17] intention that oh I am going to get rich
[17:19] I want to get rich wealth is a blessing
[17:27] from God you can work as hard as a
[17:31] donkey and you would never get rich it
[17:34] will only lead you astray dunno whether
[17:39] it's a blessing that comes from God
[17:42] one time I was listening to a story I
[17:44] love listening to Katy yeah I sell Katy
[17:47] is a lot and then they told a story
[17:49] about a guy whose grandmother died and
[17:54] then when they were sharing the the
[17:59] wealth they gave him a blanket now think
[18:05] about it they may have given I didn't
[18:07] get all the story but they may have
[18:09] given somebody maybe 10,000 maybe 20,000
[18:12] there may be 100,000 eh maybe somebody a
[18:15] car and then they gave him a blanket the
[18:19] first thing you would think Oh mind this
[18:21] is an insult
[18:22] oh so she didn't even love me at all
[18:25] when she was her life what am I going to
[18:27] do with a blanket but she took the blank
[18:29] he took the blanket and kept it and
[18:32] according to the story this guy was
[18:35] homeless he was living in a shelter and
[18:40] then he was given is it two hundred and
[18:43] fifty dollars I don't know what it was a
[18:45] week or a month two hundred and fifty
[18:48] dollars and life was very difficult for
[18:52] him and then he moved to somewhere in
[18:56] California and one thing led to another
[18:59] and then he had to sell oxygen the
[19:04] blankets on line and he auctioned the
[19:08] black up for two million dollars a
[19:12] blanket who would buy a blanket for two
[19:15] million dollars
[19:18] what whoa I mean what blanket what sort
[19:22] of blaka would that be and according to
[19:26] the story now he didn't believe it
[19:29] himself I mean nobody will believe the
[19:31] story a blanket two million dollars and
[19:35] the first in according to the story he
[19:37] paid his tide out of it and then part of
[19:42] the money I think he bought a home and
[19:46] then he donated part of the money to
[19:49] charity and he saying he didn't believe
[19:53] the story so God blesses it sure in a
[19:58] very peculiar way you can you would
[20:02] never see it coming
[20:04] you would never see it coming
[20:08] but after God has visited you in that
[20:12] unusual way it blows your mind they so
[20:17] know this must be God just work hard
[20:21] enough to take care of your financial
[20:24] needs to pay the bills but I am just
[20:28] going to make it either by rain or shine
[20:32] I must get rich no never got to that
[20:35] point if we get to that point you are
[20:37] opening yourself up for the devil to
[20:40] take advantage of you praise be to God
[20:43] so we are going to talk about money I
[20:48] want us to take the grid the grid out
[20:55] it's okay to like money as I said from
[20:58] the beginning because once you get
[21:00] greedy you never get satisfied with what
[21:06] you have you can have your your left
[21:13] hand holding maybe a million dollars
[21:16] here because of greed you are going to
[21:19] put your right hand in somebody's pocket
[21:23] to make sure you take the last cent they
[21:27] have on them
[21:29] is what greed can do to a man the Bible
[21:34] says godliness with contentment is a
[21:37] great gain that is first Timothy 6:6 you
[21:41] can read that later
[21:42] our time is running out godliness with
[21:46] contentment is a great game whatever God
[21:49] has given you be happy with it
[21:54] there isn't why some people who not pay
[21:57] their tithe is because of greed it's
[22:02] because they are not satisfied with what
[22:07] they have that which belongs to them the
[22:13] portion of the income or their earnings
[22:17] which is dears because they are not
[22:22] satisfied with it they would want to
[22:24] take the little that belongs to God and
[22:27] add it to what they have
[22:30] that is what greed can do you fail to
[22:35] see how much you have you have the
[22:40] greater part of it but you don't value
[22:43] it you never get satisfied with it you
[22:48] want to get the little that belongs to
[22:50] God you want to take it and add it to
[22:53] what you have that is what great can do
[22:56] and it's not going to help you would I
[23:02] help you when I raise you up at all to
[23:06] bring you down now God expects every
[23:14] child of his to pay tight
[23:21] there is clean money that is also dairy
[23:26] money you get up you go to wait you work
[23:35] so hard you put in your time at the end
[23:40] of the period you are paid it's clean
[23:44] money it is not your sweat it is not
[23:49] your energy it is not your education it
[23:53] is not your smartness is God blessing
[23:58] you the way he has done you may say oh I
[24:02] have good education there are people
[24:05] that have better education than you and
[24:07] yet they have never gotten to that
[24:10] position sometimes we think that when
[24:18] you have a lot of money you enjoy life
[24:21] no it's not true
[24:25] to tell you the truth a lot of the rich
[24:28] men you see all day they have sleepless
[24:30] nights we go to bed in less than ten
[24:35] five minutes we are gone and we're
[24:37] sleeping with sleep very well praise be
[24:40] to God the blessings of God come in
[24:45] various ways so when God has blessed you
[24:51] with genuine wealth you have way very
[24:55] hard clean money you are expected to pay
[24:58] twice from this money but remember also
[25:01] that the devil has a way of also giving
[25:10] people money that is why as a church we
[25:15] don't believe in gambling don't believe
[25:19] in gambling you can win gamble and then
[25:24] you have maybe mention it
[25:29] somebody can well rob the bank
[25:31] somebody can steal as I was saying you
[25:34] can engage in a crooked this business
[25:36] deal and you know what you did was wrong
[25:38] it's contrary to the Word of God now
[25:42] what I want to say here is that if
[25:45] anybody ever engaged in any money-making
[25:49] venture that is contrary contrary to the
[25:54] Word of God God will not even expect
[25:56] ties out of that money because it is
[26:01] contrary to the Word of God if God does
[26:08] not approve of that way of making money
[26:14] God doesn't expect any type from you but
[26:22] archeron of God who are genuinely
[26:25] working so hard who are blessed of God
[26:30] will take our money God expects you to
[26:35] pay tight now I want us to
[26:50] hey I see my time it's writing so let me
[26:58] just take a few things here in the
[27:04] message witnesses 1953 the prayer of God
[27:10] said put God first pay your tithe first
[27:18] pay everything pay God firsts pray fast
[27:26] at morning pray all through the day give
[27:30] God the first place in everything praise
[27:35] be to God in the message the faith once
[27:39] delivered to the Saints he also says
[27:41] it's part of our calling the believer
[27:45] today is a man who goes to church and
[27:50] pays his tight when I cannot try to get
[27:56] I mean it over clothes 200 coats or
[28:01] partitions I could get from the Prophet
[28:03] talking about pay your tithe pay your
[28:05] tithe pay your tithe tight pain is part
[28:13] of our Christian duty never take it
[28:20] lightly as God would grant us grace to
[28:24] look at this topic it will get very
[28:28] interesting as we go on this is just to
[28:31] lay the foundation I have not picked up
[28:35] yet this is just laying the foundation
[28:38] and I chose to go this way because that
[28:41] pain is about taking money not taking
[28:45] money from you it's about you giving out
[28:49] and there are a lot of reasons why
[28:53] people would want to hold on hold on to
[29:00] God's money
[29:03] that is not a good thing to do that is
[29:08] not a good thing to do so my time is up
[29:13] and by the grace of God next week we are
[29:22] going to go into it very well praise be
[29:28] to God shall we pray our Lord and our
[29:39] Savior Jesus we thank you so much for
[29:43] what you have learned today just trying
[29:46] to lay the foundation further for
[29:49] tithing when no father it is not a very
[29:53] popular subject but we have to talk
[29:58] about it because it's part of your word
[29:59] and father we are trusting in your grace
[30:03] Oh God as we go through this since Lord
[30:06] and to open our eyes to see things we
[30:11] may have seen before but have not given
[30:14] regard to them that you open our eyes
[30:18] further to see the blessings that come
[30:22] with paying our tithes now you will help
[30:27] us further just help us in one way or
[30:28] the order in any way it pleases thee we

[31:35] situations when Lazarus was dead and he
