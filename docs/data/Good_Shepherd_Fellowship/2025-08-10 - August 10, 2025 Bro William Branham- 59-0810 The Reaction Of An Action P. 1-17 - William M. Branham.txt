========================================
[Music] and for preparation being made for another campaign. The memories of the last one still linger with me from down in Middletown. But tonight coming out here, I thought I'd never find the way. I just just kept moving and we are anticipating this week for a great spiritual outpouring of God's blessing upon us as we humbly are waiting his coming. And now we have six nights. This is Monday through Saturday and we were on a little rest period at this time the party and I and brother Sullivan uh had sent for me to come up and so we called him up and told him we'd like to come back up and meet some of these fine people again and God has given us this grand privilege. The boys are along, Leo and Jean. They're going to have the books and tapes and so forth, as that's their line of the business to to take care of the customers that wants the books and tapes and so forth. And then we thought we would have some healing services, our prayer for the sick, pray for them. And the Lord willing, we will begin our services of praying for the sick tomorrow night. Uh we usually have to give out some prayer cards to keep the people kind of lined up and in order. And then again, I I wanted to find out if that was kind of in the run of the people's mind. And I always like to come into the meeting and feel first just what the Holy Spirit would have us to say or do. And then we can make announcements. And as I come up on the platform just now with Leo and them, I just looked out and seen these little boy here and these ones in the wheelchair. And I looked around and that feeling come to me that God would have us to pray for the sick. And they uh tomorrow afternoon about what is your regular starting time? &gt;&gt; 7:30. &gt;&gt; 7:30. Well, say by 6:00 or 6:30. Se by 6:30. Anyhow, the boys will give out prayer cards for tomorrow night. We'll start praying for the sick and Lord willing, we'll have six nights or five nights of it. And then we'll be able to get through the entire group of people to pray for all who comes that wants to be prayed for. we'll pray for them. And so we just take our cards and come as we are called. And we are trusting that this will not only be just a, as we call it down in Kentucky, a protractive meeting, but a old-fashioned revival meeting right on these campgrounds here where I understand that many have cottages rented. And I think it would be good for prayer meetings to be going on all day long around here, just everywhere. For you cannot get anything from God until you get close to God. You know, it's written in the scriptures, "Draw nigh unto me and I'll draw nigh unto you." And if we are here now for one sole purpose, that is to draw nigh unto God, let's do that with all that's within us. draw nigh unto God. And I want to say this that God will never hear your prayer as long as you hide iniquity in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will not do it. &gt;&gt; God will. The Bible said over in I believe in first John 3, if our hearts condemn us not, then we have confidence in God. That is if we don't have no condemnation in our heart. I just went through an experience of that a few days ago and I might just stop here to tell you about it. For we never want to be in any hurry. That's what's one of the great ruins of our American heritage today is we're trying to run over the top of everybody. look like we're trying to run over top of God. Not waiting. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. I've been going through some testings at home and and I've been called in to witness some things in a for a trial and they'd call me over and over and over till I was just so tired. I I looked like the the whole world was a polus pulling on top of my head. I come home that morning and the wife said, "Well, how you doing?" I said, "Honey, them things would drive a person out of their mind." And so I just sat down to eat dinner and and the phone rang. We have an answering service and this is the private phone at the parsonage. So just then it rang and she went in, answered it. She put her hand over the phone. She said, "Billy, Sam attorneys again." Oh, I said, "Honey, I I couldn't stand it another afternoon." About six or seven days of it then. I said, "I just couldn't stand it." And I got up from the table and went out the door. I said, "Tell them I'm not in here now." Went around behind the house. I felt real bad. And I come back and my my wife is a whole lot better woman than I am a man. So when she come to the door looking at me, she said, "Was that just exactly right, Billy?" I said, "Sure, I know it wasn't already." But I wanted to make her think that my story would stick. So I said, "Yeah, I wasn't in here just then." She said, "But you were in here when they called." I said, "Oh, it's all right." And I went on out. There was one waiting man with a sick baby. All the way down to pray for that baby. My I just felt awful. Then when I got down there to pray for the baby, something said to me, "Wow, you are a liar. And you mean that you're going to lay your hands upon this baby? This man's come for about 400 miles for you to pray for this sick baby and and you just told a lie and had your wife to tell one. Then our hearts condemn us. You see that was wrong. So I said to the man, I said, "Mister, if you'll just hold your place, I'll pray for your baby, but I'm not worthy to pray for your baby." I said, "Because I've got something to make right before I pray for your baby." &gt;&gt; I said, "I've done something that's wrong and and my heart's condemning me, and I've got to go make it right first." And I tuck out down to the attorney's office and knocked on his door and he comes the door said, "I thought you were gone." I said, "I was only gone around behind the house while you were calling." And I said, "Sir, I tell you what I did." And I explained it to him. I said, "You all had me in such a fix." I said, "I I just didn't know you questioning me this way. Did they do this or did you see this?" And I said, I I told you everything I knew over and over and over. But I said, I told him I went to pray for a sick baby and what happened? And he said, walked got up out of his the seat and walked around behind his desk, looking me right in the eye, put his hand over on my shoulder, reached down, got my other hand. He said, "Brother Brandom, I always had confidence in you, but I got more than ever now." &gt;&gt; That made me feel good. Then I got in my car and went out to my little old cave where I go to pray. And I thought, now if you've got done wrong, go confess your wrong first, then come back to God. So I went out to my little cave and I'd prayed all afternoon. And I told the Lord, I sorry I did that. I I wasn't fit to pray for his people anymore. I couldn't have faith as long as I know I lied. I said, "You forgive me, Lord. I I and give me grace and I I won't do it anymore." I prayed till just long about time the sun was going down. There's a way back in the wilderness and uh a creek runs some three or four city blocks from where it's at down into a a valley. And I walked out. The foliage is heavy on the trees now. I standing on a great big rock after I come out of the cave to always it faces the east. I always go out after I pray for a day or two or hour or two stand on this rock and raise up my hands and praise the Lord. For someday I hope even if I am in the grave that when he comes I'll rise and see him coming from the east. And I stood on this great huge rock and had my hands up praising God. And I after I'd finished praising him, I dropped my hands down. I said, "Lord, one day Moses stood in the cliff of the rock and you passed by." I said, "If you forgive my sin, then you you're going to try me again. just passed by once more, Lord, to let me know that you've forgiven me and that my iniquity is all gone, and I shall go then and pray again for the sick people. You might not want to believe this, but at the judgment bar, you and I have to confess it again. You'll know it was true. There were justice still as it is in here, not no wind, nowhere. And right over to my side, a little whirlwind caught into the bushes. And here it come right along the side of the cave by me and went off down through the woods. I wept like a baby with both hands up in the air. &gt;&gt; If our hearts condemn us not, then we have confidence in God. &gt;&gt; But God will not answer us if there's something we're hiding in our hearts. So let's confess all our sins and wrongs and trust God to pour out his spirit in such a measure that there will be a great spiritual outpouring in this old camp meeting ground here. Whatever it is that sick people will be healed and sinners will be saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll be praying for you and you pray for me and together God will bless us all. And now tonight I had to hurry and get here. We left a little later than we thought we were going to. And so I've chosen for a text found in the book of First Kings, the 17th chapter. and the 14th verse. I shall read it. And if I make a subject, I'd like to call it this. The reaction to an action. How you react on some action that you have taken. For thus saeth the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cru of oral fail until the day that the Lord sends rain upon the earth. It must have been a hot, weary morning. There had been about three years. There was no rain. Not even the dew would fall from the heavens. The land was scorched. No food was raised. And it was a terrible time. Hunger and death stalking the streets. People poverty stricken. No water. It was a reflection of sin and moral decay just like we have today of our age of juvenile problems and divorce problems and all the crime that's done in our nation. It's a reflection of our moral decay. no rain and she must have prayed all night long. Jezebel and her modern crowd had so socialized the religion and brought the whole nation into idolatry. It was the time of Ahab's reign. The most wicked king that Israel ever had for he was just a borderline believer. And that's the most wicked person that there is is a man or a woman that professes Christianity and just got enough of it to make them sick. to make them say, "I'd like to do that, but my religion won't let me do it. I shouldn't do it. That's the most miserable person I can think of." &gt;&gt; If that's all we had, we ought to bury that and go get something better. &gt;&gt; And Ahab had knuckled down to his idoltor wife and had brought all Israel into idolatry. And you'd say then, Brother Brandham, you compared it to today to our nation. Yes, sir. Our nation is greatly covered over with idolatry. &gt;&gt; We might not worship wooden animals and so forth as we want to think of idolatry, but that's not all idolatry consists of. We sometime make our automobiles and our clothes and the things that we do. We put an idols. Anything between you and God is an idol. Sometime we make our churches idols. We should never do that. God is the only one we should worship. The whole nation was governed of course by the rules and regulations of its king and the king had said this was all right. It was modern and all the people wanted to be modern just like we are today. We want to be modern. You could turn on your television and you find some woman smoking a cigarette said be modern use certain certain cigarettes. The next place is drinking beer and say be modern drink so and so. Well, we don't want to be modern. We want to be Christians. &gt;&gt; It's not the modernistic trim that we're trying to keep up with. It's going back to the old healing lines of God's word &gt;&gt; as Christians and living like men and women was supposed to live by the order of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "It's written that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." &gt;&gt; We got to live by the word. But today we want to be modern like they were. And the government endorsed it. So does the government endorse it today. Why? A few years ago, 25 years ago, 50 years, if women walked on the street then dressed like they're dressed now, they'd put them in jail. &gt;&gt; But the government endorses them. and we want to be modern. I'll state this with all respects to our government and our lands. It is a work of the devil. &gt;&gt; It's the devil at work. I'm just believing the oldfashioned unadulterated gospel truth of the Bible. But drinking used to be it wasn't immoral among the people. And now you find little bitty teenage children drunk. Card playing used to be wrong for the Christians. And now millions of so-called Christians have entertainment in their churches playing cards. giving away little cars and so forth, bunko. It's all nothing but plain lottery. And it's wrong and it's degrading to any nation, let alone a church of the living God. But the king said it was all right in their day. So they took down the altars of God and put up the altars of Baal. And today we've tucked down the oldfashioned banners of holiness and righteousness &gt;&gt; and put up the modern trend of denomination. We belong to certain certain great order. &gt;&gt; We call ourselves Christians because we belong to a certain order. That's not Christianity. Christianity is a born to get experience with God. Being filled with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; cleaned up from a life of sin. &gt;&gt; Living clean and holy before God and man. That takes the stain of death away. Death becomes an a victory. I was speaking with the wife this morning. I told her, I said, we was talking of death. I said, "Since I got saved 30 years ago as a boy, ever since then, it seems like I'm in a nightmare." &gt;&gt; She said, "What do you mean?" I said in this life something happened down in me that makes me know that there's a land somewhere and I'm shaking myself to wake up &gt;&gt; someday death will wake me into his presence. &gt;&gt; Did you ever have a nightmare and just wanted to get out of it and you would jerking and jumping. You want to wake up because you know there's a reality somewhere that's far beyond that nightmare. So is it to every Christian born again always has been Abraham and Isaac and them said they were pilgrims and strangers. They were seeking a city to come. That's the way he was. &gt;&gt; We were going to the grocery a few weeks ago. [Music] [Music]
