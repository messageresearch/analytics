[42:27] [Music]
[42:31] praise the Lord
[42:35] Hallelujah
[42:39] this is a
[42:42] just an update on
[42:46] [Music]
[42:48] Brother Mac
[42:51] or take
[42:52] we've been praying for from down South
[42:55] Carolina
[42:56] preacher
[42:58] is about 80 years old
[43:02] very good
[43:04] solid preacher
[43:06] [Music]
[43:08] and this is from his daughter
[43:12] there that
[43:14] she gave us updates uh some few times
[43:16] Daddy
[43:18] was able to get out of bed
[43:22] and sit in a in a chair for about an
[43:25] hour
[43:27] also today if everything continued to go
[43:31] well looks like he may get to go home
[43:35] the beginning of the week
[43:38] he is
[43:40] to go see a vascular doctor
[43:45] on November 18th
[43:49] to have a CD scan done on his brain and
[43:54] his heart again the doctor
[43:56] the
[43:58] will
[44:00] decide on for the plane if Audrey is
[44:05] still needed
[44:06] and Doc and daddy is doing better in his
[44:10] in his strength then surgery will be
[44:13] after after Thanksgiving
[44:17] the soldering
[44:20] will be a bypass
[44:22] and stand possibly done
[44:25] [Music]
[44:27] as second as two separate surgery a
[44:31] bypass and then stem he had a bypass
[44:34] surgery uh some years now so this would
[44:38] be pretty much the second because of the
[44:42] impact of the soil of the accident
[44:45] and uh
[44:47] so I think that's why they are going
[44:49] back there our prayers
[44:52] now are that he can get strength to be
[44:56] able to handle the surgery if needed
[44:59] appreciate everything

[45:54] cancer situation
[45:56] so but they need to bring her body up to

[1:02:10] I don't I just have one
[1:02:12] one major quote to reading it is mostly
[1:02:16] concerning the community service tonight
[1:02:18] I was going to read that from the
[1:02:19] beginning of the service this morning
[1:02:21] and then just go into dive into what I
[1:02:24] want to talk about let's read from verse
[1:02:26] 13 in Hebrew chapter 6. Hebrew chapter 6
[1:02:30] verse 13 for when God made
[1:02:34] promise to Abraham because he could
[1:02:37] swear by no greater
[1:02:39] he swear by himself
[1:02:43] saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:02:46] in multiplying I will multiply thee
[1:02:50] and so after he had patiently endured
[1:02:55] he attended the promise
[1:02:59] for men very less words
[1:03:01] by the greater
[1:03:04] and an old
[1:03:07] for confirmation
[1:03:10] is to them and end of all strife
[1:03:14] praise the Lord
[1:03:17] he will not imagine how many hours I
[1:03:20] stay on this scripture yesterday
[1:03:24] because there is there is just just yeah
[1:03:27] yeah let me let me read and have you
[1:03:29] just sit there and I will tell you my
[1:03:30] story
[1:03:33] where in God
[1:03:35] willing more abundantly to show on to
[1:03:39] the hearers of promise
[1:03:41] their immutability of his counsel
[1:03:44] confirm it by an ought
[1:03:48] thereby two immutable things in which it
[1:03:51] is impossible for God to lie
[1:03:54] we might have a strong consolation
[1:03:57] who have fled for Refuge to lay hold
[1:04:02] upon the Hope set before us
[1:04:07] which hope we have as an anchor
[1:04:11] of the Soul
[1:04:13] both show and stay fast what an anchor
[1:04:17] show and stay fast
[1:04:20] and which enter it into
[1:04:25] that within the Veil
[1:04:29] whether the Forerunner is for US enter
[1:04:33] even Jesus
[1:04:35] made on high priest forever after the
[1:04:39] other
[1:04:40] of Melchizedek
[1:04:43] praise the Lord
[1:04:44] let's pray together Heavenly Father
[1:04:46] please Lord
[1:04:48] we need your help this morning
[1:04:51] God if you we need your help Lord and
[1:04:54] that your name will be lifted up among
[1:04:57] your people oh god father we pray that
[1:05:01] you will bless the service now Lord
[1:05:03] bless the effort the prayers the
[1:05:05] sacrifice of your children this morning
[1:05:07] we just commit all things in your hands
[1:05:10] in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord
[1:05:14] bless you you may have your seeds
[1:05:18] praise the Lord
[1:05:21] I I thought I struggle to even give the
[1:05:26] the the message a title
[1:05:29] so I have a promise confirmed by an art
[1:05:32] that is really not what I wanted to need
[1:05:34] to title my sermon but I just have to
[1:05:37] find something
[1:05:38] to put there
[1:05:40] and the reason is that let me give you a
[1:05:42] little picture of of where my my strugle
[1:05:46] was yesterday
[1:05:48] you know for a long time I have I have I
[1:05:51] have uh I've ponder over this in my mind
[1:05:54] for many years that God swerved by
[1:05:58] himself
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:02] and in in as much as
[1:06:05] is uh is a beautiful thing it's a very
[1:06:08] interesting subject mahima mind has
[1:06:12] always struggled
[1:06:14] why do God have to swear
[1:06:17] back in Leviticus chapter 19 verse 12
[1:06:20] God says thou shall not swear
[1:06:25] thou shall not sword using the name of
[1:06:29] the Lord
[1:06:30] praise the Lord
[1:06:32] and every time that a man will have to
[1:06:35] swear
[1:06:37] and that that that the thing there is
[1:06:40] that the whole thing behind this whole
[1:06:41] sweating thing is is because of Lies
[1:06:46] amen I heard somebody say something
[1:06:49] during the week and I I kept telling
[1:06:52] myself a repeating it so it would just
[1:06:54] stick in my mind because that was just a
[1:06:56] good line that says if you tell the
[1:06:59] truth you will not need a good memory
[1:07:03] yeah amen
[1:07:05] right if you always tell the truth you
[1:07:08] don't have to worry about a good memory
[1:07:13] praise the Lord amen and when I heard
[1:07:17] that I kept repeating I said wow that's
[1:07:19] I love that let me let me let me say it
[1:07:21] again tell yourself a better one if you
[1:07:24] tell the truth you won't have to bother
[1:07:26] about a good memory
[1:07:29] so so that's that is the whole thing
[1:07:32] that makes me kept thinking about this
[1:07:34] and it's been this I've been many years
[1:07:36] and the truth about the matter that is
[1:07:39] that I've never I don't remember one
[1:07:41] time I even preached on the message uh
[1:07:44] on this context of God swearing by
[1:07:47] himself is because
[1:07:50] I've I've been trying to
[1:07:53] to to set it up I mean even this entire
[1:07:57] week I went through all the messages uh
[1:08:00] uh magazette the great Prince the entire
[1:08:02] Hebrew series and uh Wilbert Brandon
[1:08:06] will talk about God you know swearing by
[1:08:09] himself and and then a lot of course too
[1:08:12] and and just trying to you know just to
[1:08:16] see what what is the mind of God in
[1:08:19] there what is there I know that God did
[1:08:22] that to be able to confirm his promise
[1:08:27] to Abraham
[1:08:29] praise the Lord he did it to confirm his
[1:08:32] promise but he's God he don't need to do
[1:08:35] that
[1:08:36] amen but you see how much that God
[1:08:40] will stoop to our level
[1:08:45] praise the Lord
[1:08:47] yet to do us a favor
[1:08:51] to do us a favor he was stoop down to
[1:08:54] our level sometimes God will will you
[1:08:57] know will we have to even identify
[1:09:00] himself
[1:09:01] you know in in our shame
[1:09:04] you have to identify himself in some of
[1:09:07] our embarrassment just to be able to
[1:09:11] tell you that I will never leave you I
[1:09:13] will never forsake you
[1:09:16] praise the Lord that's the greatness of
[1:09:19] God God greatness is not that he can
[1:09:23] bless the entire word and make a new
[1:09:26] word the greatness of God that in his
[1:09:29] greatness and his Holiness he can stay
[1:09:32] stoop down to our level
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:35] praise the Lord
[1:09:37] amen that's the reason why the Way Up Is
[1:09:41] Down
[1:09:44] that's God greatness
[1:09:47] if we can only see his greatness in the
[1:09:49] Sun the moon and the stars and the work
[1:09:52] that he created and don't see his
[1:09:55] greatness in becoming a man
[1:10:00] to take our sin upon his shoulder
[1:10:03] then you don't know the greatness of God
[1:10:07] praise the Lord
[1:10:09] amen
[1:10:11] because whenever a man have a little
[1:10:15] sense of greatness he never comes down
[1:10:20] he never comes down now you know he's uh
[1:10:24] you want to you want to have a big
[1:10:27] status
[1:10:28] this evening we will have a convenience
[1:10:31] service
[1:10:33] and I choose to read this and and like I
[1:10:37] was saying that's I think that's that's
[1:10:39] just the only thing that I have here
[1:10:42] because I want to go in this in this
[1:10:45] direction
[1:10:46] and uh
[1:10:49] this is from communion
[1:10:51] see there's
[1:10:53] their reason
[1:10:54] that's the reason I'm saying that you
[1:10:57] understand what you are doing if if you
[1:11:01] walk into anything blindly
[1:11:04] you don't know where what you are doing
[1:11:07] you you can have enough confidence
[1:11:11] if you don't know what you are doing
[1:11:14] but you must understand
[1:11:16] what you are doing and why you are doing
[1:11:20] it
[1:11:20] now I I've copied these quotes uh I
[1:11:24] think before like before I travel
[1:11:27] so while we were having one of the
[1:11:29] services there uh uh uh
[1:11:34] uh
[1:11:36] brother Daly was preaching to the church
[1:11:38] and and uh he was he was speaking on
[1:11:42] something and then he he said
[1:11:45] he said do you know that we take an
[1:11:47] ought
[1:11:48] when we when we the communion is a
[1:11:51] symbol of an ought okay I'm not I'm not
[1:11:54] saying the right words but that was that
[1:11:56] was what I grabbed and and I and I wrote
[1:11:59] it down you know I wrote it on my
[1:12:00] notebook and when he said that my mind
[1:12:04] referred to what I'm reading and
[1:12:06] surprisingly he quoted what I'm reading
[1:12:09] he just he just paraphrased it so it
[1:12:12] then it got my mind you know this
[1:12:15] particular subject got my mind how the
[1:12:17] the the communion is a symbol of an odd
[1:12:21] now listen to brother Branham yeah he
[1:12:23] says they are now in in other words
[1:12:27] don't just come
[1:12:30] don't just come to take it there's a
[1:12:32] communion he says as I said a while ago
[1:12:35] about what the Jews their sacrifice it
[1:12:40] was wonderful it was given by God but it
[1:12:43] got to a place where they didn't they
[1:12:47] didn't do it sincerely and reverently
[1:12:51] and in order
[1:12:53] then it became a stinged in his nose
[1:12:56] that he referenced in the book of Isaiah
[1:12:59] amen where the scripture says every
[1:13:02] table has become a vomit
[1:13:04] now the same thing is by our coming to
[1:13:08] take the Lord's Supper that we must come
[1:13:11] knowing what we are doing now I
[1:13:15] purposely in my heart prayed about this
[1:13:17] and thought that I would use this and
[1:13:19] talk to us as a church a little bit I
[1:13:22] love uh uh uh the communion just like
[1:13:26] every ordinance in the Bible and just
[1:13:29] like I said before the communion has a
[1:13:33] spiritual significance for a church
[1:13:37] we spoke on the shout of the king that
[1:13:40] is in a camp and we talked about the
[1:13:42] supernatural element that gathered
[1:13:44] Israel
[1:13:45] praise the Lord
[1:13:47] and before the people will start to
[1:13:50] experience that Supernatural element God
[1:13:53] brought them into a covenant he brought
[1:13:57] them into an oath by taking the
[1:14:00] communion the Lord's Supper
[1:14:02] they were to they were to have the
[1:14:05] Passover that night
[1:14:07] with the blood on the door of the lane
[1:14:09] tail the very animal that they were they
[1:14:13] were going to partake and eat all with
[1:14:15] bitter herbs was the same animal blood
[1:14:18] they had to put on the doorpost praise
[1:14:20] the Lord
[1:14:21] and and that brought them into they
[1:14:25] could not understand you know roasting
[1:14:28] this meat eating it with with bitter
[1:14:30] herbs and all of that but it brought
[1:14:32] them it introduced them into a spiritual
[1:14:35] atmosphere
[1:14:37] he introduced them to the blessing of
[1:14:40] these Supernatural things there was
[1:14:43] there was that was around them the
[1:14:45] pillow of fire the brazing serpent the
[1:14:47] smithing rock and all of that now so uh
[1:14:51] uh uh the communion is is is just as
[1:14:54] much because by water baptism we we come
[1:14:58] forth and we confess by identifying
[1:15:01] ourselves with with the Lord Jesus
[1:15:03] Christ we identify with his death with
[1:15:06] his barrier and his resurrection when we
[1:15:08] are put down into the water and we are
[1:15:10] raising up to newness of Life praise the
[1:15:13] Lord
[1:15:14] and then uh uh in their way we have now
[1:15:21] become member of the mystical body of
[1:15:23] Jesus Christ praise the Lord
[1:15:26] like Peter said water do not signify uh
[1:15:31] uh putting away the faith of the flesh
[1:15:33] but it shows a good conscience towards
[1:15:35] God
[1:15:36] praise the Lord that's where the joining
[1:15:39] begins with a good conscience towards
[1:15:41] God it brings you the fear of God and
[1:15:43] all of that and then you walk in by
[1:15:46] faith now so uh when you when we come to
[1:15:49] this thing and and we approach the
[1:15:51] communion table by faith with reverence
[1:15:54] and respect now if we are not living up
[1:15:57] to what God expect us we have no right
[1:16:00] taking the communion because we will
[1:16:02] just be uh we will just be creating
[1:16:04] problems for ourselves
[1:16:07] now now uh by coming to the table we
[1:16:10] must come knowing what we are doing just
[1:16:13] like when we go into the water to be
[1:16:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:19] Christ you know what you are doing you
[1:16:22] are identifying yourself with the death
[1:16:24] the barrier and the resurrection of
[1:16:27] Jesus Christ you must now be baptized to
[1:16:30] join the church amen you must not be
[1:16:32] baptized just I mean just to be you must
[1:16:35] know they are by faith I have accepted
[1:16:38] the Lord Jesus Christ as my Lord and
[1:16:40] Savior I believe that he died for my sin
[1:16:43] that's the reason why I want to identify
[1:16:46] myself with his death with his
[1:16:48] resurrection amen praise the Lord so we
[1:16:51] must know what we are doing and and and
[1:16:54] and that is the way that parents we must
[1:16:56] teach our children you know when they
[1:16:58] bring a baptism uh conversation to us
[1:17:02] uh
[1:17:04] know what you are doing you are putting
[1:17:07] on to the church what God has put in you
[1:17:11] Christ amen
[1:17:13] he says uh when when when we take this
[1:17:17] which is the law support a show to the
[1:17:19] church that I believe every word of God
[1:17:25] amen
[1:17:27] I believe that he is the bread of life
[1:17:30] that comes from heaven
[1:17:32] or that comes from God out of Heaven I
[1:17:35] believe every word that he said is the
[1:17:39] truth
[1:17:40] I live by it to the best of my knowledge
[1:17:44] now when you when we walk to the
[1:17:47] communion table that's what you are
[1:17:49] saying that's the witness that you have
[1:17:52] in your heart
[1:17:53] to the best of my knowledge
[1:17:56] praise the Lord amen amen well if I did
[1:17:59] something to you and uh and and I'm not
[1:18:03] aware of it if you don't come to tell me
[1:18:05] uh and you said I mean look look at him
[1:18:07] that he's going to the community with
[1:18:09] that that's your problem
[1:18:12] amen that's your problem and that is the
[1:18:16] reason why I believe that uh night
[1:18:19] before the communion or the morning
[1:18:21] before the communion family should be
[1:18:24] able to sit down together amen we must
[1:18:26] be able to try some other things you
[1:18:28] know that is that it's among us we must
[1:18:30] learn to say oh I'm sorry that I did
[1:18:33] this to you I'm very sorry that I did
[1:18:35] this to you you know the mommy you hurt
[1:18:38] my feelings you shouldn't have said that
[1:18:40] to me oh I'm sorry you shouldn't have
[1:18:43] done this I mean we should be we should
[1:18:45] be able to have that heart to do it
[1:18:49] that's the right attitude
[1:18:54] if a brother is not happy with his wife
[1:18:57] on something he must be able to tell her
[1:18:59] well I didn't like you did this you know
[1:19:01] this there that we we have a communion
[1:19:03] before us tonight you know I don't know
[1:19:04] why I was keeping this thing but uh you
[1:19:07] know I just uh if if there is anything
[1:19:09] that we can remember
[1:19:10] we must trash you out
[1:19:14] because it's for your own good
[1:19:19] man
[1:19:24] if there is a brother or a sister you
[1:19:27] know in the assembly that maybe they
[1:19:29] said something and uh uh I mean uh they
[1:19:33] were not paying attention and and you
[1:19:35] you never felt good about it or you
[1:19:37] heard it from somebody go and meet the
[1:19:38] person right
[1:19:42] right it's not this person said this
[1:19:43] about me this other person said this
[1:19:45] about me
[1:19:51] praise the Lord because you see when the
[1:19:54] church is is is is is clean in that
[1:19:57] attitude in the sense that if we have
[1:20:00] the the attitude to be able to reconcile
[1:20:03] ourselves with one another and be
[1:20:06] opening to talk to one another sorry
[1:20:08] brother I did this to you I'm very sorry
[1:20:10] I did this to you and and now what we
[1:20:13] are doing is that we are bringing the
[1:20:15] Lord on our defense
[1:20:20] praise the Lord
[1:20:21] when Paul says who can hold anything
[1:20:24] against God's elect
[1:20:26] is why because everything is under the
[1:20:29] blood
[1:20:33] praise the Lord because everything is
[1:20:36] under the blood that's the reason why no
[1:20:39] man can hold nothing against God skillet
[1:20:44] amen
[1:20:46] Israel
[1:20:48] they have problems
[1:20:50] for the fact that they could get down to
[1:20:52] bahapura and and and their lost Spirit
[1:20:55] could just overtake them they start
[1:20:57] running around with mobile I.T girls and
[1:20:59] all of that it means that a lot loss was
[1:21:02] always in their heart right praise the
[1:21:05] Lord
[1:21:07] but you see uh uh uh God
[1:21:12] cover the back part of his people
[1:21:17] could not see anything
[1:21:19] and he broke into prophecy I cannot see
[1:21:22] no iniquity in Jacob
[1:21:27] praise the Lord
[1:21:30] David said the same thing blessed is the
[1:21:33] man in whom
[1:21:37] the Lord will not impute iniquity
[1:21:40] why is that man that have come under the
[1:21:43] atonement of Christ's blood neither one
[1:21:46] that is walking in his own
[1:21:47] self-righteousness
[1:21:50] is the man that have found the courage
[1:21:52] to make his way right by the word of God
[1:21:57] no very bad
[1:22:00] are we together
[1:22:06] you see the reason why
[1:22:09] I love the communion is because it
[1:22:11] helped me to protect myself
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:16] it helped me to protect myself and to
[1:22:18] protect the church
[1:22:21] because I mean the Lord has not blessed
[1:22:23] me with a gift of vision
[1:22:27] he have not blessed me with uh uh you
[1:22:30] know a higher level of discernment
[1:22:34] I have some level but not higher to know
[1:22:36] you know to start telling you you did
[1:22:38] this is where you went I don't have that
[1:22:41] praise the Lord but if if I can bring
[1:22:46] the the the the Covenant the audience of
[1:22:49] God Among the people
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:54] and challenge you to be sincere
[1:22:57] and challenge myself to be sincere
[1:22:59] praise the Lord
[1:23:01] amen am I telling you my secret that's
[1:23:04] why I like it because to me it's a
[1:23:06] protection
[1:23:07] praise the Lord if you are not sincere
[1:23:10] that one is up to you and God
[1:23:14] I tell the Lord I go in that office I
[1:23:16] say Lord I've done the best that I know
[1:23:18] how to do
[1:23:20] take it from here
[1:23:23] and deal with the hearts of your people
[1:23:30] praise the Lord
[1:23:31] it's not when that I mean we we uh uh
[1:23:35] you know uh fussing and fighting
[1:23:38] carrying this and carrying that and then
[1:23:40] you know uh then immediately we come to
[1:23:43] church everybody become an angel
[1:23:47] no we will still have things that we
[1:23:50] differ from one another that we struggle
[1:23:53] with
[1:23:54] but we must have the heart
[1:23:58] to apologize
[1:24:02] praise the Lord
[1:24:04] there was something that kind of first
[1:24:05] uh struck me yesterday as I was as I was
[1:24:08] looking into into the word
[1:24:12] and uh
[1:24:15] it just it just it just took my entire
[1:24:18] day because I it just blew my mind and I
[1:24:22] just couldn't get over it
[1:24:24] praise the Lord
[1:24:26] amen the word sword I was looking at
[1:24:29] that in the Hebrew
[1:24:32] it means
[1:24:34] for you to say something seven times
[1:24:39] meaning that you are saying it seven
[1:24:41] times meaning that what I'm saying is
[1:24:44] the truth then there was just a whole
[1:24:46] lot of things that Jesus came together
[1:24:48] in my mind
[1:24:51] why Jesus will say forgive your brother
[1:24:54] Seventy Times Seven and there was just a
[1:24:57] whole lot of seven things that were just
[1:24:59] all coming to my mind but let's go ahead
[1:25:02] right here
[1:25:03] oh
[1:25:09] I believe that Jesus is the bread of
[1:25:11] life that comes from God out of Heaven I
[1:25:14] believe every word that he says is the
[1:25:17] truth if there is something that we are
[1:25:19] preaching here that you are struggling
[1:25:21] with is better you say it
[1:25:26] say well you know you know I really want
[1:25:28] to understand that I always struggle
[1:25:30] when you preach this I always struggle
[1:25:32] when you say this
[1:25:36] praise the Lord
[1:25:37] because as as far as I know there is
[1:25:40] nobody that is head on a gun point to
[1:25:42] believe what is being preached here
[1:25:45] amen
[1:25:47] so I believe every word is to be truth
[1:25:50] and I live to eat to the best of my
[1:25:53] knowledge God being my judge now when
[1:25:56] you see that it's it's almost as a sense
[1:25:59] that you are you are getting into an odd
[1:26:02] you are saying to the best of my
[1:26:04] knowledge
[1:26:05] so help me God that's that's why you say
[1:26:08] in the court amen that you put your hand
[1:26:10] upon the Bible you say so help me God
[1:26:14] praise the Lord so that's exactly what
[1:26:16] you do when you take that bread that's
[1:26:18] exactly what you are doing you say so
[1:26:20] help me God
[1:26:22] I believe every word I believe your
[1:26:25] promise Amen to the best of my knowledge
[1:26:28] Lord and the faith that you have given
[1:26:30] me I'm doing my best to live for you
[1:26:32] amen
[1:26:34] praise the Lord you know where I need
[1:26:36] you the most Hallelujah
[1:26:43] therefore
[1:26:45] before my brothers before my sister
[1:26:48] I do not swear I do not curse
[1:26:53] I do not do these things because I love
[1:26:58] the Lord
[1:26:59] and the Lord knows it and they mean
[1:27:04] record
[1:27:05] therefore before you I take this
[1:27:08] password of bread
[1:27:10] this parcel of his body to know that I
[1:27:14] am not condemned with the word
[1:27:17] see there you are then it's a blessing
[1:27:21] he says when you do it that way it's a
[1:27:24] blessing
[1:27:26] praise the Lord amen if you are just
[1:27:29] doing it to be counted in the number you
[1:27:31] have to reconsider what you are doing
[1:27:36] he says and remember I could give many
[1:27:39] testimony
[1:27:41] on this where I have took that
[1:27:44] and explain it in a sick room
[1:27:47] and see them heal
[1:27:51] praise the lord it's a better brand I'm
[1:27:54] taking communion to a believer that is
[1:27:56] sick and and explaining it
[1:27:59] identifying yourself with the sacrifice
[1:28:04] he says and see them taking it and
[1:28:07] getting well
[1:28:11] remember when Israel when Israel taking
[1:28:15] the type of this they're joining 40
[1:28:18] years in the wilderness and they are
[1:28:22] close
[1:28:23] never even wore out
[1:28:26] what was that the blessing of the
[1:28:28] communion
[1:28:29] amen
[1:28:31] the Lord knows our needs
[1:28:35] so the blessing of the communion provide
[1:28:38] for us
[1:28:42] even though we don't have money to be
[1:28:44] able to shop in and change our wardrobe
[1:28:47] every month but yet the grace of God
[1:28:50] make us to dress decent and people don't
[1:28:53] even know the difference
[1:28:54] that we're just swapping paints and
[1:28:57] shirts
[1:28:59] what is that is the blessing of the
[1:29:01] communion
[1:29:09] are we together
[1:29:11] Ezra took that in a typing in the
[1:29:14] wilderness 40 years
[1:29:17] with our one feeble one among them
[1:29:21] two million people
[1:29:23] in this type well
[1:29:25] what would the anti-type do
[1:29:28] if the body of a sacrificial animal they
[1:29:32] there for them what will the body
[1:29:35] of Jesus Christ do
[1:29:39] praise the Lord
[1:29:44] what would the body of Jesus Emmanuel do
[1:29:46] for us let just be revering when we come
[1:29:52] let us be just as reverent as we know
[1:29:55] how
[1:29:56] when we come praise the Lord so I invite
[1:30:00] you this afternoon if you have time uh I
[1:30:04] think we will be sitting back for 4 30.
[1:30:07] 430 will be seated back 4 30 and then we
[1:30:11] go right into the community service this
[1:30:13] evening
[1:30:15] so we have read the scripture
[1:30:17] and I want to I want to go into my
[1:30:20] subject tonight
[1:30:21] what I want to look at here is uh I want
[1:30:25] to I want to look at uh the difference
[1:30:28] between
[1:30:30] uh
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:33] swearing
[1:30:34] and swearing with an oat
[1:30:37] now so I keep giving you update on my on
[1:30:41] my travel since I can bring it in one in
[1:30:43] one I'm not you know I'm not very good
[1:30:46] in making reports I gave it bit in
[1:30:48] pieces
[1:30:49] you know I'm not very good in there
[1:30:51] there are people that are very good they
[1:30:53] can you know just put everything down
[1:30:55] and give you a clear picture they can
[1:30:57] even make you travel with them with me I
[1:31:00] get you lost amen I leave you on the
[1:31:03] road somewhere
[1:31:05] praise the Lord so we have in these
[1:31:07] meetings for brother Elijah brother
[1:31:09] Daley preached the first night Monday
[1:31:11] night uh I mean he read he really
[1:31:14] brought a blessing to his church but it
[1:31:16] was it was tight because they had a
[1:31:18] Sunday service and then went into a
[1:31:19] three days Monday Tuesday Wednesday uh
[1:31:23] Revival meetings brother Daly had to
[1:31:25] leave on Mondays uh on on Tuesday so he
[1:31:30] had to preach Monday night and then uh
[1:31:33] preach on Tuesday and then brother Simon
[1:31:35] Peter there in uh New York Connecticut
[1:31:39] New Yorker he preached on uh on
[1:31:42] Wednesday so I was not there I went over
[1:31:45] to uh to the other Church to preach and
[1:31:50] uh and then when we came home we started
[1:31:52] talking you know he was sharing with me
[1:31:54] what he preached I was sharing with him
[1:31:56] how the service go and all of that then
[1:31:59] he preached on the message uh uh God saw
[1:32:02] by himself
[1:32:04] you know now a couple of days before
[1:32:06] brother Daly have made this comment
[1:32:08] about uh you know the community as an
[1:32:11] odd and he's talking about God so he
[1:32:13] just put my my whole mind now goes back
[1:32:16] to this subject you know about God
[1:32:19] swearing so I I said I have to look into
[1:32:21] this you know I have to look into this
[1:32:24] but the subject started becoming
[1:32:27] interesting because uh uh
[1:32:31] you know uh the the difference between
[1:32:36] swearing
[1:32:37] and making
[1:32:39] and swearing with an ought
[1:32:42] every time God's word
[1:32:44] he swore with an ought
[1:32:49] amen
[1:32:50] every time he swore he swear with an
[1:32:52] oath
[1:32:54] now so that now just it just got you
[1:32:59] know it got me on the spin and I started
[1:33:01] looking into the subject and I said well
[1:33:04] okay
[1:33:05] we having a communion coming I'm
[1:33:07] thinking about uh you know talking to
[1:33:10] the church and how we how we have to uh
[1:33:12] uh rightly appreciate you know behave
[1:33:15] ourselves come in by faith and all of
[1:33:17] that so I might I might just talk on
[1:33:20] that on the Sunday morning before the
[1:33:22] community service so here I am
[1:33:25] praise the Lord I need all your help
[1:33:29] I need all your help because I was in a
[1:33:31] in a kind of a roller coaster yesterday
[1:33:33] going back and forth with just different
[1:33:36] things pranking year and day but
[1:33:40] God I was going to speak on the
[1:33:44] Redemption
[1:33:46] our Redemption
[1:33:48] god making a promise let me go simply
[1:33:50] this way to Abraham
[1:33:54] confirming to Abraham that I will give
[1:33:57] you a c Genesis 15.
[1:33:59] God confirming to Abraham
[1:34:02] Abraham have come to God to let God
[1:34:05] knows I'm getting old and here is Eliza
[1:34:09] he has been a good servant in my house
[1:34:11] he was born in my house he's you know he
[1:34:14] knows everything about this household
[1:34:16] maybe he can God say no it will have to
[1:34:20] be a son that that comes out of you
[1:34:23] so God now engaging Abraham into that he
[1:34:28] took Abraham in the field told him to
[1:34:30] take all the animals for the sacrifice
[1:34:32] so God is going to make a covenant with
[1:34:35] it with Abraham
[1:34:37] praise the Lord
[1:34:39] and not only making the coveting but
[1:34:42] almighty God is also going to soar which
[1:34:45] man in one sense God is going to hold
[1:34:48] himself accountable to his word
[1:34:53] praise the Lord amen and he swore by
[1:34:57] himself because uh uh there is no one
[1:35:00] greater than him
[1:35:05] and not only that but he also swerved
[1:35:09] with an ought
[1:35:15] like brother Brandon will explain in
[1:35:18] that he says that's the ancient way when
[1:35:21] those people they make a covenant they
[1:35:24] bow themselves and says if I don't keep
[1:35:26] this Covenant Let Me Be As Dead As this
[1:35:29] dead animal
[1:35:31] okay
[1:35:33] praise the Lord
[1:35:37] so we we know the story there in Genesis
[1:35:40] 15 if you don't know it go back and read
[1:35:42] it Abraham you know took all the
[1:35:44] sacrifice dividing them into two and uh
[1:35:47] but he did not split the thought of he
[1:35:49] just put one year one year because that
[1:35:51] represents Divine Healing so uh uh uh
[1:35:55] their God made a covenant he made a
[1:35:59] promise to Abraham and then over it he
[1:36:02] swore by himself
[1:36:06] any swear with an ought
[1:36:09] so they then I started looking into into
[1:36:12] all of that
[1:36:14] and trying to see
[1:36:17] their importance Matthew Chapter 5 when
[1:36:20] Jesus came he he repeated it to the
[1:36:23] disciple you should not swear by the
[1:36:25] heaven
[1:36:26] or by the Earth
[1:36:28] praise the Lord you must not even swear
[1:36:31] by your head because you did not make
[1:36:32] yourself
[1:36:36] Jesus said that James also said that in
[1:36:39] James 5 toward he says brother let your
[1:36:42] ye be ye be a man of your word
[1:36:48] amen thou shall not sword let your year
[1:36:51] be yet and your no no so the whole thing
[1:36:54] about swearing is because men do not
[1:36:58] keep their word
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:03] men do not keep their word
[1:37:06] now but then if you look in the
[1:37:08] scripture here what is going to make the
[1:37:10] the the the the the subject important is
[1:37:14] that as you go down and and and you and
[1:37:18] you look into into the subject you will
[1:37:21] realize that uh uh there are many places
[1:37:25] in the Bible
[1:37:26] were like Robert Brown says in Christ is
[1:37:29] the mission of God revealed the Old
[1:37:31] Testament characters they play out
[1:37:33] things that it really did not understand
[1:37:34] take for example when Israel was going
[1:37:38] into the promised land when it got over
[1:37:40] Numbers Chapter 9. there was a group of
[1:37:44] amorites and what these amorites did
[1:37:47] word they disguise themselves they took
[1:37:50] all bread molded bread you know because
[1:37:52] everybody have heard about uh the
[1:37:55] Israelites how they are flushing the
[1:37:57] land there you know so these people they
[1:38:00] dress themselves and they came to uh to
[1:38:04] uh Joshua and told Joshua that they are
[1:38:08] givenites they are they are a group of
[1:38:12] backslid in Israel you know that wander
[1:38:15] somewhere you know and and they just
[1:38:17] they just disguise themselves that way
[1:38:20] praise the Lord
[1:38:22] and God have a law we will get we will
[1:38:26] get to that that will become very
[1:38:27] important when we get to it
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:31] where he told the children of Israel
[1:38:33] that you should not make a lead
[1:38:36] yes amen
[1:38:38] don't make her leave it also means a
[1:38:41] vowed or it means an ought
[1:38:46] until you really knows what is going on
[1:38:51] praise the Lord
[1:38:53] but what we're hoping here is that uh uh
[1:38:58] Joshua and his men really never
[1:39:01] investigated these people because of the
[1:39:03] old clothes they were wearing and the
[1:39:06] more their bread and the way they make
[1:39:08] theirselves so sorry for
[1:39:10] right
[1:39:12] they went and make an agreement with
[1:39:15] them that they will not kill them
[1:39:20] pretty soon it never take no time
[1:39:25] they realize that
[1:39:27] these people were not given us they were
[1:39:30] just amorites
[1:39:34] now the thing about swearing the thing
[1:39:37] about vow is that you cannot take it
[1:39:40] back
[1:39:41] right amen
[1:39:44] you cannot take it back
[1:39:47] praise the Lord
[1:39:50] oh I hope I hope that it gets it gets
[1:39:53] interesting for you like it was for me
[1:39:55] yesterday it was just it was very it was
[1:39:58] an interesting roller coaster for me
[1:39:59] yesterday just looking into this subject
[1:40:04] it was very very interesting roller
[1:40:06] coaster let's look into Numbers Chapter
[1:40:09] 30.
[1:40:11] let's establish this into Numbers
[1:40:13] Chapter 30. if you will bear with me I'm
[1:40:17] taking you into a little bit of my own
[1:40:19] personal Bible status
[1:40:22] so just bear with me
[1:40:34] this part of the subject
[1:40:41] this part of the subject
[1:40:47] will bring us into something
[1:40:53] an understanding of hairship
[1:40:57] foreign
[1:41:08] and Moses speak until the head of the
[1:41:11] tribes concerning the children of Israel
[1:41:14] saying
[1:41:15] this is the thing which the Lord has
[1:41:18] commanded
[1:41:21] if a man vow a vow unto the Lord
[1:41:26] all swear and ought
[1:41:29] to bound his soul
[1:41:32] now that is the difference between
[1:41:36] swearing and swearing with an oat
[1:41:42] when you are swearing with an old you
[1:41:44] are bounding your soul you are tell you
[1:41:47] are saying they are the you know uh uh
[1:41:50] uh let let this happen to me amen
[1:41:55] praise the Lord
[1:41:57] Hallelujah
[1:41:59] are we together
[1:42:03] are we together
[1:42:05] can I ask the church to say Amen
[1:42:09] okay because I see you are all in your
[1:42:11] Deep Thoughts where is he going
[1:42:15] you're trying to catch me praise the
[1:42:18] Lord that's okay that's okay I will I
[1:42:21] pretty soon surrender I don't have to go
[1:42:23] far
[1:42:24] that's okay but this will bring us in a
[1:42:28] place place the other you will see there
[1:42:30] are certain vows
[1:42:33] a certain vowel
[1:42:35] that when we when we take unto the Lord
[1:42:37] let's let's even take let's even take
[1:42:40] our our vow of faith
[1:42:44] that we just talk about uh uh baptizing
[1:42:48] in Jesus name
[1:42:49] you come up and you said I believe the
[1:42:51] Lord Jesus and he died for my for my sin
[1:42:55] you know and uh uh you know and and that
[1:42:58] is the reason why you know when when the
[1:43:01] child when the church uh established all
[1:43:04] of this uh uh uh baptismal class and all
[1:43:07] of that it was never done like that in
[1:43:09] the scripture you know it had to be at a
[1:43:12] place where a person was convicted God
[1:43:16] move upon the person's heart and the
[1:43:19] person wants to take this commitment to
[1:43:21] follow Jesus to be identified with Jesus
[1:43:24] in water Baptist it has to be a
[1:43:26] conviction
[1:43:29] because what you don't know is that when
[1:43:31] you take that confession
[1:43:35] you abounding your soul
[1:43:39] and that's the reason why all hell break
[1:43:42] loose
[1:43:45] when you get yourself into that
[1:43:47] commitment
[1:43:48] the whole Kingdom of of of darkness is
[1:43:52] against you
[1:43:54] the devil don't have one good
[1:43:56] conversation about you
[1:44:01] praise the Lord
[1:44:03] amen
[1:44:05] so it's not just a church member thing
[1:44:10] it's not just a church member thing it's
[1:44:12] not just I'm believing the message you
[1:44:14] must have to know that you you you have
[1:44:16] you have put your soul on the line
[1:44:19] you have bound your soul to a promise
[1:44:28] so it is not a place for you to sit down
[1:44:30] and say oh I don't know why all of this
[1:44:32] thing happening to me
[1:44:34] that's that's why you committed yourself
[1:44:36] to
[1:44:37] they they have taken on the name of
[1:44:39] Jesus like Paul says
[1:44:41] will suffer persecution
[1:44:46] praise the Lord
[1:44:52] who suffer persecution you see that's
[1:44:54] the reason why all of these mega
[1:44:57] churches that are all into Prosperity
[1:44:59] they don't have they don't have to
[1:45:01] baptize you
[1:45:03] they don't do baptism
[1:45:05] right baptism is not something that they
[1:45:07] do they are not interested in it
[1:45:12] or they are interested in you sow seed
[1:45:15] and you will get blessed that's all they
[1:45:17] preach
[1:45:17] just motivational gospel so you to
[1:45:20] motivate you to put your hands in your
[1:45:22] pocket sell your land sell your car come
[1:45:24] and sold seeds and God will bless you
[1:45:26] get rich overnight
[1:45:28] they don't teach the principal things of
[1:45:30] faith
[1:45:39] praise the Lord
[1:45:41] now so that's one of the think one of
[1:45:44] the second thing that also there is that
[1:45:46] your marriage vow
[1:45:49] it's about where you bound your soul
[1:45:53] it's not a six-month contract
[1:46:00] the marriage covenant says till death do
[1:46:02] us part
[1:46:05] amen amen
[1:46:10] and brother Brahm says they even
[1:46:12] continue after death
[1:46:15] to the Believers
[1:46:18] they continue after death
[1:46:20] so it's one of these things
[1:46:23] when a man vow a vowel or swear an ought
[1:46:27] to bound his soul with abound
[1:46:31] he shall not break his word
[1:46:38] he shall do I call into all that
[1:46:42] proceeded out of his mouth
[1:46:45] that's the reason why he must sit down
[1:46:52] and count the cost ask himself you know
[1:46:55] what he's going into Jesus says I mean
[1:46:57] before you get into a wall you must
[1:46:58] count the cost ask yourself what are you
[1:47:00] getting into
[1:47:02] now so you see
[1:47:04] it was a palm base that Joshua could not
[1:47:08] take his word back
[1:47:11] he have already got into a covenant with
[1:47:14] his people that they are going to be
[1:47:17] there to serve Israel to be to be uh
[1:47:20] drawing water and breaking rules there
[1:47:22] will be sevens to them praise the Lord
[1:47:25] amen yeah that's that's what happened
[1:47:28] like God gave us a little blessing then
[1:47:30] we start looking for servants
[1:47:35] amen
[1:47:38] they have just come through the
[1:47:40] Wilderness they broke their own wood
[1:47:42] they found their own food now they have
[1:47:44] entered into their promise they want
[1:47:45] servants
[1:47:46] and they have got themselves into a
[1:47:48] league
[1:47:50] that they cannot take their word back
[1:47:54] praise the Lord
[1:47:55] it would get very interesting as we go
[1:47:58] on
[1:47:59] I'll keep you in the in in in the volume
[1:48:02] of the book today
[1:48:03] it will get very interesting as we go on
[1:48:06] but let's deal with this number chapter
[1:48:08] 13 because on as we go you will realize
[1:48:12] saw trying to gain the favor of the
[1:48:15] people
[1:48:15] he went and killed these gibber Knights
[1:48:20] and God plagued Israel for it
[1:48:28] but let's go ahead here let's let's look
[1:48:31] at this let's look at a little a little
[1:48:33] understanding of hardship right here in
[1:48:35] Numbers Chapter 30.
[1:48:38] in the volume of the book that's where
[1:48:40] we are today
[1:48:42] verse 3 if a woman also vow a vow unto
[1:48:46] the Lord
[1:48:47] and bound herself
[1:48:50] by abound being in her father's house
[1:48:56] now a principle of Hershey
[1:49:02] that's a principle of hership
[1:49:07] they are being on a hair ship she's not
[1:49:12] tied to eval
[1:49:17] without consorting the history
[1:49:25] praise the Lord
[1:49:27] we are in a societal world you know uh
[1:49:30] many many parents found out their
[1:49:33] children are married on Facebook
[1:49:41] praise the Lord
[1:49:43] as I just say it like that
[1:49:46] but uh uh if it bring us to the place
[1:49:50] where
[1:49:52] and you if you realize instead of the
[1:49:54] message you will see the other uh the
[1:49:57] the only case of anointment where
[1:50:00] brother Branham dealt with they had to
[1:50:01] be with his own son this was where
[1:50:04] brother Branham there with thy kids
[1:50:09] because the young woman was still on the
[1:50:11] edge
[1:50:12] uh in her father's house and both of
[1:50:15] them ran to the court of law to get
[1:50:17] married and are so uh by the word of God
[1:50:20] she will stay on a hair shape she needed
[1:50:24] her dare to consent
[1:50:30] are we together
[1:50:31] and that is the place that makes the
[1:50:34] position of the father important in
[1:50:37] marriage
[1:50:45] I know it is quiet
[1:50:47] but I'm still preaching
[1:50:50] amen
[1:50:52] is a very important in marriage your
[1:50:55] father will not choose who you should
[1:50:56] marry to but
[1:50:59] he must be involved
[1:51:03] the parents must be involved
[1:51:13] his hair shape
[1:51:15] is a is a very serious principle when
[1:51:18] Paul in the book of Ephesians said the
[1:51:21] head of every man is Christ the head uh
[1:51:24] the man is the head of the woman and uh
[1:51:26] and and and on and on uh uh uh there's
[1:51:30] it's it's a very very important thing
[1:51:41] are we together
[1:51:42] now you will see that's the reason why
[1:51:45] we can now swear by God in heaven
[1:51:48] why because we are finished and God is
[1:51:52] infinite
[1:51:54] if you are taking a promise that's why
[1:51:56] God will not you won't join himself to
[1:51:58] our sword he said don't swear by me
[1:52:01] your mind is limited
[1:52:05] if you want to take yourself into a prop
[1:52:07] a covenant your mind is limited I see
[1:52:11] beyond time and spaces I know what is
[1:52:14] going to happen tomorrow
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:19] so don't don't bring me into your think
[1:52:25] are we together
[1:52:30] now so we go ahead and and then we see
[1:52:33] here uh verse 3.
[1:52:37] and her father heard her vow the father
[1:52:40] heard about it
[1:52:42] and and Obama wear with she her bound
[1:52:45] her soul if the father heard about it
[1:52:47] which means she never told her father
[1:52:49] amen
[1:52:50] and her father shall hold his peace at
[1:52:54] her then all uh if he hold his peace
[1:52:58] then all her vows shall stand and and
[1:53:01] every bound where where she abound her
[1:53:03] soul shall stand but if the father
[1:53:05] disallows her in the dead dead he Gareth
[1:53:09] it praise the Lord
[1:53:12] not any of the vow or the bound where
[1:53:15] where she abound her soul shastin
[1:53:19] and the Lord shall forgive her because
[1:53:21] her father disallow it
[1:53:25] this allow her amen and if she had at
[1:53:31] all and husband now she's not under the
[1:53:35] headship of her father anymore she's now
[1:53:39] under the headship of her husband
[1:53:42] now it brings poor place in perspective
[1:53:46] if a woman have a question let her ask
[1:53:48] her husband
[1:53:52] is is that place of hership
[1:53:56] God instituted it
[1:54:00] are we together
[1:54:04] so if uh if uh if she had
[1:54:08] if she had at all and husband when she
[1:54:12] vowed or or out of her lip where if she
[1:54:17] bound her soul and her husband heard it
[1:54:20] and and he had his peace at her didn't
[1:54:23] say anything then her vow shall stand
[1:54:26] and uh and uh
[1:54:28] uh
[1:54:30] her bound where wave she bound her soul
[1:54:33] shall stand but if the if the husband
[1:54:36] disallow it on the dead that he hear it
[1:54:40] it's not on the dead word he's not happy
[1:54:42] with the guy
[1:54:45] he yeah about it he never did anything
[1:54:47] until the person they said no I don't
[1:54:50] agree
[1:54:54] the day that you hear about it is the
[1:54:56] day that you have to deal with it right
[1:55:03] praise the Lord
[1:55:06] it's the day that you have to call call
[1:55:08] the young man and says what am I hearing
[1:55:10] what is this
[1:55:12] praise the Lord
[1:55:16] are we together
[1:55:18] are you seeing the principle I'm kind of
[1:55:21] for emphasizing this because I have a
[1:55:24] lot of young people that will go into
[1:55:26] marriage and are planning to go into
[1:55:28] marriage and I've always encouraged the
[1:55:32] importance of the parents
[1:55:35] praise the Lord
[1:55:37] amen this is this is this is the
[1:55:40] scriptural basis
[1:55:42] where it is very very important
[1:55:45] you know to sit down with your your with
[1:55:47] your father and let him know well you
[1:55:50] know this this is the person that that
[1:55:52] is making friend with me and and all of
[1:55:54] that
[1:55:55] you know uh uh don't just
[1:55:58] uh uh you know
[1:56:01] get in love and fall in love
[1:56:04] when you fall it's hard to get up
[1:56:07] we want you being in love and standing
[1:56:10] up
[1:56:11] were your eyes open
[1:56:15] are we together
[1:56:17] praise the Lord you can fall after you
[1:56:19] get married
[1:56:22] because you already take the confidence
[1:56:23] so you can fall he will pick you up then
[1:56:27] praise the Lord
[1:56:29] but yeah I just I just thought that I
[1:56:31] should bring bring this part of it
[1:56:33] because when I was when I was studying
[1:56:35] on that and then uh you know I was
[1:56:39] looking through my reference and then it
[1:56:41] pointed out Numbers Chapter 30 why God
[1:56:44] the the uh you know Joshua could not
[1:56:47] take his word back because it was a
[1:56:49] commandment of God he has already vowed
[1:56:51] he has bound him so that you will never
[1:56:53] kill these people
[1:56:55] yeah yeah
[1:56:57] so no matter what the day they just have
[1:56:59] to bear with them
[1:57:02] when the elders found out that they were
[1:57:04] not given knives they were they were
[1:57:05] amorites they came to to Joshua
[1:57:08] he says we have already saw we I mean we
[1:57:11] have we have given we have created a
[1:57:13] league with them
[1:57:14] we have promised them that we will not
[1:57:16] kill them
[1:57:18] and these were the very same people
[1:57:20] according to the Book of Judges chapter
[1:57:22] one that started becoming torn in their
[1:57:24] flesh
[1:57:26] right yeah
[1:57:28] that's the danger of compromise
[1:57:35] are we together
[1:57:37] now so we go back we go back I just I I
[1:57:41] felt it necessary to go over this
[1:57:43] principle with you and uh so you can be
[1:57:46] able to to see it you can take the time
[1:57:49] and and and read it
[1:57:52] praise the Lord
[1:57:53] just like I said to you I mean a man
[1:57:56] that is dealing with that have to deal
[1:57:58] with that right there and then
[1:58:01] first Samuel chapter 24.
[1:58:11] people
[1:58:13] they will there were no
[1:58:15] no of things or heard of things that
[1:58:18] they know that is not right sorry sorry
[1:58:19] wrong wrong scripture second Samuel 21.
[1:58:24] second Samuel 21 we stay in the volume
[1:58:27] of the book today
[1:58:43] second Samuel 21
[1:58:46] then there was a farming in the days of
[1:58:49] David three years
[1:58:52] year after year and David inquired of
[1:58:55] the Lord and the Lord answered it is for
[1:59:00] Saul and for his bloody house
[1:59:04] because he slew the gibeonite
[1:59:09] and the king called the given nation and
[1:59:12] said unto them now they given us well
[1:59:16] not all the children of Israel but of
[1:59:19] the women of the amorites and the
[1:59:21] children of Israel have sown unto them
[1:59:24] and saw sought to slay them in his Zeal
[1:59:29] to the children of Israel and Judah so
[1:59:33] you see he came to power and and now
[1:59:35] he's saying I'm going to push the land
[1:59:37] of these people
[1:59:40] there is no record of these people among
[1:59:42] us I'm going to push now what he was
[1:59:45] trying to do is that he was trying to
[1:59:47] impress
[1:59:49] impress the turn of Israel to show us
[1:59:52] like yeah that's why we needed a king
[1:59:53] get rid of them
[1:59:58] praise the Lord
[1:59:59] we must not do things to impress the
[2:00:01] church
[2:00:03] praise the Lord
[2:00:04] amen
[2:00:06] Hallelujah I mean we might not do things
[2:00:09] to impress the church I mean to impress
[2:00:11] you that you know I'm I'm
[2:00:13] um I don't know what to say but
[2:00:18] what we have to do is to stay with the
[2:00:20] word
[2:00:26] now so yeah now they had this problem
[2:00:30] they have farming year after year year
[2:00:33] after year there was a curse in the land
[2:00:39] because he have slayed the blood of a
[2:00:41] people that have come on a covenant
[2:00:45] praise the Lord
[2:00:48] they have come on a covenant
[2:00:55] so now the uh David called these people
[2:00:59] and David asked of them what they needed
[2:01:02] they asked for seven sons
[2:01:04] out of the house of David let's let's
[2:01:07] read a little bit it's going to turn
[2:01:09] very interesting well for David said
[2:01:11] unto the gibber night what shall I do
[2:01:13] for you
[2:01:14] and where we shall I make an atonement
[2:01:21] that yeah
[2:01:23] May bless
[2:01:25] the inheritance of the Lord
[2:01:28] praise the Lord
[2:01:30] Hallelujah
[2:01:33] you cannot say because you are a
[2:01:35] Christian or because you are a Believer
[2:01:37] you know it gave you right to to cheat
[2:01:39] or mistreat an unbeliever no
[2:01:43] he's on a covenant he's a creature of
[2:01:45] God
[2:01:47] amen he deserved the same respect like
[2:01:51] everybody deserves
[2:01:56] now so Yara said now David is asking
[2:01:59] these people we have to make an
[2:02:01] atonement here
[2:02:04] so you can bless us that this curse will
[2:02:06] leave from the land and the given I said
[2:02:09] unto him we will have no Savor known uh
[2:02:15] non-go of Saul none of his house neither
[2:02:19] for us
[2:02:20] shall thou kill
[2:02:22] any man in Israel and he said watch what
[2:02:27] year shall say that I will do for you
[2:02:31] and the answer the king
[2:02:34] the man that consumed us
[2:02:37] what is going to happen here is the
[2:02:40] other they are going to ask for seven
[2:02:42] sons
[2:02:44] seven sons
[2:02:46] of Saul
[2:02:50] praise the Lord
[2:02:51] they are going to ask for seven sons of
[2:02:54] Silver Six let seven men of his sons be
[2:02:58] delivered unto us that we will hang them
[2:03:04] unto the Lord
[2:03:05] in ghibia of Sword womb the Lord they
[2:03:10] choose and the King said I will give
[2:03:13] them but the King still
[2:03:20] okay that's journey to a son now a
[2:03:24] create another room here
[2:03:27] why did the king spell him because David
[2:03:31] has come into a covenant he has made an
[2:03:35] art with Jonathan
[2:03:37] [Music]
[2:03:38] that's true
[2:03:40] oh my God
[2:03:42] so the house of Jonathan
[2:03:45] was to be protected by David
[2:03:49] will get to that but David also swear on
[2:03:53] to Saul
[2:03:57] but you see David swore unto Saul was
[2:04:00] now on the alt right
[2:04:03] right when David Cook saw garment
[2:04:07] Saul said my son swear unto me in this
[2:04:10] day
[2:04:12] but it was now on the alt right
[2:04:17] so a sword that is not on our old after
[2:04:21] time can be breaking yes
[2:04:28] praise the Lord
[2:04:30] I swear that is now on our old after
[2:04:33] time can be breaking you have to realize
[2:04:36] feeling house was of the house of levite
[2:04:41] and God give him a promise
[2:04:44] God gave him an everlasting promise they
[2:04:48] are the the the priesthood will be in
[2:04:51] the house of phoenixas
[2:04:54] but that was now on Earth
[2:05:02] are we together
[2:05:06] so
[2:05:09] uh
[2:05:11] are we together
[2:05:14] praise the Lord let's let's look into
[2:05:16] first Samuel chapter 20. verse 17. like
[2:05:21] I told you we're in the volume of the
[2:05:23] books today amen
[2:05:25] we are in the value of the book
[2:05:29] [Music]
[2:05:40] I hope I'll find a place here to close
[2:05:43] and
[2:05:45] first Samuel chapter 20
[2:05:50] first Samuel chapter 20 now David has
[2:05:54] suspected that saw there was a problem
[2:05:57] that Saul was Haunting his life
[2:06:00] not to take motion of the reading year
[2:06:02] so David and jonington went to the field
[2:06:05] and David told Journey turn and says I'm
[2:06:07] I'm suspecting that your dad want to
[2:06:10] kill me Jonathan said why would he do
[2:06:12] that
[2:06:13] he said well I've noticed yes I've
[2:06:15] noticed that I've noticed that while
[2:06:16] they were going to have a feast and
[2:06:18] David was supposed to be part of that
[2:06:20] Feast because David was in the house of
[2:06:22] Saul
[2:06:23] now but what will happen here is that
[2:06:25] David sent saw and I mean Journey turn
[2:06:28] and say go
[2:06:29] take my suspicion
[2:06:33] and then if you notice it is truth
[2:06:35] shoot a board of Arrow
[2:06:38] amen
[2:06:41] when I see it then I'm I'm going to go
[2:06:44] far
[2:06:45] but let's let's read this first uh uh
[2:06:49] uh verse verse 17.
[2:06:52] verse 17.
[2:07:04] now you you can go back and read the the
[2:07:07] whole thing verse 16. so journey to me a
[2:07:10] covenant with the House of David saying
[2:07:14] let the Lord even require
[2:07:18] at the hand of David's enemy
[2:07:21] amen
[2:07:23] and Jourdanton calls David to swear
[2:07:26] again
[2:07:28] because he loved him
[2:07:31] for he loved him
[2:07:34] as
[2:07:36] he loved his own soul
[2:07:42] how they call it in our dead soulmates
[2:07:47] okay
[2:07:48] so they they they have burned themselves
[2:07:51] into a covenant
[2:07:54] with an old
[2:07:57] praise the Lord
[2:07:58] so with this that's the reason why uh uh
[2:08:03] uh David because if you go back and read
[2:08:06] that scripture of the seven sons of
[2:08:09] David uh uh of Saul that was killed were
[2:08:12] the sons from his children
[2:08:16] amen
[2:08:18] the men that were born in the House of
[2:08:20] David
[2:08:22] um
[2:08:23] was also a son
[2:08:26] of Journey turn
[2:08:28] in the House of David
[2:08:31] but because of that Covenant
[2:08:37] because David and saw
[2:08:40] no David and Jonathan
[2:08:43] had a covenant word
[2:08:46] they bound their soul together
[2:08:48] if you go back and read the first time
[2:08:51] that they even met the Bible says they
[2:08:52] are so knock
[2:08:54] one after another
[2:08:58] praise the Lord
[2:09:00] amen now why why is this important
[2:09:04] why is this important because we as
[2:09:07] humans
[2:09:08] as as uh as our age change that is the
[2:09:13] same way we change sometimes in our
[2:09:16] attitude
[2:09:17] but when when brother Brandon made this
[2:09:19] statement over and over that God is
[2:09:22] obligated to his word
[2:09:28] what makes him God is because he keep
[2:09:31] his word
[2:09:33] right
[2:09:36] praise the Lord
[2:09:38] if God says in his word that he that
[2:09:42] believeth in me shall be saved God means
[2:09:45] what he says
[2:09:47] praise the Lord he's asking nothing more
[2:09:50] than for us to put all our faith and
[2:09:53] trust in him
[2:09:58] praise the Lord
[2:09:59] hallelujah or with the with the events
[2:10:02] of time and things that is happening
[2:10:04] around us and things that is happening
[2:10:06] in in around the message and all of that
[2:10:09] we we uh uh people get to worry about uh
[2:10:13] you know the Rapture and the bride you
[2:10:15] you are not the one that promised God a
[2:10:17] Rapture you didn't promise God you are
[2:10:19] glory in a Rapture is God that promised
[2:10:21] you that he's taking you in a rapture
[2:10:24] yeah
[2:10:27] praise the Lord Amen Let the I mean let
[2:10:31] let let let let the falling away comes
[2:10:34] there are as many as many that will fall
[2:10:36] away
[2:10:39] praise the Lord
[2:10:44] do you realize that even the rapture
[2:10:47] the promise of the Rapture do you
[2:10:49] realize that it's a reward
[2:10:57] do you realize that it's a reward that
[2:11:00] even the great Apostle Paul that talks
[2:11:03] about the rapture
[2:11:04] he was now rewarded to be caught up in a
[2:11:07] moment in a twinkling of an eye
[2:11:11] praise the Lord even the prophet that
[2:11:13] brought us the mystery of the revive of
[2:11:15] the rapture
[2:11:16] how the Rapture is in sequence there is
[2:11:19] a shout which is the message that comes
[2:11:22] to gather the people
[2:11:24] amen there is the voice of the archanger
[2:11:28] there is the of God
[2:11:31] which of course he make us to know those
[2:11:34] three things when Christ was descending
[2:11:37] those three things has been fulfilled we
[2:11:40] are in a circle even the one that
[2:11:42] brought us the mystery the understanding
[2:11:45] of the Rapture he was not rewarded with
[2:11:47] it
[2:11:49] then you think about it think about it
[2:11:52] think about it
[2:11:54] that when when when uh when Abraham was
[2:11:57] sending Eliza to go and get Rebecca oh
[2:12:00] my goodness I could just get into that
[2:12:03] man no I leave it
[2:12:06] praise the Lord oh I will leave it
[2:12:09] but when Abraham was sending me back I
[2:12:12] mean Eliza to go and get Rebecca I
[2:12:15] believe that he talked the best
[2:12:19] their best off
[2:12:24] the best of his Campbell
[2:12:28] amen
[2:12:30] that little truck that re Rebecca would
[2:12:33] sit down in and load all her things in
[2:12:36] it was made brand new
[2:12:40] it was a brand new one
[2:12:42] praise the Lord Hallelujah
[2:12:46] the same way you go we go and rent
[2:12:48] vehicles that we don't own for our
[2:12:50] wedding
[2:12:53] why because the wife is special
[2:12:56] amen
[2:13:01] praise the Lord
[2:13:07] let me leave that part of it let me go
[2:13:10] right ahead
[2:13:14] so the rapture
[2:13:17] it's a reward
[2:13:19] for a special group of people
[2:13:23] not not just for the church goal
[2:13:27] not just for the person that says I
[2:13:29] believe the message and Kiel and and
[2:13:31] care less about the Life of Christ or
[2:13:34] the reproach of Christ
[2:13:38] do you see why sometimes brother
[2:13:40] Barrymore says it would just be one from
[2:13:41] here one from there
[2:13:43] right he said with with things going on
[2:13:45] you look through the scripture how God
[2:13:46] have just taken a small group of people
[2:13:51] why because it's a a reward
[2:13:56] for a christ-like character
[2:14:01] praise the Lord
[2:14:13] glory be to God
[2:14:16] so you see that we have we have all of
[2:14:19] these things
[2:14:20] you know that uh that uh that are around
[2:14:23] here I share with you uh uh
[2:14:28] David and journey turn and then it's in
[2:14:31] first Samuel chapter 24 uh verse 21 that
[2:14:35] was word uh saw requested to David that
[2:14:38] he must swear unto him you know that uh
[2:14:41] he will be good onto his house they will
[2:14:43] also swear but it was it was not with an
[2:14:47] ought
[2:14:48] the importance here I was I was the
[2:14:51] emphasis that was coming to me it is
[2:14:53] that uh to us to us as human the the the
[2:14:57] value the value of of of making an odd
[2:15:02] like the scripture says his the Bible
[2:15:05] Paul says to men when you make an ALT
[2:15:08] it's the end of strife
[2:15:13] amen
[2:15:15] if you make a promise and and and and
[2:15:18] and put your life to it now you can you
[2:15:20] can you can talk everything and and says
[2:15:23] I will pay for this thing and there's a
[2:15:24] but when you take your character today
[2:15:29] praise the Lord you take your cartology
[2:15:32] and you put it down and says if I don't
[2:15:34] pay for it my yes yes maternity
[2:15:37] or you take your lady
[2:15:41] that's the end of strife
[2:15:44] that's how an odd is if you are just
[2:15:47] talking with your mouth it's just mouth
[2:15:49] talk
[2:15:51] they just mouth talk
[2:15:54] you know me you're my life I can promise
[2:15:57] you I will never just mouth talk
[2:16:00] to D down
[2:16:04] pour the title down the banquet gladly
[2:16:07] hold it for you
[2:16:08] foreign
[2:16:10] of strife
[2:16:14] is the end of strife
[2:16:17] I've been to this meeting I went to that
[2:16:19] river that just muffed talk
[2:16:21] but let the talking be applied let the
[2:16:25] blood Let The Life of Christ come on
[2:16:27] this place it's the end of strife
[2:16:34] praise the Lord
[2:16:42] Hallelujah
[2:16:44] is the end of strife
[2:16:48] the man make an ought
[2:16:52] so God
[2:16:56] when he was promising Abraham that he
[2:16:59] would have a seat
[2:17:01] he make an old
[2:17:03] the next time God will make an all to
[2:17:06] Abraham
[2:17:08] or the next time on Earth will be made
[2:17:10] it was when Abraham Genesis 24 when he
[2:17:14] was sending Eliza
[2:17:16] now so you see all the promises that are
[2:17:20] tied to Redemption
[2:17:22] God attached an ought to it
[2:17:28] he said he said Eliza take me by the
[2:17:30] time
[2:17:31] and promise me
[2:17:34] you're not going to make a shortcut yet
[2:17:39] amen
[2:17:42] those uh those days are you know that
[2:17:45] part of a man was the sacrifice of his
[2:17:47] body
[2:17:48] not this day where they are all all uh
[2:17:50] inbox are all on the street
[2:17:54] that was a sacred part of a man's body
[2:17:58] to tell him take me by the tide and
[2:18:00] promise me
[2:18:01] you will not take a woman out of the
[2:18:03] calendar but you go right home
[2:18:08] so la Iza has to bind himself that's the
[2:18:11] reason why it was important that's the
[2:18:13] reason why he stopped by the word and
[2:18:16] said Lord God
[2:18:17] [Music]
[2:18:20] because he knows he was honor and ought
[2:18:29] Abraham says unless the woman refused to
[2:18:31] come then you are released from the
[2:18:33] heart
[2:18:35] but just don't don't don't don't don't
[2:18:37] uh just want to satisfy me you go and
[2:18:40] pick up anybody no no no no no no no no
[2:18:45] so Ellie is a new the seriousness of
[2:18:47] what bound himself into
[2:18:52] praise the Lord
[2:18:53] that's why when Jesus on his way when he
[2:18:56] was saying Lord not my world in the
[2:18:58] Garden of Gethsemane but let your will
[2:19:00] be done he knew the seriousness
[2:19:06] he knew the seriousness for this purpose
[2:19:09] that he was born
[2:19:15] if we would just know the seriousness of
[2:19:17] what our being here this morning is
[2:19:21] not just plain religion it's not just
[2:19:24] making church member but this is a
[2:19:26] serious business
[2:19:35] God needing people that will live for
[2:19:37] the name of Jesus Christ
[2:19:39] that he would have his preeminence in
[2:19:45] praise the Lord
[2:19:51] the first uh a god of his purpose to
[2:19:54] manifest himself he did it
[2:19:59] the second one to find a body he found a
[2:20:01] man
[2:20:02] one man Christ Jesus
[2:20:05] but this time now is to find a people
[2:20:07] where he will have the preeminence
[2:20:09] people that will put God first
[2:20:16] that's why the Holy Ghost is Hungary
[2:20:18] forth that's why the Holy Ghost is
[2:20:20] slavery for
[2:20:22] people that will put God first
[2:20:26] and why can we realize that God wants us
[2:20:29] to put him first so he can bless us
[2:20:37] why can't we realize that
[2:20:39] amen when he even said try me
[2:20:43] try me if I will not open the windows of
[2:20:46] heaven so God is not doing it to punish
[2:20:49] you or to rob you of anything
[2:20:52] he wants to make you a peculiar people
[2:20:54] he wants to make you peculiar put me
[2:20:57] first I will make you peculiar
[2:21:02] brother man says show me a man that will
[2:21:04] pull God forever I will show you the man
[2:21:06] that is blessed in everything that he
[2:21:08] lays his hands on to do yeah
[2:21:12] yeah
[2:21:15] praise the Lord
[2:21:18] it is for our own good but our human
[2:21:21] nature struggle with that
[2:21:23] we struggle with faith that is that that
[2:21:25] is the slave nature in US
[2:21:28] we struggle with it
[2:21:31] praise the Lord I feel like I'm
[2:21:33] preaching to myself this morning
[2:21:35] amen
[2:21:37] don't feel bad it's not like I'm having
[2:21:39] resentment for you but there's a whole
[2:21:41] lot of a thing that I need
[2:21:44] glory be to God
[2:22:00] when God
[2:22:03] swore with an oath everything they have
[2:22:06] to do with Redemption
[2:22:09] everything
[2:22:11] God attached himself to it every promise
[2:22:16] if you if you if if you if you if you
[2:22:19] believe God's word and and uh and uh
[2:22:22] believe that he is able
[2:22:27] then take God at his word
[2:22:31] there is nothing too high for the Lord
[2:22:34] [Music]
[2:22:36] there is nothing too hard
[2:22:38] because even the least thing that
[2:22:40] concern us matter to him the most
[2:22:44] the least things that concern us matter
[2:22:47] to him the most but we we we we we make
[2:22:50] those things to overwhelm us
[2:22:54] how would I do it how would I get it
[2:22:56] done oh my oh my my life oh yeah
[2:23:00] and pretty soon we are so worked out
[2:23:03] that we have no time to live for our
[2:23:05] hairs up onto the Hills
[2:23:07] we're coming I will help
[2:23:17] glory be to God Revelation chapter 10
[2:23:19] let's close with that
[2:23:22] Revelation chapter 10
[2:23:50] Revelation chapter 10 when you read the
[2:23:52] book of Revelation it's just like the
[2:23:53] strong you will see here in verse 1 and
[2:23:56] I saw the mighty angel now that word end
[2:23:59] is is a conjunction a continuation of
[2:24:02] the statement from chapter nine and I
[2:24:04] saw the mighty Angel come down from
[2:24:06] heaven glow with with a cloud
[2:24:10] and a rainbow
[2:24:12] upon his head and his face was as it
[2:24:16] were the sun his feet as a pillow of
[2:24:18] fire now we get a second conjunction
[2:24:21] again and
[2:24:25] he had in his hands a little book
[2:24:28] and he
[2:24:30] said his right foot upon the seed in his
[2:24:33] left foot upon the Earth and then
[2:24:34] another conjunction again and
[2:24:38] and cry with a loud voice as when a lion
[2:24:42] Rolex
[2:24:44] and when he had cried seven Thunder
[2:24:46] altered their voices then another
[2:24:48] conjunction again
[2:24:49] and
[2:24:51] the seven Thunder and when the seventh
[2:24:54] Turner had altered their voices I was
[2:24:56] about to write
[2:24:58] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying
[2:25:01] unto mean seal of those
[2:25:03] those things which the seventh Turner
[2:25:05] altered and write them that another
[2:25:07] conjunction again and
[2:25:10] the angel which as I I saw stand upon
[2:25:14] the seed and upon the Earth lifted up
[2:25:17] His Hands to Heaven
[2:25:19] another
[2:25:21] conjunction again and swear
[2:25:27] praise the Lord now let me let me narrow
[2:25:30] this down God giving Abraham a promise
[2:25:36] of his seed
[2:25:39] which is tied to the promise of Genesis
[2:25:42] 3 15 the seed of the woman would bruise
[2:25:44] the head of the serpent
[2:25:46] praise the Lord
[2:25:47] so in that promise
[2:25:50] that's that's the promise of redemption
[2:25:53] so in the in the in the alpha the first
[2:25:56] promise of redemption God swear by
[2:25:58] himself
[2:26:01] that I will do this
[2:26:03] I will raise up a people for my name
[2:26:08] by you through you Abraham
[2:26:12] amen
[2:26:17] now here we're seeing in Revelation
[2:26:19] chapter 10
[2:26:20] at the closing of the book
[2:26:25] the same God that made Abraham
[2:26:28] and give him a promise
[2:26:31] it's coming down again
[2:26:33] in a form of Almighty injure
[2:26:37] praise the Lord
[2:26:39] amen hallelujah
[2:26:41] with one foot on the land and another
[2:26:43] foot on the sea
[2:26:45] and he's raising his hand again and he's
[2:26:48] swearing
[2:26:50] it's in a sense to say everything that I
[2:26:53] have promised everything that I've kept
[2:26:56] in the back part of my mind
[2:26:58] everything that I said I would do
[2:27:02] I have done it
[2:27:06] praise the Lord
[2:27:07] amen
[2:27:09] oh my
[2:27:11] God oh mine
[2:27:14] and he swear by him that liveth forever
[2:27:17] and ever
[2:27:19] who created God could not swear by
[2:27:22] anyone greater
[2:27:24] he swear by himself
[2:27:26] this Mighty injure is also swearing
[2:27:31] by him that liveth forever and ever
[2:27:34] the one that created the Heaven and all
[2:27:37] things that are there in
[2:27:41] here's the same one that swirl unto
[2:27:43] Abraham
[2:27:46] the same one that saw her by himself
[2:27:49] that after 400 years
[2:27:52] I will bring your people out on ego with
[2:27:55] the god did it he did it he says I would
[2:27:59] bring them back to this Lane then he
[2:28:02] brought them back to Kenya he did it
[2:28:04] then why do you think that God would
[2:28:06] promise to give you the Holy Ghost he
[2:28:07] can't give it to you amen praise the
[2:28:10] Lord why do you think that God will
[2:28:13] promise healing and he can't give it to
[2:28:14] you
[2:28:15] it's because of how much the value you
[2:28:18] have put to the promise
[2:28:20] the value that you have put to the
[2:28:22] ability of the one that have promised
[2:28:27] praise the Lord if I promise you a Jet
[2:28:30] Plane you don't believe it
[2:28:32] because I don't even have it
[2:28:36] praise the Lord why should you believe
[2:28:38] it say I believe it he's the man of God
[2:28:40] you get lying let me tell you now you
[2:28:43] believe me a lie
[2:28:46] praise the Lord
[2:28:48] amen
[2:28:51] Hallelujah
[2:28:53] glory be to God
[2:28:55] but I can promise you that I pray for
[2:28:57] you
[2:28:58] amen
[2:28:59] glory be to God I can promise you that
[2:29:02] just like Aaron where the breastplate on
[2:29:04] his heart I hold you dear to my heart
[2:29:06] and I left you before God every time I
[2:29:08] think about you
[2:29:18] and he lifts her up his hands to heaven
[2:29:20] and he swore by him that liveth forever
[2:29:23] and ever
[2:29:24] who created the heavens
[2:29:26] and the things that I did in the Earth
[2:29:30] and the things that are there in
[2:29:33] they see the things which are there in
[2:29:37] that there should be time no longer
[2:29:43] you read from verse one
[2:29:49] to verse 7.
[2:29:52] you realize that you have conjunctions
[2:29:54] of N and
[2:29:57] but then when you reach to verse 7
[2:30:00] apprecially it changes but
[2:30:10] praise the Lord
[2:30:13] amen oh glory be to God hallelujah
[2:30:17] am I making you to sleep
[2:30:20] Hallelujah
[2:30:21] but in the days of the voice of the
[2:30:24] seven angels
[2:30:27] in the days of the voice of the seven
[2:30:30] angel
[2:30:31] the one that swore by Heaven and Earth
[2:30:34] is telling us that in the day of the
[2:30:37] voice of the last Messenger right
[2:30:43] praise the Lord amen amen oh my goodness
[2:30:48] oh my goodness
[2:30:50] people why can't we see it well why why
[2:30:53] should it look like this message is a
[2:30:55] bondage to you
[2:30:57] this message is your freedom
[2:31:00] this message is the grace of God to you
[2:31:04] but in the days of the voice of the
[2:31:07] Seven Angels when he shall begin to
[2:31:10] sound have you heard the sounding of
[2:31:12] that angel have you heard the sounding
[2:31:15] of that angel
[2:31:17] praise the Lord you will even know the
[2:31:20] mystery of your life when you have heard
[2:31:23] that something you will know the mystery
[2:31:25] of your life you will know why

[2:35:38] to tie those loose ends
[2:35:42] praise the Lord tie those loose ends
[2:35:44] never even had a enough education to do
[2:35:46] that that's why God had to back him up
[2:35:49] with a supernatural gift
[2:35:56] yes praise the Lord
[2:36:01] if you have heard the voice
[2:36:04] of the seven angel
[2:36:06] you are honor and ought
[2:36:12] a
[2:36:13] you are honor and odd
[2:36:16] and if anything should go wrong you must
[2:36:19] hold yourself responsible
[2:36:24] if anything should go wrong you hold
[2:36:26] yourself responsible
[2:36:31] but he left his hands to heaven
[2:36:34] with one foot over the seed and one for
[2:36:36] on the earth and he swear
[2:36:39] by himself

[2:37:14] that they will be moving to New Albany
[2:37:17] when he have never heard that
[2:37:20] for God
[2:37:22] to be able to help him because I mean
[2:37:26] his family news is is a bad news father
[2:37:29] it's a drunk no good mean there and uh
[2:37:32] in the city that he live and all of that
[2:37:34] hmm
[2:37:37] the angel

[2:37:41] to help him to understand
[2:37:44] his life
[2:37:46] praise the Lord
[2:37:47] amen
[2:37:49] God is having more interest
[2:37:52] in helping you to understand the way
[2:37:54] he's dealing with you then you
[2:37:56] understanding the serpent seed God is
[2:38:00] having more interest to you for you to
[2:38:03] understand because when he gets you to
[2:38:05] understand he gets you involved in your
[2:38:08] own life the things he wants to do

[2:38:18] seventhana we first start for this honor
[2:38:20] honor honor understanding when it comes
[2:38:22] to our own life as soon as the devil

[2:38:44] of the Oracles of God
[2:38:48] praise the Lord
[2:38:51] it's the beginning
[2:38:53] of the Oracles of God
[2:39:04] that's what God had to swear
[2:39:07] by himself
[2:39:10] that's why he had to swear
[2:39:14] and make an odd
[2:39:21] he make an odd blessing I will bless you
[2:39:27] praise the Lord in blessing I will bless
