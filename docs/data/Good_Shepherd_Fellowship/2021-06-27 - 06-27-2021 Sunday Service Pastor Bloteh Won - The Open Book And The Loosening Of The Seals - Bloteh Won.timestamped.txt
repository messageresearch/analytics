[51:58] amen and according to his word that is
[52:02] exactly

[52:06] where two or three are gathered in his
[52:08] name there he is in the midst
[52:12] you come in his name i come in his name
[52:20] i greet you all in the name of the lord
[52:22] and savior jesus christ
[52:28] the opening scripture i think it was
[52:30] hebrews in chapter 11
[52:33] and it talked about faith and
[52:36] i can truly say that i stand here today
[52:38] by faith
[52:43] i i wasn't planning on being here today
[52:50] uh because of my job and the way it is
[52:52] and the way
[52:53] the way it panned out it's been really
[52:55] hard on me to get here
[52:57] every sunday i work a lot of hours i
[53:00] think i had
[53:01] like almost 80 hours last week and 80
[53:03] before that and
[53:04] 74 before that and it's really hard
[53:08] but by god's grace he's always allowed
[53:11] me to press through to get here
[53:13] every every every sunday since i've been
[53:15] here
[53:16] and so i spoke with a friend the other
[53:18] day and i told him i said you know
[53:21] everybody else that works they get a
[53:22] chance to get rest and i'm on the road
[53:24] going to church
[53:26] he said in my room my little room my
[53:29] apartment
[53:30] i mean just a disaster i mean just
[53:33] clothes
[53:33] everywhere and you know everything's
[53:36] clean
[53:36] but it's just you know i hadn't i never
[53:38] stopped take time to
[53:41] you know putting my things here and
[53:42] putting my just coming in and
[53:45] and uh so i said i was gonna stop today
[53:47] and i was gonna stop today and maybe
[53:49] stream services and
[53:51] take time and just you know see about
[53:53] see about me
[53:55] and um so he said yeah that's i think
[53:57] that may be a good idea
[53:59] and so that was friday and so saturday
[54:02] morning i woke up and an inspiration hit
[54:04] me
[54:05] and it says you know i got to get to
[54:09] church
[54:13] and uh you know nothing else matters in
[54:16] this world but being in god's presence
[54:19] and it's hard it's hard out there
[54:22] you know when you go to walmart when you
[54:24] go here and there
[54:26] and to find and be in his presence i
[54:29] mean there was a sermon that was
[54:30] preached here about
[54:31] how god cleaned us up and he washed our
[54:34] back
[54:34] and i remember that day god washed my
[54:36] back and he did a good job
[54:38] on it but then rubbing shoulders with
[54:41] the world throughout the week and
[54:43] and if i can't get here then i know
[54:45] what's going to happen
[54:47] you know because this is god's provided
[54:49] place this is where we come to get our
[54:51] power and our strength
[54:53] and i i encourage each of you do all you
[54:55] can
[54:56] to get to the house of god even if it
[54:59] kills you
[55:02] because i i'd rather god kill me then
[55:06] you know and so
[55:10] i got up and i packed my my little my
[55:12] little um car
[55:14] i said well you know i don't know how
[55:16] it's gonna work whether or not i'm just
[55:17] gonna drive all the way down
[55:19] or stop by the euro dolls i don't really
[55:22] know it just depends on what time we get
[55:24] off today
[55:24] i said but i'm going to church i'm not
[55:26] going to i'm not going to stop and
[55:28] and i just listened to a brother say if
[55:30] you take care
[55:32] of god's business got to take care of
[55:34] yours
[55:36] and and and and me coming here
[55:39] probably has a whole less a lot less to
[55:42] do with me
[55:43] than it is anything i don't really know
[55:46] how
[55:46] me coming here may affect you but
[55:49] i know me being here is really been a
[55:52] blessing
[55:53] and um
[55:57] and so so we had some accidents several
[56:02] accidents at work that i really thought
[56:04] that was gonna can
[56:05] our old job or our crew but it but
[56:08] it never happened and so and so
[56:12] we had an accident that happened that
[56:14] took place
[56:16] um friday and uh
[56:20] and uh but
[56:23] some kind of way you know god protected
[56:26] us and
[56:27] they they allowed us to remain and they
[56:30] fired one person instead of the whole
[56:31] crew
[56:32] and so um
[56:36] and so the next day was was this
[56:38] saturday in which i showed that i
[56:40] decided i wasn't going to let the devil
[56:42] hinder me from being in the house of god
[56:43] today
[56:45] and so that's when they told us first
[56:48] thing in the morning that we had to work
[56:50] today so my crew is working today
[56:56] and and so i i didn't get a wrong spirit
[56:59] i just praised god i said hey god knows
[57:02] and he knows and i went on and but
[57:05] before the end of the day
[57:06] panned it out my job was done
[57:10] i mean not just done for that day but
[57:12] done period
[57:14] and so and so it was disappointing
[57:16] because things didn't
[57:18] work out the way i planned um
[57:22] money money to be made i spend more
[57:24] money coming up here than i made
[57:26] you know and you know getting myself
[57:28] together but uh and so all of these all
[57:31] but you know all of a sudden i realized
[57:35] that god put something on my heart to be
[57:38] here this morning
[57:39] and so he'll bankrupt heaven
[57:43] to make sure that his word will not
[57:45] return to him void
[57:47] so if i if my job had to end however in
[57:50] the way it ended just for me to be here
[57:52] today
[57:53] glory to god and so i'm on my way now
[57:57] usually when my job's over with the
[57:59] first thing i want to do is get home to
[58:00] my wife
[58:03] i don't i'll drive 17 hours to get to my
[58:06] wife and she knows
[58:08] it and so when i when i packed up my car
[58:11] when i got off work
[58:12] i packed up my car i forgot all about
[58:14] that i had my suit
[58:16] already packed to come here my mind was
[58:18] going
[58:20] south and so my wife was on the phone
[58:24] and she went to talk and she went to
[58:25] saying you know baby um
[58:27] you know i don't really you know and i
[58:29] was just like
[58:30] i got to get off the phone you know
[58:35] i got to get out the phone so i got out
[58:36] the phone and i i relaxed myself
[58:39] i surrendered myself to god i i i
[58:42] surrendered my desires
[58:45] everything that i wanted i surrendered
[58:47] it to them right then
[58:48] and then something told me to call
[58:50] brother brooks
[58:52] so i called brother brooks and and i was
[58:54] just telling him some things that took
[58:55] place
[58:56] and so i asked him if i could pass by
[58:59] his way because
[59:00] i passed by his way on the way up here
[59:03] and so and so and i told him i said
[59:06] because i really want to come by and see
[59:09] i want to come to church today and so
[59:12] while we were talking and i had made up
[59:14] my mind through in the conversation
[59:17] that i was that i was that i was coming
[59:19] to church i was going to still make it
[59:21] to church
[59:22] regardless and right while i was
[59:24] speaking a bald eagle
[59:26] flew directly directly over the top of
[59:29] my car and had
[59:30] three eaglets behind it and it flew
[59:33] directly over my car and i'm on the
[59:34] phone and i'm like wow
[59:37] and so and so then you know and then we
[59:40] got
[59:40] the phone and before i called brother
[59:43] one
[59:44] you know um i'm gonna tell you
[59:48] uh if he ever got he weighed on you
[59:51] and issues you know when you get into
[59:54] the house of god
[59:55] he takes that away and and and and
[59:58] and this is the house of god as well but
[1:00:00] let me tell you something
[1:00:02] there's a little family that i visit
[1:00:04] brother your dog
[1:00:06] and they don't have to say nothing they
[1:00:08] don't have to tell me nothing
[1:00:09] i may not even see her when i get to her
[1:00:12] house he walks me in the door and sends
[1:00:14] me downstairs
[1:00:15] but when i enter into the house every
[1:00:18] time
[1:00:21] i i know i know i'm at home and i'm in a
[1:00:23] safe place
[1:00:24] and i'm talking about it all the cares
[1:00:27] and all the
[1:00:28] worries and all the problems and
[1:00:29] frustration they immediately dissipated
[1:00:32] just by stepping into their home so i
[1:00:36] don't know if you've ever been to their
[1:00:37] home if you got issues or whatever
[1:00:39] but i just say you better call them and
[1:00:41] say can we just come and spend a day at
[1:00:43] your house please
[1:00:45] you know it'd be worth the trip to going
[1:00:47] up there and seeing all that they have
[1:00:49] in the plants and
[1:00:51] you know the botany life that they have
[1:00:52] and that that they see about
[1:00:54] and i just want to say thank you for you
[1:00:57] know
[1:00:57] blessing me since i've been here and
[1:01:01] uh and so i i so then i called brother
[1:01:04] juan
[1:01:05] and i you know just told him what was
[1:01:07] going on
[1:01:09] and uh last night was last night was
[1:01:11] rough sleeping last night
[1:01:13] and uh but i got up this morning and
[1:01:16] my wife she just goes preaching and she
[1:01:19] goes to
[1:01:19] she's shouting and she's all happy and
[1:01:22] i'm glad you stopped and i
[1:01:25] you know she's just going on and on and
[1:01:27] and so i just knelt down to pray
[1:01:30] and um
[1:01:34] since i've been here i've made i've
[1:01:38] i've i've i've made a full surrenderance
[1:01:41] to the lord jesus christ
[1:01:43] i mean there's things in my life that
[1:01:45] i've held on to
[1:01:46] not necessarily simple things but the
[1:01:50] the way i was raised and
[1:01:53] the ways i was raised and some of the
[1:01:55] history that i have and
[1:01:57] i listened to a brother that says when
[1:01:58] you put on the whole arm of god
[1:02:00] you got to take off whatever clothes you
[1:02:03] got on
[1:02:04] where you come from you know where your
[1:02:06] character
[1:02:07] and how you are and the way your family
[1:02:09] raised you you got to let that stuff go
[1:02:12] that that stuff you can't have that on
[1:02:14] and have on the armor of god
[1:02:16] right you can't fight with god's armor
[1:02:18] and yours too
[1:02:19] right and you know since
[1:02:22] since i i'm since the day i've come here
[1:02:26] god has been god has been he's been
[1:02:27] peeling that stuff off of me peeling
[1:02:29] that stuff off
[1:02:30] my habits and my ways and my desires
[1:02:33] i had a chance to go down to
[1:02:36] when i first come come from the media
[1:02:39] here from first service
[1:02:41] something just kept pulling me down to
[1:02:43] the george floyd
[1:02:45] where the man got killed and i've never
[1:02:48] i've i've never i've never ever had any
[1:02:51] feelings about that
[1:02:53] you know as far as being a black person
[1:02:55] or anything like that
[1:02:57] and i've been around people that have
[1:02:58] just oh man just
[1:03:00] amazing how they got into the spirit of
[1:03:02] that thing
[1:03:03] and and i've always said well i've never
[1:03:05] seen nobody
[1:03:06] march around the crack houses i've never
[1:03:08] seen nobody march around at liquor
[1:03:10] stores and they've killed more people
[1:03:11] than anybody
[1:03:13] so let's let's have a million man march
[1:03:15] around liquor stores around the crack
[1:03:17] houses you know
[1:03:18] why you're not doing that you know
[1:03:20] that's right and so
[1:03:22] and so but something just kept pulling
[1:03:24] me i said what you know i don't want to
[1:03:26] go down there i don't you know
[1:03:28] i'm not even i'm not a black man i'm not
[1:03:31] a white man i'm
[1:03:32] i'm a son of god you know god god didn't
[1:03:36] god
[1:03:36] god didn't god didn't come down here to
[1:03:39] join a
[1:03:40] particular race god came down here to
[1:03:42] join to start his own race
[1:03:45] [Applause]
[1:03:52] and so because of the way i was raised
[1:03:56] and some of the things i've been through
[1:03:57] in my life
[1:03:58] it it caused me to have a callous in my
[1:04:00] hand
[1:04:01] against my own my own
[1:04:04] perhaps race of people and uh
[1:04:09] and it's just the way a lot of it is the
[1:04:11] way i was raised by my grandfather and
[1:04:13] it helped me to be able to
[1:04:15] to be able to get in a certain level in
[1:04:18] the industry in which i work
[1:04:20] because unless you're you know but
[1:04:22] anyway
[1:04:25] and so even that uh
[1:04:28] so i so i went down to the and took
[1:04:30] pictures and
[1:04:31] i couldn't believe how people that was
[1:04:33] coming all different nationalities of
[1:04:35] people that was coming
[1:04:36] and they was weeping over this over this
[1:04:39] you know
[1:04:40] over this this this place where this
[1:04:43] this this man died you know and
[1:04:46] it was just amazing to me and i'm just
[1:04:48] looking around at all these flowers and
[1:04:50] all these places
[1:04:52] and and so it just man it just it just
[1:04:54] really
[1:04:55] it made me really just take a look at
[1:04:57] look at me
[1:04:58] you know and um so i i come back and i
[1:05:02] come to service and um
[1:05:04] and i was staying in the hotel the
[1:05:06] brother had put me in the first time and
[1:05:09] i was
[1:05:09] i listened to this this um this app
[1:05:13] lifeline and the next morning brother
[1:05:16] branham he was speaking and he said that
[1:05:19] he said that um somewhere in chicago
[1:05:22] somebody got killed
[1:05:25] and uh how the people wouldn't walk over
[1:05:27] the spot where his blood was
[1:05:29] shed you know how they reversed that
[1:05:31] spot where his blood was shed
[1:05:33] he said he said he's saying it's amazing
[1:05:35] how we want reverence to spot
[1:05:37] of a man that died but yeah we'll walk
[1:05:39] over the blood of jesus christ
[1:05:41] every day you know and um
[1:05:44] and it was like wow okay i knew i was
[1:05:46] supposed to be here i know i was
[1:05:47] supposed to be here
[1:05:49] and so it helped me to come
[1:05:52] in contact with brother branham also
[1:05:55] said that he talked about jfk
[1:05:57] and he said that you know regardless the
[1:05:59] way he was being
[1:06:01] catholic or whatever and his demeanor
[1:06:03] and how
[1:06:04] women voted him in and all of these
[1:06:06] things the way we understand
[1:06:08] and he said but still no man had a right
[1:06:11] to die like that
[1:06:12] right and and even even this this george
[1:06:15] ford
[1:06:16] guy you know regardless of what kind of
[1:06:19] person he was
[1:06:20] no man had a right to die like that and
[1:06:22] so we live in a world
[1:06:24] that that that that that it talks about
[1:06:28] how
[1:06:29] how they'll die for how give your life
[1:06:31] for
[1:06:32] you know a sinner and perhaps even a
[1:06:35] righteous man
[1:06:36] but the way the way people are
[1:06:40] in the position to where they are even
[1:06:42] though we understand we're predestinated
[1:06:45] we understand we have the seals and we
[1:06:47] you know we're
[1:06:48] we're waiting on a rapture and so
[1:06:51] and and so and we understand that only
[1:06:54] to predestinate it
[1:06:55] you know or perhaps we'll make the
[1:06:57] rapture but then but
[1:06:59] but then there is a responsibility that
[1:07:01] we have
[1:07:02] as bride as christians to go out and
[1:07:06] witness and and to live
[1:07:07] lives to show because we have no idea
[1:07:11] whose bride and who's not that's right
[1:07:13] we have no idea who's
[1:07:15] so this this and i listened to this this
[1:07:18] preacher brother bill ivey he's
[1:07:19] preaching about
[1:07:21] i can't really pronounce what he said
[1:07:23] it's like sarticism but it talks about
[1:07:25] us for
[1:07:26] and no more okay so if it's
[1:07:30] us four and no more and if they're if
[1:07:32] we're waiting on a lost seed to come in
[1:07:35] then it can't be just us four it's got
[1:07:37] to be some more
[1:07:38] yeah and so and so and so and so i
[1:07:42] can't go out and witness to to
[1:07:45] some more if my heart is if there's no
[1:07:48] love in my heart
[1:07:51] i mean i gotta have i got because
[1:07:53] because christ died for me
[1:07:54] while i was smoking dope that's right
[1:07:58] christ died for for you and you know
[1:08:00] while we were yet sinners he died for us
[1:08:03] and so and so through that situation and
[1:08:06] through coming here
[1:08:08] god opened up a part of my heart that i
[1:08:10] didn't even know was locked
[1:08:12] and it was just a heart for for people
[1:08:15] that are not like me
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:18] and and and when you understand the
[1:08:20] thing
[1:08:21] you know how to deal with the thing and
[1:08:24] i just i just thank god for for how
[1:08:27] he's allowed me to come i mean every
[1:08:30] single step that i've come
[1:08:32] here has been supernatural super
[1:08:36] how they call me for the job how my
[1:08:38] place of residency was set up how
[1:08:41] your dogs were here i mean the minister
[1:08:44] you're
[1:08:44] the ministry that you have i mean
[1:08:48] i don't want to say you you don't know
[1:08:50] what you have
[1:08:52] i don't want to say that because i know
[1:08:53] i know that you do
[1:08:55] but i've been blessed to travel all over
[1:08:57] the united states and i've been to
[1:08:59] probably more
[1:09:00] churches i've been to a bunch of
[1:09:03] churches and i've met a lot of ministers
[1:09:05] and i've lit i've
[1:09:06] sit down a lot of pastor meetings and
[1:09:09] i've
[1:09:10] and
[1:09:15] you have an eagle here
[1:09:18] and uh and uh that's
[1:09:22] very very rare that's very very rare
[1:09:27] i know it's not about money it's not
[1:09:29] about prestige it's not about fame
[1:09:32] with him it's not it's purity
[1:09:36] it's purity it's purity only only an
[1:09:40] eagle recognize another ego
[1:09:41] right only only those that have been
[1:09:44] filled with the holy ghost
[1:09:46] can recognize those that have it
[1:09:51] and it's it's rare it's rare you find so
[1:09:54] many splits and so many
[1:09:56] separations in this message so many so
[1:09:59] many scruples and
[1:10:01] so many so many error
[1:10:04] and god allows error to come to split
[1:10:06] because if we're all in stuck in one
[1:10:08] spot
[1:10:08] the gospel can't be spread
[1:10:12] but man this the splits that caused this
[1:10:15] place to come
[1:10:16] man is is greatly divine
[1:10:19] it's greatly divine and i don't know
[1:10:23] where you're from and why you come here
[1:10:25] and how you ended up whether you were
[1:10:26] made to come here or not
[1:10:29] but i searched the scriptures as i was a
[1:10:31] methodist pastor
[1:10:34] in and out of prison and searching i
[1:10:38] ended up ended up with um i practiced
[1:10:41] islam
[1:10:43] i moved to utah and lived two years with
[1:10:46] the mormons
[1:10:48] and just on and on and on and finally i
[1:10:51] told god i said hey
[1:10:53] the methodists don't know you are the
[1:10:55] baptists don't know y'all the
[1:10:56] presbyterian don't know the other
[1:10:58] jehovah witness don't know
[1:10:59] everybody everybody look at the same
[1:11:01] book and see something different
[1:11:03] but you say you're one god yeah i say so
[1:11:06] you know what i'm done
[1:11:07] i know who the devil is he he he
[1:11:12] there's no confusion about who the devil
[1:11:14] is yeah
[1:11:15] so i told him i said hey i'm going until
[1:11:18] you finish this and
[1:11:19] and make this complete in my life i'm
[1:11:21] done so i sold myself over to the devil
[1:11:24] i went out and sold and
[1:11:26] i did everything that did that you know
[1:11:28] that the devil would
[1:11:29] you know everything and uh and
[1:11:32] and like i told you when i first got
[1:11:34] here january the 16th
[1:11:36] 2006 he showed up hey
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:44] i wasn't in church service i wasn't
[1:11:46] looking for god
[1:11:47] i i wasn't looking for for religion i
[1:11:50] would i was done
[1:11:51] i had been through that because you know
[1:11:53] when you know
[1:11:54] every every time when when this
[1:11:57] denomination or this religion
[1:11:59] starts out and they're good but as soon
[1:12:00] as they go left i'm gone because i i i
[1:12:03] understood the scriptures i knew what
[1:12:04] god placed in my heart
[1:12:06] before i was even born
[1:12:09] and so and so and so when i met him
[1:12:13] that day i was still out in the streets
[1:12:16] and i went
[1:12:16] right back but i but but my birthday
[1:12:19] fell
[1:12:20] in february of that same year which is
[1:12:23] the 28th which is the same day
[1:12:25] february 28th is the same day that that
[1:12:27] the picture was taken
[1:12:29] of the other angels and that's i mean
[1:12:31] that's that's divine to me
[1:12:33] you know i mean that's i mean you can't
[1:12:35] take that away from me that's my
[1:12:36] birthday
[1:12:37] you know what i mean
[1:12:41] you can't you can't take that i don't
[1:12:42] care you know i mean i've had preachers
[1:12:45] tell me
[1:12:45] man there's no way you got the holy
[1:12:47] ghost and you've done this and
[1:12:49] you've done that and i just tell them
[1:12:51] you know you might be true i might not
[1:12:52] have the holy ghost and i'll just say
[1:12:54] that today
[1:12:55] but whatever i got i'm gonna hold on to
[1:12:57] what i got into whatever it is
[1:13:00] and so and so and so my first first
[1:13:04] act of repentance was i had to turn
[1:13:06] myself in because i was on the run
[1:13:08] and so i turned myself into and it just
[1:13:10] happened the prison that they took me to
[1:13:12] i wasn't going to church i didn't heard
[1:13:14] t.d jakes and creflo dollars i've been
[1:13:16] through all of that i've been through
[1:13:18] all of that
[1:13:19] so i wasn't going to the church so i
[1:13:21] would go to the table and i was
[1:13:23] well i wouldn't even i wouldn't even
[1:13:25] really just
[1:13:26] i had my bible you know
[1:13:29] and i would just study because because
[1:13:31] because i met him
[1:13:33] it caused me to search again in the
[1:13:36] scriptures for god
[1:13:37] and so i so i opened the scriptures and
[1:13:40] i would read and i would go to
[1:13:42] i would go to the table and sit there at
[1:13:44] the table in a dormitory
[1:13:46] full of full of prisoners and um and so
[1:13:49] eventually people would start coming to
[1:13:51] sit down and ask me questions and ask me
[1:13:53] questions
[1:13:54] and ask me questions and i would just do
[1:13:55] this religiously at a certain time
[1:13:58] and and eventually it became a bible
[1:14:01] study
[1:14:01] i mean it became a big bible study and
[1:14:04] uh
[1:14:06] and so in our bible study this this one
[1:14:09] this one young guy he was on fire for
[1:14:11] god and
[1:14:13] and uh you know god was blessing me to
[1:14:15] teach him some things
[1:14:17] and uh and then all of a sudden he said
[1:14:19] man you you got he said but it's one
[1:14:21] thing you missing
[1:14:22] he said the bible say forsaken out the
[1:14:24] assembly of the gathering of yourself he
[1:14:26] said why you don't go to church
[1:14:28] and i explained to him he said well
[1:14:29] still you you still got to go to church
[1:14:32] you know and our prophet says you can't
[1:14:34] get to church you go somewhere
[1:14:35] and you know because he said he like uh
[1:14:37] cherry pie and then
[1:14:39] and so but anyway i had never even heard
[1:14:41] of brother branham at this time
[1:14:43] and so and so i went i went to this i
[1:14:46] went to
[1:14:47] so i said okay the next time you go to
[1:14:49] church service i'll go with you because
[1:14:51] he hit me with the word there was
[1:14:52] nothing i could do yeah i said well i'm
[1:14:54] gonna go to church i'm gonna go listen
[1:14:55] to
[1:14:56] some of this you know some of this what
[1:14:58] i've heard that ain't never helped me
[1:14:59] out i'm gonna go anyway
[1:15:01] and so i went this man was talking about
[1:15:03] uh eve having
[1:15:07] interactions uh with a monkey
[1:15:10] you know and i'm like man i never heard
[1:15:14] that before
[1:15:16] it was weird but i've heard everything
[1:15:19] else
[1:15:21] i've heard everything else so you know
[1:15:23] and nothing else stuck so now this is
[1:15:25] something that
[1:15:26] i didn't make sense but i never heard it
[1:15:28] before so every friday i
[1:15:30] i'd get up and go listen to this man
[1:15:32] because he was talking about something
[1:15:33] that i've never heard before
[1:15:36] and so and so and so there was a
[1:15:38] prisoner that was leaving
[1:15:41] he was leaving prison and uh
[1:15:44] he came to me and said man it's a lot of
[1:15:46] preachers in here and there's a lot of
[1:15:47] christians he said but you're the only
[1:15:49] one i see
[1:15:50] you don't smoke you don't gown but you
[1:15:52] don't get into any other things
[1:15:53] he said man i got these tracks he had
[1:15:55] been in prison for
[1:15:57] several years and he gave me this big
[1:15:59] old thing all these tracks and notes and
[1:16:01] stuff he had
[1:16:02] collected over the years so he said man
[1:16:05] i don't want to throw this stuff away
[1:16:07] so i'm gonna give it to you because i
[1:16:08] want you to have this
[1:16:10] you know i don't want to throw it away
[1:16:12] so i didn't want to cause an offense so
[1:16:14] i took it
[1:16:15] and i mean as soon as he hit the door i
[1:16:17] went straight to the trash can
[1:16:19] you know tower
[1:16:22] you know all of these things i just
[1:16:24] started chunking them in the
[1:16:25] chucking them in the mail chucking them
[1:16:27] in the trash can i was just throwing
[1:16:29] this stuff away
[1:16:30] all these religious tracks it was that
[1:16:32] he gave me and
[1:16:34] and and all of a sudden i looked at one
[1:16:38] and it says
[1:16:40] jesus christ is god
[1:16:44] i've said that all my
[1:16:47] i've life that even in the methodist
[1:16:49] church and people was like man he's not
[1:16:51] the he's he's the son of god
[1:16:53] but this said jesus christ is god and
[1:16:55] that's what i knew
[1:16:56] from here i've always known that
[1:17:00] you know but i couldn't explain it and
[1:17:02] so i grabbed that track
[1:17:04] and i set it to the side okay
[1:17:08] i started that chunky
[1:17:14] so so so out of all those tracks he gave
[1:17:18] me there was only one
[1:17:19] that i kept so i took that back and i
[1:17:22] opened it up and it talked about baptism
[1:17:23] and i still got that same trap too
[1:17:26] it's it's in one of my bags and um
[1:17:30] and uh and so i read it baptism well hey
[1:17:33] i got that because i have been baptized
[1:17:35] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:17:36] i've been baptizing a whole bunch of
[1:17:38] names
[1:17:40] but i but i had that when i had that
[1:17:42] open up under my belt
[1:17:43] i had that water and
[1:17:46] and so and so um and so
[1:17:50] so i they became so i i i and so i seen
[1:17:54] you know william branham named eroded
[1:17:57] and then i seen on the inside of it they
[1:17:59] had it had a stamp on they said evening
[1:18:01] like tabernacle
[1:18:02] which is a church where brother tim
[1:18:03] pruitt preaches down in mind in
[1:18:05] louisiana
[1:18:06] and um i was like okay
[1:18:10] you know so i'm going to this so i'm i
[1:18:12] got this and this almost became like my
[1:18:14] new little bible because it's something
[1:18:16] you know so now i got my bible and i got
[1:18:18] this right here and this
[1:18:19] my study with the focus is it on what i
[1:18:21] was what i was being taught
[1:18:23] here because it was something that was
[1:18:25] that was within me
[1:18:26] that was pulling me to this and so at
[1:18:29] the same time i'm going to the service
[1:18:31] about
[1:18:32] and so anyway all of a sudden this guy
[1:18:34] jumps from from that he goes over to
[1:18:36] uh church age he starts preaching about
[1:18:40] uh the first and second third fourth
[1:18:42] church ages
[1:18:43] and so and so i go to him i said man
[1:18:45] where you get this literature from
[1:18:46] where do you get this stuff from man
[1:18:48] well you know he said well i'm gonna
[1:18:50] bring you something so he brought me a
[1:18:51] church age book and a seal book
[1:18:54] and so and so i mean i opened up
[1:18:57] i think it was the church the seals book
[1:18:59] and the lingual
[1:19:01] the the the way it was written the
[1:19:03] language and how it was written
[1:19:05] i was like man this is like some kid
[1:19:08] wrote this you know what i'm saying all
[1:19:09] these broken english
[1:19:10] and how this guy got
[1:19:14] i mean what is this you know how you
[1:19:15] gonna get this to me i'm a methodist i'm
[1:19:17] a methodist
[1:19:29] i taught my mom's my mom's uh adult
[1:19:33] sunday school class at the age of 13
[1:19:35] years old
[1:19:36] because of the just i was just able to
[1:19:38] read the scriptures and give advance so
[1:19:40] but anyway but so i just kind of and so
[1:19:44] i ended up going to the back of the book
[1:19:46] both of them just because that's just me
[1:19:49] i'm hey i just go to the back
[1:19:51] you won't read the story let me just see
[1:19:53] how many i know how i begin let me just
[1:19:55] see how then
[1:19:56] all this stuff don't even matter so so
[1:19:59] so i got to the back of the book and and
[1:20:01] bam
[1:20:02] i seen a stamp in the back of the book
[1:20:04] it said even like tabernacle
[1:20:07] so this man that was preaching about
[1:20:09] these monkeys
[1:20:11] was the same was was come from the same
[1:20:14] church
[1:20:15] that passed out the tracks that said
[1:20:16] jesus christ is god
[1:20:19] and i say man i find another group
[1:20:22] i find another people i find something
[1:20:24] about another religion that i ain't
[1:20:25] never heard of you know what i'm saying
[1:20:27] i've been through everything else hey
[1:20:28] this is some i look i i and see i had
[1:20:31] seen god
[1:20:32] i had seen him face to face so i knew
[1:20:34] what i was looking for now
[1:20:35] i had seen him in the world i knew i was
[1:20:37] looking for but when i met him that day
[1:20:39] i knew
[1:20:39] i knew exactly who i i knew what i was
[1:20:41] looking for that's right
[1:20:43] i knew what i knew because that that was
[1:20:45] a former melchizedek that that i saw
[1:20:47] when mayor kennedy showed up everywhere
[1:20:49] all he did was show him
[1:20:51] the the perfect plan of god that he was
[1:20:53] going i can't i can't handle the word i
[1:20:55] can't i'm not going to pray
[1:20:57] i'm not going to preach and i don't i
[1:21:00] don't handle the word because of the way
[1:21:02] i'm married
[1:21:03] you know i don't i believe according to
[1:21:05] the message and according to what i've
[1:21:07] been taught that uh no man should handle
[1:21:08] the fire of god if he married to a woman
[1:21:10] that's been touched by another man
[1:21:12] so that's just that's just that's that's
[1:21:14] my thing i'm gonna stay with that
[1:21:16] what other people do that's that that's
[1:21:18] their business but anyway
[1:21:20] but i can still tell how the fire got
[1:21:22] lit so that's what i'm doing today
[1:21:26] so um man i just tell any young man and
[1:21:29] any young woman you know you keep
[1:21:31] yourself
[1:21:32] because there's a greater work for you
[1:21:33] to do down the road
[1:21:35] don't miss your life up to where you
[1:21:37] can't god can't use you in the fashion
[1:21:40] that he really want to use you so keep
[1:21:42] yourself clean
[1:21:43] it'll be better because if you're here
[1:21:46] because if you because
[1:21:48] yeah if if you end up if you
[1:21:51] end up with this power and you can't do
[1:21:54] nothing with it
[1:21:55] it's it's a burden on you it's a real
[1:21:58] burden but if you if you're free to be
[1:22:00] able to operate
[1:22:01] in the ministry that god can give you
[1:22:03] it'll it'll assure your relief
[1:22:06] just keep yourselves young man and um so
[1:22:10] so uh this brother this this this
[1:22:14] brother he was preaching
[1:22:15] and so i latched on to it i latched on
[1:22:18] to to the message and
[1:22:19] unless i didn't i didn't understand a
[1:22:21] lot of it you know i didn't understand a
[1:22:23] lot of it but i latched on to it
[1:22:25] and um and i ended up on now i was
[1:22:28] married before
[1:22:30] and my wife and i had divorced to be
[1:22:32] divorced and she remarried
[1:22:34] so this is kind of my story here bob and
[1:22:37] so she remarried
[1:22:38] and i that's when i married the streets
[1:22:42] and uh five years we were separated and
[1:22:45] she was remarried
[1:22:46] and so in this five years she got
[1:22:49] another divorce because he
[1:22:50] and i told him i said man you never when
[1:22:53] i first met my my
[1:22:55] my wife's uh anyway the dude she married
[1:22:59] i told him i looked and i said man
[1:23:01] you're never gonna be able to love her
[1:23:02] the way i do
[1:23:04] i said nobody can do that because this
[1:23:05] is my wife i told him that and i went on
[1:23:07] bible business
[1:23:08] and um and so you know when
[1:23:12] when god sends you a wife
[1:23:16] can't when god sends you one you don't
[1:23:18] have to worry about whether or not
[1:23:20] it's yours you'll never you'll never
[1:23:22] ever ever
[1:23:23] lose her either it don't matter if you
[1:23:25] try to stay by your side if she's the
[1:23:27] one
[1:23:28] that god sent you and so and so and so
[1:23:31] i'm going i go to prison and i get out
[1:23:33] of prison and so all of a sudden
[1:23:35] and i wanted to go to the church brother
[1:23:37] tim church but
[1:23:38] but but my friend the guy that preached
[1:23:40] that was ministering he said hey
[1:23:42] just stay where you're at until god
[1:23:45] moves you
[1:23:46] so i went back to the methodist church
[1:23:47] and before i know that i was a pastor
[1:23:50] i had two churches i mean just because
[1:23:53] of my
[1:23:54] and i was preaching the message what i
[1:23:56] understood about it you know
[1:23:58] and the people was like man they was
[1:23:59] just cause they you know
[1:24:01] they've heard these things that i'm
[1:24:02] speaking about you know i never
[1:24:04] mentioned brother branham i was just
[1:24:05] preaching some of these
[1:24:06] some of the mysteries that i that have
[1:24:08] been revealed to me
[1:24:10] and so and if i'd have kept on if i'd
[1:24:12] have kept on i'd be on television right
[1:24:14] now
[1:24:17] i'd be rich right now
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:21] i'd be i i'd be i'd pull up in a bentley
[1:24:23] this morning
[1:24:27] that's what they do but anyway
[1:24:30] and so and so um
[1:24:40] listen and so ended up my wife ended up
[1:24:42] when i first got out of prison
[1:24:44] my wife ended up bringing my kids to see
[1:24:46] me two boys
[1:24:48] and so it was a thanksgiving
[1:24:51] and uh in my and they asked me to say
[1:24:54] the prayer
[1:24:55] at home so i prayed and my wife said she
[1:24:57] heard something different
[1:24:59] and so we began to talk and uh i was
[1:25:02] in instead of getting into the uh
[1:25:06] the holiday with my family i steal away
[1:25:08] to my
[1:25:09] to my room and study because that's what
[1:25:11] i was doing in prison
[1:25:12] and so i was just studying and so she
[1:25:14] come looking for me wondering where i
[1:25:16] was at
[1:25:17] and i was studying so we began she said
[1:25:19] now we begin to talk about
[1:25:21] you know without the message that i
[1:25:24] understood
[1:25:26] and so it interests her and it opened up
[1:25:27] a door and so i began to build
[1:25:30] fellowship with my family and my kids
[1:25:31] again and so before i know it
[1:25:34] we got back remarried we've been battery
[1:25:37] married now for
[1:25:38] almost 18 years my wife and i have been
[1:25:40] together since
[1:25:41] we've been we've been together not
[1:25:43] together but
[1:25:45] for almost 30 years right now so
[1:25:48] and it's been better now than it's ever
[1:25:50] been ever ever been so
[1:25:53] that's one of the reason why i can't
[1:25:54] wait to get home so
[1:25:56] um so and so so so
[1:25:59] i introduced my wife to the message i
[1:26:01] started working
[1:26:02] and we got together and everything and
[1:26:05] so one day
[1:26:06] one day i come home from work man she's
[1:26:08] crying she's crying and i didn't know
[1:26:11] what was wrong what the problem was you
[1:26:12] know
[1:26:13] and uh she gave me she gave me a a book
[1:26:16] and it was a marriage and divorce
[1:26:20] and i had never read it before so i said
[1:26:22] okay well let me
[1:26:23] she said you need to read this so i
[1:26:25] listened to it i read it
[1:26:27] and i listened to it and i read it and
[1:26:29] he got down to
[1:26:30] correcting the situation i turned the
[1:26:32] tape off i said man i don't know what
[1:26:34] this man about to say
[1:26:36] you know if i'm about to divorce my wife
[1:26:39] again or what i'm about to do
[1:26:41] i said but but i knew vertebrae had been
[1:26:44] vindicated i was driving down the road
[1:26:46] at work and all of a sudden i would
[1:26:47] listen to absolute
[1:26:48] and this woman screamed and this message
[1:26:50] absolute and her scream went through my
[1:26:52] headphones
[1:26:53] like pouring milk all the way down and i
[1:26:55] looked in the mirror
[1:26:56] and i said it's true i found
[1:26:59] the messiah
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:02] i've searched through every kind of
[1:27:05] denomination you can think of
[1:27:08] and the only way god's going to come
[1:27:10] back for a bride do without spider-man
[1:27:12] he got to send a word is what i spotted
[1:27:14] not a methodist word not a baptist word
[1:27:16] not a presbyterian not a pentecostal
[1:27:18] word
[1:27:19] but a god word
[1:27:22] and a translation and an interpretation
[1:27:24] of god's word
[1:27:26] and god don't need nobody to interpret
[1:27:27] this where he interprets his own words
[1:27:30] and so and so and and and and and so
[1:27:33] you you're gonna follow some man you're
[1:27:35] gonna follow some man
[1:27:37] everybody i don't care who you are
[1:27:38] you're gonna follow some man but you
[1:27:40] look at the life of this man and you
[1:27:41] compare it to any other man
[1:27:43] that ever walked this planet you look at
[1:27:45] his life you read his life story you
[1:27:47] read william branham's life story
[1:27:49] and you and you challenge that to any
[1:27:51] other man in this world
[1:27:53] nobody's life for scratching not even
[1:27:56] right
[1:27:57] right on up to the life of paul or even
[1:27:59] the very life of jesus christ
[1:28:02] god god did more through brother
[1:28:04] branham's sinful flesh than he did
[1:28:05] through his own flesh
[1:28:07] in jesus christ so i'd rather take his
[1:28:10] advice
[1:28:11] than my own right i really take his
[1:28:14] device
[1:28:14] i ain't never seen t.d jakes or none of
[1:28:17] these people
[1:28:18] uh write in the fly leaf of your bible
[1:28:22] a little boy that's going to get crushed
[1:28:24] and feeling in england
[1:28:26] and then all of a sudden months later
[1:28:28] and he tells these people
[1:28:30] if this little boy he crushed by our car
[1:28:32] man
[1:28:33] if this little boy up on his feet in the
[1:28:35] next 10 minutes
[1:28:36] i'm a false prophet she saw a little boy
[1:28:40] playing you you yeah so somebody doing
[1:28:43] this right here i'm gonna listen to what
[1:28:45] they're talking about
[1:28:46] how about what i'm saying you you you
[1:28:48] listen to
[1:28:49] be because it was it was the sign it's
[1:28:52] the sign it was the sign
[1:28:53] that even moses that the guard gave to
[1:28:56] moses
[1:28:56] for the two i went from the following
[1:28:58] man out of each time i was going to
[1:29:00] leave
[1:29:00] pharaoh in the army and we're going to
[1:29:02] go across the bridge
[1:29:05] somebody like that but but he was
[1:29:06] working with something right that's
[1:29:08] right
[1:29:09] because they've seen the signs of the
[1:29:10] hand i think with them with the hand
[1:29:13] they come out of leprosy and they seem
[1:29:15] to the staff
[1:29:16] you know come up they're seeing these
[1:29:18] things so when you see people doing
[1:29:19] supernatural things these are people
[1:29:21] that you get behind
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:28] you know you listen to listen to these
[1:29:30] tapes and you hear brother brown
[1:29:32] oh your name is yeah i can't do it i
[1:29:35] mean i i would love to be able to say
[1:29:37] your name is
[1:29:38] lydia and you live at 1776. you know but
[1:29:41] i can't do that
[1:29:42] right but he did every time and it never
[1:29:45] missed that's that's the thing
[1:29:47] you got people mad people that hey find
[1:29:49] that you know find out his father having
[1:29:51] and we'll see her next week and then i
[1:29:53] don't know where she lives and you know
[1:29:54] you got people preachers that do that
[1:29:56] now they
[1:29:56] you know do all this whole fall stuff
[1:29:58] but this this was this was this was back
[1:30:00] in the 30s
[1:30:02] this was in the 40s they didn't have all
[1:30:03] this technology we have now where you
[1:30:05] can
[1:30:06] see people through satellites and all
[1:30:07] this stuff their images
[1:30:09] can't they couldn't do that so we knew
[1:30:11] it was real
[1:30:13] and so the pastor asked me you know to
[1:30:17] come and just tell what was on my heart
[1:30:19] and and maybe to encourage
[1:30:23] you know and uh even to encourage the
[1:30:25] believers and
[1:30:26] and the unbelievers even the
[1:30:29] make-believers
[1:30:31] because this is them three people exist
[1:30:33] inside of this church
[1:30:35] whether you're a believer an unbeliever
[1:30:37] or a mate believer
[1:30:39] all i can say is this message that we we
[1:30:42] believe
[1:30:43] and the prophet william branham he he is
[1:30:46] the
[1:30:46] noah of our day when noah was preaching
[1:30:49] get in the boat
[1:30:51] and everybody else was preaching all
[1:30:53] other kind of religion
[1:30:55] it was only one man that god ever uses
[1:30:58] only one man he ever uses at any time he
[1:31:01] never two prophets on earth at the same
[1:31:02] time
[1:31:03] never you can look at it through chris
[1:31:05] scripture and so
[1:31:08] as it was in the days
[1:31:12] so shall it be and so if he's coming
[1:31:14] back he got to send something he did in
[1:31:16] our day
[1:31:17] and we handled him we feel him every day
[1:31:20] and that same holy ghost amen the same
[1:31:23] holy ghost the same power
[1:31:25] that lived inside of by the william
[1:31:27] brown they live inside of mode the same
[1:31:29] light we look for pillow fire up in the
[1:31:31] sky
[1:31:31] no no no no it's right here it's right
[1:31:35] here
[1:31:36] it's right here so get to the house of
[1:31:40] god
[1:31:40] get into this message learn what it
[1:31:43] means
[1:31:44] believe it's true listen to the sign
[1:31:46] listen to listen to the listen to the
[1:31:48] voice
[1:31:49] of god through a prophet that speaks
[1:31:51] people's names out into existence
[1:31:54] and then and then once you realize that
[1:31:56] this is god's voice
[1:31:57] then all the other stuff don't do this
[1:31:59] and do that and do that do that
[1:32:02] you know it's god speaking to you
[1:32:05] and then it's easier to make a full
[1:32:07] surrender
[1:32:09] to surrender even your very eyes to god
[1:32:13] and when you make a full surrender to
[1:32:15] god
[1:32:16] it don't matter what the devil will
[1:32:17] throw you away
[1:32:19] there'll be an eagle gotta fly right
[1:32:22] across the top of your windshield
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:33] that he cares for you

[1:49:52] wanna check on it
[1:49:54] i knew that she will
[1:49:58] you know because it all comes down but
[1:50:00] uh
[1:50:02] the nature of her career and her
[1:50:04] personal nature
[1:50:06] and sometimes i would do that you know
[1:50:08] if i if i need some
[1:50:09] some historical things i call sister
[1:50:11] heavy assisted stuff please check on
[1:50:13] this for me
[1:50:14] whatever you get just send it to me you
[1:50:16] know so
[1:50:17] she has been a great resource to me and
[1:50:20] uh
[1:50:21] you know so uh she she called me
[1:50:25] and then she said you know she she said
[1:50:28] brother wanna really check on daddy you
[1:50:30] know and
[1:50:30] you know yeah and and then again she
[1:50:33] said
[1:50:34] uh do you know that uh
[1:50:37] i think uh uh tama
[1:50:41] you know uh one of the children of david
[1:50:43] named their daughter
[1:50:45] you know after tama
[1:50:48] and and uh
[1:50:51] you know and and that was that was a
[1:50:53] blessing and what happened is that uh
[1:50:55] you know i i wish of course i never even
[1:50:57] read that
[1:50:58] uh i didn't read you know going down and
[1:51:01] digging their history
[1:51:03] but then after we spoke a little bit it
[1:51:05] started being on my mind
[1:51:07] and then i says what i have to i have to
[1:51:09] i have to look at that
[1:51:11] you know and i went back and and i i
[1:51:13] searched upon it but then one
[1:51:15] session upon it reading it upon it then
[1:51:17] other things starts to open you know
[1:51:20] then the word just starts to open
[1:51:22] and you know and just and just start
[1:51:24] going on like that
[1:51:26] praise the lord but i mean it's right in
[1:51:28] the book of
[1:51:29] matthew chapter one matthew chapter one
[1:51:33] uh
[1:51:34] you know if you read there you will
[1:51:35] really see that uh the tenth
[1:51:38] from judah is david you know because
[1:51:42] this is the generation
[1:51:44] this is the book of the generation of
[1:51:46] jesus christ
[1:51:47] so if you if you read there you will
[1:51:50] find
[1:51:50] that the 10th you know from
[1:51:54] from judah is uh
[1:51:57] is is david
[1:52:01] and and the way machi wrote his book
[1:52:06] let's let's look at that the book of the
[1:52:08] generation of jesus christ
[1:52:11] the son of david the son of abraham
[1:52:14] why would matthew put david before
[1:52:17] abraham
[1:52:18] when abraham was before david
[1:52:23] is because the holy spirit here is going
[1:52:26] to
[1:52:27] address the kingship
[1:52:31] the holy spirit is going to major on the
[1:52:34] kingship
[1:52:38] praise the lord don't you think there is
[1:52:42] an
[1:52:42] error how can you put david before
[1:52:46] abraham
[1:52:54] so you see over and over
[1:52:58] the things that are written in the bible
[1:53:01] they are not just the concept of men
[1:53:07] there was a great intelligence a great
[1:53:10] divine
[1:53:10] intelligence they were inspiring those
[1:53:14] men
[1:53:15] for the things that they wrote
[1:53:19] abraham lived before david why should
[1:53:21] matthew says this
[1:53:23] and a person will read this bible and
[1:53:25] right here it would just be stumbled at
[1:53:27] this
[1:53:28] the son of david the son of abraham that
[1:53:30] he made a mistake no he did not made a
[1:53:32] mistake
[1:53:34] because the holy spirit honor matthew
[1:53:36] testimony
[1:53:38] was going to address jesus as a king
[1:53:44] and you will see them on the full gospel
[1:53:46] matthew
[1:53:47] is one of the persons that make emphasis
[1:53:50] on the kingdom
[1:53:52] of god because a king rules in a kingdom
[1:53:59] are we together the wise man
[1:54:02] matthew gave a testimony on that how
[1:54:04] they came to jesus even from his birth
[1:54:07] the crying in his king so you see that
[1:54:09] is the reason why
[1:54:10] the holy ghost designed this
[1:54:15] the son of david the son of abraham
[1:54:20] abraham beget isaac and isaac
[1:54:23] beget jacob and jacob beget judah
[1:54:27] and his brethren and then you read there
[1:54:30] from judah
[1:54:32] uh pharaohs
[1:54:39] you have judith and uh
[1:54:43] pharaohs and ex-roman aram
[1:54:47] and iran beget abinada and now but now
[1:54:50] that we get
[1:54:51] nessum and and he beget salman
[1:54:55] and samuel beget bores of ruth
[1:55:00] and the balls beget
[1:55:03] i know bores of rahab
[1:55:06] and boris beget obele of ruth and
[1:55:09] oberdiki
[1:55:10] jesse and jesse bkl david
[1:55:13] so that's the tenth from
[1:55:18] uh and what we were actually addressing
[1:55:21] the abroad of this whole subject is
[1:55:23] because uh
[1:55:24] uh judah has went into an abominable act
[1:55:29] with his with his daughter-in-law tama
[1:55:33] uh because uh tama disguised herself
[1:55:37] and and he said you know she's more
[1:55:40] righteous than
[1:55:41] i now so uh in addressing that
[1:55:46] we realized that that was the reason why
[1:55:50] the kingship was hell
[1:55:55] because judah under the prophecy of
[1:55:58] jacob he was promised the kingship
[1:56:03] that the scepter will always be in judah
[1:56:07] praise the lord so god never had a king
[1:56:13] until the time of david because when the
[1:56:17] people desire the king
[1:56:20] and and and and and the the the tenth
[1:56:23] generation has not come god gave them
[1:56:27] salt we know the story about that
[1:56:29] but david was a man after god's own
[1:56:32] heart
[1:56:34] so while i was looking at that then
[1:56:38] i realized also as we've been
[1:56:42] speaking for a period of time now taking
[1:56:44] these three gentile women
[1:56:46] that was ever placed in the uh you know
[1:56:49] in the genealogy is never like that in
[1:56:52] israel it's always the man the psalms
[1:56:54] women will be referred to when a son
[1:56:56] gave birth to days
[1:56:58] you know uh but yet uh we found that
[1:57:00] there are three women
[1:57:01] named tema and and rahab and boss
[1:57:05] their name is right here in the uh
[1:57:07] genealogy of jesus christ and then i
[1:57:10] started to look close and i says well
[1:57:13] you know
[1:57:17] if you look here you will see also
[1:57:21] that from abraham
[1:57:26] now you have to realize that boss
[1:57:30] married ruth and ruth background
[1:57:34] was from the two daughters of lord
[1:57:38] sleeping with their father which which
[1:57:40] of course is also an abominable act
[1:57:45] praise the lord so how kubos
[1:57:50] ignoring that the moabites
[1:57:53] ignoring their history how could boys
[1:57:56] go and take roof but if you look right
[1:57:59] in this very same
[1:58:02] uh uh genealogy
[1:58:06] you will realize that from abraham
[1:58:10] the 10th generation will come down to
[1:58:14] the general
[1:58:16] the married rehab
[1:58:20] uh what am i talking i'm kind of missing
[1:58:22] here now
[1:58:23] you realize that let me let me just stay
[1:58:25] right in place
[1:58:26] you realize that from
[1:58:30] abraham praise the lord
[1:58:34] now what i want to build you have to
[1:58:36] realize that abraham unlocked there were
[1:58:38] cursings
[1:58:40] amen so from the time that lord had that
[1:58:43] abominable ad with his daughters
[1:58:46] if you count 10th generation down
[1:58:49] you will get two boss
[1:58:52] so if you go from isaac jacob judas
[1:58:56] ferris you will come to boss
[1:59:00] and and and it's all stay in the
[1:59:02] commandment of god because it's just
[1:59:04] after 10 generations
[1:59:08] that there will ever be brought into the
[1:59:10] congregation
[1:59:12] so you see boaz was the 10th generation
[1:59:16] since their act was committed
[1:59:19] amen are we together
[1:59:23] amen praise the lord
[1:59:26] and then as i was looking at that also
[1:59:31] then i said to myself i said there's
[1:59:33] there has to be something about rahab
[1:59:35] also
[1:59:39] you know it's it's is it is this thing
[1:59:41] is it's kind of a funny
[1:59:43] i don't know whether you have
[1:59:44] experienced it but if i want to be
[1:59:45] earnest about you
[1:59:46] to you i will tell you that i've
[1:59:48] experienced it you're reading your bible
[1:59:49] and you get to those genealogy
[1:59:52] just a lot of names these are the
[1:59:53] sundays or some high names
[1:59:55] and sometimes it's so easy for you to
[1:59:57] think that
[1:59:58] you know let's just keep it adjust names
[2:00:04] but there is always a message
[2:00:10] sometimes god hides the simpliest thing
[2:00:16] if it was not important god will not put
[2:00:19] it in his book
[2:00:23] praise the lord so i stopped a while and
[2:00:27] i said well i have to look at this
[2:00:28] closely here
[2:00:30] because if we can bring tema uh i mean
[2:00:33] if we can bring
[2:00:34] david you know the tenth generation from
[2:00:37] uh
[2:00:37] from from from tema and and we can be
[2:00:40] able to bring
[2:00:41] ruth and then there should be something
[2:00:43] about
[2:00:44] rahab also so you will see that uh
[2:00:48] uh remember now
[2:00:51] it was from the time of abraham genesis
[2:00:53] chapter 15 where god make a covenant
[2:00:56] with abraham and says your seed shall
[2:00:58] shall join
[2:01:00] amen and i will come down with a mighty
[2:01:02] hand and bring them out
[2:01:04] he gave abraham a promise that he would
[2:01:06] bring them out into the land
[2:01:08] of canada yes sir to be dear lane
[2:01:11] amen praise the lord amen so if you look
[2:01:15] closely
[2:01:17] from abraham
[2:01:20] to to the the military general
[2:01:25] simon that married rahab
[2:01:28] is also 10th generation
[2:01:34] praise the lord it's 10th generation
[2:01:38] so you see uh uh uh
[2:01:41] just like i've said before joshua gave
[2:01:44] them an instruction
[2:01:46] to go around the city every day
[2:01:49] one time and how many times they went
[2:01:52] around the city
[2:01:54] seven times but the seventh time
[2:01:58] they had to go around it
[2:02:01] sixth time so you bring all the numbers
[2:02:04] out
[2:02:04] it's 13 and 13 is the number of a woman
[2:02:10] that's right and there was only one
[2:02:11] woman that was saved from that city
[2:02:17] praise the lord
[2:02:20] so you see there is
[2:02:23] this word of god like our brother said
[2:02:27] it's of no private interpretation
[2:02:32] there is a divine intelligence
[2:02:35] behind this book
[2:02:40] that's the reason why it remains they're
[2:02:44] unsatiable
[2:02:53] it does not means that you can't search
[2:02:55] it it means that you cannot exhaust
[2:03:00] you cannot exhaust searching this book
[2:03:07] you cannot exhaust it yeah every time
[2:03:09] you flip the page
[2:03:11] there's a voice to speak to you there is
[2:03:14] something that will come
[2:03:15] new that you have never seen you have
[2:03:18] never heard before
[2:03:21] that's right because this is god in
[2:03:24] print form
[2:03:25] that's right amen
[2:03:29] praise the lord yes sir
[2:03:35] so as i was looking at it and just just
[2:03:38] sitting there through the week
[2:03:40] you know i came across uh something that
[2:03:42] i've
[2:03:43] looked at and steady back before from a
[2:03:45] good uh
[2:03:46] a hebrew friend of mine you know uh uh
[2:03:50] and uh he actually made me to look at
[2:03:55] look at genealogy very closely and the
[2:03:57] message that would behave in it
[2:04:00] years back i saw that but i i never
[2:04:04] i never got into the death about it
[2:04:06] because you read some stories
[2:04:08] in the book of uh uh like even if you
[2:04:12] read let me let me give you on another
[2:04:13] assignment
[2:04:14] so you can check it out you read in the
[2:04:17] book of
[2:04:18] first samuel and first time you talk
[2:04:21] about
[2:04:22] the sounds of eli and what they did
[2:04:26] and and it also talked about the sons
[2:04:31] of of samuel praise the lord
[2:04:35] but it tells us the end
[2:04:38] of the songs of eli and never said
[2:04:42] nothing about the songs of samuel
[2:04:46] until you come to the chronicles
[2:04:49] then you realize the sounds of samia
[2:04:53] they repented and they were brought into
[2:04:58] their work with ahabs
[2:05:01] or assaf
[2:05:04] praise the lord you find them
[2:05:08] serving in the principle
[2:05:12] so you see some of those things god just
[2:05:15] designed it like that
[2:05:16] yeah think about it also why the bible
[2:05:19] is not
[2:05:20] written in a chronological way
[2:05:24] right from the garden of eden and to
[2:05:27] just the way things happen
[2:05:29] but it's kind of a split out that
[2:05:32] nehemiah's and ezra talk about the
[2:05:34] rebuilding
[2:05:35] and the prophets that was with them
[2:05:38] hegel
[2:05:39] zechariah's mother that comes to the end
[2:05:42] of the old testament
[2:05:44] all of those prophets were right in the
[2:05:46] time of nehemiah's
[2:05:47] in ezra yeah why the bible did not just
[2:05:50] make it so easy
[2:05:51] because it's not the words of man amen
[2:05:55] it takes revelation
[2:05:58] isaiah said yeah a little and dare a
[2:06:01] little
[2:06:02] girl praise the lord
[2:06:06] sometimes people read through the bible
[2:06:08] and it says i i get confused because uh
[2:06:10] uh uh it's all because it's not
[2:06:13] something that you can learn
[2:06:15] amen amen
[2:06:18] it's now for you to learn and master
[2:06:21] yeah
[2:06:21] it's something that want to become part
[2:06:23] of your life
[2:06:30] praise the lord amen so as i got into
[2:06:34] this whole
[2:06:35] generation thing i want to take you to
[2:06:38] the book of
[2:06:40] genesis chapter 5.
[2:06:44] praise the lord amen
[2:06:47] i mean god has spoken let the church say
[2:06:49] amen
[2:06:51] praise the lord amen our brother
[2:06:54] testimony was just a blessing
[2:06:57] so uh
[2:07:00] i'm just trying to come behind it amen
[2:07:05] the enemy tried to fight me all through
[2:07:07] the week i'm telling you
[2:07:09] yesterday at that finger of my head was
[2:07:11] just pounding me
[2:07:13] and i came here and you know
[2:07:17] tried to try to rest him prayed and
[2:07:20] man i just couldn't get through it slept
[2:07:22] woke up around 3 a.m in the morning i
[2:07:25] said glory be to god i jump out oh i'm
[2:07:27] feeling so fine
[2:07:28] just driving to church i start feeling
[2:07:31] the pain in my head so
[2:07:33] praise the lord but it's all because god
[2:07:36] had a way to speak to us
[2:07:38] amen so we just appreciate our lord
[2:07:41] uh for having our brother you know bring
[2:07:44] that now you guess to genesis chapter
[2:07:46] five he also tells us
[2:07:48] that this is the book of the generation
[2:07:50] of adam
[2:07:53] in the day that god created man in his
[2:07:57] likeness
[2:07:58] in the likeness of god may he him now it
[2:08:01] brings
[2:08:02] us to another generation
[2:08:05] now like i said before talking about the
[2:08:07] generation of jesus christ and the
[2:08:09] revelation of jesus christ
[2:08:11] there is a history that is
[2:08:15] that is hidden in every generation
[2:08:18] in your generation there is a history
[2:08:22] in a generation of this country it is a
[2:08:24] history
[2:08:25] in every generation there is a history
[2:08:29] praise the lord now it says here the
[2:08:32] generation of jesus christ glory be to
[2:08:36] god
[2:08:37] are we together before we do that
[2:08:42] let's go to the book of jude
[2:08:46] let's go to the book of jude
[2:08:51] sometimes just like i said you get to
[2:08:53] the book of uh of genesis
[2:08:56] you read the the the beginning
[2:08:59] of the creation of the word you read
[2:09:01] adam and eve you get to genesis chapter
[2:09:03] 4
[2:09:04] king kill abel in genesis chapter 5 is
[2:09:07] just a bunch of names
[2:09:08] and then you jump over here and get
[2:09:10] right to genesis chapter 6
[2:09:12] when god called noah but i want us to
[2:09:15] look at something here
[2:09:17] very closely jude the 14th verse there
[2:09:19] is only one chapter there the 14th verse
[2:09:22] says
[2:09:23] and enoch also
[2:09:26] the seventh from adam
[2:09:30] praise the lord now the bible says enoch
[2:09:33] the seventh from adam
[2:09:35] i mean if if you really own a conviction
[2:09:38] reading the word you will have to stop
[2:09:40] and to really get there you have to go
[2:09:42] to genesis chapter five
[2:09:44] and count from adam to enoch
[2:09:49] praise the lord now so if you count from
[2:09:52] adam to enoch
[2:09:54] what is hating in this message
[2:09:57] enoch the seven from adam it kicks
[2:10:01] king out
[2:10:04] a proof by this that king was not
[2:10:07] in the line of of adam
[2:10:12] so enoch the seven from adam
[2:10:16] will be adam seth that replaced
[2:10:20] a bell that was killed
[2:10:24] are we together and enos and kana and
[2:10:28] malhila and and joel and enoch will be
[2:10:30] the seventh
[2:10:32] from adam are we together
[2:10:35] watch another thing again
[2:10:39] and he not also the seven from adam
[2:10:42] prophesy this
[2:10:45] saying behold
[2:10:49] the lord cometh
[2:10:54] so inna was a prophet
[2:10:58] amen he prophesied about
[2:11:01] the coming of the lord
[2:11:05] the coming of the lord jesus christ
[2:11:10] and the prophet said go on and say
[2:11:13] behold the lord
[2:11:15] cometh
[2:11:18] with ten thousands
[2:11:22] of his sins praise the lord
[2:11:27] now so you can also see there in genesis
[2:11:30] chapter 5
[2:11:32] you can see in a prophecy because before
[2:11:36] the floor came
[2:11:38] this was four generations and we know
[2:11:40] what fourth generation means
[2:11:43] abraham isaac and
[2:11:47] abraham isaac and jacob
[2:11:51] praise the lord and then the patriot
[2:11:54] joseph and his brethren
[2:11:55] you know that makes the full generation
[2:11:59] four generation we all we all we we we
[2:12:02] see that through the scripture
[2:12:04] and realize have been talked about a
[2:12:05] prophet that's
[2:12:07] that's when god starts watching over an
[2:12:10] event
[2:12:14] god started watching and started being
[2:12:16] interested in you
[2:12:18] from your fourth generation back
[2:12:21] because fall is the number of
[2:12:23] deliverance
[2:12:25] praise the lord but this is what i wanna
[2:12:28] i want to bring us talk
[2:12:29] as we look at this together in the
[2:12:31] scripture if you go back to the bible
[2:12:34] and you see enoch the seventh from adam
[2:12:38] you will realize from enoch to noah
[2:12:41] is four generation
[2:12:45] praise the lord from adam
[2:12:49] to noah is 10th generation
[2:12:53] praise the lord amen just follow me here
[2:12:57] it will it will there is something about
[2:13:00] this number 10
[2:13:01] you know in the scripture the number 10
[2:13:04] is the number of
[2:13:05] election is the number of elections
[2:13:10] an election is when god elects or god
[2:13:13] set a thing aside
[2:13:15] and that's the reason why the children
[2:13:17] of israel were
[2:13:18] were told to bring their tenth onto the
[2:13:21] lord
[2:13:23] amen which comes under the principle of
[2:13:27] tithing
[2:13:28] and as i was just saying this you know i
[2:13:30] was thinking about it
[2:13:32] and and you realize that uh you know
[2:13:35] people talks about the principle of
[2:13:37] tithing
[2:13:38] and where a install is just money
[2:13:43] you know but the the principle of
[2:13:45] tithing is not just
[2:13:47] on the money amen because even
[2:13:50] god told the children of israel that the
[2:13:53] land should rest
[2:13:57] amen after they have gone through a time
[2:14:00] of farming and harvest
[2:14:02] they must have a time of rest
[2:14:06] so the tiding goes back and connects to
[2:14:09] the sabbath
[2:14:13] praise the lord amen now so you will
[2:14:17] realize that as i was just thinking
[2:14:19] about this
[2:14:19] i i taught about it you know and and the
[2:14:23] scriptures
[2:14:23] you know uh that that line of the tenth
[2:14:27] was just in everything
[2:14:30] in everything and i also believe
[2:14:35] it's in the 24 hours that god gave us
[2:14:42] we have to give him a time of the 24
[2:14:45] hours
[2:14:50] it come up to two hours
[2:14:54] maybe about 40 minutes
[2:15:00] god expects you to give him two hours
[2:15:02] and 40 minutes
[2:15:04] if you want to keep to the lord
[2:15:08] two hours and 40 minutes of your every
[2:15:11] day
[2:15:17] it's not just sitting down two hours and
[2:15:19] 40 minutes being confused and don't know
[2:15:21] what to do
[2:15:24] praise the lord
[2:15:27] amen well in whichever way that god will
[2:15:30] deal with you
[2:15:31] and if you realize it as a child of god
[2:15:34] you will realize
[2:15:35] that your worship your prayers your
[2:15:38] meditation
[2:15:39] in the day that you do unconsciously
[2:15:44] if you bring it together
[2:15:49] you might either give god a correct tie
[2:15:52] or you might cheat god on your time
[2:15:54] like people do with money so you see
[2:15:57] it's a principle
[2:15:59] it's a principle if you just lay it down
[2:16:03] to a law
[2:16:04] it becomes a religion when a person just
[2:16:07] pay
[2:16:08] you know detain from their check it
[2:16:10] becomes a religion it's
[2:16:12] principles are something that's supposed
[2:16:14] to be part of our life
[2:16:16] amen now even if you don't have money
[2:16:19] you have something to give us a tie
[2:16:22] you all god tends in everything that you
[2:16:25] have amen
[2:16:32] praise the lord
[2:16:36] even before the law the commandment was
[2:16:39] written
[2:16:40] and god through the prophet moses gave
[2:16:42] the people
[2:16:43] the stature go back and see god meeting
[2:16:46] abraham
[2:16:49] he came down and met abraham
[2:16:52] after abraham has on his house
[2:16:56] to go after his fallen brother looked
[2:17:03] machized came down to serve communion to
[2:17:08] abraham
[2:17:09] and the bible says abraham gave him a
[2:17:13] tenth
[2:17:16] praise the lord so this is not just
[2:17:20] uh uh an old testament you know uh
[2:17:23] thing that we tied to the church and
[2:17:25] pool on people for money
[2:17:27] i personally believe that it has to be a
[2:17:29] revelation to you
[2:17:30] if it does not if it is not a revelation
[2:17:33] that i mean there is no way i can help
[2:17:35] you
[2:17:37] amen i'm not going to be running behind
[2:17:40] you you pay your time you pay your tithe
[2:17:42] i i get a whole bible to preach from
[2:17:46] i get a whole bible to preach from
[2:17:51] praise the lord amen then to be hunting
[2:17:55] you down for money
[2:17:57] if god cannot take care of me praise the
[2:18:00] lord
[2:18:01] if he cannot take care of me then
[2:18:04] uh praise the lord
[2:18:08] you know so that's that's the principle
[2:18:10] here and you see
[2:18:12] it in these in this in this generation
[2:18:15] how god is bringing out something here
[2:18:18] but let me show you something
[2:18:19] amen and just just to encourage you
[2:18:22] praise the lord so we we realized that
[2:18:25] enough was the seventh from
[2:18:27] adam it teach us a lesson there and
[2:18:29] enough also prophesied
[2:18:31] about the coming of the lord how did he
[2:18:33] prophesy
[2:18:35] in our prophesied when he had his son
[2:18:39] mentula
[2:18:43] amen so even the floor of noah
[2:18:47] was part of enoch prophecy
[2:18:57] he names him benthusila and in the
[2:19:00] hebrew
[2:19:01] mentisla means his death
[2:19:05] shall bring
[2:19:10] his death shall bring
[2:19:15] now you will realize why god kept this
[2:19:18] man for 900
[2:19:20] and some more years because right after
[2:19:23] he died
[2:19:24] there will be a judgment
[2:19:30] praise the lord if death
[2:19:34] shall break you see the hebrew
[2:19:38] as we know the the hebrew mothers on a
[2:19:41] prof on
[2:19:42] on an inspiration named their children
[2:19:44] whenever they were in birth pains
[2:19:46] and whatever name that mother would cry
[2:19:48] out or whatever she would cry out
[2:19:50] would turn to influence that child life
[2:19:53] so
[2:19:54] uh the hebrews don't look at names like
[2:19:57] the way we look at it
[2:19:59] every name is very very significant
[2:20:02] amen every name of a child
[2:20:06] is either something that god was doing
[2:20:08] in the family or the time that family
[2:20:10] was going through
[2:20:11] some trial of the lord or something was
[2:20:12] happening
[2:20:14] praise the lord
[2:20:18] so you can see that right
[2:20:22] from the time of enoch
[2:20:28] and god was using this man like the
[2:20:31] scripture said he walked with god
[2:20:35] and things he was saying
[2:20:38] just like job of his days the bible says
[2:20:41] job would get in the marketplace
[2:20:43] and people would come to job and ask him
[2:20:46] for counsel
[2:20:51] those were men that people could tell by
[2:20:53] their life
[2:20:54] there was something special about them
[2:20:58] so enough name his son mantusila
[2:21:03] praise the lord can you imagine
[2:21:08] like my friend chuck says he said can
[2:21:10] you imagine
[2:21:12] when that child had a fever
[2:21:18] knowing that his death
[2:21:22] shall break
[2:21:26] at joshua
[2:21:29] when he had a fever the whole time was
[2:21:32] concerned
[2:21:37] everybody was kind to him yeah
[2:21:41] everybody loved mentula
[2:21:47] because the new dead his life not only
[2:21:51] his name
[2:21:53] his life had a very
[2:21:56] significance
[2:22:00] are we together praise the lord
[2:22:05] now so you think about this
[2:22:09] even the the the jews they still
[2:22:13] struggle
[2:22:15] until god opened their eyes to be able
[2:22:18] to see the plan of redemption
[2:22:21] they altered us jews still struggle to
[2:22:23] embrace
[2:22:24] our lord jesus christ as their messiah
[2:22:28] they know that their messiah had to be
[2:22:30] god in flesh
[2:22:32] praise the lord amen but yet they still
[2:22:35] struggle
[2:22:37] but think about this hundreds of years
[2:22:41] before jesus came to the earth
[2:22:48] and this is from the hebrew
[2:22:52] you know after the babylonian captivity
[2:22:58] gentiles started being involved god
[2:23:01] started using different gentile kings
[2:23:04] you know like we know in the scripture
[2:23:06] cyrus and
[2:23:07] in the different ones of them gentiles
[2:23:09] started getting involved
[2:23:10] but the hebrew language got a change
[2:23:15] before then the hebrew language the
[2:23:17] original hebrew language
[2:23:19] was was was more like
[2:23:22] every letter had a significance you know
[2:23:25] it had a drawing
[2:23:27] you know that identified that letter but
[2:23:29] after the babylonian
[2:23:31] captivity the hebrew that's when it took
[2:23:34] the box form
[2:23:35] you know the box forming ship that it
[2:23:37] has
[2:23:38] but so this is back if you go back and
[2:23:41] check this
[2:23:42] the root there in the hebrew you will
[2:23:44] realize
[2:23:46] that there was a message
[2:23:49] of the messiah that was hidden
[2:23:53] in the names of the genealogy
[2:23:56] right from adam to
[2:24:00] noah adam will mean
[2:24:04] a man and
[2:24:07] said means appointed
[2:24:11] in genesis 4 25 eve said
[2:24:15] god has appointed me another son
[2:24:18] instead of king in instead of ibel
[2:24:22] all kings kill
[2:24:25] said means appointed
[2:24:29] inners means it means
[2:24:35] mortal afraid or
[2:24:38] mortal miserableness
[2:24:44] that's what her name means
[2:24:49] kenneth means sorrow
[2:25:00] means either the praise god
[2:25:04] or the blessed god because you see the
[2:25:07] el at the end
[2:25:10] l means god
[2:25:16] and jail will means come shall come down
[2:25:20] enoch means teaching
[2:25:25] mantusula means his death shall bring
[2:25:30] lamech means
[2:25:33] that's where the word lamentation is
[2:25:36] taken from
[2:25:38] the root word lamentation comes from
[2:25:40] that word lamech it means
[2:25:41] lamentation or it means despairing
[2:25:46] and noah according to genesis chapter 5
[2:25:50] verse 29
[2:25:51] it means comfort
[2:25:54] praise the lord so if you just
[2:25:58] take your time and read through those
[2:26:02] names
[2:26:02] and the meaning of their names
[2:26:06] man appointed mortal frail
[2:26:11] or mortal miserableness
[2:26:14] that we end in sorrow
[2:26:18] but the blessed god shall come down
[2:26:26] and his teaching
[2:26:32] the blessed god shall come down teaching
[2:26:36] his death shall bring
[2:26:40] despairing and comfort
[2:26:49] the bible says
[2:26:54] in a prophesy praise the lord
[2:26:58] you know i just got caught up in these
[2:27:00] generations things
[2:27:04] but you think about it think about
[2:27:08] it
[2:27:12] that the coming of the lord jesus
[2:27:18] man is appointed
[2:27:22] mortar fail
[2:27:27] that would bring sorrow job said it
[2:27:31] he's a man of few days and full of
[2:27:34] trouble
[2:27:37] man is appointed paul picks that up he
[2:27:40] said disappointed unto men wants to die
[2:27:43] man
[2:27:44] is appointed that's all we can get out
[2:27:48] of this life
[2:27:51] man is appointed mortal thrill
[2:27:57] but the blessed god shall come down
[2:28:01] amen
[2:28:08] the blessed god shall come down teaching
[2:28:14] and his death
[2:28:17] will bring us
[2:28:20] despairing and comfort
[2:28:26] praise the lord
[2:28:32] you don't need a theological argument to
[2:28:34] prove that jesus is
[2:28:39] that's god you don't need a theological
[2:28:42] argument
[2:28:43] because it's written right here amen
[2:28:49] praise the lord
[2:28:52] and this is in the original hebrew
[2:28:58] even in their own language is
[2:29:01] prophesying
[2:29:03] that god shall come down and his
[2:29:06] death that's one of the things that the
[2:29:09] hebrews struggle with
[2:29:10] isaiah 53 the struggle with isaiah 53
[2:29:16] because isaiah 53 described his death
[2:29:25] are we together i'll just
[2:29:29] share these things with you because
[2:29:30] sometimes that's some of the things i
[2:29:32] get caught up in
[2:29:35] but this morning last week we were
[2:29:37] talking about the opening of the book
[2:29:39] and the loosing of the seals
[2:29:41] i just want to bring something to you
[2:29:44] from there
[2:29:45] and why i think it's very important
[2:29:48] praise the lord it's very very important
[2:29:52] you know because just like our brother
[2:29:55] testified
[2:29:57] we read here from going beyond the camp
[2:30:00] and listening to this as allah can
[2:30:03] preach across the nation i watch the
[2:30:05] people
[2:30:06] i'm fully persuaded that people are not
[2:30:09] getting to christ
[2:30:12] and i believe that is the enemy
[2:30:15] that's throwing this hindrance
[2:30:19] because the reason i believe this he is
[2:30:22] not the object that they
[2:30:25] are pointed to
[2:30:28] christ the living word the resurrected
[2:30:32] christ jesus
[2:30:34] he is the object that we worship amen
[2:30:38] the word god means an object
[2:30:41] of worship every worship must have an
[2:30:45] object that you are striving that
[2:30:48] worship tool
[2:30:50] and the one that we worship in this
[2:30:52] building is nothing but this word
[2:30:55] coming out of the pages and becoming
[2:30:58] real to you oh may god help me not to
[2:31:02] give you anything
[2:31:04] then this word coming out of the pages
[2:31:11] but people are not getting to christ
[2:31:14] they want to join a church
[2:31:17] they want a religion that they can
[2:31:20] accept
[2:31:22] and that is popular
[2:31:27] because he's not the object that they
[2:31:29] are pointed to
[2:31:31] they have either been pointed to a dogma
[2:31:34] a doctrine
[2:31:36] a party an experience a sensation
[2:31:39] you know my body's shaking and all of
[2:31:41] that is argued
[2:31:44] but don't stop at that experience don't
[2:31:47] stop at that sensation
[2:31:49] let christ become real and the person to
[2:31:52] you
[2:31:53] amen not just that day but every day of
[2:31:56] your life
[2:31:58] that's right because he's a living
[2:32:01] christ
[2:32:06] they either stop at a sensation or
[2:32:08] something like that instead
[2:32:10] of being pointed to christ
[2:32:13] the word christ
[2:32:17] their word paul said in hebrew
[2:32:21] one god in sundra times
[2:32:25] spoke to us through the prophet but in
[2:32:27] these last days
[2:32:30] he has come to us through his word amen
[2:32:35] praise the lord that's the reason why
[2:32:38] when paul had an experience
[2:32:40] on the road of damascus
[2:32:43] when he said lord who i down
[2:32:47] referring to the old testament jehovah
[2:32:54] that experience have to point him back
[2:32:57] to the bible
[2:32:59] i'm jesus because the old testament
[2:33:02] jehovah was jesus of the new
[2:33:08] and that's what i think they are resting
[2:33:11] their internal
[2:33:12] destination upon some dark matter or
[2:33:14] some sensation
[2:33:17] like some says i dance in the spirit i
[2:33:19] speak with tongues
[2:33:20] fire fell run over
[2:33:24] and do and do you know all these things
[2:33:28] can be
[2:33:28] impersonated by devils
[2:33:32] there is just one thing that he cannot
[2:33:34] impersonate
[2:33:36] that's the word that's right amen
[2:33:41] in a debate between he and jesus each
[2:33:43] time jesus defeated him
[2:33:45] it is written the word and i believe
[2:33:48] today
[2:33:48] that's the reason that people are not
[2:33:51] coming to christ
[2:33:55] is because they appointed many of them
[2:33:58] to a denomination
[2:34:02] you come join our church
[2:34:05] praise the lord and i'll tell you today
[2:34:07] you can never fit in this church until
[2:34:09] you are born again
[2:34:12] i don't care how you tr how much you try
[2:34:14] to be regular
[2:34:17] praise the lord how much you try to
[2:34:20] spread your influence and make everybody
[2:34:23] to recognize you the church of jesus
[2:34:24] christ
[2:34:25] you can never fit in amen until
[2:34:28] you are born again that's right it must
[2:34:31] come by at birth
[2:34:33] amen that comes from the word the sea
[2:34:36] incorruptible
[2:34:42] hallelujah
[2:34:44] they have pointer to our denomination
[2:34:45] you come join our church oh
[2:34:47] you read the catechism and believe our
[2:34:49] doctrine or some system

[2:34:58] to trust the lord and you're just
[2:35:00] praying
[2:35:01] and you are there you know you you you
[2:35:03] you sit around
[2:35:04] you know the people you know that uh
[2:35:06] that you preach toward and all of that
[2:35:08] and yet you find people wonderful people
[2:35:12] they just they just they just they just
[2:35:14] enjoy
[2:35:15] hanging around
[2:35:19] praise the lord i mean they fight so
[2:35:22] hard to come to a birth
[2:35:26] they don't want to lose their
[2:35:28] personality
[2:35:29] you know they fight so hard you see them
[2:35:32] fighting
[2:35:36] and jacob thought one time he could
[2:35:38] fight

[2:35:42] lifting but you
[2:35:44] you are not you don't neighbor this word

[2:36:04] and sometimes it breaks your heart but
[2:36:05] you just have to be there you just pray
[2:36:07] say oh god
[2:36:08] help this brother help this sister lord
[2:36:10] bring them to a life of surrounding
[2:36:13] he said god get ahold of them send the
[2:36:15] holy ghost and let it arrest him when
[2:36:22] you ever get to that place
[2:36:23] you will never play church in your life
[2:36:26] because you will realize
[2:36:28] that this word is the breath that you
[2:36:31] breathe amen
[2:36:47] yeah are you a pointer to a denomination
[2:36:49] come and join the church and read
[2:36:50] catechism believe a doctrine
[2:36:52] or some system or something they are
[2:36:54] pointed in the wrong way
[2:36:57] and the action and life that they live
[2:37:01] without christ proof that they have not
[2:37:05] met christ
[2:37:07] no longer what what they claim
[2:37:10] the action you have to know that god is
[2:37:13] the one that says the rings
[2:37:15] and the heart you cannot impress him
[2:37:18] you cannot deceive him amen
[2:37:23] he knows your heart
[2:37:27] no matter how much you think you are
[2:37:29] sincere it's going to have the skill
[2:37:32] he weighs sincerity amen
[2:37:37] because every man is right in his own
[2:37:39] eyes
[2:37:40] but it's god that weighs the spirit amen
[2:37:44] and know how much sincerity is
[2:37:50] are we together amen
[2:37:53] the life the life the things they get
[2:37:56] themselves into
[2:37:58] just on a covering of a system or the
[2:38:01] church
[2:38:03] and i mean they can fight for their
[2:38:04] religion they can argue
[2:38:07] and all of that
[2:38:11] they are pointed in the wrong way in the
[2:38:14] action and the life that they live
[2:38:16] without christ
[2:38:18] proof in their own life is vindicated
[2:38:22] by the very thing for instance he says
[2:38:25] i don't want to hurt anybody but i've
[2:38:27] gone back and forth across this country
[2:38:30] condemning women for cutting their hairs
[2:38:32] and the way that they dress
[2:38:33] wearing shots and all of that praise the
[2:38:36] lord
[2:38:38] amen and people
[2:38:42] were crying and streaming how much to
[2:38:45] love god
[2:38:47] but it can never come in suggestion
[2:38:51] to the word of god
[2:38:55] he says that just a clear sign that
[2:38:56] people have been pointed away
[2:38:59] from god
[2:39:03] praise the lord
[2:39:08] in the message the holy ghost i've
[2:39:10] always loved this
[2:39:12] because they have it kind of taught me
[2:39:14] something
[2:39:16] he says i believe that we are so close
[2:39:20] to the coming of the lord jesus
[2:39:22] and it behold us to do all
[2:39:26] that we possibly can to bring
[2:39:30] every soul to the kingdom yes sir
[2:39:34] and to bring the kingdom
[2:39:37] to the people praise the lord
[2:39:46] you can bring souls to the kingdom
[2:39:49] and they can enter in and you don't
[2:39:51] enter
[2:39:57] but bring in the kingdom you have to
[2:39:59] carry
[2:40:00] yes sir i said oh god help me to bring
[2:40:03] the kingdom
[2:40:06] oh you can bring people to my house and
[2:40:08] they can go in and say harris's house

[2:40:12] message you can print people to the
[2:40:14] kingdom
[2:40:14] they can enter and you can enter
[2:40:18] but it's a different thing when you
[2:40:20] bring the kingdom
[2:40:23] amen when you bring the kingdom it's a
[2:40:25] complete different thing
[2:40:31] praise the lord amen

[2:40:45] amen
[2:40:46] don't worry let's go and see luke
[2:40:47] chapter four we want to look at isaiah
[2:40:50] prophecy yeah i was so close up here
[2:40:52] when we talk about the opening of the
[2:40:55] book and the losing of the seals
[2:40:57] we read from revelation chapter five
[2:40:59] that no man was wanted to open the book
[2:41:02] and to lose the seals amen
[2:41:06] no man was all walking to open the boat
[2:41:10] and to lose the seals
[2:41:11] that was what we were talking about last
[2:41:14] week
[2:41:16] amen all praise the lord
[2:41:19] you love the lord jesus he's so precious
[2:41:22] to us
[2:41:26] you coming in in very in luke chapter 4
[2:41:30] and we all know from the message this
[2:41:33] day this scripture
[2:41:34] is fulfilled what historically happened
[2:41:39] you know when when brother branham was
[2:41:41] reading from this book
[2:41:42] but i want to bring your attention to
[2:41:44] something here
[2:41:45] amen and and and this will help
[2:41:49] us to get a glance of what john was
[2:41:51] looking at in revelation chapter 5.
[2:41:55] revelation chapter 4 let's read from
[2:41:58] verse
[2:41:59] 16.
[2:42:03] and he came to nazareth where he had
[2:42:06] been brought
[2:42:07] up and as his custom was
[2:42:12] amen as he was accustomed to
[2:42:18] praise the lord just like our brother
[2:42:20] said
[2:42:21] jesus was accustomed to this whenever he
[2:42:24] goes to a city
[2:42:26] he makes sure he goes to church
[2:42:31] what his custom is not a tradition is
[2:42:34] something that he was
[2:42:35] accustomed to yeah right i tried amen
[2:42:44] and as his custom was he went into the
[2:42:46] synagogues
[2:42:48] on the sabbath day
[2:42:52] and stood up for to read
[2:42:56] praise the lord amen
[2:43:02] and we were told in the jewish
[2:43:04] synagogues
[2:43:07] right beside the high priest they always
[2:43:10] have
[2:43:10] an empty seat believing that
[2:43:14] that would be the seat of the messiah
[2:43:18] when he comes he will come straight to
[2:43:20] the synagogues and sit in that seat
[2:43:23] but this setting there jesus came to the
[2:43:25] synagogues
[2:43:27] he went right to the platform
[2:43:30] the high priest was sitting down and all
[2:43:32] the guys and then all the
[2:43:34] you know the priests and all the men in
[2:43:36] the synagogue everybody went to their
[2:43:38] place
[2:43:38] and jesus went straight
[2:43:42] there on the sabbath day
[2:43:45] he stood up and he read
[2:43:51] from the book of isaiah
[2:43:55] where it is written verse 17 and there
[2:43:58] he and there was deliver
[2:44:02] unto him the book of
[2:44:06] azai and then he flipped the page
[2:44:12] and when he had opened
[2:44:16] praise the lord so watch here now
[2:44:20] he comes in the cinegas he comes
[2:44:21] straight behind
[2:44:23] the high priest pulpit
[2:44:26] and he hand him a book and if they have
[2:44:29] hanging above for him to open it it has
[2:44:30] to be a closed book
[2:44:34] so he closed the book think about
[2:44:38] revelation chapter 5 now
[2:44:41] they had in the book and the bible said
[2:44:44] he
[2:44:44] opened the book
[2:44:48] praise the lord amen he opened the book
[2:44:51] and
[2:44:51] found where it is written
[2:44:55] he flipped the pages of the book
[2:44:59] oh thank you jesus
[2:45:04] and find a place where it is written the
[2:45:06] spirit of the lord god is upon me
[2:45:09] because he have anointed me to preach
[2:45:12] the gospel
[2:45:14] to the paul to send and he has sent me
[2:45:16] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[2:45:18] deliverance to the captive
[2:45:20] the uncovering of sight to the blind
[2:45:25] to set a liberty them that i bros to
[2:45:28] preach
[2:45:30] the acceptable year of the lord
[2:45:33] praise the lord and what he did
[2:45:38] he closed the book and then he gave it
[2:45:41] back to the minister
[2:45:44] and the scriptures say he sat
[2:45:47] down he went right in that seat
[2:45:52] that was kept for the messiah
[2:45:54] [Music]
[2:45:55] and he sat down
[2:46:00] and the bible said oh ice
[2:46:22] oh
[2:46:24] he sat there in the eyes of all them
[2:46:26] that were in the synagogues
[2:46:28] were fasting on him
[2:46:34] now remember now he have opened the book
[2:46:40] and he read from the book
[2:46:43] and what was he doing he was identified
[2:46:50] he was identified
[2:46:53] his ministry
[2:46:57] so what was he doing he was losing a
[2:47:00] seal
[2:47:02] because what isaiah said he prophesy but
[2:47:05] it was filled
[2:47:12] and jesus opened the book
[2:47:15] revelation chapter 5 and loose
[2:47:20] the seal that's right losing the seal
[2:47:24] is identifying his ministry
[2:47:28] with what is written in the book
[2:47:35] our eyes were fasting on him
[2:47:38] and he sat down and he looked at those
[2:47:41] very eyes that was looking at him
[2:47:45] and he said this day
[2:47:48] this scripture is fulfilled
[2:47:52] amen
[2:47:56] praise the lord amen
[2:47:59] he said this day this scripture
[2:48:06] is fulfilled and that's what i was
[2:48:09] talking about last week
[2:48:14] the bible says that the book was sealed
[2:48:16] with seven seals
[2:48:19] and no man was wanted to open the book
[2:48:21] or to lose the seals
[2:48:23] so you think about it the losing of the
[2:48:25] seals
[2:48:26] supposed to come before the opening of
[2:48:29] the book
[2:48:30] amen
[2:48:34] if the book is sealed you have to break
[2:48:36] the seal
[2:48:37] before you open the book but when the
[2:48:39] holy spirit wrote it the bible says
[2:48:42] no man was able to open the book and no
[2:48:45] man was able to lose the seals
[2:48:49] just like how david comes before abraham
[2:48:53] a lost line is out of place the seal is
[2:48:56] supposed to be broken
[2:48:57] before the book is open amen it does not
[2:49:01] work that way with god
[2:49:03] the book is first opened before
[2:49:06] the book is open and ministry is
[2:49:09] identified
[2:49:11] and then it's released to the people
[2:49:15] the releasing of the ministry of jesus
[2:49:18] christ
[2:49:19] in every age is the losing of the seal
[2:49:24] amen
[2:49:31] praise the lord the bible says
[2:49:35] and he closed the book
[2:49:38] after he have identified his ministry
[2:49:42] he closed the book and handed it down to
[2:49:46] them there is no way they could have
[2:49:47] seen him
[2:49:49] because he gave them a close book until
[2:49:52] god
[2:49:52] opened this book to you you can go to
[2:49:54] every school go to every church you want
[2:49:57] talk
[2:49:57] this book will never be opening to your
[2:49:59] understanding
[2:50:00] [Music]
[2:50:00] [Applause]
[2:50:02] that's right praise the lord
[2:50:05] oh that's the reason why too many this
[2:50:07] might sound funny but we're reading from
[2:50:09] an open book
[2:50:11] we're reading from an open book because
[2:50:14] a ministry has been
[2:50:15] identified and that ministry was
[2:50:18] released to the people of god
[2:50:20] bride today a rapture
[2:50:22] [Applause]
[2:50:24] this is not a message of do's and don'ts
[2:50:28] praise the lord if you've been whipped
[2:50:30] during the years with legalistic
[2:50:32] preaching
[2:50:32] you have not entered yet
[2:50:37] this is not a message of do's and don'ts
[2:50:41] this is a message where christ is
[2:50:43] released from an open book
[2:50:48] he want to be part of your life he want
[2:50:51] to go to school with you
[2:50:53] praise the lord he want to be on your
[2:50:55] phone with you
[2:50:59] he want to be on your cell phone with
[2:51:01] you
[2:51:03] praise the lord glory be to god
[2:51:11] no way they could have seen him
[2:51:14] no matter how he identified his ministry
[2:51:17] and said
[2:51:18] this day this scripture
[2:51:22] is fulfilled the state couldn't see it
[2:51:24] why
[2:51:25] because he gave them a close book
[2:51:32] praise the lord at the end of the book
[2:51:35] of luke after the resurrection of jesus
[2:51:37] christ
[2:51:38] the bible says when he appeared to those
[2:51:41] disciples on the road
[2:51:46] it was close to them he said what are
[2:51:50] you guys talking about
[2:51:51] [Laughter]
[2:51:52] [Music]
[2:51:54] he said they say are you a stranger
[2:51:58] are you a stranger don't you know what
[2:52:01] has happened
[2:52:04] and this man jesus and he went on
[2:52:07] talking and he went on talking
[2:52:13] that was supposed to be the messiah and
[2:52:15] the bible says from the prophets
[2:52:18] to the psalm when he started to talk he
[2:52:21] says
[2:52:21] this is what he says in the book of
[2:52:24] genesis chapter 3
[2:52:26] he was supposed to be
[2:52:30] the seed of the woman the bible says
[2:52:33] through the scripture he
[2:52:34] identified christ
[2:52:37] from the prophets to the sun
[2:52:43] and they were just enjoying it they were
[2:52:46] enjoying it but yet it was not open to
[2:52:49] them
[2:52:50] that's why many people sit there and
[2:52:52] enjoy the word but it's not open
[2:52:57] enjoying the world and say oh that was a
[2:52:59] great preaching i love it
[2:53:00] it still does not mean that it's open to
[2:53:02] you
[2:53:05] they enjoyed oh my goodness when he goes
[2:53:08] to simon says when david said my god
[2:53:10] my god he was speaking about him he said
[2:53:12] wow oh my god wow
[2:53:14] oh my wow
[2:53:17] that's why people do wow preaching wow
[2:53:19] preaching
[2:53:23] you are just admiring the word
[2:53:26] it just sounds good in your ears
[2:53:30] but when this book is open
[2:53:33] it changes life
[2:53:36] it changes lives
[2:53:40] it changes your habits it changes your
[2:53:43] desire
[2:53:46] it affects your ambitions it brings them
[2:53:49] under control
[2:53:50] when this book is open because it's a
[2:53:53] person
[2:53:59] and while the evening shadows were
[2:54:00] falling
[2:54:03] they said coming god come in
[2:54:06] about with us we enjoy you man this guy
[2:54:08] talking about the prophets and the time
[2:54:10] you know just
[2:54:11] identifying christ and all of this till
[2:54:13] then their eyes were still closed
[2:54:21] finally a supper time
[2:54:26] the scripture said he took the bread
[2:54:31] just before his crucification the same
[2:54:34] thing he did that night
[2:54:37] at suppertime he lift the bread up and
[2:54:41] bless it
[2:54:42] and then he broke the bread
[2:54:46] another type of the opening of the word
[2:54:49] he broke the bread the word is open
[2:54:53] and then he release it to them
[2:54:56] so the opening of the word comes
[2:55:00] before the losing of the seal
[2:55:03] the world has to be open to you for you
[2:55:06] to be free from
[2:55:07] guilt because when it's open to you
[2:55:11] it looses you revelation chapter one
[2:55:16] he have lose us with his own blood
[2:55:19] amen amen amen
[2:55:24] the opening of the word is christ
[2:55:27] being personal to you you don't tie him
[2:55:30] to a church
[2:55:33] you don't tie him to a preacher
[2:55:38] his person amen
[2:55:42] praise the lord
[2:55:45] oh that's the reason why you can read
[2:55:47] some things in the world you just get
[2:55:48] excited about it
[2:55:50] amen but that thing needs to be open
[2:55:55] it needs to affect you because the word
[2:55:58] is not for your intelligence
[2:56:00] the word is for your soul and when the
[2:56:03] word comes in your soul there it becomes
[2:56:05] your intelligence
[2:56:09] oh praise the lord my goodness

[2:56:37] complain about we wasting time
[2:56:39] we are giving tithe to the lord take the

[2:56:59] oh just forgive me i'm not going to give
[2:57:01] you a one-hour service
[2:57:04] i tried to stretch it out to three hours
[2:57:08] because i want you to be blessed

[2:57:37] hours of your time to god

[2:57:45] it's intent of tithing amen
[2:57:49] steady your message on nintendo tidy
[2:57:52] it's internal
[2:57:53] tiding yeah when you are able to set up
[2:57:57] time in your life

[2:58:14] give the rest
[2:58:16] antenna tiding is more than your money
[2:58:20] [Music]
[2:58:22] that's why people gave tithe and they
[2:58:24] get so crushed about it
[2:58:27] all the just singers hey the pastor
[2:58:28] eating our money it's not a revelation
[2:58:30] to you
[2:58:35] because god wants something more than
[2:58:37] your money
[2:58:38] amen if your heart is on the altar
[2:58:42] no matter how much you give to god
[2:58:52] when you leave for me why are you going
[2:58:53] to do
[2:58:55] praise the lord you tell me there's a

[2:59:26] it's a reality glory be to god
[2:59:32] i've not got one report of the deacon
[2:59:33] stopping anybody to leave
[2:59:38] amen amen praise the lord
[2:59:42] after we opened up for service memorial
[2:59:45] service we were going to have and
[2:59:47] and uh we we we have a farmer preaching
[2:59:50] for us that we can
[2:59:51] and we said when we come back to the
[2:59:52] building you know we i mean everybody
[2:59:55] should wear max
[2:59:56] you know because we we just want to keep
[2:59:58] this place safe
[2:59:59] we have such a small space amen i'm
[3:00:02] afraid i want one of these
[3:00:03] this building will just break down and
[3:00:05] then we'll just have service in the open
[3:00:07] air
[3:00:08] because sometimes the anointing is so
[3:00:09] strong in this place
[3:00:11] it looks like it's going to explode
[3:00:15] and i was sitting out there we had a
[3:00:17] tent we put the tent up and
[3:00:18] we say if you don't want to wear max you
[3:00:20] just go under the tent we have
[3:00:22] we we were streaming the service from
[3:00:24] there and all of that
[3:00:26] and then the dear brother came to church
[3:00:28] at girlfriend
[3:00:29] and then uh he was just all wrapped up
[3:00:32] in this thing can
[3:00:33] you know max and all of that and and and
[3:00:35] that and he just got so
[3:00:37] he he just got so cross he got so angry
[3:00:40] and they feel like well how can we wear
[3:00:42] max in the house of god
[3:00:44] and he walked out you know what uh just
[3:00:46] throwing that match down and i saw him
[3:00:48] going i could see on the
[3:00:50] on the string him walking out of the
[3:00:51] service i just prayed and just committed
[3:00:53] him in the hands of the lord
[3:00:56] but you see when a person has that kind
[3:00:58] of
[3:00:59] arrogant spirit in the house of the lord
[3:01:02] praise the lord amen if you think about
[3:01:06] having your wife and your little
[3:01:08] children
[3:01:09] in this building in a time where we
[3:01:12] where where they have not even found a
[3:01:14] vastness for this
[3:01:15] coronavirus and we don't even know where
[3:01:17] it's going and where it's going to end
[3:01:19] and we still want to gather together
[3:01:22] and think that this is a safe way
[3:01:25] and you think that your revelation is
[3:01:28] superior to anybody
[3:01:31] praise the lord
[3:01:44] glory be to god
[3:01:59] i mean there are people i drive on lake
[3:02:02] street every day
[3:02:04] every morning i see prostitutes on the
[3:02:08] street
[3:02:09] i see people all toast up in drugs
[3:02:12] there's a guy there he just
[3:02:13] so drunk up he comes cleaning people
[3:02:16] window water you want your windshield
[3:02:17] weap on that he counts out of that
[3:02:20] you know and just to get a dollar
[3:02:22] assault and sometimes i would just
[3:02:23] i would just give him a dollar but i put
[3:02:26] a prayer behind that dollar and said
[3:02:27] lord you have that man
[3:02:29] praise the lord amen
[3:02:32] because i know i mean until god help him
[3:02:35] he might take that dollar to go and buy
[3:02:36] another drugs
[3:02:38] also but i put a prayer behind and i'm
[3:02:40] not just doing it because i feel sorry
[3:02:42] for him
[3:02:42] i'm doing it because i'm making contact
[3:02:45] and so and and all of that i'd rather go
[3:02:49] on
[3:02:50] on the street and look for somebody that
[3:02:52] is so fed up with drugs
[3:02:54] that nothing will make sense to him than
[3:02:56] to deal with a person
[3:02:58] that has a religious spirit
[3:03:02] yes sir i'd rather go talk to somebody
[3:03:05] that is so drugged up
[3:03:08] and they can argue to me about jesus if
[3:03:10] there is a jesus let him change me
[3:03:12] i will rather deal with that person than
[3:03:15] a person that will come and sit down
[3:03:16] here with a religious spirit
[3:03:22] praise the lord
[3:03:26] we have one box that we are
[3:03:30] submitting and that's the holy spirit
[3:03:33] amen you might have your own ideas and
[3:03:36] what you think is best for you
[3:03:41] and you want to make suggestions you
[3:03:42] want to do what whatever you want
[3:03:44] let me get back to my message i don't
[3:03:46] know who put him into all of these
[3:03:47] things
[3:03:48] let me find a place to close up here
[3:03:53] praise the lord on on uh
[3:03:57] uh the on uh
[3:04:01] last sunday we uh
[3:04:04] we we read a quote from statue of
[3:04:06] epiphan let me read that and then i'll
[3:04:08] find a place to close here
[3:04:09] now these people peter is saying
[3:04:13] listen to this closely now it's reading
[3:04:15] from the book of peter about the statute
[3:04:17] of the peppermint out to your faith
[3:04:19] attitude
[3:04:19] and and knowledge and and temperance and
[3:04:22] godliness and all of that
[3:04:25] peter is saying yeah how that we must be
[3:04:28] partakers of his divine nature
[3:04:34] now each one of us are trying to grow
[3:04:38] into the stature of god
[3:04:42] the scripture says being partaker
[3:04:47] of his divine nature
[3:04:52] that's the purpose of the word of god is
[3:04:55] to change
[3:04:56] our nature
[3:04:59] that's where you should look for the
[3:05:01] evidence of the holy ghost
[3:05:03] is the change of your nature
[3:05:07] amen
[3:05:11] the evidence of the holy ghost has
[3:05:12] nothing to do with the changing of your
[3:05:14] closet
[3:05:16] all the changing of your hair style
[3:05:19] [Music]
[3:05:21] is the changing of your nature
[3:05:32] being partakers of his divine nature
[3:05:36] now each one of us are trying to grow in
[3:05:38] the statue now
[3:05:40] after we get through with the seven
[3:05:43] seals
[3:05:45] then at that time of the
[3:05:48] sounding of the seven seals the losing
[3:05:53] listing now i read this last week we
[3:05:55] know
[3:05:56] what a seal is is
[3:06:00] to lose the ministry
[3:06:04] praise the lord what isaiah prophesy
[3:06:08] was sealed when
[3:06:11] jesus came he was loosening that seal
[3:06:18] by identifying
[3:06:21] that scripture
[3:06:26] and seeing this day what isaiah said
[3:06:30] 700 years ago is fulfilled
[3:06:37] praise the lord think about this
[3:06:40] jesus has just come down from the
[3:06:42] mountain
[3:06:44] being tempted by the devil even before
[3:06:47] he went into his ministry
[3:06:51] so he came before the religious people
[3:06:54] of that day
[3:06:59] look that could have break the millennia
[3:07:01] on earth
[3:07:03] but orlando if those people could have
[3:07:06] identified
[3:07:08] that that was their messiah
[3:07:12] he could have just started the kingdom
[3:07:14] of devi
[3:07:20] before he went into his ministry right
[3:07:23] from the mountain of temptation straight
[3:07:24] to the synagogues
[3:07:26] and he's identifying his ministry
[3:07:31] praise the lord amen
[3:07:36] you know that's why paul says every man
[3:07:38] wait on your ministry
[3:07:41] amen you have to wait you have to
[3:07:44] identify what god called you to do
[3:07:46] amen glory be to god
[3:07:50] praise the lord we are a bunch of
[3:07:52] preachers that don't even know where
[3:07:54] they are calling us
[3:07:55] they are just preachers well let me let
[3:07:58] me leave that let me stay
[3:07:59] right here amen i'm safe when i stay
[3:08:03] right here
[3:08:04] glory be to god so we see here
[3:08:08] he was identifying his ministry
[3:08:15] to proclaim liberty
[3:08:19] which was the jubilee to set the captain
[3:08:22] free
[3:08:23] but you see there was another part of
[3:08:25] the prophecy the day of virgins
[3:08:28] that he did not read
[3:08:33] when he talks about the acceptable year
[3:08:36] he just closed the book
[3:08:37] so jesus himself was identifying that
[3:08:41] this prophecy has twofold
[3:08:43] it has a second part i'm now identifying
[3:08:47] the first part
[3:08:49] [Music]
[3:08:51] i'm identifying to you this part
[3:08:54] the acceptable year of the lord
[3:08:58] today is the day of your visitation when
[3:09:01] he knocked
[3:09:02] at your heart don't hide in your heart
[3:09:06] amen praise the lord
[3:09:11] do you think that those pharisees and
[3:09:14] sahindrans
[3:09:15] allow a man to have not come in their
[3:09:18] system
[3:09:19] to move there and sit in that royal seat
[3:09:22] that they kept for the messiah
[3:09:26] but you see god was in control
[3:09:31] god was in control that nothing they
[3:09:33] could have done
[3:09:35] because it was a day for god's word to
[3:09:37] be fulfilled
[3:09:40] and that's the scene where god was in
[3:09:42] control when brother brown was preaching
[3:09:44] birth pains god was in control that he
[3:09:47] could not find
[3:09:49] his scripture from a new bible
[3:09:52] god was in control when a catholic
[3:09:55] priest
[3:09:55] handed him his bible and said my son
[3:09:58] be steady god is about to move god was
[3:10:01] in control
[3:10:03] [Applause]
[3:10:04] oh praise the lord
[3:10:08] praise the lord brother branham you me a
[3:10:12] catholic priest
[3:10:13] i was just listening to a broken system
[3:10:16] because broken system was the message
[3:10:18] that he preached before he preached
[3:10:20] birth pains
[3:10:20] and verbal was talking about how that
[3:10:22] catalytic predicate of the priest was
[3:10:24] sitting right there
[3:10:25] he says the man came to me and he says
[3:10:28] our dear brother stanley he came to me
[3:10:30] he says he said he said he said brother
[3:10:33] branham
[3:10:34] you mean that this businessman can i see
[3:10:36] what you're talking about
[3:10:38] he said i see it.
[3:10:41] he said you mean a catholic priest
[3:10:43] identifying
[3:10:45] that that's there that should be
[3:10:46] administered among the people
[3:10:50] and this businessman couldn't see it
[3:10:57] oh my goodness but god was in control
[3:11:01] amen god arrested the situation
[3:11:06] yeah because one
[3:11:09] his seven was talking about birth pains
[3:11:12] which of course birth pains
[3:11:14] what is birth pains birth pains
[3:11:17] is a time for a baby
[3:11:20] to be released
[3:11:26] when a mother goes through birth pains
[3:11:29] amen a seal
[3:11:32] is about to be broken and a life
[3:11:36] is about to be released
[3:11:38] [Laughter]
[3:11:41] oh my goodness oh my goodness
[3:11:47] and that's why he was talking about how
[3:11:50] the ages have gone through birth pains
[3:11:54] and every time there was a birth pain
[3:11:56] god
[3:11:57] released a ministry to the people amen
[3:12:02] the ministry of jesus christ a life of
[3:12:04] christ
[3:12:05] is released to the people yes sir
[3:12:14] oh my goodness praise the lord
[3:12:17] are we together let's just read this let
[3:12:21] me close here
[3:12:22] amen
[3:12:26] we know that what a seal is
[3:12:30] is to lose a ministry
[3:12:33] to lose seven seals and we
[3:12:36] will see that right in the chat
[3:12:40] is losing a message
[3:12:43] something that's seal up
[3:12:47] something that was sealed throughout the
[3:12:49] ages
[3:12:50] is about to be released to the people
[3:12:54] god has to release something to change
[3:12:58] our body for a rapture
[3:13:01] creeds and darkness will not do it
[3:13:03] that's right
[3:13:04] amen all it would do is just adjust
[3:13:07] break start another church
[3:13:08] and go back to the same failure break
[3:13:10] start another church and go back to the
[3:13:12] same failure
[3:13:15] praise the lord amen amen
[3:13:22] glory be to god and i don't know i don't
[3:13:26] care what you think about it
[3:13:28] but god has always had
[3:13:32] his men in his hands talking to a dear
[3:13:35] friend of mine
[3:13:36] in a week here good friend of mine best
[3:13:39] friend of mine we were just talking
[3:13:41] and then he asked me this is he says
[3:13:43] brother i don't know what is happening
[3:13:46] you know he says you know how
[3:13:50] we africans get fanatic about things
[3:13:54] he said this press play is becoming
[3:13:56] fanatical
[3:13:58] that people are using that
[3:14:01] to continue in their way of life
[3:14:05] because they don't want to submit to a
[3:14:07] ministry
[3:14:08] they don't want to submit they don't
[3:14:11] want no order they don't want anybody to
[3:14:13] tell them anything
[3:14:14] so they think they can press play to go
[3:14:17] in the rapture
[3:14:20] he said it's just getting crazy and most
[3:14:23] of the people that are feeling into that
[3:14:27] are backsliders people who will drink
[3:14:30] their alcohol and still press
[3:14:31] play that's right
[3:14:37] because they don't want to submit to a
[3:14:38] ministry
[3:14:47] may god help us
[3:14:52] he says last saturday night i preached
[3:14:54] on the key this was the key to the door
[3:14:57] he says the key is faith
[3:15:01] the faith holds the key and the key is
[3:15:04] the scripture christ is the dawn
[3:15:08] see so fit takes the little hinge
[3:15:11] of the scripture and unlock the glory
[3:15:17] and the goodness that's that's that is
[3:15:20] the releasing of christ
[3:15:23] is to bring his glory upon the people
[3:15:26] praise the lord because what the isaiah
[3:15:30] said
[3:15:30] was going to happen in the second part
[3:15:33] of that prophecy
[3:15:34] he want to change your your your your
[3:15:37] your access to beauty
[3:15:39] yeah he want to give you a garment of
[3:15:42] praise
[3:15:43] now no matter what you are going through
[3:15:46] no matter how the devil blasts your mind
[3:15:48] you know christ is seal in your heart
[3:15:51] you can still live for your hands and
[3:15:52] praise the lord
[3:15:54] [Music]
[3:15:56] and this church will be the beauty of
[3:15:59] the lord
[3:16:00] the planting of the lord that he might
[3:16:03] be glorified
[3:16:04] oh i just believe that god want to put
[3:16:07] the glory on his people
[3:16:09] amen we just get sometimes so stuck in
[3:16:12] our personalities
[3:16:14] and we have our own ideas and we have
[3:16:16] our own revelation and
[3:16:18] i mean we're just so still but the fact
[3:16:20] about the matter that is that all of
[3:16:21] those things are just up here
[3:16:26] but the way that god deal with us is
[3:16:28] down here
[3:16:33] he deeds with you from here outside
[3:16:38] he start changing you from the inside
[3:16:40] and it's reflected on the outside
[3:16:45] so he said faith it takes the hinges of
[3:16:48] the scripture and it unlocks
[3:16:50] the glory and the goodness of god
[3:16:54] out to his people it unlocks a release
[3:17:02] glory be to god you see that's the
[3:17:04] reason why
[3:17:05] god is releasing himself to his people
[3:17:08] because when this church come
[3:17:09] on a persecution he want to be with you
[3:17:13] praise the lord when we cannot gather
[3:17:16] back anymore
[3:17:17] he want to be with us in our different

[3:17:43] goodness of god out to his people
[3:17:45] see so his fit holds the keys that
[3:17:48] unlock
[3:17:49] christ told the people
[3:17:54] is the reason why a faith was promised
[3:17:56] to be restored in this day
[3:17:59] that's right and the reason why
[3:18:02] is to release christ to a people
[3:18:06] yes not to bring a people to a man but
[3:18:09] to release christ
[3:18:15] that's the reason why that prophet god
[3:18:16] said the gift is for the people

[3:18:25] god is not a hysterical god he comes out
[3:18:27] of the pages of this bible
