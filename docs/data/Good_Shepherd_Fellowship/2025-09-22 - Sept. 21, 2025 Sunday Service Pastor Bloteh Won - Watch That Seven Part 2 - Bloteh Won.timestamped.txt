[1:09:40] Let's take our Bibles. Matthew chapter
[1:09:42] 17.
[1:09:44] Matthew chapter 17.
[1:09:55] Matthew chapter 17.
[1:10:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:18] We started
[1:10:20] um another
[1:10:25] we started another uh I don't know if I
[1:10:29] would say the sequence because we uh we
[1:10:31] have a lot of them uh that we have not
[1:10:36] being able to get through. But uh uh
[1:10:39] Wednesday night we talked on wash day 7.
[1:10:42] I want to continue with that this
[1:10:44] morning. Watch that 7 and uh uh
[1:10:55] let's read uh Matthew chapter 17 reading
[1:10:58] from verse one. And after six days
[1:11:02] taking Peter, James, and John his
[1:11:05] brother, and bringing them up into a
[1:11:08] high mountain apart,
[1:11:11] and was transfigured
[1:11:13] before them. The seven is always a
[1:11:16] mystery.
[1:11:17] After sixth day, the seven he was
[1:11:20] transfigured before them. Praise the
[1:11:23] Lord. He was transfigured before them,
[1:11:25] and his face did shine as the sun, and
[1:11:29] his remnant was white as the light. And
[1:11:33] behold, there appear unto him Moses and
[1:11:37] Elias talking with him.
[1:11:40] Then answered Peter and said unto Jesus,
[1:11:44] Lord, it is good for us to be here. If
[1:11:47] thou wilt, let us make three tabernacle,
[1:11:52] one for they and one for Moses, and one
[1:11:56] for Elias. While he yet speak, behold, a
[1:12:00] bright cloud overshadowed them. And
[1:12:03] behold, a voice out of the cloud which
[1:12:06] said, "This is my beloved son, in whom I
[1:12:10] am well pleased, y him."
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 17.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 17.
[1:12:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:36] Re sorry Revelation chapter 10. N 17.
[1:12:41] Revelation chapter 10.
[1:12:45] Revelation chapter 10.
[1:12:51] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:12:54] from heaven, clothed in the cloud, and
[1:12:57] the rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:13:00] face as it were the sun and his feet as
[1:13:04] pillows of fire.
[1:13:08] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:13:13] open and he set his right foot upon the
[1:13:16] sea and his left foot upon the earth.
[1:13:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; What I want to grab your attention to as
[1:13:25] we read the scripture this morning,
[1:13:27] Revelation chapter 10 begins with a
[1:13:30] conjunction.
[1:13:32] Verse one is a conjunction and verse two
[1:13:35] is a conjunction and verse three is a
[1:13:38] conjunction and verse four. When you get
[1:13:41] to verse seven, which is the seventh
[1:13:44] conjunction,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; it changes. It's no long, but it's but.
[1:13:51] and uh uh and and uh uh uh
[1:13:57] the
[1:13:59] English speakers will tell you they are
[1:14:01] the uh the the conjunction
[1:14:05] but make an emphasis.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Why the conjunction and just connect
[1:14:13] this statement with that statement.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; It connects uh uh the nouns the cover
[1:14:20] the rest. But the the the conjunction,
[1:14:22] but
[1:14:24] it makes a contract or uh it makes u uh
[1:14:29] an exception.
[1:14:31] It's different in that way. Either it
[1:14:33] either brings a contract or an opposing
[1:14:37] statement or it makes an exception.
[1:14:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to bring your
[1:14:44] mind to because the seventh is always a
[1:14:48] mystery.
[1:14:50] Okay. So in the seventh verse something
[1:14:53] changes.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the
[1:14:59] seven angel when he shall begin to sign
[1:15:02] the mystery of God shall be finished.
[1:15:05] Let's bow our heads and pray together.
[1:15:07] Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord
[1:15:09] Jesus Christ, I pray and say, "Oh God,
[1:15:13] just uh come and help Lord uh your
[1:15:16] feeble servant this morning. I just ask
[1:15:19] that Lord God, you will come out of the
[1:15:21] pages of your word and come and speak to
[1:15:24] us. Lord, I give you the praise. I give
[1:15:27] you the glory and honor this morning.
[1:15:29] Just bless us in your presence now. In
[1:15:32] Jesus name we pray."
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. Also, uh
[1:15:37] talked to Sister Mary yesterday. She
[1:15:40] said she was not going to be in service
[1:15:43] uh because of uh uh different things
[1:15:46] happening around her. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:50] And she asked that we pray for her son
[1:15:54] Lord, the one who she stayed with.
[1:15:58] This morning I want to go back like I
[1:16:00] said uh uh Wednesday night uh after what
[1:16:04] we spoke about last week and uh talking
[1:16:08] about the turn the world upside down and
[1:16:11] we read uh Isaiah chapter uh five and in
[1:16:16] Isaiah chapter 5 we there with the with
[1:16:19] the six wars that Isaiah prophesied
[1:16:23] about you know uh addressing the nation
[1:16:28] Israel and also addressing the word
[1:16:30] because he's a prophet. Sometimes a
[1:16:33] prophet message is not just only to the
[1:16:36] people he's speaking to. Sometimes is to
[1:16:38] the word which of course we see that
[1:16:40] with Isaiah because he prophesied about
[1:16:43] the millennium. He prophesied about the
[1:16:45] rapture. He prophesied about the coming
[1:16:47] of the Messiah and all of that. So we
[1:16:50] see Isaiah was bringing this prophecy to
[1:16:53] the people. And then in chapter six uh
[1:16:57] uh the scripture will introduce us to
[1:17:00] Yuzier his his good friend and and and
[1:17:04] uh and and relative somehow passed away
[1:17:08] and Aziah went into the temple. So there
[1:17:11] we also see that in the temple when he
[1:17:14] went to pray the Bible said he said woe
[1:17:17] is me and and uh uh strange enough when
[1:17:22] I was reading the scripture it never it
[1:17:24] never uh uh dawn on me on uh uh last
[1:17:27] Sunday but when I were reading during
[1:17:29] the week and uh uh it just dawn on me
[1:17:32] that if you go back uh there's five wall
[1:17:35] and year is the seventh with Isaiah
[1:17:38] himself in the temple
[1:17:40] Praise the Lord. And this little
[1:17:42] statement uh uh brother Brandon made
[1:17:45] from souls in praising uh he's talking
[1:17:48] about the seals and the trumpets and all
[1:17:50] of that. And he and and he made this
[1:17:53] statement where he says the seven is
[1:17:55] always a mystery. Watch the seven.
[1:17:59] That's the finish.
[1:18:01] That was the coming of of the Lord.
[1:18:04] Heaven was quiet, silent. Nobody move.
[1:18:09] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:18:17] Okay.
[1:18:20] Nobody move.
[1:18:24] Hallelujah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:18:37] So uh uh so then I just I just started
[1:18:41] dwelling on that. Watch the seven and
[1:18:44] started going through different
[1:18:46] different seven you know Jesus talking
[1:18:48] to the woman at the word you know five
[1:18:50] husband the one you work with is now
[1:18:52] your husband. There was six and uh then
[1:18:55] where is the seven? He was the seven.
[1:18:58] Amen. He was the seven.
[1:19:01] There are six city of refuge when you go
[1:19:04] back and read in the old testament but
[1:19:06] Jesus became the seven when he said come
[1:19:08] unto me all you that labor and as heavy
[1:19:11] laden and I will give you rest.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:20] And uh uh
[1:19:23] uh
[1:19:26] I just I just pray that uh what we have
[1:19:28] to share with you this morning will be a
[1:19:30] blessing to you. uh u
[1:19:36] because there there are few things that
[1:19:37] I want to look at like I like I told you
[1:19:41] uh I spoke some things uh yet in the
[1:19:43] past and then uh uh while I was away I
[1:19:48] spoke on the same subject but in a very
[1:19:50] different way. So that I want to go into
[1:19:53] there this morning. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:59] Jesus took his disciples six days after
[1:20:01] sixth day.
[1:20:03] After six day, which was the seventh, he
[1:20:06] took them up on the mountain. Billy, how
[1:20:09] are you? God bless you. He came back
[1:20:12] with more beard than before. Oh, maybe
[1:20:15] just a few days. I didn't see you.
[1:20:18] And uh uh
[1:20:23] six day and the seven. And then here
[1:20:25] comes the the transfiguration.
[1:20:28] You know, brother Ben Brandon would call
[1:20:30] that uh his adoption. Here come his
[1:20:33] transfiguration. This is up on the
[1:20:35] mountain. This is up on the mountain. Uh
[1:20:39] uh and I'm I'm just really really
[1:20:41] praying that I won't do an ugly job here
[1:20:43] this morning. But this is here up on the
[1:20:46] mountain and he's transfigured before
[1:20:48] his disciple. The glory of the Lord has
[1:20:50] come. You know there's a cloud that is
[1:20:52] upon the mountain and uh and Peter
[1:20:55] looking at the cloud and says what is
[1:20:57] good for us to be here is very good for
[1:21:00] us to be here but then in the same reg
[1:21:03] you know he want to build three
[1:21:05] tabernacle and and God is saying no this
[1:21:09] is my beloved son
[1:21:11] amen
[1:21:14] so but what what I want us to look at
[1:21:16] this morning is that if you go back to
[1:21:20] Isaiah chapter 6. Like we said uh uh uh
[1:21:25] on Wednesday night uh the Bible says uh
[1:21:29] uh his train filled the temple.
[1:21:33] His train filled the temple
[1:21:37] and uh uh I read to you on Wednesday
[1:21:41] night if uh the our young people they
[1:21:44] won't share with us. Revelation chapter
[1:21:47] 43. Now listening, in the year that
[1:21:50] Uzziah, the king Uzziah died, I saw the
[1:21:54] Lord sitting upon his throne high and
[1:21:56] lifted up. His train filled the temple.
[1:21:59] Glory. What? His train. There it is.
[1:22:03] Angels,
[1:22:05] beans.
[1:22:07] His train that follow him. this the
[1:22:11] train what come behind his train filled
[1:22:14] the temple and above it stood the
[1:22:17] saraphins. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Now if you study Revelation series you
[1:22:22] will see where brother Brandham talks
[1:22:24] about this tree that filled the temple
[1:22:27] was the lion, the ox, the man and the
[1:22:30] eagle.
[1:22:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; And which of course he says is a
[1:22:36] charing. You remember when we did that
[1:22:39] drama year where we have four person and
[1:22:41] we lock our hands.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; And and and one go this way then one go
[1:22:47] that that way.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And uh if you don't remember we can do
[1:22:52] it again. I still have four guys here.
[1:22:55] We can we can play it out again. Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Do you want us to do it again?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:08] Ah man, you want us to play it again?
[1:23:11] Okay, we'll do that.
[1:23:14] I'd be glad to do that for you. Okay,
[1:23:17] let's uh uh the reason why I love that
[1:23:21] is because
[1:23:23] uh even even when I was away, I use it
[1:23:25] in most of my services I preach. I think
[1:23:27] one or two I didn't use it. But uh
[1:23:30] whenever you whenever that is done, it
[1:23:34] brings it brings a very different
[1:23:39] picture. It brings a clear picture.
[1:23:43] Let me show you why I say it brings a
[1:23:45] clear picture. Let's go to the book of
[1:23:47] Ezekiel.
[1:23:52] Let's go to the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel
[1:23:54] chapter 1.
[1:23:57] Ezekiel chapter one
[1:24:08] you know the Laudishia church age was
[1:24:10] the Pentecostal age
[1:24:12] so when the so when the when the
[1:24:14] messenger came he came to the
[1:24:16] Pentecostal people that's the reason why
[1:24:18] the Pentecostal people uh embraced the
[1:24:22] message because they were they were
[1:24:23] experiencing the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:26] and and and pretty soon the church was
[1:24:28] drifting from there into organization.
[1:24:31] So those that were still holding to the
[1:24:33] manifestation of the Holy Ghost, they
[1:24:36] admire brother Brandon gift. Even uh God
[1:24:39] in Peterson that was in this city,
[1:24:41] Minneapolis, they they admire brother
[1:24:44] Brandon gift. So they were always
[1:24:45] bringing brother Brandon to their
[1:24:47] meeting, you know. Uh uh but you see the
[1:24:50] message has come to take us from the
[1:24:53] Pentecostal age into the bride age.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] Are we together
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; into the bride age? So uh uh uh uh we
[1:25:07] have a lot of uh uh uh you know uh uh
[1:25:12] carryover. I heard a brother said and I
[1:25:14] really love that. I said I'm going to
[1:25:16] I'm going to stick that on the fifth
[1:25:18] rate. He said uh he said there are many.
[1:25:20] There's there's brother Alberta Green
[1:25:22] from Trinidad, an old man. He says, he
[1:25:25] says, "We have we have uh overcomers and
[1:25:29] we have people that come over."
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; I said, "That's a good one because the
[1:25:36] reason why I say that is because uh
[1:25:38] there were a lot of carryovers.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; There were a lot of carryovers. People
[1:25:43] try to carry holiness over to the
[1:25:45] message. They try to carry the uh uh uh
[1:25:49] you know, things from the Pentecost age.
[1:25:51] you know the way they prayed and all
[1:25:53] that prayer meeting and just there were
[1:25:55] just a lot of carryover. But as you get
[1:25:58] into the opening of the word and you
[1:26:01] really start to understand what this
[1:26:03] message is about, you realize that most
[1:26:06] of the carryover starts to fall out.
[1:26:08] Amen. Because a lot of the carryover
[1:26:11] they are just men own impression.
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; I can impress you. You can try to if you
[1:26:19] if you can impress me, but we can't
[1:26:21] impress God.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; He knows our end from the beginning. He
[1:26:26] knows the the the length of our
[1:26:29] strength.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 1. Ezekiel chapter 1. Is
[1:26:36] that what I said?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter one.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; So Ezekiel chapter one, let's read verse
[1:26:42] six. Now, Ezek Ezekiel chapter one talks
[1:26:46] about
[1:26:49] he talks about the cherubim. Verse four,
[1:26:53] let's read from verse four. And I look
[1:26:55] and behold, a whalewind came out of the
[1:26:57] north. A great cloud and the fire
[1:27:00] unfolding itself is brightness was about
[1:27:04] it. And out of the mist thereof was uh a
[1:27:08] color of amber. Out of the midst of the
[1:27:11] fire also out of the midst thereof came
[1:27:14] a likeness
[1:27:16] of four living creatures.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; In Revelation is called four beasts but
[1:27:22] it's the same here. A likeness a
[1:27:24] creature a likeness of four living
[1:27:27] creature
[1:27:28] and this was his appearance.
[1:27:32] They had the likeness of a man.
[1:27:37] And everyone have four faces
[1:27:42] and everyone have four wings.
[1:27:46] Now
[1:27:48] when you read this like this,
[1:27:52] when you read it like this, it's easy
[1:27:55] for you to understand that all the
[1:27:58] living creature individually have four
[1:28:01] faces.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Is that not the way you understand it?
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; That's the way you understand it.
[1:28:08] And that's the way every Bible reader
[1:28:09] will understand it
[1:28:15] because the man that spoke these things
[1:28:16] were not yet to really explain what the
[1:28:18] vision is. And that's the reason why God
[1:28:21] now will have to send a prophet, an
[1:28:23] interpreter of the word to be able to
[1:28:26] get right back there and explain it to
[1:28:28] us.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh uh Emmanuel, can
[1:28:34] you put my picture up? Not the cloud,
[1:28:38] the the the four faces. Okay.
[1:28:44] Now, so I didn't clean the picture very
[1:28:47] well.
[1:28:50] There's there's more work I need to do
[1:28:51] on it now. So, so if you if you see
[1:28:55] this,
[1:28:56] this is the man, the lion, the eagle,
[1:28:59] and the home back there is the ox.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; That would be the same thing if if I
[1:29:11] have four brothers here and we lock arms
[1:29:13] together.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; now? So uh uh
[1:29:24] now you see that is the reason why the
[1:29:26] drama come on my friend come and help me
[1:29:28] come
[1:29:31] you you
[1:29:32] [Music]
[1:29:36] come on come on belly
[1:29:41] let me use you for once before you go
[1:29:43] back
[1:29:47] so you stand right here Take your hand
[1:29:49] from your pocket, bro.
[1:29:52] You are angel. Angel don't have in
[1:29:53] pockets.
[1:29:56] So you stand on the side.
[1:29:59] No, look. Look that way. Yeah. Look that
[1:30:01] way. Okay. You come close and so you
[1:30:04] lock your hand with this guy and lock
[1:30:06] your hands there. Then I lock my ear.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; So you see that's that is the picture
[1:30:10] that we have right here.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:14] Ezekiel said each one of them have four
[1:30:18] faces.
[1:30:20] No, the four faces
[1:30:23] is identify with any of the beast
[1:30:27] because let me let me do it this way
[1:30:31] now. If uh uh if uh brother Peterson is
[1:30:35] the ox and you go when he go we all go.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see they are not going in
[1:30:44] separate ways.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; So because it is the ox anointing
[1:30:49] the f is joined with him.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; It's one anointing.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; It's one anointing. So that is the
[1:31:03] reason why the ox anointing can be seen.
[1:31:07] You can have the the the the the ox
[1:31:11] anointing in the age was the dark age,
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; You as an individual, you can be honor
[1:31:21] the ox anointing when you are going
[1:31:23] through trial.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; It's an it's an anointing of patience.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; You are under that anointing for that
[1:31:34] season. But what is happening here is
[1:31:36] that because God protects the church
[1:31:39] with the full anointing you that the the
[1:31:43] ox anointing is back with the rest of
[1:31:45] the other anointing.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; They don't leave him alone.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Right? Okay.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Now the reason why I'm saying that
[1:31:53] because I want to explain what the train
[1:31:55] is. The train is this all of this lock
[1:31:59] because they are like that. It's a
[1:32:01] train. The Bible say his train filled
[1:32:03] the temple
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; so the angels wings were locked and they
[1:32:09] were moving
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; in cycle. Are we together?
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Bless you brothers. Have your seat.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; I I love this demonstration. That's my
[1:32:22] specialty.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; That's my specialty. I'm telling you
[1:32:26] when I when I get in there I I I it
[1:32:29] looks like the full anointing just come
[1:32:30] on me right away and I mean I'm I feel
[1:32:33] so anointed. Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; That's my specialty. It it it it helped
[1:32:37] me to bring it out in a way that uh
[1:32:40] become so clear. Amen.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Now so it is not that they have
[1:32:45] individual four face or one having four
[1:32:48] faces. Lord
[1:32:50] at the time the on whatever anointing
[1:32:54] that they are the four powers the four
[1:32:58] strength is is is united in
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; now so so that's that is the train that
[1:33:09] fills the temple the train that fills
[1:33:11] the temple is how this angel lock their
[1:33:14] wings andh because
[1:33:18] man
[1:33:20] praise the Lord.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:24] I remember I this this will be review
[1:33:26] for for many of you that have heard over
[1:33:29] the pit here but uh uh you know uh
[1:33:33] brother Brandon will say right from from
[1:33:36] uh from Eden
[1:33:38] when the Bible says God pou cherubim to
[1:33:41] guide the tree of life.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; it was these four anointings.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:33:49] He said it traveled with the with the
[1:33:51] church from Eden.
[1:33:54] When it got to revelation, John saw it
[1:33:57] before the throne.
[1:33:59] So he said the church in vision, the
[1:34:02] church has already arrived.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the church came.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Because in vision, John already saw
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; these cherubans before the throne of
[1:34:16] God. Yeah.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelation. So the church
[1:34:21] traveled all through the ages and they
[1:34:23] were protected under these anointings.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Every prophet that ever came through the
[1:34:30] Bible operated under one of these
[1:34:33] anointing.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah was called the weeping prophet.
[1:34:38] He was an ox.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:47] Now, so it was it was an anointing that
[1:34:50] gathered the church and is guiding the
[1:34:52] church today.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; The church is locked in the middle of
[1:34:59] these four beasts.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; No devil can enter.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; That is the reason why it's a mystical
[1:35:10] body.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; The church is not your local structure.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:16] where you can count and judge one
[1:35:18] another by your by your your your human
[1:35:21] mind.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; The church is a mystical body.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; One is here, one is there, you know, and
[1:35:34] and God have his people here and there
[1:35:36] and and and and in what he's doing. So
[1:35:39] you see uh uh uh we we want to talk
[1:35:43] about a train. His train filled the
[1:35:45] temple. You can you can cut this. Put
[1:35:47] the light on a little bit for us. Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; His train filled the temple. That's what
[1:35:53] I want to go this morning.
[1:35:56] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon say his train the angels
[1:36:01] those being his train that follow him is
[1:36:04] the train that fill the temple.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Now you look at that word train.
[1:36:13] If you look at the word train,
[1:36:19] the word train
[1:36:22] means border.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; It means border.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:36:36] And if you look at the word,
[1:36:39] it also tells you that
[1:36:44] the word train
[1:36:47] and and the word
[1:36:50] the hem of his garment
[1:36:54] both of them
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; comes from the sea.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:08] Glory be to God.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Let me let me uh uh
[1:37:27] let's read Numbers chapter 15.
[1:37:32] This is uh this is a old thing. It's
[1:37:35] just that I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:37:38] kind of uh
[1:37:41] do a review with you because sometimes
[1:37:44] you speak on some things that go over
[1:37:45] the heads of the people. Praise the
[1:37:47] Lord.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:53] Numbers chapter 15 when you read verse
[1:37:55] 38 and 39.
[1:38:00] Numb chapter 15 verse 38 and 39. 37 And
[1:38:04] the Lord spake to Moses saying speak
[1:38:07] unto the children of Israel and bid them
[1:38:09] that they make fringes in the border of
[1:38:13] their garment. The fringes in the border
[1:38:16] of their garment is the hem. When you
[1:38:20] hem your your your clothes,
[1:38:24] you he have to lose this one because it
[1:38:26] looks like I'm growing. Amen.
[1:38:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; So the the the hand of your of your
[1:38:35] clothes.
[1:38:37] So God is telling them here that uh you
[1:38:41] know they should make fringes in the
[1:38:42] border of their garment. It must just
[1:38:45] not be loose. You must make a fringe
[1:38:49] throughout their generation.
[1:38:52] and that they put upon the fringes of uh
[1:38:57] of the border
[1:38:59] uh a ribbon of blue
[1:39:02] and they should put a blue ribbon. Now
[1:39:05] you will see that's where
[1:39:08] as I was as I was telling this that is
[1:39:10] where the military took their straps
[1:39:14] that they put here
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; to show rank
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; because back there the hem of the
[1:39:22] garment in the way it was designed show
[1:39:25] whether this person was a priest or this
[1:39:27] person was a king.
[1:39:30] It shows royalty.
[1:39:34] Amen.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; It shows I mean uh you can know that
[1:39:37] this person is from a wealthy family
[1:39:39] because the kind of a fabric they are
[1:39:42] using to make the hem of their garment
[1:39:44] is not a cheap fabric. So it shows rank.
[1:39:47] That's what I want to say.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:53] And then over time you know uh uh people
[1:39:57] started using it for for for different
[1:39:59] design and and and uh and the military
[1:40:02] use their you know their their stripes.
[1:40:05] That's what it's called their stripes on
[1:40:07] their rank.
[1:40:09] Are we together?
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; But God is telling them that they they
[1:40:12] have to do that all through their
[1:40:14] generation. Verse 39. It shall be made
[1:40:19] uh uh uh it shall be unto you for a
[1:40:23] French that they may look upon it and
[1:40:26] remember all the commandments of the
[1:40:29] Lord
[1:40:30] and do them and that they seek not after
[1:40:34] their own heart and uh
[1:40:39] and your own eyes after which ye used to
[1:40:43] go worry. What does that means now? It
[1:40:47] was a form of meditation. The people are
[1:40:50] walking. They must be looking at the hem
[1:40:52] of their garment, remembering the
[1:40:55] promises of God, remembering the
[1:40:57] commandments of God. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you see, yeah, brother
[1:41:02] Brandham said there was no commandment
[1:41:05] in the Bible that says when you touch
[1:41:08] the hem of his garment, you will be
[1:41:10] healed. It was not a commmenting.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:14] But with with that being seen, we see
[1:41:18] here in the in the in the scripture that
[1:41:21] there was a blessing that was attached
[1:41:24] to it. And what the blessing is that is
[1:41:27] going to create a meditation for the
[1:41:29] believer to keep his mind on the
[1:41:32] promises that your mind will not go
[1:41:34] worrying.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; You will not just be thinking about
[1:41:37] unnecessary things. You having something
[1:41:40] that you are keeping your mind on. David
[1:41:43] said, "I set the law before me."
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; So even though it was not a physical, it
[1:41:55] was not a physical commandment or a
[1:41:58] written commandment that if you touch
[1:42:00] the hem of the garment, you will be
[1:42:02] healed. But this woman knows that God
[1:42:05] has put his his his commandment. He has
[1:42:08] put his word on the borders of their
[1:42:12] clothes.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; That's inspiration.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; When an inspiration get a hold of a
[1:42:19] person.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Just like the shimina woman that had the
[1:42:25] inspiration and she said all is well.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; That was her inspiration.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Her child is lying dead and cold. But
[1:42:33] her inspiration when anybody ask me I
[1:42:35] will say all is well until I get to meet
[1:42:38] the prophet.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; So the woman with the blood issue also
[1:42:42] had an inspiration that if I can touch
[1:42:45] the hem of his garment I know I will be
[1:42:48] healed.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Now see what happened. When David was
[1:42:58] running away from Saul, he was hiding in
[1:43:00] the mountain. He was able to sneak into
[1:43:04] the man of Saul and what he did he
[1:43:07] caught
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; saw garment. You know what he did? He
[1:43:11] caught the he of his garment.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; So what does that means? When he came he
[1:43:19] stood on the mountain and he shout to
[1:43:22] Abna. He says he says he says what what
[1:43:24] a what a what a defense a weak defense
[1:43:27] you have. How can you be a captain? I I
[1:43:30] have the life of your master in my
[1:43:32] hands.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; I can even show it to you. But the hem
[1:43:37] of his clothes.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; You know what that means?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; It means that his covering was
[1:43:46] destroyed.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Ruth went into the field of
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Boas,
[1:43:58] You know what she did? She took the hem
[1:44:00] of his garment
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; and she covered herself.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because she wanted to be redeemed.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; She wanted a covering.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; She said, "I feel naked in the land. I
[1:44:20] don't have a covering. I need a
[1:44:23] redeemer.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I need a man to cover me.
[1:44:27] Oh my goodness.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; brother.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; So you see that is that is there is a is
[1:44:46] uh is is is in the scripture. And now
[1:44:48] the reason why I'm coming to this
[1:44:50] because uh uh watch seven is always a
[1:44:55] mystery.
[1:44:56] Amen.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; This is the part maybe when I share this
[1:45:00] with you then I can preach what I want
[1:45:01] to preach if I still have time.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now so what what is happening here
[1:45:10] is that the uh
[1:45:14] revelation chapter 10
[1:45:16] revelation chapter 10. Let's go back to
[1:45:19] Revelation chapter 10 verse one.
[1:45:23] Revelation chapter 10.
[1:45:27] All saints of God, people of God, praise
[1:45:30] the Lord.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; I might not be your favorite preacher.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Uh maybe my message, you know, you don't
[1:45:40] connect with it. You know, everybody is
[1:45:41] designed with certain certain different
[1:45:44] preachers, but I want to testify this
[1:45:47] morning. Amen.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; I want to testify this morning.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; I want to testify this morning.
[1:45:54] Hallelujah.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse one, "And I saw
[1:45:59] another mighty angel come down from
[1:46:02] heaven clothed with a cloud,
[1:46:05] and the rainbow
[1:46:07] was upon his head,
[1:46:10] and his face was as the sun,
[1:46:15] and his feet
[1:46:17] as the pillow of fire." This this
[1:46:20] scripture hit me one day.
[1:46:24] It hit me one day so hard.
[1:46:27] And uh
[1:46:30] you know I share with you when God came
[1:46:33] down to Moses
[1:46:35] in the burning bush, she said, "Take off
[1:46:37] your shoes for I've come down." Amen.
[1:46:42] Amen.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; And and and and we learned that that
[1:46:45] that that symbol of taking of the shoes
[1:46:48] was a was a language of redemption.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Because the king's man had to take off
[1:46:55] his shoes. In a Jewish culture, if he
[1:46:58] could not redeem the woman, then you
[1:47:00] take off your shoes. Let the man that is
[1:47:02] redeeming a woman put on the shoes.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; And that's why we take in our language,
[1:47:07] you are not in my shoes. If you were
[1:47:09] only in my shoes, you would know what
[1:47:11] I'm going through. It's a redemptive
[1:47:14] language.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And yet we see that Revelation 10 is
[1:47:21] identifying this mighted angel that his
[1:47:25] feet
[1:47:26] is like what?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; A pillar of fire.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; So whenever you see the pillar of fire,
[1:47:38] you have just seen his feet.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; He's He's just He has just stepped down.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had just stepped down. The
[1:47:52] Bible said he says the heaven is the is
[1:47:54] my throne. The earth is my foottool.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we see there in
[1:48:00] Houston and and uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:48:05] brother F A F A F A F A F A F A F A F A
[1:48:05] F A F A FB bus defending uh uh uh divine
[1:48:09] healing. Praise the Lord.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Divine healing and Dr. Bess is
[1:48:14] challenging divine healing that there's
[1:48:17] nothing like divine healing and and all
[1:48:19] of that. And then we we we realize here
[1:48:22] that uh uh uh you know the argument goes
[1:48:25] on and uh brother FF boss were
[1:48:29] challenging with the redemptive names.
[1:48:31] You know if they if they relate to Jesus
[1:48:33] Christ he could not defend there. He
[1:48:35] just going all over the place and we see
[1:48:37] that God I mean brother Brandon comes
[1:48:40] out. He called brother Brandon to the
[1:48:41] pulpit and the way that I think about it
[1:48:44] then is that you know God taking a
[1:48:47] picture stepping down. God stepping
[1:48:49] down.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; And as he's coming down, the the the the
[1:48:54] the
[1:48:57] flash of the camera grab his foot
[1:48:59] because his feet is like a pillar of
[1:49:01] fire.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Now, but if if you look into that also,
[1:49:05] you will see that Revelation chapter 10
[1:49:08] verse1 give us a complete description of
[1:49:12] this angel. It kind of it it just bring
[1:49:15] his entire identity.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; It tell it tells us of a cloud, you
[1:49:23] know, uh uh uh around his head. It tells
[1:49:26] of a of his face and it tells of his
[1:49:29] feet. So it's a it's a complete identity
[1:49:32] of this mighty angel. Amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now so uh uh and and and in our
[1:49:43] day and age there you see that uh uh of
[1:49:46] of one of the thing that is so argued
[1:49:49] and fuss about. I will get into my
[1:49:51] message. Uh Emmanuel put my my picture
[1:49:54] up of the cloud.
[1:49:57] Now remember now remember that his train
[1:50:01] No, not that one. The next one. Yes. Now
[1:50:05] remember now that his train that filled
[1:50:08] the temple, that train
[1:50:12] that filled the temple was the blending
[1:50:15] of the angels wings.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Just like in a physical uh uh uh in a
[1:50:25] physical demonstration, we lock our
[1:50:27] hands together
[1:50:30] to create a a cycle in the middle.
[1:50:35] When you when you go back and read
[1:50:37] Ezekiel and and and and Revelation, you
[1:50:40] you realize that uh uh uh uh that that
[1:50:44] description that Isaiah gave that his
[1:50:47] train filled the temple is the locking
[1:50:50] of the angel's wings.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; So these clouds that were that were
[1:50:54] formed there in Arizona where the angels
[1:50:58] spreading their wings.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Seven angels spreading their wings.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Now, so just like how over in the Old
[1:51:15] Testament,
[1:51:17] praise the Lord. Just like how over in
[1:51:20] the Old Testament uh uh uh uh
[1:51:26] they were supposed to keep uh uh the
[1:51:29] commandment on the Frenches of their
[1:51:32] gab. Praise the Lord.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was a sign of a believer
[1:51:39] being covered by the word of God.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; It was a sign of the believer being
[1:51:44] covered by the presence of God.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we we see here that uh that
[1:51:51] that that that in our day in our age uh
[1:51:55] when when those seven angels came down
[1:51:57] on the mountain, it was uh you know like
[1:52:00] some Robert B say I never never really
[1:52:02] put all of these things together this
[1:52:04] morning because I was only dwelling on
[1:52:06] this so I can be able to run with what I
[1:52:08] want to preach this morning. And uh it
[1:52:10] was it was it was at a place where he
[1:52:12] says you know what uh he says uh uh he
[1:52:16] was taking a picture with us in a sense
[1:52:19] that our representation the bride
[1:52:22] representation
[1:52:24] just like how uh uh uh uh Ruth had to go
[1:52:29] on the the the the border of uh uh Bo's
[1:52:34] garment.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the same where this these
[1:52:38] these angels come spreading their wings
[1:52:40] and and as their train filled the
[1:52:43] heavens.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; In the locking of their wings.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; The train that filled the temple bar say
[1:52:53] and then just above it were the
[1:52:54] saraphins.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; You read through the message. He said
[1:52:58] that over and over. I was just looking
[1:53:00] at few of that uh uh just before
[1:53:05] uh yeah in uh unchanging God himself. I
[1:53:09] don't have that up there so don't look
[1:53:11] for it. When when he seen the the the
[1:53:13] train of the Lord I saw angels flying
[1:53:17] through the building with wings over

[1:57:44] that you have to get a menu how you read
[1:57:46] in the morning you know and and and it
[1:57:49] is just all man driven. No this whole

[1:58:17] from the Philistines
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; because they send the ark back with a
[1:58:21] card. He was copying from the
[1:58:22] denominations. And that's what the
[1:58:24] church try to do today. We copy from the
[1:58:27] denominations. You know, they can do
[1:58:28] like this. Their services is like this.
[1:58:31] We must go to the prophet.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; We must get a word of God. Amen. because

[1:58:56] Now he went back and Nathan instructed
[1:58:58] him that you have to get men that you
[1:59:01] know that that are ordained of God and
[1:59:03] they must take the ark of the Lord on
[1:59:05] their shoulder. No more C. Now David
[1:59:08] followed the prophet here. He's coming
[1:59:10] back. And the Bible says here that uh
[1:59:14] after the men that were ordained to
[1:59:17] carry the ark, after they have took six,
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; one,
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; two,
[1:59:27] three,
[1:59:29] four,
[1:59:30] five,
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; six, he broke the other. Watch. See what
[1:59:36] happened
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; after the talk
[1:59:42] six
[1:59:49] and and and it was so verse 13 that when
[1:59:52] they that bear the ark of the Lord has

[1:59:59] fatling.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[2:00:05] all of his might.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Now follow me now in a little bit. You
[2:00:10] will see what I'm going to hear. And and
[2:00:12] he danced before the Lord with all of
[2:00:14] his might. And David was g with a
[2:00:18] leaning epher. And that was something
[2:00:21] that the priest had to work.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; So David was king and priest.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But you see, he was gather
[2:00:32] with the leaning epher. Let me wear my
[2:00:34] coat on the wrong side.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; But he was not walking like a Levitical
[2:00:40] priest.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; He had the epher, but this man was
[2:00:43] dancing with the epher.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness me.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:59] The Bible says, "And he danced before
[2:01:01] the Lord with all of his might, and
[2:01:03] David was gain and Epher.
[2:01:07] So David and all the house of Israel
[2:01:10] brought up the ark of the Lord, with
[2:01:14] shouting
[2:01:17] and with sounds of trumpet."
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; He brought all
[2:01:28] all of that with shouting
[2:01:31] and sounds of trumpet.
[2:01:35] Are we together?
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; I'm kind of looking for something here
[2:01:42] because u uh where do I have it?
[2:01:49] Okay.
[2:01:51] Yeah, it stay in the reading here.
[2:01:53] Now uh uh
[2:01:58] and as the ark of as the ark of the Lord
[2:02:00] came into the city uh uh Michelle saw
[2:02:04] daughter looked through the window and
[2:02:06] saw the king leaping and dancing before
[2:02:10] the Lord and she despised him in in uh
[2:02:13] her heart. and they brought the ark of
[2:02:16] the Lord and set it in his place in the
[2:02:21] midst of the tabernacle that David pitch
[2:02:25] for it. Now, so this is where the
[2:02:29] tabernacle of David was dedicated,
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; the bringing back of the ark,
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; which is the word of the Lord, the
[2:02:41] presence of God.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; David was bringing back the ark. But
[2:02:47] before he brought back the ark, he has
[2:02:50] already built a tabernacle.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; He was not taking the ark back to that
[2:02:55] old temple
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; of sadness and gloom.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; No, he was not carrying it back to
[2:03:01] Jerusalem of silence and gloom. So even
[2:03:04] the priests that were carrying the
[2:03:06] tabernacle, they were all they were all
[2:03:08] shocked
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; because this man is wearing an epher.
[2:03:12] When you put that epher on as a high
[2:03:14] priest, the Bible say you got to wash
[2:03:16] your steps
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; as you going into the holiness of holy
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; because one misstep
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; you will drop and die.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; But David not even knowing whether it's
[2:03:26] left and right. He's dancing all over
[2:03:27] the place.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; He's wearing the high he wearing the
[2:03:33] high priest ea.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; So he's he's changing the order.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because after the six is a mystery.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; The the tabernacle of David has been
[2:03:47] birthed in the midst of the people.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; It changed the order.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; You see, when a woman at the word met
[2:03:54] the seven men,
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; what happened? It changed her order. The
[2:03:58] Bible say she ran into the street. The
[2:04:01] thing that she couldn't do when she were
[2:04:04] with the six men, now when she met the
[2:04:06] seven men, she can do it.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:10] Amen.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Just when it took six steps
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; right there, David,
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; stop there. Let's stop right here.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; This is a new day.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; This is a new message.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; This is not your old denomination.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; No. This is a new message. This is a new
[2:04:37] day. Amen.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; And the tabernacle of David was
[2:04:46] dedicated. He dedicated the tabernacle
[2:04:49] by breaking the ark of the Lord.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch, watch and see what

[2:05:03] little bit.

[2:05:07] close and then the next day we preach.
[2:05:08] Amen.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in and uh
[2:05:17] verse 17 and the brother act of the Lord
[2:05:20] and set it in the place in the midst of
[2:05:22] the tabernacle that David has pitched
[2:05:24] for it. And David offer burnt offering
[2:05:28] and peace offering before the Lord. And
[2:05:31] as soon as David has made an end of
[2:05:34] offering,
[2:05:36] offering and peace offering, burnt
[2:05:37] offering and peace offering,
[2:05:40] he blessed the people in the name of the
[2:05:43] Lord of hosts.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; And he dw among the people
[2:05:49] even among the whole multitude
[2:05:52] as well to the women as men. Now let me
[2:05:57] explain this for you so you will really
[2:05:59] understand what is happening here.
[2:06:01] Because in the Levitical
[2:06:05] temple,
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; the people were separated.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; The people stopped in the altar court.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; It was only the priest that came in the
[2:06:19] inner court.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; And the high priest goes in the holiest
[2:06:23] of holies.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; In this tabernacle that David built,
[2:06:27] there is no inner, there is no altar.
[2:06:29] It's open for everybody.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; There is no seat for women. There is no
[2:06:35] seat for men. It's open for everybody.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; So, in the tabernacle of David, he's
[2:06:42] giving the people a direct access.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Direct access to the presence of God.
[2:06:49] You don't have to go through a mother or
[2:06:51] a father or a bishop or a priest. You
[2:06:54] have the act of God right there. You can
[2:06:57] go there and get an answer from God.

[2:07:13] That's what they would do in the altar
[2:07:15] call.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Then the people in the holiest of holies
[2:07:21] will have to sit back and wait.

[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; And then the priest will be the one that
[2:08:01] will go into the holy place.

[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; There was no trinity now. There was no
[2:10:15] father, son, holy ghost. The name has
[2:10:17] been revealed. All has become one.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Right there before the people.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; The angels bow before him.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth adore him. Right.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; So the the the the
[2:10:52] tabernacle of David was birthed right
[2:10:54] there. The tabernacle of David was
[2:10:57] established by the return of the word,
[2:11:00] the return of the ark.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; So you see that's the reason why we put
[2:11:06] our feelings and our ideas, they must
[2:11:09] all be behind the word.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Because that's
[2:11:15] what brings us into the presence of God.
[2:11:17] When God came down in in in Eden and he
[2:11:20] was reconciling Adam back, he was not uh
[2:11:24] having, you know, the sheep skin behind
[2:11:26] him and trying to hide it from Adam. No,
[2:11:28] man would never come in the presence of
[2:11:30] God until they come through the blood.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; So, he had to have that that that lamb
[2:11:35] before him and saying, "Adam, Adam,
[2:11:38] where are you?" The first thing you see
[2:11:39] is the blood. Amen. The first thing you
[2:11:42] see if uh if Christianity will ever mean
[2:11:45] anything to you, the first thing you see
[2:11:47] is not a church. The first thing you see
[2:11:49] is not a prophet. The first thing you
[2:11:51] see is Calvary.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Is if Calvary has not reached to your
[2:11:56] heart. You are just making another
[2:11:58] religion. You are just a religious
[2:12:00] person. The first thing we see is the
[2:12:02] lamb that died for our sin.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; That was the first thing that he show
[2:12:09] and Eve. That is the thing that matters
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; because that's the thing that brings you
[2:12:14] back into fellowship. That's the thing
[2:12:16] that reconcile you with God.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; It's not what church you go, what your
[2:12:20] pastor name, how many members you have.
[2:12:22] It does not reconcile you with God. The
[2:12:24] thing that reconcile you with God is the
[2:12:25] bleeding word.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; So that was the first thing, the return
[2:12:35] of the word, the act. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; When the word came,
[2:12:42] then that was when praise and worship
[2:12:44] followed.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; So praise and worship do not dictate to
[2:12:50] the word.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; It's the word that dictate how we
[2:12:53] worship.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Well, because we are worshiping the
[2:12:59] word.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Christ is the word.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; So, he dictates how we worship.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So we see here David
[2:13:09] when he brought the eye he got into
[2:13:11] prison worship you know h prison worship
[2:13:15] was introduced vincing before the lord
[2:13:18] David took deity
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; above
[2:13:26] his dignity
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; he took the deity of god
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; the god that led our fathers
[2:13:38] The God that told Abraham to build this
[2:13:40] ark
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; and that the commandment should be laid
[2:13:44] in it. He took the word of God above his
[2:13:48] dignity.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; When her wife was thinking that she's a
[2:13:54] type of the church, that's why the
[2:13:56] church is dead today.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; That's why the church is buried today.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; When she thought that, well, yeah, you
[2:14:04] know, he's a he's a man. He you're
[2:14:06] supposed to know that as a king there's
[2:14:07] a way you have to behave. That's the
[2:14:09] way. And we become so particular about
[2:14:11] ourself, our personalities and and what
[2:14:14] have you. David talk the deity of God.
[2:14:17] He talk the returning of God's presence
[2:14:20] back in the midst of the people. He took
[2:14:22] that above his dignity.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; What I'm a king. He says he says I
[2:14:27] remember you took me from the ship
[2:14:29] court.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; You took me from the ship court
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; when I never had a name. I never knew
[2:14:34] anything.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; My life was a waste. You took me and the
[2:14:38] God that have taken us. Now we take our
[2:14:40] dignity. We become so proud and we
[2:14:43] trashing his name.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Because we think we have achieved. We
[2:14:48] have arrived.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; David told the deity of God.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God. What a God he is.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; He told his wife, "You never see
[2:14:59] nothing.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; You thought I was You thought I was
[2:15:01] messing around. and you have not seen
[2:15:03] nothing. I'm not going back to that old
[2:15:05] dare tabernacle. No, I'm coming toward
[2:15:08] the presence of God where I have the
[2:15:11] liberty to worship God,
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; the liberty to jump, to shout, to praise
[2:15:16] God.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; He told his his uh h the deity of God.
[2:15:30] What a mighty God he is
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; that we will compare oursel to him to
[2:15:35] even to even think that we can ask him
[2:15:37] question who are you
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; who are you to think that you can even
[2:15:43] question him
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; oh what almighty God we serve
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; after six pieces
[2:15:59] the seven was a mystery
[2:16:01] the tabernacle of David was born, the
[2:16:04] tabernacle that would come to the
[2:16:05] Gentiles.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Because in the old tabernacle, only Jews
[2:16:13] could go there.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; But in this tabernacle of David, it was
[2:16:16] both Jews and Gentiles.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why God promised, I
[2:16:23] will rebuild the tabernacle of David.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we say we we have the
[2:16:30] message of the hour. You say that you
[2:16:32] have seen the act of God in this day.
[2:16:34] No, no, no. You stay in that old
[2:16:36] Levitical tabernacle. If you are seeing
[2:16:39] the act of God in this day, it will
[2:16:40] affect your worship. It will affect your
[2:16:43] attitude in the presence of God.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why should you matter what
[2:16:51] somebody would think? If you want to
[2:16:52] express yourself to God, express
[2:16:54] yourself anyhow.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of David was born. Listen
[2:17:06] to what Bram will say right here in uh
[2:17:09] unveiling of God. He says, "Behold the
[2:17:12] old tabernacle in the veil.
[2:17:15] What was back behind the veil?" We know
[2:17:18] the old tabernacle had a veil. The
[2:17:21] presence of God was hid from the people.
[2:17:23] You are worshiping a God. You can't see
[2:17:25] it.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's just all in your mind.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; We are worshiping a God that we have
[2:17:33] created for ourself.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; It's behind the veil.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; But in this tabernacle of David, there
[2:17:41] is no veil.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; No veil. It's a It's an open tent.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Come unto me all you that labor and have
[2:17:50] heavy laden. And I will give you rest.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:18:00] Behold the old temple in the veil. What
[2:18:02] was back behind there? What was what was
[2:18:06] Jehovah? What was hid back there? What
[2:18:10] was the veil hiding? Oh, hallelujah.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; What was the veil hiding? It was hiding
[2:18:17] the word.
[2:18:19] The veil the old Badgers king was hiding
[2:18:24] hiding the word
[2:18:26] to their eyes natural behind there.
[2:18:30] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see when when even when our
[2:18:34] Lord Jesus came,
[2:18:37] the only time the Bible recorded that he
[2:18:39] went to the temple, he went right toward
[2:18:41] the the the seat that was kept for the
[2:18:44] Messiah. Luke chapter 4. Because they
[2:18:47] kept that seat for the Messiah that when
[2:18:49] the Messiah come, he went right to that
[2:18:50] seat. That's where the Bible say he took
[2:18:53] the book and he ran from where Isaiah
[2:18:55] said the spirit of the Lord God is upon
[2:18:56] me. He closed the book, gave it to the
[2:18:58] high priest and he sat down in that
[2:19:00] seat.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; He never went to the tabernacle.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the tabernacle was hiding
[2:19:09] God from the people
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; and he was here to reveal God to the
[2:19:12] people.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:16] Amen.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why he did not he
[2:19:18] didn't it didn't matter to him whether
[2:19:20] he met them on the beach whether he
[2:19:22] called Zakius from the tree whether he
[2:19:24] stood in a boat to preach. He was so he
[2:19:27] was to declare God to the people
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; not bring people to a house like the
[2:19:32] door
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; and gave certain seat to certain people
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; and they think they are privileged.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Whenever he went to the to to their
[2:19:47] tabernacle, he was he was always out of
[2:19:50] order.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; The last time he show he show up with
[2:19:54] awake.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Every time he show up to their to their
[2:20:01] temple, he will always out of order.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; He show up with a whip and he's kicking
[2:20:07] all the table and he's whipping the
[2:20:08] people out of the place.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's saying you are you are
[2:20:13] hiding God from the people. He's a
[2:20:16] living God. He's not a God you can box
[2:20:19] in the corner. He's not a God you can
[2:20:21] keep behind tradition. He's a living God
[2:20:24] living among his people.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's not a God only for
[2:20:30] Sunday morning. He's a God for Monday
[2:20:33] morning. He's a God for Tuesday in the
[2:20:35] street.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just a God where we wear
[2:20:42] our best suit and put on our best
[2:20:44] behavior. He's a God even when we are in
[2:20:46] our worst moment. He's still a living
[2:20:49] God that live among his people.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; My my my
[2:21:15] the ve the old badger of skin was hiding
[2:21:18] hiding the word to their eyes naturally
[2:21:20] behind there also was the shortbread and
[2:21:23] uh and and you you just go down and read
[2:21:25] read down a little bit here the Bible
[2:21:27] says see what what David would do here
[2:21:29] this this man David this man David he's
[2:21:32] a radical amen
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; he's a radical and I believe that's why
[2:21:38] God is looking for men and women that
[2:21:40] just radical.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Radical to the devil. Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; He's a radical. See what he did here.
[2:21:47] The Bible says, "And as soon as David
[2:21:49] has made an end of offering, the burn
[2:21:51] offering and the peace offering. He
[2:21:53] blessed the people
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord. And uh he dw
[2:21:57] among the people. He were not in some
[2:21:59] kind of special corner or behind say
[2:22:01] y'all wait for me. Yeah, let me go." No,
[2:22:03] no, no. He dwell among the people.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; It was different.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; No curtains.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:10] Hallelujah.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; He dwelt among the people.
[2:22:13] He dwelt among all the people even among
[2:22:15] the whole multitude as well as the
[2:22:18] women. As it was it was important for
[2:22:21] them to put it here as the women as the
[2:22:23] men.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; To everyone a cake of bread.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; This is the short bread.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; That's supposed to be eaten only by the
[2:22:36] priest. Yeah,
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; This is the short bread that's supposed
[2:22:41] to be his first day of service.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; David is doing communion.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; His first service is having dedicating
[2:22:52] the church.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; At the same time, he's doing communion.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; Everything is happening right there and
[2:22:59] then.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's the tabernacle of David.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; That's the tabernacle of David. That's
[2:23:08] the reason why the the the the the the
[2:23:11] church at the beginning the Bible says
[2:23:13] they went from house to house b breaking
[2:23:16] bread. Every service they met was a
[2:23:18] communion.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; All this thing where you where we have
[2:23:22] to go and prepare ourself or I I need to
[2:23:24] wash my life. Oh, I need to consecrate
[2:23:26] myself. And every service they met if
[2:23:28] they were meeting five days in a week
[2:23:30] they were having communion every day.
[2:23:32] Amen.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Don't you see that the Catholic church
[2:23:35] took that?
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Every time they meet
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; in their Catholic with their Catholic
[2:23:39] doc, they still have communion. Where
[2:23:40] they took it from? From the early
[2:23:41] church.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; And now we must make it on first Sunday
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; or quiet Saturday.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is this is not first Sunday.
[2:23:54] Why are we having communion?
[2:23:56] And even as message people, we are
[2:23:58] dragging this dogma with us.
[2:24:00] [Music]
[2:24:02] Whether it's an evening service, whether
[2:24:04] it's a it's a Wednesday service, every
[2:24:06] service is good for communion.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Because what is the communion? The
[2:24:10] breaking of the word.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; It's the community. It's the word.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Well, we have we have to announce

[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; His first service.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; He's not even asking the people when you
[2:24:41] get converted.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; Who are your pastor when you got
[2:24:44] baptized?
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; He's not even asking them.
[2:24:52] sit in the seat of comfort and we are
[2:24:54] just examining people live. Look at this
[2:24:56] other one for the communion. Look at
[2:24:57] this other one.
[2:25:15] We'll preach another time. Let me just
[2:25:17] read.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; And he dwared among all the people, even
[2:25:22] among all the whole multitude of Israel,
[2:25:24] as well as women as men, to everyone a
[2:25:28] cake and a good piece of flesh and
[2:25:31] flaggings of wine.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; So all the people departed, everyone
[2:25:38] to his house.
[2:25:41] He did a communion right at the end of
[2:25:43] the service.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; After the worship has gone, the trumpets
[2:25:47] were blown.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; The praise rang.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; The people shouted.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; They expressed themselves.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God. He said,
[2:26:07] What a mighty God we serve.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. It's always a mystery.
[2:26:16] When God bring you when God breath you
[2:26:18] into your seven,
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; all this statchiness and and and
[2:26:22] stubbornness that we think we are,
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; wait and wait and see. Let the uh let
[2:26:26] let he bring you to that place. Amen.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; It was it was just it was just seasonal.
[2:26:33] Like I said Wednesday night is not
[2:26:35] something it's not something that you
[2:26:36] calculate him by your human mind. No,
[2:26:38] you just follow the Lord.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; These men were following the Lord. They
[2:26:41] were under the inspiration of the Holy
[2:26:43] Ghost. Not even knowing these things.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; They never even had an idea that in
[2:26:48] God's mind seven was very special to
[2:26:51] him. They never had it.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; They were just doing what they were
[2:26:54] doing earnestly serving God.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; And he brought them into that place.
[2:27:02] He broke them into that place.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Of serving God is sweet.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; It's very sweet. I mean I mean having a
[2:27:09] relationship
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; when you having a relationship where you
[2:27:12] know that this God is your buddy. He's
[2:27:15] there. He has your back.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; Not looking over your shoulder who
[2:27:20] watching who they say what they think.
[2:27:23] It does not bother me
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; by his grace.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I will I'll ever be grateful
[2:27:30] to this church of having me your pastor
[2:27:32] send me out of that door. I'll be on the
[2:27:34] next flight.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; I'll be on the next flight down to
[2:27:38] Zambia for the revival or I'll be I will
[2:27:41] be gone. Amen. I just need to give my
[2:27:43] wife a kiss. She will take care of the
[2:27:44] children.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:28:05] Are we together?
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; You know, I was I was I was just I was
[2:28:12] sharing just something uh uh in our
[2:28:15] little fellowship yesterday, brother
[2:28:16] Brown, talking about uh uh uh the Holy
[2:28:19] Ghost. What is the Holy Ghost? You know,
[2:28:20] and then he's praying right there at the
[2:28:22] beginning of of what is the Holy Ghost?
[2:28:24] He says uh he says oh Lord we have the
[2:28:26] privilege to be here you know to uh uh
[2:28:29] to bring the people to the kingdom he
[2:28:31] said all to take the kingdom to the
[2:28:33] people.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; In a message in his presence when he
[2:28:40] talk about Isaiah he says what what was
[2:28:43] doing when those angels came down and
[2:28:45] pick him up into that constellation took
[2:28:47] a code of fire and sanctify his mouth.
[2:28:50] He said he was taking the presence of
[2:28:51] God to the people. That's what the Holy
[2:28:54] Ghost is. That's what the message of the
[2:28:56] hour is.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Not some kind of a doctrine where we
[2:28:59] stick on our chest. We are message
[2:29:01] believer. It's taking the presence of
[2:29:03] God.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; God must birth you into that.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; You can't impersonate it. You disgrace
[2:29:14] yourself.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; He must birth you into that.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; They wait upon the Lord.
[2:29:22] to renew their strength.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery. It's always a
[2:29:34] mystery.
[2:29:36] From the first day, God worked. He said
[2:29:38] it was good. The second day, the tear,
[2:29:40] the fourth, the fifth. The sixth day,
[2:29:42] the seven was a mystery.
[2:29:46] The Bible say he rested.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; It was a mystery. How did he rest? Where
[2:29:50] did he rest? Uh
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; He was not renting h comfort in hotel
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; or putting a mat under the man under a
[2:30:01] tree.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; He was resting in a man.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; He was taking rest in a man.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the reason why
[2:30:11] Adam could speak gave those things the
[2:30:13] name. Exactly what? Because God was
[2:30:15] resting in him. That's why the Holy
[2:30:17] Ghost is called our rest.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:21] Amen.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Watch the sermon is always a mystery.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; It take you beyond your church
[2:30:26] knowledge,
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; your religious knowledge.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Everything you have kept and you you've
[2:30:34] been believing that is right. When you
[2:30:36] get in the seven,
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; when you get in the seven,
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; amen. Amen.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; You became you become like a child. You
[2:30:46] cry like Isaiah, "Woe is me.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; I'm undone.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips. This is a
[2:30:53] prophet of God.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; This is a man that had the gift of
[2:30:56] vision."
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; But yet when he bought when he broke
[2:30:59] into that seven, Lord.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm unworthy.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips."
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Amen.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; This is not a Bible school.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; This is not intellectual speech.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; No, sir.

[2:31:23] building.

[2:31:27] your body.

[2:33:27] we are living in the presence of the
[2:33:29] king."
