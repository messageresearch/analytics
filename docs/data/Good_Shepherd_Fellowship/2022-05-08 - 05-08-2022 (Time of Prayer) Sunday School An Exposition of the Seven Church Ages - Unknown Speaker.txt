TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so is as many as i love in the greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun i he does not say as many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is the many that are the loved ones of god it is his love in question not ours so once again we find ourselves glorying in his salvation his purpose and his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of god even as he said in romans 9 13 jacob have i loved does it now obtain that since he loved only the many is he therefore in a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn nigh him by no means is this so for he declared also in romans 9 13 he saw have i hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth this love is elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from human merit for it says that the purpose of god stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself because before the children were born he had already said jacob have i loved but esau have i hated and now he says to his own as many as i love i rebuke and chasten to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction json does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind this is exactly what we find in hebrews 12 5-11 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if he be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then you are bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby herein is now set forth the love of god he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons sons like himself there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to his image and their walk he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail-scarred hands sometimes this potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be oh little flock do not fear this age is fast closing as it does those tears will be bound together and as a threefold court is not easily broken they will have a tremendous threefold strength of political physical and spiritual satanical power and they will seek to destroy the bride of christ she will suffer but she will endure fear not those things that are coming upon the earth for he who loved his own loveth them unto the end john 13 1 be zealous and repent now this false church has zeal make no mistake about that her zeal has literally been that of the jews john 2 17 the zeal of thine house have eaten me up but it is a wrong zeal it is for the house of their own building it is for their own creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness they have put the word out for their own ideas they deposed the holy ghost and made man into leaders they have put aside eternal life as a person and make it good works or even church conformity rather than good works but god is calling for another zeal it is the zeal to cry i am wrong now who is going to say that he is wrong what is it that all these denominations are based upon the claim to originality and that of god the claim that they are right now they all cannot be right in fact not one of them is right they are white sepulchers full of dead men's bones they have no life they have no vindication god has never made himself known in any organization they say they are right because they are the ones that are saying it but saying it does not make it so they need the vindicated thus saith the lord of god and they don't have it now let me say this here i don't believe that god is calling only to the false church to repent in this verse he is talking to his elect they have some repenting to do too many of his children are still in those false churches they are those of whom it speaks in ephesians 5 14. awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light to be asleep is not to be dead these are sleeping amongst the dead they are out there in the dead denominations they are floating along with them god cries out wake up repent of your folly here they are lending their influence giving their time and their money actually their very lives to these antichrist organizations and all the while thinking it is all right they need to repent they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn toward truth yes this is the age that most needs to repent but will it will it bring back the word will it again enthrone the holy spirit in men's lives will it again revere jesus as the only savior i say not for the next verse reveals the astounding and shocking truth of the close of this age christ outside the church revelation 3 20-22 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now there is a great deal of confusion over this verse because so many personal workers use it in personal evangelism as though jesus were at the hearts door of every sinner knocking for admission it would then be said that if the sinner opened the door the lord would come in but this verse is not talking to individual sinners this whole message has a summation as does every message in every age in verse 22 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches so this is the message to the church of the last age this is the condition of the laodicean church as its end nears it is not a personal message to one person it is the spirit telling us where jesus is christ has left the church is this not the logical result or end if the word is put aside for creed the holy spirit deposed for popes bishops presidents counselors etc and the savior set aside for a works program or church joining or some type of conformity to a church system what more can be done against him this is the apostasy this is the falling away this is the open door to antichrist for if one came in his father's name jesus and was not received but rejected then there will come another with his own name liar a pretender and him they will receive john 5 43 the man of sin that son of perdition will take over matthew 24 mentioned signs in the heavens concerning this last day just before jesus comes i wonder if you noticed such a sign recently fulfilled as to portray the very truth we have been discussing that truth is that jesus has been steadily pushed aside until in the last age he is pushed outside the church recall that in the first age it was almost a full orbed church of truth yet there was a little error called the deeds of the nicolaitans that kept the circle from being full then in the next stage more darkness crept in until the ball of light glowed less and darkness covered more of the circle in the third age it was eclipsed still more and in the fourth age which was the dark ages the light had all but gone now think on this the church shines in the reflected light of christ he is the sun the church is the moon thus this orb of light is the moon it had decreased from almost a full moon in the first age to a sliver in the fourth age but in the fifth age it began to grow in the sixth it took a great step of growth forward in part of the seventh age it was still growing when suddenly it stopped short and waned to almost a nothingness so that instead of light it was the blackness of apostasy and at the end of the age it had ceased to shine for darkness had taken over christ was now outside the church here is the sign in the sky the last eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse it waned to a total darkness in seven stages in the seventh stage the total darkness came as the pope of rome paul vi went to palestine to make a holy tour of jerusalem he was the first pope to ever go to jerusalem the pope is named paul the sixth paul was the first messenger and this man goes by that name notice it is the sixth or the number of man this is more than a coincidence and when he went to jerusalem the moon or the church went into total darkness this is it this is the end this generation shall not pass away until all be fulfilled even so lord jesus come quickly now we can see why there were two vines one true and one false now we can see why abraham had two sons one after the flesh that persecuted isaac and one after promise now we can see how that out of the same parents two boys came forth as twins one knowing and loving the things of god and the other knowing much of the same truth but not of the same spirit and hence persecuted the child that was elect god did not reprobate for the sake of reprobation he reprobated for the sake of the elect elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect oh those reprobates are religious they are smart they are of the cane line the serpent seed they build their babbles they build their cities they build their empires and all the while calling on god they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even in the name of the lord to destroy god's elect ones but they are needed what is the chaff to the wheat no chaff no wheat but at the end what happens to the chaff it is burned with fire unquenchable and the wheat where is it it is gathered in his garner it is where he is oh elect of god beware study closely be careful work out your salvation with fear and trembling rely upon god and be strong in his might your adversary the devil is even now going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour watch unto prayer and be steadfast this is the end time both the true and false vine are coming into maturity but before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for the burning see they are all joining the world council of churches that is the binding soon the garnering of the wheat will come but right now the two spirits are at work in two vines come out from among the tares start to overcome that you may be considered praiseworthy for your lord and fit to reign and rule with him the overcomers throne revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne now what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is logical for does it matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome a quick look at those scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail now notice again how jesus overcame the world systems of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of god in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of god in hebrews 5 7 it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word of god now then there will not be one person who will sit in the throne of the lord jesus christ unless he has been living that word your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to god none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne it will be granted only to the word bride as the throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is united to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that throne remember we have shown clearly all through the ages that even as adam and eve fell because they left the word so the ephesian age fell by turning slightly from the word until with every age continuing to turn away we have a final repudiation of the word by the world church system this laodicean age ends in a blackout of the word thereby causing a departure of the lord from the midst he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word after a short and powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with jesus the consummation of the gentile ages this age is the last of the seven church ages what began in the first or ephesian age must and will come to full fruition and harvest in the last laodicean age the two vines will yield their final fruit the two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations the sowing the watering the growing is all over summer is ended the sickle is now thrust into the harvest in verses 15 to 18 which we have just studied lies the true picture of the ripened false vine false spirit false church people i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou art cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see no words ever spelled out a more bitter denunciation and no proud and arrogant religious people ever deserved it more yet in verse 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne we find the true vine true spirit true church people exalted to the very throne of god with the highest compliment ever paid to a humble steadfast spiritual group the words of john the baptist who so accurately set forth the christ in relationship to the true and false church now comes to pass matthew 3 11-12 i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire christ the great harvester is now reaping the fruit of the earth he gathers the wheat into the garner by coming for his own and receiving them forever unto himself then he returns to destroy the wicked with fire unquenchable the mystery of the tares and wheat of matthew 13 24-30 is now also fulfilled another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sird it's not thou sow good seed in thy field from once then hath it tares he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servants said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tears ye root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn the wheat and the tears which from the first age until now have grown side by side are harvested what nicaea set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of organization the false church turns from any vestige of truth and with political might reinforces herself with state backing and sets out to eradicate forever the true believer but just when she is about to accomplish her cowardly plot the weed is gathered into the garner no longer will the wheat and tears grow side by side no longer will the tares receive the blessing of god because of the presence of the wheat for the wheat will be gone and the wrath of god will be poured out into the sixth seal which will end in the utter destruction of the wicked now i said a moment ago that the false vine came into full fruition in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil spirited church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree wherein lodged the fowls of the air at her head will be the antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bride church will mature and her ripeness shall be an identification with her lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demons of darkness come against this true vine the true vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that jesus did then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word jesus will come that the bride and groom may be forever united as one already the visible manifestations of what i have been telling you are seen all around us the ecumenical move of the tears is factual but also it is a fact that the prophet for the last age must be bringing forth a message from god that will forerun the second coming of the lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the power what crucial times are these in which we live how careful we must be that we remain true to this word and not take from it or add to it for he who would speak where god has not spoken makes him a liar what i have particularly in mind is this about the turn of the century the hunger for god that was generated in the philadelphian age brought a cry for the spirit of god and when the cry was answered by god sending forth manifestation in tongues interpretation and prophecy a group immediately and most contrary to the word drew up a doctrine that tongues was the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost tongues were far from evidence they were manifestation but not evidence the falsity of the doctrine can not only be seen by a lack of scripture to substantiate it but those who subscribe to the doctrine immediately organized on the basis of the doctrine proving that they were not in the truth as they would have people believe oh it looked good it looked like the return of pentecost but it proved it wasn't it could not be for it organized that is death not life it looked so close to the real that multitudes were deceived now if it wasn't the genuine what was it it was the husk the chaff in the green soft sheath form it looked like it was the real thing but as one can go into the field and see what looks exactly like wheat and yet is only the husk for the wheat seed has not yet formed so this was but the soft shell that looked like the real grain yet to come the original wheat seed of pentecost was to come back in the last age it had been buried at nicaea it sent up a shoot at sardis it grew a tassel at philadelphia and it was to mature at laodicea but it could not be back to the original until the word was restored the prophet had not yet come upon the scene but now according to the time wherein we stand in the laodicean age the prophet messenger of revelation 10 7 must already be in the land once more thus saith the lord must be here ready to be manifested with infallible vindication thus is the true seed already maturing and then the harvest harvest time yes harvest time the two vines that grew together and intertwined their branches are now to be separated the fruits of those vines which were at such variants will be gathered into separate garners the two spirits will go to their separate destinations now it is time to heed the final call that comes only to the wheat bride come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye wheat receive not her tares plagues the great tribulation of the sixth seal and matthew 24 the last warning of the spirit [Music] so [Music] do you
