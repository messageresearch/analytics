few minutes here just relax enjoy the Lord how many I hope you're not in a hurry tonight amen hallelujah you know I just probably maybe two months ago I'd mentioned our vice president of finance his name is Jerry Pete's he's had a backache and thought maybe it was because he had been carrying his grandchild and and and then in August 29th he they did went in and had some very thorough testing and found out he had pancreatic cancer forth States and was already finding not only cancerous pancreas but they found it and his liver and in his lungs and so anyway he started going through the chemo and and then at the end of September I ended up having a stroke and he actually passed away here last Thursday so eight weeks to the day that he found out about it and he was gone and of course you know what I found out you know what the situation was I sent him a little letter because I could got his home email address there's home address and just had a real burden on my heart just to know where he was spiritually and to be able to and talk to him a little bit about salvation don't even know if he ever got the letter ever read the letter or anything never got a response back and I think by the time I got the letter there might have been just before he had a stroke and so we had the memorial day so the memorial service yesterday morning and so I had a chance to go over and and heard a little sermon from his pastor and it was wonderful it was just his pastors got both feet standing on the solid rock and I really appreciated that so I had a chance to talk to his pastor afterwards and I read this on the CaringBridge online you know where the daughter was kind of keeping everybody up to date as things were progressing along and I hadn't really gone through that until actually the evening before them a memorial service saw I was kind of getting caught up on things and so one of the things that was very outstanding is I went over and talked him at the little luncheon after the service and told them you know now that I had said Jerry a letter and I was good insert for a salvation and and so he had said that several people had had felt the same way and actually had talked to Jerry him and he said Jerry's kind of a quiet guy but but Jerry had received Christ as his personal Savior and they said that right towards the end that actually the very day that Jerry passed away pastor they asked him to come over and he was he was in the room and actually Jerry by that time he was in a coma and so when the pastor came in Jerry's wife Dawn just kind of said out loud Jerry says your pastors here to see you now here's a man who had been in a coma all sudden he opened up his eyes he and he said one thing he just smiled he said I made it and he said that was his last words I made it oh I just let that sink in saints of God oh I just love Jesus oh my I made it how did he yeah I was telling some of my staff about that a little I we have usually in afternoons and telling a story about how and how Jerry made it and oh my he's just so good Laura Oh father we're just so grateful to you Lord you made a way Lord Jesus because we couldn't make it ourselves Lord you don't ask us to try so father we just glorify you and praise you in this service tonight Lord amen the pastor and his little sermon at he said so many times we like to we like to help God in his he's already extended his grace but yet somehow we figure we got to help him I don't worry what he said that I said no I like this brother and so I'm like a we ended up actually in swapping stories back and forth about testimonies about different things and about the Lord and so God his business card I told my said brother his name is Craig that says I'd love to get together with you just maybe have lunch break bread together and just talk about the Lord and so he we're gonna try to do that sometimes so you just pray for him amen out of you what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus what

dad would take turns sitting holding her mother's hand and then when one got tired then the other one they'd switch and then the other one got a chance to take a little rest and so one night they were doing this and she had been holding her mother's hands sitting there and and then her dad said well why don't you let me hold her hand for a little while and you take a little rest so a daughter

weekend like we have been announcing birthday reward will be with us from Tennessee and we should have a Saturday night service Sunday morning and Sunday evening service I thought we all thought we were going to do something on the on the tanks giving weekend and but I'm not being able to put myself together and do all the arrangement that I wanted to do so like we normally do that week there will be no service until the weekend so we can have the rest from the sunday from the weekend Aberdare world I actually wanted him to come on the 10th giving weekend but it just couldn't work out so he will be coming the weekend before Thanksgiving is that what we announced sister faith yeah yes that's what been being projected yet if if we've been reading there so we can use that weekend and just have a good Thanksgiving praise and appreciation to the Lord which of course we must be thankful every day amen praise the Lord and this weekend we will also have a healing service as we normally do on the first weekend of the month so first when it comes up this weekend so we will be sunny evening for an evening service praise the Lord amen just like I announced many of us like like a - a brother as is like the role is being caught up yonder brother Sam sent a from gana left was a couple of weeks ago and then named brother deviator he was a he was a good preacher they have good brother a teacher actually and he went to be with the Lord so we we just want to keep your family in pray praise the Lord I want to go back to what we were talking on the last few services we've been talking about trust I want to I want to just go back to there tonight amen and let's let's look at let's look at I was looking at this Hebrew in Hebrew as as I was telling on base so I was just afraid of you if you can help us tonight in their support their their Hebrew definition that the word there sounds like I mean let's look at their together it's a word they're also there means trust any means to support confirmed be faithful to support and to uphold to nourish and as I was looking at the word this came interested interesting to me they also have a meaning of foster father or foster mother or nurse a pillow supporter of the door to be established be faithful to carry make friend to be caring by a nurse not as I was thinking about that I was in my mind I was I was saying most especially when I look at the word foster father foster mother what came to my mind and thinking about trust is you know taking a child or taking a parent at his net yaws directly to be able to trust him and and and then looking at this also to be care about a nurse you know those people in the hospital they are nice people many of them you know our visit to the hospital would be the first time we will ever meet them and to just see how you know when when we are in their situation we trust him with our life praise the Lord Amen the care that he gave to us and you know in all of that so I was just I was just thinking about their that's what i canta for projected this tonight but as we look at you know what we want to go into too that were trust like we we located you know it means to have confidence and that of confiding you know I wish of course I think that is one of the area word our agent I'm is you know is struggling with we are living in in a society where there is a lot of distrust and some of the distrust has come because we have we have wrong people you know I mean we have we have people doing the wrong things you know so it have created a level of distrust praise the Lord Amen and but as as we look at the subject tonight and looking at you know what we've been talking about Trust is it's mostly in a place word we want him to trust the Lord I was also looking at that word and it also means to be hopeful and and when I taught about it I said how many times you know I know there are places where Bob Arum talks about hope and and and sometimes we pick on those things and we kind of for capitalized it as any sense as if hope is a bad word hope is not a bad word praise the Lord amen hope is not about we're actually in in a way I would think about it and say it hope is the strength of faith amen so as I was telling this in and and I saw that the word trust also means to be hopeful and I went back and I started looking at some few things and and I realized that I says well Lord you you just have to help us praise the Lord well we want to look at this tonight and where I want to go with this trust tonight Trust is also a word that could mean to rest amen I want to look I trust tonight in the direction of resting praise the Lord amen let's let's look at this Solomon said and I was also going to like most of you most of us received through the text since the terrorists have a baby girl carrying faith that's her name so we have another faith amen and praise the Lord praise the Lord she's scaring faith a little bit of faith it means she's a little bit of faith amen praise the Lord let's look at Ecclesiastes chapter 11 we were there at the hospital in in you know from since Sunday I've been thinking about Solomon and I've been thinking about this you know having wisdom that we were talking about so I thought about this on my way to the hospital let's look at this together and there's verse clicks as a chapter five and there will be verse 11 no no 11 chapter 11 verse 5 I was looking at something in Chapter five also so Solomon says day she says as doubt knoweth net what is the weight of the spirit praise the Lord remember Jesus said the same thing to Nicodemus you cannot know the weight of the Spirit amen for Jesus he types it with the wane but now Solomon is going to bring it in another way he says as there are nowhere near the way of the spirit known how the bones do grow in the warm of her that is with child even so Dino with net the works of God who maketh all praise the Lord it just makes you to pause and think about it praise the Lord I mean to realize that everything our body this body would need to grow up from a child to the years in the age that the Lord will allot us God supply everything praise the Lord Amen that's a mighty God that's a God that we can trust praise the Lord he says that as we don't know the weight of the Spirit you can apply that to your spiritual life as much as thinking about your natural life everything that a little bit of faith will needs sharing faith who needs to be a girl and be a mother if Jesus story the Lord supplies everything praise the Lord as long as the parents keep her in a good environment and give her the rightful she will grow and all of those things will develop praise the Lord so as we want to look at this word tonight or a look at where we want to go tonight I came across this and then it makes me to start to think about Abraham and that's why we read Genesis chapter 17 remember God there with Abraham in different ways brother Samuel brought it out beautiful the other night our brother from Uganda and it was it was in different ways that God did with him he meant go there with our father Abraham true visions and I mean in in different manifestation and year was one of another manifestation where God appeared to Abraham and and this time like like the scripture says and you know there are balances and God appeared to him as the breast of one praise the Lord God now you have to realize that Abraham God called him and God gave him a promise to be the father of nation and he been trust in the Lord praise the Lord he heard the voice of God he stepped out separated himself from his father house from his kindred from the land and he took him to a lan was seated and maker was God who better and maker was God and I see I see as he got into the journey we know there was different thing that happened he had he is cursing lot there and and and and down the road just like we saw it a little bit on Sunday taking you know those different man of the scripture Abraham you know brought Ishmael but yet that was not the promise that God gave him praise the Lord and he got back again he he kept trust in the Lord for the promise that God gave him in Genesis chapter 15 Abraham got to God and he got down and said Lord God you know you have been so good to me you have blessed me you have I mean you have been showing yourself to me and he and he's going to give God a suggestion now he says this board Ellie is I was born right in my house I had him amen when you asked me law I mean he grew in my house and and he's he's just like a child to me Lord I can take him to be the promised son that you have promised me God said no praise the Lord you have to remember that no is also an arm's answer I mean we don't like no but no it's also an answer God said no the promise will come from you praise the Lord amen and then because of that go how to take Abraham to another experience that was worth he had a sacrifice and and you know and and a deep sleep came upon him and all of those things happen God was to proving to Abraham that I'm going to keep my word and another way to say trust me I mean what I say and I'm going to do it now we travel from Genesis chapter 15 and in onward and after that Abraham grew courage you know and God visited him again in the form of maturity and then you know when and he had a communion with God I mean he stepped into another relationship with the Lord praise the Lord well now right over here in in chapter 17 Abraham is 19 and 9 years old praise the Lord God up here on to him and God is going to bring him into into a a more deeper relationship of trust I mean where trust will get to the level to become rest amen sometimes sometimes we trust and yet we keep looking over our shoulder praise the Lord Amen now you think about it think about it how trust here in the Hebrew takes the word of a foster father or a foster mother you think about it it's a level of relationship and a very beginning of the level of relationship even if the the the the the the child is a baby that child is very innocent so you will realize that the left the the the the place of trust will not be from the child it will now be from the from the mother or the father how would it be there will be a you know himalay they will be thinking in a mire okay yeah us but I wonder when he grew grow up and know that I'm not the father come on he's going to change I wanna she's going to change now because the the child is a little baby a child has not come to consciousness yet so you will realize that morals of the the error of trust will be on the pairing praise the Lord oh and our parent would be I mean they would be selling their trust in every way I mean they take them to the packing and I mean be doing everything that the little baby who Bobby a trust praise the Lord amen we're living in a society just like I said you know a society that has there has no no value for trust I mean the society will teach that little child I soon I did get to talking and we get to understanding the society would teach them that that's your foster father then the role turns around praise the Lord Amen as as soon as their child comes to consciousness that this is your foster father or your foster mother then the road change around then they start interpreting everything that the happines glory be to God amen but abarim taught us cry I mean who is this machee see that we bypass our - you're funny amen so we have to be born again so what happened is that God that predestinated us the new us from the beginning as his son and his daughter God is arrest tracer Lord he's at rest he has already there with his level of trust so he's at rest now we come true the word and assisting we come true our parents we come true the church and all of that and we give our life to God and we are born again now we come to cautiousness amen now so it's we now that's learning to trust God and now we are interpreting everything that happened can we ask for this and it does not happen can i really trust him is God really my father praise the Lord are we together amen so you see that is the reason why he gives us the Holy Ghost to bring our trust to a resting place praise the Lord amen to bring our trust you think about father Abraham right from the beginning I mean that he was he was right there he was sure that he heard a voice I say son you know make me the father of nation he was very sure convinced in his heart but as thing starts happening and he guy comes in the picture and Ishmael comes in the picture and different things start happening he's looking over his shoulder all the time praise the Lord it's not real that he don't he don't trust God when you see trust is just just like I said here and that was the thing that kind of blessed me with this our level of trust it's just not a blind thing it's a relationship it grows as we fellowship amen as we read God's Word as we stand in his presence and he takes us through trials and we come out of faith and realizing that he stayed there we grow in our trust praise the Lord just like how the relationship of a foster parent and a foster child grows and become strong just like how the relationship of a nurse in a patient because that's one of that's one of the the the the definition you a nurse I mean so we care about a nurse you are away from home you are in the hospital you have that gown on you you don't know this nurse from Norway she's now your auntie she's not your sister she don't go to your church want to be nice for us to acts the ones we know to be our nurse I mean gets to the hospital in a register can I have sister Alice to be my nurse wouldn't that wouldn't it be a nice thing praise the Lord but yeah yeah you're right in there than denies that the nurse comes in and says good morning can you tell me your name never meet her from anywhere she asking me for my name your date of birth you got to trust her with all of those information praise the Lord and in but right from there she first tell you her name she calls her name I would be your nurse and she actually what is starting right being relationship relationship starts right there even if she's the meanest woman at that time she try to bring all the smile that is in her praise the Lord because she want you to trust her or maybe it's a man he want you to trust him amen so he's gonna be nice is there anything I can bring for you do you want water are you okay relationship praise the Lord it starts to be huh and that's how Trust is birth I mean trust don't have an ID card I mean a tyke as soon as sure obvious is trust no trust is birth from relationship are we together its birth from relationship and sometimes in strange it's sometimes it takes strange situation praise the Lord it takes in most cases it takes unexpected situation well the nurse comes in and he he tells you his name or her name and asks for your name you give all your information you do everything and and and and and you think about it 3 a.m. in the morning you are sleeping and a nurse comes in the room you don't know him so now you get a sense of that shadow you wake up your eyes why are you looking around because Trust has not built yet Trust is not enough for you to just sleep and snow praise the Lord oh no I'm I'm your nurse' I just I'm just checking on you I'm supposed to take your temperature and everything you know even though you're not happy that your sleep was disturbed but yet you know that the nurse is there for your well-being you can be able to compromise a little bit you don't get angry you know he says why do you woke me up for praise the Lord and you were scared a nurse and you know the relationship would not go well so what it is it's building its building look at this together we were locating the message laying out on to your own understanding brother branham said here just like a baby now this was the reason why I turned to that El Shaddai Scripture just like a baby you take a little baby and let him be born let him be born and let him once lean upon his mother bosom now you have to know a lane is also another definition of trust I mean that's the reason why I mean you sit in on the planing and and someone starts sleeping and start getting close to you you know it's some uncomfortable thing you are checking yourself away but if it's if they relate if his relatives just pull your hair down sleep what are you afraid of you won't do that to stranger praise the Lord praise the Lord you know like I said before when when you start having the services going live he makes you not to be yourself I would have said something but let me continue tonight love the Lord tonight amen just like a little baby let him be born and let him once lean upon his mother bosom nurse from her the warm milk laying on his little head upon her bosom doll he is just a few I was all in a day or two from then take him away from his mother and give him over on the breast of a strange mother he would keep them little feet up in the air and yell it is not his mother see he has he has already had as something about him because he is a part of his mother praise the Lord yet Nature has provided him a way to know his own mama prison law Nature has provided him a way to know his own mama how by living amen pretty soon that track comes in contact with the heartbeat as stunning as the baby age is able to remember their habit from the womb it leans upon his mama a comes in contact with the heartbeat in North exactly put their baby in the hands of a strange mother praise the Lord he leans on heard he realized there was something different with the sound pressure law so as a sustaining as the baby is small it's taking that trust it kicks back cry praise the Lord I mean God took Abraham through different stages of relationship God Elohim himself came down in and in in high communion with Abraham amen but this time it was different praise the Lord this time it was different he comes on the same ninety nine and nine years old you have trust the man you have I mean you I mean true the the sunshine through the snow and through the different trials and and I mean you feel you got a you got up again Abraham and and but but this time just wash that when God told Abraham my brother branham who says come and lean on me amen come and lean on me for strength what happened next after that his name change praise the Lord his name change it was time for the body change it was time for the promised son when trust has farmed his resting place praise the Lord I mean when Trust has come to his resting place where let him go ahead a game didn't lean not on to your own understanding he says and if nature has provided a way for a baby to know his mother from where it is born from how much more has he a son of God that's borne by the Spirit of God amen to know his mama he knows because he was born of the word praise the Lord is it is done that strange there's some times when we go true I mean difficult things what is sickness and disappointment and and in different things the very thing that bring us back into contact with God is his word praise the Lord just pick up the Bible and start reading and I just like the way God would do it in some of the more awkward situation I mean disappointed in and feeling so bad like rejected by everyone you pick up the Bible and go we'll just make a verse come to light I mean in the worst bachelor distinct God will make a word come to light that's truth then pretty soon you start feeling a shame of yourself then you start repenting praise the Lord Amen in many times he Mele it looks like and and sometimes we say like that but it's wrong it looks like well you got to go and start from zero to gain know if you realize your trust just pick up from just where you stopped and you move on praise the Lord it's not Nicodemo teaching where you got to go back to the womb and be born again and sometimes people says well you got to start all over again you got no praise the Lord well actually happiness dead you have I mean you have got right in in a way you have got in God's Way and now you have to back up when you surrounded and he comes and continue from where he stopped and take you on he knows because he was born of the word and he understand the word put him in a strange place he's certainly out of place he would get out as quick as he is a strange place is now only a denomination Church strange places in Our Lives strange places in things that we do things that we allow because it is not of the word you remember like we read on on Sunday Jesus toes right there in us in John chapter eight he says there is no place you know sitting don't have no place and like I've always said that's the reason why God trusts us because he gave each of his sons and his daughter a portion of himself amen and it's that little C word brother Branham says just like a bottom it's that little C word well you see you didn't you didn't pay for it you didn't put it there you can take it from there amen it was now your choice it was God's choice are we together and that and that little thing in this in this falling body starts to grow in relationship praise the Lord in relationship God brought Abraham right down there and said I'm the Almighty God walk before me and be perfect amen walk before me and be strengthened and big strong but Brenham on unconditional covenant he says I'm El Shaddai the Almighty God now yet you are old your strenght is all gone CIRA womb is dead you she's ninety little grandma like now a great ingredient grid grandma a ninety years old she's all for all the people laughing at you and making fun of you but I'm the breast at one like I'm like a mother to her sickly Fred baby now when the little baby all week and run down his train is gone praise the Lord physically think about it when even mental strain is gone you can make sense of faith sometimes God will bring us to that place I mean you think about some of our other lessons that is just up there in the age and sometimes when we come to we get to that place of just about crossing the river there is nothing to hold on to praise the Lord there is no physical strength sometimes there is no mental strength but it's that relationship that has been built all of those years they can close their eyes and trust that right across the river the father will be there to work on their home amen it's not a guesswork it's not a guesswork it just like when you when you when you travel in and you know what I mean you coming back homey you know based on a relationship you expect to meet your loved ones to pick you up so is that is that level of trust were weekend we can rest assure praise the Lord amen and in the hour that that that we are earning in all the things that is happening around us I mean the Word of God has been brought to question the message has been brought to question preachers have been brought to questions praise the Lord our fundamental beliefs and doctrines has been brought to questions in every way well you see this this this whole thing it was not about doctrine no those are just don't suggest principles from the Word of God that he has given to us and like brother Branham who says it was all of it they were just all to give us an idea of this great one and he's the one that we have to trust praise the Lord amen hey Ava you know the repetition of your favorite preacher gets on the line trust God of the one that you love your loved one we have to trust God praise the Lord we have to trust him because God trusts us amen he put us in this age because he trusts us like Burt Branham says in God of this evil age he says this bride is not going to be like Eve Amen now you have to realize that God wanted to manifest his attribute that is the reason why he brought Eve out in a design that she was brought out and now he has manifested his attribute through all the ages praise the Lord it's time to go back home amen so this Eve he has fortified her with the word he revealed the seals that the loose ends I mean in everything and he even put us in in in a dating image that Daniel saw where knowledge is increased we have technology we have everything a normal looks like it's not enough and he's even exposing us to pressing or trials and everything just to be able to build us because this bride will not feel I mean this bride will not feel your trials are not failures to God your trials is just to make put you to the place that you will not fail he says wash I'm the breast of one just draw night onto me draw night what is that James talks about that draw night on to God and he would draw that on to you draw nigh what is there what is that what makes you to draw nine is it steps of building relationship draw night on to me and I will draw nigh God sometimes how to use our language it's not like come closer and I will come closer the more you come closer the rear I will become to you amen sometimes you have to use our language it's now like push close to mean and then I would take one step to you the more you come closer the more you get to know who I am the rear I will become to you draw matter to me now I want to give you some consolation right quick if I can in this and show you now how God he didn't do no good as long as Lord hang around that's right he had to get rid of he called him to a separate alright I actually put this for this cup there because I had a personal not honor it and what I wanted to deal with was to draw nigh amen was the draw nigh a level of trust I mean a level of trust you come from work you're tired had a busy day and yet have your mind prepared you just join me in your car and drive to church what is that you are trusting that God will do something special you are trusting that he will speak to you I mean and sometimes we pub the service all the activities that happen in church and forget about the person that we came to meet amen now you think about that you think about that God promised in his word and said draw nigh onto me I would draw nigh on to you and do you think that you you you put the time into coming to seek God and you know people says well I really disappointed in the service today why because you you you put your mind on what was happening you put your mind on the preacher you put your mind on the musicians praise the Lord but if you just keep your mind on him amen trying to vary time you jump into your vehicle and you hit the road and you and you realize that every step every meaning on the road you are drawing nigh to God amen you keep him on your mind and you you know you are you are thinking about him and and and I mean just a fellowship you going to have with he and his children I mean in his presence praise the Lord trusting the law musicians you can come for tonight but just think about it I mean to realize that on this side god he sat rest amen just a thing about it he's at rest you have to think about it like Paul says over in English emphasis is we that were one-time strangers we were wondering aliens it is net it is net our sole alien is this body that was killing amen is this body that was alien we're almost like first two children now becoming a son a new birth brings us in today we are no longer strangers we can trust God we can say like our Lord I came from God I would go back to God praise the Lord and even when you say that you gotta trust the law because the devil will prove you on every ground whether you really mean what you say or whether you really know what you're saying praise the Lord [Music] even if there is nothing to hold on to can we trust the Lord I mean even if the dose of the of the church is close can we trust the Lord check for example you came to service and and then you never knew that the service was cancer and you drove through the snow
