[48:51] amen let's read from verse 12 matthew
[48:54] chapter 7
[48:55] let's read from verse 12 to 9.
[49:02] what is called the golden rule even the
[49:05] judges
[49:06] will say this is the golden rule
[49:11] therefore all things whatsoever
[49:14] yeah who that man should do to you
[49:18] do you even sow to them
[49:21] for this is the lord and the prophets
[49:24] praise the lord
[49:28] enter year in at the straight gate
[49:31] for wide is the gate and broad is the
[49:34] way
[49:34] that leader to destruction and many
[49:38] there be which go in there
[49:42] because straight is to give and narrow
[49:44] is the way
[49:45] we should lead it onto life and feel
[49:49] there being that finding beware
[49:53] of false prophets which
[49:56] come to you in sheep's clothing
[50:00] but in walling they are reading walls
[50:04] yes i know them by their fruits
[50:08] do men gather graves of tongues
[50:12] and faith of tassels
[50:16] even so every good tree bringeth for
[50:19] good fruit
[50:21] but a corrupt tree bringeth for evil
[50:24] fruit
[50:26] a good tree cannot bring forth
[50:29] evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree
[50:31] bring food good fruit
[50:34] every tree that brings net
[50:37] food good fruit is held then and cast
[50:40] into the fire
[50:42] wherefore by their fruits yes i know
[50:45] them
[50:47] not everyone that served unto me lord
[50:50] lord
[50:51] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[50:54] but he that does the will of my father
[50:57] which is in heaven
[50:59] many will say to me in that day lord
[51:02] lord have we not
[51:04] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[51:07] have cast out devils and in thy name
[51:10] done many
[51:11] wonderful works
[51:14] and then will i profess unto them i
[51:17] never knew
[51:18] you depart from me yeah that work
[51:22] iniquity therefore
[51:25] whosoever year at this scene of mine
[51:28] and dustin will are liking him onto a
[51:32] wise man

[51:45] these three things
[51:46] they are storm elements
[51:50] the rain descended the floor came and
[51:53] the wind
[51:53] blew and beat upon that house
[51:57] and it fell now for it was founded upon
[51:59] the rock
[52:01] and everyone that year it is saying of
[52:04] mine
[52:05] and does them that shall be lacking unto
[52:08] a foolish man
[52:09] which built his house upon the sin
[52:12] and the rain descended the floor came
[52:15] and the wind blew
[52:16] and beat upon that house and he fell
[52:19] and greed was the fall of a yes

[52:26] this sin
[52:28] the disciples the people sorry were

[55:21] thing we would read by the way of course
[55:22] tonight
[55:24] and uh
[55:25] [Music]
[55:29] some time ago i was
[55:33] i was sure believing when brother
[55:35] branham was preaching
[55:36] the message perfect faith he said
[55:39] something like this
[55:41] and uh i was looking for this court
[55:46] and then while i was preparing to preach
[55:48] for the
[55:49] the teddy first night i was listening to
[55:51] the message be not afraid and
[55:53] it pops out in my face
[55:59] so i said well i gotta take it and put
[56:01] it into a treasure box amen
[56:04] praise the lord but ben says
[56:07] and i'm grateful to god that the hour
[56:10] is sown at hand i believe it is
[56:14] when god is going to help his children
[56:18] [Music]
[56:19] do you need their help do you
[56:22] really need their help
[56:24] [Music]
[56:26] praise the lord i don't know if i if i
[56:28] did ask the question if you would have
[56:30] raised your hand
[56:31] if i didn't ask the question but every
[56:34] time i read that
[56:35] i know that help is on the way amen
[56:38] praise the lord
[56:40] the hour is here where god is going to
[56:43] help his children
[56:44] and when you look around the world and
[56:46] you see the different things that are
[56:47] happening
[56:48] and you hear the stories of different
[56:51] ones you really know that god is helping
[56:53] his children
[56:54] amen but let's go along a little bit he
[56:57] said god is going to help his children
[56:58] especially it would be for those
[57:03] who can muster the faith
[57:07] that word muster is used in the military
[57:13] is uh is is used in a time of
[57:16] preparation
[57:17] get yourself together get your ass
[57:19] together
[57:20] you know get everything together
[57:24] you know so brother branham is saying
[57:27] it's for those that
[57:32] believe god they believe the message
[57:36] they believe that god sent a prophet
[57:40] but in some way i mean there is just
[57:43] still an
[57:44] area there they are trusting god for
[57:48] amen amen
[57:51] now when he was saying this it was at
[57:54] the birth
[57:55] of the temple
[57:58] he was actually referring to the reason
[58:00] why
[58:01] that ministry was coming
[58:06] praise the lord now when when we think
[58:09] about the tear pool
[58:11] and and the the the creation of scars
[58:14] giving little fish life back you know
[58:17] all of those things is is it's great
[58:20] faith is the fate of the son of man
[58:24] amen but yet
[58:27] it's associated brother listen now it's
[58:31] associated brother branham says
[58:33] there are people that have been on on
[58:35] the waiting list
[58:40] but yet god could show his mercy
[58:43] to a little fish
[58:46] great faith
[58:50] yes but to little situations
[58:55] praise the lord he says god is going to
[58:59] help his children
[59:02] god is going to help his children i
[59:06] i want there to just keep ringing in my
[59:08] brain
[59:10] god is going to help his children
[59:13] especially
[59:17] those who can master the faith to rise
[59:21] up and get ahold of god
[59:25] like they like yes
[59:29] to rise up and get a hold of god
[59:33] there is faith in their heart that they
[59:36] believe that god is real
[59:39] there is faith in their heart that they
[59:40] believe that the message of the
[59:43] hour is the voice of god to us in this
[59:46] day
[59:47] for the faith to rise yes and just
[59:50] get ahold of it and just step into it
[59:57] hallelujah he said but the hour
[1:00:00] has come where god
[1:00:03] not the pastor going to help you
[1:00:09] where god is going to help
[1:00:13] his children amen
[1:00:17] amen i believe the lord
[1:00:21] is providing a way for us now
[1:00:24] to take care of them also the weak ones
[1:00:28] you have to remember
[1:00:32] when moses went to pharaoh and asked
[1:00:38] let the people go paris yeah you can go
[1:00:41] and worship
[1:00:42] go on the mountain and worship and
[1:00:44] everything
[1:00:49] the reason why moses really did not take
[1:00:52] that offer
[1:00:53] if it was just for the energetic people
[1:00:56] and the strong man they could go to the
[1:00:58] mountain and disappear
[1:01:01] but moses knew there were little ones
[1:01:05] he knew they were older ones
[1:01:08] there were feeble ones praise the lord
[1:01:12] if we go to the mountain and think we
[1:01:14] should run away these people once will
[1:01:16] not be able to go
[1:01:19] so he went back to pharaoh
[1:01:24] the lord demanding that all the people
[1:01:28] that we will now leave one feeble one
[1:01:33] behind and god is making a provision
[1:01:39] brother branham says god is now
[1:01:40] providing for those ones
[1:01:44] the territory is now for the smart ones
[1:01:47] the there poor are for the weak ones
[1:01:52] if you remember that god can care for a
[1:01:56] little fish
[1:01:58] you remember that god can care for you
[1:02:03] praise the lord
[1:02:10] amen amen
[1:02:13] so god has already made a provision
[1:02:16] there is no need of you using
[1:02:18] your weaknesses for an excuse you don't
[1:02:22] have no excuse because god has already
[1:02:24] made a provision
[1:02:28] your excuse will not hold water
[1:02:34] it will not hold water because god has
[1:02:37] already
[1:02:38] made a provision no matter what you are
[1:02:41] dealing with
[1:02:42] what you are struggling with there is a
[1:02:46] provision
[1:02:49] god has already made a provision that's
[1:02:52] the reason why
[1:02:54] we are not leaving one single one behind
[1:02:57] amen praise the lord
[1:03:00] amen and we will not just
[1:03:04] barely admit it we will overcome
[1:03:08] this bride will not barely make it we're
[1:03:10] not getting over
[1:03:12] by the skin of our teeth we are getting
[1:03:15] over as
[1:03:16] overcomers because god
[1:03:19] has already made provision amen
[1:03:27] praise the lord this supposed to be a
[1:03:31] prayer meeting
[1:03:32] amen but i've learned over the years
[1:03:38] there is there's differences when you
[1:03:39] pray
[1:03:41] privately by yourself and you pray as a
[1:03:43] congregation
[1:03:44] when you pray as a congregation you
[1:03:46] don't leave the people behind
[1:03:48] you get the feelings of the people
[1:03:53] and when you stand to feel the energy
[1:03:55] leaving
[1:03:57] then it's time for you to break the
[1:03:59] people out
[1:04:01] you might not understand that but i know
[1:04:02] what i'm talking about
[1:04:05] praise the lord
[1:04:10] thank you
[1:04:16] your individual prayer life is different
[1:04:18] from a congregation of prayer life
[1:04:21] or the congregation of prayer time amen
[1:04:29] tonight i want to i want to do something
[1:04:31] i'm going to approach this
[1:04:33] little subject tonight i hope i can be
[1:04:34] able to do in a small time that is left
[1:04:36] for me
[1:04:37] tonight a pickup from uh from what uh a
[1:04:40] little bit of what brother daniel was
[1:04:41] preaching
[1:04:42] to us on sunday you enjoyed the message
[1:04:44] on sunday was that a beautiful message
[1:04:46] amen
[1:04:47] amen yeah i mean that was just a
[1:04:49] beautiful teaching
[1:04:50] praise the lord i mean it just shaped
[1:04:52] your mind your attitude line everything
[1:04:54] with the word
[1:04:56] praise the lord amen it gives you
[1:04:59] it gives you a good good mental attitude
[1:05:03] when somebody is struggling amen
[1:05:07] there is no uh
[1:05:11] big art and small you you know
[1:05:14] super believer muscles believer and
[1:05:18] skinny believer no we are all sons and
[1:05:20] daughters of god
[1:05:22] praise the lord so just so just like we
[1:05:26] had
[1:05:26] we have the three kinds of believers in
[1:05:28] this body we also have the the the
[1:05:31] you know the ten the the both wise and
[1:05:33] foolish in this body
[1:05:34] a little bit of that we're going to talk
[1:05:36] about tonight but what is drawing me to
[1:05:38] this subject is just a child mind
[1:05:41] amen it's just a child mind
[1:05:44] and one of the little kids asks me and
[1:05:47] says
[1:05:48] uh but brother daniel said he was
[1:05:50] preaching on what house would you bail
[1:05:52] me
[1:05:54] but he didn't talk about house he just
[1:05:57] talked about virgins
[1:06:01] praise the lord
[1:06:05] and that's where my inspiration is
[1:06:06] coming from tonight
[1:06:08] so i had to help the child to see how
[1:06:13] the divergence is compared to house
[1:06:16] and for me to help them to see it as is
[1:06:19] you remember the story of what jesus
[1:06:20] talked about
[1:06:21] a wise man built his house so
[1:06:25] wise virgin house
[1:06:29] and the foolish man built his house on
[1:06:31] the sand
[1:06:33] she says oh yeah so you see the house he
[1:06:35] was talking about
[1:06:37] is is is being wise and and and
[1:06:40] the way he was able to to you know to
[1:06:42] prepare
[1:06:43] and and i'm not preaching to a kid
[1:06:45] tonight i'm just going to tell you that
[1:06:47] i don't have the inspiration to explain
[1:06:49] it to you like i did to a kid
[1:06:52] praise the lord
[1:06:56] but it just it just then opened another
[1:06:59] page for me
[1:07:01] so we're going to look at that tonight
[1:07:03] remember that uh
[1:07:05] uh you know jesus taught on the parables
[1:07:10] so so even with the wise man
[1:07:14] building his house on the rock and and
[1:07:16] the foolish man building his house on
[1:07:18] the sand
[1:07:18] it was another parable but you have to
[1:07:20] realize that this
[1:07:22] this is the beginning of his ministry so
[1:07:25] who is he dealing with here he's dealing
[1:07:27] with the leaders
[1:07:30] at the end of his ministry the same
[1:07:33] thing he taught
[1:07:34] as a tenth virgin is the same thing he
[1:07:37] taught
[1:07:37] earlier as 10 men that built their house
[1:07:43] now he's using men that build the house
[1:07:45] here because
[1:07:46] he's talking to the leaders
[1:07:50] praise the lord the scripture help us to
[1:07:52] see that right here the bible says
[1:07:55] year praise the lord
[1:07:58] and the bible says
[1:08:07] verse the last verse for he taught them
[1:08:11] as
[1:08:11] one having authority and not as
[1:08:14] a strike the stripes were the teachers
[1:08:17] of the lord
[1:08:18] amen and and and jesus as he taught this
[1:08:22] parable
[1:08:23] bringing them to this place he started
[1:08:25] in verse 15 he says
[1:08:27] beware of false prophets prophets
[1:08:30] means preachers teachers amen
[1:08:34] he says yeah uh they are they are
[1:08:37] dressed in
[1:08:38] in sheep clothing but they are wolves he
[1:08:41] gets down
[1:08:43] and and then he starts to talk about uh
[1:08:46] uh even when he gets down here he sees
[1:08:49] and many will say unto me
[1:08:51] lord lord have i not prophesied
[1:08:54] what is there proclaiming
[1:08:58] amen have i not prophesied proclaiming i
[1:09:01] found that cast out devil
[1:09:02] so so you see here at the early part of
[1:09:06] his ministry
[1:09:07] he starts to de-wave the leaders
[1:09:11] he starts to de-wave the teachers
[1:09:14] praise the lord now brother branham used
[1:09:16] this very scripture to preach the
[1:09:18] message on
[1:09:19] their their uncommon stomach and and
[1:09:22] uh uh but we will not really talk about
[1:09:25] it on coming some tonight
[1:09:27] but we will look at it in in
[1:09:30] in the same way pretty much the same way
[1:09:33] that uh you know our brother preached to
[1:09:36] us
[1:09:37] now so we we so that that was the thing
[1:09:39] that caught my mind while i was i was uh
[1:09:42] explaining that to the little child it
[1:09:45] caught my mind
[1:09:46] now back in the book of proverbs
[1:09:50] the holy spirit did in chapter 9 uh
[1:09:53] solomon talked about wisdom
[1:09:56] building her house on seven pillows
[1:10:00] amen and in the very same chapter 9
[1:10:04] solomon brings out wisdom and he also
[1:10:07] talks about the foolish woman
[1:10:10] so you see this whole subject about wise
[1:10:12] virgin and foolish virgin
[1:10:14] was was right from the beginning
[1:10:19] are we together amen was right from the
[1:10:23] beginning
[1:10:23] but now jesus at the end of his ministry
[1:10:28] he's talking about the product you
[1:10:30] remember
[1:10:31] in in the in the in the the
[1:10:34] the the preview of the bride
[1:10:37] amen now what made brother branham cry
[1:10:41] i'll stay in line
[1:10:43] is because when he started seeing the
[1:10:46] other
[1:10:47] churchgoer in the wallet church what did
[1:10:49] he say
[1:10:50] is this what we have produced
[1:10:54] amen he said all of this why we've been
[1:10:57] preaching
[1:10:58] with all of the revivals that have got
[1:11:00] is it what we have produced
[1:11:02] now so yeah jesus at the end of the
[1:11:05] ministry
[1:11:06] he's he's telling these leaders
[1:11:09] that he spoke to a year you will see
[1:11:12] that a little bit
[1:11:13] what the product that would come out of
[1:11:15] them
[1:11:17] if a wise man built his house on the
[1:11:19] rock
[1:11:21] he would definitely get a wise virgin a
[1:11:23] wise church
[1:11:26] if a foolish man build his house on the
[1:11:29] sand
[1:11:29] he's definitely going to get a foolish
[1:11:32] product
[1:11:35] praise the lord so you see it has to
[1:11:38] first start
[1:11:39] with the leaders
[1:11:44] praise the lord you cannot condemn the
[1:11:46] people
[1:11:47] and lead the leaders
[1:11:51] you have to look at the leaders
[1:11:54] the leaders are responsible for the
[1:11:57] actions
[1:11:58] and the attitude of the people
[1:12:02] are we together
[1:12:08] so solomon spoke a little bit about that
[1:12:11] we don't have a lot of time tonight
[1:12:13] but uh uh
[1:12:17] uh we will just travel a little bit here
[1:12:20] so you can see
[1:12:22] see something here just like i said
[1:12:24] jesus in his bible
[1:12:26] he talks about the rain descent the
[1:12:28] floor came the wind blew
[1:12:30] like i said these are all storm elements
[1:12:33] okay and then yeah on the uncommon stone
[1:12:36] brother brandon there was tommy elements
[1:12:39] and that's and he was preaching from
[1:12:41] this message but yeah
[1:12:42] we see here so you take this now take
[1:12:46] this as
[1:12:46] a foundation the wise man built
[1:12:50] his house jesus is talking in parables
[1:12:54] amen that if you are wise
[1:12:58] if you have wisdom your foundation
[1:13:02] will be solid your foundation will not
[1:13:06] just be church
[1:13:07] journey you will not be coming because
[1:13:10] your parents are coming
[1:13:12] amen you your foundation
[1:13:16] will be on the unmovable rock of god's
[1:13:20] word
[1:13:22] amen you have to go back
[1:13:25] in your heart he says
[1:13:29] why did i believe
[1:13:32] why did i believe why am i coming to
[1:13:35] church
[1:13:38] why am i coming to church
[1:13:43] what does all of this means to me
[1:13:50] if everybody leave can i stand alone
[1:13:58] you have to go back to
[1:14:01] your foundation
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:10] you have to go back to your foundation
[1:14:15] amen the wise man
[1:14:18] build his house upon the rock
[1:14:23] yes hallelujah you have to be
[1:14:27] talking to yourself
[1:14:32] instead of being nausea about other
[1:14:34] people you have to be talking to
[1:14:36] yourself
[1:14:38] preaching to yourself yes right
[1:14:42] what does all of this means to me
[1:14:47] why why do i spend my time you know
[1:14:49] coming to church wednesday night
[1:14:51] coming to church sunday what does all of
[1:14:53] this means to me
[1:14:56] have you really put sense to what you
[1:14:59] are doing
[1:15:01] oh we are just doing it because other
[1:15:03] people are doing it
[1:15:05] and they are encouraging us to do the
[1:15:08] same
[1:15:10] praise the lord
[1:15:26] that thing's coming to my mind i don't
[1:15:27] want to go there let's just stay right
[1:15:30] here
[1:15:30] the lord will help us amen the lord can
[1:15:32] help us in few words
[1:15:34] than just going all over the place
[1:15:41] there was some things coming to my mind
[1:15:42] but let me just stay with a few words
[1:15:45] praise the lord let's let's just let's
[1:15:47] do something tonight again
[1:15:48] first corinthians 3.
[1:15:54] remember now this was supposed to be a
[1:15:55] prayer meeting okay
[1:16:00] this was supposed to be a prayer meeting
[1:16:11] amen you love the lord
[1:16:17] i believe the end you i believe there
[1:16:20] praise the lord
[1:16:22] amen first corinthians chapter three
[1:16:25] here paul is also talking about building
[1:16:27] and foundation in world of view so let's
[1:16:29] just look at that
[1:16:31] let's come to the apostle paul here he
[1:16:33] might help us
[1:16:34] amen
[1:16:39] paul says here over in verse 9
[1:16:43] he says for we are liberals together
[1:16:46] with god
[1:16:48] ye are god's husbandry
[1:16:52] ye are god's building amen
[1:16:57] according to the grace of god which is
[1:17:00] given unto me as a wise master builder
[1:17:06] i have laid the foundation
[1:17:11] and other builders their
[1:17:15] but let every man take he
[1:17:19] how he buildeth their
[1:17:22] own praise the lord amen
[1:17:26] amen let every man
[1:17:29] take he motives and
[1:17:32] objectives look at your motives
[1:17:38] and your objectives praise the lord
[1:17:42] amen you know brown talks about you know
[1:17:46] the the pharisees how they were just
[1:17:48] actors
[1:17:51] you know and and and and much of that
[1:17:54] sometimes
[1:17:54] happened with people around church
[1:18:00] as now you pack your car in the parking
[1:18:02] lot
[1:18:03] you look in your rearview mirror
[1:18:05] straighten your necktie
[1:18:08] you step out of the car god bless you
[1:18:13] god bless you you know i mean they're
[1:18:16] just
[1:18:16] reeling you know and praise the lord
[1:18:20] and it's just all acting
[1:18:24] it's just all right it's just for that
[1:18:26] moment
[1:18:29] it's just for that moment there is there
[1:18:31] is no burden
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:40] there is no sincerity it's just for that
[1:18:44] moment
[1:18:44] it's just a show to people it's just a
[1:18:52] show
[1:18:55] praise the lord to some people it has
[1:18:57] become a culture
[1:19:00] some people they have become their
[1:19:02] family tradition their dad was doing it
[1:19:04] that way so they have to do it that way
[1:19:06] you know that that's the way we know how
[1:19:07] to do it that's the way we know how to
[1:19:08] serve god
[1:19:09] that's the way we believe the message no
[1:19:11] two persons believe the message the same
[1:19:13] way
[1:19:15] because god meet us at different times
[1:19:18] different experiences
[1:19:24] don't come don't don't you you can't you
[1:19:26] you can you can
[1:19:27] drill a person down in your conviction
[1:19:32] you can pray for god to deal with them
[1:19:39] because if they are not taking rightful
[1:19:41] and left with you they know
[1:19:42] they are not a believer yet they're not
[1:19:45] convert they are not converted yet
[1:19:55] let every man let every man take he
[1:20:00] how he built their own
[1:20:04] for all the foundation can no man lay
[1:20:08] that is lame and what is that foundation
[1:20:12] jesus christ a personal revelation of
[1:20:15] jesus christ
[1:20:17] paul's saying i'm the master builder i
[1:20:19] was i never met jesus in the flesh
[1:20:23] amen but
[1:20:26] as a chief apostle he met
[1:20:29] me the very way he met peter
[1:20:33] when peter said thou are christ son of
[1:20:37] the living god it was by revelation
[1:20:39] when god blinded paul on the road of
[1:20:41] damascus
[1:20:42] it was by revelation now paul
[1:20:46] said who are thou lord
[1:20:51] hallelujah yes
[1:20:54] no other foundation can be laid
[1:20:57] it's not it cannot be handed down
[1:21:03] you can't hand it down to your children
[1:21:05] and grandchildren no
[1:21:06] it must come by the birth it must come
[1:21:08] about an experience
[1:21:20] now listen here now he says if any man
[1:21:23] build upon this foundation
[1:21:26] go silver pressure stones
[1:21:32] wood hell and
[1:21:36] stubbles now he's taking three
[1:21:41] these are six elements
[1:21:44] six elements six is the number of men
[1:21:49] but three of them are god-given
[1:21:54] and three i marry me
[1:21:59] is god i give gold is god i give siva
[1:22:03] is god that gave precious stones
[1:22:08] praise the lord
[1:22:11] wood is a man that cut the tree down
[1:22:15] to make wood god gave him tree
[1:22:19] he cut it down to make wood
[1:22:25] are we together so there are three
[1:22:29] god-given elements and there are three
[1:22:33] mammy elements so paul is saying
[1:22:37] if any man is building that's how you
[1:22:40] have to go
[1:22:41] back and look at your motives and
[1:22:44] objectives
[1:22:47] praise the lord and see this thing is
[1:22:50] god that is dealing with me
[1:22:52] i'm not just following
[1:23:00] praise the lord because if a man is
[1:23:02] doing what he's doing
[1:23:04] because god is leading him and god is
[1:23:07] dealing with him
[1:23:08] it's a precious storm it could be gold
[1:23:11] it could be silver it could be warm
[1:23:13] pressure stones all the precious stones
[1:23:15] are not the same
[1:23:24] but a man can be on the other side yeah
[1:23:26] i mean uh
[1:23:27] building a big caterer so so i so i can
[1:23:30] have the biggest church in minneapolis a
[1:23:32] man can be on the other side
[1:23:34] you know trying to you know impress
[1:23:37] people
[1:23:37] may i i mean i i i got my commission and
[1:23:40] an angel met me
[1:23:41] and an injured and you can do all of
[1:23:44] those things
[1:23:48] and he's just carving wood
[1:23:53] all he's doing
[1:23:57] oh it's a hill that he's putting
[1:24:00] together
[1:24:02] the lord
[1:24:06] now think about it now wise man
[1:24:12] built his house and a foolish man
[1:24:15] built his house so paul now by
[1:24:18] revelation
[1:24:19] he's taking what jesus preached
[1:24:24] and he's bringing it in depth
[1:24:28] that in building house
[1:24:32] praise the lord amen
[1:24:37] are we together
[1:24:49] paul says every man work
[1:24:54] shall be made manifest
[1:24:58] for the day shall declare it
[1:25:02] for the day shall declare it every man
[1:25:05] work
[1:25:06] will be made manifest
[1:25:10] that's one thing when god left
[1:25:13] eternity and broke into time
[1:25:16] you have to realize he came into time
[1:25:20] with as as the spirit of truth the
[1:25:22] internal spirit
[1:25:23] of truth so there is one thing about
[1:25:26] time
[1:25:26] it always tells the truth just give time
[1:25:34] you will know the man for who he is
[1:25:38] or you know a person for who they claim
[1:25:41] to be
[1:25:42] every man work shall be made manifest
[1:25:45] for the day shall declare it because it
[1:25:48] shall be
[1:25:49] revealed by fire if you put fire to gold
[1:25:53] it shines
[1:25:57] you put fire to savor it with stain
[1:26:00] fire to precious to whatever precious
[1:26:03] tone it is
[1:26:07] it's going to come out better you put
[1:26:10] fire to
[1:26:11] it will burn and burn the whole house
[1:26:14] down
[1:26:17] amen the same thing you put fire to a
[1:26:20] bunch of hell he's going to do the same
[1:26:21] thing
[1:26:25] how we together but watch here now
[1:26:28] if you bring this subject into the
[1:26:31] context
[1:26:34] of what jesus
[1:26:37] preached or taught on the 10th virgin
[1:26:41] that brother daniel talked about then
[1:26:43] you will understand why paul made this
[1:26:45] statement
[1:26:46] he says every man and he says
[1:26:50] if any man works abide which
[1:26:54] he have built that upon
[1:26:57] he shall receive a reward
[1:27:01] if any man work shall be burned
[1:27:05] he shall suffer lust but
[1:27:08] he himself shall be saved
[1:27:14] yet so by fire
[1:27:19] praise the lord amen you see that's that
[1:27:23] that is the reason why
[1:27:25] uh uh uh uh the foolish virgin would not
[1:27:27] go in the rapture
[1:27:29] but she would be saved by her testimony
[1:27:33] she will have to stand for the word
[1:27:36] praise the lord
[1:27:37] i mean she will realize she will start
[1:27:39] seeing things happening
[1:27:41] i say oh my god i mean all of these
[1:27:43] things if these things are happening
[1:27:45] you know it means that the rapture has
[1:27:47] gone but she will be able to stand
[1:27:50] now if we cannot stand
[1:27:53] when there is no pressure
[1:27:56] when we cannot stand
[1:28:01] praise the lord when we cannot stand
[1:28:05] when there is nobody around you giving
[1:28:07] you pressure
[1:28:09] praise the lord
[1:28:17] you think about that
[1:28:22] i mean little things we we we compromise
[1:28:24] and give into little spirits and little
[1:28:27] doubts and little
[1:28:28] gossip and little argument and i mean i
[1:28:31] mean
[1:28:31] it's just it's just hard for people to
[1:28:33] take a stand
[1:28:37] i mean sometimes it just looked like all
[1:28:38] of these all of these people running
[1:28:40] into the street to to riot
[1:28:42] you know sometimes you ask them what is
[1:28:44] it they can't even explain to you
[1:28:45] they're just going because there's a
[1:28:47] crowd that is growing
[1:28:50] no conviction no purpose
[1:28:54] they've just been caught under the wrong
[1:28:56] spirit
[1:29:03] and the believer must not be like that
[1:29:07] amen if if a situation comes up
[1:29:11] i mean people should be able to relax
[1:29:14] and know that god is in control
[1:29:17] relax and don't take the situation in
[1:29:19] your hands
[1:29:21] relax and know that god is in control
[1:29:23] and then you ask yourself
[1:29:25] now how can i apply myself to this
[1:29:28] situation
[1:29:29] what is my place but soon a little
[1:29:32] situation come
[1:29:33] the other person you hear what happened
[1:29:36] oh i know about it and then it just
[1:29:38] started going like that
[1:29:39] why fire
[1:30:01] he says knowing that that ye are the
[1:30:04] temple of god
[1:30:06] and that the spirit of god dwelleth
[1:30:10] in you amen
[1:30:14] you are the temple of god you are the
[1:30:16] house
[1:30:17] that is being built
[1:30:20] but the materials that i use
[1:30:25] is what will make the house to stand
[1:30:29] amen the material that i use
[1:30:38] this message has been used to build all
[1:30:40] sorts of houses
[1:30:44] all sorts of houses people have used
[1:30:46] this gospel to build
[1:30:51] some has used it to build their
[1:30:52] retirement relaxed home
[1:30:56] on the lake
[1:31:03] some has used it to to build a kingdom
[1:31:06] where the people carry them on their
[1:31:08] back and shoulders
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:15] is the material that is used
[1:31:19] that's why we make that house to stand
[1:31:25] that's why you have to go back
[1:31:29] go back to your heart and say lord where
[1:31:33] am i with you
[1:31:34] [Music]

[1:31:43] where am i with you
[1:31:47] praise the lord lord this this is not
[1:31:50] follow follow
[1:31:54] it's me and jesus
[1:32:04] so you see here
[1:32:08] i'm just i'm just trying to answer that
[1:32:10] little chai question
[1:32:12] we see right here
[1:32:16] how jesus
[1:32:20] trying to deal with those leaders
[1:32:26] trying to deal with the leaders because
[1:32:29] what they were holding
[1:32:31] to the the law
[1:32:35] these were the very people that would
[1:32:37] condemn republican
[1:32:41] and they can knock their chests and both
[1:32:43] of it we are children of abraham
[1:32:49] all because they have the right
[1:32:50] measurement in their skirts
[1:32:55] amen and they are born of a certain
[1:32:59] tribe
[1:33:01] they were circumcised on the eighth day
[1:33:06] so all of that was what they talked
[1:33:12] as righteousness
[1:33:17] all of that was what they talked jesus
[1:33:20] speaking to them in parable
[1:33:22] and says tell me then who is your
[1:33:23] neighbor
[1:33:26] he says three men went traveling down
[1:33:28] the stripe the pharisees
[1:33:31] and the samaritan they went and saw the
[1:33:34] beggar down the street
[1:33:36] the stripe comes says he's sin that's
[1:33:39] why he's suffering like that
[1:33:40] that he seemed made him to suffer and he
[1:33:43] went his way
[1:33:48] the pharisees came his own garment was
[1:33:50] so clean he just can't touch that man
[1:33:54] but a stranger a samaritan came
[1:33:58] and took the man and carried him found a
[1:34:01] place
[1:34:02] for him to be taken care of
[1:34:07] yes the way they were taught
[1:34:10] conditioned them to behave the way they
[1:34:13] were behaving
[1:34:15] the way they were taught
[1:34:20] some people this message has made them
[1:34:22] so proud
[1:34:24] so proud that they don't even have
[1:34:27] respect
[1:34:28] with the message respect they read and
[1:34:30] listening to they don't have respect
[1:34:32] they don't know what it is they can only
[1:34:35] tell you the prophet said
[1:34:36] quote 100 and this that's what the
[1:34:38] prophet said
[1:34:41] but respect as a life
[1:34:44] they don't have it the way you were
[1:34:47] taught
[1:34:50] is expressed in your action
[1:34:53] that's what jesus was talking about
[1:34:58] praise the lord the wise man built his
[1:35:02] house
[1:35:03] upon the rock
[1:35:06] and when the storm came the storm
[1:35:09] element

[1:36:04] walked him on us
