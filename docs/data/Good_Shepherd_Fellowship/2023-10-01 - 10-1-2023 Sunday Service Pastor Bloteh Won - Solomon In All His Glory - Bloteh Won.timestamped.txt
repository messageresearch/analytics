[42:03] sell uh uh during our Market there and
[42:06] the market there was Thursday so he
[42:08] would come Wednesday night and sleep and
[42:11] then sell on Thursday and then travel at
[42:14] the end of the day so uh uh uh there was
[42:19] there was a preacher in time one time
[42:20] they had a had a
[42:23] crusade and then uh somewhere I don't
[42:26] know how it is but he he got a hold of
[42:28] me and wanted me to preach on his
[42:30] Crusade and then when I when I preach on
[42:33] the Crusade that night I got I got lot
[42:35] of lot of friends that were that were
[42:38] blessed and they decided that they will
[42:40] they will come around and and support us
[42:43] so there was one brother that used to
[42:45] come to our church brother lenus he's a
[42:47] good friend to brother Celestine so
[42:49] Celestine will come and stay to Lea's
[42:51] house and then they will go to to
[42:53] business together and all of that so
[42:56] since he came was coming Wednesday night
[42:59] he will come with uh Celestine to church
[43:02] we just we just had a small group at
[43:04] that time the church were wheresoever
[43:06] two or three are gathered you know
[43:09] that's that's that was the church I was
[43:10] pastoring whever two or three I GA so he
[43:13] will come and then we will we will have
[43:16] service and then uh the next day but uh
[43:20] as as God would design it I saw that as
[43:24] God's design and God's provision
[43:26] all of these brothers they will come and
[43:29] then uh you know the the they really
[43:33] appreciate what we were doing we were
[43:35] all young men at the time so uh they
[43:39] took it upon them themselves in the way
[43:41] of supporting the ministry you know
[43:43] every time I think about it you know the
[43:45] Bible says that when Moses and were
[43:48] walking through the Wilderness their
[43:50] shoes never were out neither their
[43:53] clothes praise the Lord and it it was
[43:56] because of the the the supernatural
[43:58] presence of God the pillow of fire the
[44:01] glory of the Lord that was following the
[44:03] the people at the time uh
[44:07] uh I did not have that Supernatural
[44:10] presence in that way but I had it in a
[44:13] different way in a different way that
[44:16] now I have all of these friends that
[44:18] will come and visit us and uh Wednesday
[44:21] night and go to self so every time they
[44:24] come and uh uh uh they will they would
[44:27] take the best you know the best shirt
[44:30] the best trouses the best socks the best
[44:33] Singler the best they will take the best
[44:37] and uh and then uh they will come every
[44:40] I mean every every uh uh every week you
[44:43] know pretty much every week I had new
[44:45] clothes I didn't have anything to eat
[44:47] but I had new
[44:51] clothes praise the Lord yeah so they
[44:54] were very very good friend to me very
[44:57] very good friend so after a couple of
[44:59] years one time he came and he talked to
[45:01] me and and told me that he wanted me to
[45:03] come down to him to where he were living
[45:06] so I traveled there and then uh uh he
[45:10] asked me that he wanted for us to spend
[45:13] some time together with the Lord so we
[45:16] we decided to spend uh uh I think it was
[45:18] about 3 days uh seeking the face of the
[45:21] Lord because at the time he started
[45:23] feeling the desire to go into the
[45:27] Ministry so we spent some time together
[45:29] we prayed and uh uh you know I I just I
[45:33] just encouraged him you know uh he's
[45:35] he's a Pentecostal preacher he's uh you
[45:38] know uh and then uh but uh uh over the
[45:42] years and and uh you know the war came
[45:45] and we had to leave that area and we all
[45:47] moved down to to the capital AB Jan and
[45:50] and then uh after the while I heard he
[45:52] was around so uh he was sent for me uh
[45:56] uh uh over in in yugan you know to to
[46:01] come and see the little work that he was
[46:03] doing there praise the Lord so um uh you
[46:07] just he brought fls of memory to my mind
[46:10] and uh he came in yesterday evening he
[46:12] be leaving tomorrow evening and uh he
[46:15] just wanted us to spend some time
[46:17] together I mean uh because uh uh it's
[46:20] been it's been uh it's been a good wi
[46:23] since we seen one another uh pretty much
[46:26] uh yeah getting to some close to some 10
[46:30] years now uh since the last time we saw
[46:33] one another so I was so glad to see him
[46:35] and uh uh rev celest God bless you thank
[46:39] you for coming to to visit with us and

[46:50] give him the privilege to come and greet
[46:52] greet the church come come over and and
[46:54] just and greet the people
[47:06] what he's saying is true it was not easy
[47:10] I love you so much so I see him a young
[47:14] preacher thirsty for the work of God
[47:17] other people are looking for money B he
[47:20] was
[47:21] tasty sacrifice his time for God I said
[47:25] what kind kind of Life what kind of man
[47:27] is
[47:28] this so I said no I have to do my best
[47:31] for

[48:08] not your imagination the world and there
[48:11] are people that have the world of the
[48:13] Living

[48:16] that have the living world and that
[48:19] living world is going to help you when
[48:21] you got it you take it it will help you
[48:24] a lot because of the test he have for

[1:01:23] this morning
[1:01:27] let's go in first king chapter 4 this
[1:01:31] morning and we'll read from verse 20
[1:01:33] first king chapter 4 we will read from
[1:01:36] verse
[1:01:46] 20 praise the
[1:01:50] Lord first king
[1:01:52] 4:20 verse 20 Judah in Israel were many
[1:01:55] as the sand which is by the seed in
[1:02:00] multitude now what I want you to notice
[1:02:02] here is that this was a promise that God
[1:02:04] gave to Abraham I will bless you and
[1:02:07] your seed will be like the the sin at
[1:02:09] the seed of so right on the Fulfillment
[1:02:12] here is here is the the the the the
[1:02:16] kingdom of David here is the mesiah
[1:02:18] kingom here is the the promised son
[1:02:20] Kingdom you have to remember God
[1:02:22] promised Abraham that he will have a Son
[1:02:25] by whom he will be the father of many
[1:02:27] nations And that son was speaking of
[1:02:30] Jesus Christ even though Isaac was a
[1:02:33] type of the son and and and also Solomon
[1:02:36] here also is playing a road a type of
[1:02:39] the son so he's coming into office the
[1:02:41] kingdom is coming together the picture
[1:02:44] that God told Abraham is coming together
[1:02:46] Abraham was in the desert he couldn't
[1:02:48] see it he couldn't imagine how would
[1:02:50] this ever happen but the picture is
[1:02:52] coming together and God is
[1:02:55] re-echoing his
[1:02:57] promise I love that amen he's re-echoing
[1:03:01] his promise Judah and Israel were many
[1:03:04] as the sand which is by the seed in
[1:03:07] multitude eating and drinking and making
[1:03:09] Mary so Solomon reigned over all ketom
[1:03:12] from the river onto the land of the
[1:03:16] Philistine and onto the border of Egypt
[1:03:18] they brought presents and serve Solomon
[1:03:22] all the days of his life and Solomon
[1:03:25] provision for one day one day Just One
[1:03:29] Day
[1:03:31] meal praise the
[1:03:34] Lord oh my God he had a different L than
[1:03:38] mine his provision for one day was 30
[1:03:42] measure of fine flour and three score
[1:03:45] measure of MEK 10 fat oxin what will you
[1:03:48] do with order there
[1:03:51] Solomon praise the Lord was there nobody
[1:03:54] there to advise the
[1:03:58] king but you see the Lord bless you you
[1:04:00] can have your seat because I know I'm
[1:04:02] I'm beginning to do too much talking and
[1:04:04] I might keep you standing along but you
[1:04:06] see the the emphasis here that the
[1:04:09] scripture want you to grip is that this
[1:04:12] is a kingdom this is a son of
[1:04:17] prosperity amen Joseph was a son of
[1:04:23] prosperity but you see his
[1:04:26] Prosperity was to prosper the Earth his
[1:04:29] gift prospered the Earth at that time
[1:04:32] because he saved the Earth from
[1:04:36] drought so the the the the holy spirit
[1:04:39] is is trying is trying to make us is
[1:04:43] setting a scene so we can see what the
[1:04:46] Millennium will looks
[1:04:49] like because Solomon Reign is a type to
[1:04:53] the millennium
[1:04:55] is going is it's giving us the seam to
[1:04:57] let us to know that we will lack nothing
[1:05:00] in the
[1:05:02] Millennium praise the lord we will lack
[1:05:05] nothing brother brandham says all our
[1:05:08] wrongs will be made
[1:05:10] right praise the Lord
[1:05:13] amen I know I know people struggle with
[1:05:16] that you know what because brother brah
[1:05:18] talking in a way of marriage he says if
[1:05:20] we if we marry the wrong spouse there it
[1:05:22] will be me right and they think that
[1:05:24] maybe God will change their wife and
[1:05:26] gave them a new one no because sin will
[1:05:28] be bound so you will not have the
[1:05:30] trouble that you are
[1:05:32] having sin will be bound for the
[1:05:34] Thousand
[1:05:35] Years so it's not swapping
[1:05:40] mate it is just that all of the things
[1:05:43] that is making us not to understand one
[1:05:45] another will be done away with and we
[1:05:46] will be happy with one
[1:05:49] another and we be happy the question is
[1:05:52] why I couldn't get along with you
[1:05:57] praise the Lord we'll be happy ever amen
[1:06:02] we will be happy ever so the holy spirit
[1:06:04] yet is giving us a picture is is
[1:06:07] creating the scene even though there was
[1:06:10] a a a physical manifestation in uh in uh
[1:06:15] uh uh in uh the life of what was
[1:06:18] happening there with Solomon but it's
[1:06:20] setting the scene yet there's a reason
[1:06:22] why God allow
[1:06:24] everything that is in the
[1:06:27] Bible every name every nation even if we
[1:06:31] can't pronounce
[1:06:33] it praise the Lord there's a reason why
[1:06:36] he allow it in the holy street now so

[1:07:31] should not
[1:07:32] multiply uh herses neither should he
[1:07:36] multiply wives neither should he
[1:07:38] multiply so Solomon broke everything
[1:07:41] that Moses
[1:07:45] said are we
[1:07:50] together verse 27 for those officers Pro
[1:07:53] provided uh vure for for King Solomon
[1:07:56] and for all that came onto King Solomon
[1:08:01] table every man you see the you see the
[1:08:04] the the picture of the wedding supper
[1:08:07] when Jesus says everybody that came was
[1:08:10] giving a Welling G that was the same
[1:08:12] thing everybody that came to Feast with
[1:08:14] Solomon you were giving a special Rob to
[1:08:18] word everybody that sat down at Solomon
[1:08:22] table you were given a special Rob to
[1:08:27] word water kiddom it was called the
[1:08:31] Golden
[1:08:33] Age the Bible called it the golden age
[1:08:36] that was the Golden
[1:08:38] Age there was never a time like this in
[1:08:42] Israel there were Prosperity on every
[1:08:46] hand a type of our
[1:08:49] Millennium praise the Lord that's the
[1:08:52] reason why we shouldn't miss it
[1:08:55] whatever plans we are making on Earth
[1:08:58] include the Millennium in your
[1:09:00] plan praise the Lord include the
[1:09:03] Millennium in your plan praise the
[1:09:07] Lord 1,000
[1:09:12] years make your plans what are you going
[1:09:14] to do for 1,000
[1:09:18] years praise the Lord what are you going
[1:09:21] to do for 1,000 years
[1:09:30] everybody that came to the king to every
[1:09:32] man uh that sat at his table every man
[1:09:35] in his mouth they lack nothing nothing
[1:09:39] everybody had
[1:09:42] enough everybody had enough you see God
[1:09:46] said it in such a way in such a way in
[1:09:51] such a way that when we step out of this
[1:09:53] life and step into his presence you will
[1:09:57] have not one
[1:10:00] regret no matter what you suffer in this
[1:10:03] life and what you la in this
[1:10:08] life praise the
[1:10:10] Lord
[1:10:15] amen you see that's that is the hope
[1:10:17] that we have inside that is the thing
[1:10:20] that give us Grace for us to to to to
[1:10:24] Bear our trials for us to to be faithful
[1:10:27] to the Lord and keep trusting the Lord
[1:10:29] because we know there will be a time
[1:10:32] where we will lack
[1:10:35] nothing praise the Lord and you know the
[1:10:38] reason why God designed it that way is
[1:10:41] because the only thing you will need to
[1:10:44] do is
[1:10:47] worship you will not need to work you
[1:10:50] will not need a cook you will not the
[1:10:52] only thing you will need need to do is
[1:10:55] worship so everything is
[1:11:01] supplied so you think about it now in a
[1:11:04] time where we have all of our challenges
[1:11:07] if the grace of God can raise you to a
[1:11:09] place where you can have no excuse you
[1:11:12] can make no excuse in your mind say Lord
[1:11:15] no matter what I'm going through I'm
[1:11:16] going to serve you then how much more
[1:11:19] when you have
[1:11:21] plenty praise the Lord
[1:11:26] amen the human the human mind and the
[1:11:29] human nature every time h a man in his
[1:11:32] Fallen state will say well if the Lord
[1:11:34] blessed me I will give it if you cannot
[1:11:36] give him now while you are
[1:11:38] lacking if you have a house full you
[1:11:41] will never be able to give him
[1:11:44] that's if you cannot make time now for
[1:11:47] him why you are busy and you have
[1:11:50] strings everywhere and and iron in the
[1:11:52] fire everywhere you can't make time for
[1:11:55] him when you have all of the time you
[1:11:58] will not be able to make time for him
[1:11:59] look at the Young Rich ruler example
[1:12:02] look at the Young Rich
[1:12:07] ruler because he rejected Jesus the
[1:12:11] Bible says he went on prospering now at
[1:12:14] a time where he had enough what did he
[1:12:17] say oh my soul lay down and
[1:12:20] sleep the internal life that he was
[1:12:22] seeking for he he never went seeking for
[1:12:30] it praise the
[1:12:33] Lord you have to realize it's it's it's
[1:12:36] not it's not what we have in our hands
[1:12:39] that God want is what we have in our
[1:12:44] hearts it's what we have in our heart
[1:12:48] there was something that blew my
[1:12:49] mind blew my mind uh during the week
[1:12:54] uh and I was listening to to
[1:12:58] something by the way there is there is
[1:13:00] one Young Brother uh uh over in Alabama
[1:13:04] every time he talk to me please greet
[1:13:05] the church for me please greet the
[1:13:07] church oh yeah I would do it I will
[1:13:08] greet the church for you I forgot keep
[1:13:10] forgetting so I got to my office I wrote
[1:13:12] it down to remind myself so church I'm
[1:13:16] greeting you for brother Benjamin amen
[1:13:22] okay
[1:13:24] every time you remind me I feel
[1:13:26] [Laughter]
[1:13:29] guilty so as soon I got through talking
[1:13:32] with him I just wrote it down and I put
[1:13:34] it on my notep good that I took it it's
[1:13:36] right before me so so I I was I was I
[1:13:39] was I was listening to this thing and
[1:13:41] and it was actually a Jewish robber that
[1:13:43] was talking I was I was I was studying
[1:13:46] something I was looking into something
[1:13:48] uh uh uh a testimony I will share it
[1:13:50] with you very beautiful but but he says
[1:13:53] something something he said he said God
[1:13:56] don't need our
[1:13:59] praise we need to praise
[1:14:05] God when he said it was almost like my
[1:14:08] hair spin around my
[1:14:10] shoulder I said what did he said just
[1:14:13] just
[1:14:14] now God don't need our praise we need to
[1:14:19] praise
[1:14:20] God it might sound like is the same but
[1:14:23] it's not the
[1:14:25] same praise the lord it's not the
[1:14:32] same it's not the same because if you
[1:14:35] don't praise God God will stay
[1:14:39] exist if you don't praise him it will
[1:14:41] not change him from being God let me
[1:14:44] tell you he have the births to praise
[1:14:46] him he has the leaves to praise
[1:14:49] him the heaven declare the glory of God
[1:14:53] yes so if you as an individual will
[1:14:56] birth in your body if you don't praise
[1:14:59] God it won't change him a
[1:15:06] bit we need to feel the need we need to
[1:15:10] feel it in us that we need to praise him
[1:15:14] we need to join the
[1:15:16] creation we need to join we we must feel
[1:15:20] the
[1:15:20] need praise the Lord
[1:15:24] that we need to praise
[1:15:28] him are we
[1:15:36] together when we have such a
[1:15:41] generation in such an age that we are
[1:15:48] living the people are coming across and
[1:15:52] attacking God let me get to this this
[1:15:53] thing here quickly I'm I'm hoping
[1:15:55] that'll keep you long since we have to
[1:15:56] come back uh uh uh this evening for the
[1:16:00] time of prayer and uh and and
[1:16:05] communion so the scripture yet is giving
[1:16:08] giving us uh h a beautiful picture here
[1:16:12] beautiful picture let's drop down to
[1:16:13] verse 29 it's it's right in the same
[1:16:15] reading there and God gave Solomon
[1:16:17] wisdom and understanding exceeding much
[1:16:20] and largess of heart gave him such a
[1:16:24] heart to be able to
[1:16:29] accommodate Solomon has such a heart to
[1:16:32] take in to
[1:16:34] accommodate praise the Lord largess of
[1:16:37] heart even as the sin that is on the
[1:16:41] seed Shore still speaking about that
[1:16:43] promise still talking about the promise
[1:16:45] of
[1:16:47] Abraham praise the
[1:16:52] Lord
[1:16:55] and Solomon wisdom see the wisdom of all
[1:16:58] the children of the East country and the
[1:17:01] wisdom of
[1:17:03] Egypt verse 32 he
[1:17:05] speaks uh 3,000 Proverbs and his Psalms
[1:17:09] were
[1:17:12] 1,5 and he speaks of trees from the
[1:17:15] cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto
[1:17:18] the house of uh that sprink it out of
[1:17:20] the well he you know he he made song out
[1:17:23] of everything he
[1:17:25] saw he said look at the
[1:17:28] ants he said you slothful you lazy man
[1:17:31] look at the ants the ants know how to
[1:17:34] gather food in the winter or in the
[1:17:37] summer to prepare for the
[1:17:39] winter everything he look around you see
[1:17:42] the the the gift there was that he could
[1:17:45] see God in everything that he look
[1:17:49] around praise the Lord when he got over
[1:17:52] to the book of ecclesiastic he talk
[1:17:54] about Vanity Vanity all is Vanity what
[1:17:57] what he said the underline thing in that
[1:17:59] book you have to remember he said
[1:18:01] everything under the
[1:18:06] Sun so he was trying to make us to know
[1:18:10] that beyond the sun is not
[1:18:14] vanity everything under the sun is
[1:18:17] temporary everything under the song will
[1:18:20] pass away everything under the song will
[1:18:24] change and then he closed the book
[1:18:27] remember your creator in the days of
[1:18:30] your
[1:18:32] youth are we together so we talking
[1:18:36] about this man Solomon uh let's go right
[1:18:39] there over in Luke chapter
[1:18:42] 12 Luke chapter 12 that's where I took
[1:18:46] my uh my uh thought from this
[1:18:51] morning l Luke chap 12 Luke 12 I mean
[1:18:56] Matthew chap 12 I said Luke 12 but
[1:19:05] one there's something in in Matthew
[1:19:08] chapter 12 the scripture also there too
[1:19:10] is in uh Matthew chapter 6 but I just
[1:19:13] wrote wrote down Luke chapter 12 this
[1:19:15] morning because that's that's where I I
[1:19:18] kind of forgot it from now so Luke
[1:19:20] chapter 12 let's read verse 27 Luke chap
[1:19:24] 12 Luke 12 verse
[1:19:28] 27 Jesus this is our lord Jesus that is
[1:19:32] making this comparison that I want for
[1:19:34] us to pay attention to Jesus here is
[1:19:36] saying consider the lady how they grow
[1:19:41] the to n the Spain that and yet I say
[1:19:46] unto you that Solomon in all his glory
[1:19:49] that's where I took my my my my subject
[1:19:52] from this morning Solomon in all his
[1:19:56] glory so Jesus here is is is bringing a
[1:20:02] comparison between Solomon
[1:20:06] glory and another Glory he's not
[1:20:09] mentioning but he's bringing a
[1:20:11] comparison here and and and and what I
[1:20:15] want you to pay attention to is that in
[1:20:19] the way that Jesus is bringing this if
[1:20:22] you can gra it Solomon Glory was outward
[1:20:27] Glory that is the reason why we could
[1:20:30] count the fats we could count how many
[1:20:33] uh food he ate that or numbers were
[1:20:35] given to him because they were all
[1:20:37] outward they were all
[1:20:40] visible they could tell they could tell
[1:20:43] that that that nations were sending
[1:20:45] clothes to Solomon because it looks like
[1:20:47] he changed every
[1:20:49] second when he just go in to come out
[1:20:51] he's wearing something
[1:20:53] different they were all outward Glory
[1:20:56] but yes see Jesus here now making this
[1:20:59] comparison he says consider the
[1:21:03] lady consider the
[1:21:07] lady How It
[1:21:10] Grow How It Grow can we say that
[1:21:15] together How It Grow can we say that
[1:21:18] together How It Grow there's a reason
[1:21:21] why I'm I'm I'm repeating that because
[1:21:25] consider the lady Jesus is saying and
[1:21:28] he's going to let you know that is the
[1:21:30] same way God is dealing with you your
[1:21:32] glory will not come one your glory is a
[1:21:35] growing Glory consider the lady How It
[1:21:39] Grow we go from glory to
[1:21:48] glory praise the Lord consider the
[1:21:51] letter how it grow
[1:21:54] we must be willing to grow and to grow
[1:21:58] we must be willing to
[1:21:59] change because that's one thing that
[1:22:01] comes with growth is
[1:22:03] change are we together consider the lady
[1:22:07] how they grow the to net the spin net
[1:22:10] and yet I said unto you that Solomon in
[1:22:13] all his glory was not array like one of
[1:22:18] these if then God so cloth the grass the
[1:22:23] lady the grass that is just a grass
[1:22:27] which is today in the field and tomorrow
[1:22:30] is cast in the oven how much more will
[1:22:34] he clothe
[1:22:35] you how much more will he clothe
[1:22:40] you praise the
[1:22:42] Lord
[1:22:45] amen how much more will he clothe you
[1:22:49] Solomon in all of his glory all of his
[1:22:52] rayen and everything he can change and
[1:22:55] he can wear cannot be compared to this
[1:22:59] this this Chanel that Jesus is take
[1:23:01] taking this
[1:23:03] comparison if the
[1:23:06] father can give the lady of the
[1:23:10] field praise the Lord and you have to
[1:23:13] realize that the lady of the field when
[1:23:16] the lady changes his Rob is not taking
[1:23:20] it from up down it's taking it from
[1:23:22] inside
[1:23:24] out
[1:23:27] amen are we
[1:23:30] together praise the
[1:23:33] Lord if then God so clothe the grass
[1:23:37] which is today in the field and tomorrow
[1:23:40] is cast in the oven how much more will
[1:23:42] he clothe you oh ye of little
[1:23:47] faith oh ye of little
[1:23:50] faith you know what Jesus is trying to
[1:23:53] help us to see
[1:23:56] it he want you to start seeing from the
[1:23:59] inside out not from the outside
[1:24:03] in Praise the Lord because after the
[1:24:07] lady it TOS after the lady struggle in
[1:24:10] the mud and and it brings out that LE
[1:24:14] and it it PS out his perfume and
[1:24:16] everything the one that come outs after
[1:24:18] the while it dries out it dies but again
[1:24:21] there is something that comes back from
[1:24:23] inside the next season and it redress
[1:24:26] himself it's not dressing itself from
[1:24:29] outside on is dressing itself from
[1:24:32] inside
[1:24:33] out oh ye of little
[1:24:37] faith if you can look at how much value
[1:24:41] that God puts in you that he can call
[1:24:44] you his sons and daughters that he can
[1:24:46] pour a predestinated seed in your sick
[1:24:49] body and pre pour a predestinated seed
[1:24:52] in your poor body no matter what family
[1:24:54] you coming from where you were born but
[1:24:58] yet he set his love upon you Jesus is
[1:25:01] saying oh ye of little faith your faith
[1:25:04] is only captured by the outside the
[1:25:06] temporary things your faith has never
[1:25:08] got the revelation of what is really in
[1:25:11] you you have not C the revelation of who
[1:25:15] you are that's why you
[1:25:17] complain that's why you get into the
[1:25:20] right race that's why you get into
[1:25:22] comparing because you have really not
[1:25:25] got the
[1:25:26] revelation of who you are because who
[1:25:30] you are is not defined by what around
[1:25:34] you what you have around you who you are
[1:25:37] is
[1:25:38] defined but what is in
[1:25:41] you oh ye of little faith praise the
[1:25:45] Lord amen
[1:25:47] hallelujah amen you love the
[1:25:51] Lord

[1:26:02] faith and seek not ye
[1:26:05] what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink
[1:26:10] neither be ye of a doubtful
[1:26:17] mind for all these things do the nations
[1:26:22] of of the word seek all these things
[1:26:25] that is very common to everybody that is
[1:26:29] born everybody on Earth is common to
[1:26:31] them but for you a predestinated seed
[1:26:34] you a child of God it must be different
[1:26:38] that's what he's
[1:26:39] saying for all these things the nation

[1:32:45] his kingdom he was
[1:32:48] given all things he he he he had plenty
[1:32:53] he had plenty it was it's a kingdom that
[1:32:56] was
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:58] F he never like anything the Bible says
[1:33:01] those that came at the king's meal never
[1:33:04] like anything and I pray that when we
[1:33:06] come to the house of God we will not
[1:33:08] like anything amen praise the lord we
[1:33:11] can say that my joy is
[1:33:16] forth I mean it's a curse to come to the
[1:33:18] house of God and go back homeside
[1:33:25] Jesus had his table spread unless we are
[1:33:28] preaching some kind of a dogat or we we
[1:33:30] are preaching something unless it's not
[1:33:32] the Living
[1:33:33] Word but if you pray to God that God
[1:33:37] should speak to you you pray to God that
[1:33:39] you you want your soul to be fed if you
[1:33:42] really talk to almighty
[1:33:44] God praise the Lord
[1:33:50] hallelujah and if I what I'm preaching

[1:33:54] talk to me come and tell me S I don't I
[1:33:57] don't I don't feel fed I mean it it

[1:34:01] you and I'm not feeding your
[1:34:05] soul it will not be ajusting for you to
[1:34:08] be praying for the
[1:34:11] preacher just to come to be entertained
[1:34:13] and you not you you are not really being
[1:34:16] fed
[1:34:19] spiritually come and talk to me
[1:34:24] are we
[1:34:29] together oh praise the
[1:34:34] Lord what a what an awesome God we
[1:34:37] serve what a wonderful father we
[1:34:50] serve
[1:34:53] sorry my brain is not too good like it
[1:34:55] used to be so have to write things down
[1:34:57] to remind
[1:35:01] myself now so let's go into this this
[1:35:04] morning as we look at it see Jesus here
[1:35:06] bringing this comparison Solomon in all
[1:35:09] of his
[1:35:10] glory can never be
[1:35:13] compared to one of these in another
[1:35:16] sense the way Jesus is bringing the the
[1:35:19] the comparison Solomon in all of his
[1:35:22] glory cannot be compared to your
[1:35:27] glory your glory is not a physical Glory
[1:35:31] your glory is a spirit you see the thing
[1:35:33] that is that when we were talking on
[1:35:34] about the Tabernacle that's where I got
[1:35:36] a taught about this is
[1:35:40] because what we call the sh the
[1:35:44] shakina okay it's called It's called The
[1:35:47] shakina Glory but the glory is called
[1:35:50] the shakina
[1:35:54] praise the
[1:35:56] Lord the Shak the shaking out okay which
[1:36:00] which best way it is but you see that it
[1:36:02] was
[1:36:03] something it was something now on the
[1:36:08] the the Tabernacle with Moses you have
[1:36:11] to know the Tabernacle was moved from
[1:36:14] one place to another there was a
[1:36:16] beautiful picture I saw but uh Pastor
[1:36:19] Jim yam show me there last week we were
[1:36:21] we were helping that group down there
[1:36:23] and he showed me a very beautiful
[1:36:25] picture now what it is is that uh uh uh
[1:36:28] is is a pillow of fire like a light from
[1:36:31] the heaven right
[1:36:33] over the the the the the
[1:36:37] Tabernacle praise the Lord amen now but
[1:36:41] when it came to Solomon Temple the the
[1:36:44] the pillow of fire the the the shakana
[1:36:46] glory was not seen from
[1:36:50] outside the the the the the glory filled
[1:36:53] the temple that's what the Bible says
[1:36:55] the glory of the Lord filled the temple
[1:36:58] that even the priest did not had a place
[1:37:01] to
[1:37:02] minister praise the Lord now so you see
[1:37:05] what God was witnessing to those people
[1:37:09] is that he want his children to live in
[1:37:12] his
[1:37:15] glory he want his glory to to fill our
[1:37:19] homes his glory will fill our hearts and
[1:37:21] fill our mind the glory of the Lord will
[1:37:24] just be all around
[1:37:30] us are we
[1:37:33] together oh
[1:37:35] my sin is not a good thing our natural
[1:37:39] birth is not a good thing neither
[1:37:42] denomination has helped this the the
[1:37:44] situation because it have just kept us
[1:37:48] in in in such a deprived state
[1:37:51] when God had bestowed so much Glory upon
[1:37:59] you praise the Lord so much
[1:38:04] Glory are we together let's look at
[1:38:07] another
[1:38:09] one let's look at another another
[1:38:12] scripture yeah uh we we want a look
[1:38:16] at are you are we
[1:38:20] together
[1:38:23] Matthew chapter
[1:38:25] 12 Matthew chapter 12 we read Luke
[1:38:28] chapter 12 let's read Matthew chapter 12
[1:38:30] Jesus again he's coming in another
[1:38:32] comparison here I'll read I read a few
[1:38:34] quotes to you but I I want to I want to
[1:38:37] I want to you to grab my thoughts what
[1:38:39] I'm going this
[1:38:46] morning
[1:38:50] amen
[1:38:56] Matthew chapter 12 let's read verse
[1:39:00] 24 Matthew 12:
[1:39:06] 24 Solomon in all his
[1:39:09] glory you love the
[1:39:12] Lord did I say 24:42
[1:39:17] sorry
[1:39:19] 42 now Matthew
[1:39:22] 42 turn it around from 24 to 42 let's
[1:39:26] read
[1:39:29] 42 now this is this is the same time
[1:39:32] here now the the queen of the South
[1:39:35] shall rise up in the Judgment with this
[1:39:39] generation and shall condemn it for she
[1:39:42] came from the uttermost part of the
[1:39:45] earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon
[1:39:48] Behold a greater then Solomon is here
[1:39:54] praise the Lord now Jesus is is saying
[1:39:57] he stay in this in this place of
[1:39:59] comparison he's trying to grab our
[1:40:01] attention to something he's trying to
[1:40:04] draw our attention so we can be able to
[1:40:07] appreciate something here he says the
[1:40:09] queen of the South it will rise up
[1:40:11] against this this generation she came
[1:40:14] from far she she travel hundreds of
[1:40:17] miles and like brother BR would dribe it
[1:40:19] with all the danger that was on on the
[1:40:21] road because she heard about the wisdom
[1:40:23] of Solomon she traveled and she sat the
[1:40:26] Bible says she sat she asked Solomon all
[1:40:28] of her
[1:40:30] questions praise the lord and there was
[1:40:33] now one that she asked that he did not
[1:40:38] answer but yet Jesus is identifying
[1:40:42] something here just like he brought the
[1:40:44] lady on the other side yeah he saying
[1:40:47] also a greater than
[1:40:49] Solomon
[1:40:53] amen he says a greater than Solomon is
[1:40:58] here so when you look at you look at
[1:41:02] Solomon Glory you can also realize that
[1:41:06] there is a greater glory than what
[1:41:09] Solomon
[1:41:10] have remember that Solomon was a type of
[1:41:14] Jesus Christ just like Joseph was a type
[1:41:17] of Jesus just like Isaac was a type of
[1:41:20] Jesus they were all proning to the
[1:41:22] promised son and here he coming on the
[1:41:25] scene and he says you you you seen
[1:41:27] Solomon Glory you heard about it but I'm
[1:41:29] telling you a greater than Solomon is
[1:41:32] here then the kind of mind now is
[1:41:35] looking around and says well we see you
[1:41:38] you only wear only one
[1:41:41] Rob Solomon changed his Rob every minute
[1:41:45] but the greater than Solomon had only
[1:41:48] one fly
[1:41:49] Rob praise the Lord but what did the
[1:41:52] glory that he had that was God in
[1:41:59] flesh
[1:42:01] amen the glory that he had is that he
[1:42:05] was God in
[1:42:11] flesh praise the
[1:42:15] Lord that he was now born of a sex birth
[1:42:21] but he was born of a virgin birth and
[1:42:24] God was wearing his
[1:42:27] flesh Solomon was wearing clothes from
[1:42:29] all the nation but God was wearing this
[1:42:32] man flesh and that's the same thing God
[1:42:35] want to wear your
[1:42:43] flesh I'm looking for room to
[1:42:47] preach I'm looking for room to preach
[1:42:51] because I'm feeling
[1:42:53] inspired praise the Lord
[1:42:57] hallelujah
[1:42:59] amen he could change his clothes by
[1:43:02] meaning and meaning and meaning and hour
[1:43:04] and and he come then he get another rope
[1:43:06] around his neck and another thing on him
[1:43:09] and and then he just Shunk it down and
[1:43:10] he pick up another one again and wear
[1:43:14] it Jesus had one
[1:43:19] Rob
[1:43:21] and even at his crucification they
[1:43:23] gamble over his
[1:43:27] rob it did not had no value to
[1:43:30] him because he know that God almighty
[1:43:34] God was wearing his
[1:43:41] flesh whatever Solomon was wearing was
[1:43:44] made by men falling
[1:43:48] men but God was wearing that
[1:43:52] body that came out of a
[1:43:55] virgin God was wearing that body that
[1:43:58] sisting element God was wearing
[1:44:03] it praise the Lord I was reading
[1:44:07] something I hope I can find it this
[1:44:08] morning uh uh uh uh they describ Solomon
[1:44:12] Throne it was made out of
[1:44:15] gold it had two lions when you clim into
[1:44:19] the step of his throne

[1:46:41] the rebuilding of the temple has never
[1:46:44] come to the same
[1:46:48] level it have never come to the glory
[1:46:51] that it had when Solomon built
[1:46:55] it because the the person that built the
[1:46:58] temple after the temple was destroyed
[1:47:00] you have to remember the Babylonians
[1:47:01] looted Solomon Temple and they destroy
[1:47:04] it and the person that rebuilt the
[1:47:06] temple was
[1:47:07] Hera well he's not a jewel
[1:47:10] either so he would not have the value he
[1:47:14] just buildt it so that people can have a
[1:47:15] place to worship he won't have the same
[1:47:18] kind of a value and inspiration that
[1:47:21] Solomon
[1:47:23] had so since that time they have never
[1:47:26] had a temple like Solomon had but the
[1:47:30] one that said greater than Solomon is
[1:47:33] here praise the Lord he said destroy
[1:47:37] this Temple and in 3 days I will raise
[1:47:41] it

[1:47:51] glory but he said destroy this temple in
[1:47:55] 3 days I will raise it up from mortar to
[1:48:07] immortality oh
[1:48:14] man may God help
[1:48:17] us that we will not just be entertained
[1:48:20] by the word but we will be so captured
[1:48:23] by this word we will be so captured that
[1:48:27] we will drive
[1:48:28] into
[1:48:31] discovering discovering the beauty the
[1:48:38] treasure the thing that the father have
[1:48:40] in store for

[1:49:13] South is the bride it's his own bride
[1:49:17] his own Queen are coming to hear his

[2:00:55] position in Christ I put post it up
[2:00:59] there and this one kind of for hit me it
[2:01:03] hit me in a way
[2:01:05] that there that was so
[2:01:08] beautiful let me read it to
[2:01:12] you we should be so on fire for
[2:01:16] God we should be going day and night
[2:01:19] nothing should be able to stop us and we
[2:01:23] should be so sweet and so pleasant so
[2:01:26] kind so Christlike in our
[2:01:30] life this is not just a
[2:01:33] makeover it's not a makeover it's not
[2:01:36] it's not it's not something that we can
[2:01:38] we can
[2:01:40] no it's it's all part of the lady's
[2:01:44] character you got to work at it amen you
[2:01:48] got you got to stay in the presence of
[2:01:50] Christ you got to fall in love with him
[2:01:53] you got to say Jesus take this thing out
[2:01:55] of me I don't like
[2:01:58] it amen I don't like it you have to find
[2:02:02] it in yourself and say Lord I don't like
[2:02:04] this
[2:02:11] thing so Christ like in our life it
[2:02:15] takes everyday life you see brother B
[2:02:18] say it takes every everyday life for us
[2:02:20] to come to that place not just a Sunday
[2:02:23] morning
[2:02:25] thing it takes an everyday
[2:02:30] life what what what we don't realize is
[2:02:33] our everyday life that we
[2:02:38] live is part of your internal
[2:02:43] life praise the Lord because you don't
[2:02:46] get internal life when you get there
[2:02:50] Jesus said if you
[2:02:52] believe and you receive him you he will
[2:02:55] give you eternal life it begins right
[2:03:01] here so if you are a son of God and you
[2:03:04] have the Holy Ghost your everyday life
[2:03:07] is part of your internal
[2:03:10] life you are just living portion of it
[2:03:13] behind the side of the
[2:03:17] river
[2:03:19] you see the church word has made those
[2:03:22] things something for the future when you
[2:03:25] die you go to heaven then you get
[2:03:27] eternal life they make it for the
[2:03:29] future so it deprive us it deprive the
[2:03:35] people from breaking into that reality
[2:03:38] of Christ
[2:03:42] life because they make it for the future
[2:03:44] when you die you go to heaven and Jesus
[2:03:46] will give you eternal life it begins
[2:03:47] right here
[2:03:52] praise the Lord so I don't know are you
[2:03:54] using your internal life to
[2:03:58] force you using your eternal life to
[2:04:01] fight when eternal life supposed to be
[2:04:04] living for
[2:04:11] others consider the lady of the field
[2:04:13] how it grow it told and spin yet I said
[2:04:16] unto you Solomon in all of his glory
[2:04:18] it's not a raay like one Solomon had
[2:04:22] robs that was AR raay with glorious skin
[2:04:27] and needle work in things that was how
[2:04:29] that guy clothes was very
[2:04:33] expensive very
[2:04:35] expensive I mean he could run some of
[2:04:38] our billion near
[2:04:40] Brook if they would just want to buy one
[2:04:43] of his
[2:04:47] attire
[2:04:50] if you will bring that nature of work
[2:04:52] year now to this present market value it
[2:04:55] will run some of our billing here
[2:05:06] broke his clothes was neither
[2:05:09] work that wasn't what he was talking
[2:05:12] about you see so brother bam said that
[2:05:14] was not what Jesus was talking about you
[2:05:16] were not talking about you know the skin
[2:05:18] the Glorious King and needle work no in
[2:05:21] order for a lady to grow it has to toore
[2:05:26] both day and night praise the Lord
[2:05:31] amen it has to to is something that you
[2:05:34] we have to be conscious of we just don't
[2:05:37] go go out of church step out of church
[2:05:39] and then we forget that we you are a son
[2:05:40] of God you forget that you are a
[2:05:42] daughter of God and have the devil to
[2:05:44] have the best of you until the next
[2:05:47] service
[2:05:49] it's something that we to we toore it
[2:05:53] praise the Lord I'm not going to allow
[2:05:56] this thing to back me I'm going to fight
[2:05:57] my way through I'm going to rebuke the
[2:06:01] devil I'm going to stand Toe to Toe with
[2:06:09] him it has to told and there both they
[2:06:12] and night what do you want to come up
[2:06:16] back here on the little end of the
[2:06:20] line if the
[2:06:22] righteous be scarcely saved where will
[2:06:26] the Sinners that's the
[2:06:28] unbeliever and the ungodly the man that
[2:06:32] he the word and refus to walk in
[2:06:37] it that's
[2:06:40] ungodliness that's ungodliness hearing
[2:06:43] the word and can never come to a place
[2:06:45] of
[2:06:46] Victory can never come to a place of
[2:06:50] position in Romans chapter 1 Paul
[2:06:53] identify
[2:06:55] that
[2:06:57] amen say the wrath of God is against
[2:06:59] them that hear the
[2:07:02] word and take the word of God in on
[2:07:07] righteousness God man man that hear the
[2:07:09] word and refuse to walk in it now what
[2:07:13] are you going to do now see where he's
[2:07:15] going to take this now he's going to
[2:07:17] take it straight into ad
[2:07:19] that is the thing that kind of hit me we
[2:07:22] look at this adoption thing and the way
[2:07:25] we look at it the way we look at
[2:07:30] it brother brandham gave us a picture of
[2:07:34] what would take place in the
[2:07:36] East okay a son on a tutorship and a
[2:07:41] father right ready to adopt him will now
[2:07:45] bring set up a stage and and make it
[2:07:47] public
[2:07:49] but it's it's completely different the
[2:07:51] way that he's dealing with us under the
[2:07:53] Holy
[2:07:55] Ghost
[2:07:57] amen the way he dealing with us honor
[2:07:59] the Holy
[2:08:03] Ghost praise the
[2:08:08] Lord adoption plac in position where
[2:08:10] they are show me word they are God
[2:08:14] calling his children
[2:08:16] aside by manifestation
[2:08:20] they don't have to say one word about
[2:08:23] it you see something happen positionally
[2:08:26] placing his sons getting getting him
[2:08:29] into order just exactly with the same
[2:08:34] thing he just as in much Authority his
[2:08:40] word just as good as the ACT Angel
[2:08:44] better amen even his words is better
[2:08:47] than the ACT
[2:08:49] injur that's the Son of God now I was I
[2:08:53] was telling on that
[2:08:55] Authority because you read in the Bible
[2:08:57] there the Bible say Jesus Jesus says I
[2:08:59] have given you power to cast out
[2:09:02] scorpions praise the Lord now so that
[2:09:06] that now is taking in a place where the
[2:09:09] church go and and and you know we try to
[2:09:12] use H you know physical Satan I rebuke
[2:09:15] you Satan I you know you you try because
[2:09:17] you think it's power that's the way you
[2:09:19] understand
[2:09:21] power but the prophet will come and let
[2:09:23] us know that he says see right at this
[2:09:28] fourway
[2:09:31] stop a policeman can come he uh slim and
[2:09:35] you know uh uh weak in the
[2:09:38] body but he can come right in the middle
[2:09:41] of that
[2:09:42] road and he can put his hands up praise
[2:09:46] the Lord and in a truck with hundreds of
[2:09:50] tons when you see that man standing in
[2:09:52] the middle of the road the D the driver
[2:09:55] has to run for the
[2:09:57] brakes praise the Lord now as I was
[2:10:00] thinking about
[2:10:02] that I thought also what if a man that
[2:10:08] is a police officer if he's not dressed
[2:10:13] right even though he's a police
[2:10:16] officer praise the Lord
[2:10:19] amen he have his bash in his pocket he's
[2:10:23] wearing some kind of a
[2:10:26] shirs and he get right in the middle of
[2:10:28] the road and says
[2:10:32] stop I'm a police
[2:10:35] officer praise the Lord so you see it's
[2:10:38] not uh it's not the man that the truck
[2:10:41] tried to to to to to
[2:10:46] respect is the uniform
[2:10:50] he's wearing a uniform that has been
[2:10:53] given to
[2:10:55] him by the
[2:10:58] state praise the Lord he's wearing a
[2:11:03] badge that tells that he has the
[2:11:06] authority to do that
[2:11:09] work praise the Lord so you see it's not
[2:11:13] it's not the
[2:11:15] shouting it's not him standing there and
[2:11:18] streaming Satan about you in Jesus
[2:11:25] no is when a Son of God can dress right
[2:11:30] and live right a daughter of God can
[2:11:34] take a position in the word and live
[2:11:37] right and dress
[2:11:41] right then the authority of the kingdom
[2:11:43] comes behind
[2:11:47] you praise the Lord that Authority comes
[2:11:51] behind
[2:11:52] you you don't see him in the middle of
[2:11:54] the road screaming he just have to lift
[2:11:56] his
[2:12:03] hands praise the
[2:12:05] Lord the church has created a lot of
[2:12:08] work out oh let's work out and work out
[2:12:12] and I I rebuke you fire and it's just
[2:12:16] emotional workout
[2:12:23] if that man in the truck can recognize
[2:12:26] that police officer there by the way he
[2:12:28] dress and the authority that he
[2:12:31] represents that's the same way the
[2:12:37] devil when a Son of God or the daughter
[2:12:40] of God says Satan I rebuke
[2:12:43] you praise the Lord amen now even even
[2:12:48] over in the book of Jude I should find a
[2:12:49] place to stop here now I'm I'm going too
[2:12:51] far yeah and even in the book of
[2:12:55] Jude JW was talking about apostasis that
[2:12:58] comes upon the Earth and he says that it
[2:13:01] gets to a place where men will be
[2:13:04] speaking against
[2:13:06] Authority he said even see the angel the
[2:13:09] Archangel Michael when he rebuked the
[2:13:13] devil he never used no raing accusation
[2:13:16] or he said Satan the Lord rebuke
[2:13:23] thee amen he never went he never went
[2:13:27] against him as Angel and angels He show
[2:13:30] him a higher

[2:13:42] devil you you you ugly devil you dead
[2:13:44] devil oh no he just said Satan the
[2:13:50] Lord he show him a higher
[2:13:57] authority that's all we need to do come
[2:14:00] hon a higher
[2:14:06] authority and our higher authority is
[2:14:09] the
[2:14:10] word praise the Lord in Psalm chapter 38
