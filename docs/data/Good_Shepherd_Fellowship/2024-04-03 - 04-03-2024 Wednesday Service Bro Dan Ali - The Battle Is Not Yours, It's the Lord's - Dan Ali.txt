and uh we bring greetings from the Saints uh over in New York brother Simon and the group uh we had a good service with them the Lord was able to help us uh Friday night Saturday evening and Sunday morning and uh we also believe that the angel visited the neighborhood here amen praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of praise for hallelujah amen amen amen it was it was a visitation praise the Lord hallelujah and and we and we are grateful we are very grateful that he knows our address amen we are very grateful that he know our address we know the testimony of the Angel visiting the neighborhood and it was not only for that day it is still the same today amen is uh it's uh it's the attitude of the people towards the word that brings the angel in the neighborhood praise the Lord and uh for for about uh 25 going 27 years now we've being on the corner of this street this little place been dedicated to the house of God and uh and God has a reason why he stay keeping us here praise the Lord before we pray I just I just wanted to take uh uh this time to just remind us you know he has a reason why he keeping us on the corner of this uh Street because we have to know you know when uh Jesus gave that parable about uh uh the lord of the Harvest when he sent out you know his servants to go and call people to the feast you know uh uh and the people that were invited were all giving excuses and then he said told his servant go in the highways go in the byways praise the Lord and and for the time that uh uh some of the time we have SE around here we have seen people uh uh we have seen the Lord bringing people right from the streets you know uh people come without none of us inviting them and that is the reason why that you know we owe those people our best behavior because we did not invite them we must not use our attitude to send them away so uh uh uh and then I learned there child there was a young lady I think niik that came in the prayer in the prayer line on Sunday and just before I will I will start heading to church tonight brother brother zah Chason called me and he wanted me to bring greetings to the church and also thank you for for supporting the meetings on the weekend but he called me and then uh he told me he s brother one there there was a young lady that came through the prayer line and uh and I think she was under the influence of alcohol he he said for some reason right after the the service when I went over to the hotel I mean to the restaurant to eat that smell could not leave me he said when I went to my hotel room the smell could not leave me he says from that time till this time you know I still feel the smell yeah you know I'm I'm I'm I'm using it that way I still feel the smell I still smell the smell because I believe it was more of the spirit than just the smell praise the Lord and so he told me he said I just had a I just had a burden on my heart and just believing that God will deliver that girl from whatever Spirit was bothering her because from Sunday till now I can they smell it Spirits can smell Spirit have sin they can smell right praise the Lord you know and and brother Bram talks taught us about Spirit congregates you know when people come together every one of us we bring Spirits into the building and and and and sometimes just like the preacher when the preacher is preaching the Holy Ghost is streaming for help the Holy Ghost is stream screaming saying somebody believe me somebody believe the Lord praise the Lord and when you say Amen to the word you are helping the Holy Ghost brother bam said also the wrong Spirit communicates in the building they ask for help they start streaming you know when somebody is doubting or somebody mind is wondering that spirit will start moving from one place looking for another person that will agree with the doubt or agree with the wrong attitude and that Spirit has a support if it does not have a support it will find its way out amen but if it can just find a Channel of support is going to DW it praise the Lord amen and sometimes it stick on the person the person is in the service everybody is Happy the person is just miserable they're just moving their head they're just Hasting their teeth it's a spirit praise the Lord amen so uh uh I just want us to just like I said just let let's just take our hearts to the Lord tonight we have few prayer needs we want to pray for brother steenberg will be going to the hospital uh he should be admitted on Friday uh August 5th and then uh brother Jo Pasco with daughter one of

God thank you musicians that will be it for now God bless you Saints if you can be seated for just a moment praise the Lord God bless you Saints for coming it's good to see every one of you um sometimes um we we we take things for granted and um in a way we don't appreciate you know our coming together uh the Bible says we should not forsake the ging together of the Saints it's just heartwarming that when I am leaving home I can see on my mind's eye that this brother is going to be in church this sister is going to be in church so as I'm coming I have an expectation praise be to God so much so that when I come and I don't see you that would not stop me from enjoying my service that would not stop me from enjoying the Lord but I get so concerned what is it oh he's sick oh he's working um you know for sometimes uh we don't get any reason and uh praise be to God it's all well and good praise the lord we should count ourselves blessed praise the Lord um we are living in in in in in a very dangerous time in a desperate moment and desperate moments call for desperate measures life shouldn't just go on year in year out and you are always the same person that we are all Trav down the road and you are either at the same spot or you are backwards you have to pause and ask yourself what is going on what is going on those that I started with they are far going ahead and here I stand what is going on and if there is going to be any change you have to change never expect that you will go to bed and rise up the following morning and things have changed you want God to do something different you must also do something different you don't continue down the same path and you expect a change in your life I remember oh mine um praise God I'm going to say it now in one of the dreams I had one Once Upon a Time I Saw brother team in my dream and then he was so angry he just walked to me stood and looked at me like this and he didn't say anything and he turned back probably 20 years ago I'm not very sure and then he started going so I called him I said Pape you can't go like that then he stopped and 10 I said you can't go like that then he came back and he told me until you are ready God is not ready but when you are ready God is ready so it's the same message I want to pass tonight until you are ready God is not ready but when you are ready you can be rest assured that God is ready we are living in a desperate time I remember yesterday afternoon I was waiting on the Lord in the office I was SE behind the desk the computer desk and there is this um whatever partition they have made I was sitting behind it and a young man came in the office and he said I'm looking for Dan and we are three Dans and yesterday everybody was at work so I heard him but I was busy and then he said something else I didn't even catch it and then he asked somebody asked him which of the dance then he said the Christian so when he said that then I lifted up my head they said oh yeah you are here praise the Lord then he said I hear you are a pastor I said no I'm not a pastor I'm only a preacher there he said what is the difference then I had the opportunity to tell him what the difference was then he asked me is Al your last name I said yes were you a a Muslim I said yes and you are now a Christian I said yes he said you know I am a Muslim and I am a Christian I go to church on Sundays and I go to mosque on Fridays and in fact I could relate to his condition this is the life of a desperate Soul a young guy I think he's about 24 25 years old that is is so desperate for the truth that is at the crossroads that is looking for help and I was just wondering probably all the years I spent in general meals it was probably because of this soul and I told him I said probably you and I need to be talking he said yes I'll be glad to talk to you and this morning he came and asked for my number and I gave it to him and I was just wondering he doesn't know where he belongs so these are the two dominant religions so let me just hold on to the two so if the Christians are going and the Muslims don't go I go with them if the Muslims are going and the Christians don't go I go with them but then you would realize that if the Muslims were going and assuming just assuming the Christians were not going they will tell you that you know you were not fully committed so you are not going anywhere and when the Christians are going not if then it's just going to be you are not committed but praise be to God we know what the truth is we know where we stand we know what we have believed praise be to God without Christ life is completely empty what you think is life is death what you think is joy is sorrow without Christ you have no hope whatsoever Paul said for me to live is Christ and to die is gain and the way they call heresy that is the way we worship the god of our fathers there comes a time you have to call a halt do an introspection search your heart and see where you want to go what you want to do it's no longer there is no more time to play church when you look at the prophecies the Bible has given all all these years I mean there is nothing that is left it's homegoing time praise be to God it is homegoing time praise the Lord time is not our friend tonight praise the Lord and by the grace of God I just want us to look at something um a few things I have just put down here trusting the Lord that is going to be a blessing to us tonight um if we can please stand for the reading of the word turn to uh 1 Samuel 17 1st Samuel 17 um 32 1732 praise the Lord count yourself blessed praise God it doesn't matter whether we have the things of this life um God will supply all our needs according to his rightous and Glory so whatever the need be I mean if God should bless you with the wealth of this world and then you don't you don't you don't make it at the end of the day today what is the use of it Lord have mercy if I have to be poor and be riched in this life in order to serve God in sincerity and with all honesty I will do it and do it to the glory of God praise the Lord thank you Jesus uh 17:32 I read and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and F with this Philistine and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his Youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep okay let's drop to 37 and David said moreover the Lord have have delivered me out of the P of the lion and out of the P of the bear and he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go the Lord be with thee praise be to God praise be to God father may you add your blessings to the reading of your word tonight Lord we pray thee in Jesus name amen shall we be seated praise the Lord now when you read this story the children of Israel were at war against the Philistine the armies of Israel had encamped on one side of the Hill the mountain and on the other side side were the Philistines and for 40 days this human Mountain will just come down the hill and then just brag and brag and brag and brag and call the children of God names because he told them give me a man if I kill him you will serve us if he kills me we will save you but this was a man that was so strong huge a warrior and there was nobody in the camp of Israel among the generals that could face him and he would just come and brag and brag and brag and scream and the Bible says when he is coming down the children of Israel they they they flee that was how scary he was and Jesus sent David because his three brothers were there go see how your brothers are doing send this food to them and then bring me back a report and David went he got there whilst he was there speaking with some of them here comes Goliath Goliath again and then he started defying the army of the Lord of Israel and then David turned and looked at him they said what is going on they said oh this man this is what he has been doing for the past 40 days and there is no man in in the camp of Israel to fight him he is so so so strong he's been fighting war from his youth he is a warrior among Warriors the man is difficult he said no I would not stand and look at this man defy the army of the Lord and he said if somebody what would what would they do for somebody that would would would defeat this man would kill him they said oh the King has PR he going to make him Rich the King has promised he's going to give that man his daughter to marry and his house would be the the house of his father will be free and then he kept going and still asking what would the king do for any man that fights this man and kills him he kept getting the same message over and over until somebody went to saw there is a young here who thinks he can fight goath so what a young man he said call him over and here comes David and then he looks at David in that small body and he tells David you know you can't fight this man this man has been fighting since from his youth there is nobody in the the camp of Israel that can withand him you know sometimes in this life in your service to God you are going to get to a place where people are going to discourage you and they are not doing it with any bad intent this is SA a man of his stature and then he's seeing this small boy going against this man a man they have been running away from for 40 days he was only showing that parental concern it's not with any bad intent and this is where you have to encourage yourself it is not all the time somebody has to encourage you it's not all the time you have to encourage yourself you have to speak to Yourself Praise the Lord and this is where having an experience with God is very [Music] important praise the Lord because the trials of of today are preparing you for the battles of tomorrow and when he was done thinking David was going to say oh thank you I need to go back thank you for saving my life David said no I am going to fight him seeing he has defiled the army of the Lord praise the Lord he said you know I was taking care of my fathership in the wilderness the lion came and took one I killed it and delivered the Sheep a bear came I took it by the beard and I slew it and I can kill this man I can fight him then Saul realized that he was not just dealing with an ordinary citizen that this man had experienced something he never have heard of if I was a shepherd and a lion came and took one as a matter of fact I can if the lion could even hear me I would tell him if you can take more go ahead to save my skin to save my life I would never run after the lion and Saul realized that no this is something else he say you know what go the Lord be with you he said let not your heart fail because of this man and when he went before Saul when he went before when he went before Goliath Goliath looked at him with disdain who are you a little boy like you you are just a bad boy you didn't get a good training even the Army generals are running away you are coming I will kill you and and feed you to the Beast the Beast of the field I said no you telling Li is going to be the other way around you have defied the army of the Lord you are coming against me with your sword with your Spears and in the name of your Gods I come against you in the name of the Lord God of the army of Israel praise be to God now if God had opened Goliath's eyes the way he opened the eyes of the donkey Bam's donkey to see what he was going against he was going to run for his dear life he didn't know he was looking at that small David but beyond that praise be to God my goodness the host of the army of the Lord was right there ready for action it was like Elijah elishah elishah and his servant when he went out that early that morning and he saw that the armies of the syrians the enemies had encamped right about them he went in master we are in trouble the city has been encamped right about by the enemy and he prayed and asked God to open his eyes to see and when God open his eyes he saw that Chariots of Fire had encom about them ready for action and they were just waiting for the servant of God to give an instruction and that took all the fear away praise be to God we are not alone never think you are alone when the battle gets so tough when it gets so rough and you can feel that heat and you think is you are all alone You Think You Are by yourself that is the voice of the devil there is more with you than there is with them praise the Lord and now we know how the story ended praise the Lord now when you read down David actually took himself out of the equation it was the L Barrel as he said it was not David's Barrel it was the Lord's Barrel he only needed a vessel to use and David came right on time and he availed himself and God just stepped in him and used that vessel now David picked five stones in the message Witnesses 1953 045 e the prayer of God said watch he had five Stones j s u s Jesus wrapped up in five fingers f a i t h faith brother he got the thing working right around and around and around and when you get Faith in Jesus Christ work it in a perpetual motion huj in your soul something is going to take place praise the Lord sin and sickness will get away from you Devils will scatter like Roaches on the floor in summertime when the light is turned on praise the Lord prise the Lord when you have that in your soul faith in Christ Jesus in a perpetual motion not on and off not on and off but in a perpetual motion praise be to God Mar that in the message on certain sound 1961 0415 e brother Bram said watch what he done he picked up five Stones the number of Grace j s u s Jesus put in his hand f a i t h faith faith in Jesus here here comes here he comes he knowed what he was talking about he was certain it was God he was certain no uncertainty about that praise be to God David said let not your heart fail because of him I am here tonight to re-echo these words let not your heart fail because of him because of who because of the devil let not your heart fail because of him now the devil was defeated in heaven the battle we are fighting today it was the Battle of angels not the Battle of men that war started in heaven and the devil was defeated then he was Lucifer at the time and then he was cast down now this is where we have to watch The Devil sweet talked to tears of the angels in heaven to go to war against God and when he came to the the garden again he did the same thing to Eve sweet talked her and before she realized what was going on it was over that is why we are not called to rason never try to reason with the devil he will rason you out a man that was able to deceive angels to go to war against God and you think you can reason with him he has been in the game longer than any man would ever be so you don't ever Rasen with the devil we are called to express our faith that you get to a place though you don't understand you believe it because it is the word of God you don't know what is going on you check your life and everything is good you are doing the best you can for the kingdom of God and yet still things are not what they are supposed to be you don't reason that out you don't reason that out let your faith in God be certain there is no uncertainty about this today I I am a child of God tomorrow something happens no I am not saved I'm no longer a child of God no children of God are born children of God there is no way a sheep would ever die a goat if you are a sheep you will die a sheep praise the Lord let your faith EX press faith in the word of God not only when it seems convenient praise the Lord now when the fall took place and God came down he pronounced judgment on Eve for Adam he cast the ground and now when he got to the serpent he said because you have done this on thy belly you would go and dust you would eat all the days of your life and he said Genesis 3:15 I am going to put an emity between you and the woman and between the woman's seed and thy seed and he shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel praise the Lord praise the Lord now Christ was the seed of the woman that Bru the serpent said it was him then and it's him now for no man can withand the devil now Romans 16:20 says and the God of Peace shall Bru Satan under your feet shortly praise the Lord so it is not you the God of Peace shall Bru Satan but under your feet it is not you it is God doing it through you for the prophet of God said that he has no hands but our hands he has no feet but our feet so he is going to use those feet to Bru the devil now in the message Christianity versus adolat 1961 1217 every sickness every every devil every Power even death itself is under your feet under your feet this is bringing bringing us to a place of Authority for you to know who you are and where you stand that you are not any common person yes the world may see you as a common person and we are are we not you may never be invited to the White House you may never even get to know the mayor of your city nobody may even take notice of you in the community where you live but when heaven looks down God knows that I have a son and I have a daughter here and guess what the angels of the Lord Encompass run about you by day and by night that when you move they move when you stand they stand when you sit the S when you are sleeping they are keeping watch over you praise be to God you are not just anybody know who you are that you are a son that you are a daughter of the almighty God that even death even death is under your feet now as Romans 16:20 says and the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet if the devil is sitting on top of your head it shows that Christ has not come if you are standing to to Toe with the devil in the ring it shows Christ has not come in yet but when Christ comes in remember the barrel is the Lord's barel it's not yours it's between God and Satan between right and wrong between just and unjust it is not your ble before we came into the picture men and women had already come and gone today is our turn to fight if Christ hares we will be gone tomorrow the younger generation will come and continue the fight but it is the same God and the same devil praise the Lord so if the devil is on your head or on your shoulder or on your neck it shows Christ has not come in yet because the Bible says in the Book of Romans and the God of Peace shall bruise the devil under your feet the word has placed him there he has no choice it is not your strength it is not your doing the word of God that says Let There Be and there was that word has placed the devil under your feet thank and the devil knows better that when God comes in the devil takes his place under your feet thank when God comes in when that word has become flesh in you the devil knows better where to go you don't have to instruct him why because the word has placed him there that's right there is so much power that's right in the word of God there is so much Authority in the word of God that when you put that word on your lips and you speak it it's as good as de speaking it praise the Lord oh what a mighty God we serve so it is not you God bless you sis Nicole good to see you amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord now so you realize that the barel is not our Barrel it is the Lord's barrel and the only reason the devil will come under your feet is because Christ has coming so the question is never the question is never whether the devil knows where to go or not the question is not whether the devil knows who he is or not that is not in doubt the question is do you know who you are do you know what Authority you have do you know what power you have that sometimes we sit down and we are engulfed with problems that problems take over our lives and we sit down and we cry and we Mur And We complain as if we don't have a God praise the Lord but always remember that you are a son and a daughter of the Living God in whose hands there is power that you can change your circumstances you don't have to accept anything or everything that comes to you when situations come speak to them when sicknesses come place them where they belong when the devil shows up let him know where he belongs thank you praise the Lord let not your heart fail because of him the devil is under your feet and now there is an ongoing barel because God the word of God has placed him under your feet what do you have to do just walk over him just Place him on where he belongs walk over him just like shut up now if you are walking and the devil is under your feet have no mercy on the devil the devil is not a friend he's an enemy just like the like the that went to church and they were singing Brun Brun it means I step on Satan I step on Satan and he was singing I step on Satan I step on Satan sitting in his wheelchair and then he goes to bed and then he gets a dream the devil shows up you in church when they were singing I step on Satan I step on Satan you are also singing I step on Satan I step on Satan with what legs you don't have legs with what legs were you stepping on Satan now you would think the was going to say oh I'm sorry it was just a song everybody was singing and I was also singing I didn't mean it no that was not that he said I was not stepping on you with my legs I was stepping on you with the legs of Christ praise the Lord and the devil just jumped he said yeah if you joke I will do it again he said no I just came to find out he said no I stop on you in the name of Jesus and the devil just fled praise the Lord know who you are know where you stand don't take any foolishness from the Devil we cannot fear God and fear Satan at the same time how can you a child of God my goodness my goodness praise be to God oh mine the devil doesn't belong anywhere but under your feet praise the Lord now it's interesting as I was looking at this subject something came up okay I don't know do we have enough time I'm not sure praise the Lord so now as I was looking at this something came up that when you look at the feet of a man okay you look at the feet you have the toes you have the soul of the feet um and then you have the heels now the Bible is very specific the word of God says and he will bruise your head and you will bruise his heels and now when you look at it the heel we all know where the heel is the back part of the leg and then it just struck me it just struck me that when the devil bruises your heel what he is doing he is keeping you on your toes for God praise the Lord he keeps you on your toes he puts you in a fighting mode the best boxer this world has ever known was Muhammad Ali and in the ring I have seen him on his toes just dangling from one side to the other all through the 12 rounds he is on his toes fighting and you can be on your toes you can stand you can walk on your toes praise the Lord but I wonder how many people can do this on their on their heels no you can't so when the devil bres your heels when he is at his worst he brings the best out of you he puts you on your toes in a fighting mode for God that you put the devil where he belongs praise the Lord hallelujah now it also calls for caution it also calls for caution because the the Bible has placed him under our feet and is he there sleeping no he is there to fight the Devil is a fighter so and if a man is Fallen he is either sleeping or he will just slide as we seea a lot of times uh in snow or he will stumble there is something in the way he stumbles and he falls so when the devil is under your feet and you know the devil is under your feet it is not time to be Reckless it is time to be careful it is time to be cautious it calls for diligence in your work that you are careful how you walk you are careful where you go you are careful where you stand you want to be sure and very sure that every step you take you are being careful the steps of the Lord the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord the Bible says Thy word is a J onto my feet and a light onto my path the only thing that can keep you away from trouble is the word if you stay with the word there is no way you can ever get into error there is absolutely no way the reason why we get into error the reason why we get into trouble is because we set the word aside but if you stay with the word and the word takes a hold of your life my goodness there is absolutely no way you can ever get into error because it is the word that is keeping you praise the Lord and the worst the worst that can ever happen to you is to fall the worst that can ever happen to a child of God is for the devil to cause you to fall now what happens that even when you have fallen the Bible says a just man shall fall seven times and Rise Again seven times and rise again if you fall it's a child of God that has fallen you don't have to stay there you can catch a sheep and put the ship in Muddy Waters the ship would never keep quiet it will shout and shout and shout and shout and tell the shepherd I am here I need help he doesn't stay there because it is not in the sheep's DNA to stay in an environment like that so when a child of God when you fall is a child of God that has fallen you have not become a devil and the the just shall fall seven times and rise again and even the Bible says even where your heart condemns you know that God is greater than your heart and knows all things so you have no excuse praise the Lord let not your heart let not your heart fail because of him now there is so much power in the word of God just cultivate that habit if you are not doing it do not let a day pass by without you having to take the Bible sit down and have a true communion with God do not let don't let a day pass by without you having to just sit down take a tape a message and listen to it feed your soul the devil knows how much power there is in the word of God and if there is anything he can do to take you away from the word he will do it that is why you'll be lying down all day you don't have any plans to do anything but as soon as you take your bible to read that is when you think of the beggars in the fridge oh I'm hungry oh let me put it down it's just the devil because the devil knows where your anchor is he knows what your Fortress is he knows what your stronghold is if he can only get you away from it that is enough for him when he sent the 70 disciples the Bible says he sent them in PE to go and heal the sick and cast out devils and they went and they healed all manner of sickness and diseases and they cast out demons and when they came back they were rejoicing and shouting and Jesus told them that when you guys were there I saw Satan fall like lightning from the heavens praise be to God and lot of the times we do not know what goes on when we get on our knees I pray God to open our eyes so we can just see a glimpse of what happens when we go on our knees that heaven hears us when we pray they didn't know that the devil was falling from the from the heavens like light they didn't know praise be to God when you pray something happens every time you pray something happens you may not see it in a day you may not see it in a week you may not see it in a month you may not even see it in your lifetime you may be dead and gone praise be to God my goodness that prayer would be answered and they came rejoicing and Jesus told them don't only Rejoice because of this but also Rejoice that your name is written in the L's book praise the lord we are an invincible army of the Lord we are we cannot be defeated all that the father have given me they will come brother Bram said if you are too stubborn and you a child of God if it will cause God to to just take you home he will do it and save your soul but God is not going to lose even one one we are an invincible Army you must say I've been having a lot of problems I've been having a lot of difficulties oh my life is just full of ups and downs oh sometimes so what does it change the picture what shows that we are an invincible Army is that sometimes the devil would actually get you get under your skin that you you feel that you are torn apart you are broken you feel that your life is St upside down you feel that things are not adding up and the devil brings you to a place to say that oh I have gotten him or I have gotten her they are never going to go back again oh I've succeeded and then you can't wait for the next service that when the church doors are open you are there that you may be on your knees you may be struggling oh you may cry all night pray all night your heart is sore and then you just wash your face and then you put some cream on your face just to look presentable you come nobody knows what you are going through until sometimes you have to put in a prayer request or maybe confide in somebody and then the devil looks at you but I thought I was done with this person I thought I was they were finished God is using you to confound the enemy he has used all his tricks he has used all his tactics he has used all the techniques all the strategies and he has nothing more to use and you are just going on going on that sometimes you can just cry and cry and cry pray pray pray pray that you can stand lift lift your hands up and praise the Lord with tears running down and the devil is wondering oh I thought I had this person it's because you cannot be defeated there is no place for failure and when I say there is no place of failure I am not mean saying this to mean that if you have failed there is no place for you that is not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that if even you decide I want to fail You Can't Fail You Can't Fail You Can't Fail there is no place for it we are an invincible army of the Lord It's 9:05 praise the Lord God is so so honored God is honored when he sees a child of God he sees his child taking the word and living by it it's an honorable thing to God just step down when a child is being obedient to a parent it brings Joy to the parents and much the same way when God sees that his son his daughter has taken his word with all the struggles with all the difficulties with all the problems they have to go through with all the ups and the Downs they are going through and they are doing their best living the best they know praise be to God God is honored in that that was why God was very very displeased with the children of Israel when they got to cadesh B God had given them the land Moses takes 12 people to go and spy the land and when they come back 10 have an evil report to give they were not looking at the promise of God they were looking at the Giants God was expecting them to act like David did David was not looking at the size of Goliath praise be to God his faith was Anchored In God they were looking at those people said no these are giants we are not able to take the land and God was displeased with them how many people have been to the Sea before I know we are living in Minnesota those born and Bre in Minnesota if you have not gone out maybe the biggest you have seen is Mississippi now when you go to the seashore and you stand at the shore and you look at the waves those towering waves just coming sometimes 5 10 15 20 30 ft high and they are coming with full force and you will take think that they are coming to engulf the land to take over the Earth and what do they do they just come with all that speed and they diminish they diminish if you were standing at the shore they will just diminish those Mountain waves towering waves will just diminish under your feet praise the Lord now God God has set a bound the word of God is true the word of God is sure there is no way you will take the word of God and ever be put to shame now those Mountain towering waves when they are coming I believe sometimes they say to themselves Once Upon a Time We occupied all this Earth we have been here for too long let's go back and maybe they are coming with the intention of going to take the land but as soon as they get to the boundary they get checked they say oh no the creator has set a boundary here we can't go past this and they respect that boundary they never go past it they respect that boundary and that is what happens when the devil is coming against you like those Mountain waves if you can only stand still you will see the glory of God because he knows his place a lot of the times we do not know but he knows his place so when he's coming with full force he just comes and he will diminish under your feet because that is where the word has placed him the word says a th000 shall fall at their side and 10,000 at the right hand side and None Shall come near thee that is the word that is the promise of God they will not come near Thee the devil oppress with fear if he can just get you to get frightened oh I'm in trouble oh waves oh the devil is coming he has gotten you but if you can just find a promise and just stand and call God's attention my goodness you are going to see the power of God Unleashed in your life in the way you never expected praise the Lord do not fear the devil do not fear the devil he is under your feet I want you to live here today knowing that the devil is under your feet that that person you thought you I mean you were in the ring to to together is no more he has been defeated let not your heart fail because of him the word has defeated him just take the word in all you have to do God needs those legs he needs those legs praise the Lord praise God uh is 912 it's 9:12 so I'll be winding down um praise the Lord um yes I want to see where to scale down oh praise the Lord okay so and I want to encourage ourselves tonight is that God has made a promise that he's going to have a bride without Sport and without wrinkle it doesn't matter where you have been it doesn't matter what you have done it doesn't matter how many times you have fallen it doesn't matter what you are going through if you can only accept Christ as your personal Lord and Savior if you can only truly accept him and apply the token there is enough Power in the Blood to wipe you and wipe every sin wipe every iniquity wipe every transgression and keep you so clean that when God looks down he doesn't see your mistakes he doesn't see your sin all he sees is the blood the blood wipes so clean it leaves no spot brother brother somewhere said that when you are a son of God a child I'm not quoting in ver but a Son of God or a child of God a daughter of God that has been redeemed you see a baby a baby that is born today you see how innocent they are but the brother said when you are born again you are more innocent than that baby the blood will just puredge you and cleanse you and wash you so clean that when God looks down he doesn't see them whatever you did he doesn't see it he has promised that he will have a bride and it is the promise he has made and God is going to keep his word it is not for you to worry about it whether you are a child of God am I a child of God am I not you give yourself reasons today I am tomorrow I am not no just live by the word just keep enjoying the Lord just keep walking according to the word enjoy the Lord serve God the best you know and leave the rest for God you don't have to worry you don't have to worry you don't have to worry just trust the Lord believe in his word take the word at heart treasure the word treasure the word Heaven and Earth shall pass away but the word of God the the prophet of God said one J of his word would never pass away in the beginning was the word the Word was God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt amongst men God wants to see his word becoming flesh in you the word of God taking on flesh in you that you can look back and you can see from the time God took you took took a hold of your life and you can tell that I am not the man I used to be anymore I am not that the sister the that the woman I used to be anymore I am Mrs Jesus Christ that you know you know and you know that when you are taking your last breath praise be to God that Christ will be on the other side of the aisle waiting to welcome you home well done a good and a faithful servant it's all God doing it it is not your strength your strength would never do it praise be to God the barel is the Lord's barel I'm finding it difficult I'm I'm just looking for a place to close praise the Lord one writer one time said that cows die many times before their death God doesn't want to deal with cows God wants brave men and women courageous men and women that when the fire is being set and they are telling you to renounce Christ as we are going to put you there you will defy that you'll be ready to go because you know whom you have believed if God has not taken a hold of your life when you see that you run away that when you get to that point it's no longer you it's no longer you it's Christ in you the hope of glory praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah God doesn't want cowards the word of God would never suffer defeat he has conquered sickness he has conquered death he has conquered the grave let not your heart fail because of him the devil has been defeated he has no rule over your life God has cast a hedge around you praise be to God oh my goodness the devil cannot trespass because you are God's Property the devil knows his boundary he knows his boundary God has cast a head around you praise the Lord every day we live is an opportunity um you know to get right with God an opportunity a glorious opportunity to get right with God ask yourself this life I have been living all these years has it changed me it has either made you worse or you are the same place that is if you are not living by the word but today if you are hearing the voice of God it is an opportunity to get right with God there is always wrong in his arms of love God would never turn back any child of his that you get to a place and you realize I have made a mistake I have messed up have mercy upon my soul you come bading the blood there is absolutely no way God will turn his back on you we talk about the love of God we barely Scrat the surface of Go I mean the love of God we barely scratch the surface As we sing that song that is so white you can't go around it the love of God is so high you can't go above it it's so low you can't go beneath it and as the songwriter says what is it praise the Lord that if every man was a scribed by tray and if every plant on Earth were a quill and the sea or the ocean ink and the skies parchment if we all set out to write the love of God we are going to drain the ocean dry who can understand the love of God therefore God so loved the world you and me that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life that God looked on his only begotten son in whom he was well placed to dwell and they bruised him tortured him killed him for you and me if you turn him down today tomorrow do you think you turn a chance the answer is simply no praise be to God is difficult I keep applying my brakes and I keep sliding praise the Lord oh praise God so tonight I want you to know that the devil's quiver is empty you all know what the quiver is that is why you put your arrows the devil has no arrows to shoot his quiver is empty the Bible says that he goes around roaring like a lion as a roaring lion he is a toothless Bulldog praise the Lord he can back and back and back he can't bite he has not tooth Christ took the teeth out praise the lord we are serving a great God and the Lord our God is alive the Lord our God is Not death the devil has been defeated the musicians can come over to show that I'm actually bringing the cutting down praise the Lord Christ has overcome death hell and the grave and he sealed the promise that Easter morning when he rose from the dead he disarmed the devil arrested him and has kept him in Chains praise God he broke the shackles of death and has severed that arm of the devil that arm of the enemy that once upon a time took a hold of that of your life he has SED that arm that arm has no control over your life anymore you are no longer a slave to the devil you are a son of God you are a daughter of God praise the Lord thank you Jesus the devil is under your feet I just came to remind you what the word of God says the devil is under your feet do not give him any chance God wants you to take your place as a son as a daughter with that Authority God has vested in you so much power and so much Authority that there is no way the devil can hinder you no how can the devil hinder you when you do anything wrong when you go out of your way to do something it's you doing it the devil can never compel you he will suggest to you he will suggest you the devil can never compel you out of your own last you can do anything you want to do but we are a free people today there is Liberty in the house of God and we are that house there is freedom praise be to God it's 9:25 brother one can you please come over and uh praise the Lord God bless you
