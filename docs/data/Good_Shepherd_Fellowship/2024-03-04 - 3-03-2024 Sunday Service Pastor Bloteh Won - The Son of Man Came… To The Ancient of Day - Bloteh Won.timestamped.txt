[49:51] Fulfillment praise the Lord think about
[49:55] this
[49:56] you just think about
[49:58] this uh
[50:01] signs have a BCE so much that when you
[50:06] are walking on the street you have to be
[50:09] careful somebody could be taking your
[50:10] picture and putting it up but you just
[50:13] think about this what would have
[50:17] happened if the news media could have
[50:21] caught the scene of of the angel Gabriel
[50:26] visiting Mary at the
[50:29] well praise the
[50:31] Lord if you if you if you if you realize
[50:34] there you will see that the same angel
[50:37] that spoke to
[50:39] Zacharias you just think about this now
[50:42] the angel appeared to Zacharias in the
[50:44] temple and told Zacharias that he will
[50:47] have a
[50:49] child now Zacharias could have gone out
[50:53] there and tell the people I met an angel
[50:55] some will believe him by the record of
[50:58] his character and some will not believe
[51:03] him praise the Lord you you saw an angel
[51:07] you praise the Lord by the matter of
[51:10] fact you owing me some money you have
[51:11] not PID me then you telling me you saw
[51:13] an
[51:16] angel True Praise the Lord but Zacharias
[51:19] got into a condition
[51:22] where he even uh uh uh surprised him he
[51:27] was he was he was in a doubtful
[51:29] condition so the angel put him in a
[51:32] state and that state that Zacharias will
[51:35] be in will be a Vindication the angel
[51:40] says because you don't believe me you
[51:41] are not going to talk until the child is
[51:46] born now Zachariah comes home he came
[51:49] talk to his wife his wife gets concerned
[51:54] she called the relative Zacharias can't
[51:56] talk he just have to
[51:58] write praise the Lord amen but when the
[52:02] child is born at the naming ceremony of
[52:05] the child Zachariah got his speaking and
[52:10] he says the angel said the child will be
[52:12] called
[52:13] John right in that moment for the fact
[52:17] that El Elizabeth God
[52:20] conceive praise the
[52:23] Lord at her age
[52:26] the testimony of Zacharias is
[52:32] confirmed and right at that moment
[52:35] Zachariah
[52:36] speaking and it's the same
[52:40] Angel but if God who have
[52:44] allowed the the the news media in that
[52:48] day to have captur in your Gabriel Mary
[52:52] will be out of the picture every new
[52:55] news media will want to make money of
[52:57] inel
[52:58] Gabriel they will explore the I mean
[53:01] explore the
[53:02] story they will say things that the
[53:05] angel never said but who would believe
[53:07] this this little girl who would believe
[53:12] her that even he had to take God to
[53:17] send the same Angel gave Joseph a
[53:23] dream and said don't put Merit
[53:29] away and these things are not feeble

[1:07:22] 7
[1:07:35] Daniel chapter 7 we realize there are
[1:07:39] the
[1:07:41] uh like I said
[1:07:44] earlier it's writing Daniel chapter 7
[1:07:48] you will
[1:07:49] find the the attribute of uh uh
[1:07:54] Asian of day
[1:07:57] use praise the

[1:08:09] theologians commented much on the Asian
[1:08:12] of day much that is said about the Asian
[1:08:15] of day is just explaining the title you
[1:08:19] know that uh uh he's the Asian of
[1:08:22] day praise the Lord when they get it up
[1:08:25] it will come
[1:08:26] up now uh uh you know that uh asan of
[1:08:30] death is the one before time the one
[1:08:34] before time in season you know trying to
[1:08:37] bring lot of understanding to the word
[1:08:41] Asian of
[1:08:43] day okay I snap my finger just now
[1:08:47] because I remember that U uh I left out
[1:08:52] where I took this phrase from we read
[1:08:54] this on uh Wednesday night the son of
[1:08:57] man came to the asan of day watch him
[1:09:00] blend these two together we read that
[1:09:03] from pmos Vision but I forgot to to put
[1:09:06] a slide there we have the code back
[1:09:08] there if you go back to the note from uh
[1:09:10] a Friday night but uh uh don't go back
[1:09:14] to it let let's just stay with this I
[1:09:16] will just read it and then if you want
[1:09:18] to go and make a search on it uh we we
[1:09:21] will we can give you what you need so so
[1:09:24] but the Book of Daniel just like the
[1:09:27] Book of Revelation what I want for us to
[1:09:30] understand is that U sometimes you get
[1:09:34] to the place where you you feel a little
[1:09:37] bit uh uh afraid and says uh you know is
[1:09:40] are the people really understanding uh
[1:09:43] you know what what you are bringing to
[1:09:44] them is it something but it's the word
[1:09:46] of God Amen is the word of the Lord
[1:09:50] praise the Lord and uh uh uh but as we
[1:09:54] have been saying the Book of Daniel The
[1:09:58] Book of Daniel what I want you to catch
[1:10:01] tonight I mean this this uh morning The
[1:10:04] Book of Daniel holds the mystery of the
[1:10:09] Jewish
[1:10:11] Redemption praise the Lord the reason
[1:10:15] why God gave Daniel this Vision the
[1:10:19] Sevenfold
[1:10:21] purpose it was all about the
[1:10:24] Redemption of
[1:10:26] Israel praise the Lord amen the
[1:10:30] Redemption of Israel if we want to go
[1:10:32] back you will remember that uh H uh uh
[1:10:37] Joseph just being the young boy he was
[1:10:40] he was a teenager because he was 17
[1:10:43] years old when he was taken to Egypt so
[1:10:46] before that time
[1:10:49] Joseph was having
[1:10:51] dreams toward them is recorded when he
[1:10:55] dreamed the first time his brothers
[1:10:57] bowed before him they got angry with him
[1:11:00] when he told them that dream the second
[1:11:02] time Joseph would dream it was not only
[1:11:05] his brothers his mother and father also
[1:11:08] bow his father said so do you are you
[1:11:11] trying to say that your mom and this
[1:11:13] time is not only your brother's now your
[1:11:15] mom and your and M said we going to Bow
[1:11:18] before you praise the
[1:11:20] Lord but what did did not know was that
[1:11:25] that dream that Joseph had it was
[1:11:31] prophetic it was about the Jewish
[1:11:37] Redemption are we
[1:11:41] together that dream was prophetic so
[1:11:45] watch this now as as as we will want to
[1:11:48] look at that together watch this
[1:11:51] Joseph when he had the dream the first
[1:11:55] part of the dream will fulfill when
[1:11:59] Joseph was in Egypt when his brothers
[1:12:03] came amen are we together the second
[1:12:08] part of the dream the second dream with
[1:12:10] his father and mother now watch this now
[1:12:14] people that are trying to be very
[1:12:17] critical the second dream Joseph mother
[1:12:22] and father was supposed to Bow but R
[1:12:25] shall
[1:12:29] died she died without even binding down
[1:12:33] so are we going to call Joseph a false
[1:12:35] prophet one of the Dream came to
[1:12:41] pass but there was never a time where
[1:12:44] his mother and his father bowed down to
[1:12:47] him praise the Lord but you see these
[1:12:51] things they are not menade
[1:12:56] they are not himic fabricated I mean you
[1:12:59] you just you can't dream dream if God
[1:13:01] don't give it to you you won't have
[1:13:03] it praise the Lord and let me even tell
[1:13:06] you the fact you can't even interpret
[1:13:08] your
[1:13:09] dreams you can't interpret your
[1:13:14] dreams you can't interpret it you can
[1:13:16] only
[1:13:18] assume interpretation of dreams and
[1:13:21] prophecy belong to a prophet that's
[1:13:25] right I I was thinking about that in the
[1:13:28] week St uh St is the get the message St
[1:13:31] is the get brother Brandon had a dream
[1:13:33] and in that dream he's on the mountain
[1:13:37] with Jack Mo
[1:13:39] daughter a teenage girl he's on the
[1:13:42] mountain with Jack Mo and in the dream
[1:13:44] he's asking what what is happening what
[1:13:46] am I doing with this little girl on the
[1:13:50] mountain as if a a man and a woman is
[1:13:53] having having a date on the
[1:13:56] mountain he's he's thinking in his mind
[1:13:59] am I going to
[1:14:03] fall praise the Lord and it was just
[1:14:06] like a man and a woman you know running

[1:17:43] Bible is the Book of
[1:17:47] Life there is no there is not one even
[1:17:50] that is ever on this earth that is not
[1:17:53] not written in the
[1:17:54] scripture and I want to challenge you
[1:17:56] this morning to tell you that this
[1:18:00] Bible this Bible speaks more about the
[1:18:04] time we are living in than any time in
[1:18:08] history that's this Bible yes it speak
[1:18:11] more about this time that we are living
[1:18:13] in than any time in
[1:18:16] history you want to know what a
[1:18:18] political condition is check the
[1:18:21] scripture that's why Jesus told the
[1:18:23] people search the scripture for in them
[1:18:27] is the Word of Life yes sir not Google
[1:18:31] or YouTube search the
[1:18:40] scripture praise the Lord are we
[1:18:44] together amen am now so uh uh I'm I'm
[1:18:50] I'm just I'm trying I'm saying you know
[1:18:52] know trying making all of those emphasis
[1:18:54] just to get a hold of you this
[1:18:56] morning I don't want you to sleep on
[1:18:59] me now so if you look if we look here in
[1:19:03] our uh uh so we we are speaking on the
[1:19:06] Asian of day but we are taking the scene
[1:19:09] here I was going to read this is what I
[1:19:11] was going to use for my scripture
[1:19:13] reading uh uh St John chapter 5 22 for
[1:19:18] the father judgeth no man but have
[1:19:20] committed all judgment to the son praise
[1:19:24] the Lord a beautiful type of this can be
[1:19:27] seen in the in the life of uh uh David
[1:19:29] and
[1:19:30] Solomon when before uh David died he
[1:19:34] called Solomon and he start committing
[1:19:36] to Solomon you know uh remember shim he
[1:19:40] spit in my face you know what to do to
[1:19:42] him remember this one you know David
[1:19:46] just entrusted all judgment to the son
[1:19:49] praise the Lord so uh uh uh verse 23
[1:19:53] that all men should honor the son even
[1:19:55] as they honor the
[1:19:57] father he that honth not the son honth
[1:20:01] not the Father which sent him praise the
[1:20:06] Lord now we look at this word
[1:20:10] s when we in our uh in the beginning
[1:20:14] series that we've been talking about
[1:20:17] because if you don't if you don't put on
[1:20:20] your scriptural cap and you read he
[1:20:23] honor honoring his son your mind will go
[1:20:26] back to the son
[1:20:29] of in
[1:20:32] Nazareth praise the Lord
[1:20:36] amen we know that the son in the
[1:20:39] beginning was when God gave birth to
[1:20:43] himself when God left being
[1:20:48] inner because eternity and time can
[1:20:51] dwell together
[1:20:53] so the great internal God condensed
[1:20:57] himself to give a beginning in the
[1:21:00] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:21:03] God so the son year is the
[1:21:11] word praise the Lord the reason why it's
[1:21:15] important for us to understand that is
[1:21:17] because when we get back to Daniel and
[1:21:19] we start talking about the son of man
[1:21:21] coming to the of day you'll be able to
[1:21:25] understand
[1:21:27] it
[1:21:31] amen verily I said unto you he that
[1:21:35] heareth my
[1:21:36] word and Believe on him that sent
[1:21:40] me praise the Lord have everlasting life
[1:21:45] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:21:48] is pass from Death onto life now so this
[1:21:53] scripture right here if you look at the
[1:21:56] entire setting of the scripture the
[1:21:58] entire setting here is a judgment
[1:22:02] setting it's a judgment setting the
[1:22:05] father has committed all judgment to the
[1:22:09] son praise the Lord he has committed all
[1:22:12] judgment what is going to judge us the
[1:22:15] word is that now what uh uh uh uh Paul
[1:22:19] said over in Romans chapter 2 verse
[1:22:24] 16 Paul said you will be judged by Jesus
[1:22:28] Christ according to my
[1:22:34] gospel amen he says you be judged
[1:22:37] according to my gospel what such an
[1:22:40] authority who was
[1:22:45] he so we see a setting here we see we we
[1:22:49] see a judgment setting the father commit
[1:22:52] all judgment to the son and here Jesus
[1:22:57] said now if we honor the son if we honor
[1:23:00] the word take it in the sense of the
[1:23:02] word now like I said if you honor the
[1:23:04] word if you if the word have preeminence
[1:23:06] in your
[1:23:08] life praise the
[1:23:10] Lord you are meeting the purpose of the
[1:23:14] father because the purpose that the
[1:23:16] father send you here is for the
[1:23:20] word the purpose for us being here is
[1:23:24] for the word is for God's
[1:23:26] word to be manifest in our life that
[1:23:31] like Jesus would say let men see your
[1:23:33] good work and glorify your father that
[1:23:36] is in
[1:23:38] heaven praise the
[1:23:45] Lord what uh what an achievement it
[1:23:48] would be for the father to send us here
[1:23:50] just for us to live our life do anything
[1:23:52] that we want to do die and is
[1:23:55] finished then what is the purpose of his
[1:23:58] of he making
[1:24:00] man sure he had a purpose of expressing
[1:24:03] us sure he had a purpose of bringing us
[1:24:06] it's not just for us to just live our
[1:24:08] life anything and then we die to put our
[1:24:10] six feet on the earth and then is
[1:24:14] finished are we together now so you can
[1:24:18] see then that verse 24 now will help us
[1:24:21] to understand that Jesus is expressing
[1:24:24] that if you Hearth my word if you
[1:24:27] receive my word you believe on him that
[1:24:30] has sent me now believe on him that sent
[1:24:32] me you have everlasting life and you
[1:24:34] will not come into condemnation you have
[1:24:37] passed which mean as you are receiving
[1:24:40] the word if you are receiving the word
[1:24:42] that is given to you you are facing your
[1:24:44] judgment here this
[1:24:48] morning praise the Lord amen you are
[1:24:51] passed from death onto life which mean
[1:24:54] in this life if you use the word of God
[1:24:57] to judge yourself you are not going to
[1:25:00] face a judgment lay
[1:25:05] ahead are we together because what I'm
[1:25:08] going to talk about this morning is
[1:25:10] Judgment I'm going into judgment this
[1:25:13] morning not to make you afraid but just
[1:25:15] to allow us to be able to see the time
[1:25:18] that we are in the nations are not going
[1:25:21] to get better
[1:25:23] amen I will bring something to you right
[1:25:26] from the scripture and you're going to
[1:25:28] see clearly why these things are
[1:25:31] happening why the word is going in Jesus
[1:25:34] told the the the the disciple why he was
[1:25:37] here on Earth you know he told them
[1:25:39] because uh the Pharisees system the the
[1:25:42] sindr counsel because they re rejected
[1:25:45] him he told them what was going to
[1:25:47] happen to the people you will lack
[1:25:50] yourself in in the temple you will
[1:25:52] prayed and you will call on God but
[1:25:54] Titus the Roman general is going to
[1:25:56] surround the setting he going to run you
[1:25:59] over you will eat your children because
[1:26:02] the the thing about it there is that
[1:26:04] there is a penalty in rejecting God's
[1:26:08] word
[1:26:11] amen praise the Lord now the reason why
[1:26:15] H I'm I'm I'm making an emphasis for us
[1:26:17] to be able to get a good setting here is
[1:26:19] because when you talk about judgment
[1:26:23] everybody think about the white TR
[1:26:27] judgment praise the Lord look just like
[1:26:31] in in the system there is a lower court
[1:26:34] and there is a supreme
[1:26:36] court praise the Lord
[1:26:40] amen amen we receive judgment for things
[1:26:45] that we
[1:26:47] do but yet there is a Wier
[1:26:50] judgment the nation i s received
[1:26:54] judgment look at Egypt when they when
[1:26:57] they held God's people and they were
[1:26:59] enslaving God's people God brought
[1:27:01] judgment on on Egypt by sending them 10
[1:27:09] plagues praise the
[1:27:13] Lord are we
[1:27:16] together by sending them 10 plagues God
[1:27:19] brought judgment on
[1:27:21] Egypt
[1:27:23] it looks like it would have been good to
[1:27:26] bring it to the end but let's go to
[1:27:27] Romans chapter
[1:27:29] 1 sorry the team back there I didn't put
[1:27:33] that in the slide so uh you can either
[1:27:37] uh just go back and and project that for
[1:27:40] me let's just look at this together so
[1:27:43] so uh we can get a get a good setting
[1:27:46] here as we as we go
[1:27:51] on
[1:27:53] see what go uh Paul was telling the
[1:27:56] church here in
[1:28:01] Rome Romans chapter
[1:28:08] 1 let's read verse 16 that's one of the
[1:28:11] famous verse we all love it for I'm not
[1:28:14] ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it
[1:28:16] is the power of God unto salvation to
[1:28:19] everyone that believeth to the Jews
[1:28:21] first and to the the Greeks verse 17 for
[1:28:24] therein is the righteousness of God
[1:28:27] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[1:28:29] written the J shall live by faith now
[1:28:31] Verse 18 take this for the wrath of God
[1:28:35] which is
[1:28:36] Judgment the wrath of God now listen now
[1:28:39] Paul is saying the wrath of God is
[1:28:42] revealed from Heaven against all
[1:28:45] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[1:28:48] who hold the
[1:28:50] truth in unrighteousness
[1:28:54] now even bring it to
[1:28:57] ourself holding the truth of the
[1:29:02] word holding the truth knowing what the
[1:29:05] word
[1:29:08] ISS and with
[1:29:10] that you are entertaining
[1:29:14] unrighteousness in your body in your
[1:29:17] mind you are submitting yourself to
[1:29:20] judgment
[1:29:24] praise the Lord you are submitting
[1:29:27] yourself to
[1:29:29] judgment okay let's let's go ahead here
[1:29:31] a little
[1:29:32] bit that is the reason why h h h i mean
[1:29:36] we have the grace we sank about the seed
[1:29:39] of forgetfulness last night we have the
[1:29:41] grace we have the privilege that when we
[1:29:43] do wrong we have an advocate before the
[1:29:46] father we must confess our wrong place
[1:29:49] it under the blood and move on now in it
[1:29:52] not give our reason justify our why we
[1:29:55] must continue to do it right are we
[1:30:00] together because he says here that which
[1:30:03] may be known of God is manifested in
[1:30:06] them for God have shown it unto them for
[1:30:08] the invisible things of him from the
[1:30:11] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:30:14] being being Hors to by the things that
[1:30:16] are made even his internal power his
[1:30:20] godhead so that they without excuse
[1:30:23] because that when they knew God they
[1:30:25] glorify him not as God neither were
[1:30:28] thankful but became vain in their
[1:30:31] imagination and their Foolish Heart were
[1:30:33] dark in professing themselves to be wise
[1:30:36] they became fools they change the glory
[1:30:39] of The Incorruptible God into an image
[1:30:42] made like to corruptible men and and
[1:30:44] birds and and for the Beast and creeping
[1:30:47] things wherefore God now God wherefore
[1:30:52] God also gave them up to uncleanness
[1:30:56] through the lust of their own heart to
[1:30:59] dishonor their own body between themsel
[1:31:02] who change the truth of God to life
[1:31:04] worshiping and serving the creature more
[1:31:07] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[1:31:09] for this cause God gave them
[1:31:11] up into V A affections for even their
[1:31:17] women they change the natural use into
[1:31:20] that which is against nature and
[1:31:22] likewise also the men leaving the
[1:31:24] natural use of the women burning in
[1:31:26] their lust one towards another men with
[1:31:29] men working now I I'm reading all of
[1:31:32] this and where I want to bring you to is
[1:31:35] that everything that you are seeing
[1:31:37] around us amen everything you are seeing
[1:31:41] around us the the the the the the the
[1:31:45] the drugs
[1:31:47] movement amen the gun shooting the the
[1:31:51] the the the LGBT movement all of these
[1:31:55] things are
[1:31:57] judgment praise the Lord amen they are
[1:32:02] judgment when the word is
[1:32:04] rejected God leaves the people to
[1:32:10] thems praise the Lord
[1:32:13] amen you can never show me one happy
[1:32:16] life without
[1:32:20] God
[1:32:25] are we
[1:32:27] together so all of the things that we
[1:32:30] seeing around us with the Bible taken
[1:32:32] out of
[1:32:33] school biblical principle taken out of
[1:32:36] the Supreme Court and and all of those
[1:32:38] things that is
[1:32:42] happening praise the
[1:32:49] Lord God is supposed to
[1:32:52] order our
[1:32:55] effects he's supposed to order our
[1:33:01] effects are we
[1:33:05] together so as I as I bring this to you
[1:33:08] I'm I'm just trying to help you to see
[1:33:10] because you you talk about judgment we
[1:33:13] we we think about final judgment we
[1:33:16] don't think about the things that are
[1:33:17] happening around
[1:33:20] us
[1:33:22] amen look at when Peter said in the
[1:33:25] scripture 1 Peter chapter 4:7 he says
[1:33:28] judgment begin at the house of God what
[1:33:31] does that
[1:33:32] mean what it means is that the house of
[1:33:36] God is the house of correction that what
[1:33:38] it
[1:33:42] means how God brings judgment to us to
[1:33:45] correct us tell us that this thing you
[1:33:47] are doing is not right this is what I
[1:33:49] want you to do the house of God is the
[1:33:52] house of
[1:34:00] correction are we together okay so so we
[1:34:04] see you you you we we see this uh uh you
[1:34:07] know the the the setting here so uh uh I
[1:34:10] want to go into M uh if uh
[1:34:16] uh the thing back there can put my slide
[1:34:19] back up then we can start traveling
[1:34:22] together we have a little bit of uh uh
[1:34:25] reading that we want to do here now so
[1:34:27] let me let me take this don't don't
[1:34:29] change
[1:34:29] it let me just take it from uh uh the
[1:34:34] Friday note and and read it just just to
[1:34:38] be able to to get us on track now like I
[1:34:41] said the phrase down here wash him blend
[1:34:45] these two
[1:34:46] together it that's what grabed my
[1:34:48] attention on this on this entire subject
[1:34:52] of uh uh the son of man came to the
[1:34:55] Asian of
[1:34:56] day pmos Vision we read pmos Vision now
[1:35:01] Daniel 7 like I said just listen to me
[1:35:04] now don't don't expect it will not go up
[1:35:06] there I forget I didn't put in my in my
[1:35:08] slide here I beheld until the Thrones
[1:35:11] were cast down in the asent of day s
[1:35:13] whose Gard was white as snowed in his
[1:35:15] hair like wo that's Daniel 79 that we
[1:35:18] reading right there and we look in the
[1:35:20] reading here
[1:35:21] uh uh
[1:35:24] uh anybody knows that the old jorges
[1:35:27] Asian Jorge like like like uh English
[1:35:30] George used to wear it uh uh they wear a
[1:35:34] snow white wig how many remember that an
[1:35:38] Asian George wed a white we because and
[1:35:41] showing again that John over in the Lost
[1:35:44] day John on the Allen ofos he saw him as
[1:35:47] the George not a priest not a king not a
[1:35:50] prophet but a George
[1:35:52] the father St John 5:22 commit all
[1:35:55] judgment to the son now so that's what
[1:35:58] brother Bram is doing here he's trying
[1:35:59] to connect these events that are
[1:36:01] happening you know the father committing
[1:36:04] all judgment to the son keep that in the
[1:36:07] back part of your mind because we'll
[1:36:09] make emphasis on that he says here and
[1:36:12] he judg now come to judge the Nation Oh
[1:36:16] for that day when you see him like that
[1:36:20] his head was as white as snow Daniel saw
[1:36:23] him coming to the Asian of them watch
[1:36:27] him blend these two together come to the
[1:36:31] Asian of day whose hair was white as
[1:36:33] snow and John when John turned and
[1:36:35] looked he saw one like the son of man
[1:36:38] standing in the midst of the seven
[1:36:40] golden candles stick now so that's where
[1:36:43] we took this phrase wash him blend the
[1:36:47] two
[1:36:48] together praise the lord we read the
[1:36:51] scripture so these are the three three
[1:36:53] scriptures you will find the Asian of De
[1:36:57] mentioning we went over that on
[1:36:58] Wednesday night verse 9 Daniel chapter 7
[1:37:02] I beheld till the Thrones were cast down
[1:37:05] now watch that and the Asian of
[1:37:08] day asent of days they s whose garment
[1:37:12] was white as snow and his head as as as
[1:37:16] uh and the head of his head as a pure
[1:37:20] World his
[1:37:21] was like a fair flame and his wheel as
[1:37:24] Burning Flame now verse 13 I saw in a
[1:37:28] night vision and behold one like the son
[1:37:32] of man
[1:37:34] came with the Clouds Of Heaven just like
[1:37:39] Acts chapter one we read and came to the
[1:37:42] asan of day and they brought him near
[1:37:47] before him then the tail one until the
[1:37:50] Asian of day came and and judgment was
[1:37:52] given to the Saints of the most high and
[1:37:55] the time came that the Saints possess
[1:37:59] the kingom so now all of these three
[1:38:02] verses there are events that are around
[1:38:05] them and just like I
[1:38:08] said these are
[1:38:10] Visions just like when you have your
[1:38:12] dreams your dreams sometimes don't go in
[1:38:15] a direct sequence praise the Lord
[1:38:19] amen is oh I I was I was I was dreaming
[1:38:24] you know we were we were we were in
[1:38:26] California when I look I found myself
[1:38:28] back in

[1:38:31] Lord you are living in Minneapolis the
[1:38:34] dream supposed to start from Minneapolis
[1:38:36] before you go to California that's the
[1:38:39] normal
[1:38:40] way you see but it's it does not happen
[1:38:43] like that so that is the same way yet
[1:38:46] when you look at these and you really
[1:38:48] want to put them into scriptural
[1:38:50] sequence order verse 13 will happen
[1:38:53] before verse 9 I'll show it to
[1:38:58] you praise the
[1:39:01] Lord in the real sequence order verse 13
[1:39:06] will happen before verse 9 and then
[1:39:08] verse
[1:39:09] 22 where the sins possess the kingdom
[1:39:13] it's speaking about the Millennium right
[1:39:18] right are we together
[1:39:22] now this this is just watch this now
[1:39:26] that's verse n uh uh verse 9 this is
[1:39:29] verse 9 I beheld the truns were cast
[1:39:32] that's verse
[1:39:33] n and I beheld the TRS were cast that's
[1:39:37] all the Gentile Kingdom over now this is
[1:39:40] from the 10 virgin message he's
[1:39:43] interpreting what this means the the
[1:39:45] trone were cast Daniel say I beheld and
[1:39:47] the trone were cast brother bam saying
[1:39:50] is the ending of the Gentile Kingdom

[1:40:03] House who over there in Russia or North
[1:40:06] Korea all of their power is finished the
[1:40:09] Thrones are cast down man ruling is
[1:40:13] over now see what he was says here in
[1:40:16] Revelation chapter 4 Series he said now
[1:40:19] watch Daniel when he saw the throne at
[1:40:22] the Judgment they were
[1:40:26] empty okay why because man ruling is

[1:43:05] where that was what H uh uh sorry I
[1:43:08] won't use my finger when I supposed to
[1:43:09] use the
[1:43:11] laser the TR were cast down that was
[1:43:14] what Daniel
[1:43:16] saw
[1:43:18] amen the asan of their death SE that was
[1:43:21] what John
[1:43:25] saw are we
[1:43:29] together are you seeing the
[1:43:33] picture Daniel saw the the The Throne
[1:43:37] being cast down the end of the Gentile
[1:43:40] Kingdom and in his vision he saw the
[1:43:43] Asian of day
[1:43:45] sitting but John now will bring
[1:43:49] us that understanding in Revelation
[1:43:52] chapter
[1:43:54] 4 with one upon the
[1:43:59] throne and the 24
[1:44:02] others are we
[1:44:08] together praise the
[1:44:16] Lord but if you read if you if you look

[1:44:26] are we together have I lost you are you
[1:44:30] staying with me am I making you to think

[1:44:51] the Lord amen now if you read Daniel
[1:44:55] chapter
[1:44:57] 7:9 and you go down to verse 10 he says
[1:45:01] a fairy stream of issue came forth from
[1:45:04] before him thousand, Minister unto him
[1:45:08] and tens of thousand stood before him
[1:45:11] and the Judgment was set and the books
[1:45:14] were open
[1:45:17] now you will realize that you go over in
[1:45:20] the book of Jude you will see there in
[1:45:24] verse 14 and verse 15 Jude is telling us
[1:45:29] that Enoch in his
[1:45:33] days he had a
[1:45:36] vision where he saw the Lord coming with
[1:45:40] 10,000 the very same thing that Daniel
[1:45:42] is
[1:45:45] seeing are we
[1:45:49] together
[1:45:55] I don't want to lust you I don't I mean

[1:45:59] is just so much we can take the people
[1:46:02] get lost in the midst of all of the
[1:46:05] Earth but what I want to establish here
[1:46:08] is that this this this uh this coming
[1:46:11] forth of
[1:46:13] judgment this setting of judgment even
[1:46:18] Enoch before the to delivering
[1:46:21] destruction heart of vision of the Lord
[1:46:24] coming with 10,000 of his sins that is
[1:46:26] the very same expression that Daniel is
[1:46:29] using a setting forth of
[1:46:34] judgment are we
[1:46:38] together are we
[1:46:45] together praise the
[1:46:49] Lord

[1:51:52] mountain in in Tucson three great blasts
[1:51:55] and it says what was that mean what does
[1:51:57] that mean he said it was three words
[1:52:00] that he spoke praise the Lord
[1:52:04] amen the man only heard the
[1:52:07] blast I understood what it said it said
[1:52:11] judgment
[1:52:13] striking West
[1:52:14] Coast praise the Lord amen you go right
[1:52:19] in John chapter 12 you see the same
[1:52:22] thing Jesus was there there was a tunder
[1:52:25] that Rod there in the heaven the people
[1:52:28] said what is the tuner all
[1:52:30] about they only hear the tuner they
[1:52:33] never heard the voice when God spoke to
[1:52:36] Moses on the mountain the people said it
[1:52:40] thundered but Moses heard the
[1:52:45] voice are we together praise the Lord
[1:52:54] two days after
[1:52:56] Alaska like to have
[1:53:00] sunk it begin tuning around earthquake
[1:53:05] everywhere just look look at them every
[1:53:08] day earthquake just shaking
[1:53:11] everywhere praise the Lord this was in
[1:53:15] Alaska two day after that blast in ton
[1:53:18] Alaska had an
[1:53:20] earthquake why because the message in
[1:53:23] the blast is that
[1:53:25] judgment striking the West
[1:53:31] Coast praise the Lord what is the west
[1:53:34] coast is not only H uh uh uh as you want
[1:53:38] to look at it California we are on the
[1:53:41] west coast because the gospel is
[1:53:43] supposed to go back to the east
[1:53:46] right so judgment striking the West
[1:53:49] Coast it has to do with the Gentile
[1:53:52] Nations
[1:53:55] right are we together
[1:53:57] amen I'm trying to build this picture so
[1:54:01] I won't leave you with
[1:54:04] confusion and then two days after Alaska
[1:54:08] had an
[1:54:09] earthquake then look at this other
[1:54:11] statement down here now he says I was
[1:54:13] preaching in Los
[1:54:17] Angeles at the bill Mount Auditorium
[1:54:20] and I was
[1:54:22] speaking on a man choosing himself a
[1:54:25] wife choosing of a bride that would be
[1:54:28] the the message he was preaching amen
[1:54:32] when uh uh uh uh demon shakaron mother
[1:54:37] was
[1:54:39] sick praise the Lord there's a whole
[1:54:42] story there time for that and while in
[1:54:46] there something struck me and I didn't
[1:54:48] know nothing
[1:54:50] uh uh for about 30 minutes there was a
[1:54:53] prophecy that went out the first thing I
[1:54:55] remember brother musle and B I was out
[1:54:59] on the street walking around and it said
[1:55:02] thou
[1:55:04] capani which call yourself by the name
[1:55:08] of angels that's Los Angeles City of
[1:55:12] Angels see the Angels which are exalted
[1:55:16] in heaven will be brought down to Hell
[1:55:20] for if the mighty Works have been done
[1:55:25] in Sodom that has been done in you it
[1:55:28] who have been standing till this
[1:55:31] day and that was all unconsciously to
[1:55:37] me and when I understood that I when I
[1:55:41] said there is a scripture that is about
[1:55:44] that that is somewhere and and and I
[1:55:46] went and I found it where Jesus rebuked
[1:55:50] Capia now so it it was a scripture that
[1:55:52] was playing in his mind he standing
[1:55:55] right there in in in Los Angeles
[1:55:57] bringing bringing a prophecy but in the
[1:55:59] back part of his mind that prophecy is
[1:56:02] being compared to a scripture in the
[1:56:04] Bible because Jesus did the same to the
[1:56:07] city of capano
[1:56:09] right are we
[1:56:12] together Jesus rebuking capania the
[1:56:16] sea that night I look up the scripture
[1:56:19] come home got got uh the the history
[1:56:22] book and sod and gomor a striving City a
[1:56:26] gentile headquarter of the word in those
[1:56:28] days the time of lot you know that City
[1:56:31] by the HH by an earthquake sank into the
[1:56:36] deep
[1:56:37] sea there that sod and gomor they got an
[1:56:41] earthquake that sank them in Jesus time
[1:56:44] now cap also if Sodom will have worked
[1:56:48] if if sodon have had the work done in it
[1:56:52] that that you have done in you it will
[1:56:55] have been standing today but now you
[1:56:58] must be brought down to Hell what
[1:57:01] happened to Sodom it it it it went down
[1:57:04] in in the dead SE in Jesus's time when
[1:57:08] he brought judgment on on capania the
[1:57:11] same thing happened to the city of capan
[1:57:13] it went under the deep sea wow are we
[1:57:18] together
[1:57:20] and about 200 uh two or 300 years after
[1:57:25] his prophecy like all the coastal town
[1:57:29] every one of them still standing but
[1:57:33] capan and it lays be it lays in the
[1:57:36] bottom of the sea and fqu sunk it into
[1:57:41] the sea praise the
[1:57:44] Lord and then prophesying Los Angeles

[2:07:00] so you see what is he doing he's
[2:07:03] connecting the
[2:07:05] vision he's
[2:07:08] connecting this
[2:07:11] happening with Revelation chapter 1 yes
[2:07:14] sir praise the Lord if you think that is
[2:07:18] not the Fulfillment as a Christian go

[2:08:02] his glorified body brother Bram says
[2:08:04] that does not ring bell to

[2:08:10] the continuation of the ministry of
[2:08:12] Jesus
[2:08:14] Christ how is he Contin continuing his
[2:08:18] ministry on Earth in a glorified body
