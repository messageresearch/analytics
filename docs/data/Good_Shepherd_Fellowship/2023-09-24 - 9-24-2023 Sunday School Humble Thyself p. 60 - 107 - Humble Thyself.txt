TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is loud at any time on Earth will certainly do a most racial thing if you don't spend that time in service of God I don't care what he does if you're going to be a heartbreak for the women or so forth you better take that young age that first 25 if you're going to be a carpenter a mechanic or something you better take the second 25 see but I was thinking about what about me what would I take I'd take from 75 to 100 I'd be smarter wiser i' be more settled I know more about what I'm doing I'm 10 eight or 10 years older than the last time I was overseas I won't jump in like I'm killing snakes I know more about it see I know how is it like a dog fighting the see you know about how to take a hold of you don't jump in there scratch you up see know his tricks and watch him what he does and we learn more about the enemy so we've got to find out all of his techniqus and how he approaches and what he does learn his punches then you're trained to go in on you see so I believe now I told her wife I believe I'm better shape now once when it's 40 years old and went over I'm 54 now I believe if I live and can still get around as good as can now when I'm a 100 if I if Jesus would carry that long I'd be in better shape than I am now to go because you know more about it you know more about what to do and how to handle it how to handle the situation amen take a lot of people now if you're going to get operated on say say a new doctor just graduated the other day and just come out of medical school you's never had an operation yet let him do it oh oh no you say nothing to do not that guy no sir yet I don't want him putting on KN on me i' really go down here and get so and so I know he's had a lot of operations he knows how to do it that's that's you think about this but what about that soul I want somebody who knows where they're at knows the RO who's traveling yes indeed the Lord bless you all right brother get up here now God bless name don't forget now next time I was just uh had a surprise in my heart for the thing because in myself I had recognized I esteemed the ministry of my many Brethren outside of there before brother Brandon come I said I don't know is he a minister tonight I was talking to do Lee ve here and I said I was in the meeting at Middletown Ohio and you were the one that talked through the day and I said I deeply appreciated the meeting along with the teaching at brother veale did over there in conjunction with the meeting at Middletown yes and I said I esteemed the Servants of God and uh one of us I said whoever preaches it always does the other one good because the ministry is all inspired by the same spirit amen and uh there isn't any any selfishness or ambitiousness in me and I Delight to welcome the Ministers of God especially who are cooperating together with this and in it together with us I Delight to hear from them amen so I asked Dr Lee Vale I said would you minister at brother brandham does brother brandham didn't he might have known this but didn't say anything about so I asked uh brother Vale tonight if he would Minister for us in case of brother Brandon didn't because he associated with him in the meetings and he knows about the way this way and we're glad to have brother Veil I appreciate him and respect him as well as I do any of the other ministers and like I do all the others and so if he will come tonight and speak for us I'd be delighted to have him to do it God bless and let's pray for brother Veil some of you have never heard him and I trust that you'll pray for him I apologize to the audience I didn't know sit there I did this was fixed up God bless you brother day it wasn't fixed up he said if you didn't come good that's fine I'll get he myself brother B spoke him any time iead of in the meetings and and so forth he managed the meetings for a long time and fine Brother done a swell job and I'm sure this audience is always glad to hear Brother ve when he speak Lord bless brother so much was said uh I couldn't say nothing to make it any better and I truly believe that it was the Lord that worked this out for brother Veil to bring this man amen after this morning yeah so do you see it has to work that way we we accept that from God yes well there's so many things he was saying I I I have 20 sermons go down there off what he said I was thinking here of one little illustration to back back up what he said now we look at this watch to find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with the other we'll never know the correct time amen is that right and that takes all of us all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God it's coordination with every one of us together to humle ourselves before God and confess our wrongs and pray and believe God these things I truly believe that what brother B said is the truth that God will never put his spirit in Unholy unrighteous disobedient Temple it's got to come in the The Way of the cleansing of our hearts from all G and iniquity that we might be pure before God that he might work his pure Holy Spirit through us to bring these things to pass I I think that when you go home tonight if you read that little book of Jude you just learn a whole lot now of what brother B said and he said and I earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints that got away from it how a man of corrupt mind and so forth that come in and beile him away from the from the real things of God and God can only operate as we let him operat and so many wonderful things about saying U you know people are want Power and really they don't know what power is amen they don't really know what what what goes with it the the Way Up Is Down always you if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ see to humble yourself before him that's really a power you show me a church that's humble real humble not a a irant a church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God Amen that's that's the thing it takes hum humility humbling ourselves before God letting God just work to us don't have to make a lot of noise uh sometimes as the farmer said he went out to the field with his wagon and every time he hit a bump it just rattled and went on but when he come back he h the same bump didn't make no noise at all because it's loaded with good things so I think that's about right that we get filled up with the good things of God that the fruit of the spirit might be known through us as he referred so much to 1 Corinthians 13 there how that oh I get my body be burnt and have all these things and have not charity it's nothing profits me nothing you see we want to do that above all things it's our individual Souls that we're responsible before God see it's it's you going to have it it isn't whether I go or he goes It's You Going see it you first and you've got to look this out and come sweet before the Lord and I've always found out that the man that humbles himself is the man that God exalts when you take a person with his chest out knows everything you can't tell him nothing and his ear and and well that that's the person that never gets anywhere but you take that person that humbles themselves and walks sweetly I was talking to a man to the DAT it's just organized in the church up at the uh uh pulled out of an organization that had been uh well brother Bose and then church where they they had that great church there for so long and the Lord is Blessing and the people got to a place that they want to polish up like the rest of them and want to throw it into an organization and when they did it just those most humble Christians in there did not want that all their life had been taught against it so they walked away from it now they've got a group and the Lord has blessed them until they're coming in up into a big place now again b a church now that puts up about 4 5,000 people and they're starting over and they come to me and said brother BR sitting right there in in the office the church office the other day and he said uh one of the leaders for the CL them said what must we do I said find a man to be a Shepherd that has no reputation in all denomination just a real good Janine sweet humble brother that lives a life God will take care of the rest of us I said a good pastor that feed the sheep and be humble and than God will do the rest if you not some big know- it alls coming he's going to put this in order and this has to be this way cutting things around it'll never work you just got through it that's it every piece in the church must work together and you must keep keep up your part of it so we can see what time we're living in we may be closer than we think we are now we appreciate for the veil don't we amen the Lord bless you by the veil thank you and we thank the Lord for bringing this great message to us tonight and I got a note a few minutes ago one of the sisters and had something she wanted to tell in a dream of you just write it out tell me sister um they give her some dreams that has been absolutely true we don't accept all dreams no but Wonder of God we want to know it it's God talking to it like everything speaks the tongues we don't believe it but when there's an interpretation comes that tells us something that's going to happen we see it happen and we thank the Lord part see we want to keep it running smoothly sweetly and in order uh of the Lord so just remember that your part may be the main spring or it may be the little uh some little hand or some little part of the winding stem whatever it may be or it may be the hands on the face the clock it tells the time but whatever it is it takes us all working together and harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring this to P just think if gifts is so great what we call power and Paul said though I have faith that I can move them mountain and have not charity I am nothing am amen think of that and though you say well though I I understand I wish iing know the Bible though I understand all the mysteries of God see and still though I could do it and have not charity I I'm nothing see I haven't got no worry yet see the main thing is love God and humble yourself with it I surely uh after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought know a little bit about the gate to enter in at and if you want to get somewhere with God never let a Iran Spirit ever come around don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody's done if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person you'd be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you were in sin if the spirit of God's in you you love the other person when he's in wrong just pray for them and love one another above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us and hard tell what he will do usually when Church begins to get numbers and get to getting a little bigger or something like that then they get away from that real thing the real thing you know what brought these things to pass when I first started the Lord appeared to me down the river and told me that brother B saw that I believe in a paper in Canada many years ago where that angel of Lord appeared on the river down there is on Associated Press Mystic light over a local Minister while baptized and and you know what I did that when we had the tent meeting just across the street a tent that seated about or 2 200 people ministers come from EV word and said brother come here a minute not just a boy but or just a kid and he said how do you keep those people in one ACC C they love one another till they I never seen people love one another that's the Lord that's what this church was established upon that Godly brotherly love for one another I see him even shake hands to one another leaving the place and cry like babies to leave one another they love one another that well and I could go to their house to visit them in time the Bible was laying open and stain with tears coming at night time where fathers and mothers was gathered together and there little children around on the floor kneeling around and fathers and mothers on their knees crying and praying and I'd stand at the door and waiting waiting wait and they didn't stop praying I just sat down on the steps and start praying myself waiting for see and that that was what and they love one another they love one another we used to stand and sing that old song blessed be the ti that binds our hearts in Christian love a fellowship of kindered mind is like to that above when we are Sunder part it gives us inward pain but we shall still be joined in heart and hope to meet again I say this with great joy in my heart to Christ many of them are sleeping around in these Graves marks t i waiting for that great Resurrection where we'll meet together again let not that Spirit ever depart from this place if it ever does then I don't care how eloquent your pastor might be how well he might bring the word of God the spirit of God is grieved away and we can have all things in Fellowship in common love one another then God will work with us and we're keeping time that the people come by and say if you want to see a church that's really humble a church that really loves God droing up there that Tabernacle one time and watch them look at the care they have for one another the respect when the gospels being preached how R how everything just in order then they can look and see what time we're living you'll see the spirit of God moving among you great signs and wonders and things will be taking place if the things working together it's telling the time but if it isn't working then time is stopped it won't tell the time no more so if we want to know what time we're living just start everybody working together in the gospel loving one another loving God and the hands itself will tell the time what we're amen do you believe that amen the Lord bless you real richly don't forget now get around this week and if you Jo in the sick people it's coming in tell them when he come say dear uh I want to ask you we're having a prayer for the sick Sunday morning over the Tabernacle and um you've been sick for a while now one well I want to go I've always want to go now I just heard a message Sunday night from a brother there that how we must confess our faults one to another and pray one for another that we might be healed James 5:14 13141 15 that we must confess our false one to another before we even come for healing yes confess our fals one to another and pray one for the other see see that just exactly what he's talking about tonight brings back the beatitude in with Mark 16 that together you've got it then healings take place look at Jesus nothing but one bundle of Love see he was God manifested he God expressed himself through him no wonder Miracles and things happen his humble life and consecrated life to come from to from being God to be a man you're on Earth to express God to himself that's what made him what he was I've always said what made Jesus God to me was the way he humbled himself he was so great and yet could be so small that's right the Lord bless you real good now let's stand up and for the dism um let's just try that you might not know it sister at bless be the ti let's sing that one time will you give us this word bless be our [Applause] [Music] [Music] heart now while we sing his last first let's take one of hands when we have ther part and just say God bless you brother and sister I'm so glad to be
