========================================

foreign [Music] [Laughter] foreign that age how strange the Messiah standing up before the church and look at these precious words when he says here to preach the acceptable year the acceptable year as we all know as Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee that when all slaves and prisoners as they were been taken prison and had to give a son to pay a debt or daughter to pay a debt and they were in bondage no matter how long they'd been in bondage or how long they're supposed to stay there when the year come of the Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free they're free you are no more slave but if you desired to remain a slave then you had to be taken down to the temple stood by the temple post and it took a awe and bore a hole in your ear and then you had to serve that slave master the rest of your days what a perfect example it is of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preached the acceptable time and the time of Jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how Spar you stooped in sin or what's wrong with you you can't go free when you hear the God gospel trumpet sound out you are free but if you turn your back up on the message and refuse to hear it notice you were born in the ear with an awe that means to say that you have crossed the line between grace and judgment and you will never hear the gospel again you'll never get any further you must be a slave do the system you're in the rest of your days if you refuse to hear the acceptable year now the other part of it is I said didn't need to be answered because this coming Messiah time now is when he will bring judgment now how could those people ever fail to see who he was how did they ever miss it how could it be when it was so plainly made known and showed how could they have ever missed seeing what what a word think of it this day is this scripture fulfilled before your eyes who said it God himself who is The Interpreter of his own word this day is this scripture fulfilled the Messiah himself standing in the presence of the congregation and reading of word out of the Bible pertaining to himself and then saying today this scripture is fulfilled and is still fail to see it what a tragedy if that would be but it's happened it's happened many times how could it happen of course like you did in other times by believing man's interpretation of the word that's what caused it those Believers in them days so-called Believers was taking the interpretation of what the priest had said about the scripture therefore Jesus not belonging to any of their ranks or their societies he was excommunicated from their company and therefore they could not identify him with them because he was different from them the person of Jesus Christ was so unique that no one should have missed seeing you that was the son of God because he was a perfect identification of the scripture that was wrote of him that's the way any Christian is known what is life identifies the various things that a Christian supposed to do how you can stand there and say this day this scripture is fulfilled right before your eyes how outstanding how so plainly and yet those people misunderstood why is because they took the interpretation of some order of priest that they were listening to and history always repeats itself and scripture has a compound meaning to it and a compound revelation or it's just like it says in the Bible that out of Egypt I've called my son referring to Jesus run the margin on that you find out it also referred to Jacob same scripture Jesus was his greater son Jacob was his son he called out of Egypt which the Scofield represent all other references give to it because that's a scripture it was referring to so it had a a double answer it had an answer to Jacob called out and to Jesus called out and so is it today is the cause that we're in such a turmoil as we are and people fail to see the truth of God is because there's too many man-made interpretations of God's word God don't need nobody to interpret his word he is his own interpreter God said in the beginning let there be light and there was light that doesn't need an interpretation he said a virgin shall conceive as she did that doesn't need any interpretation when God's interpretation of his word is when he vindicates and proves it to be so that's his interpretation by making it come to pass that's where God's interpretation is when he makes his word come to pass he's interpreted it to you like if you've ever been like you said let there be light if there was I don't need anybody to interpret but we get man-made systems mixed into it and when you do you you get it out of line it's always been that way but I still think of how striking it must have been think of it the Messiah why did they fail to see you they caused their very leaders that ought to have noted that ought to be first in the scripture that must have been understanding of the scriptures they belittle this man and said he's the illegitimate child of to begin with we wouldn't believe that years later we don't believe that we would die for the purpose to say that he was a virgin-born son and they'll come to pass a day very things that we see Jehovah doing today man the ages to come that there is will die for the thing that we're talking about today you'll have to do it and the mark of the beast comes on and you're not allowed to preach the gospel this way when the Great Union of churches comes together which is in order right now for the World Church you'll have to seal your testimony with your own life to this you must believe it now if those priests could rise up and condemnity will not condemn it but you say if I'd have been there I would have done so and so well that's in your age but this is your age [Applause] you say it well a piece if he's the same as daddy today and forever the same so he is here but he shares the world has civilized become greater and educated more he's here in a spirit form which they cannot kill or put to death he died once you cannot die again he had to be made flesh in order for God to be put to Death In the Flesh for sin but this time he can never die it's the Holy Spirit now how to think that they had them things against him another thing that he would not join any of their rights then you see that still made him a bad person he wouldn't join their their organizations wouldn't join their priesthood and he wants to have nothing to do with it and then besides all that he tried to tear down what they had built up he went into the temple we call him a meat man he loves but many times he misunderstand what meat this is he was a man of compassion but yet we failed some time to understand what compassion says not human sympathy isn't compassion but compassion is doing the will of God pass through the pool of Bethesda the gate dilate people multitudes of them multitudes is no certain number but they're laid multitudes lead blind heart withered and he had compassion on the people always and he went to one person that was not lame blind hawk or withered maybe he had a prostate trouble maybe you had some little infirmity that was it had at 38 years it wasn't going to bother he was going to kill him he's laying on a pilot and he said will thou be made whole and a man said I have nobody to put me in the water but while I'm coming or someone steps down ahead of me so you could walk he could see he could get around but he was just feeble and Jesus said to him rise up take up your bed and go to your house and Jesus's question on that for you remember the scripture said this no wonder if he'd come to Jeffersonville tonight and make an act like that then still talk about him but remember he came to do one thing was the will of God now that's down in Saint John 5 19. you'll get the answer he said verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son now they ought to know that that was a very Vindication of the prophecy of Moses for the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like an unto me do you notice when he seen the man he said Jesus knew that he had been in this condition for many years see being a prophet he saw that man in that condition and went down there and waved waved his way around to those people mincing through the crowd until he found that certain Man passed by the lamb Hawk blinding with her yet a man full of compassion but compassion is doing the will of God now we find him as he would not join up with them he would not have nothing to do in their rights then he was an outcast he would not have any besides that he went into the temple one day a man went in there and found the house of God just doubt contaminated as is today they were buying selling change in money and he turned over the money tables duck ropes and plaid them and beat the money changers out of the temple and looked upon him with anger and said it's written Hallelujah my father's house is the house of prayer that you need an identity you with your Traditions has made the Commandments of God of none effect or could have bunched like I'd ever believe in him no sir they had been so hot watered in the muck of societies and filth of the day until they were so ecclesiastical froze up until they couldn't feel the vibrations of the power of almighty God don't whatever the woman can touch His Garment and get healed by and a drunken Soldier could spit in his face and see a little virtue depends on how you approach it depends on what you're looking for when you're going to church it depends on what you're looking for now we seem standing there no doubt but what the people had already warned warned the priest had warned the people now he's coming over here next seven and when he does don't you listen to him now you might go and sit here but don't pay no attention what he says because he don't belong to our group he's an outcast he has no Fellowship card he don't even have an art uh organization paper with him he doesn't have nothing like that what is he some Renegade boy that was born on your illegitimate Birth by a partner's home that a mother conceived him before they were there and they're trying to hide the thing up for some Supernatural thing we know that when a messiah cometh he'll come down the corners of heaven and go to our high priests and say here I am caiaphases but we find out that he didn't do it that way because it wasn't written in the word that way it was a man-made tradition that caused him to believe that word said that he would come just the way he come there he stood reading the word and saying to them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes and still they failed to see him or recognize him like he did in all other ages Noah could have said the same thing the day that he entered into the ark and the door closed Moses gonna raise that wind in the top yard look out upon the congregation remember God closed the door and he can sit this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes that was too late for the man he had preached 120 years to try to get him into that boat that he had built telling him that the scripture said thus saith the Lord it's going to rain but they waited too long but Noah could easily said that the day this day the scripture is fulfilled Moses the same day that the pillar of fire come down on Mount Sinai and give witness to his testimony Moses could have said this day this scripture is fulfilled Moses you know was a call man of God a prophet and while he was being called being a prophet he had to have a supernatural experience in order to be a prophet he had to meet God face to face and talk with him and another thing what he said had to come to pass her no one would have believed it so no man has a right to call himself thus until he's talked face to face with God on a back side of the desert somewhere where he met God himself it's in the world could not explain it away from him he was there he knew it happened every Christian should have that experience before they say anything about being a Christian your own experience I talked to my nephew a while ago a little catholic boy they said Uncle Bill I've run from Pillar To Post but he ever will return to find something might after night before this meeting started he's been crying and at night time he's been dreaming dreams of coming in run up to the altar we're preaching and making a confession that he's been wrong I said Melvin no matter where you try to go how many churches you join how many Hail Marys you say or how many blessings you get from man you've got to be born again of the spirit of God it's the only thing that'll satisfy the human heart that's I know they got a substitute today of being born again to shake hands of the preacher and put your name on the book but friends that is a gift it's not a Bible truth the apostles in the second chapter have to read like this when the day of Pentecost is fully come the pastor of all cotton shall cancel the people what's up on the day of Pentecost and fully cometh inauguration of church there came a sound from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind and it built all the house where they were setting that's how the Holy Spirit Come the first time that's how it's come every time since that time he's God and change is not now it's the most people they say that was for another day well he's the same yesterday today and forever every time the church ever received the Holy Ghost it's always come like it did the first time under the same prescription Acts 2 38 never has changed never will change like a doctor's prescription for a disease you write out a prescription for a disease the doctor doesn't take it to some quack drugs he puts too much of the antidote in it it's so weak it won't do you any good he puts too much of the poison then it'll kill you it's got to be wrote just according to the doctor and the doctor's prescription on how to receive the Holy Ghost is given to us by Dr Simon Peter whom it has Pentecost I'll give you a prescription repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the prescription you said them is falling even as a man is the Lord our gospel Paul the internal prescription Moses had had this experience he went down into the country and he began to tell the people I met a pillar pillar he was in a burning version he told me to tell you I am that I am go down I'll be with you take up the stick in your hand and hold it up over Egypt whatever you asked will be done well probably some preset nonsense but when they seen the real facts of this take come to pass they couldn't hold it any longer they know he was sin of God then if Moses said he saw that and testified to be the truth then God obligated if that is the truth to identify and vindicate that man's word of the truth if Jesus Christ stood there and read that day this day is this word fulfilled before you God gated to make that word come to pass we stand here at night and say that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday the day and forever God's obligated to prove that to be sold because it's his word yeah now what does it do it takes faith in believing him takes faith in believing his word that it is the truth notice what come to pass when Moses brought the children out and all those that powered him those who did not fall asleep in Egypt but those who followed Moses want to come out of the Red Sea and got out into the Wilderness God came down upon Mount Zion that pillar far set the whole Mountain on fire and a boy spoke out of there God gave the Ten Commandments Moses couldn't walk up there before the people and say this scripture that I have told you as his prophet comes to pass this day our day I told you that God with me you're not bearing a burning bush and a pillar of fire and he said this I'll this will be a sign you'll bring the people right back to this place here again and there is God in the same Pillar of Fire I told you then hanging right down around the mountain this day this prophecy is fulfilled here is to vindicate that the things I've said is the truth God give us more man like that that's honest fear and tell the truth that God Almighty could vindicate that his word is still truth he remains the same yesterday ever why wouldn't he do it he promised to do it Joshua you might have said the same the day that he come back to Katie sparnia where they had journeyed so far in the wilderness they were doubting the land being the kind of land that God said it would be but God told them it was a good land he was flowing with milk and honey and Joshua and Caleb was the only two that would believe it out of the other ten that left when they come back they had the evidence they had a bunch of grapes a two strong men could only carry Joshua and Caleb could have stood right there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled here's the evidence that it is a good land sure what there's the evidence that it's a good land where'd you ever get such things as that in Egypt there was no such places but this day this scripture is fulfilled he could have said a thing same when he prophesied and said the walls of Jericho would fall down after they marched around seven times seven days seven times a day and when they marched around that last time the walls fell down Josh away go to step and said this day the chief captain of the host of the Lord that told me weeks ago that it would happen like this this day this scripture is fulfilled verily the walls flat on the ground come on let's go take it it belongs to us this day this scripture is fulfilled how wonderful man of God has stood for the things that's right Israel at the river when they possessed the land went over how they going to do it it's the month of April the floods are coming down because the Snows nothing up in Judea oh what a poor uh General it seemed like a god boss to bring his people there in the month of April under George is higher back to the never once sometimes I might could stop here if I had time to give you just a little tip sometimes you may be sitting out of a cancer you might be sitting with a disease you think why not me being a Christian would be in this way sitting like this if I'm a Christian sometimes God lets the things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and then he comes and makes a way to it for you she might say this date this scripture is being fulfilled that he promised to do you let the Hebrew children walk out into the fiery furnace they said our God is able to deliver us in this far in the furnace but nevertheless will not bow down to your image when they walk down there at the smell of the Furnace upon them no spelling for his brother upon them they could have said this thing is this scripture fulfilled Daniel comes in the Lion's Den he could have said the same thing John the Baptist after 400 years of ecclesiastical teaching no one of that church is in a mess at that time when he appeared in the wilderness the Jordan he could have stood right down the bank as he did and say this day this scripture Isaiah 40 is fulfilled how I could stop here and tell you what that old priest told me said Son you never finished that message I said keep silly said you mean that Pentecostals don't see that I said no he said I see it in a Catholic priest [Music] he said why didn't you go and I said keep still it's the glory to God I see it and about that time the Holy Ghost stood on his sister sitting out there in a meeting and she raised up speaking in unknowing tongues tongues and gave the interpretation of the very thing that the priest and I were talking about on the platform Robert's convention last week or week before last he went to talk to the convention how did that priest say not the Holy Spirit revealed out there through a woman his sister I believe it was or what was taking place up there on the platform and revealed that thing that we were hiding the hour that we're living this day this scripture is fulfilled this day the evening lights are coming and we fail to see it notice John said this day I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness that said the prophet Isaiah prepare the way for the Lord they didn't understand said oh you're Jesus you're the Christ rather he said I am not the Christ he said I'm not worthy to lose his shoes but he said he's standing among you somewhere or he was sure that he would be there he'd be in his day because God told him he was to introduce the Messiah one day a young man's come walking down there and he seen her uh like a light on the top of him aside and he cried out Behold the Lamb of God this day this picture is fulfilled before him sure at the day of Pentecost how Peter stood up and quoted their scripture of Joel 2 38 when there was all life of those people they couldn't talk in their own language they would jabber off some else the Bible said clove and tongues cloven is a party tongue not saying nothing just a jabber and running around like a bunch of drunk people they all said well these people are drunk look at it look how they're acting how them women and men are disorderly said that religious group of that day Peter stood up in the midst of them any brethren you're the dwell in Jerusalem and you the dwell in Judea let it be known unto you these are not drunk as you suppose sing it's a third hour today but this is that which is spoke of by the prophet Joel it'll come to pass in the lazy uh pour out my spirit upon All Flesh this day this scripture was fulfilled Germany Luther was right on time Wesley was right [Music] [Music]
