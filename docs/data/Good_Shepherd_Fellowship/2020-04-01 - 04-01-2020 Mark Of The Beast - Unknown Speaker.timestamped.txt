[32:50] the Lord bless you tonight let's take
[32:53] our Bibles Thank You sis now me this
[32:58] evening of trial
[33:06] let's turn to the book of Revelation
[33:08] chapter 13 I'm not so fond of trying to
[33:18] follow you know and when things are
[33:22] coming up but I just thought thought
[33:25] about it this morning and I thought that
[33:27] well trust the Lord in and be able to go
[33:31] in this direction tonight we might not
[33:34] get through it just for an introduction
[33:36] I would like to talk a little bit on the
[33:38] Mac of the Beast the reason is because
[33:40] of all the things that are out there so
[33:43] just just to kind of encourage ourselves
[33:46] and have the Lord keep us in his
[33:54] direction so Revelation chapter 13 verse
[33:57] 9 tonight
[33:59] if any man have an ear let him hear he
[34:07] that leadeth into captivity shall go
[34:10] into captivity he that killeth with the
[34:13] sword must be killed
[34:15] with the song here is the patient and
[34:19] the faith of the saints and I believe
[34:23] the other we are in such an hour were
[34:25] the patient and the faith of the saints
[34:28] I need it there are just a lot of things
[34:30] out there that that make us one the
[34:34] rapture today a lot of things out there
[34:36] and so we want to look at some of those
[34:40] few things tonight and I beheld another
[34:42] beast coming up out of the earth and he
[34:46] had two horns like a lamb and he speak
[34:49] as a dragon and he exercised all the
[34:52] power of the first beast before him and
[34:55] cause causes the earth and them which
[34:59] dwell therein to worship the first beast
[35:01] whose deadly wound was healed god bless
[35:06] you you can have a seat
[35:07] also continue to read and he does great
[35:11] one wonders so that he maketh Fire come
[35:15] down from heaven
[35:17] on the earth in the sight of men and
[35:21] deceive them that dwell on the earth but
[35:26] by the means of those miracles which he
[35:31] had power to do in the sight of the
[35:35] beast saying to them that world on the
[35:38] earth that they should make an image to
[35:41] the Beast which had the wounds by a
[35:45] swarm in that life and he had power to
[35:49] give life unto the image of the Beast
[35:52] that the image of the Beast should both
[35:55] speak and cause that as many as would
[35:59] not worship the image of the Beast
[36:01] should be killed and he causeth all both
[36:04] small and great rich and poor free and
[36:09] bond to receive a mark in their right
[36:14] hand or in their forehead and that no
[36:22] man might buy or sell save he that hath
[36:27] the Mac or the name of the beast or the
[36:31] number of his name
[36:33] Jerris wisdom let him they have
[36:37] understanding count the number of the
[36:41] beast for it is the number of a man and
[36:44] his number is six hundred threescore and
[36:49] six praise the Lord father we were
[36:52] actually blessed upon your word and we
[36:55] just trust the Lord you'll be able to
[36:58] enorus tonight to say that things of God
[37:00] that will give us faith to draw closer
[37:03] to you we love you and we appreciate you
[37:06] in Jesus name we pray amen praise the
[37:11] Lord and with with the present crisis
[37:16] that the world is dealing with and I
[37:20] mean there are just a lot of things that
[37:22] are out there and in any strange thing
[37:25] about it is that giving among us as
[37:28] believers
[37:30] we were beginning to share those things
[37:32] you know when people share those things
[37:35] and and and we have to know that words
[37:38] have spirits you know so we just it is
[37:45] not it is net wrong to be able to share
[37:48] something is all is is also the thought
[37:52] that is behind what you are sharing the
[37:54] reason why you are sharing it now you
[37:58] know a brother could share something
[38:00] with mean just to terminus as well see
[38:04] what is out there well there I mean this
[38:06] thing is completely contrary to the
[38:09] scripture or this thing is completely
[38:10] you know just out of place you know and
[38:13] in that way it is not just to Ma get in
[38:17] and just laugh at it but it's also to
[38:19] have the grace to be appreciated what to
[38:22] appreciate what God has given to us and
[38:24] then also I mean people who shared
[38:29] things because it's a problem it's a
[38:32] popular view I mean it's coming from
[38:33] from from one minister and he can go to
[38:36] another brother and because a setting
[38:38] brother send it out so it looks like you
[38:41] know it's a good thing to shear like I
[38:42] said sometimes people don't even read
[38:44] those things as we shared him but what I
[38:47] wanted to look at tonight just a little
[38:50] bit just to caution us is that we want
[38:54] to look at a little bit the Mac of the
[38:55] Beast I won't go into all the teachings
[38:59] of it I will just pick up a place here I
[39:02] had a prophet of God saying something
[39:04] and it kind of stood up to me that's
[39:07] what drew me in today so you just have
[39:09] to bear with me tonight praise the Lord
[39:11] Amen now we realize that sister faith if
[39:19] you have my code of the alleged start
[39:21] with with this code from the seal of God
[39:23] and where he says a Mac is a distinction
[39:30] it makes a difference
[39:32] it separates something you said you got
[39:38] one Mac egg you got one Mac against you
[39:42] a Mac
[39:44] but you never said you had one seal
[39:48] against you you got one mark against you
[39:53] and a seal is a sign of ownership a Mac
[40:02] is a distinction a feel is a sign of
[40:09] ownership praise the Lord
[40:12] revelation I'm in Genesis chapter 3
[40:16] verbatim says you know all of these
[40:18] things starts right in Genesis so we
[40:23] want to go back a little bit and look
[40:25] over in Genesis chapter 3 and and you
[40:30] know and be able to - I was just
[40:35] thinking about all of this - I mean
[40:37] today so you just bear with me I'm
[40:41] actually going away from what I wanted
[40:43] to speak on tonight but I hope that the
[40:47] Lord would make this a blessing to us I
[40:49] mean Genesis chapter 3 let's look at
[40:51] verse 15 and go six years I will put on
[41:03] a meeting between thee and the woman and
[41:09] between thy seed and hosi and I mean
[41:18] between the dicey and her seed it shall
[41:22] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[41:27] his heel praise the Lord
[41:31] now we realize that that was a promise
[41:36] of redemption there speaks of walk top
[41:41] legs on cavalry and speaks of everything
[41:44] that has to do with redemption and you
[41:48] know and the promise that God gives to
[41:50] the woman but you know as brother
[41:52] Branham talks about base uses right down
[41:55] from Genesis God keeps showing you
[41:58] know how you know the the protection
[42:02] that he has on his church and the
[42:05] protection that he has on his people and
[42:07] that's the reason why I wanted to bring
[42:09] this to you tonight as an introduction I
[42:12] hope that the Lord bless us and
[42:15] continuing to lead us in this direction
[42:16] we can get really into a teaching of
[42:18] this and year but Branham says a seal is
[42:23] a sign of ownership and and I believe
[42:30] that's the place were the Lord want us
[42:34] to get to as his people and as his
[42:37] children praise the Lord he want us to
[42:40] have that blessed assurance that Jesus
[42:42] is mine amen and that's what the Holy
[42:46] Ghost is all about now so we realize in
[42:49] this hour you know as the world is
[42:53] trying to figure out how to deal with
[42:55] this with this virus and they're talking
[42:58] about you know coming out with a vaccine
[43:02] every time like the small parts when a
[43:04] breakout they came out with a vaccine I
[43:07] mean every every you know illness plague
[43:12] that have come to the world they have
[43:13] come out with some form of treatment but
[43:17] and as they are thinking about it and
[43:19] and they are talking about it now
[43:21] because of fear I believe that many
[43:25] minds are running to the places this
[43:28] virus you know one now that this is a
[43:30] plague that have plagued the entire
[43:32] world is this going to be the virus that
[43:34] will introduce the mark of the beast and
[43:36] this is what well now you know what in
[43:39] in many areas before you enter the
[43:41] building they have to use a certain
[43:42] equipment and look on your forehead just
[43:45] to get your temperature and and then
[43:48] when this when this vaccine you know
[43:51] what is Bill they're going to have a
[43:52] chip in it and then when they give you
[43:54] the vaccine and I mean in all of those
[43:56] things are out there man I just only
[43:59] probably trying to find an answer but a
[44:03] bride should not be at that place you
[44:06] know sons and daughters of God should
[44:09] not be other place praise the Lord
[44:12] we must be at a certain spot because we
[44:15] have been told we have been taught what
[44:19] this what is all about what is coming
[44:22] down to praise the Lord and that is the
[44:25] reason why I want to go in that
[44:27] direction because the mark of the beast
[44:29] has been right from the beginning the
[44:31] seal of God has been right from the
[44:33] beginning right there we can see in
[44:35] Genesis chapter 3 where God is putting a
[44:38] seal talking about the seal that the
[44:41] seed of the woman will bruise the head
[44:45] of the seven it's a promise that if
[44:48] sealed there is nothing like brother
[44:50] Branham we'll talk about how when when
[44:55] Abram came out and he made the perfect
[44:58] sacrifice that the devil thought that he
[45:00] was the one and heroes of King to kill
[45:02] Abel and God raised up a set in the race
[45:07] of Enoch and here is some more in the
[45:09] race of Abraham and the promise was
[45:11] given to Abraham that he was going to
[45:13] have a seat and go heard that I mean
[45:16] that they ever heard that again the
[45:17] Abraham was going to have a son through
[45:19] whom God would be the father of many
[45:21] nations and he thought that that was the
[45:24] promise see why because even the devil
[45:27] knows that a promise we'll see you in
[45:30] there promise prays alone a seal
[45:40] it's a sign of ownership praise the Lord
[45:52] so we want to look at this to help us to
[45:56] realize that you know like like the
[46:03] prophet of God said he says this age is
[46:05] just like the sick man that wins
[46:08] that went over to the doctor you know
[46:10] and how to die right on the die to step
[46:13] because he will not take the
[46:15] prescription that the doctor has given
[46:17] him and I believe that that is the
[46:20] situation of this age we cannot leave
[46:22] the word that God has given us in this
[46:25] hour and try to find an answer and try
[46:29] to find a solution out there that are
[46:31] all floating up and down on social media
[46:34] all of these people are doing the best
[46:36] they didn't know they are comparing it
[46:38] with Scripture because they have not
[46:39] gotten a word from the Lord like we have
[46:42] got from the Lord amen praise the Lord
[46:45] so that's what we want to we want to
[46:48] just kind of all remind ourselves that
[46:50] we have because you know that's what the
[46:52] devil would do he would take your eyes
[46:54] from on the promise and put your eyes
[46:56] into the future then put your eyes into
[46:58] wondering hoping to get something when
[47:01] what God want to give you is right
[47:03] before you and you just have to feed on
[47:06] that word of God and take what the
[47:08] prophet of God says that's what we want
[47:10] to look after that I pray that the law
[47:12] would be able to give us grace amen now
[47:15] so we realize your brother branham the
[47:19] thing that that caught my attention was
[47:21] the way he brought out the difference
[47:24] here between the mac of the beast and
[47:26] the seal of god and that's what the
[47:28] scripture says right there in the book
[47:30] of Revelation you know that there will
[47:33] be a Mac of the beast and there will be
[47:35] a seed of God and and it is not it is
[47:39] not just in this time even before
[47:44] coronavirus came on the scene before the
[47:46] world was black with based the mark of
[47:48] the beast was already on the scene there
[47:50] the seed of God was already on the same
[47:52] God already had his people see you in
[47:55] this age praise the Lord and he had a
[47:58] people there was already Mac destined to
[48:02] walk away from from God's truth
[48:05] so we want to look at that tonight a
[48:06] little bit or lookout some few types and
[48:09] shadow
[48:10] I read that again that quote again but
[48:13] Urbana shades a Mac is a distinction it
[48:20] makes a difference it separates
[48:21] something you said you got one Mac
[48:25] against you and Mac but you never said
[48:28] you had one seal against you you got one
[48:33] Mac against you and SEO is a sign of
[48:37] ownership a Mac is a distinction and the
[48:42] church is sealed by the Holy Spirit amen
[48:48] grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby ye are
[48:51] sealed unto the time the day of your
[48:54] Redemption
[48:55] the church is sealed by the Holy Spirit
[48:58] showing us ownership God on his church
[49:04] prays alone but the Mac of the beast is
[49:09] a way one that they cast out their
[49:13] refuse to take and come to God provide a
[49:17] way praise the Lord
[49:21] so he says again the church is sealed by
[49:27] the Holy Spirit showing us on a shape
[49:32] God on his church and I believe that's
[49:37] the hour where we are in word I mean we
[49:40] have to like force and make our called
[49:43] an election show we have to go back and
[49:46] check our experience of the Holy Ghost
[49:49] amen
[49:50] they we just had a sensation or we had
[49:53] an indwelling experience of the Holy
[49:55] Spirit because that is the seed of God
[49:58] that is the thing that is promised to
[50:00] the believer and if the believer have
[50:03] their water whether there is a vaccine
[50:05] or whether you have to go to a place
[50:07] your your workplace where they got a
[50:10] test your temperature you are not going
[50:12] to be afraid because you already have an
[50:15] assurance in you
[50:16] [Music]
[50:18] that's the holy that's the Holy Spirit
[50:20] you know that if anything should happen
[50:22] like brother Branham says if the worse
[50:25] you blow out right now you know that you
[50:27] are going to be in a safe place
[50:29] it's not a maybe it it's not a guess
[50:31] it's an assurance that we hold in our
[50:34] heart praise the Lord and that is the
[50:38] that is the assurance that I want for us
[50:40] to to kind of fall we want to make
[50:43] emphasis on the Holy Spirit praise the
[50:46] Lord Amen because we know also in an
[50:53] hour like this there will be another
[50:56] group of people that will be looking for
[50:57] the Holy Ghost you know like the
[50:59] scripture says there over in Matthew
[51:02] chapter 25 the the fully virgin she will
[51:05] be going out looking for oil and she
[51:08] want to get she want to get an assurance
[51:09] because she's so scared of the darkness
[51:12] of the night she's scared of everything
[51:14] that is happening and all the things on
[51:16] the media she won't but that's that that
[51:18] is now with the wise virgin when she
[51:24] heard when when the car went for behold
[51:28] the bridegroom cometh she woke up she
[51:30] knew exactly what to do because she was
[51:33] ready price alone
[51:42] he says God in his church but a Mac of
[51:45] the beasts is the way war they cast out
[51:50] that refuse to take and come to God
[51:55] provide away amen
[52:01] King as soon as he was Mac was sent away
[52:08] praise the Lord we get that ever died
[52:13] and said rise to take his place was a
[52:18] sign of the resurrection once again
[52:23] there is that ownership or that
[52:27] assurance there
[52:30] after even able died God raised of one
[52:35] in his stead
[52:36] a sign of the resurrection so even if
[52:41] the plague will harm a believer with
[52:43] that assurance of the Holy Ghost in his
[52:46] slide he will rise again brother Branham
[52:49] says the seed of Abraham was promised to
[52:52] be like the sand by the seashore and the
[52:54] stars in heaven a sign of the
[52:58] resurrection that we if Jesus started we
[53:02] may go by the word of the grave but we
[53:04] will rise up like the signs in the
[53:06] heaven praise the Lord
[53:17] so as we look at this - as we look at
[53:20] this together it just for us to be able
[53:24] to to encourage ourself in the bridge he
[53:28] also said this let's look at that
[53:30] tonight that would be the second code
[53:32] I'll be looking at and then we just look
[53:34] at some few scriptures just to encourage
[53:37] ourselves now before we even go to there
[53:40] now see where brother Branham kind of
[53:43] lay out there Mac of the beach he says
[53:48] again the mark of the beast is the way
[53:50] wall they cast out that refused to take
[53:58] and come to God provide the way
[54:02] praise the Lord so we realized that as
[54:14] the Prophet make us to know that the the
[54:20] mark of the beast and the and the seed
[54:21] of God was right from the beginning and
[54:24] that is shown out there in a life of
[54:27] King and a bear is said right there in
[54:29] Genesis chapter 4 but we realized here
[54:32] that he underlined some things you know
[54:36] that there has to do with this with this
[54:39] mark of the beast
[54:41] refusing to take God's provide the way
[54:44] which is God's provided word which is
[54:48] God's Word for the hour refusing to take
[54:53] God's provider where we can we can we
[54:56] can be associated to a church we can
[54:59] claim to believe the message but just
[55:01] bringing our heart to accept what God
[55:04] has provided God's word for the hour if
[55:11] we can just go into the chamber of our
[55:14] heart
[55:17] and acts our self do we have a heart
[55:21] that accept God's correction or are we
[55:26] always struggling against the correction
[55:30] of God we were always refusing
[55:33] correction that we always you know just
[55:35] walking away from the Word of God you
[55:38] know away what person is is one that
[55:40] just could get out there he does not
[55:42] hear it does not have no shame face and
[55:46] people in this age does not have no
[55:49] shame face when they are doing things
[55:50] that is contrary to God's Word
[55:59] refuse to take and to come to God
[56:03] providing Wayne in the bridge he talks
[56:11] about the seal again he says another
[56:15] thing a seal signify is ownership seed
[56:19] the seal has a mark on it the seal it
[56:26] has a mark on it it shows ownership when
[56:31] you are bought by the blood of Jesus
[56:34] Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost you
[56:38] no longer belong to the world or
[56:40] anything pertaining to the world you are
[56:45] owned by God praise the Lord you are
[56:51] owned by God I was I was talking to a
[56:54] brother yesterday and actually that's
[56:56] what I wanted to speak on tonight but
[56:58] it's okay I can go in that direction a
[57:00] little bit where I was talking about how
[57:02] the scripture speaks in a book of
[57:04] Proverbs that that the the barrier is is
[57:09] slave to the lender and and and and and
[57:14] you look at that principle as much as it
[57:17] is in business in in in other ways
[57:20] but you located in a strip sure you will
[57:22] realize that this this nature of seeing
[57:26] that we are born on earth was landed to
[57:29] us in
[57:29] but by default and like brother Branham
[57:33] says you know the lie between the seven
[57:37] and Eve landed us this nature so we
[57:39] borrowed it from the from from from from
[57:42] the devil let me say it that way and
[57:44] then it had enslaved us out of our life
[57:49] but we don't have to be enslaved out of
[57:51] our life because jesus paid a price amen
[57:56] he already paid a price on the cross of
[57:59] Calvary by eros here we are stay caught
[58:03] in this body that was born in sin
[58:06] shifflett in iniquity now you see that
[58:09] is the reason why the accuser of the
[58:12] Brethren always come back he's trying to
[58:15] accuse us he's trying to enslave us so
[58:19] what was given to us so what we borrowed
[58:21] but because we know a price is already
[58:24] being paid we don't have to be slave to
[58:27] the devil we don't have to follow his
[58:29] instruction because the price has
[58:30] already been paid we don't owe him
[58:32] anything
[58:34] we don't owe him anything the one that
[58:37] we all is the one that I paid the price
[58:40] [Music]
[58:42] praise the Lord
[58:44] even though I mean I still have the
[58:49] jacket as they have this stick in nature
[58:51] in Maine and he can say well that jacket
[58:54] belongs to me you know the major used to
[58:56] be mine I just gave it to you but now if
[59:00] you if we don't come to consciousness of
[59:03] the price that has already been paid
[59:05] that we don't always guide anything it's
[59:08] easier for us to be in slip oh yeah it
[59:10] used to be for you you know yeah I agree
[59:15] it used to be for you you don't have to
[59:17] agree because the price has already been
[59:20] paid you don't owe you the one that you
[59:22] owed is the one that I pay the price
[59:25] [Music]
[59:33] when you are bored by the blood of Jesus
[59:36] Christ and the seal and see you by the
[59:41] Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the
[59:46] word or anything that pertain to the
[59:51] world
[59:52] praise the Lord amen
[59:56] now you think about it like God speaking
[1:00:02] and even listening to him and he's
[1:00:08] speaking to the second and says I will
[1:00:10] put an m-80 between you and a woman and
[1:00:15] between your seal and a woman's seed
[1:00:19] praise the Lord and he's saying that the
[1:00:23] seed of the woman would loose your head
[1:00:27] now is Eve is listening to death now you
[1:00:31] just imagine that now I mean right in
[1:00:36] the presence of God or have just spoken
[1:00:38] to Adam first in God have spoken to the
[1:00:41] woman second and they were all listening
[1:00:42] to the conversation
[1:00:44] the no the wrong that they have done but
[1:00:47] right in their wrong you say that God is
[1:00:50] sealing a promise why because he has
[1:00:56] already come on the scene with a
[1:00:58] bleeding lamb you have already
[1:01:01] approached him with a bleeding lamb
[1:01:03] praise the Lord he he saw the wrong that
[1:01:06] they have done and in and the
[1:01:08] disobedience that they have walked in
[1:01:10] and there was no way they could come
[1:01:12] back to him and he came down and slid
[1:01:14] alive he walked right down and eat him I
[1:01:17] had him Adam where are you he went right
[1:01:19] to where the word and presented them the
[1:01:22] bleeding lamb and his voice is coming
[1:01:27] through the blood speaking to them and
[1:01:31] she's hearing him now himalay in the
[1:01:35] wrong that she has done she's feeling
[1:01:38] guilty but God through the blood is
[1:01:42] giving
[1:01:43] and assurance God is giving her a
[1:01:45] security that the seed of the woman will
[1:01:50] bruise the head the head of the sipping
[1:01:53] praise the Lord now so you see that's
[1:01:57] how sometimes we struggle with truth and
[1:02:01] we struggle with the promise of God's
[1:02:02] Word like when brother Branham says you
[1:02:04] never did it in the first place and he
[1:02:08] Mele we know what we have done
[1:02:11] praise the Lord there is that tendency
[1:02:14] of struggling to be able to accept what
[1:02:16] God has provided for us Adam also said
[1:02:29] standing by and listening to Dan and God
[1:02:33] never said the seed of the man he said
[1:02:36] the seed of the woman praise the Lord I
[1:02:43] believe after all of the shame and all
[1:02:47] of the hurt and all of the embarrassment
[1:02:48] and all of the things that might have
[1:02:51] gone through her mind but to walk away
[1:02:53] from that garden verse can with a
[1:02:56] thought in her mind the sea otter woman
[1:03:01] praise the Lord the seed of the woman
[1:03:07] and like the scripture says in John
[1:03:11] chapter 12 except a seed it's planted in
[1:03:15] the earth and it dies amen
[1:03:18] so he so in another sense this this
[1:03:22] promise that God was giving to her was
[1:03:25] not going to be an outward sign this
[1:03:30] promise of a seed that will bruise the
[1:03:33] head of the serpent was an evil sign and
[1:03:38] that's what the seal of God is to the
[1:03:41] church it's not an outward sign it's an
[1:03:44] evil sign
[1:03:54] we no longer belongs to the world or
[1:03:56] anything that fits into the word you are
[1:04:01] owned by God
[1:04:03] and another thing is a seal is a
[1:04:10] security Cu means you are secure for
[1:04:18] them to walk out of eating nori in your
[1:04:22] mind that God had made a promise that
[1:04:25] there will be a seed that would bruise
[1:04:27] the head of the seven they can hide
[1:04:36] behind that God has just lucked out on
[1:04:42] an EVE into a promise that he can walk
[1:04:47] away the walk away from that garden not
[1:04:50] even thinking what their life will be
[1:04:53] not even thinking about and not a
[1:04:56] mistakes that were made because God has
[1:04:59] already made a promise a seed of the
[1:05:01] woman will bruise the head of the
[1:05:03] setting praise the Lord
[1:05:08] oh if for any reason the seven came by
[1:05:11] when when I was not around it was easy
[1:05:15] for Eve to remind him you remember God
[1:05:17] said my seed will bruise your head she
[1:05:22] did she never had to be intimidated
[1:05:24] again because she had a promise a seal
[1:05:33] is a security si means you as seek heal
[1:05:40] now you that don't believe in eternal
[1:05:43] security I don't know but a seal
[1:05:48] signifies security to its destination
[1:05:54] whoa onto the guide I try to break that
[1:05:57] seal and the Holy Spirit seal cannot be
[1:06:02] broken
[1:06:03] praise the Lord amen
[1:06:06] the Holy Spirit see you cannot be broken
[1:06:09] there is not there is not a Vashem that
[1:06:13] can break the Holy Ghost seal there is
[1:06:15] not a bastion they can give you that
[1:06:17] would break the Holy Ghost see you and
[1:06:18] take the Holy Ghost and give you the
[1:06:19] mark of the beast why can we go for the
[1:06:22] real thing when people can hold to the
[1:06:26] promise of God and let it be real in
[1:06:28] your life
[1:06:33] praise the Lord has been burning he says
[1:06:37] I was about to travel and he says they
[1:06:39] have given me fussing all over my body
[1:06:41] for for that trip I told him I don't
[1:06:43] need it but it's the Lord I couldn't go
[1:06:49] over there without those passing now I'm
[1:06:54] not preaching you to go for the Vasan
[1:06:56] what I'm preaching here is that no Vasan
[1:06:58] is the mark of the beast like the
[1:07:01] scripture says no medical equipment of
[1:07:08] testing in your head to get your
[1:07:10] temperature is the mark of the beast if
[1:07:17] you are afraid for I mean for you to be
[1:07:20] tested you better check down your faith
[1:07:24] you better check in your heart for that
[1:07:26] insurance all of the Holy Ghost because
[1:07:30] that's the thing that matters in this
[1:07:32] hour
[1:07:34] that is the thing that is going to get
[1:07:37] us out of here that is the thing that is
[1:07:39] going to get us over this plague that is
[1:07:42] the thing that is going to bring the
[1:07:43] church out it's a Holy Spirit it's not
[1:07:48] how smart we can be or how much we can
[1:07:53] evolve
[1:08:00] what is giving out there in the world
[1:08:03] the holy spirit see you cannot be broken
[1:08:06] you all have heard me say that people
[1:08:10] people said that that would make me to
[1:08:13] do this no no the devil didn't do it
[1:08:18] you just wasn't see you in so then cause
[1:08:24] you were not seal in he says and when
[1:08:31] you assume in sorry he see you out
[1:08:34] praise the Lord that that's what matters
[1:08:39] amen that's what matters when we are see
[1:08:42] you in that they will see you out
[1:08:55] if there was anything that we were we I
[1:08:57] mean the the the church to be thinking
[1:09:01] about or the bride should be thinking
[1:09:02] about is I mean getting a refilling of
[1:09:06] the Holy Ghost and walking out of our
[1:09:07] house everyday having that full
[1:09:09] assurance in our heart that as we go go
[1:09:12] out and come back in I mean the Lord is
[1:09:15] with us he's dwelling in our hearts and
[1:09:17] that would be worrying about I mean just
[1:09:19] a plague in our mind with all the things
[1:09:21] that is out being praise the Lord
[1:09:27] I heard someone saying from from a video
[1:09:31] somebody say me and says I wonder if
[1:09:34] John I wonder if John in a vision was
[1:09:39] seen what is going on with people being
[1:09:43] skinned on their forehead they are just
[1:09:46] wondering it's not the word of the Lord
[1:10:01] praise the Lord let me take a stripper
[1:10:04] yeah let's look at Jeremiah chapter 3
[1:10:45] praise the Lord now yet God is speaking
[1:10:49] to Jeremiah he's talking about how
[1:10:52] Israel has played the harlot Jeremiah
[1:10:56] chapter 3 that's look at verse 3 he says
[1:11:00] therefore the shell has been withholding
[1:11:05] and there have been no lettering and
[1:11:11] thou have a wool for head they refused
[1:11:19] to be ashamed now God was telling Israel
[1:11:24] because of all that they have done they
[1:11:27] are walking prowling in their
[1:11:31] disobedience against God's Word
[1:11:34] amen he's saying you have the forehead
[1:11:38] of a wall what is the forehead of a wall
[1:11:41] it's a girl that was trained by her
[1:11:45] parents to be shaming and respectful and
[1:11:48] she don't care what clothes she word
[1:11:51] because she won money she can stay in
[1:11:54] the street and cars can be passing by
[1:11:56] she don't care who's looking at her I
[1:11:59] mean she just had the forehead they have
[1:12:02] boldness in her face possessed by the
[1:12:06] devil to strip herself and just stand by
[1:12:08] the street she don't care even if a
[1:12:09] father coming passed by that's the
[1:12:13] forehead of a war and God is addressing
[1:12:17] Israel he says that's the kind of a
[1:12:19] forehead you have you can stand right in
[1:12:22] the face of God's Word with all that
[1:12:24] I've done for you and you can still go
[1:12:27] after idols you can still go after
[1:12:30] strange teachings the forehead of the
[1:12:37] ward praise the Lord and that's the same
[1:12:42] thing verbatim says what the Mack is is
[1:12:44] refusing the correction of God standing
[1:12:48] right in the face of God's Word you can
[1:12:50] argue to get yourself out of God's Word
[1:12:57] that is the mark in the in the forehead
[1:13:01] it's a kind of fun it's a kind of a
[1:13:04] mindset that that always rebelled
[1:13:07] against God's Word
[1:13:09] whenever truth is presented you have
[1:13:12] something to counter it you can argue
[1:13:14] about it it is not just dared to say
[1:13:18] beer unto me according to your word it's
[1:13:22] not just there to say oh I surrender you
[1:13:25] always have to have another thing you
[1:13:28] always have to argue that truth why is
[1:13:30] it not this way why did the Bible say
[1:13:33] that why you know Old Testament is this
[1:13:43] place Lord we notice it's a rebellious
[1:13:52] spirit against truth amen
[1:13:59] it's a rebellious spirit against truth
[1:14:02] look at our Lord Jesus he was born the
[1:14:06] word he was now born in seen he was born
[1:14:11] but a virgin an injured announces his
[1:14:14] birth but when he was met by the devil
[1:14:21] he never used his deity rinsing well you
[1:14:25] know I was not born in sin I never pay
[1:14:29] talk of what you introduced to Adam he
[1:14:32] never used his deity he used the word it
[1:14:35] is written so he even humble himself to
[1:14:40] the word and said sit on it is written
[1:14:46] the devil comes and say yeah I know
[1:14:48] illustrating but it is also written that
[1:14:50] he would give his angels charge over
[1:14:52] thee I mean he could have just used the
[1:14:55] divinity that was behind him but he gets
[1:14:59] back to the word again and said it is
[1:15:02] written that I should not tempt the LORD
[1:15:05] thy God
[1:15:08] that is that is the sign that is the
[1:15:12] sign of a Son of God we will always goes
[1:15:16] to the word for our correction we were
[1:15:18] goes to the word for our defense we were
[1:15:21] goes for the word for our protection we
[1:15:24] will go to the word for our comfort who
[1:15:27] goes to the word to solve our problems
[1:15:32] because the word is the secure place
[1:15:35] that God has placed us that's where we
[1:15:38] find security that is the fear of God
[1:15:46] when we have I mean issue comes we I
[1:15:50] mean people they have work I mean no
[1:15:53] conscious of the Word of God
[1:15:55] you call this frame they have no example
[1:15:59] in their lives they will go to this
[1:16:01] other person the house I mean they don't
[1:16:04] have no godly example what is caring
[1:16:10] what is caring people in that direction
[1:16:14] why is because there is a spirit that
[1:16:20] refused truth then or there if they
[1:16:23] prayed and read a Bible the Bible would
[1:16:26] tell them something to get in line with
[1:16:29] the way God want them to do that God
[1:16:33] even to a king if you do ask your
[1:16:35] brother Abel but it was not in him to do
[1:16:39] it he refused refused correction refused
[1:16:47] confection refused to surrender yet we
[1:16:53] want to experience the power of God we
[1:16:55] want to experience praise the Lord
[1:17:06] Ezekiel chapter 3 let's take another
[1:17:08] verse here now we together
[1:17:33] we together praise the Lord
[1:17:47] okay I think I have a few minutes out
[1:17:49] soon leave you just a feather if you
[1:17:52] know quickly I just send you a code that
[1:17:55] I want to refer to Ezekiel chapter 3
[1:17:58] let's let's look game every time I try
[1:18:05] to multitask I get confused but can get
[1:18:08] away from me
[1:18:16] let's see how God speaks to his 7-year
[1:18:18] Ezekiel also
[1:18:35] oh I see why I'm looking in the wrong
[1:18:39] chapter I'm asked him I said what did I
[1:18:43] wrote down here Ezekiel chapter 3 now
[1:18:48] God speaking to Ezekiel son of man go
[1:18:54] get Aeon to the house of Israel that is
[1:18:56] verse 4 God is instructing him to go to
[1:19:00] the house of Israel let's look at verse
[1:19:01] 9 verse 8 that's why I want to I want to
[1:19:05] look at when I be home I have made a I
[1:19:09] have made a face strong against the
[1:19:15] offense and therefore has strong and
[1:19:19] died for head strong against their
[1:19:24] forehead as a son as an adamant harder
[1:19:31] then flint have I made that forehead
[1:19:35] fear them that neither be dismayed at
[1:19:41] their logs though they be a rebellious
[1:19:47] house now here's God also talking to
[1:19:51] Ezekiel and tell him that he has given
[1:19:54] him a forehead wish of course it
[1:19:58] represents a mindset amen
[1:20:04] I'm sending you to this rebellious house
[1:20:07] I'm sending you to this disobedient
[1:20:10] people but I'm going to keep you in the
[1:20:13] mindset of my will can you imagine even
[1:20:19] Jeremiah prophesied to Israel that they
[1:20:23] are going into captivity and talking
[1:20:25] about how the Babylonians is coming to
[1:20:28] amigo to to ravage the place and all of
[1:20:31] the things and he and this is his people
[1:20:36] he's not even sugarcoating of what God
[1:20:40] is saying he's not even trying to say
[1:20:42] well you know please I mean he's not
[1:20:46] begging him he's saying the Word of God
[1:20:47] just the way the
[1:20:49] God want him to see it God put in his
[1:20:53] prophet in a mindset that no matter how
[1:20:56] the offense is I speak my word just ask
[1:21:01] I wanted to be spoken praise the Lord
[1:21:09] it's a mindset it's a mindset to do what
[1:21:15] God's will were seized and the mark of
[1:21:19] the beast on the forehead is a mind said
[1:21:21] I no matter what the Word of God says I
[1:21:24] can take it from the King James I would
[1:21:25] go and look for the for the Living Word
[1:21:28] translation you read a living word
[1:21:29] translation it brings it area no they
[1:21:31] don't want it I want it they want to
[1:21:33] find a good news maybe the good news for
[1:21:35] water this done for me you go to the
[1:21:37] good news and it says they keep finding
[1:21:39] a way to get out of God's Word it's just
[1:21:44] a mindset a mindset that cannot take
[1:21:47] true from God's Word
[1:21:48] they will rather take it from the media
[1:21:50] they'll rather believe what the internet
[1:21:52] says though rather believe was one
[1:21:54] drunker or somebody you know they have
[1:21:57] no good example in your life who said
[1:21:59] instead of taking what the Word of God
[1:22:01] says but here is God putting his people
[1:22:10] and that's what he want us to be we have
[1:22:14] to be in a mindset that he is our
[1:22:16] protector we have to be in a mindset
[1:22:19] that he is our provider no matter what
[1:22:23] what how ugly it is and what they say
[1:22:25] they are bringing we have to know that
[1:22:27] our security is in him is for them for
[1:22:30] the bride a believer to be in their
[1:22:32] mindset
[1:22:39] I think the problem is there people feel
[1:22:42] their minds
[1:22:43] with the media more than feeding their
[1:22:45] minds with the Word of God they feed
[1:22:49] their minds
[1:22:49] oh you saw this other thing on Facebook
[1:22:51] oh you saw this other thing on whatsapp
[1:22:53] or you've sorted until people would send
[1:22:55] them out I mean things that are not real
[1:23:01] praise the Lord
[1:23:04] just recently I was I was I was talking
[1:23:06] to her brother fellowshiping with a
[1:23:08] brother some one brother sent me
[1:23:10] something and and and what he and what
[1:23:13] they did in that is theater
[1:23:15] it took brother branham picture behind
[1:23:18] by the arabesque Oh puppet that's how
[1:23:22] terrible the Internet is and you have a
[1:23:25] court a quotation of brother branham
[1:23:27] dear now just seeing that there is
[1:23:32] something wrong with that picture
[1:23:34] it just told the truth of what the
[1:23:38] Prophet is saying off I mean I just when
[1:23:48] I open open the the message that he sent
[1:23:50] me and I could just identify it's the
[1:23:53] brother branham they were preaching
[1:23:54] better a basecoat charge he was never
[1:23:59] there he said a way to make what he says
[1:24:04] you know have strength or to vindicate
[1:24:08] what he says we have to take his picture
[1:24:11] and hang him in a cloud we have to take
[1:24:13] his picture and put him right in good
[1:24:15] shape for tabernacle for people to know
[1:24:19] that yeah we are really preaching
[1:24:20] brother branham message we gotta take
[1:24:22] his picture and and you know to do
[1:24:25] something on the computer they have him
[1:24:26] right behind you that just aligned
[1:24:29] spirit as much as we love the Prophet we
[1:24:38] must not trick him like that I think if
[1:24:41] you even send him a photo like that he
[1:24:43] SME is going to be astonished when did
[1:24:45] this happen
[1:24:52] what is our mindset what is our mindset
[1:25:01] when we wake up in the morning what is
[1:25:04] our mindset because that that will be
[1:25:07] your mark on your forehead
[1:25:09] it's your mindset what are you thinking
[1:25:12] about what are you meditating on
[1:25:27] praise the Lord we see the a type of a
[1:25:32] rebellious mind said that God is strife
[1:25:35] she's just like the forehead of the
[1:25:41] world
[1:25:41] that's a rebellious mindset no matter
[1:25:43] what you say I don't care what the
[1:25:46] courts say I don't care what the
[1:25:47] scripture says I'm gonna do what I have
[1:25:51] to do anyway that's the forehead of the
[1:25:58] wall she don't she don't care if her
[1:25:59] mama comes by she has choosing that as a
[1:26:03] lifestyle she's going to dress that way
[1:26:09] that's the kind of a forehead she had
[1:26:11] she can goes right in the middle of the
[1:26:13] street she's not hiding in the corner
[1:26:17] she doesn't have shame face right in the
[1:26:24] house of God
[1:26:38] praise the Lord and we see the mindset
[1:26:44] of a son of God is he here he says I'm
[1:26:51] gonna give you I'm gonna make your
[1:26:58] forehead so strong right in the face of
[1:27:04] a rebellious generation you would say
[1:27:07] speak the truth you would say speak the
[1:27:12] truth the ice is now going to terrify
[1:27:17] you when you're even you are put before
[1:27:20] the king I'm gonna make your head so
[1:27:22] high to stand for what is right
[1:27:36] praise the Lord
[1:27:47] what are people talk about brother
[1:27:49] Branham says some people get the wrong
[1:27:51] impression of what their anointing is
[1:27:58] did you ever think of death when was the
[1:28:04] greatest anointing ever gave to anyone
[1:28:08] and what did and what did they do when
[1:28:14] they had anointing the greatest
[1:28:17] anointing our debt was ever give to
[1:28:20] anyone was Jesus Christ we have the
[1:28:27] spirit by measure he had it with our
[1:28:31] measure and one day he entered into the
[1:28:37] temple and pick up the straw and he read
[1:28:40] the Spirit of the Lord the Spirit of God
[1:28:45] is upon me he was testifying that I had
[1:28:49] the seal of God I have the Holy Ghost
[1:28:53] upon me the Spirit of God is upon me for
[1:28:59] he has an ottoman to preach the
[1:29:02] acceptable year to bind up the broken
[1:29:04] had to heal the sick to give sight to
[1:29:07] the blind
[1:29:08] and now we would think if such anointing
[1:29:12] was on him there's been prophesied eight
[1:29:16] hundred years before that it will come
[1:29:19] and year he was with that type of
[1:29:22] anointing the full blessing and
[1:29:26] anointing of the Lord upon him we will
[1:29:29] want to run all over the building
[1:29:32] screaming and hollering but the Bible
[1:29:35] said he laid down the straw and sat down
[1:29:42] and precious words proceeded from his
[1:29:47] mouth that's what he done under the
[1:29:51] anointing the anointing is not emotions
[1:29:57] they anointing it
[1:30:00] brain power in control praise the Lord
[1:30:06] that's what the Holy Ghost is giving for
[1:30:08] for us to control our temper control our
[1:30:12] thoughts control our eyes control our
[1:30:15] desire control our tongue that's why the
[1:30:19] Holy Ghost is giving for and that is the
[1:30:27] seed of God
[1:30:36] praise the Lord
[1:30:50] I just wanted to address all of those
[1:30:53] things that are out there because we can
[1:30:59] like ourself in a room like the family
[1:31:02] in the house refuse to go to hospital
[1:31:06] refused to go to church refused to do
[1:31:08] whatever I refused to do everything and
[1:31:13] see if our hearts a snap in obedience to
[1:31:17] God's Word that's what the seed of God
[1:31:25] is a had I use the serrano to God a life
[1:31:36] that is willing to be corrected by God's
[1:31:40] truth a heart that is ready to run to
[1:31:47] repentance and ask God for His grace and
[1:31:53] His mercy like the heart of the prodigal
[1:31:58] son he was ready to run back home he
[1:32:05] never said what I've wasted everything I
[1:32:07] rather just keep going I'm just going to
[1:32:09] go until I die he was ready to go back
[1:32:13] home
[1:32:20] it's a sign of ownership the believers
[1:32:24] hold that sound in his heart he knows
[1:32:28] that all that I have belongs to the Lord
[1:32:32] I've been bought by a price so he just
[1:32:37] can't live anyway surrounding himself to
[1:32:43] the Word of God I believe we are right
[1:32:45] in that our what the children of God
[1:32:49] we're gonna be so glad that he paid the
[1:32:55] price for us we're gonna be so glad that
[1:32:58] he gave us the promise of his spirit we
[1:33:02] know that we are possessing it can you
[1:33:07] just think about it in the mists of all
[1:33:09] of this you are at peace you don't even
[1:33:14] know the kind of a fear that this word
[1:33:17] is honor the thing that is terrifying
[1:33:21] people have not even come now you have
[1:33:24] not visit your mind
[1:33:36] Ezekiel chapter 9 but Branham says also
[1:33:40] it was the sign of the Holy Spirit they
[1:33:46] see you on their forehead when they were
[1:33:50] praying for the abomination that is done
[1:33:54] in the city
[1:33:55] it says he said it was an evidence that
[1:33:58] he had the seal of God and evidence of
[1:34:03] the Holy Spirit in our time we'll be
[1:34:06] praying and saying god save those people
[1:34:08] that I exposed to these things right in
[1:34:12] the city of New York is save them Lord
[1:34:20] why because you already know you are in
[1:34:22] a secure place you already know his
[1:34:24] protection is around you you want to get
[1:34:32] on your knees and just be so concerned
[1:34:34] about you and your family and your
[1:34:36] children and I mean and your relatives
[1:34:39] will be praying for the city of
[1:34:42] Minneapolis you be praying for the city
[1:34:44] of New York when you go dating and
[1:34:50] listening to the news and year all of
[1:34:52] those things that are happening you'll
[1:34:53] be praying for children that their
[1:34:55] parents are quarantined and their sake
[1:34:59] if those parents leave them there will
[1:35:02] be there will be offerings and evidence
[1:35:07] of the Holy Spirit a heart that is seal
[1:35:09] a heart that is in security will be
[1:35:13] crying out for the ones that are
[1:35:15] perishing
[1:35:27] praise the Lord
[1:35:32] I hope that this kind of makes sense to
[1:35:37] you but it's just I mean all of the
[1:35:40] things that are out there in pretty soon
[1:35:44] we can get ourself workup in all all the
[1:35:47] theories that are out there all the
[1:35:49] theories and then we can leave the word
[1:35:52] of God
[1:35:53] the safest place if you don't have
[1:36:01] insurance of the Holy Spirit you better
[1:36:04] be praying that God gave you the Holy
[1:36:05] Ghost because that is the CEO of God and
[1:36:14] if you have the Holy Ghost you better
[1:36:17] pray that God gave you more of the Holy
[1:36:18] Ghost praise the Lord
[1:36:21] may he just refill you and refill you
[1:36:23] and refill you that you were having
[1:36:26] mindset that we stay in the promise of
[1:36:29] God no matter how all good things go you
[1:36:33] will be so stubborn to believe God's
[1:36:35] Word the word can be stubborn about
[1:36:38] everything but you will be stubborn that
[1:36:40] God said it and I believe it that's that
[1:36:42] - it praise the Lord
[1:36:55] we were stopped here tonight this bad
[1:36:58] boy yes

[1:37:53] grave many tonight there's a sense of
[1:38:00] fear in their spirit and sense of fear

[1:38:05] our self there's a sense of fear and
[1:38:11] that is the thing that we need to
[1:38:14] address that is the thing that we need
