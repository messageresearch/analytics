[57:19] maybe satan
[57:23] okay i'll just touch a little bit of
[57:29] our brother elkanah and
[57:34] our sister hannah so
[57:37] this couple was
[57:42] was very good now with
[57:46] the story you know very well where i
[57:49] want you to put
[57:50] attention is
[57:53] most of the time when something good
[57:57] want to come from god
[57:59] there is always like a trial
[58:04] that's where i want to go just for a few
[58:06] minutes before we pray
[58:10] god doesn't want
[58:13] to give that things you you don't feel
[58:15] that
[58:17] you you you went through it
[58:21] that's why when you asking something
[58:24] from
[58:25] god you ask
[58:29] and you you are thinking is going to
[58:32] give you
[58:33] in your way of thinking but god
[58:36] always bring another way
[58:39] to answer your prayer sometimes we miss
[58:43] the answer
[58:44] because we are expecting in our
[58:47] own ways
[58:51] grab the hand for the lord praise
[58:54] god amen wonderful god
[58:59] because the god of prophets
[59:02] the god of this bible the god of the
[59:06] entire message the bill of fire
[59:10] we have them is in our midst
[59:14] but what sometimes we feel like is not
[59:17] in our midst
[59:19] sometimes we feel like it doesn't answer
[59:22] our prayer
[59:24] sometimes we feel like what i did you
[59:27] start to check yourself maybe i did
[59:28] something wrong
[59:30] but my heart doesn't condemn me
[59:33] so i don't know what's going on
[59:37] the age we are living in a
[59:40] very dangerous age very dark age
[59:44] and a glorious age
[59:48] you know uh barbara always said where
[59:50] there is
[59:52] god the devil always be aside
[59:56] so sometimes you know i was
[59:59] uh in the question answer was
[1:00:02] asking if for 54 years asking like
[1:00:05] saying something
[1:00:06] said that he said sometimes
[1:00:10] you can think like you are in a darkness
[1:00:15] but god is just next to you
[1:00:19] why because
[1:00:22] god create let the darkness for you
[1:00:26] to appreciate the light
[1:00:30] you will never understand when
[1:00:33] somebody he doesn't have a fault
[1:00:37] and he said i'm hungry can you help me
[1:00:41] if you never go through that way
[1:00:45] you must also pass that way before you
[1:00:48] have a food
[1:00:49] you struggle you are sick then you can
[1:00:52] obey
[1:00:52] also when someone said i remember when
[1:00:56] i was hungry i know how hunger can make
[1:00:59] somebody to fail
[1:01:00] hello are you with me don't sleep on me
[1:01:03] please i don't like someone sleeping
[1:01:05] preaching
[1:01:07] i'm gonna just say hey man go to wake up
[1:01:09] praise god
[1:01:11] i'm not reading today i'm not reading
[1:01:13] too much we just
[1:01:14] say what it's around here
[1:01:17] so when you want to talk to god
[1:01:21] when you are asking god something
[1:01:25] you have to surrender i love that song i
[1:01:29] always think of my wife
[1:01:30] i surrender sometimes you just sing
[1:01:34] because it becomes like a habit
[1:01:36] i surrender
[1:01:43] glory be to god i may i sing that song
[1:01:46] before my heart
[1:01:47] because joseph doesn't have nothing to
[1:01:49] give to you
[1:01:51] i'm not a preacher i'm just an
[1:01:52] instrument god can use
[1:01:55] it's not a preacher is the instrument
[1:01:57] god can use that's why i don't like that
[1:01:59] spirit
[1:02:00] of compare preachers he's an evil spirit
[1:02:03] from hell
[1:02:04] you i can't preach like pastor pastor he
[1:02:06] can't preach like me forgot his own way
[1:02:08] when he masturbate i can't go there i'm
[1:02:10] gonna get lost
[1:02:12] i've got also my corner where i master
[1:02:14] you can you go there you leave me go
[1:02:15] alone
[1:02:16] all of us we take our preaching from god
[1:02:19] through the mouth of god and the mother
[1:02:21] of god is
[1:02:22] malachi 4 the power
[1:02:26] of this message is to know how to put
[1:02:29] the prophet at
[1:02:30] his place and to put the word at his
[1:02:32] place
[1:02:33] and you also your place
[1:02:36] the powerful of this message is not
[1:02:39] confusion
[1:02:40] is to know your place to know god's
[1:02:42] place to know the prophet this place
[1:02:44] one day they ask brother branham
[1:02:46] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:02:48] hallelujah praise god
[1:02:53] somebody said you are god
[1:02:57] christ and he said
[1:03:00] they are not far away from the truth
[1:03:03] why did he say hey you're wrong so stop
[1:03:06] stop
[1:03:07] no the message is just on the edge
[1:03:10] hallelujah it's just on the edge
[1:03:13] i always you know church don't have a
[1:03:16] fear
[1:03:17] of worshiping william marion branham
[1:03:21] you will never worship brahnam if you're
[1:03:24] a bride
[1:03:25] it's impossible because god put
[1:03:29] something in you for not worshiping
[1:03:31] brahmanam
[1:03:36] because if you put fear you
[1:03:39] are also stay away from the blessing of
[1:03:42] the prophet what are you fearing for
[1:03:45] there is some quotation they read you
[1:03:47] feel like hey he's like
[1:03:49] god some quotation he said am amen
[1:03:52] [Music]

[1:04:10] branham and they put you also there
[1:04:12] because
[1:04:13] is the one one one person in the field
[1:04:16] they show you that that level it you can
[1:04:18] reach also that level
[1:04:20] if you don't see god in brother branham
[1:04:22] you can't also be god
[1:04:25] we are living in the age god speak to
[1:04:28] god
[1:04:29] glory be to god can you imagine brother
[1:04:32] branham said i
[1:04:33] saw the faithful

[1:07:23] in africa someone want to travel it's
[1:07:25] elected lecturers
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:37] it's depend you see
[1:07:40] it's it's a different way so it's at the
[1:07:42] level that's why
[1:07:44] they told brother about uh about general
[1:07:47] jackson
[1:07:49] is he's my friend but them if they
[1:07:51] believe speaking tangles the evidence of
[1:07:53] the holy spirit
[1:07:55] it's okay it's okay with gina jackson
[1:07:57] it's perfect
[1:07:58] you see the attitude it is wrong
[1:08:03] it's perfect with who genu
[1:08:06] but is not perfect with brother
[1:08:10] why are you fighting
[1:08:13] this message is a higher understanding
[1:08:16] you must
[1:08:16] someone is talking to you you just look
[1:08:18] at me him you know he's level
[1:08:21] you just walk away you love him that's
[1:08:23] it
[1:08:24] it's not a problem about fasting
[1:08:26] discussing only things i want to
[1:08:28] emphasizing
[1:08:30] don't ever fear of worshiping with that
[1:08:33] fear is going in assemblies all over the
[1:08:36] world people they fear
[1:08:37] to worship because a lot of people they
[1:08:39] are worshiping brahmanam today
[1:08:42] a lot of people some of you will see
[1:08:44] them here
[1:08:45] pastor we can he won't know gonna just
[1:08:47] put somewhere here and they start to
[1:08:48] preach stuff
[1:08:51] give trouble to man of god and start to
[1:08:53] adjust
[1:08:55] but like me i'll just i just smile i
[1:08:57] know he's level
[1:08:58] because those people also they must be
[1:09:00] there to worship abraham to prove this
[1:09:02] message is the truth
[1:09:03] you can't stop it but the problem i'm
[1:09:07] preaching to the bride
[1:09:08] this evening yeah i'm preaching to the
[1:09:11] brother the bride they must remove
[1:09:13] fear because
[1:09:16] without malachi 4 we won't be
[1:09:20] here like this you have to know that
[1:09:23] we came from denomination because of
[1:09:25] malachi 4. and the malachi
[1:09:27] 4 is william marion branham
[1:09:32] why with people they say paul
[1:09:35] there's no problem paul said matthew
[1:09:38] said
[1:09:39] when we mentioned brahm
[1:09:42] no don't mention it too much here no
[1:09:45] brahmana
[1:09:47] what's going on bride what's going on
[1:09:53] what's going on
[1:09:56] that's why the jets become cold
[1:09:59] can you imagine a baby said if you don't
[1:10:01] have a faith
[1:10:03] tell god the border the man you send
[1:10:06] upon the earth
[1:10:07] has prayed for you though those rewards
[1:10:09] are going to get it
[1:10:12] then sometimes you just god i know you
[1:10:14] sent someone for this
[1:10:16] age he had pray for me help me yeah
[1:10:19] i'm healed this
[1:10:22] age is a glorious age and
[1:10:27] the the revival of the churches it's
[1:10:29] over
[1:10:30] it's it's but we have to revive the
[1:10:33] bride
[1:10:34] the bride is individual revival it's not
[1:10:36] a collection devi
[1:10:38] revival it's individual revival you feel
[1:10:41] like
[1:10:42] you you just want to scream you want us
[1:10:44] to dance
[1:10:45] you want to praise the individual is not
[1:10:47] group
[1:10:49] praise god praise god praise god praise
[1:10:52] god
[1:10:52] because the message we receive is a
[1:10:54] powerful message it's not a message
[1:10:56] where somebody breaks
[1:10:58] is god as the president said i believe
[1:11:00] is the angel christian message amen
[1:11:04] praise god
[1:11:08] angel christopher is god himself when is
[1:11:11] it for the his children
[1:11:13] he come himself the great angel
[1:11:16] so now
[1:11:20] the the time we are leaving is the same
[1:11:22] way
[1:11:23] the bride they must get ready for the
[1:11:26] rapture
[1:11:27] we must get rid of rapture and when we
[1:11:29] are praying what are you praying for
[1:11:34] what what is your prayer you still
[1:11:36] praying for
[1:11:38] i don't know i'm sorry
[1:11:41] i prayed for just for short time for my
[1:11:43] wife i wasn't
[1:11:45] praying praying no no no i was just
[1:11:48] confessing
[1:11:50] she's coming my my beautiful my queen
[1:11:53] that is my queen i'm the king
[1:11:55] he's coming i'm going to get married i
[1:11:58] never
[1:11:58] fast and pray it's okay for doing that i
[1:12:01] didn't say it's wrong
[1:12:03] the thing is the secret is god must see
[1:12:06] him in what you are doing
[1:12:10] associate god in your business
[1:12:14] is a jealous god he doesn't want to see
[1:12:18] a selfish
[1:12:21] a tight you still have a problem that
[1:12:24] only died for the babies
[1:12:26] if you're not paying that i just feel
[1:12:28] for you sorry
[1:12:30] you know how where where you put
[1:12:32] yourself under case
[1:12:35] so no one will put you out of that
[1:12:37] question
[1:12:38] because those are the principle god put
[1:12:41] upon the earth
[1:12:42] a principle can you imagine bill gate
[1:12:46] he came to south africa in devon they
[1:12:49] ask a question what is the secret to you
[1:12:51] to have disabilities
[1:12:52] he said where i got started my secret is
[1:12:55] a tight
[1:12:56] bill gate maybe you think like you're
[1:12:58] more spiritual more than bill gates
[1:13:00] right
[1:13:01] because you don't know in this world
[1:13:02] they are you don't know
[1:13:04] he said the secret those are the
[1:13:05] principle god put upon the yet and if
[1:13:08] you read that
[1:13:09] scripture very well let us read i don't
[1:13:11] know how i'm going there
[1:13:12] let us read my card from malachite
[1:13:15] where i'm going okay let us go there
[1:13:17] okay we are going somewhere cleveland
[1:13:19] for the lord
[1:13:21] amen amen
[1:13:24] please god amen amen amen
[1:13:28] i want us to pray i just want to take
[1:13:30] you for prayer
[1:13:51] malachi 3 this
[1:13:55] can certain this eight i think this is
[1:13:57] eight and nine are you there
[1:13:58] i'd like for you to read with me will a
[1:14:01] manner of god
[1:14:03] yet you have robbed me but you say we're
[1:14:06] in a
[1:14:07] europe d in tithe and offering
[1:14:11] you are cursed with a curse for you have
[1:14:15] robbed
[1:14:15] me even this all
[1:14:20] nations there is two categories of
[1:14:22] people in that scripture
[1:14:26] you he's you that one is close you
[1:14:29] he's children and
[1:14:32] all people are being died even if they
[1:14:35] are not going to church
[1:14:37] they know the secret for the for the
[1:14:39] principle it's not even a blessing
[1:14:41] that's why i mean man i don't call it
[1:14:42] blessing
[1:14:43] many i call it assistance material
[1:14:47] i call it blessing the blessing is the
[1:14:48] holy spirit
[1:14:51] it doesn't mean that you have a man you
[1:14:52] are blessed no
[1:14:54] you have a house with aeroplane no the
[1:14:56] blessing the holy spirit
[1:14:57] keeps you to love the word of god the
[1:15:00] blessing the holy spirit to keep you to
[1:15:02] love more god
[1:15:03] to work for him to work for his children
[1:15:05] to do what god wants you to do
[1:15:07] that's the blessing that's the prayer
[1:15:15] this malachi 4 and the revelation
[1:15:18] of seven cells it's a powerful powerful
[1:15:22] one
[1:15:22] that's why pastor was pretty said it's
[1:15:25] revealed for the age
[1:15:26] but you needed individual revelation
[1:15:30] that's where we are now that's why we
[1:15:32] come to church and what about
[1:15:34] said you're gonna receive revelation
[1:15:36] reading and
[1:15:37] prayer reading and praying until he
[1:15:39] didn't say ask
[1:15:41] ask pastor i he one year i never asked
[1:15:44] him
[1:15:44] one question is that he preached i
[1:15:47] understand when i don't understand i
[1:15:49] kneel down
[1:15:50] i understand i move on this is a borrow
[1:15:53] with language
[1:15:54] english it's not our mother language we
[1:15:57] can express everything
[1:15:58] but when we are saying something try to
[1:16:01] understand what you want to say
[1:16:03] and what they want to say is not
[1:16:05] yourself it's not your brain
[1:16:06] and what you want to say is the holy
[1:16:08] spirit will help you what you want to
[1:16:10] say hello here
[1:16:11] clapton for the lord
[1:16:18] this bible is it is it's become a new
[1:16:20] bible

[1:17:06] chain of prayer

[1:17:55] where prayer must be conducted
[1:17:59] when god which kind of prayer which kind

[1:19:24] the the i don't know the date
[1:19:28] the tones and the things that let us
[1:19:29] clean ourselves to clean ourselves is
[1:19:31] what
[1:19:32] to know your position and the remove
[1:19:35] fear remove fear
[1:19:39] you will never worship brannam
[1:19:42] if you feel like you're worshiping your
[1:19:43] place is here
[1:19:48] i'm going to tell you something one day
[1:19:50] brother abraham was working
[1:19:53] walking one brother just feel loved and
[1:19:54] hold on like this
[1:19:57] but just detect see that this is a
[1:19:59] genuine
[1:20:00] another brother was coming behind
[1:20:03] ah that brother hold baby like this i
[1:20:05] can do the same thing when he was coming
[1:20:07] but the one didn't look at him
[1:20:09] he received the revelation brother
[1:20:12] don't do that what you are thinking to
[1:20:14] do is wrong
[1:20:15] that's the message of the hour some
[1:20:18] action
[1:20:19] this one can do it is right some action
[1:20:22] this one can do it is wrong now when you
[1:20:26] put
[1:20:26] your own understanding how are going to
[1:20:28] judge it
[1:20:32] you're gonna judge wrong we're gonna get
[1:20:34] in trouble
[1:20:35] that's why marriage marriage always
[1:20:38] advice preachers
[1:20:39] when marriage issue in the church leave
[1:20:42] it to the pastor
[1:20:44] that's the case very difficult to treat
[1:20:47] in the churches
[1:20:48] leave it he must pray and do what god
[1:20:51] lead him to do we're going to respond to
[1:20:53] him god and those people it's not your
[1:20:55] own business
[1:20:57] it's a very very complicated case jesus
[1:20:59] met it permitted
[1:21:00] moses did ask who they are going to to
[1:21:04] succeed
[1:21:04] no marriage is is is a case that's why i
[1:21:08] said
[1:21:09] those are the case because there is a
[1:21:11] spiritual marriage and
[1:21:12] physical marriage is a type some people
[1:21:16] you can say this one can't be a bride
[1:21:17] but god so he's a bride
[1:21:20] this behavior okay how can you explain
[1:21:23] to me
[1:21:24] peter and the judas
[1:21:27] a problem guy they want to wash his feet
[1:21:30] hold the body watch me jesus problem
[1:21:34] they want to arrest jesus
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:39] you've got the seed of god but when you
[1:21:42] see peter in this one you can't even if
[1:21:43] you pastor this
[1:21:44] and that's god saw him he put him a
[1:21:46] pastor hallelujah
[1:21:48] he never even know how to write his name
[1:21:51] that's what brown said
[1:21:52] don't lean in your own understanding
[1:21:55] church
[1:21:56] leaning over the word of god
[1:22:01] this message is about you to drop down
[1:22:03] your guards
[1:22:05] we we don't know nothing especially
[1:22:09] always said we don't know nothing we
[1:22:11] don't
[1:22:11] the one who knows the holy spirit the
[1:22:13] attitude
[1:22:14] toward the word of god when they present
[1:22:16] don't defend
[1:22:18] kneel down say god the sorry the
[1:22:21] attitude sometimes
[1:22:23] babaram said
[1:22:26] you you can i can you can say
[1:22:30] oh that one that's the holy spirit this
[1:22:32] one devil spirit
[1:22:34] you're judging judging it's okay but he
[1:22:36] said if i take
[1:22:38] the bible if i ask who have the holy
[1:22:40] spirit in the church
[1:22:42] 90 percent they can resign but if i can
[1:22:45] just read the bible
[1:22:47] how the bible said they're gonna start
[1:22:51] they can't sleep they start groaning
[1:22:53] because of the abomination of the world
[1:22:55] if i start to put that one i wanna ask
[1:22:56] the same question
[1:22:57] i'm gonna have two hands and he said you
[1:22:59] are hurting your church
[1:23:02] you say you are you are you are this you
[1:23:05] just preach
[1:23:06] to remove the childish in them
[1:23:09] remove the babies in them
[1:23:12] he said i'm not a judge i just preach
[1:23:15] the word
[1:23:16] so sometimes we judge wrong i was
[1:23:19] telling my wife i said you know what
[1:23:21] we when we can talk together you know
[1:23:23] you can think
[1:23:25] that brother or that sister the way
[1:23:27] behavior ever said i'm a more spiritual
[1:23:30] than him or her but when we ask god god
[1:23:33] gave him
[1:23:34] a big crown i gave you a small crown are
[1:23:37] going to fight of god
[1:23:40] are going to fight with god we've got
[1:23:42] that attitude
[1:23:43] in the message message believer they saw
[1:23:46] that they are more spiritual than
[1:23:47] pentecostal
[1:23:48] but it's not about spiritually it's
[1:23:50] about where you stand however you act
[1:23:52] when there is a problem how you handle
[1:23:54] the problem that's maturity
[1:23:58] it's not about biting talking and
[1:24:01] gossiping and destroying
[1:24:02] and and and better destroy that is not a
[1:24:05] pride
[1:24:06] everybody you see that one and you you
[1:24:07] know me i'm very strict my wife knows
[1:24:10] even if the area they knows when we are
[1:24:12] praying they know me very well
[1:24:13] i don't play we will read the word of
[1:24:15] god sometimes i stop if you play again
[1:24:17] i'm putting this
[1:24:18] in the room i close the door sometimes
[1:24:21] you hear a grump i say
[1:24:22] uncle he's like a deacon yes
[1:24:25] i don't play when we reach god business
[1:24:28] let us be serious
[1:24:31] we can play we can do other but when we
[1:24:33] go to business

[1:25:29] you have to feel like you don't know
[1:25:32] nothing
[1:25:32] and expect god to do something you can
[1:25:35] miss a blessing from the small child
[1:25:38] you're expecting brother dan brother
[1:25:40] jonathan to come and
[1:25:42] give you a answer the answer is with the
[1:25:45] small boy
[1:25:46] come to you and answer you the solution
[1:25:50] is there you are missing you because you

[1:28:54] you just did i can go trip straight you
[1:28:57] just sit there
[1:28:58] you look at me yes i just want to do
[1:29:01] that that's the only way
[1:29:02] you have to to train yourself
[1:29:07] don't don't wait anything to be easier
[1:29:09] things are not easy in christianity
[1:29:12] never be easy never be easy
[1:29:15] that's why we come to this to the
[1:29:18] service
[1:29:18] to to put some power and destruction
[1:29:21] it's not here we
[1:29:22] we are going to manifest the word out
[1:29:25] there
[1:29:25] that's why the devil is wearing for us
[1:29:27] that's where you have to measure your
[1:29:28] christianity is out there
[1:29:30] when they start to speak about wrong
[1:29:31] about jesus or whatever you did
[1:29:33] you don't want to say anything coward
[1:29:36] show your position
[1:29:38] that's why i love trump myself because
[1:29:40] whatever they are doing but at least he
[1:29:42] can
[1:29:43] say about jesus
[1:29:46] give testimony about christianity my
[1:29:48] lord jesus
[1:29:49] at least others they don't mention him
[1:29:52] they can start
[1:29:53] until they finish they never mention
[1:29:55] jesus in their mouth
[1:29:57] yeah because you know the age we are
[1:29:59] living people they are ashamed to be
[1:30:01] called christians
[1:30:04] when the people are doing nonsense they
[1:30:05] can do nonsense on the street
[1:30:08] they are they are wearing half scared
[1:30:10] things in this cold sometimes you see
[1:30:11] someone
[1:30:12] it doesn't feel cold no spirit is under
[1:30:15] spirit but it's
[1:30:16] half scared like me i'm covering i'm
[1:30:18] okay but
[1:30:23] anointing spirit of the evil can you
[1:30:26] imagine that how strong it is
[1:30:29] so those spirits are very dangerous so
[1:30:31] when you
[1:30:32] among people take your stand
[1:30:36] show the people where you stand
[1:30:39] tell you're a christian media i told

[1:44:15] lord and in your presence
[1:44:19] or we know you're here in our midst
[1:44:23] lord it's not the building it's lord
[1:44:26] it's not the location
[1:44:28] it's it's not anything we have done
[1:44:34] the lord for if there's any part of it
[1:44:36] that
[1:44:37] was our involvement then surely it would
[1:44:40] fail
[1:44:43] but lord you've you've been in it all
[1:44:48] lord from the location you're the one
[1:44:51] who chose it
[1:44:53] the people father you knew who would be
[1:44:56] here yes

[1:45:08] as they came to this service
[1:45:11] needing something from you you knew each
[1:45:14] and every need
[1:45:17] lord only thing we had to do was
[1:45:20] set ourselves to the side
[1:45:23] lord not just the minister not just the
[1:45:27] song leader not just the pastor
[1:45:32] not just the musicians or the church
[1:45:34] leadership
[1:45:35] or lord but each and every one father
[1:45:38] that
[1:45:39] those who needed something from you also
[1:45:42] just needed to come and set themselves
[1:45:44] to the side
[1:45:45] set aside their fears set aside their
[1:45:48] anxiety
[1:45:50] set aside their hopelessness father
[1:45:54] and just raise up with faith father lord

[1:46:12] times we say we've got to reach up and
[1:46:14] grab a hold of it but
[1:46:16] lord that's not even completely true
[1:46:18] either
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:22] because it doesn't matter how high we
[1:46:24] reach if you're not reaching back down
[1:46:27] it won't matter but lord we just bow our
[1:46:32] heads in humility
[1:46:35] realizing the greatest revelation of all
[1:46:38] always
[1:46:41] you reach down your hand for us father

[1:46:47] whole way through
[1:46:49] it wasn't anything that we did

[1:46:55] to what you were doing

[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:25] marriage is uh is a spiritual it's a
[1:54:28] supernatural thing that have cut your
[1:54:30] heart
[1:54:32] of an individual if christ has caught
[1:54:34] our heart and has brought us
[1:54:36] into this invisible union that we are in
[1:54:39] there is not a space for another man
[1:54:42] amen there is not a space for another
[1:54:44] man you cannot put a pastor there
[1:54:47] you cannot put the prophet there there
[1:54:49] is nobody you can put there
[1:54:51] because christ has taken a hold of our
[1:54:54] heart
[1:54:55] amen you know so and moses told the
[1:54:58] children of
[1:54:58] israel he says somewhere in deuteronomy
[1:55:02] chapter 13

[1:55:06] just like our brother said well
[1:55:08] we allowed a man to preach something or
[1:55:10] allow a man to say
[1:55:11] something it is not that man moses said
[1:55:15] the lord your god is trying to prove you
[1:55:19] he's trying to prove you
[1:55:24] that after all that he have done for us
[1:55:26] are we going to leave him
[1:55:28] to go after fairy tale or go after
[1:55:32] another person praise the lord
