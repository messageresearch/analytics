[0:00] So now let's bow our heads just a moment
[0:02] as we speak to the author of life. Our
[0:06] heavenly father, we thank thee for this
[0:09] grand privilege of coming together to
[0:12] worship thee, this glorious wonderful
[0:16] way that thou has forained before the
[0:20] foundation of the world that we should
[0:21] worship thee. We can hear our master say
[0:26] that God is a spirit and they that
[0:28] worship him must worship in spirit and
[0:31] in truth.
[0:33] We thank thee for these great things.
[0:36] We pray Lord tonight that the truth will
[0:39] be made manifest. The spirit will get
[0:42] into the truth and may we worship God's
[0:46] provided way.
[0:49] Save all the lost tonight, Lord. Our
[0:53] hearts just bleed for those who doesn't
[0:55] know this glorious salvation.
[0:59] We pray that you'll save every lost
[1:02] sinner here tonight.
[1:04] And those who are in need of the new
[1:06] birth, may he come like the rushing
[1:08] mighty wind from heaven as he gave them
[1:12] the new baptism at the day of Pentecost.
[1:15] May it repeat again. Grant it, Lord.
[1:19] Then heal the sick. Many are needy.
[1:23] We pray that you'll heal them. And our
[1:26] father is something new for the evening
[1:28] for thy servant to speak on this gospel
[1:31] terms of the salvation of man's soul and
[1:34] body. I pray that you'll help tonight in
[1:36] a special way. I ask these blessings in
[1:40] the name of your beloved child Jesus
[1:42] Christ. Amen.
[1:44] They many you've seen the look magazine
[1:48] life and them carrying articles of how
[1:50] down in Aram so forth and they've been
[1:52] bringing up thousands of Jews going into
[1:55] the new Jerusalem there across trench
[1:57] Jordan the Arabs have the old Jerusalem.
[2:00] So in the new Jerusalem they have
[2:04] brought in literally tens of thousands
[2:06] millions of Jews.
[2:09] See how the fig tree is putting forth
[2:10] its buds. Now the Stockholm church sent
[2:14] a million Bibles down there, New
[2:16] Testaments to give to those Jews. They
[2:18] never even heard of such a thing as
[2:19] Jesus being on earth. They know nothing
[2:21] about it. And they reading the Bible.
[2:23] They said, "If this be the Messiah, if
[2:27] Jesus is the Christ, let us see him do
[2:30] the son of the prophet. We ought accept
[2:32] it." Oh my. I just anxious to get about
[2:37] a half a million of those out there if I
[2:40] could around Mount Olive somewhere
[2:42] outdoor meeting and ask them that
[2:44] question. Tell them to read the New
[2:46] Testament and see what the Messiah was.
[2:48] And if he doesn't repeat the same thing
[2:50] that I'm a false prophet now speak the
[2:53] truth that he's the Messiah of God.
[2:56] Pray for us, won't you? We need it very
[2:59] much. Now
[3:02] tonight usually uh Mr. Baxter's there
[3:06] for 400 years in bondage. How Joseph
[3:10] perfect type of the church today
[3:14] perfect type of Christ. How that he was
[3:17] born among some brethren, half brothers,
[3:23] and they despised him because he was
[3:25] born a spiritual man.
[3:30] Like the true believer tonight being a
[3:33] member of the church, member of the same
[3:36] body, but a spiritual believer rejected
[3:40] and despised.
[3:43] Amen. Notice it. Joseph was born in the
[3:48] family,
[3:50] the same family of Israel, was one of
[3:53] the patriarchs,
[3:55] but was rejected because of his
[3:58] spiritual
[4:00] uh life. He was born to sear. He he saw
[4:05] visions and interpret dreams.
[4:09] And his brethren hated him without a
[4:12] call.
[4:15] Prophecies always repeat themselves. You
[4:17] know that any scholar of the Bible knows
[4:19] that when like and over in Matthew 2
[4:22] where it said out of Egypt I'll call my
[4:24] son. That was really referring to the
[4:26] scripture where God called
[4:29] Israel out of Egypt but is also referred
[4:32] of God calling his son Jesus out of
[4:34] Egypt. That is Joseph was a type of
[4:39] Christ. He's a type of the church which
[4:42] is the body of Christ on earth today.
[4:45] Beautiful. Wish we had time to go into
[4:48] it. Dig out those golden nuggets of the
[4:51] Bible.
[4:53] Now watch all the old things in the Old
[4:56] Testament just run parallel with the
[4:58] New.
[4:59] And notice how that he was rejected and
[5:03] despised and how he was criticized by
[5:06] his brethren and finally persecuted even
[5:10] almost unto death
[5:13] was taken down in Egypt. And many of us
[5:15] know the story how God was with him. No
[5:18] matter what they said about him when
[5:21] they seen him come in the field said,
[5:22] "Here comes that dreamer. Let's see what
[5:24] he's going to say now."
[5:26] making fun of him just as the
[5:30] unbelieving Christian today will make
[5:33] fun of the believer. Same thing.
[5:37] Yet a member of the body by faith in
[5:40] Christ
[5:42] rejecting.
[5:44] Oh, what a horrible thing.
[5:47] Now then when they went down into Egypt,
[5:51] God was with him just the same. God will
[5:53] be with his church regardless of what
[5:55] you say about it. There's somebody in
[5:57] your church is real spiritual,
[6:01] really knows God. You say, "Wow, they're
[6:03] a little bit of fanatic." I might speak
[6:05] on that tomorrow afternoon.
[6:08] All right. A fanatic.
[6:12] Just because they love God, they're
[6:13] peculiar
[6:15] to the world. But remember, they're
[6:17] blessed in the sight of God. God's
[6:19] people is a peculiar people. Royal
[6:23] priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices
[6:25] to God. That's the fruits of our lips
[6:27] giving praise to his name. Peculiar,
[6:31] odd, always been very much indifferent
[6:34] from the world. Separated, called out.
[6:38] The very church, the word church means
[6:42] the separated or called out.
[6:47] Israel were the people of God until they
[6:48] come out of Egypt. understand they were
[6:50] the church of God because they were
[6:51] called out, separated, made different.
[6:56] God calling Israel out, what a beautiful
[6:58] type calling his church out today. I
[7:02] think of Joseph, what when he died, what
[7:04] a memorial he left there. I think
[7:07] sometimes when he made mention, he said,
[7:10] "Now don't bury me down here, but leave
[7:13] my bone chair until surely God will
[7:16] visit you someday. and take my bones
[7:19] before you.
[7:21] Where did he get that thought? God
[7:23] promised Abraham, his father, that they
[7:26] would sojourn 400 years in a strange
[7:28] land and then he would bring him out.
[7:30] And Joseph knew God kept his word. The
[7:33] other patriarch just bear him anywhere
[7:35] he wanted to. But not Joseph
[7:38] say there's a little between the line
[7:39] you have to read in the Bible. Do you
[7:41] believe that?
[7:43] It's a love letter wrote to the church.
[7:47] There's no need of seminaries trying to
[7:49] teach it because it's not known by minds
[7:52] of this world. I've hid it from the eyes
[7:54] of wise and repudian and will reveal it
[7:56] to babes such as will learn. It's truth.
[8:00] So there's that's the reason we got all
[8:02] these different forms and kinds of
[8:04] religions and churches. It's all right.
[8:06] There it go. God he's the one takes care
[8:08] of the books. Look,
[8:11] notice though how how it was. Let me
[8:14] give you a little something between the
[8:16] lines. You know, sometime when I get
[8:18] away overseas,
[8:20] I'm very fond of my wife and she writes
[8:23] me a letter and she says, "Dear Billy,
[8:26] I'm sitting here tonight. I'm thinking
[8:28] very much of you. I'm so and so." That's
[8:30] what she's saying, but I'm reading right
[8:33] between the lines.
[8:36] I I know it goes a little deeper than
[8:38] that.
[8:40] And if you've got the Holy Spirit,
[8:42] you're in love with Christ. You can read
[8:44] between God's lines. There's something
[8:47] in there. While we're a little off the
[8:50] subject just to this, but let me drop
[8:51] you a little something. Why did Joseph
[8:53] want his bones buried up there? Notice
[8:57] when Job, an old one of the oldest books
[8:59] of the Bible, when he died, he was
[9:02] getting ready or before he died, he was
[9:04] sitting on an ash heap scraping these
[9:06] boils. And his wife came and said, "Job,
[9:09] why don't you curse God and die?" He
[9:10] said, "Woman, thou speakest like a
[9:12] foolish woman." Now, he never said she's
[9:15] foolish, but she's speaking like one. He
[9:17] said, "The Lord gave and the Lord taken
[9:19] away. Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[9:23] Some of his church members came down to
[9:25] give him some consolation, set with
[9:26] their backs to him seven days, accused
[9:28] him of being a secret sinner.
[9:31] Not much consolation there. But they
[9:35] accused him of sinning against God. But
[9:37] Job knowed his heart. He know he hadn't
[9:39] sinned against God. Many time people
[9:41] say, "See all that sickness in that
[9:42] family? I told you they're not living
[9:44] right." Now God does do that sometime,
[9:46] but not every time it's God doing that.
[9:48] Paul God here was dealing with a saint.
[9:52] A trying and proving of a saint. And
[9:54] every man that cometh to God must first
[9:57] be tried of God. And if you can't stand
[9:59] chastisement, then you become an
[10:01] illegitimate child and not the child of
[10:03] God.
[10:05] trials to try our faith. Isn't that
[10:08] marvelous? God would give us those
[10:10] trials and tests to prove us. Now notice
[10:14] this is beautiful. Then after a while
[10:16] Job saying there knowing his heart
[10:18] little Elahu came down which we know the
[10:20] Hebrew word Elah which came in from God
[10:23] meaning that God representative
[10:26] otherwise it was a representative of the
[10:29] Lord Jesus Christ come down speaking to
[10:31] Job said now look job you're accusing
[10:33] God wrongly
[10:35] said but now
[10:38] he spoke to him and he said now you're
[10:41] looking out upon the natural things here
[10:43] and so forth and he said Job, Job began
[10:46] to speak to him about the flower, how it
[10:48] dies. In a spring year, it comes back up
[10:50] again. If a tree dies, it lives again.
[10:52] But he said, man lays down, he giveth up
[10:54] the ghost. He wastes away. His sons come
[10:57] to mourn his death. He perceiveth not.
[10:59] Where is he? He said, you've been
[11:02] noticing all those things. I'm putting
[11:03] it kind of drama child form for the
[11:05] little ones.
[11:07] He said, now you've been looking at
[11:09] that, but remember that flower or that
[11:11] tree never sinned against God. Man
[11:14] sinned against God, so it separated him
[11:17] from God. But there's coming one someday
[11:21] who will stand in the breach between a
[11:23] sinful man and a holy God and bridge the
[11:25] way. Put a hand on a sinful man. The
[11:27] holy God bridge the way. Speaking of
[11:29] Christ, the prophet saw it. He stood on
[11:33] his feet. The lightnings begin to flash.
[11:36] The thunders roar. Job said on no my
[11:39] redeemer liveth and at the last days
[11:42] he'll stand on the earth. Though the
[11:43] skin worms destroy this body yet my
[11:45] flesh shall I see God. Watch when he
[11:48] died
[11:50] years later he made a specification a
[11:53] word of burying. Along come father
[11:55] Abraham and when Sarah died he went
[11:58] close to the same land that Job was
[12:00] buried in. He bought a piece of ground.
[12:02] He would let him give them to him. He
[12:04] bought that ground for a bearing place.
[12:06] And he buried Sarah near Job.
[12:10] And when Abraham died, he slept in the
[12:13] same grave with Sarah. And Abraham begot
[12:16] Isaac. And when Isaac died, he slept
[12:20] with Abraham.
[12:22] And Isaac begot Jacob. And when Jacob
[12:24] was died down in Egypt, but before he
[12:27] died,
[12:29] oh, I just love this. He said, "Come
[12:32] here, Joseph.
[12:34] He had a crippled hip where an angel
[12:36] touched him from rrestling.
[12:38] Look at that. On one side of the river
[12:40] one night, a big strong backslider. On
[12:43] the next side, next morning on the other
[12:45] side of the river, a limping prince
[12:49] and wrestle with God
[12:51] said, "Come here and lay your hands upon
[12:53] my hip and swear to me that you'll not
[12:56] bear me down here." Wonder why.
[13:00] But take me back up there and let me be
[13:02] buried with Abraham and Isaac.
[13:07] Why? Then along come Joseph. He said,
[13:09] "Now wait." They put his bones in a
[13:12] coffin. I had my hand on the old lead
[13:14] coffin here not long ago. They supposed
[13:15] to had his bones in. He said, "When you
[13:18] go out of here, bury my bones up there.
[13:23] Don't bury me down here." I wonder why.
[13:26] It isn't written in the Bible, but they
[13:28] were prophets.
[13:30] They could read between the lines. They
[13:32] knew that that first fruits of the
[13:34] resurrection wasn't coming in Egypt. It
[13:36] was coming in Palestine.
[13:38] And when Jesus came on earth and they
[13:40] done to him what they said they would
[13:42] do. And when he died and rose on the
[13:45] third day, Matthew 27 said, "Many of the
[13:47] bodies of the saints that slept in the
[13:49] dusty earth rose and come out of the
[13:51] grave and entered into the city."
[13:53] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.
[13:57] Therefore, have anything you wish you,
[13:59] but bury me in Christ. For those that
[14:02] are in Christ will God bring with him at
[14:05] his coming.
[14:07] Hide away from the world. What a
[14:09] beautiful picture. There's between the
[14:12] lines. What the Bible says and what you
[14:15] see in between the lines
[14:18] goes right on with the rest of the word,
[14:19] but it just fills up the gap where you
[14:22] wonder why they was doing it. Now on our
[14:25] pilgrim journey, we notice out in the
[14:27] wilderness while they begin to sin after
[14:31] God had ble blessed them and brought
[14:33] them through the Red Sea.
[14:36] Is it strange old that the children of
[14:38] Israel in their journey, God led them
[14:41] the first thing right into a death trap
[14:48] right up to the Red Sea.
[14:51] Pharaoh's army coming pursuing the
[14:53] mountains on one side to see Adam cut
[14:55] off but God's path went through the sea.
[15:00] Many times God lets us get right up like
[15:02] that. Then he looked down through that
[15:04] pillar of fire and the sea rolled back
[15:06] and they crossed. God made a way of
[15:09] escape. He always will in every
[15:12] instance.
[15:14] Notice then they went right straight to
[15:17] the wilderness of sin.
[15:20] Is it strange from one trial to another?
[15:24] Some through the waters, some through
[15:27] the floods, some through deep trials,
[15:29] but all through the blood. God's way
[15:32] leads sometimes right through every
[15:33] briar patch, right up over the hill,
[15:37] down through the rugged places,
[15:38] sickness, trials,
[15:41] but God brings him more than victorious
[15:43] through them all.
[15:45] Notice they begin to sin and murmur
[15:48] against God and against Moses. And God
[15:51] told Moses when he went to praying,
[15:55] interceding for the people.
[15:58] Now, why did Moses intercede?
[16:01] Now, listen closely. God had appeared to
[16:05] father Abraham years before that in
[16:07] Genesis 22 in the name of Jehovah Gyra.
[16:14] when he was offering up his only
[16:16] begotten son
[16:18] and a a lamb bladed in the wilderness
[16:20] and God stayed his hand and the name of
[16:23] God was called Jehovah Gyra meaning the
[16:26] Lord will provide
[16:28] himself a sacrifice.
[16:32] Amen.
[16:33] Oh, this is beautiful. I just love the
[16:36] word. Notice then
[16:39] right in that crucial moment
[16:43] serpents had that come in among the
[16:44] people and were biting them and Moses
[16:47] was taught in all the wisdom of the
[16:49] Egyptians and they were boasting
[16:52] physicians far beyond him many things
[16:55] and what we are today had our doctor
[16:58] skin by hundreds of miles
[17:00] but Dr. Moses had no cure for that snake
[17:04] bite. Nothing could be done.
[17:07] There it was way in the wilderness.
[17:12] And Moses prayed and God came to him and
[17:15] told him the remedy for it. I like that.
[17:19] Why is he God? Jehovah Gyra. The Lord
[17:22] will provide.
[17:25] Make a way.
[17:28] I love it. Notice then God told Moses in
[17:32] this piper symbol said go make a serpent
[17:36] out of brass
[17:38] and put it on a pole. Now the serpent in
[17:42] a symbol meant sin.
[17:47] The serpent represented the serpent from
[17:50] the garden of Eden already judged.
[17:54] snake
[17:56] turned from a a animal. Now, he wasn't a
[18:00] reptile. The Bible said he was the most
[18:02] subtle of all the beasts of the field.
[18:03] He wasn't a reptile. He was a beast.
[18:06] And he turned to a serpent on his belly.
[18:11] And that snake represented sin judged.
[18:17] And made out of brass meant divine
[18:20] judgment.
[18:21] Breast means divine judgment in the
[18:24] Bible.
[18:27] See, the people were sinning because
[18:30] they didn't believe the prophet. They
[18:32] were ching against him and against God.
[18:35] They had sinned. And because of sin,
[18:37] serpents had bit them and they were
[18:39] dying. And all sickness
[18:44] is caused by sin.
[18:47] That's right. Before we had before we
[18:51] had sin, we had no sickness. But sin or
[18:55] sickness is an attribute of sin.
[18:59] Sickness came because of sin. Maybe not
[19:01] what you done. Inherited three or four
[19:04] generations. It'll follow
[19:07] God said. So notice.
[19:10] And so God put up this had Moses and put
[19:14] up this in sign to Israel.
[19:19] And when he lifted it up, sickness and
[19:23] sin,
[19:25] a compound reason for both sickness and
[19:29] sin. Jehovah Gyra was providing an inign
[19:34] that represented that their sin was
[19:37] forgiven and a healing for their
[19:40] sickness.
[19:42] You get it? Serpent represented sin
[19:47] judged.
[19:48] Brass, see brass is one thing that you
[19:51] can't tamper with. Brass cannot be
[19:54] tempered.
[19:56] You find some form of temporal brass,
[19:59] your tithings for six months will pay my
[20:02] way for 50 years around the world.
[20:03] Missionary, if you can find something of
[20:05] temper brass, can't be tempered. Goes to
[20:09] show that God's represented brass as
[20:14] divine judgment. And God's divine
[20:16] judgment cannot be tempered.
[20:20] God is the same yesterday, today,
[20:22] forever. Here you are. I want you to get
[20:26] it now. Look, brass the brazen's altar
[20:31] where the sacrifices were burned.
[20:34] Judgment.
[20:35] Divine judgment. And in the days of
[20:38] Elijah, when he went out and looked at
[20:40] the skies, he said, "They look like
[20:43] brass."
[20:45] Divine judgment upon a rebellious
[20:48] nation.
[20:50] God have mercy.
[20:53] The skies sometimes look brass around
[20:55] here in America.
[20:58] Divine judgment, heartach breakthrough.
