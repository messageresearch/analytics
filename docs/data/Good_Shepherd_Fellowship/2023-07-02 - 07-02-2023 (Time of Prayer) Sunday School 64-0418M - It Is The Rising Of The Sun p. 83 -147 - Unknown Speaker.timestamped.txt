[0:47] everything
[0:49] which was the
[0:51] seventh day of the week which is
[0:53] Saturday
[0:55] but did you notice
[0:57] in this Memorial
[0:59] the wave it on the first day of those
[1:06] the Sheep which was the first of your
[1:10] seed that you planted
[1:12] when it comes up and ripens you cut down
[1:16] this sheet
[1:18] and take it to the priest
[1:21] and let him take it and wave it before
[1:24] the Lord
[1:26] for your exception
[1:28] that you are accepted you have come with
[1:31] your sheep and he's the wave it before
[1:33] the Lord on not on the Sabbath
[1:37] the seventy but on the first date which
[1:41] we call Sunday
[1:45] s-u-n-d-a-y of course that's a Roman uh
[1:49] word which they called it the Sunday for
[1:52] the Sun God but how it is changed is not
[1:56] as you in anymore it's the
[1:59] s-o-n-d-a-y the Sunday
[2:02] that that carnal wheat
[2:05] God's first one from the dead
[2:09] just to be waved over the congregation
[2:14] that we are disease and that's the first
[2:19] are the seeds of those the thrift
[2:22] waved upon the first day of the week on
[2:25] Sunday he raised up
[2:28] wave goodbye and ascended upon her
[2:33] in the presence of the people notice it
[2:37] was the first corn of God's wheat that
[2:40] had been raised from today
[2:43] God's first Corner weed by God's quick
[2:46] and in power
[2:47] God had quickened his life raised him up
[2:50] from the dead and he was the first fruit
[2:53] of those that slept
[2:55] the first fruit he was that sheep that's
[2:58] why they had to Wade that sheep or it
[3:00] was the first one that come to maturity
[3:05] and it was weighed as a memorial thanks
[3:08] to thank you God believing at the rest
[3:10] of them would come
[3:12] there was a sign
[3:13] and today because she was the first Son
[3:17] of God to come to form authority to be
[3:20] in God
[3:22] he was plucked up from the earth as
[3:25] waved over the people
[3:26] oh what a glorious lesson by the
[3:30] quickening power
[3:31] the first one although he had he'd been
[3:34] typed and many times and we'll see later
[3:36] that he was tired but this is really the
[3:38] first fruits of them that slept
[3:40] he was waived over the promise seed that
[3:46] had promise of life he was waived at the
[3:49] day of Pentecost when there came a sound
[3:52] from heaven like a waving Mighty Russian
[3:56] wind and it was waved over the people
[3:59] the Pentecostal people that was up at
[4:02] Pentecost waiting for uh the blessing to
[4:05] come and to be waived
[4:08] again we realized in the last days
[4:11] according to Luke 17 30 in the Sunday
[4:14] again in the days that the son of man
[4:17] will be revealed or waived again over
[4:21] the people
[4:22] who is the son of nation in the
[4:24] beginning was the word and the Word was
[4:28] with God and the Word was God
[4:31] and the word would make flesh and dwelt
[4:34] Among Us
[4:35] instead of all the teaching that we have
[4:37] in confirmation of the word of God by
[4:41] word of God by Signs by wonders
[4:44] we see the day that in the book of of
[4:48] Luke Harris as we just quoted from the
[4:51] Luke the 17th chapter the 31st and
[4:54] Malachi 4 in the different scriptures
[4:56] that we are acquainted with that that
[4:58] word again
[5:00] if ways over the people that the Dead
[5:04] traditions of man is dead and the Son of
[5:07] God is alive again with the baptism of
[5:10] the Holy Spirit right Among Us has given
[5:13] us life
[5:16] as Christ was the first one to raid from
[5:20] all the prophets and so forth all those
[5:24] types in many places he was the first
[5:26] fruits of those who said in the bride
[5:29] coming of Christ coming out of the
[5:31] church there will have to be a sheep
[5:33] waved again all I say
[5:36] oh my God
[5:39] bathing of the sheep what was the Sheep
[5:42] the first one that come to mature
[5:45] the first one that proved it was a wheat
[5:48] that proved it was a sheep
[5:50] Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[5:54] talking about
[5:58] the first time there will come forth for
[6:01] the broad age for a resurrection out of
[6:04] dark denominationalism
[6:06] we all be a message
[6:08] that's a full maturity all the word has
[6:11] turned back again it is full power and
[6:13] being bringing over the People by the
[6:16] same signs and wonders that he did
[6:19] calls Holly
[6:21] you live also
[6:25] because Ali you live also what a
[6:30] resurrection
[6:31] that that was
[6:32] and water Resurrection this is
[6:36] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[6:39] alive in Christ Jesus but God's quick
[6:43] and empowered
[6:44] he was waved to them the word which he
[6:48] was was way back to him on the day of
[6:50] Pentecost the word may manifest now
[6:54] as I said to be waived again in the last
[6:57] days
[6:58] now for instance
[7:00] you say when I weakness brother Graham
[7:02] I know what church said well I do
[7:05] but now Priuses what if if we were going
[7:08] to go back to Tucson this afternoon
[7:13] now now a huge one of us had a was going
[7:17] to go in a a big Cadillac brand new
[7:21] and all of the seats were made out of no
[7:26] skin
[7:27] softness of the letter
[7:29] soft and easy to sit in and the
[7:32] floorboard
[7:33] s were plush
[7:35] the steering wheel were nickel plated
[7:38] and had diamonds studs all over
[7:41] and the engine was mechanically tested
[7:44] to be exactly the right engine
[7:48] and the wheels for all had bearings and
[7:52] Breeze up
[7:53] and the tires were all puncture proof
[7:57] and blowout free they're all been tested
[8:00] scientifically
[8:01] they've been pushed off the assembly
[8:03] line both of them and both of them
[8:06] filled up with gasoline
[8:08] that's the running power
[8:11] the gasoline because it is
[8:15] but now
[8:16] when you're going to start them
[8:20] all those of them look just alike
[8:24] but there's one of them don't have any
[8:26] Spark
[8:29] any firing power
[8:32] what do you say the power is in the
[8:35] gasoline brother Brown
[8:36] but I don't care how much power is in
[8:38] the gasoline unless there's a spark
[8:41] there
[8:42] to manifest that power
[8:45] but there's a power there to confirm
[8:49] that that's gas please it just might as
[8:51] well be water
[8:53] until no matter how much theologians
[8:57] claim how well you got your church set
[9:00] how much education you got how much like
[9:03] the Bible until that wave sheep until
[9:07] the Holy Spirit comes upon that person
[9:11] the freaking that word the gasoline
[9:15] represents the words the truth but
[9:18] without the spirit it won't move
[9:23] but too much
[9:25] stress on the mechanics and nothing on
[9:28] the dynamic
[9:30] where it needs a dynamic power of God
[9:33] the resurrection power of Jesus Christ
[9:36] upon the church to manifest
[9:39] and to bring the past that this is
[9:42] gasoline
[9:46] might be in a gasoline Can it can still
[9:49] be water
[9:52] see
[9:53] that's the only proof of it is but this
[9:56] life host
[9:58] and it'll prove where it states we
[10:00] should
[10:01] and when you try to put the holy spirit
[10:04] in the denomination you're as much as
[10:07] trying to get a splatter
[10:11] you
[10:12] ruin your engine by getting it full of
[10:15] carbon
[10:16] but all around so fast
[10:19] that there is a ten thousand octane
[10:22] power a word of God and a holy ghost to
[10:25] light it up
[10:27] and to resurrect the power of God into a
[10:31] man's life or a woman's life or into a
[10:33] church that's shoved that Cadillac down
[10:36] the road to her
[10:39] other Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost
[10:43] which came back to us ways over the
[10:45] people at the day of Pentecost making
[10:47] him the same yesterday today and forever
[10:50] that was the first sheep come up from
[10:52] all the prophets which was the Son of
[10:53] God the king of all Prophets
[10:56] there's been churches churches bribes
[10:58] Brides churches Brides brides but
[11:00] there's got to come one
[11:03] Hallelujah
[11:05] that has to come a real bride
[11:08] there must come one that's not only got
[11:10] the mechanics but the Dynamics shut up
[11:15] that church live
[11:19] to the power of his resurrection
[11:23] until we come to that place
[11:26] until we find that place what good does
[11:29] it do to polish the hubs
[11:31] what good does it do to give her a
[11:33] facelift or a simonized job
[11:36] when there's old Dynamics in it no
[11:39] matter how much the mechanics prove to
[11:41] be right there's got to be a dynamic to
[11:44] make it work
[11:45] s that's what Hebrews
[11:48] Hallelujah
[11:50] that's what is your proves
[11:53] he wasn't only the word but he was God
[11:56] himself the Dynamics in the word
[12:02] the body of Jesus Christ cold sipping
[12:06] dead in the great shaking alive and rise
[12:09] again and roll away
[12:12] I am he that was dead
[12:14] so dead Till The Sun said he was dead
[12:17] the moon said he was dead the star said
[12:19] he was dead all nature said he was dead
[12:22] but now the whole world has to recognize
[12:25] that he's alive again
[12:27] he was not only a mechanics God's word
[12:29] he was a timeamics to prove it
[12:32] and is he being the crew
[12:36] the pride has to come forth all this
[12:39] part at him and he can only be the
[12:42] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[12:44] the revelations and the others that
[12:46] spoke of the Bride
[12:47] it can only manifest if it does
[12:50] something different from the groom it
[12:52] isn't surprise
[12:54] because she's flesh of his flesh bone of
[12:57] his bone life of his life power of his
[13:00] power
[13:02] she is him
[13:05] as man and woman are one and women take
[13:08] it from his side she had taken a spirit
[13:10] of feminine Spirit Plumbing the
[13:12] placement side faithful mechanics and
[13:15] dymatics the wife
[13:18] the spirit of him and the Flesh of him
[13:22] and put it together and made mechanics
[13:24] and automatic
[13:26] and tell the church or the people all
[13:29] these Easter bunnies and strawberries
[13:30] and big churches and finally will fail
[13:34] and pass away until that church become
[13:37] full-time many and the case
[13:40] and the spirit of God that moved him to
[13:43] do the things that he did
[13:45] he hit on 16 cylinders so
[13:51] why that is John 14 12. Jesus evil told
[13:55] me the works that I do shall hear you
[13:59] also
[14:02] I'll give him a charge of our Dynamics
[14:05] in his mechanics
[14:07] that's the world will not be able to
[14:09] withstand it and I'll raise him up again
[14:12] at the last day
[14:13] [Music]
[14:20] together
[14:21] the mechanics without the Dynamics
[14:24] for good
[14:25] neither is the dominance without the
[14:27] mechanics
[14:28] you can screaming shot and jump up down
[14:30] all you want to and deny this word
[14:33] it won't do any good
[14:35] just cranking around the pissings of got
[14:38] sparked out of fire but no gas near the
[14:39] fire by
[14:40] it'll only work as they come together
[14:44] amen
[14:46] so one will sit still and the other will
[14:48] go up
[14:49] that's the only thing there is to it yet
[14:51] they both might look like both came to
[14:53] be churches won't claim to be bride but
[14:55] one has
[14:56] mechanics and Dynamics
[14:59] it brings it to pass
[15:01] but what he said is the truth it just
[15:03] won't
[15:05] no matter how good the mechanics is
[15:06] until the time energy comes but
[15:09] Dominique Trump that bar is made to
[15:12] connect with that octane in the gasoline
[15:14] and when that exposes it causes
[15:17] a combustion
[15:19] and that combustion moves
[15:23] every emotion ever moves
[15:26] or he is a team yesterday
[15:32] that's the real power of God the Kennedy
[15:35] with the Dynamics
[15:37] notice it's the spirit that quickens
[15:41] it's the it's the spark that fires
[15:45] is not the gas that fires it's the spark
[15:47] that fires again
[15:49] see you can do nothing without me but
[15:52] with me you can do all things
[15:55] as he is the words of Father living
[15:57] father sent me so send I you as the
[16:00] father has fired me and pushed me into
[16:02] everything I do only that which is
[16:03] pleasing to God
[16:04] now as he sent me so send I use the same
[16:07] mechanic it takes the same Dynamics to
[16:10] operate it and these signs shall follow
[16:12] them that claim to have the mechanics
[16:15] the Dynamics will take its place Paul
[16:18] said the gospel came to us not in word
[16:19] only through gasoline only but through
[16:21] spark also to make it move
[16:24] yeah
[16:25] it came to us in that manner it's the
[16:28] same spirit that raised him up that
[16:31] quickened the True Believer to eternal
[16:33] life
[16:34] I remember potentially now watch as we
[16:37] are getting out of our time
[16:39] notice
[16:40] The Same Spirit of Romans 8 1. now let's
[16:43] just read that again in Romans 8 1 and
[16:46] we'll see what that says
[16:49] all right and not Romans I mean 8 11 I'm
[16:52] sorry and Romans 8 11. but if there's a
[16:58] problem
[16:59] there's a chance but if the spirit of
[17:02] him
[17:03] God the Holy Spirit
[17:05] that raised up Jesus from the dead 12
[17:09] in you
[17:12] oh there you go
[17:15] if the bridegroom
[17:18] Spirit dwells in the bride
[17:21] when God made his first bride through
[17:24] he made the bridegroom first
[17:27] and he was both man and woman in spirit
[17:30] formed him in the dust of the earth and
[17:33] making material
[17:34] and notice when he maybe from Adam he
[17:38] took not another piece of Clayton he
[17:41] took from the same piece of clay
[17:44] same word
[17:45] for Adam was a spoken word
[17:48] you see he took from him and then taken
[17:50] the he had management and feminist
[17:52] spirit and he took the finity spirit
[17:55] away from Adam
[17:57] and placed it in east or still part of
[18:00] Adam's spirit
[18:01] is Adam's flesh then it was Adam's
[18:05] Spirit the dynamic that quickened the
[18:08] mechanics of his body so the bride must
[18:11] also be flesh of his flesh and bone of
[18:16] his bones then how is this mortal flesh
[18:18] go become his flesh
[18:21] how is it done how what is this great
[18:24] transformation notice now if the spirit
[18:29] of him God that raised up Jesus from
[18:33] today and dwell in you he that raised up
[18:37] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[18:40] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[18:43] dwelleth in you
[18:49] to protective ones of course like to see
[18:52] laid upon the Earth the one that has
[18:54] life in a medium or dead
[18:57] they were just rotten seeds
[18:59] the waters and veins burn them out
[19:01] but you know there was a seed laying
[19:03] there ready for life God thought it was
[19:06] laying there
[19:07] now
[19:08] the predestinated ones are the first to
[19:11] be quickened by the Holy Spirit or the
[19:13] Holy Spirit comes
[19:15] to claim its own
[19:21] sure to catch this good
[19:24] now as the sun was sent across the Earth
[19:27] not to bring rocks which are dirt also
[19:30] July
[19:32] it was not to bring all the dirt all
[19:35] right
[19:36] but was the brain Depart of the dirt
[19:38] which
[19:39] was enclosed around a line
[19:43] Not all men will receive Christ
[19:46] oh no
[19:48] but those which God for ordained lies
[19:54] is housed around some of the dirt of the
[19:56] Earth
[19:57] that's when it comes to quickest they're
[19:59] the ones that now that dirt would lay
[20:01] there in the sky oh that those stunts
[20:03] are hot that rocks into those sun so hot
[20:05] but that little seed said that's what
[20:07] I'm looking for
[20:08] to begin to Spring forth to life
[20:11] it quickened that part of the dirt
[20:14] because the sun was sent
[20:18] not to Quicken The Rock
[20:20] not just quicker than Earth but to
[20:23] quickened the life
[20:25] of the sea
[20:28] now the Holy Spirit comes down
[20:31] of course it wasn't that why won't all
[20:33] the people receive it it wasn't sent to
[20:44] you're unbeliever
[20:45] It Don't Mean a Thing to you it wasn't
[20:47] even sent to you
[20:49] it's said to those who will believe
[20:51] the message is to the believer
[20:54] to them to perish is foolish
[20:56] but to them that are in Christ and part
[20:59] of that seedless life
[21:01] my crude little story about the farmer
[21:03] putting the egg on the eagle egg under
[21:06] the Heat
[21:08] that little Eagle was absolutely he was
[21:10] a his odd looking little creature when
[21:12] this uh farmer had did that thing that
[21:15] he did to put this Eagle ache under this
[21:17] old hand and she asked out a funny
[21:20] looking chicken
[21:23] he didn't look like him his feathers
[21:25] wasn't like the rest of them
[21:26] he just
[21:27] in order of a guy and uh all the rest of
[21:30] chickens recognized him an odd fella
[21:33] and
[21:34] the hen went around he didn't even like
[21:36] the diet she would feed me
[21:38] just didn't like that scratch into the
[21:39] Barnyard he didn't have nothing to do
[21:41] with it
[21:41] so he wondered why he had to be the odd
[21:43] one around there
[21:45] this thing and he never tasted anything
[21:47] that you just eat enough to keep him
[21:50] alive because he didn't like the taste
[21:51] of it see of course he wants a chicken
[21:56] and uh the human clock and you know oh
[21:59] days of miracle today there is no such a
[22:02] thing John the church
[22:04] it just didn't hit right it was a little
[22:06] guy
[22:07] so deep part around the hands until one
[22:10] day
[22:12] his Mammy
[22:13] the old Eagle old laid so many eggs
[22:18] and there was one missing
[22:22] she knew that that ego was somewhere
[22:26] so she starts out on the hot party
[22:29] and she circled over the mountains down
[22:31] in the valleys and over and everywhere
[22:33] where he might
[22:35] a bee by this time it's time for you to
[22:38] be born
[22:39] the time frame be hatched out
[22:42] there may be a crow will come in and
[22:44] pick up my egg
[22:45] maybe a vulture
[22:47] I don't know if something picked up my
[22:49] egg
[22:50] but I know that egg is in my mind
[22:57] I got a son somewhere
[23:00] I got the honey
[23:04] God
[23:06] he's that great eagle
[23:07] and his thoughts he nobody to have a
[23:09] church in order to have a people
[23:12] no matter what cuddle them no matter
[23:14] what this hatched out on her
[23:16] he's hurt
[23:18] he's hunting for his own
[23:21] and one day The Story Goes this old
[23:24] eagle flew over the barnyard
[23:27] she's looking everywhere and she found
[23:28] him
[23:29] oh for that Resurrection
[23:32] to recognize that he really was a
[23:34] chicken ass roll
[23:36] he was an eagle
[23:39] and he's always taught to look down
[23:42] look for a bug or something in the
[23:43] barnyard
[23:45] but he heard her scream and said look up
[23:47] this way
[23:49] and he looked to Bobby
[23:51] and there was a creature
[23:53] the 14 deep wings
[23:56] powerful and all the chickens he wanted
[23:58] him behind your heart
[24:00] and claimed him to be her son
[24:04] he said Mama how can he get
[24:07] two jump start flopping your wings or
[24:09] you're an eagle
[24:10] see she knew she had a son somewhere
[24:16] no matter what he's been raised up in
