[47:16] up with us it's good for us to be ahead
[47:18] of them

[48:28] amen let's pray together father in the
[48:33] name of the Lord Jesus we have just read
[48:35] your sacred word
[48:37] many times so God father this this is a
[48:40] very very familiar scripture it it
[48:43] speaks about the cleansing we have in
[48:46] your blood it speaks about the
[48:47] reconciliation brother Branham uses to
[48:50] preach the message or conference with
[48:52] God and Father Lord you calling us to
[48:56] come and reason with you calming and
[48:59] understand Lord come father and have a
[49:02] conversation you want us to come and

[49:38] eat the good of the land
[49:41] let it be tonight
[49:43] let that be our portion tonight father
[49:46] may we never be found in a place of
[49:48] refusing and rebelling
[49:50] no Godfather that's not a spirit that
[49:54] comes from you
[49:55] bless us tonight in Jesus name amen amen
[49:59] the Lord bless you you may have your
[50:01] seat
[50:03] the Lord bless you tonight you may have
[50:05] your seat
[50:07] praise the Lord
[50:08] now Numbers Chapter 19 let's take
[50:11] Numbers Chapter 19. let's go right there
[50:14] Numbers Chapter 19. praise the Lord I'm
[50:17] I'm sure if I if I can get very familiar
[50:20] with this PowerPoint think it might it
[50:22] might make me to be faster
[50:25] Numbers Chapter 19 are we together
[50:28] praise the Lord the Lord speak unto
[50:31] Moses and unto Aaron's saying this is
[50:35] the ordinance of the Lord which the Lord
[50:38] have commanded saying Speak unto the
[50:42] children of Israel that they bring thee
[50:44] a red heifer without spot
[50:48] wherein is no blemish and upon which
[50:52] never came a yoke which means the neck
[50:56] was never time it was never bound to any
[51:00] man or Never Bound to any reason there
[51:03] was never a yoke around the neck of this
[51:06] red heifer and yes I gave her now that's
[51:11] what I want us to to pick up tonight the
[51:14] red heifer is a female
[51:18] animal
[51:20] praise the Lord the rare heifer is very
[51:23] important
[51:25] in in the worship of Israel is very
[51:30] important they need it for every time
[51:32] they go to the to the to to the the
[51:37] Tabernacle uh uh the the sprinkling of
[51:40] the water that the the priests use to to
[51:43] to sanctify the people it comes from the
[51:46] arches of the red heifer
[51:49] praise the Lord
[51:50] amen now what this will teach us in the
[51:55] light of brother Branham or the message
[51:57] of the hour is that how much God kept
[52:01] his bride in Redemption
[52:05] that the red heifer is not a male animal
[52:09] but it's a female animal
[52:13] praise the Lord
[52:15] amen so the red Huffer is a female
[52:18] animal and and and and yes I give her
[52:23] unto Eleazar the priests
[52:25] that he may bring her forth without the
[52:29] camp and one shall sled her before he
[52:33] face and the Eliza the priest
[52:35] shall take of her blood with his finger
[52:39] and sprinkle of her blood directly
[52:42] before the Tabernacle
[52:44] of the congregation seven times now so
[52:48] you know you go through the the message
[52:50] the seven Church ages verbraham types
[52:52] that uh sprinkling of the blood seven
[52:55] times before the Tabernacle how it
[52:58] represented the seven Church ages
[53:00] how God would keep the seven Church ages
[53:03] under the blood you see that's the
[53:05] reason why from every Church age God got
[53:09] a bride
[53:10] it is not only this last Church age even
[53:14] though Luther did not have the fullness
[53:18] of the word but yet he was able to give
[53:20] God a brine
[53:22] praise the Lord amen Paul speaks dead I
[53:26] have exposed you to Christ like a chess
[53:29] virgin why because God honored a shadow
[53:33] of the Tabernacle sprinkle the blood
[53:36] seven times representing that he was
[53:39] going to get a people in every Church
[53:42] age that will be accepted because that's
[53:44] what the blood represents
[53:46] amen the blood represents your
[53:49] acceptance to worship
[53:52] praise the Lord that's the reason why
[53:55] King uh sacrifice was not accepted
[53:58] because uh I mean uh uh
[54:03] without blood you know there's no
[54:06] remission of sin amen and and and and
[54:08] even God for him to for him to bring his
[54:12] children back into his presence Adam and
[54:14] Eve he have to Slit alarm and and get
[54:18] the bloody line and that's when he
[54:20] called Adam Adam come unto me you see so
[54:23] it is the blood that that speaks our
[54:26] acceptance
[54:28] amen and that's the reason why there is
[54:31] no savage brother bottom change is
[54:33] complete without the word because what
[54:36] the word is the blood right
[54:40] praise the Lord the word is the block so
[54:43] every time the word is preached to you
[54:45] is the sprinkling of the blood
[54:49] are we together
[54:52] now so uh uh verse 5 and and one shall
[54:56] burn the halfer in his sight her skin
[54:59] her flesh and her blood her downside
[55:02] shall he burn
[55:04] praise the Lord and the praise shall
[55:08] take a see the world and and hustle
[55:11] and uh uh scarlet and and cast it into
[55:17] the midst of
[55:19] the burning of the Harvard then the
[55:22] praise shall wash his clothes and he
[55:25] shall bath his flesh in water and after
[55:28] all he shall come into the camp and the
[55:32] priests shall be unclean until the
[55:35] evening
[55:36] praise the Lord now so uh uh uh uh okay
[55:41] let me just finish the reading there in
[55:43] his shop and he's uh
[55:47] and he that burned her shall wash his
[55:49] clothes in water and bath his flesh in
[55:53] water and shall be unclean until the
[55:57] evening and the man that is clean Shall
[56:01] Gather up the arches of the Hartford and
[56:05] laid them up without the camp now you
[56:07] see because this animal was a special
[56:11] species
[56:12] they don't always hide it it was not
[56:15] there all the time
[56:17] so when they have when he had an offer
[56:21] there was not that didn't have no spot
[56:25] no blame and that halfway was proving to
[56:28] be the half of a sacrifice when the
[56:32] burning like that they keep the Arches
[56:34] they could keep it for many years
[56:37] because they they don't know when they
[56:39] will have another half for the game
[56:44] so the the red Harper was not just a
[56:47] common animal that you could find any
[56:49] day
[56:52] so that is the reason why uh they have
[56:55] they have been instructed here that they
[56:58] must gather up the arches of the heifer
[57:00] they must lay it
[57:02] and and lay them up with Father cam in a
[57:05] clean Place praise the Lord and it shall
[57:08] be kept for the congregation of the
[57:09] children of Israel for a water of
[57:12] separation
[57:13] it is a purification
[57:17] for sin so the red heifer was a type it
[57:21] represented crisis represented our lord
[57:24] Jesus and like I said it was it was a
[57:27] special species of animal
[57:29] and sometimes uh the red half of may not
[57:32] show up for 10 years
[57:35] or more so uh so the the the the priests
[57:39] have to use those arches sparingly
[57:43] he had to you have to use it you have to
[57:46] manage it
[57:48] because if they go without the red
[57:51] huffle and they don't have arches they
[57:53] will never have service
[57:59] praise the Lord
[58:01] you see that's the reason why the Jews
[58:04] are in in in the situation that they are
[58:06] in now because they can go to the
[58:10] Willing wall and pray
[58:12] but they cannot make sacrifices
[58:18] they cannot make sacrifices they are
[58:20] they are lack of making sacrifice you
[58:23] see that's the reason why all of all are
[58:25] are all through the years the the the
[58:28] the the the Jews the the rabbis they
[58:31] have been looking for the red Hartford
[58:32] they've been looking for one that will
[58:35] meet the qualification here of uh of of
[58:38] uh Numbers Chapter 19.
[58:42] why because
[58:46] their services is not complete without a
[58:49] sacrifice
[58:53] so all the Jews can do now and they
[58:55] suggest go to the Willing Ward and pray
[58:57] they cry to God and they are crying to
[58:59] God and saying Lord uh bring us back the
[59:02] dead of worship bring us back they
[59:04] cannot have this kind of for service we
[59:07] are having
[59:08] they can be taught the word they can
[59:11] read the word they can lend the word
[59:13] but they cannot have service they cannot
[59:17] have Fellowship
[59:18] because you cannot have fellowship with
[59:21] god without the blood yes sir
[59:23] God is not going to come to that service
[59:30] right praise the Lord
[59:32] you see that's the reason why I feel I
[59:35] feel so sorry for a bunch of these
[59:37] Gentiles that don't know their place and
[59:39] they want to become a masonic uh uh
[59:43] Christian
[59:45] they want to take up a a a a a Jewish
[59:49] position
[59:50] you can take a Jewish position because
[59:52] you think that's where the blessing is
[59:55] but you are not in fellowship with God
[59:56] amen amen because according to God's
[1:00:00] calendar until the Gen the days of the
[1:00:03] Gentiles are fulfilled
[1:00:08] then you're going to release back to
[1:00:10] Ezra via red hatford and now they can
[1:00:13] have seven now they can get into the
[1:00:15] congregation of the Lord
[1:00:23] are we together
[1:00:26] now so that's the rare halfer there
[1:00:29] better man would take this year in
[1:00:32] tinky's man filter he said no face in
[1:00:35] Exodus chapter 19 actually Numbers
[1:00:37] Chapter 19 that was what we just read
[1:00:40] that's what he was referring to you
[1:00:42] don't find it in Exodus chapter 19 but
[1:00:44] normal chapter 19 I want you to read it
[1:00:47] when you go home
[1:00:49] when you have more time no face when
[1:00:53] Israel had committed sin first they took
[1:00:57] a red Huffer which had never had a yoke
[1:01:01] on her neck that means she never was
[1:01:06] yoked up with anything
[1:01:09] and she had to be red
[1:01:14] the color red
[1:01:16] is
[1:01:17] an atonement color did you know science
[1:01:21] knows that if you take red and look
[1:01:25] through red
[1:01:27] to Red is white
[1:01:30] praise the Lord so that's why we talk
[1:01:32] about our tough from tonight red to Red
[1:01:34] is white if you look true rare to Red
[1:01:38] it's white look true red and red it's
[1:01:41] white
[1:01:42] he looked through the red blood of the
[1:01:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:46] and our rest sin become as wide as snow
[1:01:51] amen praise the Lord
[1:01:53] amen church amen praise the Lord let's
[1:01:57] respond to the word
[1:01:58] Hallelujah
[1:02:00] when you don't respond to me I'm
[1:02:02] thinking that okay I'm reading something
[1:02:04] and maybe I'm you know how how I do you
[1:02:07] know I'm reading somewhere different and
[1:02:09] everybody says where is he going uh what
[1:02:11] is he reading we don't see what he's
[1:02:13] reading praise the Lord now so and uh uh
[1:02:17] he looked through the red blood of the
[1:02:19] Lord Jesus and our rare sin become as
[1:02:23] wadas no red true red and the half was
[1:02:27] killed in the evening time by the whole
[1:02:30] Congregation of Ezra and there was
[1:02:34] and there was both seven Stripes of her
[1:02:37] blood upon the door where the whole
[1:02:40] congregation had to enter a type of the
[1:02:43] seven Church ages by the blood amen
[1:02:47] praise the Lord
[1:02:49] you see that's the reason why you cannot
[1:02:53] be critical of the messenger of the
[1:02:55] church ages they already had a
[1:02:58] representation before the Tabernacle
[1:03:01] praise the Lord
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:08] and then her blood was taken her body
[1:03:11] was taking sorry and burned it was
[1:03:15] burned with the whole the skin with the
[1:03:19] intestine in her dong everything was
[1:03:22] burned together and it had to be picked
[1:03:25] up by a clean man
[1:03:29] and how tall be put in a clean place
[1:03:33] outside the congregation therefore if
[1:03:36] Israel could only see the type
[1:03:39] this word of God
[1:03:42] must not be handled with dirty hands of
[1:03:47] unbelief
[1:03:50] praise the Lord
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:54] this word of God must not be handled
[1:03:57] uh with Daddy hands of unbelief it got
[1:04:01] to be a clean man
[1:04:03] and if he's clean he had to come through
[1:04:07] God's filter
[1:04:09] and God's filter is his word
[1:04:13] praise the Lord
[1:04:15] amen because uh uh the the the the the
[1:04:18] heifer like like we said was
[1:04:21] representing the word amen so we see
[1:04:25] here
[1:04:26] a God is calling us to a conference he's
[1:04:30] calling us to a time of Fellowship come
[1:04:33] let us reason together praise the Lord
[1:04:35] and and you see he will not call us if
[1:04:38] he had not made provision already
[1:04:41] he have already made provision
[1:04:45] praise the Lord
[1:04:46] amen and whatever we need
[1:04:50] it's not when you ask you already had it
[1:04:53] before you asked
[1:04:55] he already made Provisions so he want us
[1:04:58] to come and just jump in Fellowship you
[1:05:01] see that's the reason why having the
[1:05:03] revelation of debt you don't become so
[1:05:06] so so so so bad about uh uh you know uh
[1:05:11] uh bumping the door or the benches but
[1:05:14] you you just get in the place and and
[1:05:16] learn to worship and thank God because
[1:05:19] whatever we need he has already provided
[1:05:22] amen he's having that provision praise
[1:05:25] the Lord
[1:05:26] if we can just learn what the church
[1:05:29] needs to know if we can just learn to
[1:05:32] Have a Heart of Thanksgiving
[1:05:34] praise the lord we are always sin has
[1:05:38] put us in a reverse State we always want
[1:05:41] to receive before we say thank you
[1:05:44] praise the Lord amen by the original
[1:05:47] state is to say thank you praise the
[1:05:50] Lord so if God can give us a Heart of
[1:05:55] Thanksgiving you wake up in the morning
[1:05:57] and just give God thanks spend time on
[1:05:59] your knee just thanking God and just
[1:06:02] praising God you know what you're doing
[1:06:04] you are believing in his ability to
[1:06:06] provide for you
[1:06:13] Hallelujah
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:18] now so uh talking about God's provision
[1:06:24] talking about God's provision
[1:06:28] there is there is uh there is a judge in
[1:06:32] the Book of Judges
[1:06:37] that you you we you have to understand
[1:06:40] the time of Judges there was no king in
[1:06:42] Israel
[1:06:44] and the Bible says every man did what
[1:06:46] was right in their eyes amen praise the
[1:06:49] Lord
[1:06:50] if you never read the Book of Judges you
[1:06:53] you sure believe that's the time that we
[1:06:55] are living in amen
[1:06:56] in Social law this time praise the Lord
[1:07:00] but you see
[1:07:03] the scripture make us to to realize the
[1:07:07] other
[1:07:08] God
[1:07:09] will will
[1:07:12] raise up a George for the people
[1:07:16] whenever they have gone into adultery
[1:07:19] God will always make provision
[1:07:22] for them
[1:07:24] are we together he will always make
[1:07:27] provision for them
[1:07:30] praise the Lord
[1:07:31] now so uh uh knowing that
[1:07:36] this is what I want for us to see I want
[1:07:38] I want you to see I want us to be able
[1:07:41] to see even though the time of the
[1:07:44] judges
[1:07:46] was a time where there was no prophet
[1:07:49] but yet God was in control
[1:07:55] praise the Lord amen God was in control
[1:08:00] and the provision that God has made
[1:08:03] the provision that he's that he made was
[1:08:07] also
[1:08:09] in control so there were a lot of things
[1:08:11] that were taking place
[1:08:14] on a prophecy
[1:08:17] are we together
[1:08:21] we see how God and and one of the things
[1:08:24] that is also we we talked about this
[1:08:26] before one of the thing that is also
[1:08:29] beautiful in the Book of Judges is that
[1:08:32] this is the time where God was using
[1:08:35] Ordinary People
[1:08:38] praise the Lord God was using ordinary
[1:08:41] people that made themselves available
[1:08:48] he was using ordinary people that made
[1:08:51] himself available
[1:08:54] praise the Lord
[1:08:56] he was just picking people up see how he
[1:08:59] picked up Gideon
[1:09:02] praise the Lord an angel appeared to
[1:09:05] give them the almighty man of Heller
[1:09:08] kitten was looking over his shoulder who
[1:09:10] is he talking to
[1:09:12] but he was the one
[1:09:14] now so if you look here uh uh over in
[1:09:19] Judges chapter 10 just like the way the
[1:09:23] the the uh over there in uh the the
[1:09:26] verse that speaks about Shem guy it was
[1:09:30] just only one verse
[1:09:32] praise the Lord and brother Brown uh uh
[1:09:36] referred to to Shem God uh uh describing
[1:09:40] the time of the judges for us
[1:09:43] so so you will see there there are there
[1:09:46] are few of them over in the Book of
[1:09:48] Judges where you was you you we will
[1:09:50] realize that God you know he he just he
[1:09:53] moved in uh in in a special way and and
[1:09:57] and it's it's all in Prophecy
[1:10:00] so I want for us to look at this uh uh
[1:10:04] this judge that will rise on the scene
[1:10:06] after the time of abimelech there arose
[1:10:09] to defend that's the word I want for us
[1:10:13] to look at that word defend means to
[1:10:17] save
[1:10:18] it means to to uh to deliver
[1:10:23] praise the Lord so there are a rose
[1:10:27] to defend Israel
[1:10:30] Torah
[1:10:33] the son of peel the son of Dodo a man of
[1:10:37] Hezekiah and he dwelled in
[1:10:41] Mount Ephraim
[1:10:45] and he judge Ezra
[1:10:47] 23 years
[1:10:51] praise the Lord
[1:10:53] he judge Israel 23 years as I read that
[1:10:58] today my mind was going all over the
[1:11:01] place but I taught us as well today is
[1:11:03] Wednesday so uh you you do well blotted
[1:11:07] if you just stay right in your line of
[1:11:09] thought amen don't go all over the place
[1:11:12] just stay right here
[1:11:14] here's Josh Ezra for 23 years and died
[1:11:17] and was buried in uh now so you
[1:11:23] will see here that uh what I want for us
[1:11:26] what the underlining word here is that
[1:11:29] there arose to defend
[1:11:33] Israel
[1:11:35] praise the Lord
[1:11:36] that is the underlining word
[1:11:39] because whatever arose to defend Israel
[1:11:43] it has to come from God
[1:11:49] praise the Lord whatever thou will rise
[1:11:52] to your defense
[1:11:57] [Music]
[1:12:01] are we together
[1:12:03] there arose to defend Israel
[1:12:07] Tola
[1:12:08] now
[1:12:10] if you look at this individual his name
[1:12:13] is very interesting
[1:12:16] the name Tola
[1:12:19] it means
[1:12:21] it is it's like a like a warm
[1:12:27] like a my girl
[1:12:30] especially
[1:12:33] and uh
[1:12:36] now we we will get into explaining the
[1:12:39] mall I was able to to go and look uh uh
[1:12:43] what actually I was trying to see if I
[1:12:45] if I would find a video uh just just to
[1:12:50] be able to show you but but we kind of
[1:12:52] make some research to be able to look at
[1:12:54] this and and we will we will we will get
[1:12:57] that get get that to you now so the the
[1:13:00] name Tola
[1:13:03] was was this Josh name
[1:13:07] praise the Lord
[1:13:10] but also when you look into his name you
[1:13:13] realize that there is a whole lot that
[1:13:16] is going on here we see Crimson though
[1:13:18] your same be as Crimson it will be water
[1:13:20] snow we see Scarlet you know we see warm
[1:13:24] and we see color and what what actually
[1:13:27] it is we'll get into the history like I
[1:13:29] said there is there is there is a lot of
[1:13:31] connection here when you when you look
[1:13:33] at it
[1:13:34] but like I said remember there are rules
[1:13:39] air
[1:13:42] a Defender a data Rose
[1:13:46] a Defender want to defend Israel that's
[1:13:49] that is the major thing I want us to
[1:13:51] keep in our mind you know data roles uh
[1:13:54] to defend Israel that's that's what we
[1:13:57] want to keep in our mind but we're
[1:13:59] looking at this guy told that we're
[1:14:00] looking at his name
[1:14:02] and let's go let's go a little bit here
[1:14:06] now
[1:14:09] now so Tola means Scarlet in as much as
[1:14:15] also it means warm
[1:14:18] okay warm like like what you take off of
[1:14:22] the Earth
[1:14:24] and when you look into the scripture
[1:14:28] the from uh from the uh
[1:14:32] you see when you when we go back here
[1:14:34] you see from from that age
[1:14:37] 32 16 that is that is the translation
[1:14:40] that goes back to the uh
[1:14:44] you know when you're looking through the
[1:14:46] the Hebrew the concordance you know so
[1:14:50] that's that's what they are trying to be
[1:14:52] able to bring out of this together for
[1:14:54] us to understand be able to get a
[1:14:56] picture of this so about 38 times the
[1:15:00] same word is translated as Crimson the
[1:15:03] same word that is used as Scarlet you
[1:15:07] know that's the same word that was used
[1:15:09] when uh when Rahab gave those men this
[1:15:12] kind of land you know when they told her
[1:15:14] to put their Scarlet uh uh to her door
[1:15:17] it was the same word that was used when
[1:15:20] uh uh Zora brought his hands out and the
[1:15:24] Scarlet thread was started around his
[1:15:26] hand that was the same word it comes
[1:15:29] from the same background that were
[1:15:30] taller
[1:15:31] but as we will look at the word here
[1:15:34] there are uh I mean scholar telling
[1:15:37] eight times used as Crimson Scarlet dime
[1:15:41] was made from a particular one
[1:15:46] now so
[1:15:48] uh uh
[1:15:50] the die was just like what they were
[1:15:54] used to die a cloth right to change the
[1:15:58] color
[1:16:00] so that died was was taken from a
[1:16:04] particular animal
[1:16:08] praise the Lord
[1:16:10] so you will realize that this the God's
[1:16:14] Redemption story is written all over the
[1:16:17] universe
[1:16:18] he he wrote it he wrote it in in
[1:16:21] everything that he made
[1:16:24] praise the Lord
[1:16:26] because you have to realize that uh uh
[1:16:29] creation was just speaking about
[1:16:32] Redemption Redemption was God's main
[1:16:37] plan
[1:16:39] because there's no way that he would
[1:16:42] dwell with his attributes
[1:16:44] without Redemption
[1:16:46] right
[1:16:48] so in in everything that he created the
[1:16:51] heavens declare the glory of the Lord
[1:16:55] that's Redemption the Sun comes out like
[1:16:58] a man comes out of his chamber
[1:17:01] praise the Lord
[1:17:02] now so yeah this this colored diet was
[1:17:06] was from this particular animal
[1:17:09] and they get they're having all of their
[1:17:11] scientific name here you know uh
[1:17:16] these insects
[1:17:19] Peace attained by uh uh and then uh the
[1:17:23] the the the sock the sub from which they
[1:17:26] prepared a war skill to protect their
[1:17:31] soft body
[1:17:33] the diet is in the scale
[1:17:38] and uh
[1:17:42] the active ingredients
[1:17:44] is uh you see the name right there
[1:17:47] and that is the one of whatever the name
[1:17:51] is I want to get to my place here
[1:17:54] it said yellow red in water and it
[1:17:58] becomes
[1:17:59] their topical Violet red in Asic
[1:18:03] solution praise the Lord
[1:18:06] are you can you cut the light off here
[1:18:09] if
[1:18:11] if is that much better
[1:18:14] okay
[1:18:23] when reproducing the female clam in the
[1:18:26] tree usually
[1:18:28] in in a horn arcs and
[1:18:32] were a bad ax and the lava hash and feel
[1:18:37] on the body of the worm
[1:18:40] it gives its life for its mission
[1:18:46] the Crimson spot is left
[1:18:50] on the branch
[1:18:53] in three days
[1:18:57] praise the Lord
[1:18:58] Amen in three days and if you take that
[1:19:03] that three days now you take the same
[1:19:06] three days in the heart of the Earth
[1:19:09] right
[1:19:10] you take three days for the resurrection
[1:19:13] in three days when the Scarlet spot dry
[1:19:17] out
[1:19:18] it changes to White
[1:19:23] as it flakes off
[1:19:29] praise the Lord
[1:19:31] amen amen now even though is this
[1:19:35] individual name that's his name his
[1:19:37] parent gave him his name I don't think
[1:19:39] they were looking at this animal when
[1:19:41] they gave him their name but you it this
[1:19:45] is just to be able to show us
[1:19:49] how divinely God put the scriptures
[1:19:53] together
[1:19:55] amen is just to be able to show us the
[1:20:00] inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:04] yes a man yeah that is that is that that
[1:20:07] have been raised up in Israel just in a
[1:20:10] time of need
[1:20:13] praise the Lord
[1:20:15] now for Hashem God the Bible say he took
[1:20:18] on us God
[1:20:20] and he went out bed and he killed as
[1:20:23] many Philistines that he could kill
[1:20:25] yeah and the Bible talk about evil the
[1:20:28] left-handed man he took a dig out and
[1:20:30] then he was able to use that to deliver
[1:20:32] Israel the Bible speaks about jail
[1:20:36] she allowed this man coming to a house
[1:20:39] she did not arise him she gave him milk
[1:20:41] and food put him to bed and just put a
[1:20:43] nail in his temper and and nail him to
[1:20:46] death and thou brought a great
[1:20:48] Deliverance
[1:20:49] praise the Lord why because Deborah has
[1:20:53] already prophesied that by the hand of a
[1:20:56] woman
[1:20:57] right we would get the victory
[1:21:00] praise the Lord
[1:21:03] after Gideon his son abimele went and
[1:21:06] slew his 70 Brothers
[1:21:09] and he went over to the Canaanites and
[1:21:11] told them he says and you know I'm your
[1:21:13] brother it's better that you have one
[1:21:15] man ruling over you then you have all of
[1:21:18] these seventy sons of of Gideon
[1:21:20] gerabelle
[1:21:21] praise the Lord he went and killed his
[1:21:24] brother he he influenced the people
[1:21:29] he's in power but one of Gideon's son
[1:21:33] was alive the younger one he prophesied
[1:21:36] he says abimele is going to be like a
[1:21:39] Bramble and he's going to waste fire on
[1:21:41] you and you're going to return fire back
[1:21:43] on him praise the Lord
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:46] but you see with all of that uh when the
[1:21:49] Bible speaks about that uh the Bible
[1:21:51] speaks about a certain woman that took a
[1:21:54] milestone
[1:21:56] was running away she took a mailstone
[1:21:59] and just rolled that Millstone down
[1:22:03] I like the way someone said they give
[1:22:05] him a split headache
[1:22:08] praise the Lord
[1:22:10] he got a split-headed
[1:22:14] because it's just it just entered his
[1:22:16] life it just it just broke his head and
[1:22:20] he died so you see God here using
[1:22:22] Ordinary People right right yes that's
[1:22:26] right amen well no no particular a skill
[1:22:31] set
[1:22:32] and Military skill set uh I mean I mean
[1:22:35] they know how to cook they know how to
[1:22:37] eat but I mean there was just no
[1:22:39] particular skill set that they needed to
[1:22:41] be a deliverer
[1:22:44] praise the Lord
[1:22:46] yeah the strength chart is going to tell
[1:22:48] us about this uh uh uh individual
[1:22:53] and and and and and here the Bible only
[1:22:57] tells us that there arose to defend
[1:23:00] Israel Torah that's all the scripture
[1:23:03] said
[1:23:04] that's all how did he defend it
[1:23:09] so you see almighty God will keep
[1:23:13] the mystery of his defense in his name
[1:23:19] amen how did he defend it
[1:23:23] yeah
[1:23:24] praise the Lord
[1:23:28] The Mystery of the work that he would do
[1:23:33] I mean that is all that is said about
[1:23:35] him that rose up to defend Israel Torah
[1:23:38] that's all that is said about him and
[1:23:41] for 23 years
[1:23:44] so for 23 years he kept peace in the
[1:23:48] land
[1:23:49] for 23 years he judge Israel how did he
[1:23:54] do it yeah
[1:24:00] praise the Lord
[1:24:02] you see how weather whatever he uses and
[1:24:06] and how he did it it does not matter
[1:24:10] right
[1:24:13] praise the Lord
[1:24:14] so God it does not matter what matter to
[1:24:18] God here it is the other he's now going
[1:24:20] to see how Moses gave them a provision
[1:24:27] praise the Lord
[1:24:29] amen how write down from the scripture
[1:24:33] that God
[1:24:35] taught them that uh I mean uh uh uh uh
[1:24:40] without blood there is no uh uh
[1:24:43] remission of sin and there is no worship
[1:24:46] there is not even a sacrifice that will
[1:24:49] be accepted
[1:24:50] praise the Lord
[1:24:52] amen yeah the Bible is not telling us
[1:24:54] that he brought a red heart for this
[1:24:57] it's not telling us anything it's just
[1:24:58] telling us that
[1:25:00] there arose to defend Israel
[1:25:04] Tola
[1:25:08] praise the Lord
[1:25:12] then it Rose
[1:25:15] and what I'm seeing in my mind is that
[1:25:17] God is is is helping us to see an inside
[1:25:23] a talking
[1:25:27] yeah there is something something that
[1:25:30] is that that that will be able to to
[1:25:33] defend Israel judge them for 23 years
[1:25:40] praise the Lord
[1:25:42] now so
[1:25:43] just like I said it is not it is not uh
[1:25:47] uh a specified yet what did he use what
[1:25:50] did he using Hammond he used a Gun
[1:25:52] there's nothing yet is telling us right
[1:25:55] but what is telling us here there arose
[1:25:58] to defend Israel
[1:26:01] and God is their Defender
[1:26:04] are we together
[1:26:06] we are the one that we are we just we
[1:26:09] just becoming a little bit nosy
[1:26:11] praise the Lord because sometimes you
[1:26:14] are reading and you are studying there
[1:26:16] are things that catch your attention and
[1:26:18] you just say well let me look into it a
[1:26:20] little bit and then you start to to look
[1:26:22] in and things start springing up out of
[1:26:25] the Bible or out of the word so that's
[1:26:27] one of these that's one of the situation
[1:26:30] here this guy his name is warm it means
[1:26:33] scarletta and and Crimson is used in
[1:26:36] different parts of the book now we come
[1:26:38] here to realize that uh you know that
[1:26:41] this is an insect
[1:26:43] and this this animal of this uh creature
[1:26:47] who say the other uh and and out of this
[1:26:51] creature will come uh uh uh you know a
[1:26:55] certain diet and they have to wait for
[1:26:57] it the particular season and it goes
[1:27:00] through all of these uh uh uh
[1:27:04] transformation it goes through all of
[1:27:05] these stages in his life and the ones
[1:27:09] the aesthetic you know animals to be
[1:27:11] able to bring us this report they are
[1:27:13] telling us that uh you know during this
[1:27:15] period of time this animal have to stay
[1:27:17] three days you know after it brings out
[1:27:20] this colored color and then after three
[1:27:23] days when he leaves from there you see
[1:27:25] the skull it turns to White
[1:27:29] praise the Lord
[1:27:30] now what would make this
[1:27:33] more interesting now
[1:27:36] in Psalm chapter 22.
[1:27:41] let's go to Psalm chapter 22. I get
[1:27:43] verse 6 up but let's go back and read
[1:27:45] from verse 1.
[1:27:56] that's what it's going to make this
[1:27:58] whole thing interesting it's it's going
[1:28:01] to grab us into the grip of Prophecy
[1:28:05] praise the Lord
[1:28:07] because here is David here on the the
[1:28:12] inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:28:15] he's speaking out the very word the owl
[1:28:18] our Defender will use on cavalry
[1:28:24] hinder
[1:28:26] the one that will defend
[1:28:32] the very words that he will use
[1:28:35] my God my God why have that forsaken me
[1:28:40] why I dial so far from helping me
[1:28:44] and from the words of my rolling oh my
[1:28:47] God I cried
[1:28:49] in the daytime but that year has met and
[1:28:53] in the ninth season and
[1:28:55] I'm not selling
[1:28:59] but Thou Are Holy
[1:29:02] oh thou that inhabited the Praises of
[1:29:05] Ezra
[1:29:07] Our Father trusted in the
[1:29:10] they're trusted and thou bet deliver
[1:29:15] them praise the Lord and I'm telling you
[1:29:18] if we trust in him he will Deliver Us
[1:29:24] praise the Lord
[1:29:26] Hallelujah
[1:29:28] you see David yeah
[1:29:30] going through whatever he was going
[1:29:33] through like you are going through
[1:29:34] whatever you are going through David is
[1:29:37] bringing himself to the place and saying
[1:29:39] oh my God
[1:29:40] I cried in the bed I'm calling upon your
[1:29:44] name in the night but I'm reminding
[1:29:47] myself
[1:29:48] that our fathers did the same cry they
[1:29:52] trusted in you and you delivered them so
[1:29:55] you see David is not it's not casting
[1:29:58] God
[1:29:59] down to say you are not doing anything
[1:30:02] for me
[1:30:03] but David is challenging himself
[1:30:07] praise the Lord
[1:30:09] and the challenge that he's bringing on
[1:30:11] himself is that I need to trust God more
[1:30:14] because there were people that were
[1:30:17] before me that I had need and the
[1:30:20] trusted God and God delivered it no
[1:30:24] matter what I'm going through if the
[1:30:26] Lord can just help me to trust him
[1:30:33] amen
[1:30:35] praise the Lord
[1:30:38] amen thou word trusts it means to be
[1:30:42] cast
[1:30:45] it has a very deep sense
[1:30:49] of
[1:30:50] humbling yourself
[1:30:53] it has a big sense of being humble
[1:31:02] praise the Lord
[1:31:06] it means to cast
[1:31:08] it does not mean to take this and put it
[1:31:12] on the ground
[1:31:13] no
[1:31:15] it means to let go
[1:31:19] it does not mean take it and put it down
[1:31:22] easy
[1:31:24] [Music]
[1:31:25] no no no no no no it means to let go you
[1:31:29] have to cast it
[1:31:35] and you're not turning it up to catch it
[1:31:38] you need to let it go down
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:41] praise the Lord
[1:31:52] oh it has a very it has a very deep
[1:31:55] meaning
[1:31:56] it has a very deep meaning just like I
[1:31:59] was saying on Sunday
[1:32:02] laughs
[1:32:04] we can enjoy the Creation The Works of
[1:32:07] God's hands
[1:32:13] but for God to be able to bring us a
[1:32:16] creation he have to Humble himself
[1:32:20] he has to condescend
[1:32:22] you have to leave the state of being
[1:32:25] Elohim
[1:32:27] or leave the state of being the
[1:32:29] self-existing god
[1:32:33] you have to count the same
[1:32:36] we can praise God and thank God for
[1:32:38] Redemption I'm saved and praise the Lord
[1:32:40] I'm saving uh since anybody ask you to
[1:32:44] tell I'm redeemed
[1:32:46] for Redemption to come to us he had to
[1:32:48] do the same
[1:32:50] The Secret of God
[1:32:53] is not in how much you can memorize
[1:32:56] is in how much
[1:32:59] humble
[1:33:06] when we are humbling ourselves to God's
[1:33:09] word
[1:33:09] and to the word of God then now you are
[1:33:13] trusting God right
[1:33:16] you are not trusting God by reasoning in
[1:33:19] your mind
[1:33:25] Our Father trusted thee that's what
[1:33:27] David said
[1:33:28] yeah
[1:33:30] they trusted and thou deliver
[1:33:36] praise the Lord
[1:33:38] thou deliver them
[1:33:41] praise the Lord
[1:33:44] are we together
[1:33:46] verse 5 they cry unto thee just like I'm
[1:33:50] crying on today
[1:33:54] praise the Lord and you deliver
[1:34:06] so in this psalm
[1:34:08] trust is one of the most online
[1:34:14] subject that's what David is dealing
[1:34:16] with in Psalm 22 yeah
[1:34:19] is Trust
[1:34:24] they cried on today
[1:34:27] and will deliver they trusted thee
[1:34:36] praise the Lord
[1:34:38] so you see when that when Jesus was
[1:34:41] saying my God my God why have Thou
[1:34:44] forsaken me yeah it was more than him
[1:34:47] just being sorry for that he's died no
[1:34:51] right
[1:34:54] the whole phrase an embodied Trust
[1:35:09] are we together
[1:35:15] you love the Lord tonight
[1:35:18] praise the Lord
[1:35:21] they cry on today then we deliver the
[1:35:23] trust that indeed and we are now
[1:35:26] confounded
[1:35:28] and the verse says he says but I am a
[1:35:33] womb
[1:35:38] so if you take it back to the Hebrew
[1:35:40] he's saying I'm taller
[1:35:43] right
