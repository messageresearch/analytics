about a we of mother who to see the the grace of God on your faces this morning let's turn to first king chapter 17 first king chapter 17 praise the Lord I like to go down there to Tennessee that not just to to speak but Bill normally asks me to come speak for him but I like spending time with he and his wife you know brother B he be turning 80 years old this year uh stay preaching and uh the thing about it also he he he lead the Le his son lead the songs and he preached because his song leader uh was his brother Sonny he wanted to be with the Lord and uh so and I think about it I say wow this man almost 80 years old he's doing all of this I should be ashamed of myself amen first king chapter 17 we read from verse 8 first king chapter 17 first king chapter 17 if you look in verse one you will read there the Bible is speaking about Elijah the tshb but we will drop down to verse 8 and the word of the Lord came unto him Elijah saying arise get thee to zarapa which belonged to zom endure there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee praise the Lord the Widow sustaining the voice of Elijah so he arose and went to zarapa and uh when he came to the gate of the city he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there praise the Lord behold the widow woman was there Gathering staks uh in mephis uh uh uh Elijah came to the gate and there was a widow woman there also with her son's sake praise the Lord amen if you know the story about mephis and uh uh uh anti jimama so he arose and went to zapi and and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering stakes and he called to her and said fish me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink drink and as she was going to fishh it he called to her and said bring me I pray the a muscle of bread in their hand and she said as as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barel and a little oil in the Cru and behold I I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and thy son for thus say the Lord God of Israel amen praise the Lord hallelujah don't you love to hear thus say the Lord because thus said the Lord never fail amen praise the Lord how we can hear thus said the Lord every day of our life amen for thus said the Lord God of Israel the Barrow of meal shall not waste neither shall the CW of Earth fell until the day that the Lord send Reign upon the Earth let's turn to Luke chapter 21 there's a story of another widow woman Luke chapter 21 praise the Lord Luke chapter 21 let's read from verse one this is Jesus and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gift into the treasury and he saw as also a certain poor Widow casting in t two much and he said of a truth I said unto you that this poor widow have cast in more than all than they are praise the Lord this poor widow have cast in more than they all for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offering of God but she of her pening have cast in all the living that she had praise the Lord father we want to thank you this morning and Lord we want to join uh the nation we want to join the word that is celebrating mother mother is day father to bring a special honor Lord father that we hold in our hearts to our mama and Lord God we we want to approach your word this morning but we want to look how Lord God uh a certain woman this morning setting mother father Lord God a mother that is Raising her child alone and father we want to just look at that this morning from the scripture and uh uh not only death precious Lord but also Father the Bible says she was a widow her husband is not around Lord and whatever was the second stances we want to draw from your word this morning we be looking at a character of father that you play out in our day Lord the special promise of the spoken word Came Upon so Lord I just I'm just asking for special Grace this morning to just help me Lord father God and as I bring your word father Lord God not to not to just make a performance Lord but father to be able to say something that would be impactful Lord something oh god of internal value something oh God that will bring conviction Lord father something oh God lord Jesus that will help us to think Lord father in a way that we have not considered please come Lord take your word and bless us this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord praise the Lord as I was I was praying there I was thinking about a portion of my my note that I didn't add to this but I don't I hope that the Lord will just be able to help us amen now before I go into the subject I will also want to just do a little bible studies with you there is there is there is uh something that have created a very serious question in my mind for many years for many years and because of that uh I really never took a comfort to speak on tithes and offering praise the Lord because many times you talk about tis and offering the people think you are on a money hunt they think you're about now to start looking into their pocket and want to know what bank account they have you're on the on the money hunt but TI and offering is a Biblical principle amen and it's for our own our own blessing praise the Lord and uh uh but for some reason I I couldn't find the Comfort to speak on TI and offering until the Lord helped me just few years ago to be able to put an understanding to what I will share with you and uh uh I remember a brother called me a brother called me and uh uh let's read let's read U Deuteronomy chapter 26 if you want to turn to your Bible we'll do a little bible study here and then we will go in speaking into the word this morning praise the Lord Deuteronomy chapter 26 Deuteronomy chapter 26 praise the Lord 26 let's read from verse 11 if we reir from uh uh verse 10 and now behold I have I have brought the first fruit of the land which thou oh Lord has given me and thou shall see it before the Lord thou shal set it before the Lord sorry thy God and worship before the Lord thy God now the first fruit was always uh the the your TI and offering okay first fruit was always the TI and offering now so I I just want to build so you can see where I'm going here verse 11 and thou shall rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God have given unto day and unto thy hand thou and the Levites and the strangers that is among you now pay attention now verse 12 when thou H has made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the te year which is the year of tithing and has given it unto the Lite pay attention and has given it unto the levite the stranger the fatherless the Widow that they may eat within in thy Gates and be filled then thou shall say before the Lord thy God I have brought H H I have brought away the Hallow things out of my house and also have given them unto the Levites and unto the strangers and to the fatherless and to the Widow I call him to all the Commandments which thou has commanded me I have not transgress that commandment neither have I forgotten them praise the Lord now so when you look at this scripture closely it speaks of uh when when you are tiing now because of this scripture many people uh uh will you know they will give they will give their ties if they don't belong to a church either to a charity or they will give their Church their tie to uh off finish home or to uh you know uh um uh a final weow and they will give their title I heard someone you know uh uh told me there many years ago and they were pointing me back to the scripture says well you know I give my tie because you know the Bible says that you gave gave my tith to the widows and all that and then I will read something also to you from from uh uh uh question and answer on one of the question and answers on uh on on uh uh someone was asking question on tithe concerning this particular scripture that we have read listen to this tithe is to go to the minister that's right in the Bible they had a box that they set at the door of the Tabernacle when the building this box was was uh a form where the people put in there for the repair you have read it many times in the Old Testament you go in the book of Ezra and all of that you will read that they kept up the building and the things all the repaired of the building was taken care of from that found but the 10th when the 10th the the the Tiding all the tithing went to their priest their Pastor yes tithing are to go for nothing else I know people take their ties and give them to widow woman that's wrong if if you have got anything to give the widow woman give her but don't give her God's money that's not your place that is not yours in the first place praise the Lord now so I couldn't reconcile this with what uh uh uh Moses said in Deuteronomy for many years uh I just couldn't reconcile it so a brother called me one time and then he asked me this definite question he asked me brother one can you help me brother you know I I was thinking about this what what you think about it so uh we talk we talk about it but knowing that I have always had that in the back part of my mind I've always had a question on that in the back part of my mind and you know and and so when he asks me that it now it it just it just exposes me it exposed me to the place where I needed to find an answer so I I just uh I just I just told him I I said I said brother I mean actually the the question you are asking me I have thought about that I really not been able to reconcile this for a long time so you see whenever whenever there comes a scriptural question especially when it gets your attention it's always an opportunity if you really keep it on your mind and you really prayed about it not try to fabricate uh you know fabricate an answer uh uh no you you just prayed about it it is always an opportunity for the Holy Spirit to St to show you more than you have ever saw praise the Lord so uh uh uh I I left it for the long time and one time I was I think I was studying uh I was studying or I was listening to uh something a message or something but I was I was studying and then uh uh the subject came right back to this okay it came to the responsibility of the priesthood the responsibility of the priesthood now you have to realize that God told the children of Israel that the Levites were his amen the Levites never had no physical inheritance no there was no physical inheritance that was given to the Lev now what happened was that if you re remember in Egypt God took the first born of the children of Israel he said every first born that opened the matric of the mother the male was going to be his why because he saved the the the first born of the Hebrews praise the Lord amen save the first born of the Hebrews and the first born of the egyp ipt were slain praise the Lord hallelujah now so uh uh uh uh so God talk the firstborn the firstborn he says all the firstborn he said you have to remember that all the firstborn are mine praise the Lord so right from there you realize that uh uh uh then also God will now uh uh change the the the the firstborn and it will now becomes the Levites now the Levites when when Jacob blessed his children he he uh he gave uh levite his son was giv the priesthood they were the one that were going to self in the priesthood so now the Levites when the when uh when the child was born when when he was the first born you know uh there was something in the Bible called the Redemption money I'm trying to put my my picture together here because there's a place I want to bring you there is something called the Redemption money so the first born Belongs to the Lord but what will happen is there a a parent will take their they are firstborn and go to to the priest and then they will pay a Redemption money and then they will redeem their son back if not the son will be given over to the Lord now you remember that's what uh uh uh Hannah said because Samuel will be the first born that will that will come from her womb if you give him I will give him back to you because the first born Belongs to the Lord amen praise the Lord but so yeah so the the the levite they never had no physical inheritance they were all serving in in the house they were they were all not priests but they were all servants in the house they had different work to do the kites were the people that build the Tabernacle they get another tribe there they were the people that would take care of the things within the Tabernacle and then the ones that were born from uh the the the the family land of Aram they were the one that would be that would do the sacrifices go behind the veil let the candle kill the animal and all of that every one of them have their work praise the Lord amen now so uh because the Levites belong to the Lord and uh uh so they were supposed to benefit from the things that were offered to the Lord are we together amen I want you to grab this picture now so you will see when you read in the scripture when you go go back and you make uh uh a research go in your concordance take your phone or your your your your your iPad or whatever you have just make a Bible search on Widow when you go back you will realize there are many scripture back in the Old Testament where the Bible will says that uh the Bible would talk about the Weedle the the fatherless and the stranger praise the Lord now now the thing that brought stranger into the picture because Israel was a stranger in the land of Egypt so God will always tell them be kind to the stranger to remind yourself that you were a stranger praise the Lord and whether you like it or now we are all strangers and pagin amen praise the Lord unless you are making your home here praise the Lord you can buy your Bering part that's fine glory be to God now so you will see that God took special interest just in the same level where he took an interest in the Levites as being his portion he took an interest in a child that they not have parent praise the Lord he took an interest in a woman that was married and her husband D or a woman that do not have a husband are we together now watch and see where I'm going with this because you will appreciate it praise the Lord amen Leviticus 22 Leviticus 22 you love the Lord Leviticus 22 before we get to Leviticus 22 Exodus 22:22 thou shall not afflect the widow or the fatherless child that's God speaking there in defense of the Widow and the fatherless praise the Lord amen another beautiful thing I saw while I studing this morning I was when I was just looking through some scripture it it came very beautiful I don't know if it will be beautiful to you but it was beautiful to me amen Leviticus chapter 22 if we want to look here closely you will see the Bible says here are we together amen let's read from verse 10 let's read from verse 10 there shall No Stranger eat of the Holy thing a souljourner of the priest or a higher servant shall not eat of the Holy thing but if the priest buy and sold with his money he shall eat of it and he that is born in his house they shall eat of his meat if the priest's daughter if the priest's daughter also be married onto a Strang she shall not eat of an offering of the Holy thing listen to this now but if the priest's daughter be a widow or divorce praise the Lord and have no child now most of the time we frown at that the word divorce looks like a frowning word we frown at it but I I just pray that the Lord will help me let me not let me not go ahead of myself let me not go ahead of myself praise the Lord but let's let's look at this together if the priest's daughter be a widow or a divorce and have no child and is returned unto her father's house as in her youth underline that because it will come very important the next the next uh scripture we will read as in her youth she shall eat of her father's meat what what is her father's meat her father is a priest so she's returned back to to to to the house of her father praise the Lord amen but there shall No Stranger eat thereof now when I read this this morning as I was reading through the different scripture Luke Chapter 2 came to my mind let's go to Luke Chapter 2 like I said we do a little bible studies and then uh I can be able to buy some time and then I'll share with you what we what we want to share with you this morning hope that it's a blessing praise the Lord Luke Chapter 2 if you keep the scripture that we have just read you will appreciate this part of Luke Chapter 2:36 Luke chapter 2 verse 36 the Bible will speak about this woman and it says now there was one Huna a prophetess the daughter of finel of the tribe of AA she she was of a great age and had live with her husband 7even years from her virginity which means she got married to him uh uh after seven years her husband died praise the Lord and she was a widow of about four score and 4 years SC is 20 so false quote is about 84 years so if you if you think about what we read in Leviticus when her husband died she returned back to her father's house praise the Lord because what is happening here this was when Jesus was dedicated when Jesus was born and he was brought to the temple to be dedicated oh Hanah was there in the temple praise the Lord the Bible says she was a prophetess so if if you take what Leviticus says and bring it back to Luke Hannah return back back to the Tabernacle choose not to get married and she stayed there from after that seven years with her husband until she was 84 years praise the Lord amen that really blessed my heart this morning now so the picture here is there there these people the we the the the the the fatherless the offerers we call them and and the stranger they now became in some sense the responsibility of the priest the priest was supposed to take care of them now that is what I was missing the tie do not go directly to the Widow the tide goes to the priest because if you read in Deuteronomy chapter 6 chapter 26 the Bible says when you TI in you're tiing to the levite it first called the levite before it called the Widow and it called the fatherless praise the Lord so the people will bring their tith and offering to the storehouse to to to to the Tabernacle then the Levi will now take of that and now take care of the widows and take care of the offerings and take care of the The Strangers so you see when brother brandham said don't give your your tith to a widow it it means that you are not the one that's supposed to do it it's the responsibility of the priests praise the Lord amen should I should I repeat myself because that's the message that's the only message I'm preaching to you this morning if you didn't get it then service is over praise the Lord amen because the Levites was the heritage of God the fatherless do not have parents to take care of them so God takes responsibility amen the Widow does not have a husband so God takes responsibility and because the priest was his Heritage the priest takes the responsibility to take care of these people you will Now understand why Elijah went to the house of the Widow happy Mother's Day praise the Lord hallelujah happy Mother's Day when the Lord helped me to H understand that it was just like a cold water went over my body so I called the brother back I said brother you won't believe it man I says I says I says I said the Lord being so good and we talk on the phone he said brother one that is nothing but the truth he says that's exactly what it is that is just exactly the way it's supposed to be are we together you have taken all my inspiration praise the Lord are you are you getting the picture amen praise the Lord so you see that thou was the work of the priest he was to take care of these people glory be to God Amen now you you have to think about it you you think about it now you know in in in our word in our time our our tithes and offering is all money in their time it was not money it was all fresh fruit and fresh crops and you know and and livestock and all of that that if the if the priest will be greeted like many of us preachers are greeted he will end up with bunch of rotten fruits around him because how many will you eat before the next Harvest praise the Lord so you see then the priest goes out uh you know he goes and and and and you know they minister to all of these all of these uh uh widows you will see that's the reason why in the New Testament Church uh uh uh the Bible come comes up with uh the the qualification of a widow praise the Lord the New Testament Church comes up with the qualification of a widow because the New Testament Church was now under a New Covenant and and and uh if you if you look there Paul speaks about that you know one that is weedo uh uh that was taken care of by the church is is one that will wash the apostles feet praise the lord it's right there in the book of trothy he says the one that is considered Widow is one that is that will wash the apostles Fe what does that mean which mean that uh she's partaking of communion are we together now so let's go into our message we want to talk about this morning are you are we okay are you okay for me to preach did I create question in your mind amen anybody have a question that they want to ask brother Steve you have a question okay I don't I didn't say you should ask I didn't say you should ask praise the Lord I didn't say you should ask okay just keep your question please don't forget your question praise the Lord please don't forget your question keep your question if it's necessary for me to bring your question back to the church I would do that so just keep your question because you know how is that as soon now he have one you will find yours also as soon as he says once you will find yours your own was not there will just come up praise the Lord and then another person and then another person so if you have questions don't don't forget about your question just write it down and then we will be able to revisit it amen but let's go to our talk this morning I just have a few minutes here and uh uh now we talking about this and and and and that was the thing that kind of caught my attention year you know because if uh if if you remember many years back uh uh what a year or somewhere else I preach a message on why Elijah had to go to a Widow's house and I was I brought that message from another another standpoint than where I'm coming from uh this this morning because what I'm coming from this morning is to be able to show us how God has allowed us to walk on the pages of the Bible praise the Lord amen God has allowed us you know many people don't understand why you know why we we believe what we believe in what we stand for what we stand for and and I tell people uh I mean that this this thing is not an American gospel it's not about one one white man from Kentucky this message is all about fulfilled scripture praise the Lord It's All About fulfilled scripture it's not about a man there's only one man one mediator between man and God that's the man Christ Jesus praise the Lord you see but God by his grace has been able to throw so much light on the word uh that we can say that we are walking where the apostles have thr amen we are walking where the apostles have thr so this morning as we look at uh Elijah the Tish bear we will realize that this was a time a time of farming Elijah has just left the Brooks you have to remember that Elijah has gone down there and he told the king Ahab that there will not be deal neither rain will fall until I call for it amen amen praise the Lord he said that on inspiration not even knowing H H uh uh how the whole thing is going to come to pass praise the Lord but the Bible says that uh James would tell us in the Bible that Elijah prayed earnestly amen Elijah prayed earnestly Jesus himself would testify about that that Elijah prayed earnestly that there should be no rain until he called for it actually it was 3 years and 6 months when you look through the scripture now so when that happened the Lord told Elijah to get by the Brooks The Brooks of charot he was going to send a raven to feel Elijah so God will send that bird the bird will bring some food and and Elijah was there by the Brooks he would eat and the the Brooks was a stream of water he would drink but because the the the the farming has gone on for all of that why the water cease the broke was not running again it dry up and then God will now come and tell Elijah to get up and go to zarapa there is a widow woman there a widow woman praise the Lord amen a widow woman a woman can only be a WI be a woman when her husband passed away praise the lord it's a it's a it's a place in life that uh uh uh it's not one of those things that we desire like a graduation is not one of the things that we desire uh uh like an expectation of a CH but it's one of the things that God in his sovereignty has designed praise the Lord amen and uh and and as we as we look in the word this morning just like a h h h trying to make you to see that God took uh the the the the the fatherless the Widow he took them just as much as he took the Levites as his own praise the Lord it means that God uh they they are special to God why because God is the one that designed their situation praise the Lord he's the one that designed that situation for the child to to lost their parent praise the Lord you will never know what it is until you have to live through it praise the Lord talking to one Young Brother one time he say sir he say he said he say brother one yeah I know what it is for you ministers I said brother you don't know I say yeah I know I know you know my my dad used to be a Min I see you say you're D you were never a minister you don't know you think you know but you don't know praise the Lord you have to wear the shoes to know what it is you are just assuming praise the Lord that's the same way you were assumed for the life of of of an orphan child or you were swn for the life of a of a of a widow woman or a widower a man that lost his wife is God that choose that it's God that designed it and when God design our path in life he makes provision for it praise the Lord he makes provision for it the Apostle Paul will say he don't give us no trial that we cannot be and even in the midst of that he stay made a way of Escape praise the Lord amen it's one of those things that you can never plan for no child plan that I have to make a plan the day I lost my father and my mother no child plan for that even the thought of it is very scary just to think it in your mind is very scary praise the Lord if it is entertaining to you you must get you to the police amen you need help if you are entertaining the thought to get rid of your father and mother we must get you to the police that's what I'm saying so you see there one of these things in life that as life goes on we don't think about it praise the lord we don't think about it I was reading uh the story of uh of John Sheriff if you remember remember his story he's he a man down there in Arizona became a very wealthy man and uh if you if you ever heard the story about the grifted vine the the tree that was bringing different fruits that brother Bram talk about he was the one that planted that he later on became a very wealthy man but this this man he he got his wealth from uh from a scriptural pattern I've learned his dad used to support missionaries and his dad pass away and at one time a missionary came to came to town you know started started work down there and and John being a young boy young young man he went and offered his place to the missionary took his young wife you know and and you know have the missionary to take his little place and start the work and all of that you know and then he went on and and uh took his mother after his dad passed away and he started taking care of his widow mama and uh uh and then uh uh later on as the Lord will remember the kindness of uh of John he uh uh uh he took the thought to start uh uh uh uh helping widows praise the Lord he took a thought to start helping widows and brother B will talk about about how God will bless him and you will never know of what what a millionaire he was it's a special thing it's a very special thing it's a very special thing people all of these uh uh uh uh you know uh uh blessing seeking gospel that we preach you know s seeds and you know do this and and all of that and and we we we have we have uh you know uh make up our own way how how we think that God will bless us and what we need to do and uh you know uh uh uh uh put the cross up and put this up and all of that they are very simple principle in the word of God praise the Lord very very simple principle if God can be able to inspire the heart of a man to be able to tap into death it take God just the snap of a finger to turn your life around and bless you amen it is because we we are we we are trying to come up with our own you know that sometimes it's hard for us to be able to see what we're actually the Lord want us to look but let's look into our scripture now we we we see here now Elijah had to go to this widow woman house and and and we read from the scripture when he went to the widow woman house you have to realize that at first that definitely the woman recognized that this man was a man of God praise the Lord amen and uh uh and Elijah got there and he told the woman the first thing he asked the woman was for the woman to give him water she never you know she never it didn't bother her she you have to realize that this is a time of farming you know nobody is planting there is no Harvest everybody is keeping what they have close to them praise the Lord everybody is keeping what they have close to them we live in a country where there is Surplus amen there is Surplus you can get it anywhere Walmart Target anywhere you can get it so sometimes the picture of that don't become real to us but when you go to places like Gaza this morning where people are running away from their life you go to places like like Ukraine where bumps is going over and you don't have the the freedom to be able to go to work and go to a grocery Center you go into water places you have the picture of what farming is praise the Lord you have a bottle of water you drink it sparingly you just don't drink half you leave you just drink the top and leave the other one standing right out there you go and take another bottle again and drink and leave it standing there why because you have enough this was a time of farming everything they have was precious to them everything they have was uh you know H that they have to use it they have to calculate for this woman to tell Elijah that I only making two sticks I have two sticks just to make enough meal for my son and myself so we can eat and commit our life to God praise the Lord you can tell me that God sent Elijah to that house because of Elijah she only had for she and her son that was their last meal they were going to eat and commit themselves to death so do did they need Elijah or Elijah needed them praise the Lord am I Lord C in the eyes why will he go to the house of a woman that that just have her last she went there because it was his duty as a priest to take care of her praise the Lord he was supposed to take care of her but he will not be a blessing to her on until she realized who that man of God was praise the Lord are we together now so when you look into you you look into the word the the the scripture say he went there and asked the woman fesch me some water to drink it did not trouble her I believe also she didn't had enough water she might have had just few few bottles or few gallons of water that was not so much of a b to her the Bible say she woke up to get the water then he call her back and said woman FES me some meal to eat praise the Lord she says sir what I have is the last I was just about to go and make enough for my son and myself so we can eat and die praise the Lord don't you see God do you see Jehovah Jara she was just to face the last for her to eat and die and Jehovah jarra comes on the scene embodied In the Flesh of an old baldheaded Prophet praise the Lord he comes on the S and says face me first go and do what you are going to do but face me first praise the Lord because thou said the Lord amen that Barrow is not going to go west the oil is not going to go until the f finish praise the Lord hallelujah you see the beauty of it there is that the woman house never turned to a store to a uh uh h h h a storehouse God did not just talk you know bag of flowers all over the place no it was from that very same empty bag she had enough every day when she went there right praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah every day when she went there she had enough to take up the same God that could fill 4,000 people by just taking a lunch from a little boy Jesus Took the little boy lunch he lift it up bless it and then hand it to his disciples when they took one one came back praise the Lord hallelujah to be able to fill 4,000 people the Bible says 4,000 men not even counting the women and children just from five Lo bread and the few pieces of fish that the little boy had God was able to feel the same God that met Abraham on the mountain and said Abraham don't kill your son look behind you there's a ram caught in the tle he was able to provide a ram on the mountain that same God was standing in that widow woman house praise the Lord hallelujah I believe that same God is standing here this morning because he's the same yesterday today and forever are we together because it was his responsibility is honor his Lord he must take care of the Widow he must take care of the oran is honor his Lord he placed that on his Lord that's why Jesus was say His blessings fall upon the just in the unjust is God's responsibility hallelujah it's God's responsibility there are many people wake up this morning they didn't even say the Lord's Prayer but as long as God gave them life in their body is his responsibility to take care of them Hallelujah the only thing that is different is that we appreciate what he's doing for us we realize that it is his birth that we are breathing we realize that he gave us what we have millions that have it they don't realize it the thing is their bank account are we together he says that uh the barrel Will Not Waste the Cru of oil will not go dry until God send rain so God was determined to be able to sustain the Widow you read the scripture the Bible says go to the Widow house I will sustain them but it will be the presence of the prophet in the Widow house that will sustain the Widow house now I came to all of this because there was something that caught my mind also on the story of sister hi white she was a widow I will read a little portion here and I think it will be it will it will help us a little bit to be able to appreciate why God would do certain things why he would choose to do certain things my new ministry let's just pick that up sister hi muscle that was her name she just she she just lost her husband I married a couple some years ago they got two fine children and brother white was killed his own board form him under his tractor marh to death and the little boy had a break and something happened to him until you have been there you will never know what people are going through praise the lord we hear the story about oh I gave you your I gave you your son her wise son G the salvation old the boys they were making fun they were laughing we get into all the drama and not capturing the details praise the Lord amen here's a family a young lady that just got married have two sons praise the Lord making plans to have a happy home and you know grow and and and even watch her sons serving the lord and and and all of that and and and everything happening you know beautiful but something went wrong something went wrong that affected those boys at a young age at the age word the need their there the most praise the Lord father was on the field there on the farm trying to you know make food for his family and harvest you know I mean uh plant and and work and all of that and he had an accident and his own tractor went over him praise the Lord and his son will come meet him in the field dead brother Brandon says something happened to the boy something affected the boy came and met us there lying down blood coming all through his nose his eyes not only is he in a horrible death but he don't have a father he don't have somebody to look up to praise the lord we don't know the story of how the Widow in Zari hman die but we have a case before Us Praise the Lord we don't know what happened but we have a case before us all we can know from that story that she should be a Godly woman because she could identify that that man was a man of God that's what we that's what we know we don't know what was the cause of her husband death but here we have a story of something that happened in our day something that is identified the reason why it's identified because the manifestation of the T po happen in that house are we together praise the Lord and that's what it is people that's what it is children the lossing of a parent can change the life of a child in an instant praise the Lord the lossing of a parent can change the life of a child di in an instant we don't know how blessed we are Hannah what are you doing baby we don't know how blessed we are when we have these things around us you hear many men all through the All Through the Ages they say I can give anything just to spend one more minute with my parent that have gone before the little boy had a break and something happened to him brother wood and I went down there one night and stayed into the night where his mother and an uncle were staying with him praise the Lord hallelujah if you remember the story of uh John the Baptist praise the Lord amen the Bible said John the Baptist was 9 years old when he went into the Wilderness praise the Lord and many of us sometimes we don't put the story together or we don't put the picture together you have to remember that Zacharias and Elizabeth they were of age they were old when they got John so before John would turn nine years Zachariah and Elizabeth have pass John will grow without parents praise the Lord glory be to to God you will see there was some of the thing that kind of affectioned his life he grew with our paren and then when he came to that age there was a lot of mistreatment praise the Lord in one sense you will you will say is that well the spirit of the Lord LED John at 9 years old to go into the Wilderness yeah because he was born to introduce the Messiah God led him that way but you don't have to go and live in the wilderness be eating Locust and be eating grass Apper the Bible says that was what he ate if he had the support he would not go into the Wilderness praise the Lord but because of their resentment you have to realize he's related to this girl that said a virgin visited her so all of these mysterious thing John is H H Zacharias is saying an angel speak to me and and and Mary is say oh an angel met me at the word the whole family were looking like a Fanatics who want to associate with a group of people like that that they cannot explain what they believe praise the Lord and John had to take that path because of the resentment of the society but yet there was a gift over his life that young John had to go into the wilderness to fesh for himself at 9 years old when you cannot even leave your 9 year old child at home by by by himself a 9 years old boy going into the Wilderness to fetch for himself why because there is no father there is no mother but God take care of the orans god it is his responsibility if God laid that path for you he will take care of youen Praise the Lord he will take care of you if you trust in the Lord am he will do everything to get your attention he says when your mother and your father forsake you the Lord will pick you up that's what he said in his word am amen and this was not them forsaken him they were of age they they live their life the Bible says Zacharias was a righteous man Elizabeth was a faithful wife they serve the Lord they die in the Lord God would take care of John sometimes we don't know how good we have it some sometimes we don't know how good we have it we fool around we play around until we don't have it anymore sometimes we don't know how good we have it glory be to God look into the life of this Widow a husband died in the field H his own tractor her sons were affected with that it affected them Propet of God say something came over them and the boy would not be the same he would not be the same he will hit anybody he will hit anything because the one that he l love and he called Daddy is gone it's quiet in here but that's a good quiet that's a good quiet praise the Lord that's a good quiet just like this little little girl story that we all familiar with went to college God makes up with all of her friends there that she will now learn all of the special things of the city and how they dress and how they carry themselves that she will start despising despising her mother back home praise the Lord mama will come to receive her from the train cuz she's coming with all her classy friends she will now want to identify with her poor mother that is burn all over her asham of her mother until there will be a man that knew the story how she had to go into a burning house she had to go into a burning house take the blanket and rub that little baby in in it she would rather burn then for flame to touch that baby praise the Lord but now she's so fancy in her body using all sorts of different cosmetic product to look like the Rich and Famous praise the Lord she want to get into certain class and she coming home and despising Mama do you see how evil the society is the society is crural praise the lord it's crural all the things they feed us with on the Facebook and the Tik Tok and all of that is crural it don't make us to appreciate what we have it fill our mind with fent and we want to be like the Rich and Famous but we can't even appreciate what we have glory be to God are we together I'm running out of time yet try to find a place to close amen hallelujah it's a commandment with promise that's why Paul said in the book of Ephesian children obey your parents he said it's the only commandment with promise and that promise God will spare your life God could spare your life are we together let me let me just hurry up here so yeah so as the story went you know I'm just reading yet but I can tell you what it is and uh so brother M died in on on his own farm and and now the boys are affected about that now you can see what what put them into that pledge amen what put them into that res zenful place they put them in a place where they are you know uh uh uh you know I mean uh uh he it for the child to say you telling me about God where was God when my father died over God he couldn't say my father on the tractor and they go to service time and time and hearing about a supernatural and hearing about uh brother well being raised back to life and hearing all of these things and they think where is God couldn't God be merciful Hallelujah that was just the boys you think about sister her she have her younger sister Edith that was born with a disability she has her poor mother there the man that she love and God married her to take care of her is gone she has to step up she has to step up because she has all of this responsib ibility on her shoulder glory be to God there a lot of things are sometimes the parents goes through Mama goes through before we even come to the place to start understanding and know that they are our mother praise the Lord and then as soon as we go to go to school and get into third grade or we don't even know how to pronounce words good that we start being chicked and think we are smart in all of that she was left with the responsibility to raise this boy take care of her sick sister her poor mama is there all of this is left on her it was not her choice it was what life offer her praise the Lord it was what life offer her but God being gracious praise the Lord she found a way by the grace of God that it did not temper with her faith praise the Lord it did not temper with her faith if there was one thing she could be grateful for she had heard the voice of God in her day if there is one thing that she could be grateful for praise the Lord she came in contact with the message of the hour after she go through a struggling day she will come to the Tabernacle and hear a word being preached and something will encourage her heart and she will go back home with everything that she had to deal with there was one place that she could find Comfort was in the house of God believing God for what what what will come everything is in the hands of God oh praise the Lord glory be to God hallelujah praise the Lord if you were just only realize some of these things people if we would realize some of the things that we are doing some of the things that we have to go through praise the Lord don't worry not preaching on tide and offering it's only only sharing with you I got more understanding now to preach on TI and offering so when I'm coming preaching on TI and offering um I I can back myself up with the scripture amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen you love the Lord am praise the Lord amen amen what a wonderful Jesus we she's going through all of this hoping believing God that God would do something special and her sister EDI will get up from that weed cheer she go service after service if Ed was in service all the time is because hi had to bring her to church the boys were affected and now they are going with the wrong crowd she's not getting the support that she should get from her sons glory be to God I love the Lord Jesus bear with me I'm a little bit tired after three services this week I just got to keep my body together but don't worry I'm good I'm good because the Lord been good to us amen the Lord been good to us praise the Lord but Brown will talk about he says there super anointing sweep over me to tell that she found Grace in the sight of the Lord to tell her to ask whatever she will then you speak it in uh speak speak it by that gift into existence whatever she asks speak it into existence I look at heading the first time it was ever perform on a human being now he's bringing this on his new ministry because he's talking about the the the the the the the the the effect of the tear ped praise the Lord amen the first time it will ever be performed on on a him being and uh uh uh he's he's he's he's bringing the but he's giv us a background and it is the background that I'm that I'm more interested in than the manifestation of the tempo because that we know that we rejoice in but if you appreciate the background amen you appreciate the background you will understand why God had to reward her with that there were many people there were many people there there were many there were many people that were that were that were that were good people this brother I talk about John Cher I mean he was he was one of the person that was sponsoring brother Brandon there were a lot of people that but why why did God choose that it will be in this widow woman house that he will bring down that Supernatural power the first time why they will have to be in the w little woman house there were rich people in the land that Elijah could have gone to their house they would feed him uh three meal in a day praise the Lord they have a big scen television Elijah can just sit back and watch different movie why will God send him to a widow house praise the Lord why because he's the god that reward them that diligently seek him God has a way of rewarding his people he has a way of rewarding the ones that diligently that's what the scripture says not sparingly not Cho choicing when you put God on your own time piece but them that diligently seek him he has a way of rewarding them glory be to God he will bring another part of the story that you will appreciate he will talk about the time word the Tabernacle will be built and brother nil came and and announced uh you know a contribution talking about the building of the new Tabernacle he says I stood back there and I saw had taking money and putting it into the donation he sneaked back and went and talked to brother Nea and realized that she P $50 $50 are we together praise the Lord back in the assistance $50 for a woman that is worth working by watching clothes how much it might have taken her to have save that money but ban says he says no I will not allow her to do that praise the Lord you'll find out why this had to happen in h White House and if you read and just look in between the line in the message you will see why brother bham was so attached to this family and some of the things that were happening we don't have all all all to say to you here but just like what Moses described in the house of uh uh uh he says every time I go hunting I always bring something for hi he will always bring something a meat and Order of that take it to the house so he said I saw her take her $50 she says $50 he said okay I know what I would do and uh uh H uh MAA gave me $20 to go and buy something he said I put the $20 I had two $10 bill he says I would just go buy the house and give it to her because $50 that was too much of her money for that woman too much of a money Jesus said when he looked in the tra treasury he said all of those Rich they put from their riches they took from their riches but the widow she took all she has it's not the amount praise the Lord is not the amount that we gave is the one that we don't give praise the lord it's not what we gave it's what we don't give because you realize that God the money the offering that is collected here we don't ship it to Heaven brother stepen don't PST it to Heaven it's only used to take care of the needs of the church that's what it's used for praise the Lord so without with with your money without your money God will still move his church but beyond what we give is what we don't give because what God really need and your money he needs you he needs you to be on the altar more than your money praise the Lord he needs you to be on he really wants you he could do more with you than your money it's not what we gave it's what we are not giving it's what we keep holding back and see what he says here that's why I said we walking on the path of scripture he said brother Robertson wouldn't take it we only let her give 20 and I said myself when uh she's speaking I give I I will give it back I give back 20 but God said to me in my heart Now by The Vision in my heart when Jesus was standing watching the Widow Port the three penny where there was a thousands of dollars laying what what will you have done I said well if I did be stand turning around says we don't need it sister we got plenty of money now so so what is happening here is that with what he have seen thinking about how he can give this poor woman her money back God is now also dealing with him in the line of scripture praise the Lord amen because even though it's the priest responsibility to take care of the the offering and the widows and the strangers but you have to realize is it's more God responsibility praise the Lord God can take care of them the area that the priest can praise the Lord God can take care of their emotions he can take care of their sanity he can take care of the the place that the priest is just supposed to be a sense of comfort a sense of support praise the Lord if you go to the New Testament you will realize that Jesus rebuked the Pharisees why because they were abusing that Jesus says it it's your responsibility to take the wi he said but what you are doring them you are taking of what they have and you're not giving them anything in return you are just subjecting them to traditions and creeds you are making them two times children of hell because if a weow is coming and taking her weow mind and and some you must be able to give her something that will give her a hope for a resurrection you must give her a gospel that will give her strength to go on day after day are we together so God is dealing with his Prophet yet and says what would you have done if you were there what would you do he said well I will tell her sister we get thousands of dollars we don't need your money he says but Jesus never did that Jesus never did there why what what was God doing God wanted for this man of God to see I'm going to reward that woman praise the Lord all you are doing is just a support but I am her rewarder I'm going to reward her and don't stop her blessing if she's giving all I'm ready to give back to her oh praise the Lord the word is so sweet when you see the word the word of God walking in your day and scripture being made manifest in your day it becomes so sweet to serve the Lord the thing that makes it hard to serve the Lord because we trying to follow scripture of 2,000 years when God is foring that very word in our day glory be to God Amen he says Jesus never Jesus never said it help me God he says as my sovereign jurge God knew that that was down the road for her he said God knew that was down the road for her what is he talking about what was down the road the salvation of her sons God knew that that was down the road so he he never wanted me to stop her blessing he knew what was down the road for her all of this struggle laboring to bring up her boys and and I mean with all of the trouble you know you know what boys is boys we get a lot of trouble amen it was job that says men are a few days amen that what he said he said men men are a few day full of trouble praise the Lord generally me every human being but a more me men men men boys glory be to God full of trouble most of the time is our trouble for ourself are we together and I R my hand in my pocketbook to give her $20 said H he said don't do it then in a few minute when that question was brought up of Jehovah Jara she said that was nothing but the truth can you think about it that was the very time that he wanted to give her the $20 that very day he had two $10 he wanted to slip it and give it to her the Holy Ghost said don't do it praise the Lord because I have a better reward for her glory be to God read read uh uh uh uh first king chapter 17 down after God sustained the the the widow woman and her son the boy let her die if you read the story down the woman say what what what wrong have I done have you come in my house to call all my sin against me that's why Elijah took the boy on his bed and and lied over him and brought the ball back to life now you think about it if Elijah had not gone to the house they were going to eat their last meal and die praise the Lord if Elijah had not gone to that house the boy will have God sake and die so what she sustaining Elijah or Elijah was sustaining her praise the Lord hallelujah glory be to God are we together you love the Lord It's 1:30 where I get you right now I can preach until 5:00 you will never feel hungry I've got you in a channel that I can preach until 5:00 praise the Lord I'm just now making you to realize that the time has gone but the time has gone amen when you see God is God he's not a man God is not a man praise the Lord I mean we just messing with ourself and playing games with ourself and fooding ourself and we think that we are deceiving God but God is God hallelujah praise the Lord I could talk about another weer woman for almost uh close to about 10 years before we got here you and myself this little assembly that we in when we f a spiritual hustle it was a widow Church praise the Lord but the voice of Elijah the message of the hour kept those doors open and that's the strong conviction in my heart let me tell you I have a conviction and my conviction is the kingdom of God the promises of God everything that God would do and he had promised to do the dependency is on God yes praise the Lord amen God don't need me to carry his church on or carry his work on he can do with you or without you that's right praise the Lord amen he can do with you with me or without so in the in the in the Encon of God don't knock your chest don't Knack your chest because behind that chest the heart that beaten is God that started you don't Knack your chest on the things of God because he can do without you and as long as he keep lives in our body and God being our help the voice of Elijah will be sustained in this place I want to invite you to come and help me let's sustain the voice of Elijah because he comes to give us life praise the Lord I'll testify to you I was the first self-appointed Deacon in this church praise the Lord when I came those doors used to be closed everybody is listening to service when I hear that door open back there I go back there brother John asked me one time he said brother one are you the Deacon here I told him I told him I say uh I said no I'm not a deacon but as long as my family is here I have a right to protect this place praise the Lord amen I don't know what I don't do here and it is not no form of bragging it's just to be able to encourage you glory be to God that's my Mother Day's message to you amen Paul says our mother is the New Jerusalem he said we are of all one mother that's that Heavenly Jerusalem praise the Lord that's the one that we y for that's the one that we long for glory be to God Amen is this word that is keeping us is this word that is sustaining us when Moses said Jesus quoted Moses men shall not live by bread alone Jesus was quoting Deuteronomy chapter 8 when he said that when Moses said that he was reminding the children of Israel that it was the word word that sustained our clothes it sustained our shoes 40 years we walk in the wilderness following that word praise the Lord and by God's grace if we follow that word it will sustain us the Lord bless you let's to our feet
