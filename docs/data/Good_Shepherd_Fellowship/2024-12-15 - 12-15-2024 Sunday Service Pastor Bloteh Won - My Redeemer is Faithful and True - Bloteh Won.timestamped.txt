[44:05] the church I won't do it today and uh uh
[44:10] uh just because as you keep thinking of
[44:12] what you want to say more things comes
[44:14] to your mind and some of those things
[44:16] are becoming very very very personal so
[44:19] I'm thinking whether we should just do
[44:22] an offline meeting so we can talk
[44:25] because some of the things that we going
[44:26] to talk is our business
[44:28] amen so uh uh uh we were we were playing

[54:01] we were speaking about the
[54:03] Redeemer in his Redemption you cannot
[54:06] have a Redemption without the Redeemer
[54:10] amen Redemption will never be Carri out
[54:13] without the Redeemer in it the Redeemer
[54:16] has to be in his Redemption praise the
[54:19] Lord God did not made a Plan of
[54:22] Redemption and give it to us for us to
[54:24] carry it out no praise the Lord that's
[54:27] the reason why we cannot save anybody we
[54:30] cannot heal anybody we cannot deliver
[54:32] anybody we can't do that praise the Lord
[54:36] because it's not our work we are only
[54:39] the benefactors of redemption praise the
[54:42] Lord so the one that makes the Plan of
[54:45] Redemption he always comes down to do
[54:50] the work of
[54:51] redemption praise the Lord that's that
[54:54] is that is the reality that we want we
[54:56] want to uh bring to you there cannot be
[55:00] a
[55:00] Redemption no matter what you are
[55:04] wanting to redeem until the Redeemer
[55:07] comes down amen without the Redeemer
[55:11] there will be no Redemption Exodus
[55:13] chapter 3 praise the Lord let's let's
[55:17] read and uh uh
[55:21] uh and and again uh we want to thank you

[55:59] Stars
[56:03] amen praise the Lord so thank you thank
[56:06] you for your prayers amen Exodus chapter
[56:09] 3 now Moses kept the flood of Jetro his
[56:13] father-in-law the priest of Midian and
[56:16] he led the flock to the backside of the
[56:19] desert and came to the Mountain of God
[56:23] even to herob and the angel of the Lord
[56:25] appeared unto him in a flame of
[56:30] fire praise the Lord out in the midst of
[56:35] a bush and he looked and behold the bush
[56:38] burned with fire and the Bush was not
[56:43] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[56:47] aside and see this great sight while the
[56:51] bush is not burned and when the Lord saw
[56:55] that he turned as side to
[56:57] see God called unto him out of the midst
[57:00] of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he
[57:04] said here am
[57:07] I praise the
[57:11] Lord and he said draw not night hither
[57:16] put off thy shoes from of thy feet for
[57:20] the place where on thou standeth is Holy
[57:24] Ground
[57:26] amen
[57:28] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[57:33] father the god of Abraham the god of
[57:37] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[57:41] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[57:45] God and the Lord said I have surely seen
[57:50] the Affliction of my people which are in
[57:53] Egypt and I've have heard their Cry by
[57:55] reason of their Tax Masters for I know
[58:00] their
[58:01] sorrow and I am come down I am come down
[58:07] take off your shoes I am come down
[58:11] praise the Lord I am come down to
[58:14] deliver them out of the hand of the
[58:17] Egyptian and to bring them up out of the
[58:21] land onto a good land and a large onto a
[58:25] land land floing with milk and honey
[58:28] onto the place of the Canaanites the
[58:31] haites the amorites the perizzites the
[58:34] havit and the jebusites praise the Lord
[58:38] amen let's pray together father we just
[58:41] want to thank you we still have the
[58:43] privilege to be able to read from your
[58:46] sacred word oh god father Lord we know
[58:49] the word has been kicked out in many
[58:52] places Lord Jesus and one of these days
[58:54] so father Lord God just like it was in
[58:57] time of old all men will have to give
[59:00] their life for this word while we have
[59:02] the privilege give us the grace oh
[59:04] Father to make the best use oh God
[59:07] because you actually want to write your
[59:09] word on the table of our hearts also we
[59:12] pray to God father this morning we place
[59:14] ourself before you speak to us come out
[59:17] of the pages of your word make yourself
[59:20] rear to us we love you we appreciate you
[59:22] father in Jesus wonderful name we pray
[59:25] amen amen amen the Lord bless you you
[59:28] may have your
[59:30] seat good to see you thank
[59:33] you praise the
[59:35] Lord amen amen
[59:38] amen amen there are two things I want to
[59:42] make an emphasis on and I want us to
[59:44] look at uh very closely as we look at uh
[59:49] as we talk about Redemption this morning
[59:52] and uh uh God told Moses I would just go
[59:56] right into what I want to say I don't
[59:58] know I have much time this
[1:00:00] morning and uh uh he says I I and I am
[1:00:06] come down to deliver them out of the
[1:00:09] hands of the Egyptian god came down and
[1:00:12] and and God really me it when he said he
[1:00:14] have come down praise the Lord
[1:00:18] amen and uh
[1:00:21] uh we want to we want to pay attention
[1:00:24] to this in the scripture we look at few
[1:00:27] places in the scripture yes God taking
[1:00:29] telling Moses take off your
[1:00:32] shoes for the place where you stand it
[1:00:36] is a Holy Ground there is a lot of
[1:00:38] significance there a lot of religion has
[1:00:42] copied that to be able to think that
[1:00:45] going in the presence of the Lord you
[1:00:47] have to take off your shoes now that
[1:00:51] that
[1:00:52] begins the order of
[1:00:54] approach because even in the Tabernacle
[1:00:58] the priest never W
[1:00:59] shoes it was the beginning of the order
[1:01:03] of
[1:01:04] approach when God told Moses take off
[1:01:07] your
[1:01:08] shoes and uh uh but there is there is
[1:01:12] more to that there is more to that that
[1:01:16] we want to look at this morning by the
[1:01:19] help of the Lord is is it's a Redemption
[1:01:23] language retake of your sh choose is a
[1:01:26] Redemption language because we we we saw
[1:01:30] that also in uh uh in the Book of Ruth
[1:01:34] uh uh the king's man kicking off his
[1:01:37] shoes so it's a Redemption language
[1:01:40] that's why we want to look into this
[1:01:42] morning by the help of the Lord but when
[1:01:44] we first spoke on this we we we use uh
[1:01:49] uh uh the exposition of the church ages
[1:01:52] the laa Church age where God's Prophet
[1:01:56] spoke about these things said the
[1:01:59] faithful and Tru
[1:02:02] witness so he was trying to bring a
[1:02:05] sense of faithfulness to us what
[1:02:09] faithfulness is When God Says I Am the
[1:02:13] faithful and Truth
[1:02:15] witness he said now I want to show you
[1:02:20] what I find in the thought of faithful
[1:02:26] the thought of
[1:02:27] faithful when God say he's
[1:02:30] faithful praise the Lord amen we use the
[1:02:35] word are being faithful our faithfulness
[1:02:38] is
[1:02:40] condition men faithfulness is condition
[1:02:44] but God's faithfulness is
[1:02:47] unconditional praise the lord we didn't
[1:02:50] pay money to W be wake up this morning
[1:02:52] he woke us up praise the Lord
[1:02:57] amen and uh uh uh I mean his
[1:03:00] faithfulness is is is uh
[1:03:03] uncondition praise the Lord like we said
[1:03:07] over and over then remind ourself the
[1:03:09] love of God for you and even the Sinners
[1:03:13] on the street is the
[1:03:15] same God don't have partiality in his
[1:03:20] love we change it we condition it praise
[1:03:25] the Lord
[1:03:27] we we have had the opportunity to
[1:03:30] receive his love to believe that he
[1:03:33] loved us and some don't
[1:03:36] believe some look at situation around
[1:03:39] their life and don't
[1:03:41] believe but yet you can you can you can
[1:03:44] still believe in your in your illness or
[1:03:48] in uh uh being broker being in trouble
[1:03:51] you can still believe that God love you
[1:03:56] you can believe it it's the grace that
[1:03:58] been given to
[1:04:01] you so so we make the difference it is
[1:04:04] not God he's not passioned in his love
[1:04:08] the Bible says for God so love the word
[1:04:12] he so L the word the entire
[1:04:14] word are we together so God faithfulness
[1:04:18] is is unconditional and that's what he's
[1:04:21] trying to teach us here I want to show
[1:04:24] you what kind of
[1:04:26] of uh what kind in the thought of
[1:04:29] faithful you know we often talk about
[1:04:32] the great unchanging God whose words
[1:04:35] does not change and when we speak of him
[1:04:38] after that manner we often get a view of
[1:04:42] him that makes him seems very
[1:04:47] impersonal we think about his goodness
[1:04:50] but we take his person out of
[1:04:53] it we say God is
[1:04:56] good we says uh you know uh the Lord is
[1:04:59] good and uh you know he's being so good
[1:05:01] he woke me up this
[1:05:03] morning praise the Lord and many times
[1:05:07] is just a thought in our mind with the
[1:05:10] absent of his
[1:05:15] person we make him very very uh uh uh
[1:05:19] impersonal when when we when we talk
[1:05:21] about his
[1:05:23] greatness but not so
[1:05:26] praise the morning praise the Lord what
[1:05:28] what I I want to say is that this
[1:05:30] morning God in his
[1:05:34] Mercy came
[1:05:36] down and whisper in every one of your
[1:05:38] ears to wake you
[1:05:40] up he took his own precious
[1:05:44] time amen and kiss you on the
[1:05:53] cheek his goodness is is is is not
[1:05:57] without his
[1:06:01] person if God has been good let me tell
[1:06:04] you every mortar every mortar living on
[1:06:09] Earth is giving the opportunity to
[1:06:14] experience God in
[1:06:17] person even the ones that don't believe
[1:06:21] God they will always come back and says
[1:06:24] that uh uh uh uh it has to be God that
[1:06:29] thing that happen it had to be God there
[1:06:32] is something that will happen that will
[1:06:35] bring a
[1:06:37] man very close to the invisible God so
[1:06:42] God goodness and his greatness is not
[1:06:45] without his
[1:06:48] person praise the Lord remember
[1:06:51] Believers he said I will never leave
[1:06:55] leave you that's what he
[1:06:59] said I will never leave you I will not
[1:07:05] forsake
[1:07:08] you that's what he said and he mean
[1:07:14] it God just don't give you Grace and say
[1:07:17] I give you my grace go go no no no no he
[1:07:21] gave Grace and he follow his
[1:07:24] grace when he gave Mercy he follow his
[1:07:32] mercy so what what what the prophet of
[1:07:35] God is trying to do is to is to make
[1:07:39] us be a word to conscientise us of his
[1:07:44] presence of his
[1:07:48] presence are we together
[1:07:57] and when we speak of him after that
[1:07:59] manner we often get a view of him that
[1:08:02] makes him seem very
[1:08:04] impersonal it is as though God made the
[1:08:07] whole universe and all the laws that
[1:08:10] pertain to it and then stood back and
[1:08:14] became and became a great imp personal
[1:08:19] God praise the Lord he just put the
[1:08:21] moons the star put everything dead and
[1:08:23] then he just he just sit on his throne
[1:08:25] and for his hands
[1:08:31] no no you see that's that like I said on
[1:08:35] Wednesday night that is the
[1:08:38] Paradox the Paradox is not the
[1:08:42] result the Paradox is the intelligence
[1:08:46] that brings the
[1:08:48] result how he manage
[1:08:51] it amen
[1:08:55] the intelligence behind it that brings
[1:08:59] the result is the Paradox it's not the
[1:09:04] result are we
[1:09:10] together let's just Fellowship around
[1:09:13] this a little bit it is as though God
[1:09:15] made a way of salvation for lost
[1:09:20] mankind that way being the cross and
[1:09:24] then when the death of Christ has has
[1:09:27] atoned for sins and his resurrection
[1:09:30] gave us an open door to him God just F
[1:09:34] his arm and sto back you know he paid
[1:09:37] the price it's almost like okay I
[1:09:40] finished paying the price for you I've
[1:09:42] done what I'm supposed to do I leave it
[1:09:44] with you
[1:09:46] nope you cannot take a redeemer out of
[1:09:50] redemption you don't have
[1:09:53] Redemption you don't have Redemption
[1:09:56] you can't take the Savior out of
[1:09:58] Salvation you don't have
[1:10:00] salvation you cannot take the Healer out
[1:10:02] of healing you don't have
[1:10:05] healing for you to have healing the
[1:10:08] Healer has to be there for you to be
[1:10:11] saved the Savior have to be on the scene
[1:10:14] for you to be redeemed the Redeemer have
[1:10:16] to step
[1:10:19] down are we
[1:10:22] together praise the Lord
[1:10:28] that's the picture that's the picture we
[1:10:30] want to we we we trying to set for this
[1:10:32] morning and uh uh so you can grab it
[1:10:36] because that is the thing that is
[1:10:38] weakening our faith that is the thing
[1:10:41] that is killing the church because the
[1:10:44] church has put God behind the clouds his
[1:10:46] way in heaven we are here to
[1:10:49] manage amen we here to make the rules we
[1:10:53] here to tell you how you should do it
[1:10:57] when the first man was lost God never
[1:10:59] sent an angel it was God that was going
[1:11:03] in the garden Adam Adam where are you he
[1:11:05] didn't send an angel If He Did It for
[1:11:08] the first man he would do it for every
[1:11:10] lost son and daughter of
[1:11:14] God praise the
[1:11:18] Lord he might borrow some body to
[1:11:22] use but if you will ever come out safe
[1:11:25] it will have to be God on the
[1:11:31] same are we
[1:11:39] together even for his hand and just
[1:11:42] stood back it is it is as if we we we
[1:11:47] measure in believing in a great Creator
[1:11:50] who having who having created lost
[1:11:53] personal interest in his creat creation
[1:11:56] because that's what the atheist will say
[1:11:58] where is God all of these things are
[1:11:59] happening where is God praise the Lord
[1:12:03] you see the reason why it don't trouble
[1:12:05] us because he told us in his word it was
[1:12:07] going to
[1:12:09] happen praise the
[1:12:11] Lord if we if you are reading the word
[1:12:14] you will not be troubled about the wars
[1:12:16] and the and the earthquakes and
[1:12:18] everything that is happening because he
[1:12:19] said it in his word he said it hundreds
[1:12:22] of years
[1:12:27] praise the Lord that that shows that
[1:12:29] he's in
[1:12:32] control it shows that he's in
[1:12:36] control if I tell you when you get to
[1:12:39] your house when you leave this church
[1:12:41] this morning you get to your house you
[1:12:43] will see everything in your house parked
[1:12:45] before on the
[1:12:47] street you never left it like that and I
[1:12:51] tell you that by the end of this service
[1:12:53] before you get to your house you see a
[1:12:54] lot of people crying around your things
[1:12:56] they are doing uh uh uh garage
[1:13:01] sale praise the Lord amen and you get to
[1:13:05] your house you see them having garage
[1:13:11] sale you realized that there is an
[1:13:15] intelligence that is greater than you
[1:13:17] because you never left your home like
[1:13:20] that are we together
[1:13:25] so uh I mean uh uh uh uh let's let's
[1:13:28] let's not feed into the into the thought
[1:13:30] of the uh agnostics and in eight years
[1:13:33] why are these things happening why are
[1:13:35] these things when you if you are in the
[1:13:37] word you will
[1:13:39] know praise the Lord and because he said
[1:13:50] it are we together
[1:13:55] now I say that is how too many people
[1:13:58] are able to think but that is wrong
[1:14:03] thinking for God is governing in the
[1:14:06] Affairs of men Right Now Praise the Lord
[1:14:11] he's governing in the Affairs of men
[1:14:15] right now by his great intelligence he
[1:14:19] has set your heartbeat your paws by his
[1:14:24] great intelligence
[1:14:25] whatever you ate this morning he has
[1:14:28] designed your body inner system to break
[1:14:31] their food and distribute energy to your
[1:14:34] brain your hand everything so he's
[1:14:37] govering in the Affairs of men Right
[1:14:48] Now Praise the
[1:14:52] Lord if it gets so dark
[1:14:55] it gets black it becomes so
[1:14:59] Troublesome and if your faith can see
[1:15:01] God you must believe he's
[1:15:04] there praise the Lord you must believe
[1:15:08] that he's there and he's in
[1:15:14] control love the
[1:15:19] Lord for God is governing in the Affairs
[1:15:21] of men right now he's both Creator and
[1:15:25] and
[1:15:26] sustainer amen he's both Creator and
[1:15:30] sustainer God told
[1:15:32] Moses take off your
[1:15:34] shoes for the place where you stand on
[1:15:38] is a Holy Ground you know over and over
[1:15:41] uh uh uh brother bam used this and it
[1:15:43] sound like a
[1:15:45] joke but when you look at it really you
[1:15:48] realize it's not a joke listen to this
[1:15:51] he said what is in your hand he says God
[1:15:53] spoke to him and said Moses take off
[1:15:55] your shoes for the ground you are
[1:15:58] standing is a Holy Ground now what if
[1:16:02] Moses said Lord just a little bit of
[1:16:05] trouble for me to do that so I would
[1:16:09] just take off my heart God didn't say
[1:16:11] take off your heart he said take off
[1:16:14] your
[1:16:15] shoes praise the
[1:16:17] Lord
[1:16:23] amen you realize that when you look into
[1:16:26] that you will see that God wanted to
[1:16:30] bring Moses in contact with his
[1:16:35] reality praise the Lord amen he wanted
[1:16:39] to bring Moses in contact with his
[1:16:43] reality the Earth is your reality that's
[1:16:46] where your body is taken
[1:16:52] from are we together
[1:16:56] we will deal with that more but then
[1:16:58] just like I said it's a Redemption
[1:17:02] language it's a Redemption language and
[1:17:05] is going to set the order of approach to
[1:17:12] worship what was the language what was
[1:17:15] God telling
[1:17:19] Moses God was telling
[1:17:22] Moses I'm going to step in your
[1:17:27] shoes praise the
[1:17:29] Lord take off your shoes I'm going to
[1:17:33] step in your shoes I'm going to come
[1:17:35] down that's what he said and I will step
[1:17:38] in your
[1:17:41] shoes that's what you said when you said
[1:17:43] I mean you're not in my shoes you use
[1:17:45] that all the time you tell somebody
[1:17:48] you're not in my
[1:17:50] shoes it does not mean that the person
[1:17:53] is wearing your shoes
[1:17:55] it means that you are not feeling what
[1:17:57] I'm
[1:17:58] feeling you don't know what I'm going
[1:18:00] through so it's a Redemption
[1:18:06] language when he told Moses take off
[1:18:08] your
[1:18:10] shoes I'm going to come
[1:18:16] down are we
[1:18:19] together now so you will
[1:18:22] realize that uh
[1:18:29] uh
[1:18:31] God was about to step in his place he
[1:18:34] was about to step in his shoes that word
[1:18:38] shoes could mean position it could mean
[1:18:42] place it could mean a
[1:18:44] condition amen when you tell somebody
[1:18:48] you're not in my shoes it could mean a
[1:18:50] condition I'm going through a certain
[1:18:53] condition so God was going to step into
[1:18:57] Moses
[1:18:58] shoes why because he said I have heard
[1:19:02] the
[1:19:03] Cry of the
[1:19:05] people amen I have felt their
[1:19:10] Affliction and I'm come
[1:19:13] down praise the Lord so God was about to
[1:19:17] be identify with their
[1:19:20] reality he was about to identify himself
[1:19:24] with the things that they were going
[1:19:26] through so he said I am calm
[1:19:31] down but if I come down I need a shoes
[1:19:35] to
[1:19:38] wear praise the Lord Egypt is too dead
[1:19:42] for my feet I need a shoes to wear so
[1:19:46] Moses take off your
[1:19:49] shoes glory be to God you love the Lord
[1:19:54] hey
[1:19:57] amen they set they set uh uh a symbol
[1:20:01] for
[1:20:02] calling you realize you go over in
[1:20:05] Leviticus chapter 14 you will see that
[1:20:08] uh when the priest will make an offering
[1:20:11] for sin there were two things he would
[1:20:13] use the blood and the oil he was
[1:20:15] supposed to anoint his eyes the things
[1:20:18] he will see he was supposed to anoint
[1:20:21] his Tong that representing the things he
[1:20:23] would touch and you are also supposed to
[1:20:26] anoint his big toe on the right
[1:20:29] foot praise the Lord stif fireing the
[1:20:32] place that he will step are we together
[1:20:36] amen he canot foret an other in the
[1:20:41] sense Israel approached that way not
[1:20:44] having the full Revelation every time
[1:20:47] the priest comes to the the the the the
[1:20:51] the the temple or the Tabernacle he go
[1:20:54] to the lav and he wash his feet and he
[1:20:57] take off his Sanders and he goes now the
[1:21:01] precedent that God was setting for the
[1:21:04] Tabernacle is that he was the one making
[1:21:08] offering to
[1:21:12] himself praise the
[1:21:14] Lord he was the one making offering to
[1:21:20] himself praise the Lord amen God has to
[1:21:25] believe his word in
[1:21:29] you he has to praise himself in
[1:21:32] you if it is left with you alone you
[1:21:35] will just dance to the music and satisfy
[1:21:38] your emotion but when it comes to
[1:21:41] worship the spirit of God has to drop
[1:21:43] down on you to bring Praises back to
[1:21:47] God he has to step in your shoes for you
[1:21:50] to bring true worship
[1:21:57] God was setting the precedent that he
[1:22:00] was the one because this man that is a
[1:22:03] priest is as much as a sinner like all
[1:22:07] the people that that were outside of the
[1:22:10] Tabernacle so how can a sinner stand in
[1:22:13] a place for for
[1:22:19] Sinners so he has to take off his shoes
[1:22:24] signifying that almighty God was going
[1:22:28] to take the offering of the
[1:22:30] people and use a man and present it to
[1:22:38] himself that's why he told Mary don't
[1:22:41] touch
[1:22:42] me I have to go and present myself to
[1:22:45] the father
[1:22:55] praise the
[1:22:58] Lord he was set
[1:23:01] in and
[1:23:04] other do you
[1:23:07] realize one of the most powerful
[1:23:12] significance in the 40 days walk in the
[1:23:16] wilderness the Bible
[1:23:18] says their
[1:23:20] shoes never were out
[1:23:25] 40 years using the same
[1:23:31] Sanders speaking of divine
[1:23:37] provision Divine
[1:23:44] provision praise the Lord
[1:23:54] are you seeing the
[1:24:00] picture for I am come down I've heard
[1:24:04] the Affliction of my people and I am
[1:24:07] come down to deliver them that's what he
[1:24:13] said but he's going to set something
[1:24:16] very
[1:24:18] symbolic that would be
[1:24:21] overlooked praise the Lord
[1:24:25] and that's why brother brand says God
[1:24:27] never told Moses give me your heart
[1:24:29] because it could speak of
[1:24:31] intelligence it could speak of your
[1:24:35] smartness but he took the most least
[1:24:41] place the place that contacts you with
[1:24:44] your
[1:24:52] reality praise the Lord
[1:24:56] it was also
[1:24:58] represented o uh uh uh in in the Book of
[1:25:01] Ruth that was boas's marriage
[1:25:06] license amen that was his marriage
[1:25:10] license that the man that was the
[1:25:13] most nearest
[1:25:15] King had to kick off his
[1:25:19] shoes when he kick off his shoes what
[1:25:21] does that mean boa will step in his
[1:25:23] shoes
[1:25:28] because he was the man that was more
[1:25:31] close to redeem now I'm in
[1:25:35] Ruth and because he was now worthy to do
[1:25:38] it he has to remove his shoes
[1:25:42] publicly to show that there is another
[1:25:45] man that is stepping in his
[1:25:51] shoes praise the Lord I believe that
[1:25:54] that's what almighty God did when when
[1:25:56] when he met Moses he the Bible says the
[1:25:59] angel of the Lord get on the bush and it
[1:26:02] it just created a blazing fire and and
[1:26:05] and you know and he called all the
[1:26:07] Heavenly all the Angels were looking
[1:26:10] around and saying what what what is he
[1:26:12] going to
[1:26:14] do what a
[1:26:18] sight and he got
[1:26:22] Moses think about it you just think
[1:26:24] about it the Bible says he called Moses
[1:26:28] and said Moses
[1:26:30] Moses and he says yeah I Am
[1:26:34] Lord how did he
[1:26:44] know are we together
[1:26:56] oh people there are a lot of
[1:26:58] things there are a lot of
[1:27:03] things in our
[1:27:12] reality that was boas's marriage
[1:27:21] license John the Baptist used
[1:27:25] dead he says I'm not even
[1:27:28] walking to remove the lashes from his
[1:27:31] Sanders his
[1:27:33] shoes describing the kind of a m uh uh
[1:27:37] uh uh Ministry he had that's why he says
[1:27:39] I must decrease for him to
[1:27:47] increase Jesus Will simplify
[1:27:51] that in St John 13 when he would give
[1:27:54] get on his
[1:27:55] knees and wash the disciples
[1:27:59] feet he said what I do to you now you
[1:28:01] don't
[1:28:05] know praise the Lord
[1:28:09] amen he will get down on his
[1:28:13] knees get himself with a
[1:28:16] towel and he will grab their
[1:28:19] feet and he will wash their feet
[1:28:26] it's a Redemption
[1:28:31] language you have to remember
[1:28:36] that praise the
[1:28:48] Lord you love the Lord
[1:29:16] so you will see that over over
[1:29:20] time because that was done
[1:29:24] uh uh uh Moses was the one that
[1:29:27] experienced
[1:29:29] that I believe with such an experience
[1:29:32] it left it left so much impression on
[1:29:35] him that every time he would talk to God
[1:29:38] he would take off his shoes it became a
[1:29:41] kind of a h order a kind of approach to
[1:29:45] God and and and and you see and
[1:29:47] sometimes that's the way it is God will
[1:29:49] do some things and then uh uh we will we
[1:29:52] will partially understand understand it
[1:29:55] and then we would take it to be a statue
[1:29:57] or we take it to be an other but he
[1:30:00] means more to that amen so you see over
[1:30:03] and over like I said it was done in the
[1:30:06] Tabernacle you can you can look at a
[1:30:08] verse here that 2 Samuel chapter 15:30
[1:30:12] you look at that uh the Bible says and
[1:30:14] David went
[1:30:15] up by the as of the Mount Olive and he
[1:30:19] wept as he went up and uh and had had
[1:30:24] his head covered and he went up
[1:30:28] barefooted and all the people was with
[1:30:30] him covered their head and and and you
[1:30:33] and you know and they were
[1:30:36] weeping and so that became a kind of
[1:30:39] approach uh uh to worship you know uh
[1:30:42] and uh and even and even uh uh uh there
[1:30:46] were other other group of people that
[1:30:48] take that the Muslims take that as
[1:30:50] worship and um I think the the Buddhist
[1:30:53] different people you know they take
[1:30:55] coming into uh a sacri place or coming
[1:30:58] into a place of worship you know uh you
[1:31:01] have to take off your shoes you know uh
[1:31:03] uh and and and uh uh uh uh most people
[1:31:07] especially uh a little bit that I I Year
[1:31:10] from the Muslim why they do that they
[1:31:11] said because your feet takes all the
[1:31:13] dirt you know your feet is the most
[1:31:15] deadest thing because they walk on the
[1:31:17] Earth but that's your reality you know
[1:31:20] if they will only realize that that is
[1:31:22] your reality so I mean over and over you
[1:31:24] see that through the
[1:31:26] scripture you see that through the
[1:31:28] scripture we can run you through here
[1:31:30] but uh it will it will take us a lot of
[1:31:32] lot of our time and uh uh and and take
[1:31:35] us away from what we want to bring to
[1:31:37] you so God didn't say take off your your
[1:31:40] your heart you know uh uh not our
[1:31:43] knowledge not our smartness he you know
[1:31:46] he want to bring us in contact with our
[1:31:48] reality amen you want to bring us in
[1:31:51] contact with our reality
[1:31:54] that's where we are taken from and
[1:31:56] that's where we will return one of these
[1:31:58] days praise the Lord amen may God just
[1:32:03] help us this morning amen so you see the
[1:32:06] uh uh uh that's that that's that's a
[1:32:09] Redemption language and uh uh uh and God
[1:32:12] is stepping down as as we are talking
[1:32:15] about the Redeemer uh in his Redemption
[1:32:18] you know well here is the people that
[1:32:21] God promised the Seed of Abraham that he
[1:32:24] promised Abraham that he will come down
[1:32:26] and deliver them remember Genesis 15 he
[1:32:29] make that Covenant to Abraham he says
[1:32:32] your sea was so John in a strange L but
[1:32:34] I will deliver them just at that time he
[1:32:37] setting the sin for
[1:32:40] Redemption he's setting the sin for
[1:32:43] Redemption even in the even in the the
[1:32:46] the the the the the Bible there if you
[1:32:49] were to redeem a land or you were to
[1:32:52] redeem uh your brother or you know you
[1:32:55] you you have to present yourself the
[1:32:57] nearest Kings have to be there you don't
[1:33:00] send somebody else to go and do
[1:33:02] Redemption for you no they want to know
[1:33:05] how are you related to this
[1:33:08] person so the want doing Redemption you
[1:33:11] have to be
[1:33:13] there praise the
[1:33:15] Lord
[1:33:18] amen you have to be there brother
[1:33:21] desimon amen yeah you have to go to
[1:33:24] Ghana you have to be
[1:33:30] there praise the
[1:33:32] Lord can you
[1:33:35] imagine a man going to get married he
[1:33:37] says where where is the husband no I
[1:33:39] came to represent
[1:33:45] him no I'm here to represent the husband
[1:33:48] I'm here to to take the wife and carry
[1:33:50] her
[1:33:54] praise the
[1:33:57] Lord now so you will see uh uh uh
[1:34:05] uh you will see that uh it's a very
[1:34:10] strong Redemption
[1:34:11] language very very strong Redemption
[1:34:16] language I know as I just T talk about
[1:34:19] this uh uh Isaac and Ela pop into my
[1:34:22] head and uh and and there is something
[1:34:26] also that connects with that that many
[1:34:29] times our eye runs
[1:34:31] over but since it comes to my mind we
[1:34:34] will look at it a little bit amen it's
[1:34:36] not part of my my my thought here you
[1:34:39] have to remember now Abraham sending out
[1:34:42] his
[1:34:43] seven amen Abraham sending out his seven
[1:34:47] and the Bible says that uh uh this El
[1:34:51] eel was born in the House of
[1:34:56] Abraham okay he was not Abraham's son
[1:34:59] but he was born in the house of Abraham
[1:35:02] you remember God and Abraham
[1:35:04] conversation Abraham was even presenting
[1:35:07] Ela to God that this is one that is born
[1:35:10] in my house you know he can he can be my
[1:35:13] hairs no God said no you will have a
[1:35:17] son praise the Lord now see where is the
[1:35:20] connection now God Abraham had to SW
[1:35:24] I mean Ela had to put his his hands
[1:35:27] under the ti of Abraham and he had to
[1:35:30] swear okay and then when he did that he
[1:35:35] was he was he was representing the
[1:35:38] father he was representing but there is
[1:35:41] another thing also that uh uh uh that I
[1:35:46] want for us to pay attention to and
[1:35:52] uh are we
[1:35:54] together let's let's go over to
[1:36:03] Genesis let's go over to
[1:36:10] Genesis if you want to see the picture
[1:36:14] clearly you we will have to begin from
[1:36:18] Genesis chapter
[1:36:22] 24 we have to begin from Genesis chapter
[1:36:28] 24 and where the picture comes in with
[1:36:31] Genesis 24 is
[1:36:34] there
[1:36:38] uh praise the
[1:36:44] Lord it looks like it looks like when I
[1:36:47] was praying I was praying for brother
[1:36:49] Jordan and his family and they riding
[1:36:52] church so it looks like uh for once I
[1:36:55] thought we were back in the book of Acts
[1:36:57] having a prayer meeting praying for
[1:36:59] Peter and he standing behind the
[1:37:07] door I'm trying to get away from it it
[1:37:09] keeps coming to my mind so I just have
[1:37:11] to say it now so if if you look in in
[1:37:14] the in that you will realize let me let
[1:37:16] me bring something to your mind
[1:37:19] here God is the author of this book
[1:37:24] praise the Lord he's the author of this
[1:37:27] book and he said it in in a divine order
[1:37:32] like Jesus said the scripture cannot be
[1:37:34] broken praise the Lord now
[1:37:38] remember when Abraham took El I mean
[1:37:42] took Isaac to the
[1:37:45] mountain when he took Isaac up to the
[1:37:48] mountain to be able to sacrifice Isaac
[1:37:52] on the order of
[1:37:54] God the Bible says that to
[1:37:59] Abraham Isaac was
[1:38:02] dead okay to Abraham Isaac was
[1:38:09] dead the Bible say he offer him as one
[1:38:13] that was
[1:38:15] dead now so when he went up to the
[1:38:20] mountain and God held Abraham
[1:38:23] him and show him a
[1:38:27] ram that became a
[1:38:32] resurrection when a when Isaac came from
[1:38:35] on the altar to sit up and stand up
[1:38:38] there was a
[1:38:40] resurrection praise the
[1:38:45] lord we don't have time to go through
[1:38:48] all of that but what I want to grab your
[1:38:50] mind to is that from from that time the
[1:38:55] Bible did not mention Isaac it did not
[1:38:59] talk about Isaac again until
[1:39:06] Rebecca praise the Lord amen because
[1:39:10] what took place there was a
[1:39:14] prophecy it was a prophecy
[1:39:18] life God prophesied he demonstrated life
[1:39:24] that after the death buried and
[1:39:27] Resurrection Christ will not appear
[1:39:29] again until he appear with his
[1:39:35] bride praise the Lord are we
[1:39:39] together amen
[1:39:45] so God has to make a provision
[1:39:49] here and if you even realize you will
[1:39:52] see that
[1:39:54] when you read the scripture the Bible
[1:39:56] did not call the name of elaser when he
[1:40:00] went to find Rebecca his name is not
[1:40:05] mentioned just go and and read it why
[1:40:08] because the Bible said Jesus said when
[1:40:11] the comforter shall come he will not
[1:40:13] speak of
[1:40:17] himself so El name is now mentioned why
[1:40:21] because it's all prophecy
[1:40:28] so God designed that he plac those
[1:40:30] things
[1:40:34] there are we
[1:40:36] together
[1:40:39] okay we together let's continue
[1:40:42] together
[1:40:47] Hallelujah glory be to
[1:40:50] God you love the Lord
[1:41:00] now so when
[1:41:03] elaser went to take
[1:41:06] Rebecca praise the
[1:41:14] Lord there is another part of this whole
[1:41:17] Redemption
[1:41:19] story that
[1:41:21] is that God place in a way that you have
[1:41:25] to pay attention and let's pick a few of
[1:41:28] that as we look at
[1:41:36] this
[1:41:46] amen when you read Genesis 24
[1:41:55] the Bible talks about this man this
[1:41:58] seven of Abraham that went to take his
[1:42:05] bride because he was the one that was
[1:42:09] commissioned the emphasis is on the
[1:42:13] seven but the Bible also make us to
[1:42:17] know
[1:42:19] that Rebecca had to water him
[1:42:24] cell and it was not one it was more than
[1:42:29] one praise the
[1:42:35] Lord if you watch carefully here with
[1:42:44] me I pointed this out to you sometime
[1:42:47] ago and uh but since we
[1:42:51] uh we uh on the subject let's look at it
[1:42:59] again praise the
[1:43:20] Lord I pointed this out to you some some
[1:43:23] time
[1:43:25] ago all of those camel that Ela went
[1:43:29] with Ela never went
[1:43:33] alone there were men that went with El
[1:43:36] eer because the the Jewish
[1:43:40] marriage should be witnessed by 10
[1:43:45] men it should be witnessed by 10 men
[1:43:50] they have a they have a Jewish word for
[1:43:52] that I can I can get it up on top of my
[1:43:54] head now but uh
[1:44:01] uh but if you look right here in the
[1:44:03] scripture I just I just wanted to bring
[1:44:06] uh
[1:44:32] just give me a few minutes here I kind
[1:44:35] of cut myself off God to bring this to
[1:44:39] you because what I was talking about uh
[1:44:43] the Redeemer
[1:44:45] redeeming uh this whole story of a thing
[1:44:48] pop up in my mind
[1:45:04] the scripture speaks about Abraham and
[1:45:06] his
[1:45:17] men because it has it has a perect type
[1:45:21] there is something I want to I want to
[1:45:23] make emphasis on if I can just get the
[1:45:24] verse and read it to you then I will I
[1:45:28] will uh I will take it up from there you
[1:45:31] know brother br will talk about Faithful
[1:45:33] Men that that that St with uh with the
[1:45:37] messenger he talks about Joshua he talks
[1:45:41] about he talks about uh uh uh Elijah
[1:45:48] standing with Elijah and uh uh
[1:46:02] okay let's just let's just go ahead I
[1:46:04] will if I grab it I'll get it I will get
[1:46:06] it to you let me not take all of my S of
[1:46:08] time on this now so the picture that I
[1:46:12] wanted to bring to you is that the
[1:46:13] Redeemer is always in his
[1:46:17] Redemption he's always in his
[1:46:20] Redemption you cannot take the Redeemer
[1:46:22] out of his Redemption it will not be a
[1:46:25] complete Redemption amen it won't be a
[1:46:28] complete
[1:46:29] Redemption uh if you take the Redeemer
[1:46:32] out of it out of his Redemption it will
[1:46:34] not be a complete
[1:46:36] Redemption uh the Redeemer has to be in
[1:46:40] his
[1:46:42] redemption or else the Redemption will
[1:46:44] not be complete so we see that over and
[1:46:48] over uh uh is play out throughout the
[1:46:51] scripture you go over to the Book of
[1:46:53] Ruth you will see the very same thing
[1:46:57] there and
[1:47:02] uh because you see God don't break he
[1:47:05] don't break the order of his word no he
[1:47:08] don't break the order of his
[1:47:10] word he always bring the word to pass
[1:47:15] the way it's supposed to be
[1:47:26] praise the
[1:47:40] Lord now so we see
[1:47:44] here thank you brother
[1:47:46] Dan now so we see that uh
[1:47:51] uh uh
[1:47:59] let me read something something here so
[1:48:01] I can I can be able to capture my
[1:48:03] thought again brother B says over in God
[1:48:06] has a provided way let's let's just read
[1:48:08] this
[1:48:13] together now the Lord of redemption in
[1:48:17] the Old
[1:48:18] Testament that it must be a Kingsman
[1:48:21] Redeemer the Lord
[1:48:24] required not any person could redeem a
[1:48:28] lost
[1:48:29] estate but it had to be
[1:48:33] somebody that was King fo praise the
[1:48:36] Lord it had to be somebody that was King
[1:48:40] folks somebody that was King
[1:48:46] folks and then somebody that was able to
[1:48:50] redeem
[1:48:52] worthy enough to redeem
[1:48:56] financially able he has to be
[1:48:59] financially
[1:49:01] able how beautiful oh my Christ worthy
[1:49:05] double worthy the king of Heaven seeing
[1:49:09] the little holy spirit filled Church
[1:49:12] dropping a little handful now and then
[1:49:16] notice the only way that God could
[1:49:19] redeem God had to come down and be be
[1:49:23] made King folks to
[1:49:25] us praise the
[1:49:27] Lord God has to come down and be made
[1:49:31] King folks to up
[1:49:34] us you cannot help any
[1:49:38] mortar if you are not willing to step in
[1:49:41] their
[1:49:46] shoes you can help
[1:49:49] them brother BR talks about there in
[1:49:52] Mexico he said I saw that blind man just
[1:49:54] like my father I I try to measure his
[1:49:57] shoulder to see if my coat will fit him
[1:50:00] I took up my shoes to see if if it will
[1:50:03] fit him he says all I was trying to do I
[1:50:05] was trying to put myself in his
[1:50:08] place it says and there God gave a
[1:50:11] vision and he got his
[1:50:18] sight just like I said our faithfulness
[1:50:21] is partial is limited is
[1:50:26] conditioned would rather help people
[1:50:28] from a
[1:50:31] distance but sometime the real work of
[1:50:33] redemption you have to step into that
[1:50:36] person's
[1:50:38] shoes to be able to understand what they
[1:50:41] are going through what they are dealing
[1:50:46] with sometimes we think we understand
[1:50:49] you are looking at it from your side
[1:50:53] you are looking at it from your side you
[1:50:55] are reasoning how you will deal with it
[1:50:58] but you are not
[1:51:05] them are we
[1:51:08] together you are not
[1:51:17] them what an awesome God we serve
[1:51:24] the king of glory god had to come down
[1:51:26] and be made King first to us God was in
[1:51:30] spirit
[1:51:32] God come down and was made flesh God was
[1:51:36] in Christ reconciling the word to
[1:51:41] himself then in order to redeem men he
[1:51:45] had to become
[1:51:48] man he has to step in our shoes
[1:51:54] he had to step in this shoes of us
[1:51:57] existing element to be touched by the
[1:52:00] feelings of our
[1:52:02] infirmities to know what it is to be
[1:52:06] rejected he Ste in our shoes right from
[1:52:10] birth he knew what it is to be in the
[1:52:13] womb for nine
[1:52:16] months even down to the Grave he know
[1:52:19] what it is to be in a dark grave
[1:52:29] he was touched by the feelings of our
[1:52:33] infi are we
[1:52:38] together you love the
[1:52:48] Lord Brother Brandon will says in the
[1:52:50] message St you of a perfect man when he
[1:52:53] talks
[1:52:54] about uh uh uh the position of our
[1:52:59] age in in in the
[1:53:01] stature in the stature of the seven
[1:53:04] Church ages when he talks about our age
[1:53:07] being the age of Brotherly kindness he
[1:53:10] says this is what brotherly kindness
[1:53:15] is he says when we get to that brotherly
[1:53:19] kindness put yourself in the
[1:53:23] place on the
[1:53:28] matter praise the
[1:53:30] Lord when job was going through his
[1:53:36] trial the devil told the Lord and says
[1:53:39] uh you you know you you have put a you
[1:53:41] put an edge around him you know and uh
[1:53:44] and the devil told him all of
[1:53:46] this after sickness uh I mean job all
[1:53:50] job children die in
[1:53:54] everything the Lord came back again and
[1:53:56] say have you considered my seven job I
[1:53:58] love that place in the
[1:54:01] Bible I wrote it down many years ago
[1:54:04] still looking for an inspiration to
[1:54:05] preach it you know why the devil told
[1:54:08] job he say skin on
[1:54:12] skin praise the Lord you can break you
[1:54:16] can talk about it until it touch
[1:54:21] you Jo he said job can live for his hand
[1:54:24] and say blessed be the the lord gave it

[1:54:35] touch
[1:54:39] him let it touch
[1:54:45] him they say when the robber meets the
[1:54:49] road praise the Lord when the robber
[1:54:52] miss the road that's where you know the
[1:54:55] reality of
[1:54:59] things we can sit back we can judge
[1:55:01] people we can tell people story more
[1:55:06] thans praise the
[1:55:08] lord we can tell their story molding
[1:55:13] thems I mean even even even some of our
[1:55:16] young people it's just so easy to sit
[1:55:18] back there and you know well you see
[1:55:20] them in church one time you don't see
[1:55:21] them you you you have a thought you have
[1:55:23] an idea about them and and uh I mean
[1:55:26] what what's what's what form of
[1:55:27] redemption is that that's the devil's
[1:55:30] Redemption because the devil's form
[1:55:32] which of course he don't redeem any way
[1:55:34] he's just an
[1:55:37] accuser he's an accuser of the bread
[1:55:39] he's always looking for some kind of a
[1:55:41] fault always looking for something to
[1:55:43] say about you
[1:55:52] praise the
[1:55:54] Lord when we get to that brother the
[1:55:57] kindness put yourself in a place on the
[1:56:00] matter now you said my brother sin
[1:56:03] against me said Peter shall I forgive
[1:56:06] him he said he said uh seven times today

[1:56:15] brother if a brother all out of tone
[1:56:18] don't be impatient with
[1:56:20] him praise the
[1:56:24] Lord putting yourself in the place on
[1:56:27] the
[1:56:32] matter praise the
[1:56:45] Lord that's the reason why the Bible
[1:56:47] says there is only one
[1:56:49] mediator between man the man Christ
[1:56:55] Jesus he had to step down in our
[1:57:00] shoes we had to take our
[1:57:07] place and what I'm trying to show you is
[1:57:12] that Our Redeemer is faithful in
[1:57:17] truth praise the
[1:57:19] Lord every promise he have made he will
[1:57:22] k keep his
[1:57:24] promises he said he will have a church
[1:57:27] without spot or Rinker he will keep his
[1:57:32] promises praise the
[1:57:35] Lord all we have to do is just is just
[1:57:39] acknowledge his
[1:57:42] presence when we acknowledge his
[1:57:45] presence that he's in our midst to do
[1:57:48] what he said he will do brother Bram say
[1:57:51] he's he does not come as an unlocker
[1:57:54] he's not a recording Angel he does not
[1:57:58] come around and say this one is sleeping
[1:57:59] in church oh I'm I'm going to take note
[1:58:02] on them and this other person is is just
[1:58:04] distracted they're thinking about
[1:58:05] shopping I'm going he does not come he
[1:58:08] comes to bring to manifest his word he
[1:58:11] comes to make his word real he's a God
[1:58:14] that want to step out of the pages of
[1:58:17] the Bible and become real to his
[1:58:21] people
[1:58:24] amen praise the
[1:58:27] Lord as long as we keep God behind the
[1:58:31] clouds that's what tradition we do it
[1:58:33] keeps God behind the cloud on the great
[1:58:37] throne but the prophet of God says some
[1:58:39] days you'll realize that heaven is not
[1:58:41] behind the cloud here it's just a
[1:58:44] dimension that is right here this
[1:58:47] morning amen it's just a dimension that
[1:58:50] is very so close to us
[1:58:57] you love the
[1:59:00] Lord what a wonderful
[1:59:07] Jesus the Lord is
[1:59:09] good amen he has not forsaken his
[1:59:14] people he have not left us in the
[1:59:17] hands of of of men to to misuse us and
[1:59:21] and and and and misjudge
[1:59:24] us no he
[1:59:26] promised that he will be with us
[1:59:30] amen that he will go with us he will
[1:59:33] never leave us he will never forsake
[1:59:37] us okay
[1:59:39] beautiful I knew it was right here we
[1:59:41] will get it Genesis chapter
[1:59:48] 24 Genesis chapter 24 if you if you if
[1:59:52] you read 24 carefully you'll realize
[1:59:55] that two times the Bible mentioned these
[1:59:57] men verse 53 and and the Seven BR for
[2:00:02] Jew and of silver and Jew of gold and
[2:00:06] Ren and gave them to
[2:00:09] Rebecca and gave also to her
[2:00:13] brother and to her mother precious
[2:00:17] things and they did eat and drink he and
[2:00:23] the
[2:00:25] men he and the men so El is are never
[2:00:30] went
[2:00:31] alone all those cell that Rebecca felt
[2:00:35] there were men that were carrying
[2:00:38] them and this last day Ela never never
[2:00:42] came alone God has raised up
[2:00:47] men praise the
[2:00:50] Lord God has has raised up men to
[2:00:53] witness the ministry of ela and to carry
[2:00:58] out the work of getting out the
[2:01:01] bride but you see because Ela was the
[2:01:04] one that was giv the commission that is
[2:01:07] the reason why the scripture emphasized
[2:01:10] on
[2:01:14] him but there were men that went with
[2:01:16] Ela to carry out the
[2:01:19] commission and that is the reason why
[2:01:21] God have to raise up a fful ministrate
[2:01:24] in this day to be able to carry out the
[2:01:27] commission that was given to our La
[2:01:33] ether praise the
[2:01:37] Lord I knew he was there I read
[2:01:41] it and the did eat and drink he and the
[2:01:44] men that were with him and the T all
[2:01:46] night and the rose up early in the
[2:01:48] morning and he said send me the way onto
[2:01:51] my master so you see if you if you play
[2:01:55] it in the prophecy El is that is taking
[2:01:58] the place of the Holy
[2:02:00] Ghost praise the Lord he's taking the
[2:02:03] place of the Holy Ghost that's the
[2:02:04] reason why his name is not mentioned in
[2:02:06] the text but we know that he is the
[2:02:09] seven because he's the one that go
[2:02:12] Abraham pointed out to
[2:02:14] God and said this is a faithful one in
[2:02:16] my
[2:02:19] house because there was a prophecy that
[2:02:22] was playing out a Divine prophecy of
[2:02:25] from Calvary to the Redemption of the
[2:02:31] Bride are we
[2:02:34] together now so you see that's a
[2:02:37] Redemption
[2:02:39] language the Redeemer have to step on
[2:02:42] the
[2:02:44] scene praise the Lord the Redeemer have
[2:02:48] to step on the
[2:02:49] scene we can counsel so you we can
[2:02:52] encourage you until God become real to
[2:02:56] you until he become real and he become
[2:03:00] personal to
[2:03:01] you all you have is just an
[2:03:04] understanding all you have is just an
[2:03:06] intellectual is just op
[2:03:09] here but for this world to live God has
[2:03:13] to be
[2:03:15] flesh for the word to come to pass in
[2:03:18] your life God have to be flesh
[2:03:22] the same way he tell Moses take of your
[2:03:24] shoes that's the same way he's telling
[2:03:26] us get rid of your proud get rid of your
[2:03:29] arrogance said get rid of your tradition
[2:03:31] and your Creed I want to step down into
[2:03:34] that
[2:03:38] body even if it is just one soul that I
[2:03:41] will win I want to use your body for
[2:03:44] that if you will just take off your
[2:03:50] shoes praise the Lord when he stepped
[2:03:53] down Moses says I can't talk he said who
[2:03:55] make
[2:03:56] mouth I make mouth or I want just give
[2:04:00] me your
[2:04:01] shoes let me step in it the work will be
[2:04:04] done I'm not I'm not relying on your
[2:04:07] ability all I want you is just
[2:04:10] surrounder I'm not looking at your
[2:04:12] strength I'm not looking at your
[2:04:13] intelligence just give me a vessel to
[2:04:16] use oh if the church would just give God
[2:04:19] a vessel to use if we were just give him
[2:04:22] our boat we will get a great catch amen
[2:04:27] if we would give God our boat we will
[2:04:29] get a great
[2:04:37] catch we put God so much in the distance
[2:04:41] that's why sometimes we do things to
[2:04:42] ourself and do things to others with no
[2:04:46] consciousness that is right before God
[2:04:54] praise the
[2:04:57] lord we have the H man picture on our
[2:05:00] wall the pillow of fire picture
[2:05:02] everywhere but yet we fuss and we do
[2:05:08] things that just shows the the the least
[2:05:11] of
[2:05:13] Consciousness he said you are not the
[2:05:15] one that told him to he said it I will
[2:05:18] not leave you I will not forsake you
[2:05:27] praise the Lord the church has put him
[2:05:29] behind the clouds the church has put him
[2:05:32] in the
[2:05:33] distance we got to fast and pray we need
[2:05:36] we need seven days of fast so God can
[2:05:38] come close we need to you we need to cry
[2:05:40] to God oh we need to that's what the
[2:05:42] church is doing we want to bring God oh
[2:05:44] God is so far we want to bring that's
[2:05:46] just how those prophets of
[2:05:48] B Elijah told them maybe God is on
[2:05:51] vacation
[2:05:53] if your God is so far like that that you
[2:05:55] have to cut
[2:05:57] yourself that's what the church has
[2:05:59] given to us put God in so much of a
[2:06:02] distance that we can stay right in the
[2:06:05] church we can fast we can we can uh
[2:06:07] argue with one another right in the
[2:06:09] church when we are praising God why

[2:30:35] alter all you can do just
[2:30:39] cry because that is the way that is
[2:30:42] designed by God for a
[2:30:45] baby to express themsel is to cry out
[2:30:57] [Music]
[2:31:02] Lord saints of
[2:31:04] God what has been given to us is the
[2:31:07] opening of the
[2:31:10] word the prophet is not coming back to
[2:31:12] open the word we don't believe in a
[2:31:14] return Ministry the word is already open
[2:31:17] the Holy Ghost is here to make this word
[2:31:19] real to to you that's the work of the
[2:31:21] Holy Ghost to make this word real to
[2:31:24] make Jesus Christ a person to you get
[2:31:27] you out of
[2:31:30] religion and get us to the reality of
[2:31:32] Jesus
[2:31:35] Christ you mean that God will be so
[2:31:37] wicked and allow you to to starve
[2:31:39] yourself for seven days starve yourself
[2:31:41] for 21
[2:31:43] days just because you want something
[2:31:45] from him that's how religion has abused
[2:31:48] our mind
[2:31:51] that we have to do that to please
[2:31:54] God I believe in fasting and praying I
[2:31:57] do that all the

[2:33:53] to be on the side where we just judge
[2:33:55] people by just looking at
