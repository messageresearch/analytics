take our Bibles and go to Genesis chapter 1 Wednesday night we we spoke on uh uh now the birth of Jesus was on this wise we want to continue in the that line of thought this coming week uh brother Frank prer down in ainer is having his annual meetings you have asked for us to come and be with them so uh on Friday uh we will be heading out for for that weekend Services there so and then uh uh uh brother Elijah uh jebo from Liberia here uh a pastor of Happy Valley Church there in Liberia and then brother uh Solomon CI from uh uh seon will be flying in on Thursday I will go down with brother Solomon Elijah will stay and preach for us on Sunday morning so uh uh he's a he's a familiar person with us and uh uh but both of them will be coming in on Thursday praise the Lord Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 we will read uh uh Genesis 11 let's read 11 Genesis 1 verse 11 and God said let the Earth bring for GR the herb yielding seeds and the fruit trees yielding fruit after his kind who seiz is in itself upon the Earth and it was so praise the Lord and the Earth brought full grass and the herb yelling seeds after his kind and the trees yelling fruits are yelling fruits who seeds was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good let's drop down to verse 26 let's drop down to verse 26 Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fows of the earth and over the cattles and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man praise the Lord now I want for us to pay attention to that while you have your seat uh uh the Lord bless you you can have have your seed in verse 26 the Bible says God said let us make man in our image and in our likeness and then in verse 27 the Bible says so God make Man In His Image praise the Lord in in in chapter 20 26 it looks like it was more than one person in chap in in verse 27 it appears that it is one person praise the Lord amen and God said let us make men in our image and in our likeness and let them have dominion over the fishes of uh the seed and over the fowls of the earth and over uh the Earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in His image and in the image of God created he him male and female created he them praise the Lord now when you when you read Genesis chapter one where this whole thing of uh that looks like uh uh uh uh a confusion or the misinterpretation and also uh uh a doctrine of uh multiple gods have come out of the here is because in the in the Hebrew the word god year is Elohim and Elohim have a pural sense so the the the the the translator Year trying to use that word Elohim and he's he's he's he's expressing it in the sense of let us because if Elohim is having in a pural sense praise the Lord amen let let me give you an example uh a cherub one of the Angels okay that is around the throne a cherub you will you will see that in in the in the Hebrew one is a cherub two is cherubin that without an s you see in some translation they have an S it should not have an S one is a cherub more than one cherubin not s now that is the same sense with the word Elohim the word Elohim you see you you you remember when brother BR would talk about El Elohim so Elohim has a sense a a it's it's a plural word and I think that's word this uh uh uh uh uh translation from the Hebrew the Greek and the English that brings us this sense of let us make men but then in verse 27 the Bible says God make men not they make men praise the Lord amen if it was more than one then it should be they make man in their image but it is one God praise the Lord so God made Man In His Image male and female created he them praise the Lord amen so the Lord bless you this morning and uh uh uh it's going to be in the house of the Lord and and uh uh we want to thank God for giving us this opportunity like I said we we started talking to something on Wednesday night and uh uh Matthew chapter 1 let's go to Matthew chapter 1 praise the Lord you have to remember now we we uh dwelling a little bit on on the subject of the Virgin birth praise the Lord we've been dwelling on the subject of the Virgin birth because we say the Virgin birth is is one of the most important subject in the Bible praise the Lord the Virgin birth is tied to the promise of uh Genesis 3:15 the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the sepin praise the Lord amen and is because God put the mystery the Redemption in the woman and uh and he gives the woman three sacri virtue to protect that mystery of redemption praise the Lord amen through sacri virtue her the Virgin say her motherhood her Womanhood and her motherhood and uh uh uh you can pick up all of that from uh um uh invisible union now so uh uh we went over this uh the couple of two services that if you ever get the Virgin birth straighten out you get Christianity straighten out amen that's what we have been talking about if you get the Virgin birth straightened out you get Christianity straighten out the early church after the Reformation uh uh uh when when uh when Luther came out of the Catholic Church the the subject on the Virgin birth was a big uh uh argument there was a big uh uh uh uh you know argument dispute and uh uh zling and a lot of the other guys that came out from the Revival of of Luther their understanding of the Virgin birth was there uh uh Jesus the son of Joseph called the Son of God that was their understanding of uh of the Virgin birth Jesus the son of Joseph called the Son of God because if you look into Matthew account and Luke account you will realize that Matthew talking about the kingship of Jesus we we we deal with this before but uh just to to to give a context to what we are saying Matthew chapter 1 let's go back to Matthew chapter 1 verse one praise the Lord Matthew chapter 1 verse one the book of uh the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham which of course that's our attraction there Abraham was before David why the Matthew say the son of David the son of Abraham in actual context it must be the son of Abraham the son of David praise the Lord but Matthew said this because he was going to make emphasis on the kingship he was going to make emphasis on the promise that was given to David that his seed will be on the throne so Matthew was Matthew the entire Matthew account there is no there is no account that record the wise men coming and say where is he born King of the Jews beside Matthew Matthew is the only one that recorded there because Matthew under the anointing of the Holy Spirit he was going to talk about the kingship from David to Jesus because Jesus was the son of David that was going to sit on the throne of David forever not now but in the millennium are we together amen praise the Lord so Matthew here under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost he comes out and he says the son of Jesus I mean the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David and the son of Abraham now so if you go through the entire uh uh uh uh uh genealogy there in Matthew chapter one you will realize that Matthew established the fact that from David amen that was given the promise of the kingship the lineage run down and Joseph that will marry married she was a son of David I mean he was a son of David he he's in the lineage with David praise the Lord now you can now see why zling and the rest of them will said Jesus the son of Joseph called the Son of God why because Joseph lineage go back to David but if you go in the Book of Luke you will also realize that the genealogy that is given in the Book of Ruth relates to Mary not Joseph praise the Lord no is not Joseph but it still goes back to David but it don't go back to David through Solomon Joseph lineage go back to David through Solomon Mary lineage go back to David through naon because Solomon had another Son by BBA called naon are we together oh I finish giving you a Bible studies you can just go study that the rest of the week the rest of the year amen so uh uh uh so you see everything goes back to David because that's the scepter of Abra that's the scepter of isra that's the kingship so the two geny you will realize h mark never gave a genology no because Mark all his thing was about seven he was about seven so he never gave no genology John gave his own genology but John own was back to what happened on the island of pmos he went in the beginning was the word the word was with God and you know he went way back before even David are we together now so I I'm I'm saying all of this for us to be able to see the importance of the Virgin birath praise the Lord the importance of the Virgin birth if we can get the Virgin birth straight we'll get all of this confusion out of Christianity the Virgin birth holds the Mystery of Life praise the Lord I'll give you just a scene here we read Genesis chapter one the Earth was a virgin and God was going to bring life on the earth God did not had to contact Council of men or Council of angels and that's the reason why we read that verse he says let us make man praise the Lord and God made Man In His Image it was God that did it praise the Lord that's the same thing with the Virgin birth it was God that did it he just borrowed the womb he provided the blood cell he provided the egg cell praise the Lord the same way he brought man in the beginning the first man the first item praise the Lord the first Adam came with no human contribution the second Adam came the same way with no human involvement praise the Lord Mary was just like the Earth just like the Earth receed the first Adam when God made man that was the same word Mary received the second Adam praise the Lord and if God will ever bring forth children he will bring forth his children the very same way nothing of your natural birth is attached to God's birth the church have all sorts of explanation for the new birth you have to do this you have to do that to be born again you have to confess to be born again you have to that that just what man has established to have some other in their denomination but what God will do God Alone will do it praise the Lord amen we love the Lord this morning ready for the word of God Amen praise the Lord don't worry as we go down this uh this series we we'll get into the the genealogy I will show you where where the difference comes in Matthew and Luke uh as we go along not today but I will show you there uh uh praise the Lord amen but if you go home just just read both of them you will see that it's it's it's a little bit different and uh Matthew starts with David and Solomon and he goes down Luke introduced nurn and he goes down because that's where Mary Lage came from praise the Lord amen You Know The Enemy was trying to he was trying to attack us on this subject you know and uh but I still feel in my heart that's what the Lord want me to speak on praise the Lord so uh Hallelujah now so as we look into this subject I'm trying to get something that is also important we have spoken on it before and uh but as we as we look into this we just want to kind of a recap here with uh some of the things that we have look at praise the Lord now so Matthew chapter 1 verse uh 18 that's where we were reading from and we read uh now the birth of Jesus was on this wise when as his mother Mary was exposed to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen and I believe that is uh the the the misunderstanding of the Virgin birth that also uh uh brings the the teach teaching of the Trinity the Trinity is not a Biblical teaching it cannot be proven by the scripture but it's is because of the misunderstanding of the of the Virgin birth because if you even look right here you will see that the Bible says she's formed with child of the Holy Ghost and uh uh uh and then you go down and read uh uh the scripture will let us know that uh uh ACC calling to the promise in verse 22 now all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall uh shall be with chai and shall bring forth a son and they shall called his name Emmanuel which is being in in which being interpreted is God with us praise the Lord amen so it is it is just like uh uh in the beginning when God made Man In His Image the first Adam he was the amateure God on the earth you know it was God making a Man In His Image the Bible say God is a spirit you know uh so Genesis 1:26 that man that was made was a spirit man Genesis chapter 2:7 God put that spirit in flesh flesh praise the Lord just like God coming in flesh in Jesus are we together amen praise the Lord amen God made Man In His Image as a spirit man in Genesis CH 2:7 the Bible says and God formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth and breath into man and Man became a living Soul so the spirit man that was made here was now put in a they are we together praise the Lord amen God speaking to Mary here the angel saying the the holy the holy spirit will overshadow you and that and that thing that that child that will be born it will be of the Holy Ghost and at the end the Bible says it will be what God With Us Praise the Lord amen so it is just God manifesting in uh uh uh in three different office the god uh that that that led the children of Israel in in uh in in the father hold by the pillow of fire he's now coming and dwelling in the body flesh of which he produced the blood cells he produced the AEG cells you know it it it it it will not be connected to the fall to the sin of man because he has to be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the word praise the Lord and God will come and step in that body amen amen to be able to pay the ramom for fly man to redeem us back to God praise the Lord amen so I uh uh I know I'm going in Cycles this morning because I'm I'm trying to to uh to find a place to stand this morning I want us to look at something a little bit uh different in the same light but a little bit different so we can get into this subject let's read this together we will read something out of the s that church Edge and uh uh and then we will that I will I will study from there this morning I hope you you have breakfast this morning amen amen if you did that you just like me and I didn't have breakfast so I won't keep you long amen let's look at that this morning from the seminar Church age I know there's a question in your mind when we talk about this whole virgin birth birath of a thing uh I want for us to look at this you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of preexistence Praise the Lord now look at this word pre-existence the reason why we must look at it and pay attention to it is because in many sense the way we understand predestination is wrong we understand predestination in the sense of preexistence is a lot of this things Doctrine is not biblical praise the Lord the reason why is not biblical because I have a birth date amen amen I have a birthdaye that October 1 that was the day I began that was the day this body was born before that time this body did not exist are we together you got to put on your seat belt now because we we we're going to talk about serious stuff here you want to know if I believe in the doctrine of preexistence I don't believe in the M's Doctrine or the preexistence of Soul anymore then I Believe In recognation Praise the Lord all that comes from uh uh uh you know the the Hindus and all of their believing there all the transmigration of souls now if we don't study the word properly there are a lot of things in the way we see it and in the way we understand it we comes to apply this just like the same I said you know uh uh uh uh uh many many churches will will want to uh uh uh put the whole uh uh holy Virgin Mary thing on the Catholic church but many of the the the the the churches and and in the way that we think about it uh uh we come shut off the same the same teaching if we are given the the opportunity to express what we understand we will up the same place where the Catholic end up and that's what I believe that many message believer will end up explaining uh predestination to the pre-existence which of course that's not that's not biblical Let's Stay Together this morning be careful here and see this that's what I want you to see that's what I want us to see this morning be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated internally from God it is not the person that comes predestinated praise the Lord why because you have a birth date are we together amen are you having church this morning it's not the person that comes predestinated internally from God it is the word it is the word it is the seed and a word is a thought Express it is not you as a person not me as a person that comes predestinated no it's the thought of God Amen because God's thought are interal praise the Lord are we together his thoughts are in tenner so in his internal thoughts before there were time he destinated in ages what he would do are we together amen and and that predestinated thought of God will find a bing are we together praise the Lord amen his predestinated thought will find a b when the prophet said a virgin shall conceive the prophet never said the Virgin Mary the prophet said a virgin and Mary was not the only virgin are we together but that predestinated word form AB body that the word will be fulfilled in are we together praise the Lord so it's not the person that's the reason why people can shout and predestinated kick their shoes up oh I'm predestinated and this that and and then after a while you find them drinking running around with people wives backsliding because it is not the person it's the word is the word is the seed it is not you as a person praise the Lord that's the reason why when Grace find you it humble you you don't become proud and condemn other people that have not found Grace because you know that there is a seed word that has dropped in your heart you must humble yourself to that word are we together it is not the person that comes predestinated internally from God it is the word or the seed that is it way back too far back for the human mind to Gras the interal God H uh with interal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob I love but Esau I hate Romans 9:13 neither and neither was born uh and and neither of the sons were born and neither had done good or evil see it was the thought praise the Lord amen it was not after Esau at before God hated him amen right it was not after Jacob good behavior before God loved him it was the thought that's right praise the Lord amen you love the Lord amen praise the Lord I know I was not going to S milk this morning amen praise the Lord Paul said we have grown up we must start sucking milk we must get down to eat real food amen let's get down to eat real food glory be to God love the Lord amen see it was the thought and then that thought be became expressed and God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone was the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and the coveting praise the Lord if you are a true seed you will hear the word the spirit will baptize you oh I forget we have a baptis in after service this morning uh uh one of uh uh uh brother blessing son will be baptized this morning amen the spirit will baptize you in the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age amen glory be to God so uh uh we were looking at the birth of Jesus on this wise and John is I mean uh um Matthew is trying to give us a scene that it happened like this this birth of Jesus happened like this and and and and an angel met uh uh uh this young woman and and and uh uh before Mary Mary was Asos to Joseph just like I said on Wednesday night she was going about her normal life life praise the Lord as a young woman she was preparing for her wedding never had in her mind never had in her mind if Mary was h h h uh having in her mind and preparing to be the one to give birth to Jesus she would not go around uh uh trying to find H H uh or giving herself over to Joseph to be uh h a wife it was not part of her plan Redemption is not part of our plan praise the Lord No Redemption was not part of your plan there is nothing on your calandar said you will you will be redeemed is this day you'll be born again this is when you will receive the Holy Ghost you don't have that on your calandar praise the Lord but it's on God's cander because he thought about it from the foundation of the word he put a date to it and that date came pass when he ready for you he will get you he put a date to it on his calendar praise the Lord hallelujah oh the the the church is trying to produce uh h h h uh example of Mary and says well you know you you can be a non you know poor white hair Mary were not wearing hair tie Mary was dressing like any normal Juda girl praise the Lord living her normal life she was not in a Convent praise the Lord amen the only Convent that Mary had was this word of God Amen in the Torah that told her that she she she she had to keep herself until she's married that the only Convent that Mary had there was not s Teresa there was not s Mary there was not s Susanna praise the Lord but she was going about her normal life but a prophet 700 years have prophesied that a virgin shall conceive praise the Lord there was a word from the prophet Isaiah that said Israel I will give you a sign praise the Lord I will give you a sign a virgin shall conceive are we together praise the Lord hallelujah the preacher has preached the pastor has talked about it and over and over I mean they went to church they had read it in the Bible and all of that are we together but God was determined because according to his counsel his word do not fail God word do not fail it do not fall to the ground praise the Lord who would be that virgin is God God's choice praise the Lord amen it's God's choice if you even look in our natural birth by signs the couple can say we want a boy child you know we want a girl child and this this but it's God that determine that choice because he choose a set blood cell from the male and a set in the midst of the million cells for you to be here there were hundreds of other cell if God will have chosing something different it will not be you praise the Lord amen when that blood cells were released there were thousands and millions of gem but God was the one that choose this one and he choose this Exel praise the Lord praise the Lord and He brought it together for you to have a birthday praise the Lord if God was not determined if it was never in his thought if it did not pass through his mind that you came on Earth amen you will never be yet you will not remember you will not know nothing about it you w know nothing about it are we together what are we trying to to emphasize this morning is the councel of God standing Shore amen the counsel of God standed sure and what God is determined there is no political power amen there is no situation around the world that is going to stop it glory be to God because prophecy is stronger than politics when God has spoken it's going to be just as he said amen hallelujah and we continue to read then Joseph her husband being a just man and now willing to make a public example was mindful to put her away privately because he couldn't he couldn't understand this thing he couldn't understand this thing how how can this young woman have not slept with her how can she be how can she come to me and tell me that she's pregnant praise the Lord he couldn't understand it he said okay I'm not going to I'm not going to mess with this okay I'm not going to f with her either because she's telling me an angel spoke to her praise the Lord so I'll put it away privately and why he taught on these things because God was determined why he was thinking on it praise the Lord because God was determined and God also had him in a program why because he's from the lineage of David praise the Lord and this child is tied to the promise of David's strong Hallelujah so the Bible says God visited him in the night and why he taught on these things behold the angel the angel the same angel that spoke to Mary of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thy son of David fear not to take unto thee married thy wife amen that's your wife but I'm on a mission God is saying that's your wife boy but I'm on a mission don't be afraid to take her Hallelujah for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring for the son and thou shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sin praise the Lord hallelujah you see and that's that's that's that's the thing where uh a false teaching would do what a false teaching does is that a false teaching can be smart it can be very clever but it it it Rob the thought of the power because if you establish Trinity and put a God in heaven and leave a son on the earth and put a spirit to Holy Ghost to just be running around what you do is that you leave a vulnerable man on the earth while the power is still in heaven praise the Lord but Jesus said all power in heaven and on Earth I gave to me praise the Lord are we together so this was God the very same Creator and that's the reason why it's now hard to understand when God created man in His image that's what the Bible says so when he when he had Adam there and and and structure a body all the spirit did was just to step in that body if we can understand that then to understand the birth of Jesus it has to be the same it has to be the same Creator God it has to be the same Elohim that stepped down into that body praise the Lord are we together now all these things were done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by a prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel World which being interpreted is God With Us Praise the Lord so all of this is fulfilled because a prophet said it praise the Lord amen hallelujah and everything today is happening because a prophet said it hallelujah amen there's going to be a bride because a prophet said it there's going to be a Rapture because a prophet said it praise the Lord and if a prophet said it God will God will find a people amen God will gather a body there are people that God will preserve that will not taste death why because a prophet said it there's a people in the twinkling of an eye that will be changed they will step out of this body and step into a brand new body why because a Prophet said it all of this is fulfilled because a prophet said it hallelujah oh my the word of the Lord is beautiful amen the word of the Lord is beautiful glory be to God Hal hallelujah amen you know one time someone was talking to brother brandom about this same old virgin birth thing and the guy was saying you I mean you're too smart to believe that you know you're too smart to believe there how how can you believe in in in in every form of nature if there will be birth even in the plant life if there will be birth there has to be uh uh the coming together of the male and the female so how can you believe that you know brother B went down and told the God and says you know uh the thing about it that is that uh uh how did the first man came here if everything has to have a father and a mother amen when the first man came there was not father and mother but he was here praise the Lord amen and he also starts to to show and prove that uh uh uh uh you know the real thing of life you can't prove it amen you know he went down uh uh uh and and and he was asking the guide and says uh uh uh uh do you love your wife he said yes brother Braham says prove it to me he says show it show it to me you know reach in your life show it visibly let me see it praise the Lord amen reach inside and let me see it we believe we have we have soul that's what's make us superior to the animals but there's no doctor that can operate you and find your soul no doctor can operate you and find your soul praise the Lord but your soul is real amen your soul is real it's there glory be to God hallelujah so you see that's the reason why you know there's a there's a there's a whole lot of thing uh uh uh uh you know uh the the the the real things of this life are Supernatural praise the Lord that's what the scripture says the scripture says the thing that we see they are perishable the ones that we can see they are perishable this body will come to a to a time where it gives its last birth it will be lied down in a cold uh uh Earth covered with dirt it had the day that it was born it will had the time that it would die but your soul lays on praise the Lord but you see because because we are we are we are very narrow-minded in our human sense we put lot of emphasis and importance on the perishable things because that's what we can see praise the Lord you see and that's that's the reason for the for the fifth sense because the sense of faith comes to be able to help you to look at the things that you can see with your natural eyes it give you a sense that you have a soul that when this body lays to the ground there is a part of you that will stand before God praise the Lord oh what a wonderful Jesus we Ser Hallelujah so you understand the thought that we try to establish there that is the seed that comes predestinated it's not the person it's not the individual is the seed is the promised word praise the Lord the reason why you can you can you can believe that I'm a predestinated seed is because you have received the word that you are identifying with you are identifying with the word amen you are identifying with what God is doing in this day and what God is doing in your life but it's not the person that comes predestinated it's the word amen let me give you an example here if you drop down yet a little bit let's read something out of Christ is the mystery of God God revealed that's something we have read before follow me here all those all those things type him just a type but yet the mystery was HD then men didn't know what they were doing the Old Testament types David was a type of Christ when he was rejected praise the Lord but David did not know that we are SA that he was a type of Christ why because we can look at the life of Jesus and look at the life of David but for David it was a serious matter my son Absalon has kicked me off the throne for David it was a presentence event amen but for God he God was playing out something in the life of David that will speak about Christ are we together so you see the word the word of God that God promise concerning the rejected King praise the Lord at the time for that word to be fulfill God got a man after his own heart called David praise the Lord because if you don't if you don't balance it if if David was predestinated then every part of his life was no that's the reason why it goes back to Redemption amen Joseph was a perfect type of Jesus he was rejected by his brothers he was put into prison and there were two criminals in prison with him praise Lord you look at the life of Joseph it was a perfect time but when Joseph came to the place and told a lie that was not a type of Jesus amen amen and because it was not a type of Jesus it was not a predestinated seed at that time are you understanding it praise the Lord because you see this is the thing that makes people caress in their Christian walk well if I would go to hell I would go to hell if God know I would go to hell if I will go to heaven I will go to heaven God know I will go to heaven so what I should do God knows but you don't know praise the Lord he knows but you don't know and if he's determined he might drag you on the ground just like he made NEC H Nebuchadnezzar to eat grass because God was determined to show his power praise the Lord that's why God sometimes keep people on sick bed they are all in pains because he don't want to lose them he want to give them an opportunity to stay right on that bed and repent of all their sin praise the Lord when we have the grace to be conscious of our life and live the best that we can do for God sometimes we get into a very silly thought all because we our mind is the way you understand predestination is pre-existence you did not preexist it no it was God's thought in his mind praise the Lord and that thought of God was spoken by a prophet a world went out and God was looking for the bride just like Abraham sent a messenger to look for the bride when El Isa went he did not know who would be the bride he just went looking for the woman amen I want to find a woman for my master son Isaac need to be married he is the he of the home he was just goinging praise the Lord hallelujah I I'm I'm I'm I sure believe that he saw a girl that he likes and said let me observe this one he watched her for the while and then in tell minute she show another color oh no no no no no no no no no no no praise the Lord in his human s amen there are things that he admire himly there are abilities that we have but that's not what God is looking for no that's not what God is looking for he's looking for a bearing ground for his word that that when that word drop in that bearing ground you will forget about your abilities you will forget about whatever you are and you will say be it unto me according to your word he is I being the seven he prophesied he said oh God let it be let it be I have travel praise the Lord I have traveled with my men and the and the cels and we are tired Lord we have gone days and we have gone days Lord as we rest by the side of this well let it be father that the dam said that would come and show kindness unto us give me to drink and also give my cambers to drink it was a prophecy praise the Lord it was a prophecy he did not instruct it Rebecca no he did not even throw sand to her for her to be able to do it but because he was under a Divine commission the reason why it was so powerful because it was not only concerning Isaac they were also concerning the one that will find the bride for the one that Isaac type praise the Lord amen so when Ela said that God God put his breath behind it praise the Lord he put his breath behind it and the Breath of God cut the word of eler praise the Lord amen Rebecca did not go to the word because there was a stranger there she went to the world because she was doing her daily Duty that's right she was just doing her daily Duty just her daily Duty amen going to fesh water for her house and when she got to the well she saw this man hello sir can I help you do you need water to drink she started initiating everything do you need water to drink can I get some water for you I I'll will save you don't don't worry don't worry she get down where are you coming from you look so tired praise the Lord amen hallelujah and she's fesh in the water and she skiing conversation and she gave him water to drink and and this that and says let me let me give your ca water also oh wow you came a very long journey oh my goodness oh praise the Lord she just going about her normal life but the word the TS of God is overshadowing her conditioning her to bring to pass what God has [Applause] taught Hallelujah do you know what will happen to Rebecca at the end of the day when she sit down and talk wow yes sir that simple guesture brought to a royal home praise the Lord Redemption is not your program that's right salvation is a free gift that is given to you it's not something you can work for glory be to God hallelujah amen you find this thing let's take out first Thessalonians chapter 5 thank you praise the Lord praise the Lord let's take first Thessalonians chapter 5 in and verse 16 you love the Lord amen I sure you do first teson chapter 5 verse1 15 verse uh 16 the scripture says here Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing listen to this for everything give thanks for this is the way of God the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you the will of God where in your father the word of God from your village no the word of God in Christ Jesus praise the Lord Rejoice ever more pray with our season in everything give thanks praise the Lord now you see it that is that is the place sometimes where h h h h uh uh Rel ReliOn trap us because in most thing that what we call the word of God I'm waiting on the word of God I'm praying for the word of God what you call the word of God is just your own desire it's just your own desire it is it is just a stubborn part in you that you don't want to let go praise the Lord because take for example glory be to God Amen someone gave this example and I I appreciate it they said if I say it's the word of God for me to be a singer what happen if I had an accident and I can't sing anymore am I out of the word of God praise the Lord amen if I take that is the word of God for me to be a preacher glory be to God what happened if something happened and I can't stand and preach anymore and I can't talk I'm I out of the word of God praise the Lord now oh you love the Lord God's will thatth if if you look there in Ephesians 3:11 the Bible declared it as his int of purpose God intend of purpose for your life he did now determine it in the career praise the Lord amen or a way of life this is very beautiful and this is very powerful I pray that the Lord can be able to bring it to our hearts this morning praise the Lord hallelujah because when God made us the Bible says he knows the fibus of our body he knows our the intent of our heart he knows what we can bear he knows the the level of our strength and how wonderful and beautiful excellent we were made because we are his handiwork praise the Lord you see that's the reason why the Apostle Paul expressed this thing because uh uh there's a thought behind it and the thought there is there he say in everything give thanks what is that that's your internal purpose that's the reason why you were made you were made to worship praise the Lord so while I'm on the pulpit preaching I must be able to worship God where I find myself I I must be able to so when that condition changed worship do not leave my heart that's right praise the Lord that's the reason why people say oh it was the word of God for me to be here I was supposed to be here that's the word of God now if they lose their position they don't want to worship God anymore because they take the word of God to be a career or a position or a condition that's the reason why the Apostle Paul says who shall separate us from the word of God Amen he said everything work together for good is just conditioning mean to bring more worship when the situation happen is conditioning mean to bring more worship because the word of God is for me to give thanks everything every condition that's what I was made for to worship when I'm broke I worship when I'm fil I worship so when worship is put un condition you put your worship on condition because of your present position you have not found the word of God yet amen praise the Lord you have not found the word of God yet oh hallelujah praise the Lord you love the Lord Michel chapter 6 ver8 the scripture says he have shown thee oh man what is good and what what does the Lord require thee what is God requiring of you praise the Lord amen is a managing director praise the Lord hallelujah realize this realize this that if you are the managing director if they fire you they do not cancel the position amen if it was the word of God for you as soon as they fire you they cancel the position but when they fire you they leave the position that they say for high we're looking for managing director praise the Lord amen then you go start applying somewhere your managing director position is there if it was the will of God for you when you go it do not exist are you getting the are you getting the concept we put all some of these banard things in the place and we fill our mind with it when God is trying to build character in you praise the Lord to bring you to the next level of relationship that's what God is interested in relationship he have shown theee oh man what is good and what does the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with that God praise the Lord where is the pastor position in that amen is the word of God for me to be the pastor of this church when I'm even breaking the word and the church said they don't want me I said no it's the word of God God's internal purpose that we mortal men are trying to reduce to perishable things praise the Lord perishable things the Lord wake us up every morning he gave us birth he gave us strength it's hard for us to quantify that as blessing but let's just buy a car 20 2015 2015 already passed but you buy 2015 car God have blessed me come and see the blessing of the Lord come and see the blessing that 2015 car you dancing for God wake you up every morning he gave you birth he gave you strength you don't see that as blessing we have reduced God to perishable things praise the Lord I don't know who is responsible for this because it's not in my notes I'm completely away from what I'm supposed to be preaching this morning but it's okay amen we'll still have time to preach it praise the Lord hallelujah the breath of Jesus was on this wise this is the way it happened God memory his promise that the seed of the woman will bruise the seing head he kept his promise because that promise is tied to his Plan of Redemption praise the Lord he said the Sea of the woman it had to be a woman oh glory be to God glory be to God you love the Lord the Lord is wonderful his ways are pass funny out he's an excellent God there is no one that is like unto him praise the Lord let's look at a scripture here I will hold this and maybe we close Jeremiah chapter 22 Jeremiah chapter 22 oh God is so good praise the Lord you know why I say God is so good I was struggling to find this verse you find you saw me flipping the Bible I was just praying Lord help me I need to read this thing and as soon as I I flip it I saw it I didn't keep it in my head so God is so good he knows my inability he came to my [Laughter] rescue praise the Lord let's just read this together Jeremiah chapter 22 let's look down there in verse 28 if you want to go back you want to get it you want to get a a a background to this this is jeon is is that was one that was the last king in the David lineage now you have to remember that the promise of God that the Sea of David will sit on the throne is that God's promise church is that God promise amen hallelujah that the seed of David will remain on the throne but Jonah will be one of the last king from the lineage of David physically are we together now you read here in the book of uh uh uh Jeremiah his name is called konah but when you look at the story you go back and relate the story you know that it's talking about jaon the Bible says and this man K is despised h h h u a despised broken Idol this this is this man kah a despised broken Idol is he a v vess wherein is no pleasure amen we spoke about the pleasure of the Lord prospering God find people that his pleasure can prosper in amen the the spirit of the Lord is saying this man he's a vessel where there is no pleasure because of the wickedness that he did let's go ahead a little bit you will see what I'm trying to get to here wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and I cast into the land which they know not this also is by the prophecy about going into Babylon amen oh Earth Earth Earth hear the word of the Lord praise the Lord pay attention if God speaks about you like this you better pay attention better you better you better hold to The Altar and start crying oh F hear the word thou said the Lord right here this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of David and ruling anymore in Judea now this is what I want to get to you you can write that down you can I mean you must highlight it in your Bible because it's very very important this is where I want to get to you this is the seed of David and God is saying that this man will not have a son to sit on the throne of David how is David lineage going to go how is the lineage of David going to continue when the when the when the when the Lord already told David that there will always be a man that will sit on the throne and this is the last lineage of David and the a curse is coming on him that he's going to be childless he will not have no son so how will the Sea of David continue to the Millennium do you see the importance of the Virgin birth when the natural lineage has filed when the natural lineage has been cursed God through a supernatural birth bring for a son that is Lan to the lineage of David through Joseph and through [Laughter] Mary praise the Lord when the natural lineage has failed God is saying he will not have a son there will not be a seed after him to inherit the throne how would D David lineage continue God has condemned this man you see God there is a place where God come he comes to the end of your fleshly limit there's a place where God comes to and he comes to the the end of all the things that run through your blood and when the seed of God through the birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost when that thing take over praise the Lord all our lineage our our our our our family spirit and family mind we bring everything subject to the word of God because everything go back to the curse praise the Lord that natural that natural birth line was a curse praise the Lord because everything go back to the S and Eve in the Garden of Eden every man born of a woman is born in sin shap in iniquity how could God raise up a seed for the melian the birth of Jesus was on this wise for God to get get a seed of David he must find a virgin that is not connected to the birth of curse he must provide his own seed because he promised in Genesis that the seed of the woman I will give the woman a seed and she he will bruise the sepin head praise the Lord you see the importance of the Virgin birth not the Virgin Mary I'm not talking about the importance of the Virgin Mary I'm talking about the importance of the Virgin birth glory be to God Amen Mary herself understood it she understood it glory be to God she honors to it at the wedding of Cana she came to Jesus he said woman what should I have to do with thee she understood it praise the Lord she went and told those guys you go asking whatever he tell you to do you do it praise the Lord she honors to it she found her way to the upper room to receive the Holy Ghost because she knew she did not have no fleshly attachment to that child praise the Lord the Virgin birth the birth of the word comes when all our Earthly lineage has fail because there is no I don't care what family you born in amen father preacher you know mother prophetes what whatever family you born in we all born in sin ship in iniquity if God will bring forth his life in US is not something we inherit from our parents my grandfather was a preacher yeah he was a preacher God bless his ministry God he did not pass it on through his his his natural gen no when God bring forth his children he bring forth his children he meets you and he gave you a personal experience it does not travel through your your family line say we see in David line the word of the Lord yeah oh Earth this is very important God saying Earth inhabitants of the earth listen I have cursed this line there is no seed from from this line will sit on my promised Throne so if there was not a virgin birth we will not have a maiah the king the The Throne of David will never continue in the Millennium because God has cursed that natural bloodline and that's what the Holy Ghost brings to the believer glory be to God when the Holy Ghost comes it comes to destroy the curse of your natural bloodline it comes to lift that curse from honor you praise the Lord it comes to break that curse you find Christians that uh uh uh have all of these all of these funny funny thoughts and funny uh uh things you know uh uh uh you know in that in their house uh you know there used to be this thing used to happen there so since I went there and my whole life is uh that the life of God in you that you a son and the daughter of God when God spoke to his first son his first children he said have dominion that's why he told him amen praise the Lord if you are not having Dominion is because your birth has not come yet if you are stay afraid you know that is the wichcraft then that my mother that my your birth has not come you are stayed tied to that natural birth line that's the reason why the curse is haunting you because when the Holy Ghost come it CAU you from that curse the word of God says you are a new creature in Christ Jesus all things are pass away and behold all things are new I don't know what I've done maybe is my family people maybe your family you're not the thing that you're doing that you don't know is that you're not taking your walk with God serious praise the Lord you are not having relationship with the god you claim to worship that's the reason why fear is haunting you praise the Lord hallelujah we could open another chapter but the Lord has been good to us you love the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of praise [Applause] hallelujah what a wonderful Jesus that's what God will do for us that's the reason why he's bringing a new generation a people that are birthed by the spoken word praise the Lord that's why we gravitate our life to what the word have said just like Mary be it unto me according to your word I don't understand how this will happen but I believe it praise the Lord I believe it why because the presence of the Angel arrested her and he says the Holy Ghost will overshadow you for the believer the Holy Ghost will condition you when God is taking you through things he's using those things to condition you so his word can come to pass in your life you are not the one that have the steering wheel let me tell you you better sit back and enjoy the ride you don't have the steering wheel praise the Lord before Tesla came up with no Wheel car God already had it you have been in a car that you don't have a steering because the steering is in God's hand and then when he pull you down the path you jump through the window you will break your neck praise the Lord because this this speed limit is so fast it's an intenal speed limit is running so fast that time can't catch up with it praise the Lord people are jumping out I don't believe as soon they don't believe when they get down they they turn to homosexuals they jump out I don't believe that's what Paul said Romans chapter one he said because they are denying the visible creation of God they are enjoying God's creation and they are denying that he exists he say so God has given them over to reprobate Spirit the Lord bless you musicians you can count [Applause] hallelujah oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus Jesus Jesus there is something about your name [Music] Jesus Jes Jesus there's just something about your [Music] name master [Music] Savior [Music] Jesus like the fragrance after the rain oh
