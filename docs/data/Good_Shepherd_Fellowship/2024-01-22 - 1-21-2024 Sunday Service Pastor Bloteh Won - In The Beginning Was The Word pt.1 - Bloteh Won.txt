your word break it to our our hearts speak to us Lord father in a way that our souls will understand in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your [Music] seat I think I try to to change uh the subject but it's the same subject so I just Ted yesterday am I I might just uh uh uh go back and change everything to in the beginning was the word and then let it just be uh different different uh Parts part one part two part three until we can be able to get over it because I realize I might soon run out of path I mean run out of title if I don't keep it that way but this morning we want to go back to our subject that we begin from uh from the beginning of the year in the beginning was the word and I want to do a review I want to throw us back a little bit uh to say that that uh uh we started looking at this subject uh uh uh bringing to our attention that John uh got this uh introduction to his book uh writing his account of the Lord Jesus he got this introduction because he was greatly affected by the things that he saw uh on the island of pmos and uh we know John was in prison we took a portion of that uh uh when we were speaking on uh uh prisoner of love we show how John was he was he was praising on the island of Patmos uh uh for the word of God's sake so he being there for the word of God you have to remember that was that's the time where the church was under persecution so John being there for the word of God uh uh he received this visitation from our lord Jesus praise the Lord thank you thank you thank you sister Grace she's our technician back there so she want to make sure that I have m m uh laser or whatever it is praise the Lord amen I wish I can be comfortable to to preach that way it makes it easy but um I'm still learning now so uh uh John uh uh from from that experience that he had on the on the island of Patmos uh it inspired him to write his report about his his uh his time with Jesus and also he wrote three other episodes that is first John 2 John and third John and then we identify the Revelation chap chapter 3 verse4 was where he took that introduction from when he saw Jesus introducing himself to the Lish Church age which is our age that we are living in the Lord Jesus introducing himself as the amen the faithful and the truth witness and the beginning of the creation of God praise the Lord so John took that and then in St John he opened his writing with in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God he did the same thing when he was writing his his three uh episode to the church he says uh uh that which we have heard from the beginning that which we have seen that which we handle with our hands the word of life we declare unto you now so uh this morning uh uh uh Wednesday night if you if you follow uh uh closely you realize that uh uh we've been we've been going in the in the book of First John that's where we've been traveling because uh uh there was something that I saw if you if you read through the book the entire three episode of John first John 2 John third John you will realize there are Set uh uh uh scriptures you realize uh they are setting uh uh Amma try to see if I can get this thing going in the way that is supposed to or else I will I we ask the technicians to help me uh Grace if you just drop down to the seven references of the beginning no that's that's not okay yeah that that would be that slide so if if you look here you will see that in in John episod he used that same title in the beginning and he speaks seven times of the beginning in in in uh in in uh uh 1 John 1 he said that which was from the beginning we spoke on that and uh uh actually if you read through the entire episode it's more than seven but it's classed into seven because there was seven things that he were addressing I will come back to this there was seven thing that John was addressing but John came to this form of writing because of the impact that the pmos vision had to him had on him praise the Lord on on the island of pmos as Jesus was dealing with John and revealing to John it turned out that John saw a bunch of servants praise the Lord he saw a bunch of servants most of the things that that that the Lord was revealing to him seven Church ages seven golden l seven angels and seven you know uh there were just a bunch of sevens I will show that to you but the reason why uh is because that impacted and a influence John that in all of his writings you will always see a group of sens praise the Lord amen so uh uh let's let's get away from there let's go to our second slide and uh let's let's take the slide by by numbers and that that would be easy for our technician brother BR mentioned the same thing yet in Gabriel Vision he says we find out that there's seven fives in the Plan of Redemption seven fives which mean seven five times in the Plan of Redemption he says five is the number and there's five s Seven Seals seven spirits seven angels seven trumpets seven Church ages so you see the five seven is Grace five is Grace and seven is perfection praise the Lord when we go to our next slide you will see a bunch of servants you will see a bunch of things that John saw while they on the Outland of pmos praise the Lord amen if we just go to our next slide good so you will see here there a bunch of sevenant you realize that uh John spoke about a seven Church ages seven letters seven spirit of God the the Golden Lamb stand seven seven stars in the right hand Seven Seals he talks about seven horn on the Beast he talks about seven eyes he talks about seven angers seven trumpet seven Thunders seven head on the Beast seven Crown seven pledges uh uh uh uh no go back praise the Lord amen amen I don't know whether you did it or I did it sorry seven plagues he talks about Seven Hills he talks about seven Kings and uh in Revelation chapter 7 and then at the last he talks about the seven last vision so you see John saw just just imagine he's going from One Vision to another vision and to another vision and you you should also realize that uh he's a Jewish boy he knows the significant of the number seven praise the Lord amen he knows the significant of the number seven and here is God revealing to him and showing him the vision of the future church and and and and he's seeing all of these sevens praise the Lord there was some the angel interpreted to him the the the seven star in in in the right in my right hand represent the seven messenger the seven golden candlesticks represent the seven churches and he and he saw all of these servants praise the Lord let's go to the next slide now so if you read the Gospel of John you will find that that John has seven I am in John 6:48 he spoke about I am the bread of light the bread of life I am the light of the word I am the do I am the Good Shepherd I am the resurrection of the of of life I I I am the way the truth and the life I am the True Vine praise the Lord the next Slide John also spoke about seven miracles that Jesus did which of course at the end of the book he said there are many things that that Jesus did if if I should write it we will not have a book that's right praise the Lord but he choose to take seven of them praise the Lord now the reason why I'm I'm bringing this to you before I preach is to show you the influence the way we are impacted by the things we see the things we hear the things that been preached to us John now coming to write his book write his report he's being more influenced by The Vision on the island of Patmos than his 3 and 1 half years with the Lord Jesus he walked with the Lord Jesus on the shore of gilee he went on Mount Olive they Rod the boat together they slept together they ate together but just this time that John will have on the island of pmos have impacted him so much praise the Lord so he's he he he he he mentioned seven miracles or seven signs that that happened under Jesus ministry and you you'll be you you'll be strange enough I mean it will be strange enough to let you know the other things I I just thought that I should not uh spend my whole time uh uh trying to gather all of these things but there there there are a lot of other things that John also also gather praise the Lord there were there were other things that he also gathered uh I just I just kept them in my in my own note not to make a slide of them he he also gather he uh uh uh the five the five feet of of Jesus you you you read you read John gospel you will see John make mention of uh of uh the seventh Feast you know Jesus participating in the seventh Feast that Moses gave the children of Israel John was the only gospel that uh that mentioned there you see also how 7 times right in right in St John chapter 1 seven times John spoke about uh the deity of Jesus Christ right in St John chapter 1 amen and uh uh but it is because the Apostle John was affected by all the bunch of different servants that he sought it changed his life it affected him so much much so he so he started putting things in the context of seven when he want to preach he preach seven series praise the Lord amen I hope I can make this seven praise the Lord but I'm not John so don't uh don't hold me by it amen I'm not John but that that is just to give you uh H kind of an Insight on what we are looking at here so you will see now we were we were talking about let's go to the next slide we were talking about uh the seven references of the beginning just like I said if you read first John uh uh over to third John uh John put this expression of the beginning he put it in uh uh uh uh you know in the in in the context of using the seven times and and that is what that is what what is attracting me to this subject that is what is attracting me to the subject if you remember we spoke on that which was from the beginning and uh uh uh last Wednesday we spoke on the Commandment the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning now in uh 1 John chapter 2:3 which of course we will deal with today that's where we will be this morning you'll be talking about right onto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning praise the Lord John here he's he he's making us to see something that's that's what we will get into I don't want to go ahead of myself but what what John is bringing out here let's let's let's let's talk about the other ones in uh uh 1 John 2:24 he speaks about this he says let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning now remember St John chapter 15 Jesus said if you abide in me and my word abide in you now John was sitting there and hearing Jesus saying this it's easy to think that this guy just want us to do everything he says because Jesus is saying if you abide in me and my word abide in you but after John on the island of pmos he realized that the word was not just the literal saying of Jesus he realized that the world was something completely different he realized that Jesus was talking about the logos from the beginning which of course in St John chapter 17 he says that is the glory that I have with the father from the beginning so now he comes back he take St John chapter 15 if he abide in me and I word abide in you and then he comes and teach the church and says let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning that's the next one we'll be talking on if uh if the Lord if the Lord keep us in the in the inspiration then he goes down again to 1 John chapter 3 he speaks about the devil sinth from the beginning praise the Lord so here he's taking us now to Genesis chapter 3 are we together amen now you you the the the the importance of this is that John is trying to get us rooted in everything that we are dealing with like brother Bram said he says Genesis this is the SE chapter everything that we are dealing with every spirit that we are dealing with all was seed in Genesis all was planted in Genesis so John is taking us back to the beginning if we can be able to Gras it from the beginning if we can see it if we can understand it and then when we are dealing with it now it's it's not going to bother us that much because we know that that it is not just common to us praise the lord it's not just come to us are we together so he takes this and says uh the devil seen it from the beginning for this purpose the son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil now if you think about that you think the Son of God was manifested you will only take it to Calvary praise the Lord amen you will take it to calry but you can see that even in the print the the the the the the the writers they were very they were very very purposefully to make us for this to grab our attention because in every age God manifested a son praise the Lord when Samson came on the scene he was a manifestation of a son to do what destroy the works of the Philistine Goliath was intimidating Israel when David came on the scene it was a manifestation of a son to shut that mouth of a Goliath and you are here as a manifestation of sons and daughters hallu to be able to stum on the work of the devil in this age once again God is going to prove that he have a people praise the Lord amen so it's not something oh the Son of God was manifested and we we just make it only a a manifestation of calvary praise the Lord amen so you see he's he's showing us in the beginning that When sin came in God rose up a standard amen the Bible says Seth was born and man begin to call upon the name of the Lord the generation of Noah there was evil but yet God found favor in the man Noah and he was a Son of God that destroyed the works of the Devil by following God commandment building a boat that seal him through the Judgment are we together so the reason why God called us is not to play church we have a work to do to destroy the works of the devil amen are we together then John comes down again right here he says I love this one 2 John 21:5 he says and now I beset the lady if you go back and read verse one he spoke to the church as the elected lady so John after his experience on the island of pmos he realized that the bride was represented in Eden if Adam had a bride definitely the church is the bride of Christ praise the Lord so now he's speaking to the bride here I Bes such the lady a new commandment which we have from the beginning that we love one another I love that one amen praise the Lord I love that one when we get there you'll see why I love it I love that one praise the Lord and then in the in the last one this is the Commandment which ye have heard from the beginning walk I mean you should walk in it it almost sounds like the first one praise the Lord but it have a little it have a little different context so so that's uh that's the seven reference I was uh uh I I try to take time to work on that just to be able to give you a picture just to be able to give you a picture of how can can you imagine how do you think Noah managed to preach one message for 20 years how you think he did it is the impact of the vision when you are impacted by a vision you don't change your mind nothing change the vision that God revealed to him about building that boat impressed him so much that every time he goes to lay a little wood it look more beautiful wow wow that's why he made when he said six Cubit that's why he glory to God praise the Lord the reason why this book looks boring to us because it have not impacted you yet that's right it have not impacted you if this B hit your life yes sir when you wake up in the morning that's the first thing you will look for how can a man preach a message for 120 years Hallelujah the impact of vision praise the Lord just like the our lord Jesus ministry many people came they were drove by the miracle some came for the food and some came for different thing they have happened in every age most of the people that left Moses they left because well that the see death is coming I don't want my first born to die I might let me jump behind this guy but never got a revelation that's the reason why the god in the wilderness they started stomping and that man fing at him and every one of and all of that and that's the same all of these people that are jumping out of the message don't want to serve God anymore they were just following the crowd the word never imparted them oh let that Asian word impart am let that Asian word impart your life will never be the same right let that anient word impart John was so imparted by the vision that everything he saw he saw seven praise the Lord amen John John had a cross eye to see seven everything he saw he had to take a seven out of it because he was so imparted by the vision praise the Lord so we want to we want to go I take my time I'm not in hurry the year it is still long we will take 1 John chapter 2 verse 13 let's let's go to our Bible now we can start speaking this morning I want I was using that as a bait to be able to get your attention and uh and hope that it will it'll make sense to you praise the Lord and you realize that most of the time I never I never used to I never used to uh I always used to wonder you know uh uh uh when a person just gave their life to Christ most of the time they ask where can I start reading the Bible and I will always hear you know preachers we say start reading the book of John praise the lord it's starting to become more clearer to me why the Book of John amen why the Book of John starting to become more clearer to me more brighter to me why the Book of John are we together amen let that Asian word impart praise the Lord Our Lives will never be the same amen we read uh John said if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all of our sin amen the word can help us to drop our habits praise the Lord not not by memorizing it amen not by memorizing it and and and and trying to St just by getting in constant fellowship and and I and I hope that by by the grace of God the Lord can help us to achieve this what I'm trying to bring to you is not just to bring you a bunch of subject or a bunch of stories you know well no but is to be able to increase your appetite in the word amen to be able to increase your appetite in the word praise the Lord so we go to First John chapter 2 and if you are reading through uh the first second T John uh if it will be a blessing for you because you'll be able to pick up those things they are right there if you don't pick it up maybe the holy spirit will help us to to to make you to see it Now 1 John Chapter 2 he actually started speaking to the fathers but he he he started from verse 12 let's let's take verse 12 now I want you to pay attention now as as said just just meditate upon the word don't don't don't stress your mind and be you know checking all over the place let's just meditate upon the word let's just enjoy the word together I write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven are forgiven you for his name sck praise the Lord I write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake praise the Lord amen let me not go ahead of myself I write unto you fathers and uh and and in Father's year as as we soon see it is is is actually going to address parenting and that's and that's word I'm I'm uh I'm I'm uh inspired to speak on this morning it's actually going to address parenting why because God our father he was the first parent parent who begin in Him Praise the Lord so when we talk about fathers here I want us to be able to see it in that context and not only look at the male but look at parenting praise the Lord because the beginning of the childhood starts from parenting glory be to God and it takes both the father and the mother country contribution some has been given special Grace are we together so that's that's why I want for us to keep our mind on this morning now write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because ye have overcome the weak one then he he take the phrase again he says I write unto you little children because ye have known the father I I have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning I I have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word word of God Abarth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one praise the Lord am amen glory be to God now so H uh uh uh we want to look at that this morning write unto you fathers because you have known him from the beginning just like I said I want to drive in the area of parenting this morning because the word is our parent this word it give birth to you praise the lord it's the word that create created your physical universe and if you are born again you are born again by the Sea Incorruptible which is the word of God so the word is your parent that parent from the beginning was the word are you grapping the picture yes praise the Lord conflict between God and Satan let's take the next slide yeah now God is the infinite God and the infinite God is the Perfection of perfection he knew all things before they ever was and therefore if this infinite God could have looked forward and did and seen the end from the beginning and knew that he who have children on this Earth his own blessed children don't you believe that he will provide for them the best that he could provide now you have to realize the reason why he left being an internal Spirit was to manifest himself to his attributes to bring forth his attributes and we were part of his attributes praise praise the Lord so look down time he knew that we will be here amen praise God and like any parent will do remember I'm saying is that he will surely provide the best thing for them amen and what was the best thing we spoke about that Wednesday night the best thing that God could give his children was his word amen was his word the best thing that he could give them was himself the word yes to be their provider to be their Pro protector for them to be able to enjoy his existence are we together will not you tonight to your children that was uh helpless little fellows who can't take care of themselves don't you struggle and work and do everything that you can to provide the best that you can or able to provide for those children because you are a father a parent and if that's been what I who say the truthness and the thought of an Earthly parent and Parenthood originated in God because he was their first parent praise the Lord he was the first parent and when he say let us make man he says let us make man in our image male and female and God make man M and female he was the first parent are we together and don't you think that God seeing what Satan will be what Satan will do he gave to his children and provided for them the best thing that could be provided for them knowing what the enemy attack would be God fortified his children praise the Lord he gave them his word we look at 39 words on uh on uh uh Wednesday night that he put them behind praise the Lord you have to realize to Adam that was not a commandment to Adam that was the word of God praise the Lord to Adam it was not like do or don't no he saw it as God's protection praise the Lord no matter what you know that thou shall not Ste means no matter what you know whatever you have understand that thou shall not steal means to God is more than that praise the Lord no matter what you know what explanation you can give to thou shal not lie well no matter what explanation you can give to you it will just be a regulation something you can do if you if I do it okay this will happen if I don't do it this will to you that's what it means to God is more than that amen it's more than that just telling a lie is more than that why because to him he's the spirit of truth it's not traced back to him it's not his nature praise the lord it's not part of his economy while you and myself just look at it as said do or done God look at it more than that that's the reason why Jesus when he came he could say in the Lord it was telling you thou shall not commit adultery but I say unto you right that if you look at a woman and lost after her so Jesus was trying to say to you the Lord was given and to your understanding it limited you but to me almighty God I look wider and deeper than than than what your mind think thou shall not kill thy brother but he that hated his brother without a curse yes sir God says it runs deep he says to me my word runs deep are we together so you see it in parenting the success is never rules and regulation so the Commandment in the beginning we read that in Genesis i' like to go back and and and give you a review but before I finish reviewing my time will be off praise the Lord amen John spoke there we we saw it the Commandment from the beginning he says uh the old commandment from the beginning a new commandment I gave you is not a new commandment is the same old commandment from the beginning and we look there in Genesis chapter 2 where we saw that uh uh H uh and God commanded Adam of every tree of the garden you will eat first time that word will come up in the scripture command it but what I'm what I'm trying to show you here is that it was never taken as a commandment because God don't give commandment to his children like the way we think Exodus chapter 19 when God brought up brought out the children of Israel he never gave them a commandment the law was not gave to them they requested for the Lord they are the one that told God all that the Lord God said we will do God said really really okay Moses come up here yeah come come come up here really are these people telling me that everything I said they would do praise the Lord this finite mind these people that are with limited conscience right these people that cannot see past their nose they are the one telling me that everything I said they would do okay come up here come come I gave you two stones praise the Lord two stones it's it's very beautiful when you look at it uh uh you know we were reading through the Bible there and and uh I was kind of showing the case there how God will gave the Egyptians 10 plagues and gave his people 10 commandments praise the Lord I don't want to go into there let's let's stay right here so you see the the word was never it was never God intention to give his children laws because you don't parent with laws laws don't parent right yeah laws don't parent whenever laws start coming out that's when Rebellion starts praise the Lord are we together so for the very fact that the people who says all that God says we will do it was a sense of rebellion brother brandham says they despise Grace and the ask God for Lord he says that was the most the most fatal mistake that Israel ever made right to stand before allmighty God and say I can keep your word you see me I'm a Believer I can keep your word liar are we together amen the principle of parenting can never be established by laws laws are to govern Rebellion people the reason why we have law because we are living in a lawless country right if there was no stopway sound here we would be hearing cars knocking themselves on that Junction there just now because everybody is in the hurry everybody is in the Hur are we together amen parent who originated in God because he was the first parent are we together amen and I'll take this one also okay still doing well all of my time trying not to keep you long identify masterpiece he says now if anybody had has something that you wanted to do real nice I will much rather you do it to my children than to than to do it to me and so I feel maybe as a parent and he is the source of Parenthood now he's bringing this thought of how God want us to treat his children while he said one word spoken against the church will not be forgiven he's bringing that thought along to make us to understand that just in the natural as a natural parent will feel the sense of feeling that you will have when you know that someone has been kind to your child he says that is the same way the almighty God that sense of feeling comes from God right praise the Lord that sense of feeling comes from God can you imagine what almighty God fell when his first daughter was abused by the serpent praise the Lord do you do you think that it was a joyful thing for the Creator when he could stop it praise the Lord when he could stop it you see that's that's another thing about parenting God allow it because he was bringing his children to be partaker they were part they were part of his inheritance they were part of his work of redemption so even though he could stop it yet he stood back praise the Lord showing how in parenting he include his children he include them right after he made everything he said Adam you need it you go ahead and name it what what should I call it I don't know you name it he says I'll say lying he said that just what I was thinking about right I call this one line beautiful beautiful son beautiful that's what Jesus teaching the Lord's Prayer he says when you prayed When you pray every time you get on your knees to pray take yourself back to your beginning goes back to your beginning you are not standing before a judge you not standing before a god that is ready to whip you that's what John is all about in this book for us to be able to trace ourself back because if you don't do it you will just be caught up in religion and you will never get into True Fellowship with God sir because you will be limited by the church yes sir he says whenever you pray says our father my father the one from whom I began yes oh it is true it's a recitation to many of us so it's hard to connect with it but just keep reciting it keep reing it it become real to you just keep reciting it fall in love with the Lord's Prayer amen amen praise the Lord I took I take it as a secret home we say the Lord's Prayer every morning after we pray because there is something that I come to know about it that have changed my life many years ago he is the source of Parenthood I think that that's the way God feels if we should we we serve him as we serve each other we serve him as we serve each other the devil is the most selfish beast on Earth it's all about him and him alone how much he can kill how much he can destroy right it's all about him but with God it's him in his attributes praise the Lord amen man I mean I mean such a Spain here right now I'm feeling so good I'm feeling so good and the reason is because I'm lifting up the Parenthood of my father that's your beginning that's your beginning you can trace yourself back to your village Trace yourself back to but that's that's the beginning of the universe praise the Lord I hope I won't keep you too long let's take one more quat and then we can start preaching I have not started yet amen my tongue almost roll in my mouth and I bite it Ephesian parallel Joshua glory be to God now he's Jehovah Jehovah means the one who exists with his family there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self existence but now now so you see when you go back to Genesis 1 and you take that word h uh uh let me let me go back there I thought I was going to do some a kind of a layout for for for us this morning to be able to to to expressed there Genesis Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make men now the reason why that has become h h h a subject of contradiction all through the word is because Thy word God is Elohim that word that is used there in the Hebrew is Elohim and Elohim the word Elohim the the spelling Elohim that spelling e l o m r no h i Am is that right am I spelling it right okay if I'm wrong say you are wrong that spelling is in the plural yes sir it's in the plural let let me let me also show you something that if if you look at closely you look in the Bible you will see that uh when you talk about one cherub cherubin if you talk about one it's a cherub if they are more than one they are cherubin but without s that's right okay that's right it's a PR form so the same way yeah God meanings Elohim going back to his state of being self-existence dwelling with all his attribute God so the context was not wrong when he says let us right amen right are you seeing the picture sir because if you want to be if you want to teach me English then explain this to me put up Genesis 1:26 for me praise the Lord you know you know you will beat me you know you will beat me so if I'm if I'm calling you to this play you must know I really did my homework because on any grammar you're going to beat me praise the Lord but watch this the Bible says and God which of course this God is what is Elohim in the Hebrew said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fishes of the seed okay go to 27 27 is where where my and God Elohim created man in his now if he said let us then why it is his year no it's supposed to be so God created man in our image amen are you seeing the picture amen praise the Lord now the the reason why I I said that is because when you read Genesis you will see that uh uh uh word God and Lord is used it brings out uh uh uh uh the the the attributes of God Amen because in Genesis chapter two you'll find that uh uh uh the Lord God commanded man you hear there in Genesis 2 that Genesis 2:16 the Lord God commanded man now is no longer God is is is the Lord God praise the Lord now which bring us to what we were reading here that's the reason why I went into all of that that places for you let's go back to Ephesian parallel Joshua here I can be able to express some few things to you and then we close and now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family there he is God Jehova the one who once existed in self-existence but now exist with his family and his little ones with him praise the Lord God condescending the great Elohim condescending and he's breaking out himself taking his attributes from from from in him expressing it and it's also going to the word so God's mind of creation and Redemption praise the Lord God's mind of creation and Redemption because you realize that those are the two things that God used to speak to people people all the people that don't believe in his his Redemptive work they somehow believe in his creation praise the Lord Paul brought that out beautiful in Romans chapter 1 you know what he said he said because they refuse to acknowledge Him as God when they invisible things declare that he exists when man can go on the moon and the stars and and they can look at the gaces and all of that all of those things you don't have to read the Bible if you don't want her what is written in the Bible here is only about Redemption the story of redemption is right here the story of of creation is all around you it's all around you praise the Lord so Paul says in Romans chapter 1 because man has refused to acknowledge God that's the reason why he turned them over to a rebellious spirit for them to misuse their own body when men deny you want to enjoy the the the the creation and deny the Creator Paul says that's the reason why God has turned them over to all the filed Spirit man with men and women with women and all of that it's a it's it's a it's a it's it's a national curse it's a it's it's it's is it's an abominable curse to the Earth the same way when man did not acknowledge God in the days of Noah he he he sent a FL and WEP out the the the the the whole existence of man that is the same thing he's doing this time it's not a flood it's a spirit it's a Gil lesbian and all sorts of filthy spirit that is just roing the mind of man they turning himself to beast and I mean all sorts of things they are doing with them is when man do not acknowledge their creator Hallelujah when Nebuchadnezzar did not acknowledge that the power that brought Israel on him was all Mighty God God turned him to a beast seven years he ate grass like a beast praise the Lord forget about Redemption you'll forget about Redemption for the fact that you are alive you are alive there is a God that give you birth am amen amen you forget about I'm not forcing you to church you don't have to come to church you don't have to serve God because you can't serve him until he call you that's the five with Redemption I'm talking about your existence and God says if you fail to acknowledge that he will make you to turn against your own nature you will do the very things that don't make sense to you that's why you will do to your own body when man does not acknowledge God as a Creator praise the Lord oh I'm so glad we can acknowledge Him as our creator we can acknowledge Him as Our Redeemer we can acknowledge Him as our savior the Bible says the heaven declare the glory of God the farmer man speaks of his hand work praise the Lord why because they are his creation they appreciate appreciate being created so they have to express it you don't appreciate Redemption that's why you want us to beg you to come to church we must beg you to come to church brother you need to be in church sister please you need to serve God you don't appreciate Redemption my if you appreciate Redemption and you know what it took on Calvary to pay the depts that you couldn't have paid praise the Lord you won't wait for the doors to be open that's what the prophet said parenting God when uh uh uh John can't can you imagine John de Revelation chapter 5 no man is worthy to open the book John wept he cried glory be to God but when one of the elds came and said John why are you weeping what are you weeping the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed praise the Lord John trying to WP his eyes and look around to see where the lion is he saw a larm the Bible says he shouted he shouted his Str he says all them in in the in in the heavens he me the ones in the earth he me if if there was hearing ears anywhere to hear me hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah why because he saw his Redemption amen he could trace himself back to the lamb in the beginning so it's very important it's very very important to John right here sending us back to the beginning trying to tell you says that's where your foundation is praise the Lord that's where your found age that's where the the the seed that was planted is back there in the beginning are we together amen so John with everything that he saw on the island of pmos this whole thing about the beginning of the creation of God just got his mind he says oh my God that's where this whole thing is coming from this whole thing called Redemption this this whole thing called the uh uh the gospel I breaking your thing that's okay this whole thing and he says that's what is coming from it's coming from the beginning if we can go back to the beginning amen praise the Lord if we can go back to the beginning hallelujah amen so he picked this up fathers fathers you have known him that is from the beginning first he talk about children little children your sin are forgiven you I was going to read a quote of brother Brandon where he talks about you know when the child is born and died you know to go right to Heaven John was making us to understand that he and and so he talks about the three classes he talks about the children and uh those are the innocent ones he talks about the Parenthood and he also talks about our young age that's where the fighting is the ones that supposed to fight is that one that's what he said you have overcome the evil one young men are right unto you you have overcome the that's where the fighting is the little ones they are under the blood amen the blood speaks on their behalf when you get to that age of consciousness praise the Lord that's when you should start fighting I don't mean fighting in school young people that's not what I mean I mean fighting fighting your you know trying to to to to get yourself together amen you can even fight to make your bed fight to keep your room clean right are we together but this is this is what I want this is what I want to I I want for us to see before we close here there is just so much in here so much in here so much in here that I want for us to for us to be able to to look at here he's taking us back to the beginning uh father's parent you have known him from the beginning praise the Lord the twice that he spoke about the children the young men he repeated the same thing to the parent that's that was the thing that grabbed my attention that John is addressing more than just a father year he's he's addressing a state of being he's addressing Parenthood glory be to God amen amen and as I thought about that I thought about the effect of our society and I will say that and I will say it to every one of us we are we are in such a Time living in such a Time word you know you try to look at these words sometimes they don't give you what what is in the depth of your mind but I was trying to look at the difference between training and education you look at education it tells you it's a form of training but there is one word that's that stuck out to me it says intellectual praise the Lord amen amen the one word that stuck out to me is said intellectual and uh uh but I believe there is there is a difference I believe that uh uh as as parent uh uh the the role of parenting is our responsibility to train our children by the word of God that's what the word of God says train up a child we all know that we can say that uh at the back of our head proverb 22:6 that is our god-given responsibility to train our children but you see we are in such a culture that is Twisted things around that's right and that's why we having the kind of a problem that we having with the generation because the generation is left to the society to train them they are supposed to go to school to have some intellectual ability to read and write and be able to reason but when it comes to training is almost the difference between discipline and Punishment M right yeah praise the Lord you don't send you don't allow your child to go to praison to be disciplined there is no discipline in praising in praising is punishment right right praise the Lord in in praising is punishment they don't eat the food they want to eat they don't wear the clothes they want to wear it they having time for it's it's punishment praising don't discipline but you see when when when we lose our ability or the grace or even the children despising The Godly discipline that is given to them then God ordered the state to take over from them there is just there is just a Twist the whole thing that's that's the that's what this generation all over the world that's that's what the the generation is dealing with why because that Parenthood that sacred virtue from God that he that he instored in Us in bringing for life to the Earth we have despised it we have despised it and we just think that well if we can get them into into NY let's send them to n NY 2 three years okay let them go 4 hours they come back and and as long as they go you know what what you learn in school to the ABC oh yeah the child know how to say they ABC and and all of that and but you realize that uh all of the time from from that age of six years until they will be facing their future they will be in the hands of someone that will be playing with their mind right yes sir they will not be reading Bible to them they will be telling them what the society what this Society what the society really your parents doing that to you really sir are we together amen when you are training you are imparting praise the Lord you are impacting and the truth stands that you can't give what you don't have that's right you are impacting Hallelujah when you are educating you are reasoning you are reasoning that's the reason why they have two different three different approach to one solution it's reasoning amen it's reasoning the the the teacher the instructor never comes down on you and say you have to do it like this no he okay you do you don't understand it that way okay let me bring it another way that's right praise the Lord amen now that's the the place where most of the uh you know we we would think and we believe that all you know uh the message was against education you know no no no the prophet of God told us we need it he said we need it to put bread on our table praise the Lord but he also instructed us that it must not take the place of the word it must not take the place of the word word are we seeing it are you seeing the picture Genesis 18 verse 19 let's run through this quickly before I lost my time here praise the Lord the time is already on Me Genesis 18 verse 19 God speaking to Abraham he's saying to Abraham I will not hide nothing from my servant Abraham why he says because I know he says I know that man I know him for I know him that he will command yes sir his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord yes sir God is is is identifying that ability of parenting Ela was not Abraham's son but Isa was parent by Abraham so much that he knew what Abraham wanted for a wife to his son that's parenting praise the Lord look at this you you appreciate this you can take the verses down and Deuteronomy chapter 4: 10 chapter 6 verse 7 11 verse 19 31 verse 19 you will see that over and over if you can put up if you can just put put put uh for verse 10 you will see over and over when the children of Israel was about to go into the promised land there was something that Moses emphasized over and over love to read that Deuteronomy 4:10 let's read that if we can we just run through it 4 verse 10 the scripture says here when the Lord said unto me gather me did I give you the right one okay yeah yeah it's somewhere down here the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me in all the days all the days that they shall live upon the Earth and that they may teach their children chapter 6 verse 7 chapter 6 verse 7 6 verse 7 and thou sh teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sth in the house and when thou walth by the way you know I was I was reading this last night I said no we're not walking by the way why you drive in your car praise the Lord amen you go back there that's that's from verse six and these words which I have commanded thee this day shall be in their heart verse seven and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sth in the house and when thou walth by the way and when thou lith down and when that riseth up and thou sh bound them as a signal praise the Lord poor signs of the word around the joy of the Lord is our strength if this house the Lord built this house amen you know uh uh uh let let let let let it become something that that capture the mind of the children amen praise the Lord why because he knew that they were going Among The Strangers of the land amen they knew that that there were there there were evil influence out there with the inhabitants of the land praise the Lord these people they they not have the instruction of the Lord there were a lot of evil out there I I want to go into all all of the things to to uh spoil your mind you look you look in uh uh uh chapter 11 verse 19 chapter 31: 19 you will see the same the same sense of faith is that sense of paren hold that John was referring to in the beginning father you knew him in the beginning there there there there was something that he said at the end we will come to death when he talked to the children you know what he said he said children for thou have known the father praise the Lord Brother Bram said it's almost like the drunken man struggling as he's going home and when he looked back he saw his son going like this that's right he says John what are you doing He says Dad I'm walking in your footsteps that's right look it's uh you know we can we can take this as said as a Simon preach pray and go home but until we come to the reality yes sir that we are living in a society that is against all our Prin principle this Society is not for you right it's against everything you believe amen praise the Lord am and if it can make you to disbelieve what you believe that's why it's offer praise the Lord I mean they just want to I mean we we can have a church well let's just have a church everybody can come in you know people can come in you know who are naked they can come in any way they want to dress they can come in uh you know with any kind of a lifestyle that's that's the kind of that's the kind we we we are all we are all you know we are all the same until we realize that until we start looking at that very closely that this Society this generation we are in the loss of the land is not in our favor right right the culture is not in our favor praise the Lord y you sisters you know how hard it is for you to get a decent dress the culture is not in our favor are we together amen and when you go over to the Book of Joshua Joshua chapter 4:6 there are a lot of things I wanted to go into this morning I'm just trying to pull myself out a little bit because I'm out of time here you go to Joshua 4:6 you will also find this Moses in Deuteronomy he says teach your children Joshua when they go to the promised land Joshua says when your children shall ask you what is the meaning of this this is what you should say to them when your children shall ask you amen amen when we talk about when Jude talk about let us ear earnestly concerned for the faith if there is one book that describ apostasy one chapter book in the Bible that describe apostasy is the Book of Job Jude when Jude says let's contend for the faith that was delivered unto us he knew what he was talking about amen Jude went into describing the spirit of apostasy until he brought it so much down of how much the body of Moses was fought over when Moses died you think about that if his dead body was fought over what's about your living body every day and night there are demons Waring against Angels over your body over the decision you will make over the next ACT that you will perform living in an age where the spirit of apostasy is on the people and whatever the devil will use to play Down the standard of godliness whatever he will use to play down there's no meaning of praying it's just it's just a religious thing get down father please Lord bless me there is no intimacy he killed it he he he he just he just RAV your mind and you don't see the importance of it it's a spirit of apostasy driving the people away from God only having the form of godliness but the power you can see see it you can see it we get we get pressed oh my God so what happened the spirit of the age and day and time make it so busy we turn our our children over to secular laws to to train them they're going to school oh they're in nth grade in sixth grade oh oh yeah you know they learing this there but then you see that very same child coming with an attitude right in your face no the the fact about the matter that is that until they are born again praise the Lord until they are born again they are going to to to to dance to rock and roll that's what the prophet of God said and he said Rock and Road ISE is preparing them for the battle of amag wow that's what he said praise the Lord and then now the age has Crown it out the crown of this age is artificial intelligence praise the Lord they don't need they don't even need to go anywhere write on their their cell phones or whatever they can know everything that is out there in the world know the latest faction they know about uh all of that I'm saying all of this it is not to beat down on our parenting if you think that's what I'm talking about you got you getting me so wrong I'm saying all of this just to show you what is against us what we have to deal with praise the Lord in all of you all of you young brothers and young sisters that are planning for for future marriage and all of that you better get your you better get yourself back to the beginning praise the Lord that Fellowship that that that I mean just just lay that foundation for yourself like I've always said you know you ask people oh I'm I'm I'm looking for the you know uh a man or the GOL don't look for one be one be one don't look for one be one because when you are one whoever com in yes sir if they are not one they will go back don't look for one be one because what we have against us where our age is treading to the Le is taking out of hell the prophet of God said there 1956 he said demons powers are streaming out into the Earth and we are here living the reality amen Jesus St John Chapter 13 he taught by example this I'm doing to you do it also unto one another the Bible says he learned obedience by the things that he suffer pointing back to his childhood the creator of the universe talk about it of Flesh 12 years old he was in a camping shop see what he was doing he was learning he despised the the the trend of education for that day he could have gone to the Seminary and no he was learning he learned obedience by the things that he suffer and then when he got into his ministry he said learn of me praise the Lord are we together amen are you seeing the picture because if you if if if if we don't see it you think that I'm I'm I'm I'm attacking your your your ability of parenting I'm a parent also I'm I'm seeing my challenges in the shadows because sometimes when when the people don't uh don't don't don't don't grab the inspiration of the Holy Spirit it just become a personal wall and then the truth that's supposed to set us free we start casting it out who are you to say this to me who are you to say this to me what better do you have what better that I mean church should not be like that amen are we together am Jesus Matthew 11:29 learn of me Hebrew 5 he learned learn he obedience I'll bring this to a close right here John was so imparted by what he saw he affected him in a good way that he started to look at even the life of Jesus he started to look at it in a complete different way praise the Lord amen I see when you have a better understanding you don't regret when you understand why you go through what you go through you don't regret it make you more stronger are we together amen hope I said something this morning I will help you in your Christian walk amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen I hope something was said that would draw you closer to the Lord amen hallelujah am amen amen we are given their responsibility as parents we are giving the work as a we are just managing God's children and our job we supposed to be like the int taker when Jesus talk about a Good Samaritan he talk about the int taker was giving two coin to be able to that's that's our job we are just like the int taker we are supposed to take care of them we are supposed to make it easy for them to fall in love with Jesus we supposed to make it easy for them to be able to grab what is this all about praise the Lord amen because until they get their driver license you can you can drag them to church when they get their driver license then they can choose whether they want to come or not praise the Lord amen because of the pressure of the society we don't we don't go in teaching them the values that make us to believe what we believe or stand what we believe we turn to the society the society says well you know uh uh uh you know this this is the this is the trench of dress so the pressure is on the children they want to be like their friends and then because we love them so we turn to that less of our value we give more into death Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 1 chapter 2 Isaiah de with the same thing in his days he said children has become their leaders right no we are called to lead him we are called to lead him and we must be able to stand on the principle of the word doing the best that we can to be able to minister to these young people and help them to see what is this all about what is this all about praise the Lord amen we supposed to be their first Sunday school teacher Sunday school starts from home yeah praise the Lord even right in there where Moses told the children of Israel he says Sing these words unto them he says Sing It unto them that's a reason why you know what when the child come to sing special and the parents get embarrassed about it it's a shame to the parent right your child come to sing special you embarrassed about it it's a shame you never did your work because if you were interested in that you would tell them if you want to sing a song you should tell me so I can tell the deacons oh they say
