And uh uh we thank the Lord for uh just giving giving us a wonderful time. Amen. &gt;&gt; After after our our service there in Arkansas, we had a good meeting by the way. All the brothers Greetings, brother Clay Farmer, brother Ben Dero. We were preaching together and um we had to close the meeting on Sunday. The Lord gave us a wonderful service. Brother Prader, his wife, they all said their greetings and then I just chased right to the airport. So I end up following the service here from the airport while waiting for my flight and and I really really enjoy the presence of the Lord, the word that was preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. So thank you. Thank you for for making it happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because if you were not here, we would not be able to preach. So thank you for coming and thank you for tuning in tonight, everyone that is uh in service with us tonight. Let's take our Bibles and uh and go over to the book of 2 Chronicles chapter 16. 2 Chronicles chapter 16. I realized last week I titled uh preaching on the the seven spirits of God. That was what I wanted to speak on. But then we started talking about God setting the scene. Amen. And uh and and I and I felt blessed because my mind was not in that direction but the Holy Spirit was able to honor your faith. So let's read from 2 Chronicles chapter 16 tonight. We'll read from verse 7. 2 Chronicles chapter 16 tonight. I just want to use this as a scripture reading and uh just to be able to show you uh when we go into what we want to study tonight to be able to show you the reflection of it back in the Old Testament. Verse seven. And at that time Hanel the seer, he was a prophet. He came to the king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Sarah. Amen. And not rely on the Lord thy God or may it not be our our place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. May we not rely on the government. Amen. May we not rely on our job or rely on our finance. Let fully learn to rely on the Lord our God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because thou hast relied on the king of Sarat and and not relied on the Lord thy God, therefore the host of the king of Sarah escape out of thy hand. &gt;&gt; When not uh uhh the Ethiopians and the Lubans a huge host with varied men in char and housemen. Yet because that did rely on the Lord, he delivered them into thy hand. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you see the scene here, the prophet now is telling this king, one time God delivered you when you were surrounded by armies that you could not fight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were surrounded by men. You were surrounded by situation that was greater than you. and God deliver you &gt;&gt; at that time because you were relying on God. &gt;&gt; But this time it looks like it changed and you beginning to rely on the arm of flesh &gt;&gt; and the arm of flesh will surely fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Verse uh nine. For the eyes of the Lord run to and for throughout the whole earth to show himself strong &gt;&gt; and the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him. &gt;&gt; So God is watching over our affairs. &gt;&gt; Amen. If our heart is towards the Lord and we are relying on him, no matter how it see, God is watching over our affairs. There is no one better that can watch over our affairs than God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Because according to the word, four generation before we came here, &gt;&gt; God was watching over you &gt;&gt; in the lens of your great great great grandfather. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because four is the number of deliverance. So four generation back &gt;&gt; uh uh uh you being a seed in your great great grandfather you are you are an attraction to God. God started watching over you four generation before you got here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So why not now? Do we have any better technology to watch over us &gt;&gt; than the one that was watching over us &gt;&gt; before we got here? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Out of the million uh uh cells that came from our father, he was very particular that it has to be this one to meet this egg. Amen. If he was going to miss it, you will not be here. God was very particular because he was watching over you. How much more now? Amen. So let's read this again. For the eyes of the Lord run to and for throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him. Year in thou has done foolishly. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To take your eyes from relying on God and start relying on whatever you are relying on the prophet said you have done foolishly. Amen. Therefore, from hence forth thou shall have wars. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, uh we just want to thank you. We want to thank you, Lord God. And and uh uh and and and Father, we want to we want you to bring us to consciousness of how this is real. The Lord, Father, your eyes, as your eyes are on the spirus, &gt;&gt; so your eyes is watching over us. Surely God is truth because if not, Lord, we would not be here tonight. &gt;&gt; If not, Father, Lord, God, life would not be the way it is for us, Lord. Even though in many cases, Lord, Father, it does not make sense to us. But he that watches over us knows best. &gt;&gt; So, Father, we want to thank you tonight. We want to thank you tonight. Make it real to our hearts Lord as we look into your word and wherever we want to look in tonight. I pray that the Holy Ghost we have the preeminence. Speak to us Lord. May something be said of internal value. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we just we are just happy to be back home. Amen. And uh uh we want to start uh reminding you uh uh uh the first weekend the first weekend in uh in November that would be the I think November 1st and second uh we will have brother brother Forest Farmer but Forest Farmer will will preach for us. Yeah. November 1st and second that is a Saturday night and a Sunday morning service. But far as farmer, brother Brandon prayed for him when he was a little boy. Uh uh he uh he he normally tell tell the tell the story and I always like to play the tape that he was prayed for uh uh whenever he's preaching for us. So I hope I for I don't forget but uh uh I just I just had the burden on my heart to to have him come and speak for us. So he will be here with us on uh November 1st and 2nd. He'll be preaching for us. And then uh on the 5th today, I got a I got a voice uh a message, a WhatsApp message from u from sister Rebecca. That's u uh uh our sister uh from Germany. &gt;&gt; Her uncle uh is traveling to the States. So uh I think down to visit brother Chad Lamb and he wanted to pass through to to see her. So he made contact with us. So uh uh November 5th, that's a Wednesday night like this night. You'll be preaching for us and then you fly out on the weekend to Ohio and then you'll be going back to Germany. He said he wish he had a long time to spend a weekend with us which of course I thought that would have been good to have him for the Saturday night or Sunday morning but once again God want to bless our Wednesday service. Why not take it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Take it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take it. The Lord is mindful of us. Amen. So let's just keep that on our on our time card and remember the first and the second we will have uh I thought uh uh because the 31st that will be Halloween uh uh I thought we uh wanted to do a Friday night service but uh I was not I'm not uh uh for some reason and uh but if if they feed the need uh we will but for now it's Saturday night and on the morning service. Praise the Lord. Amen. I just I just think that uh you know uh Halloween is has has become uh you know uh uh a kind of uh fantasy and uh uh what used to be uh a very evil and uh a demonic thing is now becoming children's play. But those spirits still hangs around. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those spirits hangs around. So, uh I just think that let's just have a service uh and cast those spirits away. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, that's what we will be doing uh uh at the beginning of of November. And uh uh so tonight, I want us to go back to Revelation chapter 5. That's where we've been studying. And uh uh I I thank the Lord the Lord uh been blessing me in uh in enjoying the word uh enjoying in my own study time. So I want to bring some of those blessings to you the best way I can. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5 uh let's read. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof. I was preaching from this year on Sunday but speaking on something completely different that we have spoke here before. And uh uh verse three, an old man in heaven. Okay, verse two, there was there uh and I saw the strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worth it to open the book. Last week we took this back in the book of Romans and we find that Paul also under the Holy Ghost. He said, who shall separate us? Amen. Who shall separate us? Praise the Lord. And he started talking fine, persecution. So we were trying to identify a personality. We were trying to identify a being, a person that is behind all of our troubles. Amen. And we know that person is the devil. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because if you go back to Genesis chapter 3, let's go back to Genesis chapter 3 quickly. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis chapter 3. Look at verse 11. Now God came down in the garden of Eden. Verse 10. And he said, I heard I I heard a voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself. And he said, Who to thee? Who? &gt;&gt; Not what told you. Who? Who told you? So there was a person in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a personality that was behind the fall. &gt;&gt; Who told you? &gt;&gt; Now what told you? &gt;&gt; Who told you? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so you we is uh uh I mean these are principles that we have to watch because if you don't watch these principles you might blame yourself for what you are going through. You might find somebody to blame and you you you will not be able to identify the the the influence the power that is behind whatever you are dealing with. Amen. So now what told you? But who told you? Who is walked to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? No man in heaven, none uh uh in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look there on. I wept much because no man was form worthy to open the book and to read neither to look there on. And one of the elders said unto me, "Weep not behold the lion of the trap of Judah. The root of David has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We will come back to all this, but let's go ahead. And I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the head of stood a lamb as it has been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth in all the earth. The seven homes and the seven eyes are the seven spirits of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is God's word. So we will ask God to our blessing upon his word tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So tonight we want to look at the seven spirits of God. Amen. We want to look at the seven spirits of God. Praise the Lord. Because yet the scripture tells us that the seven spirits of God are the seven horns and the seven eyes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now uh we just read a scripture to you where back in the book of Chronica this king uh this prophet was talking to the king and says because you are not relying upon God. Let me tell you, the eyes of God goes to and for throughout the earth. Praise the Lord. And we know that is the that is the position of a prophet. He's an eye of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the reason why I read that scripture is to be able to show us that this is not just only a New Testament concept. It's a concept that that is all through the scripture. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and A very beautiful thing I saw when I was I was studying that I I'd like to share with you as we as we go on. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, back when brother Brandon preached the the the seven church ages, uh beside the the uh the exposition series, he said this in the seven church ages, he said, "Now the seven spirits that are before God, these seven spirits was represented as the seven spirit that will be sent forth from the seven church ages. Seven spirit before God we could pick up from the Old Testament and pick it up there if we just had time. So the reason I read this to you again to show that the seven spirits is not just only a New Testament concept or just a a book the book of revelation concept but it is something that I can go because if you read in revelation chapter 5 the Bible says something there when it talks about the seven spirit of God what what did it say? They said, "Having seven homes and seven eyes, which are the seven spirit of God, sent forth into what did the Bible says? &gt;&gt; All the earth. All the earth." So all the earth is not only revelation. All the earth is not only New Testament. All the earth means from the beginning of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the beginning of time. So, brother Brandham is showing us here that we can go back to the Old Testament. Now, the reason why we will not be able to to uh to to identify the reason why we will not be able to identify definitely a seven spirit or a seven church ages in the Old Testament. They were all they are there. They are just in types and shadow. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are just there in types and shadows. This is this is this is what that really hit me when I was studying this. You look in uh in uh uh uh mh John chapter 7. St. John chapter 7. The Bible says at a at a great feast something happened. St. John chapter 7. If we just want to look there quickly. Praise the Lord. St. John chapter 7. Now that's that's from verse 37. And at at at the at the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, "If any man test, let he come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture have said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's saying as the scripture said, so which mean we can go back in the Old Testament and find this &gt;&gt; that is a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. That out of his belly will flow rivers of water. We don't have time to go back there. But this is what I want to bring you now. But they speak he of the spirit. Now Jesus was speaking of the Holy Ghost. He was speaking of the Holy Spirit which they that believe on him should receive. For the Holy Ghost was not g was not yet given &gt;&gt; because Jesus was not yet been glorified. So all of that was in one man. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And until he leave, it will not be released. Now, so you can you can take that as a comparison that they have it in in in in types and shadow. They never had it in the way that it is identified in the New Testament because they were under the blood of bulls and goat. &gt;&gt; Amen. So everything that was in the Old Testament was on a shadow is there but it's on a shadow &gt;&gt; and and and something that is on a shadow. When you see a shadow, you cannot properly identify the item because it's a shadow. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can identify it's not a shadow, that's the reason why Paul would say is that the Old Testament was a shadow of good things to come. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, the seven church ages was in the Old Testament as a shadow. &gt;&gt; The seven seals were in the Old Testament as a shadow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was in the Old Testament as a shadow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, it is not just a New Testament thing. &gt;&gt; No, we're talking about the five for ministry. It was in the Old Testament as a shadow. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost was not given yet. That's that is just the principle. When the Holy Ghost was given which mean God has pou then things started to become more clearer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because men are now honor the the sacrifice. That's the reason why every year they had to go back and sacrifice. Amen. Every year they had to go back make a confession of their sin, carry a lamp, make a sacrifice. Every year they have to go back because they were just under a shadow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But under the new covenant, the Bible says the worshipper wants parch. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The worshipper make his confession once. &gt;&gt; The worshipper believe in his sacrifice once. &gt;&gt; When he believe in it once, really believe in it. Really identify himself with his sacrifice. &gt;&gt; There must be a change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We We don't have to wait for the next revival. &gt;&gt; We don't have to wait for the high priest to come to town &gt;&gt; before we feed forgiveness of our sin. We have a constant atuming. &gt;&gt; We can get down on our knees, sit behind our wheel, stay behind the soul of cocaine, make confession to God, and God will forgive us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we we we want to look at this seven spirits of God, which is the seven horn. And we know that a horn for an animal &gt;&gt; is the animal defense. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The horn is there for the animal defense is the animal protection. &gt;&gt; So here God is giving us seven spirits, seven defense which will play out in the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you are you with me tonight? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is uh I I I really I really been been uh um asking the Lord, you know, is we we can give you lot of information but uh uh uh beyond the information we really want to preach. Amen. &gt;&gt; The preaching of the gospel is different from just giving you information. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The preaching of the gospel is to bring you in contact with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the revelation of the word can strike you and you can make your own personal decision. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So let's let's stud it together now as we look at this uh these seven uh uh spirits. So we realize that this is not just a unique thing uh uh in u in the book of Revelation chapter 5. Praise the Lord. Let's go to Revelation chapter 5. Chapter 4. Revelation chapter 4. Amen. Revelation 4 verse 5, if we want to look at that quickly. And out of the throne proceed lightning and thunder and voices, and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, &gt;&gt; which are the seven spirits of God. Additional information. &gt;&gt; When you read Revelation 5, it says the horn and the eyes are the seven spirits. Now, Revelation chapter 4 here now brings up more information that the seven lampstands. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are the seven spirits. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read uh uh uh verse six. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like onto crystal. And in the midst of the throne and around about the throne were four beads full of eyes eyes uh before and behind. Now there's a reason why I reading this scripture because once again it point out eyes. Yeah, &gt;&gt; his eyes. I want us to pick up here because when we read in Revelation chapter 5, it was seven horns and seven eyes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Here in Revelation chapter 4 is telling us that the seven lampstains is the seven spirit of God. But then also it's showing us here that uh uh uh the four beasts four of eyes before and behind. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you are not if you are not grappling it just just stay with me. Just stay with me. Don't don't leave me. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you leave me I'll be alone. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 3. Now see, we came from 5 43. We are going back. We're trying to trace our step back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 3. Let's read Revelation 3:1. And unto the angel of the church of sight is right. These things say he that have the seven spirits of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation five, the seven spirits was before the throne. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 3, here the seven spirit is identified in the church ages. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now he that have the seven spirit of God and the seven stars. So now once again the seven spirit is is identified with seven stars. &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 5, it was only identified as what? Who can tell me? Let's go quickly. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5, it was identified as what? &gt;&gt; Seven. &gt;&gt; Seven horns and seven eyes. &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 4, it was identified as what? &gt;&gt; Seven lambs. &gt;&gt; Seven lamb stains. In revelation chapter three is identified as what &gt;&gt; seven stars. &gt;&gt; So we seeing the same seven spirits taking on different identification but it is the same thing. &gt;&gt; It's just like Jesus being alpha omega beginning and the end lady of the valley rose of sher is the same Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. If God help us, we'll be able to show you all of the significance of this. But for now, Revelation chapter one. Let's go to Revelation chapter one. It's Wednesday night. It's Wednesday night. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is the m Wednesday is the main day of the week. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we can be able to break the Holy Ghost down, I mean uh it will help us to go through the rest of the week until we get back on Sunday. Praise the Lord. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Revelation chapter 1, let's read verse four. John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seventh spirit which are before his throne. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this seven spirit is now identified as what? Which is which was &gt;&gt; and which is to come. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll show you show you as we go along that uh uh which was which is which is to come. Brother Brandham said is the eyes before the eyes behind. That's right. And the eyes within. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So which mean the eyes of God see things which is &gt;&gt; the eyes of God see things which was the eyes of God see things which are to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So like Paul said in Hebrew, nothing is hid from him. That's that's what I want to bring to you by looking at this that nothing is hid from him. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 4. Quickly. Hebrews chapter 4. Even if I'm not able to preach, I can I can just lay this foundation down and then it will be ringing bell in your ears for the rest in your head for the rest of the week until we get back on Sunday. Amen. Revelation 4 verse I mean Hebrew chapter 4:12 Hebrew 4:12 Now Paul this is a familiar scripture for the word of God is quick and powerful sharper than any two swore piercing even to the dividing aunder of the spirit and the soul and of the joints and the mar and and is a descender of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, &gt;&gt; the eyes of God. Nothing, nothing is hid from him. So what Paul is what Paul is doing here, he's telling you that the word of God have the eyes of God &gt;&gt; that can see in your spirit. It can see in your soul. It can see the dividing aunder. The word that is being preached to you, the word of God has the eyes of God that can be able to see. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so we see here verse 13, neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. The one that we dealing with, everything is naked in his eyes. &gt;&gt; There is no fault that can run too fast that he will not see. There is no voice that can whisper &gt;&gt; that he will not hear. &gt;&gt; Everything is naked in his eyes. &gt;&gt; The one that we are dealing with, the one with whom we have to do, you're not we're not dealing with one another as it seems like. We are all we all the preacher is dealing with the same thing. Everything of my life is naked in his eyes. Everything of your life is naked in his eyes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I can be sick sneakly to you but not to him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you likewise. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh, so I mean it's it's uh it's beautiful. I mean, you you just you squeeze some things out of me so quickly. You squeeze some things out of me so quickly. So, we we see here we see here this eyes of God. Let me give you one more and then we will find a place. I find a place to keep you until the weekend. Zechariah chapter 4. Zechariah chapter 4. We're going to see an Old Testament. So now we're going back to the Old Testament. Now we tracing our step back and uh we we so we're going back to the Old Testament here to be able to see because brother Brandon said we can pick it up in the Old Testament if we had time. Amen. He never had time, but I have time tonight so I will do it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Zechariah chapter 4. I'm in I'm in uh I'm not supposed to be supposed to be in Zechariah chapter 4. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Zechariah chapter 4. &gt;&gt; I might I might do a review on this, but I want to go quickly. Let's let's read here from verse one. Zechariah chapter 4. And the angel that talked with me came again and and and he uh talked with me came again and with me as a man that is waking out of his sleep and said unto me, what seeth them? And I said, I have looked and behold uh a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamb which are upon the top of it. Now, so here is now the angel is showing Zachchariah. He's showing Zachariah a vision here and he asking Zachariah to identify the vision. But when Zachariah identify what he's seeing, we realize it's the same thing that John saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But over there in Revelation, when John saw it, there was more meaning that came to it. Is the seven stars is the seven heart. It's the seven eyes. It's the seven horn of God. Is the seven spirits of God. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now verse three and two olive tree by it. One by the right side side of the bowl and the other by the left side. Now these two olive tree was representing the gentile and the Jews. So right here in revel in in in in Zachcharias we are seeing that God God used these seven spirit. He used the seven lampstands. He used these seven eyes all through the ages all through the gentile age when the prophets in the old testament were on a vision. It was the eye of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was operating under the seven spirits of God. Like I said, we cannot we cannot identify them in a way that we can identify it in the New Testament. The reason why we can identify it in the church ages as the first messenger, the second messenger to the seven messenger is because the Holy Ghost has come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, we could not identify it because it was a shadow. &gt;&gt; But the eye of God was still there. &gt;&gt; Here is a prophet. Yeah. Hanel is telling this king Assa that the eyes of God is running for throughout the earth. The eyes of God see that you are relying on the arm of flesh and you are not relying on the arm of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. One time the the the prophets the the the Syrian army was confused and they thought that somebody was was was uh having a reconnaissance and giving their information over to to to to Israel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the king said no I have to call this army. Somebody is betraying us because every time we make a plan Israel know where we are. Every time we make a plan when we try to hide oursel Yeah. the army of Israel catch us. I mean we subject somebody if somebody is among us they are paying them and they are the one leaking our secret. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then one of the army he he was very courageous and said no my king is not so &gt;&gt; let me tell you Israel a prophet. &gt;&gt; There's a prophet there he sees things in his bed chamber. &gt;&gt; In his bed chamber when he in his bed &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. When he in his bed, he's seeing the things we are doing. When we are on training ground, &gt;&gt; when we are developing new armor, he sees it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; They have a prophet. &gt;&gt; So, we see that from the Old Testament and and and the art of God, God has used men in types and shadow. Uh uh uh uh. Because if you look at uh uh uh uh uh David and Nathan, nobody told Nathan that David committed adultery. Nobody went and gossip. &gt;&gt; A prophet don't need gossip. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He don't entertain gossip. &gt;&gt; Nobody told Nathan. Nathan saw it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that is the eye of God. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then and and and and and what what I'm trying to bring to us tonight is to put us to that same place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To realize that uh &gt;&gt; don't you think that the eye of God is looking on your need? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He don't need God don't suffer from cataract. Amen. He don't need an eye surgery. He don't need glasses. He can see clear and bright. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he can knows the secret of our heart, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He can knows the very thought that is in our mind. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever our ways. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever our ways. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; What's about our ways? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; There's nothing There's nothing that is hid from him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is nothing that is here from him. This this this is going to get beautiful as we go as we go along. &gt;&gt; I see myself losing time. So I don't want to go ahead of myself, but I just want to hold you here tonight. It was the same art of God that show the congressman upure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was standing right there. You have to realize now uh uh uh uh uh it was it was it was uh uh uh brother Brandham pastor the same man that criticized brother Brandham and told him you don't have education. You telling me that kings were coming. You know, you were praying for kings and and all of that, you know, uh uh uh uh and wanted brother Brandham to ordain a woman preacher. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham did not agree. He he turned in his Baptist uh uh I did and and and and move on as a as as an evangelist. But do you know that brother Brandham still respected that man as his pastor? &gt;&gt; He did not agree with him but he respected him. &gt;&gt; He he realized that uh I mean he was not seeing what what he brother Brandon was seeing in the scripture. He he started to see water baptism in Jesus name. He started to see all of these things. Uh uh but he still respected the man. Many years after it will be it will be uh brother Brandon pastor that will go and get the congressman upure. &gt;&gt; Oh really? &gt;&gt; Yes. He was the one that that encouraged the congressman option to go to brother Brandon's meeting. &gt;&gt; He said Billy is my boy go he'll pray for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So so so what does that teach us? After the period of time he have come to realize that that gift in brother Brandon was genuine. &gt;&gt; At the time the gift was in its infancy. &gt;&gt; He did not believe it &gt;&gt; because he saw this boy. He can't even read the Bible. &gt;&gt; When he started preaching his his his wife or his girlfriend had to read for him before he preached. He saw him as a young man that couldn't even read the Bible. And Y say he's telling me that he's going to pray for kings. He didn't he did not believe it. But as he watched it as the years went by &gt;&gt; and what he was hearing that God was doing, &gt;&gt; he came to the place to believe that that is a gift of God. And so he encouraged a congressman to go to brother Brandham's meeting and uh uh uh congressman offshore went to the meeting and there he's there brother Brandham is preaching you know and and you know and he's you know he's preaching and and he's talking and uh you know got into the prayer line I know you know the story already I'm just only trying to show you that it was the eye of God &gt;&gt; that could have gone back in the life of congressman option &gt;&gt; saw him by vision as a young man falling from on a &gt;&gt; chariot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's how he he broke his legs and broke his back. &gt;&gt; It was not an imagination of a man. It was an eye of God. It's only the eye of God that can be definite. The eye of God don't guess. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God don't guess. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the eye of God that saw the uh uh uh uh uh in the vision that the the the young boy on the hunting trip had a checkable shirt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The art of God said it was a checkable shirt. The art of God gave the color of the checkable shirt. &gt;&gt; And here is Eddie his wife is packing his bag. She put up the shirt. He don't even even when he fell in the water and change it. He didn't even recognize that this is the shirt he was wearing. &gt;&gt; The eye of God is definite. &gt;&gt; And Paul is saying that's what we are dealing with. &gt;&gt; When we say the message of the hour, it's not a cut. &gt;&gt; It's not a politics. It's not a travel thing. It's not a national thing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We cannot sit down under the word and think that we can we can hold our indifferences. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can we can keep our struggle because our struggle is only unique to us and and we are the only one that knows it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the heart of God that says that you know he told David, he says, "You did these things in secret." The eye of God saw you. Because of that, he will expose you openly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The seven spirits of God. It's called that way because here in here in the church ages, God God has definitely uh designed the church ages with with seven church ages and seven lampstands. Uh and then he show us in the church ages how each of the age had an anointing. There was an eye that was watching over that age. But it was not only the church ages. It was right from the garden of Eden. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was right from the That's the reason why Adam could not hide when God was saying, "Adam, Adam, where are you?" Praise the Lord. The more he heard the voice of God, the more he became convinced that God knew where he was. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that's the same thing that happens to the believer. The more the believer hear the word of God, it brings conviction to them and makes them to know that God know where they are. God know what they are doing. God know what they are need of. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? [Music] I just want us to think about it tonight. Think about it tonight. I don't know how the Holy Spirit will minister to you, but you just think about it. You can look at it in every way. Not only looking at it in the area of your weaknesses, but you can look at it also in the area of your protection. because that seven eyes were seven homes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can look back there in Isaiah where God even told Israel, you know, I I keep my eyes on you and and and and and you are the apple of my eyes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the thing that that's the thing we have to deal with. That is the thing where the message of the hour have exposed us to. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is like this grandfather that was talking to his grandson and his grandson says, "Daddy, uh, granddad Do God sees me? He say, "Oh yeah, son. He love you. He can't take his eyes off you." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the message is. The message of the hour is this grandfather that is telling us that God can take his eyes off you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even in our nastiest situation, his eyes is on us. &gt;&gt; Even in our weakest moment, his eyes is on us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His eyes is on us to protect us in our weakest moment. His eyes is on us to redeem us in our fallen moment. &gt;&gt; He love you. He can take his eyes off you. Musicians, you can come tonight. We'll continue. Praise the Lord.

That's what this king, this prophet Hanad is telling this man that uh uh uh uh you cannot rely on the arm of flesh. The arm of flesh will fill you. You can't rely on your own arm of flesh. You can't rely on nobody else's arm of flesh. You have to rely on the arm of the Lord, the eye of God that is watching you. Let's stand on our feet tonight.

I we can go down this road, but I will tell you tonight that the art of God is not just to watch us for mistakes. &gt;&gt; The eye of God is our protection. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The eye of God is our protection. He He is our defense. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he brother Brandon would say it like this. He said you get in traffic and sometimes you get you you you try to get mad what is happening down what people doing. He said maybe it's God keeping you from an accident. The art of God that see things before you get there. He knows how to make situation to come up. Sometime the art of God will see things before we get there. I got to the I got to the airport and I was trying to make it home and uh uh uh we we flew down to Chicago sitting right in the tarmac for 30 meetings and my flight next flight I see it taking off and we're sitting down there. I mean all my veins boiling. I'm saying oh god I'm tired. I want to be home tonight. I don't want to sleep to the airport. And that was the last flight. I'm checking on my phone if there is if if there's another not a flight. And the Lord just spoke to my mind. What if God is keeping you from something? &gt;&gt; Why if there is something that he's keeping you from? Sometimes we think we are in control. [Music] You we you can only see as far as your nose is. We don't see what is going to happen the next moment. Sometimes we become so decisive. Sometimes we are so stubborn in a way that we we want things to be done when we can't even see the next meeting around us. [Music] So what I want us to do tonight, let's bow our heads and and just commit oursel in the hands of the Lord. I want us to come that to pray that God would just give us the consciousness that he's looking down on us. He sees what we are going through. He sees what we are going through. He sees his love in our heart. He see every effort that you are making. Every expression of love, the things that you are doing. You see that that is the reason why Paul want us not to be eye servants because we can never please the eyes of men but there is one that look down upon us. [Music] The same one that keep his eyes on the sparrow. He see that little faith in your heart. He see the little courage. [Music] He sees your tears. He sees your tears. He don't only feel your pains. He sees the pain. He knows exactly where the problem is. He knows exactly what where to touch and your body will be made whole. [Music] Oh, how we need to rely on the arm of God. How we how we need to rely how we need to just take counsel in the prophet word. Not to rely on the arm of flesh. not to rely on our own arm of flesh and our our own strength and our uh to rely on the arm of the Lord because the the eyes of God runth to and forth through the entire earth. [Music] He have already seen everything about tomorrow. Everything about tomorrow. From the time you wake up from bed, he has seen everything. He's not learning anything. [Music] His [Music] eyes are on the spell ro and I know he watches me. That's what I say. Because I'm happy. Oh yes, I can sing. Because I'm free. [Music] His eyes are on the sp. And I know he watches me. Oh yes, I sing because I'm happy. Oh, I see because I'm so glad that his eyes are on that very little sparrow and I know he watches me. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; so good. Lord God to to trust you Lord Father. Oh God I pray bring us to that consciousness especially the time that we are living in. Oh God father if we can just be conscious that his eyes watches over us. We will we will not have a reason to be afraid. If we are just will just consize our remind ourself that there is nothing that is hidden from him. All our ways are naked in the eyes of God. Our thoughts, our words, the things we say to ourself, everything is naked before the eyes of God. Father, we confess before you tonight. Oh God, we confess before you tonight. Father, we confess before you tonight, Jesus, to know that God, you so love us that you won't take your eyes off of us. God, I pray. Father, Lord, consciousize your children, Lord God. &gt;&gt; When things gets tough, Lord, when the battle gets rough, just consize us, Lord, our father, you are watching, Lord, you are looking right down on us. You are looking right down on us, oh God. If we can just only listen a little bit, you are saying it's going to be okay. You are saying I'm in control. You are saying I can heal you or I have healed you. I have delivered you. Thank you, Father, tonight. Thank you, oh God. Thank you, precious Lord. Thank you, Father. Lord, Father, when we fall, we fall right before you, oh God. When we rise up, we rise up right before you, Lord Jesus. Oh God, I pray tonight, Father. May your word bring strength to your children, oh God. May your word bring comfort, Lord. Father, may this take us to prayer, Lord God, where we can just sit before you and say, "Father, there's nothing of me you don't know. I give it all to you, Father God. We love you tonight. We love you tonight, Father God. I say because I'm happy. Oh Lord, I say because I'm free. Oh, his eyes are on the sparrow. And I know he watches me. Oh Jesus, I can say because I'm happy. Oh, I say because I am free. Oh, your eyes are all the sparrows and I thank you that you watches me. Father, you have kept your eyes upon this assembly. Word of God is going to become. Oh father, you have seen the end from the beginning. Lord Jesus, you know where we are. You know what we are dealing with, Father. You know our area of need, oh God, where we need you the most. And we know that God, you can supply it. We just thank you tonight, Father. I pray that God, you bless us as we go home, oh God. And may we meditate upon your words. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. [Music] Praise the Lord. [Music] The Lord bless you. We'll see you on Sunday. Go in the peace of the Lord. I will praise the Lord. No matter what tomorrow brings, let's just sing that chorus.

Oh, no matter what tomorrow brings, what he has in store, I know I I will praise. Oh Lord, I'm going to praise him. I'm going to serve him. I will praise the Lord. Oh, hallelujah. I will praise the Lord. [Music] [Music]
