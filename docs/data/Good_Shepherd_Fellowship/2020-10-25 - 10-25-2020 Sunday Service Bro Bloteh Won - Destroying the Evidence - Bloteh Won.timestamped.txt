[46:13] those that are streaming in
[46:15] we greet you in the name of the lord
[46:17] jesus christ in john chapter 12 we read
[46:20] from verse 1
[46:22] praise the lord amen
[46:31] then six then jesus
[46:34] praise the lord amen
[46:37] then jesus sixth day before the passover
[46:42] came to bethany yeah i said then
[46:45] six because there was something that was
[46:46] in my head so i just i was trying to say
[46:50] that and i started reading at the same
[46:52] time
[46:52] i wanted to say you know uh
[46:56] i watched that seven because it's always
[46:58] a mystery
[46:59] that's why the prophet god said in souls
[47:02] in praising
[47:04] either sixth day before or sixth day
[47:06] after
[47:08] something always happened in the
[47:09] scripture but this was six days before
[47:11] the passover came to bethany jesus came
[47:15] where lazarus was
[47:18] which have been dead whom
[47:21] he raised from the dead there they made
[47:24] him a supper
[47:26] a matter of self but lazarus
[47:30] was one of them that sat
[47:34] at the table with him
[47:37] then took mary a pound of ointment
[47:43] of sparckner
[47:46] very costly and anointed the feet of
[47:49] jesus
[47:50] and whipped his feet with her head
[47:54] and the house was filled with the order
[47:58] of the ornament then said one of his
[48:01] disciples judas oscar
[48:03] simon's son which should betray him
[48:07] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[48:11] penny pence and giving to the poor
[48:16] this he said not that he cared for the
[48:20] poor
[48:21] but because he was a thief
[48:24] and had the beg the money back the
[48:27] treasurer by the way
[48:29] and bad uh what was
[48:32] put there in then said jesus
[48:37] let her alone against
[48:40] the day of my burial have she kept this
[48:45] for the paul always he have with you
[48:49] but me ye have not always now knowing
[48:53] that he knows
[48:53] all things knowing that he even knew the
[48:57] thought
[48:57] of judas as curse but see his approach
[49:02] he never said you thief amen
[49:06] it is written here there because he was
[49:08] a thief after everything has happened
[49:11] this is john making the report but at
[49:14] that time
[49:15] jesus never dealt with that he knew what
[49:17] was going on
[49:19] amen
[49:23] verse nine most people of the jews
[49:26] therefore
[49:26] knew that he was there and
[49:30] they came not for jesus sake on it
[49:34] but that they
[49:37] might see lazarus also whom he have
[49:40] raised from the dead
[49:43] but the chief priests
[49:47] consulted that they might put lazarus
[49:52] also to death
[49:55] because that by reason
[49:58] of him many of the jews went away
[50:02] and believe on jesus amen
[50:08] having the second scripture here that's
[50:10] uh 2nd timothy chapter
[50:11] three
[50:15] second timothy chapter three and i have
[50:18] a
[50:19] i have a verse there you know

[51:32] the form of godliness
[51:34] but denying the power thereof this
[51:36] morning i want to speak on
[51:38] destroying the evidence
[51:44] destroying the evidence
[51:47] praise the lord
[51:53] destroying the evidence that's what i
[51:56] want to speak on
[51:58] this i i pick up this talk many years
[52:01] ago
[52:01] many years ago i can't remember but i
[52:04] still
[52:04] remembered i was somewhere back in
[52:06] abidjan
[52:07] went back home and i was i was listening
[52:10] to you of to a tape
[52:14] and i heard i heard i heard the prophet
[52:17] of god saying
[52:19] out there in in some of his jehovah gyra
[52:22] series
[52:23] and if you check it up you can see it
[52:25] and i have i have one year
[52:29] do i really have it
[52:35] praise the lord
[52:39] yeah i don't i don't think i pull it in
[52:41] this
[52:42] in my note but uh
[52:45] [Music]
[52:46] and what he was talking about actually
[52:48] he was talking about
[52:50] uh abraham going
[52:53] to sacrifice isaac
[52:56] after abraham has waited 25 years
[53:00] for this promised son a year god coming
[53:02] on the scene
[53:04] and asking him to go and offer
[53:07] isaac up and then
[53:10] he's dramatizing it and he's saying and
[53:12] satan is speaking to
[53:14] abraham and mine and saying do you mean
[53:17] that you are going to destroy the
[53:19] evidence
[53:21] so that thought caught my mind for as
[53:24] many as long time ago
[53:26] and and and but i was what i was trying
[53:30] to
[53:31] struggling in my mind i'm trying to
[53:33] reconcile
[53:35] destroying the evidence you know
[53:38] uh uh what what
[53:41] what a benefit it can be that's i've
[53:43] struggled with that in my mind many
[53:45] years
[53:45] many years ago and it comes back to me
[53:48] and i think about it it comes back to me
[53:50] and recently i started thinking about it
[53:52] again
[53:53] as i was i was looking at something else
[53:55] the talk came back to me and destroying
[53:57] the evidence
[53:59] so uh uh you know i started studying but
[54:02] i compare this with uh
[54:06] [Music]
[54:07] lazarus situation year
[54:10] amen the bible says the chief priests
[54:14] they consulted they plotted
[54:17] to get rid of lazarus to put him back to
[54:19] death
[54:20] because he wasn't evidence
[54:24] [Music]
[54:26] so we're talking about destroying the
[54:29] evidence
[54:30] of the resurrection if you can take it
[54:32] from the church
[54:34] you can bring everything of the word in
[54:36] the church the only thing that is
[54:39] stopping
[54:40] a flood gate of sin and word from the
[54:43] church
[54:44] is the evidence of the resurrection that
[54:47] is dwelling in the hearts of the
[54:49] believer
[54:50] because satan can stand dead
[54:54] so everything every pressure that he's
[54:57] putting on the believer
[54:58] is to destroy the evidence
[55:04] praise the lord is to destroy the
[55:06] evidence whenever
[55:07] there is a coup case or there is a crime
[55:10] and things happen that is the first
[55:14] thing people
[55:14] try to look for to try to erase the
[55:16] evidence
[55:18] because if they can get rid of the
[55:20] evidence then there is no case
[55:23] but i'm telling you it's hard to destroy
[55:26] evidence
[55:28] amen it's hard to destroy
[55:32] evidence
[55:36] oh my goodness put on your seatbelt this
[55:39] morning
[55:43] hey man you can't stop
[55:46] evidence that's why we have
[55:50] a forensic theme and people have been
[55:52] taught how to go in
[55:54] and you know and and they can go into a
[55:57] crown spot and
[55:58] they can look around and look around and
[56:00] they will be looking around and
[56:02] and i mean if they see a shoes
[56:06] on the kitchen table is that is not a
[56:09] normal place for her shoes to be
[56:11] so as shoes being on the kitchen table
[56:15] know grab that grab the attention
[56:19] of the the
[56:22] you know grab the attention of the
[56:25] the investigators praise the lord
[56:29] and then the the the starts to look into
[56:31] it
[56:33] so i mean and all of that praise the
[56:36] lord
[56:37] so uh
[56:42] i heard sister evie back there
[56:44] [Laughter]
[56:47] she's always working with evidence in
[56:49] the cold so i think
[56:51] is catching her attention this morning i
[56:53] have to be careful now
[56:58] praise the lord
[57:01] i don't work in the cult system so i
[57:03] have to be careful how i use my language
[57:09] praise the lord amen
[57:12] it's just a wonderful thing to be a a
[57:14] child of god amen
[57:17] praise the lord and and we just love the
[57:19] lord for that
[57:21] amen but we want to talk about
[57:23] destroying the evidence
[57:26] it's something that is difficult to do
[57:29] and you know i i said thought about it
[57:32] you know sometimes the lord gave you a
[57:34] thought
[57:35] and and it can go for years and years
[57:37] and years
[57:38] waiting for the appointed time and just
[57:41] at the point of time he can give you the
[57:43] right material
[57:44] and give you the right thoughts amen
[57:48] but when we look back to our scripture
[57:50] year
[57:51] the bible makes us to know
[57:55] sixth day before the passover
[57:58] and we have to realize that jesus was
[58:01] the truth pass over lamb
[58:04] amen he was the truth passover lamb
[58:09] and uh and years said
[58:13] he went down over to uh
[58:17] to visit with his friend lazarus
[58:20] and when he got in the synod you just
[58:22] read the chapter back that was where
[58:24] lazarus was resurrected and we know all
[58:27] of the things that have happened you
[58:28] know mary
[58:29] mattered the same for jesus and he was
[58:31] not coming you know the council
[58:34] came he says you you see that's what
[58:36] happened you left the church you'll
[58:38] follow that man
[58:39] and uh you know and now the priests can
[58:41] come and counsel your
[58:43] weary seat and we know all the other
[58:45] things that you know people nature has
[58:46] not changed amen
[58:48] man is stay the same praise the lord and
[58:51] but we see that but we know what
[58:54] happened when jesus came praise the lord
[58:56] he said lazarus comfort and the grave
[58:59] could not hold him praise the lord
[59:01] amen the grave could not hold him a man
[59:04] been dead four days
[59:08] he resurrected amen and and
[59:11] and jesus jesus allowed
[59:15] for corruption to set in his body
[59:21] when it went over 72 hours and
[59:24] corruption
[59:25] has already set in his body
[59:28] praise the lord and i believe one of the
[59:30] reasons
[59:31] it will bring us back to what paul said
[59:33] in the book of uh
[59:35] timothy that immortality
[59:38] dwells with us
[59:43] praise the lord so we might be sick with
[59:45] this uh
[59:46] problem and sick you having many of
[59:48] god's children that are still fighting
[59:50] cancers and different things
[59:51] but yet in that body immortality
[59:56] does in their soul amen
[1:00:00] the bottom is struggle with pains and
[1:00:02] different things but there is life
[1:00:04] that dwarf india saw is now when we
[1:00:07] cross over before we get eternal life
[1:00:09] we get a full test of a year in this
[1:00:12] body
[1:00:13] oh that's the thing that keeps us with
[1:00:15] joy that's the thing that keeps us
[1:00:17] praising god
[1:00:19] you know for the believer saving jesus
[1:00:22] is not a means many people
[1:00:26] take christianity as a means to be happy
[1:00:31] christianity is not a means christianity
[1:00:34] is the end
[1:00:39] praise the lord amen
[1:00:42] oh people i mean uh they want to serve
[1:00:45] god
[1:00:45] because they want to get a good job they
[1:00:47] want to serve god because they believe
[1:00:49] that
[1:00:49] you know at the end of the day they're
[1:00:52] going to have a happy life they got to
[1:00:53] get a good wife they got to go to good
[1:00:55] marriage you gotta get
[1:00:56] you know uh uh you know uh and and all
[1:00:59] of that
[1:01:01] christianity is not a means
[1:01:09] praise the lord
[1:01:13] that's not what i'm going anyway but
[1:01:15] yeah so we see
[1:01:16] here that
[1:01:20] lazarus it's a life
[1:01:25] and evidence now you have to know
[1:01:28] that was the subject of discuss
[1:01:32] in the sahebrance council
[1:01:36] because the pharisees believed the
[1:01:38] resurrection
[1:01:39] the sadducees don't believe the
[1:01:41] resurrection
[1:01:43] but yet in the sanhedrin's council they
[1:01:46] could
[1:01:46] put their doctrine aside and agree
[1:01:49] when it comes to council meeting let's
[1:01:51] not talk about resurrection before we
[1:01:52] support this meeting
[1:01:53] you'll leave that subject
[1:01:56] they can agree the scientists uh
[1:01:59] the the uh scientist council the
[1:02:02] pharisees
[1:02:03] you know sadducees herodians and ered or
[1:02:06] zadok and all of the different groups
[1:02:07] that were there they had their petty
[1:02:10] difference and petty
[1:02:11] in doctrines and that is the same thing
[1:02:13] they do in the word council of churches
[1:02:15] but so but we we see here
[1:02:18] that jesus in his teaching started
[1:02:23] preaching about he that believed in me
[1:02:25] will not die and you know he started
[1:02:27] saying all of these things
[1:02:28] and this was the thing that was causing
[1:02:31] problems this kind of a teaching
[1:02:33] because they were not heard in you know
[1:02:35] in those different groups that were
[1:02:36] there
[1:02:38] praise the lord you remember one time
[1:02:42] the
[1:02:43] the the sahindrans wanted to i mean the
[1:02:46] uh the sadducees wanted wanted to attack
[1:02:49] him
[1:02:50] and he brought the story of this man
[1:02:52] that married his wife he died
[1:02:53] calling to the lord his his his brother
[1:02:55] should marry her
[1:02:56] and the brother died calling to the lord
[1:02:58] the other brother and there were seven
[1:03:00] brothers and she never had a child now
[1:03:02] in the resurrection whose wife she's
[1:03:04] going to be
[1:03:05] because they wanted to prove that there
[1:03:07] is no resurrection
[1:03:09] amen now as jesus talked about the
[1:03:12] subject of the resurrection
[1:03:14] he was not going to allow them to go to
[1:03:17] the grave and go to the other side
[1:03:19] lazarus would be resurrected right in
[1:03:21] the city
[1:03:22] this would not be when we die this would
[1:03:25] be when we are all alive
[1:03:32] praise the lord they were talking when
[1:03:34] when when you know when the
[1:03:35] in in the resurrection who wife they
[1:03:37] would be
[1:03:39] praise the lord
[1:03:43] jesus said let not wait for that time
[1:03:44] let's do it right now
[1:03:47] amen the holy ghost is not for the
[1:03:50] rapture it's not for
[1:03:51] the millennium the holy ghost is for
[1:03:53] right now
[1:03:54] is for right now it's for today it's for
[1:03:58] the challenges of today
[1:04:00] it's for the hour that we are living in
[1:04:05] praise the lord oh when we get to heaven
[1:04:07] we're going to be
[1:04:08] happy we're going to praise the lord
[1:04:10] that prison right now
[1:04:12] we can praise him right now
[1:04:15] oh because heaven is on earth
[1:04:19] heaven is in our soul
[1:04:26] praise the lord destroying the evidence
[1:04:33] glory be to god
[1:04:38] whenever there is a plane crash they
[1:04:41] always want the black box
[1:04:44] because if they can get the black box
[1:04:47] they can be able to have some evidence
[1:04:50] what actually went wrong praise the lord
[1:04:56] amen oh may the lord help us this

[1:07:47] what goes with wanting a miracle
[1:07:50] amen so uh but on the other side
[1:07:55] we have this council of the chief
[1:07:58] priests
[1:08:01] the hindrance council discussing on this
[1:08:03] side
[1:08:05] we have to put an end to it
[1:08:09] we have to put an end to it
[1:08:13] these are religious people these
[1:08:16] are the people that we will call our
[1:08:18] bishops and act bishops
[1:08:26] discussing to put an
[1:08:29] end to something that
[1:08:32] not not what a man has done
[1:08:36] so something that the very god they
[1:08:39] claim to self
[1:08:44] they wear their big robs they stand on
[1:08:47] their high
[1:08:47] platform pages and they talk about god
[1:08:51] but the very god that they claim to self
[1:08:54] has raised a man from the dead
[1:09:00] praise the lord and they are discussing
[1:09:05] plotting and planning how to kill him
[1:09:10] all because he's on evidence
[1:09:18] praise the lord all because
[1:09:21] he's an evidence
[1:09:25] but it's hard to stop an evidence
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:32] lazarus was a gentleman there was no
[1:09:36] crime
[1:09:36] it's never regarded of what crime he has
[1:09:38] done
[1:09:41] the only crime that lazarus did was he
[1:09:44] was on evidence
[1:09:47] his crime was his life
[1:09:50] was a rebuke to a religious system
[1:09:56] and that's what the church the the
[1:09:59] council of churches will come
[1:10:01] after you that's the reason why they
[1:10:05] will come after
[1:10:05] you is because
[1:10:09] your life is an evidence
[1:10:18] praise the lord amen
[1:10:24] look this is serious business all of
[1:10:27] these things that is happening
[1:10:28] the lord is just preparing us for for
[1:10:31] our time
[1:10:37] there is coming on another to this world
[1:10:40] where the uh uh uh politics and and
[1:10:44] and and religion is going to join
[1:10:46] together
[1:10:48] they're going to blend together they're
[1:10:50] going to agree
[1:10:53] and they're going to compare every
[1:10:57] claiming church to fall under that
[1:10:59] belief system
[1:11:04] it's coming people
[1:11:09] praise the lord that was the only crime
[1:11:12] that lazarus committed
[1:11:14] because his life he
[1:11:18] being alive his choice
[1:11:21] of leaving the synagogues
[1:11:25] and following jesus that then they had a
[1:11:27] church
[1:11:28] they were meeting either on on the
[1:11:29] mountain or they would meet uh
[1:11:31] on the sea where he would use a boat to
[1:11:33] preach you know
[1:11:34] or they'll meet on a tree they have out
[1:11:36] of this house fellowship
[1:11:38] for him to leave that big uh
[1:11:41] uh uh uh a temple that was built by
[1:11:43] solomon
[1:11:44] and and you know and and where people
[1:11:46] had their family records for
[1:11:48] generation and generation and generation
[1:11:51] they left the system and they choose to
[1:11:55] follow
[1:11:56] the message of their day they choose to
[1:11:59] follow
[1:11:59] the messenger of the hour
[1:12:08] the lord and hear it said
[1:12:11] the alive now becoming
[1:12:14] a rebuke
[1:12:17] a rebuke to a corrupt system
[1:12:23] that is the way your life is young
[1:12:25] people
[1:12:26] when you choose to stand by god's word
[1:12:30] amen it's a rebuke
[1:12:34] you must be proud of it and don't be
[1:12:37] ashamed
[1:12:40] for paul says i'm not ashamed of the
[1:12:41] gospel of jesus christ
[1:12:43] for is the power of god unto salvation
[1:12:47] amen or you might think you you're going
[1:12:51] through
[1:12:51] your little battle out of all of these
[1:12:54] things but on the other hand
[1:12:56] your life is a rebuke
[1:12:59] to this filthy and corrupt generation
[1:13:03] a generation that is just full of
[1:13:06] filth
[1:13:10] amen god
[1:13:13] is raising you up he's possessing your
[1:13:17] being
[1:13:19] he's dealing with your heart for you
[1:13:23] to be a rebuke
[1:13:28] when young people are leading in singing
[1:13:31] and
[1:13:32] uh uh sex is the order of the dating
[1:13:36] and drugs is the order of the day
[1:13:39] but yet god have people
[1:13:42] in every generation oh we have a people
[1:13:47] for his namesake let them call you
[1:13:50] whatever they think they want to call
[1:13:52] you
[1:13:54] praise the lord that was lazarus only
[1:13:57] crime
[1:13:59] it's because he was on evidence
[1:14:03] praise the lord and one thing that
[1:14:05] people don't like
[1:14:07] people don't like to be reminded
[1:14:11] i mean people don't like to be reminded
[1:14:20] that's why we try to destroy evidence
[1:14:26] because as long as an
[1:14:30] evidence see that's why all of these
[1:14:33] people that work on crime evidence they
[1:14:36] are able to
[1:14:36] build an evidence to be able to bring
[1:14:40] you back
[1:14:41] to the scene
[1:14:44] they will bring you back to the scene
[1:14:49] and people are afraid of that
[1:14:52] to come back to the scene but a believer
[1:14:55] is not afraid of to come back to the
[1:14:57] scene

[1:15:01] get ahead of myself praise the lord
[1:15:05] oh i don't want to get it get ahead of
[1:15:07] myself amen

[1:15:11] church they are denying the power
[1:15:13] thereof
[1:15:15] just having the form of godliness
[1:15:19] they can belong to a church put their
[1:15:21] name on the church bulk they don't care
[1:15:23] how they run their
[1:15:24] life get a little church or drinks and
[1:15:26] and you know and just fly loose
[1:15:30] and stay they can hold to their
[1:15:31] profession

[1:16:34] when the year jerusalem on the news
[1:16:37] because it plays back to their mind
[1:16:40] that they were not able to wipe out the
[1:16:42] evidence
[1:16:46] when he heard about jews and he heard
[1:16:48] about jerusalem it brings your mind back
[1:16:54] because hitler was planning to whip
[1:16:57] the jews out of the earth
[1:17:08] glory be to god
[1:17:12] amen my my my mind
[1:17:17] destroying the evidence
[1:17:21] glory be to god
[1:17:24] david said in sin that my mother
[1:17:27] conceived me
[1:17:30] i came to the world speaking lies
[1:17:34] praise the lord that was an evidence
[1:17:37] that in sin my mother conceived me
[1:17:40] because i came to the word
[1:17:42] speaking lies i never went to school to
[1:17:44] learn how to lie

[1:18:50] he tried to hide the evidence
[1:18:56] oh my goodness me praise the lord

[1:19:03] what a time that we are living in that's

[1:24:17] amen fear is a demon it's not just a
[1:24:20] thought
[1:24:21] it's a spirit it's a devil
[1:24:30] praise the lord but as the story goes on

[1:24:57] it was up to about six seven eight nine
[1:24:59] in the night she would stay there with

[1:25:04] driving she
[1:25:05] i mean said he said just pull over
[1:25:10] and she said to her surprise she didn't
[1:25:12] know what happened
[1:25:14] you know as soon as she pulled the car
[1:25:16] over he raised his hand
[1:25:18] up and said lord jesus forgive me for
[1:25:21] all i've had done
[1:25:24] took his gun empty all the bullet in her
[1:25:26] purse
[1:25:30] and everything as the story goes on and
[1:25:33] uh
[1:25:35] and finally he told her take me to the
[1:25:38] bus station
[1:25:40] she took him bought a bus ticket
[1:25:43] give give him the book that she was
[1:25:46] reading
[1:25:51] and the bible
[1:25:54] and she went home at that time her
[1:25:57] husband freaking out
[1:25:59] she said when she got home police have
[1:26:01] surrounded her house
[1:26:05] and when she got out she started smiling
[1:26:08] her husband got so angry where have you
[1:26:11] been
[1:26:12] where have you been we've been looking
[1:26:13] for you you are laughing and at this
[1:26:16] and she told him that she was
[1:26:20] wave
[1:26:23] the man that had been hunting the time
[1:26:25] down she said his knees
[1:26:26] knock he fell to the ground
[1:26:32] he fell to the ground so being afraid
[1:26:36] and that's how the police interrogated
[1:26:38] her and everything finally she had to
[1:26:39] tell them where he was
[1:26:41] to the bus station they went there
[1:26:44] they saw this young man as calm sitting
[1:26:47] down reading the book
[1:26:49] that the lady gave him
[1:26:53] he turned himself in gave his gun give
[1:26:56] all his knives
[1:26:57] and told the detective the story
[1:27:01] he says it would have been the bloody
[1:27:03] fight here today
[1:27:06] it is because of that young woman i give
[1:27:09] my heart to the lord jesus
[1:27:10] there is no evil in my heart
[1:27:14] and that's how he want to praise him the
[1:27:16] end of the story
[1:27:17] i mean they gave him the death penalty
[1:27:20] but just before the death penalty he he
[1:27:24] he said a prayer that was typed out you
[1:27:26] know how he prayed to the lord jesus and
[1:27:28] you know committing himself he said
[1:27:30] father i'm coming home
[1:27:31] i just played the story of the thief on
[1:27:33] the cross
[1:27:35] but the the praising god testified
[1:27:40] that he became a christian because of
[1:27:42] that young man
[1:27:44] and many inmates gave themselves to the
[1:27:47] lord jesus
[1:27:48] why because of a young woman
[1:27:51] that was possessed by the holy ghost a
[1:27:55] young woman
[1:27:58] that decided not to be terrified by the
[1:28:01] devil

[1:28:40] afraid that she couldn't go
[1:28:42] to the prison she said i couldn't
[1:28:43] understand
[1:28:45] but i just believe that at that time
[1:28:49] in the vehicle the presence of god was
[1:28:51] just like a bubble
[1:28:52] around me amen
[1:28:56] praise the lord and that's just how it

[1:30:00] from the
[1:30:01] unfailing realities of the living god
[1:30:04] and that's what
[1:30:05] pentecost is doing today they want to
[1:30:09] make
[1:30:09] intellectual giants they want to take
[1:30:13] the power of
[1:30:14] the power out of the church
[1:30:17] that's what they want to do just bring
[1:30:19] us intellectual giants
[1:30:22] people that would just use words

[1:30:26] terminology they play on the minds of
[1:30:29] the people
[1:30:29] bring laughter in the church people to
[1:30:32] make jokes

[1:31:08] bringing
[1:31:09] more members in that's nonsense
[1:31:14] and when you buy the man to a creed
[1:31:17] when you do that you take the holy
[1:31:20] spirit away from him

[1:32:24] from on high
[1:32:27] how did the power come now that joining
[1:32:29] church he said i challenge you to do it
[1:32:31] see by joining church shake the hand of
[1:32:33] the preacher
[1:32:34] how did it come power from on high this
[1:32:37] is when they assembled together
[1:32:40] in one accord
[1:32:43] and god empower his people
[1:32:46] that's what the holy ghost is for
[1:32:50] is to empower you to make you to stand

[1:33:03] believe that this the church still has
[1:33:06] a power god has never taken his power
[1:33:10] from the church but the church don't
[1:33:14] have
[1:33:14] faith enough to act upon it
[1:33:21] amen the power is there
[1:33:27] praise the lord
[1:33:38] the church don't have faith enough to
[1:33:40] add upon it that's all
[1:33:42] it just it's just that simple we try to
[1:33:46] make it so complicated sometimes
[1:33:48] but but the more
[1:33:52] simple you make the gospel the more
[1:33:56] real you will have it when you just get
[1:34:00] real simple with it god said it that set
[1:34:03] to it
[1:34:04] and that's all and just believe it and
[1:34:07] go ahead
[1:34:10] that's the human mind we always try to
[1:34:13] come
[1:34:13] you know make it complicated by
[1:34:15] reasoning how we it happen
[1:34:19] amen if we were just think about
[1:34:22] who said it then how will it happen
[1:34:27] things will be much better for us
[1:34:31] who said it god said it if god said it
[1:34:34] god is able to back it up
[1:34:42] praise the lord
[1:34:49] oh my god hallelujah
[1:34:54] so let's get to the story
[1:34:59] we see god gave abraham a promise 25
[1:35:03] years
[1:35:04] he waited for it and year he said god is
[1:35:07] saying
[1:35:08] abraham if you love me
[1:35:12] then you have to give me your son you
[1:35:14] have to sacrifice him to me
[1:35:16] praise the lord amen
[1:35:21] abraham told his wife took his seventh
[1:35:24] the wing
[1:35:25] left them down on the mountain took his
[1:35:27] little boy up the hill
[1:35:29] you think about it praise the lord
[1:35:34] yes god has given him a promise and here
[1:35:37] is god
[1:35:39] going to destroy the evidence
[1:35:42] that this man has waited for him 25
[1:35:46] years
[1:35:47] and only god can destroy evidence
[1:35:52] because when god destroyed an evidence
[1:35:54] he wrote it back
[1:35:56] to the original
[1:36:03] when men destroyed evidence they used
[1:36:05] clorox they tried to change the color
[1:36:07] they tried to whip it up they tried to
[1:36:10] hide it they tried to do
[1:36:11] everything but the evidence is still
[1:36:13] there
[1:36:17] but when god destroyed an evidence
[1:36:22] he wrote it back to the original
[1:36:26] so he told abraham oh when the lord
[1:36:28] helped me to understand this
[1:36:30] i was just having a shouting fight amen
[1:36:33] i said god you are so good praise the
[1:36:36] lord
[1:36:37] he told abraham take your son up there
[1:36:39] and and you sacrificed
[1:36:40] him to me now you have to remember that
[1:36:43] every sacrificial
[1:36:45] in the bible from adam that the lamb
[1:36:47] that god slayed
[1:36:48] to cover adam a a a a sin in the garden
[1:36:52] of eden
[1:36:53] all of that represented christ
[1:36:58] because that was the lamb of god that
[1:37:00] was flamed from the foundation of the
[1:37:02] word
[1:37:03] in god's mind
[1:37:06] so when god told abraham to prove his
[1:37:10] love to him god was not just so
[1:37:13] cruel over the son of of of of abraham
[1:37:17] god was thinking about what he had in
[1:37:19] his mind
[1:37:22] praise the lord abraham and his son got
[1:37:25] up there
[1:37:26] and and he built the altar that he and
[1:37:29] little isaac so excited for his first
[1:37:32] sacrifice
[1:37:33] running around picking up the wood and
[1:37:35] his fat oh daddy i would do it and he
[1:37:37] built the altar
[1:37:38] put the wood together and everything how
[1:37:41] does it look papa
[1:37:42] it looked good
[1:37:46] but where is the lamb where is the
[1:37:49] sacrifice
[1:37:52] praise the lord he says son
[1:37:56] god will provide himself a sacrifice
[1:38:02] that was what abraham said he said god
[1:38:05] will provide himself
[1:38:11] praise the lord
[1:38:16] even though god told him to do that
[1:38:20] praise the lord now you see that the
[1:38:22] thing about it there is that
[1:38:24] this is one of the things that the
[1:38:26] church through the ages has suffered
[1:38:28] from
[1:38:30] praise the lord this uh this
[1:38:34] uh uh uh a kind of a a
[1:38:37] humanistic gospel where
[1:38:41] man is so much in the picture
[1:38:44] people tell you what they have done for
[1:38:46] the lord
[1:38:50] they want to talk about what they have
[1:38:52] done for the lord
[1:38:54] you can do nothing for god
[1:38:58] you can't even suffer from for god
[1:39:03] when you suffer you are partaking
[1:39:06] of his suffering it is his suffering
[1:39:10] that you are partaking on
[1:39:15] amen
[1:39:19] god will provide himself
[1:39:23] a sacrifice that's what
[1:39:26] that's that was the answer that abraham
[1:39:28] told his son
[1:39:31] and every time isaac comes and says papa
[1:39:34] where is the sacrifice
[1:39:37] isaac god will provide himself a
[1:39:40] sacrifice
[1:39:42] amen now so what god will do
[1:39:47] he will roll back
[1:39:51] amen he will roll back to the original
[1:39:54] sacrifice
[1:39:57] by providing a ram in the ticket
[1:40:03] because what abraham was going to do
[1:40:06] was representing the lamb of god that
[1:40:09] was flamed from the foundation of the
[1:40:11] world
[1:40:16] and he's the only one that can destroy
[1:40:22] the evidence praise the lord
[1:40:26] oh my goodness only him can destroy
[1:40:30] the evidence
[1:40:34] because what he does is that he take our
[1:40:37] sin
[1:40:38] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:40:41] he wrote it back and justify you and say
[1:40:45] you have
[1:40:45] never done it in the first place praise
[1:40:48] the lord
[1:40:50] amen it's just not a lived confession
[1:40:53] but i mean he deeds with your life he
[1:40:55] changed your life so much
[1:40:57] that the things that you used to cry for
[1:40:59] the things that used to rule your life
[1:41:02] have no longer power over you
[1:41:06] he break the drug's habit the sex habit
[1:41:09] the lying habits
[1:41:16] even if you try high you'll never be
[1:41:18] able to find your way back
[1:41:22] that's how he destroyed the evidence
[1:41:24] only god
[1:41:28] can destroy the evidence
[1:41:32] praise the lord that was what he did for
[1:41:35] adam
[1:41:37] amen he provided
[1:41:41] alarm
[1:41:45] and you know what he did covered covered
[1:41:48] them in the lime skin
[1:41:49] in the bleeding skin that when adam and
[1:41:53] eve was growing
[1:41:54] out of the garden of eden it was not
[1:41:57] it was not human blood that was dropping
[1:42:00] but it was a lime blood
[1:42:03] speaking about the lamb of god
[1:42:09] god covered up the evidence by rolling
[1:42:12] it back to the original
[1:42:15] the original sacrifice
[1:42:18] praise the lord he sent
[1:42:22] joshua and his men out there to jericho
[1:42:26] he says bring thou we could set it down
[1:42:34] amen go and bring down city down
[1:42:38] go inspire the land then there is a
[1:42:42] woman
[1:42:43] a rehab that has such
[1:42:46] an ugly reputation she was an infant
[1:42:50] woman she was a prostitute
[1:42:53] but she saw this mess she saw these men
[1:42:57] at first she approached them she thought
[1:42:59] they were strangers
[1:43:01] they might need a place to sleep
[1:43:04] because that was the weight of her life
[1:43:06] she knew this man that came in the city
[1:43:07] and went out
[1:43:09] praise the lord we know the story about
[1:43:13] it
[1:43:15] how the word of jericho came down
[1:43:18] but later did
[1:43:22] rahab knew that when that war came down
[1:43:27] all the evidence of her past life
[1:43:32] came down with the wall
[1:43:36] all the evidence of her past life
[1:43:40] the past men that she slept with came
[1:43:42] down
[1:43:43] the past house said she slept and came
[1:43:45] down
[1:43:47] and god wept the evidence away
[1:43:53] only god
[1:43:57] can destroy the evidence and that's what
[1:44:02] the promise of the holy ghost is
[1:44:06] that's what the promise of the holy
[1:44:08] ghost is
[1:44:09] to the church
[1:44:18] is to destroy the evidence of sin
[1:44:24] change our lives paul says
[1:44:29] because we believe in grace should we
[1:44:30] continue in sin
[1:44:32] say god forbid
[1:44:36] god forbid
[1:44:39] now what is the purpose of his death
[1:44:44] and we must just be hanging around in
[1:44:46] every scene and just
[1:44:48] we are on a grace we are not on what is
[1:44:50] the purpose of his death
[1:44:55] now you have to remember you cannot
[1:44:58] destroy the evidence
[1:45:01] you might try and every try that you you
[1:45:04] try
[1:45:05] you will just be using makeup
[1:45:09] that's why people use makeup for to this
[1:45:11] do to cover up the evidence
[1:45:17] every try you try you will just be using
[1:45:20] makeup it will not take away the
[1:45:22] evidence
[1:45:22] the only thing that takes away the
[1:45:24] evidence is the blood of jesus christ
[1:45:27] is the lamb of god
[1:45:33] you join this church you're just using
[1:45:36] makeup
[1:45:37] you run to this other church you're just
[1:45:39] using makeup you do this church screen
[1:45:42] you're just using makeup
[1:45:46] [Music]
[1:45:53] but there is one makeup you can use
[1:46:01] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:46:04] the lord jesus christ
[1:46:05] and you shall receive the holy ghost
[1:46:08] power from on higher
[1:46:12] and whip away the evidence
[1:46:20] oh my goodness oh praise the lord

[1:46:58] is nothing against you
[1:47:01] do you feed it that your evidence has
[1:47:02] been destroyed

[1:48:01] that guy to keep talking
[1:48:03] he even stopped at a gas station and
[1:48:05] asked her to go and buy the papers

[1:52:53] one of the believers and we were talking

[1:53:04] about you know did you went
[1:53:07] to the store to buy
[1:53:10] and and i think the lord just gave us a
[1:53:12] breaking point there because
[1:53:14] it came so real some of the things that
[1:53:16] we struggle with
[1:53:17] is it it's genetically
[1:53:21] you know but the devil has a way of
[1:53:24] making a
[1:53:25] u but you have to realize

[1:53:38] amen and honor the praising system
[1:53:42] the way to make you to lost your
[1:53:45] identity

[1:53:53] you by number
[1:53:56] amen and age
[1:53:59] is just a number
[1:54:02] oh i'm getting all all i get is just a
[1:54:06] number
[1:54:17] young that's the reason why when the war
[1:54:20] comes
[1:54:20] you can jump up you can say hallelujah
[1:54:23] that is that
[1:54:24] that is the expression of the rear you
[1:54:28] don't let the devil put a number on you
[1:54:31] and come and tell me you're getting old
[1:54:33] i don't want to hear that
[1:54:38] i was sitting in the office dead and uh
[1:54:40] and uh yeah uh
[1:54:42] you know brother hillary leading never

[1:54:47] a finium never grow old should be a song
[1:54:49] a believer should be
[1:54:50] never grow oh you must express it
[1:54:54] [Applause]
[1:54:59] you must be able to express it because
[1:55:01] it's a confession
[1:55:02] it's a reality
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:13] don't sing it like we're standing over a
[1:55:16] grave
[1:55:26] amen it's just a number
[1:55:33] that's the devil prison system he put a
[1:55:36] number on you
[1:55:39] amen no matter what your age is
[1:55:43] there he said there was a 18 year old
[1:55:45] behind our body
[1:55:48] glory be to god amen
[1:55:52] i'm telling you we have an emergency
[1:55:55] right now you see how all of these
[1:55:57] bodies will be
[1:55:58] flipping through that door just like
[1:56:06] but you don't have to wait for an
[1:56:08] emergency to express your youthfulness
[1:56:10] you don't have to you have to express it
[1:56:13] every day
[1:56:14] every moment let the devil knows that's
[1:56:17] a
[1:56:18] young vibrant person living in his body
[1:56:20] [Applause]
[1:56:23] glory to god amen whoo
[1:56:32] but bram says that's the reason you were
[1:56:33] born
[1:56:35] you know he says uh you were a sinner to
[1:56:38] begin with that's right
[1:56:41] you was deceived into it we were born in
[1:56:44] sin
[1:56:45] amen even before committing no sin we
[1:56:48] were born in sin
[1:56:52] that is by the sin of our our parents
[1:56:56] adam and eve
[1:57:01] but you can be able to change the course
[1:57:05] you can be able to cut yourself from
[1:57:08] that same line
[1:57:10] because there is a provision through the
[1:57:12] cross of jesus christ
[1:57:17] there is no need of making poor excuse
[1:57:21] i'm just a sinner saved by grace yes
[1:57:22] that's the reason why jesus died
[1:57:24] so you will not stay as sinners saved by
[1:57:26] grace
[1:57:29] you will be a sinner redeemed amen
[1:57:32] and now a son and daughter of god
[1:57:36] he says this is my message to the church
[1:57:38] now
[1:57:39] you are standing if you are standing in
[1:57:42] god's word amen
[1:57:45] and with god's word every amen
[1:57:48] every jug every title where you are
[1:57:51] standing i'm trying to tell you
[1:57:54] pull away from the shark and get into
[1:57:57] the wheat where you can get
[1:57:59] wrapped before the sun
[1:58:02] i heard the coming of the combined
[1:58:06] he says you are standing complete
[1:58:08] justify
[1:58:10] like you never did it in the first place
[1:58:14] amen
[1:58:17] that's the thing that destroyed the
[1:58:19] evidence
[1:58:20] amen and that was the thing that the
[1:58:22] pharisees were trying to kill
[1:58:25] lazarus for instead of rejoicing
[1:58:28] that the god of abraham is in our midst
[1:58:33] they're trying to kill him because he
[1:58:36] came back to life
[1:58:38] he came back to life
[1:58:44] god allowed it that it was not just a
[1:58:48] family matter of mary and martyr
[1:58:51] they took him to the grave they opened
[1:58:53] the tomb
[1:58:54] they put him there they put a stone
[1:58:57] that's why when jesus came
[1:58:59] back to bethlehem the whole town came
[1:59:02] when he told mary
[1:59:04] i am the resurrection
[1:59:07] and the life where you laid him
[1:59:11] praise the lord the bible says the whole
[1:59:14] town came to see what he was going
[1:59:16] to do he stood right there
[1:59:19] he left his head to heaven and he wept
[1:59:24] but he wept like a man
