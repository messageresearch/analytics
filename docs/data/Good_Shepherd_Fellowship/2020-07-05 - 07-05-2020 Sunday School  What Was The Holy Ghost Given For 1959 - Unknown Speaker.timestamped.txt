[0:01] [Music]
[0:21] beyond Pentecost Pentecost has settled
[0:26] itself into organizations and started
[0:29] thinking whole lot about organizations
[0:32] we are this and we're that that's just
[0:35] nature you just can't help it
[0:39] its nature they'll do that it's the plan
[0:42] for them to do that but the church has
[0:45] moved on it's gone into greater more
[0:49] powerful it's a restoration of gifts in
[0:52] many Pentecostal people does not believe
[0:55] in divine healing ministry of angels and
[0:58] powers of God many Pentecostals calls
[1:02] these visions that are see the devil
[1:04] many organizations won't even have
[1:06] nothing to do with it in Pentecost see
[1:08] we've moved beyond that just as
[1:11] Methodists called Pentecostal crazy for
[1:14] speaking in tongues just as Lutheran
[1:17] called Methodist crazy for shouting see
[1:20] but it's all a coming forth out of the
[1:23] holy spirit to all the great churches
[1:26] being filled up and chugged full of the
[1:32] great powers of Almighty God until it's
[1:36] got to a place until the very works that
[1:39] Jesus done is manifesting itself right
[1:41] in the church now we're close friends
[1:46] let me stop here just for a minute to
[1:48] get what God put the Holy Ghost in the
[1:51] church for give you another time so it's
[1:53] you'll know back in the Old Testament
[1:55] when a a child a man made himself a home
[1:59] he got his bride that's the first thing
[2:01] then he become a great man like an
[2:04] organization that was good
[2:07] the next thing happened there come a
[2:09] birth into that home that's when the
[2:11] Holy Spirit see another spirit came in
[2:14] which was the son that son he was not in
[2:19] full charge neither was he a heir until
[2:22] he got a certain age and he had to be
[2:24] proved first yes and then they had the
[2:30] law of adoption to you ministers the
[2:32] placing of a
[2:33] so I'm speaking up now then when he come
[2:36] to a place to where he was adopted Jesus
[2:41] gave a beautiful illustration of it on
[2:43] Mount Transfiguration as I said God will
[2:46] never go outside of his laws to do
[2:49] anything if you got an artesian well on
[2:52] this hill blowing water all over the air
[2:54] and on this other hill over here you've
[2:57] got a crop burning up you can stand on
[3:00] this healing hunter Oh water run over
[3:03] here and fill my crop all water get to
[3:06] my crop it'll never do it but if you
[3:09] work according to the laws of
[3:11] gravitation you can water that crop
[3:13] you've got a sick man laying here our
[3:16] sinner Lane you're a man that wants to
[3:18] be right can't give up drinking can't
[3:21] give up smoking can't give up the
[3:23] standing if you just work according to
[3:26] the laws of God that the Holy Spirit
[3:29] come in there then he's no more his own
[3:31] he he will stop that thing because the
[3:34] Holy Spirit takes him over but you've
[3:37] got to work according to the laws of God
[3:40] the rules of God now in the Old
[3:44] Testament when this baby was born they
[3:48] watched if the CIA was behaved behavior
[3:52] then the father being a great business
[3:55] man but this time maybe in his 40s or
[3:57] 50s he didn't have time to teach this
[4:01] baby itself so he got in them days they
[4:05] didn't have public schools as they have
[4:07] now so they got what they called a tutor
[4:09] or razor school teacher and this school
[4:13] teacher was the best he could find so
[4:17] that he'd be truthful and tell the
[4:19] father the truth about it and then when
[4:22] this boy got to a certain age say he was
[4:25] matured if that boy was just a renegade
[4:28] no good didn't care for the father's
[4:31] business all he thought about was
[4:32] flirtin and running with the women's are
[4:35] our drinking our gammon or horse-racing
[4:38] that boy would always be a son but he
[4:42] was never placed in position to have
[4:45] heir
[4:45] to all his father had but if he was a
[4:49] good boy and he was about the father's
[4:52] business and he proved to be the right
[4:54] child then they had a ceremony they took
[4:58] the boy out into the street and put a
[5:00] white robe on him and they study my onyx
[5:04] scaffold so all the city could see they
[5:07] made a feast and a jubilee and the
[5:10] father then had the ceremony of adoption
[5:13] he adopted his own son into his own
[5:18] business and then the Sun was co-equal
[5:22] with his father in other words have been
[5:25] today the son's name on the check was
[5:28] just as good as the daddy's now watch
[5:31] what God did when his son was born he
[5:35] let him go for 30 years testing him
[5:38] climbing then he give him 33 years of
[5:43] hard drive and then at the end of the
[5:47] hard trial when he seen that his son was
[5:50] about the father's business not
[5:53] transfiguration Buckelew he took Peter
[5:56] James and John three witnesses and went
[5:59] up on top of the mountain and there God
[6:03] performed the laws of adoption he they
[6:07] looked up and they seen Jesus and his
[6:10] clothes shined as white as the lightning
[6:14] and there's a cloud over shattered him
[6:17] and a voice come out of the cloud and
[6:20] said this is my beloved son
[6:24] [Music]
[6:30] I'll sit down now and have the water say
[6:33] well he says is Lord truth now the
[6:39] church has come through those schools
[6:42] she married back on a long time ago in
[6:45] become a denomination an organization
[6:48] but you notice the birth produced
[6:51] something else and now it's got to a
[6:54] place to where the Pentecostal church
[6:56] with the new birth has been tested and
[6:59] tried and now it's coming to a place God
[7:03] doesn't deal with the church at just an
[7:05] organization it doesn't deal with the
[7:08] church as a group of people he deals
[7:11] with the church as an individuals each
[7:14] individual in the church and now it's
[7:18] got to attack and it's no secret we all
[7:22] see it when a man proves and God loves
[7:27] him he takes him out somewhere to
[7:29] himself there is a front of angels he
[7:34] does something for him he lifts him up
[7:37] there in the presence of God and gives
[7:40] him and fills him in sin see now that's
[7:45] the age that we're living in same Holy
[7:48] Spirit that saved the Lutheran's that
[7:52] sanctified the Methodists that baptized
[7:54] the Pentecostals is now setting in order
[7:59] the coming of the Lord Jesus when it
[8:03] will be so powerful that body will come
[8:06] into this group of church that will
[8:08] throw the rest them from the grave there
[8:11] will be a resurrection that's what the
[8:15] Holy Ghost is far
[8:16] what is the only ghost without us they
[8:21] cannot be made perfect they lived in one
[8:24] day under that we live in another day
[8:26] when the enemy comes in like a flood all
[8:29] the Spirit of God will raise a standard
[8:31] against it mean we're in a day now back
[8:34] there there wasn't half as smart as
[8:36] today they
[8:37] make an atomic bomb or automobile they
[8:40] didn't have science and things as we
[8:42] have down well and things of mysterious
[8:45] things to try to say man blow together
[8:47] by some dust and so forth and take some
[8:50] analysis and try to prove it to make
[8:53] infidels out of people but now when we
[8:57] need it the Spirit of God raises a
[8:58] standard what it is pouring any spirit
[9:01] then those who are resting out yonder in
[9:04] the grave or under the altar of God as
[9:06] the scripture says her crying how long
[9:08] how much God's waiting on me and you the
[9:16] church is waiting on me that's in time
[9:23] God can pour into us his poulos his
[9:29] power his resurrection that when the
[9:33] church in Christ becomes so post
[9:35] together the Christ becomes visible
[9:38] among us and raises the dead and we go
[9:41] into the rapture now we're going to say
[9:43] show each one that just those who are
[9:46] filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that
[9:48] rapture for the rest of the Dead lived
[9:51] not for the space of a thousand years
[9:54] Brian just Holy Spirit filled people was
[9:59] all went in the rapture now God gave the
[10:05] Holy Spirit I got another scripture in
[10:06] John 14:12 that's a very familiar
[10:10] scripture with all the people here at
[10:12] Tabernacle barely barely I say unto you
[10:15] he that believeth on me now don't let
[10:20] that word believeth Conny sets you back
[10:23] in a nominal church say yes I believe
[10:25] sure I believe Jesus Christ is the son
[10:28] of God the devil bleeds the same thing
[10:32] exactly the Bible said he does but the
[10:36] scripture says and John that no man can
[10:40] call Jesus that Christ only by the Holy
[10:43] Ghost you've actually by the scripture
[10:48] let me stop here just a minute for
[10:50] finish reading
[10:51] you are not converted until you've
[10:54] received the Holy Ghost it's right you
[10:59] are believing on - the Holy Spirit is
[11:03] spoke to you and you publicly confessed
[11:06] him the devil has the same thing I
[11:08] believe him to be the Son of God so does
[11:10] the devil but you're walking on towards
[11:13] you when Peter had been called and
[11:19] justified by believing on the Lord Jesus
[11:21] Christ and in John 17:17 Jesus
[11:27] sanctified them through the word for the
[11:31] word was the truth and he was the word
[11:34] first Shawn says in the beginning was
[11:36] the word and the Word was with God and
[11:38] the Word was God and the Word was made
[11:40] flesh and dwelt among us
[11:42] he was the word so he sanctified them he
[11:46] said father speaking to the spirit in
[11:48] him I sanctify them to the world self
[11:54] Elaine his hands upon them ah word is
[11:58] the truth just merely spoke him into
[12:02] existence in the womb of a woman Oh
[12:07] totally impossible for him to be any
[12:10] other way than this word of God to make
[12:12] him manifest uh sanctify them he gave
[12:16] them power against unclean spirits they
[12:19] went out he put their names in the
[12:21] Lamb's Book of Life and he set them out
[12:24] John Matthew 10 and gave them power over
[12:28] unclean spirits cast out evil spirits
[12:31] and do works and so forth and they come
[12:34] back rejoicing said even the devils is
[12:37] subject to us he said don't rejoice
[12:39] because the devils is subject unto you
[12:41] but rejoice because your names in the
[12:44] book and Judas was with them see how
[12:49] close he can come right on up to
[12:51] justification move right on into
[12:53] sanctification but where did he show his
[12:56] light
[12:57] where did he show himself before
[12:59] Pentecost
[13:02] you show these colors what's that spirit
[13:05] will be justice past and justice
[13:07] sanctimonious as it can be
[13:09] until it comes to the Holy Ghost and
[13:11] they'll cut it off right there that's
[13:14] that spirit case you see it moving up
[13:17] there Antichrist and Jesus said they'd
[13:20] be so close together in the last days it
[13:23] would to see the very elected if
[13:25] possible but remember it's just the
[13:28] elected that will see it caused by
[13:33] election aren't you happy that you're
[13:37] one of them aren't you people here
[13:40] tonight no with you something in your
[13:42] heart tugging I want that Holy Spirit I
[13:44] want you Lord in my heart that's because
[13:47] God puts your name on the Lamb's Book of
[13:50] Life before the foundation of the world
[13:52] he said that no man can come to me said
[13:58] Jesus except my father has drawed him
[14:00] first and all that comes to me I'll give
[14:04] him eternal life what his eternal life
[14:06] the Holy Spirit eternal life take that
[14:09] word and rend in the Greek and it said
[14:10] Zoe Zoe is the Holy Spirit all that the
[14:15] father's giving me will come to me it
[14:17] all it comes to me I'll give him the
[14:19] Holy Ghost and all raising up at the
[14:22] last day I will do it he said no if it
[14:28] ends about it we'll all that comes and I
[14:32] give eternal life you'll have to raise
[14:34] cause you've got eternal line it has to
[14:37] come can't die no more than God can die
[14:40] oh my dear friends from around this
[14:46] country and in this little city if I
[14:49] could only with my human voice place
[14:53] into your heart the importance of
[14:55] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:58] it would be the most wonderful
[15:00] revelation that you ever had in your
[15:02] life to see what you must do it let me
[15:07] make that clear about you're not
[15:09] converted Peter had been saved
[15:12] he believed on the Lord followed him
[15:15] just told him who he was had him to
[15:18] following he gave him power against
[15:21] unclean spirits and sanctified him but
[15:24] after all of that and become the chief
[15:26] spokesman of the group as the Catholics
[15:31] were going to call it the bishop for the
[15:33] church or the Pope or whatever it was
[15:36] the head man of the church yet jesus
[15:40] said the night of his betrayal lovest
[15:43] thou me Peter and he said Lord you know
[15:48] I love you said feed my sheep
[15:50] he said that three times and Peter said
[15:54] you know I love you I'll go in through
[15:56] the the end and I'll go with you to the
[15:58] death and so forth he said before the
[16:02] clock has crowed three times you before
[16:05] the crows you will have denied me
[16:06] three times he said but Peter I prayed
[16:11] for you
[16:12] [Music]
[16:14] listen that's not all of it I have
[16:18] prayed for you and after you are
[16:21] converted then strengthen her brother
[16:30] after you are converted he'd shouted he
[16:35] had probably danced in the spirit you've
[16:38] done all kinds of things but he hadn't
[16:40] received the Holy Ghost ship after you
[16:44] are converted then strengthen your
[16:47] brethren that's true
[16:50] carry out his plan now let me finish
[16:55] reading John 14:12 now in the fourteenth
[17:01] chapter 12 where Jesus said verily
[17:03] verily I say in you he that believeth
[17:04] and you cannot believe believeth on me
[17:09] you could believe on to him how many
[17:13] understands that say hey man you
[17:15] remember in acts 19 I hate to stop this
[17:18] year but I just have to say it as it
[17:20] comes to me an ax the 19th chapter when
[17:26] this Baptist preacher which was a lawyer
[17:29] and was converted and he was preaching
[17:32] and getting people saved and they had
[17:35] great joy just rejoicing and shouting
[17:38] have any meeting X 18 equivalent
[17:41] priscilla we referred to it last evening
[17:44] and it went to see him and they note he
[17:47] was a great man and he was a student and
[17:49] he was proving by the Bible that Jesus
[17:52] was the son of God only knowing the
[17:56] baptism of John he didn't know the
[17:59] baptism the Holy Ghost yet so he said
[18:03] equivalent Priscilla that husband and
[18:04] wife little tent makers which Paul was a
[18:06] tent maker too and they'd received the
[18:09] Holy Ghost under Paul's teaching they
[18:11] said we got a little brothers coming up
[18:13] here let him talk to us a little bit
[18:15] about it and when Paul came up and heard
[18:18] him preach Tony was a great man he said
[18:21] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[18:24] you have
[18:26] they said we no not there were there be
[18:29] any Holy Ghost he said them - what are
[18:32] the real Greek word there is - how was
[18:35] you baptized they said we have been
[18:38] baptized already by John the Baptist now
[18:42] watch what Paul said Paul said that John
[18:46] barely baptized unto repentance not for
[18:52] remission of sins but unto repentance
[18:56] saying that's what you believe when you
[18:59] accept Christ as your personal Savior
[19:01] you're bleeding on to the baptism of the
[19:05] Holy Ghost that is not the baptism the
[19:08] Holy Ghost my dear Baptist brethren
[19:10] there is wrong a brother sent me - they
[19:14] said brother Branham or some time ago
[19:16] months ago he said brother Branham
[19:19] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[19:21] unto him for righteousness it truly said
[19:24] what more can a man do then believe us
[19:26] so that's all a man can do that's all he
[19:29] can do today's believe God but God gave
[19:33] him a seal of circumcision that we went
[19:36] through last night as a sign that he had
[19:39] accepted his faith in Him and today
[19:43] until God you believe unto Him when you
[19:46] accept him as your personal Savior but
[19:48] when God gives you the seal of the Holy
[19:51] Ghost he sealed you to your eternal
[19:54] destination
[19:56] now you Baptist take that and I'll go
[20:00] with you on eternal security yes sir
[20:03] because grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[20:05] God whereby you are sealed until the day
[20:08] of your redemption
[20:11] you are not single by bleeding onto but
[20:14] sealed by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30
[20:19] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[20:21] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[20:25] your redemption that seals you when you
[20:29] found favor with God and he sealed you
[20:33] by the Holy Spirit that sold for the
[20:36] Bible said no man can call jesus the
[20:41] christ only by the Holy Ghost you say I
[20:46] believe it because the pastor said so
[20:48] he's right but that doesn't count for
[20:52] you I believe it because the word says
[20:55] so that's right but the reason for you
[20:57] that doesn't count you the only way that
[21:00] you can say that Jesus is the Christ is
[21:02] when the Holy Ghost comes into you and
[21:05] bears record and witnesses itself out he
[21:07] is the son of God that's the only way
[21:10] you know the resurrection from the Holy
[21:13] Ghost bears record when he the Holy
[21:18] Ghost has come he will testify of me
[21:21] show you things to come bring these
[21:25] things I said to your memories you'll
[21:27] never find it in a school thing he will
[21:31] bring these things to your memories now
[21:34] we want to read just a little further in
[21:36] this scripture around st. John 14:12
[21:41] fairly burly I say you he that believeth
[21:43] on me the works that I do shall he do
[21:51] also and greater which the right
[21:54] translation air is more if you want to
[21:56] look it up greater works than these
[21:58] shall he do because I go to the Father
[22:01] if he went to the Father the Holy Spirit
[22:06] would come is that right another
[22:08] scripture said if I go not away the
[22:10] comforter will not come but if I go away
[22:14] I'll come again and be with you even in
[22:18] yin see it's God with you over you first
[22:22] with you in Christ in you in the Holy
[22:25] Ghost God in you now the works that I do
[22:31] shall you do also not another word
[22:35] but God wants to bring the Holy Ghost in
[22:39] you to continue the same work that he
[22:43] was doing in Christ the work wasn't so
[22:47] needy in the days of Luther that was
[22:49] God's church it wasn't a little bit
[22:52] bored here in the days of Wesley because
[22:55] the world the Bible said would get
[22:57] weaker and wiser and more wicked all the
[23:00] time we're the world's getting more
[23:03] wicked all that we know that one man do
[23:06] things today that a hundred years ago he
[23:09] would've thought they'd been a human
[23:11] being that cruel moral wicked all the
[23:15] time in the wicked shall do wicked here
[23:17] all the time said the scripture more and
[23:20] more so the Holy Spirit has been moving
[23:23] there's just a little breath of it with
[23:25] Luther a little blow of it with Wesley I
[23:28] know
[23:29] deeper boil it with the Pentecost
[23:33] the breath and spirit has become the
[23:37] same she's uniting together bringing
[23:40] forth that same powerful blow of the
[23:43] Holy Ghost like he did back there is
[23:46] manifesting the same works that he did
[23:49] back there is being manifested right
[23:51] today the same thing
[23:53] watch what Jesus said barely barely I
[23:57] say unto you the son can do nothing
[24:01] except he sees the father do it
[24:04] first what this father does he shows the
[24:08] son the father dwelleth in me he doeth
[24:10] the works see
[24:12] now notice here's another thing I like
[24:15] to say right here as Jesus said as the
[24:20] father has sent me as I watch as the
[24:26] father
[24:27] sent me so send I you
[24:32] as a father how did the father send the
[24:37] father that sent him come down from
[24:40] heaven and dwelt in he went forth he
[24:43] said I'll always do that which pleases
[24:45] my father see he went about doing the
[24:50] things that the father was showing him
[24:52] to do I do nothing except my father
[24:54] shows me first the God that sent him was
[24:58] on the inside of him and as the father
[25:02] sent me the same way the father sent me
[25:05] so I send you
[25:08] why are you carrying on what the same
[25:13] works the same Jesus said though he that
[25:17] believeth he that has me on the inside
[25:20] of him the Holy Spirit he that believeth
[25:22] that's already witnessed my resurrection
[25:24] know that I'm in iam he that's in me if
[25:27] he abide in me my words abide in you he

[25:58] high and polluted and educated or as we
[26:02] call it plutocrats if they don't want to

[26:06] God's able of these spoons to rational
[26:08] Abraham he'll take gangsters and
[26:11] bootleggers and everything else and rise
[26:13] up God can do it and he is doing it God
[26:19] able of these stones to rise children
[26:23] somebody's going to do it cause he's God
[26:27] if you abide me and my words and you
[26:30] asked what you will because you're
[26:32] asking his word and his word is live
[26:36] speak it if God said it in your street
[26:38] sense the Holy Ghost bears record that
[26:40] words right and there your brother speak
[26:43] up there it is say to this mountain be
[26:45] moved
[26:45] don't doubt in your heart but believe it
[26:47] watch it not you that speaketh but the
[26:52] father that dwelleth in you he doeth the
[26:54] talking it's not you talking to that
[26:56] mountain it's the father that's in you
[27:00] [Music]
[27:02] earth will pass away snip at my spirit
[27:05] shall honor my word shall not pass away
[27:08] certainly it cannot pass away father now
[27:13] the works that I do God is in his church
[27:16] to continue his works that's why I sent
[27:19] the Holy Ghost now you know that he
[27:23] knowed it wouldn't be it couldn't be
[27:25] done that way so was it by otherwise so
[27:27] he had to send the father sent the son
[27:29] for all the sin of fun son in you and
[27:32] the same works that he did the same very
[27:35] worse now that Jesus did you'll do also
[27:38] the church wouldn't you like to do the
[27:40] works of God Jesus said he if you don't
[27:43] do the works of God believe on me how
[27:46] you believe on him you can't do it you
[27:47] got the Holy Ghost
[27:48] all those no man can say he is the son
[27:50] of God you're saying what somebody else
[27:52] said the Bible said that he's the son of
[27:55] God I believe the Bible all right
[27:58] the Bible says the Son of God I believe
[28:00] the Bible the pastor says he's the son
[28:02] of God
[28:03] I believe the pastor mama says he's the
[28:05] son of God I believe
[28:06] mama my friend says he's a son of God I
[28:09] believe my friend but the only way that
[28:12] I can say is the Son of God is when the
[28:15] Holy Ghost comes in the best record of
[28:17] his self then I know he's the son of God
[28:22] no man can call Jesus Christ only by the
[28:25] Holy Ghost no man speaking by the Spirit
[28:30] of God called Jesus a curse our saying
[28:34] was something that day and something
[28:35] else today that makes him weak and fall
[28:38] free no sir he's the same yesterday
[28:40] today and forever any true spirit will
[28:44] bear record of that all right now he
[28:48] said these works that I do shall you
[28:50] also John 14:12 now the same works all
[28:54] they say the church does a greater work
[28:56] today in what manner he said the works
[28:58] that I do let me say well we got
[29:02] missionaries all over the world
[29:03] that's a greater work but he said the
[29:05] works that I do i do them do them first
[29:12] then talk about missionaries today
[29:17] speaking here sometime ago about a
[29:19] he said Mohammed's dead
[29:22] that's right he's in the grave but
[29:23] someday he arises he said if he rises
[29:26] from the grave the whole world know it
[29:27] in 24 hours he said you people say Jesus
[29:30] have been raised 2,000 years not one
[29:32] third of the people know it yet that's
[29:35] the calls that you spoke from an
[29:37] intellectual view of it you spoke from a
[29:40] standpoint of school or education if
[29:43] this whole great Church of God Mountain
[29:45] Catholic Protestant all other and
[29:47] receive the Holy Ghost this world be
[29:49] laying solid in Christianity there
[29:52] wouldn't be such a thing as communism
[29:53] that would be such a thing as strive for
[29:56] him in the feared meanness or hatred
[29:58] Jesus would be sitting on his throne
[30:00] we'd be walking through the paradises of
[30:03] God with eternal life living forever
[30:05] already resurrected in a new body
[30:07] walking around never to the old never be
[30:09] never be sick never to be hungry walking
[30:12] the joys of the Lord talking with the
[30:14] animals and oh what a day but we've done
[30:18] everything else besides party he said go
[30:20] you know where I preach the gospel
[30:23] what does the gospel not word only but
[30:25] through power and demonstrations of the
[30:27] Holy Ghost
[30:28] making the Word of God manifest as the
[30:30] gospel you can't do it now Jesus know
[30:35] that he had to live in his church
[30:37] therefore he know we'd have intellectual
[30:39] schools and you'll never get this in an
[30:43] intellectual school they'll be against
[30:45] it because all they know is some smart
[30:48] man's learning some creed or
[30:51] denomination they want to deliver by so
[30:54] they'll they'll set you up in that and
[30:56] make you a member of that body and
[30:57] brother quote some things to you Alba
[31:00] Creed that would seem like it was just
[31:02] perfect the great Holy Church the mother
[31:05] it's to Romania beat instead of many a
[31:08] pound so has it ever he's been kicked
[31:10] out of everywhere there is nearly and
[31:12] he's still going on just the same answer
[31:15] all they'll try to quote these so Jesus
[31:18] know that there'd be a great
[31:20] intellectual move just like there wasn't
[31:22] his days in Turin washing of pots and
[31:25] pans and wearing of clothes and
[31:26] turnaround collars and everything as it
[31:29] did all these different things that they
[31:30] would do he know they'd do that so he
[31:33] said not just wait a minute I'm going to
[31:37] not leave you comfortless I'm coming
[31:41] again to be with you therefore he said
[31:44] the works that I do you'll do also the
[31:46] purpose of sending the Holy Ghost was
[31:49] for God to continue through a bunch of
[31:51] people to continually manifest God to
[31:55] the world it's exactly not by Creed not
[31:58] by denomination but by the power of his
[32:01] resurrection I'm making his word real by
[32:05] taking his promise and standing on the
[32:08] side of the minority and believing God
[32:10] and what's the Black Stars move back in
[32:13] power of God move in and take over and
[32:15] then that's what he wants that's what
[32:18] the Holy Ghost was sent far
[32:20] that's why purpose he sent it for we
[32:22] know what it is now and that's why he
[32:24] sent it there's for no other blood would
[32:26] sanctify people I couldn't sanctify you
[32:29] and you couldn't sanctify me cause we're
[32:31] both born after sex
[32:32] but Jesus was born without sex that's
[32:36] right
[32:37] so his blood was the Sanctifier and God
[32:39] came down made a body lived in it shed
[32:42] that blood for the sanctifying of this
[32:44] was absolutely expel the guilty insane
[32:48] then to faith believing in that God
[32:51] comes right down into a human body by
[32:53] the sanctifying of that blood but seen
[32:56] Abraham's seed by faith to believe that
[32:58] that blood would come that pure blood
[33:00] that would be a miracle like his blood
[33:03] walked over there after his as good as
[33:05] dead
[33:05] bleed God for 25 years him 75 years old
[33:09] and bleed till he was a hundred and
[33:10] Sarah 65 and bleed till she was 90 and
[33:14] he was one as good as the dead and God
[33:17] said so the people won't be sure to miss
[33:20] it take him up y'all the hill and offer
[33:21] him up first sacrifice he said to the
[33:24] servant you stand here with the mule and
[33:27] wait the Sun and I'll go yonder and
[33:29] worship and the Sun and I shall return
[33:34] Oh is he going to do it
[33:38] Haber Sam said I'll receive him as one
[33:41] from the dead and I know that he that
[33:44] gives me as one from the dead is able to
[33:47] rise up from the dead if I only keep his
[33:50] word he keep his word he's able to raise
[33:55] him up from the dead perfectly speaking
[33:57] of Christ there he is
[34:00] through that blood cell come forth the
[34:02] Holy Ghost that had itself bound up in
[34:05] her body called Jesus that blood
[34:07] sanctified away by faith took all the
[34:10] redeemed are the elected a cop and when
[34:12] you've accepted that in the Holy
[34:13] Spirit's taking a whole the mean inside
[34:15] of you he moves right in God his self to
[34:17] work as well down here that mean boss's
[34:20] crab in this other old so-and-so over
