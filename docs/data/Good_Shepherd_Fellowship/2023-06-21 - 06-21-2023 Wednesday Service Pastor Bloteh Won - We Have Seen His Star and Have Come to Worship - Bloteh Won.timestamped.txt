[49:30] only scripture amen
[49:33] so let's read verse one now when Jesus
[49:36] was born in Bethlehem of Judea
[49:40] in the days of Herod the king behold
[49:43] there came wise men from the East to
[49:47] Jerusalem
[49:49] saying where is he
[49:52] that is born King of the Jews
[49:56] for we have seen his tie in the east
[50:00] and I come to worship Him
[50:04] praise the Lord
[50:05] since we've been talking about worship
[50:09] is so faith for us to go this direction
[50:11] tonight
[50:12] we have seen his time and have come to
[50:16] worship Him
[50:17] I hope that's what you have seen I hope
[50:20] that's what had drawn you here amen
[50:23] not the church we must see his time
[50:29] and
[50:31] and that style will pull you into true
[50:35] worship
[50:36] we have seen his time
[50:39] and I come to worship let's pray tonight
[50:43] Heavenly Father oh dear lord
[50:47] we are so grateful father
[50:49] we are so grateful for a people so

[50:55] assembly Lord
[50:56] that uh you have blessed us with
[51:00] and the people that you have also
[51:04] trusted to us oh God
[51:06] dear Lord father without your ability in
[51:10] the leadership of your Holy Spirit
[51:13] we will make Lord gather
[51:17] a mess of this Lord
[51:19] and that's why we need you
[51:21] we need you every hour
[51:24] and leaving this hour right now
[51:27] father that uh
[51:29] uh realizing that God
[51:32] we are not here for the Showmanship
[51:35] we are here for the Lord to be able to
[51:38] bring worship to you through the yearing
[51:40] of your word and the preaching of your
[51:43] word
[51:44] so Lord we we want to be captured in the
[51:47] sense of this Lord I believe Lord father
[51:50] that uh
[51:53] you the holy spirit is dealing with our
[51:56] local assembling trying to bring us to
[51:59] the place of worshiping God is spiriting
[52:02] in truth
[52:03] father Lord God and uh
[52:08] through the different messages Lord
[52:11] father God from all of the brothers Lord
[52:14] Jesus you you seem to be dealing with us
[52:16] in this direction
[52:17] and oh god father it is not something
[52:20] that we can produce of ourself

[52:26] we can manufacture
[52:29] but lord it's something that you have
[52:30] called us to
[52:32] and if we surrounded ourselves you will
[52:35] produce it through us because it is your
[52:38] work
[52:39] so father we pray that God you will
[52:42] bless the word now that we will be going
[52:45] into bless your children that are

[53:03] tonight and uh
[53:09] who to have a each and every one of you
[53:12] and we can all come together and
[53:16] fellowship tonight around the world
[53:18] praise the Lord before we go into what
[53:21] we want to speak about uh I want to
[53:24] remind you uh July uh the the middle
[53:28] week there of July
[53:31] around the 16th uh 15 16 that entire
[53:36] week is going to be our
[53:39] uh Good Shepherd Fellowship will be
[53:41] getting around 28 years around that
[53:46] weekend since uh the inspiration came on
[53:50] the on the brothers that started this
[53:53] local assembly it will be about 20 80
[53:56] years
[53:57] and uh I really never felt doing
[54:01] anything about anniversary until
[54:04] uh uh because in my mind I was I was
[54:09] believing that God will will do
[54:11] something Supernatural for us I lie I I
[54:14] I'm learning to believe God for big
[54:16] things amen praise the Lord I'm learning
[54:19] I'm not there yet I'm learning praise
[54:21] the Lord and uh you know uh uh uh
[54:27] Elijah said to Elijah
[54:31] what you asked for it's a hard thing
[54:34] praise the Lord and then sometimes we
[54:37] might ask God for hard things so we were
[54:39] believing that if if you know uh
[54:42] that the law will bless us some days to
[54:45] have a uh
[54:48] little building with little space than
[54:51] base let me now say a better building
[54:53] because this this is a better building
[54:55] amen praise the Lord and if for now is
[54:59] holding every one of us so it's a better
[55:01] building
[55:02] praise the Lord and and so let me now
[55:06] see a better building but a more special
[55:08] place okay a place that would be more
[55:11] special than uh than this place so uh we
[55:15] are believing God for that and I thought
[55:17] uh you know the law was going to bring
[55:19] it our way soon but I think
[55:23] you know uh maybe he want us to
[55:27] to
[55:30] um
[55:31] learn to start appreciating this one
[55:33] more
[55:34] so when we leave it we can miss it amen
[55:37] praise the Lord
[55:40] so uh that was that was some of the
[55:42] reason why we did this renovation
[55:45] you know uh opening the space even
[55:48] though uh uh Kovac
[55:50] came right into that but it was not
[55:54] mainly because of covet the plan was we
[55:57] were thinking to do at 25th
[56:00] anniversary
[56:02] so I felt like uh sensor uh as a pastor
[56:07] we couldn't give you a new building
[56:09] let's just paint it let's make it look
[56:11] new
[56:12] okay take the rooms from back there put
[56:15] a little book there then brother Jordan
[56:17] did all of that uh design for us and uh
[56:23] as it was it was one day I was I was
[56:25] here uh studying I was in the office the
[56:28] office used to be right back there where
[56:30] I brought a belt and uh sister Grace
[56:32] they are sitting there right in their
[56:34] office they praise the Lord that's why
[56:36] the old office used to be and then it
[56:39] just it just it just you know it just
[56:42] hit my mind and I went back there to the
[56:45] cry room
[56:46] I measure the space I said well I think
[56:48] I can put an office here and we can get
[56:50] rid of that and and then I saw the idea
[56:53] to brother Jordan he says well and uh it
[56:57] is said and let it be done praise the
[56:59] Lord
[57:00] put his stem on it and and but that
[57:04] coming week we will
[57:06] we will we want to just have something
[57:09] we want to do it in-house
[57:12] we want to do it in-house and uh
[57:16] just just so we can
[57:18] remain humble we want to do it in-house
[57:21] so it's going to be a house thing even
[57:23] though we will be selling invitation out
[57:27] to few of the brothers uh
[57:30] you know there has there has two with us
[57:32] all of these years where the prayer will
[57:34] be speaking for us that uh that we can
[57:37] and I think uh that Saturday brother
[57:40] Jordan has both right for everyone that
[57:43] can make themselves available I hope you
[57:45] are reading the flyer uh
[57:48] uh that's what they are praying the fall
[57:50] that's why they were handed out to you
[57:52] and uh and and some other things and
[57:56] what is what is also uh amazing with
[57:59] that is that uh
[58:01] uh
[58:02] I'm also coming around 30 years in the
[58:05] ministry
[58:07] and I told you a couple of years ago
[58:09] that when I get 30 years then I will be
[58:12] more serious I'll be more mature for 30
[58:15] years is the age of maturity
[58:18] in the ministry so I'm getting getting
[58:21] around 30 years
[58:25] praise the Lord
[58:27] so uh I feel good about it because I'm
[58:30] two years older than the church
[58:33] so I feel I feel very good about it
[58:40] praise the Lord so I just I just said
[58:43] there just to remind you and uh
[58:47] so
[58:49] what I would like for us to do while I I
[58:52] don't know maybe at the beginning of the
[58:54] July month or maybe that week I want for
[58:58] us to just uh uh get back to our prayer
[59:02] chain you know where we will have uh
[59:04] people on certain hours of the day
[59:07] praying and for one another praying for
[59:10] the need of this church and uh
[59:14] I just want for us to
[59:17] just commit
[59:19] at this place in the hands of the Lord
[59:21] amen that the Lord will will help us and
[59:24] then he will he will bless us and be
[59:26] with us so tonight just like we have
[59:28] read
[59:31] you know there was there was an amazing
[59:32] thing that took place on Sunday uh
[59:35] experienced the scene when I was down in
[59:37] Anchorage preaching uh I I caught I
[59:40] caught the court in uh and uh and I
[59:42] started becoming sick
[59:46] but it's Saturday night service
[59:49] I mean we had a wonderful service we had
[59:51] I mean the power of God came down so
[59:53] strong one young brother was preaching
[59:55] and uh you know and I could just feel I
[1:00:00] could feel healing going through my body
[1:00:03] so during the prayer line there were a
[1:00:05] lot of people that came out to pray
[1:00:07] and the pastor asked that we come out to
[1:00:10] pray and just before that I found myself
[1:00:12] sweating you know uh and Anchorage was
[1:00:16] cold around that time that's that's what
[1:00:17] gave me the call so uh uh and I was
[1:00:21] going to preach the next morning to
[1:00:23] close the meeting so I think the Lord
[1:00:25] came in a special way to heal me and
[1:00:27] strengthening me for the service in the
[1:00:29] morning and then he blessed the meeting
[1:00:31] and I felt the same way on Sunday I mean
[1:00:34] when I was when I was here asking
[1:00:36] brother Jordan to come up I mean I was
[1:00:38] just not myself I was singing with the
[1:00:41] kids and I spoiled their song because I
[1:00:43] didn't have voice and I just couldn't
[1:00:45] stand up too long I was just feeling I
[1:00:48] don't know what is there but uh
[1:00:50] uh
[1:00:52] but while I was in the office and the
[1:00:55] service was going on listening to the
[1:00:56] word uh I just I just felt the presence
[1:00:59] came over me and and since then I've
[1:01:03] been feeling much better than I said
[1:01:06] I mean Fair before the service so I
[1:01:09] thank the Lord for that amen I thank the
[1:01:12] Lord
[1:01:13] we have seen his style
[1:01:15] in the east and I come to worship Him
[1:01:18] Praise the Lord now so I I want to speak
[1:01:21] on there tonight and uh
[1:01:29] the reason is the other uh Jordan pick
[1:01:32] up from where we were speaking and I
[1:01:35] think is the leadership of the holy
[1:01:37] spirit because I I was going to go into
[1:01:40] there the father seeketh such to worship
[1:01:42] so uh uh that's that's what I want to go
[1:01:45] to tonight praise the Lord
[1:01:48] that's where I want to go to tonight
[1:01:50] first I would like to before I start uh
[1:01:54] just just to be able to give you an idea
[1:01:57] here I would like to
[1:02:00] to
[1:02:00] look at this word uh
[1:02:04] uh in the
[1:02:05] I took this from out of the
[1:02:08] the concordance the Bible concordance of
[1:02:11] the Hebrew concordance the words seek
[1:02:15] the word sick the father seeketh such to
[1:02:19] worship
[1:02:20] praise the Lord
[1:02:22] now uh
[1:02:26] I will not be able to pronounce that
[1:02:29] Hebrew word
[1:02:30] and uh
[1:02:34] but the the idea that I want for us to
[1:02:37] get here is the other
[1:02:39] just like over in Genesis chapter 3 when
[1:02:43] men fail
[1:02:45] the Bible says God came down in the code
[1:02:48] of the evening
[1:02:50] and he started to say call out Adam Adam
[1:02:53] where are you praise the Lord
[1:02:57] and he was he was because you come down
[1:03:01] in the evening for Fellowship you come
[1:03:03] down in the evening for worship
[1:03:06] and uh and Yaris said that he he came
[1:03:08] down for worship and Adam was was
[1:03:12] nowhere to be found I mean Adam has has
[1:03:15] cut has got himself in another situation
[1:03:18] and and he was trying to hide himself
[1:03:21] from the presence of the Lord so here's
[1:03:23] God coming down in the court of the
[1:03:25] evening and then he's calling out to
[1:03:28] Adam he's calling out to Adam he's he
[1:03:31] was actually calling you know to that
[1:03:36] to that uh uh uh uh Divine
[1:03:40] representation that was in Adam he was
[1:03:42] calling to Adam's Soul Adam here in his
[1:03:45] body is standing in condemnation Adam in
[1:03:49] his body he's standing in the field of
[1:03:51] what he have done
[1:03:53] but but God calling him not in the sense
[1:03:56] that God don't know what Adam have done
[1:03:58] or God don't know where Adam is or The
[1:04:01] Situation he's in but God was calling
[1:04:04] him because that's what we are made for
[1:04:07] praise the Lord that's what we are made
[1:04:10] We Are Made To Worship the Lord we are
[1:04:13] made for Fellowship that's what God
[1:04:16] never wanted to be lonely he decided to
[1:04:20] express himself
[1:04:21] so he can have people in every age
[1:04:26] that's why a prophet will say God will
[1:04:28] never be without a witness
[1:04:31] the whole world can go crazy the whole
[1:04:34] world can go into I idolatry the whole
[1:04:37] word I mean they can blaspheme God will
[1:04:41] always have a witness and then he will I
[1:04:44] always have one Soul he will have one
[1:04:47] person that will be crying unto God I
[1:04:50] need more of God praise the Lord amen I
[1:04:53] want to get back to the house of God I
[1:04:55] want to get I want to experience what
[1:04:58] they experience on the day of Pentecost
[1:05:00] so God will never be without a witness
[1:05:02] because his purpose of creation
[1:05:05] yeah his purpose of creation was for
[1:05:09] Fellowship
[1:05:10] amen was for Fellowship
[1:05:13] it was for him to express himself
[1:05:16] and that we can be able to know him in
[1:05:19] the way he expressed himself and that is
[1:05:22] the thing that draws us to God mold and
[1:05:26] mold and more praise the Lord so I was
[1:05:29] looking at this and I was kind of for
[1:05:31] studying this uh uh all through the week
[1:05:34] so if you look here you will see of
[1:05:36] Uncertain affirmity to seek literal uh
[1:05:40] literally or figuratively
[1:05:43] you will see also in the in the in the
[1:05:45] in the uh uh the Hebrew sense to worship
[1:05:51] a means in God and it says here also
[1:05:54] this this is where it caught my
[1:05:55] attention uh yeah it says all in a bad
[1:05:59] sense to plot
[1:06:02] so you see in every age God plotted
[1:06:05] against you
[1:06:08] he plotted against you
[1:06:10] he decided to trap you I was looking at
[1:06:14] it also in in the Greek as we go down
[1:06:16] we'll bring we'll bring more to you in a
[1:06:19] bad sense
[1:06:20] to plot against life
[1:06:23] to go to about desired endeavoring
[1:06:26] inquiring required to seek after
[1:06:31] to seek
[1:06:33] after for means to compare
[1:06:38] praise the Lord
[1:06:43] so what what the the sense that I want
[1:06:45] for us to get here is that
[1:06:48] God was the first messenger after the
[1:06:52] fall
[1:06:54] he was the first messenger
[1:06:57] Brother Band said when he fell when man
[1:06:59] fell
[1:07:00] God never sent an angel to call him back
[1:07:03] God came down himself
[1:07:07] praise the Lord
[1:07:09] and and what he was doing is that you
[1:07:11] think about this Adam fell and God came
[1:07:15] down called Adam with with with a bleed
[1:07:19] with a bleeding skin in his hands
[1:07:22] yeah praise the Lord
[1:07:23] or in other mind he's he's condemning
[1:07:27] and and uh uh I mean he's he's hiding
[1:07:30] himself but God already make a provision
[1:07:33] he's coming down with the provision he's
[1:07:36] not asked he's not coming down and
[1:07:37] telling Adam you go clean yourself up
[1:07:39] and come back to church he's coming down
[1:07:42] with the provision
[1:07:44] praise the Lord everything that we need
[1:07:47] to get in the presence of God is
[1:07:49] provided by God it's not when we stay
[1:07:52] away to make ourselves right no but as
[1:07:55] we come into the presence of God he
[1:07:58] handles things over to us by his spirit
[1:08:06] praise the Lord
[1:08:07] so God comes down with the bleeding King
[1:08:10] and he says Adam Adam where are you and
[1:08:13] and he has the ablities came before him
[1:08:16] that's the first thing that Adam saw
[1:08:20] praise the Lord
[1:08:21] amen I believe when Adam saw the blood
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:08:28] you know he got nervous
[1:08:31] he says wow
[1:08:34] but you see the the blood of that top of
[1:08:38] that bleeding lamb also identify with
[1:08:41] the blood that Adam saw where he fell
[1:08:44] right
[1:08:49] are we together
[1:08:53] now so you see then God comes and he
[1:08:56] take the bleeding skin and then he wrap
[1:08:58] Adam in that skin
[1:09:02] so what is so what is he doing
[1:09:05] in one sense he's comparing Adam whether
[1:09:09] you like it or not
[1:09:11] this is the purpose why I created you
[1:09:14] you can't get away from it
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:20] what are you liking is not your choice
[1:09:23] of being here tonight in as much as you
[1:09:27] make all effort to be here it's not your
[1:09:30] choice
[1:09:32] is God all through the day since you
[1:09:35] wake up he starts wavering in the cells
[1:09:39] of your body in your heart in your mind
[1:09:41] doing things in in whatever way whether
[1:09:44] you have to go to work whatever we had
[1:09:46] to do throughout the day but in some way
[1:09:49] he make things to work our world our
[1:09:52] mind was made up I'll be in church
[1:09:54] tonight
[1:10:00] praise the Lord
[1:10:03] so the father
[1:10:05] seeking such
[1:10:08] it's not that uh uh uh uh uh he's
[1:10:13] looking and begging people
[1:10:16] no
[1:10:19] in every age the reason why God sent the
[1:10:23] prophets throughout the ages the reason
[1:10:26] why he sent the messenger through the
[1:10:28] Gentile age
[1:10:30] was to be able to call his children
[1:10:34] to wash it
[1:10:36] this message has come to sort us
[1:10:40] a fine us to bring us to the place of
[1:10:44] Truth worship that I will bring us to
[1:10:47] the place of of a worship that is now
[1:10:50] only limited in church
[1:10:52] right praise the Lord
[1:10:54] bring us to the place the consciousness
[1:10:59] amen that Consciousness that we have we
[1:11:03] have of God in the things that we do the
[1:11:06] things that we say
[1:11:12] are we together
[1:11:15] so the father has come
[1:11:19] to compare us
[1:11:24] praise the Lord
[1:11:30] guarding himself on his throne
[1:11:36] he watched over our lives
[1:11:40] and he set up his time
[1:11:44] about this time I'm going to get down I
[1:11:48] will deal with that heart
[1:11:50] of that man or that woman they might not
[1:11:52] understand
[1:11:54] is it God God you know God is now so
[1:11:56] much concerned about you understanding
[1:11:58] what he's doing because he know he will
[1:12:00] bring you there
[1:12:02] if you try to figure it in your on your
[1:12:04] own you will never get there
[1:12:06] he knows that he will bring you there so
[1:12:09] his problem is not to make you to
[1:12:12] understand first
[1:12:14] praise the Lord
[1:12:17] amen
[1:12:20] that's what blood Brown said in the
[1:12:22] message one that she said he says uh uh
[1:12:25] uh God on the day of Pentecost he said
[1:12:29] God distributed himself
[1:12:32] Amen in the form of all of those lies he
[1:12:36] said to gather himself back to himself
[1:12:39] yes that's the reason why over the heads
[1:12:43] of all of those Believers that were in
[1:12:45] the upper room the Bible says there was
[1:12:47] a clothing tongue of fire over their
[1:12:50] head so the great Pillar of Fire break
[1:12:52] himself into many pieces
[1:12:57] and everybody that was seeing the Savage
[1:12:59] had a representation of that over them
[1:13:02] praise the Lord and I believe that every
[1:13:05] one of us have a representation of that
[1:13:07] clothing fire over us tonight
[1:13:09] whether you like it or not that is the
[1:13:11] thing that compare you
[1:13:13] that is the thing that gave you the
[1:13:15] drive to move on to serve God that is
[1:13:19] the thing that gave you the desire to
[1:13:20] pray
[1:13:30] we have seen his time
[1:13:33] and have come
[1:13:35] to worship Him
[1:13:38] praise the Lord
[1:13:40] amen
[1:13:42] now this this uh this the the the the
[1:13:46] this that the wise man was saying we
[1:13:49] have seen his thought that that was the
[1:13:52] prophecy
[1:13:54] there was a prophecy of villain
[1:13:57] over enormous 24
[1:13:59] verse 17.
[1:14:02] Balaam prophesied that a star will rise
[1:14:05] out of Jacob
[1:14:07] now so tonight what I want to do and uh
[1:14:10] and trust that the law will help me is
[1:14:15] that I want for us to First realize and
[1:14:17] and establish here that that's time
[1:14:22] that was to rise out of Jacob
[1:14:25] amen
[1:14:27] bilam said a star will rise out of Jacob
[1:14:31] praise the Lord
[1:14:33] and uh and and and and and the era said
[1:14:36] that uh uh uh the uh this this wise man
[1:14:40] you know that came all the way down from
[1:14:43] Babylon they saw this time praise the
[1:14:45] Lord but you will see here that uh as
[1:14:48] you as you said it through the message
[1:14:50] and few of them we will look at tonight
[1:14:51] brother Brandon make us to realize
[1:14:55] that that star out of Jacob
[1:14:59] was nothing less than the pillow of Fire
[1:15:06] it was nothing less than the pillar of
[1:15:10] Fire
[1:15:15] praise the Lord
[1:15:16] now you what what what makes it
[1:15:19] beautiful is that that was the first
[1:15:22] form of God
[1:15:25] the first form that the invisible God
[1:15:29] took
[1:15:31] what we call the logos
[1:15:33] was a body of light
[1:15:39] that was the first form of God
[1:15:44] and it's very interesting that uh that
[1:15:47] that God choose
[1:15:49] to lead us
[1:15:51] by his first manifestation
[1:15:58] are we together
[1:16:01] praise the Lord
[1:16:04] you love the Lord tonight
[1:16:07] amen amen Fellowship by Redemption
[1:16:09] brother Branham said
[1:16:17] he says now in the beginning
[1:16:23] when uh no let's let's leave that one
[1:16:25] let's get to the maniac of garada I will
[1:16:29] come back to that
[1:16:30] that would that would just take me out
[1:16:32] of out of tough yeah
[1:16:36] he says look at the stars that led the
[1:16:39] wise man
[1:16:41] it comes over every Observatory then
[1:16:44] everything is
[1:16:45] and no one's seen it but then
[1:16:50] it was just giving for them to see
[1:16:54] look at Paul
[1:16:57] when he had the vision
[1:17:00] was knocked off
[1:17:02] his hearse and and fell
[1:17:05] off his hearse of whatever
[1:17:08] when he was on the road of Damascus see
[1:17:12] is just giving for some to see and some
[1:17:16] cannot see it that's exactly right
[1:17:19] so when
[1:17:21] so so when we all get to Glory
[1:17:25] when when when the days are over I'm
[1:17:28] going to make this statement I believe
[1:17:31] it was all I believe it was all my heart
[1:17:36] I believe with all of my heart
[1:17:38] we read in the Bible that it was the
[1:17:42] pillar of fire that led the children of
[1:17:44] the the children of Israel from Egypt
[1:17:47] into the promised land is that right
[1:17:50] and that pillow of fire was the angel of
[1:17:54] the Covenant is that right
[1:17:57] teachers
[1:17:58] and who was the angel of the Covenant
[1:18:02] Jesus Christ
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:06] and he is he is the same then yesterday
[1:18:09] today and forever
[1:18:12] is that right what does that mean
[1:18:15] he's still leading the church
[1:18:19] he is the Angel of the Covenant the
[1:18:23] Covenant was written with his own blood
[1:18:28] and
[1:18:30] he went into the presence of the father
[1:18:33] packing his own blood is that right
[1:18:37] he says and now this is the same Holy
[1:18:42] Spirit
[1:18:43] now watch now
[1:18:46] he says the pillow of fire is the Angel
[1:18:50] of the Covenant
[1:18:52] amen the angel of the Covenant is our
[1:18:57] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:58] amen
[1:19:00] and as he continually he says
[1:19:03] now this same Holy Spirit
[1:19:08] you have to you have to think about it
[1:19:10] in a way Jesus said I will go and the
[1:19:13] comforter we come
[1:19:14] so is Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:17] nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[1:19:20] what he wants us to understand
[1:19:22] now this same Holy Spirit
[1:19:26] and they said George J Lance said it
[1:19:30] looked like an uh uh an amarylight
[1:19:34] a burning wafer flipping flame like that
[1:19:40] I said well around and around like that
[1:19:44] look like it was going in a cycle
[1:19:49] of Wheeling around now so what is he
[1:19:52] talking about he's talking about
[1:19:55] the the pillow fight that was taken in
[1:19:57] Houston the 19 1950 pillow fight that
[1:20:01] came over brother Branham now so what
[1:20:03] what what is the connection that he's
[1:20:05] making here
[1:20:06] he's making us to realize that these are
[1:20:10] not just different beings
[1:20:13] this is the same manifestation
[1:20:17] praise the Lord so when God condescended
[1:20:20] and took the body of a light called the
[1:20:24] logos
[1:20:25] amen and by that Lord God he created all
[1:20:29] things right amen and then in in the
[1:20:32] book of collusion he will say he created
[1:20:35] All Things by Jesus Christ why that was
[1:20:38] uh uh uh uh uh a pre-figure of Jesus
[1:20:42] Christ
[1:20:44] are we together
[1:20:46] amen so you see that it was the same
[1:20:49] light
[1:20:51] it was the same light that created all
[1:20:53] things and that line came in the form of
[1:20:57] the pillar of fire to lead his people
[1:21:01] all through the the the the the the ages
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:07] and they returned back to the church
[1:21:16] are we together
[1:21:17] Jesus says I am the light of the word
[1:21:21] are we together
[1:21:23] Saint John chapter one let's look there
[1:21:25] quickly
[1:21:32] that's the reason why Paul said in
[1:21:34] Romans no man have sought God
[1:21:40] no is that light that that is seeking us
[1:21:45] is that light that is drawing us
[1:21:48] praise the Lord just like in the natural
[1:21:51] if you should be passing in the place
[1:21:54] and you see the reflection of light
[1:21:56] comes through a hold
[1:21:58] the moment it grabs your eye the next
[1:22:01] thing in your mind was there
[1:22:06] light has a drawing power
[1:22:12] the light has a drawing power you see
[1:22:15] that's the reason why the revelation of
[1:22:18] this word will draw you to the image of
[1:22:20] Christ
[1:22:22] if the word is not revealed to you you
[1:22:25] will play Church
[1:22:27] in and out of church but the constant
[1:22:30] revelation of the word will bring you
[1:22:32] closer all the time because light has a
[1:22:36] drawing power
[1:22:48] the Bible says in the beginning was the
[1:22:51] word
[1:22:53] Saint John 1 and the Word was with God
[1:22:56] and the Word was God the scene was in
[1:22:58] the beginning with God all things were
[1:23:01] created by Him and without him was not
[1:23:04] anything
[1:23:05] made that was made in him was life
[1:23:09] and the life was the what
[1:23:15] in him was life and the life was what
[1:23:21] life was the light of man
[1:23:25] the life was the light of man
[1:23:31] that same light from the beginning that
[1:23:33] created all things
[1:23:35] praise the Lord
[1:23:37] that same logos
[1:23:43] in the time of the church ages I mean in
[1:23:45] a time of uh uh uh the joining of Israel
[1:23:48] it became the pillar of Fire
[1:23:54] it comes upright by night
[1:23:57] and in the day is covered by Cloud it
[1:24:01] becomes the pillow of clown it was just
[1:24:03] the same light
[1:24:05] it was not two different lights
[1:24:07] no in the day it's covered by clown it
[1:24:10] becomes the pillar of cloud
[1:24:13] in the night the cloud roll back
[1:24:16] it's bright it's visible the people can
[1:24:19] see it
[1:24:21] it was pleased to lead them
[1:24:25] you just think about it
[1:24:27] not lie standing right there and they
[1:24:30] can see it yeah
[1:24:36] praise the Lord
[1:24:42] do you know what it was
[1:24:44] when brother Branham was preaching the
[1:24:46] church age
[1:24:48] and that very same Pillar of Fire came
[1:24:51] down in the building and went to the
[1:24:53] back of the war of the building
[1:24:55] and started drawing the church ages on
[1:24:57] the wall
[1:24:59] can you imagine
[1:25:02] that brother Banner would tell the
[1:25:03] people to look back can you imagine the
[1:25:05] ceiling that was in the room
[1:25:12] praise the Lord
[1:25:14] that feeling
[1:25:15] ought to be with us every time
[1:25:19] when we pick up the word there must be a
[1:25:22] capturing feeling there must be a
[1:25:24] feeling that capture us
[1:25:27] praise the Lord
[1:25:34] oh the devil knows that very well
[1:25:38] amen
[1:25:44] so whenever you want to read your Bible
[1:25:46] on the phone and then that's that's when
[1:25:48] all the WhatsApp messaging and all the
[1:25:50] the option or everything stop busting
[1:25:54] just to play with your mind
[1:25:56] because he knows that there is a drawing
[1:26:00] power
[1:26:02] there is a drawing power
[1:26:04] and that's the thing that changes you
[1:26:07] from glory to glory
[1:26:09] that's the thing that affects our life
[1:26:21] he must life and that life
[1:26:24] that life was the light
[1:26:28] of man
[1:26:29] his life is our light
[1:26:35] his life is our light
[1:26:42] and that light shattered in darkness and
[1:26:44] darkness
[1:26:45] cannot comprehend it
[1:26:48] praise the Lord Darkness cannot
[1:26:51] comprehend it do you realize how dark

[1:31:49] and it's all through the message you can
[1:31:51] study it I mean that uh that that caught
[1:31:54] my attention some years ago how brother
[1:31:56] Brandon tied the pillar of fire to the
[1:31:58] to the star that led the wise man it's
[1:32:01] the same light
[1:32:03] praise the Lord

[1:32:41] make us to rise above the the trials of
[1:32:45] the time
[1:32:50] praise the Lord
[1:32:53] and I would just I was just read in
[1:32:55] India to uh getting ready and the
[1:32:58] thoughts struck my mind
[1:33:02] the wise thing to do
[1:33:04] just like the wise man
[1:33:09] wise man
[1:33:10] with all with all the the the knowledge
[1:33:14] and and the wisdom and all the things
[1:33:17] that is steady
[1:33:18] yet
[1:33:20] they follow a star
[1:33:25] they follow a star a light in the
[1:33:29] heavens
[1:33:31] identify
[1:33:34] over two years
[1:33:39] over two years
[1:33:42] and that light LED them right to word
[1:33:46] the Christ child was born
[1:33:53] that light LED them right to work
[1:33:57] God became flesh
[1:33:59] and I'm telling you if you follow this
[1:34:01] light
[1:34:02] if you follow this light that has shine
[1:34:06] in our day it will lead you to the world
[1:34:09] being flesh because that's God's desire
[1:34:11] is not to lead you to a church is to
[1:34:14] lead you to a place where the word will
[1:34:16] become flesh and this time is not in
[1:34:19] another body but in your body
[1:34:25] praise the Lord
[1:34:27] wise men follow
[1:34:30] the wise men of our age did not like to
[1:34:33] follow they'll know too much
[1:34:36] but wise men streptural wise man
[1:34:40] they follow
[1:34:42] the wise things to do in this Dark Age
[1:34:46] is to follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:34:48] Spirit
[1:34:49] the wise thing to do
[1:34:52] in an age where we just can't put
[1:34:54] everything right
[1:34:56] you should follow the start and go and
[1:34:59] worship
[1:35:00] sometimes we want to get everything
[1:35:02] right before we can worship no
[1:35:05] God is comparing us
[1:35:07] sometimes he's trapping us into
[1:35:10] situation
[1:35:11] sure praise the Lord just like he had
[1:35:15] Paul and Silas embracing bows and chains
[1:35:19] he trapped them he imprisoned them
[1:35:22] praise the Lord for them to bring
[1:35:24] worship that will break the praise in
[1:35:26] open
[1:35:32] it's not our choice it's the father's
[1:35:34] choice
[1:35:36] he seeketh such to worship
[1:35:40] he has sought us
[1:35:42] he watched our Jain over our Jane for
[1:35:45] four generations
[1:35:50] praise the Lord
[1:36:00] and if he have choose us and if he have
[1:36:02] caught us
[1:36:04] there's no way we can get out of here
[1:36:05] people
[1:36:07] let's realize we don't have no choice
[1:36:10] the easy way out
[1:36:12] is our surrender all
[1:36:14] that's the easy way out I surrounded all
[1:36:18] because
[1:36:20] for a time like this
[1:36:22] you were born
[1:36:24] yeah
[1:36:25] for a time like this that's what
[1:36:28] Mordecai told Esther for a time like
[1:36:30] this
[1:36:43] praise the Lord
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:52] now as we look at this together let's go
[1:36:56] back to that according Fellowship by
[1:36:58] Redemption let me take that and then I
[1:37:01] just close on the thought here
[1:37:03] now in the beginning when God made the
[1:37:06] man to worship Him
[1:37:08] he live
[1:37:10] God
[1:37:12] taking care of him
[1:37:14] fed him
[1:37:16] made him a perfect fellowship with God
[1:37:19] man had a perfect Fellowship of God
[1:37:22] sorry now when I read this
[1:37:26] there was there was a top that struck my
[1:37:28] mind
[1:37:29] and that's what I've I've included in my
[1:37:32] notes and the thought that struck my
[1:37:34] mind let's go back to the beginning
[1:37:35] Broadband says in the beginning when God
[1:37:39] made the man to worship Him
[1:37:42] and live
[1:37:44] God taken care of him
[1:37:50] praise the Lord that was the thought
[1:37:53] that struck my mind
[1:37:56] if many of us can be
[1:38:03] grateful to the Lord tonight
[1:38:06] you'll realize that
[1:38:10] the Lord has been
[1:38:12] so good to us
[1:38:14] amen
[1:38:16] more than sometimes we realize
[1:38:22] or we get a little uh uh flu bark here
[1:38:26] and a little headache year and a little
[1:38:28] tiredness because sometimes we don't
[1:38:29] rest enough
[1:38:32] but he keeps us from sicknesses
[1:38:37] he keep us from sicknesses
[1:38:42] we might not had a a huge stock in the
[1:38:46] in the you know in in in the financial
[1:38:48] Market
[1:38:50] but he's been able to meet our needs
[1:38:54] barbam says when God made man to worship
[1:38:57] him God took care of him
[1:39:01] God took care of him
[1:39:04] when he popped those people in the
[1:39:06] wilderness
[1:39:08] for 40 years
[1:39:12] they didn't know her choice
[1:39:15] they had to follow the leadership God
[1:39:17] took care of them even though they were
[1:39:20] not at their best they were arguing they
[1:39:22] were fussing but God it was his
[1:39:25] responsibility
[1:39:27] amen he took them from their jobs
[1:39:31] he took them from their businesses they
[1:39:33] were doing in Egypt
[1:39:37] and he took care of them
[1:39:43] and I believe that the Lord is taking
[1:39:45] care of us
[1:39:48] he's taking care of us
[1:39:51] it's just that sometimes our wants are
[1:39:54] more than our needs
[1:39:57] but the Lord is taking care of us
[1:40:03] if we will just be grateful
[1:40:08] laudisha has filled our eyes and fill
[1:40:11] our mind and and and and and and and and
[1:40:14] every morning sales comes through the
[1:40:16] mail
[1:40:17] the mail is filled with things that are
[1:40:19] on discount

[1:40:23] amen
[1:40:32] a new uh start of shoes you only have
[1:40:36] two feet how many shoes you wear

[1:40:42] not blasting anybody
[1:40:44] okay I'm not blasting anybody I'm I'm
[1:40:47] just trying to capture us into something
[1:40:49] here that the Lord
[1:40:52] has been good to us
[1:40:54] the Lord is taking care of us
[1:40:58] he's taking care of us
[1:41:01] he has called us to worship Him he has
[1:41:05] called us to represent him in this age
[1:41:08] praise the Lord if you realize that God
[1:41:12] is obligated
[1:41:16] praise the Lord
[1:41:17] it is only when we try to drag his
[1:41:20] Blessing in the mark of sin and we try
[1:41:23] to drag his blessing to our own
[1:41:26] personality and both in frame that God
[1:41:29] steps back
[1:41:32] but if we would try our best to be a Son
[1:41:34] of God or the daughter of God God will
[1:41:37] take care of you
[1:41:47] praise the Lord
[1:41:50] amen
[1:41:57] God taking care of him fed him man had a
[1:42:02] perfect fellowship with God there was
[1:42:05] nothing wrong
[1:42:07] God came down in the evening and talked
[1:42:10] to Adam and Eve what a perfect picture
[1:42:13] no harm
[1:42:15] nothing could harm them no sickness
[1:42:19] whoever come to them
[1:42:26] praise the Lord
[1:42:30] even if the doctor have said something
[1:42:33] about your blood pressure
[1:42:34] you know that you feel better than than
[1:42:36] that blood pressure
[1:42:38] you feel much better than that blood
[1:42:40] pressure
[1:42:45] even if the doctor might say something
[1:42:47] you know this thing is wrong with you
[1:42:48] that his diagnosis but sometimes why
[1:42:51] make you surprise
[1:42:53] why make you when the doctor said you
[1:42:55] are surprised because you are not
[1:42:57] depressed you are now under the banish
[1:43:00] of sickness
[1:43:01] you feel better you even suffering
[1:43:03] really really I get blood pressure
[1:43:05] really sure
[1:43:08] God
[1:43:10] he's a good God
[1:43:12] he take care of his children
[1:43:19] if you Worship the Lord he will take
[1:43:21] care of you
[1:43:28] they didn't they didn't even know what
[1:43:31] sickness is was they didn't even know
[1:43:34] what o h was
[1:43:36] they didn't even know what being hurt
[1:43:42] they couldn't be hurt
[1:43:44] praise the Lord
[1:43:46] amen
[1:43:48] we are in a falling body there are
[1:43:50] things that hurt us things people say
[1:43:52] things people do hurt us
[1:43:55] but that's why the Holy Ghost is for
[1:43:57] it rises us above the heart
[1:44:03] it comes down and bring you above that
[1:44:05] hurt
[1:44:08] because brother Branham says God wants
[1:44:10] his children to be happy
[1:44:12] he did not say God want his children to
[1:44:15] have everything no God wants his
[1:44:17] children to be happy
[1:44:23] and we can be happy
[1:44:26] are being contained
[1:44:29] we can be happy by knowing that God is
[1:44:33] with us
[1:44:34] the shout of the king
[1:44:37] is in my camp
[1:44:39] praise the Lord the shout of the king is
[1:44:42] in
[1:44:45] amen
[1:44:55] do you know how many people that are
[1:44:57] enslaved
[1:44:58] by a hurt from childhood
[1:45:02] and they are even ready to carry down
[1:45:04] her down to the Grave
[1:45:09] they have gone to counseling and
[1:45:11] counseling and they can just not get
[1:45:13] away they are enslaved to that heart
[1:45:23] he says
[1:45:26] they were in the presence of the
[1:45:28] omnipotent power of God
[1:45:31] which led them
[1:45:35] which held them
[1:45:37] in control praise the Lord
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:41] which held them in control and guide
[1:45:44] them by his spirit
[1:45:46] there was nothing
[1:45:52] amen nothing
[1:45:58] praise the Lord
[1:46:00] oh how it's easy
[1:46:02] for us to just go into them into the
[1:46:05] world of imagination
[1:46:07] and think about them
[1:46:09] but what the prophet is trying to make
[1:46:10] us to realize that same God is here for
[1:46:13] us today
[1:46:15] amen that same God is here with us today
[1:46:24] praise the Lord
[1:46:30] even as a little group of people in this
[1:46:32] place
[1:46:38] to realize that you know that that I
[1:46:40] mean this is the place that the Lord has
[1:46:43] provided for us for church and and we
[1:46:45] come here for service Wednesday night
[1:46:47] and Sunday
[1:46:51] and maybe the closest person that live
[1:46:53] yet is about 20 minutes away from church
[1:46:57] but the Lord has been good to us
[1:47:01] praise the Lord
[1:47:03] he has been good to us
[1:47:06] amen
[1:47:10] I came by one day after after work and
[1:47:13] uh I just drive by like I always do
[1:47:17] came in
[1:47:19] what whatever it was uh
[1:47:24] you know the the door was not lined
[1:47:27] properly
[1:47:28] the lock was on the outside
[1:47:31] and uh
[1:47:33] and I just said Lord you you're being so
[1:47:35] good to us
[1:47:37] he watched over us while we are in
[1:47:39] church
[1:47:41] praise the Lord the very day that that
[1:47:43] young man that young man was shot by
[1:47:45] that police woman we were right here in
[1:47:48] church that very day there was a youth
[1:47:50] meeting right here when when the riot
[1:47:53] was going on
[1:47:54] and we did not know about it until
[1:47:57] everybody got home
[1:48:05] praise the Lord
[1:48:16] are we together let me just sweep over a
[1:48:19] little bit here uh it's 11 minutes after
[1:48:22] nine
[1:48:24] I think if I leave you right here I can
[1:48:26] have something else to preach on
[1:48:29] but then if I go a little bit
[1:48:32] I might give you something to think
[1:48:34] about
[1:48:37] praise the Lord
[1:48:39] if I stop right here I may have
[1:48:40] something to preach on
[1:48:42] but if I go a little bit I might I might
[1:48:44] give you something to think about
[1:48:46] praise the Lord
[1:48:47] amen the Lord has been good to us you
[1:48:49] believe that
[1:48:51] amen
[1:48:54] so that's that's that's what I want I
[1:48:55] want to bring to us tonight I wanted to
[1:48:57] go into a thought you know brother
[1:48:59] Branham said it is it's something that
[1:49:01] is common we have heard it over and over
[1:49:04] the Gentile Age begin with an image
[1:49:07] worship brother Brandon said it where I
[1:49:10] Usher out with the same
[1:49:12] okay I won't go the code is right here
[1:49:14] before me but what I wanted to to to
[1:49:17] make you to realize is that uh the
[1:49:21] prophet talked about how the age the
[1:49:23] Gentile dispensation on a dying year
[1:49:25] when when God gave Daniel that that
[1:49:27] Vision uh interpreting Nebuchadnezzar
[1:49:31] dream and it was all about the gentai
[1:49:33] kingdom and and he says the Gentile age
[1:49:36] was going to be issued in by an image
[1:49:39] worship amen he says it will go out the
[1:49:42] same we realize it's around us amen is
[1:49:45] around us most especially we're uh uh
[1:49:48] there's a big deity thing going on about
[1:49:51] uh you know when but thank God we are
[1:49:53] above that amen I'm not going to blow
[1:49:55] trumpet on that tonight I want to get us
[1:49:57] to the place where we can bring worship
[1:49:59] to God praise the Lord now so but what I
[1:50:02] want to I want you to realize is that in
[1:50:06] the time of Daniel
[1:50:08] in the time of Daniel
[1:50:10] they were there were there were two
[1:50:12] things that came on the scene and all of
[1:50:15] these things was around worship
[1:50:17] now you have to realize that Daniel as a
[1:50:21] prophet
[1:50:23] is a beautiful in a way the Holy Spirit
[1:50:25] do things just for us to be able to
[1:50:28] teach us lesson down here hard his trial
[1:50:34] of the Lion's Den
[1:50:37] amen
[1:50:38] I mentioned that on the on uh uh on
[1:50:42] Sunday
[1:50:43] how God allowed those Hebrew boys and
[1:50:47] Hebrew people to go into into Babylon
[1:50:51] because he wanted to lift his name
[1:50:54] he wanted to be magnified
[1:50:57] amen
[1:50:59] he wanted for the whole of Babylon
[1:51:01] because Babylon was ruling the word at
[1:51:04] that time he wanted for the whole of
[1:51:06] Babylon the Bible says every knee will
[1:51:09] burn in every tongue will confess
[1:51:13] that Jesus is Lord the Bible says every
[1:51:17] it means every
[1:51:22] praise the Lord some may not do it in
[1:51:25] their lifetime they would do it in the
[1:51:27] region of the Lost
[1:51:31] because when they get down there in the
[1:51:33] region of the laws and realize
[1:51:41] So Daniel was was was tempted
[1:51:46] that nobody should worship and the Bible
[1:51:49] says he will open he opened his curtains
[1:51:53] he had disciplined himself to lifting up
[1:51:56] his hands to the Lord three times a day
[1:51:59] and he was that going to be intimidated
[1:52:01] by the King's Command
[1:52:05] praise the Lord now what I want you to
[1:52:08] wash here is that if we take it in the
[1:52:12] context of the prophet and the elect
[1:52:14] now the prophet had to make a stand
[1:52:19] he had to stand against the religious
[1:52:23] authority of that day
[1:52:26] Daniel took a stand
[1:52:28] and it was done here alone Daniel was
[1:52:31] not praying alone but when it came to
[1:52:33] that time it was Daniel alone that went
[1:52:36] down into the lion's den
[1:52:42] praise the Lord
[1:52:44] and when the law will deliver him the
[1:52:47] king now will also now make an image
[1:52:52] yeah in the name of a holy man
[1:52:57] all he did was he just changed the name
[1:53:00] of the god
[1:53:02] but if God was still an idol
[1:53:05] yeah
[1:53:06] praise the Lord maybe if he changed the
[1:53:09] name of the God and he can put a message
[1:53:11] terminology to it
[1:53:14] he would get the message people to
[1:53:16] worship it yeah
[1:53:19] praise the Lord are we together
[1:53:21] but what also I want you to realize is
[1:53:24] that when it came to worshiping the
[1:53:26] image Daniel was not dead Daniel was
[1:53:29] alive yeah
[1:53:31] he was not dead he was alive
[1:53:34] but this time the Bible only speaks of
[1:53:38] shadra Misha and Abednego
[1:53:42] did that means that Daniel bow down to
[1:53:44] the image no
[1:53:47] but you see the principle the way the
[1:53:49] Bible will structure things is to re is
[1:53:52] to make us to realize there is a time
[1:53:55] where the messenger the leader he will
[1:53:58] go through his time of trial and tests
[1:54:01] and if he can stand and create a way
[1:54:05] that goes over to the elect
[1:54:07] sure
[1:54:10] yeah
[1:54:12] are we together
[1:54:16] praise the Lord
[1:54:18] oh I don't believe that that Daniel
[1:54:20] worshiped that image
[1:54:22] no
[1:54:25] even though the image was named back to
[1:54:28] shelter that was that was the name that
[1:54:30] the king gave to Daniel
[1:54:32] and that was what he he named the image
[1:54:34] and asked everybody should worship it
[1:54:38] and do you realize
[1:54:40] that some Jews that were born in the
[1:54:42] Trap of Levi worship that image
[1:54:46] Young
[1:54:48] Jews that were born in in in in in in in
[1:54:51] in the levitical household
[1:54:58] but there were few Elitch
[1:55:01] praise the Lord
[1:55:03] there were few Elitch
[1:55:08] do you know how tempting it is
[1:55:11] to thank chedra
[1:55:14] is not here with us
[1:55:18] Daniel is not here
[1:55:20] praise the Lord
[1:55:22] I mean yeah we can
[1:55:24] I mean whatever he's doing that is they
[1:55:26] are not persecuting we can do the same
[1:55:35] praise the Lord
[1:55:37] but the Bible says they were determined
[1:55:42] to give worship
[1:55:47] to only one God
[1:55:49] and God will use that
[1:55:53] God used what done your debt
[1:55:56] and it influenced the king
[1:55:58] to know that there is only one God
[1:56:01] but it still did not change the hearts
[1:56:04] of the people
[1:56:05] praise the Lord
[1:56:08] chadra Mission and Abednego was put
[1:56:10] through their trial
[1:56:15] God will use that
[1:56:18] so you see it it is now only what the
[1:56:21] messenger did
[1:56:22] that God used to vindicate himself in
[1:56:25] this age
[1:56:27] God is also using what you and myself
[1:56:30] would do they stand that we will take at
[1:56:32] work they said we would take in our
[1:56:35] neighborhood
[1:56:37] the same we would take in our dress code
[1:56:42] praise the Lord
[1:56:45] sometimes we want to disguise ourselves
[1:56:47] I mean so we can treat ourselves anyway
[1:56:49] so people can know that we are Christian
[1:56:59] God is using the elite of this age
[1:57:05] to vindicate his word
[1:57:09] amen so sure there is still a living God
[1:57:12] that can keep young people
[1:57:15] from sin they can keep them from this
[1:57:17] present word they receive a living God
[1:57:20] that can keep our homes and keep our
[1:57:23] marriages there is still a living God
[1:57:30] praise the Lord
[1:57:32] we might not be able to carry everybody
[1:57:33] to Sabine okay
[1:57:36] but you can bring them to your home
[1:57:40] and let them see the decency that is in
[1:57:42] the home let us see the harmony that is
[1:57:44] in the home
[1:58:03] I said we're going to give you something
[1:58:04] to think about tonight
[1:58:07] the Lord bless you the musicians can
[1:58:09] come
[1:58:12] the prophet his time
[1:58:16] and he said in a message of uh the
[1:58:19] attraction on the mountain he says the
[1:58:20] prophecy has changed
[1:58:23] he said the attraction has changed
[1:58:27] from the prophet
[1:58:28] to his prophecy
[1:58:31] and his prophecy
[1:58:38] this is the people that he have called
[1:58:40] he have come to call to truth worship
[1:58:44] we can say tonight that we have seen his
[1:58:47] star
[1:58:48] we have seen his time we have identified
[1:58:51] him in those seven stars in the hands of
[1:58:54] Jesus Christ we have seen his time
[1:58:59] foreign
[1:59:08] this is our day
[1:59:11] are we going to bow down to
[1:59:13] to the pressure of the age
[1:59:16] are we going to give in

[1:59:26] you want to use your hands you want to
[1:59:29] use your appearance you want to use your
[1:59:32] dress code he wants to use the way you
[1:59:34] speak
[1:59:37] the Lord that is seen in your life the
[1:59:39] love that is seen in your home the way
[1:59:41] you relate to your children
[1:59:43] that's what God wants to use in this age
[1:59:46] to vindicate that he's still a living
[1:59:48] God
