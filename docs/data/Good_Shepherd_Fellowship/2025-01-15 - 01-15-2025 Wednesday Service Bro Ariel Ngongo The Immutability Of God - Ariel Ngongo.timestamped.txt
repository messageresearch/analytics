[15:53] Lord or he's trying to reach out of

[15:58] Ascension so we were just talking about
[16:00] that and and uh really having a good
[16:02] time of uh devotion and fellowship with
[16:05] the family and earlier before before we
[16:08] started praying she went down to to get
[16:12] one one of redeemed uh uh pulled over
[16:14] ready so as she uh as we got to pray and
[16:21] uh I was I just I just got up you know
[16:23] we we meet in a little a little space
[16:26] between our room and we sit on on the
[16:29] floor together uh and then read uh so I
[16:33] just woke up and I turned in the room to
[16:35] go and get myself ready quickly and uh
[16:40] uh and then she was she was about
[16:43] getting from the stairs now she was
[16:44] sitting on the it's a I think it's a
[16:47] four staircase to to our room so she was
[16:50] sitting on the tear one as soon as she
[16:53] woke up she was trying to get up and her
[16:56] knees just went like this so she went

[17:05] the
[17:06] floor redeem was sitting uh little
[17:10] redeem was sitting right on the stairs
[17:11] there with her so then I hear the
[17:13] children stream you know so I've just
[17:16] entered the room so I turned back and
[17:19] then I saw her on the floor so I told
[17:21] the girls go in your room and then I
[17:23] went uh I went down to
[17:26] her and uh I help her to sit and then
[17:31] remove her legs just have her legs to
[17:34] straighten out and I I spoke to her a
[17:37] little bit but just when she fell when I
[17:40] when I got over her I just I just he her
[17:43] saying Lord is this my time that's what
[17:46] I heard her saying you know and then
[17:49] from right there she when she said Lord

[18:17] her entire upper body was not moving she
[18:20] didn't have no movement in the upper
[18:23] body and also her legs were not moving
[18:26] she so she told me I'm not feeling my
[18:28] legs so I said okay just sit there like

[18:34] and myself said we pray and then
[18:39] uh I put her I put her her hands around
[18:43] my shoulder and then I took her from the
[18:45] back uh grab her with her legs and I I
[18:49] pick her up I managed to do that so I
[18:52] pick her up straight into our room and
[18:56] uh uh we we we had now put our bed up
[19:00] here like I told you we stay moving so
[19:03] our mattress was on the floor so I lay
[19:05] her on the bed just so her legs would be
[19:07] straight you know so while she were
[19:09] laying on the bed I put a pillow you
[19:12] know on her head and right I heard I
[19:15] heard a prayer calling her mother you
[19:18] know and and her mom says tell tell Papa
[19:21] to call call the uh the ambulance so
[19:26] then I did you know I I called and and
[19:30] they came but she was she was very
[19:32] alight you know she was not crying she
[19:35] was not she was not in pains it's just
[19:38] that she was not feeling no movement in
[19:40] her in her feet and even her hands and
[19:44] uh so we they took her to the
[19:48] hospital and uh
[19:52] uh the kids went to
[19:54] school and then uh you know I got my
[19:57] wife and we went over
[20:00] to to the
[20:02] hospital to see her then uh we rush her
[20:05] to the
[20:06] emergency and after the while the
[20:08] doctors came the nurse that was treating
[20:10] her you know well I mean she will answer
[20:13] any question they will ask her I mean
[20:15] she was very Alik answer every question
[20:19] and uh they couldn't feed there was no
[20:21] fever you know there was no pain to say
[20:25] this place is aching me so only beside
[20:28] the bum she had on her face so the nurse
[20:31] wanted for her to stand up and see if
[20:33] they would do a little walk back and
[20:35] forth with her and then they were going
[20:37] to send her
[20:39] home so when uh
[20:43] uh my wife and the nurse tried to have
[20:45] her to
[20:47] stand she's I mean they had her on her
[20:51] feet but there was just no balance she
[20:54] did not have no balance so she couldn't
[20:56] stand and uh so the nurse said said no
[20:59] no no no let's put her back on the bed I
[21:01] would tell the you know the doctor that
[21:04] she's now moving and then they sent her
[21:06] for the CD scan she went for the CD scan
[21:09] it came out
[21:11] good and so they were they were actually
[21:14] concerned what is causing the problem so
[21:16] they wanted to check for the if she had
[21:18] any kind of a bleeding in her head and
[21:21] so they did an MRI now they were trying
[21:24] to look at her head you know the brain
[21:26] area and all of that but the
[21:29] mrii pick
[21:31] up a picture at the back of her
[21:35] neck and then uh the M show she didn't
[21:39] have no bleeding but then the the doctor
[21:41] was able to see that there was a a
[21:45] dislocated dicks in the back of her neck
[21:48] that was lying on her spine but the
[21:51] picture was not very clear so he ordered
[21:54] a second
[21:56] MRI and then uh that MRI fully re
[22:00] revealed that she had three dicks lying
[22:03] on her spine and then one of them one of
[22:07] them
[22:09] broke and he was actually surprised he
[22:13] said it's a miracle that she's not
[22:15] paralyzed you know so they order an
[22:18] immediate
[22:19] surgery uh because if she would not do
[22:22] the surgery she would not she would not
[22:25] be able to use use her legs or her arms
[22:28] anymore so they ordered an immediate
[22:31] surgery so we we decided that yeah she
[22:36] should do the
[22:37] surgery and uh they thought they would
[22:40] have done it yesterday but uh finally
[22:43] the surgery was done today and uh and
[22:47] the doctor say she's the surgery went
[22:50] fine and she's even moving her hand so
[22:54] we want to thank the Lord for that amen
[22:57] we want to thank the Lord for that I I
[22:59] think there a miracle that's a miracle
[23:02] in itself amen there a miracle in
[23:06] itself that is a miracle in itself so we
[23:10] thank the Lord we thank the Lord uh uh
[23:14] uh
[23:17] We've
[23:19] [Music]
[23:20] uh so that's that's the report on the
[23:24] the prayer need that we send
[23:26] you and uh
[23:29] uh I was in the midst of that because
[23:31] just uh uh on the weekend I got a got a
[23:37] uh a text report of one of my brother in
[23:41] Long
[23:42] Island uh if you remember a couple of
[23:45] years back when my older brother uh R re
[23:49] was here we gave you a prayer request of
[23:52] one of our brothers that was that was in
[23:55] uh in the hospital needing the liver
[23:57] transplant
[23:59] as the Lord would bless him he had the
[24:01] liver transplant everything went
[24:04] well but suddenly this weekend he took
[24:07] an
[24:08] infection he took an
[24:10] infection and uh so we were dealing with
[24:13] that but just last
[24:16] night uh the the
[24:19] infection went through his body and he
[24:23] passed away last night so I mean the
[24:27] hold of uh since Monday I just been on a
[24:31] tremendous phone call back and forth
[24:34] with Grandma Bear
[24:36] situation uh sister Elizabeth situation
[24:39] and then and also my
[24:41] brother but the Lord is faithful the
[24:44] Lord is faithful you know at the time we
[24:48] want to see him two years ago we really
[24:51] thought that was when he was ging
[24:53] because when we went to the hospital he
[24:55] was not
[24:56] responding he was he was on un conscious
[24:59] we really thought that he was going but
[25:01] the Lord allowed him to have this
[25:03] surgery which of course came as a
[25:05] miracle for him you know he he did not
[25:09] know the donor the donor only heard
[25:11] about his situation no uh uh the donor
[25:15] relative heard about his situation and
[25:18] decided that they should give their
[25:19] relative labor to him and it came as a
[25:22] perfect match you know so it was really
[25:26] a miracle for us but it pleased the Lord
[25:30] that he will spend a little time with
[25:32] his wife and children and then uh the
[25:35] Lord call him home last night he was a
[25:38] young Baptist preacher also so we want
[25:41] to remember his wife Mar and his two
[25:44] girls I want to pray that the Lord would
[25:47] just strengthen them I know it's so hard
[25:50] for the wife because you know she felt
[25:53] like she lost her husband two years
[25:55] ago and uh the lord gave him back to H
[25:59] and now finally he had to go to be with

[57:02] open the word with
[57:04] me uh I'll
[57:07] read
[57:09] uh in the book of Hebrew chapter
[57:17] 138 Hebrew 138
[57:26] Hebrews
[57:34] 138 uh it's a short reading very
[57:37] familiar
[57:39] scripture it says Jesus
[57:43] Christ the same
[57:45] yesterday and today and forever you may
[57:50] be seated
[57:56] and uh we're just going to have a word
[57:57] of
[57:59] prayer Heavenly
[58:01] Father we stand before you tonight with
[58:05] reverence in our
[58:06] heart because we know that you are
[58:09] already here
[58:11] father Lord we believe in our heart that
[58:15] you are the one who made the
[58:18] promise and none of your promises will
[58:22] fail that's why we are here tonight oh
[58:25] God Believing on what you have
[58:27] promised that whatever we will ask in
[58:30] your name it shall be given unto
[58:32] us father we just give ourself into your
[58:36] hands father now Lord there is no merit
[58:39] in US Lord you know our mistakes you
[58:42] know our ups and down you know our
[58:44] lackings you know our Uprising our down
[58:47] falling Lord we just ask oh God may you
[58:50] just come and take control over the
[58:52] service from the beginning to the end
[58:54] father take the men out of the way Lord
[58:56] you know there's nothing in me father
[58:59] but I Rely myself fully on you Lord use
[59:02] this vessel use this body Lord God that
[59:04] it can be of a blessing to your people
[59:07] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[59:09] amen God bless
[59:12] you God bless
[59:14] you you know there's no greater gift
[59:17] than somebody to tell you God bless you
[59:20] you know sometime if somebody gives you
[59:22] the money you would rather get the money
[59:24] than the blessing but this blessing is
[59:25] great than the money amen so we just
[59:30] read there in Hebrew
[59:33] 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[59:36] today and
[59:37] forever today if you notice I'll be very
[59:40] calm and I'm not going to do a lot of
[59:42] movement by God's grace I just want to
[59:44] take a few verses here and maybe a few
[59:47] quote that I will read so that it can be
[59:49] of a blessing to you tonight I want to
[59:52] speak on the imitability of God
[59:56] the imitability in other word the
[59:58] unchangeableness of God God does not
[1:00:01] change amen if there's one thing I want
[1:00:04] you to know tonight that God does not
[1:00:07] change yes in the Book of Malachi
[1:00:11] chapter 3 if the sister came projected
[1:00:13] for us I didn't set up my power points
[1:00:15] because everything will be done here no
[1:00:18] preparation whatsoever but I trust in
[1:00:19] God you know there's no ability in men
[1:00:22] there's ability God is able to use the
[1:00:24] vessel so so that whatever you have in
[1:00:27] your heart just ask the Lord you know
[1:00:29] he's here tonight he's able to touch you
[1:00:31] he's able to answer your prayer amen
[1:00:33] he's do is able to do great things in
[1:00:35] our midst how many of us believe that
[1:00:37] now the Bible says in Malachi CH 3 Verse
[1:00:41] 6 the Bible says for I am the Lord and I
[1:00:45] change not amen how many of us believe
[1:00:48] it it says therefore ye son of Jacob are
[1:00:51] not consumed so God there's no ability
[1:00:54] in God to change is not planning
[1:00:58] something or thinking to change his mind
[1:01:02] so when God says something it will stand
[1:01:05] the trials of time so now brother in a
[1:01:08] scripture here I want to read and that
[1:01:10] will be really what I want really to sit
[1:01:12] on upon is in the book of Hebrews
[1:01:14] chapter
[1:01:14] 6 Hebrews chapter 6 verse1
[1:01:18] 17 Hebrews chapter 6:1 17 and I want you
[1:01:22] to pay attention on this ver verse very
[1:01:26] closely here this chapter we will read
[1:01:28] here the Bible says
[1:01:32] wherein God
[1:01:34] willing more abundantly in other word
[1:01:38] God is Desiring more abundantly to share
[1:01:42] unto the HS of the promise are we
[1:01:45] together amen so God want to show his
[1:01:50] desire is to show unto the heads of
[1:01:53] Salvation is not to everybody but to A
[1:01:56] specific group of people are you with me
[1:01:59] so God is willing more abundantly to
[1:02:03] show unto the heads of the promise the
[1:02:07] imitability of his counsel are you are
[1:02:11] are we together so God himself is
[1:02:14] Desiring to show to a specific group of
[1:02:17] people how he is unchanging in his
[1:02:20] purpose or is in Cel is that right
[1:02:22] that's right so it continues per say
[1:02:26] confirm
[1:02:28] it by an oath thereby two imitable
[1:02:33] things in which it was impossible for
[1:02:37] God to lie are we together it says that
[1:02:41] we might have a strong
[1:02:43] consolation so these heads of Salvation
[1:02:46] must have a strong consolation that God
[1:02:49] does not
[1:02:50] change so s when we opening our Bible
[1:02:54] when we reading a scripture
[1:02:56] we have to have the confidence that the
[1:02:58] god that we serving does not change so
[1:03:01] Saint we cannot serve a God that changes
[1:03:04] idea no no no are we together right and
[1:03:07] then let me tell you tonight we're not
[1:03:09] serving that God can say one thing after
[1:03:12] tomorrow he changes his mind he cannot
[1:03:14] do it amen you see where we we Face we
[1:03:18] we basing our faith on WE basing our
[1:03:21] faith on the infallibility of God's word
[1:03:24] is that are we together yeah that we
[1:03:26] might have a strong consolation who have
[1:03:29] fled for Refuge to laid hold upon the
[1:03:32] Hope set before us are we together
[1:03:35] there's one thing that the prophet says
[1:03:37] here in the
[1:03:38] message uh the unchange unchangeable God
[1:03:42] he says there are many things and
[1:03:44] practical practically all thing changes
[1:03:48] time changes people changes weather
[1:03:51] changes Nation changes are we together
[1:03:54] God is the unch
[1:03:57] he does not change he is the same all
[1:04:00] the time are we together in another in
[1:04:03] in the church exposition of the church
[1:04:05] age in the Ephesian Church age brother
[1:04:07] bham says the KE given me of the Lord
[1:04:11] whereby I was able to determine the
[1:04:14] messenger for each age is the a most
[1:04:17] scriptural one it says in fact it might
[1:04:20] be the Keystone of the
[1:04:22] Bible are we together but say says it
[1:04:26] must be the kick Stone of the Bible it
[1:04:28] says it is the Revelation that God never
[1:04:33] changes amen he calls it the keystones
[1:04:37] of the Bible that God cannot change it
[1:04:40] says it is the Revelation that God never
[1:04:43] changed and his ways are as
[1:04:48] unchangeable as he is amen amen amen
[1:04:54] these are powerful things Saints
[1:04:56] so we must be able to know what we
[1:04:59] believe it's not just the fact and say
[1:05:01] okay I'm coming to a next service I have
[1:05:04] this issue I have this problem but I
[1:05:06] must be able to believe that the god
[1:05:08] that I'm serving amen that the god that
[1:05:11] I'm praying to is unchanging in his ways
[1:05:15] right amen that's right oh my amen I I
[1:05:19] want to take it slow because these are
[1:05:21] very
[1:05:22] important last time we spoke about
[1:05:24] Memorial prayer MH so when we are
[1:05:27] praying we must know who we are praying
[1:05:30] to amen it's not just any type of God
[1:05:33] what would be the difference between a
[1:05:34] man that is worshiping the
[1:05:36] son and you that may not know who you
[1:05:39] serving there's no
[1:05:42] difference if you don't know who you
[1:05:44] serving is closely to a person who
[1:05:47] probably worshiped the son he does not
[1:05:49] even know what what he's worshiping
[1:05:51] because whatever is worshiping there's
[1:05:53] nothing in it but you knowing who you
[1:05:55] worshiping gives you the
[1:05:58] power give you the element to get
[1:06:01] something out of that you see God is not
[1:06:04] just an imagination no it's not just a
[1:06:08] thought it's a person amen that's right
[1:06:11] amen you know something that is
[1:06:13] invisible does not mean that it does not
[1:06:15] exist because all things were made by
[1:06:18] the
[1:06:19] invisible everything that you see here
[1:06:21] it was made by the invis so the
[1:06:23] invisible world is stronger than this
[1:06:25] what we see here amen amen you
[1:06:28] understand what I'm saying as we are
[1:06:30] sitting here there are spirits that are
[1:06:32] traveling around this
[1:06:34] building you may not see it it doesn't
[1:06:36] mean that they're not there that's right
[1:06:38] it doesn't mean that they don't exist
[1:06:40] they are here amen so the same as the
[1:06:42] evil spirit are traveling around the wom
[1:06:44] the same God also is traveling Among Us
[1:06:48] that's right that's right are we
[1:06:50] together because Saints let me tell you
[1:06:52] something the same way you should know
[1:06:53] your de the Devil exist you must also
[1:06:56] know your God
[1:06:57] exist because you cannot say oh I
[1:06:59] believe that God exists and you don't
[1:07:01] believe that there's an enemy called
[1:07:02] Satan you must be able to believe that
[1:07:04] oh there's a devil
[1:07:05] somewhere and that devil is against me
[1:07:08] he against my family it's against my
[1:07:11] children is against my church is against
[1:07:13] whoever I
[1:07:15] love so if Satan is against them I must
[1:07:19] go to a power that is greater than Satan
[1:07:22] am amen and that's the reveal word am
[1:07:25] amen that's right are we
[1:07:28] together because remember now we just
[1:07:30] read that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:07:32] yesterday today and forever so if he had
[1:07:34] done anything in the past he will do it
[1:07:37] today the same exact way if you come the
[1:07:41] provided way that the first person went
[1:07:43] through you have the same Faith as a
[1:07:45] person you will receive the same results
[1:07:48] that's right there's not a different the
[1:07:51] result if you came you you come the same
[1:07:54] provided way you receive the same result
[1:07:57] because God does not change if he gave
[1:08:00] to my brother here he more than able to
[1:08:02] give to my sister over there if they
[1:08:03] come the same provided way they
[1:08:05] expecting to receive the same thing are
[1:08:08] we together amen and brother calls it
[1:08:13] the Keystone of the B is a revelation
[1:08:15] that God never changes are we
[1:08:18] together brother bam says something in
[1:08:20] go awake Jesus he says his first
[1:08:23] decision is his only
[1:08:27] decision Oh Glory to God are we
[1:08:32] together it says his first decision his
[1:08:35] his only decision because he infinite
[1:08:39] amen are we together amen and to be
[1:08:42] infinite that's perfect times perfect
[1:08:45] plus
[1:08:47] perfect can I repeat it again he says
[1:08:50] his first decision is the only decision
[1:08:54] because is infinite and to be infinite
[1:08:57] that's perfect time perfect plus perfect
[1:09:02] and perfect is in infinite he knew all
[1:09:06] things from the beginning right he never
[1:09:09] had to take a word back so Saints let me
[1:09:13] just stop a little bit here if I have
[1:09:15] the ability to see the end I pronounce
[1:09:18] the word here I cannot change it because
[1:09:20] I know what would happen at the
[1:09:23] end so when God speaks is infinite means
[1:09:26] he sees already the End Amen so when God
[1:09:30] speaks he says I am the Lord that Health
[1:09:33] thee amen he already saw the sickness
[1:09:35] that will come probably 400 years amen
[1:09:39] amen 4,000 years in the future amen so
[1:09:42] when he giv the promise he knows that
[1:09:44] there's going to be people that will
[1:09:45] come after amen that's right praise the
[1:09:48] Lord they will claim that blessing am
[1:09:51] and they will receive the
[1:09:52] healing that scripture has been lay in
[1:09:54] the Bible for years and
[1:09:56] years and every man and woman that came
[1:09:59] the provided way received something out
[1:10:01] of it am amen you understand what I'm
[1:10:04] saying so if it happened then is able to
[1:10:08] do it now amen amen Oh Glory to
[1:10:11] God he continues it says he never had to
[1:10:15] take a word back he never had to improve
[1:10:19] because his first decision is the only
[1:10:22] decision can can ever be be made
[1:10:25] he does not learn
[1:10:28] more do you understand what I'm saying
[1:10:31] he does not learn more get smarter as we
[1:10:35] claim we do but he was perfect to begin
[1:10:39] with
[1:10:41] Amen Let Let me just break this a little
[1:10:43] bit you know during the pandemic there's
[1:10:46] a lot of things that have changed how
[1:10:47] many have been affected by it you see
[1:10:50] many people got sick maybe their health
[1:10:52] got really in a bad shape right after
[1:10:54] that and many of us change this is a
[1:10:58] fact you may not see it but in your life
[1:10:59] something
[1:11:00] change maybe people have more fear now
[1:11:03] than then because of the pandemic
[1:11:06] because we change because of the
[1:11:09] environment politics change people
[1:11:13] change but there's one person that does
[1:11:16] not change and that's the person I need
[1:11:19] to trust fully amen amen glory oh my
[1:11:23] goodness amen now we see the word
[1:11:27] here imitability of his counil in other
[1:11:31] word the counil of God is his
[1:11:35] purpose you know it can be considered as
[1:11:37] his purpose or his word because
[1:11:40] everything is before even the beginning
[1:11:43] it was a thought are we together before
[1:11:46] we hear what it says the word it was a
[1:11:49] thought first so God it was Elohim
[1:11:52] living by himself in he he has he had
[1:11:57] attributes he had thoughts so he had
[1:12:01] everything already in his mind but now
[1:12:05] in order for you to know him he might
[1:12:08] Express his thought or let me just stop
[1:12:11] a little bit here if I'm thinking about
[1:12:14] something you met me for the first time
[1:12:15] you would not know who I am is that
[1:12:17] correct right the only time you will
[1:12:20] know me is when I open my mouth and say
[1:12:22] something you would say oh this brother
[1:12:24] has an accent this person maybe is from
[1:12:27] this country or whatever right based on
[1:12:29] what came out of my mouth so God was not
[1:12:31] known when he was yet to talk when
[1:12:33] everything was in his thought or when he
[1:12:35] was alone but he had desire to express
[1:12:39] himself he wanted to get everything that
[1:12:41] was in his mind out are we together so
[1:12:45] when God speak the word the word is the
[1:12:48] thought
[1:12:50] Express right are we together that's
[1:12:53] what brother says the word word is the
[1:12:56] thought that has been expressed so when
[1:12:58] the word comes out he gives the
[1:13:00] description of who the person
[1:13:02] is are we together because you will
[1:13:05] never know God unless he
[1:13:07] spoke that's why even when he gave the
[1:13:10] Commandment he was not just do and don't
[1:13:12] he was expressing his desire right
[1:13:14] that's
[1:13:15] right that's why brother brother one has
[1:13:17] been preaching about the you know has
[1:13:19] been talking about it God want to be
[1:13:21] known the only way he you would know
[1:13:24] that he doesn't like this he likes this
[1:13:25] is when I express
[1:13:28] myself are we
[1:13:30] together and that God never change now
[1:13:35] it
[1:13:36] says God want to show and reveal it says
[1:13:39] he calls it the Keystone of the Bible
[1:13:41] it's the Revelation that God never
[1:13:43] changed and that his way are unchanging
[1:13:46] as he is now what is a
[1:13:49] revelation a revelation is the
[1:13:53] unveiling you know to reveal yourself is
[1:13:56] to unveil yourself to uncover yourself
[1:13:58] is that correct no something that is
[1:14:02] once uh before I go further sister can
[1:14:05] you give me uh this Deuteronomy chapter
[1:14:08] 20 29 verse 29 and as I'm speaking I
[1:14:12] think there's there's something that is
[1:14:13] there that is very
[1:14:14] important now the unveiling the
[1:14:17] uncovering the revealing of what was
[1:14:20] previously hidden yeah so once that
[1:14:23] element it is is the thought of God is
[1:14:26] hidden it's a secret you don't know
[1:14:28] about it so when God does not express
[1:14:31] himself it's just a thought and you
[1:14:34] don't know it God only has is sitting by
[1:14:36] himself as self-existent one with all
[1:14:38] his thought together are we together so
[1:14:42] s you give me Deuteronomy chapter okay
[1:14:45] good it's God is watch this what the
[1:14:48] Bible say here it says the secret things
[1:14:52] right let let's read it together right
[1:14:55] right the secret things belong unto the
[1:14:58] Lord Our God but those things which are
[1:15:04] revealed belong unto us and unto our
[1:15:08] children forever that we may do all the
[1:15:12] word of this law are we together right
[1:15:15] so if a
[1:15:17] secret it is in the mind of God it do
[1:15:20] doesn't belong to us because we don't
[1:15:21] know about it but once it revealed is
[1:15:25] thought it belongs to you and your
[1:15:29] family that's right are we together so
[1:15:33] as long as God has everything in his
[1:15:35] mind that's him he belongs to him I
[1:15:37] don't know about it because if God does
[1:15:40] not want me to do something he kept it
[1:15:42] in his mind I would not
[1:15:44] know the only time I have to follow to
[1:15:48] take heed of it is when he speaks when
[1:15:50] he reveals it amen amen now the
[1:15:53] following chapter
[1:15:55] in uh Deuteronomy chapter 30 it's not
[1:15:57] part of my notes right so we can't go
[1:16:01] Deuteronomy chapter
[1:16:03] 30 uh 30 verse 11 there is something
[1:16:07] that is beautiful
[1:16:09] there
[1:16:10] uh Deuteronomy
[1:16:13] chapter
[1:16:15] 30 I never walked this way before so I
[1:16:19] trust that the Lord will be able to help
[1:16:20] us are we together you love the Lord
[1:16:24] amen it says for this commandment which
[1:16:27] I command thee this day it is not
[1:16:32] hidden from
[1:16:34] thee neither is it is is it what far off
[1:16:39] we are we together yeah the next the
[1:16:40] following verse it is not in
[1:16:45] heaven you see now whatever was a secret
[1:16:49] is no longer in heaven okay that thou
[1:16:53] should say who shall go up for us to
[1:16:57] heaven and bring it down unto us that we
[1:17:00] may hear it and do
[1:17:02] it let's continue
[1:17:04] again neither it it is beyond the sea
[1:17:09] that thou should say who shall go over
[1:17:12] the sea for us and bring it unto us that
[1:17:15] we may hear it and do
[1:17:17] it watch what it says but the word
[1:17:23] is very nice unto thee in thy
[1:17:27] mouth and in thy heart that thou may do
[1:17:32] it right amen that's right you see now
[1:17:36] the word the thoughts of God his purpose
[1:17:40] is no longer in
[1:17:42] heaven his thought has been
[1:17:44] expressed so for you to receive
[1:17:47] something you must get in contact with
[1:17:49] his purpose because he has been revealed
[1:17:52] it belongs to you and your family
[1:17:55] amen thank you Lord amen amen is God a
[1:18:00] Healer
[1:18:01] tonight oh so the fact that you know it
[1:18:05] is no longer his
[1:18:06] thought he belongs to
[1:18:08] you right oh glory to God are we
[1:18:16] together so why are you not
[1:18:20] healed because brother preach the
[1:18:22] message why it says why is the uh I
[1:18:26] can't remember exactly what it said um I
[1:18:30] think it's in the book uh you know why
[1:18:32] the my children are not here why the you
[1:18:34] know uh he was asking the question
[1:18:37] why but if God Is A Healer is thought
[1:18:41] has been expressed but why are we not
[1:18:45] healed why are we not delivered
[1:18:49] amen why are we not changing amen amen
[1:18:53] does it mean that God Chang his mind no
[1:18:55] no is not a man to
[1:18:59] change Oh Glory to God are we
[1:19:03] together let let's let's look at Isaiah
[1:19:06] Isaiah
[1:19:07] 53 let me let me just go there for for
[1:19:10] for few minutes Isaiah chapter
[1:19:13] 535 I'm checking my
[1:19:16] time
[1:19:21] now it says
[1:19:23] here but he was
[1:19:26] wounded for our
[1:19:28] transgression he was bruised for our
[1:19:31] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:19:35] was upon him and with his stripe we were
[1:19:39] healed are we together right now in the
[1:19:43] healing the word healing there's a full
[1:19:45] package there it's not just the healing
[1:19:48] of your
[1:19:50] body that's right he never say here it's
[1:19:53] the healing of your body alone
[1:19:55] that's right because a man has three
[1:19:58] parts the man a human being has a soul a
[1:20:03] spirit and a body body right because
[1:20:06] it's the same exact same thing as the
[1:20:08] Tabernacle the Tabernacle had three
[1:20:10] parts the AR called The Holy place and
[1:20:12] the holies of holies it was just you
[1:20:15] know Moses built the Tabernacle in the
[1:20:17] pattern of what he saw in heaven but
[1:20:19] actually he was talking about a man
[1:20:21] because God does not live in in a temple
[1:20:23] made of men hands the hands of men is
[1:20:27] made out of when God takes a body a
[1:20:30] human being that's God's Temple having
[1:20:33] those three parts that's right amen so
[1:20:36] this healing here is the healing of your
[1:20:39] body is the healing of your soul it's
[1:20:42] the healing of your spirit all of it is
[1:20:45] a full package under the promise that's
[1:20:48] right
[1:20:49] amen that's right amen sometime it's
[1:20:52] easy to say Lord I need the healing of
[1:20:54] my body what about your
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:20:57] soul which is more important than your
[1:21:00] body amen amen amen amen because there
[1:21:04] is a world Beyond this
[1:21:09] flesh that's why Saint we need to give
[1:21:12] more amen amen to what is inside more
[1:21:15] than what we can have here
[1:21:18] amen the soul the salvation of the Soul
[1:21:23] by the feeling of the BM of the Holy
[1:21:25] Ghost that's right because that's where
[1:21:28] God
[1:21:29] lives God does not live in this thing in
[1:21:32] this thing this is a 16 element coming
[1:21:35] from
[1:21:37] dust sometime we focus more God if you
[1:21:40] heal me in my body some what about the
[1:21:42] soul God can heal you though because he
[1:21:44] gave a promise he will heal your body
[1:21:47] because that's his reputation on the
[1:21:49] line if you believe you receive it amen
[1:21:52] amen but if you can't receive for the
[1:21:54] the the the healing of your body what
[1:21:57] about your
[1:21:58] soul I will drop in few minutes here in
[1:22:00] our spirit because we need the healing
[1:22:01] of the spirit amen
[1:22:05] right how many of us need the healing of
[1:22:08] the spirit amen amen amen you know our
[1:22:12] spirit is sometime people don't talk
[1:22:14] about the healing of the spirit more
[1:22:15] more often but Saint what about the hurt
[1:22:18] of our
[1:22:19] life you know maybe we went through
[1:22:22] something when we were young our spirit
[1:22:25] has been affected by it right maybe by
[1:22:28] our
[1:22:29] imagination Maybe by a certain picture
[1:22:32] that you saw it trouble your entire
[1:22:34] entire youth it it changed the pattern
[1:22:36] of your life that's right maybe a word
[1:22:39] that somebody said he affected you what
[1:22:43] about
[1:22:45] memories what what about
[1:22:48] affection all of these things has been
[1:22:51] affected by some even the way we react
[1:22:55] you see somebody say hey God bless you
[1:22:58] you get mad it's not your fault there is
[1:23:01] something that is in your spirit that is
[1:23:03] not right amen amen amen your reaction
[1:23:06] does not just come randomly like this
[1:23:08] it's affected somewhere that's right
[1:23:10] amen so the only way you can get real
[1:23:13] healing you need to yield yourself fully
[1:23:15] to
[1:23:17] God Saints let me tell you something we
[1:23:19] need to be humble before the Lord thank
[1:23:22] you Lord there are things that we may
[1:23:23] not see but it's dwelling inside of our
[1:23:26] life our spirit has been
[1:23:28] affected but we all need that healing it
[1:23:32] might be anxiety it might be fear it
[1:23:35] might be
[1:23:37] complexes oh my goodness you see I'm
[1:23:39] going off my notes now yeah okay it can
[1:23:43] be things in our own spirit that God is
[1:23:45] Desiring to heal because he is
[1:23:50] unchanging right he did it in the past
[1:23:54] he can also do for
[1:23:55] you Church come on we need to wake up

[1:24:20] after 1 Corinthians chapter 1:21 it says
[1:24:22] for after death in the wisdom of of God
[1:24:25] the World by wisdom knew not God he
[1:24:28] pleased God but the foolishness of
[1:24:32] preaching to save them that believe
[1:24:36] salvation is coming from the Greek Soo
[1:24:39] that's right it means
[1:24:42] healing so there salvation people think
[1:24:44] like oh it's just for the soul no it's
[1:24:46] the healing of the Soul amen the man was
[1:24:50] born under he was born in sin his soul

[1:25:38] he want to dwell even if you look at
[1:25:40] this no this is a
[1:25:42] mess but God is looking and say no I
[1:25:45] want that person that's right I want to
[1:25:48] take over the body of that
[1:25:50] person even if they are T even if they
[1:25:53] are d situation but I want Towell in and
[1:25:57] God is fighting his way through he want
[1:25:59] to get into the soul of a man amen
[1:26:02] amen but he wants a heart that would
[1:26:05] believe him amen because he is
[1:26:07] unchanging prise amen that's right are

[1:26:28] change if you trust me I will do
[1:26:31] something for you amen s we're going
[1:26:34] through a lot the people of God are
[1:26:36] dealing with look at what is going on
[1:26:38] around just in one prayer meeting look
[1:26:41] at the list of prayer requests you know
[1:26:44] why the devil is so Furious because he
[1:26:47] knows that his time is
[1:26:49] short so now if it's the end of time
[1:26:52] what am I going to do I will will fight
[1:26:54] my way to and just D everything that I
[1:26:58] would just make try to make them
[1:27:01] uncomfortable because it's time to go
[1:27:03] home
[1:27:04] Saints let me tell you something it's
[1:27:07] time to go home Saints amen amen amen he
[1:27:10] want to show to the heads of
[1:27:13] Salvation the head of the promise the
[1:27:16] imitability of his word Romans chapter
[1:27:19] uh chapter 9 verse
[1:27:22] 6 let me just pull up a little bit here
[1:27:25] to know who are the heir of the promise
[1:27:29] so we'll read a lot of scriptures here
[1:27:30] real quick here who are the heir of the
[1:27:34] promise Romans chapter 9:6 it says not
[1:27:38] as though the word of God has taken no
[1:27:41] effect for they are not all Israel which
[1:27:44] are of Israel we coming from Abraham
[1:27:47] right and then Abraham because Abraham
[1:27:50] gave birth to Isaac is that right but
[1:27:53] Isaac was the son after the Flesh and
[1:27:56] we're about to read
[1:27:57] it uh not as though the word of God has
[1:28:01] taken n effect for they are not all
[1:28:04] Israel which are of Israel neither
[1:28:07] because they are Seed of Abraham are we
[1:28:09] together right are they all children but
[1:28:12] Isaac shall be uh that seed uh be called
[1:28:15] is that right that is they which are the
[1:28:19] children of what the flesh these are not
[1:28:23] the children of God are we to is that
[1:28:25] the
[1:28:26] Bible
[1:28:29] right but the children of the
[1:28:32] promise accounted for the
[1:28:35] seed not Isaac but the the children of
[1:28:39] the promise not the children after the
[1:28:44] flesh are we together right now in the
[1:28:48] book of galatian chapter 3 uh I think
[1:28:52] galatian chapter 3: 16
[1:28:55] you see you remember the scripture we
[1:28:57] just read right because it says but the
[1:29:00] children of the promise accounted for
[1:29:02] what the seed is that right galatian 3:
[1:29:06] 2028 it says there is neither Jew no let
[1:29:11] let me read 3:16 now to Abraham and his
[1:29:16] seed with the promise promises made is
[1:29:19] that right he said not to seeds
[1:29:24] right since there is in plural is that
[1:29:26] right as of many but as
[1:29:30] one to th seed which is Christ am
[1:29:37] amen so the children of the promise must
[1:29:40] come through Christ amen not through
[1:29:44] Isaac we are sitting here because we
[1:29:46] coming the way of the promise praise the
[1:29:49] lord we not come because we're not Jew
[1:29:50] here right is there any Jew in our meet
[1:29:52] here
[1:29:54] but the way we are called children of
[1:29:56] Abraham is through Christ amen it was
[1:29:59] referring to
[1:30:01] Christ Oh Glory to God Amen are we
[1:30:05] together now it says there is neither
[1:30:09] Jew no Greek there there is neither
[1:30:13] bound no free there is neither male nor
[1:30:16] female for We Are All One in Christ
[1:30:21] Jesus amen right yes verse 29 now watch
[1:30:26] this very carefully if ye be right if ye
[1:30:31] be crisis right then are ye Abram what
[1:30:36] seed and a according to what promise not
[1:30:41] according to the flesh according to the
[1:30:43] promise are we together and brother bam
[1:30:47] says this I like this the church
[1:30:49] choosing law for Grace preached in 61
[1:30:54] 15 it says but as it was with Israel
[1:30:56] natural so it is with Israel spiritual
[1:31:00] we are Israelites because we are the
[1:31:03] Seed of Abraham the Israelite is not
[1:31:06] thou which of the
[1:31:08] flesh but thou which is of the
[1:31:11] spirit we being dead in Christ take on
[1:31:16] Abraham's seed and are heads with
[1:31:19] Abraham according to the
[1:31:22] promise are we together
[1:31:24] are we
[1:31:26] together it says Abram was not a Jew
[1:31:29] Abram was a gentile out of the land of
[1:31:31] the CES and the City of or he was
[1:31:34] absolutely a
[1:31:36] gentile that's a
[1:31:39] prophet oh my
[1:31:41] goodness so now it says that you must
[1:31:45] come through the promise to Christ but
[1:31:48] how to be partakers how to be heads of
[1:31:50] the promise through Christ
[1:31:54] by one baptism amen amen the baptism of
[1:31:58] the Holy Ghost AM amen you want to find

[1:33:10] be bound or free and have been made to

[1:33:18] spirit so for the body is not one member

[1:33:28] right so in order to be crisis you must
[1:33:31] be born into that body am and to be born
[1:33:34] into that body is not the natural birth
[1:33:36] like this it's the new birth amen amen

[1:36:47] Earth the way we are and the only the uh
[1:36:51] we only know or can only say that we are
[1:36:56] saved by some Jew Fable called the Bible
[1:37:00] right this man that was with brother bam
[1:37:01] I said sir I don't know how you say that
[1:37:05] but I don't believe it's a Jews Fable I
[1:37:08] said he said well you pray do you pray
[1:37:12] to uh uh uh what do you pray to I ask
[1:37:15] for so and so and so certain things and
[1:37:17] I didn't get it watch what the prophet
[1:37:19] says I said you pray wrong
[1:37:24] he says I pray you know I ask this this
[1:37:26] and I never receive anything but the
[1:37:28] says you pray wrong he says you should
[1:37:31] never pray to change God's
[1:37:34] mind sometime when we pray oh God I'm
[1:37:37] dealing with change this
[1:37:39] situation God's plan is already made he

[1:37:55] he
[1:37:55] says you pray wrong you should never
[1:37:58] pray to change God's mind we should pray
[1:38:02] to change our
[1:38:04] mind God's mind don't need any
[1:38:09] changing God's mind do not need any
[1:38:11] change it does
[1:38:13] not but we are the one that need a
[1:38:15] change amen amen I need a change in my
[1:38:19] life amen you may not see it but deep
[1:38:22] inside I need a change MH amen sometime
[1:38:25] it doesn't mean if I stand here then I'm
[1:38:27] the perfect guy no no I need a change
[1:38:31] you know brother Lafont read a quote
[1:38:33] last time he says it's not the change of
[1:38:35] the ministry it's the change of the
[1:38:37] person amen amen because if you change
[1:38:41] it will change your ministry as well
[1:38:44] amen people will not just see how much
[1:38:47] you can preach people will see a change
[1:38:49] life

[1:39:22] us plenty of the promise prises in the
[1:39:24] Bible it's there for you to take it to
[1:39:27] believe it to take hold of it and that
[1:39:30] will bring that change yes shall we pray
[1:39:34] Heavenly
[1:39:35] Father we come before you tonight
[1:39:38] Lord unworthy that we are
[1:39:42] father Lord we love you we appreciate
[1:39:44] you Lord you are worthy to be praise
[1:39:47] tonight
[1:39:49] father on this Wednesday night Lord God
[1:39:51] you've called us
[1:39:54] to hear a portion of your word father
[1:39:57] you have spoken unto us Lord to know
[1:39:59] that you are unchanging in your ways
[1:40:02] father you have given us plenty of your
[1:40:04] promises they're laying there in the
[1:40:05] Bible but sometime we're so distracted
[1:40:08] to access it Lord but Lord our prayer
[1:40:10] tonight oh God may you open our eyes may
[1:40:13] you open our desires oh god father so
[1:40:15] that we can run to it and possess
[1:40:18] everything that belongs to us Lord many
[1:40:20] of your children oh God are seeking the
[1:40:22] body sick in the spirit oh God even
[1:40:25] their soul father but Lord only you can
[1:40:28] heal father Lord God we pray tonight may
[1:40:30] you come in the power of your
[1:40:32] Resurrection Lord may you change things
[1:40:34] around oh god father in the life of your
[1:40:35] children Lord God May that promise oh
[1:40:38] God these promises that are lay in the
[1:40:39] Bible does not just stay in the page of
[1:40:41] the Bible God but come out of History
[1:40:43] father come out of the page of the Bible
[1:40:45] Lord and have effect in the life of your
[1:40:47] children father we ask these things oh
[1:40:49] God may you just bless oh God your
[1:40:51] people bless your servant oh God bless
[1:40:53] bless the church we give everything to
[1:40:55] you in Jesus Christ name we pray
[1:40:58] amen may God wish you bless you Saints
[1:41:00] God bless
[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:08] you on the same
[1:41:11] God we want to thank the Lord tonight
[1:41:13] and U thank the Lord for helping our
[1:41:17] brother and know
[1:41:19] uh for him to switch over from playing
[1:41:23] to
[1:41:24] preaching but we just appreciate the
[1:41:26] Lord as a wonderful exhortation you know
[1:41:30] when we talk about Divine Healing the
[1:41:33] only thing that receive Divine Healing
[1:41:35] is your
[1:41:37] soul because if if you get sick in the
[1:41:41] body and we pray for you and you get
[1:41:44] sick
[1:41:47] again the it was a
[1:41:50] healing because the healing of the sword
[1:41:52] is
[1:41:54] feminine when a person receive the
[1:41:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:41:59] feminine you don't receive the Holy
[1:42:01] Ghost and then you lose it and then you
[1:42:03] receive it again so what actually
[1:42:07] experience Divine Healing and it's true
[1:42:10] Isaiah chapter
[1:42:12] 53:5 you know uh uh by his tribe you are
[1:42:16] healed actually in the Greek it speaks
[1:42:19] of more than the healing of the body
[1:42:21] that's truth it's speaks of every form
[1:42:24] of healing Jesus died for every form of
[1:42:28] healing every form of
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:33] healing but for the healing of the Soul
[1:42:36] it happens once and that's when the a
[1:42:41] Son of God or a daughter of God received
[1:42:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost even
[1:42:47] within our
[1:42:48] spirit you see the spirit man uh that's
[1:42:52] what Paul says we are Washed by the
[1:42:54] Water of the word because the spirit
[1:42:57] needs constant
[1:42:59] cleansing one of the one of the proof
[1:43:02] there is that you can forget there is no
[1:43:05] way you can do anything to
[1:43:08] forget and that is in your spirit so but
[1:43:12] the spirit need cleansing when we are
[1:43:14] cleansed by the word even though we
[1:43:17] remember but it don't affect
[1:43:21] us like when we go through the
[1:43:25] art so it's that form of healing that we
[1:43:28] get in our spirit every time we are
[1:43:30] cleansed by the word every time the the
[1:43:33] water of the word wash us that's the
[1:43:36] reason why you can leave a habit and go
[1:43:39] back to
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:42] it that's in the spirit
[1:43:46] real you can you can you can get the flu
[1:43:49] and and and you take medication or you
[1:43:52] be prayed for you you get healed and
[1:43:54] then you get sick again so we goes
[1:43:57] through that cycle we experience healing
[1:43:59] in and out but that Divine Healing when
[1:44:04] it when it when it speaks about Divine
[1:44:07] Healing and you see that's the reason
[1:44:09] why brother Brandon identified those
[1:44:11] things in his
[1:44:14] ministry that it was now all about the
[1:44:17] healing of the body that came under his
[1:44:20] first first pH of ministry called the
[1:44:23] first P that was for the healing of the
[1:44:26] body the second P was for the healing of
[1:44:29] the spirit that's the reason why he went
[1:44:31] back and and just like brother ER said I
[1:44:33] can still remember a few days ago it
[1:44:36] even came to my mind I was thinking on
[1:44:38] that I can remember as a child I think I
[1:44:42] was I was maybe about four years old or
[1:44:45] so if I if if if I'm right in my mind
[1:44:48] four or five but I was very little I I
[1:44:52] went to buy
[1:44:53] I went to buy a donut and I was running
[1:44:57] in excitement back home didn't know just
[1:45:01] just like a child running this and a dog
[1:45:04] charged you know ran to me I mean if a a
[1:45:09] a that thing frighten me until till now
[1:45:14] in my in my mind I still re memory and
[1:45:18] that thing affected my spirit
[1:45:24] we had dogs
[1:45:25] home and uh and and I love dogs but I
[1:45:30] mean like somebody that we just that
[1:45:32] that is really into dogs I'm I'm not
[1:45:34] that
[1:45:38] way you see and and and by the grace of
[1:45:41] God you know you hear those things
[1:45:43] brother B and pick them on tape you know
[1:45:45] you were you were you were affected when
[1:45:47] you were small and and right from then
[1:45:50] on you know I I prayed over it you know
[1:45:54] many times and and you know I'm I'm not
[1:45:57] I'm not uh uh in that state of fear
[1:46:00] because brother Bram says that's what
[1:46:02] the dog send if a dog charge after you
[1:46:05] he send
[1:46:06] fear when he back at you because he send
[1:46:09] fear in you and it's a way for the dog
[1:46:12] to defend itself because he send fear in
[1:46:15] you he thinks you're going to attack it
[1:46:18] so it starts to back at you you know and
[1:46:22] uh
[1:46:27] but there are a lot of things lot of
[1:46:31] things there are a lot of things even
[1:46:34] even when you deal with
[1:46:36] children when you yell at children you
[1:46:39] yell at a child that the child stutter
[1:46:41] that can affect that child's
[1:46:46] spirit that it could create a battle for
[1:46:49] them the rest of their life
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:54] when a child has a has a habit and you
[1:46:56] and you labor them it can affect their
[1:47:00] Spirit their spirit is very
[1:47:03] tender and all through they are up
[1:47:06] growing they will struggle you know they
[1:47:08] they will never they will never come to
[1:47:10] the place to appreciate themselves they
[1:47:11] will always think that uh you know they
[1:47:14] need people to tell them that they are
[1:47:16] nice or they are pretty you know uh and
[1:47:19] all of that people that always seek for
[1:47:22] people to raise them and all you know uh
[1:47:26] uh
[1:47:28] sometimes you know as as as a little
[1:47:31] person there might be called names or
[1:47:34] things said to them you know so so we
[1:47:36] all and that's what the word brings to
[1:47:39] us when the word of God is preached it
[1:47:42] brings healing in this
[1:47:45] area when Peter preach they receive the
[1:47:48] holy ghost that was healing to kenas and
[1:47:51] his household
[1:47:58] and that's the reason why that Divine
[1:48:01] Healing that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:04] is more than anything because the
[1:48:07] prophet of God said you you know well
[1:48:09] you can have that and you even lose your
[1:48:12] mind you lose your mind you're not in
[1:48:14] the right mental state it do not affect
[1:48:18] your soul
[1:48:21] [Music]
