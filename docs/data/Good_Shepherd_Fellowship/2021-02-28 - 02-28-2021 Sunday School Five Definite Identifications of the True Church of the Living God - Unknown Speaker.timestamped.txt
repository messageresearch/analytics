[0:46] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[0:50] amen famous Baptist preacher said to me
[0:52] not long ago said brother Bram Abraham
[0:54] believed God it was imputed un him for
[0:56] righteousness what more could he do but
[0:58] believe God he said we believe we
[1:00] receive the Holy Ghost when we believe I
[1:03] said but you're wrong you're honestly
[1:05] wrong Paul said in Acts 19 to those
[1:08] Baptist who had a good pastor up there a
[1:11] converted lawyer have you received the
[1:13] Holy Ghost since you have believed he
[1:15] said the original doesn't say that I
[1:17] said it does say that I've got the
[1:20] emphatic dagn and it does say it in
[1:22] every translation both Greek and Hebrew
[1:25] he said have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:27] since you believe I said Abraham
[1:30] believed that was true but God gave him
[1:32] a sign that he had accepted his faith by
[1:35] giving the Seal of
[1:36] circumcision that right he' accepted him
[1:39] because he give him a sign that he'd
[1:40] accept him if you say you believe and
[1:42] haven't received the Holy Ghost yet God
[1:44] hasn't sealed you yet hasn't had enough

[4:37] prescription and you tuck it down to the
[4:39] drugstore to some quack drug this you
[4:42] know he could kill you with that
[4:45] prescription you see that doctor writes
[4:47] so much in that because he's trained to
[4:50] that and he writes you so much
[4:53] poison and he puts an antidote in there
[4:56] to kill so much of that poison
[4:59] he has to upset something to upset the
[5:01] other drug and if that prescription
[5:03] isn't filled just exactly the way that
[5:05] doctor writes it it'll kill you amen and
[5:08] that God is the doctor he's a doctor of
[5:12] the Soul he's a doctor of Salvation yes
[5:16] and he educated the man in his own
[5:18] theology Peter an unlearned man that
[5:20] couldn't even read his name when he
[5:21] wrote before him but he give him the
[5:23] Holy Spirit and give him the pencil to
[5:25] write the doctrine about so on the day
[5:28] of Pentecost he wrot wrot the
[5:30] prescription Hallelujah let's see what
[5:32] he
[5:33] wrote Dr Simon Peter let's see what your
[5:37] prescription is for
[5:39] Salvation let's see what it was wrote
[5:41] out for now when they heard this they
[5:44] were picked in their hearts and said
[5:46] unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles
[5:47] man and Brethren what can we do watch
[5:49] out you got the
[5:51] keys then Peter said unto them repent

[6:23] doctor with the wrong thing there's no
[6:25] such a thing nobody ever baptized the
[6:26] name of father son Holy Ghost praise the
[6:29] Lord never was such a ceremony ever said
[6:31] to the Catholic
[6:32] Church the Catholic church is the mother
[6:35] of that that's right search the
[6:37] scriptures search the history and find
[6:38] out the first order was ever done by
[6:40] father Son and Holy Ghost of the
[6:41] Catholic
[6:42] priest they Franklin Franklin was
[6:45] ordained by the Catholic church right
[6:47] God mother of harlots come right back
[6:50] down to the Harlot it says in the
[6:51] catechism is there such a thing as a
[6:53] Protestant ever being saved said
[6:55] sometimes of course because they admit
[6:57] the the Catholic Doctrine they won't
[6:59] take their Bible they baptized name of
[7:01] father son Holy Ghost and they had no
[7:02] scripture for that said but the Catholic
[7:04] Church started and they admitted by the
[7:06] Catholic orders they might be some
[7:09] saved no such a thing nobody ever
[7:11] baptized that way nobody ever sprinkled
[7:14] in the Bible poured or any other way but
[7:16] immersing in the water in the name of
[7:18] Jesus Christ for the remission of sin
[7:20] what did we read a while ago and I told
[7:21] you to get to it later that
[7:24] repentance and remission of sin should
[7:28] be preached in his name Amen to where
[7:31] just to Jerusalem to the Jews to All
[7:34] Nations all the world beginning at
[7:37] Jerusalem amen not Dr Simon Peter wrote
[7:40] out the prescription what about you
[7:43] doctors amen why you trying to put
[7:45] something with it don't add nothing to
[7:47] it take it the way it is that's the
[7:48] commission of the church amen that's how
[7:50] you get into it by repenting and being
[7:53] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[7:55] the remission of your sins and a promise
[7:57] that you will receive the holy ghost now
[8:00] that's what the Bible said baptize them
[8:03] to the church baptize them to the church
[8:06] let's read Galatians 3:26 just a minute

[8:33] Jesus Galatians
[8:37] 3:26 maybe I might wrote wrong here then

[8:42] Colossians I where I was going
[8:45] to let's see if it's Colossians
[8:50] 3:26 no there is no 3:26 what is that

[9:04] closed
[9:22] are all in how do we get into this body
[9:27] how are we done it B ized by the holy
[9:31] spirit amen into the body of Christ
[9:34] Jesus now another thing the church's
[9:37] message is how we get into the church is
[9:39] through
[9:40] sanctification and sanctification
[9:42] Hebrews 13:12 and 13 Jesus suffered
[9:45] without the gates that he might sanctify
[9:47] the people with his own blood now
[9:49] Ephesians let's go here we got to read
[9:51] that one Ephesians 5:25 right quick now
[9:54] Ephesians 5 and 25 all right here we are
[9:58] five and
[10:07] 25 ah I still got the wrong thing I
[10:11] haven't got it roll down here
[10:13] right uh let's see
[10:16] therefore preachers and priest oh
[10:20] yeah I was writing this down real quick
[10:22] a while ago so I must have hit the wrong
[10:24] oh I got the wrong
[10:25] page
[10:28] amen yes yes all right Hebrews 12: 13
[10:31] Jesus suffered without the gates that he
[10:33] might sanctify the people with his own
[10:35] blood therefore people that here's how
[10:37] we come to the church by
[10:39] repenting being baptized in the name of
[10:42] Jesus Christ for the remission of our
[10:44] sins and a promise that we will receive
[10:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost therefore
[10:49] there is no preacher can shake us into
[10:52] it there's no priest that can vow us
[10:56] into it but we are bned into it by the
[10:59] king of the Messianic Kingdom amen now
[11:03] just this can I get this one more here's
[11:05] wheree how many of you stay with me just
[11:07] a few minutes long just a it's 9:30 in
[11:11] past time now can we get to heaven
[11:13] without the
[11:15] church just take a couple of comments on
[11:17] this because I got about a dozen wrote
[11:19] down here as you see but I I just one
[11:21] thing that we might know no sir you
[11:24] cannot get to heaven without being a
[11:26] member of this church now first thing in
[11:28] John
[11:29] 3 and 5 Jesus said except the man be
[11:34] borned of water and of spirit repent be
[11:37] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[11:39] the remission of sins and you shall then
[11:41] be born of the spirit born of the water
[11:44] born of the spirit except the man gets
[11:47] this he cannot even enter the kingdom of
[11:50] heaven right he cannot even see the
[11:52] kingdom of
[11:54] heaven then if you are born of water and
[11:58] spirit you are in the church if you're
[12:01] not borned of water and spirit you're
[12:03] not in the church and cannot see the
[12:05] Kingdom of Heaven is that make sense to
[12:07] you it's just exactly right now did you
[12:11] know you say well brother
[12:13] brandom I believe well listen and I've
[12:16] never received the Holy Ghost no you
[12:18] don't believe yet you are just believing
[12:21] unto believe you have hope for in First
[12:25] Corinthians the 12th chapter and the 3D
[12:28] verse let's just take grab that right
[12:31] quick while we're close to it if you
[12:32] want
[12:33] to 1 Corinthians
[12:35] 12 the 12th chapter and the third verse
[12:39] and we'll get that just right quick and
[12:41] and read this year and see what the Lord
[12:43] has in his
[12:45] Parts 1 Corinthians 12 all right and the
[12:49] third verse wherefore I give you to
[12:53] understand amen that no man speaketh by
[12:56] the spirit of God calleth Jesus a curse
[13:00] and no man can say Jesus is the Lord but
[13:06] by the Holy Ghost praise the Lord thank
[13:09] you you don't know nothing about it
[13:11] that's right until you've received the
[13:13] Holy Ghost Hallelujah you say I accept
[13:16] Jesus Christ as my personal savior have
[13:18] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[13:20] believe if you don't you can't even call
[13:23] him the Lord right because he's not Lord
[13:26] he's a historical being that you by
[13:29] Faith have accepted but when he's come
[13:31] into you by the Holy Ghost he is your
[13:33] lord no man can call Jesus Lord only by
[13:37] the Holy Ghost that's right until you
[13:40] are born of the spirit of God and the
[13:42] Holy Ghost is in you then if you are
[13:45] you're borned into this Kingdom and
[13:47] you're part of the church you're the
[13:49] called out ones a you see it all right
[13:55] now can Life come out of a k except
[14:00] that corn have life in
[14:02] it if a grain of corn is put in the
[14:05] ground one is gerti and the other is not
[14:07] gerti the one that's not gerti can it
[14:10] live again not by no means there's
[14:13] nothing in it allthough materially it'll
[14:16] make just as good just as good a corn
[14:19] flakes as the other will it'll make just
[14:22] as good a corn bread as the other and
[14:24] will it'll look just as good on the
[14:26] Shelf as the other and will but if it
[14:29] hasn't got life into it it cannot Rise
[14:32] Again amen a man that's a good man can
[14:35] be just as good church member as a
[14:38] Christian a man that's a good man can be
[14:41] just as good a citizen as a Christian a
[14:44] good man moral man but when he dies
[14:47] that's it right unless he's born again
[14:49] of the spirit of God because everything
[14:52] that had a beginning has an end amen God
[14:56] is the only thing that's Eternal
[14:58] therefore we are are a part of God by
[15:00] receiving his life Jesus said I give
[15:02] unto them eternal life the Greek word
[15:05] there is Zoe means God's own life and
[15:07] the only way that you can ever live
[15:09] again is to have eternal life which is
[15:12] God's life because your life will
[15:15] perish but his life will be raised up
[15:17] again because God is eternal and you've
[15:20] got eternal life and can more die than
[15:22] God can
[15:23] die uh he that believeth on me has
[15:26] eternal life and I'll raise him up at
[15:28] the last days amen raise him up again
[15:31] the eternal life it's anym raise him up
[15:33] yes now can we get into heaven without
[15:36] being the church you can't be in the
[15:37] church until you're borned again you
[15:39] can't go to Heaven until you're born
[15:41] again if you're born again you're in the
[15:43] church amen so you can't go to Heaven
[15:46] until you're a member of this church and
[15:49] you can't be a member until you're
[15:50] borned into it amen and now let me
[15:53] smother
[15:56] you and you can't be a member unless God
[15:59] has called you to be a
[16:00] [Music]
[16:02] member now how happy you to be for that
[16:06] for you were
[16:08] predestinated amen before the foundation
[16:12] of the world and your
[16:17] name your names was written in the
[16:20] Lamb's Book of Life the church book
[16:24] before the foundation of the world

[16:29] that's the Bible Hallelujah the Bible
[16:31] said the Antichrist the organizations
[16:34] the Catholic church with the rest of the
[16:36] organizations organizations will deceive
[16:39] all upon the face of the Earth whose
[16:42] names were not written in the Lamb's
[16:45] Book of Life before the foundation of
[16:49] the
[16:50] world Jesus said all that the father
[16:54] hath given me will come to me
[16:59] that's his own words Hallelujah not what
[17:02] you done but what he done amen let's

[21:42] it means it's spelled l El Elohim which
[21:47] means the all self-existing one the alls
[21:51] sufficient one the strong one there was
[21:55] nothing before that there was no air

[22:01] there was no there was no atmosphere
[22:04] there was no atoms there was no
[22:06] molecules there was nothing before that

[22:11] were attributes to be a
[22:14] savior to be a father to be God there he
[22:19] wasn't God then he was he was God but
[22:21] there was nothing else no worship so God

[26:14] living mate and turned the mate loose
[26:17] and the mate sprinkled it with the blood
[26:19] of the Dead mate went across the Earth
[26:22] sprinkling as he flew his wings and the
[26:24] blood splashing upon the Earth cried
[26:26] holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy

[28:02] God bring with him those that are dead
[28:06] in Christ will God brings with him
[28:11] now therefore she is a called out group
[28:15] a mystical body Christ said it in order

[28:22] said I will come and be king over this
[28:25] domain a little while in the world won't
[28:27] see me no more yet you shall see me you
[28:29] won't have nothing to do with the
[28:30] kingdom of the

[29:28] great church I'm sorry to kept you so
[29:30] late but do you believe in this great
[29:32] church do you believe in it do you
[29:34] believe it's a mystical body now you
[29:37] Catholic people the only thing you have
[29:39] to do to be a member of it is to accept
[29:41] Jesus Christ and be born of the spirit
[29:43] you Baptist you Methodist Presbyterian
[29:45] Lutheran whatever you are listen here
[29:47] don't think I'm taking up for the
[29:49] Pentecostals there's just as much
[29:51] Pentecostal Renegades as there is any
[29:54] other church that's exactly right they
[29:57] come in only by name and profession
[29:59] that's all but possession they don't
[30:01] have it that's right because when you're
[30:03] born of the spirit you become a new
[30:05] creature and God begins to deal with you
[30:07] then his sons and you're are LED of the
[30:09] spirit of God no matter what
