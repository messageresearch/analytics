[0:00] so very much Oh God for being our
[0:03] defense and for being a shield unto us
[0:08] we thank you dear Lord Jesus for
[0:13] supplying us all i need's a cording to
[0:15] thy riches in glory we are so grateful
[0:18] dear Lord Jesus for haven't cast the
[0:22] hedge around us as you did unto you that
[0:26] we are living miracles and sometimes we
[0:30] don't even realize it Lord we thank you
[0:33] so much dear Lord Jesus for how far you
[0:36] have brought us but it is purely by your
[0:40] grace that we stand where we are and
[0:44] father tonight this afternoon this
[0:47] morning we give you the glory o God we
[0:50] give you the owner and we praise thee
[0:52] dear Lord Jesus Lord I have done for us
[0:56] even for bringing us to get a father on
[0:59] a beautiful Sunday morning like this for
[1:03] the first time in the week father I'm
[1:05] seeing the Sun Rise and it is so far
[1:09] that we pray to this morning let us Sun
[1:12] of righteousness father
[1:13] o God arise in our hearts this morning
[1:16] Oh God may you lift us up lift us up by
[1:20] a mighty right hand Lord and place
[1:23] that's where we ought to be and let the
[1:26] beauty of Christ shine in our life this
[1:31] arm of father we ask in Jesus name as we
[1:33] continue to look at our topic prayer be
[1:36] with us Lord and see us true in Jesus
[1:40] name
[1:43] praise be to God so we are still looking
[1:48] we just revising week number two
[2:06] week number two looking at prayer over
[2:13] again but as I said last week maybe this
[2:19] would take us maybe a few Sunday
[2:22] mornings I don't know how long but it
[2:28] wouldn't take us much because there is
[2:31] something I have on my heart I don't
[2:37] know how things are going to go but if
[2:41] God grants us grace we'll be looking at
[2:44] it so for today I want us to look at
[2:48] Luke 11:1 again look 11:1 Luke 11:1
[3:09] and it came to pass that as he was
[3:12] praying in a certain place when he
[3:14] ceased one of his disciples said unto
[3:17] Him Lord teach us to pray and as John
[3:21] also taught his disciples praise be to
[3:25] God Matthew 6:9 my t69
[3:37] after this manner therefore pray and
[3:41] then the Lost prayer praise be to God
[3:46] after this manner therefore pray so
[3:49] we've been looking at this for quite
[3:50] some time now and now we are just going
[3:53] to go through it just look at a few
[3:56] things we've already spoken about
[3:58] trusting that God will give us a
[4:00] different perspective about some of
[4:03] these scriptures you have already seen
[4:05] now prayer is a channel of communication
[4:10] between us and God and it's a must it's
[4:18] not when you feel like it but it's a
[4:21] must that you keep this line of
[4:23] communication active at all times keep
[4:29] this channel of communication open at
[4:33] all times it does not matter the
[4:37] condition in which you find yourself
[4:41] let it be active never close it praise
[4:48] be to God now God has not limited us we
[4:55] do not have a flaw being given limited
[4:57] access to the throne of God and we
[5:02] should not limit ourselves I know some
[5:09] religious I just take it that the
[5:11] Muslims for one they pray five times in
[5:13] a day and they have specific times that
[5:18] they can go before they are God but it
[5:21] is most
[5:22] with us Christians you can go any time
[5:27] of day and God is happy to receive you
[5:33] praise be to God so do not limit
[5:38] yourself when Jesus cried on the cross
[5:46] with a loud voice and said it is
[5:50] finished when he cry when you read a
[5:54] book of Mark 15 38 when he gave up the
[5:58] ghost their Bible says the veil of the
[6:02] temple was rent in twain from top all
[6:08] the way to bottom God has given us
[6:17] unlimited access what used to be the
[6:23] prism of the high priest it's now for
[6:29] the sons and daughters of God when you
[6:33] read the book of Revelation the Bible
[6:35] says we are made kings and priests unto
[6:37] God kings and priests unto God we have
[6:46] the right to go into the inner cause of
[6:51] God any time of day on the inner
[6:56] condition and then and any number of
[7:01] times we want and God hears us do
[7:07] nothing that some people have more right
[7:11] to the throne of God than you do every
[7:15] child of God has equal access every
[7:20] child of God has equal access to the
[7:23] throne of God and don't think that you
[7:29] know
[7:31] how do I put it just to put it blunt
[7:37] if people can pray and see results what
[7:43] it means is that you can also pray and
[7:45] see results but as children of God as we
[7:52] have said time and again will she be
[7:54] sensitive to the leadership of the Holy
[7:57] Spirit to know when God says no and not
[8:04] be disappointed a lot of the times that
[8:11] would come with some resentment some
[8:13] disappointments no you should be happy
[8:15] that our Heavenly Father who knows
[8:22] everything and who knows what is best
[8:24] for you is saying no I have seen a
[8:31] family that was so much journey to get a
[8:36] car they were praying because for them
[8:39] the sign of success is getting a car and
[8:43] a house is probably the same everyone
[8:46] and they've got a car and in less than
[8:49] six months their car an accident and all
[8:51] of them died
[8:58] you should be sensitive to the
[9:02] leadership of the Holy Spirit to know
[9:05] when God says yes and when God says no
[9:08] it doesn't make any difference
[9:10] praise be to God so learn to cry before
[9:15] him constantly constantly you know
[9:24] naturally I have seen excuse me
[9:30] a child that has been stopped almost to
[9:34] death why because their child is a good
[9:37] child the parent will tell you oh I saw
[9:40] this child this child is a good child
[9:42] and you asked why Oh
[9:45] he or she doesn't cry until they are
[9:47] hungry or on to something and because of
[9:51] that they look at a child stuff but it
[9:55] is not the same with a child that knows
[9:58] how to cry if you have a baby that knows
[10:01] how to cry they got everything they want
[10:07] praise be to God their baby that can cry
[10:11] they get everything they want and
[10:14] sometimes they even get more than they
[10:16] need because their baby is full there's
[10:21] nothing wrong with the baby and yet he
[10:23] will lie and I start crying and then you
[10:25] come and you're petting him just patting
[10:29] him and he's enjoying it you put him
[10:31] down he starts crying you have to pick
[10:33] him up again they get everything you
[10:40] want
[10:43] and that is the way we should be praying
[10:45] to our Father in heaven cry to him
[10:51] constantly sometimes you see a baby so
[10:58] wet and hungry and a bi mát I will tell
[11:02] you oh this baby is good standing this
[11:04] step because the baby is good
[11:07] you start the baby is better the baby
[11:11] knows how to cry and sometimes babies
[11:15] can be mean they will wait when you are
[11:18] doing your 12 hours you come from wake
[11:21] and you are so tired and then you go to
[11:24] bed and as soon as you begin to snore
[11:27] then you start and then you jump up from
[11:29] bedroom window where you are you pick
[11:34] them up just they enjoy it and sometimes
[11:40] we get so angry with the baby this baby
[11:42] they are troubling me yeah got you what
[11:44] you want by the good thing is that with
[11:48] our God is never troubled it doesn't
[11:52] matter how many times we cry to him he's
[11:55] never troubled he enjoys it he loves it
[11:59] when you come praise be to God
[12:02] lentil cry to God learn to cry out to
[12:07] God talk to God
[12:09] let prayer be a part of your life not
[12:13] only come to God when you feel like it
[12:16] let it be something that you love to do
[12:19] something that is cherished to do the
[12:22] idea I was just thinking about hoping
[12:23] didn't it what just came that probably
[12:26] you should have made this a year of
[12:28] prayer and he kept coming to me on and
[12:32] on and on and on I said no we started
[12:36] with prayer we end up with prayer
[12:37] whatever that meant
[12:39] of course a your prayer die would it
[12:43] mean after this we'll all pray again but
[12:45] you know there is a reason white you
[12:51] know things happen
[12:53] things don't just happen for the fun of
[12:55] it let's use this opportunity to get
[12:59] closer to God you know last week when I
[13:04] was talking about prayer I mentioned
[13:07] something I said
[13:08] [Music]
[13:10] living in the way it's very very
[13:15] important in our prayer life because you
[13:19] can live in the West so much till you
[13:22] live above the flesh and I said just
[13:26] envision yourself walking up the stairs
[13:29] with every single step you take in the
[13:32] Lord it just sends you above your egg
[13:36] and then brother one comes in and is
[13:39] preaching and he talks about when the
[13:41] aeroplane flies and it goes into the
[13:44] skies you don't even see the high
[13:46] scrapers anymore
[13:47] it's not as if they are not there they
[13:50] are dead but you don't see them just you
[13:54] know these are some of the things you
[13:56] suggest there is a where God confirms
[14:01] his word and these are things we
[14:04] shouldn't just let go without taking
[14:05] notice of them live in the world we can
[14:13] never stress that enough
[14:15] let the word of God be your absolute
[14:18] whatever you do whether you go to school
[14:21] what are you awake whether you do
[14:24] business even if you choose to not do
[14:26] anything and all you want to do is just
[14:29] eat and sleep let the Word of God be
[14:31] your absolute praise be to God
[14:38] just remember we are doing a revision
[14:41] and anything is not off the board so
[14:50] prayer the more you give yourself to
[14:56] prayer the more of self you lose and the
[15:02] more of God you came
[15:10] that is why the devil would always fight
[15:14] your prayer life because the more of God
[15:20] you get in the less the avenues for the
[15:25] devil to come when the devil is coming
[15:30] the double doesn't care how many times
[15:32] you go to the gym the devil doesn't care
[15:36] the muscles you have how big and tall
[15:38] you are the devil doesn't care about
[15:40] that you are no much no human being is a
[15:45] match for the devil the devil fears only
[15:49] 1/10 and that is the work that when God
[15:54] became a man and the devil came to him
[15:58] to tempt him they would have used any of
[16:00] his powers but he didn't he used the
[16:03] word he used nothing by the word let the
[16:11] word be your absolute don't look at
[16:15] enemy don't look at anybody we are
[16:20] supposed to encourage ourselves to
[16:22] provoke one another or to good ways that
[16:25] is good but beyond that that you can get
[16:33] to that point that if anybody is not
[16:36] going you would go because you are not
[16:41] looking across your shoulders to see who
[16:44] is coming and we snot coming and the
[16:47] song says do not goes with me yet I will
[16:50] go praise be to God
[16:54] let the weight be your absolute and
[16:57] remember the more you give yourself to
[17:01] prayer the less the more of God you are
[17:08] taking in and the more you lose yourself
[17:11] when you look at the disciples when they
[17:14] gathered in the upper room what else
[17:18] what did it with you of them
[17:21] waiting for the promise of God they were
[17:24] dead the Bible says they were in one
[17:26] Accord they were in one Accord and in
[17:31] prayer
[17:37] the more you pray the more you give
[17:41] yourself to prayer the more of God you
[17:44] get in the more of God you are taking
[17:51] and when the Holy Ghost came down oh
[17:55] that was a wonderful moment if God grant
[18:00] us grace there are a lot of peers who be
[18:04] looking at praise be to God our
[18:08] relationship with God must be one of
[18:14] prayer our relationship with God must be
[18:22] one of prayer from the foundation of the
[18:26] world God has always been worshipped it
[18:30] is our time today to bring him worship
[18:33] and if Christ Paris will be dead and
[18:39] gone and it will be the tale of the
[18:45] younger ones that are coming to step in
[18:48] and worship Him he would never lose a
[18:53] witness so he's always been worshipped
[18:58] and he would always be worshipped he
[19:01] deserves to be worshipped we don't wash
[19:05] it in when we are happy only when we are
[19:06] happy only when we get what we want
[19:10] only when things are good even when
[19:13] things are bad even when things do not
[19:15] good they will want it to go God so
[19:18] desire to be worshipped praise be to God
[19:30] God loves to be Washington he loves it
[19:35] as I was just talking about babies that
[19:37] crying those that those who don't crying
[19:39] God
[19:44] he loves this relationship so much that
[19:50] even one month strayed from the path of
[19:54] righteousness when sin came to the
[19:57] garden a man straight from their part of
[20:00] righteousness God being God knew what
[20:04] had happened in the garden but that
[20:08] didn't stop him the Bible said said he
[20:12] came down in the cool of the day to
[20:18] fellowship with Adam and Eve
[20:20] and when the fall took place
[20:23] God knew it that didn't stop God from
[20:27] coming down he's talking
[20:35] God does not fellowship with anything
[20:38] that is not his nature and when the sin
[20:45] came into the garden God still wanted to
[20:49] have fellowship with his children how to
[20:51] make a way out
[20:53] the Bible says without the shedding of
[20:55] blood there can never be forgiveness of
[20:58] sin God himself took a lamb and he
[21:03] offered a sacrifice on behalf of his
[21:06] children why so he could have this
[21:10] relationship with them despite the fall
[21:14] it was not the perfect way out but girls
[21:19] still wanted to have a relationship with
[21:21] his children made a way out sometimes
[21:27] when you stray from the part of
[21:30] righteousness you think like the only
[21:32] one that is losing that fellowship no
[21:34] God also loses that fellowship God can
[21:38] no wait to hear from you he can't wait
[21:42] to hear from you if you ever fall don't
[21:50] make that place your resting place that
[21:52] is not your resting place praise be to
[21:59] God God still me the way so his children
[22:05] can still come back to him so they can
[22:08] still have that communion they were
[22:11] having before praise be to God and this
[22:19] morning when I was just getting ready to
[22:21] come something just you know started
[22:26] coming in and I took a piece of paper
[22:28] and wrote them down now we have talked
[22:31] about this before as I said we're in a
[22:35] revision week so these are things we've
[22:40] been doing before if you are bored just
[22:42] forgive me
[22:43] that is what revision can do so
[22:48] in your prayer life never insists on
[22:53] your will
[22:57] never
[23:06] when the angel came to Mary these are
[23:11] the things I'll just writing down this
[23:13] morning when the angel came to Mary and
[23:17] I knows who Hey
[23:21] the birth of the Messiah she may have
[23:26] thought about it long and hard a virgin
[23:30] how is just I'm going to take this how
[23:34] are the people going to take this with
[23:37] anybody believe anything I tell them
[23:39] they may have Turan she may have thought
[23:42] of it long and hard and she said let it
[23:47] be done unto me according to your word
[23:49] in other ways not my will but let your
[23:55] will be done
[23:57] praise be to God now when Jesus came
[24:02] when he was born when his disciples
[24:05] asked him to teach them how to pray in
[24:11] the last prayer he said thy will thy
[24:19] will
[24:25] our Father who art in heaven hallowed be
[24:28] thy name thy kingdom come thy will and
[24:38] not only there when Jesus came to the
[24:42] end of his earthly ministry in the flesh
[24:47] when he came to the end and he foresaw
[24:51] what he was going to go through the
[24:53] Bible says he prayed and prayed and
[24:56] prayed and 80s that the sweat of his
[25:02] face started dropping like a cross of
[25:05] blood this is God Himself crying God in
[25:10] human flesh praying the way he prayed
[25:13] how hot we tend to pray and when he
[25:18] talked to the Father he said let this
[25:20] cup pass away let this cup pass away
[25:25] nevertheless not my will but your will
[25:29] be done
[25:31] praise be to God not my will but your
[25:36] will be done he may have thought of Mary
[25:42] when all the earth weigh against at the
[25:45] time and Mary could look at it and say
[25:47] let your will be done and he may have
[25:50] remembered the classes he had with his
[25:52] own disciples and told them anytime you
[25:56] pray don't insist on your will let the
[25:59] will of God be done and now here he
[26:01] finds himself praying and he saying let
[26:05] this cup pass away oh he may have
[26:08] thought of here it may have thought of
[26:10] me they said no not my will but your
[26:13] will be done
[26:18] that is how important it is our will
[26:24] would always lead us into trouble but a
[26:29] will of God would always bring us life
[26:35] when trials and temptations come your
[26:38] way I don't care how hard they are I
[26:42] don't care how buddy yeah I don't care
[26:44] the spokes you go through in this life
[26:46] one thing you must never do is to
[26:50] complain never complain never ask why
[26:59] why me why not you praise be to God why
[27:07] not you why should it be somebody else
[27:17] never ask why and never complain
[27:24] instead of you asking why and
[27:26] complaining you should always ask for
[27:31] one price vertical we are in a revision
[27:40] always ask for one and if you should ask
[27:45] for one thing what would you be asking
[27:48] for in terms of trial in times of
[27:53] tribulation in terms of education when
[28:00] life is not going well when the storms
[28:03] are against you when it looks like
[28:06] everybody has abandoned you while it
[28:08] looks like nobody cares about here and
[28:13] there is nobody to lean on never
[28:20] complain never ask God why
[28:25] while she D be asking
[28:31] always ask for great
[28:35] I feel great
[28:38] always ask for strength from God for he
[28:42] is ours
[28:46] as for wisdom not deadly wisdom but
[28:51] godly wisdom pray God to give you faith
[29:00] that you are going to go through the
[29:02] storm and that your faith in God would
[29:06] not waver
[29:07] and then when you have come to the end
[29:09] of that Jenny and you look back all you
[29:14] see is the grace of God praise be to God
[29:22] prayer prayer is the key and the song
[29:27] goes Jesus started with prayer and he
[29:31] ended with prayer prayer is a master key
[29:35] Freya can unlock every single door you
[29:40] have the master key in your head you can
[29:43] unlock every single door and again you
[29:50] can look every single door
[30:00] you can unlock every door and you can
[30:02] you can you can open you can lock that
[30:05] is what the key does so when the double
[30:10] opens any door you lock that door and
[30:17] any door that door and a daughter double
[30:22] closes or locks on you you open it
[30:26] praise be to God you have the key in
[30:29] your hand the Bible says that the weapon
[30:33] of our warfare the weapons of our
[30:36] warfare are not carnal they are mightier
[30:40] to the pulling down of strongholds
[30:45] praise be to God don't limit yourself
[30:51] God has not limited why should you limit
[30:56] yourself
[31:00] when you pray believe praise be to God
[31:05] it's amazing how the time can just catch
[31:08] up on us any time so yes
[31:21] Oh
[31:24] fifteen minutes break okay so it's time
[31:28] for the 15 minutes right we are going to
[31:30] pray if you have to use the restroom
[31:35] just keep whatever you're trusting God
[31:43] for believe that God would do it if the
[31:46] rod of Iran that was dry dry there was
[31:52] no life in it there was no life in it if
[31:57] in the presence of God that rod would
[32:02] blossom and not only that but bad fresh
[32:06] almonds think about it think about it
[32:11] you sons and daughters of God
[32:12] it pays to wait praise be to God shall
[32:17] we pray our Lord and our master Jesus we
[32:22] thank you so much for the period of time
[32:25] we've had to come before this morning in
[32:27] our Sunday School class well just thank
[32:29] you for what you are doing in our lives
[32:31] we thank you so much dear Lord Jesus for
[32:35] drawing us nigh on to be that we may
[32:37] walk under the shadow of that mighty
[32:39] wings we thank you so very much Lord
[32:42] that the journey you have called us to
[32:44] you are not just sitting back and
[32:46] looking at us go through it but you are
[32:48] with us and even ahead of us we thank
[32:51] you for the victory of giving us Lord
[32:53] but we are still dependent on the same
