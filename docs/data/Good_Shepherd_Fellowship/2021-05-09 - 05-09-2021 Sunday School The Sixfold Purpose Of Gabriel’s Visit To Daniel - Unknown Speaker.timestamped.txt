[0:33] to finish what to
[0:37] finish israel's transgression
[0:42] what is a transgress is to go against
[0:45] something
[0:47] a transgress against me is to do a wrong
[0:50] to me
[0:51] transgress against you is doing wrong to
[0:54] you
[0:55] so israel did a wrong to god

[1:27] now number two write that down on your
[1:30] paper
[1:31] we just stay a long time on that but i
[1:33] don't want to go to preaching on it
[1:35] i just want to talk to you so that you
[1:37] can get us down close
[1:38] when we get into these seven seals and
[1:40] you'll just move right on to the church
[1:42] through the seals
[1:43] through the flags and know where we're
[1:45] standing amen
[1:47] all right number two make
[1:50] an end of sins
[1:57] now let's read again daniel
[2:00] to finish transgressions and
[2:04] and make an end of sins that's the
[2:07] second purpose of coming first is to
[2:10] finish
[2:10] israel's transgression and to make an
[2:13] end of
[2:14] sins where did israel
[2:17] sin where did they do their vital sin
[2:21] where did they separate themselves from
[2:24] god
[2:25] now listen close let's turn to saint
[2:28] matthew
[2:29] 24 and here's where israel made her
[2:34] fatal mistake here's where she's done
[2:37] her life
[2:38] sin and the reason she's in the
[2:41] condition today
[2:42] matthew the 27th chapter of saint
[2:45] matthew's
[2:47] gospel and
[2:50] the 25th verse of the 27th
[3:02] chapter
[3:04] let's begin about the uh uh the 21st
[3:07] verse
[3:09] the governor answered and said unto them
[3:12] whether all these twain will ye that i
[3:14] release unto you
[3:16] and they said barabbas now remember
[3:19] that's
[3:19] israel barabbas
[3:22] pilate said unto them what shall i do
[3:25] with
[3:26] jesus which is called christ
[3:30] listen adam they all said unto him
[3:34] let him be crucified
[3:38] remember that's their messiah that
[3:41] daniel
[3:42] said would come
[3:46] remember this morning in the lesson here
[3:48] you'll be cut off
[3:50] not for himself not nothing he did let
[3:52] him be crucified
[3:54] and the governor said why what evil has
[3:57] he done
[3:59] but they cried out some more saying let
[4:02] him be crucified
[4:04] then pilate saw that he could prevail
[4:06] nothing
[4:07] but rather a tunnel was made
[4:10] and he took water and washed his hands
[4:13] before the multitude saying
[4:15] i am innocent of the blood of this just
[4:18] person see to it
[4:20] listen here's your mistake
[4:24] here's your sin then answered the people
[4:28] and said
[4:29] his blood be on us and on our children
[4:33] [Music]
[4:38] he was making it in the sin for them
[4:42] how could he do anything else but
[4:44] forgive them
[4:46] knowing that he had to blind their eyes
[4:48] that we could come in
[4:49] it's like his own children calling for
[4:52] his blood
[4:54] and they were blinded and he knew they
[4:56] were blind
[4:58] that's the reason he cried for
[4:59] forgiveness for them
[5:01] forgive them father father they don't
[5:03] know what they were doing
[5:05] they were blind for our sake
[5:08] they were made blind in their unbelief
[5:12] they did this but when they see him
[5:14] again
[5:16] amen amen putting me into sin
[5:19] what is sin unbelievable
[5:22] they did not believe that was a messiah
[5:25] they could not see him to be messiah
[5:27] yeah he thought every sign the messiah
[5:29] was supposed to do
[5:30] but they could not see it they were
[5:32] blind so when you see people say i don't
[5:35] believe anybody
[5:36] i can't see it i can't see this baptist
[5:38] the holy ghost
[5:39] don't be angry with them they are blind
[5:44] they say i can't see this message of him
[5:46] coming i can't see this baptism the holy
[5:48] spirit
[5:49] i can't see the serpent see i can't see
[5:51] this stuff
[5:52] they're blind i don't know him
[5:57] just pray for them all right
[6:00] in their unbelief but when they see him
[6:03] when he comes again it will make an end
[6:07] of their unbelief
[6:10] oh my let's just turn first
[6:15] to genesis the 25th the 45th chapter and
[6:20] get a type of it
[6:21] i got wrote down here some genesis 45
[6:25] you just taking down the notes
[6:29] oh how i love this good old gospel
[6:35] all right now we know where we're
[6:40] at can you hear me all right back to the
[6:41] building say raise up your hand if you
[6:44] can hear me i
[6:45] got this sitting a little close now
[6:48] we're going to read
[6:50] a portion of this scripture i want you
[6:52] to listen to you that don't have your
[6:53] bible
[6:53] you that have your bible get genesis
[6:56] first let's start in the 44th chapter
[6:58] beginning with the 27th verse it's
[7:01] joseph
[7:02] and joseph was a perfect type of christ
[7:05] we know that
[7:06] how many knows that hated of his
[7:09] brother's why
[7:10] because he was spiritual and saw visions
[7:13] interpret dreams he was a spiritual man
[7:16] among his brethren
[7:17] and they hated him and his father
[7:20] loved him so jesus hated all the
[7:23] denominational churches
[7:25] but loved of his father god
[7:28] why did the him because he was spiritual
[7:31] amen because they told they said he was
[7:34] a fortune teller a devil
[7:36] you remember what joseph's brother said
[7:37] to him here comes that dreamer
[7:41] these same things and they sold joseph
[7:44] for
[7:44] almost the same price that judah sold
[7:47] jesus for 30 pieces of silver
[7:49] thrown him into a ditch and went and
[7:51] told the father that something killed
[7:53] him he was dead
[7:54] but he was taken up from the ditch
[7:56] christ was thrown into a ditch
[7:58] and was taken up and from there he went
[8:00] to the highest place there was on earth
[8:03] amen amen joseph went to the right hand
[8:06] of pharaoh and
[8:07] jesus went to the right hand of god
[8:09] [Applause]
[8:11] in his temptation before his exaltation
[8:14] jesus before he was exalted went through
[8:16] temptation
[8:19] why i believe this billy sunday the
[8:21] great advances
[8:22] said every every tree had a million
[8:24] angels sitting in it
[8:26] that day of the crucifixion said just
[8:28] pull your hand loose and point to us
[8:31] we'll change this scene around here but
[8:34] he couldn't do it
[8:35] carefully said he saved himself others
[8:38] he cannot save
[8:39] he didn't always find a comment if he
[8:42] saved himself he couldn't save others
[8:44] so he gave himself to save us
[8:47] he saw blind from it now they
[8:51] then when he was there in his exaltation
[8:54] or before his exaltation his temptation
[8:56] remember joseph was put into prison
[8:59] because he was innocent
[9:02] the aroma of the israelite
[9:06] general by the name of pharmacy prophecy
[9:09] went and
[9:09] went away on a trip he had a pretty wine
[9:12] and his wife had joseph come into the
[9:14] house to do something
[9:15] and he tried to get joseph to do
[9:17] something wrong and he was
[9:18] loyal to god i'll tell you there always
[9:22] you women out hard at you 9 will take up
[9:24] for you a minute
[9:28] the woman is a weaker vessel i know
[9:30] there can't be a bad man for he's a bad
[9:32] woman
[9:33] but man who knows that
[9:36] man who knows that you are a son of god
[9:39] and take advantage of a woman shame on
[9:42] you
[9:44] no matter what she does she's a weaker
[9:47] vessel
[9:49] you know then if she goes to acting i'm
[9:51] ladylike
[9:52] take her to the hand and talk to her
[9:54] like a sister
[9:56] you're a son of god don't do them evil
[9:58] things
[9:59] look at joseph he was an example to you
[10:02] and when timeless wife this beautiful
[10:04] woman
[10:04] honorable hires one of the highest women
[10:07] there was in the country
[10:08] begged him and persuaded him and he
[10:10] turned and she caught him and tried to
[10:12] hug him up to her
[10:13] and he jerked till he pulled his coat
[10:14] off and run from him
[10:16] amen yes sir i want to come into toll
[10:20] alone
[10:21] said he come in to ravish her and she
[10:23] left his and he left his coat there
[10:25] and for that he went to the dungeon but
[10:27] in the dungeon
[10:28] god was with him no matter where he put
[10:31] him
[10:32] he was a type of the son of prosperity
[10:35] everything
[10:36] joseph done prospered and when jesus
[10:38] returns to the millennium
[10:40] that's the reason that deserts will
[10:41] blossom as a rose everything he does
[10:43] will prosper
[10:45] he's the son of prosperity where are you
[10:47] but joseph it was blessed
[10:50] wherever jesus says it's blessed so get
[10:52] him in your heart
[10:53] be blessed so we find out
[10:56] that joseph then was put into a prison
[10:59] and
[11:00] in the prison there were two men one of
[11:02] them was lost and one was saved
[11:04] jesus in his temptation on the cross one
[11:07] thief was lost and the other insane
[11:10] when he was exalted he went to the right
[11:12] hand of god
[11:13] when joseph was exalted he went to right
[11:15] hand of pharaoh
[11:17] and no man could speak to pharaoh
[11:19] without speaking to joseph person
[11:21] getting permission
[11:23] and when joseph left the palace oh my
[11:27] when joseph left the palace trumpet
[11:30] sounded
[11:31] and man right ahead of him saying bow
[11:33] and e
[11:35] joseph is coming amen
[11:38] and when jesus leaves
[11:46] [Applause]
[11:53] and remember when he was rejected of his
[11:57] brethren
[11:58] what did he do he got a gentile life
[12:03] he got an egyptian wife when jesus was
[12:06] cut off from his brethren back here the
[12:08] jews
[12:08] he married a gentile bride
[12:10] [Music]
[12:10] [Applause]
[12:12] but now after years after children have
[12:16] been born
[12:17] he's from manassas he had a family
[12:21] then one day his brethren come to visit
[12:24] him
[12:26] watch we know the story how he put the
[12:29] little thing in there
[12:30] stand back and act like he couldn't even
[12:32] speak their language had an
[12:33] interpreter for the hebrew when he was a
[12:35] hebrew himself
[12:36] and her brother come down they didn't
[12:38] know him he was a mighty prince
[12:41] and right now christ visits the jews
[12:45] heels are sick and stuff and they still
[12:47] don't know who he is

[16:15] when joseph could then joseph could not
[16:18] frame and refrain himself before
[16:22] all them that stood with him brother
[16:25] that's when sin is going to be made into
[16:27] the unbelief is going to
[16:28] scatter and he
[16:31] cried and caused every man to go from
[16:34] him
[16:35] and there stood no man with him while
[16:37] joseph made himself known to his brother
[16:40] what is it

[17:02] pharaoh heard it plum
[17:03] back over into the palace they heard
[17:05] joseph screaming
[17:07] and that was a type of christ meeting
[17:09] the jews
[17:12] that he knows he blinded them
[17:15] so that we can have a chance but when he
[17:17] comes to them again

[21:17] to make reconciliations for iniquity
[21:20] use writing it down and i had about six
[21:23] other scriptures there but i'll just
[21:25] pass over it because it's hot we don't
[21:28] want to take too much time i won't get
[21:30] as much of it as they can but not
[21:32] told you too long all right

[21:36] to make reconciliations for iniquity
[21:40] iniquity is doing wrong as they did at
[21:43] the cross
[21:45] he made reconciliations but it will not
[21:47] be applied to them
[21:49] it was not applied to them why
[21:52] because they were blinded and could not
[21:54] see it am i
[21:56] and why did they blind you say well
[21:58] maybe today because i'm blind you're
[22:00] willfully blind
[22:05] they were blind because god blinded him
[22:07] that you're blind because you're
[22:09] wealthy blind there's no reconciliation
[22:12] for you
[22:15] if you believe not i am he said jesus
[22:18] you'll
[22:19] die in your sins
[22:23] that's right now let's turn back to
[22:26] zechariah again
[22:27] the 13th chapter now let's listen here
[22:31] make reconciliation uh

[28:58] just turn back
[28:59] to rebecca the second chapter
[29:04] rebecca the second chapter
[29:11] and now we're going to see why he sealed
[29:13] up this old
[29:14] serpent and what it was done for and
[29:16] what takes place
[29:17] immediately after he is sealed up

[29:26] us to a knowledge of some rebecca ibeka

[29:39] watch for the earth shall be
[29:42] filled with the knowledge and the glory
[29:44] of the lord as

[30:34] day of sweet release when our jesus
[30:37] shall come back to earth again amen
[30:41] all right now the millennium then is on
[30:46] that's when the millennium when the city
[30:48] is to be built
[30:50] for it i heard about six more scriptures
[30:52] but we'll hurry
[30:54] now when we come back i'll pick up these
[30:56] other scriptures but just get you a
[30:57] general idea
[30:58] number five to seal up the vision
[31:01] and prophecy he shall come to seal the
[31:06] vision in prophecy
[31:08] i hate to say this but some great writer
[31:10] that i was reading about today if he
[31:12] didn't have that messed up
[31:15] he said what it was just to show how
[31:18] stupid oh excuse me i don't miss it
[31:20] forgive me i don't mean that i really
[31:22] didn't no uh
[31:23] a man without anointing see
[31:27] the man said you see here that visions
[31:31] and prophecy was always allowed to the
[31:34] jewish church
[31:36] and said from daniel's time on when
[31:38] daniel come
[31:40] it meant that they would have no more
[31:42] vision or no more prophecy
[31:44] that all these things today that they
[31:46] talk about not having visions and
[31:48] prophecy
[31:49] was all a thing of the devil that there
[31:52] was no such a thing as visions and
[31:54] prophecy
[31:55] brother there was dozens of prophets
[31:58] after daniel and there were john the
[32:01] baptist there was jesus christ
[32:03] there was the prophets to the new
[32:04] testament there was angels how in the
[32:07] world can a man say that
[32:09] amen but you see that's what the selfish
[32:13] motive
[32:14] they're trying to push something over on
[32:15] the people to make a little church
[32:17] doctrine
[32:18] a little petty thing to become a reality
[32:20] to the people
[32:21] if the people haven't got the holy ghost
[32:23] they'll be deceived by them
[32:26] now let's not take what some man said
[32:29] now there's not a scripture to prove
[32:31] that
[32:32] so how could i take that well let's find
[32:34] out what really is the ceiling of
[32:52] [Music]
[33:36] so
[33:39] you
