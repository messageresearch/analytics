[37:36] hallelujah and I'll go expand the way
[37:38] quickly in Liberia hallelujah and we
[37:41] think of each degrees amen and I just
[37:45] read the Word of God in the book of
[37:46] Matthew chapter 16 and illusion and then
[37:49] Scriptures the Bible when Jesus came is
[37:52] it onto the course of video Philip paths
[37:54] and Syria fell apart
[37:56] now Jesus he no ox it's a separate
[37:59] question and he came and saying who do
[38:03] men see the son of man
[38:04] aim now when Jesus was asked the
[38:07] question was very easy because you see
[38:09] that when Jesus acts in the question
[38:11] what do arrest of men
[38:12] Who am I and the dessert was been
[38:15] answered the question it was so easy to
[38:18] say whatever Jesus and it's very easy to
[38:22] test me yy-yeah about Jesus you know so
[38:25] they some say
[38:27] also but just say you're welcome
[38:28] hallelujah I welcome you to America
[38:30] because the America before you do it he
[38:33] hallelujah so we just think also and
[38:36] when Jesus asking the question J Mahajan
[38:39] and some was saying what oh you are
[38:41] German or some say you're Elijah some
[38:44] say you are yeah one of the Prophet and
[38:46] already know get that V what I be
[38:48] hearing what people sing about Jesus but
[38:52] you see but Jesus it was so easy for
[38:54] delegate testimony what it being hearing
[38:57] but Jesus bring it to their own self and
[38:59] say about who do you see aim it means
[39:02] that I had be a personal revelation so
[39:05] he said why would you say I aim what is
[39:08] your V where is your third wish of mine
[39:09] to watch me yeah I've been working with
[39:12] all the years he welcomed in the other
[39:13] months or the years
[39:15] Yago Jesus and what do you think about
[39:17] Jesus and Jesus Ito of day he had talked
[39:19] of them he gained a power milligram
[39:21] preach the gospel when Jesus asked me a
[39:23] question about who do you see and the
[39:27] Bible said already one speechless no
[39:30] cookie no to talk or do they were goofy
[39:33] they get test them love him when Jesus
[39:36] asked me a question but who do you say I
[39:38] am they were all speechless now could he
[39:42] talk they were all stuck in a shell
[39:45] no cooking in an answer but a Bible said
[39:49] another inspiration when Peter said thou
[39:53] art the Christ the Son of the Living God
[39:56] and where Jesus said he said bless it
[40:00] and now it means that before you can
[40:03] catch the inks in Revelation or we can
[40:06] be inspired the rock and who Jesus is
[40:09] it's a blessing if you're not blessed to
[40:13] see it you can never see it hallelujah
[40:15] if I said blessed are down it means that
[40:18] change is out it's an intellect grace of
[40:20] God it's a blessing of God for you to
[40:23] open your eyes to see who Jesus is
[40:26] so if God I bless you can never see it
[40:29] and illusion is why he said blessed are
[40:32] some by Jonah and now take note that
[40:35] Israel or ask the question every
[40:38] believer
[40:39] do you think of this message what this
[40:42] message means to you and what is a
[40:45] message to you hearing the message
[40:48] negotiate a profit
[40:49] Oh Muraki 14-7 but what I took this
[40:53] message means to you because this
[40:56] message is Jesus Christ in the food as I
[40:58] come down to us is the opening of the
[41:01] world I lose in a barber because a new
[41:04] book but what is this message meant to
[41:06] you
[41:07] are you coming because you are being a
[41:10] witness terminable this message or are
[41:13] you coming because yet up as I
[41:14] appreciate ever this message about Jesus
[41:17] but what actually I meant to you as an
[41:20] individual
[41:22] hallelujah and you might come to our
[41:24] place
[41:25] or else you owner be for in your crowd
[41:29] you never come to church but what our
[41:33] today's message meant to you as an
[41:35] individual hallelujah because we techno
[41:40] church every word jesus said who do sir
[41:45] aim and salvation it's the best I
[41:49] promise from a disease it's an
[41:53] individual face it's the worst of any
[41:56] source much but I think so salvation is
[41:59] not based upon what someone as think but
[42:04] what you think of him and divine healing
[42:08] isn't based upon what a criticize Oh
[42:12] what HS is the van hearing it bears upon
[42:17] your person fit in the inspire world
[42:24] hallelujah
[42:25] it bears upon your Panther faith in the
[42:29] inspire world how you are inspired to
[42:32] believe it that will bring the result it
[42:37] is an inspiration by the world and I
[42:41] take note the Bible said all scriptures
[42:44] right all Scripture is given by
[42:48] inspiration and Alou you
[42:51] our scriptures is him an inspiration and
[42:55] is profitable for doctrine for reproof
[43:00] for correction for instruction in
[43:03] righteousness
[43:04] now the Bible said holy men will move
[43:09] but it's true of going to inspire and I
[43:13] wrote this scripture the root the Bible
[43:15] is a fool a guess apart many years apart
[43:19] they will move on an inspiration when I
[43:22] write in the Bible but a Barbuda is
[43:25] localisation in the world because were
[43:29] inspired and we'll move on and 19 to
[43:32] write the Bible
[43:33] hallelujah and just a note when I wrote
[43:37] another inspiration is what it further
[43:39] said if everybody the proposal what a
[43:44] song and for you to catch that song you
[43:47] have to be in a spirit of that composer
[43:50] before you get get the inspiration of
[43:53] the song if you don't get in a spirit of
[43:56] a composer you'll miss the pool and not
[43:59] that not that bad was that our
[44:00] scriptures is humor in special so this
[44:04] Bible is already inspired it inspired
[44:09] before the finish of the world the Bible
[44:12] is God's Word is gone into the form it
[44:14] sort of inspired so it means that to
[44:17] tell you that church the only way you
[44:20] can catch the revelation of the inspired
[44:23] Word God how to inspire you hallelujah
[44:29] and for God to inspire you is a blessing
[44:33] hallelujah it's a blessing for God to
[44:36] inspire you to see the inspire word so a
[44:39] church because Christ is the word they
[44:42] inspire so they will Grammy more
[44:44] inspiration or have been inspired but
[44:47] their problem is us their prevention me
[44:52] that were the problem so it's like that
[44:55] inspiration to drop on your heart to
[44:58] offer your eyes of understanding before
[45:01] you can see they inspire a word
[45:03] Oh s you and I come to church began the
[45:07] Munsey the word hallelujah it wouldn't
[45:11] be a guesswork then the Apostles say
[45:15] some said I Elijah some say Jeremiah
[45:18] some say I want the Prophet but who do
[45:21] you see so it was a guesswork but who do
[45:27] you say I so it took a personal
[45:32] revelation
[45:33] it took an inspiration to open your eyes
[45:36] to see the world and illusion or else
[45:40] you wanna fall in the crowd you would
[45:45] have been your top upon where I am at
[45:48] the time what do I mean to you
[45:52] and we realize that reading a Bible you
[45:55] do not read it like you would like a
[45:57] newspaper because the Bible is a wisdom
[46:01] of the Holy Spirit and it's heading many
[46:04] things the eyes of the wise and the
[46:07] prudent and revealed - babe it's sort of
[46:09] lame hallelujah so it's our scriptures
[46:13] is given inspiration hallelujah for
[46:16] reproof for correction for doctrine for
[46:20] instruction in righteousness
[46:22] hallelujah and techno church because the
[46:26] word is inspired if the word inspire you
[46:30] so much and you're inspired by the word
[46:32] because techno judge before you can be
[46:35] inspired there'll be a scene in Europe
[46:41] and techno that word jesus said thou a
[46:46] pit it means you are a pre-business seat
[46:50] of God down a pit even amid pre-tests
[46:56] mercy Eddie can never see it in that
[46:58] dollar Peter blessed are Thou are Peter
[47:02] and upon this rock I pour the inspire of
[47:07] elation is an Alabama Church and techno
[47:11] church and they be inspired so much by
[47:14] the word it take the Holy Ghost
[47:17] and then flesh and blood I'd never feel
[47:21] it to you but my father it means that
[47:24] church I take a fresh revelation of the
[47:27] Holy Ghost
[47:28] so can extract the seed that is ain't
[47:31] dog mad so putting a seed and to open
[47:34] your eyes to see the word hallelujah if
[47:41] the Holy Ghost
[47:41] don't inspire heart quicken I see you're
[47:47] gonna be based upon reasoning upon
[47:50] intellectual a pronoun reporting of this
[47:53] message what is your personal experience
[47:57] what is the message to you there are
[48:01] entire being a message in the years what
[48:04] it because they AB disciples walk with
[48:06] Christ for years between asking the
[48:10] question who do you say so no matter how
[48:17] many years you work with this message no
[48:21] matter how many years you stay in the
[48:22] church it means nothing no matter how
[48:27] long when I give you an office or a dick
[48:31] with a pretty anyone no matter how long
[48:33] he be in hallelujah Amy is what do you
[48:40] see who I am to you
[48:44] Alleluia and Jesus as enough it's
[48:47] question so if you stay get down every
[48:52] snake I question Mac the place is an
[48:55] auto ask God to open your eyes if you
[48:58] say get that in your heart of this
[49:00] message because they're having many
[49:02] doubts there are many questions some say
[49:06] Elijah some say your Jeremiah some say I
[49:09] want the Prophet but who do you see a
[49:14] and take the church and sometimes
[49:17] there's caused a price to see it the
[49:21] same jesus is it go with a price so so
[49:27] Jesus is a good price
[49:30] because if you begin to testify a base
[49:34] name then change them problem start and
[49:41] they'll go their prize to sing it out
[49:44] and sometimes it causes separation hoops
[49:52] sometimes it causes separation in
[49:56] churches sometimes it causes separation
[50:00] in all walks of life sometimes if you
[50:04] husband and wife
[50:08] you know what church because salvation
[50:12] is individual effects because you can be
[50:17] inspired to see it but I want to see it

[56:17] your heart so they get of her being
[56:20] against our inspiration against the

[56:38] body family but he is fighting against a
[56:42] personal life hallelujah he won he
[56:47] reflecting you to make you lose
[56:49] confidence in the world but he said they
[56:53] were not a promise because of the
[56:55] inspiration because of the inspired
[56:58] revelation he is fighting to destroy
[57:02] testimony so make it discourage in the
[57:05] world but a Bible get a promise it can
[57:09] never they will never prevail
[57:12] they were many firmly
[57:15] discouraged even in situation American
[57:17] edition but he can never prevail
[57:24] hallelujah
[57:25] and I thought our consolation that is a
[57:29] revelation
[57:30] now I'm not on a situation now much the
[57:33] condition he can never overcome because
[57:36] I've been there more than a conquerer
[57:39] Louie oh yes sir
[57:43] amen he said nothing mattered
[57:47] he said that shoes God said he is worse
[57:52] now when the enemy comes in it can be
[57:58] like a floor anything off Locker they
[58:01] cannot destroy everything
[58:02] what celebrity and we're coming at the
[58:04] floor is it a spirit of dog
[58:09] well stunts
[58:11] oh yes sir but this remaining like a
[58:16] floor that's sickness it's a nice
[58:19] situation it's not depression but make
[58:23] it discourage in this life so you can
[58:29] play players on you you check yourself
[58:30] you think that is not true frustrated
[58:37] sad techno church say when an enemy come
[58:41] in the key floor he said I will raise a
[58:44] standard against it he said God will do
[58:47] it when all the gets of vomit is pressed
[58:52] against that little church where the
[58:54] church the chassis and Kawa is that when
[58:58] all that get of hell is pressing against
[59:01] than in the church it will never prevail
[59:05] because she is pressing I inspire
[59:11] revelation right I made that the word so
[59:15] about Jesus or synthetic sighs you know
[59:19] sure in the world and it take the Holy
[59:22] Ghost to strut their heart to cook it
[59:25] for you to identify the world but that
[59:29] not also church
[59:30] there's many first inspiration out there
[59:34] there may be false inspiration because
[59:37] every inspiration should come back the
[59:40] world hallelujah now I say the
[59:48] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[59:50] today true believer can never be over
[59:54] emphasized in that revelation means to
[59:57] you that perhaps you realize I am NOT
[1:00:01] talking about this book of Revelation
[1:00:04] I'm talking about all revelation it is
[1:00:07] tremendously important to the church and
[1:00:10] they then do you remember Marty sixteen
[1:00:13] if we are back to the scriptures the
[1:00:16] third hour of Jesus or think to all the
[1:00:17] importance of revolution to the church
[1:00:22] inspiration
[1:00:24] to strut your heart and they say for
[1:00:26] flesh and blood
[1:00:27] how do you fit it to you but no
[1:00:33] intellect remind no reason waiting the
[1:00:38] Holy Ghost to open your eyes
[1:00:39] hallelujah and now techno church where
[1:00:43] you see and that is world the Bible is
[1:00:47] our ultimate no matter God said let
[1:00:52] every man word be la and mommy is I
[1:00:56] believe that the Bible is God ultimate
[1:00:59] no matter what anybody else say it is
[1:01:02] the ultimate that Bible is not a book of
[1:01:06] system no it is a cool of Morris the
[1:01:12] Bible is not a book of system there are
[1:01:15] so many sister and so forth but a Bible
[1:01:19] is not a book or system no a book of
[1:01:22] history or together
[1:01:24] Neera it is a book of the logic but a
[1:01:27] Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ it
[1:01:37] is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's
[1:01:40] all learn to read that hallelujah it is
[1:01:45] a revelation be my dad even in chapter 1
[1:01:48] verse 1
[1:01:49] is it a revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:01:51] the church would it judge the bra amen
[1:02:02] so it's been a good ethics you know a
[1:02:06] book of history of theology but it is a
[1:02:08] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:10] god I'm sorry Jordan from the word to
[1:02:13] flesh and now take note when a man is
[1:02:21] inspired and go inspire you and go pull
[1:02:25] you out and a man is inspired and he
[1:02:29] read the Aspire word then that total
[1:02:34] gather bring result
[1:02:38] it does not matter how well you studied
[1:02:42] the word it will never do you any good
[1:02:45] until you're inspired not magic every
[1:02:50] day instead every description also done
[1:02:53] we are education would not do anything
[1:02:55] to you or let's go inspiring to see so
[1:03:00] if God inspire you and you read that is
[1:03:04] by a word into the tech note where both
[1:03:07] is spirit can forget I said you see
[1:03:10] miracle to complete
[1:03:11] you see we shot in the church that dance
[1:03:14] or the preacher is inspired and you can
[1:03:16] prayer up and you come to touch inspire
[1:03:19] and inspire one booth pop improve
[1:03:22] miracles in the church and a part of the
[1:03:25] entire church a series shot in the
[1:03:29] church become prettier inspire go moving
[1:03:36] to miss the believers but if they're
[1:03:39] probably us how do we come to church
[1:03:44] do come expecting through come on Marty
[1:03:48] go yet from the power of God's Word
[1:03:50] because come I want to check when go
[1:03:52] other who rob show the world but we'll
[1:03:55] come to the house of God is a revival
[1:03:58] against my church and if inspire was
[1:04:01] coming for a big revival in your life it
[1:04:04] take other trash amen
[1:04:10] but it is it how come to church church
[1:04:14] hallelujah so when it means inspired and
[1:04:18] he read an inspired word and it took
[1:04:20] inspiration come together it if result
[1:04:23] no matter how well you study the world
[1:04:25] till it will never do any good till you
[1:04:28] inspire yourself it take your
[1:04:31] inspiration with the word that already
[1:04:34] inspired what we need to be as an
[1:04:37] inspiration over us God
[1:04:40] sweep it down with a new inspiration and
[1:04:43] breathing over us his power his love
[1:04:47] himself and
[1:04:49] mmm inspire us in my quit in the world
[1:04:53] of going to a heart in my brain that
[1:04:55] would have dog by the hood and spirit by
[1:04:57] inspiration that you see miracle taking
[1:05:00] place and things happening that is why
[1:05:06] we saw God represent himself as the
[1:05:09] makers bred on another dog he had no God
[1:05:12] and the meatiest and him on earth as a
[1:05:15] lamb because I think both nature to
[1:05:17] blame and that is my church to bring me
[1:05:20] shock hallelujah so I think you that
[1:05:23] don't inspire you and they inspire work
[1:05:25] come together the result we got a to
[1:05:30] nature ship bling hallelujah
[1:05:36] you're naturally convicted for the
[1:05:38] things of this world to the nature of
[1:05:40] the Holy Ghost wanted to come together
[1:05:44] every we saw if your nature convicted
[1:05:49] today nature of the hooligans when they
[1:05:51] to come together every result it bring
[1:05:55] the Word Alive America can say every
[1:06:00] chapter every fresh is mine
[1:06:03] hallelujah oh yes sir then you don't
[1:06:06] read it the hop or read the Bible you
[1:06:08] read it with the eyes of God then you
[1:06:12] not a death it's my move you don't
[1:06:17] gather the Messiah teased by the word
[1:06:19] hallelujah a man
[1:06:22] oh yes server now one turn was on the
[1:06:29] Bible there was Elijah Elijah Elijah
[1:06:33] knew that God was taking away a new the
[1:06:37] God had a son replacing so goggle taking
[1:06:42] away and he went for and there was
[1:06:45] Elijah proud see but there's a seat I
[1:06:51] was lying in a Shabbat so we sort of a
[1:06:55] light or passing back he took his motto
[1:06:58] and that's not Elijah what happened if
[1:07:02] clicking that see Elijah Lou because
[1:07:06] Elijah the spirit of moving to Elisha
[1:07:08] and Elijah big a predestined that see
[1:07:13] Jenna be quickly
[1:07:14] Alleluia and we saw in a month autosh
[1:07:18] him and put in that seat
[1:07:20] you saw that Elijah run to Elijah and
[1:07:24] say can you beat me to get kiss my
[1:07:29] mother for a good bath began you
[1:07:31] recognize him Anna Massey s moderate
[1:07:33] burns anymore he were permitted to wear
[1:07:36] kiss of money for Cuba but we saw in a
[1:07:39] New Testament it wasn't permitted today
[1:07:43] they'll bury the dead
[1:07:45] amen and I'll take note because enlarge
[1:07:49] was so much inspired no one tell enlarge
[1:07:53] what I do in like the Mogul thing I said
[1:07:55] okay you my party if you go this way
[1:07:57] if you do these things you do this no no
[1:07:59] no no no that is inspirational upon him
[1:08:02] drop him hallelujah
[1:08:05] I don't do Church of God inspire you no
[1:08:08] one tell you what to do he was so much
[1:08:13] inspired what Elijah did he went and
[1:08:16] take the oxen he's with new pieces
[1:08:20] he took the instrument he burned
[1:08:22] everything and he thought that that that
[1:08:25] that the tattoos he burned and make as
[1:08:28] sacrifice in the words that he said it
[1:08:35] was a son that he has is so out for
[1:08:40] everything to be a prophet he said he
[1:08:44] wearing to make every sacrifice to show
[1:08:48] he will do anything for the cost of the
[1:08:52] work Honolulu in sir what and lesson we
[1:08:58] could get tonight now every man every
[1:09:02] woman that cometh to Christ
[1:09:04] put his hand upon the play and start so
[1:09:07] even their back is not what to the plow
[1:09:10] so there there is a reason we have such
[1:09:14] a time we have four day is
[1:09:17] because they're too much have we
[1:09:19] conviction they're too much eat the
[1:09:23] electro conviction it's what you get any
[1:09:26] problem to this halfway conviction but
[1:09:29] we're gonna go don't make and have where
[1:09:31] Kristen door don't make and have a
[1:09:34] conviction yourself Commission's of
[1:09:36] halfway because go make a complete
[1:09:40] Kristen and Polly preacher and that
[1:09:43] delivers but you can make us a halfway

[1:18:59] going to the sea the brother the work
[1:19:02] well he having seen any inspiration he
[1:19:07] said because he was used to eat he they
[1:19:13] were used to it
[1:19:15] he said and dyes the matter with the
[1:19:19] Pentecostal church and the rest of them
[1:19:22] today you are so used to seeing the
[1:19:27] power of God you are so used to seeing a
[1:19:31] girl of God you are so used to seeing
[1:19:34] the goodness of God until you don't pay
[1:19:39] attention to it anymore and we seen upon
[1:19:44] us people come to church always a sink
[1:19:48] or service and when I said that I am a
[1:19:50] king
[1:19:51] they also used to the preacher preached

[1:20:29] every some 15 say it so they don't come
[1:20:32] in expectation they are so used to eat
[1:20:39] so they put your preach they don't take
[1:20:42] the world what is important is our
[1:20:46] pastor
[1:20:47] so they take everything lightly
[1:20:52] hallelujah he said they are so used to
[1:20:57] the goodness of the Lord till they don't

[1:43:27] the inspiration of the Almighty Allah
[1:43:32] who said in the book of Job he gives
[1:43:34] wisdom and that word inspiration
[1:43:38] actually means the breath of God if you
[1:43:42] are inspired it means that God had
[1:43:44] breathed upon you
[1:43:47] and you have become a living soul we
[1:43:51] know there are a lot of life support
[1:43:54] system in the world the world has
[1:43:58] created his own life support some people
[1:44:01] have gone to clubs and ambass and
[1:44:04] drinking to get life support but it
[1:44:08] takes the breath of God and let you and
[1:44:11] myself here tonight sitting under the
[1:44:14] inspired Word of God
[1:44:15] praise the Lord Amen praise the Lord

[1:44:27] live again Ezekiel say Lord you know
[1:44:32] okay I will show you how the bones can
[1:44:34] live it's by the word prophesied breathe
[1:44:37] upon it every time we sit under the
[1:44:41] preaching of God's Word you are under
[1:44:43] the breath of God and not to respond
[1:44:46] back to God's Word with a life of
[1:44:49] repentance or a life that is watered of
[1:44:52] the gospel it's a testimony that you are
[1:44:55] there every time you sit under the Word
[1:45:00] of God that's the breath of God God is
[1:45:03] breathing upon you to give you life to
[1:45:07] give you strength to give you wisdom to
[1:45:10] give you guidance
[1:45:14] that's what Jesus said man shall not
[1:45:16] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:45:19] that comes from God's mouth that's what
[1:45:24] man Libra because that's the breath of
[1:45:26] God that's the inspiration of the
[1:45:30] Almighty
[1:45:31] praise the Lord now lochia brother
[1:45:34] Elijah said something and you are
[1:45:35] reading there from where Branham the
[1:45:37] difference between Peter inspiration and
[1:45:39] Peter mistake
[1:45:42] praise the Lord just just think about it
[1:45:46] he was the one that said thou I cried
[1:45:49] son of the Living God and then when it
[1:45:53] came to to the total to the apalis Hall
[1:45:57] before the crucification he was denying
[1:45:59] the Lord Jesus but he had that
[1:46:06] inspiration within him and sometimes
[1:46:10] that is the thing that keeps us in our
[1:46:12] weaknesses in our failure the breath of
[1:46:17] God the inspiration that Jesus is the
[1:46:21] Christ that he is the Living God it's
[1:46:25] more powerful
[1:46:29] and that's what the church is built upon
[1:46:31] you see that's the reason why the church
[1:46:33] is a mystical body the church is not the
[1:46:36] amount of people the church is the
[1:46:40] breath of God in the mists of the people
[1:46:43] that's the church the gifts of Hell can
[1:46:46] never prevail against their the gifts of
[1:46:49] Hell can scattered thousands of people
[1:46:51] all of these mega churches when their
[1:46:53] money is gone
[1:46:54] the church is gone because the money is
[1:46:58] the lifeline but the Church of the
[1:47:00] Living God the lifeline is the Word of
[1:47:03] God you love the Lord tonight Saturday
