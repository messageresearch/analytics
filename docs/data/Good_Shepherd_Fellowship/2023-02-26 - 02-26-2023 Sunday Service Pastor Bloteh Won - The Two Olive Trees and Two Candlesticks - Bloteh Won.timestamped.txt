[25:11] when I first came here this morning it
[25:13] was kind of cold and I got hot all of a
[25:15] sudden wonderful
[25:19] man a quick testimony I wanted to share
[25:21] with you guys
[25:22] you know so the glory and honor of God
[25:25] um
[25:26] so you know lately I just been having on
[25:29] my heart to pray I've been praying a lot
[25:31] more
[25:32] and it'll be strange times I'll be
[25:33] eating out of nowhere I just feel this
[25:36] strong conviction to pray and I put my
[25:39] my food on the side before you know I'm
[25:40] praying I can be watching something and
[25:43] I'll see something very unfortunate or
[25:45] sad and it would just cause me to pause
[25:47] when I'm watching and
[25:49] I'll just start praying and I don't know
[25:52] when it started or where it came from
[25:54] but I thank God that is coming you know
[25:57] and
[25:59] and as Christians I believe that you
[26:02] know prayer is one of our best weapons
[26:05] you know and just the thought of
[26:08] thinking that you know the weakest one
[26:10] Among Us which may be me I don't know
[26:12] but the weakest one among us if we would
[26:14] just get on our knees and pray what we
[26:16] can do to Satan's kingdom and I just the
[26:20] reason I share this with you guys
[26:21] because at work
[26:23] there's this lady I talked to
[26:26] she just turned 50 and we can talk a lot
[26:29] but one day he was there and she was
[26:31] just kind of angry kind of frustrated
[26:33] and I noticed it
[26:35] but normally when people was like that
[26:36] kind of give them time so that day went
[26:38] and it passed and then the next day I
[26:40] went to her I said are you okay she's
[26:42] like yeah I'm good I said you short she
[26:44] was like yeah you know I just kind of
[26:45] made a joke about it you know I seen you
[26:47] throwing biscuits around just wanted to
[26:48] make sure you're okay she had to laugh
[26:51] and she said I'm okay and she went on
[26:53] her phone and she pulled out something
[26:55] and she showed it to me and it was her
[26:58] older sister she was in a hospital bed
[27:00] and she had like tubes going to through
[27:02] her nose and just all manner of things
[27:06] was wrong with her she said she was
[27:07] unresponsive for weeks she's been in the
[27:09] hospital bed she's not answering nobody
[27:12] I believe in just all these things and
[27:14] she was just so broken down she was
[27:16] really sad about it and she she said she
[27:19] was worried
[27:20] so I looked at her and said what's your
[27:21] sister's name and she kind of smiled at
[27:23] me she said her name was Rebecca
[27:25] I said okay I'll pray for Rebecca and
[27:27] that was a Saturday
[27:28] we had church on Sunday and I was going
[27:31] to write it down so we can all pray
[27:33] together but for some reason they just
[27:35] escaped my mind
[27:36] and Sunday came and it went
[27:39] I didn't go to church I didn't go to
[27:40] work that day
[27:42] so the the following day I was in my
[27:46] room and I was praying
[27:48] and out of nowhere I just felt you know
[27:50] I'm just I'm just I just felt this
[27:52] presence come in a room and up
[27:55] our voices came to me not not literally
[27:57] but in my heart and it said you know
[28:00] when you feel the presence of the spirit
[28:02] of God ask for the impossible you know
[28:05] ask for something that you wouldn't ask
[28:06] for any other time and
[28:09] it just happened really fast as I was
[28:11] thinking what to ask for I started
[28:13] praying for my co-worker sister
[28:15] that she would come out of the hospital
[28:17] that she would be healed that she would
[28:19] be well and I just started praying for
[28:21] her and I did something very strange I
[28:22] started to thank God for the prayer that
[28:24] I just prayed I I normally don't do that
[28:27] but I just started to thank him for
[28:29] answering that prayer I said thank you
[28:30] so much oh lord for healing her and
[28:32] bring her out of the hospital
[28:35] we serve a prayer answering God you know
[28:38] I want to work the following day
[28:41] and I was I was there I was working and
[28:43] the lady came to me she was just all
[28:45] jumpy and happy and stuff I looked at
[28:47] her and she just kind of hit me I said
[28:49] what's up she said
[28:50] guess what
[28:52] in my mind I just knew it I just knew it
[28:54] she said guess what I said what

[1:05:33] waiting to follow
[1:05:35] brother George Martin's funeral in South
[1:05:37] Africa

[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:25] thank you
[1:10:27] praise the Lord
[1:10:29] I don't know where that high-pitched
[1:10:31] verse came from
[1:10:33] but I was able to put it out amen
[1:10:37] praise the Lord
[1:10:39] the Lord bless you musicians that will
[1:10:41] be all
[1:10:42] for the singing
[1:10:44] as uh we will take our Bibles turn to
[1:10:48] Revelation chapter 11.
[1:10:51] we started speaking on the on
[1:10:54] the measure in the injure
[1:10:57] and why I was
[1:11:01] standing on that and and trying to look
[1:11:03] into it
[1:11:07] there was there was something that
[1:11:09] caught my mind during the week
[1:11:11] I was traded a little bit from that and
[1:11:14] just go into
[1:11:16] a few prophecy here so let's go back to
[1:11:18] Revelation chapter 11.
[1:11:24] and just like I said I really I need the
[1:11:27] grace of God to help
[1:11:28] and I think
[1:11:30] I got a text message in a week I think
[1:11:33] brother Freddie there's uh
[1:11:36] uh sister Rachel and married yet Dad I
[1:11:39] think they were back from uh their
[1:11:41] travel he should be traveling sometime
[1:11:43] in the week so we want to keep them in
[1:11:46] prayer that he will have a safe trip
[1:11:49] back to the Congo we enjoyed our brother
[1:11:53] really didn't have much time to be able
[1:11:56] to visit with him but we pray that the
[1:11:58] Lord will give us a good time Revelation
[1:12:00] chapter 11
[1:12:02] and there was giving me a read like onto
[1:12:05] a rod and the angels still saying rise
[1:12:10] and measure the temple of God
[1:12:14] the altar
[1:12:15] and then and then they are worship
[1:12:18] therein so we were looking at those
[1:12:20] three things last week measuring the
[1:12:23] temple measuring the altar the altar
[1:12:26] represents the place of sacrifice it
[1:12:29] also represents the place that the word
[1:12:31] comes from
[1:12:33] and then uh and and also measuring the
[1:12:37] people that worship their Inn now verse
[1:12:40] two
[1:12:41] but the court which is without the
[1:12:45] temple
[1:12:45] leave out
[1:12:48] and measure it net
[1:12:52] for it is giving unto the Gentiles
[1:12:55] the Gentiles in this sense will
[1:12:58] represent the heathens
[1:13:02] okay the healings so we will grab
[1:13:05] ourselves right here you realize that
[1:13:07] just by looking at this scripture
[1:13:11] being born again and coming into the
[1:13:13] kingdom of God God puts us under his
[1:13:17] rule of measurement
[1:13:19] and then he's going to deal with us
[1:13:21] different than the way he deal with the
[1:13:23] sinners
[1:13:25] praise the Lord they have things they
[1:13:28] would do they would get by with faith
[1:13:29] they have things you will do it don't
[1:13:32] fit under that measurement so God's
[1:13:34] going to deal with you for it
[1:13:40] but the courts wish
[1:13:42] is without the temple leave out and
[1:13:46] measure it net for it is given unto the
[1:13:49] Gentiles and the holy city shall be
[1:13:53] tread on the fort
[1:13:55] Y and two months
[1:13:59] 40 in two months the calculation will be
[1:14:02] three and a half years
[1:14:04] so this is putting us right in
[1:14:08] the tribulation time
[1:14:12] and now we give power unto my two
[1:14:15] witnesses
[1:14:17] they shall prophesy
[1:14:21] a thousand two hundred and free schools
[1:14:25] a day clothed in sackcloth
[1:14:28] a thousand
[1:14:31] 203 school days will come to three and a
[1:14:35] half years
[1:14:40] these are the two olive trees now this
[1:14:44] is the thing that grabbed my attention
[1:14:45] during the week
[1:14:47] these are the two olive tree
[1:14:50] and the two candles take
[1:14:54] standing before the god of the Earth
[1:14:59] so these two witnesses
[1:15:01] are the two olive trees Zacharias
[1:15:05] chapter 4 speaks about the two Olive
[1:15:07] Tree and the two candlestick
[1:15:10] let's buy our heads we pray Heavenly
[1:15:12] Father we will ask your blessings upon
[1:15:15] your word

[1:16:29] amen amen
[1:16:32] the Lord bless you you may have your
[1:16:33] seat
[1:16:34] uh but then you please you can please
[1:16:37] come back down
[1:16:38] let me ask a service from you
[1:17:01] just take uh
[1:17:04] uh the
[1:17:06] let's take
[1:17:09] Matthew chapter 17 Matthew chapter 17.
[1:17:17] when I was studying on this message I
[1:17:19] would be very friend with you uh came up
[1:17:23] okay I came up with uh with some
[1:17:27] some things in my notes were
[1:17:29] I was really going to pull up my gloves
[1:17:33] and uh
[1:17:36] you know and and be be friend with you
[1:17:39] and uh in uh in bringing some things
[1:17:43] and then uh now that I changed my mind
[1:17:46] though
[1:17:47] because uh I'm just going into this like
[1:17:50] I said the thought of the two Olive Tree
[1:17:52] and the two Candlestick caught my caught
[1:17:55] my heart during the week and I started
[1:17:58] looking into the ministry of Moses in
[1:18:00] Elijah
[1:18:01] which of course the Bible will identify
[1:18:04] the as the two olive trees and why God
[1:18:07] will call those two men the two olive
[1:18:11] trees and uh so we we will be looking at
[1:18:15] some few passages I don't think I would
[1:18:17] be through them but uh
[1:18:21] uh
[1:18:24] you know and and so just like I said I
[1:18:27] was thinking on uh
[1:18:29] uh you know just just bringing uh some
[1:18:32] things
[1:18:33] you know and being and just being uh
[1:18:37] out right with you
[1:18:41] as a church
[1:18:43] and uh
[1:18:46] because
[1:18:52] you know I was I was actually thinking
[1:18:54] about it
[1:18:55] uh
[1:18:57] and I was I was talking to someone
[1:19:01] and they thought you know just just kind
[1:19:04] of autonomy uh the Lord
[1:19:07] uh
[1:19:09] David dear says in the in the psalm
[1:19:12] teach teach me to normal Mondays that
[1:19:14] will apply my heart to wisdom
[1:19:17] and uh uh you know if you you look at it
[1:19:22] you you will realize that himalay we
[1:19:25] always we always have the idea
[1:19:29] to look at our life
[1:19:32] in uh in in a space of 100
[1:19:35] percentage-wise
[1:19:38] you know uh uh even even the child that
[1:19:43] is that is that is born today and if the
[1:19:47] Lord choose to call their child that
[1:19:50] child has fulfilled percentage-wise 100
[1:19:54] because that was the time that was
[1:19:56] allotted for them
[1:19:58] but you see with we human what we do is
[1:20:01] the other we think that uh uh 100 we
[1:20:07] take the the the thought of percentage
[1:20:10] and we we place that in our mind in the
[1:20:14] back of our mind we place there to our
[1:20:16] years
[1:20:18] but you if you if you look at it the
[1:20:20] Bible says we have appointed three
[1:20:22] scores and ten which is 70.
[1:20:25] so when you hit 35 you're already in the
[1:20:28] middle in your middle age
[1:20:33] you're already in your middle age
[1:20:35] and uh if you hit 40
[1:20:38] I mean you have cross middle if you
[1:20:40] cross middle you're already on the other
[1:20:42] side you're on the downside
[1:20:45] praise the Lord it might sound funny to
[1:20:48] you but you know just thinking about it
[1:20:51] it makes me to to realize that uh
[1:20:55] you see uh
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:58] when you pass your first 25
[1:21:02] and and you have not been able to
[1:21:05] establish
[1:21:06] a purpose
[1:21:09] if the grace of God have now been able
[1:21:11] to help you to establish the purpose for
[1:21:15] your life
[1:21:16] no wonder you find people you know uh
[1:21:20] they just get into this uh uh Wilderness
[1:21:24] wandering you know they just they just
[1:21:27] go about and you know and and God in in
[1:21:30] in his law we know that just like
[1:21:33] there's a lot of contracts there's a lot
[1:21:36] of reproduction and God puts all of
[1:21:38] these laws they are also on written laws
[1:21:41] that are that are that govern the
[1:21:43] universe
[1:21:44] you know they are read on written law
[1:21:46] that govern the universe there was
[1:21:48] something that that blessed my heart
[1:21:50] during the week talking about this and
[1:21:53] uh uh uh
[1:21:57] and I I just kind of wrote that down uh
[1:22:01] I work as I was I was thinking about it
[1:22:04] you know uh David said in the in the
[1:22:08] psalm psalm 19 the heavens declared the
[1:22:11] glory of God okay and they have showed
[1:22:15] his handiwork
[1:22:16] you will realize that there are two
[1:22:20] things you go to Genesis from the
[1:22:22] beginning Genesis talks about the
[1:22:24] creation
[1:22:25] okay so God's creation you look at the
[1:22:29] creation you look at the heavens you
[1:22:31] look at the mountains you look at the
[1:22:33] things that God have created they
[1:22:35] declare that there is an intelligence
[1:22:39] behind it even if the ATS want to
[1:22:42] believe that there is no God but it
[1:22:44] shows that there cannot be other or
[1:22:47] design without an intelligence
[1:22:50] praise the Lord
[1:22:52] you see
[1:22:53] and uh
[1:22:56] but
[1:22:58] if you want to understand
[1:23:02] The Plan of Redemption
[1:23:07] there is very little
[1:23:11] the work the heavens and everything that
[1:23:13] God created speaks more of his work of
[1:23:17] creation
[1:23:19] but the work of redemption
[1:23:23] just like how the heavens declare the
[1:23:27] glory of God
[1:23:29] the Bible
[1:23:31] Halls
[1:23:33] the Bible sells just like the heavens
[1:23:37] it holds the mystery of redemption
[1:23:43] praise the Lord
[1:23:45] your father that people
[1:23:48] they they appreciate the creative work
[1:23:51] of God
[1:23:52] but they argue against his work of
[1:23:55] redemption why Jesus is the why why is
[1:23:58] Jesus the only way
[1:24:01] praise the Lord you see because the work
[1:24:04] of creation the work of redemption the
[1:24:06] mystery of redemption is it just cannot
[1:24:10] be understood after you have discovered
[1:24:13] the mystery of redemption through God's
[1:24:16] word then you can now connect it to
[1:24:19] Creation
[1:24:22] but outside of God's word there is no
[1:24:27] way you can understand
[1:24:29] the mystery of redemption so you cannot
[1:24:32] expect the Buddhists to understand it
[1:24:34] you cannot expect the mohammedans to
[1:24:37] understand it to be able to understand
[1:24:39] God's work of redemption is is placed in
[1:24:44] this book
[1:24:45] that's what this book holds
[1:24:48] praise the Lord
[1:24:50] amen and that's the reason why or unless
[1:24:54] unless we have accepted God Redemptive
[1:24:58] plan this book will not even make any
[1:24:59] sense to you
[1:25:02] it won't make no sense to you
[1:25:05] praise the Lord
[1:25:07] now so it's it's it's beautiful that way
[1:25:10] forgive me I will be all over the place
[1:25:13] so when you really think about it young
[1:25:15] people I'm addressing this to you if you
[1:25:18] really think about it you have to put
[1:25:20] your your I mean uh
[1:25:24] you have to put some things into
[1:25:26] perspective
[1:25:29] because every day you are adding to your
[1:25:32] age
[1:25:33] you are not getting younger
[1:25:36] amen
[1:25:40] from the first date is a day old
[1:25:43] it's not a day Young
[1:25:46] it's a day oh
[1:25:48] praise the Lord
[1:25:51] amen
[1:25:53] and what whatever wherever our lifespan
[1:25:57] is going to stop to God it's a hundred
[1:26:01] percent
[1:26:04] when you reach that 100 he call your
[1:26:06] card off
[1:26:10] some has been blessed to reach 70 then
[1:26:14] over 70. God bless you
[1:26:19] praise the Lord
[1:26:21] yeah he's my good friend
[1:26:23] amen and then and and it's it's a
[1:26:26] blessing of God
[1:26:28] amen so if you if we put this thing in
[1:26:32] your head and says well I'm 24 I'm I'm
[1:26:35] 23 then and you just think that you have
[1:26:39] all the time
[1:26:40] to fool around
[1:26:47] praise the Lord
[1:26:50] and you can now put a purpose to your
[1:26:53] life
[1:27:03] now so
[1:27:05] another thing
[1:27:07] about
[1:27:09] the mixture of creation and Redemption I
[1:27:11] want you to appreciate is that
[1:27:14] God made the son
[1:27:20] to serve the universe
[1:27:23] oh I pray that the Lord help us we bring
[1:27:25] this out to you
[1:27:27] and everything that God made
[1:27:29] they serve us
[1:27:33] praise the Lord
[1:27:36] what are you you like it or not if the
[1:27:39] snow want to calm down they don't listen
[1:27:40] to your cry
[1:27:42] it does not have a phone number for you
[1:27:44] to call it and tell it don't come
[1:27:46] is going to come and serve its purpose
[1:27:50] praise the Lord and this is what I want
[1:27:53] you to realize
[1:27:54] if the Lord will help us before I get
[1:27:57] into the life of these two men
[1:28:00] that is the same thing with Redemption
[1:28:04] that is the reason why you will never
[1:28:07] enjoy you know this thing the Bible says
[1:28:09] uh Salvation is a free gift
[1:28:15] and you always hear this you know people
[1:28:17] talk about uh is is individual affair
[1:28:21] the individual had a fair that is in
[1:28:24] Salvation is that when God gives you the
[1:28:27] gift of Salvation he don't give it to
[1:28:30] you and anybody at the same time he gave
[1:28:33] it to you individually
[1:28:35] praise the Lord but with them when you
[1:28:38] receive the gift of Salvation is no
[1:28:41] longer individual
[1:28:43] the gift is individual it's given to you
[1:28:46] individually
[1:28:48] praise the Lord but the mystery of
[1:28:51] redemption
[1:28:52] is just like the mystery of creation is
[1:28:55] to save the universe the mystery of
[1:28:58] redemption is that God now has given you
[1:29:01] a gift for you to go and sell that's the
[1:29:06] reason why the gift is not for you
[1:29:09] the gift is for the people
[1:29:15] now that's the reason why you will see
[1:29:17] in the Bible that God will set the life
[1:29:20] of a man
[1:29:21] I thought about this just thinking about
[1:29:24] all of these brothers and uh uh brother
[1:29:27] George Howard cancer in his body but I
[1:29:30] mean that man was he was always on fire
[1:29:32] for God when he preached you never know
[1:29:35] that this man is bartering cancer
[1:29:38] praise the Lord
[1:29:40] amen he uh just did a series uh recently
[1:29:46] that the the brothers in Germany asked
[1:29:48] him to do on the 10 sons of hit I mean
[1:29:50] the ten sons of Hitler yeah he called it
[1:29:53] the 10 sons of Hitler
[1:29:54] and a very beautiful series that was one
[1:29:57] of the last piece that he did I mean
[1:29:59] very beautiful he got a good start of
[1:30:01] teaching
[1:30:02] but you look through the scripture
[1:30:04] that's what I wanted I wanted I want us
[1:30:06] to come to you will see that God will
[1:30:08] set a man look look at that God I told
[1:30:12] the Levi's there was no inheritance for
[1:30:15] the Levi's they never had any Heritage
[1:30:17] they never had a land that was given to
[1:30:19] them nothing they did they were not
[1:30:22] asked to have an inheritance but yet
[1:30:24] they were to be to the service of the
[1:30:26] people
[1:30:27] they were supposed to be to the service
[1:30:30] of the people
[1:30:33] that God will put a man he would give a
[1:30:36] man a calling or give a man a gift and
[1:30:39] he will live all his life for in better
[1:30:42] people
[1:30:45] praise the Lord
[1:30:47] amen
[1:30:48] to him better people
[1:30:52] sometimes
[1:30:54] the people think that
[1:30:57] a call to the ministry is the place of
[1:31:00] wealth
[1:31:03] but you don't understand it
[1:31:07] you don't understand it
[1:31:09] I come back to my measurement I would
[1:31:11] there are some things I'll bring to you
[1:31:17] that's the reason why God choose
[1:31:21] to help us to understand
[1:31:24] he choose to take on a body
[1:31:27] and dress himself in flesh
[1:31:30] praise the Lord
[1:31:32] and he says Foxes have holds the birds
[1:31:36] have Nets but the son of man the creator
[1:31:39] of Heaven and Earth have nowhere to lay
[1:31:42] his head
[1:31:46] praise the Lord
[1:31:48] he borrowed a womb to be born
[1:31:51] and borrow a grave to be buried
[1:32:07] oh man
[1:32:11] Lord we need your help amen
[1:32:14] need the help of the Lord
[1:32:18] needed help of the Lord now
[1:32:21] uh
[1:32:23] uh where am I
[1:32:27] yeah so I mean uh so the uh the Lord
[1:32:30] called these two witnesses
[1:32:33] in Revelation chapter 11 even though
[1:32:36] they are names
[1:32:37] and that and that in Revelation chapter
[1:32:40] 11 but God identified uh uh a
[1:32:45] characteristics that goes with their
[1:32:47] Ministry
[1:32:48] and and based on that that's how we we
[1:32:52] have we have determined that is the
[1:32:55] ministry of Moses and Elijah
[1:32:58] praise the Lord
[1:33:01] now if you look at it in the Bible you
[1:33:04] if you read the entire uh Revelation
[1:33:07] chapter 11
[1:33:09] it will establish
[1:33:11] it will establish
[1:33:16] it will established year
[1:33:18] the Bible talks about these two men
[1:33:22] and uh
[1:33:25] verse 6
[1:33:27] Revelation chapter 11 these have power
[1:33:29] to shut the heavens that we saw in
[1:33:32] Elijah Ministry he shot the heavens for
[1:33:35] how long
[1:33:37] three and a half years so we're seeing
[1:33:40] the same three and a half years identify
[1:33:42] a year with uh with the uh
[1:33:46] wow
[1:33:47] the tribulation period
[1:33:49] so they have power to shut the heavens
[1:33:52] that they will not rain
[1:33:55] in the days of their prophecy and they
[1:33:57] have power to turn Waters into blood and
[1:34:01] that we saw on the Moses Ministry
[1:34:03] in Egypt
[1:34:05] praise the Lord now so with that in mind
[1:34:09] we we
[1:34:10] identify that these two men that are
[1:34:14] called the two Olive Tree and the two uh
[1:34:21] candlestick
[1:34:23] Moses and Elijah
[1:34:25] now if you really look at it you think
[1:34:28] about it you see it's uh
[1:34:30] Moses and Elijah you see that
[1:34:33] Moses wrote the five
[1:34:38] first book of the Bible
[1:34:40] and that five books makes the Jewish
[1:34:43] Torah
[1:34:45] the Torah is the five books of Moses
[1:34:49] that's what is called the Torah
[1:34:52] Moses wrote the first five book of the
[1:34:55] Bible and it makes the Jewish Torah
[1:35:00] and Elijah
[1:35:03] never wrote a book
[1:35:05] praise the Lord
[1:35:07] but the anointing the spirit that was on
[1:35:11] Elijah
[1:35:12] was used five times
[1:35:15] just like how Moses wrote five books
[1:35:24] praise the Lord
[1:35:26] amen
[1:35:33] so
[1:35:34] God has a reason
[1:35:38] he has a reason I thought because we
[1:35:41] didn't have a uh you know service on
[1:35:44] Wednesday we're just going to put two
[1:35:46] service into one
[1:35:49] so I thought you know referees are going
[1:35:51] to take a little time to greet you and
[1:35:52] then I'll come in to come behind again
[1:35:55] and preach another
[1:35:57] two hours
[1:36:03] praise the Lord
[1:36:14] praise the Lord
[1:36:16] yeah but I I prayed I won't keep you
[1:36:19] longer
[1:36:20] and uh so when you look at it you look
[1:36:23] at it let's let's look at uh some uh
[1:36:26] some scripture quickly Matthew chapter 5
[1:36:29] verse 7 I wish I just took these things
[1:36:32] and put him in the notes I just put the
[1:36:34] verses up there Matthew chapter 5 verse
[1:36:38] 7. now all of these scriptures that I'm
[1:36:40] going to call there are some that we
[1:36:42] might read but what I want you to look
[1:36:46] at uh
[1:36:48] 17 sorry 17 that's 17 not seven
[1:36:53] it looks like if I wear these glasses it
[1:36:55] would be better
[1:36:56] Matthew chapter 5 verse seven one what I
[1:37:00] want you to notice in these verses is
[1:37:03] the Lord
[1:37:04] and the prophets
[1:37:07] okay that's what I want you to notice in
[1:37:10] these verses I'm going to call the Lord
[1:37:13] and the prophets the law
[1:37:16] and the prophet sum up the entire
[1:37:21] Old Testament
[1:37:24] praise the Lord
[1:37:25] is sum up the entire Old Testament so
[1:37:28] before we go through this let's read our
[1:37:31] second chapter I called it and we never
[1:37:33] did it Matthew chapter 17.
[1:37:37] I said Matthew chapter 17 and then I
[1:37:39] went on talking so let's read that and
[1:37:42] then uh we will we can be able to to
[1:37:47] Matthew chapter 17 verse 1 after six
[1:37:50] days so this was the seventh day
[1:37:53] after six days so this day that this
[1:37:57] even happened was the seventh day
[1:38:00] praise the Lord
[1:38:02] [Music]
[1:38:06] and after six days Jesus taking Peter
[1:38:09] James and John his brother and and
[1:38:12] bringeth them up into an high mountain
[1:38:15] apart
[1:38:17] and was transfigured before them and his
[1:38:20] face did shine as the sun in his remit
[1:38:24] was as white as the light and behold
[1:38:27] there appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[1:38:32] which means Elijah talking with him
[1:38:37] and uh then Peter answered and and said
[1:38:42] unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be
[1:38:44] here
[1:38:46] if thou will let us make year three
[1:38:51] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[1:38:55] one for Elijah
[1:38:57] why he yet speak Behold a bright Cloud
[1:39:01] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[1:39:04] of the cloud we said this is my beloved
[1:39:08] Son in whom I'm well pleased yeah yeah
[1:39:11] him praise the Lord
[1:39:14] now so uh I can now go back to those
[1:39:17] scriptures on the laws and the prophets
[1:39:20] but here we see that this is uh uh what
[1:39:23] is called uh the mounts transfigure
[1:39:28] Mass Transfiguration uh uh
[1:39:33] experience Jesus taking these these men
[1:39:37] uh and then bringing them to this place
[1:39:40] and here they are they are experiencing
[1:39:42] uh there is something that is that is
[1:39:45] that is important about this if you want
[1:39:48] to have the time to go and set it on it
[1:39:51] you will realize that this particular
[1:39:53] Mountain where they are on is is because
[1:39:57] of the experience is called you know man
[1:40:00] Transfiguration but that's not the name
[1:40:02] of the mountain if you go back and real
[1:40:05] estate it I can give you give you some
[1:40:07] Bible reference on that you will realize
[1:40:09] that it was on this very same Mountain
[1:40:12] those two prophets had their last
[1:40:15] experience
[1:40:20] over in the book of Deuteronomy is
[1:40:23] called Mount Nimble you go in the book
[1:40:26] of King it's called Pisgah
[1:40:31] Moses went down that mountain and Elijah
[1:40:36] was taken off from uh uh uh from
[1:40:42] the feet of Mount Pisgah now that that
[1:40:45] is just that is just uh
[1:40:48] information I don't want to I'm already
[1:40:51] nervous here so
[1:40:53] now so you look at Matthew 5 17
[1:40:57] and uh Jesus there talks about
[1:41:01] uh I've not come to destroy the laws and
[1:41:04] the prophets
[1:41:06] but I've come to fulfill them
[1:41:09] praise the Lord
[1:41:10] he said you not come to destroy the Lord
[1:41:12] and the prophets but to fulfill you look
[1:41:15] over in Matthew chapter 7 verse 12
[1:41:19] that's where he also gave what is called
[1:41:22] the Golden Rule do unto men as you will
[1:41:25] want them to do unto you
[1:41:28] so says the Lord and the prophets
[1:41:31] that's what he said in Matthew chapter 7
[1:41:35] verse 12 Matthew chapter 11
[1:41:40] verse 13 let's read that one
[1:41:44] Matthew 11.
[1:41:47] verse 13.
[1:41:54] now yeah he's talking about uh uh the
[1:41:59] ministry of John the Baptist
[1:42:02] and uh
[1:42:11] verse 11 for uh 11 11 chapter 11 verily
[1:42:16] I say unto you among them that are born
[1:42:18] born of women there have not raising a
[1:42:22] greater than John the Baptist
[1:42:24] now we're standing here that is least in
[1:42:27] the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he
[1:42:30] and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:42:33] until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffer
[1:42:35] violence and the violence taken about
[1:42:37] false now yeah this is what I want you
[1:42:39] to pay attention to for all the prophets
[1:42:42] and the Lord prophesied until John now
[1:42:48] what what is what is pointing to here in
[1:42:51] this verse is that John the Baptist
[1:42:53] ministry closed the Old Testament
[1:42:56] the Old Testament did not close by
[1:42:59] Malachi the Old Testament closed by John
[1:43:01] because John was a breach
[1:43:06] praise the Lord
[1:43:08] John was a bridge
[1:43:10] now so what what is is important year is
[1:43:17] the other thank you for them what is
[1:43:20] important here is that the the
[1:43:24] Moses Ministry
[1:43:29] represent the Lord
[1:43:31] because he was the one that gives out
[1:43:34] the Lord
[1:43:35] amen
[1:43:37] Elijah Ministry represent the ministry
[1:43:41] of the prophets
[1:43:44] what was the importance of Elijah's
[1:43:47] Ministry
[1:43:48] to bring the people back to the law
[1:43:52] that's what Elijah came to do
[1:43:56] Israel has forsaken the Lord of God they
[1:43:59] have gone into idolatry and here was a
[1:44:03] man that was going to bring he built 12
[1:44:05] Stones put 12 Stones back together and
[1:44:07] said Lord let it be this that would turn
[1:44:10] the house of the people back to you
[1:44:15] praise the Lord
[1:44:17] amen
[1:44:18] we are looking at the two Olive Tree and
[1:44:22] the two Candlestick we will get to that
[1:44:24] in Zacharias but I'm trying to lay the
[1:44:27] foundation here so you can see why why
[1:44:30] God
[1:44:32] raised these two men and if you even
[1:44:34] look at their lives look at their lives
[1:44:37] Moses was born in a time of trouble
[1:44:42] praise the Lord he was born in a time of
[1:44:45] trouble and it almost looks like the
[1:44:47] ministry were interrupted
[1:44:52] that's the way that we from the natural
[1:44:55] will see it but with God it was a
[1:44:57] hundred percent
[1:44:59] praise the Lord
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:03] Elijah came on the same we don't have no
[1:45:05] history about his childhood
[1:45:10] but he came right in a time of trouble
[1:45:14] when Israel has gone completely into
[1:45:17] idolatry
[1:45:19] Ahab got married to Jesse bioshi she was
[1:45:22] a a princess of a hidden King and she
[1:45:26] was bringing that influence into Israel
[1:45:34] praise the Lord
[1:45:37] are we together
[1:45:40] now so yeah the uh uh Matthew chapter 22
[1:45:45] let's look at that also
[1:45:51] just keep looking at these laws and the
[1:45:53] prophets
[1:46:01] because if you understand that you will
[1:46:04] realize all of these people that look
[1:46:07] for
[1:46:08] for praises
[1:46:10] you know Paul want us now to be i7s
[1:46:14] you know because an i7 does not it does
[1:46:17] not play in the in the Plan of
[1:46:19] Redemption
[1:46:21] you are used but you are not the one
[1:46:22] that's supposed to be seen
[1:46:25] Jesus says do this work let your father
[1:46:27] be glorified
[1:46:30] that's what Redemption is
[1:46:32] so if you are looking for Praises you
[1:46:35] are looking for uh self-esteem and you
[1:46:37] you are not you don't fit into God's
[1:46:39] Plan of Redemption
[1:46:42] you don't fit into God's Plan of
[1:46:44] Redemption
[1:46:52] Matthew chapter 22.
[1:46:59] verse 37.
[1:47:14] Jesus here he's going to sum up some of
[1:47:17] the the the entire
[1:47:22] how you call it now let's go into some
[1:47:24] of the entire Commandments
[1:47:31] 37 22 37 Jesus said unto them thou shall
[1:47:35] love the Lord Thy Thy God with all the
[1:47:38] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[1:47:41] thy mind
[1:47:42] this is the first and the the great
[1:47:45] commitment the second is likely the the
[1:47:49] second is like unto it thou shall love
[1:47:51] thy neighbor as thyself amen praise the
[1:47:55] Lord
[1:47:56] if you look at the whole Ten
[1:47:58] Commandments it's just around there do
[1:48:00] not commit adultery if you love your
[1:48:02] neighbor you will not run after his wife
[1:48:04] do not convert if you love your neighbor
[1:48:06] you will not do so it's just that's what
[1:48:08] Jesus is saying is just around that
[1:48:17] and he says here on these two
[1:48:20] Commandments thank the Lord and the
[1:48:24] prophets
[1:48:26] amen so everything that is Place
[1:48:30] everything that is placed in the
[1:48:34] in the uh in the Old Testament he says
[1:48:37] on these two Commandments hang the Lord
[1:48:40] and the prophets
[1:48:43] now another one that is also beautiful
[1:48:45] for you to see this Romans 3
[1:48:50] Romans 3 let's read that and we will
[1:48:52] take up there there are a lot of them
[1:48:54] there
[1:48:55] but uh this this will set us up
[1:49:00] and like I said I prayed I wouldn't take
[1:49:02] much of your time we can continue in
[1:49:05] another time
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:12] praise the Lord
[1:49:22] you know what uh one one brother was
[1:49:25] saying this morning I was following that
[1:49:27] uh memorial service he said uh he said
[1:49:30] the sixth Dimension is becoming
[1:49:32] interesting
[1:49:36] he says well all of these guys go on the
[1:49:39] sixth Dimension is becoming interesting
[1:49:43] I said Raymond Thompson
[1:49:48] Romans chapter 3
[1:49:51] . Let's uh let's look at verse 20.
[1:49:55] Paul says here therefore that these of
[1:49:58] the Lord he says therefore by the Deeds
[1:50:00] of the Lord shall no flesh be justified
[1:50:04] in his sight in God's sight
[1:50:07] for by the Lord is the knowledge of sin
[1:50:11] wash this now but now the righteousness
[1:50:14] of God
[1:50:15] without the Lord is manifested
[1:50:20] being Witness
[1:50:24] being witness so which means the laws
[1:50:28] and the prophets testify of God's
[1:50:31] righteousness that's the reason why we
[1:50:33] could go back in Genesis and take the
[1:50:36] life of Fatima
[1:50:39] when Judah said thou are more righteous
[1:50:42] than I we can take their life of tema in
[1:50:46] the Old Testament because why is
[1:50:49] standing as a witness of God's
[1:50:51] righteousness that God's righteousness
[1:50:54] was not after the day because after the
[1:50:57] day you were condemned tema
[1:51:00] how can she disguise herself as a harlot
[1:51:04] and trap her father in law but if you
[1:51:08] look in the deeper thoughts she wanted
[1:51:11] to be identified with the promise
[1:51:16] so yeah Paul is saying that the law and
[1:51:20] the prophets that we call the Old
[1:51:23] Testament is a witness to God's
[1:51:26] righteousness
[1:51:30] praise the Lord
[1:51:33] to his righteousness without the Lord
[1:51:38] do you understand that
[1:51:41] no I got to read it again I don't think
[1:51:42] you understand it
[1:51:44] I don't think you understand it
[1:51:48] praise the Lord
[1:51:49] amen
[1:51:53] no flesh is Justified
[1:51:56] by the Lord
[1:51:58] amen
[1:51:59] now but now verse 21
[1:52:04] the righteousness of God without the law
[1:52:10] praise the Lord
[1:52:11] the righteousness of God without the
[1:52:14] Lord
[1:52:15] so without the Lord
[1:52:18] even before the Lord came into being
[1:52:22] God
[1:52:23] has was always a righteous God
[1:52:28] amen even before there was a lord
[1:52:32] that's the reason why
[1:52:34] you cannot you cannot be legalistic
[1:52:38] and be justified by Lord because the the
[1:52:42] righteousness of God was before the Lord
[1:52:46] but he says here
[1:52:48] but now the righteousness of God without
[1:52:51] the Lord is manifested being witnessed
[1:52:54] by the Lord
[1:52:58] that's what I want you to understand the
[1:53:00] righteousness without the Lord
[1:53:02] yet the law and the prophets
[1:53:06] stand as a witness
[1:53:09] to that righteousness without the Lord
[1:53:16] amen praise the Lord
[1:53:20] amen
[1:53:23] that's the reason why you can find this
[1:53:27] kind of scenarios in the Bible
[1:53:29] when when when uh when Moses
[1:53:33] will preach and says they are the uh uh
[1:53:37] he will blast against and and and and
[1:53:39] and condemn more up
[1:53:42] and we know the history of the people
[1:53:44] tomorrow there was lots and his two
[1:53:47] daughters you know those those kind of
[1:53:49] for ugly sins
[1:53:51] I mean it blowed the minds of the
[1:53:54] infeeder
[1:53:56] how can how can you call this Bible a
[1:53:59] sacred book and it has those kind of
[1:54:02] accounts in it why because God is the
[1:54:05] god of Truth
[1:54:08] praise the Lord
[1:54:10] he just did not hide all the the ugly
[1:54:13] story and just bring out good stories
[1:54:19] praise the Lord
[1:54:20] amen now so what good could come out of
[1:54:24] that
[1:54:26] one gold could come out of lots and his
[1:54:30] daughters
[1:54:31] but yet that will be the very place
[1:54:33] where the best story of redemption is
[1:54:37] ever plain in the Bible
[1:54:41] praise the Lord so you see you when you
[1:54:44] read the story of Ruth
[1:54:47] you know every time I read a story in my
[1:54:50] mind I'm thinking the nearest man the
[1:54:53] man that was the nearest Kingsman
[1:54:55] the only reason why he refused to redeem
[1:54:59] Naomi was because of Ruth
[1:55:03] he could not stand the thought
[1:55:06] of a moabite
[1:55:10] praise the Lord
[1:55:11] amen if you don't know the Jews you have
[1:55:13] to know them
[1:55:15] you he will not stand the thought of and
[1:55:18] more about
[1:55:19] but you see how God in his great wisdom
[1:55:24] allowed there to be their way
[1:55:27] because Boaz was the man that was
[1:55:30] ordained
[1:55:34] to take off his shoes kick it in the
[1:55:37] head
[1:55:39] praise the Lord in a mess of
[1:55:42] everything that was said
[1:55:47] glory be to God
[1:55:55] so that's why Paul is saying here the
[1:55:57] righteousness of God
[1:55:59] was manifested
[1:56:02] and the Lord and the prophet stand as a
[1:56:05] witness and said that is truth
[1:56:09] so the scriptures think the very same
[1:56:12] scripture that says
[1:56:16] no Abomination we entered into the
[1:56:20] congregation of the Lord
[1:56:22] that seems structure stance and say Amen
[1:56:25] when Boaz took roof
[1:56:30] praise the Lord
[1:56:31] amen
[1:56:33] now you look at Aaron and and and and uh
[1:56:37] uh uh and and his sister Miriam arguing
[1:56:42] against Moses because of the wife that
[1:56:44] he married
[1:56:45] praise the Lord and when Moses was the
[1:56:48] same one that preached to them and told
[1:56:50] them because don't marry no strangers
[1:56:52] praise the Lord
[1:56:54] but yet the righteousness of God without
[1:56:57] the Lord
[1:57:01] amen the law of God the Lord and the
[1:57:05] prophet the Lord and the Commandment
[1:57:08] for their hands and still say Amen
[1:57:12] to Moses
[1:57:16] that God never came on the scene and
[1:57:18] said Moses you are your your brother and
[1:57:20] your sister are right
[1:57:23] no
[1:57:25] God says that's my seven
[1:57:30] amen
[1:57:31] if I would talk to any man I speak to
[1:57:34] them through dreams and vision but Moses
[1:57:37] is not like that
[1:57:39] we sit down and talk face to face
[1:57:44] [Music]
[1:57:46] The Lord Is Thy favoritism no is the
[1:57:50] righteousness of God without the Lord
[1:57:58] the law of God will say Amen
[1:58:06] Hallelujah
[1:58:09] so the Lord and the prophets stand as a
[1:58:13] witness
[1:58:14] that's the reason why Paul could said in
[1:58:16] Hebrew that the Lord is a shadow
[1:58:20] because when your Shadow is on the wall
[1:58:22] is serving as a witness we don't know if
[1:58:24] it's a man or woman but we know somebody
[1:58:26] coming
[1:58:28] until you start coming closer
[1:58:31] praise the Lord now they're all dressed
[1:58:33] the same but we will start we start
[1:58:35] picturing in our mind and walking yeah I
[1:58:37] think he's walking like a lady I think
[1:58:39] that's a lady there
[1:58:40] praise the Lord
[1:58:42] and then when you come closer then we
[1:58:44] see the picture so that is what Paul is
[1:58:47] saying here that the Lord and the
[1:58:50] prophet serve as a witness so you go
[1:58:53] through the entire uh uh uh Bible you
[1:58:57] will realize that and the reason why I'm
[1:58:59] doing this like I said I'm establishing
[1:59:01] the fact why the scripture point to
[1:59:04] these two men
[1:59:09] as the two olive tree
[1:59:13] praise the Lord
[1:59:15] and the two
[1:59:17] candlestick
[1:59:20] Jesus said wherever
[1:59:23] two or three I gather
[1:59:26] I will be there
[1:59:28] in the Amish
[1:59:33] he says Genesis
[1:59:35] 1 26 let's let us make man in our image
[1:59:44] and when God made man
[1:59:47] he make man male and female
[1:59:52] praise the Lord
[1:59:53] God worshiped that principle
[1:59:58] he works with the principal
[2:00:01] of two if two
[2:00:02] were agreed upon anything
[2:00:07] it's a principle it's a rule of law with
[2:00:10] God
[2:00:12] are we together
[2:00:16] amen
[2:00:17] so all of these things were
[2:00:22] you know people struggled in their mind
[2:00:24] to make themselves a a special one and
[2:00:27] you know and all of that you are just
[2:00:29] you are just helling down the wrong way
[2:00:31] for a crutch
[2:00:35] you will never be able to bring out
[2:00:39] a perfect picture of redemption
[2:00:42] or you would never even be able to
[2:00:44] understand your purpose of life until
[2:00:48] you have been able to identify
[2:00:50] your companion
[2:00:54] because everything that God set it out
[2:00:56] that way
[2:00:58] he said it out he lay it out
[2:01:03] a place are both in creation
[2:01:05] and in Redemption
[2:01:07] that's why the moon reflects the light
[2:01:10] of the Sun
[2:01:16] he lay it out that way
[2:01:20] and you see it is it is all fall his
[2:01:23] doing is for his Beauty
[2:01:26] praise the Lord
[2:01:29] sin just take
[2:01:32] as ticket selfish nature to man
[2:01:36] and all we think is just our self
[2:01:40] praise the Lord amen we just we just get
[2:01:43] so consumed in ourselves
[2:01:47] and in that way there is no way you can
[2:01:49] be able to bring out God's purpose for
[2:01:52] your life
[2:02:00] Jesus says you have not chosen me and I
[2:02:03] have chosen you
[2:02:05] praise the Lord
[2:02:07] I have chosen you and he choose us
[2:02:10] choose the disciples
[2:02:12] to be able to work out his plane of
[2:02:14] redemption amen
[2:02:16] so uh
[2:02:17] [Music]
[2:02:19] we we travel in this way
[2:02:22] just want you to
[2:02:25] as we look at all of these things
[2:02:27] together so yeah we see here that uh
[2:02:30] Zacharias chapter four you go to
[2:02:32] zechariah's chapter four you will see uh
[2:02:35] the prophet Zacharias talking about two
[2:02:37] olive tree
[2:02:39] and uh let's go to Malachi 4.
[2:02:44] let's go to Malachi 4.
[2:02:50] let's go to Malachi chapter four
[2:02:55] we love to read that
[2:02:59] about the Elijah Ministry
[2:03:04] praise the Lord
[2:03:07] you love to read that
[2:03:09] and we read Malachi chapter 4 verse 5
[2:03:12] but if you look at verse 4
[2:03:15] what the scripture says remember ye the
[2:03:18] law of Moses my seven
[2:03:20] so write in the promise of Malachi
[2:03:23] chapter 4
[2:03:25] yet the Moses Ministry also stands out
[2:03:30] amen because Elijah don't have a
[2:03:33] Ministry unless he have what he's
[2:03:35] restoring the people back to
[2:03:41] praise the Lord so you see that's the
[2:03:43] reason why uh uh for the coming Elijah
[2:03:47] Ministry almighty God comes right there
[2:03:50] and says remember here the law of Moses
[2:03:53] my seven wish I commanded him in her
[2:03:56] what was that the Ten Commandments
[2:03:59] that was the law of God that was the
[2:04:01] Torah
[2:04:06] so yet God keep carrying these two
[2:04:10] Ministries
[2:04:12] because we need the word and the spirit
[2:04:18] that's what Jesus said in Saint John
[2:04:20] chapter 4.
[2:04:25] praise the Lord
[2:04:28] if you just had the word you you are
[2:04:31] just intellectual
[2:04:34] praise the Lord
[2:04:36] amen
[2:04:38] and if you have the spirit without the
[2:04:41] principle of the word you're just going
[2:04:43] to make a very poor poor example of a
[2:04:48] Christian
[2:04:50] praise the Lord
[2:04:51] you be one of these ones on a flowering
[2:04:53] plane that said Jesus said I should open
[2:04:55] the plain door
[2:04:59] praise the Lord
[2:05:01] if the Lord want to take you he don't
[2:05:03] need to damage the life of the rest of
[2:05:05] the other people
[2:05:07] amen he can pick you up you can
[2:05:10] disappear from on that plane nobody will
[2:05:12] know
[2:05:20] so that that is the balance
[2:05:24] that is the balance
[2:05:35] are we together
[2:05:38] foreign
[2:05:46] it is not just word word word
[2:05:51] and you don't have the life to back it
[2:05:53] up
[2:05:57] praise the Lord
[2:06:00] you don't have the life to back it up
[2:06:02] they have to be the life it counts by
[2:06:03] the birth of the Spirit by one Spirit we
[2:06:06] are all baptized into one body
[2:06:15] so you see it you can go back to the
[2:06:17] life of these two men
[2:06:19] a little bit here
[2:06:22] praise the Lord
[2:06:27] because there is uh
[2:06:31] there is a very
[2:06:34] tremendous in the book of Jude let's
[2:06:36] look in the book of Jude it's already
[2:06:38] one o'clock here so I try to find a
[2:06:41] place to close
[2:06:46] foreign
[2:06:52] the book of Jude verse 9 that's one
[2:06:55] chapter
[2:06:56] verse 9 yet Micah the arc angel
[2:06:59] when contending with the devil he
[2:07:02] disputed about the body of Moses
[2:07:06] praise the Lord
[2:07:08] this is the only place in the entire
[2:07:10] Bible where we have this account
[2:07:13] but let's go to the book of Deuteronomy
[2:07:15] and see how Moses
[2:07:17] left the scene
[2:07:36] praise the Lord
[2:07:46] can you think about it uh
[2:07:51] young people
[2:07:53] this man Moses
[2:07:55] the the kind of for opportunity there
[2:07:58] Paul speaks in the book of uh
[2:08:00] [Music]
[2:08:02] in the book of
[2:08:05] Hebrew 11.
[2:08:08] that Moses forsook the pleasure of Egypt
[2:08:13] praise the Lord
[2:08:15] he forsook the pleasure of Egypt Stephen
[2:08:17] brought out a beautiful thing in in the
[2:08:20] book of Acts I will show it to you
[2:08:21] another time not today because uh it
[2:08:24] would just it would just uh
[2:08:27] it would take us through another thing
[2:08:29] but there was a reason why uh uh Ramsay
[2:08:34] was very angry against Moses
[2:08:39] you have to realize this this word of
[2:08:42] taking on great Nations civilization
[2:08:45] like many of us have done it did not
[2:08:48] start it now
[2:08:49] even the great Apostle Paul
[2:08:52] he he was a citizen of Rome not by birth
[2:09:02] because of his because of his father so
[2:09:05] Paul had a Roman citizenship and then he
[2:09:09] threatened the the praising God and says
[2:09:11] are you going to persecute a Roman
[2:09:13] and when he came to father that he was
[2:09:16] he had a citizenship a room to push back
[2:09:18] a little bit
[2:09:20] so even in in ancient time
[2:09:23] Moses became an Egyptian because
[2:09:27] the the the the the Pharaoh daughter
[2:09:29] adopted him
[2:09:32] praise the Lord
[2:09:34] so that's that's another one I'm going
[2:09:36] to I'm just going to leave you right
[2:09:38] there
[2:09:39] but he had this privilege
[2:09:42] to become the next pharaoh
[2:09:47] praise the Lord because the Pharaoh that
[2:09:51] was on the throne that pursued after
[2:09:53] Moses was younger than him
[2:09:58] they all grewed right in the palace
[2:10:02] if you study the book of Arts carefully
[2:10:05] that Pharaoh was also adopted he was not
[2:10:08] an Egyptian
[2:10:18] so
[2:10:20] I I say I was hanging you there but then
[2:10:22] I let you go
[2:10:27] praise the Lord but I'll leave that for
[2:10:29] your assignment
[2:10:33] and uh so but but Moses how all this
[2:10:37] privilege
[2:10:38] that he had
[2:10:40] praise the Lord
[2:10:41] you could think that
[2:10:43] it would have even been an easier way if
[2:10:46] you have just choose to stay become the
[2:10:49] Pharaoh and tell the people your goal
[2:10:54] but you see God purpose don't work like
[2:10:57] that
[2:11:01] as chapter 7 the bible say it came to
[2:11:04] his heart
[2:11:06] which means Moses heart was burning
[2:11:09] he was trouble
[2:11:11] he couldn't sleep
[2:11:15] he came to his heart
[2:11:21] amen that's what the Plan of Redemption
[2:11:24] will do
[2:11:26] it will make you it will give you
[2:11:28] sleepless night for others
[2:11:30] if you are having Sleepless now for
[2:11:32] yourself yeah there's a problem
[2:11:36] that you either be you are having
[2:11:38] Sleepless now because you're saying God
[2:11:40] I need more of you
[2:11:42] oh God deliver me
[2:11:45] but not Sleepless now why I don't have
[2:11:47] money why my life is like this why my
[2:11:49] life is like that
[2:11:55] praise the Lord
[2:11:58] that God purpose will smash him
[2:12:04] from what you would call success
[2:12:08] it was snatching from that place
[2:12:11] create a rage in his heart he would go
[2:12:14] and kill an Egyptian
[2:12:15] and live in
[2:12:18] living the best of bed
[2:12:21] living the best of food and going to the
[2:12:24] wilderness
[2:12:25] where he don't know
[2:12:27] where his future is
[2:12:34] Redemption will rob you
[2:12:37] of your selfish nature
[2:12:40] and make you a seven
[2:12:42] [Music]
[2:12:44] that's why Redemption will do to you
[2:12:47] all these people that go to all of these
[2:12:49] prosperity meetings they want to be
[2:12:52] there it's just all about themselves
[2:12:53] they want to prosper they want to they
[2:12:55] just want money in their own wealth and
[2:12:57] all of that
[2:12:58] you can find Christ in that
[2:13:01] because there is no testimony from the
[2:13:05] laws and the prophets
[2:13:07] the laws and the prophets don't witness
[2:13:09] to that
[2:13:14] praise the Lord
[2:13:19] that he'll go in the wilderness and all
[2:13:21] of that and and then after that God will
[2:13:23] meet him Exodus chapter 3.
[2:13:26] and say go back to Egypt
[2:13:29] he will come back and the Very people he
[2:13:31] came to deliver
[2:13:33] they will withstand him to his face
[2:13:37] praise the Lord the very people after he
[2:13:41] have gone
[2:13:42] and I spent 40 years there
[2:13:45] believing to himself that he have
[2:13:47] settled down
[2:13:49] now look at my years now
[2:13:51] I think it's okay for me
[2:13:53] praise the Lord Egypt has gone from my
[2:13:56] mind
[2:13:57] he gave his little part-time job pushing
[2:14:00] ships around
[2:14:02] praise the Lord he had lost all his
[2:14:05] friends trying to take that from his
[2:14:07] mind
[2:14:09] God will meet him in the burning bush
[2:14:11] and give him a commission to go right
[2:14:13] back to the place where he run away from
[2:14:17] [Music]
[2:14:19] go back to the responsibility that you
[2:14:22] are running from
[2:14:26] praise the Lord he would he would he
[2:14:29] would pick up courage
[2:14:30] and try to go back and get back there
[2:14:33] hoping that the people will Embrace him
[2:14:37] they will send him right to his face you
[2:14:40] run away prophet
[2:14:44] praise the Lord
[2:14:45] and then he got back and now so to to
[2:14:48] Pharaoh let my people go both of them
[2:14:51] knew one another
[2:14:52] so when Moses entered the palace it was
[2:14:54] not a strange thing
[2:14:56] praise the Lord
[2:14:57] amen that's that's that's some of the
[2:15:00] reason why that Pharaoh was stubborn
[2:15:06] let my people go
[2:15:09] and then right after that again the the
[2:15:11] the the the the punishment of the
[2:15:13] Hebrews increase nor straw you are made
[2:15:16] breaks everybody oh what while the guy
[2:15:18] came back for now he come back we get
[2:15:20] trouble all right
[2:15:23] instead of the people held him
[2:15:28] praise the Lord everybody started
[2:15:30] looking at him with another eye
[2:15:35] praise the Lord
[2:15:38] God Rob him of his little life his
[2:15:41] little home that he have
[2:15:46] praise the Lord
[2:15:50] and that's the reason why this struggle
[2:15:53] even with the opening of the Red Sea
[2:15:56] right after the cross they started
[2:15:58] complaining you brought us here to chaos
[2:16:03] praise the Lord is the complaining of
[2:16:06] the people
[2:16:08] is the complaining
[2:16:10] people you don't know and I will let you
[2:16:12] know
[2:16:14] amen
[2:16:15] how the actions of the people
[2:16:20] it's easy to send the preacher to his
[2:16:22] grave
[2:16:27] the action of the people
[2:16:31] listening to something that a little
[2:16:35] book that is called the devil sales and
[2:16:37] I have to read that and preach a message
[2:16:40] Satan is on the cell
[2:16:42] he's having a garage sale the same way
[2:16:44] you do garage sale
[2:16:45] so you don't have a garage sale
[2:16:48] his most pressures
[2:16:51] product he sell is discouragement
[2:16:57] that his most precious you know what he
[2:17:00] put on it not for sale
[2:17:03] he's just having it there but he put now
[2:17:05] for sale
[2:17:06] because as long as he can keep it he
[2:17:08] will stay in business
[2:17:13] as long as he can keep it he will stay
[2:17:16] in business
[2:17:24] praise the Lord thinking about all of
[2:17:26] these brothers
[2:17:29] or just they are following that service
[2:17:32] this morning Mama I was just thinking
[2:17:34] what would become of that church
[2:17:38] what would become of that church
[2:17:41] no doubt there are people that are
[2:17:42] sitting there they are planning their
[2:17:44] plots if I'm not the minister I'm going
[2:17:46] to quit I'm going to split this church
[2:17:48] I'm going to have my own in it I'm just
[2:17:51] sitting there I'm thinking in my mind
[2:17:52] what will happen to this church
[2:18:03] praise the Lord
[2:18:06] and I can help and think what will
[2:18:08] happen to our group if the people have
[2:18:11] not grabbed the vision of what we want
[2:18:13] to achieve here
[2:18:19] that's why you don't understand
[2:18:21] that's what you don't understand
[2:18:23] God don't give it to everybody he give
[2:18:25] it to one man yes that's that's his
[2:18:28] choice
[2:18:38] the very people that God says I will
[2:18:40] wrap these people out and start another
[2:18:42] generation Moses says don't do it
[2:18:44] he said God don't do it
[2:18:48] if you do it what would the nation says
[2:18:52] the very people he pleaded for were the
[2:18:55] same people that caused him not to see
[2:18:57] the promised land God have to take him
[2:19:00] off the Earth
[2:19:04] because of the attitude of ungrateful
[2:19:06] people
[2:19:15] the very same people that Elijah was
[2:19:18] sent
[2:19:19] they have been so glued into idolatry
[2:19:24] they have built Temple for bars all over
[2:19:26] the place he was sent to bring their
[2:19:28] heart back to the to the Lord of God
[2:19:31] challenge the prophets of God on my
[2:19:34] camera
[2:19:36] it was not done behind the curtains
[2:19:39] everybody everybody was called to come
[2:19:41] and Witness
[2:19:45] if God is God that he sent fire from
[2:19:48] heaven and consume your sacrifice
[2:19:52] praise the Lord
[2:19:55] all of that they did turn away no
[2:20:00] no
[2:20:01] the increase in their idolatry
[2:20:12] I'll tell Elijah had to run for his life
[2:20:18] he had to run for his life
[2:20:27] praise the Lord
[2:20:37] like I always say
[2:20:42] you labor for the people there are your
[2:20:45] whole life
[2:20:46] you are half
[2:20:49] the day they hear something about you
[2:20:51] that they don't know or they don't like
[2:20:54] whole Pastor that when you become whole
[2:20:58] you are whole when they can find your
[2:21:00] weakness
[2:21:03] but you will be killing yourself for
[2:21:04] them you are half
[2:21:11] okay it sounds funny but it's not funny
[2:21:16] it's not funny it's because you people
[2:21:18] don't understand
[2:21:20] y'all don't understand
[2:21:22] y'all don't understand
[2:21:24] and it's not everything that the
[2:21:26] preacher tells you
[2:21:29] he don't tells you everything
[2:21:33] praise the Lord
[2:21:36] he don't tell you everything
[2:21:42] the time is fasting
[2:21:44] and just like I said
[2:21:49] I will hold you in these thoughts
[2:21:51] because there are things that I want to
[2:21:53] drive to with this subject
[2:21:56] and we now want to run after it but
[2:22:01] there's a reason why God
[2:22:04] took the life of these two men
[2:22:10] and uh
[2:22:15] you can see when Joshua
[2:22:18] after
[2:22:20] uh after the Moses
[2:22:27] he took the people into the promised
[2:22:29] land he distributed the Promised Land
[2:22:32] and uh
[2:22:35] God promised Joshua as ours with Moses
[2:22:38] so I will be with you
[2:22:41] praise the Lord
[2:22:44] and uh
[2:22:46] Elijah
[2:22:48] in order of his ministry
[2:22:50] he did only eight miracles
[2:22:54] Elijah upon whom his Spirit came
[2:22:58] that will be the second time that God
[2:23:00] will use the the spirit or the anointing
[2:23:05] of Elijah Elijah Elijah did 16 miracles
[2:23:12] it goes to show that
[2:23:17] Jesus said in his word The Works that I
[2:23:20] do
[2:23:22] shall you do even Greater Works
[2:23:27] we cannot do greater than our Lord
[2:23:31] it's just that when when you when you
[2:23:34] grab when God can get a people
[2:23:38] get an uh uh Joshua on the on the uh
[2:23:42] Moses Ministry it's just a continuation
[2:23:47] it's a continuation
[2:23:49] praise the Lord
[2:23:51] and then all the years of Labor will now
[2:23:54] be blessed
[2:23:56] all the things that Moses
[2:23:59] put in sea form
[2:24:02] they will now reap the Harvest
[2:24:07] if God can get an Elijah honor an Elijah
[2:24:10] Ministry
[2:24:11] he can be able to Smart the Jordan and
[2:24:14] find his way back
[2:24:17] he says where's the god of Elijah
[2:24:21] why because he have a double potion
[2:24:32] praise the Lord
[2:24:34] if Christ can get a bride that cracked
[2:24:37] the vision
[2:24:39] now the people that are trying to make
[2:24:41] names for themselves and build images
[2:24:43] for themselves and be Empires for
[2:24:45] themselves
[2:24:48] but people that grab the vision
[2:24:51] of redemption
[2:24:56] that's why Jesus says you are the salt
[2:24:59] the sword do not self itself a gift
[2:25:02] taste to others
[2:25:07] the song gave taste to others
[2:25:17] if your Christian Life is making
[2:25:20] the church
[2:25:22] making people to lose taste for God
[2:25:26] then there is something wrong with you
[2:25:29] something wrong with your experience
[2:25:34] amen
[2:25:35] you can only be in a good good mood at a
[2:25:38] certain time and and then you quick to
[2:25:40] Flap off the scene and say some sorts of
[2:25:42] things yeah yeah
[2:25:47] then you come back again
[2:25:49] praise the Lord
[2:25:50] that all the Christian Life well the
[2:25:52] spirit can't keep under control you can
[2:25:54] get in the flesh and get in the spirit
[2:26:05] you will enjoy
[2:26:07] your Christian Life
[2:26:09] when you understand
[2:26:11] that the purpose that God saved you
[2:26:14] is to make others
[2:26:17] testing
[2:26:19] is to make others to feel off of your
[2:26:22] life
[2:26:24] is for others to benefit
[2:26:27] is not to make you proudful
[2:26:31] to think that you are special
[2:26:32] untouchable
[2:26:35] see all of these uh people
[2:26:39] um anybody touch me the fire of God will
[2:26:41] consume them that
[2:26:47] when they're doing those things which
[2:26:48] means they're doing something that is
[2:26:49] not right
[2:26:51] their heart condemning instead of them
[2:26:52] to go and repent
[2:26:56] the church has made them arrogant
[2:27:13] the purpose of redemption
[2:27:15] see that song that comes up
[2:27:17] it comes to bring Warmness it does not
[2:27:19] serve itself
[2:27:21] come to bring Warmness to you
[2:27:30] musicians you can come
[2:27:32] like I said pray for me
[2:27:35] and these need God's help
[2:27:38] and uh
[2:27:54] we had a tribute to fenne Crosby
[2:27:59] there was a line in there
[2:28:01] we had uh brother Eric from South Africa
[2:28:04] preaching for us so I just couldn't go
[2:28:05] into that but I had a line in there that
[2:28:08] I wanted to address to my young people
[2:28:12] the ones online and the ones that I hear
[2:28:15] Fanny Crosby she she was a gifted lady
[2:28:20] that she never saw blindness as being
[2:28:23] handicapped
[2:28:24] she believed that blindness was God's
[2:28:26] gift to her
[2:28:28] to make her a blessing to the word
[2:28:31] but you'll realize with all of the perm
[2:28:33] that she wrote
[2:28:35] and the way that she touched the hearts
[2:28:37] of people
[2:28:39] she really never came to faith in Christ
[2:28:41] even though she was not living wrong
[2:28:46] she was not living wrong
[2:28:48] but she never came to faith in Christ
[2:28:53] until I think she was about 30 years 35.
[2:28:58] we are looking my notes Here
[2:29:01] the same thing with John Wesley
[2:29:05] taught honor a Godly mother
[2:29:09] how Susanna pray for her children and
[2:29:12] she taught them the Bible John and
[2:29:14] Charles became a gift to the word
[2:29:16] John the Baptist I mean John Wesley he
[2:29:19] was he was going on missionary trip even
[2:29:21] came to the America on his first journey
[2:29:24] and yet
[2:29:27] he had not come to faith in Christ
[2:29:36] he says so young people
[2:29:39] you have to go beyond
[2:29:42] the church atmosphere
[2:29:44] because you come to church every
[2:29:46] Wednesday you come to church every
[2:29:48] Sunday you know you're just like the
[2:29:51] Young Rich ruler he did everything you
[2:29:53] keep the Lord and all of that
[2:29:58] but when you have not have a birth
[2:30:01] experience
[2:30:03] don't fake it
