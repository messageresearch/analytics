makes everything praise the lord amen it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight and we will just take our prayer knees the lord bless you you can have your seat praise the lord i will just say some few things before we pray tonight it's going to be in the house of the lord and we want to thank the lord for his blessings upon us praise the lord [Music] amen and uh we want to thank the lord that was gracious to us on on sunday and uh for blessing us with his presence and the service we appreciate the lord for that there were a few things that i mean the lord himself just put in order to have the service go right because only him can bring it outright praise the lord and i was actually thinking on that message why it had to be shepherds remember i was speaking a few time in the weekend i talked something about the shepherds you know the shepherd king the the shepherd prophet you've seen that message brother branham said that so i will encourage you to listen out for that and see the way he plays some of those few things but that's what i was actually thinking for our christmas message and then on my way to church i heard that heard the technicians playing that message and i just thought wow i mean it's just it's just it's just the lord amen is just the lord praise the lord amen and i mean the lord just have a few things just to be able to to bless us and and make things come a right but i would love for us to play that message as they are playing it and and also you have time listening to it uh if we have the opportunity that's why we will speak on for our christmas message there are some few things i want to bring in light of what brother branham said in that message and and then also i want to encourage the church [Music] as we on the countdown to the end of this year i would just want us to [Music] take uh this time and the rest of the time that is before us if the law can be able to burden your heart to [Music] find a time to pray concentrate yourself that would be a good thing to do and brother branham says something i was reading this quote and it kind of uh uh it caught my mind something something came out of it that uh that i never saw before uh or that i was not looking in that direction he said he will not post it up he said ask the person sit down this is healing what sickness is the person who won't settle down we are in no hurry asked him he says that's what the matter with the word today we are too much of a rush he says businessmen take inventory of yourself before god sometimes when the meeting goes over an hour on an hour and 10 minutes oh mine what kind of a meeting remember he says remember how long you you are here and and then he goes on to say that if if we haven't got faith enough for healing of our bodies listen to this now if we haven't got faith enough for healing of our bodies how you going to go in the rapture [Music] he says because this mortar must take on immortality now so you see what we need is not healing [Music] what we need is faith for healing praise the lord amen i don't know what maybe maybe i'm the one but uh i mean when i read the code i just it just caught my attention you know most of the time we put the emphasis on healing praise the lord now what we need is faith because it would not be healing that would take us in the rapture it would be faith that would take us in the rapture amen so if if if if we have if if we are building our faith even if we don't have the the healing there were people that experienced healing that did not have faith there are people that experience divine healing that benefit from the faith of the congregation that benefit from the faith that is created in the meeting praise the lord so the emphasis is on faith and faith cometh by hearing so in one sense brother branham is saying here when it comes to the word that build our faith let us not be in a rush [Music] if you are reading the word whether at home or in church don't be in a raj because that's the thing it takes to build your faith praise the lord amen so the emphasis is on faith we need enough faith praise the lord and but but what i'm talking about tonight is to kind of encourage us to use this time and rest of the week to to take an inventory of ourself let's let's uh let's give ourselves you know give ourselves uh some time to fast this is not really going on on on a hunger strike amen what we want to do is that we want to we want to take an inventory we want to look at those areas in our life where we need god to help us we want to pay attention those things that are causing destruction and are taking much time much of our time we want to sit down a little bit [Music] we want to look at it we want to just we want to just look because the lord has been so good to us amen we would we will have that announced for you on sunday there are some few other things we will say towards that uh and and because of that that that the the the christmas week the christmas coming week [Music] we will not have service in that week i want to i want to really give time for us to be able to to just to just spend time you know brad braham says christmas worship you know uh and i just will have our christmas service on the weekend and uh i just think that you know we can be able to spend time with our loved ones at home and uh i mean if we uh even visiting the relatives i want to suggest just spend time just spend time with the lord i want us to be like the wise man you know coming from the east let's be wise this uh this christmas because the word is just is going into different order amen praise the lord and we know that you know for health reasons there are a lot of advices out there of that gathering in big groups that is not a reason why we are not having service on wednesday the major reason is because i want to encourage us to just have a time of concentration praise the lord because that will pretty much be our our our major busy week last busy week of the year the following week will just be the end of the year praise the lord amen i want us to work on our breaks to be able to slow down a little bit to be able to pause to be able to take an inventory the real inventory of our of our of our life and asking the lord to help us brother branham said party part of prisoner he says always don't judge your life how much power you have to perform miracle he said we don't judge ourself by how much knowledge you have of the world but always judge yourself look back take an inventory of what kind of a fruit that the life you presently live now is bearing praise the lord put on your breaks stop a little bit look in your review mirror look at the way we deal with things [Music] look at the way we responded to things praise

praise the lord amen let's take our bibles tonight i just want to be able to go over some few things here and as we we trust the lord to be able to help us praise the lord amen for the scripture reading let's just read psalm chapter eight we read that on sunday i just i just want to take uh uh one one part of that and uh so we trust the lord to be able to help us tonight i want to go over some of a few things that we dear with on sunday praise the lord amen psalm chapter 8 let's just read from verse 3 the psalmist said when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou have ordained what is men that thou are mindful of him and the son of man that thou visited him praise the lord amen let's pray together father we will ask your blessings tonight that you will come lord and bless your word as we fellowship around your word tonight father may you help us that we will say something of internal value something that would draw us closer something that will raise our faith up that we can be able to look to you you the altar and the finisher of our faith lord jesus bless us now lord in divine presence lord father even the sins that are streaming from whom and and different believers father god around the world we just pray that lord you would just give us a good time in in the service tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you can have your seat amen praise the lord amen are we together amen praise the lord amen praise the lord now so uh tonight i i just want to i want to step back a little bit in and uh and and be able to to uh just do a little review and go back to some of the few things that we were talking about now now uh uh brother harold baker over in south africa he have this this saying you know every time he talks about every time he speaks most every time you you hear him use this saying he says uh he says if there was no serpent see there will be no new birth he said the seventh sea makes a way for the new birth praise the lord amen because the reason why we had to be born again is because uh of the serpent seed amen so uh uh sunday we were we were trying to look at um you know uh few things in the scripture and uh we were looking at the the terrestrial body the celestial body and the glorified body praise the lord uh we were looking at uh the terrestrial body which is the ethnic body the celestial body which is the heavenly body and the glorified body praise the lord amen and uh so as as we look at that we started talking from genesis chapter one we look at genesis chapter one god made man in his image which was a spirit man and we said that there was the celestial body amen and then god came down and made man out of the dust of the earth that was the terrestrial body are we together now uh uh on the brother brandon ministry he he he helped us to be able to see uh in the scripture i'm i'm i'm kind of trying not to go in to take you through a kind of a long route here for the wednesday night because uh uh they are just a lot of things on my mind but we we we saw like like when we talk about abraham uh the father of faith god established with abraham and the way that he dealt with abraham brother branham says that's the way he's going to deal with abraham's seed amen and in his visitation to abraham we we we can see through the scripture from genesis chapter 12 and over to genesis chapter 18 there were seven visitations seven visitation seven seven different times that god visited abraham and in those seven visitation there were two visitation where god took a form praise the lord amen now you're you know you you just follow me in a little bit here and and and just like we said uh uh you know uh we read the scripture we talked about where paul went to the tear heavens and we seized the other john uh uh you know the apostle john that wrote the book of uh revelation the book of saint john first john ii john t john brother branham said he was also caught up just like paul was caught up amen so there were three men you know in the history of the scripture that were caught up into the heavens that's paul that's john and there's brother branham praise the lord amen and and uh uh we also talked about uh uh the first resurrection and second resurrection we will come to death but what i want what i wanted to show to us today is that uh to see how god put in man he he locked in man a mystery of himself praise the lord amen he locked in man a mystery of himself he gave man soul body and spirit praise the lord they soul body and spirit that we have uh i mean in this body this is my body you know i have a spirit i have a soul that is inside that is the nature of my spirit now so and and and that is the same way god in his manifestation manifested himself as father son and the holy ghost praise the lord amen now we have to realize that this god that we worship is not a one that we have made amen we have not made god with our understanding of the bible he has made us and until we leave from here to go to be with him there is more of him that we will learn every day praise the lord there is more of him that he will keep revealing to us and keep on falling to us praise the lord now so we see here that god like i said on sunday when he made that declaration let us make man in our image he started out of our trouble praise the lord but yet there was something that he was going to unfold it's it's beautiful if the law would just be able to help us be young myself and uh there were there were things that he was going to bring out to help he made man in his image a spirit man and then genesis chapter two he came down and made man out of the dust of the earth praise the lord and and uh so we see that there there's there's two form and the reason why is because god would deal with us in that way praise the lord he would deal with us in that way now after the flood and god will establish a covenant with our father abraham he gave abraham a word come out of your father house and make you the father of nation go to a land whose mirror and builder is god we know that was the inspiration of abraham's heart praise the lord he heard the voice of god just like faith cometh by hearing amen and and abraham pick up and he started to travel but yet in this walk god will deal with him in different manifestation praise the lord he would deal with him in different manifestation visions god would deal with him with visions god would speak to him he would hear the voice of god he would capture it by faith just like god speaks to you it's not audible but you can capture it by faith you're having a little attention when you tone yourself up in prayer and you tune yourself up in the word of god when god speaks you can be able to capture that little voice of god praise the lord amen so he he he would deal with our father abraham that way he would deal with him by visions and different manifestations he would give to abraham but there was another manifestation two major manifestation one was in genesis chapter 15. let's read there genesis chapter 15. praise the lord genesis chapter 15 genesis chapter 15 verse 18. genesis chapter 15 verse 18. praise the lord are we together now we see here that god has just called abraham out he have just called abraham out and he have just he have just took abraham to the place no i'm giving you the wrong scripture it is now 15 is 14 is genesis chapter 14. genesis chapter 14 verse 18. now so we see here uh this was after abraham went to to uh to rescue lot and and the king of sodom praise the lord which of course brother branham over and over he he lacking there to go in after a falling brother amen the part of god like the bible says there is only one mediator between man and god amen the man christ jesus and the scripture says that uh uh you know is is god reconciling us back to jesus christ amen so that ministry of reconciliation is not the one of going out to pass tracks amen no it's not the one to invite people to our church but the one that goes out for the sole purpose of the saving of a soul it has to be god but ram says when man fell in the beginning god never sent an angel amen he came down himself praise the lord he was the one saying adam adam where are you the ability to reconcile men back to god is not the ability of a man it has to be god are we together now so brother branham lacking this efficient parallel joshua over and over you will see how he lacking this this experience abraham going after lot you have to realize lord has already gone to sodom he has settled down in sodom i mean he's living there happily now sodom has been captured abraham heard about it and he's going there he i'm the man of his house to go and and bring ba and bring lot back not only a lot but just to be able to save the people out of the hands of the the their captives amen now so we see here after abraham did that in the way that it moves god the bible says he came down amen verse 18 14 18 the the the the the the scripture will now speak of mecidic the king of salon brought for bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and he blessed and and and blessed be the most high god which have uh delivered an enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithe of all abraham was the one giving him in tired of all amen and the kingdom of sodom said unto abraham give me the person and take the ghost okay then we we know the rest of the story but after abraham has gone out and rescued now god explained the plan of redemption in a shadow praise the lord in the message communion brother branham says this was the battle of life god is playing the plan of redemption in a shadow now so after abraham went out and and he redeemed a lord and and the king of sodom and the people of sodom from the hands of those that captured them god came in a form he came in a form now follow me now but in this form god self abraham what we have in a type as the communion god says abraham bread and wine but what is amazing in this form there is no scriptural evidence that he took of it that's what i wanted i want to catch your mind he offered abraham bread and wine amen and the bible says abraham in return gave him the tenth of all abraham paid tithes which of course an order was established there are we together now when i'm trying to balance us tonight or trying to help us to see that when jesus resurrected there was one form where he told mary don't touch me amen i have not ascended to the father yet but then just in the evening time when he came into the amaze he was able to have them to touch him praise the lord he was able to eat bread and fish but yet he could disappear from the amaze are we together now so we see here yeah god came as the priest he came as the priest the chief shepherd the pastor of all and he gave abraham a communion service then we will also see in genesis chapter 18 there was another form that god came in praise the lord amen abraham saw three men coming praise the lord which of course brother branham says and god took the dust and blew and said you get inside one angel and say you get inside and he blew a body and god himself got in that body praise the lord amen are we together what i'm trying to bring i'm trying to bring what happened in genesis one and two went through the scripture it was the different ways and form you remember when the angel met manoa's wife praise the lord the anger she says uh uh uh uh you know uh uh go and call your husband the husband came and they were all there he says who are you he says my name is secret it says uh uh uh you know can we fetch bread and wine for you and and this that and and and they try to face you know food for the angel and they realize he consume it in a fire and he disappears oh our eyes have seen god they were formed that he talked that he could sit down and partake of bread they were formed that he talked he would visit men he would bless them and he would just go away are we together praise the lord amen so yet in genesis chapter 18 we see almighty god elohim took a form and he and he came down and abraham recognized him and said my lord said amen and he sent word to sarah face food and milk to feed them to eat praise the lord amen and and it was it was in that it was it was at a place where her back was turned to the tent and he descended the need of sarah praise the lord amen now because of this experience and in fulfillment to sin luke 17 30 when jesus said as it was in the days of sodom amen so shall it be in the son of man praise the lord jesus prophesied that that will repeat in our day praise the lord and uh and and and we and we witness it in brother bran and ministering as we listen to the tape you know uh the sign of the masai there's a clear one where he says now i turn my back to the to the congregation you know he says that but what has happened here is that and what i want to show you because of the experience of uh genesis 18 and what the lord did in brother branham ministry it brought out a teaching called elohim people falsely taught that brother branham was elohim what what spo what destroyed that teaching is because brother branham was born of a father and a mother the natural birth destroyed that teaching because of the natural birth no man can be elohim no flesh elohim can take flesh but no flesh can be elohim [Applause] are we together praise the lord amen because we are going from the terrestrial to the celestial and back to the glorified the glorified body is when their celestra takes on the terrestrial that's what makes a glorifier when they are separate they are terrestrial and celestro when they are separate their terrestrial body can eat they can sleep amen praise the lord but the celestial body don't eat like the terrestrial body but when the celestial body takes on terrestrial and becomes glorified then it eats are we together we talk about tiofani tiofani is celestra body praise the lord amen glory be to god so god show himself to our father abraham he took a form praise the lord now because when i'm bringing you two when we read the book of corinthian when paul was talking first corinthians chapter 15 paul was talking about the different ones that have seen him amen he said seafarers have seen him there were 500 i also saw him in there he says but i also saw him and the form that paul saw him in was not a terrestrial body paul saw him in a different form praise the lord amen and in that form that paul saw him is the form that he's been dealing with us in praise the lord amen glory to god are we together amen praise the lord you love the lord tonight praise the lord jesus amen amen amen question and answer number two uh praise the lord and uh jordan if you're able to refer to that for us that is part of what we use on uh sunday well let's just let's take uh number one let's take number one there's a question and answer number one and there's a question and answer number two those whom he called he justified those whom he justified he glorified praise the lord amen now and and the reason why i was i would get to the reason why uh you know i had to i want to explain that you know uh because uh there's there are some teachings that are not right you know and and sometimes it confuses people because when when the when the psalmist said who is man that they were mindful of him and that thou visited him if you look at that word visit is god moving in and out of our dimension is god dealing with his children he visit us in different ways praise the lord he visits some true dreams he visits some true inspiration praise the lord amen we will get to that but he says those whom he called he justified those whom he justified he glorified and every redeemed person in the word this morning that's under the blood of jesus christ filled with the holy ghost have everlasting life and can perish and is already in heavenly places with christ jesus every redeemed person under the blood filled with the holy ghost has everlasting life and can perish and is already amen jesus in in john chapter 6 he says the son which is already with the father in heaven why he was on earth he was telling the pharisees he said the son or that is already with the father but he was yet on earth it's already in heavenly places in christ jesus and shall never come to condem condemnation already redeemed isn't that wonderful seed already redeemed sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus already glorified already glorified just think your glorified body is right here at the tabernacle now the presence of the holy spirit which is your glorified condition amen the presence of the holy spirit which is your glorified condition that's the reason why when it bumps into this flesh you shall aiming sometimes you shy you surprise yourself i never even knew i was going to shout amen when it bounced into your body yeah you streamed that and you're in the spirit if we read it oh my goodness amen you're glorious you are glorified in christ right now those who are justified he glorified and your own glorified body is standing near you right now in christ jesus to give to you a strength like a church going into a body praise the lord that's why we have to be in the spirit praise the lord we have to worship in the spirit we have to pray in the spirit we have to sing in the spirit are we together praise the lord because of the sin nature that boy they cannot overtake this body they can't dwell together sin is the breach they can't dwarf together because incorruption cannot inhabit corruption praise the lord so what it does is that it charge us praise the lord amen it sends some strength down and say hold on my child joy cometh in the morning praise the lord all the devil can can blast your head knock it against the wording and put all the wrong you have done and everything before you and then uh just a reading of a psalm or just a word of the lord will just come and sweep and you just guest strained glory to god thank you jesus praise the lord amen but bram says it gives you strength like a charge going into a battery the holy ghost is in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world praise the lord you see that's that's the reason why i want us to to to concentrate ourselves because we are moving slowly to that place where we could be overtaken by that spirit that's the rapture sweep away amen praise the lord glory be to god amen you love the lord tonight amen does that encourage you praise the lord he's standing right here right by your side to give you some charge [Applause] we might feel discouraged you know when different things happening but uh it does not take god by surprise amen he knows where you are he knows exactly where you are he knows the measure of your faith the measure of your strength and he just stepped in there and just gave you a hit on the shoulder amen praise the lord it is one of those things word i mean he just sweep sweep by when you when you start crying and you don't know what you're crying about amen it's a presence that your body your physical body is not useful praise the lord when our presence pass it over take this body it makes this body nervous now brother brahms who says in the prayer line you are nervous because he's here don't be nervous he's not going to hurt you praise the lord are we together amen it's it's it's just like when when uh when when your physical body is overtaken by a negative atmosphere you feel afraid you feel afraid you can be in the midst of thousands of people you are afraid thoughts just start coming to your mind somebody wants to shoot me somebody want to destroy me you are just afraid because you are overtaken by a negative spirit are we together praise the lord it's here to give you charge and that's what we need in this hour that we are living in we need to feed his presence amen we need to feed his presence because there is there is just a squeeze of darkness that is coming in amen it's just it's just it's just pressurizing the mind and all that we might be left to if god don't help us it's just a church identification and no spiritual life to show for it no desire for the word no spending time in his presence so we need a charge we need a visitation of the lord what is man that thou visited him lord visit me praise the lord are we together we need a visitation in our assembly we need a visitation in our homes we need a visitation in our own personal devotion where the pages of this word is speaking back to me are we together amen now he says the holy ghost is in you is to charge your body to give you new strength to heal you from your sickness that you have got and to make you well amen is to give you new strength is to heal you to give you strength and you know have good keep you in good health keep your mind straight praise the lord keep our desire on the lord that's what he's giving for are we together now he says this also in uh question answer number two he says we did live in the blessed ring by the altar of god he said don't you know john saw the souls under the altar crying how long lord how long to to come back to earth to be clothed upon amen there ain't a celestial body praise the lord they are in a celestial body i'm going to read something to you here and uh i'm trying to get it here they are in a celestial body uh let's take uh brother uh jordan if you can help me did uh the arrow the arrow of god's deliverance shot from the board for some reason some of these quotes i have i have the names at the bottom of them some of them have them at the top i don't know what i was doing i was just enjoying myself but let's let's take this one he said you see you will never be an angel you know that you will never be an angel you will never get old you will never be wrinkled you will never be sick he's talking about on that other side you will never have worry you will never be an injured you will be a human being only immortal you will have a glorified body like his body you will both eat and drink and live and love and associate forever and ever amen now so the souls under the altar brother branham said uh we're almost on time here so i will pick that up uh another time here to show to you he says the souls under the altar the crying how long he says they wanted to come back and be clothed upon in another quote he says they wanted to come and eat praise the lord amen they wanted to come and eat and drink why because in a celestial body you don't eat and drink and because they were not made to be like that it was not their ori it was only a temporary state it was not their original state so they wanted to come back to the original state that's the reason why last wednesday i said when he said how long in the sense of vengeance it was to show that they were jews amen they were not the gentile bride because the gentile brother will not call for vengeance amen but in their state where they were dwelling because that was not the state they were ordained to be in they wanted to come back and put on the flesh where they can eat and drink are we together amen he make man in his image male and female in the image of god created hidden because they were ordained for the earth he put them in a body praise the lord in a body and in that body man was dominating man was ruling the earth adam was naming the animals he was speaking to the mountains and everything praise the lord are we together amen that's the reason why when the the scripture says when when uh when when adam and eve when when when they broke the veil they knew something left him more than just being naked physically they knew that something left him but branham says he think his man felt her he said that holyfield left him amen praise the lord are we together when the scripture speaks about you know uh i mean we would not uh uh uh we would not be hungry really does not means that we will not eat it it means that just like we will not feed pain there would not be a feeling of hunger we would not feed it like man i'm really hungry i need to get something to eat man i'm hungry i mean hunger will be turning your eyes you won't feed it but it does not mean that we will not eat praise the lord it does not means that we will not drink now you see that is the reason why when brother branham taught fasting and praying he taught it a different way he said the human body was made for food and water don't deny yourself food and water when your body is desiring it that's the way he said when your body is desiring it go and eat praise the lord because a feast a a fast in the flesh is a feast with the lord praise the lord if you are not praying and you're not reading the word you're just starving yourself you're not fasting and for you to pray you need your body needs water you need energy unless god call you to eat don't do it that's what brother branham said that has made people to give themselves to familiar spirits they have turned their body over to demonic attack god called moses to 40 days and fought at night god called him and clothed him with the shackana glory if god don't call you don't starve your body [Music] and be spitting all over the place that's not fast if you are fasting you must be spending time in god's word you must be praying you must have the energy to do it you don't have the energy you get laying down there when will the time reach six twelve o'clock then you're spending time on facebook and you're all over the place that's not fast that's not fast you are abusing your body because the thing that keeps the body together is full in water praise the lord you want to deny yourself from food and water do it in the space of time where you know you can pray and concentrate on the lord because the devil when jesus fasted the devil tempted him then what about you and myself the devil tempted him and if you are not spending that time with the lord it's a feast with the lord you must enjoy it if you are not enjoying it god is not enjoying it just forget about it if you are not enjoying it god is not enjoying it just get away from it because our god don't believe in abuse god don't abuse his children are we together are you understanding me because that's what sustained this terrestrial body that's what sustained this terrestrial body it's food and water all i mean all of those those uh uh you know uh uh uh uh you know uh religious idea where people says well i mean you you have to you have to punish your body you you have to subject your body if you can do it and concentrate if you can do it and keep your mind on god god bless you if you can't keep your mind on god praise the lord please go find something to eat are we together please go find something to eat are we together praise the lord don't worry um there's there are a lot of things that we'll bring in this in this because there's another part of it where brother branham also talks about the ted element that benefit this body full water and sleep we will deal with that amen sleep is a gift that god give us he gave sleep to his beloved it's a gift are we together but uh we after nine o'clock here tonight so uh we would just we'll stop here and uh you know and then be able to find a place here to pray them and then we can go home so trying to show that god when he make man in his image that's the thought you should you should be able to keep in your mind when he make man in his image brother branham said that over and over he make man a spirit man because god is a spirit but man was not ordained to be spirit praise the lord he was not ordained to be spirit that is the reason why we struggle just to be spiritual i just want to be spiritual lord i just want to be spiritual i want to be in the spirit you in the flesh subject yourself to the spirit amen praise the lord subject this body to the holy spirit that's what we are called to do it's not to rule out if you have a feeling deal with it amen what a good feeling or a wrong feeling dean with it and bring a subject to the word of god he made us to inhabit the earth that's the reason why after we go one thousand years we will come back on earth after the one thousand years eternity we coming back on earth because we are ordained for this earth we are ordained for this elf you will not be an angel when the pharisees came to jesus the sadducees trying to destroy his teaching on resurrection and said that you know that woman she has seven husbands who will be jesus says you will be just like the angels the reason why he said that is to erase the fact that when we leave this body the sexual emotion is taken away that's what he was dealing with because that was the question they brought to him it does not mean that you would be injured no but you would be like angels without no sexual emotion and affection because sex came by the serpent and when we leave this body it stays right here it came from the dust it would go back to the dust praise the lord you see while the enemy tried to make this age pollute the minds and and support the minds of the people and and i mean it should not be because of sexual desire you should want to get married praise the lord are we together young people are we together we are made to inhabit the earth and because this body is part of the earth you must subject it to the word of god that is the way to be in the spirit is to bring your thoughts your feeling everything subject to the word of god are we together praise the lord if i create question on your mind just write it down we will address it the lord bless you tonight musicians you can come because when you give yourself to a little consecration the devil knows that so he will try to to blast your mind he tried to bring you know he makes the the the smell of food sweet he just put your mind on all sorts of kind of things just to be able to rob you and then right there now you says oh god you know then then you start feeling condemned because you are thinking about food and say lord i'm not supposed to be thinking about food and no it's because you are abusing your body we all does not have the same limits there are people that can concentrate themselves and go three days we don't have the same measure of faith praise the lord we don't have the same measure of faith and god want to deal with you according to your measure of faith [Music] praise the lord it's a wrong teaching so says our fasting is from sister says you don't you didn't you break the fat before sisters say you are kana it's a wrong teaching all of those things expose young people young christians to spiritual challenges and ministers think they are making their church spiritual [Music] the messenger never taught it that way [Music] even brother branham he says the monster have fasted three days but yet he had a way to spend more time with god he had a way to spend more time with god trying to help us to appreciate what god has given to us appreciate what god is doing in your life appreciate your measure of faith don't compare yourself to anybody [Music] if you pray one hour you don't have to brag about it like i pray one hour i was in the spirit i prayed two hours [Music] you could spend five hours and don't say nothing to god [Music] you can spend five hours just before your idol and no connection with god [Music] god is real he's real [Music] when you talk give him time to talk that real conversation when you finish talking give god time to talk sit back and that's the one that is difficult for us we just want to tell him lord jesus lord i want you to do this lord okay amen give him time to talk that's not conversation you just you are the commander are we together praise the lord we appreciate the lord tonight let's give the lord a hand of praise [Music] let's just sing that song tonight in the city where the lime is the light before we pray i am [Music] is [Music] in the city where the land is [Music] is [Music] [Music] where the line is that's the reason why the emphasis is giving christ the preeminence the emphasis is subjecting ourself to god praise the lord that is the proof of your new birth that you can humble yourself to the word that you can submit yourself to the world because that's all god is doing he's going to use this body in the millennium he's going to use this body in eternity that's the reason why he want to subject this body to the world [Music] even though it's not going to be as as as elderly as it is amen is going to be in his tenderness praise the lord is going to be in his tenderness it's going to be in its best form and best shape that's why the emphasis is to submit ourselves to the world can we just pray tonight the more i surrender let's just sing the accuracy the more i surrender the light of my lord and let just pray and say lord i surrender help me to submit myself to your word [Music] the more i surrender the light of my lord i release my gifts the more you take control the more i can humble myself the more you lift me up every day [Music] the light of my lord
