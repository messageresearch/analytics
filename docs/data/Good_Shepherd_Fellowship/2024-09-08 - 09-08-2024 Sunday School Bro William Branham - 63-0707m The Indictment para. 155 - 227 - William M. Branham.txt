TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] what are you saying that preacher how are you building your platform here that they crucifying that they are crucifying the effects of the Gospel upon the people by their Creeds amen yes that's a crucifixion that where the public set these big margs called churches denominations and draw line of creed and that had the word of God can't have an effect upon it because they they condemned the very things that Christ said would take place it just don't come according to their Creed and neither did Jesus come according to their understanding of him coming he coming the way that God sent him and he come exactly with the word no wonder he said he hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it the baby such as would learn Hallelujah do you understand oh they have crucify the effects of the word I got a bunch of scriptures here I might just quote to a three of them they crucified you say how do they crucify the word when Jesus said that he's the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 they say in such a way he is all right and the Jesus said his last commandment to the church go ye into all the World Mark 16 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe all the world to Every Creature it ain't half reached yet and his millions die every year that don't ever even heard the name of Jesus so it's still the general orders it's still the Commandment of God all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it shall not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and they say that was for that generation and they make the Commandment of God of not effect to this and they crucify the effect of the word to the people amen Peter said on the day of Pentecost with the keys to the kingdom that Jesus had just given him whatever you say here I'll say it up there and on the day of Pentecost they asked what they might do to receive the Holy Spirit if they was so enjoying it watching others acting uh what they would call uh silly stagger and jumping falling and acting like they were drunk and they say these men are full of new wine but there was a man stood up by the name of Peter who had the keys to the kingdom and said these are not drunken acts two as you suppos since the third eye of the day but this is that which is spoken of see right back to the word again showing that the spirit is still word the word is still Spirit yes the word of God and it shall come spoken by the prophet Joel Joel 238 and it shall come to pass in the last days sayith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh listen to that Prophet stand there look at him Fearless standing there upon that bunch and condemning them inditing them said this is the scripture this is that that was spoke of by the prophet I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy all my handmaids and Maid servant I pour out of my spirit I'll show signs in the heavens above and on Earth fire and pillars of smoke and Vapor proven it by the word that it was the word and they laughed and made fun of it and they went to judgment and the city was burnt and they eat one another's children and today there are scattered people throughout all the world showing the Holy Spirit Still Remains the word of God God to bring this word to make it live Jesus Christ was the person man God hallelujah amen he was the manifestation of God he was God in a body form to reflect the word of God for that age to make that age see God's promise for that age and the Holy Ghost is the same thing today it's the spirit of God upon the written word trying to find somebody to reflect itself to this age yes to prove that he's the same yesterday ver St John 14:12 The Works that I do shall you also Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever see constantly trying to find its way to reflect itself and they could not do it the people thought so much of their denominations their little Nest that they had and so forth call their churches so they wouldn't listen to it so do they do it today same thing crucify aresh Peter on the day of Pentecost he said you man that dwell in Jerusalem in Judea hearken to my words these are not drunk if you'll stand still I'll show you what it is and he goes ahead and explains to them one of their hearts is pricked when they heard this so what can we do to be saved what can we do to receive this we're convinced that your word is right he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this to you and your children they as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call this is what they got to do repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and today the Roman Catholic Church adopted father son Holy Ghost to take that place instead of that a communion Li out a tongue and take up wafer and the priest drink the wine and you're one together the communion in the stead of being the Holy Ghost called Holy Eucharist and a father son Holy Ghost a trinitarian baptism was not even spoke of in the Bible amen amen the name of father son Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ and when you show that to this honor generation as Peter said save yourself from this honor generation when you show it to them what do they do make fun of it and say our church don't teach it that way then you're guilty you're guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ by taking the power of God away from the people you crucify the very word to them and you condemn yourself with your congregation lead him into a death trap as I said about that Minister last Sunday there Martin Luther King down there with them precious people leading right into a death trap oh somebody could only talk to that man wish I could just for an little uprising of a school proposition see what difference my goodness if the people ain't got hard enough to associate with a man because of his color they're condemned and dead anyhow Amen brother the nation gives right don't fight against it don't what if somebody said all the Irish or somebody all the German or somebody else had to dissociate that would never bother Christians that move right on and that man's a Christian is is a minister he shouldn't lead them people into a revolt against that they're going to cause Millions to die it'll start another revolutionary and it's a shame to do that the same thing happens right here exactly the same thing again that's right see the people how that they'd only look at truth and see what truth is our church don't believe that we got some other way well it ain't the right way it ain't the thing he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins now they won't do it oh then what do they do now that's just one thing upon hundreds we'll get to maybe as fast as we can now the second crucifixion then if a man accepts Father Son and Holy Spirit a a Creed instead of the word titles instead of the the name what does he do to the people he crucifies the effects of the word to the people when he says that Mark 16 was just for that generation and God said himself right there Jesus talking to him said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these sign shall follow them how for every nation every Creed every tongue every race every people the same gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe and when a man tries to cut that out of the Bible he crucifies the effects of the Gospel to that congregation amen hallelujah so I indict you in the name of Jesus Christ you're guilty of murdering the Lord hallelujah the church hated him why he was their very God they hated him and denied him to be their Messiah no sir they didn't want such a messiah as that and today the church does the same thing it denies a word they don't want it it's contradictory to what they've been taught to believe by their Creeds amen and the word is a messiah you believe that well the reflection of the word then is what amen a reflecting the Messiah which is the Holy Ghost Among Us he's reflecting himself try to worry if he can find a lamp that he can look through it Ain smoked up with Creeds and things he can give light through remember they Rose and trim their lamps and washed out the chimneys but it's too late so when a man sees these Lutheran Presbyterian methodists trying to come in these last days to receive the Holy Ghost why you know they don't get it that's right oh they might speak in tongues and jump up and down but Watch What Happens they absolutely it's a Time sign that she's over we're at the end most any time the the church could hear the challenge to come on high amen amen just exactly setting us in order the Holy Spirit here making Jesus Christ a reality through the ones that he can work through proving himself come down takes his picture shows it makes Science Tech talk about it everything else proving just exactly what he said he would do doing it exactly the things he said he would do scripturally not not some Creed or some man's worked up idea a lot of blood fire and smoke and stuff but a scriptural Messiah evidence got a lot of impersonations and impersonators and and so forth but that only makes a real word shine its best right that's people who are spiritual who can judge between right and wrong Lord see denies him denied their Messiah we didn't want him the same thing they do today well if I had to go down there and act like that bunch I don't want it at all all right then you don't have it at all that's all same now although he was properly identified they didn't want him they hated him why was it we call their pastors a bunch of snakes he said you bunch of whiteed walls you're nothing but a graveyard the outside of his is polished with robes and turned around collars and the inside's dead man's boom he didn't pull no punches one little bitty galileon a carpenter son but he didn't pull no punches he told him don't think John said the Forerunner of said he's another didn't pull any punches he said don't come around here saying now you got Abraham to our father God's able to these stones to rise children Abraham yes sir the ax is laid to the root of the tree and every tree that don't bring forth fruits HED down and cast Into the Fire yes sir God is strict and firm and Stern with his word yes sir notice Jesus proved by the scripture do you hear me am Jesus was identified by God through the scriptures that he was Messiah is that right amen we get to Peter's indictment a few minutes you'll find out where it was not he was thoroughly identified that he was God manifested in a man called the son of God that's right although he was properly identified and Vindicated the promised word that he was Messiah Moses said this Messiah when he comes he'll be a prophet and all these things will take place the little woman with the stand at the well and all that dirty condition that she was what that symbolize that God in these last days would pull out Outcast remember last night at the wedding or the other time I preached here at the wedding supper he s how they said I've made a great feast and so forth and all these men I bit them and each one had an excuse I can't do it because it would ruin our Creeds I can't come because I have a uh uh my married a wife she won't let me come my I I got married to a church down here my mother was Methodist or Baptist or Catholic or I just can't stand for that he said and you won't come and you won't taste my supper but get out there and compel prostitutes and harlots and drunkards and whatever there is bring them in I'll straighten them up hallah I made my supper and my guest my table setting it's going to be somebody [Applause] there they didn't come it's condemning them Jews what about today Hallelujah I I belong to the Presbyterian I can't Lutheran I'm a Oneness I'm a Tess I'm a this I can't I can't there you are you won't be there then amen that's exactly what he said said all right properly a Vindicated Messiah properly a Vindicated the word the promised word the god that promised the word that this what the Messiah would be here he come and stood exactly and he said to him now where have I failed if you can't believe me as a man believe the works that I do for they are the things that tell who I am amen they're the ones that says I'm Messiah you don't want to believe me because you think of Joseph over there and I was born over there and that little Hut and and my uh Foster father here is a a carpenter down there and and you when to come into Galilee there they and was going to make he said here who is this fell who is this well this man isn't that isn't Jo and all them his brothers here isn't his sisters with isn't his mother called Mary and his daddy called Joseph where you get a guy like that what school did he come from he has no Fellowship ship card he don't have any credentials where did a guy like it where'd you get this it anyhow and the Bible said he was a is offended he said many mighty Works he could not do and just turned his back and walked away from him said a prophet's not without honor except among his own people in his own County watch or in his own country there he is properly Vindicated the Messiah took no credit of his own he said I can do nothing but what I see the father doing and he challenge them to ask that that was the Messiah and look at that little old ill Fame woman she recognized it she she wasn't doated the lamp on she was morally wrong of course no one would endorse that the laws of God condemn that she was morally wrong but you see God don't judge you uh upon your what you are he enjoy he judges not how big you are how little you are he judges your heart what you want to be and she didn't want none that stuff when just flash before that's that's what she wanted Hallelujah no matter what she was then she's ready to come amen God judges the heart man judges the outward appearance God looks upon the heart no matter what she was that light flash that settled it she caught the the the the essence of eternal life oh my how rich this is to me to see I know that it's the truth I'll I'll stand by this I let the god of heaven will raise up in my voice will be on the Magnetic Tape of God's great time Y and it'll condemn this generation in the last day because it's on magnetic tape then to be on the Eternal tape then try condemn this generation of preachers who has a form of godliness and denying the power of the word and manifestation when it's properly identified that he still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I indict them by the word of God I have to get to another promise quickly cuz you only got about 15 minutes there they there they what oh Calvary They Crucified thirdly They Crucified him not by recognizing God's promised word made manifest and why did they crucify that man could you just imagine let me go back a minute why would them people crucify a man like that as Mary as I read a book one time called a prince the House of David is wrote by Ingram Dr Ingram wonderful booket of drama supposed to be partly true of some old manuscript was taken off of a woman named Medina and her she went over to Palestine from from down in Egypt to Cairo I believe it was to finish her education she was there during a time of of Christ and she's sped right back to her father it'd be good if you picked it up read it it's really good uh Prince the House of David the same man wrote Pillar of Fire and out of that a cecal de Mill stuck The Ten Commandments now we find it in this book this Adena wrote back and she said on the day of the crucifixion that Mary magalina Bon Hood he cast out Seven Devils run out before the crowd and said what has he done what has he done only heal the sick and try to deliver those that were in prisons what has he done but good some somebody said and a man slapped her Plum across a yard almost and said would you bleed that silly woman before your priest there you are see what had he done done nothing why they crucifying why why because they didn't recognize who he was that's the same thing today the preachers and people of this days and our modern teachers has so or the devil or a mental telepathy or some hoax or some kind of a trick until the people don't recognize that it's a Vindication of God's word for this day it's the last day signs the churches if you don't belong to their organization they'll say oh well that's some makeup that's that's hoax we look down here so and so and so and so but let them one time prove the real thing to be a hoax let them one time prove that it's wrong they can't do it right it's never been known to be wrong and it never will be because it's God but they like the point they think oh well if it was some a man with a great name because it's a little group a little Bunch it's kind of outcast well we turn that person out of our church he they they used to come to our group see but they went over with this and they went over that and now they see they wind up well look what it is who it is I don't care they could said the same thing about Peter James and John or ignorant and unlearned man they said but they had to take notice something that happen happen since that time they had been with Jesus that's what made the difference they did it because they didn't know who he was they didn't know that the Vindication of God's word wasn't standing up there in that day now it wasn't one day that was right it wasn't one day just keep them laws and things but the same laws that was they was to keeping pointed them to a time that when he would come and be this man that he was supposed to be they had this part but didn't take the other part and that's the same thing they're doing now they got a church and they believe in Jesus Christ and say they're doing things but deny the hour we're living in still brings the old proverb back again man always praising God for what he has done looking forward for what he would do and or will do and ignoring what he's doing and being condemned by yes amen they think God's wonderful how great he is what he's going to do he's going to come and be a Rapture someday go home and denying the very signs and wonders right here at the time that the scripture says that he'll be doing it Miss the whole thing if the blind lead the blind Jesus said they'll all fall in a ditch just pray God to open our eyes in this last days all right now the same they do the same today they deny and crucify the same God today but not knowing him the same by denying him and doing by denying the things that they're doing today they don't crucify Christ again exactly but they blaspheme the Holy Ghost and by doing it they are how do they blaspheme the Holy Ghost how how did they blaspheme it that back there why they couldn't blaspheme it then hadn't come yet they called Jesus be elub called him be elub because he could know the secrets of their hearts and things he said this is a devil in other words he's a fortune teller that's how he does this it's by fortune telling he's nothing but a devil see they had had a prophet in 400 years and they done grow it out of it see they just had their laws they said this is a be above and Jesus said I'll forgive you for that but when the Holy Ghost has come now you speak a word against it and it'll never be forgiven you remember it will and cannot by no means no mercy when you blaspheme and call the spirit of God the word of God that's being Vindicated by the spirit see the word says so the spirit's are vindicating it and you call it an unclean thing you've crossed the line between mercy and judgment and can never be forgiven for it that's the reason I D this generation of guilty of crucifying blaspheming the manifested Son of God amen hallelujah amen as is Promised for all the prophets and Christ himself to be in the last days like it was in the days of Noah and the days of Sodom blasphemy which they crucify to the people the Son of God of Flesh he is a Vindicated word one word against it can never be forgiven now what are you going to do then why are you going to stand there condemned just waiting the hour of God's Wrath to be pour out you'll Crum on loving doctrine of man-made denominations and dogmas better than they do their Vindicated word of God this generation of people oh I I just wish I had a long time for this this generation of people this generation sperms God's revelation amen but we're walking where the apostles have tried God you say well others say that too God vindicates it am Jesus said if if if the works don't speak of me then just go ahead and say I'm saying it myself but the works speak you better believe the works because it's the hour said you know tomorrow the sun's going to shine or it's going to be foul weather but the skies red and L tomorrow be fair said you can discern the face of the Skies but the signs of the time you know nothing about if you would have known God You' have known my day and they said you take so much upon yourself you make yourself God and put him on the cross and the Holy Ghost today is not no third person it's God himself manifested in human flesh by the blood of Jesus Christ to sanctify a life that he might reflect himself through and they crucify that same word made manifest you understand amen the crucifixion of Christ today is the people who will deny the Vindicated and manifested Son of God Among The People by his things that he said would take place in this day by his word now the same Vindication would have to be the same if he's the same Son of God because he said in St John 14:12 now that The Works that I do shall you do also Hebrews 13:8 is same yesterday and forever if ye abide me John 15 if you abide me and my words abide in you just ask what you will it'll be given to you yes sir [Music]
