[19:28] So we believe God can do the same. Amen.
[19:31] He's able to do the same for our sister.

[19:38] brother Lawrence tonight just like we
[19:40] said that the Lord will just bring him
[19:42] uh the surgery went well and uh uh so we
[19:46] want to pray that the Lord will bring
[19:48] him through. We want to remember brother
[19:50] Wesley talking to brother Wesley that

[19:55] uh he asked that we pray for him uh uh
[19:59] uh after his eye surgery his eyes has

[20:08] eyes. So he want us to remember him in
[20:10] prayer. Sister Alice left this evening
[20:13] to join brother Ben for his mother's

[21:22] saying she may pass today so uh maybe
[21:26] that might have happened if the Lord
[21:29] keep us here kept kept her here then
[21:32] that's uh for his
[21:33] glory and uh we also I want to remember
[21:37] a brother, brother
[21:41] Matthew Lusaka. He's uh uh there's a
[21:46] small group down in

[56:06] Lord. I don't know about you, but I just
[56:09] love his presence. Amen. Amen. I just
[56:12] love his presence.
[56:14] Praise the Lord. You know, most of the
[56:16] time we we talk about
[56:18] worship. We we think about how we feel,
[56:22] you know, whether we enjoy the song or
[56:25] whether we, you know, we enjoy our move
[56:28] and all of that. But, you know, it's
[56:30] it's uh it's a different thing when you
[56:33] make him to feel worship. Amen. Make God
[56:36] to feel worship. Make him to feel
[56:38] worship.
[56:40] It's just uh it's like you just you're
[56:42] just rubbing all yourself on him. It
[56:44] says uh just take me just as I am.
[56:47] Praise the Lord.
[56:49] Amen. Just take him. The word I love you
[56:53] has been so abused by the
[56:56] society. It's used for all sorts of
[56:59] filthy and dirtiness that even for
[57:01] people to tell God I love you. You know
[57:04] the Bible says uh the spirit of the age
[57:07] will not be thankful. We have to be
[57:09] thankful. Praise the Lord. If you don't
[57:12] have nothing to say, don't be blank when
[57:14] you are praying. The devil will abuse
[57:16] your mind. Just keep telling God how
[57:18] much you love him. I love you. I
[57:20] appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you for
[57:22] the breath that I breathe. Thank you for
[57:24] the strength in my body. Praise the
[57:27] Lord. Oh, how we can say, Lord, teach us
[57:29] how to pray. Amen. I don't know about
[57:32] you, but uh I feel like there Lord teach
[57:35] us how to pray.
[57:40] Amen. You love the Lord
[57:43] tonight. Praise the
[57:46] Lord.
[57:49] [Music]
[57:53] Amen. Oh my my my
[57:57] my. What a wonderful Jesus we serve.
[58:00] Praise the
[58:03] Lord. Let's take our Bibles tonight.
[58:07] Let's take our Bible tonight
[58:18] and St. John chapter 13.
[58:36] I wanted to make the entire night a
[58:38] prayer meeting tonight, but I started
[58:40] feeling that I was losing you and I
[58:43] didn't want you to stray on me.
[58:45] Amen. It gets it gets difficult when
[58:49] people start going astray in prayer. St.
[58:52] John chapter 13. This is just an
[58:55] exitation
[58:57] tonight. Amen.
[59:10] St. John chapter 13, let's read
[59:14] uh verse
[59:17] 33. St. John chapter 13, let's read
[59:20] verse
[59:22] 33. Let's read from verse 31 anyway to
[59:26] verse 35. It gave us a good scripture
[59:29] reading tonight.
[59:31] Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus
[59:35] said, "Now is the son of man glorified,
[59:39] and God is glorified in him." Praise the
[59:44] Lord. How is the son of man glorified?
[59:47] When God is glorified in him. Praise the
[59:52] Lord. Amen.
[59:54] So when uh uh Jesus says glorify me with
[59:58] the glory that I had from the beginning
[1:00:01] is God. When God is reflecting himself,
[1:00:04] when God is glorifying himself in you,
[1:00:07] praise the
[1:00:08] Lord. If God be
[1:00:11] glorified in him, God shall also glorify
[1:00:15] him in
[1:00:16] himself and shall straightway glorify
[1:00:19] him.
[1:00:21] Little
[1:00:22] children, yet a little while I am with
[1:00:26] you, yet shall seek me. And as I said
[1:00:30] unto the Jews, whether I go, ye cannot
[1:00:34] come, so now I say unto you. Praise the
[1:00:39] Lord. Amen.
[1:00:42] A new
[1:00:43] commandment I give unto you, that ye
[1:00:47] love one another, as I have loved you,
[1:00:52] that ye also love one
[1:00:54] another. By this shall all men know that
[1:00:58] ye are my disciple, if you love one
[1:01:01] another. Let's pray together. Heavenly
[1:01:03] Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:06] Christ, we want to thank you tonight.
[1:01:08] Thank you for giving us a little session
[1:01:11] of prayer, Lord. Oh God, it's not uh uh
[1:01:16] how many hours how we would love to just
[1:01:18] spend an hour with you in prayer, 30
[1:01:22] minutes, Lord God, but it's just that
[1:01:24] moment season to the moment, Lord, where
[1:01:27] we can just let go and let God have his
[1:01:30] way, where we can just so father try to
[1:01:34] let our our problems off our mind and
[1:01:37] and and our failures off our mind and
[1:01:40] just be able to stand with uplifted hand
[1:01:43] and say, "Lord, I love you. Thank you,
[1:01:46] Father." And oh God. So we pray tonight
[1:01:49] that Lord, you would take from our
[1:01:50] hearts. Take from the hearts of your
[1:01:52] children tonight. Oh God, when your
[1:01:55] angels gathered prayers, Lord, take from
[1:01:57] our hearts, oh Father God, what was
[1:02:00] offered unto you, oh God. Father, we uh
[1:02:03] and and Lord Jesus, may it burn before
[1:02:06] you, oh God, a a smoke of remembrance,
[1:02:10] Lord. Oh father, we pray that God you
[1:02:12] will remember us. You know the needs of

[1:03:48] you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. The Lord
[1:03:53] bless you. You may have your seat. And
[1:03:56] uh uh this is uh uh a little inspiration
[1:04:00] that struck my mind. I mean many of you
[1:04:03] might be uh familiar with the thought on
[1:04:07] the 11 commandment. I want to I want to
[1:04:09] speak a little bit on the 11
[1:04:10] commandment. Uh
[1:04:13] uh on the 11th commandment Jesus said a
[1:04:17] new commandment I
[1:04:19] gave I give unto you. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:24] So, I want to look at that
[1:04:26] tonight. And uh
[1:04:36] uh you know, sometimes you have
[1:04:40] uh you have that thought, you know, uh
[1:04:44] uh kind of blessing
[1:04:48] you and
[1:04:50] uh you don't want to keep it.
[1:04:54] That's what preachers like too much
[1:04:56] talking because there is just a too much
[1:04:59] they have to talk about and they don't
[1:05:01] have enough time to talk all about
[1:05:03] it. And so tonight I want to just I just
[1:05:07] want to speak a little bit on the 11
[1:05:08] commandment. Now you realize that this
[1:05:11] is this is very familiar to John
[1:05:13] writing. He write this in the in the in
[1:05:17] uh
[1:05:20] uh he write this in his episode of St.
[1:05:23] John and he also write this in uh 1
[1:05:29] John. Let's turn to 1 John chapter
[1:05:31] 2. 1 John chapter
[1:05:34] 2. Let's turn to 1 John chapter 2.
[1:05:49] What is the need of a new commandment?
[1:05:52] What is the need of an 11 commandment
[1:05:55] when the 10th was never
[1:06:00] kept? Praise the Lord. What is the need
[1:06:03] of an 11 commandment when the 10 10 was
[1:06:06] never kept?
[1:06:08] Let's look at uh uh 1 John chapter 2
[1:06:11] tonight 9:7. Brethrens, I write no new
[1:06:15] commandment unto you, but an old
[1:06:19] commandment which ye have
[1:06:22] heard, which ye had from the beginning.
[1:06:26] The old commandment is the word which ye
[1:06:30] have heard from the beginning. Verse
[1:06:34] eight again, a new commandment I write
[1:06:37] unto you, which things is truth of him
[1:06:41] and in you because the darkness is
[1:06:45] passed and the true light now shine.
[1:06:51] Praise the Lord. Amen. He says this is
[1:06:55] not a new commandment. The 11
[1:06:58] commandment is not a new
[1:06:59] commandment. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:03] Amen. But he again he says it's a new
[1:07:08] commandment. It's not a new commandment,
[1:07:10] but it's a new
[1:07:11] commandment. Are we together?
[1:07:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:19] Uh, I'm going to rub myself tonight
[1:07:23] because uh I had I had a subject that uh
[1:07:29] uh I've been I've been studying on the
[1:07:32] lawgiver
[1:07:34] uh that I wanted to to preach on. So
[1:07:38] this is this is just a part of it
[1:07:40] tonight. This is just an exitation.
[1:07:43] Amen. This is just an hesitation. So
[1:07:46] just just bear with
[1:07:48] me. Just bear with
[1:07:50] me. What a wonderful Jesus we serve.
[1:07:53] Amen. We want to thank the Lord also for
[1:07:56] uh the message our brother brought on on
[1:08:00] Sunday. Well, there was a beautiful
[1:08:01] exitation right there in the book of uh
[1:08:05] of
[1:08:05] Esther. Praise the Lord. Amen. And you
[1:08:09] know when you look in the the books of
[1:08:11] the
[1:08:12] Bible, if I'm if I'm right, if I'm
[1:08:15] wrong, tell me. There are two books that
[1:08:18] is named
[1:08:20] after
[1:08:22] women. The book of
[1:08:24] Esther and the book of Ruth. Praise the
[1:08:28] Lord.
[1:08:30] If you just look at the same, that's
[1:08:32] what I wanted to talk on tonight, but
[1:08:33] why we were praying my my thoughts went
[1:08:36] today. So just look at the same and uh
[1:08:40] both of them are the books of
[1:08:42] redemption. Esther speaks of the Jewish
[1:08:50] redemption. It speaks of the Jewish
[1:08:53] redemption. God play out the redemption
[1:08:57] of the Jewish
[1:08:58] people in a in a
[1:09:01] drama in the life of Hassaris the king.
[1:09:06] and with Esther coming into the picture.
[1:09:10] Now remember now the book of Esther is a
[1:09:14] gentile king with a Jewish
[1:09:18] queen. The book of Ruth is a Jewish
[1:09:24] uh uh uh uh law of the harvest. Boaz was
[1:09:29] a Jewish
[1:09:30] man and Ruth was a gentile woman.
[1:09:36] Do you see the beautiful design as the
[1:09:39] book of Esther speaks about the Jewish
[1:09:42] redemption and we can be brought into a
[1:09:46] bat type.
[1:09:48] Praise the Lord. Amen. I mean a lot of
[1:09:52] scholars talk talk against the book of
[1:09:54] Esther only because they say well I mean
[1:09:57] uh it does not have the name of God
[1:09:59] which of course uh that is that that is
[1:10:01] a subject for another day. and uh uh uh
[1:10:04] but uh Jewish students has proven that
[1:10:07] the name of God is hidden in the text.
[1:10:10] Now the name Esther actually in the
[1:10:13] Hebrew is Hester. Hester which mean
[1:10:16] hidden. Okay.
[1:10:20] It means
[1:10:22] hidden. So God uh just like he hid uh
[1:10:27] caused a darkness on the earth and then
[1:10:29] he hid those three sacred virtue in a
[1:10:32] woman that is the very same thing he's
[1:10:34] doing right here in the book of Esther.
[1:10:37] It's about
[1:10:38] redemption now. So we see uh it speaks
[1:10:41] about the the the the the Jewish
[1:10:44] redemption, a gentile king, a Jewish
[1:10:46] bride over in the book of Ruth that
[1:10:49] speaks about the gentile redemption.
[1:10:52] Book of Esther, Jewish redemption, book
[1:10:54] of Ruth, gentile redemption. So it
[1:10:57] turned out that the Lord of the harvest,
[1:10:59] Boaz, is a is a is a Jew. And Ruth that
[1:11:04] would end up being the bride is a
[1:11:07] gentile woman. So you see how God keep
[1:11:10] balance all over the place. Amen. Praise
[1:11:13] the Lord. Solomon says God is not a God
[1:11:16] of false balance. The Lord do not like
[1:11:19] false balance. He love true balance. You
[1:11:22] love the Lord tonight.
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:26] Amen. So uh uh uh we're talking about
[1:11:30] the 11 commandment. I keep uh you know
[1:11:33] running my mouth and never get to my my
[1:11:35] text tonight.
[1:11:39] What is the need of an 11? Why why
[1:11:43] should Jesus come and says uh uh I give
[1:11:48] you a new
[1:11:51] commandment? Why should there be an
[1:11:55] 11 when the when the entire Bible tells
[1:11:58] us that the ten commandments were never
[1:12:04] kept? Are we together? Amen. Praise the
[1:12:07] Lord. Exodus chapter
[1:12:10] 19. Like I said, I will rub myself
[1:12:12] tonight, but that's
[1:12:15] okay. I'm going into something that I
[1:12:17] would have loved to speak about when I
[1:12:20] have two or three hours to
[1:12:24] preach. I can do it when the service has
[1:12:26] already ended.
[1:12:28] Amen. And there is just 30 minutes
[1:12:30] before me. Now, Exodus chapter 19. When
[1:12:33] you look in Exodus chapter
[1:12:38] 19, this this uh this chapter was where
[1:12:44] Israel
[1:12:46] committed their one of their filter
[1:12:50] mistake.
[1:12:52] Amen. Listen to this. Let's read
[1:12:57] together. Verse n uh chapter 19 verse
[1:13:00] one. In a ter moment, when the children
[1:13:02] of Israel were gone forth out of the
[1:13:04] land of Egypt, the same day came they
[1:13:07] unto the wilderness of Sinai. For they
[1:13:10] were departed from uh Raphid, and were
[1:13:14] come to the desert of Sinai, and had
[1:13:17] pitched in the wilderness, and there
[1:13:20] Israel camp before the mount. And Moses
[1:13:23] went up unto God, and the Lord called
[1:13:27] unto him out of the mountain, saying,
[1:13:30] Thus shalt thou say to the house of
[1:13:34] Jacob, and tell the children of Israel,
[1:13:37] thus shall thou say, thus shalt thou
[1:13:42] say
[1:13:44] that this is the way you should command
[1:13:46] them. No, say this to them. Praise the
[1:13:50] Lord. Amen. Do you do you do you realize
[1:13:53] that what Israel was facing here many of
[1:13:56] the time we are sitting in that same
[1:13:59] seat whenever the word is preached even
[1:14:02] a a word of encouragement always comes
[1:14:06] to us like there is some kind of a
[1:14:08] commandment we should
[1:14:10] do there is something that we should
[1:14:12] keep. So even at the time that God is is
[1:14:16] telling you that he love you, you are
[1:14:19] looking around. I mean how good was I
[1:14:22] today?
[1:14:25] Are we together? That is the very same
[1:14:28] seat that Israel was sitting in right
[1:14:30] here. Listen to this. Uh uh uh thus
[1:14:33] shall thou say to the house of Jacob,
[1:14:35] tell the children of Israel, I have seen
[1:14:39] what I did unto the Egyptians.
[1:14:43] Okay. Ye have seen,
[1:14:45] sorry, ye have seen what I did unto the
[1:14:49] Egyptians and how I b you on eagle wings
[1:14:55] and brought you to
[1:14:58] myself. That was grace.
[1:15:02] That was the grace of God. Amen.
[1:15:07] I b you on eagle wings which mean I went
[1:15:11] down and I pick you up.
[1:15:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:17] Amen. Now watch the conversation. Now uh
[1:15:21] uh uh uh you have seen what I did to the
[1:15:23] Egyptians.
[1:15:26] Amen. For me to get you
[1:15:33] out, I have
[1:15:36] to visit Egypt 10
[1:15:40] times. 10 notice notable
[1:15:44] times called the 10 plagues.
[1:15:50] God is trying to to to magnify something
[1:15:54] to them for them to be able to
[1:15:56] appreciate the
[1:15:58] grace that have brought
[1:16:01] them. You all were right there. The
[1:16:04] water turned into blood, but you still
[1:16:07] have fresh drinking water in your house.
[1:16:10] You were right there when frogs were all
[1:16:12] over the
[1:16:14] place. Guushian was kept away from that.
[1:16:19] You saw how I dare with the
[1:16:24] Egyptians. Are we together? Amen. Amen.
[1:16:28] God trying to to uh uh magnify his grace
[1:16:33] for us to appreciate it. That's all he
[1:16:36] needs from
[1:16:38] us. A little sense of appreciation.
[1:16:42] Not what you can do, what you can keep,
[1:16:44] and what what you can tell.
[1:16:50] You were there when
[1:16:52] darkness were all over
[1:16:55] Egypt. You saw the darkness. The Bible
[1:16:58] says it was so dark that you can touch
[1:17:01] it. It had a feeling. Scare it.
[1:17:07] Haunting. Are we together?
[1:17:11] Yeah. have seen what I did unto the
[1:17:14] Egyptians and how I b you in the midst
[1:17:18] of all of that. I kept you from the
[1:17:20] balls that were falling on their flesh.
[1:17:23] I kept you from the the the the less
[1:17:26] that went all through their beds and
[1:17:28] their their
[1:17:29] their homes and and and everything that
[1:17:32] was breaking on their body. I kept you
[1:17:34] from all of that. Yeah.
[1:17:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:40] Are we together? How I b you on eagle
[1:17:45] wings and I brought you unto myself. Now
[1:17:48] listen now, this is where it gets
[1:17:52] tricky. Now
[1:17:54] therefore, if ye will obey my voice
[1:17:59] indeed and keep my
[1:18:02] covenant, watch this now. Amen. Because
[1:18:07] this is where this could turn to look to
[1:18:10] you like a
[1:18:13] commment. The question I should ask you
[1:18:16] is that they obey his voice before he
[1:18:19] brought them out. Were they obeying his
[1:18:22] voice before he sent
[1:18:25] Moses? They have gone away from the
[1:18:27] Lord. They were not even worshiping
[1:18:30] God before he sent Moses. Were they
[1:18:33] worshiping? Were they keeping his
[1:18:35] commandment?
[1:18:38] Now, so how will we think that a
[1:18:43] people whose heart was already against
[1:18:46] God, their heart was against God?
[1:18:49] Because they were thinking in their
[1:18:50] mind, how can we be called the children
[1:18:52] of Abraham? How can we say Abraham, the
[1:18:55] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and
[1:18:58] yet we are our
[1:18:59] slaves? They were not serving God. Their
[1:19:02] heart was already hiding against God.
[1:19:06] That's the reason why they could not
[1:19:07] receive
[1:19:10] Moses. Now, how will we think that God
[1:19:14] will be now requiring them to keep his
[1:19:17] commandment? You can't keep the
[1:19:19] commandment with an unconverted heart.
[1:19:21] Yeah. Right.
[1:19:26] It is God expressing his love.
[1:19:29] God trying to show you your state of
[1:19:33] life that he took you out of. If you can
[1:19:36] appreciate that, amen. Then you will
[1:19:40] appreciate when he take you to the next
[1:19:42] state.
[1:19:45] Praise the Lord. But what we do is that
[1:19:48] we feel like we feel
[1:19:51] like we have worked hard to come to this
[1:19:54] state of life. And Lord, I have done all
[1:19:58] of this to be to this place. Why are you
[1:20:01] not taking me to the next place? That's
[1:20:04] what we
[1:20:05] do. Let's read a little bit. Now
[1:20:07] therefore, if you obey my voice indeed
[1:20:10] and keep my my covenant, then ye shall
[1:20:14] be a peculiar
[1:20:17] treasure unto me above all people, for
[1:20:22] all the earth is mine.
[1:20:25] Are we together?
[1:20:28] Now see, God is expressing his desire
[1:20:31] that the way he's thinking about these
[1:20:33] people. Amen. I bring you out on eagle
[1:20:39] wings. This is my thought concerning
[1:20:41] you. My thought. I want to make you a
[1:20:44] peculiar treasure. Yes.
[1:20:48] If I can strike a whole nation because
[1:20:50] of
[1:20:53] you. If I can come against all the
[1:20:56] denomination and forget about their
[1:20:58] decrees and and pull you out for my
[1:21:01] name's
[1:21:03] sake is because this is what I want to
[1:21:06] make out of you. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:21:10] This is what I want to make out of you.
[1:21:12] I want to make you a peculiar treasure
[1:21:15] above all the people for all the earth
[1:21:17] is mine. and ye shall be unto me a whole
[1:21:21] a a a kingdom of priests and a holy
[1:21:25] nation. These are the words which thou
[1:21:28] shall speak unto the children of
[1:21:31] Israel. But you see many of the time is
[1:21:35] that the way we understand things when
[1:21:38] they are spoken to us is all because of
[1:21:41] our state of mind. Many times it's not
[1:21:44] what the person is saying, it's the
[1:21:47] state of mind that you are in. If you
[1:21:49] are in an angry state of
[1:21:53] mind, you will say, "Why are you
[1:21:55] laughing at me?" when the person is not
[1:21:56] even laughing. Why are you teasing me?
[1:21:59] It's because your state of mind is
[1:22:02] wrong.
[1:22:05] Yeah. Are we together? Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:09] It's sometimes it's not what the person
[1:22:11] said. Right. Right. It is your state of
[1:22:14] mind that you are in.
[1:22:16] So these people are in a slave state of
[1:22:20] mind. They are in a state of mind where
[1:22:23] they are whipped. They are commanded to
[1:22:25] do
[1:22:26] everything. So God expressing his
[1:22:30] thoughts and his desire to his people.
[1:22:33] They are taking it as a commandment.
[1:22:36] Are we together? Amen. Amen.
[1:22:40] And Moses came and called the others of
[1:22:42] the people and laid before before their
[1:22:45] their faces all these words which the
[1:22:48] Lord commanded
[1:22:52] him. And all the people answered
[1:22:55] together.
[1:22:58] All the people answered
[1:23:01] together and said, "All that the Lord
[1:23:05] has spoken, we will do."
[1:23:09] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. That was a
[1:23:13] filthy mistake.
[1:23:17] That was a filter error that he made.
[1:23:23] You never did nothing for God to bring
[1:23:25] you out.
[1:23:27] He only remember his promise to Abraham.
[1:23:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:34] He remember his promise after 400 years.
[1:23:37] I will come down with a mighty hand and
[1:23:39] I will bring. God was remembering his
[1:23:41] promise. He was not rewarding the people
[1:23:44] because of their good work. Right? It
[1:23:47] was their rejection and attitude that
[1:23:49] ran Moses into the wilderness.
[1:23:56] So you see this was what bir the ten
[1:24:00] commandments. God showed them grace. I
[1:24:04] brought you out on eagle wings. The
[1:24:06] people call for Lord all that the Lord
[1:24:09] says we will
[1:24:13] do. God gave them grace. Show them
[1:24:16] grace. You see what I did to the
[1:24:19] Egyptians and I gather you. I brought
[1:24:22] you. I pick you
[1:24:26] up. You walk through a Red Sea where you
[1:24:29] did not have to split.
[1:24:32] You had enough strength to walk faster
[1:24:35] than Gerro that was running on wheels.
[1:24:42] God showing a grace to his people for us
[1:24:46] to
[1:24:49] appreciate. And then we are counting
[1:24:52] which commandment we kept and which one
[1:24:54] we broke.
[1:24:56] When just the breaking of one is the
[1:24:58] breaking of all. Right.
[1:25:02] Are we together? Amen.
[1:25:05] Amen. Amen. Brother says, you know, our
[1:25:09] our decent dress is just a just an
[1:25:12] appreciation to the Lord. Amen. The way
[1:25:15] we dress, the things that we do is it's
[1:25:18] not a commment.
[1:25:20] or this church or not believe in women
[1:25:22] wearing trousers. That's that's not
[1:25:29] truth. It's not a commandment. It's a
[1:25:32] life of appreciation.
[1:25:34] Amen. Because we have we have we we we
[1:25:38] have uh by God's grace we have come to
[1:25:41] identify
[1:25:44] decency. Amen.
[1:25:48] And what we what we teach and encourage
[1:25:50] is decency. I went out there as a young
[1:25:52] lady. I was coming to church here and
[1:25:54] went to see her mother and I visiting
[1:25:56] with them and and and you know mother
[1:25:58] and daughter uh been away for for many
[1:26:01] years and she came to join her mom and
[1:26:03] uh you know and I just telling the mom
[1:26:06] you know I just I just came to you know
[1:26:08] let you know yeah your daughter come to
[1:26:09] church with us and and u uh I just
[1:26:12] wanted you to know you know uh uh and if
[1:26:15] there's any question and all of that as
[1:26:18] we talk along she said yeah you know
[1:26:19] this thing uh uh uh I Oh, my daughter
[1:26:23] any clothes I buy for her, she don't she
[1:26:25] don't like to wear it, you know. She
[1:26:27] just dressing like a old lady in house
[1:26:29] and all of that. I knew where that where
[1:26:32] that conversation was going, you know.
[1:26:34] And so she wanted to know whether it was
[1:26:36] uh it was a it was a law in the church.
[1:26:39] I said, "No, it's not a law in the
[1:26:41] church. No, no, it's not a law in the
[1:26:44] church." So I got God talking with her.
[1:26:47] I gave her the long row and I hang her.
[1:26:49] Amen.
[1:26:52] you know, and she said, she said, "Yeah,
[1:26:54] I remember. I remember, you know, uh uh
[1:26:57] uh uh I know I used to go to church back
[1:27:00] then, and that's how we used to dress."
[1:27:01] I said, "But then where did it
[1:27:03] go? Where did it
[1:27:05] go? It's just an appreciation for
[1:27:08] decency." Okay, let's get back to what
[1:27:09] we're talking about tonight. Praise the
[1:27:12] Lord. Amen. So, God God showed grace to
[1:27:16] the people. The people ask for Lord all
[1:27:19] that the Lord says we will
[1:27:24] do. Praise the
[1:27:27] Lord. When you read that statement, it
[1:27:30] might appear and sound like it's an
[1:27:32] earnest
[1:27:35] statement. And we do the
[1:27:38] same. You know, I've I love the Lord
[1:27:41] now. You know, I'm I'm I you know, I I
[1:27:44] love the message. You know, I stand for
[1:27:45] the word
[1:27:47] and stand for
[1:27:51] what? If God don't give you grace, you
[1:27:53] be crying on your belly. That's right.
[1:27:57] That's right. Amen. He told King, he
[1:28:00] says, uh h sin desire you. He will seek
[1:28:04] after you.
[1:28:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:11] And every man born in sin, we face that.
[1:28:13] It runs after us every day. It's all in
[1:28:16] the street. You even close the door and
[1:28:18] stay home alone. It's dead. It's bugging
[1:28:20] your mind. If the grace of God don't
[1:28:23] help you, you crawl on your
[1:28:27] belly. And all the people answered
[1:28:30] together and said, "All that the Lord
[1:28:34] has spoken, we will do." Moses
[1:28:37] returned. the words of the people unto
[1:28:40] the
[1:28:41] Lord and you will see right from there
[1:28:44] on God approached the people completely
[1:28:47] different.
[1:28:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:52] That was the birth of the ten
[1:28:55] commandments.
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:29:01] That was the birth of the ten
[1:29:02] commandment. But but see you see what
[1:29:04] see the beauty of the Lord.
[1:29:07] All that the Lord said you will
[1:29:09] do. Hello God talking to the people now.
[1:29:12] Moses really all that he said they are
[1:29:15] telling you that everything I said they
[1:29:17] will do. Okay. I strike Israel with 10
[1:29:21] plagues. I'll give them ten commandments
[1:29:23] to see if they will keep
[1:29:30] it. I strike Israel with 10
[1:29:33] pledges. So if they if they will do all
[1:29:36] that I will say, if that is the way they
[1:29:38] will
[1:29:39] appreciate what I have done for them by
[1:29:42] works, then let me give them 10
[1:29:47] commandments. Each commandment for a
[1:29:49] plague.
[1:29:56] Are we together?
[1:29:58] If we think there the way to appreciate
[1:30:01] what God has done for us is by our
[1:30:06] works. No, it's a spirit of gratitude.
[1:30:10] A spirit of gratitude that is in your
[1:30:13] heart.
[1:30:17] A spirit of gratitude that you are not
[1:30:20] afraid to say thank you Jesus. When even
[1:30:23] people think you are losing your mind,
[1:30:25] you can say thank you Jesus. Because you
[1:30:28] are filled with a spirit of gratitude.
[1:30:35] Young people, you don't have to be
[1:30:36] ashamed to pray for your fool in public.
[1:30:38] Yeah. You want to be filled with the
[1:30:40] spirit of gratitude. Yeah.
[1:30:47] I gave you one commandment for the
[1:30:48] plague. Just imagine now if God will
[1:30:51] look at our life and the things that he
[1:30:53] have done for us, the things he has
[1:30:54] saved us from and he will give you one
[1:30:57] commandment for everything that he have
[1:30:59] done for
[1:31:02] you. Will we ever come out of that? No.
[1:31:05] No, we will not. No, we will not. Are we
[1:31:10] together tonight? Is the picture coming
[1:31:12] together?
[1:31:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:17] Amen.
[1:31:23] So, but uh the the ten commandment was
[1:31:25] birthed. You go right down there and you
[1:31:27] see what the ten commandment
[1:31:30] is.
[1:31:39] Hallelujah. What a wonderful Jesus we
[1:31:42] serve. Amen.
[1:31:44] What a wonderful Jesus.
[1:31:48] we
[1:31:51] serve. Oh, praise the
[1:31:54] Lord. Look, what will happen
[1:31:58] here? What will happen?
[1:32:18] Jesus Jesus would take
[1:32:21] uh he would take
[1:32:24] the ten
[1:32:26] commandments. He would take the ten
[1:32:28] commandments. Let's look in Luke chapter
[1:32:30] 15.
[1:32:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:01] Luke chapter 15. Is that what I said?
[1:33:05] Luke chapter 10.
[1:33:11] Luke chapter
[1:33:20] 10. Luke chapter 10. Let's read from
[1:33:23] verse 25. And behold, a certain lawyer
[1:33:26] stood up. Lawyer, which means someone
[1:33:28] that studied the word, and tempted him,
[1:33:31] saying, "Master, what shall I do to
[1:33:34] inherit eternal life?"
[1:33:38] He said unto him, "What is written in
[1:33:41] the Lord, and how readth
[1:33:45] thou?" What is written in the
[1:33:49] commandment? And how do you read
[1:33:53] it? You read it as a
[1:33:57] commandment, but do you see the grace of
[1:34:00] God and the love of God in it? Now, see
[1:34:03] what he says here.
[1:34:06] He said unto him, "What is written in
[1:34:08] the Lord?" What is written in the Lord?
[1:34:12] And how
[1:34:14] readth and this guy said unto him, And
[1:34:17] he answered and said, "Thou shalt love
[1:34:19] the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
[1:34:21] all thy soul, and all your strength, and
[1:34:23] all your
[1:34:24] mind, and thy neighbor as thyself."
[1:34:29] And he said unto him, Jesus said unto
[1:34:32] him, "Thou hath answered right, this do
[1:34:36] and thou shalt live." Praise the Lord.
[1:34:40] Amen.
[1:34:43] Now, so you see it
[1:34:45] here.
[1:34:47] Jesus
[1:34:49] took the ten
[1:34:52] commandments and he place it into two.
[1:34:56] Love the Lord with all of your heart.
[1:34:59] Love your neighbor as
[1:35:03] yourself. If you love the Lord with all
[1:35:05] of your heart, you will respect the
[1:35:06] Sabbath day.
[1:35:09] If you love your neighbor as yourself,
[1:35:10] you will not covert. You will not steal.
[1:35:14] You will not bear false witness. So he
[1:35:16] took the commandments and then he break
[1:35:19] it into two.
[1:35:23] Praise the Lord. Amen. Love the Lord
[1:35:25] with all of your heart, all of your
[1:35:27] mind, all of your strength, and then
[1:35:30] love your neighbor as
[1:35:34] yourself. Are we together?
[1:35:37] Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, but he's
[1:35:40] dealing with a Pharisees here. He
[1:35:42] dealing with a a
[1:35:44] scride. He says, "Well, you know this.
[1:35:47] Well, that's right. Then go do
[1:35:49] it. Go and do it.
[1:35:53] If you are looking for what to do to
[1:35:55] please God, go do it. Go
[1:35:59] try. Go do it. Go through an entire day
[1:36:03] where you will not complain about
[1:36:07] somebody. If it's not somebody dressing
[1:36:10] wrong, a driver on the street, go where
[1:36:12] somebody will cut before you and say,
[1:36:14] "Oh, I love you for cutting before me."
[1:36:22] Good. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:36:27] But if you watch it, Jesus just before
[1:36:30] he will leave his
[1:36:32] disciple, he will come and then he will
[1:36:35] say this to them. A new commandment I
[1:36:38] gave you.
[1:36:42] Now you have to realize in Matthew
[1:36:44] chapter 5 Jesus said I have not come to
[1:36:46] do away with the law.
[1:36:49] No I have come to fulfill it. Amen. So
[1:36:53] he was not getting the rate of the 10.
[1:36:55] He was giving you another
[1:36:58] one. Praise the Lord. He was giving you
[1:37:02] another one. We I can't even take care
[1:37:04] of two. Then you adding another one to
[1:37:06] it.
[1:37:08] What was the importance of the 11
[1:37:10] commandment? If we can't keep the the
[1:37:12] the
[1:37:14] 10th, it's because the 11
[1:37:18] commandment
[1:37:20] held the revelation of the 10th.
[1:37:26] The 11 commandment held the revelation
[1:37:29] of the 10th. The 11 commandment have the
[1:37:32] fulfillment of the 10th.
[1:37:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:39] Are we together?
[1:37:42] Let's go back to that
[1:37:45] again. Glory be to God. You love the
[1:37:49] Lord tonight. It's just uh just uh uh
[1:37:52] you know
[1:37:55] uh it just uh how can we call it now?
[1:37:58] Prayer meeting tonight. So just bear
[1:38:01] with me. Matthew chapter
[1:38:03] 13, Jesus says, "A new commandment I
[1:38:07] give unto you, that ye love one
[1:38:11] another as I have loved
[1:38:15] you, that ye also love one another."
[1:38:20] Praise the Lord. That's the fulfillment
[1:38:24] of the thing.
[1:38:27] It was his
[1:38:29] love that brought him down into
[1:38:33] Egypt. It was his love that watched over
[1:38:37] h Joseph when he was sold. It was his
[1:38:40] love that was keeping the promise he
[1:38:43] gave to to
[1:38:46] Abraham. It was his love. God said, "For
[1:38:49] my servant David's
[1:38:51] sake, there will always be a seed on the
[1:38:54] throne of Israel. Even if his children
[1:38:58] sin, if they repent, I will forgive
[1:39:01] their iniquity. If they don't repent, I
[1:39:03] will still raise up one for my name's
[1:39:06] sake. That's God's love. It does not
[1:39:10] have anything to do with our works.
[1:39:14] Yeah.
[1:39:20] Are we together? Amen.
[1:39:25] Why do we need another one?
[1:39:29] When we couldn't keep the 10th. But here
[1:39:32] in this one, Jesus was actually bringing
[1:39:35] us the ingredients of the ten
[1:39:37] commandments.
[1:39:39] That it was not a commandment to whip
[1:39:43] you and make you guilty all the days of
[1:39:46] your life. But all I was doing, I was
[1:39:48] show as I have loved
[1:39:51] you. As I have loved you, love one
[1:39:54] another.
[1:39:59] Praise the Lord. Amen. As I have loved
[1:40:02] you, if we if we can appreciate the
[1:40:05] grace of God to our life, we will have
[1:40:08] grace on people.
[1:40:11] Praise the Lord. It will not be
[1:40:13] difficult to say, "I'm sorry." when you
[1:40:15] are wrong. Yeah.
[1:40:23] You don't have to even beg for sire and
[1:40:25] be looking through the window. When will
[1:40:26] they come and say sorry? Jesus said when
[1:40:28] your brother offend you, you go to him.
[1:40:31] Yeah. Because you have experienced the
[1:40:32] love of God. That love of God will draw
[1:40:35] push you to go and reconcile. Amen.
[1:40:38] Amen. You will not accept rules and
[1:40:40] regulation when you pass this 10 step
[1:40:42] before I will forgive you.
[1:40:48] The 11
[1:40:50] commandment. A new commandment give I
[1:40:53] unto you that ye love one another as I
[1:40:57] have loved you that ye love one
[1:41:02] another. Love the Lord with all of your
[1:41:05] heart, all of your mind, all of your
[1:41:07] strength. Everything that is within you,
[1:41:11] you are able to bring it on a
[1:41:14] subjuggestion to God's word. You are
[1:41:16] able to bring it on a subjection to
[1:41:18] God's love.
[1:41:23] Because I love the Lord, I would not
[1:41:24] want to hurt him.
[1:41:28] I realize that my action, my choices
[1:41:31] will hurt him.
[1:41:36] That's when you are you are experiencing
[1:41:38] the love of God. That's when it has
[1:41:40] drive home to you.
[1:41:42] It's not just a word that is used in the
[1:41:45] mouth. It's something that is
[1:41:47] experienced.
[1:41:50] Something that we all have experienced.
[1:41:52] God's love has been going after
[1:41:57] us. Why can't we give it to another
[1:42:00] person? And Jesus said, "By this, by
[1:42:04] this 11 commandment, all men will
[1:42:09] know, all men know whether that ye are
[1:42:12] my
[1:42:13] disciples by this 11 commandment."
[1:42:19] Praise the
[1:42:23] Lord. The 11th had the life of the 10th.
[1:42:29] The 10 had no life in it.
[1:42:34] The 11 had the life of the
[1:42:38] 10th. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:44] Parents, obey or I mean children, obey
[1:42:46] your
[1:42:47] parents. Command me in the Lord. If the
[1:42:50] 11 does not drop in your heart, you want
[1:42:53] to love them because they good to you.
[1:42:55] You love them because they give you this
[1:42:56] and that.
[1:42:59] But then when they correct you by the
[1:43:00] word, you get
[1:43:05] angry. The 11 had the life of the
[1:43:11] 10th. The 11 had the ingredient of the
[1:43:17] 10th. A new
[1:43:20] commandment have I given to you.
[1:43:23] John says, I realize this is not a new
[1:43:26] commandment. is the same old but again
[1:43:29] it's a new commandment.
[1:43:36] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:43:39] The 11th
[1:43:45] commandment. When you break into the
[1:43:47] 11th commandment, you don't have fear.
[1:43:50] If you stay with the ten commandment,
[1:43:52] you have fear. Oh yeah. Because if you
[1:43:54] break one, you are guilty of
[1:43:57] all. But when you enter into the 11
[1:44:00] commandment, there is no fear.
[1:44:03] Praise the Lord. There is no fear.
[1:44:07] Whether you have to keep it from up down
[1:44:09] or from down up or in the middle down
[1:44:12] and up, you it does not bother
[1:44:15] you. You just love the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:19] M you just love the Lord because you
[1:44:23] realize he first love you when you were
[1:44:26] unlovable.
[1:44:30] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:44:32] You just love him. You can't explain it.
[1:44:34] You can't tell
[1:44:37] why. You can't explain it. You can't put
[1:44:40] God love to such things
[1:44:44] because he, you know, he he he he he
[1:44:46] gave me a house because he gave. You
[1:44:48] can't put God love to such things. Those
[1:44:50] are perishable things.
[1:44:52] His love is in tenor.
[1:45:00] Are we together? Amen. His love is in
[1:45:06] tenor and all he's all he's trying to do
[1:45:10] trying to grab us and say appreciate it
[1:45:13] once appreciate the little things.
[1:45:19] Don't look for big things. Look for
[1:45:21] things around you every day that you can
[1:45:23] appreciate. Amen.
[1:45:31] Try to have a grateful heart. Learn to
[1:45:34] say thank
[1:45:36] you. Learn to say thank
[1:45:40] you. Have a grateful heart. Let it let
[1:45:43] it just
[1:45:48] flow. You know that you know those kind
[1:45:50] of a thank you where you tell somebody
[1:45:52] thank you. He said, "For what?" Because
[1:45:54] it hit him right in the
[1:45:58] face. Not the not the one where you say
[1:46:01] it says thank you. You say
[1:46:04] what? When the person say you say what?
[1:46:06] Because the thank you is dragging. It's
[1:46:09] so
[1:46:10] dry. It don't have feelings in it. Thank
[1:46:14] you. You say what? Oh, I said thank you.
[1:46:17] Oh, I said thank
[1:46:18] you. But he said, "Thank you for what?"
[1:46:23] Because it hit them right in the
[1:46:26] face. It come right out of a grateful
[1:46:30] heart. That's all he want us to do. Just
[1:46:33] to be
[1:46:34] grateful. Just to be
[1:46:38] grateful, just to be
[1:46:45] thankful. The musicians can come
[1:46:48] tonight. I said this was a prayer
[1:46:50] meeting. I'm beginning to feel the the
[1:46:52] the feeling of preaching coming on me
[1:46:54] now.
[1:46:55] So, praise the Lord. Amen. But this is
[1:46:58] just to kind of for encourage you
[1:47:00] tonight. That's the reason
[1:47:02] why there must be a 10 because it has
[1:47:05] the life I mean a 11 because the 11 have
[1:47:09] the life of the
[1:47:11] 10th. The 11 have the ingredients of the
[1:47:14] 10. The 10 were deadly. An eye for an
[1:47:17] eye.
[1:47:19] a tooth for a
[1:47:21] tooth. It was
[1:47:25] deadly because of that. Read the
[1:47:30] scripture. Israel only had a city of
[1:47:33] refuge for their people. They never had
[1:47:34] no praising. They don't send you to
[1:47:36] praising. You break the commandment,
[1:47:39] they burn you, they stone you to death.
[1:47:49] Prison was mostly for for people that
[1:47:51] were captured from
[1:47:54] war. But the citizen, a city of refuge
[1:47:57] was set out. You better run as as fast
[1:48:00] as you can to get to
[1:48:02] one because when the adventure of blood
[1:48:05] gets you before you get to the city of
