somehow find the key for the ariel that would be fine very familiar song amen think about these words only a boy named david only a little slave only a boy named david but he could pray and sing only a boy named david only a rippling brook only a boy named david but oh five little stones he took and one little stone went in the sling and the sling went round and round and one little stone went in the sling and sing went round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round in the sling and home went up in the air and he giant came tumbling down i need to work do that again i didn't quite get that right would you let me try again only a boy named david only a little snake only a boy named david but he could pray and sing only a boy named david only a rippling brook only a boy named david but five little stones he tore and one little stone went in the slinging and round and one little stone went in the slick and the sling went round and round and

worshiping god not just singing but you where you feel strength going out your feet praise gorina you can feed the washing i remember years back that used to be uh maybe 1992 or around 92 late 9293 and the wall in our country took us from home and we were somewhere far in the in the in the interior there uh and i went to a pentecostal church church of pentecost and my goodness i felt like you know uh brother branham meeting that he went to among the pentecostal people man these people can worship i mean when it comes to worship they worship i mean they get on their knees they cry that they are singing but i mean you can feed it you can feed it they are putting it they are putting everything into it they are not just singing to hear themselves they are not singing says oh this person is missing the music or this person is you know missing the tone i mean they are they are pouring their heart out i think that's what worship is you must be able to feel it you must be able to feed it praise the lord if you lift your hands up it's like i'm going to get ahold of you lord you must be able to feed it [Music] if you're not feeling it you're not giving it if you give it you will feed it it's not the many songs we think it's not how loud those the the musicians are it's how much you put into it if you're not feeling it you're not giving it if you give it you will feed it praise the lord amen amen and i have a few prayer requests here praise the lord you know i felt uh i felt a little bit guilty and brother scared took that prayer request brother lloyd sent and we we took that on wednesday night but i mean for some reason i just couldn't read the words but scott ready without even wearing his glasses i said man that should be his father his father knows every letter he wrote whether he wrote back or front oh my goodness there was something that just come about but genetics amen just like his sheep hear his voice amen praise the lord sister beer acts that we pray for her this morning her brothers came down from iowa to see her for some family matters so she couldn't be in church but glenn is not feeling well he acts that we pray for him but one wanted us to want to had a praise report here wanted to be grateful his daughter sarah and her husband and their little daughter olivia is doing well he and his wife they are just spending some time with them catching up with some fellowshipping and trying to help them in some other way spoke with brother sister christian last night they are also doing pretty well and hope to be back in church soon praise the lord so we thank the lord for all of this amen uh ariel and sister grace your dad and ma'am wanted me to greet you people by bringing greetings to you from your parents then it's serious amen but the aerial parents also wanted us to greet the church amen among the many that we spoke with during the week they are saying their greetings brother jarrow from virginia also sent his greetings and but it is good to be in the house of the lord amen this morning we're going to talk uh on something that we long the waiter for musicians thank you you may have your seat and i promised i was going to speak on the treasure of the snow i want to speak on there this morning the treasure of the snow praise the lord so the lord bless you let's stand to our feet let's take our bibles in the book of job the treasure of the snow sometimes it's it's uh it's it's very varied uh i cannot say this morning in a way that god deals with uh sometimes something from the word of god catch your mind and you're trying to study that and and as much as the word of god is encouraging but it is really not coming together and sometimes god would just take a simple simple action of an individual or a simple word someone would say and it would just bring the picture together i think that that is one of this uh many of you preachers and and bible readers know what i'm talking about but it's one of this there's just something that just brought this whole thing together for me um i wish of course i will be talking about it different than i thought i would have spoken about it job chapter 38 job chapter 38 praise the lord job chapter 38 and again one of the reasons why the hair back i was waiting for the heavy snow day amen where you come to church in in and all your boots are filled with snow and you cover with snow then i think i thought that that would be a good time to preach this uh praise the lord praise the lord job chapter 38 let's read from verse 1. job chapter 38 let's read from verse 1. then the lord answered job out of the way wayne and said who is this that darkened counsel by words without wisdom now this this is coming very sobering to me so uh the language year means so much you you just have to grab it you mean who is this that that can counsel by words without wisdom get up that limbs like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou mean where will out when i laid the foundation of the earth declared if they all have understanding who have laid the measures thereof if they are know it or who have stretched the line upon it praise the lord but let's drop down to verse 22. god is dealing with with different things here but then he mentioned this have thou entered into the treasures of the snow all have thou seen the treasures of the hell praise the lord which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war when i read that part of the part of the scripture i could not help but think about one of david mann fighting in the snow the bible says he killed a lion in the snow so god reserve the snow for the days of battle how you think about a cold day for the days of battle but let's pray together heavenly father we will ask your blessings upon your word come lord jesus speak to us lord not with him or knowledge of god but lord father with the inspiration of the almighty may something be said lord father that will draw us closer to you we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed amen praise the lord hallelujah we thank the lord for the service last week i thought that that was a nice uh teaching presentation that brother lloyd did and uh and also the prayer meeting on wednesday night uh in in the week i got a message from a friend in uh south africa he sent me in the uh the air prayer chain and what the what they had is that they had a thirty minute section and uh from six a.m in the morning until i think six a.m the next morning and and family school could text him to fill in the 10-minute section that they want to take they want to take their teddy meetings to pray and uh and and i i just looking through it and i says oh yeah that's that's interesting and uh and then when i look and look i saw from 10 30 to 11 p.m from 11 p.m to 11 30 and then nobody feel in the game until early in the morning i say yeah yeah yeah he gave his beloved sleepy man praise the lord but uh yeah i think it's uh it's a beautiful time many many many of the same cell around the world most especially the brothers there in south africa uh most of their services are closed down because of the new string of ours that is coming from the outside of the word we we we want to keep them in our prayer constantly praise the lord uh and that's the reason why that i still believe that we will keep our prayer meeting uh going just like we started uh before the end of the year and those that are stay on on the prayer chain those times stay there you will definitely find somebody praying that you can join uh 6 a.m 9 00 am 12 at noon 3 pm 6 pm any of those time that you can be able to just set a time aside and pray that will be a blessing praise the lord amen that would be a blessing the truth about the motto that is that you have to remember whenever you get on your knees to pray there is always somebody around the world that is praying with you praise the lord so uh let's keep those prayer chain going in and we will continue our prayer meetings wednesday night and i believe that was a good faith message but then preach on wednesday night we we appreciate that praise the lord and i was thinking about i had on my heart that i was going to preach on the message the fear of being caught the fear of being caught but damn spoke a little bit about fear it didn't change my my subject uh actually but a little of what brother lloyd brought on sunday and uh you know uh getting you know not not aiming my coming shot of him in the mic you know uh as he was speaking the thought of that was going through my mind because i i've been studying on that i was i was actually listening to uh to a preacher the old friend of mine and he was saying something and he and he made reference on that and it and it caught my mind and i realized as i said to myself i said actually that's what many of us deal with i don't know whether you have been there but i have been there before the fear of being caught oh yeah and and uh uh like you you think think about it think about it this way i mean uh uh you don't want the rapture going and you are left here do you think about that sometimes do we scare you i don't want to be caught here it does not means that you are you are losing faith or you don't have faith praise the lord but uh uh i decided to look at some some few other things so we will trust the law to be able to bring that uh in some time now when looking at this subject about the treasure of the snow i thought that uh if uh the first time i i read this and i was looking at it my mind was just filled of uh scientific proof i needed to bring out things that we can benefit from from the snow so it kind of delayed me because i started making some search and making some search and and even though there were a lot of things that that i saw which of course i would share a few here with you um some very beautiful thoughts snow in nothing countries is is a special blessing of providence for by covering the earth it prevents combs and other vegetables from being destroyed by the intense cold of the air in the in the winter months and especially preserve them from co-piercing wing so as you cover the earth is keeping our food it's keeping the soil healthy for for another good season of planting all the seeds that are honored in it is not a fact that it possesses in itself and in fertilizing quality such as neutral soil are calling to uh many opinions its whole use is covering the vegetable from intense coal and thus preventing the natural heat of the earth from escaping so that the intense core cannot freeze the juice in the tenor tubes of vegetable which will rupture those tubes and so destroy the plant now so those are some of the few things i was i was gathering as i was looking at the benefit of snow but it just it just it was going to be a subject of too much information but what i was looking for i was looking for inspiration because there is a difference of having too much information that are not inspiring you can have too much information and there is no inspiration in it so uh so i will be going a little bit different from bringing you all of these information i mean you can make research on it and and another thing i was reading about you know how the snow fall the flakes fall and and many has been able to look at it and it has a six-pointed style you know uh i mean when you when you be able to look at it through a telescope or something like that and and the thing about it there is there to see how light they are when they are falling but when they come down and join together they become solid ice if you don't take time to walk you know where you find yourself praise the lord amen so i mean we can talk about that and talk about that but i want to go in a different direction this morning the reason why is that this conversation came up when god was responding to job and his friends amen now this was god asking job have you ever been to the treasure of the snow do you even know that the snow has a treasure praise the lord and i mean the creator of heaven and earth he have enough information he could have told job the snow can do this and the snow can do this and the snow can do this he could have just gone ahead and headed but you see the thing about it there is that god was not giving job information he made their statement to give job an inspiration are we together praise the lord so i hope i can be able to give you an inspiration this morning something about me said i might give you an inspiration that can open another word for you because that's what the holy ghost does praise the lord so if you go and search and and set it you'll get a lot of lot of wonderful things that are hidden in the treasure of the snow praise the lord so i just took that as a title this morning but uh my my inspiration and what i'll be dealing on this morning is talking more about treasure talking more about treasure so let's just let's just read i have heard but now i see amen i might not keep you alone and uh if i can be able to to to ending a good time here then brothers maybe we can just meet for a few minutes and cap what we wanted to share with you and uh it's just it's just more of an information something for us to be praying about that i wanted to to share with you so let's just read uh i mean this this might be our only uh quote that we'll be reading from maybe something else will come up now i have heard but now i see now we find out and take some of his life when god blessed him and made him a great man talking about job why even everybody respected him even told even to his wisdom even to his wisdom had become so great his inspiration from god has dedicated him to be god's seven so plainly until the people came from everywhere to hear him now think about that the people came from everywhere to hear him who else comes in your mind solomon solomon so keep that in your mind because we'll visit solomon as we talk about this but let me read another scripture here first corinthian chapter eight first corinthians chapter eight it's a it's a very uh uh familiar verse that we all read and uh uh but i will uh let's read from verse one first corinthians chapter 8 reading from verse 1 now as touching things offer unto idols we know that we all have knowledge praise the lord as touching things offer unto others we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffed up but charity edified if you look at the context of this something paul is bringing out here is dead we all have knowledge so based on our knowledge we can be judgmental we can misunderstand people amen then he goes ahead and says here if any man thinks that he knoweth anything if any man thinks think now that he really know but he thinks that he knows anything he knoweth nothing praise the lord yet as he ought to know praise the lord so you take this you take a verse one you bring it right into the setting of what we're about to talk about here job was expressing what he thought he knew your friends they were also expressing what they knew but all of their knowledge was far from the reality was far from the reality remember brother branham says all all that that we will ever know we just amount to a grain of sin we have to realize that praise the lord the four give us a canary brain that's what he said amen let me ask you a question who was the oldest man in the bible mentula do you know that menthusila died before his father am i preaching false doctrine is he a contradiction enoch was his father i just wanted to wake you up if any man thinks he knows if any man thinks he knows so let's go back here i've heard but now i see now we find out and we take some of his life that's job when god blessed him and god made him a great man you have to be careful with that whatever god bless you with whether it's a gift whether it's it's knowledge whether it's a talent whatever god bless you with you have to realize it's a gift from god you don't own it [Music] it's not your property why even everybody respected him even his wisdom has become so great his inspiration from god has vindicated him to be god seven so plainly until the people come from everywhere to hear him and then satan begin to accuse that man and that's the reason why you're having all the problems you are having let me let you know because satan is accusing you praise the lord and that's the way he does every inspired servant of god not every child but every inspired servant of god praise the lord that's the way he does every inspired servant of god this does that only means every preacher it means every child of god that has been caught by an inspiration amen every child of god has come to consciousness that god is dealing with their lives i mean they are not just going to church as a church member they are not just serving god in terms of religion but they realize that god is dealing with him satan is always there to accuse him of everything that he does that's not right now we find out his life and his trials and his great faith even jesus when he come on the earth he referred to the passion of job praise the lord but the joke knew he had patience no no job wanted to die why can't i just die and let this thing be open praise the lord because he was only in the moment he was in the moment of what was going on but beyond behind all of that expression behind all of that frustration there was something there was something that was holding him there was a patient that was holding him praise the lord now patience is a virtue as we always say passion does not means wait i was waiting on on on him for him to get there but he said i have so much patience you are missing two things praise the lord see his life has tried his thing jesus referred to the patient of job he says have you not read of the passion of job faith waits with patience for the promised world to be fulfilled can we say amen to death amen faith weight with patience so weight is not patient faith wait with patience for the promised world to be fulfilled patience is an unseen virtue praise the lord amen now we notice here that joke after after he went through his trial all his affliction he had a lovely family they were taken from him he had good health it was taken from him everything that he owns in this life was taken and he said on arrash hip with a piece of crook stripping his boards and even to his own wife spoke against himself why not curse girl and die praise the lord amen now you have to understand like like you know brother branham referred he says he never said job wife was foolish he said why are you speaking like a foolish woman amen now you have to think about it if if this woman after job trial you also have to put into perspective how long job trial was and honor a divine lord she could not go and get married and if she had children after job trial which means she was a young woman so her language of frustration there were there were a lot of things while she was expressing that because she's only free from her husband if he's dead she was not saying that in a sense of despising god she was not saying that because she did not believe but she was a woman she had feelings praise the lord that's why she was not a foolish woman but she was speaking like a foolish woman because if she was a foolish woman she would go and just be living foolishly and don't care that her husband is going through that praise the lord can we say amen praise the lord i don't normally ask for amen it's good when you have amen praise the lord he said the lord give it the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord now satan hype come up before god cause he could come before god and accuse the christian or the believer all the time so he accused job of many things and and and said that that job the reason he could serve god because everything was coming good for him if satan should accuse us we'll sit and be right if satan would take this accusation before god for you will he be right praise the lord well definitely for some people he will be right because let's try us you know strike them you don't see them anymore for many of the people in a prosperity gospel i mean he will be right they are singing with the band and they are dancing to the music because everything is going right we'll get into our our hesitation here but said if you just let me have him in my hands i would cause i will make him curse you to your face i want you to notice that the confidence that god had in a believer praise the lord the confidence that god have in a son or a daughter in other words god said to sit on like this you can do it he's a just man justifying he's a good man there is none not one like him in the whole earth or what a man that god himself will say to his enemy my seven is so perfect praise the lord and i believe that's what god will say to the devil concerning the bride that's what he will say concerning the bride because the bride is wrap up in the righteousness of jesus christ amen he will say that and he said that to the devil all the time satan you are a liar they never did it in the first place [Music] praise the lord now the thing about it there is that god is saying it on your behalf can you say amen to what god is saying can your life say amen to what god is saying he's speaking on your behalf praise the lord oh what a man that god himself who said to his enemy my seven is so perfect there is there is not another man on the earth like him think about that that was just joke one man think about the day that we are living in think about the things thinking about how the church has gone so low how we are allowing and the church has allowed all of the things that is happening the i mean the filthiness the immorality and god looking down on laodicean age and saying i have a people praise the lord i have a people are we together i have a people i believe the same way that god fed about job in his time the same way he felt about abraham when abraham was just alone amen the scripture said somewhere i just reading this kind of floating over my mind that abraham one man god gave him the land and he inherited and here we are many i think that was that was uh either in jeremiah there or ezekiel rebuking israel abraham one man god gave him the land and by promise he inherited and yeah we are many and we cannot possess it but i believe just as god spoke on behalf of job and talked about abraham i believe that's the way he looks at his bride amen i believe that's the way he looks at his dedicated sons and daughters we might be broken we might be trouble there might be a lot of questions in our mind like job had god did not change his testimony about job because of job questions god did not change his testimony because of job a frustration some of the things he said out of frustration god did not change his testimony praise the lord and that's that's why we want to look at that is the treasure that i want us to enter in this morning there is a treasure there there are there are a lot of things the thing about it there is that we have never known god before the fall why because we were all born in sinship like in iniquity come to the word speaking lies he deal with our heart so we are knowing god after the fall we have never known life before the fall that's the reason why you can put into context when paul said eyes have not seen ears have not heard neither have it come close to our heart what is in store praise the lord moses by vision when he wrote genesis 1 and 2 before the fall there was there was not a lot of things he said it took brother branham to come and give us a little picture of how adam named the animals and how adam said mountains i don't like you you move here and all of that that was just to give us an idea a little bit of how life was before the fall are we together praise the lord oh if we could only be that kind of a man that god could bestow that confidence upon us i know that we will not twist from his word all from his being no matter what people say about the message no matter what it says about brother branham they can go and bring his birth certificate and say his name was not mariam he make it up to maryam and and it is not the man it is not the man it's what god is doing in my life in your life [Music] [Applause] what what what is the benefit of a god that could use brother branham to that extent and he can't change my life what is the benefit of saving that god i don't want the measure of his gift i don't want to be another brother brandon i want to be blotted one but i want to experience god in a measure where god is real to me could god find a man or a woman that god could be stole such a confidence upon upon us that i know that we will not twist from his word amen and if you realize that was one of the outstanding attitude about job [Music] he had his integrity many scholars try they tried to bring this argument that's the reason why they established the thought that uh job scene that he had was fear because the thing he he was afraid of that's what he came on he says joe was just so much of himself and and that's that's that's that's not really that's that's the hemato but let's let's not go into an argument here let's stay with this because uh if we stay with this the law will bless us if we're going to anything else i'm not sure praise the lord i'm not sure to know that we will not twist from his word or his being anyway stay exactly and he can put his trust in us praise the lord that god can trust you that i know my son i know my daughter no matter what they are dealing with praise the lord amen and and it is the same word when we constantly goes back to the father now making excuses of our wrong praise the lord where we make excuses is where we have the fear of being caught praise the lord we make those excuses and and that is the reason why people make excuses because they are afraid that they will be caught amen oh yeah they are afraid that they will be caught are we together well may the lord help us now so we want to look in this now brother branham i took this from uh i've heard and now i've seen in broadband there was talking about the channel of inspiration i could read a lot of the calls to you but this is what i want to grab your mind let's go back to job 38. let's go back to job 38 let's go back to job 38 and we can just look at this together and uh and trust that the law will be able to to just bless our thought here i believe he has already blessed amen praise the lord amen i believe you have already blessed then the lord answered job out of a railway saying who is this who is this that dark in council by words without knowledge who is this that darkened council by words with our knowledge praise the lord there's uh that's there's just there's just a lot of thing there that we want to look at we pick up praise the lord and then he went up and and over a year he says where was that when i lay the foundation of the earth we rejoice in this praise the lord amen and i i remember myself preaching this before if god will ask me that question i know what to tell him because the prophet have already told us god could ask job that question but he can't ask me i would tell him where was that i will write in your mind praise the lord but let's let's look at it let's look at in the word of the lord let's look at it and see where was god bringing job to when god came on the scene where was he bringing now we have to remember brother branham says he's not an investigating angel he does not count down to condemn you he comes down to convict you he comes down to help you to have a little more of understanding than what you have because if any man thinks he knows he he knows nothing and he don't know as he ought to know so every time god comes down every time he comes and and open your understanding to deal with you sometimes it's not telling you two plus two is full but sometimes he's challenging you praise the lord amen he's challenging you takes your sleep away at 5 00 in the morning and see what you would do about it amen and you dash or under the blanket and you cover yourself and you close your eye tight but you can't sleep because he is the one that gives sleep praise the lord but when you re will you recognize and says lord i know you woke me up i know you are the one a guy will really enjoy my sleep just now we were there when i lay the foundation of the earth now as as you talk and in your real year god goes into different things i just talked i just took that their scripture on the treasure of the snow the treasure of the hill because i want to talk about treasure in a different way let's look at some few scriptures we will come back to our job year matthew chapter 6 verse 21. let's read matthew chapter 6 is is a familiar one where your treasure is there your heart will be is that what the scripture says amen if anyone have that down as a memory verse that you can go from this service and never forget it where your treasure is there your heart will be amen for where your treasure is there will your heart be also now you see the thing about it there is that when we think about treasure we think about what belongs to us what we are keeping what we hold so dear amen we don't want nobody to touch it the only thing in life i can be selfish about is my treasure that's my safe keeping that's that's the way we think about treasure let's read this other scripture also matthew 12 35. the scripture says a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bring her forth good things you need an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart praise the lord now that jeremiah make us to know the heart of man before he's converted is is desperately wicked amen now so when you look at this where my mind is going where i want to grab our attention here is that i want us to look at treasure not in what we have or we stole but look at treasure in the sense of the things you treasure the things you treasure praise the lord amen i will give you an example genesis chapter 47 let's go to genesis chapter 47 you will see the picture here this genesis chapter 47 was worth joseph gift his gift brought egypt to this space amen his gift brought egypt to this place look at verse 13 the bible says and there was no bread in all the land for the farming was very sold saw the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reasons of the farming and joseph gather up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canada for the con which they bought and joseph brought the money to pharaoh's house and and and when money fell in the land of egypt and in the land of canada all the egyptians came to joseph and and said give us bread for why should we die in that presence for the money failure we don't have money so why should we die jesus said okay god gave me your cattles they gave him his cattles when they were hungry again they came back to joseph and he says give us food why should we die because of cattle we don't have cattle okay give me your houses they give their houses when the money when when they are fulfilling they came back again and and they said why should we just say give me your lane and at the end of the story the bible says here that uh 26 verse 26 the scripture says and joseph made a lord over the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of of the priests on it which uh became nat's pharaoh but what happened here is that uh now pharaoh owned he owned the lane he owned the money he owned the katos he owned the houses and you also own the people praise the lord remember pharaoh is king what brought them to that place it was joseph wisdom and that is the very same place that christ's wisdom has brought us that everything we own our money in our house our life all belongs to him why did the people constantly came to joseph because his wisdom was a treasure his wisdom was a treasure when pharaoh couldn't even understand his own dream and joseph came and and reminded pharaoh of his dream and give him the interpretation that was the reason why pharaoh set him over everything because such a wisdom is a treasure so now egypt had a treasure why because they had a man in their mess that could speak just say okay you don't have money bring your katos okay come on let's go joseph said it it was they couldn't struggle over it why you and uh a hebrew trying to tell us to bring our cattles they knew that they wouldn't have been talking about seed or plain if joseph did not advise pharaoh did not interpret pharaoh's dream so the gift was a treasure the people was treasury in the gift praise the lord they were treasury in the gift and i believe by inspiration that's where god was bringing job amen where was you when i laid the foundation of the earth only little you know job there is a treasure treasure in me treasure ignoring me treasure ignoring that i have everything under control your treasure should not be what you have because what you have is limited what you know is limited some people treasure so much in their knowledge when they don't know nothing they put just few codes together and few structures that they just think that all the treasure in the world they know the word i was just thinking about that yesterday as i was driving i'm taking some reflex in my mind and i was saying my goodness have you ever preached at a place where you know you are preaching and you are saying lord jesus have mercy lord jesus because you can feed it you can feed it you can feel the resentment you can feed the rejection you can feed the evil forces that are gathering praise lord we do preach in a meeting where you are withstood by an evil spirit i remember one meeting there over in in togo and uh preaching along south broad delhi and larger feminine and [Music] baker was the guest preacher so he had to go and preach at bert patrick's church in the evening so i had to take the evening service and uh and and that church is a solid church but you're going to church there in together it's a solid church but i mean to to preach and the holy spirit comes right behind the service with tongs interpretation picking up your message picking up things you had in your message those things are not only things that brother branham said those things are things that are happening among people the people are anxious to see it they are praying to see it they are living up to see it they come to church on time they wait on the lord they pray because they want to see god moving in their mess and yet some of the things that we have experienced and seen we counted nothing because they are men that has been there but egypt treasured the treasure they gave that joseph had in so much that everything they have they gave it to him everything they had their lane their their houses and and if you just read down i'm trying to find that scripture but the scripture shows here uh you know uh that the only place that pharaoh did neha was the land that belonged to the priests but pharaoh owned all of egypt and he owned the people that's what happened when we treasure in the one that we believe when we treasure in the one that we worship we don't hold back anything we don't hold back anything because you know my life belongs to god my money belongs to god my house belongs to god my family belongs to god there is a difference in having a treasure and what you treasure in praise the lord a good man out of the treasure of his heart that scripture sounds as what he's having in his heart no what it means a good man out of what his heart treasure after bring for good fruit it's what your heart is treasuring after because your heart is treasury after god i mean you you want to be a seven because you have to understand that there is proud that is in this nature i would just i would just reading that uh uh uh this morning i don't have it there that's a quote so don't bother and i can read it here to you uh i was looking into something this morning too that was so beautiful my goodness i just couldn't even grab sleep this morning i was just looking into a subject that was just so beautiful but let me share this with you brother brandon says yeah uh he says here he's talking about that that uh that's question in answer 1964 august 30th he says as long as you are in this life you are going to be sticky and have a kind of nature that's going to bother you as long as you live as long as you are in this life we don't preach sinless perfection our perfection is in christ you're going to have a sticky nature the era in your life you're going to be selfish there's a little blade of pride that will be sticking out you got to get the wheat and whip it off gotta wash this area stick it and have a kind of nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but inside of you you are born again inside of you you are born again your heart is treasuring to be like jesus your heart is treasuring to overcome these things but they are sticking on your flesh praise the lord are we together so there is a difference there is a difference of the treasure that we have to ourself everything that we have as treasure is in him our treasure is in him amen praise the lord we treasured in him and that's where god was trying to bring job do you know the treasure of the snow not to give him all the scientific proof but to let him to know there is a treasure that's a wisdom beyond what all you know there's a wisdom and to know that there is wisdom above our wisdom it makes us to treasure in the one that we believe it our treasure is in him not in ourselves not in a certain pastor or minister our treasure is in christ that's the one our heart long where your treasure is there your heart will be your heart long for more of him for more of him think about it where your treasure is there your heart will be amen praise the lord he said oh my treasure is in heaven heaven is consists of the word that's what the prophet said heaven is consists of the word so where your treasure is my treasure is in this word my treasure is in the wisdom that comes from this word the advice that comes from this word the counsel that comes from this word the rebuke that comes from this world my treasure is in it that's the reason why we take the council of the word gladly to our heart [Music] if it is said the word says so no question if that is where your heart is where your treasure is if they point your heart to your treasure you will say amen you want to argue with the word how can you have a treasure that brings you to your treasure door and say this thing is in your treasure he said what really no no no no no no no no no it's in your treasure this is your treasure [Music] oh no it's not no i i never expected this to be there this is not what i want in my treasure it is your treasure all we think about is what we have what we have praise the lord and there is nothing good in us there is nothing good in us god is not treasuring anything in this body then just changing this body giving you a constant desire to treasure for the life to come treasure for the rapture treasure for the changing of the body treasure for the holy ghost [Applause] god asks job where was that when i lay the foundation praise the lord glory be to god whoa are we together am i still on time i have a few minutes here amen amen we mentioned solomon that was the same when the gift when the gift was manifested and the people saw that this man knows the secret of the heart what did they the treasure in that gift amen the treasure in that gift the queen of the south she heard about the treasure she got a gift to go and put in your treasure [Laughter] oh my praise the lord just forget about me i'm just in another place amen she heard about the treasure she got a gift to go and sow in that treasure the treasure in the game of solomon until all through his reign there was not one warfart that was how much the treasure in his wisdom praise the lord amen and this is the very solomon that teaches us the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom you know what he means the fear of the lord when you start referencing god you are entering into his treasure when you start referencing god you are entering into his treasure that's the time he will start to show you things that you never knew things that are too wonderful for your eyes to see oh man i'm feeling so good so good praise the lord it's not this kind of for emotional messages but i'm just feeling so good i'm feeling so good proverbs 8 and chapter 9 solomon talks about wisdom but yet he put wisdom he said for thou well with me when i created the word he said wisdom buildeth of house he put wisdom in a in a feminine gender oh my goodness you know brother branham says uh sit on eden he says that uh uh uh this bride will tell that make the devil know that what he did to eve he can do it to us he can do it to us why because the bride is the wisdom part of god she's a wisdom part of god [Applause] amen you know why she's a wisdom part she's not smart but god hear his secret in your life he hears the secret of redemption in her life [Applause] my goodness i just i feel like running i'm just feeling so happy praise the lord thank you jesus glory be to god genesis chapter three adam is standing right there the serpent is standing right there eve is dead in the middle and he said the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent head you know the the seven lucifer falling sun of the morning his hair started to spin woman having a seed he wanted to suggest to god you made me say you're supposed to say the man you made a mistake you're supposed to say the man not the woman because the woman does not have a seat how are you challenging me with a woman bringing a seat how we the together christ is the mystery of god revealed brother branham says the things that those prophets life the mystery that was hidden in their life he said if david only knew that when he went on the mountain and started to weep because he was rejected if he only knew that he was playing out christ if he only knew that he had no knowledge about that he was just he was just sitting there and saying oh my god oh what i've had done lord you have blessed me you've been so good to me how did i got myself in this whole bathsheba i think oh my goodness you're saying i'm rejected by my own people praise the lord if he only knew that he was playing out christ are we together look at paul here he says corinthians 8 that we just read we know the idols are abomination he says but let's think about this because knowledge quits to puff up knowledge quick to judge but think about this from the very act that drove david from the throne that from the very eye that drove him from the throne will become a son now you yeah you and myself josh that matter that's what solomon was never israel favorite he was not israel february until he rise to the throne israel favorite what's who absalom the god with the afro the bible said he was a huge man he was a hamson guy that was israel favorite why because they were georgian solomon by his birth their knowledge puff up until they was rejecting this man the treasure that is in wisdom the treasure that is in wisdom and like i said all the time wisdom is just the right use of knowledge it's just the right use of knowledge you can have all the knowledge of the word if you don't use it rightly then you have a wisdom that is not from above because james brought us to that place of wisdom from above and wisdom from beneath the wisdom from beneath have got us into all of this that we aim that's the treasure that's what god talked he all he also asks he also asks her a job what do you think about the astra when she lay her eggs she buried them in the earth she don't even know where she buried him praise the lord you will think in your human mind that it's a careless animal she don't even know where she bury her young's praise the lord but you think about it she digs the earth put her eggs there and cover it to make it warm to create a temperature praise the lord he says you might think that the astra is dumb once you do that but i will also tell you that even a hearse cannot run onto an oscar that's why he told you all the treasure there is treasure in everything that god created there is just abundance of treasure that is hidden behind it abundance of wisdom that is hidden behind the hair on our head why he gave it to us praise the lord just just summing the hair on your body there is just a lot of wisdom that he puts into death that even signs in all their research will never come close they will never come close so that's what he's bringing job now now watch here he did not he did not condemn job no he didn't condemn job he only told job there all you are saying is right but there is another part that you don't know about now the people he condemned were the friends of job because they were not speaking on god's behalf because they thought that they knew they thought that they knew why job was suffering because you are a secret sinner because you are hiding things in your life you've been wicked you've been selfish they're in their mind they're all ordered you so god said you never spoke for on my behalf you better go let joe pray for you praise the lord you are not speaking on my behalf when you come condemning god's people when you come trying to make god's people to go back to walk off of the blood that has redeemed him you're not speaking on god's behalf because the work of god he didn't put it in the hands of any man he has power enough to transform the life of his people he might keep them in a moment he might be building characters in their life there are things that might be going on that you don't have no idea about that you don't have no idea about don't use your canary brain on god predestinate a seed don't use your selfish judgment and you know what it does to us when we realize that beyond all our mistakes and our failures our shortcomings there's a great wisdom that we don't understand and make us to fall to our knees and cry and cry they don't make you proud and you start to argue and defend yourself you are just as foolish as your sin is foolish when you start to defend yourself in your wrong to realize that god in his mercy when you are afraid to be caught by men you cannot run from the eyes of god because his eyes run the torah for through the earth [Music] you cannot be more swifter than the eyes of god he knows your thoughts he knows the intents of your heart but yet in all of that he looks beyonce your fault and he extend mercy to you you look beyond your rebellious heart and stay esteemed mercy to you and then you think you are justified in your ways just thinking about that must bring us to our knees and cry and say lord who am i that you are bestowed such a love upon what's the wisdom that is hidden behind my life that you just can't let me go that's what god was bringing job where were you when i lay the foundation of the earth but god identified somebody that was with him who was that wisdom he said for she was with me she was with me when i formed the heaven and the earth glory be to god glory be to god this age where we can pull everything on on google we can ask google for questions praise the lord google don't have the wisdom of god that's the greatest gift first corinthians chapter one let me close here it's one o'clock amen first corinthians chapter one first corinthians chapter one let's read verse teddy you think about that think about that people think about that wisdom is the feminine part of god and we know the feminine path is a weaker vessel that's what is despised it looks so common praise the lord that's why it looks like foolishness to this word because it's the feminine part of god but yet it has strength amen it has strength it gives life it's wisdom that bears life it's the woman that bears life the man in all of his muscles he does not have an idea of what nine months period take he don't have an idea of it he don't have an idea you are not built that way it's wisdom that conceives seed for god it has it it's wisdom that dead all the trials and go through the different stages if a man thinketh that he knows first corinthians 1 verse 30 [Music] praise the lord amen but of him i hear in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom but of him i ye in christ jesus will of god the very breath of christ was the wisdom of god because when he said a virgin shall conceive that tribes could not understand it everybody had their interpretation when he said the virgin shall conceive it went 700 years he never gave a time he never put did to it that's why i said don't put god on your calendar because god is out of time he's the one that determined times you don't put god on your calendar that's been rude god you must do this for me and god and this this by this time by this time before i get to this time in my life i've just been arrogant i've just been arrogant because maybe it is the time that god is just starting with you at a time where you think you're ready i'm ready now to move on my own god said this won't just want to kill himself have a message i gotta do something to hold this boy don't put god on your time calendar because god is out of time he's out of time but it's time in my life i want to be here but it's time in my life i want to be here jim says try and say by the grace of god he said try and say god by your grace because there is just a lot of wisdom the field of the lord is the key it's the key to go into the treasure of wisdom i just feel like preaching this now that i've started when i don't have time it's now that the inspiration has broke open oh my goodness me is that my wife saying that praise the lord amen christ christ woe of god is made wisdom for us it's made wisdom that's the reason why he is our treasure he's the one where my treasure is that way my heart was sick my treasure is in him because he was made wisdom for us my treasure is in him just like the gift of joseph brought the entire land of egypt that's how christ brought us to give him our house give me i gave you my house i give you my everything because you are a safe treasure and when the people did there read the story when the people did there they could come to joseph at any time of the year for corn he would give them corn to go and planet because everything they have belonged back to the storehouse everything they had belonged back to the treasure and that's what god was telling job you want to see the snow job but do you know the treasure of the snow do you know the wisdom why i allow snow to fall do you know that the mind that is behind that you are just looking at pressing live and what your eyes can see what your body can feel what your ear can hear you are not wrong job but there is more and that's where he came up with this statement when job replied to god the bible says he said this let's read that and then we close praise the lord praise the lord i hate to close when it's getting so good but let's just read it and we were close amen job chapter 42 then job answered the lord and said i know that thou can do everything and that no thoughts can be withholding from thee no touch you know all i was thinking when god came down and just and just challenged job you are talking with darkness wisdom no counsel your speech are dark you have just a little bit of light is what you see he says i know no touch is here from thee and i can tell you this morning he knows every thought that is running through your mind now he knows what you're thinking on don't change your talk don't change your mind trying to adjust your thought and be spiritual no no no no keep your mind to where he is he just caught you you know i can't play spiritual and no thought can be withholding from thee who is he that have counsel without knowledge wherefore have i altered that i understood not i alter what are honors to not that's what when situation is going on tie your tongue hold it within don't look for words seek god's mercy because if you don't do that you will start altering words that you will have to come back and repent which of course that's the thing that is difficult because we will come back with defensive you know i'm sorry but you know i'm very sorry but you know you know nothing really touched me can you can still see the the angle there i don't want to get into it let me just stay with this wherefore i've altered that i honestly not things too wonderful for me wish i knew not the very thing that he was crying about the balls on his king now he starts to see them being too wonderful oh my goodness being too wonderful because god is showing there's a treasure that's this wisdom that is hidden behind the breaking up of your skin it tastes so wonderful for me oh my god oh my god yeah i'll be seshti and i will speak i will determine of thee and declare thou unto me i have heard of thee by the yearing of the year see but now i see you now i see you because i can see past my situation now i see you i have heard of you the

partner and i realize it [Music] not appreciating the grace that is keeping you [Music] it shows it shows some sense of fear [Music] that if god don't give me the life pattern that i'm going to fail that should not push you in making the wrong decision because if god don't help you you make the wrong choice and you will live with it for the rest of your life knowing that there is a treasure of wisdom that we may never know so i want what you want for me dear jesus whatever [Music] i know that you know about my lord [Music] what you want you know many years many years back when i first heard
