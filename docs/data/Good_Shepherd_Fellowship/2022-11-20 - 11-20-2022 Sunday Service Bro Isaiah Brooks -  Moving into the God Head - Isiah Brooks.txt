Colossians 2. appreciate the musicians and most of all I appreciate the Holy Spirit God is good as I was saying last night I don't have to feel him to know he's walking with me but I still like to feel him touch me every now and again amen we appreciate the Lord Jesus and try to pick up for where we left off last night I wanted to bring something different but that's not what the will of the Lord is so we'll go with what he wants for certain Hallelujah he just directed us in a somewhat a different way but I pray that the word of God will find a place of rest in your heart Colossians 2 we're going to start reading at the ninth verse for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily that means the entire fullness of God's nature dwelt in that body amen and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principalities in power in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism wherein ye also are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who have raised him from the dead now we're not talking about water baptism here we talk about spiritual and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh have he quickened together with him excuse me have he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses you know that I I I look at like the edit like this if you're going to read the word you need to believe the word through you don't need to figure it out you take it for what it says and God will work it through you let us pray father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for the sweet spirit that I feel in this place oh God I pray that you bless this church abundantly Lord continue to give them Grace continue to Lord help them grow oh God we thank you for all things let your perfect will be done in this place this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we know that we are may we can't make it without Grace right we're speaking on last night about moving into the godhead taking our position on the throne and of course we realize by God's grace that uh something has to change because we have used Grace as an excuse for disgrace I'm gonna say it again because we constantly say Grace Grace Grace and oftentimes we live like liberals that's true uh because we know God is the forgiving God but our Prophet has also told us that there is a line you can cross and we know that throughout the church ages Grace was so given because they didn't know neither did they understand the perfect will of God they didn't have a prophet they didn't have a vision amen especially in our time so they didn't know what God's will was and the Bible uh said that you know without a vision the people perish and we know by God's grace amen that the vision in which God gave us was not to return back to Egypt it wasn't even to continue to wander in the wilderness it wasn't even to just cross into the Promised Land but it came it was to obtain yes the promise you know it was like Joshua and Caleb give me my mountains I want my inheritance and that's what the message of this day has come to do is to bring us into our inheritance Hallelujah not by uh uh Power not by Mike but by my spirit saith the Lord everything we do has to be done by the holy spirit is that right Jesus even said I'll do nothing except I see my father do it first and when I see him do it that's when I will do it God deals with us in so many different ways but we must not get our lines crossed yeah yeah in this day and time we've come to do something that no other generation has ever done and that is to defeat death yes yes Jesus defeated death and when he defeated death we defeated death every victory that Jesus Christ gained yes sir everyone he won we were with him as I said yesterday and this has to be more than something that we love to hear it must move from the head yeah Into the Heart Hallelujah you see entering into heaven without the Deni without the divine nature of God is not even possible I'm gonna say it again entering into heaven that's right without the divine nature of God is not even possible because the Bible says no unclean thing hello somebody no Liars no thieves no gamblers no harm on this none of that filth will enter somebody help me it is we're dealing with uh absolute phenomenon how can this be done can a leper change his spots absolutely not it's not something we can do but God can this is why we need him the nature of the divine nature of God we've seen that in people you know add to your faith virtual knowledge y'all know how it reads and the Bible said that in all of these virtues amen dwells in within you you would never be Barren neither will you fall hello when I hear that I hear Perfection yes I hear something that is to me is impossible for me to do how many of y'all know what I'm talking about for those of us a man who's experienced law what it is to be under the law in the message um so y'all get quiet on that one Hallelujah Hallelujah also they bound us with Spirits yeah yeah and these Spirits amen were lost laws that they themselves couldn't even keep Hallelujah if the Pharisees couldn't keep their logs well then the Pharisees of our day can't keep theirs either right is that right because the Bible tells us that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and when John looked for someone to open to take the book and to loose the seals amen he said he could find no one so no matter how righteous you think you are no matter how holy you think you are you're not worthy within yourself you're not worthy there's only one that was found worthy Hallelujah and that one is Jesus Christ Hallelujah he took the book he lost the seals Hallelujah and what was the seals the revealing of Jesus Christ in a nutshell Hallelujah you love the Lord you and I must understand that the thing that God released was his life Adam and Evil call it the toilet but it was literally the life of God that was taken away from him because had the life of God remain he would have never died so God had to take Hallelujah is that right that's why Paul said if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I've got a building you see for years we thought we had this building that constructed like man we didn't understand I got a body I've got a body with y'all know what that means that means no more suffering no more pain no more heartache no more stress Hallelujah and no more getting old yes I look in the mirror I'm like boy you ain't the same maybe inside but not outside Hallelujah but we all grow old and y'all love it no nobody in here likes to grow old right brother Hallelujah but it is what we have to do because it's the curse that in itself ought to make those who don't believe believe right let's move on now you and I must understand this message is so great far beyond what I say the way Pentecostals believe because how many of y'all remember you know when you went to church those of us who went to the Pentecostal Apostolic Church um we we went there for the music oh we didn't want to admit that but no matter how good the preacher preached if we didn't get that don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't y'all remember that oh we you had to come out with a shout now and if you didn't have a good shout or dance and if the anointing wasn't high enough for you to speak in tongues you thought man they should have got a better preacher we blame it all on the preacher but you see that's the way people our mindsets are now and they fail to see that the Holy Spirit Reveals His secrets in simplicity you get what I'm saying because remember when they Israel when Israel when they just had the Manna they never understood it anyway when they had the Manna flowing they weren't satisfied and they wanted meat and what did the meat do it made them sick why because it wasn't meat in due season is that right that's what made brother Branham different from all the pre he had all kinds of stuff locked up in his spirit things Revelations and understandings of the word but he couldn't preach it until the season presented itself this is what has happened Amen in the message it wasn't time for certain things to be spoken and the people were still children it's like taking you know a baby and feed them meat now I I know what you said well eagles eat meat that's what people say but the point is how many of them at that point or that Junction we're real eagles that's right that's right see we all have potential to be Eagles but until a birth comes yes until a change comes you can't eat it like you you know you know if you if you're alive as an eagle you can eat it like an eagle somebody help me because what we did and I'm gonna go back with it like I said yesterday we have married a system many of us we know the quotes we know how to dress come on somebody we all sang the same songs that in itself wrong you don't have to sing this song because they sang it you sing the songs that bless your church oh come on somebody let's show right but we all come and we just you know I can't hardly stand it I can't hardly stand it you know when when I know that when the Holy Ghost comes it takes you out of your order and puts you into his order but what we have done systematically we have done just like all the others we tried to control the Holy Spirit somebody help me it's true and we took conduct in order and killed the people we forgot brother Brandon said you ought to least get out of order to get the Holy Ghost and understand this you're not going to get a birth in here being lukewarm there's a certain temperature [Music] Church Must produce in order to bake for somebody to receive a bear come up in here with the Catholic spirit the Baptist spirit the Pentecostal spirit Hallelujah that ain't what you want you got to go higher y'all understand what I'm saying all of those things were good but the charge of the Living God should never be called Dead somebody help me here you say oh the messenger messenger and gone ever since 65. y'all understand what I'm saying how far have we moved how if we haven't moved something's wrong almost right y'all better hear what I'm saying how far how far have we moved and the reason me is because we still got people amen holding on to the Past most of all we've got people who will not forgive Hallelujah and if you don't forgive God can't forgive you [Music] all better hear what I'm saying because the Bible said no matter how you pray no matter how much you want to fast no matter how much you shout no matter how much you dance in the spirit if you've got an art against your brother you got the fiction somebody help me here that needs to make it right [Music] see I'm a preacher I can say that but let me break it down to you it comes down to an individual affair let everybody do what they got to do but you keep yourself right give me somebody I'm talking about coming into the godhead y'all understand me you ever thought about why the book was called the Lamb's Book of Life because only Lambs were in the book amen no goats in there it didn't say the farm Book of Life with all kind of animals no it was lamb all right and those are the only ones that goes in Lambs y'all oh Lamb of God y'all know we sing that song keep on working on me until I become the Lamb of a lamb of God do you understand what you're singing that means you are presenting yourself for the slaughter you're right huh yes sir listen we're beating gold I said this yesterday the invitation was it come and be gold like gold tried in the fire yeah and nobody wants to fire but the fire is the thing that God of your life y'all hear what I'm saying I know by the grace of God you need to understand there's no way that you're gonna be the bride and not suffer amen you gonna go through it but at the same time God is building character in you Hallelujah remember I said yesterday your attitude toward what God does in your life determines where you are whether you're still a baby or whether you're maturing right as a baby when your parents spank you you think they're being mean and it's not fair you hear that all the time that that's not fair and they don't understand as parents you're their judgment and his judgment his judgment God's judgment is true everything that goes on in your life has already been considered can I say it like that has already been been uh in God's mind he knows exactly the outcome and it's always for your betterment I said trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own what understanding acknowledge Him in all your ways and he shall direct your path man yes Lord how can you ever say that the judgments of God is not true when he's the one who's kept you safe but he's the one who has that who's protected you in times of trouble he said what hide me and we don't we fail to see amen that the almighty God is working on a beautiful plan and you're part of it that's what I'm excited about Hallelujah I don't care amen where he's got me in the picture as long as I'm in the picture [Music] Hallelujah each and every part is important that's why God put you together you understand me you could be in another church somewhere but God brought you here [Music] and people say well you know people at the church they ain't this named that well the truth of the matter is you ate this and you ain't that right either God brought all this imperfection together to produce perfection but she get on my nerve that's why she was ordained to get on your nerve and guess what you got to love her Hallelujah is that right you don't have to love a person's ways but you must love them let me let me read a quote here I didn't do much reading yesterday but let me read this it's okay yes I'm gonna read it anyway oh did Steve that the revelation of this message is not always what we think laying on our hands and seeing the dead rays and eyes of the blind open even though those things happen we got to have a balance to all of this yeah right he said he never listen talking about Stephen now he never performed any miracles although he knew that Christ was a miracle performer you know I've heard people say well I ain't never seen a supernatural and I'm thinking you're something wrong something's really wrong because you're the supernatural when God saved you that was Supernatural [Music] where were you looking when you were in the mirror hallelujah how can you forget what you used to be and what you are now [Music] that was God who changed you that right he said and he knowed that Christ was a miracle performer he knowed all of his powers and things but what did he do he just this is this is the this is it he just presented his life in such a way that they seen that he was the power of Christ you understand me he it would seem like I tried to tell people the other day when God come looking for the token he ain't going to look in your heart he never went into rahab's house the token had to be displayed on the outside where everybody could see it that's right that's right wow y'all hear what I'm saying the token The Life of Christ has been praised in your heart but what good if it's just in your heart and it never manifests yourself on the outside the token Christ has been given to us for other people to see shed someone to heal Hallelujah you've got to be seen oh I don't want to be saying no we don't want to be seen but we want Christ to be seen Hallelujah that's demon right right amen you may never see a vision you may never put your hands on a sick person and feel the charge of the almighty God make a skeleton of a man turn back to life again that's the way it was in the Pentecostal realm we thought everybody with the Holy Ghost had lay hands on the sick raise the dead and oh you know what I'm saying now only God is speaking in tongues and shouting let me ask you a question but what do we have that's manifesting itself y'all hear what I'm saying oh I ain't talking about oh wow God's in the prophet I don't know no I'm talking about life The Life of Christ must be seen Hallelujah even if God never calls you to lay hands on the person you should know within yourself the ability everything that is necessary to do it is in me [Music] amen amen is that the truth yeah I think about Jesus he could have killed he could have healed everybody but God Led Led him to the pool of shalom that's right Hallelujah that man like the prophet God wasn't the only man that needed healing and he was not the worst sick person there but God chose him yeah you see what I'm saying he was so in tune with the Holy Spirit take the leadership of God was just a nod foreign somebody help me here comes by way of consecration oh come on somebody you say your body and you won't even consecrate yourself right help us Jesus well the brother said I could rebuke right you know I'm doing everything amen I've been into this message since 19 see 75 or 70s no 83 I think it was 83. I've seen God like raise the dead twice Open the Eyes of the blind heal all men of diseases one guy amen was or whatever he was he lived in uh Zimbabwean God had his father and here now I'm not preaching me I'm saying Jesus and everybody who's lived in this message y'all remember how it used to be Miracles wasn't a problem it happened all the time healings and deliverances were all the time well then what has happened yes sir the word hasn't changed right people have even as the as the the early church Ephesus you know what happened to them they lost their first love we used to love the anointing we loved it in the church we loved it at school we loved it on the job we loved it every wherever we were not ashamed amen oh y'all getting quiet but I'm trying to bring you to a place where you can see amen that what worked yesterday won't work today and this is cleaning up time this is time where God says make yourself ready and right now the devil got us all so busy right so preoccupied with everything and we're forgetting the most important thing and that is our souls oh you look at look at the people the the wealth is falling apart and everybody still want to be rich foreign what good if you gain the whole world and lose your soul can you imagine praise the Lord and the worst tormented people in hell is those who have heard this message and turned it down right because let me tell you something about death it will always bring you truth you can lie to yourself all you want in this dimension but when death comes death brings truth do you hear what I'm saying it brings you truth that's one time the devil is going to tell you the truth but if you do your bad side you'll believe him but oh if you've had an experience and you know where you're standing Hallelujah and you know that your ain't gonna hold and grips a solid rock not even death that's what Paul said who shall separate me from the love of God [Music] Hallelujah I'm trying to preach I'm trying to get to my message here he said you'll never see you may never see a vision you may never put your hands on a sick person and feel the charge of almighty God make a skeleton of a man turn back to life again you may never see him standing Yonder in three uh or four rainbows you may never see his image you may never hear his voice but still you can be a signpost that will reflect Jesus Christ by a life that's been so pure and unadulterated upon the world from the world not smothered up with dirty things around your life but a pure unclear words that it'll cause the Hungry Heart to hunger and thirst to be like you I know that's real I had a young man as a friend still and he and you know I didn't know I was just living life and he said I just want to learn how to love God the way I see you love God to tell him I love God but he saw my life and that's what people need to see you know if Christians know that you if the sinner know that you're a real Christian they would take up for you people want to see somebody genuine something real and they will take up for you even when they themselves are not Christians Hallelujah and they know who to come to when when they need prayer that's how real it must be Hallelujah glory to God he loved the Lord amen listen listen brother Adam talked about uh the vision or the the visitation when he was on the high Ohio River and you know it's it's so amazing because am I coming through this message people had a way of interpreting things the way they wanted it to interpret it and so what they did is it's that they changed the gospel don't get mad with me now they changed the gospel from Jesus Christ to God sent a prophet y'all better hear what I'm saying and when they did that they lost the power of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost only comes in the name of Jesus Christ somebody help me here they're still people and perhaps there was a time a man thought that but listen the message is moving it's moving on can I say it like this amen it's like you're being trained and if any of you have ever been in the military you know what I'm talking about and when you're in the military it ain't your way that's right it's the Sergeant's way and you better shut up and say nothing whatever he tells you to do you better do it because if you fail to do what you commanded to do guess what your whole platoon is going to have to suffer for you that's right and you don't want that to happen because they get mad with you you understand what I'm saying let me say it like this in in plain English when you don't do what God wants you to do your church suffer for it it's such a spiritual way that I don't think people realize how many times you thought about calling somebody and they called you the moment you was thinking about it huh why are you in a spiritual Realm somebody God said pray for you don't even know what that what's going on and all of a sudden you start praying for them then you call and they say well you know I needed something at that time and y'all know what I'm saying it is this is a spiritual thing but let me tell you like this if the ether wave if that if we we could create a crystal that could literally take the other dimension of the fourth dimension and and Fifth and whatever and bring it into this Dimension man's creation was able to do that tap into those other dimensions and bring them visible that's what William Branham was made out of and that's what you're made out of but if you don't put the crystal in the proper place you won't get it to work that's right you understand what I mean you are that connection to heaven and if you get in your proper place God will then send things through you that others may see that he is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not now I don't know maybe I'm wrong but the Bible said in the presence of the Lord there is fullness of joy Hallelujah and at his right hand there's Pleasures forever more and I go to church and I said but where is the joy yeah yeah where is the joy people to come to church they ain't happy they systematically come y'all don't understand I I was raised up in a church uh City that had a Catholic big Catholic Church six o'clock AM the past the the the the apocalypse is full and I I just every time I would see that I would rebuked I said you know this is a rebuke to the truth oh come on yeah I understand what I mean traditionally they they they there they believe if they come to the six o'clock mass I know I used to go to six o'clock mass six o'clock that early in the morning yeah Hallelujah you understand me we can't even get people to church on time at seven o'clock in the evening but those people will be there six o'clock in the morning just for a little space of time to get up on the or offer their knees back on their knees uh you know yeah and I always tell people they got more movement in their Church than message churches some people come into church and they sit down don't move until the church is over it's the truth let me go home but people I'm I'm trying to bring us into a place of life how many of y'all believe that brother Brandon said that the man in the message is won now he ain't talking about the flesh y'all believe that so let me ask you a question do you believe you're the message if I read your life what will I read hello come on somebody because a message had been given to you and and the angel said John eat the book eat it for thou must prophesy again yes sir we don't want to be found naked do we we want to be clothed upon this is a serious message this is serious you know I'm scared I'm afraid for most people I'm not saying I'm where I'm supposed to be but at least I know which which direction I'm headed and I look at people and I think where is the joy y'all remember some of us are old enough to remember people used to rush to church be on time but when it becomes a system where brother Brandon said I got to be here at a certain time you ain't got it you're not under a system but I'm rushing to get the charge because I know I'm going to meet him there God will meet me there [Applause] that's right and guess what Jesus keeps all of his appointments he's gonna meet me there that's why I want to be there how many of y'all know what I'm talking about when you establish a prayer life at a certain time in a day guess what sometimes you get there and he's already in your corner somebody know what I'm talking about the anointing is already there and you just kneel down weep and have a good time in God because you know Jesus beats you there I had a figment of our imagination it's real and the dimensions we're talking about is red down and when you're born of the sixth Dimension when God comes into you you pull from that Dimension that's what the place is in Christ Jesus not tomorrow now Hallelujah I haven't had joy in a long time it ain't God's fault Hallelujah one thing I love about my grandkids when they want something they don't mind asking and sometimes they have to huddle up team up and get a leader to come and ask me because they know if I say yeah that means all of them gonna get it right I've watched them just the other day my Danielle and and Judah and um and Israel got together they they I had some um some um chocolate chip cookies you know you you win the heart of a child when you're late at your cook is out there from the sea they know not to touch it but they know they can get it you understand what I mean and that's where God he laid everything out but he won't give it to you because you won't ask for it that's what this message is done it's done it's laid out all the goodies all the good things all the great things of God but we sit back there with I ain't worthy and you know maybe you know Grandpa may not give it to me well you'll never know yeah if you don't ask [Music] you say I need patience God give me patience you need love suffering God giving you know I can't ask for that because that means I'm going to suffer yes but give it to me anyhow I'd rather have something that's going to stand the stone than something that's going to sink on the pressure that's right now I I haven't even hardly touched these notes of mine but my point is this I'm trying to get us to a place that you understand that the Capstone Ministry is here it ain't in heaven no more it's here it's come down God is here and you got to understand if he's here he's ministering right like the second let's say like the coming of the Lord let's just use in tight when God promised Abraham that they were going to have a son right yeah he did it right that's right and he told Sarah you're going to have a child right but when God came again he never did visit Abraham he visited Sarah she was the one that got pregnant yeah and it was such a mystery God never told us when he did it you hear what I'm saying what we don't understand amen that when when when God come and I have to say like this because you know we get this doctor what's the difference between the coming and the appearance either way he's him yeah I get so sick and tired of these these these folks just making making any differences to be able to separate themselves what the Bible said according to Jude those who call separation is not even they don't even have the Holy Ghost that you could take that to the bank we're living in a time of unity Hallelujah and it doesn't mean that your church drawn up with mine the Bible said by one Spirit are we baptized into one's body that is the unity that God is speaking of is right yes Hallelujah so what happens it was a mystery the same woman that doubted the same woman that laughed up her sleeve was the same woman that got the visitation from the angels and where was Abraham right right somebody help me here Hallelujah he's saying there are times that God about past a man and go to the woman Mr true he did it to Joseph he did it by way of Samson you see what I'm saying so what are you saying so oh in this day you got to understand where you're standing yeah because you can't turn to William Branham now then who do you turn to Christ him yes are y'all understanding what I'm saying who is your head ship Christ who is your house did you hear me say the word it is the word but it's the Living Word hallelujah how are you there's so many people who have haven't felt the anointing in such a long time you don't even know what it is let's move on you love the Lord the Bible says you can do all the good things all the religion things you want to do you can you know you restore all your good to defeat the poor and though I give my body to be burned and people don't mind sacrificing and have not charity it profits me nothing you know what charity is the Divine love of God he didn't say though you know the faith won't he didn't say patience he said charity he came all the way up to this day put you in the worst age ever yeah yeah when hatred is everywhere wars and rumors of War people just can't stand each other somebody might look at me and say well I don't like him because I don't like his nose that's how stupid Lord forgive me but that's that's how bad people have gotten that was so quick to judge one another [Music] amen who gave you the authority we better be thankful and say God I pray that I make it Hallelujah you're so worried about everybody else and trying to say listen people of God the pot can't call the cattle black y'all looking at me like I'm crazy I'm crazy okay no I'm trying to help I'm trying to get us to see this thing that we're doing it's called religion God don't want your religion Buddha got religion Allah got religion everybody everybody got religion Christians got religion this ain't religion religion is just a covering we need salvation something that's going to change us from the inside house Hallelujah come on somebody I mean can any of you the Bible says listen Your Righteous must exceed the righteousness of what the Pharisees the Pharisees had it they had the law and they hid behind it they were dirty just like everybody else that's what every time every time I I I I I see Mary coming into Simon's house and Simon Says Mary I'll always draw the question how did Simon know Mary let your mind walk a little bit [Music] and he didn't try to stop her either so that you know all those kind of women have a black book he didn't stop her he murmured and said all that he was going to say but he didn't say it to her are you sure you see what I'm saying you see all those people all they did this is what Jesus said oh he said listen if I had not come you would have had a cloak in the last if I had not come your religions would have kept you hidden that's what about this message I love your religion won't keep you hidden the word is the sword of God it'll find you Hallelujah it doesn't matter how righteous and holy you look to one another the word of God comes to find you out Hallelujah Listen People of God I'm not interested in hiding from God and anytime you find yourself hiding sin is in the camp Hallelujah is that the truth when Adam and Eve sinned they hear from God but God Amen loved them so much he went after them that's what the word is doing right now is going after you to awaken you to the message of the hour I'm looking for a translation we hear the property God said there's nothing left but the translation the rapture that's what he said and how we think we're going to make it let me read this he said a few days ago when I was come out now because it's important this is the quote I wanted to find he said a few days ago when I come out of the most prettiest and most gorgeous place I ever saw in all my life I was the great it was the great building of our brother or Roberts and when I seen that solid marble and not a window in it nowhere but how it was fixed and I've been in Hollywood and I've been in King's palaces and I've been in everywhere that would be hardly around the world and all the swankies and lovely places and homes but I've never seen anything any place to compare with it nowhere at all how that little aluminum wire weaved and inside together and oh I had never seen anything amen so gorgeous in all my life when I walked through there and took my hand and I'm gonna tell you something here was a man with the greatest Ministry of them all that's right but in natural things he had the least of all and in The Invisible things he had the greatest of all [Music] because when he went behind the curtain he found a number that couldn't even be numbered and he said are all these branhams and the angel said no but they're your Converse he may have looked like a failure on this side but in heaven he's honored Hallelujah we don't want the world to honor us want the world to honor him and though we may go down looking like a failure we come up as winners Hallelujah glory to God call me what you want to I was telling our brother Ariel this morning I think it was this morning when God no man taught me uh who uh Malachi 4 was you know some of y'all was taught I wasn't when I heard there was supposed to be a prophet I saw God and God revealed to me now I had heard of William Branham but God revealed to me that's who he was you understand me no man didn't teach me that so no man can take it from me people can do whatever they want to y'all y'all hear what I'm saying how many people in Jesus day it was revealed to him he was the Messiah Hallelujah with all of the Miracles he did you think all of Israel would have followed him but no sir and he was the one that was supposed to be with him fled when the persecution came but there was only one who stood by him and that was the Bride of Jesus Christ by the name of John Hallelujah the bride will never forsake Him the god bride will never run under fear she'll stand right there that's right she attempts she's time tested Hallelujah you're the only one of all the generations that has literally you don't see it but I'm gonna say it anyhow he is literally translated to you when the prophet of God came and he broke that Vision about the Millions the number no man can how many of you saw yourself you was translated you was moved into that dimension by your spirit oh God is that the truth he said I don't believe that well let me tell you something television does it that's right television moves your spirit right into that Dimension right right like I was telling somebody the other day and um they used to be a soap opera on television called the name uh I think Dallas or something and they had a man by the name of TJ or some kind of Jay I never looked at that stuff but you know when you work around Sinners they used to oh I just can't stand it but you know what people would run home and see that picture and they would get into it as if they were part of the actor how many of y'all y'all know what I'm talking about yeah I mean we can watch basketball game football game all of a sudden we're on the field you're in your living room but you're in the field and when that guy makes a touchdown you up out of your chair yeah you forgot where you were because you have moved your spirit into that Dimension and you're there [Music] see this is what the message come for us to do we're not supposed to read it we supposed to let our spirit move into that dimension we become the word in that dimension and y'all understanding what I'm saying I'm so happy I don't know what to do I feel like popcorn I'm not ready to pop y'all hear what I'm saying it's your approach to this message you can't get this corner minded you listen to the tape and you got a zillion things going on you ain't gonna get nothing hardly ever nothing you gotta sit down reverence it respect it in order to get something when you sit down and reverence it and you listen to it oh I just love it when I'm oh time's like oh my God I I find myself just crying ugly y'all know what I'm saying yeah I'm not just saying crying I mean crying ugly brother feels so cool good y'all understand me what happens it may have been preached in 1963 but it's real to me Hallelujah showing me that that word doesn't stop is eternal [Applause] but if you don't approach it in the restaurant that's the king's word you 'll go to any kind of way s there have been times I've been listening to the message with my hat on him and get convicted take your hat off it ain't the man it's the god behind the man you don't you don't respect it you're not going to get nothing that's right you got to respect her yes Hallelujah are you all right with this amen I'm almost I'm gonna say I'm almost done because I don't know hallelujah amen right listen and when when it comes to the the you know you know brother but I'm saying you know it was just so beautiful and how it it was just wonderful he said but I stood on the outside and looked back at the building and I thought God surely I've become a hypocrite surely I've become an outcast somewhere how many of y'all have ever felt like that you feel like you've done your best and you still feel like you've been outcast huh you and your in this message you think to yourself Lord am I the only one trying to live it anybody know what I'm talking about sometimes you feel like you're all by yourself no you're not there others are trying Hallelujah some of us get a little bit more victories than others but there are those who are still trying yeah but that's the devil ministering to your mind you know like like I try to tell people when you the devil said you're so lonely and you say yes I'm so long you know you're not Jesus said I'll never leave you nor will I forgive us hallelujah and when those lonely spirits come upon you that's God knocking at your door I want some fellowship you won't flash but God wants you use it when Satan comes in there like that use it yeah oh you trying to make me lonely I'm going to listen to me or tape I'm going to listen to somebody I'm going to pre you understand me and sometimes when my mind is so bogged up with crazy stuff in life you know what I do I put me some music on I believe that music comes the Savage Beast Hallelujah amazing and that song that I sang last night you know uh I love you Lord yes that's my song I didn't sing it like I really wanted to sing it last night but let me tell you something me and Jesus not had a good time with that one do y'all have songs like that Hallelujah how many times when nobody was there to comfort you all of a sudden a song come to your mind and you wonder where it's coming from God just emailed it to you [Applause] Eternal mail right he just emailed it to you and you don't even think that's that's God I want to be so sensitive to him you know like when the wind blow I want to say Lord is that you my friends used to make fun of me because I used to be and I'm trying to get not just there but beyond where I was but I was you know I used to fast and pray so often in my in me and Jesus was me and Jesus that's just before I got married and um you know there are times I would sneezing I'm like oh excuse me Jesus and they would laugh at me but that what would that's what would come out right but they kept working me and then all of a sudden I you know you see what I'm saying they were persecuting me without me realizing that's what they were doing but I had such a respected relationship with him you understand me now this has nothing to do with my marriage I'm just saying it was before then God has been good to me Hallelujah yes Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord what what is it what is it that I feel he said surely I become an outcast somewhere for these men Ministries come off of mine he said these Ministries came from me off of mine think about it and yet God gives them all of that and I just got a little room with a little table hmm you haven't been to Brandon Tabernacle back then a little room a little table a little typewriter whatever it was and these people got machines and everything else wouldn't you feel bad wouldn't you feel like something must be wrong what am I doing wrong Lord am I too hard on the people let me tell you something when it comes to your soul a preacher should never be too hard for you oh my God if you can't stand correction the Bible said you are bastard children I'm wrong let it hardly let it cut me but I want to know when I'm wrong Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] I don't want nothing coming after me Hallelujah let off it all before me I don't oh nothing coming after me I want to fix everything now and we're afraid of people what people think who cares there ain't nobody nobody not even me we can't put each other in heaven why do you care what people think about you let me tell you you see this Flash while you're in this flesh you're gonna make mistakes huh oh I'm the bride you gonna make mistakes [Music] the only one man that doesn't make mistakes is the man on the inside and who's going to judge which sin is greater than the other Jesus had that situation settled didn't he yeah yeah and he asked those group of people that accused that woman and said let him without sin cast the first stone he didn't even say let him that never did this act cast the verse on he said let him who is without sin he covered all yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh I asked you today if he or any of you without sin and the Bible said if you you say I've never seen if I don't I don't it's the Bible said you make it a human liar let's move on I know what brother Brown is I know what the word of God says that once you get the Holy Ghost and everything you you are Justified as though you've never sinned in the first place and I love that because that's the way I live my life I live my life with all my mistakes as though I've never sinned in the first place that's what gives me joy to know that he's already erased it oh somebody maybe I'm crazy but I like it this way Hallelujah yes I know some of y'all thinking about food don't even think about it it ain't deadly come on come on well maybe it's already maybe it is but but my point is people of God this is more this is more important than your food out there yeah yeah that's what that's the word Jesus said I have meat [Music] that you know not of he was talking about the word it sustains me it keeps me going Hallelujah let me get to the end of this thing you love the Lord he said when I stood outside there we just couldn't hardly Catch My Breath from such Majesty that a poor boy born in a Dugout a Pentecostal could do and bring that into that great Mammoth building and I thought oh my God maybe I am not worthy then just did just then a little voice came down through those corridors and said but I am your portion you hear what I'm saying what was it he had done all of that work and you know I the Easter Easter uh travel so much now we don't need Super highways we don't have no idea what it used to be like and he would get tired and then he would call that tiredness the lust of the flesh he want to sleep and he's calling it The lust of the flag oh God I said God I'm I'm a real sinner you understand what I mean but the point is he knew he had a duty he had a position he had a place to be and he knew he had to be to that place and he saw every adversity everything that came against him uh to keep him from that place he saw it as the enemy and what we do we give up where it must not have been the Lord's will how are you going to know if you didn't even fight you just take it as a large will because it's a hindrance it's not necessarily you need to fight God if you don't want me to go here if you don't want me to do this show me oh sister said Amen brother Brooks a sister had a dream and she saw this bad thing happened to me but I feel like I need to go to this place but she said if uh if something's gonna go back I say sister let me tell you something did God tell you to go go don't care about no dream yeah yes did you know this those ministers that were supposed to come those Chicago preachers that were supposed to come and meet brother Branham for a baptism you know what they had somebody speaking tongues and interpreted and said it was wrong that what brother Branham said was wrong and 400 people 400 ministers listened to an interpretation which was false let me tell you something I know the voice of God that's the only reason why I'm in Iowa it was God who took me there it wasn't a man it wasn't money it wasn't popularity it wasn't anything like that it was a leadership of God and when you know when God tells you to do something you better do it and the thing is you think you're gonna have it a smooth ask Moses about it God said I'm going to take you're going to go and take these kids to these people to the promised land and guess what Pharaoh so it ain't gonna happen Pharaoh comes after them Hallelujah momentarily Moses forgot his Commission and he began to cry out let me tell you something that's when God works his best when things come upon you unexpectedly yes that's when God shows himself God is that right when God had those disciples amen going across the sea and all of a sudden the Storm come up unexpectedly but God had given them the authority to rebuke and to bring on everything under control but instead they Cried unto Jesus Lord carrot thou not wake up Karen thou not that I perish and Jesus got up there and said peace be still Hallelujah is that right he didn't wring his hand he didn't say oh my God what's going on it was controlled his faith never wavered he knew who he was and he understood his Commission somebody help me here and then they said what kind of man is this that even the wind in the CEO Bay brother Bradley said they had it wrong it wasn't a man that stopped the storm it was God that stopped the storm Hallelujah you need to give God his place in your life let him do through you walking through you what he's ordained to work through you unexpectedly things happens and we get all excited oh my God why be why not you right now huh we do it that he that Sarah Venetian woman brother when her baby died she would have my woman when her baby died right amen everybody around who is excited she didn't get excited she said I got one goal I don't tried everything and everything has failed find me let's get up into this prophet yeah that's right you understand me in other words she was typing out as God I know God is in him I know it ain't the man but I won't I want to go where he is y'all hear what I'm saying so what happens you said listen don't stop at no yield don't stop it no stop sign don't y'all do this now said I heard brother Brook said you could no no I'm just letting you see how desperation works right y'all understand me my wife and I this is a situation with my when my baby had a epilepsy and here the devil always would act up every time I go across Seas or somewhere out of town she would have a an attack but but one day he the devil I was there I felt an insult y'all look at me like I'm crazy I talked to that devil I said you got a nerve to come in my house [Music] you got a nerve to come in mouth and do this to my child but my wife being a mother she don't remember this part we have a staircase I said Ruby give me the baby I'm running I running after her up the stairs I thought she'd giving the baby up the stairs she'd run back down my wife God knew what he was doing when he gave her me yeah yeah no no other woman could have put up with me I'll be honest with you I've been a real case some men won't acknowledge that but it's true yeah raising eight kids and and a ninth one me don't remember but that just shows you what desperation does when desperation you lose it something moves in a certain way but anyway to make a long story short God revealed to her what we should do and she want we we was to take those clothes and rip them off the baby and burn them we did it and my daughter never had another seizure and she's a smart girl maybe too smart but she's a smart girl right but my point is amen when you wait on God God will answer Hallelujah is that all right it happens throughout the scriptures they get excited oh Moses Moses we're not what we're going to do but not Jesus now my question my thing is this it comes through consecration yeah when Jesus is in control you're out of control and Jesus will never panic hmm he'll never panic you love the Lord Hallelujah now uh he said the Lord is my portion can I give it a few more minutes because what are we going to do afterwards right just like I tried to tell my people just just act like you're looking at a movie right you'll sit there three hours or so you know somebody and just think you're not gonna get up when the best part getting ready to come right yeah so let's let's just carry on like that so my but he goes on and says listen I'm your portion yeah this message is supposed to be your portion I'm not talking about the letter form there's so many people could Out quote me when it comes to this message but it must live it must live through you hear what I'm saying it live we well you know we can we can always look back systematically and say well brother Randall it ain't about him no more it's you oh y'all got quiet it shows that you've been brainwashed [Music] let me explain myself the message and Prophet we can never deny what he did but the truth of the matter is it's about you now he's done what he's supposed to do come on somebody on the wings of a snow white dove he said the message made it home yes you understand me and don't you think you're gonna make it to Heaven because you can know you know who the prophet of God is amen God Jesus himself told Nicodemus you must be born again y'all understand me so so you can understand what I'm trying to say Elisha would have never gotten the double portions until he saw Elijah Lee absolutely hello somebody what was it so Elijah leave that's what Elijah said if you see me go I give it to you and the double portion of the anointing fell only life's shot and he never said where is Elijah he knew where Elijah was but he said where is the god of Elijah that's what that's what we want we want Niger IA Hallelujah think about it think about the people that I'ma bring it to all they think about the people in the message or thought they were in the message and never knew Jesus never came to know Christ but they could outquote you they knew how to live legalistically Hallelujah you have to criticize you Hallelujah but that's not on their door when death knocks on your door he wants to see one thing and that's the token when I see the blood I'll pass over here not the knowledge of your head but God is flesh that's you and brother Bradley he went on to say to God who was a messiah was that Messiah is in you you become Messiah this ain't no feeling thing oh I feel like it no it's a reality when you know who's in the house somebody help me here the Bible said you are the temple of God you're the temple of God God is in you and we think he's a million miles away when he said he's in you walk and talk like he's in you you love the Lord Hallelujah like I said since 1965 how far have we moved I can tell you what we've done this split split split split split now who's behind that right don't worry God is still working a masterpiece Hallelujah don't you worry the pride is not defeated Hallelujah and every promise God will bring us back together not by buildings but by the feeling of the Holy Ghost by an adoption that he promised us just like I said to you yesterday my inheritance is the inheritance of his his kingship Hallelujah he called me a king he called me a priest oh come on somebody yes inheritance amen is his Mountain is that right the same Mountain the almighty God will be setting on we'll be setting off Hallelujah yes sir I'ma close but let me tell you something this is this is one of the quotes that has always stuck with me once I read it hallelujah it's coming from amen the message of Melchizedek 1955. but this is always stuck with me and I can't get over it because I don't like to be uh I don't like to have all this drama when something happens but anyway coming from the 39th paragraph he said if we approach this subject today real sensibly calmly never be excited faith never gets excited y'all believe that faith never gets excited faith never rushes itself Faith knows what it's talking about you've never seen a master excited about anything standing by the grave of a dead man he was just as calm as he was when he sat on the mount and looked over Jerusalem think about it when he went to Tabitha's house how they laughed at him made fun of him he never moved he didn't get angry he didn't start calling people names help us Jesus right I stand on the trouble hearing says standing on the trouble not the trouble squishing me down but I'm standing on it the trouble oh and the waves tossed about he was so completely arrested in God until it never he it never even paid any attention to it enough to wake up always undisturbed faith is now we find here that the reason that we can be undisturbed because it was given to Our Father Abraham to his children and God who gave the promise swore by an oath that he would confirm it and keep it and that he has done you understand me the reason why amen we get so excited and so upset at times is because we're not consecrated yes right but when you're consecrated in God nothing
