[33:25] let's just remember the believers and uh

[33:37] covert situation that the lord will just
[33:40] strengthen the faith of the believers

[33:46] children of god and the law we make
[33:48] provision for those that don't have
[33:50] faith
[33:50] maybe the fasting can be their salvation
[33:53] as their
[33:54] fasting can save them from the from the
[33:56] virus not the salvation of their soul
[33:59] but the blessing can be able to help
[34:00] them in this time of needs

[57:29] what if you didn't bring your bible
[57:30] tonight you'll have to share with
[57:32] someone
[57:34] the the system
[57:37] choose to update himself this evening so
[57:41] we will not be having much of a
[57:45] projection tonight so
[57:56] it's just a simple way to remind us that
[57:58] we can rely on technology
[58:03] praise the lord you have to keep your
[58:07] bibles
[58:09] you have to keep your bibles and you
[58:11] have to have to fall in love with those
[58:13] psalms and
[58:14] and know them and uh because if we
[58:17] cannot project a son
[58:19] that would not stop us from having a
[58:20] song service
[58:23] praise the lord
[58:26] and uh
[58:28] [Music]
[58:30] i mean we've uh every wednesday night we
[58:33] try to have a little
[58:37] portion of time to be able to pray
[58:39] together
[58:41] and i think they should be able to
[58:43] encourage us
[58:45] young people and every one of us to
[58:48] bring a prayer request for somebody i
[58:51] mean don't go
[58:52] there without thinking about somebody
[58:54] that is in need you have in french
[58:56] you're having loved ones you're having
[58:58] co-worker i mean
[59:00] to just go through the entire week and
[59:02] don't see someone that is in need it's
[59:04] impossible
[59:06] you know you don't have to know the
[59:08] person they don't have to be related to
[59:10] you
[59:11] i mean
[59:16] revelation chapter 20
[59:21] revelation chapter 20.
[59:30] i don't know where i'll really be able
[59:31] to do justice to this but
[59:33] uh talking about a just god you don't
[59:36] worry about justice because he knows how
[59:38] to do justice amen
[59:43] it's not whether i would do justice but
[59:46] whether he would do justice
[59:49] praise the lord revelation chapter 20
[59:53] and i saw an angel come down from heaven
[59:56] having the key of the bottomless pit
[59:59] and a great chain in his hands
[1:00:04] and he lay hold on
[1:00:08] the dragon thou o serpent which is the
[1:00:11] devil
[1:00:12] satan and bound him a thousand years
[1:00:17] praise the lord
[1:00:21] and cast him into the bottomless pit
[1:00:24] and shot him up and set a
[1:00:27] seal upon him that he
[1:00:31] should that he should deceive the
[1:00:35] nations
[1:00:36] no more till the thousand years
[1:00:39] should be fulfilled and after that
[1:00:43] he must be lose a little season
[1:00:47] praise the lord amen
[1:00:50] after the thousand years he must be lose
[1:00:54] a little season the lord bless you have
[1:00:56] your seat we continue to read
[1:01:05] after the thousand years he must be lose
[1:01:09] a little season and i
[1:01:12] saw thrones and they sat
[1:01:15] upon them and joshua was giving unto
[1:01:17] them
[1:01:18] and i saw the souls of them that were
[1:01:22] beheaded
[1:01:23] for the witness of jesus and for the
[1:01:26] word of god
[1:01:28] and which ha now
[1:01:31] worship the beast neither his image
[1:01:34] neither has received
[1:01:37] his mark upon their forehead
[1:01:40] all in their hands and they leave
[1:01:44] and reign with christ a thousand years
[1:01:48] praise the lord are we together amen
[1:01:53] have you started thinking about what you
[1:01:55] would do for the thousand years
[1:01:58] praise the lord amen
[1:02:01] one thing for sure is the other whatever
[1:02:04] we plan
[1:02:05] in this life this present life does not
[1:02:08] does not last it does not always come to
[1:02:11] the way we think about it
[1:02:12] it does not come to pass the way we
[1:02:14] think about it praise the lord
[1:02:17] but uh whatever you plan for the
[1:02:18] thousand years
[1:02:21] will surely be setting
[1:02:24] praise the lord it will surely be
[1:02:32] setting
[1:02:45] i don't have ten thousand friends so i
[1:02:48] plan to spend
[1:02:50] a hundred years with each of my friends
[1:02:54] just to visit with them
[1:02:57] praise the lord and then the rest i
[1:02:59] would do it with
[1:03:01] other things i'm still thinking about
[1:03:05] verse five but the rest of the dead
[1:03:09] lived not again until the thousand years
[1:03:13] were finished this is
[1:03:16] the first resurrection
[1:03:20] praise the lord
[1:03:23] blessed and holy is he that have path in
[1:03:26] the first resurrection
[1:03:29] on such the second death had no power
[1:03:32] but there shall be priests
[1:03:36] of god and of christ and shall reign
[1:03:39] with him
[1:03:40] a thousand years praise the lord
[1:03:44] and when the thousand years are expired
[1:03:49] satan shall be loosed out of his prison
[1:03:56] and shall go out to deceive
[1:04:01] the nations which are in
[1:04:05] the four quarters of the earth god and
[1:04:08] my god
[1:04:09] to gather them together to battle
[1:04:13] the number of whom
[1:04:16] is as the saint of the sea
[1:04:20] praise the lord now
[1:04:25] uh i will stop there for the reading
[1:04:28] tonight
[1:04:37] okay because if if i go any further it
[1:04:40] might start leading me into something
[1:04:42] else
[1:04:44] and uh i have few thoughts around what
[1:04:47] we have just read but i want to i just
[1:04:49] want to dwell on something tonight
[1:04:52] that uh if i would use for the title i
[1:04:54] would say
[1:04:55] death does not change your nature
[1:04:59] death does not change your nature
[1:05:04] praise the lord death does not change
[1:05:07] your nature
[1:05:08] brother branham says recognizing your
[1:05:10] day and his message he says when you die
[1:05:14] when you leave this word your nature
[1:05:16] doesn't change
[1:05:18] if you if you are a liar now
[1:05:22] you will be a liar there if you
[1:05:25] are a hot-headed year you will be
[1:05:27] hot-headed there
[1:05:29] if you are a doubter year you will be a
[1:05:32] doubter
[1:05:33] there now so you see that's the reason
[1:05:36] why
[1:05:36] you cannot take the new birth for
[1:05:39] anything
[1:05:41] you cannot take the new birth for
[1:05:44] anything
[1:05:46] than what it is
[1:05:50] you cannot take the new birth for church
[1:05:52] membership you cannot take the new birth
[1:05:54] for being in the message
[1:05:56] you cannot take the new birth for coming
[1:05:58] to church
[1:06:00] you have to be born again
[1:06:05] praise the lord the new birth is the
[1:06:08] changing
[1:06:09] of your nature
[1:06:15] praise the lord if you take the new
[1:06:18] breath for anything and come
[1:06:20] short of your nature being changed you
[1:06:23] will surprise yourself
[1:06:26] because death does not change your
[1:06:28] nature
[1:06:30] it only change your dwelling place
[1:06:36] are we together
[1:06:39] now you'll soon see while i read this
[1:06:41] because
[1:06:42] this is the reason why i read this i was
[1:06:45] i was looking at things
[1:06:47] around the battle of god imago i was
[1:06:50] doing doing a study
[1:06:53] something that attracted my attention to
[1:06:55] to that
[1:06:57] but and then uh reading this portion
[1:07:01] we realize that the battle of god and
[1:07:04] margaret comes right after the
[1:07:06] millennium
[1:07:08] now because
[1:07:11] because the battle of god and margaret
[1:07:14] comes
[1:07:15] right after the millennium many
[1:07:19] has turned to believe that
[1:07:23] uh uh you know during the thousand year
[1:07:27] reign
[1:07:28] because see how see how it could sound
[1:07:32] logical praise the lord if satan
[1:07:36] will go and deceive the nations
[1:07:40] then there might be nations in the
[1:07:43] millennium
[1:07:47] praise the lord it could sound
[1:07:51] logical but go back to the scripture
[1:07:54] the bible says the rest of the dead
[1:07:59] lived matt for a thousand years
[1:08:04] except those that did
[1:08:07] not have no fellowship with the beast
[1:08:09] system
[1:08:14] based on their brother branham
[1:08:16] established the millennium to be
[1:08:19] a honeymoon for the bride
[1:08:23] praise the lord
[1:08:28] he is he he established the millennium
[1:08:30] to be
[1:08:31] a honeymoon the millennium to be the
[1:08:33] time because
[1:08:34] satan will be bound for a thousand years
[1:08:37] it's a chain of circumstance
[1:08:39] you will not think an evil thought
[1:08:43] there will not be one line praise the
[1:08:47] lord
[1:08:48] that's word isaiah said even the fool
[1:08:51] will not make an error
[1:08:54] he says the fool will not earth therein
[1:08:59] praise the lord amen
[1:09:02] now well so will there be food there
[1:09:06] praise the lord amen
[1:09:09] amen now so you see there there is there
[1:09:12] is uh there is
[1:09:13] there is a lot of uh a line of thoughts
[1:09:16] around this subject
[1:09:17] but but this attract me yeah there's uh
[1:09:20] that's that's what brought me to this
[1:09:22] what we are talking about tonight
[1:09:24] uh and and i will share that with you
[1:09:27] now
[1:09:27] because when satan is lost
[1:09:31] he will go about deceiving the nations
[1:09:34] so it could sound logical
[1:09:39] praise the lord and there are other
[1:09:41] scriptures
[1:09:42] also uh psalm chapter 2 where the bible
[1:09:46] talks about
[1:09:47] you know uh uh making uh
[1:09:50] having the rod of iron and ruling over
[1:09:52] the nation brother branham
[1:09:54] also tied that to be a millennial
[1:09:56] promise
[1:09:59] because he said you know a bride would
[1:10:02] not
[1:10:03] root over a bride if we were rude there
[1:10:05] must be people for us to rule over
[1:10:10] praise the lord so you see there are a
[1:10:12] lot there
[1:10:13] there are a lot of thoughts that run in
[1:10:16] that direction but
[1:10:18] follow me a little bit you will see
[1:10:19] where i'm going tonight with this thing
[1:10:22] praise the lord amen
[1:10:29] now so brother i'm talking a year and
[1:10:31] says uh
[1:10:32] your death does not change your nature
[1:10:35] he says
[1:10:35] men women it's time to shake yourself
[1:10:40] and to examine yourself and see where
[1:10:43] you are standing
[1:10:45] for death does not change
[1:10:51] the death does not change it
[1:10:56] they have gone for 2 000 years he's
[1:11:00] talking about moses and elijah
[1:11:03] praise the lord amen and then
[1:11:06] trying to identify the two witnesses in
[1:11:09] revelation chapter 11
[1:11:11] as moses and elijah because of
[1:11:15] their nature or because of what they did
[1:11:18] what they manifested won't cause fire
[1:11:21] down from heaven the other one turn
[1:11:23] water into blood
[1:11:25] praise the lord amen so that's why he's
[1:11:28] putting moses and elijah
[1:11:30] into this uh uh reading tonight
[1:11:35] he says and yeah they turn with the same
[1:11:39] nature
[1:11:39] and do the same thing death does doesn't
[1:11:42] do
[1:11:43] nothing to a man but change his dwelling
[1:11:46] place
[1:11:48] doesn't change your nature
[1:11:53] praise the lord and the only thing that
[1:11:55] can change your nature
[1:11:57] is the new birth it's for you to be born
[1:12:00] again
[1:12:02] praise the lord and before you can be
[1:12:04] born again you have to die
[1:12:09] you have to die to yourself you have to
[1:12:11] die to the things of the world
[1:12:14] for the father the mata there is that is
[1:12:16] it is the new birth that brings your
[1:12:18] death
[1:12:21] because when the new birth birth you it
[1:12:23] cuts you away
[1:12:26] it cuts your desire away
[1:12:32] praise the lord amen you know the way to
[1:12:36] test the new birth always look at your
[1:12:38] desire
[1:12:41] look at your desire
[1:12:45] praise the lord
[1:12:50] glory be to god
[1:12:56] amen
[1:12:59] that doesn't do nothing to a man but

[1:13:27] worship there

[1:13:38] and that's it that's that's going to be
[1:13:40] a big part of the 1000 years
[1:13:42] is to worship the lamb to really
[1:13:46] worship him and and express our
[1:13:49] appreciation
[1:13:50] and that's what we must do when we are
[1:13:52] singing
[1:13:54] we must learn to express our
[1:13:57] appreciation
[1:13:58] i was thinking about that the other
[1:13:59] night uh praying and uh i was just
[1:14:02] thinking about that you know how how
[1:14:03] many times do we
[1:14:05] do we really thank god
[1:14:09] for saving me do we
[1:14:13] really thank god salvation has just
[1:14:17] become
[1:14:17] an idea it's a life
[1:14:22] you feel it
[1:14:27] to really thank god thank you lord for
[1:14:31] saving me
[1:14:33] praise the lord
[1:14:39] if a car had just ran a red light
[1:14:44] and it was going to go straight into
[1:14:47] your vehicle
[1:14:48] or you crossing the road and that car i
[1:14:50] mean just
[1:14:51] just passed and you could just
[1:14:55] have the feeling as that that that's
[1:14:58] that close call to realize that
[1:15:02] i could have been dead
[1:15:15] praise the lord amen
[1:15:22] sometimes we are i mean when we get
[1:15:24] shaken or different things happening to
[1:15:26] us
[1:15:28] you know then all of those thoughts come
[1:15:30] to us it's all because we are afraid to
[1:15:32] die
[1:15:34] amen we're not ready to die so we start
[1:15:39] you know what uh uh
[1:15:42] and all of that but that does not change
[1:15:44] your nature it does not change your
[1:15:46] faith
[1:15:47] amen it doesn't change nothing
[1:15:50] in you by your dwelling place
[1:15:57] if you are a doubter of god's word
[1:16:02] you will be a doubter over there
[1:16:05] i don't care how holy you are
[1:16:08] how you live and how good
[1:16:12] you live it won't
[1:16:15] change you one bit to die
[1:16:20] just your dwelling place
[1:16:24] praise the lord amen
[1:16:27] it won't change you one bet just your
[1:16:30] dwelling place the thing about it
[1:16:32] brother brandon
[1:16:33] saying you're living a good life and
[1:16:36] sometimes many people take
[1:16:38] living a good life as being safe
[1:16:46] praise the lord man i was reading
[1:16:49] something
[1:16:50] i don't want to change from here now
[1:16:52] because i'm just call up into a lot of
[1:16:53] things
[1:16:54] so i if i if i if i decide to share any
[1:16:57] other thing
[1:16:58] it might just take me into something
[1:16:59] completely different so i would just
[1:17:01] stay right here
[1:17:02] for for the wednesday night but
[1:17:06] you i mean i mean when you when you look
[1:17:07] into that
[1:17:09] you realize that
[1:17:15] you know brother brandon was saying i i
[1:17:18] you know i say i don't want to say but
[1:17:20] it says just keep bugging me
[1:17:22] you know but i was talking about he says
[1:17:27] bitterness is the spirit
[1:17:30] of organization
[1:17:38] praise the lord amen
[1:17:42] but you can be a nice person you can be
[1:17:45] a very nice person
[1:17:48] and you can get all your morals up to
[1:17:50] date and you get all your figures
[1:17:53] up to date but
[1:17:57] to have a bitterness in your spirit
[1:18:01] you have a spirit of organization on you
[1:18:13] let's put a pause there we will come to
[1:18:15] that
[1:18:17] in the future soon future too
[1:18:21] now so you see i mean
[1:18:24] living a good life
[1:18:29] and all of that the new birth
[1:18:32] the holy ghost is on assurance
[1:18:38] it's an assurance
[1:18:42] praise the lord amen
[1:18:45] paul says he says uh uh uh uh james says
[1:18:49] uh
[1:18:49] or john right there in john is is our
[1:18:53] advocate
[1:18:58] because you see people practice to live
[1:19:01] good life and
[1:19:02] and be earnest and they try their best
[1:19:06] and then when they come to the place and
[1:19:08] feel
[1:19:11] amen they behave just like uh
[1:19:14] uh uh uh uh ahitophat uh uh david mann
[1:19:18] you know the the bible says that god was
[1:19:20] just so
[1:19:21] he was he was a man that was gifted
[1:19:25] and he had never counseled david wrong
[1:19:30] every time he give a counsel it was
[1:19:34] right
[1:19:37] so when david went away from solomon
[1:19:40] uh uh uh uh not solomon
[1:19:43] absalon when he ran away from absalom
[1:19:48] david thought about him he says oh my
[1:19:51] goodness
[1:19:54] this man his counsel is
[1:19:57] just like the oracle of god he have
[1:20:00] never been wrong
[1:20:02] praise the lord those were the kind of
[1:20:05] men that david surrounded himself with
[1:20:08] and he says i have to do something
[1:20:10] because if that man should give absalom
[1:20:14] a counsel they will get my head
[1:20:18] so david said i need somebody to get
[1:20:21] down there
[1:20:22] and give ayotte for a different message
[1:20:27] praise the lord and when he went there
[1:20:30] you know uh the man left
[1:20:32] the camp went there then uh uh uh
[1:20:35] italy has already given absalon and and
[1:20:39] his men the council
[1:20:40] say if you do this you're going to get
[1:20:42] your father
[1:20:44] don't do this and another man came
[1:20:46] quickly and he talked to the people
[1:20:48] and and he raided them you know he he
[1:20:50] took them away
[1:20:52] from the council of italy now
[1:20:55] because his council failed
[1:20:58] he hang himself because he has never
[1:21:02] failed before
[1:21:03] you see how people trust in
[1:21:07] india their their their their own
[1:21:09] righteousness or
[1:21:10] trust in their gift and and and if you
[1:21:13] do that you don't have salvation
[1:21:15] because salvation gives you
[1:21:18] a teach you how to love for mercy
[1:21:22] it teach you how to ask for forgiveness
[1:21:25] you have an
[1:21:26] assurance in you that assurance does not
[1:21:29] tell you that you don't film
[1:21:31] it tells you you feel but there is a
[1:21:33] provision
[1:21:34] you can come back and ask god for mercy
[1:21:42] praise the lord but you see brother
[1:21:44] berlin said
[1:21:45] he says the fundamental can teach this
[1:21:48] better i'm do
[1:21:49] like i'm doing tonight and yet they
[1:21:51] don't have it
[1:21:56] because it can teach you how you should
[1:21:58] how when you make
[1:21:59] wrong you can you can ask god for
[1:22:01] forgiveness
[1:22:02] we we are all sinners we all make me
[1:22:05] sick when you sin
[1:22:06] just ask god for forgiveness but you see
[1:22:08] the thing there
[1:22:09] is that it does not go down to the
[1:22:11] desire
[1:22:12] there's a constant desire to do wrong
[1:22:16] so what is happening there is that yeah
[1:22:18] i would do wrong and god will forgive me
[1:22:19] it does not work like that
[1:22:24] you don't want to do wrong it is not
[1:22:28] your desire to do wrong
[1:22:30] but yeah when you do wrong we have an
[1:22:33] advocate with the father
[1:22:39] but if it is your desire to do wrong
[1:22:41] then you need
[1:22:42] a birth
[1:22:47] you need to kill that desire you need to
[1:22:50] bring your other altar and
[1:22:52] kill it
[1:22:56] he hung himself because he had never
[1:23:00] been wrong in his counsel if he would
[1:23:03] have just stopped
[1:23:04] a why and realize that he was not wrong
[1:23:11] there was somebody that interceded
[1:23:14] his advice and changed if he could have
[1:23:18] just wait
[1:23:19] but you see that's what
[1:23:20] self-righteousness does to people
[1:23:23] they don't make you to ask questions you
[1:23:26] just
[1:23:26] judge when you hear things you just
[1:23:32] react
[1:23:38] i wonder why i said that
[1:23:43] oh wow man
[1:23:48] okay okay
[1:23:53] okay
[1:23:57] okay well maybe the lord
[1:24:02] told him to do that that's what david
[1:24:05] said
[1:24:07] and brother branham said when he said it
[1:24:09] he's for mercy with god
[1:24:16] he was not judge mentor the first time
[1:24:19] the man that did this and they must die
[1:24:22] it was a sound of guilt
[1:24:25] when we are anxious it's a sound of
[1:24:28] guilt
[1:24:34] we want to do it quake we want to go so
[1:24:38] fast so nobody can see us
[1:24:40] it's a sound of guilt
[1:24:47] praise the lord oh that's when it's so
[1:24:50] hard to close the cookie's job because
[1:24:52] the top can't screw it
[1:24:55] the arrow team is falling
[1:25:02] because you know you're stealing cookies
[1:25:18] that's when he started sinking glory to
[1:25:20] god praise the lord praise the lord
[1:25:23] they want to overcome the sound so they
[1:25:26] can say they are worshipping
[1:25:27] [Applause]
[1:25:31] been there done that
[1:25:35] praise the lord glory be to god
[1:25:44] if you are a doubter you be a doubter
[1:25:48] over there
[1:25:49] i don't care how holy you are live a
[1:25:52] good life
[1:25:54] it wouldn't change you one day living a
[1:25:57] good life won't change you
[1:26:03] i thought it is it is a change that
[1:26:06] brings a good life
[1:26:08] no you can practice a good life
[1:26:15] you can practice a good life
[1:26:19] the message say the message said the
[1:26:21] message said the message said the
[1:26:23] message say

[1:26:36] but it's not a birth
[1:26:40] is not a birth you are just providing
[1:26:44] recipe
[1:26:44] to live a good life
[1:26:47] and because you say the message say and
[1:26:50] you're doing what
[1:26:51] you say the message say it gives you the
[1:26:54] satisfaction that i mean a message
[1:26:57] because the message says i'm doing what
[1:26:59] the message says
[1:27:04] but it's not at birth
[1:27:17] we don't dress right because the message
[1:27:19] say
[1:27:20] you must dress right because you are
[1:27:23] convinced
[1:27:25] that it's the right thing to do
[1:27:31] is the right thing to do
[1:27:35] i do it because it is the right thing
[1:27:41] it's the word of god
[1:27:51] all of the people that practice how to
[1:27:53] live right
[1:27:55] when they realize that they did not had
[1:27:58] it
[1:28:00] the bible says where your treasure is
[1:28:02] that's where your heart will be
[1:28:04] they went back to their treasures and
[1:28:06] start bringing all their filthy garments
[1:28:08] up
[1:28:10] cutting their heads and and and you know
[1:28:13] dressing anyhow
[1:28:15] because they were just practicing how to
[1:28:17] live right
[1:28:27] i could stay on this tonight let's go
[1:28:29] praise the lord
[1:28:31] and if you can't accept the whole
[1:28:34] word of god the way it is written
[1:28:38] when i read that i says
[1:28:42] i says man may god help us
[1:28:47] praise the lord if you cannot accept
[1:28:51] the whole word of god the way it is
[1:28:53] written
[1:28:55] not only the one that appeared to you
[1:28:57] but the whole word of god
[1:28:59] the way it is written
[1:29:03] now all of these people that don't
[1:29:05] believe that brother branham fulfilled
[1:29:06] malachi 4
[1:29:08] and they cannot produce who's going to
[1:29:10] fulfill that
[1:29:16] praise the lord
[1:29:22] let's leave them let's talk to ourselves
[1:29:25] here a little bit i'm getting out of
[1:29:27] time
[1:29:28] yeah and i have not even done anything
[1:29:31] to this yet
[1:29:35] and if you can accept the whole word of
[1:29:37] god it's written he says
[1:29:39] you you wouldn't do it there so don't
[1:29:42] worry
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:58] you won't be there you have got to
[1:30:01] accept it in his fullness
[1:30:03] in the power of its vindication
[1:30:06] and the revelation of what it says
[1:30:10] i mean i can do earth on each of these
[1:30:12] phrases
[1:30:14] a whole night then you all become a part
[1:30:17] of it
[1:30:21] it's only his word that he will raise
[1:30:25] up it's only his word
[1:30:29] that he will raise up praise the lord
[1:30:33] you see how this will confirm what
[1:30:35] brother branham said
[1:30:37] is the word is the seed that is
[1:30:39] predestinated
[1:30:41] it's not you
[1:30:45] it's the seed the word
[1:30:48] because it's only the word he's going to
[1:30:50] resurrect
[1:30:54] that's the reason why the word quickened
[1:30:56] in your heart
[1:30:57] and you begin to believe it that it was
[1:30:59] that seed that was predestinated
[1:31:07] okay let's let's uh let's go quick here
[1:31:11] as he did his word
[1:31:15] on the first easter morning only his
[1:31:18] word
[1:31:19] came forth and those who
[1:31:23] had died in his word believing his word
[1:31:27] and vindicated his word
[1:31:30] praise the lord so brother branham said
[1:31:32] first easter
[1:31:34] what god did god resurrect his word
[1:31:37] jesus said it he said it for his
[1:31:38] destroy this body it was that word
[1:31:43] in three days i raise it up
[1:31:50] praise the lord
[1:32:15] glory be to god amen
[1:32:19] it's just like to talk what many people
[1:32:21] say is you know i i was predestinated
[1:32:24] that's what i believe the message
[1:32:30] glory be to god the message
[1:32:34] was predestinated
[1:32:38] amen for this age
[1:32:41] it was god's word for this age
[1:32:47] and god made his promise
[1:32:50] to get a people for his name's sake
[1:32:53] that's his promised word
[1:32:55] yes praise the lord
[1:33:00] so you see it is not so much
[1:33:04] of the individual is is
[1:33:07] much more of his word
[1:33:11] that he had promised his word that he
[1:33:13] has allotted
[1:33:14] for this age
[1:33:18] are we together
[1:33:27] now so let's get to this stuff but
[1:33:29] brandon says
[1:33:30] death does not change your nature
[1:33:33] as i was as i was telling this
[1:33:38] i came across this thing brother branham
[1:33:40] said
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:34:03] he said this
[1:34:06] let me let me just let me just uh rewind
[1:34:08] this to you there
[1:34:10] a lot of them he he kind of a dwarf on
[1:34:16] here
[1:34:25] this is back in uh uh question and
[1:34:27] answer
[1:34:28] 54 he says now just those
[1:34:33] those who are good people he says
[1:34:36] certainly
[1:34:37] miss the first resurrection the bible
[1:34:40] says and the rest of the dead
[1:34:42] live that until the thousand years were
[1:34:46] finished
[1:34:47] is that right that those
[1:34:50] who have their names on the line book of
[1:34:54] life
[1:34:55] but refuse the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:59] the elect goes in that time
[1:35:04] just the inlet takes the millennium
[1:35:07] oh then brother what type of people
[1:35:09] should we be
[1:35:11] i want to live through the millennium
[1:35:14] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:35:16] sin that does so easily beset us
[1:35:20] if uh if the fellow says something wrong
[1:35:26] or does something something this way
[1:35:28] pray for him
[1:35:29] and keep moving on praise the lord
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:48] okay he moved uh there also
[1:35:51] in 57 is that question and answered also
[1:35:54] and when the thousand years
[1:35:56] are expired on the earth
[1:35:59] then the devil come up and
[1:36:03] the second resurrection comes
[1:36:07] the resurrection of the unjust
[1:36:11] they gather a great army
[1:36:14] like the sand of the sea
[1:36:18] and they compass the camp
[1:36:21] of the saints now brother branham is
[1:36:25] is is interpreting the scripture and
[1:36:28] he's he
[1:36:29] what what he's placing here is that
[1:36:31] that's what i wanted to come to
[1:36:33] what he's placing here is is is
[1:36:36] different from the thought of satan
[1:36:39] being loose
[1:36:41] and and the nations that were in the
[1:36:43] millennium
[1:36:45] praise the lord going against the sins
[1:36:50] what brother branham is is saying yet in
[1:36:53] 57
[1:36:54] is that when when when uh after
[1:36:58] after the millennium there will come a
[1:37:00] resurrection
[1:37:01] a general resurrection of the unjust
[1:37:05] now many people and even scholars they
[1:37:08] struggle with that thought
[1:37:10] but you have to see that it's in the
[1:37:12] scripture
[1:37:13] why because lazarus died
[1:37:16] he lived again and he died
[1:37:23] are we together jairo's daughter died
[1:37:26] she lived again and she died
[1:37:34] are we together now when you when we get
[1:37:37] into uh uh god and my god then you're
[1:37:40] going to see the full
[1:37:41] picture the reason why uh
[1:37:45] god will have to raise these people up
[1:37:48] praise the lord and anoint them to go
[1:37:51] against the saints
[1:37:53] and destroy them there is a purpose for
[1:37:55] that we will get to that but
[1:37:57] what i wanted to bring to to you and
[1:37:59] then that was the thing that caught my
[1:38:01] attention
[1:38:02] as i was telling this thing and what i'm
[1:38:04] saying right here
[1:38:05] is he says he says and the
[1:38:08] second resurrection come the
[1:38:10] resurrection of the
[1:38:14] unjust
[1:38:17] if they were resurrected which means
[1:38:18] they die
[1:38:20] and god has to raise them up because
[1:38:24] the the the the sins in the millennium
[1:38:28] praise the lord the sins in the
[1:38:31] millennium
[1:38:34] will be the one that will be war against
[1:38:42] so you see this the two the two school
[1:38:45] of thought
[1:38:47] praise the lord amen and verb
[1:38:51] a brother brother actually present these
[1:38:52] two school of thought
[1:38:54] they in the message
[1:38:58] one school of tot
[1:39:04] the the the the bride will
[1:39:07] rule over the nation
[1:39:11] that's one school of thought
[1:39:15] praise the lord and with this school of
[1:39:18] thought which of course you cannot rule
[1:39:20] it out because it's in the scripture
[1:39:22] if the bible says the fool will not earn
[1:39:26] and i said it you can root it up
[1:39:30] amen praise the lord
[1:39:35] and the second school of thought is that
[1:39:39] it's been proven in a scripture
[1:39:43] that you know most people arguing says
[1:39:45] the bible says
[1:39:46] is appointed unto man wants to die
[1:39:50] that's the argument most scallops have
[1:39:53] it's appointed unto men wants to die
[1:39:57] so it has to be the people of the
[1:39:59] nations
[1:40:04] that when satan is turned loose that he
[1:40:07] will use to come against the saints
[1:40:11] praise the lord but you see the the
[1:40:13] place where
[1:40:14] the road gets narrow is that
[1:40:18] is that if satan if satan
[1:40:21] is bound for the thousand years we know
[1:40:24] there will be no sin that will be no
[1:40:26] evil
[1:40:28] praise the lord but you have to realize
[1:40:31] that before
[1:40:32] the millennia comes is the millennium
[1:40:36] will fulfill the scripture that says the
[1:40:39] sin will walk on the arches
[1:40:42] of the wicked that's malachi
[1:40:48] the millennial will fulfill that
[1:40:52] praise the lord amen the saints will
[1:40:56] walk on the arches
[1:40:57] of the uh of the wicked and then
[1:41:00] the millennium also fulfill
[1:41:04] the the the the the the honeymoon
[1:41:09] of the bride praise the lord
[1:41:13] i mean after the wedding who takes the
[1:41:15] whole congregation to a honeymoon
[1:41:24] praise the lord and say my honeymoon is
[1:41:26] going to be a comfort and you all are
[1:41:30] welcome
[1:41:35] and you see where i'm going so if the if
[1:41:37] the
[1:41:38] if the millennium is going to be the
[1:41:40] brice honeymoon
[1:41:41] is going to be special for the people of
[1:41:44] god
[1:41:46] the millennium is going to fulfill
[1:41:50] the one day that adam did not live true
[1:41:54] because no man lived a thousand years
[1:41:58] so no man has lived one day before god
[1:42:04] the millennium is going to take us back
[1:42:07] to eden
[1:42:12] amen before the fall
[1:42:20] are we together so if you line up these
[1:42:24] thoughts
[1:42:25] from the scripture and the message
[1:42:34] you realize that if death
[1:42:38] does not change our nature
[1:42:42] when these unjust people
[1:42:46] resurrect why because
[1:42:49] they die at the time that they died in
[1:42:52] the tribulation
[1:42:54] okay in the tribulation the time they
[1:42:56] die they die
[1:42:58] with hatred against god's people
[1:43:03] so when they resurrect they are going to
[1:43:06] resurrect with that same hatred
[1:43:11] praise the lord taking sides of jesus
[1:43:13] that's what brother branham said
[1:43:15] he says all god's people went down
[1:43:19] with an anticipation of the rapture they
[1:43:24] were looking to see the coming of the
[1:43:26] lord
[1:43:26] before they die and that's the reason
[1:43:29] why when they resurrect in the rapture
[1:43:31] they will come up with that same
[1:43:32] anticipation
[1:43:34] because death does not change your
[1:43:36] nature
[1:43:43] praise the lord
[1:43:52] it was
[1:43:55] and i mean and on and on we can go but i
[1:43:58] wanted to grab you on there tonight
[1:44:01] he says and when a thousand years is
[1:44:03] aspired on earth
[1:44:05] then the devil comes up
[1:44:08] and the second resurrection comes the
[1:44:10] resurrection of the unjust
[1:44:13] they gather a great army like the sand
[1:44:16] of the sea
[1:44:16] and they come up to compass the camel of
[1:44:20] the saints
[1:44:21] and when it come god rained down fire
[1:44:24] and brainstorms ass
[1:44:27] ring down fire the brainstorm out of the
[1:44:30] heavens and destroyed him
[1:44:32] john said i saw a new heaven
[1:44:35] in the new year the new jerusalem coming
[1:44:37] down that is that is another place there
[1:44:40] now so we will we will continue on this
[1:44:44] start
[1:44:44] but i just wanted to to uh place the
[1:44:47] scripture that we read tonight
[1:44:49] in in context of what we were talking
[1:44:51] about and and that's what i read that's
[1:44:54] that was exactly what i read from
[1:44:55] revelation chapter 20
[1:44:57] just to be able to show in the many
[1:45:00] places
[1:45:01] in the scripture where death do not
[1:45:03] change your nature
[1:45:05] there is one and there are many places
[1:45:07] in the scripture
[1:45:08] also where it is not only appointed
[1:45:12] unto man to die once
[1:45:17] scripture tells us there are many men
[1:45:20] that died twice
[1:45:24] praise the lord amen
[1:45:28] there are many men that died twice
[1:45:33] glory be to god so if you are not
[1:45:36] setting of your new birth you can die
[1:45:38] again
[1:45:41] amen you can die every service you can
[1:45:44] die
[1:45:45] every time the devil bark you with
[1:45:46] something you can die with to that
[1:45:49] nature
[1:45:51] die to lie die to lust die to evil
[1:45:56] thoughts
[1:46:00] praise the lord
[1:46:03] that's the picture of grace
[1:46:10] says oh brother you don't you don't have
[1:46:12] the new breath because
[1:46:13] you you you didn't die you still have
[1:46:15] temple no i died to lust
[1:46:18] i'm still dealing with temple i would
[1:46:20] die to temper
[1:46:22] and i would die to evil thought i would
[1:46:24] die until i got completely from this
[1:46:26] body
[1:46:27] [Applause]
[1:46:33] that the scripture prove it lazarus died
[1:46:37] twice
[1:46:39] amen even in the old testament
[1:46:43] the man that throw into elijah grave
[1:46:47] he was dead he rose up
[1:46:50] he ran after them
[1:46:54] and he died again
[1:46:59] it means that you can die constantly
[1:47:02] you can identify things in your life and
[1:47:05] you can put it under the cross
[1:47:07] and you can die to it
[1:47:13] don't let the devil say you see you
[1:47:14] still having temple it means that you
[1:47:17] you are not die yet say satan i die
[1:47:22] to lie this temple
[1:47:26] i'm going to slay it on my knees
[1:47:30] i'm going to see it with my own eyes
[1:47:35] praise the lord if god can make moses
[1:47:38] the most meekest man rob him of his
[1:47:42] temple
[1:47:45] god robbed him so much until he stumbled
[1:47:49] to talk
[1:47:52] when god took temple from him
[1:48:00] you love the lord tonight
[1:48:01] [Laughter]
[1:48:03] glory be to god oh thank you jesus
[1:48:07] what a wonderful jesus we serve praise
[1:48:10] the lord
[1:48:12] amen glory be to god
[1:48:20] these sinless perfection people they're
[1:48:21] having trouble with us
[1:48:23] because we can look through the
[1:48:25] scripture and pick those things
[1:48:26] up glory be to god
[1:48:34] you know people and that if if you see
[1:48:36] uh uh
[1:48:37] uh the interviewer sister bruce that's
[1:48:40] exactly what brother branham was
[1:48:41] pointing out to her
[1:48:46] because there was something in her life
[1:48:49] that was that was that was constantly
[1:48:52] there that she felt like she was not
[1:48:54] safe
[1:48:55] but brandon said no sister bros
[1:48:58] god changed you
[1:49:02] praise the lord because of time i
[1:49:06] couldn't can read that to you tonight
[1:49:08] but
[1:49:08] he said she said no he said look look at
[1:49:11] that she said he said i know
[1:49:12] you look at this area
[1:49:16] and and and that's what that's that's
[1:49:18] what happens
[1:49:21] but you see that's that's the plan of
[1:49:23] salvation when you learn to start
[1:49:25] thanking god
[1:49:26] for saving you not only because you are
[1:49:29] a church member
[1:49:31] but you can point in your life where you
[1:49:34] know that i used to
[1:49:35] lie
[1:49:39] i had a desire fulfilled
[1:49:44] and you can say god thank you that you
[1:49:46] took this thing away
[1:49:49] the same power that took this thing away
[1:49:51] is going to
[1:49:52] change all the things in my life
[1:49:57] then the devil has no ground to accuse
[1:50:00] you
