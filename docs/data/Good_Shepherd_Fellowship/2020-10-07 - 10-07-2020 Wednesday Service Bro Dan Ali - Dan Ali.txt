judgment so we don't have to go through it you died in our state so we could live praise be to thine holy name we thank you father we worship you tonight and we bless you oh god your sons and daughters have driven father from far and here not to come and hear the eloquence of men not to come and hear the enticing words of men's wisdom but to come and hear from you if all they drove here

into every soul that we shall never leave your presence the way we have come lord in jesus name amen praise be to god while we are so standing let us take our bibles and then turn over to christ peter thank you god bless you musicians first peter 5 8 to 10 price beta 5 8 to 10. i read be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion what if about seeking whom he may divorce whom resist steadfast in faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of all grace who have called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish stranding settle you praise be to god shall we be seated god bless your sins and is happy to see you once again i have just been living in in the sunday atmosphere all along it was just so wonderful it was beyond explanation [Music] yeah there were moments i just had to comfort myself from running in to just come and stand there and shout amen but i didn't want it to be a distraction praise be to god oh my the lord our god is good whatever we need to be successful in this journey he has provided we don't make it we have no excuse we are destined to make it we are bound to make it all hell can never stop the program of god praise be to god we started this the greatest battle ever fought last week and um just covered a part of it and by the grace of god we are going to continue i wouldn't say we are going to continue from where we stopped because honestly speaking i don't even remember where we stopped praise be to god it was one of a kind i wouldn't want to go into it so much let god have his way now from the scripture we just read the bible says be sober and be vigilant as somebody will say open your eyes because our adversary the devil we have only one adversary your neighbor is not your adversary your brother is not your adversary your sister is not your adversary i don't care how hard they step on your toes they are not your adversary the devil as we said is always using a human being he is always looking for a vessel to use and he is only using that vessel if we can only look beyond the vessel the devil is using to see who is behind it will solve a lot of our headaches but a lot of the times we leave the person who is on behind the scenes pulling the strings and we are dealing with a person and we don't achieve any result when a firefighter comes into the house that is burning they don't go after the flames they are looking for the source of the fire because they know when they get the source of the fire they can contain the flame but so long as they are fighting the flame they know they are fighting a lost battle if we can only look beyond the vessels that the devil is using and go after the devil it will stop a lot of the headaches praise be to god be vigilant be sober because your adversary the devil as a ruling lion whatever about as a roaring lion as a roaring lion you can underline that praise be to god how many of us here have seen the sea roar how many of us here i know we are living in minnesota we just have lakes and rivers here praise be to god now when you see the west of the sea belowing or coming sometimes it's about three four stories high and if you see a ship on the sea you will think the wave is just coming to cover it up and destroy it but what does it do it only comes and disappears beneath it and then lifts it high oh let's use a cipher how many know who a surfer is they are on something like a plank i would never do that and then they are on the sea and you will see them they will just go so high and come so so so low and they are there just enjoying the waves and you will see a wave that is coming about three four stories high and you are just looking at them and you think that oh this wave is just coming to cover them up and that will be the end but the wave just comes and then disappears beneath them and it leaves them so so so high in the air and they come so you know what that is what the devil does the devil oppressed by fear god does not operate by fear god are praised by faith we have not received the holy spirit again to fear praise be to god when the devil is coming he comes as a ruined life like the west of the sea and when you tremble and fear takes over the devil has no work to do anymore because whatever it is that the devil is coming to do you would have done part of it already so he comes and then he accomplished just go through the rest but you started it but if you can stay your grounds as the devil comes and if you can stay your grounds i can assure you by the word of god that the devil is going to be nothing but a full stool the way he comes that is the same way he's going to disappear under your feet the bible says he's as good as our just he's he's just a rag that we work on we know if i can just take a little bit of this praise be to god whom resisted first in faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brain that are in the world look don't let it look like it is you whatever it is that you're going through don't let it look like you're the only person going through that before you thousands of people had already gone through that and as you are going through it now thousands of people are also going through it and if christ carries after we are dead and gone thousands of people will still go through it we are fighting a common enemy whatever it is that you are going through others are going through it and if others can be faithful and brave the storm if they can be faithful and brave the song what it means is that you can also do it you can also do it praise be to god now we are talking about the greatest battle ever fought let's turn our bibles to daniel 12. it was one of those scriptures that prophet used daniel 12 he read from but i'll just take i think the first verse at that time daniel 12 at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at the time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found in the book praise be to god praise be to god our names are written in the book our names are in the last book of life nothing can take it out it's written in the ink in the blood that was shed for our for for us nothing can erase it when you look in the bible and you don't see your name look again your name is hiding somewhere there praise be to god that is why when you hear the word of god you can't just help it but enjoy it because you are part of what god is doing in this day and age that when you hear the word of god you can't help it but shout amen to the glory of god praise be to god the bible says at that time at what time at what time michael is going to stand up for thy people the bible is talking of this time and remember this greatest battle ever fought started in heaven against god and satan and he was defeated then and what it means is that if michael is going to stand for us that means he is already defeated again i didn't say he is going to be defeated i am not talking of something in the future i am talking of present tense he is already defeated amen praise be to god as the prophet of god said it is not the size of the dog in the fight by the size of the fight in the dark and i don't think anybody understands this better than i do and i want to tell you why growing up i was a very very bad boy i was born and bred in the barracks in the army barracks my dad was a soldier and uh they the children in the bus don't fear anything so and my dad again was a boxer in the army so he put a sack he just filled it with sand and then he was teaching me how to box and i was very good i didn't fear anything when i schooled we had we had four schools all put together and if you saw people in a ring shouting five out of ten you come and meet me inside there and i'll be the one boxing and i was good i didn't fear anything but my dad went on pension and we left a cry and went to a place called tamale one morning i don't remember where i was going i was just going this tiny guy was looking at me and i was looking at him and then i stopped then he stopped then he started speaking his dialect i didn't know what he was talking about then i also started speaking three one of the popular languages in ghana and then he said something i also said something and then we drew closer i said i'll beat this boy today so i gave him a blow he dodged another one then he dodged and then all i saw was that my legs went into the air my goodness he whipped me to the ground so when i woke up about nine o'clock in the morning i saw stars so when i woke up i looked at this boy and then i started dressing back and then he stood there you'll he shouting he was ready for more but i wasn't ready for anything then i started so it was a very very small bush path so i just looked on the left looked on the right there was nobody coming i just cleaned myself as a brother team used to say he says small shame is better than big shame i said this when i have taken this enough then i started going and he pumped up i said no i'm not standing for anything so that was where my boxing career ended so it is not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog and for you to know that the battle is not your battle but god's battle praise be to god that should settle it that should settle in the matter that the battle is not yours if it is yours you have every cost worry but it is god's own battle god is the one fighting the battle praise be to god so what is your worries i love that song i have forgotten what song it is but the song says that is it one step no i'm not very sure but just to paraphrase things the musician was saying that every step i think one step one step along i don't remember now when he she takes a step wait a minute it goes like this that she got into the storm and then she thought she was by herself and she started complaining and asking god why is it that i got in the thickest storm at a point i was expecting you the most and you abandoned me and god said no i didn't abandon you those steps you saw in the sand and thought they were your steps that was the time i was carrying you those steps you saw they were my steps i don't know how many remember that song praise be to god so the battle is not our battle it's god's own battle to fight and as a matter of fact none of us there is no body that is a match for satan but he that is least in the kingdom of god the devil is no match to that person the devil has been in this game for very long how can you outsmart him if tried after she knew what god wanted them to do but here comes the devil he will not come and tell you that everything you are hearing is false but he just add a little or takes a little out you know human beings sometimes we put ourselves somewhere and then we begin to compare ourselves with others and then we have a either a book or a register and then we say okay uh this is where i go wrong it's only one but i know of this brother or this sister who has 20 things wrong and i know of somebody else who has 50 wrong mine is just only one so i am good you are not good you are as guilty as somebody that is doing everything wrong because the bible says that he that offense in one is guilty in all if the devil can get you to believe that by doing only one thing wrong you are better than somebody who is doing 100 things wrong you have gotten it wrong praise be to god thank you brother god bless you i didn't know i was sweating oh my yeah that is what happens if you don't grow here yes so the devil has been in this game for a very long time longer than any of us that is why you don't have to risen the word of god because he would outristen you you can't all your years of education can never come anywhere close for you to reason with the devil and succeed now i have my phd as a matter of fact those who have a lot of those degrees there are those that are even further away from god you can't outraise in him the bible says he is cunning he is subtle you don't stop to raising with the enemy just look around here in america we used to read about it in in the by amina in the bible about sodom and gomorrah and here we are living in that condition that they are not even ashamed that they can come out and they have more rights and privileges than you and i have and you find very nice people nice people they will tell you that oh i was supposed to be a man and i was born a woman i was supposed to be a woman and i was born a man the devil has given them enough reason to believe what they are doing and they are doing it without any form of shame transgenderism don't reason with the enemy one day my wife and i went to somewhere to shop they heard that they had a sale we entered i saw a lady and i said hi and then somebody responded i had to turn back i was thinking for the voice the voice of a man in a woman how do you explain that don't ever reason with a word we are not called to reason we are called to belief it may not make sense to you it doesn't have to make sense to you if you are only believing because it makes sense then why lies your faith faith is when you can believe even when it doesn't make sense that you are ready to die for it because you believe that is the truth and why should man even fear death why should man even fear death the devil's west would only bring the best out of you his worst would bring the best out of you me three times god took me out of death the devil can never scare me with death anytime god is ready for me i am ready to go home the devil can never scare me with death and a child of god the devil can never scare you with death the bible has made it clear it's appointed unto man wants to die that would come when it's ready and we are here to serve the purpose of god when that purpose is over it can be a single a little headache you can just go to bed and that is the end of the story you have done your work you have done your work but until then let all of hell come against you and praise be to god you are going to be vindicated by the grace of god praise be to god don't let fear ruin your experience with god the devil oppressed with fear so much as long as god leaves you keep going fear is not our portion praise be to god we also saw the devil in the in in in the man of gagara who was possessed by legends of demons he was so strong he will beat everything and kill everything till he was living in the tombs they couldn't tame him you think about the demon in goliath goliath the demon in goliath that would come and call the bluff upon the children of god call them names and the king and his generals didn't know what to do this was a human mountain a vicious person that had fought was all his life he was killed he knew that out of war he was amped to the teeth and his head was probably would probably go through this roof he was a giant that is how the devil always comes but don't forget that it is not the fight it is not the size of the dog it is the size of the fight in the dark don't look at the storm the size of the storm tell god at his word when god says much forward much forward when he says keep still keep still don't look at the size of the storm when david came on the scene and he saw how this man was defying the people of god he said no i am going to fight this man and just think about it we are talking about the greatest battle ever fought that even in the camp of israel the king himself from the things he told he told david he was fighting against david oh you are just a youth in other words you are just a little boy this guy you see here has been fighting wars all his life you can't fight him can you imagine that praise be to god but he said no i am going to fight him anyhow and just listen to what david said when he was meeting goliath he said you are coming against me with your spears with your arrows with your shield with your whatever but i come against you in the name of the lord the god of the armies of the israel i mean israel whom you have defied praise be to god give god his glory let god know that you are depending on him the body is god's battle call him into action it is not yours why do you have to worry praise be to god call god on the scene he is always ready always looking for a man to use always to give for a woman to use and he is just waiting for you to step in and he will come there he is always ready are you always ready the god our lord is always ready it is not time for excuses anymore one of these days it will be over we've been talking about this for years ages we got up and we had them preaching about it we are talking about it christ studies will be dead and gone but look one of these days before you realize it will all be over check your walk with god examine yourself every single day there is nothing good out there is just to lure you and get you out of the program of god praise be to god check your work with god every single day a child of god you should not be satisfied with anything less than the world the greatest battle ever fought praise be to god we have a god who reigns our god is a fighter and the children of god are fighters we are called to fight for every day you are living you are fighting a battle one kind of the other that is why the devil always wants to tear our ranks apart if the devil can get us to disagree oh then we make the work too difficult god cannot even work with a group like that but when our strengths are united together our faith are united together and we come to the place and we take god at his word nothing will stop god from coming on the scene god does not deal with cows satan is a coward he is a coward the prophet of god said there are two words there are two powers the power of god and the power of satan and when you look at the power of satan it's a sign of weakness because a true sign of strength real strength picks people up but any power that draws people down is a sign of weakness and that is what the devil does to destroy everything that is of god to wreck your your work with god to destroy your testimony to smear you the devil is a coward if you have never seen a coward i'm telling you today that the devil satan our adversary that wicked one that old crook he is oh my goodness satan is wicked i mean a son or a daughter of god think of it how sweet how sweet it is to save god how sweet it is when you know god has come in praise be to god how sweet it is nothing satisfies thank you jesus why would any man or any woman in their right senses want to leave the kingdom of god for the filth that the devil is providing out there that demon power is a filthy spirit very filthy very deary when those legends of demons left their mind in gadara where did they go they entered the pits it can enter peaks it can enter snakes it can enter anything it's a filthy deadly spirit don't let thy evil spirit take a hold of your life you are bought and paid for by the precious blood of the lord jesus christ you belong to god thank you brother god bless you yes it looks like i'm losing a lot of water i can understand praise be to god pardon me tonight normally i'll put my phone off and leave it in the truck but i have it here with me [Music] because uh i needed to print a lot of stuff and for what reason um things didn't work out very well but i still have it here so i have a few here we'll be reading very shortly but if we contend if we can turn our bibles to ephesians 6 ephesians 6 10 to 17. we'll just take um we just take maybe the 10 verse i'm not very sure 10 to 17. finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places praise be to god now you can read the rest yes so we know that the captain of the army of the host of the army of the lord is in the midst of the camp but we are not called to go to bed to just go and sleep the bible here is telling us to put on the whole armor of god not just a part of it the whole ammo i think i would just have to read this so verse 14 stand therefore having your lines get about with truth and what is truth the word of god and having your breastplates of righteousness and your feet shut with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the short of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fairy dust of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the word and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praise be to god there is no way you can disregard the word of god and do god a favor if you sidestep the word or if you disobey the word of god i don't care what sacrifices you bring to god it stinks in the nose of god praise beauty god the best sacrifice you can ever give god is living by his word if you disobey the word of god i don't care what sacrifice you bring to god god is not honored in that right the word of god is the absolute taking god at his word it is the sword of the spirit we are we have a few things here we are going to read and you know as we've been trying to say the devil has been in this business longer than any of us here and the devil knows the word remember he quoted jesus the word he quoted him scripture when he said cast yourself and did by and and god will gave his angels charged to bear you up lest you dash your feet against the stone he was quoting him scripture but the difference between us and the devil is that he can't live by the word the world has taken on flesh in me and you that can never be said of the devil and the devil knows that now if the devil can get you we are talking about the word of god now when you take the word of god this is the word this is the word of god on print there is so much power in the world praise be to god sometimes we underrate ourselves and and in fact we don't do ourselves a favor i don't know where in america here but it was i think right here in america there was a car that caught fire and there was a bubble sitting on the dashboard the whole car consumed the fire consumed the whole car and left the bible sitting on the dashboard there is life in this world praise be to god now when you take the word of god there is there are two components here there is a part you see which is the word on print there is another part you don't see the bible says that the letter killeth by the spirit give up life so you know what it's a very dangerous situation if you take the letter and you leave out the spirit because that is what is going to transform your life we are not called to conform conforming to the word gives you a form of godliness it takes the power out of your life that you can come from jealousy to revelation and call the prophet in all your messages and yet there is no life so if the devil can get you to hang on the letter just hang on the letter he would have finished with you because the life

for yet another moment oh god that you can bring your sons and daughters together around your word of life to fists on your way tonight oh god you have never let us down you have never turned your back on us you've always been faithful oh my goodness if it hadn't been for you how would our lives be we thank you so much dear lord jesus that you gave your life for us you sacrificed your all you

line for nothing that we shall cut our way through with the sword of the spirit lord whenever the devil comes against us we will stay our grounds we don't care what it happens if it will cause us to lose our lives we'll do it with joy and gladness in our souls we just thank you so much oh god for being such a loving father that he took a thought of us before there was a world we thank you for your grace your amazing grace and your love for us which knows no bounds that you being god the one and only sovereign authority there is you humbled yourself even unto death that you come so low to pick us up from our rotiness and from our filth and have given us an identity to know that we are sons and daughters of god oh my goodness praise beauty your holy name to my lord we just thank you lord your worship and we bless you for everything you've done in jesus name [Music] god [Music] is [Music] appreciate the word tonight let's give the lord amen amen praise the lord you know we've been we've been taught you know by the prophet brother branham liking our age of this bright age told astronauts amen that's what he said in countdown so he taught us to count and we have to count properly in ephesians chapter 6 but dan read that you know many many in over the ages people we talk about the armor of god you know brother branham says the armor of god a supernatural so right there in ephesians chapter six paul lays seven armor he talks about truth he talks about righteousness you know we have to have truth we have to be able to tell the truth brother branham says even if they have to take it they have to take the height of our back we have to say it just like the way it was you know we we have to live a righteous life the gospel of peace what is the gospel of peace is the demonstration amen the life that we live is the gospel of peace we have to have faith you know we have to uh make our our salvation show and the word of god which is the saw but there is one other armor that comes invisible paul said prayed always that is the seven armor amen and if you notice right there in ephesians chapter 6 he never liking it to any ethnic substance because prayer is not an everything it cannot be lacking onto a helmet it cannot be lacking onto a belt because prayer is supernatural and that's why the prophet of god said we can never pray enough amen praise the lord so that is our seventh honor we have to keep there praise the lord and how can i overcome brother branham said then he says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his traits it's not to cram the bible in your head it's not to memorize scripture but it's to be able to recognize the devil in all of his traits amen a lot of people say there is there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there is a real devil he's just as real as you [Music] so we have to recognize him amen he says a real devil and you must recognize him real you have to recognize him real you have to say satan i know it's you praise the lord and you know like brother branham said i mean brother dan was saying satan is not in the picture quoting brother branham let me let me share this with you you always realize when you are taking a family picture or the picture with a friend [Music] is the guide that is not part of the picture he's the one that showed up because when you look at the picture he was not part of the picture so he always do a funny move and it turned out to be anybody look at the picture that's the first person to look at who is that person back there he was not part of the picture he just sneaked in and he wants to take over the show with some kind of a you know funny move or stupid move and that's what the devil does hey man unfortunately you can't hear the picture is you're going to destroy the memory praise the lord but you always have to recognize that guy that he's not part of the picture he just show up praise the lord amen so you must recognize him you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you praise the lord so we want to thank the lord you know brother dan was talking about that a fight in the devil i was reading i was really inspiring uh in my own bible studies and he and he took this scripture from ecclesiastes they came out very beautiful i want to share that with you also tonight he says uh eclipse i said nine four a living dog is better than a dead lion you know and the devil is a rolling lion so he's a dead lion praise the lord amen praise the lord so he says that he says life is a pressure thing and and in its humblious form life in his humblious form when i read this i want to listen to brother brennan message on life you know brother branham says in that message you know your loving kindness is better you know better than life he called it david there and i was just meditating on this life in its humblious form no matter what life throws to you amen it is superior than death praise the lord because there's no memory there is no repentance in the grave life in its humbliest form is better than death this truth is eminently setting in spiritual things no matter what level of your faith no matter what you're going through as long as you have life you have to know that life is given to you for you to fight and you got to make the best out of it don't no don't blame anybody as long as you have life where there is life there is hope that's what the guru's saying says he says in in spiritual things it is better to be least in the kingdom of heaven then the grit is out of it amen no matter what position you have in this life if it is not counted in god's kingdom forget about it the lowest degree of grace is superior to the anomalies development of a regenerated nature you see all the celebrity praise the lord man some of them they got to take in pills and pills and pills just to compose themselves for a thirty minutes act so they can be normal just to shoot at 10 minutes at the god of just take a lot of pills the lowest degree of grace that you have [Music] where the holy ghost implant divine life in the soul there is a precious deposit which none of the refinement of education can equal [Music] praise the lord brother branham said hebrew exposition you can check it out he says he says the baptising of the holy ghost has filled in for our education the baptising of the holy ghost in the soul of the believer has filled in for the knowledge of this world the thief on the cross excels caesar on his throne lazarus among the dogs is better than caesarea among the senators and the most unlittered christian is in the sight of god superior than palette amen then and plateau life i mean i was just i was just consumed by this tata and i just went just like i said when listening to brother branham message on life and and what what uh what a consolation no matter what life throw at you you have to think about it his loving kindness is better than life amen he's loving kindness just like that little ego that was the same way we in our mother woman we have to the battle started right there we had to fight our way out and since we came out it has been one battle from another thing about a little innocent child with sickness coughing fever there is fighting spirit in that child [Music] praise the lord there is no need to make excuses let's fight knowing that god is on our side [Music] praise the lord the greater bible ever fought there's a portion of the prayer meeting tonight i will ask brother one to come in and he had a little testimony when we finished the prayer it was just about time for the word so i had to cover the end up better one you come and just share your testimony before we pray [Music] hello i saw you mean [Music] you can't hear me you want to speak in this thing okay oh that's right i can thank you brother appreciate that um i was saying that um i last uh thursday morning i had three dreams and um there were all dreams i don't usually dream like that but you know when you're sometimes in prayer and you dedicate your life and you want god to work to you sometimes you know it's just he takes hold and he's the one who's in control and so thursday morning i i got up there were quick dreams that they were not too short and sunday as brother juan was speaking about the rebel revelations the six sixth chapter right nine that big five revelation yes revelation nine um he was talking about the angels holding yeah in the four wings of the earth holding all these things that are coming up coming toward us and and i i believe that they that in my heart i believe and i could be wrong but let like i said i've been saying this few days let every every man be a lie where did i and the word of god be the truth but i dreamed that that the first ring was that there was a storm coming it was just like it was all mixed it was just sand smoke everything and it was just covering the whole land and it's just as fast as it could come that was that was the first one the second was was the same dream again but after it was done it had destroyed houses everything that was it was destroyed the third dream was i was standing and i was looking down towards the valley in the two mountains in a valley in the middle of the valley all of a sudden it shook and it was just rolling you know how you seen sometimes in these video clips volcanoes the lava flowing it this was trees everything and there was a city in the middle of it it was just going into the ocean that was my dream and i just got off of it i sat inside of the bed and i just said why did i dream this i usually don't drink just like this so and here is brother latte preaching of the smoke and all the dust and all these things is coming upon the earth so to me it was just god vindicating his word i i believe that i believe we're entering into the book of revelation and last night i couldn't sleep i got up at two o'clock in the morning and i went back to go to sleep and i said don't go to sleep i was reading rebellion i found myself reading revelation again at three o'clock in the morning how god is taking care of his bride and watching over her thank you because all these things are coming upon us that there's no he has spoken it and there is no way that you can stop it it's coming what you have to do is prepare for it and look look for his coming okay look for him the scripture says look up your redemption is nigh so i just wanted to share that i shared with that last sunday when the brothers meeting when we were here i i couldn't contain myself i had to bring it out so and brother juan told me to share with the rest of you so just look up prepare yourself be in that bible daily be be reading looking for him make sure that he is in you living through you and that you know that that that brother brandon said one of the most powerful things in in us is love his love his love in us that's how we are going to overcome and so thank you for letting me come up here and just share this god bless each other [Music] praise the lord uh like brother once said he felt a little bit troubled of the dream and he he said he wanted to share it on sunday and he hesitated and then after the service you know then he mentioned it so i just thought that since he had the first burden to share it he should just share with us and we just want to thank the lord for that let's pray together heavenly father it was good being in your house tonight lord jesus father god and for us to be reminded that we are not in a picnic but we are on the battlefield we just pray that god you will help us lord you will strengthen us father lord you will give us
