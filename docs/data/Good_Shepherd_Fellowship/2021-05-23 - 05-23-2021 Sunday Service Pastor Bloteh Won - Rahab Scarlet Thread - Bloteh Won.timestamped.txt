[20:49] requests
[20:50] sorry testimony jesus mighty name
[20:56] about testimony from says country
[20:58] [Music]
[21:01] says katrin testimony
[21:17] um oh my goodness i'm so nervous um
[21:20] i'm gonna have my lung capacity right
[21:23] now
[21:23] um but
[21:27] okay so a lot of you know and some of
[21:29] you don't that
[21:30] in 2015 i was diagnosed with achalasia
[21:38] which is a disease of the
[21:41] of the esophagus so i have a hard time
[21:44] swallowing food and water
[21:48] anyway so i've dealt with that for a
[21:51] long time
[21:53] and in 2019 i was prayed for my brother
[21:57] ezekiel
[21:58] when he was here um and
[22:01] accepted my healing and then after
[22:05] after that we had a visiting minister
[22:09] and um i don't remember his name because
[22:11] i'm terrible with names
[22:13] but um he was talking about how
[22:16] he when he was believing for healing for
[22:18] himself he wrote
[22:20] on his um
[22:23] i think it was his mirror that
[22:26] by his stripes i was healed or something
[22:28] like that
[22:29] so then i put that on my phone so that
[22:31] every time i open my phone i have to see
[22:33] that
[22:35] and so then
[22:39] it's like things have gotten better
[22:41] slowly
[22:42] right away the fear and concern about it
[22:44] was gone for me
[22:46] um when i was prayed for and um
[22:49] but like healing is my my body is
[22:52] catching up to my faith
[22:54] i guess i would say um but
[22:57] the other day a couple weeks ago
[23:00] um i was eating i ate like an entire
[23:04] donut
[23:05] not a fluffy one it was a cake donut and
[23:08] then usually okay so usually when i'm
[23:10] eating i have to drink
[23:11] in between a couple of bites i have to
[23:13] drink sparkling water
[23:14] to push it down into my stomach
[23:17] otherwise it will just come back
[23:18] up and um so i ate an entire
[23:22] donut and then like
[23:25] didn't grab sparkling water which is
[23:27] usually my go-to
[23:29] um the thought came to me just drink
[23:31] regular water which is like
[23:34] before that would be a nightmare for me
[23:36] to just have
[23:37] i have a very um
[23:40] rough relationship with water um
[23:43] so i just i grabbed the the thought came
[23:46] to me just get
[23:47] the regular water so i did and it went
[23:50] down
[23:50] so that's my test 20.
[24:04] i want to bless god for our sister for
[24:06] that testimony
[24:08] in jesus mighty name we have another
[24:11] testimony from sis naomi

[24:26] want to thank you all for praying for my
[24:28] brother

[24:49] they have to open him up and
[24:50] it was his aorta was his diameter was

[44:32] the lord bless you you may have your
[44:33] seat praise the lord
[44:36] good to be in the house of the lord this
[44:38] morning what a place
[44:40] for us to be able to express express our
[44:43] gratitude to the lord
[44:45] for all his goodness and his mercy
[44:48] mercy to us us amen greet you all this
[44:51] morning in the name of the lord jesus

[45:02] lord for all the
[45:03] testimony all the prayers the songs
[45:06] signed this morning
[45:08] and we are so grateful for what the lord
[45:11] is doing
[45:13] in the life of his children amen praise
[45:16] the lord
[45:17] one of the one of the things they have
[45:21] affected
[45:22] modern christianity is the lack of
[45:27] answer to prayers and it's not because
[45:30] that god do not answer prayer is because
[45:33] people have shipped their mind
[45:35] to be able to design design how their
[45:38] prayers should be answered
[45:40] and because uh you know god don't work
[45:43] by him of mine
[45:45] and his thoughts are determined from the
[45:47] foundation of the world
[45:49] so even if he brings it to pass and they
[45:51] are not thinking about it that way
[45:54] and so then they believe that god is not
[45:56] answering their prayers but he said
[45:58] prayer answering god amen
[46:01] you either tell you you should wait on
[46:02] him or he says no
[46:05] or he says yes and all of those ones are
[46:08] answers as well
[46:10] praise the lord so we just want to thank
[46:13] the lord
[46:14] we want to thank the lord and be
[46:16] grateful to the lord this morning now
[46:18] uh early this morning uh a dear sister
[46:23] called me and she's not been feeling
[46:25] well
[46:26] and uh she just you know called me this
[46:30] morning because
[46:31] uh uh she kind of fulfilled that the
[46:35] lord
[46:36] you know witnessed to her uh you know
[46:39] of of his mercy
[46:42] and uh
[46:46] for some reason she's i mean she kind of
[46:49] her
[46:50] mistaking it over those are not
[46:52] overdosed but she took
[46:54] a pill that that had an ingredient that
[46:57] she's allergic to
[46:59] so it started increasing
[47:02] not only the back pains that she had but
[47:05] it was almost
[47:06] like suffocating her and because she was
[47:10] struggling with her breathing
[47:12] and so she said she woke up in the
[47:14] morning she prayed
[47:16] and just asked the lord to give her a uh
[47:20] give her sleep for her to be able to

[47:25] over a couple of days

[1:00:05] thank you
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:29] you know there was something that uh the
[1:00:32] lord
[1:00:34] been dealing with my hat on and uh
[1:00:38] wednesday night we closed the service
[1:00:41] and we were worshiping the little baby
[1:00:44] and what actually it is is that uh
[1:00:47] the other day we was preaching here and
[1:00:50] talking about
[1:00:53] what god can do through a praying mother
[1:00:55] or the praying wife than the man in the
[1:00:57] pulpit
[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:01:01] and i was we were reading what brother
[1:01:03] branham shared and and the holy spirit
[1:01:05] kind of struck my heart that morning
[1:01:10] it was not something that was on my note
[1:01:13] but then
[1:01:14] uh which of course is what the prophet
[1:01:16] of god said but it kind of
[1:01:18] uh became a revelation that morning
[1:01:22] that uh uh the virtue of the the power
[1:01:26] of the woman is in her virtue
[1:01:29] and the thought never leave left my mind
[1:01:31] since
[1:01:32] uh the lord kind of for there with my
[1:01:34] heart on there
[1:01:35] because there is a lot of there that is
[1:01:37] also applied to the church
[1:01:39] the power of the church is not in
[1:01:42] ramping the people it's not
[1:01:44] in making the people emotional no
[1:01:47] it's what god has already installed when
[1:01:50] we start to appreciate
[1:01:52] the sacrifice that god has given to us
[1:01:55] then power will start to come to the
[1:01:57] church
[1:01:58] now so as i was meditating on that
[1:02:01] uh the lord started dealing with my
[1:02:03] hiding
[1:02:04] you know and and just kind of for
[1:02:06] showing different things to me
[1:02:08] and you see in in the in the marriage
[1:02:11] covey then the bible says that the man
[1:02:14] you know must love his wife just like
[1:02:16] christ
[1:02:17] loved the church but if you realize it
[1:02:20] you will see that brother branham said
[1:02:21] in the church
[1:02:22] in the church ages he says that uh
[1:02:26] uh that uh the object you know of of
[1:02:29] god's
[1:02:30] love you know uh uh is his bride
[1:02:34] that we we are the object of his love
[1:02:37] the expression of his love but you see
[1:02:40] the thing about it there is that
[1:02:42] this great god that is that is so loving
[1:02:48] he is a very fountain of love
[1:02:52] but
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:02:58] being the fountain of love is so amazing
[1:03:01] sometimes
[1:03:02] it's so amazing in your mind you don't
[1:03:04] know how to say it
[1:03:06] that's how i feel being the fountain of
[1:03:09] love
[1:03:10] the lord bless you just sit down a
[1:03:11] little bit let's keep worshiping
[1:03:14] and uh being the fountain of love
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:19] god had to made us
[1:03:23] for us to love him
[1:03:27] praise the lord think about it this way
[1:03:30] and that's word many times we
[1:03:33] we uh we we misunderstand you know
[1:03:37] some of the things that god placed in
[1:03:39] his word
[1:03:40] you always hear people fuss about this
[1:03:44] it's uh you know the first and it says
[1:03:46] the other
[1:03:47] uh uh
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:51] you know uh most especially in carpool
[1:03:53] about you know the man which is the
[1:03:55] bible says
[1:03:56] the woman she referenced her husband and
[1:03:58] a woman
[1:03:59] says the bible says the man should love
[1:04:01] his wife now
[1:04:02] we have to realize that
[1:04:07] when it comes to
[1:04:11] the the lot of redemption just like we
[1:04:14] said
[1:04:15] you know showing from the word of god
[1:04:17] that god
[1:04:18] placed you know this law
[1:04:22] to govern the universe there is this law
[1:04:25] that he placed
[1:04:26] in the woman with the sacrifice that's
[1:04:29] the reason why he had to shut the
[1:04:31] heavens
[1:04:32] he had to shut the heavens the angels
[1:04:36] went
[1:04:36] quiet adam was in the deep sleep
[1:04:40] the animals didn't know anything of what
[1:04:43] god was doing
[1:04:44] when he took a rape from the side of
[1:04:47] adam to made a woman
[1:04:49] it was so dear to god because through
[1:04:52] that his attributes will be made
[1:04:54] known so he placed this thing in the
[1:04:57] woman
[1:04:58] they sacrifice you and
[1:05:01] uh
[1:05:05] and in in making her that way he made
[1:05:08] her a weaker vessel
[1:05:10] now when the fall came
[1:05:14] he gave the woman a promise of
[1:05:16] redemption the seed of the woman would
[1:05:18] bruise the head of the serpent
[1:05:20] so you see there are a lot of things
[1:05:21] that are playing out here
[1:05:23] and what i wanted to bring to you is
[1:05:25] that uh
[1:05:27] it's it's those things are installed in
[1:05:30] the woman just like it is in the church
[1:05:33] now the woman is the object the church
[1:05:37] is the object of his love even though
[1:05:40] he's the great
[1:05:41] fountain of love but if
[1:05:45] he have never allowed us to come into
[1:05:48] a worst take for him to be able to step
[1:05:52] out of his glory to come in and identify
[1:05:56] himself with us we would have never
[1:05:59] known what love is and
[1:06:01] and that portion of his attribute would
[1:06:03] have never been expressed
[1:06:05] so you see the thing about it did is the
[1:06:08] other
[1:06:09] the man christ jesus
[1:06:13] oh the man the husband is supposed to
[1:06:16] love his wife
[1:06:18] but you see the thing that is that
[1:06:21] emotion many times
[1:06:25] you know a man like i said love is an
[1:06:29] action word
[1:06:30] a man comes very short of having a true
[1:06:34] action and expression of love
[1:06:37] praise the lord just like how
[1:06:40] god make the church the expression
[1:06:44] or the object of his love and that is
[1:06:47] the same way
[1:06:49] he placed that thing in the woman now
[1:06:52] god so loved the word that's what the
[1:06:54] scripture says that he sent his only
[1:06:55] begotten son that whosoever believes in
[1:06:57] him
[1:06:58] should not perish you see god sent
[1:07:02] his son he expresses love but when you
[1:07:05] look at it it looks like it's cruel
[1:07:08] praise the lord the greater expression
[1:07:11] of love that he will come and pay for
[1:07:15] my sin and your sin but yet it was
[1:07:18] expressed in a cruel way
[1:07:22] are you grabbing the sense i'm saying
[1:07:24] praise the lord
[1:07:25] now you see like you says uh you say
[1:07:29] you you tell a man especially on a
[1:07:31] wedding day
[1:07:32] you say greet your greet your bride he
[1:07:35] stepped forward he lived for the villa
[1:07:37] he just kissed him
[1:07:40] praise the lord amen
[1:07:43] well if if it was the woman that was
[1:07:46] giving that privilege
[1:07:49] oh man she would lay her head on his
[1:07:52] shoulder
[1:07:55] what because it's in her
[1:07:58] it's in her are you understanding what
[1:08:00] i'm saying am i making sense to you
[1:08:02] it's in her praise the law
[1:08:06] so you see loving god in as much
[1:08:10] as he has loved us and has expressed his
[1:08:14] love by paying for
[1:08:16] our sin and our iniquity when it comes
[1:08:20] to the expression of love it takes a
[1:08:23] people
[1:08:24] whose hearts are touched whose lives are
[1:08:27] changed that we can be able to look back
[1:08:30] and see where the grace of god took us
[1:08:32] from
[1:08:33] and the things that he had done in our
[1:08:35] life
[1:08:36] praise the lord oh i mean loving god
[1:08:40] is worth it's not loving god in just a
[1:08:44] word or a statement i love you
[1:08:46] the church has the truth expression of
[1:08:49] love
[1:08:50] we know how to lift our hands we know
[1:08:52] how to worship him
[1:08:54] we know how to lay our head on his chest
[1:08:57] and we can cry and we can praise god i
[1:09:01] mean that's what i'm talking about
[1:09:02] making love with god
[1:09:04] you have a church today that says lord
[1:09:06] jesus i love you that's all we know how
[1:09:08] to say i love you
[1:09:09] we don't have we don't have deep
[1:09:11] expression
[1:09:15] we don't have half that expression
[1:09:20] we can sing praise god and we're not
[1:09:22] even praising god in our minds
[1:09:25] we are just singing it because the music
[1:09:27] is playing
[1:09:28] and we are thinking about something
[1:09:30] completely different
[1:09:36] praise the lord amen
[1:09:40] oh i'm telling you it's in the woman she
[1:09:42] knows how to make love more than the man
[1:09:46] praise the lord so you see the mystery
[1:09:48] there is that
[1:09:50] the man is commanded to love his wife
[1:09:53] but the mystery there is that love is in
[1:09:56] a woman for her to teach her husband
[1:10:00] that is the mystery
[1:10:04] she's supposed to bring him to that
[1:10:06] place
[1:10:07] but the problem there is that there is a
[1:10:10] commandment
[1:10:11] man love your wife so what what
[1:10:14] happening there is that the woman stayed
[1:10:16] back
[1:10:17] and she said but the bible said you
[1:10:19] should love me the love that i should
[1:10:21] give you
[1:10:21] is in you
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:26] oh my goodness
[1:10:30] the great fountain of love the god that
[1:10:34] loved the whole world
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:38] that's what a new birth is
[1:10:41] praise the lord this great internal
[1:10:43] spirit
[1:10:44] he's been there all this why he don't
[1:10:46] know how to love himself
[1:10:48] [Music]
[1:10:50] but he redeemed a people and pulled them
[1:10:53] to himself
[1:10:55] and put his love in their heart so you
[1:10:58] can love him for god to feel
[1:11:01] his love it has to come from you
[1:11:17] praise the lord
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:29] listen to our faith let's sing their
[1:11:32] chorus again and then we will turn to
[1:11:34] the preaching of the word
[1:11:37] praise god praise god praise god
[1:11:43] i thank you lord
[1:11:46] i praise you lord i love you

[1:12:52] [Music]
[1:13:03] praise god praise god
[1:13:08] praise god
[1:13:16] it's also like the scripture says a
[1:13:18] woman must reference a husband
[1:13:21] if almighty god did not humble himself
[1:13:24] down
[1:13:25] if he did not humble himself from his
[1:13:27] glory
[1:13:28] there is no way we could reference him
[1:13:32] praise the lord there is no way we could
[1:13:35] reference him
[1:13:37] it's the way that god became one of us
[1:13:42] to bring us to the place where
[1:13:46] we are him
[1:13:47] [Music]
[1:13:49] praise the lord
[1:13:53] take his man pharaoh that's why brother
[1:13:54] branham says the man must live such a
[1:13:57] life before his wife

[1:19:05] it was an accident or maybe uh an
[1:19:08] adoption
[1:19:09] you know uh someone adopted a child
[1:19:12] uh uh you know a story like that and it
[1:19:14] just move your heart
[1:19:16] and sometimes it move your heart and
[1:19:18] move you to tears
[1:19:20] now you you would just think that uh
[1:19:22] sometimes it's just a story that you
[1:19:25] have read
[1:19:26] but if you are uh one that is
[1:19:29] that is sensitive to the holy spirit
[1:19:31] dealing with you
[1:19:32] you will see how god will use that
[1:19:36] story and he will start to show you
[1:19:39] things
[1:19:39] in your own life praise the lord
[1:19:43] amen and sometimes you will move it from
[1:19:46] the natural to the spiritual
[1:19:49] you you realize that just by hearing
[1:19:53] those things
[1:19:54] she's making it general we heard about
[1:19:56] it our heart moved because everybody was
[1:19:58] talking about it the generals were
[1:20:00] talking about it
[1:20:01] it came on the news in one sense she was
[1:20:04] expressing
[1:20:05] that we have such a fear
[1:20:09] but we know because
[1:20:13] she was an illet god was using those
[1:20:18] story to prepare her heart
[1:20:22] because she was an illeg what was
[1:20:26] on the news what was in the newspaper
[1:20:28] whatever they said about
[1:20:30] israel drying up the red sea overcoming
[1:20:33] the kings of amara god was using that
[1:20:37] to wave down to that predestinated seed
[1:20:40] in her spirit
[1:20:44] because as soon as she saw those men
[1:20:46] yeah this was a man
[1:20:50] a connection started coming that she
[1:20:52] could not put together
[1:20:55] she could not put together she just
[1:20:57] thought well
[1:20:58] what we have heard we are afraid you
[1:21:00] know these guys overcome the other
[1:21:02] nation they're my overcomers
[1:21:03] she's looking at that in the sense of
[1:21:06] a kind of fear but it is a reference
[1:21:10] fear that god starts to quicken
[1:21:14] in her heart
[1:21:19] are we together
[1:21:22] the way that god we convict a man
[1:21:26] is only in his design
[1:21:29] only god knows what he will use
[1:21:35] to change a man is owned to his design
[1:21:39] we can have our church doctrine we can
[1:21:42] have our church rules
[1:21:43] we can have our regulation god don't
[1:21:46] need it
[1:21:49] you keep it it's good for you
[1:21:53] but he don't need it
[1:21:57] he can use the singing of a song
[1:22:01] praise the lord he can use the
[1:22:03] appearance
[1:22:05] the order of a people in church
[1:22:09] if someone can say wow god is in that
[1:22:12] place
[1:22:14] what god will use
[1:22:19] to get a man is only his design
[1:22:25] praise the lord and that's the reason
[1:22:26] why we don't preach to impress anybody
[1:22:29] amen because it's all in his design
[1:22:35] as soon as we heard these things our
[1:22:38] heart did melt
[1:22:41] praise the lord
[1:22:45] neither did there remain
[1:22:48] animal courage in any man because of you
[1:22:52] all over the street people were talking
[1:22:55] about it
[1:22:57] we saw some of our military even
[1:22:59] resigning from the army
[1:23:02] when he heard how can you fight an army
[1:23:06] that opened the red sea
[1:23:08] how can you fight him
[1:23:12] praise the lord
[1:23:17] this we we shoot our satellite to see
[1:23:19] what kind of
[1:23:20] ammunition they have they don't have
[1:23:21] ammunition but they are overcoming kings
[1:23:28] the police department down the road just
[1:23:32] closed because every one of them
[1:23:35] ran to their village
[1:23:41] i'm bringing you breaking news
[1:23:45] i'm bringing you breaking news amen
[1:23:49] it's rahab testified for the lord your
[1:23:53] god
[1:23:57] he is god yeah you think about it
[1:24:00] great testimony but look at the life of
[1:24:03] this woman
[1:24:06] she's holding those things in her heart
[1:24:10] and she just slept with a man last night
[1:24:12] that was not her husband
[1:24:15] it was two or three men she slept with
[1:24:18] but she's holding in her heart
[1:24:20] and she's testifying with her lips
[1:24:24] something that we we are we are nervous
[1:24:26] to do
[1:24:33] praise the lord oh i like when the lord
[1:24:36] does things like this
[1:24:38] amen is god in heaven above in the air
[1:24:41] beneath
[1:24:42] now therefore i pray you swear unto me
[1:24:46] by the lord since i have shown you
[1:24:50] kindness
[1:24:52] that year will also show kindness
[1:24:55] unto my father's house
[1:24:59] and give me a true token
[1:25:05] praise the lord
[1:25:08] and that year will save you will save a
[1:25:11] life
[1:25:12] my father my mother my brethren is my
[1:25:15] sisters
[1:25:17] and all that they have
[1:25:21] and deliver our lives from death
[1:25:26] and the man answered her
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:29] our life for yours
[1:25:34] greater love no greater love love no man
[1:25:37] jesus said
[1:25:38] than for one man to lay down his life
[1:25:42] for another but this time it was a woman
[1:25:46] that was laying down her life
[1:25:50] for them a type
[1:25:54] of the sacrificial love
[1:25:58] just as how christ laid down his life he
[1:26:00] will get a redeemed people call his
[1:26:02] bride
[1:26:03] that will be able to lay down their life
[1:26:10] in prayer and supplication
[1:26:16] in seeing others better than ourselves
[1:26:20] we will lay down our life for others
[1:26:26] our life for yours
[1:26:29] you know what that means a whole army
[1:26:32] coming
[1:26:33] against these people that's capital
[1:26:36] punishment for rahab
[1:26:40] praise the lord for her to be
[1:26:43] able to launch spies
[1:26:51] they were going to grab her grab her
[1:26:53] father house
[1:26:55] everyone that is associated with her
[1:27:00] they're going to kill them
[1:27:05] so this is not this is not cheap
[1:27:07] business
[1:27:09] this is a very expensive business
[1:27:13] a business world you are putting your
[1:27:15] life on the line
[1:27:20] it's a very expensive business
[1:27:25] this is not a cheap business
[1:27:30] and the man answered her our life for
[1:27:33] yours
[1:27:34] if if you
[1:27:38] alternet this our business
[1:27:41] and it shall be when the lord have given
[1:27:45] us the land
[1:27:46] that we will deal kindly and truly with
[1:27:49] thee
[1:27:51] then she let them down by a call
[1:27:55] through the window of a house
[1:27:59] for her house was upon the town wall
[1:28:04] and she dwarfed upon the wall
[1:28:07] now living upon the wall of the city
[1:28:10] was a very expensive place
[1:28:14] it was almost like buying the house by
[1:28:17] the lake
[1:28:20] praise the lord so you can see
[1:28:28] something is making me to sneeze here
[1:28:32] praise the lord are we together
[1:28:37] amen so you can see
[1:28:40] that this was just not a woman
[1:28:44] this was a woman that could have just
[1:28:47] continued her lifestyle
[1:28:51] because she was doing well to buy a
[1:28:54] house
[1:28:55] on the walls of the city
[1:28:59] it's not a ghetto
[1:29:03] because every house on the wall of the
[1:29:05] city
[1:29:06] represent the city
[1:29:10] it represent the beauty of the city
[1:29:16] so this was not a broken home
[1:29:23] this was a woman that was doing very
[1:29:26] well
[1:29:26] she had expensive things in her home
[1:29:30] because she was living an expensive life
[1:29:38] are we together
[1:29:41] and she said unto them giving to the
[1:29:44] mountains this is what i want for us to
[1:29:46] pay attention to now
[1:29:48] get into the mountains please the
[1:29:50] pursuer meets you
[1:29:52] and hide yourself there three
[1:29:55] days three
[1:29:58] days on the line that word three
[1:30:02] days oh praise the lord
[1:30:06] what almighty god we serve amen
[1:30:10] three days you notice that in the bible
[1:30:14] genesis the third day is the day of life
[1:30:19] amen genesis chapter one the third day
[1:30:22] is the day of life
[1:30:24] and because of that the jews
[1:30:27] always do their wedding
[1:30:31] on the tv because they believe there is
[1:30:34] a day of life
[1:30:36] the marriage in canada was on the teddy
[1:30:43] praise the lord
[1:30:47] no one of jesus rose on the tear day
[1:30:50] because it's the day of life but let's
[1:30:53] keep with this
[1:30:55] until the pursuit be returned
[1:30:59] and afterwards ye
[1:31:04] afterward may you go your way and the
[1:31:07] man said unto her
[1:31:09] we will be blameless of this
[1:31:13] thine odds which thou have made us to
[1:31:15] swear
[1:31:19] behold when we come into the land
[1:31:23] thou shalt bound
[1:31:27] this line of scarlet thread
[1:31:31] in the window
[1:31:34] which thou has let us down
[1:31:37] by you understanding the language there
[1:31:42] now wish they have let us from
[1:31:46] which they have let us down bar
[1:31:51] the very same trade
[1:31:54] you let us down with
[1:31:59] that's why you should hang to your
[1:32:00] window
[1:32:04] are we together
[1:32:08] the same thing that saved him
[1:32:11] would be the same thing that would save
[1:32:13] her
[1:32:14] [Laughter]
[1:32:17] oh my goodness the same thing that saved
[1:32:20] him
[1:32:23] will be the same thing
[1:32:26] oh my goodness oh my goodness
[1:32:30] that's the reason why peter said unto
[1:32:32] the philippian
[1:32:33] jailer believe the lord jesus christ
[1:32:37] ye in your household shall be saved
[1:32:42] praise the lord amen brother branham
[1:32:45] says the same faith that save you
[1:32:47] will be the same faith that will save
[1:32:49] your household if you can just keep it
[1:32:52] together
[1:32:55] glory be to god it was met
[1:32:59] it was not uh uh the the
[1:33:02] the the spies giving her
[1:33:08] a rope she provided
[1:33:14] that was her fate she provided
[1:33:22] praise the lord oh my goodness
[1:33:25] are we together
[1:33:28] i'm telling you i don't like i encourage
[1:33:32] you young people
[1:33:34] you can never understand appreciate
[1:33:38] this message of the hour until you learn
[1:33:41] to read your bible
[1:33:45] sometimes we think that we need to know
[1:33:47] the message for us to understand our
[1:33:49] bible you get it wrong
[1:33:52] when you when you read your bible the
[1:33:54] message
[1:33:55] will start coming out
[1:33:57] [Laughter]
[1:33:58] because the prophet took the message
[1:34:00] right from the bible
[1:34:02] praise the lord oh my goodness me
[1:34:07] whoa this is a good bible study
[1:34:12] let's read our bible first then we will
[1:34:14] preach
[1:34:16] amen my my mind behold when we come into
[1:34:20] the land
[1:34:21] thou shalt bound this line of scholar
[1:34:23] trade
[1:34:25] in the window which thou did let us down
[1:34:29] bound
[1:34:31] and thou shall bring their father and
[1:34:33] our mother and our brethrens and all the
[1:34:36] the father's house father household
[1:34:40] home on today and it shall be
[1:34:44] that whosoever shall go out
[1:34:47] of the doors of that house into the
[1:34:50] street his blood shall be upon his own
[1:34:52] head
[1:34:54] and we shall be guiltless amen
[1:34:57] now so this also shows us that it was
[1:35:00] not only rahab that was safe
[1:35:03] praise the lord it was not only rahab it
[1:35:06] was as many that was in rahab house
[1:35:09] that was safe so there were many people
[1:35:12] that were saved in rehab house that new
[1:35:15] rehab about the life that she lived
[1:35:20] praise the lord so as rahab was going
[1:35:24] to to to to the camera of ezra they went
[1:35:27] with her
[1:35:32] oh there were many of them that went
[1:35:35] with rahab
[1:35:36] now that they're not a proof of the life
[1:35:37] that she's lit that she left
[1:35:39] which of course i don't think there is
[1:35:41] something that we should approve of
[1:35:44] but sometimes you have to understand
[1:35:47] you have to
[1:35:51] you have to think behind the action of
[1:35:54] the person
[1:35:57] and says what put them in that life
[1:36:06] no little girl grow up from being smart
[1:36:08] and thinking her mind
[1:36:10] i want to be a prostitute
[1:36:14] no young man growing up thinks that i
[1:36:16] want to i just want to live on drugs
[1:36:28] glory be to god amen
[1:36:34] so this morning we want to talk on rahab
[1:36:37] scholar trade
[1:36:40] rehab scholar trade that's what we want
[1:36:42] to talk about
[1:36:43] this morning now the thing that is
[1:36:46] bringing me to this subject is that uh
[1:36:48] i was you know reading and studying
[1:36:52] and something here that that uh
[1:36:55] i've i've looked over over the years
[1:36:58] i've not been able to put it together
[1:37:01] uh i mean put all the pieces together
[1:37:04] and one of them was uh
[1:37:07] i think one of the brothers if i can
[1:37:09] remember i don't know whether it was
[1:37:11] brother stephen wolf's or brother
[1:37:13] brother ariel one time we were talking
[1:37:15] and asked me
[1:37:16] about uh the the three days and three
[1:37:20] nights
[1:37:22] jesus said as as jonah spent three days
[1:37:26] and three nights in the ballet of the
[1:37:28] world the son of man
[1:37:30] was spent three days and three nights in
[1:37:32] the heart of the earth
[1:37:34] praise the lord amen
[1:37:37] now
[1:37:40] so
[1:37:44] look at this in the scripture
[1:37:47] jonah jesus said that
[1:37:52] david also said his holy one shall not
[1:37:55] see
[1:37:56] corruption
[1:38:00] praise the lord amen so
[1:38:04] we know that
[1:38:07] 72 hours was not going to break upon him
[1:38:13] are we together because after seven or
[1:38:16] two
[1:38:16] hours corruption set into the body
[1:38:21] and you see that is the reason why uh uh
[1:38:24] when we when we when we when we leave
[1:38:27] this body
[1:38:28] we step right into our tear funding body
[1:38:32] so that that that promise of not seeing
[1:38:35] corruption was not only to to our lord
[1:38:38] jesus
[1:38:39] he brought immortality in view but it's
[1:38:42] also to the believers
[1:38:44] amen because we all come under he's the
[1:38:48] first bond of many brethren
[1:38:49] we all come under that promise that the
[1:38:52] holy one will now see corruption
[1:38:56] so as soon as we step out of this body
[1:38:58] we step into a new body
[1:39:00] we don't see corruption amen
[1:39:04] are we together amen
[1:39:07] and uh so uh uh
[1:39:11] but if you if you look at the two
[1:39:14] prophecy there
[1:39:17] jonah is spending three days in a wheel
[1:39:20] belly
[1:39:21] and uh uh uh and david saying
[1:39:25] uh uh the holy one will now see
[1:39:28] corruption
[1:39:29] you realize that you know christ must
[1:39:32] come out
[1:39:33] before 72 hours praise the lord
[1:39:37] and the scripture prove it because jesus
[1:39:41] gave
[1:39:41] up the ghost in the evening time
[1:39:45] amen and then
[1:39:48] early the resurrection morning
[1:39:52] he came off the grave so
[1:39:55] 72 hours did not clock over his body
[1:39:59] are we settled with that but a cross
[1:40:03] over it had to be at three days
[1:40:07] just like how it was for juna
[1:40:12] are we together but you will realize
[1:40:16] that's one of the things that drew my
[1:40:17] mind to this scripture
[1:40:19] that you will realize that the principle
[1:40:23] of three days
[1:40:24] and three nights
[1:40:28] has been played out in the scripture
[1:40:30] even before jonah
[1:40:35] jonah and alone did not hold the
[1:40:38] mistreat of three days and three nights
[1:40:43] no the first person that held the
[1:40:46] mystery of three days and three nights
[1:40:49] was abraham
[1:40:55] praise the lord god spoke to abraham
[1:40:58] for him to go and and and prove his love
[1:41:01] to god
[1:41:03] by sacrificing isaac
[1:41:06] amen is that what the scripture says
[1:41:10] are we together
[1:41:14] are you sitting out there and saying
[1:41:15] what is brother one cooking
[1:41:18] whatever i'm cooking you're going to eat
[1:41:20] it
[1:41:21] a guy can promise you it's good
[1:41:23] [Laughter]
[1:41:25] by the help of the lord
[1:41:28] i know you sit in there and say what is
[1:41:30] he cooking this morning
[1:41:32] praise the lord we don't cook anything
[1:41:34] we just want
[1:41:36] what has already been cooked
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:43] amen god spoke to abraham
[1:41:47] and the scripture says they had to go
[1:41:51] at three days journey
[1:41:56] is that what the bible said they had to
[1:41:58] go at three days
[1:42:00] journey
[1:42:04] and when he got to the mountain abraham
[1:42:07] told his seven
[1:42:09] you wait for us here the lady myself
[1:42:11] will go up
[1:42:13] and make a sacrifice
[1:42:16] praise the lord now when god spoke to
[1:42:20] abraham
[1:42:22] god told abraham to kill his son
[1:42:27] to sacrifice his son
[1:42:30] kill sounds a little bit violent
[1:42:34] but to sacrifice his son but the truth
[1:42:37] of the matter yet is dead
[1:42:40] in as much as god told abraham
[1:42:43] in ibrahim isaac
[1:42:46] was already dead
[1:42:53] because he obeyed the lord
[1:42:59] so isaac was already dead
[1:43:06] he never told sarah nothing about it
[1:43:10] and he went three days
[1:43:15] and on the tv that was when they got
[1:43:19] up on top of the mountain
[1:43:23] praise the lord amen
[1:43:27] if abraham
[1:43:31] sacrificing isaac on top of the mountain
[1:43:34] was a type of crimes
[1:43:38] then you can see this now only because
[1:43:40] if
[1:43:41] when jesus went on on on top of the
[1:43:44] mountain
[1:43:45] he had to die
[1:43:48] but up on top of the mountain there
[1:43:50] isaac never die
[1:43:52] why because he has already completed his
[1:43:54] three days
[1:44:01] and abraham told isaac i have received
[1:44:04] you
[1:44:05] as one from the dead
[1:44:10] is that why he said to isaac i have
[1:44:13] received you
[1:44:14] as one from the dead
[1:44:21] so you can see it in time abraham and
[1:44:24] isaac
[1:44:25] had a three days journey and it was all
[1:44:29] pointing to calvary
[1:44:32] and isaac got his resurrection when
[1:44:35] angel
[1:44:36] held the hands of abraham he lied down
[1:44:41] on the altar and he woke up on the altar
[1:44:50] oh glory be to god praise the lord
[1:44:56] oh my god now so you will see
[1:45:00] that there has been this thing
[1:45:04] and uh uh let let me take few things
[1:45:06] here brother branham share quickly
[1:45:08] created of sin the prophet of god said
[1:45:10] today i was thinking
[1:45:12] of the cathedral a ringing out
[1:45:16] and a bell stored in and sofa like that
[1:45:18] and people going to
[1:45:20] to the church and making ready and the
[1:45:23] women buying their easter huts and so
[1:45:25] forth
[1:45:26] what has this come to
[1:45:29] mine how i can
[1:45:32] understand where a rabbit hat
[1:45:36] where a rabbit has anything to do
[1:45:39] with the resurrection praise the lord
[1:45:44] in another message brother bam says even
[1:45:46] the rabbit was not an accepted animal
[1:45:50] under the old testament
[1:45:56] how has it become part of the church
[1:45:58] easter eggs and all of these things
[1:46:06] easter hearts and easter flowers and all
[1:46:08] of these things he said how has it
[1:46:10] become
[1:46:11] how how how did we get down here
[1:46:15] because the very beginning of these
[1:46:18] things
[1:46:18] were pagan washing that were introduced
[1:46:22] to the church
[1:46:25] from the roman church that's the reason
[1:46:28] why every year
[1:46:30] easter has to fall on the roman catalyte
[1:46:33] length
[1:46:34] season whatever room decide
[1:46:37] is the allen season that's when it
[1:46:40] become
[1:46:41] our easter
[1:46:48] praise the lord so you see how
[1:46:52] how a
[1:46:57] idolatry is always trying to move
[1:47:01] parallel with the scripture
[1:47:05] it comes so close that if possible
[1:47:09] the ilit will be deceived
[1:47:12] and how we have been deceived to believe
[1:47:16] that jesus died
[1:47:17] on friday
[1:47:21] good friday it is not proven right
[1:47:25] but the roman catholic church gave it to
[1:47:27] us we swallow
[1:47:29] it we believe it
[1:47:36] and it's good fridays it's good friday
[1:47:40] glory be to god
[1:47:45] hallelujah amen
[1:47:50] now you have to realize that
[1:47:53] the easter it is something that was that
[1:47:57] is captain
[1:47:58] uh uh uh that is uh copy after
[1:48:02] the jewish passover
[1:48:05] when god told ezra that this will begin
[1:48:08] the beginning of months
[1:48:12] praise the lord amen bringing his people
[1:48:16] out of the land of egypt
[1:48:21] now you see let me let me correct this
[1:48:23] before you think that i'm trying to
[1:48:25] establish something in your mind
[1:48:28] just as how christmas is wrong that's
[1:48:30] how easter is wrong
[1:48:32] it's all being given to the christian
[1:48:35] church by the roman catholic church
[1:48:37] and it's all the other worship the
[1:48:40] reason why
[1:48:43] we participate is not for the evening
[1:48:47] it's for the person
[1:48:51] we try to bring the true meaning of the
[1:48:54] person
[1:48:55] christ jesus and now the tradition and
[1:48:59] not the dates
[1:49:01] right because some people become so
[1:49:06] uh uh uh uh you know they they become oh
[1:49:09] yeah is wrong i mean it's completely
[1:49:11] wrong christmas is wrong nothing
[1:49:13] you know that that is not truth
[1:49:17] but if that is not true it's chris
[1:49:19] christmas is wrong that is not true
[1:49:21] it's either there was no christ that was
[1:49:24] born
[1:49:25] all you have to find the truth date that
[1:49:28] he was born
[1:49:30] praise the lord now so i would rather
[1:49:34] stand for the fact that christ was born
[1:49:39] he was a gift that god gave to the world
[1:49:42] praise the lord whatever day you want to
[1:49:45] take you want to carry it to january 1st
[1:49:46] i will be right there with you
[1:49:49] to tell you i believe that christ is the
[1:49:51] gift of god to the word
[1:49:54] praise the lord that's what matters the
[1:49:56] person
[1:49:59] but the world is so caught up in the
[1:50:01] evenings and the commercial world has
[1:50:04] taken over it
[1:50:07] they make dresses for christmas and
[1:50:08] flower for christmas
[1:50:10] and trees for christmas
[1:50:13] and everything for christmas and that is
[1:50:17] the thing that people
[1:50:18] buy to believe that they are saving
[1:50:21] christmas
[1:50:22] or celebrating christmas but brother
[1:50:25] branham said christmas
[1:50:26] to the believer it's a time of worship
[1:50:29] he's for the matter of fact he said why
[1:50:31] should it be only one day
[1:50:33] when god gave us such a great gift we
[1:50:35] must be able to have christmas every day
[1:50:37] of our life
[1:50:38] when you think about the gift of god
[1:50:42] christmas must be every day of your life
[1:50:47] amen
[1:50:51] praise the lord
[1:50:54] but we get caught up in all
[1:50:58] the actions and uh the things in
[1:51:02] what of you glory be to god now see
[1:51:05] where i'm going now
[1:51:06] the reason why i'm driving into this
[1:51:08] thing so this the same thing with easter
[1:51:11] he says i can't understand where a
[1:51:14] rabbit has anything to do with the
[1:51:16] resurrection see
[1:51:18] how a christmas tree has anything to do
[1:51:20] with the birth of christ
[1:51:22] is pagan friends
[1:51:26] we have got off the path somewhere
[1:51:30] that's right
[1:51:33] but now a real born-again man
[1:51:37] or woman realized because
[1:51:40] there's life within you tells
[1:51:43] you that's wrong
[1:51:48] christ's life within you tells you
[1:51:52] that when christmas come in all the
[1:51:54] christmas party
[1:51:56] how can we celebrate the party of the
[1:51:58] holy one
[1:51:59] being drunk
[1:52:06] his life within you tells you there is
[1:52:09] something wrong with that
[1:52:14] glory be to god so we go here
[1:52:17] and uh uh i mean we can we can travel on
[1:52:20] with this
[1:52:22] you know and just and just go on run
[1:52:25] down the race track here he says uh
[1:52:27] sad we will see jesus so this great
[1:52:30] feast
[1:52:31] that we are approaching here now you
[1:52:33] know
[1:52:34] in this season this this lengthening
[1:52:38] as they caught it and approaching good
[1:52:42] friday a week
[1:52:46] is the easter i believe and then i just
[1:52:50] i just dropped this in just because
[1:52:52] brother branham identified that with the
[1:52:54] length seizing
[1:52:56] so that's that's how our christmas is
[1:52:59] determined
[1:53:01] when rome has determined when should be
[1:53:03] length
[1:53:08] praise the lord
[1:53:11] now so so we see here
[1:53:15] but it's beautiful when you look in the
[1:53:16] scripture
[1:53:18] it's beautiful when you look in the
[1:53:20] scripture
[1:53:21] and you take a very close walk on this
[1:53:24] subject
[1:53:26] you take a very close walk and you ask
[1:53:30] yourself
[1:53:32] how is this praise the lord
[1:53:35] the scripture identified it was the
[1:53:38] first date of the week
[1:53:43] early that morning mary magdalene
[1:53:48] praise the lord went over now you have
[1:53:52] to you have to also recognize here
[1:53:55] that uh uh
[1:53:58] they will stay in one form stay honor
[1:54:02] judaism
[1:54:02] the birth of the church has not come
[1:54:04] until pentecost
[1:54:07] so they were still meeting
[1:54:10] and respecting their sabbath
[1:54:13] praise the lord i mean so if
[1:54:16] it was sabbah mayor magdalene wouldn't
[1:54:18] have gone off of her house
[1:54:22] that's right praise the lord
[1:54:26] so we we see that i'm just trying to
[1:54:28] pull some things here into
[1:54:30] into uh
[1:54:34] so you can be able to understand that
[1:54:37] so let's look at
[1:54:41] having a few scriptures that i wrote
[1:54:43] down here studying on this
[1:54:45] let's look at uh saint john chapter 12.
[1:54:53] let's look as in john chapter 12. sorry
[1:54:55] i'm not i'm not making you excited this
[1:54:58] morning
[1:54:59] praise the lord amen
[1:55:14] sin john chapter 12 you just look at the
[1:55:16] first verse the bible says
[1:55:18] then jesus six days
[1:55:22] before the passover
[1:55:25] came to bethany where lazarus
[1:55:30] was which has been dead whom he has
[1:55:33] raised from the dead
[1:55:34] and it was there a better name where
[1:55:38] merit anointed him
[1:55:41] for his death and burial
[1:55:44] so six days before the passover
[1:55:49] praise the lord now so if it was on a
[1:55:52] friday
[1:55:54] and you want to count six days back you
[1:55:56] will have to fall
[1:55:58] on the sabbath amen
[1:56:02] am i right
[1:56:06] glory be to god
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:15] now so if you watch that in the
[1:56:17] scripture
[1:56:18] you will also see when you get over to
[1:56:21] verse 12
[1:56:22] of the same chapter the bible says on
[1:56:26] the next day most people would come to
[1:56:30] the feast
[1:56:31] when they heard jesus was coming to to
[1:56:34] jerusalem took branches
[1:56:36] that was when he drove
[1:56:40] into jerusalem
[1:56:43] singing hosanna blessed is he that
[1:56:46] cometh in the name of the lord
[1:56:49] amen now one of the things that is
[1:56:52] attached to that prophecy
[1:56:55] is there as jesus was going through
[1:56:59] jerusalem he was being examined by the
[1:57:03] people
[1:57:04] because the lamb had to be examined for
[1:57:07] four days
[1:57:13] so he was examined by the people he was
[1:57:16] examined by the church
[1:57:17] he was examined by the government
[1:57:21] amen and they found no fault
[1:57:24] [Laughter]
[1:57:30] oh glory be to god
[1:57:33] oh man
[1:57:36] it looks like i'm just in myself this
[1:57:38] morning i'm in my elements
[1:57:42] somebody got to get me out
[1:57:45] praise the lord amen
[1:57:50] glory be to god now so
[1:57:53] when you when you put this together and
[1:57:56] uh
[1:57:57] and and and and uh and the sacrifice
[1:58:03] how to be killed
[1:58:06] on the 14th day of nissan
[1:58:10] praise the lord it had to be killed on
[1:58:14] the 14th day
[1:58:16] the sacrifice had to be presented on the
[1:58:18] 10th day
[1:58:20] amen praise the lord and then it must be
[1:58:24] a zombie
[1:58:25] because 10 is the number of of election
[1:58:30] am i right oh yes in the scripture
[1:58:35] praise the lord amen
[1:58:39] so that the sacrifice how to be a zombie
[1:58:44] for four veins
[1:58:50] the priests had to look at the sacrifice
[1:58:53] up and down you
[1:58:54] you read that in in leviticus you see
[1:58:56] that
[1:58:57] and so so you see here
[1:59:01] it kind of it it throw this off
[1:59:14] and throw this off and and there and
[1:59:16] there are there there are a few other
[1:59:18] things that
[1:59:18] that we can look at there but i'm just
[1:59:21] i'm just putting it
[1:59:23] there so you can look at the scriptures
[1:59:24] and there are different other scriptures
[1:59:26] also you can look at
[1:59:27] in in the in the bible and uh i have
[1:59:31] them all written down you but
[1:59:32] i mean it's going to take me into a real
[1:59:34] bible study this morning to be
[1:59:36] able to cover that place but we already
[1:59:40] know
[1:59:41] you know by history and in the prophet
[1:59:44] of god letting us know that's a pagan
[1:59:46] feast
[1:59:47] so we have to bring the truth meaning
[1:59:50] out of christmas
[1:59:53] we have to bring the truth meaning out
[1:59:55] of easter
[1:59:57] amen because if you don't if you don't
[2:00:00] have the true meaning you are just you
[2:00:02] are just into a pig and wash it
[2:00:05] amen praise the lord
[2:00:10] see what the church nominee will do
[2:00:14] jesus coming going through
[2:00:17] jerusalem it's called palm sunday praise
[2:00:20] the lord
[2:00:21] they will give you know palm branches to
[2:00:24] everybody
[2:00:28] and then we stick prime venture we hold
[2:00:29] palm branches we go to church
[2:00:32] amen oh i knew i knew when i used to do
[2:00:35] that
[2:00:36] we hold palm branches we go to church
[2:00:39] but the prophecy
[2:00:40] was blessed is he that coming in the
[2:00:42] name of the lord
[2:00:45] amen before our king cometh
[2:00:48] that was the prophecy but you see the
[2:00:51] church
[2:00:52] just gets stuck to the tradition by
[2:00:54] holding prime branches
[2:00:55] and they don't even have the king in
[2:00:57] their life
[2:00:59] they don't even reference him and
[2:01:00] respect him as king.
[2:01:05] but they just go around the town and cut
[2:01:07] all the pre the palm trees
[2:01:09] disturbing the plant tree for nothing
[2:01:14] when this time jesus does not need a
[2:01:16] palm tree he need us to open our heart
[2:01:18] and say blessed is that that the king
[2:01:21] that cometh in my heart
[2:01:25] he want to ride on us like the donkey
[2:01:31] are we together
[2:01:34] so you see there there are a lot of
[2:01:36] things that play their right in prophecy
[2:01:38] you will see why the the the the high
[2:01:41] praises told the people quiet keep quiet
[2:01:44] and jesus said if you tell them to keep
[2:01:46] quiet the sun will raise up
[2:01:49] all of those things were taken right
[2:01:51] they were taking place
[2:01:52] right in that time
[2:02:00] so you bible students you can go home
[2:02:02] and read your bible again i
[2:02:04] i sure have given you some work amen
[2:02:08] and then we can come back and talk about
[2:02:10] it
[2:02:11] so that's that's one other thing the
[2:02:14] principle of the three days
[2:02:16] that's what caught me into the subject i
[2:02:18] want to talk about today
[2:02:21] the rehab scholar trade
[2:02:28] think about it what inspired her
[2:02:31] that she could not take a blue thread
[2:02:35] she couldn't take a white or a black
[2:02:37] trait
[2:02:40] she took a scarlet thread
[2:02:45] to let down those those pies
[2:02:50] young people the things about the things
[2:02:53] of god is not a guest game
[2:02:57] you have to love the lord god with all
[2:02:59] your heart
[2:03:00] it's not a guest game it's not you being
[2:03:02] smart
[2:03:04] praise the lord
[2:03:08] we have never went to church before
[2:03:11] but god was dealing with her heart every
[2:03:15] time she listened to the news and she
[2:03:17] heard about ezra coming closer
[2:03:21] there was something that was in her
[2:03:23] heart something
[2:03:24] that fear that she was feeling in her
[2:03:26] heart
[2:03:28] and that's what brother branham says a
[2:03:29] lot of the time when you feel nervous
[2:03:32] he said when you are feeling nervous
[2:03:36] it does not mean that altogether you are
[2:03:38] wrong
[2:03:40] he says it's it's a holy spirit that is
[2:03:43] hovering over you
[2:03:46] you just feel nervous you feel
[2:03:47] uncomfortable lord i don't know what
[2:03:50] i wonder what what's happening to me
[2:03:54] praise the lord
[2:03:57] is god trying to get your attention
[2:04:06] but she never been to church you don't
[2:04:07] know anything about that
[2:04:13] she had to choose that path of life for
[2:04:16] her to be able to
[2:04:17] take care of herself and take care of
[2:04:19] her family you see this girl
[2:04:22] even though she was living
[2:04:25] a horrible what we were called a
[2:04:27] horrible unaccepted lifestyle
[2:04:30] but you see the love that she had for
[2:04:33] her father's house
[2:04:37] the love that she had for her king
[2:04:39] dreams
[2:04:43] and which of course i believe it was not
[2:04:45] everybody that supported her in her
[2:04:47] life's time
[2:04:50] glory be to god
[2:04:57] amen why why she didn't take
[2:05:03] you know uh a different color she had to
[2:05:07] take a skullet
[2:05:08] a red rope
[2:05:12] and she let them down and they told her
[2:05:16] this very same rope
[2:05:18] when you put it up just leave a little
[2:05:20] one hanging
[2:05:27] the same line that you let us down by
[2:05:35] praise the lord glory be to god
[2:05:40] amen oh thank you jesus
[2:05:45] thank you lord you love the lord
[2:05:49] [Music]
[2:05:54] oh what a wonderful jesus brother adam
[2:05:56] said yeah in the message christ
[2:05:58] i had my nose all scattered so i didn't
[2:06:00] bring my quotes through but
[2:06:01] we can deal with the few that i have
[2:06:03] here now all
[2:06:05] the way from genesis to revelation
[2:06:10] is a rare strike of redemption
[2:06:13] all through the bible
[2:06:16] that's how howard rehab house stood on
[2:06:20] the wall of jericho
[2:06:22] when all the rest failed because
[2:06:25] there was a scholar thread down the
[2:06:30] outside
[2:06:31] and god honored the scholars tribes
[2:06:35] that's what caused the children of
[2:06:37] israel not to be slain
[2:06:40] in egypt the other son because there was
[2:06:44] a blood on the door
[2:06:48] when the deaf angel passed by
[2:06:53] that's what caused the church today
[2:06:57] in the last plague death the church
[2:07:00] is the only one that we live today and i
[2:07:04] go
[2:07:04] out oh my goodness me
[2:07:08] praise the lord
[2:07:12] when i see the blood i will pass over
[2:07:16] you
[2:07:17] that's right now but you can you can
[2:07:19] understand that god
[2:07:22] was not just looking for the for a
[2:07:24] literal blood
[2:07:29] god was looking for something that he
[2:07:32] can look through
[2:07:34] not something that he can look at
[2:07:43] he was looking for something that he can
[2:07:45] log through
[2:07:55] red true red
[2:08:03] so you see there for for
[2:08:06] uh uh the the the the people of israel
[2:08:09] in goshen
[2:08:10] it was a blood on the door
[2:08:14] but for rahab it was not a blood it was
[2:08:16] a rare
[2:08:20] treat
[2:08:26] i mean leviticus it was a red huffer
[2:08:33] it was not what he want to look at is
[2:08:36] what he want to look
[2:08:37] at you through
[2:08:44] oh glory be to god
[2:08:50] that's what caused the church today oh i
[2:08:52] love the lord jesus
[2:08:55] amen see the church will be the only
[2:08:57] thing that will live
[2:08:58] through this uh modern stake a church
[2:09:01] what gospel
[2:09:03] is those who got the blood
[2:09:06] on the dopples here amen
[2:09:11] of the blood of the lord jesus christ
[2:09:16] now so you see the thing that is there
[2:09:19] uh uh uh uh like the scripture said the
[2:09:21] letter killer the spirit gave your life
[2:09:24] people get stuck in today so you say god
[2:09:26] says when i apply the blood i will pass
[2:09:28] over you
[2:09:29] he says uh you know the blood of jesus
[2:09:32] so
[2:09:32] the nominal church the guests talk in
[2:09:34] that
[2:09:35] and they think that god has to see the
[2:09:38] literal blood
[2:09:39] so that talks about all the blood oh uh
[2:09:41] yeah the blood of jesus
[2:09:42] the blood cover me
[2:09:46] it's not what god wants to look at
[2:09:49] it's what he want to look through
[2:09:54] praise the lord so when god looked at
[2:09:57] his church today
[2:09:59] he's not looking
[2:10:02] at us
[2:10:05] through electoral blood he's looking at
[2:10:08] us through
[2:10:09] a bleeding promises
[2:10:12] that's the reason why the word of god
[2:10:16] is the blood to the church
[2:10:19] he's looking through the promises that
[2:10:22] he have probably he have prophesied
[2:10:24] and promised for this day
[2:10:30] that's the reason why john says if we
[2:10:33] walk in the light
[2:10:36] as he is in the light
[2:10:40] and what is the light the word is the
[2:10:42] light
[2:10:43] when we walk in the light then we have
[2:10:47] access to the blood so our connection
[2:10:51] to the blood is the light is the word of
[2:10:55] god
[2:10:56] when we walk in the light of god for our
[2:10:59] day
[2:11:00] and connect us to the blood
[2:11:08] you can stream the blood all you want
[2:11:11] and don't push the devil's back
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:16] but when you take the promise and say
[2:11:18] satan god said in his word
[2:11:20] [Music]
[2:11:22] you say you devil god said in his word
[2:11:25] by his scribe i'm here that's the thing
[2:11:28] that pushed the devil's back
[2:11:30] you can cry the blood the blood cover me
[2:11:32] in the blood bathe me you can do all of
[2:11:34] that
[2:11:35] they don't fear the devil because he
[2:11:37] knows where the blood
[2:11:38] is he knows where the blood is
[2:11:47] praise the lord it's not what he wants
[2:11:49] to look at
[2:11:50] is what he's looking through god is
[2:11:53] looking through his promises
[2:11:55] at his bride
[2:11:59] glory to god praise the lord
[2:12:03] you can take a red the most pretty red
[2:12:06] cloth and hang it through your window
[2:12:08] be like rahab
[2:12:15] you can go and take a red cloth and hang
[2:12:16] it through your window
[2:12:20] it's not what you want to look at it's
[2:12:23] what he's looking through
[2:12:31] oh glory be to god man jesus
[2:12:36] amen
[2:12:41] praise the lord can i pour some of this
[2:12:43] water over my head
[2:12:47] am i allowed
[2:12:50] no i would not uh i would not think
[2:12:54] brother jordan would be happy with me
[2:12:59] praise the lord amen
[2:13:04] he don't want me to spoil his uh pretty
[2:13:07] mac
[2:13:08] having my ear
[2:13:12] but it's beautiful for falling in love
[2:13:16] with jesus
[2:13:18] it's the best thing
[2:13:21] that i've ever done amen the best thing
[2:13:24] that have ever happened to me
[2:13:26] i was just playing the song the other
[2:13:29] day
[2:13:30] the best thing that have ever happened
[2:13:32] to me
[2:13:34] falling in love with jesus brother
[2:13:37] branham says just love him
[2:13:38] amen hey just love him
[2:13:52] oh my goodness me
[2:13:55] the church will be the only thing
[2:13:59] that we get across all these shush with
[2:14:01] gospel
[2:14:02] amen and just romping people off and
[2:14:06] making people
[2:14:07] radical praise the lord
[2:14:10] some people think being radical is faith
[2:14:13] no
[2:14:16] the more faith you have the more humble
[2:14:19] the more
[2:14:20] simple you will be
[2:14:23] amen why should you be radical
[2:14:26] when you trust in the law to be your
[2:14:28] defense just surrounded let him fight
[2:14:30] your battle
[2:14:42] he says they know where they are
[2:14:44] standing
[2:14:45] if they are really born again
[2:14:49] they were not entangled with every yoke
[2:14:54] and every doctrine and every and and
[2:14:56] talks about year and dead
[2:14:59] with every cut
[2:15:03] they know where they are standing in
[2:15:05] christ
[2:15:06] through the blood
[2:15:11] standing in christ true
[2:15:14] it's what he's looking through
[2:15:18] it's not what he's looking at
[2:15:21] lord many times we think he's looking
[2:15:24] at me he's not looking at you he's
[2:15:27] looking through the blood
[2:15:31] that's why he the father don't see all
[2:15:33] the weaknesses
[2:15:34] in me because he's looking through
[2:15:39] the blood
[2:15:43] he's not looking at me
[2:15:46] praise the lord oh jesus thank you
[2:15:51] hallelujah
[2:15:55] you love him this morning what a
[2:15:58] wonderful savior
[2:16:01] he is yes you see that's why god sent a
[2:16:04] prophet
[2:16:07] because the church all through the ages
[2:16:11] like brother baron said in the church
[2:16:12] age book the church
[2:16:17] idolatry has run in parallel
[2:16:24] with christianity right from the garden
[2:16:27] of eden
[2:16:29] it has run in parallel and has run so
[2:16:32] close
[2:16:34] and they have some places where it has
[2:16:37] even
[2:16:38] intertwined
[2:16:44] christianity versus idolatry better
[2:16:46] better than talk on those things
[2:16:48] and that's the reason why we have to be
[2:16:50] we we we
[2:16:52] we have to trust the lord we have to be
[2:16:54] careful because it's so easy
[2:16:56] to go into idolatry it's so easy
[2:17:01] to think that you are worshiping god
[2:17:04] when you have stopped shot of
[2:17:05] worshipping god
[2:17:07] and you're just worshiping at church
[2:17:10] worshiping a movement called the message
[2:17:13] worshipping a
[2:17:14] prophet and you're not worshiping god
[2:17:18] brother branham says uh uh god reaching
[2:17:20] mercy
[2:17:21] he says every time that god gave the
[2:17:23] people anatomy
[2:17:28] something that's supposed to bring them
[2:17:29] closer to god
[2:17:32] they end up making an idol out of that
[2:17:35] fight
[2:17:38] when god gave them the brazen serpent
[2:17:41] when you look at the brazing serpent you
[2:17:42] will be healed
[2:17:45] they make an adult out of it it took
[2:17:48] hezekiah to destroy the brazen serpent
[2:17:53] they make an idol
[2:17:59] the tabernacle in the wilderness they
[2:18:01] make an idol out of it
[2:18:07] the prophet moses to make an idol out of
[2:18:09] him
[2:18:12] idolatry is means
[2:18:19] striving to reach to god
[2:18:24] man trying to trying to make it with god
[2:18:30] without using god's provision
[2:18:39] it runs so close people so close
[2:18:50] he says there will be the one the one
[2:18:56] the ones that have the door the the
[2:18:58] blood on their doorposts the word apply
[2:19:00] the bleeding word the lord the the blood
[2:19:03] of jesus christ
[2:19:04] the new birth he says they know where
[2:19:07] they are standing
[2:19:09] if they are really born again
[2:19:12] they will not entangle with every yoke
[2:19:14] and every doctrine talks about
[2:19:17] you know in every cut they know where
[2:19:19] they are standing in christ
[2:19:21] through the blood notice the red
[2:19:24] the the half of must be red amen
[2:19:27] that's another sign so here we're
[2:19:29] talking about uh uh
[2:19:31] a rahab scholar me let me close here
[2:19:35] because rahab also she held
[2:19:40] the mystery of redemption
[2:19:44] she held the the the
[2:19:47] the mystery of the three days
[2:19:51] you remember what she told told the the
[2:19:53] the
[2:19:54] the spies i let you down they are going
[2:19:58] to look for you so
[2:20:00] high yourself three days
[2:20:04] she buried them
[2:20:07] and then after three days they
[2:20:08] resurrected
[2:20:10] if they did not listen to her they were
[2:20:12] going to kill them
[2:20:16] so she held the sign of the resurrection
[2:20:21] oh my goodness me no wonder she's in the
[2:20:25] lineage of jesus christ
[2:20:27] no wonder the holy spirit put her name
[2:20:30] there
[2:20:31] [Music]
[2:20:42] oh my praise the lord
[2:20:46] what a wonderful jesus we serve my
[2:20:49] goodness brother branham said here he
[2:20:51] says
[2:20:52] he said fellowship with god true
[2:20:55] reconciliation he said read
[2:20:57] all sort is a sign of danger he said red
[2:21:00] it's a sign of redemption god
[2:21:03] god brings redemption through the red
[2:21:06] blood rehab
[2:21:08] the heart was redeemed
[2:21:12] by the scholar threat
[2:21:15] that left down from her house
[2:21:24] amen
[2:21:26] now that there was there was there there
[2:21:28] was some word also where he tied rehab
[2:21:30] into redemption and uh okay i think
[2:21:34] it's left him the other portion of my
[2:21:35] note okay i'm almost out of time here so
[2:21:38] uh let me now kind of for close this
[2:21:41] up for you but let's look at this let's
[2:21:43] go back to the scripture there in the
[2:21:46] in in uh in the book of joshua
[2:21:50] not rehab this time amen
[2:21:55] let's go in the book of joshua praise
[2:21:57] the lord
[2:22:06] amen
[2:22:08] now the scripture says here
[2:22:13] in verse 15
[2:22:16] then she let them down by a call
[2:22:20] through the window praise the lord
[2:22:23] in verse 18 the bible says
[2:22:27] behold when we come into the land
[2:22:30] thou shalt bound this line of scholar
[2:22:34] threat
[2:22:35] in uh the window which thou has let
[2:22:38] us down back so that's that but just
[2:22:41] that one word
[2:22:42] ba make us to prove that it was the same
[2:22:45] chord
[2:22:46] so here the spines as are using
[2:22:49] a word a line
[2:22:52] there rahab is using talking about the
[2:22:56] same thing but
[2:22:56] using two different words
[2:23:00] are we together praise the lord
[2:23:06] glory to god oh thank you jesus
[2:23:10] amen praise the lord
[2:23:14] hallelujah amen
[2:23:18] glory be to god
[2:23:22] uh you know my my my own pentecost has
[2:23:25] not reached to dancing yet
[2:23:27] amen praise the lord
[2:23:31] it's uh brother andrews and uh you know
[2:23:33] donald reagan those
[2:23:35] guys that can be dancing all over the
[2:23:36] place praise the lord is wonderful
[2:23:39] when i see the holy ghost using the man
[2:23:41] that way
[2:23:43] verse 15 then she let them down
[2:23:48] by a card through the window
[2:23:53] amen and in verse 18 they are telling
[2:23:57] her
[2:23:58] this same car that you let us down by
[2:24:02] you should hang it in your window but
[2:24:04] they are using
[2:24:05] a different word a line
[2:24:09] what does that mean if it is the same
[2:24:11] thing
[2:24:13] praise the lord
[2:24:17] it's the same thing let's not make any
[2:24:19] big thing out of it here
[2:24:21] but let's just look at a little bit
[2:24:24] because
[2:24:25] it holds a mystery
[2:24:28] you know i was telling uh uh uh i i i
[2:24:32] spoke
[2:24:33] here on death does not change your
[2:24:35] nature one wednesday night
[2:24:37] and talking a little bit about the
[2:24:38] millennium and
[2:24:40] i i was looking into something and
[2:24:43] brother branham
[2:24:44] shows there in revelation how
[2:24:49] the the the the ten kings
[2:24:54] you know he show in the scripture
[2:24:57] that how by one word he says
[2:25:00] by one word it shows that they were not
[2:25:04] kings they were detectors
[2:25:11] so just by one word
[2:25:15] it can change
[2:25:19] the story
[2:25:22] sit on our one word
[2:25:26] and eating was not the same again and
[2:25:29] that's the same way god can put
[2:25:31] one word
[2:25:35] it was just only one word by that was a
[2:25:37] word that we find that shows that it was
[2:25:39] the same thread
[2:25:45] but let's look at something here before
[2:25:46] we close
[2:25:50] when you look at the word card that was
[2:25:53] used there
[2:25:54] uh in in in verse 15 by rahab
[2:25:58] that word called is it means rope
[2:26:03] it means a measuring chord
[2:26:07] it means a line so you see it's the same
[2:26:10] word
[2:26:11] just like in verse 18 because it also
[2:26:13] means a line
[2:26:16] but the word also has a meaning
[2:26:20] that means pain sorrow
[2:26:25] and travail
[2:26:29] praise the lord pain
[2:26:32] sorrow and travel
[2:26:38] they were getting down that wall in pain
[2:26:40] and sorrow because their life
[2:26:42] were hunted for
[2:26:46] they were going to go three days in
[2:26:48] travel
[2:26:53] there is no place to cook because they
[2:26:56] are hiding
[2:26:58] from the army of jericho
[2:27:02] three days in pains
[2:27:06] and travel
[2:27:11] glory to god
[2:27:15] and then in verse 18 the spies use the
[2:27:18] same word
[2:27:21] but this time they didn't say a call
[2:27:23] they said a line
[2:27:25] and that word line means
[2:27:30] in hebrew is tick hack a word that is
[2:27:34] spelled
[2:27:35] t i g u uh
[2:27:38] g u av and you will see
[2:27:43] that the the the
[2:27:46] israeli national item is called they'll
[2:27:49] teach
[2:27:49] the the tick ticker
[2:27:53] i got to get this tongue surgery done
[2:27:57] praise the lord and it means
[2:28:01] that the very same word
[2:28:04] that means pain and travel
[2:28:08] in the way that she use it when the
[2:28:11] spies
[2:28:11] use the very same word it means
[2:28:14] hope
[2:28:19] praise the lord it means hope it means
[2:28:23] things to hope for it means
[2:28:26] an outcome
[2:28:29] praise the lord amen
[2:28:33] after three days of pain and travel
[2:28:37] the hope of the word came
[2:28:40] out of the grave
[2:28:48] oh praise the lord oh
[2:28:51] my goodness
[2:28:55] my goodness so you see
[2:28:58] between the rope that was hanged down
[2:29:02] for them
[2:29:03] to come down praise the lord
[2:29:08] and three days so what happened there
[2:29:12] is that the jericho soldiers were all
[2:29:17] outside searching all in the wood all
[2:29:19] around the walls
[2:29:21] of the city so i bet you rehab
[2:29:25] had to bring the call in
[2:29:29] so for three days pains worry
[2:29:32] the sexual house
[2:29:38] and everything
[2:29:41] after three days of fear
[2:29:46] she knew she said for three days
[2:29:50] high yourself and job said
[2:29:54] he will hide me in the grave
[2:29:57] until my change comes
[2:30:03] hire yourself for three days
[2:30:11] man my head is spinning
[2:30:12] [Laughter]
[2:30:14] because i just i just love it when
[2:30:18] god use his word
[2:30:22] and bring out
[2:30:26] three days of pain
[2:30:29] and travel after three days
[2:30:33] hope is on his way
[2:30:37] after three days
[2:30:41] so in in rehab she held
[2:30:46] that's the reason why like i read that
[2:30:49] scripture to you and then
[2:30:50] and the bible says paul says by the
[2:30:53] scripture
[2:30:56] this is what i've received of the lord
[2:30:58] that i give to you
[2:31:01] that by the scripture jesus died
[2:31:05] by the scripture he was buried
[2:31:08] by the scripture he rose again
[2:31:11] so it's in the scripture it's all over
[2:31:15] the death burial and resurrection of
[2:31:17] jesus is all over the scripture
[2:31:19] [Laughter]
[2:31:23] oh my goodness praise the lord
[2:31:27] and here is a heading right in the life
[2:31:29] of rahab
[2:31:31] how in the world when she went
[2:31:34] and bought that rare card from the
[2:31:37] market
[2:31:38] she was not even thinking that spires
[2:31:40] are coming to my house so let me get red
[2:31:42] card
[2:31:43] she just went on shopping one day and
[2:31:45] says this looks long
[2:31:46] maybe i can reach from my window down
[2:31:51] and she bought it god just dropped that
[2:31:54] in her heart
[2:31:59] it is not it is not her physical need
[2:32:05] but that predestinated sea needed a red
[2:32:08] card
[2:32:11] so she shopping down there and bought it
[2:32:14] let me just yeah just take it to the
[2:32:16] house
[2:32:18] praise the lord and she went and just
[2:32:21] threw it on
[2:32:21] her bed it's been there six months two
[2:32:24] years three years
[2:32:29] glory be to god amen
[2:32:34] how in the world
[2:32:39] just like brother branham says heather
[2:32:43] you said the right thing
[2:32:46] and god felt so pleased
[2:32:50] when got on her knees and went under her
[2:32:53] bed and brought that red car
[2:32:55] up glory be to god
[2:32:59] even the spies they could not put any
[2:33:02] interpretation to white
[2:33:04] but almighty god
[2:33:08] that watches over his own amen
[2:33:13] praise the lord almighty god
[2:33:17] now watch over his word
[2:33:23] the god whose world will never be
[2:33:25] defeated
[2:33:28] every word that has gone out of his
[2:33:30] mouth don't return back to him
[2:33:33] if we have to be fulfilled
[2:33:36] god blesses so much
[2:33:42] wow my goodness me
[2:33:50] these fires are hidden in your house
[2:33:52] security alarm all over the country you
[2:33:54] got to get those men
[2:33:56] when she looked down her window oh my
[2:33:59] goodness
[2:34:00] this place is too high if you drop down
[2:34:03] you're going to die
[2:34:04] oh my god what can i do she's checking
[2:34:06] all over the house
[2:34:07] took a curtain down two three they can't
[2:34:09] even reach
[2:34:15] then the holy ghost brought to her mind
[2:34:18] you remember three years ago you bought
[2:34:20] a red card

[2:37:31] what the story is he's talking about a
[2:37:34] prayer line
[2:37:37] and this lady came in the prayer line
[2:37:38] and brother brandon prayed for her
[2:37:41] and she took a prayer card and she was
[2:37:45] number three
[2:37:49] and she came back for another need
[2:37:53] and she prayed she said lord you've been
[2:37:56] so good to me
[2:37:59] the last time father i asked you for
[2:38:01] number three you gave me number three
[2:38:03] she said lord

[2:38:20] and billy paul was giving up uh a prayer
[2:38:23] card
[2:38:24] and when she looked at her number it was
[2:38:28] number 97
[2:38:31] her spirit dropped
[2:38:36] in her heart and brother banham came to
[2:38:40] the pulpit
[2:38:41] and after he got through praying
[2:38:43] preaching
[2:38:45] and he was going into the prayer line
[2:38:46] and he prayed
[2:38:48] and he said lord he says he said this
[2:38:51] morning
[2:38:52] he said for this prayer line we're going
[2:38:54] to start from 100.
[2:38:56] and go backwards
[2:38:59] [Applause]
[2:39:05] he says he says that shows how the holy
[2:39:08] spirit is so precise
[2:39:10] [Music]
[2:39:16] that show how the holy spirit is so
[2:39:19] precise
[2:39:20] and god is precise on your needs
[2:39:25] he's precise but he don't work the way
[2:39:28] your mind thinks
[2:39:31] and sometimes we pray for things and
[2:39:33] pretty soon we throw our bible down and
[2:39:35] say how can i pray for this and
[2:39:37] and then the precision of god does not
[2:39:40] work
[2:39:42] according to the way your mind thinks
[2:39:48] he said this shows how the holy ghost
[2:39:51] is precise
[2:39:59] musicians you can come let's make love
[2:40:01] to jesus a little bit

[2:41:27] notes here one of these days brother
[2:41:29] branham
[2:41:30] talking about
[2:41:36] crisis identified the same he says many
[2:41:38] times we get nervous
[2:41:41] and we begin to think well they ought to
[2:41:44] be
[2:41:45] this way in the auto we have got to make
[2:41:48] it
[2:41:49] this way and make it their way we don't
[2:41:52] have nothing to do into a
[2:41:55] just play our part that he lead us to
[2:41:59] play remember
[2:42:00] there is nothing out of calcutta
[2:42:07] praise the lord

[2:42:21] young people brothers and sisters
[2:42:25] but we can just encourage you

[2:42:31] get in the word
[2:42:34] get in the word i mean it's so easy for
[2:42:36] you to come and play the religion
[2:42:38] just step in church and you are not
[2:42:41] really connected
[2:42:42] to what god is doing in this building
[2:42:48] you are not connected you're living your
[2:42:52] own
[2:42:52] individual life on your own island
[2:42:56] you make your own decision you run your
[2:42:58] own government you do everything you

[2:43:33] put the thoughts of one service to
[2:43:35] another
[2:43:37] and said the lord spoke this time and
[2:43:38] he's speaking this time and this is what
[2:43:40] he said
[2:43:41] and and and last service okay i see why
[2:43:43] the lord used that brother to say this
[2:43:45] and and just bring the picture together
[2:43:57] and that's the thing that we long for
[2:43:59] that's the thing that every pastor look
[2:44:01] for
[2:44:02] you look to see the people connected
[2:44:05] with what the holy spirit is doing
[2:44:12] because it's a body
[2:44:18] [Music]
[2:44:25] if you just got away from the service
[2:44:28] and nothing stays on your mind
[2:44:30] and there is nothing from the word that
[2:44:33] makes you to say
[2:44:34] i have to go back and read that
[2:44:35] scripture again

[3:06:04] to
[3:06:04] to help us as we go away from the
[3:06:06] service this morning and
[3:06:08] this afternoon that god will just you
[3:06:11] know help
[3:06:12] help us to walk in in the commitment
[3:06:15] that we have made to him
[3:06:19] and that's that's the bride you know
[3:06:22] that's that's the bride
[3:06:24] that place of preeminence giving god the
[3:06:28] preeminence
[3:06:31] having him to have his first place in
[3:06:33] our lives
[3:06:35] that is the bride that's that's how the
[3:06:37] rapture is going to be
[3:06:39] you know it's not which church you are
[3:06:41] in and what city you are ain't no
[3:06:44] it's your love to god it's your love to
[3:06:48] god
[3:06:48] [Music]
[3:06:50] that's the reason why struggling to make
[3:06:52] people church member has never been my
[3:06:54] game
[3:06:57] because it does not matter which church
[3:06:59] you are in he's not coming for the
[3:07:01] church
[3:07:02] he's coming for a people that are in
[3:07:04] relationship with him
[3:07:08] or let's just sing there and worship the
[3:07:09] lord now
