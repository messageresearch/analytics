[1:18:33] according his good pleasure
[1:18:35] where he has purpose
[1:18:37] in himself
[1:18:39] that in a differentiation of the
[1:18:41] Buddhists of time he might get together
[1:18:44] in all and won all things in Christ

[1:18:56] inheritance
[1:18:58] then for destinated according to the
[1:19:00] purpose of him workers all things notice
[1:19:04] look at all things
[1:19:11] that we should lead to the phrase of his
[1:19:13] glory who first trusted
[1:19:16] in Christ
[1:19:17] and who all in whom he also trusted
[1:19:20] after that somebody said after that
[1:19:23] he heard the word of Truth the gospel of

[1:19:50] not got to hear us God
[1:19:53] you get glory to get on in his name
[1:19:56] that's when I say amen amen you know
[1:19:58] they see the interest
[1:20:02] isn't he wonderful
[1:20:05] I wanted you to follow up scripture
[1:20:07] tonight
[1:20:09] they come from drones
[1:20:13] which are the Saint from high school no
[1:20:14] this night what a nice glitches that I
[1:20:17] use
[1:20:19] and I applied to my life dearly
[1:20:22] could it keep me
[1:20:24] motivated keep me encouraged to keep me
[1:20:28] from worrying
[1:20:31] kidney for negativism
[1:20:34] they keep me positive yes
[1:20:43] the Bible is saying here in Romans 8 28.
[1:20:52] let me share even now I'm not tests kind
[1:20:55] of found a decent for tonight as you
[1:20:57] will
[1:20:59] the negative that comes
[1:21:02] the positive
[1:21:07] the mystery of
[1:21:10] Israel
[1:21:13] the mystery of his will
[1:21:17] on the 8 28 tell us this
[1:21:21] and we know that all things
[1:21:24] we're together for good
[1:21:30] the deal who are the called according to
[1:21:33] his
[1:21:35] purpose
[1:21:38] the powerful things
[1:21:41] now I don't want to leave you know a can
[1:21:43] of foundation tonight
[1:21:46] the subject is again the negatively come
[1:21:50] from the positive
[1:21:54] and the problem we see this and then
[1:21:56] this is you don't mind
[1:21:58] the identification of Christ in all ages
[1:22:01] 54.
[1:22:04] probably say this
[1:22:06] they're gonna quote number 69.
[1:22:10] I break it down
[1:22:13] the end of the
[1:22:18] he wasn't even God
[1:22:21] God our in his word God you know I
[1:22:25] worship
[1:22:26] but he there wasn't nothing to worship
[1:22:29] him he was just the Eternal amen
[1:22:33] then he will answer this
[1:22:37] anyone know that actually is in other
[1:22:39] words in him were his thoughts
[1:22:42] yes thoughts
[1:22:45] they're his accidents then his word is
[1:22:48] thought expressed is a word
[1:22:52] and then again it was the word
[1:22:56] before it was even at rest do what it
[1:22:59] thought
[1:23:00] actually amen
[1:23:02] Amen in his thinking
[1:23:05] he was to be God
[1:23:07] probably created the ages first
[1:23:11] then he will worship
[1:23:13] he was
[1:23:14] God Amen
[1:23:17] and then in him was actually to the
[1:23:20] father
[1:23:21] to be son
[1:23:24] the savior
[1:23:26] nothing lost
[1:23:29] so they had to be lost the head of the
[1:23:32] away name for death
[1:23:36] to be here
[1:23:40] so we had to
[1:23:42] sit so he could heal it
[1:23:44] the only difference
[1:23:46] he asked for this
[1:23:49] and now remember if you ever did or Hell
[1:23:52] we'll have eternal life you had it with
[1:23:54] him then
[1:23:56] yeah amen God help us yes
[1:24:01] see you had it in him because Jesus came
[1:24:04] and Jesus was the Redeemer
[1:24:07] to do anything it'll bring it back
[1:24:10] but we're important from I went from
[1:24:13] right we did it bring it back and you
[1:24:16] the way you look
[1:24:18] Who You Are
[1:24:20] what your name is that what God thinking
[1:24:23] for the foundation of the world
[1:24:25] and Jesus came not to say the whole
[1:24:28] thing
[1:24:29] cut up
[1:24:30] s he wanted to but he country redeemed
[1:24:33] bringing that to them that was in his
[1:24:36] thoughts
[1:24:37] before the beginning
[1:24:40] that's the reason he was the word named
[1:24:42] flesh
[1:24:43] God was in Christ
[1:24:45] reconcile the world to himself
[1:24:48] the word God speaking of how he would do
[1:24:51] it he expressed himself in Jesus Christ
[1:24:55] you were Godly coming The Cure
[1:24:59] dude I know a lot of people
[1:25:01] that he was God
[1:25:04] Jesus Christ
[1:25:05] come on God oh Testament
[1:25:07] is Jesus Christ of the new
[1:25:10] he's saying that
[1:25:12] now
[1:25:14] where are you now you have to die
[1:25:17] because
[1:25:19] Delight snap a picture
[1:25:22] you're the negative
[1:25:24] any negative had the code into the dark
[1:25:28] room
[1:25:30] God help us
[1:25:32] through acid to develop the picture
[1:25:37] to make you what it is
[1:25:40] so the thing I go to the dark room
[1:25:43] God help us that's right
[1:25:46] listen he said we are now in Express
[1:25:50] innocent him if the negative has been
[1:25:53] taken we are a human life but let's go
[1:25:56] in the dark room down to the Grave go
[1:25:59] through it developing become that form
[1:26:01] in the night in the Innings all night
[1:26:04] young forever all the old age
[1:26:07] all the respect everything will be taken
[1:26:11] away
[1:26:12] do I redeemed
[1:26:15] God actually
[1:26:19] with Christ in the church you're like
[1:26:22] man and his wife that's right Christ and
[1:26:24] the bride because it redeemed that his
[1:26:27] thinking
[1:26:28] and his thinking he'll Express
[1:26:31] out amen
[1:26:36] tonight and I want to express in that
[1:26:38] tonight to you again
[1:26:40] that the negatively coming the positive
[1:26:45] I hate to know that we believe that
[1:26:48] because of the opening of the word
[1:26:51] the in the beginning
[1:26:53] with God
[1:26:56] he said before the kid anyway I don't
[1:26:57] know him
[1:26:58] the self-resistant one
[1:27:01] God there I died alone with his thoughts
[1:27:05] his Action News
[1:27:07] because they expressed in God's time
[1:27:10] and God sees him
[1:27:12] they were never
[1:27:14] before we was
[1:27:17] human
[1:27:19] we were in the thoughts of God
[1:27:23] asked to prepare breasts today as
[1:27:25] president God's time this season amen in
[1:27:27] other words we were there with God but
[1:27:30] then the father God said unless who live
[1:27:32] now tell her that we've now passed out
[1:27:34] the offerness
[1:27:38] out there to come flesh through the
[1:27:41] eternity and tried
[1:27:43] but in that area of class we'll be in
[1:27:47] the development
[1:27:49] God help us
[1:27:52] I want to look for tonight that that's
[1:27:54] where another time we loses sometimes
[1:27:56] hope
[1:27:57] to die we lose faithful fight and a
[1:28:00] development in the dark room
[1:28:02] many times it's a mystery
[1:28:05] and they're tired of uncertainty
[1:28:07] in a dark room
[1:28:09] let me call her now this hour that
[1:28:12] revelation
[1:28:13] released in a dark room come on
[1:28:16] come on God you're developing us
[1:28:18] in the time that I don't understand at
[1:28:21] all but I believe
[1:28:27] to do what he want me to be
[1:28:29] not what Mom and Daddy would need to be
[1:28:31] but God has already preparing my life oh
[1:28:35] so now I can't handle that
[1:28:37] he said not like you for your clan thy
[1:28:39] God so I had to accept what God's will
[1:28:42] is because initially his will Hallelujah
[1:28:46] because I tell God thank you
[1:28:48] that's why I eat that and negatively the
[1:28:51] positive and that is amen now that's
[1:28:56] wide
[1:28:57] in that mystery we couldn't know tonight
[1:28:59] because of the word
[1:29:01] that they're in Genesis
[1:29:03] we've got to understand even in a
[1:29:05] certain that there was a I don't need
[1:29:08] and there you thought either God there's
[1:29:10] no question now the man failed
[1:29:13] though because will
[1:29:16] the devil is dead
[1:29:18] he thought it was it was it was lost
[1:29:22] for the where it was God in his mind
[1:29:26] they were the last Lane
[1:29:28] for me and you
[1:29:30] knowing now we're full
[1:29:34] hello

[1:29:43] flesh
[1:29:54] take them to the nicotine come on for
[1:29:56] our guys are thinking lies
[1:29:58] so the dirt thought he had won
[1:30:01] but remember
[1:30:03] God always in control
[1:30:07] God why is his word
[1:30:10] somebody catch that yeah yeah
[1:30:12] oh his word

[1:30:50] tonight
[1:30:51] there's a positive they're coming the
[1:30:54] negative come to positive
[1:30:56] look what you gotta understand is listen
[1:30:58] to me Governor now Lord give them to
[1:31:00] tell you that ended dark room
[1:31:05] because you didn't develop
[1:31:08] ment it's a mystery
[1:31:10] and sometimes you know we want to know
[1:31:12] the beginning to the end
[1:31:14] God ain't gonna tell us everything
[1:31:18] you need faith
[1:31:20] to know that God got everything in
[1:31:23] control
[1:31:24] ahead I probably said there's nothing I
[1:31:26] Decatur that he said it that's right the
[1:31:29] God order our steps
[1:31:33] righteous you order by the Lord
[1:31:36] somebody tell God I think
[1:31:38] I don't understand hear them tonight if
[1:31:41] that thing looks so awkward then I go
[1:31:44] wrong
[1:31:45] but here Brothers said when things seen

[1:32:21] world and the call he said God so you

[1:32:30] therefore tonight either you're sitting
[1:32:31] here because God has made it so possible
[1:32:34] because in the nursery room in a dark
[1:32:37] room there's a mystery they have in your

[1:33:20] he could increase because you know that
[1:33:23] God would blessed one he would take and
[1:33:25] then the defense seemed so wrong God
[1:33:28] know how to turn around and they were
[1:33:30] for not good because I tell God thank
[1:33:32] you you're right here in front of God
[1:33:33] said listen he said there's a law of God
[1:33:36] there are law of God and the Lord God

[1:34:51] listen here
[1:34:53] God gave me
[1:34:55] so many situations
[1:34:57] a promising in the Bible
[1:34:59] they look like it was a negative
[1:35:01] the God needs to come to positive

[1:47:18] hold to it
[1:47:20] [Music]
[1:47:23] because it's sure God did to you he'll
[1:47:26] allow you to go through dark room a dark
[1:47:28] room
[1:47:29] look what they're doing hold this what
[1:47:31] he said
[1:47:32] in a dark room what God is doing loading
[1:47:34] character
[1:47:39] in your dark room God is character when
[1:47:42] you build your heart you're the
[1:47:44] experience he will his Spirit patients
[1:47:47] patient holding not ashamed the little
[1:47:49] guy said brought our heart that are hard
[1:47:51] to go
[1:47:53] dealing characters
[1:47:55] in your dark room
[1:48:00] what is the gig called that negatively
[1:48:03] the positive
[1:48:04] but it's the mystery of his will against
[1:48:06] amen
[1:48:08] noticed
[1:48:11] I'm saying what to say okay
[1:48:14] he said now and this is
[1:48:16] the god change his mind
[1:48:20] this is satisfied
[1:48:22] 427
[1:48:25] . he said so we really believe that God
[1:48:27] never changed his mind about what he
[1:48:30] said
[1:48:31] he always keep the truth
[1:48:33] but he had a pernicious wheel
[1:48:36] yeah right praise the Lord I'll read
[1:48:38] what he said yeah now they're aware
[1:48:41] the troubles lead
[1:48:43] we try to wait on God in this wheel
[1:48:45] and he will commit it but also if we
[1:48:49] take the mistress will do it not right
[1:48:51] he will make it his conditions will to
[1:48:54] work out together to glorify his purple
[1:48:56] wheel
[1:48:57] they're scrolling in it yeah nothing
[1:49:00] will go wrong with God
[1:49:02] he knows just where the clock is taken
[1:49:04] at tonight
[1:49:05] there's nothing wrong Eric literally hit
[1:49:08] it exactly the way it should be
[1:49:10] everything we think it wrong but he know
[1:49:13] it right it's supposed to be like this
[1:49:19] sin to come he didn't that wasn't his
[1:49:22] perfect will but you see God a great
[1:49:25] spirit the father and him was answer
[1:49:27] these and anything that was that you see
[1:49:30] declared now is just the actually being
[1:49:33] displayed he dwelled alone that's right
[1:49:35] he wasn't not even God God and object I
[1:49:38] wish he was a great Eternal one and in
[1:49:41] him way I seduce such aired to the
[1:49:43] father to the Savior to the Healer and
[1:49:46] now how can you do that he had to the
[1:49:48] father to call you through he will
[1:49:50] follow but he prayed alone he alone is
[1:49:53] Immortal and now but he actually had to
[1:49:56] be displayed now do they say you they
[1:49:59] had to be something lost yeah and God
[1:50:02] cannot perfectly lose anything and then
[1:50:04] redeem it oh
[1:50:09] Holiness and a great judgment
[1:50:12] that he was a man on the Lord three more
[1:50:16] Nation knowing that man will fall we'll
[1:50:18] fail and in that he became man himself
[1:50:22] in order to redeemed that man that that
[1:50:25] failed that the reason that Jesus was
[1:50:27] Emmanuel of God God sent another person
[1:50:31] deciding himself and then that wouldn't
[1:50:33] be just a guy had come himself and take
[1:50:37] place and God could not they come down
[1:50:40] in spirit and take place he had to be
[1:50:42] made flesh In the Flesh of his own
[1:50:46] created son
[1:50:47] and he know he showed here in the
[1:50:50] beginning that her will went to the
[1:50:53] crazy man out of the desert Earth but

[1:56:09] here Brothers one I deal with that on
[1:56:12] the whole house the Lord happened to you

[1:56:16] yeah
[1:56:18] yeah I had to say deepness in myself
[1:56:20] then how did a man that took another man
[1:56:23] killed and I said God he's a nasty own
[1:56:26] heart
[1:56:28] it's sure what God looks at
[1:56:30] God lit that adjourned yeah

[1:57:33] guy had a soul that
[1:57:36] she was able to get into the kingdom
[1:57:38] because he wanted the the crocodiles
[1:57:41] what amazing I say
[1:57:43] that the king had chosen to put in
[1:57:46] purification to be ready for the king to
[1:57:49] have
[1:57:51] but it's amazing how when God chooses
[1:57:55] choose his own will the mystery of his
[1:57:58] will
[1:57:59] he already sitting here God choose the
[1:58:02] initial his own wheel many times you

[2:10:20] it's just a shadow and not the real
[2:10:23] thing it's a negative side it takes
