in the house of the Lord morning we want to thank the Lord for his goodness we want to thank the Lord for his grace his love and mercy praise the Lord amen amen amen you know the Lord has a way of drawing us to a place of where he want us to be you know what I serve as a church we the Lord has blessed us with you know good music and good praise singers but I think what maybe he want to bring us to is to bring us to a place of worship because there is a complete difference between praise and worship one of the people I used to praise singing even the slower song they want to make it loud sometimes you just need to think and just lift your hands without clapping and just rest your mind on the Lord sometimes that's that I mean he's the one we are worshiping is not to bring yourself satisfaction is to bring him satisfaction praise the Lord so you see when the worship goes like this then you start to feed it's bad that you're not enjoying the worship you are not supposed to enjoy it he's supposed to enjoy it amen God bless you brother praise the Lord amen he's the one we are worshiping we are now worshiping you you are now worshiping me you are now worshiping the song leader we are worshiping him and that's when we have to be conscious of that because when we are in a situation like this and it looks like the sun is going this way and then we get we get take off in our emotion in our feelings and then you know the devil knows how to get right in there and then he starts to make you to feel miserable and then you think that you are feeling sorry for the song leader or you think that uh you know the worship is going out of place and it's all because we we we we love to bring satisfaction to ourself we want to we want to shake our body we want to move ourself and we are not even conscious that the one that we are worshiping is the one up there and it's to him that we must bring all the praise it is to him that we must bring all the worship you see when you play the the tambourine and you play the the the salsa or shaking thing there you have to realize that you are not leading the service don't play those things more than how the song leader is singing he's the one leading the things you're not leading this so it's almost like you're trying to play it fast so the song can go fast you're another one in the lead is the spirit that is leading the service [Music] praise the Lord that's why we must be conscious of he's the one that we have come to worship and we must be able to bring that worship to him [Music] to satisfy ourselves not to satisfy our emotion if the spirit lead us in a way to dance we will dance if we think that every service we must go around the building know God has a way of grabbing our attention praise the Lord he has a way of grabbing our attention because he deserve Our Praise he won our praise he won he had brought us he has redeemed Us by his blood so we can be able to bring praise and worship to him [Music] are we together let's stand on our faith we are standing on Holy Ground let's sing there let's Worship the Lord a little bit [Music] we are standing on holy grind and I know that dead all around Let Us Praise Jesus now for we are standing in his presence [Music] on the Lord all around Jesus now for we must stand in his presence [Music] let's sing out one more time oh yes we win [Music]

following the service we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen for the services in a weaker I just told Dr Jordan will make some changes I have a reason to be away the uh this week so the Wednesday night service will be put on Friday night so let's have a prayer meeting Friday night and then the Sun the weekend stays just oscillate but a Mac will fly in uh Saturday morning and he will speak for us Saturday night and Sunday morning so Wednesday night there will be no service and uh we will meet on Friday evening it's our same service time at seven o'clock and we will just have a prayer meeting that evening we were going to have a prayer meeting Wednesday night anyway brother Andrew boscal from shivac actually was supposed to speak for us on Wednesday night but he's traveling to Philadelphia for their Easter services there with brothers and the brothers there and they flew in on Friday Thursday night Friday we met up with them and visited with birming going down to preach for better Joe piasco so he was supposed to come back on Monday or Tuesday pray for us on Wednesday and then get on his way to Philadelphia but he's driving and he's driving with his family so leaving Thursday to be in Philadelphia for service on Friday would have been a little bit tough for him and so um we just thought okay he should go down to Wisconsin preach relax himself and then he can have uh uh an easy drive to Philadelphia during the week which of course you want to stop some of the few other places and visit so that's the reason why he would now speak for us on Wednesday night so then I just thought okay since I have some few things on my hands to do uh my one of my good good old friend brother Bill Young he's now well uh spoke with his wife he's been in and out with his heart so uh I'm trusting the Lord to be able to see if I can reach there and and visit with him and the wife called me now to pray for him most of the time he will call whenever he's not feeling too well and we will pray it on the phone and so we want to we just want to see if we can get there Wednesday night visit with him at home and then get back for the service so Friday evening at seven o'clock we'll be here for the prayer meeting it's not an all-night prayer meeting it's a regular weekday prayer meeting so don't uh don't sleep don't bring food let's just come we'll pray we'll let you to go home timely enough so we can be back Thursday night for service praise the Lord so let's just read Matthew chapter 21. God bless you Daniel Stan let's read don't worry let's read from verse 1 and when the drove night onto Jerusalem and we came to Bath health onto the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway I try to keep mine eye service here and I keep forgetting go into the village over against you in straight well fine uh straight away yes and a call with her lose them and bring them unto me and if any man say art unto you yesha said the Lord have need of them in straight way he shall send him all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughters of Zion Behold thy King cometh unto they make and sitting upon on us and Accord therefore upon us and the disciple went and did as Jesus commanded him and brought the eyes and the cause and pulled on Port on them their cloth and they sat him there on and a a great multitude spray their Garden in the way others cut down branches from the trees and and spread them in the way and the multitude that went before and their follow Christ saying Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest and when he was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is Jesus a prophet of Nazareth of Galilee let us pray Heavenly Father Lord we ask your blessing upon the portion of your word that we have read we will ask that Lord God you will take uh a touch out of it Lord and bless us this morning uh with the burden that is upon our heart to Father we just pray that God you will come out of the pages of your word and father Lord May something of God be said that we encourage us Lord something that will draw us closer to the foot of the cross that will help us in our walk with you Lord we just want to thank you we want to appreciate you father as we just commit ourselves in your hands now in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat sorry for keeping you standing very long praise the Lord I took a little talk year I wrote a Brandon priest a series of them who is this who is this but actually what I want to look into this morning is from Marca chapter 7 verse 6. a Man's enemy are the mans of his own house praise the Lord a Man's enemy are the mans of his own house then I was I was uh City in there a little bit in and what I was trying to to write that as a as a sub title or subject or inspiration whichever way we want to term it writing a man's anime uh the mans of his own house that's that's the way that Mike has said it in Micah chapter 7 I was writing there and it just it just you're just like a flash to my mind a Man's enemy are the members of his own house and I was thinking about the members of his body praise the Lord that's where my mind was going uh because brother Branham said you are your own enemy amen he says my worst enemy is William Branham so uh that's where we want to go this morning so don't start don't start running your mind on your children or on your husband or on your wife look at your own house amen look at your own house look at the members look at your attitude look at your habits amen because there are all of the things that that are worrying against you amen so I think I free myself from the hope this morning praise the Lord amen we want to thank the Lord for that but uh one of the reasons why my mind I came to death is because if you remember in Marca chapter 5 there was word uh the prophecy of little Beth to him came out of and and that prophecy was pointed out to the wise man when they when they came over in uh looking for uh the one the Worcester they have followed for we have seen his side in the East and we have come to worship Him amen praise the Lord amen uh I was I was listening to a friend of mine he was preaching he said he says this he said he said wise man goes to church amen he says wise man goes to church they see the star and he goes to worship he says so if you are watching this age that's the best place to go to go to church praise the Lord now so uh that brought the the breath of Jesus and then I'm I was looking at us I was I was telling this uh during the week then my mind went over to their scripture that amends uh anime the man of his own house and uh even our lord Jesus referred to it uh you know he he referred to that scripture but uh this morning before we we do that we want to look at this this Grace scene Wednesday night we brought a little bit on that talking about uh the two period of time that Jesus how to cleanse the temple it was at the beginning of his ministry and the end of his ministry now if you read uh [Music] the gospel and uh and and in a way that many many of the the scholars write the scripture he almost looks like Jesus only went to Jerusalem during the time of the feast but you have to realize that uh there were there were many times of the feast that he went to Jerusalem praise the Lord and uh and and this was the time of the Passover this was the time of the Passover you have to we have to what I want I'm trusting the Lord to do is to kind of create a a picture in our Imam in our mind this morning I'm not a good person to dramatize but I will try my best now so you have to realize that this is the time of the Passover and the Passover was very very significant to uh the Jewish people to the Jews or in their mind they remember the time that Moses brought them out of Egypt praise the Lord amen so every time they they celebrated this Passover they uh they are looking for God to raise up their Prophet like unto Moses amen they are looking for God to raise up their Prophet like unto Moses so yerry said now Jesus coming in and they are seeing you know uh uh trying to identify his ministry with the scripture they are they uh I mean Nicodemus came up and and and confessed by night that we We believe We who we the San hindrance the council it was made out of the Pharisees and the Sadducees we believe that you are a man sent from God no man can do this praise the Lord so these are the things that they are talking in their meetings they are talking behind those and uh uh but yet you have to realize that a you have to realize that uh uh the people at that time they were at such a place where you we know their room at the time was ruling the word and they were they were on the Roman governance but uh uh uh they were not they were not willing to submit themselves to that because they were always believing that God promised them a son of David that would come upon the throne praise the Lord so this was a tense moment this was a very very tense moment for the people at that time with all that they have seen in the ministry of Jesus Christ you know brother Branham told us there were a lot of secret Believers not only Jairus there were a lot of them that were secret believers praise the Lord amen I mean there is nowhere we heard about uh Joseph amateus until after the death he showed up too he was a secret believer so there were many secret Believers and all they were all standing by and waiting for is there are four identification where they can see this man just like uh Moses you know challenging now there are few things as we are in this period there are a few things I want to point out before I go into my message this morning you remember that pilot uh uh we we would talk about him he was a young uh uh Roman prefect okay they are they have just started giving him some influence so now he's assigned to uh uh Jerusalem to be able to come uh you know all the little riots that were coming up because you have to realize John the Baptist has just come and then he's preaching the kingdom of God he's creating a sin praise the Lord and the people are murmuring is this the Maasai they went to meet him are you the Messiah are you Elijah or are you that prophet praise the Lord so Rome is getting worse that Elena is rising praise the Lord after the wise man would travel and come into Jerusalem where is he born King of the Jews Rome is getting worse that there's a leader among these people so now the need to send somebody that will be able to calm the crowd and get the people down get their loyalty back to Rome so pilate was the one they sent he was a young young man he was not an old man he was a young prefect praise the Lord another saying there that we have to wash here is there tell when Talent had the privilege now to to uh to have Jesus uh that there's a beautiful story there there's a beautiful picture uh but pilot Rome at a time was the one that was appointing whoever was the priest so the priests clarifies it was a political office it was not a religious office praise the Lord it was a political office they appointed whoever the priest was at the time are we together amen I'm trying to create a picture here so I can find find a place to put my foot amen so uh uh we will see here that when uh uh pilate was uh you know interrogating our lord Jesus he got to a place where he uh pick up uh a place in the Torah where at every feast day there is one that must be released onto the people and then uh the whole scene of barabars came on the scene now the reason why I want to drive to this is the other you will see what the people shouted and says you know crucify him give us barbers now if you read the gospel you will realize that uh Barabas the Bible says that uh you know he killed a man like amen and what was that actually was because uh and and and you know a Barabas will not be arrested unless this was a political sin so it is is looking more close like uh this was a Roman soldier that he killed praise the Lord so right at that scene the people who see Barabbas to be a more revolutionary amen this man Jesus he healed our sake he's raising our dead but he's not challenging the Roman Authority even though he's talking about there's a kingdom that is coming praise the Lord so you see the people were ready to get behind Jesus emotionally amen they were they were looking for somebody they will you know create a riot so they can stand against Rome praise the Lord you have to remember even just before his Ascension they asked you is this the time that you're going to restore unto us the kingdom of David praise the Lord amen now so you see those were all of the things that were happening at that time there were all of those things that were happening at that time I'm going to point out some few things here let's look in Luke chapter 22 quickly when you go through the gospel you pick up bit and pieces but when you come over here to Luke chapter 22 praise the Lord now if you read Luke chapter 22 you get down to verse 66. let me start from there now what what are the what picture is going to be uh I create a year for us that I want for us to see is the other Jesus coming into Jerusalem that we just read he came at this time of the Passover and now you have to realize that uh uh Moses back in Exeter this was during the the the the moon of Nissan and the sacrifice had to be examined four days praise the Lord amen so Jesus his entry into Jerusalem is just around that time he came exactly on point of the scripture praise the Lord and now so when you read from uh Luke 22 you will see that Jesus there's a place I want us to get to so we will not read all of that but you will realize that Jesus had the privilege to be examined first but the priests amen amen they call him to be examined by the priests and then after that they took him over to pilate for him to be a zombie praise the Lord and then after that Paul has sent him over to herop to be a zombie praise the Lord amen he had to he had to go through all of there because I call him towards Moses said was that the lamb that was going to be sacrificed for the Passover have to be examined terribly you have to take four days to examine it for no blemish amen praise the Lord so he was examine the first evening by the high priest they sent him over to college the second day and over to Herod and Hera sent him back to Poland and every one of them said they found no fought in him are we together so but I want for us to look at chapter 23 Luke 23 verse 12. Luke 23 verse 12 praise the Lord it looks like I have a stinking here okay then the Bible says and the same day pilate and Herod were made friends together for before they were at immunity between themselves now so the the the the even at his death he created a friendship okay and about what what the picture here that I wanted to for us to see is that both the the Council of the priesthood uh Harem now Hera was a local Governor but he was serving under the Roman government praise the Lord amen if we want to look a little bit into their history is the other uh you realize that even Jesus he called Pharaoh uh you call hero a fox all because that he was an Edomite he was not a Jew praise the Lord but he was appointed to be a government or Governor over there in Galilee so in some sense he was also working for the Roman government but you have to understand the the politics that is playing here these people are ruled by the Romans that that do not believe in their God the Romans believe that the emperor was their God praise the Lord and wherever that room ruled they bring the people to believe in the Emperor as their God but they could not do their year in Jerusalem because the Jews will not worship no one else but the one God the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob praise the Lord amen so you've seen here that the Council of the high priest the the the the the Roman present palette and also the local government Governor they all have to come into agreement for the word to be crucified praise the Lord now brother bran I'm there with that in United signing time he told us that's exactly what is going to happen for the word to be crucified they have to be a uniting so that was the reason why I point out that scripture even though they were not friends but when it comes to this place of destroying the word they had to put their differences apart praise the Lord they have to put their differences apart now where I'm coming to with all of this is there because the same thing is facing you and myself okay the same thing is facing you and myself that's what that's where I'm coming to with all of this but I just want to get into into that into that history a little bit so we we can see we realize that there were many men that uh that that that strive to deliver Israel even just just before the time just just before uh palette was sentient it was the rising of uh of uh John the Baptist and uh and and and and all the Roman that was growing about of one born King of the Jews that their room had to send a prefect to make sure that there is no King that rise under no King besides Caesar are we together now so uh uh there was one slave called Simon and uh uh there was also a shepherd uh I trusted and one Judas of Galilee all of these men uh they created some some Riot they gathered some group and they were determined to deliver the people but Rome have to stamp them down praise the Lord amen so it brings back into picture why the people who have prepared Barabbas over Jesus because whatever his art was they felt like he did it for the Jewish people he rebelled that he's he stood against Rome but you see that Jesus Was preparing a spiritual Kingdom amen he was bringing a king in our hearts praise the Lord because even even uh if he would have set up a physical Kingdom they will have still rebelled against him because their heart has gone away from the Lord even in the world like unto Moses when Moses was saying praise the Lord amen when Moses was sent to deliver Moses never had it easy why because the people heart has already been taken by Egypt Egypt had their hearts they were just only wearing an outward identification by Egypt had their heart history will tell us you will see why Quran and dating and all of those men that gave Moses problem in a Wilderness they were always pointing back to Egypt they were always pointing back to Egypt and history have taught us this they are the uh you know whenever a people are in are in captivity or the people has been captured what will happen is they are the uh uh the the dominant power is going to choose some men from among the very people so there are uh uh the ruling power is going to choose our police from ourself hmm praise the Lord so as long as we can get few men that knows what they believe and knows uh you know how we can get to the depths of their secret we can pin them down praise the Lord during the Holocaust it was the same it was Jews on Jews praise the Lord amen and don't and don't think that you will be spared the same precious Lord it would take people that I've hanged around this message people that knows what the co-h people that knows everything about the the five coming about Elijah they know what the pillar of fire is you know everything about this message it will take those very same people to be able to persecute us so a Man's enemy is man's from his own house they have always been like that praise the Lord a talking to commit the first murder anime was a man of his own house praise the Lord are we together Ishmael and Isaac came from the same house but they are at local head Issa and Jacob came from the same womb but they are at local heritage it talked Joseph Brothers to sell him to Egypt praise the Lord amen so it would take the ones that have hanged around this message but never got to a talking life they hang around the message but they never got a truth talking I thought I would speak on the truth talking tonight for the communion they never got a truth talking praise the Lord amen and what was that truth talking rehab was the one that used that statement that told the spies give me a truth token praise the Lord amen and what they said and respond to her our life for yours the true talking is not a church membership the true talking is alive on this plane praise the Lord it's not how long you've been around the message it's not whether you are born in the message is now who I mean uh I mean how you grew up in the message is the life of Jesus Christ on this plane are we together amen so you see that's that's uh that's that's where we are going yet even though we we're trying to make this picture of the Passover but it has to take it has to take the Jews and and in the way that it was it is it is it is uh we we can look at it in the place of uh you know of of Prophecy being fulfilled but prophecy is always fulfilled when they when when the world can be able to get the people whose heart are in that direction praise the Lord so we see here the other uh we look at a portion of that in some on Wednesday night uh Jesus coming there in Jerusalem he came he came right down that path you know he came right down their scripture that there was one of the first time that Jesus publicly declared that he was the Messiah praise the Lord amen for him to go uh in the public scene and I said you just see the same there let's take a little picture Brown spoke about that and talking about pre-arranged and uh uh uh Jesus sent his disciple and said go go down to the setting place you will see a coach dead and an eyes you know lose them and bring If any man asks you say Sir the master see I should bring it praise the Lord Braham said this in perfect fit it's not in my note there but I will read it he says I want to say that I believe every scripture he says every bit of it is truth there's a credit today that that don't want to believe that a Creator once said that when Jesus sent those disciples to where the cut was tied where two ways met that he pre-arranged that to where the cut was tied see they don't understand God pre-arrange it amen he says it was God that did pre-arrange it now to just to just see the picture Jesus telling his disciple you just go down there you know where there are two Street meets you see the house that is there there is a there is a cause and and and if you look at it in the scripture you will realize that they are called that Jesus sent for has never been ruled upon nobody have ever sat on it before praise the Lord now for him to know exactly where it was and telling them go and get it if any man asks you just tell him that the master sent for it praise the Lord and that is the same way that that God predestinate Our Lives that's the same way that uh he's he's he's dealing with us there's a time a point of time that is set we can fool around and play it around but uh if if God has placed our names on that long Book of Life he has a way to be able to get us praise the Lord is all part of his work of redemption let me read this yet I will start with this brother Braham said in the uh Angel of the Covenant he says and sometimes some of your own household will be the ones that will discourage you first when you are claiming God's promise to yourself praise the Lord we read a Psalm I mean Acts chapter 7. when we were talking about how Stephen brought it out that uh when you look at the way that God deals with Israel they don't always get it the first time and that is not only with Israel that is with the Fallen nature of men we don't get it the first time sometimes we think we get it but we don't get it the first time praise the Lord he has to bring us around the block again before we say oh now I see it praise the Lord now so uh uh uh we can look in the life of Joseph and then we will see that I mean he's born with um he's he's born a dreamer nothing he had to do God gave him that gift praise the Lord amen and uh and then right there we also see the other you know he's he's he's dreaming these uh uh uh having these dreams how his brothers are buying to him and uh uh actually the dream they didn't say his brothers you know he's talked about the the Stars amen let's talk about the you know the moon and and the Sun and all of that but then his father is uh you know uh kind of for reading with the number of stars that is buying down in the moon and the sun you know uh you know they are reading between it you have to realize that these people that God was dealing with amen and uh they had they did not have the Ten Commandments at that time but they had a history of how God there with their father Abraham and how God did with Isaac they had a history about the flawed and all of that they had they had those things so they knew that you know God speaks through those things amen so here is sitting down they are reading between is this uh what what do you mean by these dreams are you are you saying that God you know all that you're saying that we are going to Barbie for you now is creating and every time he had the dream you know he just he just he don't worry about it he just come and tell him praise the Lord now you have to realize that he was not giving them that interpretation he was just telling them that I had a dream praise the Lord did he know the interpretation I guess not he just know and remember what he dreamed and he says it to them praise the Lord but now we realize here that uh uh that man has started creating an envied and like brother Branham would say jealousy because of jealousy they had to sell their brother over to to Egypt praise the Lord the same with David David came out and then he's telling his brother how a lion came to take a bed and then he used his slingshot and he got the lion down serious David are you serious a lion praise the Lord and then he coming back again again another time and and uh and and then he's telling his brothers how a bear you know was taking one of his little lamb and then he used his slingshot and then he got the bed down praise the Lord now whether you know the brothers are thinking about uh yeah maybe he had a good dream maybe he's just dreaming you know and all of that but uh uh uh David was going through these experiences amen he was the woman and and and and as we looked back and look into the story we can sit here and read the scripture and we can say God was dealing with him in the infancy of his gift which of course he he too never understood praise the Lord maybe he's having this complex why are they not believing me where I lie to you why why are you guys smoking at me like that praise the Lord maybe he's having this struggle but uh I mean they've been all the older than him they know what a lion is so are you trying to say that you are a lot of something praise the Lord and then you know in in all of that but we will see there there because they then now believe his testimony when Goliath presented himself and David took food to his brothers his brothers were the first one to count him out praise the Lord amen because they did not believe his the testimony about his experience on the backside of the desert because Joseph Brothers they met uh uh believe his dreams or take it to be a spiritual dream and prayed about it they they plot to get rid of him praise the Lord amen the plot to get rid of him now you see the thing when you look at it uh the picture I want for us to see here is that is their brothers they lost their brother even uh uh uh Ruben the firstborn he asked no we should not kill our brother unless he got him out of the hole maybe let's sell him you know so you see the thing there is there it was not there they hated their brother there was a spiritual gift that they did not understand praise the Lord how can a man that is born of an illegitimate parents Open the Eyes of a blind the Pharisees cannot come to term to be able to accept it praise the Lord it was a spiritual gift and it was God that was moving in the midst of his people are we together so brother Abraham says sometimes some of your own household will be the ones that will discourage you first when you are claiming God's promise for yourself praise the Lord and just like it's in the natural also us in a spiritual our our our world uh uh our our genetics and all of those things we are born from our parents you know with Father you know the 23 chromosomes here and there when that new birth comes in praise the Lord it's very strange to our human nature we have all of our crisis because of a strange seed that is in US we have all the wars that we go through praise the Lord there is something Supernatural that is birth in the heart of the believer that I was seeing for nature cannot contend with praise the Lord a man's anime are the ones of his own household praise the Lord we see it all down through through the scripture where you can look at it all there in history you know what I said as I was looking at they say I mean there were just a lot of thoughts that was going through my mind just like I said yeah I mean you you read about the Holocaust and and watch some of the things that that took place there I mean uh and and the anime knows that he can be able to use that whenever he can get the wounds of our own house to turn against us praise the Lord amen I mean if we were testified about the Lord and then live a life contrary to our testimony how we expect the people to believe amen how we expect the ones that we are we are testifying to to believe they will not only believe our words they are looking at our life praise the Lord and they have always been like that David said in the psalm I got some few verses I know down yet I want to read through them quickly Psalm 41 verse 9. he said yeah my own family of friends in whom I trusted which did eat my bread I lifted up his Heat against me but thou O Lord be merciful unto me praise the Lord we see David saying that but we know that he's also speaking on the prophecy praise the Lord Psalm 55 for it was not an anime that reproached me then I could have bought it neither was a he that hated me that that uh magnify himself against me then I will have held myself from him but it was but it was death and man mind equal my God and my acquaintance praise the Lord you can see they are right in the prophecy the Fulfillment there with Judas being a very one one that was counted among the twelve praise the Lord and all the people that are saying all of this nasty thing about Christianity now's the thing about the message of people that sat in the Pew just like you and myself praise the Lord you see that's the reason why I'm saying they're talking life we must not take it for church membership if we don't come to that place word Christ is the center we really have the Revelation is not just a head knowledge but it's a revelation just like Paul said is no longer either liveth but it's Christ that is living in me if the word If the message don't become that to you like I said before is just a period of time it's just a period of time are we together but it was the other man money equal my God my acquaintance we talked sweet Council together and walk into the house of God in company but he's the very same one that reproaches me praise the Lord we can sing the songs of Zion like we said the very ones that say hosanna Hosanna was the same ones that said crucify him God has sent his word to be able to get his children home amen Amen brother Ben I mean the church age book he would say is this he says now we can see why there were two Vine one Vine uh uh one truth and one force now we can see why Abraham had two sons one after the flesh they are persecuted Isaac and one and one after the promise praise the Lord amen Paul says uh henceforth we know no man after the flesh praise the Lord so it's not how much a person says I believe the message or how much a person can give their attendance is how much you are Standing on the Promises how much you are taking these promises to deal with your situations man God is not counting his numbers by the flesh of men that I gather together amen he's looking at his promise brother Branham says now we can see why there were two Vines the force Vine and the True Vine we can see why Abraham Abraham had two sons one after the flesh they are persecuted Isaac and one after the promise now we can see how that out out of the same parent two boys came forth as twins one knowing and loving the things of God and the other knowing much of such truth but not of The Same Spirit and hence persecuted the child that was elected praise the Lord I will say this and I'm trying to say it to be able to encourage all of you young people praise the Lord amen because we are we are we are born around the message and we uh you know we are gathered by Godly Parents and that encourage us to go to church and we do all of these things you know is is so easy for you to take that as the Holy Ghost but I'll tell you it's a religious spirit it's a religious spirit until you come to a birth amen until you come to a birth until that word is able to bring all your inner desires your inner struggles that we don't see until that word is able to bring it in subjection praise the Lord I read that story to you before about John Westlake how he had a golly mother Susanna Wesley his father was a preacher and how he grew in the home and his his mom was his first uh Sunday school teacher and she taught her children praise the Lord until the honors too when Mama take take her apron and put it over her face she was praying and she never wanted noise and those children will sit and wait until Mama take her apron down from her face that was how how much reference that they had but John after that I mean he went to school and then uh uh he was he was even uh ordained as a priest praise the Lord he was invited to Georgia he was invited to Georgia to come and preach to an Indian group it was on his way to Georgia I think when he was returning back that he sat with some Germans praise the Lord amen and then when those men started talking about life in Christ and he started talking about uh uh uh the new breath and experience with God that John Wesley realized that he just had a form of godliness praise the Lord amen amen and then he went back home and and and and and he was praying and asking God and uh you know and then looking through all of his life after all of this went to school and you know I'm I'm a priest offer of a chopper you know he was preaching doing Evangelistic of work and yet he never even had and the spirits of the new birth praise the Lord just driving by a religious spirit there's a there's a scripture in the Bible that uh that was very very John Wesley used that all and were very very significant to him because after that experience he went back and reading his Bible where Jesus says you are not far from the kingdom that scripture just came alive to John that you can do all of those things and come so close to the kingdom praise the Lord let these very people waiting for their Messiah waiting for their deliverer they use the very scripture reading the psalm and the persecute the very one that they were waiting for how many times we use our own attitude and we destroy ourselves praise the lord we use our little religious knowledge and we kick ourselves far from the promise of God because we don't want to wait on God we want to make things happen praise the lord we can go right into the info base of the message and just put a word and bring all the quotes out and you can know all the costs on the subject but yet without a birth you will go far away from the promise a man's own enemy are the names of his house praise the Lord amen this uh this birth This Life of Christ must bring it must bring joy to us it is it must be our life it's not something that we put on and put off praise the Lord amen we put it on when when when when we when we are happy and then when things seems not to make sense to all we can throw it off at any time and then we put up an attitude [Music] praise the Lord Paul says be not deceived God is Not mocked amen if you saw to the Flesh of the flesh you're going to read praise the Lord amen if you saw to the Flesh of the flesh you're going to reap if you are not feeding on the word amen the prophet said Rapture it Faith are on those steps if you are not getting yourself into the message you are just holding on to some kind of for historical knowledge or historical idea of oh that's the way we used to do it or I remember when this was happening it's not going to help you in time like this praise the Lord just like I said on Wednesday night the Church of the Living God is supposed to be on the offense but it looks like we we we feel happy being on the defense praise the Lord let me let me just finish with this quote and since we have a convenience service tonight now we can see how they're out of the same parents two boys came forth as twins one gnawing and loving the things of God and the other Nori much of the same truth Nori much of the same truth praise the Lord but he cannot just come to a life of surrender knowing the truth but cannot just come to a life of surrender praise the Lord but not of the same spirit and hence persecuted a child that was elected god with for the sake of the of reprobation he reprobates for the sake of the elect illit cannot persecute foreign [Music] praise the Lord amen you know every time we we read this and we say Amen to the words whenever whenever we say Amen to the word you know what happened in that place you are the illit foreign I'm not saying you shouldn't say Amen to the word praise the Lord yeah I'm just I'm just speaking from from uh from a common human habit you you you it takes right into your mind and and sometimes you you are you are you are immediately addressing something that you know that is happening right praise the Lord I will reserve my coming and continue to preach the elect cannot persecuted it is to reprobate that persecute and destroy the illit all those reprobates are religious very smart amen now I think the other time I was talking here then uh I was I was dwelling in the same thought you know every word where there are Paul will use that word uh uh and and that's exactly what brother Branham got his inspiration when he preached uh uh uh entity spirit you know which of course he underlining the message that in touch in spirit world was intellectual spirit praise the Lord he was talking about intellectual spirit so brother Branham in that series of demonology he talks about how sickness are demons he talks about cancer then tobacco losses and all of these other sickness how they are demons and they come and they feed on the human cells amen and then he went and talked about uh uh uh demonology in the in the spiritual Realm were you in that in that realm he talks about uh evil spirits and all of that honor that message brother Branham would take the the scripture of where Saul when to meet the wish of Indo now there's demonology in the spirit ring okay then demonology in a religious room brother Brandon will take when uh uh Ahab when it got jealous Shepherd depending on his uh 400 priests that were all the alive spirit to convince this righteous man for them to go and get a line which of course the land was rightly there land was one of the land that was set aside for a City of Refuge but see the picture here people it's now what we are achieving is how we are going about it praise the Lord it's how we are going about it he's Alias here to get a land amen this was the very same person that uh that killed neighbor for his for his father's land you want to set up a a a warrior an invasion to go and redeem that land a man that will now walk that will not honor the Prophet Elijah a man that have got himself married over to uh uh uh an idol princess and her broad idolatry in Israel praise the Lord you see how people will go but they are ready to give their body to be burned [Music] amen they are ready to afflect themselves but when it comes to just submitting ourselves to truth we struggle praise the Lord we struggle we want for God to reveal it again we want for God to speak to us again when God when just one word from the Lord to the heart of the ill that should be be it unto me according to your word amen praise the Lord so brother Branham yet is showing us here how how a religious demons work he says yeah that you know he how all of these men yeah the five men they are studying the Lord but a lying Spirit Rosa he said I would deceive those men praise the Lord they were not quoting something different from the Torah they were looking right into the Lord of Moses they could prove by every point that that land belonged to Israel but yet they will honor a wrong spirit are we together honor honor the uh demonology honor a spiritual realm is showing how Saul will not listing told the prophet Samir he will not take instruction he have his mindset he's going to do what he wants to do now he can no longer hear from the tour uh urinary terming God can no longer speak unto him so he had to go and find medium the very men that web out witchcraft from the land he had to go and look for one he had to disguise himself right if you are doing the right thing why should you disguise yourself praise the Lord we must be able to walk with our conviction amen our conviction must be our bash that we are wearing amen the prophet of God said if your heart is condemning you he says leave it forget about it pray about it if you are not convinced that's the right thing you are doing then just leave it for now pray about it don't expect God to make your wrong right because you say God I'm your child because I'm your child you must do it for me he must not make our wrongs right amen he can Deliver Us from the wrong praise the Lord so yeah he's showing us all of these things he's showing us all of these things let's close on this now let's uh trying to find a place to close here so he says here the elite cannot persecute and heal it will be a reporbid that will persecute and destroy those he says and those reprobates are religious they are smart they are all the king-line serpency line he says they bill they build their cities they can build their Empires and all the why calling on God they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even in the name of the Lord to destroy God's illiter but what did he says let's read that together but they are needed so we need him amen we need them to criticize us praise the Lord they are needed we need them to criticize us we need him to uh to uh to to speak something about the message we can go back to the word and search it out not just feeling from things on the internet but you can take those things go back to the message you will check it out amen but they I need it praise the Lord so when we look at we take the the triumphant entry of Jesus into Jerusalem we look at the Palm Sunday as the religious word all around the world are all you know into rejoicing just keeping history in their mind about the word in our day praise the Lord the word in present tense the word before us the word that you have believed praise the Lord amen amen are you writing that word on the Donkey amen are you carrying that word and saying Hosanna or are you suppressing the word and trying to have your own will praise the Lord the musicians can come while we try to find a place to close here Jesus as he speaks to uh [Music] to his disciples you read over there in Luke chapter 19 a whole lot of that he said Let's uh let's go back here then and uh let's take a verse or two from Luke chapter 19. and we find a place to close here [Music] that was what we read on uh Wednesday night the Bible says from verse 28 to 38 the Bible says saying bless it be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the Pharisees from a more the multitude said unto him Master rebuked their disciples quiet we don't want the the Romans to hear this and he answered and said unto them I tell you that if this you hold their peace the stones will immediately cry out [Music] praise the Lord and when he have come there then he beheld the city he wept over a saying if thou have known even thou at least in this thy day praise the Lord if they have known let's think about this praise the Lord amen let's think about this you think about this just before we pray [Music] if there have known even at least in this that day the things which belonged to that peace forget about uh you know the the the the Jews the children of Israel but just think about just think about what is before us this your day this day that we are living in the thing that is given to us they're supposed to bring peace in our home peace in our life [Music] praise the Lord are we making use of it of it the thing that is given to you for your peace Jesus said but now they are HID from that eyes you know what happened here when Paul speaks in Romans about blindness happen in part to the Jews right here Jesus is proclaiming he's he's prophesying you shall go blind you will not see it [Music] is hidden from your eyes [Music] so he's prophesying he's in their Kingdom that are bringing a indignant on that on the Jews for rejecting the word the thing that is given to you for your peace and I think that's what this Christ should be unto us I think that's what this message should be unto us it's not something that we can join is giving to us to bring peace in our homes peace in our lives [Music] are we seeing the word in a way that is given to us all we are seeing the word in the way that we want to see it [Music] praise the Lord May Christ have the preeminence in our life amen may he have the preeminence in our life [Music] because we are coming to that same place Church of the Living God since we are coming down their same place the pyramid is becoming to teen up the crowd are falling away [Music] the son of man Ministry is to introduce Jesus Christ [Music] a people where he can find preeminence in and I want to say that I I believe this by God's grace that's why we as a church we must be striving for praise the Lord the people that can build this assembly are the people that are here the people whose hearts are here and the Very people that can destroy the assembly are the ones that are also Among Us it takes it it depends on the attitude that you take for the man's anime I want of his own house when we will do things to bring reproach against the word and we will do things and set among unbelievers and people and and and and talk about things that we don't know about [Music] praise the Lord [Music] May Christ have the entrance in our heart this afternoon and we say hosanna Hosanna and blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord amen that while Hosanna May save us save us O Lord [Music] a Man's enemy is the member of his house amen what do we say about Christ whose son is he what do we say about the message of the hour what do we think about it praise the Lord what do we think about it what do we think that we do in in this in this little little assembly are we just are we just making another church no we want to live up the name of Jesus we want him to have the preeminence we want for the world to be made flesh in US is that your desire amen Isaiah desired Church is they say your desire for the world to be made flesh in you amen [Music] I pray that the Lord will help each and every one of us amen that he will help each and every one of us you bring us to a place of birth a place of manifestation the prophet of God says when we become convinced then we will be concerned amen let's bow our house together now [Music] foreign [Music] and renew the right Spirit Within Me [Music] a clean heart oh God Aaron you the right Spirit Within Me [Music] created [Music] alive oh Lord and renew the right Spirit Within Me cast me that away from that presence oh Lord

home are we creating a conversation that is that is making Christ that is casting a cloud for our children to even understand what we believe how are we living up Jesus are we giving him the preeminist are we using the word to solve our conflict that's why we give the children confidence in the word [Music] thank you remember brother Brandon in that this generation for crucifying Jesus [Music] crucifying the laws as fresh the second time [Music] and what he said it was leaving the word rejecting the word and holding on to creeds holding on to traditions of men making the word of no effect [Music] people this is the word of the the the Creator himself the word out created the Heaven and Earth is able to change us it's able to set us free from wrong habits if we are whole into the word if we are taking the word the word can set us free the word can make us an overcomer [Music] it's able to take bitterness it's able to take indifferences from our hearts he is able to take a calm and jealous it is able to take anything that is contrary the word [Music] Heavenly Father Lord realizing that God we are we are down to such a Time Lord such a time of God in such an age your father
