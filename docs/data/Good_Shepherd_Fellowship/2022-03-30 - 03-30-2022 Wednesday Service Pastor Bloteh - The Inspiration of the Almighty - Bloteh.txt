thank the lord for for bringing us together tonight we bring uh greetings from the the few brothers we we visited there in the in the dc area just went to to be of a little help and uh and also to encourage the saints there so uh we we are so grateful that we can have the opportunity to to come back in the house of the lord that that would be all for the music tonight praise the lord thank you thank you musicians amen amen we we just thank the lord and uh [Music] saw the follow the service wins on sunday but then speaking on trust trusting the lord uh even when it is the difficult thing to do and as i was listening to the other i just thought i said well i mean trusting god is is is a difficult thing to do praise the lord it's not it's not as is not easy that we have to trust him when it's difficult to trust him i believe that [Music] the scripture says his mercy is renewed every morning and the renewing of god's mercy unto us god renewed his mercy for us to trust him and he gave us different opportunity every day if you if you just if you just observe the dealing of the law with you you realize that god will give us different opportunity to see how much we trust him praise the lord amen and it's it's strange because i was i was studying on the on the weekend speaking there in dc uh actually was uh uh speaking a little bit on on leadership but i was taking uh jaitum parable in the book of george's spoke on that year a long time many years ago but jaton parable after his brother abimelech killed all the sons of jeruba which is gideon and a little jaitan was able to escape and then he went on the hill and he yelled down to the people and shashi and he said the trees went out to find a leader and they went to the olive tree and says come and rule over us praise the lord that's georges chapter nine maybe you can read that when you get home come and root over us and uh and and and the olive tree said uh no i don't want to leave uh my service to god and my service to men you'll find that in the in the in the parable of jaden it was it was very very amazing to to see that and then they went also over to the uh to the fig tree and uh and the factory signal no yeah i don't want to lose my sweetness then the trees went to to the vine and the vine says what i know i'm serviceable to god i'm serviceable to man and then the trees went to the brom bomb and the brown bone says well if you will want me to rule over you then you will have to trust so i was actually studying on the word trust you have to trust honor mine my wings you have to trust yourself to me but the the amazing thing there is that the brown bone does not have no shade because it's a tongue tree it's just cut all over the place you know it don't have no shade but yet it's asking the rest of the trees to trust themselves on him and and and that world trust is uh uh um it has a characteristics in the in the old testament is used is used many times in in many places trust in the law with all your heart lean on to your own understanding laying that on to your own understanding and it's it's used but there are four words that are that are used yet over in uh ruth chapter 2 verse 12 the word trust is is used to find refuge praise the lord i read it in that wrote two scriptures down so let me just look at it quickly i will just read in there so let me just look at it quickly tonight and we have to remember i mean every day you know whether it's going to be because of of of finance or is going to be because of a job what is going to be because of whatever the law want us to trust him everything that we are experiencing in our life sometimes uh you know we we we turn to make our daily life we turn to think that we having a separate christian life from our our natural or our normal life every part of our life the brother branham says god is interested in the least things that concern us praise the lord the listing that concerns us even how you lay your head on the pillow to sleep god is interested in it praise the lord so every every form of our life every avenue uh ruth chapter 2 verse 12 the lord recompense thy work this is speaking to ruth bohr speaking to ruth he says and a full reward be giving thee of the lord god of israel all know whose wings thou i come to trust so trust in the lord we must be able to trust him that we can take refuge he's teaching us so we can be able to take refuge we can be able to the bible says the name of the lord is is a mighty tower that the righteous run into it and they are safe praise the lord psalm chapter 56 verse 3 also use the word trust but he used the word trust praise the lord and in the way that david used it here 56 3 praise the lord in the way that david used it here he says be merciful verse one be merciful unto me oh god for man who's swallowing up his fighting daylight of uh he he's fighting there it oppresses me my enemy will dearly swallow me up for they be mighty that fight against me all all doubt most high what time i i am afraid i would trust indeed amen and now he's talking about an enemy yet and he's talking about you know uh uh his enemy you know warring against him and he's using the word i would trust in the year it has the sense of leaning on the lord amen like we're seeing the son leaning on his everlasting end so when we when we when we need a lord to to to lean on we need someone to lean on we can trust him amen he will be there he's not going to shift for us to fall praise the lord you know i've i read i read a story to you one time brother branham talk talk about that also he says this woman said i heard a hair to the saddle until you know uh the rope cut or whatever the belt caught brother branham says uh uh she said no the statement is i trusted the lord until you know what whatever she was holding there on her hearse she said until it cut brother branham says no you should have trusted the lord after a card because you have something to hold her you are actually holding to that thing amen he says it's after when there is nothing to hold on then you can trust in the lord amen so we can go through all of that uh and uh a different different scripture here um is is it's the same word that that takes another sense of faith in the new testament praise the lord our faith in god is our trust in him amen but it's good to be back home and uh uh that's the the saints there send their greetings and uh uh but let's stand on our feet tonight and and we will just take a little portion in the world before we we uh praise the lord by the way of an announcement like we said that we would not have a communion service this first sunday we are looking forward to the the the easter weekend uh if the lord uh uh tarry and uh and believing that he will bless it for us we will will be able to to have communion that we can believe in their brother robert wilson he's he's a minister brother over in the in the chicago illinois area he just returned back from chad a missionary brother and we trust him and hoping that he will be with us that we can praise the lord so let's go to second kings chapter four we've been dwelling in ii kings chapter four for the wine talking about uh the inspiration of the almighty let's read from verse 32. ii king chapter 4 let's read from verse 32. and when elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed upon elisha's bed he went in therefore and shot the door upon them twins and he prayed unto the lord and he went up and laid upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hand upon his hand and he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child walks warm then he return and and walk in the house toward and fall and went up and stretch himself upon him and the child sneezed several times and the child eyes the child opened his eyes sorry and he called geheza and said call the shimonite so he called her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out amen heavenly father dear lord it's been a while lord we have we have endured on this chapter of the bible and precious holy spirit father god because we see uh a type year and in in the scripture father god word and we believe we are living in in such a time lord father where the the bride of jesus christ this gentile bride that this woman this shaming a woman type in the bible father lord god we believe this is our our lord our time where this church lord father this bride must be living by the breath of god this church must be living honor the spirit of inspiration lord not living by our own thoughts oh god father and what we think and what we feel and we feel like and we don't feel like but god father is the our lord god where the people of god must be driven by the spirit of inspiration because it's the breath of god it's the life of god that dwell in us so father just like the old god father lord is written in your word in you we move we breathe and we have our being so we ask tonight lord come come and just take lord father this portion of the word and then and help us tonight lord i commit myself into your hands for speaking and the people father lord god for hearing tonight oh lord what the spirit will have us to say so lord just come or father as you blessing your people around the world remember us lord father meteors are the very point of our spiritual needs physical needs health wise as well in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen praise the lord praise the lord amen so just just like uh uh we was sharing with you a little bit we were talking there the uh fellowshipping with the saints and we were we were speaking on leadership that way and uh uh so we took those four trees uh and and and if you realize and you go back and read the scripture you will see that uh each one of those trees the the olive tree the fig tree the involuntary in first instance all of those tree has very significance to israel and and and they also have significance to to to the people to the people of god and uh [Music] but what what uh what caught my attention uh as as i was as i was studying uh and reading the edits that all of those trees were able to identify that they have a service to god and to man praise the lord it's very beautiful because most of the time we think about serving god and we want to be a service to god and and and sometimes we think uh uh is is you know is is by preaching to the people it's all part of faith and we think you know uh is is uh is by just breaking in the spirit and doing all of these spiritual things but you will realize that every true service to god is to his people praise the lord brother branham says when we self humanity spoken word is the original seed he says you are serving god any service to humanity is a service to god praise the lord can you imagine how many people have the opportunity to serve all of those refugees that are running from ukraine people open their homes people try to bring them water and and all of that and and and these are some of the things since of god you think about some of the things that we gave some people internal reward praise the lord we're thinking about the service of god we think about great missionary work there are people that are called to do that like this brother i was talking about brother robert wilson he's like a kind of a one-man army you know he he raised his own funds and then he goes to parts of the world where there is really not not really the message church is and he goes there and try to work he goes to other places where they are message church put them together you know encourage the pastor you know feed the people for for for uh three service uh a weekend friday saturday sunday night and you know and all of that and you know and people do different things but just just think out of the box of uh church service preaching the word or giving out tracts you know there are people that will be blessed with internal reward because of their service to humanity praise the lord and uh you know i think about those things uh you know think about it and just and just sometimes become emotional when i watch all the different things that are happening there praise the lord amen glory be to god so that's that was the thing that caught my attention on that scripture that parable of jolting you know the trees wanting a ruler over them but yet the one that you know that wanted to do the work or that thing that he was qualified the brown bone he don't the brow bone don't bear no fruit they don't have a fruit like i said they don't even have a shade you know brother branham restoration is the bright tree of the bride tree he said the shade is for fellowship you know so the brown bone don't even have that it's just only good for destruction only good for fire yes and that's exactly what jacob said to them the brown bone said trust yourself honor me praise the lord amen he says and then if if you if you break that trust i will burn you i would turn the whole city on on fire that was exactly what uh uh abimelech did uh but then there was there was another beautiful piece in that scripture uh and the beautiful piece was it took a little woman the bible did not even give us her name it took a little woman to bring an end to to to the foolishness of abimelech kill all his brothers just because of power force himself on the people of shashin with with uh with uh with political talks but it took a little woman the bible says she took a stone he was a feminine david she took a stone and broke the score of abimelech praise the lord so we were talking speaking about god is never without a witness he's never without a witness he will use strange people in difficult times amen praise the lord he will use strange people in difficult times and i believe that god has called us each and every one of us for us to be vessels of honor he have called us for us to be vessels that he can use and you know the amazing thing about god he don't put you on schedule just like your work will put you on schedule he wants you to be available he wants you to be available for any given time praise the lord and like the prophet of god said he says when when you are available at a time that god wants to use you when you are available for a divine movement but better in the message he says it is just like eating honey from the skull of a lion when you know that you have just done something it was the right thing you were at the right place at the right time he says it the feeling is just like eating honey out of the squad of a lion that was what samson did he killed the lion and went his way and the bees came and make honey right in the skull of the lion at the time he was hungry the very lion he killed was able to provide food for him and the prophet also says when you just realize that you have missed it he said what a horrible feeling when you just realize that god has given you an opportunity to be a blessing an opportunity to be a witness and you blew it he says what a horrible feeling yes praise the lord i wish i was in poland to run to the border i know what it is because i've been in the world zone before so but i'm not there i'm right here in minneapolis i have to watch out what is going to be my own opportunity i have to watch out i have to be very sensitive praise the lord is when you have come to the place to live a life word god has delivered you a little bit from selfishness some of the the reason why we miss those opportunities because we go the whole day thinking about one person safe how am i going to do this how am i going to do dad how am i going to do and then sometimes we just walk right past an opportunity that will have made the father to say yes my boy selfishness can imprison you so that was one of the one of the things i drove from that scripture out of those trees they have quality in them to save god and to save man but that's not what i'm preaching on tonight that's not what i'm preaching on tonight praise the lord exodus 21 exodus chapter 21 let's read verse one praise the lord exodus chapter 21 let's read verse one it's just a prayer night good to see you brother joel uh how was your drive down to iowa i mean it was good praise the lord praise the lord praise lord exodus chapter 21 let's read verse one did i say 21 no 22. exodus 22. exodus 22 verse 1 if a man shall steal an ox or a sheep and kill it listen very closely now this is a commandment of the lord you got to listen very closely if a man shall steal an ox or a sheep and kill it or sell it he shall restore five oxen for an ox if he's an ox he should he must restore five praise the lord amen and if you even read down you realize that if the man is caught then he have to double pay if he's caught stealing yeah praise the lord but let's let's stay with this and four sheep for a sheep praise the lord he must restore if he's an oxen on an ox that he's told he must he must restore five but if he's a sheep he must restore fall praise the lord and we can say this is doubt said the lord because this is this is an instruction from the prophet moses praise the lord but then you'll realize that when david was in his ordeal the the beautiful thing there is that when when when uh when uriah's died in uh second samuel 11 when uriah's died and job sent a message to david you know what he told david he reminded david about the woman that killed abimelech it's amazing it's amazing that's not what i'm talking about tonight let me stay let me stay on this it's amazing that he reminded david he said go and tell david we have lost the world he and if he asks you how did this happen say to him was it not a woman well let's stay right here now so when david got into his problem the prophet netan received a word from the lord to go and talk to david so nathan the prophet got on his way maybe he took a straw and under his arm and he was walking and everybody knew when they saw the prophet coming they knew that this was serious and when nelton got there to david he said king i'm here to see you the king said you can have your seat abil i sure believe that david was trouble because he have seen the prophet he says i have a problem in uh he says there is a problem in this kingdom and and david says what is said and nathan said there is a poor man that have one sheep now so what the prophet mitten is doing by inspiration he's taking what the prophet moses said praise the lord amen he's taking exodus 22 the entire story that nelton bill told david was exodus 22 verse 1. sure are we together so he's taking their honor inspiration to be able to draw to be able to capture david praise the lord now being the prophet and whatever the lord has revealed to him yes yeah my my seven has done wrong he he has killed you riots and then and and then go on to him and you know and and here is nathan here using the very words of the prophet moses and what he's doing is that he's going to preach preach a message honor inspiration but he going to dramatize it amen he's going to dramatize it in a way where david will feel comfortable to even say amen praise the lord amen you know you hear those people preach it sometimes it's just on a guilt sometimes it's just on a guilt so uh uh a net one year now he says there is there is a rich man in it and and there's a paul manning and he takes the the poor man only sheep on the line he had praise the lord and as he's saying that david is getting off of his sh off of his seat he's not captured by what nathan is telling him but what was the prophet nathan doing he was under inspiration to be able to bring david to a conviction and he was going to use the word of the lord to breathe life into david dead body because david was dead because that's why he said the men have done this that man should die that's what inspiration is is the breath of god it's the breath of god praise the lord david stood up pre-checked the man i've done it that man was died and nathan said you are the man praise the lord he said you are the man glory be to god can you imagine where david was after hearing the prophet saying you are the man and if you you even read the scripture there in the in uh in chapter 12 you'll realize david said the man that have done this must restore fall forth he asked that the man should die and he also asked that the man should restore because he knew what the law says he knew what the court of of of uh of uh of moses said right praise the lord and i i i can show you different places in the scripture where this play out but what i want to bring you to is the other you see the bible says there is no scripture that is written you know by by private interpretation amen no scripture is written by private interpretation that's what that's what the scripture says amen holy men were inspired amen they were inspired i want to get this get this right so read it to you all scriptures are given by inspiration of god and it's profitable for doctrine and we said doctrine is what is right amen is profitable for reproof all scripture is profitable to help you and is profitable for reproof what is not right praise the lord is profitable for correction how to get it right an instruction how to stay right yes that's what god gave his word for but it's the breath of god that's what inspiration is the word inspiration means the breath of god we we read uh brother branham on there if i can be able to just drop back it a little bit and when we start this blasphemer name the church is a mystical body born by the breath of god did you get it the church of god is born by the breath of god uh god god breathed into the nostril spiritually of adam and he became a living soul did you know the pentecostal the true pentecostal church was born by the breath of god when that when that uh wind blew into the upper room amen yes when you know that the mighty wing that came into the opera room that's what brother branham is referring to now you you can think about it those people they were all scared to death because uh uh uh uh the the pharisees the sahendra's council has already make a plan and wrote a story in the newspaper that they have stolen the body of jesus christ to be able to prove the claim that he was raising from the dead right praise the lord so i believe they were looking at the case so uh you know to be able to judge it and then pretty soon they will start arresting those disciples they were all you know in the upper room waiting on the promise but it was scared to death but what happened when their mighty rushing wind came right into the upper room and breathed upon them the bible said brother brown said peter took a soapbox the man i was a friend and i was denying jesus i don't even know him he took a soap bus right in the middle of town praise the lord so you see that the breath of god took him from fear blew all his fear away amen he's not ashamed to testify that i'm a believer i'm a christian i can't do this i you know he's not he's not afraid praise the lord that's what the inspiration of the almighty will do praise the lord you know you know you know at what time the church you you look through church history and you look through the scripture you see it all the time it have been in desperate moment brother branham said uh uh you bear with me tonight uh i'm just i'm running back from one one thing one to another so uh i might not have things up there for you tonight but says look in spiritual inspiration he says look i'm trying to say that the woman was inspired and inspired people through all ages are strange to the world but they are always doing god's will it was a strange thing that paul taking handshakes off of his body in april and send them to sick and afflicted people now so you see it's not something that is premeditated amen inspiration is not something that it that is premeditated it's something that strucks you from the inside and when it strikes you it takes over your being praise the lord david going to meet goliath it was not premeditated because he went to take food to his brothers but when he heard he heard goliath bringing an insult on the living god praise the lord it just overtook him and you see that little boy running out there there looking for rocking and running out it was inspiration it was not it was not all he had a testimony how he killed a lion he had a testimony of how he came to bed but that moment was not a moment that he prepared for it was inspiration that took him praise the lord for him to go and face the giant of their day a man that was well trained praise the lord so you see inspiration has always has always possessed the church in a time where you don't think about it you don't plan for it praise the lord look at the shimmy now woman she was just about to enjoy her son after she had waited for him many years and then you know on on the field and and and all of that and i mean the boys say oh my head my head come and come junior come and sit on my leg right there the ball die so right in that moment in that dying movement now the reason why this is important or uh i'm kind of for lingering on this is because i believe that uh you know i believe the church i believe the bride is moving right into that hour praise the lord after coming from under you know a global coronavirus uh you know a time and you know in in in people locked down and you know and you know and people started building different theory in their mind michael the beast all sorts of things praise the lord and we know that it's not the end to it we are living in a world where we we we are going from one worst situation to another worse we have not even taken the marks off of our face larry's russia uh uh uh uh uh bombing ukraine we'll know what next will happen praise the lord you see and that's the reason why in this unexpected moment praise the lord in this unexpected moment look at israel before the red sea and behind them they can see the dust of the egyptian cherish in the air praise the lord amen mountains on both sides glory be to god you see that's the reason why as a believer you have to you have we have to make sure that that channel is clean that there is nothing that is stuck in that channel because it's not when you get to that desk oh lord god forgive me my sin oh jesus christ oh how can i meet the sister to make things right how can i meet this brother to make things right that's just that just a religious spirit we must live every day right with god if the sun should not go down on your anger the sun should not go down when you realize that you have displeased the lord the mountains on both sides rescue before them and they can see the egyptian terror they can see the dust coming and the people oh uh uh all of those men that's why we were saying leave us in egypt why you brought us down here i mean they were seeing their death in that in that state of confusion moses under inspiration said the egyptian you see today you will see them no more forever how it will happen he didn't know but on her inspiration he said the egyptian you see today you will see them no more that's what happened because when you have that channel you allow god to breathe when god speaks to you you can inhale it praise the lord and then you can exhale it again you are not afraid to express it because you know that's god's word [Music] the inspiration the almighty job said that's what gives wisdom the inspiration of the almighty give it wisdom praise the lord look through the bible look at when joshua says son standstill that was not a premeditated thing he had a life of these people on his hands they were not playing games it was not high and sick they were playing they were fighting the battle praise the lord and when he had gone down the road that uh not a place that he has that he was familiar with he needed a son to be in that position to make sure that we finish with this battle praise the lord amen you know what it was going to be if joshua would have just gone there and says hey kill it and uh joseph you're coming home my hands up you remember what we did for moses yo you're coming home my hands up he will have been impersonating god don't back impersonation see you're coming hold my hands up you you remember when we had moses hands on and we won up no he was right in the fight with his sword drawn he was ready for for business he was in the fight he was not high oh god watch what i do oh lord jesus what should i do lord you are able lord you are able look just eating with fear praise glory be to god he was in a fight he said son stand still i'm out here for business tonight he never even said it and said well let me see if he's standing no he just said it and went straight to work he said it and went straight to work but brahms said you don't put the c there and go deacon says is it is he has it gemmatized yet some of our attitudes are the greater hindrance to our prayers because we don't trust the one we are talking to if you trust him you give it to him he never even said give it he said cassid he said cassette cast your key at me cassette cassette cassidy don't don't don't be so nice lord jesus i bring my there's my trouble he's been troubling me i gotta give it to you lord you so love your trouble that you can't even cast your trouble i don't know if i should give it to you this thing been bothering me all of my life it didn't bother me all my life that my family problem here i want to give it to you yes sir glory be to god amen it's right honor their brother you're sorry they fight amen glory be to god the inspiration of the almighty that's the breath of god that's the reason why you don't play with the word of god when you are reading the word praise the lord oh my where am i tonight i'm all over the place amen i'm all over the place but it's okay amen praise the lord you love the lord let's uh go to ezekiel chapter 2. ezekiel chapter two i pray that the holy spirit will be able to make this thing more clear to you a girl will be able to deal with you in a special way and make you to realize how much we need inspiration you know like uh uh you know but i remember dan talking about you know how much the breath that we breathe is important amen ezekiel chapter 2 let's look at this principle as a principle here i want for us to look at verse 1 and he said unto men son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak on today and their spirit entered me when he speak unto me and set me upon my feet that i heard him that speak unto me do you see the principle there there's a principle god is speaking to ezekiel and asking him stand on your feet so i can speak to you praise the lord amen now if you take there you will think that it sounds like a command sure amen it sounds like he's giving ezekiel a comment still on your feet so i can speak today but as god is saying that the very command now became the thing that took ezekiel on his feet he then now obey that command by himself but the word that spoke unto him woke him up [Laughter] praise the lord you know it says just like jesus saying to the woman cut in adultery go and sing no more it was not a command he was not giving her a command he was telling her of the present state of her life neither do i condemn thee go and sing no more it does not don't it does not mean don't do it again it means that you will not do it again oh praise the lord you see and that is the place where people struggle they think that brother branham the message has brought a lot of law all the message said this all the message says that walk in the light and more will unfold praise the lord did you grab the principle let's read that again i think i'm almost time here to close let's read that again he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee and the spirit enter into me when he speak unto me as he was speaking unto me the breath of god entered into me as he was speaking and i was hearing him the breath of god entered into me and put me on my feet praise the lord amen everything that god has said in his word his spirit followed it to bring it to pass [Music] with your seat with our sinful nature there is no way we can practice the word of god or the lord of god to get it right oh that's why the prophet isaiah said his word do not go out and return back to him vow the spirit follow the word to bring it to pass but why why why do the world don't come to pass is because you are trying to hemoprocess the word when you try to process the word humanly you are hybrid in the world you are not supposed to process it law how is it going to happen oh yeah no glory be to god and the spirit entered into me when he speak unto me and set me upon my feet it was the spirit that was obeying what god said the spirit woke him up as i was hearing the word that's the breath of god that's what happened when the word is preached and the people are on the expectation they are in the spirit to receive the word praise the lord amen and the preacher comes and evangelically comes and he's rebuking sin and he's calling this thing out and you're not there sitting in the seat of a scum falling and just saying who he think he is and and all of that that's the reason why brother brahm says unbelief only handle the that's unbeliever think about this brother branham said every mortar should have heard the word of god only one time only one time as ariel morton must have the opportunity to hear the word of god one time every mortar it took five minutes in the presence of god yes sir to change moses from a man of temple to the most meekest man five minutes praise the lord when god speak his word just like mary be it unto me i call into that word praise the lord amen she said lord be it unto me i call him to that word that very moment she was conceived that very moment she was conceived praise the lord she was conceived and she never even knew it praise the lord let's read this one more time and then we will find a place to close here glory be to god but i hope i hope you get you get what we try to drive to we are moving in an hour in a day in time an age we are getting tall with everything that is happening around us praise the lord amen it might get to the places well you know i love this salmon book this is my study bible i've on the line my favorite reverses i've highlighted it praise the lord and there might be situations where you might not get back to your study bible praise the lord the purpose of the holy ghost was because god wanted his word to leave the pages of the book to dwarf in you praise the lord and he said unto me son of man stand upon that feet and i will speak on today and the spirit enter into me when he speak unto me and set me upon my feet that i heard him that speak unto me so it was almost before ezekiel realized himself you already standing before he could process what was said to him you were already standing sure upon his feet we're praying a little bit here i was thinking on on something i will talk a little bit on that on sunday if i'm led in that direction but paul in the in the book of ephesians ephesians chapter 6 let's turn there we are closing ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wild of the devil for we rise are not against flesh and blood but against principalities against power against the ruler of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to to to withstand in the evil days and having done all to stand praise the lord just like it took the spirit to follow the word to make the prophet ezekiel stand that's how it would take the spirit to follow the word to follow the message to make a bride to stand in this age until that happened we don't have nothing to be able to stand against the evil that the enemy have all his plots and his plan and everything but as paul goes here to tell us having done all to stand he says stand there for having your lying girls with truth and having your breasts having the breastplate of righteousness the short of your feet now he he sell out of this he gave us all of this which of course we know there are seven uh uh elements he gave here four i mean six of them uh uh are physical elements praise the lord uh uh to be able to give your lyrics the breastplate the righteousness your the your your feet show and the sheet of faith and uh the helmet of salvation the swole which is the word of god sex element a physical element there is a seventh element that he gives where he says [Music] praying always with all prayer and all of the all of all of the elements that he gave their you know uh the the describing and and like like we have said before they are all elements that help a warrior to be able to dress and to protect himself the breastplate is one year the lens year the you know your shoes here your helmet year so the entire front part of this warrior is protected and because most of the time there's the way we think as humans praise the lord i will tell you a very important secret tonight do you know that god put the important organs of our body on our back praise the lord amen sure the importance organ on our body they will tell you when the military is trained they will tell you in the time of war and you get in any kind of a difficult situation you must lay on your face never lay on your back you have to cover your back because any bullet through your back is closer to any of your major organs it will tell them to pull their hands on their chest and lay forward or face up praise the lord because but he ever said yeah that and that's that's the thing young people and that's the reason why the devil fight us to pray he makes you busy he makes you lazy you are either busy or lazy pray for the water because he knows that prayer cover your most vital spiritual element a cover your back praise the lord he knows that even the four beasts around the throne in a way that brother branham described it they are all looking forward one beast looked this way one looked this way one look this way one looked this way they're all looking at the full compass direction but they are looking in that in that direction to be able to cover the back of one another this guy now supposed to look back here because this guy is covering his back and the other guy is covering his back praise the lord the most vital organ is easily reached from the back i'll talk a little bit about the spine on monday on sunday when if the lord lead us in that direction but we are in an hour it's a crucial hour people it's an hour where we have to be sons and daughters like the scriptures say sons of god are led by the spirit of god yes sons and daughters people that are available like the scripture says pray without seizing that's how much that's how much protection we provide for our weaknesses the prophet said sweeten your temple we pray to be able to speak the words of grace it comes to prayer yes sir do you know brother brahms he said those apostles were men of few words they were men of few words it's not because they didn't have anything to say it's because they were constantly living in another dimension they were constantly their spirit was constantly supplicating before god their spirit was constantly supplicated before god say oh god have mercy have that young lady oh god have mercy oh god let's buy our heads tonight the inspiration of the almighty give it wisdom word of god ever truth let's think about that tonight let's buy our hairs together [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] long presents [Music] oh word of god ever true changing me changing you we have come with open eyes let the word of god yes word of god ever true changing me [Music] [Applause] let the word of god oh let's just sing that one more time yeah word of god ever true [Music] hoping [Music] you see a lot of the times we have we are caught up in this religious concept [Music] that jesus said you have to go into your closet lock the doorway and because we spend less time in our homes so we have less time to pray because we have to be at the house we have to go in the room we have to close the door in everything but if you realize that brother abraham said your heart is the throne of mercy the throne has come to the heart of the believer it means that you can pray anywhere and anytime [Music] you can be walking right down the street and have a heart of supplication you can train yourself to pray even in your busy hour but because we are captured in the mind in the church mind i have to go to church on wednesday night so i can pray and even you don't even come on time to pray 10 minutes [Music] but you you you you get that feeling that all because i show up so i was in a prayer meeting tonight oh the prayer meeting was wonderful we have to be hearts of supplication hearts that are that are burdened as you you drive down the road and and the lord puts something on your heart you say oh god lord father i just pray that lord you will just bless my sister be with her lord father i i don't know i just thought about her father wherever she is you can be right in the kitchen you can pray you can be right washing clothes wherever you are you can be right there and you can put your heart [Applause] into a supplication more oh heavenly father tonight breathe upon us lord breathe upon us of god is there anything lord that is stopping the breath of god father we're all god we are just minds i just filled up with a lot of things and little time for you lord our minds just fed up with god with church traditions and all of our lord the father we can can live to that place of being the son of god and the daughter of god father oh god we are coming tonight lord and say breathe for me lord read for me lord let the ancient word impart to god [Music] father just like how the preaching of your word took ezekiel on his feet lord jesus let the ancient world impact tonight oh god oh let just pray together tonight as we put our house before the lord we can protect the important organs of our life the organs of the family the way to be able to protect it is to cover every prayer that is a place that that that that the provision that the apostle paul made for the covering of our back the covering of our weaknesses the place our hands can reach the place we can see verb said we must keep that place on the prayer under the blood because the enemy have a right to that place oh father i pray tonight lord just just pull down though god the spirit of supplication upon the people oh father lord god lord jesus so father where we will learn to pray behind our steering wheels we will learn to pray to god by just going for a walk and speaking to the lord in the early morning we will learn to pray even when our hands are busy lord our minds will be on the lord breathe upon us oh god that's the reason why prayer life is is dead in the church because the people are stuck in traditions when god want to breathe upon us wherever we are whatever we are doing oh god stirred our house lord stirred our hearts so father we become so based and so occupied in our minds our minds become so occupied that we cannot even spend about five minutes before the lord because we are so busy on our mind our hearts cannot be touched that's why we can cry before god because if god moves upon your heart that is the place of your emotion oh father breathe lord into our prayerless life lord pray for god let the inspiration of the almighty o precious lord please sweet jesus please lord oh father we thank you tonight we thank you lord we appreciate your god what a day what an hour lord father how many opportunity lord have we met so god how many divine moments have we passed lord jesus when father lord you wanted to use that moment to breathe upon us lord so we can bring a breath of life for god to the earth so we can breathe upon somebody lord we can be able to send somebody something love that will encourage them or father how many opportunities have we blown oh god because we are so self-centered lord our mind is just all on our knees it's just us and us alone oh father please lord breathe upon me to god breathe upon me lord jesus breathe upon me father lord oh god we thank you tonight lord we thank you tonight oh god we praise your name tonight we glorify you tonight sweet jesus what almighty god you are father lord every praise lord and every glory father god lord belongs to you o god father i pray to god lord o god you will shall love father move the house of your people lord god oh father lord jesus lord god is either we are busy or we are lazy oh god i just pray father lord you will turn our house to lord god we can get on the phone and talk about somebody for hours and hours and hours and not even be able to spend a time with the creator and even commune with him and talk to him oh blessed be your name blessed be your name father we have god with open heart oh let the asian world [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] word of god [Music] [Laughter] [Music] with open hearts let the word of god impart but then you want to come and close us in the word of prayer tonight oh hallelujah jesus breathing me breathe we have come with open hearts let the word of god heavenly father just want to

find a time in sleep in your room or find a place where you can just go and spend a little time with god just say lord i thank you i love you father draw me closer [Music] praise the lord [Music] the bible says in a walk with god what do you think enoch was doing when he was walking he was communing with god he was communing with god if god can be able to bring you to that place [Music] where you can be able to be in a busy place and your heart can be so busy with god [Music] it's it's not something that anybody can do or everybody can do because some people they i mean they lose everything with little distraction as soon as somebody says something yet they want to know who's talking and who's that but for you to be in a busy place and then you are shouting with god that's the believer's position that's the heavenly places times are becoming busier we get a lot of things on our hands to do little time to do it if the devil can just keep you in a religion and say well you got to pray wednesday night go for prayer meeting all you know the bible said jesus said you got to close the window and this there yeah he's the same one that said that and he's the same one that told uh that said through the apostle paul prayer without ceasing he says let men lift up their hands everywhere lift up holy hands the bride is getting into a place the bride is getting into a place where the world is disappearing from her eyes and all the destruction you know everything that uh the enemy is putting out there is is just becoming glad and when she look at everything she see her beloved [Music] stand on our feet and wash it oh jesus draw me close close our all to you for our desire to worship and obey let's sing that to him oh yeah jesus [Applause] [Music] [Applause] me [Music] yes jesus draw me close [Music] closer on to you lord let the word [Music] and jesus draw me closer [Music] you know many times when i hear people say when i used to be at this place oh i used to pray when i used to be at this place or be in africa and all of those things [Music] a prayer life is a life of relationship it's a life that you grow in you grow in a prayer life it's not it's not an exercise no it's a relationship it's something that you grow in so if you if you ever did grow if you ever grow someone that you have a relationship with it does not change it does not change for you to think that oh yeah i thought you know i come to america i'm working now so i'm so busy i can't even pray oh that you did not have a relationship in prayer because if you have a relationship you have a wife you have children even if they lock you up in praising it does not kill your emotion for them the more you are far from them the more you desire them more it's something that we must grow in we must grow in that relationship we must grow just just the same way the devil fight against marriage relationship that's how he fight against a prayer life because he knows that prayer life brings you in an intimate relationship with god [Music] in every relationship you don't you don't start from the top you grow you grow you learn how to talk you learn how you learn how to break into feelings [Music] the lord bless you tonight i desire to wash it and let's sing that one more time we are dismissed oh jesus [Music] and [Music] [Applause] [Music] you you
