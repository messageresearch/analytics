[0:52] by what authority i do these things
[0:56] but what thinky
[0:57] a certain man had two sons
[1:00] and he came to the first and said son go
[1:01] work today in my vineyard
[1:04] he answered and said i will not but
[1:06] after what he repented and went
[1:08] and he came to the second and said
[1:09] likewise and he answered and said i go
[1:12] sir
[1:13] and went not
[1:15] whether of them twain did the will of
[1:17] his father
[1:18] they say unto him the first
[1:21] jesus saith unto them verily i say unto
[1:24] you that the publicans and the harlots
[1:26] go into the kingdom of god before you
[1:29] for john came unto you in the way of
[1:31] righteousness and ye believed him not
[1:33] but the publicans and the harlots
[1:35] believed him
[1:36] and ye when he had seen it repented not
[1:38] afterward that ye might believe him
[1:41] here another parable
[1:43] there was a certain householder which
[1:44] planted a vineyard and hedged it round
[1:46] about and digged a wine press in it and
[1:48] built a tower and let it out to
[1:50] husbandman and went into a far country
[1:53] and when the time of the fruit drew near
[1:55] he sent his servants to the husbandman
[1:57] that they might receive the fruits of it
[1:59] and the husbandman took his servants and
[2:02] beat one and killed another and stoned
[2:04] another
[2:06] again he sent other servants more than
[2:07] the first and they did unto them
[2:09] likewise
[2:11] but last of all he sent unto them his
[2:13] son saying they will reverence my son
[2:16] but when the husbandmen saw the sun they
[2:18] said among themselves this is the air
[2:21] come let us kill him and let us seize on
[2:23] his inheritance and they caught him and
[2:25] cast him out of the vineyard and slew
[2:27] him
[2:28] when the lord therefore of the vineyard
[2:30] cometh
[2:31] what will he do unto those husbandmen
[2:35] they say unto him
[2:36] he will miserably destroy those wicked
[2:38] men and will let out his vineyard unto
[2:40] other husband men which shall render him
[2:42] the fruits in their seasons
[2:44] jesus saith unto them
[2:47] did ye never read in the scriptures
[2:49] the stone which the builders rejected
[2:52] the same as become the head of the
[2:53] corner
[2:55] this is the lord's doing
[2:57] and it is marvelous in our eyes
[3:01] therefore say i unto you the kingdom of
[3:03] god shall be taken from you and given to
[3:05] a nation bringing forth the fruits
[3:07] thereof
[3:08] and whosoever shall fall on this stone
[3:10] shall be broken but on whomsoever it
[3:12] shall fall
[3:14] it will grind him to powder
[3:18] and when the chief priests and pharisees
[3:19] had heard his parables they perceived
[3:22] that he spake of them
[3:24] but when they sought to lay hands on him
[3:26] they feared the multitude because they
[3:29] took him for a profit
[3:47] and jesus answered and spake unto them
[3:49] again by parables and said the kingdom
[3:51] of heaven is like unto a certain king
[3:53] which made a marriage for his son and
[3:55] sent forth his servants to call them
[3:57] that were bitten to the wedding
[3:59] and they would not come
[4:01] again he sent forth other servants
[4:03] saying tell them which are bitten behold
[4:05] i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my
[4:08] fatlings are killed and all things are
[4:10] ready come on to the marriage
[4:12] but they made light of it and went their
[4:14] ways one to his farm another to his
[4:16] merchandise and the remnant took his
[4:19] servants and entreated them spitefully
[4:21] and slew them
[4:23] but when the king heard thereof he was
[4:25] wrath
[4:26] and he sent forth his armies and
[4:28] destroyed those murderers and burned up
[4:30] their city
[4:32] then saith he to his servants the
[4:34] wedding is ready but they which were
[4:35] bidden were not worthy go ye therefore
[4:38] into the highways and as many as ye
[4:40] shall find bid to the marriage
[4:43] so those servants went out into the
[4:44] highways and gathered together all as
[4:46] many as they found both bad and good and
[4:49] the wedding was furnished with guests
[4:51] and when the king came in to see the
[4:53] guests he saw there a man which had not
[4:55] on a wedding garment and he saith unto
[4:57] him friend how came as thou and hither
[4:59] not having a wedding garment
[5:01] and he was speechless
[5:03] then said the king to the servants bind
[5:05] him hand and foot and take him away and
[5:08] cast him into outer darkness
[5:10] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[5:12] teeth
[5:13] for many are called but few are chosen
[5:18] then went the pharisees and took counsel
[5:20] how they might entangle him in his talk
[5:23] and they sent out unto him their
[5:24] disciples with the herodians saying
[5:27] master
[5:29] we know that thou art true
[5:31] and teach us the way of god in truth
[5:34] neither carest thou for any man for thou
[5:36] regardless not the person of men
[5:39] tell us therefore what thinketh thou
[5:41] is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar
[5:44] or not
[5:46] but jesus perceived their wickedness and
[5:48] said
[5:49] why tempt ye me ye hypocrites
[5:53] show me the tribute money
[5:55] and they brought unto him a penny and he
[5:56] saith unto them
[5:58] whose is this image and superscription
[6:01] they say unto him
[6:02] caesar's
[6:04] then saith he unto them
[6:05] render therefore unto caesar the things
[6:07] which are caesar's
[6:09] and unto god the things that are gods
[6:12] when they had heard these words they
[6:14] marveled and left him and went their way
[6:18] the same day came to him the sadducees
[6:20] which say that there is no resurrection
[6:22] and asked him saying
[6:24] master
[6:25] moses said
[6:27] if a man die having no children his
[6:29] brother shall marry his wife and raise
[6:31] up seed unto his brother
[6:33] now there were with us seven brethren
[6:36] and the first when he had married a wife
[6:38] deceased and having no issue left his
[6:40] wife unto his brother
[6:42] likewise the second also and the third
[6:45] unto the seventh
[6:46] and last of all the woman died also
[6:50] therefore in the resurrection whose wife
[6:53] shall she be of the seven for they all
[6:56] had her
[6:57] jesus answered and said unto them
[7:00] ye do er
[7:01] not knowing the scriptures nor the power
[7:03] of god
[7:04] for in the resurrection they neither
[7:06] marry nor are given in marriage but are
[7:08] as the angels of god in heaven
[7:11] but as touching the resurrection of the
[7:13] dead have ye not read that which was
[7:15] spoken unto you by god saying i am the
[7:18] god of abraham and the god of isaac and
[7:21] the god of jacob
[7:23] god is not the god of the dead
[7:25] but of the living
[7:28] and when the multitude heard this they
[7:30] were astonished at his doctrine
[7:32] but when the pharisees had heard that he
[7:34] had put the sadducees to silence they
[7:36] were gathered together
[7:37] then one of them which was a lawyer
[7:39] asked him a question tempting him and
[7:41] saying master which is the great
[7:44] commandment in the law
[7:46] jesus said unto him
[7:48] i shall love the lord thy god with all
[7:50] thy heart and with all thy soul and with
[7:52] all thy mind
[7:53] this is the first and great commandment
[7:57] and the second is like unto it
[7:59] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[8:03] on these two commandments hang all the
[8:06] law and the prophets
[8:09] while the pharisees were gathered
[8:10] together jesus asked them saying
[8:12] what think ye of christ whose son is he
[8:15] they say unto him the son of david
[8:18] he saith unto them how then doth david
[8:21] in spirit call him lord saying the lord
[8:24] said unto my lord sit thou on my right
[8:27] hand till i make thine enemies thy
[8:29] footstool
[8:30] if david then called him lord how is he
[8:32] his son
[8:34] and no man was able to answer him a word
[8:37] neither durst any man from that day
[8:39] forth ask him any more questions
[8:43] then spake jesus to the multitude and to
[8:45] his disciples saying
[8:47] the scribes and the pharisees sit in
[8:49] moses seat
[8:51] all therefore whatsoever they bid you
[8:53] observe
[8:55] that observe and do
[8:58] but do not ye after their works for they
[9:01] say and do not
[9:03] for they bind heavy burdens and grievous
[9:05] to be born and lay them on men's
[9:07] shoulders but they themselves will not
[9:09] move them with one of their fingers
[9:12] but all their works they do for to be
[9:14] seen of men
[9:15] they make broad their phylacteries and
[9:17] enlarge the borders of their garments
[9:20] and love the uppermost rooms at feasts
[9:22] and the chief seats in the synagogues
[9:24] and greetings in the markets and to be
[9:26] called of men rabbi rabbi
[9:29] but be not ye called rabbi
[9:32] for one is your master
[9:35] even christ
[9:36] and all ye are brethren
[9:39] and call no man your father upon the
[9:41] earth for one is your father which is in
[9:44] heaven
[9:45] neither be ye called masters for one is
[9:48] your master even christ
[9:51] but he that is greatest among you
[9:53] shall be your servant
[9:55] and whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[9:57] be abased and he that shall humble
[9:59] himself shall be exalted
[10:02] but woe unto you
[10:04] scribes and pharisees hypocrites
[10:08] for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven
[10:10] against men
[10:12] for ye neither go in yourselves neither
[10:14] suffer ye them that are entering to go
[10:16] in woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[10:18] hypocrites for ye devour widow's houses
[10:21] and for a pretense make long prayer
[10:24] therefore you shall receive the greater
[10:26] damnation woe unto you scribes and
[10:28] pharisees hypocrites
[10:30] for ye compass sea and land to make one
[10:33] proselyte and when he is made ye make
[10:35] him twofold more the child of hell than
[10:37] yourselves woe unto you ye blind guides
[10:41] which say whosoever shall swear by the
[10:43] temple it is nothing but whosoever shall
[10:45] swear by the gold of the temple he is a
[10:47] debtor
[10:49] ye fools and blind
[10:52] for whether is greater the gold or the
[10:54] temple that sanctify up the gold
[10:58] and whosoever shall swear by the altar
[11:00] it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by
[11:02] the gift that is upon it he is guilty he
[11:04] fools and blind
[11:06] the weather is greater the gift or the
[11:08] altar that sanctifieth the gift
[11:12] whosoever shall swear by the altar
[11:14] sweareth by it and by all things thereon
[11:16] and whoso shall swear by the temple
[11:18] sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth
[11:21] therein
[11:22] and he that shall swear by heaven
[11:24] sweareth by the throne of god and by him
[11:26] that sitter thereon
[11:29] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[11:31] hypocrites
[11:33] for he pay tithe of mint and anise and
[11:35] come in and have omitted the weightier
[11:37] matters of the law
[11:40] judgment
[11:41] mercy and faith
[11:43] these orgy to have done and not to leave
[11:44] the other undone
[11:46] he blind guides which strain at a gnat
[11:50] and swallow a camel
[11:53] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[11:56] hypocrites
[11:58] for ye make clean the outside of the cup
[12:01] and of the platter
[12:02] but within they are full of extortion
[12:05] and excess
[12:07] thou blind pharisee cleanse first that
[12:09] which is within the cup and platter that
[12:11] the outside of them may be clean also
[12:14] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[12:16] hypocrites for ye are like unto whited
[12:19] sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful
[12:21] outward but are within full of dead
[12:23] men's bones and of all uncleanness
[12:28] even so ye also outwardly appear
[12:30] righteous unto men but within
[12:32] you are full of hypocrisy
[12:34] and iniquity
[12:37] whoa unto you scribes and pharisees
[12:40] hypocrites
[12:42] because he build the tombs of the
[12:44] prophets and garnish the sepulchers of
[12:46] the righteous and say if we had been in
[12:49] the days of our fathers we would not
[12:51] have been partakers with them in the
[12:53] blood of the prophets
[12:56] wherefore ye be witnesses unto
[12:57] yourselves that ye are the children of
[12:59] them which killed the prophets
[13:01] fill ye up then the measure of your
[13:03] fathers
[13:05] ye serpents
[13:07] ye generation of vipers how can ye
[13:09] escape the damnation of hell
[13:12] wherefore behold i send unto you
[13:15] prophets and wise men and scribes and
[13:17] some of them ye shall kill and crucify
[13:20] and some of them shall ye scourge in
[13:21] your synagogues and persecute them from
[13:23] city to city that upon you may come all
[13:26] the righteous blood shed upon the earth
[13:28] from the blood of righteous abel unto
[13:30] the blood of zechariah son of barackias
[13:33] whom ye slew between the temple and the
[13:35] altar
[13:36] verily i say unto you all these things
[13:39] shall come upon this generation
[13:42] o jerusalem
[13:44] jerusalem
[13:46] thou that killest the prophets and
[13:48] stoneest them which are sent unto thee
[13:53] how often would i have gathered thy
[13:54] children together
[13:56] even as a hen gathereth her chickens
[13:58] under her wings
[14:00] and ye
[14:01] would not
[14:03] behold your house is left unto you
[14:06] desolate
[14:08] for i say unto you
[14:10] you shall not see me henceforth
[14:13] till ye shall say
[14:15] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[14:17] the lord
[14:20] and jesus went out and departed from the
[14:22] temple
[14:23] and his disciples came to him for to
[14:24] show him the buildings of the temple
[14:27] and jesus said unto them
[14:28] see ye not all these things
[14:31] verily i say unto you there shall not be
[14:33] left here one stone upon another that
[14:35] shall not be thrown down
[14:37] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[14:39] the disciples came unto him privately
[14:41] saying tell us when shall these things
[14:43] be
[14:44] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[14:46] and of the end of the world
[14:48] and jesus answered and said unto them
[14:50] take heed that no man deceive you for
[14:53] many shall come in my name saying i am
[14:55] christ and shall deceive many
[14:58] and you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[15:00] wars
[15:01] see that ye be not troubled
[15:03] for all these things must come to pass
[15:06] but the end is not yet
[15:08] for nations shall rise against nation
[15:10] and kingdom against kingdom and there
[15:12] shall be famines and pestilences and
[15:14] earthquakes and divers places
[15:17] all these are the beginning of sorrows
[15:21] then shall they deliver you up to be
[15:22] afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[15:25] shall be hated of all nations for my
[15:27] name's sake
[15:28] and then shall many be offended and
[15:30] shall betray one another and shall hate
[15:32] one another
[15:34] and many false prophets shall rise and
[15:36] shall deceive many
[15:37] and because iniquity shall abound the
[15:40] love of many shall wax cold
[15:42] but he that you'll endure unto the end
[15:44] the same shall be saved
[15:47] and this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[15:49] preached in all the world for a witness
[15:51] unto all nations
[15:52] and then shall the end come
[15:55] when ye therefore shall see the
[15:57] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[16:00] daniel the prophet stand in the holy
[16:02] place
[16:03] who so readeth let him understand
[16:06] then let them which be in judea flee
[16:09] into the mountains
[16:10] let him which is on the housetop not
[16:12] come down to take anything out of his
[16:14] house neither let him which is in the
[16:16] field return back to take his clothes
[16:19] and woe unto them that are with child
[16:22] and to them that give suck in those days
[16:25] but pray ye that your flight be not in
[16:27] the winter neither on the sabbath day
[16:31] for there shall be great tribulation
[16:33] such as was not since the beginning of
[16:35] the world to this time no nor ever shall
[16:38] be
[16:39] and except those days should be
[16:41] shortened there should no flesh be saved
[16:44] but for the elect's sake those days
[16:46] shall be shortened
[16:49] then if any man shall say unto you lo
[16:51] here is christ or there
[16:54] believe it not
[16:56] for there shall arise false christs and
[16:58] false prophets and shall show great
[17:00] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[17:03] were possible they shall deceive the
[17:05] very elect
[17:07] behold i have told you before
[17:10] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[17:13] behold he is in the desert
[17:15] go not forth behold he is in the secret
[17:18] chambers believe it not
[17:20] for as the lightning cometh out of the
[17:22] east and shineth even unto the west so
[17:24] shall also the coming of the son of man
[17:26] be
[17:28] for wheresoever the carcasses
[17:30] there will the eagles be gathered
[17:32] together
[17:34] immediately after the tribulation of
[17:36] those days shall the sun be darkened and
[17:38] the moon shall not give her light and
[17:40] the stars shall fall from heaven and the
[17:42] powers of the heavens shall be shaken
[17:45] and then shall appear the sign of the
[17:47] son of man in heaven
[17:48] and then shall all the tribes of the
[17:50] earth mourn and they shall see the son
[17:52] of man coming in the clouds of heaven
[17:55] with power and great glory and he shall
[17:57] send his angels with a great sound of a
[17:59] trumpet and they shall gather together
[18:01] his elect from the four winds from one
[18:03] end of heaven to the other
[18:06] now learn a parable of the fig tree
[18:10] when his branch is yet tender and
[18:11] putteth forth leaves ye know that summer
[18:14] is nigh
[18:16] so likewise ye
[18:18] when you shall see all these things
[18:20] know that it is near
[18:23] even at the doors
[18:25] verily i say unto you this generation
[18:27] shall not pass till all these things be
[18:30] fulfilled
[18:32] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[18:34] words shall not pass away
[18:37] but of that day and hour knoweth no man
[18:40] no not the angels of heaven
[18:43] but my father only
[18:45] but as the days of knowie were so shall
[18:48] also the coming of the son of man be for
[18:50] as in the days that were before the
[18:51] flood they were eating and drinking
[18:53] marrying and giving in marriage until
[18:55] the day that noah entered into the ark
[18:58] and knew not until the flood came and
[19:00] took them all away so shall also the
[19:03] coming of the son of man be
[19:05] then shall two be in the field the one
[19:07] shall be taken and the other left
[19:10] two women shall be grinding at the mill
[19:12] the one shall be taken and the other
[19:14] left
[19:16] watch therefore
[19:18] for ye know not what our your lord hath
[19:21] come
[19:23] but know this that if the goodman of the
[19:26] house had known in what watched the
[19:28] thief would come he would have watched
[19:29] and would not have suffered his house to
[19:31] be broken up
[19:33] therefore be ye also ready
[19:36] for in such an hour as he think not the
[19:38] son of man cometh
[19:41] who then is a faithful and wise servant
[19:44] whom his lord hath made ruler over his
[19:46] household to give them meat and due
[19:48] season
[19:50] blessed is that servant whom his lord
[19:52] when he cometh shall find so doing
[19:55] verily i say unto you that he shall make
[19:57] him ruler over all his goods
[20:00] but and if that evil servant shall say
[20:02] in his heart my lord delayeth his coming
[20:05] and shall begin to smite his fellow
[20:07] servants and to eat and drink with the
[20:09] drunken
[20:10] the lord of that servant shall come in a
[20:12] day when he looketh not for him and in
[20:14] an hour that he is not aware of and
[20:16] shall cut him asunder and appoint him
[20:18] his portion with the hypocrites
[20:20] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[20:22] teeth
[20:25] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[20:27] likened unto ten virgins which took
[20:29] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[20:31] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[20:33] and five were foolish they that were
[20:36] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[20:38] with them but the wise took oil in their
[20:40] vessels with their lamps
[20:42] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[20:44] slumbered and slept
[20:46] and at midnight there was a cry made
[20:48] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[20:51] to meet him
[20:52] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[20:55] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[20:57] the wise give us of your oil for our
[20:59] lamps are gone out but the wise answered
[21:02] saying not so
[21:03] lest there be not enough for us and you
[21:06] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[21:07] buy for yourselves
[21:09] and while they went to buy the
[21:10] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[21:12] went in with him to the marriage and the
[21:14] door was shut afterward came also the
[21:17] other virgin saying lord lord open to us
[21:20] but he answered and said verily i say
[21:22] unto you
[21:23] i know you not
[21:26] watch therefore
[21:28] for ye know neither the day nor the hour
[21:31] wherein the son of man cometh
[21:34] for the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[21:36] traveling into a far country who called
[21:39] his own servants and delivered unto them
[21:40] his goods and unto one he gave five
[21:43] talents to another two and to another
[21:45] one to every man according to his
[21:47] several ability and straightway took his
[21:49] journey
[21:51] then he that had received the five
[21:53] talents went and traded with the same
[21:55] and made them other five talents
[21:57] and likewise he that had received two he
[21:59] also gained other two
[22:01] but he that had received one
[22:04] went and digged in the earth
[22:06] and hid his lord's money
[22:09] after a long time the lord of those
[22:10] servants cometh and reckoneth with them
[22:13] and so he that had received five talents
[22:15] came and brought other five talents
[22:16] saying lord thou delivered stun to me
[22:19] five talents behold i have gained beside
[22:20] them five talents more
[22:23] his lord said unto him well done thou
[22:25] good and faithful servant thou hast been
[22:27] faithful over a few things i will make
[22:29] thee ruler over many things enter thou
[22:31] into the joy of thy lord
[22:34] he also that had received two talents
[22:36] came and said lord thou delivered son to
[22:37] me two talents behold i have gained two
[22:40] other talents beside them his lord said
[22:42] unto him well done good and faithful
[22:44] servant thou hast been faithful over a
[22:45] few things i will make thee ruler over
[22:47] many things and to thou into the joy of
[22:49] thy lord
[22:51] then he which had received the one
[22:53] talent came and said
[22:56] lord
[22:57] i knew thee that thou art and hard man
[23:00] reaping where thou hast not sown and
[23:02] gathering where thou hast not strawed
[23:06] and i was afraid
[23:07] and went and hid thy talent in the earth
[23:10] lo
[23:11] there thou hast that is thine
[23:13] his lord answered and said unto him
[23:16] thou wicked and slothful servant
[23:19] thou knewest that i reap where i sowed
[23:21] not
[23:22] and gather where i have not strawed
[23:25] thou outest therefore to have put my
[23:27] money to the exchanges and then at my
[23:29] coming i should have received my known
[23:31] with usury
[23:33] take therefore the talent from him and
[23:35] give it unto him which hath ten talents
[23:38] for unto everyone that hath shall be
[23:39] given and he shall have abundance but
[23:42] from him that hath not shall be taken
[23:44] away even that which he have
[23:47] and cast ye the unprofitable servant
[23:49] into outer darkness
[23:51] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[23:53] teeth
[23:56] when the son of man shall come in his
[23:58] glory and all the holy angels with him
[24:00] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[24:02] glory
[24:03] and before him shall be gathered all
[24:05] nations
[24:06] and he shall separate them one from
[24:07] another as a shepherd divideth his sheep
[24:10] from the goats
[24:11] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[24:13] hand but the goats on the left
[24:16] then shall the king say unto them on his
[24:17] right hand come ye blessed of my father
[24:20] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[24:22] from the foundation of the world
[24:24] for i wasn't hungry
[24:26] and he gave me meat
[24:27] i was thirsty and he gave me drink
[24:30] i was a stranger and he took me in
[24:34] naked and he clothed me
[24:36] i was sick and he visited me i was in
[24:38] prison
[24:39] and he came unto me
[24:42] then shall the righteous answer him
[24:44] saying lord when saw we thee and
[24:47] hungered and fed thee or thirsty and
[24:49] gave thee drink when saw we thee a
[24:51] stranger and took thee in or naked and
[24:53] clothed thee or when saw we the sick or
[24:56] in prison and came unto thee
[24:59] and the king shall answer and say unto
[25:00] them
[25:01] verily i say unto you in as much as ye
[25:03] have done it unto one of the least of
[25:06] these my brethren
[25:08] ye have done it unto me
[25:11] then shall he say also unto them on the
[25:12] left hand depart from me ye cursed into
[25:16] everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[25:18] and his angels
[25:19] for i wasn't hungry and he gave me no
[25:21] meat i was thirsty and you gave me no
[25:24] drink i was a stranger and he took me
[25:26] not in naked and ye clothed me not sick
[25:29] and in prison and ye visited me not
[25:32] then shall they also answer him saying
[25:33] lord when saw we thee in hungary or a
[25:36] thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or
[25:38] in prison and did not minister unto thee
[25:41] then shall he answer them saying verily
[25:43] i say unto you
[25:45] and as much as ye did it not to one of
[25:47] the least of these he did it not to me
[25:52] and these shall go away into everlasting
[25:55] punishment
[25:56] but the righteous into life eternal
[26:00] [Music]
[26:39] you
