[5:48] long go. He said, "Preacher, do you
[5:51] believe that divine healing is by the
[5:53] atonement?" I said, "Yes, sir."
[5:56] He said, "Well, if I prove to you that's
[5:59] wrong, would you believe what Isaiah
[6:01] said there about?" I said, "Yes, sir."
[6:03] Said, "If I prove to you that's wrong,
[6:04] will you accept it?" I said, "Yes, sir.
[6:07] If you prove it's wrong, God knows I I
[6:09] want to be right with God." I said, "I
[6:12] certainly want to be right with God." So
[6:14] he said, "If I prove to you it's wrong,
[6:16] then you'll accept it." Yes. He said,
[6:18] "Matthew 8 said when they brought Jesus
[6:21] brought all the they brought the sick to
[6:22] him that he heal him that it might be
[6:24] fulfilled which is spoken of by the
[6:25] prophet Isaiah."
[6:27] Why? I said, "Do you mean to apply that
[6:28] to the atonement?" He said, "By his
[6:31] wounded for our transgressions, with his
[6:32] stripes or he bore our infirmities."
[6:34] Said, "Yes." Why? I said, "Then if that
[6:36] be the truth, the atonement had more
[6:37] power before it was made." That's a year
[6:39] and six months before Jesus died. Then
[6:42] the atonement had more power before it
[6:44] was was made than Edith in the force.
[6:48] I said, "Who did Peter heal the man at
[6:50] the gate called beautiful? What kind of
[6:51] a power did he have?" He said, "Only the
[6:54] twel apostles only one had that power."
[6:56] I said, "Shame on you and have a
[6:57] doctor's degree."
[7:01] I said, "I got a boy at home eight years
[7:03] old knows better than that. No better
[7:06] scripture than that." I said, "Do you
[7:08] say the only 12 apostles?" He said,
[7:10] "Yes." I said, "What about Philillip? He
[7:12] wasn't an apostle. He was just a deacon.
[7:15] And he went out there and healed the
[7:16] sick and cast out devils and had a great
[7:18] revival.
[7:20] Many more too." Notice, but he said, he
[7:25] said, "Well, brother Brandon, if there
[7:26] was divine healing was included in the
[7:28] atonement, it would be so killed to
[7:31] there wouldn't even be any pain."
[7:35] I said, "Is there temptation?"
[7:37] He said, "Yes." I said, "Then there's
[7:39] pain,
[7:42] temptation.
[7:44] If the if the atonement kills sin so
[7:46] bad, there's no more temptation then.
[7:48] But it's by faith you overcome your
[7:50] temptation. It's by faith you overcome
[7:52] your pain. It's in the atonement." I
[7:55] said, "We won't argue with that. I'll
[7:57] ask you one thing. Does divine healing
[7:58] in the word?" He said, "Yes." You have
[8:01] to believe that because Jesus said, "The
[8:02] things that I do and whatsoever things
[8:04] you desire, where's divine healing?"
[8:05] What it is when you pray, believe you
[8:07] receive it. said, "It's in the word, but
[8:08] it's not in the atonement." I said,
[8:09] "Then if it's in the word, it's over the
[8:12] atonement." Oh, he said, "Brother
[8:14] Brandon, ridiculous." And a great singer
[8:18] and a great radio minister was standing
[8:20] there too, and this fellow was a quite a
[8:22] character. And he said, "Well, Brother
[8:24] Brandham said, "That's ridiculous. You
[8:26] mean the word is over the atonement?" I
[8:28] said, "Yes, sir.
[8:30] God's got to keep his word." He's got I
[8:33] said, "I'm just believe what God said
[8:35] the truth." He said, "Well, no." I said,
[8:38] "Brother, there was a king one time that
[8:40] had a kingdom and he had the rules and
[8:43] regulations. He made all the everything
[8:45] was to be made in that kingdom and he
[8:47] had a penalty for a certain sin and a
[8:49] slave committed that sin." Let's give
[8:51] him a little parable. Now, I said, "Then
[8:54] he came up and the king said, "Well,
[8:57] there's not one thing if you do the
[8:58] penalty of that sin is to die the
[9:00] death." And the poor fellow was shaking.
[9:02] He said, "Now wait, what can I do for
[9:04] you for take your life?" He said, "Give
[9:05] me a glass of water." He gave him a
[9:07] glass of water. The poor fellow couldn't
[9:08] hold it. He thought his head was going
[9:10] to be cut off. So he his shaking like
[9:12] that. He said, "Now wait a minute." He
[9:14] said, "I'm not going to take your life
[9:16] till you drink that glass of water."
[9:19] The slave poured it on the ground. I
[9:21] said, "Now what's the king going to do?"
[9:23] Oh, he said, "That was a slip up on the
[9:25] king." I said, "It was." Then God
[9:27] saluced. He put it in his word without
[9:28] making an atonement for it. Slip up on
[9:30] God. I know no. I said, "It's in the
[9:34] atonement rather." That's right. When
[9:36] it's in the word, God's got to keep his
[9:38] word. If he's a man of If he's a man of
[9:40] his word, you'll keep his word. And he
[9:42] said, "Whatsoever things you desire when
[9:44] you pray, believe you receive it and you
[9:45] shall have it." That's right. It'll be
[9:47] given to you. All right. Just believe
[9:49] it. All right. Bring the lady. Come
[9:52] ahead, lady. Little cap on. I guess
[9:55] she's Amish. And so then when I've never
[9:58] seen her in my life, she's a total
[10:00] stranger to me. Uh I never knew her. You
[10:03] don't know me, do you, ladies? You don't
[10:06] know me. You before just till now, huh?
[10:09] All right. Now, I want you to come right
[10:11] around here, ladies, so I can get I want
[10:12] to get too far from the microphone. You
[10:14] see, because I my voice sometimes go
[10:16] down. If you notice, see, you're in
[10:19] you're in two dimensions at one time,
[10:22] two phases. You're here and you're
[10:25] looking at something that's happened
[10:26] maybe back when you was a little girl.
[10:29] Something went on in your life somewhere
[10:32] and then and then you're two places at
[10:34] the same time and I'm talking yet I'm
[10:36] somewhere else yet I'm conscious that in
[10:39] body form I'm standing on the platform.
[10:42] That's what makes me so weak and tears
[10:43] me up.
[10:46] You remember the prophet Daniel who had
[10:48] a vision one day and was troubled many
[10:50] days over of his head. Jesus, remember
[10:54] that angel came down on the pool and the
[10:56] first person got a heal while all the
[10:58] virtue went off of the the water and you
[11:01] had to wait for a month or more maybe
[11:03] for it to come back another season,
[11:04] whatever was considered a season. You
[11:07] remember that in the Bible?
[11:11] I'm just talking to you like our Lord
[11:13] talked to the woman at the
[11:16] at the well at Samaria. Now, you you got
[11:20] a human spirit just and I have and
[11:24] there's
[11:26] we're perfect strangers to each other
[11:28] but in way I just look at the people out
[11:31] there several hundreds of people sitting
[11:33] there each one of them is a supernatural
[11:35] being inside and just a full of spirit
[11:40] and then I have to contact your life
[11:43] just as Jesus turned and perceived what
[11:45] the thoughts of the people was and so
[11:47] forth he stood and talked to that woman
[11:49] then he went right straight and told her
[11:50] where her trouble was Is that right?
[11:56] You remember where was that? It's found
[11:58] in St. John the 4th chapter. The woman
[12:00] at the well.
[12:01] You remember reading that?
[12:05] He's wonderful, isn't he? You believe
[12:07] that he rose up from the dead? You did.
[12:10] And that he's living among man tonight,
[12:13] the same Jesus. Then if it's the same
[12:16] Jesus, he'll do just like he did in that
[12:17] day. His spirit among his people. Is
[12:19] that right? It's the same thing. That's
[12:22] good. And um
[12:26] it's so hard preaching and then trying
[12:28] to see if you just just prayed with me
[12:32] the believers. Yes. Here it comes. Now,
[12:36] you just was a little bit afraid, wasn't
[12:38] you?
[12:40] You
[12:41] just a little nervous. That's why don't
[12:43] see you just holding yourself back. But
[12:46] look, you are you have a a condition.
[12:51] Your condition is in inward trouble of
[12:55] the stomach.
[12:56] Isn't that right? That's right. It's a
[12:59] stomach trouble. It's been some time.
[13:02] It's a caused from a nervous condition
[13:05] that makes you have a sour stomach and
[13:07] cramps and so forth and spit up stuff in
[13:09] your mouth which is sour. It's it's an
[13:12] acid. gastric conditions in the stomach.
[13:15] You see, he calls them peptic ulcer that
[13:18] makes your food come up. A little
[13:20] regurgitation comes up like that to it.
[13:22] Pretty close to what he said, wasn't it?
[13:27] How did I know that?
[13:29] If we were just revealed to by God is
[13:32] right. That's right. Now, if we would
[13:36] talk a little longer, maybe he would
[13:38] tell me something else of you. There's
[13:40] lots of people here to be prayed for.
[13:43] But
[13:45] you got had something struck your mind.
[13:47] Then you got a husband that's not well
[13:49] too. Isn't that right? Is that That's
[13:52] right. Raise up your hand.
[13:54] That's He has a bladder trouble, doesn't
[13:57] he? Is that right? Raise up your hand.
[13:59] That's right.
[14:04] You believe that's the spirit of God
[14:06] that you hearing? You believe that God
[14:08] is re it's coming from some supernatural
[14:10] resource, isn't it? sits a little
[14:12] against your teaching that you've been
[14:14] taught that is that's right now you know
[14:16] that's you can't lie now because I you
[14:18] wouldn't do it anyhow because I'm in the
[14:19] presence of you're in the presence of
[14:21] his being here's another thing I see
[14:23] there's an accident just happened in
[14:24] your family some time ago wasn't a boy
[14:27] he got hit with an automobile about two
[14:29] years ago he's got something wrong with
[14:31] his head he calls his memory and things
[14:32] is that right yes it is now do you
[14:34] believe yes I do now come here almighty
[14:37] God author of life give mercy and life
[14:40] unto this poor woman heal her Lord and
[14:43] let her loved ones be made well also
[14:45] Lord. May this be the night of nights
[14:47] for them and may oh God all that back
[14:51] let them walk in the light as the light
[14:52] comes to them Lord and may they be
[14:55] called your children Lord and serve you
[14:57] and love you and be made well in Jesus
[14:59] Christ's name. Amen.
[15:03] I want to ask you mother what you heard
[15:05] talking then it was my voice but it
[15:08] wasn't me using it. what he told you is
[15:11] the truth. And now you go and believe
[15:13] just what has been said and you'll get
[15:15] well. God bless you.
[15:18] Go this way.
[15:20] Are you one of the ushers, sir?
[15:23] Are you believing?
[15:27] Just believe with all your heart.
[15:31] God knows all things. But if you will be
[15:34] real reverent now while it's coming.
[15:39] How do you do sir?
[15:41] I suppose that we are strangers too. Are
[15:43] we Sarah? I never met you in my life.
[15:47] But God has known both of us since we
[15:49] were born.
[15:52] And he's fed you. He's fed me. And here
[15:55] we are this far along in life. And
[15:57] someday we got to stand in his presence
[15:59] to give an account for the deeds that's
[16:01] done in our bodies.
[16:03] And what we should be really reverent
[16:06] people, shouldn't we?
[16:09] Sir, you're here tonight on a mission,
[16:12] not for yourself. You're here for a
[16:14] mission for a loved one. And I believe
[16:15] it's your wife. Is that right? That's
[16:18] right. Your wife has undergone some
[16:21] major operations and she's at the point
[16:23] of death. That's right. Is that the
[16:25] truth?
[16:28] You got a handkip in your pocket? Hand
[16:31] it to me. Just a minute. Almighty God,
[16:35] when Israel was cornered there and the
[16:37] Red Sea before them,
[16:41] the mountains, Pharaoh's army pushing.
[16:45] But you look down through that pillar of
[16:47] fire with angry eyes, said one of the
[16:49] poets. And the Red Sea got scared and
[16:52] moved back because Israel was on the
[16:54] homeward march to the promised land.
[16:58] God, tonight this poor woman laying
[17:00] there very low,
[17:03] near unto death, she's done all that she
[17:07] can do. The doctors, your servants, has
[17:10] done all they can do.
[17:13] Everybody's done all they can do. And
[17:15] now thou Jehovah Gyariah,
[17:19] Lord's provided sacrifice,
[17:22] this crucial moment. I pray Lord as in
[17:25] the Bible we're taught that the taken
[17:28] from the body of Paul handkerchiefs or
[17:30] aprons and unclean spirits went out and
[17:33] people were healed. We know we're not
[17:35] the St. Paul but we know that you're
[17:37] still the same Lord Jesus who honored
[17:39] the faith of the people. Then Lord I
[17:41] send this handkerchief to that dying
[17:43] woman and asked for her life to be
[17:45] spared in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[17:49] Don't doubt. Let no one touch that
[17:51] handkerchief and put it on your wife's
[17:53] underneath garment next to her heart.
[17:56] Get down to the side of her and pray.
[17:57] Confess everything that you know and
[17:59] promise God to live for him. Let us know
[18:01] a few days later what's happened to her.
[18:03] God bless you. God be with you. Now go
[18:05] and don't doubt. Just believe all things
[18:08] and God will certainly perform.
[18:14] You believe this.
[18:18] Have faith.
[18:21] God will certainly grant
[18:24] the things that he has promised for he
[18:26] cannot fail.
[18:29] He's God.
[18:35] Now sister
[18:36] want to speak to you just a moment.
[18:40] And now to this audience here I suppose
[18:44] I I don't know you. Uh, as far as I
[18:48] know, I never seen him alive. But God
[18:51] does know you.
[18:53] But this woman being a stranger to me,
[18:57] the Lord knows that I'm probably
[19:00] stranger to her unless she's been in a
[19:01] meeting somewhere and seen me. We don't
[19:04] know one another at all.
[19:06] Well, if the Holy Spirit will reveal
[19:09] this woman's life
[19:12] and me claiming to you of being his
[19:14] servant, that is the spirit of the Lord
[19:16] Jesus Christ that raised
[19:19] from the dead is here among us tonight.
[19:24] And God will perform just exactly what
[19:26] he said he would do, claiming and
[19:28] proving that Jesus Christ is the same
[19:30] yesterday, today, and forever.
[19:33] I listen to you that would resent it.
[19:36] Maybe your teaching could have been a
[19:37] little bit off. Remember the Pharisees
[19:40] in them days thought they were just
[19:42] exactly right. They were holy, renowned,
[19:45] fundamental, religious man.
[19:48] And they rejected the Jesus. They
[19:51] thought they know just how he must be.
[19:53] But God always confounds the wise and
[19:57] prudent.
[19:59] Now remember, if this would happen to be
[20:02] right and you would be wrong, you'd be
[20:04] blaspheming the Holy Spirit.
[20:07] You'd be doomed forever.
[20:10] Without mercy, this world or the world
[20:13] to come.
[20:18] You have prostate trouble, don't you,
[20:20] sir?
[20:24] Your wife sitting next to you with the
[20:26] rectal trouble, too. Isn't that right?
[20:29] Is that true?
[20:31] You were both healed right then while I
[20:33] was talking.
[20:37] You don't need your prayer. You don't
[20:39] have prayer cards anyhow. You don't need
[20:40] them. The little lady sitting right next
[20:42] to there also
[20:45] she has been sick.
[20:47] [Music]
[20:53] A kidney trouble. But just have faith in
[20:55] God there. God make you well.
[21:03] I be rever
[21:24] you look here at me right at me just a
[21:25] moment. I want to talk to you as your
[21:27] brother.
[21:29] Now, we are perfect and total strangers
[21:32] to each other. And the Lord Jesus,
[21:34] little lady, you had a nerve condition
[21:36] sitting right there with that man,
[21:37] haven't you? You've been real nervous
[21:38] for a long time. Isn't that right? He
[21:40] healed you just then. So, you're you're
[21:43] well now. You can go home and be well.
[21:45] God bless you.
[21:50] Have mercy
[21:52] for you.
[21:55] I be reverent.
[21:58] No, you don't live here. You come a long
[22:01] ways from here.
[22:03] Isn't that right? You come from the
[22:06] state of Illinois. Is that right?
[22:11] About a 200 mile journey you took. Is
[22:14] that right?
[22:17] And you're suffering with something
[22:19] wrong in your lungs, a lung condition.
[22:21] and say, "I see you trying to get out of
[22:23] a bed of a morning. You have an
[22:24] arthritis condition, too. It makes you
[22:26] stiff." That's true.
[22:33] Do you believe Christ will make you
[22:35] well?
[22:38] Look to me. I don't You know what I
[22:40] mean? Like Peter and John said, "Look on
[22:42] us." Elijah the prophet said, "If it
[22:44] wasn't our respected presence of
[22:46] Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look to
[22:47] you."
[22:50] Now believe
[22:54] you've been you've been in a prayer
[22:56] meeting before.
[22:58] It wasn't mine. It was a man kind of
[23:00] heavy set chunky built with a kind of a
[23:04] brown hair and he kind of has a frown on
[23:07] his face like very sharp speaking man at
[23:10] the meeting. Is that right? If that's
[23:12] right, raise your hand. I've seen it
[23:14] come before me. It can't be nothing
[23:16] else. God can't lie.
[23:24] The doctor told you to go home. I see
[23:25] him telling you said you only thing for
[23:27] you do is take a a long rest in the
[23:29] hospital or wait I see a prairie. He
[23:32] said you could go west if you wanted to.
[23:34] Is that right? Is that what he told you?
[23:37] That's right.
[23:39] That's exactly right.
[23:44] You have a little son at home, don't
[23:45] you? And he has a lung trouble too,
[23:47] doesn't he? If that's right, raise up
[23:48] your hand. That's right. Come here just
[23:51] a moment, please. Almighty God, author
[23:55] of life, giver of every good gift, send
[23:59] thy blessings upon this woman, upon her
[24:02] household while she's standing here in
[24:04] the Holy Spirit moving through her now.
[24:08] May she go home and get well. Father, as
[24:11] your servant, I bless her with my hands
[24:14] laying upon her in the name of Jesus
[24:16] Christ. and Satan,
[24:20] you who bound her,
[24:22] done all this evil, we come tonight as
[24:26] the Christian people in the
[24:28] representative name of Jesus Christ. And
[24:31] we adjure thee by him that you leave the
[24:34] woman and bother her no more. Come out
[24:37] of her through Jesus Christ's name.
[24:43] Now return, don't doubt nothing. You get
[24:47] well. God bless you.
[24:52] All right.
[24:56] Do you believe?
[25:02] If the Holy Spirit will just tell you
[25:04] what's wrong, you're conscious that
[25:06] something's going on. That's the angel
[25:09] of the Lord. You see his picture? That's
[25:12] just what's waving over you now. your
[25:15] troubles in your back. Is that right?
[25:18] Now go ahead. You're going to get well.
[25:20] He's blessed you. God be with you and
[25:22] bless you. Let's say thanks be to God.
[25:30] Do you believe
[25:32] with all your heart?
[25:39] Just a moment.
[25:51] Somebody sitting right there sir got a
[25:54] back trouble too. Was that right sir? He
[25:56] was healed just now then. When that man
[25:57] was healed that spirit called out for
[25:59] help. God bless you.
[26:05] You were praying, wasn't you, sir? I
[26:08] thought you were. I've seen someone
[26:10] praying with a back like that and I
[26:11] heard that scream come out. I looked
[26:13] back and I seen this man. Then I heard
[26:15] it call and I seen a light hang over
[26:16] you. So it must be that it was you.
[26:22] That lady sitting right down there at
[26:23] the other side there has a nervous
[26:25] trouble been bothering her right down
[26:27] there in that light head. Ain't that
[26:29] right, sister? Yes, sir. You've had
[26:31] nervous trouble. Isn't that right? You
[26:33] just got healed just then. God made you
[26:35] well. That little lady sitting right
[26:38] behind her, that female trouble sitting
[26:39] right back there behind her, too. You
[26:41] just healed the same time. Sister, you
[26:42] can stand up also. Raise up your hand.
[26:44] You had a female trouble. It's been on
[26:46] the ovary. So, was abscess. It's gone
[26:49] from you. Now, you can be healed. Go
[26:51] home.
[26:53] Amen.
[26:54] [Applause]
[26:55] Why do you doubt God?
[27:01] Sir, would you like to go eat your
[27:02] supper?
[27:04] Enjoy it again? You believe me to be his
[27:06] prophet? Well then in the name of Jesus
[27:09] Christ, go and eat your supper, eat your
[27:12] breakfast, testify of your healing, the
[27:15] ulcer is gone from your stomach. God
[27:18] bless you. You believe that? You don't
[27:21] doubt. Come lady,
[27:24] do you believe
[27:26] you believe me to be his servant?
[27:30] If God would tell me what was wrong with
[27:32] you quickly without saying anything
[27:34] farther. So much of that gets me so weak
[27:36] it'll get swimming.
[27:39] You believe that does that? Our Lord
[27:42] said virtue has gone out from me. What
[27:46] is virtue strength? When the woman
[27:48] touched his garment it's pulling from
[27:50] all over this audience
[27:52] and you got heart trouble.
[27:55] Is that right? How you believe you're
[27:57] healed? Then go and testify of it. God
[28:00] will be with you. You had the same
[28:02] thing, sir. So you can just keep
[28:03] walking. God did the same thing.
[28:08] Female trouble. Just keep going. Be made
[28:10] well in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[28:14] You believe out there with all your
[28:15] heart,
[28:17] don't doubt. Have faith now. God will
[28:20] bring it to pass. If you absolutely
[28:22] believe it and don't doubt at all, God
[28:24] will bring it to pass.
[28:31] Be reverent.
[28:33] Have faith in God.
[28:42] What about way up in the corner there?
[28:43] Are you believing?
[28:46] Raise up your hand.
[28:49] Stay right with it.
[28:53] Just went to the corner twice.
[28:56] Hallelujah. Now come here lady. You
[28:58] don't get over that cancer.
[29:01] You would you accept Jesus as your
[29:03] healer now?
[29:07] Now hope to won't do it. Sister
[29:12] you either look or die. You look, you
[29:14] live.
[29:16] It's up to you. Father, I pray for faith
[29:19] for the woman. May she live in Jesus
[29:23] Christ's name. I ask it. Amen. God be
[29:27] with you.
[29:29] How do you do, lady? You believe me to
[29:32] be his servant? You believe that he's
[29:34] here now? You believe his spirit's here
[29:36] to make you well?
[29:41] You're a stranger here in this city,
[29:43] too. You're from Toleda. Is that right?
[29:48] Aren't you a minister? Your husband's a
[29:50] minister, too. That's right. Sitting
[29:52] right there. Never seen him alive.
[29:55] But you got heart trouble, haven't you?
[29:57] You're healed. God bless you. Go on.
[29:59] See, your mental attitude is quite a
[30:01] difference between you and the lady just
[30:02] passed here. Go go have faith. All
[30:06] right. Come, sir.
[30:09] Believing.
[30:11] Almighty God, I ask you to heal the man,
[30:13] deliver him in the name of the Lord
[30:15] Jesus Christ. May it be so. Amen. That's
[30:18] the way you heal while you're sitting
[30:20] right there in God bless you.
[30:22] All right.
[30:24] You know, if you ever had heart trouble
[30:25] and be made well, if you want to accept
[30:27] it right now and believe that God's
[30:28] going to make you well,
[30:32] Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll heal the
[30:34] woman and may she go home tonight and
[30:37] get completely well through Jesus
[30:38] Christ's name. Amen. Now, go look, look,
[30:42] live, see, believe him with all your
[30:44] heart. God will bring it to pass. Let's
[30:47] say thanks be to God.
