[Applause] [Music] amen that's our way of saying Happy Mother's Day amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you you can have your seat amen amen amen praise the lord we have a uh what if I will visit us in our gates there's uh [Music] a big group of visitors that came from Georgia and from around the world let me call it around the word amen praise the Lord so I won't leave anybody out they are from around the world and they flew in on the weekend to to support sister promise in her graduation congratulations again sister promise praise the Lord [Applause] I remember a couple of years back I think I can remember the year but uh Danny from Iowa I think Eda was there preaching or something like that he told me about promise being around we didn't make much contact with her until brother hero came around and uh and then we we had her year with us for some time and we just appreciate you know it's uh I've been I've been I've been so blessed to have all of these different ones uh being able to school yet and and come through this place for church we we have been so blessed to have them praise the Lord you know wow for me now what I think and believe is the other their parents make the greatest sacrifice to be able to send them over the sea amen it is it is almost like Jacob taking her beloved baby and and putting him on the night River the river full of alligators praise the Lord because she believed that that child was a promised child amen and that's how I feel in my heart so I I think that that is the least I can do just to be able to support the cause of your parents if I can be there to encourage you I don't want to make a church member out of you I don't expect any one of you that come from overseas to come to school in Minneapolis to stay I mean you came to be able to find the path of your life so you have the choice to move anywhere but the least that we can do to support you and encourage you that's what we try to do praise the Lord we have had many that have come true and we have been so blessed Supreme and privileged to work with them so uh all of our visitors from around the world that came for the graduation only the graduation can you please stand and let us welcome you appropriately praise the Lord [Music] praise the Lord praise the Lord God bless you and you are most welcome praise the Lord and amen go to see Joe amen very much is not a

can be able to Fellowship around the world praise the Lord I promised God that today I was standing and just testify a little bit of how God has been merciful to us and me and my family after awaiting

think it was a Thursday we always have prayer you know the prayer I mean you want to listen to a tape on the Wednesday on a Thursday then this sermon came into my heart to listen to is he any too is it anything too hard for the Lord to do so and as we were listening to the service the prophet was just talking about the very same situation we're dealing with he was talking about Abraham and all of it as they were expecting a baby you know different things was just happening wrong and that's when God visited them you know and I was uh we just listened to the tip at the end we pray together and we decided to keep it and we were preparing for a miracle and I covered the one and said brother one you know we want to meet you and on a Wednesday we went in the office you know brother one just went Isaiah mistaken and I told Brother one I said brother one we're going for a long ride but we're believing that God we believe in God for a miracle and that was in November and we continue and we continue to pray we pray together with my wife you know every day every night we just together praying and then the next checkup the next ultrasound and that bright spot was still there you know we did not give up we continue to pray and we pray we pray and the following are to sound and just before we leave the house my wife looks at me and say Ariel I feel like today is going to be the last day we actually show up to this hospital I look at her I just knew it will happen so we came to the ultrasound and we were just there and the doctor check everything and checking they were checking

the Lord Proverbs chapter 31 glory be to God amen amen Proverbs chapter 31 . okay now I have to figure out this thing again good they give me this fancy thing Proverbs chapter 31 I want I want to speak on them on the on the message this morning I actually was going to preacher actually change my my title few minutes before I came up I was going to speak on uh in this Prophet one is where uh Solomon said who can find the virtuous woman so I was going to speak on a veterans woman whose work praise her in the gates so I will be going into that direction but I changed my my subject this morning and I entitled to what you see up there the king mother prophecy so we will read that part of uh proverb proverb 101 we would read the first few nine verses there and we will we will give that again as our mother day uh taught here and then we will go into our message I know some of our visitors have to fly out some right after the service some this evening so we will do our best not to keep you long but then I also hope that you ate before you came because with me you can never tell praise the Lord Proverbs chapter 1. no Teddy one I said Proverbs chapter 31. I mean proverb 1 31 reading from verse 1. Proverbs chapter 31 the reading from verse 1. praise the Lord and you love the Lord amen can we say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus the words of King limero the prophecy that his mother taught him the prophecy that his mother taught him praise the Lord what my son what the son of my womb and what the son of Mount vowel I won't go ahead of myself let me just read it you can have this then you have your seat give net that strength unto women know the ways of not that way so that which destroyth king it is now for king or email that it is now for King to drink wine known for princess strong drink leaves they drink and forget the Lord and prefer Judgment of inning of The Afflicted give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and whine unto those that be of heavy heart let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more open the mouth for uh for the dome in in the course of all such as are appointed to destruction open the mouth Josh righteously and plead the cause of the poor and needed the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord before we go into our message this morning we we want to find out who is this King who is his King now the scripture says here the words of the king if you check in in history in Biblical history there is no King that is actually called by thy name and the reason why is there the this was a special name you know this was a special name and and this was a name that uh Solomon mother gave him it was a pet name like every mother have a pet name for their child it was a special name it was a bounding name a name that beshiba used to bound with Solomon praise the Lord are we together now so uh uh I got a little bit distracted here because uh you know I put I put all of these cheers here last last night or this morning about Jordan myself were doing some work and that police chase here for my special friends and uh and I've I wanted all of those kids that can be away from their parents to be able to sit here and we will have those seats reserved for them the boys who beat in the front and the girls will be in the back you know while we have brother kennecaps here preaching for us one time ago and uh there's a story that you always tell he says when the Tabernacle was fell he grew up in Branham Tabernacle he said brother Branham will call all the kids to come and sit before the pulpit for them to give the seats to the visitors so the kids will come and sit before the pulpit and they will not be looking at brother Branham they will be looking at their parents so a parent will have the opportunity to be sitting there and seeing their child biting their finger or maybe sleeping while they sit on in the puppet front and brother Branham is preaching but then he said brother Brandon will always say he will say bless you little ones for giving your seat to the visitors you have done something for the Lord praise the Lord and uh uh my first year I mean that was back 2004 or so I was back there in South Africa preaching I met at all uh a gentlemen no sending me from here sending me from here like he gave his dad his seat he'd have a seat in front of you I'm just talking about them so she said they are my friends I will work with them praise the Lord I met an old old gentleman he was one of this way okay oh Johnny he was one of the one of the the oldest preacher there in uh in in South Africa the uncle to Jordan is a friend of mine and then uh [Music] you know after we we Minister for them he was telling me you know uh last story he said so he told me and he said because he was sitting in the front he was sitting right in the front staring in my face I mean this man was preaching before I was even born and then he told me and after the chef he said you know I've always loved to sit in the front just from a little boy always loved because I believe that the word meets you first before it gets to the people back then praise the Lord amen so yeah we will try and work with our little one say man we want to we want to work on the attention span and uh you know uh teach them to take notes and now to be biting their finger and playing on their phone in order so so let's get right into what we want to talk about here so uh this name uh if you if you watch that name carefully you will realize that the name sounds similar as Emmanuel okay it sounds similar as a matter it does not means there though uh but you will realize that it was it was uh Solomon what Solomon is doing here and what I want to do this morning as we talk on Mother's Day Solomon is taking his mother Council as a prophecy what his mother advised him as a Young Man he's taken there he has grown up he has gone into the eras of of his thousand adulterous women he's now remembering that's a little boy his mother advised him and say my baby don't give yourself to drink don't give yourself to strange woman so Solomon is going to take his mother counsel and then he's going to compare it to who can find a virtuous woman praise the Lord Solomon is going to tell you that you will never be a successful husband if you despise your mother counsel VES because your first girlfriend supposed to be your mama yeah just like a boy a girl first boyfriend supposed to be her daddy we pray that the Lord will help us here amen don't worry we'll keep telling you happy Mother's Day praise the Lord okay I have in uh okay kind of work on these things a little bit late so so uh if you if you look here in the Prof in in verse 2 Solomon says his his mama said oh what my son what the son of my womb the son of My Vow that's that that's where the name comes from the Son Of My Vow and the last economy means belong to God that's what the names means belongs to God it was a symbolic name for Solomon so Solomon is taking his mother counsel as a prophecy praise the Lord that's why you don't play with your mama worse your mother might never go to church she might never believe in the Lord Jesus but she prayed she prayed because bunch of all religious people we only think that you pray when you get on your knees and live for your hands but any hot cry to God it's a prayer the Bible said why he got laid down there she wept and God here from heaven Hallelujah praise the Lord now you will realize that when Solomon was born the Bible says a second Samuel there uh okay and David comfortable Sheba his wife after the first child died and waiting on to hurt and lay with herd and she beared a son and he called his name Solomon now David was the one that gave him that name Solomon which means peace David is saying God has comforted me praise the Lord amen but watch the scripture here the Bible says he called his name Solomon and the Lord loveth the child and he sent God loved the child so much that he said by the hand of net on the prophet and he called his name Jedediah because of the Lord which means beloved of the Lord amen so God called him you are my beloved Solomon said you bring comfort and peace to me Beersheba said you are the child of my vowed I give you to God praise the Lord you know you always gets silent on The Dean on table when the food is sweet so your silence don't trouble me [Music] praise the Lord I know that you are you are swallowing something down are we together praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so Solomon year is bringing to us a real time mother the message praise the Lord amen you have to realize that Solomon wrote the book of proverb after he Hasa reconciled with the Lord Pro uh ecclesiastic show the the fully of Solomon and uh uh uh Proverbs show the wisdom of Solomon amen now so this is what we want to look at here he's he's trying to make us to see his mother counsel that I said young man her mother would call to him limel you know it is it is now for King to drink wine give now that strength unto women praise the Lord are we together now because you what what you have to realize here in structural context is that because of the the way Solomon was born the way belsheba came into the kingdom the way she became a wife unto David she was not the favorite neither was her children the favorite praise the Lord if you actually look at the Psalms of David Absalom was the favorite David loved Absalom and even the people love Absalom but it was God by the prophet Nathan that took David it will be none of your sons but this child that was born out of their Sheba praise the Lord it was God's choice are we together it's amazing it's a story of Grace and Redemption amen it's a story of Grace and Redemption and let me see if we can uh we can I can I can show you there uh I'm I'm a little bit ahead of myself here praise the Lord I'm a little bit ahead of myself but it's it's okay we'll be fine now brother Branham said this I wanted to read this before I get into my all of my alone talking this morning yeah the other day that I was talking to a mother on the telephone and the mother said oh brother Brandon Oh Billy she said my poor boy poor boy is in trouble saying oh what a trouble he's in I said yes but Brown knew what was happening I know about it dear sister and she said he may be wrong I don't know say one said this the other said that I don't know but said no matter whether he's wrong or right I love him that's a mother's heart because there is no babush for a child there you are I love him he's here to his mother said I have been so deceived by this and that said mother I believe you are about the only sweet heart I really have a woman there's truth to mean and stick with me that's mother's love there's a real mother thou will put her arm around her baby regardless whether he or she is wrong or right praise the Lord she goes right on to him and if a mother can think about her baby how much more will God think about his praise the Lord because the virtue of motherhood comes from God chavel he is the breasted one are we together that special bounding of a mother and a child the prophet of God explain it to us he said because the the womb is right under the heart so they'll create the connection that a mother has with her baby are we together and he also said this teaching on Moses he said in God how we thank thee this time be for motherhood a real mother in the midst of all the darkness and adultery and felt in Corruption of the word yet we got real genuine mothers praise the Lord how we thank thee for them young and all both alike we thank thee father for real motherhood and we pray God that you will bless them is that your prayer let's give the Lord a hand of praise [Applause] thank you Lord amen amen amen Hallelujah so we see here we want to look into this thing here uh Solomon is now going to take this prophecy which of course like I said is actually his mama Council he's going to take his mother Council and because everything that her mother advised him he saw it coming to pass in his life he took it as a prophecy and he wrote it among his proverbs praise the Lord now just like I said like I said we see grace here you go to Matthew chapter one let's read verse one the bulk of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham Abraham beget Isaac Isaac beget Jacob Jacob beget Judah in his brethroughs and Judah began pharaohs and Zara of tema praise the Lord verse 5 and Simon bequette begin Boaz of Rahab so Boaz the Maori Ruth his mother was Rahab from Jericho are we together now this is the generation of Jesus Christ and as you continue to read Boaz beget or belt of Ruth amen and Jesse verse 6 beget David the king and there they began Solomon of her there's been the wife of Urias now so in this generation of Jesus Christ there are five women that are listed five women that are listed in the generation of Jesus Christ which of course is is not normal in biblical party whenever they get to genology women are never placed in genology but when it comes to the genology of Jesus Christ five women are listed four of them are Gentile women and four of them did not have good testimony time she had to disguise herself I said how to get a c from Judah we know about rehab she was a street prostitute amen we know it about Ruth she came from an insect's background lot's own daughter sleeping with him to have the moabites praise the Lord and here is Beersheba here also the woman that David committed adultery right around me in the message Grace he says it is it is now only David that is our fault he said Beersheba was negligent praise the Lord so we'll see here that we have four women four women that were tied four generation before a Warman that is a virgin will come on the scene so this is a story of Grace five is the number of Grace and the story of Grace is that God is bringing you from an abominable past to become a virgin bride you've been a virgin bride of Jesus Christ your flesh [Applause] praise the Lord that's the reason why we must appreciate the grace of God we must appreciate the grace of God and let me tell you one thing about appreciation it is not you that give it that feel like you are appreciating nor is he that received praise the Lord so if a person tell you that and then not feel appreciated don't say but I appreciated you it is not you that give that determine appreciation is the one that receives [Music] so it is not are you in a message Church well you you I mean you're living your best religious life I said God I appreciate your grace no it is he that determines this is your life story right here and right here is the grace of God [Music] praise the Lord I have always bought for me thy God never cease to address this that even in the genology of Jesus Christ God will mention the one who was the wife in the genology of Jesus Christ God who acknowledge a one that will be a type of Jesus Christ for the millennium the son of David the promised Kingdom but yet God wife of your eyes praise the Lord amen do something and let the pastor mention it or let your parents mention it you get crazy about it you pick your flesh hundreds of years God praise the Lord all of this women you think about it all of these women do you know what it is with tema going around the city and everybody is saying you see that girl she disguise herself like a prostitute slept with her father-in-law but when it came to Judah he said she's more righteous than ah praise the Lord rehab praise the Lord rehab like a preacher said he says at the wedding of Rahab Joshua stood there and said is there one year that have a reason why this woman must not marry this man praise the Lord if you dare live for your hand you will be killed because all the accusations supposed to stay in Jericho [Music] praise the Lord rope the first Kingsman one boy said you were redeem everything of Naomi he says I will redeem it says but you have to redeem Ruth he said no no she's more about it no he fulfilled his right because of Ruth what's your life story what's your life story are we together happy Mother's Day amen happy Mother's Day can we give a hand of praise to the Lord praise the Lord so we see Solomon here ASA is taking the the story that his mother told him and he's he's using that now for for uh a prophecy the words of the king the prophet said that his mother taught him the prophecy that his mother taught him that's Proverbs 1 verse 1. now so Solomon from verse 1 12 verse 9 he repeated the words of his mother and then in verse 10 he counts us with the statement and he said who can find a veterans woman he never said who can find a virtuous women a virtuous woman praise the Lord amen he is dealing with a con the contracts of his mother praise the Lord and the contracts of all the women he have had in his life who can find a veterans woman now brother Branham will let us to know about that actually was a prophecy it was not about any certain woman right because Solomon have heart housing amen [Music] so that was actually a prophecy and we can we can believe that it was a prophecy because we can see it right here someone is thinking the counsel of his mother as a prophesied and then he's comparing it to the many women he has had in his life and brother bear says the purpose of the many women was because of this marriage and divorce he says now look in the final analysis Lord there is one Jesus Christ is that right one man God Emmanuel do you believe that but but the members of his wives are many see thousand times thousands of thousands is that right his wife one wife bride the church you understand them but to get this marriage and therefore straighten out so that you who know which is right and which is wrong now he plainly shows here in tight [Music] there is one Christ and many members of that wife one wife so Solomon many wives that he had was a type of the Bride coming from all around the world but she will be one bride amen there is no room for polygamy in this there is no teaching a polygali in this are we together it was a type it was a prophecy are we together [Music] there is one Christ and many member of that wife noticed he can put us away for Spiritual fornication and false Doctrine at any time he want to anytime now let me tell you something if God wants to punch you away you don't have to kick you out of the church he can put you away by stop dealing with your heart [Music] you can just become former in the church and all you have to do is complain nothing is working yeah yeah God don't have to kick you away from the church amen he can put us away for Spiritual fornication and false Doctrine false concept false teachings in a time he won't talk but how dare you how dare you try to put him away how dare you you will be digging your own grave with your teeth amen are we together so you see the contracts here he's taking his mother prophecy and he's comparing it with the many women who can find a veterans woman if you actually read that you go through that you will realize there is no one woman on Earth that holds all of these qualities no why because it's a many member deposit God deposited around the world because it was a prophecy now for the physical woman or a spiritual woman [Music] the Bride of Jesus Christ who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies are we together you can go home later on your bed and read the rest praise the Lord you can either think about your life or think about the one you want to get married to but let's drop down yeah a little bit amen Hallelujah are we together see what he says here verse 29 he says many daughters have done virtuously many daughters have done virtuously but thou exceedeth them all praise the Lord when Luther came the hair told the the the the the the virtue of the word every Revival that came praise the Lord head toe the pureness of their word until the denominator so many daughters have done virtuously but thou has seated them all why because you heard to the opening of the seals [Music] The Mystery of the hour this is the prophecy it's not about a physical woman reach favor is deceived deceitful and beauty is vain go in marriage and divorce you see brother I'm talking all of this he said Beauty you hardly like flowers in the church they like beautiful church and all of that you know so he he keeps comparing this in a spiritual form but a woman that fear of the Lord shall be praised give her of the fruit of her hand and let her own works praise her in the gate praise the Lord amen let The Works of her hands or her own hands let her praise her in the kids are we together praise the Lord now so we want to travel yet a little bit and see uh uh uh come to Dad brother Branham who says here we we have heard that over and over here he says after all the backbone of every nation is its Morris the backbone of every nation is the Morris the beauty of the church is the character of the people it is State the morals of the church amen Hallelujah the backbone of the home is not our bank account no the backbone of the home is the moral the standard the principle that's why I keep at home that's why I keep your family it's not our job titles it's not our bank account when the moral drops in a nation then the nation is gone mother holds broken you just might as well fought up praise the Lord that's the reason why this this uh the word can no longer hold why because the morals of the nation the Morris of the word is gone why because motherhood is broken are we together all other nations have done it and ours is no exception are we together the reason why is that Birdman in the message are invisible Union said God a woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not Define she is entrusted to that there is no creature on earth like a woman not even a man brother Brown said no creature he never said no animal like the woman he said no creature nothing that is Created from God why because he said but because she was cast over on their side she has also been given a sacred charge from God for let's say together four four Redemption so the prophet of God yet is going to teach us that the three sacred virtue that is given to the woman it was now only because of marriage it was because of redemption that's the reason why the promise of redemption was given to the woman in in Genesis Chapter 3 The Seed of the woman the promise was not given to the man it was not a seed of a man it was the seed of a woman a woman having a seed with no man influence now so he's making us to realize that God gave a woman these three sacraments you just like he gave to the church so he says that he was given to her because of redemption God's greater plane in his mind the plane of redemption he hear the secret of redemption in the woman that's the reason why he shot the Earth it was dark the man was asleep and he took the woman into a separate place and give her this vacuum praise the Lord amen like we have said and taught many times a woman power is not in competing with man a woman could be more smarter than a man but yet her power is not in her knowledge her power is in her virtue praise the Lord it's in her virtue is something that God gave her and it's a sacred charge that God gave to her for one purpose one purpose for what for what praise the Lord for Redemption that's what he was given to her are we together amen now so we see it here these three sacred trusts is a virgin saying a Womanhood in her motherhood praise the Lord so God gave her this this sacred Trust he designed her that way amen a man can go and take uh female hormones whatever to change his body and all of that God did not give him that virtue praise the Lord amen amen he can try and pretend and talk like a woman and swing your hand like this and all of that just step on his toe he will do his muscle like yeah yeah yeah just confront him a little bit you'll soon see the man stop coming out because you was not given to him like I said by Nature think about it by Nature Nature design it nobody make it a recommendation it's nature that design it that kindergarten are always taught by women go to Alice cool around the world you will never find a man teaching kindergarten who bear with those little children it's a good Guinea they don't even know about it in the Bible they're never ready in the message but yet nature tells them that a man have a short spin to spend with little kids praise the Lord I'm tired I'm tired it's not designed that way glory be to God Hallelujah Hallelujah amen are we together [Music] she's she's designed that way that's the reason why we must be proud young women we must be proud because that's your strength that's your strength that's where your power and your Authority is over it's not it's not it's not in it's not in competition it's not in competition I mean you might you might get angry and just talk talk talk talk talk maybe the man get tired he came quiet and you think you have won because yeah but that's not where your strength is your strength is hidden and by Nature everything of Great Value God hate it the diamonds I had in the Earth the gold I hid in the Earth the minerals of the word I hid in the Earth the virtue of life life hate in a woman she was called the mother of all living are we together so we are looking at this prophecy Solomon remembering his mother counsel you are the son of My Vow can't don't give themselves to wine you would get drunk and you will abuse your power praise the Lord some don't give yourself to strange women Solomon is remembering counsel his mother gave him see God designed it that way people he designed it that way when the Bible says in the image of God he made man male and female that's the perfect representation of God the male and female representation that's the perfect representation of God it types the word and the spirit God will always keep there because that's what brings balance to life praise the Lord amen he designed it that way that there is there there have to be a father and a mother that's the reason why this word in this craziness is not going to work it is not going to work God did not design two men to raise a child he did not design two women no matter how how your pink Y how they distract God they're not design it that way because it is not just dwelling together it is what the tenderness of a child withdraw from each of the parents it's not the toys you give them or the money is the thing that their innocent soul pulls from you praise the Lord amen they pulls from you that's why the prophet of God says the children of God I mean the little children they have the the uh the greatest ability to forgive you whip them you punish them after a while they run right back into your arms why they do that because there is something there's a connection that they pulls from you and the way almighty God designed it is that with with with the photo with uh uh uh parenting God designed it in a way that that the the the the the the position of the male will will begin to fill that emotional path in the young woman praise the Lord amen if God can help us to be Godly fathers and the right kind of for men in our home and we fill that place where it is not just a a setting our our own personal standards but what it's going to do is that it's going to bring their young woman to the place where I I mean she sees setting quality in her father amen that as she love her father she will want to find a man that she can find to see me and the same thing with the mother God designing their way praise the Lord people say why are you just like that boys love their mother no that's the way God designed it he designed it that way because it's right in US amen a young boy get at a certain place as soon as he started getting around 18 20 for some reason he turned to like the Friendship of girls it's not because he's womanizing it is that thing in him because that's the full image it has to be a male and female so he needs the guidance he needs the instruction praise the Lord he needs to have a Godly mother where he can trust and start to tell his feelings stop the same thing with a young woman she gets around that edge she has a bunch the whole house is filled with sisters but yes she likes to talk to boys it's a design that's the way God because that's the image male and female it has to be there praise the Lord so Solomon here dealing with this prophecy he's bringing us to the place to realize that in one sense he's appreciating his mother but yet in another sense he's saying failure to listen to my mother's counsel I left me in the hands of adulterous women praise the Lord whether you like it or not you can learn all you want to learn from Google what we are talking about is God's Lord [Music] it's a law of God praise the Lord amen that's why Paul who says it's a commandment that comes with a promise pair of children obeying your parents glory be to God Amen now to be too personal yeah but there was one time uh because of the situation back home 90 1993 that left my Paris I moved to another region because the place was getting biting you know and all the child soldiers and all of that I moved to another region and that was that was uh the end of uh towards the end of 93-94 and God bless us there uh we started a little group a little church there and all of that and then from there we moved over to the Articles because of trouble and all of that but it was it was about five seven years I've gone without my parents just a young man and uh uh you know doing the best that we knew how to do for the Lord at the time they came a certain time in my life I felt like I needed to go back home I just had that that pulled on me and I will tell you that choice changed my life I felt I needed to go back home I felt that I I I I I uh all my parents some explanation [Music] maybe my father was I mean he was not a message believer need of my mother my stepmother was not a message believer so where we were as a young believer with everything that was happening I was trying to you know serve the Lord in the best that I knew but there were many things I was doing wrong when you get over zealous and I use you stopped you think now you know truth you can talk to your parents anyhow the Bible say the scripture says I feel like I needed to go back home so I went home and they were all happy to see me especially my my mother my stepmother blessed memory you know uh I remember her weeping and you know she called All My Sisters and you know and and told them to Prevail or mean to stay but I really never came to say so after spending some time with them I told him I want to talk to them when they were in my dad's room I mean I I will now say is that I calculated this in my mind I would just say that it was the grace of God it was after that I knew what a blessing it was sat with my parents and how to apologize to them for everything that I did and I was I was I was pastoring at the time as a young man I would not even married yet and then I shop with them and I talked to them and all of that my my mother she just had one thing in her mind tell me that you are here to stay all she had you know you know she was glad to see me and she said no you have to stay I said no mama I have to go back you know I couldn't tell her you know I'm a pastor of a church and that was that that was not the purpose the purpose was just to be able to reconcile with my parents because they never wanted me to leave at the time but I felt like my life was so much in a danger because there are things by the grace of God I I just couldn't do you know so I sat them down I told them I was living I'm going to be okay and so because I felt like they you know they were not too happy for me to leave so I need to go back home and they were just different things that I apologize because I knew as a young believer you know I'll take care of my my parents clothes and my mom she would bring her trousers I tell her mama we might not supposed to wear trouser I'm not washing it that's not the scripture young people that's not the scripture it's just a foolish zeal and praise the Lord you are supposed to live the word live a life where your parents will be convinced not criticize them not condemn them but live a life get salty where your parents will become testy so you know we sat down and I I sell all of that and laughing you know and but uh daddy told me he said Son say I'm proud of you is it because you know I led one of his friends to the Lord and when the man went back home you know he told my father you know so he he asked me he says you know Samuel I said yeah he says you know he came home he told me the good thing about you proud of you and I spent a couple of weeks there I had to go back and I went back but I will tell you that affected me it did not made me reach but it affected me in such a powerful way in such a powerful praise the Lord so Solomon is dealing with the same year he's dealing with the same he's looking back into his life to remember him the childhood counsel of his mother praise the Lord and I will leave you here in few minutes I see remember these things he goes back to uh different thoughts Hallelujah you love the Lord amen now so he's associating the blessing not because it's easy it's easy to look into the life of his parents and even think about all their mistakes that they made before he was born when we get religious and we think that we are righteous we call that the Holy Ghost and we start to look into our parents life and we start to condemn them and we appreciate these people that we watch on Hollywood why some kind of a law of him people that have been divorced four or five times it says well he love his wife that's that's the way Mary is supposed to be you know about it praise the Lord we think now we are so smart because we have gone to school and we have a little certificate I'm not coming I'm not coming to you it's a promise congratulations praise the Lord amen because we think we are smart now we have a little certificate degree in our hands but I used to be that time now it is not like that but we can learn from the prophet the prophecy of Solomon let me close here the Lord give us another time to continue we can learn from the prophet of Solomon to realize that you will never know the amount of prayers that your mama pray just like I said she don't have don't tell me say she's in the message or no I don't want to know that yeah because nature tells me when a child is in the womb of a mother every time she feeds a kick or the pain every expression is a prayer prayer because prayer what is prayer is the utterance of the heart it's not a mouth it's the arteries of the heart when the mother feed patient oh God help me she had just prayed for you she have even lay hands on you before you start going to all of these church and falling in the spirit the first person that lay hands on you or your mama every time she hear her stomach that's the reason why as a young man or the young woman if you despise your parents because now you come to know all their thoughts you know you even know their salary you can take care of you other people are doing this for their children and and me and just this you are using your teeth to dig your grave praise the Lord it's listening towards a war story of a man they had a little girl came by from war it was sick he couldn't care for his girl anymore and at the time they all finishing they were taking a lot of children and uh the place was so full so he took his daughter there and told the people there I'm sick I want to leave her here at the orphanage they said no we I want to take him children whose parents are dead we are not taking children have half parents so the man said he says is that the requirement they say yes he says you take her in few days I will meet that requirement hmm he left his daughter and committed suicide because he wanted a better care he knew that he could not do it that's the heart musicians you can come I've always said if you disrespect your father your parents parents might not be able to get everything right but you think about it have you seen the the Divine Providence of God turn this back on you keep interpreting while you're playing it was in God's Divine Providence his design unique design brought you through those parents he could make you the child of uh uh Donald Trump with a fairly fisted or Bill Gates all the richest men in the world but it was God's design [Music] it was a choice that he made [Music] I don't care what job you have it's very important and how much membership you were never the prophecy of lamel's mother his mother counselor they have now become a prophecy prophecy because he realized that he did not list him to Mama together in the Stillness [Music] just memories I believe that's the condition that Solomon was in the conditions pressure memories started to return back to his mind foreign [Music] preciousness [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is a fool in that second verse together now [Music]
