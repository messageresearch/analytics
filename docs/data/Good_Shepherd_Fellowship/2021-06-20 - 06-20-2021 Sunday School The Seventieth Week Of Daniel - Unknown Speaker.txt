========================================

[Music] so what was it called philadelphia the greatest age of love we've ever had the philadelphian age was ryan john wesley's time when he went out income pentecost and that was lukewarm then we go back and find out what kind of a message would come to the pentecostals at the end remember each one come at the end of the age st paul comes in the rest of them coming out the insane arenas all the rest of them the other ones aged carried over to the other one left over and he take it up went on to the next stage with it see now we find out in this age there's a stars we have there we have a star messenger we have a person a message that goes forth to the age of people to reject it of people to receive it and the messenger of this age was to come in the power of elise and he was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers bring the pentecostal remnant that's left back to the true apostolic faith amen now the true apostolic faith if you'll read it in the book of acts you'll find that there was never one time one person ever baptized the name of father son holy ghost that was never one of them ever sprinkled there was none of this stuff that we have going on today called pentecost that ever happened back there they had true manifestations and the spirit of god among them that was infallibly the son of god working with him this person that was to come forth this message rather that was to come forth to be like elijah elijah was to come three times now you say that john the baptist is that guy if you notice jesus said it was the john the baptist was the messenger of malachi 3 not malachi 4. behold i say my messenger before my face i think matthew 11 6 right down along there you'll find matthew 11 chapter now but in this last days there's to come a spirit of elijah amongst the people he needs to do the same thing that they did back there his nature would be the same thing the nature of the church the nature of the person would be exactly the same thing in that message going on trying he'd be hated by the people he'd hate women honorary ones anyhow bad ones love the wilderness moody upset god all the time like elijah was like john was and we've seen all this thing come to pass if we have had the message we see christ rejected you have to belong to one of these organizations where you can't get into them amen so he's told on the outside yeah christ can't work among them what are you i'm christian what denomination belonged to i don't belong to any we can't use you see he's rejected i see it rejected so was elijah rejected and so was john rejected but what did it hurt them did it hurt their message they said oh you're stiff necks they didn't pull any punches they went right ahead god's message will move right on regardless what anybody said until the consummation and when the that's which is determined shall be poured out and we're at the end down we find ourselves now in 40 years of coming back since the first world war and the jews have returned back to their own land god never did deal with israel until she was in her own land now you remember when the jews was returning back them jews and down in the other nations and the look magazine gave the article of it i read a clipping from some paper some religious magazine that when they them planes went out there to pick up these jews way down in iran and i don't know where all they were they scattered down now that's the true jews they have never had an opportunity uh brother there's your 144 thousand when we get to revelation 11 you'll see him he said there are 12 tribes of gad 12 tribes of ace you're 12 tribes of reuben tribes and where were they all standing on mount sinai amen jews back in the homeland there they were they were the ones that wasn't this wall street crooked bunch no sir it was the real jew and when this old rabbi stood out there and seen this plane land them jews you read it in a magazine there were still plows wooden clouds and when they seen that thing set down out there they wasn't going around it that old rabbi stood out and said remember our prophet said when we go back to our homeland we'll be carried back on the wings of an eagle [Applause] [Music] nations are breaking israel's awakening the signs that the prophets foretold where he didn't fix they hit that seventh week for him i think myself standing out there and my brother petra said on them little testaments and they read him they said well if this be the messiah let us see him do the sign of the prophet if he isn't dead he's alive they said he raised up again he lives in his church let us see him do the sign of the prophet and we'll believe him the jews always believe they know the messiah was to be prophet and when i stood out you know brother oregon writes that day you have to place them jews then they said just come to our place our people i said sure i'll be glad to come just made a decision too quick i got to cairo egypt the other night when i seen that plane coming down there cairo reminded me so when we got back there and i had my ticket to go up to israel he's going to meet me i said go gather up a few thousands of the leaders bring him out on the plane somewhere we find out whether he's still a prophet or not amen hallelujah well let's see what he'll do oh that was just right in their hand that's what they wanted they could see that they'd believe it so what did i do got down there cairo and started to go up there gonna have my ticket about 20 minutes of calling down something said not now the cup of iniquities of the gentiles isn't full yet the amorites hasn't been fulfilled stay out of there i thought maybe i just imagined that i went out behind the hangar and prayed that stay out of there now then i took my ticket went somewhere else i didn't go for the hour isn't yet now what time that god's going to allow those jews to start dealing with them again i cannot tell you i don't know nobody knows that but listen if israel is already in her homeland it's already all the rocks is picked up in the irrigation the waters and everything that god promised they found wells and things there big open streams that that's the most beautiful place you've ever seen they got a city built there they got irrigation they got the best land there is the world there and we find out right in this dead sea there's more chemicals enough to buy the world over see everything's felt right in their hands how did they do it because hitler's heart was hardened miscellaneous heart was hardened just like pharaoh's heart was hardened and driving them back in that land and for four years they've been coming back into that land now there are they set waiting the gentile church is in the lady of sin into the lady of sea and age if the jews are in their homeland already there and the gentile apostasy has already taken place and we have a president like we have we have a nation broke up like we have we have atomic bombs hanging in the hangars we have a church's lukewarm we have a church of people let's pull ourselves together we have a ministry that patterns the ministry of jesus christ for the catch of stone when it comes what's left to happen it might be at any minute there is nothing else left we're at the end time amen all glory i don't know we'll be able to get into that jubilee or not but i just want to want to get part of it to you anyhow listen do you how many can see now do you see where the scripture proves that the 70 weeks is 49 years you see where the 62 weeks is 434 years you see where the the 69 weeks then was was a was uh what was it 800 and 483 years 483 years so this time you see where prince was cut off see you're taking 40-year slam jews to finally get into their place where god said look over here where the gentile age has come through everything that we said it would do what not we said would do what the bible said it would do amen what the bible said it would do come right down to this last age and for 40 years i'm jews has been returning back and you're getting ready for god to do exactly what he did here that went out that way and they come in that way and israel is back in her homeland now when's god going to start there last week wham it may be today it may be before the sun sets tonight god will declare it when it is i don't know i'm wondering but i'm going to bring something here now in a few minutes and i don't know where you go to believe it or not but i i've got to say it anyhow we're at the homeland the jews are in a homeland we're at the end of the age ready for the rapture the rapture comes the church goes up we're caught up to meet him in air we all know that the stone that was cut out of the mountain is ready to come at any time and when it comes what does it do it does away with the gentile age it's all over and god completely quits dealing with them let him as filthy be filthy still that's him it's holy be holy still see what does he do then he takes his church the holy ghost filled what's the filthy that's the sleeping virgin of them it comes up for judgment way over in here we'll get that on another map when we continue this one over where she comes up to the white throne judgment and has to be judged by the redeemed paul told us not to take a matter to court because the saints would judge the earth yes sir that's right we're at the end times here now all right and in the middle of this week now here's the 70 now if these exactly was seven years each one of the weeks and we've already had 69 weeks then we have the gentile age and we're nowhere at the end of the gentile age and there's one more week left for the jew is that right and that's exactly seven years if this was seven years that's seven years because he said there's 70 weeks determined upon thy people so we know we got seven years for the jews is that true now look at it if it's a question i want to know it see now and in the middle of the week the middle of this jewish week see that's three and a half years years the antichrist the prince of prince that is to come and remember he comes out of rome amen the prince that is to come what is he a pope a prince amongst the people that is to come they'll rise up a pharaoh who doesn't know joseph now you protestants say well now that's it but just a minute we find out that the protestants has an organization makes a confederation of churches an image to the beast and go right with them and we find out here that the jews are called in on this that's confederation yes sir and they agreed and the bible said they did and he makes a covenant with them in the midst of the uh 70th week hebrew the antichrist breaks his covenant with the jews thy people why now we read in revelations 11 that are sent at 11 you're coming on world wars 19 now that he will send his uh two prophets and they'll prophesy in that time and then they'll get angry at these prophets and actually kill them is that right and their dead bodies shall lay in the spiritual street called sodom again where our lord was crucified jerusalem is that right and they lay there for three days and nights and after three days and nights the spirit of life will come into them and they'll be raised up and going to glory the 10th part of the city failed at that time is that right see what is that in the middle of this last 70 years when the church fills up then the confederation the sleeping virgin methodist baptist presbyterian lukewarm pentecost all of them together with a confederation which have already got their big regime now and when they do they'll make a covenant that well now this new pope that we got now wants to bring all in can you see the things go together talk on it and bring them all in first time for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years a thousand years or two it's ever been done but now he's to bring him all in together and make a confederation in there the jews will accept it amen amen glory hallelujah praise be to our god list forever there you are my brother is just as simple as simple a little kid could see the confederation of bringing jewish and protestant and catholic together and remember what's these two prophets going to do when they come this beast this prince that shall scatter the power of the holy people what will he do he'll break his covenant with him after three and a half years he'll oust them our people think that's communism that's just because you the spirit of god hasn't dealt with yet it's not communism it's amen the religion said to be so close and deceive the very elected if possible jesus said so see we're in the last now these two prophets what will they do it's moses and elijah amen amen they'll rise on the scene amen they'll tell those jews their mistakes and out of that jewish bunch that's there now to be the 144 thousand god will call with these prophets what is it the spirit of elijah all for this gentile church we'll just continue right on into that jewish church go right on your call moses with him yes sir hallelujah you see it and he'll preach the same message of pentecost to those jews that they rejected the messiah hallelujah amen you see it it'll be the same pentecostal message as these jews will preach right over to them and they'll hate those jews so bad until they'll kill them and they were hated by all nations and in the midst of the week because if they had raised up a great powerful hundred and forty four thousand amen they had the holy ghost and brother you talk about doing miracles they did them they stopped the heavens and it didn't rain the days of their problems smoke the earth was tightened off they wanted to they give plagues and everything else they'll give them romans are a hard way to go but finally they'll be killed our god is a terrible god when he's angered but remember that's over in the 70s weekend the church is in glory amen the wedding supper is going on yes now notice that's where we see her coming back to the millennium temple over here at the end of the jewish age the anointing here he come riding on a white horse those followed him on white horses hoarse powers dressed in white blood or vest your dipped in blood wrote on him the word of god become a body conquer yes sir set up the millennium come into the temple glory i am you said 144 000. now after that 70th week here the 70th week this goes on during the 70th week and the three in the middle of it he breaks it because he kills those two pentecostal prophets amen sir that smites the earth and boy he curses that church and he burns her with fire while she we find her out there eating the shipmates stand out to the last last that great immortal city of rome she come to her end in one hour yes sir she was blown to pieces god knows how to do things and while the angel looked over and said why the blood of every martyr of christ is found in her her deceiving going out here and organizing and making all this other kind of stuff and polluting the church and brought them things in there and martyred the very ones that tried to uphold it and try to bring them out lord glory oh i i don't know i feel like traveling on [Music] see aren't you glad for sunlight walking in the sunlight where are we at brother at the last hour it might happen anytime we're here the message has gone forth for the latter church churches rejected this christ the jews are in their homeland for the spending space of time 40 years the new city has been built they're watching for what a coming messiah when will it be i don't know when that stone smites the image here she's gone it's all over them now notice sharon in the middle of the week three and a half days three and a half years rather it breaks the covenant and causes the sacrifice and goblin that they will have set up already because they'll go right back and say now look you all are churches you can be received in this image and to the beast we'll have a fellowship we'll get rid of communism we'll just swipe communism all the way out see and they can do it see and they'll do it but now watch and set up uh and set up to um this uh the daily worship sacrifice will come back into the city when the temple is rebuilt and this prince that's to come in the middle of this week will break his covenant and do away with this sacrifice as it said he is scattered scattered and why did you and it last on to the consummation and notice the overspreading of abomination to make desolation the over spreading of abomination what is domination filthiness to make desolate what is that to do away with the overspreading of this to do away with that the overspreading of that roman power to conquer all the sleeping virgins jews and all will all be roman or we won't be nothing he'll break his covenant in the middle of the week over spreading all the abomination if it was the abomination of jesus time when iran may come over there with their propaganda it'll be rome again it'll be abomination again to the church to make desolate and shall continue unto the consummation what will he do he'll continue it on onto the consummation that's the end amen now jewish and romanism protestantism that is a sleeping virgin shall consolidate themselves together in the form of the federation of churches and it will be like jesus said in matthew 24 and from revelations 13 14. let's get revelations 13 14 see how i got it marched down here to see what 13 14. all right sir and deceive them that dwell upon the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do consolidating the churches in a sight saying sight of the beast saying unto them that dwell upon the earth that they should make an image unto the beast they had the deadly wound by the sword and did live now we know beyond any shadow of doubt who that beast was that power that had the deadly wound that did live it was when pagan rome was killed and papal rome took its place when pagan power was killed in papul power took his place now now revelations 13 14 jesus matthew 24 warned him of it an image unto the beast paul and second thessalonians the second chapter third and fourth verse let's get it see paul what he says here about that great holy spirit on this great prophet of the lord see what he said about in the last days in second thessalonians the second chapter that's what it is all right sir and begin with the third verse i believe it is all right let's read now listen close everybody how many believes that paul was filled with the holy spirit amen watch earth let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first he's trying to get down their head if he's coming right then so they've got to be a following away from the church first see come over this lady i'll see an age and that man of sin be revealed the man of sin unbelief in the holy ghost unbelief be revealed the son of perdition like judas was treasure the church who opposes and exalts himself above all that's called god are that his worship so that he as god setteth in the temple of god brother is there a person on earth outside of the vatican that does that where's it at i'm going over here in revelations 13 and show you that this man sets on a city in a city and the city sets on on uh seven hills and the numbers of the beast is 666 wrote out in the the latin roman alphabet is 666 is vicarious affiliate delia which is instead of the son of god on a pope's throne and he's got a triple crown and i've looked right at the crown and stood as close as my hand is to my face like that and and seen the deck crown of the pope right there in the vatican myself stood looked at it be sure i know what i was talking about he opposes himself above all it's called god all the godly man he's the holiest of all of them sits in the temple of god just showing himself he is god forgiving sins on earth and so forth you know sure paul said that falling away will have to come first that son of perdition be revealed remember ye not that when i was with you i told you these things oh i'd like to have been sitting there here and paul preached that with you amen i like to listen to him oh man now what's he going to do an image unto the beast second thessalonians now listen listen close now real close the church was already feeling the coming of a pope what is it the end of that church age paul they seen this nickel lady and stuff is rising up he's going to make a holy man so what pope worldliness and aristocrats had creeped into the church and changing the order of worship paul with the holy ghost had caught that in the spirit and the church with his classic dignitaries dignitary personalities and so forth that they seen there was coming something and the holy ghost was warning them of the last days don't you remember how jesus spoke of it the deeds of the nicolaites which finally become a doctrine and then become an organization brother and we're not in darkness now remember see here we are the deeds of the nickelodeons the organizations starting in the great dignitaries over the churches and so forth then farmed into the catholic church and paul said there cannot be an end time there cannot be a time till the falling away from the real pentecostal faith pentecostal faith will be done away with and the dignitaries will be set in they'll have a man they'll take the place of god set in the temple of god unoppose himself above all the people like us see what is it nickel overcoming the laity see always call god he'll sit in this temple of god like god paul said there'd be a falling away first in the last days and here we are right here now and see that falling away and seeing the church getting further and further away from it going right back again and it was the end time all right now if the 69 weeks [Music] [Music] [Music] i bless your name let's play a bless your name [Music]
