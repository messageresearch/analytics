[45:18] a while before we change the order of
[45:20] the service here we have uh
[45:24] uh few announcement and uh prayer
[45:29] request
[45:32] [Music]
[45:34] uh
[45:37] [Music]
[45:48] um well the uh a day of
[45:54] worship with our brother Christen uh uh
[45:58] Cuma from the UK that will be on
[46:03] Saturday
[46:06] uh March
[46:08] 2nd that will be the first Saturday of
[46:11] March and uh uh it's brother there from
[46:16] the UK there a friend to brother area he
[46:20] was uh coming over to visit with him so
[46:23] the plan to use their Saturday night for
[46:27] uh a time of fellowship and praise so uh
[46:32] they are setting up a day of worship
[46:35] that would be the first Saturday in
[46:37] March and uh uh I think they're having
[46:41] some flyers to give out but brother
[46:43] Jordan told me the Flyers will be ready
[46:45] on Wednesday night so beginning
[46:47] Wednesday night next week they will give
[46:50] you Flyers of
[46:52] reminder so uh uh let's uh
[46:57] let just come together and just have a
[46:59] time of
[47:00] worship and uh which of course I think
[47:03] uh definitely we need as uh as as
[47:06] individuals in our lives we need also as
[47:09] a church and uh
[47:12] uh you know uh in I think is there over
[47:17] in the book of Jeremiah Jeremiah warned
[47:20] the people that uh there will be a time
[47:23] where the voice of the bridegroom and
[47:25] and the voice of the Bride deceased from
[47:27] being heard in uh in the city and when
[47:31] he said that he was actually referring
[47:34] to a time of judgment that Israel will
[47:37] be going through but if you really look
[47:39] at that in deep sense is that when when
[47:43] when worship goes away from the people
[47:46] is uh is is is is a sign of of jman you
[47:51] know uh uh uh we we worship worship is
[47:55] it's a sign of Victory it's a sign of
[47:58] Victory and uh so uh let's make use of
[48:02] that uh uh Saturday night the time of
[48:07] Fellowship uh with praise and we have
[48:10] our regular service on Sunday morning
[48:13] but uh uh invite as as many as you can
[48:18] and uh if we have more visitors than we
[48:21] can hold then we will stay out and the
[48:22] visitors will stay in Praise the Lord
[48:25] but let's let's use that time together
[48:28] and then uh also we would like to take a
[48:31] prayer request here for two family that

[52:54] much better than I did during the week
[52:57] so uh
[52:58] uh we we just want
[53:02] to take a thought here this morning I I
[53:05] I remember that I promised I was going
[53:08] to to uh do uh uh something lat uh like
[53:14] I said uh uh a tribute to
[53:20] uh
[53:23] uh a tribute to
[53:26] uh fenny Crosby tomorrow will be uh the
[53:30] day that uh she flew like a do that gift
[53:34] left the word praise the Lord so uh uh
[53:41] uh as we will share with you here fenny
[53:43] Crosby uh she was born uh
[53:49] um in
[53:51] 1820 and she passed in
[53:54] 1915
[53:56] and uh and but the gift in her life she
[54:00] gave
[54:01] us
[54:03] um 8,000 is recorded but more than 8,000
[54:08] hyms and and poay that she
[54:11] wrote what a gift what a what a life but
[54:15] you see as as I was uh last year when I
[54:17] was doing it because uh uh February 12th
[54:21] fell on Sunday so I really wanted to do
[54:24] it on Sunday
[54:26] but then again I think that was when we
[54:28] had brother Crosby from uh
[54:31] uh from the UK preaching for us so I I
[54:36] really couldn't do it so I just read few
[54:38] you know few uh uh quotes that brother
[54:41] Brandon mentioned about her and then uh
[54:45] so uh uh thinking that I would I would
[54:48] still be able to do I really wanted to
[54:50] do it you know I went through a lot of
[54:51] different Cults and different things
[54:53] that she said went through through her
[54:55] her life story and all of that but then
[54:59] uh I got another twist to the whole
[55:03] thing uh I fed on u a book of uh a
[55:07] Jewish American doctor that was born
[55:12] blind and and when I when I read his
[55:17] book it changed my life it it affected
[55:20] me in a way and then I thought no uh
[55:25] this thing I I I wanted to do on fny
[55:28] crossby it it will not be fed I think I
[55:31] I need to find a way but when I read his
[55:34] book actually he was born in Chicago uh
[55:37] uh the the
[55:39] first born blind doctor many Doctor
[55:42] practice blind but this one was born
[55:46] blind and he became a medical
[55:51] doctor and uh uh we will we will we will
[55:55] will mention a little bit about him but
[55:57] I I'll tell you a little bit where how I
[56:00] got to where I got uh to to be able to
[56:02] bring this little talk to you today and
[56:05] uh
[56:06] uh when when I was when I was reading
[56:09] through his book it was a book that I
[56:12] found in the TR store I went over in
[56:14] Savers I was just strolling in
[56:17] Savers uh and then uh I saw the book on
[56:20] the Shelf the blind doctor I said wow
[56:25] let me see what it is I just took it
[56:27] blind
[56:28] doctor you know uh I I just took it and
[56:31] and that was his biography that was that
[56:33] was written and I telling you when I
[56:36] wrote that book I when I read that book
[56:39] I read the book I I every evening when I
[56:43] come home and I and I get into bed I
[56:45] would take the book and I would read I
[56:48] read it with laughter I read it with
[56:52] tears I read it with with
[56:56] uh it was just such a blessing to me it
[57:00] was such a blessing to me I I I'm not be
[57:03] able to tell you everything about it but
[57:05] it it just so when I came to while
[57:09] reading the book then I thought
[57:12] about uh uh what Paul said in Romans and
[57:17] and when he
[57:18] said that uh
[57:22] blindness happened in part
[57:25] to
[57:27] Israel so when he says blindness
[57:30] happening part he was talking about uh
[57:33] uh Israel spiritual
[57:36] blindness
[57:38] then you know I I I also thought about
[57:41] uh uh St John chapter
[57:45] 9 if you if you remember you remember
[57:48] there was the time that I preached on St
[57:50] John chapter 9 it was right around that
[57:52] time I was reading that book
[57:55] because there in St John chapter 9 Jesus
[57:59] said this man it was nothing because
[58:02] that what his father did or his mother
[58:05] did that made him to be born blind he
[58:08] was born blind that God should be
[58:12] glorify so so the book was actually
[58:15] inspiring
[58:16] me and and and and I started looking at
[58:19] blindness not uh not uh uh uh like
[58:26] uh like an impediment I was not looking
[58:28] at blindness anymore you know like a
[58:31] disability I was looking at blind as a
[58:35] gift and that's what fenny crossby would
[58:38] tell you she would tell you that her
[58:41] blindness was a
[58:43] gift that she could have never written
[58:46] those
[58:47] ssongs if she were seeing the things
[58:50] that you are seeing and being
[58:53] distracted
[58:58] praise the
[59:01] Lord at at a place in her life she said
[59:04] if if God will desire to give her her
[59:07] sight she will refuse
[59:13] it uh Dr Jacob said the same
[59:18] thing with all of the things that he
[59:21] could achieve I mean he was a medical
[59:24] doctor highly
[59:26] respected and uh uh uh uh uh he Sav uh
[59:31] even the the US uh uh uh uh uh uh
[59:37] military you know uh uh at the time uh
[59:40] of one uh one of the overseas W and and
[59:44] uh you know there was the outbreak of uh
[59:46] Clorox and all of that I mean uh and and
[59:50] and and so forth so this morning we are
[59:53] taking a little break here so I'm not
[59:57] I'm not doing this uh uh uh directly to
[1:00:01] uh
[1:00:03] uh fny Crosby as I as I would like to do
[1:00:07] but I I bring a message out of it but
[1:00:10] I'll take three characters that I want
[1:00:12] to uh uh uh talk about before we get
[1:00:15] into our message that will be fenny
[1:00:17] Crosby and there's another lady called
[1:00:21] the Helen
[1:00:23] killer
[1:00:25] Helen killer also she was born blind and
[1:00:30] deaf but she got a
[1:00:32] teacher that taught her from
[1:00:36] small sign language that that's that's
[1:00:40] one of the uh the American very powerful
[1:00:45] home movie you watch with your
[1:00:48] kids how their teacher was determined
[1:00:53] for killer to be able to to read and
[1:00:58] write and uh uh which of course she was
[1:01:03] able to rein write went to school got
[1:01:07] out with a bachelor's of art
[1:01:10] degree and she became an advocate a
[1:01:15] lecturer praise the
[1:01:19] Lord so this morning we want to speak on
[1:01:23] uh I I entitled my message the
[1:01:28] mystery blindness imp
[1:01:31] part I wanted to call it this mystery
[1:01:34] I've been I was thinking uh I say the
[1:01:37] mystery of blindness no it would not be
[1:01:39] it would not sound right because I'm I'm
[1:01:42] taking something that Paul spoke about
[1:01:46] that Paul identify as a
[1:01:49] mster and in in in uh uh uh uh sh w this
[1:01:55] when brother Brandon was listing all the
[1:01:57] Mysteries that were to be
[1:02:00] revealed this mystery was the second
[1:02:04] mystery the mystery of Israel
[1:02:07] blindness praise the Lord now but this
[1:02:10] morning we're not talking about the
[1:02:12] mystery of Israel blindness I'm not
[1:02:14] going to go into the mystery of Israel
[1:02:17] blindness but I'm I'm I'm I'm using that
[1:02:20] as as a title I will talk a little bit
[1:02:23] about Israel blindness but I'm not
[1:02:25] dwelling on that what I want to to to
[1:02:28] talk about is that the mystery blindness
[1:02:34] impart praise the Lord amen because as
[1:02:39] as we as will realize as we look here
[1:02:42] and see it is that there is there is a
[1:02:46] there's a group of people that
[1:02:49] experience blindness in
[1:02:51] part and there's a group of people that
[1:02:54] experienced blindness in
[1:02:58] hold praise the Lord now because I think
[1:03:02] when Paul said blindness imp part
[1:03:06] happened to
[1:03:08] Israel he was he was identifying a
[1:03:11] period of time where they went
[1:03:14] blind
[1:03:16] amen and after they went
[1:03:18] blind they got their
[1:03:21] sight so it's it's a part it's a partial
[1:03:25] blindness or a part in their life a part
[1:03:28] in their
[1:03:32] history but also if there is a blindness
[1:03:36] in
[1:03:37] part there is also a blindness in
[1:03:43] whole praise the
[1:03:46] Lord that is what I want for us to also
[1:03:49] be be conscious of as we go into this so
[1:03:53] if if uh as we will trust the Lord to uh
[1:03:58] to help us this
[1:04:03] morning let's let's stand to our feet
[1:04:07] we'll do
[1:04:08] uh a pretty long reading this
[1:04:13] morning or maybe we can
[1:04:17] read uh Romans chapter 11 then you take
[1:04:21] your seat then I'll do the long reading
[1:04:23] since since I'm the one that's supposed
[1:04:25] to stand up the
[1:04:30] longest so let's let's read Romans 11 I
[1:04:33] will have love for us to read Genesis
[1:04:36] and get to Romans but let's read Romans
[1:04:38] 11 and then you can take the comfort of
[1:04:41] your
[1:04:43] seat standing up long is part of my my
[1:04:47] my job
[1:04:50] Dy praise the
[1:04:53] Lord
[1:05:00] Romans chapter 11 verse
[1:05:03] 25 Romans 11 verse
[1:05:09] 25 Romans
[1:05:16] 11:25 for our who not
[1:05:19] Brethren that ye should be ignorant of
[1:05:23] this mystery now that's what I wanted to
[1:05:26] use this mystery blindness imp part this
[1:05:30] mystery I think I would change
[1:05:37] it for I will not Brethren that you
[1:05:40] should be ignorant of this
[1:05:43] mystery least ye should be wise in your
[1:05:47] own concept that blindness impact is
[1:05:51] happened to Israel until till the
[1:05:55] fullness of the Gentile become
[1:05:59] In Praise the Lord the Lord bless you
[1:06:02] you can have your seat while we turn to
[1:06:05] Genesis
[1:06:07] 48 Genesis 48 we'll pretty much read the
[1:06:10] entire
[1:06:12] chapter
[1:06:20] uh Genesis 48 we'll read read the entire
[1:06:37] chapter are we together praise the Lord
[1:06:41] and it came to pass after these things
[1:06:44] th th one told Joseph Behold thy father
[1:06:47] is sake and he took with him his two
[1:06:52] sons maned and ephra
[1:06:54] and one told Jacob and said behold thy
[1:06:57] son Joseph cometh unto the and Israel
[1:07:03] strengthened himself and sat upon his
[1:07:07] bed and Jacob said unto
[1:07:12] Joseph God Almighty appeared unto me in
[1:07:16] L in the land of Canaan and blessed me
[1:07:18] and said unto me behold I will make thee
[1:07:21] fruitful and multiply thee in I will
[1:07:24] make thee a multitude of people and will
[1:07:28] give this land to thy seed after thee
[1:07:31] for an everlasting possession and now
[1:07:35] thy two sons ephran and man which were
[1:07:39] born unto thee in the land of Egypt
[1:07:42] before I came unto thee into Egypt are
[1:07:47] mine as Ruben and Simeon they shall be
[1:07:51] mine right there Jacob was adopting the
[1:07:55] two sons of
[1:07:57] Joseph now so you see because of that
[1:08:02] Israel never run out of a 12
[1:08:06] tribe praise the Lord
[1:08:09] amen if uh if if uh uh
[1:08:15] uh if you come to the Tabernacle where
[1:08:18] the
[1:08:19] Levites uh uh the Levites were were were
[1:08:24] separated to the Lord and uh the sons of
[1:08:30] uh of Joseph were counted in the tribes
[1:08:33] of
[1:08:34] Israel to keep them as 12 if you are
[1:08:38] counting the tribe by the sons of Jacob
[1:08:42] then Joseph is counted in as a
[1:08:46] tribe praise the Lord amen that's the
[1:08:50] reason why in most in most
[1:08:54] history after Genesis you don't hear the
[1:08:57] Trap of Joseph but you hear the Trap of
[1:09:01] Ephron and
[1:09:02] Manet why because the Levites were taken
[1:09:07] by
[1:09:08] God so Joseph was not counted as a tribe
[1:09:13] but his two sons were counted so Israel
[1:09:16] never lost a 12
[1:09:18] tribe why because Jacob is adopting the
[1:09:23] sons of Joseph praise the Lord they will
[1:09:26] be unto me as Ruben and Simeon and Ruben
[1:09:30] and Simeon came from
[1:09:32] Leah if you if you follow the songs
[1:09:35] there the issue which thou Beed after
[1:09:40] them shall be D it ISS uh if you have
[1:09:46] any songs later they will be yours and
[1:09:48] i' all I've always believed that you
[1:09:51] have your first child here for your
[1:09:52] parents then you can have start having
[1:09:59] yours that that just me
[1:10:03] no amen and I issue which thou be geted
[1:10:07] after them shall be dine and shall be
[1:10:10] called after thy name after the name of
[1:10:13] their brethren
[1:10:15] in their
[1:10:18] inheritance praise the Lord and then he
[1:10:22] went over he went over the entire
[1:10:24] history here telling telling Joseph you
[1:10:27] know uh uh uh as for me when I came to
[1:10:31] Pam Rachel Died By Me In the Land of
[1:10:34] Canan in the way when yet there was uh
[1:10:38] but a little way to come unto ephra I
[1:10:42] bury her there in the word of ephra the
[1:10:44] same is bethem and Israel beheld
[1:10:47] Joseph's sons and said who are these and
[1:10:51] Joseph said unto his father they are my
[1:10:54] sons whom God have given me in this
[1:10:57] place and he said bring them I prayed
[1:11:01] thee unto me and I will bless
[1:11:04] them now the eyes of Israel were deemed
[1:11:09] for age so that he could not see
[1:11:13] blindness in
[1:11:17] part praise the Lord that's that is
[1:11:20] something that I want for us to to
[1:11:23] realize here
[1:11:25] Paul is is uh is is making us to see
[1:11:30] something that he called a mist and and
[1:11:34] and a mist is uh is is is is is God's
[1:11:38] own secret something that God did to be
[1:11:41] able to hide his
[1:11:44] purpose praise the Lord something that
[1:11:47] God
[1:11:50] allowed and just like when we were
[1:11:52] talking about the the patriarch mothers
[1:11:55] there was something that we found of
[1:11:58] them Sarah was
[1:12:00] barring Rebecca was Barren Rachel was
[1:12:05] Barren God that told Moses there would
[1:12:09] be no baroness but yet he had baroness
[1:12:14] in the mother of the patriarch and we
[1:12:16] know it was for a
[1:12:18] purpose and here is the same thing also
[1:12:21] now we seeing that God
[1:12:24] God gave Israel blindness in
[1:12:29] part Isaac was
[1:12:32] blind Jacob here is experiencing
[1:12:34] blindness
[1:12:37] also so there is something about this
[1:12:40] that God is hiding his Divine
[1:12:44] Purpose he's putting his Divine Purpose
[1:12:48] in this as much as it looks like
[1:12:51] something that is scary to us all
[1:12:55] wow how will God promise Abraham to be a
[1:12:59] father of nation and then his wife is
[1:13:03] Barren why would God do that except he
[1:13:06] had a
[1:13:13] reason are you grapping the
[1:13:18] picture he has a
[1:13:21] reason so the Bible says here now the
[1:13:24] eyes of Israel were D verse 10 for a so
[1:13:28] that he could not see and he brought
[1:13:32] them near unto him and he kissed them
[1:13:35] and embraced them and Israel said unto
[1:13:37] Jacob I I have not taught to see thee to
[1:13:42] see thy face and L God have showed me
[1:13:46] also thy seed and Joseph brought them
[1:13:49] out from uh between his knees and and
[1:13:52] and bowed himself on onto on onto the
[1:13:55] and and bow himself with his face to the
[1:13:57] Earth BL you take
[1:14:01] time and Joseph took them both
[1:14:04] Ephron in his right hand towards Israel
[1:14:09] left
[1:14:11] hand and Manish it in his left hand
[1:14:15] towards Israel right
[1:14:19] hand and brought them near unto
[1:14:22] him
[1:14:23] and Israel stretched out his hand now
[1:14:28] what what I want us to grab here what I
[1:14:31] want us to grab here is
[1:14:34] that Paul said blindness happened to
[1:14:39] isra in
[1:14:41] part as he's talking about Israel in our
[1:14:46] mind we can think about the
[1:14:49] nation praise the Lord but what I want
[1:14:52] you to for us to First thing about is
[1:14:54] the man
[1:14:56] Israel which is
[1:15:00] Jacob because Paul what Paul is
[1:15:03] referring to as a mystery is what took
[1:15:06] place right
[1:15:07] here what took place right here here the
[1:15:11] secret of Israel
[1:15:16] Redemption praise the
[1:15:18] Lord amen he's talking about the nation
[1:15:22] Israel
[1:15:24] but before they came to be the nation
[1:15:26] Israel it was one man that rise up with
[1:15:30] God it was a man that met God on the
[1:15:34] backside of the
[1:15:35] desert and he h on to God and said you
[1:15:38] have to bless
[1:15:41] me praise the
[1:15:43] Lord
[1:15:45] amen and the angel said your name will
[1:15:48] no no more be called Jacob but you will
[1:15:51] be called Israel
[1:15:55] are we
[1:15:57] together so you see a mystery a mystery
[1:16:01] does not just fly from in the air it's
[1:16:04] not something that is pick up the
[1:16:06] prophets of old when when they were talk
[1:16:09] about a mystery is something that is
[1:16:11] hidden in the word that's the reason why
[1:16:13] brother Bram said you know the the the
[1:16:16] the the the mistress that will be
[1:16:18] revealed it cannot be something that is
[1:16:20] that is extra from what is in the word
[1:16:23] it has to be in the
[1:16:25] word so when Mo when when when Paul was
[1:16:29] saying I don't want you to be ignorant
[1:16:32] of this
[1:16:33] mystery what he's seeing that make
[1:16:36] Israel to reject their Messiah from that
[1:16:39] make Israel to be
[1:16:41] blind the nation Israel to be blind to
[1:16:45] say we have no no King but Caesar they
[1:16:48] deny their own King they said crucify
[1:16:52] him what made them to do that was hidden
[1:16:56] in the life of Israel right
[1:17:01] here what made them to do that was the
[1:17:04] same thing that make Israel to cross his
[1:17:11] hands are you seeing the picture so when
[1:17:15] he says blindness happen in
[1:17:20] part I don't want you to be ignorant of
[1:17:22] this
[1:17:24] that blindness happened in part until
[1:17:27] the time of the Gentiles will come
[1:17:30] in when you look back into the life of
[1:17:34] our father Jacob uh H H uh uh blindness
[1:17:39] happening
[1:17:40] part you think about it Joseph bringing
[1:17:44] his sons to his father he said them in
[1:17:47] in his mind this is the first B this is
[1:17:50] the second B I've said them right here
[1:17:52] no this is the first Bor because he will
[1:17:54] go to my daddy's right hand this is the
[1:17:56] second Bor he will go to my daddy left
[1:17:58] left hand you know he plac it in order
[1:18:00] he brought the boys right
[1:18:05] there and Jacob turned his
[1:18:08] hands
[1:18:11] around praise the
[1:18:17] Lord and even in the scripture he cried
[1:18:20] and said father no it's not that way you
[1:18:23] you're supposed to do it this
[1:18:25] way he said
[1:18:28] no God is the one that turned my
[1:18:32] hands praise the
[1:18:34] Lord are we together are you seeing the
[1:18:38] picture so what Paul was referring
[1:18:43] to was what took place in the life of
[1:18:48] Israel and
[1:18:50] because it happened in the life of the
[1:18:53] man Israel the nation Israel will also
[1:18:57] experience
[1:19:00] it praise the
[1:19:04] Lord are we
[1:19:11] together and we could take types and and
[1:19:13] and just like we did uh uh when we were
[1:19:16] looking at uh uh the mystery of of
[1:19:20] baroness like I would call it
[1:19:23] why would God allowed baroness to be
[1:19:26] seen in the picture of mother it's the
[1:19:30] same reason we come to a scripture here
[1:19:32] that will that will help us to be able
[1:19:34] to look at that together so we want to
[1:19:37] talk about uh uh uh this
[1:19:42] mystery blindness
[1:19:45] impart this mystery blindness imp
[1:19:49] part so just like I said before we go uh
[1:19:55] uh uh any further let's just go through
[1:20:00] the life of these of these uh different
[1:20:05] individuals that uh they have inspired
[1:20:08] us to come to this
[1:20:11] thought Let's uh let's look at the life
[1:20:14] of uh fenny Crosby that will be our our
[1:20:17] second quote that's that's the second
[1:20:20] slide no yep
[1:20:25] praise the
[1:20:33] Lord Brother Braham spoke about her we
[1:20:36] are all familiar with
[1:20:39] that praise the
[1:20:41] Lord I sure thought I came up came out
[1:20:44] with my app pointers
[1:20:47] okay and uh
[1:20:51] uh
[1:20:57] a tremendous
[1:20:59] life she said yet it
[1:21:02] seems intended
[1:21:05] by the Blessed Providence of God that I
[1:21:09] should be blind all my
[1:21:12] life and I thank him
[1:21:16] for the
[1:21:18] dispensation if perfect eff sight were
[1:21:22] offer me tomorrow I will not accept
[1:21:25] it I might not have sunk hymns to praise
[1:21:30] to the praise of God if I had been
[1:21:34] distracted by the beautiful and
[1:21:36] interesting things about
[1:21:40] me praise the
[1:21:44] Lord and that is not only it with one
[1:21:49] that is blind what we have to realize
[1:21:52] that the Bible says we are made for his
[1:21:57] purpose praise the lord we are made for
[1:22:01] his
[1:22:02] purpose Isaiah chapter 53 the Bible says
[1:22:06] it pleased
[1:22:08] God that he should be bruised he should
[1:22:12] be rejected a pleased
[1:22:16] God praise the Lord and when a person
[1:22:20] can come to the place and
[1:22:23] realize that whatever state that God has
[1:22:28] placed them in is it's not that you are
[1:22:30] just accepting it because you feel
[1:22:33] defeated no you are accepting it because
[1:22:36] you
[1:22:38] understand you understand that you are
[1:22:41] called to this right you are not
[1:22:44] accepting it because yeah everybody is
[1:22:46] becoming well yeah my own I'm just no
[1:22:50] that
[1:22:51] surrounder
[1:22:53] right you are surrounding to the
[1:22:55] situation you are not happy nobody that
[1:22:58] surrounder in war is happy
[1:23:01] right they are not happy they are
[1:23:03] captured by by uh by their enemies and
[1:23:07] they are just giving in that's not what
[1:23:10] we are talking
[1:23:11] about but when a person has has come to
[1:23:14] a place of understanding realizing in a
[1:23:18] way that God is leading them and God is
[1:23:21] dealing them that this is the place that
[1:23:23] God has set them to be and God have
[1:23:26] placed them in this position to be a
[1:23:31] blessing praise the
[1:23:43] Lord are we
[1:23:51] together
[1:23:53] she was born blind as as her life story
[1:23:55] would tell sometime in her
[1:23:58] life she was able to find love and she
[1:24:01] got married sometime in her
[1:24:05] life she had a
[1:24:07] child but then she lost her
[1:24:11] child praise the Lord that was when she
[1:24:14] wrote the song save in the arm of
[1:24:17] Jesus save in his tender
[1:24:21] embrace
[1:24:22] praise the
[1:24:24] Lord a tremendous life when she came out
[1:24:28] of there she gave herself to more
[1:24:32] dedication it it is it is enough at a
[1:24:35] place where she could be
[1:24:37] frustrated and says uh uh uh you know uh
[1:24:41] uh the only person that could tell me
[1:24:43] and everything around me you took them
[1:24:44] away from
[1:24:47] me but she did not question her
[1:24:50] maker she contining to praise God she
[1:24:54] Contin to write she find comfort and
[1:24:57] strength in inspiring
[1:25:01] others praise the
[1:25:03] Lord she even went over to the US
[1:25:06] Congress to to advocate for blind
[1:25:10] schools and uh uh for blind children to
[1:25:13] go to
[1:25:21] school pray praise the
[1:25:23] Lord Brother Brandon will say this about
[1:25:27] her sorry I try to force that that cope
[1:25:30] there because I was trying to make my
[1:25:32] notes a little bit uh
[1:25:37] uh smaller instead of just adding a lot
[1:25:41] of he says then and then when when Fanny
[1:25:45] crossed be one day when they when they
[1:25:48] come to to her with their big bagging
[1:25:53] she was P to and they
[1:25:55] come to her and said we will give so
[1:25:59] much if you will just give your talent
[1:26:03] over to uh making Sons for the the the
[1:26:09] entertainment word she flatly
[1:26:13] refused praise the
[1:26:15] Lord
[1:26:21] amen she will not do it she said if if
[1:26:25] there's anything there I have it belongs
[1:26:28] to
[1:26:29] Christ and so they The Men Who were
[1:26:33] talking to her said then I suppose that
[1:26:36] you are expecting to go to a world where
[1:26:39] there is everlasting life and so forth
[1:26:42] and said so what do you expect this
[1:26:45] Christ to be what what are they thinking
[1:26:49] they are thinking that you need an eyes
[1:26:51] to seek
[1:26:53] Christ so they are trying now to make
[1:26:55] mockery out of her you are sinking for
[1:26:58] the Christ that will not give you your
[1:27:06] sight praise the
[1:27:10] Lord and I've always said
[1:27:13] this you know uh uh uh if you make if
[1:27:17] you if you if you make your problem that
[1:27:19] you are dealing with bigger than God
[1:27:23] you're going to worship that
[1:27:26] problem and you can only serve
[1:27:29] God how much you know him you can never
[1:27:33] serve God above the way you know him
[1:27:36] neither below the way you know him right
[1:27:39] the way you will serve God and be
[1:27:41] dedicated to God is how much you know
[1:27:44] him but I can say there is more of God
[1:27:47] to
[1:27:48] know praise the Lord there is more of
[1:27:51] God God beyond our knowledge to
[1:27:55] know he's the he's the god that want
[1:27:58] time fill every
[1:28:01] space praise the Lord and I believe he's
[1:28:04] here this
[1:28:11] morning so they are speaking to this
[1:28:13] woman and saying I'm supposed you are
[1:28:16] you are expecting to go to a world where
[1:28:18] there is everlasting life say yes what
[1:28:22] so what do you expect this Christ to be
[1:28:25] said he will be a man and said then if
[1:28:30] you if you are the same over there as
[1:28:34] you are yet said uh you did never see
[1:28:38] him said you are blind she said oh I
[1:28:43] will know him
[1:28:46] anyhow so they they said how will you
[1:28:50] ever know him if you are I stay blind
[1:28:52] over there as you never have sight in
[1:28:57] this
[1:28:59] life and on the other side if you have
[1:29:02] no sight there how will you know him you
[1:29:05] you see the thing there is that the it's
[1:29:08] not it's not like Comfort they are
[1:29:10] trying to bring to her uh uh uh in one
[1:29:14] sense they are trying to Mark her
[1:29:16] because of her stand they are trying to
[1:29:18] scoff at her not only scoffing at her
[1:29:22] but scoffing that what you are believing
[1:29:24] is not truth amen because it's more like
[1:29:27] what you are believing is not even
[1:29:29] producing the result that you should
[1:29:33] have praise the
[1:29:40] Lord and then and all of these things
[1:29:43] have have have breeded out our our our
[1:29:47] uh how you call it now it had breathed
[1:29:50] out our prosperity
[1:29:52] gospel because uh it's all based on the
[1:29:55] fact that if it is God that created the
[1:29:58] the the universe and God that own
[1:30:00] everything so we should own the whole
[1:30:02] word the word should be shining on
[1:30:06] Us Praise the
[1:30:11] Lord but that's not the principle that
[1:30:14] God choose to
[1:30:18] work are we together
[1:30:25] we're living in such an age that has
[1:30:27] reduced God to material
[1:30:33] things Our God Is Bigger Than
[1:30:36] That
[1:30:40] amen our our our our purpose that we are
[1:30:44] called is for him to be reflected in
[1:30:49] Us Praise the Lord
[1:30:54] for him to be reflected in us that man
[1:30:57] will see his good work in us and glorify
[1:31:00] Our Father in
[1:31:06] heaven so they are saying all of these
[1:31:08] things to her and uh as as as he goes on
[1:31:12] here they laugh at her and she turned
[1:31:15] and started through the house when uh
[1:31:18] she had made her decision no sir nothing
[1:31:21] of the this word all my talent is given
[1:31:24] to Christ she started back across the
[1:31:27] house and raised up her hand and she
[1:31:29] said I will I shall know him I shall
[1:31:32] know him and redeem by his side I shall
[1:31:36] stand I shall know him I shall know him
[1:31:39] praise the Lord if I don't see him with
[1:31:41] my eyes by the prints of the nails in
[1:31:44] his hands I will identify him praise the
[1:31:47] Lord Amen brother Bram said is in those
[1:31:51] great CW crucial
[1:31:53] moving the stram is put upon us that God
[1:31:58] Moves
[1:31:59] In Praise the Lord when it looks like
[1:32:03] everything is against
[1:32:05] you praise the Lord everything is
[1:32:09] against you and you are not goinging by
[1:32:12] everything you are still standing for
[1:32:17] Christ praise the
[1:32:20] Lord
[1:32:23] he say he's not going to pass us through
[1:32:25] a a tube and bring us on the other side
[1:32:27] and say You have
[1:32:31] overcome we have something to
[1:32:34] overcome it's in those crucial moment
[1:32:37] the strength is upon us that he moves in
[1:32:40] when we make the decision for
[1:32:42] him that's between life and
[1:32:46] death there little sharp edge sometime
[1:32:50] at the last moment when you think you
[1:32:53] are not going to get well and somebody
[1:32:57] making fun of you still hold to your
[1:33:01] testimony it is the time that God moves
[1:33:07] in amen am we are in uh h h a culture
[1:33:11] that is all about pleasing
[1:33:15] people pleasing
[1:33:19] people now so this is uh this is uh
[1:33:24] uh fny
[1:33:27] Crosby let's take uh Helen
[1:33:32] killer just like I said this little
[1:33:35] little girl was born blind and also born
[1:33:40] deaf and uh uh
[1:33:43] uh and her dad got
[1:33:46] her a lady that came in and this lady
[1:33:49] was
[1:33:50] determined that she would help killer to
[1:33:54] be able to to to gravitate towards the
[1:33:58] the the sound
[1:34:00] language and she will communicate with
[1:34:03] her as she will as she will teach her
[1:34:05] the sound language and teach her you
[1:34:08] know the sign for different things she
[1:34:10] would say those words to
[1:34:13] her praise the
[1:34:18] Lord and she became a great
[1:34:22] American
[1:34:24] Author a political artivist
[1:34:29] lecturer she was the first blind deaf
[1:34:32] person to earn a bachelor uh Bachelor of
[1:34:35] art
[1:34:36] degree praise the
[1:34:39] Lord a remarkable
[1:34:43] Altar and she left us with these few I
[1:34:46] took few of her
[1:34:47] quotes that she left us
[1:34:50] w
[1:34:52] she said the best and most beautiful
[1:34:55] things in this word cannot be seen or
[1:35:00] touched they must be felt with their
[1:35:05] heart the beautiful thing the best and
[1:35:09] beautiful things in this world they
[1:35:11] cannot be
[1:35:12] touched they must be filled with a
[1:35:20] heart
[1:35:22] she said alone we can do so little
[1:35:25] together we can do so
[1:35:27] much life is either a daring Adventure
[1:35:32] or nothing at
[1:35:34] all praise the
[1:35:36] Lord you must be brave to do what you
[1:35:40] want to do
[1:35:43] amen you must be brave to stand for what
[1:35:46] is right sir sometimes you might have
[1:35:50] nobody there to encourage you you that's
[1:35:52] the reason why it must become a
[1:35:54] revelation to
[1:36:02] you timism is the faith that leads to
[1:36:06] achievement nothing can be done without
[1:36:09] hope and
[1:36:11] confidence keep your face in the
[1:36:14] sunshine and you cannot see a
[1:36:19] shadow if you keep your face in the
[1:36:21] sunshine I was reading uh h a book uh of
[1:36:25] uh of uh guy that wrote on Helen Kell in
[1:36:29] one of his book and when he first met
[1:36:31] her he he wrote this thing he said that
[1:36:34] uh they met in Jerusalem she went down
[1:36:36] to visit the Tomb of
[1:36:39] Jesus and he was there at the very same
[1:36:41] time as a young
[1:36:43] preacher and then uh she was coming out
[1:36:47] of the Tomb when he just got there so he
[1:36:49] heard somebody talking and then uh uh uh
[1:36:53] and and and he was so fond of reading
[1:36:55] her books and then when she came out of
[1:36:58] the
[1:36:59] Tomb he said she lifted her hands just
[1:37:04] when she came out and she said there is
[1:37:07] no Darkness
[1:37:09] here praise the
[1:37:11] Lord amen a blind woman she can see she
[1:37:18] can tell Darkness from light but coming
[1:37:21] from from the Tomb of Jesus she said
[1:37:23] there is no Darkness here praise the
[1:37:28] Lord
[1:37:30] amen and that's what our faith
[1:37:33] reveals there is no darkness in Christ
[1:37:35] that's what John
[1:37:37] said if we if we say we walk in the
[1:37:40] light and we are in darkness he said we
[1:37:42] deceive
[1:37:43] ourself there is no darkness in
[1:37:49] Christ so she was not speaking from what
[1:37:52] she could see with her eyes she was
[1:37:54] speaking from what she could
[1:37:57] feel with her heart there is no Darkness
[1:38:09] here and I'll testify of my
[1:38:13] friend the blind
[1:38:17] doctor Jacob parents had children
[1:38:22] and they had succession of blind
[1:38:24] children so when Jacob was
[1:38:28] born just like you see his eyes he was
[1:38:31] born with his eyes open so his mother
[1:38:34] was so convinced that Jacob could
[1:38:38] see because his eyes was open and it was
[1:38:41] just moving back and forth so she was so
[1:38:45] convinced that the child could
[1:38:48] see
[1:38:50] until Jacob started
[1:38:55] crying and and and and and then also
[1:38:58] when he was born he was born a very
[1:39:00] active Child full of action laughing and
[1:39:04] he was just just active so he he he he
[1:39:07] started moving very
[1:39:09] early so when he started crying and then
[1:39:13] he started bumping into things his
[1:39:15] mother got so afraid she got so afraid
[1:39:19] that her worst night may have fall upon
[1:39:22] her again she has a blind child she said
[1:39:25] no no no she cried no they had to take
[1:39:29] him to the doctor then the doctor will
[1:39:32] confirm that Jacob was born
[1:39:36] blind she was so
[1:39:39] tall but he was such a
[1:39:42] sunshine because you couldn't stop
[1:39:45] him he he he bump into this he knows
[1:39:48] that he can't go there he com here and
[1:39:50] he was just all over the
[1:39:52] place he was just so
[1:39:56] fast and that's how
[1:40:00] uh uh one of the robber they were a
[1:40:04] Jewish
[1:40:06] Family one of the robber would come and
[1:40:09] talk to Jacob father his next brother to
[1:40:13] him was also blind so the the the Rober
[1:40:17] would would tell Jacob father that look
[1:40:22] you can you you can say here and and
[1:40:24] just feel so sorry for your children or
[1:40:27] else you can send them off which of
[1:40:30] course that is something that Jacob
[1:40:33] mother would not agree to but he was
[1:40:35] telling Jacob father you can send them
[1:40:37] off there's a blind School somewhere
[1:40:40] they can go and learn in all of that the
[1:40:43] dad struggle with it for my boys they
[1:40:45] can already see send them away we're
[1:40:47] going to take care of them you know he
[1:40:50] worried about dad but then finally he
[1:40:54] decided so they had to plan this thing
[1:40:56] against the mother that will pack things
[1:40:59] for the boys and take them away on the
[1:41:02] train right on the train Jacob was all
[1:41:04] over the place bumping into people you
[1:41:07] know uh uh uh you know at the time he
[1:41:10] was walking you know and and uh and he
[1:41:15] had he had a a a a a kind of a
[1:41:20] photographic
[1:41:22] memory I mean you can you can set you
[1:41:24] can you can set Jacob down and when you
[1:41:27] are reading he just he just suck it in I
[1:41:30] mean he suck it in that he can repeat to
[1:41:33] you word by
[1:41:35] word exactly what you
[1:41:39] said a gift was
[1:41:41] born a gift was born into the
[1:41:46] word the first blind medical doctor
[1:41:52] he does his diagnosis by listening to to
[1:41:55] the patient he put his ears on your
[1:41:58] stomach or on your heart and he will
[1:42:00] tell you
[1:42:02] exactly and that's not now one now one
[1:42:05] the diagnostic have ever

[1:45:34] went blind so Jacob went to this doctor
[1:45:37] the doctor told Jacob your case is
[1:45:40] different I was not born
[1:45:42] blind but you were born
[1:45:45] blind son you can't do this you got to
[1:45:48] think about something else
[1:45:51] praise the Lord let's let's just read uh
[1:45:55] uh Jacob cot here I I need to preach I
[1:45:58] need to preach you want a book I can
[1:46:00] borrow it to
[1:46:03] you Jacob said Vision does not depend on
[1:46:07] eyes the true vision is
[1:46:10] insight and that is seen with the mind
[1:46:15] and the
[1:46:17] Heart praise the
[1:46:19] Lord the first blind physician to
[1:46:22] practice medic to practice medicine
[1:46:25] independently he had his own
[1:46:28] Clinic he was not working on people
[1:46:31] people were working on
[1:46:37] him he had his own
[1:46:40] Clinic look it's God that have cut our
[1:46:44] life
[1:46:49] path
[1:46:52] when the prophet said show me a man and
[1:46:54] show me the woman that will put God
[1:46:56] first in their life I will show you a
[1:46:59] person that will
[1:47:02] prosper it's God that have cut our life
[1:47:05] path there is no shortcut to
[1:47:11] success and you can never make yourself
[1:47:14] what God did not make
[1:47:16] you no matter how hard you
[1:47:19] try
[1:47:26] the first blind physician to practice
[1:47:28] medicine independently is remembered not
[1:47:31] only for his medical
[1:47:33] achievement but also for his inspiring
[1:47:39] views one notable CT attribute to him is
[1:47:43] it is not enough to tell me that I
[1:47:46] cannot achieve my dreams because I am
[1:47:53] blind if the the
[1:47:55] moment if you can give Jacob a
[1:47:58] reason why he can do it explain it but
[1:48:01] if you tell him because you are blind
[1:48:05] you bring out that that uh righteous
[1:48:09] indignation in
[1:48:11] him and he will prove you wrong he
[1:48:14] started the first American blind Boy
[1:48:17] Scout
[1:48:19] God go and search it out Google gave us
[1:48:22] 100 of free information go and search it
[1:48:25] out there is nothing that you can't want
[1:48:27] you you want you fine some are there
[1:48:29] true some are there
[1:48:34] false it is not enough to tell me that I
[1:48:37] cannot
[1:48:39] achieve my dream because I'm blind you
[1:48:43] must also tell me that if I were not
[1:48:46] blind then I could achieve my
[1:48:49] dreams so what is he
[1:48:55] saying is it because I'm blind I can't
[1:48:57] do it if I was not blind will I just do
[1:49:00] it will it just happen
[1:49:04] automatically without me having a dream
[1:49:07] without me having something to inspire
[1:49:10] me to do it if I were not
[1:49:13] blind it's not the eyes that do it it's
[1:49:17] the drive that is inside it's the
[1:49:19] conviction that is
[1:49:25] inside praise the
[1:49:29] Lord men of all they set up alone
[1:49:33] independently to bring the gospel those
[1:49:36] men travel on he back they went to
[1:49:38] different places see how the disciples
[1:49:40] went around the world carrying the
[1:49:42] Gospel of Jesus Christ to Hidden
[1:49:48] countries brother brand with his poor
[1:49:51] life and poor
[1:49:52] education could stand in the in in in in
[1:49:55] the midst of Theologian when the word
[1:49:58] has rised to such a
[1:50:01] level and there were men on the field
[1:50:03] that that that were part of writing the
[1:50:05] lamb Bible and all of that but he stood
[1:50:09] with his
[1:50:14] conviction praise the
[1:50:16] Lord he knew an angel met him yeah he
[1:50:20] was not making up stories he was not
[1:50:23] looking for people
[1:50:26] sympathy he was turning by his
[1:50:29] conviction he said tell
[1:50:31] me if you tell me that I can't do it
[1:50:34] because I'm
[1:50:37] blind can you tell me that I can do it
[1:50:39] because I have a
[1:50:43] sight and then you must tell me
[1:50:46] why why will make the
[1:50:49] difference this quote reflects his
[1:50:52] determination and the challenges he
[1:50:55] overcame emphasizing their Disability
[1:50:57] should not determine one ability to
[1:50:59] pursue and Achieve
[1:51:02] dreams are we
[1:51:05] together are you ready for
[1:51:07] preaching okay I fin with all my
[1:51:10] storytelling now amen I finish with all

[1:51:17] business this morning Hallelujah
[1:51:21] amen when you look over there in in in
[1:51:24] in Exodus
[1:51:27] 4:1 uh the Lord says this uh uh uh to
[1:51:32] Moses Exodus
[1:51:39] 4:1 let me take the few minutes that is
[1:51:41] before us here then and uh and DEP into
[1:51:45] this
[1:51:48] word
[1:51:52] verse 10 Moses said unto the Lord oh
[1:51:55] Lord I am not eloquent neither hether
[1:51:58] told nonsense thou Hast spoken unto thy
[1:52:01] servant but I am slow of speech and of a
[1:52:06] slow tongue and the Lord said unto him
[1:52:10] who have made man
[1:52:13] mouth all who maketh the dumb or the
[1:52:18] death or
[1:52:20] the seen or the blind have not I the
[1:52:26] Lord what does that speaks
[1:52:29] of what does that speaks of there's no
[1:52:32] child that is born with a with a
[1:52:34] disability that is that is that is by
[1:52:37] mistake
[1:52:40] right praise the
[1:52:43] Lord God is saying I allow it I have a
[1:52:47] purpose I have a purpose
[1:52:52] I have a purpose if if the person that I
[1:52:55] gave it to can just give it back to me I
[1:52:57] will use it for the reason why I allow
[1:53:05] it praise the
[1:53:07] Lord but what the devil do is that he
[1:53:10] use that very thing and create a complex
[1:53:13] in our life and then we are depressed by
[1:53:17] that right because because we want to be
[1:53:20] like others and not appreciating who we
[1:53:24] are praise the
[1:53:26] Lord what we have what is given to
[1:53:31] us as if to say we can make ourself any
[1:53:34] better than what we
[1:53:37] are who make the
[1:53:48] Blind and just like like I said Jesus
[1:53:50] said there in St John chapter
[1:53:53] 9 is neither this man neither his
[1:53:56] parents don't blame his grandparents he
[1:54:00] was born
[1:54:01] blind for this very
[1:54:04] moment that God will be glorified
[1:54:10] yes praise the
[1:54:12] Lord see how much that God is looking
[1:54:16] for our
[1:54:18] inability to bring his
[1:54:21] strength amen perfect strength and
[1:54:24] perfect weakness brother Brandon says
[1:54:26] and that is the thing that we should
[1:54:27] know that's the thing that we should
[1:54:33] learn to be able to give to God our
[1:54:37] inabilities
[1:54:41] yes when we says I am weak but thou are
[1:54:45] strong it's not it's not just a music we
[1:54:49] must be be able to identify those areas
[1:54:51] where we are weak Lord I need you in
[1:54:54] this area not using it for an
[1:54:58] excuse but everybody not talk about
[1:55:01] yourself forget about
[1:55:03] everybody forget about everybody talk
[1:55:05] about
[1:55:08] yourself identify your need identify
[1:55:11] your your weaknesses identify the area
[1:55:13] where God can step
[1:55:17] in praise the Lord who make the
[1:55:21] blind who make the
[1:55:29] deaf Are we
[1:55:32] together are you beginning to see the
[1:55:36] picture amen this mystery blindness
[1:55:40] happen in
[1:55:46] part no matter how how how sharp your
[1:55:50] eyesight is it's
[1:55:54] limited amen no matter how sharp your
[1:55:58] eyesight Is 2020 what what whatever the
[1:56:01] the perfect number is is still
[1:56:05] Limited at a set end it will not be able
[1:56:08] to see and when it cannot see to from
[1:56:13] the limit Beyond you are
[1:56:15] blind
[1:56:17] yes you are blind to whatever is
[1:56:19] happening there
[1:56:24] right are we
[1:56:31] together that's what that's why the
[1:56:33] Apostle Paul called it a
[1:56:36] mystery that's why he called it a
[1:56:38] mystery why because he has been able to
[1:56:41] identify a Divine
[1:56:44] Purpose a Divine
[1:56:48] Purpose
[1:56:50] when Israel was promised a
[1:56:53] king through the linage of
[1:56:57] David for the Everlasting Ru of David
[1:57:00] why would they miss their their their
[1:57:02] their Messiah why why would they miss
[1:57:04] their King but there is a Divine
[1:57:11] Purpose because there are all there are
[1:57:13] other seeds of God there are other
[1:57:15] people that God has in his economy that
[1:57:19] he must bring them
[1:57:21] through praise the
[1:57:24] Lord so blindness happen in
[1:57:28] part blindness happen in part think
[1:57:33] about things that happen in our
[1:57:35] life that later on you come to realize
[1:57:38] you think about it you know uh uh I mean
[1:57:42] uh uh uh uh for people that were in
[1:57:44] Catholic church and in other
[1:57:46] denomination Church you grow up and then
[1:57:48] now you come to the message say she said
[1:57:49] oh
[1:57:51] wow why I never knew this blindness
[1:57:54] happen
[1:57:57] part praise the Lord God have a purpose
[1:58:01] why he allow you in in in
[1:58:04] that and not only denomination other
[1:58:07] things that we go through in our life
[1:58:10] and then you come to the reality that W
[1:58:13] yeah I I wish I knew
[1:58:16] better why God allow it
[1:58:23] why God allow
[1:58:28] it praise the Lord he has a
[1:58:31] purpose he has a Divine
[1:58:35] Purpose that is the thing that is behind
[1:58:38] a mystery the thing that is that that
[1:58:40] that is about a mystery is not just
[1:58:42] about a
[1:58:43] knowledge it's it's it's the Divine
[1:58:45] Purpose of God that is hid behind that
[1:58:48] scene
[1:58:53] why would Jacob cross his
[1:58:55] hands Joseph said standing he tou why
[1:58:59] why would he cross his
[1:59:03] hands praise the Lord because he knew
[1:59:06] his his father is blind he tried to make
[1:59:09] it easy for him he brought one son on
[1:59:11] this side one boy on this side identify
[1:59:15] them right but yes he crossed his hands
[1:59:20] why will he do it there is a Divine
[1:59:22] Purpose that was behind
[1:59:25] it praise the
[1:59:28] Lord that the cross will bring us
[1:59:31] in are we
[1:59:33] together
[1:59:35] Hallelujah now so brother Brandon will
[1:59:37] say this uh uh uh if we if we go back to
[1:59:41] our
[1:59:42] slide yeah I know I'm carrying these
[1:59:45] young people back and forth but that's
[1:59:48] okay
[1:59:50] they become smarter that
[1:59:53] way praise the
[1:59:57] Lord let's get back to our
[2:00:01] slide now brother Brandon would say this
[2:00:04] in God has a provided lamb he said you
[2:00:06] know blindness is a horrible thing and
[2:00:09] that's the way that is from the way that
[2:00:12] we will see it from from the heo
[2:00:14] perspective when I see the man blind my
[2:00:18] heart goes out to him but yet I know of
[2:00:24] a blindness that's
[2:00:26] worse praise the Lord
[2:00:31] amen and all of a blindness that's wor
[2:00:34] spiritual
[2:00:35] blindness how God made
[2:00:39] man to visualize him and they can do
[2:00:45] it God breaks himself
[2:00:49] in his
[2:00:51] creation for us to be able to see
[2:00:54] him praise the
[2:00:56] Lord but man has reduced him to creas
[2:01:00] and Dogma that you have to go to a
[2:01:03] certain church to meet God you have to
[2:01:05] believe a certain thing to meet God when
[2:01:08] God Paul says the invisible thing
[2:01:11] declare when God have he has spread
[2:01:15] himself in even in the leaves around us
[2:01:21] he has made himself so visible that we
[2:01:24] can be able to to to see him we don't
[2:01:27] need to get to a church to talk to him
[2:01:29] you can talk to him at the back of your
[2:01:31] we walk down the street and talk to
[2:01:34] him but man has reduced it down you got
[2:01:37] to get down there and do father son Holy
[2:01:39] Ghost you got to go through a certain
[2:01:41] Creed and Dogma to be able to get to
[2:01:43] this go that is so easily to be
[2:01:48] rich
[2:01:53] God says I make the death I make the
[2:01:56] blind but when God does it he does it in
[2:02:00] part but when man does it he give you a
[2:02:04] blindness in
[2:02:07] hold he make your mind blind your soul
[2:02:10] blind your heart
[2:02:12] blind that even your eyes is blind you
[2:02:15] can see read the scripture and you will
[2:02:17] never even be able to see when man makes
[2:02:20] you blind you have a blindness in hold
[2:02:24] when you get blind by creas and blind by
[2:02:26] culture and blind by just your
[2:02:29] superstitial belief you darken your
[2:02:32] heart
[2:02:33] right that even if they show you the
[2:02:36] word of God black and white you will
[2:02:38] still read across it you are reading it
[2:02:41] through your Creeds and Dogma why
[2:02:43] because it have darkened your
[2:02:47] heart when God gave blindness he gave it
[2:02:50] in part praise the Lord I had a time one
[2:02:54] time to be with one one one
[2:02:57] uh blind guide you know very nice guy
[2:03:02] here uh we used to fellowship with him
[2:03:04] in all of that and we we have this small
[2:03:08] I don't know how you call it alligator
[2:03:09] pepper very very small and and and and
[2:03:12] and there's a bu that used to fly uh uh
[2:03:15] during the reny season and uh uh you
[2:03:18] know uh people will capture it by the
[2:03:20] light you know and and and fix it you
[2:03:22] know well so I had this friend of mine
[2:03:27] he says look I I'll tell you let's you
[2:03:30] will see how how much this guy is
[2:03:33] blessed I'm going to put all of these
[2:03:35] short alligator pepper and mix it in
[2:03:38] this box because it's a box that we used
[2:03:40] to eat and mix it in this box they got
[2:03:44] and he will pick all the box and leave
[2:03:47] the alligator peer and give it back to
[2:03:51] you praise the Lord I had a privilege to
[2:03:54] work with uh with uh s language I did a
[2:03:58] little bit of sign language I wish I did
[2:04:00] a whole lot of
[2:04:02] it and then I had this this friend I
[2:04:05] would go to their
[2:04:06] school and I mean uh it it will always
[2:04:10] amaze me because as I as I would talk to
[2:04:12] the lady just before I finish saying
[2:04:15] what I want to say she has written my
[2:04:17] answer she just look at my legs
[2:04:20] she can
[2:04:22] hear but this little graduat from the
[2:04:24] University of of
[2:04:27] Liberia she just look at my
[2:04:33] lips when God give a person what would
[2:04:36] seem like a disability to men it's a
[2:04:41] gift it's a gift Society bring us and
[2:04:45] abuse us that we don't see those things
[2:04:48] as gift
[2:04:56] I had a bunch of list of uh of of people
[2:04:59] that that that that are physically imper
[2:05:03] I just choose that I was not going to go
[2:05:04] down that list or else we will not get
[2:05:06] up from here but I I I want to bring
[2:05:09] this for us to be able to see it that
[2:05:12] whatever condition that God put us in
[2:05:14] whatever part of the word that he make
[2:05:17] us that we were born it was not a
[2:05:20] curse praise the Lord because he put his
[2:05:23] seed all over the
[2:05:27] Earth there are people that are serving
[2:05:30] this very same God preaching this very
[2:05:32] same message that we are preaching they
[2:05:34] are in the jungle somewhere they don't
[2:05:36] have this access of building and drums
[2:05:38] and and and and guitar and and and piano
[2:05:41] but they come together with the Jo of
[2:05:43] the Lord in their heart they sing they
[2:05:45] praise God they feel the presence of God
[2:05:48] yes
[2:05:52] sir why because they have accepted what
[2:05:56] God has given to

[2:11:22] very dark
[2:11:24] place you are coming from a dark
[2:11:36] place let's read it in the message
[2:11:40] Rapture this I have that in the quote uh
[2:11:43] in my scripture there we'll drop back to
[2:11:44] death brother brand will says this here
[2:11:46] Revelation 3 there you are back to the
[2:11:50] black the the blindness again trumping
[2:11:53] over the things of God as if they didn't
[2:11:56] mean nothing to them scoffing and making
[2:11:59] fun of it that's what the Bible says
[2:12:03] he's identifying Lisha Church
[2:12:06] age an age that claim to be rich F of
[2:12:11] goods the Bible says she's miserable
[2:12:14] she's blind she's naked she's tramping
[2:12:17] over over the grace of God making fun of
[2:12:21] the things of God Church have just
[2:12:23] become an
[2:12:24] association right praise the
[2:12:28] lord we are not doing nothing for God in
[2:12:31] the body we are not doing nothing for
[2:12:32] God out of the body
[2:12:37] right it's just an
[2:12:40] association no sense of
[2:12:45] responsibility denomination Catholic
[2:12:47] Church Church gave us a a a a a system
[2:12:50] that tells you that the church is
[2:12:52] responsible for you so most of the
[2:12:55] people I have an aunt AED you know uh uh
[2:12:59] uh my my dad only living sister there I
[2:13:01] love her to death every time she call me
[2:13:03] you know and she ask me please help me I
[2:13:06] need to pay my deal to my church you
[2:13:08] know because uh all she's thinking about
[2:13:11] is for the church to bury
[2:13:15] her that's what denomination has given
[2:13:18] to us that the church is responsible for
[2:13:19] you it's a lie you are responsible for
[2:13:22] this body if you are part of this body
[2:13:24] you are responsible for it you are
[2:13:26] responsible for his growth for it
[2:13:33] spirituality when Church become just an
[2:13:39] association so when I die I can get
[2:13:42] somebody to bury me brother Braham says
[2:13:44] I'm thinking about how to come out of
[2:13:46] the Grave it's not to go in there
[2:13:56] but what is the spirit of the
[2:13:58] age it have created such such such a
[2:14:02] blindness for the
[2:14:03] people such a blindness brother Braham
[2:14:07] says until they are tramping over the
[2:14:09] things of
[2:14:12] God it don't mean nothing to them they
[2:14:15] can scarf and make fun
[2:14:18] of
[2:14:20] services let a person Come and sing
[2:14:23] special they they make fun but they can
[2:14:25] never sing
[2:14:26] speci yeah but they know all the songs
[2:14:29] in in the back of their
[2:14:34] head why it's from a dark place you are
[2:14:38] not seeing
[2:14:40] spiritually why because brother brandham
[2:14:42] said in the four seals you can go and
[2:14:44] you you can go and check it up he says
[2:14:47] the B body of Jesus when he ascended in
[2:14:50] heaven is sit in heaven as a
[2:14:53] memorial the only body that Jesus have
[2:14:57] is this one on
[2:14:59] earth praise the Lord you see the
[2:15:02] Catholic Church make us to look to that
[2:15:05] one it's just a
[2:15:06] memorial it's just a memorial that and
[2:15:09] that's the reason why he said Paul what
[2:15:11] are you persecuting me Paul says who are
[2:15:15] th Lord he says I'm Jesus he was
[2:15:18] persecuting the church he was laughing
[2:15:21] scoffing at the church praise the Lord
[2:15:24] and when he did that what happened to
[2:15:26] him he got
[2:15:28] blind God struck him blind and that's
[2:15:31] what happened when people are making
[2:15:34] mockery of the church mockery of the
[2:15:36] message of the hour you are just falling
[2:15:38] in a spiritual blindness that's
[2:15:40] all praise the Lord and then pretty soon
[2:15:43] in you gets so dark it gets so dark that
[2:15:47] no nobody can make you happy nobody can
[2:15:49] ever preach for it to make sense to you
[2:15:52] because you know everything inside you
[2:15:54] get so
[2:15:55] dark right spiritual
[2:15:58] Darkness yes sir if God blind you is
[2:16:01] just imp part don't worry he will open
[2:16:04] your eyes if he put you in a situation
[2:16:07] it's just imp part don't worry he will
[2:16:09] change your
[2:16:11] situation yes sir but when you allow
[2:16:14] yourself you allow your Creed you allow

[2:16:36] what you are just coming from a dark
[2:16:39] place yes sir you are just coming from a
[2:16:42] dark
[2:16:46] place
[2:16:51] Paul
[2:16:53] says 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse4 if
[2:16:57] our gospel be hate it is hate to them
[2:17:00] that the God of this evil age has blind
[2:17:05] it praise the
[2:17:07] Lord yes sir we don't have a room to
[2:17:10] carry you to initiation to believe this
[2:17:12] message right if God don't open your
[2:17:16] eyes is because something has blinded
[2:17:19] you your church system has blinded you
[2:17:23] that's right he say if our gospel be ha
[2:17:26] is ha to them that the God of this evil
[2:17:29] age has
[2:17:34] blinded are we together Ephesians

[2:17:41] thinging I hope you see where I'm coming
[2:17:44] from try to try to make this a tribute
[2:17:47] but but it it it became

[2:17:59] that that's the last quote I have to
[2:18:02] read Ephesians chapter 4:8 let's see
[2:18:05] what the Apostle Paul says here while we
[2:18:08] try to close this
[2:18:16] thing
[2:18:21] verse 17 he says this I said therefore
[2:18:24] and testified Ephesians 4:17 in the Lord
[2:18:28] that ye hence for walk not as other
[2:18:31] Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
[2:18:34] mind having their understanding
[2:18:39] darking being alienated from the life of
[2:18:42] God through the
[2:18:44] ignorance that is in them because of the
[2:18:49] blindness of your heart you see what
[2:18:53] what what the blindness of the heart
[2:18:55] does that's the reason why fenny Crosby
[2:18:58] could be happy to be blind in her eyes

[2:19:04] of the
[2:19:05] heart it make your understanding

[2:21:52] it's only the things that serve God's
[2:21:55] purpose has a
[2:22:04] resurrection so anything in our life or

[2:23:43] Thursday they called it the worst sight
[2:23:45] day you know because now to use the word

[2:24:17] life that was just blindness in
[2:24:23] part says oh why why didn't I know this
[2:24:26] now that you know it do something about

[2:24:36] it that's exactly what Jacob was talking
[2:24:39] about what different it would have
[2:24:41] made what different it will have
[2:24:45] made
[2:24:53] are we
[2:24:56] together the mystery blindness happen in
[2:24:59] part Paul goes down and he talks about
[2:25:03] the Redemption the Redemption of
[2:25:06] Israel which of course I will bring
[2:25:08] another piece to you that I saw there in

[2:25:21] with me this morning but that's what I
[2:25:23] want us to say what that's what I want
[2:25:25] if God allowed us uh if he allow illness
[2:25:28] in our
[2:25:30] life he want to prove himself as a
[2:25:33] Healer praise the
[2:25:36] Lord so if we have to go through a
[2:25:39] medical treatment or whatever we look to
[2:25:41] him for our healing it does not Rob God
[2:25:45] of healing he's the only healer that
[2:25:46] that we
[2:25:49] have are we
[2:25:56] together if anything come up
[2:25:59] mysterious for a Believer there is a
[2:26:02] Divine Purpose behind
[2:26:06] it there's a Divine Purpose behind it
[2:26:10] and for you to find the word of God is
[2:26:13] to be able to understand that Divine
[2:26:15] Purpose why did the Lord allowed
[2:26:18] this praise the Lord sir take the matter
[2:26:22] into your hand you take yourself into a
[2:26:24] Darkness yes you will get bitter you get

[2:27:44] mind I believe there was something
[2:27:46] something that she was needing from the
[2:27:56] Lord I was trying to get the
[2:27:59] song but she wrote a song after she got
[2:28:03] safe the beautiful thing about it that

[2:28:08] writing songs and she was singing at
[2:28:11] Crusade and she was never
[2:28:15] safe
[2:28:19] [Music]
[2:28:25] I think it was after one
[2:28:29] Revival when she wrote the ssong must
[2:28:31] Jesus bear the cross
[2:28:33] alone and all the word Go
[2:28:36] free no there is a cross for everyone

[2:32:36] all not
[2:32:41] pass what a musician softly play
[2:32:45] now
[2:32:47] let's bow our heart
[2:32:52] together I believe each and every one of
[2:32:55] us here right now right this very
[2:32:59] moment there's a place in our life that
[2:33:03] we can see we can see
[2:33:05] [Music]
[2:33:08] why it does not mean that there is no
[2:33:11] answer to
[2:33:14] that but but for now we cannot
[2:33:18] understand
[2:33:19] why why am I in this condition why is
[2:33:22] this happening to me why is this around
[2:33:24] my life we we can understand
[2:33:27] it we are blind to to it we are blind to
[2:33:31] the to to the solution we are
[2:33:34] blind in part there's a blindness in
[2:33:38] part but every blindness in part is for
[2:33:41] a purpose every blindness in part there
[2:33:44] is a mystery there is something that God
[2:33:47] is working on there is something he he
[2:33:50] he has brought us to this place he has
[2:33:52] brought us to this
[2:33:55] place Jacob that's the reason why he
[2:33:58] reminded
[2:34:00] Joseph he told his son Joseph there was
[2:34:03] a time I came to that
[2:34:05] place when I met the angel of the Lord
[2:34:09] he could not understand why all of these
[2:34:11] things happening to
[2:34:14] him he he needed to meet the angel for
[2:34:18] the mystery to be
[2:34:23] unfold brother brandham came to that
[2:34:25] place he could not understand it until
[2:34:28] an angel came down and said I'm from the
[2:34:31] presence of almighty God to tell you
[2:34:33] about your mysterious
[2:34:37] life it was a blindness that was imp
[2:34:41] part because behind that blindness he
[2:34:44] was the messenger of of this age behind
[2:34:48] that blindness he was the prophet
[2:34:50] messenger that will open the seals and
[2:34:53] and the the prophet messenger that would
[2:34:55] that will bring forth the message of the
[2:34:57] seal Christ open the
[2:34:59] [Music]
[2:35:02] seals and that is the same with you and
[2:35:15] myself
[2:35:18] behind our
[2:35:20] why whenever we ask the question why why
[2:35:28] mean it's just a blindness in part if
[2:35:32] you are a son of God and you are a
[2:35:34] daughter of
[2:35:37] God if you are a son of God and the
[2:35:40] daughter of
[2:35:42] God and you are looking to God to be a
[2:35:46] be able to open the msture to be able to
[2:35:48] bring you out of it to be able to make
[2:35:50] it more clearer to
[2:35:52] you but when you are walking in your own
[2:35:55] path and you are making your own
[2:35:57] decision you are making your own
[2:35:59] conclusion contrary to the word of God
[2:36:02] stumbling over the word of God the
[2:36:04] promises of God trying to find
[2:36:08] solution I'm telling you you are coming
[2:36:10] from a dark
[2:36:12] place until you get so angry with God
[2:36:15] you get so bitter with God you are
[2:36:18] coming from a dark
[2:36:23] place the God of this evil word has
[2:36:27] blinded you in your
[2:36:37] situation Isaac was
[2:36:39] blind and he called for Jacob and Esau
[2:36:44] to
[2:36:44] come and Jacob disguised
[2:36:49] himself and he came he says the body
[2:36:53] look like Esau but the voice sound to me
[2:36:56] like
[2:37:00] Jacob when I touch the B it looks like
[2:37:03] eer but when I hear the voice it sounds
[2:37:06] like
[2:37:09] Jacob but yet he gives the
[2:37:12] blessing he give the blessing
[2:37:19] why he did
[2:37:21] it why he couldn't investigate
[2:37:24] more why he couldn't
[2:37:27] wait because he was under a Divine
[2:37:31] instruction God was writing his
[2:37:34] word God was fulfilling his
[2:37:37] [Music]
[2:37:43] promise when we are blind we don't
[2:37:46] understand everything we don't know
[2:37:50] everything we have to give it to the
[2:37:52] Lord don't run ahead of the
[2:37:57] vision give it to the Lord Lord I don't
[2:38:00] understand but I know that you are in
[2:38:03] control I know you are in control I know
[2:38:06] you have a purpose for this I know you
[2:38:10] have a purpose and I'm going to
[2:38:12] wait I will wait until my change comes
[2:38:16] that's what job said when he could not
[2:38:18] understand his own situation he could
[2:38:20] not understand why he was going through
[2:38:22] why he was going
[2:38:24] through he was blind to to
[2:38:29] everything but he said I know my
[2:38:31] redeemer
[2:38:33] living I know my change will
[2:38:37] come because this blindness is just in
