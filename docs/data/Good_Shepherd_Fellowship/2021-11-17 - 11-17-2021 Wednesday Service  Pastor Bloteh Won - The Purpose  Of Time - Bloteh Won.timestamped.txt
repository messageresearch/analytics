[45:56] divine watchmaker

[46:12] really didn't get into
[46:15] a lot of details of what i wanted to
[46:17] deal with but i would take a little
[46:18] portion of it tonight praise the lord so
[46:21] let's uh
[46:22] let's take hebrew chapter one
[46:24] for
[46:29] for our scripture reading tonight
[46:31] hebrew chapter 1
[46:34] verse 1
[46:36] god

[47:42] baptist
[47:44] his ministry law was described in the
[47:46] book of isaiah comfort he comforted ye
[47:49] my people
[47:50] you had a way to comfort israel yeah of
[47:53] all the uh yeah the years of as desired
[47:58] and the years of being away
[48:00] and and you brought a messenger with a
[48:02] message

[48:05] even though lord father they thought he
[48:07] was a hatch preacher
[48:09] and lord they called him a woman hater
[48:11] but father lord his message was to bring

[49:01] the lord bless you you may have your
[49:02] seed
[49:04] amen
[49:07] so like i said uh uh
[49:11] on sunday we were talking about the
[49:13] divine watchmaker uh
[49:17] so i use that subject like i said i took
[49:20] it actually from
[49:22] from the book from a material that i was
[49:24] listening to
[49:25] and
[49:27] i just drew the thought from there
[49:29] and and
[49:30] uh
[49:33] to be able to bring out something
[49:35] and uh
[49:37] to talk about
[49:39] the purpose of time
[49:42] you know the purpose of time
[49:44] uh we read from ecclesiastes now on
[49:47] sunday
[49:49] where
[49:50] solomon says to everything
[49:53] honor the heaven
[49:54] this time
[49:56] praise the lord so
[49:58] god had a purpose of time and we
[50:01] realized that because he he's the great
[50:03] intent of god
[50:05] without beginning without end
[50:08] he's a great internal spirit
[50:11] but he have a purpose for time he had a
[50:14] purpose of why
[50:16] he created this loop called time
[50:20] in the message perfection brother
[50:22] branham says god just put a little loop
[50:25] on eternity
[50:27] where it sinks out and create this loop
[50:30] cup time and one of these day it will go
[50:32] right back into internet and there will
[50:35] be no time
[50:36] but the thing about it there is that
[50:39] there there is a purpose
[50:43] praise the lord and that's what i want
[50:44] to i want to i want to look into
[50:47] tonight because actually that was the uh
[50:51] the the inspiration that we had
[50:54] for uh for for sunday
[50:57] but i can tell you that i mean there was
[51:00] just there were just uh a lot of things
[51:03] going on i believe uh uh
[51:07] we got
[51:08] so busy
[51:10] you know with uh just dealing with the
[51:12] different things that we had to deal
[51:13] with but we want to thank the lord for
[51:15] giving us strength amen
[51:17] now so tonight that's that's where i
[51:20] want to go to and that's the reason why
[51:22] i took this scripture tonight yeah where
[51:26] paul
[51:27] is uh
[51:28] is is is is describing you know our lord
[51:33] jesus as the express image
[51:37] of
[51:38] his person
[51:40] praise the lord
[51:42] amen
[51:43] he is he he's identifying jesus
[51:48] uh
[51:49] being the brightness of god's glory
[51:53] and the expressed image
[51:56] of his person over in the book of
[51:59] collusion he calls him uh the image of
[52:02] the invisible god
[52:05] praise the lord
[52:06] so with this
[52:08] we want to take the taught to
[52:11] to to be able to just encourage
[52:13] ourselves tonight and say the reason why
[52:17] god created this loop called time
[52:21] is for expression
[52:26] it's for expression
[52:29] that's that's the only reason why
[52:32] god created this loop
[52:36] praise the lord
[52:37] is for expression and is to express
[52:41] himself
[52:42] it's not for us to make our plans
[52:48] it's for god to express himself
[52:54] the great attributes that were in him he
[52:57] created all things and created this loop
[53:02] called time so he can express himself
[53:06] it's all about him and him alone
[53:10] that's the reason why he will share his
[53:12] glory with no man
[53:15] as we were praying just now the thought
[53:17] struck me that's what i was writing down
[53:20] and uh
[53:22] because my mind was dwelling on the
[53:24] thought and i i thought i had to jot it
[53:27] down quickly before you slip away
[53:30] praise the lord
[53:31] amen
[53:32] thank you lord
[53:34] so that's that's what we we want to
[53:35] realize
[53:37] as sons and daughters of god uh we are
[53:40] now saying that uh
[53:42] we shouldn't make our plans you know we
[53:44] shouldn't think about the future but you
[53:46] must remember
[53:49] that
[53:50] whatever you are planning
[53:53] bring it back to the world
[53:55] let it be an expression of god
[53:59] because you have to remember brother
[54:01] brandon make the statement it says it's
[54:03] only the things that save god's purpose
[54:07] will rise again
[54:09] and what is that purpose to express him
[54:15] it's only the things that we express god
[54:19] in time
[54:22] that has a promise
[54:24] of eternity
[54:28] are we together
[54:32] i finish preaching tonight
[54:35] that's it
[54:37] amen i finished preaching tonight
[54:41] that's that's the thought
[54:43] so all we're going to do we're just
[54:45] going to dwell on that thought
[54:47] that is the thought
[54:49] that's the inspiration
[54:53] that's what the holy spirit wants you to
[54:56] realize
[54:59] yes sir
[55:00] praise the lord
[55:02] that if god brings a child is born only
[55:06] for a day
[55:09] and then we grieve if god takes that
[55:12] child life away we grieve we become a
[55:15] hurt and and
[55:17] but god has expressed himself
[55:20] as a giver of life
[55:25] he gives he takes away
[55:29] praise the lord
[55:31] amen
[55:32] if god has a man to stay 50 years on the
[55:36] earth
[55:40] praise the lord amen
[55:43] whatever time that god i lost to a man
[55:47] three schools and ten
[55:50] glory be to god
[55:56] whether it is that or before death or
[55:58] after that
[56:00] god's purpose
[56:02] in our life
[56:04] in all of our trials in all of our
[56:06] difficulties our sicknesses
[56:10] our uh
[56:11] and everything that we go through that
[56:13] you think you are going through and you
[56:15] think you are the only one going through
[56:18] it
[56:20] the reason why god have you in that
[56:22] situation is not because of you is
[56:25] because of himself
[56:28] he wants to express himself in your
[56:30] situation as a healer
[56:32] he wants to express himself in your
[56:35] situation as a deliverer he wants to
[56:38] express himself as a one that can change
[56:41] your life change your desires
[56:47] it's all about him expressing himself
[56:51] hallelujah that's what time was created
[56:54] for
[56:57] thank you lord
[56:59] praise the lord
[57:00] amen that's why he gave us time
[57:07] so he can bring us to the knowledge
[57:09] of realizing his purpose and then we can
[57:13] yield ourselves to him
[57:18] and say lord
[57:19] express yourself
[57:22] praise the lord
[57:24] that was the mystery in job's trial
[57:27] that was the place that god was trying
[57:30] to bring job
[57:32] when he says where was thou
[57:35] when the sons of god shouted for joy
[57:39] he wanted to bring job to that place of
[57:41] understanding he asked job do you know
[57:44] the treasure of the snow
[57:49] you know what i have had in snow
[57:53] because even in snow god expressed
[57:56] himself
[57:57] in cold winter god expressed himself
[58:02] everything was made for his expression
[58:07] that's why the prophet of god says if
[58:09] god is in you you will see god even in
[58:12] these flowers that are here tonight
[58:16] you will see god in everything
[58:19] that he
[58:20] made hallelujah
[58:23] yes sir
[58:26] yes
[58:27] praise the lord
[58:29] oh my
[58:31] that is the reason why
[58:34] god almighty god
[58:38] the creator of time
[58:42] is the best one and the only one that
[58:45] keep time
[58:47] that's why he's never late
[58:52] he's never late
[58:54] he always keeps his appointment yes he
[58:56] does hallelujah yes he does praise the
[59:00] lord because he is the keeper of time
[59:03] take take for example lazarus situation
[59:06] that's right
[59:08] look at that praise the lord
[59:11] he says i'm i'm not going because
[59:14] lazarus is sleeping the disciples say
[59:16] well if he's sleeping he's taking some
[59:17] rest he's not being well he's doing well
[59:21] jesus says well no i speak about you
[59:23] know his his death
[59:26] praise the lord
[59:34] and he never went the first day never
[59:35] went the second day
[59:37] waited until
[59:38] lazarus had died
[59:41] buried
[59:45] cross
[59:47] corruption
[59:51] praise the lord
[59:54] but yet
[59:55] he was on time
[59:58] think about it think about it
[1:00:00] think about it and bring it to your life
[1:00:03] situation when you think that
[1:00:05] oh i'm i'm late oh i'm you know i i you
[1:00:09] know uh uh uh uh elite for this to
[1:00:12] happen to me late for me to get married
[1:00:14] late for me to have a child you bring it
[1:00:16] to your situation
[1:00:19] you are looking at your time but you are
[1:00:22] not the time keeper
[1:00:24] the time keeper is almighty god
[1:00:32] amen god is the time keeper
[1:00:37] praise the lord
[1:00:40] that's the reason why father abraham
[1:00:43] count himself
[1:00:46] not old
[1:00:48] he kept trusting god because he believed
[1:00:50] that the god that has promised
[1:00:52] is able to keep his word
[1:00:56] so god was on time for everybody around
[1:00:59] abraham abraham was all but for god this
[1:01:02] was the time
[1:01:04] it was all about god expressing
[1:01:08] himself
[1:01:09] because at the end of faith he gets all
[1:01:12] the glory
[1:01:13] praise the lord amen
[1:01:16] he gets all the glory you can make
[1:01:18] yourself proud and you can make yourself
[1:01:20] feel good because you think that i've
[1:01:22] achieved this oh you know i spent five
[1:01:24] years in school i spent uh uh four years
[1:01:27] studying this to get this degree and and
[1:01:30] and and all of that if god is not
[1:01:32] expressed in that
[1:01:35] it would just take a while you will
[1:01:36] realize that you have all your degree
[1:01:39] and yet instead you are nothing
[1:01:41] right
[1:01:44] praise the lord amen
[1:01:46] and amen that does not even have close
[1:01:49] to your degree but because he have
[1:01:51] yelled himself for god to express in him
[1:01:55] you are envying him
[1:01:57] that's right well i have the great and i
[1:02:00] i'm not being able to achieve this this
[1:02:01] guy never even gone to school and he get
[1:02:04] out of these things is because
[1:02:07] he just
[1:02:08] he fall on the mean spring
[1:02:10] [Laughter]
[1:02:14] oh praise the lord
[1:02:16] i just love the lord
[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:20] he's the time keeper
[1:02:23] he is the time keeper
[1:02:25] and he he's never late
[1:02:28] always on time
[1:02:30] god is always on time
[1:02:35] if we would just understand it
[1:02:39] the bible says we are made for his
[1:02:41] pleasure what what pleasure for him to
[1:02:44] express himself
[1:02:46] through the things that we go through
[1:02:51] you mean that god has pleasure in your
[1:02:53] pains yep
[1:02:55] he has pleasure in your pains it's just
[1:02:58] an opportunity for him to release his
[1:03:00] attribute of being the healer
[1:03:04] to release some uh
[1:03:06] uh
[1:03:09] jehovah rapha to you
[1:03:13] oh praise the lord
[1:03:15] praise the lord
[1:03:22] he's the express image
[1:03:29] i'll take something brother branham said
[1:03:31] down here and uh we will see jesus he
[1:03:34] said
[1:03:36] now god was in christ
[1:03:38] reconciling the word to himself now we
[1:03:41] all believe that
[1:03:43] god was in christ he expressed
[1:03:47] what god was
[1:03:50] he was the express image of god
[1:03:56] god was in christ reconciling the word
[1:04:00] christ was the express image of god
[1:04:04] manifesting to the people
[1:04:07] what god was
[1:04:09] they saw in christ his son
[1:04:13] he was the anointed one
[1:04:16] the word
[1:04:18] christ means the anointed one
[1:04:22] praise the lord amen amen
[1:04:25] so the great invisible god
[1:04:29] wanting to express himself and censor
[1:04:32] he's
[1:04:33] he's uh
[1:04:34] an internal spirit
[1:04:37] he had to create a form
[1:04:40] for us to be able to
[1:04:42] have an idea
[1:04:44] for us to be able to identify him
[1:04:48] praise the lord
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:57] so
[1:04:59] he created a form called the word
[1:05:03] delugos
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:09] there god gave birth to himself
[1:05:14] god condemns himself
[1:05:17] in whichever way we want to express it
[1:05:20] but god was creating a form
[1:05:23] to express himself
[1:05:30] amen
[1:05:32] the bible says he's
[1:05:35] the image of the invisible god this
[1:05:38] image is not like
[1:05:40] something that looks like
[1:05:43] no
[1:05:44] it's not something that looks like
[1:05:48] but is god taking a form
[1:05:53] so the image of the invisible god is not
[1:05:56] like you looking at your image
[1:06:00] but it's actually god taking a form to
[1:06:04] express himself
[1:06:10] are we together
[1:06:13] so that's that's that is all the reason
[1:06:15] why
[1:06:17] we had the first day the second day the
[1:06:19] third day the fourth day the fifth day
[1:06:22] the sixth day the seventh day
[1:06:25] all that the reason why it was just for
[1:06:28] god to inspire express himself in the
[1:06:30] sun express himself in everything that
[1:06:32] he made
[1:06:35] amen thank you lord
[1:06:38] bless you my lord
[1:06:40] praise the lord
[1:06:42] it's just all about him expressing
[1:06:44] himself
[1:06:47] you see that's the reason why
[1:06:50] christ having the preeminence in the
[1:06:52] church
[1:06:53] in the bride is necessary for a rapture
[1:06:57] is the winding up
[1:07:01] god having a people
[1:07:03] in this last day where he can express
[1:07:06] himself yes amen not a people that want
[1:07:09] to make the name of a church in a city
[1:07:13] no but the people that want to live for
[1:07:15] the name of jesus
[1:07:21] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:07:23] it's necessary and a 3-4 mystery was
[1:07:26] necessary for a rapture
[1:07:36] don't forget about it tonight
[1:07:40] i'm trying
[1:07:41] not to preach i don't want you to make
[1:07:43] me preach
[1:07:45] but um what i want you to
[1:07:48] realize yes and don't forget
[1:07:52] is that the purpose
[1:07:54] of time
[1:07:56] the purpose of the years that is given
[1:08:00] to you on earth
[1:08:03] is for god to express himself
[1:08:07] praise the lord
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:12] those are the only people
[1:08:15] that have
[1:08:18] the hope of a resurrection
[1:08:23] it's only the things that serve god's
[1:08:26] purpose will rise again
[1:08:30] and god's purpose for time
[1:08:33] is to express himself
[1:08:37] praise the lord amen
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:41] is to express himself in your life
[1:08:44] thank you lord
[1:08:46] thank you
[1:08:48] thank you
[1:08:49] that's the reason
[1:08:50] why we might ask the question what would
[1:08:54] jesus do
[1:08:56] in this situation
[1:08:58] lord what will you do
[1:09:02] or what will you have me do amen
[1:09:09] praise the lord
[1:09:10] oh sometimes we get overtaken and we are
[1:09:13] caught in ourselves and we want to prove
[1:09:14] to this god i'm not stupid
[1:09:17] or i'm not a fool
[1:09:21] praise the lord
[1:09:23] when you think about david
[1:09:27] he was a king
[1:09:28] he knew he was anointed
[1:09:32] by samia
[1:09:33] he knew that
[1:09:36] but yet at the time he was a figurative
[1:09:39] that's right
[1:09:40] a man his subject
[1:09:44] throwing dust at him in and saying this
[1:09:46] this man is a dog you did this to sword
[1:09:49] and all of that
[1:09:51] and one of david mann said
[1:09:54] i would not allow i just said but i'm
[1:09:56] talking that in spoken word is the
[1:09:58] original see justice even listening to
[1:10:00] that since i would not allow him
[1:10:04] to talk to mine
[1:10:06] my king like that cut his head off
[1:10:09] david said leave him
[1:10:12] why
[1:10:14] because he was expressing christ
[1:10:17] he was expressing the rejected king
[1:10:23] and when christ was rejected he never
[1:10:25] went throwing stones back peter took a
[1:10:27] sword and caught a man here he said no
[1:10:29] put it back
[1:10:36] he was expressing
[1:10:38] you see in in
[1:10:40] in those moments
[1:10:42] in the scripture
[1:10:44] the holy spirit sees the emotion
[1:10:48] of those patriots
[1:10:51] because the purpose
[1:10:54] was to express
[1:10:56] god amen was to express christ
[1:11:00] so you and myself today we can read the
[1:11:02] bible and see christ in david
[1:11:09] we can see christ in jeremiah we can see
[1:11:11] christ in isaiah
[1:11:21] why because when they look from the
[1:11:23] curtain of time they want to see christ
[1:11:25] in us yes
[1:11:27] they should be able to see christ in
[1:11:29] laodicea
[1:11:30] age
[1:11:31] christ in young men and women standing
[1:11:33] for righteousness standing for truth
[1:11:37] not just living for ourself
[1:11:42] you lay for yourself you die for
[1:11:44] yourself
[1:11:47] praise the lord
[1:11:50] the purpose
[1:11:51] of time
[1:11:53] the purpose of every giving
[1:11:57] time
[1:11:59] every click of the second
[1:12:04] the purpose
[1:12:06] that god makes your heart to still be
[1:12:08] beating in your chest
[1:12:16] is the opportunity
[1:12:18] for him to be able to express himself in
[1:12:20] you
[1:12:22] thank you lord
[1:12:24] thank you
[1:12:26] thank you
[1:12:30] that's the only reason why we have time
[1:12:34] time
[1:12:35] was created
[1:12:36] for expression
[1:12:41] praise the lord
[1:12:43] that's the reason why if time
[1:12:46] lingers on
[1:12:50] what really in you will be seen
[1:12:54] no matter what you profess
[1:12:57] if time linger on
[1:12:59] because time
[1:13:03] was created for expression
[1:13:07] like i said sunday
[1:13:09] the old saying that says time will tell
[1:13:12] that's right
[1:13:14] if time lingers on just like i said
[1:13:16] before if time lingers on we will read
[1:13:20] your post on facebook
[1:13:25] praise the lord
[1:13:28] if a person is just hiding on the the
[1:13:30] the image of the message and just and
[1:13:32] just trying to conform and trying to be
[1:13:35] a believer and dress like a believer
[1:13:37] without an experience
[1:13:40] if time lingers on we will read your own
[1:13:43] oppose
[1:13:45] praise the lord
[1:13:46] but when if a man is uh or a young woman
[1:13:50] is
[1:13:50] is is is born of the spirit of god no
[1:13:53] matter what you are struggling with in
[1:13:55] your mind
[1:13:56] if time lingers on you will overcome
[1:14:00] praise the lord
[1:14:01] with time if time legal on you will
[1:14:03] overcome you will bring that desire
[1:14:05] under control you will bring that
[1:14:07] thought under control why because the c
[1:14:10] word is in your heart
[1:14:13] that is struggling to express himself
[1:14:16] that word has captured your body and
[1:14:18] want to express himself and that word
[1:14:21] has the power to bring every desire
[1:14:26] onto subjection yes
[1:14:28] yes
[1:14:30] hallelujah
[1:14:32] yes
[1:14:36] that's the purpose of time
[1:14:40] let's just read a little bit yeah the
[1:14:42] spoken word is the original sea and then
[1:14:44] i will leave you for tonight
[1:14:49] praise the lord
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:55] spoken word is the original sea bird
[1:14:56] bear says so god made man
[1:14:59] in
[1:15:00] his own
[1:15:02] image
[1:15:03] after his kind
[1:15:05] now he used this expression over and
[1:15:08] over he emphasized on it he says god
[1:15:10] made man after his kind you know he
[1:15:13] believe he says after his kind his kind
[1:15:16] what is his kind the word
[1:15:20] amen
[1:15:22] the word
[1:15:28] praise the lord
[1:15:30] he is the word
[1:15:34] then if a man deny god's word how can he
[1:15:38] be
[1:15:40] in god's image
[1:15:43] that's the reason why this body is not
[1:15:45] the image of god
[1:15:48] this body is the image of a beast
[1:15:53] praise the lord
[1:15:54] that's the reason why it smells like the
[1:15:57] beast of the earth
[1:16:00] a desire like the beast of the earth he
[1:16:02] died like the beast of the earth
[1:16:12] and if a man denied god's word how can
[1:16:15] he be made in the image of god
[1:16:17] just ask the question ask yourself
[1:16:21] how can he be
[1:16:24] in god's image
[1:16:26] and deny god's word
[1:16:29] when the word
[1:16:31] express image
[1:16:34] of himself
[1:16:39] praise the lord
[1:16:42] are we together
[1:16:44] that's the express image god expressing
[1:16:47] himself
[1:16:50] through the word
[1:16:58] amen
[1:17:01] so if a man denies the word
[1:17:05] if a man is struggling with the word
[1:17:13] if you are a seed of god a son of god a
[1:17:16] daughter of god you are just struggling
[1:17:19] with
[1:17:22] your true identity
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:30] so much believe in the max one that you
[1:17:33] are struggling with your true identity
[1:17:37] the word is the expressed image of
[1:17:39] himself oh
[1:17:41] he says it doesn't means that
[1:17:44] express image of god saying oh
[1:17:50] i said but i didn't mean i really didn't
[1:17:53] mean it
[1:17:55] i was wrong there
[1:17:57] and then back up he says
[1:18:00] that that was the same other time
[1:18:04] i didn't mean it
[1:18:06] oh mercy
[1:18:07] trash
[1:18:08] he said slope of the devil
[1:18:11] that he fed to eve
[1:18:14] now so you think about it now think
[1:18:16] about it like brother branham same year
[1:18:19] you know a man
[1:18:22] in the image of god denying god's word
[1:18:26] now think about eve
[1:18:30] was she created in the image of god yes
[1:18:34] yes god created man
[1:18:37] male and female
[1:18:39] and she came right out of adam that's
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:43] that's right
[1:18:45] praise the lord amen
[1:18:48] but there was a there was a time where
[1:18:51] she struggled with her
[1:18:52] her identity
[1:18:57] there was a time where she she denied
[1:18:59] her identity
[1:19:01] when god made her in
[1:19:03] his image
[1:19:06] an expression of him
[1:19:10] a female expression of him
[1:19:14] she had the same
[1:19:16] right and same authority that adam had
[1:19:18] called equal
[1:19:20] but there was a time
[1:19:26] where the enemy says well god knows that
[1:19:28] the day you eat of that fruit you will
[1:19:30] be like him she was already an
[1:19:32] expression of god
[1:19:42] but he came and robbed her of that truth
[1:19:44] expression and she wanted something
[1:19:50] something different from what god
[1:19:52] has already given to her
[1:20:02] praise the lord amen
[1:20:07] you see that's the reason why you have
[1:20:09] to stay with the world you have to make
[1:20:10] sure that is the word
[1:20:14] not because it sounds right
[1:20:16] you know i said this thing one time you
[1:20:18] know uh uh not because it sounds right
[1:20:22] it can sound right and you can say amen
[1:20:24] to it
[1:20:26] and it's not right i was looking for an
[1:20:28] instance and i found one
[1:20:32] this this is uh this has been a saying
[1:20:35] that has that has gone around the
[1:20:37] message
[1:20:39] you know and this is uh you know uh your
[1:20:41] parent
[1:20:42] is the holy ghost until you get the holy
[1:20:45] ghost
[1:20:47] it sounds right
[1:20:49] your parent is the holy ghost
[1:20:52] until you get the holy ghost
[1:20:55] that sounds right it sounds to be a lot
[1:20:58] a logic thing
[1:21:00] but no parent is the holy ghost
[1:21:04] no parent is the holy ghost
[1:21:08] god don't make me your holy ghost
[1:21:13] your pastor is now your holy ghost until
[1:21:15] you get the holy ghost
[1:21:21] i'm supposed to be a shepherd i'm
[1:21:22] supposed to guide you a parent supposed
[1:21:25] to be a guiding
[1:21:27] but not your holy ghost
[1:21:35] praise the lord
[1:21:38] and because of that statement many
[1:21:40] parents have played god in their
[1:21:42] children life
[1:21:44] and say well i'm your holy ghost until
[1:21:46] you get the get the holy ghost there is
[1:21:48] no code of that in the message
[1:21:52] yes sir
[1:21:55] i have searched for it i've never found
[1:21:57] brother branham saying it there is no
[1:21:59] quote like that in the message
[1:22:02] but it sounds right
[1:22:05] because the parents supposed to be
[1:22:07] guidance
[1:22:13] yeah let's take guidance there let us
[1:22:15] not be holy ghosts
[1:22:16] because we are not holy ghosts
[1:22:23] that's only one
[1:22:27] amen
[1:22:35] praise the lord
[1:22:36] so you see that brother brandon i'm
[1:22:38] giving an example here how
[1:22:40] how the devil fed eve
[1:22:46] and it make her to even question
[1:22:49] her true identity
[1:22:54] praise the lord
[1:22:56] and by that she fell
[1:23:05] but yet it's
[1:23:06] it allowed god to express himself as a
[1:23:09] redeemer
[1:23:11] because he had a lime slate in his mind
[1:23:14] [Laughter]
[1:23:16] that's why that one the devil didn't
[1:23:18] know about it
[1:23:19] they never didn't know that god
[1:23:22] he's a shepherd boy he knows how to skin
[1:23:24] lime and dress his children he didn't
[1:23:27] know
[1:23:28] god caught him by surprise
[1:23:30] well almighty god came with her with her
[1:23:32] with a lime skin he says where did he
[1:23:35] got that one from
[1:23:36] it was in the back part of his mind
[1:23:40] god just allowed that because he wanted
[1:23:43] to express himself that he can dress you
[1:23:46] better
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:48] than your faction
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:51] he can dress you better he can dress you
[1:23:53] decent then hollywood can dress you
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:03] that's all time was created for
[1:24:06] for god to express himself thank you
[1:24:09] lord thank you aren't you glad that
[1:24:11] that god can express himself through you
[1:24:14] praise the lord
[1:24:16] amen
[1:24:18] when we come to church and clap our
[1:24:21] hands
[1:24:22] i mean when you get the understanding of
[1:24:24] this you will come to church and just be
[1:24:27] like a wallflower
[1:24:31] you will not just sit down
[1:24:34] you look for every any opportunity if
[1:24:37] you can use anything lord use me
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:46] that's the desire the holy ghost will
[1:24:48] create in you if you can use anything
[1:24:51] lord
[1:24:52] use me
[1:24:55] even if i have to be a sweeper
[1:24:59] praise the lord
[1:25:01] i know every young man want to be a
[1:25:02] preacher
[1:25:04] amen
[1:25:06] but you have to be called
[1:25:09] god have to have taught about you to
[1:25:11] express himself through you as a
[1:25:12] preacher
[1:25:16] we all want to be preacher nobody want
[1:25:18] to break the yah nobody want to
[1:25:22] clean the
[1:25:24] church i wish i could give you that and
[1:25:27] do the other ones
[1:25:29] i love to do it
[1:25:31] praise the lord
[1:25:33] even as a preacher i still do it
[1:25:39] oh man
[1:25:41] so you grab the thought tonight
[1:25:44] you grab the thought tonight
[1:25:47] the purpose of time
[1:25:50] is for god
[1:25:52] to express himself
[1:25:55] if god gave you how many years you have
[1:25:57] given you on this earth
[1:25:59] the purpose
[1:26:01] is for him to express himself
[1:26:05] and if we miss that
[1:26:07] we miss the purpose
[1:26:09] and if you miss the purpose there is no
[1:26:11] resurrection
[1:26:14] praise the lord
[1:26:19] no wonder the law can give a vision of
[1:26:21] brother's cat coming out from from the
[1:26:24] tomb
[1:26:25] i said young boxer saying i have won
[1:26:30] he gave his life
[1:26:32] 40 years

[1:27:52] that the purpose of time
[1:27:54] is for god
[1:27:56] to express himself
[1:27:58] and if god is a god that is on time you
[1:28:02] have to realize that god cannot express
[1:28:04] himself in your lateness if you are
[1:28:06] always late
[1:28:08] making excuses
