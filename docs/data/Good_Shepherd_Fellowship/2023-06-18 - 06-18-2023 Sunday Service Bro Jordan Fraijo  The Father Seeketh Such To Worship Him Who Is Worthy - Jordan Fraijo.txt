greeting before he comes up so we just have a few things here we want to read and share with you just before our brother comes up and now now thank you also for all of your prayers and text messages you sent us this morning we are very grateful praise the Lord and uh uh who acts that you continue to pray for us just being uh needing some rest in my body so I just ask that you continue to keep us in the prayer but Brandon shared this and I uh in the Ephesian Church age and I taught to really this morning but what brought it to my mind uh is the other we had a we had a good turnout on Wednesday night that's gone Wednesday and I talked the other uh that was a that was a good thing for the church and that's you know that's a good that's a good sign of healing and now so brought a brand and shared this he says how beautiful the Savior praises and command his children he takes full account of how fine spiritual attitude and behavior of the uh sorry of the fine spiritual attitude and behavior he knows that there is weakness among them but as yet he does not cry out against it is in there just like the Lord he knows how to encourage us in the right matters and discourage us in the wrong matters we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families praise the Lord and we better still we could all learn a good lesson in their God Deeds with each one of us in exactly this way don't ever be discouraged Sins Of God for God is not ungracious to forget your labor of love whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water to someone has a reward and blessing from the Lord amen so I thought to command you for that and just like we said I mean this is our church and it only takes us to make it a better church amen takes us to make it a better Church it takes us to make it a New Testament Church it takes us to make it an overcoming Church praise the Lord so we will keep believing that God will bring full healing and strength to the body and a few things I would like to also comment on on Father's Day this is from Time Magazine uh one of time I was in article I was looking at reading some statistics and I just picked these few out of it for Father's Day maybe another time in the Lord bless us who we will bring whatever message we we had on our heart to preach and it says here we need fathers to step up to realize that their job does not end at conception what makes you a man is net the ability to have a child but the courage to race one praise the Lord amen the courage to raise one and so the courage that you take to impact the young people to teach their music teach them skills to run the the audio back there that's all it takes for you to be for one to be uh father amen is is creating leaders for tomorrow creating fathers for tomorrow praise the Lord another uh article here also this is from time achieve where are all the fathers the message the message that gets is that they are not up to the job okay the message they asked get is there they are not up to the job and a record number done is sticks around to raise their kids even as father even as fathers I needed more than ever now this is a uh a little testimony here or a happening uh I don't have a dad she's making it a tiny blonde child with a Pepsi nose and who gets up at a visitor and talk of her hunger well I do have it there but I don't know his name I only know his first name Bill just what it is that father do love you they kiss you they hug you when you need them I had my boyfriend for a while but they broke up now Megan leave with just her mom and older brother in Carver City California what would you like to do with your dad I did want him to I I didn't want him to talk to me she's hurting them I wish I had somebody to talk to me it's not fair if two people made you then you should stay be with those two people and she's and and she's sad I'm not so special she said looking down at the floor I don't have two people she imagined what it will be like for him to come home from work at night it will be just like that commercial where the kids said Daddy uh are you all right she's my dreaming the kids show the daddy there they care for him the port thermometer in his mouth they think he's sick because he came home early they are sitting on the couch watching TV and it's like wow we can play with that Megan thanks her father is in the Navy now one day when he gets when I get older I'm going I'm going to go back to Alabama and try to find him more children will go to sleep tonight in a fatherless home than ever in the nation's history talk to the experts in crime drugs abuse depression School failure and they can point to some some studies somewhere blaming those problems on The Disappearance of father from the American family but talk to the fathers who do stay with their family and the story grows more complicated what they are hearing from the buses from institutions from the culture around them even from their own wives very often come down to a devastating message we don't really trust men to be parents and we don't really need them to be and so every day every word their children are growing up without them the modern day father comes in very forms today father is no longer always the the traditional Maori Breadwinner and this disciplinarian in the family he he can be single or married extremely employed or stay at home and adoptive us our step parents and the more them capable caregiver to Children facing physical or psychological challenges and physiological research across family from all ethnic backgrounds suggests their father father's affection and increasing family involvement help promote children social and emotional development this in the message have an ascending he says now sometimes I preach pretty rough because I see that somebody getting out of line you see you are supposed to do there a real daddy will why he did shake you and say yeah get back here in line if he's a real daddy a true father so sometimes your pastor has to will then on something just love him that much more because he's a real father to you see trying to keep you line up because he's watching over your soul which the Holy Ghost has made him the overseer of the church and you must always watch that praise the Lord so in this humble way we say Happy Father's Day and we pray that God will help us to be better fathers better husbands to our wives better Sons to our mothers and or more overall better some Son of son and daughter of God in the age that we are living praise the Lord and so it won't take much of your time I mean we can go into talking here that is that's an easy thing for us to do but we want for us to just stand on our feet I have a father he knows my name let's sing there what brother Jordan comes [Music] thank you [Music] I have a father [Music] he called me his own he'll never leave me no matter where I go he knows my name [Music] he knows my everybody [Music] dog it is [Music] I have a maker [Music] foreign [Music] he knows who I am [Music] a father oh Lord Make It Personal to you this morning it's not just a song you really believe you have a father foreign [Music] [Music] oh my God [Music] you know that's such a beautiful thing this morning to be able to say I have a father doesn't matter who you are in this room or who you are in the world if you know him doesn't matter who your Earthly father was doesn't matter if he loved you doesn't matter if he cared for you doesn't matter if he was around for you if you know him if you know almighty God you can truly say I have a father [Music] I have a father who knows my name [Music] I have a father who cares about me personally I have a father who knew my every thought he knew my every deed who knew everything I would do before I did it and yet he loved me and yet he loves me today yet he cares for me he cares about where I'm going he cares about where I've been he cares about what I'll do [Music] and he wants the best for me not in this life just this life but in the life to come too you know I know brother one already gave us a little thought on Father's day but to give credit where credit is due I gotta say I'm thankful for the father God gave me you know he wasn't perfect and he still isn't because he's a man [Music] but the things he taught me [Music] he taught me how to stand up he stopped me no matter how tough the going gets keep on going he taught me if you make a mistake make it right he taught me there isn't anything you can do [Music] that can forgive you of that [Music] so I say this morning I'm thankful for the father my father in Heaven gave me and to every father [Music] I said God bless you and you continue striving every day to be the father God has called you to be it's not an easy thing he's called you to be a real father but he has called you to be that because he no he knew he made you more than able to achieve that whatever place and Stage you're at in this life in this stage of fatherhood God has something more for you yet it's not over if you look and you say well I haven't done so good yet or I didn't do so well time's not over you're still here God can still do something for you I say to you sons and daughters if you have a father [Music] maybe he wasn't a Christian maybe he isn't a Christian to this day but if he ever taught you anything I say be thankful for him let him know today Dad thank you for teaching me the things that you did and being the best father you knew to be you know many times as children and even young adults before you reach stages of responsibility in life we look at things in our past of those who are whether our parents fathers people we looked up to teachers people that God put over us and we look at things that happen and we go wow why'd they do that or I would have never done that I'll never do that to my kids and you don't realize is that we're looking back many times with with you know 20 20 vision Maybe your situation you've been Gods allow you to have influences in your life where now you have a better understanding of life you have a better understanding of the Gospel and that's good because that'll help you be a better father that'll help you be a better mother but look back and see and I bet if you look back and see you'll see that your parents your father with what they knew with how they were raised and what they were taught did the very best they knew and they wish they could have done better as time goes on but they did the best they knew how and we need to recognize that and say thank you and for the things that they could have done better that's okay forgive them move on because that's what God calls us to do don't hold it against them that's not they didn't mean it thankful for the father that they are father that they were [Music] and go back and restore that fellowship with the father your father because that is the whole thing you see [Music] Noah's always working in a way in the people today in that little thing that Brother Juan read is talking about the lack of fathers in the home and you see that in the homes and amongst people you realize when the devil is doing that in the natural it's because he's also wanting to do it in the spiritual he's wanting to separate your fellowship with the father because he knows he can break your fellowship with the father it all falls apart so I say this morning both with your natural and spiritual father go back reconnect restore fellowship with the father if you have a good relationship it can be better grow that into a friendship that it gets never been before and God will bless you God will bless it interesting that one more time I have a father well this thing the one Morris and then the verse the one verse in the chorus and we'll write to the message [Music] he calls me his own oh he'll never leave me no matter where I go [Music] He Knows My Name he knows my everything easy [Music] pray Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful to be back here in your house and in your presence here this morning Father gather together with your people father Lord we're so thankful for the opportunity Lord that you would call us and bless us to with this great opportunity to be here with you father Lord to hear your word and have you speak to our hearts father Lord he asked you just come down and have your way take control of the service Lord I Surrender myself to you that you would be able to use me to speak to your people father sent me to decide if any thoughts and things that maybe I thought to bring father were incorrect or you just stop me Father Lord if there's something you want to say that's not even in my notes then Lord you just take me just that way and speak to the heart of the people we pray Lord Jesus ask you bless your people this morning and Jesus most wonderful and precious name we pray amen amen thank you musicians if you would turn with me we're just going to turn to John chapter four we're going to read verse 20 through 24. if you're here with us Wednesday or you're able to catch the service on Wednesday we're going to follow up from where we're at and touch on that in John chapter 4 verse 20. our fathers Worship in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for this father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth you may be seated this morning I just want to take a title possibly from this from verse 23 the father seeketh such to worship Him and maybe as a subtext of who is Worthy no on Wednesday night we took a dive into worship and we found out that worship is not what most of us perhaps would would think it is is that today we have a very perhaps narrow understanding of the word and most of the time even myself if you know I gave the example on Wednesday I said if I said let's all cook together for a time of worship or for a worship service I would assume that that service would mostly be a time of singing someone might read a scripture someone might say a few things we might pray a little bit but it would probably be a lot of singing probably a lot of just songs of of about God's love a real sweet sincere songs that would draw us into his presence but that's not worship no don't get me wrong that could be a part of worship but we found out that worship has more to do with obedience and submitting yourself to God in the original form of the word and just real quick we're going to jump over and I see they have it here we're going to read through the definition of the word worship this is straight from the dictionary and sometimes it's good for us to go in and just get a dictionary definition because we've got this idea of what something means and then when we start to dig into it we realize that's not it at all right it's not that's not even the basic understanding of someone reading the dictionary that's how far off we are and worship means to honor or show reverence for a Divine being or Supernatural power to regard with great or extravagant respect honor or devotion reverence offered a Divine being or Supernatural power you know out of all these the one closest to the worship service we would think of would perhaps maybe be the third is reverence offered a Divine being or Supernatural power but the first two are greater breakdown of how that reverence is offered and I put together here just a quick what I thought would be a synopsis or tied together what we Define you know um thought from Wednesday was before we jumped in to what I'm looking to the direction I'm looking to go in this morning and what we developed is that worship is revealed in the true worshiper through their reaction to the moving of the holy spirit in their life a true worshiper submits themselves to God's will in their life whether it's instruction correction admonishment or praise the worshiper reacts to the will of the father as a blessing worth more than gold in the shaping of their character shaping them into the image of the father you see because true worship is an act of submission whenever in olden times they said they would come before Kings and potentates come before people of authority and Power it and then says that they worshiped they would give worship to that individual they would frustrate themselves on the ground in many instances they weren't allowed to look the individual in the eye because to do that was to call yourself equal with that individual and so in coming before they would prostrate on the ground upon their knees or if they flat out in submission worship letting them know that I am fully surrendered to your will thoughts power whatever it is that you want of me I give you full control and with that being established of what is worship then in the scripture here it says the father seeketh such to worship him and that is tied into where Jesus said the father the hour cometh now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him now this lets us know that God isn't waiting he's doing something active he's actively looking just like Jesus with the woman at the well it doesn't say that the woman met Jesus he the woman didn't go to Nazareth the woman didn't meet him at the temple the woman wasn't in Jerusalem and met him there the woman didn't go to where Jesus was in fact if you remember the story I don't know how many of you are familiar with the story or how well you're familiar with the story but it says that as they were traveling Jesus said I have need to go by way of Samaria you know the disciples thought he was crazy because not only was Samaria out of the way but that would be like going from Bloomington to uh um let's say what what's further if I'm trying to think of somewhere a little bit further west of Bloomington there but you're going in that direction West from Bloomington and I was you're traveling with me and I said you know what we need to go to downtown Minneapolis on our way there laughs you know you'd all be like that's not really on the way and it's definitely we're not we're going instead of going from one good part of town to the next good part of town like I'm not sure what your plan is here but that is definitely not on the way but that's what Jesus did and not only that it touches on here when Jesus is talking to the woman he's sitting there at the well where he says you know us the Samaritans we have no dealings with the Jews and it wasn't just like oh well we don't do business together this was strife to the max this was racial contention as bitter as you have ever seen it wasn't just we don't do business we have no dealings we don't talk to you we don't look at you unless we're spitting at you and Jesus said I have need to go by way of Samaria in order to go back where we're going the father seeketh such to worship Him so the father's seeking and you know with my subtext something to keep in mind here who is Worthy I only wrote who is worthy because when I tried to thinking how I would write that out for what I wanted I realized that my subtext was going to be longer than my title and that that just don't work out well but throughout time and maybe not everybody but I can say for myself throughout my Christian Journey there's been many a times who is Worthy Has Come On My Mind and in two different ways one in regards to myself and one in regards to God because throughout my journey I've had many a Time as a Young Man different stages in life where I can look at my life and I go I'm not even Worthy like the Roman soldier who came to him said I'm not worthy that you would come to my home but if you would speak the word it'll be so I can remember many a time as a young man in my own struggles and shame and depression thinking I'm not worthy to go to church I'm not worthy to be amongst the people of God I'm not worthy of the Gospel I don't even deserve to sit in the building under such condemnation I'm not worthy and then there's been other stages and times in life where I'm ashamed to admit where things have happened in life that you can't explain there's no good reason there's no way to explain oh I can see how God is working through this you might see it 5 10 15 20 30 years later but in the moment you say Lord why why am I going through this why do I have to suffer this way what is your purpose of this I thought I was your son I thought I was your daughter I thought you love me and you'll sit in the church you'll sit wherever you're at and the thought will come I don't want to worship with what I'm having to go through what God's putting me through I don't feel like he's worthy I know that's rough that that no one wants to admit they ever even thought that because how can you be a Christian and have a thought like that don't worry I'm gonna walk you through a few here and I'm going a little slow here and I realize that but I want to set the tone for where we're going and then once we do that I say buckle up because we're going to run really fast hold on if you want my notes afterwards we either get them to you or they'll be available somehow ask me all give me your phone number or email I'll give them to you so you have the references so you ought to just stick with me so that we can get out of here on time but I'm going to take and walk us through and see in both of these situations we are not alone I'm going to walk you through a few Heroes of Faith who all had the same situations have all faced the same things and one thing I will tell you is that the devil will do anything to stop you from worshiping from being a worshiper and submitting to God either by convincing you you're not even worthy to submit yourself or by convincing you that God's not worthy to submit to he doesn't care which one it is healer lets you know that you're so low in the dirt that you're not worthy of this gospel and you're not even worthy to worship or he'll convince you that the gospel is not worthy to be worshiped and he doesn't care which way you go or what time in life it is and he'll flip you one way or the other it's just like that as long as he can keep you to either side that's his goal you see Satan or by his original name Lucifer was that made the chief worshiper in heaven that was his function he led the worship in heaven and when he went his own way he no longer desired to worship but to be worshiped he lost that position and when he lost that position he lost the power that came with it and he wants to keep you from your position as a worshiper because he knows the power that comes with the position of the worshiper because he once stood there and if he knows you stand in that position with that power there's nothing he can do against you so let's I'm gonna jump in and we actually took Abraham on Wednesday and we just touched briefly on it and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna I have quite a few scriptures and a couple of quotes and you know it's very hard it's very hard for me to do is pull a single section of a quote and just read that because I always feel like it's missing the context and same thing with the scripture I I want about two lines out of a verse but I feel like if I don't provide you with the the ten verses before that that it won't have the same effect so what we're going to do is we're going to read quickly and then I'll stop and pause on the parts with that that we're really wanting to put some offenses on in Genesis 22 1-18 we found out Wednesday night here that Abraham is the first person in Scripture to be identified with worship the father of faith Genesis 22 verse 1 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou love us and get thee into a land of Moriah and offer him up there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and settled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you now I want to focus here real quick is that Abraham at this stage in his life had already been through so many things with the Lord that submitting and trusting God was so easy and I say if you don't know that then what I want you to do is when you go home take the Book of Genesis and start reading through the life of Abraham all the way up to this moment you can see oh this is you see if we just read here you're like wow Abraham was able to trust he was able to worship easily he was able to submit himself to God no questions you know why because Abraham had many failings prior to this in submitting to God's word and God's will and going off and doing his own thing thinking he had a better idea and God having to come back and correct him and bring him back to where he needed to be and he'd come along all this way and he'd seen the promises of God come to pass one after another and now at this point this is Abraham's hardest trial but his greatest moment of faith is because everything God had offered him the reason for leaving the land of his father the reason for separating for from lot the reason for setting himself aside away from everyone else and trusting God no matter what believing God that him a man of 75 years old would still have a child for 25 years when he knew in 25 years my wife is going to be 75. when God gave the promise way back then Abraham and Sarah didn't look like young men and women they look like they were of that age Abraham looks 75. a man who had not just 75 into days years but 75 of the hard years of living in Wilderness tents and deserts the guy looked like a piece-old boot leather have you ever seen someone who's lived in desert harsh climates their whole life there wasn't a whole lot of advertising for skin care back then it was limited there was no reprieve from the heat every day this he looked like he had weathered 75 years and so did his wife and he in the sake of looking insane to everyone else he went out proclaiming I am going to have a son and some people said yeah that's possible you got a new wife Coming someone really young no no Sarah oh these 75 years of heat have gotten to you Abraham but you see the reason why he was able to worship and submit to God's word here at this stage because 25 years later not only did the the promise come to pass but he had the manifestation of it right in front of him and he said if God from these dead bodies can produce a son then even if I give him to God in death God will give him back to me again because God has already made another promise is that by Isaac my seed shall come so one way or the other Isaac's got to be around later because he ain't got no kids yet so he just goes and he says I am the lad will go Yonder and worship what he's saying isn't that him and Isaac will go pray him and his Isaac will go sing he said I and Isaac are going to go up this mountain and submit ourselves to God prostrate ourselves to his will and come again to you Abraham at this point had no doubt he said I and the lad will go and we will come again to you he says I don't know how that's going to happen he said I am really confused on the details because I have never seen someone dead come alive again laughs but he says I have no doubt somehow that's going to happen and Abraham took the word of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering Isaac does not have the same relationship with the Lord yet if you read in Genesis you'll find out later that he makes some he has to have he has to go through some of the same things in life later develop a relationship with the Lord he just didn't get one because Abraham had one and neither do any of us behold the fire in the wood but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering flew in both of them together and they came to the place where God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in the Altar and bound Isaac his son and lay them on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him and Out of Heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God sing thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself I have sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and asked not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and a sand which is upon the seashore thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy and in thy Siege shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice now Abraham by faith he worshiped not because he said well if I submit to God there's a blessing in it so the greater my submission the greater my blessing you see God doesn't run His blessings off of your submission to his word like an investment where you have a promised percentage return so that anyone just deciding to can put in and and take out as they please no God does bless his people but you see it's like the what Jesus said he said put ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you the way most people apply that today is Lord if you add all these young to me I'll put you first and that's not what we say many times with our words but that's what our actions tell him and see this is Abraham and his stage of faith where he'd got to that place where he understood that scripture you say well that wasn't said wait until thousands of years God's word never changes his Concepts never change and Abraham had learned if I put God first I don't even have to worry about tomorrow God got it in control and many times you know if we were to choose what our reward would be for any given action you know you'd really really undersell yourself you'd probably pick something really menial because of our finite understanding we would pick something very finite but God that's why God doesn't let you do that see if he had said Abraham what do you want to reward for this Abraham might have put some real thought into it and then pick something really small but he Abraham was not thinking of the reward when he went he just was thinking Lord if this is your will this is what I'm going to do and when that happened God said because you did that because you submitted to my will I'm going to bless you in ways unimaginable not only not only you but your Generations after you to this day that blessing is still upon the Jews this one act of submission to God's word is still blessing the generations of Abraham you know that's if you listen to anything online or social media everyone to these days is talking about generational wealth how to build generational wealth how to set up your kids and their kids and their kids kids and the kids kids it's not new God had that plan from the very beginning Abraham built generational wealth in God for his family for forever never ending no everyone thinks they thought they thought up something new and great God had it first and he chose to bless Abraham with that you see and Abraham for us would be the example of where we all would like to get is that when God reaches out to us and says I want you to do this moves on your heart to do a certain thing either say yes Lord how far you want me to go how high do you want me to jump not quite well I don't know I have to see if I'm busy that day I had some things I was doing with friends um I don't know if I can get the day off of work I don't know how what people other people will think about that I need to get some opinions no if God is moving on your heart he wants you like Abraham to say yes Lord and just go go because you're not thinking well okay if I don't do that how will that affect me and if I do do it what's the benefits no um worship submit yourself unto the Lord don't worry about it that's what he told the disciples he said when you go don't take a second cloak don't take a second staff don't take anything extra he said if you really believe what you're doing for me is true and you're really in the service of the Lord when you get there I'll provide what you need you know and that's not to say God doesn't want you to be a good Steward of your time of your thoughts of the people you hang around with of the job that you have or the money that he's given you that's not that's not it because he does because those are all things that he's doing in your life too you know I think many times we we tend to get we catch on to one thing and we forget that there's the rest of the scripture too and that we need to walk down the middle of the road in a balanced gospel so so here it is Abraham his Generations are blessed forever because of one act of submission of worship now there's another individual and we're going to jump in and be right at the beginning it seems very much like Abraham like he doesn't question God but we'll find out that he has his own issues that he goes through as we head on in through scripture in job chapter 1 verse 13-20 and there was a day when the sons when his sons and his daughters job Sons and Daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and there came a messenger unto job and said The Oxen were plowing in the asses feeding beside them and the sabians fell upon them and took them away yea they have stayed in the servants with the edge of the sword and only I am escaped alone to tell thee well he was yet speaking there came also another and said the fire of God has fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I only am escaped alone to tell thee well he was yet speaking there came another also another and said the Chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell thee well he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine and their eldest brother's house and behold there came a great wind from the Wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and I only am escaped alone to tell thee then Joba Rose rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped job's first reaction to all of that job thought he had God's favor and he did he never lost God's favor because these things are not an indicator of his favor or displeasure job lost everything in the same day it wasn't over a year over 10 years slowly you know he was watching his portfolio in the stock market stock market slip he made some bad choices and Investments and he could see why it happened but if you look at these most of these actually look like acts of God what would any of us say if we heard that fire Came From Heaven and consumed something that belonged to you like I made God pretty mad like there are not too many instances of Fire coming from heaven and it not being God coming down to destroy people Sodom and Gomorrah I mean I can remember there's a few stories throughout the time when the Israelites were fighting their enemies when God would come down with Hailstone and brimstone and fight for them but there's fear a few instances that job would be like well you know I knew this other guy who really had faith in God God really loved him and he burned up his stuff too foreign in fact I don't know that there's another spot maybe in history that I just don't know of and his children it says a win from the Lord let me let me go back maybe I'm calling a great win from the Wilderness I'm not sorry it didn't say from the Lord but if a Great Wilderness went from the Wilderness right after fire what you thought was fire from God from Heaven consumed something else and then the next thing you know a wind from the Wilderness came and knocked down the house that all your children were living were in and killed all of them you'd probably say wow who controls the wind and the waves Lord what did I do that's like getting that's like being the model employee and getting told you need to go the your your supervisor needs to see you right now I mean it's much different because it's a lot less change in your life the worst thing that happened is you get fired for something you didn't know about you can always get another job you can't get dead kids back not typically so all job can see job didn't know the conversation God and Satan had he didn't know that God said there's none like job Joe we know that we know that reading the story job didn't know that job didn't have a clue one day he's doing well and the next day he is really not doing well then Jehovah Rose rent his mantle shaved his head and fell upon the ground and worshiped the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord he said I don't get it I don't understand it Lord if you would just tell me what I did wrong I would do anything to make it right he didn't have to do this I didn't even know I'm assuming I did something wrong but yeah I submit to your will nonetheless a worshiper now and and said naked came I out of my mother's womb this is him worshiping and naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord in all this job sinned not nor charge God foolishly job sinned not not for a moment after all that did job doubt God because we know there's only one sin and that's unbelief doubt so in all of this he said I still trust you I still believe you and I still submit to your will no over the next year or so where job still didn't know why all this happened to him and it just seemed to get worse and worse and everyone turned against him job had his times of doubt if we go to job 3 1-11 I think I feel like I've been in this place like job before I didn't have this much loss but after after and cursed his day he didn't curse God he said I cursed his day and job spake and said let the day perish wherein I was born and the night in which it was said there's a man child conceived let that day be Darkness let not God regard it from above neither let the light shine upon it let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell upon it let the Blackness of the day terrify it as for that night let Darkness seize upon it this guy's gotten some deep depression he didn't say well he'd been for any of us with not as eloquent who just said it'd been better if I hadn't been born but that wasn't enough for job as for that night let Darkness seize upon it let it not be joined unto the days of the year he said my existence is so miserable that the very existence of the day I came to be should be erased from memory forever let it not come into the Numbers number of the months low let that night be solitary let no joyful Voice come therein let them curse it that curse the day who are ready to raise up their Mourning let the stars of The Twilight thereof be dark let it look for light but have none neither let it see the dawning of the day because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb nor hid sorrow from mine eyes why died I not from the womb why did I not give up the ghosts when I came out the belly job is definitely here in this stage saying I'm not worthy of anything I don't know what I did but whatever I did I Am So Unworthy that I'd ever even deserve life this person job should never have existed job was in a very little place so you see the Devil comes to you in your time of need a year time of loss and tries to take and share this same thing with you and you get in your mind and say I should never even have existed why am I even here what is worth even living you're amongst friends you're amongst men of God who they've all had to fight the same battles now job didn't stay here we're gonna keep moving in job 19 he's getting close to the end of the misery and the loss and him just being beat upon his friends those who he thought he were his closest friends through this time have all showed up his wife said job why don't you just Curse God and die whatever you did it's bad enough for him to do this to you if you just do one more thing maybe he'll just eradicate you and take you from your misery yeah that's pretty rough from the one person you expect to be the your main support in life like God said she he gave her to you for a help meet and uh that's the kind of help you're being dealt it's not great he had his three best friends sit for a year and try and convince him job you're a secret sinner if you'll just confess your sin maybe we can get over this God wouldn't do this to someone who wasn't a sinner and here we come to the end of that he's been through his depression he's suffered through this and he says oh that my words were now written here's the true worshiper coming back out see even through this depression he was still a worshiper he was just going through a low point and here it comes back out he still hasn't been delivered he's still sitting on the ash Heap but he's caught a revelation of something he's slowly catching a revelation of his identity of who he is and despite the position he's in what his end will be oh that my words were now were written now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pin and led in the rock forever for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God who my shells see for myself and mine eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me job has come to that place where he says Lord I don't know why I'm going through this he says I know if I will just stick it out and endure whatever reason it is you're taking me through this I know my end result I know where I stand and where my place will be in eternity and because of that I can bear any of this he said I don't understand and this is the place as Believers and worshipers that will come to even when going through those great trials and situations where you have questions Saints It's Not Unusual you're you're human you're just flesh and Bone and in your flesh you're going to have those questions about why am I going through this why did my child have to die why did my father have to die why did my spouse have to die why did this one turn against me why do all my friends no longer want anything to do with me why did that Pastor who seemed to love me so much all sudden turn on me in a moment why do I feel so alone why am I going through this sickness why am I going through this diseased State didn't you promise me health and we have these things when we're going through it sometimes but as we go through it God will give us strength and we'll came to this same place as job and realize this is not our end estate this is simply a place we are passing through and we submit to God and say Lord though you slay me in this life yet will I trust you because I know of the place of which I came and where I'm going I'm not going to read the scripture I'm just going to relate the story to you the first one David and I'm walking us through because you know sometimes and I know I need to hurry sometimes when we're just stories from the Bible stories from a thousand years ago stories from 2000 years ago even though they're true stories we're like how do I relate to that Abraham wow that's 6 000 years ago almost things are different now but we can see God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever through the scripture no matter what working in the lives of his people building character raising them up to be Sons and Daughters of God ready to stand in his presence ready to take the throne with him and speak the word and his Direction and David here if we all know the story of David how he started out as a Shepherd boy and he was chosen of God by Samuel an anointed king as it's just a young boy because of the situation with Saul and then he gets called to the court he gives receives great victory in battle both over Goliath and many other the enemies of Israel and there is a time when there's a snap and Saul turns on him trying to kill him now all of us have a 20 20 Vision on this story we can look back and see it for everything it was we know that God had already rejected to Saul as being King and that's why Saul was going through these because he was anointed and Afflicted of an evil spirit David did not know that Instagram and Facebook were not big things back then the fact that him and Saul and Samuel had had words like we talked about Wednesday and go he said God has rejected you it didn't make it too much further than Saul and Samuel's conversation as far as the rest of the people knew Saul was still and was the anointed king of God over Israel very few people knew not even Saul that Samuel had snuck off and anointed some young boy King the only thing Saul knew is that evil spirit in him didn't like the spirit in David he wasn't trying to kill David he was trying to kill the spirit in David the anointing and here's David a young man he likes Saul Saul's his father-in-law he thought Saul like him too he was best friends with Jonathan bosom friends a stronger bond between them than amongst Brothers and all of a sudden randomly one day David thinks here I am I'm doing something good for Saul I'm playing my harp singing him a really nice song that I wrote for him about how great he is and what an amazing King and all that stuff and then out of the blue he throws a javelin at him and he just barely ducks and misses you know if he wasn't anointed to be king of God I don't think Saul would have missed the guy was a warrior he not only that he was the biggest and strongest of men in all of Israel he was Head and Shoulders taller than everybody the scripture says he was he was a veteran in combat he did not miss easy throws across the room at a still Target but it couldn't be and here David is now he's on the Run he's hiding to the point where he's gone over to the Philistines he's over there and there's a point where he goes out with his men and they're gone from all the women and children and they're all staying there in ziklag was the city that they were all camped out in he had 600 men and it was their wives and children including David's own and they had gone out and they came back when they came back here they are David's doing his best to serve the Lord in fact unbeknownst to the Philistines he would tell the Philistines that he was attacking Israel instead of attacking Israel him and his men would go attack outlying Villages that were were um direct allies of the Philistines to protect Israel sir he is he said even as a cast out from the kingdom by Saul he's still doing his best for Israel serving God in every way he can hear he comes back from battle and the women and the children are gone and the town is burned to the ground and everyone falls into anguish and sorrow the feeling was so strong that these men who had all left Israel to serve David because they believed he was the servant of the Lord that quick in a moment went from the servant of the Lord to deciding whether or not to Stone David on the spot as the one who the leader who had allowed this to happen and it says David strengthened himself in the Lord he worshiped he didn't blame anybody else he said well it's just as much your guys's fault somebody could have stayed here it's not just my fault that's something we found out Wednesday is that both Lucifer Satan Cain Saul went under that inspiration they all immediately when called out on their sin called out on their failures began to blame others none of it was their fault and it's not my fault and I think I did the right thing and it's still not my fault and then they find someone to blame it on Adam did the same thing when he felt and he was the son of God but under that wrong Fallen inspiration he said when God said have you eaten of the tree he said the wife you gave me he blamed his wife and he blamed God he didn't say Lord yes I from the tree forgive me and not only that I didn't protect my wife from eating from the tree either and it's my fault because that's what true husbands are called to do you know in this message they all the men all like to chant about headship and and who should be over the home and all that stuff and they like the part where they want to make decisions and tell people what to do but they forgot the part where God said husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it it doesn't mean oh I'd take a bullet for her it means actually giving up your will your ideas what things that you want for the things your wife wants now doesn't mean that you just in the things that you feel God is leading you in your home and maintaining a standard you just roll over but most things in life are not that but God says you are to stand up for her when things go wrong you say I as the house the head of this house take full responsibility for where this house is gone and what has gone wrong no matter who did it who said it and I will do what it needs to be done to make it right that is a true head of a household being able to admit it's on me because when we sinned and came short of the glory of God did never blame us the thing he immediately did was put a plan in motion to bring himself down into the body of Flesh and pay the price for us that is how Christ loved the church and I'm getting off subject yes David takes responsibility he worships God when doing that God then speaks to him and brings Deliverance but Deliverance came after worship David as well like Abraham like job submitted himself and said Lord I don't know why this is happening but thy will be done will you lead me I will follow and like Abraham the blessings God gave him and his Generations after when you take God at his word take responsibility submit and worship God always brings a blessing and deliverance without fail without fail you'll never find one without the other no that was David going through something that you'd say well he didn't deserve that it wasn't something he was doing wrong and that's why he came upon him but you know David did have something that happened to him where it was his fault and I want to read that in second Samuel 12 1-23 and the Lord and I want you to if you were here on Wednesday or you heard the service you know how Saul reacted when Samuel came to him and said Saul you've sinned his reaction was no I've done all the Lord asked me to do I've done nothing wrong this was the difference between Saul and David a man after God's Own Heart it wasn't the fact that they made mistakes but it was their reaction to the word the reaction to correction and the Lord said sent Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city one rich and the other poor and the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing save one little you lamb which he had bought and nourished up and when he grew up together with him and with his children did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring men that was come unto him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was to come to him and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die see God knows how to get our attention is he'll come to us he'll send a Nathan and ask our opinion on something and we'll have a strong reaction because we think it's somebody else and we are really good at judging other people fast like we don't have to think about it boom we got the right scripture the quote and the we are fired up ready if there's someone to burn at the stake we're ready to do it now and we're feel real righteous about it too and that's David there he is he's ready king of Israel he's going to go save this person give them True Justice for what they've been through and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing because he had no pity and Nathan said to David Thou Art the man thus saith the Lord God of Israel I anointed thee King over Israel and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul and I gave thee thy Master's house and thy Masters wives to thy bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel and of Judah if that had been too little I would have more ever given unto thee such and such things wherefore hast thou despise the Commandment of the Lord to do evilness sight thou Hast killed Uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and I slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou Hast despised me and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wise before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son for thou did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son and David said unto Nathan now Saul immediately when he was rebuked for going against the word of the Lord said no I haven't gone against the word of the Lord I have done exactly what God Said to do imagine how Brazen you have to be to stand in front of the prophet of God who gave you the word of the Lord who is telling you you didn't do the word of the Lord and to his face say no you're wrong I did do it I have done nothing wrong in fact I did something even better than what God wanted now here's the difference David said unto Nathan here's the heart of the worshiper submitting submission to the word he's worshiping I have sinned against the Lord no squabble no well I don't it's not exactly the way you heard it I don't know who who told you because it probably doesn't wasn't that way there's really blame 50 50. it wasn't just me there was two of us she when I sent people to go get her she didn't have to come to my house do I we all make all the excuses we have a million reasons why it's not even if it's a little bit our fault it's not all our fault when David didn't do that he just said when the full weight of what Nathan said hit him he said I have sinned against the Lord instant and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die wow because they were living under the Ten Commandments this is a murdering adulterer under God's law David deserved to die twice you would say what David did was actually probably in the eyes of us much worse than what Saul did [Music] but that infant submission to God's word brings Grace in your life unmerited favor how be it because by this deed that has given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die you see even though we're forgiven sometimes there's things in life that you're going to have to bear the consequences and the reaping of that thing you're forgiven but that thing's going to follow you maybe not forever but there's going to be something that will stick with you not eternally God's forgiven and forgot but because it's here on this Earth it's tied to you he's a forgiving God and he's forgiven you but there's some scars In the Flesh that just don't go away there's reputations once made the devil and everyone he reminds are still here and Nathan departed unto his house and the Lord struck the child that uriah's wife bear unto David and it was very sick now I want to touch this real quick and we say you know how cruel it is that the Lord would maybe that the Lord would kill a child you could look at it that way but we're going to read a little bit further we're going to find out the Lord didn't condemn the child he simply took the child home that child he said because of the situation here on Earth you can't stay where that child went straight to Glory and I know because of what David says in just a little bit because the Lord did not judge the child based on the actions of his parents and the blood of Jesus Christ the sacrifice made before the foundation of the world covers you simply being born in sin and shaped in iniquity that's what the price was paid for David therefore besought God for the child and David fasted and went in and lay all night upon the Earth you see a worshiper even when they've done wrong in their situation and the Lord spoken and said this is what's going to happen it's not Lord don't do it I don't deserve it it's just Lord just like Christ in the garden there he was facing the cross and he knew it he said Lord if you will let this cup pass from me that's okay you're allowed to pray that and it's up to God whether he decides to let that cup pass or not or whether or not you'll have to drink of it it's totally his will it's okay to ask that and David therefore besought God for the child and David facet went in and lay all night upon the earth and the Elders of his house arose and went to him and raised to raise him up from the Earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them they were pretty concerned but David but when oh wait and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the Servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then Vex himself if we tell him what the child when the child is dead they said wow if he is so distraught laying before the Lord endlessly and the child's alive what will he do when the child when he finds out the child is dead but when David saw see this is a worshiper fully submitted to the Lord that his servants whispered David perceived that the child was dead therefore David said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself changed his apparel and came into the house of the Lord and worshiped the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord a worshiper and he came to his own house and when he re and he when he required they set bread before him and he did eat then set his servants unto him what thing is this that thou has done thou did as fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead though this rise and eat bread and he said while the child was yet alive I fasted and wept for I said who can tell whether God will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he is dead wherefore should I fast he said it's done God's made his decision can I bring him back again I shall go to him but he shall not return to me David said I know where he's at and one day I will go to him but he's not going to return to me here on this Earth so here you see even when you've done wrong and the devil wants to come to you and let you know that you're unworthy to come before God to come into His presence he's not wrong you and I have never been Worthy for a moment to stand in his presence alone but we do not stand alone We Stand by the blood of Jesus Christ that took care of the sin issue that transgression that you thought the devil's trying to convince you of that makes you unworthy to worship unworthy to come into the house of God unworthy to come into His presence you don't realize that God's just waiting he's standing there he's waiting for you like David to say I have sinned before God amen Lord forgive me and he's just waiting standing there waiting for that for you to say that so he can come Sweeping in and say Grace Grace Grace Grace be unto you your sins which are many are made white as snow they're gone I don't even remember that quick I don't remember what it was that you think you did a worshiper now there's a whole bunch of slides here and I'm out of time but one of the stories that haunt my heart is we all know the song it is well right do we know the story behind it how why and when it was written just raise your hand all right a few for those of you who don't a man named Horatio spafford this was in the 1800s I believe he was very good friends he was a Christian man and it was a businessman there in Chicago he was very good friends with the evangelists D.L Moody in fact he helped finance a lot of his campaigns he helped finance a lot of ministry and if I would think of a person who would be a modern day job it would be this man he was a wealthy man and all within a year's time or so or a few years time they had the Chicago Fire he lost a lot of his Holdings and wealth and during that time because of the Chicago Fire they were going to be going over to Europe with D.L Moody to be a part of some of his Services there and he couldn't go because he was still dealing with some of the losses and insurance claims and business things and so he sent his wife and four daughters ahead of him by ship it wasn't a rickety old bucket of a ship it was one of the nicest ships they went first class when I say he had money he had money both his wife his daughters and the it says I've read the part of the story says there was four ministers that were all sent first class doesn't say that he sent them but I imagine he did imagine he paid their way you would think wow what a man of God that's taking what God has given him and just returning it back into the service of the Lord and on that voyage across the ocean in a fog that ship and another ship collided and the ship went down in moments and the only person of the family that survived was his wife all four daughters drowned when she got to Europe she sent him a message and part of that message said saved alone he went to Europe and there's different accounts of when the song was written I think the most famous one is that when he was over he was traveling over by ship and when he was over the general area of the the ship going down is that he went out on the bow of the ship and he wrote that poem it wasn't a Psalm at the time he wrote those verses to it as well with My Soul and another account says that actually the song was written much later that's a minister gives an account that it was actually written that he wrote it in his study when the minister was there visiting him but that that detail is not really important but we know this the store part about the drowning of his children but you know they had three more children all of them passed away also he has additional failings in his finances and time went on but the thing about his story that stands out is still with us today is that song it is well because Horatio spafford whatever else he was in life was a worshiper there's actually let me is this actually something his wife said a pastor notated his wife's name was Anna after Anna was rescued on the ship Pastor Nathaniel wise one of the ministers if you want to slide 49 if you have that the ministers traveling with the surviving group remembered hearing Anna say God gave me four daughters now they've been taken from me someday I will understand why on the next slide on 50 the very bottom there she remembers the wife says she remembered something a friend had once said it is easy to be grateful and good when you have so much but take care you are not a fair weather friend to God what a woman of faith but the song it is well after all these things happen to him this was the true worshipers cry from his heart when peace like a river attendeth my way when Sorrows like see Billows roll whatever my law has taught me to say it is well It Is Well with My Soul It Is Well with My Soul it is well It Is Well with My Soul though Satan should buff it through those trials should come let this Blessed Assurance control that Christ hath regarded my helpless estate and has shed his own blood for my soul he was a man who understood like job no matter what I go through though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh will I see God he said I don't know why I'm going through all these things on earth but I know where I'm going after my sin oh the Bliss oh here he is he can understand where David stood my settle the Bliss of this glorious thought my sin not in part but the whole is nailed to his cross and I bear it no more praise the Lord praise the Lord O my soul and I don't think I put the last verse in there and that's okay and that brings us to the last example of a man of Faith who went through things in life where God corrected him and put him through great trials and his result was to worship and that's the man that we all call a prophet oh God William Miriam Branham he was a man like me and you he went through all the same issues and troubles and trials but you know he also had to face that at its deepest point and make a decision to be a worshiper he had to make a choice whether or not he was going to submit no matter what happened to God's will in his life let me I was going to read an extended portion and if if you want to go back this I would suggest go back and listen to life story from 1959. and I you know I've listened to life story many times growing up in the message and I've heard a lot of messages and a lot of teachings but I tell you the older you get the more you pay attention life story hits so much different so much different let me I'm gonna go to us I'm going to jump over and it'll kind of contain it all in in the one just so that we can wrap up here two it's slide 66 hear ye him if you're guilty you've sinned and you've transfer trespassed against God's commandment you don't know what to do about it let me say this and I think it's gonna no I'm gonna hold off on I'm sorry you don't know what to do about it the Bible said hear ye him for he took all of our iniquity he took all of our trespasses away here you him what we need tonight is not so much law and not so much of these denominations and so many barriers what we need is the love of God what we need tonight is men and women who will take a bold stand from the depths of their heart and serve the Lord Jesus submit to being worshipers to worshiping the king the world's looking today not for a new denomination if I'd have started 10 years ago when I was in here I'd probably been the father over a great denomination sure it would have been when men came to my house and said brother Branham oh you got it in your hand do this no there was somebody spoke to me above and I heard him I don't want to start denominations we don't want to start denominations and that doesn't mean the church or or starting a giving it a name and calling this a Pentecostal or Presbyterian that's not a denominator that that's they've put a label on a denomination so you can identify it but brother Brandon let us know that one man one individual can be a denomination when you put your own thoughts your own Creeds your own dogmas the fruits of your own labors above what God is calling you to do you've denominated and God will have nothing to do with it after that that's what Cain did that's what Saul did he said I got a better idea for salvation and how to worship than you do Lord and what you should do is just accept the way I'm bringing it to you if you knew what was good that's a denomination and when you do the same thing you're a denomination so don't think because we don't have a label attached that you're free of this I say examine yourself daily say Lord help me a sinner saved by grace to stay submitted to your word the no there's somebody spoke to me above and I heard him I don't want to start denominations we got enough what I want to do is be a servant of him love him obey him serve him well the Bible said you're the salt of the earth today you can call yourself a presbyterian that don't mean a thing in the presence of God you can call yourself a Pentecostal doesn't mean a thing in the presence of God what he wants to see is a man or woman that's a Christian in their heart and that's what the world wants to see the world wants to see men and women who are just exactly what they're supposed to be what you profess to be that's the matter with Christianity Today Christianity has no backbone left to it because they're willing to compromise anything in God's word for the appeasement of man and Praises of man over the blessings of God and if you talk to anyone if you talk to atheists you talk to Muslims that is their biggest detractor about Christianity is they will tell you I know people who claim not to even believe in God who live Better Lives than all these people who claim to be Christians so why would I want that if I wasn't if it wasn't for Christ tonight I'd be standing here against him wow that's a powerful statement if it wasn't for Christ tonight I'd be standing here against him and don't think for a minute that's not true of each and every one of us because the father seeketh such to worship Him you didn't go looking for him he came looking for you and he allowed you to find him but I know he's real and I love him that's why I'm here for him no doubt someday we'll seal my testimony with my blood but I'm happy at that day for I know that he's the Lord Jesus Christ I know he cannot fail I know he's love D here some time ago when I lost my family and everything someone met me and said brother Branham did you keep your religion during that time I said no brother it kept me said what do you think of Christ now there's your wife your baby laying Yonder in the grave molding there's your daddy and your brother Lyn Yonder all in a few days apart what do you think about him now I said he's more than life to me I love him with all that's within me a worshiper hardest hour I ever struck in my life just give you a personal testimony he's sharing something with us he said the hardest moment of my entire life of everything I've ever been through when I went into the room of my dying baby there I'd been a gospel preacher for about six years serving God preaching the gospel baptizing people bringing them to Jesus doing everything he could for the kingdom I stood there by my baby they wouldn't let me go in didn't want me to go in but I slipped in it was down in the basement an isolated Ward flies had gone into its little eyes and I shoot the flies out I put a little net like over it I looked at the little thing and I said Sharon do you know your daddy and she had suffered so hard to her little baby blue eyes had crossed you know that went on and followed him his entire life he said there wasn't a single time that I could see a child with cross eyes but I would stop and pray for it remembering this moment my heart was gripped her mother was laying in the morgue the night before the night before this isn't over an extended period of time his wife of just a few years just passed away the mother of the child I got down on my knees and said Heavenly Father what have I done to deserve this will you spare my baby oh blessed Lord please do and it looked like come a black sheep unfolding like that just shut her off from my view he absolutely refused to hear my prayer I stood up and looked at her like that I knew she was gone Satan come to me and he said will you serve him now there's your wife your father's just left your brother was killed up on there on the road there's your wife in the morgue oh yes you're a preacher he ought to be kind to you shouldn't he you're a Christian if God loved you why did he let you be going through these things why would you be suffering doesn't he love you why'd you be going through that trial will you serve him that was the most cruelest Temptation I ever had for there was my baby and what had I done nothing as I note of I said reveal it to me God all make it right Lord you just tell me what I did wrong I'll do whatever I need to do to make it right just don't do this but every son see here's the true worshiper coming out but every son that cometh to God must be chastened and tried then all of a sudden I was left alone to make my decision he didn't have Satan talking to him he didn't have the Lord talking to him I put my hand over on her little head and I said sharing honey the angels are coming to take you home daddy will pack your little body down yonder and lay it in the arms of Mama and I will burrow you out yonder on the graveyard Hill but some glorious day daddy will see you again I raised my hand to him I said Lord if you slay me yet will I trust you I'll love you and that great peace come settling down over me musicians if you will you see this is the heart of the worshiper because worship is not a song worship is not a prayer worship is not some deed that you did to Garner favor but worship is complete and total submission to God's will in your life and how he's moving whether no matter how it looks to you you say Lord I don't understand this I don't get it I don't get why I'm going through this and Lord I don't know why you would want to save me for what I've done the Lord I submit to your will I submit to your will in my life that you are willing to save me and you love me despite what I've done and Lord despite what happens to me I still believe you love me despite what I go through I still believe that you have the best for me in mind it hasn't changed one bit nothing's changed he says I still the thoughts I have for you are good and not evil many times the things we go through we can't see that but we can reach up and hold on to the hand that's guiding and leading us knowing that it's the case knowing he'll see us through knowing that if we will just worship he'll bless it knowing that if in this life like the three Hebrew children going into that fiery furnace [Music] they worshiped they said Lord we don't know whether or not you'll Deliver Us from this fiery furnace but whether you do or not we won't deny you will stand for you they don't have to throw us into the furnace we'll March it knowing that in a moment in time either will be saved from the fire and will be alive on this Earth or in a moment of time we'll be saved from the fire and be standing with you in glory but eat no matter which way you choose to take us we'll serve you nonetheless we'll worship nonetheless that's what Daniel was doing when he when they made the decree that none should worship any but the king [Music] his him going and opening the windows and praying like he always did wasn't just to pray but because he had a scripture that said if you will turn no matter where you're at when Solomon blessed the temple he said no matter where the children of God are at if they will turn and pray towards this spot I will hear their prayer and Daniel knew he had that promise he said no matter what the decree of the king is I have a great my God and I will worship nonetheless see he didn't have a promise that he'd be delivered from the Lion's Den he just had a promise that God would hear his prayer and he worshiped and that's where we stand in life many times is that whether it's something we're going through or something that we could face based on a decision to worship we don't have a promise that you won't go through the Lion's Den you don't even have a promise that you won't be devoured by the Lions you don't have a promise initially that you won't be thrown into the fiery furnace Shadrach Meshach and abendo get didn't have a promise that said if you worship God you will never be in a fiery furnace but they knew if they stayed true God would deliver them one way or the other in our sickness whatever it is we have a promise of healing but God can choose you take you home and heal you just the same looking for his worshipers met whatever you're going through in life and say Lord not my will but thine be done I worship you stand tonight let's just sing this song [Music] one last thing [Music] I just wrote down a little thought and that was if you're unsure about worship if you're unsure about submitting yourself to the Lord and you're unsure about God's Authority in your life giving him full Authority and submitting to him I would say to you consider this if you can't recognize his authority in your life and the direction for your life how is it possible for you to believe that he has authority over anything else if you don't believe he even has authority over you how can he have authority to deliver you how can he have authority to bless you when you won't even commit yourself to him but if you will commit yourself to him recognize his authority come before him in worship stand in such a place of Power with God nothing will stand in your way God bless you let's sing it when peace like a river when peace [Music] foreign [Music] well yeah [Music]
