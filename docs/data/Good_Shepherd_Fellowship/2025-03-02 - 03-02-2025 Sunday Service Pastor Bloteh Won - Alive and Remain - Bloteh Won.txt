Brooks spoke with him in the week and uh uh I think they want to try it and see if it will work so they are closing their service down and and wanting all those that can make it up talking to Brother Sam yesterday I think they're coming Saturday at about 15 to 20 person might be coming Saturday and some are hoping to drive uh Sunday morning to be able to make it so we we're just looking forward to have a wonderful time and uh uh just a time of fellowship and I think it's good for our little space don't get worried amen we we are serving the god that open the rest he can open these walls amen so don't get worried the how God can bless us don't stop panicking don't stop panicking please no panick here amen praise the Lord don't startop panicking amen don't stop panicking if we have an earthquake we just pray we all survive what happened is that now we can have a basement praise the Lord amen amen so we looking forward to that looking forward to that that we all have a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord amen I know when we were having those special meetings years ago it was hard to GA the people from Iowa here you know two years we went down there and supported the meeting and brother Brooks was so heartbroken that you know they couldn't come but this time they are fired up so that we'll look and see it amen we'll look and see they are all they are all fired up and uh uh I'm going to change what I was talking about uh Wednesday night I was talking a little bit on on U uh I was talking on uh uh the move of Vision on this uh the effect of the move of God and what I was trying to bring to us on Wednesday night is for us to just understand when the Bible says one day to God is a thousand years to us we are very slow no matter how fast we try to go because uh uh when when we live in the Spheres of M matter in time it slow us down science prove that that gravity slow us down so uh uh and what what I what what I was trying to help us to see is that when God speak his word because he's not on our time zone the word goes out the word has already goes out we take time to catch up with what God said we take time to catch up with what he promised but his word has already gone out it has already performed what he has said that's the reason why Jesus I mean brother B would said if Jesus was here this morning wearing my suit and you come for prayer he will say I've already done it amen it was already done you just need to catch up with that praise the Lord now you see the reason why that is important is because it it establish our faith in the finished work it's not what you are doing is what he has already done and you have to constantly believe it until it materialize in your body praise the Lord or else we would just we would just be working ourself up and you know and and you know when uh uh uh uh but that's that's what I was trying to bring and you know uh bless his heart after the service my good our good friend brother Derek you know we met out there and we were talking he he he appreciate the service then he he said brother one I I will I will text some things to you I will you know uh we just talk a little bit and I said well send those information to me those are things I have read before but a few of the things that he sent to me uh you know based on the fellowship we had in the service we pre uh he send this uh um Einstein you know uh T of General uh relativity and in there he say the time is also time is also different when uh you start to travel faster if we took a trip traveling as fast at H as the speed of light for six months away from the earth and then and then uh came back for 6 months you will experience that trip as one year of travel you just go 6 months you come back yeah uh and and what happen is there the the person that gos when they come back we become older than them we become older because the tri in the speed of light it does not affect or change their atoms in the way it affect us here praise the Lord amen now we we we talk about the body change is truth though because when the the ones that have left us and have gone before us one fact there is that they didn't go with the body that they had that we know Year Praise the Lord but another fact there is that if they will even come back they will be younger than we are that's why when we look for our loved ones we don't look uh for you know uh them in an older body we look for them in the younger body and I hope I will be able to dwell on there because all all I'm trying to do okay I think I did something wrong here I didn't ping this thing to the back of my so bugging me okay I think it's better now so uh uh that's that's what I was trying to do but last night as I was I was just sitting at my little table and and U running my mind through everything and I realized I I said to myself I'm I'm not a teacher and it looks like I'm just I'm just getting down this path of uh uh you know let let me let me become an evangelist this morning a little bit amen so I'm I'm just going to I'm going to change you know I'm I'm just going to change and just you know uh wake up my elements a little bit praise the lord it's it's making me too slow I'm I'm feeling too heavy because I'm just my mind is just you know so uh I'm going to change this morning let's just stand on our feet let's just stand on our feet let's sing this song We sang it uh uh um uh I love him too much to feel him now amen I love him too much to Break My Vow I promise the Lord that I will make it I will make it any have amen I love you too much to F you now I love him too much to break my V I [Music] promise the Lord that I will make it somehow and now I love him too much to F oh I love him too much to F him [Music] to to break my I

see the different battles and you see the different pressure and everything that God's people are true sometime it good to renew your vow amen praise the Lord thank you musicians let's take our Bibles this morning and we want to we want to uh take first first Tes in chapter 4 that's the uh the promised Rapture the the New Testament uh Rapture scripture first tesalon chapter 4 I was down in Philadelphia a couple of years back and and uh uh one of the brothers were preaching there and then he he he spoke around this and I took the I took this inspiration from there been holding it in my heart for the long time so I was just I was just trying to trying to just change change my channel last night even though it was I kind of a struggle a little bit but I wanted to get out of it and uh uh so first first Thessalonian chapter 4 let's read from verse 13 but I not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that year sorrow even as other which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive praise the Lord amen for this we say unto you by the word word of the of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the AR injured and with uh the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then again we which are alive and remain Paul repeat that again which we which that I alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the cloud to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord let's read the last verse together wherefore Comfort one another with you his words that should be the end of our conversation when we are encouraging one another let's Comfort one another and says sir it will soon be over we will be out of here amen let's keep fighting we will soon be out of here it's going to be better it can never be wor it never remain worse it's going to be better so let's learn to comfort one another with these words let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus I prayed oh God that your grace will just you will come Lord and help us oh father almighty God you know I just uh I turn myself over to you this morning asking that Lord you would just come and use me like a microphone may we fall into that channel where we can be able to Lift Jesus Higher and Lord father God I pray that Lord you will bless your word this morning thank you for this assembly thank you oh god father we have a place to come people of like Precious faith oh god oh no doubt to Father Lord I believe that God they all been praying for the service Lord and praying for one another so father we say here we are everything is ready we can say like Elijah Let the Fire for oh God come and consume our sacrifice this morning in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord this morning we want to speak on uh uh a life and REM we which are a life and remain now you have to you have to realize that this is the qualification for those of us that will be here on Earth to to go to be here and and and and have the body change uh uh uh you have to be alive and remain oh praise the Lord You Have To Be Alive and remain we which are alive and remain let me see you have what uh you can be able to pull out of me this morning now as we were studying on the on the uh the effect of the move of God we we read this scripture we read this quote sorry we read this quote from the spoken word is which is the Original Seed and and and and brother Brandon says now that's why each Revival has its own he says uh each generation has its own Revival and and and you know God raised him up a man and and set him with the word and start him out for the uh with the message he says as soon as the man is taken of the scene somebody else come and and catch it and hybrid it he says if it fall back to be perfect he says I will stop here for a minute we are in know hry see go back that's exactly what it start uh it started wait in the beginning of Genesis God set forth his crup in the human Rays okay that's that's not what I want to get to I will drop down a little bit he says each generation CA is repeating back again to Adam and Eve he says here uh this is what I want to get to it's giving me too much of for read he says now remember okay now I remember correctly that's why each generation has its own Revival it get a chance at the word amen so God gave every one of us a fresh chance at the word that's why we can't live on Pentecostal Revival we can't live on uh you know metad this revival or uh the Luther Revival he gave us a fresh chance at the word amen he gave us an opportunity for us to see when Luther said the judge shall live by faith something from this Bible was quicking in his heart to make him to realize that this word is real I we together praise the Lord when John Wesley was uh was returning back uh from his Revival year in America and on the shap he was with these uh uh uh uh Christian men you know uh and and he realized that this man had something that he never had just imagine he was a preacher he grew up in the church the son of Susanna Wesley and Samuel Wesley that was a preacher he grew up in the church he became an evangelist came to America you know had a Revival but yet in his heart he realized that H uh he need more of God praise the Lord and when he met this man on the ship it changed his life that's how he broke in to his Revival he got a fresh chance of the word so God gave each and every one of us a chance at the word amen he don't want he don't want us going on Mama experience or daddy experience he want you to have your own experience praise the Lord he want you to have your own experience are we together praise the Lord I've done this in in in a long time I have not not done it but it's one of my signature thing I like to do when I talk on the coming of the Lord praise the Lord when I talk on the coming of the Lord I don't I don't have this listed down because I never thought about it last night I will have make it easy and just lce it down for you but you will realize that if you go to the Book of Revelation amen you go to the book of re Revelation you will realize there are the at all at all the ages in the Book of Revelation the seven Church ages they had an experience of the coming of the Lord praise the Lord now I'm I'm trying to bring the thought of each generation having a chance of the word into this so follow me in the little bit Yeah the Bible says here uh uh a promise of of his coming a promise of his coming the Bible talks here in in Revelation chapter 25 remember therefore when thou have fallen and repent and do the first work as I will come unto thee quickly so you see the Ephesus Church age had a promise of his coming are we together amen the Ephesus Church age had a promise of his coming do your first work or else I will come unto thee quickly a promise of his coming are we together amen praise the Lord you love the Lord I said I do this thing now if you go over to the to the pagamas church age uh you look right here in uh verse 16 repent or else I will come unto thee quickly another promise of the coming Ephesus Church has a promise of the coming he says I will come unto thee quickly and uh in the in the uh pagamas Church age we see another promise of his coming and uh now you see I'm just I'm just trying to run my eyes through you now are we together then that the next Church age there will be the it will be the territory of Church age and if you if you look through there too you will see that uh in verse 25 but that which ye have but that which ye have already hold fast till I come so you see every Church age had a promise of his coming are we together praise the Lord I know I have a I have it listed down beautifully I've spoken on this uh uh uh many times different places but then uh you get down also year after the territor church age uh uh you go to the sides Church age verse three remember therefore how thou H re received and H and hold fast and repent if there uh if therefore Thou shalt now watch I will come unto thee another promise again you got to be watching hold to what you have till I come praise the Lord it was a promise to every age hold till I come are we together Philadelphia Church age verse 11 of uh Revelation chapter 3 behold I come quickly hold fast which death ha you see so every age every every age had the promise of his coming are we together after Philadelphia Church a what is the next Church age what's the next Church age lishia say it high don't don't be afraid you will believe it amen laisha Church age and uh uh uh when you look in the Lisha Church a the the Dynamics changed a little bit verse 20 let's look there quickly verse 20 I'm throwing my bait out now I want to get a good cashier that's what I'm doing so I'm I'm just watching the moving of the water I'm throwing my bed out I'm feeling it I'm seeing someone trying to pull amen so yeah verse 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come unto him now the Dynamics change shall little bit in re in in the Lisha church ede because he that was promising I come quickly I come quickly he came and the did I realized that he have come praise the Lord amen he says I'm standing at the door and knocking if he's knocking which mean he's there praise the Lord all the Angels had the promise I will come quick quickly Hold Fast Watch keep watching keep praying I'm coming hold fast watch but in the Lish Church age through the ministry of the son of man we realize that Jesus came standing at the at the door of his church knocking now why why why why will he come to his house is supposed to be his house why will he come and he don't have entrance he has to be knocking praise the lord well in in in a good term if you go back to Revelation chapter 17 and 18 is because the church was caught in adultery she was committing fornication with the kings of the earth so that's the reason why Revelation 184 sounded in Revelation 3 14 come out of home on people because he couldn't go into that adulter system so he said come out of her are we together amen so you see every age has a chance of the word and I believe we are having our chance of the word this morning praise the Lord God is giving us an opportunity to take one more step together from our slumbering our our our laziness our you know backsliding and and and and come to the reality of his pres amen because just like how all of these ages has been yearing I will come quickly I will come quickly that is the same way the gospel has been preached unto us that is the same where the coming of the Lord has been spoken about praise the Lord the Rapture message is preached in you know in in many different ways BR Brown even brought us a story of the man that went out looking for the brde but this morning I want to talk on uh uh uh uh a life and remain a life and remain that that that is the condition where the church the Rapture Church supposed to be in she's not a sleeping virgin amen no she's not a sleeping virgin she's an awake Church she's a a church that must be a life praise the Lord no matter what we are going through we must fight it to live praise the lord we must be able to fight through it alive and remain you love the Lord this morning praise the Lord I just wish you you pull me out of all of these notes then I have don't have have nothing to say we prayed and go home brother bam says now I choose this he's talking about the message how can I overcome he says now I choose this because that I think that it is a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die praise the Lord amen you see that's the reason why we talking about the move of God because what is Revival Revival is the move of God when God move in power praise the Lord amen and and and that's what the spirit of Revival is to the church is the move of God God is moving Us in different ways amen he's moving us he's changing our ideas you know he's taking us from a legalistic approach to the word he's taking us into a loving relationship with him is now dos and done praise the Lord hallelujah that will be a horrible marriage if we just have our list of what I like and what I don't like I give it to you study it memorize it that will be a horrible marriage praise the Lord it must be a love affair are we together amen we must be able to accommodate we must be able to compromise praise the Lord amen you say you don't believe in compromise wait until you get married now I choose this because that I think that is a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival di we have got to keep are we together we have got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day every day praise the Lord you know when you wake up in the morning you know what makes you to do like [Music] this revival I don't know which position you sleep on but you kept those bones like that all through the night and when you wake up in the morning you try to revive it man I'm tired praise the Lord sometime that is not enough you need a cup of coffee I know I do praise the Lord what are you doing you trying to revive yourself you're trying to come alive amen you want to get out

jealousy about argument about envying he don't care about what what next you become become the president of the of the United States he don't care about that amen as long as he can give you a dead brain are we together to be instant with life and vagor oh my goodness in a sense of a a sense peculiar to himself oh man to be a life of cheered and and hopeful feelings hopeful feelings I mean when you get there you bring light in the room you find ways to cheer people up praise the Lord find ways to cheer people up you try to make them laugh if they are not laughing hold them by the shoulder and shake them a little bit they might be dead praise the lord we just living in a depressing time praise the Lord just depressing time the whole news is depressing I see the prayer request of our sister this morning and just just last week uh uh uh there was there was another attack in a in a in a hospital in Philadelphia you know man got right there in the I see you beat a nurse uh uh almost to death praise the Lord you mean hospital where those people are there trying to help life now where is the savior place if they are going into hospitals going into church where is the savior's Place Christ Jesus are we together praise the Lord to be alive with Che and hope fulfilling to be alive in a state of Salvation from spiritual death we that are alive and remain which mean there will be a people on the Earth there will be a people on the Earth that this world will keep making Rejoice they will keep rejoicing in the word they will keep uh being H H revived by the word stimulated by the word amen when the devil had had Dam other people Spirit polluted their minds that they argue with every truth everything you throw their way they argue with it he had darken their Spirit praise the Lord you even tell them you're looking good they get mad what do you mean by I'm looking good what do you mean why if I was say you didn't you are not looking good why if I say you were not looking good I'll be dead but we that are alive amen and remain that word remains have to do with abiding Amen to remain in to continue to abide to hold fast we saw that through through the AG through all of those promise hold fast to that what you have don't let it get away from you praise the Lord what don't let it get away from you and that and and that is the place where uh H uh uh uh the church we need another dose of the spirit of God Amen we need to say God you gave me the dose don't come to the place where you said I have the Holy Ghost and you just think it's enough no you need a dose every day amen because there a lot of influence out there there a lot of influence out there and many times we get Frozen in it praise the lord we see lot of lies we see lot of immorality and all and we just care oh wow go fast to what you have amen go fast to the value that the grace of God has given you be proud of it praise the Lord hallelujah amen be proud of it down year in the How can I overcome he goes on he says I I was crossing an old law the other day and down and watch all what is called a hollow praise the Lord amen something just came to my mind I come back to that and you know uh during the week uh uh brother Lawrence gave me the call and and I I I just I felt so blessed with our little conversation we had I think the you know the their night uh uh uh prayer meeting and think the they were doing is somewhere there in the Book of Judges so you know last week we we spoke a little bit about the rare haer you know uh taking her as a type of Christ amen uh Christ in Bride form because uh she's a female now so what there uh uh there in in in the Book of Judges you remember Samson referring to his his girlfriend as Maher he told the Phil the the Philistine you won't get this thing until you temper with Myer you know so it looks like that CAU is mine you know and he called me and and then you know and then we we I was I was just I was just sitting there and and what was happening to me is that I was thinking in my mind see how God can bring his word Al life amen yeah uh the preacher might not have the the ability to really break it down but the Holy Ghost can be able to pick up something and just you know and just make that word real to you amen so when he called me I mean I was just I was blessed with the conversation praise the Lord hallelujah and it's it's very beautiful when you studed on there it's very very beautiful and and I think that is the place where you know uh uh uh you know uh sisters we we get our comfort we get our strength from you know because uh uh uh uh we we we living we living in a world you know where with with all the the struggle that and gender struggle and everything that is going on in the in the present world that we are living in you know people will come to the church and see us and say oh no you know uh uh uh uh you guys approach it you you put you put the women down and all of that I mean she has a very special place in the scripture you will you will not believe it the amount of types the amount of places where the woman type Christ praise the Lord when Jesus say I will H you as a hand that's a type of the right I mean the hand is not it's not a male it's a female praise the Lord when God appeared to Abraham like elshad is not a male is the breasted one it's a female praise the Lord so you see she has this hidden place because the strength of the woman is hidden praise the Lord amen the strength of the woman is hidden yeah like like like we learn from the word you know God plac it in those Godly virtues that he gives to woman praise the Lord and and and and if the grace can come for our young sisters to be able to grab the revelation of that amen praise the Lord they will know that I mean no there there is no Philistine boy in the word can be able to talk anything in their ear because they realize that uh you know that this joy that I have the word didn't give it to me this virtue that I have the word didn't give it to me the world can't take it away praise the Lord I mean beautiful types to see how she typed the red half her you know uh uh uh she was the one that the promise of redemption is given to I mean it's it's just beautiful I just believe that is uh the ignorance or Revelation that makes people to think that the woman is uh you know she's she's cast down she's nothing she she she's so uh no no no God has a very special place for her amen and so much that he he gave her the the the the promise of redemption because she has the mystery of redemption are we together I'm almost feel feel feel like changing my my subject now and just go into that direction and just show you tipes over ties that is right in the scripture that speaks of the place of the woman how special she is to God you think about it that was the animal for sacrifice that's what Israel cannot have their Temple worship because they don't have that animal and see the way that God designed it the harer is never born M praise the Lord and when they have that that haer and and and they burn it they got to use the a sparingly because I mean it might not appear for many years how manyan we can go down this road and uh and what a blessing it is amen now so he speak here he says uh getting over that Old Log and what what is called Hollow he talks about that you know he was going over a rotten log he says and that is the way uh the Christians are becoming uh they've been dead in sin and trespass so long till become dting they can hold no way praise the Lord amen they can hold no weight I heard I heard one one old old preacher friend saying you know uh uh he says uh I mean if if uh if you know if if they should uh if they should arrest us they won't have enough to accuse us off of being Christian because the church has driven so much to the world that there would not be enough to to accuse them of being Christians praise the Lord the only thing that that is left with the church is just a profession brother bam say she loves her weight they hold no weight they don't know what the overcoming means I begin to think on the text then over coming keep life in you that's what overcoming means we can be all submerged with everything that is happening but keep life in you praise the Lord have the desire to live have the desire to bounce back praise the Lord no what no matter what I'm going through I will get out of this tell yourself over and over I will get out of this the desire to live the desire to to to to to bounce back the desire to fight through you just don't surrounder yourself to situation well you know well you know well you know you already dead overcome keep life in you when life went out that's what uh brought the Lord to that condition and it made it worse than ever when it lays in the branch where the water was praise the Lord and then there you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him let the life of the only thing you would just have a profession you would just have a profession the desire to tell truth will go away praise the Lord it start with one lie it becomes a habit praise the Lord and you become so so good at it that you can lie and and you know make people to believe that you're telling the truth are we together you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him and the experience you see then and I just telling a friend of mine you know talking yesterday fellowshipping I tell I says you see that's that's what happened we we we come to this place where we want so much Liberty and we blame the church oh yeah we are just legalistic everything were legalistic everything was legalist you see God did not bring the church out of catholism like that it was not from catholism to Pentacost no he started bringing them out by Reformation to justification Luther into sanctification but what is happening today people come and and they just want to get rid of legalism before you realize they far away from the truth they are far away from the truth they are not allowing God to cleanse them they are not allowing God to change them they are not allowing God to show them why they must not do this but they take they take it against the preacher or the take it against the message or the take it against the Bible to take it against Christianity and then before you realize they fire away they are worshiping Earth I believe in Earth who made the Earth I'm a I'm I'm I'm spiritual I believe in the universe I believe in wi you will not believe some of the things that people believe you think you believe let the life of God go from then and experience the joy of serving Christ and living in the church where such is going on the joy of serving Christ the joy that we once had praise the Lord the joy of being a Christian Don't Let It Go from you praise the Lord no matter how the how the damn Christianity and all the the dirt to throw on it and all everything they said don't let that Joy go from you amen are we together we that are alive and remain we have to be up and doing Church praise the lord we have to be up and doing we're not making ourself public Saints we are not Fanatics to go and provoke people to go and insult people no but we must remain we must abide in his presence until a aura of his presence goes with you you sit down and somebody just say I knew there was something there just something about that girl it's the it's the aura of his presence it's not you bashing at everybody and and you know trying to make yourself uh known when you don't have nothing to show are we together so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the Life of Christ we should live constantly in the Life of Christ every day was a good day Genesis chapter 1 every day when God finished the day he said it was good and as Sons and Daughters let's come to the end of our day feeling fulfilled there might be a lot of things we never get done but feel fulfilled find a sense of fulfillment I thank God I'm back home you can feel fulfilled just by your family look in the face of your children your wife you just okay yeah if nothing good happened here something good is happening right here you feel fulfilled when you listening to the word of God because it takes your mind from all the trouble and it give you a promise of a millennium it give you a promise of a new birth it give you a promise of the Rapture that makes me feel fulfilled praise the Lord we are trying to follow the message of the hour at least this part of the message we should live constantly constantly in the Life of Christ see because if you don't you lay around and know that these things that you supposed to do and don't do it if you don't you just lay around I'm a message believer I'm in the message I'm in the message before you realize it's just a slogan for you the inner power is is not there the inner desire is not there praise the lord we must not just lay around and hold a a profession let's get doing all these days we can get on the phone and and and and uh uh and and and encourage a brother we can get on the phone and even pray with a sister if you don't you you you you L around and know these things that you're supposed to do then don't do it the Bible says he that know it to do good and does it n to him it sin then you become Dy rotting when you suppose when when you are separated from life from the life of God so strive with all that's in you the little strength that is left praise the Lord remember there's a prophet that told you when the weakest Christian get down on their knees use that little strength and drag yourself to God say father I come praise the Lord I'm losing it because I mean the devil is there to sound a loud you are nothing you are backsliding you are nothing you just fooling yourself he he sounds so loud but that stay verse is calling you in your heart amen it's calling drag yourself to the house of God drag yourself uh to to on your knees to pray amen you say I listen to the message I don't hear anything keep listening amen keep listening just keep listening we that are alive and remain that is the promise we that are alive and remain we must remain in the truth amen now we that are alive and have forsaken the message now we that I have life and you know and and turn on God we we must me we must be out a place out a position our post of Duty remaining in the truth abiding in the truth praise the Lord there will be a people hallelujah there will be one day one year but there will be a people because God is never without a witness he's never without a witness praise the Lord Hallelujah Supernatural he says right here you see the failure of the church the Pentecostal Church the Methodist Church the Baptist and all is a failure of that abiding grace of God abiding grace of God we want it we we want I mean everything is just becoming like a cash app we want to Quake we want to cash it in qu no stay there believe the word hold wait that abiding grace of God still right there hold to the promise are we together he says that is the failure you will shout you will clap your hands dance in the eyes speak in tongues that's gift gift is no good unless you are abiding in the shakana glory praise the Lord unless you are abiding in the Shak of Glory because pretty soon you will realize that uh I mean uh uh you don't even know what they said when you say Amen you don't even know when they said before you clap your hands because you are not abiding we that are alive and remain praise the Lord hallelujah I mean we we we we have all these little spiritual discipline that we had you know we we we we set up a little time for meditation a little time for for for for praying a little time for this but all of those things is becoming redundant why why are they becoming like that why are we feeling that they are not important because we are in an internet age no that's the that's the time where they're supposed to be more important because if I can't carry my Bible I have it on the phone when that time I can set an alarm on my phone to be able to remind me at 12:00 I just need to get a slice of word to meditate on I can set that up I can abide in that my day might be so busy but I can set an alarm to remind me my alarm R ring said be grateful I look at be grateful oh my thank you Lord praise the Lord amen thank you Lord just that moment just that moment it helps me to abide praise the Lord because I know I have to get out there I have to get things done praise the Lord Lord it used to be those days people write their memory verse uh of the day they put it in their pocket in their upper pocket when they work work work the take it up the Lord is my shepherd they put it back again they work work work work what what are you doing you are abiding you see the the time time is becoming busy time is becoming and and we ourself also we must prepare for the time that we are in are we together so gifts are no good unless you are abiding in the shakana glory if now you will realize your gift is going from you even if it is singing even if it is just you know a joyful person if you are not finding time to keep that that that sacred thing that God gave you in his presence in a time of meditation a time of uh uh uh uh uh you know concentration it will go away from you that's just the parable of he that have much much is given to him and it is taken from the one that is not making use of it why because you're not keeping it in his presence are we together you are living in the presence of the shakana glory the atmosphere around you is ging it's an abiding presence to know the word of God then don't look what the word what the word going to say about you is what God thinks about you praise the Lord I mean that's the reason why all the you know everything that is going on just get to us so easily because we are abiding the wrong place if we are abiding in his presence amen and taking his promises commit your ways to the Lord and He will direct your path he will direct your thoughts all of those things are promises if I'm abiding in that and and and committing it to the Lord I don't care what people say praise the Lord I don't care what they say I'm about in his presence because I know he can make a truth amen he can bring his word to pass he's able to bring his word to pass praise the Lord he's able to bring his word to pass Hallelujah he says I will build a church and the gates of hell would not Prevail against it I can abide in that amen I can abide in that truth and say Lord no matter what what what uh what is going on no matter how the enemy is uh you know uh uh you know coming against our people coming against the church Lord you said you will build your church and the gifts of hell will not pre against it I can abide in that truth amen that's where we must be in this hour alive and remain they that are alive and remain they are the one that will receive the body change they are the one that will be caught up they other the one that will not be deceived are we together it's abiding is an abiding presence to know the word of God then don't look at what the word going to said about you is what God thinks about you then you are living in his presence he takes this other thought year that comparing lot with Abraham and there was lot walking right along with Abraham who was a Believer but he didn't have that constant abiding presence of God praise the Lord that constant abiding presence we can come into the service you feel the presence of God you feel the conviction of God but if you don't have the constant abiding presence you go away from it because we we create you Crea in the atmosphere amen we come to together we AFF flame our faith and we create an atmosphere if you don't have a constant abiding presence you feel good when you are in church you feel miserable when you go away then you need a constant abiding presence praise the Lord because he said I will be with you even to the end of the age that's what he promised that's his promise amen that's your that's your rapture Enoch had a constant abiding presence he walk with God and he was n it was a constant abiding presence praise
