[9:34] tonight we want to thank the Lord
[9:37] together for giving us another privilege
[9:39] to come in the house of the Lord this
[9:41] evening on Sunday we were reading the uh
[9:46] portion of the cup there from the the
[9:48] Sunday School tape and brother B was
[9:50] talking about those that uh s and cry
[9:54] for the Abomination that is done in the
[9:57] City of Minneapolis and uh uh right
[10:02] after the service when we went home and
[10:05] looking through the the the news field
[10:09] uh uh on my on my
[10:11] phone realized that uh the city of
[10:17] Burnsville all through the night uh had
[10:20] a they had a case there where the city
[10:23] lost two of uh the police officer and
[10:26] one
[10:27] paramedic and and uh and what I was just
[10:31] reading there through the news and it
[10:33] just hit my mind and uh uh thinking on
[10:37] the very
[10:38] thought of the things that are done
[10:41] within our city but here he said the
[10:44] Lord watch over us and
[10:46] uh keep us
[10:49] together you watch over our going out
[10:52] and our coming
[10:53] in and sometimes we can go an entire de
[10:57] and not even realizing all the wrongs
[10:59] and all the evils that are done around
[11:01] us it's not
[11:04] because we are perfect it's all
[11:08] because he promised to build a wall of
[11:11] protection around us he promised to give
[11:14] his Angel charge over us and and all of
[11:18] these things bring us to the place where
[11:20] we we uh learn to appreciate the grace
[11:24] of God and that's what I want for us to
[11:26] do tonight I want for us to live our
[11:29] voices together and just thank the Lord
[11:32] and toight I was uh just spending some
[11:36] time in thinking about this to realize
[11:39] that 59 years ago brother Brandon
[11:41] preached that message marriage and
[11:44] divorce and I was thinking about it uh
[11:48] uh and just saying uh what a message of
[11:52] Pardon what a message of
[11:56] grace and the thought that was on my
[11:58] mind
[11:59] of which I I tried to put these dates in
[12:03] in
[12:04] places it is
[12:06] all in the place that
[12:09] uh those men that we read out of the
[12:12] scripture they walk on this very same
[12:16] Earth those messages were preached in
[12:18] the same
[12:21] country the Revival took place
[12:24] here you walk on this same street d
[12:27] drove around this place maybe they were
[12:29] not paved like the way they are but it
[12:33] is right on this same Earth and this is

[42:13] battle hallelujah amen hallelujah so by
[42:18] the grace of God and just approach the
[42:21] word of life and talk on on God's word
[42:25] and I want to speak this this evening on
[42:29] respect lead to the right approach to
[42:32] Christ respect lead to the right
[42:35] approach to Christ and I just read the
[42:38] book of Psalm 65 verse4 because the
[42:43] Bible said blessed is the man whom the
[42:46] Lord
[42:47] chooses so we can see if you to approach
[42:51] Christ God have to call you and it's a
[42:54] blessing for God to call you and not
[42:56] only calling you but trues you
[42:59] hallelujah it's a blessing because not
[43:01] everybody can come to him because Jesus
[43:04] said in his word no man can come except
[43:07] the father draw him so it take it's a
[43:09] blessing for God to call you and for God
[43:11] to chooses you to come unto him
[43:13] Hallelujah so the Bible say say blessed
[43:16] is the man whom the Lord chooses and
[43:19] causes to approach unto thee that he may
[43:22] dwell in the court and we shall be set
[43:27] with the goodness of that house even to
[43:31] that Holy Temple so when God call you
[43:34] it's a blessing when God chooses you
[43:36] it's a blessing I say many are cou few
[43:38] are chosen when God call you then God
[43:41] can chooses you and when God don't
[43:43] choose you you cannot approach him
[43:46] Hallelujah but when God call you he
[43:48] chooses you then give you Grace to come
[43:50] before his throne to approach him or
[43:52] else you going to approach the Lord
[43:54] hallelujah so he said then he call CES
[43:56] you chues you to approach him that he
[43:58] can dwell in his Temple Hallelujah so
[44:02] you can see that that is what the word
[44:03] of God says that is what you look in the
[44:05] book of Psalm you look in the book of
[44:07] Psalm
[44:09] 101:1 the Bible said for the fear of God
[44:12] is a beginning of what wisdom yes the
[44:15] fear of God is a beginning of wisdom a
[44:17] good understanding have all did th do
[44:21] his commandment his Praises endures
[44:24] forever so you can see the fear of God
[44:26] the begin of wisdom and no fear bring
[44:29] what respect Hallelujah if you don't
[44:32] fear Him you cannot respect him when you
[44:34] fear him then you respect him Hallelujah
[44:36] and respect bring what reverence
[44:39] Hallelujah and when you reverence and
[44:41] you have respect and you have fear then
[44:44] it will lead to the right approach if
[44:47] you don't have fear you don't have
[44:48] reverence you don't respect and you
[44:50] don't have fear your approach will be
[44:52] different Hallelujah watch those who
[44:55] don't have no respect have no fear for
[44:57] the things of God hallelujah or ins for
[44:59] their parents or for their loved ones
[45:00] for their wife or for their husband
[45:02] Hallelujah they watch the approach how
[45:05] they approach situations in the home how
[45:07] they
[45:08] children approach issue between children
[45:11] and what and parents if they not fear
[45:13] the parents not have respect for their
[45:14] parents watch how they talk to their
[45:15] parents watch how they do certain things
[45:17] Hallelujah but if you have respect you
[45:20] have fear your approaches will be
[45:21] different and how you see things will be
[45:23] different Hallelujah so in the house of
[45:26] God the Bible say blessed are those it's
[45:27] a blessing to approach him and to
[45:30] approach him you have you have fear you
[45:32] may have reverence if you reverence him
[45:34] then you approach him in the right
[45:36] manner but if you don't have no respect
[45:37] don't have no approach then your your
[45:39] attitude will be contrary to God's word
[45:42] hallelujah then lead to a disobedient
[45:45] spirit because of no respect and no
[45:47] respect lead to God God always allow
[45:50] those who approach him you don't
[45:51] approach God anyhow you might come with
[45:54] with reverence you might come Express
[45:56] with fear you might come expressing with
[45:58] dedication Hallelujah and when you come
[46:01] you might come expecting and what you
[46:03] expect is what you receive it's just a
[46:05] simple thing Hallelujah so it's how you
[46:07] approach God Is So relevant we don't
[46:09] approach God anyhow that when you coming
[46:11] to God's present come prepare come
[46:14] expecting come pray up you don't enter
[46:16] God's pres anyhow or you don't enter
[46:19] God's pres any way when you come into
[46:21] His pres you might know you are coming
[46:22] in the Pres of the great king so how you
[46:25] approaching how do you come a person
[46:27] that's why many people come to church
[46:28] and don't get nothing from God because
[46:30] they don't come with
[46:32] respect hallelujah amen so if you are
[46:35] coming to his presence you man to
[46:37] approach him and you may approach him
[46:39] respect hallelujah amen is what the
[46:42] Bible said the fear of the Lord is a
[46:44] beginning of wisdom because you fear God
[46:47] you get wisdom and wisdom lead to
[46:49] understanding wisdom will lead to how we
[46:52] do certain things in life Hallelujah
[46:54] because wisdom is the word of God Amen
[46:57] and the Bible said in the scripture in
[46:58] the book of Psalm 128:1 the Bible said
[47:02] blessed is everyone thou fearest the
[47:05] Lord and thou walk in his ways because
[47:08] when you fear Him you Reverend him
[47:10] you'll walk in his ways you walk
[47:13] according to God's word amen because you
[47:15] get out reever you get out fear if you
[47:17] don't respect him you don't walk in his
[47:19] word hallelujah you don't you don't take
[47:21] his advis you don't take his instruction
[47:24] but when you fear Him you walk in his
[47:26] ways you will take instruction and you
[47:28] will take advice in the house of God
[47:30] hallelujah the B say what blessed is
[47:33] everyone thou fear the lord and walk in
[47:35] his ways it said for thou shall eat the
[47:38] labor of thy hand so you fear God you
[47:41] eat the label of your hands you fear God
[47:44] how God will guide your life Hallelujah
[47:46] if you fear God and you you order your
[47:48] steps he said how shall thou be and a
[47:51] shall be well with
[47:53] thee Hallelujah they shall be well with
[47:56] the if you fear him if you love him you
[47:58] fear him if you love me keep my
[48:00] commandment if you fear him you know how
[48:01] to do certain things in your own life
[48:03] the Bible say to the scriptures the wife
[48:05] shall be as a fruitful van by the side
[48:09] of down house and th children shall be o
[48:12] plan and run about that table behold
[48:15] that thou shall the man be blessed
[48:18] blessed th fear the lord you see it B
[48:21] say thou shall be the portion of the man
[48:23] woman young boys young girls that fear
[48:25] of God
[48:26] Hallelujah remember the the god in the
[48:28] days of your youth Hallelujah and in
[48:31] your youthful age you might Rend God you
[48:33] may re the things of God and may fear
[48:35] him it's what the Bible say bless is a
[48:37] man whom the Lord chooses to approach
[48:40] him who the Lord chooses to come before
[48:42] his presence who the Lord chooses to
[48:44] enter his Gates is that is why the book
[48:47] of Psalm 100:3 said know ye the Lord he
[48:52] is God and it is he that made us not
[48:57] ourself we are his people and a sheep of
[49:01] what his
[49:04] pasture hallelujah amen enter in his
[49:08] gates with Thanksgiving and into his
[49:11] court with praises be thanks he be
[49:14] thanksful unto him and bless his name
[49:17] for the Lord is good and his Mercy is
[49:20] Everlasting and his truth endureth to
[49:23] all generation
[49:26] Hallelujah so bless the man that the
[49:28] Lord chooses causes to approach him amen
[49:31] so they what and they when you when you
[49:34] respect him then you'll know how to
[49:37] approach him hallelujah amen so that is
[49:40] why God said bless the man that God
[49:42] chooses to approach him and now because
[49:44] it's not
[49:45] everyone that can approach him
[49:47] hallelujah it's only when God call you
[49:50] you can approach him that he may dwell
[49:52] in his court and be certified in what
[49:55] what his Temple so when you when when
[49:59] when when you when God call you you'll
[50:01] be satifying God's presence you'll be
[50:04] happy to be in the person of the king
[50:07] you'll rejoice in the person with with
[50:09] the King why David said I was glad when
[50:11] they said to me let go to the house of
[50:13] the Lord because God call and a bread in
[50:16] your heart that is why a true Christian
[50:19] a Believer when you respect him you
[50:21] don't D to
[50:23] church Hallelujah you don't come to
[50:25] church anyhow you can't prepare you
[50:28] can't pray up and you come expecting
[50:31] Hallelujah because that's is the prayer
[50:33] God bring the Mage come conduct all
[50:35] Uline how we conduct oursel in God's
[50:38] presence How We Gather 10 30 minutes of
[50:40] the time you might be on time in church
[50:42] we don't come our we don't choose our
[50:45] own way Hallelujah we must come God say
[50:49] Min the time we can't prepare we can't
[50:51] pray up we come expecting we don't come
[50:54] anyhow they see when we going to the job
[50:56] we on time when you come to God's pres

[51:06] pray or come prepare come praying and
[51:09] trusting God for your Christian Life
[51:11] hallelujah amen he said blessed is the
[51:14] man who the Lord chooses because not
[51:15] everybody go can call that you may dwell
[51:17] in your court and you might be stify in
[51:20] his Temple amen satify his Temple that
[51:23] is what Psalm psalm 16: 19 said in the
[51:27] court of the house in the court of the
[51:30] Lord house in the midst of the old
[51:32] Jerusalem praise ye the
[51:36] Lord and notice pray God told us the
[51:39] approach to God God has a way of an
[51:42] approach he say you know if you are
[51:45] going to visit the king there's an
[51:47] approach to the king Hallelujah that
[51:50] there is a way to approach he said well
[51:54] it make it it it may be more simple than
[51:57] that but a boy that want to approach a
[51:59] young lady to get acquainted with her
[52:02] there's a certain way he approach a
[52:04] young lady and my Approach that young
[52:06] lady will respect and reverence feel my
[52:09] reverence you my respect her to approach
[52:11] her you don't approach a young girl
[52:13] anyhow should you don't just say see
[52:16] some the street I you might approach
[52:18] certain way and take note even in the
[52:20] home there certain we approach our
[52:23] parents our mother a certain way we
[52:25] approach our dad Hallelujah certain way
[52:28] we approach our children amen so you can
[52:31] see that as a mod how you approach your
[52:33] children a different you approach your
[52:35] husand hallelujah oh yes sir and and the
[52:39] children they different you approach
[52:40] your mama different approach or that but
[52:43] everything is approach to a situation
[52:45] everything is approach to it so in God
[52:49] house there's approach of everything
[52:51] according to God's
[52:53] word amen
[52:55] oh yes sir that is why in dealing with
[52:58] dealing with the parents you don't talk
[52:59] to your parents anyhow when your parents
[53:01] talking to you you don't just walk out
[53:04] it will be a dis disobedient Spirit
[53:07] Hallelujah and to have long life obey
[53:09] your parents in the law for this is
[53:11] right and parents provoke children to
[53:16] anger hallelujah oh you want to you
[53:19] don't Prov no anger balance the word
[53:22] amen the same way children be obedient
[53:26] to parents respect the parents and when
[53:28] you respect your parents you know that
[53:30] when God is in your life it all bring
[53:32] respect in your life so you don't talk
[53:34] anyhow in the home amen because the home
[53:37] that is Godly you all have God's pres in
[53:40] that
[53:41] home hallelujah amen so always there's
[53:45] approach to things and you don't
[53:47] approach things anyhow so there a
[53:49] certain way to approach issues amen and
[53:52] when you have respect for a lady you
[53:55] approach her will
[53:57] respect Hallelujah you not approach her
[54:01] and you treat as a lady Hallelujah there
[54:04] is a way to approach all things and
[54:06] there is a way to approach God if we
[54:08] don't know the approach to God will
[54:11] never be able to get an audience with
[54:15] God the pray God said so if you don't
[54:19] approach him you not get audience for
[54:21] for him it's the same way as a child if
[54:24] you don't have to approach your parents
[54:25] they don't give you
[54:28] audience Hallelujah if you talking to
[54:30] your mama you know you talking to your
[54:32] mama you not to talk to your mama is
[54:34] Mama talking shout then they talking to
[54:38] them they go out and slam the door
[54:40] behind them it's on respectful Spirit
[54:43] hallelujah it's a sound that you don't
[54:44] have God a sound that you not yet born
[54:47] again if something your heart you don't
[54:49] just stamp your do your mama anyhow
[54:52] hallelujah oh yes sir amen
[54:55] amen and also also the same way as a
[54:59] wife you talk you don't talk to your
[55:00] husband anyhow oh I boss talk your
[55:03] husband with
[55:04] respect amen oh yes sir and also as a
[55:08] husband you talk to your wife with
[55:11] respect you might know that is a wife
[55:14] hallelujah oh yes
[55:16] sir amen so you can see that it's in the
[55:19] family Christ say and I show you a
[55:22] mystery Christ and his bride and God
[55:25] telling us that he said if you don't
[55:27] know the approach to God will never be
[55:31] able to get an audience with God so we
[55:34] have to know how to approach him in said
[55:37] in the house of God if you respect
[55:39] things in the church then you not to
[55:41] approach issue in the
[55:44] church hallelujah oh yes sir because
