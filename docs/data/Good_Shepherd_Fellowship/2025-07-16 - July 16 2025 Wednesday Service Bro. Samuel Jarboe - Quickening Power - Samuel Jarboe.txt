I just want to read this from the message expectation. Brother Brandham said there are times I didn't like to be all alone with Christ my Lord. I can tell him all my trouble all alone. That's what we need again. Them kind of meetings, that kind of a church, that's the kind of church that pray down the blessings of God. And I'm sure your pastor will appreciate every member becoming like there praying down the blessing of God. Amen. and uh and that's what we we've been trying to labor on. We've been laboring to have a praying church and uh and the Lord is blessing us. We we want to be thankful for that. Uh just like Moses said, we're not going to leave anyone behind. So tonight, we just we just want to take few prayer needs here. And uh this knee came in just this afternoon. This is from Brother Andrew Bos out there in Shivak, Alaska. I received this from a pole workers uh and she is a tribal administrator and she writes, "Andrew, I really need prayers for strength. hearing that Michael 2 years 2 years old needing a social security card to get Medicaid and needing surgery. It weighs on me. My sister Mea 36 got news that she is 6 months or less uh 6 month or less cause of her alcohol consumption. Her kidney isn't working well and the liver filling. Uh Melanius 15 years old appendicites was bursted and we need surgery eventually but has an infection internally. My mind want to strain but need to re to remain strong is high right now. The need to remain strong is high right now. And she asked she had another need uh mash won't stop drinking. And uh so this is a prayer need from uh um way back there. You can just see the crowd of this mother's hut. And uh and we want to also remember uh the family uh brother Brother Michael Cole and his wife James back u home. U they had a devastating fire situation that took uh uh that took the life of three of their children and then uh uh another one was severely burned but and then she did not survive. Uh that's their first daughter. She was also expecting so they have to lost five person from that fire. Uh that news came in on Saturday and it was it really bothe us all through the night to the morning. uh we had to uh control ourself just to be able to uh prepare ourself for service and then uh uh just been praying and been uh trusting that God will be able to help them through and uh um so we want to remember them tonight. There's a prayer need also here from sister Na mean my brother Joer continuing uh prayers even though he's being put on hospice care he's still believing God to restore his health and we believe that God can do it. Amen. Praise the Lord. And uh second prayer need here for brother Greg Charles. He's requesting prayer. his bathroom in a cancer demon surgery set for for the 30th of this month. We want to take brother Greg before the Lord uh tonight and uh and saints I want us to to remember and realize and when these prayer needs comes in a lot of these people we don't we might we don't know them and some of them we might never meet in this life but Jesus know their needs Jesus know what they are dealing with Jesus know what they are going through he's touched by the feelings of their infirmities and uh and uh I want us to take this knees seriously to the Lord in prayer. If we if we bow our heads to pray, if you can remember all and you can just remember one, pray about that one. Just just don't let us not just uh you know uh uh miss the opportunity of uh experiencing or expressing the greatest love that can ever be expressed. Jesus said it's for the man to lay down his life for his friend. And the best way you can lay down your life for the brother or the sister is to go before God. So we just want to take these knees now as we just uh sing this chorus one more time. [Music] as he goes by. Yes. Reach out and touch the Savior. I see he passes by.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe there is no better place than the house of the Lord. David said, "I was glad when he said unto me, let us go in the house of the Lord." Sav said, "It is better to be in the house of the Lord than to be in the tent of the wicked." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm grateful to God for this opportunity to come in the midst of the believers uh to fellowship around God's word. I want to extend my greetings from the believers in Philadelphia. They ask me to extend the greetings and all great in the things of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Also want to extend the greetings for my wife, my family and also extend the greetings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Also want to thank the pastor for giving me this opportunity to come and share the word with us this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm grateful to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I don't want to waste much of your time. We just go quickly into the word and see what they don't have for all this evening. Shall we stand to our feet? &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the house of God tonight? &gt;&gt; Shake your friend hand say God bless you. Amen. Let's go to the book of Genesis. We read the go book of Genesis chapter one. Amen. Excuse me. Genesis chapter 1:es 1 to 5. The scripture said, "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light day and the darkness he called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. Shall bow heads to pray. Our gracious Lord Jesus, we want to commit the word into your hand tonight. We pray you bless it. We sanctify God. May the word be alive in our house tonight. Lord, bless the word. Inspire us this evening. Bless the sons and daughters who are on the church and those who are here tonight. We pray you bless our hearts to your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Shall be seated. Shall we go to the book of Romans? Amen. Let go to the book of Romans chapter 8. Romans chapter 8 11. Amen. Romans chapter 8 vers 11. The Bible say, "But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelt in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you." Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So tonight, I want to just encourage us a little exhortation. I want to speak on quickening power. Amen. Quickening power. The word quicken means to bring alive to make something get alive. Is to put life into something. When he say something is quicken is to put life into it to make it alive. You know that's what the word quickening mean. I want to read a quote from is the rising of the sun 3738. So we also read just keeping in mind what we read in Genesis. The Bible say in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the Bible say the earth was without form and the earth was void. And the Bible says and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Bible said and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and the Bible say and there was light. Amen. So we see Reban said he said there was a time when the world was laying out darkness. It was without form and was void and it was all covered with water. It was laying there in darkness glowing at the fear and the spirit of God moved upon the waters and said let there be light. God had a reason to do that for down believe the water there was seas that he had planted and he had to have that sunlight to make it alive. Amen. So in the beginning in Genesis when God said let there be light. The Bible said there was light and the Bible said the spirit of God move upon the face of the waters and and and and and God that light begin to push away the darkness but on the on the earth. The Bible said there were seas that were there. So it only took the light to strike the seed. So once the light was to strike the seed, it quicken that seed and make that seed to live. Amen. And the Bible say and B Brown say and the first light was ever given in the earth was God's spoken word. The first light that ever struck the earth was God's spoken word. He said let there be light and there was light that turn the darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth. So when when the when when God said let there be light and there was light that that spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters though the earth was dark it was gloomy it was dismal but when the light struck the earth it push away the darkness and the Bible say there were seas in the earth praise the name of the Lord and because there were seas in the earth the seas in the earth were quaking by the light of God praise God so because that seas they were predestinated to life if there was nothing in them they could not be quickened So the light that was the light that came forth on the earth quen the life that was in the seed and that seed that were quaking were seeds that were for ordained by God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Those seeds were for ordained by God. Listen brother said listen. He said he said oh my he said the predestinated one of course like the seeds laid upon the earth. The predestinated one are like the seed that lay in the earth. He said the one that had life in them, many of them were dead. They were just rotten seas, the water and things burned up. But you know there was a sea laying there ready to life. God know it was laying there. He said now as the sun was sent across the earth not to bring rocks which was dead also to life. It was not only to bring all the dead to life but was to bring the part of the dead which was closed around it. Listen very keenly. He said not all men will receive Christ. No. He said but those which God for ordeain to life is house around some sort of death of the earth. Listen very care. So God in the beginning when God spoke his word the predestinated sea in the dust of the earth was quaking to life. And brother Brown said those seas were seas that God for ordeain to life. And he said listen not all men will receive Christ. He said but those which go for to life is horse around some depth of the earth. So we are part of the earth. Praise the name of the lord. And he say and the one he comes to quaking they are the ones. So God's light that he that he struck the earth with could not quen all the seas. The seas that were quaking that were seas that were fall or deemed to life by God. And just around said the same thing. Said just like a man, the man is part of the earth. We are part of the earth. And as we hear the word, this same word quicken the seas in God's children who are fall orained to life. &gt;&gt; So if that life is not in you, you cannot be foreign. You cannot be quickened by the spirit of God. Praise the name of the Lord. Listen very keenly. He said, "Listen, Jesus said, he said, verily, verily, I say unto he, you that hear my word and believe on him that sent me have everlasting life and shall not come into this condemnation, but is pass from death unto life." Listen very keenly. He said when he received this Holy Spirit, he said that the dead on Pentecost there were the mechanics, not the d. And now the dynamics are come. He said and when you get a dynamics you have been quaking from mortality to immortality. Listen this mortal born we are living in not all can receive the word only those who go for orde to life. When a word is spoken, that word is the spoken word. That spoken word is the light. And that light that comes, it can only quicken those seeds that are for ordained by God. &gt;&gt; So that that is why not everybody can receive the word. Not everybody receive the word. only God's children who God first saw from the foundation of this world in his mind and he wrote their name on the lamp book of life &gt;&gt; that those who are predestinated will receive the light of God they can be quaking by the word praise the name of the lord &gt;&gt; so say he say when you get the dynamics you have been quaking from mortal to immortality he said it makes your whole body comes subject to the It makes you act different, look different, live different. It will just make you different. &gt;&gt; So when you hear the word of God, you in this mortal body, when you hear the word, the word, the dynamics, the Holy Spirit comes and quicken the life in your mortal body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when your life is quickened by God, what this what the quickening power does to you, B say it makes you are different. It makes you look different. It makes you live different. It makes you act different among your friends. &gt;&gt; That is the quickening power we are talking about. &gt;&gt; The book of Ephesians say, let's read Ephesians uh two. Let's read something in Ephesians chapter 2. Amen. Ephesians chapter 2. The Bible say and you are he quaking who were dead in trespasses and sin. So God quick his children who were dead in trespassing and sin. Go quicken them. If you're not part of the word, you cannot be quickened by God. The word of God is the light of God. You cannot be quickened by that word. Listen very carefully. And you had he quickened who were dead in trespassing and sin. Where he pass according to the cause of this world, according to the prince and power of the earth, the spirit that would now work in the throne of disobedience, among whom also we all had our confiscation in pass in the laws of our flesh. fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others. But God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin have quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved. So when we're dead in sin, following the things of this world, enjoying the pleasure of this world after the loss of the flesh, the loss of the eye and the pr of life, the Bible say God who who has reaching mercy, who foresaw his strength from the foundation of the world, God came and quickened us from the deadness of sin. Amen. Where in trespassing and sin and God came and quicken us and brought us back to this word. That is why when we hear the word soon strike you when you hear the word that is why when the word is being preached and the word is not have impact on you begin to check yourself because all God's sons who God for the foundation of the word when they hear this word the word has impact in your life &gt;&gt; if he coming to church every day and we reading the word and we hearing the preaching and the word cannot have impact into our life then there's something wrong with us. &gt;&gt; There is no child of God when yet this word and cannot respond to the word. &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God, there is something in you that can respond to this word &gt;&gt; because there is a deep in you that responding to that deep core of the word. &gt;&gt; So when God speak his word, he shouldn't be the word and they are quickened by the spoken word. So that quickening power quicken the word in you and make the word alive to you. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen. And brother say you were once dead in sin and trespasses and darkness and he quickened by what? His spirit that raised up Jesus. His spirit that raised up Jesus quicken you. He's going to eat money from the dead. He said, "And if it dwells in your mother body, he said, now watch, it also quaking brings to life makes it subject to the word." &gt;&gt; So if you are the word, the word will always quen God's children. And it's only God's children can respond to you to the word. Church, the quaking power is not hidden somewhere. The quickening power is in you and myself. &gt;&gt; It is not somewhere else. The quickened part is dwelling in you. That is why the Bible said if the spirit that dwell in Jesus dwell in your dwell in you, it shall quicken your mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say if the spirit that dwell in Jesus that quicken from the dead, if that spirit dwells in you, it shall quicken your mortal bodies. Praise the name of the Lord. Brother said now notice we are close. Notice he said listen this little seeds lay in the in the ground. He said now potentially you are resurrected. You are resurrected when you receive the Holy Spirit in you. You are resurrected right then. He say you your body is potentially resurrected. Listen the quickening power comes by the Holy Spirit come the life of the believer. But we receive the Holy Spirit. We are potentially resurrected. You know why? Because just like a man who want to buy bread in the stove. He does not have the bread, but he has the purchasing power of the bread, the money in his hands. So potentially the man has the bread in his hands because he has the purchasing power. So it's the same way if you have gospel in you potentially potentially say you are resurrected also &gt;&gt; because why? You have the quickening power dwelling in your soul. &gt;&gt; Really resurrected he said but also you are potentially the rapture. &gt;&gt; We have to quicken the power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Listen very carefully. Say what the quickening power does. He said but all of a sudden all of a sudden a dynamics comes. He said what did they do? It not only filled their spirit inside, but it quickened their mechanics, their body. Their bodies were quickened. They were no more cowards. They were just right out in the face of the people. That's what a quickening power can do to life of a believer. And Peter spoke, he said, "Yeah, men of Judea." He said, "You that were in Jerusalem, Jesus." When Peter got a quickening power on him on the day of Pentecost, Peter was no more afraid. He said right in the face of the people he said yeah men of Judea you that dwell in Jerusalem said where before the dynamics come they were just mechanics you see he said yeah men that dwell in Jerusalem let this be known unto you and hacking onto my word these are not drones as he supposed he said no this is that was spoken by the prophet Joah that it shall come to pass in the last days I will pour my spirit upon all flesh He says see the dynamics come into the mechanics. Are you getting the word? &gt;&gt; The dynamics come into the mechanics. They wasn't afraid no more. What happened to them? He said it changed them. It quickened them. It make them different. They were changed people &gt;&gt; from there on. It quickened them from their old life of being a coward to like the lion of the tribe of Judah. That is what the quickening power can do in the life of a believer. &gt;&gt; When we receive the quickening power that the word is made alive to us in our life, it take all cowardness from our life. Then we cannot be ashamed of the gospel we are hearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said listen he said he said they absolutely face martyrdom in the dark ages the believer face madom. They were killed they were n on the cross. He said they were crucified up and down. They were burned. They were throw in the lines. Then he said because why? They were no more cowards because they had a quickening power. And then he said death had no victory over them at all. He said why the dynamics was in the mus. Yes sir. It quen their motor bodies. That is why when when Paul got to revelation and he was his life was changed. He received the quaking power. When Paul gathered to death, he said, "Oh death, where is your sting?" He said, "Oh grave, where is your victory?" Because the sting of death, Jesus took the sting of death. &gt;&gt; That is why a believer is no more afraid of death. Death is only a gateway to the soul. &gt;&gt; We are not afraid of death, church. Because why? We have the quickening power living in our mortal bodies. Amen. Praise God. Listen very keenly. He said, "Listen, he said it quickened their language." That's what the Bible said. "And their morts were been quaking. &gt;&gt; Their language was quaking. Their thoughts were quaking. Their spirits were quaking. Their life were quaking &gt;&gt; by the quickening power. They were quaking all together." He said they tried to talk and couldn't talk any more human language. They were so quaking up in the presence of God that they spoke in new tongues and heavenly language &gt;&gt; because why church? They had the quaking power we are talking about church. That is why the word should have impact in life of a believer. If we are coming to church and the word is not having impact in our life then there's something wrong with our Christian experience. The word should have impact in life of the believer. That is why if we hear the word the word comes to correct us. The word that we hear Jesus Christ say he said the word has spoken unto you their life and they are spirit. So the word had to be quicken to believers. That is why church we can't keep solving the problems. The only problem we can do the only thing we can do to find solution to our life is to speak the word. It is the word that bring us together. &gt;&gt; It is the word that solve our problem. If you have a marital problem, it's the word that can solve your problem. &gt;&gt; Because if the word is spoken to you and the word is not working to you, it cannot help you. Church, the pastor cannot even help you. It is the word that can help all of us. &gt;&gt; So if the word is spoken and the word is not working on your life, church, it can never help you. Because church, the pastor is not even speaking his own word. He's speaking the word of the master. &gt;&gt; He's speaking the word of the master. Amen. Brown said the quaking power. He said what what happened? He said their thoughts were quaking. Their spirit were quaking. Their life were quaking. They were quaking all together. Listen church. He said the quaking power wasn't only in their soul but it was all over them. Not only their numbers come in to quaking, but it quakens the mechanic. You see what I mean? They were so quaking till their tones their tongue begin to speak another language. They were so quickened by the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ until they laid their hands. They were so quaking with the quaking power till when they laid their hands on the sick, they got well. It quickened their mortal bodies. They were healed by laying on their hands and the spirit quaking their fellowship together with God. They they also were so quaking into the presence of God until when the person died and their soul had gone off it and call him right back to life. &gt;&gt; The quickening power we are talking about church. &gt;&gt; It is not only in the pastor. &gt;&gt; It is in every church member of church. That is why brother Brown say if you have the quickening power he said if a brother dies in the church or a sister die we can pray with that person and call your soul for eternity and come back to time &gt;&gt; because the power is lie in you &gt;&gt; it's not different person it's in you church &gt;&gt; because the scripture said if the spirit that rest of Jesus from the dead dwells in our malice it can quicken us churchmen It can work quick into us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is what the brother was speaking last week. He talking about local to Jesus. Bre five supernaturals that the five supernatural things that came out of the temple ministry. If you read local to Jesus, he said one brethren talk about preaching to the total loss. No matter what, no matter what, if they hear the word, they cannot repent from the word. Even if the word is preached to them, preach the total loss. That was one thing that came out ministry. Another triple ministry of speaking squ into existence. When brother spoke the word, go to him and he spoke the squirre pass and he spoke the squirrel into existence. But when B Brown went to the life, the house of Sister Hy, right? And it was some of the supernatural events that happened in the woods, in the forest or in the jungle, that word was speaking, it got quaking to sister, right? And when the word was quaking to her, the word became a reality. &gt;&gt; And she said to Barb, said, he said, "What you say is true?" Because the word go quick to her. And when she says true say it right, he said ask what you want and God will give it to you. He said God will give it to you. And she was crying said brother what can I ask for? Bre said oh sister hit it right your parents are all. He said if you speak the word go will change that body and make that young couple again. But say sister hit it right could not speak that word for her parents. He said if she has spoken the word for her parents or parents could get young but they will still get old and die. And she was said, "What can I ask for?" Sister, your sister is scrippled. She have been here for years. He said, "If you speak the word," he said, "God will heal." But he said, "Even if God would have heal of a of of of a situation, she would have said God, she possibly should get crippled one day." But church, when the world got into it, right, &gt;&gt; she spoke for the salvation of her children. Because church is the only thing we can ask for in this life is for our soul salvation. &gt;&gt; Church, if we ask for material things, the material things will finish. &gt;&gt; If we ask for riches, it will finish. &gt;&gt; But if we ask for the soul salvation of our home, of our family, of our children, of our brothers and sisters, it will bring forth food of repentance. Our soul salvation is very important in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; That is why church we need to claim our for the blood and our children must pray that God will open their eyes to the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spoken word to be quickened to us. That is why church I'm tell you people say I'm boing the message. Nobody is boring message. &gt;&gt; Nobody's boing message. Your children are not believers. Your children are unbelievers. &gt;&gt; There is nothing God bing the message. Oh, my child is boing the message. My child is Nobody is boing the message. &gt;&gt; The message must be boring us &gt;&gt; to change our life. &gt;&gt; The message was bing us must receive the word. Your child must receive the word. Your son must receive the word. God doesn't have grandchildren. &gt;&gt; We all know it. God doesn't have grandchildren. &gt;&gt; The word has to be quaking to our sons and daughters. Our children must be quickened by the word. If the word does not have impact on our children, it will do them no good. We want to make our children believer us overnight. Our children are not believers. No, they are struggling because they were born and they met us living on life. They don't even understand it. &gt;&gt; They are forced to come to church. They are forced to sing in the song. &gt;&gt; They are we are constraining them to follow us. We don't some of us don't even want our children to even play church. Let children be children. We try to make children older people. That's why when they come, they get so tired of the church. We have to keep praying for our children until God can open eyes to the word. &gt;&gt; Or as church, they only pleasing us. They only come to church to please us. That is why daddy mama is no more dead. They will start doing what they want to do. &gt;&gt; My child born in me. My child born. No child born in the message. &gt;&gt; They were all born sinners. &gt;&gt; They need to know God for themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen brother said listen. He said quaking your m bodies. They were healed by the laying on the hands. He say and the spirit quaking their fellowship together of God till they also were so quaking into the presence of God until when the person die and their soul had gone off it call him right back to life again. Glory to God. Praise the name of the Lord. Because why the quickening power affect the life of a believer? &gt;&gt; If the quickening power cannot affect our life, where's the we come to church? If this what we are hearing it cannot have impact on us then something wrong with us because church children of God want to hear the word they want to straighten your life up you cannot be a child of God hearing the word and you cannot straighten your life up then there's something wrong with your gene &gt;&gt; there's something wrong with your origin &gt;&gt; any child of God said he said if a man is desiring to straighten his life. He said it's a sign that God is dealing with that person. &gt;&gt; If you if you in this church, if you go home, the spirit of God cannot speak to you. If something is not in you to straighten your life, you have to check your Christian experience. &gt;&gt; All of us here, if we hear the word and the word is not doing something to us because Jesus is working on his church every day of his life, &gt;&gt; he's working on us. He's bringing us to the place of perfection. Church, &gt;&gt; God for 6,000 years has been working on his church. &gt;&gt; That is what we don't understand. Church, look, marriage is not a fairy tale story &gt;&gt; that the king son and the king daughter or the king son somebody live together for the rest of life happily. It's a it's a fairy tale. &gt;&gt; Marriage is a school of character. Every day we learn in our marital life. &gt;&gt; Every day there are things we not our marital life. &gt;&gt; It is not a fairy tale church. We are mistaking the church. It's not a fairy tale. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Listen brother the message. He said on the Easter Sea he said now the Easter Sea. He said now but when they he said now when they they went up to Pentecost he said there they received the quaking power the power that make them alive. He said that all things what does it do to our mortal bodies? Its our opinion it change our notion. It set our affection on things which are above. The quickening power that we are talking about that is in you and myself is set our desire on things above. &gt;&gt; Nothing's here. &gt;&gt; That is what Paul said or the epistle said. He said nothing can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; He said no depth, no height, nor principality, no powers can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; It cannot separate us church. Because why? The word is make alive to us. &gt;&gt; The word is make alive to us. &gt;&gt; Rean said listen. He said and you are quaking and this quaking power brings a body into a rapture condition. &gt;&gt; Church. The quickening power &gt;&gt; can bring a believer body into a rapture condition. That means potentially &gt;&gt; you are raptured already. &gt;&gt; We are only waiting for a transformation of our bodies. &gt;&gt; But potentially we are raptured. &gt;&gt; We are in a rapturing state. Church &gt;&gt; potentially. We are raptured. Listen very keenly. I like this. He said, "And you are quaking and death quaking in power brings your body into a rapture condition already." &gt;&gt; So potentially we all raptured. &gt;&gt; That is why church one day we'll be walking we receive our translation because we are rapture already church. I'm not telling you a story. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you a reality. Re notice the Pentecostal people up there when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit. Listen to me. When those Pentecostal group group up there on the day of Pentecost receive their abstract deeds from God. When you get a quickening power, you receive your abstract title deeds. Abstract mean you cannot see it but you possess it. You you we we we cannot live honor privileged life as Christian. You have your a DS you can tell the devil to leave this place because you own it. &gt;&gt; It's for you. &gt;&gt; You're a every promise of the word God gave it to us for our possession. Everything that God say in this world say our pro our problem is we are living honor privileged life &gt;&gt; we don't even know who we are you do one thing you come out of square one today Christian tomorrow you believer today you ready for rapture tomorrow you not ready for the rapture no every day see yourself as a conqueror as a victor &gt;&gt; don't see yourself as are defeated &gt;&gt; every day of your life. See yourself as your victor, &gt;&gt; as your conqueror. &gt;&gt; We are not defeated, church. &gt;&gt; You are a child of God. Tell I'm a child of the king. &gt;&gt; You have the gene of God in you, church. &gt;&gt; You have the quickening power in you, church. If the spirit that dwell in Christ dwells in you, it shall quicken your mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; That power is in you, church. Don't look for that power anywhere. It's really in you myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so quaking their bodies till they couldn't even speak in the language anymore. It quickened their body to a heavenly language and in the place they were going to quickening power of God shook their mortal body. So their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into immortal language. What a quickening power. What something that belongs? He said, "If the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal body, it shall also quicken them by the power of the living God." &gt;&gt; That is why said when Elisha the prophet died, he said is the both of him is still had a quaking power. &gt;&gt; Church, death can change us. &gt;&gt; We're all redeemed by God already. Elisha the prophet the power we are talking about it was in his bone his bone the power was in it was stay in it &gt;&gt; that is why when Israel when they talk of man and they throw a man on the bones of Elisha they make him back to life &gt;&gt; they make him back to life I'm not talking about different person I'm talking about you church &gt;&gt; you what I said here I'm talking about I'm talking to you. I'm not talking about a different person. I'm talking to you. You have that power. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a different person. I'm talking about you. Jesus Bre said when Jesus want to go man the battle of win the battle of the mind. He f my law if it's away. He said let it pass over me. But God cannot die. God have to leave the body for the body to die because God cannot die. So when Jesus went to Calvary, he died. Rebrand say his soul went to hell. &gt;&gt; His spirit went to God. &gt;&gt; His body was in the grave. &gt;&gt; But Jesus was the originator of the quickening power. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus had to conquer death, hell, principality and power &gt;&gt; to prove to us that the power is in him. It's in us &gt;&gt; because God brought to understand that when Jesus died, &gt;&gt; the brow of Christ was in Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're in Jesus. &gt;&gt; We're in Jesus. So if Jesus will resurrect will resurrect, the bride of Christ will have to be resurrected &gt;&gt; because you are part of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Church, you don't believe it. Listen, I listen it to you. I read from this message. Let me just read it so you see what I'm talking about. You find this in the message in two men said listen. He said, "Yeah, he goes." Why did he leave then? He left. The Bible said he has sinned. He went and preached to souls that were in prison and repented not in the long suffering days of Noah. His soul and spirit his steop of his own being went down. He said let's follow him a little bit. We like to tonight to follow me a few minutes. Let's see where he went. Just below the region of motor veins laid realms of demons. Amen. Church, we are fighting a battle. Amen. Just below the region of mine, there are demons power that exist. Amen. If you don't believe demon powers, there are demon powers existing. There is a living devil. There's a living devil we are fighting. In fact, we are fighting an enemy that we cannot see. You cannot see your enemy. But we use the word to conquer the enemy &gt;&gt; if the word is spoken to us. Reb being lays the realms of demons power. Below just above there lays the souls of the unjust. Below lays the very domain of Satan hell. Then just above us lay the Holy Spirit. And on the altar under the altar lays the souls of the of the just man. The next is God himself. He said on going down and going upward. The two spirits are here on earth influencing the people of the earth. That's where influence everybody. The spirit of God and the spirit of the devil influence people on the earth. If you go down demons power, the religion of the just, the region of the unjust and sat on hell. But Jesus when he died, listen, when Jesus died, he went to the downward path because why Jesus took the sins of this world. So Jesus had to go to hell, the downward path. And when Jesus went down, he passed beyond the the the region of demon power. He passed beyond the region of the souls of the unjust. That when somebody's die on earth, Brown say if someone dies and they didn't give life to Christ. If someone die, they go into the region of the unjust. That's what he said. He said from there you see go to hell. But say it's not a place to go. He say if someone goes to hell, it's like taking a hot iron. in prison you put into a fire is hot and you pass it through the person ears say it will be more comfort to you to enjoy a hot anger passing through your ears than to go the downward path so that mean it's not a place to go it was meant for the devil his angel amen so Jesus went the downward path he went to the region of the unjust and Jesus went there and he knocked the door to the sodon jaws and open the door and he said, "I was the one that Noah spoke of. I was the one that Abraham spoke of. I was the one the prophet spoke of &gt;&gt; but they could not hear his word." &gt;&gt; That is why church when they get to realize it was a messiah because what came out of the temple was preaching to the unjust. So they could never be saved. Sorry to say. And Jesus reminded them of his own word that I am the fulfillment of the virgin birth. I am the sea of the woman. And he went on just and he told him I am here fulfilling his own promises by the word. &gt;&gt; Jesus went a downward path but because they could not be redeemed that door was shut. It was still there. The problem said Jesus went down to hell and went to meet the devil in hell. When Satan saw him, he said Satan said, "Oh, you are here." He said, "Yes, I'm here." He said, "But I told I say Satan has been trying to destroy that sea long time. &gt;&gt; He has been playing to destroy the promised sea. So he said I told him I better kill you. I told I prophet I kill you. &gt;&gt; But that was the king of glory sitting right in the presence of the devil. &gt;&gt; And said read the story. Bre said and Jesus was the boss in hell. &gt;&gt; I want you to read that. &gt;&gt; He said he was the boss. I want you to I want to read that. Listen. &gt;&gt; Listen. You see when the that sea was promised in the garden of Eden, the devil has constantly tried to destroy that sea and the death of Abra and the coming of said was just a death burial and resurrection of Christ. That sea must continue and he tried to destroy it. He said I thought I you when I destroyed I thought I you when I destroy the prophets. I was positive how you when I beheaded John. Satan was be constantly after that seed of the woman that one day was coming. So he was killing the people. They believe that line Satan was killing him. He said but now after all you have arrived Satan that is in hell. &gt;&gt; Then he said I've got you now. I can hear him say Satan come here. &gt;&gt; He is the boss now. the master, &gt;&gt; the one who has the quickening power. &gt;&gt; He was not in hell. And said he he is the boss now in hell. He said, "Here's the boss." Richard what? Grab the keys of death and hell. &gt;&gt; He went to Satan and he said, "Satan, give me the keys of death and hell." &gt;&gt; Give me the keys of death and hell. And Jesus took the key, kept set of the keys in there in hell &gt;&gt; and took it and hanging on his side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he didn't stop there. When he took the keys of Satan said what he did, he step in hell more &gt;&gt; and smash the door. Hell &gt;&gt; Satan has been shut up. &gt;&gt; Smash the door. Took the keys. &gt;&gt; Listen. He reached out and grabbed the keys of death and hell off his side, hung it on his own side and he told I want to self notice on you. You are being a bluff roll enough be bluffing us. &gt;&gt; When the child see his elder brother and beating that child when the child see his brother child to have frisky tell I can beat you because why brother is there. So the child be playing frisky. Jesus save Satan notice in hell. He said notice Jesus have noticed you have been a blood fire alone. Jesus told said I am the vible son of the living God. My blood is still on the cross &gt;&gt; and the full debt of sin has been paid church. Then he said, "You have no right no more. &gt;&gt; You are scraped." &gt;&gt; He said, "Get me those keys." &gt;&gt; He turned around and gave him a healthy key. &gt;&gt; Jesus took the key. &gt;&gt; The keys of death and hell. He took a guess to kick kick Satan. &gt;&gt; Not only kick but smash the door hell. and light the devil up. &gt;&gt; Listen, good healthy key and slam the door together and say stay in there. I am your boss from now on. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the boss. &gt;&gt; He's the boss. &gt;&gt; Even hell, Jesus is the boss. &gt;&gt; Church, don't you see? You are on the winning side. You have the power in you. &gt;&gt; You are on the winning side. &gt;&gt; Script Satan of his of the keys or death and hell. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the boss. &gt;&gt; We are on the boss side. The boss. &gt;&gt; Re says Satan is just a bluff. He has no He has nothing. He's just a bluff. This is where we end with this story. When Jesus took the keys, he say that to I'm your boss from now on. Now he didn't have the keys to the kingdom cuz he gave the key of the kingdom to Peter, right? to the church &gt;&gt; that once we b heaven &gt;&gt; but now he took another key from Satan the keys of death and hell &gt;&gt; church you have the power in you listen to me &gt;&gt; he has the keys in your hands you told the keys the key of heaven hell when Jesus went he have that key because he has to go to paradise to all the old testament sins that die. So Jesus took the keys and get out from hell and went into the realms of paradise where paradise was a place on earth in another dimension but the bl of boo and gold could not protect them. That's what demon power could penetrate the entire invoke the spirit of Samuel. &gt;&gt; But Jesus to Satan is a man blood is still on the cross. There's only a paradise now. We don't have paradise now. No. &gt;&gt; So Jesus went to paradise and knocked the door of paradise. Hook him up. Abraham Sarah came. &gt;&gt; Who is knocking the door and start opening it? And Abra who is there? Abra said come come. He said this is the one that gave us the promise seed. &gt;&gt; Job came to the door to spot. He said oh my redeemer live. &gt;&gt; My redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; Now he said those skin in this body yet in my flesh I shall see thy God. &gt;&gt; All the old testament sins Jesus open Eve all of them Adam all the old testament sins were there in paradise. And Jesus opened the door of paradise and said come with me and start walking. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say graves were open &gt;&gt; because why the originator of the quickening power &gt;&gt; has come to conquer death, hell, principality and powers. &gt;&gt; He has a power in him. all the Old Testament saints being the one with Jesus &gt;&gt; and Abra and the rest of the of of the Old Testament sings they say want to see in the city of Jerusalem 40 days they were appearing and disappearing 40 days and Jesus told him I have to go and see my disciples to tell them I'm alive because I have to give them the sink quaking power to be in them. I'm alive. What the disciple told him? He said, "You have to go Jerusalem to receive the power from on high." And Jesus from there took the Old Testament sings to glory because they have to go and stay in the region of the just. And when the Old Testament sings, one of the angels shout, he said, "Open ye the doors, ye everlasting doors, and the king of glory shall come in." &gt;&gt; And one of the angels shout said, "Who is the king of glory?" &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle is the king of glory." &gt;&gt; Because the king of glory has con everything powers. He had the quickening power. &gt;&gt; Reban said, "Listen, just I can see Daniel look over his shoulder and say, "This is the rock that was here on the mountain just as I'm standing here." I see Jo said, "This is my redeemer." I say, "I knew that live." And someday he will still upon the earth. Bamb may not be but a little small of arches but in 15 minutes from now I will be in again. Ezekiel over in the top and said I seen the same person as a we in the middle of the we went up in the middle of the air he said I saw him coming with 10,000 of his sins &gt;&gt; all the old testament sins &gt;&gt; there was old testament sins waiting they were only the at blood they could not go in the presence of god of heaven because of goat and sheep blood could not take away sin at that time but when Jesus resurrected The Bible said many of the sins that slept in the dust of the earth rose and come out of the grave &gt;&gt; because the originator of the quickening power &gt;&gt; has taken all the Old Testament things out. Church, the scripture said if the spirit that raised Jesus from the death dwells in you, it shall quicken your mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; That power is in you, church. &gt;&gt; Don't look different place. It's in you church. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to think about different place. It's in you right now. As I speak, &gt;&gt; if the rapture take place right now, &gt;&gt; many of us shall be translated be changed. Because the power is in us. They put in power. It's in our body. Church. The Bible say the spirit that was in Christ be in you. It shall quicken your morties. We are sons and daughters of God. Amen. Rebran say he say and they appear to many. that wasn't of it is appear to many. And all of the homeland praise the name of the Lord. Brother say he said oh God as these hands go up and the music is sweetly echoing back down the road as you have passed from death unto life that has said he that hear my word and believe on him that sent me everlasting life. He has passed from death unto life because you became death that we must be life through your resurrection. You made little Lord the angels come down to be a man come out of the great deal of famine from beyond that was made flesh and have blood and will share that blood that he might make a way of escape for all of us. They not only did it, he said, "But you prove it." Infallibility by raising from the dead and raising the dead when you were here on earth. Not only that, but you gave, you have made a dual proof of his word you did to Abraham. Not beside that, you sent back the Holy Spirit as a witness. &gt;&gt; He said quicken to a church. That's what the church has been quickened. Church, there's no fear when Christ come. You are part of the rapture. You're part of the bride. &gt;&gt; Forget your mistakes. &gt;&gt; Forget your shortcomings. You are a rapturing candidate. &gt;&gt; Forget about your shortcomings. Forget your mistake. I did that one. Satan pointing you to that one. Oh, you did this one. You did that one. The Bible says Satan is the accuser of our breeding. Satan will always point you to your shortcoming, but he'll never point you to your successful life. &gt;&gt; He never pointed you to your successful life. Say what?
