[41:08] Saints I was glad when they said unto me
[41:10] let us go to the house of the
[41:13] Lord yes it's not an easy thing go to
[41:17] work I know some of you are coming from
[41:18] work and you have to come here and some
[41:21] are going to work and you have to come
[41:24] here before you go it's not an easy
[41:26] task but you
[41:28] know when you have a little bit of God
[41:31] in
[41:33] you it is not a
[41:37] burden it's just a love
[41:40] affair it is the love of God in you that
[41:44] is driving
[41:45] you sometimes you are so tired you want
[41:47] to rest you are so tired on your way
[41:51] home you tell yourself today I have a
[41:53] good reason not to go to church
[41:56] but then as soon as it's
[41:59] time you don't know what even gets you
[42:02] ready it is the grace of God and uh I
[42:06] just want to uh thank the almighty God
[42:09] for his grace yes uh brother Emmanuel I
[42:12] think today is probably the the last day
[42:15] we'll be seeing you for this time you
[42:17] are living on on Friday yes um the Lord
[42:21] bless you it was it was very nice you
[42:25] know having this time fellowship with
[42:27] you and your wife I know you are going
[42:29] should be here for a little while um and
[42:32] may the Lord carry you safely yes we
[42:35] we'll definitely miss you praise the
[42:37] Lord praise God
[42:44] yes a child of
[42:48] God just know one thing for
[42:52] sure that you will never get lost
[42:58] I don't know either here or somebody
[43:00] online but you will never get
[43:06] lost I remember in the village where I
[43:09] was growing up it was a place people
[43:12] used to hunt a
[43:14] lot and it didn't happen very often but
[43:19] once in a while a hunter goes hunting
[43:23] and then he doesn't come back by there I
[43:25] mean they hunting the Night by day break
[43:27] they expect him to be home and he's not
[43:30] there and they summon men to go to the
[43:35] bush to go and find him they don't know
[43:39] where he
[43:41] went and there are no cell
[43:44] phones and even if there were cell
[43:46] phones in those days why in the bush
[43:49] would you get
[43:50] coverage and then the men will
[43:53] go whether dead or alive
[43:56] they will bring that person back
[43:59] home and I started thinking about it how
[44:02] many times in our personal lives have we
[44:06] taken the wrong
[44:09] turn that you get to a junction in your
[44:12] life and then you make a wrong
[44:16] turn it is not an indication that you
[44:19] are
[44:20] lost there is hope for the
[44:25] living
[44:27] some Hunters
[44:29] go they were born and bred in the same
[44:31] Village and they know the bushes very
[44:33] well and this happened to the prophet of
[44:35] God anyway and then they get lost in the
[44:38] bush and then they will go round and
[44:40] round and round and before they away
[44:41] they are back to the same
[44:44] place and then they keep trying and keep
[44:48] trying and keep trying and then they
[44:50] make the last turn and then they keep
[44:53] going and then they realize that all of
[44:55] a sudden oh that is the city on top of
[44:58] the hill there and even though they have
[45:00] not arrived but seeing the city a far
[45:03] off gives them the hope that I am
[45:06] already home praise be to God it doesn't
[45:10] matter how many tweets and how many
[45:11] tense you have made in this life it
[45:13] doesn't matter how many wrong choices
[45:15] you have made it doesn't matter how many
[45:17] wrong tense you have made but we have
[45:20] taken the final turn praise be to
[45:23] God we are on the home run
[45:26] amen and we are seeing the city on the
[45:29] hill by eyes of
[45:31] faith and even though we have not
[45:33] reached yet the Bible says that we are
[45:37] already seated in Heavenly places
[45:38] through Christ Jesus we are there
[45:41] already praise
[45:44] God a child of God would never get
[45:48] lost praise God what are we talking
[45:51] about
[45:52] tonight either last week or somewhere
[45:55] last week two weeks I was reading
[45:58] actually it was in The Book of
[46:01] Daniel and when I don't know I either
[46:04] chapter I mean one of the
[46:06] chapters excuse me when I finished
[46:10] reading and I was just going on my
[46:13] knees something just jumped to
[46:17] me now a lot of things jump to me and
[46:21] then they
[46:23] go but this one that came to me
[46:26] has come to
[46:28] stay praise be to
[46:31] God even in my death
[46:34] bed before I take my last breath that
[46:38] picture is going to be before
[46:40] me and that is what we are going to talk
[46:42] about
[46:47] tonight praise the Lord can we please
[46:50] stand and then take our
[46:54] Bibles open to Ephesians
[46:59] 2 Ephesians 2 we are reading from 4 to
[47:12] 8 Ephesians 2:4
[47:16] to8 but God who is rich in
[47:21] Mercy for his great love where with he
[47:26] loved us I see people are flipping their
[47:28] pages is everybody there praise God I
[47:31] take it
[47:34] again but God who is rich in
[47:37] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[47:41] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[47:46] have quickened
[47:47] us together with
[47:50] Christ by grace are ye
[47:53] saved and have raised us up
[47:56] together and made us sit together in
[47:59] Heavenly places in Christ
[48:02] Jesus that in the ages to come he might
[48:06] sheld the exceeding Riches of his
[48:10] grace in his kindness towards us through
[48:14] Christ
[48:16] Jesus for by grace are you saved through
[48:19] faith and that not of your works it is
[48:23] the gift of God
[48:26] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[48:29] reading of his word praise God shall we
[48:31] be
[48:35] seated what jumped to me that day is the
[48:40] fif man on the
[48:44] cross what I was reading had nothing to
[48:47] do with
[48:49] this and just from
[48:52] nowhere it just hit me the fifth man on
[48:58] the
[49:00] cross and that went deep into my
[49:04] soul praise be to
[49:08] God and I am feeding on it every inch
[49:11] along the
[49:13] way praise the
[49:15] Lord it wasn't something I just read or
[49:19] something I thought
[49:21] of it just came the fifth man
[49:26] on the
[49:31] cross now after the
[49:35] fall things were never the same
[49:41] again everything
[49:44] changed concerning God's order of
[49:49] procreation Adam was supposed to
[49:52] speak the children into existence
[49:57] but because of the
[49:59] Fall instead of God's perfect
[50:02] will we now had the permissive will of
[50:05] God regarding
[50:09] procreation that it had to take a man
[50:12] and a woman to bring forth
[50:15] children but that was not God's perfect
[50:19] will that was his permissive
[50:22] will and that was the order
[50:26] now when you look at
[50:30] this that every
[50:33] man now let me set the record
[50:37] straight the fifth man on the cross I am
[50:39] not leaving the sisters
[50:44] out because I thought of it I said
[50:47] instead of a fif man on the cross why
[50:49] don't I say the fifth person on the
[50:52] cross so the sisters will feel included
[50:58] praise the
[50:59] Lord but then the way it came to me I
[51:03] said I want to just put it out that way
[51:05] and a voice said maybe you are leaving
[51:07] the sisters
[51:08] out we are not leaving the sisters out
[51:12] the Bible says
[51:13] that he came to his own and his own
[51:17] received him not but to as many as
[51:20] received him he gave them the power to
[51:23] be called what sons of God
[51:28] and are there Daughters of God
[51:33] yes he gave them power to be called sons
[51:36] of God he was not leaving out the
[51:39] daughters so we are not leaving out the
[51:42] daughters we are not leaving out the
[51:44] sisters we are all a part of this
[51:47] journey and now when we talk of the
[51:49] bride of Christ a bride has to be a lady
[51:54] right and here I am amen I a bride of
[52:00] Christ
[52:02] so I hope you are getting the picture
[52:05] very good so don't say because it's
[52:09] titled the fifth man on the cross the
[52:11] sisters are left out nobody is left out
[52:14] praise the
[52:19] Lord so every man and for that matter
[52:22] every woman that was born was born into
[52:25] sinful
[52:26] flesh we sin by
[52:28] representation because Adam sin Adam and
[52:31] Eve
[52:32] fell so we were born straight into the
[52:37] devil's pawn
[52:41] shop and for those of you who are
[52:44] conversent with the porn
[52:46] shop when you carry anything to the pawn
[52:50] shop whether a jewelry whether whatever
[52:54] it is and you carry it there the
[52:57] operator will take it and then they'll
[53:00] give you some money in
[53:02] return that thing you carry there
[53:04] doesn't belong to
[53:06] them but then because they have given
[53:09] you money towards it there is no way you
[53:12] can walk in there and claim
[53:17] it you would have to pay the ransome to
[53:20] be able to take back that which belongs
[53:23] to you
[53:27] so every man that was born was born
[53:29] straight into the devil's pawn
[53:32] shop and there we were
[53:35] sitting who was going to pay the
[53:41] ransom no
[53:43] wonder John on the island of
[53:47] Patmos when he saw that there was no one
[53:50] wory to take the book and to open the
[53:53] seals thereof he started crying
[53:56] but there was hope when he saw right in
[54:00] the midst of the Throne of God that
[54:02] Bloody
[54:05] lamp came there was hope and all
[54:10] Humanity was waiting for that
[54:15] moment praise be to
[54:18] God all Humanity was waiting for that
[54:22] even though his coming was long
[54:26] prophesied and the people were expecting
[54:29] his coming yet when he
[54:31] came they didn't realize it they lost
[54:36] it because in their mind they had a
[54:40] picture of how he was going to
[54:43] come and then he came in a way they
[54:47] never
[54:48] expected and they called him
[54:51] names they stood against
[54:54] him
[54:56] but there was no
[54:58] obstacle that could stop him from doing
[55:02] the will of the
[55:03] father he came for a
[55:06] purpose and there was nothing that was
[55:08] going to stop him with all the
[55:11] opposition all the obstacles all the
[55:13] name calling nothing was going to stop
[55:18] him if you are a child of God at work or
[55:21] in your neighborhood you may be
[55:23] surrounded by people that will strongly
[55:26] oppose you in everything but you know
[55:29] what you need
[55:32] them you probably need them more than
[55:35] they need
[55:36] you that no they give me headache at
[55:39] work they give me too much work they
[55:42] call me names they are always on my case
[55:46] yes and you need them God placed you
[55:50] there for a
[55:52] cause they are there to bring something
[55:55] in you
[55:58] out and the sooner you embrace
[56:01] it the better it will be for
[56:06] you you should be happy it's not an easy
[56:10] thing on several occasions my previous
[56:14] manager will used to sit down and have a
[56:16] very long
[56:18] conversation and sometimes I would think
[56:21] after that he wouldn't talk to me again
[56:23] but he was very nice
[56:25] praise the
[56:28] Lord but you need
[56:31] them God will use them to cut you to
[56:35] shape praise the Lord there was no
[56:38] obstacle that could stop
[56:43] him he had to fulfill the purpose of his
[56:47] coming praise the
[56:49] Lord now when his time on Earth had was
[56:53] coming to an end
[56:56] he was
[56:59] examined the purpose of which he
[57:02] came now the time was coming praise the
[57:06] Lord he was being
[57:10] examined the Bible says at the mouth of
[57:14] two or three Witnesses let every word be
[57:18] established pilate
[57:21] said this man you guys are accusing I
[57:24] found had no fault in him he was
[57:29] blameless even Judas is
[57:32] scariot after betraying him for 30
[57:35] pieces of silver he said I have I have I
[57:39] have I betrayed an innocent
[57:43] blood his own
[57:49] confession he was without
[57:52] guilt he didn't commit
[57:55] any
[57:56] crime there was nothing they could
[57:58] impute on him they couldn't find any
[58:02] cause against him and yet he was found
[58:09] guilty it doesn't happen in the court of
[58:13] law in the court of law you are presumed
[58:18] innocent until proven
[58:22] guilty but in his case
[58:25] he was found
[58:28] guilty before the case even
[58:33] started we are talking about the fifth
[58:38] man on the cross praise the
[58:43] Lord in the
[58:46] message earnestly contending for the
[58:49] faith that was once delivered to the
[58:50] Saints
[58:53] 1953
[58:55] the prayer of God says and look some
[58:59] people only see three crosses at
[59:04] goata there were
[59:08] four there was a thief on one
[59:12] side a thief on the other
[59:15] side Jesus in the
[59:18] middle and cursed is he that HTH on a
[59:23] tree Jesus was made a
[59:27] cast for us hanging on a
[59:31] tree and Judas hang himself on a Sy tree
[59:37] just as much cross as the rest of them
[59:41] there were four
[59:44] crosses the two thieves and the Lord
[59:48] Jesus and there was a fourth cross for
[59:52] Judas Iscariot
[59:55] praise the
[59:57] Lord
[1:00:01] now on the fourth
[1:00:06] cross Judas betrayed the
[1:00:09] Lord and he hanged himself as a
[1:00:14] result the two thevs committed crimes
[1:00:17] and they were found guilty to
[1:00:20] die but here was an innocent man
[1:00:25] who didn't have to be
[1:00:28] there he didn't have to be
[1:00:31] there because he did not commit any
[1:00:35] crime he did not do anything
[1:00:38] evil he did not cver anybody's
[1:00:42] property but here he
[1:00:50] was there and he was there for a friend
[1:00:58] the
[1:00:59] just representing the
[1:01:02] unjust the righteous for the
[1:01:08] unrighteous he was there not for
[1:01:12] himself he was there for
[1:01:17] somebody pilot said he didn't find any
[1:01:19] fault in
[1:01:22] him and yet he was found
[1:01:26] guilty
[1:01:30] now in the
[1:01:32] message Christ is revealed in his own
[1:01:37] word the prophet of God said
[1:01:41] now the same thing is
[1:01:44] this if you are a son of
[1:01:48] God and if I am a Son of God or a
[1:01:51] daughter of
[1:01:52] God we were in God at the
[1:01:56] beginning and when Jesus came the
[1:01:58] fullness of the word then we were in him
[1:02:03] gem
[1:02:04] form when he was
[1:02:06] crucified we were crucified in his body
[1:02:11] when he rose from the dead we rose with
[1:02:16] him
[1:02:18] 1965 the message things that are to
[1:02:22] be the pray of God says and I am a
[1:02:25] believer and now we are
[1:02:28] assembled we've just been
[1:02:31] taught that we were in
[1:02:34] Christ when he walked on
[1:02:37] Earth for we are part of his
[1:02:41] word he suffered we suffered with
[1:02:45] him we bled with him we died with
[1:02:50] him we was buried with him
[1:02:55] we are risen with
[1:02:57] him and we are setting together in
[1:03:00] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:03:02] Jesus praise the
[1:03:04] Lord so when he hang on the
[1:03:09] cross he carried someone with
[1:03:14] him praise the
[1:03:16] Lord there were four
[1:03:20] crosses there were four crosses

[1:03:32] Judas but there were five
[1:03:37] people here is where I want you to

[1:03:49] don't want to get ahead of
[1:03:51] myself praise the Lord so as he hang on

[1:03:57] cross he carried someone with him there
[1:04:01] was a fifth man hanging with him on the
[1:04:07] cross the fif man couldn't die on his
[1:04:11] own
[1:04:14] cross because he was meant to live and
[1:04:18] not
[1:04:19] die praise the
[1:04:21] Lord dying on his own cross would mean a
[1:04:25] oneway ticket to
[1:04:27] Hell the fif man was going to have his
[1:04:30] moment to carry his
[1:04:33] cross the Lord Jesus said If any man
[1:04:36] comes after me let him take up his cross
[1:04:39] let him deny himself daily take up his
[1:04:42] cross and follow
[1:04:44] me so there was he was going to have his
[1:04:49] moment but on the spare of that moment
[1:04:52] on that great occasion
[1:04:57] he was being
[1:04:59] hidden praise be to God because there
[1:05:03] was a friend that had come on the
[1:05:05] scene to take on that
[1:05:08] judgment a judgment he couldn't
[1:05:11] take there was a friend that had come on
[1:05:14] the scene to pay that debt a debt he
[1:05:18] didn't
[1:05:19] owe that friend had
[1:05:22] come is just like committing a crime and
[1:05:26] then going to the court and then you
[1:05:28] take a lawyer you'll be sitting there
[1:05:31] you don't have to speak when they call
[1:05:33] your name is the lawyer that shows
[1:05:37] up he does all the Talking praise the
[1:05:42] Lord the fifth
[1:05:44] man praise be to
[1:05:47] God the fifth man was going to have his
[1:05:49] woman to carry his own cross If any man
[1:05:52] comes after me let him deny himself
[1:05:54] himself take up his cross daily and
[1:05:56] follow me so his moment was coming but
[1:06:00] not on that great occasion you and I
[1:06:06] have a cross to
[1:06:08] carry and this cross we are carrying is
[1:06:12] an
[1:06:14] appreciation to that cross he
[1:06:19] cared praise be to God it only makes us
[1:06:24] partakers of his suffering of his Agony
[1:06:27] his persecution his rejection his
[1:06:33] dejection praise be to
[1:06:39] God and
[1:06:43] remember that
[1:06:45] salvation is not of
[1:06:48] works for by
[1:06:52] grace are we is
[1:06:57] saved through
[1:07:00] faith so we are riding on this grace to
[1:07:05] glory is what the grace of God has done
[1:07:08] for us that is what we are depending on
[1:07:12] that is what has brought us this far and
[1:07:14] that is what is going to see us through
[1:07:16] there is no doubt
[1:07:18] whatever now we are talking about the
[1:07:23] fifth man
[1:07:26] on the
[1:07:29] cross and I'm saying just personalize
[1:07:33] it I am the fifth man on the
[1:07:36] cross you are the fifth the fifth sister
[1:07:40] on the cross you are the fifth brother
[1:07:43] on the
[1:07:46] cross I am the fifth man on the
[1:07:50] cross now the prophet of God said five
[1:07:55] is the number of Grace I mean yes five
[1:07:58] is the number of
[1:08:00] Grace there are seven
[1:08:02] dimensions The Fifth
[1:08:05] Dimension is where every sinner
[1:08:08] goes when they
[1:08:22] die
[1:10:22] praise the Lord all right good we are
[1:10:26] good so we don't even need bares
[1:10:30] anymore praise the
[1:10:32] Lord so the The Fifth Dimension is where
[1:10:36] unrepented souls go when they die now
[1:10:39] and we are talking about the
[1:10:42] fifth man on the cross now what would
[1:10:46] ever make this
[1:10:49] possible the only thing that could take
[1:10:53] the fifth man from The Fifth Dimension
[1:10:56] was nothing but the grace of God praise
[1:11:00] the Lord for the wages of sin is death
[1:11:04] and all we were good for was to just
[1:11:07] come live die and go to
[1:11:10] hell but it took the grace of God and it
[1:11:14] will take nothing but the grace of
[1:11:17] God to overend the
[1:11:22] table
[1:11:30] Christ was crucified
[1:11:36] once and we were crucified with
[1:11:40] him we were in him when he was crucified
[1:11:44] on the
[1:11:47] cross and this is where we ought to be
[1:11:51] very very very careful
[1:11:55] because you were in him when he was
[1:11:59] crucified if you should do anything
[1:12:03] contrary to his
[1:12:06] word you are crucifying him
[1:12:09] again you are crucifying him AR
[1:12:14] fresh why because you were in that
[1:12:18] body when he hang on the
[1:12:22] cross he was crucified
[1:12:26] once not twice
[1:12:31] once
[1:12:32] now look at
[1:12:36] Moses when God told
[1:12:39] Moses to speak to the rock that The Rock
[1:12:43] oh I forgotten myself that The Rock will
[1:12:46] bring forth
[1:12:47] water Moses out of anger struck the rock
[1:12:51] not once but twice
[1:12:54] and called the children of God
[1:12:56] Rebels and God was not
[1:12:59] happy with
[1:13:02] Moses to the extent that God told Moses
[1:13:05] your eyes will see the promised land but
[1:13:08] your foot would not set
[1:13:11] there the prophet of God said that what
[1:13:14] Moses did he broke the scriptures he
[1:13:17] broke the that perfect picture God had
[1:13:20] because the rock that followed them in
[1:13:22] the wilderness was Christ and he was
[1:13:25] supposed to be smitten once and not
[1:13:27] twice and Moses smot it
[1:13:31] twice and the prophet of God said by
[1:13:35] that act he
[1:13:38] broke that picture that they broke
[1:13:41] scriptures God was not happy with
[1:13:45] him and to tell
[1:13:48] you what God would
[1:13:52] do
[1:13:54] smiting him the second time I know we
[1:13:58] can look at our lives and we can count
[1:14:01] some of us can
[1:14:03] count some of us have lost
[1:14:06] count of how many
[1:14:08] times we have crucified him over and
[1:14:14] over when does it
[1:14:18] stop when does it come to an
[1:14:22] end
[1:14:29] today if you hear his voice Harding not
[1:14:31] your
[1:14:37] heart it must
[1:14:42] stop I used to tell Dan and
[1:14:45] Joshua I said
[1:14:48] look if you are holding
[1:14:51] drug and you say I am going to take this
[1:14:54] for the last time I say it shows you
[1:14:57] going to take it
[1:15:01] again I said but if you say for the
[1:15:04] first time I am not going to take
[1:15:08] this I say it shows you are on your way
[1:15:11] to
[1:15:14] Deliverance whatever you are
[1:15:17] doing that you know in your heart is not
[1:15:20] right with the word of God that you know
[1:15:24] that by that act you are crucifying him
[1:15:26] again or the second time or you are
[1:15:29] crucifying him
[1:15:31] aresh it's
[1:15:34] time to call it a
[1:15:37] quit and seek the face of God with all
[1:15:42] endlessness and ask for
[1:15:48] forgiveness he was crucified on the
[1:15:51] cross we were in him
[1:15:53] we died with him we were buried with him
[1:15:57] and we rose with him and we are seated
[1:16:00] in Heavenly places through Christ
[1:16:03] Jesus praise the
[1:16:07] lord we are not
[1:16:12] defeated we are on the winning
[1:16:15] side I don't care whatever
[1:16:18] happens praise be to God I know when he
[1:16:22] was on the cross I was with him praise
[1:16:25] be to God my life would never be the
[1:16:28] same again oh praise God I have probably
[1:16:33] said it a thousand
[1:16:35] times and I'm going to add it again a,1
[1:16:39] times that there are not enough demons
[1:16:43] in hell because my soul has found his Ty
[1:16:49] poost praise the Lord there are no not
[1:16:53] enough demons in
[1:16:55] hell that can change the
[1:16:59] picture praise be to God there are not
[1:17:03] enough
[1:17:04] demons praise God I don't
[1:17:08] care if they ever cut my head and they
[1:17:11] carry somewhere and they take the leg
[1:17:13] somewhere it doesn't make any
[1:17:16] difference praise the lord we are alive
[1:17:20] and we are alive forever more
[1:17:25] amen sometimes we look at
[1:17:28] us we oh my goodness
[1:17:32] okay sometimes we look at us we fail to
[1:17:36] see what God is doing all we just see is
[1:17:40] our
[1:17:41] weaknesses all we just see is the
[1:17:43] struggles we are going through all we
[1:17:46] just see is the headaches the heartaches
[1:17:49] we forget that there is a God we are
[1:17:52] saing
[1:17:56] and when God looks down and he sees that
[1:18:01] you are in trouble he sends
[1:18:04] help he doesn't sit on the fence and
[1:18:07] just look at you no there is always help
[1:18:12] the angels of the Lord encom FR about
[1:18:14] them that fear Him and what is the fear
[1:18:17] of God having the respect for the
[1:18:21] word esteeming the word of God living by
[1:18:24] the
[1:18:25] word the angels of the Lord en cabine
[1:18:28] About You by day and by
[1:18:30] night and when you are in trouble they
[1:18:33] are there to your
[1:18:35] rescue the fifth man on the
[1:18:40] cross praise the
[1:18:51] Lord
[1:18:53] as I was talking about Moses in the
[1:18:57] wilderness we are in our Wilderness
[1:18:59] Journey
[1:19:01] now and it is it is a very difficult
[1:19:06] moment for
[1:19:07] anybody um it either brings the best out
[1:19:11] of you or it brings the worst out of
[1:19:16] you for
[1:19:19] Moses it just got to that point he
[1:19:21] couldn't handle it anymore
[1:19:26] out of
[1:19:29] anger he saw the promised land he didn't
[1:19:32] set his foot
[1:19:34] there and I was
[1:19:36] wondering I was
[1:19:38] wondering as we are going through our
[1:19:40] Wilderness
[1:19:42] Journey spiritually
[1:19:46] speaking by the time we come to the end
[1:19:48] of our road in this
[1:19:51] life where would we be
[1:19:56] standing this is where you have to make
[1:20:00] sure that you are earnestly contending
[1:20:03] for the faith
[1:20:06] earnestly if there was any time to fight
[1:20:09] it is
[1:20:10] now if there was any time to seek the
[1:20:13] face of God the most it is now if there
[1:20:17] was any
[1:20:20] time to glue yourself to the word it is
[1:20:24] now for heaven and Earth shall pass away
[1:20:27] but the word of God will never pass
[1:20:32] away everything is caving
[1:20:35] in this world has come to an
[1:20:38] end we have studed time and time and
[1:20:42] again praise the Lord but remember that
[1:20:47] we are on the winning side why because
[1:20:51] before the foundation of this world we
[1:20:53] were in him from the
[1:20:56] beginning brother one has been preaching
[1:20:58] a
[1:20:59] series from the
[1:21:01] beginning we were in
[1:21:03] him from the
[1:21:07] beginning before the foundation we were
[1:21:09] in
[1:21:12] him and he would never lose
[1:21:15] anyone he would never lose
[1:21:19] anyone praise the Lord
[1:21:26] so it was in the
[1:21:28] wilderness that a lot of the people
[1:21:30] filled
[1:21:32] him a lot of the
[1:21:35] people that saw the power of God that
[1:21:39] tested the power of God that saw God In
[1:21:42] Action they saw the pillar of fire they
[1:21:45] saw that cloud the pillar of cloud it
[1:21:48] was in the wilderness in spite of
[1:21:50] everything God was doing the let God
[1:21:54] down either last week or last two weeks
[1:21:57] when brother one was preaching he said
[1:22:00] that the end ending
[1:22:02] well this race is the ending well I'm
[1:22:06] I'm trying to put the pieces to ending
[1:22:09] well is very important um it's about
[1:22:13] ending well I don't know how many people
[1:22:15] remember that but that phrase caught me
[1:22:18] when I was sitting in the
[1:22:20] fo ending well
[1:22:27] you will hear some people say I used to
[1:22:30] I used to how about
[1:22:33] now what happened what went
[1:22:38] wrong he is the same yesterday today and
[1:22:41] forever he is an everpresent tense
[1:22:45] God not the god of yesterday he's also
[1:22:49] the god of today so how about today
[1:22:53] amen an everpresent tense
[1:22:56] God ending well on a good
[1:23:00] note is very very very
[1:23:06] imperative it doesn't matter how good
[1:23:09] the start
[1:23:11] is you can be leading the
[1:23:14] race and then you get before the tape
[1:23:17] maybe from here to this speaker and then
[1:23:20] you get there and you decide to St
[1:23:23] because you were leading and everybody
[1:23:25] comes and then they pass you just became
[1:23:31] late praise the
[1:23:33] Lord ending World in this race is of
[1:23:39] great
[1:23:42] importance it doesn't matter how many
[1:23:45] years you have been in the service of
[1:23:48] the
[1:23:49] Lord it doesn't matter how close
[1:23:54] you have come or how well you you think

[1:23:59] know stay with the
[1:24:02] word stay with the
[1:24:05] word do not let the word ever depart
[1:24:09] from you that is our anchor that is our
[1:24:13] strength that is the beauty of
[1:24:16] Christianity that a man can take the
[1:24:19] word of God and live by
[1:24:21] it that man can see God in your life
[1:24:25] that is the beauty of
