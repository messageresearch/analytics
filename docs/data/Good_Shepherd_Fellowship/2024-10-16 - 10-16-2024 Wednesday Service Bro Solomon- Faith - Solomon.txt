I'm all the way from West Africa s she has a small country in the west coast of Africa and uh I'm glad to be here this evening to also fellowship with you there has always been a little group and back home it's also a little group called The Bri little and so we feel good when we come around the little group the road is narrow the Bible say very few find it so it's a privilege and opportunity to see you on this other side May the grace of God continue to hold us as we press on the upward way I came in for about two weeks now and uh this is my last week I'll be going back by the grace of God

brother Dan and wife and the family yes they have been taking care of me for the few days it's so wonderful so precious people oh I I think I mean food what is food you know sometimes so so wonderful but this is what the message does to bring the children of God together I'm so happy to be here this evening um time will fail me there are many things many thoughts flow in my mind my life itself as I stand before you I'm a testimony but I pray and trust the Lord will give us an opportunity another time wherein I can share some of the experiences that I've had over the years and by the grace of God to why I find myself today I've seen many things I've heard many things confirming that this message of Malachi for is true am amen and so I want to be very grateful because of time I would venture to go into some of these things I would just want give preeminence to the word of God Amen um tonight I hope and pray that God will give me another opportunity to be here again we in weekend Fellowship we as you heard from him we went all the way from Arson we had a wonderful time there also with the Saints it's just so wonderful and I am happy here again tonight to see you to meet with you by the grace of God I will convey your greetings back home that we have our brothers and sisters on the other side amen who are also holy in the for amen yes so God bless you this evening I just want a little few thoughts to share with you by the grace of God and the message of the hour and I pray as I said let me don't take time just introducing myself I want to just lift the word high up tonight amen by the grace of God just pray with me shall we please stand while we read the word if you have a Bible with you please turn with me to the book of Hebrews you have a wonderful preacher here many great preachers are passing by so I'm just here to encourage ourselves you know this is just food that is laying there with counting on the Holy Spirit to just take maybe a portion of this food heit it up and give it to his children tonight amen I'm just a vessel and so I mean as I say you have a wonderful preacher I'm just just to remind ourselves though you once know these things so the Apostle Peter said we keep in remance of these things amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11 is a very familiar scripture I Believe by the grace of God a very familiar scripture Hebrews chapter 11 we'll read from verse 1-6 you see here now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the walls were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than King by which he obtained witness that he was righteous so righteousness by faith God testifying of his gift and by it he be dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him may God have blessings to theing of his word amen please be seated as I would you want to talk about faith when I read the scripture praying many many top come around I we just want to talk living by faith faith as a foundation is a very wide topic fath but I want us to look at it by the grace of God where the Apostle Paul say here and what the prophet and the message of theah the prophet of these days says about faith he but Abraham gave us an understanding of the scripture a clear understanding a deeper understanding of the scripture Paul says say faith is the substance of things hoped for Hallelujah and I realize that faith is very important in the Christian Journey yes because the Bible clearly states that without it it is impossible to please God so if you don't have faith I don't have faith we cannot please him amen amen no way when you look at this chapter the men there oh this precious Brothers everything by Faith by Faith by Faith by Faith by Faith by Faith by faith the life that we live the Christian life has to be a life of Faith amen hallelujah I'm telling you my people even our physical lives Hallelujah as we are living in the US wherever find they say have to live by faith yeah amen amen how much more the spiritual one it has to be and so we see said by it the elders obtain a very good report hallelujah amen amen that is why in this end time God sent us a prophet to Resource back to the faith of these fathers because that is the only way we can please God that's right I remember the scripture said sometime say anything you do outside of faith is so a life that we leave we are encouraged to live a life of Faith regardless of the situation now we see here the Apostle Paul who is the first Gentile Messenger to the church hallelujah amen he laid Faith as a foundation hallelujah amen amen if you read the message brother bam went further to give us a clear definition of understanding of actually what is f and that is where I want to emphasize tonight by the grace of God brother bam said faith is a revelation that's just a substance it's a revelation of the will of God am hallelujah amen amen I remember and not a revelation of who Christ is for this hour hallelujah amen remember one time Hallelujah so we see that what a revelation that is very important in the seven Church age prophet of God said he say the importance of a revelation to a True Believer by the spirit the Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized in other words that Revelation is fa and that is the only way we can please God hallelujah amen and amen oh I pray that the Lord will help me tonight Hallelujah the Bible say for without it it is impossible to please him one time the Lord Jesus Christ when God was here in the flesh he was living with his disciples he walked with them they fish together they live I mean they were together hallelujah amen amen one day he turned around and ask them this very important question who do men say that I am read the Bible some say you are Elijah some say you are Jeremiah some say you are this some say he never denied hallelujah amen but he turned around and father asked him who do you say Amen this a personal question hallelujah amen yes this is what they said but who do you say Amen amen it sounds naive it sounds funny they work together they live together they work together and you tell me who do you say that I am hallelujah amen sometimes it's very easy to say oh the Bible say the pastor say my friend said brother bam say the prophet said the prophet said but who do you see amen this messages that's right brother come come on praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I believe there was silence Amen in the room this one will be tur to this one Hallelujah the whole place was quiet hallelujah amen oh my what a divine revelation hallelujah amen say thou the Christ the son of the Living God Amen then Jesus looked at him he realized it was not Peter by himself it was not his effort it was not how much he studied yes not how much he fasted and prayed it was not because he was sincere it was not flesh and blood but by God hallelujah amen that's right so Revelation is divine that ration is not by Flesh and Blood because God is has always be hiding God is always he in that vessel that man that flesh that Carpenter son according to them That Man From Galilee say who do you say that I am how could he have known it has to be from Divine yes praise the Lord hallelujah amen Jesus Christ look at Peter and said and you know these things we are just reching them he said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell not one Gat gates gates of fornication adultery false Doctrine lying slothfulness weaknesses shot Prevail [Music] am amen how can I begin to realize brother said he could not build his no God canot build his church Upon A man no no no no upon the revelation of who he Christ is that's right when he builds a church imagine if God you know if God could build a Church his church upon Revelation then you would you you imagine how strong is revelation how powerful is revelation because the foundation of everything is very important amen amen amen it matters amen hallelujah amen it Upon This Rock I went to the scriptures of reading the Old Testament when they building houses you realize they build on rocks the house you read the Bible time will fail because of time I'm a little bit of teaching but because of time I could not go into some of these things and then you realize that is it's built upon Rock so Jesus Christ said upon this I will build my church and the gates of hell oh my Hallelujah I don't care how the gates could be they will not Prevail against that church that is buil upon the Revelation that is why brother said the importance of a revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized we've seen as we walk along the journey we have seen a lot of things that is why it bees us to have a revelation of who Christ is for this hour amen thank you Lord that is what will sustain us that is what will Empower us amen Revelation gives strength amen Revelation gives life oh my Hallelujah am amen amen amen yes it is not given by flesh and blood do we have a projector he's not working tonight okay it's okay I just want us to look at the scriptures if we can go to Galatians Revelation is not no matter the revelation of the pastor is not enough for you my Revelation revelation of the husband is not enough for the wife it is God that gives it amen when Apostle Paul believed the Lord let's go to first I mean Galatians chapter 1:15 can somebody please read the scripture for me Galatians 1:15 okay but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace go next to reveal his son in meise God hallelujah that I might preach him among the Heen h immediately I confer not with flesh and blood go so Revelation is not by Flesh and Blood it is divine am hallelujah amen so Jesus Christ said he said I'm going to build my church upon Revelation that is why you see the same time hallelujah it's about the the revelation of Jesus Christ amen who is Christ Christ is the word yes Amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the word was made flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah let's listen to the prophet oh my yes sir here we see that when the Apostle Paul came if you see the statue of a perfect man do we have it can we project it if not but we all know it we see the foundation is faith brother brah said that is the individual that is going to the Rapture said that is the temple of God that is the Church of the Living God Amen it's the foundation of Faith the revelation of Christ so there is where you build you build so now ujah amen Paul say I confir not with flesh and blood he had a revelation he never went to man he received a divine revelation of all the churches and what did he see he say as a wise master builder Hallelujah read the scriptures Hallelujah he say as a wise master builder I have le the foundation I think that you find that in 1 Corinthians 3:9 to1 I hope I'm right hallelujah amen let's see the Apostle I'm just laying a foundation here can you see that sometime so for we are laborers together with God ye are God's H ye are God's Building the building of God God is going to build a building go further Hallelujah according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder say he has the virtue of Faith he laid the foundation he's not telling us that as a wise master I have laid the foundation amen and another be there on but let every man take heed how he be let there upon Hallelujah for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is what Jesus Christ that's right Jesus Christ today is the word amen amen that is the foundation he told Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church brother say that is the revelation of who Christ is am that is where the message holds onto Hallelujah so my brothers and sisters we need to have a revelation of this message and this is not given by the pastor no by a friend or brother husband or wife it is given by God by his grace I believe God he loves us that is why he brought us here to give us a revelation so as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation so any man that wants to build upon it let him know he said that Foundation is Jesus Christ Hallelujah and uh I want to tell you from experience even yourself with your experiences in life you know that Foundation is very important in everything in marriage Foundation is very important that's right if you miss the foundation in marriage hey that is another story education the foundation has to be solid everything even his physical beliefs the foundation has to be solid we are here because the foundation of this B is solid yes amen you can walk with confidence yeah because the foundation is solid hallelujah amen amen now if we can go to Luke chapter 6 47-49 Jesus Christ was giving us a parable you have to be ready my my friend I will be reading scriptures amen Luke 4 Luke 6 yes 47-49 whosoever cometh to me and heareth my Saints and doth them I will show you I will show you to him he like yes he is like a man which builded an house and died deep and led the foundation on a rock oh my Hallelujah yes yes and L the foundation yes and here Foundation I built upon the rock and L the foundation of The Rock when the flood arose and the stream beat vly upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon rock that is the only thing that will surviv man that is the only foundation that is why a lot of people today realize that because the foundation is not solid why do you come to the message because my friend just because my friend invited me because I was looking for an opportunity um I want to survive so your that Foundation is wrong want to please my friend you know it will not survive amen yes because it will be tried by situation by circumstances on hallelujah amen and when that Foundation is not solid oh my great and then but the Bible say I have seen back home I have seen very there is a building two big buildings that have been built and spent mightly spent on it but they realize it becomes uninhabited nobody could go into the house why very big build in the center of the city which could have given money to the owner said nobody should go in there why the foundation was not built to take to carry maybe a four story building it's condemned will be passing what you know in cre say what happened to this house everything happened to this h what happens to this house they said the foundation is not prepared it's not designed to carry nobody in why the foundation so Foundation is very important in the physical Liv Foundation is about spiritual lives we must be sure of our foundation am make sure for election and our calling amen hallelujah amen so Paul if the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ is buil the foundation is Faith to carry all he very important oh my hallelujah amen please bear with me that is how I preach I take my time Hallelujah so the foolish man the bible say that man is a foolish man he was he he didn't want to suffer everything just easy for me just you know if you if you are building on a rock F town is a very rocky place sometimes when you go when you drill down you meet a rock I remember there were build a build the center of town because we have many rocks around it took two years to just excavate every time you see drilling machine because they want to plant the building there because there is a rock it took time come this message make sure that your foundation is solid why are you here it will take time pray seek the face of the Lord make sure don't assume it is God that does the work amen it is by the grace of God yes Hallelujah and so brother say in the message he said the church is built upon the foundation of the revelation of the word Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the Gat of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen in the St of a perfect man say notice you must be born again when you are born again you can't be born again without having faith statue of a perfect man paragraph 102 you can't be born again without having faith so you see when a man is born again he has Faith Romans said the just shall live by faith zerance yeah much the just shall live by faith sometimes you have faith as a seed Hallelujah like a that se you are different different type of Faith do you know that yes so Faith as a gift somebody can have a gift of faith it does things yes according to the scripture scripture now yes cast out so you can even have faith to move mountains not that that's not the type of faith that God has came to restore in this end time it is the entire word the SE fith the entire Faith which is the word Christ yeah Jesus Christ he turn the hearts of the children back to the faith yeah the faith of the fathers oh my Hallelujah aen brother said in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he had three male purpose three full purpose we we know them I mean don't doubt our pastor Hallelujah a great teacher three full purpose one to reveal himself Revelation is very important too why is the First full purpose when you come to him that's the first want to reveal himself because he has always been hidden throughout the ages from the Old Testament to the even when he came so in this end time he has to reveal himself to you amen so that is the first thing that God then then he has preeminence in you then to restore take us back to that restored that's right praise the Lord there is power in Revelation amen I'm telling you so what God does when you know a man who he is you know how to serve him that is a principle of God so when you know who actually God is then you know how to worship Him amen our sacrifices our worship our services to God is a measure of the revelation of God that we have him amen you are here tonight because you have a revelation of the word to be here you know what it means to even lose maybe two or three hours job your hours for the few dollars that will pass away to come to church and feed upon the word of God Amen it takes a revelation amen and that it's not flesh and blood it's not the pastor that will tell you come come no anything that you do in the church has to be by Revelation even your giving your offerings that have to be Revelation Hallelujah if you don't give it a revelation there is no blessing yes amen but you only have a revelation depending upon the knowledge of what you have so that is why the first thing that God does he reveals himself to his children the first thing Moses was born a prophet he was born to deliver but God had to reveal himself to him because he's going to declare a God that he should know amen amen in Exodus chapter 3 he had been in Egypt for all his wife science he knows all the great things full of knowledge yeah full of oh full of knowledge and then God said this I need to reveal myself to him you can see go and read the scripture you see the encounter between Moses and God see to tell you Revelation is very important in Exodus chapter 3 verse six just project it let's see what let's just see the account there hallelujah oh brother the revelation of he said the importance of a revelation say more he said I am the god of thy father what is God is introducing himself listen carefully the god of Abraham now let's look here from Moses to Abraham is a bit far maybe Moses heard about Abraham but he doesn't know who Abraham was yes the god of Isaac he still making himself known maybe if he doesn't know Abraham he might know Isaac and the god of Jacob from Jacob now is very close this is the grandfather of Moses called Levi yeah so oh that is the god why because there is power in Revelation time will fail you have many things the first encounter God has with a man is to show himself to that person because there is power in Revelation amen I remember I was told a story I always like to share that story back home of a little boy who has in America I see people they have they have a lot of dogs some of them they are like beer some like Lion you know I mean different different breeds of of of of this pets well treated this little boy has his little dog it CAU missing in a village it went into the forest he's used to this dog he's glue to this dog perhaps maybe maybe black or whatever the name might be you know your names that you can give to dogs I said this dog got missing the boy was going around the forest looking for Bingo maybe Bingo or black whatever the name looking for it in the nearby forest and he went he met a lion just like his dog the little boy innocent he never knew it was a lion the lion saw the boy that this boy is innocent he took a rope a chain he put it by the neck okay I'll be looking for you come you go come let's go I look at say you don't know me if you know me you not treat me this way and so they were going he said those who know me if they see me he will see and he dragged it was coming Bingo Bingo Bingo let's go by the time he ENT The Village there was shouting everybody was running away hter and SC say I told you you don't know me those who know me have reacted what is that we are talking about Revelation when you know a man you know how to treat him when you know a woman you know how to treat him if you know God you know how to worship him so that is why the first thing we come when you come to God God what God reveals himself to youen with all the supernatural Apostle the wonderful things that many people come around the message they don't know God they don't know the message amen that is why they will go along the line the message is error the message is that they don't have a revelation they see all sorts of things they don't know that this is God in our hands amen hallelujah except God reveal himself to you look at it has to be divine so that is why brother B said the importance of the Revelation to a Believer can never be overemphasize amen amen amen time is f spent I think I should be close by 9 I'm I'm very conscious of time sir amen amen may the Lord help amen yeah say here in the Romans chapter 1 verse1 17 for there in the righteous of God is revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith and brother mom say what this what is a faith is a revelation Hallelujah in other message say a revelation of the will of God hallelujah amen Paul say faith is the substance of things to hope for the evidence of s not sin do you know that in the message Rapture because of time I try to wrap up brother said even the Rapture is a revelation yeah amen I'll read that quote before I go at least to do justice amen amen he said he said he said the just shall live by faith hallelujah amen amen amen yes yeah and uh I want us to just look at uh Colossians chapter23 faith we are talking about faith the Bible said by Faith by Faith by Faith by faith you know that was by Revelation by Revelation by Revelation by Revelation that even Enoch had a testimony that he pleased God so if you don't have a revelation it is impossible to please God if we can just substitute the words there according to the message by Faith by Revelation it is impossible to please go without without Revelation it's impossible to please God so anything that you do in the church without Revelation you're not pleasing God so we need a revelation the song that you are leading the instrument that you have a revelation you know this is it is revealed to me yes amen that's righten all the time the pastoring you pushing you brother no even to come to church you have to have a revelation of coming to church am am because without that we Cann all please him yes my friend just project for me you see by Faith by Revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent and sacrifice than that of Kain by Revelation by Faith by Revelation so Revelation makes the difference the other guy held on to the letter Mama and Papa said it was fruit so if God is asking for sacrifice I come with fruit but Abel had a revelation maybe Adam was stealing them said my son this is what happened one day God came down in with head food but at the end he said God came in the evening he slaughtered an animal you know and he see Revelation taught him that it was blood by Revelation the other guy hel the letter the fruit five flowers five fruits to the altar what makes the difference upon the sacrifice is the Revelation amen amen that's right so even righteousness is by faith righteousness is by Revelation oh my oh Hallelujah yes sir in the Statue of a perfect man if you continue the faith grounded and settled and be not move away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven wherefore Paul and made a minister amen hallelujah now let me just look at this scripture here in the Statue of a perfect man paragraph 140 and that is why I'm here this morning is to try to te the little church myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God amen amen how many like to be that the dwelling place of the Living God God is building the church now here is what we do what is the first thing have faith and be born again amen amen this first brother he was telling them that said You Brothers you go and read that message he said you there were Carpenters those Brothers brother wood brother CS say you are carpenters you can build a physical house but I am going to show you how to build a spiritual house amen amen hallelujah amen he said here he said now here is what we do what is the first thing have faith and be born again that is laying the foundation are you projecting it I want the CH to see so to not be I reading my own thing start off perfect man Hallelujah anyway brother say here that then after we lay the foundation secondly we add to your foundation it is Faith so it's very clear that faith is the foundation of Christianity hallelujah amen amen he say Peter said here add to First you have faith then add virtue to your faith add Faith hallelujah amen amen he said now here is where the thing comes in this morning we are going to talk about now all right a house this Foundation is fast what is the foundation of Christianity this is the prophet now speaking he say what is the foundation of Christianity faith in the word of God am that's right today the word of God is the message of the hour am that is your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this Foundation sometimes people will just come and just join the church what is your foundation in paragraph 135 building a house put your upright and everything else he said brother W and some of you carpenters and contractors here could tell us how you build your house see but I am going to tell you how to build your spiritual house amen where God can dwell he wants to dwell in you he wants to make you like himself he wants to be reflected reflecting rather his being yeah amen amen amen hallelujah amen that is why he sent us Mal 4 to turn the hearts of the children back I wish I had time to go into some of those things time to turn the heart of the children back to the faith which is the foundation before Oh My hallelujah amen now Faith is very important now he said now seven Church age book he said now the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things according to Malachi 4 he will turn the heart of of the children to the fathers Faith of Our Fathers he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seals but say it will be this divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers so you see the mystery has got to reveal the mystery is given where say though it is revealed there are still some Supernatural elements attached to it they have to be revealed the word of has to be revealed because it is a personal thing amen that is why they could took the salmon books they read them and they see something else but we see Christ Hallelujah we see Faith Hallelujah that is what is going to sustain us this hour you Lord [Music] amen now now oh my in BL Blasphemous names 1962 brother BR preach this message he said the biggest part of our faith is mental have you heard that quote before yeah say the biggest part of our faith is mental so there is mental Faith it's just in the senses I mean all believe that Jesus Christ is you know that's why we are here you know God there is a God that is mental yes Jesus Christ is our savior is mental yes God the pro it's mental has to be revealed that's statement no one can say Jesus Christ is God what by the Holy Ghost so when is man born he has the Holy Ghost oh my say except a man is born again he cannot see the kingom to see what is to understand amen that's right so understand what the word God bless you Sister now may God help us now he say here he said the he say said the biggest of part of our faith is mental by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God you hear the word faith come by hearing yeah that is mental it is not also bad it is good not that mental faith is bad that is where you start you hear it mentally yeah that it brings us to a mental recognition of God hallelujah my time is up want to follow the church oh my church can I go ahead sir okay please sir oh my I don't want to be funny said it brings us to a mental recognition of God but if this coming from above oh brother if it strikes this there is a Godly spiritual Fai Spirit has to come to anoint that mental Faith that's right for you to become real am he say he say then what does that Faith do Faith recognizes only the word no matter what anything else says it only recognize the word because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was still God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation amen amen and upon this Foundation I will build my church see not upon a mental conception of church joining let me go and join the church in in in in in in Minneapolis I don't know how oh let me come no it's not upon Church joining no hallelujah amen he said that but upon the Revelation when the streams of Grace has poured into the mental faith that you've got then upon this a spiritual Revelation I will build my church the gates of hell can't Prevail against it that shows they will be against it yes yes it say shall not be against that shows they will be against it amen whenever God say fear not it means there something fearful yes yes it's just prepare your mind like a father and a son walking in darkness don't be afraid of that mean the father seen something is preparing the son fear not hallelujah amen said the GS of hell that we Gates of Hell there are many gates of hell around but to that church that brother that sister that has a revelation it not have Hallelujah that is Christ the solid Revelation the message of the hour I will build my church The Gat of hell can't Prevail against it see that shows that they will be against it but with will never Prevail oh a glorious thing now see fith Hallelujah and the message Rapture to the true B of Christ The Rapture is a revelation amen hallelujah let me close with this story are many things I could have said but let me just jump up and close here the prophet in the message expectations sometimes I I I Feast on the early messages hey the s open 1963 1963 that the angel was with brother bam even before the SE were open all those things the word of God the foundation that will start is good the message is the message the entirety of Christ you find many things in those things those messages not long in Houston Texas I came to America I begin to understand this this these states are begin to say Min Poli oh I I felt good say oh the message becomes real to me he say here no longer in there was a boy came by I believe

sympathizing Jesus when the angel of God in a wheel of Hall wi down in the room where I was at and I thought the custodian turned the light on me here when I had a little boy in my arms I dropped him why the Nazarene girl playing the piano she jumped up and started running and screaming she said see that little boy walking off the platform normal why she jumped she was playing the great physician and it just kept playing on the great physician now is near the sympathizing Jesus he speaks the droing heart to cheer no other name but Jesus there he was playing about an hour or two after that this old man came through the line I prayed for him he had a line coming just as fast as he could two men was leading him he was blind he said is this Reverend branam I said yes sir he said well heal me he

Ministry to show you what to do to be saved no don't do this don't do this don't do that that that one when a revelation come you know what to do yes come on that's [Applause] right because the things
