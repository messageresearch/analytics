[0:17] whoever heard of a son
[0:18] being eternal sons have beginnings but
[0:21] that which is eternal never had a
[0:23] beginning
[0:24] he is the eternal god jehovah manifested
[0:27] in the flesh
[0:29] in saint john's gospel it says in the
[0:32] beginning was the word and the word was
[0:33] with god
[0:34] and the word was god and the word was
[0:37] made flesh and dwelt among us
[0:40] he was the true and faithful witness to
[0:42] the father's eternal word
[0:44] he was a prophet and could say what the
[0:46] father bad him say
[0:48] he said my father is in me that is what
[0:51] jesus the tabernacle said
[0:53] my father is in me god has many titles
[0:58] our righteousness and our peace and
[1:00] ever-present
[1:01] and father and son and holy ghost
[1:04] but he has only one human name and that
[1:07] name is jesus
[1:09] don't be confused because he has three
[1:11] offices or that he has a three-fold
[1:13] manifestation
[1:15] on earth he was a prophet in heaven he
[1:17] is the priest
[1:18] and coming back to earth he is king of
[1:20] kings
[1:22] he that was that is jesus the prophet
[1:25] he that is that is he the high priest
[1:28] making intercession
[1:30] one who can be touched with the feelings
[1:31] of our infirmities
[1:33] which is to come that is the coming king
[1:37] on earth he was the word the prophet
[1:40] moses said of him
[1:42] the lord your god will raise up a
[1:43] prophet like unto me
[1:45] and it will come to pass if they don't
[1:46] hear the words of that prophet
[1:48] they will be cut off from amongst the
[1:50] people
[1:51] notice these facts about jesus on earth
[1:54] he was prophet
[1:56] lamb and son this did not make him three
[1:59] these were but manifestations or offices
[2:02] of the one person
[2:03] jesus now there is a very favorite
[2:06] portion of scripture
[2:07] that the trinitarians think proved their
[2:09] point of more than one actual person in
[2:11] the godhead
[2:12] it is revelation 5 6 through 8
[2:16] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[2:18] throne and of the four beasts
[2:20] and in the midst of the elders stood a
[2:22] lamb as it had been slain
[2:24] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[2:27] are the seven spirits of god
[2:28] sent forth into all the earth and he
[2:31] came and took the book out of the right
[2:33] hand of him that sat upon the throne
[2:35] and when he had taken the book the four
[2:37] beasts and four and twenty elders fell
[2:40] down before the lamb
[2:41] having every one of them harps and
[2:43] golden vials full of odors
[2:45] which are the prayers of saints indeed
[2:48] these verses if isolated would seem to
[2:50] prove their point
[2:51] you notice i said these isolated verses
[2:55] however read revelation four two through
[2:57] three and nine through eleven
[3:00] and immediately i was in the spirit and
[3:02] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[3:04] one sat on the throne
[3:06] and he that set was to look upon like a
[3:09] jasper and a sardine stone
[3:11] and there was a rainbow round about the
[3:13] throne in sight like unto an emerald
[3:16] and when those beasts give glory and
[3:18] honor and thanks to him that sat on the
[3:20] throne
[3:21] who liveth forever and ever the four and
[3:23] twenty elders fall down before him that
[3:26] sat on the throne
[3:27] and worship him that liveth forever and
[3:29] ever and cast their crowns before the
[3:31] throne
[3:32] saying thou art worthy o lord to receive
[3:35] glory
[3:35] and honor and power for thou hast
[3:38] created all things
[3:40] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[3:42] created
[3:44] carefully note in verse 2 it says one
[3:47] not two or three but one sat on the
[3:50] throne
[3:52] in verse three it says he not they
[3:56] was to look upon as a jasper stone in
[3:59] verse 9 it says that the beasts gave
[4:01] honor to him
[4:02] not them in verse 10 it says that the
[4:06] elders fell down before him
[4:08] not them in verse 11 it says that they
[4:12] cried
[4:12] thou art worthy o lord not lords
[4:17] also in verse 11 it says this one on the
[4:19] throne was the creator
[4:21] which is jesus john 1 3
[4:24] which is jehovah spirit god of the old
[4:27] testament
[4:28] genesis 1 1
[4:31] but let us not stop there read now in
[4:34] revelation 3
[4:35] 21 to him that overcometh will i grant
[4:39] to sit with me in my throne
[4:41] even as i also overcame and am set down
[4:43] with my father in his throne
[4:46] also read hebrews 12 2
[4:49] looking unto jesus the author and
[4:51] finisher of our faith
[4:52] who for the joy that was set before him
[4:54] endured the cross
[4:56] despising the shame and is set down at
[4:58] the right hand of the throne of god
[5:01] notice that according to jesus himself
[5:03] who wrote the revelation
[5:05] he has sat down with the father the
[5:07] spirit in paul
[5:09] which spirit is the spirit of christ for
[5:11] that is the spirit of prophecy whereby
[5:13] the word comes
[5:14] says he is set down at the right hand of
[5:17] god
[5:18] but when john looked he saw only one
[5:21] upon the throne
[5:22] and it was not until revelation 5 6-8
[5:26] which follows revelation 4 2-3 in
[5:29] sequence of time
[5:30] that we see the lamb taking the book
[5:33] from him
[5:34] that sat on the throne as indicated in
[5:36] revelation 4 2
[5:38] through 3 and 9-10 what is it
[5:42] it is the mystery of one god
[5:45] he jesus came out from god became
[5:47] manifested in flesh
[5:49] died and rose again and returned to the
[5:51] bosom of the father
[5:53] as john said the only begotten son which
[5:56] is in the bosom of the father
[5:58] he has declared him john 1 18
[6:02] it was now time for god messiah to come
[6:06] back to claim his bride and then present
[6:07] himself make himself known to israel
[6:11] thus we see god again stepping forth to
[6:13] assume a physical relationship to man as
[6:15] the
[6:16] son of david king of kings and lord of
[6:19] lords
[6:20] and bridegroom of the gentile bride it
[6:23] is not
[6:24] two gods but simply one god manifesting
[6:26] his mighty triune offices and titles
[6:30] the people knew he was a prophet they
[6:33] knew the sign of the messiah which could
[6:34] come only through the prophet
[6:37] john 1 44-51 now philip was of bethsaida
[6:41] the city of andrew and peter philip
[6:44] findeth nathanael and saith unto him
[6:46] we have found him of whom moses in the
[6:49] law and the prophets did right
[6:51] jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and
[6:54] nathanael said unto him
[6:56] can there any good thing come out of
[6:57] nazareth philip sayeth unto him come and
[7:00] see jesus saw nathanael coming to him
[7:03] and saith of him
[7:05] behold an israelite indeed in whom there
[7:07] is no guile
[7:08] nathanael saith unto him whence knowest
[7:11] thou me
[7:12] jesus answered and said unto him before
[7:15] that philip called thee when thou wasted
[7:17] under the fig tree i saw thee
[7:19] nathanael answered and saith unto him
[7:22] rabbi thou art the son of god
[7:24] thou art the king of israel jesus
[7:26] answered and said unto him
[7:28] because i said unto thee i saw thee
[7:30] under the fig tree believeth thou
[7:32] thou shalt see greater things than these
[7:35] and he saith unto him
[7:37] verily verily i say unto you hereafter
[7:39] you shall see heaven open and the angels
[7:41] of god ascending and descending upon the
[7:43] son of man
[7:46] the ability to discern the hard thoughts
[7:48] in men made the elect of god to
[7:49] understand that here was the messiah
[7:52] the anointed word of god hebrews 4
[7:55] 12 for the word of god is quick and
[7:58] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[8:00] sword
[8:01] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[8:03] soul and spirit
[8:04] and of the joints and marrow and is a
[8:07] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[8:08] the heart
[8:10] when the woman at the well heard him
[8:12] discern the thoughts of her heart
[8:14] she acclaimed him a prophet declaring
[8:16] that messiah would be known for that
[8:18] great ability
[8:19] john 4 7-26 there cometh a woman of
[8:23] samaria to draw water
[8:25] jesus saith unto her give me to drink
[8:28] for his disciples were gone away unto
[8:30] the city to buy meat
[8:32] then saith the woman of samaria unto him
[8:34] how is it that thou being a jew ask us
[8:37] drink of me
[8:38] which i am a woman of samaria for the
[8:40] jews have no dealings with the
[8:42] samaritans
[8:43] jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[8:46] knewest the gift of god and who it is
[8:48] that saith to thee give me to drink
[8:50] thou what is to have asked of him and he
[8:52] would have given thee living water
[8:55] the woman saith unto him sir thou has
[8:58] nothing to draw with and the well is
[8:59] deep
[9:00] from once then hast thou that living
[9:02] water art thou greater than our father
[9:05] jacob which gave us the well
[9:06] and drank thereof himself and his
[9:08] children and his cattle
[9:10] jesus answered and said unto her
[9:13] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[9:14] thirst again
[9:16] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[9:18] i shall give him shall never thirst
[9:20] but the water that i shall give him
[9:22] shall be in him a well of water
[9:24] springing up into everlasting life
[9:26] the woman saith unto him sir give me
[9:29] this water that i thirst not
[9:31] neither come hither to draw jesus saith
[9:34] unto her go
[9:36] call thy husband and come hither the
[9:38] woman answered and said
[9:40] i have no husband. jesus said unto her
[9:43] thou hast well said i have no husband
[9:46] for thou hast had five husbands
[9:48] and he whom thou now hast is not thy
[9:51] husband
[9:52] and that says thou truly the woman saith
[9:55] unto him
[9:56] sir i perceive that thou art a prophet
[9:58] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[10:01] and you say that in jerusalem is the
[10:02] place where men ought to worship
[10:05] jesus saith unto her woman believe me
[10:08] the hour cometh
[10:09] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[10:11] nor yet at jerusalem worship the father
[10:14] ye worship ye know not what we know what
[10:17] we worship
[10:18] for salvation is of the jews but the
[10:20] hour cometh and now
[10:22] is when the true worshipers shall
[10:24] worship the father in spirit and in
[10:26] truth
[10:27] for the father seeketh such to worship
[10:28] him god
[10:30] is a spirit and they that worship him
[10:32] must worship him
[10:33] in spirit and in truth the woman saith
[10:36] unto him
[10:37] i know that messiahs cometh which is
[10:40] called christ
[10:41] when he has come he will tell us all
[10:43] things jesus saith unto her
[10:46] i that speak unto thee am he
[10:50] in revelations 15 3 it says
[10:53] and they sing the song of moses the
[10:55] servant of god
[10:56] and the song of the lamb saying great
[10:59] and marvelous are thy works lord god
[11:01] almighty
[11:02] just and true are thy ways thou king of
[11:04] saints
[11:06] do you see it the lamb the high priest
[11:09] holding his blood as an atonement on the
[11:10] mercy seat for our sins is the lord god
[11:13] almighty
[11:14] that is his present office that is what
[11:17] he is doing now
[11:19] pleading his blood for our sins but one
[11:22] day that lamb will become the lion of
[11:24] the tribe of judah
[11:25] he will come forth in power and glory
[11:27] and take his authority to reign as king
[11:30] he is the coming king of this earth of
[11:33] course that does not say he is not king
[11:35] now
[11:36] for he is our king king of the saints
[11:39] right now it is a spiritual kingdom
[11:42] it is not of this world system even as
[11:44] we are not of this world
[11:46] that's the reason we act different from
[11:47] the world our citizenship is in heaven
[11:50] we reflect the spirit of the world of
[11:52] our rebirth where jesus is the king
[11:55] that is why our women do not dress in
[11:57] men's clothing or cut their hair or use
[11:59] all those cosmetics and other things
[12:01] that the world likes so much
[12:03] that is why our men don't drink and
[12:05] smoke and carry on in sin
[12:07] our dominion is the dominion over sin
[12:10] and it is enforced through the power
[12:12] that is in the spirit of christ that
[12:13] indwells us every kingdom on earth is
[12:16] going to be torn down
[12:17] but ours will remain now we've been
[12:21] talking about the offices and
[12:22] manifestations of the one true god
[12:25] and beholding his glory in a scriptural
[12:27] study
[12:28] but he is not to be known intellectually
[12:30] he is known spiritually
[12:32] by spiritual revelation this same one
[12:35] who was known as jesus after the flesh
[12:37] went back to the pillar of fire
[12:39] but he promised he would come again and
[12:41] dwell amongst his people by the spirit
[12:44] and on the day of pentecost that pillar
[12:46] of fire came down and it separated
[12:48] itself in tongues of fire upon each one
[12:50] of them
[12:52] what was god doing he was separating
[12:54] himself into the church
[12:56] giving all those men and women a part of
[12:58] himself
[13:00] he divided himself amongst his church
[13:02] just as he said he would
[13:04] john 14 16-23
[13:07] and i will pray the father and he shall
[13:09] give you another comforter
[13:11] but he may abide with you forever even
[13:13] the spirit of truth
[13:15] whom the world cannot receive because it
[13:17] seeth him not
[13:18] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[13:21] he dwelleth with you
[13:23] and shall be in you i will not leave you
[13:25] comfortless
[13:26] i will come to you yet a little while
[13:29] and the world seeth me no more
[13:31] but ye see me because i live ye shall
[13:34] live also
[13:35] at that day ye shall know that i am in
[13:37] my father and ye
[13:38] in me and i in you he that have my
[13:42] commandments
[13:43] and keepeth them he it is that loveth me
[13:46] and he that loveth me shall be loved of
[13:48] my father
[13:49] and i will love him and will manifest
[13:51] myself to him
[13:53] judas saith unto him not iscariot
[13:57] lord how is it that thou wilt manifest
[13:59] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[14:02] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[14:04] man love me he will keep my words
[14:07] and my father will love him and we will
[14:09] come unto him
[14:10] and make our abode with him he said that
[14:12] he would pray the father who would send
[14:14] another comforter who was with them
[14:17] the disciples already but not in them
[14:20] that was christ then in verse 23
[14:24] speaking of himself and the father he
[14:26] said we will come
[14:27] there it is the spirit is coming the
[14:30] same spirit of god that manifested as
[14:32] the father
[14:33] and as the son and will yet manifest in
[14:36] the many
[14:37] one god who is spirit
[14:44] that's why no man can ever come along
[14:46] and say the holy man is a pope or the
[14:48] holy man is a bishop or priest
[14:50] the holy man is christ the holy spirit
[14:53] in us
[14:54] how dare the hierarchy declare the laity
[14:56] has no word to say
[14:58] each one has something to say each has a
[15:01] work each has a ministry
[15:03] the holy ghost came at pentecost and
[15:05] separated himself on each
[15:06] that it might be fulfilled whereof
[15:08] christ said
[15:10] at that day ye shall know that i am in
[15:12] my father and ye in me and i
[15:14] in you john 14 20.
[15:17] the great i am the almighty god has come
[15:20] as spirit to fill his true church
[15:22] he has a right to move anywhere he wants
[15:24] to and upon anybody he wants to
[15:27] we don't make any holy men amongst us
[15:30] but the whole true congregation of the
[15:31] lord is holy
[15:32] because of the presence of the holy
[15:34] spirit it is he
[15:36] the holy spirit that is holy not the
[15:38] congregation of itself
[15:40] now that is the revelation jesus christ
[15:44] is god
[15:45] the jehovah of the old testament is the
[15:47] jesus of the new
[15:49] no matter how hard you try you can't
[15:51] prove there are three gods but it also
[15:54] takes a revelation by the holy spirit
[15:56] to make you understand the truth that he
[15:58] is one
[16:00] it takes a revelation to see that the
[16:02] jehovah of the old testament is the
[16:03] jesus of the new
[16:05] satan crept into the church and blinded
[16:07] the people to this truth
[16:09] and when they were blinded to it it
[16:11] wasn't long until the church of rome
[16:13] stopped baptizing in the name of the
[16:14] lord jesus christ
[16:16] i admit that it takes a real revelation
[16:18] from the holy ghost
[16:20] to see the truth about the godhead these
[16:22] days when we are in the midst of the
[16:23] perverting of so much scripture
[16:25] but the prevailing overcoming church is
[16:28] built on revelation so we can expect god
[16:30] to reveal his truth to us
[16:32] however you actually don't need a
[16:34] revelation on water baptism
[16:36] it is right there staring you in the
[16:38] face would it be possible for one minute
[16:41] for the apostles to be led astray from a
[16:43] direct command of the lord
[16:45] to baptize in the name of the father and
[16:46] the son and the holy ghost and then find
[16:49] them in willful disobedience
[16:51] they knew what the name was and there is
[16:53] not one place in scripture where they
[16:55] baptized
[16:56] any other way than in the name of the
[16:57] lord jesus christ
[16:59] common sense would tell you that the
[17:01] book of acts is the church in action
[17:04] and if they baptize that way then that
[17:05] is the way to baptize
[17:07] now if you think that is strong what do
[17:10] you think of this
[17:11] anyone who was not baptized in the name
[17:13] of the lord jesus had to be baptized
[17:15] over again
[17:16] acts 19 1-6 and it came to pass
[17:21] that while apollos was at corinth paul
[17:23] having passed through the upper coasts
[17:25] came to ephesus and finding certain
[17:27] disciples
[17:28] he said unto them have you received the
[17:30] holy ghost since he believed
[17:32] and they said unto him we have not so
[17:35] much as heard whether there be any holy
[17:37] ghost
[17:38] and he said unto them unto what then
[17:40] were ye baptized
[17:42] and they said unto john's baptism
[17:45] then said paul john barely baptized with
[17:48] the baptism of repentance
[17:49] saying unto the people that they should
[17:51] believe on him what should come after
[17:53] him
[17:54] that is on christ jesus when they heard
[17:57] this they were baptized in the name of
[17:58] the lord jesus
[18:00] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[18:02] them the holy ghost came on them
[18:04] and they spake with tongues and
[18:05] prophesied
[18:07] there it is these good people at ephesus
[18:09] had heard about the coming messiah
[18:12] john had preached him they were baptized
[18:14] unto repentance of sins
[18:16] looking forward to believing on jesus
[18:19] but now it was time to look back to
[18:20] jesus and be baptized unto remission of
[18:23] sins
[18:24] it was time to receive the holy ghost
[18:26] and when they were baptized in the name
[18:28] of the lord jesus christ
[18:30] paul laid his hands on them and the holy
[18:32] ghost came upon them
[18:34] all those dear folks at ephesus were
[18:36] fine people and if anyone had a right to
[18:38] feel secure they did
[18:40] notice how far they had come they had
[18:42] come all the way up to accepting the
[18:44] coming messiah
[18:45] they were ready for him but don't you
[18:48] see that in spite of that they had
[18:49] missed him
[18:50] he had come and gone they needed to be
[18:53] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[18:55] christ
[18:56] they needed to be filled with the holy
[18:57] ghost if you have been baptized in the
[19:00] name of the lord jesus christ god will
[19:02] fill you with his spirit
[19:04] that is the word acts 19 6 which we read
[19:08] was the fulfilling of acts 2 38
[19:11] repent and be baptized every one of you
[19:13] in the name of jesus christ for the
[19:14] remission of sins
[19:16] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[19:18] holy ghost
[19:19] see paul by the holy ghost said exactly
[19:22] what peter said by the holy
[19:24] ghost and what was said cannot be
[19:26] changed
[19:27] it has to be the same from pentecost
[19:29] until the very last elected one has been
[19:31] baptized
[19:32] galatians 1 8 but though we or an
[19:35] angel from heaven preach any other
[19:37] gospel unto you than that which we have
[19:39] preached unto you let him be accursed
[19:43] now some of you oneness people baptize
[19:45] wrong
[19:46] you baptize for regeneration as though
[19:48] being immersed in water
[19:49] saved you regeneration does not come by
[19:52] water
[19:53] it is a work of the spirit the man who
[19:55] by the holy ghost gave the command
[19:57] repent and be baptized everyone in the
[19:59] name of the lord jesus
[20:01] did not say that water regenerated he
[20:04] said it was only an evidence of a good
[20:06] conscience toward god
[20:08] that was all first peter 3 21
[20:12] the like figure where unto even baptism
[20:14] doth also now save us
[20:16] not the putting away of the filth of the
[20:18] flesh but the answer of a good
[20:19] conscience toward god
[20:21] by the resurrection of jesus christ i
[20:24] believe it
[20:25] if anyone has any false ideas that
[20:28] history can prove water baptism in any
[20:30] other way than in the name of the lord
[20:32] jesus christ
[20:33] i would advise you to read the histories
[20:34] and find out for yourself
[20:36] the following is a true record of a
[20:38] baptism which took place in rome
[20:40] a d 100 and was reproduced in time
[20:43] magazine december 5th
[20:45] 1955. the deacon raised his hand
[20:49] and publius deseas stepped through the
[20:51] baptistry door
[20:52] standing waist deep in the pool was
[20:54] marcus vasquez the wood cellar
[20:56] he was smiling as publius waded into the
[20:58] pool beside him
[21:00] cradies he asked credo responded publius
[21:05] i believe that my salvation comes from
[21:07] jesus the christ
[21:08] who was crucified under pontius pilate
[21:11] with him i
[21:11] died that with him i may have eternal
[21:13] life
[21:15] then he felt strong arms supporting him
[21:17] as he let himself fall backward into the
[21:19] pool
[21:19] and heard marcus voice in his ear i
[21:22] baptize you in the name of the lord
[21:23] jesus
[21:24] as the cold water closed over him
[21:28] right up until the truth was lost and
[21:30] did not return until this last age
[21:32] this is from nicaea till the turn of
[21:34] this century they baptized in the name
[21:36] of the lord jesus christ
[21:39] but it has come back satan can't keep
[21:41] the revelation down when the spirit
[21:43] wants to give it
[21:44] yes if there were three gods you might
[21:46] very well baptize for a father and a son
[21:49] and a holy ghost
[21:50] but the revelation given to john was
[21:52] that there is one god
[21:54] and his name is lord jesus christ and
[21:57] you baptize for one god and only one
[22:00] that is why peter baptized the way he
[22:02] did at pentecost
[22:03] he had to be true to the revelation
[22:05] which was let
[22:07] all the house of israel know assuredly
[22:09] that god hath made that same
[22:11] jesus whom ye have crucified both lord
[22:14] and
[22:14] christ there he is the lord jesus christ
[22:19] if jesus is both lord and christ then he
[22:22] jesus is and cannot be else but father
[22:26] son and holy ghost in one person
[22:28] manifested in the flesh
[22:30] it is not god in three persons blessed
[22:33] trinity
[22:34] but one god one person with three major
[22:37] titles
[22:38] with three offices manifesting those
[22:39] titles hear it once more
[22:42] this same jesus is both lord and christ
[22:45] lord father and christ holy spirit are
[22:48] jesus
[22:49] for he jesus is both of them lord and
[22:52] christ if that doesn't show us the true
[22:55] revelation of the godhead nothing will
[22:58] lord is not another one christ is not
[23:00] another one
[23:02] this jesus is the lord jesus christ one
[23:05] god
[23:06] philip one day said to jesus lord show
[23:09] us the father and it will suffice us
[23:11] jesus said unto him have i been so long
[23:14] with you and you don't know me
[23:16] he that has seen me has seen the father
[23:19] so why do you say
[23:20] show us the father i and my father are
[23:23] one
[23:24] i quoted that once and a lady said just
[23:27] a minute mr branham you and your wife
[23:28] are one
[23:29] i said not that kind she said
[23:32] i beg your pardon so i said to her do
[23:35] you see
[23:36] me she said yes i said
[23:39] do you see my wife she said no
[23:42] i said then that oneness is a different
[23:45] kind
[23:46] for he said when you see me you see the
[23:48] father
[23:50] the prophet said that it would be light
[23:51] at the evening time
[23:53] in the hymn it is written it'll be light
[23:56] in the evening time
[23:57] the path to glory you will surely find
[23:59] in the waterway that's the light today
[24:02] buried in the precious name of jesus
[24:05] young and old repent of all your sin
[24:07] the holy ghost will surely enter in the
[24:10] evening light has come
[24:12] it is a fact that god and christ are one
[24:16] not too long ago i was talking to a
[24:17] jewish rabbi
[24:19] he said to me you gentiles can't cut god
[24:22] in three pieces and give him to a jew
[24:24] we know better than that i said to him
[24:27] that's just it rabbi we don't cut god in
[24:30] three pieces
[24:31] you believe the prophets don't you he
[24:33] said certainly i do
[24:35] do you believe isaiah 9 6 yes
[24:38] who was the prophet speaking of messiah
[24:42] i said what relation will messiah be to
[24:45] god
[24:46] he said he will be god i said
[24:49] that's right amen you can't put god into
[24:54] three persons or three parts
[24:56] you can't tell a jew that there is a
[24:58] father and a son and a holy ghost
[25:00] he will tell you right quick where that
[25:02] idea came from
[25:03] the jews know this creed was established
[25:05] at the nicene council
[25:07] no wonder they scorn us as heathen
[25:10] we talk about a god that does not change
[25:13] the jews believe that too
[25:15] but the church changed its unchanging
[25:17] god from one to three
[25:19] but the light is returning at even tide
[25:22] how striking it is that this truth has
[25:24] come at the time when the jews are
[25:25] returning to palestine
[25:27] god and christ are one this jesus is
[25:30] both lord and christ
[25:33] john had the revelation and jesus was
[25:35] the revelation
[25:37] and he produced himself right here in
[25:38] the scripture i
[25:40] am he that was which is and shall come
[25:43] the almighty amen
[25:47] if revelation is beyond you look up and
[25:49] seek god for it
[25:51] that is the only way you are ever going
[25:53] to get it a revelation has to come from
[25:56] god it never comes by human natural
[25:59] endowments but by spiritual endowment
[26:01] you can even memorize this scripture and
[26:03] though that is wonderful that won't do
[26:05] it
[26:06] it has to be a revelation from god it
[26:08] says in the word
[26:10] that no man can say that jesus is the
[26:12] christ except by the holy ghost
[26:14] you have to receive the holy ghost and
[26:16] then and only then
[26:17] can the spirit give you the revelation
[26:19] that jesus is the christ
[26:21] god the anointed one no man knows the
[26:25] things of god save the spirit of god
[26:27] and he to whom the spirit of god reveals
[26:29] them we need to call on god for
[26:31] revelation more than anything else in
[26:33] the world
[26:34] we have accepted the bible we have
[26:36] accepted the great truths of it
[26:38] but it still is not real to most people
[26:41] because the revelation by the spirit is
[26:42] not there
[26:44] the word has not been quickened the
[26:46] bible says
[26:47] in second corinthians 5 21 that we have
[26:50] become the righteousness of god
[26:52] by our union with jesus christ did you
[26:54] get it
[26:55] it says that we are the very
[26:57] righteousness of god himself by being
[27:00] in christ it says that he jesus
[27:04] became sin for us it does not say he
[27:06] became sinful
[27:08] but became sin for us that by our union
[27:10] with him we might become the
[27:12] righteousness of god
[27:14] if we accept the fact and we must that
[27:16] he literally became sin for us by his
[27:19] substitution
[27:20] for us then we must also accept the fact
[27:23] that we by our union with him have
[27:25] become the very righteousness of god
[27:28] to reject one is to reject the other to
[27:30] accept the one is to accept the other
[27:33] now we know the bible says that it can't
[27:36] be denied
[27:37] but the revelation of it is missing it
[27:39] is not real to the majority of god's
[27:41] children
[27:42] it is just a good verse in the bible but
[27:45] we need to have it made alive to us
[27:48] that will take revelation let me drop in
[27:52] something here that will both amaze and
[27:54] help you
[27:54] there is hardly a student that does not
[27:56] believe the new testament was originally
[27:58] in the greek language
[28:00] all are great bible students have said
[28:02] that god gave the world three great
[28:04] nations with three great contributions
[28:06] for the sake of the gospel
[28:08] he gave the greeks who gave a universal
[28:10] language
[28:11] he gave us the jews who gave us the true
[28:14] religion and true knowledge of god
[28:15] through the savior
[28:17] he gave us the romans who gave us a
[28:19] unified empire with law and a system of
[28:21] highways
[28:23] thus we have true religion the language
[28:25] to express it to many peoples
[28:27] and the government and roads to spread
[28:29] it physically
[28:30] and historically speaking this seems to
[28:32] be exactly right
[28:34] and today our greek scholars say that
[28:36] the greek language of bible days is so
[28:38] perfect and exact
[28:40] that if the student of the greek is a
[28:42] refined and accurate grammarian
[28:44] he can truly know exactly what the new
[28:46] testament word teaches
[28:48] but is this not only a theory is this
[28:50] true
[28:51] is it not so that every greek scholar of
[28:53] repute from one denomination debates
[28:55] another student of another denomination
[28:58] and is it not so that their arguments
[29:00] are based on identical greek words and
[29:02] identical rules of grammar
[29:04] certainly that is the way it is even
[29:06] back there in the pergam age
[29:08] just prior to the nicene council of 325
[29:11] there were two great students arius and
[29:13] athanasius
[29:14] who became locked in doctrinal combat
[29:16] over a greek word
[29:18] so intense and so worldwide did their
[29:20] debate become that historians said the
[29:22] world was divided over a diphthong
[29:25] the sound of two vowels in a single
[29:27] syllable
[29:28] now if the greek is so perfect and so
[29:30] ordained of god
[29:31] why was there such a dispute surely god
[29:34] did not intend us all to know the greek
[29:37] right today we are having arguments over
[29:39] the greek take for instance the book
[29:41] christ's paralyzed church x-rayed by dr
[29:44] mcrossen
[29:46] in it he sets forth numerous quotes from
[29:48] many renowned greek grammarians
[29:50] and proves to his own satisfaction that
[29:52] the unchanging rules of greek grammar
[29:54] prove conclusively that the bible
[29:56] teaches a man is baptized with the holy
[29:58] ghost subsequent to rebirth
[30:00] he also states flatly that women can
[30:02] take over the pulpit because the word
[30:04] prophesy means to preach
[30:06] but has he convinced other students of
[30:08] the greek who are as able as he
[30:10] never all you have to do is read those
[30:12] students who hold the opposite view and
[30:14] hear their learned quotes
[30:17] now not only is what i have just said
[30:19] true but let us go a step further
[30:22] today we have some students who claim
[30:24] that the original manuscripts were
[30:25] written in the aramaic
[30:27] which was the language of jesus and the
[30:28] people of his day
[30:30] it is claimed by them that the people
[30:32] did not speak and write in the greek as
[30:34] is so commonly supposed
[30:36] and the fact is our historians are
[30:38] divided on that
[30:39] for example dr schoenfield a most
[30:42] brilliant student has from research
[30:44] proved to his satisfaction that the new
[30:46] testament was written in the vernacular
[30:47] of the greek speaking people of that day
[30:50] he builds up a fine case for his beliefs
[30:52] based on the various documents
[31:09] [Music]
[31:16] so
[31:19] [Music]
[31:24] you
