Yes, we'll gather at the river, the beautiful, beautiful river. Gather with the saints at the river that flows from the throne of God on the margin of the river washing up its silver spray. We will walk and worship ever all the happy golden day. Yes, we'll gather at the river, the beautiful, beautiful river. Gather with the saints at the river that flows from the throne of God.

Gather with the saints at the river that flows by the throne of God. Let's put our hands together for Jesus this morning. Hallelujah. And thank you for praying for brother Joel's family. praying that we can be a comfort and blessing to them at this time of their loss. Uh Joel went home in victory so we can rejoice. That's from sister Naomi. God bless you. Let's put our hands together for Jesus. We want to pray for brother Jo's uh family as they go through their period of bereiement. We'll call on brother Dan. God bless you, brother Dan, to give us opening prayer. And he has a testimony. Yeah. All right. Shall we pray? our Lord and our Savior Jesus. We are so grateful once again that you have gathered us by your feet, oh God, that we may bring our praise and our worship unto thee, oh God, knowing that in return, you are going to minister unto us. We know that we'll continue doing this until one day we do it no more. We just thank you so much for having ordered our steps before thee. That this path we have chosen is not actually our choice. You have chosen and ordained unto us, Lord. And we are so grateful that we have found favor in your sight to have come this far by grace. And we give you the glory this morning, Father. And we bless your holy name and we worship you in the name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior. Father, we commit ourselves into your hands as we have guided Lord that you'll come and be with us during the course of today's service. Lord, let our praise rise unto thee as a sweet smelling order, acceptable in thine sight. And Father, we pray, touch every heart in a very special way. Do not let us leave your presence the way we have come. We have just begun the year. We don't know the surprises that are waiting for us, but we are so grateful to know that we are not in this alone. Father, our lives are in your hands. Do with us as it pleases thee. Do not let our adversary, the devil, ever have his way. We want to commit sis Naomi and entire family into your hands. Lord during this time of difficulty father even know when we know our loved ones where we know our loved ones are going the fact that we are just parting company is not an easy feeling father we pray may you comfort them give them strength to cope with the passing away of brother Joel Father brother Ben is not here with us with his family. He called this morning to tell me he wasn't feeling fine and he wouldn't be here. We lift him before you and we pray that you will send your holy angels to go and minister strength unto him and entire family. Be with us, Father, and see us through. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you saints. Good to see every one of you. Uh the year has come to an end and uh we have started a new one. Um I just want to take this opportunity to thank every one of you, every brother, every sister um for working with us. We know it doesn't matter how much Holy Ghost you have in you. The fact that we are in this flesh will always have our differences. We always have our opinions. We always have our way that would vary one from the other. We may have conflicts here and there. I personally do not believe in a church without problem. I don't believe that. And I don't think you do either. Praise the Lord. But what I do believe in though that when there is a problem, we should be able to solve it peacefully. That after all is said and done, we can put our hands around each other and say, "God bless you." So if during the course of the previous year there was anything we did that was not up to your satisfaction, there was anything we did that you thought was not right. If we stepped on your toes in one way or the other, we pray forgive us because once we are in the office, you have chosen I mean you chose us to serve you and we are serving you the best way we can but we'll make mistakes during during during the course of our services to you. I do reckon that we have a small place and sometimes you come in, you are comfortably seated and we have to locate you. It's not an easy feeling and I know sometimes it hasn't gone very well. Praise the Lord. But you are coping with us, coping with the situation and bearing with us, mothers with children and fathers also. In fact, you need to be recommended as a matter of fact because a lot of the time before we even come in, I mean, if the child is fussy or maybe, you know, disturbing, you get them out there, you know, just to create that atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to move and then be a blessing to every one of us. And um that uh we do we do commend you for that. God richly bless you and um the musicians um all the various offices in the church, the those in the sound room, God bless you richly. Uh if there is anything we can do better to save you better than we have ever done, please let us know. If it is not something against the word, we'll try to do it if we can. I think all of us has have a lot on our plates. Uh not to take too much of your time but just to let you know that we appreciate every one of you uh coming through the doors, those that are cleaning the place uh the brother and the sisters that are cleaning the place. So every time we come the place is clean, the toilet, the foyer, every place. Uh these are things we don't ever take for granted and we don't overlook those things. God richly bless you, you know, at his own time. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. So, um, yes, I think that, um, I don't want to eat too much of the time. I have a testimony, but I'm even going to compress it because we are running out of time. Yesterday was our 28th wedding anniversary, and uh, praise the Lord. And uh my wife and I were just talking one thing from the other, you know, recapturing the head this and uh a whole lot of things that has happened. And we just agreed that it is the Lord who has brought us this far &gt;&gt; and it is only God because the devil started fighting the marriage before we even came together during the wedding. I mean after every single thing you can just see the devil's footprints and we just thank the almighty God that we have come this far by his grace. &gt;&gt; I mean um I love my wife so much and everybody knows she is my baby girl. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord. Yes. But I think one part that nobody knows is that I am also her proud baby boy. Nobody knows that. Yes. I remember one time I took ill and I was admitted to the hospital at St. Louis Park and she would be there at the hospital till almost midnight. She would go home and early the following morning between 5:00 and 6:00 she's at the hospital and I'll be lying on the bed and she comes and she's lying by the foot of the bed. &gt;&gt; I don't know what the nurses were saying behind the scenes but I knew they said something. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And in fact, it just tells you um how far the grace of God has brought us and how much uh we cherish her as a mom. She's a mother to all of us. And uh God richly bless you, baby girl, for not saying no the first day I came. I appreciate that. God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus this morning. All right, let's go ahead and stand as we um get ourselves ready for the song service this morning.

Praise the Lord. Amen. We thank the Lord for giving us a good service Wednesday night. We were able to hold up as long as we could. Sorry, I had to leave early because my body started shutting down and I felt like uh I needed to drive quickly and get home before I start sleeping at the gas station. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you, Sister Grace. Good to see you and sister believe that your brother is in a better place and our prayers for the family. Yes. So, sister brother Fra will be on Tuesday. For those that will be able to would like to be part of it, you just get in contact with us. We'll give you the address and uh we try to come out and support the family. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. This morning, we want to try something. Uh we've been thinking on what uh we would do for for the kids in our our Sunday school. Uh so what we what we came up with and we just want to do uh you know uh uh in in the in the when you are a driver they tell you you have to go and do uh a drive run. The drive run is you have to drive and pass to all your all your turns all the place you're going to drop off and you going to pick up and uh so you go with an empty bus and you just go and do a drive. But this morning we will not go with an empty bus and uh uh we spoke to sister Naomi. So sorry we spoke to sister Na and asked that uh uh she would do there with us and and the kids back there. So all the little ones uh uh four five will go to the cry room and they will go for the form of introduction and different things. We just want to see how that will work. uh it's is so difficult sharing the building before the service begin and uh so what we want to do is that whenever we come and before the preacher start preaching we would dismiss the kids and they will go back there and and be able to spend 30 35 minutes as much time as uh the teacher can be able to teach as much time as the children can be able to bear. So uh we thought that we would just give a try and see how it is. Uh if it starts to become too noisy, maybe we will cut the service shut so they can have their time or we will ask them to uh to keep quiet. Praise the Lord. But once again, we want to say happy new year to every one of you. And uh like brother Dan said, thank you brother Dan uh for your uh words of appreciation. We we thank each and every one of you that call this place church and uh and is part of this uh family at the corner of this street and we we thank you for coming bringing your family and uh Wednesday night it's Sunday morning and every time we ask you to come uh you come and and support what we are doing here. We are very very grateful. Very very grateful. We are looking forward to what this year will bring for us. Praise the Lord. We are looking forward to what this year will bring. But uh we know that the Lord is having good things in store for his children. Praise the Lord. He's having good things in store for his children. So, and uh uh so just like we said, we will have uh all the all the little ones uh uh from uh four, five years old um up to maybe about 10 years or nine. We'll go back there and be with sister Naomi as soon as we get into the preaching of the word. Sister Naomi, be with sister. Praise the Lord. Uh I try to keep you out of this thing, Sister D. I knew that uh you were you were busy and yet you keep coming up. Praise the Lord. But we thank the Lord. Let's stand on our feet. Let's sing that song again. We are together again just praising the Lord. Amen. We know that uh something good is going to happen because God always have something good in store for us. Something good to happen. Something good God is good. We are together again just praising the Lord. Oh, we are together again. &gt;&gt; Just praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are together again. We are again in one call. Oh, something good about to happen. something new. God got it. We are together again. &gt;&gt; Just praising the Lord. Oh, we are together again. &gt;&gt; We are together again. &gt;&gt; Just praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are together again. &gt;&gt; We are together again. Yeah. One night. Oh, something good is going to happen. Something good. God is strong. We are together again. &gt;&gt; Just praising the one more time. There we are together again. &gt;&gt; We are together again. &gt;&gt; Just praising the power. &gt;&gt; We are together again. Something good about you have been something good. We are together again. &gt;&gt; Just praising the Lord. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And I told uh our sister that uh you know children they are just like uh children they are children when when they see one going they all want to go and I think that's why Joseph was crying because uh his mama is thinking special and and the other kids are coming up and they deny him from coming to sink with his mother. You allow Joseph to come and sing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You allow little Joseph to come and sing. He's uh he's uh he's one of uh one of the worshippers here with us. Praise the Lord. So, amen. Let's take our Bibles. Let's take our Bibles. Uh we have gone much into our time this morning and uh Praise the Lord. We want to go to uh uh Proverb chapter 27. Proverb 27. Proverb 27. We going to read the verse. Amen. Let's read verse 17. Proverb 27. We will read verse 17. Iron sharpenth iron. So a man sharpenth the countenance of his frame. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we read that together? Iron sharpened iron. &gt;&gt; So a man sharpened the countenance of his friend. Praise the Lord. Philippians chapter 3. Philippians chapter 3. We'll read from verse 13. Brethrens, I count myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which I behind, and reaching for onto those things which are before. I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded. And if in anything ye be otherwise mounded, God shall reveal even this unto you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hands together. Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, we just want to thank you for giving us this time that we can come together, Lord, want to uh uh honor the resurrection and appreciate you, Father God, that you are the risen Christ that living in our hearts. And Lord God, uh uh also this is the first Sunday of the new year. We want to use this Lord as a dedication to you. And we say Lord take a hold of our hands oh God. Father, we as we said commonly, Lord, we don't know what this year holds, but we know you the whole time in eternity in your hands. And that's the reason why, Father, we want to use this service and just commit ourself in your hands, Lord. And Lord, we want to place our hands in your hands to ask your guidance, to ask your leadership, to ask, oh God, your grace and mercy. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Father God, for everyone that is streaming in uh uh this morning, Lord God, that are not able to be with us, brother not feeling well and uh his family, Lord, Sister Rachel also God recovering. We pray that father your grace will be with them Lord Jesus and even the other ones Lord gather that aching in your body that father we may not know but God father Lord you know Lord because you are touched by the feelings of our infirmities. So Lord we appreciate you this morning. I commit myself in your hands this morning for strength. And I pray that God you would just uh come and just bless us now, Father. The little thought on our heart that we want to share with your children, oh God, give us inspiration. Give us, Lord, Father, an uncction that only comes from you, Lord Jesus. And oh God, Father, we pray that you would capture us away this morning. We thank you for the songs that were sung, the prayers, Lord, Father, the testimony. Bless brother Dian and sister Fatu. Oh God, we pray father Lord continuously Lord Jesus for their voice that you will God father redeem them from their own trouble. And Lord Father, oh God, we pray for all of our young people, oh God, we commit them into your hands. What an awesome God you are. What a wonderful father. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray with faith and thanksgiving in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Amen. You may have your seat. And uh it's good to have Sister Elizabeth in church. And uh so praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. So, just like I said, let let all the little ones uh go out uh the ones that fall in their age bracket, they can they can fire out and and go to meet Sister Naisha back there. And uh so you can introduce yourself to your to yourself. and uh Samuel Grace redeem Karen you're far out. You go back there you go you go enjoy yourself go introduce yourself to yourself. Praise the Lord. Amen. Yeah. We really been leaving the kids out and we've really been thinking what we can do. So we hope that that work when they can be able to spend just few minutes and then they will come back to their parents uh in the middle of the service. We hope we'll be able to manage it until the Lord can be able to bless us and give us uh uh the space that we need. This morning I want I want to speak on something and uh uh I want to do the best that I can to be to be a bit direct uh since I'm not always direct. I always speaking in in parables and trying to help you to figure it out. But this morning I want to I want to speak on something and I will I will read from the message context and uh that's where I I'm taking my my thought from this uh morning. So from the message context, brother Brandham I think that was uh de December 31st message. He was preaching the end of the year. Uh uh so I want to take that and and then uh start start with us this morning. Now this great context has has been going on for many years. It started in heaven and Satan was kicked out into the earth and then he became an enemy to God's people and since then he used all of his strength and his strategy to try to pull God's people across the fire or into his fire. Praise the Lord. Brother Brandon is talking about base. He's he's uh he's presenting it almost like a talk. You know, he's pulling us and we pulling and uh uh uh we're not supposed to pull on him and we're just supposed to allow him to pull and then leave the rope. Let he fall back. you know if you if you remember the game of talks now so he goes on here and he says and we know that who has the most power God does and God when he gave his people the best thing that he could do uh that that that he could to come back certain way was um his his word now because the word is God and God and and who's stronger than God? So the word is God and the word became our becomes our strength. Praise the Lord. The word becomes our strength. God in his church becomes its strength to pull Satan into his own fire that he has made. And the talk goes on. Now Jesus said in Mark 16, "In my name, they shall cast out devils." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People don't believe in demons in this day. But the thing to do to my opinion is to know your enemy. and know your enemy and train for the context that you are going to have when you meet him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh uh if uh uh uh I don't think anyone of anyone yet is my enemy. The devil is mine. Praise the Lord. And I think that should be the same for every one of us. uh the only enemy we have is is the devil. So uh that's what we want to look at a little bit. Brother Brandham is going to bring this subject more like a boxer that is preparing for the fight. So uh normally what they would do is that with every sport they will sit down and uh and then they will watch series of games. they will watch series of games of their opponent just to know how the guys move and all of that. I was looking at a little little uh uh uh just a kind of a short video and uh and and this this young uh uh football player, American football player took his little boy to their practice session and while the coach were talking, they were watching the game of their opponent and uh you know how they were balanced and how they were tackled and all of that and the young guy was sitting down with his pencil and he was also watching the But then he will see that uh uh the runner or the quarterback what uh whatever is his title, he will always tack his shoulder. You know, it looks like he's taking dirt from his shoulder, but he's telling his guys that he's about to run and they should send him the ball. And while they were watching the game, none of them pick it up beside the little boy. &gt;&gt; Okay? You know, so the little boy talk in the practice which of course he shouldn't have talked because he's not part of the team. He's just there hanging out with his older brother. He says, "Uh, but he always knock his shoulder." So his brother said, "Keep quiet. Keep quiet." But the coach caught up to it and says, "What you said?" said, "Rewind the tape. If you watch every time, he knocks his shoulder." And and they rewind the tape. and uh and he found out that uh there was that was a language that he was using and it was only the little boy that caught it and everybody eyes was on him during the game. Everybody eyes was looking for that little knock you know no matter how he did it they knew that he was running and they tie him down and and and it's and it's the same thing that brother Brandham is trying to bring to us here. So let's continue to read. And uh know your enemy and train for the context that you are going to have when you meet him because you are going to meet him. Know his strength and train for this context when uh when you do meet him for in for it's one thing show you are going to meet him and so you train for the context. Now training for a context is just like a boxer. His enemy that he's going to meet out there in a context to fight a real good fighter usually know and steady his opponent. He steady his legs. You know how he throw on a cotton on on top carton what is whatever it is. No word he uh h where he fights for whether he leans forward or he hangs back or he fights right hand or left hand he study all this and then if if he's a good a smart fighter he get himself aspiring partner &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; that's the title of our message inspiring ing partner. If you are a good fighter, brother Bam said you're going to get yourself a spiring partner. &gt;&gt; And this spiring partner is your partner, but he's going to be the one that you will use to train. Even though he's your sparring partner, but he's going to he's going to behave like your opponent. So, he's not going to be the guy that would just pat you on the back. Uh uh I mean, he's going to wear his gloves and uh and his knocks are going to be real, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Even though he's your partner, &gt;&gt; but he's going to hit you so real. &gt;&gt; And know I I put a little bit of uh uh 6 seconds smith, brother Brandham talk about his trainer, 6 seconds smith. He asked the guy and he says, "Why are you hitting me like that?" He says, "Because uh you know, I'm training you so you can be able to to know what what a blow feels like." &gt;&gt; He said, "This guy will hit him and he will go over the rink and fall on the other side." He's supposed to be training him, but that is the way he wanted to train him. He said, "So your body can get used to the shock of a knock. when the when the opponent knock you, your body will get used to it. But if if I'm just jumping around with you, you know, uh so uh that's what we want to talk about. And like I said, I want to I want to just be a little bit frank with you that I'm needing aspiring partner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm needing aspiring partner. And I think we all need aspiring partner. Praise the Lord. If we going to stay in this this fight, we need a sparring partner. And I believe that the Holy Ghost is has been our spiring partner all of these years. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he condemn us when we are wrong. I don't believe that he compromised on his word. No, he do not compromise on his word. He's going to call you out. You know, he's going to beat your conscience. is going to uh uh uh uh uh send uh some uh some sense of uh uh uh um uh guilty feeling. Uh he tried to get your attention and then if you are not listening sometimes uh you know uh maybe he allow you to get sick and uh he's he's doing all of this just to be able to get your attention that look you you need to focus. This is a real life thing. Amen. We are in a real life uh uh fight here with with a devil that does not want any good from us. So this morning we want to talk about aspiring partner. Let me get back there and and continue my reading. And then if he's a good a smart fighter, he get himself a sparring partner that will fight just like his opponent's fight for he will know all the legs when he gets to that place. And I think that is a very good thing for Christians to do. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is a good thing for Christians to do. But that is that is not uh you know the most thing that we do. We always try to find you know the partner or somebody you know that we can we can have uh uh uh some form of mutual agreement where we we turn to be nice to one another. The moment we start criticizing one another then the friendship you know breaks apart. Praise the Lord. Amen. And uh but uh we we we are learning here this morning that we need aspiring partner and uh that we fight just like our opponents will fight and uh uh and and that's a very good thing for Christians to do. That's right. And now if you want to start training, start with John 3:16. Amen. John 3:16. For God so loved the world. So you start with love. Amen. You have to know that you and this person you're a partner. The person is not your enemy. So you have to love them. Praise the Lord. Amen. And then he says the next thing there you start with the golden rule. What is the golden rule? Do unto others &gt;&gt; as you want them to do unto you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So as you're at training, you know, do unto him as you want him to do unto you. So I mean uh if you just pat one another on the back, you're going to yell because uh y'all will not know what a real blow is. Amen. Yeah. So you give him give him a good hit and uh uh when he wake up, he will do the same unto you. When he do it to you, don't cry. Amen. Because that's your partner. You are training for the fight. So uh uh the first thing to start with is uh John 3:16, love in our hearts. And then the golden rule, start right out with that and that will get you on the floor. Praise the Lord. And then train for the knockout punches because you are going to have to use them. Everybody knows that. Amen. You have to train to hit your enemy. And always God use his word. We re we must remember. We must remember that God use his word to defeat his enemy. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He used his word to defeat his enemy. So when you when when we look at this subject that we want to look at, we realize that uh uh as we have said over and over, God plan of redemption has has has been a long plan before the foundation of the world. He had this plan of redemption. But in the plan of redemption, the reason why God made us because he needed spiring partners. &gt;&gt; He couldn't do it on his own. &gt;&gt; He needed us to be his partners. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He need spiring partners. That's the reason why Moses could say to God, brother Brandon will say here in the message, look away to Jesus. There was another one that puzzled me. That that was when Moses could tell God a better way &gt;&gt; then God knows how to do anything. When Moses said the people will say your God, you see Moses Moses correction to God was not the people will say I'm not strong. He was not talking about himself. Amen. He was trying to uphold the repetition of his partner. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you kill us in the wilderness, all of these nations around will say you you are I mean what kind of a god is this? You are not able to keep the people. That's why you killed him. So you see the spiring partner is always looking after the the the interest of the other one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He want the other one to be better. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So uh so this whole plan of redemption as we are going to look into uh this morning uh uh uh is a plan that God have. But it's a plan in in his plan he also planned to have partners. He also planned to have sparring partners. That's the reason why when he made man, he made man in his image because he want his partner to be as good as he was. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, we're going to talk on partnership this uh this morning &gt;&gt; because that's what I think we need to run this church. &gt;&gt; We need partnership. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And uh uh I think that's what we need to be able to run our homes. That's what we need to be able to to become successful. We need partnership. Praise the Lord. No man is an island. Praise the Lord. I need you as much as you need me. Praise the Lord. Or maybe even more than you need me. And uh uh uh so that's what we're going to look at uh for the few minutes that is before us. We want to look at partnership. Praise the Lord. We want to look at partnership and we will we will if we are not able as uh to finish as usual we might take a series on it. Then you know there's the rest of 2026. Amen. Praise the Lord. Because when I start I don't finish so easily unless uh we have uh visitors then they they take me out of my stories. Now so uh we want to talk about sparring partners. We want to talk about spiring partners and and brother Bam go on here and he talks you know on and on and on but but that's that's where that's where the thought is that's what we want to look at this morning. We want to look at sparring partners. And uh when God expressed himself in making man, he made man male and female. Eve was Adam helpmate. Praise the Lord. Uh uh she was a uh he was a helpmate. He was a helpmate to uh to Adam. And uh so being a helpmate uh she was a partner. She was a partner and and I think also she was aspiring partner. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought the little one was coming to be my partner to preach this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I was saying we didn't drink together. I don't know how it's going to be. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Oh man, it's so so wonderful this morning. Now, so she was uh she was a helpmate and and I think that word we have play with it. help me. Help me. And uh we have you know we have played with it in uh uh you know in in so many different ways that sometimes uh we we we lost the sense of what really it means. And uh uh and I've been looking I've been looking into something that I tried to bring out in one of the services but I didn't do a good job. And I kept studying on the subject and I would like to go into it a little bit this morning hoping that uh uh maybe this time the Lord will be able to help us so we can be able to look at that because when God made man, he made man uh uh uh in his image, male and female. Praise the Lord. Amen. And uh uh as as believers, message believers, we are very uh uh used to that statement of brother Brandon. The woman was not in the original creation of God. She was not in the original manifestation of the creation. But she was in the original creation because he made man male and female. Praise the Lord. But when he was expressing that uh that uh uh image that he made, she was not there. She was in man in Genesis 2 uh 7. So uh uh um but if you look all through the ages you will see that God have always whenever he raise up a man he always have someone there as as a sparring partner. Praise the Lord. He always have somebody there as a sparring partner. Uh uh praise the Lord. He had uh he had an Enoch just after Eden. He raised a man up there that that could walk with God. He had a sparring partner, Noah, because Noah was watching Enoch. And uh when Enoch leave, he knew that the flood was going to come. So Noah and Enoch were pretty much in the same dis dispensation. If you want to look at it like that, uh uh uh and Abraham had a spiring partner which was Eleazar. And at one time he called his partner. He says, "Buddy, I want you to go and get a wife for my son." And uh uh he was a boy that grew up right in in Abraham house. But he turned out to be a spiring partner because uh uh he was able to carry out exactly what Abraham needed. Moses had aspiring partner that was his older brother Aaron. Aaron was his mouthpiece. Praise the Lord. Aaron was his mouthpiece and Joshua had a sparring partner and that was Caleb. Now, so in in the Pagamos church, Abraham will say something like this about Joshua and Kaleb. He says, "Now let's let let uh let let us stand like Joshua and Caleb. Our promised land is coming in sight even as the date did." Now Joshua means Jehovah savior and he represented the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader. Praise the Lord. Amen. Who is that end time leader? The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the end time leader. Praise the Lord. The prophet brought us as much as Moses brought the people and he pointed to the promised land. Amen. That just how the uh the the the prophet brought us. He pointed us to the promise. He pointed us to the ter. He promised us to the manifestation of God and he told us go and take the land. Take the book and eat it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh the the Holy Ghost is our end time leader. Caleb represent those that stay uh uh truth with Joshua. Praise the Lord. Amen. So there was a Caleb and Joshua and both of them were aspiring partners. Praise the Lord. It came a time where Joshua came to uh Caleb came to Joshua and says, "Put it give me my mountain." Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If there is any other thing that I need to do to get that mountain, it was given to me. I need it. Praise the Lord. And the Bible say his strength was just like the strength of a young man. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm trying to gather my strength this morning and uh uh woke up around 4:00 a.m. this morning and I was I was I was I was trying to think where was I. Amen. I was thinking where was I? Amen. But uh thank you for your prayers. I'm feeling much better this morning and uh just just uh believing that God will will help us to get through this. So like we said in his plan of redemption uh uh God plan uh uh to have man as a as a sparring partner. He planned to have men as a spiring partner in the message of the unconditional covenant that God made with the people. He said, "Now, if you will notice what caused this great thing in the beginning, God took man for a partner." Praise the Lord. God took man. That word, let us made man in our image. God was making a partner. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was making a partner. God believe in partnership. &gt;&gt; The work of redemption is a work of partnership. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He paid the price on the cross of Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; He sent his spirit back to the church. Praise the Lord. And that's why brother Brandon would tell us lot of time we are waiting on God when God is waiting on us &gt;&gt; because in partnership I mean the work the work must be distributed equally. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We must also learn the abilities of one another. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We must learn the abilities of one another. You know why we believe uh in his ability there is nothing that he cannot do. But also in his word he told us that uh uh all things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; So he's showing us our you know uh our abilities and and and as as we also are discovering his ability in the word. So uh he took man for a partner and he made a covenant with man equal and told and told a man if thou shall do this and not do this then the man broke his covenant and he always breaks his covenant. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see in partnership is not just like you know you hire for the job and and you do something wrong and they say you are fired. No, I mean if you uh if you uh if you are not meeting up, we have to have a conference. Amen. Let's sit down. Let's review the values of uh of uh of our team. You know, let's talk about it. You know, how how we can help you to become better. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Those are the things that are in partnership. Amen. A man always breaks his he always break his covenant. A man just can't keep his promise. That's all. There's only one can keep his promise. That's God. Man cannot. He break his covenant every time with God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God we have we have a partner that is not giving up on us. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a partner that is not giving up on us. He he want us to be better. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He want us to be better. Whenever we fail, we can come back to him and says, "Well, I thought I got it, but this time I didn't get it, you know, and then he can be able to set us down and and take us through everything." And that is the beautiful thing about partnership. Praise the Lord. Yeah. So, let's just get right into it this morning. We're going to go right back again from the beginning. And this is what I this is what I like I said, I tried to bring to you and I and I I didn't get it right. And I want to try it again hoping that the Lord will be able to help us. Now, so when God express himself and wanting to make make man in his image, the Bible says uh Genesis 1 26:27, those were spirit men that God made male and female. And uh and in Genesis 2:7, that was where he made men out of the dust of the earth. Praise the Lord. But now this man that was made in Genesis 2:7, which of course was the man that was embodying what God made in Genesis 2:26 because what was made in 126 was just a spirit being. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And 27 was the was the was the physical body was the flesh that was made in 27. So uh uh then in 27 we realized that man was now uh he had uh uh uh both masculine and feminine spirit right in that same body. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and and and this is where I wanted to get to. If you if you look through the scripture, you will read that the Bible says it was God that said it was not good for the man to be alone. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was not Adam that came to God and say, "God, I'm tired of being alone." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now that's that's where I that's that's the thought I want you to grab because that thought is very very very very important. It was God that said it was not good for man to be alone. I will make him a helpmate. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that principle runs through the Bible. It was not Isaac that came to uh Abraham and says, "Father, I need a wife." Even though he needed a wife, but it was Abraham calling Eleazar and telling Eleazar, "Go and find a bride for my son." You also look in Jesus parable, you will see that Jesus every time he talks about the parable of the wedding supper, it was the father inviting people to the wedding of his son. It was never the son calling for a wedding. It was never the son is is the the thought is very very is very very strong. The thought is very deep. But we we we try to we work around it a little bit this morning. There's a reason why. There is a reason why. Because when God made man, he made man, male and female created he them in his image. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the woman was not in the image of the man. The woman was in the image of God as much as the man was in the image of God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's that is the thought that I want for us to get right from the beginning. You know, there's there's a whole lot of a thing in the scripture when when when you read the scripture, you see brother Brandon talking there in the invisible union. He says lot of time when we read Romans chapter 7 he says we tie it to our marriage condition. He said but Paul was not talking about our physical marriage condition. He was he was prophesying to the church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So it it was it was it was more of a prophecy and and lesser of our marriage condition. We can use it to be able to judge our home affairs and judge our marriage affairs in church. But there is more a prophecy than to our our physical union. Why? Because people in their physical union will disregard what Paul says in Romans CHAPTER 7. BUT GOD IN HIS internal purpose will never disregard it &gt;&gt; because it's his word. He's going to bring his church out because that is the way he thought about it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see this word that GOD GAVE TO US, IT IS NOT ONLY something for us to keep. GOD IS MORE DEVOTED to his word. HE'S MORE DEDICATED, MORE COMMITTED TO HIS word than we can. because it is his word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's having more stake in it than you and myself. &gt;&gt; Because he said in his word that his word will never return back to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO HE'S NOT JUST RELYING ON US BECAUSE HE KNOWS WITH OUR ABILITY WE CAN FAIL. &gt;&gt; So he's more COMMITTED THAT HIS WORD WILL NEVER FAIL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he having more stake in it than we can. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're talking aspiring partners. So we see here that uh God when he made this man and and uh and and then he he he had this thought and said it's not good for man to be alone. The Bible says he put the man to a deep sleep and then he he he brought out that uh uh uh feminine u uh nature out of the man and and he created a woman. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Adam recovered from his anesthesia. Praise the Lord. And he says, "This is flesh of my flesh and bones of my bones." and uh and I would call her woman. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But whenever God called them, he called them Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam called her woman, but God called them Adam. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, so, so this is the thought. This is the thought because this thought actually came out of uh uh uh spoken word is the original say when you when you when you study beard you will see that uh uh uh brother Brandon makes some very hard very very hard statement very tough statement and uh uh and and and one of the statement that he made that produced this thought that uh if Eve wouldn't have listened to the devil life she would have brought God, she will have had the virgin birth. Let me say it that way. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She will have had the virgin birth. Now, the virgin birth, there was no man that was involved. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, so you can see that God had a purpose for the woman. He had a purpose for the woman because even when she fell, EVEN WHEN HE FELL, WHAT DID GOD DO? HE COME BACK IN Genesis chapter 3 and he said the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent. SO WHICH MEAN THE THOUGHT OF THE VIRGIN BIRTH, THE THOUGHT OF GOD PRODUCING himself through THE WOMAN, GOD NEVER CAME, that was not an afterthought. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That was not a second thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WAS GOD'S PURPOSE RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE HAD INTEREST in creating a man and creating A WOMAN BECAUSE RIGHT HERE HE HAVING THIS BIG plan of redemption and he's UH HE'S LAYING OUT A PLAN THAT THIS GOD IS GOING TO DO AND A PLAN THAT THIS GU is going TO DO. WE ALL have a work to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT WAS EVE? EVE AS A HELPMATE, WHAT WAS HER JOB TO DO? What was her work? &gt;&gt; They were not wearing clothes. So there was no dirt clothes to watch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were not hungry. They were eating from the from the from the the fruits and the plants and everything they were eating. So I mean there was no stove and utensil for her to cook. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what was her work as an helpmate? SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP Adam in expressing God. THERE WAS A PART THAT ADAM COULD NOT DO BECAUSE THE FALL COULD NOT COME THROUGH ADAM. ADAM COULD NEVER REVE GOD AS A HEALER. HE COULD NEVER REVE GOD AS A DELIVERER. HE COULD NEVER REVE GOD AS A SAVIOR. THE WOMAN WAS DESIGNED TO DO THAT. WHY? BECAUSE THROUGH HER THE fall will come. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; I I spoke a little bit on this back there in South Africa and I kind of make a disclaimer that I was not preaching a new doctrine to cause problem in people home. Amen. And that's uh and that's not what I'm doing here either. My responsibility is to is to preach the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to make us to be able to see things in the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Make us to be able to see things in the word. You know when a person grab their position in the word and they know that uh God has called them for the purpose. There are many men that have left their wives and their wives stay serving God. &gt;&gt; There are many women that have left their husband and their husbands stay serving God. If it was just in a place that uh you know our marriage vow is to is is is to influence us in a way where when I stopped coming to church and then my wife stopped coming to church then you see that is the reason why God when when when he when he express himself that way he he broke the responsibility. Praise the Lord. He broke the responsibility. That's the reason why he did it because uh the man by his nature, God was going to find a way to express himself through the man. The woman BY HER NATURE, GOD WAS GOING TO EXPRESS. HE WAS NOT going to use the man to express himself through the woman. No, he was going to express himself through the woman by himself. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is the reason why it is not Adam finding the bride. It's not Isaac finding the bride, but it's God bringing A HELPMATE. GOD BRINGING A PARTNER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He's bringing a partner because there is a bigger picture. There's a bigger plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because many times and most of the time our our marriage plans begin selfish. We all &gt;&gt; they start selfish. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we we we turn to become much of ourself. We say marriage is the institute of God. We leave God. We we we we catch up with God later. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We catch up with God later. And then uh uh uh it's it's all about our self you know we we we want this person to give us the taste that we want. We want this person to give us the look that we want. We we be we make it too much and it's natural. I'm not saying there's nothing wrong with that. It's it's nature. That's what our human nature gave us. Our human nature gave us selfishness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a good selfishness and there is a destructive selfishness. &gt;&gt; Where did I took that from? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's a good selfishness. Take care. Brush your teeth. That's a good selfishness. Brush your teeth. That's your own teeth. Clean it, please. For it's not falling off. Amen. Is that not a good selfishness? &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; Oh man. Thank you people for bearing with me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory be to God. Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know, while I was there in in in South Africa, I I had that my image I've been using here paramed image. So I I decided to use one day because I realized that uh my friend he was not backing there and he was not finding another preacher. He's going to use me for all of the service. So I said okay I think I'm going to create a relaxing way to preach. So I told him I says get me a pointer. He says okay. So he went down to one Chinese shop and bought one. I said, "I'm there something I want to I want to I want to teach this morning." So, I came and then uh I make a disclaimer to the church and I say, "I'm not a teacher, but I just want to try something. There's something I've been doing in church and uh uh uh and to me it's been helpful for the church. So, I just want to try this morning." So uh I use uh I used the both services morning and evening to be able to do that. So I mean I would just relax myself and then the next day I can I can continue preaching. So then the next morning this sister came to me one of the brothers preacher's wife and and she says oh bless you brother one I said God bless you. She says uh you know yesterday you were you make a disclaimer that you are not a teacher but I think I have seen a teacher. Praise the Lord. She said I think I have seen a teacher. I said no sister I'm not a teacher. She said yeah for you you are not a teacher but me I have seen the teacher. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So in my head I'm saying if you know how many times I went over this thing with my church to be to be able to know how to present it, you would not call me a teacher. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh we just thank the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for bearing with me and uh praying for me and all of that. But let's get back to our subject because uh it's uh it's very important. Amen. Many men try to stand and and you know you hear brother Brandham using this statement which of course people take out of context and uh uh people take out of context and um oh praise the Lord. Amen. proof of his resurrection. He says uh and if we can and and and and if we had to stand it alone stand it for is God's word, &gt;&gt; every man that ever get anywhere &gt;&gt; had to stand alone on his conviction on it. &gt;&gt; Not standing alone but standing alone on his conviction. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that conviction can only survive if it is based on the word of God. &gt;&gt; If you have a conviction, you say that's your conviction. Good for you. If it is not the word of God, it's just a matter of time. It's going to crash. &gt;&gt; It's going to fall apart. Or but you hear people say, you know, brother Bam says, every man I ever did anything for God have to stand alone. So I'm standing alone. You can't be alone. &gt;&gt; You know what the world would be if you were just the only person living on earth? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You will run all the time from your shadow. So it's not it's not just producing uh uh uh ind uh uh uh uh uh some form of independence where we can just be alone you know stay by ourself and you know uh h uh run our own thing you know in uh in uh in in our home and or whatever it is. No that's that's not that's not the thought. That's not the thought. But a person having a conviction and believing and saying, "I know that God is a healer. I know that God is a deliverer." Amen. I know that God is is God is God. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to hold to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, it's a man that that is taking God's word as a conviction. No matter what people are saying, he believed that God can heal the sick. He believed that God can raise the dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If I prayed for 10 and it died, he says, "I will be praying tomorrow. I'll be back on the field because I believe that God is a healer." &gt;&gt; So that's that is the place where he's asking us to stand alone is on our conviction. A conviction that is based upon the word of God. But in everything you look really, you will realize that uh you know we need partners. And I think that's the reason why he gave us two hands. Amen. Because one hand will be able to wash this one good, but this one cannot do nothing for this one perfectly. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this one is a partner to this one. &gt;&gt; Amen. So so a lot of things when you look at it, God really, you know, constructed the word and and his plan for mankind was to be able to set up in a place of partnership. &gt;&gt; Amen. For here, this man and this woman, you know, uh uh uh they year and and and and and their work was to express God. Now, look at Adam. That's the reason why he brought Eve later. Look at Adam. His job was to give all the animals their name. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He named the animals and named the fruit trees and give names and give names and give names. That was his job as an amateur god. But when it was time for God to move to the next page in the plan of redemption, the next page because God was anxious to be able to reveal himself and reveal his nature and reveal his ability. It was not in Adam to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not in Adam. Adam could not bring that part of God out. He could not bring that part of a savior out. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was in the woman. It was in Eve. So when he brought Eve on the scene, because she was designed in that way, she was able to get over there and have a conversation with the devil, open her reasoning and and the four came. Now God found an avenue where he will be able to manifest and display the rest of his attributes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So if you look if you look in the deep sense, I mean we can we can uh uh we can take uh we can take uh uh uh uh in any way that we want to take it for our home, you know, uh uh in the way we run our family. And uh uh but if you take it in a deep sense, God was more interested in Eve helping Adam to express the rest of his attributes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was more interested in that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, I believe that he's more interested in uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, me and my wife. Uh, uh, I I think he's more interested in us in us uh, uh, uh, uh, revealing him the best way that we can in this age. Praise the Lord. Then we wash the clothes and who cook the rice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now again, I'm not trying to fight over our home choices. I'm not trying to instruct you how, you know, to run your home and, you know, don't don't do this and don't do that. But what I'm trying to bring you here is that in many in many cases, we we try to reduce God's divine program and rub it in the dirt &gt;&gt; of our choices. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We fuss all the time. Yeah. The Bible say the woman you must be submissive. The Bible say you must be submissive. &gt;&gt; Submissive to what? &gt;&gt; Submissive to the word. &gt;&gt; Because if she cannot be submissive to the word, there is no way she can be submissive to you. &gt;&gt; There is no way she can be submissive to me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The man MUST BE A PROVIDER OF HIS HOME. That's what the word says. Provider. Yeah. The Bible say you must be a provider. So go outside and work. He can go and WORK AND BRING ALL THE MONEY TO YOU. If he does not have that word provide, pro provide means vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He must BE ABLE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP. He can bring all the money. IF HE DOES NOT HAVE THAT, Y WILL SAY that right there. Y will eat the money. You start fighting. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY? THAT'S WHAT we have done. We have taken God's divine program. &gt;&gt; Let let me tell you now. That's the reason why the Bible says God says I am God and there is no one else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why he say he's a jealous God. Because people, this thing is more about God &gt;&gt; than about you and myself. &gt;&gt; HE MADE US TO HELP him &gt;&gt; display himself. &gt;&gt; It's more about him &gt;&gt; than about you and myself. &gt;&gt; IF WE MAKE IT TOO MUCH ABOUT US, you will get hurt in the process. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will get hurt in the process. People have made church TOO MUCH ABOUT THEMSELVES. OH, THEY WANT TO BE FAITHFUL. THEY want to BE DEDICATED. THEY TAKE THE CHURCH. They put the church on THEIR HEAD. THEY WILL NOT FIND JOB. THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING FOR THEMSEL. AT THE END OF THE DAY, they get hurt &gt;&gt; because it's not about you. &gt;&gt; It's not about me. It's about him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's about him. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; And he have called us into this. So he can express himself. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU THINK ABOUT IT, HOW CAN MAN LIKE US WITH FALLEN NATURE AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DRILLED IN OUR SPIRIT, our cruess, HOW CAN WE HANDLE THIS DIVINE CALLING? HOW CAN WE HANDLE THIS DIVINE COMMISSION? MANY MEN HAS TRIED WITH THE EARN WITH THE EARNESTY OF THEIR HEART. MANY WOMEN HAS TRIED ALL THEY CRY, THEY PRAY, THEY TRY TO DO EVERYTHING. But you see, God has been out of the picture. There's been they've been trying to do everything to please this man like me that can never be satisfied. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm I'm I'm very picky. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember how many times Jordan and myself, we have arranged instinct. I push a certain way, he come and push a certain way. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I come and look at it. I say, "So, well, I think you're supposed to be like this. And at the same time I said brother one you are you are a preacher you are not technician leave the brother to do his job. BUT THAT'S JUST HUMAN NATURE. &gt;&gt; That's just human nature. If I IF I JUST TRY TO MAKE IT MY way then what is going to happen? I'm going to hurt HIM BECAUSE HE'S DOING ALL OF HIS BEST TO GET IT RIGHT. AND THEN I COME. No that's not the way I WANT. SO WHAT I'M WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS THAT I'm trying to make him to serve me &gt;&gt; and serve God. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; I know there a lot of time when a preacher preach he's misunderstood. So I'm not worried I will be misunderstood this morning again. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why we have to preach it again and preach it again and preach it again. And somebody said, "Oh yeah, I didn't understand in that time, but this time when you said it, I understood it." So &gt;&gt; you know, so that that is the great thing about redemption. That is the great thing about redemption. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Almighty God could have done everything by himself. He could have named the animals and come and Adam. It's just a free flow. There is nothing for you to do. But God, that's that's not the way God designed his program. &gt;&gt; He designed his program in partnership. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even though he knows what to do, but yet he will give the responsibility to a man and he look at that man &gt;&gt; to be able to carry out. &gt;&gt; He come down and tell William Brandon, it was your choosing. &gt;&gt; It was your choosing &gt;&gt; even though it was a highway, but it was your choice. &gt;&gt; That's what faith is. Faith is making a choice. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm looking for the spir aspiring partner. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for the sparring partner. I have one. I have one good friend of mine. He comes here all the time. The brother there from our coast, brother Valentine. A good sparring partner. You know, I mean, we have fast many night. We have sat down. We have fast. Amen. Praise the Lord. At that time, he was the pastor, you know, there of the local church and and we had a situation that we were we were we were dealing with. I mean, we were first and then we said, "Lord, let's leave it right here. Let's go find something to eat. Let's stop right here. Let's leave it. We come back. We go out." As if to say, "We are not fussing." We go out, we will find food, we eat, we laugh, we talk about different thing, we come back again. And uh so the the the the conversation was so tough. He told me, he says, "Look, my friend, you are my friend. I respect you, but you are not my Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; I mean, when he said that, he took all the air out of my tire. I said, "I surrender." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's my aspiring partner. Even till now. I mean there I think many nights we stay along on the phone we talk and you know when there is situation he calls me and we we talk we good friend very good friend very very good friend very good friend we slap on the floor together I mean we we ate uh uh uh street food together and uh and and that's what it is that's what it is but you see with the with the society that we are living in we we only looking for people that will cheer for us. &gt;&gt; We're really not looking for partners. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We want people that will be on the shoreline cheering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They must not they must not condemn you. They must not con uh you know uh uh they must not say that that you are not doing well then you don't want them on your team anymore. &gt;&gt; But almighty God is not like that. Like brother Brandon says, who is who was Moses for him to give God a better idea? &gt;&gt; Do you KNOW THAT GOD got Job as a sparring partner? Well, he never even came to discuss with Job. He's he's facing his opponent, the enemy, and and they are in a debate and he's telling his enemy, "I have a man on earth. You you you can do anything you want to do to people BUT I HAVE A MAN ON I HAVE A PARTNER on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we see these things like trials. We see it like trouble. We see it like oh yeah the whole world is going against us and everything is falling apart when God have just choose you as a sparring partner. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And watching to see how YOU WILL BEHAVE, HOW YOU going to handle the situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. when God have just choose you to be aparing partner. But you see the spirit of loudia, the spirit of uh of of of prosperity, wealth and and everything must be shining and everything must be good, you know. And then we must just flip the cars and flip the suit and flip the homes and AND AND OH THAT'S THE way to prove that God is with we are prospering and prospering and prospering. &gt;&gt; That's that's our age. So it has put us to the place where we are so nervous. We are so NERVOUS NOBODY IS THERE. WE think people are watching. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are so nervous. We are so consumed with ourself. IT IS JUST US AND us and us and us and us and us and us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, look through the history. Look through the history of revival and see MEN THAT GOD have used and see men that God HAVE USED TO BREAK BARRIERS AND AND BRING REVIVAL. They can never be compared to our our end time preachers because those men had to forsake everything, keep their face on the ground, seek to please God. &gt;&gt; They had TO GIVE UP A WHOLE LOT OF THIS WORD. because they wanted to be a partner with God to do something for God in their generation. &gt;&gt; No, this generation we just party enough. Just bring it. We don't need to bring it. Just bring it. Just bring it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And age world we have become holers. We we haul everything from the internet. Anything that looks good, we h Oh yeah, that's good. That's right. We take it from the movie. That's why we try to run our home. We take it from Facebook, from Ted, from all whatever is out there. We have just become hollowers in our spirit. We have just become holers in our spirit. Put the word before us. We become anxious to leave. But we put that little stream. We can flip and flip and flip and flip and flip and flip. And your spirit is just consuming. &gt;&gt; It's just consuming. is just consuming. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; GOD IS RAISING YOUNG people for his generation. He's always thinking about the next generation. He brings he brings us together uh with our wives and give us a responsibility as stewards to be able to watch over the children. They are not our property. They are God's heritage. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is our responsibility to be able to watch over them and and and and guide them and advise them. &gt;&gt; I never believe that a parent is a Holy Ghost to his children. I don't believe that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you need the Holy Ghost for yourself. &gt;&gt; But we are there. We are there to be guides, you know, to to to to be able to guide them and help them in making choices and and all of that. But we have to know THAT JUST AS HOW GOD HAD A DIVINE PURPOSE FOR YOUR LIFE, he have a divine purpose for the life of those children. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO EXPRESS HIMSELF through them &gt;&gt; at at the given time. &gt;&gt; Because in every age, God needs a partner. &gt;&gt; He's looking FOR THE MAN. HE'S LOOKING FOR THE WOMAN that is going to take him truth to his word &gt;&gt; and so he can prove himself through you &gt;&gt; said try me and see if I will not open the windows of heaven &gt;&gt; proof mean I'm looking for somebody &gt;&gt; ASPIRING PARTNER NOT SOMEBODY that I will give trial to and they will back up oh this Christian life is so hard if I was not a Christian this is how my life was going to be &gt;&gt; praise the Lord Let's go try with something else sickness in our in our lives. It it it it it it decanized us. &gt;&gt; Who told you so? There was one thing when you read the book of Job, there was one thing Job said over and over. I'm not going to let down my integrity. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He could not understand what was what was happening. HE HE NEVER SAW THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM. But he was not allowing allowing what he's going through to rob him of his faith. &gt;&gt; But as soon as we get little trial, then it looks like we don't have faith. Well, I need to be my faith in God because the prophet say I can speak this thing away. I need to know how to speak this thing in out of existence. that everything you speak out of existence, then what kind of world you going to live in? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you speak everything out of existence, what kind of a word are you going to live in? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing what I'm going? &gt;&gt; Are you see where I'm going? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that's the reason why we have uh we have all of the all of the scandal that has come around the Christian church because it's supposed to be the father's business, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the father's business is built on partnership. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now at a place where the bishop just I mean he live so large he get a private plane to fly him all over and the people are living in poverty. We have made a DISGRACE BECAUSE WE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE WE REALLY HAVE NOT GRABBED THE principle of what we believe. &gt;&gt; We're just making a religion out of it somewhere where we CAN WE CAN PLEDGE our allegiance to but we have not got the principle. Oh, that's the reason why that prophet would tell US HE SAYS WARS ARE FOUGHT FOR PRINCIPLES. You say if there is something goes wrong, let's sit down. Let's talk about it. That's why we have a word of God. We are not run by a nation constitution. We are run by the word of God. Let's look into the word of God. IF YOU AND MYSELF HAVE THE SAME INTEREST to make this place better. Then we can judge our differences with the word. &gt;&gt; WE CAN JUDGE IT WITH THE WORD. AND PRETTY SOON I WILL SAY, "OH, I really never see. Now I understand where you coming from." And you can say, "Now I see what you were doing." That's partnership. It's not WHEN I WHEN I'M WHEN I'M JUST CONSUMED that it must be my way or no way. That's not partnership. &gt;&gt; I'm being a detector. IF I'M JUST BRINGING MY THOUGHTS AND BRINGING and and and just bringing my desire TO YOU, I CAN'T show it to you from the word of God. I believe THE REASON WHY YOU MUST BELIEVE THINGS I said is because it's from the word. &gt;&gt; If it is not FROM THE WORD, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO QUESTION IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Ask me they say where is it in the word? &gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT OR OUR PASTOR SAY OR OUR CHURCH SAY YOU CAN TELL SOMEBODY IT'S MY CONVICTION because it's in the word of God. &gt;&gt; I can't show it to you now but I will get the scripture for you later. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother B says we need a spiring partner. the guy that would get in the ring. &gt;&gt; And I mean, in training, he will bl your nose, &gt;&gt; but you know that he don't hate you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, he he's he's doing it to make you better. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I mean, we are so much on eggshells. We are so much on eggshells that as soon as something is said, "Oh, it it hurt that thing you said. said I didn't like it hurt my feelings. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If homes, if uh if uh if if if children and parents were were were were were you know uh working together like sparring partners, I mean a lot of our homes will not be broken. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I mean if you tell the child, I'm the father, I'm paying the bills here and you got to do what I say. Praise the Lord. Then right there he start building his mind. I I have to stop I have to start saving and and get out of this house. &gt;&gt; Because he don't feel like a partner. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He feel like he just be laboring just to be able to build your empire. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Like I said, I'm I'm I'm just using all of these examples &gt;&gt; to be able to grab your attention. I'm not I'm not shooting bullets at you people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; No, I'm not shooting bullets at you people. &gt;&gt; And uh uh there's there there's one thing that is in my mind is for you to realize that your redemption, you are called to partnership. &gt;&gt; If you don't treat it as a partnership, you will live under privilege. You're going to live on a privilege because you're going to be looking for all the prophets that will prophesy in your life &gt;&gt; because you lazy to pray it. &gt;&gt; So you just want the one that can sow seed or prophecy in your life. But if YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR redemption you are called on partnership &gt;&gt; and you remember THAT THERE WAS A MAN THAT TOOK THE ROAD THE old rugged cross &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; when he battle NOT MY WILL BUT LET your will be done. Let this cup pass over me BUT FATHER NOT YOUR WILL LET MY WILL BE DONE. THEN WHEN THE ENEMY IS BRINGING THINGS IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU REMEMBER there was a price that was paid. Praise the Lord. AND HE'S TRYING TO DRAG YOU DOWN IN SIN AND RUIN YOUR LIFE WITH A HABIT. YOU CAN RUN DOWN TO your pastor and say, "Lord, you pay your price. THIS IS MY TIME. GIVE ME GRACE. LET ME STAND for you. Give me grace. LET ME RISE up from this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You will not say, "Well, I've been praying this thing here. I've been praying about it. I've been praying now. I've been praying. I've been praying for many years now. This thing I've been praying for many years now." &gt;&gt; It's because you've been doing it by yourself. &gt;&gt; It's because you've been doing it by yourself. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope the people are understanding me this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope the people are understanding me. See, brother Brown will talk about another partnership here, which of course I think is a evil partnership. And I like the way that he symbolized it. The church of the living God. The church of the living God. But every look in the drawer to bring me bring me a hanky. I think I left it somewhere in the office there. See see what he says now. Here goes that spirit, a blackness, a dark a darkness leaving that man. Now he's uh he's he's looking at an evil spirit. He just prayed for the person. Watch the evil spirit leaving the man. And he says uh uh uh uh uh there goes that spirit, a blackness, a darkness leaving the man. Similarly, you could see it. Watch it. A God, a sympathizing partner. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. As much as we want a sparring partner, we don't want a sympathizing partner. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because you see, a sympathizing partner uh uh uh in in in most cases is is uh uh uh uh it's the one that comes and make you cry the the hardest. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They come and then and and then the the they raise their voice and then uh uh uh you know uh uh uh and then there's there is no tears. &gt;&gt; They are not really connecting with the pains that you have in you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are they are just there for the moment. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they are there for the moment and when they are gone you don't feel their presence &gt;&gt; but aspiring partner &gt;&gt; you feel his presence because when you go home you feel the pain being &gt;&gt; said that guy you really gave it to me today &gt;&gt; you feel the presence of aspiring partner &gt;&gt; but a sympathizing partner you don't feel the presence you just we just well we just we just rub one another on the back and you know yeah yeah it will be fine yeah yeah it will be fine time, my man. Yeah. You know, yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But yeah, he's talking about a sympathotizing partner. And we know how he let how he how he taught us this. How demons will sympathize with one another in a meeting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says you are rebuking the demon here and then there's another one down that will be calling for help. &gt;&gt; Amen. the same spirit trying to sympathize with his friend that so so so they can be so I I I was just looking at this and and it it just caught my mind and uh uh it got a sympathizing partner just a moment uh there it fall just a moment yes there it fall over the man seeing there with a t-shirt blackheaded man his hands is in his face and that spirit just went and hover over him. Praise the Lord. Because sometimes, you know, the people are in a meeting and uh uh uh they are having resentful spirit. You know, a resentful spirit is a sympathizing uh partner to the devil. &gt;&gt; Because when we are rebuking the devil and we are preaching the word of God and preaching something against sin and and you are there that resenting it, uh uh uh you are just sympathizing with the devil. And yeah, we want God to do things in our midst. Yeah, we want God to move in our lives and move in our home and change situation for us. But can we take him as a partner? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Can we take him as a partner? Where will he bring his word and bring the correction of his word? We will say yes Lord I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; LORD MY FLESH IS FALLING. LORD I'M WEAK. Help me Lord to rise out of this. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Ram talks about these these these guys here. Uh share that with you all. So he has to pass this way. Let's remember Mr. Bell of the fruit gi let them remember Mr. Craig of the cheese. How that he couldn't make a a go of his cheese. And one day a voice spoke to him, "Take me for a partner." Now, Brother Brham is talking about people that were in business. People that were in business and and trying to do something and just trying to do it by themsel, trying to do it by themsel and and they want to make gain. They want to make profit and and and uh uh but they're trying to do it by themsel. And pretty soon they are they they are cutting corners and compromising and you know uh uh uh and getting themselves into all sorts of uh scam and all of that. He says and one day this man yet a boy said take me for a partner and many other categit is from. Praise the Lord. You will realize that most of your your your industries that we have today that they were built by men that took God as a partner. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They took God as a partner. In the beginning of their businesses, they put God first. They knew that this partner only asked them for the 10%. So they make sure that they give him it. And he kept he kept his part. And yeah, he's telling us here this man took God as a partner. They took God into their business. Sister, yeah, this is business. This is not this is not Christianity. That business here. When you hear people saying that, which mean they're ready to cheat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that you will put your faith on the on the shelf to do, &gt;&gt; don't do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you will not do it by faith, don't do it &gt;&gt; because there is no way you would do it right &gt;&gt; except you do it by faith except you can apply the word of God &gt;&gt; to what you are doing. &gt;&gt; He said this man they took God as a partner and God bless his cheese business and bless Mr. Coke business. Till now we still brushing our teeth with co toothpaste and all that. There were men that took God as a partner. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me read this. Christ is the ministry of God revealed. And I found a place to close here since I have many many more services to come. Just the beginning of the year. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just the beginning of the year. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's what we talking about people. That's why we want that's why we want to see it. We want to be able to understand it that this whole thing I mean there is no way we can we can we can move this little church until we get into partnership. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a oneman show. It's not a oneman business. I wish you were a preacher. I bring you here to preach as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unless we can realize it's a partnership. That's when I take my family. That's what I can do for the Lord right now. And then let's do it. Let's build a name to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's build a memorial to his name. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. M &gt;&gt; if time I remember many years back I I I I was I was traveling to Guinea one time for the for the for the crusade and uh and I passed in the city I pass in the city where I started preaching as a young young boy back in 1993 1994 I needed to pass there and get to the boat of beginning and then take my transportation the people that invited me was coming this way that message believers. Uh these were people that got in contact with a brother here in the States and he wanted me to help him at the time. So right down I was down to the station as I was waiting I saw I saw one one gentleman and that gentleman he was he was an he was uh yeah he was an immigration officer at the time when the city was controlled by the rebels. Now the city, the the country was back together and I saw him Paul and I went down and I call him I call I said Paul how are you? He stood back he took his glasses from his face. He says he says man where you have been oh I've been in aos he says he says man when you boys left from here this town knew &gt;&gt; that there were some guys that left from here. Amen. &gt;&gt; I still remember I remember the first time we went to preach. We were there preaching to the station. We preach talk about Jesus Christ. We were so excited. Brother Sebastian and myself and and some other brothers James Nim. We were so excited, you know. We preach and talk everything we want to talk. They were listening to us. They were asking us question, you know, and all of that. As soon as we finish, they told us take off your shoes. and said we should take out our shoes. So first I thought it was joke. They said we should take out our shoes. We must take out our shirts. &gt;&gt; We must sat down. We must sit down on the ground because uh uh they they are suspecting that we are on a recurren. How can how can the young men like you people says you are preaching you know they're checking all on our body for marks and everything and uh and they were going to to imprison us unless one of the one of the clergy of the of the city. So good enough we knew the the the Methodist bishop because we were using the Methodist guest house that's where we were living and he gave it to us. So we reference him and they sent somebody to call him and he came over to the station and uh and he says, "Oh yeah, these are my boys. These these are all my songs. Y'all let them go." And then after the guys came to shake our hands, you know, says, "You should come back next week Tuesday. You should come back next week Tuesday." And definitely I went back next week Tuesday, you know. I I was I was I always go there, you know. So he he was telling me, you know, he told me, he says, "Yeah, man. When you guys left, we knew that uh we could feed it, you know, we could feed it because we were not hearing street preachers on the street and all of that." I mean, uh uh I mean, it's it's the time that is given for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a time that is given for us. This is where we find ourself, you know. Uh and do what you can do for the Lord with the time that is given for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do what you can do for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh man, we we have some have some horrible stories to tell you, but not today. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Now listen to this. Now he says, "But but when he put man on partnership with him," Almighty God put man on partnership with him, then let a man act as a free moral agent. See, God, &gt;&gt; he he he he put a man on partnership and he was not using a remote control to to to control the man life. &gt;&gt; He put the man on partnership and yet he put him on free moral agency to make choices. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because how how are we going to ever be better if we don't make mistakes? &gt;&gt; How are we going to improve &gt;&gt; if we don't make mistakes? Amen. So he put us on free moral agencies for us to choose, make choices. And yet when Adam fell, he was the same one that was coming AND SAYING, "ADAM, ADAM, WHERE ARE YOU?" HE WAS THE SAME ONE MAKING ALL THE EFFORT TO be able to redeem this man back. He didn't say, "Oh no, YOU YOU HAVE JUST PULLED MY PLAN." NO. What a man of free moral agency. The same thing that he got he got you on today. See you you at a way you want to you are you are a free moral agent. So therefore if he put the first like that he has to put the second like that. He has to put everyone like that. Oh he acted wrong in the first place. See, but everybody on that same basis now notice him in bringing that back and letting man do that and knowing that he will do it knowing he would do it. But what did he do? He displayed his attribute as a savior. Praise the Lord. Amen. Because that is the only way it was going to happen. That is the only way it was going to happen. So we have to see that it is it is almighty God that get this plan. Amen. It's almighty God that station this place. It's almighty God that has brought us together as his children. He has brought us together as as as partners to be able to lift up the name of Jesus from the corner of this street. Then let's do the best that we can. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's do the best that we can. Praise the Lord. Amen. If I mean if uh if if if if what you can put in it is to is to pray then put it in it. If you if if it's to preach then put it put it in it also. If it's to sing then put it in it. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Inspiring partners. Spiring partners. If we can be able to look at one another like sparring partners and a brother come and tell you that your tie is not straight, you will not tell him only you know how to tie neck tie. That is you you will see that okay this guy want me to look better than you know I'm supposed to look like. &gt;&gt; But I mean we we we have so much of a thin skin. &gt;&gt; Thin skin. Let somebody just say something. We we blow it out of proportion. We don't even see. Okay. Where were they going? &gt;&gt; What were they trying to do? Life will be so easy and better if we would just quickly look at things in a positive way. Okay. Yeah, they were trying to help me. And then they come back and prove that they were really not trying to help you. &gt;&gt; Right? You will realize that you will feel so much good. Even if they come and tell you sorry for for criticizing you that day, it will not it's not going to fix you because you never saw it as crit as the person criticizing you. &gt;&gt; That's the thing that is that is breaking our society. That is the thing that is destroying homes and and and and and and and pulling the church apart is because everybody is just on their individual show. &gt;&gt; Jesus said I must be about the father business and the father business is built on partnership. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God redeemed you, when he allowed you to see the light of the gospel, when he opened your heart to make you to believe his word, he was not just doing it because he wanted to just get another person whose life he will frustrate. He was doing it because he think he can build partnership in you. He was doing it because he thinks that he have found a man. He have found a woman that would trust him. He have found somebody that would take him at his word. And through that person, he might not save a whole nation. But he might use that person to influence their home. He might use that person to shape the life of one young man or one young woman. You might use that person to help uh uh their spouse to become better. We can see it in the light of partnership. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember your aspiring partner will be like your opponent. They might look like your enemy, but they are not your enemy. God placed them there to make you better. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He placed them there to make you better. &gt;&gt; And the more things comes up, the more you take it back to him. Lord, you gave me this power partner and and give me grace. But more than anything, he want to be your spiring partner. &gt;&gt; Amen. He want to be your sparring partner or he call you to be his partner. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You might not believe this but it's truth. God need you &gt;&gt; more than you need him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He needs you more than you need him because he's the one that want to make his his attribute known. He needs you. God could have just folded with Adam and Eve and and and and and destroyed them. We will never hear their name. We have never known them. Created another man in his image. &gt;&gt; But because he needs us more than we need him. He's the one that is constantly coming after us. He's the one that is constantly calling Adam. Adam, where are you? He's the one that is constantly breaking our heart and and appealing to our heart. No, this is not the way for you to do it. You're not supposed to do this. You can do better than this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's because he needs you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The musicians can come. I don't know about you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But when we sang that song, thou my everlasting portion, more than frame of life to me, when we sang that this morning, as the Lord, if there is ever the time that I want to be close, today is now. aspiring partners. That's what redemption is all about. Amen. Praise the Lord. That's what redemption is all about. Paul says, "Let's let's provoke one another to good works, desparing partners. Let's provoke one another. Whatever we are doing, whatever encouragement, whatever correction, let us be towards good work. So we can be better at what we are doing. We can improve our prayer life. We can bring praise. We can bring worship. We can be able to support the work of God. I don't know about you this uh afternoon. Let's just bow our heads together and I pray that this will challenge each and every one of us. I hope something was said from the word of God that would challenge you to take the word as a asparing partner. If you have a loved ones with you that both of you will be sparring partners. We will not be afraid to criticize one another because we know we are doing it. We are doing it to be able to achieve the best. It's all about you, Jesus. We have made our our own personal selfishness to just consume us that we don't see God in the picture of our life. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. It's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made. It's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. Lord, it's all about you, Lord.

I don't know why what you thinking or where your mind is this morning. But you think about it. Think about it this afternoon. Think about it this afternoon. That God designed your path. The almighty God, the one that constructed you, that put your nerves and put all your seniors together. And yet he have choose you. The one that know your weaknesses. He knows your failure. He knows the things you are struggling with. But the talk of his love will never leave your heart. He keeps talking to your heart. He keeps pulling you to yourself. You might be feeling in your flesh and feeling in your mind and get your life into some mess that you regret of. But because God has chosen you as a partner, he's not ready to give up on you. He's not ready to let you go. He know how much you can be of a benefit to his kingdom. He know how much he know what he can do in your life. And he know how much through you he can touch the life of others. I just want every one of us this afternoon if we would just uh recommmit ourself in the hands of the Lord. And Lord, sorry. I've been so selfish. I just been consumed by myself. I've been I just been thinking about myself. I just want to make myself happy. I've kicked you out of the picture, Lord God.
