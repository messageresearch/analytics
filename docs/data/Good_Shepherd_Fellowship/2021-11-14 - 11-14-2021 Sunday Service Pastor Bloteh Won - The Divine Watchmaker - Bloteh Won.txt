[Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so so so [Music] so so [Music] praise the lord god bless you saints and uh it's good to see every one of you and [Music] let's just say a word of prayer our most gracious and eternal father we thank this so much for this morning and we are so grateful that you've gathered us together by your feet once again oh god for we reckon above all things that you have made it possible it is not because we are smart it's not because we know how to take good care of ourselves it's not because we are up to the task but we find ourselves in the hands of the almighty god and we know that all power in heaven and on earth belong to you and we know there is nothing impossible in thy name we know that you are the one and only sovereign authority there is and the one and only sovereign authority that would ever be you alone are god the god of all creations and the god of all flesh the alpha and omega the beginning and the ending the almighty god we are so grateful and we are honored and humbled to know that we are children of the most high god we thank you so much now all through this life you have been with us when we look at father what we went through in the last few weeks the storms that were going through it is enough to say that we were going through the eye of the storm and even in the eye of the storm we were surrounded by your love we were surrounded by a divine protection that we could feel your presence and we knew that we're not on our own we knew that the lord was with us we are so very much grateful father we give you the glory this morning father we give you the honor we praise the father we worship the father we bless thee and we glorified it in the name of jesus our lord and savior once again your children have gathered there are some on their way so coming record them into your hands and we pray that you will come and be with us according to your word of promise which says what two or three are gathered in your name there you are in their midst and that you will break unto us the bread of life and feed our hungry soul this morning before we leave your presence may you come and be with every one of us and grant unto us according to our needs in jesus name father we pray with thanksgiving amen praise be to god yes i had a very short tribute to pay in honor of our brother brother scott yeah but um i couldn't just go ahead without a word of prayer praise be to god i was happy to see every one of you you know um we've heard time and again how much love brother scott had for people around him and we are witnesses of it all we have seen that time and again but there was a portion of it that was left untold and i'm here to tell that story brother scott apart from having so much love for people he had so much love for children he had a special relationship with children i remember when dany and joshua got an accident when the house and i had a knock on the door and when i went it was brother's cut and i saw brother scott you did it the african way because back home that is what we do i will just come to your house without calling you if i don't see you i will sit and wait if i have no time i'll go and i'll come back but fortunately when he came that day we went the house we sat on the dining table and in fact he just poured out his heart he loves these children so very much and we spoke about a lot of different different things and you could see the burden on his heart for the children of god dany at a point in time was working at a subway and at the time i think he was 15 years old would you believe brother scott would take his car and drive to that mall the mall on how did they call it um um noble noble in 1997 there is a small mall day brother scott would drive there not because he was going to buy food not because he was hungry but to go and have fellowship with dany not once not twice he would just go and have time to talk to him and they had fellowship i mean it was just amazing the other day a brother we have not seen in church for a very long time came around and as soon as church was over the brother left and minutes later brother scott followed and when he came out he looked to the left looked to the right and he asked me what is the he mentioned the brother's name and i said he left as soon as service was over and brother brother scott said oh he didn't want us to see him i said brother scott he will come back i don't think this is his last time then brother scott stood and said a couple of days ago i was thinking about his children how they were doing and there were tears there was tears in his eyes how much love he has for children and not only that i remember when this coveted pandemic started brothers curtains just knew me they took sunday's cool materials and they were just driving around in the snow and in the cold going house to house to make sure that the children had something to feed on i mean this was a love story that you cannot emulate a wonderful place in his heart for children and it glades my heart to know that even the children are aware of it and when i talk of the children i'm not talking of the grown-ups like danny and joshua of course they know it but i remember on friday when we were going to the funeral grounds and i said emmanuel and gazwe should stay behind emmanuel walked into the room and he came to me straight he looked into my eyes you know how american children can look at people in the eyes i bought to eyeball and he said daddy we all knew brother's cat if we don't get to be part of this it will really really hurt me very bad i'm quoting him and in fact he cornered me so much that i had no choice but to tell them to get ready and follow us and i just want to say this to the glory of god that he had so much love for the children of god he had so much love for the children and we know that he is in a much better place we know that for sure that he is in a much better place and it's a matter of time that we shall see him again praise be to god god bless you sins [Music] [Music] [Music] my heart [Music] desired and [Music] you are alone and [Music] makes my spirit [Music] you are my friend and you are [Music] i [Music] more than anything [Music] to you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and [Music] you are [Music] does my spirit [Music] to [Music] my [Music] [Music] to [Music] amen amen giving a praise this morning shout glory [Applause] oh yes we love you jesus thank you jesus we bless your name amen amen amen all right um so we have a different order of service this morning so next on our agenda we'll call on brother stephen cassidy to give his tribute brother you have three minutes may god bless you and i'd i'd always worked you could turn that down a little bit i'd always worked on the other side of the desk i had been a buyer at a hospital for many years and um and so my first day in the field and when it was here in minnesota actually it was my first day i was in south dakota for training my first day in the field i met brother scott and and of course i was with my boss he was the owner of the company and you know he was all about sales and and that's what he was trying to do he was trying to make a sale and of course you know brother scott immediately starts testifying and of course he's like yeah you know he goes to you know he's telling about how he goes to church and all this and i'm thinking it's like i didn't know him well but i'm like i don't think you're on the same level and um but yeah i have to back up a little bit i came to the lord in 1978 and but it was not i was not a message believer but i believed in god and when i came to the lord it was not through anybody other than the lord jesus christ himself i mean i i accepted the lord on the tarmac of a air force base in california i'd been at camp roberts california and god dealt with my heart and it was it was i mean it was as real as real can be but it still wasn't in the message and so that was so you know that was that was that was in 78 so now we're talking 92 and i'm uh so i i met brother scott and i loved brother scott and i didn't get a chance to see him very often and you know i'd call on him when i could you know because i had the whole state of minnesota so i was making my rounds and and uh but whenever i could i'd i'd try to see brother scott and we'd i didn't i never sold him a thing but we had the most wonderful fellowship but the the biggest thing with brother scott and you know of course keep in mind i i'd been with the lord since 78 but you know i was not in i was in a it wasn't a denominational church but it was just as good as a denominator you know it's the same as a denominational church it was uh uh they kind of believed in uh actually the root their roots the roots of that church went back to azusa street and uh and they were assemblies of god they can't follow the assemblies of god doctrine and um but it just you know the the the church i was in the people it's like nobody was getting closer to god it's like everybody was getting further away from god it just it was just you know i met brother scott and i saw the life of jesus christ and it was like i mean i i knew there was something he had and i wanted um and so he um anyway so eventually he he you know he just kept saying well just come and see come and see he never once told me about brother branham he just lived the life the life of jesus christ and you know and that's the most important thing we can do is live the life of jesus christ and uh you know and i i i love brother scott someday i'm gonna see him again you know and um but i just you know just i was blessed to know him i was blessed to be his friend he was a true friend for 29 years as true as you can imagine so anyway god bless you all thank you [Applause] let us put our hands together for jesus oh yes we all have great memories of brothers card i remember i mean standing here singing it was because of him i think he was on a christmas eve um [Music] we have a christmas service everybody coming up and sing their song everybody sings so i came up i don't think i sang a song and he said brother get ready for leading song in the church so i just say to god be the glory i receive it i have no musical background just challenge that god if it is to serve the lord i mean you just have to make a way when god told moses to go and free the israelites he said oh i can stop mark and god say just go i am that i am i'll give you i'll show you the way but you know there's a lot of things that we do in the church that um we have those talents and sometimes we don't bring those talents out and that is the reason why we have brothers in the church who always look at you and say no you are you have that talent in you try to bring in our talent of preaching singing and ushering anything that you can lay hands on to to serve god i mean you have just have to come and sit and service is done you wipe the bible and go home but do something for god i mean it's worthwhile so i want to i miss brother scott i mean he was like a dad and i mean somebody who can come and say you can do this i mean just challenge yourself say yes by his grace i can do it in jesus name so let us give a handclap to jesus this morning oh yes just turn to your neighbor and say god bless you amen amen god bless

friend to brother area so [Music] she and her brother and sister and mom choose to come and visit with us so we are grateful for that praise the lord we are grateful for that and we have a another friend and uh that was afraid also to uh brother scott for many years many many years better than ruby k we will hear his name his name will pop up in in uh in conversation once in a while and then uh when brother scott passed i got a text from uh i think brother lloyd or so that brother dan was coming down for the funeral we spoke a little bit on the phone i could tell from his voice that his heart was heavy so we had some few times to visit together so and in the way that we had the funeral set up i thought that okay we are not making much time for for tributes at the funeral so i will have him bring his tribute and his greetings from phoenix as well for us so but then you can come up i actually uh do bring greetings from the evening light fellowship in phoenix and the brother and sister prank who couldn't come up for the funeral and stuff like that and bring their condolences and stuff i met scott and naomi in 1977 one week before they got married i haven't quite wrapped my mind around at all completely to get past it but uh i will say this that in the early days of the church that was up here scott was working in a grocery store and i came up to go to bible college i was in the assemblies of god and i asked brother don fear and i said well what did brother branham say about bible college he said ah he said he didn't speak very highly of it but that was don's way of just kind of spooning me a little along and stuff he never really blasted me over with anything and so i came up and uh i got a number and made a telephone call and it was actually sister naomi and another sister that came down to the the bible college and uh and picked me up and took me up there and then the next week when i went to service uh naomi and scott weren't in service and then i found out the next week that they had gotten married on saturday so that's how far back we go and i remember uh talking to scott i said you know i said i'm working here at the at the hospital i said uh they're needing somebody why don't you come put an application in and uh he came down and put an application in and started i asked the the guy that uh interviewed him his name was john claussen i said well you're gonna hire him he says yeah he says if i hire him he says i don't have to buy another forklift because scott was so big and so that's you know that's how far back we go i would like to scott had a poem he liked and i like poems but i'd like to just recite it for you just because i even think he gave it to me on a on a in a framed one time it goes like this to us battered and scarred the auctioneer thought it scarcely worth his while to waste much time on that old violin but he held it up with a smile he said what am i bid for this old violin and who will start the bidding for me one dollar one dollar now two only two two dollars who make it three three dollars once three dollars twice going and almost gone but from the room far back a gray-haired man came forward and picked up the bow he wiped the dust off the old violin he tightened up all the strings he played a melody pure and sweet as sweet as the angel sings the music ceased in the auctioneer with a voice that was quiet and low he said what am i bid for this old violin as he held it up with a bow one thousand dollars one thousand who make it two two thousand who'll make it three three thousand once three thousand twice going and gone said he the people cheered but some of them cried we don't quite understand what chains it's worth he replied the touch of the master's hand many a man with life out of tomb and life scarred and battered by sin is auctioned cheap to a thoughtless crowd much like that old violin a glass of wine a mess of pottage a game he travels on he's going once he's going twice he's going and almost gone then the master comes and a foolish crowd never can quite understand the worth of a soul in the chains it's rot by the touch of the master's hand that would be my testimony [Applause] praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord we will we will keep uh talking about brother's cat and and on and on until we get to meet him i mean he was he was such a man you know there was nothing but scared i think god built him the way he was he had such a tech skin nothing could get under his skin nothing nothing [Laughter] maybe after you left he got more taker yeah maybe after you left he got more taker but scared after the pastor that pastor this church before me left for some reason he kind of uh fed on his love to jump in the saddle in the sense and bringing him preachers uh and all of that and there were a lot of things i mean one time we sat down and he started to tell me some of the things that people were saying about him and uh and then when he's you know you know brother scan as as tough as he was it was not so uh difficult for him to cry i mean he would yes he would just bustle and start to cry then and we were talking some things uh you know personally and about the ministry and different things and uh yeah but uh he was he was such a wonderful man and we will we will uh sister leah uh my brother joseph army wife got into contraction this morning and so they had russia back to the hospital we thought it was yesterday didn't that happen this morning again she they had to rush back to the hospital and it happened that my wife is in the area there so she she decided that she would she would stop there and help and uh sister kelly have a prayer request here and she's asking that we continue to pray for her sister teresa she's sick with kovac and yesterday she was diagnosed with corvic pneumonia so she acts that we pray and then uh with everything that was happening around us the lord will stay faithful in speaking to us and dealing with us in different ways and and god has a way of preparing his people and he also have a way of comforting his people he prepare us for our trials never tell us what it's going to be never tell us how long we're going to be in it but yet he will prepare us and then when we get when we start going through trials then we think oh i wonder this is what was coming you know and but then and and and while we going through it he has a way to come back and comfort us and uh uh i was talking to to one of the sisters last sunday and uh just at the time uh we heard that brother scott was not feeling too well and we we normally send out text messages uh for for the ones that we pray and and i think she got uh texting with sister naomi and uh uh for some reason she felt inspired to text cisco naomi that uh there are songs that angels will not sing you know you know never never even say anything to cisnow i mean about we praying for brothers cat but just texts are there songs that angels will not sing and then uh uh there was another sister that had had dreaming you know and and was struggling over it a little bit and uh trying to to blow it away but it was always coming to her with the exact color of what brother scat coughing was so until she saw the coughing then she understood why she was having that dream and uh but before we prayed and entered the the service this morning i have a vision written before me brother wesley had this vision november 9th 2021 it was between 6 a.m and 7 00 a.m in the morning and this this is not the first vision that brother wesley have had i think the lord kind of a blessing in that area something down from his father or grandfather that was a minister it was between 6 a.m and 7 a.m in the morning i was up in the air looking down on a memorial guiding it was like i was in a little drone above the garden and cycled around i saw the trees and the rolls of marker and i saw lots of little grain bushes on the ground i thought they were probably in containers i thought they will evergreen in their containers but actually they will they will christmas weather on people's grave i was up in the air i saw a little image of a person kind of a rose out of the ground all at once he was there he had white boxing gloves on and he raised his hands above his head and shouted i won he was a boxer and had just won his battle i was wondering why it was a boxer but after watching the memorial service for brother scared brothers brother scared greeted us as he just finished taking taking his suit off and called our attention to what he was doing saying we might be able to play it back in slow motion he had just taken off his suit and his tie that he was wearing he said barely heard on the microphone now we are ready for battle after having removed his coat suit and tie that is what was needed for wesley to identify the person in the memorial garden as brothers cat but in the vision brothers cat was teen and muscular he had a white boxing glove on and had just won his battle but wesley was thinking about the day when lazarus came out of the grave it was the fourth day november nine was the fourth day of brother scared at the time that brother scat was giving this testimony february 20 2020 he and sister naomi had just stopped to see us on their way back to minnesota about a month and a half previous to that service he had told us the testimony about brother wright and brother life fountain we wish we had the tip recording what he has said praise the lord let's buy our house together normally when the word came by the way of prophecy or any word that was just right to be read before the local church but branham taught us to bow our heads and say the lord's prayer let's say the lord's prayer together our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kid and come that will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from all evil for dying is your kingdom the power and the glory forever amen let's stand on our feet praise the lord praise the lord with my hands lifted up and my mouth full of praise [Music] am i my with praise wave a heart of tents gave me with my hands lifted up can we just lift our hands to the lord yeah wave [Music] breath [Music] i will pass thee your lord yeah i will bless [Music] i will bless [Music] i will bless thee [Music] and wave a heart off i will bless these musicians that will be all for the music thank you let's take our bibles this morning as we trust the lord to help us we want to take it taught i want to read from isaiah chapter 21 isaiah 21. isaiah chapter 21 isaiah chapter 21 let's just read verse 6 for thus said the lord for thus have the lord said unto me sorry go set a watchman let him declare what he see with amen verse 11 the burden of douma he calleth to me out of syria watchman what's of the night watchman watts of the night the watchmen said the morning cometh and also the night if you will inquired inquired return come let's read from ecclesiastes chapter 3 as well let's read verse one to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven praise the lord let us pray father we humbly bought our house to you and and lord we as we approach your sacred word we know that this word is of no private interpretation and that's the reason why we need you right now we need you father for speaking we need you for hearing we need you for receiving if our souls will be fed it will have to come from the master because the soul of man can feel only on one thing that's the word of god so father we ask that lord you will come and break the bread of life to us this morning may we be able to draw strength from your word there's something be said that will draw this closer to you and strengthen us in our journey once again father we remember sister now me lord she's uh a pianist here she's uh on the acoustic guitar she's playing the violin she's uh the one with the children in the children's chapter and father lord now her heart is broken she needs you and so we will ask special grace for her this morning father we pray that you will bless our lord and father we will ask the same for the children pretty soon they will be returning back to their home and and they will have to live with this memory that that is beyond the curtain of time father we just ask grace and strength now for each and every one of us driving to church this morning brother dan told me of another brother that just went on to be with you we also pray for his family father we pray for sister kelly's sister teresa that you are on a take for her lord you are still a healer almighty god we pray father lord god for cecilia that is in so much of pain contraction help your daughter lord father god and bless her and bless the baby too we just want to commit ourselves in your hands now speak to us in a way that only you can in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed this morning uh i first titled my message clock in and clock out i talked to my message clock in and clocked out but then i thought i said well the people that goes to work might think i'm chasing them or i'm trying to peek on them and says all you think about is just clocking and clock out but actually what i was going to talk about is there is one that clocks us into this life and he's the only one that can clock us out our time here we never clock ourselves in so we don't we don't have control on how much time we can be here you don't have control over it there is a man that clocked you in and when it's time for you to be clocked out there's nothing you can do about it i want to talk about the divine watchmaker brother branham talks about uh he talks about the famous watch over and over we will read quotes about brother branham where he talks about the famous watch he will talks about you see the watch and and he talks about you see all everything moving in that famous watch and and and but he said there was a mean spring there was a mainspring that was very important to that famous watch so this morning i want to talk about the divine watch maker praise the lord amen bishop william pilot 1818 he said this about watches he said the watch with eight gears and the spring and all the mechanism could never arise by action of random chance alone he says the the the watch with with all of his gears that makes it to give time and everything that is put together never came together by random change praise the lord there is an intelligence that put that watch together and you realize that uh even as we sit here this morning there are different times time zones i was just asking brother dan i think there is the the allen owl ahead of us there in uh uh phoenix and i think uh north carolina too if i'm right and we have different time zones you know when i was when i was small i was i was of this idea of you know uh uh our parents used to like to listen to the bbc news and and when it come time for news it gave beeps and beeps and beeps there was a setting sound and music and uh and then everybody look at that their watch and then pretty soon you find people start wanting their watches to set a right so in my mind as a child i used to say why the thing that one is right why is it right praise the lord i just i i would just i was i was always i would every day i mean i can remember it will always come to my mind like that and then uh my mommy bought me my first watch and i thought my time was right i didn't care about what was your time my time is right praise the lord nobody going to convince me that your time is right in mind praise the lord until i became smart there was a little there was a little writing on the back of the watch called water resistance wow so i waited until nobody was looking and i put my hand down in the water when i took it off the watch started blinking his eyes i mean i never forget it there that was my first watch i had to take it out and and hide it but pretty soon mama realized i was not wearing it where is your watch [Music] yes yes yeah definitely i had too hoy was water resistant the lord but there are two identical atomic clock one is located in the national institute of standard and technology in colorado and the other one is uh in the royal observatory in greenwich england and these two clocks both of them are the most accurate better than one second in the million years these two clocks they are the most accurate actually uh is proving that the accuracy of your time the accuracy of time of time measurement determine the precision of your navigation the accuracy of time measurement determine the precision of your navigation that's why we have all of these gps you can put from here to colorado put the address and the gps is going to tell you at what time you're going to get there the first time i started using gps2 i i i fussed with it i'm asking myself in my mind i'm saying are you taking consideration of the rail lights and the traffic this time that you are giving me are you considering that that we have real idea i'm not the only one driving on the road but that uh uh a precision and a navigation is determined by time measurement are we together now watch now we're talking about the divine watchmaker i took this i took that talk from something i was listening to and uh some time ago so with that being said you also realize that it's also uh uh recorded and proving that the the clock in colorado it takes five seconds a year faster than the one in witch both of them are proving to be the most accurate time praise the lord but yet it's proving that the one in colorado takes move five seconds a year faster than the one in england so then which one is right both of them are right the reason both of them are right is because the one in colorado is 5400 feet in attitude and the one in england is 80 feet so the more higher you go the lighter you are and it looks like you have more speed that's the reason why the airplane speed faster than the vehicle are we together but both of them are right the only thing that makes it different is just the altitude the one in colorado is more upper than the one in england praise the lord so even with our visitors that might be traveling back today or tomorrow and you have to go by the way of an airplane you realize that your altitude when you are flying the changing altitude is seen in your attitude praise lord the moment the plane starts to take up you start holding for the seed praise lord when you are leaving and growing up the altitude change and it affects your attitude it affects the way you behave if i can fall asleep i enjoy it that way praise the lord trying to get get you somewhere this morning with all of these time things that i'm talking about let's read isaiah chapter 46 verse 10. this is uh will be a familiar verse to you the scripture says here let's read from verse 8 isaiah 46 from verse 8 remember this and show yourself and show yourself man bring it again to mine oh ye transgressor remember the formal things of all for i am god and there is none s i am god and there is no like me declaring the end from the beginning praise the lord and from ancient times and things that are not yet done say my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasures i am the law that is known as declaring the end from the beginning so in the word of the lord it shows us that god is outside of our time space he's not controlled by your seconds and your meanings he's not controlled by uh uh uh you know your your winter and summer he's completely out of time space praise the lord because we have to realize that he's their internal one he created time praise the lord but he's not controlled by time he knows the end from the beginning praise the lord it's almost like if you have if you went down to see a parade and you are standing on the on the on the side of the street and the martian groups are coming you see them as they come you only see this one you look back okay those ones down there they are wearing gold uniform you see that you can't see the next one until they come around the corner you want to see the ones that come and pass before you praise the lord that is the way in our time what you know right now is that i'm standing here preaching to you praise the lord that's what you know every other thing that your mind is is is reaching out for you don't know that you're just guessing i hope when i get home my food is there i hope i hope you you just i mean you but what you know right now is what is before you but there is a neighbor in the place of the parade that leaves up on the seventh floor and when that neighbor gets on her balcony she can see the beginning of the parade amen and she can see the end she can look here and look here and look here and look all over praise the lord are we together for us life is a sequence of past present and future that's what we call life that's what we know as life we talk about our past we talk about what we what we know is presently happening and we we we guess we probe and hope that what is happening now will bring us a better future for us it's a sequence of past present and future praise the lord but the one that has the advantage point to them life is simultaneous he can look here he can look there he can see everything he can see these other ones they put their drums down and they are sitting down waiting for the the you know for the group to go and then they can jump back up he sees you that are standing by that corner you are just enjoying the group that is coming right as they turn the corner god is out of our time space and that is the reason why he can drop down into time and fulfill his word nothing picks him by surprise nothing take god by surprise that is the reason why it's better for you to be on god's time than to try to put him on your time praise the lord amen i wrote this down it was said one time by albert einstein he said people like us who believe in physic says no base he says know that the distinction between past present and future is a stubborn persistent illusion praise lord in another way is because because uh uh uh uh we we are in this place where the uh uh uh our our life here is is is governed by this sequence of past present and future is in a place where sometimes we we we become stubborn to think there because this thing happened to me in the past so is going to produce this as a result we we we become stubborn to to uh uh put seven things in our mind not realizing that there is a god they have all the our steps they have numbers our days he even numbered the head on our head praise the lord that's right amen and he gave boundaries to all things he lay our boundaries that we cannot cross that's right praise the lord but our human instinct constantly tell us and that's the reason why sometimes we lost trust in people oh he did that to me oh somebody did that same thing to me and and this god is behaving the same way i can trust him why is is because we are in that sequence of past present and future and it's something that sometimes we become stubborn until the grace of god brings a birth and brings us to the place where we can say like like our poor i live by faith and not by sight praise the lord when you look at the watch and you look at you know well now we all go into digital watching and all of that praise the lord and uh you realize uh you know uh such a blessing now we have a wash that can you know it can tell you how many steps you know you all can and all of that but think about it this way let me drop back to something that i was thinking about last night think about it this way the watch even before the digital watch the the switch watch and uh and then the most expensive one and and as you can call it i call into uh uh according to the scientists they said that the watch is a simple loop system praise the lord it's a simple loop you look at it you see everything moving in there you see the second hands moving and you see everything they call it a simple loop system because it all goes down to the mean spring when the mainspring gets out of other you just have a decoration on your hands praise the lord you just have a decoration and yet we paid money which of course i'm not i'm not coming against you wearing watch don't don't think about that i'm talking about the divine watchmaker i'm talking about almighty god praise the lord amen oh i've watched i've wore watch that is not working praise the lord i just feel like it would make me look nice if anybody asks me for my time i look on my phone and tell you my time praise the lord does that relax you it relax you i can preach now okay okay okay it's a simple loop system yeah the wrist that the watch sits on is called a complex closed system we fuss about the money we pay for the watch and then and and and and and that the brand name of the watch and and all of that but yet it cannot be compared to the wrists that you put the wash on it's called a a complex close loop system the race adopts to the change of weather praise the lord you are wearing coats and methinks is because down here is cold when you get to arizona you might not need that jacket better dan so the race adopts to the change of weather it fights its own invaders if you should get some kind of illness that goes through your race your immune system saints sent out force to fight against that sickness praise the lord and it also is a self-repairing system because when you get a cut on your hands it can heal praise the lord when that means spring like i said leaves the watch it's just a decoration on your hands it can never repair itself praise the lord do you see what i'm going to with this divine watchmaker praise the lord so we realized that there is a bigger picture beyond what our eyes can see and what we think our mind understand there's a far bigger picture praise the lord so as we talk about this divine watchmaker we realize that just like how the natural watch had a designer they put their name there there is also one that designed our time where are we going to be at a particular time in life there is an intelligence that have designed that and as time beats it influences our life brother branham said in the message choosing of a bride he says the decision you make this morning will determine where you will be five years from now praise the lord amen so we realize that we are not here by chance if this watch had an intelligence that puts it together that it can put a mechanism in it to be able to count my steps praise the lord there is one that had an intelligence that order our steps he don't count it he order it he order how many steps we will take from the day we talk our first steps he order the places we will pass the people we will meet amen praise the lord all we know is just in this little box of live sequence of past present and future that's the reason why we can trust the almighty god we can trust the great infinite one that know the end from the beginning praise the lord that's the reason why god can can commit a promise he can give prophecy and yet he can make sure he watch over his word because he knows exactly what is going to happen you think about this jesus in his ministry and to see how the the sanhedrin's council were so i mean they were so dogmatic that jesus would come according to isaiah prophecy he will walk right into the temple they don't have no record of him and when he walked there he take the book open to where it is written the spirit of the lord god is upon me praise the lord and as he's reading it every word is quiet everybody is sitting down looking at him the bible says he reads he closed the book he handed it back to the priest nobody asks him a question amen he sat down the service was over he went home and he says what kind of a man was that where did he came from praise the lord the same almighty god that means there was a second part to that scripture that was supposed to be fulfilled when mary bannon was preaching birth pains god took control of the sin amen order his wife to buy him a new brain bible and he will have the pages stuck together he will try to find it why because god has already determined that that time at that time there is not a meaning or a second with past this is the time when my world will be fulfilled [Music] god will set the scene and allowed a priest to hand him a bible and he will open the bible and read his text he would take the bible give it back to the priests he will preach his scripture or his semen and as his living the holy spirit will remind him what has just happened it's written praise the lord he said you you yeah the echo in his ear this day this scripture is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled praise the lord don't take too much praise that you brought yourself here to this church this morning there is one that order your steps here and there is nothing you could have done about it you might have not had it on your calendar you might have not dreamed about it a few months ago you might have not played it but on his divine calendar it was destined that we will be here this morning praise the lord so please don't hurry me whatever time that he have destined for us to spend together less many together [Applause] amen praise the lord praise the lord amen you see and these things happen and pretty soon we become conscious of how how much finite we are praise the lord how much if god don't help us we will make wrong choices we will deny ourselves from blessings pretty soon we realize that but you see there is a stubborn persistent thing that want to keep us in this box of past pressing and future praise the lord amen oh what almighty god we self what almighty god we serve in message divine love he says this talking about the famous watch the little mean spring in the middle of the watch time the middle the little mainspring in the middle of the watch times that watch to everything it times that watch to everything and when god loves and when god is love and love moves into your heart it times every emotion and every right with god's bible you don't want to show the people what a fine crystal you got what a fine face it got talking about your watch now it's not working though what a fine hand you got a fine ruby a god but what a wonderful time peace it is the word is sick and tired of looking at great big spears and looking at fine dress people and looking at a bunch of acing they want to see the genuine love of gods in the heart of his people that's what the word is looking for the word is dying for love the church is dying for love and jesus said ye are the salt of the earth praise the lord but when the sword lost his heaven it is hands forward good for nothing but to be thrown on the feet of man praise the lord and if the church has lost it divine revelation of the love of god that was the thought that caught my heart in that paragraph i just read to you there is a divine revelation of the love of god many people think the love of god is charity you know it's just it's it's it's being nice and they just think the love of god uh uh you know that the first thing you know i mean and i mean that's what astonished the the the the pharisees when they saw jesus whipping the people out of the temple i mean they could not associate that with all the miracles that he was doing and all the kind words that he was speaking but they didn't know that in god law there is correction there is a divine revelation of the love of god that have been displayed to us in this age that we are living in amen praise the lord amen we're in his law we realize that love there is a sacrificial love praise the lord we realize that there is corrective love we realize there is redeeming love praise the lord can you imagine that god god telling abraham to prove his love by sacrificing his son praise the lord so if you look at the picture there god really did not wanted isaac the man that god wanted was abraham praise the lord but what almighty god was going to do was to see how much this son that abraham waited for over 25 years to see it he can for one detach himself praise the lord amen amen brother called me one time and and he was telling me but juan please pray for my voice and uh and and we talked and i and pretty much i could see it you know i could see it being a friend a preacher the first thing that comes to our mind is that oh you know my my family name amen i don't want my children to ruin my ministry now sometimes the law sees all your fears praise the lord and he's just ready to deliver you from your fears praise the lord and it's going to be in a way where this young child starts to be a child he's going through the change of life oh and i'm so afraid how can me being a minister and my children behave that way so you see it's no longer about god it starts to become about you as a person you want to protect the family name you want to protect the church name and god says that you are building a name for yourself when you're supposed to be a bearer of his name you're supposed to be a bearer of his name you're supposed to be a woman that represents his name amen praise the lord so now he's going to allow abraham to come to that place god right from the foundation of the word the bible says jesus was the lamb of god slain from the foundation of the word so we know right from the foundation of the word god had that thought in his mind so he's not going to change it because of abraham to now sacrifice abraham's son but god was going to prove if he had found favor with us and we love him if we can give him the things that means so dear to us praise the lord you know how long abraham waited for this boy praise the lord he had ishmael but this was the one that god spoke to him about and he waited for it i told the brother i said brother i can see your fear i can see your fear but let me tell you the person that needs the lord the most you are the one you need the lord the most your body is going to be okay praise the lord if you take your place as a servant of god and love god you know the enemy will do those things to distract you i said i i said tell me i mean tell me tell me that you are not distracted you don't even have inspiration to preach everything now that is on your mind is my family need my repetition my ministry praise the lord i just i told him i said just stop just start loving the lord you will see those boys coming right into life and we we just had a good time he's a good friend of mine we just had we just had a blast he says he said brother one it looks like that is just what i needed to hear as hard as it sounds i believe it's nothing but the truth because i can tell you i'm scared to death you know i'm scared to death look you can protect the things that god gave us praise the lord amen if god gives a gift he protects it so there is a divine revelation of the love of god the means brings jehovah jarrah in the middle of the watch that makes every movement clicks to perfect time the main spring there is a mainspring that holds this word there is a mainspring that holds this church and it better be this word it better be this word i i'm not the mean spring no i'm not the main spring praise the lord you better cleave to this word and when the holy spirit comes in there's something that moves you can understand what it is is is it it's a supernatural being inside moving controlling your emotions making you to strain amen when actually you feel like running but you will shout when you don't know what you are doing you will praise god just automatically why because there is a mean spring that is creating some joy it is creating some emotion in you that you don't have control over praise the lord amen you might not know a word your next meal comes from uh where you would get money to pay your bill but there is something inside praise the lord that make you satisfied the divine wash maker put it there just like our brother talks about the touch of the master hank that changed the wolf of the violin when that old man took the violin and tightened the strain and tune it up it changed the wolf praise the lord amen and i believe that's what some of us need we just we just need to be wind up a little bit amen we just need to be wind up to be brought back to the world that's why malachi 4 came to bring us back to the faith of the fathers it was a prophet ministry that would wind our life back to bible days not just to church membership but back to bible days when the holy spirit comes and something moves in you you don't understand it he says it controls your emotion it makes you stream when you actually feel like running and you were shout when you don't know what you are doing you will praise god just automatically amen i see some of the young people the song is singing their hands is just so heavy to clap they just need to be torn a little bit amen glory be to god pretty soon you will see those hands that were so hard to clap glory in here what are you saying to yourself i will never do that wait you just wait i'm praying for an outpouring here you just wait i've seen where young people cried and they rolled on the floor and they were so slain i remember one time i was i was there in ederweight preaching that's back 2004 and and and i was preaching in uh and and uh uh at the end of the series can you remember what i was preaching and i and and uh and and we just had an auto call and i saw this young lady you know came from the scene never i never talked anything about it she just came from us he came to the altar and i mean she was just pouring her heart crying crying and after i pray for everybody and she was just there crying and crying and uh i was wondering i said laura whatever is her need granted to her so after the service i went behind the building and i started looking for her and i saw her in an axle i you know i actually just i you know try to make friends with her and and we are still friends still today and uh uh i i said why were you crying you know and she bought her head and she said i don't know what took me from my seat i've never gone to the altar before it was just like something lift me off from my seat praise the lord and i'm telling you if something lifts you up from your seat it's a birth praise the lord amen it has to be the divine wash maker that knows the time he knows the meaning he's going to start dealing with you amen it's the main spring the spring of god's grace in the middle of your heart controlling you making you to sh to shone evil and accept life praise the lord and if there's something you're struggling with in your life for the verified for you to identify that you are struggling with this thing that's the grace of god to you praise the lord whenever you identify something in your life where you say i need god in this area let me tell you what is happening is because god has already got engaged and he wants to make you a partner that's right he want to make you a partner so what is happening is that he's creating conviction so you can identify i need to deal with this why because he want to make you an overcomer you cannot claim to be an overcomer if one morning you get everything just gone no he want to as associate you in your battle and after you identify these things and you can fight along praise the lord so it's always the grace of god whether it comes from the preacher all the holy ghost help you to recognize it is god engaging you praise the lord amen why little baptism he says who is behind all this what is what is the intelligence that is behind all of this what is the intelligence that is behind the leaves falling off the trees praise the lord that the leaves will keep time they don't wear wrist watch they don't wear wrist wash like we do but they know the time to drop their leaves praise the lord i can see that tree talking to the one across there all mine is gone praise the lord amen and if you have trees uh like myself you see these leaves i rigged them yesterday over they are just keeping time they are just keeping time that time came they have to do their work they are obeying the divine watchmaker there is an intelligence that guides him to death praise the lord the same intelligence that wakes us up in the morning and gave us consciousness praise the lord amen amen amen can you imagine nebuchadnezzar growing seven years as obese and not even knowing that he's a king praise the lord that consciousness was gone his nails grew out and eating food from the ground this is a king oh that's the reason why when we wake up in the morning and we can have consciousness that i'm alive there is nothing better than raising your hands say thank you jesus thank you lord thank you jesus who is behind this what is the mean spring that turned this great economy of god praise the lord that's the reason why we believe that coronavirus is not a surprise to god amen the prophet of god told us we will have jam jam warfare praise the lord sicknesses will break out that the doctors will not find the kill it's just beginning jesus said it will all be called the beginning of sorrow praise the lord there is a mean spring that turned this great incontinent of god we find it's the holy ghost it's not left into the hand of a man to do things no it's in the hands of god let the politicians do whatever they want let the scientists do whatever they want like we always say yeah prophecy is stronger than politics praise the lord amen he's the divine watchmaker and there we read in isaiah where god had these men that were gifted to be able to watch the time and he would reveal things to them concerning the time that the people are living in the how he dared with the prophets all true the ages they were actually the time peace of god when you read in the book of samia the bible said after a long time that the people never had a prophet whenever samya comes to time the people always knew he came with the word of the lord they come together they wanted to hear what what is the prophet going to say what's going to happen to our crops this year how our animals what's going to happen to the animals are we going to break into war because they knew that the prophets were connected to all the divine watchmaker praise the lord and until the prophet delivered his message the people become so nervous and when the prophet gave his message the people get at ease because they knew that god has spoken and whatever god said it has to come to pass praise the lord living in an ancient dead in time where people are constantly becoming disconnected from the divine watchmaker praise the lord people are becoming so disconnected and they will do everything to argue with truth they will do everything because we can make our research on google praise the lord amen it's spelled g-o-o so it has it's become a god to some people they try to find truth and comfort praise the lord this guy called elmo spencer he said this about avoiding truth he said there is a principle which is bound against all information people that just you know they just try to block themselves which is approved against all argument and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance there is a principle and this principle it's a principle that is we do it we all do it unconsciously that's right it's a principle that that that makes a man to condemn before he investigate that's right amen solomon said in proverbs 18 verse 13 he says it is foolishness to answer a matter before you yield amen he says it's fully for you to answer a martyr before you hear it and then sometimes we do it unconsciously praise the lord you look at a group of people whether it's a church or take for example you see you see some nice sisters dress you know they dress in decent the first thing that comes to your mind is that they are message believers praise the lord amen is it a wrong thing no it's not a wrong thing because it shows that you have a desire in you for people to dress decent and you wish that every man or woman dress decent praise the lord and in prayer so maybe you approach them and ask them which church do you go to and you find that that world goes to some believing christian church and then obviously when when it does not fall in the ranks of the message then i mean sometimes we we try to cast them off that's not a good attitude amen no it's not a good attitude praise the lord i remember one time in the in the shopping place i ran the eye and and i saw the lady just exactly what i said to you i fed the same i thought she was a message believer but i didn't ask for which church she went to i came back and i greeted her and i told her i just want to tell you something i appreciate seeing decent ladies that's all i had to say to her praise the lord and god bless you what it did to her only god in heaven knows amen praise the lord amen but you see that is the way that people evolved through the pharisees did it all the time amen nicodemus came to jesus and he says we know he was a chief priest he was a chief among the sahendra counsel he said we know that no man can do this except they come from god praise the lord so they were seeing truth they were seeing truth but you see because they have condemned it instead of jesus's session scripture search the scripture investigate this thing search the scripture in them you will have life praise the lord when a wise man came running down there to jersey where is he born of the king of the jews herald sent from men from the sahendra council they were the one that came to his house they flipped the straw and find in the prophecy of my kind what is that one will be born in bethlehem praise the lord but because john the baptist never came through the assistant he came as a man from the wilderness they condemn him before investigating you see when you put yourself to that place it does not give you room for you to search the scripture it does not give you room for you to look in the message praise the lord it does not give you wrong for you to even be able to help somebody praise the lord if you just see a young woman and you just condemn her she's a prostitute it does not give you wrong for you to share the christ that you have with her it does not get you wrong jesus knew the woman underwear was a woman that was not living right he knew that and that was the reason why he went by that way all he had to do was to investigate a little bit he tried to investigate praise the lord amen what if you want this water go call your husband he was investigating praise the lord and then she said i have no husband that's that's right you just said the truth because you have five and even the one you're living with is naive in your husband why because he made room to investigate her praise the lord while the disciples were watching behind the corner condemning her why is he talking to that woman yes sir that's how people evolve truth praise the lord you see since that's the reason why you cannot replace anything with the holy ghost amen you cannot replace a church membership you cannot replace some sensation with the holy ghost if you have the holy ghost then you have no reason to be afraid because jesus promised it will lead you to all truth that's what he said it will lead you to all truth so don't condem just follow investigate investigate and pretty soon things will start opening oh wow wow then pretty soon you start appreciating because there is a time in the season for all things praise the lord for all things when the internal god broke out of eternity into time there is an unwritten law that was established that everything that was created will be governed by time have you ever heard the slogan that says time will tell amen because time came out of eternity so god place truth in time time don't tell lies time don't tell lies amen you can change your age make yourself young at time will come your body will start telling you you start arguing with yourself because time does not lie it came out of eternity and eternity is the source of truth a man can claim whatever he wants to claim give him time brother branham said give him a long road he will hang himself praise the lord there is an unwritten law when the internal god broke out of internet and condemns himself in the border called the logos there was an unwritten lord to everything that is created under the heavens there is time praise the lord there is time to wait if we can just trust and all of that the divine watchmaker that put time to everything he has everything under control praise the lord he has everything under control and if we will trust him and don't guide our life by this past present and what we hope the future will bring sequence that we live in like i said it stop them it will keep hunting you it will keep haunting you every time you have to make a choice it will come back wash up praise the lord am i saying that you should not learn from your past no that's not what i'm saying that's not what i'm saying should not observe or hope good for the future that's not what i'm saying if that's what you are hearing i'm telling you now that's not what i'm saying but i'm saying there is a god that knows the end from the beginning amen and he has written a narrating lord and giving time to everything under the heavens everything will tell the sun to come up in the morning who tell the song when to goes down a word is watch a listening to the divine time maker praise the lord now you see nature has not had a lot of problems like we have it's because they have been so connected to the divine time maker amen they have been so connected to the divine time maker they just wrote arms praise the lord amen so as we continue to mourn and think about brothers cat let's remember that we all have a time our life will come to an end we all have a time in one of these days there will be a tribute that will be said about me and there will be tributes that will be said about you there's a divine clock that is clicking and every time your heart beat is is a click one step to death last sunday we share with you brother branham said it said it's a doorway you can turn your back to it when you turn it turns every step that we take we're getting closer to that doorway praise the lord but the one that clocks us in is the only one that can clock us out praise the lord in the message expression brother branham said this i knew i had this year then i was just going to forget about it but let me just share with you and then i found a place to close thank you for bearing with me he said many times it has been said that a person died prematurely or something that may uh or something that may be some saying the date that there's something wrong that isn't the case to a christian amen solomon said why be foolish and die before your time a man can make evil choices and do different things but one that is born in christ his life has been torn by the divine watchmaker yes amen and every step is clicking towards eternity amen praise the lord amen even the things were we we will make mistakes god will use those very same things to teach us and be characters in our life amen praise the lord he is the divine watchmaker he has time for everything everything young people there is no reason to do a rat race there is no reason to be wanting to be like someone else just get in connection with the divine watchmaker praise the lord musicians you can come [Music] we will miss our brother [Music] but we are comforted because he came up with a boxing glove and said i'm i've won one brother wesley shared that with me right after the funeral right when we came from the graveside because he uh it took it took the graveside to kind of confirmed the whole thing to him because just like how the graves were lining up so now we came back from the gravesite and he pulled me in the siding and told me we prayed [Music] then i called him later and said write it down i believe that is god way of comforting us [Music] that he's in the best of his body he came out of the grave as a man that have won his battle [Music] it is our time to fight amen let's uh don't allow anything to discourage you things might be happening you you don't have you can put your brain around it you can put your mind around it but just give it to the divine watchmaker [Music] and see how the lord will order your steps and see how he will be with you praise the lord i pray that the lord will just comfort each and every one of us [Music] the scripture says we must learn to normal our days praise the lord but i learned to look at that scripture as we must learn to know the one that have normal our days praise the lord [Music] let's buy our hands now [Music] i know the master of and he can count the star and make the sun to shine again i know the master of [Music] hallelujah jesus i know the master of the wings i know the maker of the race make the song to shine again i know now also realizing that the enemy knows that our human mind is caught up in this place of our past and our presence and what we hope the future will be he knows how to use our past and use our failures and and and han us and make us so terrified that we don't even want to try we don't want to even make effort but you see scenes like brother branham said he said it's it's not mean that it's keeping this all-time religion he said it's my religion that is keeping me we have to realize that the god that have caught us he's more than able there is no need of crossing breaches before we get there there is no need of problem into the future and just being afraid we have to trust him we have to trust him simply rest our faith in the law with this time that we have especially the time that we are living in we have to go to work we have to go to businesses we have loved ones friends relations and people are sick all over the place [Music] we just have to trust god do all we know that is right to do and we just trust the lord knowing that until our work on earth is gone [Music] sickness cannot clock us out sickness never clock us in he's the one that cluck us in and he's the only one that can clock us out brother brandon said if my time comes i don't want to leave one meaning after that we know in the scripture how hezekiah wanted to do over time we know the things that did happen let's live for christ let's give him our best let's live for christ let's trust him let's believe him if he have other hours to till this far and since we are more closer to home than where he brought us from it would take us a long way to go back and start learning how to lie and start learning how to lust and start learning how to smoke and start learning it would take us a whole lot because every time you try to learn it you're just only going to end up with regrets and your heart is going to be broken because what the work that god has done in your heart there is no power of hell we have to trust god we have to believe in the holy ghost we have to believe in a keeping power that god has given us [Music] all the way things are going we you we have to be careful oh yeah let's be prayerful let's be prayerful let's trust the
