[0:00] [Music]
[0:12] for this privilege of
[0:13] assembling together one more time
[0:16] knowing that someday we will assemble
[0:19] for our last time as
[0:21] mortals and then we'll assemble in a
[0:23] glorified
[0:25] state with thee and all the redeemed of
[0:29] all ages shall be assembled there all
[0:31] our hearts beat
[0:32] hive and of great anticipation waiting
[0:35] for that hour to arrive
[0:38] with that all fears vanish from us
[0:41] we have nothing to fear nothing to dread
[0:44] we look forward
[0:45] to the promise that the eternal god has
[0:48] made us
[0:49] and we know that it's true that is why
[0:53] we live we live for that
[0:55] that hour that time when this
[0:58] mortal will be changed and we'll be made
[1:01] like him
[1:02] and there will be no more sickness no
[1:04] more sorrow
[1:05] no more heartaches oh it'll all be over
[1:08] then
[1:10] and with joy of heart we in faith and
[1:13] courage we look forward for that day
[1:17] that's why we are gathered here today
[1:18] lord to confess our wrongs and ask for
[1:21] mercy
[1:22] that's why we face this altar this
[1:24] morning because that we know we're
[1:27] immortal and
[1:28] there's many mistakes in us and we're
[1:30] full of fault
[1:31] but we come to confess our wrongs and
[1:35] then look to our heavenly father with
[1:37] open hearts
[1:38] for the blessings and renewal of
[1:40] strength and faith
[1:41] that he would give us in this hour as we
[1:44] have assembled here according to the
[1:46] promise
[1:47] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:51] or we claim that we have passed from
[1:53] death unto life
[1:55] by his promise and we are caught up in a
[1:58] heavenly atmosphere
[1:59] setting with him now may he teach us
[2:02] this morning the things that he'd have
[2:04] us to know
[2:05] and give us the bread of life that we
[2:08] might be sustained for the
[2:09] future that lays before us grant it lord
[2:13] this is our prayer that we asked in
[2:15] jesus christ's name
[2:20] amen
[2:22] good morning to everyone and it's very
[2:26] good to be assembled here with you again
[2:28] this morning in this
[2:30] heavenly atmosphere of worship
[2:33] just a teeny bit late you had a some
[2:36] real
[2:37] real bad call just a few minutes ago
[2:40] boy laying there dying and it's as sure
[2:43] as i'm standing here the lord touched
[2:45] his body
[2:46] [Music]
[2:48] hallelujah a boy
[2:51] standing here which is my cousin's son
[2:54] they were really catholic to begin with
[2:56] but they went to mass this morning and
[2:58] something told him to come here and so
[3:01] they
[3:02] there's a change so they're they're
[3:04] coming out the house and
[3:06] prepare for water baptism so then um
[3:09] there's a
[3:10] uh there's a just wonderful things that
[3:14] our lord does all time he's just
[3:15] constantly doing things
[3:16] they come to get in and uh they couldn't
[3:19] get in they said there's just no way to
[3:20] get in i said well you
[3:22] want to talk to me and i said just come
[3:23] on up the house and we'll talk that over
[3:25] there
[3:26] so i thought on my road to new york now
[3:29] to this meeting coming up that it would
[3:31] just be so nice
[3:32] i know i'd be refreshed to drop in and
[3:36] help light my fire from what far you all
[3:38] have and
[3:39] we stopped for a day this morning
[3:42] and we got in yesterday day before
[3:45] yesterday
[3:47] at noon and then uh we got to leave i
[3:50] was going to leave this
[3:52] afternoon but i think i'll go and we
[3:54] start in the morning early real early
[3:56] we might have some snow on the roads and
[3:58] things between here in new york i'd go
[4:00] through
[4:00] virginia through the mountains and all
[4:02] through the alleghenies
[4:04] just in the bottom part then of the uh
[4:07] of the adirondack
[4:08] so we began it i forget it's the arena
[4:12] there i knew when they told the old
[4:13] saint nicholas serena down i understand
[4:15] they built this new one
[4:16] and as far as i know we're getting about
[4:18] some of the first nights that's ever
[4:20] it's been let out so we're
[4:21] grateful for that for the greater new
[4:23] york uh
[4:24] pentecostal people and i think we've got
[4:27] several churches
[4:28] cooperating and we're expecting a great
[4:31] time
[4:32] and we'll be back the lord willing uh
[4:35] uh sometime next week and and if it be
[4:38] the will of god
[4:40] well we hope to get the stop over for
[4:42] sunday a week for
[4:44] for the sunday morning service and then
[4:47] uh uh boards right in owner pastor again
[4:51] is always doing the scene
[4:53] and uh and i thought maybe if i got into
[4:55] the evening out asking and then
[4:58] being there's a nice group here and
[5:01] people i see from out of town are here
[5:03] i thought maybe tonight if the pastor
[5:06] hasn't got anything special
[5:08] that it would be uh we'd have a little
[5:10] service tonight just a short one
[5:12] maybe pray for the sick hallelujah thank
[5:15] you
[5:16] we are hoping to pray for the sick
[5:19] tonight talk on divine healing and and
[5:21] pray for the sake
[5:22] start early so we can get out early and
[5:25] if the pastor will
[5:26] uh what you usually start at 7 30 is
[5:28] that right how about starting seven
[5:30] tonight
[5:30] seven let me get on at 7 30 did i let me
[5:33] out by 8 or 8 30 to give people time
[5:34] then to
[5:35] to go if that's all right
[5:38] everybody laughs i said 8 or 8 30. i'm
[5:42] i i hope to be out at that time
[5:45] praying for the sick you know we never
[5:47] know so we
[5:49] have had a great time since leaving you
[5:52] in this last
[5:53] fall early and uh the lord has blessed
[5:56] us in many
[5:57] great things and and tonight if the lord
[6:00] willing
[6:00] i want to tell you on the last
[6:02] visitation i had from god in colorado
[6:05] a few weeks ago and that's what i
[6:07] thought i'd bring in now
[6:09] maybe stimulate faith for a good healing
[6:11] service tonight for the sick and the
[6:12] afflicted
[6:14] now this morning to get right into the
[6:16] service
[6:17] uh something struck my heart about
[6:21] a month ago and uh
[6:24] it might be now i think they're or
[6:26] they're taping this
[6:28] tape and they'll say all right so don't
[6:30] know what the tape gets out to others
[6:32] i can't say that while i'm going to
[6:35] speak on this morning
[6:37] uh i can't say that it it is i know it's
[6:40] right
[6:41] see the message part will be right but
[6:44] the thing that i want to do is a
[6:45] question
[6:46] in my mind it looks so real
[6:49] and yet since i come in and since i
[6:52] it was revealed to me i have been
[6:56] so scared that i'd say the wrong thing
[6:59] and might leave the wrong impression
[7:02] upon people
[7:03] and it's a and i what i had notes wrote
[7:06] down on what i was going to say i cut
[7:08] part of it out
[7:09] so that i might not make it too strong
[7:12] because you see if a person
[7:15] i i love the lord god and the only way i
[7:18] know i love him is because i love you
[7:21] that's the only way i know and yet i
[7:24] don't want to have anything
[7:25] that's revealed to me and then i'll tell
[7:27] you if it's to tell you
[7:29] and then i'm afraid that if i say
[7:30] something a little too strong it might
[7:32] hurt somebody and
[7:33] you know it's uh you just have to almost
[7:36] just get to the platform and feel led to
[7:38] say what you're going to say that's all
[7:40] and then sometimes you might say
[7:42] something and
[7:43] someone would get the another slant to
[7:46] it
[7:46] and they'd run off on that side and then
[7:49] somebody say oh this is this
[7:50] but i want you to know that what i'm
[7:52] going to say
[7:53] is just pursuing and the word pursue
[7:57] means to adventure without authority so
[8:00] uh i
[8:00] am uh i don't say that this is true but
[8:03] it's just a little
[8:04] thought that i might drop along to you
[8:07] that you might
[8:07] weigh it out and see what you think
[8:10] about it
[8:11] and then it'll of course it'll be
[8:14] scriptural because i wouldn't preach
[8:15] nothing but
[8:16] is that the hour yet has this arrived to
[8:18] this hour
[8:20] and uh has these things meant that
[8:24] i pray with all that's what's in me
[8:27] that it isn't i pray that it
[8:30] isn't right that it isn't that it's
[8:33] going to be
[8:35] but has it come to that time yet that's
[8:38] what i want
[8:38] everybody understands thoroughly that i
[8:40] don't know i just
[8:42] is it this time if it is god be merciful
[8:46] to us
[8:46] but if it is in that time that it's
[8:49] going to come
[8:51] now as soon as we can we got a great
[8:54] itinerary in front of the lord willing
[8:56] and i've got to go overseas right after
[8:59] christmas

[9:06] the united states for a few services and
[9:08] then it go back
[9:09] down into south africa beginning on the
[9:11] second of

[9:16] second i think to about the 10th and
[9:18] then have

[10:55] now uh let us turn in the bible now and
[11:00] and expect the lord to give us of his
[11:02] blessings and we want to read
[11:04] some scriptures i got some scriptures
[11:06] wrote down here that i want to
[11:07] refer to and some notes and i want to
[11:10] read out of three places out of the
[11:12] bible and i'll give them to you first
[11:14] i want to read in jude five and six
[11:17] jude's just one book you know
[11:19] and then i want to read second peter the
[11:22] second chapter
[11:23] four and five now i want to read first
[11:26] peter
[11:27] 3 18-20
[11:30] and my subject this morning the lord
[11:32] willing is
[11:33] souls that are in prison now
[11:37] souls that are in prison now shut up
[11:42] forever condemned never
[11:45] no way of being saved see souls
[11:49] that have been imprisoned now
[11:52] now let's read over in the book of jude
[11:55] first i believe i have
[11:57] mark down here for the first place in
[11:58] jude and then over in second peter
[12:01] and then um oh then over first peter now
[12:04] jude
[12:05] uh would like to read it all but just to
[12:08] save
[12:08] time because it's 10 30 already i'm
[12:11] going to begin with the fifth verse
[12:13] now jude was a brother foster brother of
[12:17] jesus christ as we all know
[12:19] he was joseph's son
[12:23] i will therefore put you in remembrance
[12:26] though you once knew this
[12:28] how that the lord having saved the
[12:30] people out of the land of
[12:32] egypt afterwards destroyed them
[12:35] that believe not
[12:39] saved them first brought them out of
[12:41] egypt and then had to destroy them
[12:42] because they didn't continue with their
[12:44] message you see
[12:46] and the angels which kept not their
[12:48] first estate
[12:50] but left their own habitation
[12:54] he has reserved in everlasting change
[12:57] on chains under darkness unto
[13:00] the judgment of the great day
[13:06] angels which once stayed in heaven
[13:10] and kept not their estate and the way
[13:13] that they were in
[13:15] fell away and now is an
[13:18] eternal chains of darkness everlasting
[13:20] chains of darkness
[13:22] kept in this condition until the
[13:24] judgment of the great day when they'll
[13:26] be judged with
[13:27] all the rest of the unbelievers now
[13:30] in second peter the second chapter
[13:33] beginning with the fourth verse
[13:37] which will be just a book or two behind
[13:39] it
[13:41] for if god spared not the angels that
[13:44] sin
[13:45] but cast them down to hell
[13:48] and delivered them into chains of
[13:50] darkness to be reserved into judgment
[13:54] and spared not the old world
[13:59] but saved noah and eight persons a
[14:02] preacher
[14:02] of righteousness bringing in the flood
[14:05] upon the world
[14:07] of the ungodly
[14:10] spared not the angels put them in chains
[14:14] of darkness
[14:15] and condemned the whole world by the
[14:18] destruction of
[14:19] of noah now in first peter
[14:23] the first chapter and the first peter
[14:26] the third chapter and beginning with the
[14:28] 18th verse we read
[14:32] again now listen close now
[14:35] for christ also has once suffered for
[14:39] sins the just for the unjust
[14:43] that he might bring us to god being put
[14:46] to death
[14:47] in the flesh but quickened by the spirit
[14:50] but to death in the flesh but quickened
[14:53] by the spirit
[14:55] by which also he went and preached unto
[14:58] the spirits
[14:59] in prison he preached to these people
[15:03] in prison which sometimes were
[15:06] disobedient
[15:08] when once the long suffering of god
[15:12] waited in the days of noah while the ark
[15:15] was
[15:16] a preparing wherein few that is eight
[15:19] souls were saved
[15:21] by water
[15:28] like figure warranty even baptism does
[15:31] also now
[15:32] save us not the putting away of the
[15:35] filth of the flesh but the answering
[15:38] of a good conscience towards god by the
[15:41] resurrection
[15:42] of jesus christ who has gone into heaven
[15:46] and is on the right hand of god
[15:49] angels and authorities and powers being
[15:52] made
[15:52] subject unto him
[15:56] let's pray again now heavenly father
[16:00] such a a line of scripture here
[16:04] three witnesses three
[16:08] places in the scripture giving testimony
[16:12] and thou hast said in thy word that in
[16:14] the mouth of
[16:15] two or three witnesses
[16:18] let every word be established now
[16:22] i pray thee o god that thou
[16:26] will come to the people and will
[16:28] interpret this
[16:29] word this message
[16:32] in the light that it should be in that
[16:34] every man woman boy or girl
[16:37] might understand in the capacity that
[16:40] you
[16:40] have ordained for them to understand him
[16:44] and now knowing that these three
[16:46] witnesses bear record of truth
[16:49] and i pray that you will send the holy
[16:53] spirit upon us now
[16:54] and we'll look to him who
[16:57] is our king in our midst this morning
[17:01] the lord jesus christ where we have
[17:04] raised now by
[17:05] faith sitting in these heavenly places
[17:08] in him
[17:09] we wait for his message speaketh through
[17:12] us lord
[17:13] hear it through us as we ask you to
[17:16] circumcise the lips that speak
[17:19] and the ears that hear that it might be
[17:21] to the honor and glory
[17:23] of him who is the scripture for we asked
[17:27] it in his name
[17:30] amen
[17:34] now remember the services tonight
[17:37] a healing service i don't think it'd be
[17:39] necessary to give out prayer cards so we
[17:41] just
[17:42] pray for the sake i have something i
[17:45] want to tell you and i
[17:46] i hope that it'll just bring the
[17:48] congregation into a place to where
[17:49] there'll just be all kinds of healing
[17:51] i know it will be if we'll just believe
[17:54] it that way
[17:56] now this
[18:00] souls now in prison souls that are now
[18:04] in prison
[18:05] now the soul of man is not the body of
[18:08] man
[18:08] it's the soul and the soul is something
[18:11] that's uh
[18:12] the nature of the spirit and then when
[18:15] the nature
[18:16] of a man when he said we are dead
[18:20] the scripture plainly tells us that we
[18:22] are dead and our lives are hitting god
[18:24] through christ
[18:25] sealed there by the holy spirit now it
[18:28] wasn't that your body died
[18:30] it wasn't your spirit died it was the
[18:33] nature of your spirit died see
[18:36] the nature which is the soul the nature
[18:38] of your
[18:40] soul is uh is god
[18:43] if you're born again if it's not it's
[18:45] out of the world
[18:46] anything that begin has to end
[18:50] so therefore the only way that you can
[18:52] have eternal life
[18:54] is to have a life that never did begin
[18:57] and then your life did begin when you
[18:59] were born when god breathed the
[19:01] breath of life into your nostrils and
[19:03] you became a living soul
[19:05] then you begin then but when you
[19:09] that nature that was in you by nature
[19:11] you was of the world
[19:13] alienated from god you were actually an
[19:16] animal that's exactly right anyone knows
[19:19] that we're a mammal how many knows that
[19:21] we
[19:21] we are mammal we are a warm a blooded
[19:25] animal but that is what we are
[19:28] by our earthly creation but you see what
[19:31] made us different from other
[19:33] mammals that god put a soul upon us
[19:37] see now the other mammals don't have to
[19:39] wear clothes no other animal has to wear
[19:41] clothes to hide his shame
[19:42] but us we're the only ones that because
[19:46] we have a soul but see god
[19:49] in the beginning knew what a man would
[19:52] be like
[19:53] and he created the earth and brought up
[19:54] all kinds of animals
[19:56] from the very lowest to the highest and
[19:58] the highest animal come forth
[20:00] was man and then first man was made he
[20:04] was a spirit man
[20:06] in the image of god which god is a
[20:08] spirit saint john 4.
[20:10] now he is a a spirit and they that
[20:13] worship him worship him in spirit and
[20:15] in truth and thy word is the truth now
[20:19] we worship him his spirit and truth he
[20:21] is a
[20:22] a spirit being
[20:34] [Music]
[20:46] [Music]
[20:52] actually there's a helicopter and drop
[20:53] you in that's the only way that we can
[20:55] possibly get you there but i would love
[20:57] to go now
[20:58] this is the the old church building that
[21:01] they had and all the congregation
[21:02] met together in that church building
[21:04] just to show you where it is it's right
[21:06] in the center
[21:07] and again i can't i can't do this the
[21:10] uh right in the center where the word
[21:12] tanzania is you see there's no roads
[21:14] there's no
[21:14] cities this is just jungle wilderness
[21:18] area
[21:18] conservation areas where a lot of the
[21:21] animals roman tribal people live
[21:23] so this is very primitive many people
[21:25] who live here live in
[21:27] houses that are built in the ground in
[21:29] the dirt
[21:30] and and they're probably four or four
[21:32] and a half feet tall
[21:34] and they keep all their animals in there
[21:36] overnight every night because people
[21:37] will steal their animals and
[21:39] these are very very primitive people
[21:42] well let me introduce you to somebody
[21:44] who's
[21:44] in that uh village uh these are the this
[21:47] is uh the brother on your
[21:49] on your left uh his brother elias
[21:51] palangio and he's the pastor in arusha
[21:54] there
[21:54] and the other brother is brother theo
[21:56] and he is a missionary of missionaries
[21:58] he travels
[21:59] in very remote remote parts of the world
[22:02] of this world
[22:03] we bought three motorcycles for the
[22:05] missionaries there and they just
[22:06] crisscrossed the country
[22:08] they were they wrote me and said they
[22:10] traveled through a game reserve
[22:12] by motorbike for seven hours on bad or
[22:15] no roads
[22:15] many times there are no roads that go
[22:18] there
[22:18] and so this is the inside of the church
[22:21] at gungah
[22:22] and they wanted to go and visit the
[22:24] saints there because they hadn't been
[22:25] there in a long time
[22:27] there's seven people in this picture and
[22:29] two children
[22:30] and there's another sister who's not in
[22:32] the picture right here but
[22:33] that's the church in gungah they don't
[22:35] have a pastor and
[22:37] so they do the very best they can they
[22:39] said little bible studies and sometimes
[22:41] they'll read a book or they'll listen to
[22:43] a tape that's all they have
[22:45] unless the missionaries come through so
[22:47] it's very difficult for them
[22:48] in that part of the world to have any
[22:50] type of regular services at all
[22:52] i asked brother elias he's getting ready
[22:54] to preach there and i asked him what
[22:55] it's like to preach in that church he
[22:56] said well
[22:57] there's two things he said you don't
[22:58] want to stand up quickly as you'll bang
[23:00] your head
[23:01] and he said the second thing is you pray
[23:03] it doesn't rain
[23:04] because if it rains everybody goes home
[23:06] and they wait until the rain
[23:08] stops and then they come back again and
[23:09] finish the service that's just the way
[23:10] that it is
[23:12] let me introduce you to sister maria
[23:14] sister maria ese
[23:16] is the sister on the right and the red
[23:18] over here and
[23:19] she is married to a man who is a who was
[23:22] a muslim and he was a polygamist had
[23:24] several wives
[23:25] and this is him right here he's
[23:27] considered a wealthy man in that village
[23:29] because he owned two cows
[23:31] and had his own house now sister maria
[23:34] because they're considered on the
[23:36] wealthy side in that village
[23:38] she for a number of uh a
[23:41] number of years would just glean in the
[23:43] field she was truly was a gleaner
[23:45] and would gather the stubble that's left
[23:48] over and sell it in the marketplace and
[23:50] save up her funds
[23:51] now the interesting thing about sister
[23:53] maria is that she was a muslim as well
[23:55] and she has relatives who live in
[23:57] another part of tanzania who are in the
[23:59] message
[24:00] and she didn't know anything about that
[24:01] but one one a couple of years ago
[24:04] she decided to go and visit those
[24:05] relatives who were in the message
[24:07] in another part of tanzania and when she
[24:09] went they witnessed to her
[24:11] it was just the right time and the right
[24:14] word given to her and she just
[24:15] embraced the message she was baptized in
[24:18] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[24:19] she believes the message
[24:20] just like you do so she left home a
[24:23] muslim
[24:24] one of the wives of a polygamist and
[24:26] came back
[24:27] a believer well the family back home
[24:30] obviously i mean your reaction is is i
[24:33] mean you
[24:33] you've reacted but you can imagine how
[24:34] they must have reacted
[24:36] because here now she is talk carrying a
[24:38] bible she's talking about a prophet
[24:40] she's talking about the end time
[24:42] and all the things like we would believe
[24:44] she's witnessing those things back home
[24:46] and so the family says well the only
[24:48] thing we can do to straighten this
[24:49] situation out is to kill her
[24:51] so the first thing they did was to fill
[24:53] her cook stove with explosive gas
[24:56] they have a burning gas and then they
[24:58] have an explosive gas
[25:00] and sister maria was back home she
[25:01] didn't know they did this but they
[25:03] figured it would explode and kill her
[25:05] and she had her hand on the knob to turn
[25:07] on her little stove and
[25:08] she just she just felt no it's not going
[25:11] to do it she took the
[25:12] gas canister outside and unscrewed it
[25:14] and she smelled it immediately and it
[25:16] was full of
[25:17] explosive gas and so she just poured it
[25:18] out
[25:20] so the family said all right we have our
[25:22] we have another way to do it and
[25:24] we'll just poison her now let me assure
[25:26] you in that part of the world they know
[25:27] how to poison people
[25:28] all right they still have blow darts and
[25:30] they still have poison tip arrows
[25:32] they know how to stop an elephant in
[25:34] their tracks and they know how to poison
[25:35] somebody
[25:36] they watch sister maria ingest poison
[25:40] and it never affected her it never
[25:43] affected her
[25:44] naturally then they became afraid and
[25:46] they said we better leave her alone
[25:49] so they just let her be
[25:51] [Applause]
[25:55] sister maria in her gleaning she wanted
[25:57] to have a bigger church for her
[25:59] community
[26:00] she wanted to have something a little
[26:01] bit more reputable because
[26:03] you know it's nice when ministers come
[26:04] to have a nice place like you have here
[26:06] and it's also you know in the village
[26:09] people would mock them because they had
[26:11] a little
[26:12] church made of sticks and they said is
[26:14] your god only this big that he can make
[26:15] a church this big
[26:16] made of sticks and so she wanted to have
[26:18] a church for the
[26:20] for the local body there so she would
[26:22] gather gleanings from the field and sell
[26:24] them and buy bricks she would just save
[26:25] up the bricks and over time
[26:27] by herself she managed to hire a
[26:31] bricklayer
[26:31] and build this by herself just
[26:34] gleaning in the fields so when brother
[26:37] elias told me this story and showed me
[26:38] this picture
[26:39] i said oh okay you need money to finish
[26:41] the church put a roof on there
[26:43] i said it's no problem we could probably
[26:44] help you do that and he said no he said
[26:46] sister maria
[26:47] sent a message to you through me and she
[26:50] said
[26:51] don't worry about the church we built
[26:53] this much we'll finish the rest
[26:55] we don't need money for the church we
[26:57] want you to send money
[26:59] to bring ministers into this village
[27:02] because even if we have a church or we
[27:05] don't have a church or we have a roof or
[27:06] we don't have a roof
[27:08] none of that's going to give us
[27:09] rapturing faith it's the word that gives
[27:11] us rapturing faith
[27:13] and she said we want we want a minister
[27:16] to come and preach to us so
[27:17] if brother bear is going to send any
[27:19] funds send them to the missionaries who
[27:21] can come on their motorbikes
[27:22] and come in and preach for us that's
[27:24] really what we want until god raises up
[27:26] a pastor
[27:27] well i told this story enough around
[27:29] that you know people sent money and they
[27:32] decided to go ahead and put the roof on
[27:34] there so
[27:35] we've got a fund set up so the
[27:36] missionaries travel in there on a
[27:38] regular basis and
[27:39] uh the uh the the church now uh
[27:42] was being completed and they were just
[27:43] so excited about that
[27:45] so now this is the picture at the end of
[27:48] the story
[27:49] if you look over on your right there's
[27:51] the old church
[27:54] so now we've got a skyscraper i mean in
[27:56] goonga this is a skyscraper folks
[27:59] this is this is like uh i mean this is
[28:02] like the mall of america
[28:03] this in terms of size but they're just
[28:06] excited
[28:06] and but here's the thing as brother
[28:08] branham said you know
[28:10] the things that were at the beginning
[28:12] they're repeated at the end
[28:14] so as a result of this now uh the whole
[28:17] village is standing back and looking at
[28:19] this and saying
[28:20] wow they do serve a real god a living
[28:22] god who's able to turn that little thing
[28:23] into something great like this
[28:25] and this is the end of the story this is
[28:28] sister maria's husband the muslim
[28:30] being baptized in the name of the lord
[28:32] jesus christ
[28:32] [Applause]
[28:38] [Music]
[28:40] i love to tell that story because it's
[28:42] just a great complete little story
[28:44] testimony and uh you know their hearts
[28:46] were just so set not on having a fancy
[28:48] building but they just wanted to have
[28:49] the gospel preached
[28:51] and and that was their desire and i
[28:52] thought wow those are the kind of people
[28:54] you love to help
[28:55] we'll probably never meet the people
[28:58] from gunga
[28:58] on this side of eternity but when you
[29:00] get there i'll guarantee you they'll be
[29:02] over there
[29:03] seven or eight of them i believe they'll
[29:04] all be over there on the other side
[29:12] [Music]
[29:24] you
