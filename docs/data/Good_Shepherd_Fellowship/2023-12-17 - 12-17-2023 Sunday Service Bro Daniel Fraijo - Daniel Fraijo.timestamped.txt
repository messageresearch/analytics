[35:04] uh for all his goodness his grace and
[35:07] mercy praise the lord we just just got
[35:10] in this morning from uh
[35:14] uh Atlanta fluing and just got ready for
[35:17] church immediately
[35:19] so uh uh we were away on the weekend
[35:23] like we told you on Wednesday night for
[35:26] sister Jim wedding they had a good
[35:28] wedding so we thank the Lord for that
[35:31] and uh we
[35:34] also saw a few of the brothers that sent
[35:36] their
[35:37] greetings and
[35:41] uh right after service uh like we
[35:44] announced on Wednesday night we'll have
[35:48] uh
[35:50] uh the children young people we have
[35:53] their
[35:55] their little meeting with with brother
[35:58] Ariel now what uh what I think is all
[36:01] about uh I know I was hinting so I'm not
[36:04] guessing I'm not Discerning I'm just on
[36:06] it I don't have all of the details so
[36:09] that's what I'm saying what I think it
[36:11] is I think over the over the years uh
[36:14] brother uh through the year brother a
[36:17] been
[36:18] scheduling
[36:21] uh tip playing with the young people and
[36:25] then uh uh coming out with uh with a
[36:28] quest after the listening to a tape and
[36:31] then he he question them so I think uh
[36:35] uh they have just gone through their
[36:37] last step and uh uh so I think there
[36:42] something they want to do with them
[36:44] after the
[36:45] service but if you remember at the
[36:48] beginning of uh uh that whole series we
[36:54] we encourage you parents uh
[36:57] uh especially with the little ones to be
[37:00] able to make time and uh
[37:04] uh either follow up with them or
[37:09] listening you know with them just to be
[37:13] able to create uh that atmosphere or
[37:18] create a form of edication that will be
[37:20] able to help them uh uh in uh listening
[37:27] to the message of the
[37:29] hour we know uh everything that is
[37:32] happening out there we don't want to go
[37:34] into the fces and everything that is
[37:36] going on around but we also have to
[37:39] realize that we have this
[37:42] responsibility as as parents according
[37:44] to the book of Deuteronomy
[37:47] Moses told the children of Israel going
[37:50] into the promised land he he Tau the
[37:52] parents their responsibility teach your
[37:55] children you know
[37:57] uh teach your children these uh
[38:01] Commandments of the word of the Lord WR
[38:03] it on your walls write it at your door
[38:05] post write it on your bed and uh uh and
[38:10] and teach them you know it's it's all
[38:13] about creating an atmosphere where the
[38:15] word will be able to find uh uh you know
[38:21] a place in their life so we want to
[38:24] thank uh our brother and his wife for
[38:26] the time that they put into working with
[38:29] uh uh the young people over the years I
[38:32] know there is that this is very common
[38:35] it's very very common for the fact that
[38:38] when people are given
[38:41] responsibility sometimes people watch
[38:43] and see how much the pastor is involved
[38:46] if the pastor is not involved it's not
[38:48] very important if he was if it was
[38:50] important he will be involved and uh uh
[38:55] uh and and and I think that's a wrong
[38:58] thing you know we are not able to do
[39:01] everything that's the reason why we God
[39:04] has given us people that we can trust to
[39:07] be able to to work let's support them
[39:10] let encourage them and uh and I think uh
[39:13] it will be a blessing praise the Lord so
[39:16] we want to thank our brother and his
[39:17] wife and then also uh
[39:22] uh
[39:25] uh brother area we'll be working with uh
[39:29] uh sister
[39:31] Naomi we want to do something uh uh or
[39:35] the the the young people the children
[39:38] want to do something uh for the coming
[39:41] Sunday so uh uh because of that uh we we
[39:47] we just want to put in a little time to
[39:49] get everything together so there will
[39:51] not be service on Wednesday night we
[39:55] will not have our regular service if we
[39:58] will have anything going on we will let
[40:00] you know but uh uh we will make time for
[40:04] some of the practice that they we want
[40:06] to do Wednesday night and then uh uh
[40:11] they will have uh uh their presentation
[40:14] on
[40:15] Sunday with that being said also we will
[40:18] we will encourage you parents if you've
[40:20] been working with your child privately
[40:23] uh maybe singing a song or
[40:26] reading uh a Prem or a scripture and you
[40:31] think that uh you would like them to be
[40:34] part of that it would be good to tell
[40:36] brother Ariel or sister Nomi and then
[40:39] they will need to
[40:40] practice they will need to
[40:43] practice if uh if any of the the
[40:46] children are part of the group they will
[40:49] need to be part of the
[40:51] practice so so we will not surprise
[40:54] ourself on Sunday
[40:57] again there is no service on Wednesday
[40:58] night so we can be able to give them
[41:01] time to uh uh put together whatever
[41:05] presentation that will be showing to us
[41:08] on Sunday that will be for the children
[41:11] there uh uh there the Christmas
[41:14] presentation so uh uh with that being
[41:18] said we want to use this time to greet

[46:59] words we'll speak this morning not
[47:02] everything will be for everyone but
[47:04] we're certainly believing that the holy
[47:06] spirit will have
[47:08] something a measure of something for
[47:10] each and every one of us here so we're
[47:13] thankful to be here this
[47:15] morning and we'd like to minister on a
[47:18] on a topic and and titled it the pattern
[47:21] of God's
[47:23] word and we'll be reading from
[47:25] revelation aans 10 uh
[47:28] 1-7 and just trying by the grace of God
[47:31] to to share it all with you and and
[47:34] though I might call it my
[47:36] Revelation unless God quickens into your
[47:39] hearts it may just be my opinion and
[47:43] that's okay that's okay if you can only
[47:46] receive it as my opinion but whether
[47:48] it's you receive it as my opinion or God
[47:51] gives you more
[47:52] revelation we are certainly looking
[47:54] forward to what God would speak this
[47:57] morning uh if you'll stand with your
[48:00] feet this
[48:05] morning and uh we'll be reading begin
[48:08] reading in Revelations 8 and verse
[48:12] one very familiar scripture to all of us
[48:16] or most of us I would have to say if
[48:18] you're a Bible reader if you're studying
[48:22] the message of this end time of God send
[48:25] a prophet fulfillment of Malachi
[48:29] 4:6 and he's long gone off the
[48:32] scene but there was a there was food
[48:35] laid up and stored up for us in this day
[48:38] and though and though the prophet went
[48:40] out the scene the the god of that
[48:42] Prophet is still with us here this
[48:44] morning Revelations 8 and verse one and
[48:48] it says and when he had opened the seven
[48:51] seal there was silence in heaven about
[48:54] the space of a half hour let's pray
[48:58] Heavenly Father we thank you this
[49:01] morning Lord Jesus just a few words and
[49:06] without your leadership your guidance
[49:08] your
[49:09] revelation we would never know the
[49:12] meaning of this but Lord this morning
[49:15] you've opened the book and you've loosed
[49:17] the Seven Seals and we thank you for
[49:20] that we pray Lord that you would open
[49:24] this book and loose these Seven Seals to
[49:27] everyone that it could become a personal
[49:29] experience this morning in Jesus name
[49:33] amen you may be
[49:37] seated I'd like to read a quote here
[49:41] from the message Christ The Mystery of
[49:42] God reveal paragraph
[49:45] 637 it says brother bam says not knowing
[49:49] of course but being spiritual he says
[49:52] you watch spiritual things he says not
[49:56] knowing this God knows it he's finishing
[49:58] up this message he's at the end of it
[50:01] he's preached for many hours already he
[50:03] saids but if you'll turn and look at the
[50:05] clock it's on the dot 2:00 the end of
[50:09] the second pole the third poll is at
[50:12] hand you see in his ministry God had
[50:16] showed him way back in
[50:18] 1946 where he met in a little old cabin
[50:21] and the angel of Lord come down and
[50:23] spoke to him and began to speak to him
[50:26] of the stages and changes in in his
[50:28] ministry and how it would become greater
[50:31] for a little flock called The Bride of
[50:34] Jesus Christ but for the world it would
[50:36] become less interesting all the time for
[50:39] the world they would be they would find
[50:40] it harder and harder to understand but
[50:43] for the Bride of Jesus Christ through
[50:45] Revelation she' be able to recognize her
[50:48] day and its message you could recognize
[50:51] where we are today this day this morning
[50:55] where the word
[50:58] hases Prophet said the third pull was
[51:02] the opening of those Seven Seals to
[51:04] reveal the hidden truth that that's been
[51:06] sealed in the word the message anointed
[51:09] ones at the end time
[51:11] 1965 believe it's paragraph 262 he said
[51:14] this notice the very day when this
[51:17] messenger not when he starts on but when
[51:20] he begins to declare his message see the
[51:23] first pole was healing the the second
[51:25] PLL prophesying the third poll the
[51:27] opening of the word the Mysteries
[51:30] revealed no more there's no more higher
[51:33] order to reveal the word than prophets
[51:36] but the only way the prophet can be
[51:37] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[51:40] the third poll was the opening of them
[51:43] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[51:46] that's been sealed in the word he says
[51:48] do you see it and they didn't see it but
[51:52] the question still is today even more do
[51:55] you you see it this
[52:01] morning there's always been a question
[52:04] of what happened on Sunset
[52:07] Mountain I used to live in a city Tucson
[52:10] Arizona about 3 and 1 half hour drive to
[52:13] Sunset Mountain we've been there many
[52:15] times but it's what happened on Sunset
[52:18] Mountain he he says in the message what
[52:21] is the attraction on the mountain 1965
[52:24] paragraph 14 8 he said what's happened
[52:27] upon Mount
[52:28] Sunset God confirming his noise that's
[52:31] what all this noise is about notice it's
[52:33] God fulfilling his promised word again
[52:36] of Revelations 10: 1-7 now he con now he
[52:40] is
[52:40] connected he has connected for us
[52:43] Revelations 10 1-7 with what happened
[52:46] with a happening on Sunset Mountain
[52:50] connected keep that in mind as we go on
[52:52] notice it's God's fulfilling his
[52:54] promised word again of Revelations 10:
[52:56] 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of
[52:58] the seventh angel message the mystery of
[53:01] God should be finished the hidden
[53:03] Mystery of Revelations 10: 1-7 the last
[53:06] message to the last Church fulfills
[53:08] exactly in this age St Luke 1730 the day
[53:12] when the son of man shall be revealed in
[53:15] one paragraph he's connected so many
[53:18] things he's connected Revelations 10:1
[53:21] to the Mount Sunset experience he's
[53:24] connected re it's connected Luke 17:30
[53:27] to the Mount Sunset experience he
[53:29] connected the revealing of the son of
[53:31] man in our days to that mount Sunset
[53:33] experience are happening he says and
[53:35] there shall arise false prophets and
[53:37] false Christ show great signs and
[53:39] wonders in so much it deceived the
[53:42] elected if possible the people still in
[53:45] doubt and as usual the church is just as
[53:51] puzzled
[53:54] 1965 it's now
[53:56] 2023 and I dare to say the church is
[54:00] just as
[54:02] puzzled in the message the Feast of the
[54:05] trumpets again the prophets connecting
[54:08] pulling loose ends together for us he
[54:11] says in in this message Feast of the
[54:13] trumpets
[54:14] 1964 paragraph 264 look I want to say
[54:18] one more thing closely now don't miss
[54:20] this how striking from the seventh
[54:23] Angel's messenger of the seven seal
[54:26] message in Revelations 10 was the seven
[54:30] seal another connection what was that
[54:34] connection he now told us Revelations 10
[54:38] 1-7 was the seven seal we read a
[54:41] scripture Revelations 81 has maybe 18
[54:45] words in it we thought that's Hall how
[54:48] can we know what this seven seal is with
[54:50] just 18 Little Words a short little
[54:53] verse ah
[54:56] w we
[54:58] say now he's connected and he said
[55:01] Revelations look I want to say one more
[55:04] thing he said closely now don't miss
[55:07] this how striking the seventh Angels
[55:10] messenger of the seventh seal message in
[55:13] Revelations 10 was the seventh
[55:17] seal how many verses are there in
[55:19] Revelations 10 11 so now a prophet has
[55:23] just added 11 more verses to what is
[55:27] taking place and happening under the
[55:29] seven seal it's no longer just
[55:32] Revelations
[55:33] 81 now it's 11 more vers now we have 12
[55:37] verses giving us detail of what is the
[55:40] seven seal what's happening under that
[55:43] seal and yet the language itself of the
[55:47] Bible is designed to hide these truths
[55:50] from the eyes of the wise and simple the
[55:52] wise and prudent and reveal it unto to
[55:55] babes such as would learn seals seals
[55:58] seals what is seals
[56:01] well I have in my
[56:04] pocket it's not a very good
[56:07] one
[56:11] but it's the best I could
[56:14] do
[56:16] improvising in brother bl's
[56:21] office the Bible was written in Scrolls
[56:25] and what held the scrolled shut was
[56:28] called a
[56:33] seal and when the seal was
[56:35] [Music]
[56:39] removed that's all the seal was
[56:42] for it was to hold the Scrolls
[56:45] shut and the seal was removed with a
[56:48] soulle purpose to unfold the scroll and
[56:53] reveal the message within
[56:55] yeah and in this message they're
[56:57] fighting over what is seals what is Seal
[56:59] what is seals that's it right
[57:02] there that's it that was the seal but
[57:06] when you loose it it opens the book and
[57:09] it reveals a
[57:11] message a plan a Sevenfold Plan of
[57:14] Redemption of restoration of God coming
[57:18] down to change our
[57:21] lives and The World Keeps fighting over
[57:24] what what is a
[57:29] Seal Seal Seal
[57:32] seals who's speaking about the message
[57:34] the message the message the word of God
[57:38] thus sayith the
[57:43] Lord look I want to say one more thing
[57:46] closely now don't miss this how
[57:48] striking from the seventh Angel's
[57:52] messenger of the seventh seal
[57:55] now he's connected the seventh angel as
[57:58] the messenger of the seventh seal
[58:00] message in Revelations 10 was the
[58:03] seventh seal now he's telling us
[58:05] Revelations
[58:07] 10 that's the seventh seal with more
[58:11] detail was the seven seal to the seven
[58:14] trumpets between those two times oh God
[58:18] can we say this how can we say this to
[58:22] make the people see it that revelation
[58:25] 10 was the seven
[58:33] seal back in
[58:36] 1963 I'm met my home there in Tucson
[58:39] just a young
[58:41] boy and uh there's a knock on the door
[58:44] at our
[58:45] home my father opens a door and it was a
[58:49] brother his name was Daniel ramidus and
[58:53] he had with him a little
[58:55] brochure two or three pages at the most
[58:57] it was and it was a it was a brochure of
[59:02] a Science magazine and the man and the
[59:06] scientist that had put it together was
[59:08] called James E
[59:10] MacDonald the issue was April the 19th
[59:13] 1963 he was the leading scientist at the
[59:16] University of Arizona in Tucson Arizona
[59:20] and he had put this out during the time
[59:23] when this Myster ious Cloud appeared in
[59:25] the heavens and he writes this an
[59:29] unusual ring-shaped Cloud was widely
[59:31] observed over Northern Arizona near
[59:34] Sunset on 20 the 28th of February 1963
[59:40] from a large number of absorbers reports
[59:43] it's known to have appeared overhead
[59:45] near Flagstaff Arizona from initial
[59:48] computations based on four photos taken
[59:50] in Tucson 190 Mi south of the cloud
[59:55] its altitude was approximately 35
[59:58] km as a young boy I'm listening to this
[1:00:01] brother passionate excited reading this
[1:00:04] science this no this little brochure
[1:00:06] from this Science
[1:00:08] magazine he said the most distant Opera
[1:00:11] obser observation reported was made 280
[1:00:14] mies from the cloud the cloud remained
[1:00:16] sunlit for 28 minutes after local Sunset
[1:00:21] iridescence was noted by many observers
[1:00:24] Tech tentatively the cloud may be
[1:00:26] regarded as similar to a narus cloud but
[1:00:31] it's unusually great
[1:00:33] height unusually low altitude plus its
[1:00:37] remarkable shape suggests that it was a
[1:00:40] cloud a previously unrecorded
[1:00:46] type remember John when he saw the
[1:00:50] vision and there in Revelations 8 one he
[1:00:56] says and when he had opened the seven
[1:00:58] seal he the lamb had opened the seven
[1:01:01] seal and when he had opened the seven
[1:01:05] seal there was silence in heaven about
[1:01:08] the space of half an hour I doubt John
[1:01:12] even knew what the word half an hour
[1:01:15] meant because they didn't tell time as
[1:01:18] we tell time
[1:01:19] today they didn't divide it in the same
[1:01:23] fashion and yet that was the language
[1:01:26] that he used that was the language that
[1:01:28] God wanted him to use that was what God
[1:01:31] wanted him to
[1:01:33] say because over 2,000 years later he
[1:01:37] would cause a
[1:01:39] scientist to
[1:01:42] determine
[1:01:43] exactly how long that
[1:01:46] was and when we read this report on the
[1:01:49] Science magazine
[1:01:51] here this scientist Dr McDonald
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:01:56] he tells
[1:01:58] us that it was
[1:02:00] sunlit for 28
[1:02:04] minutes science tells us to the minute
[1:02:09] wow John said it was about the space of
[1:02:12] a half
[1:02:13] hour the scientists God has them to
[1:02:17] testify that's true as a matter of fact
[1:02:19] we timed it it was exactly 28
[1:02:23] minutes God has scientists to
[1:02:29] testify
[1:02:31] God rich in
[1:02:33] Mercy science said it was it was a cloud
[1:02:39] remarkable shape a cloud of previously
[1:02:43] unrecorded type
[1:02:46] scientifically unrecorded of science but
[1:02:49] recorded in God's holy
[1:02:51] word if you like turn with me to Acts
[1:02:54] chapter 1 beginning at verse
[1:02:56] 7 you remember what was taking place
[1:02:59] here Jesus had appeared amongst the
[1:03:02] disciples he had resurrected he had been
[1:03:05] seen amongst them for 40 days and he was
[1:03:07] he had just ascended and in Revelations
[1:03:10] in Acts 1:7 it goes like this and he
[1:03:14] said unto them it is not for you to know
[1:03:16] the times or the seasons which the
[1:03:18] father have put in his own
[1:03:19] power but ye shall receive power after
[1:03:22] that the Holy Ghost has come upon on you
[1:03:25] and you shall be Witnesses unto me both
[1:03:27] in Jerusalem and all Judea and in
[1:03:29] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[1:03:31] the earth and when he had spoken these
[1:03:33] things while they beheld he was taken up
[1:03:36] and a cloud received them out of their
[1:03:39] sight a cloud received him out of their
[1:03:43] sight and while they looked steadfastly
[1:03:45] toward Heaven as he went up behold two
[1:03:47] men stood by them in white apparel which
[1:03:51] also said ye men of Galilee
[1:03:54] why stand ye gazing up into heaven this
[1:03:57] same Jesus which is taken up from you
[1:04:00] into heaven shall so come in like manner
[1:04:04] as you have seen him go into heaven now
[1:04:08] we know now we can say This Cloud that
[1:04:13] Jesus was caught up into it wasn't just
[1:04:16] a cloud it just just it wasn't formed by
[1:04:19] D Drops this was seven angels the same
[1:04:22] seven angels that took them up here is
[1:04:25] the same seven angels 2,000 years later
[1:04:28] he come down again to declare it's his
[1:04:30] second coming oh Lord Isaiah said in
[1:04:35] Isaiah 289 and 10 Whom Shall he teach
[1:04:38] knowledge Whom Shall he make to
[1:04:40] understand Doctrine them that are wean
[1:04:42] from the milk and drawn from the breast
[1:04:45] them that have come out of apostolic and
[1:04:47] Pentecostal and Catholic
[1:04:49] denominations the best they could give
[1:04:52] them was milk but you can't raise a
[1:04:54] person to adulthood strong on milk he's
[1:04:56] got to have meat he must have precept
[1:04:59] upon precept and blind upon line here a
[1:05:03] little in a message from 1946 and here a
[1:05:06] little from a message of
[1:05:09] 1963 now now we
[1:05:13] begin that was extra now we're now we're
[1:05:16] going to get into God's word Revelations
[1:05:19] 10 and verse
[1:05:21] 1 and remember what is revelation
[1:05:25] 10 this is the seventh seal this is
[1:05:28] details of the happening under the
[1:05:31] seventh
[1:05:33] seal so we no longer have just one verse
[1:05:36] Revelations 81 now we have 12 verses of
[1:05:40] detail of what would happen at the
[1:05:43] opening and the process unfolding under
[1:05:46] this seven
[1:05:48] seal but is it really the seven
[1:05:53] seal or is it a seventh
[1:05:56] message is it a book that's been open to
[1:05:59] us the Lamb's Book of Life that's what

[1:06:14] cloud seven
[1:06:17] angels on Sunset mountain and a rainbow
[1:06:20] was upon his head a covenant Angel C
[1:06:24] himself and his face was it was as it
[1:06:27] were the
[1:06:28] son the same son that was above that
[1:06:32] woman in Revelations 12 John said and I
[1:06:35] saw a woman great with child I saw her
[1:06:38] in heaven he
[1:06:41] said a woman about to have a baby in
[1:06:46] heaven I I thought there was no babies
[1:06:48] in
[1:06:50] heaven you see I'm already getting ready
[1:06:52] to go off on another subject
[1:06:56] I'll leave that Revelations 10:1 and I
[1:06:59] saw another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:07:01] heaven clothe with a cloud and a rainbow
[1:07:03] upon his head and his face as it were
[1:07:05] the sun his feet as pillars of fire and
[1:07:08] he had in his hand a little book open
[1:07:11] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:07:14] and his left on the foot on the
[1:07:18] earth the sea that he put his right foot
[1:07:20] upon is a multitude of peoples a gentile
[1:07:23] people
[1:07:24] and his left foot on the Earth was right
[1:07:26] down on Jerusalem the promised land the
[1:07:29] Jewish people because he was descending
[1:07:32] to restore he was descending to make
[1:07:35] take possession of his people of his
[1:07:38] bride of his church modern events here
[1:07:42] being made clear by prophecy to
[1:07:45] us in the message modern events made
[1:07:48] clear by prophecy paragraph
[1:07:50] 61 Prophet says this these Modern event
[1:07:54] is slipping by us too swiftly and one
[1:07:57] day we're going to find out we'll be
[1:07:58] left behind without nothing and be
[1:08:01] caught sealed into the mark of the beast
[1:08:04] before we know it now and with patience
[1:08:07] we have to wait for this for the
[1:08:09] prophecies that's promise every one of
[1:08:11] them must be fulfilled in its age for it
[1:08:14] foretells the author has before done
[1:08:17] this just like this Cloud these seven
[1:08:19] angels on Sunset Mountain you realize
[1:08:22] now the author had for done
[1:08:28] this and we wait to see him do it again
[1:08:31] what a time it is that we're living in
[1:08:34] like a calendar you look at the calendar
[1:08:36] to find out what day of the year you're
[1:08:37] living in you look at God's Bible to see
[1:08:39] what age we're living in we're not
[1:08:41] living in a Methodist age the Baptist
[1:08:43] age we're living in the bright
[1:08:47] Age The Calling bringing back to God
[1:08:51] through a channel that he promised to
[1:08:53] bring it back
[1:08:54] he promised to do it so Revelations
[1:08:58] 10 it's the bride
[1:09:01] age in the message this day the
[1:09:04] scriptures
[1:09:06] fulfilled paragraph
[1:09:09] 175 Prophet says this and I stood there
[1:09:12] a little bit till the Holy Spirit
[1:09:14] revealed it to revealed it I said the
[1:09:17] entire Bible as much has been revealed
[1:09:20] to man through justification
[1:09:22] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:25] Ghost the baptism in jesus' name and all
[1:09:28] these things has been revealed but
[1:09:30] there's secrets that hid inside because
[1:09:32] the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals I
[1:09:35] must go there to find it oh we ought to
[1:09:39] have that same feeling in our hearts
[1:09:41] when we read these things I too must go
[1:09:45] there to find it I too must meditate on
[1:09:48] his word night and day to find it
[1:09:52] amen you can find it because it's a
[1:09:55] promise to you he said that morning when
[1:09:58] those seven angels came down and blasted
[1:10:00] the Earth rocks flew everywhere seven
[1:10:02] angels stood there and said return back
[1:10:04] to Jeffersonville from where you came
[1:10:06] from for the Seven Seals of the seven
[1:10:09] Mysteries will be
[1:10:11] open it was
[1:10:13] 1974 and for the first time I went to
[1:10:16] Sunset
[1:10:17] Mountain you're no longer allowed to go
[1:10:19] there it's all closed down now new new
[1:10:22] owners that know not Joseph how haveit
[1:10:25] now but when I when I walked into that
[1:10:29] area and a prophet said it was a blast
[1:10:32] and it looked like a blade had just
[1:10:34] chopped everything to one high you could
[1:10:37] go there almost 10 years later 9 years
[1:10:42] later and those trees still were all
[1:10:45] like they'd been cut at the same
[1:10:48] Hive he said here we are today
[1:10:51] understanding serpent SE
[1:10:54] in a few days of God willing will
[1:10:56] understand the correctness of marriage
[1:10:58] and divorce
[1:10:59] 1965 he said here we are we're
[1:11:03] understanding serpent
[1:11:05] seed but not all in
[1:11:09] 2023 in a few days if God willing
[1:11:13] will'll understand the correctness of
[1:11:15] marriage and
[1:11:17] divorce but not all in
[1:11:21] 2023 when a prophet preached marriage
[1:11:23] and
[1:11:24] divorce the truth of it
[1:11:27] lays in the mouth of three
[1:11:30] Witnesses
[1:11:32] Moses Jesus and the Apostle
[1:11:36] Paul and how
[1:11:38] beautifully God used the seventh angel
[1:11:41] to tie it
[1:11:43] together all these things that God has
[1:11:45] opened every seal the mystery since the
[1:11:47] foundation of the world and we've been
[1:11:49] enjoying the presence of his Blessing
[1:11:51] that is true he says and then he says
[1:11:54] this day this scriptures fulfilled he
[1:11:57] said
[1:11:59] 1965 February the 19th this
[1:12:03] day it's now
[1:12:06] 2023 we ought to have this
[1:12:09] revelation we ought to lay in the word
[1:12:12] till we get
[1:12:14] it in the message the breach
[1:12:19] 1963 paragraph
[1:12:21] 39 now it's wrote mysterious because no
[1:12:25] man nowhere knows it God Alone Jesus
[1:12:28] Christ see it's a book A mysterious book
[1:12:31] it's the book of redemption we'll get
[1:12:33] into that a little while and now we know
[1:12:35] that this book of redemption will not
[1:12:37] thoroughly be understood it's probed
[1:12:39] that through six Church ages but at the
[1:12:42] end when the seventh angel begins to
[1:12:44] sound his mystery he winds up all the
[1:12:47] Loose Ends that these fellows probed it
[1:12:49] and the Mysteries come down from God as
[1:12:51] the word of God reveals the ti
[1:12:53] revelation of God then the godhead and
[1:12:57] everything else is settled all the
[1:12:58] Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more
[1:13:01] is to be revealed now you see I'm not
[1:13:04] just making that up it's thus saith the
[1:13:07] Lord he says I'll read it out of the
[1:13:09] book for
[1:13:12] you I'm reading out of the book today
[1:13:14] but it'll still require the Lamb of God
[1:13:17] the revealer to Open the Eyes of your
[1:13:20] understanding to see
[1:13:21] it he said I read it out of the book The
[1:13:24] sounding of the seventh angel message
[1:13:26] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:13:28] that's been declared by his holy
[1:13:30] prophets that's the prophets who wrote
[1:13:32] the word at the sounding of the seven
[1:13:34] Church age the last Church AG all the
[1:13:37] Loose Ends that's through these Church
[1:13:39] ages have been probed at will be wound
[1:13:41] up together and when the seals are broke
[1:13:45] and the Mysteries revealed down comes
[1:13:47] the angel the messenger Christ setting
[1:13:50] his foot upon the land and upon the the
[1:13:53] sea with a rainbow over his head now
[1:13:55] remember there seventh Angels on the
[1:13:58] earth at the time of his
[1:14:00] coming let me read that again and when
[1:14:04] the Seven Seals are broke the Mysteries
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:09] revealed where's the
[1:14:13] seal where's the message ought to be in
[1:14:16] our
[1:14:18] hearts Seven
[1:14:20] Seals is the book sealed I'll just make
[1:14:24] the statements
[1:14:25] and let let brother blatte fix it all
[1:14:29] later Seven Seals is the book
[1:14:33] sealed seven Thunders is the book
[1:14:36] revealed but Seven
[1:14:38] Virtues is the book
[1:14:40] living EP pistols read of all men in you
[1:14:43] and
[1:14:44] I it's a
[1:14:47] process and God doesn't want to stay at
[1:14:50] the top he wants to bring it to this
[1:14:53] book B is in you Christ in you the hope
[1:14:55] of
[1:14:57] glory and when the seals are brok the
[1:15:00] Mysteries revealed down comes the angel
[1:15:02] the messenger Christ that's Revelations
[1:15:04] 10:1 setting his foot upon the land
[1:15:08] setting his foot upon the sea putting
[1:15:11] his foot me means possession he's come
[1:15:14] to possess this Gentile bride he's come
[1:15:17] to possess His People Israel with a
[1:15:20] rainbow over his head a angel a covant
[1:15:23] angel now remember this seventh angel is
[1:15:27] on the earth at the time of his
[1:15:30] coming so what is Revelations 10
[1:15:33] Revelations 10 a prophet said it's the
[1:15:37] seven seal Revelations 10 he said it's
[1:15:41] the time of the Bride age Revelations 10
[1:15:44] he just told us it's his coming
[1:15:47] Revelations 10 is when the Seven Seals
[1:15:49] of God were opened there on the mountain
[1:15:52] he told us he said Revelations 10 it's
[1:15:55] the third
[1:15:56] pool Revelations
[1:15:59] 10 and the Seven Seals of God he
[1:16:03] said the question is when were they
[1:16:06] really open for the
[1:16:09] day aha I'm glad you asked me that
[1:16:12] question here it is in the message then
[1:16:15] inv visible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:16:18] just a month before brother Brandon
[1:16:20] passed away it was November the 25th
[1:16:23] paragraph 301 and the Seven Seals of God
[1:16:26] when it was opened there on the
[1:16:33] mountain now a book
[1:16:35] open doesn't mean it's a book
[1:16:38] revealed but it's
[1:16:42] open to be revealed to whosoever
[1:16:46] will to whosoever will meditate on this
[1:16:49] word night and
[1:16:51] day and the Seven seals of God when it
[1:16:54] was opened there on the mountain
[1:16:58] February
[1:17:00] 1963 let God he said no let me die right
[1:17:04] now at this Pulpit if that ain't the
[1:17:06] truth he
[1:17:09] said and I for told you and I for told
[1:17:13] you I told you a year and six months
[1:17:16] before it happened what he told me go to
[1:17:19] Arizona and what would happen out there
[1:17:21] in the desert and there's men sitting
[1:17:24] right here tonight was standing right
[1:17:26] there and present when the seven angels
[1:17:28] came down and even the magazine Life
[1:17:30] Magazine packed the article of it it's
[1:17:33] right there in the observatory and
[1:17:35] everything now they don't even know what
[1:17:38] it's all
[1:17:39] about Life Magazine packed the article
[1:17:43] it's right there in the observatory and
[1:17:45] everything and in
[1:17:48] 20123 most of this message movement they
[1:17:51] don't even know what it's on all
[1:17:55] about invisible Union of the bride of
[1:17:59] Christ the cloud was
[1:18:03] photographed February the 28th
[1:18:07] 1963 March the 17th
[1:18:11] 1963 William Brandon Begins the sounding
[1:18:14] of the seventh Angels M
[1:18:17] Ministry he begins it with God and
[1:18:21] simplicity
[1:18:24] the
[1:18:26] sounding he had his first po Ministry
[1:18:30] Evangelistic prayed for the
[1:18:33] sick but the sounding of his ministry
[1:18:35] had not begun
[1:18:37] there he had
[1:18:39] discernment Discerning the hearts of the
[1:18:41] people he told us himself how he had
[1:18:44] misused
[1:18:45] it
[1:18:47] improperly and it bothered him greatly
[1:18:49] that he
[1:18:51] had then we come to the third pool of
[1:18:53] his
[1:18:55] ministry So This Cloud that was
[1:18:57] photographed seven angels the same seven
[1:19:01] angels that were present when Jesus was
[1:19:04] caught up away am the first coming of
[1:19:07] Christ now they come
[1:19:10] again the second coming of
[1:19:13] Christ This Cloud was photographed on
[1:19:15] February the 28th
[1:19:18] 1963 March the 17th of
[1:19:21] 1963 will brandham Begins the sounding
[1:19:24] of the seventh angel Ministry with God
[1:19:27] and simplicity March the 24th he
[1:19:31] preaches the seven seal from the time
[1:19:35] the Angels appeared in the mountain to
[1:19:38] the time he preached the seven seal was
[1:19:40] 25 days so from the appearing of the
[1:19:44] cloud to the preaching of the Seven
[1:19:46] Seals 25
[1:19:50] days so from Revelations 101
[1:19:54] to Revelations 10:7 the unfolding and
[1:19:57] the
[1:19:58] Fulfillment takes place in
[1:20:01] 25
[1:20:03] days no brother brandom it had to have
[1:20:05] been
[1:20:06] years no surely it was 20 years surely
[1:20:10] it took all his ministry for this to
[1:20:12] unfold no we're talking about the
[1:20:14] sounding of this
[1:20:16] message the prophetic
[1:20:19] part not the Evangelistic part
[1:20:27] you say it can't be I say is anything
[1:20:32] too hard for the Lord
[1:20:36] am in the message the first seal
[1:20:41] 1963 paragraph
[1:20:44] 195 he says now then reformers know that
[1:20:47] there was something wrong Luther knowed
[1:20:50] that that that bread wasn't the body of
[1:20:52] of Christ so he preached the just shall
[1:20:55] live by faith we must still preach the
[1:20:58] just shall live by faith and that was
[1:21:01] his message and when John le Wesley came
[1:21:03] along he saw that there was
[1:21:05] sanctification so he preached
[1:21:08] sanctification we must still preach
[1:21:10] sanctification and Holiness and hold up
[1:21:14] hold it up high before the people this
[1:21:17] is your
[1:21:18] goal not fornication not adulter
[1:21:21] sanctification
[1:21:26] Holiness so he preached sanctification
[1:21:29] that was his message
[1:21:30] see the Pentecostals brought in the
[1:21:33] message of the Holy Ghost and so forth
[1:21:36] and we still preach the baptism of the
[1:21:38] Holy Ghost but in these last days and
[1:21:41] this last age the messenger is not to
[1:21:44] start any
[1:21:45] Reformation but is to take all the
[1:21:47] Mysteries that these reformers left off
[1:21:50] gather them together solve them to the
[1:21:52] the people let me just read it again it
[1:21:55] sounds so good to me I saw another
[1:21:57] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:21:59] clothed with a cloud a rainbow upon his
[1:22:02] head and his face the Sun and his feet
[1:22:04] as pillars of fire now we saw the same
[1:22:07] thing which was
[1:22:08] Christ and we know Christ is always the
[1:22:13] messenger where did we see the same
[1:22:16] thing on Sunset
[1:22:18] Mountain we saw the same thing we saw
[1:22:21] the pattern of his word on
[1:22:23] folding we know Christ is always the
[1:22:26] messenger of the
[1:22:27] church all right he's called the pillar
[1:22:30] of fire the angel of the Covenant and so
[1:22:31] forth and he had in his hand a little
[1:22:34] book open now the seals had done been
[1:22:37] broke
[1:22:38] here where he's reading from the
[1:22:41] scriptures then he
[1:22:43] says
[1:22:44] 1963 March 18th preaching on the first
[1:22:48] seal he says now the seals had been
[1:22:51] broke here in the
[1:22:53] prophecy then he says we're breaking
[1:22:56] them
[1:22:57] now this thing is
[1:23:04] open Revelations 10 and
[1:23:09] verse3 and cried with a loud voice as
[1:23:12] when a lion roared and when he had cried
[1:23:16] seven Thunders uttered their
[1:23:19] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[1:23:21] uttered their voices
[1:23:23] I was about to write and I Heard a Voice
[1:23:25] from Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:23:28] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[1:23:30] and write them
[1:23:34] not you see brother Daniel it's not even
[1:23:38] written how can we even attempt to know
[1:23:42] what it could
[1:23:43] be it's not written so let's just close
[1:23:48] that
[1:23:49] page though it wasn't a r written
[1:23:54] word it has never ceased to be the
[1:23:57] spoken
[1:23:58] word was it a spoken word seven Thunders
[1:24:02] uttered their voices spoken
[1:24:05] word God told John don't write
[1:24:08] it but he won't draw back what he has
[1:24:11] said and his word will never return void
[1:24:14] to
[1:24:17] him God said in the
[1:24:21] beginning say the Earth was void without
[1:24:25] form Darkness was upon the face of the
[1:24:27] deep and God said let there be
[1:24:31] light and there was
[1:24:33] light the spoken word did
[1:24:37] that you said yeah brother I I I've read
[1:24:40] it that's Genesis verse 1 and
[1:24:42] two but you understand that that wasn't
[1:24:46] written until 2500 years later when
[1:24:50] Moses was given the vision
[1:24:54] did the lack of it being written hinder
[1:24:57] God's word from coming to pass no sir he
[1:25:00] spoke it it was time it was season it
[1:25:03] happened God then 25 200 years later God
[1:25:06] said go ahead Moses write it for a
[1:25:09] history to the church to my people so
[1:25:13] when they read it they can learn to see
[1:25:15] there's a pattern in my word what kind
[1:25:18] of pattern a pattern like Jesus Christ
[1:25:22] is the same yesterday today and
[1:25:28] forever in the me in the first
[1:25:32] seal Prophet said this paragraph
[1:25:35] 263 he says we found what the thunder
[1:25:39] means that's perfectly we know that
[1:25:43] see then what did he
[1:25:46] say why just he told you we found what
[1:25:50] the Thunder is we know what what it
[1:25:54] is someone tell me what is
[1:25:58] it no let me share
[1:26:01] it we found what the thunder means the
[1:26:04] prophet said that's perfectly we know
[1:26:07] that see the Thunder was the voice of
[1:26:09] God when the seal
[1:26:14] opened the Thunder a
[1:26:18] symbol like the
[1:26:19] seal a symbol
[1:26:22] the Thunder was the voice of God when a
[1:26:26] seal is opened so what would seven
[1:26:29] Thunders
[1:26:30] be the opening of Seven
[1:26:35] Seals in the message in questions and
[1:26:38] answers number four
[1:26:42] 1964 they asked him a question number
[1:26:46] 395 have the seven Thunders which equal
[1:26:48] seven Mysteries already been revealed
[1:26:53] it's 1964 now were they revealed in the
[1:26:56] Seven Seals but are not yet known to us
[1:26:59] as the Thunders
[1:27:02] yet no he says they were revealed in the
[1:27:05] Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was
[1:27:08] about they was to reveal the seven
[1:27:11] Thunders that uttered their voices and
[1:27:12] no one could make out what it was John
[1:27:15] knew what it was but he was forbidden to
[1:27:17] write it he said but the seventh angel
[1:27:19] in the days of his sounding the seven
[1:27:21] Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be
[1:27:23] revealed can the seventh angel is a
[1:27:25] messenger of the seven Church age
[1:27:30] See Seven Seals that's what seven
[1:27:33] Thunders was all about because a thunder
[1:27:38] is the voice of God when a seal opened
[1:27:42] now think in your
[1:27:46] minds historically to
[1:27:50] 1963 and God sends a Prophet back to
[1:27:52] Jeffersonville
[1:27:55] Indiana and he says I went I'd go I'd be
[1:27:58] in that little room where I was studying
[1:28:00] he says and the angel would come down
[1:28:04] and he'd say pick up your pen and
[1:28:07] write what was that angel telling
[1:28:12] him he was telling him what he forbade
[1:28:16] John to
[1:28:20] write but John Couldn't Write
[1:28:23] was being told to that prophet in
[1:28:26] 1963 seven times seven Thunders
[1:28:30] Hallelujah because a thunder is the
[1:28:33] voice of God when a seal was
[1:28:50] open Seven Seals
[1:28:55] the bride
[1:28:56] age Seven Seals it is the bride age the
[1:29:01] Revelation Seven Seals it's say coming
[1:29:03] to the bride Seven Seals it's a sounding
[1:29:06] of the seventh angel Seven Seals it's
[1:29:08] his third pole Ministry Seven Seals it's
[1:29:11] the revealing of the word Seven Seals
[1:29:14] it's heart turning time not information
[1:29:18] not education Revelation a personal
[1:29:21] experience with the father made possible
[1:29:23] through the blood of Jesus
[1:29:30] Christ did you know seven
[1:29:33] Thunders is what will turn the hearts of
[1:29:35] the children to the
[1:29:37] fathers listen to this an exposition in
[1:29:41] in the message the exposition of the
[1:29:42] seven Church ages he says now this
[1:29:45] messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations
[1:29:50] 10:7 is going going to do two
[1:29:54] things one according to Malachi 4 he'll
[1:29:58] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:30:00] fathers two he'll reveal the mysteries
[1:30:03] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[1:30:07] which are the revelations contained in
[1:30:09] the Seven Seals it will be these
[1:30:11] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:30:14] literally will turn the hearts of the
[1:30:16] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:30:20] exactly so but consider this also this
[1:30:24] Prophet Messenger will be in his nature
[1:30:26] and his manners as Elijah and John the
[1:30:29] people of this Prophet messenger's day
[1:30:31] will be as they were in ahab's day and
[1:30:33] in John's and says it's only the
[1:30:37] children and since it's only the
[1:30:40] children whose Hearts will be turned
[1:30:43] it's only the children who will
[1:30:46] listen in the days of Ahab only 7,000
[1:30:49] true seed is Israelites were found in
[1:30:52] the days of John there were also very
[1:30:54] few the masses in both Ages were in the
[1:30:58] fornication of idolatry even as we see
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:06] today you just lost a lot of friends
[1:31:08] brother the Daniel well I know I pray
[1:31:11] for
[1:31:15] him listen to this the message standing
[1:31:18] the Gap
[1:31:20] 1963
[1:31:23] well it happens to be that at least one
[1:31:25] man is present this
[1:31:27] morning who was standing there when it
[1:31:29] happened speaking on Sunset Mountain it
[1:31:32] actually shook the Rocks off the
[1:31:34] mountain we find out that during that
[1:31:37] time I saw seven angels in the form of a
[1:31:40] pyramid swept down and picked me up and
[1:31:44] I was brought East to open the Seven
[1:31:46] Seals for
[1:31:48] God what part of any of those statements
[1:31:50] failed what part of any of those
[1:31:53] statements did God not keep what part
[1:31:55] was he unable to
[1:31:57] keep he kept it
[1:32:00] all and I was brought East to open the
[1:32:03] Seven Seals for God and if you haven't
[1:32:05] got them if Jesus terries my great
[1:32:09] grandchildren little Paul's children
[1:32:10] there will still be he said that will
[1:32:13] still be the Eternal truth of the Living
[1:32:15] God now that was to find out what was
[1:32:19] sealed inside this mountain he's talking
[1:32:21] of the vision now that wasn't wrot it
[1:32:24] had to be interpreted and when I come
[1:32:27] back and when I came back the first
[1:32:30] angel on the first night opened the seal
[1:32:33] contrary to anything we ever heard in
[1:32:36] our
[1:32:38] life you remember when he preached the
[1:32:40] first seal he said if it hadn't have
[1:32:42] been about noon today when the angel
[1:32:46] came down I would have got it all
[1:32:49] wrong I would have said it all wrong
[1:32:52] none of it would have been right but he
[1:32:54] came
[1:32:57] down am said and when I come back the
[1:33:02] first angel on the first night open the
[1:33:04] seal contrary to anything we've ever
[1:33:06] heard in our life and all same and all
[1:33:09] seven came out the same way you know
[1:33:11] that you were here present when it
[1:33:14] happened many of
[1:33:18] you and the message is this the sign
[1:33:22] of the
[1:33:23] answer paragraph
[1:33:25] 3:14 Prophet says this now when he
[1:33:30] begins to sound he's quoting Revelations
[1:33:33] 10:7 now huh now when he begins to sound
[1:33:37] the mystery will be finished now
[1:33:39] note then it's time for the seven seal
[1:33:42] voices of Revelations 10 to be revealed
[1:33:45] now he's connecting Revelations 10:7
[1:33:48] with Revelations 10:4 and the Seven
[1:33:50] Thunders one one and the
[1:33:53] same now when he begins to sound the
[1:33:55] mystery will be finished now note then
[1:33:57] it's time for the seven seal voices of
[1:34:00] Revelations 10 to be revealed do you
[1:34:02] understand congregation says amen but
[1:34:06] they didn't
[1:34:08] understand wasn't the season it wasn't
[1:34:11] their time but it is your time and this
[1:34:14] is the season amen
[1:34:17] hallelujah you say you don't understand
[1:34:20] brother Daniel I'm I'm not
[1:34:22] educated neither was William
[1:34:26] brandham neither was John the
[1:34:29] Baptist I don't think Jesus went one day
[1:34:32] of school in his
[1:34:34] life it's not
[1:34:36] education it's
[1:34:38] Revelation education actually hinders us
[1:34:43] education actually robs
[1:34:48] us now you go ahead and get your
[1:34:50] education
[1:34:53] but if you don't balance it with the
[1:34:55] word the education will get
[1:35:00] you so Revelations 10 what is it a
[1:35:04] prophet told us Revelations 10 it's the
[1:35:07] seventh seal Revelations 10 what is it
[1:35:11] Revelations 10 it's the bride age
[1:35:14] Revelations 10 what is it he told us
[1:35:17] it's his coming not the first it's the
[1:35:19] second Revelations 10 it's when the
[1:35:22] Seven Seals were opened there on the
[1:35:24] mountain February the 28th
[1:35:29] 1963 so
[1:35:32] now you can write Revelations
[1:35:36] 101 and then put February the 28th
[1:35:41] 1963 this day this scripture fulfilled
[1:35:47] Hallelujah who else can do that but the
[1:35:50] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:35:51] and to whom the lamb will give
[1:35:54] Revelation oh the book is a living
[1:36:00] book Revelations 10 it's when the
[1:36:04] seventh angel begins to sound March the
[1:36:07] 18th
[1:36:09] 1963 now you can write Revelations
[1:36:14] 10:7 March 18th
[1:36:20] 1963
[1:36:21] put it that date down like the day you
[1:36:24] gave your heart to Jesus
[1:36:27] Christ October the 8th
[1:36:33] 1974 I was tired of
[1:36:36] running I left home at
[1:36:39] 16 I thought I'd return back to
[1:36:41] California Los Angeles
[1:36:46] Bakersville I thought I could run away
[1:36:49] from
[1:36:50] God
[1:36:52] took me many steps to get
[1:36:54] there but God took one and he was there
[1:36:58] right at my
[1:37:03] side Revelations 10
[1:37:06] verse5 and the angel which I saw stand
[1:37:09] upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted
[1:37:12] up his hand to heaven and swear by him
[1:37:15] that liveth forever and ever who created
[1:37:18] heaven and the things that therein are
[1:37:20] and the Earth and the things that there
[1:37:22] are and the Sea the things which are
[1:37:25] therein that there should be time no
[1:37:28] longer and the question came
[1:37:31] up did Time
[1:37:33] [Music]
[1:37:37] end when the seals was
[1:37:50] preached
[1:37:51] questions and answers number three
[1:37:55] 1964 they asked him a question now if
[1:37:59] time
[1:38:00] ceases when the seals were
[1:38:02] open he said excuse me if time ceased
[1:38:06] when the seals were open then the
[1:38:08] Millennium also then the Millennium is
[1:38:10] also finished is it not Prophet said no
[1:38:13] no no time didn't cease when the seals
[1:38:16] were open misunderstood it what happened
[1:38:20] is the Myer was revealed not time ceased
[1:38:23] see just look watch real close now and
[1:38:27] and we play your tape if you got it from
[1:38:29] a tape
[1:38:31] see they always get it from the tape
[1:38:34] they even get it wrong when they get it
[1:38:36] from the tape because it it requires
[1:38:38] Revelation requires sincerity requires a
[1:38:42] humble
[1:38:43] heart not what I know but what I want to
[1:38:46] know Lord
[1:38:48] Jesus time never ceased this must be a
[1:38:52] post millennial or something that ask
[1:38:53] the question because you see we got a
[1:38:56] thousand years after the church has gone
[1:38:58] home and comes back upon the Earth then
[1:39:00] time ceases and the new heavens and new
[1:39:02] earth now the Millennium is not the new
[1:39:03] heavens and new earth there will still
[1:39:06] be sin after the Millennium the
[1:39:08] Millennium is a type of Noah going in
[1:39:10] the ark and carried over and brought ham
[1:39:13] and them under the side and sin even
[1:39:15] came out of the Ark
[1:39:17] see
[1:39:20] see Hallelujah Revelations
[1:39:24] 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the
[1:39:27] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:39:30] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:39:33] finished as he had declared to servants
[1:39:36] the
[1:39:38] prophets Revelations 10 is when the
[1:39:41] seventh angel begins to sound his
[1:39:43] message not the healing service the
[1:39:46] message that followed the healing
[1:39:50] service
[1:39:52] you say are you sure you got a quote for
[1:39:53] that brother Daniel I'm glad you asked I
[1:39:56] do in the message I have heard but now I
[1:40:00] see
[1:40:01] 1965 he said now we're promised that
[1:40:03] church age through reformers and we've
[1:40:05] had them but he promised in Malachi 4
[1:40:08] he'd keep his pattern in the last days
[1:40:11] of what would took place the word of God
[1:40:14] is full of
[1:40:16] patterns by which we can gain Revelation
[1:40:20] and know the truth truth he said he'd
[1:40:22] keep his pattern in the last days what
[1:40:24] would take place to turn the hearts of
[1:40:26] the children back to the faith of the
[1:40:28] apostolic fathers for that very purpose
[1:40:31] and the church is so broke up in
[1:40:32] denominations and isms it so tore to
[1:40:36] Pieces till it's dead sounds like 2023
[1:40:40] doesn't it it's been a carrier and then
[1:40:43] he promised in the hour of the seventh
[1:40:45] Angels message the Seven Seals would be
[1:40:47] revealed and the mysteries of God would
[1:40:49] be declared revelation 10 he says when
[1:40:52] the seventh angel begins to sound his
[1:40:54] message not the healing service the
[1:40:57] message that followed the healing
[1:41:02] service
[1:41:05] 1963 the message that following in the
[1:41:08] Rapture 1965 paragraph 108 now there's a
[1:41:12] messenger above always and a messenger
[1:41:15] on Earth the English word angel means a
[1:41:18] messenger and the seventh angels message
[1:41:21] while he was making his proclaiming his
[1:41:22] ministry then when he began to sound
[1:41:25] forth his ministry not when he started
[1:41:28] Jesus when he started out now he's
[1:41:30] taking us to the pattern of the word
[1:41:33] again not just telling us this is how I
[1:41:36] did it no he's also saying now watch
[1:41:39] when Jesus started out because the
[1:41:42] pattern of the second coming is the
[1:41:44] pattern of the
[1:41:45] first Jesus when he started out he
[1:41:48] started Healing The
[1:41:49] Sick and afflict him oh that great Rabbi
[1:41:53] he's a prophet everybody wanted him in
[1:41:55] his church but when he set one down down
[1:41:58] when he sat down one day and said I and
[1:42:01] my father are one that was different and
[1:42:05] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:42:07] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:42:10] in you except you eat the Flesh of the
[1:42:15] son of man of course we understand it
[1:42:18] was a
[1:42:19] parable
[1:42:21] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:42:23] man so the flesh represented something
[1:42:26] not flesh can drink his blood and the
[1:42:29] blood represented something not blood
[1:42:32] you have no life in
[1:42:35] you so Seven
[1:42:37] Seals were
[1:42:39] preached March the
[1:42:41] 17th
[1:42:43] 1963 beginning with God in Simplicity it
[1:42:47] was 10 services in 8 days and on March
[1:42:51] 24th
[1:42:53] 1963 he preaches the seven
[1:42:56] seal keep in
[1:42:58] mind that what he
[1:43:00] said in these eight
[1:43:03] Services was this
[1:43:07] much about those Seven
[1:43:11] Seals but what he
[1:43:15] said from the time he preached them in '
[1:43:18] 63 to when God took him in
[1:43:21] 65 the Revelation grew like
[1:43:24] this that's right because it was the
[1:43:27] third poll Ministry that had begun there
[1:43:31] and continued to
[1:43:36] unfold so from Revelations
[1:43:39] 101 to Revelations
[1:43:43] 10:7 we see now it was
[1:43:46] fulfilled in 25
[1:43:49] days what has been begun is the ministry
[1:43:52] of the sounding of the seventh angel the
[1:43:55] third pole Ministry continues to
[1:43:58] 1965 the revealing of the word until God
[1:44:01] takes his prophet in an automobile
[1:44:04] accident December the 24th
[1:44:07] 1965 and the message of the seventh
[1:44:10] angel is
[1:44:15] completed and then we're challenged and
[1:44:17] said oh no no it ain't because I don't
[1:44:20] know understand this and I don't
[1:44:22] understand this and I don't understand
[1:44:23] this and I don't understand
[1:44:27] this and the reason many don't
[1:44:29] understand it because they're busy
[1:44:31] getting a education Okay the reason they
[1:44:34] don't understand it because they're
[1:44:35] watching too many YouTube videos okay
[1:44:38] and the reason they don't understand it
[1:44:40] is because they're playing too many
[1:44:41] games and the re
[1:44:49] huh
[1:44:52] the year's
[1:44:54] 1962 the message is is this the sign of
[1:44:57] the answer in paragraph
[1:45:01] 297 he said the book that is written
[1:45:04] within is then completed is then
[1:45:07] completed when this Angel
[1:45:12] ceases he says I'm giving you a
[1:45:16] sign and when you watch when this Angel
[1:45:19] ceases when he passes away you know what
[1:45:23] that
[1:45:24] means God was successful again amen God
[1:45:28] kept his word promise made promise kept
[1:45:32] God kept his word
[1:45:35] amen when the seventh angels He says the
[1:45:38] book that is written
[1:45:40] within is then completed when this Angel
[1:45:43] ceases he says now please understand
[1:45:46] this he said when the seventh Angel's
[1:45:49] message is completed
[1:45:51] the godhead Ministry mystery the serpent
[1:45:54] seed mystery all the other mysteries of
[1:45:56] all these
[1:45:59] things we have these divinely revealed
[1:46:04] mystery
[1:46:05] truths to share with one another in
[1:46:09] God's
[1:46:10] people if we'll get into the
[1:46:17] word in the message influence 196
[1:46:21] 63 it's November the
[1:46:25] 30th Prophet says what did John the
[1:46:29] Baptist
[1:46:30] do the man that Jesus said there was
[1:46:33] never a man born of a woman like him or
[1:46:36] could compare with him until that time
[1:46:38] the great prophet ordained of God before
[1:46:40] the foundation of the world spoke of
[1:46:44] 127 years before he ever come on or 712
[1:46:48] years rather before he ever came on the
[1:46:49] Earth by the prophet
[1:46:52] Isaiah what did he do when he seen a man
[1:46:55] come walking down out of the audience
[1:46:57] and he looked up above and saw that fire
[1:46:59] coming down from heaven in the form of a
[1:47:01] dove he cried he cried out I have
[1:47:04] need to be baptized Of
[1:47:09] Thee I must
[1:47:12] decrease then a prophet says I must
[1:47:15] decrease he must increase God can't have
[1:47:18] two on the earth at the same
[1:47:21] time you know there's not two on the
[1:47:23] earth
[1:47:25] now so there must be something prophetic
[1:47:30] happening something that we're seeing or
[1:47:32] maybe something we're not seeing
[1:47:34] something that we should
[1:47:37] see God can't have two under Earth at
[1:47:39] the same time only one has the message
[1:47:42] you know I must
[1:47:45] decrease he
[1:47:47] says he is the
[1:47:49] messenger it's the end of
[1:47:53] 1963 and a prophet of God says I must
[1:47:57] decrease then he says he's the messenger
[1:48:01] no no no wa brother Bram you're the
[1:48:02] messenger you're the one you're the
[1:48:04] messenger he says I must decrease he's
[1:48:08] the messenger I've been up to this
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:12] time 1963 the end of the year now he
[1:48:17] takes my
[1:48:19] place
[1:48:20] as Elisha when Elijah went up and throw
[1:48:23] back his robe to Elisha his ministry was
[1:48:26] finished Elisha must take up who he left
[1:48:29] off he must increase I must
[1:48:33] decrease says like John the Baptist he
[1:48:36] says now revealing something that he is
[1:48:40] experiencing he's now he's revealing
[1:48:42] something but in Simplicity paragraph
[1:48:46] 111 he says be conscious of your little
[1:48:52] you know why cuz he was feeling very
[1:48:55] conscious of his
[1:48:58] littleness he prayed for the
[1:49:02] sick crippled walk blind
[1:49:06] saw the dead were
[1:49:10] raised my parents had a good friend her
[1:49:14] name was
[1:49:17] Rosie they were living in California at
[1:49:19] the time in Los
[1:49:21] Angeles she was diagnosed with terminal
[1:49:24] cancer they said just go home and die
[1:49:28] the growth had already on her neck
[1:49:30] become protruding nothing we can do for
[1:49:34] you but that
[1:49:36] night she got a prayer
[1:49:48] guard she went in the line
[1:49:51] Prophet took her by the
[1:49:54] hand so the doctors have told you this
[1:49:57] and this you can't live it's terminal
[1:50:02] that's what that growth on your neck
[1:50:05] is a parents had he prayed for
[1:50:08] her and the growth fell
[1:50:13] off and she
[1:50:17] live but listen to this
[1:50:21] she didn't go on in her latter years
[1:50:24] serving the
[1:50:30] [Music]
[1:50:34] lord where are the multitudes that were
[1:50:37] healed in the prayer
[1:50:39] lines most are all
[1:50:41] dead
[1:50:44] except those to whom Jesus Christ became
[1:50:48] real except those those who were born
[1:50:51] again except those who got the baptism
[1:50:54] of the Holy Ghost they're not dead
[1:50:56] they're sleeping in
[1:50:59] Christ it's not the healing of the body
[1:51:02] but it's the healing of that
[1:51:05] Soul it's the quickening power within
[1:51:10] you after the Forerunner has left the
[1:51:13] scene who is the
[1:51:15] messenger follow the pattern the Holy
[1:51:19] Spirit Christ in his bride as he was in
[1:51:23] his
[1:51:25] prophet and what follows a ministerial
[1:51:29] change from a one- man Ministry to the
[1:51:32] ministry of a many membered body that's
[1:51:35] the
[1:51:36] pattern that's the pattern that's
[1:51:42] right you remember the
[1:51:44] parable of the rich man and the poor
[1:51:47] beggar
[1:51:48] Lazarus Lazar Nazareth died a beggar on
[1:51:52] the
[1:51:53] streets the Bible says a host of angels
[1:51:56] came and took him to the bosom of
[1:51:59] Abraham to that Fifth
[1:52:02] Dimension because the Fifth Dimension
[1:52:04] was in two parts with a Chasm breached
[1:52:08] between the two one side was a waiting
[1:52:12] place for the
[1:52:14] righteous the other side is hell a place
[1:52:17] of Torment a prison house
[1:52:20] both awaiting Judgment
[1:52:23] Day when the rich man was in hell he
[1:52:27] lifted up his eyes he could see
[1:52:30] Lazarus blessed
[1:52:32] peaceful not hungry no more not dirty no
[1:52:35] more not torn clothing
[1:52:39] anymore he said Father Abraham let him
[1:52:43] dip with his finger just a little bit of
[1:52:44] water he says
[1:52:46] no there's a Chasm here we can't cross
[1:52:48] to your side you can't come to
[1:52:50] us he says I've got family I've got
[1:52:53] Brothers on the other
[1:52:56] side he says send Lazarus no Lazarus
[1:53:00] can't return raise up one of the
[1:53:02] prophets from the dead to go back and
[1:53:05] tell my brethren he says even if I was
[1:53:08] to raise a prophet and send him they
[1:53:11] would not believe him they have Moses in
[1:53:14] the law amen amen even if William brand
[1:53:19] raised again they would not believe they
[1:53:22] don't they're not believing him now and
[1:53:24] they claim to be reading and hearing the
[1:53:26] tapes every
[1:53:35] day
[1:53:38] no remember what he
[1:53:40] said I must
[1:53:43] decrease William brandham I must
[1:53:47] decrease he is the messenger
[1:53:50] I've been up to this
[1:53:54] time now he takes my
[1:53:57] place the words of a
[1:54:02] prophet it's November the 30th
[1:54:07] 1963 and he can feel the
[1:54:10] pull and he can see the fornication of
[1:54:14] ID of idolatry in the people
[1:54:18] already
[1:54:22] but what was to
[1:54:25] follow is not God bringing back a
[1:54:28] prophet whom Jesus in the parable said
[1:54:31] even if I was to raise one from the dead
[1:54:33] you would not believe
[1:54:36] him that Parable is there for a
[1:54:40] purpose that nugget is laying there for
[1:54:42] a
[1:54:44] reason Revelations 10 and8 and the voice
[1:54:48] which I heard from heaven Heaven spoke
[1:54:50] unto me again and said go and take the
[1:54:52] little book which is open in the hand of
[1:54:54] the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[1:54:57] and upon the Earth and I went unto the
[1:55:00] angel and said unto him give me the
[1:55:02] little book he said unto me take it and
[1:55:04] eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[1:55:08] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[1:55:11] sweet as
[1:55:13] honey let me read verse eight
[1:55:18] again Holy Spirit telling me read it
[1:55:22] again and the voice which I heard from
[1:55:24] Heaven John speaking
[1:55:26] here spake unto me again and said and go
[1:55:30] and take the little
[1:55:32] book from the hand of the seventh
[1:55:36] angel he didn't say that it doesn't say
[1:55:41] that let's read what it does say and the
[1:55:44] voice which I heard from Heaven spake
[1:55:46] unto me again said go and take the
[1:55:48] little book which is open in the hand of
[1:55:51] the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[1:55:55] and upon the
[1:55:57] Earth each and every one of
[1:56:00] you me
[1:56:02] included we need a personal experience
[1:56:06] with Jesus
[1:56:09] Christ the Lamb of
[1:56:13] God verse 9 and I went unto the angel
[1:56:16] said unto him give me the little book he
[1:56:18] said unto me take it
[1:56:20] eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[1:56:22] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[1:56:24] sweet as honey and I took the little
[1:56:26] book out of the Angel's hand it's an
[1:56:29] open book now and ate it up and it was
[1:56:33] in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon
[1:56:35] as I had eaten it my belly was
[1:56:38] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:56:42] prophesy
[1:56:43] again before many peoples Nations
[1:56:48] tongues and
[1:56:50] Kings the bride of Christ you and
[1:56:54] I we must
[1:56:57] prophesy of the hope that lays in our
[1:57:02] hearts of this Born Again
[1:57:06] experience Seven
[1:57:08] Seals it's seven
[1:57:11] parts of one Plan of Redemption for the
[1:57:14] bride
[1:57:15] tree and the fig
[1:57:18] tree listen to this Revelations 5 number
[1:57:23] two
[1:57:25] 1961 he said and this Sevenfold book
[1:57:30] of book of seven Redemptive plans has
[1:57:34] been brought to us and that's what this
[1:57:37] book holds now we're going to get over
[1:57:39] into the 10th chapter where this Mighty
[1:57:42] Angel proclaims
[1:57:44] something and he had a little book that
[1:57:46] John had to eat and when he did he got
[1:57:49] it into his belly it was bitter but in
[1:57:51] his lips it was sweet when you have to
[1:57:54] digest it it gets a bitter everybody's
[1:57:56] against you everybody's telling you're a
[1:57:57] Holy Roller you're this you're that see
[1:58:00] you're off your head so it's hard to
[1:58:02] digest it but when you're testifying of
[1:58:04] his glory it's sweeten your lips that's
[1:58:06] all see and when you stand up in a
[1:58:08] meeting you say glory to God hallelujah
[1:58:11] when you're going to the great Siege
[1:58:12] it's hard but when you're out of that
[1:58:14] great Siege you can testify it then it
[1:58:17] sweep in the lips
[1:58:20] that's right that's this book of
[1:58:26] redemption now I'm going to share with
[1:58:29] you how Revelation
[1:58:34] comes where it
[1:58:36] starts and how you can receive
[1:58:48] it
[1:58:51] who wants to
[1:58:56] know this is where it
[1:58:59] begins for each and every one of
[1:59:02] us acts
[1:59:05] 237 now when they heard this preaching
[1:59:09] of this Revelations 10 1-7 the Seven
[1:59:12] Seals they were pricked in their heart
[1:59:15] you say whoa brother Daniel they no they
[1:59:18] never heard in that
[1:59:21] day did you ever hear brother brandham
[1:59:24] say when he preached The Sixth Seal
[1:59:27] we're going to do something different
[1:59:28] now he says I want you open your
[1:59:33] Bible to Revelation
[1:59:36] 61 and turn and open to Matthew 24 and
[1:59:41] I'm going to show you how Jesus preached
[1:59:44] to them the Seven Seals in a parable
[1:59:48] that's right in a parable so now when
[1:59:51] they heard this they were pricked in
[1:59:52] their heart acts 237 said unto Peter and
[1:59:55] to the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:59:57] Brethren what shall we
[2:00:01] do they were pricked in their
[2:00:05] hearts because Peter had spoke to them
[2:00:09] he had spoke to them
[2:00:11] harshly right he seen in that multitude
[2:00:14] of people men who had stood that day
[2:00:18] before pontious Pilot's
[2:00:21] court and yelled with all the rest of
[2:00:23] the Jews who were there crucify
[2:00:27] him and now they're standing here at
[2:00:29] this day on the day of
[2:00:31] Pentecost hearing
[2:00:34] 120 speak in their native tongues and
[2:00:39] understanding every word they're
[2:00:41] saying and now they realize a great
[2:00:44] error they had done now they realize in
[2:00:47] their ignorance what they had done John
[2:00:49] crucified the Lord Of
[2:00:53] Glory and Peter says now therefore let
[2:00:57] all the house of Israel no assurity that
[2:01:00] God had made that same Jesus whom ye
[2:01:03] crucified he's talking to a large
[2:01:06] multitude of
[2:01:08] people and they saying do you understand
[2:01:11] now what you've done this Jesus whom
[2:01:15] whom you crucified is both Lord and
[2:01:18] Christ
[2:01:20] when they heard
[2:01:22] this knowing the things they had said
[2:01:25] about this
[2:01:27] message knowing the way they've been
[2:01:29] living
[2:01:30] lately when they heard this they were
[2:01:32] pricked in their heart and we should be
[2:01:36] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[2:01:37] the
[2:01:38] Apostles men and
[2:01:41] Brethren I'm guilty this morning of
[2:01:44] things I shouldn't be
[2:01:47] in but
[2:01:49] what shall I
[2:01:52] do I've been secretly doing stuff I
[2:01:55] shouldn't and the word is pricked my
[2:01:57] heart this
[2:02:01] morning hanging out with the wrong
[2:02:03] school
[2:02:04] friends being on the wrong
[2:02:10] sides speaking things you couldn't speak
[2:02:13] to feel more accepted and not
[2:02:17] rejected and they were pricked in their
[2:02:21] hearts he said men and
[2:02:24] Brethren what shall we
[2:02:26] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[2:02:31] be baptized every one of you in the name
[2:02:34] of Jesus
[2:02:36] Christ for the remission of these
[2:02:40] sins that perhaps even followed you
[2:02:43] through that door this
[2:02:46] morning and you shall
[2:02:49] receive the gift of the Holy
[2:02:56] Ghost that's taking a
[2:02:59] step
[2:03:03] forward to become part of the seven-part
[2:03:07] [Music]
[2:03:08] plan that's designed to restore you to
[2:03:13] justify you to sanctify you to fill you
[2:03:16] with the Holy
[2:03:17] Ghost and when you need it are
[2:03:22] refilling you see when I was in the
[2:03:24] Apostolic Church amongst the Pentecostal
[2:03:27] people you had to speak in tongues or
[2:03:31] you didn't have the Holy Ghost but then
[2:03:33] you spoke in
[2:03:36] tongues and you knew you weren't living
[2:03:39] right but you couldn't tell anyone to
[2:03:41] get some help because it was too
[2:03:43] shameful CU you'd already spoken tongues
[2:03:46] and supposedly you had it all then right
[2:03:48] that's all you needed you're good don't
[2:03:50] worry about
[2:03:52] it but we realize we weren't good and we
[2:03:56] were worried about
[2:04:01] it God rich in Mercy wants to baptize
[2:04:05] you with his Holy
[2:04:07] Ghost and if you get into a problem he
[2:04:11] wants to give you a refilling of that
[2:04:12] Holy Spirit you see because the
[2:04:15] refilling of the spirit in your life is
[2:04:18] not a re re wward for being a good guy
[2:04:20] or a good gal uh-uh
[2:04:25] no the refilling of the Holy Ghost is
[2:04:28] not a reward because all of a sudden you
[2:04:31] are so good this week no no no the
[2:04:35] refilling of the Holy
[2:04:38] Ghost is to give you the strength to
[2:04:42] overcome a hard
[2:04:46] trial feeling after refilling after
[2:04:51] refilling till th cup runneth
[2:04:54] over then it's rapturing time were quick
[2:04:57] and changed and
[2:04:59] translated by the power of His holy
[2:05:01] spirit this end time
[2:05:04] message this end time
[2:05:06] word this revelation of these Seven
[2:05:10] Seals is to take us unto
[2:05:13] Perfection that's the
[2:05:16] truth that's what the pro that's what
[2:05:19] Jesus preached when he preached on
[2:05:21] Perfection you know that
[2:05:24] right Matthew 5:48 I'm closing
[2:05:29] them I got a lot more to say but I'm
[2:05:32] closing
[2:05:33] them Matthew 5:48 Jesus said be ye
[2:05:37] therefore perfect even as your father
[2:05:40] which is in heaven is
[2:05:42] perfect talking to one of the associes
[2:05:46] pastors at a big mega church in the city
[2:05:49] we live congregations of five six 7,000
[2:05:53] people I was doing some work at his
[2:05:56] home and he said Dan you're a Believer I
[2:05:59] said I am indeed we get to talking on
[2:06:01] the word of
[2:06:03] God and I say and I read this scripture
[2:06:06] for him name was ber said Bert aren't
[2:06:09] you happy to know that God said we can
[2:06:12] be perfect because he said be ye
[2:06:14] therefore perfect even as your father
[2:06:17] which is in heaven is perfect he says oh
[2:06:19] Dan I sense a lot of Calvinism in you he
[2:06:22] says I said you do but I'm really 50%
[2:06:27] calvinist and 50% arenium I'm right in
[2:06:30] the middle I said he said we can't be
[2:06:33] perfect no such thing I said could it be
[2:06:36] we've
[2:06:39] misinterpreted the word in this Parable
[2:06:42] that Jesus spoke that it's symbolic of
[2:06:44] something and not a literal
[2:06:47] statement I said said let me leave you
[2:06:50] something to think on B and I'll leave
[2:06:52] you folks to something to think on be ye
[2:06:56] therefore perfect Matthew
[2:06:58] 5:48 even as your father which is in
[2:07:01] heaven is
[2:07:02] perfect do you know why he said be ye
[2:07:08] therefore because of the previous 47
[2:07:11] verses that he took the time to preach
[2:07:14] on
[2:07:16] Perfection and he told us the first step
[2:07:20] of how to
[2:07:22] arrive and I'll share the first step as
[2:07:24] a brother who'll take this place would
[2:07:26] come
[2:07:28] forward
[2:07:30] Jesus in Matthew 51 says and seeing the
[2:07:33] multitudes he went up into a mountain
[2:07:36] and when he was set his disciples came
[2:07:38] unto him and he opened his mouth and
[2:07:40] taught them saying blessed are the poorn
[2:07:44] spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[2:07:48] heaven
[2:07:50] you see that's where we all
[2:07:53] start blessed are the born
[2:07:57] Spirit born in
[2:07:59] sin shaped in iniquity come to this
[2:08:03] world speaking lies full of
[2:08:06] complexes maybe you're not maybe it's
[2:08:09] just
[2:08:10] me full of
[2:08:12] complexes poor in spirit like Sarah was
[2:08:17] Sarah was a woman poor in spirit but she
[2:08:20] loved
[2:08:22] God but the complexes of Life her maid
[2:08:26] making fun of her she couldn't have a
[2:08:29] child Sarah was a woman porn Spirit
[2:08:32] loved God believed God but Satan had
[2:08:35] beat her down to a
[2:08:37] place to convince her God can do
[2:08:42] anything but he's not going to do
[2:08:44] anything with you today or tomorrow no
[2:08:47] it's a
[2:08:49] why blessed are the porn
[2:08:52] spirits and this morning right
