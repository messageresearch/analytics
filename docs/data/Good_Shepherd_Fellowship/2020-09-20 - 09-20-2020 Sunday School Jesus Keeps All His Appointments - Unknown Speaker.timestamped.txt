[0:01] [Music]
[0:56] and just talk his
[0:56] side of religion and the pharisees
[0:59] laughed at jesus and made fun of him or
[1:01] something they did as they
[1:02] in that day and that he just thought it
[1:05] off that wasn't enough but it's an
[1:06] ordinary message he had to deliver he
[1:08] just
[1:08] sat there and he's in his presence and
[1:10] that was all it was to him it didn't
[1:11] mean nothing to him but if he'd been
[1:13] conscious that boy could rise up from
[1:16] the dead today
[1:18] and set in this meeting this week he'd
[1:20] have done something about it
[1:22] he'd have a testimony that would have
[1:23] shook us all
[1:27] but he wasn't conscious now in the scene
[1:30] here there's
[1:32] something wrong
[1:35] it is it isn't right as jesus watched
[1:39] that boy go away
[1:40] tired and weary but the whole setting
[1:43] there's something wrong
[1:45] them pharisees hated jesus
[1:48] why would they invite him for a guest of
[1:51] honor
[1:52] when they hated him
[1:55] that pharisee had a as the old gambler's
[1:58] expression he had us
[2:00] something of his sleeve he had a trick
[2:05] card in his sleeve because they hated
[2:08] jesus
[2:09] i believe jesus realized that right then
[2:13] see people must have things in common
[2:16] my mother she used to have an expression
[2:20] birds of a feather flock together you
[2:23] don't see
[2:24] you don't see buzzards and doves feeding
[2:26] together
[2:28] there there one's a scavenger and the
[2:30] dove couldn't eat the buzzard's food
[2:32] because
[2:32] he don't have any gall he couldn't
[2:36] digest it
[2:37] and you don't see believers and
[2:39] unbelievers together
[2:41] unless there's some kind of a purpose
[2:43] for
[2:44] there's something something wrong
[2:47] this guy i had a trick up his sleeve
[2:51] you want to play it on jesus how you
[2:54] take people
[2:55] like you take young people young teenage
[2:58] children they don't like to be around
[3:00] the old folks because
[3:01] they they have things in common the
[3:04] young married couples they have things
[3:06] in common
[3:07] the old people they don't want to be
[3:09] around the kids so much they
[3:10] they got things in common when you see a
[3:13] little girl
[3:14] hanging with grandma all the time now
[3:17] there's there's something wrong there's
[3:18] too much difference in their age
[3:20] she's either grandma's pet or grandma's
[3:22] got a sack of candy somewhere
[3:24] see there's there's a trick somewhere
[3:26] now i got a grandchild myself and i know
[3:30] there's a little trick somewhere seen
[3:32] and you see her hanging around grandma
[3:34] grandma's got a uh sack of candy or
[3:37] something
[3:38] so this fair she had something up his
[3:41] sleeve
[3:42] it all happened at a ministerial meeting
[3:45] where they
[3:46] gathered together and the subject was
[3:48] discussed about this fellow who called
[3:50] himself
[3:51] a prophet and they didn't believe he was
[3:55] a prophet
[3:57] because they couldn't see a man that
[3:58] wouldn't go along with them
[4:00] and all their doctrine that could be a
[4:02] prophet
[4:04] and so in this ministerial meeting they
[4:06] had decided that he wasn't a prophet and
[4:08] this old pharisee was going to prove it
[4:11] to him
[4:11] that he wasn't a prophet the pharisee
[4:15] was
[4:15] going to to make it sure
[4:18] and to show the congregation all the
[4:20] people in that city that he wasn't a
[4:22] prophet before he ever visit the city
[4:24] he'd never been in that city before so
[4:27] before he come
[4:28] he's going to expose him all that
[4:31] spirit it still lives
[4:34] going to expose it do something to
[4:36] hinder the meeting that he would have
[4:38] had there
[4:39] so we find out that he said i'll make a
[4:41] dinner and i'll invite everybody and get
[4:43] everybody in the city around
[4:45] and then we'll prove that he's not no
[4:47] prophet
[4:48] we'll prove it so pharisee might have
[4:52] thought that if he were doing this he
[4:53] would have
[4:54] he would have got a little uh maybe
[4:57] become after a while one of the
[4:58] presbyters or something he'd
[4:59] it really made a hit with his group
[5:02] he was going to make fun at the banquet
[5:05] of the lord jesus to prove that he
[5:07] wasn't a prophet
[5:08] do put him on the spot somewhere
[5:11] then he would be a big fella among them
[5:15] become some great man now we find out
[5:18] that the courier returns back and tells
[5:21] his master
[5:21] i found him he promised
[5:25] and he'll be here because i'll just tell
[5:27] the way he acted he'll be here
[5:29] all right now the pharisee waited for
[5:32] this certain time and they know when to
[5:34] make this banquet when everything was
[5:35] just right
[5:36] perhaps you will think in our little
[5:38] drama tonight that that he made it in a
[5:40] time when the grapes was ripe
[5:42] if he was ever in palestine when a great
[5:44] time or even in california
[5:46] when i'm great big clusters of grapes
[5:48] are just bleeding right
[5:49] the whole uh country
[5:53] the valley is just full of of that sweet
[5:55] smelling
[5:56] odor from those grapes he knows just
[5:58] when to make it right
[6:00] so he set that time on a certain day
[6:02] they would have
[6:03] this feast and finally the time come
[6:07] with when
[6:08] the feast was going to be carried on and
[6:09] he invited everybody
[6:11] to come that he could to come up all the
[6:13] celebrity and all the associations and
[6:15] so forth
[6:16] and all the clubs that was in the city
[6:19] that he belonged to
[6:20] it was all coming out to his great fine
[6:23] palace that set out high stood out
[6:26] as an estate there in the city and the
[6:30] time arrived for this to be
[6:32] done of course the yard was all taken
[6:34] care of and the tables were all
[6:36] set and the banquet room ready
[6:39] and then now he's going to have to take
[6:41] care of the
[6:43] his guests when they come any host will
[6:45] do that
[6:46] so he had to hire some stable boys
[6:49] because some of his hosts would become
[6:51] or some of his guests would be coming
[6:52] on uh chariots and some riding on mules
[6:56] some walking so anyone that makes a
[6:59] uh has a banquet has to make ready to
[7:02] entertain their guests
[7:05] so pharisee got everything just fixed up
[7:07] in all of his servants and got them
[7:09] ready
[7:10] got the stable boys where they could
[7:11] take the horses and all the fodder and
[7:13] stuff
[7:14] ready for them and then you had
[7:17] an innkeeper or door keeper that had to
[7:19] take up the
[7:20] invitations cause you you could not come
[7:23] unless she was invited
[7:24] and to take up the invitations he had
[7:26] their names down ever who was going to
[7:28] be there
[7:29] and they come they identified their name
[7:30] and so they could come in
[7:32] then let's just look what had what they
[7:35] had to do for a while
[7:36] i've been in the orens and maybe many of
[7:38] your hands and watch
[7:39] how they do it it's it's really striking
[7:42] and you notice then when everything's
[7:44] taken care of
[7:45] then when they come in the door the
[7:47] first thing the the keeper the door
[7:50] as to the r and they tell who they are
[7:53] he looks on his list and here's the name
[7:55] then he checks it
[7:56] then what he does he takes his staff
[7:58] sets it in the corner
[8:00] the boys takes the horses if he's
[8:02] walking or if he's on the horse and
[8:04] puts it in the stable now the next thing
[8:06] he does he enters into a hall
[8:10] and in here there's a bunch of a man
[8:12] what's called
[8:14] the feet washers
[8:17] the flunkies it's the lowest paid job
[8:20] there is
[8:21] is a foot wash flunky and to think of it
[8:24] we who think we're somebody and our lord
[8:27] identified himself on earth as a foot
[8:30] wash flunky
[8:32] that's exactly what he did and then we
[8:33] think we're somebody
[8:35] we'll run off here to school and get a
[8:37] little uh education
[8:39] and it and learn to say a few
[8:42] big words and come back and put on a
[8:45] suit of clothes and walk out here and
[8:47] want to be
[8:48] called doctor reverend or somebody
[8:53] i was up at a big museum not long ago
[8:55] and looking at some
[8:56] of the estimation of a man weighed a 150
[8:59] pound
[8:59] how much chemicals there was in his body
[9:02] you know how much there is when he's all
[9:03] rendered up is worth 84 cents
[9:07] then you'll put a 10 hat on it 84 cents
[9:09] and a 500
[9:10] mink coat and turn your nose up if irene
[9:12] it would drown you and then go along
[9:15] taking care of that 84 cents
[9:18] right thinking you're somebody and you
[9:21] don't give a
[9:22] care you act like it about that soul
[9:24] it's worth 10 million worlds
[9:30] the difference the rational how we can
[9:32] get
[9:34] now this foot wash flunky
[9:38] he had to wash their feet now in the
[9:40] when he traveled in palestine
[9:42] the palestinian garment is a robe it
[9:44] hangs low
[9:46] and then the underneath garment this
[9:47] comes to about the calf of the leg here
[9:50] or the underneath garment and as the the
[9:54] animals and the man travel the same
[9:57] trail
[9:58] the animals of course going along the
[10:00] trail and and
[10:02] and as as they travel the same trail and
[10:04] and the
[10:05] dust would come up from where the
[10:06] animals had been and it was a stink in
[10:08] the dust
[10:09] and it got on their feet when they were
[10:11] perspiring and their
[10:12] feet was shot with sandals
[10:16] and that would get all full of
[10:18] perspiration and
[10:20] and be wet sticky and then this
[10:23] stink from where the animals that
[10:24] crossed the trail
[10:26] would the palestinian garments sweeping
[10:28] like a skirt
[10:29] down low would pick up this dust and it
[10:31] would get beneath here and get all over
[10:33] their feet and over their
[10:34] their limbs and they really smell like
[10:38] that that trail
[10:39] where the animals have been so coming
[10:42] into a home like those pharisees had
[10:45] they're sent into persian got those
[10:46] great big fine
[10:48] rugs and and everything why you wouldn't
[10:50] feel
[10:51] welcome to come in before the host and
[10:54] uh and and then be all stinky like that
[10:58] so they had a way of taking care of that
[10:59] they had a a foot wash flunky
[11:02] and he stayed there and as soon as you
[11:04] come in and your
[11:05] name was registered the boy's taking the
[11:07] horses or your animals
[11:09] and taking them back to feed them one
[11:11] group of boys
[11:12] and then the doorkeeper recognized you
[11:15] by the chart that he had in his hand
[11:17] and then you're ready for the foot wash
[11:19] flunky
[11:20] then you go in you set your foot up he
[11:22] pulls off the sandal
[11:23] sets it up to a place so he'll know
[11:25] where you're at and on this other side
[11:27] he has a little shoe and actually gets
[11:30] to washing your feet washing it all off
[11:32] real good all the dust and everything
[11:34] make you fresh
[11:36] then he puts on this little cloth uh
[11:39] a shoe that goes over like you see in
[11:41] airplanes and crossing over
[11:43] overseas now they give them to you at
[11:45] night when you like uh the women have
[11:47] those little
[11:48] things they wear when they're not
[11:49] wearing stockings i see my wife and
[11:52] daughter and them getting some time they
[11:53] it's a little i i i don't know what they
[11:55] call them
[11:56] but it's just like a bottom part of a
[11:58] sock you know and you
[11:59] put it on your foot there's something on
[12:01] that order on this little higher
[12:03] because you don't want to take your old
[12:04] dirty sandal and walk
[12:06] over them rugs in there so then your
[12:09] feet's washed
[12:10] then you've got the next thing takes
[12:12] place you got this little
[12:13] booty on i'll call it and then the next
[12:16] thing takes place there's a man standing
[12:18] there with a towel
[12:19] over his shoulder and he's got some
[12:22] ointment in his hands and that's a
[12:24] perfumed
[12:25] oil now the direct rays of that
[12:29] palestinian sun
[12:30] upon your neck is just blistering and
[12:33] another thing that dust that picks up
[12:36] sometimes get into their beard and in
[12:38] their hair
[12:39] and this man stands here then with
[12:41] ointment and he holds it out in this
[12:43] little pan you get on your hands and
[12:45] rub it in your face and over your neck
[12:48] then you take this towel and
[12:49] wipe it off groom your hair now
[12:52] sometimes this is
[12:53] very rare because it really gives a
[12:56] a wonderful odor they get it many times
[12:59] from way high in the mountains
[13:01] on a wild rose bush you've seen a rules
[13:04] at the pedal drops off and it
[13:06] it gets a little a little apple-like on
[13:08] it and out of there they crush it
[13:10] and get this perfume it's said that the
[13:12] queen of sheba
[13:14] when she come to solomon brought much of
[13:16] this fine
[13:17] perfume of that and give it to solomon
[13:19] very rare
[13:20] so hard to get into the mountains and
[13:22] then when they
[13:23] wipe this their beard and cross their
[13:25] necks and with this towel
[13:27] groom themselves now they're ready to to
[13:30] meet the host to meet the one that
[13:32] invited them
[13:33] see they wouldn't feel right to go into
[13:35] all that dirt that's why
[13:37] feet washing see they they were smelling
[13:39] bad
[13:40] and they had to have their feet washed
[13:42] and with their big old heavy sandals on
[13:44] them fine
[13:45] rugs they wouldn't feel right they'd
[13:47] feel embarrassed but now
[13:48] his feet's washed now he's all groomed
[13:52] he smells with the perfume that's on him
[13:54] from this ointment what they call
[13:56] anointing their heads with oil
[13:59] and rubbing it on their face then wiping
[14:01] it with a towel
[14:02] now he's freshed up now the next thing
[14:04] he does
[14:05] he meets his horse the one that invited
[14:07] him he feels like meeting him now he
[14:09] wouldn't feel like meeting with all that
[14:11] dirt on him
[14:12] so he's all groomed up and ready now
[14:14] then the host meets him at the door
[14:16] and they have a very odd way and
[14:20] it's still in some of the churches a
[14:23] greeting
[14:23] with a kiss so they take a hand
[14:26] cross this way embrace one another
[14:30] man uh with with their arms around each
[14:33] other like this
[14:34] and kiss each other on the neck and when
[14:36] the host
[14:37] kisses you you are welcome
[14:41] that's the welcome kiss now you wouldn't
[14:43] want your horse to kiss you
[14:44] with all that old dirt and stuff on on
[14:47] you so you had to be cleaned up before
[14:50] you're kissed welcome but oh one once
[14:53] you're kissed welcome you are a
[14:55] full-fledged brother
[14:56] that's all you could today the only
[14:59] thing you can do like today you go in
[15:01] the house and
[15:02] you feel at home you're one of them he's
[15:04] kissed you
[15:05] welcome you remember judas kissing jesus
[15:08] hypocritically
[15:09] see because if he kissed him it was a
[15:12] welcome
[15:12] it was a friend kiss not in the lips but
[15:16] on the neck
[15:17] kiss them on the neck now we notice
[15:20] saying
[15:21] that you could go in if you want to go
[15:23] to the refrigerator it would be today
[15:25] and get you a great big sandwich and lay
[15:26] across the bed and eat it just make
[15:27] yourself at home
[15:29] you're welcome come in that's your all
[15:31] right now you just feel one of the
[15:33] family now because
[15:34] you're on the inside now you get all
[15:38] this done and anointed
[15:40] and uh all fixed up you're kissed
[15:42] welcome and then
[15:43] you go in shake hands at the banquet you
[15:45] meet your friends
[15:46] the host of done kissed you in and so
[15:48] you're you're free now
[15:49] you just feel like you're one of them
[15:51] you've been invited you've been clean
[15:54] you've been kissed welcome and now
[15:55] you're what i'm going to have your
[15:57] fellowship
[15:58] now about this time i'd imagine
[16:01] that rose lamb out there and the
[16:03] barbecue pit in the back was just
[16:05] smelling all around over the country
[16:07] with them grapes and things you'd
[16:08] imagine the poor people
[16:10] standing around the fence their mouth
[16:12] water they wasn't invited in
[16:14] just the celebrity to this so the the
[16:17] feast was now getting in
[16:18] pretty good sway everything is getting
[16:21] along
[16:22] fine for good sweet
[16:26] now i'd imagine pharisee and his
[16:29] all of his friends is tipping the glass
[16:32] one to another and taking a good
[16:33] healthy drink are the very best wines
[16:36] there was in
[16:37] palestine at the time because they were
[16:39] rich
[16:40] they could afford it and they everybody
[16:43] the women they're fine
[16:44] jeweled women was over in a corner
[16:46] having their fellowship
[16:48] sitting around on the vans and so forth
[16:50] as a custom was in that day and the man
[16:52] all up
[16:53] having their toast and talking and the
[16:55] priests and all the rabbis and
[16:56] everything having a great time
[16:59] and the feast is getting pretty well
[17:03] on the way and then jesus
[17:08] although busy as he was in his busy
[17:11] schedule
[17:12] he always keeps his appointment
[17:15] you can depend on that
[17:18] he keeps his appointment
[17:22] now let's look into the room
[17:26] and see what's going on i can see
[17:29] pharisee over there
[17:30] tipping his glass and saying rabbi you
[17:33] know what
[17:34] and the great conversation going on the
[17:36] businessman talking of their business
[17:37] and everything
[17:38] the banking banquet's in full swing now
[17:41] this great feast
[17:43] but look setting over against the wall
[17:47] not being noticed because jesus
[17:52] he kept his appointment he come he
[17:55] always keeps his word
[17:56] all his promises he fulfills
[18:01] but notice he he's sitting over there
[18:04] dirty i hate to say that it kills me to
[18:07] see it
[18:09] but his feet was dirty he hadn't been
[18:12] anointed
[18:14] he hadn't been kissed welcome though he
[18:17] was invited
[18:18] that's like some of our modern revivals
[18:26] the frenchman calls him jesus
[18:29] jesus with dirty feet could you imagine
[18:33] it
[18:37] he was invited and he come
[18:40] and there he is it got in some way
[18:43] and unnoticed he sets over as a wall
[18:46] flower he was just as
[18:49] much out of place there he is in some of
[18:51] our modern revivals
[18:55] banquets so-called religious gatherings
[18:59] he was out of place nobody is paying any
[19:03] attention to him
[19:05] they were too busy with other things
[19:07] although
[19:08] he was invited
[19:12] but he wasn't welcome when he come
[19:15] what happened to that foot wash flunky
[19:20] how did he ever miss that opportunity
[19:23] yeah
[19:24] i wish i would have had his opportunity
[19:27] oh my
[19:28] if i knew he'd be coming out i've been
[19:30] standing there waiting for him
[19:31] i i i'd been ready for it
[19:35] how did he do it
[19:38] now let's not condemn too much because
[19:41] we might do the same thing and not know
[19:42] it
[19:45] he missed him oh my
[19:52] notice he comes today to our callings
[19:55] too
[19:57] he comes in our midst
[20:02] now i don't want to say this but i i
[20:05] must say it
[20:07] and in our midst he's understood among
[20:10] us sitting there just as
[20:11] dirty to the people as he was then
[20:14] it's exactly right call them holy
[20:16] rollers and everything else
[20:18] and yet we cry for a revival
[20:21] and he comes and when he does come we
[20:24] treat him about like they did then
[20:28] somebody raised up in the spirit of god
[20:31] holler
[20:31] a man or scream or something like that
[20:34] when jesus
[20:34] happens to pass by why they put out the
[20:38] church
[20:42] well they think that's an awful shame to
[20:45] disgrace the church
[20:47] to people when it's jesus himself
[20:50] passing by
[20:52] and we can see him come and identify his
[20:54] word and do just like he did then and
[20:56] today they sense
[20:58] fortune telling mental telepathy or some
[21:01] evil spirit
[21:02] before the people he's just as dirty as
[21:04] he was
[21:05] sitting there jesus the word of god
[21:10] and we do nothing about it we're too
[21:13] interested in our organization or our
[21:16] our social standing we're ashamed to be
[21:20] called by his name
[21:22] we're actually ashamed of him
[21:26] they was ashamed of him because he was
[21:28] dirty
[21:30] the guests didn't know him and they was
[21:33] ashamed of him because he's dirty
[21:35] that's the way it is today they're still
[21:38] ashamed of him
[21:39] because they pile the dirt that they can
[21:42] upon call it holy rollers and everything
[21:45] else that they can think of
[21:47] nobody does nothing about it
[21:51] there he says dirty feet
[21:55] wallflower at the party wallflower
[21:58] in a religious meeting invited
[22:04] we asked him to come for revival when he
[22:06] comes we treat him the same way they did
[22:08] there
[22:09] he come and identify himself but nobody
[22:12] wants nothing to do with him
[22:15] if he can pull some kind of a gimmick or
[22:17] or or do some kind of a miracle like he
[22:20] did before pilate
[22:21] pilot his only opportunity he ever had
[22:23] and he asked he'd want to see something
[22:25] done
[22:26] won't it let's see some sign he ought to
[22:30] repent that's what this cruel
[22:34] hell-bound world ought to do tonight's
[22:36] repent of their sins
[22:37] that's what these church members ought
[22:39] to do repent of their
[22:41] unbelief stand up for him
[22:45] he's the same yesterday today and
[22:47] forever
[22:50] and he identifies himself just like he
[22:52] did then and the people today take the
[22:54] same attitude
[22:55] that pharisee took same kind of an
[22:58] attitude
[23:00] let him set after inviting him yet they
[23:03] don't want him
[23:04] they just do it like for manners he
[23:07] knows it
[23:10] we done to him today just like they did
[23:12] then
[23:14] instead of washing him
[23:17] washing his the reproach away instead of
[23:20] trying to stand up saying you're
[23:22] mistaken
[23:23] it's the word of god made manifest it's
[23:25] what he promised he said he poured out
[23:27] the spirit in the last days
[23:28] we're living in the last days instead of
[23:30] that we just kind of set back like they
[23:32] did
[23:34] we're afraid to take a stand
[23:37] why the i'm gonna raise up and say
[23:39] that's jesus of nazareth i believe he's
[23:41] a prophet of god
[23:43] you know the reason they didn't do it
[23:44] because they didn't believe he was a
[23:46] prophet
[23:47] and they still don't today they think
[23:50] he's an educator
[23:52] they think he's a denomination
[23:56] they don't know he's still a prophet
[23:57] that's what they're heading down there
[23:59] for in question
[24:02] that's the same thing as in question
[24:04] about today
[24:06] nobody's ready to take up for him they
[24:08] just say well you got nothing to do with
[24:09] him
[24:09] hey i belong to church there's my
[24:11] pastors all of them sitting around here
[24:13] i'm a good person
[24:14] and jesus with dirty feet
[24:18] nobody cared the very bible
[24:22] now we walk up and shake hands put our
[24:23] name on the book the methodists and they
[24:25] don't want us we'll take us towards the
[24:26] baptist and they kick this out we go to
[24:28] nazarenes
[24:29] the one that's kicked us out we go with
[24:30] tunis and the two of us kick us out we
[24:32] go to threeinus
[24:33] we don't have to put up with none of it
[24:35] all starchy
[24:37] yeah that's it's the same way and when
[24:40] jesus comes
[24:42] amen we don't even recognize we don't
[24:44] care that's right
[24:46] that's the way they do and yet we're
[24:48] crying come lord jesus come lord jesus
[24:50] and he comes and what do we do
[24:54] same thing they did why if they say
[24:58] anything except it
[24:59] somebody else will hear make fun of them
[25:02] and they let him set
[25:03] dirty it's called
[25:06] an evil spirit you remember jesus told
[25:09] him one day
[25:10] when they said this man does this by
[25:12] beelzebub he said you say that against
[25:14] me to be forgiven but someday the holy
[25:16] ghost will come to do the same thing and
[25:18] one word against it
[25:19] will never be forgiven
[25:23] there we are jesus with dirty feet
[25:28] could you imagine it could you imagine
[25:31] people who claim to love god
[25:34] and it got so mixed up in their creeds
[25:36] and their denominations and isms
[25:38] jesus said your traditions you've made
[25:40] the word of god of no effect
[25:43] there he was there and the word was in
[25:45] effect
[25:46] because it was made flesh and was proven
[25:49] exactly
[25:50] that he was the christ and the people
[25:53] with their traditions
[25:54] wouldn't let it be effective upon the
[25:56] other people that's what he was doing
[25:58] trying to show it off if see they didn't
[26:01] believe he was a prophet
[26:03] and yet the bible said he would be a
[26:05] prophet
[26:07] the bible moses said the lord your god
[26:10] shall raise up a prophet romans 18 15.
[26:12] and the bible predicted just exactly
[26:14] what he would do and here he come doing
[26:16] it
[26:16] among those people and today
[26:20] we leave him with just his dirty name as
[26:22] he had then
[26:24] let him say things against it in the
[26:25] days of miracles his pastors though such
[26:27] a thing
[26:28] when the bible said he's the same
[26:29] yesterday today and forever
[26:32] and we're still ashamed to stand out and
[26:34] say something about it
[26:37] we're ashamed of our testimony that we
[26:39] we claim we believe
[26:42] instead of washing him trying to
[26:45] wash him with tears of joy that he's
[26:47] here we just let him sit dirty
[26:51] i won't have not do it i ain't
[26:52] cooperating nothing like that put my
[26:53] hand on it
[26:55] there you are it's the same bunch of
[26:58] pharisees
[27:00] just under another name
[27:03] we again let him set like that for the
[27:05] same reason we don't believe he's a
[27:07] prophet
[27:08] we're ashamed of it why the same reason
[27:11] we don't believe it the people don't
[27:13] know sir he can come and do whatever he
[27:15] wishes to
[27:16] they're setting their ways and there's
[27:17] nobody to try to fool with him and you
[27:19] know the bible said they'd be that way
[27:21] exactly the bible said they'd be that
[27:23] way lukewarm
[27:27] form of godliness to have no power
[27:29] thereof i think
[27:30] that's right we join up with this
[27:34] educational polished up group standing
[27:36] there and having our big socials and
[27:38] times
[27:38] our fine churches and find decorations
[27:40] then jesus christ can come in and you
[27:42] let him stay dirty
[27:44] the word can be made manifest among us
[27:46] and we still walk around let people talk
[27:47] about it
[27:49] oh my god
[27:52] but you know to hurry with our story
[27:55] let's change the scene tonight
[27:58] let's turn our cameras another way way
[28:01] down in the alley
[28:04] a little old dirty alley
[28:09] way up in the top of a little old room
[28:11] that was
[28:12] barbara the bar the door comes open
[28:16] and a woman steps out
[28:20] well she wasn't very well liked among
[28:23] the people
[28:25] she was a center
[28:28] and she made her living in the wrong way
[28:31] so she strolls out down the little
[28:33] creaking steps
[28:35] she gets into the alley and she goes
[28:37] down all along the garbage cans and
[28:39] goes out on the street well there's
[28:41] nobody out there
[28:44] so she begins to wonder what some oh i
[28:46] remember
[28:47] pharisee up there pastor pharisee he's
[28:51] uh given a big banquet everybody's up
[28:53] there
[28:54] business will be bad today so she
[28:57] mows us down the street and as she
[28:59] begins to walk and say well i'll just
[29:00] have to wait till that's over
[29:02] and she made her living in a bad way
[29:06] so she was walking down the street and
[29:07] after a while her little
[29:09] hungry stomach smell that roasted lamb
[29:14] my heart smells good never had anything
[29:16] like i had to eat in my life
[29:18] maybe been turned out on the street by
[29:21] some
[29:21] parents you know a lot of times we think
[29:24] about juvenile delinquency i think a
[29:26] whole lot of it is parent delinquency
[29:30] the kids have been taught to pray and
[29:33] serve god instead of
[29:35] mama out somewhere at a card party and
[29:37] her religious card party and
[29:42] dad out of the golf course somewhere and
[29:47] sister out with junior out there on the
[29:50] street
[29:51] running around maybe things have been
[29:53] different had the old-fashioned prayer
[29:55] altar
[29:57] the bible instead of a deck of cards and
[30:00] throwed that television out the door a
[30:01] long time ago
[30:03] and it might have been a whole lot
[30:05] different y'all used to be wrong go
[30:06] to pictures show the devil put it right
[30:07] over on her she brought it right in her
[30:08] house
[30:14] she's hungry she smelled man
[30:17] she said my smells good i wonder really
[30:20] how a piece of roasted lamb would
[30:22] really taste in a human's mouth i don't
[30:25] know how it would be i believe i'll just
[30:26] walk up now she couldn't get too close
[30:28] to him because she was
[30:29] a woman they were self-righteous you see
[30:31] they all belong to church
[30:33] so they couldn't get around where is
[30:36] that
[30:38] she was considered a sinner so if she
[30:41] walked up close and if you can look
[30:43] around see no of them standing there no
[30:45] water running out of their mouth is a
[30:47] gasp you know looking at this ram or
[30:50] lamb in there roasting and
[30:51] all the fine foods and things being
[30:54] packed around in there
[30:55] what a great time and she began to look
[30:57] through the crowd like that
[31:00] and her eyes fell upon me
[31:03] who's that he's got dirty feet
[31:07] i wonder who's that what if somebody
[31:09] would tell me say will you
[31:11] turns away real quick won't nothing do
[31:13] with her she's a sinner
[31:16] so ask somebody else finally maybe a
[31:18] little lady that
[31:19] was believing and looking the same way
[31:22] said uh
[31:23] madam pardon me but would you who is
[31:26] that sitting there how did
[31:27] that person well he said you know who
[31:28] that is did you hear him talk about
[31:31] that jesus of nazareth is supposed to be
[31:32] a prophet oh yes
[31:34] is that him that's him well he isn't
[31:38] washed
[31:39] i understood that everybody is forced to
[31:41] be washed before they come in there and
[31:43] anointed look at him well it's not right
[31:47] she had an opportunity presented to her
[31:49] she remembered a story
[31:50] that someone told her another woman of
[31:53] her trade
[31:54] one time
[32:02] [Music]
[32:11] [Music]
[32:40] so
[32:48] [Music]
[33:19] you
