[6:23] cause that little germ that was in you
[6:25] was to be you before the foundation the
[6:29] world puts her name in the Lamb's Book
[6:31] of Life like my little ego story all of
[6:34] these heard he had old farmer setter and
[6:37] uh he had one time they said have enough
[6:39] here that age to bore the hen so then he
[6:42] found the eagle egg and they put it on
[6:44] her mother Eagle was born as a
[6:45] funny-looking chicken and chickens ever
[6:46] seen little o we go go along to hear to
[6:49] go cluck cluck cluck cluck little Eagle
[6:51] says how does another thing say I'm
[6:52] saying but I'm followed her anyhow
[6:54] anyone have the barnyard and to get his
[6:56] stretched in manure piles and she cook
[6:59] look look this is good this is good you
[7:00] join ours this is what another ego he
[7:04] could eat that stuff
[7:09] he just he just went along with the
[7:11] chicken because he didn't know he didn't
[7:14] know what to do and then I should get
[7:17] this for that little Eagle just he just
[7:20] had a stomach in study he didn't know
[7:22] how to do it but you know what chickens
[7:24] doing it but there's something different
[7:25] he didn't like that so one day the
[7:27] mother told that late so she begin
[7:33] a hunt for that other one lying around
[7:36] searching like the great Holy Spirit one
[7:41] day flew over the barnyard that

[24:57] cheap on to certain churches she said I
[25:00] says this separation that's it what's
[25:02] the matter said we're a different faith

[25:17] the Roman Catholic Church started all
[25:19] Pentecostal I mean it was that true it
[25:22] taken 2,000 years to get worst got now
[25:24] just don't take nothing in the scripture
[25:26] Noble nothing while the Pentecost on
[25:29] twenty years then I'll be worse than
[25:30] they are now they gave something rolled
[25:32] away it is now washer see what it isn't
[25:34] what is it look at their Papa mama is
[25:37] let the women cut their hair they could
[25:39] you dare anything they'd remove the
[25:41] bones in this chair settle oh no wonder
[25:45] no wonder the damnation of God picked up
[25:49] God put it right before your eyes you
[25:50] shut your eyes and fail to look at it
[25:53] shut up your bowels of compassion when
[25:55] you see the true Word of God in these
[25:57] seven seals been vindicated and proved
[25:59] to be sowing witness in the heavens
[26:01] across the nations and everywhere else
[26:02] for great signs and wonders that he
[26:04] promised he was his
[26:07] then you shut up so I can jump on oh my
[26:11] dad and don't know it thieves and
[26:14] trespasses you said oh we all know that
[26:18] the church in that condition couldn't
[26:20] finish up this last day how could it
[26:21] bring Malachi 4 Ian hey how could it do
[26:25] it they don't even believe in such a
[26:26] thing
[26:26] hey man how could it believe living in
[26:29] Luke 17 30 - bringing all these other
[26:31] scriptures has promised this I think it
[26:33] could do because it denies as it was in
[26:38] the days of lot so shall it be in the
[26:41] coming of the Son of Man look at the
[26:42] additions a lot as Sodom was in in that
[26:44] day look condition the church in the day
[26:45] look what happened to ever Abraham they
[26:47] elected look what happened to the
[26:49] locking them down and Sodom look at the
[26:51] Billy Graham and old robbers name down
[26:52] there amongst all denominations look at
[26:54] the elected Abraham Church pulled out
[26:56] look what kind of sign that Jesus
[26:58] himself the incarnated God Stanner
[27:01] in human flesh you said that was an
[27:03] angel the Bible studies of God Lord God
[27:07] Illium better than human flesh showing
[27:10] that you would I saw anointest church in
[27:12] the last days if he God working in human
[27:14] flesh again as it was in the days of
[27:16] Sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[27:18] the Son of Man same kind of a thing this
[27:21] sit right there the scriptures please
[27:23] just search the Scriptures for in them
[27:24] you think you have eternal life and
[27:26] there they just testify this so we know
[27:31] they're dead God let it die in its own
[27:35] selfish scientific educational program
[27:38] all the Pentecostals used to talk about
[27:41] about son and kid away to Bible screw
[27:43] back
[27:43] we're all brothers loud members around
[27:44] here running out of the church but all
[27:47] now it's a great thing my son's away in
[27:50] Bible shooting diggities green so good
[27:54] oh you think they could take it today
[27:57] you think I'm trying to support
[27:59] ignorance I'm not I'm telling you
[28:01] there's a difference between this
[28:03] intellectual age that we're living in
[28:05] where the church has been pregnant with
[28:07] science and all these so-called figured
[28:09] out and everything you don't figure out
[28:11] God well then that priest had God
[28:13] figured out so perfectly note how the
[28:14] Messiah was going to come but he comes
[28:16] so different what they had figured out
[28:18] it wasn't scientific
[28:19] how could this may have been an
[28:21] illegitimate child where'd he go to
[28:22] school at Gordy's education come from or
[28:25] to get this dirty well you try to teach
[28:27] us you're born in fornications hey halt
[28:30] for goodness sake see the same thing
[28:32] repeat again they repeat again all in
[28:35] their religious sign religious science
[28:37] according to what their Bible school
[28:39] says that's the way they would that's
[28:43] where it has to be there isn't God just
[28:45] fools and every time it always comes
[28:47] different it didn't know it's time just
[28:48] forces times in Christ time didn't John
[28:50] times in disciples time didn't Wesley's
[28:52] time didn't lose their time didn't
[28:53] pentecostal time and so hazard to you
[28:55] don't change his pattern always comes
[28:58] the same thing only farmers to them
[29:00] seven six ages to the seventh in
[29:01] Revelation ten set this hour a change
[29:05] and then how we're closing the Sandia's
[29:08] finish up the Great Commission how could
[29:11] they do it we know they're dead
[29:13] God let it die in a scientific age all
[29:15] of it so so he could do all open up the
[29:18] seven sealed mystery to the under
[29:22] nomination or bribed how candidate
[29:25] nomination except those seven seals when
[29:28] it's absolutely contrary serpentine and
[29:30] all those other things the whole four
[29:32] seven mysteries is contrary to what they
[29:33] did because they took the old spool from
[29:36] the Bible School and the seven seals of
[29:38] God is open there on the mountain let
[29:40] God lo let me die right now this pulpit
[29:42] at that ain't the truth now for told you
[29:44] years six months for my told me go to
[29:46] Arizona what would happen out there in a
[29:47] desert and this man sitting out here
[29:49] tonight we're standing right there in
[29:51] prison when the seven angels come down
[29:52] and even made the magazine Life magazine
[29:56] back to article evidence right there

[29:58] don't even know what's all about
[30:00] and everything has been said all even to
[30:03] the destruction of California coming up
[30:05] now and all these other things and how
[30:06] it told me how many days would be how it
[30:08] would be were this big earthquake happen
[30:09] Alaska that would be the beginning of
[30:11] the sign of time and what would take
[30:13] place and just word by word what it said
[30:15] it's never fail one time you'll never
[30:17] see it fail and it can't fail because
[30:20] it's God's words inhabited I saw a boy
[30:23] but I can't Hey
[30:28] God had opened up those seven seals
[30:31] knock in the denomination I've always
[30:34] been against it but our denomination he
[30:37] might take a bribe not a denominational
[30:40] brat he couldn't do it it's against his
[30:42] own word you open those seven mysteries
[30:45] in there
[30:46] this shows fourth brings forth those
[30:47] things it's been here since the
[30:48] foundation of the world might be
