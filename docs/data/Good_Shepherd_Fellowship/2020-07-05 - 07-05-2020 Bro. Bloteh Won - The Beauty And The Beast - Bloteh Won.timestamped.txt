[20:24] watching
[20:29] [Music]
[21:30] praise Lord
[21:36] when we think about independence that's
[21:39] what we think about remain that we are
[21:42] glad that we found out that he could
[21:45] bring us out Amy
[21:47] praise the Lord praise the Lord once
[21:51] again we greet you all in the name of
[21:53] the Lord Jesus thank you better area for
[21:55] stepping in and helping
[21:57] this morning
[22:00] praise the Lord
[22:03] this morning I want to I want speak on a
[22:08] little thought that came to my mind
[22:12] but my inspiration will be the position
[22:16] of the bride to this present world with
[22:19] everything that is going on what is our
[22:21] position what why are we here for why
[22:25] God has kept us in such a time that's
[22:29] why we will be speaking about but we
[22:31] will take our our inspiration from the
[22:34] book of 1st
[22:36] Samuel so I will title my message the
[22:40] Beauty and the Beast
[22:43] that's what I would touch on my message
[22:47] praise the Lord and I will remind you of
[22:50] your childhood book but there is good
[22:53] praise Lord when I taught on this
[22:56] speaking on this actually I went to look
[22:59] for that little book the Beauty and the
[23:01] Beast and I have me and my little girl
[23:03] watch it so you know when I'm coming
[23:06] from this morning in me and coming from
[23:09] a little cat unum I want to speak on the
[23:13] beauty of the beast the Beauty and the
[23:15] Beast now as I said in Isaiah chapter 4
[23:20] the prophecy of
[23:22] seven women we take hold of one man but
[23:26] in verse two he said the branch of the
[23:29] Lord will be beautiful so
[23:32] this this there's a group that will
[23:35] spring out there will be a branch that
[23:37] will spring out right in that time that
[23:41] we have such a beauty her beauty will
[23:43] now be an outdoor presentation her
[23:46] beauty will be such a character that she
[23:48] would bring in this difficult time
[23:50] because the time of seven women taking
[23:53] the hold of one man saying we will have
[23:55] our own food we'll have our own apparel
[23:58] is the presentation of the seven Church
[24:01] ages that has come to the World Council
[24:04] of Churches
[24:05] so in this time in that period of time
[24:08] there is there is a branch that will
[24:11] spring out that will be beautiful so
[24:13] it's that branch her position in this
[24:17] time of chaos I mean is in such a time
[24:21] word
[24:23] like looking at as I a prophecy in this
[24:27] time were I believe as I coming out with
[24:31] that with their prophecies everybody's
[24:33] thinking wow I mean it's really going to
[24:36] be serious I mean seven women are we
[24:38] going to go to war or what is going to
[24:40] happen you know are they going to kill
[24:42] all our men you know that women will be
[24:45] in you know in such a desperate state
[24:47] but we know that it was a prophecy that
[24:51] I was speaking about a time when Israel
[24:56] or when the church would drift away from
[24:59] the Word of God you know they we don't
[25:01] do we want they would want their own
[25:04] appealing gospel you know like brother
[25:07] Branham said in thinking's man feather
[25:10] you know they want something that will
[25:12] be able to appear to them that we get
[25:14] away from the world the Council of
[25:16] Churches has given them you know their
[25:20] doctrine in the sense that they have to
[25:22] follow everything that in economica
[25:25] Council has set together you know if you
[25:28] don't believe in a Trinity you cannot be
[25:30] part of that Council so they have their
[25:32] own bread you know and they have their
[25:34] own
[25:35] presentation which is their apparel but
[25:38] in that time in that very same time
[25:41] there is going to be a branch of the
[25:44] Lord that will be beautiful so that's
[25:46] what we want to look at this morning we
[25:49] want to look at their branch of the Lord
[25:51] so seeing that that description of as
[25:56] I'm false in Revelation chapter 3 the
[26:01] age of loud assured and if there is ever
[26:04] a time where the world has come to a
[26:06] beast condition is this time
[26:09] you know it's this time word I mean
[26:14] well I mean the heart of man and it's
[26:18] it's all because the Holy Spirit is
[26:21] leaving the earth
[26:24] you know when the Holy Spirit was moving
[26:27] around the earth even even sinners even
[26:30] sinners God could touch the conscience
[26:33] of sinners for them to realize you know
[26:36] I mean people will be will be you know
[26:40] still drunken and smoking and yet you
[26:43] could tell them something about the love
[26:45] of God you know they will be drawing in
[26:48] tears who comes from come from the eyes
[26:50] I remember
[26:52] many years back when we first gave our
[26:56] heart to the Lord we used to do Street
[26:59] witnessing so one night after service we
[27:02] went into the street to witness and I
[27:06] still remember this it stand out to me
[27:10] because one of the local church back
[27:11] home they had the assembly right on
[27:14] their Street word is happen it was in
[27:16] the night and you know that pitch black
[27:19] because there's no electricity you know
[27:22] so I broke away from the brothers and I
[27:25] decided I was going to go on my own then
[27:28] I to to just to witness to testify to
[27:31] someone and as I was walking in this
[27:35] dark Street only thing I could see
[27:37] coming down the road was was a man
[27:39] smoking I don't know how he looks like
[27:42] because I couldn't see his face I can
[27:44] just see the real light from his mouth
[27:46] you know faith man he put it down put it
[27:48] back to his mouth he put it down and I
[27:50] was going straight in his direction
[27:52] I'll break myself of young man at the
[27:55] time I'll just walk straight in his
[27:58] direction and I can tell you
[28:01] I would not I would not want to say the
[28:04] man came on a strong conviction that he
[28:08] had met an angel he was scary because it
[28:10] was that
[28:11] didn't know who I was and I - I say
[28:15] young man I was scary because I didn't
[28:16] know who he was you know so I walked
[28:21] straight to him and I just I stood
[28:24] before him and he stopped and he had his
[28:26] his cigarette there so I told him you
[28:29] know what I you know I want to push to
[28:32] you tonight I want to tell you about the
[28:34] love of God do you know that is you know
[28:36] just young young young a Christian at a
[28:39] time you know the cigarette is not good
[28:41] for you you know and and I preached to
[28:43] him and you know the Lord Jesus is
[28:45] coming back soon II what I was talking
[28:47] to him I mean he just dropped his
[28:49] cigarette on the ground I don't know
[28:50] whether he did it or fear of conviction
[28:52] but you know it was good that I mean he
[28:54] spared their stick what he lied another
[28:56] one later well the Lord knows the rest
[28:58] of the story but you know in the end of
[29:01] time of the revival when when I mean
[29:04] when when the Holy Ghost was moving on
[29:06] the earth like you see it on the days of
[29:09] Pentecost and even you know when when
[29:12] when man like a a aliens and different
[29:16] revivalist was moving around the country
[29:18] you know brother branham having this
[29:20] meeting even those people you know they
[29:24] were not fully convicted but because the
[29:26] Holy Spirit was here I mean it had it
[29:30] brought some sense of sanity to people's
[29:32] mind you know they could they could have
[29:35] a little sense of discernment between
[29:38] right and wrong but we're living in such
[29:40] a time because that spirit is leaving
[29:43] the earth before we read a scripture I
[29:45] have you stand let's just let's just do
[29:47] something little this morning in a book
[29:49] of it please TRC don't stand we're not
[29:51] reading the scripture here I'm trying to
[29:54] do this to have my step going so les
[30:01] [Music]
[30:03] chapter 3
[30:06] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 let's let's look
[30:09] at something there
[30:11] [Music]
[30:13] being reading this book at home and they
[30:17] also helped me to kind of be revealing
[30:20] some few things now in Chapter three you
[30:24] realize that's where Solomon said to
[30:27] everything there is a season and a time
[30:30] and a purpose under the heaven praise
[30:34] the Lord but in a verse 11 he says this
[30:40] speaking about the Lord
[30:42] he have made everything beautiful in his
[30:47] time
[30:49] also he have said
[30:54] the word in the heart
[30:59] so that no man can find out the work
[31:04] that God
[31:06] make it from the beginning to the end
[31:10] now if you if you study this you realize
[31:14] that this word the Solomon is talking
[31:18] about here it speaks about
[31:21] internetting it speaks that God has
[31:25] placed internally not internal life
[31:29] internally and the reason why I want to
[31:32] I want to I want to deal with this
[31:34] because there are few verses down also I
[31:36] want for us to read but see where this
[31:38] would go with this talk God has placed
[31:41] there you have to remember that when
[31:43] when God made man he breathed into man
[31:47] and man became a living soul so that
[31:52] influence of God that makes us above the
[31:55] animals which is the breath of God the
[31:59] thing that drives our soul is is a sense
[32:04] of antenna it's a sense of internally
[32:06] now that every man has antenna life but
[32:10] every man has a soul and the soul is
[32:14] something that comes from God that's
[32:16] what makes us of higher intelligence
[32:19] than the animal
[32:21] that is the reason why make an event why
[32:26] why man and inventing is because he
[32:29] comes from a creator he can create but
[32:32] he can take what God has created and
[32:35] make something out of it
[32:37] he don't have to be a born-again
[32:40] Christian for him to invent something
[32:43] but it's in every man to be able to make
[32:47] something whether you take
[32:51] some some some some few leaves and make
[32:55] a food for you to eat I mean it's a
[32:57] sense of creation you have turned
[32:58] something from one state to another
[33:00] state
[33:02] praise the Lord so it's amen and where
[33:06] does that comes from it comes from the
[33:09] breath of God
[33:11] that's the thing that lasts in the soul
[33:13] of man okay let's go down a little bit
[33:16] here praise the Lord
[33:19] I'm throwing mine my bed out this
[33:23] morning and I think I'm getting a good
[33:25] catch amen praise the Lord
[33:29] amen let's look down in verse 18
[33:35] let's look down in verse 18
[33:41] verse 17 he says I
[33:44] said in my heart God shall judge the
[33:48] raptures and the wicked for there is a
[33:52] time
[33:54] there for every person in and for every
[33:59] work and I said in my heart concerning
[34:03] the state of the sons of men
[34:07] the sons of man see the way he said
[34:10] every man that is born of a woman is the
[34:14] sons of man I mean he says I'm speaking
[34:18] out about the state of the sons of man
[34:20] that God my manifest him and their them
[34:25] my see that they themselves are beasts
[34:30] did himself abyss for for that wish
[34:36] befalleth the the sons of man before
[34:38] abyss
[34:40] even one thing before of them as
[34:47] as the one thing before that no as one
[34:53] die so die the other yay they have all
[34:58] won birth so that a man have no
[35:03] preeminence above
[35:05] obese for all is vanity
[35:10] all go on to one place all of the dust
[35:16] in all return to the dust who knoweth
[35:20] the spirit of man that go upward nan
[35:25] that's where he's drawing the difference
[35:27] now because men have a soul so his
[35:31] spirit go up walk and the beasts go it
[35:34] down war are we together who know where
[35:38] the spirit of man that goeth upward and
[35:41] the spirit of the Beast that goeth
[35:44] downward to the earth so yes it a
[35:48] Solomon year is trying to make us to see
[35:51] it is that thing that God has played in
[35:55] the heart of man which of course bird
[35:57] brain MC is the small compartment where
[35:59] there is no blood he says that place is
[36:03] the soul and and and and God has placed
[36:08] there you know he pleased that in in the
[36:11] heart of man and and
[36:14] so every man has their you know every
[36:17] man has dead every man has has a soul
[36:21] and that's word God i occupy for the
[36:24] believer that's what we're going to talk
[36:26] about a little bit this morning as we
[36:28] would look into the Troon of mercy that
[36:30] is where God occupies for the believer
[36:32] when when the Spirit of God comes when
[36:35] the Holy Ghost comes the portion of God
[36:38] a portion of his antenna light it comes
[36:42] right into that place where blood does
[36:44] not occupy and that is the only thing
[36:47] that is different from between a man and
[36:51] a beasts that's what Solomon was saying
[36:54] here he realized that God has placed
[36:57] internally in a heart of man God has
[36:59] placed something in the heart of man too
[37:02] long after him because man was made in
[37:05] the image of God but beside that
[37:09] the same thing that we follow the Beast
[37:11] that's the same thing that we follow the
[37:13] man
[37:15] praise the Lord amen
[37:18] the Beast smell we also smell
[37:24] praise the Lord
[37:26] the same thing that we follow the Beast
[37:27] that's the same thing that we follow us
[37:29] you know so but why I'm drawing to this
[37:34] is because the the Spirit of God the
[37:39] Holy Ghost that's supposed to influence
[37:42] a man upward is now leaving man so if a
[37:46] man is left without the Spirit of God
[37:48] he's going to be nothing but a beast
[37:55] he's going to be nothing but a cruel
[37:58] beasts
[38:01] let's think for the word of God this
[38:03] morning I think I already got you on the
[38:04] hook so we can be able to go right now
[38:07] he may praise the Lord I learned some of
[38:12] the brothers but every day they got the
[38:14] brothers got him okay some of the
[38:17] brothers from from Iowa some of the
[38:20] young brothers they were coming to
[38:22] celebrate with us our first day in
[38:24] church and oh my goodness we just pray
[38:28] that God will be merciful on those men
[38:30] working for us

[38:37] they might have a time of fellowship at
[38:40] my place playing music singing
[38:42] testifying this afternoon so

[38:48] praise the Lord so the
[38:52] the party continues

[43:47] think you see where we go in already so
[43:52] that's that's that's good that's good
[43:55] but we will we will go right back to the
[43:58] book of 1st Samuel chapter 25 there are
[44:00] a few things we want to pick up them now
[44:03] the Bible talks and describe Abigail
[44:06] Abigail means joy the joy of her father
[44:11] the joy of her father and
[44:17] you know I was I was thinking about it
[44:20] as I was studying the subject and I
[44:23] talked as he saw you know like someone
[44:26] said I heard someone saying this he said
[44:29] he says
[44:32] he said it like did she said
[44:35] when I find my wife he says I hit the
[44:39] jackpot
[44:40] [Laughter]
[44:43] praise the Lord
[44:47] and
[44:49] as we look at the character of
[44:53] Abigail that's what I was thinking as
[44:55] his never he hit the jackpot when he
[44:58] found his girl praise the Lord and and
[45:02] how many times but I think I think here
[45:06] you know it's a is
[45:08] you know is is it's a good statement in
[45:12] one sense I know we never supposed to be
[45:15] talking gambling your jackpot in one of
[45:18] you but
[45:20] [Laughter]
[45:23] firstly
[45:25] amen but you know I'm trying to bring it
[45:29] out in a way for us to be able to
[45:32] appreciate what God gave us the Bible
[45:35] says out of sedation you know you know
[45:39] God liking the gift of a wife or the
[45:44] husband you know - as much there is a
[45:47] lot of thing behind it because our our
[45:50] or our salvation is is is tied to it in
[45:54] one way or the other because Paul said
[45:57] in the book of efficient you know that a
[46:00] marriage is a mystery you know so the
[46:04] one that God would put in our life he
[46:08] going to use that person to be able to
[46:12] deal with some witnesses and he will use
[46:15] their person to be able to bring out
[46:17] some things that that even the pulpit
[46:20] will not be able to bring out
[46:22] praise the Lord so it's the mystery that
[46:25] is in marriage you know and I and I fear
[46:28] that is it's a fair statement you know
[46:30] you know you sometimes you you you I
[46:33] mean you see some couple uses oh my
[46:35] goodness I wonder how he got that wife I
[46:37] mean that that woman is saying
[46:40] but I think that I
[46:45] think there you know it is so good there
[46:49] I'm preaching the service hearing
[46:52] everybody's at home praise the Lord
[46:55] I
[46:56] know I will see eyes that will be
[46:59] crossing the cross and I will be
[47:01] distracted so
[47:05] but I think you know it is a fair
[47:07] statement and every woman should feel
[47:10] they are we in her heart and every man
[47:13] also should feel that way in his heart
[47:16] there
[47:18] whoever the law gave to them as they are
[47:22] made you know
[47:25] it was it was a blessing from the Lord
[47:27] you know but as as we look into into
[47:32] this gentleman's story we will realize
[47:34] there
[47:35] he never appreciated that blessing
[47:38] because the scripture right from the
[47:41] beginning right from the beginning
[47:43] introducing Abigail the Bible says she
[47:46] was a woman of an
[47:49] understanding heart and
[47:52] and and you will see that
[47:58] the scripture deals with that you know
[48:02] the scripture deals with the earth
[48:03] Solomon in a book of Proverbs there were
[48:05] three things that he line now and and
[48:08] the way he talks about them he talks
[48:10] about wisdom he talks about knowledge he
[48:14] talks about understanding and
[48:17] understanding comes right between wisdom
[48:21] and knowledge
[48:24] because wisdom is the right way to use
[48:27] knowledge
[48:30] and for the man or a woman to rightly
[48:34] use knowledge you have to have an
[48:37] understanding heart
[48:41] there are a lot of people that have
[48:43] great knowledge but they don't have
[48:45] wisdom
[48:49] they have great knowledge I mean the
[48:51] wise and and and poor in in Iran chapter
[48:57] 9 there was where he was kneeling the
[49:00] Jews he's in my bread rings
[49:03] he says my old bread is my own King Fox
[49:07] they have the knowledge of the law
[49:11] but never have wisdom to understand what
[49:14] God was doing in changing the
[49:17] disposition
[49:21] so understanding comes understanding
[49:24] holds the hands of wisdom and knowledge
[49:29] and then it makes all three of them a
[49:33] blessing
[49:34] so a man can have great knowledge
[49:38] but if you don't have wisdom he can even
[49:42] hang himself
[49:43] with all he knows
[49:48] are we together so the Bible speaks of
[49:52] Abigail here that she was a woman a
[49:57] daughter with an understanding heart an
[50:03] understanding heart
[50:07] and of a beautiful countenance
[50:11] praise the Lord
[50:13] so we're looking at though
[50:18] the Beauty and the Beast
[50:21] the beauty is too bright
[50:25] the farm herself in the house of
[50:28] neighbor
[50:30] our house of neighbor is loudest age
[50:33] reach in increase in goals and
[50:37] and and foolish
[50:40] praise the Lord
[50:42] so as we as we look at this there are a
[50:46] few things I want for us to look here
[50:48] let's go back to - to that
[50:51] chapter 25 and we will see some of the
[50:55] things you know that is described in the
[50:58] life of Abigail some of the things that
[51:00] play out in the life of Abigail that
[51:03] shows that she was a woman of an
[51:05] understanding hat I think we all know
[51:08] the story about it we know the story if
[51:11] you don't you can you can go back and
[51:13] read in
[51:16] but there is something I want to get to
[51:18] here praise the Lord
[51:24] let's look
[51:32] David Mann has axe the man of never on
[51:37] the field shielding their ships and
[51:40] everything and said well we have been
[51:42] here I mean we've been we've been
[51:44] watching over you people and you know
[51:46] protecting you P you know tell your
[51:48] master and when to tell him and you know
[51:51] and he was I mean he was he was very
[51:54] arrogant and all of that and and and
[51:57] those men came down the Bible says and
[51:59] the young man came down and it told
[52:01] Abigail that is him for his 14 I'm
[52:04] trying to skip a little bit here and
[52:08] verse 18 and
[52:10] Abigail make his after she have heard
[52:13] that and she took she took 200 loaves
[52:18] and two and
[52:20] bottles of wine and and five ships ready
[52:25] dress and five measure of posh calm and
[52:30] 500 you know raising and 200 kicks off a
[52:35] and she laid him on an ask and she got
[52:38] out there to meet David
[52:40] now verse 20 and it was so as she rolled
[52:45] on the ass that she came down by the
[52:49] cover of the hill and behold David and
[52:52] his men came down against her and she
[52:56] met she met him
[53:01] now
[53:02] David has said surely in vain have I
[53:06] kept all that
[53:08] this fellow had in the witness so that
[53:12] nothing was missed in all that petty
[53:15] neuron to him and he had reward a mean
[53:19] evil for good so and more also do God on
[53:24] to the enemies of David if I live if I
[53:29] live of all the petty known to him by
[53:33] the morning light ended that peace that
[53:35] he gave the wall and when Abigail saw
[53:39] David she hasted and in light of all the
[53:42] eyes she fell before David on her face
[53:45] and bow herself to the ground and fell
[53:49] at his feet and said unto him my lord
[53:54] upon me let this iniquity be
[54:00] praised alone and left donghae me I pray
[54:05] thee speak in an audience and hear the
[54:10] words all done him me let met my lord I
[54:14] pray thee regard this man of a b-line
[54:19] even regard even noble
[54:23] for us his name is Sol
[54:28] Sol is he never is his name and fall it
[54:33] is with him there was something I want
[54:36] to get to you but I didn't hear me saw
[54:39] not a young man of my Lord whom they are
[54:42] saying now therefore my lord
[54:44] asked the Lord living and as thy soul
[54:48] liveth seeing the Lord
[54:52] have withholding thee from from coming
[54:56] to sheer blood
[54:57] and from avenging thyself with thine own
[55:03] hands now let thine enemy and they that
[55:08] seek evil to my lord be as never now and
[55:16] now the blessing wish that him may has
[55:19] brought unto my lord let it be given to
[55:24] the young man that follow my law now
[55:26] this is what I want to get you now I
[55:29] pray thee I pray thee now watch this now
[55:33] I pray thee
[55:36] forgive the trespass of the hemming
[55:41] for the Lord will surely make my lord a
[55:47] sure house now thou wert a sure house
[55:51] now here is Abigail
[55:55] the one thing there that is that is
[55:57] there is that Abigail
[55:59] she's playing out an intercession
[56:03] ministry
[56:04] she's interceding
[56:07] and she's she she she does herself in
[56:10] the gap
[56:12] realizing that what she has heard
[56:15] judgment is coming to her house
[56:17] blood is going to run down the living
[56:20] room the bedroom wherever nel but is
[56:22] going to be sleeping and David said
[56:24] every man that pitted against the wall
[56:26] all the male were going to be
[56:28] slaughtered
[56:30] now she had not heard what they were
[56:33] saying
[56:34] she had not heard but Naurang the
[56:38] foolishness of her husband is going to
[56:41] cause the death of the house and she
[56:44] know that if she don't do nothing about
[56:48] it in my evening calls for light because
[56:50] no I mean nobody would know who is the
[56:52] wife who is the seven those men comes I
[56:55] mean they're there they're giving order
[56:57] and they would just go through the house
[57:00] praise the Lord
[57:03] so she's taking a ministry to intercede
[57:08] and because she's burning with this
[57:12] thing now washing see was going to happy
[57:15] because she's burning she comes and she
[57:18] threw herself down the Bible says
[57:21] greater love love no man than for the
[57:24] man to lay down his life I'm talking
[57:27] about the bride now so keep keep the
[57:29] bride that's our position that's the
[57:31] reason why we are in this age and all of
[57:34] these things are happening around us
[57:36] they evil the politics the wickedness of
[57:38] the house of the people the rejection of
[57:41] the Word of God and all of these things
[57:42] now if those things are given us a wrong
[57:46] attitude then we have to check ourselves
[57:49] we are missing our position
[57:53] because I call into the scripture when
[57:57] seen about
[57:59] grace much more abound so grace is on
[58:04] the people of God
[58:08] say it's on the people of God as the
[58:12] word increase in unrighteousness and
[58:15] wickedness oh
[58:16] mercy should flow from our heart we
[58:20] should drive down our car with tears
[58:23] coming from our eyes and saying God have
[58:26] mercy how can a young man run around the
[58:29] street like this how can a young woman
[58:31] go down though how can she live Allah
[58:33] have mercy
[58:36] are we together and have the
[58:40] intra-syrian
[58:41] not a heart that criticized
[58:50] because we think I mean we have we have
[58:54] made a rapture you better wait until you
[58:55] get in the rapture find yourself on the
[58:58] other side before you start to praise
[58:59] and boast about the rapture not now many
[59:03] men has confessed this rapture and dance
[59:06] in it and yet instead they have gone far
[59:08] away from the grace of this truth
[59:11] praise the Lord
[59:13] she threw herself down before dev a
[59:17] flat to the floor
[59:19] you have to remember this woman is an
[59:22] honourable woman
[59:24] she said respect a woman because her
[59:27] husband is a wealthy man
[59:32] she did not care about
[59:35] how much her robbed Club cost
[59:42] praise the Lord I
[59:45] mean she didn't care how much it costs
[59:49] she true or self flat to the floor
[59:53] praise the Lord I've seen those things
[59:56] you know when people want to make scene
[59:58] you know and and
[1:00:00] or they're already pre plain in your
[1:00:03] mind are they going to be humble so they
[1:00:05] look for you know the clothes they all
[1:00:07] clothes they wear it because they have
[1:00:09] pre plain in your mind you're going to
[1:00:10] be humbled today I'm you're going to
[1:00:12] throw myself down that because this
[1:00:14] clothes does not cost me anything in a
[1:00:15] way
[1:00:22] but I mean when when the Spirit of God
[1:00:25] takes the heart of a man or a woman
[1:00:29] just like dimming in the returning of
[1:00:32] the Ark of the Covenant never even
[1:00:35] consider that he was a king all the
[1:00:39] costs of the Rob that he was wearing he
[1:00:42] put himself before the Lord
[1:00:45] amen and I think that's some other thing
[1:00:48] that have affected the church and people
[1:00:50] cannot even get down on your knees and
[1:00:52] leave their hands because they can't so
[1:00:54] much the cost of the applause
[1:01:00] they just bought it on Saturday for the
[1:01:04] service on Sunday so it's too expensive
[1:01:06] for them to to roll to order to become a
[1:01:11] Holy Roller
[1:01:13] amen glory be to God when the church
[1:01:17] starts becoming more conscious of God
[1:01:20] and more conscious of what is upon the
[1:01:23] word what is coming upon the world
[1:01:26] more conscious of the time that we are
[1:01:29] living in and start losing consciousness
[1:01:33] of our self our pride in our arrogance
[1:01:36] thing I mean people will weep they will
[1:01:40] weep I don't even care if your tears is
[1:01:43] falling on the
[1:01:46] maybe $300 suit or whatever he calls you
[1:01:50] I also thank God I'm not going to tell
[1:01:54] you to my secret places let me go right
[1:01:55] into this message praise the Lord in in
[1:01:58] in so she threw herself right down
[1:02:01] before David
[1:02:04] and
[1:02:06] because
[1:02:08] she was caught
[1:02:10] with the truth nests of heart she was
[1:02:14] really
[1:02:15] interceding she broke into prophecy not
[1:02:18] even roaring
[1:02:20] that's what I want for us to travel a
[1:02:22] little bit
[1:02:25] listen today she says I pray thee
[1:02:29] forgive
[1:02:31] the trespass of the hemming now
[1:02:36] she was not the one that a man came to
[1:02:40] praise the Lord she was not the one that
[1:02:44] the man came to
[1:02:47] they got a message they went straight
[1:02:49] over
[1:02:50] to neighbor and he told him indeed I
[1:02:53] mean he got with David it's another
[1:02:56] breakaway so do
[1:02:58] the assault is looking for you're
[1:03:01] talking from a sheep calling and he sat
[1:03:03] when I read the whole life of David
[1:03:08] and people they do those things today
[1:03:13] as soon as I stop falling away from the
[1:03:16] Word of God or falling away from the
[1:03:18] message that's when they you know they
[1:03:20] the nobler Branham father's life story
[1:03:22] they didn't know you know where he was
[1:03:24] born or in all sorts of things but I'm
[1:03:26] not going there this morning I'm staying
[1:03:28] right here
[1:03:30] she said forgive the trespass of the
[1:03:33] Jemez for the Lord will certainly make
[1:03:37] my lord a shore house thou word a shore
[1:03:41] house it's a prophecy
[1:03:46] that word a shore house is a prophecy
[1:03:50] and that's why we're going to study it a
[1:03:53] little bit a
[1:03:54] shore house
[1:03:57] the first time it was used
[1:04:01] let's go back to you first time here
[1:04:04] chapter 2
[1:04:06] when God has rejected Eli
[1:04:12] now that word that that phrase the shore
[1:04:16] house is
[1:04:17] speaking about the house of mercy
[1:04:22] that was the house dablam bottommost saw
[1:04:25] when he says how much it'll mean there
[1:04:29] are sort of Devi oh
[1:04:31] my goodness I'm beginning to feel so
[1:04:34] good I feel like I can run through a war

[1:04:41] you follow me
[1:04:43] pretty oh

[1:04:53] just you know I just the reason what I
[1:04:56] just love the Word of God I just love
[1:04:59] the Word of God because God has a way
[1:05:02] that he sees things
[1:05:04] you know he sees it he locks it in the
[1:05:08] Covenant you have to get in that
[1:05:10] covenant before you understand it oh
[1:05:13] my first time your chapter 2 let's
[1:05:15] travel back a little bit yeah oh I'm
[1:05:19] feeling so good
[1:05:21] amen amen
[1:05:25] first summit chapter 2 now
[1:05:34] Eli was very old oh I'm going to
[1:05:38] five-year
[1:05:45] okay God is now speaking to Eli here
[1:05:48] verse 27 and there came a man of God on
[1:05:51] to Eli okay so this man of God is now
[1:05:54] telling you know all of the things that
[1:05:56] is going to come upon his house and and
[1:05:58] and what will follow as as you know dad
[1:06:01] just read that and you know steady
[1:06:03] dating and you see the Lord speaking to
[1:06:06] you verse that one behold that they
[1:06:08] commit that I will cut off that arm and
[1:06:14] the arm of your father house you know
[1:06:17] and we saw the death of Eli you know his
[1:06:21] his arm was not literally cut off so
[1:06:23] this is not speaking about cutting off
[1:06:25] his his literal arm but cutting him off
[1:06:28] cut in his house who which mean his sons
[1:06:31] will not continue in the priesthood
[1:06:34] because God was going to establish a new
[1:06:37] order
[1:06:39] amen so if your left hand or fan you cut
[1:06:43] it off don't go and use knife please
[1:06:53] and
[1:06:55] I shall see the enemy thou shalt see an
[1:07:00] enemy in my habitation in all the wealth
[1:07:04] which the law should I give Israel and
[1:07:06] there shall not be an old man in the
[1:07:09] house forever and
[1:07:11] we go in go in alone here
[1:07:14] hope ok yeah I think I'm right
[1:07:19] the scripture says and okay let's look
[1:07:23] at verse 35 that's what I want to get to
[1:07:25] and I will rise up a
[1:07:30] faithful priest I
[1:07:33] will rise up a faithful priest now
[1:07:37] Samuel was not a priest
[1:07:41] Samuel was a seal
[1:07:45] are we together
[1:07:47] samuel was not a priest samuel was a
[1:07:51] seal oh man this thing is becoming so
[1:07:53] good
[1:07:54] but here the man of God is telling Eli
[1:07:57] I'm going to raise up a faithful priests
[1:08:01] - I do a calling to that which is in my
[1:08:07] heart a
[1:08:09] man after God's own heart
[1:08:12] I'm going to raise up a faithful priests
[1:08:17] they will do what is in my heart and my
[1:08:20] mind
[1:08:21] and
[1:08:22] I will build him a show house
[1:08:27] praise the Lord and he shall work before
[1:08:33] mine anointed for ever that's the house
[1:08:36] of David that's the Millennial Kingdom
[1:08:40] that's the house of David that is the
[1:08:43] millennial promise God saying it's
[1:08:47] telling even I would I would cut off
[1:08:48] your arm there is not a one from from
[1:08:51] from from from you your father house is
[1:08:54] going to go along in a priesthood but I
[1:08:56] will raise up one he's going to be a
[1:08:59] faithful priest unto me he's gonna be a
[1:09:02] man after my heart and man I will know
[1:09:04] that we'll be able to grab the touch of
[1:09:07] my mine and
[1:09:10] I'm establishing a priesthood with him
[1:09:14] forever
[1:09:17] glory be to God I would give him a shore
[1:09:21] house now here is Abigail
[1:09:25] yeah
[1:09:27] caught up in a ministry of intercession
[1:09:30] and she truer said before David the
[1:09:34] spirit of the law comes upon her and
[1:09:37] she's prophesying the same thing that
[1:09:40] the man of God says spoke about David
[1:09:42] even before David came to power
[1:09:51] because because she find herself at the
[1:09:56] right place the right time with the
[1:09:58] right attitude
[1:10:03] praise the Lord oh I believe she has
[1:10:07] seen the foolishness of neighbor over
[1:10:09] and over Chico I said children your
[1:10:13] father have done the worst one David the
[1:10:16] man I can't believe yes pack our things
[1:10:18] and leave this house
[1:10:22] Junior where's your shoes
[1:10:24] let's go
[1:10:26] because I'm not dev and his men they
[1:10:28] don't taik nonsense from nobody is that
[1:10:31] why your father she would just Pat the
[1:10:33] children let me go back to my father's
[1:10:34] house
[1:10:36] but she never did that
[1:10:40] her husband never even knew about it she
[1:10:44] never went and make a council with him
[1:10:46] what have you done again and did she
[1:10:49] know that foolishness was in his heart
[1:10:53] quickly Sheik she
[1:10:56] killed some lawmen and make some cakes
[1:10:59] and and and got her some wine and and
[1:11:02] all of those things oh my goodness
[1:11:05] praise the Lord just like those wise men
[1:11:07] coming to worship we have seen the king
[1:11:11] and we have come to worship Him praise
[1:11:14] the Lord
[1:11:15] amen we don't come when we come to
[1:11:19] worship we come to give as as we come to
[1:11:22] receive
[1:11:23] we give our all we give our praise we I
[1:11:26] mean we come to pour ourself so she was
[1:11:29] coming ready ready to appease Devi
[1:11:35] she find herself the right place at the
[1:11:39] right time with the right attitude so
[1:11:42] God had to give her the right words to
[1:11:44] say oh I just loved it my goodness I
[1:11:50] just loved it maybe that's the reason
[1:11:53] why we're not back in our church yet you
[1:11:56] mean praise the Lord I just love that
[1:12:00] Amen God give her the right word to say
[1:12:04] she said I know I prayed it I know the
[1:12:08] Lord will give you a sure house
[1:12:15] praise the Lord
[1:12:18] amen so actually as we traveled alone a
[1:12:21] little bit we will see what this show
[1:12:23] House is because that's what we want to
[1:12:25] dwell on this morning the show house of
[1:12:28] David
[1:12:30] over over the ages it was it was not
[1:12:35] called a show house again in first Kings
[1:12:38] chapter 11 God -
[1:12:45] vs. name now rehab Rome that was not the
[1:12:48] son of David the son of Solomon the the
[1:12:52] captain
[1:12:53] it was really Brahm and
[1:12:57] what is the guy named that's that took
[1:13:00] the ten kingdoms
[1:13:04] jerem yes children children when when
[1:13:08] when when he when he talked and and and
[1:13:10] and and and and the kingdom was splitted
[1:13:13] God told him that if you will work like
[1:13:18] my seven David Walker I
[1:13:21] will give you a shore house
[1:13:26] but the Bible says he did not work
[1:13:30] so we will find out what this shore
[1:13:32] house is but when if you travel through
[1:13:35] the scripture every time like the
[1:13:37] prophet Isaiah he tried to refer back to
[1:13:41] death to their promise of David over the
[1:13:44] years it became the show mercy of David
[1:13:48] so it was not a literal house
[1:13:53] it was little called the show mercy of
[1:13:57] David as I chapter 55 that's right and
[1:14:02] then you will realize also that's show
[1:14:06] mercy of David oh my goodness this scene
[1:14:09] is going to become so sweet it became a
[1:14:13] promise to the Gentiles that's what Paul
[1:14:16] you and myself in
[1:14:18] the show mercy of David they rewrote our
[1:14:23] lives
[1:14:27] it took us from from from from the
[1:14:32] dungeon of scene it took us from
[1:14:34] idolatry and brought us right into the
[1:14:37] cavity of David
[1:14:40] that was the house a shore house it was
[1:14:45] net this this show house of David this
[1:14:49] show mercy of David goes to the
[1:14:51] Millennium
[1:14:53] it goes to the Millennium right in the
[1:14:56] melon air we will still be under the
[1:14:58] mercy and the grace of God oh
[1:15:05] praise Oh
[1:15:09] seiyya 55 let's look at a little bit the
[1:15:11] profit as I had spoke about it and then
[1:15:14] I was sure we would look at something
[1:15:16] again how it came over to the Gentile
[1:15:18] Church
[1:15:25] as I had chapter 55
[1:15:32] praise the Lord
[1:15:37] Isaiah chapter 55 that's where the
[1:15:40] Prophet as I cry out
[1:15:44] with our money with our price
[1:15:48] and
[1:15:50] everlasting coveting
[1:15:56] mine when brother Branham preached a
[1:15:59] message gold rich in mercy oh
[1:16:02] my goodness I don't want to go ahead of
[1:16:05] myself this morning but we would get
[1:16:06] there
[1:16:07] we see how how the show house of David
[1:16:12] the show mercy of David came to you and
[1:16:15] myself as a god that is rich in mercy Oh
[1:16:23] everyone that tests
[1:16:27] come here to the waters and he to have
[1:16:31] no money come here by eat yeah come buy
[1:16:36] wine and milk without money and without
[1:16:40] price
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:45] Wuerffel do you spend money for that
[1:16:49] which is not bread in your labor for
[1:16:53] that which satisfy net ache
[1:16:56] intelligently unto me in it that which
[1:16:59] is good and let your soul delight itself
[1:17:02] in fatness incline your years and come
[1:17:07] on to me hear and your soul shall live
[1:17:11] and I will make an everlasting covenant
[1:17:15] with you even the show mercy of David so
[1:17:19] this come and with our money with our
[1:17:23] we know that that was it was all of
[1:17:26] their Jesus said he deliver and has
[1:17:30] heavy leading he come on to me because
[1:17:34] he was the fulfillment of Isaiah 55
[1:17:39] so through the cross through cavalry now
[1:17:44] we are introduced to the show house of
[1:17:47] David which is the show mercy of David
[1:17:50] oh my oh my goodness me praise the Lord
[1:17:53] as chapter thirteen
[1:18:10] glory be to God
[1:18:25] announced chapter 13
[1:18:35] and announced chapter 13 the senior is
[1:18:40] the other
[1:18:58] praise the Lord we see here
[1:19:02] the
[1:19:08] the bread wins here over in Acts chapter
[1:19:11] 13 we realize there was
[1:19:17] a
[1:19:19] place I'm trying to try to get myself to
[1:19:21] get it a little bit here
[1:19:32] now so we see the Apostle Paul year over
[1:19:37] in this chapter and
[1:19:44] he comes and he meet these people here
[1:19:51] he's going to tell them about
[1:19:55] God's mercy he's going to tell them
[1:19:58] about a new copy and the very thing that
[1:20:00] he fought against to stop and kill those
[1:20:02] a posture and
[1:20:05] the scripture says as
[1:20:08] Paul starts to speak to these people
[1:20:13] and he starts to tell them about David
[1:20:17] the son of Jesse a man after my own
[1:20:22] heart
[1:20:22] we shall fulfill all my will now he goes
[1:20:26] back that is in verse 22 he goes back to
[1:20:30] 1st Samuel chapter 2 the very same thing
[1:20:33] that man of God said to Eli I will raise
[1:20:38] up a priest because we have to
[1:20:40] understand in David's ministry he
[1:20:43] fulfilled the prophet priest and King
[1:20:48] the scriptures say he professor with the
[1:20:51] prophets and being a priest he had a
[1:20:56] right to eat the Shabri
[1:20:58] and he was a king so David in his
[1:21:01] ministry he fulfilled the Prophet
[1:21:04] precinct king so when when that man of
[1:21:07] God was prophesying to to Eli he was not
[1:21:11] talking Samuel you
[1:21:13] know Samuel came as a seal Samuel was
[1:21:17] was was normal among the major prophets
[1:21:23] so we realized here so yeah so here's a
[1:21:27] poor year now and man they have studied
[1:21:31] the Old Testament and seeing what God is
[1:21:34] doing they're opening his eyes to the
[1:21:36] revelation of the hour
[1:21:41] he's speaking here to to these people
[1:21:52] talking about Jesus
[1:21:55] and when he had removed him he's gonna
[1:21:59] gone all the way back remove him he
[1:22:01] raised up unto them
[1:22:04] David to be king to whom also he have
[1:22:09] given a testimony and said I have found
[1:22:12] David the son of Jesse but you see there
[1:22:16] over in in first Kings chapter 2 David
[1:22:18] name was not mentioned but because it
[1:22:20] was fulfilled in David's life now year
[1:22:23] poor Commission David's name
[1:22:26] because it's a man that fulfilled that
[1:22:28] prophecy but when the man of God gave
[1:22:31] the prophecy he never said David he said
[1:22:34] I will raise up a man a faithful priest
[1:22:37] a man after my heart and we know my mind
[1:22:41] but poor seeing that the scripture has
[1:22:45] been fulfilled so he can put David name
[1:22:47] in that place
[1:22:49] praise the Lord it's just like when we
[1:22:52] said Malachi 4 when we say Malachi 4 we
[1:22:55] around the message we know we're talking
[1:22:57] about brother Branham why because we we
[1:22:59] have seen that ministry being fulfilled
[1:23:01] in his ministry there are promise that
[1:23:04] prophecy before I send you Elijah the
[1:23:07] prophet
[1:23:09] are we together
[1:23:12] so as he goes along
[1:23:14] here
[1:23:18] verse 26 men and brethren children of
[1:23:21] the stock of Abraham
[1:23:24] whosoever among you their fear of God to
[1:23:29] you is the word of this salvation
[1:23:32] praise the Lord and he goes on and he
[1:23:35] talks and he talks and he come over a
[1:23:38] year to verse 32 and we declare unto you
[1:23:43] glad tidings how dare the promise which
[1:23:47] was made unto the father's God have
[1:23:52] fulfilled the sin unto us their children
[1:23:55] in that he raised up
[1:23:59] Jesus again as it is also written in the
[1:24:07] second Psalm
[1:24:09] there are my son this day have I
[1:24:12] begotten thee and as concerning that he
[1:24:18] raised him up from the dead now no more
[1:24:22] to return to corruption he said on this
[1:24:25] wine we give you the show mercy of David
[1:24:31] wherefore he said also in another Sam
[1:24:34] there there shall not suffer the Holy
[1:24:38] One to see corruption
[1:24:41] praise the Lord
[1:24:43] there he talks about what David was dead
[1:24:45] David the one I said that but he was
[1:24:48] there but because it was speaking about
[1:24:50] Christ it was tied to the resurrection
[1:24:52] so you see through the resurrection of
[1:24:54] Jesus Christ we have been introduced to
[1:24:58] the show mercy love David that's the
[1:24:59] reason why Paul said if he said if only
[1:25:04] in this life here we are of all men
[1:25:07] miserable there was no resurrection we
[1:25:10] will surely be of all memorable because
[1:25:13] there is there is a lot of benefit that
[1:25:15] comes through the resurrection of Jesus
[1:25:16] Christ to talk to the New Testament
[1:25:19] church now so we see here that this
[1:25:23] promise that God gave spoke about David
[1:25:26] a show house of David which is the show
[1:25:29] mercy of David we see how it has been
[1:25:32] playing but this is where I want to out
[1:25:35] you know I'm trying to just talk him out
[1:25:38] of these things but I'm getting to that
[1:25:39] place how Abigail I
[1:25:43] don't believe she was in the house of
[1:25:46] Eli when that man of God said it
[1:25:50] but honor inspiration because she find
[1:25:55] herself in the right ministry at the
[1:25:57] right time
[1:25:59] she was not a preacher
[1:26:02] because the law of God condemns that
[1:26:06] praise the Lord
[1:26:10] but she had a hot
[1:26:14] she had a heart to be able to present
[1:26:18] herself before God that God would give
[1:26:20] her the right words the right thing to
[1:26:24] say at the right time a
[1:26:27] woman of understanding heart a
[1:26:34] woman of understanding heart is a woman
[1:26:37] whose heart is full of mercy and her
[1:26:40] that is for of vengeance can never be an
[1:26:43] understanding heart
[1:26:45] praise the Lord
[1:26:47] one time David was caught in his own
[1:26:50] guilt and it was troubling him about the
[1:26:54] death of urias and when Nathan came in
[1:26:57] his house he was so nervous until he
[1:26:59] said the man that have done that he must
[1:27:01] die
[1:27:04] why because he was caught up in guilt
[1:27:08] he knew that he had done something
[1:27:10] wrapped Josh Mae was all running through
[1:27:12] his mind so when the heart is filled
[1:27:14] with judgment criticizing and and I mean
[1:27:18] yes you just I mean I mean you can never
[1:27:21] have an understanding heart you can even
[1:27:24] see it things so your own hurt
[1:27:29] you can see it things to your own hurt
[1:27:32] same things so your children on their
[1:27:34] own hurt
[1:27:37] no matter how how backsliding a child
[1:27:41] aged a mother has more always cried for
[1:27:44] mercy and say God have mercy on my boy
[1:27:48] the son of my breasts have mercy
[1:27:52] that's an understanding heart not caught
[1:27:56] up in rage and you can't forgive in your
[1:27:59] job bitter and in order that
[1:28:01] you can never find mercy before God
[1:28:06] that's the bright position I mean we
[1:28:09] this age have so much pressure there is
[1:28:12] just so much pressure or that the weaken
[1:28:16] a gentle spirit that is in the
[1:28:17] atmosphere
[1:28:19] now you yourself sometimes you you make
[1:28:22] yourself angry
[1:28:23] praise the Lord you
[1:28:25] just get so angry why you can't get up
[1:28:28] from bed
[1:28:31] you alone on the bed nobody has talked
[1:28:34] to you just like what you can't wake up
[1:28:35] I
[1:28:37] mean just so much pressure on this age
[1:28:43] if we don't find an understanding heart
[1:28:46] before the Lord
[1:28:49] we will see things to our own hurt
[1:28:54] out of ignorance
[1:28:56] out of thick knowledge and things that
[1:29:01] we know the man of God we know the
[1:29:04] message of we will say things to our own
[1:29:07] hurt and
[1:29:09] that's that's a problem sometimes people
[1:29:12] say things and you realized that is to
[1:29:15] their own hurt and they're not humble
[1:29:17] enough to retrieve those things back and
[1:29:20] see God have mercy
[1:29:24] didn't knew that he said what he said it
[1:29:27] was to his own hurt the man that have
[1:29:28] done that that man should die they don't
[1:29:31] say you are the man David I
[1:29:35] believe the King fell down from his
[1:29:38] strong fear to the feet of the Prophet
[1:29:41] because he knew that he have uses all
[1:29:43] mouth to destroy his house
[1:29:49] but she was a woman of honesty Nihad
[1:29:52] she said have mercy on your handmaid Oh
[1:29:56] David I wish I was I wish I was the one
[1:29:59] that you're me that your boys met how
[1:30:02] much it'll mean
[1:30:06] she took the blame for what she never
[1:30:09] did
[1:30:11] that's the show Mercer of David
[1:30:14] praise the Lord oh
[1:30:17] man
[1:30:19] praise the Lord
[1:30:21] my goodness sometimes it's good to go to
[1:30:24] bed tired
[1:30:27] when you go to bed tired I'm a your
[1:30:30] spirit just feels so free and then I
[1:30:33] mean I was just lying that God you have
[1:30:36] to help me

[1:30:53] position that's the bright place in this
[1:30:56] evil hour
[1:31:01] just a bright place the bride and the
[1:31:04] Spirit see come that's what the
[1:31:06] scripture says
[1:31:07] but you see with all of these things
[1:31:09] that is going on you know God we have to
[1:31:13] bring this bride through everything that
[1:31:15] his were saying there was no shocker for
[1:31:17] the bride
[1:31:19] you know everybody looking at you know
[1:31:22] looking at this
[1:31:25] epidemic to put us in the rapture
[1:31:29] if he put us in a rapture rapture we
[1:31:33] would go
[1:31:34] amen
[1:31:37] but if met this bride will go through
[1:31:40] this and shew again character she would
[1:31:43] get a heart before the Lord
[1:31:47] he had to put us to places that he
[1:31:51] humbled us

[1:31:56] and she said God have mercy on you hear
[1:32:00] me I wish I was the one your boys

[1:32:26] she realized that
[1:32:31] death was approaching her house she got
[1:32:36] on everything quickly
[1:32:39] praise the Lord a
[1:32:42] scripture sees when a man or a woman
[1:32:46] pauses dead who's made is an unbeliever
[1:32:49] when a Bible talks about being warned by
[1:32:53] the conversation verbatim say is their
[1:32:56] behavior it comes right here in the life
[1:32:59] of Abigail
[1:33:04] it comes right here that that believer
[1:33:07] you have to realize what it is the man
[1:33:10] or the woman you youup list you you have
[1:33:13] an opportunity you
[1:33:16] have an opportunity to be a talking to
[1:33:19] that home
[1:33:21] because you know grace has come to you
[1:33:26] grace has come to you you know what the
[1:33:29] word says so you have an opportunity to
[1:33:32] be as a mercy I mean the show mercy to
[1:33:37] that home
[1:33:40] that's what Paul says there he says he
[1:33:43] says their spouse will be will be waned
[1:33:45] by their conversation it's no it's not
[1:33:47] you're picking up the Bible and says no
[1:33:49] the Bible says this the banknote is your
[1:33:52] behavior your attitude
[1:33:57] the way you love your wife and you stay
[1:34:01] respect the Word of God
[1:34:03] the way you love your husband and you
[1:34:06] stayed I mean I keep the commandment of
[1:34:09] the Lord just just in simplicity
[1:34:15] in simplicity
[1:34:18] you love your wife you love your husband
[1:34:21] you love your children and you just be a
[1:34:23] sweet humble Christie
[1:34:26] and by that acted to you by that
[1:34:32] attitude holding mercy in your heart
[1:34:36] not getting angry well yeah yeah yeah
[1:34:39] because you don't read the Bible because
[1:34:40] you don't know no you were just
[1:34:42] completely out of order you yourself you
[1:34:43] need a comforter to rebuff toss you keep
[1:34:46] you under water a little bit
[1:34:49] praise the Lord I
[1:34:54] would together I
[1:34:56] think you grab me what I'm going okay
[1:34:59] that's another thing here in the life of
[1:35:01] a beginner I want for us to pick up I
[1:35:04] get talking and I leave the thing I'm
[1:35:07] supposed to be preaching there's two two
[1:35:10] different things it's supposed to be
[1:35:12] preaching and not talking I
[1:35:14] hope you know when I'm talking okay I'm
[1:35:17] just talking
[1:35:19] Amy I want you to be listening to me
[1:35:22] when I'm preaching now when I'm talking
[1:35:28] praise low let's take Abigail right here
[1:35:30] again the scripture says here
[1:35:34] she came and she spoke did the Bible
[1:35:37] says verse 29
[1:35:39] here
[1:35:43] Abigail state speaking yet a man is
[1:35:47] raising to pursue him and to seek thy
[1:35:50] soul but but the soul of my Lord
[1:35:55] shall be bound in the bundle of life
[1:36:00] verbatim verbal use this statement in
[1:36:03] marriage and their vows when he's talked
[1:36:05] when he spoke about Abigail and and
[1:36:09] it's another prophecy I mean this woman
[1:36:13] that's the reason why
[1:36:16] the Ministry of intercession is the
[1:36:20] greatest ministry it is the greatest
[1:36:23] ministry
[1:36:25] it's the greatest ministry
[1:36:28] the Ministry of intercession is the
[1:36:31] success to every other ministry a
[1:36:35] man can be a preacher if he does not
[1:36:39] have people that are interceding and
[1:36:41] praying he can never be a benefit
[1:36:45] sometimes you look at the preacher and
[1:36:47] you think is the preacher no it's the
[1:36:49] people that are praying the people that
[1:36:51] are saying God you know speak to us
[1:36:54] speak through him the ministry of
[1:36:56] intercession is the greatest ministry
[1:36:59] that's why when a person
[1:37:03] find himself to that place and God hears
[1:37:06] this is prophesying she says a man has
[1:37:09] risen up to seek your life he says but
[1:37:12] the Lord God of our Father
[1:37:15] will wrap you up in a bundle of life the
[1:37:21] bundle of love but Bram used that
[1:37:23] immersion that was when he when he spoke
[1:37:25] of Abigail the bundle of life with the
[1:37:28] law that God and I saw and the soul of
[1:37:34] an enemy and them
[1:37:37] shall be slain out as out of the middle
[1:37:41] of the slain oh my goodness me my middle
[1:37:45] of the slain what she's talking about
[1:37:46] when you went the same way you swing and
[1:37:49] that stone left the middle of the slain
[1:37:50] and and God saw so also the Lord that
[1:37:54] took that stone to the head of Goliath
[1:37:56] he will also take take off the head of
[1:37:59] those that seek your life and it shall
[1:38:02] come to pass when my lord
[1:38:05] sha shall have done all
[1:38:11] when the Lord when the Lord shall have
[1:38:14] done so my lord I call into all the
[1:38:17] goodness that he has spoken concerning
[1:38:20] thee and shall have appointed thee ruler
[1:38:25] over Israel
[1:38:27] that this shall be no grief unto thee no
[1:38:31] no faint of heart unto my lord now
[1:38:36] she'sshe's the Intercity when you when

[1:38:43] house because I know for sure you're
[1:38:46] going to be king over Israel

[1:38:53] thing that is the thing he says he says
[1:38:55] the coming of the Lord rejoice our heart
[1:38:58] you know that's the thing that makes us
[1:39:00] to press on that I mean to hold on and
[1:39:03] in it because we know that surely he's
[1:39:06] going to come as king of kings and Lord
[1:39:08] of lords

[1:39:12] life oh whether we go down by the where
[1:39:16] of the grave we know surely he's coming
[1:39:18] to power
[1:39:20] she knew he was coming to power now you
[1:39:23] and I remember this thing they have come
[1:39:25] from out of my house that this shall be
[1:39:28] no grief on today none of things of
[1:39:31] heart on to my lord either that they'll
[1:39:35] have shared blood costlessly or that my
[1:39:39] lord hath avenged himself but when the
[1:39:44] law shall have their well with my lord
[1:39:47] then remember the Hemi
[1:39:51] amen and
[1:39:53] David said unto me Gill blessed be the
[1:39:57] Lord God of Israel
[1:40:00] we send thee this day to meet me what a
[1:40:04] comfort
[1:40:06] what a comfort all the rage that has
[1:40:09] risen up in David's heart
[1:40:13] may we spin out at night here boys is
[1:40:17] that real what he said are you sure that
[1:40:20] what he said my goodness
[1:40:23] okay
[1:40:24] okay I think he was drunk I would take
[1:40:27] that wine from his eyes
[1:40:29] uh-oh the anger
[1:40:34] when he saw how that woman
[1:40:37] threw herself down and start to cry
[1:40:44] it took all of that away
[1:40:48] it took all the anger away Davis
[1:40:52] appreciating you coming right at the
[1:40:55] right time just
[1:40:56] at the right time
[1:41:00] there was no better time for Esther to
[1:41:03] go in the presence of the king
[1:41:07] because Hema have just he have just
[1:41:10] loaded the gallop
[1:41:12] ready to Hank Molokai on it Eva if
[1:41:17] Esther will have waste time her uncle
[1:41:20] was going to be killed and then the
[1:41:24] blood of the Jews was going to be wasted
[1:41:26] in the city
[1:41:28] so she came in the right time if I would
[1:41:31] die let me die
[1:41:33] administrating of intercession that
[1:41:37] is the brightest ministry
[1:41:41] that is a bright ministry that's what
[1:41:44] barber said in in revelation series
[1:41:46] chapter 4 when he talks about the Troon
[1:41:48] being in the heart that's what we come
[1:41:50] into when he talks about the truth being
[1:41:52] in the heart that's what the bright
[1:41:54] ministry is
[1:41:58] it's a Ministry of intercession
[1:42:06] Ezekiel the angel went down the city
[1:42:09] sealing doors that were weeping why
[1:42:12] intercession they were interceding for
[1:42:15] the evil that is done in a city
[1:42:19] that is the bride ministry that is the
[1:42:23] beauty of the bride in the house of the
[1:42:26] beasts
[1:42:27] because she has an understanding heart
[1:42:30] she has been told about the things in
[1:42:33] politics she has been told about the
[1:42:36] things in in prophecy so she has an
[1:42:39] understanding heart
[1:42:41] you couldn't bring the first age that
[1:42:44] the efficient bride in this age they
[1:42:46] then I had the fullness of the world you
[1:42:48] couldn't even bring the
[1:42:51] the bride I was under the Ox ministry
[1:42:54] you couldn't bring them in it's a
[1:42:55] because people they were anointed I mean
[1:42:57] to give them self to be killed so they
[1:43:01] had a way of challenging Authority
[1:43:04] understand before I told you to
[1:43:06] challenge the authority because I mean
[1:43:08] they were glad to dine
[1:43:12] but this bride is to excel above them
[1:43:16] all to the very heart of God and what is
[1:43:21] the heart of God seeking mercy
[1:43:23] it's seeking mercy
[1:43:28] there are son of David have mercy on me
[1:43:31] there is never a time and may ask for
[1:43:33] mercy that God ever turned his head
[1:43:36] that is a show house of Divi
[1:43:40] no matter how evil a man can be
[1:43:46] when that teeth on the cross they
[1:43:49] remember me
[1:43:52] remember me
[1:43:54] there is never a time a man asks for
[1:43:58] mercy
[1:43:59] if you don't know how to pray just say
[1:44:02] God have mercy on me
[1:44:04] [Laughter]

[1:44:11] going brother scared
[1:44:12] me
[1:44:15] yeah bad mercy is a very heart of God
[1:44:20] the show mercy of David
[1:44:27] that's the beauty of the bride
[1:44:32] the beauty of the bride is not in the
[1:44:35] healing revival
[1:44:38] that's what the care master church and
[1:44:41] Pentecost they all running for it
[1:44:42] everybody trying to make signs that they
[1:44:44] are trying they are hiring people and
[1:44:46] paying them just to discern the beauty
[1:44:48] of the bride is not in that
[1:44:52] the beauty of the bride is not in the
[1:44:54] knowledge of the word it's not how much
[1:44:57] you know the beauty of the bride is how
[1:44:59] much your heart is able to cry before
[1:45:02] God and say have mercy that's the beauty
[1:45:05] of the bride that is the beauty of the
[1:45:08] bride
[1:45:09] that's a tender branch in that day the
[1:45:13] beauty of the brine the branch of the
[1:45:16] bride would be beautiful
[1:45:18] that's the thing that gets to the heart
[1:45:21] of God
[1:45:23] there's a man and a woman
[1:45:25] they say God have mercy on us
[1:45:31] God have mercy on this age have mercy on

[1:46:23] coming to shear blood and from avenging
[1:46:28] myself
[1:46:29] with my own hands for
[1:46:38] him very deed as the Lord God of Israel
[1:46:41] living we have kept me back from hurting
[1:46:45] the set down as he stood and come to
[1:46:49] meet me surely
[1:46:52] there have now been
[1:46:55] one left on to neighbor by the morning
[1:47:00] praise the Lord
[1:47:03] there was something verse 30 says
[1:47:05] something Abigail said in Abigail came
[1:47:10] to never
[1:47:13] know that's that's not what I want to
[1:47:16] get you just read a little okay after
[1:47:19] after the Lord I mean she came to never
[1:47:22] from there and she told her husband all
[1:47:26] that half happy and
[1:47:29] he got a stroke immediately
[1:47:33] he got a stroke the reality hit him you
[1:47:38] know he got a stroke from realizing the
[1:47:41] wrong he realizing what he was bringing
[1:47:43] on himself and he died but after
[1:47:50] never die
[1:47:52] this is what I want to get you to now
[1:47:58] David sent for send his men to go and
[1:48:01] get Abigail to be his wife
[1:48:04] it was it was out of place were
[1:48:07] David
[1:48:09] you know it was just like when Judah
[1:48:15] Tamar has married he sounds he passed to
[1:48:20] the next son he pass and and the owner's
[1:48:25] son he ha was still a young boy
[1:48:29] I call into the trap of Israel unless
[1:48:32] the diary was returned she was returned
[1:48:35] back to her father's house she was
[1:48:37] stayed a wife to the family
[1:48:39] so and and and she wanted to be part of
[1:48:45] this blessing because I believe being
[1:48:47] with the different brothers she heard
[1:48:49] about the blessing the coveting of
[1:48:51] Abraham and
[1:48:52] so the Bible says she Playa Hallett by
[1:48:58] these guys in herself because she wanted
[1:49:01] to take in a seed of Abraham that's what
[1:49:03] Paul used that when he said in
[1:49:05] childbearing she shall be safe
[1:49:08] Paul was referring back to an Old
[1:49:11] Testament type it is not in it's not a
[1:49:14] New Testament for physical fulfillment
[1:49:17] the reason is because the New Testament
[1:49:19] church is going to take in a spiritual
[1:49:21] sea which is the incorruptible seed the
[1:49:23] Word of God so but she disguise herself
[1:49:27] and then after they told Judah your
[1:49:31] daughter-in-law is pregnant he says my
[1:49:33] goodness she played the harlot y'all
[1:49:34] bring her here we gonna stone that woman
[1:49:36] to death and and in all of that and she
[1:49:40] brought out the treasure she said by the
[1:49:42] man
[1:49:43] to have this
[1:49:45] he says something he said Tara thou are
[1:49:50] righteous
[1:49:53] then I the reason why he said that is
[1:49:56] because he realized that
[1:50:00] she uh
[1:50:02] she she caught a revelation she wanted
[1:50:05] to be identified in the coveting
[1:50:09] it is not just because I mean she just
[1:50:13] wanted to be a harlot because you have
[1:50:15] to realize I calling to the scripture
[1:50:18] she you need these guys herself for her
[1:50:20] father-in-law
[1:50:21] she was not just out there for every man
[1:50:24] I was passing by it's because she wanted
[1:50:27] to come honor that coveting she wanted
[1:50:30] to come honor that protection because
[1:50:31] you know if she was not only that
[1:50:33] protection she was vulnerable
[1:50:37] praise the Lord so that it is it is the
[1:50:40] same thing year with David and Abby Gil
[1:50:42] Dimmie has realized and woman was such a
[1:50:46] character that here is him back from
[1:50:50] sharing blocked a
[1:50:51] woman with an honest any heart
[1:50:56] when he heard what
[1:50:59] has happened to never
[1:51:03] he said Wow my goodness I
[1:51:07] think I would just trust the law to
[1:51:09] fight my battle I
[1:51:11] mean because he was not wound up going
[1:51:14] for now but he says everything that
[1:51:16] passes against which me every male in
[1:51:18] the house
[1:51:22] so he was attracted to the character but
[1:51:26] this is this is what I want to I want to
[1:51:28] get us now the scripture says he said
[1:51:31] and after
[1:51:35] Abigail came
[1:51:41] verse 41 the Bible says she arose and by
[1:51:45] herself on her face to the earth and
[1:51:49] said behold ahem may be there 7 to wash
[1:51:54] the feet of the seventh of my Lord
[1:52:00] to wash the feet of the seventh of my
[1:52:05] lord that's what I wanted to grab here
[1:52:07] this morning kind of applause last week
[1:52:10] we were talking about speaking a little
[1:52:12] bit on a message
[1:52:14] doing God a service
[1:52:19] doing God a service what doing God a
[1:52:22] service is
[1:52:24] it's when we wash one another feet
[1:52:29] that's the reason why Jesus took it in
[1:52:32] their little tie before he left
[1:52:35] his church
[1:52:38] and he says what I do on to you now you
[1:52:42] don't know none that nothing about it
[1:52:43] but you know year after
[1:52:46] you call me Lord and Master I wash your
[1:52:49] feet
[1:52:50] don't wash my
[1:52:51] do one onto another
[1:52:54] because that is that is a secret like I
[1:52:58] said last week that is the secret that
[1:53:01] is that that is in this coveting we are
[1:53:05] core to self
[1:53:07] watching watching feet was the highest
[1:53:11] symbol of being a seven
[1:53:15] it was the highest symbol why because
[1:53:18] verbatim said it was the least job
[1:53:22] it was the least job
[1:53:29] so she she's not coming and says well
[1:53:31] you know I'm from a rich man house so I
[1:53:35] want to be the hair wife no
[1:53:37] the Bible says she by her head machine
[1:53:40] come on
[1:53:43] she said I'm not even wanted to be your
[1:53:46] wife I just want to wash the feet of the
[1:53:50] servants of my lord I
[1:53:52] want to be a service to my king
[1:53:59] not just beep riding and dress-up and
[1:54:02] twisting in the Polish no she wanted to
[1:54:05] be see oh my goodness me there are
[1:54:08] things
[1:54:09] they are things that God
[1:54:13] like brother branham said Christ is the
[1:54:15] minister of God revealed he said they
[1:54:17] are things that God put in the Old
[1:54:19] Testament characters they are mistress
[1:54:22] that he put any characters of their
[1:54:25] lives
[1:54:27] they were living their lives but yet
[1:54:30] they were playing out the mixture of God
[1:54:32] the thing from the very heart of God
[1:54:39] and
[1:54:40] that is one of our problems
[1:54:44] the greater move of God
[1:54:48] they have a struck the earth
[1:54:51] God greater than Solomon being displayed
[1:54:55] before us the mystery of God and all of
[1:54:58] these things they had just make a bunch
[1:55:02] of so proud and arrogant and
[1:55:05] when it's like that is just all
[1:55:08] knowledge it had not dropped in your
[1:55:10] heart because when this word drop in
[1:55:12] your heart it has so much weight it will
[1:55:15] put you on your knees when the word
[1:55:17] drops in your heart then Almighty God he
[1:55:21] cannot drop in your heart and use this
[1:55:23] thing when God drop in your heart you
[1:55:25] would get on your knees
[1:55:30] this message
[1:55:33] caught a bride to make her s72 this word
[1:55:38] it was a Ministry of intercession
[1:55:45] with a Ministry of intercession we
[1:55:48] Accord to be seventh I
[1:55:56] mean that's the reason why we can fuss
[1:55:59] that's a reason why I mean we can
[1:56:01] destroy one another that's the reason
[1:56:03] why I mean we can run from pillar to
[1:56:05] post that's the reason why we can do
[1:56:06] everything that we don't because it's
[1:56:08] just all up here
[1:56:11] God drop in your heart you will fall on
[1:56:14] your knees
[1:56:24] that's the position of the bride in this
[1:56:28] age
[1:56:31] the beauty in the house of the beasts
[1:56:36] the beauty that she has is to be able to
[1:56:43] Humble herself before the word is to be
[1:56:46] able to have a heart and look for one to
[1:56:52] self
[1:56:56] praise the Lord
[1:57:00] that was what David saw that was the
[1:57:03] thing that David was attracted to
[1:57:07] that's the thing that he was attracted
[1:57:10] to to see a woman standing in a gap
[1:57:14] keeping his hands from sharing blood
[1:57:18] see the beauty of this read the next
[1:57:21] chapter chapter
[1:57:23] 26
[1:57:25] David is Saul is now exposed to David
[1:57:31] soul is now exposed to David and David
[1:57:35] can kill him David had a right to kill
[1:57:38] him
[1:57:41] but Davey has just been exposed to a
[1:57:46] prophecy that he did not know was
[1:57:48] hanging over him
[1:57:51] the show mercy of David he's a fire
[1:57:55] beard
[1:57:58] then I put my hands on the Lord's
[1:58:01] anointed
[1:58:02] he had just been exposed to a prophecy
[1:58:06] that he did not know was hanging over
[1:58:08] his head
[1:58:11] let me read some few things here before
[1:58:15] because I can go like this then if you
[1:58:17] don't stop me it's all night prayer
[1:58:19] meeting Amy
[1:58:21] because when I leave from me I'm just
[1:58:23] going to crash
[1:58:25] gonna be the god
[1:58:28] he mean
[1:58:30] problem says this he said
[1:58:44] he said
[1:58:49] relationship to fall is his yeah he says
[1:58:52] now he says now is the day of mercy
[1:58:58] now let's go back to the Old Testament
[1:59:00] years just a little bit and find out
[1:59:03] what mercy is
[1:59:05] go on back and see what happened on this
[1:59:10] truth destroy the throne of judgment the
[1:59:14] reason today that there is mercy is
[1:59:17] because the mercy seat is sprinker wave
[1:59:22] and a to me blood as he says and as long
[1:59:27] as blood is on the the mercy seat then
[1:59:33] it is net Josh Mahnomen it's mercy
[1:59:37] because something died - still Josh mean
[1:59:42] something died - still judgment and
[1:59:45] that's what that's what I be guilty she
[1:59:49] died to her prime
[1:59:52] she died to her beauty to hold judgment
[1:59:56] to halt the wrath of God from her house
[1:59:59] something died to steal judgment you see
[2:00:03] it amen he says as long as blood is on
[2:00:07] the mercy seat it shows there something
[2:00:11] died to hold judgment back
[2:00:13] but when the churches rapture the mercy
[2:00:17] seat becomes a judgment seat
[2:00:21] amen he said the church in his condition
[2:00:25] now this is direct directed by the Holy
[2:00:29] Ghost you are forgiving and have no
[2:00:33] enemies living pass above the
[2:00:35] condemnation of sinners you don't live
[2:00:38] like the headings you live different
[2:00:42] your your life is
[2:00:44] its part and different the gentle Holies
[2:00:48] very sitting on the throne of your heart
[2:00:51] making you live peaceful and quiet and
[2:00:55] loving around all people your neighbors
[2:00:59] in all he sees in and in all your
[2:01:01] associate knows that you are a gentle
[2:01:05] quiet meek humble Christian the door of
[2:01:07] God is with you
[2:01:11] praise the Lord
[2:01:14] the infallibility of the proof of of the
[2:01:18] resurrection
[2:01:20] he says the same that the same question
[2:01:23] said to when the Holy Spirit comes into
[2:01:27] the hema heart
[2:01:29] the same question is settled
[2:01:34] praise the Lord when that is the reason
[2:01:37] why the Holy Ghost bring us an
[2:01:40] understanding heart
[2:01:45] Norbert Branham said he says
[2:01:50] when he when he talks on Paul prophecy
[2:01:53] when Paul said now we know in part
[2:01:57] when that wish is perfect will come well
[2:02:01] he said that which is perfect is the
[2:02:04] perfect understanding
[2:02:05] that that wish is perfect the perfect
[2:02:09] understanding
[2:02:11] for us to rightly apply the word that's
[2:02:15] God's perfection perfect understanding
[2:02:17] and that's what Abigail had perfect
[2:02:22] understanding
[2:02:24] that wish is perfect
[2:02:28] when they shall come that wishes in part
[2:02:31] will be done away with
[2:02:35] praise the Lord
[2:02:38] perfect understanding you know when when
[2:02:41] the Holy Ghost comes into the human hand
[2:02:43] is set to the same question why I mean
[2:02:47] it
[2:02:49] helps us to understand what God is doing
[2:02:52] in our lives you know when things is
[2:02:56] repeating in our lives it's not a way to
[2:02:59] condemn our sin and well I think I need
[2:03:02] to be rebaptised again well I think I
[2:03:04] need to go to the altar to pray for the
[2:03:06] Holy Ghost again it's because God is
[2:03:09] waving something before you he's trying
[2:03:11] to get your attention he's trying to
[2:03:14] teach you
[2:03:15] perfect understanding
[2:03:21] we are not blindly shooting God is
[2:03:24] teaching us he's dealing with our hearts
[2:03:27] he's teaching us we can be able to see
[2:03:30] things in our lives
[2:03:33] and he put those things there for the
[2:03:37] reason he's teaching every one of us
[2:03:42] he says it casts down reasoning
[2:03:47] it cast down reasoning when the Holy
[2:03:50] Ghost comes into the human heart it goes
[2:03:53] above our intellectual effect not as
[2:03:56] splitting away everything when a person
[2:03:58] can explain away everything has a reason
[2:04:01] for everything and every little thing
[2:04:03] they tried to make a spiritual
[2:04:08] so they can build himself out
[2:04:11] they quickly get to their phone and find
[2:04:14] a few coats where brother branham said
[2:04:15] this and that and it in here they see
[2:04:19] two coats where he says this and they
[2:04:21] never ready 20 of where he speaks
[2:04:22] against that
[2:04:26] it goes beyond intellectual faith when
[2:04:30] the Holy Ghost comes into the human
[2:04:32] heart
[2:04:33] now today the reason so many ups and
[2:04:36] downs and teens
[2:04:39] enter the religious people because
[2:04:42] there's an intellectual conception we
[2:04:46] have in so much knowledge
[2:04:49] we need an honest any heart to apply
[2:04:53] wisdom to our knowledge
[2:04:57] we're having so much knowledge that's
[2:05:00] what this world has brought us we have
[2:05:03] to be grateful
[2:05:04] we have to be grateful you don't find
[2:05:07] those languages
[2:05:09] in other groups on an important is just
[2:05:13] a technology I mean technology in a
[2:05:17] message on importance is a demonstration
[2:05:22] where bamse went to unimportant meets he
[2:05:27] says the Murray clears manifest said
[2:05:29] it's a demonstration in other groups is
[2:05:32] just a terminology he's an unimportant
[2:05:34] God he's an only seeing God but but by
[2:05:38] the message of the our brother banner
[2:05:40] has brought us an understanding what it
[2:05:42] is
[2:05:44] he says he's an only present God because
[2:05:47] he's on his hands he's everywhere
[2:05:50] because he knows everything so we have
[2:05:54] all of those we have those information
[2:05:58] but we need to apply our heart to wisdom
[2:06:02] that's the place that we are missing it
[2:06:05] you know what Paul says he says our
[2:06:09] wisdom is Jesus Christ
[2:06:13] praise the Lord that's what he said our
[2:06:16] wisdom is Jesus Christ let me finish
[2:06:19] reading I will show that to you in the
[2:06:21] scripture he says and today the reason
[2:06:23] so many ups and downs and things I enter
[2:06:27] the religious people because there is an
[2:06:29] intellectual conception of cry in other
[2:06:31] words it is India mind and not the heart
[2:06:40] they just mentally believe it they can
[2:06:43] call it like machine-gun and
[2:06:49] young Annie and your mentor were reason
[2:06:53] may be so could divine healing be so
[2:06:56] good about the sin of the Holy Ghost
[2:06:58] that's all of those things that create
[2:07:00] question in the hearts of the believers
[2:07:03] well because we did that you don't have
[2:07:06] the Holy Ghost
[2:07:07] and because this president well if he
[2:07:11] ever did that's why he did he don't have
[2:07:13] the Holy Ghost I mean we just quick to
[2:07:15] fire out
[2:07:17] he say things that was not supposed to
[2:07:21] be saying verbatim says that's what
[2:07:24] inter lateral reasoning he says that's
[2:07:27] intellectual reasoning but when when
[2:07:29] that comes into your heart it's a faith
[2:07:33] it is positive there is no question at
[2:07:38] all about it is all settled forever it's
[2:07:43] in your heart in your heart doesn't
[2:07:46] reason because it is the truth the
[2:07:50] dwelling place of the almighty God is in
[2:07:54] your heart
[2:07:56] the dwelling place of the almighty God
[2:07:59] is in your heart
[2:08:03] praise the Lord love the Lord is
[2:08:06] afternoon oh
[2:08:08] my goodness me what a wonderful Jesus
[2:08:13] we serve
[2:08:15] praise the Lord
[2:08:28] first Corinthian first one Teddy that's
[2:08:32] just reading with close first
[2:08:35] Corinthians chapter 1
[2:08:50] verse 27 he says but God has chosen the
[2:08:53] foolish things of this world to confound
[2:08:55] the wise and God has chosen the weak
[2:08:58] things of this world to confound the
[2:09:00] things that are mighty the best things
[2:09:02] of this word and the things which I
[2:09:06] despise go has choosen ya the things
[2:09:08] which are
[2:09:11] not to bring to nought things that are
[2:09:14] no flesh should glory in his presence
[2:09:17] but of him are
[2:09:20] ye in Christ Jesus
[2:09:22] who is God
[2:09:27] who of God is made unto us wisdom
[2:09:34] Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us
[2:09:38] wisdom there Luke testifying he says he
[2:09:44] grew in stature
[2:09:47] right in Luke chapter two talking about
[2:09:50] the growth of Jesus how he grew in
[2:09:53] stature before man and before God so
[2:09:57] what is Paul saying here he's saying
[2:09:59] that even the Bible say he learned
[2:10:02] obedience the many things he suffered so
[2:10:06] wisdom was hid in his life even from
[2:10:09] growing up the life of Jesus wisdom was
[2:10:13] hid in it it's a will for us it's may
[2:10:17] wisdom
[2:10:19] that we can grow in stature
[2:10:23] before men and before God we can learn
[2:10:26] in obedience by the many things that we
[2:10:29] suffer those were the things that were
[2:10:31] hidden in Jesus life
[2:10:33] Almighty God learning obedience why
[2:10:36] because he was wisdom wisdom learned

[2:16:24] [Music]
[2:16:47] [Music]
[2:17:07] [Music]
[2:17:10] I
[2:17:21] just imagined Abigail singing the song
[2:17:26] she comes to the house of David
[2:17:30] realizing that she would have been dead
[2:17:33] if God
[2:17:37] now by mercy
[2:17:40] how hard to make the right decision
[2:17:45] [Music]
[2:17:47] I see Abigail with her bucket go into
[2:17:50] the well and she's thinking about it
[2:18:01] that God took me from the house of a
[2:18:04] fool
[2:18:07] and he brought me to the house of one
[2:18:11] that is going to be king
[2:18:15] she had to suffer with Davey in his
[2:18:19] trial
[2:18:20] she had to hide with Davey in the rocks
[2:18:23] she had to run with Davey but in her
[2:18:26] heart she knows
[2:18:28] that she will be sitting on the throne
[2:18:30] one of these days
[2:18:34] you
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:40] and that's the same word god
[2:18:46] as taking us from out of an age
[2:18:49] that it's miserable and retching
[2:18:53] there is that is blind and naked
[2:18:59] he has caught us out
[2:19:02] to bear the reproach of Jesus Christ
[2:19:07] to bear the reproach
[2:19:12] sometimes we don't want nothing nothing
[2:19:14] nothing wrong to be said
[2:19:17] about our lives we try to polish up I
[2:19:22] will buy behaviors I would testimony and
[2:19:26] she just be all written beautiful
[2:19:29] but bearing the reproach of Jesus Christ
[2:19:32] is admitting that God took me from out
[2:19:35] of my foolishness he delivered me from
[2:19:37] the spirit and he delivered me from this
[2:19:39] habit is admitting that
[2:19:44] my heart was filled with lust and anger
[2:19:47] but God in His mercy
[2:19:52] [Music]
[2:19:53] if your life was alright then there was
[2:19:56] nothing to be rewrote
[2:19:59] well mercy rewrote your life then there
[2:20:02] was something that was not right
[2:20:07] as you have falling
[2:20:11] my soul I will choose
[2:20:15] yes Lord
[2:20:18] yes Lord Jesus oh
[2:20:22] I tell you this afternoon when God
[2:20:26] dropped in your heart you will fall to
[2:20:29] your knees

[2:20:35] your heart the juice would come out of
[2:20:37] your eyes

[2:20:51] you lord
[2:20:53] thank you Father
[2:20:59] thank you for your mercy Jesus
[2:21:04] [Music]
[2:21:10] father we all realize sometimes in our
[2:21:13] lives we were foolish from all
[2:21:16] we were foolish law with the things that
