[42:46] Jesus you the center of my
[42:53] joy what the musician softly play I want
[42:56] to read this uh brother Brandon said in
[42:58] the message a way to have
[43:03] Fellowship praise the Lord I was just
[43:08] uh listening to
[43:13] uh that message and he said this it was
[43:17] such a blessing to me I want us to read
[43:19] that before we go into what we want to
[43:21] share
[43:23] tonight but Bram said I would rather
[43:25] have a
[43:27] church that knows nothing about any
[43:31] spiritual
[43:33] [Music]
[43:36] gift I would rather have a church that
[43:38] knows nothing about any spiritual gift
[43:43] and just be so in
[43:46] love with each other and with
[43:52] Christ I did rather have that than every
[43:56] spiritual
[43:58] gift operating in the
[44:01] church now that might sound hard in a
[44:05] Pentecostal
[44:07] group but I would rather have
[44:11] it where there is gift they will
[44:14] fill where there is gift they will bring
[44:20] confusion where there is gifts they can
[44:23] be
[44:25] questioned but where there is
[44:28] love it is
[44:31] perfect that's
[44:34] right and if you had perfect love you
[44:39] did have perfect
[44:41] gift that's
[44:44] right so work first with
[44:50] love that brings
[44:52] fellowship and fellowship brings gift
[44:58] Paul said in the book of Corinthian I
[45:00] will show you a most excellent way he
[45:04] was speaking about gifts and he says let
[45:07] me show you the most excellent way that
[45:10] is the last verse in the 1 Corinthians
[45:13] chapter
[45:14] 12 and then he goes into chapter 13
[45:17] which is the love chapter so the most
[45:21] excellent way for every gift the
[45:23] foundation is love amen if you love God
[45:28] you will never struggle when your gift
[45:30] comes on a
[45:31] question if you love God you will never
[45:35] struggle you will never have
[45:38] complex of uh manifestation of gifts or
[45:43] something like that no that's why
[45:45] brother brandham say he said first start
[45:47] with love first work with
[45:51] love praise the Lord can we bow our
[45:55] heads together
[45:56] tonight and just pray that the love of
[45:59] God will be our
[46:02] portion May the love of God be a portion
[46:06] to this
[46:08] church I would rather have a church that
[46:11] knows nothing about spiritual
[46:13] gift and that is just so in love with
[46:17] each
[46:18] other and with Christ in love with the
[46:24] word in love
[46:26] love with the word in love with the
[46:29] message in love with Christ I would
[46:31] rather have that than every spiritual
[46:33] gift operating in the
[46:35] church now that my sound hard for the
[46:38] Pentecostal group but I would rather
[46:40] have it where there is love it will fail
[46:44] where there is love it will bring
[46:45] confusion I mean where there is gift
[46:47] sorry where there is gift they will fail
[46:51] where there is gift they will bring
[46:53] confusion where there is gift they can
[46:56] be questioned but where there is love it
[47:01] is perfect that's right and if you have
[47:05] you have perfect love you did have
[47:08] perfect gifts that's right so work first
[47:11] with love that brings fellowship and
[47:14] fellowship brings gift let's pray
[47:16] together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus upon
[47:20] this word we want to approach the
[47:22] service tonight oh God our Father you
[47:25] will just come oh Lord God and Eng grace
[47:27] us with the love like Paul says the love
[47:30] of God spread about in our hearts by the

[47:37] love of God father I pray tonight oh God

[51:04] surely they will turn away your heart
[51:07] after their gods Solomon cleave unto
[51:12] this in
[51:14] love and he had 700 wives princesses and
[51:20] 300
[51:21] concubines and his wives turned away
[51:26] his
[51:27] heart for it came to pass when Solomon
[51:30] was old that his wives turned away his
[51:32] heart after other gods and his heart was

[52:13] Matthew chapter
[52:17] 6 Matthew chapter
[52:22] six like I said we want to we want to uh
[52:25] continue on our talk Solomon in all of
[52:28] his
[52:41] glory praise the
[52:44] Lord
[52:46] amen Matthew chapter 6 verse
[52:54] 28
[52:58] and why take he thought of raymen
[53:00] consider the ladies of the field how
[53:03] they
[53:04] grow how they grow they told that
[53:07] neither do they neither do they spend
[53:10] and yet I said unto you that even
[53:13] Solomon in all his glory was not array
[53:17] like one of these praise the Lord amen
[53:22] we look at Solomon Glory we look at the
[53:25] glory of the temple we look at the glory
[53:28] of his throne and uh uh the amount of
[53:31] wealth he was sitting in and gold and
[53:35] and precious stones we we we we look at
[53:38] the glory of his uh herses and the food
[53:42] that he ate we look at the glory of his
[53:45] wisdom tonight we want to look at the
[53:47] glory of his
[53:50] wives Solomon in all of his glory praise
[53:54] the Lord
[53:55] amen before before we start there
[53:57] tonight identify Masterpiece brother
[53:59] brandham said and I want to
[54:02] read uh on our
[54:05] subject before we read that tonight uh
[54:08] uh did you appreciate the message on
[54:10] Sunday Amen in the presence of in in in
[54:14] his presence praise the Lord I think
[54:16] that was the title in his presence amen
[54:18] you appreciate the message we thank
[54:20] brother William for that let's give the
[54:21] Lord a hand of Praise
[54:24] amen
[54:27] you know the reason why is that uh uh
[54:30] the the the the house of God and and the
[54:32] preaching of the Gospel is a kind of a
[54:34] supernatural thing and I believe that
[54:37] every service build a foundation for the
[54:40] next service praise the Lord amen
[54:43] because brother William said something
[54:44] on Sunday he and myself we were just
[54:46] fellowshipping on that and I told him
[54:48] I'm going to stand on that tonight to
[54:50] preach amen amen so uh uh we were just
[54:54] Fellowship shipping on that and and uh
[54:57] uh uh I really didn't have much much
[55:00] time to spend with him so I went to pick
[55:02] him up directly from
[55:05] work and took him home to go and get
[55:08] ready praise the
[55:12] Lord so brother Bram says here in
[55:15] identified Masterpiece I will have to go
[55:17] faster just to be able to keep up with
[55:19] the time
[55:20] tonight and uh uh I hope uh I don't want
[55:23] to keep you I don't want to keep you
[55:25] long I hope nothing will make me keep
[55:28] you long praise the Lord and uh hope it
[55:31] will not be a vain promise
[55:34] to brother Bram says Jesus said one time
[55:39] consider the
[55:41] ladies and yet I said unto you that
[55:44] Solomon in all of his glory was not a
[55:48] raay like one Solomon in all of his
[55:53] glory was was a magnificent sight
[55:57] there's no doubt he was a great thing to
[56:02] the word and a great man before God the
[56:07] man that God will says I will give you
[56:10] wisdom that no man before you have ever
[56:14] had or no man after you so if Jesus will
[56:17] say he's greater than Solomon than Jesus
[56:20] Is God
[56:21] Amen praise the Lord that's what one of
[56:25] the scriptural proof that Jesus is God
[56:27] or else God will be breaking his word
[56:29] because he said there would be no man
[56:32] that will have such a wisdom there was
[56:34] no man before you there will be no man
[56:36] after you so it has to be almighty God
[56:39] in flesh
[56:41] amen he was a great man he was a great
[56:44] thing to the word and a great man before
[56:46] God but Solomon Rob they didn't have no
[56:52] life in
[56:53] it it was a piece of
[56:59] material probably sh off of a sheep
[57:04] back praise the Lord so you see where
[57:07] brother bham is holding this this
[57:09] balance that we've been looking at
[57:11] through the scripture and through the
[57:13] different
[57:14] courts Jesus himself is the one that is
[57:18] bringing Solomon into
[57:21] reverence he's referring to Solomon and
[57:24] saying there Solomon in all of his
[57:28] glory in all of his glory not part of
[57:32] his glory in all of his glory so Solomon
[57:35] Glory was in as much as it was an
[57:39] attraction to the eyes in as much as uh
[57:43] uh uh it was mind bluring to the minds
[57:46] of the people the glory of his wisdom
[57:49] the glory of the Tabernacle everything
[57:51] was in order that he pleased God that
[57:54] the the shakana glory came and and hang
[57:57] in the in the temple of Solomon in all
[58:00] of the
[58:02] glory Jesus
[58:05] said it was
[58:08] temporary it was a glory that could be
[58:11] fed away the Bible talk about in The
[58:14] Book of Corinthian the glory of Moses
[58:17] Moses have such a glory that that the
[58:20] people couldn't even look at his
[58:22] face amen
[58:27] and yet Paul Paul was the one that de
[58:30] with Moses Glory Jesus is dealing with
[58:32] Solomon Glory but Paul in the book of
[58:35] Corinthian help us to see that even
[58:37] though Moses came down from the mountain
[58:40] and the people could see the brightness
[58:42] of his
[58:43] face but yet Paul make us to understand
[58:47] that that was a glory that pass
[58:51] away
[58:53] amen it was a temp temporary
[58:55] Glory it faded
[58:59] away which of course also he was
[59:02] bringing to the church that we are
[59:04] having interal
[59:09] Glory praise the Lord you know the way
[59:12] he said it he said it thatth you are
[59:15] having internal weight of
[59:21] Glory you love the Lord amen amen
[59:26] praise the
[59:27] Lord what a
[59:30] wonderful wonderful Jesus we
[59:40] Ser let's look at 2 Corinthians
[59:45] 4:17 let's look at 2 Corinthians
[59:49] 4:17 a little bit
[59:53] yeah
[1:00:12] you go back he talks he talking about
[1:00:16] our our trial he talking about the
[1:00:18] different things that we go through but
[1:00:20] he brought it in a very beautiful way
[1:00:22] here that's what I want us to see
[1:00:25] because you you'll be able to understand
[1:00:28] here praise the
[1:00:30] Lord 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:00:48] 4 let's let's read from verse 10 it will
[1:00:50] give us a little background year always
[1:00:53] bearing about in the body in our body
[1:00:56] the dying of the Lord Jesus that the
[1:00:59] life also of Jesus might be made
[1:01:02] manifest in our body for we which are
[1:01:06] alive are always delivered onto death
[1:01:09] for Jesus
[1:01:11] sake that the life also of Jesus might
[1:01:16] be might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:01:20] flesh so then death WTH in us but life
[1:01:24] in
[1:01:25] you we having the same Spirit of Faith
[1:01:29] ACC calling as it is written I believe
[1:01:31] therefore I have
[1:01:32] spoken we also believe and therefore we
[1:01:36] speak knowing that he which raise up the
[1:01:41] Lord Jesus shall
[1:01:43] raise up us also by Jesus and shall
[1:01:47] present us with you for all things are
[1:01:52] for your sake that the abundant grace
[1:01:56] might through the
[1:01:58] Thanksgiving of
[1:02:01] many uh redone to the glory of God for
[1:02:06] which cause we faint net but though our
[1:02:09] outward men
[1:02:12] perish yet the inward men is renewed day
[1:02:16] by day praise the Lord and as we studed
[1:02:20] the Temple of Solomon the outside of the
[1:02:23] temple was made with water what we can
[1:02:27] remember the outside of the
[1:02:29] temple which material which mineral was
[1:02:32] he M
[1:02:34] with praise the lord we can
[1:02:40] remember
[1:02:44] BR the outside of the temple was made
[1:02:46] with BR the inside was made with
[1:02:51] gold that was what we saw it in the
[1:02:53] scripture
[1:02:55] the outside of the temple was made with
[1:02:57] Brides because Brides represent judgment
[1:02:59] so Paul is bringing the same thing here
[1:03:02] ourly we perish we go through lot of
[1:03:06] things we go through lot of Trials
[1:03:10] hourly for for an in of
[1:03:14] Glory so the the even the physical
[1:03:17] Temple of Solomon the material that was
[1:03:20] inside the temple had more weight than
[1:03:23] the one that was
[1:03:25] outside are we
[1:03:27] together praise the
[1:03:30] Lord so he says uh uh for which cause we
[1:03:34] Fe that but though our outward men
[1:03:38] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[1:03:41] by day for our light
[1:03:45] afflictions praise the Lord Paul is
[1:03:47] saying no matter what you are going
[1:03:50] through it's
[1:03:52] light when it get on the skill of God is
[1:03:58] light no matter what you are going
[1:04:01] through no matter what job went through
[1:04:04] no matter what every man born of a woman
[1:04:07] will go through he says it's a light
[1:04:11] Affliction for our light Affliction
[1:04:14] which is but for a moment is
[1:04:18] temporary work for us a far more
[1:04:23] exceeding
[1:04:24] an internal weight of Glory so on on the
[1:04:30] skill of God your your your trials is
[1:04:35] here your internal weight
[1:04:39] outweighted that's why it looks like
[1:04:41] your trial is high up I'm just being
[1:04:44] tried it's because your internal weight
[1:04:47] it has your your internal Glory has more
[1:04:52] weight praise the Lord amen amen if you
[1:04:56] put two things on the scale the one that
[1:04:59] have more weight will go down the one
[1:05:02] that is light will fly up that's why
[1:05:05] your trials are flying all over the
[1:05:08] place because they are
[1:05:11] [Laughter]
[1:05:13] light amen and the internal Glory that
[1:05:17] is waiting for you have more weight is
[1:05:20] solid it will never pass away it will
[1:05:23] never fill
[1:05:25] out praise the
[1:05:28] Lord
[1:05:30] amen our light reflection don't never
[1:05:34] forget about this verse write it in the
[1:05:36] back of your
[1:05:38] mind no matter what you're going through
[1:05:40] is
[1:05:42] light
[1:05:44] amen the reason why it's springing up is
[1:05:46] is like is swallowing you is like it's
[1:05:48] overcoming you is because it's
[1:05:52] light praise the Lord
[1:05:55] your internal Glory has more
[1:05:58] weight praise the
[1:06:04] Lord while we look not at the things
[1:06:08] which are seen but are the things which
[1:06:11] are not seen for the things which are
[1:06:14] seen are temporary Solomon Glory could
[1:06:17] be
[1:06:19] seen it was
[1:06:22] temporary the glory that was on Moses
[1:06:25] face could be
[1:06:27] seen the people could see the brightness
[1:06:30] that they couldn't even look at his
[1:06:32] face it was
[1:06:34] temporary that is the emphasis that
[1:06:38] Jesus was bringing in comparing Solomon
[1:06:41] with the
[1:06:44] lady is that one one Glory was temporary
[1:06:49] it captured the whole
[1:06:52] word everybody that came around saw and
[1:06:55] said
[1:06:57] wow what a wisdom what a tabernacle what
[1:07:01] a
[1:07:03] temple the worst part of
[1:07:06] it they say the worst or the better I
[1:07:08] don't know which
[1:07:11] one and yet he had 10,000 women around
[1:07:16] him is it West or
[1:07:18] better oh you go home and and judge
[1:07:21] judge that one
[1:07:22] yourself
[1:07:24] praise the Lord but it was all
[1:07:30] temporary temporary in the sense that it
[1:07:33] was a type God allowed it because it was
[1:07:37] speaking of something

[1:08:08] Bram said here he says uh his
[1:08:11] uh Solomon Rob didn't have no life in it
[1:08:16] a piece of material probably shared off
[1:08:19] of the the Sheep back but the lady had
[1:08:22] life what we need today is the Life of
[1:08:27] Christ inside of
[1:08:30] us now what is outside amen it's
[1:08:35] inside the trials are all outside the
[1:08:38] outside of our Tabernacle is made with
[1:08:41] Brides because Brides can stand
[1:08:44] fire Brides represent judgment right
[1:08:48] that's what our body go through
[1:08:50] different trials and different things
[1:08:53] there outside of the Tabernacle is made
[1:08:56] for brides this body brother bam said we
[1:08:58] we B pass our T so we can be tempted so
[1:09:03] we can be tried and while we are tried
[1:09:06] on the outside the inside the internal
[1:09:10] Glory the inside character of Christ is
[1:09:14] being built inside of Us Praise the Lord
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:22] hallelujah are we together
[1:09:26] amen so let's run through
[1:09:30] that but the lady her life what we need
[1:09:34] today is the Life of Christ inside of
[1:09:36] us that's what purify not the
[1:09:41] outside to turn around colge or a degree
[1:09:45] of uh psychology or something it takes
[1:09:49] the power of the resur of the
[1:09:51] resurrected Christ to make us what we
[1:09:54] should be
[1:09:56] amen God has no other plan than let the
[1:10:02] Holy Ghost Rule and reign in the
[1:10:06] church and what did Jesus said the Holy
[1:10:10] Ghost is in
[1:10:12] you amen the Holy Ghost is in you there
[1:10:17] is no other Glory that is more powerful
[1:10:22] than almighty God
[1:10:24] tabernacling in you praise the Lord you
[1:10:28] can go through your mind battles and go
[1:10:31] through all the Temptation and sensation
[1:10:33] of your
[1:10:34] flesh but you know by faith that there
[1:10:38] is God in your
[1:10:40] heart praise the Lord amen sometimes we
[1:10:44] go through all of these trials and
[1:10:47] temptations and you know and and
[1:10:49] sometimes you feel so filthy to
[1:10:52] yourself pray praise the
[1:10:55] Lord and you don't even want to believe
[1:10:57] that you have the Holy
[1:10:59] Ghost you don't even want to believe
[1:11:02] that that God is in you but you see the
[1:11:05] the reason why is
[1:11:09] because you have not seen the beauty of
[1:11:12] the inside of the
[1:11:15] Tabernacle praise the
[1:11:18] Lord
[1:11:20] amen when Israel set set up the T the
[1:11:23] Tabernacle uh on
[1:11:27] Moses the Ark of the Covenant was in the
[1:11:30] holiest of holy but there were days
[1:11:32] where storm came and and and a Hil
[1:11:36] hailstones came down and snow came down
[1:11:39] and and whatever came down it did not
[1:11:42] defy what was
[1:11:44] inside the holiest of holy right praise
[1:11:48] the Lord so Jesus is bringing us to the
[1:11:51] place for us to realize
[1:11:55] realize and
[1:11:58] appreciate don't
[1:12:00] Define what he's doing in You by what
[1:12:03] happening around
[1:12:06] you because what is happening in you is
[1:12:09] more Glory interal
[1:12:12] Glory he's building character in
[1:12:15] you he's giving giving your soul a
[1:12:18] thirst for Living
[1:12:20] Water praise the Lord yes sir
[1:12:25] As the deer panted for the water Brocks
[1:12:28] are we
[1:12:29] together
[1:12:32] amen so he said that's what purify not
[1:12:35] the
[1:12:36] outside he says it takes the power of
[1:12:39] the Resurrect The resurrected Christ to
[1:12:42] make
[1:12:43] us what we should be God has no other
[1:12:48] plan than to let the Holy Spirit Rule
[1:12:51] and reign in the church are we
[1:12:55] together now so we want to look at
[1:12:57] Solomon Solomon Glory of many wives
[1:13:01] That's Another other Glory he gave
[1:13:03] himself took on a glory of 700 wives and
[1:13:08] 300 Cony bounds praise the Lord now you
[1:13:12] see that's how God in his great
[1:13:17] wisdom men in their fallen State you
[1:13:20] look at their the the the dire thought
[1:13:23] of a man would just go to
[1:13:26] filthiness that's that's the first thing
[1:13:28] he would think in his mind he would
[1:13:30] think about filth sex 700 w
[1:13:36] wow why would God allow the son of
[1:13:42] David the one that he
[1:13:44] gives an
[1:13:46] experience of the
[1:13:49] Millennium because Solomon Reign was a
[1:13:51] type of the Millennium why will God
[1:13:54] allow
[1:13:55] that that shows how his mind is bigger
[1:13:59] than our
[1:14:02] mind why would go allow it not felt not
[1:14:07] sex that is something that is SE
[1:14:09] introduced that was not God original
[1:14:12] plan from the
[1:14:15] beginning praise the
[1:14:18] Lord so what pleasure do God have in
[1:14:21] that but why he allow
[1:14:26] it and to realize that all of those
[1:14:29] things were a mystery that were heal in
[1:14:32] the
[1:14:33] seals that was kept for this day to be
[1:14:38] revealed praise the
[1:14:47] Lord and i' I mean I've looked through
[1:14:50] different different commentaries I've
[1:14:52] really never saw anyone bringing it out
[1:14:55] like the way brother Bram said in
[1:14:57] marriage and
[1:14:59] divorce he says here marriage and
[1:15:01] divorce let's take that a little bit
[1:15:03] here he says now look in the final an
[1:15:08] analysis look there is one Jesus Christ
[1:15:11] is that right one man God Emmanuel do
[1:15:15] you believe that but the members of his
[1:15:20] wife not
[1:15:22] wives right
[1:15:23] the member of his wife one
[1:15:28] wife see thousand times thousand of
[1:15:33] thousand his wife bride the church do
[1:15:37] you understand
[1:15:40] that so that you who know which is right
[1:15:47] and which is
[1:15:48] wrong now he plainly shows here in this
[1:15:54] types there is one Christ and many
[1:15:59] members of that wife so Solomon 1,000
[1:16:04] wife was just a type of the many member
[1:16:09] body the many members that will make the
[1:16:14] bride
[1:16:16] right it's one bride it's one
[1:16:21] wife but she brought from every
[1:16:26] nation praise the Lord amen Saint uh uh
[1:16:31] since the Holy Ghost
[1:16:34] fell God has been bringing out his
[1:16:37] church he's been bringing out his bride
[1:16:40] the bride has been coming down from the
[1:16:42] Ephesian Church
[1:16:44] age many people think it's only people
[1:16:46] that in the message that is the bride no
[1:16:48] the bride being long coming it was Paul
[1:16:52] that says I want to to expose you to
[1:16:54] Christ as a Chase virgin yes sir praise
[1:16:58] the
[1:17:00] Lord so you see when you look at Solomon
[1:17:03] and His Thousand wives or 700 and
[1:17:06] concubine and whatever all you see is
[1:17:09] just filled for the matter of fact they
[1:17:10] even turned his heart away from
[1:17:14] God it's a perishable
[1:17:18] Glory praise the Lord
[1:17:22] amen but when you look at Christ and his
[1:17:25] 1,000 BR what the scripture
[1:17:27] says they were crying him Lord of
[1:17:31] lords they're going to cry him King of
[1:17:35] Kings praise the lord they're going to
[1:17:38] bring more worship to him John said I
[1:17:41] saw the throne sitting I saw boooks open
[1:17:43] and thousands and
[1:17:45] thousands were sitting there to judge
[1:17:47] the
[1:17:50] Earth are we together
[1:17:56] so can you see the perishable Glory with
[1:17:59] Solomon
[1:18:00] Glory but here said God by his grace
[1:18:04] just like how he sent Paul and and all
[1:18:07] the other messenger of the ages to call
[1:18:10] the people out of the Gentile for his
[1:18:12] name's sake so this message have come to
[1:18:14] call you and
[1:18:15] myself it have come to call us to this
[1:18:18] place of
[1:18:20] Glory praise the Lord amen
[1:18:23] they have come to call us to this place
[1:18:26] of
[1:18:28] Glory
[1:18:31] Hallelujah and I mean it's just like a
[1:18:34] type of Esther being called in in in in
[1:18:38] the land of the Persians and and and and
[1:18:40] and to to be a
[1:18:42] queen I believe it was a scary place for
[1:18:45] her to go she knew that she was a
[1:18:48] jeude praise the
[1:18:51] Lord and she was stepping out there but
[1:18:55] the Bible says she found favor before
[1:18:57] the king and that is the same thing that
[1:18:59] you and myself have found before the
[1:19:01] king but you see the the horrible thing
[1:19:04] we do we judge ourself by the things we
[1:19:06] go through the things we have and we
[1:19:09] don't even know the kind of a glory that
[1:19:11] he have put Upon
[1:19:15] Us Praise the Lord can you
[1:19:19] imagine we grapping a revelation that I
[1:19:22] in The Bride of Jesus Christ the way we
[1:19:25] will conduct
[1:19:28] ourselves to know that everything that
[1:19:30] heaven holds belongs to
[1:19:35] you praise the
[1:19:37] Lord no matter what we are going
[1:19:40] through we have to keep our heads up
[1:19:43] high Jesus said look up high your redem
[1:19:46] your your Redemption draw at
[1:19:51] night praise the
[1:19:55] Lord I believe all the kings around the
[1:19:58] Nations the Bible says of all Nations

[1:20:05] them told Israel not to marry to Solomon
[1:20:09] got a wife

[1:31:47] case of L wife sorry I'm I'm I'm a
[1:31:50] little bit little bit just distracted
[1:31:52] because there was something I wanted to
[1:31:53] to to bring out uh put the Cote out but
[1:31:56] I didn't I didn't add it to this I
[1:31:59] realized so I'm I'm just trying to uh
[1:32:02] search that out quickly and uh so he's
[1:32:05] building this case here and uh uh
[1:32:08] talking about Lord wife not listening to
[1:32:11] her husband not uh you know uh uh taking
[1:32:14] her husband word she's saying well I
[1:32:16] don't know maybe it's his personal
[1:32:18] revelation I don't see it like that you
[1:32:20] know what and then she's she it brought
[1:32:22] her to the place of turning back and
[1:32:24] here she turned into a pillow of salt
[1:32:26] and the prophet of God dropped this year
[1:32:28] he says your pastor is is your husband
[1:32:31] spiritually speaking you see it and then
[1:32:33] he went on with their statement praise
[1:32:35] the Lord and then you can go on and read
[1:32:38] the rest but you see how just that
[1:32:45] phrase has been taken as a
[1:32:50] Doctrine praise the Lord and I've I've
[1:32:54] said it to you over and over but I F
[1:32:55] that I should I should be able to read a
[1:32:57] quote to you tonight uh uh and and and
[1:33:00] and uh you know and and make you to see
[1:33:04] you know uh where where it all develop
[1:33:09] from praise the Lord amen now if if if
[1:33:14] we want to do a Bible studies here
[1:33:16] tonight Lord was not a
[1:33:19] messenger
[1:33:20] right
[1:33:22] are we together he was not a messenger
[1:33:26] the
[1:33:26] messenger HH H the man of of of that
[1:33:30] hour was was was Abraham in in every
[1:33:33] sense he was the one that God was
[1:33:35] dealing
[1:33:36] with praise the
[1:33:38] Lord the messenger were the angels that
[1:33:41] came to lot he was not a
[1:33:45] messenger he was just a backslid of man
[1:33:47] that went down there to
[1:33:49] Sodom are we together
[1:33:52] amen I'm going I'm going I'm going to to
[1:33:55] somewhere with this because you see in a
[1:33:58] way that this code has been uh uh uh
[1:34:02] placed in the place of a Doctrine you
[1:34:05] see if if it is if if if a Doctrine is
[1:34:08] not based on the word of God is it's
[1:34:10] quick to it's it's it's
[1:34:13] dangerous it can destroy people lives it
[1:34:16] can destroy people
[1:34:18] homes and just for my little time around
[1:34:21] uh the word and around the message I've
[1:34:23] seen how this particular statement has
[1:34:26] destroyed people homes yes because they
[1:34:29] have put preachers to the place where
[1:34:31] they think they can run people
[1:34:35] homes because they think that they are
[1:34:37] the spiritual
[1:34:40] husband but I I'll show to you tonight
[1:34:43] that brother brandham did not establish
[1:34:45] this thing as auline I show to you one
[1:34:49] of the simplest way I can show it to you
[1:34:51] is right from the same
[1:34:53] message praise the
[1:34:56] Lord
[1:34:58] amen right from the same message and if
[1:35:01] you have time you can go home that's
[1:35:03] paragraph
[1:35:04] 197 that is the second to the last
[1:35:07] paragraph before the message ends
[1:35:10] brother brandham says until I see you
[1:35:12] tonight God love you and be with you you
[1:35:18] are my children of the Gospel
[1:35:23] you are the
[1:35:26] purchase now he says the pastor is the
[1:35:29] spiritual husband why why didn't he say
[1:35:31] you are my
[1:35:35] wife and there is nowhere you will find
[1:35:38] in the message where brother brandham
[1:35:40] ever referred to the church that you are
[1:35:42] my
[1:35:43] wife he says you are my children in the
[1:35:50] gospel
[1:35:52] I was so burdened with this couple of
[1:35:56] months and some time back so burdened
[1:35:58] with this as I I rote over this message
[1:36:01] over and over the Lord used this very
[1:36:04] last
[1:36:12] quote until I see you God love you and
[1:36:16] God be with you you are my children in
[1:36:18] the gospel if he was established there
[1:36:21] to be a
[1:36:23] Doctrine he will say you are my
[1:36:29] wives Paul said you are my children you
[1:36:33] will even give your eyes if I asked for
[1:36:38] it praise the Lord now the reason why
[1:36:41] I'm bringing this out because Solomon in
[1:36:44] all of his
[1:36:46] glory measuring on the natural Glory it
[1:36:50] took his heart away from the Lord and
[1:36:53] men that have applied this quote
[1:36:56] naturally many have gone go got
[1:36:59] themselves into some some form of
[1:37:01] idolatry or
[1:37:03] that praise the Lord but then if the
[1:37:08] many members are one wife to Christ
[1:37:14] which is our
[1:37:15] Solomon
[1:37:17] amen then how can a man like myself
[1:37:22] praise the
[1:37:23] Lord I'm your pastor I'm I'm The
[1:37:27] Shepherd of this church but he's the
[1:37:29] chief
[1:37:31] Shepherd my shepherd work is to stay
[1:37:34] before the Lord pray and bring you a
[1:37:36] message I don't know what you are doing
[1:37:38] to your house I can't keep you safe in
[1:37:41] the street he keep you safe he's the one
[1:37:45] that is watching over you he watch over
[1:37:48] your
[1:37:50] soul
[1:37:53] praise the Lord then how can me being a
[1:37:56] man man human being be more spiritual
[1:37:59] hosal to you than
[1:38:01] Jesus
[1:38:09] how praise the
[1:38:11] Lord how can I Mar human being like
[1:38:15] me trusting on the grace of God to be
[1:38:18] able to bring something to you do you
[1:38:20] see how man has used this to hold on to
[1:38:23] the life of people keep them on
[1:38:29] fear and even some men has used this
[1:38:31] very quote to abuse the church abuse
[1:38:34] women in the
[1:38:41] church are we
[1:38:47] together brother Bram was says here
[1:38:54] are we
[1:39:00] together he will say
[1:39:13] here listen to year that the message
[1:39:16] job I think he preached that 1956 he
[1:39:19] says now in a spiritual meaning of it it
[1:39:24] says in the spiritual meaning of
[1:39:26] it that each one of those family the
[1:39:30] father being the priest of his own home
[1:39:36] is that not
[1:39:38] scriptural Paul says if you want to
[1:39:40] learn anything ask your
[1:39:43] husband praise the
[1:39:45] Lord if he don't know he can ask the
[1:39:50] pastor praise the Lord or invite the
[1:39:52] pastor to your
[1:39:55] home so brother Bram year is is is is
[1:39:59] making us to see it right from the
[1:40:01] beginning Adam was the priest of his
[1:40:13] home and in a spiritual meaning of
[1:40:17] it that each one of those family the
[1:40:20] father being the priest of his own home
[1:40:23] they was to kill the lamb for each house
[1:40:27] that they could eat the meat and but
[1:40:32] it all represented one
[1:40:37] lamb are we
[1:40:40] together
[1:40:42] amen are you see what I'm going
[1:40:44] tonight praise the
[1:40:47] Lord because we we have to understand in
[1:40:51] this
[1:40:54] thing the scripture tells us and the
[1:40:56] message tells us we must never Lo over
[1:40:59] God's
[1:41:01] people praise the Lord amen I'm required
[1:41:06] by the scripture to live such a life for
[1:41:08] you to have confidence in me if my life
[1:41:11] is is is is is is not bringing you to
[1:41:14] that place of confidence there is no way
[1:41:16] I can shout at you or preach out you
[1:41:19] jump up and down and and intimidate you
[1:41:22] for it to create faith in
[1:41:29] you that's the reason why the scripture
[1:41:31] holds the man of God at with with a
[1:41:35] strong
[1:41:36] responsibility yes
[1:41:38] sir why because if he lives a life that
[1:41:41] stumbl the people they lose that
[1:41:43] confidence they can never build fed
[1:41:48] again they cannot be fa that that's the
[1:41:50] reason why that me I mean it's not
[1:41:52] something that a man can go to school
[1:41:54] for it's something that God must call a
[1:41:56] man
[1:42:02] for are we
[1:42:04] together now so you see yeah uh uh uh
[1:42:10] uh oh praise the
[1:42:14] Lord my time is up
[1:42:18] here so Solomon in all of his Glory
[1:42:21] that's that's where that's where we want
[1:42:23] to we want to we we want to hold you
[1:42:25] here just so you can be able to realize
[1:42:27] there because remember I told you we
[1:42:30] coming down to the kingdom the power and
[1:42:32] the
[1:42:34] glory the lord will give us Grace uh to
[1:42:37] be able to break into that but you see
[1:42:39] that uh uh how God built those things
[1:42:44] Jesus our lord Jesus God coming in
[1:42:48] flesh bringing the people right to the
[1:42:51] time he he he's taking the most glorious
[1:42:54] age in
[1:42:56] Israel the most time that Israel has
[1:42:59] ever experienced
[1:43:01] peace the most time that every nation
[1:43:05] around the world respected it he's
[1:43:08] taking that
[1:43:11] time trying to make them to
[1:43:14] know it was just a
[1:43:19] shadow it was just a
[1:43:23] shadow like the prophet said you can
[1:43:26] never get warm by pained
[1:43:29] fire you can admire it but it will never
[1:43:32] make you
[1:43:35] warm praise the Lord it was just a
[1:43:38] shadow it was a glory that fed
[1:43:42] away that is so much that when Solomon
[1:43:45] left the throne the Kingdom of Israel
[1:43:48] splitted into
[1:43:49] two
[1:43:52] re his son took to Benjamin and Judah
[1:43:56] and and and jeam took 10
[1:44:04] tribes praise the
[1:44:08] Lord he said not one stone will be left
[1:44:12] upon
[1:44:15] another and what he did he took them
[1:44:18] right to the temple he said look at this
[1:44:21] Temple now one stone will be
[1:44:24] left on the
[1:44:28] other praise the
[1:44:30] Lord because the people were so captured
[1:44:33] so drawn to a physical Temple fighting
[1:44:35] for the physical ground and
[1:44:38] God was
[1:44:41] building a spiritual
[1:44:44] home he was building he was preparing
[1:44:47] them for a time of the Holy
[1:44:49] Ghost where the Holy Ghost will
[1:44:52] come praise the Lord he was preparing
[1:44:56] them for the upper
[1:44:58] room Lord is it this is it the time that
[1:45:02] we will take over the
[1:45:03] kingdom he said it is not for you to
[1:45:07] know praise the Lord it is not for you
[1:45:10] to
[1:45:11] know can you
[1:45:13] imagine what might have happened to
[1:45:16] Peter after the Holy Ghost came and he
[1:45:19] start the spiritual
[1:45:23] Revelation he's the one that says uh you
[1:45:26] you are born of you are precious stones
[1:45:28] born of precious stones and and all of
[1:45:30] those things he said there he was the
[1:45:32] one that says from Faith to Virtue and
[1:45:35] knowledge Peter was the one that say
[1:45:36] other can you imagine when he started
[1:45:39] understanding that
[1:45:41] thing this was the very same man that
[1:45:43] took out the sword to cut somebody ear
[1:45:46] can you imagine he realized how my
[1:45:49] Revelation was so Conor right when
[1:45:53] people are just fighting over physical
[1:45:55] things
[1:45:56] yes and having no knowledge of the of
[1:46:00] the spiritual
[1:46:02] Glory that you could tap into and your
[1:46:05] life would never be the same the the
[1:46:08] spiritual Glory that you could press
[1:46:11] into can you imagine what he Tau of
[1:46:15] think about Paul that got the mystery of
[1:46:17] the New Testament a messenger to the
[1:46:19] Gentile
[1:46:22] yeah brother Brandon say that's the
[1:46:24] reason why Paul seal his life to
[1:46:28] death he rather choose to die for this
[1:46:31] gospel after he
[1:46:33] realized that the thing that he was
[1:46:36] killing the disciples for it was a
[1:46:39] fielded
[1:46:40] glory after he realized that the
[1:46:43] traditions of his fathers had no weight
[1:46:47] Paul say I would rather die for this he
[1:46:51] denied himself a home denied himself a
[1:46:54] wife he said change wait for
[1:46:58] me against all prophecy that came Paul
[1:47:02] say I would rather walk into
[1:47:04] death because he he because he broke
[1:47:07] into the
[1:47:09] glory that that there was nothing in
[1:47:12] this life that Paul could hold to he
[1:47:15] says I labored among you if I wanted a
[1:47:18] wife I could take one of the sisters
[1:47:21] for the matter of fact the work that
[1:47:22] I've done done among you you supposed to
[1:47:25] take care of me but he says I work with
[1:47:26] my own hands why because he had broke
[1:47:30] into the
[1:47:34] glory he was lifted up into the 10
[1:47:37] Heavens he said eyes have not seen ears
[1:47:41] have not heard neither have it come
[1:47:43] close to your
[1:47:46] heart the
[1:47:49] glory
[1:47:50] praise the
[1:47:52] Lord the glory that brother Steve jamb
[1:47:56] has stepped
[1:47:58] into the glory that sister M brother
[1:48:01] Scar and all of these loved ones that
[1:48:02] have gone the glory that they have
[1:48:04] stepped
[1:48:06] into you will not come close to knowing
[1:48:10] it you will not come close to
[1:48:14] knor the glory that is hovering around
[1:48:18] your life right the the glory that is
[1:48:21] keeping you going every
[1:48:24] day is not the food you ate
[1:48:29] yesterday for men shall not laid by
[1:48:31] bread alone but laid by every word that
[1:48:34] proceed out of the mouth of God praise
[1:48:37] the
[1:48:39] Lord if you have a revelation of that
[1:48:41] Glory you will find something for from
[1:48:44] the scripture to feel your soul every
[1:48:46] day you will find something from the
[1:48:48] word of God to feel your soul every
[1:48:53] day you will not be snacking on the word
[1:48:56] of
[1:48:57] God praise the Lord
[1:49:01] amen we have God used to Tak a snack on
[1:49:05] the word of God just reading one Bible
[1:49:08] verse and know you will find something
[1:49:10] to Fe your
[1:49:11] soul whether it's a chapter in the book
[1:49:14] or whether it's a
[1:49:15] subject that is on your heart that you
[1:49:18] can read few verses
[1:49:22] praise the
[1:49:24] Lord or you can get over to the to the
[1:49:27] to the table and pull out a court and
[1:49:30] says let me see what the prophet say on
[1:49:33] this the Pastor said this let me go and
