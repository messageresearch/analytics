[0:00] [Music]
[0:35] just beyond anything that we could
[0:37] express in human languages
[0:42] of how our hearts feel today as we
[0:45] gather here on this most solemn sacred
[0:49] morning today
[0:53] this morning represents the time that
[0:55] when
[0:57] our religion was made real
[1:01] because it was the
[1:03] rising up again of thy precious child
[1:07] who
[1:08] came to redeem the whole human race
[1:13] and we're here this morning in
[1:15] celebration of that
[1:17] great
[1:19] supreme triumph lord that made us more
[1:23] than conquerors of both death hell and
[1:26] the grave praise
[1:29] and we thank thee
[1:31] that after all these years have passed
[1:35] we still gather early every morning on
[1:38] this easter morning to worship him
[1:40] because we believe that he shall come
[1:43] again
[1:44] [Music]
[1:46] and we would pray that you would forgive
[1:48] all of our sins and our trespasses
[1:52] that is recorded against us
[1:56] as we humbly confess our wrong and
[1:59] accept his atonement
[2:02] for our sins
[2:05] heal the sickness that's in the midst of
[2:07] us lord
[2:09] help us as we read thy holy word
[2:14] which is the foundation of all of the
[2:17] truths that you have left for us to live
[2:20] by
[2:21] and to believe
[2:21] [Music]
[2:23] and we pray not only for this group
[2:25] that's gathered here but all around the
[2:29] world
[2:31] while we are looking with eager eyes and
[2:35] longing hearts
[2:36] for his return
[2:39] we stand today in darkness
[2:42] in a chaos that when
[2:45] most any time that some
[2:48] fanatic might just blow up about
[2:51] something and turn a little
[2:54] button then the whole world could be
[2:57] blown into bits
[3:00] as it has been told us by great
[3:03] authorities that
[3:04] the wars will only be a few hours long
[3:07] if it ever happens again
[3:10] oh as we're standing today on the very
[3:13] brim of another war
[3:25] for we shall be caught up together with
[3:28] the sleeping saints to meet the lord in
[3:31] the air and forever be with him
[3:34] we have come to worship the lord and
[3:36] receive us today please bless the
[3:39] reading of thy word the singing of the
[3:41] song
[3:43] the preaching of the gospel receive the
[3:47] prayers of the penitent
[3:49] hear a prayer for the sick and get glory
[3:52] unto ourselves
[3:53] are we humbly asked it in the name of
[3:56] jesus
[3:57] thy son
[3:59] amen
[4:14] to you who would like to take were we're
[4:17] to read this morning for our scriptures
[4:20] and we're sorry that
[4:22] this to know that we do not have the
[4:25] seating room for this fine group of
[4:27] people who's come early this morning to
[4:30] worship with us
[4:32] from different churches and from
[4:34] different states and even different
[4:36] nations

[4:39] tabernacle for this
[4:41] most
[4:42] glorious worship of the lord amen
[4:47] i wish for you to turn to the book of
[4:50] psalms
[4:51] psalms 22.
[4:54] i know this is rather an unusual
[4:57] place to read for an easter service
[5:01] but god is unusual

[5:44] the last time we can have this for a
[5:47] while anyhow i'm leaving in the morning
[5:49] at five o'clock for los angeles and
[5:52] through the west coast for a series of
[5:54] services
[5:56] [Music]
[5:57] now in psalms 22 we shall read
[6:03] my god my god why has thou forsaken me
[6:08] why art thou so far from helping me
[6:12] from the words of my roaring
[6:15] my god i cry in the daytime but thou
[6:19] hearst not
[6:20] and in the night season
[6:23] and am not silent
[6:26] but thou art holy
[6:28] oh thou that inhabits the praises of
[6:31] israel
[6:33] our fathers trusted in thee
[6:36] they trusted and thou did deliver them
[6:41] they cried unto thee and were delivered
[6:44] they trusted in thee and were not
[6:46] confounded
[6:48] but i am a worm
[6:50] and no man
[6:52] a reproach of man
[6:56] despised of the people
[6:59] all they that see me laugh me to scorn
[7:04] they shoot out the lip
[7:07] and they shake the head saying
[7:10] he trusted on the lord that he would
[7:12] deliver him
[7:14] let him deliver him seeing he delighteth
[7:17] in him
[7:20] but
[7:22] thou art he that took me out of the womb
[7:25] thou didst make me hope when i was upon
[7:28] my mother's breasts
[7:31] i was cast upon thee from the womb
[7:34] dark my god from my mother's belly
[7:38] be not far from me for trouble is near
[7:44] for there is none to help
[7:47] many bulls have compassed me
[7:51] strong bulls of basham
[7:53] have beset me around
[7:57] they gasp upon me with their mouth
[8:01] as a raving and roaring line
[8:05] i am pouring out like water
[8:09] all my bones are out of joint
[8:12] my heart
[8:15] is like wax it is melted
[8:17] in the midst of my bowels
[8:20] my strength is dried up like a potter's
[8:25] my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou
[8:28] has brought me unto the dust of the
[8:30] earth
[8:32] for dogs have come past me
[8:35] the assemblies of the wicked have closed
[8:38] me
[8:39] they pierce my hands
[8:43] and my feet
[8:46] i may tell all my bones that they look
[8:48] and stare up on me
[8:51] they parted my garments among them
[8:54] cast lots upon my vesture
[8:58] be thou not far from me o lord
[9:01] my strength
[9:02] hasten thee to help me
[9:05] deliver my soul from the sore
[9:10] my darling from the power of the dogs
[9:14] save me from the lion's mouth
[9:16] for thou has heard me from the horns of
[9:19] the unicorn
[9:21] i will declare thy name
[9:23] unto my brethren
[9:25] in the midst of the congregation i will
[9:28] praise thee
[9:30] yea
[9:32] ye that fear the lord praise him all
[9:36] yeast seeds of jacob glorify him
[9:39] and fear him all ye seeds of israel
[9:42] for he is not despised
[9:45] or part of the affliction
[9:48] neither has he hid his face from him
[9:52] but when he cried unto him he heard
[9:55] my praise shall be of thee in the great
[9:59] congregation
[10:01] i will pay my vows before them that fear
[10:04] him
[10:05] the meat shall eat and be satisfied
[10:08] they shall praise the lord that seek him
[10:12] your heart shall live forever
[10:16] all the ends of the world shall remember
[10:20] and turn unto the lord
[10:23] and all the kindreds of the nation shall
[10:25] worship before him
[10:28] for the kingdom
[10:29] is of the lord
[10:32] and he is the governor among the nations
[10:36] all they that be fat upon earth shall
[10:38] eat and worship
[10:40] all they that go down to the dust shall
[10:43] bow before him
[10:45] and none can keep alive his own soul
[10:49] a seed shall serve him
[10:51] it shall be accounted to the lord for a
[10:53] generation
[10:56] they shall come
[10:57] and shall declare his righteousness unto
[11:01] a people
[11:02] and shall that shall be born
[11:06] that he has done this
[11:09] may the lord add his blessings to the
[11:11] reading of his word
[11:18] i
[11:19] want to take for this
[11:21] occasion this morning
[11:24] five words
[11:27] and around those five words try to
[11:29] express
[11:31] what's on my heart to you
[11:33] worshipers this morning
[11:36] i want these five words
[11:38] living
[11:40] dying
[11:42] buried
[11:44] rising
[11:45] coming
[11:47] and i think the poet well expressed it
[11:50] in the song
[11:52] of what i'd want to say when he wrote
[11:54] this song
[11:56] living he loved me
[12:00] dying he saved me
[12:03] buried he carried my sins far away
[12:08] rising he justified
[12:10] freely forever
[12:13] someday he's coming
[12:16] oh glorious day
[12:19] thank god
[12:21] there never was a life ever lived like
[12:24] his
[12:26] because he was the god
[12:31] manifested in the flesh when he was born
[12:35] he was an expression of what god the
[12:38] father is
[12:41] and god the father being
[12:43] loved
[12:45] then jesus was a full expression of love
[12:49] he was loved from the very first time
[12:53] that his
[12:54] little baby hand stroked the pretty
[12:56] cheeks of his mother
[12:59] he was loved
[13:02] and i think today that that's where
[13:06] manny is failing to recognize that he
[13:10] was love
[13:14] god is love
[13:16] and they that love are born of god
[13:21] god's soul love the world
[13:25] that is the unlovable
[13:28] that he gave his only begotten son
[13:31] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[13:34] not perish but would have
[13:37] everlasting life
[13:41] he expressed his love when he was your
[13:43] on earth
[13:45] in so many different ways till it is
[13:48] undisputable that he was the most
[13:50] loving creature that ever lived
[13:56] now i think in his life here he was
[13:58] expressing
[14:00] god in the only way that god can be
[14:03] expressed to the people is through love
[14:09] and well did he do this
[14:12] when he caught one of the most balanced
[14:15] women nectar was of his days perhaps
[14:20] they found her
[14:23] just guilty
[14:26] and no way out when she was found in
[14:29] adultery and they'd drug her up before
[14:32] him and said what do you say do for her
[14:37] and when he turned to her
[14:40] and said
[14:41] i don't condemn thee go and sin no more
[14:48] instead of being throwing her out to the
[14:50] streets to be drug out like a bunch of
[14:54] wolves
[14:55] over her to stone her and take her life
[14:59] his tender kind loving heart stew
[15:02] weighed down into the sin that she was
[15:04] in
[15:06] [Music]
[15:07] said i don't condemn me
[15:11] just go and don't sin no more
[15:17] and when he was on his way down to the
[15:20] grave of lazarus
[15:24] i think there's another great time
[15:28] that he expressed what god is to the
[15:31] human beings
[15:34] not only is he a god that can forgive
[15:38] the lord's sin that can be committed
[15:42] and
[15:43] take the guilty and make them guiltless
[15:46] by his pardoning love
[15:49] but after death has laid us in silence
[15:54] he's still concerned about us
[15:58] hallelujah i think he will express that
[16:01] on the road down with martha and mary
[16:06] when he come to the housework death and
[16:09] shut out the life of a lovely person
[16:15] and always wrote down to the grave yet
[16:18] being god know that he would raise him
[16:21] from the dead amen
[16:24] know that it had been told him then in
[16:27] his very words laid the power to raise
[16:31] him from the grave amen
[16:34] yet when he seen martha and mary and
[16:37] those who loved lazarus crying
[16:40] the bible said he wept
[16:43] what was it
[16:45] his great loving heart
[16:48] hey
[16:50] when he seen that
[16:52] man and his
[16:54] his friends were in trouble he was
[16:57] troubled with them
[17:00] i'm so glad to know that he can be found
[17:03] amongst the brokenhearted
[17:06] praise god in our sorrows he's not one
[17:09] that would leave us
[17:10] [Music]
[17:11] he stands by us when all has failed and
[17:14] the last hopes of earthly reaching has
[17:19] come to its end he's still gone and
[17:22] loves us
[17:25] he was the expression of god
[17:29] know how i believe
[17:32] that he longs for his people to be so
[17:36] anointed with his spirit
[17:39] that we could
[17:40] go to each other in trials and in
[17:43] troubles
[17:45] and give the expression
[17:47] of his sympathy
[17:50] as it pours from our hearts that's been
[17:53] borned off his spirit
[17:56] to reflect in the church
[17:59] the love of the living god
[18:04] that will express what he said or the
[18:06] poet said
[18:08] living he loved me
[18:11] he showed what he did to the whole human
[18:15] race the way god represented himself in
[18:18] jesus christ amen he expressed
[18:22] his opinion
[18:25] to the human race
[18:27] to forgive and to love
[18:31] those who were unlovable
[18:35] and i wonder on this easter morning
[18:38] how short we followed that
[18:42] we can love those who love us
[18:45] but he loved those who did not love him
[18:50] he was the greatest
[18:52] of
[18:54] representation of love that ever hit the
[18:57] earth and it was despised of those who
[19:00] lived on the earth to whom he loved
[19:05] no man
[19:06] could ever love like him and
[19:09] no man was ever hated like him
[19:13] they hated him and despised him and
[19:16] rejected him
[19:18] but it did not stop his
[19:22] [Music]
[19:23] the love one he was hanging on the cross
[19:26] after that
[19:28] life that he had lived
[19:30] had been done nothing but good things
[19:35] forgiving the guilty
[19:38] healing the sick
[19:41] and just things that were good but it
[19:43] was less breaths
[19:46] on the cross with the
[19:48] voter mocking spit
[19:51] all them who stood behind from his
[19:54] sacred face
[19:56] he cried with a heart full of love
[19:58] father forgiven
[20:01] amen for they know not what they do
[20:06] he could understand
[20:09] being god he understands
[20:12] that's why he can love us when we're
[20:14] unlovable because he's god and he
[20:16] understands
[20:18] amen lady he loved me
[20:23] never life lived like it because it was
[20:25] wrapped in love
[20:28] dying
[20:29] he saved me
[20:33] a death
[20:35] when in the garden of eden
[20:38] god
[20:39] jehovah required the penalty of sin is
[20:43] death
[20:46] and there could be no alterations
[20:50] it could not be any other way taken care
[20:53] of because
[20:54] god is supreme
[20:56] and he is infinite
[20:59] and the judge of all heavens and earth
[21:02] the
[21:03] penalty of
[21:05] sin is
[21:06] death
[21:10] and there was no one who could
[21:12] pay this
[21:14] penalty for another
[21:18] for every man though he might die for
[21:20] another man but he was guilty to begin
[21:24] with
[21:25] amen it was none of us that could help
[21:28] the
[21:28] other because we were all guilty
[21:33] we are born in sin shaped in iniquity
[21:37] come to the world speaking lies
[21:41] and there was not a real hope nowhere
[21:45] we were condemned to death by god
[21:50] and every creature that ever moved on
[21:52] the earth was under this condemnation
[21:56] there could be righteous man rise and do
[21:59] great things but he was a sinner to
[22:02] begin with
[22:04] there was only one way fart to be paid
[22:09] that was the death of god himself
[22:13] so god being a spirit could not die
[22:17] but he came down in a body of flesh and
[22:21] expressed himself
[22:22] and a life of love to take all that
[22:26] goodness
[22:28] that he wants amen
[22:30] and give it
[22:32] willingly as a supreme sacrifice
[22:35] that he might take the guilt
[22:39] the guilty
[22:41] [Music]
[22:44] all of us being sinners
[22:48] are not a way in the world for us to
[22:50] ever be saved
[22:52] he came not only to be seen on earth but
[22:56] he came to die as a sacrifice
[23:01] abel expressed it
[23:03] when he offered unto god a more
[23:05] excellent sacrifice and came
[23:08] when he brought the little lamb with a
[23:11] piece of grapevine wrapped around his
[23:14] neck to a rock
[23:16] there laid the little color up on the
[23:18] rock pull his little chin back in with a
[23:21] a rock pounding its little throat
[23:24] and it bleeding and dying and the blood
[23:28] is squirting out
[23:30] this little white locks become
[23:32] bathed with blood
[23:37] able express calvary there
[23:40] when the lamb of god slain from the
[23:44] foundation of the world
[23:47] came to take the place of guilty sinners
[23:50] and was mashed and bruised and
[23:53] and scoffed and made fun of and
[23:56] died of death that no creature could die
[24:01] except god himself
[24:03] and his bloody locks hanging from his
[24:06] shoulders dripping to the ground
[24:08] express what a horrible thing that sin
[24:12] is
[24:13] when he had to die to redeem man from a
[24:17] life of sin
[24:20] nothing could die like that
[24:23] nothing could stand that death
[24:26] it said that when they pierced his side
[24:30] that there came forth blood and water
[24:35] it's been some time ago i was speaking
[24:37] to
[24:39] someone
[24:40] about this
[24:41] and it was a scientist that said
[24:43] there is only one way that that could
[24:45] have happened
[24:47] and it was not
[24:49] because of the roman spear
[24:52] that he died
[24:53] and neither wasn't the loss of blood
[24:56] that he died because there was still
[24:58] blood in his body
[25:01] what he died of was not because of the
[25:03] roman spear
[25:05] or the nails that was drove in his hand
[25:09] or the thorny crown they placed on his
[25:12] head
[25:13] but because he died of grief
[25:18] because he came to his own in his own
[25:21] receiving
[25:23] [Music]
[25:24] he died of a broken heart when he knows
[25:28] the very creatures of time that he had
[25:31] done to redeem had spit in his face and
[25:34] he was rejected of man
[25:37] david 800 years before it happened cry
[25:40] of the very voice that he cried at
[25:42] calvary my god why has now forsaken me
[25:46] [Music]
[25:47] what a terrible thing that sin does
[25:50] it separates man from god
[25:55] he was a sin offering
[25:57] that had to be offered for our sins
[26:00] and he was separated from the presence
[26:02] of god
[26:04] sin and separating
[26:06] god placed our sins upon him
[26:10] and he was separated from god and that's
[26:12] why he cried why has thou forsaken me
[26:18] and because he was forsaken
[26:20] and have taken this place
[26:22] and seen his people that he would come
[26:24] to be their savior and to offer them
[26:27] life they had rejected him and he
[26:30] grieved him so tall he was so
[26:32] brokenhearted in terms of blood water
[26:34] the chemicals of his body
[26:36] separated amen
[26:39] man will never know
[26:41] what that was
[26:42] that's the reason there could be no one
[26:45] else could ever die like that
[26:47] i don't care how much that you could be
[26:50] tormented how that they might put your
[26:53] feet in stocks or saw you by inches or
[26:56] burn you by inches you could not die of
[26:58] that death
[26:59] because your makeup's not like that
[27:02] he had to be god
[27:05] he had to be more than man in the faith
[27:08] that god died
[27:12] he died of a broken heart with such
[27:14] grief for the world until a chemical
[27:17] reaction taken place in his body that
[27:19] could not take place in you
[27:21] you cannot suffer like that
[27:23] there's no way for you to have that kind
[27:25] of a grief
[27:26] so there's only one could do it and he
[27:29] did it
[27:31] they're hanging
[27:33] that precious life that knows nothing
[27:35] but love doing good
[27:37] come there between the heavens and the
[27:39] earth
[27:41] lifted up there stripped naked
[27:44] embarrassed think how you'd be stripping
[27:47] naked
[27:48] you were no embarrassment to what god
[27:50] wanted
[27:51] hanging there i know the crucifix has a
[27:54] little thing like they had something
[27:55] around him but they never did that
[27:57] that's just put on the crosser the
[27:59] artist put it there they stripped his
[28:01] clothes from his head on a rope and then
[28:03] tore off of him and gambled for it
[28:07] he was a bad to the utmost let me and
[28:10] god had to stand and sitters spit on his
[28:13] face
[28:19] had to die before the public script
[28:22] naked
[28:24] such a fact it took upon him until it
[28:26] separated the water and the blood
[28:30] no wonder i think the point well
[28:32] expressed it when he said
[28:34] rendering rocks and darkening scars my
[28:37] savior bowed his head and died
[28:40] but the opening they'll reveal the way
[28:43] to heaven's joys and endless days
[28:48] sure
[28:49] you had to do it the veil hung between
[28:52] man and god
[28:54] and that opening veil revealed the way
[28:58] to heaven's joyous and endless day
[29:03] cowardly means something
[29:05] means more than we can express
[29:07] sure
[29:08] living he loved
[29:10] me dying he saved me
[29:14] and buried he carried my sins far away
[29:20] it's been condemned now
[29:22] sin has no more hope
[29:24] when he screamed at the cross it's
[29:26] finished
[29:29] sin died
[29:32] that's dead
[29:35] it's done with it's powerless it's
[29:37] lifeless
[29:39] think of it people that send the enemy
[29:42] to human beings is dead and lifeless
[29:46] it has no more effect
[29:48] it can't
[29:51] one of the sun shut off its vision the
[29:54] stars are not shining
[29:56] the earth turned black
[29:59] is all being redeemed
[30:03] now it's dead
[30:05] it's buried
[30:06] it's lifeless it has no more life that
[30:09] it must be buried
[30:11] what was buried
[30:12] the body of god was buried
[30:15] for it was a sin offering
[30:17] amen it was a burnt lamb
[30:20] it was buried up by the fires of
[30:22] iniquity
[30:24] that
[30:25] sinless
[30:26] lamb that know no sin
[30:29] that god who knows no wrong
[30:32] his life has been given and down
[30:37] buried
[30:38] he carried my sins far away
[30:41] he must be buried
[30:43] the body the sin offering must be buried
[30:46] that's why many after a while will walk
[30:49] one by one to this pool
[30:52] amen to be baptized in the name of jesus
[30:54] christ
[30:56] why
[30:57] something has taken place
[31:01] that spirit that came out of that body
[31:04] when he screamed it's finished has
[31:05] condemned sin in our bodies
[31:09] and we must bury it
[31:11] to be remembered no more
[31:14] i'm so glad that it is when anything's
[31:16] buried his head
[31:18] it's out of sight
[31:21] and buried he carried my sins far away
[31:27] god can see our sins no more
[31:31] for they are buried
[31:33] they are buried where
[31:34] in the sea i forget to listen
[31:39] think of a sea
[31:41] of forgetfulness
[31:44] god cannot remember them no more because
[31:47] they are both dead and buried
[31:50] amen they cannot be remembered no more
[31:54] they're out of god's memory
[31:58] he was also
[31:59] in this very he represented in the old
[32:01] testament
[32:03] they had two they had a sin offering at
[32:06] the cleansing of the sanctuary
[32:09] and that sin offering was that they've
[32:11] taken two goals
[32:13] and one goat was killed
[32:17] and the other goat
[32:18] had the sins that was placed upon the
[32:20] dead goat
[32:22] put up on the live goat
[32:24] remember jesus was a sheep
[32:28] he was a lamb
[32:30] but in this case he become a goat
[32:35] he was righteousness
[32:37] because he was god
[32:39] the sheep but he become a gold sin
[32:43] and it might be the sin offering for me
[32:45] in you
[32:47] from a
[32:48] sheep to a goat
[32:51] and jesus is representing both the
[32:53] animals both goats
[32:56] for one he died
[32:58] he died for the atonement
[33:01] the second the sins from the atonement
[33:03] was put on the scapegoat
[33:05] and the scapegoat took the sins of the
[33:07] people and went far into the wilderness
[33:10] to bear the sins of the people what was
[33:13] it it was the death and the burial of
[33:17] our lord jesus
[33:19] dying
[33:21] living he loved me dying he saved me
[33:24] buried he carried my sins far away
[33:29] he took the sins of the people upon
[33:31] himself and carried them plumbed down
[33:34] into the lowest of hades
[33:39] he was the sin offering
[33:41] he had the sins of the people he died
[33:42] for them and also the sins was placed
[33:44] upon him and he took our sins far away
[33:48] so far that god can never see him no
[33:51] more
[33:53] thank god oh the church can scream
[33:56] hallelujah for such a savior amen
[33:59] not only is our sins forgiven but they
[34:02] are buried in the sea of forgetfulness
[34:04] to be remembered no more
[34:06] buried he carried our sins far away
[34:11] no more can they be remembered
[34:14] or they are gone they're out of the eyes
[34:17] of god their past
[34:20] they're divorced they're put away god
[34:22] don't remember him no more
[34:25] but the church ought to rejoice this
[34:27] morning
[34:28] to know that our sins will no more be
[34:31] remembered
[34:32] they are put in the sea of forgiveness
[34:35] into the grave of

[35:03] surely believed among us
[35:05] and they're most surely the truth
[35:08] they're god's truth

[49:47] what religious
[49:48] sect they they have fellowship with that

[50:05] and he took our sins and buried him and
[50:07] we stand alone in him our churches

[2:21:39] she's staying that sister filament
[2:21:42] there's brother cully's
[2:21:44] wife
[2:21:49] [Music]
[2:21:50] [Applause]
[2:21:55] [Music]
[2:22:00] so uh this morning
[2:22:08] um
[2:22:10] i got uh
[2:22:12] two important calls this morning
[2:22:15] and uh
[2:22:17] one was a testimony
[2:22:19] from
[2:22:20] sister helena there's brother bill's
[2:22:23] mother
[2:22:24] and
[2:22:26] she went for
[2:22:27] a
[2:22:28] funeral yesterday
[2:22:31] and she was supposed to be
[2:22:33] [Music]
[2:22:35] with her
[2:22:37] on her knees
[2:22:39] and
[2:22:40] but
[2:22:41] for some reason the niece felt that
[2:22:45] she should take her home
[2:22:48] right after the funeral
[2:22:51] and then
[2:22:53] when she when she got home
[2:22:56] you know i mean
[2:22:57] that time of the morning
[2:23:00] i was i was actually up
[2:23:03] the first call came in i think around
[2:23:05] four am in the morning
[2:23:07] so uh when hawk call came in uh i knew
[2:23:10] it was it was something serious because
[2:23:13] i thought well if it was anything she
[2:23:15] she would talk to me after church if you
[2:23:18] call me that time of the morning then it
[2:23:20] should be something very serious and i
[2:23:22] could tell from her voice
[2:23:25] when i spoke to her
[2:23:26] and
[2:23:28] when
[2:23:29] when she got back home
[2:23:31] which of course
[2:23:34] i mean friday night our brother
[2:23:38] ben preach on
[2:23:40] many story spirits
[2:23:42] you know
[2:23:44] teaching us from the word how uh
[2:23:48] we are in calm
[2:23:50] by angels
[2:23:52] you know when the scripture says the
[2:23:53] angels of the lord i didn't come about
[2:23:56] us
[2:23:57] then that
[2:23:58] you know uh
[2:24:00] it is not just a slogan
[2:24:03] it's a reality
[2:24:05] and uh and if we would just be prayerful
[2:24:09] and and and keep our mind on the lord
[2:24:12] you will hear god speaking to you
[2:24:15] concerning your everyday life
[2:24:18] you know
[2:24:19] i mean the lord can tell you that you're
[2:24:21] eating too much
[2:24:22] [Music]
[2:24:24] it's not a difficult thing for him to do
[2:24:27] he can tell you well i mean i mean just
[2:24:30] just skip meal this morning
[2:24:32] because i want to have a closer
[2:24:35] fellowship with you
[2:24:37] it's not a difficult thing he can tell
[2:24:39] you which clothes to work
[2:24:44] you know so
[2:24:48] when she when she
[2:24:49] accepted the offer to be taken back home
[2:24:52] in which of course her sister
[2:24:54] came from out of state for this funeral
[2:24:58] and she just wanted to spend time with
[2:24:59] her sister
[2:25:01] you know but for some reason it needs
[2:25:02] fear that
[2:25:04] she should take her back home
[2:25:06] and when she took her back home when she
[2:25:08] got home
[2:25:10] she met
[2:25:12] her grandson
[2:25:14] playing with the other
[2:25:16] little grandson that is a baby
[2:25:19] and and had a knife in his hands
[2:25:23] you know something that could have been
[2:25:26] very horrible
[2:25:28] you know
[2:25:30] i believe his sisters were all playing
[2:25:32] upstairs and didn't even know what was
[2:25:34] happening
[2:25:35] but uh
[2:25:37] i mean the the scene that she described
[2:25:39] to me was very graphic
[2:25:42] and it could have been horrible
[2:25:45] if the lord never had her to step
[2:25:48] through those doors
[2:25:50] the meaning that she stepped through
[2:25:52] those doors
[2:25:54] i believe he was just the hand of the
[2:25:56] lord
[2:25:59] amen
[2:26:02] amen and the lord used that situation
[2:26:05] to be able to
[2:26:07] rescue their home from sharing of blood
[2:26:10] i mean it's just it's just a child
[2:26:12] thing that he's playing with his
[2:26:15] baby brother
[2:26:16] and
[2:26:18] you know and i mean i don't want to to
[2:26:22] go into the rest of faith
[2:26:25] but uh we want to be grateful
[2:26:28] that the angel of the law was on the
[2:26:31] scene
[2:26:35] to be able to
[2:26:38] deliver that home from what will have
[2:26:40] been horrible
[2:26:42] praise the lord
[2:26:44] and then
[2:26:46] got a call from uh
[2:26:49] sister dokas kamor that that's about
[2:26:52] pastor john carmon's daughter
[2:26:55] uh if you remember sometime was that
[2:26:57] last year or
[2:26:59] year before

[2:43:05] to be here with you folks and uh it's
[2:43:08] been a long time coming
[2:43:09] brother
[2:43:10] blattay's been after me i guess about
[2:43:12] six years now
[2:43:14] trying to get the arrangement to get out
[2:43:16] here and
[2:43:17] we're just glad that the lord allowed
[2:43:18] everything to line up all the little
[2:43:20] lights and stars or whatever you want to
[2:43:22] say to light up where we could get here
[2:43:23] but we we thank the lord for the
[2:43:25] opportunity to come and and uh it has
[2:43:28] been a wonderful privilege to be here
[2:43:30] with you i have so enjoyed preaching to
[2:43:32] you folks i just can't begin to explain
[2:43:34] brother juan is a blessed blessed
[2:43:38] individual to get to stand before a
[2:43:40] group of people like this a couple times
[2:43:42] a week my goodness my goodness my
[2:43:44] goodness amen if the rapture takes place
[2:43:47] anywhere surely it's going to take place
[2:43:49] right here first before it goes anywhere
[2:43:50] else
[2:43:54] i'll tell you what's the truth
[2:43:57] i mean some of these services the last
[2:43:59] couple days and i know when i got in the
[2:44:01] car yesterday went back to the room you
[2:44:03] know and and um and several meetings
[2:44:05] like this you know i i may not stand
[2:44:07] around shake hands quite often during
[2:44:08] the meetings i try to get back and get
[2:44:10] right into the bed and rest as much as i
[2:44:11] can and things and i um i was telling
[2:44:14] samantha last night
[2:44:16] she said uh well that went really really
[2:44:18] really well didn't it and i said well
[2:44:20] yeah but
[2:44:21] make the point of saying it's them
[2:44:23] people that brings that message on like
[2:44:25] that you know it's hungry saints that
[2:44:27] bring it out of the preacher it ain't
[2:44:28] got nothing to do with the preacher
[2:44:30] himself but i i was blessed i i was
[2:44:33] laughing friday night i'd hit a little
[2:44:34] point about women with earrings on and
[2:44:36] there was a little lady was in here the
[2:44:38] other night i caught her at the door
[2:44:39] going out and she had earrings go i said
[2:44:42] and here i was picking all over you
[2:44:44] tonight she said it was all right i
[2:44:45] didn't mind i thought
[2:44:47] well praise the lord that's all right
[2:44:49] you know
[2:44:50] yeah so
[2:44:51] that was all right goes to prove you can
[2:44:53] preach truth to people and not everybody
[2:44:55] gets offended like you think they do
[2:44:57] if you convey your heart to them that
[2:44:59] you love them when you're trying to say
[2:45:00] something you know that that's what gets
[2:45:02] across
[2:45:03] and that's what means something to
[2:45:05] people they want to see something real
[2:45:06] they want to see something genuine and
[2:45:08] if you love them they feel it they feel
[2:45:10] it they sure do and so we appreciate the
[2:45:13] lord and i i i just i'm so happy to have
[2:45:15] samantha here with us to do some singing
[2:45:17] and to have her company and uh it's um
[2:45:20] uh she's been my my wing woman wingman
[2:45:23] wing woman she's been about 23 years
[2:45:26] this coming june
[2:45:27] and
[2:45:28] we got married as kids you know
[2:45:38] the difference is you still look like a
[2:45:40] kid
[2:45:42] you still look like you're 19. now me
[2:45:44] bald-headed how do you put up with me
[2:45:46] anyways i don't understand
[2:45:48] but we got married as kids she had just
[2:45:51] turned 19 i had just turned 21 when we
[2:45:53] got married and uh we we've been
[2:45:56] together ever since i actually met her
[2:45:57] when i was 15 preaching brother carol
[2:45:59] the first time and
[2:46:01] i asked her to be my girlfriend and she
[2:46:03] told me no can you believe that
[2:46:07] no i stayed mad about three years
[2:46:10] [Laughter]
[2:46:12] and then when i come back after she went
[2:46:14] and her sister helped her hide behind
[2:46:16] the air conditioning vent she wouldn't
[2:46:18] even let me talk to her
[2:46:20] and i thought all right the game is
[2:46:22] afoot then
[2:46:25] so i chased her down and i made her mine
[2:46:27] hallelujah has she been putting me up
[2:46:30] with putting me up and putting up with
[2:46:32] me
[2:46:36] i tell this about samantha's singing i
[2:46:37] guess almost everywhere i go to people
[2:46:39] that don't know maybe why we do what we
[2:46:41] do like that but we of course it's to be
[2:46:43] a blessing and things but many years ago
[2:46:46] we were before the minister really come
[2:46:47] into the full-time capacity we were
[2:46:49] laying in a bed together just talking
[2:46:51] about the lord and praying a few things
[2:46:52] and
[2:46:53] the prophecy come into the room that
[2:46:56] said that the lord would take her in her
[2:46:58] gift and shake it before the world and
[2:47:00] you know he's done that this little girl
[2:47:02] right here has not only sang on the
[2:47:04] internet went around the world that way
[2:47:05] but she's been in foreign countries with
[2:47:07] me and sang and been a blessing and
[2:47:09] things and so
[2:47:10] i i
[2:47:11] there was a brother here the other night
[2:47:13] i think i was telling brother fryho
[2:47:14] about this brother carol years ago when
[2:47:17] brother was singing that thanks to
[2:47:18] calvary the other night you know there's
[2:47:20] a brother he's going to be with the lord
[2:47:22] now brother carol buddy tate you all
[2:47:23] remember buddy
[2:47:24] so brother carol said they go travel you
[2:47:26] know and they were going down the road
[2:47:28] and said they'd be in a church and there
[2:47:29] wouldn't be nobody clapping their hands
[2:47:31] they'd be dead as midnight nobody would
[2:47:33] grab that guitar and sing thanks to
[2:47:35] calvary they'd be squalling and balling
[2:47:36] because i could preach for a month after
[2:47:38] he got done singing that song
[2:47:40] and i have found that part of what makes
[2:47:42] the ministry of the lord work for me
[2:47:44] like it does comes whenever we sit down
[2:47:47] and sang some songs we just go in these
[2:47:49] churches it seems like it loosens people
[2:47:51] up and relaxes them a little while
[2:47:53] and so i just felt like you know in my
[2:47:56] life i always wanted to be a singer and
[2:47:58] be involved in music and sing and i've
[2:48:00] been a part of quartets and trios and i
[2:48:02] had an opportunity to go into the big
[2:48:04] mainstream part of that when i was a
[2:48:05] teenage boy i used to have a voice a
[2:48:07] tenor voice at crack glass you sisters
[2:48:10] think you were high i'd run you a race
[2:48:11] any day of the week back when i was 19.
[2:48:14] i could crack glass i was a high high
[2:48:16] high tenor you know then big quartets
[2:48:18] that's what they want somebody to get up
[2:48:19] there and really that that big high
[2:48:21] tenor like that and i had an opportunity
[2:48:23] to go out into those things and um the
[2:48:25] lord started dealing with me as a
[2:48:27] teenage boy all right forsake all either
[2:48:29] be a part of that thing or come over
[2:48:31] here and be a part of the ministry and
[2:48:32] serve the bride
[2:48:34] god knowing the desires of my heart that
[2:48:36] how much i love singing i love doing
[2:48:38] singing and love playing music that when
[2:48:40] i got married i had no idea that i'd
[2:48:42] have my own little gospel group with me
[2:48:44] and her
[2:48:45] every time before i preach
[2:48:49] you know what i mean
[2:48:51] i say gospel group but you understand
[2:48:53] what i'm saying my own little version of
[2:48:54] it i guess so
[2:48:56] it's a blessing to have her and i'm
[2:48:57] honored to be able to sing with her and
[2:48:59] uh i call her the little girl with a big
[2:49:01] voice
[2:49:03] amen and she's been a blessing have you
[2:49:05] enjoyed her yeah
[2:49:06] amen wonderful
[2:49:09] praise the lord
[2:49:11] i i hope this is all right and i don't
[2:49:12] mean this to sound like a commercial but
[2:49:14] we we have a a website we have one cd
[2:49:17] and i don't have a digital version of it
[2:49:19] we had problems in the studio uh but if
[2:49:21] you'd like to of course you could you
[2:49:23] could talk to us about it some other
[2:49:24] time if you'd like to get one of the cds
[2:49:26] that we made
[2:49:28] you can go to that website and you can
[2:49:29] order one and the reason i tell people
[2:49:31] this is not to sell it we don't make any
[2:49:34] money off them things that thing's been
[2:49:35] paid off
[2:49:36] some time ago so it's not about making
[2:49:38] the money of it but uh if you can't
[2:49:40] afford one and you would like one the
[2:49:43] whole purpose of me saying this is i
[2:49:44] want you to let me know if you can't
[2:49:46] afford one let me know and it's yours
[2:49:48] and i don't worry about the money of any
[2:49:49] way whatsoever if you really have a need
[2:49:51] and you'd like to get one and uh so we'd
[2:49:54] like to share that with you in that way
[2:49:56] now i don't expect everybody in here to
[2:49:57] have a need now but you know
[2:50:01] but if you did have a need by all means
[2:50:04] and uh if you would like to get one our
[2:50:06] website is called the
[2:50:07] noradsmusic.com the noradsmusic.com you
[2:50:10] look that up or if you just type in
[2:50:11] brother ben norod you'll you'll find it
[2:50:13] down there somewhere or another amen and
[2:50:15] we'd love to uh let you take us home
[2:50:17] with you but this is the easiest way
[2:50:19] it's the cheapest way because if you had
[2:50:21] to take us home you'd have to feed us
[2:50:23] and that's a big deal
[2:50:25] or at least feed me i'll just speak for
[2:50:27] me
[2:50:28] love you friends god bless you very much

[2:51:15] a storm raging high
[2:51:18] the waters around them were troubled
[2:51:22] that night
[2:51:25] fear filled their heart
[2:51:28] and they thought that they would die
[2:51:31] they failed to remember
[2:51:34] that the master was nigh
[2:51:37] he spoke the word
[2:51:40] and the wind all stood still
[2:51:44] even the waters they obeyed his will

[2:52:35] how he walked with men
[2:52:38] he brought light to their darkness
[2:52:41] when their way grew dim
[2:52:44] how great it would be
[2:52:47] to have his step leading mine
[2:52:51] to walk with the master
[2:52:54] all of the time
[2:52:57] but when trials come
[2:53:00] and death seems so nice
[2:53:03] i can call on the master he said i'll
[2:53:07] get there on time
[2:53:13] and my body is in pain
[2:53:16] all i have to do lord
[2:53:23] and why is i worry
[2:53:26] why should i fear
[2:53:29] when the very same jesus
[2:53:33] stays always near
[2:53:36] he lives in my heart
[2:53:39] and he hears when i cry
[2:53:42] i'll call on his name
[2:53:45] till the storm
[2:53:47] passes by

[2:53:55] why should i fear when the very same
[2:53:59] jesus
[2:54:01] stays always near he

[3:07:06] of god
[3:07:07] you know what a privilege it is to be a
[3:07:09] christian today
[3:07:11] somebody asked me one time they said
[3:07:13] well brother ben do you believe it's a
[3:07:16] a privilege to be a believer i said i do
[3:07:18] i said you mean with all of the troubles
[3:07:20] and the problems and the things that
[3:07:22] goes on
[3:07:23] in a christian's life you mean to tell
[3:07:24] me that you would actually believe
[3:07:27] that it's a blessing to be a christian
[3:07:29] i said well i'll answer you this way
[3:07:32] and i love how brother branham said this
[3:07:34] himself when he said in a message called
[3:07:36] why christ speak he said when
[3:07:40] faith
[3:07:41] looks at god's worst
[3:07:44] it still esteems it better
[3:07:47] than the best that the devil can offer
[3:07:51] hallelujah he didn't even look at god's
[3:07:53] best he said if it was god's worst
[3:07:57] hallelujah that's right i i believe it
[3:08:00] with all of my heart all right if you
[3:08:02] got your bible this morning let's turn
[3:08:03] to isaiah chapter 14 verse 12.
[3:08:07] sure appreciate the lord jesus
[3:08:10] amen how wonderful he is today to us
[3:08:14] amen you love him
[3:08:16] and are you happy to be in church
[3:08:18] now you've already been here a long time
[3:08:20] i know that already
[3:08:21] and uh and i know i've been in the bed
[3:08:23] sleeping while you've been in here
[3:08:24] worshiping
[3:08:26] amen but i i don't get no hurry now and
[3:08:28] if you get tired just stand up and shout
[3:08:30] amen and hallelujah that'll help you
[3:08:32] wake up a little bit
[3:08:33] amen won't hurt you at all
[3:08:35] i want to speak to you this morning now
[3:08:36] this may sound like a strange thought
[3:08:38] for what we would call an easter service
[3:08:40] but i just kind of felt like the lord
[3:08:42] had been impressing me to go this
[3:08:44] direction i want to speak to this
[3:08:45] morning on the reason satan fell from
[3:08:46] heaven the reason satan fell from heaven
[3:08:49] isaiah 14 verse 12
[3:08:53] however fallen from heaven o lucifer son
[3:08:55] of the morning
[3:08:56] art thou cut down to the ground which
[3:08:59] did us weak in the nations
[3:09:01] thou hast said in thine heart i will
[3:09:03] ascend into heaven
[3:09:05] i will exalt my throne
[3:09:07] above the stars of god which brother
[3:09:09] brahm tells us is the sons of god of
[3:09:11] course
[3:09:12] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[3:09:14] congregation
[3:09:15] and the sides of the north
[3:09:17] i will ascend above the heights of the
[3:09:19] clouds i will be like
[3:09:22] anybody getting the message yet
[3:09:25] now there's five wills that satan
[3:09:27] expresses in this i will i will i will
[3:09:30] five times just like that
[3:09:31] notice none of this is to bring glory to
[3:09:33] god this is all about his desire and
[3:09:35] what he wants to do
[3:09:36] i will be like the most high how many he
[3:09:39] wants to be like jesus amen
[3:09:41] so does the devil
[3:09:45] satan wants to be god
[3:09:47] just like you do
[3:09:50] right
[3:09:52] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[3:09:55] he said you want the sides of the north
[3:09:57] i'm going to give you the sides of the
[3:09:58] pit
[3:09:59] remember what jesus said he that exalts
[3:10:01] himself shall be a beast
[3:10:04] and then if you go on reading the
[3:10:06] different parts of these verses you're
[3:10:07] going to find out that at some point
[3:10:10] when the devil is when the lord brings
[3:10:12] satan right before the throne of god and
[3:10:14] he's exposed before the saints of god it
[3:10:16] is such a thing that you actually will
[3:10:18] look at the devil and say
[3:10:20] is this the man
[3:10:23] that's right
[3:10:25] i believe we're kind of getting that
[3:10:26] message now
[3:10:28] amen listen to this and god of this evil
[3:10:31] age brother bryan said it was satan's
[3:10:32] ambition to be worshipped like god
[3:10:35] he took two-thirds of the stars of
[3:10:37] heaven and ascended himself above those
[3:10:39] stars and
[3:10:40] preach to them
[3:10:41] and deceive two-thirds of them you see
[3:10:43] it all right now notice that's his
[3:10:44] ambition and now he is ready with his
[3:10:47] careful selected educated bride by his
[3:10:50] own knowledge see all painted up in the
[3:10:52] seat of big buildings big denomination
[3:10:54] and paints of knowledge and theology
[3:10:56] smart intellectual and educated to
[3:10:59] deceive the whole world and become a god
[3:11:03] and that's what he's done
[3:11:06] satan is the worship person of today
[3:11:09] worshiped by millions
[3:11:11] and billions of people
[3:11:14] around the world
[3:11:16] let's pray together
[3:11:18] lord jesus we are so thankful amen as we
[3:11:22] come into your presence by the way of
[3:11:25] our prayers
[3:11:27] lord we heard last night in thy word
[3:11:29] what a powerful force
[3:11:31] that the prayer life of a child of god
[3:11:33] is
[3:11:34] fathers we bow our heads to you today
[3:11:36] we're asking for divine help
[3:11:38] that you will come into the word of the
[3:11:39] lord today and that you will quicken it
[3:11:41] make it alive for us
[3:11:43] for lord jesus thy
[3:11:45] letter is but a dead letter until thou
[3:11:47] anoints it and makes it a living
[3:11:50] article of life to every one of us and i
[3:11:53] pray that you'll take your word today
[3:11:55] and that you will speak to us by that
[3:11:57] word that you'll anoint me as a giver
[3:11:59] and anoint them as a receiver
[3:12:01] lord jesus we can be edified about
[3:12:03] edified by our gathering together and we
[3:12:05] pray that the holy spirit
[3:12:07] will come into this place today
[3:12:10] and meet every need that is amongst the
[3:12:11] body of christ for we ask it in the name
[3:12:14] of jesus christ lord thank you for your

[3:12:18] thank you for your resurrection
[3:12:20] in jesus name we pray amen amen you may
[3:12:23] be seated may the lord bless you
[3:12:26] now don't get nervous i'm only going to
[3:12:28] preach three hours no big deal
[3:12:30] no big deal all right
[3:12:32] we got all afternoon my plane don't
[3:12:34] leave till 8 o'clock i got plenty of
[3:12:36] time
[3:12:38] i want to talk to you just a little bit
[3:12:39] in the beginning because i want to give
[3:12:40] you a picture of where i'm going to try
[3:12:42] to go
[3:12:43] and um
[3:12:44] hopefully if i can get to where i'd like
[3:12:46] to get to
[3:12:47] i want to try to show you about the
[3:12:49] great deception
[3:12:50] of this last day
[3:12:52] that as we know comes by religion
[3:12:56] don't forget that
[3:12:58] every deceitful thing that will be
[3:13:00] manifested in this last day will come by
[3:13:02] the medium of religion
[3:13:05] satan is not a drunk
[3:13:07] satan is not a scoundrel that uh uh you
[3:13:10] know this uh his primary objective is is
[3:13:13] to
[3:13:14] destroy lives through alcohol whiskey
[3:13:16] drugs these type of things like that but
[3:13:19] satan's main objective is to pull people
[3:13:21] in through the means of religion
[3:13:24] remember that satan was created to be a
[3:13:28] religious being
[3:13:30] and when the devil was first spoke into
[3:13:32] existence as we looked at friday night
[3:13:34] about those angels of the lord he was
[3:13:36] made of such a high quality that brother
[3:13:39] venom identifies to us that he was
[3:13:41] everything that god was except for
[3:13:44] a creator so what was interesting about
[3:13:47] that particular remark was
[3:13:49] didn't the devil see
[3:13:51] whenever god had created him that he had
[3:13:54] created him with all the same
[3:13:55] characteristics or the same abilities as
[3:13:58] what god had minus the creation part and
[3:14:02] yet somehow that wasn't good enough for
[3:14:04] the devil and that's a surprising thing
[3:14:06] in a way you imagine if you was a leader
[3:14:09] of this nation here and like mr biden if
[3:14:11] you'd have made vice president sometimes
[3:14:14] you know for some folks you think well
[3:14:15] that's good enough i got almost to the
[3:14:17] top but the way that a person with a
[3:14:19] certain type of ambition tends to behave
[3:14:22] is that
[3:14:23] they they don't really you know want to
[3:14:24] be just the second in charge or they
[3:14:26] don't want to be just you know kind of a
[3:14:28] subordinate to somebody but in their
[3:14:31] mind they want to be the very top guy
[3:14:33] the very main one so satan looked at all
[3:14:36] of the arrangement in heaven and saw
[3:14:38] that he was always going to be a servant
[3:14:41] to almighty god he saw that he would
[3:14:43] always be in the realm and the position
[3:14:46] of servitude and there was something
[3:14:48] about that that irritated and rubbed the
[3:14:50] devil the wrong way because we know that
[3:14:53] at some point we know because satan was
[3:14:55] created with free moral agency that at
[3:14:58] some point there must have been kind of
[3:15:00] a buzzer or a bell or something clicked
[3:15:01] inside of it went off and said you know
[3:15:03] what i'm tired of the way this all looks
[3:15:06] i'm tired
[3:15:07] of of the arrangement of this
[3:15:09] i want to do things my way and i want to
[3:15:12] call the shots now remember sin itself
[3:15:16] comes in degrees now you know i know
[3:15:18] what i'm saying before that satan's not
[3:15:20] all about whiskey and drugs and these
[3:15:22] things i know the devil is in those
[3:15:24] things but it is the difference between
[3:15:26] his primary objectives and his primary
[3:15:29] targets versus all the other little
[3:15:31] things that accompanies his original
[3:15:33] deception because remember when satan
[3:15:36] deceived in the very beginning although
[3:15:38] it was the sexual act that followed
[3:15:41] along afterwards an immorality between
[3:15:44] the serpent and eve and even though
[3:15:46] there was a perversion of the flesh and
[3:15:48] the body and a hybriding together
[3:15:50] between the serpent and eve remember
[3:15:52] that was not the tool that satan used to
[3:15:54] get to her the tool that he used was in
[3:15:57] the realm of religion taking what god
[3:15:59] had said and trying to break that down
[3:16:02] to her in his own interpretation to say
[3:16:05] now the lord has said yeah you should
[3:16:07] eat of every fruit of the tree of the
[3:16:08] garden but you know eve god is trying to
[3:16:10] hide something from you he's trying to
[3:16:12] keep you know a greater purpose from you
[3:16:14] no doubt that probably was the message
[3:16:16] that he said to all of them angels when
[3:16:18] he pulled a third of them out of heaven
[3:16:20] to be able to say well you know really
[3:16:22] uh you know god you know he he's got
[3:16:24] this whole arrangement and
[3:16:26] and and look at how you are uh like
[3:16:28] you'd say the angels of the lord would
[3:16:30] be on a ten point scale uh this certain
[3:16:32] angel you're just a two but you come
[3:16:34] join me and you come follow me and i'll
[3:16:36] make you an eight i'll make you a seven
[3:16:38] i'll make you this or make you that you
[3:16:40] know that's the thing about the devil
[3:16:42] he's always making promises that he
[3:16:44] never intends to keep
[3:16:47] he's the type of being that will
[3:16:49] convince you or talk you into robbing a
[3:16:51] bank and then call the law on you after
[3:16:53] you rob it
[3:16:56] and he never shows the entire picture
[3:16:58] always remember that the devil will
[3:17:00] always hold back a portion of what he is
[3:17:03] thinking of what he is feeling and what
[3:17:06] he desires after to keep you from
[3:17:08] understanding what is real motive and
[3:17:11] objective is
[3:17:14] i want to say something here right now
[3:17:16] on a natural side
[3:17:18] we got a lot of young sisters in here
[3:17:20] and i see a few brothers scattered
[3:17:21] around here amen brother one's going to
[3:17:24] have to start preaching that scripture a
[3:17:25] man leave father and mother and cling to
[3:17:27] his wife or y'all ain't going to have
[3:17:28] nobody after a while
[3:17:30] all these girls get married off
[3:17:32] by like manchester we had 12 girls to
[3:17:34] one boy down there you know
[3:17:36] but anyhow you know the holy spirit
[3:17:39] might use this remark that i'm going to
[3:17:41] make to maybe give you an understanding
[3:17:43] of how to protect your virtue
[3:17:45] when it comes and even boys on the other
[3:17:47] side women can be just as deceitful as
[3:17:48] man can in this way but you know you
[3:17:50] take a boy and maybe he starts courting
[3:17:52] you he'll tell you how beautiful you are
[3:17:54] and how much better you are than
[3:17:56] everybody else and you're the only woman
[3:17:58] for him and he's only got eyes for you
[3:18:00] and this sort of thing usually if they
[3:18:02] have the agenda of wanting to uh come
[3:18:05] together in an intimate manner and
[3:18:07] that's their only purpose and all of
[3:18:09] that kind of talk like that you can
[3:18:11] pretty well
[3:18:13] pick it out of a crowd almost and tell
[3:18:15] by the characteristics of it simply
[3:18:17] because it is always about the
[3:18:19] flatteries and always about you know the
[3:18:22] flowery type thing like that this is why
[3:18:24] the bible said to be careful of
[3:18:26] flatteries like that not that telling
[3:18:29] somebody that you know i like the way
[3:18:31] you're dressed like your shirt like your
[3:18:32] tie what a great singer what a great
[3:18:34] musician what a great whatever you might
[3:18:35] be uh you know i like the way you sow i
[3:18:37] like the way you cook you know those
[3:18:39] aren't what the bible would identify as
[3:18:41] flatteries but flatteries are when they
[3:18:44] have an agenda for all of those nice
[3:18:46] words that are coming out of their mouth
[3:18:48] and they've got an ulterior motive back
[3:18:50] behind all of those words
[3:18:53] if you want to marry somebody marry
[3:18:55] somebody that ain't afraid to disagree
[3:18:56] with you
[3:18:58] marry somebody that's not afraid to rub
[3:19:00] you the wrong way
[3:19:02] find you somebody that's willing to butt
[3:19:04] heads with you a little bit
[3:19:06] well hallelujah
[3:19:08] because that's the stuff that happy
[3:19:10] marriages are made of
[3:19:12] you're not always going to agree one
[3:19:14] with another you're not always going to
[3:19:15] see eye to eye and just imagine if you
[3:19:18] met this boy and he was absolutely
[3:19:21] perfect and agreed with every word you
[3:19:23] said you better watch that grasshopper
[3:19:25] right there
[3:19:28] [Applause]
[3:19:29] vice versa boys if she follows you
[3:19:32] around she's got a shrine built to you
[3:19:34] in her room and he is the greatest that
[3:19:37] oh everything he says is right his feet
[3:19:39] are so cute he smells so good
[3:19:42] you better run like she's got ebola
[3:19:47] [Music]
[3:19:50] amen
[3:19:52] yes sir i don't care how beautiful she
[3:19:54] might be i don't care how nice or pretty
[3:19:57] or whatever it might be there's
[3:19:58] something wrong with that behavior
[3:20:02] even the bible tells us steel on steel
[3:20:05] sharpens your brother
[3:20:07] amen we're not always going to agree
[3:20:08] with everything there's always going to
[3:20:10] be areas in your life when you meet the
[3:20:12] one that god really has ordained for you
[3:20:14] they will sometimes sharpen you in ways
[3:20:16] you didn't know you need to be sharpened
[3:20:18] that's right
[3:20:19] amen let me tell you something and some
[3:20:21] of you boys walking around here that
[3:20:22] don't know how to hold the door open for
[3:20:24] some of these sisters around here just
[3:20:26] get married one time to a good
[3:20:27] old-fashioned country girl
[3:20:30] amen the one that's not afraid to bite
[3:20:32] your kneecaps if it means if the need
[3:20:34] presents itself and i'll tell you right
[3:20:36] now if you wasn't raised in a
[3:20:38] gentleman-like manner to hold the door
[3:20:40] open for sisters you just let that thing
[3:20:41] slam on her a few times and find out if
[3:20:44] you don't hear about it
[3:20:47] now i'm teasing samantha you know but i
[3:20:49] i was never raised that way i always
[3:20:51] hold the door for sisters thing like
[3:20:52] that but her brother now on the other
[3:20:54] hand he would go walking through a door
[3:20:56] and slam right behind right and samantha
[3:20:58] would tear him limb from them don't you
[3:21:00] know that's a woman that's a lady open
[3:21:02] the door you lazy thing
[3:21:07] poor old chris don't let him hear this
[3:21:09] message
[3:21:11] he my buddy
[3:21:12] amen but it sharpens you it lets you
[3:21:14] know there are areas of your life where
[3:21:16] you need to straighten up
[3:21:18] you say but i don't want to marry nobody
[3:21:19] like that that's the kind you probably
[3:21:21] need then
[3:21:24] you don't need somebody that being a yes
[3:21:26] man or a yes woman
[3:21:28] you need somebody that's willing to
[3:21:29] stand up to you from time to time
[3:21:31] and tell you that you're wrong and that
[3:21:32] you need to get the things straightened
[3:21:34] out that's right
[3:21:36] oh praise the lord oh i know that runs
[3:21:39] down into men too whenever they find
[3:21:40] that sweet little young thing and oh
[3:21:42] she's so beautiful they're scared to
[3:21:44] death that she'll run away and leave
[3:21:45] them
[3:21:46] so they never correct her they never
[3:21:48] speak up and never tell her how in the
[3:21:49] world did i get on this
[3:21:54] where did this come from
[3:21:57] oh ulterior motives okay i remember
[3:21:59] where we was at amen and you understand
[3:22:01] that there's a reason why that people do
[3:22:04] the things they do when you know when
[3:22:06] you buy a house or or you're trying to
[3:22:08] buy a car watch how nice that salesman
[3:22:10] is to you if he thinks you've got the
[3:22:11] money to buy a car
[3:22:13] just look at him one time and say you
[3:22:15] can't afford it
[3:22:18] and watch how much of a knock buddy he
[3:22:20] is
[3:22:22] i mean you walk in there and you are
[3:22:24] flat broke i remember one time we was
[3:22:25] trying to buy a refrigerator and
[3:22:27] something had i had great credit i
[3:22:29] didn't have any issues with credit had
[3:22:31] the cash at the home to buy the crazy
[3:22:32] thing but they was going to give me two
[3:22:34] years without any kind of interest in
[3:22:35] that i can't i thought i'm going to jump
[3:22:37] on that we went up to the register and
[3:22:38] this guy oh man you know i can tell
[3:22:40] you're an all right guy boy you know
[3:22:42] your stuff and boy you're smart look at
[3:22:45] that pretty wife of yours look how
[3:22:46] handsome oh you're a good happening
[3:22:48] couple the minute the thing went defunct
[3:22:50] and then it buzzed back that he couldn't
[3:22:53] give me the credit he literally turned
[3:22:55] his back on me and said one of them i
[3:22:57] figured anyhow
[3:23:02] ulterior motives that's the way the
[3:23:04] devil operates
[3:23:06] he operates in a manner that as long as
[3:23:09] you're petting the kitty this way yes
[3:23:12] that's right everything is fine that's
[3:23:14] right
[3:23:14] that's how you know brother sister
[3:23:16] whether you're dealing with a real
[3:23:17] christian or dealing with a faker
[3:23:20] because if you want to know if a man or
[3:23:22] woman is a real believer just rake him
[3:23:24] with that word one time
[3:23:26] preach the gospel in a manner and you
[3:23:28] know how people are well he looked right
[3:23:30] at me when he said that
[3:23:33] where am i supposed to look
[3:23:36] [Music]
[3:23:38] praise the lord
[3:23:39] [Applause]
[3:23:40] i can preach to the drums hey drums get
[3:23:43] saved but there's nothing in them drums
[3:23:44] to get saved
[3:23:46] but you can
[3:23:47] i figure i might as well preach to you
[3:23:51] you can watch people when the word gets
[3:23:53] hot
[3:23:54] kind of like it did last night
[3:23:56] some of you were on your feet glory to
[3:23:58] god then i hit that little part about
[3:24:00] holding things in your heart
[3:24:02] and it was so quiet i thought we'd turn
[3:24:04] into the methodist there for about 10
[3:24:05] minutes
[3:24:07] how about my lord where'd all that
[3:24:09] pentecost go
[3:24:11] but you know after the word goes forth
[3:24:13] and you see it and you begin to repent
[3:24:15] and you just keep moving on with the
[3:24:17] lord that is an indication that you are
[3:24:20] made of stuff that the devil can't run
[3:24:22] out of here
[3:24:24] [Music]
[3:24:26] even jesus tried to offend him
[3:24:29] he had a bunch of what brother branham
[3:24:31] called parasites hanging on his ministry
[3:24:35] and jesus turned and said what would you
[3:24:36] say if you see the son of man standing
[3:24:39] here in angels and descending and
[3:24:40] ascending upon him
[3:24:42] what did i tell you eat the flesh of the
[3:24:44] son of man drink his blood
[3:24:46] and then but
[3:24:48] did you hear what he said
[3:24:52] and the whole time the lord jesus is
[3:24:54] going uh-huh
[3:24:56] take the bait come on
[3:24:58] come on take the bait
[3:25:00] because brother bradham said he knew he
[3:25:02] had too many following his ministry that
[3:25:04] wasn't really committed to him
[3:25:06] they were there for fishes and loaves
[3:25:09] ulterior
[3:25:11] motives
[3:25:12] preachers can have this type of thing in
[3:25:14] the platform be careful of a man that
[3:25:17] will preach to you and always have
[3:25:19] something nice to say
[3:25:22] better watch a dude like that
[3:25:24] because if he never willing to offend
[3:25:26] you
[3:25:26] then you've got the wrong kind of man in
[3:25:28] the platform
[3:25:29] [Music]
[3:25:31] that's right
[3:25:33] real preachers aren't afraid to hurt
[3:25:34] your feelings i mean the real ones not
[3:25:37] these fakers
[3:25:38] real ones are not all about the fluff
[3:25:40] preaching and getting you excited and
[3:25:42] getting you running around the building
[3:25:44] sometimes a real man of god digs a deep
[3:25:47] it grieves him
[3:25:50] i've been in positions where my flesh
[3:25:52] was actually i could feel i could feel
[3:25:54] myself shivering from fear because i was
[3:25:56] getting so hard with the people and the
[3:25:58] holy ghost standing and said drive it
[3:25:59] drive it preach it
[3:26:02] amen but a real servant of god ain't
[3:26:05] afraid to butt heads with you from time
[3:26:07] to time
[3:26:08] and if you get mad and blow up and run
[3:26:10] out it goes to prove what was inside of
[3:26:12] you
[3:26:14] oh you say well that preacher should be
[3:26:15] nice to me don't he know how many ties i
[3:26:17] pay like that's got to do with anything
[3:26:20] i mean i you know if it was a matter of
[3:26:22] seniority okay so who started here first
[3:26:25] who started second uh let's get the list
[3:26:27] and the unionization down and get
[3:26:28] everybody on a pecking order
[3:26:32] and so we'll have church and shifts you
[3:26:34] know so the main charter members the
[3:26:36] main ones you know been in the message
[3:26:37] the longest and those type of people uh
[3:26:39] you get one type of sermon and then
[3:26:41] we'll bring the younger ones in they get
[3:26:42] another type of sermon
[3:26:46] y'all getting quieter and quieter
[3:26:49] because you see the word of god is
[3:26:51] applicable to everybody
[3:26:56] did you ever notice
[3:26:58] that the message has no gender
[3:27:02] the message has no color
[3:27:05] right
[3:27:06] the message applies to everybody
[3:27:12] i'm going somewhere in just a minute but
[3:27:14] i got to get you there easy going
[3:27:19] remember when adam was
[3:27:21] first identified as a sinner in the
[3:27:22] garden of eden he was a direct
[3:27:24] descendant from god
[3:27:27] and when his boy broke that word god
[3:27:29] looked at him and said get out
[3:27:32] god never played favorites god had no
[3:27:35] prejudice
[3:27:37] it come to the word it was yay and a man
[3:27:39] or it wasn't yes that's right even his
[3:27:42] own son
[3:27:44] he spared no expense
[3:27:46] he spared no shots no mercy he gave no
[3:27:49] excuses
[3:27:51] when adam broke the word of god he said
[3:27:53] why have you done this thing
[3:27:58] but satan always makes a way
[3:28:02] there's always some kind of little
[3:28:04] hidden agenda
[3:28:06] to give you a scapegoat and
[3:28:08] out this is why that
[3:28:11] politically correct preaching is so
[3:28:13] popular these days
[3:28:15] could you imagine the lord jesus
[3:28:18] standing right now in this day and age
[3:28:21] preaching the things that he did to the
[3:28:22] pharisees on an international broadcast
[3:28:25] with the world listening to him
[3:28:27] when he turned and looked at a woman and
[3:28:29] called her a dog
[3:28:31] you realize that was a racial slur
[3:28:34] she was a seraphine a hybrid
[3:28:36] and they called them dogs back then
[3:28:39] could you imagine what they would have
[3:28:40] thought about jesus
[3:28:42] probably the same thing they think about
[3:28:43] brother brad i'm going to call women dog
[3:28:44] meat for wearing makeup
[3:28:48] the message is not politically correct
[3:28:50] friends
[3:28:52] nor was it ever intended to be
[3:28:56] it's a line of demarcation
[3:28:58] the prophet of god praised good women
[3:29:01] didn't he
[3:29:03] he praised sisters that lived right
[3:29:05] lived holy
[3:29:07] but when it come to the ones that didn't
[3:29:08] he made it so straight and so plain
[3:29:11] that when you read them books and you
[3:29:13] listen to the message of the hour there
[3:29:15] is no doubt in your mind which woman is
[3:29:17] which
[3:29:21] there's no gray
[3:29:23] there's no blending
[3:29:25] there's no well i you know
[3:29:28] well you know i could be a sister and i
[3:29:30] could still do dot dot i can be a
[3:29:32] brother
[3:29:34] when you read this message you can't do
[3:29:35] that
[3:29:37] it is very very
[3:29:39] transparent
[3:29:42] oh listen to me church
[3:29:44] but when the devil begins to
[3:29:46] preach there's always this air of
[3:29:50] everybody can do it right
[3:29:54] now you watch and see if that same
[3:29:56] denominational trend that you see out in
[3:29:58] the world has not followed us right here
[3:30:00] around the ranks of this message that's
[3:30:02] right
[3:30:03] everybody is bride if you've got a bunch
[3:30:05] of books and tapes or whatever more we
[3:30:07] don't have tapes anymore this day we got
[3:30:09] our tablets and whatever more and and if
[3:30:11] you've got an identity of brother
[3:30:13] branham if you've got an identity with
[3:30:15] the message you're all right you're on
[3:30:16] your way to that rapture and you are
[3:30:18] ready to go
[3:30:21] same thing that balaam preached
[3:30:24] we're all one
[3:30:25] no we're not
[3:30:31] there are those that are called of god
[3:30:34] amen with their name on the book before
[3:30:37] the foundation of the world
[3:30:40] and there are those that are ordained to
[3:30:42] hell
[3:30:47] you say well that's awful strong well
[3:30:49] what about judas
[3:30:50] the bible called him the son of
[3:30:52] perdition before he was even born look
[3:30:54] that word perditioned up sometime in the
[3:30:56] original greek you'll find out it's the
[3:30:58] word hell
[3:30:59] he was a son of hell before he was even
[3:31:01] born
[3:31:02] this is why the prophet said he came
[3:31:04] from hell and he went back to hell
[3:31:07] when judas preached the gospel he said
[3:31:09] the devil preached the gospel when judas
[3:31:12] got baptized the devil got baptized
[3:31:20] so it's this religion of we're all the
[3:31:22] same
[3:31:24] we all believe the same message
[3:31:27] shouldn't we all be one at what point
[3:31:30] does god call separation
[3:31:35] if we're all the same and all of us are
[3:31:37] going to the same heaven and this one
[3:31:40] hates that one and these ain't
[3:31:43] come on
[3:31:45] these don't live right these have got
[3:31:46] every excuse in the world for why they
[3:31:47] can't live right that's right they
[3:31:49] barely come to church they paid a tithe
[3:31:51] in a hundred years
[3:31:55] i can't afford to pay tithes you can't
[3:31:56] afford not to
[3:31:59] god called you to pay those tithes and
[3:32:00] those offers not because god needs your
[3:32:02] money but because it is a testament that
[3:32:05] you will take your portion and give it
[3:32:07] to god
[3:32:08] [Music]
[3:32:09] right he said if you'll do it he'll
[3:32:10] bless you in a lot of ways
[3:32:12] he won't bless you and just open bank
[3:32:14] accounts and pour money in it he'll
[3:32:16] bless you with peace he'll bless you the
[3:32:18] prayer life he said i won't allow your
[3:32:20] leaf to wither nor will it dry up and
[3:32:23] neither will your fig not cast
[3:32:25] hallelujah
[3:32:28] once we follow the program of god the
[3:32:30] floodgates open up on us so we can bless
[3:32:32] him and live for him and work like we're
[3:32:34] supposed to work as christians
[3:32:38] but how is it satan has been so great
[3:32:42] at blending together these spirits
[3:32:45] you said but brother being brother
[3:32:46] branham said this message would never
[3:32:48] become an organization you're right
[3:32:50] the message itself can't
[3:32:53] the more i study this truth hallelujah
[3:32:56] the more i just it just keeps unfolding
[3:32:58] and unfolding and unfolding
[3:33:02] but you see the message is not the
[3:33:03] people that follow us
[3:33:04] [Music]
[3:33:08] i know you're listening to me
[3:33:11] i know you're hearing what i'm saying
[3:33:14] but also be willing to open up your eyes
[3:33:16] and look around your own ranks and see
[3:33:18] what's taking place amongst us
[3:33:21] when you've got people that'll come in
[3:33:22] and say well do you believe god sent a
[3:33:23] prophet just raise up your hand ah
[3:33:25] there's the baptist
[3:33:28] when they come to a place no more altar
[3:33:30] calls ah now you got the nazarenes the
[3:33:32] presbyterians and the rest of them
[3:33:36] when they want to preach all the word
[3:33:38] and never preach the blood now you're at
[3:33:40] the methodist stage
[3:33:42] denominational spirits
[3:33:46] and satan has so ordained things and
[3:33:49] organized things
[3:33:51] until the devil has slipped right into
[3:33:54] the ranks of this message
[3:33:57] and anointed men to preach things to the
[3:34:00] people that were all one
[3:34:03] well you believe the message don't you
[3:34:06] anybody ever ask the devil if he
[3:34:07] believes it
[3:34:09] yeah right
[3:34:11] because he does
[3:34:13] do you know the devil don't even believe
[3:34:14] his own trinitarian doctrine
[3:34:18] he tells people that there are three but
[3:34:20] the bible said he believes there's one
[3:34:25] satan don't even believe his own
[3:34:27] trinitarian doctrine
[3:34:30] and remember he's not a trinity nor is
[3:34:32] he a trinity
[3:34:34] he's one
[3:34:37] how did the devil get to such a place
[3:34:40] to where that he could get a foothold
[3:34:43] on the people around the ranks of this
[3:34:45] message
[3:34:47] brother madam teaches us that it is a
[3:34:49] bride war glory
[3:34:52] remember what he said about
[3:34:54] this great clash that come
[3:34:57] i i love this remark
[3:35:00] when he's speaking about satan and how
[3:35:02] that he preached he goes back to ezekiel
[3:35:05] chapter 28 and he picks up verse 14 when
[3:35:08] he said thou art the anointed champ
[3:35:13] now brother you think you've heard good
[3:35:14] preachers
[3:35:16] the devil is one of the most charismatic
[3:35:18] and anointed speakers
[3:35:20] that you will ever listen to
[3:35:22] he has got charisma he's got ability
[3:35:27] he'll capture your attention that's
[3:35:28] right
[3:35:29] and you will set mesmerized
[3:35:32] while you listen
[3:35:34] at one of satan's
[3:35:36] ministers you say how can you say such a
[3:35:39] thing the bible said it
[3:35:40] paul said that satan could be
[3:35:43] transformed into the angel of light
[3:35:46] but he also said if satan's ministers
[3:35:48] could be transformed also into the
[3:35:50] apostles of christ there is a true
[3:35:53] fivefold
[3:35:55] but there's also imposters in that
[3:35:57] right
[3:36:00] if a true teacher will bring you to a
[3:36:02] true birth
[3:36:04] then a false teacher will bring you to a
[3:36:05] false one that's right god i hope
[3:36:07] somebody's hearing me
[3:36:11] this is why that we must have the
[3:36:13] anointing of the holy ghost and
[3:36:15] discernment of the spirit
[3:36:20] because the prophet said wisdom versus
[3:36:21] faith i've seen demons speak in tongues
[3:36:25] i've seen devils prophesy
[3:36:29] satan can work every anointed gift
[3:36:32] that's in the body of christ
[3:36:36] yeah well i'll just take my bible with
[3:36:38] him he also said this
[3:36:40] satan knows the word better than any of
[3:36:41] us
[3:36:42] he said he knows it from a
[3:36:45] to z
[3:36:50] you think you're going to get into a
[3:36:51] battle of quotes with such a being
[3:36:54] as i told you friday night
[3:36:56] there's a difference in you and i that
[3:36:57] read it
[3:36:58] this is a man that stood there when it
[3:37:00] was being spoken
[3:37:02] and isaiah said a virgin shall conceive
[3:37:05] the devil was standing right there
[3:37:07] listen
[3:37:10] he has such an ability
[3:37:13] of deception also watch that he wanted
[3:37:16] to be so much like god
[3:37:18] that he took unto him a bride now when
[3:37:22] you look at this in revelation chapter
[3:37:23] 17 and you see that great pardon
[3:37:26] that sisters that great horse standing
[3:37:28] on sitting on the throne with many
[3:37:30] waters and so forth beneath her just
[3:37:32] remember that what you are looking at at
[3:37:34] one time was a virgin bride
[3:37:38] a virgin bride to jesus christ that
[3:37:42] eventually gave her sir womb over
[3:37:45] to the seed of discrepancy
[3:37:51] paul said i fear
[3:37:54] i've espoused you to jesus christ but i
[3:37:56] fear
[3:37:59] that satan and his subtility
[3:38:02] as he did eve
[3:38:04] why in the world would paul identify eve
[3:38:07] if she wasn't significant
[3:38:08] and friends let's just be plain about
[3:38:10] something
[3:38:11] eve was guilty of committing adultery
[3:38:13] not eating some kind of a fruit
[3:38:15] the punishment shows what kind of crime
[3:38:17] she committed
[3:38:18] because when god come down to cursor
[3:38:20] what did he curse her by in conception
[3:38:22] and sorrow you'll bring forth
[3:38:25] if she would have ate some kind of a
[3:38:27] fruit why didn't god give her a lunch
[3:38:28] jaw
[3:38:33] he punished her the area she was guilty
[3:38:35] in
[3:38:36] also notice the words of the lord jesus
[3:38:39] and john standing on the river jordan
[3:38:41] whenever he goes to talking about those
[3:38:43] evil pharisees and them demonic spirits
[3:38:45] that was all bottled up in them evil men
[3:38:47] of that day watch what he said ah you
[3:38:50] generation of vipers
[3:38:53] of all the animals he could have chosen
[3:38:54] the animal kingdom why a viper
[3:38:56] why did he say ah you're you generation
[3:38:58] of chimpanzees
[3:39:01] right ah your generation of rhinoceros
[3:39:05] why did he call him vipers because he
[3:39:06] knew where the original sin had taken
[3:39:07] place
[3:39:08] [Music]
[3:39:11] now paul is making a parallel
[3:39:14] and showing us glory to god that just as
[3:39:17] eve gave her womb over to the seat of
[3:39:19] discrepancy so is it going to happen
[3:39:23] again amen
[3:39:26] and so this great woman that john
[3:39:28] admires with admiration
[3:39:31] she has become a bride pregnated by
[3:39:34] satan's seed
[3:39:36] how do we know that she's received seed
[3:39:38] from the devil look at what she's
[3:39:40] producing
[3:39:42] baptist presbyterian those are
[3:39:43] blasphemous names
[3:39:46] identify yourself as even message you
[3:39:48] better be careful with that
[3:39:50] because they didn't call message
[3:39:52] believers at antioch they were called
[3:39:53] christians at antioch
[3:39:56] we got to a place where we use that
[3:39:57] moniker as almost like a tag like a
[3:39:59] baptist or a methodist or a presbyterian
[3:40:01] oh i believe the message i didn't ask
[3:40:03] you that i want to know are you a
[3:40:05] christian full of the holy ghost
[3:40:07] [Music]
[3:40:09] amen
[3:40:12] so how is the seed of the word sown it
[3:40:14] is sown to the preaching of the gospel
[3:40:18] so just as you said here my captive
[3:40:20] little audience
[3:40:23] and i'm taking this word of god and i'm
[3:40:25] preaching and i'm spreading it out like
[3:40:26] a sower
[3:40:28] sowing seed out to
[3:40:30] you and as brother ben taught us your
[3:40:33] mind is the womb to your spirit as is
[3:40:35] the womb to your soul
[3:40:38] and if you receive what i'm telling you
[3:40:40] and i tell you something that's my idea
[3:40:42] or my thought you see what kind of
[3:40:44] trouble i could be in and what kind of
[3:40:45] condition i can put you in
[3:40:47] this is why preachers can be the most
[3:40:49] blessed people or the most dangerous
[3:40:51] people you'll ever know
[3:40:54] because once they get influence over an
[3:40:56] audience
[3:40:57] poorly old sheep that don't have the
[3:40:59] ability to discern sometimes between
[3:41:01] good and evil
[3:41:02] because a man's got charisma he knows
[3:41:04] how to kick his leg out and scream at
[3:41:06] the right moments and get everybody
[3:41:08] feeling a certain way brother i love all
[3:41:10] of that i'm a charismatic man myself but
[3:41:12] you better watch what he's saying about
[3:41:14] that word
[3:41:18] no matter how much of a deep teacher
[3:41:20] they are
[3:41:21] how many of our people through the years
[3:41:23] have been deceived by the greatest
[3:41:24] teachers that we've ever saw grace the
[3:41:26] field god bless you they know how to
[3:41:29] speak they know how to hold themselves
[3:41:30] they know how to gesture just at the
[3:41:32] right moment
[3:41:33] send chills down your body oh what a
[3:41:36] speaker
[3:41:37] but you better watch brother because if
[3:41:39] you're sawing that seed of discrepancy
[3:41:41] in your mind
[3:41:42] the only thing that will stop it is the
[3:41:44] grace of god and the seal of god on your
[3:41:46] soul is the only thing that will keep
[3:41:47] you from going father
[3:41:49] amen that's why the elected cannot be
[3:41:51] deceived
[3:41:53] because their womb is already stopped up
[3:41:56] [Music]
[3:41:58] they cannot receive anything contract
[3:42:01] they cannot be impregnated by the devil
[3:42:03] they've already been seed bearing people
[3:42:06] of the word of god
[3:42:11] so satan has a war a foot let's turn to
[3:42:14] second timothy chapter three verse one
[3:42:16] now i quoted this to you that night but
[3:42:18] let's look at it again just to get a
[3:42:19] context of what we're talking about
[3:42:23] oh praise the lord
[3:42:25] everybody all right
[3:42:27] everybody got their shots and their
[3:42:29] heart pills and
[3:42:32] hey breakfast my blood sugar doing okay
[3:42:35] okay okay just check and make sure
[3:42:36] everybody's all right
[3:42:39] ii timothy chapter 3 verse 1
[3:42:42] i know this is heavy duty stuff but let
[3:42:44] me tell you something brother this will
[3:42:45] help us if we listen to it
[3:42:47] sure it will this know also the last
[3:42:49] days perilous dangerous times shall come
[3:42:54] men shall be lovers of their own self
[3:42:56] watch now covetous boosters proud
[3:42:58] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[3:43:00] unthankful unholy
[3:43:02] unthankful
[3:43:05] where am i seeing that in church oh i
[3:43:07] don't know holy ghost moving all over
[3:43:08] the building people shouting praising
[3:43:10] the lord and some little guys sitting
[3:43:11] over the corner in the middle of the
[3:43:12] church or wherever you might be
[3:43:21] sure
[3:43:23] they look at you why do you rejoice like
[3:43:25] you do because i have a spirit of
[3:43:27] thankfulness on me
[3:43:30] i'm like that little hog that's been
[3:43:31] eating apples and i look up to see where
[3:43:33] the apples come from
[3:43:37] instead of getting a belly full of not
[3:43:38] paying attention to it i look up
[3:43:41] so to you if you're a real worshiper
[3:43:44] but do you understand why the devil
[3:43:46] hates your godly worship
[3:43:48] because he wanted to worship himself
[3:43:52] do you understand what a slap in the
[3:43:53] face it is to that enemy yeah whenever
[3:43:55] you walk into this place and you are
[3:43:57] you're on your job or where you don't
[3:43:58] have to be here to worship god and you
[3:44:00] don't have to just be doing that to
[3:44:01] worship the lord
[3:44:03] but do you realize when you live an
[3:44:05] everyday life of such commitment to the
[3:44:06] lord that your life is an everyday
[3:44:09] ongoing spirit of worship and
[3:44:11] gratefulness and gratitude and
[3:44:13] thanksgiving and then you come to church
[3:44:14] in your glory to god and hallelujah and
[3:44:17] praise the lord don't you know how mad
[3:44:20] that makes the devil
[3:44:24] glory
[3:44:25] there's an old song we sing he's mad and
[3:44:27] i'm glad
[3:44:28] and i'm going on with jesus just to say
[3:44:33] praise heart
[3:44:36] right
[3:44:38] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[3:44:40] pleasure more than lovers of
[3:44:42] god oh brother being the world's a bad
[3:44:45] bunch of people oh don't stop reading
[3:44:48] having a form of godliness
[3:44:52] but denying the power thereof
[3:44:54] from such turn away
[3:44:57] so they have enough in them that they
[3:44:58] can identify the godly part
[3:45:01] but they don't want the power
[3:45:07] it's kind of like people nowadays they
[3:45:08] want a turnkey house
[3:45:10] but they don't want to have to put the
[3:45:12] work in that it takes to get a turnkey
[3:45:14] house
[3:45:15] you know what i mean by turnkey house
[3:45:16] one of them show houses it's all done up
[3:45:18] and hardwood flooring and a whole bit
[3:45:20] people want things they want that nice
[3:45:22] beautiful you know bmw or whatever it
[3:45:25] might be they want to pour so they want
[3:45:26] some great car like that but you're
[3:45:28] gonna have to put the work in to get
[3:45:30] that
[3:45:33] but these people are not interested in
[3:45:35] such a thing as that because the devil
[3:45:37] has promised them
[3:45:40] you'll be all right you just take on a
[3:45:42] form of godliness now you may not say
[3:45:44] that directly to him but the message
[3:45:46] that is being communicated through the
[3:45:48] ministries that we see going around the
[3:45:50] ranks of this message telling the people
[3:45:52] oh just believe the prophet of god you
[3:45:54] don't need the holy ghost you don't need
[3:45:55] to be born again why mommy believes for
[3:45:57] you
[3:45:59] just push play and obey
[3:46:01] [Music]
[3:46:03] do you realize what a satanic spirit
[3:46:04] that is
[3:46:06] if pushing play and obeying was all that
[3:46:08] was ever required then every person that
[3:46:11] ever reformed would be in the rapture
[3:46:14] remember as a preacher of the gospel i
[3:46:16] am not a reformer
[3:46:17] thank you i am here to bring
[3:46:20] conversion amen
[3:46:23] praise the lord somebody yeah
[3:46:25] i am here to bring conversion to saints
[3:46:27] of god sons of god daughters of god
[3:46:30] according to the prophet if i've got the
[3:46:32] holy ghost i can impart eternal life to
[3:46:35] you
[3:46:37] amen how by the preaching of the gospel
[3:46:43] it's a whole lot easier to conform to
[3:46:45] something
[3:46:47] so they learn to catch phrases they
[3:46:49] learn the one-liners
[3:46:51] you girls are quit cutting your hair and
[3:46:52] you're wearing appropriate clothing and
[3:46:54] you boys you won't wear shorts and you
[3:46:55] won't be running around big gold chains
[3:46:57] around your neck and this side and the
[3:46:59] other like that you know i look like a
[3:47:00] son of god you'll dress like a son of
[3:47:03] you come and sit down in church
[3:47:05] everything will be all right you may
[3:47:06] even learn how to worship like the rest
[3:47:07] of us
[3:47:10] and the devil will tell you you're all
[3:47:11] right
[3:47:14] you got the token really what does that
[3:47:16] mean the token means the literal life of
[3:47:19] jesus christ
[3:47:20] you cannot have that without the baptism
[3:47:22] of the holy ghost
[3:47:24] oh but my mommy is believing for me
[3:47:27] my daddy is believing for me
[3:47:30] you know i had an individual tell me one
[3:47:31] time well if i can't make it as bright
[3:47:33] i'll take my chances as foolish virgin
[3:47:35] i said you're not even fit to be called
[3:47:37] a foolish virgin that's right because
[3:47:39] even they seek day and night for the
[3:47:40] baptism of the holy ghost
[3:47:42] praise the lord
[3:47:46] does such a mentality come from
[3:47:48] this is the reason satan fell from
[3:47:50] heaven
[3:47:54] so that he could gather subjects
[3:47:56] to plant his seed in
[3:47:59] watch us in second timothy chapter 3
[3:48:01] verse 13.
[3:48:03] now notice again he talks about how
[3:48:06] that these are the sort which creep into
[3:48:08] houses and led captives silly women
[3:48:10] that's not just women in general that's
[3:48:11] not speaking of just women that's
[3:48:13] churches
[3:48:14] captive silly churches churches that
[3:48:16] aren't established in the truth laden
[3:48:17] with sins led away with divers lust
[3:48:20] watches ever learning and never able to
[3:48:23] come to the knowledge of the truth
[3:48:25] look that word knowledge up sometimes
[3:48:26] and you'll find out that is an intimate
[3:48:29] relationship
[3:48:33] so do they learn the message sure they
[3:48:34] do every time they come to church they
[3:48:37] learn a new quote they learn a new fact
[3:48:38] they learn a new figure they learn a
[3:48:40] little different way to say it than what
[3:48:42] they did the day before
[3:48:44] but if what you are learning does not
[3:48:46] affect your life directly
[3:48:49] you are this category of people you are
[3:48:51] ever learning but never able to come to
[3:48:53] the true knowledge
[3:48:55] of the truth
[3:49:00] now as janice and chambers wish to moses
[3:49:02] wonder where paul got them words from
[3:49:06] there are website builders in that day
[3:49:08] they'd be tearing him all to pieces for
[3:49:09] that that's right
[3:49:10] we'll read it in just a moment the bible
[3:49:12] never even told us what their names were
[3:49:14] i wonder where paul got it from
[3:49:17] same one that told him though iron angel
[3:49:19] preached the gospel any different what
[3:49:20] you've heard it let him be a curse amen
[3:49:23] so do these also resist the truth
[3:49:26] yes
[3:49:27] but that don't mean that they're not in
[3:49:28] church
[3:49:30] so we get this idea in our mind that to
[3:49:32] be resistant to the truth means they
[3:49:34] don't go to church you're wrong
[3:49:37] the third pull remember one phase one
[3:49:40] attribute of the third pull will be a
[3:49:42] preaching to those that can never be
[3:49:43] saved where do y'all think that's going
[3:49:44] to take place at
[3:49:46] let us preachers are going to start
[3:49:47] going down through the back alleys of
[3:49:49] skid row and finding former church
[3:49:51] members and trying to get them saved
[3:49:53] don't you understand that anointing is
[3:49:55] upon people sitting right in the pew
[3:49:57] right next to you that instead of moving
[3:49:59] on to the full baptism of the holy ghost
[3:50:02] they'll sit right there and resist
[3:50:04] everything a true man of god tells us
[3:50:10] and the attitude is sometimes of some
[3:50:13] vote well i was in this message says
[3:50:14] before you were born you little smart
[3:50:16] alec well so was the devil in it before
[3:50:18] you was born smart alex so where does
[3:50:20] that put you
[3:50:24] words amen in case y'all forgot him
[3:50:26] [Music]
[3:50:30] there's no such thing as
[3:50:32] seniority somebody walking around glory
[3:50:35] to god i've got a piece of brother
[3:50:36] bradham suitcase i got a piece of his
[3:50:38] other sleeping bag i got a piece of his
[3:50:40] god does that matter to anybody
[3:50:44] i got a piece of the god that brother
[3:50:46] madam had
[3:50:51] i walked with him i fished with him i
[3:50:52] hunted with him so did judas walk with
[3:50:54] jesus sleep with jesus preach with jesus
[3:51:00] that's
[3:51:05] verse 13 but evil men and seducers will
[3:51:08] get better and better as we go
[3:51:09] [Music]
[3:51:10] no
[3:51:12] no
[3:51:14] you may not just get worse and worse oh
[3:51:16] yeah
[3:51:18] why
[3:51:20] because it's based on supply and demand
[3:51:23] if there was no demand for some of these
[3:51:26] mossback type preachers
[3:51:28] that just make everybody feel good
[3:51:29] rather than preach where you live
[3:51:31] there would be no supply there was no
[3:51:33] demand there would be no supply of such
[3:51:35] men around the ranks of this message
[3:51:40] well you all just ain't going to get
[3:51:41] into it are
[3:51:42] you brother ben this makes me nervous it
[3:51:46] should wake you up wide awake
[3:51:50] because this is one of the main problems
[3:51:52] we're facing
[3:51:54] bride war
[3:51:56] there's another bride sitting amongst
[3:51:58] the people of this message and she is
[3:51:59] impregnated with seat of discrepancy
[3:52:03] make no mistake she intends to put your
[3:52:05] lights out
[3:52:08] look at the way the attitude is already
[3:52:10] developing no more altar calls you know
[3:52:12] i was in a message church some time ago
[3:52:13] and a brother told me we're beyond all
[3:52:15] that i said there's proof right there
[3:52:17] you need to be the first one at the
[3:52:18] altar
[3:52:21] why would we forbid water if water's
[3:52:23] there to be baptized that's right amen
[3:52:28] look at where the nature of the message
[3:52:29] where the nature of message people look
[3:52:31] where the nature of them are going
[3:52:33] they're getting more formal
[3:52:35] and more quiet and more cold as we go on
[3:52:38] they're not interested in real godly
[3:52:40] worship they're not interested and
[3:52:42] staying all night in prayer meetings and
[3:52:43] whatever more they're not interested in
[3:52:45] discussing the word of the lord and
[3:52:48] true scriptural intercourse of the word
[3:52:54] they're busy talking about fishing and
[3:52:55] hunting and some other things exactly
[3:52:57] the truth
[3:52:59] and poor little sheep of god sitting
[3:53:01] there starving to death for a move of
[3:53:03] god
[3:53:05] and then some slicker in the pulpit say
[3:53:06] we're beyond all that
[3:53:09] we're in the word now well i hear
[3:53:11] brother branham say that when the word
[3:53:13] the revelation of the word comes there
[3:53:16] is a stimulation
[3:53:18] of revelation
[3:53:20] [Music]
[3:53:23] it ought to do something to stir our
[3:53:25] hearts if the revelation has really
[3:53:28] struck our heart let me ask you a
[3:53:29] question on the day of pentecost when
[3:53:31] the holy ghost come down did they come
[3:53:33] walking and file in order one behind
[3:53:35] another
[3:53:38] the bible said their guts are staggering
[3:53:40] deep on the holy ghost they got dropped
[3:53:43] hallelujah to god amen
[3:53:46] let me tell you brother god wants a
[3:53:48] drunk church
[3:53:50] he wants a church so drunk on the holy
[3:53:53] ghost they don't know what their name is
[3:53:57] [Applause]
[3:53:59] not on natural wine of the word but they
[3:54:01] want it on a spiritual revelation
[3:54:05] stimulating power that brings them into
[3:54:07] that place
[3:54:09] how the devil hates that
[3:54:14] he wants to be god he wants to be
[3:54:16] worshiped
[3:54:17] he wants a bunch of people to worship
[3:54:18] him
[3:54:22] the only way that true worship can take
[3:54:24] place in such a way is in a formal
[3:54:26] manner
[3:54:27] now now listen i heard you all clapped
[3:54:28] during the service now i'm not knocking
[3:54:30] you off for a clapping but you watch
[3:54:31] some of our message churches that's all
[3:54:33] they know how to do now
[3:54:36] they hear something good they clap
[3:54:38] in unison just like you would at a ball
[3:54:40] game or like you would in a movie or a
[3:54:42] player an opera coming to an end
[3:54:45] no more do people jump up on their feet
[3:54:46] and holler glory to god
[3:54:49] no more do they lay on their face crying
[3:54:51] out for god in a deeper experience
[3:54:54] now we've got to this push button thing
[3:54:56] we hear something good we go
[3:55:01] nothing against that if you feel led to
[3:55:03] clap and i know you do
[3:55:05] but how carried away have we gotten into
[3:55:07] this formality of worship that's right
[3:55:11] glory
[3:55:12] until we get to a place to where we have
[3:55:14] to do it a certain way
[3:55:16] and behave a certain way because of
[3:55:18] course it's being streamed on the
[3:55:19] internet
[3:55:22] have you ever saw a facebook and
[3:55:24] instagram or twitter pic of somebody
[3:55:27] laying drunk with slobber out of their
[3:55:28] mouth and said what this is what
[3:55:30] happened to me at church tonight
[3:55:34] it don't look too good on facebook
[3:55:38] praise the lord nobody wants pictures
[3:55:40] taken like that now you'll take a
[3:55:42] picture of your apple pie but you won't
[3:55:43] take it when you was slain drunk on the
[3:55:45] holy ghost lamb with your mouth hanging
[3:55:47] open
[3:55:48] amen
[3:55:49] preach brother
[3:55:51] hallelujah amen
[3:55:54] we've become such a people of culture
[3:55:57] until every note has to be played
[3:55:59] exactly
[3:56:00] every note has to be sung exactly
[3:56:04] until we've lost that anointing of the
[3:56:06] spirit
[3:56:07] where brother benham told us that what
[3:56:09] god wants in his church listen to me is
[3:56:12] spontaneous christianity
[3:56:15] glory
[3:56:18] not a bunch of push button
[3:56:20] programmed
[3:56:22] copycatted religion
[3:56:24] [Music]
[3:56:25] preaching
[3:56:27] glory to god
[3:56:29] amen
[3:56:31] i know this is tough stuff look it's not
[3:56:32] easy for me to say these things
[3:56:34] but this is the hour we're living in
[3:56:36] as evangelist i'm supposed to reprove
[3:56:38] and rebuke with our long suffering and
[3:56:40] doctrine
[3:56:41] i am doing what god called me to do this
[3:56:43] morning if it upsets you i am sorry but
[3:56:45] i am obeying my call
[3:56:50] praise the lord
[3:56:54] do i have permission at this church to
[3:56:56] preach like an evangelist
[3:57:04] notice the rising of the sun
[3:57:06] there has been churches churches and
[3:57:08] brides brides
[3:57:13] so there have been more groups than just
[3:57:14] what we say bride what does that mean
[3:57:18] bride means she's a spouse
[3:57:21] and if she is espoused of jesus christ
[3:57:23] that means she has never went to the
[3:57:25] full place of that secret chamber with
[3:57:27] him
[3:57:29] because remember revelation chapter 19
[3:57:31] when the bible said that the wife the
[3:57:33] wife not the bride the wife half made
[3:57:36] herself ready
[3:57:37] notice she couldn't make herself bride
[3:57:39] but she could make herself ready
[3:57:43] hallelujah because i never chose myself
[3:57:46] you didn't choose you amen it was god's
[3:57:49] own choosing to make me him
[3:57:50] [Music]
[3:57:51] [Applause]
[3:57:55] praise god
[3:57:58] he said but there must come a real bride
[3:58:01] imagine this 1965 april of 65 easter
[3:58:05] weekend of 65. here we are in easter
[3:58:07] weekend of 2021.
[3:58:09] yeah and all them years ago brother
[3:58:11] bannon was looking for a real bride
[3:58:14] somewhere
[3:58:17] that was his call you know
[3:58:18] get a bride for isaac
[3:58:21] there must come one that's not only got
[3:58:23] the mechanics
[3:58:29] but the dynamics of it
[3:58:32] that makes the church live
[3:58:35] and move in the power of his
[3:58:37] resurrection
[3:58:40] amen praise be to god because you
[3:58:44] realize god is always moving
[3:58:47] in the beginning the holy spirit moved
[3:58:48] on the face of the waters god moved on
[3:58:51] the prophets as it was spoken the whole
[3:58:53] day god is always in motion
[3:58:57] when those four living creatures were
[3:58:59] identified and visioned by ezekiel their
[3:59:01] wheels were always moving by never
[3:59:03] moving backwards
[3:59:04] [Applause]
[3:59:05] [Music]
[3:59:06] the bride must always be in motion
[3:59:10] glory always moving
[3:59:13] always pressing ahead
[3:59:15] [Applause]
[3:59:21] do you know the only thing that stops
[3:59:24] is a denominational spirit
[3:59:26] that's what it means
[3:59:30] they make a nation unto themselves a
[3:59:32] denomination
[3:59:35] they form their own laws they form their
[3:59:37] own rules they form their own
[3:59:44] but evil men and seducers this word
[3:59:46] seducer means to be
[3:59:49] a juggler
[3:59:52] sure you know how to juggle don't you
[3:59:55] well if you don't let me teach you okay
[3:59:58] in order to properly juggle you'll have
[4:00:00] three or four objects in your hand
[4:00:03] and
[4:00:04] you must take the said object and throw
[4:00:07] it in such a manner circular manner
[4:00:10] and you must thought in such a way that
[4:00:12] you only put so much emphasis on one of
[4:00:14] those objects before you move on to the
[4:00:16] next one
[4:00:17] right always going in a motion that
[4:00:20] never moves you anywhere except for back
[4:00:22] to the start all over again that's right
[4:00:25] all right
[4:00:28] glory to god
[4:00:30] there go
[4:00:31] welcome to juggling class today amen
[4:00:34] i'm going to teach you what to watch for
[4:00:36] when it comes to the impostors around
[4:00:38] this message
[4:00:39] they will be the ones that when they
[4:00:41] preach the gospel to you they will
[4:00:42] almost tell you to get born again and
[4:00:44] then move on to the next subject they
[4:00:46] will almost tell you what the message
[4:00:48] really means but keep moving on to the
[4:00:50] next subject they will almost tell you
[4:00:52] how to live right but keep on moving to
[4:00:53] the next subject because you see it
[4:00:55] affects their offering if they don't do
[4:00:56] the other
[4:00:58] right
[4:01:00] the popularity will be affected yes
[4:01:05] so they just keep moving on you've seen
[4:01:08] people like that in your lifetime not
[4:01:09] just preachers but there are individuals
[4:01:11] that when you try to really get them
[4:01:13] face to face with the real issue they'll
[4:01:15] just
[4:01:16] okay let's move on that's a juggler
[4:01:20] he's got to keep things in motion but
[4:01:21] never moves forward always it turns
[4:01:23] right back to the same old thing he was
[4:01:25] in the beginning that's right
[4:01:28] praise god that's right notice that the
[4:01:31] bride of jesus christ her shape was not
[4:01:34] a circle as much as it was a pyramid
[4:01:39] she just kept moving up
[4:01:40] [Music]
[4:01:43] oh i know eternity is a circle yes i get
[4:01:46] that but when we're talking about the
[4:01:48] deceivers of the hour they only lay
[4:01:51] enough emphasis on the truth to keep
[4:01:54] things in motion
[4:01:56] that's right
[4:02:00] let's turn to exodus chapter 7 verse 10
[4:02:02] now
[4:02:04] you got a little time
[4:02:05] hey i was teasing you about that three
[4:02:07] hour thing but hey i can hold to that if
[4:02:09] you want me to
[4:02:12] hey when i get in the honeypot like this
[4:02:14] i don't want to quit
[4:02:15] [Music]
[4:02:17] action chapter 7 verse 10.
[4:02:19] thank you jesus
[4:02:21] and moses and aaron went into pharaoh
[4:02:24] they did as the lord had commanded aaron
[4:02:26] cast down his rod before pharaoh before
[4:02:28] his servants and it became a serpent
[4:02:32] then pharaoh also called the wise men
[4:02:34] and the sorcerers
[4:02:36] now the magicians of egypt
[4:02:38] and they also did in like manner with
[4:02:40] their enchantments enchantments
[4:02:44] all right now you don't know this exists
[4:02:47] okay
[4:02:48] never heard this before in your life
[4:02:50] you don't know who moses is you don't
[4:02:51] know who aaron is
[4:02:52] you don't know nothing about none of
[4:02:54] this
[4:02:55] and you are in egypt right now you're
[4:02:57] not in minneapolis minnesota you're not
[4:02:59] in brooklyn heights you're not
[4:03:01] you're in egypt okay
[4:03:03] you and i are standing at the sideline
[4:03:06] pharaoh's on his throne
[4:03:08] up through the court walks moses and
[4:03:10] aaron with their sticks in their hand
[4:03:12] aaron walks up and says
[4:03:14] let my people go thus saith the lord
[4:03:17] pharaoh starts into his whole spiel
[4:03:19] about well you know who is the lord and
[4:03:21] who is man and such a man i should obey
[4:03:23] him and on and on
[4:03:25] and aaron takes his rod and moses throw
[4:03:27] it down and say thus saith the lord
[4:03:31] i know you're on the sideline watching
[4:03:33] all of a sudden here comes the magicians
[4:03:35] of egypt janice and james paul
[4:03:37] identifies them and they throw their
[4:03:38] snake on the ground too
[4:03:41] which one you going to believe
[4:03:45] which side do you take
[4:03:48] now you don't know any of this exists
[4:03:49] you've never heard this before in your
[4:03:50] life okay
[4:03:52] you don't know who moses is except you
[4:03:54] might have been in egypt when he killed
[4:03:55] that dead that egyptian out there that
[4:03:56] dead egyptian
[4:03:59] you know just a little bit about aaron
[4:04:00] perhaps
[4:04:02] but you don't know what they're doing
[4:04:03] here
[4:04:04] you haven't seen moses in 40 years
[4:04:06] maybe some old timers standing on the
[4:04:08] sideline going wow look how old he's
[4:04:10] gotten lost all his hair
[4:04:16] now they throw their rod down and they
[4:04:17] say thus saith the lord here comes the
[4:04:19] egyptians doing the same thing
[4:04:22] from the outside looking in
[4:04:24] which side do you take come on brother
[4:04:29] hallelujah all right let's change the
[4:04:31] scene let's transport back to the 21st
[4:04:33] century you're in church
[4:04:36] somebody says and the prophet of god
[4:04:38] said and everybody goes glory to god
[4:04:45] well which one's the real bride
[4:04:48] which one looks like the real true bride
[4:04:52] remember in the vision the prophet said
[4:04:54] the wheat jumped up praise god praise
[4:04:57] all right and the terror done the same
[4:04:59] thing
[4:05:04] there was no difference
[4:05:06] in the external behavior of either one
[4:05:09] of them
[4:05:14] but let's read the next verse
[4:05:19] for they cast down every man his rod
[4:05:23] and they became serpents
[4:05:27] but
[4:05:28] i love that little three-letter word
[4:05:32] any good thing you'll read in the
[4:05:34] scripture that's the word that leads
[4:05:35] into it
[4:05:37] for example if you was to take it in the
[4:05:39] idea of malachi 4 and 5 that god would
[4:05:41] have smote this earth with a curse and
[4:05:43] wiped every one of us out and we all
[4:05:44] would have wound up in hell deserving of
[4:05:46] hell were captured in the regions of the
[4:05:48] lost but god sent elijah
[4:05:51] [Music]
[4:05:53] amen the world had no idea of the
[4:05:55] mystery of god john was crying amen
[4:05:58] nobody worthy to take the book but in
[4:06:01] the days of the voice of the savior
[4:06:06] oh yes in the book of ephesians whenever
[4:06:08] he said some of you were sinners and and
[4:06:10] liars and whoremongers and truckers
[4:06:14] god who is rich in mercy
[4:06:18] [Applause]
[4:06:19] hallelujah
[4:06:21] [Music]
[4:06:26] but aaron's rod
[4:06:29] swallowed up their rods
[4:06:35] so the revelation of who was right
[4:06:39] and who was true blue not so much the
[4:06:41] right part you understand but more of
[4:06:44] the idea of the one that god had
[4:06:47] justified
[4:06:48] god had sanctioned god had correctly
[4:06:51] ordained
[4:06:54] it's not a matter of being right
[4:06:56] but it's about god putting his rightness
[4:06:58] in you
[4:07:00] do you understand me
[4:07:02] amen so the revelation of who was right
[4:07:06] did not come at the beginning
[4:07:08] it didn't come at the middle
[4:07:15] hallelujah
[4:07:18] it came at the very end
[4:07:23] no wonder
[4:07:25] when the prophet of god saw the preview
[4:07:27] of the bride
[4:07:29] why i've always wondered why would god
[4:07:30] let them two at the end start
[4:07:33] you know kindly looking around and
[4:07:35] scooting around and kind of and that
[4:07:37] voice hollered get back in line
[4:07:39] did you notice when you hollered get
[4:07:41] back in line those two young people at
[4:07:43] the end of the line didn't rebuke him
[4:07:45] and they didn't get angry at him and
[4:07:46] they didn't try to correct him they just
[4:07:47] got right back in step like he told them
[4:07:49] to do
[4:07:52] it goes to prove to us at the very end
[4:07:55] we'll all be influenced by things
[4:07:57] that'll cause us to look around and
[4:07:58] stray maybe a little bit
[4:08:00] but when that voice comes
[4:08:02] [Music]
[4:08:03] [Applause]
[4:08:14] [Music]
[4:08:15] they'll hear that voice speak
[4:08:18] and they'll just fall right back in line
[4:08:19] oh my god
[4:08:20] i didn't realize i was doing that lord
[4:08:22] i'm sorry
[4:08:24] watch us now
[4:08:26] in the message adoption the prophet said
[4:08:27] as genesis and jammers withstood moses
[4:08:29] said well
[4:08:30] they did pretty near the same thing that
[4:08:32] moses did until it come into a showdown
[4:08:35] remember janice and chambridge could
[4:08:36] bring the plagues but they couldn't take
[4:08:39] him away all right
[4:08:44] god is a healer
[4:08:47] and god's word remains the truth yes
[4:08:49] amen
[4:08:50] they could bring the curse
[4:08:52] but they couldn't remove it
[4:08:57] i guarantee you brother
[4:08:59] people that have walked off and left
[4:09:00] this truth i don't try to throw them
[4:09:01] under the bus i don't try to throw them
[4:09:03] in hell
[4:09:04] i say god bless and make whatever
[4:09:05] decision they need to make
[4:09:07] but there's a reason that people all the
[4:09:08] way up here in this time period begin
[4:09:10] walking away from this message
[4:09:13] it's time
[4:09:15] it's time to defend the crowd
[4:09:18] the preaching of the words circumstances
[4:09:20] things that lay before us it's going to
[4:09:22] thin the crowd out even more and let me
[4:09:23] tell you something before you become a
[4:09:25] statistic decide whether you want to
[4:09:27] give your heart to this or not
[4:09:31] because the further we get down here to
[4:09:32] the end
[4:09:34] it won't just be the devil trying to
[4:09:35] discourage you out of this
[4:09:37] it'll be god trying to force you out
[4:09:41] because the word will get so tough
[4:09:43] it'll get so razor's edge and so
[4:09:45] straight
[4:09:47] that if the righteous scarcely be saved
[4:09:48] what about the rest of them that's right
[4:09:53] again israel in the church he said
[4:09:54] joseph was sold for almost 30 pieces of
[4:09:56] silver by his brothers
[4:09:58] the jewish church betrayed joseph
[4:10:01] today what is it in this church a
[4:10:03] betrayal
[4:10:05] they're getting documents he said well
[4:10:06] now they've got this keep this in your
[4:10:07] mind they're going to have a
[4:10:08] confederation of churches that's right
[4:10:11] he said the churches of america have
[4:10:12] already begun confederating all their
[4:10:13] churches together they're going to have
[4:10:15] a ban with the protestants and the
[4:10:16] catholics together that'll hook up with
[4:10:18] catholicism to try to unite together and
[4:10:21] all those enter denominations that's you
[4:10:24] if you didn't know
[4:10:25] who stand for the truth
[4:10:27] and get away from that dogma they will
[4:10:29] be persecuted
[4:10:34] they'll come together he said to put out
[4:10:37] communism
[4:10:41] and all of those
[4:10:45] that stand against this move
[4:10:49] will be
[4:10:50] boycotted all right listen to me
[4:10:52] carefully
[4:10:54] to boycott someone
[4:10:56] doesn't necessarily mean you have to be
[4:10:58] outside with picket signs
[4:11:01] and the cameras looking at you from
[4:11:02] msnbc or fox news saying down with this
[4:11:04] church a bunch of branhamites a bunch of
[4:11:06] devils a bunch of holy rollers a bunch
[4:11:07] of whatever
[4:11:09] a wife can boycott her husband by not
[4:11:11] showing affection
[4:11:12] a husband can boycott his wife by not
[4:11:14] showing affection back to her not
[4:11:16] providing for her needs
[4:11:18] a child can boycott its parent by
[4:11:20] disobedient
[4:11:22] disobedient and not paying attention and
[4:11:23] not learning and not you know being over
[4:11:25] uh just just following the rules
[4:11:28] you can boycott in many ways
[4:11:30] for example
[4:11:32] you can sit right here in this church
[4:11:34] and if you don't like what me or the
[4:11:36] juan or some other preacher is preaching
[4:11:38] you can sit right there and fold up your
[4:11:40] spirit as same as your arms
[4:11:42] and decide you're not gonna listen i'm
[4:11:44] not picking on you for folding arms now
[4:11:45] but i'm talking about your your spirit
[4:11:47] in that way
[4:11:49] amen you can close yourself down that
[4:11:51] the man of god has no place in you
[4:11:55] that's boycotting
[4:11:59] when you come to church and you're
[4:12:00] closed up and nobody can move you
[4:12:03] nobody
[4:12:04] no matter how hot they're playing the
[4:12:05] song it could be red hot three-quarters
[4:12:07] and a cloud of dust and you are sitting
[4:12:08] there shut up
[4:12:11] shut down shut up and closed off
[4:12:14] don't you laugh what you're doing you're
[4:12:15] boycotting
[4:12:18] the truth praise the lord
[4:12:21] the prophet of god said in the last day
[4:12:23] the mark of the beast the persecution
[4:12:24] will be a boycott
[4:12:27] against the bride
[4:12:31] again he said do you realize in the last
[4:12:33] day it'll be a duel of spirits
[4:12:35] he said i wasn't going to say this the
[4:12:36] holy spirit's pressing now he said he
[4:12:38] realized the bible teaches the last day
[4:12:39] the two spirits will come to a showdown
[4:12:42] that's not through some doctrine of
[4:12:43] churches or something
[4:12:45] there's some of these folks that run
[4:12:46] around thinking that the last battle of
[4:12:47] the last day is going to be a battle of
[4:12:49] who's got the right doctrine they're all
[4:12:51] mixed up
[4:12:53] because it'll be a whole lot closer and
[4:12:55] a whole lot further down the road than
[4:12:56] that it'll be so close it would deceive
[4:12:59] the elected if it was possible
[4:13:02] praise the lord
[4:13:05] oh my he said again
[4:13:07] that's right
[4:13:08] it'll come to a show that it'll come to
[4:13:10] the place that the little church has
[4:13:11] believed the message
[4:13:13] stood on both feet with her eyes
[4:13:15] centered to the cross
[4:13:17] he said it will come to a showdown
[4:13:19] praise the lord it said no wonder he
[4:13:21] said when he's counsel of churches he
[4:13:23] said it's so honeycomb with communistic
[4:13:30] no wonder they can't believe in the
[4:13:31] supernatural
[4:13:34] no wonder they can't believe in divine
[4:13:35] healing they don't have any message in
[4:13:38] their heart
[4:13:41] no matter how hard they're running now
[4:13:42] do you know what this word communism
[4:13:44] means
[4:13:45] communism is a social system that is
[4:13:48] either governed by a band of leaders or
[4:13:50] by one dictator
[4:13:52] so you realize the prophet saying that
[4:13:54] the churches were honeycombed with
[4:13:55] communistic well of course they were
[4:13:58] when brother badam didn't preach it the
[4:13:59] way they wanted him to preach it what
[4:14:01] did they do stop attending his meetings
[4:14:04] spread it out to everybody else don't go
[4:14:06] to that brother branham's meeting the
[4:14:07] women would show up with bobbin pins all
[4:14:09] up in their hair so because the brother
[4:14:10] venom saw you with short hair they
[4:14:12] thought he'd preach on them
[4:14:16] they tell me one pastor down in indiana
[4:14:18] who was sitting there in los angeles and
[4:14:19] choosing another bride
[4:14:20] the higher brother bannon preached
[4:14:22] against him organized religion the more
[4:14:24] than people were walking out and the and
[4:14:26] the brothers said that while they were
[4:14:27] at the altar screaming and brother brown
[4:14:28] was prophesying about los angeles they
[4:14:30] were walking out by the hundreds out of
[4:14:32] the auditorium
[4:14:34] that's a boycott
[4:14:36] what do you think they do today to us
[4:14:38] modern day ministers
[4:14:40] when you bring a spirit of the lord on a
[4:14:42] anointed evangelist or a pastor a
[4:14:44] teacher apostle or a prophet and they
[4:14:46] come and they bring the word of the lord
[4:14:47] and the people sit there and thumb
[4:14:48] through a song book or thumb through
[4:14:49] their phone or look at their watch or
[4:14:51] they study some other thing thinking
[4:14:53] what in the world am i hearing this
[4:14:54] stuff again for
[4:14:57] it's communistic
[4:15:00] even greater than that when you have a
[4:15:01] social system around the ranks that if
[4:15:04] you're not a part of the popular club
[4:15:06] and the boys club then you're not
[4:15:08] recognized as one of the ordained
[4:15:09] ministers
[4:15:11] i got news for these big guys around the
[4:15:12] message that think they're such a hot
[4:15:14] shot and i don't mean big churches i
[4:15:15] mean these big guys that think they run
[4:15:17] things
[4:15:18] and these guys that think that they
[4:15:19] control the message god will go down
[4:15:21] into a a ghetto he'll go down into a uh
[4:15:25] amen into the buckets of the world and
[4:15:27] he'll raise him up some son of god that
[4:15:29] anger associated with none of this mess
[4:15:33] an anointing to preach the gospel and
[4:15:34] tell the truth
[4:15:36] amen amen
[4:15:39] but when you see the people around this
[4:15:40] message beginning to associate and club
[4:15:42] themselves together
[4:15:44] i know people got things in common so
[4:15:46] they associate together when they've
[4:15:47] gotten things in common but the prophet
[4:15:49] of god said if i've got the holy ghost
[4:15:51] and you've got the holy ghost it should
[4:15:52] make a tuxedo wrap its arm around a pair
[4:15:54] of overhauls and love him anyhow
[4:15:58] even though we realize we're not all the
[4:16:00] same we are a people of inclusion
[4:16:03] we allow the holy spirit to welcome
[4:16:05] anybody in that wants to serve god and
[4:16:07] later on
[4:16:09] even brethren talked about the behavior
[4:16:10] in the churches he said as long as
[4:16:12] people come to church and behave
[4:16:14] themselves they're welcome to come
[4:16:18] right
[4:16:20] so the great showdown of the last day
[4:16:22] watch again
[4:16:23] question answer brother brown speaking
[4:16:24] of the mark of the beast don't you
[4:16:25] believe that'll be a tattoo in a head or
[4:16:27] a number or a hand or something
[4:16:30] no sir don't you never look for that
[4:16:34] during quarantine i was absolutely
[4:16:36] slapping my forehead day after day at
[4:16:39] the people in this message posting on
[4:16:41] there that the mark of the beast was an
[4:16:42] rfid chip or some kind of a little
[4:16:45] tattoo or they put the mark of the beast
[4:16:47] in your pfizer shot or your modernist
[4:16:49] shot or are you going to get the mark of
[4:16:50] the beast injected into you or it's
[4:16:52] going to come by some scan on your
[4:16:54] driver's license don't you know the
[4:16:56] message any better than that
[4:16:58] that's what i wanted to say to him
[4:16:59] that's right
[4:17:02] that's not the mark of the beast
[4:17:04] the mark of the beast is simply this
[4:17:06] it's a rejection of the holy ghost
[4:17:12] and if the holy ghost is on you with the
[4:17:14] holy ghost is on me and i'm preaching
[4:17:16] the truth if you're living the truth and
[4:17:19] then somebody rejects that
[4:17:21] [Applause]
[4:17:31] don't you never look for that it will be
[4:17:34] a boycott
[4:17:40] as it was said from some great renowned
[4:17:43] deal here some years ago
[4:17:45] that when it come to the real ministry
[4:17:47] of the last day
[4:17:49] true ministers of the gospel will see
[4:17:51] the necessity
[4:17:52] of playing brother branham's tapes
[4:17:56] let me tell you something brother god
[4:17:57] never called me to bring a mechanical
[4:17:59] device up here and try to get you into
[4:18:01] the holy ghost
[4:18:03] god called me to preach the gospel
[4:18:07] a tape player can't point its finger in
[4:18:09] your face
[4:18:11] a tape player can't get down where
[4:18:13] you're living at right here today
[4:18:16] i don't say that god couldn't use his
[4:18:17] word to parallel events in your life and
[4:18:20] parallel experiences that you've had but
[4:18:23] god never called mechanical devices to
[4:18:25] get the bride ready for the rapture
[4:18:30] i might use a tablet i might use a cell
[4:18:32] phone i might use all kinds of devices
[4:18:34] that is just an aid for me when i need
[4:18:36] to preach i rely upon my my new birth
[4:18:40] i rely upon the
[4:18:46] preacher oh hell praise the lord you
[4:18:49] know we we we love the prophet yes we
[4:18:52] love the message and any true man of god
[4:18:54] that's preaching truth he's going to
[4:18:55] preach a message
[4:18:57] sure you'll say just like brother
[4:18:58] brethren said it
[4:18:59] not draw people after himself say well
[4:19:01] you better do it like i do it no we do
[4:19:03] it like what brother brown taught us to
[4:19:04] do it
[4:19:05] right and like the bible taught us
[4:19:07] but notice the world today is gripped by
[4:19:09] two forces i'm getting really close
[4:19:11] don't get nervous
[4:19:13] two great forces coming to a showdown
[4:19:17] just like it was esau and jacob
[4:19:21] they represent both these forces came
[4:19:22] down both had the same father
[4:19:25] and the same mother
[4:19:28] glory to god amen
[4:19:31] in the same womb fussing and fighting
[4:19:33] and they've been at war with each other
[4:19:34] ever since right
[4:19:38] and spoken words you'll see brother said
[4:19:40] in the latter rain
[4:19:42] there will come a showdown
[4:19:44] between jesus
[4:19:47] and denominations and creeds
[4:19:51] and when he comes a showdown the rapture
[4:19:54] of the bride amen
[4:19:59] so do you want to know the ones that's
[4:20:01] really going to be spoken for
[4:20:03] it'll be the ones that they wake up that
[4:20:05] morning and they're having a bad day
[4:20:07] kind of like this morning i was i was i
[4:20:09] was online i was taking care of a few
[4:20:11] things online
[4:20:12] and and i was under a time situation and
[4:20:15] so as i was trying to get through uh
[4:20:17] some of the classes that i was teaching
[4:20:19] i had a drink knocked the drink over
[4:20:21] went all over my phone when all of my
[4:20:23] papers went everything and i'm trying to
[4:20:25] do this while i look into the camera and
[4:20:26] smiling continuing to teach
[4:20:30] on and on and on this morning
[4:20:35] and the devil will wake up and start
[4:20:36] talking to you
[4:20:37] you're not saved you ain't got the holy
[4:20:39] ghost you know i've always asked him
[4:20:41] how do you know what the holy ghost
[4:20:43] looks like
[4:20:47] the next time the devil tells you you're
[4:20:48] not saved ask him this how do you know
[4:20:50] what save looks like you're not saved
[4:20:55] you know what he says to me you ain't
[4:20:57] nothing but serpent seed i always tell
[4:20:58] him takes one to know what
[4:21:02] come on
[4:21:06] amen
[4:21:09] but the showdown will be between jesus
[4:21:13] and denominations because the real bride
[4:21:17] will produce
[4:21:19] jesus
[4:21:23] his love
[4:21:24] his nature
[4:21:26] his character his revelation
[4:21:30] his attributes
[4:21:34] amen will not be a bunch of people that
[4:21:37] just pack a bunch of quotes in their
[4:21:39] hand
[4:21:41] saying brother branham said brother
[4:21:42] branham said brother brahman said don't
[4:21:43] you get tired of that
[4:21:45] let me tell i love to hear this message
[4:21:47] i get tired of a bunch of guys and all
[4:21:49] they know how to do is say brother ram
[4:21:50] said and they don't know how to take me
[4:21:51] nowhere
[4:21:53] if you're going to quote this message to
[4:21:54] me take me somewhere
[4:21:56] don't just read quotes for quote's sake
[4:21:58] take me somewhere that's right
[4:22:01] don't just read the bible to me because
[4:22:02] it's something we do take me somewhere
[4:22:05] [Music]
[4:22:10] some easter sermon huh
[4:22:14] but i'm trying to show you where we're
[4:22:16] at
[4:22:16] because remember this last day bride in
[4:22:19] resurrection in easter if you want to
[4:22:21] tie it together like that sure be fine
[4:22:24] when she comes to the place where she
[4:22:26] recognizes that god has vested his
[4:22:29] entire voice and authority in her
[4:22:30] remember what he said
[4:22:32] that she these sons of god will step out
[4:22:34] and take every power of the devil's got
[4:22:36] back from him
[4:22:37] right amen
[4:22:38] that's what he said whenever we come to
[4:22:40] rapture time
[4:22:41] and we talk about the third pool can i
[4:22:43] hit one thing before we go
[4:22:45] everybody okay
[4:22:50] you know in mark 11 he talked about a
[4:22:52] mountain speak to a mountain right
[4:22:55] now for some of us have been in this
[4:22:56] thing for a while i want to talk to you
[4:22:58] a minute about something
[4:23:00] the prophet of god said that
[4:23:03] he prayed that he would never come to a
[4:23:05] place of having a crabbit old spirit
[4:23:08] that's right remember he didn't want to
[4:23:09] be crowned with a complaining type
[4:23:11] spirit
[4:23:12] he makes a statement like this perfect
[4:23:14] strength my perfect weakness if you want
[4:23:15] to look it up 11 18 61
[4:23:17] the prophet of god said like this he
[4:23:19] said
[4:23:21] experiences
[4:23:23] accumulate
[4:23:27] sometimes you can't help
[4:23:29] for these things to affect you
[4:23:33] but for you and i that are in this
[4:23:34] message you know some of the greatest
[4:23:36] victories going to be for you and i
[4:23:39] to be able to live through every
[4:23:40] adulterous preacher through every
[4:23:42] backslidden church member through every
[4:23:43] persecution through everybody that this
[4:23:45] one left the message and that one done
[4:23:47] this and this one proved this and that
[4:23:48] one didn't prove that
[4:23:51] and then to continue coming into the
[4:23:53] doors
[4:23:54] and set down on the pew with all them
[4:23:56] experiences in front of you
[4:23:58] and speak to that mountain of
[4:24:00] experiences and say get behind me yes
[4:24:04] if you want to know what real third pull
[4:24:06] power looks like in your life
[4:24:08] it's being able to look at all of the
[4:24:09] deception and all of the lies and all of
[4:24:11] the cheating and all of the backbiting
[4:24:13] that you've had to endure as a christian
[4:24:15] and to be able to speak to that stuff
[4:24:17] and say get out of my way you are not
[4:24:19] going to influence
[4:24:22] [Applause]
[4:24:32] should i clap or should i not clap
[4:24:36] friend that wasn't the point what i'm
[4:24:37] trying to say it's the program worship
[4:24:39] i'm talking about
[4:24:41] we don't want to get into a program
[4:24:42] place where we have a certain routine
[4:24:44] god hates a routine like that
[4:24:47] don't get your stuff stuck in a routine
[4:24:48] that's right i tell people you come to
[4:24:50] church you're used to putting up your
[4:24:51] right arm put that left one up for a
[4:24:52] while
[4:24:53] if you drop this way jump the other way
[4:24:55] for a little while
[4:24:57] break it up yourself do something
[4:24:58] different
[4:24:59] if you're saying glory glory glory come
[4:25:01] to church say amen amen
[4:25:04] amen watch the nominations watch them on
[4:25:07] the television and watch some of these
[4:25:08] internet programs when john hagee hits
[4:25:10] his high point out there in that
[4:25:12] san antonio tabernacle watching people
[4:25:14] they know right when they clap
[4:25:16] nothing spontaneous about it it's
[4:25:18] programmed
[4:25:21] they follow the inspiration of it anyhow
[4:25:23] i've done made that point to you
[4:25:25] but all of these accumulation of
[4:25:27] experiences
[4:25:28] how many people have you been in this
[4:25:29] message and you crossed paths with that
[4:25:31] have hated you
[4:25:33] back bit you
[4:25:35] lied on you said things about you
[4:25:38] caused all kinds of manners of evil to
[4:25:40] come into your life and yet you're
[4:25:41] sitting here right now
[4:25:43] why because when a mountain is set
[4:25:45] before you
[4:25:47] you have the ability by that great
[4:25:49] spoken word faith to be able to look at
[4:25:50] that mountain and say i'm not going to
[4:25:52] let that experience stop me
[4:25:55] [Music]
[4:25:57] [Applause]
[4:26:01] i'll remind you of this one thing as a
[4:26:03] close
[4:26:04] when brother branham come down toward
[4:26:05] the end of his life look at some of the
[4:26:08] battles if you study that part of
[4:26:09] brother brown's life
[4:26:11] study those attributes
[4:26:14] and those
[4:26:15] little nuances in brother graham's life
[4:26:17] toward the end
[4:26:19] watch him
[4:26:20] you hear him talk about putting the
[4:26:21] cross up because he wanted to keep his
[4:26:22] eyes off women and you hear him talking
[4:26:24] about the battles with preachers out
[4:26:26] there and how they wanted to preach but
[4:26:27] he comes down to those last couple of
[4:26:29] years and listen at him
[4:26:31] i got in a complex because i thought
[4:26:32] people didn't want to hear me
[4:26:35] you know a lot of them things were
[4:26:36] produced by
[4:26:37] the 30 years of experience brother
[4:26:39] branham had of people defending him
[4:26:40] hurting him lying on him stepping on him
[4:26:42] and saying all manners of thing on him
[4:26:45] and when he got down here at the very
[4:26:46] end the real mountain that he had to
[4:26:48] face was that mountain of experiences
[4:26:50] that lay before him all the time
[4:26:53] hallelujah
[4:26:54] and he said he had to go through the
[4:26:55] parking lot he said look through the
[4:26:56] license plate see people driving from
[4:26:58] all over the country and said he'd put
[4:26:59] that back on the devil and say well what
[4:27:00] about that if they don't want to hear me
[4:27:02] what about all those
[4:27:06] look at the battles he faced at the end
[4:27:09] he thought people didn't want to hear
[4:27:10] what he had to say
[4:27:12] oh
[4:27:14] i would that god would let me know if
[4:27:16] this was right or not
[4:27:17] but i would love to know how brother
[4:27:19] branham may feel about it now
[4:27:21] if god ever look him pat let him look
[4:27:23] past the curtain of time i wonder would
[4:27:24] the lord ever let him just be able to
[4:27:26] look down maybe through some kind of a
[4:27:28] spiritual telescope and look now
[4:27:31] look at them all over africa and india
[4:27:32] new zealand and australia and around the
[4:27:34] different parts of the world all through
[4:27:36] central and south america all through
[4:27:38] north america all through russia and all
[4:27:40] those countries up there like that
[4:27:43] the very man that come to the very end
[4:27:45] of his days and got to thinking nobody
[4:27:47] wanted to hear what he had to say and
[4:27:49] those were the very messages
[4:27:52] that so positioned us
[4:27:54] that we call it the opening of the word
[4:27:58] again
[4:28:01] and yet that was the battle he faced at
[4:28:03] the end
[4:28:05] let me tell you something brother
[4:28:07] the reason satan fell from heaven
[4:28:10] is because he wanted to take control
[4:28:13] of everything
[4:28:14] that god had
[4:28:16] you are the greatest hindrance
[4:28:19] that satan will ever have because out of
[4:28:21] everything he can control in this world
[4:28:24] he cannot control you and i
[4:28:27] thank you
[4:28:29] [Applause]
[4:28:30] [Music]
[4:28:33] that's why i say thank you jesus he
[4:28:36] cannot control my hands
[4:28:38] they will worship the lord
[4:28:40] he cannot control my feet they will
[4:28:43] worship the lord he will not control my
[4:28:46] voice or my breath or my strength or my
[4:28:49] mind or my soul or my body
[4:28:53] they will serve the lord
[4:28:57] as for me and my house
[4:29:00] [Applause]
[4:29:00] [Music]
[4:29:02] not a house made with two by fours and
[4:29:04] nails
[4:29:05] but my house
[4:29:08] i will serve we will serve
[4:29:15] it's a bride
[4:29:16] war the last thing you and i will
[4:29:19] experience is a war between these two
[4:29:21] groups
[4:29:23] church formal
[4:29:24] church spiritual that's exactly the
[4:29:26] truth you ever had that feeling being in
[4:29:28] an assembly when you really worship the
[4:29:29] lord for some of you that like to
[4:29:30] worship and you really like to get out
[4:29:32] there and demonstrative and you like to
[4:29:34] worship the lord you ever go to an
