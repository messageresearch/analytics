[0:00] is loud at any time on Earth will
[0:02] certainly do a most racial thing if you
[0:04] don't spend that time in service of God
[0:06] I don't care what he does if you're
[0:08] going to be a heartbreak for the women
[0:10] or so forth you better take that young
[0:13] age that first 25 if you're going to be
[0:15] a carpenter a mechanic or something you
[0:17] better take the second 25 see but I was
[0:20] thinking about what about me what would
[0:22] I take I'd take from 75 to 100 I'd be
[0:26] smarter wiser i' be more settled I know
[0:30] more about what I'm doing I'm 10 eight
[0:32] or 10 years older than the last time I
[0:34] was overseas I won't jump in like I'm

[0:40] fighting the see you know about how
[0:42] to take a hold of you don't jump in
[0:44] there scratch you up see know his tricks
[0:47] and watch him what he does and we learn
[0:49] more about the enemy so we've got to
[0:51] find out all of his techniqus and how he
[0:53] approaches and what he does learn his
[0:56] punches then you're trained to go in on
[0:58] you see so I believe now I told her wife
[1:00] I believe I'm better shape now once when
[1:02] it's 40 years old and went over I'm 54
[1:05] now I believe if I live and can still
[1:07] get around as good as can now when I'm a
[1:09] 100 if I if Jesus would carry that long
[1:11] I'd be in better shape than I am now to

[1:16] know more about what to do and how to
[1:18] handle it how to handle the situation
[1:20] amen take a lot of people now if you're

[1:39] i' really go down here and get so and so
[1:41] I know he's had a lot of operations he
[1:43] knows how to do it that's that's you
[1:47] think about this but what about that
[1:48] soul I want somebody who knows where
[1:51] they're at knows the RO who's traveling
[1:55] yes indeed the Lord bless you all right
[1:57] brother get up here now God bless
[2:00] name don't forget now next time I was
[2:04] just uh had a surprise in my heart for
[2:08] the thing because in myself I had
[2:11] recognized I esteemed the ministry of my
[2:16] many Brethren outside of there before
[2:19] brother Brandon come I said I don't know
[2:20] is he a minister tonight I was talking
[2:23] to do Lee ve here and I said I was in
[2:27] the meeting at Middletown Ohio and you
[2:29] were the one that talked through the day
[2:32] and I said I deeply appreciated the
[2:34] meeting along with the teaching at
[2:36] brother veale did over there in
[2:39] conjunction with the meeting at
[2:40] Middletown yes and I said I esteemed the
[2:43] Servants of God and uh one of us I said
[2:47] whoever preaches it always does the
[2:49] other one good because the ministry is
[2:51] all inspired by the same spirit amen and
[2:55] uh there isn't any any selfishness or
[2:57] ambitiousness in me and I Delight to
[3:01] welcome the Ministers of God especially
[3:04] who are cooperating together with this
[3:07] and in it together with us I Delight to
[3:10] hear from them amen so I asked Dr Lee
[3:13] Vale I said would you minister at
[3:15] brother brandham does brother brandham
[3:18] didn't he might have known this but
[3:20] didn't say anything
[3:22] about so I asked uh brother Vale tonight
[3:26] if he would Minister for us in case of
[3:29] brother Brandon didn't because he
[3:30] associated with him in the meetings and
[3:33] he knows about the way this way and
[3:36] we're glad to have brother Veil I
[3:38] appreciate him and respect him as well
[3:40] as I do any of the other ministers and
[3:43] like I do all the others and so if he
[3:44] will come tonight and speak for us I'd
[3:47] be delighted to have him to do it God
[3:49] bless and let's pray for brother Veil
[3:52] some of you have never heard him and I
[3:54] trust that you'll pray for
[3:58] him
[4:00] I apologize to the audience I didn't
[4:02] know sit there I did this was fixed up
[4:04] God bless you brother day it wasn't
[4:05] fixed up he said if you didn't
[4:08] come good that's fine I'll get he myself
[4:11] brother B spoke him any time iead of in
[4:13] the meetings and and so forth he managed
[4:15] the meetings for a long time and fine
[4:17] Brother done a swell job and I'm sure
[4:19] this audience is always glad to hear
[4:21] Brother ve when he speak Lord bless
[4:28] brother
[4:30] so much was said uh I couldn't say
[4:33] nothing to make it any better and I
[4:36] truly believe that it was the Lord that
[4:39] worked this out for brother Veil to
[4:42] bring this man amen after this morning
[4:45] yeah so do you see it has to work that
[4:48] way we we accept that from God yes well
[4:50] there's so many things he was saying I I
[4:53] I have 20 sermons go down there off what
[4:55] he said I was thinking here of one
[4:58] little illustration to back back up what
[5:00] he said now we look at this watch to
[5:03] find out what time it is unless that
[5:06] every instrument in that watch is
[5:08] coordinating one with the other we'll
[5:10] never know the correct time amen is that
[5:13] right and that takes all of us all
[5:16] together if we want to see the third
[5:18] pool really do something for God it's
[5:20] coordination with every one of us
[5:22] together to humle ourselves before God
[5:25] and confess our wrongs and pray and
[5:28] believe God these things I truly believe
[5:31] that what brother B said is the truth
[5:34] that God will never put his spirit in
[5:37] Unholy unrighteous disobedient
[5:40] Temple it's got to come in the The Way
[5:44] of the cleansing of our hearts from all
[5:47] G and iniquity that we might be pure
[5:50] before God that he might work his pure
[5:53] Holy Spirit through us to bring these
[5:55] things to pass I I think that when you
[5:58] go home tonight if you read that little
[6:00] book of Jude you just learn a whole lot
[6:02] now of what brother B said and he said
[6:05] and I earnestly contend for the faith
[6:08] that was once delivered to the saints
[6:10] that got away from it how a man of
[6:12] corrupt mind and so forth that come in
[6:15] and beile him away from the from the
[6:17] real things of God and God can only
[6:21] operate as we let him operat and so many
[6:25] wonderful things about saying U you know
[6:28] people are want Power
[6:30] and really they don't know what power is
[6:33] amen they don't really know what what
[6:35] what goes with it the the Way Up Is Down
[6:39] always you if you want Power see how
[6:42] humble you can get just get away from
[6:45] all your worldly thinking and humble
[6:48] yourself before God and then you got
[6:50] more power than the man that runs all
[6:52] over the building and makes a big lot of
[6:54] noise because you have been able to
[6:57] conquer yourself and commit yourself to
[7:00] Christ see to humble yourself before him
[7:03] that's really a power you show me a
[7:06] church that's humble real humble not a a
[7:11] irant a church just a sweet Humble
[7:14] Church I'll show you a church that has
[7:15] the favor and power of God Amen that's
[7:18] that's the thing it takes hum humility
[7:21] humbling ourselves before God letting
[7:24] God just work to us don't have to make a
[7:26] lot of
[7:27] noise uh sometimes as the farmer said he
[7:31] went out to the field with his wagon and
[7:33] every time he hit a bump it just rattled
[7:35] and went on but when he come back he h
[7:37] the same bump didn't make no noise at
[7:39] all because it's loaded with good things
[7:41] so I think that's about right that we
[7:44] get filled up with the good things of
[7:46] God that the fruit of the spirit might
[7:48] be known through us as he referred so
[7:50] much to 1 Corinthians 13 there how that
[7:53] oh I get my body be burnt and have all
[7:56] these things and have not charity it's
[7:58] nothing profits me nothing you see we
[8:00] want to do that above all things it's
[8:02] our individual Souls that we're
[8:05] responsible before God see it's it's you
[8:08] going to have it it isn't whether I go
[8:10] or he goes It's You Going see it you
[8:14] first and you've got to look this out
[8:16] and come sweet before the Lord and I've
[8:18] always found out that the man that
[8:20] humbles himself is the man that God
[8:22] exalts when you take a person with his
[8:25] chest out knows everything you can't
[8:28] tell him nothing and his ear and and
[8:30] well that that's the person that never
[8:31] gets anywhere but you take that person
[8:33] that humbles themselves and walks
[8:35] sweetly I was talking to a man to the
[8:37] DAT it's just organized in the church up
[8:40] at the uh uh pulled out of an
[8:42] organization that had been uh well
[8:44] brother Bose and then church where they
[8:47] they had that great church there for so
[8:50] long and the Lord is Blessing and the
[8:51] people got to a place that they want to
[8:53] polish up like the rest of them and want
[8:55] to throw it into an organization and
[8:57] when they did it just those most humble
[8:59] Christians in there did not want that
[9:01] all their life had been taught against
[9:03] it so they walked away from it now
[9:05] they've got a group and the Lord has
[9:06] blessed them until they're coming in up
[9:09] into a big place now again b a church
[9:11] now that puts up about 4 5,000 people
[9:15] and they're starting over and they come
[9:17] to me and said brother BR sitting right
[9:19] there in in the office the church office
[9:21] the other day and he said uh one of the
[9:23] leaders for the CL them said what must
[9:26] we do I said find a man to be a Shepherd
[9:30] that has no reputation in all
[9:32] denomination just a real good Janine
[9:36] sweet humble brother that lives a life
[9:38] God will take care of the rest of us I
[9:40] said a good pastor that feed the sheep
[9:43] and be humble and than God will do the
[9:45] rest if you not some big know- it alls
[9:48] coming he's going to put this in order
[9:49] and this has to be this way cutting
[9:51] things around it'll never work you just
[9:53] got through it that's it every piece in
[9:56] the church must work together and you
[9:58] must keep keep up your part of it so we
[10:01] can see what time we're living in we may
[10:03] be closer than we think we are now we
[10:05] appreciate for the veil don't we amen
[10:07] the Lord bless you by the veil thank you
[10:09] and we thank the Lord for bringing this
[10:11] great message to us tonight and I got a
[10:14] note a few minutes ago one of the
[10:15] sisters and had something she wanted to
[10:17] tell in a dream of you just write it out
[10:20] tell me sister um they give her some
[10:22] dreams that has been absolutely true we
[10:24] don't accept all dreams no but Wonder of
[10:27] God we want to know it it's God talking
[10:29] to it like everything speaks the tongues
[10:31] we don't believe it but when there's an
[10:33] interpretation comes that tells us
[10:34] something that's going to happen we see
[10:36] it happen and we thank the Lord part see
[10:38] we want to keep it running smoothly
[10:40] sweetly and in order uh of the Lord so
[10:42] just remember that your part may be the
[10:44] main spring or it may be the little uh
[10:48] some little hand or some little part of
[10:50] the winding stem whatever it may be or
[10:52] it may be the hands on the face the
[10:54] clock it tells the time but whatever it
[10:56] is it takes us all working together and
[10:58] harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[11:01] to bring this to P just think if gifts
[11:04] is so great what we call power and Paul
[11:07] said though I have faith that I can move
[11:09] them
[11:10] mountain and have not charity I am
[11:14] nothing am amen think of that and though
[11:18] you say well though I I understand I
[11:21] wish iing know the Bible though I
[11:23] understand all the mysteries of God see
[11:27] and still though I could do it and have
[11:29] not charity I I'm nothing see I haven't
[11:32] got no worry yet see the main thing is
[11:35] love God and humble yourself with it I
[11:38] surely uh after all these years on the
[11:42] field and around the world and seeing
[11:44] different people I ought know a little
[11:45] bit about the gate to enter in at and if
[11:48] you want to get somewhere with God never
[11:51] let a Iran Spirit ever come around don't
[11:55] let No Malice come in no matter what
[11:58] anybody's done if they are wrong don't
[12:00] you never build up a complex against
[12:02] that person you'd be sweet and kind
[12:05] remember God loved you when you were in
[12:08] sin if the spirit of God's in you you
[12:10] love the other person when he's in wrong
[12:13] just pray for them and love one another
[12:15] above everything love God and love one
[12:17] another and be humble with God and
[12:20] around one another and God will bless us
[12:22] and hard tell what he will do usually
[12:24] when Church begins to get numbers and
[12:26] get to getting a little bigger or
[12:27] something like that then they get away
[12:29] from that real thing the real thing you
[12:31] know what brought these things to pass
[12:33] when I first started the Lord appeared
[12:35] to me down the river and told me that
[12:37] brother B saw that I believe in a paper
[12:39] in Canada many years ago where that
[12:40] angel of Lord appeared on the river down
[12:42] there is on Associated Press Mystic
[12:45] light over a local Minister while
[12:47] baptized and and you know what I did
[12:50] that when we had the tent meeting just
[12:52] across the street a tent that seated
[12:54] about or 2 200 people ministers come
[12:57] from EV word and said brother come here
[12:59] a minute not just a boy but or just a
[13:02] kid and he said how do you keep those
[13:05] people in one ACC C they love one
[13:08] another till they I never seen people
[13:09] love one another that's the Lord that's
[13:12] what this church was established upon
[13:15] that Godly brotherly love for one
[13:18] another I see him even shake hands to
[13:20] one another leaving the place and cry
[13:22] like babies to leave one another they
[13:24] love one another that well and I could
[13:27] go to their house to visit them in time
[13:30] the Bible was laying open and stain with
[13:32] tears coming at night time where fathers
[13:34] and mothers was gathered together and
[13:36] there little children around on the
[13:38] floor kneeling around and fathers and
[13:40] mothers on their knees crying and
[13:42] praying and I'd stand at the door and
[13:44] waiting waiting wait and they didn't
[13:46] stop praying I just sat down on the
[13:47] steps and start praying myself waiting
[13:49] for see and that that was what and they
[13:51] love one another they love one another
[13:55] we used to stand and sing that old song
[13:56] blessed be the ti that binds our hearts
[13:59] in Christian love a fellowship of
[14:01] kindered mind is like to that above when
[14:03] we are Sunder part it gives us inward
[14:06] pain but we shall still be joined in
[14:08] heart and hope to meet again I say this
[14:11] with great joy in my heart to Christ
[14:13] many of them are sleeping around in
[14:15] these Graves marks t i waiting for that
[14:17] great Resurrection where we'll meet
[14:19] together again let not that Spirit ever
[14:22] depart from this place if it ever does
[14:24] then I don't care how eloquent your
[14:26] pastor might be how well he might bring
[14:28] the word of God the spirit of God is
[14:30] grieved away and we can have all things
[14:33] in Fellowship in common love one another
[14:37] then God will work with us and we're
[14:38] keeping time that the people come by and
[14:40] say if you want to see a church that's
[14:42] really humble a church that really loves
[14:45] God droing up there that Tabernacle one
[14:47] time and watch them look at the care
[14:49] they have for one another the respect
[14:51] when the gospels being preached how R
[14:54] how everything just in order then they
[14:57] can look and see what time we're living
[14:58] you'll see the spirit of God moving
[15:00] among you great signs and wonders and
[15:02] things will be taking place if the
[15:04] things working together it's telling the
[15:06] time but if it isn't working then time
[15:09] is stopped it won't tell the time no
[15:11] more so if we want to know what time
[15:13] we're living just start everybody
[15:15] working together in the gospel loving
[15:17] one another loving God and the hands
[15:19] itself will tell the time what we're
[15:21] amen do you believe
[15:23] that amen the Lord bless you real richly
[15:26] don't forget now get around this week

[15:50] faults one to another and pray one for
[15:52] another that we might be healed James
[15:54] 5:14 13141 15 that we must confess our
[15:58] false one to another before we even come

[16:29] consecrated life to come from to from

[16:34] express God to himself that's what made
[16:37] him what he was I've always said what
[16:39] made Jesus God to me was the way he
