[49:41] make the best of the service tonight

[50:05] uh we I'm sure we we we appreciate we
[50:10] appreciate our
[50:11] brother and uh
[50:17] uh he had a good service uh preaching
[50:20] for us on the
[50:23] weekend so uh let's turn to Acts chapter
[50:28] one Acts chapter
[50:32] one Acts chapter
[50:41] one the Lord is very gracious and he's
[50:45] uh the way he does his things is a kind
[50:48] of
[50:51] for surprise us
[50:54] amen
[50:56] but I pray that the Lord will be able to
[50:58] to help us as he have as he always does
[51:02] tonight we just want to bring a little
[51:03] talk to you and then uh
[51:07] uh uh on Sunday we will continue in
[51:11] their light praise the
[51:13] Lord I actually thought I will be in
[51:16] Arizona this uh this week for brother
[51:20] Doug Bob meeting and then I will preach
[51:23] for brother Ezra Paul but then
[51:25] uh some few things came up I just
[51:27] thought that okay uh maybe I'm not
[51:30] supposed to be there this time so uh
[51:34] that's why we are home and uh let's read
[51:38] from verse
[51:40] six let's read from verse
[51:45] 6 verse 6 of Acts chapter
[51:48] one and when sorry when they therefore
[51:53] were come together the they ask of him
[51:57] asking Jesus Jesus and his disciple
[51:59] saying Lord will there at this time
[52:03] restore again the Kingdom of Israel and
[52:07] and he said unto them it is not for you
[52:10] to know the times or the
[52:14] season which the father have put in his
[52:18] own power praise the Lord even though
[52:23] the the fullness
[52:26] of God was in Christ but yet there were
[52:29] things that the father held back from
[52:33] him praise the Lord when uh uh uh when
[52:38] the mother of uh uh James and John were
[52:42] asking to sit on his right hand and his
[52:44] left hand he said no it is not for me to
[52:47] give the father have not reveiled that
[52:49] to
[52:50] me praise the Lord so Jesus is is saying
[52:54] here you know uh it is it is now for you
[52:57] to know the time and the season which
[52:59] the father have put in his own power now
[53:03] that is the reason why Revelation 1
[53:06] verse one says there are the
[53:09] Revelation uh of Jesus that God gave to
[53:12] him so Jesus in the continuation of his
[53:16] ministry will now receive the full
[53:18] revelation of all things that will be
[53:22] revealed right there in the Book of
[53:24] Revelation let's read verse 8 but ye
[53:27] shall receive power after that the Holy
[53:30] Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be
[53:35] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[53:38] in Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[53:41] uttermost part of the earth and when he
[53:44] have spoken these things why they beh
[53:48] held he was taken up and a cloud
[53:53] received him out of their
[53:56] sight I wish I was there yes sir praise
[53:59] the Lord but I'm glad that I'm here
[54:04] amen yes sir and while they look
[54:08] steadfastly towards heaven as he went up
[54:12] behold two men
[54:14] sto by them in white
[54:17] aaral which also said ye men of G was
[54:22] stand ye gazing up into heaven
[54:25] the same Jesus which is taken up from
[54:29] you into heaven shall so come in like
[54:34] manner as ye have seen him go into
[54:38] heaven praise the Lord
[54:42] amen amen now is very is very
[54:46] amazing I don't think uh I didn't write
[54:49] the Bible neither did I think brother
[54:51] brandham wrote this Bible but whoever
[54:53] wrote this Bible put right under this
[54:56] verse that we have just read verse 11
[54:59] they put Daniel chapter 7:3 that's where
[55:02] we'll be studying tonight so let's just
[55:04] bow our heads and pray Heavenly Father
[55:07] we just want to thank you we are
[55:09] humbling our heart before you Lord few
[55:11] things we want to share there are uh
[55:15] morning events that are made clear by
[55:19] prophecy God I pray that Lord you would
[55:22] just envelope Us in tonight in your word
[55:26] precious Lord It's all about your word
[55:28] it's all about you it's all about what
[55:31] you have done and what you are doing oh
[55:34] God I pray give Grace Lord father it's a
[55:37] a subject that is we don't have enough
[55:40] time to be able to go by the time that
[55:42] is allotted to us may we do the best
[55:44] that we can to be able to say something
[55:46] that will draw us closer to you in Jesus
[55:49] name we pray amen the Lord bless you you
[55:52] may have your seat while we turn to
[55:54] Danel chapter 7 why you turn into Daniel
[55:57] chapter
[55:58] 7 and like I said uh uh many many of the
[56:02] Believers since around the world H are
[56:04] com
[56:06] commemorating uh uh uh February 28th
[56:10] that is that is very familiar to us
[56:13] until uh uh lately or some period of
[56:17] time uh uh February 28 came on a big
[56:21] attack there is there is there is no
[56:23] even around the message that is under so
[56:26] much of attack there in February 28th
[56:29] praise the Lord and uh and for me
[56:33] personally as long as I remain your
[56:35] pastor of this church until you vote me
[56:38] after the service vote me out after the
[56:40] service but praise the Lord
[56:45] amen that was one of the thing that
[56:48] inspired me to make that picture out
[56:50] there sir that I put out there right
[56:53] over the water fountain
[56:56] and uh I'll tell you more about that on
[56:58] on uh Sunday from my own personal
[57:01] inspiration and uh uh uh so so uh we
[57:08] know that uh February
[57:11] 28 uh uh before February 28 uh brother
[57:16] Brandon preached the message s is this
[57:18] the time and he explained to the church
[57:22] you know told the church about uh
[57:24] multiple visions that he had and other
[57:28] believers in the church brothers sisters
[57:30] that were coming to him with different
[57:32] Vision about going to the worst you know
[57:35] and and uh uh seven Vision in line I
[57:38] wish we had time to look at all of those
[57:40] seven Visions
[57:41] together but uh uh and it was all
[57:45] preparing for this great experience that
[57:49] was going to take place on that day
[57:51] where the uh uh uh seven angels came
[57:55] down you know uh uh giving brother
[57:58] brandham you know uh uh an instruction
[58:01] to return back to Jeffersonville for the
[58:03] opening of the seals and and what a
[58:06] tremendous experience it was many many
[58:08] turn to believe that there was a an
[58:11] explosion from an airlane praise the
[58:13] Lord amen it make it more mysterious for
[58:15] us amen praise the lord it's easy to
[58:19] believe that God did that than to
[58:21] believe that Aeroplane did
[58:23] that because if you believe that God
[58:26] because God can do everything amen he
[58:28] can do everything and anything so it's
[58:30] it's it's much easier to believe that uh
[58:33] it was God then to believe that that is
[58:35] Aeroplane because uh uh the the the the
[58:40] height of the Mist that sustained in the
[58:42] heavens and move all
[58:44] around and uh uh so uh um it was
[58:51] actually from this live magazine
[58:55] uh this is actually the May 17 the
[58:58] actual magazine that first published the
[59:02] the the the pictures you know first
[59:06] published it and called it mysterious
[59:08] Cloud uh uh uh back there in
[59:12] 1963 at that time they were selling it
[59:14] 25 cents I bought it more than 25
[59:17] cents praise the Lord and uh uh so uh uh
[59:22] this is the actual magazine that the
[59:24] that uh that published that and the
[59:27] brother bought the magazine and show it
[59:29] to brother Brandon so the picture that
[59:31] we have out there actually took
[59:33] everything right from you and uh uh to
[59:36] to be able to print it and make it big
[59:38] down there and just like I said I have
[59:40] my own my own reason for doing it praise
[59:44] the Lord because you see just like
[59:47] brother Brandon had three pools I
[59:49] believe that uh this pH of the message
[59:52] is the bride part of the message amen
[59:55] praise the Lord and uh and when we talk
[59:58] about the opening of the word it was it
[1:00:01] was Christ himself yes amen that came
[1:00:03] down and opened his word brother
[1:00:05] brandham had nothing to do with it you
[1:00:07] know he was just the man that was there
[1:00:09] but it was God that that came down and
[1:00:11] opened his word so you see the the
[1:00:14] beauty of this
[1:00:15] message is the Fulfillment of
[1:00:19] scripture that's the beauty of this
[1:00:21] message if you don't love your Bible you
[1:00:23] will not enjoy his message you might
[1:00:26] ride on uh you know the uh uh you know
[1:00:29] the dos and done that would be just for
[1:00:32] a while it will not
[1:00:34] last praise the Lord because the message
[1:00:37] go more beyond the dos and done is the
[1:00:40] very Life of Christ praise the Lord is
[1:00:43] the token Life of
[1:00:45] Christ so uh uh so I thought tonight
[1:00:51] that I will speak not majorly but I I I
[1:00:55] I want to bring a connection here and uh
[1:00:58] and that's what I want to talk about but
[1:01:00] before I do that let me read few few
[1:01:04] quotes to you the greatest new Flash in
[1:01:07] history let's let's just read that one
[1:01:10] and see what uh what brother Brandon
[1:01:12] said yeah he said the greatest new Flash
[1:01:16] in
[1:01:17] history praise the Lord he said so so it
[1:01:23] was a great time
[1:01:25] them glorious 40 days what is he talking
[1:01:28] about after Jesus
[1:01:32] resurrected he was here after he
[1:01:34] resurrected he never ascended
[1:01:36] immediately he was here with the
[1:01:39] disciples walking through the city of
[1:01:41] Jerusalem for 40
[1:01:45] days and in and in that period of time
[1:01:49] he was he was going through the walls
[1:01:51] because the Bible says the disciple were
[1:01:53] in the place the door was closed and the
[1:01:56] Lord came
[1:01:57] through God Amen when he walked with the
[1:02:00] two men on the road of EMAs he broke the
[1:02:02] bread their eyes came open and the Lord
[1:02:06] left so 40 days he was here on Earth
[1:02:10] that's what that's what he's referring
[1:02:12] to here and that's what the scripture
[1:02:14] taught
[1:02:15] us so so it was a great time then 40
[1:02:19] days how I will have loved to have been
[1:02:23] there
[1:02:24] praise the Lord seeing Abraham and Sarah
[1:02:28] walking through the
[1:02:30] streets because the Bible says the Old
[1:02:33] Testament sins resurrected sir this is
[1:02:36] not a feeble it's in the Bible that's
[1:02:38] what the Bible
[1:02:39] says amen Matthew chapter 27 you just go
[1:02:43] and read all down there you will see it
[1:02:45] this it's right there it's written in
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:48] scripture now as I was as I was thinking
[1:02:50] about this this morning this is this is
[1:02:52] the thing that is that that really
[1:02:54] caught my mind this morning 4:00 a.m. I
[1:02:57] woke up I came downstairs and and I was
[1:02:59] just thinking about February 28 that's
[1:03:01] why we sang that song Lord I want Lord I
[1:03:04] Thank thee praise the Lord and what I
[1:03:07] was going through my mind I was saying
[1:03:09] uh
[1:03:11] uh uh never lived through the time to
[1:03:15] see the uh uh brother
[1:03:18] Brandon and uh uh or to see some of the
[1:03:21] things that happen there on sunet
[1:03:23] mountain we've been uh reading the
[1:03:26] generation uh series of uh home for our
[1:03:30] devotion and uh uh and we're reading the
[1:03:33] testimony of uh brother Evans and he was
[1:03:36] testifying brother Brandon marish and D
[1:03:39] there that he's how how you know they
[1:03:41] were at The Filling Station brother
[1:03:43] Brandon mentioned that on tape and they
[1:03:45] saw the cloud going up and down and and
[1:03:47] and there were people that that you know
[1:03:50] that witnessed these things just like
[1:03:52] there were people we have just read in
[1:03:54] the Bible the Bible says while they were
[1:03:58] beholding they saw Jesus caught up in a
[1:04:02] cloud it was not a
[1:04:04] feeble people just like you and myself
[1:04:07] saw
[1:04:10] it Genesis Chapter 18 it's not just a
[1:04:14] story that Moses wrote Abraham saw three
[1:04:19] men coming to
[1:04:22] him praise the Lord it's not just a
[1:04:30] feble are we
[1:04:33] together now so he said how I would have
[1:04:37] loved to have been there but then
[1:04:41] thinking
[1:04:42] again that I did have I did have heart
[1:04:47] to be a
[1:04:48] believer because he did not
[1:04:52] appear to no one
[1:04:54] but his elected church so even if you
[1:04:57] were in the days of Jesus just like if
[1:05:00] you are living
[1:05:01] today if God didn't call you to believe
[1:05:05] that the Messiah was on Earth you will
[1:05:08] have lived your life and you will have
[1:05:10] known nothing about him it wouldn't have
[1:05:13] been your choice for you to follow
[1:05:16] Jesus Jesus called his disciples come
[1:05:19] follow
[1:05:20] me Matthew follow thou me so even if you
[1:05:24] were living in the days of
[1:05:28] Jesus if he did not call you you
[1:05:30] wouldn't have followed
[1:05:35] him are we together
[1:05:42] am but then thinking again that I they
[1:05:47] have had to be a believer because he did
[1:05:49] not appear to no one but his elected
[1:05:52] church he he only appeared to
[1:05:56] Believers and as he was then he cannot
[1:06:00] change to he cannot change today he
[1:06:03] still only appear to his elected Church
[1:06:09] Believers praise the Lord now we find
[1:06:12] that there were there were many who
[1:06:15] taught of maiah in those days and there
[1:06:19] were many who look for the coming Mah
[1:06:23] but he had a church that was elected so
[1:06:29] has he
[1:06:31] tonight praise the Lord I was looking on
[1:06:35] on Google this
[1:06:37] afternoon I was looking on Google for
[1:06:40] for what is commemorated today so all
[1:06:43] sorts of things today is pink day today
[1:06:47] is I mean all sorts of things they were
[1:06:49] commemorated chocolate day I saw today
[1:06:51] is worldwide chocolate day
[1:06:56] praise the
[1:06:59] Lord and you you know it's it it sounds
[1:07:03] a little bit funny but uh
[1:07:09] uh I remember when I was printing
[1:07:12] this I was doing it at at
[1:07:16] Michaels put trying to put in frame the
[1:07:18] one we have back
[1:07:20] there so the lady asked me what is this
[1:07:26] picture she look at the picture she says
[1:07:29] she says she says what is this it looked
[1:07:32] mysterious I said that's what it is you
[1:07:34] are seeing it you know a rink of
[1:07:38] mystery you know she says I've never
[1:07:41] seen this in my life but it just looked
[1:07:43] like you're just looking at it you know
[1:07:46] it it it draws your attention you know
[1:07:48] and then I started telling her a little
[1:07:50] bit about it but uh don't want to spend
[1:07:52] all the Wednesday night tonight let's
[1:07:54] just read another thought on the same uh
[1:07:57] Direction here uh invisible
[1:08:00] Union of the bride of Christ I set in it
[1:08:04] who have loved to have been here during
[1:08:08] the time of his visit on the earth
[1:08:11] during Jesus time of his physical visit
[1:08:14] on the Earth but still I think this
[1:08:19] right
[1:08:20] now is a greater time praise the Lord
[1:08:25] why makes it a greater
[1:08:27] time because even if if we were here at
[1:08:31] the time Jesus was here many of the
[1:08:34] things that he said never fulfilled at
[1:08:37] the time he was
[1:08:40] here praise the
[1:08:42] Lord many of the things that he said H H
[1:08:46] Matthew chapter 24 he was there he was
[1:08:49] telling them how how uh this c will be
[1:08:52] in Cal you know uh uh uh you know and
[1:08:56] and then how uh there will be desolation
[1:08:59] there will be farming and and people
[1:09:00] will eat their own children he was
[1:09:02] saying it never happened at the time he
[1:09:04] was there he ascended couple of years
[1:09:07] later before the the Roman generous
[1:09:09] Titus and come about so you see living
[1:09:12] in the time that he was making the
[1:09:15] prophecy is not more is not more a
[1:09:18] blessing than living in the time where
[1:09:21] the prophecy is fulfilled right
[1:09:26] praise the Lord amen living in the time
[1:09:30] where the prophecy is
[1:09:33] fulfilled this day this scripture is
[1:09:36] fulfilled amen are we together amen so I
[1:09:41] I would have loved to have been during
[1:09:42] the time he visited the Earth but still
[1:09:45] I think
[1:09:47] this right now is a greater time because
[1:09:50] it's a time that he's coming to take
[1:09:54] the people that he
[1:09:57] redeemed nearing the resurrection when
[1:10:00] all the redeemed will come forth what a
[1:10:03] glorious opportunity we have to speak to
[1:10:09] a dying people a great
[1:10:12] time we are entrusted about it now so uh
[1:10:17] uh
[1:10:18] uh uh just like I
[1:10:22] said
[1:10:25] I would have loved to have been in the
[1:10:28] time that this uh
[1:10:31] uh uh mystery Cloud was taking in all of
[1:10:36] that but I'm glad to be here I'm glad to
[1:10:39] be in this time uh to be able to to see
[1:10:44] it praise the Lord to realize that the
[1:10:47] millions around the world and and not
[1:10:51] not only around the world but even to
[1:10:53] realize realiz there are many that are
[1:10:55] sitting even in message churches and
[1:10:57] don't really understand uh what what
[1:11:00] this was all
[1:11:02] about that's that that is the big
[1:11:05] confusion praise the Lord amen the day
[1:11:09] that Jesus
[1:11:11] died that day there were more scriptures
[1:11:15] that were fulfilled about Jesus then all
[1:11:19] of the time of his
[1:11:22] ministry
[1:11:24] the day that he died there were more
[1:11:27] scriptures in the Old
[1:11:29] Testament that were
[1:11:32] fulfilled about
[1:11:34] him right from Genesis coming down to
[1:11:39] Malachi are we together so let's go to
[1:11:43] uh uh uh Daniel chapter 7
[1:11:46] tonight like I said we will speak uh a
[1:11:49] little more on uh on this on Sunday if
[1:11:52] God G give us the the the grace amen
[1:11:56] praise the Lord we'll speak uh a little
[1:11:59] more on uh on uh on the
[1:12:08] cloud are we
[1:12:11] together now Daniel chapter
[1:12:13] 7 in Daniel chapter 7 tonight what
[1:12:17] actually we talking about is Asian of
[1:12:20] day because it's the only chapter in the
[1:12:23] Bible
[1:12:24] where that title of God was
[1:12:27] used Asian of day it was used three
[1:12:31] times in Daniel chapter
[1:12:35] 7 and it was used
[1:12:38] under it was used under uh H H A
[1:12:42] peculiar circumstances it was used under
[1:12:45] a peculiar Vision that Daniel had praise
[1:12:50] the Lord So Daniel chapter 7
[1:12:54] let's look at verse 9 Daniel chapter 7
[1:12:58] let's look at verse 9 and I beheld till
[1:13:01] the trones were cast down I beheld till
[1:13:06] the Thrones were cast down and the Asian
[1:13:10] of
[1:13:11] days they
[1:13:16] s his Gard men was white as
[1:13:21] snow and the head of his head like a
[1:13:26] pure World his throne
[1:13:29] was like a a fair flame and his wheels
[1:13:34] as burning
[1:13:36] fire praise the Lord that's one of the
[1:13:40] verse we will go into more details on
[1:13:42] Sunday just want to pick up the three
[1:13:44] verses verse 13 is the second time asan
[1:13:48] of De was used like I said or Through
[1:13:51] the Bible the only time this title of uh
[1:13:55] of Elohim or the only time the title of
[1:13:57] God Asian of day was used was right in
[1:14:00] this
[1:14:02] chapter verse
[1:14:04] 13 I saw in the N
[1:14:08] vision and behold one like the son of
[1:14:13] man came with the clouds of
[1:14:17] heaven and came to the Asian of
[1:14:20] days
[1:14:22] now for a long time I was confused on
[1:14:25] this
[1:14:27] verse praise the Lord why because these
[1:14:31] are two
[1:14:33] titles these are two titles of
[1:14:36] God he's called the son of man amen he's
[1:14:41] called the Asian of day this were two
[1:14:45] titles of
[1:14:46] God merging
[1:14:50] blending praise the Lord and recently
[1:14:54] H uh uh brother Elijah that preached for
[1:14:56] us his younger brother is over in
[1:14:58] Philadelphia Samuel you know we he he we
[1:15:01] talk all the time he will will talk
[1:15:03] about scriptural things so I fell on the
[1:15:07] Old Mill I don't remember uh that should
[1:15:09] be back uh uh uh even before I came to
[1:15:12] the state so they should be around uh
[1:15:16] ear 2,000 that I sent to brother Loney
[1:15:21] Jenkins on this very
[1:15:24] scripture praise the Lord so I wrote him
[1:15:26] I I said I said brother Lon uh uh
[1:15:30] because we we he was a good friend of
[1:15:32] mine we always uh you know uh share
[1:15:35] scriptures you know we would talk and
[1:15:37] and uh so I sent I sent him a mail that
[1:15:40] I saw the mail
[1:15:42] recently so I I sent him a mail and I
[1:15:44] asked him I say I say for why I been
[1:15:47] I've been in trouble on this uh because
[1:15:49] there there are two titles of Our Lord
[1:15:52] in this
[1:15:54] verse and uh how do we now the thing
[1:15:57] about it there in the in in the back
[1:15:59] part of my mind even as a young uh uh uh
[1:16:04] uh as a young preacher a young believer
[1:16:06] in the back part of my mind it's it it
[1:16:10] could be very easy for me to associate
[1:16:12] it with uh with the cloud could be very
[1:16:15] easy for me to associate with the cloud
[1:16:17] but I did not know how to explain
[1:16:20] it in my mind I've always always told
[1:16:23] myself if there is one scripture
[1:16:26] Biblical scripture that explain February
[1:16:29] 28th is this
[1:16:35] scripture praise the
[1:16:37] Lord we'll see a little we'll see a
[1:16:39] little more on that uh uh on uh uh on
[1:16:44] Sunday praise the
[1:16:47] Lord
[1:16:50] amen on Sunday we will go go go into
[1:16:53] into some some details since we don't we
[1:16:56] don't have all the time
[1:16:58] tonight
[1:17:00] uh praise the Lord I lost my place here
[1:17:03] okay now
[1:17:06] so verse 13
[1:17:08] again um I saw in a night
[1:17:12] vision and behold one like the son of
[1:17:15] man came with clouds of heaven and came
[1:17:19] to the asan of day and they brought him
[1:17:23] di before him amen and and there was
[1:17:29] given him dominion and glory and Kingdom
[1:17:33] that all people Nation language should
[1:17:37] serve him now so you see this whole
[1:17:40] Daniel chapter 7 when you look at the
[1:17:43] three times the Asian of day was used it
[1:17:47] went it went
[1:17:49] before the
[1:17:51] time uh uh uh of of of the
[1:17:54] Millennium praise the Lord it goes into
[1:17:57] the
[1:17:59] Millennium and it goes after the
[1:18:03] Millennium now you you really have to be
[1:18:07] able to to uh to you know to look at the
[1:18:11] verses and really be able to place it in
[1:18:14] their time
[1:18:17] sequence because many of the time just
[1:18:20] like in your dreams when you dream
[1:18:23] Dre sometimes is not really in
[1:18:30] sequence as you think it
[1:18:32] is praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:18:36] sometimes in your dream you think like
[1:18:38] Oh I thought I was I thought it was in
[1:18:40] the
[1:18:42] morning praise the Lord I thought in my
[1:18:45] dream I thought it was in the afternoon
[1:18:47] but I was in my night
[1:18:49] gown so I got a little bit confused
[1:18:52] because I thought the sun was up but I
[1:18:54] it looks like I will stay in my in my
[1:18:56] night
[1:18:58] gowns so was it in the night was it in
[1:19:01] the morning because it's sometimes it's
[1:19:03] not really in the time sequence as we as
[1:19:07] you look at it and there are two
[1:19:10] scriptures two books in the Bible that
[1:19:13] are like that the Book of Revelation as
[1:19:16] you see the chapter going is not really
[1:19:20] in the chapter is not in sequence like
[1:19:22] the way the events are
[1:19:27] happening praise the Lord am
[1:19:33] amen when we were uh uh playing the
[1:19:36] beginning and ending of the Gentile
[1:19:38] dispensation I spoke on both the Book of
[1:19:40] Daniel and the Book of Revelation just
[1:19:42] bringing some bden pieces of how the the
[1:19:46] the are similarity they H they hold the
[1:19:49] mystery The Book of Daniel hold the
[1:19:51] mystery to the Jewish Redemption and the
[1:19:54] Book of Revelation hold the mystery to
[1:19:56] the Gentile Church
[1:19:59] Redemption praise the Lord and that's
[1:20:02] the reason why many people get confused
[1:20:04] reading the book of Revelation because
[1:20:07] they think they are following the
[1:20:09] sequence of events but it looks like
[1:20:11] when they get to a certain place it
[1:20:13] looks like well I thought this was
[1:20:15] supposed to happen before
[1:20:19] this and that is the very same thing
[1:20:22] that is taking place right here in the
[1:20:24] book of uh in the Book of Daniel if you
[1:20:27] read from verse one in in in chapter 7
[1:20:31] you will realize Daniel is talking about
[1:20:33] all of these all of these beasts all of
[1:20:35] these these uh uh uh mysterial beasts
[1:20:38] that that you know that type the the the
[1:20:41] Gentile Kingdom all of these Beast he
[1:20:43] talking about them and then right in the
[1:20:46] midst of that then he brings in this
[1:20:49] character called the Asian of day
[1:20:53] praise the Lord and and and when you
[1:20:56] look at the sequence of things that is
[1:20:59] happening here the asan of De is is uh
[1:21:03] is
[1:21:05] uh is an attribute is a is uh
[1:21:09] identification of God that is associated
[1:21:13] with end time
[1:21:18] judgment praise the
[1:21:20] Lord amen that is associated with end
[1:21:24] time judgment because when you look at
[1:21:27] uh uh let me let me just let me just uh
[1:21:31] read something
[1:21:32] here just to be able to to uh uh get on
[1:21:38] our mind a little bit uh when we go back
[1:21:40] to verse 9 I beheld till the truns were
[1:21:44] cast down now now uh uh in in in in in
[1:21:49] one in one place brother brandom
[1:21:51] interpreted this as the the the the
[1:21:54] Thrones the the the the powers of the
[1:21:58] word coming to their
[1:22:01] end praise the
[1:22:03] Lord because before Jesus would come and
[1:22:07] ruled Every Nation must come to its
[1:22:12] End Amen so beheld till the Thrones were
[1:22:17] cast down and the Asian of day did sit
[1:22:22] then his Throne was now erected when all
[1:22:24] other Thrones were cast
[1:22:29] down now so when when when you look at
[1:22:33] that whose garment was what I snowed his
[1:22:36] head uh uh uh like uh pure world and the
[1:22:40] throne was like a fair flame and the
[1:22:42] wheel was burning and the fairy stream
[1:22:44] issued and came forth from before him
[1:22:49] thousand thousands Minister unto him and
[1:22:53] and and 10,000 time 10,000 stood before
[1:22:57] him and joshman was set and the books
[1:23:02] were
[1:23:04] open so you see that is the only time
[1:23:08] isan of day was ever talked about it's
[1:23:11] related to
[1:23:12] judgment it's related to end time
[1:23:17] judgment from from the time where uh uh
[1:23:20] uh God WRA
[1:23:23] will Begin to
[1:23:25] Fall
[1:23:27] gradually from the be from the time
[1:23:30] where the wrath of God will Begin to
[1:23:32] Fall
[1:23:34] gradually I mean you don't need any kind
[1:23:37] of a vision or more uh H uh uh you know
[1:23:41] uh spiritual insight for you to realize
[1:23:44] that the word is under the wrath of God
[1:23:48] with all of the things that are
[1:23:49] happening but it had a beginning time
[1:23:55] which go back to Revelation 10 when that
[1:23:58] angel begin to sign time shall be no
[1:24:04] more time shall be no
[1:24:09] more so right from that time right from
[1:24:13] that time onto the white room judgment
[1:24:17] is a period of time that that
[1:24:20] manifestation of God there asan of
[1:24:24] day praise the
[1:24:27] Lord amen the one who existed before
[1:24:32] days that's what Asian of day means he
[1:24:35] existed before time he's Before Time and
[1:24:38] before
[1:24:42] days now let's follow me in a little bit
[1:24:45] here and uh and and and
[1:24:48] uh the books were said he says uh verse
[1:24:51] 11 I beheld then because of the voice of
[1:24:56] the of the great words which the horns
[1:24:59] speak I beheld even till the Beast was
[1:25:02] slain and his body destroyed and and
[1:25:07] giving to the Burning Flame now so you
[1:25:10] see you go back to the Book of
[1:25:12] Revelation then you understand the horns
[1:25:15] he's talking about you understand the
[1:25:18] Beast that were destroyed you understand
[1:25:20] where his body was burned
[1:25:24] all of that is all part of the
[1:25:30] Judgment praise the
[1:25:32] lord it's all part of the Judgment
[1:25:35] that's where now you will understand and
[1:25:38] uh uh when brother Bram started talking
[1:25:41] about what took place on February 28th
[1:25:44] he associated with the supreme authority
[1:25:47] the Supreme Jorge he said they always
[1:25:49] wear that
[1:25:51] week
[1:25:53] amen right here Daniel is saying His
[1:25:56] Garment in verse 9 what I snow his head
[1:26:00] uh uh uh uh uh uh and the head of his
[1:26:03] head was as pure wall you go back to
[1:26:06] Revelation chapter one that is the same
[1:26:08] way Jesus was identified in the midst of
[1:26:11] the seven golden candles
[1:26:19] stick are we together
[1:26:24] amen now you see because the way the
[1:26:27] church word presented judgment they
[1:26:32] presented
[1:26:33] judgment uh uh with a scene of total
[1:26:37] chaos and destruction that that that is
[1:26:41] the end of all of of of
[1:26:44] everything but as you look through the
[1:26:47] scripture you will realize that uh even
[1:26:51] you go back and read The Book of Ezekiel
[1:26:53] you go back and read the history of
[1:26:55] Israel you realize that when God was
[1:26:58] bringing judgment on his people he
[1:27:00] brings it you know he brings he brings
[1:27:03] he brings events that serve as warning
[1:27:05] to the
[1:27:08] people
[1:27:10] amen there will be earthquakes the moon
[1:27:13] will turn to blood and all of that all
[1:27:15] of those are serving as signs of warning
[1:27:18] end time
[1:27:21] judgment
[1:27:28] are we
[1:27:29] together okay I'm just just trying to
[1:27:32] run through that we'll preach on Sunday
[1:27:33] if the Lord T you now so verse 11 verse
[1:27:38] 12 said as concerning the rest of the
[1:27:41] Beast they have their dominions taken
[1:27:44] away yet their lives were prolonged for
[1:27:47] a for a season in time now verse 13 now
[1:27:50] brings us to this place where the son of
[1:27:53] man is he came to the asan of day and
[1:27:56] they brought him they brought him near
[1:27:58] before him now the third time Asian of
[1:28:02] day was used in uh in in in this chapter
[1:28:06] in the Bible will be uh uh in verse
[1:28:10] 22 in verse 22 now if you go back and
[1:28:14] read verse 21 before you come to
[1:28:17] 22 uh let's read from verse 20 and of
[1:28:20] the 10 horns that were in his head
[1:28:24] revelation will tell what the 10 horn is
[1:28:27] and of the other which came and and and
[1:28:31] before whom three fell even of that horn
[1:28:36] that that her eyes and the mouth that
[1:28:40] speak very great things whose look was
[1:28:45] more sh then his fellow that's that
[1:28:47] mysterious beaste that took the
[1:28:49] combination of the three amen men I
[1:28:53] beheld and the same horn make war with
[1:28:58] the
[1:29:00] Saints and
[1:29:02] Prevail against them until the Asian of
[1:29:06] day Asian of days came and judgment was
[1:29:11] given to the Saints of the most high
[1:29:14] praise the Lord the sin shall Jud the
[1:29:17] word so all of that so I'm just trying
[1:29:20] to set a scene here so you you can see
[1:29:23] what was happening now now you will see
[1:29:25] now when you go back to S uh uh uh is
[1:29:29] this the time in brother Bram talking
[1:29:31] where he says uh you know uh uh judgment
[1:29:34] is set for the West Coast he said I
[1:29:36] threw the dust in the air and there was
[1:29:38] an explosion all of those things were
[1:29:40] setting the scene for end time
[1:29:46] judgment are we
[1:29:48] together amen are you seeing the picture
[1:29:52] I read something to you here before I I
[1:29:55] close there's uh there's a lot we could
[1:29:57] look at
[1:29:59] together but
[1:30:02] uh I'm just trying to set the scene
[1:30:07] here and uh and it was it was uh uh
[1:30:12] today 61 years now since that experience
[1:30:16] on February 28
[1:30:20] 1963 you can just see how
[1:30:23] far we have come yes sir that will tell
[1:30:27] you why the word is becoming what it is
[1:30:31] it will tell you why we having all the
[1:30:34] shooting all the killing it will tell
[1:30:36] you not one nation is
[1:30:39] spell now one
[1:30:46] nation because all kiddom will have to
[1:30:50] fall
[1:30:56] praise the
[1:31:01] Lord are we
[1:31:12] together I hope you know that this is
[1:31:14] not to scare you this is just to let you
[1:31:17] know what time we are in because it's
[1:31:19] the time that we are in praise the Lord
[1:31:21] Lord amen this is is to remind you it's
[1:31:25] not to scare you the things on the news
[1:31:27] if they don't scare you they should not
[1:31:28] scare you that's
[1:31:31] right this this is just to remind you
[1:31:34] what what we we we are under a time of
[1:31:37] God's
[1:31:40] raft the day of the Lord when the Bible
[1:31:42] talks about the day of the
[1:31:45] Lord it was a day of
[1:31:50] judgment
[1:31:52] praise the lord it's just like when God
[1:31:55] was bringing his judgment on on on Egypt
[1:31:59] he never took he never took uh the
[1:32:01] Hebrews out of the land before the
[1:32:03] Judgment start falling the Hebrews were
[1:32:06] there when the 10 plag were
[1:32:11] falling they were there when all the
[1:32:13] firstborn uh uh died they could hear the
[1:32:16] crying and yelling every
[1:32:19] word but you see what God did he
[1:32:21] gathered his elected people in a in a in
[1:32:24] a special place called Gan sir while
[1:32:28] there were Darkness every
[1:32:31] word he was the
[1:32:36] light that Pillar of Fire was right
[1:32:39] there in Egypt providing life for the
[1:32:41] people to lead them out of
[1:32:44] Egypt and if we are in a time of an
[1:32:46] exitor that is the very same thing that
[1:32:49] we are Darkness all around now the light
[1:32:53] we have in Gan is God's promised word

[1:38:48] part of the scripture there amen that in
[1:38:51] the Fulfillment of this
[1:38:54] prophecy it were two Ministry that was
[1:38:57] Blended
[1:38:59] together amen it were two Ministry that
[1:39:03] was Blended together like if you take uh
[1:39:06] uh there in the church his boy brother
[1:39:08] Bram says uh according to Malachi 4 H uh
[1:39:13] uh he will he will turn the heart of the

[1:39:18] according to revelation 10:7 he will
[1:39:21] reveal the mystery of the seals praise
[1:39:25] the Lord but it will take this Divine
[1:39:28] mystery truth to
[1:39:31] literally that's right praise the Lord
[1:39:34] amen so you seeing there uh uh two two
[1:39:38] two separate prophecy being fulfilled on
[1:39:41] one Ministry to be able to achieve the
[1:39:44] purpose of turning our heart back to the
[1:39:49] fathers the Lord are we together
[1:39:55] amen so there is a there is there is a
[1:39:58] blending year of the son of man coming
[1:40:00] to the Asian of
[1:40:06] day we will look up more of that on
[1:40:08] Sunday if if the Lord help
[1:40:11] us I've seen another another direction
[1:40:14] to go into but uh uh we we just trust
[1:40:18] the Lord you pray for me and watch him
[1:40:22] blend these two together all right come
[1:40:26] to the Asian of days who head was white
[1:40:29] as snow and John
[1:40:32] turned and he saw one like the son of
[1:40:37] man praise the
[1:40:41] Lord
[1:40:47] amen he saw one like the Son of Man
[1:40:50] Standing in the midst of the seven
[1:40:53] golden candles
[1:40:56] stick with a snow white head the George
[1:41:01] not not gather around the waist but
[1:41:04] gather over the pipes up here at
[1:41:08] George praise the Lord right
[1:41:12] amen and then you go up go about and
[1:41:15] talks about the supreme
[1:41:19] authority
[1:41:23] and that place of the supreme authority
[1:41:25] is where now Christ is holding every one
[1:41:29] of us every nation everything created
[1:41:32] he's holding them accountable to his
[1:41:35] word yes sir we are not giving account
[1:41:38] to
[1:41:39] Nations we are giving account to
[1:41:43] him because he created all for his
[1:41:48] purpose we're going to give account to
[1:41:50] him
[1:41:53] we are accountable to the one that
[1:41:54] brought us
[1:41:59] here praise the
[1:42:01] Lord amen well now
[1:42:04] Jesus he
[1:42:06] created a resting place for us there is
[1:42:09] no condemnation to them that are in
[1:42:13] Christ they have passed from Death onto
[1:42:18] life
[1:42:19] amen
[1:42:21] so we we Face our
[1:42:25] judgment for our past present and future
[1:42:29] sins we Face their judgment by our
[1:42:33] attitude to the
[1:42:37] word every time we read the word every
[1:42:41] time we hear the word what we do with
[1:42:48] faith praise the Lord
[1:42:52] because that that is the place of the
[1:42:55] Asian of day the one W was before
[1:43:00] everything and that is the that is the
[1:43:02] subject we've been talking about in the
[1:43:04] beginning was the word that's the asan
[1:43:07] of day the asan of day is the
[1:43:12] word that's the reason why in his
[1:43:15] manifestation he's holding every nation
[1:43:18] under his word he said what I what did
[1:43:21] you do with my
[1:43:22] word in your nation in your home in your
[1:43:28] state he's holding Every Nation every
[1:43:32] Throne every
[1:43:34] Power is now giving account to the
[1:43:44] word are we together so you see when
[1:43:48] brother brandham said that when the the
[1:43:50] seals were open the Bible became a new
[1:43:54] book it was not just a
[1:43:57] slogan no the truth of God was revealed
[1:44:02] to bring us to
[1:44:06] life
[1:44:10] amen amen it was to bring us to
[1:44:15] life it was to bring us to the place of
[1:44:19] of uh of of recation and an identity
[1:44:22] where we can look right into the
[1:44:25] word to be able to pass from Death onto
[1:44:31] life Peter said judgment begin in the
[1:44:34] house of God and if God will scarcely if
[1:44:38] the righteous will be
[1:44:41] scarcely saved as they come through
[1:44:43] their judgment as God examined our life
[1:44:46] by the
[1:44:49] word praise the
[1:44:54] Lord amen let me let me say
[1:44:58] something and uh uh you know I was
[1:45:01] sitting there on Sunday sitting right
[1:45:04] here and brother Elijah was preaching
[1:45:05] just like I said I heard him on the
[1:45:08] phone in the morning and he was he was
[1:45:11] uh you know uh
[1:45:14] uh he was uh talking you know dealing
[1:45:18] with something back home and I was
[1:45:20] wondering what was what was going on so
[1:45:22] and I realized that he was talking to to
[1:45:24] some folks I think they they had a
[1:45:26] family you know dealing with a family in
[1:45:28] his church and and all of that but we
[1:45:31] didn't talk about it on our way to
[1:45:33] church but for some reason I I I could
[1:45:36] just see that he was you know he was
[1:45:38] tense he was nervous because he's coming
[1:45:40] to preach and Y say he he have already
[1:45:42] you have already been tuned up and just
[1:45:45] to see how the Holy Spirit led him
[1:45:50] praise praise the Lord and then he just
[1:45:53] he just dwell on family family family
[1:45:56] family I was sitting right there I was
[1:45:58] saying oh
[1:46:00] God I was just saying oh God how you
[1:46:03] know our
[1:46:05] needs praise the Lord I said oh God how
[1:46:08] you know our need you for me I I don't
[1:46:12] care what people would
[1:46:13] think because if you know me I'm not I'm
[1:46:17] not I'm not a I'm not one that hire them
[1:46:20] I'm not I don't hire preachers to come
[1:46:22] and preach for me that's right hire them
[1:46:25] and tell them what to preach I don't do
[1:46:26] that that's right if you know me I don't
[1:46:28] do that so I don't care what you
[1:46:31] think my conscience is right before God
[1:46:34] but
[1:46:36] but the thing about it there is
[1:46:39] there uh even as an
[1:46:42] assembly I see for a while how the
[1:46:47] enemy started attacking our homes
[1:46:52] yes praise the Lord
[1:46:56] amen different families and different
[1:46:58] things been going on and and all of that
[1:47:01] and and uh
[1:47:04] uh
[1:47:05] um but I was sitting right there and I
[1:47:08] was just saying oh God thank you for
[1:47:10] your word whatever you are doing do it
[1:47:14] quickly whatever you are doing you know
[1:47:17] I I was just I was just hearing in my in
[1:47:20] in my subconscious help is on the way I
[1:47:22] say glory be to God I was just hearing
[1:47:26] help is on the way amen I say oh Lord
[1:47:28] thank you help is on the way praise the
[1:47:32] Lord
[1:47:36] but that's the place where we
[1:47:39] are that's the time that we are living
[1:47:43] in you know we can we can we can we can
[1:47:46] go and talk about the cloud and and get
[1:47:48] into the argument brother Brandon was
[1:47:50] there brother Brandon was not there it
[1:47:52] does not to me to me that's not an
[1:47:54] argument for me that's
[1:47:57] right what is important to me is that a
[1:48:01] scripture being
[1:48:03] fulfilled I can bring that even to a
[1:48:10] scripture praise the
[1:48:12] Lord amen it just happened to be William
[1:48:17] Brams whose Ministry fall in line with
[1:48:20] the
[1:48:21] that if it if it was not and God choose
[1:48:25] Joseph Brown Joseph Brown will be the
[1:48:26] one who will be
[1:48:28] cting whoever Joseph Brown
[1:48:31] is so my my my part of it I'm I'm not in
[1:48:35] the
[1:48:36] argument because to me what this message
[1:48:39] is is the Fulfillment of
[1:48:44] scripture praise the
[1:48:46] lord it's the Fulfillment of scripture
[1:48:50] what what has been said about this age
[1:48:53] what God has promised about this age he
[1:48:56] promised that he will get a
[1:48:58] bride and that scripture is
[1:49:02] fulfilled amen
[1:49:05] amen praise the Lord he promised there
[1:49:08] will be a manifestation of the sons of
[1:49:10] God and that scripture is fulfilled
[1:49:18] amen and you watch in Jesus ministry
[1:49:22] what was he doing to the disciples he
[1:49:24] was spending much of the time reminding
[1:49:28] them what is
[1:49:30] written in the psalm in you have heard
[1:49:35] that it is written but now I say unto
[1:49:40] you praise the
[1:49:42] Lord he was trying to say we are in a
[1:49:45] time where the Old Testament scripture
[1:49:48] is fulfilled that's the reason why St
[1:49:51] John Chapter 2 when he when he Whi and
[1:49:53] turned the table over the Bible says the
[1:49:56] disciples they were looking at one
[1:49:57] another and it came to their mind what
[1:50:00] is written in the psalm the Zeal of the
[1:50:04] house has eaten Me Up When God moved in
[1:50:07] every generation when God moved when God
[1:50:10] moved in the time of Luther by putting
[1:50:13] the the the the Tes on the wall it was a
[1:50:15] fulfillment of scripture yes
[1:50:18] sir God don't move to the church God
[1:50:21] don't move to start a denomination God
[1:50:23] move to fulfill his word and whenever
[1:50:27] God moving in your life is to bring his
[1:50:30] word to pass because you are a son of
[1:50:33] God you are a daughter of God he's
[1:50:36] moving to to raise you
[1:50:39] up because when the enemy come as a Flor
[1:50:42] he raise up a standard you cannot raise
[1:50:44] the standard he raised the standard
[1:50:47] because his word is the standard that
[1:50:49] the devil that is above every other
[1:50:58] standard are we
[1:51:00] together just like how it was in Egypt
[1:51:04] judgment were falling plagues for
[1:51:08] falling
[1:51:11] amen can you think about that I'll say
[1:51:14] this in our close just just think about
[1:51:15] this now God gave Egypt 10 PL
[1:51:21] when he brought his people out he gave
[1:51:24] them Ten
[1:51:26] Commandments and the Ten Commandment was
[1:51:29] his
[1:51:34] word
[1:51:40] amen the plagues were falling the
[1:51:42] Judgment water turning into blood frogs
[1:51:44] all over the place sicknesses power
[1:51:47] breaking up all over their body
[1:51:52] but yet God people were preparing to go
[1:51:55] into the
[1:51:56] land of the
[1:52:01] promise are we
[1:52:04] together
