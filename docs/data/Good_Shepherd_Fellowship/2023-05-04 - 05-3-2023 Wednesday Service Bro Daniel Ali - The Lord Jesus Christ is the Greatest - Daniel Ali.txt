follow the business meeting when brother Steve gave their report so we would do it after service right after service we were close to service and have you to either state or go out and come back in and then we'll see would take about 30 minutes or so to be able to give the the business reports so those that will be able to say we will appreciate that and uh because of just some few changes

musicians shall we be seated for a moment God bless you all for coming tonight and are always good to see you we have met the conditions tonight where two or three I get it in my name there I am in their midst praise be to God even if it is one so what is here it wouldn't make any difference in the sight of God and I'm happy to see you all here and um Danny's birthday was yesterday actually Sunday morning he was here to give a testimony and uh it's just a miracle that he is alive yeah because I believe it was not once I believe it was more than once he passed out uh one time I think probably that I was the last one or the first one he was in a bus everybody alighted the bus driver went round and went round and went round and it was time for him to go and Park and there was one guy behind the bus who will never get down so he stopped that bus came to him tried to talk to him and he wasn't even there they had to call the police to come and get him and carry him to the hospital that was what drugs drugs was trying to finish him is just a miracle that he's here praise be to God I remember not quite it's not three years probably two and a half years now it was his birthday and uh we called at the time they were with the uh with their auntie and then we called to wish him a happy birthday and then I said Danny boy you're growing and then he left he said Daddy I'm growing well without wisdom so I laughed may his mother asked what is he saying I said your son says he's growing without wisdom so he said daddy do you remember in our morning devotion one time you said Jesus grew in stature and in wisdom I am growing in stature I'm not growing in wisdom praise be to God that is another thing we can talk about tonight about growth in every aspect one doesn't go without the other praise be to God it's just the grace of God and I remember you know they need my wife talking to Joshua he said it was because of you guys who went and bought house all that way so probably it's time to go back to Brooklyn Park and Joshua told his mother not even in Brooklyn Park but we can even go into the to the heart of Minneapolis our silver Christians praise be to God it's just wonderful and amazing What the Lord Has Done and I would just want to thank God you know for the lives of these children and every one of you all your prayers one thing I know our prayers will never go in vain praise be to God yes so tonight when I dropped my wife off to work I went back home I just went on my knees and prayed and I woke up and um just decided to you know a few things that came to me I wrote it down and I'm trusting and believing that God will just come in the Simplicity of his word and speak to every need there is in the house tonight praise be to God um shall we just stand and turn our Bibles to Isaiah 9. six Isaiah 9 6. okay so I read For unto us a child is born and to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace verse 7. of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this praise be to God should we turn shall we tend to Luke 3. Luke 3 16. John and that saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh the legend of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word shall we be seated praise the Lord I know when I read Isaiah probably you guys thought you know a lot of our Chris Christmas messages are taken from this and I know say brother Christmas is over even Easter is over what are we reading praise be to God we are going to go in a different direction this uh tonight uh trusting God to help us when brother Jordan prayed it was like you know just taking certain things out of what I am going to talk about tonight he said we don't want to come asking but to give you the glory and then just to praise him to bless him for what he has already done for us I don't know about you but as a matter of fact if the law does not do anything for me again is enough because he has already done more than enough there is nothing I can think of which the Lord has not done when I pray I ask I do but as a matter of fact if the Lord should not do anything if he does not do anything I also praise His holy name because he has done more than enough the most important thing about life human life which is your personal salvation he has given it to me it doesn't matter what comes and what goes that is beside the point whether I go barefooted whether I go without food whatever condition it is that I find myself in I will say praise God because the Lord our God is more than evil and it just ties in the prayer ties into what I'm going to talk about tonight praise be to God the title of my message is our Lord Jesus Christ is the greatest just to praise His holy name tonight there was a story about a Christian lady in Nigeria it happened in the Northwestern part of Nigeria that was somewhere last year now she just graduated from school and she passed her exams and she was happy that she passed her exams and she went on social media her colleagues were just posting things on social media and she also posted it that Jesus is the greatest and guess what the Muslims in the school who were her own classmates who had known her all those years said she blasphemed against their prophet and they were looking for her to kill and she ran and one of this the the the tutors hid her in her room and when they realized she was there they went in for her and they dragged her out and the stone her to death and then they set her body on fire and took pictures of it in fact you know when I was just thinking about it elsewhere people do not have the freedom we have in America here and we take it for granted that we can Worship the Lord Our God any time of day we can stand in the streets and shout and praise God the worst that would happen is that somebody will call the police and said there's somebody behind my window disturbing me and the police will come and ask you to go as he's going to arrest you that is the worst that can happen but there are places elsewhere in the world why people hide to save God why people do not have the same Freedom we have good and we have so much taking things for granted till we don't even know what we are missing because she said Jesus is the greatest they had to take away her life in a very gruesome manner and tonight I just want to talk about our lord Jesus is the greatest praise be to God in the message the Good Shepherd of the Sheep 1957. brother says I don't believe there is any greater thing that we could talk about tonight Dan would be the Lord Jesus he is the greatest person that we could talk about and I just love to talk and brag about him because he is ready of all things that anyone could say I have never found in any voice yet or in my thinking anyways that could ever express my gratitude to him for all that he has done for me and for others praise be to God that he has not found yet any voice and in his thinking he has not found anywhere to express his gratitude to the almighty God is that not a situation in which you find ourselves there are simply no ways now when you think of those words we use when we are praising God wonderful counselor Mighty God Prince of Peace Everlasting father when you think of those words we thank you we bless you we uplift you we glorify thee you are an awesome God you think of all those ways yes there is something in you that so tells you that you have not done Justice yet there are no words simply no worse to express our gratitude to his goodness and for the love he has for us and it just gives me the feeling that here on Earth it doesn't matter how much we praise him we can never hit that Mark until we get there praise be to God and I'm here tonight to brag about him it's not going to be a long service I'm just here to brag about him he is the greatest there is not like unto him he created the heavens and yet by his word there is power he is the almighty God he chose to become a man for our sake can you imagine if God had not come to Bear our sins and to carry them to the cross why would you and I be tonight where would we be he is the greatest he bore our sins he took our shame he died in our place he took the judgment he becomes sin who do you know sin that we should become the very righteousness of God he gave us all for you and me till brother brother says that he has no legs but our legs he has no hands but our hands praise be to God all that he is he gave it for us of all people we ought to be the most grateful praise be to God he came unto this Earth and he taught men in his ways we were born in sin and were shaped in iniquity we lived in sin and all about this were nothing but evil and sometimes for some of us our lives were so evil and so thinking that men of good morals were even ashamed to identify themselves with us but the almighty God the Lord of loss the king of kings the one and only Holy One there is and the one and only Hollywood that would ever be in his holiness in his Purity in his righteousness he chose to identify himself with our filth and with our evil condition praise be to God I'm just here to brag about the Lord tonight praise the Lord that there is not like unto him our lives were so out of place so useless so shattered that they had no use simply no use but in the hands of the almighty God our lives were useful Once Upon a Time in the Bible amen by name Simon Simon the Pharisee invited the Lord Jesus Christ to his house to come and have dinner with them and you already know that the Pharisees and the Lord Jesus did not have anything in common and a Pharisee was inviting him into his house and you already know that there was something under his lips and it was not anything good now the Lord Jesus Christ already knew what he was going to face there but that did not stop you from going and brother brothers says anywhere he is invited he goes and that he keeps his appointments hey can you imagine I'm just thinking about it that if Simon the Pharisee called him after he had gathered his colleagues just to make fun of him and he knew about it and he went anyhow how would you and I invite when he would not come that he knows that he is coming to receive praise that he knows he's been invited to come and receive honor and you think he would not come he is going to show up anyhow it reminds me of a story of her sister she knew and then one time she just prayed and said father I have heard a lot about you but I want to see you and that she went prepared food and then she said the table and then she was waiting then somebody came and knocked at the door and then she just jumped on her feet and went to the door lo and behold when she got to the door there was a man at the door that was dressed unkempt he was not in the right clothing he was not wearing the right hair he was not looking very good and then she stood open the door halfway yes can I help you and the man said I need some water to drink please and then the sister goes into the room and then she takes a cup it was not the most decent cup in the house but it was clean she went got water came and gave it to this man the man drunk said thank you God bless you and then she took the cup she waited and waited and waited till it was night and then she went to bed and prayed as a father I said the table I waited for you never showed up and then she went to bed and then she had a dream that she saw the Lord Jesus and then she was asking him why is it that I set the table and you didn't show up he said but I came I came and knocked at the door but you didn't receive me I asked for water to drink you didn't even give me the best of cups and they're in the dream she started whipping the Bible says that we should do good don't do good because you are expecting something in return don't show kindness because you are expecting something in return be kind and be good because that is what you are supposed to do as a child of God it doesn't matter who shows up he prayed the Lord came but in her mind she had a picture of how he should look like anyway you invite him he goes if you ever invite him be sure you show up and then he goes to someone the Pharisees house and then he sits down and it was the custom that you get to as your neighbor's place they have to wash your feet and Nod your head with oil give you a kiss it shows that you are welcomed but when he came wherever he sat that was it they were just sitting down and then looking at him how many they are fun probably talking evil about him and he was just sitting down sitting down and here comes a woman and then stands behind it just looking at the scene and she says no something is not right something is not right is this not a prophet oh this looks like him he is the one no I must do something about this and the Bible says she was a woman that was living off her body she was a prostitute and she said I must do something about this and then she ran to the house one day took her pants counted all the money she had she said you know what I need to do something about this she went out there running she got a place she bought she wanted to buy oil she said no this is the prophet of God she would know where this money is coming from this is not a good thing to do no I can't do this so say no but I have to do it well brother says that if a if if there is anything you want to do for God God will never stop you he will give you the chance to do it a lot of the times we come in our own way we become our own obstacles and we give reasons and excuses why we are not doing it praise the Lord and she bought this Alabaster oil and she run good day she went and stood who knows Emilio thoughts running in her mind he is the prophet of God he knows where I got this money to buy this thing from would he accept it something says don't go sometimes I'm going anyhow she just stood there and as she was standing behind him I mean she just got so broken she was the woman that was living in sin she what got so broken started whipping and then she just went before him probably looked in his eyes to see if he was going to be rejected and she saw nothing but smiles and a very welcoming attitude and then she came closer went on her knees started weeping started weeping the tears were just coming she was washing his feet with her tears washing his feet wiping it with her hair and when she had gone through took the alabaster ointment looked in his eyes whether there was any sense of rejection she saw nothing but love she held the oil probably trying to open it and she has was shaking would he accept this she knows where this thing is coming from just trying to open it until she open it just anointed his feet he was just looking at her anointed his feet and he assessed the Pharisees he said this man is he really a prophet if he was a prophet he would know who this woman is because this woman is known all over the city and here this woman is just sitting down anointing his feet and he's sitting there looking at her and then he called Simon Says Simon I have something to him to start ahead a house you didn't even welcome me now I want to ask you there were two debtors he gave him a very short story one old five pence the other old 50 pence and they didn't have the money to pay and the person from whom they borrowed this money forgive them yeah of the two people who do you think would be more grateful he said I suppose the one to whom most was forgiven he said yes you have said the right thing I came to your house you didn't welcome me you didn't wash my feet you didn't give me a kiss you didn't anoint my head you disregarded me by this lady here from that time she started washing my feet and anointing it she has never stopped and even though her sins are many has since I've forgiven her praise be to God and they said who is this man That Forgives sins her sins are forgiving her there is no sin that is too big that it cannot be forgiven you can be can be a waste of sinners there is enough Power in the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ to forgive you and to cleanse you has shattered life her life that were was shattered and broken Beyond repair has now been restored I don't know about you but I can look at my personal life and I can say without missing words that if it hadn't been for the sake of God oh my goodness my love would have been very very terrible I want the forests till I couldn't go any further it took the hand of God to bring me back it is the grace of God that has restored every one of us it is not our wisdom it is not our strength it is not a reality we are able to do it is what he has done and that is what we are depending on tonight if there is anybody we ought to be grateful of if there is anybody we ought to be proud of if there is anybody we ought to brag about it's nobody else by the Lord Jesus is our Lord and our personal savior praise be to God so the world the world is not a friend to the truth how can someone who is speaking the truth be giving such a raw Justice but that doesn't come to us by surprise John the Baptist was beheaded for speaking the truth the Lord Jesus was crucified for the truth ah through the years and All Through the Ages children of God we can talk about the Matthias of the Lord Jesus people that were crucified not because they committed in a crime but for believing the gospel praise be to God now all this brings us to is that it makes us get home sick for heaven when you look at the happiness that there is no more fear of God people don't fear God anymore that is why there is so much evil on the land you look at the chaos you look up moral degeneration you look at the words everything that is going on there is just one thing that comes into mind it makes you more homesick for heaven if you are not getting homesick for heaven then there is something wrong if you are making this your home then there is everything wrong if you are not getting homesick for heaven it speaks volumes as I said one time that I can never get home sick for Afghanistan because I don't belong there I don't even know where on the map it is praise the Lord but I can get home sick for Ghana because that is where I come from it doesn't matter how bad life was it doesn't matter whether we're living in a machine or in the bush there is just something about your childhood and your origin that you can't just forget and again there is just something about our true origin that you can never forget of so when you are getting home sick for heaven it shouldn't surprise you it tells you that you belong because you can never get home sick for a place you don't belong so for you getting home sick for heaven and thinking of going one of these days it tells you who you truly are and where you belong if you are not getting thirsty for the kingdom of God and you are not getting homesick for the kingdom of God and you are not feeling like it's time to go it's time to go and you are seeing this here as your place and you want to live a hundred years here there is a problem so all that is going on though it breaks our house what we hear of these stories a young lady that is coming up that has accepted Christ has a Lord and personal Savior and she's so happy she has passed her exam and she puts it out there and that becomes a death sentence it breaks your heart the kingdom of God does not know distance it doesn't matter whether it happened to the at the end of the world it doesn't mean anything in one way or the other we are all intricately intertwined connected together it breaks your heart It Makes You Weep it makes you ask questions we are serving a great and a wonderful God oh power in heaven and on Earth belong to him there is nothing he cannot do can you imagine was it last two weeks but what was preaching a preached about Palace judgment Hall a man that is sitting and listening to these people who could have called Legions of angels to come and fight for him who could have just spoken and all of them would disappear and yet with all the power and the authority he had to change the circumstances in a moment of time he sat down and they will speak and speak and speak and he'll look at them and would not even utter a word the police said but you not speak can't you speak are you not hearing all these allegations he would not speak and you know when a man has power an authority you can't get them to be silent you can't get them to be quiet you can't so that baffle them and that shows his greatness never a sign of weakness ensures his greatness and if ever you find yourself going through something and you are looking forward to the Lost intervention and you are not seeing anything happen it doesn't show that the Lord is weak he himself sat down in his own judgment and he didn't utter a word does it surprise you that you are going through something and then he sits down and he looks at here doesn't say anything sure praise the Lord it's play a good cause always remember that this is not our home we have a place to go to anything we live we'll continue to brag about him like unto him too he is a great and a wonderful God and we shall serve him whether rain or shine whether it is snowing whether it is raining whether they close the doors whichever way We Shall Serve God we shall magnify His holy name praise be to God praise God the Lord our God is great Hallelujah the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is dripping with blood is dripping with blood All Through the Ages like Elijah was crying before God and he said they have killed all the prophets and he's just left with me alone and God said no I have seven thousand that have not bowed their needs to bow praise be to God it doesn't matter how many they killed there will see the people here to magnify God praise be to God you can never map out a strategy for God the Bible says his words are passed finding out because it's a great and a wonderful God who will come map out the strategy for God the gospel is dripping with blood a lot have gone by the edge of the sword some were staked and bent alive and even in the midst of the fire there is an account that as a fire was Raising as I was set on fire and the fire was raging the sea lifted up their hands and still praise God in the midst of the flames wonderful praise be to God they were not shouting and crying no they're still lifted up their hands with the fire region and they praised God what a rebuke to the devil Samuel state and they made animals to feed on them alive some were thrown in the Lion's Den somewhere Sun asunder some were crucified upside down this gospel is dripping with blood it is not something you should take lightly never never take the word of God lightly this is life this is life praise be to God I have seen a video of a car that went up your flames and there was a Bible lying on the door on the dash on the dashboard the whole car was bent fire never touched the Bible this is life praise be to God Heaven and Earth shall pass away by the word of God would never pass away why judge of his word would never pass away feed on the word let the word take on flesh in you praise be to God wow my goodness when the word of God Lives in You you know that death is not your portion there is so much power in this world so much power that if you have the word of God in you and you even find yourself in hell is going to change it's going to have a different name it will not be hell anymore why because the son of God has entered there we saw that when Meshach Shadrach and Abednego were causing the ferry Phoenix when they refuse to Bow before the image up seven times when he looked at them he just saw three Renegades who would not bow to the King's Command that was the fourth person among them who had been with them all the way but he never saw them and they themselves they were just speaking of themselves three of them and they just said one to another we know the Lord Our God will deliver us and even if he doesn't we would not bow they didn't know that there was a fourth person [Music] in Nebuchadnezzar could even sit in his seat anymore he jumped up he said did we know cast three people inside there I can see the fourth one like the son of man who told him that sometimes God just allows situations to come so you can see him praise be to God to let you know now we have not believed cunningly devised Fables that we have believed the truth the life of God God just allows it so you can see his glory he would have stopped it but he just permitted it praise be to God and the Lord our God is with us it is a promise he has made and God keeps his word that I will be with you always are we and God has not delivered us from our past from our sins and our trespasses only to abandon us no praise be to God he is bringing us onto an expected end for his name's sake for his name's sake praise be to God how many remember that sermon brother one preached for his name's sake there is nothing in our past there is nothing in the present time there is nothing in the future that can undo what God has already done sometimes we means it cannot overturn but I'm not going to say that what God has done is casting Stone instant casting stone is cast in the blood in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that what God himself has done God can never undo it anymore it is settled forever it is settled it is settled praise be to God it is settled we have a place to go the good ways God has started in you God is going to follow through God is going to follow through every one of them a lot of the times we are our own obstacles a lot of the times we are in our own way and then we keep complaining we are not seeing God excuse me the good words God has started he will surely bring you to completion so don't worry don't worry how you are going to exit this life don't go to bed thinking about it God has already figured it out God has already figured it out you could be like someone Peter who was crucified upside down you could be like Stephen who was thrown to death oh this lady we just talked about Deborah you could also be like John in a pot of boiling oil God has already figured it out don't spend your precious time thinking about how you're going to exit this life use that time to get closer to God use that time to serve God use that time to seek a face of God and to wait on God God has already figured that out is your life with Christ it is not your Allegiance to the church or to the people of God it's your personal relationship with Christ that is what you should be concerned about that is why you should examine by day and by night your personal work with God is that the economy the economy can never get better U.S is owing um I think is 31 trillion is it 31 trillion dollars something in that range and then they had to they had to extend the the what did they call it again the hunter extend it again as the governor is going to go bankrupt and I think it's gone up to 33 Bill 33 trillion now so it is not getting any better the economy don't waste what I'm thinking about the economy it's not going to get any better don't waste your time thinking about the stock market it just go up and buy and just come down like that don't waste your time what you should spend your time on is your personal relationship Christ my brother said in the message best friends that if we should have a George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in every County of the United States they couldn't make anything better nothing is going to change it wouldn't change anything and these are men that this country so much respects because of what they stood for me they couldn't change anything what you should be doing as the time is getting to its end who is on his way out there is no doubt whether we believe it or not time is on its way out what you should be doing is just examining every single step you take the things you do that change your treasure where your heart is is your heart here is your heart on the things of God what are you thinking about what is life for you what matters to you actually in this life is it Christ is it your personal plans and ambitions is it a goal that you have set for yourself the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and all his righteousness and all other things shall be added unto you but a lot of the times we reverse it instead of seeking Christ first one is seek all other things before we come seeking God it doesn't work that way put God first put God first in your daily work with him put God first in your academic work put God first at work put God first in church put God first let God Be Your absolute praise be to God it's a minute to nine um I will just keep a few things here there is a word I see my fight unto a man the Bible says by the end thereof is death I just want to encourage ourselves tonight Lord never lean on your own understanding learn to lean on God there is a way that God has chosen for you and where God has ordained for you to walk in learn to walk in God's way in the way that God has ordained the path that God has chosen for you walk in that path there are a lot of side attractions straight is the gate and narrow is the way that lead us to life and feel Debbie that find it but where is the gates and brothers away that leads to destruction and many diabetes that go in there right our steps are ordered of the Lord the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord you don't work where Christ wouldn't work you don't carry yourself to a place where Christ wouldn't go you don't eat something or drink something or smoke something that Christ within it drink or smoke no that you are a child of God fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of God and you are here to advertise Christ because the Bible says we are written Epistles we are here to advertise Christ what do these people who advertise this what do they do they just put some nice picture of a meal you know that when you see the picture you get hungry and sometimes you even buy it especially me praise the Lord I don't know the American food very well so at work we have a cafeteria I would go and I don't know what to order so I'll be standing and then watching when somebody orders something I like it I'll just come by I say okay what you just give this person I want the same thing and sometimes they'll even embarrass you they have just said the person and you are telling them I want the same thing he gave that man they say um do you want anything different different things is that American cheese or something cheese uh have what percent how many how many percent of milk oh did they just embarrass you so but after covered a lot of things changed after covet that now that is there is there is there is an app you just sit in the office and then you can see the picture and then you just send it in when the food is ready you go and pick your tin up praise the Lord and sometimes when you go for the food it doesn't taste like you saw it so adverts that is what advertising is meant to do they just advertise it nice picture very attractive and then you see that you are hungry for it that is how we ought to be to be we ought to advertise Christ every moment of Our Lives that people who see our lesson get thirsty for Christ that the Bible not say that we are the salt of the earth if you lose your saltiness what is your value anymore leave Christ and let people see Christ and let them get so hungry for Christ that they would come they want to come and see praise be to God come and see come and see and then when they come God takes over praise be to God I want to run I just want to speed um I just want to oh my goodness there is something here um is there nobody working tonight so is good that you get the Holy Ghost it's a must we can't we can't change that for anything the Holy Ghost is the earnest of our Resurrection is The Surety you have that there is a place for you on the other side everybody says even without the Holy Ghost baptism you have not yet you are not even a Christian to begin with if you do not have the Holy Ghost pray for the Holy Ghost for the Bible says the book of jawah that he will pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh it's a promise and you can hold God to his promise any day any moment under any condition because God will do exactly what he has said he will do Nothing Stops him don't settle for anything do not settle for church membership do not settle for anything less make sure that your life is locked in with Christ get the Holy Ghost and it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the Holy Ghost sometimes you pray or you pray person no I'm not getting the Holy Ghost God is more willing as Barbara said to give you the holy ghost that you you are willing to get the Holy Ghost the Bible says ask and you will receive seek and you shall find knock and the dust shall be opened unto you foreign unto them and the Bible goes on to say that ye being evil if you know how to give good gifts unto your children to the extent that when your church you ask of fish you will not give them a snake if you are so evil you know how to do good how would your heavenly father give you the Holy Ghost to them that ask for the Holy Ghost how would your health praise be to God what a wonderful father he is praise be to God you think God will promise you the Holy Ghost and not give it to you why would Jesus tell the disciples to tarry in Jerusalem not to depart until they were endured with power and authority and then turn around and deny you the Holy Ghost baptism a must it's not taking on identity as a church member it's a good thing to come to church it's a good thing to read your Bible it's a good thing to pray it's a good thing to do good but if that is always settle for and you are not willing to go further then there is a problem is just like a plane a plane that is 36 000 feet because that is the rain they fly 36 38 39 in between there so I play that is 36 000 feet in the air and then they look down and they see the houses and all those High scrapers they see them small small small on the ground sometimes I don't even see anything all they see is Skies the clouds now just imagine yourself religion is a very dangerous thing very very dangerous I'm going to say this and how close that I will not I'll just yeah I'll just put I'll just end with this now never compare yourself to one another because the Bible says that if you do that you are not wise and a lot of the times we don't even do that even though there is no wisdom in it but we even go below to compare ourselves to the people in the world I don't dress the way they dress I don't speak the way they speak I have my pants my belt is on my waist is falling I don't even know how they manage to do that one time I put on my pants in the living room I was just going to get my belt in the other room and I was just before I got to this I was tired already and you see them you see them both young and old and the pace is falling and they are just there all day they walk one two three and they'll pull it up one two three they'll pull it up and you wonder what is going on in their heads oh I don't behave I don't talk the way they talk these are people that have not come to the knowledge of the world these are people that have not have that privilege to hear the word and you are comparing yourself to them you have demoted yourself it's a beautiful sight and that is what happens when you see yourself spiritually speaking now 36 000 feet in the skies and then you look down and you are seeing those unbelievers so oh I'm not like them oh these are just a bunch of useless people oh um I am way up there one thing is certain one thing is certain to be in the air 36 000 feet it shows that you are not where you used to be but it equally means that you have not arrived yet because the Bible says never let complications set in it doesn't matter how high you go there is still room to go it doesn't matter how much of God you have in your life there is some more of God to experience never be complacent with anything 36 000 feet in the skies it can be a cup half full it can also be a cup half empty when you get there and you think I have arrived it becomes a cup half empty it's just a matter of time that you are going to throw in the towel and then tell the world that you don't believe anymore but it becomes a cup half full that when you find yourself there you said I am still going up there is no complacency in this business keep going keep pushing on keep pressing on the Bible says why do people call heresy that's the way we serve the god of our fathers it doesn't have to make sense to the world keep pushing up keep pushing on I promise to end on this and I'm going to keep my promise somehow press be to God oh yes I think I think okay I will do my best shall we open to Second Corinthians second Corinthians four second Corinthians the musicians can come over to show that I mean it praise the Lord yes all right second Corinthians 4. chapter eight uh chapter 4 verse 8. 4 8. we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroy it praise be to God always bearing about in the body the diet of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body 11 for we which are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh certain death record in us but life in you we having the same Spirit by faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak verse 14 knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you praise be to God oh yes this is why I want to bring the curtain down it doesn't matter what troubles we go through it doesn't matter the persecutions it doesn't matter what it is we are not a blessed we are not cast down one good thing when your soul is saved when you have the body goes baptism when you are sealed in praise be to God it doesn't matter what happens it doesn't matter what happens it doesn't matter what happens the game is ended praise be to God shall we give the Lord a clap of fruit tonight [Applause] it's risk I just want to cooperate I want to take over [Music] God bless you
