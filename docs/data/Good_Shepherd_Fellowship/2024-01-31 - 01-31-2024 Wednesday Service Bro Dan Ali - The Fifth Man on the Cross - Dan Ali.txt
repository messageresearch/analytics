Lord and savior amen praise the Lord shall we be seated for just a moment God bless you all Saints I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord yes it's not an easy thing go to work I know some of you are coming from work and you have to come here and some are going to work and you have to come here before you go it's not an easy task but you know when you have a little bit of God in you it is not a burden it's just a love affair it is the love of God in you that is driving you sometimes you are so tired you want to rest you are so tired on your way home you tell yourself today I have a good reason not to go to church but then as soon as it's time you don't know what even gets you ready it is the grace of God and uh I just want to uh thank the almighty God for his grace yes uh brother Emmanuel I think today is probably the the last day we'll be seeing you for this time you are living on on Friday yes um the Lord bless you it was it was very nice you know having this time fellowship with you and your wife I know you are going should be here for a little while um and may the Lord carry you safely yes we we'll definitely miss you praise the Lord praise God yes a child of God just know one thing for sure that you will never get lost I don't know either here or somebody online but you will never get lost I remember in the village where I was growing up it was a place people used to hunt a lot and it didn't happen very often but once in a while a hunter goes hunting and then he doesn't come back by there I mean they hunting the Night by day break they expect him to be home and he's not there and they summon men to go to the bush to go and find him they don't know where he went and there are no cell phones and even if there were cell phones in those days why in the bush would you get coverage and then the men will go whether dead or alive they will bring that person back home and I started thinking about it how many times in our personal lives have we taken the wrong turn that you get to a junction in your life and then you make a wrong turn it is not an indication that you are lost there is hope for the living some Hunters go they were born and bred in the same Village and they know the bushes very well and this happened to the prophet of God anyway and then they get lost in the bush and then they will go round and round and round and before they away they are back to the same place and then they keep trying and keep trying and keep trying and then they make the last turn and then they keep going and then they realize that all of a sudden oh that is the city on top of the hill there and even though they have not arrived but seeing the city a far off gives them the hope that I am already home praise be to God it doesn't matter how many tweets and how many tense you have made in this life it doesn't matter how many wrong choices you have made it doesn't matter how many wrong tense you have made but we have taken the final turn praise be to God we are on the home run amen and we are seeing the city on the hill by eyes of faith and even though we have not reached yet the Bible says that we are already seated in Heavenly places through Christ Jesus we are there already praise God a child of God would never get lost praise God what are we talking about tonight either last week or somewhere last week two weeks I was reading actually it was in The Book of Daniel and when I don't know I either chapter I mean one of the chapters excuse me when I finished reading and I was just going on my knees something just jumped to me now a lot of things jump to me and then they go but this one that came to me has come to stay praise be to God even in my death bed before I take my last breath that picture is going to be before me and that is what we are going to talk about tonight praise the Lord can we please stand and then take our Bibles open to Ephesians 2 Ephesians 2 we are reading from 4 to 8 Ephesians 2:4 to8 but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where with he loved us I see people are flipping their pages is everybody there praise God I take it again but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might sheld the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of your works it is the gift of God may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word praise God shall we be seated what jumped to me that day is the fif man on the cross what I was reading had nothing to do with this and just from nowhere it just hit me the fifth man on the cross and that went deep into my soul praise be to God and I am feeding on it every inch along the way praise the Lord it wasn't something I just read or something I thought of it just came the fifth man on the cross now after the fall things were never the same again everything changed concerning God's order of procreation Adam was supposed to speak the children into existence but because of the Fall instead of God's perfect will we now had the permissive will of God regarding procreation that it had to take a man and a woman to bring forth children but that was not God's perfect will that was his permissive will and that was the order now when you look at this that every man now let me set the record straight the fifth man on the cross I am not leaving the sisters out because I thought of it I said instead of a fif man on the cross why don't I say the fifth person on the cross so the sisters will feel included praise the Lord but then the way it came to me I said I want to just put it out that way and a voice said maybe you are leaving the sisters out we are not leaving the sisters out the Bible says that he came to his own and his own received him not but to as many as received him he gave them the power to be called what sons of God and are there Daughters of God yes he gave them power to be called sons of God he was not leaving out the daughters so we are not leaving out the daughters we are not leaving out the sisters we are all a part of this journey and now when we talk of the bride of Christ a bride has to be a lady right and here I am amen I a bride of Christ so I hope you are getting the picture very good so don't say because it's titled the fifth man on the cross the sisters are left out nobody is left out praise the Lord so every man and for that matter every woman that was born was born into sinful flesh we sin by representation because Adam sin Adam and Eve fell so we were born straight into the devil's pawn shop and for those of you who are conversent with the porn shop when you carry anything to the pawn shop whether a jewelry whether whatever it is and you carry it there the operator will take it and then they'll give you some money in return that thing you carry there doesn't belong to them but then because they have given you money towards it there is no way you can walk in there and claim it you would have to pay the ransome to be able to take back that which belongs to you so every man that was born was born straight into the devil's pawn shop and there we were sitting who was going to pay the ransom no wonder John on the island of Patmos when he saw that there was no one wory to take the book and to open the seals thereof he started crying but there was hope when he saw right in the midst of the Throne of God that Bloody lamp came there was hope and all Humanity was waiting for that moment praise be to God all Humanity was waiting for that even though his coming was long prophesied and the people were expecting his coming yet when he came they didn't realize it they lost it because in their mind they had a picture of how he was going to come and then he came in a way they never expected and they called him names they stood against him but there was no obstacle that could stop him from doing the will of the father he came for a purpose and there was nothing that was going to stop him with all the opposition all the obstacles all the name calling nothing was going to stop him if you are a child of God at work or in your neighborhood you may be surrounded by people that will strongly oppose you in everything but you know what you need them you probably need them more than they need you that no they give me headache at work they give me too much work they call me names they are always on my case yes and you need them God placed you there for a cause they are there to bring something in you out and the sooner you embrace it the better it will be for you you should be happy it's not an easy thing on several occasions my previous manager will used to sit down and have a very long conversation and sometimes I would think after that he wouldn't talk to me again but he was very nice praise the Lord but you need them God will use them to cut you to shape praise the Lord there was no obstacle that could stop him he had to fulfill the purpose of his coming praise the Lord now when his time on Earth had was coming to an end he was examined the purpose of which he came now the time was coming praise the Lord he was being examined the Bible says at the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established pilate said this man you guys are accusing I found had no fault in him he was blameless even Judas is scariot after betraying him for 30 pieces of silver he said I have I have I have I betrayed an innocent blood his own confession he was without guilt he didn't commit any crime there was nothing they could impute on him they couldn't find any cause against him and yet he was found guilty it doesn't happen in the court of law in the court of law you are presumed innocent until proven guilty but in his case he was found guilty before the case even started we are talking about the fifth man on the cross praise the Lord in the message earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints 1953 the prayer of God says and look some people only see three crosses at goata there were four there was a thief on one side a thief on the other side Jesus in the middle and cursed is he that HTH on a tree Jesus was made a cast for us hanging on a tree and Judas hang himself on a Sy tree just as much cross as the rest of them there were four crosses the two thieves and the Lord Jesus and there was a fourth cross for Judas Iscariot praise the Lord now on the fourth cross Judas betrayed the Lord and he hanged himself as a result the two thevs committed crimes and they were found guilty to die but here was an innocent man who didn't have to be there he didn't have to be there because he did not commit any crime he did not do anything evil he did not cver anybody's property but here he was there and he was there for a friend the just representing the unjust the righteous for the unrighteous he was there not for himself he was there for somebody pilot said he didn't find any fault in him and yet he was found guilty now in the message Christ is revealed in his own word the prophet of God said now the same thing is this if you are a son of God and if I am a Son of God or a daughter of God we were in God at the beginning and when Jesus came the fullness of the word then we were in him gem form when he was crucified we were crucified in his body when he rose from the dead we rose with him 1965 the message things that are to be the pray of God says and I am a believer and now we are assembled we've just been taught that we were in Christ when he walked on Earth for we are part of his word he suffered we suffered with him we bled with him we died with him we was buried with him we are risen with him and we are setting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise the Lord so when he hang on the cross he carried someone with him praise the Lord there were four crosses there were four crosses the Lord Jesus the two te Judas but there were five people here is where I want you to personalize it personalize it praise be to God personalize it I don't want to get ahead of myself praise the Lord so as he hang on the cross he carried someone with him there was a fifth man hanging with him on the cross the fif man couldn't die on his own cross because he was meant to live and not die praise the Lord dying on his own cross would mean a oneway ticket to Hell the fif man was going to have his moment to carry his cross the Lord Jesus said If any man comes after me let him take up his cross let him deny himself daily take up his cross and follow me so there was he was going to have his moment but on the spare of that moment on that great occasion he was being hidden praise be to God because there was a friend that had come on the scene to take on that judgment a judgment he couldn't take there was a friend that had come on the scene to pay that debt a debt he didn't owe that friend had come is just like committing a crime and then going to the court and then you take a lawyer you'll be sitting there you don't have to speak when they call your name is the lawyer that shows up he does all the Talking praise the Lord the fifth man praise be to God the fifth man was going to have his woman to carry his own cross If any man comes after me let him deny himself himself take up his cross daily and follow me so his moment was coming but not on that great occasion you and I have a cross to carry and this cross we are carrying is an appreciation to that cross he cared praise be to God it only makes us partakers of his suffering of his Agony his persecution his rejection his dejection praise be to God and remember that salvation is not of works for by grace are we is saved through faith so we are riding on this grace to glory is what the grace of God has done for us that is what we are depending on that is what has brought us this far and that is what is going to see us through there is no doubt whatever now we are talking about the fifth man on the cross and I'm saying just personalize it I am the fifth man on the cross you are the fifth the fifth sister on the cross you are the fifth brother on the cross I am the fifth man on the cross now the prophet of God said five is the number of Grace I mean yes five is the number of Grace there are seven dimensions The Fifth Dimension is where every sinner goes when they die praise the Lord all right good we are good so we don't even need bares anymore praise the Lord so the The Fifth Dimension is where unrepented souls go when they die now and we are talking about the fifth man on the cross now what would ever make this possible the only thing that could take the fifth man from The Fifth Dimension was nothing but the grace of God praise the Lord for the wages of sin is death and all we were good for was to just come live die and go to hell but it took the grace of God and it will take nothing but the grace of God to overend the table Christ was crucified once and we were crucified with him we were in him when he was crucified on the cross and this is where we ought to be very very very careful because you were in him when he was crucified if you should do anything contrary to his word you are crucifying him again you are crucifying him AR fresh why because you were in that body when he hang on the cross he was crucified once not twice once now look at Moses when God told Moses to speak to the rock that The Rock oh I forgotten myself that The Rock will bring forth water Moses out of anger struck the rock not once but twice and called the children of God Rebels and God was not happy with Moses to the extent that God told Moses your eyes will see the promised land but your foot would not set there the prophet of God said that what Moses did he broke the scriptures he broke the that perfect picture God had because the rock that followed them in the wilderness was Christ and he was supposed to be smitten once and not twice and Moses smot it twice and the prophet of God said by that act he broke that picture that they broke scriptures God was not happy with him and to tell you what God would do smiting him the second time I know we can look at our lives and we can count some of us can count some of us have lost count of how many times we have crucified him over and over when does it stop when does it come to an end today if you hear his voice Harding not your heart it must stop I used to tell Dan and Joshua I said look if you are holding drug and you say I am going to take this for the last time I say it shows you going to take it again I said but if you say for the first time I am not going to take this I say it shows you are on your way to Deliverance whatever you are doing that you know in your heart is not right with the word of God that you know that by that act you are crucifying him again or the second time or you are crucifying him aresh it's time to call it a quit and seek the face of God with all endlessness and ask for forgiveness he was crucified on the cross we were in him we died with him we were buried with him and we rose with him and we are seated in Heavenly places through Christ Jesus praise the lord we are not defeated we are on the winning side I don't care whatever happens praise be to God I know when he was on the cross I was with him praise be to God my life would never be the same again oh praise God I have probably said it a thousand times and I'm going to add it again a,1 times that there are not enough demons in hell because my soul has found his Ty poost praise the Lord there are no not enough demons in hell that can change the picture praise be to God there are not enough demons praise God I don't care if they ever cut my head and they carry somewhere and they take the leg somewhere it doesn't make any difference praise the lord we are alive and we are alive forever more amen sometimes we look at us we oh my goodness okay sometimes we look at us we fail to see what God is doing all we just see is our weaknesses all we just see is the struggles we are going through all we just see is the headaches the heartaches we forget that there is a God we are saing and when God looks down and he sees that you are in trouble he sends help he doesn't sit on the fence and just look at you no there is always help the angels of the Lord encom FR about them that fear Him and what is the fear of God having the respect for the word esteeming the word of God living by the word the angels of the Lord en cabine About You by day and by night and when you are in trouble they are there to your rescue the fifth man on the cross praise the Lord as I was talking about Moses in the wilderness we are in our Wilderness Journey now and it is it is a very difficult moment for anybody um it either brings the best out of you or it brings the worst out of you for Moses it just got to that point he couldn't handle it anymore out of anger he saw the promised land he didn't set his foot there and I was wondering I was wondering as we are going through our Wilderness Journey spiritually speaking by the time we come to the end of our road in this life where would we be standing this is where you have to make sure that you are earnestly contending for the faith earnestly if there was any time to fight it is now if there was any time to seek the face of God the most it is now if there was any time to glue yourself to the word it is now for heaven and Earth shall pass away but the word of God will never pass away everything is caving in this world has come to an end we have studed time and time and again praise the Lord but remember that we are on the winning side why because before the foundation of this world we were in him from the beginning brother one has been preaching a series from the beginning we were in him from the beginning before the foundation we were in him and he would never lose anyone he would never lose anyone praise the Lord so it was in the wilderness that a lot of the people filled him a lot of the people that saw the power of God that tested the power of God that saw God In Action they saw the pillar of fire they saw that cloud the pillar of cloud it was in the wilderness in spite of everything God was doing the let God down either last week or last two weeks when brother one was preaching he said that the end ending well this race is the ending well I'm I'm trying to put the pieces to ending well is very important um it's about ending well I don't know how many people remember that but that phrase caught me when I was sitting in the fo ending well you will hear some people say I used to I used to how about now what happened what went wrong he is the same yesterday today and forever he is an everpresent tense God not the god of yesterday he's also the god of today so how about today amen an everpresent tense God ending well on a good note is very very very imperative it doesn't matter how good the start is you can be leading the race and then you get before the tape maybe from here to this speaker and then you get there and you decide to St because you were leading and everybody comes and then they pass you just became late praise the Lord ending World in this race is of great importance it doesn't matter how many years you have been in the service of the Lord it doesn't matter how close you have come or how well you you think you know stay with the word stay with the word do not let the word ever depart from you that is our anchor that is our strength that is the beauty of Christianity that a man can take the word of God and live by it that man can see God in your life that is the beauty of Christianity but if you profess Christianity and man cannot see God in you where lies your confession the fif man on the cross death Stang him only once you know when a bee stinks you it can't stink anymore so when that be of death Stang him it was just once and it lost its stting if you are in Christ you were condemned with him died with him buried with him and you Rose up with him praise the Lord the fifth men singular it has to take your personal faith for by grace are ye saved through faith for without faith it is impossible for any man to please God it has to take your personal faith to see yourself there and nothing can take you out nothing nothing can take you out it takes your person not the faith of another person not your faith not the faith of your father not the faith of your mother it has to take your personal faith for by grace are we saved Grace overed the Judgment Grace made the impossibility possible he took the sting out of death and broke the power of death praise the Lord when the Beast think when that bee of death than him there was no more Venom left in it for the fif man praise the Lord there was no more Venom left in it for the fif man he took it all death has no power over you the grave has no power over youall Satan has no power over you oh death where is th sting oh grave what is thy victory we should be we should be we should be we should be glad that of all people he chose us you couldn't Choose Yourself I want to think that if we were even given the chance to choose and we saw what we were going to go through we will say no I don't want to do it so it is not your choice he chose you praise be to God and everything you need to overcome he has deposited in you he has equipped you for the journey stop complaining get down to business Victory Is Ours when he overcame he didn't carry the victory with him he left the victory with the church and we are a part of the church we are victorious praise be to God he took the sting out of death he took the venom out we have moved from Death To Life and we are already seated in Heavenly places through Christ Jesus when the devil brings you to a place and tells you that God doesn't know you tell him that before there was a world you are in him when he brings you to a place to tell you you are not a Christian tell him when he hang on the cross I was there that I was the fifth person on the cross when the devil tells you oh this is what you have done this is what you have done this is what you have done tell him all that was nailed on the cross and that you are a new creation in God praise be to God praise the Lord oh we just give God a glory the fifth man on the cross the fifth brother on the cross the fifth sister on the cross I want us to leave here tonight with one settled in our house that the person I used to be was nailed on the cross that I am no longer in the devil's pawn shop that the ransom has been paid that I am free to sin no more if you are living in sin it's a choice you have made it is not because you can't break away from it there is power in the blood to set you free to break every C there is in your life there is enough Power in the Blood to change your life forever praise the Lord amen the drunker I used used to be I am no more the places I used to go I go there no more the things I used to do I do them no more the thoughts I used to wrestle with I wrestle with
