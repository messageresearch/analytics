[34:07] what true fatherhood is in order to do
[34:10] to us is that we can either appreciate
[34:14] the way our fathers treated us or we can
[34:20] see that you know the who have done

[39:23] turn to the book of 2nd Timothy 2nd
[39:28] Timothy I want to pick up chapter 3 2nd
[39:35] Timothy chapter 3
[39:36] I want to speak this morning on the
[39:40] inspiration of the Almighty give it
[39:44] wisdom the inspiration of the Almighty
[39:49] giveth wisdom and for further for the
[39:53] subtitle if I would call it that grid
[39:55] men I'm not always wise and the way I
[39:58] want to look at that verse this morning
[40:01] is net is net in a negative sense I want
[40:07] to look at that verse this morning from
[40:11] from the background that grid men were
[40:13] not born with silver spoon grid men were
[40:18] not born with easy life
[40:21] so grid men are not always wise there
[40:26] was a period of time that they were
[40:29] exposed to greatness something happened
[40:31] in their life they put their name on the
[40:35] pages of history
[40:39] so grid men are now always wise it's not
[40:43] in a negative sense that because they
[40:44] are great so they are now wise no that's
[40:47] not what I'm going to talk about this
[40:48] morning I'm going to talk about the
[40:51] inspiration of the Almighty
[40:54] give you wisdom so there there is a time
[40:57] word men like Abraham Lincoln George
[41:01] Washington I'm just looking at the news
[41:03] yesterday and I was just I was just
[41:06] feeling so sorry my heart and and
[41:09] realizing what a place we have come to
[41:12] as a generation you know an age that we
[41:16] have come to them and people mind are so
[41:19] crossed they don't even know what they
[41:21] are doing you know with all of the
[41:23] taking down the monuments and everything
[41:26] you know that are happening only for the
[41:28] fact that they can they can contribute
[41:30] their - oh yeah he was a slave owner but
[41:34] they are now looking at what those men's
[41:38] - for that was what the new that was
[41:41] what the new I don't want to go into
[41:44] there this morning but let's just stay
[41:47] in our inspiration great man
[41:50] and now always watch they were not born
[41:52] with service form something happened
[41:54] they came in contact with the
[41:56] inspiration of the almighty that changed
[41:59] their lives David became and even till
[42:07] tomorrow he's the favorite King in
[42:09] Israel when you talk about King the
[42:13] favorite King in Israel the man after
[42:18] God on her that God even promised I will
[42:21] not take the truth even if your sons
[42:24] filming because of David's sake I will
[42:28] still keep a light in Israel he was now
[42:34] born with wisdom he was not born with
[42:39] silver spoon something happened and I
[42:46] can start from right there something
[42:47] happy in the life of David and what
[42:50] happened in the life of David like you
[42:52] might look at it as as a sign as a
[42:56] rejection he saw he's the the smallest
[42:59] of the family and yet his father gave
[43:02] him this responsibility out there to go
[43:04] and take care of the sheep he's never
[43:06] home but that would be the thing that
[43:10] would create greatness in the life of
[43:11] David when he never took offense in what
[43:17] his father give him he never looked at
[43:19] it as as if the father is treating his
[43:22] brothers better than him he never took
[43:24] it as a sense of rejection he never took
[43:26] it as sad as he was cast out or all the
[43:34] other boys were home playing video games
[43:36] he was in the field taking care of his
[43:38] father's sheep but that would be the
[43:43] thing that would build a character of
[43:46] greatness in him the inspiration of the
[43:51] Almighty that's why we want to talk
[43:55] about this morning second Timothy
[43:57] chapter 3
[44:07] second Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 and 17
[44:12] the Bible says all scriptures I given by
[44:17] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[44:22] doctrine for reproof for correction for
[44:26] instruction in righteousness that the
[44:30] man of God now this word men of God it
[44:35] was first used in the Bible
[44:37] speaking of the prophets but I want to
[44:39] say this morning the man of God the
[44:42] prophets the man of God the preacher the
[44:45] man of God the Father the man of God the
[44:48] Sun in the house the man of God uh God's
[44:55] children praise the Lord amen
[45:00] thank you for your prayers I mean this
[45:03] week I just got so so tired
[45:09] I was just so exhausted Thursday Friday
[45:12] I don't know some kind of a sweep of
[45:14] tiredness just came I mean but we want
[45:17] to thank the Lord for for keeping us up
[45:21] I mean that the man of God may be
[45:26] perfect that word perfect speaks about
[45:29] being mentored a man of God being
[45:33] trained and and and he knows what to do
[45:37] with the Word of God he knows how to
[45:40] apply the word of God to his home he's
[45:43] learned how to apply the Word of God to
[45:45] his life he learned how to deal with
[45:49] situation in the work area with his
[45:52] friends with his family he knows he
[45:56] learned how to deal with situation by
[45:59] the Word of God that a man of God may be
[46:02] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[46:07] good works all Scripture is given by
[46:14] inspiration of God it's given by the
[46:18] breath of God Jesus said man shall not
[46:21] live by bread alone ball by every word
[46:25] of God shall a man leave every word of
[46:32] God is the breath of God if you if you
[46:38] take the word of God reading the word of
[46:41] God and not just really need to have a
[46:44] smart understanding and just really need
[46:47] to assure yourself to your logical is
[46:50] smart but you are reading the Word of
[46:52] God and expecting that that word of God
[46:54] will breathe into your life it will be
[47:00] able to help you to apply your heart to
[47:03] wisdom every scripture is given by
[47:07] inspiration that's the reason why there
[47:16] is no contradiction in God's Word
[47:18] because every scripture is given by
[47:22] inspiration just one verse one line in
[47:28] the Bible is enough to produce God in
[47:33] our lives when God breath into man for
[47:43] him to become a living soul I don't
[47:45] believe that going I just believe that
[47:54] he breathed and man starts to live
[48:02] although I gotta breathe more hotter
[48:09] every scripture is given by inspiration
[48:15] when God speak a word when he made a
[48:20] promise
[48:21] there are antenna thoughts that are
[48:25] behind that promise there are antenna
[48:29] thoughts that you can benefit from now
[48:32] and you will enjoy in eternity that is
[48:35] behind that promise that's the reason
[48:41] why we cannot take one verse in the
[48:43] Bible or one coat and make a doctrine
[48:45] out of it will be we will be limiting
[48:50] their intent of God that's the reason
[48:57] why you don't have to know every chapter
[49:00] every scripture in the Bible to be able
[49:03] to live a life of God if you can just
[49:07] appreciate one verse in the Bible that
[49:10] speaks are so loud to you that words is
[49:16] enough to give you a rapture if faith is
[49:19] enough to change your body every
[49:27] scripture is given by inspiration every
[49:32] scripture God attached his life to eight
[49:35] is the breath of God is the Zoe of God
[49:40] he attached his life to every word
[49:53] it's profitable for doctrine for reproof
[49:56] for correction for instruction in
[49:59] righteousness that the man of God that a
[50:05] man of God this does not only limit to
[50:08] the preachers that a man of God that
[50:10] every child of God yeah every child of
[50:14] God God made man in His image male and
[50:17] female it does not take the woman out of
[50:21] this she's also part of it that the man
[50:23] of God is talking about that man made in
[50:26] the image of God that the man of God may
[50:30] be perfect that that son of God and that
[50:36] daughter of God can come to a place of
[50:39] maturity come to a place of
[50:41] understanding that we have not gone a
[50:48] cut we are not following
[50:51] Conan's devised feeble but the one that
[50:58] we are dealing with is the antenna one
[51:01] you know the one the very same one that
[51:03] created the heaven and earth praise the
[51:09] Lord are we together
[51:24] Saint John chapter 1
[51:42] listen today's in the beginning was the
[51:45] word and the Word was with God that's
[51:47] from verse one and the world was God and
[51:50] the same was in the beginning with God
[51:53] all things were made by him and without
[51:56] him was not anything made that was me
[52:01] and in him was life in him was life and
[52:07] the life was the light of man
[52:15] now this go back to the beginning the
[52:18] same God that made all things by his
[52:22] word and without him the very thing that
[52:26] he he used to create the universe it's
[52:30] the very thing that he used to make you
[52:34] and myself that life was the light of
[52:42] man
[52:47] praise the Lord
[52:56] when David said the Lord is my light and
[53:00] my salvation
[53:03] David was looking at the beginning you
[53:09] seemed God I said let there be light the
[53:14] Lord is my light and my salvation whom
[53:20] shall I fear
[53:23] he's a very strength of my life of whom
[53:25] shall I be afraid the one that we are
[53:30] dealing with is a very same one that
[53:34] created a universe so we want to speak
[53:40] this morning
[53:41] great man and now always wise the
[53:45] inspiration of the Almighty that's what
[53:48] give wisdom for a man whether it was I
[53:53] bought instant whether it was a Benjamin
[53:57] Franklin all of this man whose name I
[54:00] written across history this man to have
[54:05] invented things their names are written
[54:08] across history
[54:10] somewhere along the line distract the
[54:13] inspiration of the Almighty not even
[54:16] Laurie somewhere along the line the
[54:23] struck the inspiration of the Almighty
[54:25] for Benjamin Franklin to think about a
[54:30] electric city that we all are benefiting
[54:33] from somewhere along the line he struck
[54:39] the inspiration of the Almighty
[54:43] they were not born with tablespoon I
[54:46] mean several spoons they were not born
[54:48] with easy lives they have toughness you
[54:54] read a history they had a great
[54:57] beginning some of them were born in I
[54:59] mean look a man like do your movie just
[55:02] a shoeshine boy well right in Chicago
[55:06] now stands a library
[55:10] a university whoever told when he was on
[55:14] the under on the street shiny people
[55:17] shoes he having a shoeshine kids honor
[55:20] his arm whoever taught there will be a a
[55:23] building a university standing in
[55:26] Chicago in his name
[55:45] now like John Wesley the father of the
[55:51] Methodist revival I'll read something
[56:00] down here God keep his word let's start
[56:03] from there I'm I'm ahead of myself this
[56:06] morning that's how I roll my messages
[56:14] but it's okay you are used to it already
[56:17] so you can be able to gather it together
[56:21] praise the Lord
[56:23] where balances men and women that ever
[56:27] amount to a hill of beam has believed
[56:33] God and took God at His Word
[56:38] sometimes they have to walk I heard a
[56:41] great teacher the other morning that's
[56:45] teaching in our officers meaning of the
[56:50] morning I heard him talking about how
[56:53] precious the word was and what he had
[56:58] done true the day's how I did appreciate
[57:03] that how precious the Word of God is and
[57:07] what it has done lives that it has
[57:10] changed and it still has the power to
[57:14] change lives hearts that have mended it
[57:18] still has the power to mean hurt the
[57:20] Word of God has brought healing to live
[57:24] to family Mei said his friends that
[57:32] there has never been at any age and a
[57:36] man and a woman that ever did anything
[57:40] that amount to anything except they took
[57:44] God at His Word
[57:47] praise the Lord now sometimes we ask us
[57:54] as message student we don't we don't
[57:57] seem to
[57:58] to agree to that but we find ourselves
[58:02] in a spoken word University amen
[58:06] and you know you know taking God at this
[58:13] world when we when we when we when we
[58:15] think about that sometimes it's so easy
[58:19] for us to just think that this man they
[58:24] went with with a Bible on their chest
[58:28] sometimes it was just simple honesty it
[58:34] was just simple honesty they just choose
[58:38] to live an earnest life not to tell a
[58:40] lie if they ever told a lie they went
[58:48] back and made it right that thing I told
[58:50] you it was not right just that simple
[58:52] thing because what is truth and we say
[58:59] Jesus is the way the truth and the life
[59:02] so God would just bless a man because he
[59:05] have an earnest heart and that is the
[59:08] inspiration of the Almighty God can use
[59:12] that earnest that earnest channel to be
[59:16] able to reach that man to greatness it's
[59:24] not packing our hairs with with with
[59:27] courts studying on the book of Proverbs
[59:35] I learned that wisdom is too rightly
[59:41] applied knowledge because many people
[59:46] have knowledge this message has brought
[59:49] us a lot of knowledge about the
[59:51] unimportant God they only see em God are
[59:55] the two funny and and future whom we
[59:58] have all of this knowledge but we don't
[1:00:00] rightly apply them because we
[1:00:07] it enough to condemn others and condemn
[1:00:11] ourself to hell we are not able to use
[1:00:15] it to rise our self above situation
[1:00:20] wisdom the inspiration of the Almighty
[1:00:24] giveth wisdom wisdom is to rightly apply
[1:00:28] knowledge is to rightly apply the Word
[1:00:32] of God that's why the scripture said
[1:00:33] that's why Paul says the man of God by
[1:00:37] the inspiration of the Almighty he will
[1:00:39] rightly apply the Word of God to every
[1:00:42] situation in his life and in the life to
[1:00:46] others we all want mercy but we want to
[1:00:49] want it for ourselves what am i
[1:00:54] preaching this morning says a me where
[1:00:57] I'm a garite oh Jesus hold my hands amen
[1:01:08] in a man and a woman that ever did
[1:01:11] amount to anything
[1:01:13] amount to anything except it took God at
[1:01:17] His Word we could take all the ball
[1:01:28] fruits joy we could take the car get in
[1:01:31] and you know cheese and everything he's
[1:01:35] talking about them but what is he
[1:01:39] talking about all of those men that has
[1:01:42] been able to to give us Kogut to brush
[1:01:46] our teeth as simple as as it is
[1:01:50] chocolate for us to enjoy going to buy
[1:01:53] chocolate people that have sat down and
[1:01:56] says who I think I have a toad I can
[1:02:00] make the whole family happy now only the
[1:02:03] children the old man will also enjoy
[1:02:05] chocolate just to just to be able to
[1:02:11] bring something to make the whole family
[1:02:13] happy because it's God's desire for us
[1:02:16] to be happy
[1:02:18] so it's an inspiration of the Almighty
[1:02:21] that has trapped our main heart for him
[1:02:26] to be able to face a chocolate bar then
[1:02:30] when daddy walks through the door with a
[1:02:31] chocolate bar smile guests on everybody
[1:02:34] face because we all know we would get a
[1:02:37] treat that's the inspiration because God
[1:02:41] desire is to make his people happy but
[1:02:47] yet what we would do sometimes on a
[1:02:49] legal lesson we tell the word of God we
[1:02:52] tell the what of them we don't even give
[1:02:54] our set treat we don't give our self
[1:02:57] treat because we fail to realize that
[1:03:07] internal life in this life is just a
[1:03:11] shadow it's a faith that we holds within
[1:03:14] but we are in an earthly body so that's
[1:03:22] why better Balaam is saying here you can
[1:03:24] take the fruit the fruit of Jah you can
[1:03:28] take car gate you can take somebody that
[1:03:30] make a cheese they even come up with the
[1:03:34] idea to make cheese that we soon love
[1:03:39] cheese we can eat our burger with our
[1:03:41] cheese and as much as you will think
[1:03:50] it's an invention that he made to to
[1:03:54] make money out of it but it's something
[1:03:56] that benefited him arre praise the Lord
[1:04:01] it's something that benefit us who I've
[1:04:07] been brushing our teeth with sticks go
[1:04:11] and cut the flower and brush our teeth
[1:04:12] and you wash it you shake your mouth and
[1:04:16] you if you if you ever slept in the
[1:04:18] woods you know what it is if you ever
[1:04:21] slept in the wood and forget it carry
[1:04:23] your toothbrush you know exactly what
[1:04:24] I'm talking about you clean your teeth
[1:04:27] you scrub your tongue and everything and
[1:04:30] as soon as you shout you know exactly
[1:04:33] where you are I don't even want to go
[1:04:34] there
[1:04:34] a male s let's just stay right here amen
[1:04:40] but as as simple as these things I
[1:04:44] remember better Branham said in spoken
[1:04:46] word is that is the original C he says
[1:04:50] everything that help humanity he say is
[1:04:54] of God is of God
[1:05:08] the inspiration of the Almighty he said
[1:05:12] any of them you wish to in any man that
[1:05:14] ever meant anything look at George
[1:05:17] Washington look at Abraham Lincoln look
[1:05:23] I finly charge is Finley he's calling
[1:05:26] all of this man praise the Lord and
[1:05:33] sometimes that's what I've got that's
[1:05:36] what I'm saying here sometimes he says I
[1:05:39] say this and you search history there
[1:05:44] has never been any time you search
[1:05:47] history I was just doing a little bit of
[1:05:50] a steady yesterday because sometimes you
[1:05:53] know I was talking to someone and you
[1:05:55] see this thing where people don't
[1:05:57] appreciate you know the thing that they
[1:06:00] I appreciating brother branham message
[1:06:02] but making it to looks like everything
[1:06:05] we ever know you know brother Branham
[1:06:08] taught us and it came to him by
[1:06:11] inspiration there was there is there is
[1:06:14] something about brother Branham that we
[1:06:17] need to know where Branham he been an
[1:06:22] illiterate man he was a man that loved
[1:06:26] to read brother Branham loved looking
[1:06:29] for information he loved reading I've
[1:06:37] been coming across different things and
[1:06:40] sometimes when I when I read I just
[1:06:42] stopped and I go and make a session on
[1:06:44] it and I realized this thing is from
[1:06:47] history we just we have it we have a
[1:06:52] very sharp knowledge on it because we
[1:06:54] only take that statement that he said
[1:06:56] but for him to bring those things to us
[1:07:01] he's not only measuring you know George
[1:07:04] Washington name like we were mentioning
[1:07:06] only from the cold but he read on this
[1:07:08] man he read on them he appreciated their
[1:07:12] life well I remember many years back god
[1:07:15] I was I was preaching and I was just
[1:07:17] encouraging the young people I says read
[1:07:21] read take take books and read and the
[1:07:25] sister came to me after the service
[1:07:27] she said brother Warren are you saying
[1:07:30] you mean that we can read other books
[1:07:32] beside the message book I said oh yeah I
[1:07:36] said oh yeah and that's one of the thing
[1:07:41] that that that that is that is easily
[1:07:43] slipping out of our society with this
[1:07:46] with this technology age we have we just
[1:07:49] press google google tell me in this and
[1:07:51] and and google bring us out and we read
[1:07:53] everything that we have the knowledge on
[1:07:55] it but take it take a book and just fill
[1:08:01] this ago I was looking through looking
[1:08:04] at as I was staring on this I was
[1:08:06] looking at different men that brother
[1:08:07] branham talked about and as in a suburb
[1:08:09] read I'm talking about buying the one
[1:08:12] that wrote a paper in progress
[1:08:15] we should go brother brother even
[1:08:17] mentioned pregnant progress but how many
[1:08:19] young people have read pregnant progress
[1:08:24] how many young people have read it look
[1:08:30] the message of brother Branham is a
[1:08:32] prophetic message there are things that
[1:08:34] he said that that that I lock up in in
[1:08:38] in prophecies and so you can just take
[1:08:41] the message to think that you will be
[1:08:43] able to learn sometimes that's the
[1:08:45] reason why God we have to bring a
[1:08:47] ministry and he was I reading something
[1:08:49] that you have read over and over and it
[1:08:52] would take that ministry to open that
[1:08:54] thing to your understanding
[1:09:06] we have enough having a generation go to
[1:09:09] the library you see the people that I
[1:09:11] appreciate the library our older people
[1:09:13] the young people don't they don't want
[1:09:15] to library they're having their iPhones
[1:09:20] they're having their iPhones they're
[1:09:22] getting earbuds in your head and they
[1:09:24] shake in your hair moving you know
[1:09:26] shaking your hand that's all the one and
[1:09:30] all of those things if you see all the
[1:09:33] people that take a routine you go to the
[1:09:35] library to take a book to read all of
[1:09:37] those things help them to deal with
[1:09:39] stress because they are reading the book
[1:09:43] their spirit has traveled in that story
[1:09:47] they are finding laughter in what they
[1:09:50] are reading instead of feeling their
[1:09:52] mind was shut your media that is just
[1:09:55] vowing the final book where they are
[1:09:58] really something about history how was
[1:10:03] this invented how was that invented they
[1:10:06] are learning and when you read better
[1:10:08] bring a message you realize that this
[1:10:10] man with the less education he had he
[1:10:13] loved to read brother branham loved to
[1:10:17] read things that catch his eyes he
[1:10:19] picked it up and he read it and just a
[1:10:25] line he might find on it the inspiration
[1:10:28] of the almighty we breathed upon that he
[1:10:31] would take a story from that he would
[1:10:33] bring it to us and then what we would do
[1:10:35] we will make a doctrine out of it just
[1:10:37] from that one line
[1:10:47] before the television was was invented
[1:10:50] that's how family had happy times they
[1:10:53] take a book everybody sit around they
[1:10:55] read and laugh about it every evening
[1:10:59] they were excited whether for that time
[1:11:05] the Whitney waited for that time because
[1:11:07] to them it was there it was the
[1:11:09] entertainment it was a family time when
[1:11:13] our every every room has its television
[1:11:16] John you go in your room
[1:11:17] this other person go in there and
[1:11:18] everybody get a special movie they want
[1:11:20] to watch and all of those things have
[1:11:22] destroy the family call it have destroy
[1:11:26] the strength of the family sometimes you
[1:11:40] are saying things people want know what
[1:11:41] you get it from and it just think that
[1:11:42] you are trying to bring to your logical
[1:11:45] things into the message you go and read
[1:11:58] praise the Lord the inspiration of the
[1:12:02] Almighty he says I would say this you
[1:12:05] search history over and over brother
[1:12:07] Branham even in the church in the church
[1:12:09] ages he says if you read in history to
[1:12:14] be able to know about this man and
[1:12:16] looter and and and and carving in out of
[1:12:19] this man it was not an injure coming to
[1:12:21] tell brother Branham there were things
[1:12:23] that angel told brother Branham but
[1:12:25] there were things he read in history
[1:12:27] even when he preached the first set of
[1:12:31] the church age is the single copy it was
[1:12:33] just history that he read when they
[1:12:35] angel revealed to him then he says he
[1:12:38] said it he says when I preach the church
[1:12:40] edges first I just read from the
[1:12:42] commentary that I've got a heart it's a
[1:12:45] heart that is seeking truth the
[1:12:51] inspiration of the Almighty there is
[1:12:55] something that God find me man that he
[1:12:58] breathed upon that's a desire they say
[1:13:03] there's a character that little thing
[1:13:05] that God would find in you that you are
[1:13:09] in is about that you really want he
[1:13:16] would just find that little child and
[1:13:18] said this person always saying this
[1:13:20] they're always desiring this just like
[1:13:25] brother Branham what would it be when we
[1:13:29] leave are we going to be spirit as he
[1:13:33] keeps thinking on that God giving the
[1:13:35] privilege to go beyond the cartoon of
[1:13:36] time
[1:13:46] the inspiration of the Almighty and
[1:13:49] notice this as we go along God works
[1:13:53] with the people who stand for his word
[1:13:59] who stand for his word respecting all
[1:14:02] men is the Word of God because the Word
[1:14:04] of God said by one blood God created all
[1:14:07] man
[1:14:13] respecting your elderly is the Word of
[1:14:15] God and I could call today two men and
[1:14:26] women authors prophets prayers people
[1:14:31] that wrote he said I can call their
[1:14:36] names and everyone that ever amount to
[1:14:41] anything has been people like Killip and
[1:14:46] Joshua who may be a stain internally on
[1:14:52] God's Word the word will stand forever
[1:15:02] praise the Lord great men are not always
[1:15:06] wise they were not born with greatness
[1:15:12] they were born with a humble beginning
[1:15:15] some of them were not even educated they
[1:15:20] were not even educated look at look at
[1:15:22] young man like like Joseph his entire
[1:15:25] child who was stripped away from him
[1:15:31] when young people complain and says yeah
[1:15:34] you know this message make us we don't
[1:15:36] enjoy our youthfulness or our friends
[1:15:39] can do this you don't see the blessing
[1:15:41] that the message the China that it gives
[1:15:44] you because you go out and expose
[1:15:49] yourself to those things it's a that
[1:15:51] this flesh have a sticky nature it
[1:15:54] sticks on those things and
[1:15:58] it goes with you for a long time look at
[1:16:04] young male like down here
[1:16:05] he proposed in his heart and because he
[1:16:08] purposed in his heart he opened a
[1:16:11] channel that the inspiration of the
[1:16:13] almighty could drop true and God bless
[1:16:16] him why he was yet in Aires aiya god
[1:16:19] bless him
[1:16:29] men and women true true the history
[1:16:34] Berta Branham talks about Fanny Crosby
[1:16:37] will read about her in a little bit she
[1:16:42] never took her blindness to make excuse
[1:16:46] she never used her blindness to to play
[1:16:49] the victim oh I'm blind that's why I'm
[1:16:52] like this
[1:16:57] but even though she couldn't see the
[1:17:00] world around her by year by her
[1:17:02] inspiration she created a word for
[1:17:05] people to travel through she couldn't
[1:17:09] see the world around her she couldn't
[1:17:12] see the flowers and that I mean the
[1:17:14] brightness of the of the Sun but here by
[1:17:17] her inspiration the things she wrote the
[1:17:21] songs she sang the inspiration of the
[1:17:24] Almighty people look down through
[1:17:29] history and it says oh this person did
[1:17:32] this but all the father in their life
[1:17:35] that they were smoking so they were not
[1:17:37] a Christian praise the Lord but they
[1:17:41] were doing something right that God
[1:17:43] bless that is the conflict that is in a
[1:17:48] spirit of the generation that is
[1:17:51] destroying the history that has been
[1:17:55] written across the world the breaking I
[1:17:58] may destroy money money or bad
[1:18:06] there are people that carry this Bible
[1:18:10] they have worked for the devil out of
[1:18:13] their lives and men that didn't even
[1:18:17] read a Bible but their desire to do one
[1:18:20] good thing for Humanity God blessed God
[1:18:25] inspire them inspiration of the Almighty
[1:18:32] give it wisdom when God can find that
[1:18:38] China in your heart the desire you have
[1:18:41] that burden you have he can find it it's
[1:18:44] not selfish you are not looking for your
[1:18:46] own name you just have a heart to help
[1:18:50] people man like Nelson Mandela there was
[1:18:59] a problem Nelson Mandela had when he
[1:19:02] came came out of prison and became the
[1:19:04] president everybody - oh yeah now it's
[1:19:06] the time now where the black South
[1:19:08] Africans will revenge on the people he
[1:19:10] said no that was not what I was fighting
[1:19:13] for he says that was not what I was
[1:19:18] fighting for however has all I I mean he
[1:19:25] deceived us it's time for us to to
[1:19:29] furnish back sometimes this man that got
[1:19:35] this inspiration never even fully honest
[1:19:38] or they never even fully honest - they
[1:19:43] just have that channel God dropped down
[1:19:45] in that China give them the burden for
[1:19:47] them to do something just to be able to
[1:19:49] start it and go a raise of other men
[1:19:52] that will be able to run with this
[1:20:00] you think about poor he was Caelius
[1:20:05] after the God of Israel
[1:20:08] he was just like David caelius all in
[1:20:12] his mind these fanatics calling himself
[1:20:15] Christine they are not standing for the
[1:20:17] word even though he was in Iran said he
[1:20:21] was in the wrong group of his hat was
[1:20:23] right his heart was right because he
[1:20:26] wanted to stand for God and because he
[1:20:29] wanted to stand for God God met him and
[1:20:32] make him to stand for God against the
[1:20:35] very thing that he was persecuting when
[1:20:39] a man have a right heart when a man
[1:20:44] weighs please the Lord where belem talks
[1:20:54] about all of these people he talks about
[1:21:02] Eddie he says he says when he was
[1:21:05] writing he couldn't sell his books there
[1:21:09] was nothing that seems to go right for
[1:21:13] him he had an inspiration he's writing
[1:21:15] nothing seems to go right until one day
[1:21:17] it struck him when he wrote that song oh
[1:21:22] he'll the power of Jesus name the
[1:21:25] inspiration strikes him his name got in
[1:21:32] the pages of history from the little
[1:21:37] writings he was doing trying to do
[1:21:40] something to inspire people nobody knew
[1:21:43] him but when he put his his pen to the
[1:21:49] paper and God is spam or he'll oh hell
[1:21:56] oh wow we sing that song to the National
[1:21:59] item or here or here to the name of
[1:22:01] Jesus that is biracial struck him he put
[1:22:05] his name
[1:22:13] the inspiration of the almighty Fanny
[1:22:24] Crosby when they were criticizing her
[1:22:26] about her sons trying to get her to
[1:22:29] write worldly sons being morning when
[1:22:36] the morning ever press listen he sees or
[1:22:38] somebody on one of these other modern
[1:22:45] singers you know you're writing about
[1:22:49] Jesus said Jesus what are you blind
[1:22:58] writing about God what are you blind
[1:23:00] it's just a story you open the answer
[1:23:03] blind and you writing about him why he
[1:23:05] can open your eyes
[1:23:14] sometimes the devil get us into that
[1:23:17] little corner and we sass the reason but
[1:23:21] Baron says everything he told me was the
[1:23:24] truth
[1:23:26] he was caught right into that China of
[1:23:28] reasoning with the devil he says
[1:23:31] everything he told me was the truth
[1:23:38] it took the inspiration of the Almighty
[1:23:40] God to get him out of that channel of
[1:23:45] thought
[1:23:54] great men are not always wise it's the
[1:23:58] inspiration of the Almighty that give it
[1:24:01] wisdom is the inspiration of the
[1:24:05] Almighty that wrote their names across
[1:24:08] history that we can refer back to them
[1:24:13] just that inspiration it overshadow all
[1:24:17] the wrong that they have done because
[1:24:20] there was a China that God who breathed
[1:24:22] through them and it could do things to
[1:24:25] be a blessing to mankind
[1:24:36] where banishes men and women brothers
[1:24:39] sister let me tell you people who amount
[1:24:42] to anything and will amount to anything
[1:24:45] in this church amount to anything in the
[1:24:50] generation to come its men and women who
[1:24:52] stand on God's Word and call everything
[1:24:56] as sinking sand on Christ the solid rock
[1:24:59] I stand Caleb said we are more than able
[1:25:05] to take it no matter what the opposition
[1:25:09] is young people we are more than able
[1:25:14] this is our generation this is our time
[1:25:18] no matter what the word says what a
[1:25:21] thing we are more than able to stand for
[1:25:24] God in this age let's see an increase
[1:25:33] righteousness were also increase in us
[1:25:36] God would give us grace God says so so
[1:25:41] let's go and get it you'll find out they
[1:25:45] were their only tool of that generation
[1:25:50] that God to go over I don't care what
[1:25:55] the church says what the neighbor says
[1:25:58] what this is and what that says let take
[1:26:02] God at His Word and let's stay right on
[1:26:06] it God is obligated to take care of us
[1:26:11] he's obligated because God will keep his
[1:26:16] word the inspiration of the Almighty the
[1:26:24] inspiration of the Almighty Lord
[1:26:29] just breathe upon me today that can be
[1:26:33] an encouragement to somebody now even
[1:26:37] knowing who the person is going to be
[1:26:42] but you just want that breath of God not
[1:26:45] to be able to me
[1:26:47] the opportunity when it presents itself
[1:26:52] because we meet people we see people we
[1:26:55] get in our self-righteous jacket
[1:27:13] Pepa strain perfect weakness he says
[1:27:15] there is so many of us like to testify
[1:27:20] or like to think that we are
[1:27:22] insufficient we think we need to get to
[1:27:29] the set in place before we can really be
[1:27:31] able to live for God he says therefore
[1:27:33] we make an excuse I have no education I
[1:27:38] have no ability I'm unable to do this
[1:27:40] and if you keep that up and do that in
[1:27:45] that way keep going like that then you
[1:27:50] cannot amount to anything
[1:27:58] as a little boy I used to like seeing
[1:28:02] the lasers we used to have lasers all
[1:28:04] over the trees over the house
[1:28:06] you know they climb up and trying to run
[1:28:08] up the tree that goes I'm going to come
[1:28:11] down on the ground they knocked himself
[1:28:13] on the ground they shake their head I
[1:28:15] can do it you always shake their heads
[1:28:20] like this and tell this I can do it they
[1:28:28] encouraged himself and they go back
[1:28:30] again when it comes slam on the ground
[1:28:34] say yes I can do it I'm going to do it
[1:28:47] praise the Lord my new ministry he says
[1:28:52] you don't have to be rich Almighty in
[1:28:55] this word to get to be great in the
[1:29:00] sight of God you don't have to be humble
[1:29:03] in your heart and God called that
[1:29:08] greatness he that great enough to Humble
[1:29:12] himself that's a great person takes the
[1:29:17] blame for everything that will humble
[1:29:21] himself he says that is greatness and as
[1:29:26] you read this you find many places where
[1:29:28] Berta Bram talks about standing alone
[1:29:31] with the word of God and and sometimes
[1:29:33] that has giving people an hour again
[1:29:35] attitude where they think they can stand
[1:29:36] alone no man can stand alone and survive
[1:29:41] you have to read and understand the
[1:29:43] context in which brother Branham is
[1:29:45] talking standing with the word of God it
[1:29:49] has made people to separate himself from
[1:29:51] the body of Christ stay in your own home
[1:29:54] and they think that he can they can
[1:29:56] stand alone with God when you do like
[1:29:59] that the devil makes everybody around
[1:30:01] you wrong honor you right it makes you
[1:30:05] to find fault in every home I met you to
[1:30:07] find fault in every Church
[1:30:15] well Roberto Sam I must stand alone with
[1:30:17] God's Word I'm standing alone with God's
[1:30:19] Word
[1:30:25] praise the Lord I love you this he said
[1:30:28] this also in Jehovah Jireh he said
[1:30:31] Abraham talking about Abraham he went
[1:30:33] back and got his old son he loved God
[1:30:38] better then he loved his own son
[1:30:42] listening to this now he says brother if
[1:30:45] you were ever amount to anything you
[1:30:47] have got to love God better than your
[1:30:50] wife then your husband praise the Lord
[1:30:57] if you take but if you take that
[1:31:02] expression in an exclusive tot you would
[1:31:06] destroy yourself you would destroy your
[1:31:08] family because you cannot love God
[1:31:11] better until you love your wife you love
[1:31:15] your husband you love your children
[1:31:18] without condition so a better Balaam
[1:31:23] saying you must love God better than
[1:31:25] your wife and you start this passing
[1:31:27] your were thinking that you are loving
[1:31:29] God better you would destroy yourself
[1:31:31] you would destroy your family
[1:31:39] Lavagirl better than your wife is to
[1:31:42] love her with our condition is to love
[1:31:49] your children with our condition love
[1:31:52] your husband with our condition then you
[1:31:55] are loving God better than loving your
[1:31:57] husband because if you love your husband
[1:32:00] or your wife with condition it will
[1:32:05] limit you on loving God and keeping
[1:32:07] God's Word the inspiration of the
[1:32:12] Almighty that's why I give wisdom when
[1:32:15] God breathed his word he opened our
[1:32:18] understanding open our spirit for all to
[1:32:23] get out of
[1:32:23] being critical and criticizing people
[1:32:26] and just- we just take our spirit that
[1:32:32] God can die even breathe through us
[1:32:35] living dead because we are just we are
[1:32:44] just credit card of of everybody
[1:32:46] criticize everything nothing is right
[1:32:49] the whole world is burning it's only
[1:32:50] where we are standing that's that's
[1:32:52] that's the only place that is secure
[1:32:58] knowing God better than your wife is to
[1:33:02] love her with our condition is to be
[1:33:05] able to look beyond all her faults and
[1:33:07] still love her
[1:33:09] loving God better than your husband is
[1:33:11] to do the same the love of God will come
[1:33:16] right in here and be able to support the
[1:33:18] children that's loving God better than
[1:33:23] your children because it is if it is
[1:33:26] only for them you will not do what you
[1:33:28] are doing but you love God so you have
[1:33:29] to do it that's the love of God the
[1:33:36] inspiration of the Almighty give it
[1:33:40] wisdom when God found their little
[1:33:44] channel in you he found that little
[1:33:47] hunger in your heart he found our little
[1:33:50] earnest in your heart he found a little
[1:33:53] desire to do right I know I'm not doing
[1:33:58] right but lord help me to do right I
[1:34:01] never get over this thing I'm better
[1:34:03] than this thing when you keep telling
[1:34:05] yourself that you are better than your
[1:34:07] weakness that you are better not to make
[1:34:12] excuses all the madam I've done my
[1:34:14] father all that my parents and not know
[1:34:17] that excuse is here you take
[1:34:21] responsibility for your actions and you
[1:34:23] tell yourself I'm better than this I can
[1:34:27] do better than what I'm doing and go
[1:34:33] we'll just find that channel that's what
[1:34:35] he's looking for in the heart of man
[1:34:37] he's looking for the channel that he can
[1:34:39] breathe true to make you a better wife
[1:34:42] he's looking for the channel he can
[1:34:44] breathe true to make you a better
[1:34:46] husband he's looking for that channel
[1:34:48] that he can breathe true to bring you in
[1:34:53] peace with the ones that you use just so
[1:34:56] hard for you to be in peace with you

[1:35:24] us make man in our image he was not just
[1:35:28] going to make something that he was not
[1:35:30] going to identify with he made something
[1:35:33] and he identified with and he put his
[1:35:35] life in it he breathed in man that is
[1:35:43] the best way to make anything it's for
[1:35:47] you to identify with faith and make a
[1:35:49] better husband you got to identify with

[1:44:16] Jesus if I will say he grew in stature
[1:44:21] of men and wisdom Christ Jesus they want
[1:44:30] to be the Redeemer of the world God in
[1:44:32] the form of man he learned obedience by
[1:44:36] the things he suffer he didn't say I'm
[1:44:42] the God of the universe
[1:44:43] he got himself a train he was a
[1:44:45] carpenter he helped his momma Mary just
[1:44:50] been a time he was wisdom for us wisdom
[1:44:55] Christ Jesus made unto us wisdom and
[1:45:00] righteousness and sanctification and
[1:45:03] redemption all was found in this man he
[1:45:11] was made all of these things for us he
[1:45:14] was despised so when you are despised
[1:45:17] you enough he saw hurt he was rejected
[1:45:20] when you are rejected you when I feel so
[1:45:22] hurt why you feel bad when you are
[1:45:29] disappointed you disappoint God all the
[1:45:31] time just reckon with faith he was made
[1:45:38] all of these things the inspiration of
[1:45:42] the Almighty
[1:45:43] put him in a body of flesh the
[1:45:46] inspiration of the Almighty made him toe
[1:45:49] to look at it I mean being there his own
[1:45:53] bourbon said when he got down there in
[1:45:56] the Garden of Gethsemane to just rock on
[1:46:01] at a place where he kneeled that he was
[1:46:05] going to be crucified it never came so
[1:46:08] easy
[1:46:09] it's not my will but your will be done
[1:46:11] never came so easy where bam says all
[1:46:14] the shadow of death was over his head
[1:46:19] Noorie him been innocent to take the
[1:46:25] place of the guilty he was in a boarding
[1:46:27] sometimes that's a reason why we
[1:46:29] struggle with this thing we don't want
[1:46:31] for people to talk bad about it's all
[1:46:33] because of this flesh this flesh has a
[1:46:35] sense of pride it's a seed proud make
[1:46:40] this flesh to fall it's there that's why
[1:46:45] he prayed that's why he prayed it was
[1:46:47] not just uneasy surrounding not my will
[1:46:50] let your will be done it was not easy he
[1:46:54] had to pray until he sweat as brother
[1:46:57] branham said he pray the scripture said
[1:47:00] he pray in agony oh god help me
[1:47:13] that's the reason why we we don't just
[1:47:16] dancing triose because the flesh don't
[1:47:20] want it the spirit knows that Trier is
[1:47:24] going to be a character for you but this
[1:47:26] flesh just don't want it lazy it's just
[1:47:29] one is so easy you even give it easy it
[1:47:31] one more easier the inspiration of the
[1:47:39] Almighty when we going through tough
[1:47:42] time when we're going through things
[1:47:44] that we don't understand that
[1:47:46] inspiration of the Almighty is what owe
[1:47:49] us
[1:47:50] that's what horrors from within it's the
[1:47:56] breath of God is the life of God great
[1:48:02] man and I always wise successful husband
[1:48:07] they were not just born to be husband
[1:48:09] you know smart and going to be chosen no
[1:48:12] it's the inspiration they pray for their
[1:48:14] family when you see things in your wives
[1:48:20] they don't just shout and complain you
[1:48:23] dance you're you a dancer you're
[1:48:24] distance they they see those things they
[1:48:28] go only Annie's law help my wife I know
[1:48:30] she won't be a good woman successful mom
[1:48:37] do the same thing for their children
[1:48:43] they do the same thing for their husband
[1:48:50] because we all comes with this
[1:48:52] expectation
[1:48:58] but the inspiration of the almighty had
[1:49:01] us to surrender our expectation to him
[1:49:06] because no man can fulfill your
[1:49:08] expectation I can fulfill your
[1:49:09] expectation I can fulfill your
[1:49:13] expectation I mean for the past that you
[1:49:16] drag out a bear with me
[1:49:21] you just got a bear with me or just fire
[1:49:28] me but it's the inspiration of the
[1:49:34] almighty that hold us together as a
[1:49:36] church because your heart is desiring to
[1:49:40] see God in our mace and the heart of the
[1:49:45] preacher is also desiring to see God in
[1:49:48] the people that desire that we have God
[1:49:52] comes true there he breathed upon us we
[1:49:57] can be able to encourage one another
[1:50:00] we can be able to look over the flaws of
[1:50:03] one another that's the inspiration of
[1:50:05] the Almighty that give it wisdom because
[1:50:12] if the inspiration of the Almighty was
[1:50:14] not there we become so particular this
[1:50:17] is what we want and we start to tear one
[1:50:20] another apart and we start to criticize
[1:50:26] who be using our own teeth to dig our
[1:50:29] grave but when the inspiration of the
[1:50:33] Almighty come and come true the hunger
[1:50:36] in of our hearts come true the desire
[1:50:49] you just got to stay back listening a
[1:50:53] little bit and see how the inspiration
[1:50:56] of the Almighty have our assembling even
[1:51:02] with the music and the singing and
[1:51:04] everything that we have it was it was
[1:51:07] just a desire to praise God the people
[1:51:11] desiring to worship God is spirit any
[1:51:13] truth they'll bring new songs we sing it
[1:51:20] off beat we stay enjoyed praise the Lord
[1:51:31] as he singing a song trying to sing a
[1:51:35] song for us Elaine and brother Lord said
[1:51:38] no no no no no no no stop no no no no he
[1:51:41] says no no no no no we completely off
[1:51:45] it's a heart to help if I take offense
[1:51:51] in there and get my flesh in a way then
[1:51:55] it just keep God of the same it's a
[1:52:00] heart to help the inspiration of the
[1:52:06] Almighty he comes through that channel
[1:52:14] he just don't condemn everything you you
[1:52:17] have why because he knows that he
[1:52:19] depending on that ability that's what
[1:52:22] we're Brenham syria in a perfect
[1:52:24] straining perfect weakness I was reading
[1:52:29] the thing and I just got off it that's
[1:52:31] the same thing he's here here he said
[1:52:36] you say I have no ability I'm unable to
[1:52:39] do this and if you keep that up he says
[1:52:43] you are going if you keep there or keep
[1:52:47] going their way
[1:52:48] then you can amount to anything but the
[1:52:52] very thing that we make excuses but our
[1:52:57] weakness God use the very thing
[1:53:01] to tackle the job he will use that very
[1:53:07] thing that you making excuses off I'm
[1:53:11] not good I'm not ready he will use that
[1:53:13] very thing to keep you from trouble he
[1:53:21] don't want you to be a Hollywood star so
[1:53:22] he just gives you a special you're just
[1:53:25] peculiar special to him and you have to
[1:53:30] appreciate that because he's going to
[1:53:32] use that very thing to tackle the job to
[1:53:34] make the devil know like you are not
[1:53:36] just like if you're not going to for
[1:53:39] them you're not just going to back up on
[1:53:42] the word verbatim says that's what this
[1:53:46] bright God has designed her in this way
[1:53:50] in this age that's a very thing that God
[1:53:56] used to tackle the job he will for us to
[1:53:59] get to that condition so that he can use
[1:54:03] us he wait for you to get in there
[1:54:06] condition maybe that's the way he could
[1:54:09] get you humble maybe that's the way you
[1:54:11] could make me two less thing you're
[1:54:13] running too fast so he put you in that
[1:54:17] condition as a check he can use that and
[1:54:24] get the job done the inspiration of the
[1:54:27] almighty the inspiration of the Almighty
[1:54:34] look at brother Branham look at his life
[1:54:38] story a father that was a drunk he never
[1:54:47] came from the royal family a father that
[1:54:50] was a drunk never came from the
[1:54:53] Pentecostal home where they were praying
[1:54:54] all night mother a Catholic great men
[1:55:00] I'm not always wise they were now born
[1:55:05] with silver spoon
[1:55:10] there was a place that God phone India
[1:55:12] heart and he breath the breath of life
[1:55:16] in that place and wrote their name
[1:55:19] across history
[1:55:29] and I believe that he can find out same
[1:55:33] place in our hearts he can find that
[1:55:37] same place in our heart if we just get
[1:55:41] away from being critical get away from I
[1:55:47] was just self praising
[1:55:48] self-righteousness he said David I took
[1:55:54] you from the Sheep card and not giving
[1:55:56] you a name I'm giving you a name in
[1:56:04] Israel and even if your son's fail I'll
[1:56:11] never take that name off talk to you
[1:56:16] from a humble beginning I talked you
[1:56:18] from following sheep's he wrote David
[1:56:23] name in the heart of him man whose name
[1:56:30] I written in the heart of him go back
[1:56:33] and read their history I was reading
[1:56:43] about Geronimo his name's two out among
[1:56:49] the Indians but there was something that
[1:56:57] put his name dear
[1:57:00] the first time I said young man that he
[1:57:03] will see his tribe being abused our men
[1:57:08] came over from Mexico and run them over
[1:57:12] and burned there and burned their little
[1:57:14] town their little place they have I said
[1:57:15] young man he was just a young man they
[1:57:21] were gone away and when he came back
[1:57:23] their little village was burned
[1:57:30] the desire in his heart that I wish I
[1:57:35] would have been the one that was killed
[1:57:39] just for this whole village to live I
[1:57:42] wish I would have been the one that that
[1:57:47] inspiration took that young man over
[1:57:53] until and more on the others that's
[1:57:57] where his name came from that's that's
[1:58:00] worthy the frame came from because they
[1:58:02] ever saw that the passion that he had he
[1:58:06] will go away from the town and he was
[1:58:08] just cry he would cry he would cry he
[1:58:12] was fine it was almost like he was he
[1:58:17] was going mad he was lost in its life
[1:58:25] because they killed his mother
[1:58:29] it was that thing it was nothing you
[1:58:35] know that Geronimo went to church oh
[1:58:38] yeah history tells he went to church and
[1:58:45] when he started going to church
[1:58:46] he started appreciating because there
[1:58:50] that that name that give him they feel
[1:58:54] like it was the spirit of the Gods that
[1:58:57] have come upon that young man because he
[1:59:02] didn't care for his life so him it was
[1:59:05] better for him to die than to see his
[1:59:08] people suffering so when he went for a
[1:59:12] walk he threw his all into it sometimes
[1:59:16] he came back wounded but he had a spirit
[1:59:20] to go they will advise him not to go he
[1:59:23] were conspiring two to three of his
[1:59:25] friends they were escaped they will go
[1:59:28] back to war that spirit in him they just
[1:59:31] felt like it was it was a spirit of the
[1:59:34] god stop taking flesh and morning
[1:59:41] it was just that China just like shim
[1:59:48] guy he was not a warrior never knew
[1:59:52] nothing about war but when that place
[1:59:54] opening is harder I'd rather die than to
[1:59:59] see the Philistines running over my
[2:00:01] people
[2:00:04] God just drop right in there it's the
[2:00:11] heart

[2:08:47] to the simple messages of repentance
[2:08:50] that Billy Graham will bring think about
[2:08:52] even man like Billy Graham how he rose
[2:08:57] up to greatness
[2:08:59] he had a frame someone that was like his
[2:09:03] mentor and this person came to the place
[2:09:07] they could not understand why the Jews
[2:09:09] were suffering him and decided to troll
[2:09:11] the tower in and throw their Bible down
[2:09:14] venogram as a young man he struggled he
[2:09:19] struggle because he couldn't understand
[2:09:21] it but he just had that china open and
[2:09:24] he says I know that there is a God I
[2:09:28] don't understand why but I know that
[2:09:32] there is a God and because he kept that
[2:09:35] China open God came through there god
[2:09:38] bless him and God rose him up to
[2:09:40] greatness
[2:09:47] you might not understand what is
[2:09:49] happening in your life I don't have
[2:09:51] explanation for some of those things I
[2:09:53] just want to try by the grace of God to

[2:10:46] I'm the I'm the reason but I can do
[2:10:50] better than this
[2:10:53] because I serve a great god and it's
[2:10:57] written in his word greater is He that
[2:10:58] is in me than he that is in the world
[2:11:04] that's all God is looking for he's just
