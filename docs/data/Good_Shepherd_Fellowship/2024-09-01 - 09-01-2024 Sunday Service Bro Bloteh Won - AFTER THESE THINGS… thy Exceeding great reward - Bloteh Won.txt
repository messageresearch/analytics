have him come up uh a little bit and just and just bring uh uh greetings uh be able to greet us officially since uh since he been he came and uh so blessing come come in and uh praise the Lord use this Mark don't be afraid of the PO okay amen my name is blessings and uh I came here with my family can you please just stand up uh so that I can see you so that is my my beautiful wife that's what may what to say her name is uh if you fail to pronounce it just say CH whatever you can try to to say it whatever and then uh my first BN over there uh she's so if you fail to pronounce it too hard just say that is that is easier and then the boy there is wat uh you can just call him watti or I think that's and then I have twin boys there they called M so in brief you can just say TK and then MD I think that's much easiest way uh we we're staying in champing uh it's now 3 months in us uh we staying in Norway before and before staying in Norway we originally from Malawi Africa thank you [Applause] praise the Lord he got a little feeling of how much the poop it it makes you nervous you get back here you want to get out of here quickly praise the Lord I I I had a privilege to go down to visit with brother brother blessing at the first time he came uh you know there was a note that came up in and brother blessing so normally with us in West Africa most of the time is the women that carry blessing so I thought it was the wife name but then when I saw the soul name and then so in my mind I said okay he should be from somewhere South in Africa because South in Africa Zimbabwe Zambia and and and Malawi most of the brothers also blessing so uh so then after I found out he was from Malawi I got excited there something that make me excited when I came back came to the message back u in the early 90s uh uh there was a testimony that came out of Malawi that was one of the first Supernatural uh testimony there we were exposed to okay remember we were all young people at that time so uh uh uh uh we got a copy of one of uh I think brother Paul Fountain uh they were doing the quick the youth quick news so there was uh either that came from Brother Paula fountain or it might have come from brother had Bryant one of the two but what actually it was there were some Believers in Malawi at the time you know uh uh these sisters they were part of the some group that were you know noted of going to receive the president at the airport uh you know we uh uh in Africa we know that you know certain group that would go and dance you know and you know make some display at the airport when officials are coming so they were part of that and then uh they got they believe the message so uh now they will not they don't want to expose them themselves that way because pretty much they they are undressed or not dressing proper let me say it that way and uh so they they choose not to do that and and uh because of that the the Believers came under uh political pressure you know for the fact that these uh young people were traced back to a certain message group so they came under pressure for that and uh uh you just just remember now this is this is from the '90s I'm trying to put everything together in my mind praise the Lord just paraphrasing here so but what was beautiful you know some of these people were arrested and they were put into prison and they were they were you know they were offered to either deny their faith and get Freedom or they will stay in prison and then uh uh uh the the most part of faith that were that became very very the uh inspiring or the Supernatural part of Faith uh because the the the sisters refused they were going to cut their head so the the praising praising God you know choose to cut their head took a Caesar and his Jesus could not go through their head praise the Lord and I think uh I think some of some of the praising guys got uh convicted by that you know and then it it started another you know uh Revival in in Malawi so just imagine now kind of a testimony like they got in our hands you know in our hands you know so I mean everybody wanted to see a supernatural amen I remember I remember a sister and uh uh Evelyn you know uh I think she was there with uh brother brother and sister we in their Church there Evelyn at the time came uh uh into the message and she was from uh uh uh family that were you know they were uh in the Catholic church and then uh you know uh because of you know her dedication there I mean there were just there were just a lot of things that were happening so she she her parents you know uh I think her dad had to punish her that time and she even had to go to praison but but it was it was it was that testimony that was kind of for inspiring us you know we wanted to see the god of Malawi in Liberia at the time praise the Lord so uh so when I heard he was from Malawi I said okay I got to chase this guy down so as soon now we sat down for a few minutes that's the first thing I asked him hey my friend there was a testimony I heard many years ago praise the Lord and it turned out to be you know his his D and the rest of them there he also knew about it so uh uh that was that was beautiful it's good to see an eyewitness amen praise Lord we we can you can talk about it but when you see an eyewitness you know that he was there amen and it gains kind of for a flame your faith he's the same yesterday today and forever the god of Malawi can be the god of Brooklyn Center this morning amen just as a young believer that never it never leaves me you know as a young believer that was something that captured me at the time and and for every one of us that was around the Lord bless you let's uh let's stand to our feet thank you musicians and uh uh we will praise the Lord thank you musicians uh just for a reminder we have a communion service tonight and uh all that would love to partake you are welcome and uh uh so uh that means uh brother one please don't keep the people long you know the scripture say You must talk to yourself amen you must talk to yourself and sometimes it's good to have an Earnest conversation to Yourself Praise the Lord amen and the Lord bless you Genesis chapter 15 Genesis chapter 15 verse one Genesis chapter 15 I think this is just a good time for me to do this uh I got I got captured to this subject uh long time ago I was just thinking when is a good time to do it but what makes it a good time like I said this is a good time what makes it a good time is because just last week or a week before we were reading from Revelation chapter 4 and we entitle our message after this so today is going to be after these things kind of a parallel and you will see it when we when if the Lord put his Blessing on it and as we go along so Genesis chapter 15 verse1 let's read it together if you can see on the board or read it from the Bible let's read it together after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am their shed and their exceeding great reward I am th shade and th exceeding great reward let's pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus we want to commit ourself this morning into your hands Lord we want to thank you Father for giving us another opportunity Lord God that we can come together this morning to Fellowship around your word father we want to use the service this morning prepare our hearts and mind even though God for the service this evening we just I want to thank you thank you for the son service Lord thank you for the praise that came out of the hearts of your people out of their mind oh god father and we just appreciate you we ask your help this morning come and help us Lord as we take your word now and approach your people come and break break the bread of life to us in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so this morning we want to speak on after these things the exceeding great reward after these things that exceeding great reward or I want I can say after these things come th exceeding great reward after these things that exceeding great reward praise the Lord after these things now you have to remember now in Revelation chapter 4 we said after this after this and we were able to identify that that was just after the church ages praise the Lord amen is uh uh did we did we all grab that identification and uh so uh after these things we want to also be able to see what are those things you know when when you read the Bible like that don't go further go back and say what what actually after these things what things praise the Lord there is something that have just happened and after that experience God is now showing himself to Abraham in another manifestation after these things the name Jehovah nii is birth I'm your Sheed I'm your Defender I'm the one that will cover you I will protect you so God is telling Abraham after something have happened after an experience he's bringing Abraham into another form of relationship making himself more real amen praise the Lord amen making himself more real he's bringing Abraham into a further revelation of himself just like John was experiencing on the island of pmos Abraham is experiencing a further revelation of God after these things the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision I am that shade that constant covering I will protect you I will cover you amen praise the praise the Lord amen amen I will be at your back yes Lord amen constant covering and protection amen and I am your great and exceeding praise the Lord amen amen I am your great and exceeding reward Genesis ch chapter 14 let's see what happened after what praise the Lord am after what are we together praise the Lord after what now you can read the entire chapter the picture you will get here is that lot has been captured and Abra Abraham has has armed his men he took the CPO he took the knife he took the steak he took the hul he took whatever he can take from in his house and distribute it to his men and say let's go and get my nephew praise the Lord amen amen whatever he could take in his hands the Broom the uh the plow W 2x4 whatever he could take he just distribute it to all his seven and said let's go and get my nephew Genesis 14 and uh Abraham going to rescue lot and the king of Sodom praise the Lord but that's not what we want to look at this morning let's drop down to verse 18 and MDC the king of salum brought for Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him blessed Abraham and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which have delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all Abraham gave him tide of all Maes that gave Abraham Bread and Wine praise the Lord after these things then God appeared to Abraham in the vision after this experience praise the Lord amen something brought Abraham to this place after Abraham have got himself involved in the ministry of reconciliation after Abraham has got himself involved in going after a lost brother or a lost sister he was he was at peace they were not coming after him he was not in trouble but it was lot that was in trouble praise the Lord amen amen Abraham could have said well that's his choice and let him deal with it praise the Lord but his some of Courage when he heard about it and he went after lot went after those men and he was able not only to rescue lot but to rescue uh the king of Sodom and and all of the the people that were captured at the time all the official remember uh uh lot was made a major of the city so they they capture all the officials let's say it that way so he was able to deliver all the officiers but after he he did that then he he had a supernatural experience MDC this man that Paul spoke about in The Book of Hebrew and said he was with our father with our mother without beginning of Day Without End of This praise the Lord amen and who Could That Be who Could That Be God we are believers praise the Lord Believers should not be afraid of the word amen amen that was God so here is God in uh in uh in in a in in another form there is God stepping in as the priest of Sal the priest of peace and he's bringing Abraham into an experience he's bringing Abraham into an experience praise the Lord amen God bless you amen than and uh so what we want to look at this morning by the help of God we want to look at two scripture biblical principle that runs through the scripture that is tied to the New Testament Church that is tied to to Bible Believers so yeah we will find this is the first time that God will give us a glimpse of what is associated to the church as commum amen this is where communion was birth a after the battle was over after we have overcome praise the Lord amen so communion is an actart of overcoming it's an actart of bringing something subject to you after the battle was over so we see two principle things here that is established right here communion and tithe praise the Lord amen so what the way I want us to look at it is that this is something that Abraham is the father of our faith amen so God attach this thing right to the beginning of our faith so we can see how important it is it is not just you know uh uh a ritual thing is something that is deeply grounded in our faith and as we look at it this morning you will realize that it also shows our growth we've been talking about further Revelation we've been talking about growing in in the Lord and uh I've been around grow for the while so that's that's the place I want to go so it's it shows a sense of our growth when people run away from communion some people have to work some people you know uh they have things on their mind is is they are not really running away it's just because they can't be there this time but if people shot away because they think that well oh you know I have to make this right if you have to make it right make it right when are you waiting for amen if you have to make it right get on your knees and make it right praise the Lord amen I mean it's not it's not something like you have to return the money back to the bank if so then carry it back praise the Lord amen if so then carry it back you know because uh uh uh and and and and the way we want to go with this is to be able to see because what actually that what actually God is bringing us out of God is bringing us out of all the all the way that the church has affected us all the way that denominationalism has affected us many times we think we are in a message we are not in denomination but some of our attitude is an effect from denomination amen praise the Lord because Paul says the Lord is NY right if you believe the Lord in your heart and confess with your mouth you don't have to come to the church you don't have to wait for a special day he's just a breath away praise the Lord amen and oh yeah I know I know I know there you know there's there's the group there that also say you know we having every time we we preach the world we are having communion it's a spiritual communion you see because this principle is is placed in the church as as we see we go along is placed in the church God is hold holding us accountable of his life that he gave us and and and if we will be Earnest with ourself many of the people churches and and and people Believers that shi away from communion is because there is a haunting thought that our life is not right why because the Scripture plac it before us if we do it un waterly yes that's the reason why many I don't want to die right I don't want to die so the Bible says you do that thing on water you will die praise the Lord amen amen but Jesus also said if you don't do it then you are also guilty right of his blood and his body so there is no way to escape the easier way is to make your life right and do it amen if you are not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ get baptized are we together you see the reason there is because it takes the power and authority of the the Lord Jesus Christ from the church right you are not allowing God to be active in the church you are not allowing God to be active in your life why because you are at a stering you are the one in control praise the Lord amen so just like we talking about John experience uh uh uh uh you know he was caught up in the Spirit come up higher you know uh uh uh uh there we want to we want to go back a little bit because I mean we can go into the Mysteries and we can talk about all the revelations but let's let's just do some ground workor amen because if we go up high and we don't prepare the ground when we fall we will feed it so let's prepare the ground amen amen are we together praise the Lord amen are you ready for the word am amen amen are you comfortable with me speaking on this talking about communion talking about Tiding are you comfortable praise the Lord you know the most person we seek to be comfortable is the Lord Jesus we just want to bring ourself into his comfort amen after these things God revealing himself to Abraham that I am your sheep and that exceeding great reward after these things after mesc appeared to Abraham and S him communion bread and wine we took the same with Joseph in the praising we saw the Bread and Wine type there so it it has it has followed that was just before uh uh uh the Passover was instituted for the children of Israel but but God kept these things in Shadow he kept it in Shadow why because is a blessing to his church are we together so let's travel a little bit we'll do a little bit of uh uh uh scripture reading we'll try to run through few scriptures we will we will uh read some few things to you before we lost time and uh since since we are doing uh communion this evening we will bring more of communion to you let's let's just let's just work a little bit on uh on Tiding the Bible says we read again uh uh Genesis 14 and the CH the king of s brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Abraham and said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god possessor of uh Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which have delivered delivered thine enemies which have deliver than enemies into thy hand and overcoming you God delivering Abraham from his enemies praise the Lord God giving Abraham a victory in his life amen if we want victory in our life it's not by power it's not by might is by doing what God ordained for us to do amen we walk in the light as he is in the light his blood cleanses us all he want us to do is to just Walk In The Light walk in his word if his word require us to do something do it that's what Jesus said at the feast whatever you know Mary told him whatever he tells you to do do it praise the Lord because you can never tell about you can never tell of that boy whatever he says do it are we together so we see here Genesis 15 God promising Abraham a constant covering and protection constant covering and protection and that he is going to be an exceeding great reward to Abraham he's going to bless him he's going to reward him praise the Lord amen he's going to reward him so we see that uh uh Abraham Abraham uh uh uh you know he went after a fallen brother you know he went after uh uh lot that have backslid you know he went after a fallen brother if we just read a little bit Year from adoption for and and and and and uh Maes now that's Abraham returning now from the slaughter of the king come back praise the Lord on his road back bringing back lot all the people that have been taken like David who went what did David do took his sling Shir and went out and grabbed the little lamb out of the lion's mouth so he's he's showing us a type of redemption David was able to deliver a lamb from a lion and from the the bed it gave him the privilege to be able to stand before a Goliath Amen to deliver isra praise the Lord amen the most important thing that concern the church the most important thing the reason why we are here the thing that God want to do is redemption amen if our purpose of coming year is not red Redemption you have missed the beat right if your purpose of being a Christian is not because of redemption you have missed the mark praise the Lord that that that's that's God's mystery that's the thing that God hid from the foundation of the word that is his Plan of Redemption yes amen God's Plan of Redemption is to bring us in that place that's what Jesus says uh you know uh uh uh your brother offend you you know forgive him 7 Time s and and uh you know if uh if uh uh uh you see it all through the scripture it's all about Redemption you look at the story of Rahab is redemption you look at the story of Tamma it's Redemption it's God bringing his people back is God bringing us back amen praise the Lord he's more interested in redeeming us than destroying us amen that must be our first approach that must be our major effort how much we can put into Redemption how much we can put into bringing a person back to to the knowledge of Jesus Christ than just erasing them and just casting them out and just you know sending them amen as long as birth is in the body of a person never give up from then praise the Lord amen so you see that's God's work and now see here who is this Mac notice after the battle was over ma Exel his Victorious son communion think of that part of himself amen now we want to see here in type here is in view the communion after the battle he gave himself because the Comm meaning is the part of Christ and after the struggle is over after you have done got yourself WEP out then is when you partake of Christ becoming a part of his being amen praise the Lord amen amen when the battle is over then God steps down on on on the on the side look at Jacob when he rise up with the Lord then God gave him a part of himself you no longer be called Jacob you'll be called a prince with God are we together so we see that is the important thing after these things after Abraham has fought to redeem his brother his Fallen brother then God show himself to Abraham because he have just stepped in this in the place of that's the thing that tickles God's heart amen whenever you try to help Humanity help that young man if he's if he's falling sleep whenever you try to help Humanity or you try to help now if you're doing it for political reasons then we have to review that praise the Lord if you doing it to establish yourself then we have to review that amen am amen you're doing it because there's a God that is above us amen that is a god that is above us and you in your mind you are driven uh with the sense that he's a human just like myself amen he's a creature of God and he needs help it tickles God's heart because the fact about the matter there is that God is responsible for every one of us that have breath in our body every living creature on the earth is his responsibility you might have slept on your bed some people slept under the bridge right but he's just F the same respons responsibility like he feel for you yes praise the Lord are we together amen now so we see here we see here I'm I'm trying to bring this in a way that I would not get excited and get off track here so Abraham Abraham did this so the Bible says and we continue to read verse 19 of chapter 14 and he blessed him God blessed him and and and said blessed Abraham after amen after he gave him Bread and Wine which is a type of the communion God is in instituting something fundamental and after he blessed Abraham and uh uh uh verse 20 the Bible says and and and blessed be the most high God which have delivered an enemies into theiry hand and the Bible says and he gave him tithe of all Abraham gave God tithe of all so so there was that that was that was something Supernatural praise the Lord amen that was something Supernatural and the supernatural thing that is in it is that because I'm I'm one of the person that believe that uh uh Tiding is a is a conviction amen amen if it is not a conviction uh uh to you there is not much blessing that is attached to it praise the Lord and we will look into some of those things this morning so it's it's a it's a supernatural thing because here is Abraham here after having this experience praise the Lord amen after having this experience he could he could he could recognize something also and and and then he's giving back he's giving back to this priest he's giving back to meic the 10th of all how did he know that praise the Lord who was his Pastor who preached to him the very thing that hundreds of years later God will establish in the Lord to become a lord to his people but here is say Abraham is doing it just because he's he's he have he has had a supernatural experience who is this man that have just come down to give him Bread and Wine when he's coming after out of a battle he's tired he's hungry in his mind he's thinking who is this man can you just can you just imagine some of the things that might be going through Abraham going through his mind this is where my strength came from praise the Lord because Abraham just a household man he's going against an entire Army he just gathered the people all the boys from his house and said let's go I hear my nephew is in trouble let's go and get him out definitely God the host of the army of God was with him praise the Lord amen I believe that Jehovah n in a supernatural way was standing with Abraham there a national Army will year that a man is coming with his Coke his farmer and what are they bringing HX shovel cut lights the same God has St with David just a slain in his in his in his uh Stone in his slain why did God bless David Stone to hit gol in the face why because David was standing he said how can an uncircumcised Philistine def the army of the Living God so David position was that the name of God would not be dragged down to the he says I rather be dead I rather lay down like a dead man than for the name of God to be dragged down in the M like we would say Over My Dead Body amen amen and because he grew the courage in his heart to defend the name of God God came behind him when he took the the stone Heaven put a force in it Heaven put a force in it that Goliath could not resist all you need all we need to do is just put it in God's hands our hands is so tight we are holding so tight that's why we not getting result let it go and let God take it amen just let it go and let God take it then that's when we get result Abraham realizing that this might be God who is this man I know I'm hungry and I'm tired and right out there the Bible says Abraham turned around and he gave a tenth of all that he had praise the Lord let's go a little bit here Genesis chapter 28 now Genesis chapter 14 that was 422 years when you look at the scripture account that was 422 years before the law will be established about paying time before Moses will come and instruct them that you should pay the tenth of what you have 422 years before that Abraham is paying time let's go ahead Genesis chapter 28 like I said we just look at some few things here amen amen we'll look at some few things Genesis 28 Genesis 28 let's read from verse 19 and he called the name of the place belther that's Jacob by the name of the S was called Lost at the first and Jacob vow a vow saying if God will be with me and he and and will keep me in his way that I go in this way that I go let me go back again my my tongue is knocking to the roof of my mouth and Jacob vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and rmen to put on Amen so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my God Amen and this Stone which I have set for a pillow shall be God's house and of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the 10th I will surely give the 10th unto thee praise the Lord am this is also 153 years before Moses will establish the Lord for Tiding but here is Jacob making a vow to God now so what what I want to bring out of this for us to realize is that it's an unting Lord that God writes in the heart of his children amen amen amen when you come to be saved you are born again you have an experience of a new birth is an UNR Lord that makes you to realize that all you have is God that gave it to [Music] you and you owe him the 10 amen it's anting Lord praise the lord we don't need a police to be going around for that it's anting Lord Lord are we together amen where are we praise the Lord hallelujah you love the Lord amen now so now so we see here just trying to bring trying to bring uh bring this principle up so we can be able to realize it God bringing us into a place he's bringing his children into a place even before the law was established Moses the prophet give them the law The Ten Commandments the statutes and all of that we will come to that but here is God dealing so so you see these things were they were they were in the house when when when the people experienced God's mercy yeah said right there that was when Jacob had that that dream of angels asending ascending and descending when he woke up he says oh wow I never knew that this place was you know a hollow ground and then he's making a promise to God if you will if you will Fe me you will you will you will take care of me I'm I'm traveling I'm getting on this journey amen amen he says I will surely give Thee the 10th I will give unto you the 10th which of course that is the tithe the 10th praise the Lord amen and we stay comfortable amen let's go a little bit further now let's go to Moses Leviticus chapter 27 amen I know I know when you start talking about tith everybody Minds goes to Malachi I might not even read Malachi today so don't uh don't go ahead of me amen amen just just follow me just follow me stay by my side we will we will get there Leviticus chapter 27 I just I just want to read few verses and then I get I might pretty much be out of my time in this evening I will read a few verses on communion before we do the communion and Leviticus chapter 27 you know because sometimes you find people that says oh this thing is uh is uh is uh is is is honor the Lord and uh and we see 422 years before the law was esta Lish Abraham is giving TI to mesc and then uh uh uh Jacob also so Leviticus chapter 27 let's look at verse 30 let me okay let's let's go together let's go together I'm trying to find the best way to to bring this to you amen amen Leviticus chapter 2 7: 30 God is going to show us a very beautiful beautiful pattern here in his word that I want for us to follow together verse 30 says in all the ties of the land whether it be seeds of the land all of the fruits of of the tree is the Lord it is Holy unto the Lord amen amen so tithes is not the first place that is not our is not our money it's God's money amen amen and it belongs to God when we TI in we TI in to God praise the Lord amen now wash wash now this is a very serious Principle as we come to the end of it I I will I will share something with you he says here and if a man will at all redeem out of his TI if he will redeem out of his TI which what does that mean if you will not pay the complete tie you're supposed to pay 10% if you will not pay 10% watch Watch God's principle he says all of his TI he shall add there unto 50 part thereof 20% so it's a beautiful principle praise the Lord amen God don't hold anybody he don't like anybody oing him praise the Lord amen so he says he says that if a man will redeem a partt of his tithe he will now have to pay for that little portion that he have withheld he must add 20% of his wages praise the Lord so if he was if he was uh if he was uh uh paying $10 from the 100 and uh and he does not pay the next time he must pay $30 praise the Lord to replace that one watch this you will see where I'm going with this verse 32 and concerning the tide of the of the hers or of the flocks even whatsoever passes under the rod the 10th shall be holy unto the Lord a beautiful principle here what is the principle is that you don't choose to give God what you want to give God now what is the principle this is the the pathway okay and if the shepherd must pay a tide he washed the sheeps coming in 1 2 3 4 7 8 9 the 10th whatever one it is you don't choose what becomes the 10 amen you can't say oh my this is my best sheep no no let me let me pass let me let me take the 11 no now it's a principle it's a principle and they will go home praise the Lord amen amen you don't choose what you give God now watch and see what what what Moses told him whatever pass at the 10th shall be holy unto the Lord he shall not search whether it be good or bad you it's not for you to tell whether it's good or bad praise the Lord amen if it is the lean one take it it's the 10th give it if it is the best one take it it's the 10th give it he shall not such what it be good or by neither shall he change it and if he change it at all then both it and the change therefore shall be holy it shall not be redeemed so just like on the other side where a person pays 20% when it comes to this one the changing of God is saying the one that you took of and the one you wanted to replace it with All Belongs to the Lord praise the Lord now why am I saying this is because it will have to be a conviction it will have to be a conviction if it is not a conviction we always struggle with him amen are we together and that's the problem within the church that's the problem with the New Testament Church if there is one thing the people struggle with in the church is when it comes to money okay and the next thing that the people struggle or or or try to avoid is when it comes to communion either we do not do it right or we avore it now because these things go back to the foundation of our faith here is God meeting Abraham and giving him Bread and Wine that represent the communion and Abraham in return giv God the 10th of all that represent tith so you see how the both of them is very fundamental to what we claim to believe it's very very fundamental praise the Lorden the truth about the matter there is that H H uh God don't need our physical cash to run the universe he's been running the universe before we were even born praise the Lord you will see it as we go along when you real look at the principle you will you will see we get there you will see that God needs you more than whatever you can offer to him praise the Lord he needs you he want to bring you to that place he want to bring you to that place where is a place of a Son of God or the place of a daughter of God that have a heart that is fully surrounded to God and then we can say like Jesus I'm above the father's business are we together you see because the thing about it there is that you read the scripture the Bible says the aant the for thereof Belongs to the Lord amen everything Belongs to the Lord the breath that we breathe belongs to him everything we have belongs to him praise the Lord so see God in uh in uh in in his uh in in the beauty of the Lord he that holds everything give us everything we have and say of all that I've given you you can survive on night % praise the Lord amen you see the the the Crave in US sometimes h h h is is it overtake us because we still don't believe that you know uh uh what we have we can survive for Faith praise the Lord amen are we together so he gave us everything that we have and uh he says uh uh uh uh you know you can survive of 90% the 10th belongs to me praise the Lord and for you to to survive of the 19 is for you to give me the 10th then I bless the 90 you see the principle amen everything you have I giving it to you even the breath that you breathe the life that you have and and all of this principle goes into our 24 day 24 hours of the day right God give it to you yes you must give him a tithe that's right amen amen amen amen you must give a tide of the 24 hour yes we talk about tide you know our mind just we start counting our our cash no no let's let's look at the principle it's a principle that we are looking at praise the Lord if the principle is established right in honest understand amen if we understand it it will be applied to everything in our Liv we ow God a tenth of our 24 hours to give it to him are we together and I so we see here because that that is that is one of the thing that is that is affecting you know our Our Generation that is La a scripturally Revelation chapter 3 tell tells us this age is Rich the Bible says it's rich and it's increased in Goods but yes this is the age where there is more less done for God than any age praise the Lord amen there is I mean with with all of the inventions that we have just just think about it men roll on on on on herses and chariots and and I mean to to run around and carry the gospel and and think about some of the the ways that some of these disciples travel on ships that were just moving by the wind the seil was carrying it they never had all of these big uh uh engines that are that and and and they stay on the shape for 3 months 6 months 2 years just because they wanted to get to somewhere you know to to to to tell the people about the Lord Jesus and and you know just just to do something for God now with all the inventions that we have this age is doing less less praise the Lord less we we look into that because we don't want to learn we don't want to learn our our our technology is making us think that we are smarter so we want to smart God's principle it does not work like that amen it does not it does not work like that we don't have to come up with something and give you V promises you know let's tell you go what the principle that God laid down in his word say well if you if you want a newest car you got to S your car that you you have out there so a seed to God and let that let that se be your house let that se be your car the SE can be your computer even your wash on your hands what is the principle of for that in God's word what is the principle for death let me show you something as we go along it's not how much we say that makes an impact is how much we give is how much we give how much time do we give to pray how much time do we give to reading God's word studying God's word how much time do we give to being in church how much time do we give out of church it's not how much we save save it's how much we gave praise the Lord amen amen even around the greatest move of God in the age with the ministry of Jesus Christ the power of discernment it's just easy to pick up a s book and start reading get excited understand SE and Seed baptising in Jesus name and then we we have a Ministry we out there praise the Lord Brother brandham said we ordained them and we send them out that principle is far gone from the church why because young men don't want to they don't want to be ordained they don't want to sit down and learn they just pick up they can p c to get up copy and paste copy and paste get excited and then they get out there are we together just so I just like I said it's not how much we have to say is how much do we have to give praise the Lord how much time do we give in understanding what is God doing in my life to just be able to sit down and wash your life PN how much time do we give today we can be able to explain all our stories and explain all the exciting things and and and but yet the the connection the connection one joint of our life brings us to another joint and one experience brings us to another EXP experience it's not how much we can say it's how much we can give praise the Lord are we together amen are we together have I put you to sleep no amen am I sounding so boring this [Music] morning I don't have nothing to preach than what I'm preaching so if I'm standing boring just bear with me praise the Lord are we together amen amen I know I know you I know you enjoy that amen I know you enjoy that let's look at Deuteronomy chapter 12 this will be one of one of my last scripture I we reading and then we'll find we'll find a way to establish this thing and wrap it up for you amen there's a beautiful story that comes out of this I shared that with you some time ago 12 let's let's look at reading from verse 5 reading from verse five but unto the place which the Lord God shall choose shall choose out of all of the tribe to put his name there even unto his habitation shall ye seek and T thou shall come where God has choose to put his name where his presence is dwelling Moses says that's the place you should seek amen verse six and T shall ye bring there you must bring your burnt offering your sacrifice your tithes and uh and having offering of your hands and have offering of your hands and your vows and and your free will offering and and and the first link praise the lord and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hands put your hands unto ye and your household wherein the Lord thy God H hath blessed thee now this this is this is one of the place where most of the time you know it's it's it's almost like it's in our blind spot watch this principle like I said we we trying to just bring principle to you this morning now so God is saying the place where I've choose to put my name and we know that place is in Christ amen it's in Christ that's where he put his name praise the Lord hallelujah that's the reason why water baptism must be done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that's where God put his name the Bible says be baptized in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost Father Son and Holy Ghost is not a name the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost is the name of Jesus Christ are we together so that's the place where God choose to put his name now watch the principle here now Moses is telling them that place where he have chose to put his name the place where where his presence abide amen the place where his presence abide he says that is the place you must bring your offering your tithes what is the significance here the significance to this is that we can offer to the Lord you know we can make offering to the Lord but we must be able to follow God specification or else is not going to be a blessing or El we just doing our own thing praise the Lord amen amen now so the Bible says that place where God has choose to supp his name that's the place you must bring bring your offering your sacrifice and is also the place where you must be able to sit and eat your bread now so the principle comes out where H uh uh uh uh God is more interested in you identifying the place where he put his name he more in uh interested in you being abiding in his presence praise the Lord because you cannot send your offering and you are not in the place God will not receive it amen you can't send your offering there are a lot of people that believe in the principle of Tiding they know that it's a principle God said it in his word so all they want to do is just TI but they don't want to be in his presence they don't want to be in his presence they are not eating in his presence but they want the blessing that comes from the principle of Tiding praise the Lord amen and then sometimes preachers fall for it because this person is sending tithes I told you a story one time where the back back many years ago in in Aros you know uh uh uh uh uh brother Valentin we were there working together and these guys we already knew the the form of life they were in you know it was all of these guys that were scamming people for Big Money big money and uh you know after one service you know brother B called me in the office and I still remember the young man named Victor you know uh uh he uh he brought a very huge amount of money I mean we were Poor Boys those days that money could change our life amen amen huge amount of money if you if you you compare it to the aoran currency that was close to about $55,000 in the bag but I put on the table and say brother one see Temptation he said bro I the time where the ground is dry and the Sun is hot see Temptation praise the Lord amen but we had to take stand on God's word praise the Lord called a young man in the office and and you know we told him well you know no we we won't take this money the beautiful thing that came out of that story was there was one of his boys that was working with him that came to church that Sunday his wife had just gave birth and he came in the office and he told Brother Valentine he says I want you to dedicate my baby he said because what you did on Wednesday night he says you are one in a million he said you know how many pastors just in this community where you are what are they doing they are doing things that is wrong but they want the blessing of Tiding they believe that if they can be able to give tithe God will bless them they want they want that blessing but see the principle that God set right here you have to come to the place where he put his name amen that's where he will receive your Tiding praise the Lord and then you can sit there and then eat of the blessing that's the very same thing he said in Malachi the same thing that Malachi said Malachi was just quoting what Moses said in theonomy when he say I will open the windows of heaven and I will bless you I will rebuke the divor that's why God is saying right here but God cannot do it for you when you just want your money in and you are not in your heart is not in your mind is not in your life is not in Praise the Lord whatever we give when you look at the order that is there is used to take care of the Tabernacle the priest the levite the minister the ministry we can say that there's no Bank bank that we cash it and send it to God in heaven praise the Lord amen so you see it the the principle there is that the principle there it goes back to Redemption he more interested in us that's when it becomes more a blessing praise the Lord amen it does not become h h h you know like like a competition this person p uh 20 i p 50 you know I'm I'm I'm going to be the best I mean we we are not uh you know uh uh uh praise the Lord amen we are not baiting you but that's the principle and that's the reason why it it goes all back to conviction it has to come from a place of birth amen it have to come from a place of birth because if it does not come from a place of birth I debt you with the human nature we will soon hear how much money youve been paid because the day you get mad you you're going to let us know you will tear all right to our face it's not coming from a place of conviction are we together am we'll read this to you Hebrew chapter 6 it got to be something happen by a birth which comes from God and God brings the new birth into you and gave you a part of himself then those things are you are a new creature I gave unto them Eternal eternal life praise the Lord amen it has to be something it was something that Abraham experience praise the Lord and in appreciating MEC he gave him a tenth of everything that he had and then God will brings him into this experience I'm going to be your protector I will be your great and exceeding reward are we together M you see so it's a principle let's take this uh uh other one Hebrews 7 listening to this what will a man take Tiding for if if he never was born referring now to MDC why would he take Tiding F if he was never born and never would die and was from the beginning to the end and never had no father no mother or descent or own the whole Heaven and Earth and all in it why will he take Tiding why will he ask Abraham to pay tith you see what a straight thing it is to pay TI Tiding is very straight it's very straight if you really father the principle is is a very straight thing why because God attached himself to it amen he attached himself to you know when I was when I was studying this early this morning around 5 or so I was thinking about this I know uh you know there there there uh uh some in the church that do uh uh uh direct deposit it and I think there is one country if I if it is not Norway it is either New Zealand or one one of those countries up there that it's a government think it's a government thing if you if you uh if you uh take a job as as uh you know well as as an employer I don't know if they're doing it now but it used to be you know you say you you check out that you are a Christian you have to put the name of your church there and your tie comes directly from your salary straight over to the church the government helps you to pay your ti praise the Lord now you can say that's good but even if you are doing that and there is no conviction you still don't have the blessing praise the Lord you see so the thing is not just you doing it the foundation must be laid am that's that's where I'm getting to this morning I'm not chasing you for your money praise the Lord and even if I chase you I'm not wrong praise the Lord even if I chase you I'm not WR wrong because that's your responsibility amen but but I'm I'm trying to bring us to this place just to show how fundamental these two things are how fundamental they are how fundamental communion is that's the three uh uh uh uh ordinance that was left with the church water baptism communion and foot washing praise the Lord amen amen which of course uh my my little area there for food washing I will have talked about that we are not doing how you can call it is is it pedicure or medic Pedic Pedic no it's not pedicute food washing is not pedicute okay no no no it's not pedicute it's that is it's a time for us it's it's an opportunity that you have to pray for a brother or pray for a sister amen it's not you washing between my toes amen or taking one of my toes and washing it taking the other one and washing it that is not pedicute praise the Lord amen no that's that's not the main thing it is just an opportunity a place of Fellowship where I have the opportunity to get on my knees and take this brother for and pray for him that's what it is that's all the principle that's all the principle am is for you getting on your knees and just praying for a brother taking his foot it's not you washing the nails and and stopping the he and and and and that's not what it's all about you will soon see that Peter thought that what it was that what he wanted for his whole body to be wash but Jesus was not washing people feet in the sense of trying to do uh uh uh what is the thing Pedic no let's let's not because when you miss the principle The Blessing does not follow your action the blessing does not follow how many time you take to wash my toes the blessing follow you praying for me praying for that person that's the purpose praise the Lord amen I may just the same thing with the communion if it was if it was all about us feeling our stomach I mean we would just go to Sister Nami house to eat but it's a bread that is big we lift it before for the Lord we break it into many pieces it's just to take a piece you are just identifying yourself with that ordinance that's the thing that brings the [Music] blessing that is the thing that brings the blessing the church has gone into all sorts of raci and we we we keep hiding and we keep trying to help God I mean you watching somebody Fe you not watching sin of their life there is nothing that would take away sin beside the blood of Jesus Christ amen are we together so he goes on here he says why why why why will he ask Abraham to pay tith you see it is a straight thing it's a straight thing it is to pay tith tithing is right every Christian is Duty B to pay time that's right never has changed it has never changed it came right from our father of faith it will go with all right into the Rapture praise the Lord amen I mean the early church I right after the Resurrection the Ascension of Jesus the early church they went from house to every service they were having communion every service but after a while the church came under persecution the Believers could not meet every every time so they were choosing places to meet to to be able to get away from uh uh uh the Roman government and his sedran Council that was coming after them so every time they meet it says okay let's meet Monday we will meet down by the river we will meet by this place so you realize that they started getting away from every day now it started being particular day and and now it's instituted to the church many Church would do first Sunday but it's it's not only first Sunday there's no way in the Bible say first son the Bible says wherever they met amen praise the Lord amen and uh and and and the ear Church you know I was talking talking to brother VY this morning when I heard he was now well I call him I watched the time it was it was around 3 there in South Africa so I knew they were in between service because they normally have a morning service and an evening service so I call him and he says uh how was the service I said no I'm just about leaving the house he said oh you you have not gone to service yet I told him I says yeah you have two service while we have one which mean after you finish your two service service because time wise they are in their evening time now you know they could finish their evening service before we are even done you know so he said oh wow we finished two service before you have one I said yeah you finished two service before we have one praise the Lord then we were laughing I said something to him I won't say it on on on tape and then we were laughing you know we were laughing together then I told him I says you see uh uh in America we come between the two evenings because communion should be have between the two evenings I think we did that here I brought that to you and uh because many times when people read the scripture and says uh uh uh you know they talk about the evening many people associate the evening with the night that it has to get dark know if you really look at at uh at at the scripture you look at it bringing it from from from exodor over to the New Testament you will realize that there are two evenings amen amen between 3 and 6 so I had to throw that on him a little bit so I told him you know in the states we have communion right between the two evening why are you people there you have morning and evening you understand what I'm saying so and uh uh but that's that's what it is why because it's given to the church is the Lord's Supper it must be done in the evening time not in the night evening is not night it's it's it's different so many times you know uh uh uh we struggle because we we we have been doing it in the night all of our life we come and see it being done in the afternoon oh yeah this is not eving no if you really study the scripture you'll realize it's between two eings three and six praise the Lord any time in between there you you you'll be scriptural and uh where am I you see so it's it's it's just it's just it's just to be able to bring this thing in perspective I could take I could just take tiing and then run with it and uh and even and even share with you a little bit you know of uh of of of how is approach here you know in in our local assembly you know uh uh uh because we we we have learned as we you know as we as we grow in the Lord you know you look through the scripture the Bible says uh uh tiing I I should have that I don't have time to read it but you read Numbers chapter 18 verse 21 20 21 you will see where uh the Bible talks that you know there it it belongs to the Levites now the Levites generally is the ministry is the ministry that's the way we approach it here is the ministry we we we take Tidings to the ministry in a sense that you know we are able to to uh uh uh pay our pastor we are able to toh compensate our ministers we are able to uh take care of our visitors that comes in we try the best that we can you see because if you look at it in every way the entire subject has been has been abused on both ends praise the Lord the people abuse it when they don't do it right the ministers also abuse it you know when they think that uh It All Belongs to them and they can do anything with it no it must be something that is directed towards the ministry are we together now so uh uh and you know it goes It goes as I was as I was telling this also I had this on my mind thank God that he reminded me you know so let let me just go right there so you know that's that is the way we do it why because if you if you read the same Leviticus 18 verse 25 and 26 I think either 20 21 or 25 26 the Bible will tells you where the Levites had to pay the tithe of the tithe so whatever comes in as a tith to the church the the the tide a 10% is taken from there and is you know it's it's a tide of the tide now that also is also used uh that's what we use because it's for the ministry that's what we use to take care of our visitors and and all of that and I will be I will be I will be very very grateful you know very grateful and very very proud of our assembly praise the Lord very grateful and very proud of our assembly by God's grace the Lord has helped us you know uh uh uh I mean sometimes with all the visitors that comes through here sometimes there is too much for the kind of a church that we are in the sense that we are a small church but yet by God's grace we able to take care of them praise the Lord amen we are able to take care of them that mean some comes and they don't even come and preach for us but yet we uh we feel their responsibility you know uh that uh uh you know we we we we must take care of them praise the Lord amen I tell you I was I was on the field for many years I travel so I know what traveling preachers goes through praise the Lord I travel and uh it was it was not a word of life for me but it was I mean Word of Life in a sense that were were my you know f i depend on it no you know because I was I was in some way you know uh but it is our responsibility and the thing about it there also you know you you you look at uh you know the the the uh the contribution made to the church is not only TI uh we also have offering but you will find it is General it's that own it with our assembly is generated most everywhere you know because of the blessing of Tiding we are more you know disciplined to paying our ties than than than being generous to make offering that's just that's just a general thing that happens everywhere you know we become more disciplined because we know that the Bible was specific on you know 10% for Tiding the Bible was not specific on offering it's a free will offering praise the Lord so you will find in most places where uh uh uh sometimes the church have more tithe and they have more offering so you see because Tiding is for the ministry so uh uh uh sometimes the ministry is able to cover you know some of the expenses that belongs to the ministry then putting pressure on the people praise the Lord amen amen you will see where also sometimes you know it looks like uh uh a cash trick and says well you know uh the the song leader start the service and then uh I mean right right away he takes up the offering why why now we wait until all the people come when the people come at the end of the service then we take up the offering it looks like a cash trap but it's not it's not the way it's supposed to be if it's supposed to be at the time he does it that is the time he's supposed to do it praise the Lord amen amen that's the time he's supposed to do it God is responsible for his people God is responsible for his church amen amen and as long as God has kept this local assembly yet and keep these doors open God will raise up people to take care of this work praise the lord we can only invite you to be a part amen amen but I mean we can force you you just if you grab the vision of what what we are doing and you want to be a part blessed be the name of the Lord now so you see it and and and even as I was as I was looking at that what I didn't want to to leave from my mind is that we have a h a responsibility even as parents you know because what is happening there is that as parents we we we take the place of uh you know you know I'm the one working you know I'm the one that's supposed to to to tithe you know and you know and and you have the money but what you are not doing is that you are not teaching your children to give so you might have an entire generation that is that is growing and don't know how to give because they are not working where do they get money from to give where do they get money from to pay offering they are not working but you see we supposed to teach them and how do we teach them by giving them money to give so the child grows up with that and then when it reach at the age of where the supposed to know because if if they don't have the privilege to be taught they will never learn it are we together so you see I mean just like I said it's uh it's it's it's a generation where less is being done for the Lord amen L is been done for the Lord and and I mean and all of that but where are we getting to today Genesis chapter 15 let's read that one more time and on the basis of that we will call heart to the morning service and start to prepare ourself for communion this evening praise the Lord amen he all by himself I am that shade if God's your shade how's the devil going to hit you amen see I am your shade and your exceeding great reward who is I am the Lord your exceeding great reward if God is your protector how can the devil hit you amen because he's protecting you Genesis chapter 15 let's read that one verse together again and then we will bring this to a close for this morning and we look forward to how the Lord will lead us this evening praise the Lord amen you know as we as we as we will prepare ourself this evening the the the like that's the reason why you hear me constantly saying we have a prayer meeting because that's what the communion should all should be all about the communion service should really be a prayer service every aspect of it should be a prayer service it's not only when we pray for one another but every aspect of faith amen every aspect of fath I mean when you if you if you take an attitude of being in the communion service and you are judging people when they are coming up for the communion you are putting yourself in the seat of discomfort praise the Lord amen if you know that the person is uh is is is doing something that you think they're not supposed to do pull them aside after the service it must not even be after the service find another time you see that is the maurity that the church has not grown to why because well it's the pastor work is the Deacon work but yet it's our work to talk Amen to talk to criticize that's our work the courage to be able to sit with a brother or sit with a sister to even says well brother it's been a long time I've not seen you what's going on because people go through things praise the Lord people go through things that's not our place it's not your place at all whether the person is qualified to take the communion the person is that's not your place if you have a question in your mind or your heart your position is Lord bless my brother as he's going to that communion table I I'll tell you some things that happened right in this assembly a person was struggling with something in their life that was was a sickness an illness and I called them to the office and talked to them and they were not even sure they wanted to be part of the communion that night and I told him I say sir I want to I want for us to go to that communion table tonight believing that that's where it's going to stop and miraculously God healed the person that's what a pray that's what a communion service is all about it's a prayer meeting we come we put our heart before the Lord we pray for one another because we want the blessing of the ordinance it's not to show who spiritual and who not spiritual definitely if we know that a man is is not living right he's running around with with girls and you know and living a disgraceful life you know well definitely we will we will not is it's just not uh something that we no no we definitely will not allow it if a person is doing something is known to the assembly you know definitely it's the Deacon's responsibility to pull that person off call them to the office talk to them and says no I think it should not be praise the Lord but sometimes visitors come in that Miss they don't know any different praise the Lord if I hold that bread in my hands here then the person is coming and I think they don't know no different every moment I stands here I pray for everybody that walks to this table that's what I'm supposed to do praise the Lord amen now if we are sitting the round truth and just like I said I mean if you have something in your life to make right make it right get on your knees confess it to God ask God to deliver you from it if you are not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus what's stopping you from being baptized praise the Lord amen when over there the last time you know uh uh uh I mean uh uh uh that's that's our our responsibility as parents we have to prepare our children just like like you follow their natural growth and you are you are concerned of things in their life at a certain age that's the same way as a parent you have to follow their spiritual growth you have to talk to them how is God dealing with them in your heart you find uh most of the time we have uh uh a baptism you find a child com and say I myself too I want to be baptized if your child is saying that set them down and talk talk to them talk to them find out what why they want to be baptized the only baptism that is not scripture is infant baptism we cannot baptize Olivia but any child that is showing a good conscience towards God we are having little children that have better conscience towards God and groom up men and women right their spirit is innocent pray let God get them at that time now when they are going through teenage struggle pray let God get them at a young age amen musicians you can come if you have to leave ell we'll be back this evening by 400 p.m. let's bow our heads [Music] together this is your house thank
