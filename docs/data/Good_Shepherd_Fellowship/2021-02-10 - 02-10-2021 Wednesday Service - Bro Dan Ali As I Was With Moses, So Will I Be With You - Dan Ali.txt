god that you have heard and answered our prayers [Music] amen shall we be seated since god bless you musicians [Music] praise be to god you all warmly welcome once again to the house of god as i was seated in the pastor's office and i was thinking just trying to gather myself together a thought just came running through my mind and i said you can never prepare enough it's like if you are given the chance to prepare you always ask for extension of time yeah and i thought just came to my mind uh you may think all soldiers are brave it's not the case and some paratroopers when they are in the air especially when they are training and they are in the air and they are pushing them out it's not easy because they look at the distance probably 20 30 000 feet in the air and they are just trusting that the parachute will deploy and they jump out of the plane and they pull the pin or whatever it is and then the parachute deploys and then they find themselves floating in the air so that is where i find myself tonight praise the lord we are jumping anyhow believing that god will deploy the parachute praise me to god and remember we are jumping together amen so a lot of things were on my mind um last sunday i last two weeks sunday and i was just wondering just going back and forth but as the lord would have it tonight we'll be looking at a sermon the prophet preached and he titled it as i was with moses so will i be with you praise be to god shall we please stand for the original scripture turn with me to joshua 1. joshua 1 we are reading from 1 to 5. now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord speak unto joshua the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all these people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall trade upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of their life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee if we can either save us be strong and of good courage for unto these people shall i divide all the an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them praise be to god may the lord add his blessings to the religion of his word shall we be seated as i was with moses so will i be with you now i want us to look at moses a little from birth the life of moses was in the hands of god right from birth and his mother knew that the life of moses was in the hands of god she knew that moses was born a deliverer that was why she could death pharaoh because there was a law that was passed and a male born should be killed and she went and put the baby on the nile because she knew that the life of that baby was in the hands of god praise be to god and no matter what was going to happen she knew that god was going to take care of moses and for us believers i want us to know that our lives are in the hands of god right from breath sometimes you grow and your mother will tell you oh when i was pregnant with you i almost miscarried but by the grace of god what was god doing god was protecting his gift sometimes i would tell you oh i had to bed rest for six months because of you what was god doing god protecting his gift you know sometimes you see people grow and then they wish that oh i should have been born in this family why are my parents poor why are they this why are they not educated why are they this why are they that but you forget that they have to sacrifice everything for you it is better to be born by a poor wretched parent who will teach you the will of god than to be burned by the richest man on earth who will tell you that oh once upon a time you were a monkey you developed into an earth and you became a human being teaching you about evolution is better to be a child of god to be told the way of god than to seek the riches of this world the hand of god was upon moses right from his infancy and we know the story how moses ended up in pharaoh's house the man that had passed the law god brought his gift right under his nostrils and he had to take care of that gift praise be to god now just look at it all the education moses had all the training he had could never prepare him for the assignment god had for him his mother had told him that he was the deliverer that god was going to use him to deliver the children of israel from bondage and he grew up with it and in his heart he was not looking at the beautiful things in egypt he was not looking at the throne he was not looking at the benefits he was looking at the promises of god sometimes for the love of god you have to turn down a lot of things and people will look at you and think you are out of your mind of course you have to be out of your mind to gain the mind of christ praise be to god but you look at you know he was getting his influence from a different dimension he was not looking at the beautiful things around his heart was set on heavenly things moses growing up he had in him he knew that he was a deliverer but he went about it the wrong way when he killed that egyptian all his years of education could not get him to do what god wanted him to do he did it the way he thought was the best you don't serve god the way you think you serve god according to the will of god if it is anything less than what the world requires god is dishonored in that i don't care how good it is praise be to god now we know the story how moses ran and he found himself in median now at this point to moses it was all over he found himself a wife married got settled and i don't think moses planned to ever go back to egypt he was comfortable with life in media he would just get up in the morning just take his rod and the ship go before him and he's behind them all day when the sun was shining the sun shone on him when it was raining the sun rain that came on the ship came on him he was just out there and i wonder what was going in moses mind because at this point he may have been thinking but my mummy told me that i was the deliverer was mommy lying to me probably my mom was lying to me the deliverer to lead the people of god out of bondage and here i find myself following sheep in the wilderness and sometimes he may have thought would it have been better if i inherited the throne and became the next pharaoh and then allowed the people to go was that the right way probably that was the way god wanted me to go and he may have thought a lot of thoughts came to him as he was just roaming with a sheep going out and coming in every single day now when you look at the name of his son eliasa the meaning of that name it tells you of a man that had given up praise be to god eliasa means the god of my father says he is my helper and has delivered me from the sword of pharaoh now with my limited english knowledge if you are telling me that he says he's my helper i think it is different from saying he is my helper so at this point it was painting a picture of somebody that was disappointed and moses kind of felt that oh i have let god down he never saw his way back i don't know how many of you have ever been there but i have walked those corridors that you got to a point in your life and you know deep down your soul that you have let god down that you have turned your back on god and you look behind you and there is no way of ever tracing your steps back to the altar of god and you feel so condemned and the devil capitalizes on it and he would hammer you down day and night if god does not help you you wouldn't know when you put the ropes around your neck moses had given up but one day he got up and it was meant to be one of those days one of those normal days and then he took his sheep and while they were out there he saw that the bush was on fire and yet it was not burning and that caught his attention at this point he didn't hear anything it was when he turned to look at it because it was a strange sight that he had moses moses and moses could identify himself with that voice praise be to god this was the first time moses was hearing the voice of god and you think moses could identify himself with that voice how possible is it that sounds like an irony praise be to god this reminds me of the story about the eagle when he enter picked the egg of that eagle and gave it to a hand to hatch and the hand hide that eagle and it was just in the hand coupe there with the other with the brothers and sisters just scratching the floor looking for food here and there he may have looked different from the others because the mouth was different the big the feathers the brothers may have looked at it so weird but how does this brother look like this and what have you but one day mama eagle was in the air just going around and the mama eagle saw the baby eagle and then she screamed that was the first time that the baby eagle would hear the voice of the mother but that baby ego could identify itself with that voice praise be to god and when he turned to look and she screamed back he said yes i am your mommy i have been looking for you all this while he said mommy so i don't belong here she said no you don't belong here you belong to the skies they say mommy if it's you build me to come mommy says come over praise be to god and the baby iggy just flopped his wings and just hit the fence and came down oh just right and mommy eagle realized that oh it is not your time but she knew what bit where the baby eagle was and she just flew away oh something happened there was a revival going on in the soul of that baby eagle because that baby had a voice their brothers and sisters were dead they didn't know what was going on when a deep cross there is a deep to answer praise be to god oh there was a revival going on in the hell group and i see the baby eagle running from left to right just jumping up and down because there was something going on and then the brothers and sisters who look at it so weird what is going on with this guy it looks like he's getting out of his mind probably it needs a physician oh yeah we need to help him we need to carry him to see the psychologists praise be to god but the baby eager would not have any of that because it knew what was going on and another time mama eager comes around and when mama eagle screamed the baby eagle looked and screamed also mama you said come and flop your wings the baby flopped his wings i was just going up mama you said come on come with me and then they weren't flying in the skies and i can imagine the baby telling mama oh mama oh we are going too high i'm afraid mama said just come over don't be afraid i'm with you you belong to the skies and then they went but just remember that it was when the baby eagle turned time to see the voice that was when things changed so you asked me how moses could identify himself with that voice i don't know how but i believe with all my heart it's like the first time you heard god speaking to you deep down in your soul you knew it and nobody could talk you out of it you could identify yourself with that voice praise be to god and when moses stand and god spoke to him i wouldn't want to go into all that and now just fast forward all the drama as i was with moses so will i be with you now moses finds himself in egypt god told moses that you have become a god to pharaoh and aaron is your prophet the man moses even though an ordinary human being he was not ordinary god took that man moses god sat into that man moses he used his hands his feet to glorify himself when he called moses he said i have heard the cry of my people and i have come down to deliver them it was not moses it was god in moses now all the miracles moses calling place upon plagues placed upon plagues turning the rivers into into blood calling frogs grass i mean all just miracles until finally the first bones of both human including pharaoh's first son and animal had to die and then they couldn't take it anymore and at this point pharaoh had gotten enough can a man fight god and win it is only a foolish dog that would see a lion and run after it a wise dog would choose his fight wisely it knows where to venture and where not to venture pharaoh had gotten enough and then he let the children go now when they got before the red sea god had in pharaoh's hearts and he took his army and they ran after the children of israel to bring them back and to subject them again to punishment now when the children of israel saw the army of egypt the egyptian army coming and they could see the dust below it in the air and the straw started crying and shouting and complaining when moses turned and looked at them he had already passed judgment on the people he said these people you see you would never see them again and god was waiting on moses to take an action and moses was waiting on god now remember at this point moses had used that road in his hands several times brother branham said that road in moses hand was god's judgment road so when moses declared that these people you see you will never see them again i believe at that point if he has straight down road and called for fire fire was going to come down but he stood and god told moses why are you crying unto me why are you crying unto me moses is that not a rod in your hand turn and stretch it towards the sea and divide the sea and when he turned and stretched it he divided the sea praise be to god and the children of israel walked on dry ground and their enemy perceiving them god consumed in the midst of the sea when he strayed the road again and the sea just came back remember we are talking about as i was with moses so will i be with you i'm skipping a lot of things because i want to make it as short as possible and to cover enough grounds praise be to god as i was with moses now god was with the man moses so much that even when his own sister didn't speak right about the prophet god came down in the pillar of cloud god was not happy with miriam and aeron and god said if there is any prophet amongst you i the lord will make myself known unto him in dreams and will speak to him in visions but as for my servant moses it is not so i speak to him live to live praise be to god and god struck him with leprosy struck her with leprosy and when aaron saw it because iran was part of it he was so scared and moses had to pray for miriam upon all that they had to keep her away for seven days god was so much with moses and god so much vindicated his prophet when deaton kora and abiram conspired against the prophet of god what happened the grand opening of swallow them there together with their families even the 250 men who offered sacrifice who were of their company fire came down and consumed them that even when god was displeased with the children of israel and he came down to consume them moses stood in the gap and he told god do not do it if you do it the egyptians are going to laugh at us they will say you brought us out of egypt you couldn't get us to the homeland and god had to listen praise be to god that was how close moses was to god god on two feet now but i want us to look at something here never get complacent in your work with god complacency i try to look out the definition of the word complacency and what i picked is a feeling of satisfaction that comes from your achievement so you can look at how far you have come with god where he picked you from and why he has brought you and then you allow things into your life which you shouldn't allow you get complacent moses who on earth would think that a man like moses would do something and god will be displeased with it when the children of israel needed water to drink and moses spoke to god spoke to moses to go and speak to the rock that the rock may bring forth its water for them to drink they're together with their beasts moses took iran and the elders of israel and when they got to the rock instead of speaking to the rock moses smote the rock and then smote it again brother branham said that moses striking the rock twice through the picture of god the whole picture threw it out of order it was a serious thing because the rock that followed them was christ and he was so much he was he was smitten once and for moses to strike and strike again the second time was breaking scripture and god was not happy with moses and god said moses because of this thing you have done you will see the promised land but you are not going to go in there i don't care how far god has brought you i don't care if you speak and fire comes out from heaven never let complacency get in your way with god was it king of zia at the age of 16 who became the king of judah and he found favor so much in the sight of god and he went to the temple one day to go and burn incense that was not his office god was displeased with him and god struck him with leprosy do not let complacency get in your way with god that is a dangerous thing to do moses saw the promised land and moses did not enter so at this point god talks to joshua if we can just go back to that scripture again just show one joshua went seven only be thou strong and very courageous that thy mayors observed to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whether so ever thou goes this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate there in day and night that that mayors do that that may have observed to do according to all that is written during for them thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success have i not commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee with us so ever thou goes praise be to god god telling moses god telling joshua do not turn to the left do not turn to the right walk in the statues walk according to the law what you have been told do not deviate from the word full obedience to the word of god is what brings the victory obedience is better than sacrifice there is no way you can prosper in the things of god when you disrespect the word the word is the absolute and god told joshua not to depart from the word and joshua caught it he knew that to be successful he had to put the word first to be victorious he had to put the word first to please god he had to put the white first and god brings joshua and the church of israel to the jordan brother branham said the river jordan was three four times its normal size it was full flew in his banks and god told joshua in three days you guys are crossing over brother brother said that god was testing joshua he was testing him to see whether he was a real joshua he knew and joshua told the people that god said in three days we are going over and in three days we are going over how the people may have looked at him and wondered what was wrong with him they may have suggested to him why don't we wait till the waters recede in the dry season so we can just walk across it is not what you think it's what god wants them praise be to god and joshua told them god said in three days we are going over and in three days we are going over and look at what joshua does god commanded him to stay with the world and what he does he puts the word first the ark of the covenant the ark of the covenant went first and you commanded them go ahead now the children may have heard the story being told that when they got before the red sea the waters parted and they walked through and i hear joshua is telling them with all the water overflowing the banks joshua said come on go ahead and they were wondering what is going on but they believed god was with him and when joshua commanded the priests who were bearing the act to go forward they went forward and as soon as their feet tied the walls of jordan the waters parted praise be to god and they walked through and when they got to the other side of jordan and the enemies heard of what the lord had done there was no man left in the camp anymore praise be to god as i was with moses so will i be with you and now the people saw that yes the god of moses was in the camp now they go ahead they go to jericho goddess christ his father what to do and they just did it according to the word it is the word that brings the victory following the leadership of the word brings the victory don't try to fine-tune it you can't fine-tune the word of god it may not make sense to you it doesn't have to make sense to you if it makes sense to you where lies the faith praise be to god and we know the story how the words of jericho came down as i was with moses so will i be with you and now when the opportunity came and the prophet of god did a time to finish a battle he spoke to the sun spoke to the moon something that had never happened before and god had to listen as i was with moses now in this day and in our age god also sent us a prophet i will not read everything i have here but i think i can take this first page brother brad i'm speaking now when god gave me my commission i have based all this back for this one purpose gifts and calling are without repentance no man can make himself anything god makes you what you are by his grace we have no way of making ourselves jesus said who taking thought can add one cubit to his toucher who can make himself bigger or littler than you know by taking thought you can't do it when god gave the commission i questioned it i said i'm insufficient i have no education i cannot do this. it is not what you can do it is not your strength its what god is willing to do in your life it is not your education education is good those of you that are in school when you go to school study and study hard if there is anybody in school who is the best it should be one of you here give it your all when you are in class pay attention give it your all but education does not help men to know god education can only help you to read it doesn't even help you to understand the word you would think that some of the most educated men we have probably should be those that get so close to god but there are those that are farther away from god there are people as we speak they are sitting on the moon and they see the mystery of god more than we do they are seeing the heavenly this and you would think that that would give them some fear to know that yes it's true that there is a god who created this thing and some of these people are those that are propounding those theories that human beings evolve from apes or is it monkeys i don't know yet praise be to god the prophet did not have any good education we know we know about the birth of the prophet the mystery surrounding his breath um let me just cover a little ground here so we can go into some of these things and many of you people here this morning are still living here today when he appeared down here on the river in that form of the pillar of fire and stood there and spoke back and said as john the baptist was sent forth for a forerunner of the first coming of christ so will your message be the forerunning of the second coming look was done that light hanging over there it entered the paper it went all the way across the united states and into other nations talks about dr lee lee level um there was in canada at the time he remembers when it appeared in the canadian paper i believe it was wasn't it i spoke to the brother now let's just take a step down but one day god decided to stop the mouth of the unbelievers because he stayed with the word the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel is just the same today leading the church spiritual is the same as it led the natural it appeared again and they took the pictures before the critics and before the examiners here it hangs now infallible infallibly the truth doing the same works leading a people spiritually as it led them naturally back there staying with the word praise be to god i charge you before god and the elect angels and jesus christ the commission was pray for the sick the question was insufficient to do it for this course you were born this is the means of your peculiar breath and life that you are to pray for the sick if you will get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even a cancer how many has read that through the years is all over the world praise be to god he said as moses was given two signs to vindicate his commission so uh so are you you are given two signs one of them will be your hand the other one will be you will know the very secret of their heart and thoughts of their mind and by this they will believe by these signs now remember listen don't you fail to get this the sign is not the commission the sign only points to the commission praise be to god i have another page i wouldn't go into that i'll be running up very soon we know about the peculiar breath of the prophet how that during his birth that light came into the room and again at his age seven and how did the pillar of fire god coming down to vindicate the ministry of his servant the prophet and allowing the cameras to capture it praise be to god that god was with him as he was with moses god was with the prophet god worked with him in fact i cannot think of any healing ministry that comes so close to the healing ministry that brother branham heard nothing compares to it god uses so much that he could tell the secret of man's heart praise be to god but look at it the prophet did not have an easy life look at the family his family background from a very poor background look at his father spoke of his father being a drunk never hate that how life was so difficult look at the home why he was raised up in a prophet of god with that humble humble background i don't know what you may be going through the things you are going through do not define who you are and to think of the prophet of god losing his wife his first wife and his baby all together i mean it it blows your mind sometimes we are start life to be rosy to be comfortable that we want this we got it we want that we get it and by that we think that oh god is with us no it is not always like that and the pillar of fire that you see hanging over the prophet when god took his prophet away he didn't take that pillar of fire away wherever this message of america foregoes that pillar of fire goes to vindicate it and as we sit here tonight the pillar of fire is here the bible says that one two or three i gotta remind them there i am in their midst god is here tonight god is here tonight his wife says i will never leave you nor forsake you i will be with you alway and as i was with moses so will i be with you god was with moses god was with joshua god was with the prophet and god is with you tonight do not look at the storms look at the promises of god i will never leave you not forsake you the pillar of fire is here to vindicate the ministry of the lord jesus christ it was not brother branham's message he came to reveal christ to point the bride to christ be to god i don't care what it is that people say about random i don't give a damn about that the most important thing is that his message has changed my life praise be to god oh something just kicked in i remember brother brother once saying something was it last last two weeks i'm not quoting him verb at him in other words i'm not quoting him what word he just dropped in because he says something like what will be the importance of the god of rhetoric after all that the or after all that god did in his life all the miracles the wonders and that god cannot change his life what is the use he says something like that it is not about brother browner he came he has done his part he is gone what are you doing the ball is in your cut now what are you doing with the weight what are you doing with the word remember that the god we serve is a no-nonsense god there is some blood on the mercy seat when the blood leaves that mercy seat that same seat becomes a judgment seat and while there is some mercy let's reach out let's keep crying out to god because god hears the cry of his children and at the appointed time god will show forth do not take the things of god for granted it's just the grace of god that is keeping us but some of us can look at our lives and then see what we have done in our lives and we know that if it hadn't been for the grace of god will not be living he would have struck us dead but grace came our way and while grace still lasts make good use of it make goodness of it as i was with moses so will i be with you so remember that you are not alone in this journey when the going gets tough remember that you have a god that is with you and that you are not alone when sickness comes remember that god is there with you when troubles come remember that god is there with you when the stops are coming remember that god is there with you when you are surrounded by the enemy on every side remember that god is there with you and who can fight against god and win our lives are in the hands of god and our lives are altered by god from the cradle all through life nothing takes god by surprise praise be to god as i was with moses this is a very good place to bring the kitchen down so if you don't take anything from tonight's service remember that god has not called you only to sit on your fence and then look at you struggle by yourself because he knows that you can't do it so remember that you are in the hands of god wherever you find yourself remember that god is there be conscious of the presence of god the reason why sometimes we do this we shouldn't do is that we lack that consciousness but if you are conscious that the god you are serving is with you you are careful the things you do you are careful you are careful the words that come out of your mouth you are careful the places you go you are careful that is you do because you are conscious of the presence of god and remember that he would never leave us and he would never forsake us he is in the camp he is in the camp praise be to god the musicians can come over are serving a living god and if it hadn't been for the grace of god will not be here if you look at all that is happening and we are still alive we are so strong we are healthy it's not because we know how to take care of ourselves if you ever got admitted to the hospital and then you came back home just think about it that somebody ever slept on that bed and never went back home you drive on a particular road in and out every day somebody drove down that road and never came back year in year out the grace of god has never left us as i was with moses so will i be with you god bless you saints and let's just say a word of prayer our lord and our savior jesus we thank this so much oh god for how far you have brought us tonight father you know the niece in the lives of your children and i believe dear lord jesus that tonight's message was tailored to meet the niece in the lives of your sons and daughters oh god [Music] for we know that you speak and we know that when we speak you hear us we know that you are in the camp because your word says so you are a covenant keeping god you are faithful who have promised that you would never leave us not forsake us but would be with us always what a wonderful gracious father you are we give you the glory tonight father we praise thee we worship and we bless you for everything you've done for us tonight we couldn't have asked for anything more we thank you lord we are in your hands lord come and have your way and let your will be done under any circumstances in jesus name father we pray hey right away [Music] is it's the god in the night oh the god of the mountain it's a god in the when thing goes wrong we make them right [Music] god [Music] we want to thank the lord for the word tonight praise the lord amen praise the lord thank you jesus amen you know brother branham said in that message but dan was reading from tonight and he spoke spoke from you know the lord gave brother branham that that message as i was with moses and talking about the two phases of his ministry and one of the things that the law was dealing with brother branham on was the the fear of failure praise the lord can you imagine the prophet of god like brother dan was saying all of the things that god did in his ministry giving him a sign in his hands i mean he can touch people and there will be a vibration right here on his hands and he will be able to know [Music] diseases he got to a place in his ministry what he was afraid to feel praise the lord and it's kind of amazing because we read the book of ezekiel this morning and as i was driving to work i was thinking about the ministry of precision [Music] how god has been precise right from the beginning you know that was just on my mind this morning as i was driving to work talking about measurements you know uh and and and different things uh i got a little story i'll share with you and if i had the time to talk on that but uh it's very amazing you know i that kind of caught my mind i went i went somewhere and i was uh i was looking at a uh a trouser and i took the trouser and i put it around my neck you know and and the gentleman was looking at me you know asking what am i doing i was trying to see if you know if it's going to fit me and he was just looking at me i said no i just want to make sure if he can get around my waist you know he says i've never seen people do that i said oh yeah if you can get around your neck you can get around your waist is it real you know and then when i was left from there i started thinking about measurements i started thinking about the different measurements you know of the act of the covenant and the different measurements through the scripture but we were talking about that if the lord gave us grace but just think about that you know brother branham goes to a place in his ministry where he i mean just that sense of failure that sense of being afraid to fail you know was haunting him you know and and every time he wanted the law to show him a vision you know uh you know he wanted to go on a vision he wanted to pray on the vision he wanted to you know and the lord was telling him as i was with moses so will i be with you you know if i didn't feel you in the first phase of the ministry i'm not going to fail you now amen and if god has kept us still now he's able to keep us into a rapture amen he's able to keep us into a body change praise the lord if we just keep that word before us on my way to service tonight i taught about that song i share with you one time it's an old song that a la fountain sang about family resemblance i just i just uh wrote the chorus i couldn't get the rest of the sensor but i would like for us to just try that tonight you look just like your father and [Music] i was thinking about the uh that eagle story brother dan share with us tonight we know that uh you know brother branham shared that you are looking more like your father every day let's let's stand on our feet we'll learn it together uh we have not signed it yet before so uh uh we will see if we will go flat or we will go high praise the lord but i think it was a good message for the prayer meeting for us to be able to trust the lord amen he promised that he will never fail us and that's the chorus of the son you are looking more like your father every day [Music] there's a family resemblance on your face i can see it in the way i can hear it in the things you see you are looking more like your father every day family [Music] there's so yes oh yes so so hello [Music] amen praise the lord the lord bless you we'll see you on sunday and he keep each and every one of us i think the temperature will be dropping tonight i never saw that until late this evening when i got a text so let's drive safely and go home in the peace of the lord amen let's sing that chorus you are looking more like a fiber [Music] i can't you are looking more like your father every you are looking more like hello living you are looking more like your father every day yes [Music] like the father every day [Music] you
