[50:02] the power all that God has given to us
[50:07] is here in this morning uh giv to us
[50:11] year in this morning and the great thing
[50:15] that we have

[50:27] the abomination of Minneapolis see there
[50:31] you are he only Mark those kind making
[50:36] that comparison of e of Ezekiel chapter
[50:40] 9 when the angel went through the city
[50:43] marking those that sight and cry for the
[50:47] city and uh and and this is our city
[50:51] praise the Lord this is our city we all
[50:54] knows uh uh a couple of things we
[50:56] experienced few years ago with all the
[50:59] riots and all of that thank God we don't
[51:01] have that but yet uh with with the
[51:04] increased uh crime rapes around the
[51:07] country Minneapolis is not less this is
[51:10] our
[51:11] city it's uh is uh we don't have to wait
[51:15] for things to come to uh to the footstep
[51:17] of our doors before we know that these
[51:20] things are reality many of us know yet
[51:24] on the news of uh uh uh uh what happened
[51:27] there in in Houston Texas with uh
[51:30] shooting over there in uh uh uh you know
[51:34] that uh Jo Austin group and all of that
[51:38] you know uh uh and and I mean that's
[51:41] that's the time that we are living in
[51:44] there is not a day that go by without a
[51:47] gun shooting there is not a day that
[51:50] goes by without violence in the
[51:54] city and and as Sons and Daughters of
[51:57] God that is our responsibility we must
[51:59] not only think about our children think
[52:02] about our family you know think about
[52:04] the Saints in church that's wonderful
[52:06] that's our responsibility we all one
[52:08] another there but let's side and cry for
[52:12] the Abomination that is done in this
[52:14] city amen praise the
[52:17] Lord and uh so there that is that's my
[52:21] take from the Sunday school tipe that
[52:24] was played this morning
[52:26] and uh we we want to go back to our our
[52:31] our series we've been talking about uh
[52:34] since the beginning of the year the
[52:37] beginning the beginning has been a
[52:40] series that we've been talking about we
[52:42] on our our six beginning uh the elected
[52:46] lady we have one more beginning uh to be
[52:49] able to close the entire beginning
[52:51] series we took seven beginning from from
[52:55] June John uh uh St John writing not his
[52:59] gospel but uh the three other chapters
[53:02] that he wrote to the church the church
[53:05] of Ephesus and to many of the other
[53:07] churches that benefited from that
[53:09] writing we we got this inspiration
[53:13] talking about how John was affected he
[53:16] was affected by the vision that he saw
[53:19] on the island of pmos it affected him in
[53:23] so much that uh
[53:25] uh when he uh came from the island of
[53:28] pmos he started to see things in sants
[53:32] with all the Sant that he saw on the
[53:34] island of pmos seven Church ages seven
[53:38] Angel seven messenger and and and all of
[53:42] those things affected him that he
[53:44] started to see things in servants and
[53:47] and if you get that in your head and
[53:49] you're reading John gospel you can't
[53:51] help but you you you will see a lot of
[53:54] things that John just put in servants
[53:57] there are many you could bring out but
[53:59] he was so affected by the pattern that
[54:01] he saw on the Isen of pmos so so that's
[54:05] the reason why we choose to bring out
[54:07] these seven Beginnings that he mentioned
[54:10] in first John second John and third John
[54:13] so we took second John and where he
[54:16] talks about the elect lady the elected
[54:19] lady and we title it the elected lady
[54:22] from the beginning because when John
[54:25] saw uh uh uh Revelation chapter 19 and
[54:30] uh it was it was said
[54:32] behold uh uh you know uh uh uh the
[54:36] marriage of the Lamb has come and the
[54:39] bride has made herself ready after that
[54:42] experience John couldn't help but uh
[54:44] realized that uh uh this lady that is
[54:48] the bride that had made herself ready
[54:51] came started all the way from
[54:54] Genesis
[54:55] she started all the way from Genesis
[54:58] making herself ready are we together now
[55:02] so uh uh that's that's what we we've
[55:05] been we've been talking about and uh
[55:09] uh
[55:11] uh and we want to continue in that light
[55:14] so let's just stand on our feet we're
[55:16] going to start right right there then uh
[55:19] the elected lady from the beginning I
[55:21] tried to to uh I was trying to be
[55:28] FY so you know you get into all of these
[55:31] things it start becoming your toy you're
[55:34] trying to play it and look for colors
[55:36] and all of that so I said let me try
[55:38] this background and see how it will come
[55:40] up I hope you can be able to see amen
[55:42] amen if you can see tell me at the end
[55:44] of the service I will change it on my
[55:47] next
[55:48] slide praise the Lord
[55:51] amen but there there uh there uh our was
[55:54] strip scure we want to we want to read
[55:57] from this morning 2 John chapter 1 the
[56:00] first time we read this was on a
[56:02] Wednesday night we read the 13 verses
[56:05] and it was amazing as he he talks about
[56:08] the elect lady and he he wrote and the
[56:11] scholars put it in 13 verses and we pick
[56:14] that up 13 as the number of a woman
[56:17] praise the Lord and uh uh so let let's
[56:21] just read uh uh second joh John chapter
[56:28] 1 this this will actually be verse one
[56:31] and
[56:32] two the elect unto the elect lady and
[56:36] her
[56:37] children whom I love in the
[56:41] truth and not I only but also all they
[56:47] that have known the truth for the
[56:50] truth's sake now you have to know for
[56:53] the truth's sake is not this truth that
[56:56] he's talking about is not that I'm
[56:58] telling you the truth right the truth
[57:01] he's talking about is Jesus the truth
[57:04] Jesus identified himself that I am the
[57:09] way the truth and the life praise the
[57:14] Lord I I want to give you an assignment
[57:17] go and read the book of Acts you will
[57:19] realize that the early Christians before
[57:22] even they were called Christian when
[57:25] Jesus said I am the
[57:27] way they took that as their identity
[57:33] when Paul said their way that they call
[57:38] heresy their way that is called heresy
[57:41] which mean the Believers were they used
[57:43] to like we call ourself message
[57:46] believers they call themselves The Way
[57:49] We are the people of the
[57:52] way praise the Lord amen
[57:56] that's that's another that's another
[57:59] subject that's another subject but if
[58:01] you if you read the book of Acts and and
[58:04] if you just go through your Bible
[58:06] concordance and you just you just search
[58:08] out our way in the book of act you will
[58:11] realize that in the way that is
[58:14] expressed it was more like an
[58:16] identification to the early
[58:19] Christians then just saying you know uh
[58:22] uh this way no they were refering to
[58:25] Jesus yes Lord because he called himself
[58:28] the
[58:29] way so our
[58:32] calling God has set a path that we need
[58:35] to
[58:36] follow the cherubin in the Garden of
[58:39] Eden they were guiding their way to the
[58:43] treade of
[58:44] life so Jesus Calling himself the way it
[58:49] was not like uh uh uh like the way other
[58:53] religions or other you know uh uh uh
[58:56] people want to talk about it thank you
[58:59] thank
[59:02] you and uh uh so when John is speaking
[59:06] yet and he says the he unto the elect
[59:10] lady and her children whom I love in the
[59:16] truth and that I own it but Al but also
[59:21] all they that have known the truth
[59:25] for the truth's sake which dwelleth in
[59:28] us and shall be with us
[59:32] forever the truth promis that he will
[59:35] never leave us he will never forsake us
[59:39] praise the Lord you see this truth is an
[59:44] identification is an
[59:46] identification you see signs have been
[59:49] able to make a lie detector they can
[59:52] never make a truth detector
[59:55] because the truth detector is God
[59:57] himself yes right so true and the reason
[1:00:00] why they make a lie detector is because
[1:00:03] we were not made to tell
[1:00:09] lies let's pray together heavenly father
[1:00:12] as we get into this subject this this
[1:00:14] morning I'm I'm I'm trusting that your
[1:00:16] grace will come Lord and and help us
[1:00:19] Lord father you kind of for change our
[1:00:21] course of Direction this morning Lord
[1:00:24] around three father God telling this
[1:00:27] subject but uh you know the purpose Lord
[1:00:30] you know the desire father maybe it is
[1:00:33] just for one person Lord God father Lord
[1:00:36] because you are the one that leave the 9
[1:00:38] to9 and go after one father Lord God I I
[1:00:42] prayed and ask Lord God that uh if there
[1:00:45] is one let me be that one Lord and
[1:00:48] father we just want to ask your
[1:00:49] blessings oh God this morning upon the
[1:00:52] congregation of your people but let
[1:00:54] something be said of internal value that
[1:00:57] will that will draw us closer to you we
[1:01:00] commit ourself in your hands this
[1:01:02] morning bless your word in Jesus name
[1:01:05] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[1:01:07] your
[1:01:08] seat so as we look at the subject of the
[1:01:12] elected lady we realize that uh uh uh we
[1:01:18] we see here uh as we as we took the
[1:01:22] subject over this this is where this is
[1:01:26] where John got his his attraction to
[1:01:29] call the church an elect lady I was I
[1:01:32] was looking through some commentary and
[1:01:35] and someone was suggesting that John was
[1:01:37] writing this letter to Mary as the elect
[1:01:41] lady she's a type of the elect lady but
[1:01:43] she's not the elect lady praise the Lord
[1:01:46] amen she was elected in whatever she was
[1:01:50] called to do and just like we will see
[1:01:53] also this morning we will be dwelling on
[1:01:55] the character of Esther Esther was also
[1:01:59] elected Rahab was elected to save the
[1:02:03] the the spies Ruth was elected in the
[1:02:07] feet of
[1:02:09] boas and you and myself we are elected
[1:02:12] for this day amen for this age for this
[1:02:15] time this is our time yes if there was
[1:02:18] ever re reason why uh uh uh uh we were
[1:02:22] born is for this reason is for this
[1:02:24] moment is for this time in history like
[1:02:28] we will see it in the scripture so we
[1:02:30] see here uh uh uh Revelation chapter
[1:02:36] 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:02:40] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:02:43] Lamb is come and his wife have made
[1:02:46] herself ready and to her was
[1:02:50] granted the the the the the wife had
[1:02:52] made herself ready keep keep Esther in
[1:02:55] mind we we would dwell a whole lot in
[1:02:57] Esther because like I said I I I I had
[1:03:00] this subject on my mind I was going in a
[1:03:02] complete different way but something hit
[1:03:04] me and uh uh as I was studying uh I I I
[1:03:09] got I was I was studying something and
[1:03:13] uh uh I realized that uh the Book of
[1:03:17] Esther whole held the revelation of
[1:03:21] God's
[1:03:23] Providence that's what we want to talk
[1:03:25] about this morning God
[1:03:28] Providence God Intervention when God
[1:03:32] intervene in our
[1:03:34] life even when we don't ask him
[1:03:38] to that's his
[1:03:41] Providence
[1:03:46] amen as we sit here we all have one need
[1:03:50] or another on our mind as God said in
[1:03:53] heaven he thinking about the whole
[1:03:58] word I'm thinking about only my need God
[1:04:01] is thinking about the entire
[1:04:03] world he's thinking about the ones that
[1:04:06] are in church he's thinking about the
[1:04:07] ones that are on the street the homeless
[1:04:09] people the ones in the in the somebody
[1:04:12] that is struggling with drugs he say oh
[1:04:14] my dear
[1:04:15] creature he's he's thinking about his
[1:04:18] Providence we we get we get into that so
[1:04:21] but here said the scripture says uh uh
[1:04:24] Rejoice be glad give honor for the
[1:04:27] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[1:04:31] wife had made herself ready Paul uh John
[1:04:36] thinking about here the marriage of the
[1:04:38] Lamb the first time he was stand on the
[1:04:41] River Jordan and yet John the Baptist
[1:04:43] saying Behold the Lamb of God that takes
[1:04:46] away the sin of the world the marriage
[1:04:48] of the Lamb he seing this thing here he
[1:04:50] realized that back in Eden God had to
[1:04:53] slay a lamb to to to uh h h h redeem
[1:04:57] bring his children back into Fellowship
[1:05:00] so when John is hearing this thing in a

[1:09:58] listening to a to to a message I was
[1:10:00] listening to a brother preaching and
[1:10:03] then uh the thought just hit my
[1:10:06] mind uh uh I think we spoke about that

[1:10:18] Christ amen mistress Grace this elected
[1:10:22] woman
[1:10:24] how she was in the lineage of Jesus

[1:10:34] to you there are five
[1:10:36] women mentioned in the lineage of Jesus
[1:10:41] Christ praise the Lord five women that
[1:10:44] are mentioned in the lineage of Jesus
[1:10:47] Christ the fifth will be Mary the mother
[1:10:51] of
[1:10:52] Jesus she will be
[1:10:54] this virgin G that was visited by the
[1:10:57] angel Gabriel the same angel that
[1:10:59] visited Daniel that same Angel uh
[1:11:02] visited Mary and and and told her about
[1:11:05] about this promise that God made 700
[1:11:08] years before then and but before God
[1:11:13] before God could get a
[1:11:17] virgin before he could get a virgin to
[1:11:21] bring forth himself
[1:11:24] he brought for himself true
[1:11:28] tamama
[1:11:31] amen they had an insect with her
[1:11:34] father-in-law an insect re uh
[1:11:36] relationship if if we call it like that
[1:11:39] way had a child for her father father-in
[1:11:42] Lord before he could bring himself
[1:11:46] through uh uh uh h a virgin he brought
[1:11:50] himself through Rahab
[1:11:54] a street
[1:11:55] prostitute in
[1:11:59] Jericho are we together amen before he
[1:12:02] could bring himself through a virgin God
[1:12:05] said I will I will I will present myself
[1:12:09] a bride with our spot oreno which mean a
[1:12:12] virgin bride but before we get to be a
[1:12:16] virgin bride he take us from the West
[1:12:19] State of life it is not your natural
[1:12:22] birth that makes you a virgin bride
[1:12:28] no before he got to the place of being a
[1:12:31] ver of getting a virgin expressing
[1:12:33] himself through a virgin he brought
[1:12:36] himself through Ruth a moabit
[1:12:41] yes and the history of the moabit was
[1:12:44] Lot having children with his own
[1:12:47] daughters because his wife turned to a
[1:12:49] pillow of salt so there is no worst
[1:12:52] state that God can get you out of
[1:12:58] Amen praise the
[1:13:01] Lord before he got himself through a
[1:13:05] virgin bride he got
[1:13:10] himself through an adulterous act when
[1:13:15] David killed
[1:13:18] uras be if the fourth woman name her
[1:13:21] name is now called but she's referred to
[1:13:24] as uriah's wife God never erased
[1:13:29] that he never erased that that even in
[1:13:34] his lineage in the lineage of Jesus
[1:13:36] Christ it is mentioned uriah's
[1:13:45] wife are we
[1:13:49] together so don't make excuses of you
[1:13:53] your
[1:13:54] failures says oh well because I was born
[1:13:57] like this so there's no way I can be a
[1:13:59] bride of Jesus Christ no don't make
[1:14:02] don't make mistakes of your
[1:14:04] failures praise the Lord amen amen you
[1:14:09] never kill a man to marry to to sleep

[1:14:24] let me not go through all of that I
[1:14:25] might just take a much time here but it
[1:14:29] just it just it just hit me to see how
[1:14:32] Grace was in the
[1:14:36] lineage five is the number of
[1:14:40] Grace
[1:14:42] amen before Grace would get a virgin
[1:14:45] Grace got the worst

[1:15:09] wrinkle and they have the material the
[1:15:12] bride was given it was given unto her

[1:23:13] vain praise the
[1:23:16] Lord you can Trum

[1:23:33] vain the grace of God which was bestowed
[1:23:36] upon me was not in vain but I labor more
[1:23:40] abundantly than they are yet not I but
[1:23:43] the grace of God which was with me Paul
[1:23:48] in every area of his life having the
[1:23:51] privilege to get a Roman citizenship
[1:23:54] going to one of the best school have the
[1:23:56] best calamia as his teacher and and and
[1:24:00] everything that he went through to find
[1:24:02] himself holding this message of
[1:24:07] Grace praise the
[1:24:10] Lord he say if I'm
[1:24:14] anything is the grace of
[1:24:18] God that's
[1:24:21] Providence
[1:24:23] that's
[1:24:34] Providence the message is Wonder to
[1:24:36] perform and if you did just notice how
[1:24:41] it could have not have happened in in
[1:24:44] another time how God in his great wi
[1:24:49] Providence wise Providence how that he
[1:24:52] he moved every clock just to hit at the
[1:24:57] right
[1:24:58] time and that gave us Faith sometimes
[1:25:02] when we think oh everything is top SE to
[1:25:08] and there's no way
[1:25:10] out don't think that God's making it
[1:25:14] work just exactly I call him to his
[1:25:19] times
[1:25:21] program
[1:25:23] that's
[1:25:25] Providence praise the
[1:25:27] Lord like I said I was I was completely
[1:25:30] going a different way this with this
[1:25:34] subject and as I was looking through uh
[1:25:37] uh preach on the elected lady many times
[1:25:40] many times uh Nigeria know me for that
[1:25:44] that's one of my subject I preach over
[1:25:47] uh uh uh but uh as I was looking at the
[1:25:52] subject I had Esther in my mind but I
[1:25:54] was I was I was I was uh I was not going
[1:25:57] to dwell on her in a way that I did but
[1:26:00] as I was looking through it I decided to
[1:26:01] go back and look at some things and uh
[1:26:05] uh that that was when I really started
[1:26:06] seeing this whole this whole revelation
[1:26:09] of Providence that was hid in the life
[1:26:11] of Esther because if you read the book
[1:26:14] of Esther like eser will say theologians
[1:26:18] will say you never find the name of God
[1:26:20] in the Book of Esther
[1:26:23] you never find the name of God in the
[1:26:24] Book of
[1:26:25] Esther no reference to worship and Faith
[1:26:30] directly but you see Esther is
[1:26:33] projecting faith when she says tell Hima
[1:26:37] you prayed if I die I die right that's a
[1:26:40] statement of faith yes right but yet the
[1:26:42] scholars are saying there is no worship
[1:26:45] there is no faith in Esther they are
[1:26:47] they also saying it does not predate
[1:26:50] anything about the mesiah
[1:26:53] no mention of Heaven and
[1:26:55] Hell and even
[1:26:58] Luther uh uh uh Martin Luther the great
[1:27:02] reformer he's he's the one that I got
[1:27:04] this quote from uh from from in one of
[1:27:07] his things that he wrote about the the
[1:27:09] Book of Esther he says um uh I am so
[1:27:13] great an enemy to the second book of the
[1:27:15] maab and to Esther that it that I wish
[1:27:20] they had not come to us at all for they
[1:27:23] have too many hidden so you you see you
[1:27:27] you you see that and that's why he was a
[1:27:31] reformer amen amen he was a reformer h h
[1:27:35] h had this inspiration of bringing the
[1:27:37] church out of catholism but the four
[1:27:40] world was not
[1:27:42] there
[1:27:44] amen even at a place where he he called
[1:27:47] the Jews the Antichrist he was a
[1:27:51] reformer
[1:27:52] so uh uh uh
[1:27:57] uh but that that's what that's what
[1:28:00] scholar thinks about the Book of
[1:28:04] Esther but what what they don't see in
[1:28:07] the Book of Esther is that the name of
[1:28:10] God is mentioned the Jews will tell you
[1:28:14] that uh because the book was written in
[1:28:18] Hebrew and if you if you read the book
[1:28:22] in Hebrew that the Jews has been able to
[1:28:26] find their unpronouncable name of God
[1:28:30] many people call it
[1:28:33] Yahweh the Jews would call it heavy V
[1:28:37] that uh that name that is spelled
[1:28:42] yhw now now there they will tell you
[1:28:46] that in in in in in four different
[1:28:48] sequence they have been able to find the
[1:28:50] name of God they have being able to find
[1:28:53] that unpronouncable name of God in the
[1:28:55] Book of Esther I was looking at some of
[1:28:58] that during the week but it's it's not
[1:29:00] uh I don't have the brain for all of
[1:29:02] that I'm just bringing this as
[1:29:03] information just to be able to make uh
[1:29:06] uh this is uh uh make a background for
[1:29:09] where we want to go it's not a
[1:29:10] theological study and another thing a
[1:29:13] Jews uh uh uh historian says the name of
[1:29:18] Esther means something hidden
[1:29:24] praise the Lord
[1:29:27] amen and Providence is something
[1:29:32] hidden God's Providence God's
[1:29:37] intervention we say he's an ontime
[1:29:41] God he don't always
[1:29:43] come when we want him right amen but God
[1:29:48] is never too early and he's never late
[1:29:51] amen
[1:29:52] am he's always on
[1:29:56] time praise the Lord amen are we
[1:30:00] together now so when you look at this
[1:30:03] this this whole thing it grabs your
[1:30:06] attention you you you want to see this
[1:30:09] Providence and and that is the place
[1:30:11] where I took my whole twist yesterday
[1:30:13] and uh uh you know when when I when I
[1:30:16] caught this so I'm actually getting
[1:30:18] going farther away from the way that I
[1:30:21] thought I would I will bring this
[1:30:23] subject uh so we want we want to see
[1:30:26] that area of Providence because uh just
[1:30:30] like we said is is for time like this
[1:30:32] there was a time that came in Esther
[1:30:35] life where Mory had to remind
[1:30:40] her that it was for time like
[1:30:44] this that you were raising
[1:30:47] up praise the Lord and and if you read
[1:30:51] the book of yes sir Maliki make it clear
[1:30:53] to her if you don't do nothing about it
[1:30:56] God will do
[1:30:58] something amen amen amen so don't don't
[1:31:01] think that we are relying on you when
[1:31:03] God promised to build his church he said
[1:31:06] I will build my
[1:31:08] church he never says h h h you know
[1:31:11] brother one or some kind of a Preacher
[1:31:14] uh uh for somebody to make thems
[1:31:16] indispensable that without you nothing
[1:31:18] can happen get out of the way God will
[1:31:20] raise men amen that's right amen God
[1:31:25] told I mean Mali told Esther if you
[1:31:27] don't do nothing let me let you know God
[1:31:30] will do something
[1:31:35] am praise the
[1:31:37] Lord I believe he was standing at the
[1:31:40] same place of shedra mishad and abeno
[1:31:43] our God will deliver us even if he done
[1:31:46] we are not going to bow
[1:31:50] down
[1:31:52] so we want to see that Provident we want
[1:31:54] to see how this whole thing came how the
[1:31:56] whole thing came in and the Book of
[1:31:58] Esther is actually raing in a period of
[1:32:01] time where Israel h h h uh uh
[1:32:08] uh uh have had an aile from from from
[1:32:13] Babylon and there were certain Jews that
[1:32:16] decided to stay
[1:32:19] back they decided to say you have to
[1:32:22] remember sarus you know helped them to
[1:32:24] build the city and go back but certain
[1:32:26] Jews decided to stay in the land of the
[1:32:29] m and in Persian and this is the time
[1:32:32] that took place so the the whole setting
[1:32:35] of Esther is right in between the time
[1:32:38] of Ezra and
[1:32:41] neemias are we together
[1:32:44] amen now let's get on our journey this
[1:32:48] is what is going to take uh uh uh uh uh
[1:32:52] this is what is going to take a very
[1:32:55] interesting you know place I I want to
[1:32:58] bring this to you now as a as a
[1:33:01] remembrance before we get into our whole
[1:33:03] thing of
[1:33:09] Esther if you if you see can is can you
[1:33:13] see
[1:33:14] okay are you seeing okay praise the
[1:33:18] lord it's it's not too clear okay so I
[1:33:22] got to change this s think maybe I just
[1:33:25] stick with my black and
[1:33:29] white okay now but uh what what what is
[1:33:33] this is that uh we'll be reading from uh
[1:33:36] Exodus chapter 17 you can put the
[1:33:38] scripture down and then you can get the
[1:33:39] whole story when you get back home but
[1:33:42] Exodus chapter 17 this is the period of
[1:33:45] time where Israel is on their Journey
[1:33:47] they are out of the land of Egypt they
[1:33:49] are on their Journey this will be the
[1:33:52] first battle this will be the first
[1:33:55] group of people that will stand in the
[1:33:57] way of
[1:34:00] Israel there's the amalik the amalekites
[1:34:03] the amalec they will be the first one
[1:34:07] this is where the battle where uh the
[1:34:09] Lord told them to raise the hand of
[1:34:11] Moses just to give you a background but
[1:34:14] this is the picture I want you to grab
[1:34:16] as we look here because these people
[1:34:19] were stopping Israel from going into
[1:34:22] their promised land they were becoming a
[1:34:25] storing block oh God knows how to deal
[1:34:28] with storing block amen amen amen God
[1:34:32] knows how to deal with stomy block yes
[1:34:35] because when God made his promise his
[1:34:37] promise have to come to pass and there
[1:34:40] is nothing that is going to stand in his
[1:34:41] way amen these were the first group of
[1:34:44] people that stopped Israel and see how
[1:34:46] God would deal with faith the Lord said
[1:34:48] unto Moses write this for a memorial in
[1:34:51] a
[1:34:54] book write this for a memorial in a book
[1:34:59] and rehearse it in the ears of of Joshua
[1:35:04] for I will utterly P out the remembrance
[1:35:08] of amalik from under
[1:35:12] Heaven God is saying I'm going to WEP
[1:35:15] them
[1:35:17] out I'm going to WEP them
[1:35:20] out there is lot of things that
[1:35:22] explaining in the political spheres of
[1:35:24] Jerusalem and Hamas I don't want to get
[1:35:26] into that I'm not a
[1:35:29] politician but one thing I always say is
[1:35:33] prophecy is stronger than
[1:35:38] politics praise the
[1:35:43] Lord this is the people that is stopping
[1:35:46] stopping God they are stopping God from
[1:35:49] bringing his promise to pass
[1:35:55] the very reason why God would tell so
[1:35:58] why persecute th me is because God is in
[1:36:03] the midst of his
[1:36:06] people that's the reason why he said if
[1:36:08] you do something to any of my little
[1:36:10] ones it's better you put a millstone on
[1:36:13] your neck and dash yourself in the seed
[1:36:15] because I'm not going to let it go
[1:36:18] that's how much God is involved in his
[1:36:22] church that's how much God is involved
[1:36:25] among his people he told Moses I want to
[1:36:28] come down and dwell with you and make
[1:36:31] you
[1:36:32] all a treasure of priest amen a kingdom
[1:36:36] of
[1:36:38] priest the God we serve is not a distant
[1:36:42] God it's not a God that sits in an
[1:36:44] imaginary Heaven no he's here he's Among
[1:36:48] Us he's a god that is among us and he's
[1:36:52] interested in our
[1:36:55] Affairs that's what I said if you get in
[1:36:57] business with God God don't play
[1:37:00] stupid and neither is he playing
[1:37:06] games praise the Lord and here's a group
[1:37:10] of people that are trying to make
[1:37:12] themselves a hindrance to
[1:37:14] Israel trying to make thems a hands to
[1:37:18] the
[1:37:19] exitor when God said I will come down
[1:37:22] that's what he told Abraham I will come
[1:37:25] down and with a mighty hand I will
[1:37:28] deliver them amen I will bring them into
[1:37:32] this land that I have given to
[1:37:35] you and the Lord said unto Moses write
[1:37:37] it in the book of Memorial and rehearse
[1:37:40] it in the in the ears of Joshua I will
[1:37:43] Ally put out the remembrance of amalec
[1:37:47] from under the heaven and Moses build an
[1:37:50] altar and called the name Jehovah Nishi
[1:37:54] that's where that name that was where
[1:37:57] God expressed himself that I will defend
[1:38:00] you from these
[1:38:02] people I will defend you now listen to
[1:38:05] what the Lord says here he says he said
[1:38:07] because the Lord have shown that the
[1:38:11] Lord will have war is no longer Israel
[1:38:15] having war with amalec there myself in
[1:38:18] war amen amen praise the Lord amen this
[1:38:23] is a parent that is saying you touch my
[1:38:25] child child get back here deal with
[1:38:28] me he's
[1:38:31] saying I'm having war with

[1:38:41] I will blood them
[1:38:45] out are we together
[1:38:50] amen
[1:38:53] he says I have
[1:38:55] sown that the Lord will have war with
[1:38:59] AMC from generation to
[1:39:02] generation praise the Lord God is saying
[1:39:06] I will always raise up somebody that
[1:39:08] will have the courage until I terminate
[1:39:12] amalec from under the heavens from
[1:39:14] generation to generation I will always
[1:39:17] raise up somebody
[1:39:20] amen praise the Lord you want to stop my
[1:39:26] promise praise the Lord you want to stop
[1:39:29] my promise you want to bring reproach
[1:39:31] against
[1:39:35] me are we together
[1:39:43] amen let's look at this also God
[1:39:46] rehearsed the same promise over in the
[1:39:49] book of Deuteronomy
[1:39:51] 25 you can read the entire chapter he
[1:39:54] said remember what amalec did unto thee
[1:39:57] by the way when ye were come forth out
[1:39:59] of Egypt how he met thee by the way and
[1:40:04] uh uh and SM the the high most of thee
[1:40:09] even all that were feeble behind thee so
[1:40:12] they were they they were they were they
[1:40:14] were they were they were uh killing the
[1:40:16] old people and and you know uh uh uh
[1:40:19] afraid of the man of war but dealing
[1:40:21] with the people that were
[1:40:24] vulnerable amen
[1:40:27] amen even the feeble behind thee when
[1:40:30] thou were faint and
[1:40:32] weary and he fear not God therefore it
[1:40:36] shall be when the Lord thy God have
[1:40:38] given thee rest from all thine enemies
[1:40:42] around about in the land which the Lord
[1:40:45] thy God have given thee for an
[1:40:47] inheritance to possess it that thou
[1:40:50] shall blood out prise God their
[1:40:54] remembrance thou shall blot out their
[1:40:58] remembrance of amalik from under
[1:41:01] Heaven thou shall not forget
[1:41:06] it praise the Lord forget your name but
[1:41:10] don't
[1:41:13] forget praise the Lord amen if anything
[1:41:16] that is standing your way as a storing
[1:41:18] block from getting to the
[1:41:22] promise
[1:41:25] amen are we
[1:41:31] together you see the
[1:41:36] progression we are we are talking about
[1:41:38] Divine
[1:41:39] Providence is that what we talking about
[1:41:42] amen Follow Me Now 1 Samuel chapter 15
[1:41:46] we got to go quick cuz I'm doing a lot
[1:41:48] of uh Bible study when I'm supposed to
[1:41:51] be
[1:41:53] preaching or am I
[1:41:58] preaching let's go 1 Samuel chapter 15
[1:42:01] Saul or Samuel also said unto Saul
[1:42:05] listen to this so you can be able to
[1:42:07] grab the picture
[1:42:09] Samuel also said unto Saul the Lord sent
[1:42:13] me to anoint thee to be king over his
[1:42:16] people over Israel now therefore heing
[1:42:20] there onto the voice of the word of the
[1:42:23] Lord thus say the
[1:42:28] Lord
[1:42:31] amen okay thus say the Lord of hosts I
[1:42:36] remember that which am like did to
[1:42:39] Israel this is God
[1:42:42] speaking this is God speaking the same
[1:42:45] way that he take our labor of love to
[1:42:49] his heart
[1:42:51] and in the Book of Revelation he says I
[1:42:53] remember your labor of love that's the
[1:42:56] same way God
[1:42:59] remember he told Moses I
[1:43:02] remember what I said to Abraham God
[1:43:05] remember
[1:43:08] yes praise the
[1:43:11] Lord that's the reason why God will
[1:43:14] never be inde deped to no
[1:43:17] man because God remember and he pay his
[1:43:24] debts he remember and he pay his
[1:43:30] debts I remember that which amalec did
[1:43:33] to Israel how he laid with he laid wait
[1:43:37] for them in the way when he came up to
[1:43:42] Egypt and go and smart
[1:43:45] amalec and utterly destroy all that they
[1:43:49] have
[1:43:51] and spare them
[1:43:53] n but slay both men women infants
[1:43:59] sucklings which which mean
[1:44:02] babies oxin sheeps
[1:44:06] cell
[1:44:09] everything everything amen praise the
[1:44:12] Lord
[1:44:14] everything this is going to is is going
[1:44:17] to get the eight years why how can this
[1:44:19] be a loving God he has a right to do it
[1:44:22] because he created
[1:44:28] it he has a right to do it because he
[1:44:30] created it he can WEP the whole thing
[1:44:33] out and start a new one he don't want to
[1:44:36] do it he want to show to these ones that
[1:44:38] he have created I'm the one in
[1:44:45] charge are we together am now what I
[1:44:49] want you to see God's said I will have
[1:44:52] war with am from generation to
[1:44:54] generation the reason why Saul was
[1:44:56] raised up his purpose he purpose in
[1:45:00] life that God raised him up trained
[1:45:05] him he went looking for his father H H
[1:45:09] eyes that was lost and all of that God
[1:45:13] God in intervention at the time he was
[1:45:15] not
[1:45:17] expecting God stepped on the scene and
[1:45:19] got his atten
[1:45:23] that he will come in the presence of a
[1:45:25] of of of of of the Prophet he's even
[1:45:29] he's even doubtful of himself am I not a
[1:45:36] benjamite there's a story to that but I
[1:45:38] I will leave that for now and uh uh uh
[1:45:42] but the this is the reason why this is
[1:45:44] the reason and the reason why Saul lost
[1:45:50] theing kingom is because he lost God's
[1:45:53] purpose the reason why God set him on
[1:45:55] the throne he missed it this was the
[1:45:58] reason I eliminate
[1:46:04] AMC he lost
[1:46:06] it he lost
[1:46:10] it and that is that is the same thing to
[1:46:13] each and every one of us we have a
[1:46:16] reason why this Grace has come before us
[1:46:19] let me tell you you lost this
[1:46:21] opportunity you're going to live a life
[1:46:23] of

[1:46:30] that's right you have other women you
[1:46:32] they can never be nice to you praise the
[1:46:35] Lord
[1:46:37] amen because that was not your
[1:46:40] purpose that was not your
[1:46:44] purpose this was his
[1:46:46] purpose when he lost this the Bible says
[1:46:49] he started
[1:46:51] inan that was when he started throwing
[1:46:54] javelins at David
[1:46:57] wow he started getting angry he want to
[1:46:59] kill his own
[1:47:02] son this was his purpose
[1:47:06] amen watch and see let's read the next
[1:47:10] scripture praise the Lord
[1:47:13] amen are you having fun yet
[1:47:18] amen praise the Lorden okay this thing

[1:47:36] okay technicians would deal with
[1:47:43] that praise the
[1:47:48] Lord Grace let's move to sfil okay thank
[1:47:52] you now watch here the the Bible says
[1:47:56] here Samuel instructing him and told him
[1:48:01] anoint him
[1:48:02] King and says go take care of the
[1:48:06] amlet woman men children babies animals
[1:48:11] wepe everything
[1:48:12] out everything that is called AMC I say
[1:48:15] I will take their remembrance from under
[1:48:18] the heavens that's what God Said
[1:48:23] now watch here
[1:48:26] now and saw
[1:48:29] smart the the amalekites from Heaven
[1:48:33] until they come to sh that was over
[1:48:37] against Egypt and he took AA the king of
[1:48:41] AMC aive if you take the king you have
[1:48:44] not done nothing because he's the head
[1:48:46] of the
[1:48:48] people if you save the king you save the
[1:49:02] nation and he took ha the king alive and
[1:49:05] and Al toly destroy all the people with
[1:49:08] the asge of the SW but Saul and his
[1:49:10] people SP a and the best of the sheep
[1:49:13] and The Oxen and the fatling and the
[1:49:16] lamb and all that I good and will not
[1:49:19] utter destroy them but everything that
[1:49:22] was alive that everything that was vow
[1:49:26] and
[1:49:27] refused there they destroy Ally which
[1:49:31] mean he just went for all the all the
[1:49:33] the ones that were not good praise the
[1:49:36] Lord amen and to him you see it it is
[1:49:40] this thing that's that's where the
[1:49:41] church has got herself that's where we
[1:49:44] have got ourself we want to help
[1:49:47] God we want to help God
[1:49:51] praise the Lord you never have God to
[1:49:53] bring you

[1:50:30] scepter is promised to
[1:50:33] Judah and God will bring Benjamin that's
[1:50:36] a reason why if you go back to the judge

[1:50:44] place but it will not go there now for

[1:54:25] repentance it's a it's a word that means
[1:54:28] it changed my mind that's where Saul
[1:54:30] lost the
[1:54:33] kingdom that's where he lost the
[1:54:38] kingdom praise the
[1:54:41] Lord it repent me that I have set up
[1:54:45] Saul to be king for he is turned back
[1:54:48] from foll
[1:54:50] me he thought that he was doing
[1:54:53] something to please God what will he
[1:54:57] tell Samuel I save all of these sheep to
[1:54:59] make
[1:55:00] sacrifice God told you he had run out of

[1:55:23] way so we can we can make
[1:55:26] members God told you that he had lost
[1:55:28] the Holy Ghost to change man heart he
[1:55:31] told you that the power of conviction
[1:55:33] has been taken away amen that we must
[1:55:36] substitute it for games and substitute
[1:55:38] it for different things just so we can
[1:55:39] we can we can make
[1:55:43] church
[1:55:48] God

[1:55:57] back from following me think about
[1:56:01] it he never left
[1:56:05] church he never left
[1:56:08] church it was
[1:56:10] something he did in his heart something
[1:56:15] he was trying to earnestly do and God
[1:56:18] considered that that he had turned his
[1:56:21] back from following
[1:56:25] me you can sit right in this church and
[1:56:29] be away from
[1:56:35] God praise the
[1:56:37] Lord you can be faithful in paying your
[1:56:40] ties and be away from
[1:56:48] God
[1:56:52] he has turned us back from following
[1:56:54] me and have not performed my commandment
[1:56:58] that's what God is interested in he
[1:57:00] never did my word if you leave the word
[1:57:03] of God you have left
[1:57:06] God you have left God you leave the
[1:57:08] principle of God's word you have left
[1:57:11] God you are only making a god of your
[1:57:18] imagination
[1:57:21] are we together
[1:57:24] amen he have not performed my
[1:57:28] commandment and the Bible says and it
[1:57:30] grieved
[1:57:31] Samuel and he cried he cried onto the
[1:57:35] Lord all night a man is
[1:57:40] satisfying his own
[1:57:43] desire and here is another man that is
[1:57:46] burdened with his Arrow amen yes another
[1:57:50] man that is burdened with his error and
[1:57:52] crying to
[1:57:58] God praise the Lord
[1:58:00] [Music]
[1:58:02] amen sometimes you don't we don't know
[1:58:05] we don't have to tell you
[1:58:08] everything but this is not a game
[1:58:12] show it's not a game
[1:58:17] show praise the Lord amen
[1:58:23] there are things we know you see people
[1:58:25] going through it gives you sleepest
[1:58:27] night you stay up you cry you deny
[1:58:30] yourself you fast and pray that God get
[1:58:33] to this person help this
[1:58:40] situation because sometimes you you try
[1:58:42] to talk to people to become they become
[1:58:44] arrogant who you think you are I'm
[1:58:46] nobody I'm I'm I'm just I'm just a
[1:58:48] sevenant to you I'm not your boss I'm
[1:58:51] placed here to serve you and have one
[1:58:54] person to report is almighty God oh

[1:59:05] should I should do it Faithfully because
[1:59:07] it's him I'm going to report I don't
[1:59:08] look at your
[1:59:11] attitude let's one man disobeying God's
[1:59:14] word is causing another man sleep the
[1:59:17] Bible say he pray all not crying to
[1:59:21] God why because when a king has gone out
[1:59:25] of the word of God the whole Land Is
[1:59:27] Lost amen the people has rejected the
[1:59:30] prophet they wanted a king yes a king
[1:59:32] that has turned his back on God not
[1:59:35] fulfilling God's
[1:59:41] commandment Samuel as a prophet he's
[1:59:43] worried we are exposed when you leave
[1:59:46] the word of God you are naked I don't
[1:59:49] care what kind of a faction clothes you
[1:59:52] you you buy yourself to wear if it is
[1:59:54] not what God want you to wear the de say
[1:59:58] you are naked before
[2:00:01] God you can wear your two2 $300 cloth
[2:00:05] God see you as a straight bare naked
[2:00:07] person in the
[2:00:18] street
[2:00:21] are we
[2:00:23] together
[2:00:26] now we are looking at
[2:00:31] Providence but we just got a history
[2:00:33] here and this history take us back to
[2:00:36] the beginning of the church it take us
[2:00:38] back to the beginning of Israel joining
[2:00:41] where
[2:00:43] God is standing up for Israel and says
[2:00:46] these people God himself is the one that
[2:00:48] says I will bring them out with a mighty
[2:00:50] hand yes the the Egyptian you see today
[2:00:53] you will see them no more forever God
[2:00:55] was taking his people to his
[2:00:58] promise Amen to the promised land and
[2:01:03] here's a nation here that came and
[2:01:05] Israel beg these people just let them
[2:01:07] pass we will not take nothing from you
[2:01:10] we don't want anything we just want to
[2:01:12] pass they said
[2:01:15] no they said
[2:01:18] no
[2:01:21] praise the
[2:01:22] Lord and now God says you now you now
[2:01:26] have issue with me if unless I'm not the
[2:01:30] one that made the Heaven and Earth but
[2:01:32] as long as Heaven and Earth remains I
[2:01:34] will block you out
[2:01:39] completely are we
[2:01:43] together now so this failure this
[2:01:47] particular failure of
[2:01:51] sa what have he
[2:01:53] done he have it have
[2:01:57] allow the lineage of amalik to
[2:02:01] continue praise the Lord amen amen
[2:02:04] because Saul will will later kill the
[2:02:08] king of AA but there were some men that
[2:02:11] have already
[2:02:13] escaped okay amen amen so some of the
[2:02:17] sons of haar have already escaped you
[2:02:20] will see what I'm going with this you
[2:02:22] will see what I'm going with
[2:02:26] this it looks like a lot of uh Bible
[2:02:29] reading I'm not even got to my message
[2:02:31] yet but I just want to bring you to this
[2:02:33] place of Providence now look at this the
[2:02:36] Bible now will give us a story yet I
[2:02:38] have a topic that I called Moi
[2:02:41] background
[2:02:44] amen the Bible will give us a story here
[2:02:48] now that that is about David when uh
[2:02:51] when uh Absalon came against David and
[2:02:54] David own son kick him from the throne
[2:02:56] he was paying for his wrong that he have
[2:02:58] done but let's let's go on the Bible
[2:03:01] says and when David came to baham behold
[2:03:05] then came out a man of the family of the
[2:03:08] House of Saul whose name was shimia amen
[2:03:13] a son of girro he came forth and
[2:03:17] cursed still as he came he was just
[2:03:21] ruing curses on David and and and and he
[2:03:24] cast stone at David and his Serv and all
[2:03:27] the people the mighty men that were with
[2:03:29] David and uh uh uh now this Gody is
[2:03:32] cursing David now oh you you you are the
[2:03:34] one that uh that that makes s to lose
[2:03:37] the throne you know he's cursing David
[2:03:39] he's taking this thing as a trouble
[2:03:41] problem he's not seeing that Saul
[2:03:43] disobeyed God he's not seeing that God
[2:03:45] was the one that makes Saul King and God
[2:03:48] was the one that took the kingdom of
[2:03:49] Saul he's now making the David's problem
[2:03:52] he's curing David he's throwing stone at
[2:03:54] David if you go down in the reading one
[2:03:57] of David men got so angry
[2:03:59] abishai and he says why should I allow
[2:04:03] this dog to spit on my king praise the
[2:04:06] Lord David told him leave leave him
[2:04:08] maybe God told him to do it maybe by
[2:04:10] this I might find Mercy before
[2:04:14] God praise the Lord let me speed you now
[2:04:18] if you go further after David was now
[2:04:23] being brought back to the kingdom here
[2:04:25] is shimad year seeking
[2:04:28] repentance praise the Lord in chapter 19
[2:04:32] there came over a fot to carry over the
[2:04:35] king household so they brought a fairy
[2:04:37] Bo to carry the king back over to
[2:04:39] Jerusalem and to do what he taught good
[2:04:43] and shim the son of jira fell down
[2:04:46] before the king as he
[2:04:49] was come over Jordan and he said unto
[2:04:52] the king let not my Lord impute iniquity
[2:04:54] unto me neither do thou remember that
[2:04:58] which thy servant did perversely the day
[2:05:02] that my Lord the king went out of
[2:05:04] Jerusalem that the king should take it
[2:05:06] to heart for th servant does know that I
[2:05:10] have seen it now so he's trying to make
[2:05:12] his way right he's trying to make his
[2:05:15] way right there's a reason why I'm
[2:05:17] bringing these two things to you and
[2:05:19] this is the reason if you look here you
[2:05:23] will see that uh uh uh in in uh uh
[2:05:30] uh 2 Samuel chapter 16 that we have just
[2:05:35] read amen
[2:05:39] amen okay shim
[2:05:44] repentance okay yeah this is where I'm
[2:05:47] supposed to be sorry sorry now so we see
[2:05:51] here H H uh if you look in Esther you go
[2:05:55] back now to Esther see see how we how
[2:05:58] how the whole thing is going to play out
[2:06:00] here if you are follow me you enjoy it
[2:06:02] if not uh I don't know where you
[2:06:09] are now so you see your eser chapter 2
[2:06:13] verse 5 now in shushan the palace there

[2:06:41] good
[2:06:43] amen when David Spar
[2:06:46] shimi wow and David never knew this now
[2:06:50] that he was thinking about it because
[2:06:51] the time of Esther is far in front of

[2:06:57] also Esther chapter 3 and the King took
[2:07:01] his ring from his hand and gave it unto

[2:07:19] of what AMC
[2:07:21] yes the one that saw spare
[2:07:30] yes are you seeing the
[2:07:32] Providence why because God make a
[2:07:37] promise he made a promise to eliminate
[2:07:41] these
[2:07:42] people and now he's making Providence
[2:07:45] he's making
[2:07:47] provision to be able to keep his
[2:07:53] promise so David Spar the king of God
[2:07:57] saw Spar
[2:08:03] shimi are we together
[2:08:10] amen I just don't want to read a lot of
[2:08:12] bible verses to you I want you to grab
[2:08:15] the picture of God's Providence
[2:08:20] praise the
[2:08:23] Lord

[2:08:31] certain place

[2:08:47] Providence he said you have not choosen
[2:08:50] me I have choosen you praise the
[2:08:53] Lord and he knows how to deal with
[2:08:55] things in our lives he know how to bring
[2:08:59] us to the place where he want us to be
[2:09:02] that's
[2:09:04] righten praise the Lord amen now you see
[2:09:08] the thing about it there is that we get
[2:09:11] lazy yeah God knows how to do this thing
[2:09:13] I'm I'm just going to lay back and let
[2:09:16] God do it well you have not come to the
[2:09:20] recognition that Providence has been
[2:09:22] watching over your
[2:09:24] life you are not appreciating the grace
[2:09:27] of God that have kept you alive till
[2:09:31] now

[2:09:44] the sea he will bring he will reach his
[2:09:45] hand down he knows how to save you he
[2:09:48] can also allow you to be theread and
[2:09:50] save you from this word right that's
[2:09:52] another way of saving you that's right
[2:09:55] allow you to be there we bury you you
[2:09:57] are safe under the ground you are not
[2:09:59] going to be drowned you are not going to
[2:10:00] be stupid anymore that's another way of
[2:10:03] saving you he knows how to do
[2:10:13] that praise the Lord but see see the
[2:10:17] picture I'm trying to bring to you here
[2:10:19] is that God made that promise back there
[2:10:22] he watched over his word and here it
[2:10:24] said there is that down in the Captivity
[2:10:28] of the missions and the person after the
[2:10:30] Babylonian captivity
[2:10:32] God kept this man Miki at a place where
[2:10:37] he was able to take his uh his brother's
[2:10:40] daughter or Uncle daughter whoever that
[2:10:42] Esther was and and all of these things
[2:10:44] Miki just being a good Jew he loved the
[2:10:47] Lord you know he dedicated his life to
[2:10:50] serve the Lord having no thought in his
[2:10:53] mind that the promise that God made to
[2:10:56] to eliminate the amalaki will have his
[2:10:59] final end wow
[2:11:05] wow never even knew that all of his life
[2:11:10] when he took this girl whether her
[2:11:12] parents passed away he fell in love with
[2:11:14] when he took this girl never knew it was
[2:11:17] not in his mind
[2:11:19] yeah that this is what was going to
[2:11:22] happen but all along God
[2:11:25] knew sir prise all alone God
[2:11:30] knew it never came to him by surprise
[2:11:33] that's
[2:11:36] [Music]
[2:11:39] right are you seeing the
[2:11:45] picture now for what reason the Bible
[2:11:48] here will call this guy the Jews enemy
[2:11:53] for some reason being a son of an
[2:11:58] amalec praise the Lord amen you remember
[2:12:02] when Saul
[2:12:03] died there was a guy that ran over to
[2:12:06] David trying to win his favor right
[2:12:08] right and say oh my
[2:12:10] Lord oh my Lord I just came from the
[2:12:13] battle and uh you know and saw and
[2:12:17] just
[2:12:19] when he never s trying to win David
[2:12:22] favor he lie on
[2:12:24] himself that I care sword right the man
[2:12:28] that been hunting your
[2:12:30] life David say who son you are he says
[2:12:33] I'm an AM malachite yes David spit on
[2:12:36] the ground and said before my spit
[2:12:40] dry he hair should not be on his
[2:12:43] shoulder and a malachite
[2:12:46] amen you put your hand on a son of of of
[2:12:50] EZ yes sir when God has given us a word
[2:12:53] to eliminate you people from all the
[2:12:58] Earth you see that's that's that's how
[2:13:01] God's children take God's word
[2:13:04] important it could be easier for David
[2:13:06] to say oh give me half five thank you
[2:13:09] you are a nice
[2:13:13] guide he knew what the word of God
[2:13:16] said
[2:13:19] no
[2:13:20] investigation you are an AM malachite
[2:13:23] you Brave to come to me to tell me that
[2:13:26] you kill the
[2:13:29] [Music]
[2:13:31] king when we take the word of God in our
[2:13:35] lives when we take it to be the very
[2:13:38] breath that we
[2:13:41] breathe you can't get favor until God
[2:13:44] give it to
[2:13:46] you so why Try to please people and try
[2:13:49] to rub arms with them and if God don't
[2:13:51] give it to you you won't get
[2:13:54] it you are what you are by the grace of
[2:13:58] God you are where you are by the grace
[2:14:00] of God whether you appreciate on that
[2:14:04] God the god of the universe is
[2:14:06] responsible for you whether you believe
[2:14:08] him or not he's responsible for you at
[2:14:10] the end of the day he will have his way
[2:14:13] in your
[2:14:16] life he bring you to heaven or he send
[2:14:18] you to hell does not make no difference
[2:14:21] to
[2:14:24] [Music]
[2:14:25] him God don't provide for you because
[2:14:28] you come to church he provide for you
[2:14:30] because he gave you birth to live so
[2:14:34] he's responsible for
[2:14:42] you
[2:14:45] Providence Providence will now set our
[2:14:47] seen in the Book of Ruth uh the Book of
[2:14:52] Esther sorry I took a lot of time yet
[2:14:54] taking us from one scripture to another
[2:14:56] I realize my time is gone so you you you
[2:15:00] see the picture here but there is
[2:15:01] something I want to I want to come to
[2:15:02] before we close here and and and uh uh
[2:15:05] so it said our our our whole picture
[2:15:09] this whole elected lady why Esther why
[2:15:13] Esther God was just only showing his
[2:15:17] revelation of
[2:15:20] Providence that his word will not return
[2:15:23] back to him vow whatever he said he's
[2:15:26] going to do it he will keep his word if
[2:15:30] God promised to give you the Holy Ghost
[2:15:33] it's because you are a son of God you
[2:15:35] are bound to have
[2:15:37] it he desire his desire to give it to
[2:15:41] you is more than you want
[2:15:46] it it's more than you want
[2:16:00] it praise the
[2:16:12] Lord so he said our will whole
[2:16:16] senor go read the book of Esther you get
[2:16:19] the
[2:16:20] picture you get right there in the in
[2:16:22] the in the in the first chapter of the
[2:16:24] Bible talking about King has a serious
[2:16:26] calling for the feast now if you don't
[2:16:29] get the background you would think that
[2:16:31] this was a beauty pant it was not a
[2:16:33] beauty pent that that brought Esther
[2:16:35] into the into the kingdom it looks like
[2:16:37] it but it was not a beauty
[2:16:40] pant praise the Lord let me set a little
[2:16:43] historical scene here for you hus was
[2:16:46] going on a battle
[2:16:48] he was going to Revenge his father
[2:16:52] darus he was going for the war so this
[2:16:56] is the way that the the the Kings
[2:16:59] convince the people according to history
[2:17:03] he that Feast was a six-month
[2:17:07] Feast he was trying to ride the people
[2:17:11] the Army you know celebrating Victory
[2:17:14] before even to go for the
[2:17:16] victory praise the Lord
[2:17:19] that's what a son service is you are
[2:17:21] celebrating Victory before even the word
[2:17:23] of God
[2:17:24] comes true praise the
[2:17:28] Lord that's that's that's why they did
[2:17:30] that they celebrate their Victory have a
[2:17:33] feast and then if you go farther back in
[2:17:36] the in the story of Esther you will
[2:17:38] realize that even when Esther became
[2:17:40] king there was a certain time she will
[2:17:43] come she can show up to the
[2:17:45] king she was in a different different
[2:17:47] Palace than the King right the king had
[2:17:51] to call her some of the reason there
[2:17:55] because as as as as as Idol Kings many
[2:17:58] of them were on the polygamy they had
[2:18:00] one Queen and many
[2:18:03] concubines so the queen do not stay in
[2:18:06] the king's chamber she has her own
[2:18:08] chamber she can only come when the king
[2:18:11] call
[2:18:13] her praise the Lord so now when you
[2:18:16] follow the you realize that Esther in I
[2:18:20] mean vasage in her kingdom she was
[2:18:23] already having something with the women
[2:18:25] it was now her time to go to the
[2:18:29] king praise the Lord but now here is the
[2:18:32] king having this great feast and now he
[2:18:34] want to he want to celebrate his victory
[2:18:37] he want he want to bring his wife the
[2:18:39] Bible says he want to show her faed his
[2:18:42] wife you must know he's already drunk so
[2:18:44] let's forget about that
[2:18:46] one
[2:18:48] now he's asking her to come at a time
[2:18:52] when she's not supposed to be in the
[2:18:53] chamber now she having all own thing
[2:18:55] going there even though it's it's going
[2:18:58] to show a a principle here it's going to
[2:19:01] show a principle and that's what we want
[2:19:03] to drive to now praise the
[2:19:06] Lord are we
[2:19:09] together so the king called vage and V
[2:19:14] refused to
[2:19:16] come that's the big word there she refus
[2:19:20] to
[2:19:21] come amen she refus to lead her women
[2:19:26] party and whatever she was doing to give
[2:19:28] herself now take this now take this uh h
[2:19:32] h h scholar bring us to this place or
[2:19:34] the name of God is not in this but you
[2:19:36] just take it in a shadow form this is a
[2:19:39] king and we have a
[2:19:42] king praise the Lord
[2:19:45] amen God Desiring to use you for a time
[2:19:49] and a purpose and you telling him that
[2:19:52] you are not ready yet you want God to
[2:19:54] come on your
[2:19:56] time you find many people when I stop
[2:19:59] doing this then I will serve God if I
[2:20:01] stop doing it then I will be serious you
[2:20:03] are just wasting your
[2:20:04] time amen you are just wasting your
[2:20:09] time the Bible says why today is called
[2:20:13] today when you hear the voice of God
[2:20:16] Harding not your heart if God is dealing
[2:20:20] with your heart no matter what the
[2:20:23] condition your life is in that's the
[2:20:25] best time to step in the water that's
[2:20:27] right that's the best time to say here
[2:20:29] am I Lord yes Lord
[2:20:32] amen praise the Lord because the things
[2:20:35] that you want to leave before you serve
[2:20:36] God you can never leave it if God don't
[2:20:38] take it away from your life yes
[2:20:43] amen the place you want to get to before
[2:20:45] you become serious you will never get
[2:20:47] there until God bring you
[2:20:54] there are we together now Providence
[2:20:58] have set this whole thing he called
[2:21:00] vases down into the
[2:21:02] feast praise the
[2:21:05] Lord amen amen he's carrying on this big
[2:21:08] Feast he's celebrating a victory before
[2:21:11] a wall that he's going to go in and uh
[2:21:14] uh uh you know and and and all of that
[2:21:16] and and and the scripture says she
[2:21:18] refus a refuser to the
[2:21:22] king a refuser to the
[2:21:26] king exterminated vases from the
[2:21:30] kingdom praise the
[2:21:32] Lord now see how the prophet of God
[2:21:35] would take that very same principle and
[2:21:38] apply it to the church
[2:21:39] ages whenever a church refus to move on
[2:21:43] with God God put them away
[2:21:48] M whenever a church refused to move on
[2:21:52] in the Revival when Luther came with a
[2:21:55] message of the judge shall live by faith
[2:21:58] and the people were just okay and
[2:22:00] satisfied to organize it God left them
[2:22:03] in their
[2:22:04] organization and pick up John
[2:22:09] Wesley when you refuse to move on with
[2:22:11] God because he moves the Bible says he
[2:22:15] the spirit of God what move upon the
[2:22:19] Water since God dropped to time he has
[2:22:22] never stand still he kept he keeps
[2:22:24] moving and even this morning he's moving
[2:22:28] right in this building he's moving am
[2:22:30] praise the Lord if you are ready to move
[2:22:33] on with god let's get Glory if you want
[2:22:35] to sit down enjoy your pleasure you sit
[2:22:40] back praise the Lord amen he said he can
[2:22:43] raise up stones to be children unto him
[2:22:51] amen when people make excuses in the bi
[2:22:54] in in the scripture oh they one say I
[2:22:56] just got married I'm not able to come
[2:22:57] the other one say I got a big farm the
[2:23:00] the Bible says he commanded them to go
[2:23:02] into the street and the
[2:23:07] byways praise the
[2:23:15] Lord now that's how Esther was brought
[2:23:19] into the kingom because of a
[2:23:23] refusal because of a
[2:23:28] refuser let's read this two and we'll
[2:23:31] find a place to close
[2:23:32] here brother will take this over in uh
[2:23:35] uh marriage of the Lamb it's a beautiful
[2:23:39] a very beautiful type there the king one
[2:23:42] of the greatest King in the word of that
[2:23:44] day he had a great feast and and he
[2:23:47] called the queen to come sit by him but
[2:23:50] she wouldn't do it she refused to do it
[2:23:54] so what did he do he was so humiliated
[2:24:00] he didn't know what to do that his own
[2:24:04] wife wouldn't come I think there's a
[2:24:07] whole
[2:24:08] lot like Christ
[2:24:10] today Christ has invited us to sit in
[2:24:15] Heavenly places with him and we are
[2:24:19] ashamed now take this what I I want to
[2:24:22] show you something that is that is
[2:24:24] Progressive here this was in 1962 that
[2:24:28] was when he he he preached his message
[2:24:32] 1962
[2:24:34] 1965 when he preached marriage and
[2:24:37] divorce he took the same thought but he
[2:24:40] took it in a complete different way now
[2:24:43] realize now the seals are open amen
[2:24:47] the seals are open follow me now and and
[2:24:51] and at the are the are the opening of
[2:24:54] the seal at the opening of the seal let
[2:24:56] me give you a setting here so you can
[2:24:58] you can be able to grab this as we as we
[2:25:01] progress with this thought at the
[2:25:02] opening of the
[2:25:06] seal the first thing that will happen is
[2:25:09] that uh uh uh he will he will he will
[2:25:13] dedicate a church they will do a
[2:25:15] dedication they will do a wedding You
[2:25:17] Preach God in
[2:25:18] Simplicity praise the Lord
[2:25:22] amen and uh uh he will start right there
[2:25:27] in gensing places the first seal he says
[2:25:30] now I call you
[2:25:33] Brian praise the Lord so the opening of
[2:25:37] the seal was actually the opening of the
[2:25:40] bridegroom's
[2:25:43] chamber it was now for the bride to come
[2:25:46] into the secret place yes of her
[2:25:49] bridegroom which is the mystery that was
[2:25:52] healing from the foundation of the
[2:25:55] world praise the Lord it was now where
[2:25:59] the church will move into more intimate
[2:26:03] with
[2:26:06] Christ we stop all of these boyfriend
[2:26:08] and girlfriend games one time you you
[2:26:10] are dead another time you are not dead
[2:26:12] you don't even know which way you going
[2:26:14] and and all of that no this will be
[2:26:17] a
[2:26:19] relationship this will be an intimate
[2:26:22] affair with Christ that's
[2:26:27] right that is a bride that have made
[2:26:29] herself
[2:26:31] ready praise the
[2:26:36] Lord are we together now watch now
[2:26:39] marriage of uh marriage and divorce I
[2:26:42] I'll try to close here now this this
[2:26:44] might be very small but just bear with
[2:26:46] me I try to read

[2:26:51] notes you can ask for the slideing and
[2:26:53] uh we will we'll give it to you praise
[2:26:54] the Lord now he says here the bride will
[2:26:58] have to be on adulterated the
[2:27:03] word not one word missing
[2:27:06] nowhere because this is marriage she's
[2:27:09] taking on the the bridegroom's name
[2:27:12] fully she has to be the
[2:27:15] word
[2:27:18] we have to be the word we have to dwell
[2:27:21] in the word
[2:27:23] yes that's what is all
[2:27:26] about it has to be the word we can never
[2:27:30] be able to bring forth Christ or the
[2:27:32] manifestation of Christ if we are just
[2:27:34] making it up it has to be the
[2:27:37] word are we together
[2:27:42] amen
[2:27:45] certainly
[2:27:48] now one word missing no word certainly
[2:27:50] could you imagine a correct BR one
[2:27:52] breast off and the other one somewhere
[2:27:55] else or or or or other wrong you know
[2:28:00] that's not going to be the bride of
[2:28:01] Christ she's perfect not in herself
[2:28:05] she's perfect in Christ She's Everything
[2:28:08] the word now one word fing any word
[2:28:14] no then he moved on he said
[2:28:17] notice he he can put her away but she
[2:28:22] cannot put him away now it all goes back
[2:28:26] now to that Providence that will bring
[2:28:28] Esther
[2:28:30] in Praise the Lord amen he's dealing
[2:28:34] with this whole marriage and divorce but
[2:28:36] he's bringing a
[2:28:39] message he's bringing a
[2:28:41] message and that's the message that that
[2:28:45] the bride want she want her
[2:28:47] responsibility praise the Lord now
[2:28:50] brother Brandon was preaching to people
[2:28:52] that make mistakes in their life make
[2:28:54] mistake in their marriages and he was
[2:28:56] bringing this subject of marriage and
[2:28:58] divorce which is a tough subject
[2:29:03] yeah praise the Lord but you see because
[2:29:07] there was a message there was there was
[2:29:09] a voice of God there was a message for
[2:29:11] the bride behind it that's what we need
[2:29:13] to get sometimes we get into all the
[2:29:16] first oh yeah he said this he said this
[2:29:18] he said but what is the message what is
[2:29:21] the message what was he trying to get to
[2:29:24] the
[2:29:25] bride let's take a little bit of
[2:29:29] it he did it and he proved it in the
[2:29:32] days when Luther Wesley and in Pentecost
[2:29:36] when they refused to become a f part of
[2:29:41] him by having spiritual sexual Affair To
[2:29:46] Be become pregnated now you see brother
[2:29:48] brandham is breaking that
[2:29:50] expression just like I said the opening
[2:29:54] of the seal open the bride chamber for
[2:29:57] the church to go into the fullness of
[2:30:00] Christ amen amen so right after the
[2:30:04] wedding what is expected for the woman
[2:30:06] to be pregnant right so he's he's
[2:30:09] bringing a
[2:30:10] l expression so we can be able to grab
[2:30:14] the weight
[2:30:17] praise the
[2:30:19] Lord that when the bride the marriage of
[2:30:22] the Lamb has come the bride have made
[2:30:24] her set ready the wedding has take place

[2:30:29] open it's no time for fussing
[2:30:33] yes praise the Lord are we
[2:30:38] together now so he's he's he's he's he's
[2:30:41] bringing that expression that's the same
[2:30:42] thing that happened to to to to to the
[2:30:45] Lutheran to Wesley the met the
[2:30:47] Pentecostal and all of that because they
[2:30:49] refus to become a further part of him by
[2:30:52] having spiritual sexual Affair to become
[2:30:55] pregnated with
[2:30:56] him with forther part of the word you
[2:31:00] understand she
[2:31:01] refused and Luther ref uh the Lutheran
[2:31:05] Church refused for Christ to have any
[2:31:08] more Desire with her they were they were
[2:31:10] okay to just staying with the jge shall
[2:31:12] by faith they never wanted to move into
[2:31:17] ification even the reformer Wesley
[2:31:21] Wesley was writing the thesis he said
[2:31:23] was struggling with
[2:31:24] pipe but God was bringing a message of
[2:31:28] sanctification to put away all the
[2:31:30] wordness clean our life from all all our
[2:31:35] mess because there was a further
[2:31:38] visitation of of the of the Holy Ghost
[2:31:40] on Pentecost that was going to engage
[2:31:42] the church to bring us to the opening of
[2:31:46] the SE
[2:31:47] amen but they refuse yes so what God did
[2:31:51] put them away raised up a John Wesley
[2:31:53] started a message of
[2:31:55] sanctification
[2:31:57] [Music]
[2:32:00] right praise the
[2:32:08] Lord the Lord TR refuse it and let me
[2:32:12] say this going to call me something
[2:32:14] anyhow it is the
[2:32:17] so it said today with every one of them
[2:32:20] they fail to take that word they refuse
[2:32:24] [Music]
[2:32:26] Christ and any woman that refuse a man
[2:32:30] his child has no right to be a wife to
[2:32:33] him amen now take take take their
[2:32:37] statement take it related to Christ
[2:32:42] that's right you know why I say related
[2:32:44] to Christ is
[2:32:46] because if you take it literally you
[2:32:49] will ruin your own life that's
[2:32:51] right praise the Lord When Rachel ask h
[2:32:56] h h h h Jacob and say give me children
[2:32:59] Jacob say am I
[2:33:02] God so that's why you can't take this
[2:33:04] literally and how many people have take
[2:33:07] this literally walk out of their home
[2:33:09] went into
[2:33:10] adulterate ruin their marriages why
[2:33:13] because you are not getting the message
[2:33:16] yeah you are not getting where this
[2:33:17] prophet of God is
[2:33:19] going you are using your counter mind
[2:33:23] wrap up with ftiness and you think the
[2:33:26] message is encouraging that that's not
[2:33:28] what he's
[2:33:35] preaching he's trying to to to allow us
[2:33:39] to see where we are as a church where we
[2:33:42] are as the bride of Christ when the
[2:33:45] scripture said the whole creation is
[2:33:47] waiting for the manifestation of the
[2:33:49] sons of God
[2:33:52] Amen the church must be producing little
[2:33:56] little
[2:33:57] maets people that are still loving
[2:34:00] fasting and praying people that are
[2:34:02] still loving reading the word seeking
[2:34:05] the face of
[2:34:08] God now five times snacking on the word
[2:34:11] I read the quot of the day I read my
[2:34:13] favorite Bible verse seek the face of
[2:34:15] God
[2:34:26] take it in your in your in your in your
[2:34:29] in your in your home your natural
[2:34:31] marriage if you're not spending time
[2:34:32] with your M you are destroying the
[2:34:36] home if you are so busy doing everything
[2:34:38] there is no time you can spend together
[2:34:40] our husand you are destroying your
[2:34:45] home
[2:34:47] that's why he's trying she's projecting
[2:34:52] here praise the
[2:34:55] Lord now you have to know I'm not angry
[2:34:58] with
[2:34:59] anybody I'm just
[2:35:04] excited praise the
[2:35:07] Lord but if you are angry with me please
[2:35:09] meet me out of church after church let's
[2:35:12] settle it amen amen God you remember is
[2:35:18] see where he's bringing it to now you
[2:35:19] remember in the Bible when the king
[2:35:22] mared Esther because the queen refused
[2:35:26] he's using that word refuse and let me
[2:35:29] let me let me just let me just let me
[2:35:31] just go in this area a little bit I was
[2:35:33] down in South Africa this going December
[2:35:35] and I pray one night I I I had a thought
[2:35:38] on my mind and and but but I was
[2:35:40] preaching to that group for the first
[2:35:41] time I had to hold myself back and say
[2:35:43] no Lord uh uh uh yeah
[2:35:46] if if this is what really you want me to
[2:35:48] preach this is my first time with these
[2:35:50] people but I I I was break I was break
[2:35:52] into this thought where and I really
[2:35:54] wanted to use it for the Youth because I
[2:35:56] wanted to bring out word right from from
[2:36:00] from Genesis Genesis chapter
[2:36:03] 3 asaiah said no weapon form against us
[2:36:08] shall prosper amen the first weapon that
[2:36:13] was ever used on mankind
[2:36:16] was their own
[2:36:21] body the first weapon that was ever used
[2:36:25] on
[2:36:26] mankind was their own
[2:36:28] body the first physical weapon the
[2:36:31] spiritual weapon that the devil used was
[2:36:33] a lie
[2:36:36] right but lie conditioned their body for
[2:36:40] them to abuse themselves from the
[2:36:43] Holiness of God
[2:36:46] praise the Lord amen
[2:36:49] amen that's the reason why since that
[2:36:53] time sex has been a
[2:36:56] weapon let me say
[2:37:00] it because it was the devil's successful
[2:37:04] weapon to bring mankind into his
[2:37:11] field and he knows that he can get your
[2:37:15] mind
[2:37:16] dad by that he knows that he can destroy
[2:37:21] your body by that he knows that he can
[2:37:23] ruin your home when you make your body a
[2:37:32] weapon praise the
[2:37:37] Lord are you following
[2:37:44] me and he also know
[2:37:49] that he can also make your body a weapon
[2:37:52] to destroy God's
[2:37:57] purpose when he when he condition our
[2:38:01] desire to strive for ungodliness and
[2:38:06] uncleanness the moment the desire is
[2:38:09] Twist the same body that can desire
[2:38:12] prayer and desire to you know to serve
[2:38:15] God desire the best to stand for God
[2:38:17] word trying our best to say the truth
[2:38:19] and do what is right that same body when
[2:38:22] that desire is Twisted it become a
[2:38:25] weapon in the hands of God we can use
[2:38:28] our mind to imagine evil use our tongue
[2:38:31] to talk lie destroy people and and and
[2:38:34] all of
[2:38:42] that now but this prophet of God was
[2:38:44] going more prophetic
[2:38:47] he was dealing with the church he was
[2:38:49] bringing the church to a
[2:38:52] position that when you refuse when you
[2:38:56] refuse Christ your
[2:38:59] husband he has a right to put you away
[2:39:03] put you on the Shelf where you only have
[2:39:05] the form of godliness and you can never
[2:39:08] have the power to rise up as a Son of
[2:39:13] God Amen that's why
[2:39:16] that's that's where he's bringing us to
[2:39:30] yes now if we were having a couple
[2:39:32] retreat I will have gone much into that
[2:39:34] but I'll leave it for
[2:39:37] now amen I'll leave it for now until
[2:39:40] until we have our couple time to
[2:39:43] talk let me just stay with this uh
[2:39:46] prophecy of of the
[2:39:48] Prophet what happened when she refused
[2:39:51] to come out with the King to obey him
[2:39:55] the same thing is with a woman that
[2:39:57] refused to be a wife to her
[2:40:00] husband and so is it with the church
[2:40:03] that
[2:40:04] refuse to
[2:40:06] come to refuse to be Cal pregnated in
[2:40:12] the age that we now live in to bring
[2:40:15] forth Children of the
[2:40:18] age it's not it's not a physical
[2:40:21] pregnancy it's a spiritual pregnancy
[2:40:24] just like Peter would say if these
[2:40:27] things are in you you will not be
[2:40:30] Barren if you have the virtues in you
[2:40:33] you will not be baren but you will bring
[2:40:35] forth manifestation amen
[2:40:38] am yes
[2:40:43] amen he will control your Tong if
