Lord we pray that the Lord would Grant him traveling mercy and go before him go with you and keep you in everything that you will be doing praise the Lord amen and uh uh thank you musicians thank you let me keep you uh in uh the tape that was that was played the beginning and the ending of the Gentile dispensation uh we end that tip this morning in our uh Sunday school tape session I want to refer to something that uh uh BR Brandon used to close their tip close that message this morning just want to do a review on something and uh uh I catch catch up with there before we go into what we want to talk about this morning like I said you know if you had a privilege to to listen to the tape uh why it was playing uh you listen to it privately uh but uh there there are some few reason why we we ask that we we play there for the Sunday school so let me just go over some few things as he close the the the message so uh if we can uh ask I will take people to just put up that one quot I think that was one of the last thing he said uh it caught my mind and uh I just want to go over some few things yeah the beginning and the ending of the Gentile dispensation he says uh at that time he's uh reading from uh uh he's reading from uh um Daniel so there is something there I want for us to see let's go to Daniel chapter 12 let's go to Daniel chapter 12 there parallel something that uh I want us look at Daniel chapter 12 praise the Lord now when he when he he he quoted that that was Daniel 12:1 at that time shall Mel stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and uh uh thy people speaking to Daniel which is Daniel people and uh and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time that people shall be delivered every one of them there shall be found written in the book praise the Lord so at that time Michel shall stand up now so let's go back to that quote and uh uh he says at that time reading from beginning end of gentle dispensation at that time Michael shall stand the great Prince now Michael was Christ of course who fought the Angelic war in heaven with the devil Satan and Michael fought together uh uh uh Isaiah chapter 14 tells us that and then also Jude in the book of Jude just before the The Book of Revelation Jude tell told us also that Mel fought for the body of Moses now here Daniel is uh is uh seeing uh in his in his vision uh uh uh here he's he's testifying once once again Michel will stand for his people which of course the the his people in the definite sense is the Jews in the general sense is the redeemed praise the Lord are we together and uh so uh M was Christ who fought the Angelic war in heaven the devil Satan and Michel fought together so fought against each other and at that day Michael shall stand for the people he end standing for the Nations he's standing for the people and many of those that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall shall rise to Everlasting shame and contempt and those that be wise and turn many to righteousness shall shine as the Stars forever and ever now back again to uh Daniel chapter 12 I want to look at something that looks very familiar very familiar and uh uh uh let's look at that together Daniel chapter 12 back let's look at verse 4 let's look at Daniel chapter 12 verse4 praise the Lord and thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the even to the time of their end many shall run to and forth knowledge shall increase praise the Lord now I say it sound very familiar because if you read Revelation chap 10 verse 4 this is Daniel chapter 10 verse 4 we have just read you read Revelation chap 10 verse4 you hear the same thing verse four says and uh and when the seven tunders have altered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven tunder alter and write them net praise the Lord now so uh uh uh here in Daniel chapter 4 Daniel I mean chapter 12:4 Daniel is told to shut up the book is the same word that is used in Revelation seal those things shut up the book seal those things uh is the same thing now so what the parallel that I want us to see here is that is for us to understand what is is taking place here in in the Book of Daniel we realize that uh uh uh we we we talk about the image that was given to Nebuchadnezzar in his dream that Daniel had to interpret and that and and that image represent the Gentile kingdoms but then God is also giving to Daniel uh uh a Sevenfold purpose okay he giv to Daniel uh uh uh also the Myster of the Jews Redemption so he's revealing things to Daniel and he's telling Daniel shut up those things seal them for the time of the end praise the Lord there is another thing that comes very familiar also uh uh in the Book of Daniel we look at the ceiling of the book and uh let's let's continue to read Daniel chapter 12 let's get down to verse 7 now to take uh uh Mar of the time just to be able to highlight some few things here and I heard a man clothed in leaning which which was upon the the the Waters of the river when he held up his hands he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swore by him that liveth forever that it shall be for a time times and and half time 1 * 2 and a half 3 and A2 years the three and a half years that is left for the Jews that's where that's where that brother brandham took that from time one times which mean two now one two but one one one and a half so three and a half years so but but just just watch what I want to show you yeah I'm not going into that uh uh uh I'm showing you yet that this Angel he lift up his right hand and his left hand onto heaven and he sore by him that liveth forever that it shall be for a time one year times two years so 1 + 2 3 and and half and when he shall have accomplished to settle the power of the Holy people all these things shall be finished back to revelation Revelation chap 10 and then when you go over to uh uh uh we read verse [Music] four verse five verse five and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hands to heaven and he swore by himself forever and ever I mean he swore by him that liveth forever and ever who created the heavens and the things that are dead in the earth and the things okay they have it up there and the things there therein are and the see and the things which are therein that there shall be time no longer are you seeing the similarity here praise the Lord amen are you seeing the similarity now down here there are things that are revealed to Daniel and the angels tell him shut the book these things are kept for the end they will be revealed in the end praise the Lord and I said the angels are revealing things also to John on the island of pmos and he tell John see the book since I'm I'm I'm I'm showing to you see the book write them there at in in the beginning in Revelation chapter one he told John right in Revelation chapter 10 he says write this one that I I I I don't want to get into that but the the the the the similari is the parallel there's a parallel here I want to show you is that Daniel was told to shut the book John was told to sh shut the book Daniel was first told to write the vision John was told to write the vision now Daniel is told to shut the book John is told also to shut the book but Daniel is having an angel that identified himself as Michael praise the Lord amen in Revelation chapter 10 John is having an angel that is called the mighty Angel sir they are not too different they are the same amen Christ delivering the Jews Christ delivering the Gentiles are we together praise the Lord now I will tell you why I'm going over these things what I'm taking my time to pick up these things bid in pieces because this is our our message yes what we call the message of the hour is not dress Cod no is the mystress of God revealed am praise the Lord amen amen now so we see to uh uh to uh the uh to the okay help me now let me get my thought to the Jews to the Jews he's uh Michael the one that would deliver them you remember when uh when Gabriel was bringing Daniel request Daniel prayer the Prince of Persia with stood the amen came to his defense praise the Lord where we are where we are Church it is almost like we are on my camel and we are we are just like Gesa we are seeing the things that are coming against us but we don't see the forces that are standing for usah Hallelujah we are seeing the things that are coming against us we can complain about them we can say yeah this happening oh my this one happening but we are not seeing the things that are standing for us he says Michel will stand for his people I'm only telling you there's an angel standing for you in this day Hallelujah there's an angel that is standing for you in this day no matter what you are going through if it is to kill you long time you've been dead the reason why you are alive because there is an angel that is standing in your defense praise the Lord what was about what was I about to say now so this Angel we see this same Angel for for for for ding for the Jews he's standing with his hand raised to heaven and he sore by him that liveth forever and ever the one that make the heavens the Earth the sea everything that is inside he lift his hand up and he sore the same God that brought Abraham down in Genesis chapter 15 and he swore by himself now your see peace I show John in The Strange Land and I will bring them up with a mighty hands it's the same God that is standing for the Jews in Daniel chapter 12 with his hand lifted up and he's swearing that everything I have wrting concerning you I will bring it to pass there is no devil in hell that is going to stop it Revelation chapter 10 we see this the same Mighty injured again standing with his hand raised to heaven but watch what is different here there is something that is different to the Jews when he raised his hand to Heaven he said for a Time Time a time times and a half all these things will be accomplished for the Gentile when he raised his hand to Heaven he said time is no more okay people we are not following coning devis feeble we are not following the the thoughts of William Brandon We are following the word of the Living God amen amen We are following the word of the Living God we are grateful we are grateful that the message F Us Praise the Lord if God did not send a prophet we would not be saying this we would not be ignoring this amen so you can see the Plan of Redemption for the Jews was given to Daniel The Plan of Redemption for the Gentiles was given to the the the messenger of the seventh Church age but the mystery of of of the Plan of Redemption the mystery the entire mystery was supposed to be open in the last day God gave the plan to Daniel and that's where he has all of these uh uh uh uh uh uh uh things there in the in the in the Daniel 7th week praise the Lord so as I was listening to the message this morning uh as we were playing it there and I heard brother brandham said there uh there are there are some few things I've written down couple of time ago go yeah I think I've already gone over there so let me not take all of all of the time so I I just thought that I will I will try to cap this out maybe if you didn't pay attention to that then you can go back and listen to it again every time you listen to the word you pick up something praise the Lord all I'm doing I'm just encouraging you to listen to the voice of the messenger that's all I'm doing that's all I'm doing praise the Lord so we thank the Lord for that amen we thank the Lord and uh uh the Lord help us here we will we'll find time and be able to go through all of these things for you but I just wanted to point those things out to you so you can see it because that's where we are you know gah saw the searings he could hear the cheros he could see the dust that were coming you know he was he was in fear and Terror and and and that's and and that's that's that's the place where we are you know we are doing our best to serve God but we are afraid because it looks like we don't have control of many things around us praise the Lord but that Prophet Elijah knew exactly where he was standing he knew where he was standing and he could he could see the fear he could sense the fear on U on this young man and he said Lord open his eyes praise the Lord open his eyes and may God open our eyes for us to see the host of angels that are in come about us praise the Lord the things that you are thinking about you are worrying about they are more concerned to God than you praise the Lord you don't have no repetition that is on the line than the repetition of almighty God praise the Lord amen may he open our eyes may he open our our hearts to believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever let's Stand Together praise the Lord amen amen St John chapter 15 St John chapter 15 St John chapter 15 so John chapter 15 let's read from verse one to verse 7 I am the the true V and my hus my father is the husband man pay attention here brother War every branch in me that bear that fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he parted it that it may bring forth more fruit now yeah I cllean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it a bad in in the vine so uh in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing praise the Lord if a man a bad n in mean he is cast forth as a branch and is weather and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me praise the Lord and my word abide in you praise the Lord ye shall ask what ye will praise the Lord and it shall be done unto you praise the Lord if ye abide in me praise the Lord Lord and my word abide in you praise the Lord ye shall ask what ye will praise the Lord and it shall be done unto you praise the Lord amen 1 John Chapter 2 1 John Chapter 2 we stay in our our beginning series we are in our beginning series 1 John Chapter 2 let's read verse 24 and verse 25 last week I I pointed to this that I was going to take uh uh I was going to take this verse 24 and 25 let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the Sun and in the father and this is the promise that I have prom that that he have promised us even eternal life so John is saying abiding in the word and the word abiding in you is the promise of eternal life praise the Lord not beginning the race is not to the S let me tell you the rules of this race is finishing well that the name of this race not not impressing in the way you are starting the name of the the race is finishing well that's the reason why when we finish he says well done because it's all about finishing well let's pray together father we are very grateful this morning thank you for your presence thank you Father Lord and we are committing ourself in your hands there's one thing Lord God that uh uh our our interest our focus is to you Lord is that father you will come out of the pages of your word make yourself real unto us oh God we pray that father you will break your word to our hearts speak to us Lord in a way that father our soul will understand because Lord if we can grab the word if our father Lord G we can grab the vision if we can understand what you are doing with our life we can rest in you so we pray that dear God you would come now speak to us we love love you we appreciate you father in in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so John is saying the promise of eternal life is abide in the word and let the word abide in you amen that is the promise of eternal life praise the Lord now okay if we can do our our slide I think I still have this fancy thing in my hands praise the Lord they say I should be able to go back and forth with it okay maybe they're getting it ready back there for me okay did I did that body in what you have heard from the beginning that's uh okay good okay please I'm trying to learn how to use this okay let me show you something here also we want to look at this together James said who whosoever shall keep the the the whole Lord and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all I was thinking about that but uh I I find a good picture there something I was thinking about in my mind there was something that brought this whole thing to to to to mind and that's what I want to share with you and uh uh but if you look you see what James said here here how can I say it you you will see that uh James inspiration was also fulfilled in the life of the lawgiver watch this now in Exodus chap 32: 19 okay Moses is coming down from the mountain when he when he came down from the mountain he met the people worshiping an idol he fell offended and he broke the Ten Commandments James said whosoever shall keep the whole law Moses was holding the whole law The Ten Commandments he was keeping it bringing it to the people and yet of in one point when he got there he fell offended so he broke the whole Lord and you see in the picture in another sense James is referring to even the one that brought the Commandment in the Commandment it is said that do not worship any graving image Moses had that he was keeping the whole law the Ten Commandments in his hands praise the Lord when he got down to the mountain he found the people worshiping an idol he got offended at that and then he broke the Ten Commandments praise the Lord are you seeing the picture but what brought my mind today is now to teach you on the Ten Commandments I think you learned that in Sunday School but Moses the lawgiver he brought us Ten Commandments he brought us Ten Commandments and Jesus the prophet like unto Moses amen when he came down on Mount Olive he brought us 10 Beatitudes praise the Lord watch now when the Ten Commandments were given to the children of Israel we spoke about that uh uh it was it was the people saying to Moses all that the Lord said we will do so the desire Lord but when Jesus came he brought 10 Beatitudes that he gave to his disciple blessed uh the the the me blessed he gave them all all this all this blessed praise the Lord and uh uh if you if you if you watch it you realize that in another sense Jesus was telling them honor the law the word was given to you as a law as a burden but those very words that was given to you now I say unto you that was the very same time he said that you were told that an eye for an eye but now I say unto you whosoever hat a brother without a curse praise the Lord so Jesus now was trying to bring to us what Moses brought as a Lord with burden he's bringing it to us with a blessing praise the Lord amen there is not a burden it's a blessing blessed are the meek blessed are those that suffer persecution for my name's sake blessed are the poor in spirit blessed out of that but actually you will realize that if you go through Matthew Chapter 5 from uh verse 1 to 12 you're going to find only nine Beatitudes praise the Lord the 10th beatitude is in Matthew chapter 11 you remember brother Brandon preached the forgotten beatitude that was where Jesus told John blessed is he that is not offended in me that's right praise the Lord where are we going with this in Revelation last week we were talking about all the Sant that John saw in Revelation in Revelation John also saw seven Beatitudes John spoke about blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the word of this prophecy so there's a blessing in hearing the word or reading it so if you can read it please play in your car amen yes sir don't let the devil to R you of that blessing he speaks about blessed at the dead which died in the Lord henceforth amen why because because Paradise is no longer under the influence of the devil so blessed are they that die in the law henceforth when we die we go in the sixth Dimension we go under the altar are we together blessed is he that watch and keepeth His Garment least he walk naked and they see his shame blessed are they which I called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb blessed and holy is he that have that that that that have part in the first resurrection which is the rapture right are we together behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the saying of the prophecy of this book and and blessed are they that do his Commandments are we together amen so I I don't know how I how I find it but it's just all the seven they keep popping up praise the Lord I just thought I should share that with you amen now we want to talk about this this uh promise of internal life abiding in the word abiding in what ye have heard from the beginning the word abiding means to remain in to continue uh uh to preserve in anything a state of mind to hold fast to be truth to abide by to keep and uh uh uh I think I took that either one one from the other I think the upper one was from uh uh the the Greek concordance this one is from the Hebrew concordance to stand to remain to endal take one's stand to stand take one stand to be to be to to be in EXT standing attitude stand for Take A Stand Paul in the book of Hebrew I mean uh uh Ephesians says when you have put on all the armor of God then stand amen praise the Lord so we want to talk about that the abiding now before I go into that I want to share something with you and uh uh uh uh when we do these PowerPoints like that they don't come out much clearer back there than they come up yet so I'm going to be turning this way now so uh H uh I thought about this and I thought that I would share this with you before I continue brother Bram says here in the Ephesian Church age yeah yeah it is in G 81 praise the Lord are we together amen amen but thou uh but do we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which ye have that which we have already preached unto you let him be a curse it was the Apostle who brought the original word of the Gospel that's Paul that original word could not be changed not even a DOT or a dash of eight Jesus also said it now now the TT you know could be alter Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said even if I come and try to give a second Revelation try to make one little change in what I have originally let me be a curse you see Paul knew that he knew that first revelation was correct God K gave a first revelation then a second Revelation explain that he came give a first revelation in the second Revelation means that God is not learning better okay he's not learning better to say uh yesterday I told you this but today you know I I I think I understand it better okay no he's he's now learning he is the W he is the Fountain of all wisdom of all knowledge praise the Lord so he cannot give a first revelation on a subject and gave a better Revelation on that same subject that's what I want to make my emphasis on he gave a revelation anything that come s is just informational and we living in such a time where people take information as Revelation and you hear it all over the place well the Lord revealed this to me the Lord revealed this to me in in Biblical context Revelation only comes to the prophet the Lord God speaks to the prophet I don't have a revelation every everything I'm bringing to you is just information on a subject I'm using the word to give you more information on a subject I don't have a revelation no preacher have a revelation the Lord God speaks to his Prophet are we together can the church say amen amen am I making you afraid oh well praise the Lord I want to set you free amen you see that's the reason why all the gifts comes back to the word my gift is judged by the word you have a dream bring it back to the word you think God speaks to you bring it back to the word if it does not fit in the word it's not good for you it's not good for you don't make a name for yourself that name will take you to hell if it does not fit in the word leave it all of those things are is the spirit of thee you have to realize that that the loudish age is the P the the the the the the Church of the loudish age is the Pentecostal church amen the voice of Revelation 4 has called us out of the laisha edge we have come out of the edge spiritually naturally we stay in the age so sometimes those things of the age affect us you hear that you hear it among people God revealed this to me the Lord revealed this to me brother I got a revelation I was reading yesterday iord Revelation you just got a better understanding you don't have a revelation you don't have a revelation let's read let's let's continue to read God can't give a first revelation then the second Revelation if he did he will be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed of the woman and then later uh uh destinated that sea had to come through Abraham amen so when he to spoke to Abraham what did he says your seed will possess the gates is that same seed that he spoke about in Genesis chapter 15 The Seed of the woman that's the reason why the seed is not a natural seed it's a spiritual seed so it move in progression it keep progressing are we together Amen Let me let's let's look at something else I might never get to what I want to preach but it's okay well let's uh let's let's continue to read let's continue to read it might it might take me into a complete different direction but let's continue to read here if he did that he will be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later destinated that seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it will come by the same blood line of David you see that's the reason why if you remember when we were talking about bypassing the curse because the the the seed that's that's if if if you watch brother Bram will always says when uh when uh uh when when Satan got the Hebrew boys in the fire he thought he got the seed he says I got them amen praise the Lord because in in his mind he was he was he was looking for a natural seed he was also following you know he was following he was watching their promise are we together now so uh uh uh and and and and and when we were talking about that God came and and brought the promise down to to to David and said David I will give you a seed with an everlasting Kingdom I sure that God set sat on attention an everlasting Kingdom so I have to follow the seed of David but you see there in jeconiah when God curs th sea line of David that this man will have no CH then how would David now have an everlasting Throne you see but God in keeping his word he had to B pass that sea line and and and give Israel a promise that the Virgin shall conceive you see so it is not a new revelation it might look like new it had never happened before a virgin has never it's not a new revelation because back in Genesis he said the woman will have a seed so it's not a new uh it's not a new revelation it's just a progression the same way we progress in our understanding we used to believe a a trinity Doctrine we don't believe that anymore right are we together amen I'm hoping it's making sense to you and little said it will come by the same bloodline in David but but it was the same Revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it praise the Lord am it only gave them more information to help them to receive and understand it praise the lord it's almost like the word why God have a fivefold Ministry just to give us different style of presentation it's the same word it's the same word the gifts are just designed to make you to look at it like this and look at the same way you go shopping you are looking at the thing all over look at it look that that's just all you doing it's just for you to be able to look at every angle of the word praise the Lord if a man thinks that he's bringing H uh his own Revelation glory be to God we don't need it amen we don't need it he says it's the same Revelation it only gives the people more information to help them receive it and understand it you see sometimes those things bother the local church because I'm your pastor you get you get uh uh uh uh used to understanding the way I present the word uh uh uh and then a brother will come and say something sometimes if he don't use my exact words a a a TR he said it was the same chuban that Ezekiel Saw he said it was the same chuban that aah saw when Isaiah said their train filled their Temple he said they were moving so fast that like they were moving like train he said in in Revelation H H chapter 4 it was the same cherubin that John saw but they were all looking at it from different position he said the chuban was given to protect the church so those those cherubin dwell with the church in all of their Journey Moses saw the in the Garden of Eden protecting the Tree of Life when John saw it in the Book of Revelation the church has already arrived home that's right praise the Lord amen because those things uh you know sometimes on on little information people create a certain line of belief and then and then they bring they bring forces among the people praise the Lord and it says that's my Revelation you if it is your Revelation I don't want it the reason why I don't want it because you are not a prophet that's are we together now so look here also as we read he says uh uh uh but the same Revelation it only gives the people more information to help them receive and understand it but God word can change this the seed came exactly as revealed Hallelujah get back to the [Music] word it's not you that really try the apostles or the prophets or the teacher it is the word that try them are we together amen it's it's it's almost like uh you talk about uh uh having more information to help them receive and understand uh uh uh is it's it's it's almost like inspiration praise the Lord are we together so I wanted to I wanted to make sure that uh I bring this to you so uh uh we can we can be able to appreciate the word amen we can be able to appreciate the word uh I show this to you over in the book of Deuteronomy where the uh when Moses was instructing the children of Israel he says if a man he says if a man steal an ox or he say steal a sheep a man the man and the man is caught stealing the Sheep he must Resto the sheep for forth amen he stole one he should repay back four times that's what Moses said Moses was the proph Prophet amen now naon will use that very same thing to David when Nathan went to David he built a story what was that an inspiration he took what the prophet Moses said and he buil an inspiration to be able to help deliver David if he have gone to David house and said David you you have just killed a person amen you have committed adultery you know the Lord showed me last night I saw you I saw you and B he went to David he said David we have a problem we have a very poor man that have only one lamb and there's a wealthy gu in this time that went and took their poor man lamb praise the Lord all he was using was what Moses said yeah just what Moses said David says what honor my rulership the man that have done that the man should die Nathan says you are the man but you are not going to die why because I caught you right-handed M by a vision I CAU you on Vision so you're going to restore it four times go back to to 1 Samuel or 2 Samuel the story you realize Nathan told David four things that will happen in his house praise the Lord amen you you remember the story the brother Ben B Woods when his brother you know he told his brother that about brother Brandon those guys were were Jehovah Witness told his brother about brother Brandon and uh you know and and and and and uh his brother came to see brother Bram you know he says uh you know this guy he's he's reading people mind in order of that and the law showed brother brother Brandon that brother Ben who's brother had just committed adultery amen so he he told him he says he says he says sir what's about last night it was good you went through the window that man will have blow your brain off he knew his brother did not know what he did praise the Lord he knew that his brother could not tell brother Brandon that because his brother never knew what he did but said it was good you went through the window that guy will have blow your brain off it was easy for him to surrounder his life this man that know my secret they think I just did last night are we together so Nathan is telling David I caught you right-handed and by the word of God the the word never said when you catch the man you should kill him the word say if you catch him he should restore four times so David this is going to happen to you this is going to happen to you this is going to happen to you this is going to happen to you so you see it's just one [Music] Revelation every other thing that comes is just information or inspiration whichever way you want to call it well let's get into our subject we almost out of time praise the Lord are we together am okay this thing need to work praise the Lord now so we will we will what we want to talk about here is uh is uh abiding John said ye abide in what ye have heard from the beginning and Jes Jesus here is uh is is is is telling us in in in St John chapter 15 like I like I said last week when when when Jesus was saying that he was preaching to his disciple I am the vine ye are the branches you know abide in in in me and I in you you know it's it's it's the same way it's the same way people come they sit around the message it just looks like you're talking more more about brother Brandon than Jesus Christ that's how it might sound to you amen but you read right in your Bible there in the book of as the Bible says when uh uh H the Bible says and Moses was read in the synagogues every Sabbath there is no book in the Bible called Moses and I believe the same thing that these disciples as they sat on Jesus ministry the they all T this guy is all abide in me and I abide in you I I he keep using this thing praise the Lord but when John went to the island of pmos after the Holy Ghost has come the Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit started to bring back to their to their Memories the things that g the Holy Spirit starts to make the thing make the world real to them amen Jesus told him now I wash your feet you don't know what I'm doing you wash one another feet he said but you will know from here on praise the Lord and Paul comes in the book of Ephesian he tells us that we are watched by the watching of the Water by the word so what Jesus did to them in in in a literal form and and and establish an ordinance for the church it is what the word of God does to us every time we come to service we come for a feet washing how we can walk right how we can stand on the Promises of God right are we together so Jesus is telling them I am the vine ye are the branches abide in me now John will come from the island of the pmos and he will be using that very same statement AB in what ye have heard from the beginning trying to show us our our our place of worship amen our place of worship we are not we are not coming together to come into good sh church we are coming into Christ we are coming to abide in the word are we together so we have just read that is our promise of eternal life when we abide in the word the promise of eternal life is to stay in the word you will realize that is actually the power that we have I was just telling the brother during the week we were you know talking with a friend back there from Ghana fellowshipping together I was telling this brother I says you know when when when when you you you think about it Jesus says I will give you power and the human mind we we we we we think about exercise we think about muscle we think about you know what physical strength no but God power is in his word amen it's the word that gives us the power to resist the lust of the word it's the word that gives us the power to stand for Christ to stand for righteousness so actually the power to the church is a power of endurance a power that can make you to endure praise the Lord amen if it was if it was based on our physical strength we will be finished praise the Lord you find people believing God for their healing they're going through things in their body you know where pains and different thing they are holding on to the promise of God they keep praising God they keep serving God where are they getting the strength from when their physical body is falling apart it's the word that is keeping them together praise the Lord even sometimes our young people they don't even understand what they are going through their mind is all the devil is just blasting their mind with different thing they are going through different things in their body and all of that the the feet discouraged the feet condemned but yet there is there is there there is a hope that drops in their heart they want to get back to church they want to come into the fellowship what is that is that endurance power it's not your strength it's not your knowledge it's not your mental conception that's why Jesus said I will give you power when the Holy Ghost comes upon you he said I will drop something in your soul something that will be able to keep you in a time of [Applause] trial raes now to the Swift praise the Lord neither neither is not to the one that impress but to the one that endure he that endureth unto the end Jesus said the same shall be saved praise the Lord while they are running I would drag I'm looking at the Finish Line Lord give me Grace oh Lord Jesus I love you I thank you Father praise the Lord are we together listen to what this prophet of God said here come on technicians let's go to the next quote there faith is a substance good and the Very god listen to this now beautiful the very God back there in the beginning that R the word the moon the stars and made them from things which do not appear all made them out of things which do appear amen or where did he get the material to make it he spoke it into existence by his word he said Let There Be and there was deity and that a portion of that deity dwells in the heart of every born again Christian that's what we call predestinated seed a portion of that deity a portion of that word Dell in the heart of every born again Christian praise the Lord that's the reason why if that word is dwelling in your heart your body might go through things amen but the word has the keeping power when thou word starts to take a hold of you oh my God your your mind just get confused and that's why you find people you know uh coming back to the Lord and and they are just regretting why because now their mind is conscious of all the foolish thing they did thinking that they could do that thing and they will you know they will not serve God anymore I'm tired of serving God and you're just wasting your time God made you you didn't make God a portion of that deity dwells in the heart of every born again Christian Hallelujah then what did he said ask what you will and it will be given to you there you are what is brother Bram saying if deity said let there be and there was and a portion of that deity is in you and deity said child it's your time to ask when I ask I said let there be there was a portion of it is in you ask what you will amen there you are deity it fell on the date of Pentecost it still falling hallelujah amen anden are regenerated made a new person sealed into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost The Life of Christ pressing into them all their drinking and imoral habit and everything goes out de pressing into US amen that's some that's some of the thing that makes us nervous because deity is pressing into us hallelujah sometimes you know yourself you just want to misbehave but deity is pressing in GL Hallelujah if you had abide in me and I abide in you amen Brown says also yet he says I have give you everything whatsoever thing you desire When you pray believe you receive it you shall have it whatever you ask in the ask the father in my name that I will do l i i Am With You Always even to the end of the word the things that I do shall you also y said again if ye Abad oh I like that word Abad not run here or run there run here or run there no about stay with the word we are not following a man no we are following the word amen whenever when you hear the the the manifestation of the sons of God let me let me let me explain it to you like this St John chapter 1 John said in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the word of God put on flesh and came and dwelt Among Us so what he's saying is that whenever the logos take on the flesh is is the manifestation of the son is the manifestation of the Son of God praise the Lord David saw Goliath challenging that young young boy he got there in a camp taking some food for his brothers and he he says he says what is this noise this man challenging the army of the Living God praise the Lord amen knowing that the prophet Samuel had just anointed him couple of days ago a couple of weeks ago a couple of months ago whatever time it was but he was anointed by a prophet amen so he was he was already under the anointing of the word he was already honor the anointing of the word because he was honor a promise to become a king of Israel and here he comes and meets a challenge praise the Lord the moment he open his heart and he says no way no way I can't sit down here for an unsec concised Philistine to challenge the army of the the Lord God says that's the one I want the Lord God just pick up that flesh praise the Lord you see that in your in your own life there are times where you stand for the word you say no you just get a strength praise the lord and there are times where you reason you reason you reason you reason and you don't get the strength is because you did not open that channel whenever you open the channel the logos come and pick up your flesh praise the Lord that is the same reason why Sam S could pick up a a a gate on his shoulder Sam could tear a lion apart Sam could k the Philistines but the day where he closed the channel and allowed thead to cut his head his eyes were taken out he didn't not have the strength again because it is not you it is when that channel is open that the logos comes down and pick up your body you say Lord I'm weak but you are strong so when we talk about the manifestation of the sons of God it's not a clap where you got got to John it's the manifestation of the son let's go let's no no no no it's Sons and Daughters of God submitting thems to God body mean y said if you're about mean I like the word about now run yeah now run there run yeah run there no uh but if you abide in me and my word abide in you ask what you will and it will be given to you right if you abide in me I like the abiding Church don't you constantly abiding Jesus is mine you sing the oh him God God has promised it it's ours every man and woman in year has a right right now to claim your healing whether it's healing you want whether it's Deliverance you want what whatever you want you have a right all you have to do is just surrounder get away from your thought let the logos come and pick up your body the thing that looks difficult for you you will overcome it oh glory be to God hallelujah birth pains he says a woman is a part of her husband sorry okay a woman is a part of her husband taken from him so is the church so the church will have to be a word abiding church we will never make a successful Church by just looking for game let's do something so so people can come the way you bring the people you bring that bunch of trouble the way they will come the how they will go Hallelujah Jesus said I will build my church he didn't say make church for me he said I will build my church and what he's using to build his church is his word he's looking for word abiding people thank you Lord every word of the Bible not system not Dogma or nothing added to it it has to be an unadulterated pure virgin word are we to are we together praise the Lord if hear about it mean not go out from behind the curtain into the word he's using the New Testament Tabernacle that was where the Shak kind of Glory was that was where the Shak of Glory was if you AB body me now go out from behind the curtains and into the word and run around and try and and and try to get back into the curtain tonight if it abide in me my word abide in you otherwise if you are like Aaron rod that's pull up to the shakana Glory by the golden part of man and word you can eat at any time that that that steak that was cut off an armor tree Aaron had in his hands when the Tabernacle was built that day Ste was put in the shakana glory it beginning it begin to to P for burbs a d stick came back to life why because it was abiding in the presence of the lifegiver abiding in the presence of the lifegiver no matter what we are that's why God says to Ezekiel can this bone live again said Lord do I know praise the Lord God say you have the word you have the word that's what I'm asking you can this bone left do you know what you have in your hands Ezekiel do you know what you have you over the valley of Bones you have this word God said just prophesy speak the word hallelujah they are already dead bone they can't move anywhere you don't have to worry they will not go as long as they say as they stay there just keep saying the same thing over them live live live live they abiding in the valley just keep prophesying on them sen Flesh Blood vessels come to life praise the Lord soon Ezekiel starts start hearing a rolling in the valley and B start jumping over bones they start looking for the identification the hair start running to the neck and and they say no you don't belong here go down here that's your identity there praise the Lord like Aaron Rod pulled up in the shakana Glory by the golden part of man word you can eat at any time and your soul is refreshed and blooming and yelling in me and I word AB in you then ask what you will I will give it to you amen see brother BR says he he says you see the filling of the church when he says the Pentecostal the melodist and all that but I I want I just want to keep it in our context the fing of the church it is filling to that abiding grace of God that's where the church is fing to that abiding Grace we want Grace without the word Grace without the word will take you to disgrace amen and abiding Grace will give you the full benefit sir that abiding Grace will change your life it will change your desire you see the filling of the church is filling On th abiding Grace tonight you will shout you will clap your hands you will dance in the eyes speaking the tongues that's Gift gifts is no good unless you are abiding in the shakana glory amen unless you are abiding in the Shak of Glory if ye abide in me and my word abide in you Jesus says ask whatever you will praise the Lord ask whatever you will if you abide in me and my word abide in you it's a relationship it's falling in love with Jesus amen it's falling in love with Jesus we don't need to make our own religion it would never please the father amen because it's his love for us that attracts him to us his love for us that brings him to us it's a love affair It's A Love Affair praise the Lord just just just just stay there a little bit with him just stay there with him hold to his word like I said from the beginning we see all the things that are against us and we don't see what is there for us we don't see the things we don't see the promises that are there for us we don't see you know the word that is there for we don't see the angels that are there for us we don't even see the god that is there for us the devil is against us the you know the the society is against us you know and the culture is against us we see all of these things but there's a God that is there for us if you abide in me and my word abide in you praise the Lord Solomon displayed that in the Book of Solomon Chapter 5 you know he talking about those lovers you know and and uh and and uh you know the the the the bridegroom is wanting the bride to stay there with him the bride is so attracted to all the things that the bridegroom has given her she attracted to all the things and she's not attracted to him she attracted to the gift she attracted to this she but she's not attracted he's trying to get her attention still I give you all of these things why should the gifts take your eyes from The Giver she attracted to all the things but she's not attracted to her lover that is the abiding Grace that we need that is the abiding Grace that we need that's the abiding Grace that we need brother Bram says stay in the presence of the Sun and all the greenness will be B out of you all the greenness will be back out of us all we need to do is just just St with the word just stay with the word you have to carry on some kind of a Pentecostal exercise to get closer to God you can't get closer to God it's God that come to get closer to you how can you get closer to God Amen all about the scripture brother one the scripture say draw near to God you can't draw near God have to draw near to you before you will come closer to him as he's Drawing Near he's drawing in you as he's drawing here he's drawing you so you see there is there is that there is that you see that's why the brother Brown would tell you if you have a problem in the church he says stay there why he say stay there because there is an abiding Grace there is an abiding Grace there is an abiding Grace it's God that give it it's not a it's not a man Lord that we can wrap our mind around it's God that give it as we stay there we keep trusting the Lord we keep holding to God I tell you I'm looking to almighty God for the future of this church as long as I'm living I'm not trying to appeal to you to to keep you around I mean if the Lord open doors for you and you get a job or you get another place to go you know I I I'll give you my 100% support because recently I was meditating and praying on this scripture I said Lord Jesus when you were here you say all that the father has given me will come that's that's an Earnest statement from my heart to you because all all all that we need to do is to just lift him high he said if I be lifted up I will draw man how do we lift him up by the standard of the word there's a word that is given to us there's a word we have to we have to uphold there's a repetition the name of Jesus we represent him at work we represent him in the street we represent him when we are alone when we lift his name up he says I will draw I get the drawing power in my hands are we together about in what you have heard from the beginning and that's what people don't want to do they are all confused praise the Lord all of these people after 40 years they said now that you discover that youve being deceived the thing that deceived you give you a wife it gave you a decent wife to marry the thing that deceive you gave you a family to raise praise the Lord because you use the order of the message you use the instruction of the Prophet to raise your home the thing that deceive you it gave you a decent home you see that is that is why Solomon was talking this lover she got attracted to all the things that her bridegroom gave her and she left him amenallah now I got a good family my children are doing well and and see I I I built a big house I built a big church and this this this you got attracted to all the things but read read that H son of Solomon when the night time comes she went into the street looking for her lovers yes sir there's a night time that is coming praise the Lord I tell some of these brothers I said you you wouldn't have married the kind of for you will have married divorce married divorce if you were if were not because of this message you want to tell us is that William brandham is wrong well you going to get a virous wife even now you cut in all The Virtue off of her cutting her hair wearing trousers and all of that just just just a moment of time just a moment of time you'll find yourself if you abide in me and my word abide in you remember Church the word is the only thing that has to keep in power Paul says in
