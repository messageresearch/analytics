[53:35] gathered in your name, there you are in
[53:37] their midst. And we have seen that time
[53:40] and again. It has never failed. And we

[54:17] Father, keep us on our toes. Do not let
[54:20] us relent in our walk with you. We pray
[54:24] for strength that Father, you will bring
[54:26] us onto an expected end that wherever we
[54:29] find ourselves, Father, oh God, we shall
[54:32] praise your holy name in good health and
[54:34] in sickness, in in plenty and in
[54:37] nothing. Whether we are in the mountain
[54:39] top or in the valley below, Father, do
[54:42] not let that make any difference. Let us
[54:44] always bring you praise because praise
[54:46] belongs to you and to you alone. Father,
[54:49] we are so grateful for being the Lord
[54:52] our God in whom we have put our trust.
[54:54] Thank you, Jesus. And praise be to thee
[54:57] tonight, Lord. Father, we have gathered
[55:00] not to hear the enticing words of men's
[55:01] wisdom, but that we may hear from you,

[55:33] um when we come here and then we see one
[55:37] another. It's just a joy.
[55:40] Um, we know how busy life is here in
[55:42] America.
[55:44] So, if in the middle in the midst of it
[55:46] all, we can make time to be in the house
[55:49] of God. Amen. God will never forget our
[55:53] labor of love for him. Praise the Lord.
[55:57] Whatever you do for the kingdom of God,
[56:00] know that there is a reward for it.
[56:02] Praise the Lord. Shall we turn to Psalm
[56:07] 144?
[56:11] Psalm
[56:19] 144 I read verse 1 and
[56:24] two. Blessed be the Lord my strength
[56:28] which teacheth my hands to war and my
[56:32] fingers to
[56:33] fight. my goodness and my fortress, my
[56:38] high tower and my deliverer, my shield,
[56:42] and he in whom I trust. Yes. Who
[56:46] subdueth
[56:48] my people under me. Praise the Lord. May
[56:52] the Lord add his blessings to the
[56:54] reading of his word. Shall we be seated?
[56:57] Praise the Lord. Tonight I have titled
[57:01] this.
[57:02] The Lord is my shield in whom I trust.
[57:07] Praise the Lord. Amen. The Lord is my
[57:10] shield in whom I trust.
[57:15] As I was seated in the pastor's office
[57:17] and just trying to put my toes together
[57:21] uh because my mind was just cuted all
[57:23] over, I feel things were coming and I I
[57:27] just decided to put them down um just to
[57:30] walk into the message tonight. Praise
[57:33] the Lord. It's just
[57:37] amazing how the Lord wants to have
[57:39] fellowship with his people.
[57:42] Just
[57:43] imagine that a friend you have not seen
[57:46] for a very long time, a friend who means
[57:50] everything to you, the friend
[57:53] comes and then pays you a visit and then
[57:57] you take this friend and you put them in
[58:00] the living
[58:02] room and then you go to bed. You come up
[58:05] in the morning, they are seated, you
[58:08] look into their face, you bypass them,
[58:11] you go. No hello, no communication
[58:14] whatsoever. Nothing. There is no
[58:16] relationship, no fellowship. You just
[58:19] go. You come, they are seated, you look
[58:22] at them in the face and you go in. It's
[58:26] just the way we sometimes treat the Lord
[58:29] our God.
[58:32] We treat him like he doesn't belong. We
[58:35] treat him like he doesn't deserve our
[58:37] time. We treat him like he doesn't
[58:39] deserve our respect. After everything he
[58:42] has suffered and done for
[58:44] us. But the Lord our God wants
[58:47] fellowship. It means everything to him
[58:52] more than we have ever
[58:54] imagined. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[58:59] Just somewhere last week, my wife was
[59:02] sharing a
[59:03] testimony, there is a particular time in
[59:06] the day that I just enjoy to be before
[59:10] the Lord. And if there is any time the
[59:13] devil would fight me is just around that
[59:16] time. It means so much to me, I can't
[59:20] explain why and how. But one thing I do
[59:24] know that that time means a lot to me.
[59:28] And on this day, I was just having my
[59:31] fellowship. The children were in bed and
[59:33] I just sat there and I was just enjoying
[59:34] the
[59:36] Lord. My wife was at work. We have a
[59:40] video in the living room and then she
[59:45] was there at work and then she had me on
[59:48] the video. I didn't know. And while I
[59:51] was just sitting down and enjoying the
[59:54] Lord, enjoying the fellowship, enjoying
[59:56] that
[59:57] time, she said there was somebody seated
[1:00:02] next to me. Now when you come to our
[1:00:04] living room, there is a desk behind
[1:00:06] there. That is where gospel
[1:00:09] studies and there was somebody in that
[1:00:13] seat and she was trying to find out who
[1:00:16] is this. So she just enlarged it to try
[1:00:20] to figure out but the children should be
[1:00:22] in bed around this time. What are they
[1:00:24] doing? And it was not Emmanuel. It was
[1:00:26] not God's will. But who is
[1:00:29] this? And then I didn't know there was
[1:00:33] anything going on. I just sat down there
[1:00:36] did what I was supposed to do and I went
[1:00:39] to bed. So now God asked the mommy. So
[1:00:44] when daddy finished with his
[1:00:47] devotion, did you see anybody leave the
[1:00:49] chair? Mommy, he said, "No, I just
[1:00:51] didn't see anybody." When she was done,
[1:00:53] he was
[1:00:54] done. And I just told him, I just told
[1:00:57] him that it was the angel of the Lord.
[1:01:00] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:01:03] Now when you give your time to
[1:01:07] God, when you dedicate yourself to
[1:01:11] God, when you come to the place to
[1:01:14] acknowledge that God means everything to
[1:01:18] you and you are ready to die for what
[1:01:20] you believe and what you stand for, I
[1:01:23] the Lord our God would never turn his
[1:01:25] back on you. We have seen that play out
[1:01:28] time and again.
[1:01:32] When you sit to have fellowship with
[1:01:34] God, God comes down.
[1:01:37] I remember co covid time either in 2019
[1:01:41] or 2020, we used to have fellowship in
[1:01:43] our house. Brother one will go to
[1:01:46] brother brother Jordan's place in St.
[1:01:49] Paul and then they broadcast
[1:01:51] everything. We would go and pick this
[1:01:53] villa at the time she was in Bloomington
[1:01:56] bring her to Plymouth. We will sit down
[1:01:58] and have fellowship together and when
[1:02:00] fellowship is over we will drive her
[1:02:03] back and come home. There was this day
[1:02:05] we brought her and normally before the
[1:02:08] service starts we will just pray. After
[1:02:10] service we will pray again. So we prayed
[1:02:14] and service started by the one finish
[1:02:16] ministering and then we prayed and when
[1:02:19] we were done s there she is. She asked
[1:02:22] me brother did you see anything? I said
[1:02:25] no. And then she was sitting down
[1:02:27] quietly. You didn't see anything. I said
[1:02:30] no. And she said when we were praying,
[1:02:34] light came through that door. It was
[1:02:37] those wide doors beside the main
[1:02:40] entrance and then there was light that
[1:02:44] came through. And not just light, but it
[1:02:47] was accompanied by heat. And she said it
[1:02:50] was so intense. It was burning her feet
[1:02:53] and burning her side that she turned her
[1:02:55] feet on the side and it was still
[1:02:58] burning and she just opened her eyes.
[1:03:01] She didn't see
[1:03:03] anything. And I said it was the Lord.
[1:03:07] When a man's way pleases the Lord, there
[1:03:10] is nothing the Lord would not do.
[1:03:13] Sometimes when we have fellowship, it
[1:03:15] doesn't matter why it is.
[1:03:19] God is not in numbers. Amen. God numbers
[1:03:23] don't mean anything to God. God wants a
[1:03:26] people with a sincere heart.
[1:03:28] A people that have dedicated themselves
[1:03:31] and are ready for this journey. Amen.
[1:03:36] Don't let fear
[1:03:38] hold you back.
[1:03:40] Praise the Lord. Amen. We are serving a
[1:03:42] living God. Who cares? Amen. I have
[1:03:45] shared this story a thousand times and
[1:03:48] if Christ tries I will share it another
[1:03:50] thousand times. Amen. About that little
[1:03:53] girl somewhere in Tema in some part of
[1:03:56] Ghana that will just walk on that bush
[1:03:59] path and go to church and then she'll
[1:04:02] cross from church at 9:00 p.m. she's on
[1:04:05] that small bush path singing and
[1:04:07] praising God and just going home. Praise
[1:04:10] the Lord. Amen. And I it was this day
[1:04:13] she was on that journey again praising
[1:04:16] the Lord not knowing somebody had taken
[1:04:18] notice of her and was trying to take
[1:04:20] advantage of her. She knew that time the
[1:04:24] lady was going to pass on that road and
[1:04:26] she came and they laid in the dark
[1:04:28] waiting for her to come. And as this
[1:04:30] lady was just coming and she was just
[1:04:33] singing and praising God, she didn't
[1:04:34] know there was any danger lurking
[1:04:36] around. And when she got so close, when
[1:04:41] the man lifted his eyes up as he later
[1:04:44] on confessed, what he saw was the lady
[1:04:47] was just singing and praising God. And
[1:04:50] there were armed men on the left and on
[1:04:53] the right. They were just guarding her
[1:04:55] as she was walking. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:04:58] the Lord. She did not know. She did not
[1:05:00] know. She did not see anything. But the
[1:05:03] Lord was with her.
[1:05:07] Hallelujah. The devil operates on our
[1:05:10] fear.
[1:05:13] And you know we have come to that place
[1:05:16] that we say we have believed and yet
[1:05:21] fear is so much operating in our lives
[1:05:26] that we hinder God in a lot of ways. The
[1:05:30] only thing that brings God on the scene
[1:05:32] is faith. Right? Fear does not bring
[1:05:36] God. So why fear is it's like you have
[1:05:40] tied God's hands.
[1:05:43] God is there. He wants to make a move.
[1:05:46] God is there. He wants to do something.
[1:05:48] He wants to come on the scene. But your
[1:05:52] fear is keeping him
[1:05:55] behind. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:05:59] Fear has ruined our lives in many many
[1:06:03] many many ways. In ways we don't even
[1:06:07] think possible.
[1:06:10] Fear. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:20] We are going. I
[1:06:24] mean if I had to go this
[1:06:27] direction just using my personal life
[1:06:30] probably in the next 1 hour or in the
[1:06:33] next one and a half hours I can go on
[1:06:35] talking about this. Praise the Lord
[1:06:38] because there is a lot the Lord has done
[1:06:41] for me. Amen. I'll be very very
[1:06:45] ungrateful to say the Lord has not done
[1:06:47] anything for me. The Lord has done more
[1:06:50] than enough for me. And if it comes to
[1:06:52] the divine protection of God, I can talk
[1:06:55] about this any day, any time for several
[1:06:58] hours. But praise be to God. What
[1:07:02] actually brought about this when brother
[1:07:04] one told me to get ready and encourage
[1:07:08] ourselves
[1:07:09] tonight was a video clip I saw. It's
[1:07:14] probably about I don't know maybe 2 or 3
[1:07:17] seconds
[1:07:18] long and
[1:07:20] then my mind just went
[1:07:24] around and it is based on
[1:07:28] that that I want us to encourage
[1:07:30] ourselves tonight.
[1:07:32] I have sent that video there. When I'm
[1:07:34] ready, sister Ned, I'll call for it. But
[1:07:38] just follow me. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:07:41] The Lord is my shield in whom I trust.
[1:07:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:50] Now, the
[1:07:53] earth was a hopeless case.
[1:07:58] A hopeless case. The Bible says that it
[1:08:02] was without form and void and darkness
[1:08:04] was upon the face of the deep.
[1:08:08] It was just a bundle of mess and chaos
[1:08:13] and
[1:08:15] confusion. There are no adjectives
[1:08:18] any man could ever put together to
[1:08:22] describe how useless this earth was once
[1:08:27] upon a time.
[1:08:30] God did not choose this earth because it
[1:08:34] was the easiest he could put
[1:08:37] together and then bring man on this
[1:08:39] earth. No, it was probably the worst of
[1:08:42] them
[1:08:45] all. It was just a
[1:08:48] mess. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:52] Now, God selected the earth. He chose
[1:08:59] it. And God with the intention he has to
[1:09:04] bring man on
[1:09:07] earth, he started his work of
[1:09:10] creation. We all know the story. The
[1:09:13] book of Genesis, let there be light and
[1:09:15] there was light. God created day and
[1:09:17] night and then on and on and on it
[1:09:22] won't for the earth to be able to
[1:09:25] sustain life. God had to give the earth
[1:09:35] life. The
[1:09:37] earth did not ask God to choose it.
[1:09:44] God chose the
[1:09:50] earth. He chose it.
[1:09:55] And he started his work of creation.
[1:10:00] put the waters together, formed an
[1:10:02] ocean, created the land, the trees, the
[1:10:05] vegetation, the moon to give and the
[1:10:07] stars to give light at night, the the
[1:10:09] sun to give light by day, the mountains
[1:10:12] we see, the rivers, I mean all the
[1:10:15] beautiful things we see on
[1:10:18] earth, God created them,
[1:10:21] placed them where they were
[1:10:24] placed for a cause.
[1:10:30] And when
[1:10:31] God finished with his
[1:10:35] creation, now
[1:10:40] note, God did all
[1:10:46] this and
[1:10:49] then he protected the earth. We don't
[1:10:53] see it. We don't see it. Praise the
[1:10:57] Lord. It's like having the angels of the
[1:11:00] Lord with
[1:11:03] you and you don't see them yet they are
[1:11:06] there.
[1:11:08] The earth is enjoying so great a
[1:11:12] protection but the earth doesn't know
[1:11:14] it.
[1:11:16] If you should ask the earth how is
[1:11:23] life? I promise you if the earth has
[1:11:26] mouth to speak, you will not hear of any
[1:11:29] good
[1:11:30] thing. Oh, there is so much noise these
[1:11:34] days, so much excavation going on, so
[1:11:38] much
[1:11:39] explosion, so much trouble, so much
[1:11:44] wars, so much
[1:11:46] bloodshed, so much earthquakes,
[1:11:49] so much
[1:11:51] tsunamis. You will not hear the word,
[1:11:54] you will not hear the earth talk about
[1:11:57] anything
[1:11:59] good because that is what it knows.
[1:12:04] Praise the Lord. Now, what brought me to
[1:12:07] this point as I said was a video
[1:12:12] clip that I saw. And before I go
[1:12:17] further, sister, can you please put that
[1:12:20] video here for us?
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:45] So you see that is the earth
[1:12:49] there. This is
[1:12:53] Jupiter. And then this is
[1:12:56] Jupiter. And you
[1:12:58] see those heavy heavy heavenly bodies
[1:13:02] that are coming to crash the
[1:13:04] earth. Some of them are so big, right?
[1:13:08] that they would crush the earth and the
[1:13:11] earth will just obliterate. That's
[1:13:13] right. It will just shatter it in one
[1:13:15] piece. But as they are coming to strike
[1:13:18] the earth, the Jupiter is there. And
[1:13:21] then I love the heading. Jupiter with
[1:13:23] its immense gravity captures many
[1:13:26] asteroids and commerce that could have
[1:13:30] originally collided with Earth, helping
[1:13:33] our planet avoid potential disasters. Is
[1:13:37] Jupiter really Earth's
[1:13:41] guardian? Praise the Lord. Amen. So, the
[1:13:46] Lord created the
[1:13:49] earth and he decided to protect the
[1:13:53] earth
[1:13:55] against every attack there
[1:13:58] is, every attack there would ever be.
[1:14:03] that everything that would come against
[1:14:05] the earth to destroy
[1:14:07] it, Jupiter is there to absorb it. When
[1:14:11] I saw it, it just hit me so much I
[1:14:13] decided to research it
[1:14:16] and it just blew my mind. Now think
[1:14:19] about it that if God spent all the time
[1:14:24] he spent to put this earth together in
[1:14:27] the condition it is and he did not leave
[1:14:31] it to chance. Right. Amen. But he
[1:14:34] decided to protect it against every
[1:14:37] invading force. Think about you. Yes.
[1:14:41] Amen. Think about you. That's right.
[1:14:44] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:14:47] He thought of it.
[1:14:51] You and I are also earth. Yeah.
[1:14:58] And you ask
[1:14:59] yourself between this earth and you whom
[1:15:03] are rest to God.
[1:15:05] God did not create us for the earth. He
[1:15:08] created the earth for us.
[1:15:11] And if the earth means so much to God
[1:15:15] that he can protect it against
[1:15:17] destruction, think about you.
[1:15:20] Praise the Lord. Amen. Fear should not
[1:15:23] be our portion.
[1:15:25] We are protected. Wherever you find
[1:15:29] yourself, don't let the devil tell you
[1:15:31] that you don't marry in the sight of
[1:15:33] God. You do.
[1:15:37] I have said it a thousand times. And I
[1:15:40] will say it again.
[1:15:43] If I step out there and I land there, it
[1:15:46] is the perfect will of God.
[1:15:49] I will not be intimidated by the fear of
[1:15:52] death.
[1:15:54] No. Once upon a time, I used to
[1:15:59] fear. Death is no longer in the
[1:16:02] equation. No. Amen. Don't serve God out
[1:16:06] of fear.
[1:16:09] The fear of going to hell. Don't let the
[1:16:12] fear of going to hell drive you into the
[1:16:15] arms of God. No. Let it be a love
[1:16:19] relationship.
[1:16:20] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. That's
[1:16:23] right. Don't begin to imagine how am I
[1:16:25] going to make it? How am I going to do
[1:16:28] it? God has already figured it out.
[1:16:30] Amen. Just walk by faith and believe in
[1:16:33] what God has done. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:36] Amen. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. The Lord
[1:16:40] is my she in whom I trust. Amen. Praise
[1:16:45] the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:16:49] Now
[1:16:51] remember that God created the earth for
[1:16:53] a purpose.
[1:16:57] And the earth has always served its
[1:17:02] godgiven purpose. That's right. Amen.
[1:17:06] Thank you, Jesus. It has never refused
[1:17:08] to shine its light. It has never refused
[1:17:12] to ch to to surrender to the change of
[1:17:15] seasons. It has never refused to bring
[1:17:18] the rains down the clock. It has it is
[1:17:21] doing what God has put it there to do.
[1:17:25] And so long as it is doing it God-given
[1:17:28] purpose, it has the divine protection of
[1:17:31] God. Amen. That's right. And remember
[1:17:34] also that we are not just here to be
[1:17:37] counted among just as numbers. Right. We
[1:17:41] are here with a Godgiven purpose. We are
[1:17:45] here to serve the purpose of God. And so
[1:17:48] long as you are serving the purpose of
[1:17:50] God, you have the divine protection of
[1:17:52] God.
[1:17:54] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. The only
[1:17:57] time I can think of that the
[1:18:03] earth the sun went to
[1:18:06] bed rather it was shining when it was
[1:18:09] supposed to be going to bed. It was
[1:18:10] awake. Was when Joshua Yeah. needed the
[1:18:14] son to do an extra work and he commanded
[1:18:17] the son to stay still. Amen. And the
[1:18:20] next time was when the Lord Jesus was
[1:18:23] crucified and he lay on the cross dying
[1:18:29] that the sun refused to give his life.
[1:18:33] The sun held his breath. The wind
[1:18:37] stopped to blow.
[1:18:41] This the earth could not hold his peace.
[1:18:45] The rocks rented.
[1:18:48] Praise the Lord. Oh man, what are you
[1:18:50] doing? This is the God of creation.
[1:18:53] That the earth could identify him.
[1:18:57] And men failed to identify that.
[1:19:01] But the earth has always performed its
[1:19:04] god-given duty. Yes. And when you are
[1:19:07] walking in the perfect will of God, when
[1:19:09] you are doing what God has mandated you
[1:19:11] to do as a son or as a daughter, leave
[1:19:15] the rest. You don't have to go to bed
[1:19:18] wondering which side of the bed you are
[1:19:20] going to rise up the following morning.
[1:19:22] Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. Be
[1:19:25] rest assured.
[1:19:27] Oh my goodness. I pray God to help us.
[1:19:31] Yes, Lord. We are serving a living God
[1:19:34] who cares. Amen. The Lord has delighted
[1:19:37] in us and because he has delighted in
[1:19:40] us, we have overcome.
[1:19:44] Thank you, Jesus. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:00] Now, a lot of the times
[1:20:05] We as children of God will come to a
[1:20:07] place and then things happen in our
[1:20:10] lives and then we begin to question if I
[1:20:13] love
[1:20:14] God, if I am doing my best for the
[1:20:17] service of God, if I have given my all,
[1:20:20] I have been faithful to the call. Why am
[1:20:24] I having challenges?
[1:20:26] Why am I having
[1:20:30] problems now?
[1:20:34] Some of
[1:20:36] it has to
[1:20:40] do with you not becoming too comfortable
[1:20:45] in this
[1:20:46] world. Praise the Lord. Right. This is
[1:20:50] not our home. Yes. That's right. We are
[1:20:53] just passing through. That's right.
[1:20:55] Amen.
[1:20:57] We need that awakening. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:01] that we are on a journey,
[1:21:04] that we are just passing through. Amen.
[1:21:06] Praise the Lord. And a lot of the times
[1:21:10] we complain and complain and complain
[1:21:12] and
[1:21:16] complain and we fail to see what God is
[1:21:21] doing behind the scenes.
[1:21:24] Praise the Lord. Thank you.
[1:21:29] Amen. Sometimes you get so
[1:21:32] broken, so so so broken, so torn apart.
[1:21:38] But you are not the first and you will
[1:21:40] not be the last. That's right.
[1:21:43] Your
[1:21:44] brokenness is meant to bring the best
[1:21:47] out of you. That's right. It's not meant
[1:21:49] to kill you. It's a brokenness that
[1:21:53] leads you to God. Yeah.
[1:21:56] If God should allow the devil to have
[1:21:58] his way in your life, you will not be
[1:22:01] seated here tonight.
[1:22:03] He has shielded you against all the
[1:22:07] terrible attacks. But then he allows
[1:22:10] some small small things in your life and
[1:22:14] even those small small things he uses
[1:22:16] that to reveal himself to you.
[1:22:20] And yet we don't want it.
[1:22:22] We want it to be just smooth, to be so
[1:22:25] comfortable, no challenges.
[1:22:28] No, it doesn't work out that way. Praise
[1:22:30] the Lord. When
[1:22:34] God when God breaks you, it is
[1:22:38] beautiful not to the eye, but to the
[1:22:42] soul. Yes, it doesn't put smiles on your
[1:22:45] face, but with all the brokenness, the
[1:22:50] tears, the
[1:22:51] pain, you look beautiful to him. Praise
[1:22:54] the Lord. Not to men, but to him. Amen.
[1:22:58] We saw that in the life of Job that he
[1:23:02] was so broken, so so broken that his
[1:23:06] friends came and sat and they couldn't
[1:23:08] even make him up. His wife couldn't take
[1:23:10] it anymore. And he said, "Why don't you
[1:23:12] curse this your God and die?"
[1:23:15] But in the sight of God, it was
[1:23:18] beautiful. We saw that in the Lord Jesus
[1:23:20] Christ that he was crushed to death. The
[1:23:24] most horrible death anyone could ever
[1:23:26] die. But it was beautiful in the sight
[1:23:29] of God. The Lord
[1:23:32] Jesus was broken for you and I. It
[1:23:36] pleased the father that his life was
[1:23:39] crushed.
[1:23:41] Praise the Lord. Now, a lot of the times
[1:23:45] we think he died a common
[1:23:49] death. Remember on the cross there were
[1:23:52] three two thieves and the Lord Jesus
[1:23:56] Christ. And we think, "Oh, they all were
[1:23:59] crucified. They all died." And we think
[1:24:02] his death was an ordinary death. It was
[1:24:05] not an ordinary death. One day I was
[1:24:08] just walking down the platform and it
[1:24:11] just hit me from nowhere that the Lord
[1:24:14] Jesus did not die an ordinary death.
[1:24:18] Yeah. The
[1:24:20] thief was just a
[1:24:24] soul dying. One one person just dying
[1:24:28] for
[1:24:29] himself. One just dying for himself. But
[1:24:33] think of it that the Lord Jesus
[1:24:38] died for every one of us. Yes.
[1:24:42] Every one of us.
[1:24:46] As many as have already lived, as many
[1:24:50] of us that are living today and as many
[1:24:53] as will live till the coming of the
[1:24:55] Lord. He died for every one of us. So
[1:24:59] think about it. Yes. How many billions
[1:25:02] are we today? Probably 8 billion. How
[1:25:05] many are already dead? I don't know. How
[1:25:07] many are going to be here towards the
[1:25:10] coming of the Lord Jesus? I don't know.
[1:25:13] So you can say that he
[1:25:16] died 10 billion times in that one death
[1:25:23] because he died for you. He died for me.
[1:25:26] He died for you. He died for everyone.
[1:25:29] Yes, that's right. So, it was not an
[1:25:32] ordinary
[1:25:35] death. I never thought of it that
[1:25:39] way. But when it hit me, I said,
[1:25:43] "Wow, praise the Lord." Praise the Lord.
[1:25:47] Now, listen. in the
[1:25:50] message the bomb of
[1:25:53] Gilead 1959
[1:25:56] 11:24 he was put to the
[1:25:59] test there he went to
[1:26:02] Calvary mockery spit all over his face
[1:26:06] his face bleeding where they jacked
[1:26:10] handfuls of beard out of his face
[1:26:15] beaten when he could have spoke one word
[1:26:19] and it would have changed the whole
[1:26:21] thing. Excuse me. But the thousand held
[1:26:25] he died. He had the sins of the world.
[1:26:29] Every sin that was ever in the world was
[1:26:33] placed upon him. Yeah. Under the burden
[1:26:36] of sin, with all the weight of sin laid
[1:26:41] upon him, he died. He died until the sun
[1:26:45] went down in the middle of the day. He
[1:26:48] died until the stars wouldn't shine. He
[1:26:51] died till the moon wouldn't shine. He
[1:26:54] died until the earth had a nervous
[1:26:57] frustration.
[1:26:59] Shook so hard, right? With a chill under
[1:27:02] the rocks, ran out of the mountains. He
[1:27:06] died a death that nothing could die.
[1:27:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:11] The death he died, nothing could die
[1:27:13] that death. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:27:17] Excuse
[1:27:21] me. He died such a sinful
[1:27:25] death. So
[1:27:27] gruesome, but it was beautiful to the
[1:27:30] father. This was just a footnote I
[1:27:32] added. A servant is not greater than his
[1:27:35] master.
[1:27:37] And if he went through what he went
[1:27:39] through,
[1:27:41] do you want us
[1:27:45] to just come
[1:27:47] and just have things so so so easy.
[1:27:51] Somewhere in the Bible, the Bible says,
[1:27:54] "Let any man that comes after me deny
[1:27:57] himself, take up his cross, and follow
[1:28:01] me." That's right. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:04] There is a cross for you. There is a
[1:28:06] cross for me. I don't get to choose my
[1:28:08] cross. And you don't get to choose your
[1:28:11] cross. Yeah.
[1:28:13] If I have to choose my cross, I'll go
[1:28:14] for the very light one. That's right.
[1:28:16] And I don't get to choose your cross for
[1:28:18] you. Neither do you. Because if I have
[1:28:20] to choose your cross for you, I will
[1:28:23] probably go and look at the heavy one
[1:28:25] and give it to
[1:28:27] you. Make sure you sweat and sweat very
[1:28:29] well. But I don't have the luxury. I
[1:28:32] mean, so we all have a cross to carry.
[1:28:34] That's right.
[1:28:36] If he being the lord of lords and the
[1:28:39] king of kings, the almighty god came
[1:28:43] into human came in human flesh and he
[1:28:46] went through what he went through. Do
[1:28:48] you expect me and you to just come and
[1:28:52] have it so so so easy, so soft? No, it
[1:28:57] doesn't work that way. If you have it
[1:28:59] that way, there is something wrong.
[1:29:01] Right?
[1:29:07] Praise the Lord. Amen. If you have it
[1:29:10] that way, that means there is something
[1:29:13] wrong. Sometimes you are so
[1:29:17] broken. So broken beyond
[1:29:20] repair and you would question your
[1:29:23] faith. You will question the love of God
[1:29:26] for you.
[1:29:28] But it doesn't change anything. Yeah.
[1:29:32] like a sister one time
[1:29:36] confessed how all hell was against
[1:29:41] her. And almost all night she will be
[1:29:45] crying, praying, crying. Nothing was
[1:29:48] changing. But then she would come out
[1:29:50] with all the smiles in the world on her
[1:29:53] face, giving people cheer, giving people
[1:29:56] hope. Nobody knew what she was going
[1:29:58] through
[1:30:00] behind the scenes.
[1:30:03] People are fighting battles you probably
[1:30:06] have never imagined.
[1:30:11] Amen. And if they are making it and if
[1:30:14] they have come this far by grace, it
[1:30:16] means you can do it.
[1:30:19] It is by grace. Amen. We are all
[1:30:21] depending on the grace of God to see us
[1:30:24] through. Amen. And by grace he has
[1:30:26] brought us this far.
[1:30:29] God
[1:30:30] knew that in the day and age we are
[1:30:33] living
[1:30:34] in
[1:30:36] 200
[1:30:38] billion demons will be released into the
[1:30:40] earth. Right. And he
[1:30:43] has positioned us. Yes. Amen. He has
[1:30:48] given us that that protection. Yes. We
[1:30:51] have no cause to fail. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:54] Right.
[1:30:55] God has given us everything we have need
[1:30:59] of. We have no reason to fail.
[1:31:05] We are shielded against every one of
[1:31:08] these demons.
[1:31:10] Amen. By the grace of God. Amen.
[1:31:14] We shall serve the purpose of God.
[1:31:17] It doesn't matter what comes our way. We
[1:31:20] shall do the will of God. That's right.
[1:31:22] He will bring us onto an expected end
[1:31:25] for his name's sake. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:31:28] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:30] Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:31:35] It's good to be
[1:31:37] broken. It's good to be
[1:31:41] broken. And when God is breaking
[1:31:46] you, we complain too much.
[1:31:51] Ask for
[1:31:53] grace to be able to endure
[1:31:56] that you may see the glory of
[1:32:01] God. There was a little
[1:32:05] girl that was going to write her final
[1:32:09] exams. Now I tell my boys, I say you
[1:32:14] have no reason to fail any course here
[1:32:18] in America. Wow. Because the system is
[1:32:22] designed to make sure you don't fail.
[1:32:27] Those homework you do, they count.
[1:32:33] Showing up in class, they have something
[1:32:35] they call court. I asked them what is
[1:32:37] called it say it's a place you go in the
[1:32:39] morning to receive direction and also
[1:32:42] the market.
[1:32:46] The system is designed to make sure you
[1:32:48] don't
[1:32:49] fail. But elsewhere in the world, they
[1:32:53] will teach you all the things.
[1:32:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:01] All the assignments you do don't count.
[1:33:04] Yeah. You showing up doesn't count. All
[1:33:09] the test and the quiz, they don't count.
[1:33:12] Now there comes a
[1:33:14] time that there is an exam hall where
[1:33:18] you go and you have to go in to find out
[1:33:21] where am I sitting. You go oh this is my
[1:33:24] seat ahead of time and then even your
[1:33:28] exams are not marked in the school.
[1:33:31] Sometimes they are not even marked in
[1:33:32] the country right West Africa exams
[1:33:34] council they send it outside and then
[1:33:38] they mark it outside somebody who
[1:33:40] doesn't even know how you look. They've
[1:33:42] never seen your
[1:33:44] face. They are going to mark your paper.
[1:33:48] Yeah. And can you imagine a situation
[1:33:51] like that?
[1:33:53] So I tell them, you have no reason to
[1:33:54] fail in this country.
[1:33:58] And then this lady was going to write
[1:34:00] her exam. Praise the Lord.
[1:34:04] And it
[1:34:06] was an artist.
[1:34:10] they were doing drawing just um image.
[1:34:14] She was so brilliant in what she was
[1:34:15] doing and then there was an opposition
[1:34:20] in the class. There were people in the
[1:34:22] class that didn't like her. So when they
[1:34:26] went in and they went and then they saw
[1:34:28] their seats and everything, everything
[1:34:31] were placed,
[1:34:32] their their crayons, um books, I mean no
[1:34:37] no not no books and everything, rulers
[1:34:41] and everything that they need for the
[1:34:42] assignment. They placed everything and
[1:34:45] for some reason a group of these
[1:34:49] students sneaked in by night and they
[1:34:53] went to her desk and they crushed all
[1:34:57] her
[1:34:58] crayons, crushed everything, broke
[1:35:01] everything and put it right back in the
[1:35:04] case. So the following day they came and
[1:35:08] before the exam you can ask all the
[1:35:11] questions in the
[1:35:14] world. But during that
[1:35:17] exam when you go in there is a police
[1:35:20] standing
[1:35:22] there. There is a police
[1:35:25] present to make sure that there is
[1:35:27] order. You have no right to ask any
[1:35:29] question. Everything you were taught
[1:35:32] over the years, now you have time to
[1:35:34] prove. Two hours, three hours to prove
[1:35:37] it. And then she went in and sat
[1:35:40] down, took her crayons. Oh my goodness.
[1:35:42] Everything was shattered in
[1:35:45] pieces. I could
[1:35:47] imagine people that were sitting and
[1:35:49] looking at her, glassing on the desk and
[1:35:51] laughing. Oh, we got it. We got it.
[1:35:54] And then she just sat down and prayed.
[1:35:59] She was a Christian girl.
[1:36:02] And then she sat down. Can you imagine
[1:36:06] writing an exam under that condition?
[1:36:09] Her heart was so broken that she started
[1:36:13] crying. She was crying. But she took
[1:36:17] every piece of the
[1:36:20] crayon. She would just color. When that
[1:36:24] is finishing, she'll put it aside and
[1:36:26] then go for the next bigger piece. and
[1:36:30] then continue. When that is finishing,
[1:36:33] she'll put that aside, go for the next
[1:36:35] piece, and then she'll get to a place.
[1:36:38] Oh, I was thinking of putting red here.
[1:36:42] Um, all the red is turned into dust, but
[1:36:45] um I only have green here. So, okay,
[1:36:49] this is against my plan, but this is
[1:36:52] what I have. And then she would use it.
[1:36:55] She would use it. And then in the midst
[1:36:57] of it, she was just crying with tears
[1:37:00] dropping on her work. And then she would
[1:37:02] try to erase it and it will smear the
[1:37:05] work.
[1:37:08] It would just smear it. When she got
[1:37:11] through, she looked at what was before
[1:37:13] her. She prayed and submitted. And guess
[1:37:18] what? Her work was the best they ever
[1:37:21] saw. Praise the Lord. Amen. And when
[1:37:25] they asked her, "How did you do it?" She
[1:37:27] said, "I don't know."
[1:37:30] Everything just blended like a rainbow
[1:37:34] and they said, "No, they have never seen
[1:37:36] this before. The enemy meant it for
[1:37:39] evil, but God turned the tides around."
[1:37:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:46] So, in our walk with God, there are a
[1:37:48] lot of things the devil is going to
[1:37:50] bring against us made for evil. But I
[1:37:53] promise you by the name of the Lord
[1:37:54] Jesus, God is going to turn the tides
[1:37:57] around. And instead of you being down,
[1:38:00] you are going to be on top.
[1:38:03] The Lord our God has shielded us against
[1:38:05] every dirty trick of the enemy. We are
[1:38:08] in the hands of God and nothing can go
[1:38:10] wrong. Praise the Lord. How did you do
[1:38:14] it? I don't know.
[1:38:17] And I know we will get there. Amen. When
[1:38:20] they ask you how did you make it,
[1:38:22] brother? I don't know. Yeah. I know a
[1:38:27] man whose
[1:38:29] name is Jesus. Amen.
[1:38:32] Praise the Lord. Is by his grace.
[1:38:37] You ask that thief
[1:38:40] whom the Lord Jesus told you be with me
[1:38:42] in paradise today. Yeah. You ask you,
[1:38:44] how did you make it? I don't know.
[1:38:47] I don't know.
[1:38:51] The grace of God upon your life would
[1:38:53] never be in vain. Amen. And your faith
[1:38:57] in God would never be in vain.
[1:39:00] Keep holding on. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:08] We have not
[1:39:10] believed any kindly devised fable
[1:39:14] in the message demonology.
[1:39:18] religious
[1:39:19] realm. The prophet speaks, "I saw a
[1:39:23] vision. I saw a world like this round
[1:39:27] another world." Excuse me. But this one
[1:39:31] here, it had a rainbow around it. And
[1:39:35] that was the blood of Christ that
[1:39:38] protects God's wrath. Yes. Can you
[1:39:43] imagine that? God knows we are human.
[1:39:47] That he knows our frame. He knows what
[1:39:50] we are capable of. He knows how
[1:39:53] dangerous we can be.
[1:39:57] The Bible says the heart of man is
[1:39:59] desperately wicked. God knows what we
[1:40:03] are capable of doing. And to make sure
[1:40:06] that he has constant fellowship with us
[1:40:09] and that he doesn't destroy us, he made
[1:40:12] a provision.
[1:40:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:15] That the
[1:40:18] Lord shed his blood for you and me. And
[1:40:22] the prophet of God said is I think I'm
[1:40:25] going ahead of myself here now. The
[1:40:28] blood the the blood of Christ that
[1:40:30] protects God's
[1:40:31] wrath. He couldn't look upon that.
[1:40:36] He had destroyed the thing right now
[1:40:39] because he said the day you eat there
[1:40:42] that day you die. So he had do it then I
[1:40:46] thought like this I sin myself although
[1:40:51] I didn't do that but I was a sinner
[1:40:54] anyhow. Yes. And then the blood of Jesus
[1:40:58] Christ asks to us like a bumper. See?
[1:41:02] Yeah. That when I s my sins hit him.
[1:41:07] That's right. And it j his precious head
[1:41:12] and I could see the tears. Yeah. And
[1:41:15] blood running down. Forgive him, father.
[1:41:20] He don't know what he's doing. Yeah. And
[1:41:23] I'll do something else and hit
[1:41:27] it. Forgive him,
[1:41:29] father. If it had ever passed him, I've
[1:41:34] been destroyed. Yeah. And if I'd never
[1:41:37] accepted his grace and the day my soul
[1:41:41] sailed beyond
[1:41:43] that, I'm already judged. I've
[1:41:47] rejected. There is nothing left but
[1:41:51] judgment. I've already been judged. God
[1:41:54] said the day you eat thereof, that day
[1:41:57] you die, you are judged, right? This is
[1:42:00] the judgment seat this afternoon. Your
[1:42:03] attitude towards Christ. Praise the
[1:42:05] Lord. Amen. So the
[1:42:08] blood acts as a
[1:42:11] bumper for you and me. If it wasn't for
[1:42:14] the sake of the
[1:42:16] blood, you and I would not be seated
[1:42:18] here tonight. But it acts as a bumper.
[1:42:21] Amen. That when we
[1:42:24] sin, the wrath of God cannot even come
[1:42:28] against us. because of the blood. Praise
[1:42:32] the Lord. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. For
[1:42:34] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:42:37] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:42:39] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:42:41] have everlasting life.
[1:42:44] God sent his only begotten son. He
[1:42:47] didn't hold him back. He gave him as a
[1:42:49] ransom for our sins.
[1:42:53] He shed his blood for you and me. Praise
[1:42:57] the Lord. Amen. When I see the blood, I
[1:43:00] will pass over you.
[1:43:03] It is not deliver but the life in the
[1:43:06] blood. When you are living the life,
[1:43:09] praise the Lord. Any danger that comes
[1:43:11] against you would leave you alone.
[1:43:14] Praise the Lord. Because when they come,
[1:43:15] they don't see you. They see Christ.
[1:43:18] Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Praise the
[1:43:21] Lord. Amen.
[1:43:24] If all we have, if all we have of his
[1:43:29] resurrection is an empty tomb of all
[1:43:40] people, what do
[1:43:43] you if if all we have of his
[1:43:46] resurrection is an empty
[1:43:48] tomb, let me just use the word We have
[1:43:51] short changed ourselves.
[1:43:57] He didn't
[1:43:59] come to live the life he lived and to
[1:44:02] die for you and me just to leave an
[1:44:05] empty tomb. No.
[1:44:09] He told his disciples after a while I
[1:44:12] will come back. The world would not see
[1:44:14] me but you would see me. You will know
[1:44:17] when I come. Thank you Lord. Amen. He
[1:44:20] wants to be in you
[1:44:22] to use your hands and your feet. Amen.
[1:44:25] To use your tongue, your mouth, and your
[1:44:27] lips. To use your eyes to live in you,
[1:44:31] to walk in you. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:44:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:40] If we say he's
[1:44:43] alive, we should not be pointing to the
[1:44:46] empty tomb. You should be pointing to
[1:44:48] your life. That's right.
[1:44:51] Amen. That's right. We are the evidence
[1:44:55] that he is.
[1:44:57] Anything less than that, we have let him
[1:45:00] down. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:45:03] Brother one, you mind coming over? God
[1:45:06] bless you all tonight.
[1:45:08] Amen.
[1:45:21] Thank you for today.
[1:45:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:45:33] That was beautiful tonight. Amen. That
[1:45:36] was beautiful tonight.
[1:45:38] That was beautiful tonight. I was
[1:45:40] thinking while he was talking there, you
[1:45:43] know, there was an empty tomb so our
[1:45:45] hearts can be filled. Amen. If the tomb
[1:45:49] was not empty, our hearts will be
[1:45:52] empty. He emptied the tomb so he can
[1:45:55] fill our hearts. Praise the Lord.
[1:46:00] Amen. Let's just bow our heads together
[1:46:02] tonight.
[1:46:09] Just play a little bit of that
[1:46:12] tonight. I'm the porter. That wasn't

[1:48:14] Lord, wash
[1:48:16] me. I
[1:48:18] [Laughter]
[1:48:19] [Music]
[1:48:21] pray as in thy
[1:48:25] bread. In thy
[1:48:28] presence
[1:48:31] humbly I bow. Father, tonight that's
[1:48:35] what we are saying. Oh God, we just we
[1:48:37] want to thank you Lord for your
[1:48:39] word. Oh
[1:48:41] God, what what a word of assurance.
[1:48:46] Lord, you are our shade. You are our
[1:48:49] protector. You have created Lord a air
[1:48:52] around us. Oh God, you have given us
[1:48:56] Lord a blood bumper. Oh father
[1:48:59] God, you have given your angels charge
[1:49:02] over us.
[1:49:05] promises upon promises. Lord, I will
[1:49:08] never leave you. I will never forsake
[1:49:11] [Music]
[1:49:13] you just to be able to reassure us. Oh,
[1:49:17] Father
[1:49:18] God, that no matter what we are going
[1:49:21] through, no matter what we are dealing
[1:49:23] with, if we can just, Father, Lord, just
[1:49:27] turn the picture
[1:49:29] around. Now, how we are looking at it,
[1:49:32] but how are you looking at it? How are
[1:49:34] you looking at the
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:43] situation like our brother said, father
[1:49:46] David said in the
[1:49:49] psalm, precious precious in the sight of
[1:49:52] the
[1:49:53] Lord is the death of the saints.
[1:49:57] Isaiah
[1:50:01] said how it brought you pleasure. Isaiah
[1:50:05] 53, it pleased the Lord that he will be
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:13] bruised. It's beautiful in your side. If
[1:50:16] we can just see the picture the way you
[1:50:18] are looking at
[1:50:20] it from our side,
