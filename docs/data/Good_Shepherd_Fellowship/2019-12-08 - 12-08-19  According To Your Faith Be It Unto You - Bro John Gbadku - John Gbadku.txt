and we want to thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity to come and bring our praises to him praise the Lord and like brother scattered knowledge the ones that were baptized yesterday there was a privilege and our opportunity to take these dear ones down to the water praise the Lord amen can we just appreciate the law for there [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] young Imam where was the one that request the baptism couple of months now and we've been trying to work out how to do it and then some time ago young Elijah said he has some questions for me and he says I want to tell you something but I have some questions for you praise the Lord in and so we got in the office and y-axes questions and and then after that he says I want to be baptized I said well okay praise the Lord then we had a privilege to talk with our young sister Priscilla last Sunday and what there is a pastor or in Angie real caliber had a privilege to talk to him yesterday and the young sister loved the Lord and but she just been having I mean she been terrified by the enemy you know with some very awful dreams and then so she didn't talk to me about it and why we were talking and you know and then actually if she was ever baptized she said no I said well you know we we accept the law by faith I call into Romans chapter 10 you know like Paul says if we believe with our heart and confess with our mouth you know we are safe but yet there you know our faith save us in a lord but baptism identify us with the body there was crucified for us that took our sin and I resurrected for our justification so we call a scepter law by faith but if we are never baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus we are robbing ourselves of the benefit of the body of the Lord Jesus so I challenge her faith and she accepted to be baptized and it'll talk to her Darren and I did yesterday morning so we baptize her in the name of the Lord Jesus and young brother Joseph wanted to rededicate himself in baptism he was baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus from Christian Assembly they're over in ibadan and Julia but he just felt he needed to get closer to the Lord Amen praise the Lord so he rededicated himself in baptism yesterday and praise the Lord Amen so we want to thank the law for their praise the Lord so grateful that the Lord will be able to touch these young hats we pray that a law we kind of restraint in them thank you for all the brothers that came around to help yesterday brother Moses and all of the brothers we were thinking on what to do you know to be able to set up the Baptist raid and all of that so we're scare that was why we changed the time from 10:00 to 12:00 because we kind of a pick it up Layton and setting it up and then you know brother in Zika came to also help us to just bring some little temperature to the water praise the Lord amen so we thank the Lord for their amen I told the young people yesterday I says the ones that are there don't decide where to be buried with their life we buried them where we want to bury them so so you don't have no decision whether the water is Cornell you are dead just except to be buried but then I had to identify myself also with the water so praise the Lord this morning we have brother John but Dooku from Togo naturally he's originally from Ghana went to Togo many years back in the 80s started a church there but John being a kind of a distant friend from me you know we have been knowing him many years and we met on Convention but then I started hearing of the work in bok'nor faso the work in malay and a little group that started sometime in audial you know in all of those area and I've been interested in missions since you know I started saving a lot of preaching and I always want to know you know who started I work there who is the brother there you know and a lot of the history was pointed back to his church because most of the brothers that started there originated from him so we were able to get in contact and then I heard he was over in the States I tried when I was down in North Carolina for the meetings all the ministers came calling their names and then he came and introduced himself then I could put a name to the face I said but I know this brother you know but then I had to leave I never ended the meeting and had to come back home and then we started talking the brother called me 2 a.m. in the morning from back home and so I just thought it was an audience I took the phone card and we were talking he says brother John is in the States I want you to meet him I said brother is that why you woke me up this morning when we caught brother John and we talked a little bit so I told a brother on I'd like you to come over men out there some few things you

after I go don't praying this morning and just kind of a woke up with a pain in my back you know so thank God I don't have to preach this morning and but a John would just come as the Lord laid on his heart to encourage us to speak to us you will come and bring the word of the Lord to us this morning amen praise the Lord amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord let you stand on our feet

the Amalekites Moses need to be supported so you need to raise this hand up and the wall the one amen I bring greetings from my wife a little Church in Togo I spoke with them when I was here and they asked me to extend my greetings to you afraid that you would permit your pastor to visitors interval is better to go on several occasions has not been to my church but I believe this time God wants him to be in my case were fighting in one of our conventions and you know permit him to come with the use for him right well as I said we travel a lot in African countries most of the other than

home I've been to Burkina Faso I've been to Morocco to Guinea Bissau just to talk of you but we go on me wants to use me anyways as wife ammeter that I come to the state this year heaven yes let us turn to our feet respect to the Word of God want to read a familiar scripture before we approach the Word of God leaders Barra has for what affair pressures Heavenly Father we come before your throne of messy thank you you CLE from the depth of our heart for such a wonderful time that you have granted us to be together now we know there's nothing like incident before you for all things are pre-planned new jersey before the foundation of the world and you pre planned it you've made it manifest Lord you know the number of people that will be gathered together here you know whether we seated and the very dreaded he will be put in on rod we invite you to come among us in a special way as we are approaching the Word of God which without it the meeting cannot be complete you are the author of the wait come and speak to us come and help me Lord to be able to say that which needed to be said and to say it in the right way and to say the way that somebody will be blessed somebody will be healed somebody will fortify spiritually in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray against every satanic demonic power a very gentle spirit we bind them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and we ask that Lord your presence will have the preeminence among us you bless the preaching of the word you bless the hearing of the word Lord I commit your servant your care I ask value blessing wonderful abilities family there's the officers of the church and bless anti-tech father we thank you in Jesus name we pray as a sense giving thank you for having done it came in left hand to match.you the ninth chapter Matthew chapter 9 I want to read on the 27th West I read in English and when Jesus departed thence to a blind men followed him crying and saying the our son of David have mercy on us and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and Jesus said unto them believe me that I am able to do this they said unto Him yea Lord then touch ye the eyes same-same according to your faith with each and the eyes were opened and Jesus straitly charged them saying see that no man knows it but they they they went they were departed spread abroad is same in all the country metal ore that is rendering of the weight the megacity yeah we turned a lot for the scripture reg there's a well-known scripture I want to ponder over it for a few minutes and see what God has for us this morning the scripture speaks about two blind men that jesus healed a straight-ahead and when Jesus departed ends two blind men followed him crying ashamed out son of David have mercy on us and when he was coming to the house the blind men came to him and he says accident believe ye that I'm able to do this amen he says question them uttering them whether they believe that he's able to do what they were asking from him or whether they believe that he was able to heal them amen now before a man can be a blessing to you you need to believe him if we don't believe our pastor he cannot be a pleasant one if we don't believe our husbands they cannot be of blessing to us if we don't believe our wives they cannot be a blessing to us if our children doesn't believe us we cannot be a blessing to them likewise if we don't believe them they can also not be a blessing to us we found out here that it is very important that before somebody can be a blessing to you in a way you need to believe him so Jesus questioned them even though they came around crying shouting that he should have mercy on em he questioned them I can say it was a condition he put to them yeah you can only heal them or you can only do what they wanted him to do for them on the condition that they believe him amen there we finally hear that he tested them a demur spiritual test he tested the effect when he found out that they believed at him the scriptures say he touched their eyes and after touching their eyes he said unto them according to your faith be it unto you amen being small as a condition that he threw to them what you were looking for what you came for what you you are crying for I've caught your eyes but you need to have faith it would have done for you to be healed so he said according to your faith be it unto you I would like to use that sentence this morning as my topic or my team according to your faith be it unto you Amen now we we as believers we as method believers we as the bride of Jesus Christ we are said to be believers because we came by faith and we believe our Lord Jesus Christ and we separated ourselves from the world and it is of the world there are times situations demands faith situation call for faith sometimes we use faith without knowing and sometimes we need faith to use and we don't use it now what is faith what is faith we cannot use faith if we don't understand what faith is and thus creature explain what faith is to us in Hebrews the eleventh chapter faith in the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and the scripture said by it the elders obtained a good report the prophet of our age made us to know the faith is a revelation and then he went on to say effect is the sauce is the sixth sense he made us to know that we are born with it any time among or went we were given bath on his head we had the sixth sense but then we activity when we become believers and every believer is called to live by the sixth sense not the fashion sees because the five senses can deceive us here so we need to live by the sections the brother says the sixth sense is a super sense and the devil's honkin or widget earlier and when we activate our settings then we live in another dimension where people cannot understand us when the Gannon are far away when they can understand our behavior we would not understand addressing do not understand the way we speak because we are living in another dimension amen we use fit and the Christianity is based on fit whatever one does he need to do it by faith I believe this morning we came here by faith the Prophet said sometimes we go out to wake and we tell our wife let me go and come when you say how do you know you were coming back but by faith you said you are going and then you be coming but so they also go to the grocery store they said husband let me go to the shop and come they go and come they say oh this is by faith and a believer works by faith that not sight if we go back to the scripture we found out that God himself I call the prophet youssef it when he was creating the world the Prophet said he spoke the word and he believed it away is a letter delight and he delivered that word and it was making manifesting however what we say we need to believe it amen our confessions we have to believe it and as we believe it our body will obey our confession according to your faith if we say according to our Norfolk what are we trying to say we're trying to figure it out as a matter of individual faith according to my faith according to your faith when he returned people come to church and we see two people sitting alongside one another they may have problem and at the same ministry the same part of Richmond and maybe he will ask if you have any dress up your hand and the two of them eligible on the one who receive what IRA's be handful but the other one who not receive it is according to the effect so this morning I want us to activate our feet our us to believe what we are in for for by each God will do great things in our life and we are live in a time when you cannot make it with our faith maybe it would be different America been Africa some people have to walk several miles to come to church it is difficult when somebody has a kinda catch then we say is well to do like my church is only three people died after the rest have to walk and come to judge others have to drive on the our motorbike uses a brother currently the wife and two children at the back very dangerous but by faith to believe that God will bring them to church and the cottage and they go we need faith more in doing everything without faith you cannot make it and it's individual fate now somebody's faith when we come to Christ we need to have faith we don't come because maybe a brother came or a wife or somebody now if it is that way then it means that we are living by the shadow of somebody's face and when that fellow fails you feel wonderful about slight you but life it is an individual faith and what does this money to look at one or two people that demonstrated the effects Jesus Christ himself acquainted word of God must use faith to live and believe what was written of him he need to believe that way he died he'll be resurrected because the scripture said my holy one would not see corruption he need to believe it Jesus need to have faith hallelujah if Jesus and it fits how much more we we may need more faith than he needed faith according to your faith I want us to look at Abraham who was called from paganism and he separated himself he studied the journey of faith God gave him a promise and we know Abraham was an ordinary man like any one any of us that God called him and he responded to the call and he took off by the Liddy's of God by faith and anything he did he did it by faith finally God gave me a promise of a son the scripture said Abram continue believing God daily he might have is called the wife might have this curved they might make fun of him but Abraham continue believing God until about 25 years Sara took seat and gave to a baby boy according to the promise of God it was according to the fate of Abraham no one believed that on his behalf all those who were in those days who knew that Abraham has been given a promise and Sarah not being able to take seed might have this coffin making fun of him but Abraham continued to believe God he knew that he that has made a promise is able to fulfill his promise even though it tarries it will surely come to pass and Abram stood by his fate until the promise was fulfilled it was Abraham's faith amen when he gave us the scripture said it happened that God once they call him wanted to test his faith and ask him to go sacrifice Isaac his holy song that he took over 25 years to give them true God said I don't need anything for a sacrifice but I want Isaac many a times God who is a jealous God make sure that we don't put anything before him as I professed anything he put before God becomes an idol so God wanted to see the faith of Abraham whether he put int Isaac before him or not and a scripture said by faith Abram took off for where he was to sacrifice son and he went there said the author found a child even before Bonnie - editor asked him father where is the lamb for the sacrifice Abrams spoke my faith that God will provide himself a sacrifice I believe if we were there when God told him to use I said for a sacrifice would Ronnie's a liar but he spoke by faith he spoke as a believer you know believers must not be having negative thoughts no we must always have positive story the future as a man thinketh in his heart so he's so ready to speak by faith the scripture said when he finally was going to start his own NGO called him the second time is up Abraham I now know that you really believe in me you have obeyed me you did not deny using your son your only son for a sacrifice for me and God's Word by himself had him blessing I'm going to bless you and if we add the royalties of Abraham that we must live by the faith of Abraham a hallelujah according to your faith we found out here that Abraham did obey God by faith according to you of it Daniel in the land of bondage the scripture said his prayer people were offended because of his prayer and finally to stop him from praying you have to who counsel against our a Daniel the scripture said the Kings signed a decree that nobody should pray to any other God how do we know the story but Daniel by faith did not look at the decree Daniel by faith do not look at the danger that ahead we go whosoever disobey they decree of the king need to be thrown into the Lions then it need to be devolved by the Lions but Daniel believer his God knowing very well that window he continued frame him been arrested and thrown into the line of them his God will save him so he continued free in the scripture said the information went out he was arrested and he was thrown into the Lions Den thinking that before the following morning the lion would duvall him they behold they came to see Daniel have any a prayer meeting have any praises with the Lions the prophet said it was by faith he said he used the six things which is faith redness the Lord we eliminate time we have all that we needed to meet the rapture we have the message we have the Word of God it's really interpreted in two different languages the message has been interpreted in two different languages we have them at our disposal but what we need is to have faith in them the scripture said the Israelites did not reach the promised land because the gospel that was preached to them they did not miss it we need faith they did not believe it and because of that many of them were thrown in the wilderness God through them or kill them in the wilderness because what they believe it they cross without a free to them the message that was preached to them they did method with the effect they did not believe it it was done by it in otherwise they did not look at it the way God they betray his servants to preach it so God was no longer happy with them and they were thrown in the wilderness according to your faith amen the tree Hebrews they also use faith at a difficult time when all the believers in those days need to bow down to an image but they said we are not going to do it I know there might be other believers in those days or the Hebrews into this I was okay we we all know we are in a in bondage with an assailant why not we just sacrified do it and they won't go back on we go and put this right Shadrach Meshach Abednego they said no we are not going to do it they stood by the effect that even though our God did not serve us we know at a bit of resolution we are going to be resurrected it's according to fit my brother my sister this is the time of imitating somebody when they saw the time of infestation it's the time that you know God is dealing with you as an individual this is the time you should know your stand this assignment should know who the time you should know hallelujah then the father said if they said there is only one person in our area that is going to rupture you must be able to say you are that person and you cannot say this by with our faith it is a matter of faith you will serve this even though you have many child in your life you said this with maybe there are many things you are not able to do but you believe I couldn't the Word of God that once a bride of Jesus Christ and you were known before the foundation of the world and God made a way for you you will surely go if by faith hallelujah according to your faith Hannah who was born in Hades with another by faith when she was Miss Kaufman father by people one day when they came to church I would say they came to church like today I know she would not be the only boring person in that time after the church was closed she stayed behind by faith you are believer that if she could go before God in desperation praying got my wallet or something so she stayed behind and was praying the scripture said the priests head he had her nepeta but what is that making that way he came around to see he's Ohana I said oh maybe this woman might have drawn her he said I'm not run I'm pouring my heart to the Lord the promise that she prayed and then made a father that if God should give her a child she will in turn give the child to the Lord and because of that when God was going to give her a child God give her a boy and a prophet hallelujah because she's not at she did not as a selfish Lee God always look at our motives and our objectives because she asked and promised that if God give her a child he will tend give the child to God God the Prophet said give her a prophet hallelujah and behold she fulfilled her promise there are various times when we fire we make promises but when the time when God has done his part we find something funny difficult to do apart but that was not the case of Hannah ah ha really it was by faith many a times we go through certain difficulties setting her ships but will it fit to be able to come out of it not just saying it to people but believing God standing by the Word of God taking God holding God at His Word saying that that promise is fulfilled is according to your faith and individual faith jobbing is this private vendors to know that in his day there are so Bible but he lived by inspiration which today we have Bibles in different languages we have that grace but in the days of job they also have oh he lived by inspiration and the scripture said he pleased God and to God bless him when Adam was not happy with job until the Jordan ever went before the Lord trying to accuse oh because God has blessed him everything's going on well that is why he's worshipped in God and if God will allow that the devil who tempt him he would deny God that God didn't believe it he allow the devil to go I said don't touch his life and we know the life of showed his children is coddled all that he own order he asked was the destroy a job continue believe in the Lord it reach a place the wife who supposed to be the closest person to comfort him or encouraging the wife told her why not you just forget about God and die as a woman why do you speak like a foolish woman God has given and if he's taking work but I don't want him even though the scheming destroy my body I know one day that I'll see God and I'll see it for myself he spoke by French a scripture said it reach a place job could not stay among people they are to isolate him he has to be kept at a place where they does the trash they did that means the where they threw the trash that's why I was and there's nobody to help him maybe the broken stones that he finds what he used to scratch his body just to have a little tease little comfort but a scripture say he is truth know very well that no matter what happens he is God will never fail him it was by faith it was the fate of job another fit of the wife if we read the scripture well many of his friend might have accused him maybe you have a secrecy maybe I've done something wrong we don't believe that God can treat a child of God I did you know this statement would even worse than jobs a condition but he stood by his faith now looking at these accusations now looking at this and this discouraging words he believed that his God until the right time God has to move in short life it's according to the fit of job God cannot do nothing in a man's life without first believing it with our face have any faith in God and in the Word of God so we found out here that by the faith of job God protein all that was lost God healed him God changed the condition God made him a different person all together it was by his faith we need fit in everything that we are doing when effect to pray when affair to come to church when affect to meet our obligations as Christians because if you don't have faith you cannot do it I'm not talking about the number of years that you've been a Christian no I'm not against you but what famous at a particular situation at a particular time you need fit to demonstrate your Christianity the demonstrator you I believer to demonstrate a you're a brother of Jesus Christ to demonstrate and you know what you are doing fit individual fit when Jesus Christ was here or not a schedule made us to know that there was a Centurion that came to Jesus at one time this big man this general he approaches in a polite way he approaches us with respect even though he wasn't a believer the scripture said he knew that his sound that was sick Jesus who healed the son so when he came to Jesus he told uses and I am a big man I have people under my command when I say go there go when I said and they come I have servants and I watch you beat me there's no need for you to come to my house I only want you to see awake and my child will be healed and asleep I said this is look at this one except for this scene hallelujah and he went on to say the whole Israel have never seen such a type of it this is a great feat earlier but this morning God is not looking for a great faith is that if you have a faith like a mustard seed you could command mountains to move and they'll move and I don't believe this one that there's somebody whose problems are greater than a mountain and if we need a most acid fit to be able to move Mountain then we will need something small to move our problems earlier so we found out that this until Yin by his feet his child was with who not somebody's with he fit hallelujah maybe many people will have discouraged him when he was coming nearer but he believed ik and as he go to Jesus Jesus must really do something that is eternal we are living in according to your faith if we go further there was a woman who are suffering for a bloody shoe the scripture said she has pain all - she has just obtained healing and all attempt feel the one day away he had said that Jesus was having a meeting somewhere she came around when she till she did not go to the apostles did not go to anybody I said she broke protocol ago she has first aunty told her that if I'll be able to go touch the hem of His garment I'll be healed who taught her where did he learned it from she delivered it by faith earlier I promise that somewhere that's a Korea even a priest when the angel came and gave him promise even though he has imporant women the basepart that took seed he doubted but this woman they don't learn it from anybody it was by faith and the Prophet said this woman use the fact that was in Jesus Christ used the gibbet was in Jesus Christ a monk I used a gate is somebody you can use the gift that is in your posture the woman operated the gift that was in Jesus the prophecy that is why this has first week because the woman operated the gift as that way Jesus was saying that somebody has touched me he says man what he was saying because I never knew he only felt he was getting weak and then he started acid somebody has taught me a little where somebody has touched me Peter and the other disciple scenario Beauty will make a statement like this same people stepping on you pushing you bring all manner of this and you said somebody has taught you is a yes somebody has taught me because a virtue has gone out of me the filter search the omen came and knelt before him is that your faith has made you whole go in peace my doctor Alfred can transform our life our faith can lead us up to a higher ground effort can help us obtained healing according to your faith although we are talking about this morning faith is what we need in the Word of God yep that's what we need in our Christian life anytime there's a sermon preached the pastor preached a sermon you need faith to receive it you need faith to repent you need faith to put in right in your life according to your faith there was another woman the same profanation woman who's the tower sick I gave to Jesus that Jesus might have prayed for they tried to be healed or do something by Jesus would remind this woman until finally the disciples have to call the attention of Jesus the one ought to do something to this woman for who should find her wish his yes determine that following us he says then to the woman as a woman I want to tell you that children's bread cannot be given to dogs jailbreaker no big Negro and a promise I went Jesus made this statement the old man said I agree that I'm a dog I believe it but I have not come in for the children's bread but I know one thing when children eat the crumbs for on the ground so I've come for the crumbs if I can get the crumbs a mookee yes look at this you know this really effect is a real demonstration of it we need feet that statement I don't think I'd be made in the time that we are living in for a pastor to tell to make that statement to a church member ah they'll be fire they'll be fire now it has tend to call in your church member drugs but this woman by faith God revelation of what Jesus was saying and he responded and the scripture said Jesus did what she wanted to hear it was according to the fifth her faith hallelujah when I say aloud many a times we can support people with our faith but the more of it is individual must have it individual matter of it when the prophet studies me free will and the angel told him that if you can't let the people believe you if the people can believe you and many other way is praying for people the ask them do you believe me you believe me to be a son of a man of God do you believe before he prays for them he wants to see fit in them this morning I don't know who you are I don't know the problem that you have but if you can't have faith individual faith you will now go back home the same person something mishali happen in your life according to your feet amen there was a man who was blind by name but Hamas in the days of Allah Jesus praise the scripture said he goes to the roadside to beg for money well one day I went he was sitting at the normal place begging for money hear the noise then he questioned why is that not that for nothing not noise for I said is Jesus of Nazareth is coming they started crying at the top of his voice son of David have mercy on me people around him said Arabic you are making one right disturbing us we want a peace of mind he didn't even listen to them he continues shouting son of David I didn't know where the following I cannot see truly continues shouting shouting and a prophet said he's fed stop Jesus when Jesus arrived he stopped and also community between him and Jesus and finally Jesus asked him what do you want me to do is I want to see a well then Jesus said let it be a quality of it amen his faith stopped decided or the Prophet said and by his faith his eyes were opened if we read the story of Baltimore he was a believer because all the wind in his life every promise that he made he fulfill it even the lump that was leading him little play when he made a vow that he will use went you sacrifice a lump to God he did it even the priests try to discourage him from doing it the priest wanted to do to help him get another lamp is that no it's not a done is this lump Vera is feet and God honored our feet by having his eyes opened according to your faith amen I just look at the life of a prophet when he was ministering the message said he was invited to pray for a second woman and the message entitled fate is a sorceress and when he went to the room to go pray for the woman if honor that the woman was no half with faith when they were conversing he said you don't have faith almond used to be a Christian in a denomination affect the professor you don't have it and called the message there was a bracelet hanging there a prophet oh hey if you have it move that bracelet to this direction and bring it back again is that so possible how can a man do this and the master said the professor himself demonstrated the Prophet look at it and then the first light got off from weight was and him moving in there to the other direction and coming back again she was surprised what's astonish she has a prophet what it is it is God or the devil it's not God not as it is me faith does many things on you say this morning that there are many things that happens in a believers life is because of unbelief we call ourself Christians we come to check Norma we do other we supposed to do but we lack faith that is needed at a time to do something and as a result we go through different things but this morning let us come back to fit amen I remember they brought him a crippled girl to be prayed for and according to the message the prophet went nearer to the girl to pray for the girl by the Prophet found out that she was not having faith for the problem left a crippled girl and then continued with a prayer line and why he was doing it he had her faith mounted and was beating a perfect stop what he was doing came around a little pray for the girl and she was made whole they took her crutches away what we need is faith the professor where your first jobs is where you stopped and the way we are prayed for and you believe that you are healed when doubt come in the sickness may come back this morning if you lose your faith and you claim you are no longer a believer before tomorrow morning although you left some years ago you go back to them faith is what we need I remember when Jesus Christ was here let's keep harmony has to know that he walk on the sea to meet his disciples in the boat and when they saw him they were frightened think it was a ghost well I told them it is me do not be afraid because edifis you beat me to come and escape I said Peter started walking towards him they went he saw how the wind was written estamos Rouen he was gripped with fear and he was going to sink and he says took him by hand it will read further this I said is because of your little faith is because the fit that you would you started with you could not continue with the offense that is why I was thinking it was the same boat at the same water the same person but because he lose weight he was thinking my brother my sister my advice for you this morning is go through your faith go to the fete on the way go to the fete of the message the fate of the Word of God and you would make it individual fate hallelujah but at the time this was Medici support after taking the boat of Pizza and then he preached he wanted to recompense him so he asked them to go to see a scripture said Peter told him we have tried all night I am a fisherman to begin with I started fishing when I was young I know the science of fishing when there's going to be a good catch I know when there's not going to be a good coach I know I know the technique of fishing but we told you all night we couldn't get anything yes I said Peter you need to go so Peter replied nevertheless according to the wait I'll go amen Peter believer the word of Jesus Christ Peter took him by his word by faith and a scripture said when they went they had a easy catch until they could not bring it alone they are to invite other people to come and join them sometimes when we take God by his word and he blesses arts our brothers and our sisters also enjoy our blessing amen nevertheless according to the weight he had the heaviest catch they never had and he's relatively it was the same boat it was the same sea water it was the same net and it was the same people but he had a heavy catch is all fit this morning I don't want to go far but I want to encourage you with this short sermon faith is what we need we need to have faith in one another because of lack of faith in the church many churches are breaking many attend a church loses faith or stop believing is faster he will now start looking at his mistakes the fogger we are humans to begin with if you want to find fault you find many of them the progress that way you come to the church looking for a fault or mistake you find them if you come looking for blessing you'll find the muscle how do you say this morning when they reach a place a brother start condemning another brother a sister condemning her sister or the check condom in the oppressor or a church member condemning his father or the problem the source of the problem is lack of it he no longer have confidence in him he no longer threaten him and how can two walk together except they be agreed if you are affecting your wife you will suffer if you run a faith in your husband you will suffer when he goes to work you will be imagining things if he comes back late there's no skills he would give you for you to accept it my boss wanted me to do overtime my boss called me at dyeing time when I was about to go you call me to do this job before they said no no no no bill is because it offered sometimes you even be tempted to follow her to some places the Hadean have 30 min or hey what we need is faith if you are afraid we can be stable in whatever we are doing if we afraid will not be staggering if we afraid

humes from North Carolina was visiting them and it was not a service day and where the team was just going to come and see a church that you know the work they were doing in and he sent a word around before they got there by evening the tabernacle will fill but a team never went with Bible he was not going to preach but he had to preach because the people were there praise the Lord so yeah you know do unto others as you want them to do unto you I'm just quoting the scripture now amen but we appreciate the Word of God this money amen you know faith is the substance one of the substance that their faith produces in the life of the believer it makes you to believe you know know what you are doing amen and I will tell you that we here this morning I mean this Tabernacle this church and this church is going to remain here not in this place but remain as a church as long as God gave us people to believe what we are doing here amen we're not just making another Church here we are raising a body amen we are raising the body that we believe that we are investing in a lie of our self we are investing in the life of one another praise the Lord but Branham says you can you don't you will not be able to do anything right until you know what you are doing and that's why we we expect you know the musicians is just there to play music is to bring worship to the Lord the singers the songs every little leading the song as sober task at 40 in this morning bringing us into worship and sometimes we just sit there what it takes to raise your hands to the Lord praise the Lord you have to reload that like like old but alone he said he says God is our audience and we are we are the one that is honor he's the one that is watching us watching our attitude in worship it's all of those things that create faith all we come to do here is just to create an atmosphere of faith for people to receive the desires of their heart that's the thing that brings us to church on time that's the thing that brings us to church pray up that's the thing that brings us to church we come and we we prayed before the service stands and that is faith because faith with action is dead even our faith in God we have to believe he's a Living God we believe that he knows us he knows our our our form he knows what we are made out of and he will accept us just as we are that's the thing that make us to constantly goes to him praise the Lord amen let's keep believing in ourselves now we had the blood of Jesus Christ there's no rapture with us we are a New Testament church amen we are church that is set on the hill there is no time to hire our light praise the Lord we are already on the hill praise the Lord so the Lord bless you and I mean I just took down some little notes of encouragement year but you know as as brought john nation blonde bottommost let me share this with you maybe some of you people knew that i was listening to a message recently brother Branham was talking about Lamba Timo's and he started talking about Blom Bharti Muslim that led him and he says he says the reason why they use lamb those days because the Jews did not believe in dogs and I never saw that I I know that in the Old Testament and-and-and-and the price of a dog was abominable to the Jews but you see you see to be able to make sense of that over and over brother Branham talked down story how blond bottom was her alarm leading him I just wouldn't fit it in my mind how can the line lead a man he says those lambs were trained like dogs he said because they were dogs were abominable onto the juice man it just blew my mind you know that God dropped those things down it just bring a perfect honestly because Iran right in line with the scripture they will never bring the price of a dog to the house of God and now for the very same reason when Jesus told that woman I can give bread the children's bread to dogs now what was he calling the children's bread healing healing is the children's bread so if you are sick you must be able to go for the children's bread if you are a child of God you must believe God because healing is the children's bread so when he said I can take the children's bread and give it to dogs and that that was the thing that that their stool out to Jesus when a woman who except that she was a Gentile but yet the dogs can benefit from the crumbs praise the Lord so as brother John said that this money just just pop out in my mind and I just what I just got I just got a note that a little bit and remind myself amen praise the Lord how beautiful the Word of God is and the scripture says pressures are the feet of them that I bring the Word of God amen but we want to wish you a wonderful week amen and God you take our greetings dear to the brothers
