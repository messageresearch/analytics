[18:10] all right can you please um sit while we
[18:13] call on brother dan for a testimony
[18:15] brother then you are welcome
[18:29] praise the lord
[18:31] god bless your sins um i just want to
[18:33] give a testimony to the glory of god
[18:37] and uh for me to be here this morning
[18:41] is purely the grace of god amen
[18:44] i wouldn't probably have been able to
[18:46] make it in
[18:48] and if i did at all
[18:50] i probably would have come in either in
[18:52] clutches
[18:54] or in a wheelchair
[18:58] on
[18:58] friday morning i went to work
[19:02] and i was asked to put one machine
[19:04] together
[19:05] and there is um
[19:06] [Music]
[19:08] an infeed to that machine
[19:10] which weighs between 75
[19:13] and 80 pounds
[19:16] so i picked it up normally we use
[19:19] a hoist to raise it up but i was so much
[19:22] enhanced
[19:23] and that is how i've been doing it for
[19:25] the past four five years
[19:27] i lifted it and i put it on the platform
[19:30] the platform is about
[19:32] about this high
[19:35] and that is what i've always done
[19:37] and it was secure
[19:39] and i stood there for probably
[19:41] between 30 and 45 minutes
[19:46] with my back tent
[19:49] and i was scared in front
[19:52] and i tried to take this kid out of the
[19:54] way as soon as i took the skate
[19:57] and i took one two my third step
[20:01] i had a big bang behind me
[20:04] and when i turned
[20:06] that massive medal how it felt i don't
[20:10] know
[20:12] now brother johnny will bear me witness
[20:14] the whole floor is just nothing but
[20:16] still and concrete
[20:19] sometimes something would fall on
[20:20] another floor and you hear it
[20:23] you go there you don't see a dent
[20:25] but this one fell
[20:27] and left a mark
[20:29] on the concrete floor
[20:32] and
[20:33] i just started wondering
[20:36] how it felt
[20:37] and it just didn't fall i know when
[20:39] something falls
[20:42] it just probably i left it here
[20:45] and the thing came and landed here
[20:48] if there was somebody on the platform i
[20:50] would say maybe they lifted it
[20:52] and threw it against me which i have no
[20:54] cause to believe anybody anybody would
[20:55] do that
[20:58] and i saw the hand of god
[21:00] first hand
[21:02] because for that while i was standing
[21:04] there
[21:06] and i believe with all my heart if i had
[21:08] stood there for another ten five minutes
[21:10] that thing wouldn't fall because there
[21:12] was a hand that was holding it
[21:14] and so long as i was there it was not
[21:16] going to come down amen but as soon as i
[21:20] moved
[21:21] that thing it literally jumped
[21:24] it didn't fall it jumped and i was
[21:26] wondering if it had landed on my legs
[21:29] it would break it
[21:31] if it was on my back
[21:32] i was going to end up in a wheelchair
[21:34] there was no doubt
[21:35] because the tin is heavy
[21:38] we had to call a mechanic i called my
[21:40] manager
[21:41] and my supervisor they came over
[21:43] and they had to call a mechanic
[21:45] to come and stretch it bent
[21:47] that's infield bent they had to
[21:49] straighten it
[21:51] to be able to get it to fit in
[21:54] and the concrete floor
[21:56] left a mark so i was wondering what
[21:58] would happen to my body
[22:01] and you know
[22:02] shortly before that happened
[22:05] normally we have a little meeting in the
[22:07] morning and i raised the concerns
[22:10] and my manager just told me
[22:13] right up front
[22:15] that done it was god testing your
[22:17] patience
[22:19] your god was testing your patience
[22:21] and i just got stuck in my seat
[22:24] yeah i didn't say anything anymore it
[22:27] was the same manager again
[22:29] something happened about six months ago
[22:32] and when i was talking about it he said
[22:34] dan i don't know what to tell you
[22:36] but your god was with
[22:39] and you
[22:39] was wondering what was he going to say
[22:41] this time if this thing had fallen on me
[22:44] where was his god and that thing
[22:45] happened
[22:47] but praise be to god
[22:49] that he realized where my god was
[22:52] and i just want to give god the glory
[22:53] this morning
[22:55] amen
[22:59] it's together for jesus
[23:02] oh yes
[23:04] he is worthy to be praised
[23:07] amen

[1:01:35] that is their which
[1:01:38] are the children of the flesh

[1:01:51] the seed
[1:01:53] i want us to underline that word deceit
[1:01:56] the children of the promise

[1:02:32] any good or evil
[1:02:35] nothing they have done
[1:02:37] we were looking at full knowledge that
[1:02:39] it is not attached to what you will do

[1:02:48] what a good or evil that the purpose of
[1:02:51] god i call into election
[1:02:56] my stand
[1:02:59] not of works

[1:04:38] amen the lord bless you you may have
[1:04:40] your seat
[1:04:42] now now
[1:04:44] we started looking at this subject from
[1:04:46] wednesday night uh uh a little bit there
[1:04:49] on the birthright
[1:04:51] uh
[1:04:55] and we want to look we want to look back
[1:04:58] into that this uh
[1:04:59] this morning
[1:05:02] we
[1:05:04] uh trying to look at
[1:05:06] the right that the believers have amen
[1:05:10] and and how we obtain these rights
[1:05:19] the rights that the believers have and
[1:05:21] how we obtain this right
[1:05:23] now when you read the scripture year
[1:05:25] paul says here for it was said unto her
[1:05:28] that's rebecca
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:32] the elder shall save the younger then he
[1:05:34] said as it is written jacob i love in
[1:05:37] esau i hate genesis chapter 25
[1:05:40] because when you go to genesis chapter
[1:05:42] 25 you will never see where uh the
[1:05:45] scripture says jacob i love esau i hate
[1:05:49] but yeah the apostle paul taking that
[1:05:52] uh right there
[1:05:54] in the scripture and he's he's tying
[1:05:57] something
[1:05:58] he's he's actually dealing with
[1:06:00] something here
[1:06:02] uh uh that we want to study it a little
[1:06:04] bit
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:08] because if you if you just look at that
[1:06:10] you you might uh stumbled a little bit
[1:06:13] and and with all of these people that
[1:06:16] that keeps arguing about what they don't
[1:06:19] know about
[1:06:20] you know what what a prophet is
[1:06:30] praise the lord
[1:06:32] amen
[1:06:37] i was listening to uh
[1:06:39] god's prophet yesterday and he said
[1:06:42] uh something
[1:06:43] that just so blessed me as simple as it
[1:06:46] sounds
[1:06:47] and uh but you notice it's at a place
[1:06:49] where you are just thinking about
[1:06:51] something and then it comes through the
[1:06:53] wording and then you just feel so
[1:06:55] blessed about it he says the same gift
[1:06:58] that preached the word is the same gift
[1:07:00] that discern
[1:07:01] the house of the people amen
[1:07:04] praise the lord
[1:07:05] hallelujah and he says and then if you
[1:07:08] call me the prophet and then you say my
[1:07:10] teaching is wrong but my gift is right
[1:07:13] he says you don't know what a prophet is
[1:07:16] amen
[1:07:19] praise the lord
[1:07:21] genesis chapter 25
[1:07:23] we would like to look here back into the
[1:07:25] story
[1:07:26] of uh
[1:07:30] isaac
[1:07:31] and rebecca
[1:07:33] uh
[1:07:34] easter and jacob
[1:07:37] let's draw back a little bit here
[1:07:39] and
[1:07:42] verse 19 and these are the generations
[1:07:46] of isaac
[1:07:48] abraham's son i abraham beget isaac
[1:07:52] and isaac was
[1:07:54] 40 years
[1:07:56] or when he took rebecca
[1:07:59] to wife
[1:08:03] the daughter
[1:08:04] of betel
[1:08:06] the syrian
[1:08:07] of padan aram the sister of laban the
[1:08:11] syrian and isaac entreated the lord for
[1:08:15] his wife when i was studying this there
[1:08:17] was there was an information that uh
[1:08:19] that that i came came across and it was
[1:08:22] so blessed i kind of for bless my heart
[1:08:25] you know uh
[1:08:27] and a historian was looking at this
[1:08:29] thought isaac entreated his wife
[1:08:32] you know because she was barren and the
[1:08:35] lord
[1:08:36] and the law was entreated of him and
[1:08:39] rebecca his wife conceived and and and
[1:08:43] what uh uh the talk that was that was
[1:08:46] kind of edifying to me was that uh isaac
[1:08:50] took his wife back to the same mountain
[1:08:54] where abraham
[1:08:56] moriah's where abraham was going to
[1:08:59] sacrifice him
[1:09:00] and and and history says there were he
[1:09:03] entreated the lord
[1:09:06] praise the lord you can you can just see
[1:09:09] the the the level of inspiration that is
[1:09:11] in there i mean my mind was just blown
[1:09:13] my head my head swirled on my head if my
[1:09:16] hair looking big this morning then you
[1:09:17] have seen it it is from the effect of
[1:09:19] that
[1:09:21] praise the lord
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:24] you know that
[1:09:25] it's an art of inspiration
[1:09:28] it's not written in the book
[1:09:30] it's something that drops in your heart
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:35] it's something that drops in your heart
[1:09:38] and and you just do it you don't care
[1:09:41] you're not looking for the result but
[1:09:42] you just do it
[1:09:45] i mean to
[1:09:46] to to bring his wife to that very same
[1:09:48] spot
[1:09:50] and say lord god this was the place
[1:09:53] where my daddy tied me and offered me as
[1:09:55] a sacrifice unto you
[1:09:58] oh what an inspiration
[1:10:02] oh my goodness i can just stay on there
[1:10:04] this morning
[1:10:06] what an inspiration and isaac entreated
[1:10:09] the lord for his wife because she was
[1:10:12] barren
[1:10:13] and the lord was entreated of him
[1:10:16] and rebecca
[1:10:18] his wife conceived and the children
[1:10:20] struggled together within her
[1:10:23] and she said
[1:10:26] if it be so
[1:10:33] and she went
[1:10:34] an inquirer of the lord
[1:10:37] do you see the effect of what isaac did
[1:10:40] upon his wife
[1:10:42] he went and he treated the lord for his
[1:10:44] wife
[1:10:46] and and the lord visited his wife now
[1:10:49] she having her own a personal struggle
[1:10:52] she went back to the same god that that
[1:10:55] isaac prato
[1:10:59] she never went back to her husband and
[1:11:01] says what is happening to me
[1:11:04] the bible says she went back to the lord
[1:11:10] and said lord what is this
[1:11:14] because
[1:11:15] she's now honor the effect to know that
[1:11:18] it was because
[1:11:21] isaac entreated the lord
[1:11:24] she knows that that is the reason why
[1:11:26] god visited her
[1:11:30] praise the lord so whatever might be
[1:11:32] happening to her in this season of life
[1:11:36] god knows about it
[1:11:41] praise the lord
[1:11:43] amen
[1:11:45] are we together
[1:11:48] praise the lord
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:54] and the law said unto her
[1:11:57] two nations
[1:12:00] are in that womb
[1:12:02] and two mana of people
[1:12:06] shall be separated
[1:12:09] from that but i hope you ate something

[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:41] so she's here the lord said two nations
[1:12:44] are in that warm two minor of people
[1:12:47] shall be separated from thee
[1:12:49] now i i kind of stopped here
[1:12:52] because i want to i want i want to
[1:12:54] follow some thoughts that that that i
[1:12:56] wrote down
[1:12:58] uh
[1:12:59] and so i would not i would not be all
[1:13:01] over the place you know i end up all
[1:13:04] over the place anyway
[1:13:06] and uh
[1:13:07] and you've been very gracious to to bear
[1:13:09] with my mind of preaching
[1:13:11] that is very disorder
[1:13:14] but uh

[1:13:18] good church to make a good pastor
[1:13:21] it's how much you bear with him yes

[1:13:30] rebecca here
[1:13:31] that two nations will be in that womb
[1:13:34] now when god
[1:13:36] spoke to abraham
[1:13:38] god told abraham that he will be the
[1:13:41] father
[1:13:42] of missions yes
[1:13:45] praise the lord
[1:13:46] he will be the father of nations
[1:13:51] so we know it's many nations
[1:13:54] and then when god come here dealing with
[1:13:56] isaac and his wife
[1:13:59] he narrow it down to two nations
[1:14:04] praise the lord
[1:14:05] when god will go to jacob
[1:14:08] he will narrow it down to 12 tribes

[1:14:21] you see how
[1:14:23] uh uh
[1:14:24] and you watch this other principle in
[1:14:27] the scripture
[1:14:29] jesus
[1:14:32] when he when he taught on his parables
[1:14:35] he was says the lord of the harvest or
[1:14:37] the master of the house he came and he
[1:14:40] gives some
[1:14:42] sister fourth
[1:14:44] and some
[1:14:45] 84th and some hundredfold
[1:14:49] so the principle there is that
[1:14:52] it is always increasing
[1:14:55] is always getting better
[1:14:58] praise the lord
[1:15:00] the principle here is that god is
[1:15:03] narrowing his promise down
[1:15:06] he promised abraham to be the father
[1:15:09] of nations
[1:15:10] amen
[1:15:12] when it comes to isaac he said two
[1:15:15] nations
[1:15:16] are in that womb
[1:15:18] when it comes to jacob
[1:15:22] it became 12 tribes
[1:15:27] are we together
[1:15:34] whether
[1:15:35] it means anything to you
[1:15:38] just hold that brother brandon would say
[1:15:40] put it under the fifth rape
[1:15:44] you might need it in your journey
[1:15:46] praise the lord let's continue to go
[1:15:47] here he says and the lord said unto her
[1:15:50] two nations are in the womb two
[1:15:52] and two modern of people
[1:15:54] shall be separated from their boss and
[1:15:57] and the one people shall be stronger
[1:16:00] than the other people
[1:16:02] and the other shall save the younger
[1:16:06] praise the lord
[1:16:08] and and and when her days
[1:16:11] to be
[1:16:12] delivered was fulfilled behold
[1:16:16] there were twins in her womb
[1:16:18] now paul in romans
[1:16:22] that we read romans chapter 9 paul is
[1:16:25] referring to this this is the particular
[1:16:28] verse that paul is referring to and the
[1:16:30] law said unto her two nations shall be
[1:16:32] in the womb and the other shall save the
[1:16:36] younger
[1:16:39] and when her days were fulfilled
[1:16:44] when her days to be delivered was
[1:16:46] fulfilled behold there were twins in her
[1:16:48] womb and the first came out red now what
[1:16:51] what i want you to to to see here is
[1:16:54] that there is no record yet in genesis
[1:16:57] chapter 25 where the bible says jacob i
[1:17:01] love and ease or i hate
[1:17:05] it's in the scripture but it's not here
[1:17:07] in genesis chapter 25.
[1:17:14] but yes paul being the prophet
[1:17:19] he's taking the word
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:25] now
[1:17:27] let's go back
[1:17:29] to romans chapter nine let's pick up
[1:17:31] that verse again
[1:17:44] verse 12
[1:17:46] and it was said unto her
[1:17:48] and it was said unto her
[1:17:51] the other shall self
[1:17:54] the younger
[1:17:56] as it is written
[1:17:59] jacob i love
[1:18:01] but issa i hate so what paul is doing
[1:18:04] here as it was said unto her that's the
[1:18:07] spoken word
[1:18:09] as it is written that's the written word
[1:18:16] praise the lord
[1:18:18] you know a lot of these little things
[1:18:20] just
[1:18:21] entreats me you know you i mean you you
[1:18:23] you you just your mind get caught up in
[1:18:26] it
[1:18:27] and then and then sometimes you ruin
[1:18:29] your whole time aesthetic because you
[1:18:31] just get stuck to see how beautiful the
[1:18:34] scripture is
[1:18:35] praise the lord
[1:18:37] amen so there is nowhere yet in genesis
[1:18:40] chapter 25
[1:18:42] where jacob i love israel i hate will
[1:18:44] come up is in the book of malachi
[1:18:50] so paul was dealing with
[1:18:53] genesis to malachi
[1:19:00] are we together
[1:19:02] amen
[1:19:10] but the same law god that said the elder
[1:19:14] shall save the lord the younger i don't
[1:19:16] believe that it was it was it was a slip
[1:19:20] of mind that god couldn't say that
[1:19:23] a jacob loved israel ahead it was not a
[1:19:26] slip of mind it was not a slip of tongue
[1:19:28] that god couldn't say it yet to rebecca
[1:19:32] but it shows how the mind of god the
[1:19:36] thoughts of god are progressive
[1:19:40] praise the lord
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] if god
[1:19:45] like he says unto us you know there will
[1:19:48] be a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:19:52] that was a thought that he taught from
[1:19:54] the foundation of the world
[1:19:56] but that talk is progressive
[1:19:59] the people that would believe that word
[1:20:01] you know that and and and i would want
[1:20:03] to go in the rapture that would want to
[1:20:05] go in the body change
[1:20:08] it would take a lot of things for your
[1:20:10] body to change
[1:20:12] it will take some hard things
[1:20:15] now whether you really want to choose
[1:20:17] what i want this body change or let me
[1:20:19] just die
[1:20:24] that's the reason why the thoughts of
[1:20:25] god are seed
[1:20:28] they are seed
[1:20:30] and everything that the tree holds you
[1:20:32] see this this this uh old tree i don't
[1:20:35] even know what tree it is standing
[1:20:36] beside the building here uh with all of
[1:20:39] his branches almost getting dry
[1:20:41] came from a single seed
[1:20:58] let's travel
[1:21:02] and the first came out
[1:21:06] and the first
[1:21:08] came out red
[1:21:09] all over like a haired garment and they
[1:21:12] called his name ether
[1:21:16] and after
[1:21:18] that
[1:21:19] came his brother
[1:21:21] out in in his name and i mean in his
[1:21:24] hand took a hold of
[1:21:27] or heed
[1:21:28] and his name was called
[1:21:31] jacob
[1:21:33] the
[1:21:34] the jews would say jacob
[1:21:38] hakap that's a way to pronounce it
[1:21:40] i have not done my tongue surgery yet so
[1:21:46] i can't even pronounce my own name right
[1:21:52] and after that came his brother
[1:21:55] had his brother heed and they caught his
[1:21:57] name jacob
[1:21:59] and isaac
[1:22:00] was
[1:22:04] three school years
[1:22:06] old
[1:22:08] when she begged
[1:22:10] them praise the lord
[1:22:13] amen
[1:22:15] three school years
[1:22:17] which was uh
[1:22:19] 60 years
[1:22:21] am i right
[1:22:23] three scores should be 16.
[1:22:25] verse 20 says and isaac was 40 years
[1:22:29] when he took rebecca
[1:22:31] so he had to wait for the promise how
[1:22:33] many years
[1:22:35] 20 years
[1:22:42] and the boys grew and isa was a coney
[1:22:45] hunter
[1:22:47] a man
[1:22:48] of the field and jacob was a plain man
[1:22:52] dwelling in tents
[1:22:55] that also
[1:22:56] has a hidden meaning
[1:23:00] and i mean it's so it's so beautiful
[1:23:02] when you look at it through the word i
[1:23:04] mean it's just so beautiful
[1:23:06] jacob being the play man
[1:23:09] and he'd word intense
[1:23:12] he was
[1:23:14] a shepherd
[1:23:18] he was a shepherd
[1:23:21] now
[1:23:22] the
[1:23:23] the work of a shepherd
[1:23:32] was
[1:23:35] the bible says to the egyptians
[1:23:38] it was an abomination
[1:23:42] but to the hebrews
[1:23:45] the work of a shepherd
[1:23:48] for a son
[1:23:50] because their their inheritance were in
[1:23:53] katos
[1:23:55] that's where their riches were
[1:23:57] that's the reason why david said the
[1:23:59] lord had ten thousand cars on the hill
[1:24:03] just to be able to express god's wealth
[1:24:07] so to the hebrews
[1:24:10] a shepherd
[1:24:12] was one of the most trusted work
[1:24:17] for a father
[1:24:19] to take
[1:24:20] a a son and set him over the family
[1:24:25] inheritance
[1:24:28] that was the family inheritance
[1:24:32] a man in those days uh uh was was
[1:24:35] counted a wealthy man by
[1:24:38] his flocks
[1:24:41] flocks of sheeps or flocks of golden and
[1:24:43] and then and and the amount of hurts
[1:24:46] that he had
[1:24:47] so uh uh uh
[1:24:49] you know uh
[1:24:52] in one sense
[1:24:54] you will look at it as
[1:24:56] uh those days
[1:24:57] you can look at a shepherd as a lazy man
[1:25:02] all you have to do is lay down in a tent
[1:25:04] you know yeah lay down there and the
[1:25:06] sheep be eating
[1:25:08] so in another sense
[1:25:11] it was a it was a color job
[1:25:15] okay
[1:25:17] it was a color job
[1:25:19] a play man
[1:25:21] all you have to do
[1:25:24] i mean you you don't have to be telling
[1:25:27] the ground and you know you don't have
[1:25:29] to be you know running after no
[1:25:34] just create your sound
[1:25:35] come on come on
[1:25:40] so it was a cow turn job
[1:25:43] that's why they call him a plane
[1:25:45] [Laughter]
[1:25:48] oh man
[1:25:53] praise the lord
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:56] [Laughter]
[1:25:58] uh
[1:26:00] oh man
[1:26:04] isa was a corny hunter
[1:26:06] a man of the field a white man
[1:26:09] he was a wide man he was a brave man
[1:26:13] praise the lord
[1:26:15] but jacob
[1:26:20] was a plain man
[1:26:24] dwelling intent
[1:26:27] praise the lord
[1:26:30] say he's a lazy man he's just like off
[1:26:32] his job
[1:26:34] with air condition on
[1:26:44] let me get on the workers this morning a
[1:26:46] little bit
[1:26:50] praise the lord
[1:26:55] uh
[1:26:56] uh i'm taking my time because i want you
[1:26:58] to digest this i want you to i want you
[1:27:01] to start reading between the lines
[1:27:02] because they are just a lot of things
[1:27:04] right in that little nugget of the
[1:27:06] scripture
[1:27:08] amen there's just a lot of things in
[1:27:10] there in that little noggin of the
[1:27:12] scripture
[1:27:17] because you find the same thing with uh
[1:27:19] with with king and ibel
[1:27:22] okay king king is born and he have a
[1:27:25] desire to be a farmer to till the ground
[1:27:28] and let and yes yes abel year
[1:27:31] he's he's driving to be a shepherd boy
[1:27:36] amen
[1:27:37] now the thing about it there is that
[1:27:40] brother branham who says i think even
[1:27:42] made clear by prophecies that uh uh that
[1:27:47] that even the the gift of a man
[1:27:50] is tied to his nature
[1:27:54] amen
[1:27:56] that the gift of a man is tied to his
[1:27:59] nature
[1:28:01] i mean a man
[1:28:03] cannot be uh uh uh uh an evangelist
[1:28:09] and and and i mean he's he's as quiet
[1:28:12] and slow like me
[1:28:16] that's too contrary nature
[1:28:21] i mean
[1:28:23] that's too contrary nature so the the
[1:28:26] the line of thought here is the other if
[1:28:29] uh if if abel
[1:28:32] choose the career if he if he was
[1:28:35] driving something in him was driving him
[1:28:38] to be a shepherd ball and and and it is
[1:28:41] the the the family inheritance is is is
[1:28:44] there in in shepherds it's not in the
[1:28:47] field it's not in the plants it's it's
[1:28:49] right there what was it
[1:28:52] that created that desire
[1:28:59] the same thing here with isa and jacob
[1:29:03] he's a born and and and and he being you
[1:29:07] know uh
[1:29:08] a wide man and he's he's in the field
[1:29:11] and doing all of that but here is jacob
[1:29:14] here born in his desire
[1:29:17] his driving ambitions
[1:29:20] is to be able to take care of the family
[1:29:22] inheritance
[1:29:27] which of course by law must go toward
[1:29:29] the first born
[1:29:37] am i confusing you
[1:29:40] are you lost
[1:29:42] in the conversation
[1:29:45] praise the lord
[1:29:48] so
[1:29:49] what i'm trying to establish here is
[1:29:51] that there is an intelligence
[1:29:54] there is a divine intelligence that is
[1:29:57] placing
[1:29:58] that is placing each of these sounds
[1:30:02] that they are not they are not even in
[1:30:03] control of it
[1:30:08] that divine intelligence that wrote
[1:30:10] their dna
[1:30:14] and put right in their dna they kind of
[1:30:16] for nature the kind of a gift that they
[1:30:19] will have
[1:30:25] praise the lord
[1:30:27] now you have to keep on the back of your
[1:30:28] mind now we've been talking about full
[1:30:30] knowledge
[1:30:41] so i wanted us i wanted you to grab that
[1:30:43] as we go along
[1:30:44] and isaac
[1:30:46] love easer
[1:30:49] because he did eat off his venison
[1:30:52] but jacob loved
[1:30:54] i mean rebecca loved jacob
[1:30:57] praise the lord
[1:31:01] we read from left to right i'm reading
[1:31:03] from right to left
[1:31:09] now here the scripture
[1:31:11] will be able to expose
[1:31:14] one of uh mankind problem
[1:31:17] family line
[1:31:19] where it's it exposed something here in
[1:31:22] the patriots that even in their family
[1:31:25] you know there was some sense of
[1:31:26] favoritising
[1:31:28] which of course parental favoritism
[1:31:32] to the children
[1:31:34] it has a way of of bringing him
[1:31:38] praise the lord
[1:31:39] amen
[1:31:40] sometimes
[1:31:46] sometimes
[1:31:48] you know uh it's easy for people to be
[1:31:50] out of the out of the fence and look in
[1:31:52] the fence and says well i think i think
[1:31:54] yeah i think he loved this child more
[1:31:56] than that child in that child more than
[1:31:58] their child
[1:31:59] okay
[1:32:01] and uh
[1:32:02] but you you will see that
[1:32:05] you know uh uh
[1:32:07] a right through
[1:32:08] the the first family
[1:32:10] god expressing his love never show
[1:32:14] favoritising
[1:32:16] to his children
[1:32:18] praise the lord
[1:32:20] when he came down he made provision both
[1:32:22] for adam and eve
[1:32:24] yes the lamb that was slain on the east
[1:32:26] side of eden was enough
[1:32:29] to cover both of them
[1:32:32] praise the lord
[1:32:34] amen
[1:32:36] but what we we see in abraham family we
[1:32:39] can see a little bit of that
[1:32:41] but
[1:32:42] there was something that abraham
[1:32:44] possessed
[1:32:45] that that the high god to look above all
[1:32:48] of that and what abraham possessed
[1:32:50] genesis recalled is that he will be able
[1:32:54] to teach his children whatever god shows
[1:32:56] him whatever god revealed to him he will
[1:32:59] be able to pass it down to his children
[1:33:02] praise the lord it was one of the things
[1:33:04] that created a very great friendship
[1:33:06] with with god and abraham
[1:33:08] because uh uh
[1:33:10] uh you know uh uh
[1:33:13] god he's not a gossiper
[1:33:16] you know
[1:33:18] gossiper will always see he at gossip
[1:33:21] where we say this is between me and you
[1:33:26] they will even forget that god is
[1:33:27] listening
[1:33:29] this is between me and you
[1:33:31] just me and you
[1:33:34] but god is not a gossiper
[1:33:36] you know for so when he recognized that
[1:33:38] the the the fat the ability in abraham
[1:33:42] to be able to pass on whatever he he
[1:33:44] taught him or whatever he revealed to
[1:33:47] him and that is the secret to be able to
[1:33:49] receive from god to receive from god is
[1:33:52] to also have the ability to share
[1:33:55] amen
[1:33:57] praise the lord
[1:33:58] is to have the ability to share if you
[1:34:01] cannot share god can i give you
[1:34:03] more
[1:34:04] praise the lord
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:08] so we see here but we can also see that
[1:34:11] there were there were some things that
[1:34:13] is that that you know that
[1:34:15] that contribute to dice
[1:34:17] one of the things i would think that
[1:34:18] contribute to it the bible says right
[1:34:21] here that uh because isaac loved the
[1:34:24] venison that isa was bringing him it was
[1:34:27] not it was not just the venison you know
[1:34:30] but it was more for the fact that this
[1:34:33] was his firstborn son
[1:34:36] and and for the fact that the firstborn
[1:34:38] son was now
[1:34:40] paying attention because because you
[1:34:42] have to understand adoption you know the
[1:34:45] father is looking for this boy that that
[1:34:49] that that is able to show an ability of
[1:34:52] governing
[1:34:54] so for the fact that
[1:34:56] isa now was paying attention to his dad
[1:35:00] he goes out and and and just from a
[1:35:02] little boy you know he goes and hun and
[1:35:04] pretty soon as now he comes his first
[1:35:07] mate the first person he thinks about is
[1:35:09] his dad so that attracts the father
[1:35:14] because he's the firstborn and and and
[1:35:17] and and and he's playing uh uh uh a
[1:35:21] certain role of responsibility to the
[1:35:23] father
[1:35:27] praise the lord
[1:35:28] now but rebecca on her side
[1:35:31] was what the injured of the lord told
[1:35:34] her
[1:35:38] praise the lord
[1:35:43] she's she's hiding that thing in her
[1:35:45] heart because she knows what the law
[1:35:47] says
[1:35:52] there is there is no there is no way now
[1:35:55] she can start to push this thing in in
[1:35:58] isaac house and says uh you know i mean
[1:36:01] uh the law already told me that the
[1:36:03] younger one was said that the older one
[1:36:04] so i don't care what you're doing and
[1:36:06] this is that is just going to divide the
[1:36:08] family
[1:36:11] so being a woman she held that in her
[1:36:13] heart and she started watching that
[1:36:16] younger one
[1:36:17] keeping her eyes on him
[1:36:23] praise the lord
[1:36:34] and jacob
[1:36:38] saw partage and isa came from the field
[1:36:41] and he was fainting jesus said unto
[1:36:43] jacob femi i prayed him with the same
[1:36:46] real partage for i am faint
[1:36:49] therefore
[1:36:52] was his name called edom
[1:36:57] and jacob said
[1:36:59] sell me
[1:37:01] this day
[1:37:02] that breath right
[1:37:05] praise the lord
[1:37:06] amen
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:08] tell me this day that breath right
[1:37:11] now
[1:37:13] as we were reading you know read some
[1:37:15] quotes here we'll realize that you know
[1:37:17] brother brandon says all he wanted was
[1:37:19] the birthright now the thing about it
[1:37:21] there is that uh for you to pause and
[1:37:24] think about is that
[1:37:26] what in him created that desire
[1:37:30] destiny
[1:37:33] what created that desire
[1:37:36] i mean it was easy for him to say well i
[1:37:38] gave you venison i mean i gave you
[1:37:40] protest you gave me the venison
[1:37:44] you know the venison you cook for for
[1:37:46] for daddy give me a good part of it and
[1:37:49] i gave you
[1:37:52] some of mine
[1:37:55] but why so soon
[1:37:57] what inside of him is driving him to the
[1:38:00] breath right
[1:38:04] it's not his choice
[1:38:06] it's a divine command
[1:38:08] it's a divine decreed
[1:38:10] it was not your choice
[1:38:16] amen
[1:38:19] amen
[1:38:24] we try to make this thing order by
[1:38:25] ourself
[1:38:35] and jesus said behold
[1:38:38] i'm at a point to die
[1:38:41] and what
[1:38:42] what it
[1:38:44] shall this breath right do to me
[1:38:47] and jacob says word
[1:38:49] to me in this day
[1:38:50] and he swore unto him
[1:38:52] and he sold his birthright onto jacob
[1:38:56] then then
[1:39:00] jacob
[1:39:01] gave ease of bread and pottage of
[1:39:02] blingtail
[1:39:04] and he did eat and drunk and rose up and
[1:39:08] went his way
[1:39:10] he did eat
[1:39:12] and drunk and rose up you know jesus
[1:39:15] pick up their attitude
[1:39:17] of of the people in the days of noah
[1:39:20] eating and drinking rising up to plane
[1:39:24] amen
[1:39:25] god there with the children of israel
[1:39:27] when they were called to the moabites
[1:39:30] and they got into that feast
[1:39:32] of bioporo eating and drinking
[1:39:35] there there is
[1:39:38] there is there is a scriptural sense
[1:39:40] that goes with that
[1:39:42] amen
[1:39:43] the scriptural sense that goes with that
[1:39:46] is the other
[1:39:47] is it's a careless attitude
[1:39:52] praise the lord it's a careless attitude
[1:39:56] and and a selfish one that shows where
[1:40:00] people are they just they are just all
[1:40:02] about himself
[1:40:06] well i don't care for anybody i just
[1:40:08] want to do me
[1:40:14] the people ate
[1:40:15] they drunk
[1:40:17] and they rose up to play
[1:40:20] there is something about that attitude
[1:40:24] that god
[1:40:26] frowns on
[1:40:33] praise the lord
[1:40:35] it's an attitude where the people go by
[1:40:38] oh all they are about is us i mean we
[1:40:42] can bring it right down to our dating
[1:40:44] age
[1:40:45] amen all that they are about
[1:40:49] it's just uh uh i mean about themselves
[1:40:55] that's what they're about it's all about
[1:40:57] himself
[1:41:08] the people that are going with
[1:41:10] how they are they're not even having god
[1:41:13] on their mind they're not even they're
[1:41:14] not even thinking about him
[1:41:17] they have no no concern about the lord
[1:41:20] nothing
[1:41:21] they are all orders just themselves
[1:41:27] praise the lord
[1:41:28] the bible says
[1:41:31] and he did eat and he drank and he rose
[1:41:34] up and went his way
[1:41:37] now see there now that attitude of just
[1:41:40] eating drinking going about
[1:41:45] just yourself
[1:41:48] just
[1:41:49] dust
[1:41:50] means there by doing that
[1:41:56] he despised
[1:42:00] his breath right
[1:42:04] does
[1:42:05] by doing that
[1:42:07] by having that kind of attitude
[1:42:13] of not even
[1:42:15] considering god in your steps
[1:42:18] in your choices
[1:42:21] in your meaning your second your hour
[1:42:30] he can he he was ready to do whatever he
[1:42:33] wanted to do just to get his fleshly
[1:42:36] desire satisfied
[1:42:44] he can work overtime
[1:42:48] just to get his fleshly desire satisfied
[1:42:52] thus
[1:42:54] he despised
[1:42:56] his breath right
[1:43:03] oh i'm praying this morning that the
[1:43:04] holy spirit
[1:43:06] will just speak audibly to your heart
[1:43:16] thus
[1:43:17] he despised
[1:43:20] his breath right
[1:43:23] when he despised his birthright he
[1:43:25] didn't fall on the ground and die
[1:43:28] when he despised his birthright he never
[1:43:30] got cancer
[1:43:32] he was still a strong man that could go
[1:43:34] out and do what he wanted to do
[1:43:39] praise the lord
[1:43:41] you know you think about this and you
[1:43:42] think about people
[1:43:44] you know blasphemy and they are saying
[1:43:46] all sorts of things about
[1:43:48] christ and god and you know and about
[1:43:52] about god's word of the hour and and the
[1:43:55] prophet of the hour and sometimes you
[1:43:57] know uh uh we turn to being like uh the
[1:44:00] sons of thunders and you just think well
[1:44:02] fire can't come down and consume them
[1:44:04] you know there's a biblical principle
[1:44:06] jesus in in a word says that
[1:44:10] uh in that day you know anything that is
[1:44:13] said again the son of man
[1:44:15] will
[1:44:16] not be
[1:44:18] forgiving
[1:44:20] jesus did not say if you say anything
[1:44:23] against the son of man when he's working
[1:44:25] in his church i will strike you to death
[1:44:32] praise the lord amen
[1:44:34] so sometimes you find people trying to
[1:44:37] look for vindication they says well if
[1:44:40] i'm if i'm not a if i'm not a servant of
[1:44:42] god let god strike me to there is
[1:44:44] nowhere in the scripture where god said
[1:44:45] he will strike you today
[1:44:48] but he said if you blaspheme it will not
[1:44:50] be forgiving you
[1:44:52] in this word
[1:44:54] or the word to come
[1:44:56] so you will go on prospering
[1:44:59] you will be healthy you will get rich
[1:45:03] but it will not be forgiving you
[1:45:14] and people can make those kind of for
[1:45:17] authoritative statement if i'm wrong let
[1:45:20] god struck me to death
[1:45:23] and everybody looking at him okay god
[1:45:24] struck him today now
[1:45:28] and when he when he stayed moving on the
[1:45:30] man was right
[1:45:32] the man was right
[1:45:43] almighty god is not your toy
[1:45:47] god is not your playboy
[1:45:54] praise the lord
[1:45:58] he says anything said against the son of
[1:46:00] man will be forgiven
[1:46:02] but when the holy spirit
[1:46:04] will come in this church
[1:46:06] one word
[1:46:08] said against it
[1:46:10] will not be forgiving do you see why
[1:46:12] many would turn up
[1:46:15] and realize
[1:46:19] that all of this why they've been having
[1:46:22] unconfessing in their lives
[1:46:28] you see why brother branham said
[1:46:29] unconfessed sin can make this church to
[1:46:31] fail
[1:46:40] because people can sit right in their
[1:46:43] seats
[1:46:44] and they know how to throw hinge
[1:46:49] they know how to challenge you in their
[1:46:51] mind without saying the word
[1:46:56] the easy thing to do if you have a
[1:46:57] problem just write it down after the
[1:47:00] service meet the brother meet the
[1:47:02] preacher you say this
[1:47:03] you know can you clarify it
[1:47:06] that's right amen
[1:47:11] because the holy spirit can be driving a
[1:47:13] man to deal with certain things and a
[1:47:15] man can say something boring in that
[1:47:18] channel and you now with the message
[1:47:20] book in your head
[1:47:24] you can be able to line up all the cuts
[1:47:27] where he's out of order
[1:47:40] you just think about all the people that
[1:47:41] can get on the internet and and saying
[1:47:44] all of these things
[1:47:46] and yet their heart is still beating in
[1:47:48] their chest they wake up in the morning
[1:47:51] they don't feel any different
[1:47:54] so they feel vindicated if i was wrong
[1:47:56] god would have struck me dead
[1:47:59] there is nowhere in the scripture
[1:48:11] but that attitude
[1:48:14] he despised
[1:48:16] his birthright
[1:48:20] he never got sick
[1:48:22] he never got cancer
[1:48:25] man he finished eating his stomach was
[1:48:27] fought on his way he went
[1:48:29] he went jumping from one tree to another
[1:48:32] tree
[1:48:33] from one city to another vacation spot
[1:48:37] trying to look for a trophy
[1:48:40] trying to do something to impress his
[1:48:42] father
[1:48:44] for all of those times
[1:48:46] he was walking out of the way of god
[1:49:01] okay let's get into our scripture this
[1:49:03] morning now get into our subject this
[1:49:05] morning the lord will be able to help us
[1:49:07] here
[1:49:14] be the name of the lord amen
[1:49:17] amen
[1:49:19] on wednesday night
[1:49:21] talking about this
[1:49:24] i said that the subject of birthright
[1:49:26] never
[1:49:27] came up in the first
[1:49:29] twins
[1:49:31] kingdom
[1:49:34] and
[1:49:36] because we know
[1:49:38] they were of they were of separate
[1:49:39] fathers
[1:49:41] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:49:42] birthright was not an it was not a
[1:49:44] subject
[1:49:46] but you will realize that
[1:49:48] there is a mystery
[1:49:52] of the first twins and the second twins
[1:49:57] praise the lord
[1:49:58] the mystery of the first twins
[1:50:01] is two seed
[1:50:04] planted
[1:50:05] in the same womb
[1:50:08] two seed planted in the same earth
[1:50:17] praise the lord
[1:50:20] the mystery of the second twins oh my
[1:50:23] goodness
[1:50:25] oh praise the lord
[1:50:27] hallelujah
[1:50:29] oh thank you jesus
[1:50:31] thank you jesus
[1:50:34] the mystery of the second twins
[1:50:37] is
[1:50:41] two seed
[1:50:43] coming from the same one
[1:50:49] am i saying the same thing
[1:50:55] praise the lord amen the mystery of the
[1:50:57] first twins is two seed
[1:51:01] planted in the same earth
[1:51:07] praise the lord
[1:51:09] two seed let me go a little bit further
[1:51:12] amen
[1:51:14] that i won't confuse you two seed from
[1:51:17] two different planters
[1:51:19] planted in the same earth
[1:51:22] the mixture of the second twins is
[1:51:27] two seed
[1:51:29] from one planter
[1:51:31] coming out of the same earth
[1:51:34] [Music]
[1:51:36] praise the lord
[1:51:38] now you will see why
[1:51:40] jesus when he taught matthew chapter 13
[1:51:44] he says these are mysteries
[1:51:51] these are mysteries secret
[1:51:53] hidden from the foundation of the word
[1:51:58] and when jesus was talking about
[1:52:01] matthew chapter 13 he was talking about
[1:52:04] the soul went out to soul
[1:52:07] praise the lord
[1:52:10] and then in another parable that is tied
[1:52:12] to that he said there was one sower that
[1:52:15] came in a night and saw
[1:52:17] the turs
[1:52:20] and the owner of the field came and he
[1:52:22] saw the seed
[1:52:25] and the both of them grew together
[1:52:29] and when that when when the liberals of
[1:52:30] the field started they said whoa whoa
[1:52:32] whoa whoa whoa what's going on here
[1:52:35] he said leave it
[1:52:38] leave it
[1:52:39] let them grow
[1:52:41] together yes
[1:52:51] so we have something here
[1:52:56] that
[1:52:57] is plain out in scripture
[1:53:01] but then we know that is god bringing
[1:53:04] out his great
[1:53:06] mystery from his mind
[1:53:16] praise the lord
[1:53:18] that's the reason why
[1:53:20] uh uh uh uh
[1:53:23] king and evil's
[1:53:25] will be uh
[1:53:27] uh uh the the subject the subject of
[1:53:29] separate sea will be the subject of
[1:53:32] argument
[1:53:34] but yet it is one of the subject that
[1:53:37] will always grab the illege
[1:53:43] it will always grab
[1:53:46] the illeg
[1:53:49] when you come on the subject of serpent
[1:53:52] seed sometimes
[1:53:54] great theologians
[1:54:00] well my little uh
[1:54:01] uh
[1:54:02] research i like i like to look into what
[1:54:05] people think about setting subject
[1:54:08] and you find men that are i mean they
[1:54:11] they are they are scalars
[1:54:15] they are scalars that i mean there's uh
[1:54:18] there is a guide i like to to look into
[1:54:20] a commentary from from one adam i mean
[1:54:23] he's a he's uh uh he's he's a scalar i i
[1:54:26] like the way he does his research
[1:54:28] because he and by but yeah there are
[1:54:30] places where you find that they still
[1:54:32] struggle with this
[1:54:37] they still struggle with the
[1:54:39] understanding on trinity
[1:54:45] praise the lord
[1:54:48] i mean in as much as the the the illite
[1:54:54] they rejoice over this
[1:54:57] but even this very same subject
[1:55:01] it captured other people into the ranks
[1:55:04] of the message
[1:55:05] that are still not illeg
[1:55:09] they see it wow
[1:55:10] it brings them in because they need to
[1:55:13] be there to create problems for us
[1:55:20] when you preach separate see they are on
[1:55:22] your feet
[1:55:23] [Applause]
[1:55:27] the mess freedom is
[1:55:32] when you start identifying the character
[1:55:33] racist of the serpency
[1:55:38] then he said you're preaching to them
[1:55:48] praise the lord
[1:55:50] so we see two seeds
[1:55:54] in genesis beginning that is planted in
[1:55:56] the same earth
[1:56:03] but as you progress
[1:56:08] we see
[1:56:12] one seed planted
[1:56:14] in two different characteristics coming
[1:56:16] out
[1:56:19] praise the lord
[1:56:21] i can hold you the whole morning on that
[1:56:22] thought
[1:56:23] spare bound
[1:56:25] and we can run it through the scripture
[1:56:27] and you will see that god's word is
[1:56:29] perfect in every way
[1:56:38] i'll spare you some time
[1:56:42] the the two seeds that were planted
[1:56:45] in the beginning
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:50] from
[1:56:51] two different planters
[1:56:58] praise the lord
[1:57:01] from two different planters that's the
[1:57:03] seventh seed
[1:57:05] and the original seed spoken word is the
[1:57:08] original sea
[1:57:11] there was a sea that god said every sea
[1:57:13] will bring four of its kind
[1:57:17] but there was a serpent sea
[1:57:20] that was planted also in the same field
[1:57:24] praise the lord amen
[1:57:26] [Music]
[1:57:28] and and brought forth two
[1:57:32] with different characteristics but what
[1:57:34] you will realize here is
[1:57:37] the acceptancy
[1:57:39] verb says this body of yours is
[1:57:42] breathing between the serpent and eve
[1:57:47] our sinful nature is breathing between
[1:57:51] the serpent your anger is a breed
[1:57:53] between uh the serpent and eve that's
[1:57:56] where you got it from
[1:57:58] it's not from god
[1:58:02] even when when elisha called the bed on
[1:58:05] those children it was not from god
[1:58:09] it was something that was breeded
[1:58:11] between the serpent and he that anger
[1:58:14] but yet god honor it
[1:58:22] now we will realize that as time
[1:58:24] progressed after the flood
[1:58:27] a new covenant
[1:58:30] a new covenant has been made through the
[1:58:33] fire our father abraham
[1:58:35] but you see
[1:58:38] the the the two seeds that were planted
[1:58:40] in the beginning
[1:58:42] uh uh uh uh the the the seed of the
[1:58:45] second was not destroyed the seed of the
[1:58:47] serpent came through the fl came through
[1:58:49] the flood
[1:58:51] it survived the floor they came on the
[1:58:53] other side
[1:58:56] we see neram growing up to be a man of
[1:58:59] defined
[1:59:00] when the bible say he was a mighty
[1:59:02] hunter it means that he was a man that
[1:59:05] was defined against anything called god
[1:59:12] praise the lord
[1:59:14] so now
[1:59:16] god that's the reason why when
[1:59:18] when paul speaks here in romans he talks
[1:59:21] about the children of the promise
[1:59:24] that goes back to the seed
[1:59:33] praise the lord
[1:59:35] god is now going to show how on a new
[1:59:40] covenant
[1:59:42] from the same father
[1:59:45] two seas will come out of the womb
[1:59:48] one that would be athlete
[1:59:53] and the other one
[1:59:55] will be spiritual
[2:00:00] are we together
[2:00:03] amen
[2:00:04] am i being too loud
[2:00:08] am i yelling at you
[2:00:12] praise the lord
[2:00:14] amen
[2:00:17] because
[2:00:19] we we we have to understand
[2:00:23] you know better brandon would travel
[2:00:25] like this and tell us a masterpiece
[2:00:28] how
[2:00:29] when the image of god god image that he
[2:00:32] built in in the garden of eden was
[2:00:34] thrown down
[2:00:36] by unbelief
[2:00:38] god started to build a new image from
[2:00:40] the new covenant and he had to build
[2:00:44] four principal cornerstones
[2:00:47] the first cornerstone was abraham by
[2:00:49] faith
[2:00:50] god was going to sto to establish a
[2:00:54] soviet uh foundation by faith
[2:00:59] in a man called abraham
[2:01:02] praise the lord
[2:01:04] and then
[2:01:05] when he moved on to isaac
[2:01:08] he will be the man of love
[2:01:11] all the greatest romance story of isaac
[2:01:15] waiting in the field and rebecca
[2:01:17] coming on on on the camera
[2:01:22] god
[2:01:23] will establish a foundation of love
[2:01:28] unconditional love
[2:01:32] praise the lord
[2:01:34] then he will establish in isaac
[2:01:38] and then when it comes to jacob he will
[2:01:40] be the cornerstone of grace
[2:01:43] [Laughter]
[2:01:45] he will be
[2:01:47] god is laying a cornerstone because he's
[2:01:50] going to build another masterpiece on
[2:01:52] this cornerstone that would never been
[2:01:54] thrown down
[2:01:56] that no matter what unbelief comes what
[2:01:59] a doctorate system comes and all the
[2:02:02] forced doctrine it would never true god
[2:02:05] caused i mean uh masterpiece down
[2:02:09] this other masterpiece that he's
[2:02:11] building on this full
[2:02:13] sonic foundation
[2:02:15] and jake and joseph
[2:02:17] will be the cornerstone of perfection
[2:02:21] so god have
[2:02:23] one
[2:02:24] faith
[2:02:25] isaac love
[2:02:27] jacob
[2:02:29] grace
[2:02:31] joseph perfection
[2:02:33] and on this
[2:02:35] he obey
[2:02:36] the patriots
[2:02:38] the prophets
[2:02:39] the kings
[2:02:41] then he comes to the church
[2:02:44] the
[2:02:44] bride right into the rapture
[2:02:55] praise the lord
[2:02:58] are we together
[2:03:05] so right in here we can see
[2:03:08] that even when the floor came and man
[2:03:10] became wicked and god the straw man of
[2:03:12] the wickedness
[2:03:14] but there was a blending already
[2:03:17] there was a mixing
[2:03:21] a mix in between the serpent seed
[2:03:25] there was a blood
[2:03:27] a mix of blood
[2:03:31] amen
[2:03:32] that was already going to travel down
[2:03:35] through the age
[2:03:37] are we together
[2:03:39] so god here now
[2:03:41] under his foundation of grace he's
[2:03:44] bringing out a mystery that his people
[2:03:47] would catch in the last day that was the
[2:03:49] reason why paul
[2:03:51] went back to that
[2:03:58] rebecca says what did what is thus
[2:04:02] a type of the church
[2:04:04] experiencing two seeds
[2:04:06] honor that brother branham says every
[2:04:08] revival produced at twins
[2:04:14] she's feeling this in her womb
[2:04:18] now they are of the same father now if
[2:04:20] they were a different father you can say
[2:04:21] yeah they want a separate the king's
[2:04:24] children oh this other one here is able
[2:04:26] children but now they are of the same
[2:04:28] father
[2:04:30] how are we going to tell
[2:04:34] how are we now going to distinguish
[2:04:42] praise the lord
[2:04:48] glory be to god
[2:04:51] amen
[2:04:53] that's the reason why the race is not to
[2:04:55] the swift
[2:04:57] but he that endureth to the end amen
[2:05:01] shall be saved
[2:05:04] praise the lord

[2:08:51] and say well
[2:08:52] if the fellow could see and understand
[2:08:56] he did look and say well

[2:09:05] the place here comes i'll find me
[2:09:08] he he will just knock knock me in the
[2:09:11] head

[2:09:56] if the mother
[2:09:57] is rightly instructed if she's now
[2:10:01] feeding off of facebook
[2:10:03] but she's feeding off of the book of
[2:10:05] life
[2:10:09] she will say but wait a minute son
[2:10:12] let me tell you something
[2:10:14] the priests will never see you
[2:10:19] by the man of the house when he comes
[2:10:22] out this morning
[2:10:24] and see you
[2:10:26] were born under a breath right because
[2:10:30] that little hearse in that horrible
[2:10:33] condition is the first child of that
[2:10:36] mother is the first that broke the
[2:10:38] matrix
[2:10:40] so because he's the first he's born
[2:10:43] under the law of the birthright that
[2:10:46] require him to be redeemed
[2:10:54] amen oh praise the lord
[2:10:58] amen
[2:11:00] hallelujah
[2:11:02] glory be to god
[2:11:04] amen you appreciate this when you when
[2:11:06] you find your place
[2:11:08] amen you appreciate it when you when you
[2:11:10] realize
[2:11:12] i don't know what position the new birth
[2:11:14] is
[2:11:16] amen
[2:11:19] when you understand
[2:11:22] why
[2:11:23] the holy ghost is important
[2:11:28] the priest will never see you the man of
[2:11:30] the house when he come out in the
[2:11:32] morning and see you were born on a
[2:11:35] breath right
[2:11:36] you are the first one
[2:11:39] you have a birthright
[2:11:42] so the master
[2:11:46] will have to go and get a lamb
[2:11:50] that will have to be examined
[2:11:53] don't worry boy
[2:11:55] the priest is not going to see you
[2:11:57] the master of the house will have to go
[2:12:00] and get a lamb
[2:12:02] that will be a zombie
[2:12:04] and that lamb has to be
[2:12:06] more prettier than you
[2:12:09] no blemish
[2:12:10] not a crippled lamb
[2:12:12] nor cross eyed
[2:12:17] that's right
[2:12:19] oh praise the lord
[2:12:21] oh thank you jesus
[2:12:25] who has wanted to take the book and to
[2:12:28] lose the sills thereof
[2:12:30] john went because no man was walter
[2:12:34] every man no matter how he was born
[2:12:36] either his hair was crooked or his eyes
[2:12:38] or his nose every man came with a
[2:12:41] crooked spot
[2:12:42] in his life
[2:12:48] but don't worry
[2:12:49] because the worshiper is never on an
[2:12:52] examination
[2:12:54] the worshiper is never on an examination
[2:13:11] praise the lord
[2:13:12] so if you are still dealing with complex
[2:13:16] you better go and find your lamb
[2:13:20] praise the lord
[2:13:22] if you are still dealing with complex
[2:13:23] comparing yourself to people
[2:13:27] want to look like this person and want
[2:13:28] to look like this person is because you
[2:13:30] you have not found a lamb yet
[2:13:33] to represent you you don't know your
[2:13:35] place in the birth line
[2:13:42] but a man or a woman that know their
[2:13:44] place in the birth line
[2:13:46] they have experienced a new birth
[2:13:48] and knows that the holy ghost make them
[2:13:51] accepted in their beloved
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:55] does not go with complex
[2:13:59] you can say what you want to say
[2:14:02] but i know that i'm accepted in the
[2:14:04] beloved and that's what matters
[2:14:09] you can continue with your gossiping
[2:14:14] maybe that's what you are good for
[2:14:22] if your own mother is rightly instructed
[2:14:26] she would say you were born under the
[2:14:28] birthright
[2:14:29] you are the first you have a birthright
[2:14:32] so the master will go and get a lamb
[2:14:36] and we have it to be a zombie by the
[2:14:38] priest without blemish
[2:14:41] yes
[2:14:42] and he will have to die in your place
[2:14:45] praise the lord
[2:14:47] oh my see that little crooked
[2:14:50] donkey chunkiness
[2:14:54] the lord
[2:14:58] amen
[2:15:00] hallelujah
[2:15:02] hey man
[2:15:03] well i really thought some people
[2:15:04] dealing with complex will bust out of
[2:15:06] their seat
[2:15:07] jump out and praise god
[2:15:09] because you have never been on an
[2:15:10] examination
[2:15:13] he hath made you accepted in the beloved
[2:15:16] praise the lord
[2:15:18] hallelujah
[2:15:20] amen
[2:15:22] he would get along with our blemish and
[2:15:24] he will have to die in your place so you
[2:15:27] can live
[2:15:29] and the little fellow
[2:15:31] mind he will kick up his knock knees
[2:15:35] and run and have a big time
[2:15:38] praise the lord he's never going to see
[2:15:41] him the priest isn't going to see him
[2:15:43] the priest is going to examine the lamb
[2:15:51] now that's what paul i mean uh uh uh the
[2:15:54] scripture was dealing with here we were
[2:15:56] just reading in in exodus chapter 13.
[2:15:59] let's get back to our scripture here
[2:16:04] because we have a little more to cover
[2:16:09] amen
[2:16:15] verse 13 in every first line of anas
[2:16:19] thou shalt redeem with elam
[2:16:22] and if
[2:16:23] and if thou will not redeem it
[2:16:27] then thou shalt break his neck
[2:16:30] and all
[2:16:32] the firstborn of man among the children
[2:16:37] shall doubt redeem
[2:16:40] now so this also established a principle
[2:16:44] here that there are some first link that
[2:16:46] will be redeemed and there are some
[2:16:48] first lane if you don't want to redeem
[2:16:50] it you just break the neck
[2:16:54] praise the lord
[2:16:56] amen
[2:16:57] you just break the neck because it will
[2:17:00] prove to you
[2:17:01] over in uh
[2:17:03] help me now genesis chapter 38 let's go
[2:17:06] back to genesis chapter 38
[2:17:09] praise the lord
[2:17:11] genesis chapter 38
[2:17:14] amen let's read verse 7.
[2:17:20] i think the people back there can get it
[2:17:22] to it
[2:17:22] faster than me
[2:17:26] tell it verse seven the bible says and
[2:17:29] earth judah firstborn
[2:17:32] was wicked
[2:17:35] in the sight of the lord and the lord
[2:17:38] slew
[2:17:39] him
[2:17:42] so now because you are the firstborn you
[2:17:45] have the right to leave
[2:17:50] so god is saying the first born of an
[2:17:52] ass
[2:17:54] if if you don't want it if it's too ugly
[2:17:57] for you to bear it then just break the
[2:17:59] neck
[2:18:00] because almighty god will do the same
[2:18:02] here
[2:18:05] he was the firstborn of judah
[2:18:07] but he was wicked
[2:18:12] [Music]
[2:18:13] i mean for him to for him for god to
[2:18:17] just just kill him
[2:18:20] without giving us a reason shows that
[2:18:23] he have such weakness in his heart
[2:18:34] and there are people like that
[2:18:39] never want good for another person
[2:18:44] and all the good for themselves they can
[2:18:46] never
[2:18:47] appreciate never be satisfied
[2:18:52] wickedness
[2:18:53] is just in the car of their blood
[2:18:57] that's right
[2:18:58] he was a firstborn
[2:19:01] but god broke his neck
[2:19:11] praise the lord
[2:19:17] leviticus chapter 27
[2:19:19] verse 26
[2:19:20] [Music]
[2:19:23] leviticus 27 26.
[2:19:35] praise the lord
[2:19:37] are we together
[2:19:42] only in the first lane
[2:19:44] of
[2:19:45] the beast's
[2:19:46] wish should be
[2:19:49] the law's first name
[2:19:51] no man
[2:19:55] no man shall sanctify it whether
[2:20:02] ebox or sheep
[2:20:04] it is the laws
[2:20:09] numbers 18.
[2:20:17] now one of the things that you can you
[2:20:18] can also appreciate in this is that you
[2:20:22] see how god is taking this subject in a
[2:20:25] progressive way
[2:20:28] praise the lord
[2:20:29] he's taking the subject in a progressive
[2:20:32] way
[2:20:34] why because it's his internal thoughts
[2:20:38] [Music]
[2:20:41] so he keep saying the same thing but
[2:20:44] every time he says it he brings more
[2:20:46] information
[2:20:49] every time he goes back to the same
[2:20:51] subject he brings more information
[2:20:55] numbers chapter 18
[2:20:57] verse 14.
[2:21:14] everything devoted in israel shall be
[2:21:18] down
[2:21:19] everything
[2:21:20] that openeth the matrix
[2:21:23] of all flesh
[2:21:25] which
[2:21:27] they bring unto the lord whether it be
[2:21:30] man or beast
[2:21:32] shah
[2:21:35] shall be down nevertheless the firstborn
[2:21:39] of man
[2:21:41] shall they are surely redeemed
[2:21:44] and the first lane
[2:21:47] of unclean beasts shall they are
[2:21:49] redeemed
[2:21:50] praise the lord
[2:21:52] amen
[2:22:02] now but let's go back let's go back
[2:22:04] again a little bit here to number three
[2:22:08] that's that's where i wanted to get a uh
[2:22:11] okay
[2:22:12] i know why i read that because i had it
[2:22:14] in a sequence of showing the progression
[2:22:18] in every
[2:22:19] but i think i'm i'm losing time here
[2:22:29] number three
[2:22:33] numbers three twelve
[2:22:36] numbers 3 12
[2:22:38] which shows right here
[2:22:40] 11 and the law speaks unto moses saying
[2:22:44] and i behold i have taken the levite
[2:22:47] from among the children of israel
[2:22:50] carried the baby in the cry room now
[2:22:54] oh as you want every one of us to play
[2:22:55] with her
[2:23:01] i have taken the levite from among the
[2:23:03] children of israel instead of the first
[2:23:06] born that opened it
[2:23:08] the matrix among the children of israel
[2:23:10] therefore the levites shall be mine
[2:23:14] praise the lord
[2:23:16] now god year
[2:23:19] first it was the first born
[2:23:23] there in in in exodus chapter chapter 13
[2:23:26] we did not read everything but
[2:23:28] we all know the story because he said
[2:23:31] establish this among the people and
[2:23:33] remind them that because i saved the
[2:23:35] first born in egypt that's the reason
[2:23:37] why are requiring all the first born
[2:23:40] so now
[2:23:42] uh he's requiring the first bond of man
[2:23:45] in the first born of beast but as as it
[2:23:48] progressed we see that now god is going
[2:23:51] to take
[2:23:52] a people
[2:23:54] he's going to take a people
[2:23:58] yes praise the lord
[2:24:00] so
[2:24:01] look at the progression even in creation
[2:24:05] let there be light
[2:24:07] let there be
[2:24:08] water divide from the land let there be
[2:24:10] fishes let it be animal but when it came
[2:24:12] to the end he created a man in his image
[2:24:19] so you see the progression every time
[2:24:22] god progressed in his word when he gave
[2:24:25] he gave a statue or a command
[2:24:30] it's pointing to men
[2:24:36] praise the lord
[2:24:38] when he gave the sabbath as a rest
[2:24:42] as a statue that people observe it but
[2:24:45] jesus come and say come unto me all you
[2:24:48] the labor and heavy lady and i will give
[2:24:51] you rest
[2:24:57] praise the lord
[2:24:59] so god
[2:25:01] interests
[2:25:03] in in the person god interest in a man
[2:25:06] is more than the heart that he will or
[2:25:09] the belt that he wear or the shoes that
[2:25:10] is on his feet
[2:25:14] his interest in you as a being
[2:25:22] it's more than you working at four
[2:25:24] o'clock in the morning or three o'clock
[2:25:26] or seven o'clock or i mean you
[2:25:28] whatever you do
[2:25:31] his interest
[2:25:32] his focus is to the man
[2:25:34] it's to the being
[2:25:38] then more than your arts and your days
[2:25:47] are we together
[2:25:48] so he progressed here with the thought
[2:25:50] let's go to verse 40
[2:25:53] of the scene chapter 3.
[2:25:55] he goes along
[2:25:58] and now he's saying and and the lord
[2:26:00] said unto moses normal all the firstborn
[2:26:03] of nailed of the children
[2:26:05] of israel from
[2:26:08] from a month old and up wall and take
[2:26:11] the numbers
[2:26:13] of their names
[2:26:15] and thou shalt take the levites
[2:26:20] for me i am the lord
[2:26:22] instead of the first born
[2:26:25] now so god was dealing with firstborn
[2:26:27] now he's taking the levite and as you
[2:26:30] read down the scripture he's going to
[2:26:32] say all the first born of katos now must
[2:26:35] be redeemed by money and giving to the
[2:26:38] levite
[2:26:44] so you see the progression of thought
[2:26:47] yes amen
[2:26:49] the progression of thought
[2:27:01] the katos
[2:27:02] of the levites instead of the first lane
[2:27:05] among the cattles of the turin of israel
[2:27:07] and moses number
[2:27:09] as the lord commanded him all the first
[2:27:11] born among the turin of israel you go
[2:27:12] back in this and just read on that you
[2:27:15] see you see how the progression of the
[2:27:18] thought is
[2:27:20] you know the progression of the thought
[2:27:22] agent and and and all of this is right
[2:27:25] on the uh the tournament chapter 15
[2:27:28] verse 19 you also read about the first
[2:27:30] thing and uh kind of for losing time
[2:27:33] here so uh
[2:27:35] uh
[2:27:37] let's uh
[2:27:38] let's just travel
[2:27:41] praise the lord
[2:27:44] amen
[2:27:47] amen
[2:27:49] now another thing there is that uh
[2:27:51] uh
[2:27:55] you also learn to appreciate
[2:28:02] how
[2:28:03] the children of israel
[2:28:05] how they had this ordinance
[2:28:07] even though they were used in shadow
[2:28:11] but yet
[2:28:12] it was so important to them
[2:28:16] so much important to them
[2:28:19] let's let's look at the scripture here
[2:28:22] and
[2:28:24] genesis chapter 43
[2:28:28] genesis chapter 43
[2:28:34] genesis chapter 43
[2:28:44] verse 33
[2:28:46] genesis 43
[2:28:49] verse 33
[2:28:55] 32 and and they sat
[2:29:01] and it set on him
[2:29:03] and and it set on for him
[2:29:07] by himself and for them by themselves
[2:29:10] and for the egyptians which did eat with
[2:29:13] him by themselves because the egyptian
[2:29:17] might not eat bread with the hebrew
[2:29:20] hebrews
[2:29:21] for that is an abomination onto the
[2:29:23] egyptians
[2:29:25] now what i want you to see is this
[2:29:28] and they sat before him
[2:29:31] the first bone i called into his
[2:29:33] birthright
[2:29:35] and the youngest
[2:29:37] are calling to his youth
[2:29:40] and the man marvel
[2:29:43] one
[2:29:44] at another
[2:29:46] what is this
[2:29:47] when when when the sons
[2:29:50] of jacob
[2:29:52] came into the hall to sit down
[2:29:55] they mother because
[2:29:56] they don't have this order they don't
[2:29:58] have this discipline
[2:30:00] the mother at the discipline
[2:30:03] because when the sons of jacob will sit
[2:30:06] down they sat down by their breath right
[2:30:10] now the youngest running to get seat
[2:30:12] because you want to be in the first road
[2:30:18] but the youngest stood up reuben had his
[2:30:21] seat and the first one next to reuben
[2:30:23] have his seat and the next one took his
[2:30:26] seat you can see how the birthright
[2:30:28] explicitly
[2:30:31] the birthright have to do with placing
[2:30:33] in position
[2:30:35] they honest to it
[2:30:38] they respected it it was part of their
[2:30:40] lives
[2:30:41] yes
[2:30:44] in a in a generation an age where curtis
[2:30:48] said it's gone
[2:30:49] this generation don't know courtesy
[2:30:54] they don't know please they don't know
[2:30:55] excuse me they don't know thank you no
[2:30:57] courtesy
[2:31:02] the bible says the egyptians saw it and
[2:31:04] the mother wow
[2:31:08] they did not call their ages
[2:31:10] they did not say i am the firstborn but
[2:31:12] in the way that they stood up and one
[2:31:14] took his position and then the next one
[2:31:16] came around and took his position and
[2:31:19] the next one came around and took his
[2:31:20] position
[2:31:22] the egyptian's mouth was hanging wow
[2:31:28] wow
[2:31:31] even though they could not associate
[2:31:33] with these hebrews because they were
[2:31:35] abomination but yet they saw something
[2:31:38] that they didn't had
[2:31:44] because for the egyptian ace who you
[2:31:46] know what you know
[2:31:51] they bring all the directors in first
[2:31:54] they bring all the manager in first
[2:32:01] but these sons of hebrew they were
[2:32:03] displaying
[2:32:05] an order
[2:32:09] a divine other
[2:32:11] something was driving driving them
[2:32:14] in a way
[2:32:16] where they were displaying
[2:32:18] what was in god's mind
[2:32:23] the birthright speaks of position it
[2:32:25] speaks of authority
[2:32:30] are we together
[2:32:36] what an asian day that we are living in
[2:32:41] the birthright it speaks of authority
[2:32:48] and it gives a man a
[2:32:52] been superior over the rest of the
[2:32:54] family
[2:32:55] another thing that was in the birthright
[2:32:57] is that it holds
[2:32:59] a double portion of the parental
[2:33:02] inheritance
[2:33:05] so if we will have any inheritance from
[2:33:07] the father it must come through the
[2:33:08] birthright
[2:33:11] there was
[2:33:12] there was uh
[2:33:15] uh a peculiar benediction the blessings
[2:33:18] of the father and another thing that was
[2:33:21] in the birthright
[2:33:22] it was the priesthood
[2:33:26] the priesthood was in the birthright
[2:33:28] previous
[2:33:31] to its establishment in the in in the in
[2:33:34] the leviticus family or in the peri in
[2:33:37] the uh aaronic priesthood so the
[2:33:40] birthright
[2:33:41] that person
[2:33:44] that was the firstborn
[2:33:46] was the one that
[2:33:48] said the blessing let's say that way
[2:33:50] you know he was he was almost like the
[2:33:53] priest of the family even before the
[2:33:55] priesthood it was established by nature
[2:33:58] it was there so that's the reason why it
[2:34:00] you know it
[2:34:02] inspired our heart to see
[2:34:04] what made king desire or or abel desire
[2:34:08] to be a shepherd boy
[2:34:10] that's the reason why his sacrifice was
[2:34:13] accepted
[2:34:16] because he was the priest
[2:34:21] praise the lord
[2:34:24] and let jacob here with all of uh uh
[2:34:28] uh uh his supplanting attitude but he's
[2:34:32] driving in the path of being
[2:34:36] dweller intense a plain man a shepherd
[2:34:38] man
[2:34:43] because it was from his own flock that
[2:34:44] he killed a sheep for rebecca to dress
[2:34:47] him up
[2:34:50] [Music]
[2:34:53] are we together
[2:34:56] until the establishment of the aaronic
[2:34:59] priesthood
[2:35:00] the firstborn
[2:35:02] was the head of the family exercising
[2:35:04] priestly right
[2:35:07] praise the lord
[2:35:09] amen
[2:35:11] and the firstborn also
[2:35:13] he had
[2:35:14] the edenic promise
[2:35:17] of the second bruiser
[2:35:20] genesis 3 the seed of the woman will
[2:35:23] bruise the head of the serpent but do
[2:35:26] you realize that when god tore abraham
[2:35:29] of his seed what did he said your seed
[2:35:33] will possess the gates
[2:35:35] so the possession of the gate is linked
[2:35:38] to the promise of bruising the serpent
[2:35:40] head
[2:35:44] praise the lord
[2:35:54] so that's the reason why you can find
[2:35:56] that uh uh uh that that blessing was
[2:35:59] said to isaac your seed shall possess
[2:36:02] the get when you go down there to
[2:36:04] rebecca when her parents were blessing
[2:36:05] her the same thing was here over her
[2:36:07] your seat shall possess the gifts why
[2:36:09] because it's a promise that is tied to
[2:36:13] the seed of the woman
[2:36:21] we talking about the birthright
[2:36:23] let me speed up here
[2:36:25] i need to close this down
[2:36:28] praise the lord
[2:36:30] amen
[2:36:36] now as we look at this
[2:36:39] you will see that
[2:36:42] there's a pattern in scripture
[2:36:46] there's a pattern in scripture
[2:36:52] it you know it gets to the place
[2:36:55] of where when you look at it closely
[2:36:58] you will see that there there was a
[2:37:00] divine
[2:37:01] a divine driving force and an
[2:37:04] inspiration that was driving the the the
[2:37:08] patriots it was driving the man of all
[2:37:10] into this position
[2:37:14] and it all it always it looks like
[2:37:18] this thing was bypassing the natural
[2:37:21] first bone
[2:37:23] because naturally
[2:37:25] king was the firstborn of eve
[2:37:29] he opened the matrix
[2:37:31] praise the lord
[2:37:33] but we know that the birthright was
[2:37:36] given to seth
[2:37:38] that took the place of israel
[2:37:42] amen
[2:37:44] the firstborn of noah
[2:37:48] was uh jeff
[2:37:52] but the blessing was given to shame
[2:38:00] naturally the firstborn
[2:38:03] of abraham was ishmael
[2:38:07] praise the lord
[2:38:11] but isaac was the son of promise
[2:38:21] isa in this story was the firstborn but
[2:38:24] we know jacob got the birthright
[2:38:27] judah
[2:38:29] or
[2:38:30] rubin
[2:38:31] was the firstborn of jacob
[2:38:34] but the blessing was given to joseph
[2:38:38] aaron was the firstborn
[2:38:43] of amram and jacob
[2:38:46] but moses
[2:38:48] was giving the birthright
[2:38:50] moses was put in position
[2:38:55] he was put in position
[2:38:59] david was the youngest of all his
[2:39:01] brothers
[2:39:04] but he was the one that was brought in
[2:39:06] position
[2:39:10] are we together
[2:39:13] now so when you look at this and and you
[2:39:16] look at it and and in the line of
[2:39:19] scripture you realize
[2:39:21] that
[2:39:22] it is not just a natural thing
[2:39:25] because
[2:39:27] uh uh uh even though the law designed it
[2:39:31] that way that the first one that opened
[2:39:33] the matrix but you also see that there
[2:39:36] is a supernatural effect in it
[2:39:41] in a sense that
[2:39:44] or some you know the thing that well
[2:39:46] yeah you know you know i'm the first
[2:39:48] born and and and the brains they showed
[2:39:50] up for that but you realize that
[2:39:54] god in his infinite wisdom
[2:39:57] praise the lord
[2:39:59] amen
[2:40:00] in his infinite wisdom as well as we
[2:40:03] just as we look at this let me run
[2:40:06] through these things quickly so close
[2:40:08] this bible now
[2:40:10] amen
[2:40:13] so we can be able to to see some of
[2:40:15] these so but we we see here the
[2:40:17] progression
[2:40:19] we see the progression and where god
[2:40:21] progressed to was to have the levites
[2:40:26] in the place of the first bone first
[2:40:28] born of man first born of beast
[2:40:30] everything now is honor the levite
[2:40:35] are we together
[2:40:37] so it shows that god
[2:40:40] in his mind is now
[2:40:42] choosing a people for his namesake
[2:40:46] it shows god's choosing people it shows
[2:40:49] that he has made our priests and kings
[2:40:52] unto our god
[2:40:55] are we together
[2:40:56] but then it's also show how god
[2:41:00] has taken the the the the the office of
[2:41:05] the priesthood
[2:41:09] how he have taken the office of the
[2:41:12] priesthood and that is the reason why
[2:41:14] uh
[2:41:16] you know verb says here he says true
[2:41:20] sign that is overlooked he said they
[2:41:22] have got to be right he's talking about
[2:41:24] the minister because they are standing
[2:41:27] here holding the highest office
[2:41:31] that is held in the world
[2:41:34] a minister
[2:41:35] a minister and the most truthful
[2:41:40] and right accurate
[2:41:43] we must be that way
[2:41:46] we must depend on god
[2:41:48] to do it
[2:41:50] in a trip report he says according to
[2:41:52] the bible the highest office
[2:41:55] in the local church
[2:41:56] is the ender
[2:41:58] which is the pastor
[2:42:02] so
[2:42:03] god now is bringing in a ministry
[2:42:09] he's bringing in a people
[2:42:16] that's what brother branham will call
[2:42:18] the five full ministry god dress way
[2:42:23] are we together
[2:42:24] amen let's look at some scriptures here
[2:42:27] quickly
[2:42:28] again romans chapter 8
[2:42:32] one of our famous scriptures here
[2:42:35] that will take us back to our subject of
[2:42:38] full knowledge
[2:42:43] romans chapter 8
[2:42:45] let's read from verse 29
[2:42:48] romans 8 29
[2:42:53] praise the lord
[2:42:56] romans 8 29 for whom he did for known
[2:43:02] he also did predestinate
[2:43:05] to be conformed to the image of his son
[2:43:10] and we said that this image is not like
[2:43:14] you build an image here or you have the
[2:43:16] person and then you print a picture of
[2:43:18] them or you make a mult plate of them
[2:43:21] no
[2:43:23] this image is an expression
[2:43:25] jesus christ being the image of god is
[2:43:28] that he expressed god
[2:43:30] it's not like he looked like god no he
[2:43:33] expressed god
[2:43:38] praise the lord
[2:43:39] so we see here that
[2:43:42] those that he foreknew that was in his
[2:43:45] mind that he predestinated they were to
[2:43:48] be confirmed
[2:43:50] they were to be transformed to express
[2:43:53] christ in their day
[2:43:56] amen they were supposed to transform
[2:43:59] their lives for them to express jesus
[2:44:02] christ in their day they're supposed to
[2:44:04] be written episode read of all me
[2:44:12] not only saying i believe the message
[2:44:15] no you must be an expression of god
[2:44:18] conformed to the image
[2:44:20] of his son that he might be the
[2:44:22] firstborn
[2:44:25] among
[2:44:26] many brethrens
[2:44:29] yes
[2:44:30] [Music]
[2:44:33] praise the lord amen
[2:44:40] collusion chapter 1 verse 15.
[2:44:48] praise the lord
[2:44:51] are we together
[2:45:03] jesus
[2:45:05] took the story of the prodigal son
[2:45:08] and what he was dealing with there he
[2:45:10] was also dealing with breath right
[2:45:12] he was dealing with inheritance
[2:45:15] he took the story of the prodigal son
[2:45:19] and he
[2:45:21] he decided to ask
[2:45:23] the the the pharisees
[2:45:26] you know and and deal with them a little
[2:45:28] bit okay we have the scripture up there
[2:45:29] i'm spending my bible here talking at
[2:45:30] the same time losing my thoughts
[2:45:33] uh verse 15 the bible says
[2:45:36] who is the image of the invisible god
[2:45:41] the firstborn of every creature
[2:45:45] jesus is the firstborn of every creature
[2:45:50] that is the reason why the scripture
[2:45:52] says by him all things consist
[2:45:57] because he is the firstborn
[2:46:01] so in him
[2:46:03] is the breath right
[2:46:06] without him nothing was made
[2:46:10] that is made
[2:46:12] so you see how we come into position
[2:46:17] how we come
[2:46:19] to our rights
[2:46:22] and benefit
[2:46:24] is being in him
[2:46:26] by one spirit we are all baptized
[2:46:30] into one body
[2:46:35] that's the reason why we can enjoy this
[2:46:37] benefit
[2:46:40] people that are now baptized into the
[2:46:42] body by the holy ghost they can look at
[2:46:44] you and think that you are crazy
[2:46:47] they think that you too much on the
[2:46:48] extreme
[2:46:50] praise the lord but we can enjoy this
[2:46:52] benefit because what he is our firstborn
[2:46:57] amen
[2:46:58] amen hallelujah
[2:47:01] and you see hebrew he brings us in
[2:47:05] to be what co equal with him
[2:47:07] [Music]
[2:47:08] he's not ruling us like other first born
[2:47:11] would do and tell us
[2:47:12] i'm your firstborn so everything belongs
[2:47:14] to me no
[2:47:17] since you are called equal with me
[2:47:21] are we together
[2:47:23] let's look at verse 18 of that same
[2:47:26] chapter
[2:47:29] amen
[2:47:33] verse 18
[2:47:34] and he is the head of the body
[2:47:39] the church
[2:47:41] who is the beginning
[2:47:44] the firstborn from the dead yes praise
[2:47:48] the lord
[2:47:49] oh that's the reason why the
[2:47:51] resurrection is the hope of the church
[2:47:55] the resurrection is the thing that draws
[2:47:57] us every day
[2:47:59] because he came from the grave we will
[2:48:02] rise again we will rise above any
[2:48:05] situation
[2:48:07] hallelujah
[2:48:10] because he is the firstborn from the
[2:48:12] dead
[2:48:16] and he broke the holes of death from
[2:48:18] over his people
[2:48:20] praise the lord
[2:48:25] amen
[2:48:28] he's the head of the church
[2:48:33] hebrew chapter 12
[2:48:38] verse 23.
[2:48:49] have the musicians come up soon here
[2:48:58] now there there are things i want to go
[2:49:00] into here
[2:49:04] i don't i don't think i've gone pretty
[2:49:06] much through half of my
[2:49:08] my notes here but that's okay
[2:49:11] that's okay let's just read this
[2:49:14] hebrew chapter 2 verse 23
[2:49:17] to the general assembly
[2:49:19] and the church
[2:49:20] of the firstborn
[2:49:22] which are written
[2:49:24] in heaven
[2:49:28] where in heaven
[2:49:31] in the mind of god
[2:49:39] to the church
[2:49:40] of the first born so you see here he
[2:49:44] brought it
[2:49:45] from a natural family
[2:49:49] told the
[2:49:50] belongings
[2:49:52] the herbs and cuddles their fresh fruits
[2:49:55] from the field
[2:49:56] and then he took it down to a whole trap
[2:49:59] of people
[2:50:01] and now he's bringing it now in a
[2:50:03] spiritual sense
[2:50:06] to a church
[2:50:10] the church of the firstborn
[2:50:16] praise the lord
[2:50:18] that's why he says i'll be in my church
[2:50:20] and the gifts of hell will now prevail
[2:50:22] against it
[2:50:23] because this is the church of the
[2:50:25] firstborn
[2:50:26] a church that is birthed by the word of
[2:50:29] god not by the crease of men
[2:50:36] john said these are the children of god
[2:50:38] that are not born of flesh or blood but
[2:50:41] they are born of the seed incorruptible
[2:50:44] which is the word of god amen
[2:50:49] are we together
[2:50:51] verb says here question and answer
[2:50:55] now what is the birthright is that right
[2:50:57] he says
[2:50:59] that's what i'm trying to tell you this
[2:51:02] holy ghost is your birthright
[2:51:04] that's your birthright
[2:51:08] that's your god-given right
[2:51:12] he says now people will say today i will
[2:51:15] go to church i'm just as good as the
[2:51:18] next fellow but me
[2:51:20] they will add like one of them holy
[2:51:23] brothers
[2:51:24] not me
[2:51:25] you know i i mean they're they're
[2:51:27] getting the i mean they just want church
[2:51:29] association
[2:51:30] they never want to come to the place of
[2:51:32] breath never want to come to the place
[2:51:34] or fall surrounding to god
[2:51:40] they have their own idea of what they
[2:51:42] think god is and they think god must
[2:51:44] come down to their to their ideals
[2:51:50] praise the lord
[2:51:51] but without the new birth and without
[2:51:53] the holy ghost you don't have the
[2:51:56] birthright
[2:51:57] you can claim all your rights as
[2:51:59] whatever you want to claim right
[2:52:02] but this breath ride that we are talking
[2:52:03] about
[2:52:05] the one that gave you right to come off
[2:52:07] the grave
[2:52:09] the one that gave you right for your
[2:52:11] body to obey your confession only comes
[2:52:15] by the sea incorruptible
[2:52:20] amen
[2:52:22] are we together
[2:52:35] he talks about
[2:52:37] jacob
[2:52:39] here in receiving rt now we find the
[2:52:41] birthright means everything to jacob and
[2:52:44] now he didn't care
[2:52:45] he didn't care for nothing else
[2:52:48] but that breath right
[2:52:50] he didn't care what it would cost him
[2:52:54] praise the lord you need to find that
[2:52:57] place that's that's what paul said when
[2:52:59] he said make your call and your election
[2:53:01] show
[2:53:02] you need to find that place with god
[2:53:08] you need to find a place where you know
[2:53:10] that you know that you know
[2:53:16] praise the lord
[2:53:22] amen i mean that place of god word i
[2:53:26] mean a person is birthed to the place
[2:53:28] when you realize that i mean you you
[2:53:31] cannot live without him there is not a
[2:53:32] meaning or second of your life
[2:53:36] without god
[2:53:39] praise the lord
[2:53:42] i mean we can find all the reason
[2:53:44] josephine take that baby in the cry room
[2:53:46] that's what we have cry room for
[2:53:57] i mean people would give all reasons
[2:54:04] and man
[2:54:06] that knows this
[2:54:08] your breath right your inheritance is
[2:54:10] lying in this bible
[2:54:13] amen
[2:54:14] praise the lord
[2:54:21] you find christians that have never been
[2:54:23] able to read through their bible
[2:54:26] all of their years of being christian
[2:54:27] they have never been able to read
[2:54:30] through this book
[2:54:34] only pick and choose just like growing
[2:54:36] to the to the candy store
[2:54:40] pick a few verses and read that how to
[2:54:42] do their religion
[2:54:44] when this book all your
[2:54:47] all inheritance
[2:54:47] deliverance
[2:54:49] and you have no desire to search the
[2:54:52] scripture
[2:54:55] never been able to read through the
[2:54:57] bible all of your years of christianity
[2:55:02] they say well i try you know i start and
[2:55:05] something happen
[2:55:06] you better find out what is happening
[2:55:12] you better find out what is happening
[2:55:16] there are some they cannot even find
[2:55:19] they cannot even count as straight other
[2:55:21] schedule being in the presence of god
[2:55:26] this
[2:55:27] spirit of randomness
[2:55:32] god is a god of order
[2:55:35] he's not a random god
[2:55:56] oh jacob won was the birthright
[2:56:00] something was driving him
[2:56:02] praise the lord
[2:56:04] you know why israel went into captivity
[2:56:07] for 70 years
[2:56:09] it was because the despise the sabbath
[2:56:12] of the lord
[2:56:14] when god told them to allow the land to
[2:56:17] rest
[2:56:18] give the land a sabbath
[2:56:21] they were breaking the commandment of
[2:56:22] god so they were not getting the harvest
[2:56:25] that these two have got every year
[2:56:27] for that reason why they started tilling
[2:56:29] the land every year even the seven years
[2:56:31] they never gave they never honored the
[2:56:34] sabbath
[2:56:45] praise the lord
[2:56:54] that's where our protection is
[2:56:57] it's in the birthright
[2:57:03] glory be to god
[2:57:09] and the new testament church
[2:57:11] can claim the holy ghost
[2:57:12] as a sabbath
[2:57:14] and yet that holy ghost can take the
[2:57:16] desire away from your heart of being in
[2:57:18] the house of god
[2:57:20] because you have the holy ghost
[2:57:23] you have a you have a god you can put in
[2:57:25] your pocket take it out like a cell
[2:57:27] phone
[2:57:33] the bible says as we see the day
[2:57:35] approaching
[2:57:36] yes
[2:57:37] as we see the day approaching and we see
[2:57:40] the things that are happening
[2:57:43] even if you don't have the time but the
[2:57:45] desire don't lost the desire the crave i
[2:57:48] want to be there lord you know i want to
[2:57:49] be
[2:57:53] amen
[2:58:01] and if you're craved
[2:58:03] to the top
[2:58:05] god will turn the clock around for you
[2:58:11] but some people are not craving
[2:58:14] they are looking for every way to be
[2:58:16] away from the house of god
[2:58:18] every every they are doing everything to
[2:58:21] be away
[2:58:26] and the thing about it there is that
[2:58:29] they don't even have no stable diet
[2:58:32] ask them about their own personal
[2:58:33] devotion
[2:58:44] that's what took israel into captivity
[2:58:47] because they despise
[2:58:49] the sabbath of the lord
[2:58:52] that's what make jacob to lose his
[2:58:54] birthright because he despised
[2:58:56] the breath right
[2:59:02] and despising
[2:59:03] it's just so easy it's just winking your
[2:59:05] shoulder
[2:59:07] it's just winging your shoulder
[2:59:10] let them say whatever they want to say
[2:59:18] praise the lord
[2:59:21] that's how much
[2:59:22] the breath right
[2:59:25] is important
[2:59:28] praise the lord
[2:59:31] you know when brother branham talks
[2:59:32] about
[2:59:33] praying choosing your pastor choosing
[2:59:36] your church why because there's a
[2:59:39] priesthood that's an office
[2:59:42] where god has put
[2:59:44] the right that this church will benefit
[2:59:46] if this church will ever come to be a
[2:59:48] fruitful church
[2:59:49] it will have a man that is dedicated to
[2:59:51] the
[2:59:54] word when the prophet of god said you
[2:59:57] can't live higher than your pastor it
[2:59:58] does not mean your own personal walk
[3:00:00] with god
[3:00:02] it means as a body walk
[3:00:05] that's right
[3:00:07] because he's the man that stands as an
[3:00:08] angel that god deal with for the church
[3:00:10] that's the same way he did through the
[3:00:12] church ages
[3:00:24] praise the lord
[3:00:30] he have promised us
[3:00:33] and his promise is yea in amen
[3:00:36] his promise is truth
[3:00:39] praise the lord
[3:00:41] his promise
[3:00:42] is truth
[3:00:50] even in the day words uh darkness is all
[3:00:53] over the place and doubts is all over
[3:00:55] the place
[3:00:56] god is just looking for the man
[3:00:59] or a woman
[3:01:03] that would dedicate your life to the
[3:01:05] world and he will be the same yesterday
[3:01:08] today and forever
[3:01:14] so our breath right
[3:01:16] is in christ
[3:01:18] and he is in the word
[3:01:21] christ is the word christ in our day is
[3:01:24] the revered word of the hour
[3:01:26] in him
[3:01:28] we move
[3:01:29] and we have our being
[3:01:33] musicians you can come
[3:01:35] in him we move
[3:01:38] and we have
[3:01:40] our being
[3:01:48] we have an ancient day where people you
[3:01:51] take search church for
[3:02:00] association no sense of dedication
[3:02:05] people struggling with things in their
[3:02:07] life that comes through church door and
[3:02:09] go out
[3:02:16] praise the lord
[3:02:19] if jesus christ is the same
[3:02:23] he can heals
[3:02:25] he can deliver
[3:02:27] [Music]
[3:02:30] like i always say you will serve him the
[3:02:32] way you know him
[3:02:34] but he molding
[3:02:36] how you know him
[3:02:39] [Music]
[3:02:43] this message of the hour is the move of
[3:02:45] god
[3:02:46] it's not just an association
[3:02:49] it's the move of god to be able to move
[3:02:51] the people into
[3:02:54] the reality of god
[3:02:56] move the people into a translation
[3:02:59] move the people into a rapture
[3:03:06] [Music]
[3:03:15] if it concern you
[3:03:16] you will do something about it
[3:03:20] [Music]
[3:03:31] you see that in the scripture
[3:03:33] how men were born in the lineage of the
[3:03:35] first born
[3:03:36] but yet it was swapped
[3:03:40] why
[3:03:42] even though divinely we can see that god
[3:03:46] led them that way
[3:03:49] but you also realize there was something
[3:03:53] in the heart of moses
[3:03:56] when he looked through the window
[3:03:58] and look at those hebrews he saw them
[3:04:00] different like the egyptians were
[3:04:01] looking at them there was something in
[3:04:03] his heart
[3:04:05] people it's a hot thing it's a hard
[3:04:07] birth god is dealing with the heart
[3:04:12] and let that young man or let that young
[3:04:14] woman
[3:04:16] start to take interest in the things of
[3:04:18] god
[3:04:18] [Music]
[3:04:19] let that young person start to take
[3:04:21] position with the word because the word
[3:04:23] is the first bond so if you take
[3:04:25] position with the word god brings you in
[3:04:27] that place and he bless you in a way
[3:04:31] [Music]
[3:04:39] praise the lord
[3:04:40] it's the law of god
[3:04:45] it's the lord of god
[3:04:48] [Music]
[3:04:53] the only thing our young people want to
[3:04:55] do everybody want to preach
[3:04:57] ask little sam your brother brother uh
[3:05:01] max son he will tell you his story about
[3:05:03] david and goliath he get a wonderful
[3:05:05] inspiration about david and goliath
[3:05:10] but just just learning to be a son
[3:05:14] learning to have interests
[3:05:18] clean the church clean around the
[3:05:20] building do things
[3:05:22] [Music]
[3:05:28] it's not just showing up in suit
[3:05:32] play music singing special
[3:05:36] but you're taking interest in the father
[3:05:38] things
[3:05:41] you're taking interest you're getting
[3:05:43] yourself
[3:05:44] involved it's a work inside you get
[3:05:47] behind the curtain you take god's word
[3:05:49] you devote yourself to it you get a
[3:05:51] discipline a prayer life a time with god
[3:06:07] it's the attitude
[3:06:08] that the father looks at
[3:06:12] he said this son has more interest
[3:06:16] than this one
[3:06:18] i'm going to bless him
[3:06:20] [Music]
[3:06:36] i could say some things to you
[3:06:38] it might sound so personal
[3:06:40] i'm not too fond of it so
[3:06:45] i'm going to leave it like that
[3:06:47] because it's all about christ
[3:06:49] it's not about an individual
[3:07:02] every day i see
[3:07:07] helping me
[3:07:09] lord to overcome

[3:09:24] firstborn he birthed himself
[3:09:30] the beginning of the creation of god

[3:09:34] when you start taking interest in the in
[3:09:36] the first born which is the word you
[3:09:38] start taking interest that's where you

[3:09:46] god care less about your natural
[3:09:48] birthright your natural position in your
[3:09:50] family he care less about it it's all
[3:09:53] about a spiritual position
[3:10:03] that's what jesus was trying to show
[3:10:06] the pharisees
[3:10:08] about the story about the practical son
[3:10:10] he was trying to show that god is all
[3:10:12] about a spiritual move
[3:10:15] it's not about a natural move
[3:10:17] he says you are the first born you kept
[3:10:19] the law you kept the ordinance
[3:10:22] but you don't know what really grace is
[3:10:25] a covenant of grace is going to birth

[3:10:29] which is the younger son that has gone
[3:10:31] out and and you have done all sorts of
[3:10:33] things

[3:10:43] why should i be eating in the pig pen
[3:10:45] when i have a father that has everything

[3:10:53] go back home and be a son if i can save
[3:10:56] my father
[3:10:58] a desire to save
