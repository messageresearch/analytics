[46:53] tonight just for uh uh our subject we've
[46:57] been speaking on the beginning praise
[47:00] the Lord so we want to talk about the
[47:03] Commandments from the
[47:05] beginning the Commandment from the
[47:07] beginning John said the old commandment
[47:10] is the word which ye have heard from the
[47:14] beginning praise the Lord so we want to
[47:17] look at the Commandment from the
[47:18] beginning that's why we want to we want
[47:20] to uh uh talk about praise the Lord and
[47:25] uh if the
[47:27] Lord give us Grace we we really want to
[47:29] look at this subject of the
[47:32] beginning uh trusting and uh uh
[47:35] believing that uh uh the holy spirit
[47:37] will bring something out of it that will
[47:40] be a blessing praise the Lord amen I
[47:44] hope that you have been blessed so far
[47:47] and uh we pray that uh the Lord will
[47:49] continue to bless us are we together the
[47:53] Commandment from the beginning
[47:56] as most time we when we think about the
[47:58] Commandments our mind goes over to the
[48:01] Ten Commandments Moses is the one that
[48:03] wrote it uh uh sorry the Lord wrote it
[48:06] and gave it to Moses that would be the
[48:09] correct thing to say Amen Moses never
[48:11] wrote The Commandments the Lord wrote it
[48:13] with his finger and gave it to Moses so
[48:17] uh uh Moses is the one that brought us
[48:19] that record of the Ten Commandments but
[48:22] uh we will realize that uh uh
[48:26] uh
[48:28] before uh Moses gave us that
[48:32] record praise the Lord before Moses gave
[48:35] us that record uh uh John here is
[48:41] speaking
[48:42] about the
[48:44] Commandments that was given from the
[48:47] beginning I want for us to look at that
[48:50] tonight that's what I want for us to
[48:52] look at praise the Lord
[49:01] I'm uh I'm I'm I'm a little bit
[49:04] distracted not because of anything you
[49:06] are doing is is myself praise the
[49:09] Lord you are not the one is is just
[49:12] myself are we
[49:15] together
[49:21] amen I will tell you what I'm distracted
[49:24] I'll tell you by not
[49:28] now I want us to look at something over
[49:30] in the Book of
[49:32] Genesis let's go in Genesis chapter
[49:36] 2 let's go in Genesis chapter
[49:39] 2 praise the
[49:41] Lord
[49:46] amen as you never get used to the pullit
[49:50] every time I come back here I'm I'm so
[49:52] nervous to death amen
[49:56] I'm so nervous to
[49:58] death
[50:00] but you have become such a wonderful
[50:03] group of people to preach
[50:05] to it's not because I'm a good preacher
[50:09] it's because you have bear with me
[50:12] amen you have bear with me so Genesis
[50:16] chapter
[50:17] 2 Genesis chapter
[50:22] 2 let's go right into it
[50:26] Genesis chapter 2 let's look at verse 16
[50:30] Genesis chapter 2 verse
[50:36] 16 are we together Genesis chapter 2
[50:41] verse
[50:42] 16 and the Lord God
[50:45] commanded the
[50:48] man and the Lord God
[50:52] commanded the
[50:53] man John 6 said the Commandment from the
[50:59] beginning this was the first
[51:02] commandment that God gave to
[51:06] man this was the first commandment that
[51:09] God gave to Adam to to his son that was
[51:16] on the earth and the Lord
[51:19] God
[51:21] commanded the man
[51:23] saying of every
[51:25] tree of the garden thou May freely eat
[51:30] that's the
[51:32] Commandment of every tree of the garden
[51:35] thou May freely eat verse 17 but of the
[51:41] tree of the of knowledge of the
[51:44] knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall
[51:48] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[51:54] eateth thereof thou shall surely die
[52:00] that was the first
[52:04] commandment that was the Commandment
[52:07] from the
[52:08] beginning praise the Lord
[52:12] amen and the beautiful thing about this
[52:15] is that I think I shared that with you
[52:16] to uh uh before if you look at this
[52:19] commandment and you count the words it
[52:23] might not it I not uh uh Faith uh uh in
[52:28] the in in the French translation but in
[52:31] the in the English translation it kind
[52:32] of for fit out for us because if you
[52:36] count the
[52:37] words of every
[52:39] tree of The Gather that eat if you count
[52:45] the words to uh surely D you are going
[52:51] to have 39
[52:54] words
[52:57] if you count off every tree of the
[53:02] garden thou mayth eat freely if you
[53:07] count every one of them and you get to
[53:11] the end of verse 17 you will have 39
[53:17] words so the first commandment had 39
[53:22] words praise the Lord amen
[53:26] amen now the reason why I'm saying that
[53:29] to you is is is to help you appreciate
[53:37] something brother brandham said the
[53:39] number 40 is the number of Temptation or
[53:45] trial he called it the number of
[53:48] Temptation or the number of
[53:51] trial but the first commandment have 39
[53:54] words counted in the English Bible here
[53:57] right before
[53:59] us you will realize that it was only one
[54:03] word that Satan added to the first
[54:09] commandment to finish 40 words and 40 is
[54:14] the number of
[54:19] Temptation praise the Lord
[54:22] amen where am I going with that
[54:25] and when going into the place word it
[54:27] help us to
[54:30] appreciate when the prophet
[54:33] speaks
[54:37] amen there was only one word that Satan
[54:40] added to the first commandment that
[54:43] broke the entire Eden that broke the
[54:46] entire uh uh uh uh peaceful rain that
[54:50] Adam had in the Garden of Eden When God
[54:53] says Thou shal surely die
[54:55] and he says thou shall not surely die
[54:59] praise the Lord so by adding one word he
[55:03] brought a trial or he brought a
[55:04] temptation to Eve and Eve fell by that
[55:07] Temptation and uh and then the the they
[55:10] lose their place before God at that
[55:13] time but that's the
[55:17] Commandment now it's beautiful it's
[55:21] beautiful why it's beautiful is because
[55:25] you will see to the first Adam God gave
[55:29] one
[55:32] commandment and to the second
[55:35] Adam when when the second Adam Jesus
[55:38] came he took the Ten Commandments of
[55:41] Moses and he put them into
[55:45] two praise the
[55:47] Lord amen I will explain that I explain
[55:51] myself so you understand me let's go to
[55:54] Matthew chapter
[55:56] 22 Matthew chapter
[56:07] 22 Matthew chapter
[56:17] 22 are we
[56:19] together
[56:23] amen
[56:26] Matthew chapter
[56:32] 22 in Matthew chapter 22 let's look at
[56:35] verse
[56:35] 34 Matthew chapter 22 let's look at
[56:39] verse 34 and
[56:41] read few verses of our Lord Jesus here
[56:45] the Bible says uh uh
[56:49] uh but when the when the but when the
[56:54] Pharisees
[56:55] had heard that he have put the sades to
[57:00] silence now he put the sadr sees to
[57:03] silence because right before this Jesus
[57:08] have just proven that there is a
[57:12] resurrection he have just spoken on the
[57:15] resurrection because the F the sades did
[57:17] not believe in Resurrection so Jesus
[57:20] brought h h a uh a story from uh from uh
[57:25] the the the Old Testament which of
[57:27] course you can find that in the life of
[57:30] TMA uh uh uh he talking about a man that
[57:33] married a woman and the first brother
[57:35] died and the second brother he's in the
[57:37] resurrection who uh you know wife they
[57:39] would be that was what the sagy brought
[57:42] to ask Jesus to prove to Jesus that
[57:45] there is nothing like Resurrection so
[57:47] whose wife is she going to be then Jesus
[57:50] answered their question there will be
[57:52] like Angels praise the Lord
[57:56] but when the
[57:58] Pharisees have heard that he put the
[58:01] Sadducees to salent they were gathered
[58:04] together then one of them which was a
[58:08] lawyer meaning the man that studied the
[58:10] word Ste the Lord ask him a question
[58:14] tempting him and saying Master which is
[58:19] the great commandment in the Lord now
[58:22] he's referring to the Ten Commandments
[58:24] that was given to Moses asking Jesus
[58:27] which is the
[58:30] greatest of the Commandment are we
[58:33] together Jesus said unto him thou shall
[58:38] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[58:43] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[58:48] mind this is the first and great
[58:53] commandment and the second is like unto
[58:57] it thou shall
[59:00] love thy neighbor as
[59:03] thyself on these two
[59:06] Commandments hang all the laws and the
[59:10] prophets so Jesus brought the the the
[59:14] the Ten Commandments that was given to
[59:16] Moses and he hang it on two
[59:21] strings praise the Lord amen and
[59:24] actually when you look at the Ten
[59:26] Commandments is hanging on two
[59:29] strings the first portion of the
[59:32] Commandments have to do with your love
[59:34] to God thou oh Israel the Lord our God
[59:37] is one Lord thou shall not worship any
[59:40] other God before me he said jealous God
[59:43] is all about our love to
[59:46] God the rest of the other commandment
[59:50] have to do with your neighbor so Jesus
[59:53] is saying there that if you love your
[59:56] neighbor you will not commit adultery if
[59:59] you love your neighbor you will not CT
[1:00:01] if you love your neighbor you will not
[1:00:03] bear false witness if you love so all
[1:00:05] the rest of the other combin men is just
[1:00:09] love your
[1:00:14] neighbor praise the Lord amen now God
[1:00:19] gave adam one
[1:00:22] commandment why because Adam never had a
[1:00:29] neighbor
[1:00:31] amen he never had a neighbor he never
[1:00:34] had to deal with anybody all he had to
[1:00:37] do is stay behind that
[1:00:40] word and he are going to have constant
[1:00:44] fellowship with men brother brandham
[1:00:48] said when Adam fell then God introduced
[1:00:51] a second Covenant and on that second
[1:00:55] Covenant comes the provision of the
[1:00:58] second
[1:01:03] commandment are we together so now we
[1:01:07] have to deal with God and I have to deal
[1:01:10] with you as my
[1:01:12] neighbors praise the
[1:01:14] Lord I have to deal with God I have to
[1:01:16] walk upright before God and I also have
[1:01:19] to walk upright before
[1:01:22] you one do not go without the
[1:01:28] other praise the Lord are we
[1:01:34] together amen one do not go without the
[1:01:41] other so the first Adam had only one
[1:01:45] commandment
[1:01:47] because his Fellowship was only with
[1:01:52] God we have two Commandments because our
[1:01:56] fellowship is with the father and also
[1:01:59] with the
[1:02:03] Brethren are we together now what is the
[1:02:07] Commandment because here John is telling
[1:02:09] us that the Commandment of all the
[1:02:14] Commandment from the beginning he said
[1:02:17] it was the
[1:02:18] word when we think about the Commandment
[1:02:22] we think about do and don't do this
[1:02:26] don't do this do this don't do this
[1:02:28] that's all we think in our
[1:02:31] mind praise the Lord
[1:02:37] amen that's that's the way we that's the
[1:02:40] way we perceive the
[1:02:44] Commandment that God don't want us to
[1:02:46] worship no no no other graving IM he
[1:02:48] don't want us to have no other God you
[1:02:51] know and and that thing has been brought
[1:02:53] down to the the church that the instead
[1:02:56] of the people falling in love with God
[1:03:00] all they want to do they just want to
[1:03:02] know what is the law of the church what
[1:03:04] is the rule of this church what do this
[1:03:07] church believe what can I do to be a
[1:03:09] faithful member you're just looking for
[1:03:13] rules that's all religion give men is
[1:03:16] rules don't do this don't do that don't
[1:03:19] do this but that was not the intention
[1:03:22] of The
[1:03:23] Commandments
[1:03:26] that was not the intention of the
[1:03:28] Commandment because when God gave adam
[1:03:32] this word God gave it to Adam to be his
[1:03:38] protection praise the
[1:03:41] Lord he gave adam his word to be his
[1:03:48] protection the word from the
[1:03:52] beginning Hallelujah
[1:03:54] yeah are we
[1:03:59] together glory be to
[1:04:04] God brother bam shared in the message
[1:04:08] conflict between God and
[1:04:17] Satan God are the
[1:04:21] beginning praise the Lord amen
[1:04:25] God at the beginning gave his
[1:04:28] children their atomic
[1:04:31] weapon praise the
[1:04:34] Lord God at the beginning gave his
[1:04:37] children their atomic weapon
[1:04:39] Hallelujah because he is the infinite
[1:04:44] God see it now seeing there was going to
[1:04:49] be a
[1:04:51] conflict and there was going to be a
[1:04:54] battle God equipped his children with
[1:04:59] the right kind of
[1:05:02] ammunition amen the right kind of attack
[1:05:05] the right kind of
[1:05:08] everything that they had need of thou
[1:05:13] who sweep them all the way from Eden to
[1:05:17] the
[1:05:18] Rapture so when God gave the word in the
[1:05:22] beginning every a he gives the word
[1:05:26] every age the word is our protection
[1:05:29] every age the word is given to fortified
[1:05:32] us when God gave the word he was
[1:05:35] thinking about from Eden all the way to
[1:05:38] the
[1:05:43] Rapture praise the
[1:05:47] Lord glory be to
[1:05:50] God because you were realize over in
[1:05:53] exodor when God brought Israel out he
[1:05:56] never gave them a
[1:05:58] commandment no he never gave them a
[1:06:01] commandment read Exodus chapter 19 you
[1:06:04] will realize that the Lord told Israel
[1:06:06] if you will love the Lord God with all
[1:06:08] of your heart I will make you a kingdom
[1:06:11] of priests you're going to be my people
[1:06:14] and the people misunderstood God because
[1:06:17] the minds of men the way we think
[1:06:20] whenever we hear the word of God what
[1:06:22] comes to our mind is
[1:06:24] do and
[1:06:28] done that's all we think
[1:06:31] about praise the Lord so in the first
[1:06:35] place we don't even appreciate the
[1:06:38] word we are standing around okay what
[1:06:41] should I do what should I don't do
[1:06:45] that's that's the thing that is
[1:06:46] troubling our
[1:06:48] mind because we are always striving to
[1:06:51] do
[1:06:53] something and we think that's the way we
[1:06:55] can gain God
[1:06:57] favor when God spoke to Israel in in
[1:07:00] Exodus chapter 19 they misunderstood God
[1:07:04] and they say all that the Lord God will
[1:07:07] say we will do brother brandham says
[1:07:10] they challenged God in another sense
[1:07:14] they were trying to say that we are able
[1:07:16] to keep the Commandment of
[1:07:19] God whatever Church order you gave us we
[1:07:22] will do what other you asked us to do we
[1:07:25] will do it the prophet of God said that
[1:07:28] was the fal mistake that Israel ever
[1:07:30] made they forsook the grace of God and
[1:07:34] they asked God for Lord that was where
[1:07:36] the Ten Commandments came from God never
[1:07:40] gave Israel 10 commandments they asked
[1:07:42] for
[1:07:44] it praise the Lord when you think that
[1:07:48] you are living a holy life you are
[1:07:51] asking you are demanding God
[1:07:54] praise the Lord you are not appreciating
[1:07:56] the grace of God when you think that
[1:07:58] your life is better than another
[1:08:00] person's life and you think that you
[1:08:02] more closer to God than another person
[1:08:04] you are not appreciating the grace of
[1:08:08] God you are you are Desiring something
[1:08:12] more harder is almost like okay I know
[1:08:14] I'm Justified now I need sanctification
[1:08:17] I need to be more Sanctified oh I know I
[1:08:20] Sanctified get the Holy Ghost I want to
[1:08:22] be adopted
[1:08:24] that's the way people understood the
[1:08:26] statue of the perfect man they think
[1:08:28] that you can gain faith and then you
[1:08:30] gain virtue and then you grow to no
[1:08:33] that's not what brother brandham
[1:08:35] said that was not what he taught it's
[1:08:39] not something that you gain one after
[1:08:42] another it's all in your
[1:08:45] birth when you are born again it's in
[1:08:47] your birth and as you walk with God and
[1:08:51] love God you begin to manifest those
[1:09:02] things that's what I like Wednesday
[1:09:13] night Sunday I have too many faces
[1:09:16] looking at
[1:09:19] me Wednesday night I just have
[1:09:22] few praise the
[1:09:25] Lord so brother Bram said God knowing
[1:09:29] what will have
[1:09:32] come knowing what would have come that
[1:09:35] there was going to be battle there was
[1:09:38] going to come a
[1:09:41] conflict so he gave his children the
[1:09:45] best
[1:09:48] protection praise the Lord he gave them
[1:09:52] the best protection
[1:09:55] the word is not given to you for you to
[1:09:58] do the word is given to protect you for
[1:10:01] you to stay
[1:10:05] behind praise the Lord but no we don't
[1:10:07] want to stay behind you know what we do
[1:10:09] we take our
[1:10:11] pen we like to underline
[1:10:18] cycle praise the Lord because we really
[1:10:21] want to understand this thing so we can
[1:10:23] do it
[1:10:24] that's not what the word was given for
[1:10:27] praise the Lord now don't misunderstand
[1:10:29] me now I'm not saying it's wrong for you
[1:10:31] to
[1:10:32] underline praise the Lord because if
[1:10:34] there is one man that is guilty of it I
[1:10:37] am you look in my Bible it's all with
[1:10:40] with all the colors on
[1:10:42] Earth praise the Lord but I'm trying to
[1:10:46] make you to understand the word was not
[1:10:49] given for us to
[1:10:52] do
[1:10:54] like something we have to learn to
[1:11:03] do are we
[1:11:15] together God equipped his children with
[1:11:17] the right kind of ammunition the right
[1:11:20] kind of attack the right kind of
[1:11:23] everything bank that they had need of
[1:11:26] that will sweep them all the way from
[1:11:30] Eden to the
[1:11:35] Rapture to the Rapture one
[1:11:42] word just one
[1:11:46] word what did the thief on the cross
[1:11:49] needed to do just one
[1:11:52] word you will be with me in Paradise all
[1:11:56] he needed to do was to believe
[1:12:00] it all he needed to do was to believe
[1:12:07] it praise the
[1:12:14] Lord that's the reason why the prophet
[1:12:16] of God challenged us that we will come
[1:12:19] to service after service and the word
[1:12:22] will be preached to us oh over and over
[1:12:26] again he said just
[1:12:28] one
[1:12:30] message must be
[1:12:36] enough when God gave them that word when
[1:12:39] he commanded
[1:12:42] them you see this sometimes it's uh is I
[1:12:46] think I think uh h h a translation you
[1:12:50] know trying to find the best word to be
[1:12:52] able to express the the mind of God man
[1:12:55] choose word because if if you talk about
[1:12:57] com command I give you command it means
[1:13:00] that you do what I
[1:13:03] say but that's not what God
[1:13:06] meant praise the
[1:13:10] Lord because he already know by the law
[1:13:13] no flesh is
[1:13:15] Justified praise the
[1:13:19] Lord what is the what is what is the use
[1:13:21] of it if you keep all the Lord break one
[1:13:23] you are guilty of all then what is the
[1:13:25] use of keeping
[1:13:28] it praise the Lord what is the use of
[1:13:32] keeping it you see that's the reason why
[1:13:35] legalistic approach to God can never
[1:13:39] work it can never
[1:13:44] work he told
[1:13:47] Israel the Lord your God is one love the
[1:13:52] Lord your God with all your
[1:13:56] heart all your soul all your mind fall
[1:14:01] in love with God forget about what how
[1:14:05] much you can do and just fall in love
[1:14:07] try and fall in love with
[1:14:13] God falling in love with God is not
[1:14:15] thinking about if I pray this morning if
[1:14:17] I read my Bible this morning no fall in
[1:14:20] love with God learn toeach Express a
[1:14:23] Lord I love
[1:14:25] you I love
[1:14:28] you praise the
[1:14:31] Lord amen but you see the love of God
[1:14:35] has been attached to all sorts of things
[1:14:39] we understand it as if when we prayed
[1:14:41] and and and and and and and maybe uh the
[1:14:44] Lord has not answered us you know the
[1:14:46] question is there I mean it shows that
[1:14:50] yeah I know God Lov me he died for my
[1:14:52] sin but this one has not been given so
[1:14:54] all of that question trouble our
[1:14:59] minds but yet is his expression of
[1:15:02] love because sometimes he does those
[1:15:06] things he put us on in a in a tight spot
[1:15:09] sometimes he put us in a heart seat so
[1:15:12] we can come closer to
[1:15:14] him his way of drawing us closer to his
[1:15:19] love forget about what I have done
[1:15:22] because that is the first thing that
[1:15:24] stps the
[1:15:25] mind of of a of a Believer as soon as
[1:15:29] something happen we run in our mind what
[1:15:31] have I done did I break the word of God
[1:15:35] praise the
[1:15:37] Lord why why we always why our mind
[1:15:40] always channel that
[1:15:41] way when the Bible says why we were yet
[1:15:46] sinners while we were yet sinners astray
[1:15:50] from God he Lov us amen
[1:15:54] praise the
[1:15:56] Lord us when we while we were yet
[1:15:59] sinners is he going to change his mind
[1:16:01] now that we are
[1:16:04] believers
[1:16:09] hallu as soon as we have headache the
[1:16:11] first thing we're going to look for a
[1:16:13] sin in our
[1:16:16] life praise the Lord you
[1:16:20] eating the spoon break
[1:16:26] you don't ask yourself did I feel this
[1:16:28] spoon too
[1:16:30] much we don't think about that what have
[1:16:33] I done Lord
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:43] Jesus praise the
[1:16:49] Lord let's read a little baby here from
[1:16:53] the prophet of God we
[1:16:56] continue from Eden to the Rapture he
[1:16:59] said what was it their
[1:17:03] word what was it what did God equi his
[1:17:06] children with their
[1:17:09] word you see John expressing that the
[1:17:13] old commandment from the beginning he
[1:17:15] said it was their
[1:17:20] word it was the word it it was not a it
[1:17:24] was not rules and
[1:17:28] regulation praise the Lord no it was the
[1:17:35] word now think about this think about
[1:17:39] this before we go any further think
[1:17:41] about
[1:17:42] this if Satan never
[1:17:46] came to explain Eve away from that
[1:17:51] word it did not b father Adam and Eve
[1:17:54] whether they understood it or
[1:17:57] not praise the Lord no it did not bother
[1:18:02] them you never he you never read in
[1:18:04] Genesis where Adam went back and says
[1:18:07] what did God really means no it was it
[1:18:11] was an
[1:18:14] intruder praise the Lord it was an
[1:18:17] intruder that
[1:18:19] came and says do you really understand
[1:18:22] what is on the line
[1:18:25] here it did not bother
[1:18:28] them praise the Lord as long as God says
[1:18:32] give them his
[1:18:34] word of every tree of the garden you
[1:18:37] should
[1:18:38] eat the one in the middle of the garden
[1:18:40] the day you eat it thou sh die Adam say
[1:18:44] amen he went he went from church that
[1:18:46] night he didn't even remember why he
[1:18:48] said amen
[1:18:50] to praise the Lord he was just going
[1:18:54] about loving God naming the animals and
[1:18:56] and enjoying the eating and all of that
[1:18:58] until an intruder
[1:19:01] King until a preacher enter the
[1:19:06] church and now he has become a teacher
[1:19:09] and he want to teach the people what the
[1:19:12] word of God really
[1:19:17] means praise the
[1:19:21] Lord
[1:19:23] do you think Adam was waking up every
[1:19:25] morning and say Eve remember God says we
[1:19:27] must not eat that tree you think Adam
[1:19:29] was doing that he never he never had
[1:19:31] time for that he was enjoying giving the
[1:19:34] animals their names he was enjoying
[1:19:38] telling this tree to move from here he
[1:19:40] was enjoying being an amateur
[1:19:43] God when you are enjoying the Lord the
[1:19:47] love of God you are enjoying the
[1:19:49] manifestation of the word of God you are
[1:19:52] not worried about dos and
[1:20:04] Don are we
[1:20:07] together brother Braham said what was it
[1:20:10] what was it that God equipped his
[1:20:12] children with what was It was supposed
[1:20:15] to take them from Eden all the way to
[1:20:17] the
[1:20:19] Rapture he said it was the
[1:20:21] word
[1:20:23] the
[1:20:25] word that's what defeats Satan is the
[1:20:29] word it will defeat him any time any
[1:20:33] place
[1:20:36] hallu now why do we want to substitute
[1:20:40] something
[1:20:41] else when we have already got the best
[1:20:44] thing there
[1:20:48] is why do we want
[1:20:51] religion why can't we just fall in love
[1:20:55] with
[1:20:58] God why can't we just fall in love with
[1:21:02] God why we want to place something and a
[1:21:05] piece ourself and think when I do this
[1:21:07] God will be happy with me when I do this
[1:21:10] God will not be happy with
[1:21:12] me when we can just go on thanking God
[1:21:16] thank you for the breath of life thank
[1:21:18] you for watching over me the dead I was
[1:21:20] separated from my mother womb thank you

[1:21:47] given
[1:21:49] us men shall not live by bread alone but
[1:21:53] by every word that proceed out of the
[1:21:56] mouth of
[1:21:58] God why do we want to substitute
[1:22:03] there why can't we just enjoy the
[1:22:06] blessings of the
[1:22:08] word saying the scribes and and the
[1:22:12] Pharisees sat with Moses sat in Moses

[1:29:20] important nothing is above the word we

[1:32:59] same word is not a new
[1:33:04] commandment the message is not a new
[1:33:06] doctrine there not a new
[1:33:08] movement it's just the Holy Ghost
[1:33:10] picking up the promises for this
[1:33:17] age the new commandment I gave you is
[1:33:20] not a new commandment people is the old
[1:33:23] commandment from the
[1:33:24] beginning the word that God used to
