[Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] causing them to believe that he was truly the lord the polytheistic religion of the enemy began with the trinitarian doctrine it was way back there in antiquity that the one god in three persons idea came into existence how strange that our modern theologians have not spotted this but evidently just as duped by satan as their forebears were they still believe in three persons in the godhead let us be shown just one place in scripture where there is any authority for that doctrine is it not strange that while the descendants of ham went on their way in satanic worship which involved a basic concept of three gods that there is not one trace of the descendants of shem believing such a thing or having any ceremonial worship that involved even a type of it it is not strange that the hebrews believed hear o israel the lord thy god is one god if there were three persons in the godhead abraham the descendant of shem in genesis 18 saw only one god with two angels now how was this trinity expressed it was expressed by an equilateral triangle even as it is expressed in rome today strange the hebrews did not have such a concept now who is right is it the hebrews or the babylonians in asia the polytheistic idea of three gods in one came out in an image with three heads on one body he is expressed as three intelligences in india they found it in their hearts to express him as one god in three forms now that really is good modern day theology in japan there is a great buddha with three heads like the one we previously described but the most revealing of all is that which sets forth the trinitarian concept of god in a triune form of one the head of an old man symbolizing god the father two a circle which in the mysteries signified seed which in turn means the sun three the wings and tail of a bird dove here was the doctrine of father son and holy ghost three persons in the godhead the veritable trinity you can see the same thing in rome now let me ask once again is it not strange that the devil and his worshippers actually had more truth revealed than the father of faith abraham and his descendants is it not strange that the worshipers of satan knew more about god than the children of god now that is what modern theologians try to tell us when they talk about a trinity just remember this one thing from now on these records are facts and this is a fact satan is a liar and the father of lies and whenever he comes with any light it is still a lie he is a murderer and his doctrine of the trinity has destroyed the multitudes and will destroy until jesus comes according to history it did not take long for a change to be made in this concept of a father and a son and the holy ghost satan took them a step at a time away from the truth the evolved concept of deity was now one the eternal father two the spirit of god incarnate in a human mother does that make you think three a divine son the fruit of that incarnation woman's seed but the devil is not content he hasn't achieved worship of himself yet except in an indirect way so he takes the people away from the truth still further through his mysteries he reveals to the people that since the great invisible father god does not concern himself in the affairs of men but remain silent relative to them then it follows that he may well be worshipped in silence actually it means to ignore him as much as possible if not altogether this doctrine spread around the world also and right today in india you can see that temples to the great creator the silent god are strikingly few in number since it was not necessary to worship the creator father it was only natural that worship swung to the mother and child as the objects of adoration in egypt there was the same combination of mother and son called isis and osiris in india it was ishai and ishwara note the similarity of names even in asia it was sibyli and the oes in rome and in greece it followed suit and in china well imagine the surprise of some roman catholic missionaries as they entered china and found their a madonna and child with rays of light emanating from the head of the babe the image could well have been exchanged for one in the vatican except for the difference of certain facial features it now behooves us to discover the original mother and child the original goddess mother of babylon was samiramus who was called rhea in the eastern countries in her arms she held a son who though a babe was described as tall strong handsome and especially captivating to the women in ezekiel 8 14 he was called tamus among classical writers he was called bacchus to the babylonians he was ninas what accounts for the fact that he is represented as a babe in arms and yet described as a great and mighty man is that he is known as the husband son one of his titles was husband of the mother and in india where the two are known as ishwara and ishai he the husband is represented as the babe at the breast of his own wife that this ninus is the nimrod of the bible we can affirm by comparing history with the genesis account pompeo said nina's king of assyria changed the ancient moderate ways of life by the desire for conquest he was the first who carried war against his neighbors he conquered all nations from assyria to libya as these men knew not the arts of war diadorus says ninus was the most ancient of assyrian kings mentioned in history being of warlike disposition he trained many young men rigorously in the arts of war he brought babylonia under him while yet there was no city of babylon thus we see this niners started to become great in babylon built babel and took over assyria becoming its king and then proceeded to devour other vast territories where the people were unskilled in war and lived in a moderate way as said pompeus now in genesis 10 speaking of the kingdom of nimrod it says and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and iraq and akhad and khalna in the land of china out of that land went forth asser and builded nineveh and kayla etc but the translators made a mistake in translating asser as a noun for it is a verb and in the chaldee means to make strong thus it is nimrod who having been made strong he established his kingdom by building the world's first army which he trained by drilling and through the rigors of hunting went beyond shinar with his strong army and subdued nations and built such cities as nineveh which was named after him or even today a chief part of the ruins of that city is called nimrod since we have discovered who ninus was it is now necessary to discover who his father was according to history it was bell the founder of babylon now it is to be noted here that bell founded it in the sense that he started this whole move but it was the sun ninus that established it and was the first king etc but according to the scripture the father of nimrod was cush and kush begat nimrod not only is this so but we find that ham begat kush now in the egyptian culture bell was called hermes and hermes means the son of ham according to history hermes was the great prophet of idolatry he was the interpreter of the gods another name by which he was called was mercury read acts 14 11 through 12. hygiena says this about that god who was known variously as bell hermes mercury etc for many ages men lived under the government of job not the roman job but jehovah of the hebrews who predates roman history without cities and without laws and all speaking one language but after that mercury bell interpreted the speeches of men whence an interpreter is called hermeneuties the same individual distributed the nations then discord began it is seen from this that bell or cush the father of nimrod originally was the ringleader that led the people away from the true god and encouraged the people as the interpreter of the gods to take another form of religion he encouraged them to go ahead with the tower which his son actually built this encouragement is what brought the confusion and the division of men so that he was both interpreter and confuser cush then was the father of the polytheistic system and when men were deified by men he of course became the father of the gods now cush was called bell and bell in roman mythology was janus he is pictured as having two faces and he carried a club by which he confounded and scattered the people ovid writes that jaina said concerning himself the ancients called me chaos thus we find that the cush of the bible the original rebel against monotheism was called bell bellows hermes janus etc amongst the ancient peoples he purported to bring revelations and interpretations from the gods to the people in so doing he caused the wrath of god to scatter the people bringing division and confusion now up to this point we have seen whence polytheism or the worship of many gods came but did you notice that we also found a mention of a man named cush who was given a title of the father of the gods did you notice here the old theme of ancient mythologies that gods identify themselves with men that is where ancestor worship comes from so we might just examine history to find out about ancestor worship well it was brought out that cush introduced a three god worship of father son and spirit three gods who were all equal but he knew about the seed of the woman coming so there would have to be a woman and her seed come into the picture this was brought to pass when nimrod died his wife semiramis deified him and thus made herself the mother of the son and also the mother of the gods just exactly as the roman church has deified mary they claim she was without sin and was the mother of god she samiramus called nimrod zero ashta which means the woman's promised seed but it wasn't too long until the woman began to attract more attention than the sun and soon she was the one who was depicted as trampling underfoot the serpent they called her the queen of the heaven and made her divine how like today were in mary the mother of jesus had been elevated to immortality and right now as of september 1964 the vatican council is attempting to give equality to mary she does not possess for they would like to call her marry the mediatrix mary the mother of all believers or mother of the church if there was ever babylonish ancestor worship in a religion it is the religion of the church of rome not only was ancestor worship originated in babylon but so also was the worship of nature it was in babylon the gods were identified with the sun and moon etc the chief object in nature was the sun which has light giving and heat-giving properties and appears to man as a ball of fire in the heavens thus the chief god would be the sun god whom they called baal often the sun was depicted as a circle of flame and soon around that flame there appeared a serpent it wasn't long until the serpent became a symbol of the sun and consequently worshiped thus the desire of satan's heart became full-fledged he was worshipped as god his throne was established his slaves bowed to him there in pergamus in the form of a living serpent he was worshiped the tree of the knowledge of good and evil now symbolized in the form of a living serpent had not only seduced eve but the majority of mankind but how did pergamos become the seed of satan if babylon was the seed the answer again is in history when babylon fell to the medes and persians the priest king atlas fled the city and went to pergamus with his priests and sacred mysteries there he set up his kingdom outside the roman empire and thrived under the care of the devil this has been a very short resume of the history of the babylonish religion and its advent to pergamos many questions are no doubt left unanswered and much more no doubt could have been said to enlighten us but this is not intended to be a study of history rather it is intended to be a help to the study of the word the denunciation revelation 2 14-15 but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate in this pergamian age the lord denounces two doctrines which he hates one the doctrine of balaam which brought idolatry and sinful excesses to israel at baal pior and two the doctrine of the nicolaitans which had been but deeds in the ephesian age combine this denouncement with the fact that he has been emphasizing pergamus as the seed of satan and it is very easy and proper to conclude that somehow the religion of babylon has become intermingled with christianity now this is not merely an assumption but an historical fact which we will prove by going back into history to about 36 a.d and coming up to the nicene council of 325 when the christians mainly jews by birth were scattered abroad from jerusalem they went everywhere preaching the gospel particularly in the synagogues thus within three years or about in 36 a.d the gospel had been taken to rome by junius and andronicus who according to romans 16 7 were apostles the work flourished there for several years until the constant altercations of the jews amongst themselves caused emperor claudius to expel them from rome with the jews banished from that city the backbone of that little church was practically broken perhaps even the elders had been jewish and so would be gone the flock would be unattended and since the word had not been written as a guide it would be very easy for this little flock to drift or be inundated by the philosophers and pagans of that day with grievous wolves on the prowl and the spirit of antichrist released we find from history that this little church in rome became hopelessly backslidden and began to introduce pagan ceremonies under christian titles as the period of banishment lasted for 13 years the founders junius and andronicus did not come back until 54 a.d imagine their horror to find a church with a christian title that was woefully pagan there were altars in the church upon which they placed incense and celebrated pagan rites the established leaders of that church could not be approached so with the few who had tried to remain faithful they started a new church or the second church of rome god graciously worked amongst them by signs and wonders so that a third church was started and though the first church was reproached for being pagan and not christian in its worship it would not give up its title but remained and still remains the first church of rome the roman catholic church now the majority of us have the mistaken idea that any and all who call themselves christians would be the target of the devil and consequently the brunt of governmental tyranny but not so this first church had begun to thrive and multiply so in numbers that the emperors and various officials of the government actually favored that church for political reasons thus when the leaders of the first church in rome found themselves in favor they took the opportunity to turn the government against the true believers and demand their persecution unless they came into their fold one such bishop of the first church of rome was anacetus who lived in the second century and was contemporary with polycarp when the venerable polycarp heard that the first christian church of rome was involved in pagan ceremonies and had corrupted the truth of the gospel he went there to implore them to change he saw them prostrate themselves before images named after apostles and saints he saw them light candles and burn incense on the altar he saw them celebrate the passover under the name easter where they elevated the disc shaped bread that honored the sun god and then they poured the wine out as a libation to the gods but this aged saint who had traveled 1500 miles could not arrest their downward plunge god spoke through him just as he was leaving ephraim is married to his idols led him alone hosea 4 15 polycarp nevermore returned following anacetus was the wicked bishop of rome called victor he introduced even more pagan festivals and ceremonies into the first church and also went about trying his utmost to persuade the true christian churches to incorporate the same ideas they would not do as he requested so he prevailed upon government officials to persecute the believers hailing them into court casting them into prison and even meeting out death to many such an example of his vile deeds is found in history where emperor septimus severus was prevailed upon by callistus the friend of victor to kill seven thousand at thessalonica because these true believers celebrated the passover according to the lord jesus and not according to the worship of astarte already the false vine was turning loose its anger against the living god by killing the elect even as did its forebear cain kill abel the true church kept trying to get the first church to repent it would not do so it increased in size and influence it embarked upon a constant campaign to discredit the true seed they claimed that they and they alone were the true representatives of the lord jesus christ and wanted the fact that they were the original church in rome and they alone were the first church indeed they were the first church and indeed they are thus by the time of this third church age we have two churches bearing the same name but with a bitter difference between them one has departed from the truth married idols and has no life in her she has hybridized herself and the signs of death not life follow in her wake she is powerful with many members she is favored by the world the other is a little persecuted group but she follows the word and the signs follow her the sick are healed and the dead are raised she is alive with the life and word of god she loves not her life but holds to his name and his faith even unto death and so the terrible persecution of official rome fell upon the true believers until constantine arose and granted freedom of religious worship there seems to be two reasons why this freedom was granted in the first place various good emperors had not allowed persecution but as they passed on they were followed by those who killed christians it was so senseless that it finally came to public heed that the christians ought to be left alone the second and best noted reason is that constantine had a very difficult battle ahead of him in taking over the control of the empire one night in a dream he saw a white cross appear before him he felt that this was an omen unto him that if the christians prayed for a victory for him he would win the battle he promised freedom for them in the event that he was victorious he was victorious and the freedom of worship was granted in the edict of nance 312 a.d but this freedom from persecution and death was not as magnanimous as it first appeared constantine was now the patron as a patron his interest was somewhat more than that of an observer for he decided that the church needed his help in her affairs he had seen them disagreeing over various matters one of which involved arius bishop of alexander who taught his adherents that jesus was not truly god but a lesser being having been created by god the western church held the opposite view believing that jesus was the very essence of god and as they said co-equal with the father with such matters along with the intrusion of pagan ceremony into worship the emperor called for the nicene council in 325 with the thought that he would bring all groups together where they could iron out their differences and come to a common understanding and all be one isn't it peculiar that though this started with constantine it didn't die but is very much alive today as the world council of churches and where he failed to truly achieve it it will be achieved in this day through the ecumenical move now this interference of the state with the church is a foolish thing for the world does not understand either the truth found in the word or the ways of the church why the very decision handed down by the council that arius was wrong was reversed two years later by the emperor and for many years that false doctrine was fostered upon the people but that the church and state would come together was truly foreknown of the lord the very name pergamos means thoroughly married and indeed state and church were married politics and religion were united the offspring of that union have been consistently the most horrible hybrids the world has ever seen the truth is not in them but all the evil ways of cain the first hybrid is not only was state and church wedded in this age but the babylonian religion was officially joined to the first church satan now had access to the name of christ and he was enthroned as god in worship with the help of federal aid the churches fell air to beautiful buildings which were lined with altars of white marble and images of the departed saints and right in this age is when the beast of revelation 13 3 that was wounded to death the pagan roman empire came back to life and power as the holy roman empire rome as a material nation had suffered much depletion and soon would suffer it completely but it mattered not now for her religious empire would keep her on top of the world governing from the inside where she would not appear to do so from the outside let me show the exact scriptural truth of this matter for i do not want anyone to think that i am giving a revelation of my own one not found in scripture daniel 2 31-45 thou o king sauced and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was a fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou saws told that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou o king art a king of kings for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of man dwell the beasts of the fields and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and brews and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with myriad clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miri clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou sawest at the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure herein is revealed an exact account of future unfilled history that was prophesied to come upon the earth from the time of daniel until jesus would come and reign as the son of david it is known as the times of the gentiles it had within it four historical divisions which were known by the dominating empire in each division babylonian medo-persian grecian roman the greatest and most absolute monarchy was the babylonian which was typified as the head of gold the next in glory was the medo-persian which as history bore out was truly less glorious and was typified as the breast and arms of silver then there followed the grecian age whose king was the most brilliant of all military leaders the world has ever known so it was fittingly typified as the belly and thighs of brass it was less glorious than the other two preceding it finally came the last kingdom which was the roman empire typified as the legs and feet but wherein the former kingdoms were typified as pure minerals pure gold silver and brass this last empire was pure iron only in the legs for when it came to the feet it was a mixture of iron and clay and mineral and soil just don't mix and produce constancy and strength but not only is this so but most amazing this last empire roman would endure in its peculiar mixed state right up until jesus returns this roman empire of iron iron signifying power and great destructive force against opposition was to be made of two main divisions and it certainly was for the empire literally split into two east and west both were very powerful crushing all before them but as the glory and power of all empires fail so this empire began to fall also thus rome fell pagan imperial rome was no longer iron she crumbled she was wounded to death rome could not now rule it was all over so thought the world but how wrong the world was for that head rome the wounded was not wounded unto death west translation of revelation 13 3 and one of his heads appeared to have been mortally wounded the throat having been slashed and his death stroke was healed and the whole earth followed after the wild beast in amazement people look at rome they look at the nation of italy and as they look they do not realize that rome with her strict confines where the pope has an actual area as his domain is literally a nation within a nation and she has ambassadors and receives ambassadors papal false christian rome she has even called the eternal city how blasphemous now controls by religion even more ably than when pagan imperial rome controlled by the pure iron of force rome took on a new lease of life when constantine joined church and state and back the union by force the spirit that motivated pagan rome is the same spirit that now motivates false christian rome you can see that is so because you now know that the fourth empire never went out of existence it just changed in its outer texture once the nicene council had swung the power of political rome to the church it seemed that there were no limits to which this first christian church would go the name christian which originally brought persecution now became the name of the persecutors it was in this age that augustine of hippo 354-430 forth the precept that the church ought and must use force if necessary to bring her children back into the fold and that it was in harmony with the word of god to kill the heretics and apostates in his controversy with the donatists he wrote it is indeed better that men should be led to worship god by teaching and that they should be driven to it by fear of punishment or pain but it does not follow that because the former course produces the better men therefore those who do not yield to it should be neglected for many have found advantage as we have proved and are daily proving by actual experience in being first compelled by fear or pain so that they might afterwards be influenced by teaching so that they might follow out in act what they have already learned in word whilst those are better who are guided or right by love those are certainly more numerous who are corrected by fear for who can possibly love us more than christ who laid down his life for the sheep yet after calling peter and the other apostles by his words alone when he came to summon paul he not only constrained him with his voice but even dashed him to the earth with his power and that he might forcibly bring one who is raging amidst the darkness of infidelity to desire the light of the heart he first struck him with physical blindness of the eyes why therefore should not the church use force in compelling her lost sons to return the lord himself said go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in wherefore if the power which the church has received by divine appointment in its due season through the religious character and faith of kings be the instrument by which those who are found in the highways and hedges that is in heresies and systems are compelled to come in then let them not find fault with being compelled the thirst for blood was growing apace the false vine in spain now played upon the emperor maximus [Music] [Music]
