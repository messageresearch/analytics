[0:01] our leaf or
[0:05] this meeting is to be a little
[0:19] you
[2:52] as far as we know here and now we have
[2:57] give out the meeting Wednesday through
[3:00] Sunday but then it's Sunday is closing
[3:03] into Christmas holidays but it whenever
[3:07] the Lord tells us to stop that'll be the
[3:10] time we don't know just what the results
[3:13] will be but believing that the folks
[3:19] here at the Tabernacle and our sister
[3:21] churches which is one of them is is the
[3:25] holiness tabernacle at Utica which
[3:27] brother Grimm Snelling is a pastor and
[3:30] in New Albany where brother juni Jackson
[3:33] is pastor and also out on the highway
[3:36] where brother rattle is pastor we are
[3:41] and their sister churches of this
[3:43] Tabernacle we are trying to bring the
[3:49] our people into a better fellowship with
[3:53] Christ that's our purpose so I have
[3:58] chosen to read and to teach on for the
[4:02] next few nights tonight I want to speak
[4:05] on the subject of what is the Holy Ghost
[4:10] and tomorrow night I want to preach on
[4:16] what was it given far and on Friday
[4:21] night and to the recorders I don't want
[4:25] this recorded Friday night how do I get
[4:29] the Holy Ghost and how do I know when I
[4:32] have it then we will just let then see
[4:39] what the Lord will lead us for Saturday
[4:41] and Sunday and Sunday morning a healing
[4:45] service and another evangelistic service
[4:47] for Sunday night and now we want
[4:51] everyone to know that and I know the
[4:56] recorders is running in the backroom and
[4:59] we wish to say this because in these
[5:05] meetings like this on the evangelistic
[5:08] type we have people from different
[5:11] denominations of churches which has been
[5:14] taught in their own sphere our belief
[5:18] each one and that's alright I have never
[5:25] wanted to be guilty of sowing discord
[5:28] among brethren and out in the meetings I
[5:31] just preach on the great evangelical
[5:34] truths of the scripture on what brethren
[5:37] who sponsor my meeting believe in but in
[5:43] the tabernacle here I want to speak on
[5:46] what we believe therefore if you if you
[5:52] do not understand it I would be very
[5:56] happy to have a little letter or note
[5:59] from you to ask me a question of why
[6:04] that we believe it thus and I would be
[6:08] glad to try to explain it the best that
[6:12] I can you know every church if you don't
[6:17] have a doctrine you're not a church
[6:19] you've got to have something that you
[6:22] stand for some principles that you're
[6:26] holding up and regardless of what a
[6:33] person's affiliation our denomination
[6:36] might be if that person has burned all
[6:39] the spirit of God that's my brother or
[6:42] my sister regardless of we might
[6:46] different in other things as far as East
[6:49] from the West but we are still brothers
[6:52] and I would not do nothing but try to
[6:56] help that brother for a closer better
[6:59] walk to Christ and I believe any real
[7:02] true Christian would do the same for me
[7:06] now I've asked this Tabernacle now we're
[7:11] not entering into this just far up
[7:14] attractive meeting
[7:17] I want to enter into this and I want you
[7:21] and have asked you to burn every Bridge
[7:24] that's behind you and make every sin
[7:27] right that we're coming into this with
[7:31] all debts in our hearts and lives we
[7:36] must come here for the sole purpose of
[7:39] getting our souls ready for the coming
[7:43] of the Lord and for no other purpose and
[7:49] as I have spoken and said that maybe
[7:53] sometime I might teach or say something
[7:55] that might be a little contrary to what
[7:58] someone else will weigh they believe
[8:00] that idea did not comfort controversy
[8:06] I can't we're here to make ready the
[8:10] coming of the Lord and I think that this
[8:16] little group I've got some visiting
[8:18] brethren with me here I know from
[8:20] different places and we're happy to have
[8:23] him and no doubt the walk out to the
[8:25] audience there there's others from out
[8:28] of town from out from around our little
[8:30] joining cities here we're happy to have
[8:34] you and so appreciative of you if you
[8:37] love us well enough to come be here
[8:39] these things God may you take home with
[8:43] you my brother's sister the richest
[8:46] treasures God can pour in your heart is
[8:48] my prayer and to this little Tabernacle
[8:53] seeing I believe that it is one of the
[8:57] finest people that I believe its own
[9:00] earth goes to this tabernacle
[9:02] I never said all the finest people I
[9:04] said some of the finest people on earth
[9:08] go to this tabernacle but as day by day
[9:13] entering back from meeting to meeting I
[9:15] see a great need of this tabernacle a
[9:19] great need in it and that's far
[9:23] appealing our consecration a deeper life
[9:28] a closer walk with God
[9:31] and I have promised them to do this to
[9:34] have this message is for them and we're
[9:38] glad to bring you in and fellowship with
[9:41] us around the Word of God as we teach
[9:45] and try to bring out now the first three
[9:50] nights we will not be taken a subject of
[9:53] preach on but a message to teach from
[9:57] the Word of God and now for I would not
[10:03] ask anyone to do anything that I would
[10:06] not do myself and this week has been a
[10:13] complete Calvary for me I've been so
[10:19] close to to the blacking out as I would
[10:25] place it till I was almost beside myself
[10:30] but I have completely surrendered every
[10:35] will and everything that I know of to
[10:39] the Lord the other night at around
[10:43] little after midnight wife and I after
[10:47] setting up and praying and talking to
[10:51] the Lord across the little footstool in
[10:55] our front room with to open Bibles we
[11:00] consecrated ourselves anew to God for
[11:03] complete service that we would surrender
[11:08] our own will that everything and every
[11:11] negative thought and to serve the Lord
[11:14] Jesus not trusted that's been your
[11:18] attitude to that you've done the same
[11:21] thing then when we are coming tonight
[11:25] we're coming up on holy ground among a
[11:30] people who's been praying and fasting
[11:32] and making restitutions and getting
[11:35] ready to receive something from God and
[11:41] I know that he that will come
[11:44] we will not go away hungry but God will
[11:48] feed with the bread of life
[11:51] now before we read from his sacred book
[11:55] let us bow our heads just a moment for
[11:58] prayer Lord there has already been
[12:04] prayer offered in this place tonight
[12:09] there has been the songs of Zion has
[12:12] been sung by your children their hearts
[12:17] has been lifted up and we have come here
[12:22] to consecrate ourselves to thee and to
[12:28] worship thee from the depths of our soul
[12:33] and we are calling this to your
[12:37] remembrance Lord that you said when you
[12:41] set up on the mouth and taught your
[12:45] disciples blessed are they that do
[12:50] hunger and thirst for righteousness for
[12:54] they shall be filled
[12:58] you promised at large we are coming
[13:03] tonight with open hearts we are coming
[13:08] hungry and thirsty and we know you keep
[13:14] your promise as we endeavor to open up
[13:20] these sacred pages of the Bible to read
[13:25] from it the contents may the Holy Spirit
[13:30] just take it to every heart may that
[13:35] seed fall down into deep rich faith that
[13:41] will bring forth every promise that the
[13:44] word has made hear us Lord and cleanse
[13:50] us in trials
[13:55] and if there be any unclean thing about
[13:58] us Lord any unconfessed saying any thing
[14:02] that's not right reveal it just now or
[14:06] we'll walk right straight and do it far
[14:10] we realize we're living in the chapters
[14:14] of the coming of the Lord Jesus and we
[14:20] have our holy God come into the shadows
[14:24] of that justice tonight and we are
[14:28] pleading for a new dedication and
[14:33] consecration and feeling of the Holy
[14:36] Spirit in our lives
[14:39] seeing the revival fires begin to dim
[14:43] let us throw on wood of the word that it
[14:47] might Kindle a new fire that our hearts
[14:51] would be full of zeal sanctify us Lord
[14:56] to thy precious word and our blood and I
[14:59] Grace we plead and all thanks and praise
[15:04] will be done
[15:06] take all prejudice from our hearts
[15:09] cleanse us O Lord give us pure hearts
[15:13] and clean hands and clean minds that we
[15:18] might come into the sanctuary night
[15:20] after night rejoicing and filled with
[15:23] your spirit we ask this in Jesus name
[15:27] and for his sake amen
[15:37] I wish to read the word just now while I
[15:44] asked you to bring your Bibles your
[15:47] pencils your papers for scriptures if
[15:51] you so desire so it would be very fine
[15:56] and I while you're getting to the
[15:59] seventh chapter of Acts to begin with
[16:04] the answer the question are to start in
[16:08] answering the question what is the holy
[16:11] spirit there is nothing that will defeat
[16:18] Satan there's never been nothing on the
[16:21] earth yet that would ever defeat Satan
[16:24] like the Word of God Jesus used it in
[16:29] his great battle he said it is written
[16:33] and this morning while I've been
[16:36] listening a few days ago to a broadcast
[16:39] that seemed to want to tell that
[16:42] creation just come from some ashes
[16:44] blowing together and some phosphate and
[16:48] a few chemicals of the earth and the
[16:51] warm sunshine created the germ of life
[16:53] and brought out life how ridiculous when
[16:58] the sunshine will kill any germ of life
[17:01] lay a germ out in the sunshine it'll
[17:04] kill it immediately and there is no such
[17:10] thing but Satan trying to punch that at
[17:14] me now I've tried take him out a little
[17:17] Rebecca to school this morning and on
[17:19] the road back I started to turn the
[17:23] radio on again and I thought I'd get
[17:25] into that stuff again so I just turned
[17:27] it back off and as I going on up the
[17:30] street Satan said to me he said do you
[17:34] know that this man that you call Jesus
[17:38] was just a man like one day in his day
[17:41] like the Billy Graham Oral Roberts he
[17:45] was just a man that they began to have a
[17:48] few people to gather around me
[17:50] and say he's a great man a natural Holly
[17:53] become greater and then he become a god
[17:56] to them and now it's scattered all over
[18:00] the world since he's dead and that's all
[18:03] I thought of how to liar you are and
[18:09] then I turned just as I was crossing
[18:12] grim Street
[18:13] I said Satan you this talking to my
[18:17] conscience I'd like to ask you a few
[18:19] things
[18:21] who was that the Hebrew prophet spoke of
[18:25] that would come who was the Anointed
[18:28] Messiah what was up on those men who
[18:32] foresaw him and told his life thousands
[18:34] of years before he got here who wasn't
[18:38] it foretold it just to the letter and
[18:42] when he come they said he was numbered
[18:45] with the transgressors and he was he was
[18:48] wounded for our transgressions and he
[18:50] was he made his grave with the rich but
[18:54] he would rise up the third day and he
[18:56] did and then he promised the Holy Ghost
[19:01] and I've got it so you just might as
[19:04] well get away from it because it's
[19:07] written in the word and every word is
[19:10] true then he left just give him the word
[19:17] that does it he can't stand that word
[19:22] for it's inspired let's start reading
[19:27] tonight in the 7th chapter of the book
[19:30] of Acts then said the high priest are
[19:33] these things so and he said man and
[19:37] brethren and fathers hearken the God of
[19:42] glory appeared to our father Abraham
[19:44] when he was in Massa poni ax before he
[19:48] dwelt in Charen and said unto him get
[19:51] thee out of thy country and from thy
[19:53] kindred and common to a land which I'll
[19:57] show thee then que me out of the land of
[20:01] the Chaldeans
[20:03] and dwelt in Charen and front fence when
[20:08] his father was dead he removed him into
[20:11] this land whirring you now dwell and he
[20:17] gave him not inheritance in it no not so
[20:20] much as to set his foot on yet he
[20:24] promised that he would give it to him
[20:27] for a possession and to his seed after
[20:31] him
[20:32] when as yet he had no child God spake on
[20:37] this wise that his seeds his sojourn in
[20:42] a strange land and that they should
[20:46] bring them into bondage and entreat them
[20:49] evil for 400 years and the nation to
[20:53] whom they shall be in bondage will our
[20:56] judge saith God and add to that shall
[21:00] they come forth and serve me in this
[21:03] country and he gave him the covenant of
[21:07] circumcision and so Abraham begat Isaac
[21:11] and circumcising the eighth day and I
[21:14] think they got Jacob and Jacob begat the
[21:16] twelve patriarchs upon this place we
[21:21] wish to approach the subject which I
[21:26] think is the outstanding subject of
[21:30] today of the what is the holy spirit
[21:38] what is it
[21:40] and now the reason I have taken these
[21:43] subject in line like this you cannot
[21:47] come and receive the Holy Spirit unless
[21:52] you know what it is and you cannot
[21:57] receive it if you know what it is unless
[22:00] you believe it's given to you and it's
[22:05] for you and then you cannot know whether
[22:10] you've got it or not unless you know
[22:12] what results it brings
[22:16] so if you know what it is and who it's
[22:21] to and what action it brings when it
[22:26] comes then you'll know what you've got
[22:29] when you get it see that just would
[22:34] settle it just like I was talking to our
[22:38] brother Jeffrey's today and he said I
[22:42] would like to be at the meeting tonight
[22:44] but I'll be there tomorrow night he
[22:46] didn't know the meeting was going on
[22:48] because we didn't announce it just right
[22:50] here some of the brother Leo and them
[22:53] wrote to some of our friends and told
[22:55] him out of town
[22:57] well because we didn't have room now I
[23:03] said brother Jeffries if you sent me
[23:07] down to turn on one of your aura wells
[23:11] and I didn't know nothing about it I'd
[23:14] probably blow it up I might turn the
[23:17] wrong key or start the wrong motor I'd
[23:22] have to know how to do it before I did
[23:26] it and that's the way with receiving the
[23:29] Holy Ghost you've got to know what you
[23:33] are coming for and how to receive it and
[23:36] what it is now the first place the Holy
[23:42] Spirit has been promised we could take
[23:46] ten weeks and never just skip the age of
[23:50] this subject what the Holy Spirit is but
[23:54] the first thing I want to approach it
[23:56] just enough to give an outline each
[23:59] night then see the following night if
[24:01] there's any questions how many in here
[24:05] has not received the Holy Ghost been
[24:07] baptized with the Holy Ghost raise your
[24:08] hands you know the admin just look at
[24:11] the hand now I want to talk on it as a
[24:20] Holy Spirit being a sign
[24:22] [Music]
[24:24] for it is a sign we realize that
[24:29] that all promises is given to us by
[24:34] Abraham was a father of the promise
[24:39] because God gave the promise to Abraham
[24:43] and to his seed after him the promises
[24:48] made to Abraham and to his seed and this
[24:55] sign is to a covenant people now there
[25:01] is a vast difference between just a
[25:05] Christian and a Holy Ghost filled
[25:09] Christian and now we're going to get
[25:14] this from the scripture and place it
[25:16] just exactly in the scripture the first
[25:20] place there is a Christian professed to
[25:23] be a Christian but if this Christian has
[25:29] not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost
[25:32] he's only in process of being a
[25:36] Christian see he is professed to believe
[25:40] it he's working to it but God has not
[25:45] yet given him this spirit of the Holy
[25:48] Ghost he's not yet reached that goal
[25:50] with God that God's recognized it
[25:53] because that God made a covenant with
[25:58] Abraham after he had called Abraham
[26:01] which is a type of calling sick believer
[26:05] today he called Abraham and Abraham
[26:10] moved out of his country and went into a
[26:15] strange land to dwell among strange
[26:19] people and that was a type of when God
[26:25] called the man the stop is meanest
[26:28] repent of his sins he turns then from
[26:31] the crowd that he was in to live in a
[26:35] new crowd among new types of people
[26:41] and then after God found Abraham to be
[26:45] faithful to the promise that God gave
[26:49] him that he would have the child and
[26:51] through this child all the earth would
[26:53] be blessed
[26:54] then God confirmed his faith by giving
[26:59] him a sign and that sign was
[27:03] circumcision and circumcision is a type
[27:08] of the Holy Spirit just the very next
[27:12] verses of this chapter that we have just
[27:15] read if you want to take it down and the
[27:21] Stephen said in the 51st burst ye stiff
[27:26] necks uncircumcised in the heart and
[27:30] ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost
[27:33] as your father's did so to you the
[27:38] circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost
[27:43] and God gave Abraham this the
[27:48] circumcision sign after he had accepted
[27:52] God on his promise and walked out into a
[27:56] strange country it was a son and all his
[28:02] children and his seat after him should
[28:07] have this sign in their flesh because it
[28:10] was a distinction it was to separate
[28:14] them from all other peoples this sign of
[28:21] circumcision and that's what God uses
[28:26] today it's the sign of circumcision of
[28:31] the heart the holy spirit that makes
[28:35] God's church a separated church from all
[28:40] other Creed's days and denominations
[28:44] [Music]
[28:46] they're in all kinds of denominations
[28:49] but yet they are a separated people
[28:53] you let me talk to a man two minutes I
[28:56] can tell you whether you see the Holy
[28:57] Ghost or not so can you it separates
[29:03] them it's a mark it's a sign and the
[29:08] Holy Spirit is a sign and it's any child
[29:14] that refused circumcision in the Old
[29:19] Testament which was a foreshadow of the
[29:23] Holy Ghost was cut off from amongst the
[29:27] people he could not have fellowship with
[29:33] the rest of the congregation if he
[29:35] refused to be circumcised
[29:38] now pattern that to today a person that
[29:43] would refuse to receive the baptism of
[29:46] the Holy Ghost can have no fellowship
[29:49] among those that has the Holy Ghost you
[29:52] just can't do it you have to be a nature
[29:57] like it's my mother there used to say
[30:00] birds of a feather flock together well
[30:04] it's an old proverb but it's a true one
[30:06] you don't see doves and crows
[30:09] fellowshipping their diets are different
[30:12] their habits are different their desires
[30:15] are different that's the way it is with
[30:18] the world and with the Christian when
[30:21] you have been circumcised by the Holy
[30:24] Spirit which means to cut off a flesh
[30:32] circumcision could only be in the male
[30:36] but if the woman was married to a man
[30:39] she was part of him she was circumcised
[30:42] with him you remember and Timothy word
[30:46] said never notwithstanding she shall be
[30:49] saved in childbearing if she continues
[30:51] in faith and holiness with all sobriety
[30:53] now circumcision
[30:57] you know when the Sarah laughed in the
[31:01] tent behind her at the message of the
[31:04] angel when he said Abe
[31:06] ham not knowing who he was a stranger
[31:10] where is thy wife Sarah how did he know
[31:16] that he had a wife as Jesus said as it
[31:20] was in the days of love
[31:22] so will it be in the coming of the Son
[31:24] of Man remember those signs wasn't
[31:27] committed down to Sodom and Gomorrah in
[31:29] the world amongst the religionists but
[31:33] it was to the elect that called out and
[31:35] Abraham was called out and the word
[31:39] church means called out the separated
[31:44] like Abraham separate himself
[31:50] and then when Sarah left at the very
[31:54] message of the angel God would have
[31:57] killed her on the spot but he could not
[32:01] bother Sarah without bothering Abraham
[32:04] because they were one she was part of
[32:11] him you're no longer Twain but one so
[32:18] circumcision the holy spirit today
[32:21] circumcised is the heart and it's a sign
[32:25] a given side someone said the other day
[32:31] I just repeat this not as a joke because
[32:35] it's the truth
[32:36] but it sounds like a joke as I've often
[32:40] said this is no place for jokes but
[32:44] there was a little German out on the
[32:47] west coast where we were just add he
[32:51] received the Holy Ghost and he went down
[32:55] the street and he would walk a little
[32:58] piece and he'd raise up his hands and
[33:00] speak in tongues and he would run and he
[33:02] would jump and he would shout and he was
[33:05] at work carrying all I got and his boss
[33:07] said to him where have you been
[33:13] I like those places where you have been
[33:19] he said you must have been down amongst
[33:22] that bunch of nuts he said then you
