tonight from their homes and uh I saw through the email a brother wrote from Ghana uh uh uh commenting in one of our services through here so we all all those that are streaming in we just want to greet them and pray that uh uh we can be a blessing we've been dwelling on this subject about the effect of the move of God we want to look at tonight the move in Vision the move in Vision on Sunday we talk about Moses how God moved down and got into a burning bush and then got Moses attention and uh that that was another move because God moves in different ways amen amen there is a old song uh chorus that says uh the spirit of God uh uh the Holy Ghost is moving like a magnet it's moving here it's moving there he moving all about everywhere so we're going to see the move of God in different ways amen because God moves Upon Our Hearts he deals with every one of us in different way when he moved in Eden the Bible says the spirit of God move upon the water when he moved in the days of Noah he moved him to build an ark when when he moved on Abraham he moved him out of Babylon to a land he says I will give thee amen when he move to to Moses he moved in the burning bush tonight we want to look at the move of God upon Samuel 1 Samuel chapter 3 and something caught my mind from the service on Sunday uh I wish I I'll be able to have the opportunity to go back to there but for now let's just read the scripture and then you have the comfort of your seat and uh we remain standing we contining to pray for the uh coming of special meetings with uh brother Joel chikosi and uh I spoke with brother Brooks it looks like they they they all want to Cal down I don't know how many of them but uh we we just open ourself to expect expect guest so uh the might Clos their service and come down that's why he told me so uh he told me he and his wife coming so we will just trust and see how the lord it's too late for us to be able to go about booking anywhere now and you know moving instruments and all of there so we will manage the space after all it's a blessing amen and when we can create an atmosphere here bring the Holy Ghost to this location amen yeah the the angel of the Lord to this location is a blessing maybe he will come down and have mercy upon us amen he will come down discern our knees and say I need to help these people praise the Lord 1 Samuel chapter 3 let's read verse one and the charge Samuel Minister unto the Lord before Eli I wonder how did he Minister I wonder how that he Minister unto the Lord because right here in uh uh 1 Samuel chapter 3 there was is going to show us the first time that God will start dealing with him praise the Lord amen so you see we can Minister unto the Lord even before he start dealing with us right when we bring our children to church when they sing special praise the Lord they come to church they obey the the word of God the by their heads to pray you know they respect the ordinance of God we are ministering unto God all of those things create an atmosphere for God to start dealing with the individual amen the child Samuel Minister unto the Lord before Elam and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time that Eli was uh laid down in his place and his eyes began to watch them that he could not see and he the Lamb of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the Ark of God was and Samuel was laid down to sleep and the Lord called Samuel and he said yeah am I and he ran to Eli and said yeah am I for thou calleth me and he said I I call that lay down again and he went and laid down and the Lord called again sometimes we don't get it the first time amen he's the god of Second Chances third chances fourth chances because we always don't get it the first time praise the lord we we have to know that we are dealing with an internal God we are dealing with an invisible God there is no way you can get it the first time God will have to condition you by an atmosphere praise the Lord are we together and the Lord called and and and the Lord called yet again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to elot and said here am I for thou cth for that that calleth me and he answer I call not my son laay down again and Samuel did uh did not yet know the Lord but yet he Minister unto the Lord praise the Lord he did not yet know the Lord but yet he ministered unto the Lord praise the Lorden that's a proof that our children being born in the message still need a new birth amen they still need to be born again praise the Lord having our children in holy warlock is there is is no evidence of the Holy Ghost they need to know the Lord are we together now Samuel did not yet know the Lord Lord neither was the word of the Lord yet reveiled unto him and the Lord called Samuel again the third time and he arose and went to Eli and said yeah am I for that they called me and Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child therefore Eli said unto Samuel go lay down and it shall be if he called thee that thou shall say Speak Lord for thy servant hear it so Samuel went and laid down in his place and the Lord came and stood and called as at other times Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered speak for that seven year amen I I pray that that would be our answer to the Lord amen speak for the seven hear it let's pray Heavenly Father we just want to thank you tonight for giving us another opportunity to come together this Wednesday night we we are so grateful father Lord so grateful that Lord in such a time oh god oh Father where there is just lot of confusion in the land such a time oh god father where there is gross darkness and Lord there is such of a coldness Lord father that is beginning to to to to freeze in the faith of the people and and and and turn us into well weariness Lord and Slumber but yet oh God there's a little group of people oh father that you have candled your love in our hearts and Lord Jesus you have given us the opportunity while we stand here tonight we want to remember all your children that are standing in holy place tonight lifting up their hands to you may you remember them Father Lord even the ones in their home of God for one reason or another that can be with us tonight the ones that had to be at work we commit them into you your hands oh Father we just prayed once again Lord father undertake for all the prayer needs that were mentioned here tonight and the unspoken needs in the hearts of your children father we pray that Lord God you will undertake for us and you will rebuke the enemy Lord we thank you and we appreciate you tonight speak to our hearts now in Jesus name amen am amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat you may have your seat praise the Lord there's a place where brother Brandon mentioned how long a vision and dream takes place I will have pick up there tonight but uh uh I was I was looking through my my Cod notes and I couldn't find it but I will read that to you on Sunday and uh tonight what I want to look at is that uh we talking about the effect of the move of God and uh uh we've been looking at posi positive effect and negative effect praise the Lord Amen brother brandham says a Revival is the move of God in power praise the Lord amen are we together is the move of God in power so uh uh uh and and that's what we've been looking at uh uh tonight we want to look at the the the move of God uh on a vision and uh uh the prophet of God explained this uh uh verse to us when Jesus said I do nothing except that which the father show me he said that means Jesus had a vision everything that God wanted him to do he had a vision now take take take that in context and and and and think about he is the second Adam was that the way that God de with the first Adam that everything that the father wanted him to do the father will reveal to him in Vision could that be the way that God de with him are we together amen Jesus said I do nothing but that which the father shows me are we together praise the lord and there should be the same thing with every one of us we must do nothing but that which the father shows us we might not have an an open Vision we might not have Vision in the context of vision but we also have a vision we have a we have a spiritual Revelation that brings conviction to our hearts that this is what God want us to do amen praise the Lord so we want to just look at uh uh we want to go in that direction tonight brother Brandon uh uh hear his voice he took that scripture there he says and the and the child Samuel Minister unto the Lord before El and the word of the Lord was precious in those days for there was no open Vision see what what a vision is then is the direct word of the Lord amen a vision is a direct word of the Lord are we together amen see and the word of the Lord was precious now then he will he will he will say he he will let us to see this also let's let's look at this in the message the injur in his commission he said I was reading I was reading at the Bible of Daniel after he had those Vision he said he was troubled in his head for many days right we know John in the Book of Revelation after he had his vision he was imparted by the vision until he lie on the floor like a dead man so Visions have impact praise the Lord are we together Vision have impact when the word of God struck our heart and have impacted our life uh uh uh it's it's it's a revelation it's it's a form of vision are we together amen praise the Lord now where I want to go to uh uh the direction I want to go uh to tonight is that just like I said brother Bram talks and and make us to know that you can have a dream and it looks like you are dreaming all through the night he says but that dream is just between two three seconds praise the Lord amen it looks like like it's a whole night dream I was dreaming I went to New York and then from New York I flew over to Atlanta you know and I got on the train you know we were on the train we were traveling on the train but it's Just sh it's all because because you have to see that when we talk about move when you when we talk about move is an action of leaving one place to another so when you talk about move you we must also put speed into context praise the Lord you see that is the reason why we don't pick up the move of God at the first time because God is not moving in the way that our B regulate speed praise the Lord amen I will tell you that uh the kind of a speed that an airplane is on it can never carry that speed on the road on this road it's so fast it's above our driving speed limit that's the reason why you can drive from here to to to to Tennessee about almost 18 20 hours but you can take a two three hours flight and get to Minneapolis different speed are we together amen it's different speed yes so when we talk about the move of God his speed is is sometimes is too fast for us to see that's why Moses stood there waiting to see God and God passed he never saw it until when he turned around oh I saw it was a back part of a man and that is the kind of for Speed level that God is dealing with us changing our body changing our nature and because our mind don't understand speed that fast sometime it looks like God is not doing anything praise the Lord that's the reason why we get healed couple of days before we notice it we get delivered couple of days I mean after after we've been delivered before we know that oh my god oh wow this thing I was praying for the Lord has healed me why because it happened so fast praise the Lord it happened so fast let me let me uh uh uh uh uh I will go ahead of myself it's okay I go ahead of myself when you remember you remember in the the visions that led to the opening of the seals when brother brandham tell those Visions he said it first started with little birds he said when those little birds flew then they became bigger Birds just like doves and when those birds FLW then the Angels appeared it's the one and the same thing but from a distant it could look very little and as it move it look bigger praise the Lord amen it's almost like you flry in an airplane and you looking down on the City of Minneapolis it just look like toy houses because the Destin you are are we together amen so when he was seeing in a vision remember now the angels are bringing the secret that was H from the foundation of the world these angels are coming down from eternity from a distance the looks like little birds as they move closer to time they look like pigeon before he realize there are seven angels it's the speed you see that's the reason why you cannot put your justification your sanctification your baptism of the Holy you cannot put it on calendar it does not work that way no it does not work that way in January I was justified and and and in March no no April and I got Sanctified going have to take three months at least it got to be three it does not work that way it does not work that way right there on the cross the teeth was justified Sanctified and promis to be in eternity right there on the cross he got an impact are we together you see that is the thing that is happening in our ranks that we have not understood and we are running into conflict because we are still in the mind of of the church ages the church ages have their doctrines and their their their uh Reformation application what you need to do to be justified what you need to do to be Sanctified you know you need to you need to do this certain thing so all of those things and and because our mind it makes sense to us so our mind dwell in those things for the wine have are we together praise the Lord there there is somewhere I go into tonight and I hope I can be able to nail you there before we go home it sticks on your mind and you'll be able to go home and meditate upon it praise the Lord Brother b t over and over there are voices passing right in this building praise the Lord amen I heard him saying that I think yesterday he said I hope to live to the day where they will be able to grab the voice of Jesus on my NEC tape praise the Lord amen amen and we see science is trying to break into all of those things science is trying to break into all of those things so uh uh uh when we when you when you look at these things you realize that uh uh uh the Bible says there was there was no open Vision in in that time of Samuel uh there was not a prophet on the land there was not a prophet on the land the word of God uh you remember the people have gone through the time of the judges the judges uh uh uh is uh is a very good type of uh uh you know of the church ages God raising up man uh uh through the the time of reformation to be able to stand for the truth but yet God was going to to bring back his voice his leadership back in the church and he's going to raise up this young man Samuel praise the Lord amen and we see how God is dealing with him now all of these things is placed into into one or two verses in the Bible that it could look like the same night God spoke to him Eli said go and sleep then he he he come back again he say Eli did you call me Eli said go and sleep it could be a period of time it could be a period of time God is dealing with him praise the Lord maybe it is not a warm night and the reason why I'm saying it is because just like how those things took place in the Scripture it was their life their entire life was not in one day a man entire life could be explained in one chapter but it did not happen in one day right and that is the same same way with you and myself every day God is dealing with us one way or the other every day he's finding a new way to be able to get our attention every day he's finding a way to be able to amplify his voice to us my sheep hear my voice are they going to hear my voice is he going to grab what I'm trying to bring to him is she reading the Bible uh he's listening to a tape or listening to some kind of a gospel music or whatever it is are they hearing my voice he's trying to get our [Music] attention but you see because it's it's in such a speed it's in such a speed it's not traveling so the frequency of our our our our normal hearing our normal hearing frequency is traveling to the frequency of our soul praise the Lord amen are we together amen amen I I I I pray that U I pray you see it and you you understand it and appreciate it tonight praise the Lord amen because we talk in about the the positive and the negative negative effect of uh the the move of God praise the Lord I was I was uh kind of meditating on on these things and and I I I wrote some things down right after the service on Sunday I felt like the Lord uh uh like I said there was something I mentioned when I when I spoke about uh Lazarus you know uh uh coming from from the grave Jesus said Lazarus come forth and immediately he came forth and after being there 4 days is they did not took the B from on him take the ambulance and Rush him to the hospital put oxygen on him no he came forth his eyes were sharp his organs were all working praise the Lord am amen that is the effect of the move of God when when when Jesus spoke that voice that said let there be light was the same voice that said Lazarus come forth amen and when he came forth a move upon his entire body organs praise the Lorden if Lazarus was feeling pain when he died when he came forth there was no op when Lazarus was weak in his body when he died when he came forth he was strong in health that is the effect of the move of God for you to be healed God had to move upon your faith when Jesus said be heal according to your faith be it unto you according to your faith is because the the your faith that is in you has created an atmosphere for God to move upon it praise the Lord that's the reason why it's not the sensation you don't have or shaking your no is not a sensation it's you is you believing in your heart that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that God is real amen he's not an anient God he's real I don't see him but he's here I know he's here as much as I know that there is birth in my body I know that God is here tonight praise the Lord amen are we together oh what a mighty God we Ser so I was I was dwelling on that thought I was just I was just uh uh thinking about it Sunday and and and I mean a whole a whole lot of things started coming to my mind talk about the woman with the blood issue amen this woman has gone how many years how many years 12 years praise the Lord 12 years with this illness and just by the touch praise the Lord and Jesus said vet you left me he said who touch me Peter said what are you talking about because he couldn't understand it he didn't see it it was not visible but the faith of the woman was able to draw H H intal power it was able to draw creative power from almighty God amen that affected her right there and there we are in an atmosphere of speed sometimes that's the reason why after the preaching of the word you might not remember anything but there is one thing that was will stick onto you because the because the Holy Ghost is going in such a speed and he just dropped that one down in your soul it became so real to you are we together you see that's the reason why we can't edicate ourself to God we cannot edicate ourself to God the one that we are dealing with his int tner amen he's not a god of time he's in tner and just like I said when God started moving when he came down from eternity and he dropped down to time when he started moving he have never stopped for nothing and he's not going to stop for anything amen when we prayed and said Lord Jesus come uh uh he comes and and he honor our faith and he moves amen God don't believe in adolat he don't want you to make an idol out of him he don't want you to set set him in a corner or put him on your living room table and say this is my God this is the thing that have healed me know he comes he bless you and then he move on thank you Lord and that's the reason why sometimes you can be on the H tuop you are revelated you are happy the next day you are aside because you just Dro down back to time praise the Lord don't let the devil tell you you have backslid it amen don't let the devil tell you you need to go and do some some more sacrifice and Penance unto God you need to repent maybe it's because of this or that don't let the devil lie to you we have been brought into so much reality of God amen amen amen that tradition we have been brought into so much reality of God are we together can you imagine Elijah on the mountain with all of those angels there it was not the time that Elijah said open the seven eye GES eye before the they were always there and just like they were on the mountain with Elijah they are here tonight he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you and if he's with you inures I come about you praise the Lord the Angels were there and Gesa was afraid the angels are there with you and you are afraid it's the same thing the Angels were there he was afraid amen and said Master the syrians are coming amen Master the bill is due master all this is happening Master but the angels are there it is just for your feet to rise and become conscious that Jesus promised me he will never leave me he will never forsake me I don't know where I am tonight but I'm feeling so good praise the lord we have made so much Idol look at the woman that wash Jesus feet he said the many sins your many sins are forgiven he never told her uh uh you know you got to go be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and and and uh uh you know you got to be faithful in paying your ties and and you know you got to he he never give her all of those things right there in then there was a connection when he spoke those words he breathed upon her that same breath of life that makes man a living Soul amen amen took away the desire amen amen amen amen praise the Lord just coming into that present she was so uh h h h h i mean she couldn't control herself until the the the the Fountain of her tears broke she had enough tears to wash his feet praise the Lord she threw her head over to WEP his feet she didn't care what people were saying she didn't care what they they thought about her she was in his presence praise the Lord he said Simon I came to your house you didn't receive me he said but this woman have not ceased to wash my feet and and WEP them and kiss my feet and all and I mean how many sins are forgiven now you see the church people sat there because they have their Church rituals of how sins supposed to be forgiven you're supposed to go and confess to the priest you got to go and do this thing they say who is he to say her sin is Forgiven he's blaspheming praise the Lord amen they were saying that in their heart and their mind but what that woman was experiencing was something that had never happened to her before she was she was experiencing a feeling like a newborn baby the stars were becoming more brighter the colors of the tree was becoming clearer the air that she was breathing was becoming more fresh than ever before because something has gone through her speed it happened so quick that's the reason why you you cannot you cannot condemn a man you cannot condemn a woman when a person walks out of the street and come into this church it is our responsibility to be able to create a positive and decent atmosphere we must be saying Lord thank you for that lady thank you for bringing her here oh God help her speak to her heart we might not be sitting down there and just being critical see how she dressed she I mean the church we have just become so bad we don't have courage to witness we don't have courage to do followup yet when God in his Mercy bring people our way we drive them out by our our religious attitude we drive them out what would you have done if you were there that day and those men took stones to Stone that woman that was caught in adultery if many of us were there we would Stone her too she was condemned by the word she was caught in the heart she was to be killed oh thank God thank God thank God she she she she she she recognized this man and fell at his feet thank God I just believe because she was a daughter of Abraham I believe because she was a seed of God God led her right into his presence why would we have done the people coming in our M we don't even know if they went if they slept in adultery and came to church we don't know that we just judge them by the way they dress we judge them by the way I mean that that just a wrong attitude we're not inviting people to church let not drive the one that the spirit of God is leading we should not drive them by our attitude I mean it will be encouraging to meet them after church oh God bless you thank you for coming thank you for coming we love to see you again we don't have the grace to do that we look them up and down up and down yet the next Sunday they come again and then we look at them up and down and up and down and yet the grace of God bring them again may God help us amen like that young lady I told you about spoke to her a few days ago uh she has become uh uh an air host with uh I think either Spirit Airline or some country she says uh she said pastor that's why you don't see me all the time I I was able to go to school and and now I'm working with this Airline and uh just busy trying to put my life together and I told her I said I'm proud of you because I mean there were there were some things that she told me about the kind of life that she was in and she was tired I mean she came from freakling I mean I guess there are a lot of churches on the road she said when I took my phone your address was the first address that came up praise the Lord amen now what am I getting to tonight just like how God did with the teeth on the cross the woman caught in adultery because she came into that presence and uh and and the power of God has taken sin away from her life Jesus said neither do I condemn thee because he couldn't see it God have forgiven her God have cleansed her he said neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more he was not advising her he was telling her what has happened to her and that's how those things happen so fast so quick and what I want to say what bring me to all of this tonight is to say this to you brother Dan preach the other the other day stumbling but here I come that was beautiful amen that was very very beautiful I'm stumbling but I'm still coming that's a faith attitude and that's and that's what I want to say you know brother brandham said it was just like blind bimos someone told him he couldn't see it he first start say son of David have mercy on me son of David have mercy on me and he kept raising his voice and Jesus was on his road to be hanang praise the Lord he heard it he heard it blus couldn't see for perhap Jesus might have just turned and looked his way and make contact where is that child of Abraham that is calling me and it happened so quick and that is the thing that is going to happen for you and myself no matter what you are dealing with no matter what you are struggling with you had to hold to your vision you have to hold to your faith the little strength you have have to come to church use that strength and come the little strength you have to go and pray keep using it keep praying praise the Lord God is not a man that he can lie praise the Lord you can't put God on the test I kept praying for this I keep praying for this and and and my life is not changing it's because you are looking at yourself and you are not looking at him just keep calling just keep calling Jesus said ask the father anything in my name amen do you realize that most of the time we prayed but we don't ask we don't ask we don't ask the father because in our mind he knows our needs he knows our condition we go through in Genesis you are the Sea of the woman in Exodus you are the blood on the door Post in Leviticus that's that's wonderful after you finish praising him he say ask ask ask Jim says we don't have because we do not ask or we ask in a mess Lord You Know You Lord You Know Me Lord you say say before before I even pray you know what I want to say Lord you you you know you really know my needs no that's not the way say Lord I need you and I need you in this area of my life he said acts praise the Lord you read you read Matthew chapter 7 Jesus talk about uh uh act seek and knock if you if you if if you put them together it is it's just the acronym of Acts a is asking s is seeking K is knocking ask are we together you see because because the hour that we are living in there there is just so much demon pressure on the word that church life like brother Brandon said is filling out praise the Lord Church Life is feding out it's going away from the hearts of the people that lukewarmness is creeping we are just beginning to wear this thing like a uniform I'm me a message I'm me a message I'm inan a message and we can come how many years we are in the message you see but h h i mean there there are certain reality that we need to hold to amen are we together let me read these few things to you I let you go tonight and then we continue by God's grace on Sunday if the Lord bless us praise the Lord listening to this brother brandom said in the sear Church age he said be thou faithful unto death this really blessed my heart he said be thou faithful unto death hold your testimony hold your testimony whatever you are believing God for hold it even on your death bed hold it say Lord I I I I did not see this in my lifetime but I believe you can do it be fa fful unto death he does not say be faithful until death just hold until you die no hold hold so strong that you will keep holding and you pass through death and on the other side you are still holy but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousand yeah million have died during all the ages they die in a faith like antipa and faithful my faithful Witnesses and uh the the H not now their life dear unto death often we think that it will be almost impossible to be a m we think that you know we might never have to give our our life no that's not what makes you you you I am my child that's the reason why you give your life because the word just mean witness you are a witness they were Witnesses that's the reason why they die for their faith it's not their faith that makes them Witnesses are we together we we think that is impossible but there to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ the faith that we daily use the faith that you use to wake up in the morning the faith you use to pass the pages of your Bible still believing that the word of God is truth still believing that you can read that book and God can speak to you that's right Amen to you it don't looks like anything but in heaven it's resounding it's sounding so loud in heaven why because when God looks in your neighborhood he don't hear the voices of prayer when he look in your neighborhood he sees the abuses he sees the drugs he see everything but when he looks down he sees a little Blain over your house amen he said there's a Son of God there there's a daughter of God there it man not looks like you are doing great things for the Lord but hold on to what you are doing and do it very well are we together but there to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that uphold the polycaps and all the mares he says uh uh the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour amen blessed be God forever when the need is there God will give you Supreme Grace in that need in that hour in that need he will give you the faith it might looks like you don't have fa you are weak the devil is blasting your mind with all sorts of discouraging things and and and and I mean you get mind battles and and and and and I mean you you you you you you cannot even get a can't even get a good you don't even have a good prayer life but start one praise the Lord amen start one hold on to it when it even looks like you are coming to church and I'm not getting nothing for from church keep coming God might just design one service only for you and that will change your life forever that's why we don't look at people misbehavior and make look at people misrepresentation and then we turn our back on the word you don't have a revelation you didn't not have a vision you were just following others but when you have a vision you hold to that Vision you don't allow other people to influence your vision that's right no the prophet said it might tar it but it will speak for itself are we together am you love the Lord tonight see what he says here power of transformation this will be the last code for tonight and then I I'll allow you go home now that's what I'm trying to warn you all about that's what I'm trying coming behind brother Brandon with this statement that's what I'm trying to warn you when you see God's seed begin to take hold and what is God's seed the word when you see that the word is beginning to take hold in your life pay attention pay attention when you see God beginning to do something in your life and you know that it is not your effort it is not your struggle is the grace of God pay attention to that watch over it jealously when you see God SE begin to take hold to grow was out for that fellow coming in just as slck as he can be that's the devil now that's why we have to wash out quote scripture just to who wouldn't have it see watch him cuz he is a deceiver now you see here like in your group year this morning this evening I can say you got a program you got a vision there's a vision that keeps driving us here praise the Lord amen that's the reason why I mean even if it is just two person that's come is no reason to say well people are not coming let's just go home no praise the Lord let's come and sing few songs at least let's just read a ssal let's just say something to one another prayed and then we go home there's a vision there's a vision are we together so like he says here you got a program you got a vision now watch for that corruptor that's the devil he wants to corrupt the vision he will come and bring discouragement people will look at one another and give excuses oh why you know why and and for this reason and for that reason you know and and and all of that he want to corrupt the vision and pretty soon if if if uh you know if if many people are not coming to Wednesday night service then it looks like okay I mean people are not coming so I myself I'm not coming no if you can come come praise the Lord if there a reason why you can't come you know we also know that when you follow the service online and and you are praying and you are saying Amen to the word you are also bringing energy to the service amen now watch for th corruptor oh he will be slck and slide as he can be you see but keep your vision see keep holding to that keep holy to your vision praise the Lord he might come and just pass our way sometimes it just take one service for God to magnify himself before the people do something in our hearts and it just changed the Dynamics of the church it changed the Dynamics of our life it changed the Dynamics of why why we are here because Vision have an impact a true Vision will impact you just like how Daniel was troubled just like how uh little Samuel keep waking up and going back and forth and keep going back and forth that Vision was having an impact on that little boy well he could have said I went twice and he said he didn't call me so I'm not going again he could have done it are we together we are dealing with almighty God we're not just playing Church we're not just having a form of religion if we ever get to that place I mean we just wasting our time but what we are doing is that we are trying to hold a vision over your head and say look at this this is where this is what we want to do this is where we are going this is where we this is what we want to achieve God give us a New Testament Church what is a New Testament Church it was not a 5,000 Church a New Testament Church the Bible says they went from house to house breaking bread that's what the church is it's our home it starts from home it's the prayer meeting at home the reading of the word the the the discipline at home home the respect at home the atmosphere at home you love the Lord tonight praise the Lord he's moving here he's moving

need to create an atmosphere where God can move where God can move because there is an effect of the move of God there is a truth effect that can change a sinner to sin there is an effect that can
