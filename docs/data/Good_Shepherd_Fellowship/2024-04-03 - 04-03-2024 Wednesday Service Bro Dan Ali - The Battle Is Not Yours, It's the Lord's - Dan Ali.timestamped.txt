[20:14] Angel visiting the neighborhood and it
[20:17] was not only for that day it is still
[20:20] the same today amen is uh it's uh it's
[20:24] the attitude of the people towards the
[20:25] word that brings the angel in the
[20:28] neighborhood
[20:29] praise the Lord and uh for for about uh
[20:34] 25 going 27 years now we've being on the
[20:37] corner of this street this little place
[20:39] been dedicated to the house of God and
[20:42] uh and God has a reason why he stay
[20:44] keeping us here praise the Lord before
[20:47] we pray I just I just wanted to take uh
[20:50] uh this time to just remind us you know
[20:54] he has a reason why he keeping us on the
[20:56] corner of this uh Street
[20:59] because we have to know you know when uh
[21:02] Jesus gave that parable about uh uh the
[21:05] lord of the Harvest when he sent out you
[21:08] know his servants to go and call people
[21:10] to the feast you know uh uh and the
[21:13] people that were invited were all giving
[21:17] excuses and then he said told his
[21:19] servant go in the highways go in the
[21:22] byways praise the Lord and and for the
[21:26] time that uh uh some of the time we have
[21:29] SE around here we have seen people uh uh
[21:32] we have seen the Lord bringing people
[21:34] right from the streets you know uh
[21:37] people come without none of us inviting
[21:40] them and that is the reason why that you
[21:42] know we owe those people our best
[21:44] behavior because we did not invite them
[21:47] we must not use our attitude to send
[21:49] them away so uh uh uh and then I learned
[21:53] there child there was a young lady I
[21:56] think niik that came in the prayer
[21:59] in the prayer line on Sunday and just
[22:01] before I will I will start heading to
[22:04] church tonight
[22:06] brother brother zah Chason called me and
[22:09] he wanted me to bring greetings to the
[22:11] church and also thank you for for
[22:14] supporting the meetings on the weekend
[22:16] but he called me and then uh he told me
[22:18] he s brother one there there was a young
[22:20] lady that came through the prayer line
[22:23] and uh and I think she was under the
[22:25] influence of
[22:27] alcohol he he
[22:29] said for some reason right after the the
[22:34] service when I went over to the hotel I
[22:37] mean to the restaurant to eat that smell
[22:41] could not leave me he said when I went
[22:43] to my hotel room the smell could not
[22:46] leave me he says from that time till
[22:49] this time you know I still feel the
[22:54] smell yeah you know I'm I'm I'm I'm
[22:57] using it that way I still feel the smell
[23:00] I still smell the smell because I
[23:03] believe it was more of the
[23:07] spirit than just the
[23:10] smell praise the Lord and so he told me
[23:14] he said I just had a I just had a burden
[23:16] on my heart and just believing that God
[23:19] will deliver that girl from whatever
[23:23] Spirit was bothering her because from
[23:26] Sunday till now I can they smell it
[23:30] Spirits can
[23:32] smell Spirit have sin they can smell
[23:36] right praise the Lord you know and and
[23:40] brother Bram talks taught us about
[23:42] Spirit congregates you know when people
[23:43] come together every one of us we bring
[23:46] Spirits into the building and and and
[23:49] and sometimes just like the preacher

[23:55] Ghost is streaming for help the Holy
[23:57] Ghost is stream screaming saying
[23:59] somebody believe me somebody believe the
[24:01] Lord praise the Lord and when you say
[24:04] Amen to the word you are helping the
[24:06] Holy Ghost brother bam said also the
[24:09] wrong Spirit communicates in the
[24:11] building they ask for help they start
[24:13] streaming you know when somebody is
[24:16] doubting or somebody mind is wondering
[24:19] that spirit will start moving from one
[24:22] place looking for another person that
[24:24] will agree with the doubt or agree with
[24:26] the wrong attitude and that Spirit has a
[24:29] support if it does not have a support it
[24:32] will find its way out amen but if it can
[24:35] just find a Channel of support is going
[24:38] to DW it praise the Lord amen and
[24:41] sometimes it stick on the person the

[47:54] for just a moment
[47:57] praise the
[47:59] Lord God bless you Saints for
[48:02] coming it's good to see every one of
[48:07] you um
[48:10] sometimes um we we we take things for
[48:13] granted and
[48:15] um in a way we don't
[48:19] appreciate you know our coming
[48:22] together uh the Bible says we should not
[48:25] forsake
[48:27] the ging together of the
[48:28] Saints it's just
[48:31] heartwarming that when I am leaving
[48:34] home I can see on my mind's
[48:39] eye that this brother is going to be in
[48:42] church this sister is going to be in
[48:44] church so as I'm coming I have an
[48:49] expectation praise be to God so much so
[48:53] that when I come and I don't see you
[48:56] that would not stop me from enjoying my
[48:59] service that would not stop me from
[49:01] enjoying the Lord but I get so
[49:04] concerned what is it oh he's sick oh
[49:09] he's working um you know for sometimes
[49:13] uh we don't get any reason and uh praise
[49:16] be to God it's all well and good praise
[49:20] the lord we should count ourselves
[49:24] blessed praise the Lord
[49:29] um we are living in in in in in a very
[49:33] dangerous
[49:35] time in a desperate
[49:38] moment and desperate moments call for
[49:41] desperate
[49:43] measures life shouldn't just go on year
[49:47] in year
[49:49] out and you are always the same
[49:54] person that we are all Trav down the
[49:58] road and you are either at the same
[50:01] spot or you are
[50:04] backwards you have to pause and ask
[50:07] yourself what is going
[50:10] on what is going
[50:13] on those that I started with they are
[50:16] far going ahead and here I stand what is
[50:19] going
[50:21] on and if there is going to be any
[50:25] change you have to
[50:29] change never expect that you will go to
[50:32] bed and rise up the following morning
[50:36] and things have
[50:37] changed you want God to do something
[50:40] different you must also do something
[50:44] different you don't continue down the
[50:46] same path and you expect a change in
[50:49] your
[50:53] life I remember oh mine um praise God
[50:58] I'm going to say it now in one of the
[51:00] dreams I had one Once Upon a Time I Saw
[51:04] brother team in my dream and then he was
[51:07] so angry he just walked to me stood and
[51:11] looked at me like this and he didn't say
[51:14] anything and he turned back probably 20
[51:17] years ago I'm not very sure and then he
[51:20] started going so I called him I said
[51:23] Pape you can't go like that then he
[51:26] stopped and 10 I said you can't go like
[51:28] that then he came back and he told me
[51:31] until you are ready God is not ready but
[51:35] when you are ready God is ready so it's
[51:38] the same message I want to pass tonight
[51:41] until you are ready God is not
[51:46] ready but when you are
[51:49] ready you can be rest assured that God
[51:52] is
[51:53] ready we are living in a desperate time
[51:57] I remember yesterday afternoon I was
[51:59] waiting on the Lord in the office I was
[52:02] SE behind the desk the computer desk and
[52:05] there is this um whatever partition they
[52:07] have made I was sitting behind it and a
[52:10] young man came in the office and he said
[52:13] I'm looking for Dan and we are three
[52:16] Dans and yesterday everybody was at work
[52:20] so I heard him but I was busy and then
[52:22] he said something else I didn't even
[52:24] catch it and then he asked somebody
[52:28] asked him which of the dance then he
[52:29] said the Christian so when he said that
[52:31] then I lifted up my head they said oh
[52:33] yeah you are
[52:34] here praise the Lord then he said I hear
[52:38] you are a pastor I said no I'm not a
[52:40] pastor I'm only a preacher there he said
[52:44] what is the difference then I had the
[52:45] opportunity to tell him what the
[52:46] difference was then he asked me is Al
[52:50] your last name I said yes were you a a
[52:53] Muslim I said yes
[52:56] and you are now a Christian I said yes
[52:58] he said you
[53:00] know I am a Muslim and I am a
[53:04] Christian I go to church on Sundays and
[53:08] I go to mosque on
[53:11] Fridays and in fact I could relate to
[53:15] his
[53:16] condition this is the life of a
[53:19] desperate
[53:20] Soul a young guy I think he's about 24
[53:24] 25 years old that is is so desperate for
[53:27] the truth that is at the
[53:31] crossroads that is looking for
[53:34] help and I was just
[53:37] wondering probably all the years I spent
[53:40] in general meals it was probably because
[53:42] of this soul and I told him I said
[53:45] probably you and I need to be talking he
[53:47] said
[53:48] yes I'll be glad to talk to you and this
[53:51] morning he came and asked for my number
[53:53] and I gave it to him
[53:57] and I was just
[53:59] wondering he doesn't know where he
[54:04] belongs so these are the two dominant
[54:08] religions so let me just hold on to the
[54:11] two so if the Christians are going and
[54:14] the Muslims don't go I go with
[54:16] them if the Muslims are going and the
[54:18] Christians don't go I go with
[54:20] them but then you would realize
[54:23] that if the Muslims were going and
[54:27] assuming just assuming the Christians
[54:29] were not going they will tell you that
[54:31] you know you were not fully
[54:33] committed so you are not going
[54:37] anywhere and when the Christians are
[54:39] going not
[54:44] if then it's just going to be you are
[54:47] not
[54:47] committed but praise be to God we know
[54:51] what the truth
[54:52] is we know where we stand
[54:56] we know what we have
[54:58] believed praise be to
[55:01] God without
[55:03] Christ life is completely
[55:06] empty what you think is life is
[55:10] death what you think is joy is
[55:15] sorrow without Christ you have no hope
[55:21] whatsoever Paul said for me to live is
[55:24] Christ and to die is gain and the way
[55:26] they call heresy that is the way we
[55:28] worship the god of our
[55:30] fathers there comes a
[55:32] time you have to call a
[55:37] halt do an introspection search your
[55:41] heart and
[55:42] see where you want to go what you want
[55:46] to
[55:48] do it's no longer there is no more time
[55:51] to play
[55:52] church when you look at the prophecies
[55:54] the Bible has given all all these years
[55:57] I mean there is nothing that is left
[56:00] it's homegoing
[56:02] time praise be to God it is homegoing
[56:06] time praise the
[56:10] Lord time is not our friend
[56:14] tonight praise the
[56:16] Lord
[56:17] and by the grace of
[56:20] God I
[56:22] just want us to look at something
[56:26] um a few things I have just put down
[56:28] here trusting the Lord that is going to
[56:31] be a blessing to us
[56:33] tonight um if we can please stand for
[56:36] the reading of the word turn to uh 1
[56:39] Samuel
[56:45] 17 1st Samuel
[56:49] 17
[56:51] um
[56:53] 32 1732
[56:57] praise the
[57:00] Lord count yourself
[57:02] blessed praise
[57:04] God it doesn't
[57:07] matter whether we have the things of
[57:09] this
[57:10] life um God will supply all our needs
[57:13] according to his rightous and
[57:15] Glory so whatever the need be I mean if
[57:19] God should bless you with the wealth of
[57:21] this world and then you don't you don't
[57:24] you don't make it at the end of the day
[57:26] today what is the use of
[57:28] it Lord have
[57:30] mercy if I have to be poor and be riched
[57:34] in this life in order to serve God in
[57:37] sincerity and with all honesty I will do
[57:40] it and do it to the glory of God praise
[57:42] the
[57:44] Lord thank you Jesus uh
[57:47] 17:32 I read and David said to Saul let
[57:51] no man's heart fail because of him thy
[57:54] servant will go and F with this
[57:57] Philistine and Saul said to David Thou
[58:00] Art not able to go against this
[58:03] Philistine to fight with him for thou
[58:06] art but a youth and he a man of war from
[58:10] his Youth and David
[58:12] said unto Saul thy servant kept his
[58:16] father's
[58:18] sheep okay let's drop to
[58:22] 37 and David said moreover the Lord have
[58:26] have delivered me out of the P of the
[58:29] lion and out of the P of the bear and he
[58:34] will deliver me out of the hand of this
[58:39] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[58:44] the Lord be with thee praise be to God
[58:48] praise be to God father may you add your
[58:51] blessings to the reading of your word
[58:52] tonight Lord we pray thee in Jesus name
[58:56] amen shall we be
[59:01] seated praise the
[59:08] Lord now when you read this
[59:12] story the children of Israel were at war
[59:15] against the
[59:18] Philistine the armies of Israel had
[59:21] encamped on one side of the Hill the
[59:24] mountain and on the other side side were
[59:27] the
[59:29] Philistines
[59:31] and for 40
[59:35] days this human
[59:37] Mountain will just come down the
[59:40] hill and then just brag and brag and
[59:43] brag and
[59:46] brag and call the children of God
[59:50] names because he told them give me a man
[59:56] if I kill him you will serve us if he
[59:59] kills me we will save
[1:00:01] you but this was a man that was so
[1:00:08] strong
[1:00:09] huge a
[1:00:12] warrior and there was nobody in the camp
[1:00:16] of
[1:00:17] Israel among the
[1:00:19] generals that could face
[1:00:21] him and he would just come and brag and
[1:00:25] brag and brag and scream and the Bible
[1:00:29] says when he is coming
[1:00:32] down the children of Israel they they
[1:00:35] they
[1:00:36] flee that was how scary he
[1:00:41] was and Jesus sent David because his
[1:00:45] three brothers were
[1:00:47] there go see how your brothers are
[1:00:50] doing send this food to them and then
[1:00:54] bring me back a report
[1:00:57] and David went he got there whilst he
[1:01:01] was there speaking with some of them
[1:01:04] here comes Goliath Goliath again and
[1:01:07] then he started defying the army of the
[1:01:10] Lord of
[1:01:11] Israel and then David turned and looked
[1:01:14] at
[1:01:15] him they said what is going on they said
[1:01:18] oh this man this is what he has been
[1:01:21] doing for the past 40
[1:01:23] days and there is no man in in the camp
[1:01:26] of Israel to fight him he is so so so
[1:01:30] strong he's been fighting war from his
[1:01:32] youth he is a warrior among Warriors the
[1:01:36] man is difficult he said
[1:01:39] no I would not stand and look at this
[1:01:42] man defy the army of the
[1:01:44] Lord and he said if
[1:01:48] somebody what would what would they do
[1:01:50] for somebody that would would would
[1:01:52] defeat this man would kill him they said
[1:01:54] oh the King has PR he going to make him
[1:01:57] Rich the King has promised he's going to
[1:02:00] give that man his daughter to marry and
[1:02:02] his house would be the the house of his
[1:02:05] father will be
[1:02:06] free and then he kept going and still
[1:02:11] asking what would the king do for any
[1:02:15] man that fights this man and kills him
[1:02:18] he kept getting the same message over
[1:02:20] and over until somebody went to saw
[1:02:25] there is a young
[1:02:26] here who thinks he can fight goath so
[1:02:31] what a young man he said call him over
[1:02:36] and here comes
[1:02:37] David and then he looks at
[1:02:39] David in that small
[1:02:44] body and he tells
[1:02:46] David you know you can't fight this man
[1:02:50] this man has been fighting since from
[1:02:52] his
[1:02:53] youth there is nobody in the the camp of
[1:02:56] Israel that can withand
[1:02:59] him you
[1:03:01] know sometimes in this
[1:03:08] life in your service to God you are
[1:03:12] going to get to a
[1:03:14] place where people are going to
[1:03:16] discourage
[1:03:18] you and they are not doing it with any
[1:03:21] bad
[1:03:23] intent this is SA
[1:03:26] a man of his stature and then he's
[1:03:29] seeing this small
[1:03:31] boy going against this man a man they
[1:03:35] have been running away from for 40
[1:03:38] days he was only showing that parental
[1:03:43] concern it's not with any bad
[1:03:48] intent and this is
[1:03:50] where you have to encourage yourself it
[1:03:54] is not all the time somebody has to
[1:03:56] encourage
[1:03:59] you it's not all the
[1:04:01] time you have to encourage yourself you
[1:04:05] have to speak to
[1:04:07] Yourself Praise the
[1:04:09] Lord and this is where having an
[1:04:13] experience with God is very
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:19] important praise the
[1:04:23] Lord because the trials of of
[1:04:26] today are preparing you for the battles
[1:04:30] of
[1:04:33] tomorrow and when he was
[1:04:35] done thinking David was going to say oh
[1:04:38] thank you I need to go back thank you
[1:04:41] for saving my life David said no I am
[1:04:44] going to fight him seeing he has defiled
[1:04:47] the army of the Lord praise the
[1:04:51] Lord he said you know I was taking care
[1:04:54] of my fathership in the wilderness
[1:04:56] the lion came and took one I killed it
[1:04:59] and delivered the Sheep a bear came I
[1:05:02] took it by the beard and I slew
[1:05:05] it and
[1:05:08] I can kill this
[1:05:11] man I can fight
[1:05:14] him then Saul
[1:05:17] realized that he was not just dealing
[1:05:20] with an
[1:05:22] ordinary
[1:05:24] citizen that this man had experienced
[1:05:30] something he never have heard
[1:05:33] of if I was a
[1:05:36] shepherd and a lion came and took
[1:05:40] one as a matter of fact I can if the
[1:05:43] lion could even hear me I would tell him
[1:05:46] if you can take more go
[1:05:48] ahead to save my skin to save my life I
[1:05:53] would never run after the lion
[1:05:56] and Saul realized that no this is
[1:05:59] something else he say you know what go
[1:06:03] the Lord be with
[1:06:04] you he said let not your heart fail
[1:06:08] because of this
[1:06:13] man and when he
[1:06:17] went before
[1:06:19] Saul when he went before when he went
[1:06:23] before Goliath
[1:06:26] Goliath looked at him with disdain who
[1:06:29] are you a little boy like
[1:06:33] you you are just a bad boy you didn't
[1:06:36] get a good
[1:06:37] training even the Army generals are
[1:06:40] running away you are coming I will kill
[1:06:42] you and and feed you to the Beast the
[1:06:44] Beast of the field I said no you telling
[1:06:47] Li is going to be the other way
[1:06:49] around you have defied the army of the
[1:06:52] Lord you are coming against me
[1:06:56] with your sword with your Spears and in
[1:06:59] the name of your Gods I come against you
[1:07:04] in the name of the Lord God of the army
[1:07:07] of Israel praise be to God now if God
[1:07:13] had opened Goliath's
[1:07:15] eyes the way he opened the eyes of the
[1:07:18] donkey Bam's donkey to see what he was
[1:07:22] going against he was going to run for
[1:07:24] his dear life he didn't know he was
[1:07:27] looking at that small David but beyond
[1:07:30] that praise be to God my
[1:07:35] goodness the host of the army of the
[1:07:38] Lord was right there ready for
[1:07:43] action it was like Elijah elishah
[1:07:46] elishah and his
[1:07:49] servant when he went out that early that
[1:07:51] morning and he saw that the armies of
[1:07:54] the syrians the enemies had encamped
[1:07:56] right about them he went in master we
[1:07:59] are in
[1:08:00] trouble the city has been encamped right
[1:08:03] about by the enemy and he prayed and
[1:08:07] asked God to open his eyes to see and
[1:08:10] when God open his eyes he saw that
[1:08:14] Chariots of Fire had encom about them
[1:08:18] ready for action and they were just
[1:08:20] waiting for the servant of God to give
[1:08:23] an instruction
[1:08:26] and that took all the fear away praise
[1:08:29] be to God we are not
[1:08:32] alone never think you are
[1:08:35] alone when the battle gets so
[1:08:39] tough when it gets so
[1:08:42] rough and you can feel that
[1:08:44] heat and you think is you are all alone
[1:08:48] You Think You Are by yourself that is
[1:08:50] the voice of the
[1:08:53] devil there is more with you
[1:08:56] than there is with them praise the
[1:09:00] Lord and
[1:09:01] now we know how the story
[1:09:04] ended praise the
[1:09:11] Lord
[1:09:16] now when you read
[1:09:21] down David actually took himself
[1:09:25] out of the
[1:09:28] equation it was the L Barrel as he
[1:09:32] said it was not David's
[1:09:36] Barrel it was the Lord's
[1:09:40] Barrel he only needed a
[1:09:43] vessel to
[1:09:47] use and David came right on
[1:09:51] time and he availed himself
[1:09:55] and God just stepped in
[1:09:58] him and used that
[1:10:02] vessel now David picked five stones in
[1:10:06] the message Witnesses 1953 045
[1:10:12] e the prayer of God said
[1:10:15] watch he had five

[1:12:09] certain no uncertainty about that praise
[1:12:13] be to
[1:12:15] God David said let not your heart fail
[1:12:19] because of

[1:12:31] him because of who because of the
[1:12:35] devil let not your heart fail because of
[1:12:39] him now the devil was defeated in
[1:12:44] heaven the battle we are fighting today
[1:12:47] it was the Battle of angels not the
[1:12:50] Battle of
[1:12:51] men that war started in heaven and the
[1:12:54] devil was defeated then he was Lucifer
[1:12:57] at the time and then he was cast
[1:13:01] down
[1:13:02] now this is
[1:13:05] where we have to
[1:13:10] watch The Devil sweet talked to tears of
[1:13:14] the angels in
[1:13:15] heaven to go to
[1:13:18] war against
[1:13:23] God and when he came to the the garden
[1:13:25] again he did the same thing to Eve sweet
[1:13:30] talked
[1:13:33] her and before she realized what was
[1:13:36] going on it was
[1:13:40] over that is why we are not called to
[1:13:48] rason never try to reason with the devil
[1:13:52] he will rason you out
[1:13:56] a man that was able to deceive
[1:13:59] angels to go to war against God and you
[1:14:03] think you can reason with

[1:14:09] any man would ever
[1:14:12] be so you don't ever
[1:14:14] Rasen with the devil we are called to
[1:14:17] express our
[1:14:18] faith that you get to a place though you
[1:14:21] don't understand you believe it because
[1:14:23] it is the word of God
[1:14:26] you don't know what is going on you
[1:14:29] check your life and everything is good
[1:14:32] you are doing the best you can for the
[1:14:34] kingdom of God and yet still things are
[1:14:37] not what they are supposed to be you
[1:14:39] don't reason that
[1:14:41] out you don't reason that
[1:14:44] out let your faith in God be
[1:14:49] certain there is no uncertainty about
[1:14:53] this today I I am a child of God
[1:14:56] tomorrow something happens no I am not
[1:14:58] saved I'm no longer a child of God no
[1:15:01] children of God are born children of
[1:15:04] God there is no way a sheep would ever
[1:15:09] die a goat if you are a sheep you will
[1:15:12] die a
[1:15:14] sheep praise the
[1:15:20] Lord let your
[1:15:23] faith EX press
[1:15:26] faith in the word of God not only when
[1:15:29] it seems
[1:15:30] convenient praise the
[1:15:33] Lord now when the fall took place and
[1:15:38] God came down he pronounced
[1:15:40] judgment on
[1:15:43] Eve for Adam he cast the ground and now
[1:15:47] when he got to the serpent he said
[1:15:50] because you have done
[1:15:53] this on thy
[1:15:56] belly you would go and dust you would
[1:16:00] eat all the days of your life and he
[1:16:03] said Genesis
[1:16:06] 3:15 I am going to put an
[1:16:09] emity between you and the woman and
[1:16:15] between the woman's seed and thy seed
[1:16:18] and he shall bruise your
[1:16:21] head and you shall bruise his heel
[1:16:26] praise the
[1:16:28] Lord praise the
[1:16:32] Lord
[1:16:34] now Christ was the seed of the woman
[1:16:38] that Bru the serpent
[1:16:40] said it was him
[1:16:43] then and it's him now for no man can
[1:16:48] withand the
[1:16:49] devil now Romans
[1:16:53] 16:20 says
[1:16:56] and the God of
[1:16:58] Peace shall Bru Satan under your feet
[1:17:06] shortly praise the
[1:17:09] Lord so it is not
[1:17:12] you the God of Peace shall Bru
[1:17:17] Satan but under your
[1:17:21] feet it is not you
[1:17:25] it is God doing it through
[1:17:33] you for the prophet of God
[1:17:36] said that he has no hands but our
[1:17:40] hands he has no feet but our
[1:17:46] feet so he is going to use those feet to
[1:17:50] Bru the
[1:17:52] devil now in the message Christianity
[1:17:55] versus adolat 1961
[1:17:59] 1217 every sickness every every devil
[1:18:04] every Power even death itself is under
[1:18:08] your
[1:18:10] feet under your
[1:18:13] feet this is bringing bringing us to a
[1:18:16] place of
[1:18:18] Authority for you to know who you are
[1:18:21] and where you
[1:18:22] stand that you are not any common person
[1:18:27] yes the world may see
[1:18:30] you as a common person and we are are we
[1:18:37] not you may never be invited to the
[1:18:39] White House you may never even get to
[1:18:42] know the mayor of your
[1:18:44] city nobody may even take notice of you
[1:18:48] in the community where you live but when
[1:18:51] heaven looks
[1:18:52] down God knows that I have a son and I
[1:18:56] have a daughter here and guess what the
[1:18:59] angels of the Lord Encompass run about
[1:19:03] you by day and by night that when you
[1:19:06] move they move when you stand they stand
[1:19:10] when you sit the S when you are sleeping
[1:19:12] they are keeping watch over you praise
[1:19:14] be to
[1:19:15] God you are not just anybody know who
[1:19:19] you
[1:19:23] are that you are a son that you are a
[1:19:27] daughter of the almighty
[1:19:32] God that even death even death is under
[1:19:36] your feet now as Romans 16:20 says and
[1:19:41] the God of Peace shall bruise Satan
[1:19:43] under your
[1:19:45] feet if the
[1:19:48] devil is sitting on top of your head it
[1:19:52] shows that Christ has not come
[1:20:01] if you are standing to to Toe with the
[1:20:03] devil in the ring it shows Christ has
[1:20:06] not come in
[1:20:12] yet but when Christ comes
[1:20:15] in remember the barrel is the Lord's
[1:20:19] barel it's not
[1:20:21] yours it's between God and Satan between
[1:20:24] right and wrong between just and unjust
[1:20:27] it is not your
[1:20:33] ble before we came into the
[1:20:37] picture men and women had already come
[1:20:40] and
[1:20:40] gone today is our turn to fight if
[1:20:45] Christ hares we will be gone tomorrow
[1:20:49] the younger generation will come and
[1:20:50] continue the
[1:20:52] fight but it is the same God and the
[1:20:56] same
[1:20:59] devil praise the
[1:21:03] Lord so if the devil is on your head or
[1:21:07] on your shoulder or on your neck it
[1:21:10] shows Christ has not come in
[1:21:14] yet because the Bible says in the Book
[1:21:18] of Romans and the God of
[1:21:21] Peace shall bruise the devil under your
[1:21:27] feet the word has placed him there he
[1:21:31] has no choice it is not your strength it
[1:21:35] is not your doing the word of God that
[1:21:39] says Let There Be and there
[1:21:42] was that word has placed the devil under
[1:21:47] your
[1:21:48] feet thank and the devil knows
[1:21:51] better that when God comes in
[1:21:55] the devil takes his place under your
[1:21:58] feet thank when God comes in when that
[1:22:02] word has become flesh in
[1:22:05] you the devil knows better where to go
[1:22:08] you don't have to instruct him why
[1:22:11] because the word has placed him there
[1:22:14] that's right there is so much power
[1:22:17] that's right in the word of God there is
[1:22:20] so much Authority in the word of God
[1:22:24] that when you put that word on your lips
[1:22:27] and you speak it it's as good as de
[1:22:31] speaking
[1:22:32] it praise the
[1:22:35] Lord oh what a mighty God we
[1:22:39] serve so it is not
[1:22:42] you God bless you sis Nicole good to see
[1:22:46] you
[1:22:49] amen amen praise the Lord
[1:22:58] praise the
[1:23:00] Lord now so you
[1:23:03] realize that the
[1:23:05] barel is not our Barrel it is the Lord's
[1:23:10] barrel and the only reason the devil
[1:23:12] will come under your feet is because
[1:23:14] Christ has coming
[1:23:26] so the
[1:23:28] question is
[1:23:30] never the question is never whether the
[1:23:35] devil knows where to go or
[1:23:39] not the question is not whether the
[1:23:43] devil knows who he is or not that is not
[1:23:46] in
[1:23:48] doubt the question is do you know who
[1:23:51] you are
[1:23:56] do you know what Authority you
[1:23:59] have do you know what power you
[1:24:03] have that sometimes we sit down and we
[1:24:07] are engulfed with
[1:24:10] problems that problems take over our
[1:24:12] lives and we sit down and we cry and we
[1:24:15] Mur And We complain as if we don't have
[1:24:18] a
[1:24:22] God praise the Lord
[1:24:26] but always
[1:24:28] remember that you are a son and a
[1:24:31] daughter of the Living
[1:24:33] God in whose hands there is
[1:24:37] power that you can change your
[1:24:40] circumstances you don't have to accept
[1:24:43] anything or everything that comes to
[1:24:48] you when situations come speak to
[1:24:52] them when sicknesses come place them
[1:24:54] where they belong when the devil shows
[1:24:57] up let him know where he
[1:25:00] belongs thank
[1:25:02] you praise the
[1:25:05] Lord let not your heart fail because of
[1:25:10] him the devil is under your feet and now
[1:25:14] there is an ongoing
[1:25:17] barel because God the word of God has
[1:25:21] placed him under your feet what do you
[1:25:23] have to do just walk over
[1:25:26] him just Place him on where he belongs
[1:25:29] walk over him just like shut
[1:25:34] up
[1:25:36] now if you are walking and the devil is
[1:25:40] under your
[1:25:42] feet have no mercy on the
[1:25:46] devil the devil is not a friend he's an
[1:25:49] enemy
[1:25:55] just like the
[1:25:57] like the that went to
[1:26:02] church and they were
[1:26:05] singing
[1:26:06] Brun Brun it means I step on Satan I
[1:26:10] step on Satan and he was singing I step
[1:26:13] on Satan I step on Satan sitting in his
[1:26:16] wheelchair and then he goes to bed and
[1:26:19] then he gets a dream the devil shows
[1:26:23] up you
[1:26:25] in church when they were singing I step
[1:26:28] on Satan I step on Satan you are also
[1:26:32] singing I step on Satan I step on Satan
[1:26:34] with what legs you don't have legs with
[1:26:37] what legs were you stepping on
[1:26:40] Satan now you would think the
[1:26:43] was going to say oh I'm sorry it was
[1:26:46] just a song everybody was singing and I
[1:26:48] was also singing I didn't mean it no
[1:26:51] that was not that
[1:26:52] he said I was not stepping on
[1:26:55] you with my legs I was stepping on you
[1:26:58] with the legs of Christ praise the
[1:27:01] Lord and the devil just jumped he said
[1:27:05] yeah if you joke I will do it again he
[1:27:07] said no I just came to find out he said
[1:27:09] no I stop on you in the name of
[1:27:12] Jesus and the devil just fled praise the
[1:27:17] Lord know who you are know where you
[1:27:20] stand don't take any foolishness from
[1:27:22] the Devil
[1:27:24] we cannot fear God and fear Satan at the
[1:27:26] same time how can you a child of God my
[1:27:32] goodness my goodness praise be to God oh
[1:27:38] mine the devil doesn't belong anywhere
[1:27:42] but under your
[1:27:44] feet praise the Lord
[1:27:58] now it's interesting as I was looking at
[1:28:01] this subject something came
[1:28:03] up okay I don't know do we have enough
[1:28:07] time I'm not
[1:28:11] sure praise the Lord so now as I was
[1:28:14] looking at this something came
[1:28:18] up that when you look at the feet of a
[1:28:21] man
[1:28:24] okay you look at the feet you have the
[1:28:27] toes you have the soul of the feet um
[1:28:30] and then you have the
[1:28:32] heels now the Bible is very
[1:28:36] specific the word of God
[1:28:39] says and he will bruise your head and
[1:28:43] you will bruise his
[1:28:45] heels and now when you look at it the
[1:28:49] heel we all know where the heel is the
[1:28:52] back part of the leg and then it just
[1:28:55] struck me it just struck
[1:28:59] me that when the devil bruises your heel
[1:29:03] what he is doing he is keeping you on
[1:29:06] your toes for
[1:29:07] God praise the
[1:29:10] Lord he keeps you on your
[1:29:13] toes he puts you in a fighting
[1:29:16] mode the best boxer this world has ever
[1:29:19] known was Muhammad Ali and in the ring I
[1:29:22] have seen him on his toes
[1:29:24] just dangling from one side to the other
[1:29:26] all through the 12 rounds he is on his
[1:29:29] toes
[1:29:31] fighting and you can be on your toes you
[1:29:34] can stand you can walk on your toes
[1:29:38] praise the Lord but I wonder how many
[1:29:41] people can do this on their on their
[1:29:43] heels no you can't so when the devil
[1:29:45] bres your
[1:29:48] heels when he is at his worst he brings
[1:29:52] the best out of you he puts you on your
[1:29:55] toes in a fighting mode for
[1:29:58] God that you put the devil where he
[1:30:02] belongs praise the
[1:30:04] Lord
[1:30:12] hallelujah
[1:30:15] now it also calls for
[1:30:18] caution it also calls for
[1:30:21] caution because the the Bible has placed
[1:30:25] him under our
[1:30:28] feet and is he there
[1:30:32] sleeping no he is
[1:30:36] there to
[1:30:38] fight the Devil is a
[1:30:41] fighter so and if a man is
[1:30:47] Fallen he is either
[1:30:50] sleeping or he will just slide as we
[1:30:55] seea a lot of
[1:30:57] times uh in snow or he will stumble
[1:31:02] there is something in the way he
[1:31:03] stumbles and he
[1:31:05] falls so when the devil is under your
[1:31:08] feet and you know the devil is under
[1:31:10] your feet it is not time to be
[1:31:13] Reckless it is time to be careful it is
[1:31:17] time to be
[1:31:19] cautious it calls for
[1:31:21] diligence in your work that you are
[1:31:24] careful how you walk you are careful
[1:31:27] where you go you are careful where you
[1:31:31] stand you want to be
[1:31:34] sure and very
[1:31:37] sure that every step you
[1:31:41] take you are being
[1:31:44] careful the steps of the Lord the steps
[1:31:47] of the righteous are ordered of the
[1:31:50] Lord the Bible says Thy word is a J onto
[1:31:54] my
[1:31:55] feet and a light onto my
[1:31:59] path the only thing that can keep you
[1:32:01] away from trouble is the
[1:32:04] word if you stay with the word there is
[1:32:08] no way you can ever get into
[1:32:11] error there is absolutely no way the
[1:32:16] reason why we get into error the reason
[1:32:18] why we get into trouble is because we
[1:32:20] set the word aside
[1:32:25] but if you stay with the word and the
[1:32:28] word takes a hold of your life my
[1:32:32] goodness there is absolutely no
[1:32:36] way you can ever get into
[1:32:40] error because it is the word that is
[1:32:43] keeping
[1:32:46] you praise the Lord
[1:32:54] and the
[1:32:56] worst the worst that can ever happen to
[1:33:00] you is to
[1:33:03] fall the worst that can ever happen to a
[1:33:06] child of God is for the devil to cause
[1:33:10] you to
[1:33:14] fall
[1:33:18] now what
[1:33:21] happens that even when you have
[1:33:25] fallen the Bible says a just man shall
[1:33:30] fall seven times and Rise
[1:33:36] Again seven times and rise
[1:33:43] again if you fall it's a child of God
[1:33:45] that has fallen you don't have to stay
[1:33:51] there you can catch a sheep and put the
[1:33:55] ship in Muddy Waters the ship would
[1:33:58] never keep quiet it will shout and shout
[1:34:01] and shout and shout and tell the
[1:34:03] shepherd I am here I need
[1:34:08] help he doesn't stay there because it is
[1:34:13] not in the sheep's
[1:34:16] DNA to stay in an environment like
[1:34:19] that so when a child of God when you
[1:34:23] fall is a child of God that has fallen
[1:34:26] you have not become a devil and the the
[1:34:30] just shall fall seven times and rise
[1:34:32] again and even the Bible says even where
[1:34:35] your heart condemns
[1:34:37] you know that God is greater than your
[1:34:41] heart and knows all
[1:34:45] things so you have no
[1:34:50] excuse praise the Lord
[1:34:54] let not your
[1:34:56] heart let not your
[1:34:59] heart fail because of him now there is
[1:35:03] so much power in the word of
[1:35:07] God just cultivate that habit if you are
[1:35:10] not doing
[1:35:12] it do not let a day pass by without you
[1:35:16] having to take the Bible sit down and
[1:35:19] have a true communion with God do not
[1:35:23] let don't let a day pass by without you
[1:35:27] having to just sit down take a tape a
[1:35:30] message and listen to it feed your
[1:35:34] soul the devil knows how much power
[1:35:37] there is in the word of God and if there
[1:35:39] is anything he can do to take you away
[1:35:42] from the word he will do
[1:35:45] it that is why you'll be lying down all
[1:35:50] day you don't have any plans to do
[1:35:52] anything but as soon as you take your
[1:35:55] bible to read that is when you think of
[1:35:59] the beggars in the fridge oh I'm hungry
[1:36:02] oh let me put it down it's just the
[1:36:06] devil because the devil
[1:36:09] knows where your anchor
[1:36:12] is he knows what your Fortress is he
[1:36:16] knows what your stronghold is if he can
[1:36:20] only get you away from it that is enough
[1:36:23] for
[1:36:25] him when he sent the 70 disciples the
[1:36:28] Bible says he sent them in
[1:36:30] PE to go and heal the
[1:36:33] sick and cast out devils and they
[1:36:37] went and they healed all manner of
[1:36:40] sickness and diseases and they cast out
[1:36:43] demons and when they came back they were
[1:36:46] rejoicing and
[1:36:48] shouting and Jesus told them that when
[1:36:51] you guys were there I saw Satan fall
[1:36:54] like lightning from the heavens praise
[1:36:58] be to God and lot of the times we do not
[1:37:01] know what goes on when we get on our
[1:37:04] knees I pray God to open our eyes so we
[1:37:08] can just see a glimpse of what happens
[1:37:11] when we go on our knees that heaven
[1:37:14] hears us when we
[1:37:16] pray they didn't
[1:37:18] know that the devil was falling from the
[1:37:22] from the heavens like light
[1:37:24] they didn't know praise be to God when
[1:37:28] you pray something
[1:37:30] happens every time you pray something
[1:37:33] happens you may not see it in a day you
[1:37:36] may not see it in a week you may not see
[1:37:38] it in a month you may not even see it in
[1:37:40] your
[1:37:41] lifetime you may be dead and gone praise
[1:37:45] be to God my
[1:37:48] goodness that
[1:37:51] prayer would be answered
[1:37:56] and they came rejoicing and Jesus told
[1:37:59] them don't only Rejoice because of this
[1:38:02] but also Rejoice that your name is
[1:38:05] written in the L's book praise the
[1:38:12] lord we are an invincible army of the
[1:38:20] Lord we are
[1:38:24] we cannot be
[1:38:28] defeated all that the father have given
[1:38:31] me they will
[1:38:35] come brother Bram said if you are too
[1:38:39] stubborn and you a child of God if it
[1:38:42] will cause God to to just take you
[1:38:45] home he will do it and save your
[1:38:49] soul but God is not going to lose even
[1:38:53] one
[1:38:54] one we are an invincible Army you must
[1:38:58] say I've been having a lot of problems
[1:39:00] I've been having a lot of difficulties
[1:39:02] oh my life is just full of ups and downs
[1:39:05] oh
[1:39:08] sometimes so
[1:39:12] what does it change the
[1:39:15] picture what
[1:39:17] shows that we are an invincible Army is
[1:39:21] that sometimes the
[1:39:24] devil would actually get you get under
[1:39:28] your
[1:39:30] skin that you you feel that you are torn
[1:39:34] apart you are
[1:39:36] broken you
[1:39:38] feel that your life is St upside
[1:39:43] down you feel that things are not adding
[1:39:46] up and the devil brings you to a place
[1:39:49] to say that oh I have gotten him or I
[1:39:52] have gotten her
[1:39:54] they are never going to go back again oh
[1:39:56] I've succeeded and then you can't wait
[1:40:00] for the next
[1:40:02] service that when the church doors are
[1:40:05] open you are there that you may be on
[1:40:08] your knees you may be
[1:40:10] struggling oh you may cry all night pray
[1:40:14] all night your heart is sore and then
[1:40:18] you just wash your face and then you put
[1:40:20] some cream on your face just to look
[1:40:22] presentable you come nobody knows what
[1:40:24] you are going through until sometimes
[1:40:26] you have to put in a prayer request or
[1:40:28] maybe confide in somebody and then the
[1:40:30] devil looks at you but I thought I was
[1:40:33] done with this
[1:40:34] person I thought I was they were
[1:40:39] finished God is using you to confound
[1:40:42] the
[1:40:44] enemy he has used all his tricks he has
[1:40:48] used all his tactics he has used all the
[1:40:52] techniques
[1:40:54] all the
[1:40:55] strategies and he has nothing more to
[1:40:59] use and you are just going
[1:41:02] on going
[1:41:04] on that sometimes you can just cry and
[1:41:07] cry and cry pray pray pray pray that you
[1:41:12] can stand lift lift your hands up and
[1:41:14] praise the Lord with tears running
[1:41:18] down and the devil is
[1:41:20] wondering oh
[1:41:24] I thought I had this person it's because
[1:41:27] you cannot be
[1:41:31] defeated there is no place for
[1:41:36] failure and when I say there is no place
[1:41:39] of failure I am not mean saying this to
[1:41:42] mean that if you have failed there is no
[1:41:45] place for you that is not what I'm
[1:41:47] saying what I'm saying is that if even
[1:41:50] you decide I want to fail
[1:41:53] You Can't
[1:41:56] Fail You Can't
[1:42:01] Fail You Can't
[1:42:03] Fail there is no place for
[1:42:10] it we are an invincible army of the Lord
[1:42:13] It's
[1:42:14] 9:05 praise the
[1:42:19] Lord God is so so honored
[1:42:24] God is
[1:42:26] honored when he sees a child of God he
[1:42:30] sees his child taking the word and
[1:42:34] living by it it's an honorable thing to
[1:42:39] God just step
[1:42:42] down when a child is being obedient to a
[1:42:47] parent it brings Joy to the
[1:42:50] parents and much the same way
[1:42:54] when God sees that his son his daughter
[1:42:58] has taken his word with all the
[1:43:01] struggles with all the difficulties with
[1:43:04] all the problems they have to go through
[1:43:07] with all the ups and the Downs they are
[1:43:10] going through and they are doing their
[1:43:13] best living the best they know praise be
[1:43:16] to God God is honored in
[1:43:21] that that was why
[1:43:25] God was very very
[1:43:27] displeased with the children of Israel
[1:43:30] when they got to cadesh
[1:43:34] B God had given them the
[1:43:37] land Moses takes 12 people to go and spy
[1:43:40] the land and when they come back 10 have
[1:43:43] an evil report to
[1:43:46] give they were not looking at the
[1:43:48] promise of God they were looking at the
[1:43:50] Giants
[1:43:53] God was expecting them to act like David
[1:43:57] did David was not looking at the size of
[1:44:01] Goliath praise be to God his faith was
[1:44:04] Anchored In God they were looking at
[1:44:07] those people said no these are giants we
[1:44:10] are not able to take the land and God
[1:44:12] was displeased with
[1:44:18] them how many people have been to the
[1:44:20] Sea before I know we are living in
[1:44:22] Minnesota
[1:44:24] those born and Bre in Minnesota if you
[1:44:25] have not gone out maybe the biggest you
[1:44:27] have seen is
[1:44:30] Mississippi now when you go to the
[1:44:33] seashore and you stand at the
[1:44:36] shore and you look at the
[1:44:40] waves those towering waves just coming
[1:44:45] sometimes 5 10 15 20 30 ft high and they
[1:44:49] are coming with full
[1:44:51] force and you will take think that they
[1:44:54] are coming to engulf the land to take
[1:44:56] over the Earth and what do they do they
[1:44:59] just come with all that
[1:45:02] speed and they
[1:45:06] diminish they diminish if you were
[1:45:09] standing at the shore they will just
[1:45:11] diminish those Mountain waves towering
[1:45:14] waves will just diminish under your
[1:45:17] feet praise the
[1:45:20] Lord now God God has set a
[1:45:28] bound the word of God is true the word
[1:45:32] of God is
[1:45:33] sure there is no way you will take the
[1:45:36] word of God and ever be put to
[1:45:39] shame now those Mountain towering waves
[1:45:43] when they are coming I believe sometimes
[1:45:45] they say to themselves Once Upon a Time
[1:45:48] We occupied all this Earth we have been
[1:45:51] here for too long let's go back and
[1:45:55] maybe they are coming with the intention
[1:45:57] of going to take the land but as soon as
[1:45:59] they get to the
[1:46:00] boundary they get checked they say oh
[1:46:06] no the creator has set a boundary here
[1:46:09] we can't go past
[1:46:12] this and they respect that
[1:46:15] boundary they never go past it they
[1:46:18] respect that
[1:46:20] boundary and that is what happens
[1:46:23] when the devil is coming against you
[1:46:26] like those Mountain
[1:46:28] waves if you can only stand still you
[1:46:31] will see the glory of God because he
[1:46:34] knows his place a lot of the times we do
[1:46:37] not know but he knows his place so when
[1:46:40] he's coming with full
[1:46:42] force he just comes and he will diminish
[1:46:45] under your
[1:46:46] feet because that is where the word has
[1:46:49] placed
[1:46:50] him the word says
[1:46:53] a th000 shall fall at their side and
[1:46:56] 10,000 at the right hand side and None
[1:47:00] Shall come near thee that is the word
[1:47:03] that is the promise of
[1:47:05] God they will not come near
[1:47:10] Thee the devil oppress with
[1:47:13] fear if he can just get you to get
[1:47:16] frightened oh I'm in trouble oh waves oh
[1:47:19] the devil is coming he has gotten
[1:47:21] you but if you can just find a
[1:47:25] promise and just stand and call God's
[1:47:29] attention my goodness you are going to
[1:47:33] see the power of God Unleashed in your
[1:47:36] life in the way you never
[1:47:39] expected praise the
[1:47:41] Lord do not fear the
[1:47:44] devil do not fear the
[1:47:46] devil he is under your
[1:47:49] feet I want you to live here today
[1:47:53] knowing that the devil is under your
[1:47:55] feet that that person you thought you I
[1:47:59] mean you were in the ring to to together
[1:48:01] is no
[1:48:03] more he has been
[1:48:05] defeated let not your heart
[1:48:08] fail because of
[1:48:11] him the word has defeated him just take
[1:48:15] the word in all you have to
[1:48:19] do God needs those legs
[1:48:24] he needs those
[1:48:25] legs praise the
[1:48:27] Lord praise
[1:48:49] God uh is 912
[1:48:53] it's 9:12 so I'll be winding down um
[1:48:57] praise the Lord
[1:49:06] um
[1:49:09] yes I want to see where to scale
[1:49:13] down oh praise the
[1:49:15] Lord okay
[1:49:18] so and I want to encourage ourselves
[1:49:21] tonight
[1:49:24] is that God has made a
[1:49:28] promise that he's going to have a
[1:49:31] bride without
[1:49:33] Sport and without
[1:49:37] wrinkle it doesn't matter where you have
[1:49:42] been it doesn't
[1:49:44] matter what you have
[1:49:47] done it doesn't
[1:49:50] matter how many times you have fallen
[1:49:54] it doesn't
[1:49:57] matter what you are going through if you
[1:50:00] can only
[1:50:02] accept
[1:50:04] Christ as your personal Lord and
[1:50:08] Savior if you can only
[1:50:10] truly accept
[1:50:13] him and apply the
[1:50:17] token there is enough Power in the Blood
[1:50:21] to wipe you and wipe every sin wipe
[1:50:24] every iniquity wipe every transgression
[1:50:27] and keep you so clean that when God
[1:50:31] looks down he doesn't see your mistakes
[1:50:33] he doesn't see your sin all he sees is
[1:50:36] the
[1:50:40] blood the
[1:50:42] blood wipes so clean it leaves no
[1:50:48] spot brother brother somewhere said
[1:50:53] that when you are a son of God a child
[1:50:55] I'm not quoting in ver but a Son of God
[1:50:57] or a child of God a daughter of God that
[1:51:00] has been
[1:51:01] redeemed you see a baby a baby that is
[1:51:04] born today you see how innocent they are
[1:51:07] but the brother said when you are born
[1:51:09] again you are more innocent than that
[1:51:16] baby the blood will just puredge you and
[1:51:20] cleanse you and wash you so clean that
[1:51:25] when God looks down he doesn't see them
[1:51:29] whatever you did he doesn't see

[1:56:21] opportunity to get right with God ask
[1:56:24] yourself this life I have been living
[1:56:26] all these
[1:56:28] years has it changed
[1:56:31] me it has either made you
[1:56:34] worse or you are the same place that is
[1:56:37] if you are not living by the
[1:56:40] word but
[1:56:42] today if you are hearing the voice of
[1:56:45] God it is an opportunity to get right
[1:56:48] with
[1:56:50] God there is always wrong in his arms of
[1:56:56] love God would never turn back any child
[1:57:01] of
[1:57:01] his that you get to a place and you
[1:57:04] realize I have made a mistake I have
[1:57:07] messed up have mercy upon my soul you
[1:57:10] come bading the blood there is
[1:57:12] absolutely no way God will turn his back
[1:57:16] on
[1:57:18] you we talk about the love of God we
[1:57:21] barely Scrat
[1:57:22] the surface of Go I mean the love of God
[1:57:25] we barely scratch the
[1:57:33] surface As we sing that
[1:57:36] song that is so white you can't go
[1:57:39] around it the love of God is so high you
[1:57:42] can't go above it it's so low you can't
[1:57:45] go beneath
[1:57:49] it and as the songwriter says
[1:57:56] what is
[1:57:58] it praise the
[1:58:02] Lord that if every
[1:58:06] man was a scribed by
[1:58:11] tray and if every plant on Earth were a
[1:58:17] quill and the sea or the
[1:58:20] ocean ink
[1:58:24] and the
[1:58:25] skies
[1:58:26] parchment if we all set out to write the
[1:58:30] love of God we are going to drain the
[1:58:32] ocean
[1:58:36] dry who can understand the love of
[1:58:40] God therefore God so loved the world you
[1:58:43] and me that he gave his only begotten
[1:58:49] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:58:52] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:58:55] life that God looked on his only
[1:58:58] begotten son in whom he was well placed
[1:59:00] to dwell and they bruised him tortured
[1:59:03] him killed him for you and
[1:59:08] me if you turn him down today tomorrow
[1:59:11] do you think you turn a
[1:59:13] chance the answer is simply
[1:59:18] no praise be to God is difficult I keep
[1:59:22] applying my brakes and I keep sliding
[1:59:25] praise the
[1:59:26] Lord oh praise God so tonight I want you
