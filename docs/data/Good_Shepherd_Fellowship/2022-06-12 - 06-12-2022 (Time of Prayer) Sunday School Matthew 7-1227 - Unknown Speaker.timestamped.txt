[1:24] [Music]
[3:14] judge not that ye be not judged for with
[3:17] what judgment you judge he shall be
[3:18] judged and with what measure ye meet it
[3:20] shall be measured to you again
[3:22] and why beholdest thou the most that is
[3:25] in my brother's eye but considerest not
[3:26] the beam that is in thine own eye
[3:29] or how will thou say to thy brother let
[3:31] me pull out the mote out of thine eye
[3:33] and behold a beam is in thine own eye
[3:36] thou hypocrite first cast out the beam
[3:39] out of thine own eye and then shalt thou
[3:41] see clearly to cast out the moat out of
[3:43] thy brother's eye
[3:46] give not that which is holy unto the
[3:48] dogs neither cast ye your pearls before
[3:51] swine lest they trample them onto their
[3:53] feet and turn again and rend you
[3:57] ask
[3:58] and it shall be given you seek and ye
[4:01] shall find
[4:02] knock
[4:03] and it shall be opened unto you
[4:05] for everyone that asketh receiveth and
[4:08] he that seeketh findeth and to him that
[4:10] knocketh it shall be opened
[4:13] or what man is there of you whom if his
[4:15] son ask bread will he give him a stone
[4:18] or if he ask a fish will he give him a
[4:20] serpent
[4:22] if ye then being evil
[4:25] know how to give good things unto your
[4:26] children how much more shall your father
[4:28] which is in heaven give good things to
[4:30] them that ask him
[4:32] therefore
[4:33] all things whatsoever ye would that men
[4:35] should do to you
[4:37] do ye
[4:38] even so to them
[4:40] for this is the law and the prophets
[4:44] enter ye in at the straight gate
[4:46] for wide is the gate and broad is the
[4:48] way that leadeth to destruction and many
[4:51] there be which go in there at
[4:53] because strait is the gate and narrow is
[4:55] the way which leadeth unto life
[4:58] and few there be that find it
[5:02] beware of false prophets which come to
[5:04] you in sheep's clothing but inwardly
[5:06] they are ravening wolves
[5:08] you shall know them by their fruits
[5:10] do men gather grapes of thorns or figs
[5:12] of thistles
[5:14] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[5:15] good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth
[5:17] forth evil fruit a good tree cannot
[5:20] bring forth evil fruit neither can a
[5:22] corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
[5:24] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[5:26] fruit is hewn down and cast into the
[5:28] fire
[5:29] wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
[5:31] them
[5:33] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[5:35] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[5:37] heaven
[5:38] but he that doeth the will of my father
[5:40] which is in heaven
[5:43] many will say to me in that day lord
[5:45] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[5:48] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[5:50] in thy name done many wonderful works
[5:54] and then will i profess unto them
[5:57] i never knew you
[5:58] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[6:02] therefore whosoever heareth these
[6:04] sayings of mine and doeth them i will
[6:06] liken him unto a wise man which built
[6:09] his house upon a rock
[6:10] and the rain descended and the floods
[6:12] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[6:15] that house
[6:16] and it fell not but it was pounded upon
[6:18] a rock
[6:20] and everyone that heareth these sayings
[6:21] of mine and doeth them not shall be
[6:23] likened unto a foolish man which built
[6:25] his house upon the sand and the rain
[6:27] descended and the floods came and the
[6:29] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[6:31] it fell
[6:33] and great was the fall of it
[6:36] and it came to pass when jesus had ended
[6:39] these sayings the people were astonished
[6:41] at his doctrine
[6:43] for he taught them as one having
[6:45] authority and not as the scribes
[6:50] when he was come down from the mountain
[6:52] great multitudes followed him
[6:54] and behold there came a leper and
[6:55] worshiped him saying lord if thou wilt
[6:58] thou canst make me clean
[7:00] and jesus put forth his hand and touched
[7:02] him saying i will be thou clean
[7:05] and immediately his leprosy was cleansed
[7:08] and jesus saith unto him
[7:10] see thou tell no man
[7:12] but go thy way show thyself to the
[7:14] priest and offer the gift that moses
[7:16] commanded for a testimony unto them
[7:20] and when jesus was entered into
[7:21] capernaum there came unto him a
[7:23] centurion beseeching him and saying lord
[7:26] my servant lieth at home sick of the
[7:28] palsy grievously tormented
[7:30] and jesus saith unto him i will come and
[7:32] heal him
[7:33] the centurion answered and said lord i
[7:36] am not worthy that thou should just come
[7:38] under my roof but speak the word only
[7:40] and my servant shall be healed
[7:42] for i am a man under authority having
[7:44] soldiers under me and i say to this man
[7:46] go and he goeth unto another come and he
[7:49] cometh and to my servant do this and he
[7:51] doeth it
[7:53] when jesus heard it he marveled and said
[7:55] to them that followed
[7:57] verily i say unto you i have not found
[7:59] so great faith no not in israel
[8:02] and i say unto you that many shall come
[8:04] from the east and west and shall sit
[8:07] down with abraham and isaac and jacob in
[8:09] the kingdom of heaven
[8:11] but the children of the kingdom shall be
[8:13] cast out into outer darkness there shall
[8:15] be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[8:18] and jesus said unto the centurion go thy
[8:21] way
[8:22] and as thou hast believed so be it done
[8:24] unto thee
[8:26] and his servant was healed in the
[8:28] selfsame hour
[8:30] and when jesus was come into peter's
[8:32] house he saw his wife's mother laid and
[8:34] sick of a fever and he touched her hand
[8:37] and the fever left her and she arosed
[8:39] and ministered unto them
[8:41] when the even was come they brought unto
[8:43] him many that were possessed with devils
[8:45] and he cast out the spirits with his
[8:47] word and healed all that was sick that
[8:49] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[8:51] by isis the prophet saying himself
[8:54] took our infirmities and bear our
[8:56] sicknesses
[8:59] now when jesus saw great multitudes
[9:00] about him he gave commandment to depart
[9:02] onto the other side
[9:04] and a certain scribe came and said unto
[9:06] him master i will follow thee with the
[9:08] so ever thou goest
[9:10] and jesus saith unto him
[9:12] the foxes have holes and the birds of
[9:14] the air have nests but the son of man
[9:17] hath not where to lay his head
[9:20] and another of his disciples said unto
[9:21] him lord suffer me first to go and bury
[9:24] my father
[9:25] but jesus said unto him follow me and
[9:28] let the dead bury their dead
[9:32] and when he was entered into a ship his
[9:34] disciples followed him and behold there
[9:36] arose a great tempest in the sea in so
[9:38] much that the ship was covered with the
[9:40] waves
[9:41] but he was asleep and his disciples came
[9:43] to him and awoke him saying lord save us
[9:46] we perish and he saith unto them why are
[9:48] ye fearful o ye of little faith
[9:51] then he arose and rebuked the winds and
[9:54] the sea
[9:55] and there was a great calm
[9:57] but the men marveled saying what manner
[10:00] of man is this that even the winds and
[10:03] the sea obey him
[10:05] and when he was come to the other side
[10:07] into the country of the gurgao scenes
[10:08] there met him too possessed with devils
[10:11] coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce
[10:13] so that no man might pass by that way
[10:15] and behold they cried out saying what
[10:17] have we to do with thee jesus thou son
[10:19] of god art thou come hither to torment
[10:21] us before the time
[10:24] and there was a good way off from them
[10:25] and heard of many swine feeding
[10:28] so the devils besought him saying if
[10:31] thou cast us out suffer us to go away
[10:33] into the herd of swine
[10:35] and he said unto them
[10:37] go
[10:38] and when they will come out they went
[10:40] into the herd of swine and behold the
[10:42] whole herd of swine ran violently down a
[10:44] steep place into the sea and perished in
[10:47] the waters
[10:48] and they that kept them fled and went
[10:50] their ways into the city and told
[10:52] everything and what was befallen to the
[10:54] possessed of the devils and behold the
[10:56] whole city came out to meet jesus and
[10:58] when they saw him they besought him that
[11:00] he would depart out of their coasts
[11:03] and he entered into a ship and passed
[11:05] over and came into his own city
[11:08] and behold they brought to him a man
[11:09] sick of the palsy lying on a bed and
[11:11] jesus seeing their faith said unto the
[11:13] sick of the palsy son be of good cheer
[11:16] thy sins be forgiven thee
[11:19] and behold certain of the scribes said
[11:21] within themselves this man blasphemeth
[11:24] and jesus knowing their thoughts said
[11:27] wherefore think ye evil in your hearts
[11:30] for whether is easier to say thy sins be
[11:33] forgiven thee or to say arise and walk
[11:37] but that ye may know that the son of man
[11:39] hath power on earth to forgive sins then
[11:42] sethi to the sick of the palsy
[11:44] arise take up thy bed and go on to thine
[11:47] house
[11:48] and he arose and departed to his house
[11:52] but when the multitude saw it they
[11:54] marveled and glorified god which had
[11:56] given such power unto men
[12:00] and as jesus passed forth from thence he
[12:01] saw a man named matthew sitting at the
[12:03] receipt of custom and he saith unto him
[12:06] follow me
[12:07] and he arose and followed him
[12:10] and it came to pass as jesus sat at meat
[12:13] in the house behold many publicans and
[12:15] sinners came and sat down with him and
[12:17] his disciples and when the pharisees saw
[12:19] it they said unto his disciples why
[12:21] eateth your master with publicans and
[12:24] sinners
[12:25] but when jesus heard that he said unto
[12:27] them they that behold need not a
[12:29] physician but they that are sick
[12:32] but go ye and learn what that meaneth i
[12:35] will have mercy and not sacrifice
[12:38] for i am not come to call the righteous
[12:41] but sinners to repentance
[12:44] then came to him the disciples of john
[12:46] saying
[12:47] why do we in the pharisees fast aft but
[12:50] thy disciples fast not
[12:53] and jesus said unto them can the
[12:55] children of the bride chamber mourn as
[12:57] long as the bridegroom is with them
[12:59] but the days will come when the
[13:00] bridegroom shall be taken from them and
[13:02] then shall they fast
[13:04] no man put a piece of new cloth onto an
[13:06] old garment for that which is put in to
[13:08] fill it up take it from the garment and
[13:10] the rent is made worse
[13:12] neither do men put new wine into old
[13:14] bottles else the bottles break and the
[13:17] wine runneth out and the bottles perish
[13:19] but they put new wine into new bottles
[13:22] and both are preserved
[13:25] while he spake these things unto them
[13:27] behold there came a certain ruler and
[13:29] worshiped him saying my daughter is even
[13:31] now dead but come and lay thy hand upon
[13:34] her and she shall live
[13:36] and jesus arose and followed him and so
[13:39] did his disciples
[13:40] and behold a woman which was diseased
[13:42] with an issue of blood twelve years came
[13:44] behind him and touched the hem of his
[13:47] garment for she said within herself if i
[13:49] may but touch his garment i shall be
[13:51] whole
[13:52] but jesus turned him about and when he
[13:55] saw her he said
[13:56] daughter be of good comfort
[13:59] thy faith hath made thee whole.
[14:02] and the woman was made whole from that
[14:04] hour
[14:06] and when jesus came into the ruler's
[14:07] house and saw the minstrels and the
[14:09] people making a noise he said unto them
[14:12] give place for the maid is not dead but
[14:14] sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn
[14:18] but when the people were put forth he
[14:20] went in and took her by the hand and the
[14:22] maid arose
[14:24] and the fame hereof went abroad into all
[14:27] that land
[14:29] and when jesus departed thence two blind
[14:32] men followed him crying and saying thou
[14:34] son of david have mercy on us
[14:36] and when he was come into the house the
[14:38] blind men came to him and jesus saith
[14:40] unto them
[14:41] believe ye that i am able to do this
[14:44] they said unto him yea lord
[14:47] then touched he their eyes saying
[14:49] according to your faith be it unto you
[14:51] and their eyes were opened
[14:53] and jesus straightly charged them saying
[14:56] see that no man know it
[14:59] but they when they were deported spread
[15:01] abroad his fame in all that country
[15:04] as they went out behold they brought to
[15:06] him a dumb man possessed with the devil
[15:08] and when the devil was cast out the dumb
[15:10] spake and the multitudes marveled saying
[15:13] it was never so seen in israel
[15:16] but the pharisees said
[15:18] he casteth out devils through the prince
[15:21] of the devils
[15:23] and jesus went about all the cities and
[15:25] villages teaching in their synagogues
[15:27] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[15:28] and healing every sickness and every
[15:30] disease among the people
[15:33] but when he saw the multitudes he was
[15:35] moved with compassion on them because
[15:37] they fainted and was scattered abroad
[15:40] their sheep having no shepherd
[15:42] then saith he unto his disciples
[15:45] the harvest truly is plenteous
[15:48] but the laborers are few
[15:50] pray he therefore the lord of the
[15:51] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[15:54] into his harvest
[15:56] and when he had called unto him his
[15:57] twelve disciples he gave them power
[15:59] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[16:02] and to heal all manner of sickness and
[16:04] all manner of disease
[16:06] now the names of the twelve apostles are
[16:08] these
[16:09] the first simon who is called peter and
[16:12] andrew his brother
[16:14] james the son of zebedee and john his
[16:16] brother
[16:17] philip and bartholomew thomas and
[16:20] matthew the publican
[16:21] james the son of alphaeus and libias
[16:24] whose surname was the dias
[16:27] simon the canaanite
[16:29] and judas iscariot who also betrayed him
[16:33] these twelve jesus sent forth and
[16:35] commanded them saying go not into the
[16:37] way of the gentiles and into any city of
[16:39] the samaritans enter ye not
[16:42] but go rather to the lost sheep of the
[16:44] house of israel
[16:46] and as you go preach saying the kingdom
[16:49] of heaven is at hand
[16:51] heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise
[16:54] the dead
[16:55] cast out devils
[16:57] freely ye have received freely give
[17:00] provide neither gold nor silver nor
[17:02] brass in your purses nor script for your
[17:05] journey neither two coats neither shoes
[17:07] nor yet staves
[17:09] for the workman is worthy of his meat
[17:12] and into whatsoever city or town you
[17:13] shall enter inquire who in it is worthy
[17:16] and there abide till ye go thence
[17:18] and when ye come into a house salute it
[17:21] and if the house be worthy let your
[17:23] peace come upon it
[17:24] but if it be not worthy that your peace
[17:26] returned to you
[17:28] and whosoever shall not receive you nor
[17:30] hear your words when ye depart out of
[17:32] that house or city shake off the dust of
[17:34] your feet
[17:35] verily i say unto you it shall be more
[17:37] tolerable for the land of sodom and
[17:39] gomorrah in the day of judgment than for
[17:41] that city
[17:44] behold
[17:45] i send you forth
[17:47] as sheep in the midst of wolves
[17:51] be ye therefore
[17:52] wise as serpents
[17:55] and harmless as doves
[17:58] but beware of men for they will deliver
[18:00] you up to the councils and they will
[18:03] scourge you in their synagogues
[18:05] and you shall be brought before
[18:06] governors and kings for my sake for the
[18:08] testimony against them and the gentiles
[18:11] but when they deliver you up take no
[18:14] thought how or what ye shall speak
[18:18] for it shall be given you in that same
[18:19] hour what ye shall speak for it is not
[18:22] ye that speak but the spirit of your
[18:24] father which speaketh in you
[18:26] and the brother shall deliver up the
[18:28] brother to death
[18:30] and the father the child
[18:32] and the children shall rise up against
[18:34] their parents and cause them to be put
[18:36] to death
[18:37] and ye shall be hated of all men for my
[18:40] name's sake but he that endureth to the
[18:43] end shall be saved
[18:46] but when they persecute you in this city
[18:48] flee ye into another for verily i say
[18:51] unto you
[18:52] ye shall not have gone over the cities
[18:54] of israel till the son of man become
[18:57] the disciple is not above his master nor
[19:00] the servant above his lord
[19:02] it is enough for the disciple that he be
[19:04] as his master and the servant as his
[19:07] lord
[19:08] if they have called the master of the
[19:09] house beelzebub
[19:11] how much more shall they call them of
[19:12] his household
[19:14] fear them not therefore
[19:16] for there is nothing covered that shall
[19:18] not be revealed and hid that shall not
[19:20] be known
[19:21] what i tell you in darkness that speak
[19:24] ye in light and what ye hear in the ear
[19:27] that preachy upon the housetops
[19:30] and fear not them which kill the body
[19:32] but are not able to kill the soul
[19:35] but rather fear him which is able to
[19:37] destroy both soul and body in hell
[19:40] are not two sparrows sold for a farthing
[19:43] and one of them shall not fall on the
[19:45] ground without your father
[19:47] but the very hairs of your head are all
[19:49] numbered
[19:51] fear ye not therefore
[19:53] ye are of more value than many sparrows
[19:57] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[19:58] before men him will i confess also
[20:01] before my father which is in heaven but
[20:03] whosoever shall deny me before men him
[20:05] will i also deny before my father which
[20:07] is in heaven
[20:09] think not that i am come to send peace
[20:11] on earth
[20:13] i came
[20:14] not to send peace
[20:16] but a sword
[20:18] for i am come to set a man at variance
[20:20] against his father and the daughter
[20:22] against her mother and the
[20:23] daughter-in-law against her
[20:24] mother-in-law
[20:26] and a man's foes shall be they of his
[20:28] own household
[20:30] he that loveth father or mother more
[20:32] than me is not worthy of me and he that
[20:34] loveth son or daughter more than me is
[20:36] not worthy of me
[20:38] and he that taketh not his cross and
[20:40] followeth after me is not worthy of me
[20:44] he that findeth his life shall lose it
[20:49] and he that loseth his life for my sake
[20:53] shall find it
[20:55] he that receiveth you
[20:57] receiveth me
[20:58] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[21:01] that sent me
[21:03] he that receiveth the prophet in the
[21:04] name of the prophet shall receive a
[21:06] prophet's reward and he that receiveth a
[21:08] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[21:10] man shall receive a righteous man's
[21:12] reward
[21:14] and whosoever shall give to drink unto
[21:16] one of these little ones a cup of cold
[21:18] water only
[21:20] in the name of a disciple
[21:22] verily i say unto you he shall in no
[21:24] wise lose his reward
[21:29] and it came to pass when jesus had made
[21:31] an end of commanding his twelve
[21:32] disciples he departed thence to teach
[21:34] and to preach in their cities
[21:37] now when john had heard in the prison
[21:39] the works of christ he sent two of his
[21:40] disciples and said unto him art thou he
[21:43] that should come
[21:45] or do we look for another
[21:47] jesus answered and said unto them
[21:49] go and show john again those things
[21:51] which ye do hear and see
[21:53] the blind receive their sight and the
[21:55] lame walk the lepers are cleansed and
[21:57] the deaf hear
[21:59] the dead are raised up and the poor have
[22:01] the gospel preached to them
[22:03] and blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[22:05] offended in me
[22:07] and as they departed jesus began to say
[22:10] unto the multitudes concerning john
[22:12] what went ye out into the wilderness to
[22:15] see
[22:16] a reed shaken with the wind
[22:19] but what went ye out for to see
[22:22] a man clothed in soft raiment
[22:25] behold they that wear soft clothing are
[22:27] in king's houses
[22:29] but what went ye out for to see
[22:31] a prophet
[22:33] yea i say unto you and more than a
[22:35] prophet
[22:36] for this is he of whom it is written
[22:39] behold i send my messenger before thy
[22:41] face which shall prepare thy way before
[22:43] thee
[22:45] verily i say unto you among them that
[22:47] are born of women there hath not risen
[22:49] are greater than john the baptist
[22:52] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[22:54] kingdom of heaven is greater than he
[22:57] and from the days of john the baptist
[22:59] until now the kingdom of heaven
[23:01] suffereth violence and the violent take
[23:04] it by force
[23:05] for all the prophets and the law
[23:06] prophesied until john
[23:09] and if he will receive it
[23:11] this is elias which was for to come
[23:15] he that hath hears to hear let him hear
[23:18] but where unto shall i liken this
[23:20] generation
[23:22] it is like unto children sitting in the
[23:24] markets and calling unto their fellows
[23:26] and saying we have piped unto you and ye
[23:28] have not danced we have mourned unto you
[23:31] and ye have not lamented
[23:34] for john came neither eating nor
[23:35] drinking and they say he half a devil
[23:39] the son of man came eating and drinking
[23:41] and they say behold a man gluttonous and
[23:44] a winebibber a friend of publicans and
[23:46] sinners
[23:48] but wisdom is justified of her children
[23:52] then began to upgrade the cities wherein
[23:54] most of his mighty works were done
[23:55] because they repented not
[23:58] were one to thee corazon woe unto thee
[24:00] bethsaida for if the mighty works which
[24:03] were done in you had been done entire
[24:04] inside them they would have repented
[24:06] long ago in sackcloth and ashes
[24:10] but i say unto you it shall be more
[24:12] tolerable for tyre and zidon at the day
[24:13] of judgement than for you
[24:16] and bow capernaum
[24:19] which art exalted unto heaven
[24:21] shalt be brought down to hell
[24:24] for if the mighty works which have been
[24:25] done in thee had been done in sodom it
[24:28] would have remained until this day but i
[24:30] say unto you that it shall be more
[24:32] tolerable for the land of sodom in the
[24:34] day of judgment than for thee
[24:37] at that time jesus answered and said
[24:40] i thank the o father lord of heaven and
[24:42] earth because thou hast hid these things
[24:43] from the wise and prudent and hast
[24:46] revealed them unto babes
[24:48] even so father
[24:50] for so it seemed good in thy sight
[24:53] all things are delivered unto me of my
[24:55] father
[24:57] and no man knoweth the son but the
[24:59] father
[25:00] neither knoweth any man the father save
[25:03] the son and he to whomsoever the son
[25:05] will reveal him
[25:08] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[25:11] heavy laden
[25:12] and i will give you rest
[25:14] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[25:18] for i am meek and lowly in heart
[25:20] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[25:23] for my yoke is easy
[25:25] and my burden is light
[25:29] at that time jesus went on the sabbath
[25:31] day through the corn and his disciples
[25:33] were in hungary and began to pluck the
[25:35] ears of corn and to eat but when the
[25:37] pharisees saw it they said unto him
[25:39] behold thy disciples do that which is
[25:41] not lawful to do upon the sabbath day
[25:44] but he said unto them
[25:46] have you not read what david did when he
[25:48] wasn't hungry
[25:49] and they that were with him
[25:51] how he entered into the house of god and
[25:52] did eat the show bread which was not
[25:55] lawful for him to eat neither for them
[25:57] which were with him but only for the
[25:58] priests
[26:00] or have you not read in the law how that
[26:02] on the sabbath days the priests in the
[26:04] temple profane the sabbath and are
[26:06] blameless
[26:08] but i say unto you that in this place
[26:11] is one greater than the temple
[26:14] but if he had known what this meanest i
[26:16] will have mercy and not sacrifice
[26:19] he would not have condemned the
[26:21] guiltless
[26:22] for the son of man is lord even of the
[26:25] sabbath day
[26:28] and when he was deported thence he went
[26:30] into their synagogue and behold there
[26:32] was a man which had his hand withered
[26:35] and they asked him saying
[26:36] is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days
[26:39] that they might accuse him
[26:41] and he said unto them
[26:43] what man shall there be among you
[26:46] that shall have one sheep
[26:48] and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
[26:50] day will he not lay hold on it and lift
[26:52] it out
[26:53] how much then is a man better than a
[26:55] sheep
[26:56] wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
[26:59] sabbath days
[27:01] then seth he to the man stretched forth
[27:03] thine hand
[27:05] and he stretched it forth
[27:07] and it was restored whole like as the
[27:09] other
[27:11] then the pharisees went out and held a
[27:12] council against him how they might
[27:14] destroy him
[27:15] but when jesus knew it he withdrew
[27:17] himself from thence and great multitudes
[27:19] followed him and he healed them all and
[27:22] charged them that they should not make
[27:23] him known
[27:55] [Music]
[28:30] [Music]
[29:14] you
