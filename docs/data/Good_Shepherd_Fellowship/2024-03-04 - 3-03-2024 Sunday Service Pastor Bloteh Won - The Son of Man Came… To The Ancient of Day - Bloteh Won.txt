to continue in uh uh what we started Wednesday night and what I want to do this morning as I would trust the Lord to help me I want to take I was I was taking Daniel chapter 9 Daniel chapter 7 uh it's it's only in Daniel chapter 7 that's where the scripture mention the Asian of day it's in Daniel chapter 7 the scripture mention the Asian of day so uh the three times the asent of day was mentioned in the scripture was in Daniel chapter 7 so I want I want to I want to speak on the Asian of day that's where that's why we were speaking on uh uh on Wednesday night but I want to bring this this evening of the asan of day and uh uh I want to bring it and and and explain it in the way of uh of uh the Fulfillment praise the Lord think about this you just think about this uh signs have a BCE so much that when you are walking on the street you have to be careful somebody could be taking your picture and putting it up but you just think about this what would have happened if the news media could have caught the scene of of the angel Gabriel visiting Mary at the well praise the Lord if you if you if you if you realize there you will see that the same angel that spoke to Zacharias you just think about this now the angel appeared to Zacharias in the temple and told Zacharias that he will have a child now Zacharias could have gone out there and tell the people I met an angel some will believe him by the record of his character and some will not believe him praise the Lord you you saw an angel you praise the Lord by the matter of fact you owing me some money you have not PID me then you telling me you saw an angel True Praise the Lord but Zacharias got into a condition where he even uh uh uh surprised him he was he was he was in a doubtful condition so the angel put him in a state and that state that Zacharias will be in will be a Vindication the angel says because you don't believe me you are not going to talk until the child is born now Zachariah comes home he came talk to his wife his wife gets concerned she called the relative Zacharias can't talk he just have to write praise the Lord amen but when the child is born at the naming ceremony of the child Zachariah got his speaking and he says the angel said the child will be called John right in that moment for the fact that El Elizabeth God conceive praise the Lord at her age the testimony of Zacharias is confirmed and right at that moment Zachariah speaking and it's the same Angel but if God who have allowed the the the news media in that day to have captur in your Gabriel Mary will be out of the picture every new news media will want to make money of inel Gabriel they will explore the I mean explore the story they will say things that the angel never said but who would believe this this little girl who would believe her that even he had to take God to send the same Angel gave Joseph a dream and said don't put Merit away and these things are not feeble this very same Earth that you and myself are standing on this morning these things took place on this Earth amen praise the Lord amen and this is not feeble either it's not feeble brother Bram never took this picture right that's right he never took it he he's not the one that wrote this live magazine someone saw the magazine and brought the picture to him amen are we together for where the angel met h h h Mary we need couple of uh thousand with the ticket price now to go to Jerusalem this took place right here in Arizona maybe it will just cost you $100 or so or two praise the lord I can't get on Price Line and get you a cheap ticket I'm trying to say that these are not feebles they are not make up stories am praise the Lord science has not advanced in a way that we have it today where you can take your cell phone and start videoing everybody now a professional photographer you don't need to go to school you just need to get a cell phone praise the Lord if you are me and just like me you don't know how to operate it and I will the even will pass before I remember I have a cell phone oh I I I should have taken that picture it's gone praise the Lord but this Cloud was moving around 610 it was at Northeast of Prescott was moving around 6:15 it was over Phoenix and before 6:30 it went to wins it was visible people were taking the pictures and the guy that wrote this story James mdos he was uh meteorologist trying to you know study uh when people thought that uh this was just a Mist that was that was being created in the heavens he said that a Mist will not be able to sustain its form and move like that praise the Lord that cloud was formed by seven angels yes sir it was formed by seven Angel so we want to we want to be able to uh look at Daniel prophecy and and U uh as we will trust that the Lord will be able to help us um and bless the service this morning praise the Lord let's stand on our feet let's play that song The Cloud of Glory is [Music] moving The Cloud of Glory is mov moving move

and uh let's take our Bible on Wednesday night we read U uh let's go back to that scripture I was going to read from from uh St John that's what I had in my in my PowerPoints but let's read uh uh from uh we read from acts Acts chapter one on Wednesday night let's go back to Acts chapter 1 we'll take that uh for our scripture reading Acts chapter one we read from verse 6 let's read back there again Acts chapter one let's read back there again praise the Lord Brother I thought it was in the plane that uh brother chrisan was going to sing some songs this morning I thought it was I thought he was in the plane well okay okay okay praise the Lord see when you enjoy something you always want to have it okay let's just read now uh from verse six when when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord will D at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is now for you to know the times or the season which the father have put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you amen and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Sam and onto the uttermost parts of the earth and when when he has spoken these things why they beheld and was taken up while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and this happened it wouldn't have been written if the people that saw it never witness it praise the Lord amen the disciples standing right there after Jesus finished speaking you shall be you shall receive power and and you will be my Witnesses Before Their Eyes on my Transfiguration Before Their Eyes Moses and Elijah appear praise the Lord let me tell you or before I continue to read I'm going to do more of the standing up so just bear with me for a few minutes the the the Christian church with the effect of uh Catholicism on the church has taken most of the Bible events as fairy tales and that has taken the effect the seriousness of the word from the hearts of the people that's right people read the Bibles and they just look at the characters in The Bible just like some kind of a cartoon story Tom and Jerry this is not a Tom and Jerry thing this is life and death and God will only be real to us when we put the seriousness of the scripture back in the book and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they Lo steadfast towards heaven as he went up behold two men sto by them in white apparel which also said ye men of gaing was stand here gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye see as ye have seen him go into heaven praise the Lord let's pray together father we want to thank you Lord for this opportunity that you have given us that we can come together as your children to be able to Fellowship around your word to be able to honor the resurrection father that is the key of our faith the resurrection that just as you rose from the dead we will also be quickened to rise from sin and shame we will rise oh god father Lord one day when our body is lying six feet to the grave and there is nothing that is remain of us there's a promise in this book that we will rise again if we remain Lord till your coming will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of one eye father we just so grateful Lord we are so grateful and we just want to ask your blessings now to come and be with us in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord you may have your seat uh uh let me see you okay I think uh I need to change your battery here so uh Emmanuel help me take it back there now so we want to we want to go over to Daniel chapter 7 while they are uh trying to get there ready let's let's run ahead of ourself we don't have much time this morning if uh Daniel chapter 7 Daniel chapter 7 we realize there are the uh like I said earlier it's writing Daniel chapter 7 you will find the the attribute of uh uh Asian of day use praise the Lord and not not many not many uh theologians commented much on the Asian of day much that is said about the Asian of day is just explaining the title you know that uh uh he's the Asian of day praise the Lord when they get it up it will come up now uh uh you know that uh asan of death is the one before time the one before time in season you know trying to bring lot of understanding to the word Asian of day okay I snap my finger just now because I remember that U uh I left out where I took this phrase from we read this on uh Wednesday night the son of man came to the asan of day watch him blend these two together we read that from pmos Vision but I forgot to to put a slide there we have the code back there if you go back to the note from uh a Friday night but uh uh don't go back to it let let's just stay with this I will just read it and then if you want to go and make a search on it uh we we will we can give you what you need so so but the Book of Daniel just like the Book of Revelation what I want for us to understand is that U sometimes you get to the place where you you feel a little bit uh uh afraid and says uh you know is are the people really understanding uh you know what what you are bringing to them is it something but it's the word of God Amen is the word of the Lord praise the Lord and uh uh uh but as we have been saying the Book of Daniel The Book of Daniel what I want you to catch tonight I mean this this uh morning The Book of Daniel holds the mystery of the Jewish Redemption praise the Lord the reason why God gave Daniel this Vision the Sevenfold purpose it was all about the Redemption of Israel praise the Lord amen the Redemption of Israel if we want to go back you will remember that uh H uh uh Joseph just being the young boy he was he was a teenager because he was 17 years old when he was taken to Egypt so before that time Joseph was having dreams toward them is recorded when he dreamed the first time his brothers bowed before him they got angry with him when he told them that dream the second time Joseph would dream it was not only his brothers his mother and father also bow his father said so do you are you trying to say that your mom and this time is not only your brother's now your mom and your and M said we going to Bow before you praise the Lord but what did did not know was that that dream that Joseph had it was prophetic it was about the Jewish Redemption are we together that dream was prophetic so watch this now as as as we will want to look at that together watch this Joseph when he had the dream the first part of the dream will fulfill when Joseph was in Egypt when his brothers came amen are we together the second part of the dream the second dream with his father and mother now watch this now people that are trying to be very critical the second dream Joseph mother and father was supposed to Bow but R shall died she died without even binding down so are we going to call Joseph a false prophet one of the Dream came to pass but there was never a time where his mother and his father bowed down to him praise the Lord but you see these things they are not menade they are not himic fabricated I mean you you just you can't dream dream if God don't give it to you you won't have it praise the Lord and let me even tell you the fact you can't even interpret your dreams you can't interpret your dreams you can't interpret it you can only assume interpretation of dreams and prophecy belong to a prophet that's right I I was thinking about that in the week St uh St is the get the message St is the get brother Brandon had a dream and in that dream he's on the mountain with Jack Mo daughter a teenage girl he's on the mountain with Jack Mo and in the dream he's asking what what is happening what am I doing with this little girl on the mountain as if a a man and a woman is having having a date on the mountain he's he's thinking in his mind am I going to fall praise the Lord and it was just like a man and a woman you know running around and and and uh H H uh uh you know teenage uh H uh a boy and girl hanging hanging out together now he got concerned about it Jack MO is his good friend he's get concerned he's troubled about it he's praying about it he's about to go to Jamaica and the Lord will tell him that the dream that you had about that young girl the church you are going to is a young church and you are going to have a successful Revival you are going to bring that young Church up amen praise the Lord how can you what if it was you what would you think the first thing now you start accusing the girl all of these young girls they just lie lusting after people husand or you you create a whole sermon at the back of the pulpit interpretation of Dreams belongs to a prophet wherever you take your interpretation is you are just assuming that is as far as you can go the second portion of Joseph Dream will fulfill in Revelation 12 a woman in the sun with a moon above her head that is the second portion of Joseph Dream why because it's speaking about the Redemption of Israel it fulfilled the second portion fulfilled but not in the lifetime of Joseph not in the lifetime of his father not in the lifetime of his mother because it was not concerning them it was concerning the Redemption of Israel praise the Lord go home read read Revelation 12 the woman with the son the moon the 12 stars that was what Joseph Dream was the moon the sun and the 12 stars that was what Joseph saw praise the Lord when we can't even keep our mind straight then we want to challenge the word of a prophet then we want to challenge scripture are we together am so you see I say there to say there we have a great Fountain of Truth before Us Praise the Lord for the matter of fact this Bible is the Book of Life there is no there is not one even that is ever on this earth that is not not written in the scripture and I want to challenge you this morning to tell you that this Bible this Bible speaks more about the time we are living in than any time in history that's this Bible yes it speak more about this time that we are living in than any time in history you want to know what a political condition is check the scripture that's why Jesus told the people search the scripture for in them is the Word of Life yes sir not Google or YouTube search the scripture praise the Lord are we together amen am now so uh uh I'm I'm I'm just I'm trying I'm saying you know know trying making all of those emphasis just to get a hold of you this morning I don't want you to sleep on me now so if you look if we look here in our uh uh so we we are speaking on the Asian of day but we are taking the scene here I was going to read this is what I was going to use for my scripture reading uh uh St John chapter 5 22 for the father judgeth no man but have committed all judgment to the son praise the Lord a beautiful type of this can be seen in the in the life of uh uh David and Solomon when before uh David died he called Solomon and he start committing to Solomon you know uh remember shim he spit in my face you know what to do to him remember this one you know David just entrusted all judgment to the son praise the Lord so uh uh uh verse 23 that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honth not the son honth not the Father which sent him praise the Lord now we look at this word s when we in our uh in the beginning series that we've been talking about because if you don't if you don't put on your scriptural cap and you read he honor honoring his son your mind will go back to the son of in Nazareth praise the Lord amen we know that the son in the beginning was when God gave birth to himself when God left being inner because eternity and time can dwell together so the great internal God condensed himself to give a beginning in the beginning was the word the word was with God so the son year is the word praise the Lord the reason why it's important for us to understand that is because when we get back to Daniel and we start talking about the son of man coming to the of day you'll be able to understand it amen verily I said unto you he that heareth my word and Believe on him that sent me praise the Lord have everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is pass from Death onto life now so this scripture right here if you look at the entire setting of the scripture the entire setting here is a judgment setting it's a judgment setting the father has committed all judgment to the son praise the Lord he has committed all judgment what is going to judge us the word is that now what uh uh uh uh Paul said over in Romans chapter 2 verse 16 Paul said you will be judged by Jesus Christ according to my gospel amen he says you be judged according to my gospel what such an authority who was he so we see a setting here we see we we see a judgment setting the father commit all judgment to the son and here Jesus said now if we honor the son if we honor the word take it in the sense of the word now like I said if you honor the word if you if the word have preeminence in your life praise the Lord you are meeting the purpose of the father because the purpose that the father send you here is for the word the purpose for us being here is for the word is for God's word to be manifest in our life that like Jesus would say let men see your good work and glorify your father that is in heaven praise the Lord what uh what an achievement it would be for the father to send us here just for us to live our life do anything that we want to do die and is finished then what is the purpose of his of he making man sure he had a purpose of expressing us sure he had a purpose of bringing us it's not just for us to just live our life anything and then we die to put our six feet on the earth and then is finished are we together now so you can see then that verse 24 now will help us to understand that Jesus is expressing that if you Hearth my word if you receive my word you believe on him that has sent me now believe on him that sent me you have everlasting life and you will not come into condemnation you have passed which mean as you are receiving the word if you are receiving the word that is given to you you are facing your judgment here this morning praise the Lord amen you are passed from death onto life which mean in this life if you use the word of God to judge yourself you are not going to face a judgment lay ahead are we together because what I'm going to talk about this morning is Judgment I'm going into judgment this morning not to make you afraid but just to allow us to be able to see the time that we are in the nations are not going to get better amen I will bring something to you right from the scripture and you're going to see clearly why these things are happening why the word is going in Jesus told the the the the disciple why he was here on Earth you know he told them because uh the Pharisees system the the sindr counsel because they re rejected him he told them what was going to happen to the people you will lack yourself in in the temple you will prayed and you will call on God but Titus the Roman general is going to surround the setting he going to run you over you will eat your children because the the thing about it there is that there is a penalty in rejecting God's word amen praise the Lord now the reason why H I'm I'm I'm making an emphasis for us to be able to get a good setting here is because when you talk about judgment everybody think about the white TR judgment praise the Lord look just like in in the system there is a lower court and there is a supreme court praise the Lord amen amen we receive judgment for things that we do but yet there is a Wier judgment the nation i s received judgment look at Egypt when they when they held God's people and they were enslaving God's people God brought judgment on on Egypt by sending them 10 plagues praise the Lord are we together by sending them 10 plagues God brought judgment on Egypt it looks like it would have been good to bring it to the end but let's go to Romans chapter 1 sorry the team back there I didn't put that in the slide so uh you can either uh just go back and and project that for me let's just look at this together so so uh we can get a get a good setting here as we as we go on see what go uh Paul was telling the church here in Rome Romans chapter 1 let's read verse 16 that's one of the famous verse we all love it for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jews first and to the the Greeks verse 17 for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the J shall live by faith now Verse 18 take this for the wrath of God which is Judgment the wrath of God now listen now Paul is saying the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness now even bring it to ourself holding the truth of the word holding the truth knowing what the word ISS and with that you are entertaining unrighteousness in your body in your mind you are submitting yourself to judgment praise the Lord you are submitting yourself to judgment okay let's let's go ahead here a little bit that is the reason why h h h i mean we have the grace we sank about the seed of forgetfulness last night we have the grace we have the privilege that when we do wrong we have an advocate before the father we must confess our wrong place it under the blood and move on now in it not give our reason justify our why we must continue to do it right are we together because he says here that which may be known of God is manifested in them for God have shown it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being being Hors to by the things that are made even his internal power his godhead so that they without excuse because that when they knew God they glorify him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imagination and their Foolish Heart were dark in professing themselves to be wise they became fools they change the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible men and and birds and and for the Beast and creeping things wherefore God now God wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own heart to dishonor their own body between themsel who change the truth of God to life worshiping and serving the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever for this cause God gave them up into V A affections for even their women they change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the women burning in their lust one towards another men with men working now I I'm reading all of this and where I want to bring you to is that everything that you are seeing around us amen everything you are seeing around us the the the the the the the the drugs movement amen the gun shooting the the the the the LGBT movement all of these things are judgment praise the Lord amen they are judgment when the word is rejected God leaves the people to thems praise the Lord amen you can never show me one happy life without God are we together so all of the things that we seeing around us with the Bible taken out of school biblical principle taken out of the Supreme Court and and all of those things that is happening praise the Lord God is supposed to order our effects he's supposed to order our effects are we together so as I as I bring this to you I'm I'm just trying to help you to see because you you talk about judgment we we we think about final judgment we don't think about the things that are happening around us amen look at when Peter said in the scripture 1 Peter chapter 4:7 he says judgment begin at the house of God what does that mean what it means is that the house of God is the house of correction that what it means how God brings judgment to us to correct us tell us that this thing you are doing is not right this is what I want you to do the house of God is the house of correction are we together okay so so we see you you you we we see this uh uh you know the the the setting here so uh uh I want to go into M uh if uh uh the thing back there can put my slide back up then we can start traveling together we have a little bit of uh uh reading that we want to do here now so let me let me take this don't don't change it let me just take it from uh uh the Friday note and and read it just just to be able to to get us on track now like I said the phrase down here wash him blend these two together it that's what grabed my attention on this on this entire subject of uh uh the son of man came to the Asian of day pmos Vision we read pmos Vision now Daniel 7 like I said just listen to me now don't don't expect it will not go up there I forget I didn't put in my in my slide here I beheld until the Thrones were cast down in the asent of day s whose Gard was white as snowed in his hair like wo that's Daniel 79 that we reading right there and we look in the reading here uh uh uh anybody knows that the old jorges Asian Jorge like like like uh English George used to wear it uh uh they wear a snow white wig how many remember that an Asian George wed a white we because and showing again that John over in the Lost day John on the Allen ofos he saw him as the George not a priest not a king not a prophet but a George the father St John 5:22 commit all judgment to the son now so that's what brother Bram is doing here he's trying to connect these events that are happening you know the father committing all judgment to the son keep that in the back part of your mind because we'll make emphasis on that he says here and he judg now come to judge the Nation Oh for that day when you see him like that his head was as white as snow Daniel saw him coming to the Asian of them watch him blend these two together come to the Asian of day whose hair was white as snow and John when John turned and looked he saw one like the son of man standing in the midst of the seven golden candles stick now so that's where we took this phrase wash him blend the two together praise the lord we read the scripture so these are the three three scriptures you will find the Asian of De mentioning we went over that on Wednesday night verse 9 Daniel chapter 7 I beheld till the Thrones were cast down now watch that and the Asian of day asent of days they s whose garment was white as snow and his head as as as uh and the head of his head as a pure World his was like a fair flame and his wheel as Burning Flame now verse 13 I saw in a night vision and behold one like the son of man came with the Clouds Of Heaven just like Acts chapter one we read and came to the asan of day and they brought him near before him then the tail one until the Asian of day came and and judgment was given to the Saints of the most high and the time came that the Saints possess the kingom so now all of these three verses there are events that are around them and just like I said these are Visions just like when you have your dreams your dreams sometimes don't go in a direct sequence praise the Lord amen is oh I I was I was I was dreaming you know we were we were we were in California when I look I found myself back in Minneapolis praise the Lord you are living in Minneapolis the dream supposed to start from Minneapolis before you go to California that's the normal way you see but it's it does not happen like that so that is the same way yet when you look at these and you really want to put them into scriptural sequence order verse 13 will happen before verse 9 I'll show it to you praise the Lord in the real sequence order verse 13 will happen before verse 9 and then verse 22 where the sins possess the kingdom it's speaking about the Millennium right right are we together now this this is just watch this now that's verse n uh uh verse 9 this is verse 9 I beheld the truns were cast that's verse n and I beheld the TRS were cast that's all the Gentile Kingdom over now this is from the 10 virgin message he's interpreting what this means the the trone were cast Daniel say I beheld and the trone were cast brother bam saying is the ending of the Gentile Kingdom which mean there all the kings at this Throne amen whether it is who in the White House who over there in Russia or North Korea all of their power is finished the Thrones are cast down man ruling is over now see what he was says here in Revelation chapter 4 Series he said now watch Daniel when he saw the throne at the Judgment they were empty okay why because man ruling is over right follow now watch it now he seen the trone cast down come down from heaven the asan of the Asian of time come down from heaven but when John saw it the throne was already occupied by Jesus and the 24 others praise the Lord now Throne is representing the position of ruling are we together now remember now D near hold the mystery of the Jewish Redemption John hold the mystery of the Gentile Redemption praise the Lord but the the the the the the symbols from the both books they run in over there in the book of of Daniel Daniel speaks of the five the the the four Kingdom which are Gentiles Kingdom are we together amen are we together praise the Lord now so we we find ourself here we find ourself here and uh trying to be able to to to help us see the sequence of of the verses that we look at in uh uh in Daniel 9:13 and22 let's stay there a little bit now in uh in down there in nine in verse 99 the truns were cast down and the Asian of day they s now that was what brother Brandon was interpreting year the TR were cast down that was where that was what H uh uh sorry I won't use my finger when I supposed to use the laser the TR were cast down that was what Daniel saw amen the asan of their death SE that was what John saw are we together are you seeing the picture Daniel saw the the The Throne being cast down the end of the Gentile Kingdom and in his vision he saw the Asian of day sitting but John now will bring us that understanding in Revelation chapter 4 with one upon the throne and the 24 others are we together praise the Lord but if you read if you if you look over there in in Dan here if you look over there in Daniel are we together have I lost you are you staying with me am I making you to think too much praise the Lord amen I mean when you when you're trying to teach and you're not a teacher that's what happened amen I'm trying to I'm trying to reduce my emotion this morning I I want to bring the uh the subject to you to make sense so just be with me praise the Lord amen now if you read Daniel chapter 7:9 and you go down to verse 10 he says a fairy stream of issue came forth from before him thousand, Minister unto him and tens of thousand stood before him and the Judgment was set and the books were open now you will realize that you go over in the book of Jude you will see there in verse 14 and verse 15 Jude is telling us that Enoch in his days he had a vision where he saw the Lord coming with 10,000 the very same thing that Daniel is seeing are we together I don't want to lust you I don't I mean if you you give too much information it is just so much we can take the people get lost in the midst of all of the Earth but what I want to establish here is that this this this uh this coming forth of judgment this setting of judgment even Enoch before the to delivering destruction heart of vision of the Lord coming with 10,000 of his sins that is the very same expression that Daniel is using a setting forth of judgment are we together are we together praise the Lord now we're going to get into another phas of it where we will do a little more reading but follow me if I if I if I won't be able to lost you in the in the reading you will you will understand you will understand the Fulfillment of the son of man coming to the Asian of day you will understand the f F me if you just if you just stay with me praise the Lord amen you see because every day every day scripture is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled amen but we we are a privileged people to have a word prophit someone that can set us right in the word praise the Lord and that help us when when events are taking place it help us because the word is Quicken then you remember oh yeah this thing is said in the word I I let me let me let me observe it amen praise the Lord when everything was taking place there in Jerusalem with Hamas I mean every every Bible believer message believer looking at that because Israel is our time piece but uh I mean like I tell people my most concern is the marks of Omar because I'm not supposed to be here when it comes down that M that is sitting in that Holy place where Solomon Temple wants to it will come down by prophecy Jesus said it Daniel also said it the Abomination that causes desolation but I call calling to God's promised word in the sequence of of time the Bride of Jesus Christ will be out of you praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so while we are praying for our loved ones they can stay on the West Bank for now and let all the fighting take place there okay let's let's go here now so I I I want to bring this thing from the message ashame the message ashame brother brandham took the time to be able to to to explain the events he really break it down it's it's one of the place where he really took the time to explain the events of what took place on February 28th and as well as the other events that took place in the nation are we together praise the Lord now follow me I hope I don't lost you I left here by Vision to go y to ton to see what the Lord wanted me to do there he met me up there as I told you year that he would do and the former seven angels now he even said it he explained the vision to the church before before uh uh uh uh this happened before this happened he explained the vision in 1962 sir is this the time and this took place in 1963 now so uh uh uh I'm I'm running out of time I'm also running out of patience as he told me that they would do the form of the seven angels and said return back and the Seven Seals was to be open that's just exactly what happened Lord that will go over your here but let's just read he said one day with brother woles when he come out there he went to a place and threw up a Rock Amen okay it come down he says within a day or night some I forgot just what it was you are going to see the glory of God and the next day a whale wind came down out of the sky and we know the story of what taking place when it came down they asked what was it I said it spoke three words in three great blasts the wh wind came down there was there was there was there was a blast up there on the mountain in in Tucson three great blasts and it says what was that mean what does that mean he said it was three words that he spoke praise the Lord amen the man only heard the blast I understood what it said it said judgment striking West Coast praise the Lord amen you go right in John chapter 12 you see the same thing Jesus was there there was a tunder that Rod there in the heaven the people said what is the tuner all about they only hear the tuner they never heard the voice when God spoke to Moses on the mountain the people said it thundered but Moses heard the voice are we together praise the Lord two days after Alaska like to have sunk it begin tuning around earthquake everywhere just look look at them every day earthquake just shaking everywhere praise the Lord this was in Alaska two day after that blast in ton Alaska had an earthquake why because the message in the blast is that judgment striking the West Coast praise the Lord what is the west coast is not only H uh uh uh as you want to look at it California we are on the west coast because the gospel is supposed to go back to the east right so judgment striking the West Coast it has to do with the Gentile Nations right are we together amen I'm trying to build this picture so I won't leave you with confusion and then two days after Alaska had an earthquake then look at this other statement down here now he says I was preaching in Los Angeles at the bill Mount Auditorium and I was speaking on a man choosing himself a wife choosing of a bride that would be the the message he was preaching amen when uh uh uh uh demon shakaron mother was sick praise the Lord there's a whole story there time for that and while in there something struck me and I didn't know nothing uh uh for about 30 minutes there was a prophecy that went out the first thing I remember brother musle and B I was out on the street walking around and it said thou capani which call yourself by the name of angels that's Los Angeles City of Angels see the Angels which are exalted in heaven will be brought down to Hell for if the mighty Works have been done in Sodom that has been done in you it who have been standing till this day and that was all unconsciously to me and when I understood that I when I said there is a scripture that is about that that is somewhere and and and I went and I found it where Jesus rebuked Capia now so it it was a scripture that was playing in his mind he standing right there in in in Los Angeles bringing bringing a prophecy but in the back part of his mind that prophecy is being compared to a scripture in the Bible because Jesus did the same to the city of capano right are we together Jesus rebuking capania the sea that night I look up the scripture come home got got uh the the history book and sod and gomor a striving City a gentile headquarter of the word in those days the time of lot you know that City by the HH by an earthquake sank into the deep sea there that sod and gomor they got an earthquake that sank them in Jesus time now cap also if Sodom will have worked if if sodon have had the work done in it that that you have done in you it will have been standing today but now you must be brought down to Hell what happened to Sodom it it it it went down in in the dead SE in Jesus's time when he brought judgment on on capania the same thing happened to the city of capan it went under the deep sea wow are we together and about 200 uh two or 300 years after his prophecy like all the coastal town every one of them still standing but capan and it lays be it lays in the bottom of the sea and fqu sunk it into the sea praise the Lord and then prophesying Los Angeles will be in the the botton of the sea right and I come home went to Africa and while I was in Africa you have seen it it was in the broadcast there some big fine uh homes tumble in in Los Angeles the motel and so forth since that earthqu there there is I mean there is a uh two or three in crack that come in uh uh in the form uh that come in the form Earth uh starting from Alaska go around through the the Alton Islands come out about 150 or 200 100 miles in the sea come back up to San Diego take California Los Angeles and come out and and and all of that now I want to show you something I want to show you something Matthew chapter 27 I'm left for a few minutes here praise the Lord those that like ashon pastors you don't have one today there is no action we want to be able to bring this to you praise the Lord amen we can take an inspiration and come and talk about what a mighty God we serve and how God has delivered us and how God is faithful and how God will bring you out of your problem and how God is mindful of you and con you know and concerned about you but it's also our responsibility to be able to show you the Fulfillment of God's word in our day praise the lord it's also our responsibility to be able to put you in the message of the hour right are we together now if you read in Matthew chapter 27 prise praise the Lord Matthew chapter 27 I Tred to find a place to close here Jesus when Jesus was on the cross I spoke about this some time ago and brother brother Wesley brought something to my mind that I did not picture it he made me to go and look at the map and it was it was beautiful I was speaking on under his voice the three things that took place under the voice of Jesus the Bible says he cried with a loud voice and the earthquake there was an earthquake that took place amen the veil in the temple rented from top to bottom right amen and the sins that were dead resurrected those were the three things that took place under his voice praise the Lord you read you read that in Matthew 27 from verse 50 coming down uh let's not take much of the time but you read that there Jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yet of The Ghost and behold the veil in the temple that was the first thing that happened the veil in the temple rented and what did that Veil represent the religious system right praise the Lord amen and it rented from top to bottom amen and there was an earthquake that that that took place after death and TNS from top to bottom and the Earth did Quake the Rocks ran and verse 52 the graves were open and many of the body of the saints that slept in the earth arose that's where Paul testified in the book of Corinthian that uh they were seen for 40 days MH before the Ascension are we together praise the Lord but this is what I want us to see while when we were reading their thing about the cracking of the Earth the earthquake from Alaska brother brandham says it it it it affected the F cross from Alaska all the way down to California I never saw that after the service brother brother I was talking to brother Wesley he told he he said to me he says he said brother one yeah I appreciate the service that you preaching he says but something came to my mind did you wash did you wash the map just like how the veil rented from top to bottom okay and you look at the map Alaska is up California is down true and brother bam says a crack goes in the earth the earth cross has been cracked yeah and you even go and read you go and read about the US uh uh uh uh earthquake you will see you will see the report there the report are all out there of how much uh uh they they are watching that F that they you know that the cracking in the F in the F cross Alaska is always having having its shaking California is always having a shaking right praise the Lord amen are we together okay let me just finish my reading here and then uh I I bring the whole thing to a close here uh let's go back to the slide there and see where we are I should be on the 10th the nth or 10th slide okay thank you oh this is the end that's that's the last one okay okay yeah this is where I was now now now are you following me yeah now he he have already explained he explained going out there on the mountain going out there in tuon word uh uh uh uh brother Banks WS throw the rock up you know the blast took place he said judgment hitting the West Coast he explained that and then he bring all through uh uh the earthquake and all of that that is happening he says then you see the picture the other day I have to I have to skipe most of that he's now referring to this picture now MH M okay he's now referring to this picture he said you see the picture the other day how he turned the picture aside you know the picture this picture was given to brother Brandon somebody printed brought it to the Tabernacle when he was preaching the message uh is the raising of the sun this is how the picture was taken this is the floor this is the picture moving in the cloud and he turned the picture like this right amen turned it to the right he turned it like this he says when you look at the picture you will see his eyes praise the Lord so that's what he's referring to there see the picture the other day how he turned the picture turn that picture sideway there and the Very picture of those seven angels being lifted up turned it to the right hand side and there is the face of the Lord Jesus Christ looking down to the Earth again amen praise the Lord are we together I'm trying to walk you through prophecy you remember when I preach the seven Church ages I couldn't understand why Jesus standing there with a white wig over his head he was a young man I took it back back in the Bible right it said he come to the Asian of day Asian of days whose head was white as wood now so you see what is he doing he's connecting the vision he's connecting this happening with Revelation chapter 1 yes sir praise the Lord if you think that is not the Fulfillment as a Christian go and look for the Fulfillment because it's your responsibility right are we together praise the Lord are you are you grapping the picture yes so he's con he's now connecting the the the the event that took place now bringing it down he say you remember I preach I was thinking he even had a had a talk with Jack Maul and said and said Jack Mo what what does this mean he said you are a scholar you are a Bible scholar what does this Revelation chapter 1 mean with Jesus in the in in with with uh you know his hair white as W Jack Mo says that is Jesus in his glorified body brother Bram says that does not ring bell to me because this because Revelation is the continuation of the ministry of Jesus Christ how is he Contin continuing his ministry on Earth in a glorified body that's right praise the Lord are we together don't worry I'm I'm about on my last quot here thank God you didn't sleep on me you remember I preached he says I couldn't understand why Jesus standing there over with a white Weg I took it back to the Bible it said he come to the asan of the w w wo's head as as white as walk Jesus was only 33 and A2 years old at crucification I went up there and and I I started on the first church age there the Holy Spirit reveal it now you got it right on the church age I guess the book will be out pretty soon I have some some back there if you want a copy I give it to you the full detail and and it show that Jesus was judged amen sorry of myself there is the white week that they use to word put a Weg on and wear it as a Jorge uh uh England still does does it when you when you got supreme authority so so the white rig was representing supreme authority praise the Lord amen supreme authority now let me give you a picture let me read this and then I I try to put it in in in an image form for you for for you to see it and that's turning turning H sway in this picture The sueme Authority now he says that is turning side when you turn the picture sideways he's wearing the white weak that's how you say if you turn the sideway that is turning the picture turning sideway in this picture there he is his black head you can see you can see it in in in the side of his beard and in the white wheat on he he is the last of all authority he is the supreme authority even God says so himself this is my beloved Son yeah yeah him that was man's Transfiguration Jesus was also in a glory he had that while we are now what is it is that uh H H uh uh he's coming to a form now because we realize in Revelation chapter one he's not in a physical body right he's not in a Corporal body but he's still dwelling in his church in what form the form of the word the word is the supreme authority that's the reason why nothing is above the word of God in the local church amen the doctor order is not above the word the economy is not above the word praise the Lord amen even your struggle is not above the word this is the supreme authority you're supposed to look in this word and find out what the word says about you so Jesus back in his church he's not in a physical body he take the form of his word in the beginning was the word the word was with God everything was made by him yes and without him nothing was made that very same word that spoke this entire universe into existence is not in your midst Hallelujah am praise the Lord that's why it's all about that's what that picture out there is all about it's about the supreme authority of God's word that whatever God spoke amen hallelujah there is no power that's going to stop his word if he said he's going to get a bride this word is able to produce a bride if he said he's going to get a church this word is able to produce it we don't need form we don't need your him of suggestion let's go back to the word you do what the word says let me do what the word says the word will produce its Church am amen hallelujah that's what it is brother said Jesus make it so simple that we don't need to have a mega church he said wheresoever two or three I gather in my name if you take my word I will be there I just need two or three that will take me by my word he said you will see me being manifested in your midst you don't need to make programs and and and and all sorts of things to to be able to recruit people to church Let's Take God by his word the seriousness of God's word amen and let's see if God will not back it up am praise the Lord you know the thing about it I I'll try to close right here he knows the beginning and the end amen he knows all things nothing takes him by surprise as we always say it amen nothing take God by surprise hallelujah amen I I don't know where I fin kicking that thing somewhere oh sorry about the pop okay thank you thank you thank you praise the Lord I I I I really started preaching now all this why I've been talking there he is with them Angels the message what we call the message praise the Lord that's it it's not a church making people amen since the church was born on the day of Pentecost the Bible says two men stood in white apparel spoke to the disciples and said the way you see him going the way you will come Angelic experience had never left the church who took people from praison it was an angel praise the Lord who met Paul on the road of damasco it was an angel praise the Lord Angelic Association has never left the church yes sir are we together amen there he is with those angels the message which was the seven breaking of them Seven Seals that's that reveal sepen SE that make us to understand what the sepen SE is and all these things it shows that it is his very covering his supreme authority has been stemed on the word praise the Lord amen not just only to give us a message to make us excited in the in in the mystery of the godhead the serpent SE and all of that no but that supreme authority is here to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that Jesus that met the the the the woman at the well and told her the things about her life praise the Lord break her out of her shame and her complex and she could run into the City and say come and see the man that same Jesus is here and if you meet him you will have the same experience you will not be ashamed of your failures because there's a God that can change your failures unless you want to make your failure your identity that's not your identity wow that's what the message of the hour is Glory that's the supreme authority we can stand on that word and say he's the same yesterday today and forever are we together all the F about February 28 he was there he was not it does not matter right praise the Lord it does not matter you know why because because when the Supreme judge amen when the Supreme judge he may not even show up to court but when he sent his order amen amen praise the lord we trying to make this thing a first about it's not will brandham it's what God has promised to do they have nothing to do with William brandham is dead he's gone he's behind the curtain of time he have done his life work amen amen now you and myself now let's start arguing about this man it is our time to pick up this word let's find ourself in the scripture praise the Lord that's what it's about that's the supreme authority amen that's what those clouds are about that's what Daniel 7 the asan of day the son of man com to the asan of the asan of Day represent that PR Authority there had to be a Ministry on Earth yes sir that's right that brings the church to that place the father judged no man but he have committed all judgment to the son which is the word amen the preaching of the word judg us if you accept the word praise the Lord and do what the word says you should do then you have passed your judgment but those that will spend all of their time arguing against the word why the Bible says it why the Bible says it why the Bible says this and and just and just trying to make FSE and make an argument praise the Lord why should it concern you whether it was it a real fish that Jonah was in Jonah was really was he really in the what should that concern you amen I'm trying to say why make an argument about it forget about the fish see what happened to Jonah after the fish he went to a city brought a message the only time in history that an entire nation came under a conviction of a Preacher was Jonah why should we spend time on whether it was a big fish it was a will it was a special fish God buil the fish why should we spend time on that and don't get to thinking that God could use a man to bring a word to bring conviction to our entire head it praise the Lord I might not bring a a conviction to the entire broklyn Center but God can use me to have one person if I could be concerned about thaten Lord I'm not like Jonah I might not be able to bring but Lord I believe you can use me just to bring one person to be a witness amen amen amen amen because I believe your word is truth am I not be able to explain the Bible verse and talk about this but somebody can look at my life and say I knew you I know what she was I know who he was yes sir this is not the same person my my my we spend our time on I gearing and trying to prove this and trying to prove that those men of history they have done their working gone right this is your day what are you doing for God even in your own life so say God I know you went to the cross of Calvary you die for my sin you pay the price I'm having this habit that is bothering me praise the Lord I want to charge it to the price that was paid if the price was paid for sin it was also paid for this thing in my [Music] amen then you taking the word of God serious it's not for us to be arguing over scripture what benefit is going to be what what Moses and and and they did their part it's written for our edification that just as God used them God can use us in our later ways but let's take the word do something with the word of God in your life in your home yeah amen that's what we are talking about because the Supreme judge have already stepped down one foot on the land and one fo on the sea amen and he raised his hand to heaven and he swore by himself that everything that he has spok him will come to pass praise the Lord and and and if there is one that is ready to take God at his word you will see God in your life you ready to play you go ahead play than you play your church play your religion yes one of these days you will realize that none of those things matter that's what it's all about people

far gone thank you for bearing with me but I hope you got the picture amen I hope you got the picture you you take you take this very seene over to Malachi 4 and you start you start seeing how John I mean the prophet Malachi talk about the DAT of the Lord and and all of that we were supposed to go into that but I just I just thought that maybe we do that another time I don't want to make this another long Series so I just uh wanted to bring it just like I told you Wednesday night I was up Wednesday morning at 4 a.m. in the morning I came down sitting down there and just meditating praying and I'm saying to myself I said Lord this is February 28th there was a great event that took place on the earth praise the Lord amen we don't have time but I could show that to you Peter when Peter wrote his book and he talk about we are eyewitnesses we are not following coing devis feeble go and search for that in the book of Peter you know what Peter was referring to being an eyewitness he was referring to man's Transfiguration experience that what happened on my Transfiguration we were there we saw it with our eyes praise the Lord amen the newspaper never carried you will never find it in no history book of that time but there were three men that were on my Transfiguration and they saw it with their eyes Peter said we're not following coing devis fever we are eyewitnesses and I was just sitting down there that morning if you remember Wednesday night the few I share with you I was saying Lord how I will have love to be in Phoenix Arizona or Tucson to see the moving of the cloud how I would have loved it but you never allow me to be born in that time but yet you have given me Grace you have given me Grace that even though that was not there I believed the report amen praise the [Music] Lord how I will have love to be there to to be right there and see my Lord hanging on the cross how I will have love to see him hanging on the cross for my hands look at him and just weep but even if you were theread that day if God didn't now move your heart to believe that that is the savior of the word you will be among the bunch that were saying crucify him even if you were there that then if God did not move your heart to believe that this is the man that is dying for the sin of the word you cannot be a middle person you will either be on one side or the other you are either on the side of the ones that believe or on the side of the ones that that that that are that are criticizing the word because there were two group of people that day there were one that was saying what have he done history history recorded that Mary Magdalene she was crying what have he done he only Open the Eyes of your blind he healed your sake she was shouting all over the place when there were millions of people that were standing there and saying crucify him crucify [Music] him and our attitude to the word of God will be the same what are you doing about this word what are you doing
