[1:52] foreign
[1:55] [Music]
[2:38] thank you
[2:45] [Music]
[3:13] so without any further hesitation of me
[3:16] I'm just going to turn the over again
[3:22] [Music]
[3:32] I just like to make an announcement man
[3:34] let me study here if you think of them
[3:40] yeah
[3:44] I certainly enjoyed being here every
[3:48] time our journey is getting close to the
[3:51] end now of us staying with you because
[3:53] we got another meeting coming up right
[3:55] away in Chicago and I've got to have
[3:57] this
[3:58] um the family back in Arizona pretty
[4:00] soon and um they've never had their
[4:03] Summer's vacation yet and I'm supposed
[4:05] to take them for a little ride somewhere
[4:08] in a few days and then I'll probably be
[4:12] a wave one one day one of the Sundays
[4:15] and then the following week off again in
[4:17] Chicago then I got to come right
[4:18] straight back on a Monday and take them
[4:21] to Arizona
[4:22] and now uh I just think to come in of a
[4:26] Sunday morning take that a time where
[4:29] everybody's refreshed Sunday night
[4:30] you're always tired and wore out on
[4:33] Sunday night and turn the Sunday night
[4:35] service over to our pastor that's uh
[4:37] that's a very high band but um I hate to
[4:41] do that so yes on Sunday night I would
[4:44] um
[4:44] uh Sunday night to have a service Sunday
[4:47] night and a hold of people so late many
[4:49] of them come in here from way down in
[4:52] the South and and Way North and they
[4:54] have all sometimes to drive day and
[4:56] night just to get here for one service
[4:58] then go back and that's the reason I try
[5:00] to make it on Sunday morning when I come
[5:02] give them a chance to go back
[5:05] loyal faithful pilgrims amen I
[5:09] appreciate him the drive-through sleet
[5:11] rain and everything else to get here
[5:13] across the country hundreds of miles
[5:15] just for one little circle
[5:18] so uh it makes me feel grateful to God
[5:21] and to these people or their great for
[5:25] their great support and what I'm trying
[5:27] to tell to the people to be the truth
[5:30] and I believe this is the truth yeah all
[5:34] my heart if there was anything different
[5:36] that I thought was better I'd certainly
[5:39] first go I won't ask anybody to go
[5:42] anywhere last don't go first to find out
[5:44] what it's right enough I will ask any
[5:47] person who says
[5:49] in God that I had no name and know
[5:51] that's the truth first it must be the
[5:53] word of the Lord then I'm a step and see
[5:55] if it's right and then at the tripod I
[5:58] ain't say come on up this way see it's
[6:00] making the way
[6:05] he's supposed to be a leader a leader of
[6:09] people not speak something if he would
[6:11] put his hand on himself
[6:13] we should go into the leaders of other
[6:14] people
[6:16] this morning
[6:17] I had a very odd peculiar experience
[6:21] Here In a Pulpit and that was about uh
[6:25] the last part of the message I wasn't
[6:27] aiming to say it that way but uh I guess
[6:31] it's already said there's nothing I can
[6:33] do about it now but then I got home got
[6:36] studying about it and had a little
[6:37] family reunion today of just my brother
[6:40] and them mama's gone and we used to meet
[6:43] at her house and now it would go up to
[6:45] Dolores
[6:46] we had a nice time up there this
[6:49] afternoon and talking and said he was
[6:51] long we sang some songs played some
[6:53] hymns and names now
[6:56] I think maybe
[6:58] uh next Sunday morning if the Lord is
[7:01] willing if the brother never would also
[7:04] I'd like to have a heating service just
[7:07] just dedicated only to Healing yes and
[7:10] um I think with the message this morning
[7:13] the ways the Lord seemed to leave me to
[7:15] bring it bring it out also the Italian
[7:18] courageous so to conceit it's a I really
[7:22] believed we are we play around and we we
[7:26] take different things and talk about
[7:28] them but then when it comes to Showdown
[7:30] that's something different as the
[7:34] [Music]
[7:36] telling I believe it was my brother back
[7:37] there telling a little story today about
[7:40] a man a minister and his son that one of
[7:45] his congregations he said he could walk
[7:47] along he said pastor sure the Lord's
[7:49] with you he said I can pack them all
[7:51] over across my back when I go across and
[7:53] share the Lords with you and he went and
[7:55] done he said I can pack along wheel a
[7:57] wheelbar across the same time sure
[7:59] Pastor Lords with your faith can do
[8:01] anything he said I can put you in the
[8:03] Wheel bar and pack the log he said wait
[8:05] a minute
[8:06] it's different when you're including it
[8:09] yourself
[8:10] now that's it's my good first to say
[8:13] here amen It's mighty good for us to say
[8:16] I believe that's true but then put it in
[8:18] action that's right is that put an
[8:21] action
[8:22] as a brought that statement this morning
[8:24] the people is laying in the shadow of
[8:26] Peter they never even asked for prayer
[8:30] I've went into many homes watching this
[8:32] pray before goal he's going there with
[8:34] an awning and don't even praise the
[8:36] people walk out in their heels amen amen
[8:39] I've seen it done so many times see
[8:41] you've got to have somewhere to place
[8:43] your faith
[8:45] yeah you got to believe it and um I
[8:48] believe it's in our
[8:50] approaching and now he is
[8:52] I realized that this was not a tate
[8:55] service they might make a little one for
[8:56] themselves but this is not a tape that
[8:59] goes out across the
[9:02] uh the this one I was speaking of this
[9:04] morning has brought us right up to
[9:07] Climax and that's reason I'm going to
[9:09] take next Sunday for uh uh a healing
[9:13] service
[9:14] because the sense of in home I've told
[9:16] you about divisions and what happened
[9:18] and everything and brought it up why
[9:20] I've done all these things and then this
[9:23] morning bring it right up now to that
[9:24] last Pokemon
[9:26] now
[9:28] it's my time for consecrations of God
[9:30] God's time to speak to me I I must just
[9:34] have a little change in my own life
[9:38] that are not as I think that I'm wicked
[9:40] but I want to feel a little more closer
[9:43] to people see the people that I have
[9:46] tried to tell the this gospel truth to
[9:49] and they turn their back on walkway and
[9:50] laugh at it now
[9:52] that seems like it's an insult I don't
[9:55] care to me but to the things that I've
[9:57] been saying it's a true trying to help
[9:59] them like shoving out a boat and say
[10:00] here here just cross over here get out
[10:02] of that swelling stream you're going to
[10:04] die you're going to Parry said and
[10:06] they're just laugh at you and walk away
[10:07] well to me it feels like if they walk
[10:09] away there's nothing more I can do about
[10:11] it see that I can do but I want to run
[10:14] down the bank now and persuade him to
[10:15] come on back yeah
[10:17] vehicle I know there's somebody out
[10:20] there that hasn't come in yet and I'm
[10:22] going to fish tell us uh he says a nice
[10:26] fish is called
[10:29] now
[10:31] and now in order to do this I'm
[10:34] expecting there's something to happen in
[10:37] a prayer meeting
[10:38] something and many of you remember the
[10:40] vision of the of the last full full
[10:43] third full rather you remember there was
[10:46] something happened just before that I've
[10:48] seen that light come and go down into
[10:51] that place instead of I'll meet you
[10:52] there
[10:54] uh I'm looking for something to happen
[10:57] you're years ago it used to be that the
[11:00] services and that discernment that make
[11:02] me so we God stagger many of you
[11:04] remember that this gets a spot that's
[11:06] standing up had Jack Moore on one arm
[11:08] and brother Brown on the other and
[11:09] brought me up down the street per hour
[11:10] after service and I just had trying to
[11:13] think of where where I was at and what
[11:15] was taking place and then all night lay
[11:17] there and think of it and stop and
[11:19] everything else and more quality this
[11:21] accept our lord Jesus then he told me
[11:24] the vision one time you'll meet a lady
[11:26] that will come to you wearing a brown a
[11:30] suit and she'll be packing little baby
[11:32] in a blanket and from that time on
[11:34] you'll have strength to endure stronger
[11:37] well I told you all that and in Chicago
[11:40] it happened that night with a little
[11:42] Presbyterian lady went her own Pastor
[11:45] centered out with a baby I believe it
[11:47] was his brother or one of them was a
[11:49] doctor he said there's not a hope for
[11:51] the baby unless almighty God touches and
[11:54] he went she went and told her pastor her
[11:56] Pastor said I am I I'm not uh qualified
[12:01] he said to to act upon this Divine
[12:05] Healing because I I don't just don't
[12:07] have it within me the faith that it
[12:09] takes to do it now that's
[12:11] awesome he said I don't I just have it
[12:15] in me he said but I was at one of
[12:18] Brothers meeting and I advise you to
[12:20] take the baby to brother Brandon and the
[12:22] doctor give it up it was going to die
[12:25] and the little lady walked in there
[12:27] where I was having a some sort of a
[12:29] service for them little catholic
[12:32] children that got burnt up in that
[12:34] school up there you know you remember
[12:35] when it was was that in that service and
[12:37] coming right down the platform comes
[12:40] that little lady with the brown suit on
[12:41] my wife and M was sitting there and I
[12:45] said turn and look look all around
[12:48] theater stand there and happen to be
[12:50] that just before come up I'll be Billy
[12:52] Paul and them have been talking to her
[12:54] wife or some of them to the lady with
[12:55] the little baby and the lady walked up
[12:58] to the platform the Holy Spirit revealed
[13:00] the whole thing and heal the baby to
[13:01] death of Walter he said saying I just
[13:04] don't get power see it don't bother me I
[13:07] just go right on and on now I'm looking
[13:09] for something to happen to start that
[13:11] third pull in the March and uh May the
[13:15] next Sunday morning healing service
[13:16] maybe produce that I don't know amen I
[13:19] think for eign
[13:21] [Music]
[13:24] service we got
[13:27] we got sick people
[13:28] get your sick people get them here early
[13:30] next Sunday morning say about eight or
[13:32] eight thirty and uh we'll give them a
[13:35] prayer card as they come in the door
[13:36] however they do it and then we'll have a
[13:40] prayer line and pray for the sick and
[13:42] you see what the holy spirit will do I
[13:43] believe he'll do wonders if we'll just
[13:45] believe it amen but we got to believe
[13:47] him for that now with all of our hearts
[13:50] and I think that the great power has
[13:53] arrived that when God in so much as
[13:56] we're speaking this morning has showed
[13:58] us so much
[14:00] and brought us to a certain just after a
[14:02] spot just to push over that little Hill
[14:04] and that's all you need and then away it
[14:06] goes uh are going just like it was the
[14:09] same thing with the discernment same
[14:11] thing by the
[14:13] father to watch I stand in Calgary I beg
[14:16] your pardon
[14:18] uh it was the Queen City down in
[14:21] retirement Regina and Aaron Baxter was
[14:24] standing there and a bunch of us and the
[14:26] told me right through the platform
[14:28] that'll come to fashion and all the very
[14:30] secret of their heart and that's right
[14:32] not every thought of that in that manner
[14:34] I walked up the platform that night with
[14:36] her and it started praying for the sick
[14:38] and here come a man along you just laid
[14:41] out his entire life
[14:43] first time it ever happened just like
[14:45] that in a moment in a healing Circle and
[14:48] then I looked out all the audience and
[14:49] hear it began to come down over the
[14:50] orange and they or when we reached the
[14:53] other side the half has never yet been
[14:55] told other things to watch out and see
[14:57] things in people's lives I don't say
[14:59] anything about it just let it alone see
[15:00] unless I'm really compelled to say
[15:04] and I look for this next to start like
[15:06] that see God in his own way his own
[15:09] Sovereign time to begin and it'll it'll
[15:12] be a another thing that'll be to be a
[15:15] Way Beyond any of these other things and
[15:18] I'm I'm looking for that to happen and
[15:20] maybe I thought if I'd had a little
[15:22] healing service maybe next Sunday and
[15:24] then the following Sunday I'll probably
[15:25] be away with the kids and them because
[15:27] they got to go back and go to school and
[15:29] then the next Sunday of course I'm up in
[15:31] Chicago at the meeting up there and then
[15:34] come back the following Monday to leave
[15:36] on Tuesday for for Arizona for the kids
[15:39] yeah thank you yeah well what'd you find
[15:42] pastor

[15:46] strong good that's very fine now we want
[15:48] to hear about it so now the Lord bless
[15:51] you all real real good and uh hope to
[15:55] see you here next Sunday and Wednesday
[15:56] night and listen don't forget

[16:22] this little follow-up back here brother
[16:24] I made the other night over there Allen

[16:33] know him they're both Methodist
[16:35] ministers and has seen a truth of word
[16:40] which the the ark organization of the
[16:42] Methodist Church which is a fine bunch
[16:44] of people in that Methodist Church but
[16:46] you never think they're not they are
[16:47] there's a fine bunch of people at
[16:49] Catholic Church to find a bunch of the
[16:51] Presbyterian churches and all those
[16:53] places that it's man and women that are
[16:56] waiting to see that light flash over
[16:58] their path and just keep flashing a
[17:00] light in humility

[17:06] humbling ourselves yes help us don't
[17:08] forget this Tabernacle will lose extreme
[17:11] remember that this is a target where
[17:14] Satan's got every gun in Hell trained on

[17:19] it's contrary want the other things
[17:21] he's doing that he's up to it that's his
[17:23] business if he can get somebody to say

[17:54] we're headed towards the setting others
[17:56] the Lord Jesus will be coming one of
[17:58] these days and you all you know I think
[18:01] it'll be so sad and so so sweet so uh
[18:05] there'll be 100 100 the 100 percent of
[18:09] the whole world will never know when
[18:11] that Badger takes place
[18:16] quietly that nobody no other than that
[18:18] Jesus and there'll be of course the
[18:21] little groups will say voila so and so

[18:25] a group left from over there and that's
[18:28] not so they just gone out somewhere

[18:35] was so many of them members that's
[18:36] missing see they just play that out
[18:39] there say oh there's nothing to that you
[18:40] see I guess it'll be passed and they
[18:43] won't know it
[18:44] Across the Nation will come those who
[18:47] are dead in Christ will rise first
[18:49] the ranch will take place the church
[18:51] will be taken home and then the
[18:53] tribulation will set in and hold my we
[18:57] don't want to be here during that time
[18:59] I don't want to be here in the triple
[19:02] no God forbid that any of us should ever
[19:05] be here during that time because he
[19:07] that's filthy is filthy still he that's
[19:10] holy is Holyfield you that's righteous

[19:17] redemption and the bride has been taken
[19:20] out those who turned it down has to go
[19:22] through a tribulation period both Jew
[19:24] and Gentile what a time of tribulation I
[19:27] don't want that Lord sanctify me now

[20:33] if we would slip up theirs on Thursday
[20:35] night and show those fellas a little
[20:37] Fellowship see
[20:40] [Music]
[20:46] don't stop just like when Elijah told
[20:49] him said dig ditches out there
[20:52] if you get down you hit an old tin can
[20:54] say I'm too tired throw it away
[21:02] if you if you expect to miss the
[21:04] tribulation you better start digging now
[21:07] for myself I'm preaching to myself there
[21:10] I'm going to start digging deeper than I
[21:14] ever know uh for because I feel like
[21:16] that in the nation and around the world
[21:19] that this ministry will again as it's
[21:24] known Now by everywhere over the world
[21:29] wife said to me every morning I said
[21:31] will she go with me when I leave I'm
[21:33] gonna leave around January the Lord
[21:35] willing I want to take a complete world
[21:38] too all the way around and I come back
[21:40] and May
[21:41] have services in the United States
[21:44] sometime next summer and she said I'm
[21:47] too old to go
[21:49] well I said I went when I about my last
[21:52] trip overseas about eight years ago and
[21:54] I feel like I'm in better shape now than
[21:56] it was eight years ago
[21:58] I know more about it now then we got on
[22:01] the subject if the Lord said I'm going
[22:03] to lock you 25 years you're not going to
[22:05] get people you'll be able to go and I'm
[22:07] gonna launch you 25 years on Earth would
[22:09] you take from from birth to 25 or from
[22:12] 25 to 50 50 to 75 or 75 200. now any man
[22:17] that's not at any time on Earth will
[22:19] certainly if you do a most rational
[22:21] thing if you don't spend that time in
[22:22] service of God I don't care what he does
[22:24] Amen if you're going to be a heartbreak
[22:27] for the women so forth you better take
[22:30] that young age that first 25
