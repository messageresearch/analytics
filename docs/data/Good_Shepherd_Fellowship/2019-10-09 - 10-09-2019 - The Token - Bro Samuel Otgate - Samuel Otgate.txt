great day of the rapture amen yeah we be like then we do say I was happy when they said that to me let's go to the house all alone yeah because he knew there was something every time he went the help of the Lord there was something that God would add in him and would never be the same amen so may God bless you I mean I think all of you should be knowing me I believe the person who introduced me but I can again introduce myself I'm corporal Samuel what I get from Uganda amen I think I was real lastly I think almost aloud this time again and it's our God that we are together again I hope no no one went in the rapture before others all of us as a men so I just want to invite to attention to the book of Exodus chapter 12 and then before we read can we just warheads what a lot of Prayer our might have any father we deem this a grand privilege to be gathered again in the place that is called by thy name Lord you said where there are two or three gather together in your name you will be there in their mid esteem may you know father calm down and be amongst your children Lord speak to us father encourages no one Lord we know the heavens and earth shall pass away but the world shall never pass away they what is it tunnel in Lord we know when you receive that one we also become eternal Lord take me out of the way I'm just a human being just a vessel father my lord when you come down for the Lord you take preeminence and Lord speak to us in your own way Lord God you are the high priest but touched by the feelings of our infirmities Lord you know every need of ours you know every weakness you know every failure Lord you know our Father we are to lift us up Lord and now we have to bring us down Lord we need you King of glory father there are many who have been able to come because of different problems and situations but Lord I commit all of them to our hands when you know father have your own way upon each one of us Lord Thank You King of glory bless Lord the paths of this church but as the because the trustees bless every member our Lord may anointing of the Holy Spirit lead a through King of glory as we are marching on even to the rapture thank you loving master house it covered only things to you believing every day granted to us in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen I guess won't read from the book of Exodus chapter 12 and as I said we may not take long I mean I have many of course that I may not quote all I may put some the way this people lead us amen amen Exodus chapter 12 from was stroll he says so I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and all I mean and again as all the gods of Egypt I'll extrude judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses we are we are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and also you can have the book of Hebrews chapter 9 I'm shocked at another chapter 10 of Hebrews and from verse 19 a man having therefore brethren boldness to enter in the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say in flesh in having an High Priest on the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works maybe Caribbean five also not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching may the Lord bless earning of his one we can just be seated for a while amen I just want to speak on something small and call it when I see the blood I'll pass over you the Prophet preached evita same day talking when he said we have to apply the token and then he said some we're not talking could not be applied but it was to be applied only in the evening time amen and we know we are now in the evening time when the token is to be applied amen and then when you talk when you talk about a token we are talking about the blood amen because the blood was applied in the evening time in the time of Moses he also we have read in the Bible the book of Exodus the blood was applied in the evening time amen amen so in the Old Testament we find that the blood was a sign of a Convenant or agreement between man and God amen so whenever there was anything that God wanted to agree with you man he had to use blood amen maybe if we read the book of Exodus let us really a book of Exodus chapter 20 for excellence trained for so it was a covenant anything that God wanted to do with man wanted to agree with man he wanted to save man wanted to deliver man anything it was blood amen 24 verse 6 he says here and Moses took half of the blood and put it in bathrooms and half of the blood is sprinkled on the altar and he took the book of the Covenant and read in the in the audience of the people and they said all that the Lord has said when we do and be obedient they were making agreement amen and Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said behold the blood of the covenant with the Lord has made with you concerning all these words amen so we're making a covenant with God that all that was written all that God spoke all that God wouldn't be done they were going to do it and they were going to obey amen and then Moses gets the blood to make a covenant between the people under God amen say this is a covenant that you've made today with your God that you're going to obey everything that you say amen so the blood was always a comment it was something that God was agreeing with the people binding himself with the people amen and when we see in the book of Genesis amen when Adam fell God came down from heaven amen and he looked for a lamp and he got the blood of the Lamb and sprinkle it over Adam and Eve in a right so everything it was blood blood blood amen so after sprinkle the blood over Adam and Eve that's when God again could have fellowship with Adam amen when Adam sinned he separated himself from God and there was no way God could have fellowship with Adam a game he had to take the blood sprinkle over them man agreement with them hallelujah amen so that's why in the Old Testament you find out everything it was blood amen so blood was to be applied on the sanctuary a man it was to be applied on the altar Brad was job applied in the Holy of Holies everywhere the blood was always being applied when the Wasco to come a man to worship before he enters is in a place of worship they were to sprinkle the blood over him amen so that was just the shadows of the things to come that even in me and you today before we come amen to be in real real fellowship with God amen there must be the shedding of the blood and we must be sprinkled with the blood and then the life of that blood must come upon us because the Bible says that time when they see no to come with alarm amen to sacrifice it he would bring it the priest and then he lay his hands on the RAM and then when he lays his hands on the lamp and when they are slaughtering of lamb you will feel that it is him will be dying amen the life of the lamp that was growing out of that lamp would be the life of the sinner and now when the blood of that lamb would sprinkle over the worshiper then the washbowl feel that is free from that death amen to feel no I am free I would have been the one to die but the love has died for my state amen as long as that blood that one blood would sprinkle over him then who will feel oh now I am free praise God but the blood of the animals could not come upon the worshiper and the premises that worshiper who do go back with the same guilt I'm going to go back to do their some things that he beat why because the life of the animal will not come back to the wash pot but it's our Lord Jesus came as a Lamb of God and down there in Jordan John the Baptist pointed people and say there is a lot of God who takes away the sins of the world Oh when the Pharisees was in looking at the lamp the animal lab there came a Lamb of God amen the Lord Jesus Christ with the blood of God himself amen so that when that blood hallelujah is wrinkle upon the wash path then the life that is in that blood must come upon the believer amen when we become one with our sacrifice amen let me with something here the provinces something here amen so their blood that was in alarm in the animal life could not come back to the worshiper because it was animal life amen but now the love of God Jesus Christ Himself came and died anybody's blood for us for you and me amen now their life that was in that blood must come upon the worshiper because he's no longer the blood of an animal is the blood of God amen and when the blood of God comes upon the worshiper then the blood of the worshiper is done away with if the blood of God comes down in your life in my life and we no longer live our own life we now live the life of the blood of God in us amen the promises he and the message showed the father it is suffice us he says God looking down out of heaven saying that is what it affects the blood amen it attacks the blood speaking what did you speak of yes after that the Lamb of God was led away amen you are the blood of your father and mother but being born again you become the blood of God the blood of Christ pleasing us amen amen so now the life that was in the blood of Jesus Christ comes upon the believers they worship ah me and you amen and then we become the blood of our Father that is what makes us be sons and daughters of God again not by coming to church no amen but by that blood coming in us and then when that blood comes in us then we have the blood of our Father hallelujah and then we have the blood of our Father then the life of the Father will be in us and every child will have the character of the blood of their father praise God I believe that's why Jesus when he looked at the policies he looked at their character he looked on their behavior he looked at what way do they were being he looked at it and said no the problem is the blood in you and they're wondering I said no we think from God is our Father he said no if God was your father you would do the works of your father but the blood in you is not of God and they say no our Father is God our fathers Abraham he said if I promised your father you would do what abrupted why because every child will manifest the character of the blood of his father amen praise God they say your father is the devil and is what you do he was a mother from the beginning that's what you are picking stones to restore me because you're manifesting the character of the blood of your father amen so if the blood of the father bringing us please God don't ever the Sun and every dot of God willing manifest the character of the blood of the Father because you can't manifest any other thing praise God you can't manifest in other life amen in the Wright brothers and that's why we find out Abel because were the son of God he came to manifest the character of the Father amen when when Abel came looking for the RAM and slaying the lamb he was only manifesting their character of the father the Bible says God had already slain the lamb before the foundation of the world amen even when I haven't even seen God again came looking for the love and his rule alone and now that blood was already in there was no way you could manifest another character praise God praise God hallelujah look at Abraham he went he goes together I'm saying this is my sister and when Isaac goes together he also says this is my sister you mean to tell me that a promise of told Isaac that when you go there you tell that the king that this is your sister no Isaac was only manifesting the character of the blood of his father whoa praise minimal or do you believe that that if you are here today you are here to manifest the character of the blood of your father amen praise God because life is in the blood and that life in the blood was to come back to the worshiper amen and Rob Rob says I think in a seal of God I don't remember amen maybe the conceded he says when a believer a man who lays hands on the Lord Jesus Christ and if you the pain of Calvary hallelujah amen and that blood that was indeed Christ was none other than God himself and when that cell comes to you as a worshiper amen then your spirit is blended out and the Spirit of God comes in you and that makes you a son and a daughter of God and then you start fellowshipping with God you are fauna praise God there is no way we can fellowship with God until 30 blood comes in you amen otherwise you just become a church member praise God a church goer oh praise be to the Lord but we need the life of the Father to come in us then we shall manifest the life of our Father which are manifest the character of our Father we shall talk like our father walk like our Father forgive like our Father love like our father hallelujah and everything our Father did we shall do also amen let me see this this one here I said we are not going to to give me a particle of time amen praise God I want us life to come upon me amen oh my the provinces here my he says he and I was a popular Salaam I'm in there the last knife go underneath throat and when it's dying and kicking his hands are Abed with the blood and he looks upon to your home and since Jehovah that should have been me but the lamb is taking my place but that man went back out to the same desire in his heart to see that he ever had because the life that was in the blood of the lamb was an animal life and the animal life animal on Spirit could come back and blend with a human spirit for money is an animal and the other is a human praise God otherwise we'll be acting like animals but if you took the blood of God himself but when Jesus died at Calvary and they worship ever comes to Calvary by faith lays his hands upon the head of the Son of God when his conferencing is wrong and he fills their tear and argon of Calvary that really paid his price that death that he should pay he feels that in his own soul praise God praise God and he does not desire to sing again praise God and the life that was in a blood cell of Jesus Christ who was none other than God himself and when that holy spirit that was in Christ's blood now the Prophet calls to life that is sell that was in the blood of just Christ to be the Holy Spirit amen he says now when that : spirit that was in the blood of Christ comes back to on him on me he makes me a new creature in Christ Jesus praise God so there is nothing that can make me new there is no no loss that can make me new no hallelujah he pecks the blood of jesus christ to come in my soul to make me new and i become a new creature in Christ Jesus amen therefore the master is blended out and God comes in and takes over being a god fellowship one with another praise God before that you don't have fellowship with God that's what you find that people only have intellectual faith but they cannot have fellowship with God amen until the life of God comes in you to make you to be a fan and a bit of God amen then you can have fellowship with your father glory hallelujah then they go flush is one with another other than a God that clearly heavens and earth that what is one grows in you amen they heavenly father their God who could be heaven and the earth 12 in that puzzle praise God they hold God rule of the heavens and and it comes any birth in you and as you're working you are working with God hallelujah praise God you become you become an amateur God hallelujah we are working but your food of God you have loved the creator of the heavens and earth praise God you look at yourself as a human being but you are not a human being then you become a spa natural being hallelujah oh my praise God amen see amen so sometimes we undermine ourselves we don't know who we are but then when we realize that the moment you receive the life of God in you you are no longer a motor-b you are as Penelope a son and a daughter of God amen no one uses I come from heaven and I go back to Haven I know people could understand him amen so the sons of God the goats of God amen they are supernatural beings the promises that one's own means God's own life amen God's own life comes on you why it makes you not have a beginning and not have an end the Steep brothers if God doesn't have a beginning then also you don't have a beginning any man that's what what this message is Magnus to me we don't have a beginning we don't have a name amen the province in America talking Geneva process paragraph 152 he says God is everlasting eternal talking it is eternal life by little Oh God and everything that other beginning has an end and everything at the beginning besides God and God is only form of eternal life very easy amen and when God blesses his Wallen spitting you wicked God himself amen and when God relative Philip within you you are as eternal as goodies mama hallelujah we are as eternal as God is not this body here but you are so a man says I give them eternal life no beginning no end that's what we are by resuming the life of God hallelujah amen because you're a part of him because he becomes a son and a bit of God and you're displaying his word he says Oh hallelujah I feel religious that is true God identifies himself you have got eternal life and that is God in you and this word lives and produces itself give you praise God hallelujah as you walk as you talk you are displaying the word Amen and the Bible says cross the angel get a book in the book and become the book hallelujah then you start displaying the book and in the beginning there was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God hallelujah and the word became flesh in the right in that what you are becoming now we are in the world and you are becoming in the world God in flesh because if the word is God then when we become the word then we become God amen no wonder when Saul was persecuting the apostle's he didn't know that the purifier had to become their posters praise God because he said why not he said I'm Jesus whom you persecute but Paul was not marketing the literal Jesus he was persecuting the Apostles amen because that word that was crucified that one we selected that one went to heaven that one came down from heaven or in our practicals and at the end if the Apostles praise God so when Saul was persecuting the Apostles he didn't know that they approached the pure fire and become the Apostles amen so we are becoming the one every day we get the rod every day we in the world we are becoming a lot and the prophecies we are becoming the word to challenge the egg that you are living in praise God the message that you are receiving now is to make you a rod I mean the one of God to challenge the age that you're living in praise God Oh praises or vain so you are displaying this one yes what is it they have always split the world are the beneficent to you by the holy ghost to vindicate this age now there is nobody who can adjudicate this egg apart from you and me praise God when the devil's are rising in this hour is only you can who can challenge the demons why because I become the one walking on two feet praise God when you are in the office it is God in office when you're driving is God driving hallelujah wherever you are it's God who is in that place whether you are at home you are a God in that home amen crazy holiday is not right to blog us and that's why the professors we beat better be careful what we speak amen don't call us even you

just like his father Alleluia I love that praise God amen praise God amen I want to close by saying this the Prophet says in a message they're talking he says if the blood of the father being you if the blood of God be in you then that blood will speak for you do you believe that it will speak Redemption it will speak healing if you speak deliverance all the them tonight if you speak for you praise God you believe that brother that the blood has a voice and says the voice of the blood is the word amen praise God if you speak for you that blood spoke for Abraham amen when when it when the King wanted to take his wife the blood-spot Fabra ha praise God say take back the man's wife he's a prophet amen that blood spoke for Jacob when Robin wanted to to follow him and I'm killing me said it is was in my power to do you harm but the God of your father's spoke to me and said don't do any harm to your co that blood spoke for Joshua in the book of Zachariah chapter 3 when the devil's was called piping fingers and say no no he's unclean the blood spoke for Joshua and our prophet is the Blood Moon is before us he says all the heavens and ever atmosphere is full of demons are accusing us everywhere he has done this yonder he has done these valleys but the blood is going to speak for us hallelujah you say the blood is speaking for us you bring the brothers the blood is speaking for you the peoples are pointing fingers at you but you are added applause hallelujah that's why when you come here when your mind is contaminated with these on the other and the preacher come here and start preaching the one what we doing is sprinkle you the blood and you go when your mind is washed by the washing of the water of the one hallelujah in your mind is clean your heart is clean praise God it is their blood is what the Prophet says the message of the hour becomes the blood to wash you in [Music] hallelujah so this message becomes the blood to wash you up to wash us clean to wash our hearts to wash our minds praise God amen amen do believe that brother we must be covered by the blood we must be washed by the blood amen and when that blood comes in you you become a new creature you don't longer remain just a church member let me say something as I'm closing amen I totally charge at home I say brethren we need to take a step amen some of us have come to church for long but there is no change at all amen some of us have been a message for years and years but there is no change at all the only change is the name of a missing believer amen I'm a messenger yes but there is no change of life there is no change of character they serve on on life is telling you there's a mall on character is review them all all behavior is Dylan you amen then their life the blood I've never come upon you and this the time for us to accept the blood to come in us and change us make us new creatures in Jesus he also say I'm a believer is not enough it takes the life of the blood to coming up and when I see the blood on the Passover you when I see the blood when I see the life of that blood in you and pass over you that's my desire that's my prayer amen well it is the life of the blood when we see the life of God in me let him pass no pleasure come on me no casual come on me no devil to come on me because I'll be covered by the blood may God bless you are we seeing that song I am gaba gaba

me praise the Lord when I see the Blood I will pass over you now your blood now your blood now your life when he see his blood praise the Lord the emphasis is now on the worshiper the emphasis is on the sacrifice praise the Lord amen there's nothing we can do to change ourselves the problem is that we've been making effort will be making effort and not be making enough effort on our sacrifice we have to make enough effort to identify ourselves with our sacrifice to believe our sacrifice to believe the work that was done in our place instead of trying to do the work we struggle to do the work instead of accepting what has already been done when I see the blood now your blood it's his blood when he see the life now your life he don't want you know our life will never be accepted it's just a filthy wreck the emphasis is not on the worshiper it has to come by revelation the emphasis is not on the worshiper the emphasis is not on the preacher the emphasis is not on the profit brother Branham the emphasis is on the sacrifice praise the Lord you can never be greater than your sacrifice it has to come a revelation we have to remind ourselves constantly Lord it is not me it's the sacrifice I need to believe the sacrifice I need to believe what was done in my place it's a simple but yet it is hard because God has to read a it to the to the to the worshiper that the emphasis is not the worshiper the high priest does not examine the worshiper the high priest examine the sacrifice the worshiper is not honor examination we have to remind ourselves that he's now looking at me he's now looking at you he's looking at the sacrifice and we must look at the sacrifice we must worship the sacrifice we must brace the sacrifice God were for this age what God has allotted for this age because is the age of the manifestation of the sons of God it's a kind of a high requirement I mean it's a kind of a higher requirement and what happened is that we try to struggle with our in ourselves to meet that requirement praise the Lord but he had made the requirement has already make a provision because his work and not go out and return back vow if he says he will have manifestation of the sons of God it will not be mean that will produce it it will not be you that will produce it it will be him so we have to keep believing him for it the emphasis is not on the worshiper the emphasis is on the sacrifice are we together tonight when I see the Blood I will pass over you price of the one they love bless you tonight a few couple of weeks ago we were talking on
