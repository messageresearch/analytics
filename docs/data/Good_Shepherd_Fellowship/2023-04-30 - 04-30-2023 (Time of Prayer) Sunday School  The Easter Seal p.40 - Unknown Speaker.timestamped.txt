[1:03] there was not to listen to it it was
[1:06] unstable and said any man that spoke in
[1:09] tongues and these things have claimed to
[1:12] be healed the sick and so forth by
[1:15] prayer that it was to leave away from it
[1:18] and to pray for those poor decrepit
[1:20] people
[1:21] because if they were in an illusion
[1:24] that there was something wrong with them
[1:26] oh how I would have liked to have talked
[1:29] to that brother just a little while and
[1:31] he said that the uh that that was only
[1:35] given for the apostles at the day of
[1:37] Pentecost and that was all I find that
[1:40] 30 years later Paul was ordaining these
[1:44] gifts in the church in First Corinthians
[1:46] 15 that he set in the church the gift of
[1:50] speaking in tongues Miracles and all
[1:51] these other gifts was set in the church
[1:54] Jesus said
[1:56] that
[1:58] go ye into all the world and preach the
[2:01] gospel to Every Creature how far all the
[2:05] world
[2:06] who to Every Creature they've never
[2:08] received it yet
[2:10] and these signs shall follow them that
[2:12] believe how long all the world who to
[2:15] every creature
[2:17] these signs shall follow them in all the
[2:20] world and every creature these signs
[2:22] shall follow them in my name they shall
[2:24] cast out Devils speak with new tongues
[2:26] if they'd taken up a deadly thing or
[2:29] surfing or drinking a daily thing will
[2:31] not harm them they'll lay their hands on
[2:33] the sick and they shall recover that was
[2:35] his last commission to the church Mark
[2:38] the 16th chapter Paul's are dating these
[2:42] gifts into the church 30 years later and
[2:45] said in Galatians 1 8 if an angel from
[2:48] heaven
[2:49] preaches to you any other gospel then
[2:53] this which is already received see
[2:56] already been preached let him be
[2:59] accursed
[3:01] I believe that Pentecost began without
[3:05] an ending I believe it's to be to every
[3:08] creature all times at all places that
[3:12] Pentecost should always remain the
[3:15] Pentecostal blessings should be upon the
[3:18] people and now what is this Pentecostal
[3:21] blessing it's a confirmation of the
[3:24] Resurrection
[3:26] no wonder the gospel itself means good
[3:29] news
[3:30] good news of what he's raised from the
[3:33] dead and because I live ye live also he
[3:40] was for Once Dead is sin in trespasses
[3:43] God has quickened us together but that
[3:47] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[3:49] dead
[3:50] and we are now sitting in Heavenly
[3:53] places with him
[3:55] communing with him talking with him what
[3:58] a joy to tell people that story that
[4:01] believes it to be the truth
[4:04] I'm wondering today that's what's
[4:07] happening are we really getting the
[4:10] people to go
[4:12] are we just getting them to church
[4:15] we must get them to Christ that's
[4:18] where this quickening power it's good to
[4:21] go to church sure if that's as far as we
[4:24] go oh it's not far enough
[4:26] when you come to church that's good but
[4:29] go on to Christ from the church
[4:32] because we must receive this quickening
[4:35] power if we ever expect to be in that
[4:39] General Resurrection because it's the
[4:41] only thing that will ever bring us from
[4:44] the dead for if this spirit that raised
[4:47] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[4:52] it'll also Quicken make bring to life
[4:56] your mortal bodies
[4:59] what a promise to us now
[5:02] notice the very essence of this
[5:04] Resurrection is to tell and to show and
[5:10] to prove that Jesus has raised up from
[5:13] the dead
[5:14] he's not dead he's a living
[5:17] he lives here he's in us I'll be with
[5:20] you even in you a little while in the
[5:23] world seeth be no more yet ye shall see
[5:26] me for I will be with you even in you
[5:30] unto the end of the world now as
[5:33] Christians we all claim he is alive or
[5:37] we've been quickened from uh quickened
[5:40] from life from Death To Life by his
[5:43] spirit and if we haven't been quickened
[5:45] then we've not been made alive
[5:48] now we're going to break into this
[5:50] subject the Lord willing and kind of
[5:52] teach it for a few minutes how that are
[5:55] we quickened and can we be sure that
[5:57] this is the truth
[5:59] now this is your own life
[6:01] this is my life
[6:03] it's where that the if this is the truth
[6:06] what I'm fixing to say then I'm one of
[6:09] the most foolish people in the world
[6:11] I've given my life for something there's
[6:13] nothing to and so have you
[6:15] but if it is the truth then I owe
[6:18] everything that I am oh everything that
[6:21] I could be to the cause of which we're
[6:24] standing for
[6:26] and I think that we mustn't lose our
[6:29] enthusiasm and as we see Easter
[6:32] approaching it just does something down
[6:35] in me as I I know that that's uh the day
[6:38] that the thing was sealed forever in the
[6:42] sight of God
[6:43] now we notice it's the same spirit that
[6:47] raised him from the grave that is
[6:50] dwelling in us now how could that be the
[6:53] spirit that raised up God Jesus from the
[6:56] dead has dwelling in us now
[6:59] now is the spirit that quickens it's not
[7:03] the word that quickens it's the spirit
[7:07] that quickens the word
[7:10] or gives the word life
[7:13] gives it wings to fly
[7:17] gives it access
[7:19] it's the spirit that does it now the
[7:23] wheat alone is just the wheat but when
[7:26] the quickening life gets into it into
[7:29] the wheat then it gives it life and we
[7:33] which were once Dead made in the image
[7:35] of God
[7:37] and yet dead is sin and trespass there's
[7:40] some way God had to get this quickening
[7:43] life into your mortal bodies I'm talking
[7:47] about your body now Jesus was the word
[7:52] you believe that don't you in the
[7:55] beginning Saint John 1 in the beginning
[7:56] was the word the word was with God and
[8:00] the Word was God and the Word was made
[8:03] flesh and dwelt Among Us now as the
[8:06] promised Messiah he quickened every word
[8:10] that was prophesied that he would do he
[8:14] oversick and high be born of a virgin
[8:16] all that made it
[8:18] it's true he was the word manifested
[8:21] here on Earth but he could not do this
[8:25] just as a man if taken the spirit of God
[8:28] dwelling in him to Quicken these
[8:30] promises to him
[8:33] uh hoping we get this real clear now
[8:36] Jesus being a man himself the body
[8:40] but it took the spirit in him
[8:43] the spirit
[8:44] it's not me that doeth the works it's my
[8:47] father
[8:48] that dwelleth in me he's the one that
[8:51] does the works see Jesus himself lost
[8:55] the word because he was before God this
[8:58] is a bad word to use and I hope you take
[9:00] it right before a crowd but he was
[9:02] predestinated
[9:04] by the foreknowledge of God how God's
[9:07] plan was to be that he would send a
[9:10] redeemer and this Redeemer could only be
[9:13] his own son so that that was God's
[9:16] promise all the way from the Garden of
[9:18] Eden that Jesus would be here here he
[9:21] was as a man born of a virgin but it
[9:24] taken the spirit of God to Quicken that
[9:27] word to him and he was the word
[9:30] quickened
[9:32] the word Quicken for that hour
[9:36] the time that come when you had to have
[9:38] a redeemer the law had failed
[9:40] other things that fail now it takes a
[9:43] redeemer and he was the promised
[9:46] Redeemer he was quickened by the word of
[9:51] God
[9:51] and now if that same spirit that was up
[9:55] on him to be the Redeemer in that age
[9:58] that we have accepted now the promise of
[10:02] in this last days what would take place
[10:04] if you become part of that word
[10:09] you are redeemed with him because the
[10:12] same spirit that dwelt in Christ is
[10:15] dwelling in you quickening your life to
[10:18] this age and it will also in the end
[10:21] time Quicken your mortal bodies
[10:24] resurrect and bring him up again
[10:27] that takes the Gloom away when we look
[10:29] at it and that and that's the truth see
[10:31] Romans here Paul has proved it to us see
[10:34] if the spirit that raised up Jesus and
[10:36] the dead dwells in you it will also
[10:39] Quicken your mortal bodies this is the
[10:44] same spirit that raised him up that
[10:47] quickened the True Believer to eternal
[10:50] life
[10:51] the spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[10:54] dead dwells into the believer quickens
[10:58] the believer to
[11:00] eternal life
[11:03] there's only one life one eternal spirit
[11:07] one eternal life and that's God God
[11:10] Alone is the Eternal and that weeping is
[11:13] children are part of him that is the
[11:16] attributes of his thinking and the
[11:20] thought is expressed and becomes a word
[11:23] that each individual in here that
[11:26] possesses this eternal life
[11:29] was before the foundation of the world
[11:32] in God's thinking
[11:35] it's the only way it could be because
[11:37] you're an attribute that's an expression
[11:41] of a thought has become a word and a
[11:44] word has taken life and it's Eternal
[11:47] that's the reason we have
[11:49] eternal life
[11:50] in the same principle that the great Son
[11:53] of God the Redeemer we become Sons and
[11:56] Daughters of God through that same
[11:58] Spirit by the same foreknowledge of God
[12:02] amen look at the Millions on Earth that
[12:05] didn't receive it when Jesus was shared
[12:07] but how thankful
[12:09] that we should be this morning to know
[12:11] that we have the direct evidence and the
[12:14] Bible proves that we are included in
[12:18] that great Resurrection morning coming
[12:20] that great Easter
[12:22] we have the earnest of it right now in
[12:26] our mortal bodies
[12:28] the predestinated ones are the first of
[12:31] course to be quickened when the Holy
[12:34] Spirit comes to claim its own now
[12:36] there's a great statement and I want my
[12:39] Minister Brothers to try to understand
[12:40] this
[12:41] in the beginning God the great spirit he
[12:45] wasn't even God then he was the Eternal
[12:48] one God is an object of worship he had
[12:51] nothing to worship him there was no
[12:52] there was no Angels no nothing just God
[12:55] Alone him alone is eternal but in order
[12:58] to be God there had to be something to
[13:00] worship him so he created angels and
[13:03] beings and uh cherubims and so forth to
[13:07] worship him his great plan began to
[13:09] unfold but remember you
[13:13] and the the statue that you are in this
[13:17] morning
[13:18] if you wasn't in his thinking then
[13:21] you're not now
[13:24] for you there's some part it's in you
[13:27] that's eternal
[13:29] and eternal only belongs to God
[13:33] and God was his thinking of you setting
[13:36] right where you are now
[13:38] in his thinking I stood at the pulpit
[13:41] this morning because he's infinite
[13:44] and knows all things therefore he could
[13:47] tell the end from the beginning because
[13:49] he's eternal
[13:51] and you being a Son of God or a daughter
[13:55] of God
[13:56] then you were in his thinking at the
[13:59] beginning
[14:01] and then when the Holy Spirit come in
[14:04] your own Earth
[14:05] walking around here is a sinner
[14:08] way down in your life is something you
[14:10] don't know what's taking place but
[14:11] you're hungry I heard the Presbyterian
[14:14] brother I heard the the Baptist talking
[14:16] about back there he was a a Free Will
[14:18] Baptist preaching where he can my fellow
[14:21] brother that you there's something in
[14:25] you
[14:27] something that you never put in there
[14:30] it's something that you couldn't desire
[14:33] to be in there if something is contrary
[14:36] to your own nature
[14:38] it's a foreign knowledge of God taking
[14:41] place
[14:42] God's word
[14:45] as Jesus is born the Son of God to be
[14:49] Emmanuel
[14:50] God's full expression in a man
[14:54] and he found him in perfect obedience
[14:57] down at the river of Jordan
[15:00] that task for that prophet
[15:03] and as soon as he obeyed him and walked
[15:06] out of the water the heavens opened to
[15:08] John and he saw the Holy Ghost
[15:10] descending from Heaven saying this is my
[15:12] beloved yes
[15:15] perfect obedience the spirit had sought
[15:18] him out in obedience
[15:21] oh Wayward man or woman this morning
[15:24] when you're sitting here and there's
[15:27] something in you telling you this is
[15:29] right it's a holy spirit seeking you out
[15:35] to bring you to a knowledge
[15:38] of Truth
[15:40] of this hour that we're now living
[15:43] not some hour that's gone by the hour
[15:46] now
[15:47] there was thousands there that are
[15:51] obeying our past but there was a present
[15:54] tense hour that was the hour that Jesus
[15:56] was to appear and there stood the word
[16:00] there stood the people and here was a
[16:03] manifestation of God taking place to
[16:06] vindicate that that was the truth
[16:09] and it's Pentecostal people today let me
[16:13] say this that we're standing in this
[16:15] last days where God promised he'd pour
[16:18] out his Spirit upon All Flesh and his
[16:21] sons and daughters should prophesy
[16:22] according to say these signs shall
[16:25] follow them and believe
[16:26] it's the hour that's what makes that
[16:29] Creation in you
[16:31] because I spoke here not long ago
[16:34] it sounded a little sacrilegious but I
[16:36] hope it don't tell you this morning the
[16:38] farmer that set the eagle or set the hen
[16:41] and had an eagle egg many of you
[16:43] remembers the story
[16:44] of the old Eagle giving birth to to this
[16:47] or the hand-given birth over here to
[16:49] this chicken or or egg of an eagle under
[16:52] her chicken feathers
[16:54] see it's the atmosphere the Presbyterian
[16:57] Church Methodist Church Baptist Church
[17:00] any of them can bring forth these Eagles
[17:03] sure it's the atmosphere that does it
[17:06] is Dr Bosworth you say you could take a
[17:08] hinting and put it over a under a pup
[17:10] and time down a puppet hatch out of
[17:13] chicken
[17:14] wow it's the atmosphere and when any
[17:17] church or any group that'll civil
[17:19] themselves together and pray until
[17:22] they're throw away their Creeds and
[17:24] things look straight in the face of God
[17:26] it'll bring forth Eagles this is hurt
[17:29] cause I'm standing here amen
[17:32] that's what I think this businessman's
[17:34] group has done
[17:35] trying to break up the atmosphere we're
[17:37] getting too clannish one belongs to this
[17:40] and that let's break up the atmosphere
[17:42] and get the atmosphere in a Heavenly
[17:44] worship
[17:46] get the atmosphere right Eagles will be
[17:49] born and out of any church anywhere
[17:52] that's right and this little Eagle
[17:54] walked with the hen for a long time
[17:56] but the the clucking was kind of strange
[18:00] and he didn't understand what the hen
[18:02] meant when she scratched in the the
[18:05] waist of the manure piles in in the
[18:08] yards and that wasn't food to him
[18:12] and she eat bugs and so forth that eagle
[18:15] doesn't eat so it seems strange all to
[18:18] him and he was an ugly duckling
[18:22] he was uh not seen as sacrilegious maybe
[18:25] it's a Free Will Baptist and but
[18:28] something on that order our Presbyterian
[18:31] but you know one day his mother knew
[18:35] that she had laid an egg
[18:41] there has to be a child somewhere
[18:46] so she thought her big wings into the
[18:49] winds and she searched then she searched
[18:52] screaming to the top of her voice
[18:55] and one day she passed over the barnyard
[18:59] and when this little Eagle heard this
[19:01] familiar scream you'd never heard it
[19:03] before
[19:05] but he realized that it fit him like a
[19:08] glove over him
[19:10] and he knew that was his mother
[19:13] she knew that was her son she was
[19:15] looking for him
[19:17] so has gone
[19:19] every age
[19:21] ordained his church for that age a
[19:25] message for that age
[19:27] and they could have laws in anything
[19:30] that they want to but when that hour
[19:32] comes the Holy Spirit
[19:34] of God which is at the beginning thought
[19:38] out and spoke out for that age that
[19:40] Spirit hunts that egg
[19:43] and when he hears that message there's
[19:46] no church denomination you're going to
[19:48] hold it in around
[19:54] it's a different bird
[19:57] it's a different creature
[19:59] he's the eagle and he'll hear the scream
[20:03] my sheep hear my voice
[20:08] as someone said brother Williams Shifu
[20:11] my sheep hear my voice a stranger they
[20:16] will not follow
[20:17] no matter how loyal the church has been
[20:19] how much it's bigger name is Scott when
[20:22] my sheep hear my voice which is the word
[20:26] a stranger they will not follow
[20:29] they'll go right straight to that word
[20:31] they can do it it's like a a magnet
[20:35] one day up in Indiana I was visiting
[20:38] steel mills
[20:39] and the whistle blowed and everybody
[20:42] took all their apers and began to sweep
[20:43] the out from their lays out into the
[20:46] middle of the floor the shavings that
[20:47] they'd made to the day
[20:49] and I was walking along with the man
[20:51] that was taking me through and he said
[20:53] watch this
[20:55] and so every man ladies
[20:58] is Vince dressed up on the up on the
[21:02] table walked away way back in the back
[21:05] he touched a little button and here come
[21:08] a big magnet through
[21:09] and it picked up every bit of that iron
[21:13] that was shaved off of those pieces
[21:16] uh it went out it demagnetized it it
[21:18] dropped into a cupola and was mailed it
[21:21] over for another piece of of goods the
[21:24] same thing
[21:25] axles or whatever they were building
[21:28] and I stood there and looked at that
[21:29] time I just lost myself
[21:32] and I said I'm wondering something he
[21:35] said what is it sir and I said I noticed
[21:38] that some of that didn't go up
[21:41] he said it's aluminum
[21:43] and the magnet is not magnetized to the
[21:46] aluminum
[21:47] see and he said then I said well do you
[21:51] notice there's a piece of iron laying
[21:53] across but you see sir it was bolted
[21:55] down
[21:56] I said I see and uh what do you talk it
[21:59] out and I said now what happens that out
[22:01] there says it goes right back into the
[22:03] mill poured out to the cupola it comes
[22:05] right back and makes another wheel
[22:07] I said praise the Lord that's it see
[22:10] there is a great magnet sitting in the
[22:12] sky that God one day will touch his
[22:14] fingers to him no man knows the time
[22:17] he's coming not even the angels of
[22:19] heaven doesn't know
[22:20] God Alone knows
[22:22] but there is been some trimmings that's
[22:26] come off of the Bible
[22:29] Bible Christians Believers for this hour
[22:33] one of them might have been Axel back in
[22:35] another day this might be some other
[22:37] part
[22:37] it's going on to make the big regime of
[22:40] God
[22:41] but it'll be molded into the pop of
[22:44] God's Great cupolo and pour it out again
[22:47] into the images of God
[22:50] you are magnetized to it will be taken
[22:53] up
[22:53] all out of what a privilege it is to
[22:57] know that there is something in the
[22:59] resurrection that's pertaining to us
[23:02] now notice it recognize the call of
[23:05] God's word which is
[23:11] [Music]
[23:17] foreign
[23:24] [Music]
