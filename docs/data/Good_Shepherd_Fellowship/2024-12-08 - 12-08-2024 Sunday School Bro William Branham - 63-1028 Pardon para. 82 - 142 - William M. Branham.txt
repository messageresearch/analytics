TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] the Jew could be justified because he did what Jehovah bid him to do finally that was right Jehovah did that and that was what he required but finally that became a family tradition it come atonement day and maybe the Jews have been doing what was wrong he'd say well I believe it's atonement day I better take my lamb down see it become a family tradition they didn't go with it with sincerity they just did it because the families had done it that's just the the thing we should do all the families do it so we should do it too and that's just exactly where our Christianity's got that's just exactly where our Pentecostal movements are coming to it's a family tradition see we don't we don't identify ourselves with our sacrifice that we are dead with our sacrifice we are we say oh we're Christians because I went and joined the church joining the church is fine but until you are identified till you lay your hands upon him and you and he become one until the spirit of Christ becomes in you in you in Christ until you become a son and daughter of God there don't seem to be the sincerity that they they are to have it's becomes a a ritual just the same as it is now it's a ritual for people to become a Christian here's some time ago I asked the young lady in the prayer line are you a Christian she said well I'm an American I'll give you to understand now like that had anything to do with it an American it's great to be an American but that don't mean you're a Christian you've got to be born again another woman I asked how are you a Christian why she was so put out she said I'll give you understand I burn a candle every night like that had anything to do with it you've got to be identified with Christ and his life living in you that's when you're identified with Christ as when Christ lives in you it isn't a ritual it isn't belonging to church that's all good but you see the real sincerity when we come to the healing Services if you'll notice on the discernment in the line it's constantly tell people to repent see there you go to our prayers has become a tradition we kneel down at night and say Lord bless so and so and bless so and so and do this and help John do all this you make God a mascot or you make him a some kind of Aaron boy God you do this and you do this and you do this that's not the way Jesus told us to pray he said to pray like this Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done and Earth as it is in heaven but we try to order God what to do for us and that's the reason the church is cooling off that's why the great Revival has just struck the land has put Millions into the church it's if they have got to a place that they're using these experiences and so forth as a tradition instead of being Godly sorrowful and letting the Holy Spirit do the work of his office within you and creating in You a New Life and making you so hungry to go to church that you can't stay away from church man that's what it is not to sign tickets and jar and have so forth It's to be have the Life of Christ in you that he just longs to go there's something within you a pushing you as I Sayang to a young man yesterday in a talk a little interview I said I used to pass by a little spring when I was a game warden in Indiana and there was is always the happi spring I ever seen in my life life great Springs in Indiana they Bubble Up of that fine cold water of limestone water and one day I sat down with the spring to talk to it just like I guess Moses would have set to the burning bush to speak with it and I said little spring what makes you so happy that you're bubbling all the time if I come here in the winter time you're bubbling if I come spring autumn summer whenever it is you're bubbling is it because that maybe perhaps you're so happy that the rabbit's coming drink out of you well now if he could talk he'd said no that's that's not it I'd say well maybe because deers come by and drink out of you he'd say no that's not it I'd say no well maybe it's because I come by once in a while and drink from you no that's not it I'm glad that they all come and drink but that's not the reason that I'm bubbling all the time well what makes you bubble like that what makes you so happy always gushing up if he could talk he'd say it's not me it's something behind me pushing me that's the way it is with a Christian experience it isn't something that you're trying to work up it's something behind working in you it's eternal life that's moving up gushing up like a as he told a woman at the well it'll be Wells of water springing up into eternal life it's something within the worshipper when he's been identified with Christ because he knows that he is alive but we don't want it to become a tradition when Israel got to a place that they made the Commandments of God god with their sacrifices or tradition it was then that the mighty prophet Isaiah was sent by God to them with thus sayith the Lord somewhere somehow God always can put his hand on a man that's not afraid to strip down the thing that's somewhere someplace Isaiah rose up if you read Isaiah 1 I got written here Isaiah told him said your sacrifices that Jehovah required has become a stink in my nose I despise them in the fats of rams and and of heers and so forth God despised them the very thing that he commanded them to do because they made it a ritual then God despised it because they made it a ritual and we can make the word of God the same thing amen right when we come to it as a tradition as a ritual we must come to it knowing it's so thus sayth the Lord if God promised it God will stand by his promise he's bigger than he's promised he's always been he's able as Abraham said to perform that which he had promised to do he's always able to do that to keep his word now Isaiah told him said all these things that they had been doing they had done it without sincerity they had done it just because the rest of them was doing it there because doing it also because it was a requirement of Jehovah and all the family did it and the mothers did it and the grandfathers did it why couldn't they do it now we do the same thing my grandfather was a presbyterian so I'm a presbyterian my daddy was a Baptist so I'm a Baptist and so forth and my daddy was a Pentecostal so I'm a Pentecostal that isn't it we come to the spot of where we realize that we have separated we are separated from God and we come upon the base of the shed blood of Jesus Christ under that blood there's where the Methodist Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian Pentecostals can all Meet on Common Grounds regardless of tradition they or ritual they can meet there under one common thing and that's upon the blood of Jesus Christ until the church gets back to a place and away from its rituals and back to God's original plan that men are born into the kingdom of God and not joined into the church p a time that Fellowship will rain everywhere and the spirit of the Lord will cover the Earth like the waters covers the sea when it comes to a place that man can forget their differences and come together in Fellowship under the blood we cannot all come under the Baptist tradition under the Presbyterian tradition under the Methodist tradition under the Pentecostal tradition but we all can meet and fellowship under the blood of Jesus Christ Christ because it's God's original plan that's right amen there's the pardoning a Methodist can look at a Baptist and hold his head sideways and the Baptist look at the Pentecostal the Pentecostal back of the Baptist on their Traditions but when they meet under to the Cross where the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses all man from sin he's a new creature in Christ Jesus he's a brother no matter what brand he's branded with he's a brother because that's one ground that we can all meet on it's God's way of doing it these other thing are man-made Creeds injected into this but God's original plan for pardoning is under the blood of Jesus Christ that's God's plan of doing it yes TR traditions in them days the great prophet cried out and he said your Traditions are powerless they stink before me have no faith in them the people was offering these offerings without even having faith in what they're doing now let's just ask oursel the question isn't that something like today as bad as we hate to say it we've got to face back somewhere there's something wrong somewhere while this church ought to be a million miles up the road to where it is now Jesus is waiting on his church to get ready his bride has made herself ready we got the potentials the holy spirit is here God is here the power to heal the sick the power to do all the things that Christ did I've seen it demonstrated Myself by the holy spirit so the potentials are here what God's waiting for us to get away from is our traditions and come back under the blood of his son Jesus Christ and become the Church of the Living God Methodist Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian whatever more whosoever will may come and take of the Waters of Life freely I believe that with all that's in me we God has sent down the Holy Spirit to do that but we with our rituals without sincerity we going is because of TR a tradition and because it's a ritual we go without sincerity Without Really sorrowfulness of sin I noticed the other night in that great famous meeting of one of our great renowned Brothers in California and on notice that meeting as those people come down young teenage children I admire the brother for his great stand anybody would if you position see what place he's taken in the last days you will too and as I notice those people coming down to the altar to make a decision girls chewing chewing G boys punching one another people laughing that isn't the way to come Godly sorrowful you must come under conviction God send us an oldfashioned penticostal Holy Ghost Revival that'll bring sin to the roof and bring conviction to men and women not to say I'll go back to the church and I'll renew my fellowship I'll sign a card that's all right but you can jarn the Masons odd fellas and anything you get the same results but when you come under God's pardoning atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ there's got to be a sincerity set in there God requires sincerity if it cost him such a price to give his only begotten son how are we going to get B under a little laughing uh Affair and come join church and make a decision card and take it into the church and whatever it might be that's not God's requirement he that goeth forth sowing in tears will doubtless return again rejoicing bringing with him precious sheep we need a sheep bringing people I heard the great evangelist say one time when I was tending one of his breakfast picked up the Bible and I always admired him he said here is the standard that's what God requires he said I'll go into a city I'll have a Revival said I'll have 20 or 30,000 make the decision I come back in about four or five years or maybe two years and said I can't find 15 or 20 said St Paul went into a city and he made one convert he come back in another year he had 30 or 40 from that one then he said it's a lazy preachers that sat with their feet up on the desk and don't go out to see the people I admire his courage for Bing out his Brethren and things up on his conviction but I'd like to ask him this question what preacher told that one back there under Paul when there was no churches for him to go to what was it Paul taking him from a tradition or signing a card into the baptism of the Holy Ghost when he Soul was on fire for God he had to testify and say things his whole soul was a burning with a flame of fire that God had put in there what we need tonight is a sign that a man or woman is saved watch them go after other Souls as quick as he can he said one time that a bartender a little boy come in and said Mr your bartender he said yes Sunny said your sign is down he said uh well thank you Sunny so he walked outside and the little boy stood with his hands behind him and the bartender looked up and there was a great bar room on a big brass plate advertised he took his his uh Aon and polish just said Sunny you you're mistaken my sign's up he said no sir said it isn't said I mean your your best sign he said that's the best sign I got he said oh no look laying there and there they a drunk in the gutter that was the best sign he had yeah when he's seen a man under the influence of what he was studying on the inside and when we see a man under the influence of the Holy Spirit to tell his life are burning with oldfashioned Pentecostal power that's the best sign God ever had that that man is saved Ser it's the best sign now how will that come about not by joining church but by accepting his pardon through Jesus Christ your innocent subtitute no sincerity no real srow for sin he said he hide his face from their rituals their prayers were powerless they prayed oh sure they went up there and said their prayers they offered their sacrifice it become a farm do you know in 2 Timothy the 3r verse of the third chapter of second Timothy we're told the same thing that we'd get in the last days the Bible said here in the last days no this is the time will come when man be hey High minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers are those that are good having a form of godliness but denying the power there from such turn away for this is a sort that go from house to house and Lead silly women lay away with divers lust never ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now if the Bible predicts that the hour would come when the church would get in the same tradition there was there by the rituals here it is again a traditional religion powerless oh you said them were Communists no they wasn't having a farm of godliness they go to church they draw on church and try to uh make along showing that they are go to church and things and go out and live different there's no fire in their soul there's nothing they're not interested in anybody else everybody else can die and go if they want to we feel that we're saved let the rest of them go that is real Christianity Christianity is go after the Lost go get that brother go do something about it can we stand and fold our hands even if we claim that we're saved and see men and women dying on every hands and this streets full of women going to churches with shs and and painted faces and and walking up and down the street with cigarettes in their hands and and paint all over their face it looks like I Foxes or Wolves or something and man walking up and down the street jining churches and things like that and call that Christianity and hold your peace what would St Paul do if he walked in Tucson I tell they'd have him in jail for morning that's right why his soul would burn for God tell he couldn't keep from doing it sure but we draw Church you see our Traditions has become extinct in the face of God what we need today is a prophet arise on the scene with thus sayth the Lord and strip those Saints to the bottom and say that they become a stink our denominations have grown and our churches are big and they're uh fighter than they ever was we'd be a lot better off with a tin pan standing on the Alley again with a guitar out there beating a drum or something other with the real Pentecostal fire burning in our souls and the set the great pews that we're setting in today Dy the world Hing under our feet yes sir God has a pardon and that pardon only through Jesus Christ education tradition denominational scientific nothing will ever take its place it's under that blood it's under the tradition not the tradition but under the blood of Jesus Christ God's provided way for Sinners the only way that we can ever meet I tell you you take a Methodist take a Baptist and a presbyterian and a Lutheran and a Pentecostal and let each one come under that blood they're Brothers there's no fussing about them man no Sirah they are brothers they see everything alike but you let a Methodist get to fussing with the Baptist on the order of baptism let a Oneness fuss with a trinity a trinity with a Oneness and whatever more watch the and hares but let them both come on the cross and watch what takes place shall be till I die then in a nobler sweeter song I sing this power to save when this poor lisping stammering tongue lies silent in the grave I give testimony tonight that the blood of Jesus Christ makes a Methodist Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian whatever he is my brother yes sir there's something in fellow because his spirit is is a brother he isn't a fusser and and something others he's a brother in Christ he believes every word that's in that Bible how can the Holy Spirit who wrote the Bible tonight how can the Holy Spirit living in a man saying oh that's for the disciples that Jesus said whosoever will Peter said the promises un to you and your children them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call the Holy Ghost was for whoever God call amen here he said those who he predestinated he forne he are ordained and they accepted no man can come to me said Jesus except the father draws him and all that the father has given me will come to me do we come in a worked up emotion do we come to join the church do we come because we don't want to go to hell or do we come because we love God do we come in a worked up emotion do we come to join the church do we come because we don't want to go to hell or do we come because we love God that gave His only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall have everlasting life do we come because it's a love sacrifice that God gave to us that we might display display it God hates a powerless religion their religion has no power so what must he do to this day he hates a every time in the Bible that God ever outside this side the Bible every time there ever come a Reformation or a Revival it was backed with Great Signs and pow amen when Luther came forth when Wesley came forth when all the reformers sanky finny Knox Calvin whoever where there come there was power demonstrated where God is he supernat where God displays himself there's got to be Supernatural look at the Pharisees in that day who came to Jesus and they talk about meekness and sweetness who is any sweeter than the old priest who is any greater than their priest he comes to you when you're born if he's a fuss the neighborhood he comes and settles it and he's always a peacemaker he's a loving man you know he is when you're in trouble you can go to him he helps you what about an ice man then speaking of this Jesus of Nazareth this priest we know who his father was his father's fathers father's father we got a school here that identifies him who is this Jes e [Music] for [Music]
