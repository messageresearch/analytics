right to the word that brother Jordan if you will put that uh or that that uh sister Dorcas back there amen I call all the technicians brother Jordan amen sister fit I'm very sorry for that I always ask who's back there but then uh okay okay yeah I left my little notes uh on my study table at home but that's fine now I can stay get myself here the Lord bless you you may okay let's let's read the word let's read the word that's a good thing uh Psalm chapter eight Psalm chapter eight this morning we want to speak on what is man that thou are mindful of him that's why we want to talk we want to we want to talk about God's visitation the day of visitation when God visit man we want to look at it in in different ways Psalm chapter 8 if I'm right Psalm chapter 8 thank you praise the Lord Psalm chapter 8. Psalm chapter 8 and let's let's do uh that's nine nine verses let's do a responsive reading if that's okay with you oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth who have said that Glory above the heavens you read the next one when I consider the heavens The Works of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou has ordained what is for thou had made him a little lower than the angels and have crowned him with Glory and Honor All Ships and oxen yeah and the beasts of the field let's read the last verse together oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth praise the Lord as a Hebrew chapter 2. Hebrew chapter 2. now when you read the book of Hebrews not only read the book of Hebrew but if you study the book of Hebrew you will see because Paul was sending this letter to his people the Hebrews that's the reason why you see it does not have no introduction like Paul the Apostle no he did not introduce himself why because he was not accepted by them he was an apostle to the Gentiles so when he was sending this book to the to the Hebrew believers Paul from Hebrew chapter 1 to the last chapter you will see how he connected the Old Testament he kept showing them see this in the psalm see this what David says see this what Moses said he kept pointing them to the psalm I mean to the Old Testament over and over praise the Lord just to bring them to the place for them to realize that everything that was given honor the Lord was a time all of those things were fulfilled in Jesus Christ are we together praise the Lord so uh we take Hebrew chapter 2 let's read from verse 5. I think we read a little bit of that it was chapter one we read on uh on Wednesday night For unto the angels have he not put in subject the word to come whereof we speak but one in a certain place testified who was that one David that we have just read one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou are mindful of him or the son of man that thou visited him let us pray father we want to ask your blessings upon the word Lord we we bring all of our needs Lord because we we we are needed people we will ever be in need of you until we meet you face to face so we bring all of our knees Lord our needs as individuals our needs so God as families the needs in the different homes that are represented here this morning that are even streaming into the service Lord father the needs of Godfather of our individual life we bring it to you Lord God and we we bring the need Lord father or brother John Bibi this morning that is not well having the stomach upset ache we pray that God you will touch our brother and you will you will just manifest healing to him oh Father God we prayed Lord for all the one's Lord Jesus oh god father that are struggling to take a position in the world we just commit them into your hands this morning Father just just thinking about they are just just uh singing that song this morning that the word is working mightily in us so God uh above what we can feel what we can see because we will not be able to feel it is we we only see the result when the world has worked mightily in us we never feel when we are delivered we only see the result with a new life we never feel when we are safe we want to see the result Lord because we love you we know what we were yesterday we know what we are today so Lord we can say that the word is working mightily beyond what we can feel and what we can see and Lord we want to we want to keep that in our mind we want to keep that because it helped us to build daily expectation to be looking for for for for things that you you you you have already done and the result is going to manifest in our body we pray this morning bless us now in your presence in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed if you can put my code of anti-g mama up let's read the code and then uh we will show the picture of ntg mama brother Branham use this over and over now the reason why I'm I'm going to use this code I want to keep your your your our thoughts in mind the reason we have we are focusing towards the word that is working my telling now we're going to see how the word uh uh work for for Entergy Mama the world worked for enter your mama uh because she was able to identify a scripture in the Bible praise the Lord in the book of Kings chapter 4 she was able to find a woman that looks just like her she was able to place herself in a scripture and so when she says that this woman condition looks like my condition Lord where is my Elijah God was able to bring her Elijah that's how the world works it does not works with our complaining it does not works it works with you identifying a promise and say Lord this is your word bring it to pass in my life are we together so let's let's let's read that uh does God God does encouragement to judge me with our first warning him that's what better Branham take this from but uh uh I think I look through the message close to about 29 different times uh he mentioned this testimony of Auntie Jemima then there there used to be a little song called he says there used to be a little song and uh I remember the day down there in uh uh Chattanooga Tennessee when I met this you know he was talking about uh uh there are people every word one of them okay that's that's the song he was trying to refer to where I met this little color red woman you know standing out there let's continue to read [Music] I just throw this one back there for an introduction uh let's go to the to the next part of their code you have heard me tell about it you know her board how veneer disease and she had this man's shirt tied around her head I want you to pay attention to that and she had this man's shirt she had a man's shirt tie around her head leaned over the bench like that and the laws stopped the plane there and wouldn't let it go somehow and they told me uh come get the holy the holy spirit said take a little trip and go down this way and I went walking down through there singing I talked my my plane about ready to leave just kept saying move on the Holy Spirit kept saying move on keep going keep going just that early part of my Ministry and I look leaning across the fence there and a little bitty uh Shanty a little place there there was an old sister standing there oh she was looked like one of these sisters on the antique Jemima pancake great big fat cheeks you know and her hair her shirt uh brought on back she leaned across the gate like that I will stop right there and if you can put up my picture and uh just pull up the picture okay just like how brother Brandon preached the message uh uh tinky's man fitter from a secretary Park this was the picture that he was referring to and that's where he took the name entity mama praise the Lord we got till tomorrow we don't know the woman name okay at first I wanted to to name myself wake up to enter your mama pancake I have to look for an inspiration to preach that because I found the court he said just like one of those sisters on the entity Mama pancake so because of this tine of the hair and he saw the lady tying her hair leaning over the fence that's the only thing he could remember to be able to put a name to the story so that's where the story entered your mama was birthed from that action in this picture so I hope you wake up this morning to empty your mama pancake praise the Lord God bless you take it down now so just like I said but the the interesting thing there is that uh she was able to find a place in the word right she find a scripture she says I'm just like this woman the shimmy night woman Lord where is my Elijah praise the Lord and out of desperation she went out and and she was just there waiting and brother bear I'm coming and uh uh you know not even know where he was going the Holy Ghost kept telling him you walk down there you go down there and you go down there and uh uh you know uh and uh and then the Holy Spirit kept telling him to go he didn't know where he was going praise the Lord never gave him a vision to describe the house or everything but it was one poor woman that had a dying child that was able to find a promise in the Bible it was her faith that was controlling the man of God praise the Lord how Faith was controlling the man of God and when brother Branham got down there she said good morning Pastor and you know the story just like bird brand said you know so that's why we are not reading everything he said good morning Pastor she said good morning Pastor Ben look over his shoulder he realized he was the only person there he says have it you know that I'm a passion praise the Lord and the thing about the story also that uh uh we must also realize we will have to know that there was a time where the the country had a lot of racial attention and the place that he was walking he was not supposed to be there okay but yes a man that was obeying the Holy Spirit not paying attention to what the atmosphere was around him he kept going he kept going he's looking at his watch uh uh well I mean when my plane leave then they leave but I felt in my heart that the Lord want me to go keep moving and he keep moving I believe everyone that was out there early morning was saying so what is this is that an FBI officer or you know what was going on here everybody looking at him strange but he's just obeying the Holy Spirit praise the Lord until the woman identified him as a preacher good morning person how do you know that I'm a passion the conversation started and then before brother Branham really understood that this was the reason why I was making the train praise the Lord before he honors to that this was the reason why after he went into the The House of the woman pray for the boy and uh you know uh the boy confessed and said Mama there is light in this place you know but Brian knew that well work was gone pick up his bag went rocking straight back there was no uh lift to other lift and he had to walk the same way he walked down he had to walk that way back got to the airport the scene the the his name was on the overhead William Branham William Branham this flight is about to leave so the word is working the word works this word it works praise the Lord it is the word that is governing the universe the word works are we together amen the word works so uh on on Wednesday night we we went in a little Direction talking about Hebrew chapter four I'm trying to bring this thing to a close as I realized that we have uh Paul uh uh appraising of on our our Sunday school tape in the morning and uh over the weeks I will be I'll be picking up places there to to comment on as we will be going about so uh uh uh yeah I have a note here let me let me just uh cover it quick because I have my far over it this coming Wednesday we will have a brother femi that's a brother daily younger brother he will be visiting with us so he will preach for us Wednesday night and then Sunday uh I wanted to come and spend some time with me so uh we will have him Wednesday preaching for us but brother delay will be with us on September 6th and right after

better Chris Long's son he will be here with us that weekend and uh uh a few greetings came from South Africa this this uh this past week uh been having a lot of few talks back and forth there with some of the brothers and uh one of the brother brother David Gonzalez he's supposed to be coming through the U.S so well he actually stop and see us so when he come in we will see where we can fit him and Brother Joseph a money that used to be with us that moved to Virginia and now he's all back in Houston uh Texas called yesterday I want to also bring greetings to the church and a friend of mine Joseph manbele also called and he asks that we pray for he and his family brother Forrest farmer brother Clay farmer dad will be traveling to Togo on Monday and uh he'd be doing some service there for brother duodoni uh Gone TV over in lome Togo so he called yesterday and and you just wanted to touch base with me a little bit or if I know the people there which of course I told him yes I do and uh he wanted us to greet the church and he asked that we pray and keep his trip in prayer praise the Lord uh I'm not I'm very well sure that that is is one of his first time in that part of the world and so he he's asking that we really really keep him in prayer praise the Lord amen the Lord was work a very tremendous thing in brother Farmers Health recently so we want to thank the Lord for that amen yeah I got uh I'll completely get out of what I was saying but Wednesday night we were we were talking about the word we were trying to the word of God is Shepherd in the two-edges swore okay and you uh I wanted to but you can go and search it out just you can just go and search it out uh you can put it right on Google and just and just look for the Bible verse that says the heart is incurable men in uh uh many uh different uh version of the Bible I think I think the I think the amplifier used the same let me let me quickly get there and what was that verse that we use on uh that was from Jeremiah we can remember on Wednesday night Jeremiah it's just anybody to remind us Jeremiah 17 9. okay Jeremiah 17 9. thank you if you if you read it out of the Amplified it says the heart is deceitful Above All Things and it is extremely sick it is extremely sick who can understand it fully and know a secret motives all the versions say the heart is incurable you see for the wicked and incurable so like I said on Friday Wednesday night that's what God has to give us a new heart now uh uh he has to give us a new heart so we were talking about how it takes the word it takes the word to be able to to address that's the only thing the soul of man can feed on praise the Lord that's the only thing the soul of man can feel on we read a cold weather band see science found that place in the heart of man where there is no blood vessel entered it's a little chamber and they believe that that compartment is where the soul is that's where the word gold is sharper than a two-edges sword to divide dividing asunder of the Soul and Spirit so we realize that in that chamber that's that's where our our rear brain is in that chamber where the world goes there and just like when we eat food the food goes to our body and then the the the the the you know the the the intestine does this work it breaks down the food there is there is other parts of the body that change HIV you know and and the blood the heart stop pumping it as a blood Distributing it all over the body you know so that that is the same way with uh with the word when we when we when the word is preached or we read the word and the Holy Spirit can drop that word down in our heart drop that word in that compartment then you know the Holy Ghost break it and then he distributed to our body the portion of the word that is for for healing he give it to you for healing the little part of it that is for knowledge you think that all you know too much that is just a little part it's a residue that he gives to you and you think now you know I get a revelation I just a waste product amen the actual thing goes in you for you to live the word God is more interested in us living the world amen then then just talking about it are we together now so uh as we as we talk about that and and then we we we read we read a quote about uh the the the cherubins I I kind of folk did not have time to go through all of that but what actually I I what I was doing was that or trying to achieve was to make us to know that uh the cherubim that were guarding the treat of life was actually they were guiding is the word the word is the Tree of Life amen man shall not lay by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God are we together amen you might you might run ahead of me and see the truth of life is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the word the tree of life was not Jesus Christ yeah uh it was Christ it was I was it was the anointed word for that time praise the Lord yeah because I know that we are all smart people you know more smart people in the building they mean so let me help myself out quickly before I get in trouble praise the Lord now so uh so uh so the the cherubins were guiding the word now you have to realize there as as they were they will partake of that word they were to live forever but they break the word they left the word amen so the child being was was keeping them from the word that will keep them to live forever because they have already brought the word and a portion of the word say the day you eat of this fruit that day you will die so for them to constantly be going back going that honor his word they have already eat of the fruit they must die praise the Lord now so brother Branham says something here that is very very interesting I want I want you to listen to it so we can we can be able to go on right here he said earnestly concerning for the Fate praise the Lord and enslake containing for the faith he says right here then they both come up to worship before God talking about uh Aaron and Eve and I believe it was it was east of the gate and I believe they come right up before his presence their word where their flaming sword was running around the east side of the gate that's the cherubins now like that guiding the treat of Life Look yerry said I hope you get it just as sure as man is man is born of a woman he has to die praise the Lord he says I hope you get this they were the the cherubians were guiding the tree of life because they have broke the word so it was sure that man born of woman Must Die they cannot Escape that and live forever they have broke the word they must die so for God to ever take that curse of death away he have to take it upon himself [Music] okay so he says just as short as a man born a woman has to die is just that show if he's born of Christ he got to live praise the Lord amen so you see why now the the the the the the the the cherubings gathered their soul back like we said on Wednesday night they have to put their soul back why because one has come and he has taken the curse of death so now instead of then God in the treat of Life they have to now lead us back to the treat of life amen so the man born a woman without Christ will surely die and perish but when a man is born in Christ better man says nothing can stop it are we together if he's born of Christ he got to live he got to live he can help it you just can't help it if you are just stubborn God will just call you of the earth that's all you can help it if you are born of Christ there is nothing you can do to drive yourself by you go to hell hair will reject you right are we together if he's born of Christ he got to live he got to live he can't help it he got eternal life Christ said he had it now in that day God in a treat of life then forgetting it they were guiding the children of life so they can't get it they can't get to it now their sword turned right back the other way running them down to the treat of life the soul has turned now so the cherubins were guarding the word and the reason why I'm making the emphasis on that is because that the anointing of God in the word is the same anointing that has come on the five for Ministry when we talk about the the Apostle the the the the the evangelists the the the the the prophet the pastor the teacher you know uh uh I'm using my five fingers to remember you have to realize that until I place them in the five fingers so I'm using my five fingers to remember them so uh uh uh is that seem anointing and the reason why I want to make that emphasis is because the purpose is what to lead us to the tree of life not to make a church not to make a denomination amen praise the Lord and is that same anointing God in the word that comes on the believer as the gifts of the Spirit it must lead us to the word not to make one person spiritual in the church not to make you an idol is the same spirit that has come they are same anointing has come even in our home it must guide us toward the word now that in our family that's it we are not protecting family dignity what we are called to protect is the word we are now protecting family property ananias and so far I try to do it they died because they were not protecting the word everything must lead back to the word praise the Lord now you see when we have that understanding when we have that understanding even even as a preacher as a pastor and when I understand that that is my responsibility and I realize I'm not Leading the People Back to the word I must I must I must caution myself praise the Lord the same thing in in in in you know in in every in every part of uh the church in every part of our lives praise the Lord take for example under the Old Testament type if you take what is what was happening there in uh in in Jericho or in in Canada land with with with aircon they had a promise there was the the word was they were not supposed to take nothing from nothing of the land we spoke about it God told him everything Jericho is mine the whole city will be burned down the only thing that will be saved was Rahab in her household that's the only tie that God took out of Jericho are we together so you see it gets to the place where we don't protect personal interests the only thing we must protect is the word that's the only thing we must protect if we want the word to work for you you must protect the word not personal interests praise the Lord sometimes erupt against us as parents sometimes erupt against us even as husband and wife praise the Lord but if we want the word to work my telling for you lead your husband back to the word say honey that's not the word lead your wife back to the website I love you but this is not the word praise the Lord amen I mean Lord never talk he stood there and never talked but then his wife turned to a pillow of salt [Music] are we together that that that is the principle I'm trying to bring out that's that's word I'm trying for us to be able to to understand the position of these cherubimes because the word was broken they were to protect so that's the reason why I honor the Old Testament they were all under the blood of bulls and goat eternal life will never struck the human soul until God came and gave his own life are we together then the the cherubies now took their sword and put it in their shade let's go this way and they are now driving us so that anointing comes on the fight for Ministry God uh Paul says when he has sent it up high he gave gifts to man that's what we want to do is he gave the same anointing that was guiding the Tree of Life to come back on the church to lead us back to the presence of God you'll realize that the same anointing came on the church ages if you read the church ages book you a real life better man said the first three Church Ages were the ages of great missionary work I was trying to do a PowerPoint this morning and uh just it was I was just going crazy about it so the first Three Ages is the age of a great missionary work he said what was that he said that was honor the Lions anointing amen it was honor then the Lions anointing now you have to know that this these are the ages praise the Lord the fourth age there was the Dark Age was honor what the ox anointing right they have the anointing to walk right into death they were the bed and Bearer the stool for his name they never back off amen that was the age of persecution God put that anointing on them some of them got married right in the in their Arena before the lion will eat them they took the about kiss their loved ones say I'll see you on the other side they had the anointing to bear that amen cities and uh and Philadelphia came under the man's anointing praise the Lord it came under the man's anointing that's the reason why when you look in in the church ages you will realize that you look in history it was just about the very same time where the printing press was born right praise the Lord now laudisha Church age is on the ego's anointing War to call a people out the ego's anointing comes on loudish your Edge and cry Revelation 18 4 come out of all my people to call a people out so you see and what all of this is doing God in every age is guiding the people back to the Tree of Life guiding the people back to the true word of God when Paul and and and and and and all of those men Arenas in the in the in the in the first three Ages were were carrying our missionary work they were putting the people back to to the to the word pointing the people back to the word so you see that is the anointing of the cherubings that's their same anointing they are stood in the Garden of Eden is the same anointing that has come on the church but the work is changed now is to call the people back to God are we together and don't forget my emphasis my emphasis is only the word can do it church program will never do it we can come up with different programs let's let's do this program Let's do ribbing let's let's do uh let's say a flower it will never do it the only thing that would bring people back to the world the only thing that will line up our home is the word the only thing that will strengthen our church is the word amen the only thing that was strengthened our individual life is the word men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God praise the Lord Barbarian said you want to start anything he says stop with the word if you don't start with the word you will have trouble because the word is the original seed that we bring forth of its kind are we together I'm trying to use this and uh and and and and and try to wrap this whole thing up because uh uh just like I said I want to get back to to Paul a prisoner we went the weight of Paul and Apostle that's what took us into the gifts and and Paul at seven of Jesus Christ the purpose of the ministering is to save amen you are called as an apostle you are sin that's your office your office is an apostle your job duty is to self praise the Lord your office is Sons and Daughters of God your duty that God called you is to self praise the Lord so if you sit there and think that because you have the office now so you're the one that's supposed to be self you get it wrong praise the Lord you get it completely wrong are we together it's just like I was running on the trail map when I talked so fast just now amen I want for us to look at this let's look at this this promise over there what is man that died of mindful of him and the son of man that thou visited him now you see there the the worst son of man came in that prophecy that is something I want for us to look at because the way David said it that is a very strong prophecy very very strong is so deep I was looking at there yesterday was telling and I took the word visit what is man that thou visited him praise the Lord now if you look at that it's a it's a Hebrew word and is supposed to be pronounced Paul Carter that hope is the right pronunciation but uh uh you know Hebrew you have to know how to make your tongue to stick up in your mouth and for you to hold your worst I don't know how to do that but it says here that uh primarily root the root of that word to visit it could be friendly or hostile intent so what does it give you the idea there is that God visit his people friendly by blessing them and he also visited with joshmin now so if you go back in the Bible which of course will look at some few few verses here to be able to lay that down let it out so you can understand it what is man that thou visited him in a man you are mindful of him and the son of man that thou visited him and so you you will realize that the Bible says when he uh descended he that ascended descended first and he ascended of heart and he gave gifts to man praise the Lord amen so when he gives to man in one sense what God was doing he was visiting us you see that's the reason why we want to be sure of The Giver before the gift amen we want to be sure of The Giver are we together because you will see over and over in the scripture as we as we were studied together uh this morning if we can run quickly and look at Psalm 106 verse 4. Remember Me Oh Lord wave the favor that thou beareth upon the people oh visit me where visit me with thy salvation amen now keep that scripture in your mind look at another one that that we that we that we read all the time that second Corinthians chapter six second Corinthians chapter six keep that in in your mind now and see and see how beautiful these these two uh uh scripture were kind of a line of you are we together second Corinthians chapter six you know because when you look at this principle about Lord uh uh uh you know Savior and Lord Brothers since the people don't want him to be Lord to rule over them they just want God to be an Aaron born when we have a need oh Lord help me oh Lord help me praise the Lord you will understand it there that's that is the reason why uh uh uh churches has been run like a casino Center people go in and they think that if they cash in a lot of Praise or they cash in a lot of shouting they can cash our blessing they don't work out like that the church is not a casino are we together now second Corinthians chapter 2 chapter 6 verse 2 listening to this the Bible says uh verse 2 for he said I have heard thee in the in a Time acceptable and in the day of salvation have have a circled thee behold now is the acceptable time behold now is the day of salvation what do you hear when you hear now is the day of salvation it sounds as the same as is the day of visitation praise the Lord so the day that God saved you he visited you praise the Lord it was a day of visitation he came down to visit you praise the Lord he knocked at your door and you open the door praise the Lord and he came in and you welcome him praise the Lord so that's the same year where the Sami is saying yeah he says oh visit me oh visit me with that salvation the day of salvation is your day of visitation praise the Lord amen and when you take this over to the bulk of Sons of Solomon sons of Solomon in chapter 5 he he described a visitation of the bridegroom when he came and he was knocking the door the bride got so busy she was looking at all the gifts that he had given her and she didn't open the door and he went she had to go outside in the dark and start looking for him that's why some people never get settled they never get settled they never get settled they want to move to this church when they get there they want this other Pastor they want they never get settled because why you are mad you are not entertaining this visitation you are not recognizing your day of visitation you are just rejoicing in the in the in the moon in the movement and and you know and the emotion that is taking place oh praise God that was a beautiful old man we enjoyed that you didn't see the visitation what is man that you are mindful of and that you visit him are we together Let's uh let's let's take few here uh look at this also Genesis 21 Genesis 21 Genesis 21. brother Brown would take this he would take this here in a message is there anything too high for the Lord why Abraham he would take this he says why Abraham uh went to meet them he turned them aside and said come in and sit down talking to those angels that came to visit Sid honor the the little the the sit under the ox a little wide and let me fetch a little water and you wash your feet and I will give you mussels of bread and just rest a little while then you you may go on your way oh when he sat him down there though they didn't look any different from any other man because they were dressed dust on their clothes and come from some other country probably their feet Dusty and their clothes wrecked but Abraham knew inside there there was something real as Spirit declare a why he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere all the time that he could recognize right from wrong all the time that's the way the church the Christian ought to do today is keep yourself prayed up on a spiritual atmosphere never seen by side look to the good side you are you are children of God expecting his Blessing after he stopped them I can see him run run in and grab Sarah by the hand and said come inside darling just a moment I want to tell you something I believe I believe we are getting our day of visitation right now what the Bible says he entertained him praise the Lord he wanted to keep that presence he wanted to keep their presence sometimes we be we we behave as if that this virtue are they are our personal property we went to buy them you see people boasting in prayer life Boston in the in the world I mean the Lord had raised my Revelation and and all of that it is not yours God is just visiting you he's just visiting you and your attitude matters when the Lord is dealing with your heart and he's giving you Grace where he's drawing you inside you can spend some time with him entertain that acknowledge that he's the one doing it don't make it or seem like Lord I'm giving myself to you Lord I'm I'm surrounding myself you have nothing to do with it praise the Lord remember when brother Branham refused to go to the Pentecostal people in the early part of his ministry he said he went six months with no visitation of the Lord no vision he was just preaching like every preacher and I mean he was going to church but I mean when you are having a moment people that have spent time with God you have been in the present with God you have gone in the chamber before when you are having a visitation you know it you know it is different it's not an ordinary life it's different [Music] it's not something that you are making up and you want for people to notice praise the Lord I believe we are getting our day of visitation right now out through the herb he went he got a little card he dressed it and he brought it out and he fed them and that that was what the Apostle referred to when he said entertain strangers you might be entertaining angels that was the scripture he was referring for but let's look at Genesis chapter 21 verse 1 Genesis 21 verse 1. I'm trying to go here I'm doing well is uh uh 12. 33 amen 12 33. when do you want me to stop just let me know praise the Lord if you see right now and I would say just walk out but also I pray now not a whole year long I've been I've been trying to train myself and I'm not I'm not becoming successful so just pray for me Genesis chapter 21 verse 1 listen to this listen to this listen to this very carefully because it's not the same it is not the same and the law visited Sarah as he have said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he has spoken it's not the same it's not the same two things took place what was the two things the changing of the body and the promised son the changing of the body was her personal visitation the Lord visited Sarah are we together the law of visitor how she was an adult woman 90 something years old and Yara said she's bouncing all like a young girl praise the Lord putting up some move that even a bit like can loss after her praise the Lord lost him after his grandmother the Lord visited Sarah as he have said our countdown I will come down it was God himself changing the body he visited a serum and the Lord did unto Sarah as he have spoken two different things two things took place the changing of the body and she receiving the promised seed two different things are we together what is man what is man that you are mindful of him and the son of man that you visited him praise the Lord amen God's mind what is in his mind is is how how he can how he can come close how how he can visit us and we know our visitation in this in this uh in this age is a changing of the body just like Sarah true we have we have promised that we will receive above the change are we together and we will receive the promised son which will be Christ in Bride form we will experience the very same thing here Genesis 21 1 we go into experience that we will have a bothered change we will have a nature change there is a token life that was struck in and it would be Christ having the preeminence in our church Christ having the preeminence in our home Christ having the preeminence in our life we will not be driven by Ambitions listening to our part of prison of listening carefully as we play that tip you see how brother Branham is teaching on that we will now be driving by Ambitions and driven by career and driven by finances and driven by the uh uh uh uh uh political opinions it will be Christ in you the hope of glory are we together two different things he visits here and he did unto Sarah two different things they are not the same yeah give me some few minutes here I just want to for us to be able to cap this Exodus chapter four I said a chapter four I have a few quotes behind all of these but I'll try to to spare you if I can paraphrase them I would do Etc 4 verse 31 and the people believe praise the Lord when they heard that the Lord have visited the children of Israel how did he did how did he visited them how we come down that's what he said to Moses I will come down I will come down so it was a visitation it was a visitation whenever God comes down it's a visitation when the Lord comes down in your health it's a visitation amen when he comes down you are dealing with a situation and God comes down and give you a word don't fuss with it all you are doing you just driving him out that's all you're doing you're just driving him out why because you have your mind so set praise the Lord if he does not meet what is in your mind or you don't want it are we together amen see the visitation of entity mama God visited her now with her favorite pastor amen she asked God for an Elijah God never sinned I mean they are they are God never send her favorite pastor even in such a time like that yeah and she never she never she never even asked a guessing question are you a preacher why because he's a white man are you a preacher why are you doing in this community in the first place no she was on an expectation she said person it was brother Brandon that was surprised brother Brandon was the one that was caught off guard because he was just going and he didn't know where he was going when the woman said passion he looked behind him who was she talking to how did you know I'm a person she said I've just been reading I just been looking in the word I found a place that identified my condition I'm a woman just like that that that woman I have a son her son was there mine is dying the only thing that is missing is an Elijah are we together God visited the children of Israel you look over in sin Luke chapter one Simon did uh uh uh dedicating Jesus bless the Lord of Israel for he have visited and redeemed his people so I'm only reading visitation on one side because when we read visitation It was friendly or hostile the Hostile part is judgment I don't think we want it amen I don't think we want it because God is about visiting the Nations God is about visiting the Nations praise the Lord it is just it is just things for for for for we the illest to wake up to that and realize that our God is on the move praise the Lord we just we just we just need we just need the Lord amen we just need the Lord uh both are the the the [Music] the wheat basket of the word uh Ukraine and Russia with everything that is going on now is is going to tell on the prices of food amen and that is beginning to shake all the nations because there is there is there is uh a lot of involvement is is dropping on uh on on on Africa as much as it is dropping on Europe are we together now in Luke chapter 19 this is one of the the famous one that we know Luke chapter 19 Jesus was speaking to Israel speaking to Jerusalem amen Luke chapter 19. let me let me take it from somewhere I'm I'm closing up right here I just wanted for you uh I hope that you you were able to to see what we are talking about amen I hope that you were able to grab it Jesus here talking to to Israel 43 he says 1943 Luke 19 43 for the day shall come upon thee they have an enemy shaka's attention about thee and compass uh uh the round and keep the in on every side so this was a visitation when Titus surrounded the city for the fall and Chalet the evening wave the ground and that children with indeed and they shall not leave in the one stone upon another because they are nowhere not the time of that visitation amen so you see when the friendly visitation is refused then the Hostile visitation comes when you refuse God friendly visitation then he brings the visitation of Correction are we together yeah so what what actually that I want us to to see to be able to cap this is that uh when God brings his word even when you look at the son of man Ministry you know we can go right into that the son of man Ministry is a visitation God visiting visiting a generation with a Ministry amen with a Ministry manifesting the same work that he did to the Jews the same work that he did to the Samaritans he's bringing that same thing to us the Gentile it's a visitation amen it's not it's not something for a copycat you will never have another one praise the Lord you won't have another one you know it's a visitation so that's that's what I want us to be able to understand that's what I want us to see is that uh you know like like brother Branham said you know if if uh you know a God can visit us in different ways you know in in different ways praise the Lord what is man that you are mindful of him and the son of man that you visited him visited him God visit us in different ways praise the Lord amen like the Bible says uh you know after salvation the good and that's good thing that God gave to man is a woman it's a visitation when God gave you a good Godly wife praise the Lord because when things are approached by the word then you can now be able to to rightly function as a man in the same place also when God gave a woman a Godly husband praise the Lord it's a visitation praise the Lord when God gave us uh you know men that would be able to bring the word not in a legalistic way but in a way where we can be able to see ourselves like that little boy looking at himself in the mirror and say that's me that's a visitation you see as a church that's the reason why you know why uh uh we we we entertain Ministries to come you know to to be able to speak we want to be right there on the word praise the Lord if anybody comes speaking their own thoughts something that is not a calling to the word if we can't get them behind the pulpit because we don't want to destroy their influence before the people who set them down and say look this is not the word I don't see it like this sometimes we don't do it before the people because we don't want to destroy that person influence unless the person is stubborn then we will bring you right before the congregation and we'll treat you according to what the scripture says because the purpose is to lead us back to the word that's that's all we want to achieve that is the thing that has the absolute year that's the thing that has the absolute that's why we come here for amen if it is just a concept then we would just sing all through the service why can't we have singing service because singing is not the absolute right all of those things are just to create an atmosphere so the world can come that's why we want the right kind of for music if God can help us with it the right kind of for songs if God can help us with it amen not just pulling everything from from the internet that moves the body we want to sing songs that can that can that we can be able to catch a promise in a song the word is working mightily I mean I mean that was my team son the entire week because it's the word is the word people that realize that it's the word it's not our ideas it's not our feelings it's the word if we don't narrow it down to the word we I mean we will just miss the Mac that's what sin is to miss the mark that's what unbelief is to miss the Mac are we together am I am I am I honest too yeah but Peter said this First Peter chapter 2 verse 12 he says having your conversation Earnest which means having an Earnest Behavior among the Gentiles among the unbelievers that whereas they speak evil they speak against you as an evil Doer that they are they made by your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation praise the Lord so you see that's how the sins will judge the word it is not that we will just sit down there and say yeah you come here you are not good to me no God is going to use the earnest life you live right in the community and then when he brings them up it's just going to flash to their mind you have no excuse if a young woman was living pure to the world why were you running around and and living filthy right right so Paul says I mean Peter is saying in a day of visitation which of course this can be in the time of judgment God is going to use your testimony your earnest testimony your earners Behavior praise the Lord amen they asked Jesus they say sir we shall we shall the Commandment is the greatest say oh Israel love the Lord your God with all of your heart your mind your strength Israel God is one Lord loving with all of your heart that's the first commandment the second commandment love your neighbor as yourself foreign there's a big thing in there because Jesus was talking about the Samaritans when he when he went into death so to the Jews and the Pharisees that was around it was abominable but the mystery that is in there that it did not realize is that Jesus was trying to tell them that uh uh God has come to dwell with us as our neighbor why because it was God in flesh amen God had took on 16 elements and he come to the Earth among them just like a human praise the Lord so you see the thing about it there is the other you know uh it is it is not it is not uh uh uh uh you know it's it's more about how we treat the ones that are close to us amen how we treat the ones that are close to us so we're talking about this visitation the gifts in the church is God's visiting his people when God blessed one with with with a singing gift for God bless one with uh it is it is a way for God to visit his people are we together amen he says I will visit the Gentiles uh the people that sat in in darkness great light will shine and what did he choose he choose better man say a crook uh knows Jews Paul to fulfill that prophecy and make him an apostle to the Gentiles that was God's visitation in as much as Paul had a desire Paul was burning in his heart to bring this Revelation to his people but they rejected him why because they were blinded because it was time for great light to shine on us it was God visiting us people amen is what God's visiting us you think about it think about it I'm I'm close in here there's there's one uh quota left up here and then brother bam says this let me let me close up with this he said Ephesians Church age he said and the church corporate has never learned this lesson listen to this the church corporate the church word has never learned this lesson and it always says that if you don't learn from history you are bound to repeat it amen the church corporate has never learned this lesson from the from the scripture not from history every time God gave a visitation of the Holy Spirit and the people gets free every time God's free the people after the why they bound themselves right back to the very thing they came out off amen every time why because we we we take it as our Personal Achievement we take it as our Personal Achievement we start to condemn others we think that we are more spiritual now God have to speak to me yeah I hear what you say but let me pray about it let God speak to me first and then pretty soon you are just going around the circle to come right back to the same place you were is this every time God gave a gave a visitation of the Holy Ghost and the people gets free that's that's why Paul was crying to the church in galatia who have been with you for you to be bounding yourself to the same thing that God brought you out of praise the Lord always always say it's not bad it's not bad it's not bad we don't we don't want to be legalistic so now because we don't want to be legalistic then we we are running right back into the the hands to be bound by by sin amen Bound by the things we come out of you see every time God visit give the people the visitation of the Holy Ghost and and and and and and the Holy Ghost and the people gets free after the why they bound themselves right back to the very thing they come out of when when when Luther came out of of capitalism the people still free for the wine but when he died the people Simply Organized what they they thought they believe and and uh and set up their own Creeds and ideas and uh uh and everything and he says they went right back to capitalism with a very little different form and right today many lutherans are ready to go back go all the way back amen go all the way back do you think at the time that Ludo came out he would stand out for for gay bishops and now then and and all the nonsense that they have today those were men that was standing on the word trying to Def take the word from honor the domination of the state every time and it's not only there it's right here with us every time we use some of the silly things to send ourselves right back into a into a a burden of of uh of uh to enslave ourselves praise the Lord what is man that God visit or he visited us all the time sometimes in the simplest way he will come down on a Wednesday night and bless us with his word but what we do we want to take it oh that was a wonderful service and we don't go with that presence to be able to entertain his presence I tell people just like how God will bless us sometimes with spiritual life sometimes God blesses people with Finance amen he will bless you he will visit you he visits you I mean you will not make you like a Bill Gate but he will put you to the place where at least some of you about you I mean you you have a good Financial place but now what happened it's time for us to go on the shopping spree amen everything that pop up on Amazon we want it we go on the shopping spree praise the Lord I mean sometimes I I if if we would be smart enough is that uh we will because one good thing there is that God will not be indebted to any man praise the Lord you won't be indebted to any man so if you give your Finance to the Lord he's going to keep it he's going to bless it amen sometimes the Lord will visit us we go we go yes without if I'm not even I mean I don't want to think how we have a headache because you didn't sleep well so you get away headache okay that's your problem but the Lord visit us we enjoy good health amen we enjoy good health you want to put it on your diet there are some people that are on better diet than you and they are still struggling just to be able to identify that moment of your visitation I say Lord I know you are the one I know you are here praise the Lord I know you are here brother Brandon said when he got lost up there in Colorado musicians you can come up one or two man I wanted to finish before one o'clock okay okay I lost too many come up music you should be happy I'm not carrying you to 130 today praise the Lord amen so that let me bash myself but you please praise me in a little bit [Laughter] oh yeah you know right there up in Colorado okay now thank you thank you I appreciate it Danny Colorado when he got lost brother Brown was bragging I'm a God I would never get lost in this place I've been up this mountain when the wind stopped blowing he couldn't even find North and South he said Lord I must admit I'm lost I can get myself out of this praise the Lord he says well let me go this direction as he was going he fed a notch in his hand he said Lord are you the one praise the Lord the Lord told him to turn around as soon as he left his hand up to praise the Lord he got a hold of a lion what is man think about it that way what is man that God is mine for what is on his mind is to visit you God wants to visit you every day he don't want a seasonal visit he want to come in your home where he can feel so pleased to stay praise the Lord but what versator will be happy with you if you just leave him alone give him the remote let he just switch the the China on the TV and you are out shopping you are going about everything I don't have a place to stay we want to stay in your house a person that really want to visit and commune with you they will want your presence they don't want to want the fool you give them they don't only want the nice thing that is in your heart they want your presence they want you to be there with them that's what is on God's mind right from the beginning that's why he made man so he can leave his self-existing State and come down and dwell with men that's why God became man because what is on his mind is to visit his people he told Israel I would make you a kingdom of priests I would dwell in your mess [Music] that's what is on the father's mind to be able to visit with us oh yeah okay I know you get you get you get work I know you got to take care of your children I know you get school things to do but can you find a time for him [Music] can you find a
