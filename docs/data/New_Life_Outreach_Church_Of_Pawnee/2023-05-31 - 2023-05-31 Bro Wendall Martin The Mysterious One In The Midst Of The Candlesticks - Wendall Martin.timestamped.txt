[40:23] can the Church Say Amen
[40:26] and a man he is so so wonderful and we
[40:32] love him here tonight
[40:34] amen good to see everyone here amen
[40:38] that's come on a Wednesday night and I
[40:41] know Wednesdays can be a little tough
[40:42] you've been working all day and
[40:44] and
[40:47] you know then you you sisters haven't
[40:50] you've got your you got you've got to
[40:52] get your babies all all ready and and uh
[40:56] it's hard to get three or four kids all
[40:59] all and all together for a Wednesday
[41:01] night and uh uh so we always think and I
[41:07] think the Lord for even for for you
[41:09] families amen you young families with
[41:12] with these uh bringing your kids to
[41:14] church and being faithful uh every
[41:17] Wednesday night I tell you what amen I I
[41:21] I
[41:22] someone someone says well you know I I I
[41:26] I just don't feel like coming tonight I
[41:29] said well what about those girls that uh
[41:31] any mind have to feed their husbands and
[41:34] their families and then
[41:36] amen bring all of those youngins to
[41:38] church they don't feel like coming
[41:40] neither Hallelujah and so I I'm just
[41:44] glad I think God gives a a special
[41:47] blessing Amen on these Wednesday nights
[41:50] when you when you come and
[41:53] um with that extra effort amen amen it's
[41:56] good to good to have brother Merle and
[41:58] sister Leah back home and and
[42:02] um we sure have missed them around here
[42:06] and uh just just good to see uh everyone
[42:11] uh back I I see Brothers I think brother
[42:14] Joe and them were going this last
[42:16] weekend and I was too amen so
[42:20] but we had uh uh we had a wonderful
[42:25] Services there in in Bentley Kansas and
[42:29] and the Lord was just really sweet and
[42:31] so we're so proud for that church amen
[42:35] let's look here in Revelations the first
[42:38] chapter
[42:39] and um
[42:41] amen
[42:43] um
[42:43] we'll start at the 10th verse
[42:47] and so
[42:49] um
[42:50] we dealt this last
[42:54] um
[42:54] Wednesday you know just just going over
[42:58] some scriptures uh on Amen the the
[43:02] beauty of the invisible God
[43:06] becoming a human being
[43:09] the beauty this is this is this is
[43:12] incredible the story of redemption is
[43:16] incredible
[43:17] and um and so
[43:20] um
[43:21] I think that it's that it's important to
[43:24] catch that because as we go into the
[43:26] church ages we are now finding that God
[43:30] the invisible God the Lord amen Jehovah
[43:34] is Lord he become he he came in flesh
[43:40] Jesus Christ that Earthly name amen but
[43:44] now today he is living through the
[43:48] church ages on Earth not not in the body
[43:53] of Jesus Christ here on Earth he is now
[43:56] living in the the mystical body of Jesus
[44:01] Christ here on Earth so now Jesus is
[44:03] still he's got a body he'll forevermore
[44:05] have that body as we uh how many how
[44:08] many uh got anything out of the last
[44:10] Wednesday night service amen that body
[44:13] will all that's the body of God but now
[44:15] here on Earth his spirit is coming now
[44:20] living through to the holy spirit in you
[44:23] and in me amen and so as we go through
[44:27] these we want to see these things and
[44:31] and enjoy these Mysteries of the Lord so
[44:35] here in Revelations 1 and 10.
[44:39] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[44:41] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[44:43] a trumpet
[44:44] saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first and
[44:48] the last what thou seeest write in a
[44:51] book and send it into the seven churches
[44:54] which are in Asia unto Ephesus into
[44:57] Smyrna and to pergamus unto thytera unto
[45:01] Sardis unto Philadelphia and unto
[45:04] laodicea and I turned to see the voice
[45:06] that spake with me and being turned I
[45:11] saw seven golden candlesticks and in the
[45:13] midst of the candlesticks one like unto
[45:17] the son of man clothed with a garment
[45:19] down to the foot
[45:21] gerd about the paps with the golden
[45:23] girdle his head and his hair were white
[45:27] like wool it has white as snow his eyes
[45:30] were as flames of fire his feet like
[45:33] under brass fine brass as if they burned
[45:37] in a furnace and his voice has the sound
[45:39] of many Waters and he had in his right
[45:42] hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth
[45:45] when a sharpened two-edged sword and his
[45:49] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[45:53] his strength amen we asked the Lord's
[45:56] blessings upon the word you can be
[45:59] seated here tonight
[46:00] amen we
[46:03] um I want to deal with just a few
[46:07] just a few things here
[46:09] um and we might not get through the
[46:11] whole verse but I'd like to just go
[46:12] through the the the different
[46:14] characteristics of this of this one that
[46:17] is in the in the fire or or that is seen
[46:20] in the golden candlesticks and so
[46:24] um if we can deal with you know the five
[46:25] verses that's dealing with that then
[46:27] that would be wonderful but we might not
[46:29] get to all of that I know it's a
[46:31] Wednesday night and
[46:33] um and so uh we but we want to to deal
[46:37] with the voice
[46:39] and and and the candlesticks and the one
[46:42] in the midst of the candlesticks I would
[46:44] I definitely want to try to to just talk
[46:47] about those here this evening and and I
[46:50] would like for it to be sort of like um
[46:52] as we did the other night if you have
[46:54] any questions or anything you want to
[46:56] add
[46:57] um we we're going to do this for a while
[46:59] uh in a Bible study type setting
[47:02] um I I wish I had me a little Podium or
[47:05] something where I could just be right
[47:06] down among you and we'd all squeeze in
[47:08] together and where where we felt like we
[47:10] were in a living room or something but
[47:13] um but I I I think that it's a it's a
[47:17] wonderful thing in these with these
[47:19] types
[47:20] and so I he said and I turned
[47:25] um to see and if you look there in that
[47:27] in that 12th verse I turn to see The
[47:31] Voice
[47:32] that spake with me now amen I want you
[47:36] to notice he didn't turn to see the one
[47:39] whose voice spoke amen whose voice he
[47:43] heard he turned to see the voice now you
[47:47] might think that that is just a a
[47:50] translation
[47:52] um uh error amen but that's not a
[47:55] translation error if you if you look it
[47:57] up a man in the Greek amen the voice and
[48:01] the person is the self-same thing Jesus
[48:05] is the word amen Jesus Is God and so
[48:10] when you ever really see the word then
[48:13] you'll see Christ you'll see Jesus uh
[48:17] wherever the word is now they're they're
[48:20] in in Saint John 1 and 1 it says in the
[48:24] beginning was the word the word was with
[48:27] God the Word was God Amen so you'll
[48:32] never be able to separate God from his
[48:35] word he says the same was in the
[48:38] beginning with God all things were made
[48:41] by him and without him was not anything
[48:45] made that was made so so I want us to as
[48:49] we as we deal here tonight with this one
[48:52] that is in the midst of the candlesticks
[48:54] amen I want you to to look at this one
[48:58] as as we as we talk tonight as the
[49:02] living word amen that's the Living Word
[49:05] now the scholars and I don't want to go
[49:07] uh too deep into it tonight but amen the
[49:11] the the the the
[49:12] uh the Greek word for in the beginning
[49:16] was the word it is the logos of God Amen
[49:20] that's the that is the thoughts of God
[49:23] becoming word amen so God had his
[49:27] thoughts in the back of his mind forever
[49:31] amen
[49:32] and then and then when God spoke amen
[49:37] what happened when God spoke Hallelujah
[49:40] now then God became visible so we had
[49:45] the invisible God that filled all spaces
[49:48] all time he had there was you can't get
[49:52] you can't get below God you can't get
[49:54] above God and and again the other night
[49:56] as we were talking about the one on the
[49:58] throne amen how can you get on the right
[50:01] side of an invisible God Amen so God
[50:05] uses these types amen so that you and I
[50:09] can see so here's the one setting with
[50:11] the book in his right hand and here
[50:13] comes the lamb it is showing that God
[50:16] was going to build himself a body so
[50:20] that he could come and do the work of a
[50:23] Kinsmen Redeemer amen you cannot get on
[50:26] the you cannot get it above beneath the
[50:30] one side or the other of the invisible
[50:33] God can you say Amen but yet when God
[50:37] spoke let's just take let's just take
[50:39] this here amen uh for for for uh
[50:43] instance here
[50:45] praise the Lord hey I appreciate uh
[50:50] oh I don't know if y'all can see that
[50:52] amen
[50:54] Hallelujah
[50:57] so so let's put this let's put this
[51:00] easel or let's let's put this uh this
[51:03] deal here
[51:04] man this is God
[51:07] you can't get around him he's just
[51:09] there's nothing but God
[51:12] yeah come on over here some empty seats
[51:15] on this side of the building Hallelujah
[51:17] and um you can't you can't see God
[51:21] but God was there invisible for all
[51:25] eternity God is nature God is God is the
[51:29] breath God is God is God God is
[51:32] invisible God is there's there's there's
[51:34] not even oxygen there's nothing amen
[51:39] there's nothing but God
[51:42] and God had these Minds it's these
[51:44] thoughts in the back of his mind Amen in
[51:48] his mind forever
[51:50] he thought of the world he thought of
[51:53] you he wanted to be a he wanted to be a
[51:56] father he wanted to he wanted to express
[52:00] himself he wanted to have a creation
[52:03] amen
[52:05] so then God spoke
[52:09] and when God spoke out of the invisible
[52:14] realm came a tangible
[52:18] form of God
[52:21] Amen in the form of a Halo
[52:26] now so the first light that was created
[52:30] the first light was not let there be
[52:34] light amen at the beginning when God
[52:36] created the Sun the first light was the
[52:41] logos
[52:42] it came out of God
[52:46] God is now living in a visible form
[52:51] now now where wherever you see amen
[52:55] where God shows the Bible says he God is
[52:59] light
[53:02] God is light so so when in the beginning
[53:07] was the logos the logos was with God the
[53:14] logos was God and the logos was made
[53:19] flesh
[53:21] hallelujah amen on the pillar of fire
[53:25] you when when in the upper room amen
[53:28] when the cloven tongues of fire came
[53:29] down amen it was this dwelling whipping
[53:34] Pillar of Fire and lexifier came off and
[53:38] hit that
[53:39] 120. amen and and embodied them it was a
[53:45] part of God being expressed
[53:49] man now I without going into amen a lot
[53:54] of theological terms amen so but God you
[53:59] see they could that he lived in this
[54:02] light
[54:04] but you see
[54:06] amen uh God wanted to come in a more
[54:10] visible form so now everything
[54:13] everything from creation is in this is
[54:17] in this light when God spoke at the
[54:19] beginning the Bible says they're in in
[54:22] Hebrews the fourth chapter The Works
[54:25] were finished from the foundation of the
[54:28] world
[54:29] it was all spoke then can you say Amen
[54:32] so the logos is the Living Word
[54:37] amen everyone say the Living Word it's
[54:40] it's not logos it's not a word on a page
[54:44] like you would read now we would read
[54:46] here and we'd see words making up a
[54:49] sentence that is not the logos the logos
[54:52] is a Living Word it is it is God's body
[54:57] that there is God that spoke and he is
[55:01] now living inside his word
[55:04] amen he's got that form now so when you
[55:09] I want us to to to uh keep that in our
[55:13] mind because it's God becoming tangible
[55:17] it's always been God's desire to become
[55:20] tangible he he come the great Pillar of
[55:24] Fire came Amen on Mount Sun a Sinai and
[55:30] God spoke out of that with the Thunders
[55:32] and the lightning and and the and the
[55:34] and the mountain was on fire that was
[55:36] God speaking it was the fire that
[55:40] appeared unto Moses there in the in the
[55:42] burning bush
[55:43] it was the fire that appeared it was it
[55:46] was the pillar of fire that led the
[55:49] children of Israel you see God becoming
[55:52] tangible
[55:53] for you and for me now I want us to keep
[55:57] that in mind as we go amen of course we
[56:00] know what the candlesticks are I'm going
[56:02] to stop for a moment on that one that is
[56:04] walking in the midst of the candlesticks
[56:06] and I want us to look at these
[56:08] candlesticks the candlesticks are not
[56:11] they men are not necessarily uh they're
[56:14] not they're not
[56:16] um
[56:17] they're not candlesticks they're lamps
[56:19] amen so they're lamps that are that are
[56:22] there
[56:23] so amen I want us to matters of fact
[56:26] let's let's just look here there was
[56:28] another prophecy concerning this back in
[56:31] Zechariah let's look at Zechariah real
[56:33] quickly and
[56:35] um I don't want to I don't want to push
[56:36] things through if there's anything that
[56:38] anyone wants to add
[56:41] um or a question make sure you ask now
[56:44] amen Zechariah 4
[56:47] and 1.
[56:49] praise the Lord
[56:52] now this here is is talking about the
[56:55] it's a prophecy of of the church ages
[56:58] that were to come
[56:59] amen and so
[57:02] um
[57:03] of course we know that the that the
[57:04] candlesticks according to Revelations 1
[57:06] and 20 says that they are the seven
[57:08] churches but Zechariah 4 and 1 it says
[57:11] the angel talked with me again came
[57:13] again and walked with me as a man that
[57:16] awakened me as a man that is awakened
[57:19] out of his sleep and he said unto me
[57:21] what seeth thou
[57:23] and I said I have looked and behold a
[57:27] Candlestick all of gold with a bowl on
[57:31] the top of it and his seven laps thereon
[57:34] and the Seven pipes to the seven lamps
[57:36] which are upon the top thereof
[57:40] and two olive trees by it one up on the
[57:43] right side of the bowl and the other
[57:45] upon the left side thereof so I spake or
[57:49] I answered and spake to the angel that I
[57:51] talked with me saying what are these my
[57:54] Lord and then the angel talked with me
[57:56] answered and saying no us thou not what
[57:58] these be I said no my Lord and he
[58:01] answered and spake unto me saying this
[58:04] is the word of the Lord undiserable
[58:06] saying not by might
[58:08] nor by power but by my spirit saith the
[58:13] Lord of the hosts can you say Amen so so
[58:16] here is what he here is what he saw
[58:24] and I don't know if I can do this
[58:30] okay so here's the stand and you got
[58:33] your you got your fire amen
[58:37] Hallelujah I'm a wonderful artist
[58:43] all right
[58:44] and then you've got then you've got two
[58:47] trees
[58:48] two olive trees oops
[58:50] amen one on either side
[58:54] okay so here's your lamp stand now amen
[58:57] here's your here's your bowl
[59:00] and I you know and then the bowl that
[59:01] that holds the the oil in it and then
[59:04] we've got then we've got
[59:06] we've got oil coming from each one of
[59:08] these olive trees now amen so you've got
[59:12] now what were these are what are these
[59:14] olive trees representing
[59:16] anybody have a guess
[59:21] I see a smile
[59:27] huh
[59:30] it's the and and the Bible says that
[59:33] they are the two witnesses all right
[59:36] it is the Old Testament
[59:40] and the New Testament
[59:42] that is supplying oil to the seven
[59:45] Church ages
[59:47] amen so their their witness these
[59:50] Witnesses amen are are the are they new
[59:54] and the old
[59:55] we are we are the Fulfillment of all of
[59:59] this and it's living through us so the
[1:00:02] oil now now these these are not
[1:00:03] candlesticks because if they were
[1:00:06] Candles there is there's the the the
[1:00:09] once the once the uh once it's it's
[1:00:13] going out it has gone out you can't use
[1:00:15] oil but you see these These are tubes
[1:00:18] that that come in
[1:00:21] um Hallelujah
[1:00:24] you guys gonna love my drone
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:29] so and they had Wicks these Wicks came
[1:00:33] from each that go down these these
[1:00:35] sticks and then they would dip into that
[1:00:37] oil that was down there in the bowl see
[1:00:40] that so you had you had all of these
[1:00:43] amen you you had all of these Wicks
[1:00:46] coming down getting the their oil from
[1:00:51] the same Bowl Amen Oil represents the
[1:00:55] Holy Spirit
[1:00:56] amen and so here we have the Old
[1:01:00] Testament the New Testament amen which
[1:01:04] is the two Divine Witnesses
[1:01:06] and each one of these church church ages
[1:01:10] are getting amen they are they are
[1:01:14] getting the same Supply as the last
[1:01:19] Church
[1:01:19] so it's not that this one the first
[1:01:22] church age oh it was a powerful they had
[1:01:26] more of the Holy Ghost the second Church
[1:01:28] age is dipped in of the Sabbath is
[1:01:32] dipped into the same Holy Ghost
[1:01:36] that the first church age was hooked
[1:01:38] into
[1:01:40] amen you you don't don't ever look back
[1:01:43] and say Amen well you know we're just in
[1:01:47] another age before the coming of the
[1:01:48] Lord and so God don't do those things
[1:01:50] anymore no God does those things
[1:01:55] Hallelujah the anointing follows the
[1:01:59] word
[1:02:02] New Testament
[1:02:04] Old Testament
[1:02:07] if you want the anointing the anointing
[1:02:12] oil has got to follow the word of God
[1:02:17] if you don't have the word then you are
[1:02:21] not in the church because the church
[1:02:25] still has everything that God ever was
[1:02:30] now you boys remembering you kids
[1:02:33] remember if we saw the dead Rays back
[1:02:36] there we'll see the dead raised here
[1:02:39] if we saw Miracles back there we can see
[1:02:43] Miracles today the only thing that would
[1:02:46] separate us is if that Wick somehow gets
[1:02:51] cut
[1:02:53] and we get off of the main line
[1:02:56] amen then this fire this fire will go
[1:03:00] out
[1:03:01] can you say man so in order
[1:03:04] hear me now yeah and that's why I always
[1:03:07] tell you young ones
[1:03:08] I don't care what you think I know
[1:03:10] you're smart I know we've got it but
[1:03:13] remember you'll never outgrow the Old
[1:03:16] Testament and the New Testament amen
[1:03:19] this is where God's anointing is can you
[1:03:23] say amen amen so how many understands
[1:03:26] that so the fire that fell on Pentecost
[1:03:29] Hallelujah did you know that the set or
[1:03:32] the candlesticks in the in in the in the
[1:03:34] tent in the Tabernacle amen they would
[1:03:37] take the they would take the the fire
[1:03:41] the flame from the original
[1:03:44] uh a fire that God lit at the beginning
[1:03:51] did you all know that God lit the fire
[1:03:53] in the Tabernacle at first it was the
[1:03:56] Holy Fire and then the the priest would
[1:03:59] come in and take that light amen this
[1:04:03] candle and they would like this
[1:04:05] and then would like this and then would
[1:04:07] like this until all of the candlesticks
[1:04:10] were lit praise the name of the Lord oh

[1:04:35] oh I want you to catch that it is Jesus
[1:04:38] Christ the same
[1:04:43] he'll always be the same and if we don't
[1:04:46] see him the same it's not his fault
[1:04:51] it's because that'll lay ought to see in
[1:04:53] church a spirit God on us that don't

[1:05:00] of nothing I don't need that light
[1:05:01] anymore
[1:05:02] I want to tell you if you're going to
[1:05:04] make a Rapture you better be connected
[1:05:06] to the Holy Spirit

[1:05:15] Hallelujah too many times we got too
[1:05:18] many things that's going on can you say
[1:05:20] Amen now in the midst of these
[1:05:23] candlesticks the Bible says that the son
[1:05:27] of man was seen in the middle of it amen
[1:05:32] he was Christ was in the midst
[1:05:37] of the candlesticks
[1:05:39] Hallelujah who is Christ we just talked
[1:05:42] about it who is Christ
[1:05:43] the word
[1:05:45] the word
[1:05:48] he's the son of man he did he didn't say
[1:05:51] it was Jesus
[1:05:53] in in between
[1:05:56] he says one like unto the son of man man
[1:06:00] it's still God but it's God living in
[1:06:06] bodies from this church age this church
[1:06:10] age this church ate it is God's spirit
[1:06:14] the logos living in flesh Among Us
[1:06:20] that's what the Holy Ghost is all about
[1:06:23] Buddy that Holy Ghost is right there
[1:06:25] amen making you empowering you amen it's
[1:06:30] God living his life in you
[1:06:34] amen there in John 1 and 14 now we just
[1:06:38] read in the beginning was the word the
[1:06:40] word was with God the Word was God Amen
[1:06:43] the world was made by that word 14th
[1:06:45] verse and the Word was made flesh and
[1:06:48] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[1:06:53] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:06:57] father full of grace and truth if the
[1:07:00] true if the church wants to see deity
[1:07:04] if the church wants to see deity it must
[1:07:09] stay with the word
[1:07:12] are you hearing me so if you want to see
[1:07:15] deity how many wants deity in your midst
[1:07:18] then you've got to stay with the
[1:07:22] revelation of the word
[1:07:24] amen he's progressively moving in each
[1:07:27] of those Church ages amen now remember
[1:07:30] Israel I want to just add this real
[1:07:32] quick Israel had to follow that logos
[1:07:36] Israel had to follow that Pillar of Fire
[1:07:40] amen so if the pillar of fire stopped I
[1:07:43] don't care if it stopped for a month
[1:07:45] they had to they had to sit there put up
[1:07:48] their tents they were to sit right there
[1:07:49] amen until that Pillar of Fire moved but
[1:07:52] when the pillar of fire moved they had
[1:07:56] to follow the pillar of Fire
[1:08:00] man and if they if they didn't follow
[1:08:03] the pillar of fire man God was no longer
[1:08:05] responsible for them when that Pillar of
[1:08:07] Fire moved there wasn't no arguing there
[1:08:10] wasn't no complaining they had to pick
[1:08:13] up and follow the pillar of fire amen
[1:08:17] can you say Amen why because the pillar
[1:08:20] of fire was taking them to the promise
[1:08:23] and the and and the and the promise that
[1:08:27] God gave them according to Exodus 23 and
[1:08:30] 20 he says I'm going to send mine Angel
[1:08:33] before you amen beware of him and obey
[1:08:37] his voice and provoke him not for my
[1:08:40] name is in him he will keep you in the
[1:08:43] way and he will bring you into that land
[1:08:47] he says I'll be an enemy to your enemies
[1:08:50] I'll be an adversary to your adversaries
[1:08:53] amen but he says I'll cut them all off
[1:08:56] as long as you're following that Pillar
[1:08:59] of Fire
[1:09:00] well praise the Lord
[1:09:02] and the pillar of fire is with us today
[1:09:10] but you've got to follow that Revelation
[1:09:13] it's the Living Word
[1:09:16] the reason why you're not content
[1:09:18] setting in a Baptist Church or a
[1:09:19] Pentecostal church or or one of these
[1:09:21] other churches there is a desire to know
[1:09:24] God in a deeper and more intimate
[1:09:26] relationship not that it's all here it's
[1:09:29] that you're you you come from him and
[1:09:32] you're you're wanting to know who you
[1:09:35] are
[1:09:36] so you've got to find who he is he's the
[1:09:39] Living Word
[1:09:42] and so are you
[1:09:44] Hallelujah
[1:09:46] can you say Amen
[1:09:48] so Jesus is not the letter on a page am
[1:09:52] I going too slow
[1:09:53] amen now Jesus is not the page or not
[1:09:58] not the letter on the page of a book he
[1:10:01] is that Living Word in the form of Flesh
[1:10:04] amen that's what he was now we went
[1:10:06] through that I think we nailed it down
[1:10:08] pretty good the other night and there's
[1:10:09] a there's a bunch more scriptures that
[1:10:11] we could use amen showing that that
[1:10:14] Christ amen that it was God building a
[1:10:18] body living in that body and dying in
[1:10:22] that body to redeem you and me
[1:10:26] for what purpose for us to come in and
[1:10:28] sing you know oh happy day for us to
[1:10:31] come in and sing Amazing Grace for us no
[1:10:34] no no he came to redeem me
[1:10:38] so that his holy spirit can now live in
[1:10:41] me
[1:10:42] amen can you say Amen now when Jesus
[1:10:46] came Israel was stuck
[1:10:49] they they were stuck in the uh the the
[1:10:53] in in in in Moses letter
[1:10:56] amen all they saw was letters written on
[1:11:01] tables of stone
[1:11:03] that's all they seem
[1:11:05] all they sing amen was the Ten
[1:11:07] Commandments all they seen is they
[1:11:09] didn't scratch that's what God was to
[1:11:11] them God is not God is not this
[1:11:17] the words that is inscribed on a page
[1:11:19] God is living
[1:11:23] living someone say he's living they were
[1:11:27] stuck with the Articles of Moses and
[1:11:30] says we believe Moses but the the living
[1:11:34] logos was now in the body of Jesus and
[1:11:38] they rejected it
[1:11:41] while hanging on
[1:11:43] to this back over here
[1:11:46] now they they they were hanging on to
[1:11:48] Moses we'd be with Moses Jesus says if
[1:11:51] you if Abraham were your faith you
[1:11:53] believe Moses should believe me
[1:11:55] amen they'd said another place well we
[1:11:59] believe Abraham we're Abraham he goes if
[1:12:01] you were Abraham's children you would
[1:12:07] wreck was something in the past whereas
[1:12:10] God was living today in a body that he
[1:12:15] had already said
[1:12:17] his word had already given all the types
[1:12:20] he had already given all and he was
[1:12:22] there fulfilling them and they couldn't
[1:12:24] see the Living God the Living Word
[1:12:29] present day in a body
[1:12:35] can I tell you something else
[1:12:37] we've got now
[1:12:38] we've got everyone talking about Jesus
[1:12:40] of yesterday
[1:12:41] and Jesus in the manger and Jesus saw
[1:12:44] and God is moving on he's got abroad a
[1:12:49] matured bride and now no one can see
[1:12:53] this now they're worshiping a god of
[1:12:56] yesterday
[1:12:58] now they've got an idol of Jesus
[1:13:02] and God is living in his word
[1:13:06] for a rapture
[1:13:09] amen
[1:13:12] can you say Amen now watch
[1:13:15] now Israel was stuck they were stuck and
[1:13:17] Jesus reminds them here what's this he
[1:13:20] says there in John 5 and 36 I have
[1:13:23] greater witness than John than that of
[1:13:24] John
[1:13:26] for The Works which the father hath
[1:13:27] given me to finish the same works I do
[1:13:30] bear witness of me that the father have
[1:13:33] sent me and the father himself hath sent
[1:13:37] me which has sent me hath borne witness
[1:13:39] of me you have neither heard his voice
[1:13:43] at any time nor seen his shape ye have
[1:13:47] not his word
[1:13:48] abiding in you
[1:13:51] for whom he had sent him ye believe not
[1:13:56] now he's talking to these Pharisees that
[1:14:00] are clinging to Moses and he's telling
[1:14:02] them now you've neither heard his voice
[1:14:08] and you're not seeing his shape
[1:14:11] I'm here
[1:14:13] and you won't recognize it
[1:14:18] he says you have neither heard his voice
[1:14:20] nor seen his shape and you have not his
[1:14:24] word abiding in you for whom he hath
[1:14:27] sent him you believe not
[1:14:31] search the scriptures for in them you
[1:14:35] Pharisees think you have eternal life
[1:14:37] and they are the ones that testify of me
[1:14:43] now here they are they're over there
[1:14:46] they're over there Moses said Hallelujah
[1:14:48] Moses said Hallelujah more Abraham
[1:14:51] Hallelujah and Jesus is saying hey
[1:14:54] goofballs
[1:14:55] I'm not in that
[1:14:58] I'm here
[1:15:00] I'm here
[1:15:03] you're not hearing his voice you're not
[1:15:05] seeing his shape
[1:15:10] and the Very scriptures that you are
[1:15:13] reading and claiming that you have
[1:15:15] eternal life are the very scriptures
[1:15:17] that tell you
[1:15:19] who I am
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:23] ah can you say Amen you see it takes
[1:15:27] divine revelation now this one that is
[1:15:32] walking in the midst of the candlesticks
[1:15:34] it's that Living Word it is God's word
[1:15:40] speaking revealing himself to each one
[1:15:44] of the churches throughout the Seven
[1:15:47] Ages it is God revealing himself in a
[1:15:51] different manner coming closer amen
[1:15:54] bringing that Bride on into maturity can
[1:15:56] you say Amen so the fifth age can't look
[1:15:58] back to the to the fourth age and say
[1:16:00] well no no no no no it's God bringing a
[1:16:03] mature blood until we come to this age
[1:16:06] and there is a bride without spot
[1:16:08] wrinkle or blemish
[1:16:10] the word has come we'll praise the Lord
[1:16:15] I love it
[1:16:17] I love it search the scriptures for in
[1:16:19] them you think you have eternal life and
[1:16:22] they are they which testify of me
[1:16:26] so Jesus will always be the Living Word
[1:16:29] all right
[1:16:31] questions and answers
[1:16:33] Hallelujah
[1:16:36] any questions
[1:16:39] huh
[1:16:41] now we've done this that one Sunday
[1:16:43] night and and then uh Austin said man
[1:16:45] right back at the very beginning I just
[1:16:47] started writing down questions because
[1:16:49] you'd already lost me amen
[1:16:52] I pick on Austin because I know a bunch
[1:16:54] of other ones said the same thing amen
[1:16:55] so
[1:16:58] amen y'all understand that
[1:17:01] you you understand the logos of God the
[1:17:04] invisible God God speaks light appears
[1:17:08] the Bible says he dwells we ain't got
[1:17:11] time to go through all that but he
[1:17:13] dwells in that light
[1:17:15] he dwells in that light
[1:17:17] it's not two Gods but it is God in a
[1:17:22] physical form in the form of a light
[1:17:28] it was God slowly Hallelujah and you
[1:17:30] know what the prophet said about you he
[1:17:32] says when God created you he created you
[1:17:35] in His image he says so if he is like a
[1:17:37] hate if he's the Halo he says a Son of
[1:17:41] God would be something like a cloud your
[1:17:44] spirit represents that Hallelujah
[1:17:49] because you come from the same image
[1:17:51] that God came the word image all right I
[1:17:54] gotta go all right let's let's keep on
[1:17:55] going here now
[1:17:57] amen so now I want you to understand
[1:17:59] what he was in that first age he'll
[1:18:03] forevermore be someone say Amen
[1:18:06] it's no wonder Jesus said the works that
[1:18:08] I do
[1:18:10] shall you do
[1:18:12] because it's the same spirit that lived
[1:18:17] in him that is living in that church
[1:18:20] now
[1:18:22] the church is not candlesticks the
[1:18:25] church is you
[1:18:27] the candlesticks represent you
[1:18:30] the oil
[1:18:32] represents the Holy Spirit
[1:18:34] can you say Amen
[1:18:36] now watch
[1:18:39] if the price for Redemption has been
[1:18:40] paid let's look here at Romans 8 and 9.
[1:18:42] amen
[1:18:44] now Jesus is saying the works that I do
[1:18:46] so you do Greater Works than these shall
[1:18:50] you do I've got to pay the price of
[1:18:52] redemption
[1:18:53] I've got to return to the heavens but
[1:18:55] the same spirit that dwells in me is
[1:18:58] going to dwell in you I am now free I am
[1:19:02] now released
[1:19:04] to live in you sin has been taken care
[1:19:07] of so let's look here Romans 8 and 9.
[1:19:10] but if ye but ye are not in the flesh
[1:19:12] but in the spirit if so be uh that the
[1:19:16] spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[1:19:19] man have not the spirit of Christ he is
[1:19:22] none of his
[1:19:23] if and if Christ be in you
[1:19:27] amen the body is dead because of sin the
[1:19:31] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:19:33] but if the spirit of him if somebody say
[1:19:37] the same spirit
[1:19:39] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[1:19:43] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:19:47] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:19:50] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:19:54] dwelleth in you so now you're quickened
[1:19:56] now the scripture says there in verse
[1:19:58] Corinthians 12 and 1 for by one Spirit
[1:20:02] are we all baptized into one body that's
[1:20:05] that word body amen whether we be jew or
[1:20:08] Gentiles whether it be Bond or free and
[1:20:11] have been made to drink
[1:20:13] into that one Spirit somebody say one
[1:20:17] spirit
[1:20:19] what spirit
[1:20:21] The Same Spirit
[1:20:23] that raised Christ from the dead
[1:20:26] the very not not the not the second
[1:20:29] person of the godhead or not the third
[1:20:31] person of the godhead but God himself
[1:20:34] living the same spirit that was in
[1:20:39] Christ is now in you
[1:20:42] and that's another one that I was was
[1:20:43] talking about the other night amen
[1:20:44] either you know as we just we just got
[1:20:47] through Reading during in Romans 8 9 it
[1:20:49] says the spirit of God dwell in you but
[1:20:51] if you have not the spirit of Christ
[1:20:53] you're none of his but if Christ be in
[1:20:56] you body is dead because of sin the
[1:20:58] spirit is life because of righteous it's
[1:21:00] all interchangeable
[1:21:03] because now God is forevermore he is
[1:21:07] forevermore in that body of Jesus Christ
[1:21:12] amen
[1:21:14] now
[1:21:15] all right
[1:21:18] you love him
[1:21:21] Luke Luke 4 and 1. let's let's turn

[1:21:41] about here

[1:21:49] person of the godhead
[1:21:52] no no no
[1:21:53] Jesus being full of the father because
[1:21:57] he did say the father dwelleth in me so
[1:22:00] it's got to be the no okay great let's
[1:22:02] do this again Jesus being full
[1:22:06] of the

[1:22:12] that baptizes you into one body
[1:22:18] come on Saints
[1:22:20] we're not talking about three we're
[1:22:22] talking about God building a body and
[1:22:26] living in it
[1:22:29] Jesus being full
[1:22:33] of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:35] amen I love it amen now now I want you

[1:22:42] spirit of a word those of you that

[1:22:46] lot of scriptures up there and and I
[1:22:48] think it's worth going back and
[1:22:49] listening to but Jesus is the or the uh
[1:22:53] amen the spirit of the word
[1:22:56] the logos
[1:22:58] is walking
[1:23:00] through the midst of the candlesticks
[1:23:03] the logos of God Amen Hallelujah
[1:23:08] it's that Spirit of the word it's the
[1:23:11] anointing it's the theophany of God it's
[1:23:14] they they have they have a lot of uh of
[1:23:17] theological things that they that they
[1:23:19] call that logos but it's the Living Word
[1:23:23] looking for bodies
[1:23:25] to express themselves in
[1:23:28] can you say Amen

[1:23:55] which establishes US with you in Christ
[1:24:00] and hath anointed us

[1:24:15] earnest of the spirit you know in our
[1:24:18] hearts all right
[1:24:21] now as we talk about this this this one
[1:24:23] in the midst of the candlesticks let me
[1:24:25] just ask
[1:24:26] how many believes the church is powerful
[1:24:29] amen I believe the church is powerful
[1:24:33] you see because it's the one holy spirit
[1:24:36] of God the same holy ghost that anointed
[1:24:38] Jesus is the same Holy Ghost That Came
[1:24:41] Upon you at the new birth
[1:24:43] now you will never be an expression
[1:24:48] of what's here you'll never be an
[1:24:51] expression your light will never shine
[1:24:53] until you become born again until you
[1:24:57] get all of the clogs out of your system
[1:25:01] so that the oil can go all the way up
[1:25:03] and burn through your life
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:07] Jesus did their their Nicodemus came to
[1:25:09] Jesus and he says hey we know the
[1:25:11] Miracles that you've done we know you're
[1:25:13] a man of God all the Miracles and and
[1:25:15] and and it's and he's got to if you were
[1:25:17] to read John 3 and the first chapter on
[1:25:20] on down but I'm going to break in here
[1:25:22] at the third verse and he said John 3
[1:25:24] and 3 Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:25:27] verily verily I say unto you
[1:25:31] except a manly born again
[1:25:34] he cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:25:36] Nicodemus says unto him
[1:25:39] how can a man be born when he is old can
[1:25:42] he enter the second time into his
[1:25:43] mother's womb and be born Jesus answered
[1:25:47] verily verily I say unto you accept a
[1:25:50] man be born of water and of spirit he
[1:25:53] cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[1:25:54] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:25:58] that which is born of the spirit is
[1:26:01] Spirit Marvel not that I say unto you
[1:26:04] that you must be born again
[1:26:08] why is it that the church
[1:26:10] that is claiming themselves to be the
[1:26:13] church is not producing the life of God
[1:26:16] because they're not born okay
[1:26:20] Jesus was the Virgin born son of God
[1:26:27] what is the second birth what is the new
[1:26:31] birth what does it mean to be born again
[1:26:33] you are a virgin born son or daughter of
[1:26:39] God
[1:26:42] praise the Lord
[1:26:46] now how could Jesus be the Virgin born
[1:26:48] because he was the word predestinated
[1:26:52] word that was spoke
[1:26:54] and God came in and I believe when God
[1:26:57] spoke the word at the beginning he also
[1:26:59] knew the woman he knew the womb that it
[1:27:01] was going to be
[1:27:02] when God said a virgin shall conceive
[1:27:05] amen he already knew their name was
[1:27:07] going to be Mary
[1:27:09] because Jesus that was well let's just
[1:27:11] let's just look here real quickly amen
[1:27:13] and then we we won't hold you real long
[1:27:15] tonight let's look at Jesus for a minute
[1:27:18] Jesus was the seed word of God
[1:27:22] in the womb of a virgin let's look here
[1:27:24] at First Peter 1 and 19. and I'll I'll
[1:27:28] wait for you boys or you boys and girls
[1:27:30] this time
[1:27:31] amen First Peter 1 and 19.
[1:27:35] praise the Lord
[1:27:37] so so when you talk about the Virgin
[1:27:40] birth we're talking about the word of
[1:27:43] God
[1:27:45] falling into a predestinated womb
[1:27:49] the anointing coming down upon that word
[1:27:53] amen and causing it to live quickening
[1:27:56] that word
[1:27:58] amen the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you
[1:28:02] well why does she need the Holy Ghost to
[1:28:04] overshadow you because she was a
[1:28:05] predestinated seed that God had planned
[1:28:08] that word in before the foundation of
[1:28:10] the world
[1:28:13] and you have predestinated words planted
[1:28:18] in your heart from before the foundation
[1:28:20] of the world too
[1:28:22] and just as the Holy Ghost had to
[1:28:24] overshadow the womb of Mary to bring out
[1:28:26] amen the perfect Son of God so do you
[1:28:30] have to have a new birth or you'll never
[1:28:34] understand the mysteries of God you'll
[1:28:36] always try to reason them you'll always
[1:28:38] try to figure them out God is known by
[1:28:42] revelation
[1:28:45] can you say Amen you can't teach God
[1:28:48] it's got to be here
[1:28:49] and then God begins and then as you get
[1:28:51] rid of this then that that new seed on
[1:28:54] the inside well it's the same word it's
[1:28:57] the same word amen it's this right here
[1:29:00] in here
[1:29:02] it's already planted in seed form
[1:29:07] so when the Holy Ghost begins to
[1:29:08] overshadow that seed that was already
[1:29:09] planted before the foundation of the
[1:29:11] world in your heart he knew you would be
[1:29:13] here in laodicea he knew you'd be right
[1:29:15] here in this service here tonight and he
[1:29:17] knew the whole he knew you'd be in this
[1:29:19] bad world he knew that it would just be
[1:29:20] so chaotic and bad and sinful but he
[1:29:23] placed his seed on the inside of you
[1:29:25] and I just think we ought to shout
[1:29:27] hallelujah
[1:29:32] amen let's look at Jesus they're in
[1:29:35] First Peter 1 and 19 are we there
[1:29:38] but with the precious blood of Christ
[1:29:41] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[1:29:43] spot
[1:29:44] who verily was
[1:29:47] foreordained before the foundation of
[1:29:51] the world but was manifest in these last
[1:29:55] times for you and that word for ordained
[1:29:57] is to predetermine
[1:30:00] it was already
[1:30:02] predetermined
[1:30:04] pre-decrete the word was spoke
[1:30:08] Hallelujah
[1:30:10] can I just put it this way I I don't I I
[1:30:13] think this is neat God looked down
[1:30:14] through time before there was ever in
[1:30:16] Adam
[1:30:17] not man Adam but a molecule an atom
[1:30:20] before there was
[1:30:22] before there was air before there was
[1:30:23] water before there was anything it was
[1:30:25] God right
[1:30:27] Hallelujah and God in his mind
[1:30:30] looking down and then all of a sudden
[1:30:32] he saw a fall
[1:30:34] all of a sudden he looked down
[1:30:36] 2023 and he saw some of his sons that
[1:30:39] were going to be right here in Pawnee
[1:30:41] Oklahoma
[1:30:42] and God seen that they were going to
[1:30:43] need a savior and right then before
[1:30:45] there was ever the devil created before
[1:30:49] the garden was ever created Hallelujah a
[1:30:52] lamb was slain
[1:30:56] y'all missed it man that's powerful
[1:31:00] Jesus was not the after product the
[1:31:03] Bible says he was ordained before sin
[1:31:06] got here
[1:31:08] Jesus was not amen the result of sin
[1:31:13] Jesus was ordained before sin ever got
[1:31:17] here
[1:31:19] because God knew the fall was coming God
[1:31:22] knew you was going to need a savior
[1:31:26] oh I'm trying to be good amen
[1:31:30] 14 foreordained somebody say foreordane
[1:31:35] redetermined
[1:31:36] but was manifested in the last days
[1:31:39] let's look at another one real quick
[1:31:40] amen there are several scriptures but
[1:31:42] I'm not going there let's look at Romans
[1:31:44] 13 Revelations 13 and 8.
[1:31:46] Hallelujah
[1:31:49] Hallelujah you see now brother when
[1:31:51] Hiatus don't believe
[1:31:53] that the lamb was slain before the
[1:31:55] foundation of the world
[1:31:56] the lamb was slain two thousand years
[1:31:58] ago we all know that
[1:32:01] it happened here
[1:32:04] in the mind of God
[1:32:06] what
[1:32:07] and all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[1:32:10] worship Him whose names are not written
[1:32:12] in the book of The Life Book of Life of
[1:32:15] the Lamb that was slain from the
[1:32:18] foundation of the world
[1:32:22] he he Jesus was that word living in a
[1:32:28] body
[1:32:29] and all the religious people didn't know
[1:32:31] who he was
[1:32:33] he was the Living Word
[1:32:38] the son of a virgin
[1:32:42] Saturn 800 years prior in Isaiah behold
[1:32:46] of virgins shall conceive
[1:32:48] and you shall call his name the
[1:32:51] Everlasting God the uh the Everlasting
[1:32:54] father the Prince of Peace the Mighty
[1:32:56] God
[1:32:57] is that right here he comes in and now
[1:32:59] they're saying you're claiming to be the
[1:33:01] Son of God God has no Sons God's God He
[1:33:04] Ain't Human and Jesus was saying have
[1:33:07] you not read there in Isaiah 53
[1:33:12] he was bruised
[1:33:14] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:33:16] him by his stripes we are healed he was
[1:33:20] the lamb that was slain in the mind of
[1:33:24] God before the foundation Lord he was
[1:33:26] simply coming and living that word in a
[1:33:32] body come on Church
[1:33:34] you are the predestinated seed of God
[1:33:38] you are here living that word
[1:33:45] you say I don't believe it all right

[1:33:48] every son of The Seven Ages have had to
[1:33:52] come the same way
[1:33:53] by the word of God that was spoke
[1:33:56] before the foundation of the world the
[1:33:57] Bible says there you can put it up there
[1:34:00] uh you don't have to turn there but
[1:34:01] because it's just the first line there a
[1:34:03] First Peter one and two I think

[1:34:41] can you say man
[1:34:43] Hallelujah you see foreknowledge looks
[1:34:46] back
[1:34:48] but predestination looks to Destiny for
[1:34:52] knowledge for knowledge is is when we
[1:34:56] were in the mind of God
[1:34:58] predestination is pointing you and
[1:35:01] establishing your destiny in Christ
[1:35:06] amen hallelujah all right amen so you've
[1:35:10] got the gene word seed of God Jesus this
[1:35:13] is explained to them in Matthew 13 and

[1:35:18] parable of the wheat and the tares amen
[1:35:21] and he says you know uh he says he that
[1:35:24] soweth a good seed is the son of man
[1:35:27] the field is the world
[1:35:29] amen he says the good seed are the
[1:35:32] children of the Kingdom
[1:35:34] but the tares are the weeds are the
[1:35:37] children of the wicked
[1:35:39] the enemy uh that sold them is the devil
[1:35:44] and the Harvest of the world the Harvest
[1:35:47] is the end of the world and the reapers

[1:36:29] season

[1:36:44] prophet can you say Amen now here it is

[1:38:17] another seed is for the light to come on
[1:38:19] it if you put the seed of God in the
[1:38:23] ground when the Holy Ghost comes it'll
[1:38:26] produce what is in the ground
[1:38:30] Jesus says search the scriptures I'm the
[1:38:33] Fulfillment

[1:39:11] your world starts rocking hallelujah oh
[1:39:15] man you don't know how many times I went
[1:39:16] to this scripture when I was a kid I

[1:40:10] God's purposes can't be frustrated your
[1:40:12] purposes can be frustrated man's
[1:40:14] purposes can be frustrating but God's
[1:40:15] purposes will never be frustrated
[1:40:18] watch watch now he goes on to explain
[1:40:20] for whom he did for no
[1:40:25] Hallelujah that means to have knowledge
[1:40:28] of beforehand
[1:40:30] past tense he also did predestinate
[1:40:36] did you notice that's Brit past tense
[1:40:37] now what is predestination what does
[1:40:39] predestinate mean
[1:40:41] anybody know
[1:40:43] determine
[1:40:45] beforehand
[1:40:47] it is to decree or ordain before him for
[1:40:52] so for whom he did for no
[1:40:56] them he also did predestinate
[1:40:59] or to decree or ordain to be conformed
[1:41:01] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:41:03] the firstborn among many Brethren
[1:41:05] moreover whom he did predestinate past
[1:41:08] tense them he also called past tense
[1:41:13] and whom he called past tense then he
[1:41:17] also Justified past tense whom he
[1:41:21] justified past tense he them he also
[1:41:26] also glorified
[1:41:28] past tense
[1:41:31] what shall we save into these things if
[1:41:35] God be for us
[1:41:42] you are just as predestinated as Jesus
[1:41:46] Christ was
[1:41:48] so you can look at scriptures today and
[1:41:51] say search the scriptures devil for they
[1:41:55] are they that testify of who I am
[1:42:00] how do I know how do I know that the
[1:42:04] message is accurate how do I know that
[1:42:07] God is calling me because there is a
[1:42:09] deep that is calling to the deep and if
[1:42:12] there is a deep calling there is a deep
[1:42:14] to respond
[1:42:16] hope Hallelujah when the coyotes are out
[1:42:20] there howling you don't you don't hear
[1:42:22] from you don't hear from the wolves or
[1:42:24] from from uh you know you know cows
[1:42:27] don't start moving no when one coyote
[1:42:29] when you go
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:34] all of a sudden it sounds pretty good
[1:42:36] and then all then then all of a sudden
[1:42:37] from way over here oh
[1:42:40] [Music]
[1:42:41] and before you know it you gotta
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:45] what is it it's the Deep
[1:42:49] calling to the Deep
[1:42:51] and it's the responding
[1:42:53] of the same nature
[1:42:56] back
[1:42:58] and when the Holy Spirit The Living
[1:43:01] logos is walking in the midst of the
[1:43:04] candlesticks and he's revealing his word
[1:43:07] there's something in me saying yes yes
[1:43:11] yes
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:14] foreign
[1:43:16] because he said so how do I know that
[1:43:19] I'm saved because he said so there's
[1:43:22] something calling me
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:28] but praise the Lord
[1:43:30] amen
[1:43:32] so when the devil ever comes back and
[1:43:33] tells you well
[1:43:34] you you you just tell them I'm already
[1:43:37] call I'm already predestinated I'm
[1:43:39] already called I'm already Justified I'm
[1:43:42] already glorified
[1:43:45] how can that be because I was
[1:43:47] predestinated
[1:43:52] that's why Jesus could stand there and
[1:43:53] say destroy this Temple three days I'll
[1:43:56] raise it up
[1:43:59] brother Branham said it wasn't
[1:44:01] necessarily that the Lord showed him
[1:44:03] that he read it in the Bible concerning
[1:44:05] him
[1:44:10] he read it
[1:44:13] that he would have to go into the grave
[1:44:15] for three days well glory to God didn't
[1:44:17] that just wonderful I don't have I just
[1:44:20] believe what God's word says so here we
[1:44:23] go I'm going back again if you want
[1:44:25] deity
[1:44:27] keep his word ever before you
[1:44:32] because the life of the word is there
[1:44:34] with you can you say Amen
[1:44:36] Ephesians 1 and 4 according as he hath
[1:44:39] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:44:43] of the world that we should be holy
[1:44:46] Without Blame before him in love having
[1:44:50] predestinated us
[1:44:52] unto the adoption of children
[1:44:55] so now what happens
[1:44:56] now you say now brother window there in
[1:44:58] first John 5 and 8 it said the other
[1:45:01] night that there are three that bear
[1:45:02] witness in the Earth the spirit the
[1:45:04] water and the blood and these agree in
[1:45:07] one which consummate a birth
[1:45:09] that's right you got to have at the new
[1:45:11] birth or at a natural birth you have to
[1:45:14] have water blood and spirit
[1:45:18] right water's got to break
[1:45:20] blood and then there's got to be spirit
[1:45:24] enter into that Hallelujah
[1:45:28] but you can't have a new birth
[1:45:31] if there's no seed
[1:45:37] I could tell sister Angie have a baby
[1:45:39] she can't have a baby
[1:45:41] unless she's got a seed in her womb
[1:45:49] here I go
[1:45:50] and Angie amen
[1:45:53] now here I go
[1:45:55] you cannot receive a new birth
[1:46:00] if there was not a seed planted in your
[1:46:04] heart before the foundation of the world
[1:46:08] if there's no seed the Holy Spirit could
[1:46:13] Hallelujah
[1:46:15] there's all kinds of water then water
[1:46:16] around here a long time there's all
[1:46:18] kinds of blood there's all kinds of
[1:46:20] spirits that will not mean there's going
[1:46:22] to be a new birth or until there's a
[1:46:25] seed that that falls upon and then
[1:46:32] Hallelujah Jesus was the word
[1:46:37] that the Holy Spirit overshadowed
[1:46:40] can you say Amen
[1:46:42] you happy quickened who were once dead

[1:49:57] the people Romans 1 and 16 I'm not
[1:50:00] ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it
[1:50:02] is the power of God unto salvation First
[1:50:06] Corinthians 2 and 4.
[1:50:09] my speech and my preaching was not with
[1:50:12] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:50:15] the demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:50:17] Power are you going to be a powerful
[1:50:19] church if this happened here
[1:50:23] and we're getting the same oil that
[1:50:26] Jesus had in him
[1:50:31] I'm just trying to tell you
[1:50:33] what this church was is what this church
[1:50:35] has got to be if you're connected to the
[1:50:37] same boat
[1:50:40] Jesus was the Fulfillment of scripture
[1:50:42] you are the Fulfillment of scripture
[1:50:47] oh that just makes me want a shout spit
[1:50:50] scream
[1:50:51] Hallelujah God is so good to us
[1:50:55] amen all right now watch he says but in
[1:50:58] the demonstration of the power of of the
[1:51:01] spirit and of power that your face
[1:51:03] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:51:05] but in the power of God first
[1:51:07] Corinthians 4 and 20 for the kingdom of
[1:51:10] God is not in word but in power
[1:51:18] power first Thessalonians 1 and 5. for
[1:51:19] our gospel came not unto you in word
[1:51:21] only but also in power and in the Holy
[1:51:25] Ghost and much Assurance second
[1:51:27] Corinthians four and six
[1:51:29] for God who's committed the light to
[1:51:30] shine out of Darkness have shined in our
[1:51:32] hearts to give the light of the
[1:51:33] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:51:35] face of Jesus Christ
[1:51:37] but we have this treasure in Earthen
[1:51:39] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:51:42] may be of God
[1:51:43] and not of us
[1:51:46] can you say Amen
[1:51:48] now what did that now what did Acts 2
[1:51:50] and 22 say I'm going to bring a
[1:51:51] scripture in from last week amen you men
[1:51:53] of Israel hear these words uh they're in
[1:51:55] Acts 2 and 22 Jesus of Nazareth a man
[1:51:59] approved of God
[1:52:02] that first church was approved of God
[1:52:07] among you by me approved of God by among
[1:52:11] you by Miracles and wonders and signs
[1:52:12] which God did by him it was God
[1:52:19] now it's God
[1:52:22] and in many membered body
[1:52:28] well glory to God
[1:52:31] all right amen now I want to show you
[1:52:33] something just real quick now you say
[1:52:36] brother window
[1:52:38] why is it that the church
[1:52:40] man why is it that the church here is uh
[1:52:45] I I you know why why
[1:52:48] we talk about power and but but but
[1:52:49] other people do do Miracles too
[1:53:01] well yeah I think I think there are
[1:53:04] gifts there are gifts and callings that
[1:53:06] and it's and it's a different gifts and
[1:53:09] callings or without repentance
[1:53:10] which means you could be a call to the
[1:53:12] ministry you could have you could have
[1:53:14] gifts
[1:53:15] talents um
[1:53:21] Elvis Presley
[1:53:22] had had gifts
[1:53:25] um
[1:53:27] brother Branham says that his his
[1:53:28] brother
[1:53:29] Edward
[1:53:31] was called to be a minister
[1:53:33] but he says he couldn't get his he just
[1:53:34] he couldn't get his act together
[1:53:36] so these come without repent these you
[1:53:38] are born with those gifts
[1:53:41] amen but now there's going to be but
[1:53:44] just because you've got gifts and
[1:53:46] talents doesn't necessarily mean that
[1:53:48] your name's on that Lamb's Book of Life
[1:53:50] those gifts and talents are not the
[1:53:53] predestinated seed and I'm fixing to
[1:53:55] show you watch okay so I'm going to
[1:53:57] create a tree Hallelujah
[1:54:00] amen so you got the you got the trunk of
[1:54:02] the tree
[1:54:03] here this is this is
[1:54:05] amen
[1:54:07] all right we got leaves out here all
[1:54:11] right
[1:54:11] all right
[1:54:13] now here's here's here's the tree
[1:54:18] the vine Jesus says I'm the Vine
[1:54:24] you are the branches
[1:54:26] is that what he said
[1:54:30] if the branches if the branches are
[1:54:32] going to produce any kind of fruit
[1:54:34] they've got to be connected to the Vine
[1:54:37] amen
[1:54:39] so if it is that if this if this is an
[1:54:42] orange tree
[1:54:45] and The Roots
[1:54:46] it'll produce oranges
[1:54:51] in the in the fruit
[1:54:55] Hallelujah
[1:54:56] then you say
[1:54:58] why is it why is it
[1:55:01] that those people that you call false
[1:55:04] are seeing miracles
[1:55:10] why is it
[1:55:12] it's called grafting
[1:55:18] it's a neat little deal brother Michael
[1:55:19] says we need we need to plant one we
[1:55:21] need to do something like that out here
[1:55:22] in the church so we can just go out and
[1:55:23] look at it occasionally because this
[1:55:25] this it's the neatest thing they'll take
[1:55:27] they'll take a little stub that's coming
[1:55:30] off here they'll cut that off
[1:55:33] and they'll make a v now that is a part
[1:55:36] of a branch
[1:55:37] they will take another I meant off this
[1:55:40] other tree amen over here we're going to
[1:55:42] make this that's you know we're going to
[1:55:44] make this a grapefruit
[1:55:47] this here is a grapefruit
[1:55:50] tree
[1:55:52] so they're going to take this Branch
[1:55:53] they're going to they're going to cut
[1:55:55] that off
[1:55:57] then they put this Branch right over
[1:55:59] here
[1:56:02] amen
[1:56:04] and then they splice it and they wrap it
[1:56:06] around right here
[1:56:08] next year
[1:56:11] next year
[1:56:13] this orange tree is now bearing
[1:56:17] grapefruit
[1:56:19] not here in the original not here in the
[1:56:22] original but right here in this grafted
[1:56:25] Vine
[1:56:27] you can also come right out here
[1:56:29] and then bring another one in
[1:56:32] and make this a lemon
[1:56:36] all right
[1:56:38] bearing lemons
[1:56:42] on an orange
[1:56:45] tree
[1:56:50] hooked into the vine of Christ
[1:56:55] but bearing false witness of Christ
[1:57:00] claiming to be a Christian
[1:57:04] but bearing fruit that is contrary to
[1:57:06] the Bible
[1:57:11] look it up it's pretty neat
[1:57:26] mm-hmm
[1:57:28] yep
[1:57:34] yes
[1:57:44] and that and that is a good point and
[1:57:47] what you've and what you're looking at
[1:57:49] is is Christ talking about how that that
[1:57:53] that that God cut Israel off
[1:57:57] and put the Gentile in
[1:58:00] but this is coming but this only can
[1:58:02] come as I just as I've just told you
[1:58:04] through a new birth
[1:58:06] so it's it's the Pig that is being
[1:58:08] turned to a lamb in that regard
[1:58:11] because this we're talking about
[1:58:13] dispensation we're talking about
[1:58:15] dispensation on on uh where God cut the
[1:58:19] one off and now bringing in the Gentile
[1:58:23] elected predestinated seed
[1:58:26] they we were it we we were in sin we
[1:58:30] were in the world but our seed was
[1:58:34] eternal in the mind of God
[1:58:36] so when he has grafted Us in yes we are
[1:58:39] gentiles
[1:58:41] but we are ever bit that root from the
[1:58:45] beginning it was predestinated in us
[1:58:47] though we were we were the dogs
[1:58:51] we were the Gentiles
[1:58:54] so God the Jews forsook him because now
[1:58:57] the lineage is not coming through a
[1:58:59] natural but now it's going to come
[1:59:01] through that spiritual seed Jesus Christ
[1:59:03] his seed and then it brings it in that
[1:59:05] way so there was a dispensational change
[1:59:07] now here we are we're dealing we're
[1:59:10] dealing with the church and let me let
[1:59:12] me just show you and then and then I'll
[1:59:14] I'll um and then I'll see if this
[1:59:16] answers your question
[1:59:18] all right so John 15 and 5. our fruit is
[1:59:22] dependent upon him if you wouldn't mind
[1:59:23] just putting that up Sister Clea John 15
[1:59:26] and 505 got this wrote down right
[1:59:28] I am the vine you are the branch he that
[1:59:31] abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:59:33] bringeth forth much fruit without me you
[1:59:36] can do nothing now
[1:59:37] all right so now let's look here
[1:59:41] when you graft that those branches into
[1:59:44] the Tree of Life
[1:59:47] just as the Antichrist is done now I
[1:59:49] want you to look here at this scripture
[1:59:50] here in Matthew 7 and 21 talking about
[1:59:53] our day when we when they or when the
[1:59:56] Judgment Day
[1:59:57] and which is coming around the corner
[1:59:59] after the Rapture there in Matthew 7 and
[2:00:01] 21. not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[2:00:04] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[2:00:06] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[2:00:09] Father which is in heaven
[2:00:10] many shall say unto me in that day Lord
[2:00:12] Lord have we not prophesied in your name
[2:00:16] in thy name have cast out devils in thy
[2:00:19] name done many wonderful works then will
[2:00:22] I profess unto them I never knew you in
[2:00:25] other words you were never in my
[2:00:27] foreknowledge depart from me ye that
[2:00:30] work iniquity
[2:00:32] so here's Here's Where We Are this is
[2:00:36] this that now now we're talking about
[2:00:38] now the Gentiles
[2:00:40] it don't matter whether you're Jew or
[2:00:42] you're Gentile so whether you're whether
[2:00:44] you're over here with the Jews or
[2:00:46] whether you're here with a gentile God
[2:00:47] is going according to the predestinated
[2:00:50] seed so he's taking this Jewish tree
[2:00:54] and he's taken the Gentiles and grafting
[2:00:57] them in but by Nature
[2:01:00] not not by the nature of the flesh but
[2:01:03] by the nature of that predestinated seed
[2:01:05] of God that he planted in our hearts
[2:01:07] before the foundation of the world
[2:01:09] you understanding
[2:01:20] sure
[2:01:24] right
[2:01:34] yeah
[2:01:36] predestinated seat
[2:01:39] according to the roots the word now
[2:01:41] again Christ is the roots he's the word
[2:01:44] amen so he says search the scriptures
[2:01:46] for that's who I am there was Gentiles
[2:01:49] who were the Gentile dogs lost without
[2:01:51] any kind of a hope that had that same
[2:01:54] seed within them that was planted into
[2:01:57] this other
[2:01:59] okay
[2:02:08] because if
[2:02:14] because it's a citrus it's a citrus tree
[2:02:19] and here's the deal it's it's it's
[2:02:21] bearing false witness because orange is
[2:02:26] citrus
[2:02:27] lemons
[2:02:28] uh grapefruit tangelos
[2:02:31] now here's the deal
[2:02:33] they're bearing false witness of the
[2:02:36] roots of the tree
[2:02:39] they are Spirit men and women serpents
[2:02:42] children are spirits just as you and I
[2:02:47] but only one has Christ seed in their
[2:02:51] heart
[2:02:52] therefore they can come in tapped into
[2:02:55] the same Holy Ghost
[2:02:59] in the last days
[2:03:01] there will be false prophets
[2:03:03] false anointed ones and shall deceive
[2:03:07] the very elected if it was possible
[2:03:10] because they're bearing claiming to be
[2:03:13] Christ
[2:03:14] but they're not
[2:03:16] let me give you let me give you another
[2:03:17] example when when Moses came
[2:03:20] when Moses came to Israel
[2:03:23] and Heap every sign miracle that he'd
[2:03:27] done before the people
[2:03:30] janison Chambers came back and done
[2:03:33] every miracle that Moses could do
[2:03:38] how can that be how can that be they
[2:03:41] even had when he turned his snake when
[2:03:43] he put his rod down and it become a
[2:03:45] snake so did they
[2:03:49] and they use that to try to harden the
[2:03:52] hearts of the people
[2:03:54] but you know what I'll tell you
[2:03:55] something that was different about them
[2:03:57] they could not take the plagues away
[2:04:00] Moses was the only one God's showing him
[2:04:02] so so what what I'm showing here and
[2:04:05] this this is a little bit different than
[2:04:07] than the Jewish tree I'm talking about
[2:04:09] the tree of Christ here now because here
[2:04:12] we are the Jews the Jews were cut off
[2:04:14] and the Gentiles grafted in and and so
[2:04:18] y'all understand his question because
[2:04:20] because the script and he's what he's
[2:04:22] doing is he's asking that question of
[2:04:24] the Bible how that how that the Gentiles
[2:04:26] were grafted in you you had the Jew tree
[2:04:28] the Jew tree was cut down and then we
[2:04:31] were grafted in in its place
[2:04:33] and and but but the lineage is still the
[2:04:37] same you were predestinated in Christ
[2:04:41] before the foundation of the world
[2:05:13] yeah
[2:05:15] yeah
[2:05:26] they're they're they're they're living
[2:05:28] are you talking about the grafted in in
[2:05:30] this one here or the other one that
[2:05:35] yeah
[2:05:37] yeah
[2:05:45] in that tree they produce the very life
[2:05:48] of that tree
[2:05:50] yes
[2:05:51] predestinated
[2:06:18] be a different spirit
[2:06:22] it's a spirit of being devilish or a
[2:06:36] mm-hmm
[2:06:58] OS
[2:07:01] it it it's it's it's it's this is good I
[2:07:05] appreciate you bringing this out uh clay
[2:07:08] um
[2:07:10] First Timothy the third chapter
[2:07:14] let's let's look here just real quickly
[2:07:17] first Timothy or is it second Timothy
[2:07:31] it's
[2:07:32] this gets fun amen all right I don't
[2:07:34] know it's Wednesday night so we gotta we
[2:07:36] gotta we will we'll we'll shut it down
[2:07:38] here in a minute okay they're they're in
[2:07:40] second Timothy three and one know this
[2:07:43] also that in the last days perilous time
[2:07:46] shall come
[2:07:47] men shall be lovers of their own selves
[2:07:50] Covetous bolster proud blasphemers
[2:07:53] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[2:07:56] without natural affection truce Breakers
[2:07:58] false accusers incontinent Fierce
[2:08:01] despisers of those that are good
[2:08:02] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[2:08:06] pleasure more than lovers of God now
[2:08:08] this sounds like they're all sinners
[2:08:09] having a form of godliness but denying
[2:08:15] the power thereof from such turn away so
[2:08:17] now this is in the Christian church
[2:08:19] for of this sort are they which creep
[2:08:21] into houses
[2:08:23] amen television evangelist internet lead
[2:08:28] captive silly women Laden with sins LED
[2:08:31] away with diverse lust
[2:08:33] ever learning never able to come to the
[2:08:36] knowledge of the truth now as Janice and
[2:08:40] Chambers withstood Moses so do these
[2:08:43] also resist the truth men of corrupt
[2:08:45] mind rep bait concerning the faith now
[2:08:50] now you hear you know so here here we
[2:08:53] are talking again in the Christian
[2:08:56] church
[2:08:57] this is in the Christian church
[2:09:00] having a form of godliness connecting to
[2:09:04] the life can speak in tongues
[2:09:11] was Balaam a false prophet
[2:09:15] right how many believe Balaam was just
[2:09:17] as evil as they get
[2:09:19] and yet Balaam prophesied of Jesus birth
[2:09:24] that prophecy came to pass and his
[2:09:26] prophecy is still coming to pass
[2:09:30] and he's a false prophet
[2:09:34] he couldn't know that other than through
[2:09:35] the whole through God the Bible says the
[2:09:39] rain
[2:09:40] shall fall on the
[2:09:45] and the son shall come on the good and
[2:09:50] the evil
[2:09:53] the same anointing
[2:09:56] that is causing the wheat to come up is
[2:09:58] the same anointing that's causing the
[2:10:02] cares to come up
[2:10:04] it depends the seed
[2:10:07] so it's huh
[2:10:09] there you go that's that's a good one
[2:10:11] yes
[2:10:17] Judas was part of the 70 that went out
[2:10:20] and and was given the power to cast out
[2:10:22] Devils that's right
[2:10:24] that's right Judas was given that power
[2:10:26] and he was the son of the serpent from
[2:10:29] the beginning
[2:10:30] the Son of Perdition is that right so
[2:10:32] now yeah
[2:10:37] angel of Light yep that's right yep
[2:10:58] the fruit
[2:11:06] if that tree itself puts forth another
[2:11:10] branch is going to be it will it will
[2:11:14] that and and that is and that is true
[2:11:16] and and I want y'all I want y'all to
[2:11:18] catch this this is this yeah you bring
[2:11:20] up a good point so let's just say let's
[2:11:22] just say this branch has been you know
[2:11:24] that's a lemon okay
[2:11:26] okay if when the tree dies
[2:11:30] and the life goes back down on the
[2:11:32] ground when it comes up the next year
[2:11:34] it'll still bring out a limit
[2:11:37] okay but if the tree ever produces of
[2:11:42] its own
[2:11:43] again
[2:11:45] let's just let's just move up here at
[2:11:46] the top of the tree
[2:11:48] it'll produce oranges
[2:11:51] look look at them on the online I mean
[2:11:53] they've got these things ever they have
[2:11:54] they have got trees they've got trees
[2:11:57] with all of this fruit all over it
[2:12:01] who's hollering my name yeah
[2:12:05] oh you do put that up there Hallelujah
[2:12:10] man
[2:12:12] so there's there's a tree that's got
[2:12:14] oranges
[2:12:16] lemons
[2:12:17] grapefruit
[2:12:22] tangelo's
[2:12:26] and they are all bearing false witness
[2:12:33] of the roots
[2:12:44] absolutely you can listen listen
[2:12:47] I I came out of Pentecost guys
[2:12:51] I seen miracles
[2:12:57] I I've seen guys that were living as
[2:13:00] corrupt reprobates
[2:13:04] cheating on their wives and Performing
[2:13:07] miracles
[2:13:14] Hallelujah right
[2:13:17] and it's interesting that this grafting
[2:13:19] has just they have just got this
[2:13:21] grafting in our day and here we are
[2:13:24] we're seeing we're seeing how the
[2:13:25] enemy's coming in and just tapping into
[2:13:28] the Holy Spirit tap it it's the same
[2:13:30] rain it's the same rain falling upon but
[2:13:33] it's the seed their seed is lemons and
[2:13:38] not oranges
[2:13:40] amen
[2:13:50] well I wouldn't doubt it that's going to
[2:13:52] be it's it's going to be every
[2:13:54] everywhere
[2:13:56] living but
[2:14:05] no no it's the enemy and again now this
[2:14:08] ain't and I will say this you ain't
[2:14:10] going to find that in scripture that's
[2:14:12] not script I'm giving I'm just given an
[2:14:14] illustration on I'm given an
[2:14:16] illustration on on what is causing this
[2:14:20] what what what what is causing the
[2:14:23] Christian church
[2:14:25] who claims who who
[2:14:29] says
[2:14:30] like that like that deal that who put
[2:14:32] that deal on there today yeah yeah of
[2:14:35] that of that Lutheran
[2:14:37] woman preacher you know out there with a
[2:14:40] lbq whatever that is and and and uh and
[2:14:44] they want to say well let me talk to you
[2:14:45] about the Bible no you want to talk to
[2:14:47] me about the Bible no no no no no no no
[2:14:48] no evangelize to me tell me no no I
[2:14:51] don't want to tell you to just come to
[2:14:52] my church well okay
[2:14:57] claiming to be Christ
[2:15:00] and bearing fruit that is totally
[2:15:03] opposite he says are you born again
[2:15:20] yes
[2:15:22] yes the roots is Christ he is the vine
[2:15:26] we are the branches
[2:15:29] the devil has tried to come in and take
[2:15:31] this righteous tree
[2:15:33] that God God that was forwarding in the
[2:15:37] mind of God before the foundation of the
[2:15:38] world and Satan has can I Satan has come
[2:15:41] in and grafted his own tree into that
[2:15:44] amen because we're all Spirit beings
[2:15:48] the root is in the soul the spirit
[2:15:52] the spirit we've all got the the uh uh
[2:15:56] uh uh
[2:15:58] amen the
[2:16:00] Adolf Hitler
[2:16:02] was a spirit man
[2:16:05] uh
[2:16:06] Jeffrey Dahmer
[2:16:08] was a spirit man
[2:16:10] just as you're a spirit man
[2:16:13] Satan anoints that spirit and can get it
[2:16:16] so close that diviners
[2:16:19] amen with a Ouija board or a diviner uh
[2:16:23] uh you know looking at her in her glass
[2:16:25] can can actually foretell things and get
[2:16:27] it right sometimes they're Spirit
[2:16:30] individuals and they claim that but what
[2:16:34] happens is when the church claims to be
[2:16:37] Christians and they're not Christians
[2:16:39] and they're living contrary it shows
[2:16:42] from the roots that it's wrong
[2:16:47] I don't care what the bad to say I don't
[2:16:51] care what the Methodist the Pentecostal
[2:16:52] or anyone else is I'm going to Bear
[2:16:55] witness of the root
[2:16:57] the word
[2:16:59] y'all understand that
[2:17:01] you see that
[2:17:05] that and and but you're but but what you
[2:17:08] said is exactly right when it puts out
[2:17:10] another branch
[2:17:12] it will be an orange that's interesting
[2:17:16] it's really interesting
[2:17:17] and uh it's quite an incredible thing
[2:17:19] would you say something
[2:17:23] Hallelujah
[2:17:40] so close that it would deceive the very
[2:17:44] elect if possible that means these
[2:17:47] fellas are going to be gifted
[2:17:51] anointed
[2:17:52] tapping in to something Supernatural
[2:18:00] you know them by their fruit
[2:18:03] what what did what did God say in the
[2:18:05] Old Testament and you musicians can come
[2:18:07] but what did God say in in the Old
[2:18:09] Testament he says now if a diviner
[2:18:11] divine's true
[2:18:14] and then leads you contrary to what I
[2:18:18] have said he says that man is false
[2:18:22] in order to be true you've got to be
[2:18:25] tapped in some way the rain is falling
[2:18:28] and the Terrors are rejoicing the
[2:18:30] Terrors are maturing but the seed and
[2:18:34] there is where I'm talking about in the
[2:18:36] in the candlesticks y'all catching that
[2:18:38] the son of man walking it is that Living
[2:18:41] Word
[2:18:43] walking through the churches
[2:18:45] and we're going to start seeing we're
[2:18:48] going to start seeing brother Dennis
[2:18:51] how Satan has attached himself to the
[2:18:53] Christian church all the way back there
[2:18:56] in the in in the early church and we're
[2:18:58] going to start seeing how how that is
[2:19:01] how Satan has done it now we know that
[2:19:04] they are of a false spirit
[2:19:06] we know
[2:19:07] but see the world doesn't know that
[2:19:13] We Know by the word
[2:19:17] that's right
[2:19:19] you judge it by the word and when you
[2:19:21] look at that you're thinking
[2:19:23] well they're crying tears
[2:19:26] oh
[2:19:28] they're crying tears and you might get
[2:19:31] your feelings hurt from what I said the
[2:19:32] other night about the Gaither videos
[2:19:34] about all those sweet hollow sweet
[2:19:37] little ladies and all painted up and
[2:19:39] hair all cut and and and you think oh
[2:19:44] Christian they're Christians
[2:19:48] if it's an orange tree it's going to
[2:19:50] Bear oranges
[2:19:52] right
[2:19:53] now I know that there's some that might
[2:19:55] not have heard the truth but if they've
[2:19:58] heard the truth there'll be many there
[2:19:59] that that have not heard the truth
[2:20:03] and they're judged by what they know but
[2:20:05] if you and I have taken that word we're
[2:20:08] grafted in or we we are part of that
[2:20:10] root system that's who we are
[2:20:14] you can come up cry at crocodile tears
[2:20:17] you can dance and shout all over the
[2:20:18] building
[2:20:19] you can you can perform Miracles and
[2:20:22] still go to hell
[2:20:26] so I didn't get quite get to where I
[2:20:28] wanted to finish just because there's
[2:20:31] the fake
[2:20:33] does not mean that the real Pentecostal
[2:20:36] Skies
[2:20:37] are not full of the blessings neither
[2:20:40] I have a problem
[2:20:41] with people saying well
[2:20:43] oh you speak in tongues oh you're
[2:20:45] Pentecostal no no no no no no no
[2:20:47] [Music]
[2:20:49] if the if the root of this spoke in
[2:20:53] tongues if the first church spoke in
[2:20:56] tongues the last church can speak in
[2:20:58] tongues
[2:21:00] if the first church had prophecy
[2:21:04] the last church will have prophecy
[2:21:08] are you are you hearing me
[2:21:11] oh well well I don't want no one to turn
[2:21:13] meth oh I don't want to be considered
[2:21:14] false
[2:21:15] you're going to be false if you ain't
[2:21:18] got no life in you you just let the Holy
[2:21:20] Spirit come in you that Living Word live
[2:21:22] his life through you there's going to be
[2:21:24] gifts in operation there's going to be
[2:21:27] Miracles and there's going to be the
[2:21:28] moving of God and we are going to grow
[2:21:31] and we do see them
[2:21:33] amen
[2:21:36] that baby that we just that we've been
[2:21:37] praying for that shameful baby
[2:21:40] you know
[2:21:42] um
[2:21:45] that was a bad situation
[2:21:49] said baby he cannot live I wasn't going
[2:21:52] to live it just wasn't going to live
[2:21:54] past a year
[2:21:57] and those were newly those were
[2:21:58] newlyweds and they were just so worried
[2:22:01] and things you know and then
[2:22:03] and then we got the news today that the
[2:22:04] doctor is now saying they can't find it
[2:22:06] in the baby's system it may be in the
[2:22:08] genes and it might affect his the baby's
[2:22:11] children on down but we're saying nah
[2:22:14] amen the doctor trying to cover for
[2:22:16] himself but you know what God came on
[2:22:18] the scene and touch that baby
[2:22:21] he touched that baby
[2:22:22] [Applause]
[2:22:26] the problem is is we get so much of that
[2:22:28] unbelief in our hearts and we say well
[2:22:30] but that might have well but no why
[2:22:31] can't we just accept God and just
[2:22:33] believe God for Supernatural things in
[2:22:35] our lives not make them up but accept
[2:22:37] them when they come I don't have to make
[2:22:39] we don't have to make nothing up God's
[2:22:41] with us
[2:22:43] stick with that root stick with that
[2:22:46] word
[2:22:47] the life will follow the word
[2:22:51] this
[2:22:52] is written word
[2:22:55] what we want is the Living Word to come
[2:22:59] in this day
[2:23:01] and light that word up in our hearts
[2:23:05] can you say Amen how is it how is it
[2:23:08] that that we all how is it that when you
[2:23:12] hear truth
[2:23:13] and and then all of a sudden it's like
[2:23:15] you've always known it it's like yeah
[2:23:18] yeah
[2:23:21] it was there you didn't know it
[2:23:24] you didn't know it
[2:23:26] but it's that Gentile going back to that
[2:23:28] that seed something within here amen
[2:23:31] what did the Apostle Paul say the
[2:23:34] Gentiles who do by do by Nature that the
[2:23:37] Gentiles without the law do by Nature
[2:23:39] that which is contained in the law
[2:23:42] it shows that he says the law was
[2:23:46] written in their hearts and in their
[2:23:49] minds oh it'd be wonderful isn't he so
[2:23:52] good to us
[2:23:53] amen now any more questions I don't want
[2:23:55] to leave I know it's getting late but I
[2:23:57] I don't want to leave anyone hanging
[2:23:58] neither any other questions real quick
[2:24:01] and I can and and I can uh what I'll do
[2:24:05] is I'll
[2:24:06] I'll do it I'll go a little bit deeper
[2:24:08] in this little in this deal too on the
[2:24:10] on the uh the Holy Spirit
[2:24:20] yes
[2:24:26] yep
[2:24:30] the Citrus life yes
[2:24:33] yep and they do it
[2:24:36] they do it they'll come back every year
[2:24:38] people are planting them in there the
[2:24:40] people are planting them
[2:24:46] in he does yes there are two vines that
[2:24:49] have been growing in the church
[2:24:52] and and and and and this is this has
[2:24:54] been the deal all along
[2:24:56] and now this is and this is simply what
[2:25:00] the reason I brought I brought this in
[2:25:02] there is no scripture
[2:25:04] that that that necessarily says it this
[2:25:08] way
[2:25:09] but I'm what I'm trying to show was
[2:25:11] Balaam hooked into this life in order to
[2:25:14] prophesy something that is still coming
[2:25:16] to pass
[2:25:18] janison Chambers hooked into that light
[2:25:20] because that power only comes from God
[2:25:23] he hooked into that
[2:25:25] and so that that but the believer will
[2:25:28] always bear the fruit of the root there
[2:25:33] it is the cry yes Satan has his bride
[2:25:37] God has his bride but the thing is it's
[2:25:41] all within the framework
[2:25:43] of the one tree it's all in the
[2:25:45] framework of the Christian church
[2:25:51] what he does have his tree yeah
[2:25:58] yes
[2:26:06] that's that's right that's right
[2:26:09] you got this tree if you've got this uh
[2:26:11] if you've got this tree over here let's
[2:26:13] just call this let's just call this
[2:26:15] Satan's tree
[2:26:18] I mean we know you know you've got this
[2:26:21] tree here
[2:26:23] and and uh
[2:26:26] that's that's that's that's the tree of
[2:26:29] of the serpent
[2:26:31] anything rebellious sin
[2:26:35] um and and we know that Buddha is gonna
[2:26:38] religion is going to come off this the
[2:26:40] bahaminism and all of these that's that
[2:26:43] is the tree of the devil and the and and
[2:26:45] Satan and it will come in frusion and
[2:26:47] this that's that's or you could use the
[2:26:49] the wheat and the and the tares you know
[2:26:52] back the weed and the weeds but what
[2:26:55] happens is the Bible says that in the
[2:26:57] last days it would get so much that
[2:26:59] Satan would take it off that put it over
[2:27:03] here to make it look like it's Christian
[2:27:08] they're using the Bible
[2:27:10] they're using they're speaking in
[2:27:13] tongues
[2:27:14] they're doing it all
[2:27:17] and it don't look nothing
[2:27:18] like this
[2:27:20] you did you see that so so there's what
[2:27:23] that you can't be deceived by this by
[2:27:25] this tree because you know that's that's
[2:27:27] that's going bad the Deception comes
[2:27:30] from this right here
[2:27:38] yes yes you are you are it was a god
[2:27:42] dealt with nothing but the Jews
[2:27:45] the Gentiles had nothing to do with it
[2:27:47] God dealt with Abraham and his seed as a
[2:27:51] natural people up until Christ Christ
[2:27:53] had to come out of the lineage of David
[2:27:57] the natural lineage
[2:27:59] but when the Holy Ghost came
[2:28:01] and they rejected Christ rejected the
[2:28:04] Holy Spirit
[2:28:05] then God pruned that tree
[2:28:08] and put the Gentiles into that tree now
[2:28:12] that doesn't mean that the Jews are not
[2:28:13] going to God's going to reveal
[2:28:15] themselves back to the Gentiles the
[2:28:17] Apostle Paul says have they all had they
[2:28:19] have they have they sinned that they
[2:28:21] should uh uh you know totally be you
[2:28:24] know uh put away by God and and the
[2:28:27] Apostle Paul says God forbid
[2:28:29] there's going to come back a time where
[2:28:31] that tree is going to grow again
[2:28:34] and it but it will produce the same
[2:28:37] roots
[2:28:38] as are the same fruit that you as
[2:28:41] Gentiles produce the Life of Christ
[2:28:44] you understand what I'm saying
[2:28:59] ultimately yeah ultimately she's on her
[2:29:01] own she she's I mean she is the wife she
[2:29:05] will be the wife of Satan
[2:29:07] and she will be and and she will be uh
[2:29:10] destroyed
[2:29:12] and we know it we know it as as church
[2:29:15] members
[2:29:16] but they don't know it outside there
[2:29:19] we know it you know we can we we we we
[2:29:21] see because we we're looking at the
[2:29:23] fruit of the thing and we can see
[2:29:25] exactly
[2:29:27] the the harlots we can see all of
[2:29:29] that and so in that regard you know on
[2:29:32] these types you can't take these types
[2:29:33] and and take them away if if you okay
[2:29:38] and we're close I promise but you look
[2:29:40] at Abraham
[2:29:42] okay
[2:29:43] you got to be careful when to start and
[2:29:44] stop your type with Abraham
[2:29:46] because Abraham had that son and then
[2:29:49] after that then he had then he had
[2:29:51] daughters and then he went on and then
[2:29:53] he went you know Noah
[2:29:55] you got to know when to start your type
[2:29:57] and in your type yes sir yes sir or
[2:29:59] you'll have no you'll have Noah becoming
[2:30:01] a drunk after after after he got into
[2:30:03] the New World
[2:30:05] um y'all understand that so when we're
[2:30:07] using our types these types
[2:30:10] and as we get into the revelations
[2:30:12] you'll see these types here that God's
[2:30:14] given us and we've got to keep those
[2:30:16] types exactly and not confuse them with
[2:30:18] this that and the other these are just
[2:30:20] simply types to show like like
[2:30:23] um
[2:30:25] uh
[2:30:26] uh like
[2:30:28] Joseph
[2:30:30] and and
[2:30:32] um their their Joseph was exalted to the
[2:30:35] right hand of the Throne of pharaoh
[2:30:38] he had a gentile bride in the palace
[2:30:41] when he reveals himself to his brothers
[2:30:43] when his Brethren that's a type that you
[2:30:46] and I are going to be caught up in the
[2:30:48] rapture
[2:30:49] when God reveals him Jesus reveals
[2:30:51] himself to the hundred and forty four
[2:30:53] thousand
[2:30:54] and shows himself that way but you got
[2:30:57] to know when to stop that type and then
[2:30:59] as you're going through y'all understand
[2:31:01] that so so so
[2:31:03] the the the the
[2:31:06] um Satan's group is known as the
[2:31:09] Satan's group is is is has got has
[2:31:13] gotten many different names and the
[2:31:15] bride you know sometimes we're called
[2:31:18] the sons of God sometimes we're called
