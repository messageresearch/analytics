[54:38] my disciple amen we'll let you be
[54:46] seated i' like to speak to you this
[54:50] morning on faith to
[54:52] win amen Faith to win I as we reading
[54:56] our scripture reading this morning Jesus
[54:58] is trying to get across an important
[55:01] lesson that it isn't he that starts is
[55:04] he that
[55:06] finishes amen and you know the only
[55:08] winner in the race that we're in is the
[55:11] one who crosses the finished line it's
[55:14] not about beginning it's not about
[55:15] starting it's about finishing and it's
[55:18] about finishing to win amen I I know we
[55:21] live in a time you know of participation
[55:23] trophies you know you get a
[55:25] participation trophy if you participate
[55:27] but you're not going to get a trophy
[55:29] because you participated in this race
[55:32] you'll only get a trophy if you finish
[55:34] this race you know athletes train and
[55:37] they train and they run and they lift
[55:40] weights and they beat their bodies into
[55:42] subjections and they get up you know
[55:44] when their body don't want to they eat
[55:46] right things when their body don't want
[55:48] to they what because they have a goal
[55:50] and they're fighting to win and you know
[55:52] they're fighting to win a corruptible
[55:54] Crown there's men that won trophies uh
[55:57] years ago that they can't even find them
[55:59] no more or they've decayed now and
[56:00] they're gone but you know I I believe we
[56:03] ought to have much more inside of us to
[56:05] fight to win because we're not W trying
[56:08] to win a corruptible crown of some
[56:10] wreath or some golden tablet but we're
[56:13] here to win an Incorruptible crown and
[56:16] you know I I was looking upon this
[56:17] thought as I thought how in the world am
[56:19] I going to close these meetings out and
[56:22] and and I got to I got to looking at at
[56:24] the at the at what it takes to win and
[56:26] what and you know and and there's this
[56:28] man he came from Tanzania maybe you've
[56:30] heard this story uh but it was name was
[56:33] John Steven uh Acra I can't pronounce
[56:36] his last name but anyway he's from
[56:37] Tanzania and he went to the 1968 Summer
[56:41] Olympics and while competing you know he
[56:43] he he got a cramp and and he because he
[56:45] was in some high altitude and that
[56:47] wasn't what he trained in because that's
[56:49] not what his country had and so and so
[56:51] way he gets this cramp in his muscle but
[56:53] he continues to run and you know
[56:55] somewhere about the middle of the race
[56:57] he was jockeying for position and
[56:59] between some Runners and he was hit and
[57:01] he fell down wounded wounded himself
[57:03] really bad and he dislocated his knee
[57:05] joint and he hit his shoulder real hard
[57:08] but however he continued running and you
[57:10] know he finished last among the 57 that
[57:14] completed the race now there was 75 that
[57:16] started the race but there was 57 that
[57:19] completed it and he was one of them and
[57:21] you know he finished in about 3 hours
[57:24] and 25 minutes and 27 seconds which is
[57:27] exactly 1 hour and 5 minutes behind the
[57:30] winter he said but by the time he came
[57:32] across a Finish Line his knee was
[57:34] bandaged and it was bleeding there was
[57:36] only a few people left in the stadium
[57:38] the sun had set and you know the
[57:40] television crew was wasn't there but
[57:41] they was sent back you know because
[57:43] there was they heard one more Runner was
[57:45] about to finish and as he finally
[57:47] crossed the line a cheer came from a
[57:49] small crowd and when interviewed later
[57:51] he was asked why he continued to run he
[57:54] he said well my country did not send me
[57:57] 5,000 miles to start a race they sent me
[58:01] 5,000 Mi to finish a race Hallelujah I
[58:05] want you to understand God didn't send
[58:08] you here to
[58:10] start amen he put Paul and those Runners
[58:13] to start the race but he put you here to
[58:15] finish the race amen we must be
[58:18] finishers there has to be a
[58:19] determination on the inside of us that
[58:22] there's nothing going to make me quit
[58:24] there's nothing that's going to make me
[58:25] stop I'm not going to be short of the go
[58:28] line but I am going to cross the finish
[58:30] line amen you know there got to be
[58:33] something on the inside of you that when
[58:35] the going gets tough you get tougher
[58:38] amen when things get begin to get harder
[58:40] You Dig Down Deeper because I am a
[58:43] finisher I am going to cross this line I
[58:46] am going to finish this race God didn't
[58:48] put me here to quit God didn't put me
[58:51] here to lay down God didn't put me here
[58:53] to rub my sores and my wounds and all of
[58:56] that God put me here to
[59:00] finish hallelujah amen Jesus would say
[59:03] this about himself he said my meat or
[59:06] what gives me strength is to do the work
[59:08] of him that sent me and to finish his
[59:11] work amen in John 5 and 36 he said
[59:14] behold I have a greater witness than
[59:16] that of John for The Works which the
[59:18] father has given me to finish amen
[59:21] finish you know he he he came down to
[59:23] that part where he had to bring his body
[59:25] and his thoughts and everything into
[59:28] subjection and and we mentioned it the
[59:29] other morning he was there Crying In The
[59:32] Garden of Gethsemane and he Lord let
[59:34] this cup pass from me amen what was it
[59:36] it was a war between his flesh and his
[59:38] spirit and amen what what was down on
[59:40] the inside of him and he all of a sudden
[59:43] he began to say not my will but thy will
[59:46] be done and he went to the Finish Line
[59:49] it wasn't an easy Finish Line he had to
[59:51] be beat he had to be scored he had to be
[59:53] mocked he had had to go through all
[59:55] kinds of things but he crossed the
[59:57] finish line and he's hanging upon that
[59:59] cross what was the words out of his
[1:00:01] mouth it is finished it is done it is
[1:00:05] finished it is over with amen if he can
[1:00:08] just get you to
[1:00:10] believe the same life that was in that
[1:00:13] finisher has now come in some more
[1:00:15] people and that life of that finisher is
[1:00:18] here to finish another race and they
[1:00:20] will lay their flesh down they will lay
[1:00:22] their attitudes down they will lay what
[1:00:25] they want down and say not my will but
[1:00:27] thy will be done let me finish the race
[1:00:31] that has
[1:00:32] [Applause]
[1:00:35] begun do you understand in a in a relay
[1:00:38] race they put the best at the last they
[1:00:40] put him at the first and they put him at
[1:00:42] the last the first sets the pace and the
[1:00:45] last finishes

[1:01:00] there was wonders and there was healings
[1:01:02] and there was Deliverance and there was
[1:01:03] the Holy Ghost Power that'll rise up
[1:01:05] above any kind of devil amen and we are
[1:01:07] here to finish with the same attitude
[1:01:10] Paul had with the same life Jesus had to
[1:01:14] finish the race that has been
[1:01:21] started Hallelujah when he said it's
[1:01:24] finished Satan lost all power he can
[1:01:26] only Bluff you now he can if he can
[1:01:28] Bluff you into something all right
[1:01:30] you'll have to have it but legally he
[1:01:32] has no power because Jesus said is
[1:01:34] finished he is nothing but a
[1:01:38] bluff if I can put it to you very
[1:01:40] plainly this morning amen he ain't
[1:01:42] nothing but a
[1:01:44] puppet Amen brother bandam said God
[1:01:47] allows troubles to come he said but God
[1:01:49] puts harnesses upon it and bits in his
[1:01:52] mouth amen the devil has a harness on
[1:01:55] him he has a bit on him he can only go
[1:01:57] so far he can only do so much he can
[1:02:00] only do what God allows him to do he
[1:02:04] just a dumb puppet he just a bluff he's
[1:02:06] a nobody he's a nothing amen he'll only
[1:02:09] do he can only do what you allow
[1:02:16] him
[1:02:18] amen yeah boy we going to get into
[1:02:20] something just hang on hang
[1:02:22] tight now said something in the word can
[1:02:25] make you realize you're free by the
[1:02:28] grace of God then the word makes you
[1:02:30] understand or some Act of God that's
[1:02:32] included you amen it included you it
[1:02:35] includes its all then you accept it on
[1:02:37] those basis you're free you don't have
[1:02:39] to feel any different you don't have to
[1:02:41] look any different you're
[1:02:44] free Jesus never did say do you feel it
[1:02:47] he said Do you believe it it's faith
[1:02:50] faith is a mighty arm that holds a sharp
[1:02:52] two-edged sword of the god word of God
[1:02:55] and that sharp toed sword will cut every
[1:02:57] Promise free if that arm of faith is
[1:03:00] yielded is able to yield that sword some
[1:03:02] people may have weak muscle trouble they
[1:03:04] can only cut off a little scratch enough
[1:03:06] to come to church every once in a
[1:03:08] while amen others can cut their way to
[1:03:10] justification but some can go all the
[1:03:13] way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:15] that great strong arm holding this Bible
[1:03:18] can cut every Promise free so be strong
[1:03:21] in the Lord be strong in the
[1:03:27] Lord amen amen in John 16 and verse 16
[1:03:32] we can turn there if you would John 16
[1:03:34] verse 16 he said a little while ye shall
[1:03:36] see me and again a little while you
[1:03:38] shall not see me because I go to the
[1:03:41] father then some said of the disciples
[1:03:43] among themselves what do this say what
[1:03:45] is this saying a little while you'll not
[1:03:47] see me and again a little while you'll
[1:03:49] see me because I go to the father they
[1:03:52] couldn't understand this because he used
[1:03:53] the same term a little
[1:03:55] while but one little while was only a
[1:03:57] few days they wasn't going to see him
[1:03:59] again another little while was going to
[1:04:00] be 2,000
[1:04:03] years but to God everything's just a
[1:04:05] little
[1:04:06] while cuz he's not a creature of time
[1:04:09] he's a creature of Eternity we on the
[1:04:12] other hand are all about time and and
[1:04:14] time you know time to go to lunch time
[1:04:16] for the service to end time for this to
[1:04:18] happen time God's not interested in your
[1:04:20] time he's a god of Eternity and so you
[1:04:23] go through things for a little
[1:04:27] while how's long how long is this going
[1:04:29] to last brother Timothy a little while
[1:04:33] amen a little while and some of the
[1:04:34] disciples wondered about them what does
[1:04:36] this say in a little while and Jesus
[1:04:38] knew what they were desires to ask him
[1:04:40] and said unto you choir among yourself
[1:04:42] while I've said a little while you shall
[1:04:43] not see me and a little while you shall
[1:04:45] see me verely verely I say unto you that
[1:04:48] you shall weep and lament but the world
[1:04:50] shall rejoice and you shall be sorrowful
[1:04:53] but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy
[1:04:55] a woman when she's in travail has sorrow
[1:04:58] because her hour has come but soon as
[1:05:00] she's delivered of the child she
[1:05:02] remember no more anguish for the joy
[1:05:04] that AO man is Born Into the world and
[1:05:07] ye now therefore have sorrow but I will
[1:05:09] see you
[1:05:12] again Hallelujah I will see you again
[1:05:16] and your heart shall rejoice and your
[1:05:19] joy no man will be able to take from
[1:05:23] you in that day you shall ask me nothing
[1:05:26] verely verely I'll say unto you
[1:05:28] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[1:05:29] my name he will give it to you hither to
[1:05:32] have you asked nothing in my name ask
[1:05:34] and you shall receive that your joy may
[1:05:37] be
[1:05:40] full these things have I spoke to you in
[1:05:43] Proverbs but the time cometh when I no
[1:05:45] more speak to you in
[1:05:51] Proverbs and at that time Hallelujah the
[1:05:55] seventh Angels shall begin to sound and
[1:05:58] all the Mysteries should be finished
[1:06:00] he's not speaking to us in Proverbs no
[1:06:01] more at that time I speak to you in
[1:06:03] proverb but I shall show you plainly of
[1:06:05] the father at that day you shall ask in
[1:06:08] my name and I say not unto you I will
[1:06:10] pray the father for you for the father
[1:06:12] himself love you because he had loved me
[1:06:14] and believe that I came from God I came
[1:06:17] from the father and I've come into this
[1:06:19] world I leave the world and I go to the
[1:06:20] father his disciples says lo now speak
[1:06:22] us out plainly speak no proverb now
[1:06:25] we're sure that thou knowest all things
[1:06:27] and needeth not any man should ask thee
[1:06:30] but this we believe that thou comest
[1:06:31] from God he said do you now believe
[1:06:33] behold the hour cometh yay is now come
[1:06:36] that you shall be scattered every man to
[1:06:39] his own and shall leave me alone and yet
[1:06:41] I'm not alone because the father is with
[1:06:43] me these things have I spoken unto you
[1:06:45] that in me you might have
[1:06:49] peace what he told of all the sorrow and
[1:06:52] all the problems and all but I've told
[1:06:54] you all this that you can have peace cuz
[1:06:57] in the world you shall have tribulation
[1:06:59] but be of good cheer I have overcome the
[1:07:03] [Applause]
[1:07:05] world if he's overcome the world he's
[1:07:08] overcome everything in the
[1:07:11] world Hallelujah all things are under
[1:07:15] his feet amen just like brother Brandon
[1:07:17] dealing with that Maniac in Portland you
[1:07:19] know that one in Oregon that came up
[1:07:20] made that challenge and he said he said
[1:07:22] he's going to spit in his face and do
[1:07:24] beat him up and do all that and he said
[1:07:26] before I knew what I was saying I said
[1:07:28] but you will fall over my feet and he
[1:07:31] said we went to back to RAR back to hit
[1:07:33] him and it's like an invisible force hit
[1:07:35] him and knocked him down and the
[1:07:37] policeman said come over said is he
[1:07:38] delivered he said no he's not delivered
[1:07:40] but will you mindly kind of just move
[1:07:42] him off my feet and he said he got back
[1:07:44] up and he said now as I was saying faith
[1:07:47] is a substance of things hoped for the
[1:07:49] evidence of Things Not Seen he said
[1:07:51] about that time somebody jumped out of a
[1:07:53] wheelchair somebody come off a c he said
[1:07:56] within about 5 minutes there wasn't a
[1:07:58] sick person in the building he said why
[1:08:00] cuz that chief of that tribe of demons
[1:08:03] made his Challenge and he
[1:08:07] lost Hallelujah and he said when he fell
[1:08:10] everything under him
[1:08:12] [Applause]
[1:08:14] fell Hallelujah devil I want you to
[1:08:17] understand you are defeated the Demons
[1:08:20] of hell are defeated everything under
[1:08:23] you is
[1:08:31] lost Jesus finished so you can finish he
[1:08:36] won so you can
[1:08:40] win but you can only win if you have the
[1:08:43] spirit of the winner on the inside of
[1:08:46] you have any man heard that song I heard
[1:08:48] it over in Europe Jesus is a winter man
[1:08:50] a winter man winter man I like the other
[1:08:53] part Satan is a loser man loser
[1:08:58] man that's time we turn it on he always
[1:09:00] talking about how much a loser you are
[1:09:02] won't you tell him what a loser he is
[1:09:03] you
[1:09:06] loser you
[1:09:10] loser sure you're going to go from here
[1:09:12] and you're going to go through difficult
[1:09:14] times you're you're going to go through
[1:09:15] trials you're going to go through issues
[1:09:17] and situations but let's make this
[1:09:20] determination you ready with me if there
[1:09:23] is a next Camp if there is a next
[1:09:25] service at my home church I'm going in
[1:09:28] as a
[1:09:35] winner I am going in as a winner I'm
[1:09:38] going in as an overcomer I'm going in as
[1:09:41] a
[1:09:46] finisher too many of you have left with
[1:09:49] a victory and come back a loser but this
[1:09:52] Camp I'm not leaving with With Victory
[1:09:54] and coming back with a loser if there is
[1:09:56] another Camp I'm coming back with
[1:10:10] Victory hallelujah it's going to pay pay
[1:10:14] you going have to pay a price but it's
[1:10:16] worth
[1:10:17] it amen Paul looked at that in
[1:10:20] Philippians 3 he says not as though I've
[1:10:21] already obtained either were all already
[1:10:23] perfected but I follow after if that I
[1:10:26] may have apprehend that which is also I
[1:10:28] am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren
[1:10:30] I count not myself to apprehended but
[1:10:32] this one thing I do forgetting those
[1:10:35] things which are
[1:10:39] behind forgetting those things so in
[1:10:43] other words losing that loser
[1:10:47] mentality amen the past leave the past
[1:10:50] in the
[1:10:52] past
[1:10:55] Hallelujah reaching forth to those
[1:10:57] things which are before I press toward
[1:11:00] the mark for the prize of the high
[1:11:02] calling I
[1:11:04] press that's not easy I
[1:11:08] press amen the Bible says resist the
[1:11:11] devil and he will flee from
[1:11:14] you it's a
[1:11:16] resistance it's a pushing out it's a say
[1:11:19] no devil not
[1:11:21] today no you get away from for me Satan
[1:11:24] That's Not My
[1:11:27] Thoughts that's exactly what a
[1:11:29] weightlifter goes through they use
[1:11:30] resistance to get
[1:11:33] stronger Hallelujah every time you
[1:11:36] resist you come back stronger you resist
[1:11:39] and you come back stronger you resist
[1:11:41] and you come back
[1:11:44] stronger keep resisting the devil and
[1:11:47] he'll flee from you he realize I ain't
[1:11:50] big enough I ain't strong enough I can't
[1:11:52] do nothing about that s it's over
[1:12:01] with Hallelujah anyhow I'm not going to
[1:12:05] let the devil get me
[1:12:11] down 1 Corinthians 9 says know you not
[1:12:14] 24 know you not that they which run the
[1:12:16] r run in the race run off but one
[1:12:19] receiveth the prize who he who crosses
[1:12:22] the finish line
[1:12:24] so run that you may obtain every man
[1:12:26] that striveth for the Mastery is
[1:12:28] tempered in all things now they do it to
[1:12:31] obtain a corruptible Crown but we an
[1:12:33] Incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[1:12:36] uncertainly so fight I as not one that
[1:12:39] beateth the air but I keep under my body
[1:12:43] and bring it into
[1:12:45] subjection lest by any means when I
[1:12:48] preach to others I myself should be a
[1:12:52] Castaway
[1:12:57] you have to Die
[1:12:59] daily this old flesh tries to rise up
[1:13:02] every day resist
[1:13:05] it for second Timothy 4:6 for I am now
[1:13:08] ready to be offered and the time of my
[1:13:10] departure is at hand I have fought a
[1:13:12] good fight I have finished my course I
[1:13:15] have kept the faith henceforth there is
[1:13:17] laid for me a crown of righteousness
[1:13:19] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[1:13:22] give me at that day and not to me only
[1:13:24] but unto all them also that love his
[1:13:30] appearing so you want a crown of
[1:13:33] righteousness love his
[1:13:36] appearing well I'm looking for that
[1:13:38] Rapture listen he appears in every
[1:13:42] service but some people don't love is
[1:13:44] appearing enough to come to
[1:13:47] [Applause]
[1:13:49] church amen you know why cuz they got a
[1:13:51] bunch of loser mentality
[1:13:55] and I'm going to deal with this for just
[1:13:56] a moment so bear with me you know what
[1:13:58] loser mentality is is blame others when
[1:14:00] you
[1:14:02] fail it's refusing to change when you're
[1:14:05] presented with the truth that you're
[1:14:09] wrong it means you don't ever learn from
[1:14:12] your mistakes you keep making the same
[1:14:15] mistakes over and over and
[1:14:18] over you have a my way or the highway
[1:14:22] attitude
[1:14:25] oh yeah allowing others people to
[1:14:27] completely or somebody or something some
[1:14:30] devil to Define who you are and you just
[1:14:32] go along with whatever he
[1:14:38] says amen you you choose not to stand up
[1:14:42] for truth and for
[1:14:45] righteousness you say well I failed and
[1:14:47] there's nothing I can do failure is the
[1:14:49] end of my road that's a loser mentality
[1:14:54] you have a should have or a would have
[1:14:56] or a could have or why
[1:14:59] me I knew it was going to get a little
[1:15:01] quiet for just a
[1:15:03] moment you're feeling bad for yourself
[1:15:06] but not doing anything to change
[1:15:13] it I just looked up some things on
[1:15:15] winners and losers so just bear with me
[1:15:17] for a minute a winner is always ready to
[1:15:20] tackle something a loser is prone to
[1:15:22] believe it can't be
[1:15:24] done a winner makes mistakes and says
[1:15:27] I'm wrong a loser makes mistakes and
[1:15:29] says it wasn't my
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:36] fault a winner is challenged by a
[1:15:39] problem and goes through it a loser will
[1:15:41] never face the problem and tries to go
[1:15:44] around it but never gets by
[1:15:49] it a winter realizes there's no time
[1:15:52] like the present to get a job done a
[1:15:54] loser begins to procrastinate with the
[1:15:57] hope that tomorrow is g to be a better
[1:15:59] day I'll get it done
[1:16:07] tomorrow I hope you didn't bring your
[1:16:09] eggs and your tomatoes and
[1:16:10] stuff a winner thinks positively acts
[1:16:14] positive lives positive a loser usually
[1:16:17] has a negative attitude and a negative
[1:16:19] approach to
[1:16:22] everything
[1:16:24] a winner says let's find out a loser
[1:16:27] says nobody
[1:16:29] knows a winner says I'm good but I'm not
[1:16:32] good as I should be a loser says I'm not
[1:16:35] as bad as everybody
[1:16:40] [Applause]
[1:16:47] else amen a winner makes commitments a
[1:16:51] loser makes empty promises
[1:16:55] es a winner learns from those who are
[1:16:58] superior a loser tries to tear down
[1:17:01] those that are
[1:17:04] superior a winner Works harder than a
[1:17:06] loser and has more time a loser is
[1:17:09] always too busy to do what's
[1:17:12] necessary a winner shows he's sorry by
[1:17:15] making it up for it a loser says I'm
[1:17:17] sorry but does the same thing the next
[1:17:22] time amen a winner knows what's to fight
[1:17:25] for and what to compromise on a loser
[1:17:28] compromises on what he shouldn't and
[1:17:31] fights for what isn't worth fighting
[1:17:38] for a winner listens a loser just wants
[1:17:42] to
[1:17:44] talk brother Timothy this ain't the
[1:17:47] service I was looking for well glory to
[1:17:50] God
[1:17:52] anyhow I want you I can't help this
[1:17:55] y'all got t-shirts and y'all got things
[1:17:57] that says anointed to win but don't you
[1:17:58] dare put that t-shirt on with some loser
[1:18:04] mentality you ain't got a right to wear
[1:18:06] it unless you're a
[1:18:16] winner
[1:18:20] Hallelujah a winner is always part of
[1:18:22] the answer a loser is always part of the
[1:18:25] problem a winner has a plan a loser has
[1:18:28] an
[1:18:31] excuse a winner says let me do it a
[1:18:34] loser says that's not my
[1:18:39] job W there some Devil's getting stomped
[1:18:41] this morning a winner sees the answer to
[1:18:45] the problem I to answer for every
[1:18:47] problem a loser sees a problem for every
[1:18:50] answer a winner says it's too difficult
[1:18:53] it may be too may be difficult but it's
[1:18:56] POS possible a loser said it may be
[1:18:58] possible but it's too difficult winners
[1:19:01] have dreams losers have
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:10] schemes winners are a part of the team
[1:19:14] losers are a part from the
[1:19:21] team oh Jesus amen winners see the gain
[1:19:27] losers see nothing but the
[1:19:32] pain winners see
[1:19:34] possibilities losers see nothing but
[1:19:39] problems winners believe in win win
[1:19:41] losers believe if I win somebody's going
[1:19:44] to
[1:19:45] lose winners see potential losers see
[1:19:49] the
[1:19:51] past
[1:19:54] that's why God looks at you and he don't
[1:19:56] see the past he sees your
[1:20:00] potential cuz he's not a
[1:20:04] loser he's a
[1:20:07] winner and he SE something on the inside
[1:20:10] of you the devil he looks at you and
[1:20:12] says look at this look at that look what
[1:20:14] you done you know why he's doing that
[1:20:16] cuz he's a
[1:20:18] loser but God sees a potential on the
[1:20:22] inside out of
[1:20:35] you now this one I had to read about
[1:20:37] four times to
[1:20:38] catch
[1:20:40] so winners are like a thermostat losers

[1:22:12] left pretty soon you're going to run out
[1:22:14] of
[1:22:18] pieces amen winners use hard arguments
[1:22:23] but soft words losers use soft arguments
[1:22:27] but hard
[1:22:28] words winners stand firm on V values but
[1:22:33] they will compromise on Petty things so
[1:22:35] if it really doesn't matter it doesn't
[1:22:37] matter but if it matters it matters if
[1:22:40] it's the word of God it
[1:22:41] matters but if it's just your opinion it
[1:22:44] don't
[1:22:48] matter listen we can go through this
[1:22:50] building of of all the how many how many
[1:22:52] likes a peon pie how many likes a cherry
[1:22:54] pie how many what's your favorite pie
[1:22:55] you know all kind favorite
[1:22:57] cake everybody have a different opinion
[1:23:00] but you know what that is it's just an
[1:23:04] opinion brother Daniel Williams I don't
[1:23:06] know many of y'all probably don't even
[1:23:07] know him but he was a a soldier in the
[1:23:10] in the army of the Lord in the very
[1:23:12] early days of of these camp meetings and
[1:23:14] things in the beginning of our camp
[1:23:15] meeting and he said these things that
[1:23:17] stuck with me he said opinions are just
[1:23:19] like
[1:23:20] noses everybody has one
[1:23:25] yeah but it doesn't mean that your nose
[1:23:28] means more than somebody else's
[1:23:31] [Laughter]
[1:23:33] nose
[1:23:37] Hallelujah but losers will stand firm on
[1:23:39] Petty
[1:23:42] things and they'll compromise on True
[1:23:48] Values winers say do unto others as you
[1:23:50] would have them do unto you loser says
[1:23:53] do it to others before they do it to
[1:23:58] you but you know we got to get the C out

[1:26:30] exactly what it means all
[1:26:32] things it don't take too much of a
[1:26:34] dictionary to understand all things but

[1:27:07] peace of God rule my heart and I'll re
[1:27:09] I'll refuse to worry about
[1:27:13] anything oh that's a hard one but it's
[1:27:15] the truth amen Proverbs 3:5 says trust
[1:27:18] in the Lord with all your heart and lean
[1:27:19] not into your own understanding and all
[1:27:22] your way submit to him and he will make
[1:27:24] your path straight Isaiah 54 says no
[1:27:27] weapon formed against me shall prosper
[1:27:30] and every tongue formed against me shall
[1:27:31] be condemned my righteousness is of the
[1:27:35] Lord Revelation 12 says I am an
[1:27:38] overcomer I have overcome by the blood
[1:27:40] of the lamb and the word of my
[1:27:45] testimony James 4 said I am submitted to
[1:27:48] God and the devil flees from me because
[1:27:51] I resist him
[1:27:54] him Psalms 46 says God is my refuge and
[1:27:59] strength he is my well-proven help in
[1:28:01] the time of
[1:28:02] trouble Romans 8:37 said no in all these
[1:28:06] things we are more than
[1:28:10] conquerors amen I'm not just a conqueror
[1:28:13] I'm more than a
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:20] conqueror I don't remember exactly how

[1:28:28] Muhammad Ali had made up his mind he's
[1:28:30] going to get on the ropes and he gets on
[1:28:33] the ropes and he's letting George George
[1:28:35] is hitting him with everything he's got
[1:28:36] George been had never lost so he'd never
[1:28:38] lost a fight he he is a big Punch Out
[1:28:40] guy he knocked people out in the first
[1:28:42] round first few seconds didn't matter
[1:28:43] and here he is flailing and flailing
[1:28:45] flailing and Mohammed just dodging and
[1:28:47] dodging and moving and
[1:28:50] moving finally got him up there close
[1:28:53] enough old Muhammad Ali pulled old
[1:28:55] George up and said is that all you
[1:28:59] got
[1:29:01] on could you imagine yeah this man been
[1:29:05] knocking people out and he's been giving
[1:29:08] every his best shots toward this man
[1:29:09] been giving it giving it giving it

[1:29:24] there was something on the inside of him
[1:29:26] amen that would fight and keep on
[1:29:28] fighting amen but he let him get all
[1:29:30] wore out but about the seventh eighth
[1:29:33] round whatever it was he said it was
[1:29:34] time to come off the
[1:29:37] ropes and he started taking the fight to
[1:29:39] old George and he knocked him
