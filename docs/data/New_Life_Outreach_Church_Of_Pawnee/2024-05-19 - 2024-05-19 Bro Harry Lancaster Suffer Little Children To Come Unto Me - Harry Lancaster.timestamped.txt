[35:28] 18 and we'll start at verse
[35:42] 15 and they brought unto him also
[35:44] infants that he would touch them but
[35:46] when his disciples saw it they rebuked
[35:48] them but Jesus called them unto him and
[35:51] said suffer little children to come unto
[35:53] me and forbid them not for as such is
[35:57] the kingdom of god let's turn to 1 John
[36:00] chapter
[36:11] 3 1 John chapter 3 and we'll just start
[36:14] at verse
[36:20] one behold what manner of love the
[36:22] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[36:25] should be called the sons of God
[36:27] therefore the world knoweth us not
[36:29] because it knew him not beloved now are
[36:33] we the sons of God and it doth not yet
[36:36] appear that we shall be but we know that
[36:38] when he shall appear we shall be like
[36:41] him for we shall see him as he
[36:44] is let's go ahead and bow our
[36:48] heads Lord Jesus we come into your

[37:30] morning I'm I'm nervous I I feel
[37:32] unworthy but Lord I know that you're
[37:34] able to to take control that you're able
[37:36] to to use the vessel Lord Jesus and Lord
[37:40] I pray that you would help me to
[37:41] surrender Lord Jesus Lord help the the
[37:43] people to to listen with ears to hear
[37:46] and hearts to understand Lord and may
[37:48] you take control and be able to minister
[37:50] to the hearts and meet the needs of the
[37:51] people Lord we lord we just we love you
[37:55] we just commit the remain of the service
[37:57] into your hands in the name of Lord
[37:59] Jesus Christ we pray amen youall may
[38:02] have your
[38:03] seats now in the sermon let your light
[38:07] so shine before men brother brandom said
[38:11] May our hearts be like little children
[38:13] and we want to be that way Lord simple
[38:15] in our life just nothing high-headed
[38:18] nothing hoty but just simple like little
[38:21] children to love you and Obey you and
[38:23] serve you we know that we don't look for
[38:26] wisdom of this world because because
[38:27] it's foolishness to God we look for the
[38:30] mercy of God and we pray that you'll
[38:32] give Mercy to all those who who are
[38:34] seeking mercy and it is written the
[38:36] merciful shall obtain
[38:45] mercy
[38:49] so I was looking
[38:52] at this verse in Luke where it says to
[38:56] suffer the little children to to come
[38:57] unto me and forbid them
[39:00] not and we live in a society today where
[39:04] children are often looked down upon or
[39:07] viewed as trouble and
[39:10] inconvenience um they don't hold the
[39:13] same
[39:14] value today that they have when you look
[39:17] back through history and you look back
[39:19] over
[39:20] time brother brandom even talked about
[39:23] how often you would have the woman that
[39:25] had her little dog instead of
[39:28] having a child or doing this out of the
[39:30] other and we see that in society where
[39:32] people will have oh these are my my my
[39:34] fur babies these are my whatever and
[39:37] these are where all the focus is is on
[39:39] these animals that they
[39:41] have and I already see some laughing
[39:44] because they call their animals fur
[39:45] babies but it's not because they don't
[39:47] want children uh so there is a
[39:49] difference there
[39:52] um but this is very different from what
[39:55] God's instructions were I mean when we
[39:57] go back in Genesis both chapter 1 ver 28
[40:02] and chapter 9 ver1 God commands be
[40:05] fruitful and multiply the value on
[40:08] children is also
[40:10] demonstrated when you go through the
[40:12] verses that cover the women who
[40:15] struggled with barrenness or infertility
[40:18] think about Sarah or Rachel or Hannah
[40:22] God places great value on children so
[40:25] when God calls us his child we know that
[40:28] he also places great value on us we can
[40:31] follow the type out that God places this
[40:34] value on children so if we are the
[40:36] children of God then that same great
[40:38] value is placed on us when we continue
[40:40] forward with
[40:42] it Psalms chapter
[40:46] 127 beginning at verse three it says lo
[40:48] children are in Heritage of the Lord and
[40:51] the fruit of the womb is his reward as
[40:54] arrows are in the hand of a mighty man
[40:56] so are children of the youth happy is
[40:58] the man that hath his quiver full of
[41:00] them they shall not be ashamed but they
[41:02] shall speak with the enemies in the
[41:05] gate and while yes this is speaking
[41:07] about natural children at the same time
[41:10] you can take these verses and you can
[41:12] see the thoughts of our Heavenly fathers
[41:15] he says that children are Heritage they
[41:19] are as arrows in the hands of a mighty
[41:21] man come on and yes we can talk about
[41:24] that as we look at our natural children
[41:26] but it's so much more when you look at
[41:28] it from the spiritual standpoint as God
[41:31] goes you're my children so you're my
[41:34] arrows in the hand of a mighty warrior
[41:36] and we know that God is the ultimate
[41:38] mighty warrior he's above any other
[41:40] mighty warrior that could be so if
[41:42] anyone could fully wield arrows
[41:45] successfully it would be God he would be
[41:48] the one that could truly send them to
[41:50] hit the mark the way that they're
[41:51] supposed to that's right in Ephesians
[41:54] chapter
[41:55] 1 starting at verse three it says
[41:58] blessed be the God and father of our
[42:00] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[42:03] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[42:05] places in Christ according as he hath
[42:07] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[42:09] of the world that we should be holy and
[42:12] Without Blame before him in love having
[42:14] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[42:17] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[42:19] according to the good pleasure of his
[42:24] will Matthew chapter 18
[42:27] starting at verse
[42:29] one it says at the same time came the
[42:32] disciples unto Jesus saying who is the
[42:34] greatest in the kingdom of heaven and
[42:37] Jesus called a little child unto him and
[42:38] set him in the midst of them and said
[42:40] verily I say unto you except you be
[42:42] converted and become as Little Children
[42:45] You shall not enter into the Kingdom of
[42:47] Heaven whosoever therefore shall humble
[42:50] himself as this little child the same as
[42:52] greatest in the kingdom of heaven and
[42:55] who so shall receive one such little
[42:56] child in my name receiveth me but who so
[43:00] shall offend one of these little ones
[43:02] which believe in me it were better for
[43:04] him that a millstone were hanged about
[43:06] his neck and that he were drowned in the
[43:08] depths of the
[43:12] sea now I don't know how many of you
[43:16] have experienced this before I'd be
[43:18] willing to bet many of you have but my
[43:20] wife is very much a person that if
[43:23] someone messes with her
[43:25] children the mama bear is coming out oh
[43:28] yeah and she's not going to be real
[43:30] happy about it now sometimes she can
[43:34] hold it back so they don't know about it
[43:36] I hear about
[43:37] it the person that did something may not
[43:40] hear about it from my wife but the mama
[43:42] bear comes out to protect her Cubs to
[43:44] protect her children okay and here God
[43:48] is saying the same thing hey if you mess
[43:49] with my
[43:52] children if you mess with one of mine it
[43:55] would be better if you were drowned in
[43:58] the sea it would be better if this
[44:00] happened or that happened and so we can
[44:02] even look at that as how often is the
[44:05] devil messing with each one of us how
[44:07] often is the devil trying to bother us
[44:11] and God is saying even in this verse
[44:13] going very clearly he's got
[44:17] his end coming he's going to get his
[44:20] just desserts for everything that he's
[44:22] done there is no mama bear or papa bear
[44:26] like God there is no one that will
[44:29] respond the same
[44:31] way now when I look at that when I was
[44:34] looking at that verse and Jesus saying
[44:36] suffer the little children to come unto
[44:38] me it made me think a little bit
[44:41] and most of my sermons when I preach
[44:45] come because I get a question in my mind
[44:48] and start thinking about something about
[44:50] well why is this this way or what is
[44:52] this doing and so I was looking at this
[44:54] verse and says suffer the little
[44:55] children and most commonly we use this
[44:58] verse when where children are coming up
[45:01] for dedication or those kind of things
[45:04] but I started thinking about I'm like
[45:05] okay so what do you think of when you
[45:10] think of a little child when you think
[45:13] of the little child are you thinking of
[45:15] the
[45:16] newborn in your mind because each of us
[45:18] picture something it's like are you
[45:19] thinking of the
[45:21] toddler are you thinking of a schoolage
[45:23] child or you thinking of a pre-teen or a
[45:26] teenager
[45:28] what are you picturing in your mind when
[45:30] we read that verse suffer the little
[45:33] child and it may be kind of a range but
[45:35] you kind of picture in your mind okay
[45:37] Jesus having these different children
[45:38] come up whatever it
[45:42] is but I really think that if we take
[45:45] this and we look at it in a spiritual
[45:47] sense when God is talking about the
[45:49] little children I believe he's speaking
[45:50] about every single one of us yes he is
[45:53] speaking about the little ones that are
[45:55] sitting on the front row and he's also
[45:57] speaking about the elders that are
[45:59] sitting towards the back row he's
[46:02] talking about each one of us as his
[46:03] little child and he's saying suffer them
[46:06] to come unto me every single one we all
[46:09] fall into this category of suffer the
[46:11] little child to come unto
[46:13] me Romans 10:13 says for whosoever shall
[46:17] call upon the name of the Lord shall be
[46:20] saved now whosoever covers a broad range
[46:23] it doesn't just cover the little
[46:24] children it covers all of us
[46:27] so when Jesus says suffer the little
[46:30] children to come unto
[46:31] me my thoughts continued to progress I'm
[46:34] like okay
[46:36] so what is
[46:39] it that children need from their parents
[46:42] when you look at the different stages of
[46:44] life that they go
[46:46] through as I've slowly developed a
[46:49] larger range of Ages with my kids I have
[46:52] very much learned that the way that I
[46:55] treat one is not the way that I
[46:57] treat the other not only because of
[47:00] their personalities but even because of
[47:03] their ages the way that they're able to
[47:05] handle responsibility the way that
[47:06] they're able to handle this or handle
[47:08] that you have to give each one a little
[47:11] bit different type of attention or
[47:13] different type of care because of where
[47:16] they're at along life's
[47:20] journey now obviously when we're dealing
[47:23] with the newborn and I want you all
[47:25] we're going to be talking in the natural
[47:27] but I still want you to be thinking in
[47:28] the spiritual as we're going so you know
[47:31] when we're talking about that newborn
[47:34] babe we've got little Juniper back there
[47:37] that my wife's holding
[47:39] and the newborn that comes in is utterly
[47:43] helpless the newborn that comes in
[47:47] is looking for love and nourishment it's
[47:52] pretty much the requirements this is
[47:54] this is what I need I need you to
[47:57] nourish me I need you to care for
[48:00] me I don't need you to give me
[48:02] responsibilities I don't need you to
[48:04] give me tasks or chores to
[48:06] do I just need you to love and nourish
[48:09] me that's what what we
[48:12] have and when we start our journey and
[48:16] are born again most of the time we have
[48:19] little to no
[48:21] understanding we know I've accepted God
[48:23] as my
[48:24] savior that's about it we don't really
[48:27] understand what faith is that's right we
[48:30] don't really understand you know we're
[48:31] not going to go through and explain to
[48:33] you all the secrets in the Bible we
[48:35] don't we don't we haven't learned all
[48:37] this we haven't begun to grow or develop
[48:39] we're still in that newborn
[48:42] stage we don't necessarily understand
[48:44] Faith but we have enough faith that when
[48:48] we that we know that when we cry we will
[48:50] receive what we have need
[48:53] of little
[48:55] Juniper can't call out to
[48:59] Mama and use her name and say I want
[49:04] food as brother Brandon would talk about
[49:07] you can't train a baby to ring a bell
[49:10] that hey I I I I need to eat or I need
[49:12] to be
[49:13] changed yes sir but she has she knows
[49:18] that if she cries she will be taken care
[49:21] of because that's what God has given her
[49:24] God has given her the ability to cry
[49:27] and then it's up to Mama to figure out
[49:28] what is this cry for is it for food is
[49:30] it for I need to be changed is it I just
[49:32] need to be loved what is it you're
[49:35] looking for it's up to Mama to figure
[49:37] that out Juniper just knows to cry the
[49:40] baby just knows to
[49:42] cry and when we particularly when we're
[49:44] first coming in that's all we know to do
[49:47] is to cry out to
[49:49] God sometimes and particularly when
[49:52] we're talking with the little ones like
[49:53] there are times when we pray and we
[49:56] don't even know the words to
[49:57] say we're not sure how to try to
[49:59] describe what we're feeling we're not
[50:01] sure how to try to describe the
[50:04] situation we're going through or even
[50:05] what we need from God other than to say
[50:07] God I need
[50:10] you and we're sitting there and we're
[50:12] trusting God as the great father to know
[50:14] this is actually what you need you may
[50:16] not be able to tell me but I know what
[50:18] you need and I can supply that need I
[50:20] can provide for
[50:23] you 2 Corinthians chapter 9
[50:27] starting at verse
[50:29] 8 it said and God is able to make all
[50:31] grace abound toward you that ye always
[50:34] having all sufficiency in all things may
[50:37] abound to every good work as it is
[50:40] written he hath dispersed abroad he hath
[50:42] given to the poor his righteousness
[50:44] remaineth forever now he that
[50:47] ministereth seeds to the Sewer both
[50:49] Minister bread for your food and
[50:51] multiply your seed sown and increase the
[50:54] fruits of your righteousness being
[50:56] enriched in everything to all
[50:57] bountifulness which causeth through US
[51:00] Thanksgiving to God for the
[51:02] administration of this service not only
[51:04] Supply at the want of the Saints but is
[51:07] abundant also by many thanksgivings unto
[51:09] God okay Philippians chapter 4 and verse
[51:13] 19 but my God shall supply all your
[51:16] needs according to his riches in Glory
[51:18] by Christ
[51:21] Jesus God is able to give us everything
[51:23] that we have need of it doesn't mean
[51:26] that he gives us everything we want it
[51:28] doesn't mean that he gives us everything
[51:31] that we think we
[51:32] need but he knows what our needs are and
[51:35] he's going to make sure that we have
[51:36] them when we're crying out and we're
[51:38] going Lord I need you Lord I
[51:41] need
[51:44] something and even as we get further in
[51:46] walk sometimes as we get further along
[51:49] in our walk with the Lord we'll still
[51:51] digress back to the baby stage and go
[51:52] Lord I don't know what I need but I need
[51:55] something
[51:56] I'm sitting in this spot right
[51:58] now and I'm I'm just going to be a baby
[52:01] cuz I don't know what to ask
[52:04] for but I know that you know what I need
[52:08] so Lord I'm just asking that you now
[52:10] Supply that you now provide what I
[52:13] actually need not just what I'm looking
[52:14] for but what I truly
[52:20] need now after we go
[52:23] from the newborn stage you have
[52:27] those that are a
[52:28] toddler for me I've got little
[52:31] silus looks like he's trying to go to
[52:33] sleep over there
[52:37] and I can't remember if my older kids
[52:39] did
[52:41] this but silus has this thing where when
[52:44] I hold
[52:46] him and he'll be talking to
[52:49] me I don't necessarily understand what
[52:51] he's saying but he's talking to me about
[52:53] something and he'll be pointing at
[52:55] whatever and and I will turn to look at
[52:57] whatever and he will reach up and grab
[53:00] my face and turn it back towards him and
[53:01] go no you're looking at me even if he's
[53:04] pointing at something I'm not supposed
[53:05] to look there I'm supposed to look at
[53:07] him he I he has to have all my attention
[53:11] there is there is no it's like great
[53:13] he's talking about the bird I'm not
[53:16] allowed to look at the bird because if I
[53:18] look there he's going to grab my face
[53:19] and pull it back and go no I'm talking
[53:21] right now I'm telling you about the bird
[53:23] so look at me pay attention to me
[53:31] when at that toddler stage he just
[53:35] wants our
[53:38] attention yes he still
[53:41] needs us to sustain him he still needs
[53:44] food he still needs us to love him but
[53:47] he wants our attention he wants us to be
[53:50] focused on
[53:52] him not kind of listening to him while I
[53:55] look at my phone or or not doing this or
[53:58] doing that he wants
[54:00] undivided
[54:02] attention he wants I contact me looking
[54:05] directly at him so that he knows my
[54:09] focus is on
[54:11] him and he'll do the exact same thing
[54:13] with my wife if he's talking to her
[54:15] he'll grab her face and turn it around
[54:17] when she starts to look away as no this
[54:19] is about me right now I want you to look
[54:22] at
[54:24] me at that at that stage he still
[54:27] doesn't understand a whole
[54:29] lot he still doesn't have a lot of
[54:32] wisdom he still doesn't have a lot of
[54:33] this but he
[54:37] basks in the parents
[54:40] attention he basks in the parents
[54:45] focus and those are the times we have
[54:48] the baby stage where we're just crying
[54:51] we don't know what we're asking for we
[54:52] don't know what we're doing we're just
[54:54] asking God to take care of us and then
[54:56] the toddler stage and we're just so
[54:58] focused on we just want to know that
[55:01] God sees us we want to have his
[55:05] attention and at the same time that's
[55:08] the attention God
[55:09] wants I mean it's one of those I can't
[55:12] get annoyed with him with my little boy
[55:14] when he grabs my face and pulls it
[55:15] around I'm just
[55:17] laughing because he's doing the same
[55:19] thing he's looking me right eye to eye
[55:21] he's focused on
[55:23] me and it's just it's cute it's it's
[55:26] adorable it's
[55:28] great if that's what I can feel as a
[55:31] natural father how much more is God
[55:33] feeling this when going Lord I just I
[55:36] just want some communion right now I
[55:38] just want come on to talk to you I want
[55:41] to hear you talk back I want to hear
[55:44] your
[55:46] voice I want to know that you hear
[55:49] me and I just want your attention I want
[55:53] your
[55:54] presence yes Lord I want you to feed me
[55:57] yes Lord I want to know that you love me
[55:59] but I want your attention I want your
[56:02] focus and I want to give you my
[56:04] attention and my focus cuz that's how
[56:07] important you are to me come
[56:09] on I I was waiting for it as silus has
[56:13] been growing it's just been within the
[56:15] past few days that
[56:18] suddenly my buddy cuz he's been a
[56:21] daddy's
[56:22] boy my buddy has suddenly gotten focused
[56:25] on Mama
[56:26] because Mama's busy with a baby and
[56:29] she's
[56:30] distracted and he wants her attention
[56:33] back and suddenly daddy is not quite as
[56:35] important as he used to
[56:37] be I know it's a phase I know I grew out
[56:39] of it but it hurts just a little
[56:43] bit and instead of climbing in my lap
[56:45] he'll run over and try to climb in
[56:47] Stephanie's lap while Stephanie's
[56:48] holding
[56:52] Juniper and yet that's how often do we
[56:56] let that kind of thing slip in between
[56:59] us and
[57:00] God
[57:01] where we were giving God all of our
[57:04] Focus we were giving God all of our
[57:05] attention then we noticed something else
[57:07] and we're distracted come on now there
[57:10] is nothing wrong with Silas wanting his
[57:12] mom's attention nothing
[57:17] wrong but there's something wrong when
[57:20] our attention starts to get pulled away
[57:23] from God because we're distracted by
[57:24] something else
[57:27] because we're looking in a different
[57:28] direction because our focus is
[57:31] changing when that's supposed to be the
[57:34] one who gets our all that's
[57:38] right 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse
[57:43] 12 for the eyes of the Lord are over the
[57:46] righteous and his ears are open unto
[57:48] their
[57:49] prayers but the face of the Lord is
[57:51] against them that do
[57:54] evil Luke chap 12:
[57:58] 6 are not five sparrows sold for two
[58:01] Farthing and not one of them is
[58:03] forgotten before God but even the very
[58:06] hairs of your head are all numbered fear
[58:09] not therefore ye are of more value than
[58:11] many
[58:13] sparrows God is never one that
[58:19] is going to stop watching us that's
[58:23] right when we're praying when when we're
[58:26] talking he's still
[58:28] there now we might be going through a
[58:30] time
[58:32] where it doesn't feel like he is maybe
[58:36] it doesn't feel like he's paying
[58:40] attention but he's still watching and
[58:43] his ears are still open for the prayers
[58:44] of the
[58:48] righteous he promises
[58:52] that you know as we go on from
[58:57] this toddler you begin to go into the
[58:59] school age which we have quite a few of
[59:02] those on the front row I'm going to pick
[59:05] out simy and and
[59:08] kylin falling into this this school age
[59:12] where they're beginning to receive
[59:15] instruction they're beginning to to
[59:17] learn they're beginning to
[59:20] grow and a lot of it at that age they
[59:23] want their questions
[59:24] answered I think every parent in here
[59:27] has heard the question why so many times
[59:30] well why well why and you answer and
[59:33] they say well why and why and you can
[59:36] run that Circle over and over and over
[59:39] because they will always keep asking why
[59:42] maybe change it to what now and then or
[59:45] who but they're going to keep asking
[59:47] well why well why well why because they
[59:51] want to know they want to learn and they
[59:53] want you to be able to answer their
[59:56] questions
[59:57] yes they're looking for
[1:00:01] encouragement they want to know that you
[1:00:04] are impressed or happy by what they're
[1:00:07] able to
[1:00:09] do they're looking for
[1:00:13] acceptance that you like them for who
[1:00:16] they
[1:00:17] are you like them even though they may
[1:00:19] be different than their brother or
[1:00:21] sister or they may be different than the
[1:00:23] kid down the block or the kid in church
[1:00:26] they want to know that you like them for
[1:00:31] them simey doesn't wants you to be
[1:00:34] looking at him going man I wish you were
[1:00:36] more like
[1:00:38] kylin kylin doesn't want to be looked at
[1:00:40] with people going man I wish he was more
[1:00:41] like
[1:00:42] Simi they want people to like them and
[1:00:46] accept them for who they are yeah
[1:00:49] because Sime is
[1:00:53] him he is the least around me a little
[1:00:57] bit quieter
[1:00:58] one doesn't say a whole
[1:01:02] lot not quite as active as kylin he's
[1:01:06] got his own own pace to life kylin runs
[1:01:10] everywhere yeah that boy has so much
[1:01:15] energy and God has made each one of them
[1:01:18] special
[1:01:19] and each one of them want to
[1:01:22] be recognized and accepted and
[1:01:26] approved of for who they are that's
[1:01:28] right not for what they do wrong we're
[1:01:32] not saying we approve of sin or we
[1:01:34] approve of that but the way that God has
[1:01:36] made
[1:01:37] them that they're accepted for that
[1:01:40] personality and even we in our own
[1:01:42] Journey we we know God's not going to
[1:01:45] prove sin but we want to know that God
[1:01:48] loves us for who we are for who he's
[1:01:51] made us to be for who he's designed us
[1:01:53] to be
[1:01:58] it's a time when we're going through so
[1:02:01] much education we're learning so many
[1:02:03] different
[1:02:04] things you know the three Rs Reading
[1:02:06] Writing arithmetic they're getting all
[1:02:08] this thrown at them and they're learning
[1:02:10] so much about life and the way the world
[1:02:13] Works Proverbs Chapter 1 and verse
[1:02:16] 8 my son hear the instructions of thy
[1:02:19] father and forsake not the law of thy
[1:02:24] mother 1 John chap 5 and verse
[1:02:29] 14 and this is the confidence that we
[1:02:31] have in him if we ask anything according
[1:02:34] to his will he heareth us and if we know
[1:02:37] that he hear us whatever we ask we know
[1:02:39] that we have the petitions that we
[1:02:40] desired of
[1:02:43] him Jeremiah 33 and
[1:02:48] verse3 call unto me and I will answer
[1:02:51] thee and show thee Great and Mighty
[1:02:53] things which thou knowest not
[1:03:00] we know that God has the answer to every
[1:03:04] question that we come up
[1:03:05] with anything that we don't understand
[1:03:09] or unsure
[1:03:11] of God already
[1:03:14] knows and so we can come to him with our
[1:03:17] questions we can come to him with our
[1:03:18] concerns we can come to him with our
[1:03:21] problems and he's not going to get
[1:03:24] annoyed when we keep asking why
[1:03:26] why like most of us Earthly parents will
[1:03:31] eventually he's not going to get mad
[1:03:34] because we keep
[1:03:36] going well why this or why that unless
[1:03:40] you're coming at him and you're asking
[1:03:41] in some sort of accusing manner like he
[1:03:43] did something wrong but if you're just
[1:03:44] going Lord I just want to know what why
[1:03:47] now he may not answer every time but
[1:03:50] he's not going to get upset that you're
[1:03:51] asking
[1:03:55] we go through this age of instruction
[1:03:57] where he's teaching us and he's showing
[1:04:02] us and we know
[1:04:04] that God accept accepts us because he
[1:04:08] made us he made your personality he made
[1:04:11] you to be the person that you are to
[1:04:14] have the kind of relationship with him
[1:04:18] that you have he didn't create every
[1:04:20] single one of one of us to be the most
[1:04:23] amazing prayer Warrior that can spend
[1:04:24] hours on our knees
[1:04:26] we should all be striving for that I
[1:04:28] understand but we didn't some have it a
[1:04:30] whole lot easier than others it's just
[1:04:31] natural it
[1:04:33] just I'm not
[1:04:35] one I have to work at a lot
[1:04:39] harder God didn't make every one of us
[1:04:42] to have an amazing voice God didn't make
[1:04:46] every one of us to have all kinds of
[1:04:48] musical
[1:04:50] talents God didn't make every one of us
[1:04:54] to
[1:04:55] be in
[1:04:57] Ministry God didn't make every one of us
[1:04:59] to do this or do that but he created
[1:05:02] each one of
[1:05:04] us in a special way and he created each
[1:05:07] one of us with special gifts and special
[1:05:10] callings in our
[1:05:11] lives he created each one of us to
[1:05:14] accomplish certain
[1:05:17] things and he created each one of us
[1:05:19] just the way that he wanted us to
[1:05:23] be Romans chapter 15 and
[1:05:26] verse
[1:05:27] 7 wherefore receive ye one another as
[1:05:30] Christ also received us to the glory of
[1:05:32] God and another translation instead of
[1:05:35] receive it says
[1:05:37] accept accept ye one another as Christ
[1:05:39] also accepted us to the glory of
[1:05:42] God Isaiah 43 and verse
[1:05:46] 1 but now thus sayith the Lord that
[1:05:49] createth thee oh Jacob and he that
[1:05:51] formed thee oh Israel fear not for I
[1:05:54] have redeemed Thee I I have called thee
[1:05:56] by name Thou Art
[1:06:12] mine we go
[1:06:14] through as children they grow through
[1:06:16] and they go through the early school
[1:06:19] years and they go up into the Preen
[1:06:22] years I've got
[1:06:25] over there that is just champing at the
[1:06:27] bit to be a
[1:06:28] teenager he's almost
[1:06:31] there it's coming up he's about to be
[1:06:34] 13 but he's in that pre-teen he's just
[1:06:38] he so much wants to step into it because
[1:06:41] he sees it in his mind it's a step out
[1:06:43] of childhood I'm not a kid I'm a
[1:06:46] teenager I don't think he quite
[1:06:48] understands he's got six years to go at
[1:06:51] that point still get out a teenager
[1:06:55] you know he's got six years of teenager
[1:06:57] to
[1:07:01] go but yet it's a stepping stone I've
[1:07:03] I've come out of being just a kid just a
[1:07:07] child I am
[1:07:08] now moving into it and so he sits in
[1:07:11] this pre-teen
[1:07:14] and he's going through the time where
[1:07:17] we're beginning
[1:07:20] to give him a little more
[1:07:23] responsibility begin to give him a a few
[1:07:26] more tasks that he has to get done
[1:07:28] or a few more things that are expected
[1:07:31] of
[1:07:32] him because he's he's moving towards it
[1:07:35] and so this is his chance to prove
[1:07:37] himself to show that he can handle some
[1:07:42] responsibility you know I've
[1:07:44] got charity over here that falls in the
[1:07:47] the school age group and she can hand a
[1:07:50] little bit of
[1:07:54] responsibility Paul PA is a little bit
[1:07:56] older and so we expect him to be able to
[1:07:58] handle more we expect him to be able to
[1:07:59] step out and right now he's going
[1:08:01] through the test and go okay can he
[1:08:02] actually handle it can he handle some of
[1:08:06] this responsibility can he handle these
[1:08:07] tasks without continually being reminded
[1:08:09] to do it can he do the
[1:08:14] task with Excellence so that he's doing
[1:08:17] the job well that he's getting
[1:08:19] everything done the way that it should
[1:08:20] be
[1:08:28] and with
[1:08:29] that testing and
[1:08:31] responsibility there comes some
[1:08:35] correction as he's learning as he's
[1:08:37] growing he's making
[1:08:39] mistakes and sometimes they're honest
[1:08:42] mistakes that just go okay next time do
[1:08:44] it this way and sometimes there's
[1:08:48] Disobedience that you have to deal with
[1:08:51] you get to see a little bit of both
[1:08:53] going with
[1:08:54] it as he has that chance of
[1:08:57] responsibility there's also the chance
[1:08:58] to abuse it more when there are a lot of
[1:09:01] rules and guidelines they can't go too
[1:09:04] far as you begin to loosen that and give
[1:09:07] them some more
[1:09:09] freedom more things can go
[1:09:14] wrong 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:09:17] 2 and verse three for our exhortation
[1:09:20] was not of Deceit nor of uncleanliness
[1:09:23] and Gile but as we were allowed of God
[1:09:26] to be put in trust with the gospel even
[1:09:28] so we speak not as pleasing men but God
[1:09:34] which trith our hearts God tries our
[1:09:37] hearts he gives us tests to
[1:09:40] see how we can handle it
[1:09:44] sure he'll allow us to go out a little
[1:09:48] bit farther and see are we ready to to
[1:09:51] handle that responsibility are we ready
[1:09:53] to handle this
[1:09:57] Authority sir brother brandham says in
[1:09:59] the sermon and when their eyes were open
[1:10:00] they knew him he says if you can't stand
[1:10:03] the chastisement of God then you're
[1:10:04] illegitimate and not a child of God you
[1:10:07] claim God as your father and you say oh
[1:10:09] I can't believe well that just shows
[1:10:11] that God is not your father see you you
[1:10:14] would get it now notice this testing God
[1:10:17] tests every one of his children all that
[1:10:19] come to him must first be tested tried
[1:10:24] proved Luke 16 starting at verse
[1:10:29] 10 he that is faithful in that which is
[1:10:31] least is faithful also in much he that
[1:10:35] is unjust in the least is unjust also in
[1:10:37] much if therefore you have not been
[1:10:39] faithful in the unrighteous manmon who
[1:10:41] will commit to you your trust the true
[1:10:43] riches and if you have not been faithful
[1:10:46] in that which is another man's who shall
[1:10:48] give you that which is your
[1:10:51] own Romans chapter 14 and verse2
[1:10:56] so then every one of us shall give
[1:10:58] account of himself to
[1:11:02] God Ecclesiastes 12 and verse
[1:11:09] 13 let us hear the conclusion of the
[1:11:11] whole matter fear God and keep his
[1:11:14] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[1:11:16] of man for God shall bring every work
[1:11:19] into judgment with every secret thing
[1:11:21] whether it be good or whether it be evil
[1:11:25] and Deuteronomy chap 24 and:
[1:11:30] 16 the father shall not be put to death
[1:11:33] for the children neither shall the
[1:11:35] children be put to death for the fathers
[1:11:37] every man shall be put to death for his
[1:11:39] own
[1:11:41] sin God tests us and he tests
[1:11:46] us on our own I don't have to answer
[1:11:50] for brother
[1:11:53] Colby brother kby doesn't have to answer
[1:11:56] for me if I mess up God's not holding
[1:12:00] him responsible for
[1:12:04] it the same
[1:12:07] way if I'm parenting correctly then if
[1:12:09] Paul messes up I'm not going to hold
[1:12:11] charity responsible for
[1:12:15] it now I will be the first one to say
[1:12:18] there are
[1:12:21] times when some of my younger children
[1:12:24] are acting
[1:12:26] wild and when we give
[1:12:28] punishment sometimes Luke gets lumped
[1:12:31] into
[1:12:32] it and Luke knows this is true we've had
[1:12:35] to apologize before but there are times
[1:12:37] we just go all right all the children
[1:12:39] this is what's happening and Luke's like
[1:12:41] what did I
[1:12:44] do God doesn't do that that's an Earthly
[1:12:48] parent
[1:12:50] mistake God doesn't do that he doesn't
[1:12:52] wrap us all up and go man you know what
[1:12:56] because sister Sharon messed up the
[1:12:58] whole church is going to suffer that's
[1:13:00] the way it
[1:13:03] works each one of us is going to answer
[1:13:05] for our
[1:13:07] own actions each one of us is
[1:13:09] responsible for our own
[1:13:12] mistakes each one of us has to confest
[1:13:14] to God for our our own situations and
[1:13:17] then
[1:13:18] ask for forgiveness ask for instruction
[1:13:22] ask for overcoming power so that we
[1:13:24] don't continue to fall in the same
[1:13:35] places as they move into the teenage
[1:13:40] years they begin to have the
[1:13:41] introduction to
[1:13:45] adulthood you know I can rely on Luke in
[1:13:49] a lot of ways there are a lot of things
[1:13:51] that I can give him a lot of trust and a
[1:13:53] lot of leeway
[1:13:55] because he's proven himself and he's
[1:13:57] begun to show a level of maturity that
[1:13:59] he can handle certain
[1:14:01] things he's not all the way there yet
[1:14:05] we're still working on it but there are
[1:14:06] a lot of things that I know I can trust
[1:14:09] him beyond what I can his siblings and
[1:14:12] it's not because Paul and charity are
[1:14:14] failures are anyway it's because they're
[1:14:17] younger they haven't gone as far along
[1:14:20] the journey they haven't had the
[1:14:21] opportunity to learn as much to
[1:14:23] experience as much
[1:14:26] and so I can't expect them to be at the
[1:14:29] same
[1:14:30] level but with Luke I
[1:14:33] can give him some more
[1:14:37] privileges knowing that he's not going
[1:14:39] to abuse them or go too far with him I
[1:14:41] can give him added
[1:14:44] responsibility but it also means
[1:14:47] that when there's an
[1:14:49] issue there's probably additional
[1:14:51] punishments that go along with
[1:14:53] him because I've given him him more
[1:14:55] opportunities and more chances and more
[1:15:01] trust and as we're growing with the Lord
[1:15:03] we have the same thing where God
[1:15:06] continues to give you a little bit more
[1:15:08] and a little bit more and okay you were
[1:15:12] good with the little I gave you so I'm
[1:15:13] going to give you a little bit
[1:15:16] more and that could be in the
[1:15:19] natural but it could very much be in the
[1:15:21] spiritual you've been good with this
[1:15:24] portion of your gift you've been good
[1:15:25] with this portion I'm going to open up a
[1:15:28] little bit more to you I'm going to give
[1:15:30] you a little bit greater blessing I'm
[1:15:32] going to give you a little bit more
[1:15:34] Revelation a little bit more
[1:15:36] understanding a little bit
[1:15:37] more take your pick of what you want to
[1:15:39] put on there it doesn't always mean that
[1:15:43] we're going to have the finances raining
[1:15:44] down and suddenly my bank account's
[1:15:47] growing but God's going hey you you
[1:15:49] handled this well so I can trust you
[1:15:51] with a little bit more I can trust you a
[1:15:54] little bit more in this are I can give
[1:15:55] you a little more bit more
[1:15:56] responsibility with this because you've
[1:15:59] proven yourself you've
[1:16:01] demonstrated a maturity you've
[1:16:03] demonstrated a
[1:16:08] relationship and ultimately we begin to
[1:16:10] move to the point that brother
[1:16:13] brandham ministered about where when
[1:16:16] they talk about
[1:16:18] adoption Galatians chapter 4 beginning
[1:16:22] at verse one
[1:16:25] now I say that the heir as long as he is
[1:16:27] a child differeth nothing from a servant
[1:16:29] though he be Lord of all but is under
[1:16:32] tutors and governors until the time
[1:16:34] appointed of the father even so we when
[1:16:37] we were children were in bondage under
[1:16:39] the elements of the world but when the
[1:16:41] fullness of the time was come God sent
[1:16:43] forth his son made of a woman made under
[1:16:45] the law to redeem them that were under
[1:16:47] the law that we might receive the
[1:16:49] adoption of sons and because ye are Sons
[1:16:52] God hath sent forth the spirit of his
[1:16:54] son into your heart
[1:16:55] crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no
[1:16:58] more a servant but a son and if a son
[1:17:01] than an heir of God through
[1:17:04] Christ in the sermon hidden
[1:17:06] life brother brandom says now when this
[1:17:09] boy became of age and when he was ready
[1:17:10] then for his adoption and he had proved
[1:17:13] by the tutor had told the father that
[1:17:15] this boy was eligible for adoption he
[1:17:18] was taken out into a public place and
[1:17:19] there he was robed an honor robe perhaps
[1:17:22] purple or some color of royalty and was
[1:17:25] set up in the whole city all the people
[1:17:27] around about seeing the father adopt his
[1:17:29] own son into the family and then when he
[1:17:32] was adopted into the family already a
[1:17:34] son already a child already an heir of
[1:17:36] Grace but placed in the family you get
[1:17:38] it now when he was placed in the family
[1:17:40] and given his position then the boy's
[1:17:42] name on a check was just as good as his
[1:17:44] father's name on the
[1:17:48] check in adoption number
[1:17:51] four brother brandom says and a man
[1:17:53] that's dead in Christ you can call him
[1:17:55] hypocrite call him anything you want to
[1:17:58] he'll never rise up about it if anything
[1:17:59] he'll slip off somewhere and pray for
[1:18:01] you that's right but oh some of them is
[1:18:03] very much alive that's what I think
[1:18:05] about we're supposed to bury dead people
[1:18:08] them that's dead in Christ we bury in
[1:18:09] water sometimes we bury too many people
[1:18:12] that's alive too much malice and strife
[1:18:14] and there's too much in the church but
[1:18:16] we can't separate that but God does he
[1:18:19] knows his people he knows his sheep he
[1:18:21] knows every voice he knows his children
[1:18:23] he knows who he can call out out he
[1:18:25] knows who he's predestinated he knows
[1:18:27] who he's given these things to what he's
[1:18:29] making himself known through God can put
[1:18:33] confidence in his children on what to do
[1:18:35] knowing that they will do
[1:18:38] exactly and in adoption number two he
[1:18:40] says now when the father in the Old
[1:18:43] Testament understood that his son was
[1:18:45] come of age and had been seasoned out
[1:18:47] unto adoption unto they're born a child
[1:18:50] but they're a son right then but then
[1:18:51] they'll never be more no more than just
[1:18:53] a child just an ordinary son until they
[1:18:55] mature and show what they are then he
[1:18:57] calls them out
[1:18:59] then now here we are church are you
[1:19:01] ready now it's a little bit late
[1:19:02] everybody bite your finger pinch your
[1:19:04] soul pluck your heart just for a minute
[1:19:05] see now we're going to place the church
[1:19:08] now when the church gets to that place
[1:19:10] he says Manasses you belong over here
[1:19:12] Ephraim you over here then he takes him
[1:19:15] out to a certain place the father does
[1:19:16] and he sets him upon a high place like
[1:19:18] this and he has a ceremony and they all
[1:19:20] come around and he says I want everyone
[1:19:22] to know that this is my child and I
[1:19:24] adopt my my son and I want anyone to
[1:19:26] know from hence forth that his name I
[1:19:29] dress him up a special dress on him and
[1:19:30] I want you to know that his name is just
[1:19:32] as good on any check as my name is he's
[1:19:34] my child I adopt him into my family
[1:19:37] although he's been my son since he was
[1:19:38] born since he received the Holy Ghost
[1:19:41] he's been my son but now I'm going to
[1:19:42] place him positionally in Authority what
[1:19:45] he fires is fired what he hires is hired
[1:19:49] and verily verily I say unto you if you
[1:19:50] say to this tree if you say to this
[1:19:52] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[1:19:54] your heart but believe what you've said
[1:19:57] will come to pass you can have what you
[1:19:59] said see there you are there you are see
[1:20:02] he's my son how many knows that the
[1:20:04] adoption that they adopted the son after
[1:20:06] he had proved to be everybody that read
[1:20:08] the Bible placing of a
[1:20:13] son we go through all of this growth we
[1:20:16] go through all these different
[1:20:20] stages and what's
[1:20:22] interesting when you look at it from the
[1:20:25] natural it's fully a progression once
[1:20:28] they're at this stage they don't go
[1:20:30] back to the toddler stage they don't go
[1:20:32] back to the baby
[1:20:34] stage but in our spiritual walk we
[1:20:38] sometimes do bounce around a little
[1:20:40] bit and at the same time in some ways
[1:20:43] even in the natural we
[1:20:45] do in Mother's Day service brother
[1:20:47] Wendell was talking about how he likes
[1:20:49] to go back to his mom and sometimes he
[1:20:51] just goes like I just need to put my
[1:20:53] head on a shoulder I need to cry a
[1:20:54] little a little bit need
[1:20:55] to and all of us have those different
[1:20:58] points where there are
[1:21:00] times even when our older children they
[1:21:02] just
[1:21:04] need our full focus and full
[1:21:08] attention they
[1:21:09] don't want responsibility right at that
[1:21:12] moment they just need some love they
[1:21:14] need Mama's hug they need this they need
[1:21:23] that and there are times as we're going
[1:21:25] through our own spiritual walk where we
[1:21:27] go back and
[1:21:29] like Lord I'm a baby again I don't know
[1:21:32] what I need but Lord I just need you to
[1:21:36] do
[1:21:37] something I need you to move in some
[1:21:40] way I should be old enough to be able to
[1:21:43] explain what I
[1:21:45] need but I can't cuz I don't know I
[1:21:49] can't explain it I don't have the words
[1:21:52] but Lord you know
[1:21:55] and we go back and forth
[1:21:59] and I know that we've
[1:22:03] got my pre-teen that has a little more
[1:22:06] of his Surly days right
[1:22:09] now CU that's the stage he's going
[1:22:12] through but when he goes through the day
[1:22:15] or the moment where he actually wants a
[1:22:19] hug from
[1:22:20] Mom mom loves
[1:22:22] that I expect most of the mom moms
[1:22:24] probably feel that way of hey if the
[1:22:27] child that doesn't really want hugs for
[1:22:28] a little while comes back and goes okay
[1:22:30] now I'll take a hug today it's a good
[1:22:35] moment there are times when he's willing
[1:22:38] to let dad put his arm around him there
[1:22:40] a lot of other times where he doesn't
[1:22:41] want me to touch
[1:22:44] him you have these different stages that
[1:22:47] that happen with the children in the
[1:22:50] natural but at the same time in the
[1:22:52] spiritual will go through some of these
[1:22:55] same back and
[1:22:56] forth and yes there's a progression we
[1:23:00] grow we develop and God is able to
[1:23:02] entrust us but there are times when
[1:23:04] we'll fall back and
[1:23:06] go Lord I
[1:23:09] just need full focus and attention right
[1:23:12] now Lord I just need some
[1:23:15] love I just need some sustenance I just
[1:23:19] need this that of the other
[1:23:26] when Christ is speaking and says suffer
[1:23:28] the little children come to
[1:23:31] me I don't think he put an age cap on
[1:23:34] this I don't think he was sitting there
[1:23:36] going all right if you're over 18 you're
[1:23:39] not in this
[1:23:43] list but it was the same thing where
[1:23:45] suffer little children it's very easy
[1:23:48] when we just think about it and imagine
[1:23:49] our mind it's all about oh let's have
[1:23:52] the cute little kids come up let's do
[1:23:54] this this do that and I'm not saying
[1:23:55] they shouldn't come they're still part
[1:23:57] of this
[1:24:00] absolutely but every one of us is a
[1:24:03] child of God every one of
[1:24:05] us has been called by him and he's
[1:24:08] calling us up to the point where we can
[1:24:10] reach that stage of
[1:24:13] adoption that's
[1:24:15] right my oldest Luke he's the closest I
[1:24:19] got he's not there yet he is not to the
[1:24:21] point where I'm gonna hand him my credit
[1:24:23] card and my checkbook and go I can trust
[1:24:26] you to make wise
[1:24:30] decisions
[1:24:33] now brother Austin over there is a lot
[1:24:37] closer to it I'd have to let sister key
[1:24:39] speak into how close he is you can
[1:24:42] discuss with her after church if you
[1:24:43] want to but he is closer to that
[1:24:46] point than Luke
[1:24:50] is and each one of us is at our
[1:24:53] different points in the journey
[1:24:55] each one of us is at our different
[1:24:57] points to have that full adoption to
[1:25:00] where we can have that full Authority
[1:25:03] yeah it doesn't change saying
[1:25:06] we're still a child we're still a child
[1:25:09] of God we're still a son or daughter of
[1:25:11] God the whole way through but the
[1:25:14] adoption is that final recognition to
[1:25:16] go he is thinking the same thoughts as
[1:25:19] me his decisions are the same type of
[1:25:22] decisions that I would make I can trust
[1:25:25] him to go
[1:25:26] out and what he does I'm not going to
[1:25:30] come behind and go oh he shouldn't have
[1:25:31] done
[1:25:32] that I'm not going to come back and
[1:25:34] rehire the guy that he
[1:25:36] fired I'm not going to go fire the guy
[1:25:39] that he just
[1:25:42] hired he's going to be making the same
[1:25:44] kind of
[1:25:46] decisions that I would have
[1:25:49] made and God calls us and instructs us
[1:25:52] and loves us and develops us and grows
[1:25:56] us you know when you go to the scripture
[1:25:58] there he talked about
[1:26:01] that in Psalms that children are
[1:26:07] arrows blessed is the man whose quiver
[1:26:09] is full and all
[1:26:11] this I know there are at least a few bow
[1:26:14] hunters in
[1:26:17] here I've never hunted with a bow I've
[1:26:21] shot traditional archery a decent amount
[1:26:24] never good enough that I thought I could
[1:26:25] actually take something but just go out
[1:26:27] and shoot at Targets has been
[1:26:28] great but it's interesting if you're
[1:26:31] looking at the traditional type archery
[1:26:34] which is going to be your long bow or
[1:26:35] recurve bow it's not going to be the
[1:26:37] compound bows that everybody knows right
[1:26:41] now the closer you draw it to
[1:26:44] yourself you are closer to the moment of
[1:26:47] releasing
[1:26:48] it so you
[1:26:51] keep as God's preparing to release his
[1:26:54] arrows we're drawing closer and closer
[1:26:56] to
[1:26:57] him as parents when we're raising our
[1:27:00] children before we release them into
[1:27:01] World we're drawing them closer and
[1:27:03] closer to us they're drawing closer and
[1:27:06] closer to our hearts drawing closer and
[1:27:08] closer to what we've been teaching them
[1:27:09] and raising them and the same thing is
[1:27:11] happening with God before he can release
[1:27:13] us we have to be drawn as close as
[1:27:18] possible and with traditional
[1:27:20] archery which is the kind of bow he
[1:27:22] would have been talking about in this
[1:27:25] the closer you draw it the harder it is
[1:27:27] to
[1:27:28] hold because you don't have these fancy
[1:27:30] gears that suddenly release and you okay
[1:27:32] I can hold this now because it just
[1:27:34] released the 20 pounds of weight or 30
[1:27:36] pounds of weight with traditional you're
[1:27:38] holding it the entire way so if you have
[1:27:41] a a bow that's supposed to be a draw 52
[1:27:43] PBS when you draw it back you hit 52 it
[1:27:46] sits at 52 there is no great it released
[1:27:49] and now you're down to 20 and it's easy
[1:27:50] to hold you are holding it at 52 lbs
[1:27:54] the entire time you have it
[1:27:57] drawn so it's very hard to hold in place
[1:28:00] when it's that
[1:28:02] close the closer you get to pulling it
[1:28:05] back the harder it is to hold and the
[1:28:07] more likely you are to release it
[1:28:11] sooner with the compound bow you can
[1:28:13] pull it back and you can stand there and
[1:28:15] hold it
[1:28:16] for Caleb how long could you hold your
[1:28:18] compound bow
[1:28:21] back long time because it releases is
[1:28:24] off a lot of the pressure for
[1:28:29] you when
[1:28:31] we
[1:28:36] drawback in the natural as parents it's
[1:28:39] harder to hold your children in cuz now
[1:28:42] they're ready to go into the world
[1:28:43] they're ready to get out and take on the
[1:28:46] world around
[1:28:48] them they're ready to get out there and
[1:28:50] get their job build a career find a
[1:28:53] spouse do do all these kind of things
[1:28:55] they are ready to leave the
[1:29:00] home the blessing
[1:29:02] is that in the
[1:29:05] spiritual our God is strong enough to
[1:29:07] hold us as long as it
[1:29:10] takes that may be getting harder and
[1:29:13] harder when it comes back but he's not
[1:29:16] straining he's not getting all red in
[1:29:18] the face because it's so hard to hold
[1:29:20] us but he knows you have to get up close
[1:29:23] enough to
[1:29:25] him before he's ready to release you
[1:29:27] that's
[1:29:30] right and the closer you can get to
[1:29:34] him the more powerful the launch
[1:29:37] is there's a thing in traditional
[1:29:39] archery called
[1:29:41] overdrawing you can overdraw your
[1:29:44] bow so it's designed if you have I'm
[1:29:48] going to use the 52 lb because that's
[1:29:49] the kind of recurve I have at 52 lbs if
[1:29:52] I'm at this many inches drawn it's at 52
[1:29:55] lb if I can
[1:29:57] overdraw and I have a cousin that does
[1:30:02] traditional archery that he will
[1:30:02] overdraw instead of drawing to just the
[1:30:05] tip of his mouth he will pull back to
[1:30:07] his ear by overdrawing he can add a few
[1:30:11] more
[1:30:12] pounds of
[1:30:14] force so that even though the bow maybe
[1:30:17] said says that it'll do 52 lbs he
[1:30:20] overdraws and now he has it set at 56
[1:30:23] lbs
[1:30:24] or 58 PBS or 60 PBS or whatever because
[1:30:28] he has gone beyond what the manufacturer
[1:30:30] rating at it
[1:30:35] was the further you draw back the closer
[1:30:38] you pull that towards the
[1:30:40] Archer the stronger the Flight of the
[1:30:43] air will be the more force that we'll
[1:30:49] have and the
[1:30:51] arrow is not of control of where it goes
[1:30:57] so when God is the great warrior that is
[1:31:00] the
[1:31:02] Archer he is fully aiming where we're
[1:31:05] going in life he is pointing us to it as
[1:31:10] he draws us closer to him and as we're
[1:31:11] becoming more and more like him and
[1:31:13] we're hitting that point of adoption to
[1:31:15] where we're thinking the same thoughts
[1:31:16] we're having the same
[1:31:19] actions he's the one who sets the target
[1:31:21] for us he's the one who aims where we're
[1:31:23] going
[1:31:24] the arrow doesn't make the decisions on
[1:31:26] its
[1:31:36] own we go through these different
[1:31:40] stages and I know these aren't all there
[1:31:43] in no way is these perfect types there's
[1:31:45] so many more things you could go into
[1:31:47] but I hope you're at least kind of
[1:31:48] getting where I was thinking and where I
[1:31:50] was coming from on it
[1:31:53] as Jesus is sitting there and he's going
[1:31:56] suffer the little children to
[1:31:58] come I don't think he's just talking
[1:32:01] about the babes and
[1:32:05] toddlers he's calling every single one
[1:32:08] of us and then as we go through our
[1:32:10] spiritual Walk we're going through these
[1:32:12] different stages we're going through
[1:32:13] these different parts of our
[1:32:16] relationship and then the best part
[1:32:18] about it to
[1:32:19] me is that we never lose what was in the
[1:32:23] last
[1:32:25] stage as long as I'm his child I never
[1:32:27] lose the need to be loved I never lose
[1:32:31] the need to be
[1:32:35] sustained I need God to feed me every
[1:32:37] day I need to be able to to feed off his
[1:32:39] word every day I don't outgrow it to
[1:32:42] where okay great I can go now Supply
[1:32:45] everything of
[1:32:46] myself those needs from the early stages
[1:32:50] are still there I still want his
[1:32:53] attention I still want to reach out
[1:32:55] sometimes and grab his face and make
[1:32:57] sure it's turned towards me so he's
[1:32:59] looking directly in my eyes and so I'm
[1:33:01] looking directly in his
[1:33:06] eyes I want to be at the point where I
[1:33:09] I've been through the
[1:33:10] tests and so I know that God can trust
[1:33:13] me with this responsibility and with
[1:33:15] this
[1:33:17] Authority we want to be at the point
[1:33:19] where we can be like job where God can
[1:33:22] go to Satan and go hey have you cons
[1:33:23] considered
[1:33:27] job at the same time we don't want to be
[1:33:29] like that if we look at it from the
[1:33:31] natural none of us want to go through
[1:33:33] what job went
[1:33:34] through but at the same time we want
[1:33:37] that much trust we want God to be able
[1:33:39] to look at us and go have you considered
[1:33:43] my children down in
[1:33:45] Oklahoma have you considered my children
[1:33:48] at New Life Outreach
[1:33:54] I know that they can
[1:33:55] handle the authority I know that they
[1:33:58] can handle this responsibility I know
[1:34:00] that they can
[1:34:01] handle these situations that you may
[1:34:04] throw at
[1:34:05] them because I've taught them I've
[1:34:07] raised them I've answered their
[1:34:09] questions I've supplied their
[1:34:12] needs I've pointed them in the right
[1:34:15] direction I've done everything that the
[1:34:18] good father should do
[1:34:24] and now we're getting to the point where
[1:34:26] I can look at them and go they're going
[1:34:29] to make the exact same decision I would
[1:34:31] make they're going to do the same thing
[1:34:34] that without me even telling them they
[1:34:37] know what I would want them to do they
[1:34:38] know my desires they know my
[1:34:41] will they have matured they have hit the
[1:34:44] point where now I can fully adopt them
[1:34:48] and bring them into the
[1:34:50] family cuz they are completely
[1:34:56] mine they're going to strike the Target
[1:34:58] that I want them to
[1:35:00] strike they're going to end up exactly
[1:35:02] where I want them
[1:35:04] to and they are going to take
[1:35:07] out the enemy that I want them to take
[1:35:21] out as the musicians come
[1:35:26] in the sermon how can I
[1:35:32] overcome How will I know then brother
[1:35:34] brandom that I'm in there watch what
[1:35:37] kind of life you're living just look
[1:35:39] around see if it's just lived out of you
[1:35:41] automatically or do you have to strain
[1:35:44] and pull see then you're doing it but
[1:35:47] don't try to do it did you ever try yeah
[1:35:49] don't just like putting a little baby's
[1:35:51] arm in a sleeve hole you see he just up
[1:35:54] down over everything else see he can't
[1:35:57] do it put on your coat honey he can't do
[1:36:00] it little arm is up down around it takes
[1:36:01] your Steady
[1:36:03] Hand oh how glad I am I can just yield
[1:36:06] my hand to my father say Lord Jesus I
[1:36:08] can't get in there you help me put the
[1:36:11] coat on I quit trying just let him do it
[1:36:14] see if the little baby keeps trying oh I
[1:36:18] can do it I can do it he's just
[1:36:20] everywhere he can't do it neither can
[1:36:22] you neither can I but if we'll just hold
[1:36:24] still and let him do it just yield to
[1:36:27] him here Lord here I am just let me be
[1:36:30] nothing I yield you put my hand in the
[1:36:32] right place that's the victory that's
[1:36:35] overcoming the thing you have to
[1:36:37] overcome is yourself your idea your
[1:36:40] thing and surrender yourself to him he
[1:36:43] overcame for you he knows the way we
[1:36:51] don't each one of us is at different
[1:36:54] stages in our spiritual journey each one
[1:36:56] of us is at different
[1:36:58] point maybe some are still in the
[1:37:01] newborn baby stage maybe some are still
[1:37:03] in the toddler stage maybe there are a
[1:37:06] few that are in that teenage stage that
[1:37:07] they're so close to adoption that they
[1:37:10] are getting more and more responsibility
[1:37:13] they are showing themselves more and
[1:37:14] more
[1:37:16] capable and I'm sure
[1:37:21] they're we're moving towards
[1:37:24] that state of complete adoption to where
[1:37:27] we are thinking the same thoughts we are
[1:37:30] doing the same
[1:37:32] things we are doing and living out the
[1:37:36] will that God has for
[1:37:41] us every one of us is God's child every
[1:37:45] one of
[1:37:46] us can fall into the suffer the little
[1:37:49] children to
[1:37:50] [Music]
[1:37:52] come God created
[1:37:55] us he loves his
[1:37:57] creation he made each one of us special
[1:38:00] he made each one of us individual he
[1:38:02] made each one of us with a
[1:38:05] purpose from the
[1:38:08] youngest to the oldest each one of us
[1:38:11] has a reason for
[1:38:13] being each one of us has things that God
[1:38:16] intends for us to
[1:38:19] accomplish they may not be anything that
[1:38:21] would ever be written down in a book
[1:38:23] anywhere
[1:38:24] they may not be anything that would get
[1:38:25] our Nam in's
[1:38:28] lights but he doesn't
[1:38:30] create
[1:38:32] waste he doesn't have children that
[1:38:35] they're just kind of extra off to the
[1:38:38] side who knows
[1:38:40] whatever every one of
[1:38:42] us God has a purpose every one of us God
[1:38:47] has the things that and brother brandom
[1:38:50] said time and time again until your
[1:38:52] purpose is fulfilled
[1:38:54] Satan can't take
[1:38:56] you if you still have something that you
[1:38:58] are supposed to
[1:39:02] do Satan can't touch your life he may
[1:39:05] give you sickness he may do all kinds of
[1:39:07] things but if God still intends for you
[1:39:10] to accomplish something if there's still
[1:39:13] another person you're supposed to talk
[1:39:14] to is there still another prayer you're
[1:39:16] supposed to utter if there's still
[1:39:19] another kind word you're supposed to
[1:39:21] speak
[1:39:26] then you're still
[1:39:28] here God doesn't release the arrow until
[1:39:32] it's time for it to
[1:39:33] fly he never releases early he never
[1:39:37] slips his finger doesn't just slip off
[1:39:40] the
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:44] string each one of us is here with a
[1:39:47] purpose and whatever stage in the
[1:39:49] journey we may
[1:39:51] be the center of that journey is
[1:39:55] Christ the center of that journey is our
[1:39:58] Lord is our father that is instructing
[1:40:01] us that isn't teaching
[1:40:03] us there is nothing shameful about being
[1:40:06] at the newborn baby stage there is
[1:40:07] nothing shameful about being at the
[1:40:09] toddler
[1:40:10] stage it's just the stage of the journey
[1:40:12] that you're
[1:40:13] in but God is calling each one of us he
[1:40:17] is instructing each one of us he is
[1:40:20] teaching us and showing us the way
[1:40:24] for every single one of his
[1:40:28] children from the youth to the
[1:40:31] elders every single one of
[1:40:34] us he is continuing to instruct he is in
[1:40:37] continuing to minister
[1:40:46] to I think that should give us
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:55] a really good
[1:40:57] feeling to know that God has us whatever
[1:41:00] stage we're
[1:41:02] in whatever step we're not comparing
[1:41:06] ourselves to each other we're not like
[1:41:09] at least we shouldn't be like the
[1:41:10] natural kids where my little girl
[1:41:13] charity will all the time go how come
[1:41:16] Luke gets to do this why does Luke get
[1:41:18] to do that well cuz he's 15 and you're
[1:41:22] nine
[1:41:24] there's a difference here there's a
[1:41:26] difference in what can be
[1:41:30] done God isn't comparing
[1:41:33] you to the person sitting beside
[1:41:36] you he isn't comparing you to the person
[1:41:40] on the other side of the
[1:41:42] church he is looking at you and
[1:41:44] going this is where you're supposed to
[1:41:46] be in the stage of the
[1:41:48] journey I've taught you up to this point
[1:41:52] you've got the this much further to
[1:41:55] go maybe it's a short period maybe it's
[1:41:59] a long
[1:42:00] period but God has you where he is and
[1:42:02] he's going to slowly keep drawing you
[1:42:05] back to himself he's going to slowly
[1:42:07] keep pulling you closer and
[1:42:09] closer to his
[1:42:16] heart we can feel safe in that we can
[1:42:19] feel stable in that
[1:42:23] even the times we mess
[1:42:28] up there have been
[1:42:30] times especially since Luke has started
[1:42:33] working when I have talked to him after
[1:42:36] a shift at Chick-fil-A and he is all
[1:42:38] frustrated because he messed up
[1:42:40] somewhere and he made a
[1:42:43] mistake and he'll tell me about it and
[1:42:46] most of the time I'm like if that's the
[1:42:47] worst you did you did pretty good today
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:53] but I can go to him and I can tell him
[1:42:55] hey you're doing well hey these are the
[1:42:59] things that you're doing correctly maybe
[1:43:02] you messed up there so let's do better
[1:43:04] next
[1:43:05] time I can encourage him I can correct
[1:43:08] him I can help him to grow I can help
[1:43:09] him to
[1:43:11] develop and God's doing the same thing
[1:43:13] with every single one of
[1:43:15] us we mess up and sometimes he still has
[1:43:19] to spank
[1:43:21] Us and other times he picks us up out of
[1:43:24] the dirt he brushes us off and he goes
[1:43:26] try
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:30] again he will do what we need in the
[1:43:36] journey he is not a forgetful father he
[1:43:38] is not a father that's going to cast us
[1:43:41] to the side he is with us every step of
[1:43:44] the
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:43:47] way and even when we mess up so bad in
[1:43:51] our head we're going how in the
[1:43:54] world could I ever recover from
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:43:59] this God's still sitting there
[1:44:01] going I knew that was
[1:44:04] coming now let me show
[1:44:07] you how we're going to keep moving
[1:44:10] forward let me show you what you need to
[1:44:12] learn from this let me give you the
[1:44:14] correction you need let me give you the
[1:44:17] love that you
[1:44:18] [Music]
[1:44:21] need God corrects us and then he will
[1:44:25] also bring us right back into his arms
[1:44:27] of love to let us know that he still
[1:44:29] cares about us no matter how bad we may
[1:44:32] have
[1:44:34] done he is still the loving father he is
[1:44:39] still the corrective
[1:44:41] father but he is still the father that
[1:44:47] will run to the
[1:44:49] Sun that went off and finally came
[1:44:56] back he is still the father that will
[1:44:58] run to us he is still the father that
[1:45:00] will Embrace us he is still the father
[1:45:02] that will teach us that will love
[1:45:05] us every step of the
[1:45:11] way Lord

[1:45:27] and Lord I pray that this would just
[1:45:31] be an encouragement to everyone

[1:45:45] it in control and that that he is still
[1:45:48] the ultimate father he is still the one
[1:45:50] that can teach us everything he is still
[1:45:53] still the one that can show us
[1:45:53] everything he is still the one that can
[1:45:56] handle every situation that comes

[1:46:12] quote I read Lord that the way we
