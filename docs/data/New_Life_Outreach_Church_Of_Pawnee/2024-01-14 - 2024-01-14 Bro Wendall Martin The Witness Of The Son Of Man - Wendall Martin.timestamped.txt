[44:42] let's look here at at Revelations 10 and
[44:45] and
[44:46] one and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[44:50] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[44:52] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[44:55] feet were as it were the Sun or or his
[44:58] his face as it were the sun his feet as
[45:00] the pillars of fire he had in his hand a
[45:03] little book and he set his right foot
[45:06] upon the sea and his left foot on the
[45:08] earth and cried with a loud voice as
[45:11] when a lion roars and when he had cried
[45:15] seven Thunders uttered their voices and
[45:18] when the seven Thunders had uttered
[45:19] their voices I was about to write and I
[45:22] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[45:25] seal up those things which the seven
[45:27] Thunders uttered and write them not and
[45:31] the angel which I saw stand upon the on
[45:33] the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[45:35] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[45:38] liveth forever and ever who created
[45:41] heaven and the things therein are and
[45:44] the earth and the things that therein
[45:46] are and the Sea and the things that uh
[45:49] are therein that there should be no more
[45:53] time and in the days of the voice of the
[45:55] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[45:57] sound the mystery of God should be
[46:00] finished as he has declared to his
[46:02] servants the
[46:04] prophets and the voice which I heard
[46:06] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[46:09] go and take the little book which is
[46:11] open in the hand of the Angel and that
[46:14] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[46:17] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[46:19] unto him give me the little book and he
[46:23] said unto me take it and E it up and it
[46:27] shall be uh it shall make thy better
[46:30] belly bitter and it shall be to thy
[46:33] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[46:36] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[46:38] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[46:40] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[46:42] my belly was bitter and he said thou
[46:45] must prophesy again before many peoples
[46:48] and Nations
[46:49] tongues and
[46:52] Kings amen Psalms 119 and 10 you don't

[49:00] year of
[49:02] Miracles and and I'm looking forward to
[49:05] what God's going to do how many believes
[49:06] God still heals
[49:08] Parkinson's amen I I truly believe that
[49:12] I just got to I want to speak on faith
[49:15] here this morning and um uh you know
[49:19] faith has got to have a
[49:21] foundation and we have been uh we we've
[49:24] dealt a little bit with the witness or
[49:27] or with the son of man and how amen that
[49:30] we are uh that the promise was right
[49:35] before the coming of the Lord that the
[49:38] son the the son of man would be revealed
[49:42] in the time of in the evening time when
[49:46] the um when when the Sodom condition uh
[49:51] would would um be the prevailing Spirit
[49:54] In the Land
[49:56] amen and and and we know that uh as as
[50:00] Sodom was being prepared to burn the son
[50:03] of man was there preparing the hearts of
[50:07] Abraham and Sarah for the promise that
[50:10] they had been waiting on Amen and so it
[50:14] took the witness of the son of man
[50:17] witnessing to the words of promise that
[50:20] had already been spoke to to Abraham and
[50:24] Sarah that they had been waiting on for
[50:27] 25 years waiting for this promise to
[50:31] come and so they had been Faithfully
[50:34] waiting upon the word they had stood uh
[50:37] against the the elements of time they
[50:41] had been uh waiting for 24 years when
[50:45] the son of man appeared and and and in
[50:48] the form of a of a man Prophet God had
[50:52] come and ministered to their hearts amen
[50:56] and told them that they truly would have
[51:00] that that child and so I want to speak
[51:04] this morning because I believe the son
[51:06] of man is here on the earth now brother
[51:09] brandham was a son of man amen he was
[51:12] the revelations 10:7 but the son of man
[51:15] is Revelations 10:1 that that has come
[51:19] with a mighty book and and that book has
[51:22] been open and God has declared who you
[51:26] are the Seals have been taken off of the
[51:29] book so that you can understand that
[51:32] you're not just a church system but that
[51:35] you are the very bride of Jesus Christ
[51:39] amen I I I say if you're looking for the
[51:41] bride of Christ and if you're looking
[51:43] for God look no further just look to
[51:46] your neighbor amen and you'll see God
[51:49] because you are the manifestation of the
[51:53] promises of God in this day that we're
[51:55] we're living in amen so the the rock of
[51:59] God's word should forever more be our
[52:03] tpost the word of God must be amen our
[52:09] our only foundation our desire should
[52:12] always be Lord never let me Drift from
[52:17] your word if your word has spoken and
[52:21] your word has been brought To Us by
[52:23] Malachi 4 in this day to day God give me
[52:27] a heart to never allow that word to to
[52:32] wonder from my heart can you say amen
[52:36] amen I want to say here this morning
[52:38] that his word is the only thing that is
[52:41] secure amen it is secure it is his word
[52:45] that he said heavens and earth will pass
[52:47] away but my word will endure forever
[52:51] it'll stand the test of time well praise
[52:54] the Lord I I I want to say what you have
[52:57] embraced in your heart this revelation
[53:00] of the word of God in your heart is
[53:02] something that'll take you right on into
[53:04] the
[53:05] Rapture it'll take you into the Rapture
[53:08] now he didn't say there wasn't going to
[53:09] be hard times he didn't say there
[53:11] wouldn't going to be amen times of
[53:13] discouragement and Times of
[53:15] disappointments and Times of sickness
[53:17] and Times of wondering but he did say
[53:20] I've given you my promise and that
[53:23] promise I will keep to you amen well
[53:26] praise the lord it's greater than
[53:29] anything past it is greater than
[53:31] anything current it is greater than
[53:33] anything in the future the word of God
[53:35] is the greatest thing well praise the
[53:38] Lord amen I say the word of God it it it
[53:41] supersedes it surpasses any Revelation
[53:45] that you may have amen the word of God
[53:48] should should supersede any idea amen
[53:52] any kind of a thought that is contrary
[53:54] to the word of God the word of God
[53:58] should supersede it all the word should
[54:01] be our absolute how many believes that
[54:04] here this morning the word must be
[54:07] forever more our absolute hallelujah
[54:10] it's the anchor amen there is no
[54:13] Revelation secure unless it comes from
[54:16] scripture amen now I know there's some
[54:19] people that think they've got a greater
[54:20] Revelation than brother Bram or they've
[54:22] got a higher Revelation amen but I want
[54:25] tell you you'll never come any greater
[54:27] Revelation than what has been brought to
[54:29] us in our generation God sent us Malachi
[54:32] 4 to turn our hearts back to this and
[54:35] this is what we stand upon Amen brother
[54:38] brenon would say in the church age book
[54:40] he would say the word of God is forever
[54:42] settled in heaven and before one Speck
[54:45] of Stardust was made God's word God's
[54:49] law was there exactly as it is written
[54:53] in our Bible well that should make you
[54:55] want to shout hallelujah amen another
[54:57] place he says faith takes its position
[55:01] on the rock of God's word and all the
[55:04] waves of Hell beating against its
[55:08] foundation it'll take its Eagle Eye and
[55:11] soar Beyond them clouds and see the god
[55:14] of the resurrection and of Promise amen
[55:18] I it it doesn't matter Faith takes that
[55:22] stand Faith rests upon the Rock of God's
[55:26] word and there is nothing that hell can
[55:30] do to destroy or to take back what God
[55:33] has already said can you say Amen so I
[55:36] want to get that established this
[55:38] morning the word of God must be the
[55:42] foundation for faith if you want Faith
[55:46] you've got to have something for Faith
[55:49] to rest upon you can't rest it upon
[55:51] feelings you can't rest it upon gifts
[55:54] you can't rest it upon upon emotions
[55:56] you've got to rest it upon the word
[55:58] that's why God sent us a prophet in this
[56:00] day he sent a prophet because it was
[56:03] going to take a rapturing faith and that
[56:06] rapturing faith has got to have a word
[56:08] that would be unmovable for your faith
[56:12] to stand
[56:13] upon hallelujah amen let the waves of
[56:16] Hell come amen pouring over your souls
[56:20] when the gates of hell are bombarding
[56:22] you you can stand there upon that f
[56:24] Foundation because God's word cannot
[56:29] fail God's word well praise the lord
[56:33] well you say well I I've been battling
[56:35] my sickness I've been battling in my
[56:36] mind God's word cannot
[56:41] fail if Satan can take your faith and
[56:44] get you away from what God's word is
[56:46] saying then then he's got you with he's
[56:49] got you be but if you will take your
[56:52] faith and you will base it upon the word
[56:55] of God instead of what you're feeling it
[56:58] will bring you out of your current
[57:02] situation amen hallelujah that
[57:05] Foundation remains solid and true no
[57:09] matter what praise the Lord amen so the
[57:12] word of God thinking here this morning
[57:15] amen is as as I I begin to think about
[57:18] this this incredible witness of this
[57:20] last day and how that when God sent this
[57:24] prophet
[57:25] he he didn't really point us to his gift
[57:28] he didn't point us to uh uh uh the nine
[57:32] spiritual gifts so much he didn't point
[57:35] us to
[57:36] organization and and you know we we we
[57:39] appreciate all the nine spiritual gifts
[57:42] and we appreciate all of these things
[57:44] that God gave us amen and and that's all
[57:47] part of it but there's one thing that
[57:49] brother brandham wanted to to Really
[57:52] drive home is stay with the word I think
[57:58] any Pastor would want to do the same
[58:00] thing stay with that word amen amen
[58:05] there's going to be many interpretations
[58:07] but you stay with the word because
[58:09] interpretations will die with the man
[58:11] but God's word cannot
[58:14] fail amen praise the Lord so the word of
[58:18] God it's endured amen I all the world's
[58:22] uh philosophy it has endured Kings and
[58:25] kingdoms it it has endured thousands of
[58:29] denominations and yet the word is still
[58:32] the same it has not changed with culture
[58:34] it has not changed with time there has
[58:37] been kingdoms come kingdoms fall there's
[58:39] been King cultures rise cultures fall
[58:43] but the word Still Remains the Same amen
[58:47] for thousands and thousands of years and
[58:50] when you base your faith upon that word
[58:54] you you can remain the same you can
[58:57] stand in the battle you can stand when
[59:01] the enemy is fighting against you Amen
[59:04] brother Brandon would say he says all of
[59:07] the waves of hell are beating against
[59:10] its foundation but it'll take its Eagle
[59:13] Eye and soar Beyond them clouds and will
[59:17] see the god of the resurrection and
[59:20] promise can you say amen amen the
[59:23] revelation of the word of God will take
[59:27] you out amen it brought Israel out of
[59:30] Egypt why because a prophet of God came
[59:33] into that land and begin to tell them
[59:36] God has heard your cry and God has said
[59:41] you've got a land I know you've been in
[59:43] bondage for 400 years I know you are
[59:46] slaves I know amen that you know nothing
[59:50] about freedom but the prophet came and
[59:53] the prophet had the sayith the Lord and
[59:55] the prophet says God sees you beyond
[59:59] slavery he sees you beyond your
[1:00:02] circumstance he's going to take you to
[1:00:04] the promise can you say Amen you have to
[1:00:08] see the Promise you've got to put your
[1:00:11] faith not in your situation you've got
[1:00:14] to put your faith in the word of
[1:00:19] God hallelujah can you say Amen Israel
[1:00:23] might look at him and say you don't
[1:00:25] understand we are under the bondage of
[1:00:28] sin we're under the bondage of pharaoh
[1:00:31] but he came with a word that was
[1:00:36] absolute and full of
[1:00:39] power well praise the
[1:00:41] Lord
[1:00:43] faith faith put you takes you out of the
[1:00:47] Well's
[1:00:48] belly and places you on the foundation
[1:00:53] of the word
[1:00:55] Faith takes you out of the Lion's Den
[1:00:59] now you're still in the Lion's Den but
[1:01:01] your faith is perched upon the realities
[1:01:06] of an unfailing word well praise the
[1:01:09] Lord does that just make you feel good
[1:01:12] faith takes you beyond where you are and
[1:01:17] places you in a
[1:01:19] Rapture
[1:01:22] hallelujah what can you say Amen
[1:01:25] amen you know why Satan hates
[1:01:27] Revelation amen because Revelation takes
[1:01:31] you out of your dungeon that he's got
[1:01:34] you in and places you and you can see
[1:01:37] the way God sees you do you realize that
[1:01:40] God sees you perfect do you realize that
[1:01:42] God sees you in a Rapture do you realize
[1:01:46] that God's already got your name in the
[1:01:48] Lamb's Book of Life do you realize
[1:01:51] you've already got a seat there at that
[1:01:54] marriage table of the Lamb I'm telling
[1:01:57] you you're already
[1:02:00] there
[1:02:02] amen Satan don't want you to believe
[1:02:05] it amen he tries to take the word away
[1:02:08] from you if he can keep the word away
[1:02:10] from you he's going to keep you living
[1:02:13] in darkness right if he can take that
[1:02:15] word away from you you're living in
[1:02:17] discouragement if he can take that word
[1:02:19] away from you amen you're you're
[1:02:21] defeated you're condemned you're dis
[1:02:24] courage but if you can ever rise on the

[1:13:12] years amen past menopause she she is
[1:13:16] amen her her body is is is is dying by

[1:13:29] the longer that it took right that
[1:13:32] wasn't Blind Faith brother that was a
[1:13:34] vision that was a vision faith become a
[1:13:37] v you don't have to be a prophet to have

[1:13:41] to lay hands on you and prophesy over
[1:13:44] you to have a vision Faith your faith
[1:13:47] when it gets out of this realm into that
[1:13:50] realm then you can see the way God sees
[1:13:55] [Music]

[1:14:01] Lorden you know what brother brandham
[1:14:02] says he says it's a place just you and
[1:14:06] God alone I want you to think about that
[1:14:10] have you ever been in the presence of
[1:14:13] God and then you run into somebody
[1:14:15] that's not been in the presence of
[1:14:18] God and your faith is
[1:14:21] just and you never want to leave that
[1:14:23] presence and that's right then you go
[1:14:26] talk to another man that's not been in
[1:14:28] the presence of God
[1:14:31] and he's got negative stuff and that's
[1:14:35] right he's full of doubts and he's
[1:14:38] talking about the situation and before

[1:15:34] all he could see was a bunch of
[1:15:36] miserable Israelites that were now
[1:15:38] slaves to him Hallelujah but brother
[1:15:41] bradam says when Moses looked out the
[1:15:42] same window he looked out the same
[1:15:44] window looking at the same people and he
[1:15:46] saw a promise he saw Covenant people he
[1:15:51] saw a nation he he saw a mighty
[1:15:57] nation a mighty nation while still

[1:17:06] thing it is going to take you to your
[1:17:08] Victory why because you're walking in a
[1:17:11] world all

[1:19:04] the midst of the Parkinson's in the
[1:19:05] midst of the sickness it doesn't matter
[1:19:08] what RSV says what it says is God is my
[1:19:16] answer God's our
[1:19:18] answer God brings us out this is not the
[1:19:22] figment of man's imagination and the
[1:19:25] realities of this message is to bring
[1:19:28] Jesus Christ to
[1:19:33] Earth can you say
[1:19:35] Amen we walk with
[1:19:38] God in that unique
[1:19:40] realm as brother Aaron and Sister

[1:20:10] seen But at the things which are not
[1:20:13] seen for the things which are
[1:20:16] seen are temporal somebody say temporal
[1:20:19] temporal but the
[1:20:21] things which are not

[1:21:03] Apostle Paul would say Amen now listen
[1:21:06] he he would say you you you've got to
[1:21:09] put on the mind of Christ this Vision
[1:21:12] that God is painting is is a vision that
[1:21:16] can only come by the word of God because
[1:21:19] faith can only come from the word so
[1:21:22] you've got to look at this word except
[1:21:25] this is your absolute and ask God to
[1:21:27] give you a vision of it give you a
[1:21:30] revelation and where you can stand put
[1:21:35] yourself in Abraham's condition put
[1:21:37] yourself Amen in the widow woman's

[1:22:19] verse says but they have not all obeyed
[1:22:21] the gospel
[1:22:23] for Isaiah said Lord who
[1:22:25] have
[1:22:27] believed they've
[1:22:29] heard yes but they didn't
[1:22:32] believe but Isaiah was saying who has

[1:27:07] turned around and there wasn't no one
[1:27:09] there right brother BR thought H now
[1:27:14] brother bradam was fixing to miss the
[1:27:15] vision too and he'd been going around
[1:27:17] telling everybody it's going to happen
[1:27:19] and now brother bram's walking away from
[1:27:20] the vision brother bram's walking
[1:27:22] getting in the car cuz his stomach was
[1:27:23] sick he he's missing his children at
[1:27:25] home about the same age of as as as U I
[1:27:29] believe she I think he said Rebecca one
[1:27:31] of the girls and and so uh that and then
[1:27:36] something said to go
[1:27:38] back and showed him the hill showed him
[1:27:41] the Rocks showed him the condition and
[1:27:44] then he he sat there thinking and he
[1:27:46] says now brother I I believe it was I
[1:27:49] believe it was Brother Moore I believe
[1:27:51] he said brother brother Moore is there
[1:27:54] is there something about this in one of
[1:27:57] the
[1:27:58] visions and then it came to
[1:28:01] him then he walks over there and he
[1:28:05] looks at this child he looks at the car
[1:28:07] he looks at everything then he
[1:28:10] says if this boy isn't standing up here
[1:28:13] in the next few minutes run me out cuz
[1:28:17] I'm a false prophet oh what is it he's
[1:28:21] seen him himself in the vision before it
[1:28:25] made him sick before he he was he was
[1:28:27] ready to get out of there but now he's
[1:28:29] standing there why because he can base
[1:28:33] his faith upon thus saith the
[1:28:38] Lord and then so God raised him up God
[1:28:42] God raised that boy up
[1:28:46] well now the vision didn't show anything
[1:28:49] about the other boy there was a second
[1:28:51] boy
[1:28:52] right that was that that was fighting
[1:28:55] for its breath and
[1:28:57] dying well the parents are now calling
[1:29:00] to brother brandham and
[1:29:03] saying you you uh you you raised this
[1:29:06] one up come and pray and they said
[1:29:09] listen he said I I I've done this by
[1:29:10] Vision I I I I can pray but I and and
[1:29:14] and and they just kept going but he but
[1:29:15] he didn't have a word of the Lord y'all
[1:29:17] remember that y'all remember the story
[1:29:19] and then and then and and and they kept
[1:29:21] asking and calling asking and calling
[1:29:22] and asking and calling and and brother
[1:29:24] brandom couldn't give him anything
[1:29:25] because he didn't have he didn't have a
[1:29:27] vision didn't have thus sayith the Lord
[1:29:29] and then and then he had the vision
[1:29:31] remember him the two the two candies and
[1:29:34] and he and he ate the one and it was
[1:29:36] sweet and he ate the other and he spit
[1:29:37] it back out and and and and and it was
[1:29:40] so bitter and then the angel of the Lord
[1:29:41] says if you don't eat that candy that
[1:29:43] boy won't live and and or that and and
[1:29:46] remember the plants the two plants there
[1:29:48] his Visions were a lot by by symbology
[1:29:52] and and so when he ate the one it went
[1:29:55] up and then this other one you know when
[1:29:58] when he spit it it was going up then he
[1:29:59] spit it back out and it wilted back
[1:30:01] again and and and so it says it won't it
[1:30:04] won't live unless you eat that candy so
[1:30:07] it eats the candy and then it's and then
[1:30:09] it lives and then the angel of the Lord
[1:30:11] tells him that boy will live and and and
[1:30:15] and then he's got all of Heaven backing
[1:30:18] him up and he goes and the boy lifts
[1:30:22] y'all remember the story if you haven't
[1:30:23] if you haven't heard it no go back it's
[1:30:26] it's incredible because he was relying
[1:30:28] now but there was and and and and we
[1:30:31] could say that on on on on the brother
[1:30:33] Bram says that he said when he went to
[1:30:34] India and he had those 17 different uh
[1:30:37] the the different religions behind him
[1:30:39] and and and he said I would have never I
[1:30:43] would have never done what I'd done on
[1:30:44] this
[1:30:45] platform and and and challenge those
[1:30:48] guys when they when I had Billy to go
[1:30:50] out and and and find find somebody and
[1:30:52] when when the when the man came up the
[1:30:54] man was totally he didn't have his eyes
[1:30:56] he had been he had been worshiping the
[1:30:57] Sun and his eyes were totally gone it
[1:31:00] was it was it was gone and so as he's
[1:31:02] walking and then turns around and he
[1:31:03] says I would have never told these guys
[1:31:05] if any of your Gods can do this go come
[1:31:07] over here and do it he said but I
[1:31:09] already seen it in a
[1:31:12] vision and my faith was in that Vision I
[1:31:17] knew it was going to happen because I
[1:31:19] seen
[1:31:20] it Hallelujah
[1:31:23] amen now I want you to really think have
[1:31:24] you ever thought about that Billy Paul
[1:31:26] went to go get the boy brother brandom
[1:31:28] had already had the vision Billy God
[1:31:31] directed Billy Paul to go get the
[1:31:34] guy didn't I he says go pick the worst
[1:31:37] case you can find didn't tell him blind
[1:31:39] lame didn't tell him anything he brings
[1:31:41] him up it's the same guy that brother
[1:31:42] random had already seen in the
[1:31:46] vision God is in control it's God's word
[1:31:51] if we can put our faith in God's word we
[1:31:58] hallelujah amen the Lord healed him can
[1:32:02] you say Amen another place brother
[1:32:04] Brandon would say he would say now about
[1:32:07] the man that had support him there I
[1:32:09] believe it was in
[1:32:11] Kansas um I I believe it was in in
[1:32:14] Kansas City and he stuck his neck out on
[1:32:16] the line and and and it and it uh uh uh
[1:32:19] uh supported brother pranam and was a
[1:32:22] great financial help to brother brandham
[1:32:24] and now brother brandham or or now the
[1:32:27] call just came in and said that a wall
[1:32:29] he he was a a wall just fell on top of
[1:32:32] him thousands and thousands of pounds
[1:32:34] and he's crushed underne and it's just
[1:32:37] he he just he is so mashed and crushed
[1:32:40] and and and the word came and brother
[1:32:43] Brandon was saying oh he's such a good
[1:32:44] man he's there there talking to meet him
[1:32:46] he says he's such a good man he's he's
[1:32:49] he's supported he's so he says I if I
[1:32:52] could just see a vision of him I it
[1:32:56] would be I I would go and and praise say
[1:33:00] if Jesus was here he would take his holy
[1:33:03] hands and he would go down because he's
[1:33:06] holy and he's and he's just and he's
[1:33:08] pure and and he would lay his righteous
[1:33:11] hands and I know the boy the man would
[1:33:13] live he said but I can't see a vision in
[1:33:15] my hands I I can't go pray for
[1:33:19] him and then the revelation
[1:33:22] truck Lord it said but you are the
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:27] redeemed his blood was shed so that your
[1:33:31] hands can be
[1:33:32] holy so that your voice can be pure so
[1:33:37] that your prayer can be prayed in faith
[1:33:39] praise the Lord and he's looking there
[1:33:41] and he's he's thinking about this and he
[1:33:44] he says that's right the lamb has been
[1:33:48] shed so that I can pray and he
[1:33:52] goes and he lays his hands on him with a
[1:33:56] genuine faith believing that God still
[1:33:59] hears prayer and that God would heal and
[1:34:02] God raised the boy the man up from the
[1:34:05] grave it was something greater than a
[1:34:10] normal vision because God done these
[1:34:13] things to show you you don't have to be
[1:34:16] a prophet in order to see things the way
[1:34:19] God sees things amen
[1:34:22] it took a prophet to show us that faith
[1:34:26] in that word will bring God on the seat
[1:34:31] amen hallelujah oh can you say amen amen
[1:34:36] yes yes you see Thy word amen Thy word
[1:34:42] is a lamp you see God lifted would would
[1:34:46] would lift brother brandom up amen and
[1:34:49] he could see past the Circumstance the
[1:34:52] present condition and the prophet
[1:34:55] message has come this son of man message
[1:34:59] has come to lift us out of these
[1:35:03] perversions to declare that God is here
[1:35:08] right
[1:35:09] now the mighty Angel is on the earth it
[1:35:13] didn't go back to heaven when mother
[1:35:14] Bram died the mighty Angel is
[1:35:19] here that's right and what did the eth
[1:35:22] verse just tell us it didn't say for us
[1:35:25] to go to brother brandham because
[1:35:27] brother brandham would already be off
[1:35:28] the scene the book is now open and now
[1:35:31] he's saying go to the
[1:35:34] angel take the book eat the book get
[1:35:38] Faith from the book then you can start
[1:35:41] prophesying you can start saying the
[1:35:43] same things that the book says you can
[1:35:45] believe the same thing read the open
[1:35:48] book it was closed no one understood it
[1:35:50] no one could well Isaiah said the same
[1:35:53] thing he says he says it the people has
[1:35:56] become amen one that like one that is
[1:35:59] blind that does not know how to read or
[1:36:02] that the book is sealed and no one knows
[1:36:04] how to open it Hallelujah but here in
