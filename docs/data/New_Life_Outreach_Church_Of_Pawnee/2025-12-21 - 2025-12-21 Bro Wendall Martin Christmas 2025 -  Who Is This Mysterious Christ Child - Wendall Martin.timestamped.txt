[34:07] [music] once again?
[34:09] We go to G.
[34:13] And they brought young children to him
[34:15] that he should touch them. And his
[34:18] disciples rebuked those that brought
[34:20] [music] them. But when Jesus saw it, he
[34:24] was much to please much displeased and
[34:27] said unto them, "Suffer the little
[34:29] children to come unto me, and forbid
[34:32] them not, for as such is the kingdom of
[34:35] God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever
[34:39] shall not receive the kingdom of God as
[34:41] a little child, he shall not enter
[34:44] therein.
[34:46] And he took them up in his arms,
[34:49] put his [music] hands on them, and
[34:52] blessed them. How many wants to [music]
[34:55] be blessed this morning? How many wants
[34:57] to touch Jesus? How many believes he can

[43:58] &gt;&gt; And we're sure thankful for that. If you

[44:34] her and and I think Sister Khalila uh
[44:38] wrote the play and then uh Sister Uh
[44:41] Katrina has has been here with getting
[44:44] everything. She's she's the general.
[44:46] Amen. Uh you you walk in here when

[44:56] [laughter]
[44:58] and so uh it's [clears throat] it's
[45:01] going to be uh now I and I was only here
[45:04] for the other day. So there if all of
[45:06] you who have been working in this, I
[45:08] know um I have been working with those
[45:10] three sisters. And so um everyone else
[45:14] who has had a part into this, we we say
[45:16] God bless you. I think brother brother
[45:19] Dylan and and brother Austin built some
[45:21] props and and uh uh so we say God bless
[45:25] them. But it's going to be a wonderful a
[45:28] wonderful day today and um I I trust
[45:32] that everyone can stay for uh for the
[45:35] entire day. Let's let's look here in
[45:37] Matthew 1 and8.
[45:40] [clears throat]
[45:41] It says now the birth of Jesus Christ
[45:44] was on this wise
[45:47] when as his mother Mary was espoused to
[45:51] Joseph
[45:52] before they came together
[45:55] she was found with child
[46:00] of God the father.
[46:03] Amen. Let's let's maybe I've got
[46:05] something in my glasses here. She was
[46:08] found with child
[46:11] of the Holy Ghost.
[46:14] And when Joseph, her husband, being a
[46:16] just man, and not willing to make a
[46:19] public example, was minded to put her
[46:22] away privately.
[46:25] And but while he thought on these
[46:27] things, behold, the angel of the Lord
[46:29] appeared unto him in a dream, saying,
[46:31] Joseph,
[46:33] thou son of David, fear not to take unto
[46:36] thee Mary thy wife. For that which is
[46:40] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost,
[46:44] and she shall bring forth a son, and
[46:48] thou shalt call his name Jesus,
[46:51] for he shall save his people from their
[46:54] sins.
[46:55] And now all of this was done that it
[46:59] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[47:02] the Lord of the Lord by the prophet
[47:04] saying, "Behold, a virgin shall be with
[47:08] child
[47:09] and shall bring forth a son, and thou
[47:12] shalt call his name Emmanuel,
[47:16] which being interpreted is God with us."
[47:20] Then Joseph, being raised from the from
[47:23] sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had
[47:26] bidden him, took unto him his wife, and
[47:30] he knew her not until she had brought
[47:33] forth her firstborn son, and he called
[47:36] his name Jesus. Amen. So, why don't we
[47:40] just go to the Lord in prayer? Father,
[47:43] we want to thank you today for your
[47:46] goodness and and for your love. Lord, as
[47:49] we think of the song that we have just
[47:53] got through singing, Down from your
[47:56] glory,
[47:58] redemption story,
[48:00] you becoming a God, a a a savior to us.
[48:04] Lord, we thank you for it. Now Lord, we
[48:08] ask that you would be with us as we
[48:11] honor your precious name as we begin to
[48:16] think and and maybe Lord ponder in our
[48:20] hearts, Lord, your great plan. And I I
[48:24] pray, Father, that your blessings would
[48:27] be upon us this morning. Be with those
[48:30] who can't be here, Lord. Encourage them
[48:33] and heal them, Lord Jesus.
[48:36] We ask father that you would just
[48:39] minister to every heart as we as we sit
[48:42] now and waiting upon you in the name of
[48:45] the Lord Jesus. Can the church say amen?
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[48:51] seated this morning. Amen.
[48:56] So we
[48:58] we are thankful for God's word and and
[49:03] for the clarity that God's word brings
[49:06] to us all. It's going to be a little I
[49:09] don't know. Um, you know, I I was
[49:12] telling the brothers, you know, I
[49:15] um uh just I've I've sort of had a a
[49:19] hard time this week just uh getting my
[49:23] mind on a on a on a certain uh Christmas
[49:27] message. And um and you say
[49:32] uh why would that be a problem?
[49:35] Um
[49:37] because Christmas is is big.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. redemption is big
[49:44] &gt;&gt; and and while the world is is thinking
[49:49] about a baby in a manger
[49:52] and um um they've got their Christmas
[49:56] trees and and um while kids are trying
[50:00] to figure out how Santa Claus gets comes
[50:02] down the chimney and and um and and
[50:06] ultimately trying to figure out where
[50:08] Santa Claus is at. you know what's uh
[50:12] chapter and verse he's in in the Bible
[50:14] and
[50:15] &gt;&gt; and um and and
[50:18] on the first Christmas how many gifts
[50:20] were given out to everyone and
[50:23] &gt;&gt; um
[50:24] you know there's just a lot of those
[50:26] things that the world's trying to think
[50:29] of on this Christmas and amen whereas
[50:33] the truth is there was no Christmas tree
[50:36] on Christmas there was no Santa Claus on
[50:39] Christmas
[50:41] &gt;&gt; there was no gifts given on Christmas.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was [snorts] um there there
[50:49] was no fireplaces and chimneys and and
[50:52] reindeer and Santa suits.
[50:56] So when we think about this Christmas
[51:00] season,
[51:01] I think it's it's imperative for us to I
[51:05] I thought maybe we would maybe go back
[51:09] in God's mind and and and his desires
[51:13] and and and maybe even ask the question,
[51:17] Amen, who is this mysterious Christ
[51:20] child? Um because uh he was definitely a
[51:26] mystery and I think the whole story of
[51:30] redemption,
[51:32] Amen, is is God becoming a human. And
[51:38] and I want us to just I just want us to
[51:40] deal with that here for a few moments
[51:41] this morning. And however it goes, I've
[51:44] got basically just a whole bunch of of
[51:46] scriptures here and and we'll just see
[51:48] how h how it goes. And if I flopped this
[51:51] this morning, just remember we're going
[51:53] to have a wonderful play this evening.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; That' be good.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God becoming a
[52:00] human.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; God becoming one of us.
[52:05] Uh uh and and and the ultimate the
[52:08] ultimate plan that God had in his mind
[52:11] was paying the ransom price.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; To pay the price of redemption. Amen.
[52:18] and and and and and to live h among and
[52:22] to live in his people.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; This is not about religion. This is not
[52:27] about uh uh uh creating some kind of a
[52:30] religious affair. This is about a king
[52:35] who had lost Amen. his prince. He had
[52:38] created a prince and his wife to rule
[52:41] the earth.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:43] &gt;&gt; And that prince Amen. and his wife uh uh
[52:48] sold the human race out to sin.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; And now Satan is is is having a rampage.
[52:57] He's he's he's taken control. Uh uh he
[53:01] found a way to get into humanity. And
[53:04] and so now his demons and and the powers
[53:09] of hell are now ruling and reigning.
[53:12] death is is is wreaking havoc. Families
[53:16] are being destroyed. Bodies are dying
[53:20] because of that first uh that the his
[53:24] son and daughter at the beginning.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; AND SO GOD'S GOT THIS IN HIS MIND. God's
[53:30] God's looked there and and there's only
[53:32] one way that God can can can fix it.
[53:36] There's only one way that God CAN FIX
[53:38] IT. HUMAN humans was given the key to
[53:43] the earth. God said in the beginning,
[53:46] God said, "Let them have dominion over
[53:50] the fish of the sea, the fowl of the
[53:52] air. Let them subdue the earth. LET THEM
[53:55] HAVE AUTHORITY over it." MAN HAS THAT
[53:58] AUTHORITY. BUT NOW HE'S UNDER, AMEN. he
[54:02] is under the demon influence. So the
[54:04] only way that God can come and fix IT
[54:07] ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WORD
[54:10] &gt;&gt; IS TO BECOME ONE OF US.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; He couldn't depend on he couldn't depend
[54:15] on on Adam's sons to be any better.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; He couldn't depend on anyone else to do
[54:21] anything any any more uh than what ADAM
[54:25] DID. THEY WERE ALL SINNERS.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Uh Cain Cain SLEW HIS HIS TWIN
[54:31] BROTHER.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. and and and and we find that amen
[54:35] it's just gone A THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
[54:38] of years of nothing but chaos, families,
[54:41] brokenness and and emptiness and Amen.
[54:44] But God HAD [screaming]
[54:46] A PLAN. And I just want to say, Amen.
[54:49] God God seen the chaos. God seen the
[54:54] confusion. God seen the sin before the
[54:57] world was even created. And God already
[55:01] had a plan.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; GOD'S DESIRE, AMEN, was to redeem us
[55:07] back. And the only way that God could
[55:10] redeem us back is to become one of us.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; And and what I what I'm going to deal
[55:17] with a little bit this morning, amen, is
[55:20] is God did not send the second person of
[55:23] the Godhead uh to to to become a human
[55:26] being. God himself
[55:31] &gt;&gt; came to earth
[55:33] &gt;&gt; in a body
[55:35] &gt;&gt; to redeem you.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; GOD, SOMEBODY SAY GOD HIMSELF
[55:40] &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF
[55:41] &gt;&gt; came to earth
[55:42] &gt;&gt; came to earth
[55:43] &gt;&gt; in a body
[55:44] &gt;&gt; in a body
[55:45] &gt;&gt; to redeem you
[55:46] &gt;&gt; to redeem you.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; That's big.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; That's bigger than Santa Claus. That's
[55:53] bigger than the elves. That's bigger
[55:54] than the North Pole. That's big.
[55:57] God becoming a human being to become one
[56:02] of us to feel our pain to understand our
[56:07] our our CONFUSED THOUGHTS TO YOU SAY GOD
[56:11] DIDN'T experience any of that. The Bible
[56:13] says he was in all points tempted.
[56:17] TEMPTED. SOMEBODY SAY TEMPTED. HE WAS HE
[56:20] WAS AT THAT STRUGGLE. AMEN. OF GOOD AND
[56:23] EVIL. HE HE KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Because he become one of us.
[56:32] This is not about religion. This is
[56:34] about restoring
[56:36] the fallen sons and daughters back to
[56:40] their rightful position. And I want to
[56:42] tell you, let's just look at the end of
[56:44] the story. The Bible says that we will
[56:46] rule and reign on earth again.
[56:50] What Adam lo what Adam and Eve lost in
[56:52] the beginning, the meek shall inherit
[56:56] the earth.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the end of redemption
[57:00] is bringing me and you. Hallelujah.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; We will not always BE IN CONFUSION. WE
[57:05] WILL NOT ALWAYS BE IN BODIES OF DECAY.
[57:07] WE WILL NOT ALWAYS UH UH uh uh be born
[57:10] and die. Amen. We are we ARE IN THE
[57:14] RIGHT NOW. WE ARE IN THE FINALITY OF
[57:17] GOD'S GREAT PLAN. It's just about time
[57:20] for us to go home, PUT ON OUR NEW
[57:22] BODIES. WELL, BLESS THE NAME OF THE
[57:24] LORD.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; But it could never have been done
[57:30] unless there had been
[57:36] &gt;&gt; God
[57:38] born
[57:40] a baby.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; God
[57:46] born a baby. Look. Look, look at that.
[57:49] You know, you think about this little
[57:50] baby that that that my wife's holding
[57:52] that grandbaby right there. Hallelujah.
[57:53] Get me a good-look fell.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? Could you imagine
[57:59] Mary that virgin girl holding
[58:03] Jehovah?
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Holding Je. You say, "I I I have a hard
[58:08] time believing that, brother. Jehovah.
[58:12] Jehovah being a baby." It was Jehovah
[58:16] laying in the crib.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; IT WAS Jehovah [screaming]
[58:22] playing on THE HILLSIDE.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; IT WAS JEHOVAH WHO WAS THERE IN JOSEPH'S
[58:28] CARPENTER SHOP LEARNING HOW TO BE A
[58:31] CARPENTER. GOD [screaming]
[58:34] BECAME ONE OF US.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; I think s Satan hides in the shadows of
[58:47] ignorance.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; You see, when there's when there's
[58:51] ignorance, he'll hold you in darkness.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when he has one over on you,
[58:59] then Satan prevails.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He his favorite line is ignorance
[59:05] is bliss. This This is Satan's favorite
[59:08] lines. Ignorance is bliss. Amen. Because
[59:12] if you don't know, then you don't have
[59:14] to worry about it. You can just ignore
[59:16] it.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[59:18] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, GOD DON'T WANT YOU BEING
[59:20] IGNORANT TO THIS GREAT PLAN OF
[59:21] REDEMPTION. GOD WANTS YOU TO KNOW
[59:23] EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND, WHAT he
[59:26] was doing AT THE BEGINNING SO THAT YOU
[59:29] CAN STAND AND IT WILL EMPOWER YOU IN THE
[59:32] DAY OF YOUR TEMPTATION. IT'LL EMPOWER
[59:35] YOU IN THE DAY OF WHEN EVERYTHING IS
[59:38] WREAKING HAVOC ON YOUR MIND AND IT FEELS
[59:41] LIKE IT'S ABOUT TO YOU'RE ABOUT TO
[59:43] EXPLODE. AMEN. GOD DON'T WANT YOU
[59:45] SITTING THERE IN IGNORANCE AND WONDERING
[59:47] IF YOU'RE A SON DAUGHTER OF GOD. DON'T
[59:49] WANT GOD [screaming] DON'T WANT YOU
[59:50] SITTING THERE IN IGNORANCE AND AND
[59:52] WISHING YOU COULD BE MORE THAN YOU ARE.
[59:53] GOD WANTS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE
[59:56] THAT THE THAT THE THOUGHTS THAT HE HAD
[59:58] ABOUT YOU IN THE BEGINNING, AMEN, WERE
[1:00:00] DIVINE THOUGHTS. THEY WERE HOLY
[1:00:02] THOUGHTS. THEY WERE POWERFUL THOUGHTS OF
[1:00:05] you being an overcomer.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; And so Satan will hide in the shadows of
[1:00:14] ignorance. But this isn't Amen. what God
[1:00:18] is has been wanting. It's and and and I
[1:00:20] and I and I I I look down through the
[1:00:22] seven ages. Amen. And we we have we've
[1:00:25] seen that it it was it was in Amen. Uh
[1:00:29] in the 300s. It was way back there. just
[1:00:32] 300 years after after Christ was born
[1:00:36] and he and he and he died and ascended.
[1:00:38] Amen. and and and and then religion came
[1:00:41] together and and and and formed the
[1:00:44] Catholic Church and and and uh and and
[1:00:47] and they put up uh statues of of Peter
[1:00:51] and Paul and Mary and and put these
[1:00:54] kinds of things up there and and and now
[1:00:57] MADE UH UH UH GOD, [screaming] THIS
[1:01:00] GREAT REDEEMER,
[1:01:02] THE THE THIS GREAT PLAN OF REDEMPTION.
[1:01:07] AND THEY THEY PUT it in in in in statues
[1:01:11] and AND AND BURNING OF CANDLES AND AND
[1:01:15] JUST GOING TO CHURCH AND SITTING there
[1:01:18] and amen letting the preacher preach at
[1:01:20] you. But and it's went through ages
[1:01:23] after ages all down through these seven
[1:01:25] periods of time in church history. We we
[1:01:28] we can see how how it came out. you
[1:01:30] know, the uh here come Luther and he
[1:01:32] resisted the Catholic Church and a and
[1:01:35] so he he was of that first Protestant
[1:01:37] movement and and BUT BUT YOU FIND THAT
[1:01:39] HE BROUGHT IN HE brought in so much of
[1:01:42] their junk with him and and then here it
[1:01:44] come in and Wesley and here it come
[1:01:46] until here we are in this last stage
[1:01:50] until God is just a myth
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; until it's the church is nothing but but
[1:01:56] light shows and music and and everyone
[1:01:59] all you know you can just Just just just
[1:02:00] just surf the internet. Amen. All I
[1:02:03] don't care. Even the Baptists, even
[1:02:04] they're are bouncing these days. Amen.
[1:02:06] They they got these lights and they've
[1:02:08] got the shows and they've got the music
[1:02:10] and everyone's Amen. But but but what
[1:02:12] about this MYSTERIOUS ONE? WHAT ABOUT
[1:02:14] THIS MYSTERIOUS? AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT
[1:02:16] TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING. AMEN. THERE
[1:02:18] THE THE THIS CHRIST CHILD THAT CAME, HE
[1:02:21] DID NOT COME TO START ANOTHER MOVEMENT.
[1:02:23] HE CAME FOR REDEMPTION.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; He came for a purpose. He had the
[1:02:26] thoughts OF GOD. I SAY HE WAS GOD.
[1:02:30] And that's what I want to deal with for
[1:02:31] a little bit here this morning. Can't
[1:02:33] you say amen?
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you tired of living
[1:02:37] in ignorance?
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Haven't we lived in ignorance long
[1:02:41] enough?
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the evening shadows, there
[1:02:46] shall be light.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that he's going to
[1:02:51] send a prophet in the evening time. And
[1:02:54] what was he GOING TO DO? TURN
[1:02:56] [screaming] YOUR HEART RIGHT BACK TO THE
[1:02:59] scriptures
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; so that you could see it the way God had
[1:03:02] it in the very beginning.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; It's in this day that God has has given
[1:03:10] us. Amen. The promise that the seals
[1:03:14] would be ripped off the book.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Now we understand that. Amen. This the
[1:03:19] book has has been probed at. It's been
[1:03:22] it's it's it's been talked about. It's
[1:03:25] been preached about. But Amen. But
[1:03:27] believe me, all all of these thousand uh
[1:03:30] uh denominations that we have today,
[1:03:32] they they all base their stuff off this
[1:03:34] book right here.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; They they base it all right here off
[1:03:37] this.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is because they haven't had a true
[1:03:41] understanding of God's plan of
[1:03:43] redemption.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; But did you know even in the book of
[1:03:45] Revelation, Amen, it was all written in
[1:03:48] symbols.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. written in symbols that was
[1:03:50] supposed to be released, revealed in
[1:03:55] this generation at the at the sounding
[1:03:58] of the seven church age messenger, the
[1:04:01] mysteries of the mystery singular of God
[1:04:06] shall be finished.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; So when we sit HERE THIS MORNING, I WANT
[1:04:14] US TO JUST ASK GOD, LORD, OPEN MY EYES.
[1:04:17] LET ME UNDERSTAND THIS CHRISTMAS LIKE
[1:04:20] I've never understood it.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; LET ME SEE IT THE way you want me to see
[1:04:25] it. Can you say amen?
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. So you can
[1:04:30] understand that the end time sign Amen.
[1:04:34] is the revealing of the son OF MAN.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE REASON.
[1:04:40] AMEN. And Jesus Christ, even in THE BOOK
[1:04:42] OF REVELATION, AS he was revealing
[1:04:43] himself, he was he WAS SOLIDIFYING WHO
[1:04:46] HE WAS. AMEN. You you can YOU CAN READ
[1:04:49] THAT ALL THROUGH REVELATION, IT IS JESUS
[1:04:51] SAYING, "I AM THE FIRST AND THE LAST. I
[1:04:53] AM THE ALMIGHTY GOD. I [screaming] AM HE
[1:04:56] THAT WAS AND IS and shall come."
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why are you spending these
[1:05:03] first few minutes on this?" is because
[1:05:06] denominationalism
[1:05:10] would separate us
[1:05:12] the holy God from his sons.
[1:05:16] Denominationalism,
[1:05:18] Amen. They they they they want to put
[1:05:23] everything that Christ was separate from
[1:05:26] God or that he was a Amen. And and and
[1:05:29] and and that God, you know, he sent his
[1:05:32] son. Well, I could you imagine any Could
[1:05:35] you imagine uh uh Kobe uh sending Simeon
[1:05:40] to go die? Amen. For somebody. Now,
[1:05:43] would that that that's pretty cruel.
[1:05:47] Amen. If if Kobe loves somebody and he
[1:05:50] wants to die for somebody, well, let
[1:05:51] Kobe die for somebody.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; But don't make his son go die for
[1:05:55] somebody.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; You say now, "Oh, you're throwing thin
[1:05:59] ice right now." I am saying
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; that God in order to un to make you and
[1:06:06] I to understand the great concepts,
[1:06:09] we're fathers, we're sons, we're humans.
[1:06:12] In order for us to understand the
[1:06:14] concept of what God is doing, God is
[1:06:17] going to say, "Amen. I'm going to create
[1:06:20] a body and call him my son, but I'm
[1:06:23] going to live inside that flesh. I'm
[1:06:28] going to redeem MY PEOPLE MYSELF. I AM
[1:06:33] NOT SENDING THE SECOND PERSON OF THE
[1:06:34] GODHEAD to do this.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not send you. Hallelujah. See,
[1:06:39] religion has it as God wants to kill you
[1:06:41] and Jesus wants to save you.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; RELIGION HAS IT THAT GOD WANTS TO AMEN.
[1:06:46] is it's just oh man, he's just ready to
[1:06:48] to make a grease spot out of you and
[1:06:50] he's created hell just for you. Amen.
[1:06:53] And then Jesus IS RIGHT THERE
[1:06:55] INTERCEDING. NO, [screaming] NO, NO.
[1:06:56] THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY'RE GOOD
[1:06:57] PEOPLE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:00] God wants you to understand
[1:07:02] that he was Jesus and that he is Jesus
[1:07:05] and Jesus is God.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; God [screaming]
[1:07:09] could not save you as a spirit. God
[1:07:13] could not redeem you as a spirit. GOD
[1:07:17] COULD NOT HEAL YOU AS A SPIRIT. BUT GOD
[1:07:21] CREATED A BODY AND THAT BODY WAS
[1:07:24] SINLESS. AND THAT BODY BECOME A
[1:07:27] SACRIFICE. AND THAT BODY HAS REDEEMED ME
[1:07:30] AND YOU. THAT IS [screaming] THE PLAN.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, can you say amen?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. So, denominationalism has made this
[1:07:44] into it's a religious thing. Just come
[1:07:46] to church. And by George, if you'd
[1:07:48] please come to church at least three
[1:07:50] times out of the month, man, that'd be
[1:07:52] nice.
[1:07:54] I wish you would too. I w Hallelujah.
[1:07:57] When you fall in love with Jesus and you
[1:07:59] find who Jesus is, you you just don't
[1:08:03] have no other choice but to serve him.
[1:08:05] It's not religion to you.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet would tell us is that
[1:08:13] revelation is opening up to bring us
[1:08:16] strength
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; to illuminate the word and to glorify
[1:08:20] his name.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; It was in the midst of the last two
[1:08:22] ages. the the two last ages that the
[1:08:25] revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:08:28] blossomed before us. Yes, he knew we
[1:08:31] knew he was God. How else could he be
[1:08:33] our savior? But to know that he was only
[1:08:37] God or God alone, that he was the alpha
[1:08:40] and the omega, that this Jesus was both
[1:08:44] Lord and Christ, making him Lord Jesus
[1:08:47] Christ, Father, Son, AND HOLY GHOST, ALL
[1:08:51] ONE PERSON. YEAH,
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; THAT had been lost in the since the
[1:08:54] first ages. And now we are seeing it
[1:08:58] again. The revelation of who he was has
[1:09:01] come back.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; INDEED, THE GODHEAD IS NOT A THREEPERSON
[1:09:06] GOD WITH one personality. It takes
[1:09:09] personality to make a person. IF THERE
[1:09:12] IS ONE PERSONALITY, there is but one
[1:09:15] person. Amen. But they who believe in a
[1:09:18] three persons have a three god godhead
[1:09:21] and are guilty of breaking THE FIRST
[1:09:23] COMMANDMENT. THE REVELATION OF THE
[1:09:25] GODHEAD IS BACK. THE TRUE church can
[1:09:30] build in strength again.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now you say, do you do
[1:09:41] you believe? Do do you do do you have
[1:09:43] scripture for this?
[1:09:46] Do you have scripture for anything at
[1:09:48] different?
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; You see, if people can't see the truth
[1:09:54] of the Godhead
[1:09:56] and and they fight it, they they can't
[1:09:59] ever see the rest of the truth of the
[1:10:01] scriptures
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; because the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:06] in his church and his works in the midst
[1:10:11] of the church for these last seven ages.
[1:10:14] YOU NEVER UNDERSTAND YOURSELF till you
[1:10:18] understand
[1:10:20] him.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Now, have I am I making my platform
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; pretty strong here this morning?
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want I want you to understand
[1:10:29] that there's a difference. God's not
[1:10:30] wanting us to just come and celebrate a
[1:10:32] baby in a manger. That's not Hallelujah.
[1:10:36] Amen. Matters of fact, all through the
[1:10:38] scripture, if you want to just get down
[1:10:40] to it, Amen. There is not one speck of
[1:10:42] scripture in there where where they uh
[1:10:46] observed the the birth of Jesus. Amen.
[1:10:50] They observed his resurrection.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; They they observed Well, praise the
[1:10:55] Lord.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; But they never did observe his his birth
[1:10:58] until, as I say, and it wasn't even in
[1:11:00] the first church until until later on.
[1:11:02] And the reason they'd done it is they
[1:11:05] were trying to introduce back in the
[1:11:07] 300s trying to introduce pagan Rome in
[1:11:11] with Christianity.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THIS NONSENSE
[1:11:17] THAT THEY BROUGHT UP AND THAT'S WHEN
[1:11:18] THEY CAME UP with the trinity by the way
[1:11:20] was back there in in in uh uh in the
[1:11:23] 300s. That's when the nian council
[1:11:25] that's when they came together. BUT I'M
[1:11:26] HERE TO TELL YOU, LET'S LOOK AT
[1:11:28] SCRIPTURE AND LET'S GO BEYOND ALL OF
[1:11:29] THIS, ALL OF THIS UH UH uh uh Christmas
[1:11:33] bliss
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; and LET'S GET A REVELATION [screaming]
[1:11:36] OF WHAT HAPPENED 2,000 YEARS AGO.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Hope this is all right.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:11:46] so I want to start out this morning that
[1:11:48] this [snorts]
[1:11:50] great mystery. The Bible says that there
[1:11:53] in in um uh first Timothy
[1:11:57] uh uh uh 3:16, I believe it is, Sister
[1:12:00] Keys. Amen. Great is the mystery
[1:12:05] uh without controversy. Great is the
[1:12:07] mystery of godliness. God was manifest
[1:12:12] in the flesh,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
[1:12:16] preached unto the Gentiles, believed on
[1:12:18] in the world, and received into glory.
[1:12:22] So God was manifest.
[1:12:26] Amen. One
[1:12:28] omnipotent spirit
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; manifested
[1:12:32] in three offices.
[1:12:35] Yeah.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Son, and Holy Ghost.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want you to keep that in
[1:12:43] mind. SOMEBODY SAY, "ONE GOD."
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; One God.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. MANIFESTED OR REVEALED in his
[1:12:51] fatherhood, revealed as a human, AND IS
[1:12:55] NOW REVEALED AS THE HOLY Ghost in you.
[1:12:59] Okay. the invisible God, the redeemer IN
[1:13:04] FLESH. [screaming] NOW HE IS THE SPIRIT
[1:13:07] IN the redeemed.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; All right. You say now, now let's look
[1:13:12] at it again. Invisible God.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Redeemer
[1:13:17] redeemed.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

[1:15:47] Write these down and then look at them
[1:15:49] in your scriptures. Amen. God was
[1:15:51] revealed as Jehovah Gyra. They're in
[1:15:53] Genesis 22 and 14. The Lord my provider.
[1:15:59] He was revealed as Jehovah Rafa. Amen.
[1:16:03] Genesis 15:26.
[1:16:05] The Lord
[1:16:07] who heals. He was revealed as Jehovah
[1:16:10] Nissi. Amen. and Exodus 17 and 15. The
[1:16:14] Lord is my banner.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; He was revealed AS JEHOVAH SHALOM. The
[1:16:19] Lord is my peace. Judges 6 and 24.
[1:16:23] Jehovah Raha. Amen. In as the Lord is my
[1:16:27] shepherd. Psalms 23. He was revealed as
[1:16:30] Jehovah Titskanu. Jeremiah 23 and6. The
[1:16:34] Lord our righteousness. HE IS REVEALED
[1:16:37] AS JEHOVAH SHAMA. AMEN. which simply
[1:16:39] means the Lord is there there in in
[1:16:43] Ezekiel 48 and35. So here God has
[1:16:47] revealed himself. And then the Bible
[1:16:49] says that he come on over into UH WHEN
[1:16:52] WHEN GOD REVEALED HIMSELF UNTO uh uh uh
[1:16:55] to Moses. Amen. After Abraham WAS
[1:16:58] ALREADY GONE, THEN GOD SAYS, "I WILL
[1:17:00] REVEAL MYSELF IN A NAME THAT NOT EVEN
[1:17:02] ABRAHAM KNEW."
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:17:06] SO GOD WAS REVEALING HIMSELF. IT WAS A
[1:17:09] CONTINUAL REVELATION OF HIMSELF
[1:17:11] THROUGHOUT THE OLD TESTAMENT. AND IT WAS
[1:17:13] GOD JUST revealing his characteristics.
[1:17:17] I'm your shepherd.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. To the other. A little bit later
[1:17:21] on, I'm I'm your banner. And then a
[1:17:24] little bit later on, I I I'm I'm your
[1:17:27] provider. ARE Y'ALL UNDERSTANDING? THIS
[1:17:28] WAS GOD'S
[1:17:30] PROGRESSIVE REVELATION THROUGHOUT THE
[1:17:32] OLD TESTAMENT. GOD WANTING TO LET HUMANS
[1:17:36] KNOW THAT I
[1:17:40] [laughter]
[1:17:41] I want fellowship.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; I want you to know that I'm your
[1:17:45] shepherd in your dark times. I WANT YOU
[1:17:47] TO KNOW THAT I'M YOUR HEALER when you're
[1:17:50] when you're sick. I WANT YOU TO KNOW
[1:17:52] THAT I'M YOUR PROVIDER WHEN YOU NEED
[1:17:55] PROVISION. IT WAS GOD REVEALING HIMSELF.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:18:03] But when it came to Jesus, Jesus,
[1:18:07] [laughter]
[1:18:09] [gasps]
[1:18:09] God emptied the whole Godhead,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; all of his names. When you look at When
[1:18:15] you look at at Jesus, he is the Lord, my
[1:18:19] provider. When you look at Jesus, he is
[1:18:21] the Lord, my healer. When you look at
[1:18:24] Jesus, he is the Lord, MY SHEPHERD. WHEN
[1:18:26] YOU LOOK AT JESUS, HE IS THE THE LORD,
[1:18:29] MY BANNER. IF I BE HIGH AND LIFTED UP,
[1:18:32] THEN I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO ME. WHAT
[1:18:36] WAS IT? IT [screaming] WAS GOD
[1:18:37] PROGRESSIVELY. PROGRESSIVELY. AMEN. It
[1:18:40] was revelation AFTER REVELATION AFTER
[1:18:42] REVELATION. GOD LETTING YOU KNOW, I'M
[1:18:44] COMING. I'M GOING TO COME. I'M GOING TO
[1:18:45] REVEAL. AND WHEN JESUS CAME, he was the
[1:18:49] fullness.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Good.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:18:58] was God.
[1:19:03] It was God crying in a manger.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; No, I that was Jehovah.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; You shall call his name Jesus being
[1:19:17] interpreted or Emmanuel being
[1:19:20] interpreted God with us
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; that Christmas morning. Hallelujah.
[1:19:32] What does stockings have to do with
[1:19:33] this?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; What does Christmas trees have to do
[1:19:36] with this?
[1:19:38] What what does Santa Claus have to DO
[1:19:40] WITH IT? WHAT IS ALL OF THIS STUPID
[1:19:42] NONSENSE? AMEN. THAT THIS WORLD, ALL
[1:19:45] IT'S DONE, IT IS IT is a tool OF THE
[1:19:47] ENEMY TO TAKE OUR ATTENTION OFF THE REAL
[1:19:50] THING THAT HAPPENED.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; GOD BECOMING A HUMAN.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; GOD [screaming] WAS OUR GIFT.
[1:19:58] GOD COMING DOWN TO GIVE YOU SALVATION.
[1:20:03] COMING DOWN TO LET YOU KNOW
[1:20:06] YOU WERE IN THE PRISON HOUSE OF SIN.
[1:20:09] SATAN HAD YOU BEAT DOWN BY ALCOHOL AND
[1:20:11] DRUGS AND PORNOGRAPHY. HE HAD YOU BEAT
[1:20:14] DOWN BY RELIGION. BUT JESUS CAME. IT WAS
[1:20:17] GOD [screaming] IN THAT BODY TO REDEEM
[1:20:20] YOU AND tell you who you were.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:25] Why is there no power in religion?
[1:20:30] Good question.
[1:20:32] Because God ain't there.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, my preacher preaches A GOOD SERMON
[1:20:36] EVERY SUNDAY MORNING. IF HE DON'T have
[1:20:38] an understanding of what REDEMPTION IS
[1:20:40] ALL ABOUT, IF HE'S MAKING if he's making
[1:20:42] a church just a little 15minute
[1:20:44] sermonette,
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT GOING TO DO FOR GOD'S
[1:20:48] PEOPLE?
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:20:53] You come from God.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; You're a son of God.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; You're a daughter of God.
[1:21:01] But you were lost in sin.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that you were in his mind
[1:21:09] before the foundation of the world.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; The B. Praise the Lord. Now, I got to
[1:21:14] stay on my I got to stay on my
[1:21:15] scriptures here because I don't want to
[1:21:17] leave you hanging. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now, now I I want us to
[1:21:23] really understand that. Now, let's look
[1:21:25] here in 1 John 5 and 7. Hallelujah. So,
[1:21:30] it's the creator,
[1:21:33] the redeemer,
[1:21:35] and then the Holy Spirit in the
[1:21:38] redeemed.
[1:21:40] Let's look here at John 5 and 7 while
[1:21:42] while we're on this topic here. For
[1:21:44] there are three that bear record in
[1:21:46] heaven. the Father,
[1:21:49] the Word, and the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:54] And these three are three.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; These three are
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; one.
[1:22:03] Then the next verse, and there are three
[1:22:05] that bear witness in the earth, the
[1:22:08] spirit, the water, and the blood. And
[1:22:13] these three
[1:22:15] are one.
[1:22:17] No, these three agree in one. We have
[1:22:22] the father, the word, the holy spirit in
[1:22:25] the heavens. And these three are one. We
[1:22:29] have the we we have the spirit, the
[1:22:32] water, and the blood on the earth. And
[1:22:35] these three agree in one.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; And what what what's he talking about?
[1:22:42] Well, God just in three offices. That's
[1:22:44] just one God. That's that's one God and
[1:22:46] three off. That was the fatherhood above
[1:22:48] us, the invisible God. Amen. Then it was
[1:22:50] then it WAS GOD IN THE body of Jesus
[1:22:53] Christ. Now it's the Holy Ghost in you
[1:22:57] and me. Not three gods. It is one God in
[1:23:01] three distinct offices.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[1:23:09] Good.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; I
[1:23:18] am a father.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; I am a son. My My dad's right here. And
[1:23:25] he will attest that I'm his. Amen.
[1:23:30] And I'm a human being.
[1:23:34] Amen.
[1:23:36] So I'm a father. I'm a son. and I'm a
[1:23:40] human being
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; now. If you're going to do it the way
[1:23:45] this nonsense goes in the church world
[1:23:48] today, we're looking for three different
[1:23:49] windowles.
[1:23:51] We're looking for the father. Have you
[1:23:54] seen Wendle the son? We wendle the human
[1:23:56] being. No, I'm all right here. Hello.
[1:23:58] I'm right here. I'm right here. I have
[1:24:01] three offices.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not your son. I'm not your
[1:24:05] son. Can't be your son. Amen.
[1:24:09] I I'm a father. You ain't mine. My dad
[1:24:12] ain't mine. Amen. But Caleb's mine.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I'M A HUMAN BEING. SO GOD,
[1:24:21] THE GREAT SPIRIT GOD,
[1:24:26] THE GREAT CREATOR, GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:30] DON'T [screaming] OH, GOD'S PRETTY BIG,
[1:24:31] AIN'T IT? GOD'S IT'LL MAKE YOUR it'll
[1:24:34] it'll IT'LL WHEN YOU STOP TO REALLY
[1:24:35] THINK ABOUT THE GOODNESS OF THE LORD AND
[1:24:38] WHAT [screaming] THIS GREAT ETERNAL GOD
[1:24:40] HAS DONE TO BECOME ONE of us. [snorts]
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Without reluctance,
[1:24:51] flesh and blood, his substance,
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; he took the form of man.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Revealed the hidden plan. Oh, glorious
[1:24:59] mystery.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; What can you say? Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE BECOMING THE
[1:25:06] SACRIFICE OF CALVARY. [screaming]
[1:25:09] NOW I know thou art the great I am.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love him. Can you say amen?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Bible says there in
[1:25:20] Colossians 2:9 again, for in him
[1:25:22] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[1:25:24] bodily. Then in 1 Corinthians 6 and19 to
[1:25:27] the redeemed, amen to you who have
[1:25:30] experienced the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:32] Ghost, he said, "What know ye not that
[1:25:34] your body is the temple of the Holy
[1:25:38] Ghost which is in you which you have of
[1:25:41] God? You are not your own." Can you say
[1:25:44] amen?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, the church of Pentecost
[1:25:47] knew that Satan wants to keep us away
[1:25:52] from that great understanding.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; But there in Isaiah 52 and6 and then
[1:25:58] turn there. That's that's okay. Amen.
[1:26:00] We'll we'll just take a little bit of
[1:26:01] time and quit whenever we need to. Amen.
[1:26:04] But but Isaiah 52 and 6.
[1:26:11] Hallelujah.
[1:26:14] Glory to God. Therefore, this is the
[1:26:16] prophecy.
[1:26:17] My people
[1:26:20] shall know my name.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, THEY SHALL KNOW IT in that
[1:26:26] day that I am he that does speak.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Behold,
[1:26:34] it is I.
[1:26:36] Now, now this is God. This is God. This
[1:26:39] is the invisible God speaking through
[1:26:40] his prophet.
[1:26:42] This is the great I am. This is Jehovah.
[1:26:45] Put it back up there, sister Keys.
[1:26:47] Therefore, my people shall know my name.
[1:26:50] I'm the invisible God. But in that day,
[1:26:53] therefore they shall know in that day.
[1:26:55] Underline that in your Bible. That day
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; that I am he that does speak. Behold it
[1:27:01] is I. Oh my. For the for the sake of
[1:27:04] time, let's go on down to the 14th
[1:27:05] verse. As many were astoned at thee, his
[1:27:11] vicious was so marred more than any man,
[1:27:15] and his form more than the sons of men.
[1:27:19] What wh what what what is God talking?
[1:27:21] He is he is saying in that day they're
[1:27:23] going to know that it is me. But when
[1:27:25] they look upon me,
[1:27:28] I'm going to be in a body.
[1:27:32] And my my body, my visage, my my my
[1:27:36] demeanor, my my looks are going to be
[1:27:40] worse than any mortal man.
[1:27:43] For I'm going to die and pay a price.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Because when I come, they will not know
[1:27:49] who I am.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; They won't know who I am. Can you say
[1:27:55] amen? Now, I want you to understand that
[1:27:58] God needed a body in order to redeem.
[1:28:03] Let's just let's just look at some more
[1:28:04] scriptures here real quickly. Amen.
[1:28:06] Zechariah 12 and 10. Are we doing all
[1:28:08] right this morning?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's just look at a FEW
[1:28:11] PROPHECIES. I WILL POUR THIS IS NOW
[1:28:14] LET'S I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU TIME to
[1:28:16] turn. Amen. Zechariah Zechariah uh 4 or
[1:28:21] 12 and 10.
[1:28:24] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:28] [clears throat]
[1:28:32] Zechariah
[1:28:33] 12 and 10.
[1:28:36] I will pour out upon the house of David
[1:28:39] and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:28:42] the spirit of grace and of
[1:28:43] supplications,
[1:28:45] and they shall look upon me. Now, who's
[1:28:48] who's talking? SPIRIT GOD WHOM THEY HAVE
[1:28:52] PIERCED. THIS IS GOD TALKING.
[1:28:56] AND THEY SHALL MOURN FOR HIM AS ONE
[1:28:58] mourneth for his only son. Shall be in
[1:29:01] bitterness for him as one that is in
[1:29:04] bitterness for his firstborn. This is we
[1:29:05] understand is when God comes back to
[1:29:07] reveal himself to Israel after the
[1:29:09] church is raptured up. Let's look here
[1:29:10] at Isaiah 45 and 22. Isaiah 45. And then
[1:29:15] we'll put these we'll put these
[1:29:17] together. Amen. 45 and 22.
[1:29:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:31] Look unto me. Somebody say unto me
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; and be ye saved, all the ends of the
[1:29:39] earth. For I am God and there is none
[1:29:42] else. I have sworn by myself.
[1:29:47] THE WORD IS GONE OUT OF MY MOUTH in
[1:29:50] righteousness and SHALL NOT RETURN. THAT
[1:29:53] UNTO me
[1:29:57] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[1:30:01] shall swear.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN?
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS HAD THIS DESIRE BUT GOD needed a
[1:30:10] body. Amen. to to express himself.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we just quoted
[1:30:20] there in 1 Timothy 3:16 without
[1:30:22] controversy. Great is the mystery of
[1:30:25] godliness. God was manifest in the
[1:30:28] flesh.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why we look
[1:30:31] there in Colossians 2:9. Amen. For in
[1:30:35] him dwelleth, and you can put it up
[1:30:37] there as I even though I'm repeating
[1:30:39] myself. For in him dwelleth all the
[1:30:42] fullness of the godhead bodily. Can you
[1:30:46] SAY AMEN? NOW LET'S look here in John 12
[1:30:49] and 44.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Write these down because I want
[1:30:53] you to look at them in your scripture
[1:30:54] time. Never take a preacher's word for
[1:30:57] it. Always go back and study scripture.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. First uh uh uh St. John 12 and 44.
[1:31:07] Amen.
[1:31:09] JESUS CRIED AND SAID, "HE [screaming]
[1:31:12] THAT BELIEVETH ON ME,
[1:31:16] BELIEVETH NOT ON ME,
[1:31:20] BUT ON HIM THAT SENT ME."
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; He that seeth me
[1:31:28] SEETH HIM THAT sent me.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. M
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1 and 12 or 1 and 15.
[1:31:39] Amen. Let's now now Jesus is saying he
[1:31:43] that believes on me believes on him.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; For when you've seen me,
[1:31:52] you've seen him.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's let's look here in
[1:32:00] cloth. You say, "Boy, this is the
[1:32:01] weirdest Christmas message I've ever
[1:32:03] had." Well,
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; you know,
[1:32:08] uh, Colossians 1:15.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you ready?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Who is the image?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Of the invisible
[1:32:21] God.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Christ is the image.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody say Jesus. Jesus
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; is the image
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; of the invisible God.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, that should make you want to shout.
[1:32:38] Let's let's go on up there to the 12th
[1:32:40] verse 1 and 12. Giving thanks unto the
[1:32:44] Father, which hath made us meat to be
[1:32:47] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:32:49] saints in light, who hath delivered us
[1:32:52] from the power of darkness, and hath
[1:32:55] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:32:58] dear Son, in whom we have redemption
[1:33:01] through his blood, even the forgiveness
[1:33:04] of sins, who is the image of the
[1:33:09] invisible God, the firstborn of every
[1:33:11] creature.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; WELL, ARE YOU HEARING ME? SO, HERE THIS
[1:33:15] CHRIST IS. AND THIS IS WHERE THE MYSTERY
[1:33:17] IS. This where it blows the mind. People
[1:33:19] can't put it together.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; They'd come up and talk to Jesus. And he
[1:33:25] says, "My meat is to do the will of him
[1:33:28] that sent me."
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:33:31] The body was the flesh was the son,
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; but the great eternal God lived inside
[1:33:42] him.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Listen, when you get when you get to
[1:33:46] heaven, when you get to heaven, what are
[1:33:48] we going to see?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; you're going to see one,
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; JESUS. FOR GOD DWELLS BODILY in that
[1:34:03] body.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Well, [laughter]
[1:34:12] this is something else that'll blow your
[1:34:13] mind. After the rapture is all taken
[1:34:15] care of, everything's all done. Did you
[1:34:17] know that the Son will deliver
[1:34:20] everything back up to the Father?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; It's what the Apostle Paul says. In
[1:34:26] other words, there will no longer be a
[1:34:29] reason for the blood. There will no
[1:34:32] longer be a reason. Redemption will have
[1:34:35] been complete. There is no are it's it's
[1:34:38] big. You can't rap. It takes divine
[1:34:41] revelation to UNDERSTAND IT WAS GOD in
[1:34:44] three offices. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:34:47] Amen. I I I my wife is I'm a husband to
[1:34:52] her. Amen. In another office, I am A I
[1:34:54] I'M A FATHER TO MY CHILDREN. AND AND
[1:34:57] ANOTHER OFFICE, I'M STANDING UP HERE
[1:34:59] THIS MORNING AS A PASTOR PREACHING TO
[1:35:01] YOU.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:07] GOD [screaming]
[1:35:08] SO BIG, SO GREAT, SO VAST.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if you were to go on down,
[1:35:21] let's just let's just keep on let's it's
[1:35:24] let's just keep on going. The 16th
[1:35:26] verse, for by him were all things
[1:35:28] created that are in earth that are in
[1:35:30] heaven, visible and invisible, whether
[1:35:32] they be thrones, dominions,
[1:35:34] principalities, or powers. All things
[1:35:37] were created by him and for him. He is
[1:35:40] before all things, and by him all things
[1:35:42] consist. He is the head of the church.
[1:35:44] Amen. who is the beginning, the
[1:35:46] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[1:35:48] things he might have the preeminence,
[1:35:50] for it pleased the Father, that in him
[1:35:53] should all fullness dwell.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:36:02] I I think it's
[1:36:04] I I I want us to I want us to catch
[1:36:06] this.
[1:36:10] There was a time before the world
[1:36:13] before there was creation. It was just
[1:36:16] it was just God and you couldn't even
[1:36:17] call him God then. There was you
[1:36:19] couldn't even call him God. He was
[1:36:20] because God is an object of worship.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; It was the great eternal being.
[1:36:26] But then when God created the angels and
[1:36:29] then then then he become that he become
[1:36:32] a god an an object of worship.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:38] God had all of these thoughts in his
[1:36:39] mind. Amen. And and these thoughts were
[1:36:43] eternally in his mind. They were they
[1:36:45] were there eternally. There was no He
[1:36:46] never had a new thought. God will never
[1:36:48] have he'll never have a new thought.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Nothing's new to God. God God knows the
[1:36:53] beginning from the ending. God is God.
[1:36:57] But when God wanted to express himself,
[1:37:02] when the thoughts were to come from the
[1:37:03] backside of his mind,
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:06] And when he spoke out of this invisible
[1:37:09] form come the logos.
[1:37:13] This logos is the great pillar of fire.
[1:37:15] Now I understand that this is a
[1:37:16] theological terms but the great logos of
[1:37:20] God.
[1:37:22] So this there's this great pillar of
[1:37:24] fire and then all of God's thoughts all
[1:37:28] that God was was moved in moved in
[1:37:32] dumped into this logos. This logos would
[1:37:36] is called the word. That's the reason
[1:37:38] why in the Bible says there in in in
[1:37:40] John 1 and1 in the beginning was the
[1:37:42] word. The word was with God. The word
[1:37:45] was God.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; So this God when he spoke out of out of
[1:37:50] this invisible form come this pillar of
[1:37:54] fire. That pillar of fire would be seen
[1:37:56] all throughout the Old Testament. That
[1:37:58] pillar of fire has has has appeared has
[1:38:00] come back to earth even today in our
[1:38:03] generation.
[1:38:04] That pillar of fire, that logos, that
[1:38:07] held all of the DNA of God, that held
[1:38:11] all of the thoughts of God. Amen. And
[1:38:14] and and and when when when he would
[1:38:16] speak, Amen. the worlds were created by
[1:38:20] that word. Can you say amen?
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; But that word that and that was
[1:38:26] wonderful. That was a visible form. He
[1:38:27] would appear to to some. Amen. Uh uh the
[1:38:30] the uh Moses seen him burning in there
[1:38:33] in the bush as the bush was on fire. Uh
[1:38:35] uh Abraham seen him when he appeared.
[1:38:37] You're wishing I would have had things
[1:38:39] wrote down. Hallelujah. A Abraham and it
[1:38:41] appeared to Abraham. Amen. In the great
[1:38:43] pillar of fire. He he appeared to to
[1:38:45] many throughout.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; But he was still in that great pillar of
[1:38:48] fire. But God God couldn't God couldn't
[1:38:52] know what a headache was like. God
[1:38:54] couldn't know what a the great pillar of
[1:38:57] fire. Even though he was ALL KNOWING,
[1:38:59] ALL WISE, ALL JUST, ALL IN HIM WAS
[1:39:02] REDEEMER, but again, he couldn't do it
[1:39:04] without it.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; So, IT WAS IT WAS THAT IT WAS THAT
[1:39:13] GREAT. IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS GOD
[1:39:15] [screaming] WANTING TO COME DOWN SO HE
[1:39:17] WOULD BE SEEN as the as the GREAT PILLAR
[1:39:20] OF FIRE ABOVE US.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:24] He would lead the children of Israel. He
[1:39:26] would appear to the prophets. He would
[1:39:28] come. He would make himself known. Oh,
[1:39:31] hallelujah. Now, catch this. Now, catch
[1:39:34] this. But then he man all of that pillar
[1:39:39] of fire held all of the DNA of God. Now,
[1:39:43] when Jesus was born, all the fullness
[1:39:45] was in that body.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; You say, "Do you know that to be the
[1:39:50] truth, Brother Wendle?"
[1:39:51] Well, when Jesus was was after Jesus was
[1:39:57] resurrected and ascended,
[1:40:00] Amen. way after the day of Pentecost, 30
[1:40:02] years down the road, the Bible says that
[1:40:06] great pillar of fire appeared unto Paul,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; It was so bright that it knocked him off
[1:40:12] his horse.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; And he looked up.
[1:40:17] And what did Paul say? Who art thou
[1:40:21] Jehovah?
[1:40:22] Now Paul, the Apostle Paul was he was he
[1:40:26] was head and shoulders above all of his
[1:40:28] equals. He knew the religion, the the
[1:40:31] Jewish religion like nobody's business.
[1:40:32] He was a student.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; And he knew that pillar of fire was
[1:40:36] Jehovah.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; So he so he responds and he says, "Who
[1:40:40] art thou Jehovah?"
[1:40:43] And the great light says, "I am Jesus."
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; YEAH. WHOM THOU PERSECUTEST.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't it hard for you to kick against
[1:40:53] the pricks?
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Right? Then the revelation come the very
[1:41:00] Now you go back and you read the Apostle
[1:41:02] Paul's writings and you'll understand
[1:41:04] his his revelation how he can interact
[1:41:07] interact. It was the great Jehovah God
[1:41:10] that was in the body of Jesus Christ for
[1:41:13] the sake of redemption. And are y'all
[1:41:16] are y'all catching this? How many's
[1:41:17] understanding what I'm saying?
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. FOR IT PLEASED THE FATHER
[1:41:22] [screaming]
[1:41:22] THAT IN HIM SHOULD BE ALL THE FULLNESS.
[1:41:26] LET'S LOOK HERE REAL QUICKLY. AMEN.

[1:41:31] too. How many of you kids can quote

[1:41:35] quote Isaiah 9 and 6?
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:41:46] Yeah.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; I shouldn't have put my fingers up
[1:41:55] there. Amen.
[1:41:58] Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. But I

[1:42:35] mighty God or Jehovah, the everlasting
[1:42:39] father, the prince of peace.
[1:42:42] WHO ARE THERE FIVE GODS IN THE GODHEAD?
[1:42:45] [screaming]
[1:42:46] NO. THERE'S ONE BODY, Jesus Christ,
[1:42:49] that'll have all of the attributes of
[1:42:51] God.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:53] MATTHEW 1:23, "BEHOLD, A VIRGIN SHALL BE
[1:42:57] WITH CHILD,
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; AND SHALL BRING FORTH A SON, AND THEY
[1:43:01] SHALL CALL [screaming] HIS NAME
[1:43:04] EMMANUEL, WHICH BEING INTERPRETED is God
[1:43:08] with us."
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen?"
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Why is it important that we believe
[1:43:16] this?
[1:43:17] Amen. Because if you're not, then you're
[1:43:19] a pagan.
[1:43:22] Hallelujah. God don't want no pagans in
[1:43:24] his house.
[1:43:26] [laughter]
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 6 and4.
[1:43:30] Hallelujah.
[1:43:32] Amen.
[1:43:34] Deuteronomy 6 and4.
[1:43:41] Here, O Israel,

[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; one. Deuteronomy 4 and35. Let's look at
[1:43:51] that. Let's just go through a bunch of
[1:43:53] scriptures here real quickly. 4 and35.
[1:43:58] Unto thee it was showed that thou
[1:44:00] mightest know that the Lord he is God,
[1:44:03] and there is none else beside him.
[1:44:07] Somebody say none else.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Beside him. Mark 12 and 29.
[1:44:14] Amen. Jesus comes back and reiterates
[1:44:17] it.
[1:44:19] in in Mark 12 and 29.
[1:44:24] Praise the Lord. Amen. And Jesus
[1:44:26] answered him, "The first of all
[1:44:28] commandments is here. O Israel, the Lord
[1:44:32] our God is one Lord." Let's go back here
[1:44:37] real quickly to Isaiah 45 and5.

[1:44:42] Hallelujah.
[1:44:45] Amen. Isaiah 45 and5.

[1:44:55] Amen. And and it says, "I am the Lord.
[1:45:00] There is none else. There is no God
[1:45:04] beside me." Are are you understanding
[1:45:08] what we're saying? Amen. Do we need to
[1:45:10] go back to Deuteronomy 32 and 39? Now,
[1:45:13] now uh see now that I even I am he and
[1:45:19] THERE IS NO GOD WITH ME.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; That
[1:45:35] great God who had no other God with him.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:42] that play that you kids are playing
[1:45:43] today
[1:45:45] that Christmas
[1:45:49] when that
[1:45:51] angel come to Mary and say Mary
[1:45:56] the scriptures have been declaring that
[1:45:59] God's going to have a body
[1:46:02] and that God's going to live in a virgin
[1:46:05] and this is going to be a great sign
[1:46:08] that God is on earth
[1:46:16] for Mary to hear that word
[1:46:22] that she was going to be the girl that
[1:46:26] gave birth
[1:46:30] to Emanuel.
[1:46:39] She runs and tells her husband or her
[1:46:42] she was she was uh uh engaged.
[1:46:46] Amen. They weren't they weren't married
[1:46:47] yet, but they had they had been engaged
[1:46:50] a spoused.
[1:46:52] She tells she tells
[1:46:55] Joseph,
[1:46:57] we read the story at the beginning.
[1:47:00] Joseph wanted to believe her.
[1:47:04] Joseph wanted to
[1:47:07] I mean she has been a good girl. She's
[1:47:09] she's godly. She's she's known among but
[1:47:12] here she is with child
[1:47:17] and Joseph's thinking as we read
[1:47:19] Joseph's thinking she's wanting me to
[1:47:23] protect her of her evil deed.
[1:47:27] And the Bible says that Joseph so loved
[1:47:30] her he couldn't marry her if she was
[1:47:34] Amen if she had if if she had been with
[1:47:36] another man. It was against the custom.
[1:47:38] So he was just going to privately put
[1:47:40] her away and not cause a big scene
[1:47:42] because he loved her. But he couldn't
[1:47:44] marry her.
[1:47:48] I mean, could you imagine? Could you
[1:47:49] imagine here? You're fixing to get
[1:47:51] married and the girl that you're getting
[1:47:52] married to shows up.
[1:47:59] and she was honest in her heart and
[1:48:00] she's looking at him saying, "An angel
[1:48:03] appeared to me and told me this was
[1:48:05] going to happen." And then the Bible
[1:48:08] says
[1:48:10] that while he was asleep, he was a just
[1:48:11] man and he studied these things. He was
[1:48:14] going back and looking through
[1:48:15] scriptures. He had been looking going
[1:48:17] back in his mind. Amen. At the scripture
[1:48:20] that that that that no doubt that
[1:48:23] Jehovah had had told the girl and and
[1:48:26] here and and here Mary was. Amen. And
[1:48:31] here Joseph was and he's not
[1:48:33] understanding. And here it was a it was
[1:48:36] such a complexing deal. Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] Yeah.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; And then God appeared to him in a dream
[1:48:41] and said, "Mary, oh, Joseph,
[1:48:43] that thing that is within Mary is a holy
[1:48:46] thing.
[1:48:48] This is this is the fulfillment of my
[1:48:50] promise."
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; She's going to give birth
[1:48:55] to the son of God.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; And it didn't say he didn't name him
[1:49:00] Emanuel. He said, "But he will be called
[1:49:02] Emanuel,
[1:49:03] and thou shalt name him Jesus."
[1:49:07] Can you can you imagine?
[1:49:09] Are are you hearing me? What is God's
[1:49:12] divine what is God's divine plan for the
[1:49:16] day?
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; God's got a divine plan for for him
[1:49:22] coming and that is to be born. That is
[1:49:25] to be revealed.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; There is going to be a people that's
[1:49:29] going to give birth to the word again.
[1:49:31] It's going to be a birth of perfection.

[1:49:49] redemption
[1:49:50] was when that invisible God
[1:49:54] come down
[1:49:56] and he walked with us,
[1:49:59] lived with us. Can you say
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, are are you hearing me?

[1:50:09] sayaith the Lord that created the
[1:50:10] heavens, God himself that formed the
[1:50:13] earth and made it. He hath established
[1:50:15] it. He created it not in vain. He formed
[1:50:18] it to be inhabited. I am the Lord and
[1:50:20] there is none else. Ephesians 4 and 6.
[1:50:24] There's one God and father above all who

[1:50:30] all and in you all. Well, praise the
[1:50:33] Lord. I mean, we could go on and on and
[1:50:35] on. Exodus 20 and1. And God spake these
[1:50:38] words saying, I am the Lord thy God
[1:50:41] which have brought thee out of the land
[1:50:43] of Egypt and out of the house of
[1:50:45] bondage, and thou shalt have no other
[1:50:46] gods before me. Exodus 34:14. For thou
[1:50:49] shalt worship no other god, for the Lord
[1:50:52] whose name is jealous is a jealous God.
[1:50:55] Can you say amen? I mean, we can go all
[1:50:57] the way down THROUGH THE SCRIPTURE.
[1:50:59] WELL, GLORY TO GOD.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD'S GREAT GOD'S great redemption

[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; 1 and
[1:51:42] Amen. There they're in Ephesians 1 and
[1:51:45] 20.
[1:51:48] for which he wrought in Christ when he
[1:51:50] raised him from the dead, set him at his
[1:51:53] own right hand in the heavenly places,
[1:51:56] far above all principality and power and
[1:51:59] might and dominion, and every name that
[1:52:03] is named, not only in this world, but
[1:52:06] also in that which is to come. and hath
[1:52:10] put all things under him, and gave him
[1:52:13] to be the head over all things to the
[1:52:16] church, which is his body, the fullness
[1:52:21] of him that fillth all and all. Well,
[1:52:25] somebody shout hallelujah.

[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; God coming. GOD CREATING THE BODY. GOD
[1:52:34] creating God. Amen. There he come

[1:52:39] him. But here they man they she he he
[1:52:42] was born
[1:52:44] under a a scandalous name that his mom
[1:52:47] was a was an adulteress that his mom it
[1:52:50] had been rumored that he he that that
[1:52:53] she had laid with a soldier a and that
[1:52:57] that that he was an illegitimate child.
[1:53:00] Amen. Jesus lived under that name. But
[1:53:03] yet God, can you imagine God coming un
[1:53:06] why would God why why why would God
[1:53:09] allow his son to just come under this
[1:53:12] scandalous name? Hallelujah. It didn't
[1:53:15] matter because he was coming to those
[1:53:18] people who were also Amen under
[1:53:20] scandalous names. Coming under people
[1:53:22] who were also Amen were that that were
[1:53:26] the outcast of the earth. Well, can you
[1:53:28] say amen?
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jesus came and Jesus DIED AND
[1:53:33] GOD HE DIED AS GOD'S PERFECT LAMB.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, IF YOU DON'T
[1:53:44] YOU YOU JUST PLEASE PLEASE DROP ALL
[1:53:46] EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE AND QUIT LOOKING
[1:53:48] AT A FATHER AND A SON AS IN TWO.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; I mean there IS THERE IS A FATHER AND
[1:53:56] THERE IS A SON.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; THERE IS
[1:54:00] GREAT JEHOVAH, GOD,
[1:54:03] and Jesus that was born
[1:54:06] and Jesus that came through a human
[1:54:08] life. But what we've got TO UNDERSTAND
[1:54:11] IS THE FATHER DWELT IN THE BODY OF
[1:54:15] JESUS.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; And you'll never find [snorts] you'll
[1:54:22] never find him too again.
[1:54:26] God lived in him. Well, praise the name
[1:54:29] of the Lord.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:54:32] just thinking of what if as is as as
[1:54:36] Amen. God did you know here's what Jesus
[1:54:39] the Bible says that that Jesus offered
[1:54:42] himself
[1:54:44] as the lamb.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Did you know that? Jes Jesus G praise
[1:54:50] the Lord. He was Jesus was so strange.
[1:54:52] Amen. He says, "Destroy this temple and
[1:54:54] in three days I will raise it up again.
[1:54:58] Amen.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; They thought he was talking about
[1:55:02] Solomon's temple. They said, "Man, it
[1:55:04] took 40 years to build this thing." What
[1:55:05] are you talking about? Hallelujah.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. He went down to
[1:55:10] the grave and the spirit that lived on
[1:55:12] the inside of him raised him back. Well,
[1:55:14] I just I'm just trying to tell you I'm
[1:55:16] just trying to tell you. Quit quit
[1:55:17] trying to mix this up as if there's two
[1:55:19] gods. God created that body to come and
[1:55:23] live within you and me. Amen. Now, as as
[1:55:26] as dad quoted that quote and as we and
[1:55:28] the musicians can get ready to come.
[1:55:30] Amen. That Christ that God so was was so
[1:55:36] pleased with the sacrifice of that
[1:55:39] sacrificial lamb. He was so pleased with
[1:55:42] that body. He was so pleased. Amen. That
[1:55:46] he raised him from the dead.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:52] And has seated him. Amen. in the heavens
[1:55:56] so far above the heavens, above the
[1:55:59] angels, above sin, above a preacher,
[1:56:03] above the pope, he has raised him and
[1:56:06] given him a name above all names that at
[1:56:10] the name of Jesus every knee should bow.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Raised him at his own right hand.
[1:56:22] Raised him. Go back and look in the
[1:56:24] Bible and see what God says about his
[1:56:25] right hand that's always representing of
[1:56:28] power.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; But how can you get on the right hand of
[1:56:31] a spirit?
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; How can you get on the right hand of a
[1:56:37] spirit?
[1:56:39] Psalm says, "If I should rise up on the
[1:56:41] wings of the morning, thou art there. If
[1:56:43] I should make my bed in hell, thou art
[1:56:44] there. Where can I go to get away from
[1:56:48] your presence?"
[1:56:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:53] But what he did tell him,
[1:56:57] [music] this one here, I'm so pleased
[1:56:59] with. I've given him a name.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Given him my name.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Well, I I I I hope this is all right
[1:57:08] here this morning. [snorts]
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, the great redeemer.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:19] See, if you don't if you don't have that
[1:57:20] revelation, if you don't have that
[1:57:22] revelation, you're going to have God the
[1:57:24] Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
[1:57:25] Ghost.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, let me let me just say this.
[1:57:29] How can there be an eternal son?
[1:57:34] Eternal means you never had an ending
[1:57:35] and never had a beginning.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus had a [music] beginning and Jesus
[1:57:38] had an ending,
[1:57:40] right? He was crucified.
[1:57:44] So eternal son is is is just nonsense.
[1:57:47] It's the eternal God living in that
[1:57:49] body.
[1:57:51] But then we got another we got another
[1:57:53] problem here too. And that is that is um
[1:57:56] [music]
[1:57:56] um
[1:58:01] Jesus father
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; as we read the opening scripture. Amen.
[1:58:06] And he that Jesus
[1:58:12] [snorts] Jesus father was the Holy
[1:58:14] Ghost.
[1:58:15] Did we did did we not read that?
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; He meant Jesus father was is the Holy
[1:58:20] Ghost. And he says that Amen. in in a
[1:58:22] couple of places here.
[1:58:26] Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[1:58:32] Um, I have
[1:58:34] I have [music] u
[1:58:44] I have the three. [music]
[1:58:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:52] There was [music] three places here and
[1:58:53] I
[1:59:00] Well,
[1:59:04] [snorts]
[1:59:11] thou art the great
[1:59:14] I am. [music]
[1:59:20] Oh, how
[1:59:23] I love him.
[1:59:28] How I
[1:59:31] adore him,
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; my breath, my son, [music]
[1:59:44] my all
[1:59:48] [music] in all [singing]
[1:59:52] the great
[2:00:00] became
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; my savior [singing and music]
[2:00:08] and all
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; God's fullness
[2:00:16] dwelling.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[2:00:24] Now
[2:00:26] I hit three [music] different places
[2:00:28] where it was said but there in
[2:00:32] Matthew 1:18 [music]
[2:00:33] it says now the birth of Jesus Christ
[2:00:36] was on this wise as his mother Mary was
[2:00:39] a spouse to Joseph
[2:00:41] before they come [music] together she
[2:00:43] was found with child
[2:00:46] of the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:49] Mark comes back and says that she
[2:00:51] conceived of the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:59] We've [music] got problems now because
[2:01:00] now Jesus has two daddies, the Father
[2:01:04] and the Holy Ghost.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; You see how religion has made this thing
[2:01:09] [music] so crazy?
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; It's one God
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; living himself.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, [music] sir.
[2:01:19] God above us.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; God with [music] us.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; God in us.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "God above us."
[2:01:31] [music]
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; God with us.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; God in us.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we have to have
[2:01:40] the new birth.
[2:01:42] That's why that's why he says
[2:01:45] there in in 1 Peter [music] 1:23, Sister
[2:01:48] Keith, that we have to be born again,
[2:01:51] right?
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; And being born again not of [music]
[2:01:54] corruptible or sexual seed, but of
[2:01:56] incorruptible by the word of God, which
[2:01:59] liveth [music] and abideth
[2:02:02] forever. We're born again.
[2:02:05] Jesus [music] told him, and said,
[2:02:06] "Except a man be born again, he cannot
[2:02:09] enter into the kingdom of God."
[2:02:11] Nicodemus says, "I'm an old man. How can
[2:02:13] I go back into my mother's womb?" Jesus
[2:02:16] said, "How is it that you're a [music]
[2:02:17] wise teacher of the law, and you don't
[2:02:20] understand this?
[2:02:22] That is born of the flesh is fleshly.
[2:02:24] That that is [music] born of the spirit.
[2:02:28] You've got to be born of blood and of
[2:02:31] spirit." Jesus was saying, "I am coming
[2:02:33] [music]
[2:02:34] to give you life."
[2:02:37] This new birth that takes place
[2:02:40] is God's eternal gene seed
[2:02:44] that's already been laying in your heart
[2:02:46] from before the foundation of the world.
[2:02:48] God already predestinated you. You've
[2:02:49] already been put in his lamb lamb's book
[2:02:51] of life.
[2:02:52] But now it's God just as God
[2:02:55] touched the womb of Mary. Now, she she
[2:02:58] was
[2:03:02] just for your information since I'm
[2:03:04] [music] just giving it out this morning.
[2:03:07] Mary gave birth to Jesus. But did you
[2:03:10] know that [music] Mary had to go back to
[2:03:12] the upper room and have a new birth?
[2:03:15] Mary had to receive the Holy Ghost, too.
[2:03:17] Mary gave birth. [music]
[2:03:19] Her physical womb gave birth, but then
[2:03:23] she had [music] to be born again.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Good.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you can have a new
[2:03:28] birth?
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; I always say, "Hey, man." I I always
[2:03:33] say, "Well, those that are struggling
[2:03:34] with this and struggling with that,
[2:03:36] well, it's going to be okay. Just just
[2:03:37] [music] get born again.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Get born again. Let God come and live on
[2:03:42] the inside of you." I know Christianity
[2:03:44] has it. Well, I've accepted Jesus into
[2:03:46] my heart. I come to an altar and I've
[2:03:48] accept Jesus into my heart. You don't
[2:03:50] accept Jesus into your heart. You don't
[2:03:52] accept him into your heart until that
[2:03:54] new birth. Now, you can you can you can
[2:03:56] accept his forgiveness.
[2:03:58] Father, forgive me.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; But but but but Jesus doesn't come into
[2:04:03] the heart until you've been born again
[2:04:04] [music]
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; till the new birth,
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; you repent, you be baptized, [music]
[2:04:13] and you shall RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE
[2:04:15] HOLY GHOST. So receiving Jesus into my
[2:04:18] heart is not that that that that that
[2:04:21] [music] it's it's it's it's not just you
[2:04:23] know this fictitious thing that God's
[2:04:25] going to come and now I've accepted him
[2:04:27] and wink wink [music] now God is living
[2:04:29] in me. No, I'm talking about just as
[2:04:32] genuine as as Mary had that something
[2:04:36] ignited in her womb.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; So is it going to happen in the [music]
[2:04:41] hearts of God's children?
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Amen.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; You couldn't receive the Holy Ghost
[2:04:46] until the sin was paid for.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. All God's fullness.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, how
[2:05:05] I love.
[2:05:10] How I
[2:05:18] My breath,
[2:05:20] my son,
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; my all in [music] all,
[2:05:33] the great
[2:05:49] And now
[2:06:02] 1 Timothy 1:17. Now unto the king,
[2:06:05] eternal, immortal, invisible, the only
[2:06:08] wise God, be honor, glory forever and
[2:06:11] ever.
[2:06:14] John 1:18, no man hath seen God at any
[2:06:17] time, the only begotten Son, which is in
[2:06:20] the bosom of the father, he has [music]
[2:06:23] declared him.
[2:06:26] So my my my my point is this. What is
[2:06:29] God doing today? First 1 first Timothy 2
[2:06:32] and5 there's there is [music] one God
[2:06:36] and one mediator between God and men the
[2:06:39] man
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ 2 Corinthians 5:19 to w
[2:06:45] that God was in [music] Christ
[2:06:48] reconciling the world unto himself.
[2:06:52] Well that should make you want to shout
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; now.
[2:06:57] Now that sin is over.
[2:07:00] Now that [music] sin has been dealt
[2:07:01] with. Now the Holy Spirit can come down
[2:07:03] upon me. And he's living again today.
[2:07:06] Living in boys and girls, [music] living
[2:07:08] in men and women. God is having
[2:07:11] preeminence over his people once again.
[2:07:13] Oh, how
[2:07:15] I love
[2:07:18] him.
[2:07:21] How I
[2:07:23] adore
[2:07:25] him. [singing]
[2:07:26] [music]
[2:07:28] My breath,
[2:07:31] my son.
[2:07:33] He's living in me,
[2:07:36] my all
[2:07:38] in all. [music]
[2:07:40] The great creator,
[2:07:43] the great
[2:07:46] creator
[2:07:48] [singing and music]
[2:07:51] became
[2:07:53] [singing] my savior.
[2:07:59] and all God's [music] fullness.
[2:08:03] [singing]
[2:08:06] Well,
[2:08:10] in him
[2:08:14] down from
[2:08:16] his glory,
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[2:08:22] ever living
[2:08:25] story, [singing]
[2:08:29] My God [singing] and Savior
[2:08:34] came [music]
[2:08:37] and Jesus [singing]
[2:08:40] was [music]
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; born in
[2:08:47] a manger.
[2:08:49] [music]
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; To his own a stranger.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; To his own
[2:08:55] a stranger.
[2:08:56] Oh God. Oh [music] God.
[2:09:00] A man. [singing]
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; A man of sorrows,
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; tears,
[2:09:08] and agony. [music]
[2:09:12] Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you
[2:09:14] love him? Oh, [music]
[2:09:16] how?
[2:09:20] Oh, Jesus, I love you.
[2:09:24] How
[2:09:31] my breath [music]
[2:09:36] shine
[2:09:39] my [singing]
[2:09:40] own. [music]
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:46] The great
[2:09:49] creator
[2:09:54] became
[2:09:56] [music]
[2:10:02] and all God's fullness
[2:10:16] I feel like I've just been so scattered
[2:10:19] this morning.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; But if you can understand, see
[2:10:28] the Old [music] Testament
[2:10:30] was the law and that the law of God that
[2:10:34] was God's that was [music] revealing a
[2:10:35] lot of God's nature. He was holy. He was
[2:10:38] pure. But it was also revealing
[2:10:41] the fallen nature of [music] me and you.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; And under the bulls of under [music]
[2:10:50] under the blood of bulls and goats,
[2:10:56] there just wasn't really [music] much
[2:10:57] hope for us. I mean, we were we were
[2:10:59] just scandals.
[2:11:02] Even Israel, the ones that God called,
[2:11:03] they were just they were just
[2:11:06] and
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. And the law was there just it it
[2:11:11] doomed them. But then but then God gave
[2:11:13] them the lamb and the lamb rolled the
[2:11:16] head roll ahead the sins [music] because
[2:11:18] the innocent lamb could not that the
[2:11:20] lamb never knew sin. But the n the lamb
[2:11:23] never knew what it was to be a man.
[2:11:25] Never knew what it was to have problems.
[2:11:32] But in between it all, God would always
[2:11:33] show grace. He would he would give grace
[2:11:35] to Abraham. [music] He would call
[2:11:39] David by grace he would he would show
[2:11:42] elements of [music] grace coming down
[2:11:43] through
[2:11:45] so that we could come to this day to
[2:11:47] understand
[2:11:49] to truly [music] understand
[2:11:53] that the only one that can make the
[2:11:54] sacrifice for us brother Kevin
[2:11:57] is God [music] himself to do it for us
[2:12:04] and that's what he done.
[2:12:08] So, there's not a God that is that is
[2:12:11] looking [music] that that's just trying
[2:12:12] to find fault in you to to take you to
[2:12:15] hell. It's God that was doing everything
[2:12:18] he could to bring you [music] back to
[2:12:20] himself.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so important.
[2:12:26] It's important for you kids to
[2:12:27] understand that in as you're growing up,
[2:12:30] this is this is this is truly God. This
[2:12:33] is crazy. God was a teenager. [music]
[2:12:39] Do do you see what I'm saying? How how
[2:12:42] much he loves us? He loves us. And then
[2:12:45] he's coming this day as the [music]
[2:12:47] great God Almighty to make sure that you
[2:12:49] know. So this morning, I don't know, you
[2:12:53] know, I don't know what what you guys
[2:12:56] have planned. If you know, uh uh you
[2:12:59] know, some people don't believe in
[2:13:00] giving gifts. Some people [music] do.
[2:13:03] Some become full-blown pagans and
[2:13:05] others, you know, uh, you know, hey,
[2:13:09] [music]
[2:13:12] but I just [laughter]
[2:13:18] I I I I just want us to know I I want us
[2:13:20] to leave here. It would be so incredibly
[2:13:22] great if we could leave here with no
[2:13:24] condemnation.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be Wouldn't it be wonderful
[2:13:28] on this morning that we have this is our
[2:13:30] this is our Christmas day, [music] okay?
[2:13:32] And and wouldn't it wouldn't it be
[2:13:36] wonderful if if this morning we could
[2:13:38] leave here with [music] no condemnation?
[2:13:41] Nothing in in you at all, Aaron, that
[2:13:43] says
[2:13:46] you're not good enough,
[2:13:49] that you'll never be. that
[2:13:52] it'd be so wonderful for you [music] to
[2:13:53] leave this place this morning and know
[2:13:55] him
[2:13:57] Jesus Christ, God come to earth in a
[2:14:00] body to die [music] for me. And that's
[2:14:03] what Christmas means to me.
[2:14:06] And that there's nothing that's ever
[2:14:07] going to pull me away [music] from God.
[2:14:10] That if I fail, I've got plenty of
[2:14:11] blood. And it's not a lamb blood. And
[2:14:13] it's not a and [music] it's not just
[2:14:15] human blood. It's the blood of God.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; And that's going to keep me right there.
[2:14:19] Amen.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; How about you
[2:14:23] to say, "No matter what my problems are,
[2:14:25] no matter where I'm at,
[2:14:28] Christmas done it for [music] me.
[2:14:32] God who wrote all of his laws, God who
[2:14:34] had all those Old Testament God
[2:14:38] when no one [music] else could pay the
[2:14:39] price for me, God come in a body for
[2:14:41] me." And he done it for you.
[2:14:44] [music] No matter how what you're
[2:14:46] struggling with, no matter what you're
[2:14:47] going through, he done it for you. He
[2:14:50] loves you.
[2:14:53] If we could do that,
[2:14:55] if we could have [music] that
[2:14:58] rich revelation in our heart
[2:15:01] that I'm going to make it
[2:15:05] because he done what it took for me to
[2:15:07] make it.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it because he
[2:15:15] Praise the Lord. You love him. Amen.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Without
[2:15:21] reluctance, [singing]
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; flesh and blood, [music]
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; substance,
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; the form
[2:15:38] of man.
[2:15:42] reveal
[2:15:44] the hidden.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, glorious mystery.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, glorious mystery.

[2:17:08] fullness

[2:17:15] in him. [singing]
[2:17:22] this morning.
[2:17:25] Why don't you prepare a place in your
[2:17:28] heart?
[2:17:36] Prepare a place of worship for him.
[2:17:41] He's no longer a a baby.

[2:18:15] I pray Lord that the simplicity
[2:18:19] of who you are
[2:18:24] would be made real to us and
[2:18:28] scriptures just cannot contradict one
[2:18:30] another.
[2:18:33] But when we see the full scope of what
[2:18:35] you [music] are,
[2:18:40] that the whole plan is nothing but you
[2:18:42] becoming flesh in us.
[2:18:46] Oh God,

[2:19:05] strivings and all of our
[2:19:08] trying to make things happen. Let us let
[2:19:11] it just fall.
[2:19:14] Let it just rest in you.

[2:19:21] me according to thy word."
[2:19:24] And Lord, just bless all of the children
[2:19:26] today. Bless [music] all of the mamas

[2:22:21] verse. It was a tiny simple staple

[2:22:34] for a king [music] to be born.
[2:22:38] He didn't choose some place special
[2:22:43] to reveal [music]
[2:22:44] his majesty.
