I don't have any written requests, but we do need to remember brother Luke uh Lancaster. Um they took him to the hospital earlier today. And so, let's just remember him in our prayers. I'm going ask brother John if if he would mind coming and and leading us in prayer. If you guys have a need upon your heart, just make it known by the lifting of your hand here tonight. Amen. God bless you now. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir. Appreciate you. &gt;&gt; Oh, dear heavenly father. Lord, we're thankful for the opportunity to come talk to you again, Lord, and to hear from you, Father. Lord, this is the kind of like the highlights of our week, Father, knowing when we can come and commune with you, Father. And we have our secret places, Lord, that we can come and and talk to you oneon one, Father. But when we come here and we hear the messages come for us and the words that you give us, correction, if we need it or love when we need it, Father, you always meet us. You're always here. So Lord, we stand before you a needy people. Father, I know there was only the request for Brother Luke and Lord, I hope you touch him. I pray that you will. You promised you would. We're standing on your word, Lord. But Lord, all of the other requests and the needs is flowing through your people. We ask you to reach down and touch them, too. For you're a supernatural, God, and I know that you can do the supernatural whether the requests come out or not. So, God, I ask you to touch every need in the building, Father, in the only way that you can. And be with us in the service. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Thank you.

Praise the Lord. Well, I've been telling myself I need to practice. Haven't picked up the guitar much in a while. And it's harder to remember the words, brother Wendle, to our songs. Amen. Amen. If you know the words, you can sure help me. Just as long as I have Jesus, there's no way for me to lose. Even though this life grows weary along the way. And just as long as I can feel him and I know he's by my side. It's so good to know he's with me every day. And just as long as I have Jesus, I never worry. even lest I stray. And he is always near me when I call and he meets my every need. It's so good to know he's with me every day. Oh, listen. Well, there's been times I know I've felt him and I know I've caused him pain. Yet by rights there is nothing that I can say. Yet through mercy he forgives me gives me strength to try again. It's so good to know he's with me every day. And just as long as I have Jesus, I never worry. in his arms of love. He keeps me when I stray. And he is always near me when I call. And he meets my every need. It's so good to know he's with me every day. Would you help me? And just as long as I have Jesus, I don't have to worry. In his arms of love he keeps me when I stray.

Did you enjoy that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. He is my everything. He is my all. He is my everything both great and small. Yes, Lord. He gave his life for me. Made everything new. He is my everything. None other will do. Sing that again now. He is my everything. My heart is small. He gave his life. He gave his life for me. made everything new. He is my everything none other will do. Amen. Is that how you feel tonight? What a friend we have in Jesus and all our sins and grief to bear. Oh my a privilege to carry. Oh, everything to God in prayer. Oh, what peace. And oh, what peace we often for. And oh, what needless pain we bear. Amen. And all because And all because we do not care. Oh, we thank to God. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wasn't quite ready for that, but for the glory of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Last time I tried this song, I forgot the word. So, Lord willing, it'll be better this time. every once in a while. An old friend of mine will stop by and ask me where you been, what's on your mind. They wonder why I'm not drinking and painting the old town red. Tell them I'm serving Jesus now and the old man is dead. I used to live such a wicked life. I had no hope inside. I was lost in darkness, searching for the light. And then one day in the little church after hearing what the preacher said started serving Jesus and the old man is dead. And this man you see before you may look a lot the same. I may wear the same old clothes, have the same old name, but you're looking on the outside. Please look inside instead. You'd find a brand new man. Because the old man is dead. Cuz the man you see before you may look a lot the same. I may wear the same old clothes. wear the same old name, but you're looking on the outside. Look inside instead and you'd find a brand new man. Cuz the old man is dead. Amen. Amen. You see that? Thinking of that song the cathedrals used to sing. And no one can sing it better than George John's. Thanks to Calvary. I'm not the man I used to be. And tell you what, I I can't go back and and listen to that ever without crying and thinking of what the Lord has done for me. And all I can say is thanks to Calvary. I'm not the man I used to be. Thanks to Calvary, I don't go there anymore. I mean, I mean, what a what a love we ought to have for Christ tonight. Amen. The out outward man may look the same, but it's that inward man, Brother John, that that's been changed and renewed. Amen. Can't we sing this as the man of God gets ready to come? Let's try F. He touched me. Oh, he touched me. Oh shackled by your hand the burden. I was beneath a load of guilt and shame. Then the hand of Jesus touched me. Yes, he did. And now I am no longer the same. How many can say this tonight? He touched me. Yes, he did. Oh, he touched me. And oh the joy that floods my soul. You see something has happened. And now I know he touched me and made me whole. The second verse. Oh, and since I met this blessed savior, ever since he cleansed and made me whole and I shall never cease to praise him. How about it tonight? Thank you, Lord. And I will shout it. I'll eternal he rose with all your heart. He touched me and all the joy that flood to my soul. Something has happened. And now I know he touched me and made me whole. Amen. Has he touched you here this evening? Amen. The Lord has certainly got a way of touching his people, making things that are wrong, right? He seems to always have the words to say, the ability to mend all the things that have been broken. Amen. How many just want to be touched by the Lord here this evening? Amen. Do you enjoy the service this morning? Amen. Certainly certainly enjoyed the service this morning. Appreciate uh brother Windle just speaking what the Lord leads on his heart and and uh just always appreciate that about him and amen just telling us what we need to hear and what the Lord's just placed on his heart and we just want to thank him for that. Um but if we could I'd like to go ahead and go into our scriptures here. Uh I'd like to start Exodus and Exodus 3 and believe it's the seventh the seventh verse. We have Exodus 3 and7 and the um scripture reads thus. And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reasons of their taskmasters. For I know their sorrows, and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of the land, unto a good land, and a large, and a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Parizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jeb Jebusites. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come up unto me. I have also seen the oppression where the Egyptians oppressed them. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can just bow our heads to the Lord here this evening. Heavenly Father, we just appreciate you, Lord. And &gt;&gt; and God, we just want to thank you for your love and your grace and your mercy, Lord. And we just want to thank you for just being with all of us. &gt;&gt; We just pray, Lord, that your word would just go forth, Father, and it would just, Lord, touch where it needs to be, Lord. Just keep us from saying anything, Lord. Help us to say something, Father, to help your people in Jesus name. Amen. You could be seated here this evening. And um as again I sure enjoyed the service this morning and and um you know and if I could just for a few moments um I've been kind of th uh kind of dwelling on this thought and just kind of going back and forth just touching on things here and there and I was kind of drawing some of my inspiration from some of the messages uh brother Wendell and brother Harry had spoken uh spoken on uh here this this last little bit there. Brother Window was talking about the taking the land there there in Ewima, you know, and then you had uh brother Harry where he was uh took the Thanksgiving sermon and he was talking about uh uh a new land and and that's what kind of triggered my thought here this evening. So I was just kind of thinking about that about how that uh you know thinking about this new land uh when he was up there and he was speaking about it and it kind of triggered my thought and some of my my thinking and I was thinking about how that sometimes when you talk about a new land it um it's surrounded by you know the unknown or it's surrounded by could be surrounded by opportunity you know or a new beginning and so I was kind of thinking about that as as kind of my theme or Like again like I said my my thought process and and I began to look up just kind of a few times a few places and where humanity has kind of uh pioneered or kind of just uh kind of moved on moved in the unknown in life and was just kind of just seeking places that where where uh there was opportunity you know or there's a place of new beginning and and uh and you know each one of us you know each one of these things that I had I was thinking about or that I had looked into you know every one of every one one of them, you know, uh they they had obstacles and they had things in their way in order uh you know that stood in their way for in for them to kind of achieve what they were after. And I was kind of looking at some of the things and a lot of us know about the Oregon Trail. You know, a lot of us know about the history uh from between uh you know uh you know uh uh the there was really going west there wasn't a whole lot of trails that was made. There was a lot of explorations that had been done. And there was there was people that had made it over there to come back and to tell everybody about, you know, the the greatness of what was over there, about the lush farmlands that were west of the Colorado Rockies, you know, that was there to tell people, you know, of of all the timber and all of the unclaimed all of the unclaimed land and all of the all of those kinds of things that, you know, that were uh that were out there, you know, and and it was in 1839. It was the first uh uh train wagon, you know, or of immigrants anyways, of people from the eastern part of the United States that had worked their way west. And it was a it was a 2,170 mile trail that that was cut from uh all uh all the way from the east to the west to the Rockies. And and it wasn't an easy thing. There was a lot of a lot of things that they encountered. you know, there was a lack of water or there was a lack of food, you know, there or there was a lot of obstacles, rocky pathways and different things and but yet they still pressed on. And you know, I begin to think about uh you know, we even here in Oklahoma, we have the land run there in 1889 where you know, there was uh I guess an estimated amount of like 50,000 people that had showed up to come to do the to do the land run and and a lot of them were uh a lot of them were after, you know, new opportunities. a lot of a lot of land that um hadn't been claimed. A lot of uh just a lot of things that were that that they could people could go out and and try to start a new beginning or or to do better for themselves. And it was approximately 2 million square miles that 50,000 people were just going out and going out and staking claims and and and you know this section was this and this section was that and and I can't remember how many days or hours it said that it took for all the land to just get gobbled up and but yet uh you know all of this was just a journey. All of it was a uh is a story that we tell about. And you know, I was thinking about, of course, where brother Harry was talking about the pilgrims and and about how that when the the pilgrims, they they were being persecuted religiously for their beliefs because they were Puritans and about how that uh you know, uh they they had gotten they had they had gotten about the the Mayflower and the Speed Well, and you know, and they had desired because they had heard about a new land and they had heard about the opportunity and and the and the place where they can go and and they can worship freely and they can come to a place where uh uh they didn't have the taxes of Britain. They weren't under the rule of Britain. They weren't under the rule and and being persecuted religiously for what they believed and and they could go to this new place. So this was something that that intrigued this group of people in order in order to go to to this place and and you know again there was still a lot of hardships that took place as our brother had talked about. You know, there was, you know, there was, you know, there was food again. There was water. You know, there was there was disease, there was sickness, there was a lot of different things that that that had uh uh come on their way. They had to they had a problem. I believe he said that it was supposed to take 33 days, but yet it took 66 days in order to get there, you know. So, in in order in order for this journey to go on, there was a there was some perseverance that kind of really had to take place. It was more than just the person that was driving the boat that had to see the vision that was really going on, but it was everybody that was aboard that had to be able to see the vision in a broader spectrum. And and I begin to think about this and I and you know and I begin to think about how that you know uh I can't I can't uh help but to you know to but to try to to put a lot of my thought process through a filter you know and and you know and I try to take that filter and I I I take that and I just begin to kind of move some of this through through God's word and and I can't help but to to bring up you know the story of Israel and a lot of us we we all know who Israel is and we all know that that Israel had the had their have had you A lot of things that they did was just all put on paper, you know? I mean, how would you like it in your life? Everything that you did, brother Donald, was put on paper and it was just put in front of the people for everybody to see, you know? I mean, a lot of us would wouldn't appreciate that. But yet, God did these things for a reason. And I can't help for the fact that, you know, that that God would would save would save a prophet from being from being killed from, you know, from the children from two years and under, you know, that that Pharaoh would come and he would put a decree out and and he would and he would he would come and he would say that we need to kill all the children that are two years and two years and younger and and and and and you know, then and so the mother puts this this baby inside of a inside of a river somewhere, you know, and she just goes goes out there and we know the story about how that she prayed and how she pitched it and she done these different things and and you know and Moses just floats along just goes inside of uh goes inside of Pharaoh's courts there and just gets picked up and and by by the child or by by the by the by the the mother or the daughter there, you know, and and she and she makes him part of the kingdom. And I just don't see how how God would save his life and then put him in a situation to lead to lead a people without there being some type of purpose. And and the thing that really strikes my mind is when the scripture goes about and it talks about the the uh it goes and it talks about there and in in Psalms 37 and 23 and and this is the first scripture that kind of come to my mind and thinking about this about how that the scripture says that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delightth in his way. So, I don't feel like I don't feel like Moses just was stumbling upon these things, but God was using Moses's footsteps to to be able to document something in a bigger spectrum, in a in a bigger light. They were going through something that they were going through something. They were typing out or they were they were doing something that we could see. And and now we a lot of us know the story and if you don't, I'm not going to just go into the story and, you know, for detail. We're just going to kind of, you know, do like what you do on a jet ski on water. We're just going to, you know, we're just going to kind of, you know, just bounce across a little bit of the story here. And and you know, but Israel, Israel was was uh in a situation, you know, they were in goan. You we know the story about how that they were brought into Israel due to the or brought into Egypt to due to the famine. They were put in goan, but yet Israel began to Israel began to adapt to their surroundings. Israel begin to not be not just be separated Israel, but yet they begin to adapt to the surroundings and they begin to become a part of a part of Egypt and they begin to no doubt take on Egyptian things and take on Egyptian customs and do do these other do do these things and and you know what and and we know the story about how that how that God the thing about Israel is that God had already promised Israel to not be in Egypt. But he would they were promised another land and it was the scripture that we read that that he had that they were going to souljourn into a land for 400 years and that and that and but yet that he had a land that he was going to take them to that this land that it flowed with milk and honey. Now I want you to notice something that he was giving them somebody else's land. &gt;&gt; What a bust, right? You know you got some land and God's just going to give it away, right? you know, he said this is the land of the Hittites and the Parizzites and the the Jebusites and all these different itites that were out there, you know, and he but he said that that that he was going to give them a land that was flowing with milk and honey and Israel began to adapt to the place that that that they were at. But Moses meanwhile was called out and he we know the story. He was in Egypt. And God began to deal with Moses because Israel wasn't meant to stay in Egypt all of their life. But because Israel was a called people, Israel Israel had a promise that was written over their life. And so God through in his in his the the prophetic wheels of God's timing begin to click. And God had his man in the right place. He put him out. He took him from sleeping in the king's chambers to sleeping with goats and sheep and and and he had a and he and he had a woman that just, you know, that that that that they had his number, you know, and and you know what, he couldn't really just order her around so to, you know, too very much, you know, but but he put him into this position to where now God's wheels are beginning to move and and now God was beginning to go and he was going to go after the promised seed that that he had already put in inside of his word. And so he be to move onto Moses and he be to send him down into Egypt and and he be to come down and he be to God heard the cries of the task masters that was being placed upon Egypt and God was coming to pull them out of Egypt. And so he come down there and we know the story and he'd come down to Pharaoh and he was like Pharaoh and you know I want you to you let my people go. And Pharaoh was like, "Nope, ain't happening. Ain't not a not a not a fat chance." You know, because Israel had come to the point where they were they were building their pyramids. They were they they were putting money in their treasury. I mean, they were they were they were their they they were they were craftsmen. They were just they were just expendable pieces of property, but yet at the same time, they needed them in order to build their empire. And they was like, "Nope, ain't having it." But he didn't realize, Pharaoh didn't realize that they were a called out people. And it didn't matter. Amen. They didn't matter the strength that Pharaoh had. It didn't matter the ability that Pharaoh had to be able to keep Israel in his grips. They were going to leave Egypt. And we know the story about how God come down miraculously with with 10 different plagues. And he come down and he he turned, you know, the water into blood. He brought fl he brought frogs and he brought flies and he brought he brought all these different things that had come and then simply or or or when he come and then he had brought death and it was the final straw and Israel or are or or um Egypt let Israel go you know and so and I as again I'm trying to just breeze through this because I'm trying to get to a point but but you know Israel or Egypt when it finally got to the point where it had let Egypt go you know and and and and and 10 10 plagues had come, you know, and God gave God sent death to destroy all of the firstborn, but but yet he sent the blood to Israel to be able to put on the doorpost for protection. And finally, Pharaoh was like, you know, let them all go. Just just get out of my hair, get out of my way. You know, you would think that you would think that at that moment that it would just be peaches that it would just be like, you know what, God did this, but you know, God brought, you know, down frogs and flies and and fire and and turned water into blood, you know, and you would just think that from that point on that God would begin to pave the way and God would just be coming like, you know, with with trumpets, like these are my people and and I'm just going to march them into here and we're going to roll out the red carpet and we're just going to do these things. But yet they didn't realize that the journey with God had just begun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So they get out into the middle of a desert somewhere and they get pinned up. We know the story. They get pinned up at the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; GOD SAVES them at the Red Sea. We we we can look here into the scriptures. We can look here and we can see here in in in some of the scriptures where where it goes on and and we see where now Israel's on the journey and and and God comes in and delivers a wind for them and and and they're on their way and there's all kinds of murmuring that takes place and and you know what it's hot that's it's hot on the journey. &gt;&gt; It stinks. Think of all the cattle that's there and and you're walking behind a whole bunch of sheep. You're walking behind a whole bunch of cattle and you're walking behind a whole bunch of horses and you're walking by, you know what? This ain't this just this ain't the grand journey that it's supposed to be. I mean, these are the children of Israel. These are the ones that have just been up have just uprooted the greatest nation of the world and we're walking in dung. &gt;&gt; I mean, we're we're we're out here in the middle of the desert. We ain't got no water. We ain't got no food. I mean, we I mean I mean I mean it stinks out here. I mean, we get backed up to a Red Sea. We almost lose our life. And God comes out, miraculously, opens up the Red Sea, and now look at us. I mean, we're stuck out here and we ain't got none of these things. You know what? But but what he was trying to do was he was trying to show them to depend solely upon them. Because you think about this that the whole time that they're murdering, they're like, "Oh, you brought us out here that all of us that are going to die of thirst. Oh, you brought us all the way out here that all of us that we're going to die with hunger. It would it would have been better for been better for us to be back in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Oh, you know what? You you brought us out. Think about this. I mean, they're they're crying about bread and now they want meat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they're like, Moses, IF IF WE DON'T GOT MEAT, it would have been better FOR US TO JUST DIE BACK WITH TO THE EGYPTIANS. AND GOD'S LIKE, I'LL GIVE YOU ONE BETTER. I'm going to give you mana. &gt;&gt; He gives us mana. And he's like, "Oh, GOD, WE'RE GOING TO DIE OF THIRST." AND GOD'S LIKE, and then he goes and splits a rock and brings water out of brings water out water OUT OF THE ROCK. HE EVERY SITUATION that they go through, God provides for them every time throughout the journey. Hey, man. They need water. GOD GOD BRINGS WATER OUT OF A ROCK. HOW MANY of you have you ever DRUNK OUT OF A rock here lately? They're just like, "Oh, I'm thirsty." And you just pick up a rock out of the dirt, out of the dirt, and you're just like, "Oh, thank you so much." Careful. Open your mouth. You're going to get a big dirt cloth. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, they walk out and they're walking out in the forest and the scripture says that they notice these little white things down on the ground. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they interpreted it as mana. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You walk out and How many of you have ever SAT DOWN AND ATE GOD'S FOOD BEFORE? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Sat down and ate angel food. What Israel did? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Israel had come to this point that and every time that they had need of something in their life and they were going through THIS JOURNEY. AMEN. GOD MET FOR THEM TIME and time. He was like SO THAT YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; SO that they know so that every everybody THAT CAN COMES AND TELLS this story will be ABLE TO SAY THAT I WAS THE GREAT ONE THAT I PROVIDED FOR YOUR NEED IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDERNESS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO, they're trottting along through life and they start getting bit by serpents. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For the things that they done &gt;&gt; and God graciously comes OUT AND BRINGS OUT THE brazen serpent. &gt;&gt; He comes out and God's providing for them as they come through the through this desert land. But then they come TO A POINT, A place &gt;&gt; called Kanesh Barnea. They come to this place and now now they they've come to they've come to there and they're just right there to the point where they're about to cross over into this promised land. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They're about to cross over into this place to where WHERE WHERE EVERYTHING THAT GOD'S TALKED ABOUT IN THEIR PROMISES, everything that he said that it would be, everything that they were holding out for, everything that everything that they were going to uh put inside of their minds was over in this other place. AND THEY SIT 10 men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. 10 men goes over there and they come back and they're like, "It flows with milk and honey." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look at these grapes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, look at these grapes. It's everything God says that it would be. It's everything that he said. Everything in in the scripture is true. Everything that he had told Abraham, everything that he told the fathers, they said they're true. But &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; we've seen the children of Anchen or Anan in there. I think it's Anan. &gt;&gt; Anoch or you know who I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Those guys, the real the giant ones &gt;&gt; because the scripture says we look like grasshoppers in their sight. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, they begin to preach lies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It said the walls are are are great. &gt;&gt; The men are strong. He says, "I I don't know if there were that if we're able to take the city or not. We can go back. We can go on down into the scriptures." You know, we go on down in the scriptures and you could see where where he goes down and he and they talk about how that we're grasshoppers in their sight. The scripture goes on and and God says, "I'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS IN the wilderness." YEAH. &gt;&gt; I'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS IN THE DESERT. I provided for them when they when when they had need to eat. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; I PROVIDED FOR THEM. You know, I I I BROUGHT ALL THESE THINGS AND YOU'VE DONE THESE ALL THESE THINGS TO TEMPT ME NOW. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; OKAY. He says at this point, he's like, "THERE'LL BE NOT NONE OF YOU GO go into this go into this new land except for my servants Joshua and Caleb." &gt;&gt; All right. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like to stop right there. Just pause the story for a minute because you know what? God used Israel's life as a timeline. He used Israel as a as a reflection for us to be able to reflect in our own life, you know. And the thing is is it's not something that I could just look back and say my with my own wisdom and be able to come back and be like, "Oh, this is what this is what this really means. Israel's life is is you know what?" But all scripture now we can go back and we can find here in the scripture there in 2 Peter 1:20 it says knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture of his is of any private interpretation. &gt;&gt; So there's nothing about Israel that's that's that's that's or the stories or what or what Israel to type out is any of my private interpretation. First, the scripture says there in Amos 3:7, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets." &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; So, there's nothing there's nothing there's nothing about Israel that's to be revealed that the prophet hasn't already revealed. So, now I begin to look at this at the process of Israel. Now, Israel was in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Which is a good which would be a good type of the world. Israel. It was at the height of modern fashion. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Israel's armies were were the greatest of the of the world. It conquered the known world. &gt;&gt; It had knowledge. It had it had science. It had it had a a lot of things that the world looked at, you know, for to to be able to to to enhance their ability to survive. The prophet goes on and be able and says these and says this. It says, "Now they journeyied." Now they journeyed. Beautiful picture coming up out of the chaos of Egypt and out of the garlics of the pots of the world. Crossing the Red Sea, leaving the things behind, cutting loose the sh the at the shoreline as we call it today. Coming up to walk in a strange land among the strange people, serving the Lord. What a type of the conversion. leaving Egypt, sandy, barren lands to sojurnn in a wilderness among a strange people. But a promise that God would take you through. God's promise tonight when you come up out of the world and you separate yourself from all of your earthly associates and all the parties you used to go through and the worldly amusements and the drinking and the smoking and the gambling and all these things that are separated. And you're walking among strange people that you haven't known before. They say amen. And the spiritfilled believing in all things, hoping all things, waiting for the coming of the Lord, professing to be a pilgrim and a stranger, nothing of this world, don't desire it. FA are falling away from the things of this world. See what I mean? See what I'm saying? Israel being a type of the world, the world that we come out of, the world that we were stuck in and we were fashioned in and we were fashioned after. Amen. We desire the things of the world. Amen. We desire to be people of the world. We desire to have their things and and we and but yet God through the word and a promised people, God sent a prophet to the world to be able to call OUT A PEOPLE BECAUSE THOSE people that were in the world that were in that land had been promised to go to another land that was flowing with milk and honey. Amen. And today, GOD IS STILL CALLING AND HAS CALLED PEOPLE OUT OF THIS world that we live in, this Egypt, this world. HE'S CALLING THEM OUT BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROMISE TO go into. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Egypt. Amen. Those the children of Israel, they begin to move out of Egypt and they begin to go onto this journey. And again, the prophet makes mention makes mention of this again. And he says, "Oh, I've got to stop here and say something just a moment. Now again, they're journeying to the promised land. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, I got to stop here on something. Just a moment. Won't take me but a minute. Many people have to uh refer to the promised land to the millennium." It's not. The promised land had wars and killings. The millennium won't have wars or killings. It's referred to the Holy Spirit, the battlegrounds, justification. They left Egypt. There's three stages to their journey. They left Egypt under justification believing the word. They separated themselves from the Egyptians and yet they came out. They crossed the Red Sea and they kill the things behind them which were sanctification through the blood that kills all human desire of eagle evil. Second stage of the journey. But the third stage was uh was when they crossed Jordan into the promised land where their inheritance land their inheritance never laid in Egypt though God blessed them in Egypt. So in other words, they're coming you come out of this world and now you're moving through justification. Amen. You've been called out by a prophet and you're on this journey and and through just injustification and through sanctification. ALONG THIS JOURNEY. GOD BLESSED you while you were on your journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; God blesses you while you're on your journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While you're going through your drama, saying things you ain't supposed to be saying, doing things that you ain't supposed to be doing. Amen. GOD GOD CALLED YOU OUT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO be here because THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU THAT GOD'S CHOSE YOU FOR SERVICE. WE CAN GO BACK TO THE story about the cup of the cup that was laying in the ground and how that it was selected first &gt;&gt; then it was cleansed and it was put into service. &gt;&gt; Okay. God had selected you out of the world before the foundation of the world. GOD HAD SELECTED YOU. That's why when church came across your being, when God began to shine and hover the light over your soul, it contacted you. It be it magnetized to your heart something different than your neighbor did cuz they could care less &gt;&gt; because they weren't chosen. They weren't predestinated. God didn't call them. And so you're on your journey knowing that you're supposed to be here for some reason. And now you're in a place in a situation, a state of just a sanctification where God is cleansing you up. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; GOD'S SCRAPING ALL THESE THINGS AWAY. You might have a little bit of hatred that you have to deal with. So he sends brother Donald your way. &gt;&gt; There might be something that you have to deal with &gt;&gt; and that individual. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; HAS GOT THE RIGHT FINGER TO BE ABLE TO PUSH your buttons. &gt;&gt; All right. And you don't know how, but God puts YOU TWO IN THE same church. OUT OF ALL THE CHURCHES IN THE UNITED STATES TO GO TO, God puts you two in the same church because you guys have the selected fingers to touch each other's buttons to be able to pull these things up in your life THAT YOU NEED SOME SANCTIFYING IN, &gt;&gt; some some shoring UP IN. AND GOD AND AND GOD he &gt;&gt; that's why God gives you a pastor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Comes to give you up and shore you up. Make sure you're sanctified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. How many you love your pastor? Amen. But they come through this stage and they'd come through sanctification. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and they come to a place where God was honing them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he was letting them go through every situation in their life and the stage of their journey so they can see that they didn't need the world cuz they kept going back to the world. Kept going back to the world. Kept going back to their old way of life. Kept going back to the way they used to do things. Kept going back to the old way that they made money. Kept going back to this. Kept going back to that. But yet God was like, "No, I'm going to cut them off. In fact, I'M GOING TO DROWN EVERY one of them." &gt;&gt; All right. I'm going to kill every last one of them. You talk about burning the bridge, God's like, I will wipe out a continent. &gt;&gt; I will wipe out a civilization. I will make it as if the only things that that will be left in their civilization is hieroglyphics. &gt;&gt; I will completely obliterate them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; From history in order for you to lean upon me. &gt;&gt; All right. So he said that they that they might know he provided water. They that's how you how you think that you got your rent paid. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It wasn't because your drinking buddy paid your bills. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It wasn't because your smoking buddy was paying your bills. It wasn't because your running buddies was running around was paying your bills. IT'S BECAUSE GOD has selected you for a purpose and he has a designed He has a designed plan for your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he begins to cut these things off. He begins and he provided for Israel because he blessed them ALONG THE JOURNEY BUT that wasn't the place that they were meant to be. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Though they come to certain places in their experience like when water came up out of the rock. &gt;&gt; Sure. or when God would bless a certain area, you would hear in the scriptures and it would talk about how that some stayed, how that some encamped and stuff play. You can't just stay around God's blessings. You got to become part of them. Okay. &gt;&gt; So they come and they come to this place where they come through sanctification but yet they come to this place called Kanesh Barnea where God had come to this place where now they had now they had sent the spies over and the and the spies had come back and God HAS BEEN HAD SAT there and he was just like he was just like YOU KNOW I'M I AM WROTH THAT I HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS AND YOU STILL DON'T TRUST ME. &gt;&gt; YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE THAT I CAN PAY YOUR BILLS. YEAH. &gt;&gt; YOU STILL DON'T believe that I can that I can heal you of your body. It doesn't matter. Amen. That if it's in your toe, it doesn't matter if it's in your knee. Doesn't matter if it's in your legs, eyes, earlobes. Amen. You might have a you might be losing your hair. Doesn't matter what IT IS. THEY STILL DON'T BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I DON'T EVEN WANT THEM COMING INTO THE PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; LET THEM JUST STAY HERE AND EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM DIE. &gt;&gt; UHOH. EVERY LAST one of them. &gt;&gt; You could sit here and you could talk about every blessing that you've been through. You could sit here and you could talk about how you could talk about how you know that I I was in this movement or I was part of this back in 19 whatever or this and that. BUT WHEN YOU COME TO THAT PLACE, when you come to that KANES BARNEY WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE AN ABSOLUTE BASED DECISION OFF OF WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU INTO THE PAST OR THE FEELINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW, AMEN. YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL BECAUSE GOD WILL MAKE HIS DECISIONS TOO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And he SAYS THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM THAT HAVE DENIED ME after what I've did, I want you to go back to the forest by the Red Sea. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to possess the land. You're not going to possess the land. &gt;&gt; You're not going to possess the land with a church mentality that you're just along for the ride. That you're just going to be here because you know what, brother so and so and sister so and so's here and and I'm just going to I'm just going to float it along these things and oh, I was a part of this when this happened and oh, I was a part of this when that happened. But when the moment come that they had to make a conscientious decision themselves, Amen. They busted, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; Fell apart. &gt;&gt; Fell apart after God done all these things. You listen to it. Read it. Read read ex read Exodus. &gt;&gt; Read Leviticus. &gt;&gt; Just crying. Just a whole bunch of crying around that's going on in the church. There a whole bunch of it. Just just blah blah blah going on. all that that that that's going on. But I don't want to leave you there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if there's a part of you that's like, you know, that's not me, you're right. &gt;&gt; That's not you. Because you know what? The scriptures the scripture goes on right at the end of that after after God goes on and he says, "You know what? Not a one of you is going to make it." I mean, every one of you, I want you to go back and I want you to just go basically just want you to go die. What he said, just go die. Numbers 14:24, he says, "But my servant Caleb." Oh, this is your way out. This is your way out. He says, "But my servant Caleb," because he had another spirit &gt;&gt; within him, and he followed me fully. Him will I bring unto the land, wherein he went, and his seed s shall possess us. Now, if you look and you go read the verses that was before it, the other eight of those men had went out and they gave an evil report. But Caleb had come out and he Caleb and Joshua, they were like, "Wait a minute." But don't you think that if God had done this and if God had done that and if God had done these things and God had done all these other things that he would that he would that he would uh that he would come and he would deliver us, amen, from these giants and he would come and he would deliver US FROM THESE. NOW, THAT IS WHAT YOUR TYPE is here this evening. It's the believer, amen, that solely stands upon the WORD OF GOD REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AMEN. And you come to that place where you can fully rest. Now, I'd like to bring this I'd like to bring this here. This this little quote, this little quote here. It says it says, "They are like the children of Israel who came up out of Egypt and stopped short of the promised land." Now those children of Israel left Egypt about 2 million strong and THEY JOURNEYED TOGETHER. ALL SAW the mira the same miracles of God. All part par part par part par part par part par part par part par part par part par part par parttook of the same mana from the water from the smitten rock and followed the same cloud by day and the pillar of power of uh the pillar of fire by night. But only two reached the promised land. Only two were the real believers. That is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of their unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter in. Hebrews 13 3 and 19 this uh then since that is is so the only two entered then the rest were not true believers. What made the difference? Two stayed with the word. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Two stayed with the word. When the hearts of the 10 spies failed for the kanes barneas, two stayed with the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You staying with the word against the doctor's report regardless of how many MILLIONS OF DOCTORS MEDICAL science reports have come back. You stand with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Okay? Two stayed with the word. And when the hearts of the 10 spies failed at Kanis Barnea, Joshua and Caleb did not stagger. For they believed the word and said, "We are more than able to take the land." They knew they could because God had said, "I have given you the land." After all the Israelites saw the power and the goodness and he and he and delivered and deliverance of God, they did not enter into rest. &gt;&gt; Okay. After what WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE DELIVERANCES? What was the purpose of God manifesting himself singly one on-one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; One on-one with Israel. No if ends or buts ABOUT IT. IT WAS THEM GOD. IT WAS SO that he could put he could put their minds solely TO REST THAT GOD WOULD PROVIDE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; After all those saw the power and the goodness and the deliverance of God, they did not enter into rest, which is a type of the Holy Ghost. What was the type of the Holy Ghost? And it wasn't it wasn't or what was the type of what was a type of the promised land? The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They entered into rest. They did not enter into the rest of the Holy Ghost. The full surrender. Amen. that God would be able to provide for their needs. Therefore, God turned them around. AMEN. AND BASICALLY TRY AGAIN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stood up to the border. Are we at the border of Arcanes Barney here this evening? Amen. Where we come to the point where we have to be able to look at the true facts of what God has done in the day that we live in. Not only in the past in the prophets's age, but but every miracle that we could go down go down every row in this service. We could GO WHERE JOE SANDERS where his boy was healed as a young as a young boy. Amen. We prayed for in the church and got healed. Amen. That young boy and he's alive here today. Amen. We got our we got our sister Katrina. She had problems with her arms. Amen. And God healed her arm. Amen. In the middle of the service. Amen. We got our other uh where it was with Annne Martin where God put a socket back in the hip. Amen. Of that young girl. We've got Sister Carol where she was healed of cancer IN HER BODY. WE'VE GOT JOE AND STEPHANIE where the liver was brought back and God delivered. Amen. His his life. AMEN. AND HE'S SERVING GOD HERE TODAY. ARE WE GOING TO WALK UP TO THE KANES BARNEA OF OUR LIFE? AND ARE WE GOING TO DENY THE WORKS OF GOD? AMEN. ARE WE GOING TO ENTER INTO THE PROMISED LAND OF the Holy Ghost and THE ASSURANCE AND THE REST, AMEN, that God has for us? The land is yours. IT'S BEEN PROMISED BY GOD. AMEN. YOU'VE BEEN PREDESTINATED AND YOU HAVE A PLACE AND YOU HAVE A PURPOSE. AMEN. You just got to walk into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, it was a different it was a different ballgame. You know what? There there comes a time, amen, where all those old unbelievers, they died off. You know, there comes a time where all those old warriors, they died off. And there was a new crop, but there was a new generation of warriors that what that had that had rose up and you know what? But the old warriors, oh Joshua and Caleb, though they were old in their life and though they had gone through certain things in their life, Amen. They were still just as able, they said, in the time they were 80 years old to be able to take the mountain as they was when the promise was first given. Amen. And you might be marching in the land. You might be sitting here. Amen. You you might stepped over from Kanes Barney and you're into your promised land. Now remember, I ain't preaching flowers. I ain't preaching free cell phone and a and a and a 32 ounce from Quick Trip. &gt;&gt; God's God's GOD'S GOING TO STILL MAKE YOU GO THROUGH THINGS BECAUSE THERE WAS FIGHTING THAT was going on in the promised land. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; There was fighting that was going on. They didn't cross over into the promised land. You didn't get filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, I've arrived &gt;&gt; again." Yeah. &gt;&gt; You just now found out who you are. &gt;&gt; You've just now found out THAT EVERYTHING THAT GOD'S BEEN TRAINING me in the desert to believe on him and to lean on him. Amen. Now that I've entered into a full rest, but but you don't desire the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because the things that are the things that were in the desert on the journey, those things are to stay there. all the fashion and all your all your lust for money and all your desire to be like the next person and and all your desires, your ambitions and those things that that if it's contrary to the word of God. Amen. That's not in God's plan. Amen. You just pass through the land of this world. Amen. And you get by with just the things that you just the things that you need in this world. Of course, you need some shoes and you need a jacket and please get a haircut. You're going to need those things. But this is just a wilderness that we're passing through. God's given you a promised land. Amen. And if you're abiding in the word, if you're FILLED WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE Holy Ghost, Amen. And you abide in the word and CHRIST THE WORD ABIDES IN YOU. AMEN. Then you're entitled TO EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THE PROMISED LAND. AMEN. AMEN. There might be disease that you're standing against. That might be a Hittite. &gt;&gt; Okay? You might be looking at financial situations in your life that might be a Jebusite. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might be looking at family troubles in your sight and in your life that MIGHT BE A PARASITE. BUT THE THING WAS IS GOD HAS ALREADY GIVEN UP THEIR LAND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. And that HEALTH IS YOURS AND FINANCES YOURS IS YOURS. AMEN. AND FAMILY IS YOURS AND EVERYTHING THAT LIVES INSIDE THAT LAND IS YOURS. AMEN. IT'S BEEN PROMISED TO YOU. &gt;&gt; I believe. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I like this right here. And he says, "My now, it's your job to figure it out how I look at it in my life. I'm 36 years old, you know, and tell him how much more longer I got. I'm going to acquire things as I go. And I'm gonna acquire these things, you know, and Lord willing, it's going to be left to my children. and I ain't going to have time to just sit there and just be able to point out every little thing that I have. They're going to have to find it out themselves, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They're just going to have to go into the think tank there at 550 Illinois and just try to figure out what I was doing here and what I was doing here, what this tool's used for and what that tool's used for and is that even a tool, you know, or or you know, he's going to figure out all these things. It's their job to be able to go through and to discover and to be able to find these things. what I've been doing these past several years and or lot you know past long time been doing these things and and you know it's your job to get into the scripture and it's your job to get into the Bible and it's your job to be able to get into the messages of the hour and to be able to find out what's in your promised land it's your job to be able to go out the prophet says this it says my could you buy a house without looking through it not going to happen in my house ain't a ain't going to happen could you buy a house and and you go look and not do anything or and not go go without looking through it. It says if I own anything, I want to look around. You know, the Holy Ghost is like a big arcade. You know that what an arcade is? It's you know what an arcade is and you're baptized into it. Now, if I own an arcade, I want to go and to the shelf and to see what I own. Look around. Look at this. I if something seems to be a little high, get me a ladder and climb up to it and look around to see what belongs to me. And that's the way you ought to do as a Christian. Look through the Bible and see what the promise is. Every one of them is to the believer. Amen. Remember when we used to sing the song way before or way before we backslide. Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter and every verse and every line is trusting in his love divine. Every promise in the book is mine. And that's exactly where we are here today in the word that we have here. Here here is we've been given the word by God. He's called us out and he's marching us into the promised land of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And that land is yours as much as you want to believe it. Amen. If you want to stand up and you want to look over every last inch of it of it. Amen. You can. You can take the word of God. Amen. It's your inheritance. It's your inheritance to be able to look, amen, at God's word and be able to say, you know what, Father, I'm going to take what's mine, Amen. Doesn't matter how old I am. It doesn't matter how inexperienced it seems that that it seems that I am, but God, I'm taking your word because I abide in your word and your word abides in me. Lord, lead me to the promise and let me take my land. Amen. &gt;&gt; As our musicians come, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. And you know, I I think here that Israel's life has always been a great blessing to me because it God uses these things and not only just having the words on page of Israel's life, but having the light of the message that we have to be able to come and be able to see why God put these things through, put Israel through through these things so we could see in our life why God puts us through things to be able to see the plan of God. And here this evening, you might be staring at a giant. You might be looking at a walled city. You might be lacking some things in your experience. But don't fear. God's already promised you your land. And you could take God's promise and you can live below your means. But brother, I'd rather take God's word and be able to say, "You know what, Lord? Let that be your will for my life." &gt;&gt; Every word that's preached by the ministers, every song that's sung, Lord, let that be my life. Let me not stand at that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of what I think, I deny your word. Maybe God might be moving upon you to use you in a greater light in ministry or be able to use you in a greater light of your family. That's your promise. Israel went into a lot of different places in the promised land and there was a lot of walled cities, giants, and just it seemed to be just unbelievable odds against them. But yet God came down time and time again and proved himself real. And every one of us can go to situations that's been that we've been surrounded by miracles and things that's been done in people's life and we could sit back and we could say, "God was real here. God was real there. Now it's time to take that thing and be able to look at it. Maybe God's trying to show me something. Maybe I've gone through this entire life and I've seen all these things to be able to see these things because you know what? I'm to take them and apply them to my life. My healing is not only just for me, but it's to show you that he's real. God, your testimony in your life is not just for you, but for your neighbors to show them that they're real or that he's real. &gt;&gt; Amen. Through it all, &gt;&gt; I've learned to trust in Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I learned to trust in God &gt;&gt; through it all. Through it all, I learned to depend upon his word. &gt;&gt; I have many tears of sorrows. &gt;&gt; I've had questions for tomorrow. Many times I didn't know right from wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes. But in every situation, &gt;&gt; God gave blessing consolation that my trials come to make sure. &gt;&gt; Oh, through it all. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. I've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces. There were times I felt so all alone. But in my lonely hours, yes, those precious lonely hours, Jesus let me know I'm still his own. Oh, through it all. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. So I thank God for the mountains and I thank him for the valleyies and I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. Or if I've never had a problem, I wouldn't know that he could solve it. I wouldn't know what faith in God will do. Oh, through it all. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Amen. I'd like to just finish up maybe with this one quote here and we were talking about how Joshua and Caleb had went over into the promised land and now how that they went over and they'd come back with the evidence. Brother Brandham says this. He says just like Joshua and Caleb brought back the evidence of the unseen land that had been given to the people by a promise. Joshua and Caleb brought back an evidence that there was such a land. Now down there they had the promise of it. God gave them the promise and they came right back up to the land, but they had never seen it. And Joshua and Caleb had went over into the promised land and brought back the evidence that the land was there and it was a good place flowing with milk and honey. Amen. There, what was it? They were going to possess the land. They had the promise that was on their road over there and they were almost to Jordan and Joshua crossed over and brought back the evidence that it was a good land just what Joshua did for the children of Israel. Joshua means savior. The word Joshua and that's the same thing Jesus done for the church when they killed him. He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered the grave. And he rose up again with the evidence, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That was the evidence, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that there is a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever. Amen. He come back and brought us the evidence. What does it do, brother Brandham? Makes you stop your lying, stealing, drinking, cussing, immoral, everything, and makes you a new creation out of you. I who were once dead in trespasses, nevertheless I live. Not me, but Christ lives in me. I'm a new creature creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. Heir to his promise. Hallelujah. That land belongs to us. How do you know it? Joshua rose from Joshua rose from the dead, brought back the or Joshua rose up, brought back the evidence, the Holy Ghost. I got it. Amen. Glory. I'm an heir. The child of the king. a child of the king to all things. The Bible says so. Amen. God bless you here this evening. So, we turn it over to our pastor. Amen. Through it all. Through it all. I've learned to trust in Jesus. I learned to trust in God. Through it all, for through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Amen. I like that song. That was a song mom, dad sung for so many, many years. And I've I've seen that witness in their lives. And and u I uh I've seen it in my life as well. The older the older a guy gets, the more he looks back at the faithfulness of the Lord. And as brother Michael was saying, you've got your stages in your life. You've got justification, and that's that's a wonderful stage. That's that's and you never you never outgrow justification. But you've got to move on to sanctification and you've got to be a live a he's got to work through your life. And that and and that's that's one of the reasons I you know I've uh I've always loved uh new converts loved young people. And you go through those stages and and God will put you in in in areas of your life to where it's not comfortable. And and as a young person, lots of times you think that maybe you're not a Christian or maybe it's not you're not cut out for the job. We we talk about God choosing so much and you think I must have been the guy that he hasn't chosen. Well, his call is for whosoever will. And the fact is, if there's something in your heart that that is saying, I love the Lord and I I'm I'm really in a grind right now. I'm in a my my spirit's messed up. My I'm struggling with with Maybe it might be a lie lying. Maybe you you're you're fighting a lying devil. Maybe you're fighting a I I you know what whatever devil I you know and uh you know and you'll hear these kind of messages of overcoming and fighting your fight. And and that's what you're supposed to do. That's what these messages are for is to put a put a little bit of grit in your in your belly. a little little something to make you stand up and say, you know, this is worth fighting for. This is who I am. You know, you might have messed up this morning, but I'm up right now and I'm going to fight. And five minutes later, you might be back down on the ground again. Get back up. &gt;&gt; Keep that sword up. &gt;&gt; Keep blood on your sword. &gt;&gt; Keep on fighting. Yeah, you might be gushing blood, too. Amen. But that's all right. Get up. &gt;&gt; I I love the fact that, you know, there's no reports. There's there's no reports that there was even a Red Cross followed the those guys when they entered into the promised land. And yet, they were doing all of that fighting. In fact, when they did lose a couple of guys, I think they lost 17 guys if if I'm remembering right. and and JOSHUA STOPS THE WHOLE BATTLE, STOPS the whole campaign, retreats, and says, "All right, something's going on. We've got sin in the camp somewhere. We've got some rebellion going on against the word of the Lord." And then when they drew the lot, that's when they found Achen who was hiding a golden wedge and a and a garment and and uh and and and they they had to eradicate the sin. So, so I guess what I'm saying is the battle is very real. You can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and be fighting battles, &gt;&gt; but there ain't no winning and there ain't no coming out. Amen. Until you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you've got to have the Holy Ghost. It it's Pentecost today has made the Holy Ghost. You know, anointing is is something that you feel and and it and and and I love emotion. And when you get into the presence of God, you do feel it. But I'm telling you what, amen. I know the presence of God has been near me many of times. And and and I've not felt like running and dancing and speaking in tongues. That's right. The Holy Ghost is given to us as an assurance. As brother Michael was saying, arrest. There is a rest. I belong in this land. This word is mine. I will take my mountain. I will. I refuse to back down. And I don't care if you've been fighting that same old cottonpicking giant for the last three months. Keep on fighting that giant because he's on your land. That is your ground. That is your promise. You can have it. Amen. Amen. And I say that here today. And uh so I I give I you know I I've always given grace, a lot of grace to to to young people. Amen. And uh uh I want you young men and young women to know that that uh we're behind you 100%. We're we're we're behind you, man. I I I I Hallelujah. You ever need someone to listen to or or or or some someone to talk to, you do end up listening when you come to me. Amen. But uh uh but but but but you know, find a way to get a hold of me and and and you know, if we need to go get a malt or go get a shake or something. Amen. Or or or and and I believe that's the way it is for all these elders. I believe all of these men and women would listen to any of you. You you need you need someone to talk to. Uh don't fight your battle alone and don't feel like you're you're all alone. Amen. Because I'm telling you right now, there are some folks that's been in this been in this promised land for a while and they know some in-n-outs on fighting giants. Amen. And and uh uh you know you you you you got in trouble here, you get in trouble there. Listen to me. Listen to me. Amen. You're going to win. You're going to win. God's with us. Hallelujah. You know, growing up is tough. Growing up is tough. It's it's it's hard. It's hard being a teenager. Amen. Transitioning into a man or a woman and and a lot of emotions that goes in, a lot of things you don't quite see. And it takes a little while. Hey, listen. you know, you're you're trying to find who you are as a young person, as a man or a young woman, and you're also, amen, trying to find your position in Christ. And uh uh it it can be tough. It can be tough. But but uh I'm here to tell you right now, we're all winners. I made it well. And I guess the rest of us did, too. And so, Amen. Every one of you young men, every one of you young ladies, you just know that this preacher is not pointing any fingers cuz I can remember it's I can like yesterday the struggles I went through as a young man and the struggles I've gone through. Amen. Coming all the way up to where I'm at right now. The greatest thing, the greatest asset to anything in God is have a willing heart to admit when you're wrong and admit when when you need to be raw, be raw, man. Be raw. What I mean by raw is is just if you're confused, tell God about it. I I if if you're needing I mean talk to God. Let let go let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let let God know that you think he's real and then let God come back and talk to you. Amen. Well, there's a lot there's a lot of young men even, you know, there's a lot of young people that that that that struggle so hard in their mind trying to figure out. Amen. And it's it's it's good to have some elders that that says, "Hey, buddy been there. You're going to make it. You're going to make it." Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. For what's that worth? Amen. So, I I got to thinking about that when Brother Michael was was preaching along at lines because Amen. &gt;&gt; sanctification is a is a process. Baptism of the Holy Ghost is Amen. And it's not it's not a one time, you know, you know, I got the Holy Ghost. Now I'm now it's over with. Ha. You're just now getting started in the battle. You've just been equipped to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. So get the Holy Ghost. Amen. Get the Holy Ghost. And uh uh I think I think I think these situations in our lives are to are to really put us in a put us in a spot to we realize that we need God. Well, glory to God. You enjoy that message tonight. Amen. Amen. And uh so I I I tell you I I I love new converts and love young people. And uh I just want you to know I as as as pastor I I'm praying for you, believing for you, pulling for you. Amen. And if you ever fall, get back up. Hallelujah. And see, in Pentecost, we we uh we as preachers, we're always taught you never be around the people. And then always, I mean, you just got to you just got to look perfect. You can't you can't look like you're human because if you look human, people's going to lose the respect in you. And uh well, I lost the respect in them. Amen. with them guys trying to look superhuman and super spiritual and then uh couldn't admit that they were hallelujah but they had problems and and so we don't we don't want anyone around here looking like we ain't got problems we've all got problems and God's led us the way that he's led us because he wants us as Michael said he put it good rely on him. He wants us to rely on him. Is that right? Praise the Lord. Well, glory to God. So, I guess until we get on the other side, we're going to be humans. Amen. And and but we're going to have the we're going to have the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Amen. To do great feats. And they that know their God shall do great exploits. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know, I loved all the specials uh today, this morning, and tonight. Amen. Those were those were good specials. Did y'all enjoy those specials here this today? Amen. So, don't forget we're going to be doing Christmas carols.
