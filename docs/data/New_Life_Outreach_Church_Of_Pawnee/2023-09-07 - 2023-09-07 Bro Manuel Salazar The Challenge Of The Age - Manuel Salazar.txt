just I hate to keep you standing but I'm going to keep you standing just for sure brother Adam in a message called persevere he said everybody wants to be babied and petted he said that's the reason it makes hotbed plants have to be sprayed with goody goody this and goody goody that [Music] he said Christian Christianity is rugged Ryan somebody's saying rugged Christianity is rugged we don't need no spray so you're thinking and I was thinking too that I brought this for you I said I'm going to bring this over here in case you musicians don't get to play the part that you on or play the equipment or the songs here you go this is for this is for the audio well I gotta get stuck up there this is for the minister section and so I thought I was going to bring this out for you but little did I realize it was for me you know I I landed about I broke my leg and you know I was down for a little while and you know my wife had to take care of me and you know completely and you don't realize how important the body functions are you think brother brother Daryl you know with his back hurting you know you think of those who persevere and come in here no matter what the pain or what what's taking place and you know you start to feel a little bit down you start to feel a little bit or you know how brother Jewell would say woesy wowzy me well you know that was kind of me on the waist I don't know if I'm gonna make it I don't know my legs hurts I don't know about this and all my circumstances and all these things and I thought I brought this for you but [Music] you know little did I know is for me but you know how many throws tantrums in here okay I'm asking the the sisters now how many of your husbands throw little fits where I can't see your hands wow just a few of you [Music] man you you husbands in Oklahoma are good well back home you know I was throwing the fits and the Tantrums and you know all these things and you know we realized that we are our worst enemy ourselves and I've recognized this and you know it's too bad that you know sometimes we have to throw those fits and those tantrums and you know the Lord comes on the scene and he he shows you just exactly how you're acting and you know you say Lord forgive me Lord Lord forgive me for for those things and we would like to blame him on all you guys all this young people throwing fits but you know some as adults we we do too and so brother Brown said we just need to let loose and let God how many could just let loose tonight how am I just gonna let God take control and of course I'm speaking to myself this evening so that being said I'd like to turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 59. so probably the last year you'll see this bottle if you've been throwing any fits or or Tantrums you can come and wave goodbye to that tonight I said I don't need no goody goody spray I just need him [Applause] I just need him I I we all love to be petted and baby but you know at the end of the day you know it's not a flowery bed of ease Christianity is is rugged so that being said uh just appreciate all the ministers here just God bless you it's always a blessing you know to have all the ministers together here and be able to I I don't know how much longer that we'll be able to have meetings like these and so I I personally just just cherish them so so I pray that you just cherish them too Isaiah chapter 59 when you're there you could just say Amen of course we always love class participation so if you if you pay attention we might get out early Isaiah chapter 59 and we're going to read one verse uh there verse 19. when you're there you could just say Amen Isaiah 59 and 19. and the Bible says so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and His glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against who against who against him let us turn out to the Book of Malachi chapter 4. Malachi chapter 4 and when you're there you can say Amen Malachi chapter 4 we're going to start in verse 5. the Bible says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers least I come and smite the Earth with a curse one more scripture this evening we'll turn to Revelations chapter 10. Revelation chapter 10. when you're there to say Amen we're just going to read one verse in verse 7. and the Bible says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets let's just bow our heads dear and precious Heavenly Father Lord we come humbly before you this evening Lord God father you've been so wonderful to us Lord father we're so blessed by your mercy Lord God and Lord by your grace father Lord are our hearts Lord God just long tonight for more of thee father Lord we know we've come into an age it's a wicked age but Lord You've you've come Lord God in your word Lord God and Father we look out and we see your people Lord God and Father regardless of the circumstances they realize that they're blessed father and Lord we just pray tonight Lord as we've walked out of the the pastor's room back there father we have nothing to offer Lord except just stepping aside father here this evening Lord Lord we just ask Lord tonight Lord as we surrender everything that we are not only the speaker tonight Lord but the hearer father Lord that we would just leave the world and the problems behind father and Lord just open up our hearts to you and worship you in spirit and Truth father we pray Lord God a special blessing upon this congregation Lord upon this church upon its Pastor Lord God father be with him Lord God as you have been Lord and we pray Lord God that you would just your Holy Spirit would come take complete control of this service father we give it to thee father Lord that you would just brood over your people this evening Lord bless them and keep them fathers our prayer we ask it in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen you may be seated this evening God bless Hallelujah to get to be here uh I I want to to to begin this evening just uh just letting you know uh we we gonna go up a little up and and a little down and maybe just a little roller coaster ride of of of whatever that the Lord would have for us this evening uh a lot of times I I get a little excited I just can't I just go full speed and then I want to come back but you're already too far so I I want to try to take my time a little bit if I can but you know whatever that the Lord would lead it that that's just what we want this evening so one time I was planning on being a forest ranger and I was starting to take the classes at the community college there in New Mexico and we were required to take a certain class a writing class called creative writing and in creative writing they would teach you how that you were to be able to write maybe a short story or if you had plans to to write a book and you know you you would they would show you how how to start that process and of course you know in literature and and writing a short story you would have to begin by having a plot so you would have to think it over and say well what what do I want to talk about or Express or what will be the The Narrative of the story and as I was thinking of our story here this evening of course the the plot would be Okla Homa meetings and you know we would we would have the everything set up for us here at these meetings and you know I was asking brother Wendell today I said what what's the theme brother of of the meetings and he said well brother Manny the Holy Ghost and you know the refilling of a holy ghost or you know the the most important thing that we could do as young people and old is just die out to ourselves and ask that the Lord would come and fill us with the Holy Ghost and so what what what a plot that we have this evening and of course you would have to in this story that would be written you would have to have an introduction and in that introduction we could say it would be maybe a called the exposition or or introduction and you know with that I mean when you look at the the beginning of of writing a story you would have to actually it's possibly the the most important part of the whole process yeah and you you have to cats will say or or grip whoever is going to want to be reading your story you you they want to open up in the first few pages of your story it really has to grip them it has to it has to to to to grab them or or they'll just kind of put it to the side and you know there's another look for another book or something else and so we we find out that that God has has been the greatest book that's ever been written and we find out that when we open that Bible immediately it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and to a Believer it just grips them it grabs or attention we opened it up and said oh my goodness God made all these things and when I read it I don't have a doubt I I don't understand well maybe or this I just there's something inside me that just says Amen to that God did these things and we we look at this introduction of our Bible and you know we I got to thinking on her right over here how that we were listening to the service and you know I was thinking about uh our brother Daryl and and the importance that he had of opening up the service and you know as as a minister we we've had meetings at our church and you know when you have several preachers you know you you don't want to to hurt anybody's feelings so much as to to put them in this spot or this day or or put them maybe on this day when you know there'd be more people and usually just to let the pressure off all always ask the pastor you don't let me start this thing you know whatever that it don't matter to me it don't matter if there's one person there or 150 or 300 it don't matter and you know I got to thinking just how important that the introduction is and so we we look at and what a special honor that was for me to to to come up after a great brother who's preached for all these years and he's been such an inspiration to me and to our family and to the church and you know the things that he's told us he's given us his heart by expressing you know things with between him and sister Cheryl and with their children that have taken place in their lives and we feel special for that so in an introduction when you're writing a story you you have to start there has to be a main character and once the main characters establish you you come and you make a setting and we find out that the settings here this evening and then you you bring out the themes of whatever that you're writing and then you absolutely have to have the conflict and all these things that we're speaking about this evening we see that brother Daryl did last night he did an amazing introduction into these meetings and all these things have come into play and we see that the main character that we're talking about tonight is Jesus Christ [Applause] we see that with that that the setting would be Pawnee Oklahoma and we see that the themes of the meeting would be salvation and and healing and Revival and the Holy Spirit and you know we we heard last night that when the brother was preaching he said if thou can't believe all things are possible and the setting is here this evening and the brothers have said it's all out there it's just going to take something to light it just a little spark this evening and anything can be possible and in the story they teach you that the plot and then you'd have the exposition which is the introduction and then you would come to the rising action and many things would take place in the rising action and then it would come to a part where there would be a climax though the Pinnacle of the meeting and then we find out that after the climax of The Pinnacle then there'd be a falling action and then a resolution tonight I believe in these meetings that were just going to be have surprising action away up to the climax and the climax for us is going to be a rapture and after we take that sir which is the climax then this world can have the solving action and then they can have the resolution but we'll be in the sky Hallelujah with our Jesus by and by [Applause] oh Hallelujah notice I too as the brother was preaching want to give my all for Jesus Christ our brother Daryl was saying you know he's getting old and he's saying I don't want to hear these things from him sister sure I don't want to hear that he's always been one of our heroes it's it was an upsetting time brother during when I would look over and see my dad getting old he'd always been the strength it's strong and you know he'd always have the right words and wisdom and I would look and and then one day you know I turn over and I said my goodness my dad's gotten old and I really didn't realize that until I looked in the mirror and when I looked in the mirror I said my goodness I'm getting old and then I look and say oh my goodness my dad's get he's older than I am and so when brother Daryl was saying you know these ministers and this stuff and and I wanted to jump across the airwaves and say yeah brother but you were inspiration to us you and and brother Jewel and these great men that would cross the country we would that was our inspiration and and I want to tell you because of that some people are preaching today all right but we we find that life is not always a flowery bed of ease and sometimes we come to where we see it's our Wit's End and we're at the end and mother Brandon says this he says when you get to the end of your road when you get to where you can't move he says then it's time then it's time you mean at the end of everything I did when I just want to just give it up and give in and end it all that's the time he said that's the time he said it's time notice what he said he said God will move in by Sovereign Grace if you've come and you're at your Wit's End and maybe you can't take any more I want to tell you Now's the Time today's the time God will move in by Sovereign Grace and take care of the situation [Applause] oh we got a big cup of water you're in trouble bless the Lord he said God will move in by Sovereign Grace the thing that you seek the thing that you seek God will move in by Sovereign Grace Hallelujah notice the thing that you seek and then he gives us an example notice the example that brother Branham takes after what he's telling us here he says you take a little kid a little baby he says they have little cramps and spasms and they'll scream and kick and holler and the first thing that you know they'll hold their breath so now we have a little baby the example and he's crying and he's kicking and he's screaming and he's hollering and he looks at his mama and goes and he holds his breath notice Brother Brad says then he says you'll see the mother grab it and Pat it and throw it up in the air and blow in the face notice he says let it alone he said there's never been in our medical history one ever died like that he said oh he said they won't die hey brothers when you got people in your church that are kicking and they're screaming and they're fussing and they're holding their breath let them alone they'll be all right they're not gonna die is that you holding your breath is that you kicking in a screaming and hollering brother Randall oh they took my privacy oh brother well I always get the worst job for these meetings notice he says there's never in our medical history everyone died like that they won't die he said he's just having a tantrum he's trying to get sympathy he's trying to get some humoring it's just a temper spell and after he gets his temper smell to a place he's hauled his breath where he can't go no fur no farther with it he said then nature steps in than nature steps in to let him hold their breath don't you worry Nature's going to snap in and he relaxes and starts breathing again you can somebody breathe in and breathe out and they start to breathe again oh he says you're picking up and screaming just makes hollering and blowing in his face makes him worse it makes him worse he said that's the way it is with us when we travel from church to church from Pillar To Post from healing service to healing service notice he says take love and start forward until you get to the end of the road how many know that God is love love ain't this human emotion but God is love so you take love which is God and you hold on to him and you keep marching till the end of the road and when you do then God is obligated to cut on the seed [Applause] Hallelujah he's obligated to notice you take love and start forward till you get to the end of the road when love has met its fill God's obligated to help when you've come to your end and man's met their end then Grace takes over it's God's nature to do so notice in the midst of of the either of the age that we're living in with all the unbelief the darkest time the world already falling apart God's love and Grace has reigned and brought up a pride in this age we've taken his word and we've walked with it all the way to the end despite what all the naysayers say and let me tell you God will stand for you as you stand for God [Applause] your sisters think that I'm just preaching to the man you you young sisters in that whole row you just think I'm preaching to these young men what about you what about the sisters and the message what they have to deal with what they've got to put up with hello somebody no doubt silently they're shot there and they're held on to God's word when it seemed like nobody cares but nobody cares I'll carry it for you [Applause] I want to tell you this evening God always proves his word we see the Bible tells us in Revelation chapter 22 and 17 the spirit and the bride what do they say they say come so in other words God Scripture says that they would and we're here to prove that we should Hallelujah we were reading in the Bible in the days of the voice of the seventh angel but we want to bring it all the way back to right now we start off with with a little bit of a history lesson tonight are you with me notice we find out in the days of Adam God told Adam in the day that thou Ed is that thou shalt surely die someone say surely God said you will die and when they partook they did die and we know that God proved his he proved his word notice president said Adam and Eve sinned against the true word they said that there wasn't some made-up Doctrine it was in a man's Doctrine but they sinned against the true word but all he said notice the generations that followed them began to do the same thing and when they did he pronounced death upon them God said I will destroy man he said all will destroy Beast I will destroy the creeping thing and the fowls of the air and we find out that in the days of Noah some would say Noah in the days of Noah our Prophet came and he told us there were all kinds of minister in the days of Noah there were all there were all kinds of ministers in the days of Noah he tells there are all kinds of ministers he said there are all kinds of associations all kinds of religions so when the Bible tells us as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man we've got all kinds of ministers all kinds of associations all kinds of religions but notice brother Braham said and God sent his Prophet Noah notice to prove that he had sent his word and tell them that there was going to be a coming destruction someone say destruction notice he was saying that he could stand no longer he could not stand the way that the people were doing that he had to destroy man that he once created notice but God proved his word how did he do it by sending a flood so in other words we find out that God whatever that he says he follows through on his word in the days of Abraham God told Abraham I will make of thee a great nation and in Romans 4 speaking on Abraham's behalf the Bible says who against hope believed in Hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not somebody say staggered he's staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that which he had promised he was able also to perform so Abraham was fully persuaded what that God had promised God was able to do notice brother Brown says that he proved it notice after all those years he turned Abraham and Cyril back to a young woman and had the baby Hallelujah God always proves his God always proves his God always proves his word always bruising [Music] we don't serve no weakling God we don't serve no Mommy pambi come on through it I said who Christians are running [Applause] sister Christians are rolling sister in my sister Christians are running sister Cheryl sister Christians are rugged all right we'll take you now man how many sisters we have in the building I'm looking at you now are you rugged good in the days of law was told the Lord will destroy this city and we find out that his own family members mocked him they were mocking law they were looking around and saying where is this fire gonna come from it's the same that it is today as it was in those days of law the people are looking around they wonder where is this fire gonna come from well let me tell you if God said it would happen he'll always prove his word better where it takes place Fire's gonna hit this world church I'm telling you boys and girls tonight you better get ready you better get in you better get your family in you better put the blood all over them Hallelujah come on Church no more messing around our brother told us last night we've got to give everything everything you say oh brother Emmanuel preach me happy hey amen me happy too hey how about you make your wife happy by doing the dishes one time how about you make your family happy how about you make your children happy come on Church [Applause] oh Lord I didn't know that I was gonna need some goody goodies break tonight ouch you know they were mocking law his own family so where's that where where where are they gonna get this fire from but you know even law and his condition knew that God always keeps his and law took off and he escaped to the mountain come on church and God proved his he pooped his word and now we have to remember that Abraham said that there was a promise that they would sojourn in Egypt for 400 years and God had told Abraham he said Abram no of Surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years now brother Brian called and he's speaking about Moses notice what he says but one day he said the predestinated seed was born one day the predestinated scene was born and Ronnie when brother Manuel one day it was born one day notice and the child that was a proper child there was something that seemed strange how many here does that describe are you a little strange sister yeah me too they say oh we never know what to expect when brother Manuel comes I don't know what to expect either brother John and sister Jane they don't know what to expect every service either but either way God comes on the scene notice for the Bible says out in the backside of the desert one day he said the Holy Ghost came down in the form of the pillar of fire and settled in a bush and said I have heard the grounds of my people and I remember my promise [Applause] and the time of Deliverance is at hand notice and I'm sending you down there to do it notice what his brother Brown says with a stick in his hand with a stick in his hand his wife on a mule what kind of army is this a man old in age with a stick in his hand his wife riding on a donkey Hallelujah notice he said and a baby in her life hey it looks like a mighty Army to me and notice what he said oh he did it by the power of almighty God how many believe that there's power in the word by who by almighty God it don't matter how small how skinny how big how short how tall it don't matter at all I'll tell you there's power in the word I think some of you sisters ought to get some of that power tonight I think I ought to say I'm tired of all this I'm tired of all these men taking everything I'm going to get my portion tonight [Applause] we're all glory to God sister Evan you got to get your portion brother said the most ridiculous thing he said ridiculous look at it what the world would say that's ridiculous you know what the world would say about this meeting tonight is I can't believe you came out to see that little Spaniard brother yell and scream and get out a bottle of goody goody that's gotta be the most ridiculous and you some of you might even be thinking that right now shame on you after any God deals in the ridiculous brother can he if he die with you he deals in the ridiculous if he deals with me he deals in the ridiculous God deals in ridiculous [Applause] oh Brothers this meeting would seem ridiculous to the eyes of the world oh brother Andrew they would say oh you're listening to to a young man or two older man that to to wild man that's a great man brother Jonas don't think I don't remember you because I do Hallelujah 20 years ago yes sir you're you're balding like I am [Applause] yeah Glory somebody sell Glory tonight see all those guys with a lot of hair they're like calling out Jonas for help come and attack my great looking hair notice he said the most ridiculous thing he said what would a Crooked Stick be to ten thousand Spears you get the picture how how ridiculous a scene that would be Here Comes This Old Man his his wife she's probably just wondering where they're going to find to eat that they could all agree oh man and then they wonder why you don't talk in 12 hours somebody sprayed me down those he said it depends he said where his word is no he said Moses had his word and Pharaoh had his Spears nevertheless God delivers Israel and God proves his God proves his word notice and then after Israel they're taking him out on this Wilderness Journey brother said and he came to pass that they disbelieved this prophet [Music] all right and it came to pass brother Sean that they disbelieved their prophet brother Leo oh if you want a chat you could hit the video later don't worry but I'm getting it out of a message God proving his word if you don't already know and he preached it twice just in case and we're kind of dealing with both [Applause] but notice the willingness Journey and it came to pass that they disbelieved this Prophet after seeing the word so confirmed somebody said confirmed they see that it happened over and over and over and over and over again and they come out to the Wilderness journey and all of a sudden they start to disbelieve this prophet and they started looking at each other as they were coming out of the Wilderness Journey they started looking at each other and this one would come and give this one a little medal and he would give him maybe a paper or or something that was written that said oh doctor of a Preacher and then this one had come over and give this one a little something and say oh doctor of theology and they started having each other these little things as they were coming out of the wilderness well no wonder they started to disbelieve their profit they started looking at each other started handing battles and pans and great things oh you're a great man and you're a great man oh you're a great man oh let me give you this title of Pharisee I think we'll write this title of sadducey on this paper and painted on you or maybe we'll handle oh you're a herodian or maybe come on church or you're this or you're that and they started looking at each other instead of looking at The Giver of Life and all of a sudden they started to disbelieve their profit after seeing the word confirmed and confirmed and confirmed I hope you see where we're going [Applause] notice and in the wilderness Journey it came to pass that they disbelieved this prophet after seeing the word being so confirmed notice brother Brandon takes that and immediately goes into this he says oh he said the bride got out of Step notice what he said he said oh look at what they had done they started to disbelieve and what had happened he said the bride had God out of Step and notice what happens when the bride gets out of Step the prophet had to come back and say get in line get back in line get back in line and when somebody you love maybe they started to disbelieve seen these meetings saw confirmed did you see all the people come up here last night it wasn't that they were being polter prodded they came up cause they believed they believed that they could give their all and they'd come to the end and God in return would answer their prayer already taking place in this meeting tonight notice he said the bride had got out of Step he said you know what I'm speaking about in the vision got out of Step he said but there was one standing up by the name of Joshua we got any Joshua's here this evening stand up for Jesus we got any calebs here this evening why don't you just stand up for Jesus tonight I know who disbelieves in the matter this world come at you I'm standing for with the word of God tonight all you young men here tonight Hallelujah we've got Joshua's and we've got calebs in the building tonight Kaylee's in the building tonight and regardless of the circumstances [Laughter] a few more minutes brother Wendell notice brother Brian said oh he said they went over into the Promised Land and they come back with a bunch of grapes that taken to man I'm gonna tell you those are heavy grapes I mean with two men we can pretty much pack out an elk brother of the best can we do it yeah we could pack out we could pack out it'd be heavy but let me tell you what two men could do so in other words we know they were big grapes brother during taking two men to pack out notice brother Matt takes that scene and he says so that Israel will have the evidence before before they ever even get into the promise they'll have the evidence before they get in to the promise oh Hallelujah the evidence tonight before we ever get in to the promise notice the evidence what were they doing the evidence the evidence what that the land was there they brought back the evidence he said we have a good land the land is right here all right let's just take the glasses off the evidence yeah yeah the evidence they brought back evidences that the land was a good land that the land was flowing with milk and honey they brought back that evidence but the prophet of God said they also brought back an evidence that they were led by the truth that it wasn't the false leading I want to tell you tonight Church how many here have been healed by God then you're the evidence how many years has received the Holy Ghost than ye are the evidence how many years has God touched in their life you are the evidence and you are the evidence brother you are the evidence you're the evidence brother Cali you came all these miles to come and prove to the devil that you are the evidence brother Bryce you're the evidence and you

blood low blood no blood who's here had any of those stand up any unbelievers in here you want to see the evidence you want to see evidence that God is moving in our midst can we have five more minutes brother Wendell [Applause] notice Boatman says can't you see today someone said today can't you see today that if you'll drive a thousand miles to hear the word notice he's talking about his ministry he says and watch it being proved and confirmed it's the evidence that it's a great land many of us who do not withdraw hour after hour for what to prove to the devil we are the evidence I'm coming from my home to come and prove to the devil I'm the evidence our brother said last night I'll give the devil a backup phone [Applause] [Music] aren't you tired of the devil smacking you around aren't you tired of him snacks back smacking you around I'll tell you it's your night this is your day this is your hour to stand for the word and God will stand by you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] notice he says and we see he said oh you can see a shadow of a man lying and dying with cancer be made whole well we didn't have to be there in 65 we saw it at 2023. I want to ask you does God keep his word [Music] [Applause] praise God for 65 though 64. no that way [Applause] notice he said and we see the words of God that he spoke would happen in the day be confirmed it's the evidence that he keeps his word there is a great land notice that in my life he's just about God and God comes down and it Spurs it again that shows that there's an Evidence of eternal life hello an Evidence of eternal life he said where you once would have would have never darkened the door of the church and now you stand in line to get in hey we had a sister in our church about 30 years ago that was some messed up Pastor who knows what his name was but she came and she said I'll never I'll never come to this church again she's in our church tonight praising and worshiping and thanking God because she used the evidence it's an Evidence your the evidence I look out tonight you're the goods there used to be a preacher in this message so you better be packing the goods what does that even mean putting pressure on me before I come out well you better be packing the goods but I tell you tonight Church you better be packing the goods in the midst of this evil age and I told my church he said Church you know why I'm preaching it over and over again because unbelief I've never seen it like it is right now and through all the unbelief God is still proving his word our belief doesn't stop my God [Applause] she's my God the belief doesn't put him on his heels I believe does not stop our God [Applause] one more [Music] notice brother says I want you to notice he does it in a way he does it that way in every age someone say every age he does it every time by the same method someone say the same method he's got to predestinate it to that age he says you see it again he's got to predestinate the thing to be there where where's there here there is here he's got a predestinated over there where here where here where's there here with who me who they're here you me he said well is he speaking Apache we're there here are you me [Applause] you didn't think we'd be speaking in tongues tonight did you brother Daryl when we are where there are you me where's there right here who's he talking about you me you me notice he's got to be predestinate this thing to be there where to meet the challenge of the age you mean God picked you brother Bryce to to meet the challenge of the age [Applause] use that search out like who looks like the most feeble one and say who they say me where here why because God said so to do what to show the devil there'd be a bride in this last stage why would he do that because he said that there would be who me we're here [Music] [Applause] notice he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age so now we see that unbelief has come in like a flood hey we try to shut the door sometimes but we'll shut the door unbelief is coming in stay out of beliefs stay alive but no matter what it seems like that the door is open and the enemy has come in like a flood but God has raised up a people in this day as a standard he chose me he chose you and I care when the enemy comes by as a flood God has raised up a bride in this last stage [Applause] so don't let all this unbelief scare you you okay baby you okay I'll let you preach more in the church oh you need you need a position you need a position baby I'm trying to behave brother somebody say breathe brother ah I believe has me upset it messes with everything everything aren't you glad you're a Believer tonight [Applause] so the Bible says that God the Lord would raise a standard can we amen the word well so that we're all on the same page I looked up the word standard concerning this phrase not somewhere out here not in right there in the Lexicon write out the message where we look hit it hit it brother boom you oh there it is that word standard means flee it means Escape [Music] oh you think you're gonna be here to come and no he's going to take you up out of here Hey Brother Andrew let them old Fighters fight their way out of a paper bag argue about music let him argue about prayer lines let them argue about all these things let them argue but God don't want our yours he wants believers he wants those that are just crazy enough he's working in the ridiculous realm with Brothers like brother Manuel [Applause] the Colby's [Applause] and brother brother Williams [Music] standard Mr flee Escape take flight disappear this up here [Applause] notice River says he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age then he says did you get it then he says did you feel it hope it didn't matter we were told we must never fail oh God you were told you you can't feel it some of you were told you don't feel it we don't go by feelings oh we don't we go by the word but let me tell you the word sure feels good [Applause] the words feels good we don't go by feelings but it sure feels good notice what he said he said did you get it did you feel it he said did you see it did you understand that he said that's what's happening today he predestinated it to this how brother Emmanuel by his foreknowledge brother Manuel we were taught we must never say predestination predestination predestination predestination predestination predestination predestination predestination oh be careful brother no predestination by foreknowledge my house foreign [Music] [Applause] you mean it's not an accident that you're here big brother you think that you all of a sudden you just rolled in and thought I'm gonna take up a spot and it's gonna be all right on the back row no no no no hey little brother you weren't here just because you lived close by God predestinated you to be here since before the foundation of the world how by his foreknowledge he knew he knew who would be here he knew who would be here as his evidence brother that's why he trusts you if somebody is going to represent me I better trust them and despite yourself I'm gonna leave it for the next guy well Hallelujah those are dapple words brother who told you that that's what's happening today someone say today he predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge unbelief has not scared our God people leaving people fleeing people running people hiding does not come on Church I like this part I say brother Ruben or where is everybody tonight he said I'm here oh you say oh brother there we used to come with family and all these people I knew would let me tell you you're here how are you here he predestinated you to be here we're right here tonight okay notice he said did you get it did you feel it did you see it did you understand it that's what's happening today do you feel it yes do you see it do you understand it Hallelujah notice he said by his far knowledge when he predestinated it in Malachi 4. it's got to happen [Applause] if God at what point had his word and he he said oh if you eat from here you're gonna die and he proved his word come on church he proved his word to adamant to Eve and he proved it to Noah and he proved it to Abraham and he proved it to Paul and he proved it to Wesley and he proved it to Luther and he proved it to Pentecost and he's putting it in an eye how he said that you would have a church without spot or wrinkle and he's proving it when where's there there land Hallelujah Hallelujah right now he said all we have what why do you think [Applause] so it's written hello it's written in the scriptures and he said it's going to happen and it's nice just to look and say it's going to happen and you say well it's happening right now oh no but he says it's going to happen brother when he told Noah that there was going to be a flood what if Noah would have said yeah but you know he said that they would surely die but he needed it to happen in his day that's right this is where we get the argument between the message and the Bible [Music] right he said well I believe the Bible but uh the message scares me well no one could have said oh I believe in what happened with Adam but when you're telling me scares me he had to accept the word for his day I think it's about time we stopped looking to the day's past and find out what's happening in our day [Applause] and here we've come to our day with Malachi 4 5. and Malachi 45 guess what happens it comes out of the pages in Revelation 10 7 comes off the pages here what age was I predestinated for the last days oh I'm here the Bible said I'll be here the Bible said I'm here I'm out of the pain [Applause] sure is like man believers and then the Bible said in Revelations 22 that the spirit and the bride would say and we come after somebody come on [Applause] wake up and come out of the page get out of it not only in word only come off the page [Applause] I believe it's time we step out [Music] where'd he come from where'd this little man come from why is he screaming he's excited Church I said oh brother man we don't believe in screaming it scares me [Music] if the musicians would come up you love the Lord can I [Applause] [Laughter] thank you oh if the musicians would come up tonight Stay Stay standing tonight we're going to try to close here notice when he predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestinates anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride someone say bride she's going to be there going in a Rapture oh checks There Ain't No Grave gotta hold my body down Hey There Ain't No Gray brother Daryl gonna hold this little body down it's coming up British on it don't matter by the way of the Grave or the way of the Rapture Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] you know he said brother man you get excited I'd get excited yeah oh brother don't worry he just gets a little excited it's an exciting time let me tell you when you give your all and you have nothing left to give it's exciting to see God come through [Music] as they play softly you trust the Lord
