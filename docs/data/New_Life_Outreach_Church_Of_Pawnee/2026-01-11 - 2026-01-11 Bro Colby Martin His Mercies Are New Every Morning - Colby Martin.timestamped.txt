[40:03] What could be
[40:05] too great a cost
[40:10] for sharing life
[40:13] with one who's lost
[40:18] through his love.
[40:21] Our hearts
[40:23] can feel

[40:38] of life
[40:41] that only we can share.

[44:27] hot water to get to that sink. Amen. We
[44:30] might even wash some dishes now.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; I take that back. How'd that slip out?
[44:39] Amen.
[44:41] And then uh we also put in uh a brand
[44:45] new uh heating and air conditioning unit
[44:48] at the fellowship hall yesterday.
[44:53] The these brothers pushed me real hard,
[44:56] Nick.
[44:58] They pushed me to
[45:02] what?
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Well, we'll work on that. But uh so uh
[45:08] it's working. Everything's working fine.
[45:10] I I I checked it last night and it's
[45:13] just it was really toasty in there.
[45:15] Brother uh Michael put it on uh uh on 74
[45:20] degrees and just uh kind of burn off
[45:22] that new smell that you get and uh and I
[45:26] went back by there a few hours later and
[45:28] it was already up to 74 degrees and the
[45:31] furnace was was already kicked off. And
[45:33] so I turned her back down to 68 just to
[45:37] just to save money like I like I like I
[45:40] try to do. But uh we sure appreciate all
[45:43] the uh all you brothers for all all that
[45:46] you did and save the
[45:49] saves the church a lot of money cuz we
[45:52] don't we don't have that much money. Uh
[45:56] and if you didn't know it I'm the
[45:57] treasurer.
[46:00] So if you if you if there's something
[46:03] you can do for the church, uh I tell you
[46:06] what, I I I collect aluminum cans just
[46:10] to recycle. I just something to do, you
[46:14] know. I think brother Steve Karen, y'all
[46:16] still do that?
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[46:20] &gt;&gt; You do a lot of recycling. Yeah. I uh I
[46:24] have hundreds of pounds of aluminum I
[46:26] need to uh I need to put uh take to the
[46:31] recycling center and uh Lord laid that
[46:33] on my heart uh to give that to missions
[46:36] and evangelistic uh kind of an offering.
[46:40] So uh pray the Lord will bless that and
[46:43] uh Amen. So not not no harm in
[46:47] recycling. Amen. So there's uh they say
[46:50] there's hundreds and hundreds of tons of
[46:54] of uh trash out on our oceans and rivers
[46:57] and lakes and Amen. And we see it on the
[47:00] side of the road every day and I you
[47:02] know I threw out a bottle one time as a
[47:04] teenager and my cousin goes, "Why did
[47:06] you do that?"
[47:08] I don't know. Just just throwing out a
[47:10] bottle on the side of the road. That's
[47:12] littering. You shouldn't do that.
[47:16] Well, I got convicted. I got con
[47:18] convicted like, you know, you're right.
[47:20] You're right. So, I changed my ways and
[47:23] so young people don't litter.
[47:32] Now, I think there's a scripture
[47:34] something about those that destroy the
[47:35] earth, God will destroy. So, I know that
[47:37] littering seems like a little small
[47:39] thing, but it adds up. Brother Mitch.
[47:42] Amen. Just like every aluminum can I I
[47:45] keep it is it adds up doesn't it brother
[47:48] Steve Sister Karen. So Amen. But
[47:50] anything you can do for God God will
[47:53] bless you and reward you for it. Amen.
[47:56] Time many times over. So Amen. Just
[47:59] think about that this morning. Well, how
[48:01] many is ready for the word of the Lord?
[48:03] Amen. We appreciate brother Kobe and his
[48:07] ministry and just all of our ministers.
[48:10] And uh so let's get behind brother Kobe
[48:12] this morning. And as I promised, I want
[48:15] to sing that song that brother Rundle
[48:18] was talking about faith and Amen. And uh
[48:21] and uh I believe we uh uh people got
[48:24] some faith Wednesday night. How many
[48:25] enjoyed the service Wednesday night and
[48:28] people found the Lord and got delivered
[48:31] and set free and that's what it's all
[48:33] about is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[48:36] Amen. Who the sun sets free is free
[48:38] indeed. Amen. And as brother Kobe comes,
[48:41] let's just sing this old chorus. Have
[48:43] faith in God. Amen. Oh, have
[48:48] faith in God.
[48:55] Just have
[48:58] faith
[49:00] in God. Oh, it's been a while.
[49:04] Oh,
[49:06] have
[49:09] faith
[49:11] in God for the answer.
[49:16] Have faith
[49:20] in
[49:22] God.
[49:26] Oh, have
[49:30] faith
[49:31] in God.
[49:36] Oh, have
[49:40] faith
[49:42] in God.
[49:46] Oh, have
[49:50] faith
[49:52] in God for the answer.
[49:57] Have faith. Without faith, it's
[50:00] impossible to please God. But he'll give
[50:03] it to you this morning if you ask. So,
[50:07] let's have
[50:10] faith
[50:11] in God.
[50:17] Oh,
[50:27] come
[50:31] in
[50:33] for the answer.
[50:44] Amen. Oh morning,
[50:49] I see you in the sunrise every morning.
[50:56] It's like a picture that you paint it
[51:00] for
[51:02] me.
[51:05] A love letter in the sky.
[51:11] Oh, story.
[51:15] I could have had a really different
[51:20] story,
[51:23] but you stepped down from heaven to
[51:27] restore.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[51:32] Forever
[51:33] change my life.
[51:38] Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus.
[51:46] I'll stand in all of your amazing
[51:51] ways.
[51:53] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[52:04] Nobody loves me like you.
[52:09] Amen. Oh, mountains,
[52:15] you're breaking down the weight of every
[52:19] mountain.
[52:22] Even when it feels like I'm surrounded.
[52:29] Yes, Lord. You never leave my side. Are
[52:34] you thankful for that? Here this
[52:35] morning, nobody loves me. Nobody loves
[52:39] me like you love me. Jesus,
[52:44] I stand in all of your amazing
[52:49] ways.
[52:52] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[52:59] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[53:04] loves me like you.
[53:09] Hallelujah. Can you say amen to that
[53:12] here this morning?
[53:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:17] I'm so glad that his mercies are are new
[53:19] every morning. Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that his love is is never
[53:25] changing. that it's so glad the Lord
[53:28] doesn't go through mood swings.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; So glad he's he's he's never failing.
[53:34] He's always loving us when we're been
[53:36] unlovable and he's never never forsaken
[53:39] us. Amen. I'm so glad for that here this
[53:41] morning. And God bless you. I'd like to
[53:43] turn to Isaiah 63. Want to say it is
[53:47] good to see brother Luke back with us
[53:49] here this morning. Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Last time I seen him, he uh
[53:56] just got out of surgery and he was a
[53:58] little high. So,
[54:00] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[54:02] It really is good to see him here this
[54:03] morning. Amen. Amen. Isaiah 63 and verse
[54:07] 7. We got a few passages of scripture,
[54:10] so we'll read this and let you be
[54:11] seated. But Isaiah 63 and7 it says, "I
[54:15] will mention the loving kindness of the
[54:16] Lord and the praises of the Lord
[54:19] according to all that the Lord has
[54:21] bestowed on us and the greatness uh the
[54:25] great goodness toward the house of
[54:26] Israel which he has bestowed upon them
[54:30] according to his mercies and according
[54:32] to the multitude of his loving kindness.
[54:36] For he has said, "Surely they are my
[54:38] people, children that will not lie." So
[54:41] he was their savior and in all their
[54:44] affliction he was afflicted and the
[54:47] angel of his presence saved them and in
[54:50] his love and in his pity he redeemed
[54:52] them and he bured them and carried them
[54:55] all the days of old. Heavenly Father,
[54:58] how we love you here this morning, Lord.
[55:01] And we're so thankful for your presence
[55:04] that we feel here today. And father, I'm
[55:07] asking that you'll continue to be with
[55:09] us here, Lord, in this remaining part of
[55:11] this service. Lord, touch all the ones
[55:13] that ain't feeling well. I know brother
[55:15] Michael is not feeling good this
[55:17] morning, Lord. I I pray that you just
[55:19] touch him and strengthen him here this
[55:21] morning. Father, anyone else that's
[55:23] afflicted in their mind, in their body,
[55:25] Lord, just be with us here for the
[55:27] remaining part of this service. In your
[55:29] name we pray. Amen. And amen. Can we
[55:32] turn? You may be seated here this
[55:34] morning. Can we turn to Psalms 145 and
[55:37] verse one?
[55:39] Psalms 145 and verse one. Amen.
[55:46] Telling brother Michael, you know, this
[55:48] is going to be just a like a Bible study
[55:50] here this morning. I I leave the the
[55:53] deep preaching to them. So, if you heard
[55:55] this before, just bear with me. Amen.
[55:59] Psalms 145 and verse one. It says, "I
[56:01] will extol thee, oh God, my God, oh
[56:05] king. I will bless thy name forever and
[56:08] ever. Every day will I bless thee, and I
[56:11] will praise thy name forever and ever.
[56:13] Great is the Lord, and greatly to be
[56:15] praised. And his greatness is
[56:18] unsearchable.
[56:19] One generation shall praise thy works to
[56:21] another, and shall declare thy mighty
[56:24] acts.
[56:26] I will speak of the glorious honor of
[56:28] thy majesty and thy wondrous works. And
[56:31] men shall speak of the might of thy
[56:34] terrible acts, and I will declare thy
[56:36] greatness. Amen.
[56:38] They shall abundantly utter the memory
[56:41] of thy great goodness, and shall sing of
[56:43] thy righteousness. I love this. The Lord
[56:46] is gracious and full of compassion, slow
[56:49] to anger, and of great mercy. The Lord
[56:53] is good to all and his tender mercies
[56:56] are over all his works. One more passage
[56:59] of scripture. Lamentations 3 and verse
[57:02] 22.
[57:05] Lamentations 3 and verse 22. Amen.
[57:08] It says, "It is of the Lord's mercies
[57:10] that we are not consumed
[57:13] because his compassions faileth not.
[57:16] They are new every morning." Amen.
[57:19] Great is thy faithfulness.
[57:22] And if I had a very simple title, I
[57:25] won't keep you too long this morning. It
[57:26] would be his mercies are are new every
[57:30] morning. And I begin to think about this
[57:32] this title or this this uh topic this
[57:36] past week and begin to think of how good
[57:40] God has been
[57:41] &gt;&gt; to every one of us and the mercies that
[57:45] he continually shows us every day.
[57:47] Right.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; It's it's as we've been hearing through
[57:49] the messages, uh, his his mercies are
[57:52] not are not given to us based on how
[57:54] good we are. And it based on if we fail
[57:58] him or if we make a mistake. But his
[58:00] mercies, thank God, are new. Every
[58:03] morning, every day you get up out of
[58:05] bed, there's a new mercy there for you.
[58:07] You're you're you're not you're not
[58:09] going into a new day with with
[58:11] yesterday's problems. But God's mercy is
[58:14] is is is unfathomable. It's it's
[58:16] something that never gets old. Amen. And
[58:20] we see that God didn't let you wake up
[58:22] this morning because you were perfect.
[58:24] Amen. How many perfect people do we have
[58:26] this morning?
[58:28] We're not perfect, but God let you wake
[58:31] up because he's merciful. And if you
[58:34] open your eyes this morning, IT'S PROOF
[58:36] THAT GOD IS NOT DONE WITH you yet. Amen.
[58:39] And God has not given up on you. And
[58:42] God's mercy is is still working in your
[58:44] life here this morning. And we begin to
[58:47] see that we're here today because of the
[58:49] mercy of God. It's it's God's mercy that
[58:52] you have a sound mind this morning. IT'S
[58:55] IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT OUT OF the 8
[58:58] million people that's on the face OF THE
[59:00] EARTH. GOD ALLOWED YOU TO BE HERE. And
[59:02] he allowed you to hear the greatest
[59:04] message that's ever hit planet Earth.
[59:06] IT'S IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT HE ALLOWED
[59:09] YOU NOT TO JUST HEAR IT, BUT TO ACCEPT
[59:12] IT IN YOUR HEART AND RECEIVE IT. THAT'S
[59:14] GOD'S MERCY. BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN MANY
[59:16] PEOPLE THAT HAS HEARD THE MESSAGE,
[59:18] &gt;&gt; BUT HAS NOT HAD A HEART TO ACCEPT IT AND
[59:21] RECEIVE IT. BUT YOU'RE HERE THIS MORNING
[59:24] BECAUSE IT'S GOD'S MERCY UPON YOUR LIFE.
[59:27] NOT BY YOUR MERITS AND NOT BY WHAT
[59:29] YOU'VE DONE, BUT IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT
[59:31] YOU'VE HEARD IT AND YOU'VE ACCEPTED AND
[59:33] RECEIVED THE GREATEST MESSAGE THAT'S OUT
[59:36] THERE.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; We have over a little over 8 million
[59:40] people on the face of the earth and here
[59:42] you sit this morning.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; It's God's mercy to you. I know it's
[59:46] going TO BE VERY SIMPLE, BUT I WANT YOU
[59:48] TO UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD GOD IS TO YOU
[59:51] THIS MORNING. IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT that
[59:54] we're here with with with with healing
[59:57] IN OUR BODY. AND IT'S GOD'S MERCY THAT
[59:59] WE HAVE A CHANCE, AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME
[1:00:02] BEFORE THE THRONE WITH BOLDNESS. It's
[1:00:05] mercy.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; But I want to look at this scripture
[1:00:08] that we just read in Lamentations. And
[1:00:11] Jeremiah was writing this in the midst
[1:00:13] of destruction. We begin to see that the
[1:00:15] city was burned and the temple was
[1:00:18] destroyed. The nation WAS BEING JUDGED.
[1:00:21] YET IN ALL OF THAT, JEREMIAH CAN SAY,
[1:00:24] "GOD IS STILL MERCIFUL."
[1:00:27] HE CAN SAY, "GOD IS STILL FAITHFUL AND
[1:00:29] GOD IS STILL GOOD." AND NO MATTER WHAT
[1:00:32] CIRCUMSTANCE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS
[1:00:34] MORNING,
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; God's mercy will always be there for
[1:00:37] you.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; MERCY IS NOT BASED ON ON YOUR
[1:00:41] CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT IT'S BASED UPON THE
[1:00:44] CHARACTER OF GOD. IT'S THE LORD'S
[1:00:46] MERCIES THAT WERE not consumed,
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; but it is new every morning. NOW WE SEE
[1:00:51] THAT GOD REVEALS HIS MERCY WHEN life
[1:00:54] looks the worst, doesn't he?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; But this word consumed, it means to be
[1:01:00] destroyed or or outtaken, wiped out,
[1:01:03] lost, AND BEYOND REPAIR. SO WHY SHOULD
[1:01:08] WE HAVE BEEN CONSUMED? Let's look on
[1:01:10] that for just a minute. We should have
[1:01:12] been consumed by sin. WE DIDN'T JUST
[1:01:14] SLIP, BUT WE FELL HARD, H, didn't we?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; All right, BROTHER. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
[1:01:18] CONSUMED BY LIFE'S PRESSURES. Some of
[1:01:21] those storms that we have BEEN THROUGH
[1:01:23] SHOULD HAVE CRUSHED YOU. WE SHOULD HAVE
[1:01:26] BEEN CONSUMED BY THE ENEMY.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Are you with ME THIS
[1:01:29] MORNING? THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE DEVOURED
[1:01:32] YOU IF IF GOD WOULD HAVE ALLOWED IT.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSUMED BY YOUR
[1:01:37] PAST. AMEN. SHAME SHOULD HAVE EATEN YOU
[1:01:40] ALIVE HERE THIS MORNING. THINK ABOUT IT.
[1:01:42] THINKING ABOUT YOUR PAST, HOW HOW IT CAN
[1:01:44] DRIVE YOU CRAZY AND DRIVE YOU MAD, BUT
[1:01:47] YOU'RE SITTING HERE THIS MORNING WITH
[1:01:49] YOUR PAST FORGIVEN.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN CONSUMED
[1:01:54] BY YOUR CONSEQUENCES THAT THE CHOICES
[1:01:56] that we've made. IT SHOULD HAVE HAD YOU
[1:01:58] IN AN EMPTY GRAVE.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY BLOCKED IT. MERCY STEPPED IN
[1:02:06] WHEN YOU WERE WEAK.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WERE WRONG, WHEN YOU WERE
[1:02:10] REBELLIOUS, WHEN YOU WERE ROTTED, WHEN
[1:02:12] YOU WERE TIRED, AND WHEN YOU WERE
[1:02:14] BROKEN. MERCY NEVER GETS TIRED.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; MERCY NEVER GETS WEARY. EVEN THOUGH IN
[1:02:20] OUR MIND, WE MAY SEEM JUST LIKE WE'RE
[1:02:22] GOING TO FALL UNDER THE STRAIN. MERCY
[1:02:25] NEVER GETS OVERWHELMED.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY IS THERE TO PICK YOU UP IN
[1:02:29] YOUR LOWEST TIMES.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; It's mercy. YEAH,
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; I CAN PREACH ABOUT MERCY THIS MORNING
[1:02:35] BECAUSE I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT MERCY.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; I'VE HAD A PAST. I WAS RUNNING FROM GOD,
[1:02:41] BUT IT WAS MERCY THAT LED ME RIGHT BACK
[1:02:43] TO HERE AGAIN.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; It's God's mercy.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IS MERCY HERE THIS MORNING?
[1:02:51] MERCY IS GOD WITHHOLDING WHAT YOU DO
[1:02:53] DESERVE.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; MERCY IS GOD PROTECTING YOU FROM
[1:02:58] JUDGMENT.
[1:02:59] MERCY IS GOD KEEPING YOU FROM YOUR OWN
[1:03:02] DESTRUCTION.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; MERCY IS GOD STOPPING THE CONSEQUENCES
[1:03:06] FROM HITTING YOU FULL FORCE.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; MERCY IS GOD COVERING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU
[1:03:11] FALL.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. MERCY IS GOD SAYING, "NO,
[1:03:16] THEY BELONG TO ME."
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; MERCY IS THE ONLY REASON YOU SURVIVED
[1:03:22] THE CAR ACCIDENTS.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; MERCY IS THE ONLY REASON YOU HAVEN'T
[1:03:25] LOST YOUR MIND OR OR DIED IN SIN. MERCY
[1:03:29] IS THE REASON THAT ADDICTION DIDN'T
[1:03:31] DESTROY YOU.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU'RE NOT A DRUNK IN A BAR
[1:03:34] SOMEWHERE OR OR STRUNG OUT ON DRUGS LIKE
[1:03:36] YOU WERE. IT'S MERCY.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T DESERVE GOD'S GRACE AND LOVE,
[1:03:42] BUT MERCY IS STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND
[1:03:45] DESTRUCTION.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; I hope you can get what I'm saying this
[1:03:51] morning. Brother Brandham says, "That's
[1:03:52] it. It isn't whether I can hang on or
[1:03:55] not. It isn't whether I CAN HOLD OUT.
[1:03:57] IT'S WHETHER HE holds out.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that I CAN DO. IT'S WHAT
[1:04:03] HE HAS DONE FOR ME.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; What Christ has DONE FOR ME IN GOD.
[1:04:07] THAT'S THE REASON I'm saved today. YES,
[1:04:09] SIR. NOT BY WHAT I CAN DO. NOT BY GOOD
[1:04:12] WORKS ARE WE SAVED, BUT BY HIS MERCIES.
[1:04:15] Oh my. God has saved us in Christ
[1:04:20] unconditionally.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother, Colby, why did we
[1:04:23] need mercy?" Romans 3 and 23 says, "All
[1:04:27] have sinned."
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; And come short of the glory of God.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; GOOD POINT.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF SIN, WE DESERVED DEATH,
[1:04:36] JUDGMENT,
[1:04:37] SEPARATION. We deserved punishment. WE
[1:04:40] DESERVE TO GO TO A DEVIL'S HELL. IT'S
[1:04:43] TRUE.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; I know you've heard this before, but
[1:04:46] it's IT'S TRUE. BUT GOD STEPS IN THROUGH
[1:04:48] MERCY AND SAYS, "I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN
[1:04:51] TO YOU." THAT'S MERCY.
[1:04:54] IF WE COULD JUST STOP AND SEE WHERE GOD
[1:04:56] HAS BROUGHT US FROM.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD BE LIKE THE 8 MILLION PEOPLE
[1:05:02] OUT THERE THAT IS STILL STUCK IN THEIR
[1:05:05] CONDITIONS.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; THAT HAS HAD AN EAR TO HEAR IT BUT NOT
[1:05:09] BE ABLE TO ACCEPT IT, REJECT IT, REFUSED
[1:05:12] IT. BUT MERCY ALLOWED YOU TO BE HERE
[1:05:15] THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF GOD'S LOVE.
[1:05:17] HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; But we can see mercy all throughout the
[1:05:22] scripture. Adam and Eve, mercy covered
[1:05:25] their shame. GOD COULD HAVE KILLED THEM.
[1:05:28] HALLELUJAH. BUT AS THEY WERE WALKING
[1:05:30] OUT, HE SLEW A LAMB AND HE CLOTHED THEM
[1:05:34] WITH THAT BLOOD. THAT'S MERCY.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; NOAH. MERCY MADE A WAY OF ESCAPE.
[1:05:43] GOD SAVING his household because mercy
[1:05:46] intervenes before judgment. Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. We can see David and how mercy
[1:05:51] spared a man who failed badly. IF YOU
[1:05:54] WANT TO LOOK AT A MAN IN THE BIBLE THAT
[1:05:55] had mistakes, it was David.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; sure.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; HE DID SIN,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY restored him again.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; We see Jonah, mercy gave him a second
[1:06:08] chance,
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; RUNNING FROM GOD ON HIS WAY, HALLELUJAH,
[1:06:12] to Tarsus.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY RAN AFTER HIM. WE CAN WE CAN
[1:06:16] ALL RELATE WITH JONAH. YEAH.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; HOW WE WERE RUNNING THE OPPOSITE WAY.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS MERCY THAT BROUGHT US BACK
[1:06:25] AGAIN. YOU MAY HAVE RAN and you MAY HAVE
[1:06:28] RAN AND YOU MAY HAVE DONE SOME THINGS IN
[1:06:30] YOUR LIFE, BUT MERCY NEVER LET YOU GO.
[1:06:33] IT WAS MERCY THAT RESTORED YOU BACK
[1:06:35] AGAIN.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Peter, mercy restored a denier.
[1:06:44] We see him. HE HE DENIED CHRIST THREE
[1:06:47] TIMES PUBLICLY. AND the next thing we
[1:06:49] see is Peter fishing naked on a boat.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY BROUGHT HIM BACK AGAIN.
[1:06:57] JESUS TELLS MARY, "GO TELL MY
[1:07:00] DISCIPLES." OH, and Peter.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; AND PETER.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JUST BECAUSE YOU FAIL GOD
[1:07:06] DOESN'T MEAN THAT GOD FORGETS ABOUT YOU.
[1:07:09] JUST BECAUSE YOU MAKE A MISTAKE AND YOU
[1:07:12] FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF
[1:07:14] THAT MISTAKE, THE DEVIL WILL COME IN AND
[1:07:16] TELL YOU THAT THAT GOD HAS FORGOTTEN
[1:07:18] ABOUT YOU. THAT GOD WILL FORSAKE YOU
[1:07:19] BECAUSE YOU MESSED UP. YOU MADE A
[1:07:21] MISTAKE. REMEMBER, GOD IS NOT MOODY.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR MISTAKE,
[1:07:28] BUT GOD BRINGS YOU BACK INTO HIS LOVING
[1:07:30] ARMS AGAIN. THAT'S MERCY.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my. MERCY IS WHAT HAS KEPT YOU ALIVE
[1:07:38] TODAY. Oh my.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Kobe, I got a past."
[1:07:44] We all got pasts.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; We're not perfect here this morning.
[1:07:48] We've made mistakes,
[1:07:50] but it's God's mercy that can wipe you
[1:07:52] clean again.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; It's God's GRACE AND HIS BLOOD THAT HAS
[1:07:56] BROUGHT YOU HERE AND HAS TAKEN THE VERY
[1:07:59] SCENT OF SIN out of your life.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; It's mercy.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. We see here judgment says
[1:08:07] you deserve punishment.
[1:08:11] Mercy said I took the punishment FOR
[1:08:13] YOU.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; JUDGMENT SAYS YOU ARE GUILTY. AND IT'S
[1:08:17] TRUE.
[1:08:18] BUT MERCY SAYS YOU ARE FORGIVEN.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; MERCY TRIUMPHS OVER judgment every time.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE DEVIL TRIES TO
[1:08:29] BRING UP THE PAST, REMIND HIM OF WHAT
[1:08:32] GOD DID FOR YOU ON CALVARY 2,000 YEARS
[1:08:35] AGO, REMIND HIM THAT THE BLOOD NEVER
[1:08:38] LOSES ITS POWER. NO MATTER HOW STRONG
[1:08:41] THE CHAINS OF THE ENEMY MAY BE UPON YOUR
[1:08:44] LIFE, REMEMBER THE BLOOD BREAKS EVERY
[1:08:47] SHACKLE. THIS MORNING,
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; we've had some deliverances TAKE PLACE
[1:08:52] WEDNESDAY. DON'T LET THE DEVIL TELL you
[1:08:55] that this is that that is is is JUST
[1:08:58] SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU JUST WENT
[1:08:59] THROUGH. YOU'LL FALL BACK INTO YOUR SIN
[1:09:01] AGAIN. THE BLOOD COVERS THE MISTAKE.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE FREE, STAY FREE HERE THIS
[1:09:06] MORNING. DON'T LET THE DEVIL TAKE BACK
[1:09:08] WHAT THE GOD TOOK FROM HIM.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; TRUE, BROTHER.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; But mercy,
[1:09:17] it protects you.
[1:09:20] Hallelujah. You have no DON'T HAVE ANY
[1:09:22] IDEA HOW MANY times the enemy has tried
[1:09:25] to kill you in your sleep but mercy said
[1:09:27] no.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY TIMES YOUR MISTAKE
[1:09:32] SHOULD HAVE DESTROYED your your your
[1:09:34] future but mercy stepped in. I hope this
[1:09:37] is okay.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; How many times YOU SHOULD HAVE LOST
[1:09:40] EVERYTHING BUT mercy protected you here
[1:09:43] this morning.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:47] God shows you mercy in the darkest of
[1:09:50] moments. We see that Jeremiah was
[1:09:53] preaching mercy while standing in the
[1:09:55] ruins.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the clearest view of mercy is
[1:10:00] not on the mountain, but it's when
[1:10:02] you're in the rubble.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE NOT ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP, BUT
[1:10:06] WHEN YOU'RE IN THE VALLEY.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; EVEN WHEN YOU HIT ROCK BOTTOM. OH MY.
[1:10:12] THERE'S MERCY AT THE BOTTOM WAITING for
[1:10:14] you there.
[1:10:16] MERCY IS THERE TO PICK YOU BACK UP AND
[1:10:18] PUT YOU BACK ON THE PATH. THAT'S WHAT
[1:10:20] MERCY IS FOR.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Now that we understand mercy, is this
[1:10:31] okay this morning?
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT GOD'S NEW mercy
[1:10:36] does in your life every single morning.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Because we understand that mercy is new.
[1:10:42] Yeah.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Every morning, every sunrise is God
[1:10:46] saying, "Try again."
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Start over.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; You've been forgiven. Oh my.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT FINISHED. YOU'RE STILL MINE.
[1:10:57] EVERY TIME THE SUN RISES UP AND YOU
[1:10:59] STILL GOT A SOUND MIND. You ought to
[1:11:01] thank God for that.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; EVERY TIME THAT SUN RISES AND YOUR
[1:11:05] FAMILY IS STILL PUT TOGETHER, YOU OUGHT
[1:11:08] TO THANK GOD FOR THAT. EVERY TIME THE
[1:11:10] SUN RISES AND YOU STILL HAVE HEALTH IN
[1:11:13] YOUR BODY AND OXYGEN IN YOUR LUNGS, YOU
[1:11:16] OUGHT TO THANK GOD FOR THAT. THAT'S
[1:11:17] GOD'S MERCY. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE die
[1:11:20] daily, but you're still here.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS GOD IS NOT DONE WITH YOU YET.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; AND WHILE YOU'RE STILL HERE, YOU OUGHT
[1:11:28] TO PRAISE GOD EVERY SINGLE DAY OF YOUR
[1:11:30] LIFE.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; SAY, GOD, THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE
[1:11:33] DONE. THANK YOU FOR MY FAMILY.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. EVERY MORNING, MERCY WIPES
[1:11:40] YESTERDAY CLEAN. WE SEE IN PSALMS 23, HE
[1:11:44] RESTORES my soul.
[1:11:47] Mercy restores your joy. IT GIVES YOU
[1:11:50] YOUR PEACE AND YOUR REST AND YOUR
[1:11:53] STRENGTH. MERCYY'S THERE TO pick you UP
[1:11:55] WHEN LIFE KNOCKS YOU DOWN.
[1:11:58] Ain't that right? We see that MERCY
[1:12:01] REBUILDS
[1:12:03] WHAT YOU HAVE LOST. MERCY JUST DOESN'T
[1:12:06] FORGIVE YOU, BUT IT REBUILDS YOU AGAIN.
[1:12:09] MERCY PUTS BACK WHAT SHAME HAS TOOK.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; WHAT FEAR HAS BROKEN,
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT SIN HAS DAMAGED, WHAT TRAUMA HAS
[1:12:19] STOLE. MERCY PUTS IT BACK TOGETHER.
[1:12:22] MERCY JUST DOESN'T LEAVE YOU HALFWAY
[1:12:24] HEALED, BUT IT completely restores.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; So when David says, HE HE RESTORETH MY
[1:12:31] SOUL. DAVID HAS BEEN THERE BROKEN,
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; BUT HE KNOWS A GOD THAT RESTORED HIM
[1:12:38] BACK TO WHAT HE WAS AGAIN. HE DIDN'T
[1:12:41] LEAVE HIM BROKEN IN THE STATE HE was in.
[1:12:44] AND WE CAN ALL HAVE A TESTIMONY OF THAT
[1:12:46] THIS MORNING. GOD DIDN'T LEAVE US IN THE
[1:12:48] BROKEN STATE THAT WE WERE IN. HOW HE
[1:12:51] FOUND US, HE RESTORED US BACK TO FULL
[1:12:54] HEALTH AGAIN.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES YOU RAN FROM
[1:12:58] GOD, HE WAS THERE TO BRING YOU BACK
[1:13:01] AGAIN. IF YOU'RE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF
[1:13:03] GOD, HE WILL BRING YOU BACK AGAIN.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; That's it, preacher.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Mercy.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; BUT MERCY GIVES YOU WHAT YOU DIDN'T
[1:13:20] EARN.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank God for that.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; I thank GOD THAT I DON'T HAVE TO EARN
[1:13:28] IT.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; That I don't have to work for it, but he
[1:13:31] he gives it unconditionally.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; MERCY OPENS DOORS YOU DIDN'T DESERVE IT.
[1:13:38] It gives you blessings.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; It gives you strength.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; When people ask, "BROTHER KOBE, HOW HOW
[1:13:45] DID YOU SURVIVE? HOW HOW DID YOU CHANGE?
[1:13:49] How how DID YOU GET FREE OF THE
[1:13:51] ADDICTIONS that you were in? HOW DID YOU
[1:13:53] RISE ABOVE YOUR PAST? YOUR ANSWER IS
[1:13:56] MERCY.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; It's
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; It's mercy.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; It's God's mercy.
[1:14:09] REMEMBER, OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS WAS AS
[1:14:12] FILTHY RAGS UNTO GOD.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But it was mercy that has clothed
[1:14:17] you with a new garment today.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; I know this is simple.
[1:14:24] We can see that mercy has also
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; cancelled what the enemy had planned for
[1:14:29] you as well.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; The devil planned to turn you into an
[1:14:33] addict here this morning. HE HE PLANNED
[1:14:35] TO DESTROY YOUR MIND. HE HE PLANNED TO
[1:14:38] KEEP YOU BOUND. HE HE PLANNED TO BREAK
[1:14:40] UP THAT FAMILY, BUT MERCY SAID NO.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:14:49] Mercy also gives you a a new identity.
[1:14:55] MERCY SAYS YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT YOUR past
[1:14:57] anymore.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; You're not your mistakes. YOU'RE YOU'RE
[1:15:01] NOT your failures. You're you're you're
[1:15:03] YOU'RE NOT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU IN
[1:15:05] YOUR LIFE.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; BUT IT SAYS YOU are forgiven. That's
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; You are loved even when the devil tells
[1:15:13] you that you're not.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE CHOSEN. THANK GOD FOR BEING
[1:15:18] CHOSEN here this morning. YOU'RE YOU'RE
[1:15:20] ACCEPTED.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU IN NO MATTER THE
[1:15:23] MISTAKE.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Mercy has given you a new name here this
[1:15:28] morning.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Mercy gives you a testimony.
[1:15:39] You could say, "I shouldn't have been
[1:15:41] here.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; I shouldn't have MADE IT.
[1:15:46] I SHOULDN'T BE FREE,
[1:15:49] but mercy has given you a testimony
[1:15:51] saying, "I'm here anyway."
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. I SHOULDN'T BE FREE, BUT
[1:15:59] MERCY SAYS YOU'RE FREE.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; That's it, brother.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; If I can say this,
[1:16:08] mercy fuels your worship here this
[1:16:10] morning.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; that's true. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO
[1:16:13] UNDERSTAND WOR mercy worship
[1:16:16] differently.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; That's very true.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Someone that WAS ONCE BOUND HAS NOW BEEN
[1:16:24] SET FREE CAN WORSHIP A LITTLE BIT
[1:16:27] DIFFERENTLY THAN THE ONE THAT IS STILL
[1:16:28] BOUND BECAUSE THE ONE THAT'S BOUND HAS
[1:16:31] NEVER EXPERIENCED WHAT GOD CAN DO IN
[1:16:33] YOUR LIFE. BUT THE ONE THAT WAS bound
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; and THE ONE THAT GOD HAS SET FREE CAN
[1:16:39] LIFT UP THEIR HANDS and sing a LITTLE
[1:16:42] BIT DIFFERENTLY
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE CAN SEE WHERE GOD HAS BROUGHT
[1:16:46] US FROM.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW THE THE THE THE THE
[1:16:49] deliverances that has taken PLACE IN OUR
[1:16:51] LIFE. WE OUGHT TO WORSHIP GOD WITH ALL
[1:16:54] THAT WE HAVE EVERY DAY THAT WE GET UP.
[1:16:58] WE OUGHT TO PRAISE GOD LIKE WE'VE NEVER
[1:17:00] HAD BEFORE BECAUSE HIS MERCY IS
[1:17:03] EVERLASTING AND IT'S NEW EVERY MORNING.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's so true.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:17:15] We can say great is thy faithfulness, oh
[1:17:19] Lord.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; We see that God links mercy to his
[1:17:23] faithfulness.
[1:17:26] And God is faithful when we've been
[1:17:29] unfaithful.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Very true.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; God is faithful when we were strong and
[1:17:35] when we were weak.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; When you're consistent, God has been
[1:17:41] faithful.
[1:17:44] When you're struggling, God is still
[1:17:46] faithful.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And we see that the sun rises every
[1:17:50] morning because
[1:17:53] God is more faithful than that sunrise.
[1:17:56] We can expect that sunrise to come up
[1:17:58] every day, can't we?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; It's consistent.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And we understand that God is more
[1:18:03] faithful than that sunrise.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; And we see that seasons never fail.
[1:18:09] It's consistent every year. But neither
[1:18:11] does God.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Can someone tell me when God has ever
[1:18:19] failed anyone? Anyone tell me, has God
[1:18:20] ever failed you?
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Has God ever let you down? HAS
[1:18:26] GOD EVER HAS GOD NEVER BEEN THERE FOR
[1:18:29] YOU IN YOUR TIME of need?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; THEN WE CAN SAY THAT GOD'S faithfulness
[1:18:38] is never changing.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; He is consistent time in and time out.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Ain't that IS THAT OKAY?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCES WHERE FAMILY
[1:18:50] HAS FAILED AND FRIENDS HAVE FAILED, BUT
[1:18:52] GOD HAS NEVER FAILED.
[1:18:55] AND BECAUSE OF THAT, MERCY SHOULD GIVE
[1:18:57] YOU CONFIDENCE HERE THIS MORNING.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD GIVE YOU A BOLDNESS TO STAND
[1:19:03] UP AND SAY, "BECAUSE GOD HAS NEVER
[1:19:05] FAILED, I CAN FACE TODAY WITH ASURANCES
[1:19:08] THAT GOD will bring me through one more
[1:19:10] day.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; I CAN FACE TODAY. I CAN RISE AGAIN. I I
[1:19:15] CAN WALK IN VICTORY. I I CAN BELIEVE FOR
[1:19:17] MY FAMILY. I I can believe for my
[1:19:19] healing." That's what I love ABOUT MY
[1:19:21] GRANDPA SO MUCH. HE'S BEEN DEALING WITH
[1:19:23] THIS Parkinson's for many, many years,
[1:19:26] and he still counts God faithful.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; He knows AND HE'S BELIEVING THAT IF GOD
[1:19:31] HEALED HIM ONCE BEFORE, HE can do it
[1:19:34] again.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER SEEN GO GRANDPA EVER COMPLAIN
[1:19:39] ABOUT HIS CONDITION.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW HARD HE'S TRYING TO TALK
[1:19:43] AND TRYING TO BREATHE, HE STILL COUNTS
[1:19:46] GOD FAITHFUL.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; HE STILL BELIEVES THAT GOD IS A HEALER.
[1:19:50] AND THAT'S THE WAY WE SHOULD FEEL EVERY
[1:19:52] DAY. WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE GETTING OUT OF
[1:19:54] BED.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE COMING TO CHURCH.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE WE FIGHT THAT EVERY
[1:20:05] SERVICE.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE PRAISING THE LORD,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; but it's amazing the effort that YOU PUT
[1:20:14] IN,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; HOW GOD WILL REWARD THAT EFFORT.
[1:20:20] That's true.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Very true.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay here this morning.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, why don't
[1:20:33] he? He wants to. He is willing to. He is
[1:20:36] waiting. Well, you see, I've asked him
[1:20:38] so many times. I just hate to ask him
[1:20:41] too much. Ask abundance that your joys
[1:20:44] might be full. Could you imagine a
[1:20:47] little fish a half inch long out in the
[1:20:49] middle of the Pacific saying, "I better
[1:20:51] drink this water sparingly. I might run
[1:20:54] out someday." Oh my. Could you think of
[1:20:56] that little mouse about that big in the
[1:20:59] great garners of Egypt, thinking, "I'll
[1:21:01] allow myself one grain a day." Cause I
[1:21:04] might run out before the next harvest
[1:21:06] comes in. Oh my.
[1:21:09] Now divide that by a hundred billion and
[1:21:12] that's how easy you can exhaust God's
[1:21:14] mercy and grace to you.
[1:21:16] If you just believe it, you can just
[1:21:18] leave yourself. Well, I'm sorry. He says
[1:21:20] that you can't exhaust him. HE IS THE
[1:21:23] INEXHAUSTIBLE FOUNTAIN OF ETERNAL LIFE
[1:21:26] here today to make manifest every divine
[1:21:28] promise of his Bible to anybody that
[1:21:32] will believe it. How many believers do
[1:21:33] we have here tonight?
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "Yes, sir. The only
[1:21:38] thing you can do is drink. Come to the
[1:21:40] fountain," he says, and drink. Drink
[1:21:42] until you're satisfied because you can't
[1:21:45] exhaust him. No sir. He is absolutely
[1:21:48] the inexhaustible and you can just drink
[1:21:51] and drink and drink. You can drink your
[1:21:53] healing in. You can drink your salvation
[1:21:55] and just come and drink. Let him that's
[1:21:58] thirsty come and drink. He said, "I know
[1:22:01] he is here and I know he'll do
[1:22:03] exceedingly more abundantly if we just
[1:22:06] let him
[1:22:08] do it."
[1:22:10] Lamentations 3 and22 says, "It is the
[1:22:13] Lord's mercies
[1:22:15] that we are not consumed
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; because his compassions fadeth not. They
[1:22:21] are new
[1:22:23] every morning."
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; As our musicians come here tonight, I
[1:22:27] pray this was okay. I
[1:22:29] wanted to keep it short and simple, but
[1:22:32] I wanted us to understand that his
[1:22:33] mercies
[1:22:35] are never failing.
[1:22:38] So glad for that. So glad God is not
[1:22:41] like humanity that
[1:22:44] up and down constantly.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; But God's mercy and his love
[1:22:54] thinking about my life and
[1:22:58] what I've been through and what I have
[1:23:00] today.
[1:23:02] It's not by what I could do, but
[1:23:05] it's by God's mercy.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; The beautiful family that I have today.
[1:23:20] It's God's mercy.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; I think we can all feel that way here
[1:23:24] this morning. We don't we don't deserve
[1:23:27] to have what we have.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; True. But it's the mercy of God that has
[1:23:33] smiled upon you,
[1:23:37] that has given you something that you
[1:23:39] didn't deserve. Yet God looked past that
[1:23:41] and said, "I'll give it to you anyway."
[1:23:46] Heavenly Father, we humbly come before
[1:23:50] you,
[1:23:52] Lord. I know it was very simple and
[1:23:54] short this morning, but Lord, this is
[1:23:57] what you placed on my heart early this
[1:23:59] morning.
[1:24:01] While I was drinking my coffee, Lord,
[1:24:03] you
[1:24:04] begin
[1:24:07] to let me know that your mercies are new
[1:24:10] every morning.
[1:24:12] That your compassions they fail not.
[1:24:18] Lord, I wanted to come out today and
[1:24:20] just betray my heart. Lord,
[1:24:25] let the people know
[1:24:29] that your mercies are new every morning.
[1:24:33] Father, I pray that you be with your
[1:24:34] people here today as they so faithfully
[1:24:37] have come.
[1:24:40] Pray Lord that
[1:24:42] you'll anoint each one. Father,
[1:24:46] encourage the discouraged here this
[1:24:48] morning. Lord,
[1:24:51] the sick and afflicted, heal them.
[1:24:53] Father,
[1:24:55] every chain here this morning, Lord, may
[1:24:56] it be broken.
[1:24:59] We love you, Lord.
[1:25:01] In your name we pray.
[1:25:04] Amen. And amen. What are you playing?
[1:25:09] Huh?
[1:25:11] Mercy said no.
[1:25:14] I'm not going to let you go.
[1:25:19] I'm not going to let you slip away. You
[1:25:23] don't have to be afraid.
[1:25:26] Mercy said no.
[1:25:30] Sin will never take control.
[1:25:36] Life and death stood face to face.
[1:25:40] Darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[1:25:46] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[1:25:49] Mercy. Can we go up a key?
[1:25:54] Mercy said, "Oh,
[1:25:57] I'm not going to let you go.
[1:26:01] I'm not going to let you slip away. You
[1:26:05] don't have to be afraid.
[1:26:08] Mercy said no.
[1:26:12] Sin will never take control.
[1:26:17] Oh, life and death stood face to face.
[1:26:21] Darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[1:26:27] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[1:26:30] Mercy said no. Sing that again now. Oh,
[1:26:34] mercy said no.
[1:26:38] I'm not going to let you go.
[1:26:42] I'm not going to let you slip away.
[1:26:47] Thank you, Lord. Oh, mercy said, "Oh,
[1:26:52] sin will never take control."
[1:26:58] Oh, life and death to face to face.
[1:27:02] Darkness try steal my heart away.
[1:27:08] Thank you Jesus.
[1:27:11] Mercy said no.
[1:27:16] Oh morning
[1:27:20] I see you in the sunrise
[1:27:23] every morning.
[1:27:27] It's like a picture that you paint it
[1:27:31] for
[1:27:33] me.
[1:27:36] Love letter in the sky. Story. Oh,
[1:27:42] story.
[1:27:46] I could have had a really different
[1:27:50] story.
[1:27:54] you from heaven to restore
[1:27:59] me
[1:28:02] forever.
[1:28:04] Change my life.
[1:28:09] Nobody loves me like you. Love me Jesus.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Amazing
[1:28:21] way.
[1:28:24] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[1:28:31] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[1:28:36] loves me like you. Mountains,
[1:28:40] oh mountains,
[1:28:43] singing now as brother Merl comes.
[1:28:46] the weight of every mountain.
[1:28:52] Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Surrounded.
[1:29:00] You never leave my side. Everybody now,
[1:29:04] nobody loves me. Oh, oh, nobody loves me
[1:29:09] like
[1:29:18] Sing ways
[1:29:21] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[1:29:28] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[1:29:33] loves me like you. Sing it again.
[1:29:39] Nobody loves me like you. Love me,
[1:29:44] Jesus.
[1:29:46] I stand in awe of your amazing
[1:29:51] ways.
[1:29:53] I worship you as long as I am redeemed.
[1:30:00] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[1:30:05] loves me like you.
[1:30:10] Can the redeemed say so this morning?
[1:30:14] Do you have a testimony of his mercy?
[1:30:20] Every son and daughter of God has a
[1:30:23] testimony,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; of his grace and mercy. Amen. I know it
[1:30:28] wasn't very long this morning, but it
[1:30:30] was powerful. It's not in the quantity,
[1:30:34] it's in the quality of the message
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; of the hour. I know brother Brandham
[1:30:41] preached a lot of long sermons, but
[1:30:42] there was a reason for that, too. He had
[1:30:45] a lot to say. He had a lot to restore.
[1:30:48] Amen. But I'm I'm thankful for Brother
[1:30:51] Kobe and his message this morning.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of a song Gordon Mo talked
[1:30:56] about the preacher that it was long-
[1:30:58] winded, but one morning, Sunday morning,
[1:31:00] he got up and said, "Love, love, love."
[1:31:05] And he sat back down.
[1:31:08] Amen.
[1:31:11] That's what he was led to tell the
[1:31:13] people. Amen. What something they I'm
[1:31:16] sure they lacked. Amen. Oh, how Jesus
[1:31:19] said, "I would that you would love one
[1:31:21] another." Amen. That all men may know
[1:31:24] you're my disciples.
[1:31:26] Amen. So appreciate that, Brother Kobe.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] You know,
[1:31:36] I don't think God's going to at the at
[1:31:38] the great white throne judgment and and
[1:31:41] every person that's a sinner goes, "You
[1:31:43] did this, you did that, you sinned here,
[1:31:47] and you sinned there,
[1:31:49] and that's why I'm sending you in hell."
[1:31:52] I I don't think it's the way it's going
[1:31:53] to be
[1:31:55] because we've all sinned and come short
[1:31:57] of the glory of God. I think he's what
[1:32:00] he's going to say is why didn't you
[1:32:02] accept my mercy?
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Why didn't you accept my grace?
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; But you turned it down.
[1:32:15] I'm so glad I received his mercy and his
[1:32:17] grace. Amen.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Just in in flesh. They brought a woman
[1:32:23] to him that is was caught in the very
[1:32:26] act. Now, I don't know why they didn't
[1:32:28] bring the man because the law said you
[1:32:31] bring both of them
[1:32:33] and they both get stoned.
[1:32:36] Why did they just bring the woman?
[1:32:41] So, we've caught her in the very act.
[1:32:44] The law says stone her,
[1:32:50] right?
[1:32:52] Jesus
[1:32:53] just kneel down.
[1:32:57] wrote in the sand or the ground.
[1:33:02] No one knows what he wrote. I guess I
[1:33:05] don't know if Brother Brandham ever
[1:33:07] mentioned it.
[1:33:11] But he said, "He that's without sin cast
[1:33:14] the first stone."
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, you you you priests and you
[1:33:20] righteous Pharisees.
[1:33:24] I'm thinking that he he might have wrote
[1:33:26] the names of the the women that they had
[1:33:30] been with.
[1:33:32] Wonder that if that's what he wrote.
[1:33:34] They could see wrote Elizabeth or
[1:33:37] whoever.
[1:33:39] No wonder
[1:33:42] they dropped their stones and walked
[1:33:44] away. He revealed their sin
[1:33:48] because they weren't righteous either.
[1:33:50] None of us are righteous. And what did
[1:33:52] he do when he turned to the woman?
[1:33:55] Woman, where are your accusers?
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; She said, "I don't have any."
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither do I condemn thee.
[1:34:11] Go and sin no more."
[1:34:14] That's what he told me. "Neither do I
[1:34:18] condemn you. go and sin no more because
[1:34:21] you've accepted my mercy and grace. Can
[1:34:23] you give him a praise THIS MORNING? OH,
[1:34:26] IT OUGHT to mean more to you than than
[1:34:29] life.
[1:34:31] Amen. God's mercy. Amen. I pray we don't
[1:34:35] forget it, brother Harry. Amen. His
[1:34:38] mercy and his grace. And if he's been
[1:34:40] merciful to you and gracious to the you,
[1:34:43] you can you can be to somebody else.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's those that are bitter and
[1:34:49] hard and cold. That's the ones God
[1:34:52] doesn't like.
[1:34:54] Forgive one another. Amen. It's hard.
[1:34:58] It's hard for one human to forgive
[1:34:59] another human. I know because I've had
[1:35:03] things done to me and I've done things
[1:35:04] to other people. Amen. But I'm thankful
[1:35:08] for his mercy. Can you give him one more
[1:35:10] praise? Thank you, Lord, for your mercy.
[1:35:15] Amen.
[1:35:16] So, I I had this song in my heart and I
[1:35:19] just opened up my song book. Amen. Like
[1:35:21] I open up my Bible sometimes when
[1:35:23] brother Randle turn says turn to uh book
[1:35:27] chapter verse and I my wife knows this.
[1:35:30] I open up my Bible and it's right there.
[1:35:35] That's his mercy. Amen. Like how did I
[1:35:38] turn to the exact scripture and it's
[1:35:41] happened like what 10 times?
[1:35:44] I think, oh, thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:35:47] That'd be so mindful of me. But I opened
[1:35:49] up my song book and I had this whole
[1:35:51] chorus on my heart and it I just opened
[1:35:53] right to it. Like, thy loving kindness
[1:35:56] is better than life. Let's try it this
[1:35:58] morning. Maybe uh D or F.
[1:36:04] Thy loving kindness
[1:36:09] is better than life. Oh, I might dance

[1:37:37] I'll lift up my hands. Oh, I lift my
[1:37:41] hands, Lord,
[1:37:43] unto thy name.
[1:37:47] I lift my hands, Lord,
[1:37:51] unto thy name. How about it, Brother
[1:37:53] Joe? My lips shall praise thee,
[1:37:58] thus will I bless thee.
[1:38:02] I will lift up my hands in thy name.
[1:38:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:16] Amen.
[1:38:18] Well, God bless each and every one of
[1:38:20] you. Amen. I pray that you were blessed
[1:38:23] this morning. Amen. I know he'll give us
[1:38:26] above all we can even ask or think.

[1:38:39] And uh I thought, what does that mean? X
[1:38:43] toll. E X T O L. And so I thought I knew
[1:38:47] what it meant, but I wasn't sure. And it
[1:38:49] means to praise. Anybody knows what it
[1:38:52] means?
[1:38:54] To praise enthusiastically.
[1:38:58] I thought that was wonderful. Amen. And
[1:39:02] on down there, he talked about thy
[1:39:03] loving kindness and everything. It's
[1:39:05] just not to just, oh, you know, lift up
[1:39:09] my hands. It's to praise
[1:39:11] enthusiastically.

[1:39:17] returned. And uh my what a type that the
[1:39:21] that the ark has been returned that

[1:41:48] day. We have a verse

[1:42:00] to me.
[1:42:02] He has opened
[1:42:05] my eyes

[1:42:15] is becoming
[1:42:17] a reality
[1:42:22] on this day.
[1:42:25] This glory.
