[44:41] sure thankful that everything went so
[44:42] well amen been been wonderful now it
[44:46] this is going to be uh quite a reading
[44:48] but I I want to read all the way the the
[44:51] third chapter from verse 1 to verse
[44:54] 15 and I brethren
[44:57] could not speak unto you as unto
[45:00] spiritual but as unto carnal even as
[45:03] babes in Christ I have fed you with milk
[45:06] and not with meat for hitherto you were
[45:10] not able to Bear it neither yet now are
[45:13] ye able for ye are yet carnal for
[45:17] whereas there is among you envying and
[45:20] strife and divisions are ye not carnal
[45:23] and walk as men and while one saith I am
[45:26] of Paul and another I'm of Apollos are
[45:30] ye not carnal who then is Paul who is
[45:34] Apollos for but ministers by whom ye
[45:37] believed even as the lord gave to every
[45:40] man I have planted Apollos watered but
[45:44] God gave the
[45:46] increase now and so then neither is he
[45:50] that planteth anything neither he that
[45:53] WTH but God that giveth the increase now
[45:57] he that planteth and he that WTH are one
[46:00] every man shall receive his own reward
[46:03] according to his own labor for we are
[46:05] laborers together with Christ ye are
[46:08] God's
[46:09] husbandry ye are God's Building
[46:12] according to the grace of God which is
[46:14] given unto me as a wise master builder I
[46:17] have laid the foundation and another man
[46:20] builth there on but let every man take
[46:24] heed how he build thereupon now if any
[46:27] man build upon this Foundation gold
[46:30] silver precious stones wood hay stubble
[46:35] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[46:39] for the day shall declare it because it
[46:41] shall be revealed by fire and the fire
[46:44] shall try every man's work of what sort
[46:47] it is if any man's work abide which he
[46:50] hath built thereup he shall receive a
[46:53] reward if any man's work shall be burned
[46:57] he shall suffer loss but he himself
[47:00] shall be saved so uh yet so as by fire
[47:06] let's go to the Lord in prayer father we
[47:08] want to thank you today for your many
[47:11] blessings that you have given us Lord as
[47:14] we've sung the songs of Zion as your
[47:17] Grace has been here this
[47:19] morning Lord and this is a a wonderful
[47:22] morning more than just the than the
[47:25] resurrection Lord but a a a beautiful
[47:27] anniversary being celebrated here this
[47:30] morning Father we we thank you for
[47:33] eternal life and what it does in our in
[47:36] these bodies and the and the beauty of
[47:38] life that it gives our
[47:40] families we thank you for that and ask a
[47:43] blessing there upon brother Merl and
[47:45] sister
[47:46] Leah father we just ask Lord that you
[47:49] would help us as we have read your word
[47:52] Lord we ask that you would now just pull
[47:55] back the scales for from our spiritual
[47:57] eyes that we can behold you and see you
[48:01] Lord hear your words we love you Lord
[48:04] with all of our heart in the name of the
[48:07] Lord Jesus Christ can the church say
[48:10] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[48:14] seated amen I'd like to uh Minister this
[48:18] morning on
[48:21] character and growing in
[48:23] Grace and um um and I I thought we would
[48:28] uh just continue a little uh bit uh did
[48:31] you enjoy the the uh Wednesday
[48:35] night uh reading of the church age
[48:39] book I uh I I I have really enjoyed uh
[48:43] ministering and uh reading the church
[48:45] age book and and we talk about uh it was
[48:50] about the trials and the testings and
[48:52] and um and so I I wanted to just um
[48:56] maybe minut Minister a little bit more
[48:57] on character here this morning and God
[49:01] is looking for a matured bride now the
[49:07] reason that this is called the bride age
[49:10] is because amen it's not that we're the
[49:13] only bride that that we're the only ones
[49:16] that can call ourselves bride out of The
[49:18] Seven Ages amen but this is simply the
[49:22] time to where the bride has come of age
[49:26] she is is she's no longer immature but
[49:29] she has come to maturity to where the
[49:33] mature word of God can come to her and
[49:36] she will take that word amen apply that
[49:39] word in her life and of course Christ
[49:42] will come and will take her amen and
[49:47] raise all of the other bride members of
[49:49] all the other ages uh and and we will go
[49:52] in a Rapture in that great Resurrection
[49:55] so uh so we are living in this age of
[50:00] maturity amen now this is where the word
[50:03] has come to its final as a church as as
[50:06] a as a church as in general amen of the
[50:10] last 2,000 years we have come all the
[50:13] way up to this Pinnacle ready for a
[50:15] Rapture but it in this church amen even
[50:20] in this bright age there are there is
[50:23] still
[50:24] maturity that is required in every one
[50:27] of us we are all growing we are all
[50:30] maturing we are all amen uh we some of
[50:34] us may be at the baby stage some of us
[50:37] may be uh uh may maybe you're you're in
[50:41] kindergarten maybe maybe you're in uh uh
[50:45] maybe you're in high school you know may
[50:48] wherever you are we are all in this in
[50:51] this body here this morning this this uh
[50:54] Church Auditorium there there are uh uh
[50:58] a wide uh variety of growth amen and
[51:03] we're all at different stages in our
[51:05] walk with God Amen and so never be
[51:08] discouraged at what stage you are in but
[51:12] always be diligent for the tutor to to
[51:15] train you and always have that desire to
[51:18] come up higher in your walk with God
[51:22] Amen maturity it it means the state or
[51:26] fact or the period of being mature amen
[51:29] maturity is fully developed it means
[51:32] adulthood full growth the sense of
[51:36] responsibility level-headedness um re
[51:40] responsibleness wisdom adultness and so
[51:44] this is what Webster has for maturity so
[51:48] amen we the Apostle
[51:50] Paul was was telling this church he was
[51:54] he was just telling the the Corinthian
[51:57] churches we've just read amen there the
[52:01] time or I believe it was actually over
[52:03] in Hebrews that he was telling some of
[52:05] those the time that you should be
[52:07] teachers you have need to be taught all
[52:10] over again which is saying listen you're
[52:13] not taking your tutorage uh uh uh to to
[52:20] heart you're you're not taking the word
[52:22] of God you're not allowing the Holy
[52:24] Spirit to teach you the way that you
[52:27] should be taught and so he is saying now
[52:31] you you have need for someone to teach
[52:33] you all over again the very basics of
[52:36] the of the doctrines of Christ and as we
[52:40] looked here at the Corinthian Church
[52:43] amen we we find that the Apostle Paul
[52:46] was getting on to them and said listen
[52:49] you guys are just carnal you're just
[52:51] carnal there's a lot of ening there's a
[52:53] lot of uh uh malice you're you're
[52:56] debating over who's better Paul or
[52:58] Apollos you're you you've got you've
[53:01] you've got sin in the church I've had to
[53:04] rebuke you back and forth it's just you
[53:07] and and yet you are all claiming to be
[53:09] spiritual you speak in tongues you
[53:11] prophesy you're doing all of these
[53:13] things but I'm telling you right now
[53:14] Corinthian Church it is time to take off
[53:16] the Pampers and it's and it's time to be
[53:19] potty trained it's time to mature it's
[53:22] time to grow you you you you you have
[53:25] got God's got a specific purpose for you
[53:29] you've got to take this seriously and I
[53:33] I want I I I want the holy spirit amen
[53:36] to train me tutor me bring me into the
[53:41] maturity that that he wants me to
[53:44] be because every one of us are his genan
[53:47] seed and so as we begin I think every
[53:50] one of us are that way as as Believers
[53:53] we don't want to look back 6 months and
[53:56] uh from now and say I see no growth in
[53:59] my walk with God I don't want to look
[54:01] back last year at this same time and say
[54:04] I see no growth with God I want growth I
[54:07] want growth how many wants to grow in
[54:09] the Lord amen now amen uh uh brother
[54:12] Bram would say uh in the end time
[54:14] evangelism and and he would he would
[54:16] talk about and I would encourage
[54:18] everyone this week that that uh I I
[54:21] would encourage you to listen to end
[54:22] time evangelism and brother Bram was
[54:24] talking about the reasoning for the m
[54:26] message the message is being scattered
[54:28] out because there is a people that is
[54:32] that he is attracting he's the elaser
[54:36] trying to find a a a people who will
[54:39] hear that word and so he says God God's
[54:42] looking for character not membership but
[54:45] character elaser when he went to get the
[54:49] Bride of Isaac he sweated it out until
[54:52] he found character remember Abraham put
[54:55] him responsible as God puts us
[54:57] responsible that's right we ministers
[54:59] hunt my bride God bless your heart I
[55:02] ain't looking for members I'm looking
[55:05] for the pure in heart see somebody
[55:09] that'll believe the word amen he goes on
[55:12] down and says then when eleazer found
[55:15] the character that was in the the woman
[55:18] Rebecca uh the the beautiful bride of
[55:20] Isaac he told her about Isaac and she
[55:24] never questioned one thing amen I want
[55:27] you to get that she never questioned one
[55:29] thing she believed the word of the
[55:32] messenger she made ready to go and she
[55:36] went and asked the father or they went
[55:39] and asked the father and he said just
[55:41] ask her the damils of age ask her let
[55:44] her decision be and she said I will go
[55:48] to what a man that had a man she had
[55:50] never seen know nothing about but she
[55:54] was ready because she was
[55:57] predestinated and for ordained to that
[56:00] exactly right can you say amen amen so
[56:03] the the desire or the the craving the
[56:08] craving to grow is in the seed there's
[56:12] there's no way a church member is going
[56:14] to Crave to be more like Jesus Christ
[56:17] they they'll want positions they'll want
[56:20] these kinds of of things but only only
[56:24] the predestinated seed of Christ on the
[56:26] inside of the elect it craves to be more
[56:31] like Jesus Christ amen so Rebeca was
[56:36] predestinated to be the bride of Christ
[56:39] and when the word came to her she knew
[56:43] that there was something within her to
[56:46] respond to that word well glory to God
[56:50] Amen I love that song that brother
[56:52] leontine wrote I feel the pool amen
[56:56] there is something pulling me to a
[56:59] higher walk there's something pulling me
[57:01] to a higher praise there's something
[57:04] that's pulling me Amen to that deeper
[57:07] relationship with the Lord can you say
[57:09] Amen now brother Brandon would go on and
[57:11] he would say now the end time message is
[57:13] not to them that are in Babylon amen it
[57:16] is to the bride alone amen he's looking
[57:21] for the character of faith that will
[57:24] believe that one
[57:26] amen so he says one Angel he's talking
[57:29] about Abraham one Angel come to Abraham
[57:32] and his group on the mountain and
[57:34] performed a miracle by Discerning the
[57:36] thoughts that was in the heart is that
[57:38] right and Sarah was on the inside where
[57:42] where the angels that went to Sodom had
[57:45] thousands down there see the shaking
[57:48] comes in the little group he says going
[57:51] on further he says getting the bride
[57:54] ready that's what it is is now we're
[57:57] going to the end right here by saying
[58:00] that we're going to end right here by
[58:01] saying this the end time message is to
[58:05] get the bride ready and prepared for the
[58:09] Rapture amen so the reason we're coming
[58:11] to church is to get ourselves ready and
[58:16] prepared for the Rapture amen so simply
[58:19] believing the message doesn't make us
[58:21] Rapture Ready amen just uh uh uh
[58:24] Justified doesn't make us Rapture Ready
[58:27] Sanctified doesn't make us raptured
[58:29] ready but we the bride has made
[58:34] ourselves
[58:35] ready hallelujah amen it takes a matured
[58:38] individual to take the word of the Lord
[58:40] and say I'm going to take the word of
[58:43] God I'm going to apply it to my life and
[58:47] I'm going to make myself ready because I
[58:51] am his
[58:53] bride well glory to God amen so there is
[58:57] a certain
[58:59] quality uh uh of character of of the uh
[59:04] in the elect to believe that
[59:07] predestinated seed amen is what God is
[59:10] looking for now now when we talk about
[59:12] the predestinated seed we would have to
[59:15] go to Romans the 8th chapter and the
[59:16] 29th verse and he said whom he did for
[59:19] know and that word means before love
[59:23] them he also did predestinate to be
[59:27] conformed to the image of his son now
[59:30] that that simply means if he loved you
[59:33] and he called you you are
[59:37] predestinated to come to the full
[59:40] maturity that he has purposed in himself
[59:44] amen you're going to arrive can you say
[59:47] amen amen God's pred that you cannot you
[59:51] cannot expect uh uh the the church
[59:54] member to come and into that maturity
[59:57] you cannot expect a a a denominational
[1:00:00] system to bring you into that maturity
[1:00:03] only the elect can mature because only
[1:00:08] the elect has that predestinated seat
[1:00:12] whom he before loved them he also did
[1:00:16] predestinate to be conformed well glory
[1:00:19] to God Amen now now here we are you say
[1:00:22] now amen I was predestinated I was was
[1:00:26] called of God Amen but I I I but we were
[1:00:30] in sin and we were we were filthy and
[1:00:33] and we were you know you were
[1:00:35] predestinated even when you was out
[1:00:36] there in the
[1:00:37] world you were predestinated even when
[1:00:40] you were out there drinking and crowding
[1:00:42] and amen drunk as a skunk and and and
[1:00:45] you before you are even sitting in a
[1:00:47] church pew you were predestinated then
[1:00:50] but you have to have a call from God
[1:00:53] Amen brother brandham didn't he he said
[1:00:55] this he said the blood did not save you
[1:00:59] the Blood Washed you you were saved by
[1:01:05] predestination the blood is there the
[1:01:08] blood is shed Hallelujah but only the
[1:01:13] predestinated elected seat of God will
[1:01:16] do anything with that blood that's Oh
[1:01:20] Glory to God that makes me want to shout
[1:01:23] amen I you see the blood came for me to
[1:01:28] pull me out of the pig pin pull me out
[1:01:31] of sin pull me out of the muck and mire
[1:01:33] pull me out and to bring me into that
[1:01:36] position that he predestinated me to be
[1:01:39] and I want to tell you where you are
[1:01:41] right now is your is not exactly where
[1:01:43] God Wants You God's got a Destiny for
[1:01:46] you and you're going to keep on growing
[1:01:48] and maturing we're going to grow
[1:01:50] somebody say Let Me Grow amen I'm going
[1:01:54] to grow I'm going to continue to mature
[1:01:56] it don't matter where you are now in
[1:01:58] this walk there is a maturity that God
[1:02:01] is calling us
[1:02:03] to amen hallelujah so it's through that
[1:02:06] new birth that we can find now amen and
[1:02:09] and Christ reflected the heart of the
[1:02:12] father when in an identification he said
[1:02:15] you study that character a little bit
[1:02:18] and then look at yourself and I look at
[1:02:20] myself now now that's but but that's
[1:02:24] what he was that's who he was that's why
[1:02:28] he was now he said that's what he was
[1:02:30] that's who he was and that's why he was
[1:02:33] to save
[1:02:36] you I love that he says he become you
[1:02:39] that you might become him he took your
[1:02:42] load of sin therefore when we come to
[1:02:45] meet him we will not have to stand we
[1:02:48] could not stand in the presence of God
[1:02:50] there's no way for us to do it but when
[1:02:53] we stand in him he's already recognized
[1:02:55] the the sacrifice this is my beloved Son
[1:02:58] in whom I am well pleased he recognized
[1:03:00] it there was no blemish on him yet he
[1:03:03] suffered Temptation like every other man
[1:03:05] he was scorned he was made fun of he was
[1:03:07] persecuted from the hour that he was
[1:03:09] born until the hour he died yet he
[1:03:12] returned good for evil you cannot no way
[1:03:16] ever produce a character like that only
[1:03:20] accepting that character in you a church
[1:03:24] cannot do it a Creed cannot do that a
[1:03:27] denomination cannot do that education
[1:03:29] cannot do that it must be a birth it's
[1:03:32] got to be a dying out and let God in by
[1:03:36] the grace of Christ then mold this
[1:03:38] character this type of character in you
[1:03:41] that you become him your life and his is
[1:03:45] the same you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:03:49] God hallelujah hallelujah oh can you say
[1:03:52] Amen so it took now the predestin at
[1:03:56] seed was already there but it took God
[1:03:59] Amen Jesus was nothing but the character
[1:04:01] of God Amen he was the love of God he
[1:04:05] was the Divine Redeemer of God he was
[1:04:08] the Savior When God says there is no
[1:04:10] savior beside me it was God in Jesus
[1:04:14] Jesus was reflecting the savior he was
[1:04:18] reflecting the character of love he was
[1:04:21] reflecting the character of Grace when
[1:04:23] he came to you he was expressing and
[1:04:26] reflecting his love his eternal love for
[1:04:30] every one of
[1:04:31] you and then when he comes in what is he
[1:04:34] doing the Holy Spirit ignites the seed
[1:04:38] predestinated in your heart before the
[1:04:41] foundation of the world and you begin to
[1:04:43] live
[1:04:45] Hallelujah
[1:04:47] but now you've accepted that character
[1:04:50] in you but it's in seed form the seed is
[1:04:55] now living
[1:04:56] but now the seed must mature that's
[1:04:58] right because brother Brandon would go
[1:05:00] on and say amen he in in in that same uh
[1:05:04] uh uh the same message
[1:05:06] identification after Jesus doing this
[1:05:09] when no one else wouldn't could do it we
[1:05:12] are invited now the church think of this
[1:05:15] just a minute we are invited to shape
[1:05:19] our own character to his by his grace
[1:05:24] then he says again we are invited think
[1:05:28] of it to become character like his if
[1:05:32] we're ready to lay our character down
[1:05:35] and the molding that we had he
[1:05:37] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:05:40] lovers of God false accusers incontinent
[1:05:43] despisers of those that are trying to do
[1:05:45] right having a form of godliness and
[1:05:47] denying the power of God how can God
[1:05:50] come into a place like that when they
[1:05:52] deny the word see when he watches over
[1:05:55] for his word to vindicate it to make it
[1:05:58] come to pass and the word is pushed out
[1:06:02] how can he identify himself with
[1:06:04] something like that we've got to take
[1:06:06] the entire Full Gospel amen we must now
[1:06:10] being that we are identified ourselves
[1:06:14] as a Full Gospel people let's mold our
[1:06:18] character once again he says we are
[1:06:22] invited to be molded in His image that
[1:06:26] we might reflect his presence and the
[1:06:28] works that I do shall you do also and
[1:06:31] the life that I live so shall you we're
[1:06:34] invited by God to take him as an example
[1:06:39] and let our character be molded like his
[1:06:42] what a thing my then we when we let his
[1:06:47] character be in us then we have become
[1:06:50] uh Sons by having the mind of Christ
[1:06:53] which is his character your mind makes
[1:06:55] your character let the Mind Paul said of
[1:06:58] Christ this mind that was in Christ be
[1:07:02] in you let the mind of Christ be in you
[1:07:05] and it'll mold the character of a Son of
[1:07:09] God Amen it it'll mold the character so
[1:07:12] so now he the character of Christ came
[1:07:16] in us through the seed the seed was
[1:07:19] ignited then brother Brandon would say
[1:07:21] then you're invited to take on and to
[1:07:26] produce that character in you what are
[1:07:29] you doing you're taking the word of God
[1:07:31] Amen you're not just listening to it in
[1:07:33] a message form anymore but now you're
[1:07:35] taking those words that are coming
[1:07:37] across the pulpit and you're applying
[1:07:39] those things to your everyday walk amen
[1:07:42] you're not forgetting the sermon when
[1:07:44] you walk out now you're taking those
[1:07:46] things and you're going to prayer and
[1:07:48] you're saying God I'm asking that you
[1:07:50] mold my heart according to that word
[1:07:54] that I have re seed I'm asking well
[1:07:57] praise the Lord you see and it can be
[1:08:00] done it must be done because the seed
[1:08:03] that is that is being preached up here
[1:08:05] well the the word that's being preached
[1:08:07] up here amen is simply the rain to fall
[1:08:10] upon the seed that's already in your
[1:08:12] heart and when you accept it and you
[1:08:14] allow that word to water that seed it
[1:08:17] must produce of
[1:08:19] itself well are you are you are you
[1:08:22] catching my dri we want that word to
[1:08:25] bring that maturity amen now now we we
[1:08:30] there in in first or second uh Peter 3
[1:08:33] and 14 it says wherefore beloved seeing
[1:08:36] that ye look for such things be diligent
[1:08:39] that you may be found of him in peace
[1:08:42] without spot and blameless now now he's
[1:08:46] he's he's letting you know now there's
[1:08:48] going to be those if you were to read
[1:08:50] all of those verses there amen they're
[1:08:52] wrestling with the word here they're
[1:08:53] wrestling with what Paul said here
[1:08:55] they're doing it to their own
[1:08:56] destruction and he's saying I want you
[1:08:58] to be diligent to be found in him
[1:09:01] without spot and without blemish the
[1:09:04] 17th verse he says therefore beloved
[1:09:06] seeing you know these things before
[1:09:08] beware lest you also being aay with uh
[1:09:12] being led away with the error of the
[1:09:14] wicked fall from your own steadfastness
[1:09:17] but grow in
[1:09:21] Grace now Grace Can't grow Grace is the
[1:09:24] ultimate
[1:09:26] right what he's saying here I'm giving
[1:09:28] you God's given you a
[1:09:31] vehicle grow in Grace the seed is laying
[1:09:36] within you Grace is already been
[1:09:39] extended to you and through that Grace
[1:09:43] you can now
[1:09:45] grow these other guys are wrestling with
[1:09:48] the word and again I I don't have time
[1:09:50] because I've got a long message amen but
[1:09:52] but if you were to read if you were to
[1:09:53] read all the way down through uh through
[1:09:56] those four verses there he's talking
[1:09:58] about this one that is being led away
[1:10:00] this one's arguing with the word and
[1:10:02] that one's arguing with the word but
[1:10:04] he's saying but you have been given
[1:10:08] Grace grow in that Grace take advantage
[1:10:12] of that Grace there is light that has
[1:10:14] appeared to you they're living in
[1:10:16] darkness you're living in light and you
[1:10:19] can
[1:10:20] grow they don't have that opportunity
[1:10:23] because there is no seed laying on the
[1:10:27] inside of them but you are a royal
[1:10:31] priesthood you're a chosen generation

[1:15:26] have things to overcome now we can say
[1:15:30] these things in the word the word is
[1:15:33] there amen that has been given to us but
[1:15:37] if there's nothing to overcome then the
[1:15:40] word will really mean nothing to us the

[1:15:45] the preacher preach it and we amen and
[1:15:46] yeah yeah yeah yeah we believe it we
[1:15:48] believe it we believe it but unless
[1:15:50] there was a trial for us to go through
[1:15:53] then that word would never really be

[1:15:58] and then forgotten within a couple of
[1:16:00] days God don't want it here God wants it
[1:16:05] here well praise the Lord amen amen so

[1:16:32] need neither Barren nor unfruitful in

[1:16:42] verse but he he that lath these things
[1:16:48] is blind and cannot see a far off and

[1:17:05] that you can be partakers of his divine
[1:17:08] nature but if you are not diligent and

[1:21:49] now we've laid the
[1:21:51] foundation that the seed comes from God
[1:21:55] that election comes from God that it is
[1:21:59] all within us potential form through
[1:22:02] that seed but now is where it's supposed
[1:22:06] to be coming out and living its life
[1:22:08] through us right can you say Amen now
[1:22:11] there are the works of the flesh amen
[1:22:15] there're they're in in Galatians 5 and
[1:22:18] 23 amen if if you want to turn there uh
[1:22:22] uh there there is the the Works let's
[1:22:25] see
[1:22:27] um uh let's see uh five and um let's
[1:22:31] just 5 and 16
[1:22:35] amen uh let's see boy it's the whole the
[1:22:38] whole chapter is just really really good
[1:22:40] amen it it says um uh we we could even
[1:22:44] we could even go on up because it's
[1:22:45] dealing with the I want to deal with the
[1:22:47] lust of the flesh for just a moment um
[1:22:49] let let's look here at the 13th verse
[1:22:51] for Brethren uh ye have been called un
[1:22:54] Liberty only use not that Liberty for an
[1:22:57] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[1:23:00] one another for all the law is fulfilled
[1:23:01] in one word even in this Thou shalt love
[1:23:04] thy neighbor as thyself now remember we
[1:23:06] talked about the character of Christ the
[1:23:09] character of God that was in Christ that
[1:23:13] character is what Christ is looking for
[1:23:16] what is what God is wanting to see
[1:23:18] through you and me he's wanting to see
[1:23:21] that so he is the love of God Christ is
[1:23:25] so what Christ is doing now the Apostle
[1:23:27] Paul is bringing it out here in maturity
[1:23:31] he's he's showing us the difference amen
[1:23:33] remember Christ the the love uh the the
[1:23:37] law is fulfilled all in one word it's
[1:23:39] all summed up in one word love loving
[1:23:43] Christ loving God loving your neighbor
[1:23:46] can you say Amen now watch this he says
[1:23:48] the law is fulfilled even in this one
[1:23:50] word thou shalt love uh th like thyself
[1:23:53] as thy thy neighbor as thyself but if
[1:23:55] thou bow and devour one another take
[1:23:56] heed lest you be consumed with one one
[1:23:58] another this I say then walk in the
[1:24:00] spirit that you fulfill not the lust of
[1:24:02] the flesh for the lust of the for the
[1:24:04] flesh lusteth after the spirit the
[1:24:05] spirit after the Flesh and these are
[1:24:07] contrary the one to the other so that
[1:24:09] you cannot do things that you would but
[1:24:12] if you be led of the spirit ye are not
[1:24:14] under the law now the works of the flesh
[1:24:16] are manifest which are these adultery
[1:24:19] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[1:24:22] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[1:24:24] ulations wrath Strife seditions heresies
[1:24:27] ening murders drunkenness ra uh reings
[1:24:30] and such like of which I tell you before
[1:24:33] as I have also told you in times past
[1:24:36] that they which do such things shall not
[1:24:39] inherit the kingdom of God so within so
[1:24:42] you you have in your I in in your DNA in
[1:24:48] your fleshly DNA you have the works of
[1:24:53] the flesh am amen and that's the reason
[1:24:56] why the Apostle Paul says You Must Die
[1:25:00] daily Paul says I Die daily so so what
[1:25:05] what am I now I am not saying that that
[1:25:08] it is a mind over matter mind over
[1:25:09] matter is will never bring maturity
[1:25:11] it'll never bring maturity I heard
[1:25:13] someone say one time well you know uh
[1:25:15] that you know there talking about you
[1:25:17] know makeup and things and and uh he
[1:25:19] just he's talking about Sin and how you
[1:25:20] know brother brandham shouldn't have
[1:25:21] been you know talking about those uh
[1:25:24] pain face Jezebels and and Miss dog meat

[1:25:29] he says he says I know our girls that
[1:25:31] got blue stuff on their on their eyes
[1:25:33] and they've got you know the makeup and
[1:25:35] things like that he says but they'll
[1:25:36] grow out of that now now listen you
[1:25:39] don't grow out of sin oh come on you
[1:25:42] must cut sin off in your life you've got
[1:25:46] to cut sin off somebody say cut sin off

[1:25:58] that wants to please God that wants to
[1:26:01] serve God you've got to have a nature
[1:26:04] and that can only come by a
[1:26:07] predestinated seat that has been found
[1:26:09] of Life by
[1:26:12] God hallelujah can you say

[1:26:37] Believer will choose God's
[1:26:40] word hallelujah the character that God
[1:26:45] is looking for is for that man that
[1:26:48] woman that will base every action upon
[1:26:53] thus saith the Lord Lord

[1:27:16] character that God is bringing about in

[1:27:49] to have to end up coming to you've got
[1:27:51] to come to this knowledge every
[1:27:55] way of a man is right if you want to put
[1:27:58] it back up Proverbs 21 and2 every man
[1:28:02] every way of a man is right in his own
[1:28:05] eyes right everybody say every way of a
[1:28:09] man is right in his own
[1:28:12] eyes every way of a
[1:28:14] man is right in his own
[1:28:17] eyes and if you are going to walk
[1:28:20] according to what that truth is then you
[1:28:23] will never except amen the character
[1:28:26] that says God Ponders the
[1:28:32] hearts you see we want to
[1:28:35] defend what we think is right too many
[1:28:39] times we are wanting to
[1:28:42] justify where we are too many times and
[1:28:47] God may
[1:28:48] be Hallelujah he may be trying to get
[1:28:52] you out of that crawling St stage and
[1:28:54] into the walking
[1:28:57] stage but because you don't want to walk
[1:29:00] and you would rather crawl amen and
[1:29:03] God's picking you up and you just want
[1:29:05] to sit back down and throw your little
[1:29:07] temper tantrum why because your way in
[1:29:10] your eyes is right but God says no I'm
[1:29:14] taking you a little bit
[1:29:17] higher come on it's time for you to
[1:29:19] learn to walk Come
[1:29:22] onlj could you imagine all of these
[1:29:24] beautiful girls up here amen still in
[1:29:26] diapers and having to crawl their way up

[1:29:39] can you say Amen it's part of growing
[1:29:44] up and God is calling the church it's in
[1:29:49] your DNA to rule it's in your DNA to
[1:29:54] bring your flesh under control it's in
[1:29:57] your DNA to conquer the devil you can do

[1:30:21] drink I don't cuss I don't
[1:30:24] whatever so that's
[1:30:27] character brother brandham would
[1:30:30] say it's the state of the heart he says
[1:30:33] most people say well he's a good man
[1:30:35] Pays His ties he's a good member that's
[1:30:38] very good he says that's a moral life
[1:30:42] now no one could speak evil of that it's
[1:30:43] a moral life but that's not what I'm
[1:30:47] talking
[1:30:48] about Jesus judged a man a Believer a
[1:30:52] different type
[1:30:54] of character
[1:30:57] yeah amen he would say it shows what's

[1:31:15] not that we go to church pay our ti do
[1:31:19] this our character is where is is where
[1:31:24] the root system is it's where it's where
[1:31:27] our heart is it's what we
[1:31:29] think and because we think we're better
[1:31:32] than everyone else then we can talk
[1:31:34] about everybody else and because we
[1:31:36] think that we're better than oh yeah we
[1:31:38] say oh no we're humble we think we're
[1:31:40] better that's the reason we can just go

[1:45:25] trust comes we go through the trials and
[1:45:29] we those who
[1:45:32] have found a total surrendered heart to
[1:45:37] the
[1:45:40] Potter the design of the Masterpiece is
[1:45:42] in The Potter's hands yes
[1:45:46] so whatever he's building he knows what
[1:45:48] he's making he knows what he's wanting
[1:45:51] he knows the pressure that is
[1:45:55] needed and he has the
[1:45:58] patience at the task at
[1:46:02] hand so if you're looking at me while
[1:46:06] I'm on the potter's
[1:46:10] wheel and you're going to see me in my
[1:46:16] unfinished
[1:46:17] State you're going to be so disappointed
[1:46:20] in me that's right all right but if you

[1:46:25] look through the power of the Holy
[1:46:28] Spirit Through The Eyes the mind of
[1:46:30] Christ look through the
[1:46:33] eyes of the
[1:46:35] Potter amen he
[1:46:39] knows what he's
[1:46:42] doing that's right that's good in
[1:46:46] me there you go when you don't see it
[1:46:50] when you don't know it
[1:46:53] he never takes his eyes off of the
[1:46:55] Potter or off the Clay he never come on
[1:46:59] church and I guarantee you this year he
[1:47:01] never throws the Clay Away he might have
[1:47:05] to break you back down he might have to
[1:47:06] put you back in the on the on on the on
[1:47:09] the potter's wheel he might have to do
[1:47:10] those kinds of things again can you say
[1:47:12] amen amen but I just want you to
[1:47:14] remember there in first Ephesians 1:1 in
[1:47:17] whom we have obtained an inheritance
[1:47:19] being predestinated somebody say being
[1:47:22] predes
[1:47:23] destinated read it with me according to
[1:47:26] the purpose of him who worketh all
[1:47:31] things after the counsel of his own will
[1:47:35] we have been predestinated according to
[1:47:38] the purpose of him who works all things
[1:47:41] according to the counsel of his own will
[1:47:43] let's go to the next verse and then it
[1:47:45] says and read it with me that we should
[1:47:48] be to the praise of his glory
[1:47:54] Hallelujah really I thought y'all was
[1:47:56] going to get up and do a jig on that one
[1:47:59] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:48:09] glory he's predestinated
[1:48:13] us he's going to bring us
[1:48:15] out he's going to show his purpose
[1:48:20] right amen 1 Peter 1 and six we're in
[1:48:25] you greatly Rejoice though
[1:48:28] now for a season if need be you're in
[1:48:31] heaviness through manifold
[1:48:33] Temptations the trial of your
[1:48:36] faith being much more precious than of
[1:48:40] gold that
[1:48:42] perisheth though it be Tried by
[1:48:46] fire might be
[1:48:48] found unto
[1:48:51] praise and honor
[1:48:53] and
[1:48:54] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:48:58] now now now remember what I just read to
[1:49:00] you there in Ephesians 1 being
[1:49:02] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:49:03] of him who have worked all things
[1:49:05] according to the counsel of his own will
[1:49:06] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:49:08] glory now he's saying though the trial
[1:49:12] of your faith is much more precious than
[1:49:14] of go that prish that perisheth though
[1:49:17] it be tried with fire that it might be
[1:49:19] unto praise honor and Glory how is he
[1:49:21] going to take you to the honor the
[1:49:23] praise the glory it's going to go
[1:49:25] through the
[1:49:29] fire it's in the
[1:49:32] fire that's in the fire is where the
[1:49:36] humble
[1:49:39] soft malleable beginnings of the
[1:49:45] clay are transformed into the new
[1:49:48] durable
[1:49:50] substance that becomes indestructive
[1:49:54] in the fire in the fire is
[1:50:00] where the soft clay that can be easily
[1:50:04] messed up that can be
[1:50:06] easily in the fire is
[1:50:10] where the transformation takes place in
[1:50:13] the
[1:50:14] fire if you're looking at today's
[1:50:16] Ceramics they're tough and they're
[1:50:19] strong amen they're similar to to that
[1:50:22] of a
[1:50:23] Stone because the clay came in contact
[1:50:27] with
[1:50:28] fire that's good come on there are
[1:50:30] pieces of potery that have survived for
[1:50:33] thousands of years thousands of years
[1:50:37] because the clay came in
[1:50:41] contact with the
[1:50:44] fire that's good sometimes we're looking
[1:50:48] and we're not wondering we're we're not
[1:50:49] understanding what the fire is we don't
[1:50:51] understand we're trying to get out of
[1:50:52] the
[1:50:53] fire but God's molding you
[1:50:56] Hallelujah and he's not wanting you to
[1:50:58] be here just today and going
[1:51:02] tomorrow but the artifacts that we could
[1:51:04] see from thousands of years ago is
[1:51:07] because somebody took a piece of clay
[1:51:11] Hallelujah and they put it in the fire
[1:51:14] and the fire gave them a resilience the
[1:51:17] fire made them indestructible thousands
[1:51:20] of years later we're digging them up
[1:51:22] come
[1:51:26] on don't ever don't you don't you ever
[1:51:30] get discouraged in your
[1:51:35] training God's calling us to
[1:51:38] maturity and maturity can only
[1:51:42] come through the
[1:51:44] fire amen yes
[1:51:47] sir now in recent times we've had the
[1:51:52] the Kel the Kiln and the bricks the
[1:51:55] ancient times they were sundried and and
[1:51:58] though it worked for the time the bricks
[1:51:59] were not strong end
[1:52:01] durable but when the Kiln was
[1:52:06] invented this was a major advancement in
[1:52:09] in the ancient
[1:52:11] technology and it revolutionized the
[1:52:14] process
[1:52:16] because it provided a stronger brick so
[1:52:19] the brick kle today it it it it's hard
[1:52:22] they they they that they they make rocks
[1:52:24] they make the brick they make and it and
[1:52:26] it's just as hard as a rock as you as
[1:52:27] get as you as get out there in in in in
[1:52:30] their you know that you uncover from the
[1:52:32] earth makes them strong
[1:52:35] amen and
[1:52:37] and and it and it it's because of the
[1:52:40] heat
[1:52:41] process so a lot of the rock most of the
[1:52:44] rock that you see this this rock here is
[1:52:45] fake Rock Amen right is that fake that's
[1:52:49] not fake okay never mind that's not fake
[1:52:51] fck
[1:52:53] amen lot lot of a lot of that stuff
[1:52:56] today is is is is is is stuff that looks
[1:52:59] that looks good but they they've done it
[1:53:01] in the they've done it in the Kil
[1:53:04] and and and so but in in the Kil is
[1:53:08] where the the
[1:53:10] magic of pottery I'm glad we ain't got
[1:53:12] nothing fake in here amen the pottery uh
[1:53:16] uh is is uh is it's where it it's where
[1:53:21] it happens in the Kil is where the magic
[1:53:24] takes place amen it turns your raw work
[1:53:28] of art into a finished
[1:53:31] Masterpiece and there is the process of
[1:53:34] firing they call it the process of
[1:53:37] firing that turns the clay into
[1:53:42] Ceramics now the firing is the process
[1:53:45] of the
[1:53:46] clay and glazes it up to a to a high
[1:53:51] temperature and the final aim to is to
[1:53:56] heat this object to the
[1:53:58] point that the clay and the
[1:54:02] glaze are
[1:54:04] matured and become
[1:54:07] one
[1:54:09] Hallelujah now so you got your Pottery
[1:54:11] right right you got the you got the
[1:54:13] potter's wheel the guys doing that and
[1:54:15] then they then they glaze it and they
[1:54:17] put the little pretty stuff on it and
[1:54:19] they they but and that it but it it
[1:54:22] until until you're until you're ready to
[1:54:23] go through the
[1:54:25] fire but when they take that Pottery all
[1:54:28] of that painting can be washed off all
[1:54:31] of that stuff can come
[1:54:33] off that's right we sing you know you're
[1:54:35] the Potter and I'm the clay
[1:54:39] amen here here when they go through that
[1:54:42] process now you don't want to try this
[1:54:43] at home because amen this this this this
[1:54:48] this process at home your your stove you
[1:54:50] know it might get up to $450
[1:54:53] deg they they that Kiln they'll heat
[1:54:56] that up to
[1:54:58] 1,500 plus
[1:55:02] degrees and they'll heat it now if they
[1:55:04] do it too long it'll just disintegrate
[1:55:06] it right but they stand and they're
[1:55:08] watching over the
[1:55:10] Clay they're watching over itlu they're
[1:55:13] heating it
[1:55:15] up and right before the Master's
[1:55:21] eyes the
[1:55:23] clay and the
[1:55:26] print is all becoming one
[1:55:30] Hallelujah right before the Master's
[1:55:33] eyes as he is watching he knows what
[1:55:35] he's he's he's done invested all that
[1:55:37] time and he ain't going to burn that
[1:55:39] clay up all amen amen but now it's time
[1:55:42] for the
[1:55:43] fire and sometimes you're going through
[1:55:45] the fire on and you don't understand
[1:55:48] what's going on Hallelujah but I just
[1:55:51] want to tell you there's that
[1:55:53] transformation that is taking place the
[1:55:56] clay is becoming
[1:56:00] Pottery I I I I I just love it only the
[1:56:05] Kim can reach the temperatures of over
[1:56:09] 1,500 degre Fahrenheit amen which is
[1:56:13] needed you can't do this anywhere else

[1:57:04] Kil there's many tears
[1:57:08] pain
[1:57:13] Agony many sleepless
[1:57:19] nights but it's in those times when you
[1:57:21] look and you think
[1:57:23] I'm understanding a little bit more why
[1:57:25] Jesus said
[1:57:26] blessed are you when you're persecuted
[1:57:29] for my name's sake blessed when you're
[1:57:31] reviled against

[1:58:34] you but I promise
[1:58:37] you you'll come out with
[1:58:41] character good
[1:58:45] pre the Apostle
[1:58:48] Paul or what we read the other night
[1:58:51] even brother brother random and say is
[1:58:52] it strange that God wants to develop a
[1:58:54] Christlike character that comes through
[1:58:56] suffering no sir we all have trials we
[1:58:58] all we are all tried chasen his sons not

[1:59:09] isn't of God all right the Apostle Paul
[1:59:13] had to be molded there in 1 Corinthians
[1:59:16] 2 and one it says I Brethren when I came
[1:59:18] to you came not with the Excellency of
[1:59:20] speech and of wisdom declaring unto you
[1:59:23] the testimony of the Lord for I
[1:59:24] determined not to know anything among
[1:59:26] you save Jesus Christ and him
[1:59:28] crucified I was with you in weakness and
[1:59:30] in fear and much
[1:59:32] trembling my speech and my preaching was
[1:59:35] not with enticing words of man's
[1:59:38] Wisdom but I did have the demonstration
[1:59:41] of the power of the spirit of
[1:59:43] God that your faith should not stand in
[1:59:46] the wisdom of man but in the
[1:59:48] power of God Amen can you say

[2:08:55] go
[2:08:56] well long story
[2:08:59] short we got the truck back home and
[2:09:02] then we went
[2:09:04] to so then we had the other two trucks
[2:09:06] going and in Oklahoma City and and I was
[2:09:09] on one end of town and the other driver
[2:09:12] was on the other end of town and so we
[2:09:13] had agreed that we were going to work
[2:09:15] till it till it was it was cloudy going
[2:09:18] to be raining I said let's work until
[2:09:19] the time and then throw tarps over the
[2:09:21] over the stuff and then we'll we'll
[2:09:23] we'll pick up afterwards it shouldn't
[2:09:25] take long and anyways I I I got my stuff
[2:09:28] picked up before the rain hit and so I'm
[2:09:29] going over to his spot and it's pouring
[2:09:32] it's pouring and he's just standing out
[2:09:34] in the
[2:09:36] rain and so is my
[2:09:40] shoes he didn't have his Dolly he' lost
[2:09:43] it somewhere and lost the tarp somewhere
[2:09:45] and all of my
[2:09:48] shoes were
[2:09:50] ruined
[2:09:55] I'm looking there and
[2:10:01] uh I want to get mad I want to get mad
[2:10:04] at both the drivers but I can't get mad
[2:10:05] at both the drivers I'm I'm the one that
[2:10:08] God's molding the character
[2:10:10] in I'm the one that's getting
[2:10:17] whooping it was hard digging out of that
[2:10:24] cuz the guy that loaned me the money
[2:10:26] well he's going to want his
[2:10:32] money I didn't have it so I said all
[2:10:36] right we can do this I'm a big boy we
[2:10:39] can do
[2:10:40] this I got out
[2:10:42] selling and it seemed like the sales
[2:10:44] just every town we'd go into there' be
[2:10:47] all of these little guys with little
[2:10:48] boxes you know I'd come in with my big
[2:10:50] old rig and they they'd have their
[2:10:52] little 10 boxes out there and they' just
[2:10:54] set up all around me wherever I was
[2:10:56] going they'd have their little boxes and
[2:10:57] then
[2:10:58] discount if I'm doing mine for 20
[2:11:00] they're doing theirs for
[2:11:04] 10 so I said all right two can play this
[2:11:07] game so since I was the big wig of the
[2:11:11] of the deal there I started slashing
[2:11:13] prices
[2:11:15] and that was a bad
[2:11:20] idea but bottom line
[2:11:24] was it took me two
[2:11:27] years before I got that money paid
[2:11:33] back and it wasn't by selling
[2:11:46] shoes Austin the Lord was whooping me
[2:11:54] it was a humbling
[2:11:56] experience couldn't hold my head up
[2:11:59] high I knew I was
[2:12:06] wrong but you know what that experience
[2:12:08] done for
[2:12:10] me that
[2:12:13] experience let me know that God loved me
[2:12:17] that's right he told my father to warn
[2:12:20] me
[2:12:22] I had the I had I had the opportunity to
[2:12:25] accept or reject and I
[2:12:32] rejected but the Lord was not going to
[2:12:36] allow this
[2:12:39] pastor to be out there when and Sher the
[2:12:43] responsibilities that I
[2:12:45] had I had responsibility before
[2:12:50] God
[2:12:53] amen so the testings and the trials the
[2:12:57] situations that I endured and having to
[2:13:01] dig myself out of that thank God for his
[2:13:04] grace and helping me to dig myself out
[2:13:06] of
[2:13:08] it but it taught
[2:13:11] me now if it doesn't teach me then what
[2:13:15] good is the trial that's
[2:13:17] right but I had it this this was a trial
[2:13:23] in front of the whole church it was a
[2:13:24] trial in front of the community it was a
[2:13:27] trial in front of
[2:13:31] everyone I had to learn my lesson and I
[2:13:35] if y'all had time I I could share a
[2:13:36] bunch of them
[2:13:38] amen bunch of my
[2:13:43] stories I'm
[2:13:46] thankful that God has not just called
[2:13:50] me
[2:13:51] and left
[2:13:54] me but God has promised to mold
[2:13:58] me and make
[2:14:01] me I'm thankful to stand here today that
[2:14:05] he who has begun the good
[2:14:10] work has been faithful and will be
[2:14:14] faithful to complete that work in
[2:14:19] me if the musicians would
[2:14:28] come

[2:14:44] sermon
[2:14:45] situations sometimes can be your best
[2:14:50] teacher
[2:14:51] sermons can be
[2:14:54] preached but trials is where you
[2:14:58] [Music]
[2:15:00] live and God doesn't want us just say an
[2:15:02] amen to the preacher but God wants that
