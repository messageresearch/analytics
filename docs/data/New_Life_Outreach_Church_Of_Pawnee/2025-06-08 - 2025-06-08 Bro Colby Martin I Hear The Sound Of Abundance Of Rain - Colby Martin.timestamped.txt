[29:38] I'm not the same that I used to
[29:41] be. And uh so I'm I'm used to always
[29:45] make fun of those guys that had to have
[29:47] these flats all the time. And uh these
[29:51] days I'm using flats, man. And
[29:55] um so maybe this will
[29:59] be I'm singing about a different
[30:03] breed. We sprang up from the original
[30:09] sea. Chosen and elected from the
[30:15] beginning of time.
[30:20] We'll never be a
[30:23] chicken. We won't take Oh, Satan's
[30:28] licking. You see, were born when hers
[30:33] were the eagle
[30:35] [Music]
[30:37] kind. We're an army of
[30:42] believers. That makes us
[30:45] naturalborn deceivers.
[30:48] hopeless
[30:50] thoughts, doubts, and fears we've left
[30:56] behind. While others think of
[31:01] dying, all I've got on my mind is
[31:05] flying. I repeat, that's the nature of
[31:11] the eagle
[31:15] kind. No barnyard bruise can hold us. No
[31:21] chicken coupe can mold
[31:24] us. We'll just keep on
[31:28] going. We'll never lag
[31:33] behind. We're going to keep on
[31:37] growing. This bunch will do more than
[31:41] crowing.
[31:43] I repeat, we're not the chicken
[31:47] worthy eagle
[31:50] kind. We're an army of
[31:55] believers. That makes us
[31:58] naturalborn
[32:00] receivers. Hopeless
[32:02] thoughts, doubts, and fears we've left
[32:09] behind. While others think of
[32:13] dying, all I've got on my mind is
[32:17] flying. I repeat, we're not the chicken
[32:22] worth the eagle
[32:26] kind. No barnyard bruise can hold us. No
[32:32] chicken coup can mold us. But we'll just
[32:37] keep on going. We'll never lag
[32:43] [Music]
[32:44] behind. We're going to keep on
[32:48] growing. This bunch will do more than
[32:52] crowing. I repeat, we're not the chicken
[32:57] worthy eagle kind.
[33:01] We're an army of
[33:05] believers that makes us
[33:08] naturalborn
[33:10] receivers. Hopeless thoughts and doubts
[33:14] and fears we left
[33:18] behind. While others fame
[33:22] dying, all I've got on my mind is
[33:26] flying. I repeat, that's the nature of
[33:32] the eagle kind. Let me try another
[33:37] verse. We're taking on
[33:42] inspiration. We're living the
[33:45] revelation. Our eyesight get
[33:50] cleaner cuz we're not blind.
[33:55] We'll never feast on dead things by the
[34:00] spirit. We're being fed things. I
[34:04] repeat, we are not the chicken worthy
[34:08] eagle kind.
[34:11] Well, I'm an army of
[34:15] believers that makes us naturalb born
[34:18] receiving hurts. The hopeless thoughts,
[34:23] our doubts and fears with love and
[34:28] pain. While others think
[34:32] dying, all I've got on my mind is lying.
[34:37] I repeat, that's the nature of the evil
[34:44] kind. While others think of
[34:48] dying, all I've got on my mind is
[34:52] flight, I repeat, that's the nature of
[34:58] the evil
[35:00] [Music]
[35:04] kind. Amen.

[38:45] child of God.
[38:48] [Music]
[38:50] I'm no

[38:53] slave to
[38:57] fear. I
[38:59] am a
[39:02] child of
[39:04] God. And from my mother's

[39:41] slain to
[39:43] [Applause]
[39:45] fear. I
[39:47] am a
[39:49] child of God. Sing it again.

[40:25] love. You rescued me. So I still
[40:31] say I am a
[40:35] child. Sing that again. You split the
[40:38] [Music]
[40:40] seas. You split the seas so I can walk
[40:45] right
[40:48] through. My fears are drowned in perfect
[40:52] love.
[40:53] [Music]
[40:56] You rescued me so I can stand and
[41:02] see. I am a
[41:05] child of God. I'm no longer Oh, I'm no
[41:11] longer a slave to
[41:15] fear. Thank you, Lord, for I am a
[41:21] child of God. Oh, I'm no
[41:26] longer a
[41:28] slave to
[41:30] [Music]
[41:32] fear. For I am a
[41:36] child of God. For I am for I am a child
[41:44] of God. without music. The last lines
[41:48] for I am a
[41:51] child of
[41:54] God. How many can say I am a child of
[41:57] God
[41:58] tonight? Oh my.
[42:00] Amen. We don't have to be a slave to
[42:03] fear for children of God. Amen. Can we
[42:07] go to be B minor? Try this song. I like
[42:10] the song. I see a cloud like a man's
[42:14] hand.
[42:16] Amen. Try this here
[42:19] tonight. I see a cloud like a man's
[42:26] head. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[42:32] head. Oh, now I see a cloud like a man's
[42:38] hand.
[42:40] And I
[42:41] [Music]
[42:42] know it's going to
[42:46] rain. Oh, at a time when it was dry, not
[42:50] a cloud in the sky, the children of God
[42:55] began to reason
[42:59] why. Oh. So they went to God's men cuz
[43:04] they didn't understand. He said, "Go
[43:07] look. It's written in the
[43:12] sky. Oh, now I see a cloud like a man's
[43:19] head. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[43:25] head. Oh, now I see a cloud like a man's
[43:32] head. And I
[43:35] know it's going to rain.
[43:40] So they opened up the door like that.
[43:43] The seventh time they looked once more.
[43:47] A tiny cloud was rising from the
[43:52] sea. Then they began to understand that
[43:57] a heavy rain was at hand, just like
[44:01] God said it would be. Oh my. Well, now I
[44:08] see. Do you see it
[44:10] tonight? Yes, I do. Oh, I see a
[44:18] clown. Oh, and I see a cloud like a
[44:25] man. And I
[44:28] know it's going to
[44:31] rain. Here we go. So today we have no
[44:35] fear. We know a cloud did appear. The
[44:39] promise free my bride roll through that
[44:44] door. Oh just have faith and just
[44:48] believe. God's spirit you'll
[44:51] receive. The
[44:54] rain is going to
[44:57] pour.
[44:58] Oh I see.
[45:03] Yes, I do. Oh, I see a clown like a
[45:09] man's head. Oh, now I see a clown like a
[45:15] man's
[45:17] hand. And I
[45:20] know it's going to rain for one more
[45:22] verse. Okay. Now the bride is looking
[45:27] above for a chariot rain of love to heal
[45:32] their hearts with peace they've never
[45:37] known. And soon this bride shall be
[45:41] God's unfolding
[45:43] mystery. The promised
[45:46] word has already been sown.
[45:50] Oh, I see a clown like a man's
[45:56] head. Oh, I see a clown like a man's
[46:02] head. Oh, now I see a cloud like a man's
[46:09] head. And I
[46:12] know it's going to rain.
[46:16] [Music]
[46:20] Hallelujah. You believe that
[46:23] tonight? Amen. Amen. I see the cloud.
[46:26] Glory like a man's hand. Amen. God bless
[46:30] you here tonight. If you have your
[46:32] Bibles, like to turn to First Kings 18
[46:35] and verse
[46:37] one. Appreciate our musicians. Amen.
[46:40] Appreciate Brother Merl. Amen. I enjoyed
[46:43] his song leading today and am a little
[46:45] nervous. So, just uh bear with me here
[46:49] tonight. Did you enjoy the uh the p our
[46:52] pastor's sermon this morning? Amen. I
[46:55] thought it was very good and very
[46:57] timely. Amen. First Kings 18 and verse
[47:00] one. When you're there, say amen. Amen.
[47:04] It says, "And it came to pass after many
[47:07] days that the word of the Lord came to
[47:10] Elijah in the third year, saying, Go
[47:12] show thyself unto Ahab, and I will send
[47:15] rain upon the earth." And Elijah went to
[47:18] show himself unto Ahab, and there was a
[47:21] sore famine in Samaria. Now, if we can
[47:24] drop to verse uh
[47:28] 41. And Elijah said unto Ahab, "Get thee
[47:32] up, eat and drink, for there is a sound
[47:35] of abundance of rain." So Ahab went up
[47:38] to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up
[47:41] to the top of Carbal. And he cast
[47:43] himself down upon the earth and put his
[47:47] face between his knees and said to his
[47:50] servant, "Go up now and look toward the
[47:53] sea. And he went up and looked." And
[47:56] there was nothing. And he said, "Go
[47:58] again seven times." And it came to pass
[48:01] at the seventh time that he said,
[48:03] "Behold, there ariseth a little cloud
[48:05] out of the sea like a man's hand." And
[48:08] he said, "Go up, and say to Ahab,
[48:11] prepare thy chariot." All right? And get
[48:13] thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
[48:17] And it came to pass in the meanwhile
[48:18] that the heavens were black with clouds
[48:20] and wind, and there was a great terrain.
[48:23] And Ahab rode and went to Jezrael. And
[48:26] the hand of the Lord was on Elijah. And
[48:29] he girded up his loins and ran before
[48:33] Ahab to the entrance of Jezrael.
[48:37] Can we just bow our heads here tonight?
[48:39] Heavenly Father, how we love you. Want
[48:41] to appreciate your presence that we feel
[48:44] in our midst here tonight. I'm ask you,
[48:47] Lord, that you'll be with us in this
[48:49] remaining part of the service. Lord,
[48:52] bless your reading of the word. In your
[48:54] name we pray. Amen. God bless. You may
[48:57] be seated here tonight.
[49:01] And we're going to start off with the
[49:03] story just for a moment. The story
[49:06] basically was about a terrible drought.
[49:09] And it says, "Crops dried up and
[49:11] livestock stood in danger of dying of
[49:13] thirst. And in the midst of impeding
[49:16] disaster, a humble minister asked
[49:18] members of his congregation to fast and
[49:21] pray for rain. The entire community was
[49:24] asked to join in a massive appeal to the
[49:27] Lord that in his mercy he would send
[49:29] rain. People gathered joining prayers
[49:32] and hoping to pierce the heavens that
[49:35] seemed to seal life spared moisture from
[49:37] the earth. Among them was one young girl
[49:41] who in an act of sure faith brought an
[49:44] umbrella. It says here she was the only
[49:47] petitioner for moisture who was certain
[49:50] that it was going to rain right that
[49:53] day. Amen. And we talk about wanting the
[49:56] blessings of God. Yeah. But what I'm
[49:58] here to ask, but are are we willing to
[50:00] act like it's already happened? Okay.
[50:04] And if I had any thought here this
[50:05] evening, it would be I hear the sound of
[50:08] abundance of rain. And
[50:11] looking at the definition for abundance,
[50:14] it means an extremely plentiful or
[50:17] oversufficient quantity or supply. It's
[50:20] an overflowing fulfilledness, a a large
[50:23] quantity. It says here, the situation in
[50:26] which there is more than enough of
[50:29] something. I love that. the situation in
[50:33] which there is more than enough of
[50:36] something. So we see from our scripture
[50:38] reading Elijah had a vision after three
[50:41] and a half years of drought and Elijah's
[50:44] vision called for an abundance of rain.
[50:47] Now this vision was given directly by
[50:50] God. Do you believe that? Now the
[50:52] interesting thing is that immediately
[50:54] after God spoke to Elijah, the Bible
[50:57] states that there was a sore famine in
[51:00] the land. All right, what a paradox. God
[51:03] steps into famine and promises an
[51:06] abundance of rain. And we see that God
[51:09] has a way of stepping into the bleakest
[51:11] of situations and promising victory.
[51:15] Hello, somebody. In the times where it's
[51:17] the bleakest part of our life, God
[51:20] promised in those moments that there
[51:22] will be a victory that comes in those
[51:25] times. And in fact, it is those times
[51:28] that God chooses to work the most
[51:30] because when God brings flood out of a
[51:33] drought or feast out of a famine,
[51:36] everybody knows that it wasn't a man
[51:38] that did it, but it was God. It's not
[51:41] your ability, but it is God's ability to
[51:45] work in the impossible.
[51:47] When God comes into a situation and
[51:50] performs the miraculous, you have to
[51:52] realize it is not you, but God. Amen. It
[51:56] was Gideon that God said in Judges 7
[51:59] and2, "The people that are with thee are
[52:02] too many for me to give the Midianites
[52:05] into their hand, unless Israel von
[52:08] themselves against me, saying, "My own
[52:10] hand has saved me." It was Gyrus's
[52:14] daughter that Jesus allowed to die so he
[52:17] could raise her back from the dead. God
[52:19] delights in working when man cannot
[52:23] work. God delights in bringing answers
[52:26] to situations that have stomped many
[52:28] men. Amen. God delights in doing what
[52:32] men says can't be done. That men say
[52:35] that it is impossible. God says my glory
[52:38] I won't share with another. That God
[52:42] specializes in doing the impossible. God
[52:46] will allow the doctors to perform
[52:47] surgery on the body. But it is God that
[52:50] heals the body. It is God that protects
[52:53] during the operation. It is God that
[52:55] guides the hands of the doctor.
[52:58] Hallelujah. God can use man. Do you
[53:00] believe that? Amen. Hallelujah. God
[53:03] specializes in doing the miraculous. And
[53:07] when we get to our wits end and feel
[53:09] like it's hopeless, that is where God
[53:12] begins to work. Yes. God begins to work
[53:16] when man just runs out of ideas. Okay.
[53:19] When man use all of their abilities to
[53:22] make a an impossible situation work,
[53:24] that is where God can step in and say,
[53:26] "Now it is my time to show you that I
[53:30] can move."
[53:32] Amen. Amen. I love it when my wife comes
[53:36] to ask me to to do something that she
[53:38] can't. And I got to be honest, there's a
[53:40] lot of
[53:41] things that my wife can do.
[53:44] She's very talented. She's a lot more
[53:46] talented than I am. But there's a
[53:48] there's a few things that she needs my
[53:50] help on, like opening a jar. Now, I
[53:54] right that may seem small to the guy,
[53:58] but it's it's it's showing you know
[53:59] what? I still got some muscle here and I
[54:02] can Yeah. Yeah. Patrick's over there
[54:04] touching his muscles.
[54:06] Absolutely. That I can pop this jar open
[54:09] and it makes me proud. Yeah. you know,
[54:11] yeah, my wife can can can can drywall
[54:14] and my wife can do all this stuff that I
[54:15] can't do, but she can't open a jar.
[54:19] So, that's where I come in and what I'm
[54:20] trying to get at that God loves when his
[54:23] bride comes to him when they've done all
[54:25] they can and ask for help. God loves to
[54:29] flex his muscles just a little bit and
[54:31] to show off for his bride. Hallelujah.
[54:34] God says, "Prove me, test me, and see if
[54:38] I can't do this for you." Yeah. Hello
[54:40] somebody. Matthew 19 and 26 says, "But
[54:44] Jesus beheld them and said unto them,
[54:47] with man, this is impossible, but with
[54:50] God, all things, all things, all things,
[54:54] Amen. All things, all things, that
[54:57] healing that you need in your body, that
[54:59] deliverance that you need in your life,
[55:01] all things are possible with God." Amen.
[55:08] It's amazing. Many times when God speaks
[55:11] of increase, it's in the time that we're
[55:15] a at loss and barrenness. This is where
[55:18] faith has to come in. This is where the
[55:21] promise of God will be tested the most
[55:24] in our lives. Brother Brandham says
[55:26] here, it's a very familiar quote, but
[55:28] God loves to test his people. Okay? He
[55:32] will allow certain circumstances in your
[55:35] life to see your response or your
[55:38] reaction to that circumstance.
[55:41] Just because you have trials in your
[55:43] life and and it feels like everything is
[55:45] falling apart does not mean that God is
[55:47] not with you. Just because you have not
[55:51] received your full healing doesn't mean
[55:54] that God has forsaken you. Hallelujah.
[55:57] That's right. God spoke to Abraham and
[56:00] gave him a promise and then
[56:03] immediately there was a famine. Yeah.
[56:06] Yeah. Joseph was was given a dream by
[56:08] God. Then immediately was thrown into a
[56:11] pit and sold into slavery. Okay. David
[56:13] was anointed king of Israel. Then he was
[56:16] sent back to the pastures to tend his
[56:19] sheep. The widow woman was promised
[56:21] increase by Elijah when she was
[56:23] preparing to die. Hello somebody.
[56:27] God promised that he would bring a
[56:29] living breathing army back to life while
[56:33] Ezekiel was staring at their dry bones
[56:35] scattered across the valley floor. Jesus
[56:39] was baptized and then right after was
[56:42] led into the wilderness to be tempted of
[56:44] the devil. God's promise is always
[56:47] followed by God's proving ground. Okay.
[56:50] All right. Hello, somebody. It's easy to
[56:53] trust in God in the time of surplus, but
[56:57] what about in your time of barrenness?
[57:00] Brother Mike, it's easy to praise him
[57:02] when the work's coming in, but what
[57:04] about in the time when you have no work
[57:06] and your bank account is looking a
[57:08] little low? It's easy to trust God when
[57:11] your child is healthy and your child is
[57:14] well, but what about the time when your
[57:16] child is sick and it ain't getting any
[57:19] better? Okay. All right. Hello,
[57:22] somebody. It's easy to trust God when
[57:25] his presence is moving in this place and
[57:27] you're with a bunch of believers, but
[57:29] what about the times when you feel dry
[57:31] and you're by yourself?
[57:34] Hello, somebody. It's easy to whip the
[57:36] devil when you have a bunch of believers
[57:38] here. Yeah. But what about the time when
[57:41] you're alone and you're fighting a
[57:43] mental warfare? What about those time?
[57:45] Are you going to place your trust in
[57:47] God? Yeah. Yeah. The greatest test of
[57:50] our faith comes when God says, "I will
[57:53] and we look around and he hasn't yet."
[57:55] Oh my. But just because he hasn't yet,
[57:59] does not mean he's not going to. Just
[58:02] believe. Just because grandpa has been
[58:05] fighting Parkinson's for many of years
[58:07] now does not believe that God has
[58:09] forsaken him. I believe his victory is
[58:12] still on the way. Amen. Hello, somebody.
[58:15] Yes. But in every case, no matter how
[58:18] long it took, God's promises has always
[58:22] come to pass. God has not failed one
[58:26] time.
[58:28] I'm a living witness in the crazy life
[58:31] that I've had that God has not failed me
[58:34] yet.
[58:36] I may have failed God time and time and
[58:39] time again, but God has never failed me
[58:42] yet. Praise the Lord. Praise God. Look
[58:45] to your neighbor and say, "God has never
[58:47] failed." "God has never failed." Look to
[58:50] your other neighbor, Sister Tracy, and
[58:52] you don't have one, and say, "God has
[58:55] never failed."
[58:57] Second Peter 3:9 says, "The Lord is not
[59:00] slack concerning his promise as some men
[59:03] count slackness, but is long-suffering
[59:06] to us, not willing that any should
[59:09] perish." Psalms 126 and 5 says, "They
[59:13] that sow in tears, oh my, shall we joy,
[59:18] he that goeth forth and weeping, bearing
[59:21] precious seeds, shall doubtless come
[59:23] again with rejoicing, bringing his sheav
[59:27] with him." Okay? Sometimes when we can't
[59:30] see it, we think it will never happen.
[59:33] Okay? We think that that God has
[59:35] forgotten his word and his promise, but
[59:38] that's where faith has to come in. I
[59:42] know this is simple. Good preaching, but
[59:44] I'm here to to help build up your faith
[59:46] here at New Life Outreach. God's promise
[59:50] has always required a step of faith.
[59:53] Faith is not sight. Faith is acting upon
[59:57] something that you cannot see. In in
[1:00:00] fact the very definition of faith is
[1:00:02] found in Hebrews 11:1. Now faith is the
[1:00:06] substance yeah of things hoped for and
[1:00:09] the evidence of things not seen. The NCV
[1:00:14] version says this that faith means being
[1:00:17] sure of the things we hope for and
[1:00:19] knowing that something is real even if
[1:00:23] we do not see it. All right. Oh my.
[1:00:28] Faith is simply disregarding my current
[1:00:31] circumstance and believing God for what
[1:00:34] he promised me no matter how wild it may
[1:00:38] seem. Amen. All right. That is faith.
[1:00:41] Yeah. It seemed crazy to the onlookers
[1:00:44] when Abraham of 75 says, "We are going
[1:00:48] to have a child." The scoffers are
[1:00:51] saying, "Abraham, oh my, you and Sarah
[1:00:55] are too old. She's barren.
[1:00:57] She's never going to be able to produce
[1:01:00] a child of such an old age. And the
[1:01:02] scoffers today are saying it. It's crazy
[1:01:05] the way that you're living today. Oh my.
[1:01:07] It's crazy that you can believe God for
[1:01:10] something that hasn't happened yet.
[1:01:13] But don't you worry. One day your faith
[1:01:16] is going to be a reality. And that
[1:01:18] breakthrough and that healing and that
[1:01:20] deliverance that you have been looking
[1:01:22] for year after year after year is
[1:01:26] finally going to become a reality
[1:01:29] because God has never failed.
[1:01:33] Amen. God has never given a promise.
[1:01:35] I've given unfortunately I've given
[1:01:38] promises that I have not been able to
[1:01:40] keep. But when God makes a promise
[1:01:43] Hallelujah. When God makes a promise,
[1:01:45] he's going to move heaven and earth to
[1:01:47] make sure that that promise is fulfilled
[1:01:50] in your life. Amen. Come on, somebody.
[1:01:53] If he promised a body change, he's going
[1:01:56] to move heaven and earth to make sure
[1:01:58] that body change takes place. If he
[1:02:00] promised a rapture, he's going to move
[1:02:03] heaven and earth to make sure that every
[1:02:06] word that he's promised does not fall
[1:02:09] void. Amen. But it takes faith to
[1:02:12] believe in that. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:16] I believe it. Yes. Yes. Yes. But we have
[1:02:20] to believe by that six sense called
[1:02:24] faith.
[1:02:26] All right. Faith is Romans
[1:02:31] 4:19. It's talking about Abraham.
[1:02:35] And being not weak in faith, yes, he
[1:02:38] considered not his own body. now dead
[1:02:41] when he was about a hundred years old.
[1:02:43] Neither get the
[1:02:45] deadness of Sarah's womb. Faith is
[1:02:49] simply not giving up on the promise of
[1:02:51] God, even if it takes three and a half
[1:02:53] years of drought for that rain to come
[1:02:56] or in Joseph's case 13 years or
[1:02:58] Abraham's case 25 years. Faith is simply
[1:03:03] realizing that I may not see it. I may
[1:03:06] not feel it. I may not be able to touch
[1:03:08] it yet. But God said it. I believe it.
[1:03:12] God said it. I believe it. And not only
[1:03:16] do I believe, but I will act upon it
[1:03:18] even when others think I am crazy
[1:03:20] because God said it. I believe it. I may
[1:03:24] be like Peter when Jesus told him to
[1:03:26] throw his nets out again. I may have my
[1:03:28] doubts, but nevertheless, at thy word,
[1:03:31] Lord, I will. Hallelujah. Because he
[1:03:34] said it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[1:03:37] believe it. Hallelujah. I'm so glad that
[1:03:41] I'm not believing with my five senses.
[1:03:44] It's those five senses that get you in
[1:03:46] trouble. But there's another sense. All
[1:03:49] right. Brother Brandham called it that
[1:03:50] six sense. It's called faith. That's the
[1:03:54] realm where we do our fighting. It's in
[1:03:57] that realm of faith.
[1:04:00] Hello, somebody.
[1:04:03] Hope this is okay here this morning.
[1:04:05] Amen.
[1:04:07] Let's get back to Elijah for just a
[1:04:09] minute. Elijah's vision called for an
[1:04:13] abundance of rain. Not a sprinkle. Yeah.
[1:04:16] Yeah. Not a heavy doo. Yeah. Not a quick
[1:04:19] shower. Come on. But an abundance. Yeah.
[1:04:22] But immediately after the vision was
[1:04:24] given, the servant saw nothing. Now
[1:04:27] listen, there had been a drought for
[1:04:30] three and a half years. Yeah.
[1:04:34] And the first obstacle, I hope this is
[1:04:36] okay. My Amen. I hope you can see it.
[1:04:40] That the man of God had to overcome.
[1:04:45] Yeah. Was the obstacle of history. You
[1:04:50] say, "Brother Kobe, what are you
[1:04:51] saying?" There's many people that says,
[1:04:53] "It hasn't rained in years."
[1:04:56] What makes you think it will rain now?
[1:04:59] Or the devil will tell you that's the
[1:05:00] way it's always been. What makes you
[1:05:02] think things are going to change now? We
[1:05:05] We are accustomed to the famine. Don't
[1:05:07] try to make us think we can feast now.
[1:05:10] The way it's always been is the way it's
[1:05:12] always going to be. How many's heard
[1:05:14] that? Yeah.
[1:05:18] Yeah. We've had plenty of people through
[1:05:20] the years tell us they thought it was
[1:05:22] going to rain. Nothing has happened.
[1:05:24] Well, don't get our hopes up yet. When
[1:05:28] God desires to move in a group of
[1:05:30] people, he has to change their mindset.
[1:05:33] Hello, we get in our mind this is all
[1:05:35] there ever will be for me that I'm
[1:05:37] always going to be stuck in this
[1:05:38] condition that I'm never going to see my
[1:05:40] healing. God has to come down and break
[1:05:42] that mindset.
[1:05:44] We are all believers. I believe we're
[1:05:46] believers here tonight. But sometimes we
[1:05:48] get weary in our mind
[1:05:50] and we'll let a little doubt slip in.
[1:05:53] There'll be times of weaknesses where
[1:05:55] we're saying, "Maybe this is all there
[1:05:57] is for me." Yeah. Maybe this is how I'm
[1:06:00] always going to be. It takes God to come
[1:06:03] down and break that mindset to let you
[1:06:07] know that this is not what you were born
[1:06:09] to be. You do not have to be stuck in
[1:06:12] this condition. All right? But it takes
[1:06:14] faith to believe in God and say, "I
[1:06:18] don't see it, but I will accept it and
[1:06:21] believe it." Amen. I've been proud of
[1:06:23] grandpa. He's been struggling with this
[1:06:25] now for year after year after year, but
[1:06:29] he's still holding on to a promise that
[1:06:31] I will be healed. Yeah. All right.
[1:06:36] There's been many sicknesses going
[1:06:38] through this church. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:06:41] When were you healed of your high blood
[1:06:42] pressure? How many years has been now?
[1:06:48] 13 years. Yeah. And it seems like the
[1:06:50] devil has been trying to put it back on
[1:06:53] my mother again. But I'm here to tell
[1:06:55] you, if God healed you of it, you're
[1:06:57] healed of it.
[1:06:59] We don't have to accept the symptoms in
[1:07:02] our life. I've been believing with you,
[1:07:04] mother. Sure. I've been I I've battled
[1:07:07] with it a little bit. My wife could tell
[1:07:08] you of that. Yeah. It's no fun. But if
[1:07:12] God can heal my mother, God can heal me
[1:07:15] of high blood pressure. Amen. If she has
[1:07:18] done it for God has done it for a
[1:07:20] mother, come on. He can do it for you,
[1:07:22] sister Carol of whatever you're dealing
[1:07:24] with. If God has healed the body once,
[1:07:27] he can do it again. Because if God ever
[1:07:30] does something, he has to do it again.
[1:07:34] Because he says, "I am
[1:07:35] God and I change not." All
[1:07:39] right. And we get so used to living in
[1:07:42] that same old condition that we grow
[1:07:45] comfortable living with that hurdle,
[1:07:48] that mountain, that circumstance,
[1:07:50] whatever it may be that you're fighting
[1:07:52] here tonight. But just because God
[1:07:56] hasn't moved yet, doesn't mean he can't
[1:07:59] or he won't. It doesn't mean he's
[1:08:01] powerless. Hello, somebody. God is
[1:08:04] testing your faith to see if you will
[1:08:06] truly believe what he has said. And I've
[1:08:10] come to tell New Life Outreach here
[1:08:12] tonight that I hear the sound of
[1:08:15] abundance of rain. We have had a little
[1:08:18] bit of a dry spell in this church. It
[1:08:20] doesn't mean that God is finished with
[1:08:23] this church yet. That means we've got to
[1:08:25] start digging our valley full of ditches
[1:08:27] and start expecting God to move once
[1:08:30] again. We get so used to coming to the
[1:08:33] church and and having a ritual and doing
[1:08:36] the same thing over and over. Why not do
[1:08:38] something different and expect God to
[1:08:41] perform the miraculous again?
[1:08:44] We get so used to our circumstance, it's
[1:08:47] time we grab our shovels and we begin to
[1:08:50] dig ditches and say, "God, I'm expecting
[1:08:53] an abundance of rain here tonight. I
[1:08:56] don't know about you, but I know I am.
[1:08:58] Yeah, I'm sick and tired of living dry.
[1:09:01] I'm sick and tired of living with the
[1:09:03] same hurdles. I am sick and tired. It is
[1:09:07] time that we begin to reach out through
[1:09:10] faith. Amen. And say, I believe it.
[1:09:15] Amen. All right.
[1:09:19] Hallelujah.
[1:09:22] Glory to God.
[1:09:23] Somehow we have to be able to believe
[1:09:26] that God can do more for us than he's
[1:09:30] ever done before.
[1:09:32] All right. God can't do anything in the
[1:09:35] midst of people who won't believe.
[1:09:38] How many believers do we have in the
[1:09:40] building? All right. Amen. And because
[1:09:43] we're believers, we want we believe.
[1:09:48] We believe. That's what believers do.
[1:09:52] Amen. Remember the story of the blind
[1:09:54] man that went up for prayer. Brother
[1:09:55] Brenham asked, "Do you
[1:09:59] believe?" The man said, "Yes." I'm just
[1:10:02] paraphrasing here, so forgive me.
[1:10:04] Brother Brenham said, "Go then go on
[1:10:06] your way. You are healed." The man left
[1:10:08] the prayer line not seeing. Okay? So the
[1:10:11] next thing you see is the man is back in
[1:10:13] the prayer line approaching brother
[1:10:14] Brandham again and he says, "I thought
[1:10:17] you said I was healed." Yeah. And
[1:10:19] brother Brandham said, "I thought you
[1:10:20] said you believed."
[1:10:24] So what did brother Brandham tell him to
[1:10:26] do? Anyone can anyone tell me?
[1:10:30] Go out confessing. Go out believing. So
[1:10:33] the next thing you see is this blind man
[1:10:35] on the street corner. Extra extra. Read
[1:10:39] all about it. Thank God I'm healed.
[1:10:42] Yeah. Extra extra. Read all about it.
[1:10:47] Thank God I'm healed. Yeah. What was he
[1:10:49] doing? He was putting his faith into
[1:10:52] action and believing for something that
[1:10:54] had not happened yet. Come on. You say,
[1:10:56] "Brother Kobe, I'm I'm still feeling an
[1:10:58] ache in my back. Do you believe that God
[1:11:01] can heal you?" Yes, sir. Then go on
[1:11:03] confessing that God has already healed
[1:11:05] you. I believe with Brother Donald and
[1:11:08] Sister Angie on the sicknesses that
[1:11:10] they've been fighting. I believe God can
[1:11:12] touch that heart. Yes, I believe God can
[1:11:15] do a miracle before the doctor even
[1:11:18] performs surgery.
[1:11:20] But if God has to use the doctor, I
[1:11:23] believe in that he will give a total
[1:11:26] healing to brother Donald.
[1:11:28] I hear the sound.
[1:11:31] It's time that we start believing for
[1:11:34] God for miracles once again. Hallelujah.
[1:11:37] It's time that Kobe Martin begins to put
[1:11:40] his faith into action. Amen. Once
[1:11:44] again, this man came to the conclusion
[1:11:46] that no matter how silly he looked that
[1:11:50] he was going to believe and confess that
[1:11:53] God had already healed him. We know the
[1:11:55] story that God healed him sitting in a
[1:11:58] barber's chair. Yeah. Hallelujah. And
[1:12:01] it's time that we throw that garment
[1:12:03] that's been
[1:12:04] identified and tying you to that
[1:12:07] condition you've had year after year.
[1:12:09] It's time to start identifying with a
[1:12:12] new identity and saying, "I'm no longer
[1:12:15] identified as a beggar or as a man
[1:12:18] that's fighting cancer or whatever it
[1:12:21] may be, but I'm going to identify myself
[1:12:24] under his word
[1:12:27] that by his stripes, I am healed. I'm
[1:12:30] free. I'm delivered. I know this is
[1:12:33] simple.
[1:12:35] I just pray you can catch it here
[1:12:36] tonight."
[1:12:38] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:43] Bless the Lord. Skip some of this here
[1:12:45] tonight.
[1:12:48] Praise.
[1:12:51] Genesis
[1:12:55] 23:19. You're going to have to help me
[1:12:56] pronounce these names because I don't I
[1:12:58] don't know if I can pronounce them.
[1:13:00] And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his
[1:13:03] wife, in the cave of the field of
[1:13:07] what?
[1:13:09] Yeah.
[1:13:12] Before Mamry, is that what that is?
[1:13:15] Mamry. The same as he uh I can't even
[1:13:18] say nothing right now. He in the land of
[1:13:21] Canaan 24 and verse
[1:13:24] one. And Abraham was old and and well
[1:13:28] stricken in age. And the Lord had
[1:13:30] blessed
[1:13:31] Abraham in all
[1:13:33] things. Let's turn to Genesis 25 and
[1:13:36] verse
[1:13:37] one. Then again Abraham took a wife and
[1:13:42] her name was
[1:13:45] what? Coutura.
[1:13:48] Okay. And she bare him. Ziman. That
[1:13:51] right.
[1:13:56] Joshen meeting. Midian. that whatever
[1:13:59] these words are
[1:14:03] and what and shua.
[1:14:08] So we see here that God wasn't done
[1:14:11] using Abraham. All right. After Sarah
[1:14:15] died, God gave him
[1:14:17] what? One, two, three, four, five, six
[1:14:20] more children.
[1:14:23] Abraham says here, "I'm old, but God has
[1:14:26] blessed me with a son." Yeah. And if he
[1:14:29] did it then, he'll do it again and again
[1:14:34] and again and again. We got to come with
[1:14:38] that attitude. If God has done it once
[1:14:40] before, he can do it again. Okay? If God
[1:14:44] can deliver once before, he can what? Do
[1:14:48] it again. Do it again. If he can set the
[1:14:51] captives free once before, he can what?
[1:14:54] Do it again. If he can provide a turkey,
[1:14:58] yeah, for my grandmother because she
[1:15:01] wanted the turkey, he can what? Do it
[1:15:03] again. Do it again. If he can fill my
[1:15:06] grandpa's truck full of gas when he was
[1:15:09] on E and he did it back then, he can
[1:15:12] what? Do it again. He can do it again.
[1:15:16] There is no circumstance that you can go
[1:15:19] through that God hasn't already
[1:15:21] performed a a miracle once before. Well,
[1:15:24] you say, "Well, this this may be new to
[1:15:26] God." There is nothing new to God under
[1:15:28] the sun. No matter what you're dealing
[1:15:30] with right here, it may be a mental
[1:15:32] warfare that you're fighting right now
[1:15:34] in your mind tonight. God can bring
[1:15:36] peace to the mind.
[1:15:39] God can bring peace.
[1:15:42] Hallelujah. God can heal you physically.
[1:15:44] He can also heal you mentally. All
[1:15:46] right. Hello, somebody. Amen. Amen. I
[1:15:50] hope this is okay. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:54] Amen. You say brother Kobe, I've been in
[1:15:56] a drought.
[1:16:00] It's been a long time.
[1:16:03] Like I got used to this condition that I
[1:16:05] am in.
[1:16:08] Yeah. Don't give me any
[1:16:16] hope. You know, with that attitude,
[1:16:18] that's the reason we can never have be
[1:16:21] delivered.
[1:16:23] is we're comfortable where we're at.
[1:16:28] But unfortunately, I'm come here to give
[1:16:30] you hope,
[1:16:32] to say that God can take you out of that
[1:16:35] and give you a fresh
[1:16:37] mind, can give you a body that's healed
[1:16:40] and restored. He can restore marriages.
[1:16:42] Amen. Amen. I believe that I'm almost
[1:16:45] done. Go ahead, brother. When a preacher
[1:16:48] comes and preaches a message and it
[1:16:50] builds your faith and says things don't
[1:16:53] have to be like they've always been.
[1:16:56] Yeah.
[1:16:57] Rain is on the way. So you get up the
[1:17:01] next day. You're full of faith. Then
[1:17:04] you're full of expectation. You rush to
[1:17:06] the window of the kitchen. Yeah. You
[1:17:09] look
[1:17:10] outside and it's just like it's been the
[1:17:13] previous three and a half years. A
[1:17:16] cloudless sky. Oh wow. Oh my bright
[1:17:20] sunshine. All right. There's no crops.
[1:17:23] Dust is swollen everywhere.
[1:17:26] Come on. Come on. And where grass is
[1:17:30] supposed to
[1:17:32] be? It's just a brown tundra.
[1:17:36] Yeah. Yeah. How many likes grass? I like
[1:17:38] grass. I could not live in Arizona. I
[1:17:41] like grass. But there was no grass
[1:17:44] because it was so dry. And then your
[1:17:47] faith begins to plummet because you were
[1:17:50] believing and expecting rain. You had
[1:17:53] your hope so high that maybe today will
[1:17:55] finally be the day that things change.
[1:17:58] Okay?
[1:18:00] It's just as the Bible says that after
[1:18:02] the promise, there was a sore famine in
[1:18:05] the land. After the promise that God
[1:18:07] makes you and I, there may be a famine
[1:18:10] in your lives. And there were times I
[1:18:12] remember that I said that this was never
[1:18:14] going to happen. That things were never
[1:18:16] going to change. It's just me getting my
[1:18:19] hopes up, but I but I kept going through
[1:18:21] that window wishing and waiting for
[1:18:24] rain. Yeah. And I never seen the rain.
[1:18:28] Yeah. But one day Oh my. Come on. One
[1:18:31] day I went back to that window. Yeah.
[1:18:34] And I begin to see some rain splatter.
[1:18:38] Yeah.
[1:18:39] your expectation become a reality in
[1:18:42] your life. Yeah. Hello, somebody. I
[1:18:45] couldn't explain it. I couldn't
[1:18:47] understand it. But the rain that was
[1:18:49] promised began to pour. It is not all
[1:18:53] that big. It's it's a pretty small about
[1:18:55] the size of a man's hand. But I see a
[1:18:58] cloud. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:19:00] my.
[1:19:03] Hallelujah. I'm stepping out on faith
[1:19:05] again. brother and others see smallness.
[1:19:08] I see abundance. I hope this is okay.
[1:19:12] And maybe it's just a glimmer of hope,
[1:19:14] but you take hold of that and you hold
[1:19:17] on to that promise because your miracle
[1:19:20] is on its way. Glory to God. Oh my.
[1:19:24] Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] We'll skip some of this here. Zechariah
[1:19:28] 4:10 says, "For who shall
[1:19:31] despise the day of small things?" Yeah.
[1:19:35] God promised Abraham's seed as the sands
[1:19:39] of the sea and the stars of the sky. But
[1:19:41] it started with one baby boy. Amen.
[1:19:44] Jesus fed 5,000 on a hillside one day.
[1:19:48] But it started with two fish and five
[1:19:50] loaves of bread. God created this vast
[1:19:54] universe. All of it in six days. But it
[1:19:57] started on the first day simply creating
[1:20:01] night and day from nothingness. Yeah.
[1:20:04] Things that look small through the eyes
[1:20:06] of the natural become huge when you look
[1:20:08] through the eyes of the spiritual.
[1:20:11] I hope that's
[1:20:15] okay. I wonder if anyone this evening in
[1:20:19] this
[1:20:20] place can say, "I hear the sound of
[1:20:24] abundance of rain."
[1:20:27] I know you've been six times already,
[1:20:29] but this is different. On that seventh
[1:20:32] time, I hear the sound of abundance of
[1:20:36] rain. Brother Brandham says here, "Why
[1:20:39] the skies? It hadn't rained for three
[1:20:42] years and six months." Brass. Brass
[1:20:45] speaks of divine judgment. The brazen
[1:20:47] altar judgment upon the nation that had
[1:20:51] forgotten
[1:20:52] God. Brassy skies. Yeah. Yeah. Wish we
[1:20:56] had time to get into it. But then
[1:20:59] unbelief would have picked that up and
[1:21:01] thrown it away. Well, if that's all you
[1:21:04] can send me. Yeah. But what did Elijah
[1:21:07] see when he seen the very first wheel
[1:21:10] turn? Oh my. He said, I hear the sound
[1:21:13] of abundance of rain. No cloud. No
[1:21:16] bigger than that. What would it do to
[1:21:18] water a nation? Yeah. Why? If the cloud
[1:21:21] is so it's so hot in them skies that it
[1:21:24] would have woof vaporized it. Vapor
[1:21:27] would have went away like that. But as
[1:21:30] soon as Elijah saw the first sign, the
[1:21:33] first little teeny move, he said, "I
[1:21:34] hear." Hallelujah. The sound of
[1:21:36] abundance of rain when it's just a cloud
[1:21:39] that big. Yeah. Brother, I believe that
[1:21:41] right now at this moment that the power
[1:21:44] of the Holy Ghost is in this room to
[1:21:46] heal every sick person there is. that
[1:21:48] you can feel the cloud the size of a
[1:21:51] man's hand screaming a holler I hear the
[1:21:55] sound of a perfect healing God has to
[1:21:58] you reject and say well I didn't get
[1:22:00] nothing then they'll die out the hot
[1:22:03] waves of hell and doubt will fade it out
[1:22:05] of your soul but when you get that
[1:22:08] little grain of seed stand on it is not
[1:22:11] like the rock it's the rock of ages
[1:22:14] stand there and you will feel the sound
[1:22:17] of abundance of rain. You are God's
[1:22:20] child. Satan has put the affliction upon
[1:22:23] you. And you know what? God or Christ
[1:22:26] has already healed every one of you.
[1:22:29] Amen.
[1:22:31] Isaiah 58:9 says, "And thou then shalt
[1:22:34] thou call, and the Lord shall answer.
[1:22:38] Thou shalt cry, and he shall say,
[1:22:42] here I am."
[1:22:45] Amen.
[1:22:50] Amen. As the musicians come
[1:22:57] now tonight, if we could raise our cups
[1:23:00] to the Lord, I
[1:23:02] and expect
[1:23:04] the miraculous to happen in this church.
[1:23:06] I know I I believe it was Brother Daryl
[1:23:11] that said, "Here's my truck, Lord, not
[1:23:14] my cup." Cuz I don't want just a cup
[1:23:15] full. Yeah. I want a truck full.
[1:23:20] I want God to move. Once again, how many
[1:23:23] can say, "Lord, it may it may it may be
[1:23:24] just me here tonight, but Lord, I I need
[1:23:27] something from you. I'm raising my cup,
[1:23:32] Lord. Lord, we need you
[1:23:35] tonight. Forgive my chopped up way of
[1:23:39] getting this out here,
[1:23:40] Lord. But Lord, I've had a burden upon
[1:23:43] my heart. Seeing
[1:23:44] all the different
[1:23:47] sicknesses many people has been fighting
[1:23:49] in their bodies.
[1:23:51] Lord, seeing how the devil has been
[1:23:53] attacking the mind of the
[1:23:56] people. And Lord, we can go through dry
[1:23:59] spells in our
[1:24:01] walk. We can get so dry and so tired
[1:24:04] from this this life that we live in.
[1:24:11] Lord, I pray that your rain falls
[1:24:14] aresh over this congregation here
[1:24:17] tonight. Lord,
[1:24:20] heal the broken. Hallelujah. All the
[1:24:24] ones, Lord, that are fighting in their
[1:24:25] body, I pray that you'll heal them
[1:24:28] tonight. Lord, you promised it. We
[1:24:31] believe it. And that settles it. No
[1:24:34] matter how long it
[1:24:35] takes, we
[1:24:37] know that your promise is on its way. If
[1:24:41] we can
[1:24:42] simply not look through the eyes of
[1:24:44] doubt, but through the eyes of faith and
[1:24:48] realize that we may not have our answer,
[1:24:51] but we know that your answer is
[1:24:55] coming. Touch each member here tonight,
[1:24:57] Lord. Maybe this message was just for me
[1:25:01] and what I've been going through in my
[1:25:03] own
[1:25:04] life. But Lord, I I
[1:25:07] pray that there is something spoken here
[1:25:09] tonight.
[1:25:12] Lord, help us to look past the eyes of
[1:25:15] doubt and the different things that the
[1:25:18] enemy will try to place upon us and get
[1:25:21] to that sixth sense.
[1:25:23] Lord, may we see that in that realm all
[1:25:26] things are possible.
[1:25:29] We may not feel it, but we believe it.
[1:25:31] Lord, we may not see it, but we believe
[1:25:34] it. Glory to God. We're believers.
[1:25:37] That's what believers do. Hallelujah.
[1:25:41] Thank you, Lord, for your love and your
[1:25:42] mercy.
[1:25:44] Your name we pray.
[1:25:48] Amen. And amen. Let can we go to

[1:49:37] not in
[1:49:39] part,
[1:49:40] but the
[1:49:47] whole is
[1:49:50] nailed to the
[1:49:54] cross and I
[1:49:57] bear it no more. H praise the
[1:50:05] Lord.
[1:50:06] Praise the
[1:50:08] Lord.
[1:50:10] Oh my
[1:50:16] soul. It is
[1:50:22] [Music]
[1:50:24] well with my soul.
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:32] It is
[1:50:35] well. It is well.
[1:50:43] Shall we try another
[1:50:44] verse? Oh, isn't there a wonderful
[1:50:46] presence?
[1:50:49] And Lord,
[1:50:52] haste the day. Yes,
[1:50:55] Lord. When my
[1:50:58] faith
[1:51:00] shall be
[1:51:03] sight, the
[1:51:06] clouds be wrote
[1:51:11] back as a
[1:51:13] scroll. This is true. This is true,
[1:51:16] folks.
[1:51:18] For the
[1:51:20] trump
[1:51:22] shall
[1:51:24] resound and the
[1:51:28] way
[1:51:29] shall descend.
[1:51:33] even
[1:51:36] soul. It is
[1:51:40] well with my
[1:51:42] [Applause]
[1:51:46] soul. It is
[1:51:50] well. It is
[1:51:54] well with my soul.
[1:52:02] It is
[1:52:05] well. It is
[1:52:09] well
[1:52:11] with my
[1:52:16] soul. Praise the
[1:52:19] Lord. Praise the
[1:52:22] Lord. We walk by faith.
[1:52:27] We're in this world, but we're not of
[1:52:29] this
[1:52:31] world. The trials of the world are very
[1:52:33] real, but so is the relationship with
[1:52:35] God. Very
[1:52:38] real. We walk not by sight, but by
[1:52:42] faith.
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:46] We're in a
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:51] control just as there is
[1:52:54] a radio
[1:52:59] station that can beam their their
[1:53:02] channel up to
[1:53:05] the
[1:53:08] satellite and that can be transmitted
[1:53:11] all over the
[1:53:12] world that Bill Gates enlightened
[1:53:16] station that we listen to here that you
[1:53:19] listen to on your car on that channel.
[1:53:22] Bill Bill Gaither bought the enlightened
[1:53:27] station. I've been I've been up far
[1:53:30] north where where you can't that you
[1:53:32] can't even get to them. You have to
[1:53:33] either get fly
[1:53:35] in, ride a boat
[1:53:37] in, or drive across the ice when all the
[1:53:40] legs freeze
[1:53:42] over. You go up into those tribe of
[1:53:45] those tribes of natives up
[1:53:47] there. You can you can go way way up
[1:53:50] there. I' I've been up there on the
[1:53:52] Hudson Bay where they they've had to fly
[1:53:55] us in. There's no other way to get there
[1:53:57] but to
[1:54:01] fly. And that
[1:54:04] channel that channel can still be
[1:54:07] listened
[1:54:08] to. It's
[1:54:12] because they are connected. All that is
[1:54:15] required is somebody being able to hook
[1:54:18] up to that
[1:54:19] satellite. We've got a living Lord Jesus
[1:54:23] Christ. We've got a living Lord Jesus
[1:54:28] Christ. And all we have to do is he just
[1:54:31] he just beams the satellite right down
[1:54:34] to every one of the believers. And we've
[1:54:36] got little receivers in our in our
[1:54:40] hearts. That receiver goes right back.
[1:54:45] We're able to talk with the Lord. You
[1:54:47] say, "Is he real? Jesus Christ is just
[1:54:49] as real as the as as as just as real
[1:54:53] sitting there in the thrones of heaven
[1:54:55] as as in that fourth
[1:54:58] dimension where there is a real place
[1:55:01] where there is a disc jockey sitting
[1:55:04] behind an an enlightened desk moving all
[1:55:08] of the the records and the or the CDs or
[1:55:12] whatever whatever they do things by
[1:55:14] these days.
[1:55:17] There is somebody controlling it
[1:55:19] physical somewhere controlling that that
[1:55:21] is sending sending the signals
[1:55:24] out. And if that can happen in that
[1:55:26] fourth dimension, then how much more in
[1:55:29] that seventh dimension where there is a
[1:55:32] living Jesus Christ, a living body that
[1:55:36] God lives
[1:55:40] in. And in our little church right here
[1:55:43] today, you can feel his presence and you
[1:55:46] can hear his words of encouragement
[1:55:49] right into your heart beaming to you
[1:55:51] right now.
[1:55:54] And it doesn't matter whether you're in
[1:55:56] the lion's den, it it it somehow makes
[1:55:58] it to the lion's den. I don't or whether
[1:56:00] you're in the whether you're in the
[1:56:02] well's belly, somehow or another, God
[1:56:04] just beams it right there. And it's the
[1:56:06] channels of faith that comes down to
[1:56:08] every one of our hearts.
[1:56:11] Only a believer can know
[1:56:13] that. Don't take that for granted. Never
[1:56:17] take it for granted because it's God's
[1:56:20] love to the
[1:56:22] believer. It's an eternal
[1:56:25] thing. Can you say amen? Do you love him
[1:56:28] with all of your heart? Amen. Yes. Now,
[1:56:33] when you're radio
[1:56:36] station, you can't beam your song back
[1:56:38] to Bill or
[1:56:40] whoever's Bill owns everything in the
[1:56:42] gospel world, but Amen. You You can't be
[1:56:46] beam your your I guess you can through
[1:56:49] text, but here
[1:56:51] tonight, you don't just have a receiver,
[1:56:54] but you have a sender.
[1:56:57] You've got angels that'll take your
[1:56:59] requests right back to God and tell him
[1:57:03] what you're thinking, what you're
[1:57:04] believing. Well, can you say amen? Do
[1:57:07] you love him tonight? God bless you.

[2:03:03] home. Now,
[2:03:06] saints, this
[2:03:08] message has been to give us a
[2:03:11] clear-cut view of
[2:03:14] Calvary, a very clear-cut view of your
[2:03:18] position. You cannot be in your position
[2:03:21] as long as you're in defeatism.
[2:03:23] Defeatism has got to be expelled from
[2:03:27] our minds and our
[2:03:29] hearts. Defeatism will never make a
[2:03:32] rapture. It'll
[2:03:34] never You can be humble and meek. Jesus
[2:03:37] was meek and
[2:03:39] humble. He was meek and humble. I could
[2:03:42] do nothing except the
[2:03:45] father, but he knew his position. I come
[2:03:48] from God and I go back to
[2:03:51] God. So defeatism isn't
[2:03:54] humility. Defeatism has nothing to do
[2:03:57] with
[2:03:58] humility. Amen. Humility is my strength
[2:04:01] comes from the Lord and he has exalted
[2:04:05] me. He has placed me in this day in a
[2:04:08] position of bride. Amen. And no man
[2:04:13] marries a woman to go around moping all
[2:04:15] the time and how bad and pitiful she is.
[2:04:18] She has to be proud of her man and he
[2:04:20] has to be proud of his woman and they
[2:04:23] are to work in harmony and love. Can you
[2:04:26] say amen? God don't want us under his
[2:04:29] feet. God wants us by his
[2:04:31] side. God don't want to drag us. God
[2:04:35] wants us by his side. God don't want to
[2:04:38] have to turn around and tell y'all. He
[2:04:40] will, but he don't want to have to turn
[2:04:41] around and tell you, "I told you I love
[2:04:42] you. Come on, I love you." Come on,
[2:04:46] let's let's let's believe what our what
[2:04:49] what our heavenly groom said. If he
[2:04:51] says, "I love you and I'll never forsake
[2:04:53] you," then believe him. Believe him,
[2:04:56] right? Believe him. Stand by his side.
[2:04:59] And if he says the works that I do, you
[2:05:01] can do too, believe him. If he says you
[2:05:05] can sign a check, then believe him.
[2:05:07] Amen. Stand with your man. Stand by
[2:05:11] Jesus Christ. Can you say amen? Amen.
[2:05:14] Amen. God bless you. We love you. We
[2:05:17] appreciate you very, very much. Amen.
[2:05:22] Praise the
[2:05:23] Lord. Greater is he that is within me.
[2:05:25] Let's sing this as we
[2:05:27] dismiss. Greater is he that is in
[2:05:31] me. Greater is he that is in me.
[2:05:37] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[2:05:42] is in the
[2:05:44] world. Greater is he that is in
[2:05:48] me. Greater is he that is in
[2:05:53] me. Greater is he that is in
[2:05:56] me than he that is in the world.
[2:06:02] Oh, Satan's like a roaring
[2:06:05] lion roaming to and
[2:06:09] fro, seeking whom he may devour. The
[2:06:15] Bible tells me
[2:06:18] so. Many souls have been his prey to
[2:06:23] fall in some weak
[2:06:25] cow. that God has promised us
[2:06:30] today is overcoming power. Oh yes,
[2:06:35] greater is he that is in
[2:06:38] me. Greater is he that is in
[2:06:42] me. Greater is he that is in me than he.
[2:06:48] Well, God bless you. You're dismissed in
[2:06:50] the fear of the Lord. press the battle.
[2:06:54] Pentecost, a rushing mighty
[2:06:59] wind flew in through the upper room and
[2:07:04] baptize all of
[2:07:07] them with the power greater
[2:07:11] than some earthly
[2:07:15] folk. And I'm so glad I've got it, too.
[2:07:20] I'm going to let the whole world know.
[2:07:23] Oh, greater is
[2:07:26] he. Yes. Greater is he that is in
[2:07:31] me. Greater is he that's in
[2:07:34] me than he that is in the world. God is
[2:07:40] greater than them. We got to get that
[2:07:45] verse. In me. Oh yes. Greater is he that
[2:07:49] is in me than he that is in the world.
[2:07:55] Oh, on the day of
[2:07:58] Pentecost, a Russian mighty
[2:08:03] wind blew into the upper room, baptized
[2:08:09] all of
[2:08:11] them with the power greater
[2:08:15] than any earthly
[2:08:18] foe. Oh, I'm so glad I've got it, too.
[2:08:24] going to let the whole world know.
