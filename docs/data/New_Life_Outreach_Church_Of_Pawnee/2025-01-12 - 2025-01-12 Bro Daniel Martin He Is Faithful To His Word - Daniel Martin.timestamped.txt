[48:10] usually we when we come it's usually
[48:12] during the meetings so everyone is busy
[48:14] and we don't have time to just sit down
[48:17] and visit so we uh decided to come and
[48:20] spend a week and um we've really enjoyed
[48:23] it amen un we really appreciate all that
[48:26] you done for us amen if we could turn to
[48:29] the Book of
[48:30] Joshua uh chapter 1 and um it's really
[48:33] good to have my wife and family with me
[48:35] as well amen but uh the Book of
[48:40] Joshua chapter 1 in verse one and we'll
[48:44] read the first three verses it says now
[48:46] after the death of Moses the servant of
[48:49] the Lord it came to pass that the Lord
[48:51] spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses
[48:54] Minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[48:58] now therefore arise go over this Jordan
[49:01] thou and all this people unto the land
[49:04] which I do give to them even to the
[49:06] children of Israel every place that the
[49:10] soul of your foot shall tread upon that
[49:13] have I given unto you as I have said
[49:16] unto Moses and if we could turn to
[49:20] Matthew amen Matthew
[49:23] 24 we all are familiar with this verse
[49:27] Matthew 24 and verse
[49:30] 35 amen it
[49:33] says
[49:36] um amen Matthew
[49:41] 24:35 see I'm trying to Oh Heaven and
[49:44] Earth shall pass away but my words shall
[49:48] not pass away if we could read that one
[49:49] more time Heaven and Earth shall pass
[49:53] away but my words shall not pass away
[49:56] way amen we ask the Lord to to bless the
[49:59] reading of the word as you can be
[50:02] seated amen if I were to give a title
[50:06] this morning I would like to to title it
[50:08] uh he is faithful to his word amen and
[50:12] brother brandham says God keeps his word
[50:15] he's got to keep his word in order to be
[50:18] God he has to stand behind everything he
[50:21] said in his word and that's exactly
[50:24] where our faith should rest is a upon is
[50:27] upon the spoken word of God Amen so if
[50:31] we go back and we look at the children
[50:32] of Israel and and and we see that they
[50:35] were in bondage in Egypt and and we know
[50:38] that God had promised them a deliverer
[50:41] amen God had made a covenant with Moses
[50:44] and that he would lead them to a land
[50:46] flowing with milk and honey and no
[50:49] matter how long it took no matter how
[50:51] many years it took and but God was
[50:54] faithful to his word and was able to to
[50:57] perform exactly what he had promised
[51:00] amen he had to call the Flies he had to
[51:03] create the frogs he had to turn water
[51:05] into blood he he had to allow death to
[51:08] come in but he was faithful to his word
[51:12] amen and and after they had uh done seen
[51:15] the glory of God down in Egypt and they
[51:18] seen God move and and perform the
[51:20] Miracles and and they seen all the signs
[51:23] and wonders that God had done and when
[51:26] they seen the pressing time come brother
[51:28] brandham says when the Red Sea had cut
[51:30] them off the deserts had cut them off
[51:33] and Pharaoh's Army was just behind them
[51:36] oh what an hour but God seems to take
[51:39] pleasure in getting his children in such
[51:41] a position amen it's strange how God
[51:44] leads his children so he brings them out
[51:46] of Egypt and now they've come upon the
[51:49] Red Sea and and Pharaoh's Army behind
[51:52] them but God loves to put his children
[51:54] in such a position for them to trust him
[51:58] amen as the poet used to say some
[52:00] through the waters and and some through
[52:02] the flood uh some through deep trials
[52:05] but all through the blood amen God has a
[52:08] way of leading his children amen it's so
[52:11] odd and peculiar amen but God's path
[52:15] happened to lead through the Red Sea
[52:17] amen and brother brandham says how
[52:19] beautiful to notice just in that crucial
[52:22] hour God waits to the very crucial
[52:25] moment H but he can speak and things
[52:28] Heap up according to his word amen he
[52:31] had promised him to take them to the
[52:34] promised land and he's obligated to keep
[52:37] his word amen he was obligated and that
[52:41] great dark crucial moment how easy it
[52:44] was for God to figure it out amen God
[52:47] didn't bring them to the Red Sea and
[52:49] then get all confused he didn't bring
[52:51] them to the Red Sea and go oh my I don't
[52:54] know what I've done I brought you here
[52:56] and Pharaoh's Army is behind you I don't
[52:58] know what to do that's not what God Said
[53:02] Amen God is obligated to keep his word
[53:05] and he says I've got the situation under
[53:08] control amen so what did he do he took
[53:11] the pillar of fire and he moved it over
[53:13] in between the Egyptians coming and it
[53:16] was light to Israel and it was dark to
[53:19] the Egyptians oh my and the Red Sea got
[53:23] scared brother brandham said it got
[53:25] scared and it walled it self up amen it
[53:28] w itself up because God's path LED
[53:31] through the middle of it and that's the
[53:34] way God does things oh my God loves
[53:37] proving himself to his
[53:40] people amen do you believe that amen God
[53:44] loves to prove that he's the same
[53:46] yesterday today and forever amen
[53:49] sometimes as humans we don't we don't
[53:52] understand why we go through certain
[53:53] things we don't understand why God
[53:55] allows us to go through certain trials
[53:58] and and go through the floods and
[54:00] Through the Fire we don't understand
[54:02] sometimes but but we must remember who
[54:05] holds tomorrow in his hands Oh my he
[54:09] promised you will see brighter days and
[54:11] he's obligated to keep his word Amen
[54:15] brother brandham says because these
[54:17] people was keeping his word because the
[54:20] Israel was keeping his word and walking
[54:23] in the light and moving on following
[54:26] God's commands everything just opened up
[54:29] for them and if you want things to open
[54:31] up for you take God at his words and
[54:34] start moving forward amen we
[54:38] get moving forward take God at his word
[54:42] don't look back just press on through
[54:44] he's obligated to be with you oh my walk
[54:49] in the light of his word as he is the
[54:51] light amen now we understand that when
[54:55] they came to the place called Kadesh
[54:57] Baria amen that was the Judgment seat
[55:00] and a testing time for all of Israel
[55:02] amen and God was all God always test his
[55:06] children by his word amen he don't test
[55:10] his children by Theology and by by
[55:12] psychology or nothing he test he tests
[55:15] his children by his word amen and
[55:18] brother Brenham says did you hear that
[55:20] God test his children by his word if you
[55:23] believe his word God test you by the
[55:26] word now if you notice there came a time
[55:29] to go over and and spy out the land amen
[55:32] they they came over and and and it come
[55:35] time they that God brought them through
[55:36] the Red Sea and and and they've wandered
[55:38] around for years but now God brought
[55:40] them to a certain place and it was time
[55:43] to to spy out the land and when they
[55:45] went over to spy out the land they they
[55:48] came back amen we all know the story and
[55:51] and 12 of them and 10 of them says well
[55:52] we can't take it it's impossible we
[55:56] can't can't do it amen because the
[55:58] cities are so wall that we are like
[56:00] grasshoppers in their sight we the
[56:03] Giants are are they're Giants in our
[56:06] eyes they they're huge the walls are
[56:08] just too big for us it's too much for us
[56:10] this trial is just too much for us oh my
[56:15] and numbers uh 13:30 says and Caleb
[56:18] stealed the people before Moses and said
[56:22] let us go up at once and possess it for
[56:25] We Are well able to overcome it amen
[56:29] Caleb and Joshua were looking at one
[56:31] thing and the 10 was looking at
[56:33] something else the 10 was looking at
[56:35] circumstances the 10 was looking at
[56:38] problems and the the 10 was looking at
[56:40] their self ideas and their self
[56:42] motivations but Caleb and Joshua was
[56:45] looking at one thing and that's what God
[56:48] Said Amen God said go and take the land
[56:52] oh my look at what God's word says I
[56:56] don't know how it's going to be done but
[56:58] God said that he would have a church
[57:00] without spot without wrinkle without
[57:03] blemish amen and I believe he's going to
[57:05] have it amen I believe he's going to
[57:07] have a bride ready for a Rapture oh my
[57:12] he's going to have it you got to believe
[57:14] it it's not up to us to know how God is
[57:16] going to do

[57:21] he will do it amen he'll part the waters
[57:24] if he has to amen just know that he's
[57:27] faithful to his word amen he said I will

[1:24:51] year uh a couple months ago la last year
[1:24:56] uh I went to the doctor for a uh due to
[1:24:59] a fo wreck I know some of the family may
[1:25:02] remember and um I I went up this hill
[1:25:05] and and uh the brakes didn't work and
[1:25:10] and I stopped I stopped on this heel
[1:25:12] because there was thorns and I stopped
[1:25:14] to brush them aside well the brakes
[1:25:15] didn't hold and the four-wheeler started
[1:25:17] going backwards and then this hill was
[1:25:20] Steep and excuse me I uh
[1:25:25] I uh downshifted on it and it still
[1:25:28] wouldn't stop I downshifted again and it
[1:25:30] went to neutral and it just went even
[1:25:32] faster down and I couldn't get it out of
[1:25:34] the gear and all I just remember was
[1:25:36] just holding on and and I would just
[1:25:38] closed my eyes and and I didn't I didn't
[1:25:41] know it was dark it was dark outside and
[1:25:43] I didn't know what what was the drop off
[1:25:47] had a it was a mountain on the side so I
[1:25:49] was on this Trail and it was just drop
[1:25:52] off on one side and and I just closed my
[1:25:54] eyes and hung on and I and I turned it
[1:25:57] real sharp to let the fo wheer fall
[1:26:00] because I didn't want to go over that
[1:26:01] mountain and and the fourwheeler landed
[1:26:05] on top of me and then just rolled down
[1:26:08] and it scared me so bad my father-in-law
[1:26:10] was on the next Ridge over and I called
[1:26:12] him and he rushed over and and he's like
[1:26:15] are you okay well I I got up and I I
[1:26:18] didn't feel anything I I I was like I I
[1:26:22] thought for sure I would crush something
[1:26:24] would have broke something and and and
[1:26:26] but God was faithful and and we went to
[1:26:29] uh and a couple day later or the same
[1:26:32] day I just had a small uh pain in my in
[1:26:35] my lower back and we had gone to get it

[1:26:41] ask me a series of questions and the
[1:26:43] doctors anytime you go they start asking
[1:26:45] you a bunch of questions and I was

[1:38:44] God's word it's the it's the yes God is
[1:38:49] faithful yes God's word is true yes I
[1:38:53] believe
[1:38:55] that
[1:38:57] that's there's where the anointing comes
[1:39:03] down and you and God become at
[1:39:12] one I was thinking of as I was listening
[1:39:17] this
[1:39:18] morning um to a message my new min
[1:39:23] history and and and brother Brandon was
[1:39:26] talking about sister Hattie right and
[1:39:28] and and how she had to come and she had
[1:39:31] to come into agreement with the
[1:39:34] word and and so he was you know he says
[1:39:39] I I I said that same Jehovah gy is
[1:39:42] trying to get his promise over to me in
[1:39:45] my thickness and dullness of mind he
[1:39:47] could speak my need into existence the
[1:39:50] same as he could speak Abraham's need
[1:39:53] into existence and I no more than said
[1:39:56] that and sister hadie sitting there
[1:39:59] crying now hadn't said a
[1:40:02] word and suddenly she said there's
[1:40:05] that's nothing but the
[1:40:08] truth she said the right thing she she
[1:40:11] said just like Banks down there I I
[1:40:14] heard her voice as it swept from my ears
[1:40:18] like up into the
[1:40:19] woods now he says and it says and that
[1:40:22] super an anointing swept over me and
[1:40:25] said tell Hattie that she's found Grace
[1:40:29] in the sight of
[1:40:31] God and he said who would have thought
[1:40:35] that's the that's the question who would
[1:40:37] have thought that that would
[1:40:40] happen and and and and he says now here
[1:40:43] stands Hattie right or sister Hattie
[1:40:46] there's the little widow woman that the
[1:40:47] miracle happened on the first bypassing
[1:40:49] all the peoples of the world and and for
[1:40:52] that thing to happen to that first to
[1:40:55] that poor little humble widow woman up
[1:40:57] on a hillside up there trying to raise
[1:41:00] corn out of crawfish ground out there
[1:41:03] and to take care of her children that's
[1:41:05] the one that God honored and and he says
[1:41:08] said I challenge anybody in the name of
[1:41:12] the Lord when that Spirit strikes and
[1:41:16] says that I don't care what you ask for
[1:41:20] it shall be done you know why the plut
[1:41:23] PRS didn't get it or or the big folks
[1:41:26] like that is because God knowed that
[1:41:29] asked things that was no good for them
[1:41:32] he gives it to people who he knows will
[1:41:36] ask the right
[1:41:39] things oh let me just come in agreement
[1:41:42] with that word Lord let me ask the right
[1:41:46] thing can you say man he says she could
[1:41:50] ask whatever she wanted but her desire
[1:41:53] was for the Salvation of her
[1:41:55] children
[1:41:57] my he he says but God knows what you're
[1:42:00] going to ask before he ever places the
[1:42:04] anointing upon you oh I just say Lord
