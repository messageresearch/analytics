here you know and when I've been in Nicaragua no electricity you know no no floor it's the same Spirit that's here and you know and if that Spirit can come down in a hut like that what can he do here you know and I believe that if we come expecting God will come on an individual level and he can speak to every individual heart because God is mindful of you God is I love that pull because I know what that's like I know what it's like to lay in bed and you've got a pull in your heart from God where you just got to pray and you don't know why you've got something inside you that you I don't know why I need to pray but I need to pray right now and all of a sudden you'll see later on why God did that and I just want to say I love every one of you God bless you I know you maybe you may be tired tonight I have no intentions of wearing anybody out tonight I just uh I just want to do what God called me to do here tonight I want to say exactly what he want me to say and you know what cuz that's obedience to his word and if we will do that we will have Victory amen so God bless you want to say we sure do love brother wend appreciate the opportunity of uh him allowing me to come uh I

of fun you know uh just just happy all the time Spirit of the Lord and just shake his hand it's just a wonderful thing so God bless you let's go right into the word this evening in Psalms 127 in verse one we want to give you a scripture and I was up at 2:30 this morning and this is uh just I was going to go a different route and then and I just felt the Lord lead me just turn me around this way and uh I thank I thank the Lord for his Mercy one scripture 127 and verse one I sure like seeing all these Bibles turning says a song of degrees for Soloman except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchmen waketh but in vain let's pray Heavenly Father we come to you this evening Lord and we want to say we love you and Lord we welcome your spirit among us tonight I ask you to lead us during this service father I ask you to speak to Hearts lead us guide us Lord Lord help me to fill your spirit in every part of the service Lord to fill your people Lord Lord God if you need to pull me to a certain different direction Lord that's the way I want to go Lord I'm a yielded vessel for you tonight be with us in Jesus name amen God bless you uh let you be seated I want to speak to you on a a thought tonight of herking diligent herking diligently unto the voice herken diligently unto the voice I think it's so important that we follow the voice of the Lord Lord the Lord is so mindful of us and you know there's a lot of people that walked with the prophet but that doesn't mean they were hearkening to the voice you know you could be best friends to to the preacher that don't mean you're hearkening to the voice but brother and sister when you are following the voice it is a it's a voice within the voice it's something inside that word and it will lead us into a Rapture one day you know I love about nature if you look at nature I love how you drive down the trees and it'll be just like normal no other change but all of a sudden one morning there'll be dog Woods bloomed all of a sudden and what is it it's a voice that spoke to them at a specific time and it said now is your time to bloom I believe the body chains will be exactly like that you know I love the Simplicity of it of an apple tree every Apple that will ever be produced in that tree is in the first seed you put that seed inside the ground every Apple that will ever be produced is already there it's got the potential and brother and sister we've got the seat of God we've got the word in our hearts and every promise of the book is already inside of the transforming power is already inside of us we just have to put it in the right atmosphere and at the right time God will cause it to do what it's supposed to do amen man has constantly been trying to increase in knowledge over the years and as we were saying well go except God keep the house we labor in vain we need God to keep us we need God to cause us to grow because you know we can do all the Motions it takes God to give the growth a farmer can do all the work that he needs to do in the field he can till the ground he can move the the Rocks he can move the sticks he can plant the seed it takes God to give the increase the water can come down it takes God to give the increase and we must have increase in our life brother and sister on an individual level we don't care we don't care what other people think about how spiritual we are the real you the real the real I the real us when we look into the mirror the one that we know when we go home and the doors shut whenever it's just us that's the real us and that's the guy I'm talking about it needs increase we need to grow in the Lord as we were saying man is constantly increasing in knowledge over the years they've increased in knowledge in astronomy architecture farming military medical and the list goes on they have increased in knowledge men have learned how to hand down Knowledge from one generation down to the other of how to make the business better and they've learned the necessity of sacrifice and security and those are very important sacrifice and and security are important and utilizing business models man has successfully built large businesses in the world and man has tried to apply those same practices to the church they've tried to do these things of saying you know what we'll run this church just like the business because you know what Walmart has grown it's a super mega store they've got churches that are super mega churches they get a lot of fruit going at where a lot of people come to church but let me ask you where is the life at where is the new birth set so we can't just go by using the model of knowledge but it takes rapturing faith it takes a spirit of a voice within a voice speaking to the people what is it it's a deep call to the Deep God will put a hunger in a people's heart God will have a word that will speak to that hunger and that's why we have a message of the hour that's why we cannot be satisfied with denominational teaching denominational word what is it there's something inside you it's a seed that needs the light of this hour to bring a full Harvest because a Luther's message will not bring that seed to a full Harvest Wesley's message will not bring it to a full Harvest we need a message of the hour today where we are in that presence where it is drawing out the Apple so to speak it's drawing out the Divine promises because it'll be what gives us the Rapture in Isaiah 55: 6- 11 it says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he's near let let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts let him return unto the Lord and have mercy upon uh him and our God he will abundantly pardon for our thoughts are not for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down in the snow from Heaven returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh to bring forth in Bud that it may give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth for out of my mouth it shall not return into me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper into the thing where unto I sent it God sent a word and it will accomplish what it's sent to accomplish how many knows there's a word for healing that word will not come back void and you when you take the Divine promise of healing by the spoken word and you go with the same attitude towards that word the same Faith toward that word God will give you the same result and God's got a word all the way down the ages for a Rapture and our our hearts in my heart brother and sister it's a pull for a Rapture and I don't believe the church will just stumble through and all of a sudden they're going to get a Rapture I believe they will be looking for it there's something inside the heart that is looking for a Rapture amen God is in is precise in all that he does and he doesn't do anything aimlessly and he doesn't have any spare parts God doesn't have any pot pieces to the puzzle for no reason let me say this to you each person in here you were designedly created for a specific person purpose God has got a specific purpose for each person here I want to know my purpose in this life I want to know what it is I want to know where I'm at because you know if you're going somewhere you have to have a map you have to know where you're going you have to know where you're at now what do I need to do to get here that's why God gave us a message that we can look and see where we're at inside this thing a watch has all these pieces in the puzzle but each each piece of the of the of the watch has a job each one has a position and when they will work in their position not anybody else's in their position everything works in harmony I love that how God has a provided way for every person there is a place in the body for each person here tonight you have a a seat that is reserved for you that's your seat but you know Satan will try to take that away and say you're just here I hate to use an example of a movie or a story but it's the best way I know how to get the example in a movie you've got somebody going down the world that nobody knows about somebody stands at the gas station nobody's about nobody knows about because the emphasis of a story is about a certain person but there are certain people now nobody knows who they are they're just people that fill the pages there are people that fills the screen you are not that person God has there's no party in here that's just somebody that's filling the pages you are important you've got a call in your life God's got something inside your heart God has a purpose in your life God wants to speak to your heart and we must hearken to the voice diligently we must listen to The Voice on a daad basis God what is my shepherd trying to tell me today what is my shepherd trying to lead me to do because I believe that we can be led by the spirit where God can speak to your heart God will land on your heart where you will speak to somebody you can be the encouragement to somebody brother BR up he could give a testimony you know Everyone likes to have the minister do the praying you ever noticed that I want the minister to pray brother Bram talked about a time where he was at a service and there was a sister that was watching this this woman with a baby going to the prayer line and the Lord laid it on her heart said you pray for that baby and she said you know what I'm just a I'm just a woman she's fixing to go before aay prophet of God who am I to pray for this baby I I'm not going to pray for this baby the Lord spoke to her again pray for that baby and the woman gets out of her seat and walks over to her imagine how she must feel this man's G to go for this before the prophet of God to pray for and she says I know you're going before this Prophet to be prayed for and I understand that sister she said but the lord has laid it on my heart to pray for your baby would it be okay with you if I prayed for your baby she said oh please please pray for the baby and this mama this mama lays her hands on this baby and pray Lord Jesus and I don't know what prayer I'm sure it was a real simple Mama's Prayer there's nothing like a Mama's Prayer a mama can break through barriers like nobody a mama has an ability to break through where nobody else can break through prayed for this baby and this woman she loses her seat and she has to go sit way up on a balcony this woman eventually goes to the prayer line and the prophet grabs a HUD over and starts to pray for the baby she said Lord father I ask you this woman this Baby's already healed amen this little woman was over here and brother bham described the story exactly said he was going through here and a little sister a little Mama Prayed for this baby and this baby was healed listen to me don't you underestimate the power of God answering your prayer where God will work through you hearken D diligently unto the voice when God lays it on your heart pray for that person don't you underestimate that we were traveling here well on on the way here and there was a man hit get by a motorcycle they're doing CPR boide the road didn't even mean to just come right out of my mouth we just begin to pray father I ask you to touch this man don't you ever underestimate your ability to reach somebody for prayer brother and sister I that's that's too simple what the what better thing can there be than you praying for somebody God answering your prayer for somebody where you can be the one that restores a family you could be the one that brings healing to a person that's been crying and pleading for mercy God help me get through this trial help me get through this battle I can't get through it you could be the person that could have that hammer and hit it just right and you can be the one that can break that Veil where they can finally get through there and have that victory that they've been wanting I'm challenge you tonight you hking to the voice you say God I want to follow your spirit I want to do my part in this body I don't want the minister to to have just I want him to do his thing but not praise God for that I want this brother to do him praise God for that I want this sister to do praise God for that God what can I do what can I do for the body of Christ CU you know it don't matter how much money we make in this life it don't matter how big our house is or how nice our car is how who have you influenced in this life who what Crown do you have that's Eternal there's so many people put all their trust all their focus on the treasures of this world that will pass away but brother and sister there's one soul that is worth 10 million Worlds the prophet talked to about hell he went to go get a sandwich one time and he couldn't get the sandwich cuz they were clothes he went across the street and he walked inside here and there was a little jukebox playing he said he saw this little woman with no clothes on and he said I thought a critical thought about this woman I thought look at this old woman the way she's dressed look at the way she's doing Lord you just wipe her off the earth and the Lord open a vision to him said you stand you walk over here for a minute I got something to talk to you about and the Lord showed the prophet how this this world was big this big big world with blood all the way around this world and he said I saw his Sins Not the woman's sins the prophet sins that were going toward the lord and there was a bumper that kept bumping that sin every single time I'm mind I think of it a prophet of God allowed himself to fall to a place where he was criticizing a woman and the Lord said let me talk to you about this a minute yeah what about you and me brother and sister you know what we have an opportunity we can criticize about oh we can say there's Mercy for you cuz the prophet needed Mercy I thank God for that that gives me Pro that gives me confidence I got confidence in a leadership that will say I'm wrong forgive me and get back in line and say this is how you do it mommy and daddy that's the best thing you can ever do is let your children say let just let them see you say I'm sorry and make it right amen praise the Lord sometimes I feel like my kids have had to se that's all dad says is I'm sorry we've had we've had a very blessed life the Lord's been very good to me but I believe that we we are the display of Mercy amen Our Lives should be surrounded by this word the word is what take makes everything go into balance into our life the word is not like a dead weight into our life but the word will actually orchestrate you and how many needs the blessings of the Lord in your life it's a Divine promise I'm going to show you let's go to Deuteronomy 28 this is just a few scriptures but I want to I want to read it Deuteronomy 28: 1-15 it says and it will come to pass if Thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on a high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee think of that overtake thee you can be overtaken by the blessing of the Lord when I think of that I'm thinking about going through and you have a flesh flood you ever seen a flesh flood yes sir I've always saw that and I imagine my mind it was water about this deep it's not that's not a flesh flood flesh flood can wipe out houses and wipe out cars wipe out everything we're talking about a blessing of the Lord that can overtake you that's right the blessing of the Lord and how do you get it by hearkening diligently to the voice that's Old Testament but it's still truth amen he says and these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt hearken into the voice of the Lord thy God blessed shall thou be in the city blessed shall thou be in the field blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of the ground the fruit of the cattle the increase of thy kind the flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be the baskets in thy store blessed shall thou be when thou comest in and blessed shall thou be when thou goest out the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before the seven ways the Lord shall command the blessing think of it the Lord shall command a blessing on you I want the blessing I want the blessing of his holy spirit I want the blessings of the promises if he says I can have it I want the blessing and I want to be overtaken by it amen the Lord shall establish Thee the holy people unto himself as he has sworn unto thee if Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God and walk in his ways and all the people of the Earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of thee think of it brother and sister the Devils around you can be afraid of you why because they hear the testimonies this is a son and daughter of God that every time we throw something at him he overcomes it no matter what I throw at him he overcomes it why because you are hening diligently unto the Lord he's naming everything that you will fight in this life in the scripture the Lord show open up his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thy hand thou shall lend into many nations and thou shalt not borrow and the Lord shall make Thee the head and not the tail who wants be the head of your circumstances yes sir listen to me if you allow it the devil will make you he will make you worship do for God only when he allows you to if you wait for the opportunity for the perfect time to pray you'll never get it if you wait for the perfect opportunity all right I'm fixing to kill this giant you'll never do it you must be the head God has called us to be the leader in our lives following his holy spirit but that mean that means it takes leadership is that right when you hearken to the voice you are following leadership listen I'm going to stop here for just a moment we live in an age today where people defy leadership kids defy police officers they def defy teachers they'll defy the ministry we live in an age where they defy parents we live in an age my wife has told me the the day that if you are 16 years old that the parent can no longer get into your medical records the 16year old has has to give them permission have they lost their mind no offense to need 16 year olds here tonight I was 16 one time too you grew out of it we live in an age where they defy authority what is it it's a spirit that will come on them and brother and sister we need leadership we must from our souls not from our minds not with our mouths I'm talking from our hearts say God I need leadership well God if you ever need to correct me from a Pulpit may I be man enough or woman enough to say yes Lord I need that amen and brother window's not here tonight so I can really open up about this listen to me when that brother has to lay the wood so to speak don't you ever think for a second that that brother goes home and says I laid the wood to them boy I let them have it I preach that don't you ever think for a second because that's a lie of a devil you go home with that brother and you'll find him broken at home saying Lord I had to do it Lord I didn't want to have to say it but I had to say it I didn't want to tell them those things but I had to do it Lord you be the minister where the Lord will lay it on your heart and said you go correct it because that how does God work through man God will work work through a Ministry that God puts in place and when that Minister steps up there he don't want to have to say those things because he's a man too because everybody wants to be a buddy say Amen you ever try to correct your buddy It Ain't Much Fun well that depends on who it is I guess I'm I'm I'm being real with you brother and sister tonight whenever you've got your closest friends you don't want to rock the boat when you've got got your closest friend it is so much easier to just go with the flow let the stuff come into church you know what they love God they're still coming to church and if he does that he is not doing you a service so when he takes out the Bel the belt so to speak remember he is not doing that to be mean listen to me young children when your parents have to do the correction don't you think for a second that they go in there and go to work the next day I'll whip my kids I can't tell you how many times I've cried after my children I remember being in the vehicle with him and I tell them that you do it one more time I'm going to whip your hand in and they do it one more time and then on the way home we're almost to the house they said Daddy I love you I can't wait to go to church I'm going to sing I'm going to be good and this flesh man says you know you know what don't whip that child but I would be lying to them if I didn't listen to me I would be lying to them if I didn't because I have to show them if Daddy says I'm going to whoop your hand in if you do it again I've got to whip your handun in not because I don't want to I do it because I love you listen to me God loves you brother and sister don't ever think whenever they come against you when they I say come against you it's the spirit if it ever comes against the way you dress the way you the women cut your hair you know the way you conduct yourself watching movies you shouldn't watch the radio missing the music you shouldn't listen to when they come against you they're not trying to be mean to you they are trying to protect you because listen to me that devil that's on that that is a devil that does that and that devil is like a cancer and he will grow he will turn into one thing after another and he will orchestrate through your life you you can tell that devil I'm just going to listen just this song I'm going to stop right here I'll just listen to this song that's all do you will not you will go into something else you will go into something else listen to me whenever that that perverted pornographic spirit that tries to come against you he will show one little thing and you can tell yourself you know what they aren't completely naked this is just a little bit it's a devil listen to me listen to what brother Daniel's telling you tonight you keep playing with that thing it will suck you right into that stuff and you won't be able to get out of it Samson thought he had it under control Samson thought he could handle dalala Samson thought you know what I can go just a little I go just a little bit with Elia and I'll pull myself out and he did it he did he he went right with El and he went right back into the presence of God praise God that Temptation come again that devil kept calling again Delilah deila kept calling him and he would be laying in bed just as we were saying uh I feel the pool the devil works just like that the devil works just like that listen to me God will always deal with your heart Satan will always work with your your mind and this is the greatest battle you'll ever fight God will always lead you to repentance God will always lead you to a a consecrated life the devil will lead you to a condemnation life listen to me if you got a spirit that's coming against you condemning you telling you you're not worthy you're you know what look at the filth you done look at this stuff you ain't worthy don't you raise your hands to God don't you praise God don't you pray you're not worthy that is not God God will lead you to repentance every time and here was Samson not meaning to he was trying to be a good person but Delila kept pulling and he said you know what I'll go one more time one more time I'll go watch this movie one more time I'll go over here one more time I'm going to go over here just I'll get away just like all the times before listen to me there come a time brother and sister where he couldn't get away he went one more time and it changed his life forever listen to me little decisions that we make in this life can change change your life forever how many men are sitting in prison right now over one decision he could have been a preacher a Preacher's Son he could have been a song leader he could have been all these things but was it one little moment and what do you remember do anybody remember him by being the preacher or the preacher son what do they remember him by by whatever he did wrong brother and sister we need to be careful and say Lord help me to be led by my spirit by your spirit Lord help me Lord to follow your word because you know what it comes back from leadership amen we need to follow our leadership praise the Lord Samson thought he can handle it and listen to me I I feel the Lord keep pulling me back to this don't trust yourself don't you ever trust yourself I can handle it you can't handle it how many times people says you know what I can handle my drinking I can just drink one beer I can drink two beer I can drink three beer I can handle it like you can't and they'll try to justify the drinking with the Bible they'll try to justify that's okay I do it just a little bit I drink just a little that's all I'm doing I know how to handle it and you know what how could how can you say drinking's wrong because you know what Jesus turn the water into wine devil that's right devil trying to reason with the word you know what why is it wrong to have just a little bit of a drink you know because if that be gluttony that's just as much as Sin you like to eat look at your belly I do like to eat but let me show you something when you show me one time where a man ate one chicken too many and killed a whole whole bunch of people going down the road you show me one person that ate one chicken too many and it caused him to go sleep with somebody else you show me one time for somebody you said well D I don't drink alcohol but there's another drunkness in this world brother and sister that people are drunk in their mind they're so drunk with the cares of life that they're just stumbling through life going with the flow with everybody else brother and sister we need to sober ourselves with the word now I believe in being drunk in the spirit God's spirit but you can be drunk with the cares of this life where all you were thinking about is this life that's right I believe God can God can get you drunk but Daniel what are you talking about you know sometimes it's it's kind of scary to face a devil you say Amen that black dog I'm not too scared of him because you know why when I stand up to him he's about right here and I'll just kick him in the head that's what I say you always tell yourself that and then it comes then you're jumping on the vehicle amen I can look at that thing and say I'm not scared of that thing cuz why cuz I'm taller than that but let me show you something you get down to that eyeball level you're that child and that dog is eyeball to eyeball all of a sudden you're afraid of that dog and that dog can comes scary that dog can be something that it just intimidates you all the time he makes you nervous all the time it's a spirit brother and sister you know I would never allow some man perverted man come into my house and torment my children or my wife there ain't no way you better be hitting the road or I'll help you I'll give you some assistance but you know what the spirits can do that same thing right in your house where they will torment intimidate and be a big bully to your children to to your wife to you and sometimes you need some help you need somebody that can kick this dog in the mouth sometimes you ever been there I can't seem to overcome this thing I need a little bit of help David had men that followed him David was a giant killer can you say Amen David killed Giants for a living and he didn't get paid for it he just did it because he liked to do it there was a spirit inside him that could kill Giants but you know his men did the same thing the men that followed David would go in if you look at the scriptures they went in there and fought men that had face of a lion when's the last time somebody fought the man with a face with a lion these guys think they're tough imagine that being on the football field they're talking about intimidating could you imagine going into the rocks and fighting a man with the face of a lion but what is it God's got Believers today that do that it's called the ministry brother and sister it's the ministry with one over here one over here one over here and they'll go and they will say you know what that gu is defying the army of the Living God let me go get him I'll go fight that devil you know that's what we need we need some more Davids and Men of David that will stand up to the devil he said you're not going to Prevail over this church you're not going to Prevail over this family we are children of the Living God we have the spirit of God and we don't have to put up with this this something inside me that stirs when I see somebody living under their privileges brother and sister your pastor is a David the ministry here are men of David and listen to me we don't we want to say you know what you got this you go fight that devil you say Amen because you know what you're going to have to fight that devil too you're going to be the Giant Killer but you know what the first time you ever killed a giant everybody had to do it for the first time everybody listen to me young people everybody had to overcome a giant the first time brother Josh when I were out on playing his basketball court and I was telling him about you know I was looking at their shots and I saw this brother Joe and he had just the absolute perfect shot flipping down I said see that's a perfect shot right there brother Joshua threw his up I said that's okay that's kind of okay shot you know no they gave the ball to me the go was here the ball went over there I said I could tell you what it is but sometimes I can't do it in the natural brother sister we can get by that but in the ministry brother and sister we can't do that when we say you can do this the ministry has got to say this is how you do it can you say Amen because you can't have confidence there my my uh reputation of a basketball player [Music] went they no longer want to hear what I had to say about shooting a basketball and I wasn't trying to make thus sayith the Lord of basketball but you understand what I'm saying brethen sister there's things in this life that's why it's so important catch this now that's why it's so important by the idol things that we speak in this life brother and sister catch this now the idol things that we speak about in this life that is why it's so careful that we are hening to the voice of the Lord because if you start talking a bunch of nonsense people around you will lose confidence in you they won't care about how much you know because they're listening listen to me we need to be led by the spirit we need to hearken to the voice Jesus said on man will speak from the abundance of his heart I love when I get around somebody and listen to them talk because I can tell they've been talking they've been thinking on the Lord I can tell I want the first thing when someone says something what kind of man is brother Miguel that man's a Christian what kind of man is K that man is a Christian what kind of a what kind of business is that that's a Christian business you want that to be number one this is a test I'm not trying to lift myself up this is the honest truth how many knows I used to sell cars yeah I did and I felt the Lord tell me to walk away from it not because I was doing anything wrong but I believe God has given me a gift to preach this gospel and I don't want to use that gift for anything else I just want to Sacred completely 100% before the Lord and I've L A lot of people to the Lord by do selling cars sometimes I sell them my car also but sometimes I just let him to the Lord but brother Timothy Miller sent me a text message today he said brother Daniel I had to just share this with you he said brother Donnie Reagan just talked about you not me personally brother Donnie Reagan was preaching and he said there ain't nothing worse than a car salesman he come back and he said I'm not going to say can't be a cares and be there he says God will work through you to prove that he can do it he said I just had to send this to you brother Daniel I like well praise God how do you take that he's my he's my good buddy and I and I took that and I was walking out on the lot and I was thinking myself Lord and I searched my heart I said Lord you know I've tried to do every single deal according to you Lord you know I've tried to lead Souls Lord you know that and I hear a page to the front and they said Daniel some customers out here want to talk to you I said I don't want to sell cars anymore I said give some they said they don't want to talk to anybody they want to talk to you okay I go out here and talk to these people and it's an old man he's probably in his 60s he got somebody else with him hey how you doing well we're talking just for a few minutes after just a couple of minutes we're start talking about the Lord you know it's my opportunity I'm talking to him about the Lord and he looked at that man he said what I tell you I looked at them and that guy said you're right I said he said I know you're looking at us like we're crazy he said we were right across the street getting a haircut and my cousin said you cannot not be a Christian and be a car cell but he said you watch I'm going to take you to one in your face devil what's the coincidence I was he was over there getting a haircut and he said I'm going to send it I'm going to send a text message to you and he's saying you can't be a Christian and God says watch this brother and sister we want our life to speak like that he said I want you to come preach for a church he said but I'm not the pastor he said the Baptist Church I said why Ain offended of that I'll preach at a Baptist any other the door open the door if God open the door I will go minister to them listen to me this is I'm challenging you tonight you want this kind of testimony to where your life where somebody can look at you say I know a real Christian let me take you to one they may not know all about the Bible they may not know about this but they know the author listen to me it's it's more important listen to me young people it's more important to know the author than to know quotes there's a lot of people in this world today they know a lot of quotes but they don't know the author and you can tell by talking to them listen to me there's a spirit inside them you can talk to a Christian just for a few minutes and you can feel that you can be in a Christian a person's home and you can tell in just a few minutes if that's a Christian what is it they are hearkening to the voice brother and sister because we can anybody can jump and Shout during service anybody can do that that's nothing but can you do it during the trial amen can you do it whenever you don't feel nothing and you say you know what I'm a Child of God brother Brenham talked about it's a lot of our attitude brother and sister we got to have a positive attitude when somebody asked me brother Daniel or how Daniel how you doing awesome not good awesome awesome that's how I'm doing awesome why because that is creating my atmosphere no matter what I'm going through I can have everything going wrong I don't know how I'm going to pay this bill how you doing awesome you know why because being in a positive attitude you are believing you're trusting I ask God to meet this need and I'm proving to him that I believe him by saying awesome because I prayed to God and he said he'll answer my prayer and you just keep moving forward I'm going to give you a couple testimonies about faith okay whenever our car business whenever in the peak of coid whenever we had absolutely no cars we used to have over 800 cars on our lot 800 it was so many car cars on our lot when I first pulled into there I felt the Lord lead me to come go sell cars I know that sounds crazy I felt the Lord lead me to go sell cars told me to sell sell my my my stump grinding business and everything and go sell cars no I did I pulled into the parking lot saw 800 cars and I pulled right back out I said forget that I can't do that get halfway down the road and I felt like I stole candy from a baby because the Lord told me to go sell cars there and I went back there and I got the job well in the peak of coid we went from 800 cars to about 50 cars 50 and we've got 10 salesmen that's not very many cars to split we're looking at buying a house and buying this house that we're looking at buying it's quite a bit more than what our other house was and I've waited for 19 years for for me to take a house because I wanted to wait on the Lord I wanted it this I listen to this I wanted to know this is God leading me to buy this house now catch this if God leads you to buy something he will give you the funds to pay for it God leads you to do something he will he will provide the funds to pay for it that's the truth and I saw the cars out there I was sitting in my I was of course approved it alone she going to do this house and and my pay car my house payments going to be quite a bit more than what it was and I'm sitting there and I am nervous I'm squirming I'm looking at the circumstances I look at these cars there's 50 cars in this huge lot I'm like you have lost your I have a window in front of my do I saw myself said you have lost your mind that's the dumbest thing you could ever do right now is go out and buy house whenever you have no you have no cars to sell you have one car on the board it's the middle of the month why would you do this and I got up I said I'm going to call my wife and tell her the news I rose up Lord is my witness I rose up I was going to call my wife say I'm sorry we're not buing the house and I felt the Lord check me he said stop leaning on the arm of your flesh and rest on me and I said Lord forgive me forgive me Lord and I went back to my office I said Lord I am so so sorry this is a testim I am not trying to lift myself this is a testimony we had 50 cars on the lot 50 prob 55 56 car pulls on the lot I said Lord I give this to you I'm not going to worry about it no more Toby breens out of the uh out of the company he went to Florida he was disgusted because we only got 50 cars and we ain't got no cars out he's just disgusted I'm sitting there and all of a sudden I said I said Lord I give this to you car pulls in they said we're looking for Daniel black said he's right over there he said I want to buy this car do you have one said actually I do I've got one trading this car right here somebody else comes up I'm looking for Daniel black do you have this car I actually I just traded for it I've got this one the other one comes in there I'm looking for Daniel black the salesman begin to get angry because every person would come in in and say I'm looking for Daniel black some of these people I don't even know they come say I'm looking for Daniel black I'm I want to buy this car and one after another after another after another after another after another sold the car sold the crate sold the car sold the trade sold the car sold the trade I had my biggest month I've ever had in the car business when we had the least cars ever listen to me whenever you are at your wits end you're like I don't know how I'm going to make these these ends meet God can do the miraculous because you know what it would not be miraculous if I had 800 cars and everything going good that's not good it would not be miraculous if Samson was 7 foot tall and full of muscles what made it miraculous is he was a little bitty boy and the spirit of the Lord come up on him and then he conquered the gates that's what made it miraculous brother and sister it wouldn't be miraculous if Moses would have delivered the children of Israel at the peak of his strength and all of his knowledge and all of his wisdom that wouldn't be miraculous what made it miraculous is he was an 80-year-old beat down man that with flabby arms he didn't have anything to offer at all except trusting in the Lord CU that's where his strength come from and that's where the church has got to be brother and sister where we're hearkening to the voice my strength is not in what I can do your finances can be gone tomorrow the presence of the Lord will be with you always the word will be with you always listen to me put this in your tool belt whenever you come to this mountain and you got this giant in front of you I don't know how I'm going to pay this bill you right then where you hking to the voice let give you one more testimony if that'll be okay I had my landscaping business several years ago I had no business going on and I had my boys with me I wish they were with me I had one of them with me no business going on and I said' Lord I need your help and I felt the inspiration hit my heart and I turned to my boys I said you're fixing to see how daddy is followed followed by the Lord we pulled the truck over God's my witness we pulled the old truck over right there beside the road I said we're going to pray right now we're going to ask God to lead us took hands right there and we prayed I said God you know I need work you know what I have need of I give this to you Lord I ask you for leadership Lord I don't know how to do it I give it to you and I began to sing songs going down the road through Picola Oklahoma going up the road there's a there's an electric company on the right side and the Lord told me turn left and I turned left we're going down the road and I'm going through here and I'm going I have no idea where I'm going but I know the Lord told me to do this I'm going down the road brother and sister and it go here and I said I have no idea and the devil tried to tried to Temp like where's he at where you going now where you going now I don't know the Lord didn't tell me yet all I'm doing is going the way he told me and that's what you got to do you you follow the last place the Lord LED you you know a sheep dog whenever they have sheep dogs they will they will follow the shepherd and if they ever lose sight of the shepherd they will take the Sheep right back to the last place they saw the shepherd the ministry does the same thing come on somebody I was following and I said I don't know where I'm going and the Lord spoke to me again says go to that house up there on the right I have work for you I go up here and I pull up and grass is really tall I got my old junky truck I got my lawn more and everything in the back of it and I walk up and I knock on the door I said hi I said I'm here to cut your alwn and she started crying she said I was on my knees praying for God to send somebody she said I've been calling people to cut my grass and nobody would answer my call she said I was on my knees praying God would you please help me get this grass cut because you know I can't walk out there brother and sister there's a deep call to the deep it was a woman that had had a need and there was a Son of God that was led by the spirit that God was going to use to help her need listen to me God wants to do that through you brother and sister God wants you to be led by the spirit when somebody needs a kind word somebody needs some inspiration somebody needs some help you can be that person you can be that person that you that person that stinks like alcohol that has a cigarette smill that is somebody that needs your help that's where you can pull them up brother and sister that's where you can be be the one that can say Hey you can have this victory that I have in my life hey you can have this Victory can you say Amen you can go to your family how many's got families with troubles how many's got family with drama okay I'm not the only one brother and sister every time I go to be with my family that is an opportunity for me to be the blessing to them because you know what that's the closest thing to eternal life that somebody ever received you can change that atmosphere where you can go through but you know if you're going through cutting their hair doing this doing that you won't lead them nowhere but brother and sister if you can pull them up and say you can have this Victory I want that I want that to where I can be herken to where I can herk where you can hearken to the voice where you can be led by the spirit I've got one more testimony then we're we're going to good grief six selling the trucks and the vehicles I was going down the road and I was talking about this vehicle and you know any good product will sell itself if you'll demonstrate it right but a lot of the reason people don't buy it if they think it's a bad product is because it was demonstrated wrong that's right people would demonstrate it wrong and people say there's nothing to that and that's what a lot of people have done with the gospel it's because they're demonstrating it wrong I was going down the road and I was talking about this vehicle all the options on that and this man was sitting to the right and the child behind me and I just felt the Lord move upon my heart that that Spirit just drop down into the truck and I had two choices I can either continue to sell this truck or I can help this brother or I can help this sister I Heard a Voice that dropped down in in the truck and it was an opportunity for me follow the spirit of God there's times when the spirit will drop in into your presence you may be washing dishes you may be doing laundry you may be doing electrical work when that Spirit drops down catch this when that Spirit drops down it's for a purpose God's not just doing it aimlessly God is wanting to lead you to do something I felt this presence dropped down in this truck and I began to use that opportunity to talk to him about the Lord I said you know what I said God is such a good god ain't he and I felt that coldness about him I said you know what let me let me just give you a testimony about what God's done in my life and the listen this the best thing you can do is share how your Li your candle got lit the greatest weapon the greatest treasure that you have is how your candle got lit don't ever let that thing become devalued I began to say you mind if I give you a testimony about how my fire got lit I began to talk to this man about how my fire got lit in the gospel and I felt that presence just from me again to drop down and I'm here to tell you I said God changed my life God turned me around god Set Me Free and this man who was cold began to cry sitting in the seat he said my wife left me he said I don't know what to do he said he said we we just he said just me and him I said let's pray right now that God will restore your family I said Do you believe God will answer my prayer he said I do we pulled the truck over and we prayed right there and said Lord I ask you to restore this family God bring peace to this family let me say God answers prayer God restored that family God restored that family listen to me there was another another on the way to work one day going to sell cars I felt the spirit of the Lord drop into the building inside my inside my vehicle and tell me you're going to pray for somebody today I felt this so strong you're going to pray for somebody I didn't know who it was I knew I was going to pray for somebody you ever felt about that going down the road and I get to work and I have no idea who it is I'm searching is this the one is this the one is this the one I don't know who it is but I know I'm going to pray for

tumor on and they're both going to die they're both bleeding in the brain he said they said we don't even know why we're here they said we were going across the parking lot and for some reason we turned in here and said we don't even know why we're here I said let me assure you I know why you're here I said the Lord told me that I'm going to pray for somebody today and I said I believe that person is you I said I'm going to pray for you right here I said God is going to heal your babies took their hands right there and prayed I said Lord and there nothing big just a fervent prayer Lord I

praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the [Music] lord we love when the Lord comes when the Lord shows his presence we we love when the sermons come together and knit together in a way that you never would have thought brother brother Daniel had no idea that the verse that he read to start Psalms 127:1 except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain when I was studying for what I was to minister this morning I had looked at that verse multiple times and could never quite see how it fit into what I was supposed to be ministering on but yet there was something I kept going back to it kept going back to it and it ties into to what brother Wendell's been preaching over the weeks and then brother Daniel comes in and just brings it out in such a a wonderful way [Music] and and then the Lord comes down and lets you know that he was ministering he was speaking that it was him inspiring it because he's the one that touches the heart it's not it's not a man it's not brother Daniel with having such an ability to to put the words together and to make it all work it's that inspiration coming behind and going hey you're my people hey you've been warned you've been spoken to you've been talked to and reminded again that hey this is for you to be doing the work this is for you to be taking the next step this would be for you to be claiming the promise this is for you to be doing the praying not just the Minister doing the praying not just the Watchman that's up there calling out that hey this is what needs to dress you have to be the one down there building the wall you have to be the one doing the praying you have to be the one doing it I think God's being very clear to each and one of us that we have our part to be doing that we have our part to be praying we have our part to be cleaning house and taking inventory because we have the spirit that keeps keeps calling out keeps pointing out keeps going look we're that close look it's just about time we're almost there it's almost time get serious get things handled get things addressed we see Satan moving like a roaring lion trying to hit with item after item thing after thing going after person after person with different different struggles with different problems with different spirits but the answer is still the same no matter what the problem is the answer is the same we turn back to Christ we turn back to applying the blood we turn back to applying the token the quote that I read at the very end of the sermon this morning then when we pray we must have the token to present with our prayers as I said and now believe for ourselves and apply the token to the whole family like in Egypt Jericho or either in Acts 16:31 we find out that Paul told the Roman Centurion say believe thou and all thy house shall be saved apply it to your family if you've got unsaved child lay the token right on top of him say Lord God I claim him stay right there if you've got a mother or a loved one that's lost lay that token on them say Lord God I claim it move out all of the worldly trash out of your house get ready for it burn up your shorts throw out your card tables get rid of your cigarettes dump your unbelief and your church papers in the trash can where they belong then you're getting ready then what do you do then apply the token in prayer with real evidence real Faith apply it apply it with confidence when you apply the token know that you are cleaned up if our hearts condemn us not then we have our request when we're able to apply the token then we will see Miracles because there's nothing to block us there's nothing to hinder us if that token is there if all the trash is gone there's nothing between us and the promise let's sing that again brother we shall see [Music] Miracles Mires we will see Giants fall walk on water this is your kingom come this is the battle one this is rival we will see Mires we will see Giants fall we walk [Music] water this is your kingom this is the battle this is [Music] Revival we will [Music] see we will see [Music] mirales praise the Lord I think we can all honestly say that the Lord was here tonight that the Lord met us and ministered to our hearts and I know that we're going to be hearing praise reports from those that brought their needs before the Lord those that came up to pray but one thing I want each of you to remember as I heard brother Daniel talking to each one of you is to remember to walk away proclaiming the promise no matter what the symptoms may look like no matter what the reports may look like no matter what the situation may be looking like around you you keep holding to the promise you keep holding to the word of God and claiming this is what it is whether I feel it this moment or or not I'm walking away healed whether I feel it right this moment or not I'm walking away free whether I feel it or not I'm walking away an overcomer you keep claiming the promise no matter what you feel like because the feelings will lie to you isn't it just good to be in the presence of the Lord it was definitely a blessing for me I and this is one you know it's even for me it's still a privilege to be invited up to be one of the ones praying I still consider that such a an honor and a different because I'm still not used to that but to feel the presence of the Lord when he comes down to feel him touching to be able to look around on the faces and see the Lord working in Hearts whether they came to the front or not not to know the Lord's still Mindful and still cares that's why we keep coming because we know the Lord cares about us and to worship him and to praise him and thank him for what he does I think we can all say it's been a good day today praise the Lord what can we sing next brother [Music] kobby [Music] moments like I sing out a song sing out a love song to Jus in moment like the I lift up my hands I lift up my hands to the Lord singing Love You Lord singing I Love You Lord [Applause] singing High [Music] love Lord love [Music] you in moments like the I sing out a song I sing out a love song to Jes Jus in moment

provide for the newly married couple sister keys I the fellowship hall is not open tonight right okay so no fellowship hall tonight if yall want a fellowship gather somewhere else I think it's been

mindfulness over every one of your children Lord we thank you for everything that that you do for us Lord everything that [Music] you all the ways that you take care of us Lord and and meet our needs
