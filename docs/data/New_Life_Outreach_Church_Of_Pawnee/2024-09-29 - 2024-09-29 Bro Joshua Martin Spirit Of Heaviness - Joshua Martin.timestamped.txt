[38:49] there's one that's walking with us and
[38:51] holding our hand amen if you have your

[38:56] of scripture Isaiah 61 And1 and Luke 4
[39:06] and18 like to say it is good to be back
[39:08] home we definitely we miss everybody
[39:10] when we're when we're are away yall are
[39:13] always in our thoughts and in our
[39:15] prayers uh we got back home yesterday we
[39:18] was there in Missouri at brother Ben
[39:20] Beard's meetings and man that they've
[39:22] been having some tremendous meetings and
[39:24] so we thank the Lord for that I think
[39:26] brother Andrew is preaching this morning
[39:27] morning and so then they have a fish fry
[39:30] after the service so I know that's
[39:33] sounds like a good time and let's just
[39:34] remember all those that'll be traveling
[39:36] back home today and tomorrow that the
[39:38] Lord will keep them safe but Isaiah 61
[39:40] And1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon
[39:43] me because the Lord hath anointed me to
[39:46] preach Good Tidings unto the meek and ha
[39:48] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[39:50] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[39:53] opening of the prison to them that are
[39:54] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[39:57] the the year of the Lord and the day of
[40:00] the Vengeance of our God to comfort all
[40:02] that mourn and to point unto them that
[40:04] mourn in Zion to give unto them Beauty
[40:06] for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning
[40:09] the Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[40:11] heaviness that they might be called the
[40:13] Trees of Righteousness the planting of
[40:16] the Lord that he may might be glorified
[40:19] you thankful for that then Luke 4 and 18
[40:22] these are just some things I've been
[40:23] studying on for the last couple months
[40:25] and I know Uncle Jonathan touch touched
[40:27] on some of these things that are
[40:28] meetings so just bear with me if I
[40:31] repeat a little bit of those things um
[40:33] but this is what's been on my heart and
[40:36] Luke 4:18 the spirit of the Lord is upon
[40:39] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[40:41] the gospel to the poor Heath sent me to
[40:44] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[40:45] Deliverance to the captives and
[40:47] recovering of the of sight to the blind
[40:50] to set at Liberty them that are bruised
[40:52] to preach the acceptable year of the
[40:54] Lord and he closed the book and gave it
[40:57] to the the minister again to the
[40:58] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[41:00] all them that were in the synagogue were
[41:02] fasten fastened on him and he began to
[41:05] say unto them this day the scripture is
[41:08] fulfilled in your ears amen can we bow
[41:11] our heads this this morning dear
[41:13] gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we
[41:15] love you Lord and we're thankful for
[41:17] your mercy God thank you for giving us
[41:19] this opportunity to come into your house
[41:21] Lord and and to sing songs of worship
[41:23] father Lord thank you for Liberty father
[41:25] that we feel here this morning Lord as
[41:28] we come into this portion of the service
[41:29] Lord I ask that you would anoint me
[41:31] Father Lord as I've studied Lord and I
[41:34] ask that you would just Lord if you need
[41:35] to move me from my notes God I ask that
[41:38] you would just have complete Liberty and
[41:39] control in in this vessel father Lord I
[41:42] Surrender myself to you Lord I ask that
[41:44] you would anoint the congregation as
[41:46] well Lord may they also get in the same
[41:48] channel Lord of inspiration and and
[41:50] receive the blessing that you have
[41:51] formed this morning Father Lord we ask
[41:54] that you would be in the meetings there
[41:55] in Galina Lord I ask that you would
[41:57] anoint brother Andrew as he would
[41:58] Minister this morning Father Lord we ask
[42:01] these things in your precious name amen
[42:03] and you may be seated if I had a a
[42:06] subject it would be the spirit of
[42:08] heaviness and brother brandham he would
[42:10] preach this day the scripture is
[42:12] fulfilled and he would say this how
[42:14] accurate is the scripture if you'll
[42:16] notice that that this in Isaiah 61:2 is
[42:19] where our Lord was reading from Isaiah
[42:22] 61:2 but in the middle of the second
[42:24] verse of Isa Isaiah 61 he stopped where
[42:27] it said the spirit of the Lord is upon
[42:30] me to preach the acceptable year then he
[42:32] stopped why the other part to bring
[42:35] judgment it didn't apply to his first
[42:37] coming but his second coming but it
[42:40] didn't apply there how the scriptures
[42:42] never make a mistake they are always
[42:44] perfect Jesus stopped just where the
[42:47] scripture stopped because that was
[42:49] exactly what was to be Vindicated in his
[42:51] day now when the first coming the second
[42:54] coming he will bring judgment upon the
[42:56] Earth but not then he was to preach the
[42:58] acceptable year of the Lord so brother
[43:01] Brandon would tell us he was picking up
[43:03] that scripture and would go to the
[43:05] second verse half of the second verse
[43:07] and would stop and would say this day
[43:09] the scripture is fulfilled and I
[43:11] believing I believe we're leaving in the
[43:12] day where all scripture is being
[43:14] fulfilled we're not living in the hour
[43:17] where scripture is being made or written
[43:19] or or prophecies are coming forth
[43:21] concerning this age but we're living in
[43:23] a time where prophecies are being
[43:25] fulfilled the very hour that we are
[43:27] living in and I believe judgment is
[43:30] coming upon the Earth something that is
[43:32] taking place right now not the Great
[43:34] Tribulation but judgments are upon the
[43:36] Earth and brother Brandon would say this
[43:39] we realize that judgment is striking
[43:41] great Faults Are Falling in and the
[43:43] nation is shaking earthquakes in diverse
[43:46] places great hysterical historical
[43:48] things that we've heard of these past
[43:51] days of judgment Through the Bible and
[43:53] we see it repeating again and he would
[43:55] say the prophecy saying as it was in the
[43:58] days of Noah so shall it be in the
[44:00] coming of the son of man as it was in
[44:02] the days of lot so shall it be in the
[44:05] coming of the son of man and we see it
[44:06] happening now men's hearts are failing
[44:09] perplexity of time distress between
[44:12] nations God we know we are at the end
[44:15] time in another place last year standing
[44:17] in the same place where Mr woods and I
[44:19] were going up the hill in the kind of of
[44:22] mourning about his wife being sick the
[44:24] holy spirit said pick up the rock laying
[44:26] there throw it up in the air when it
[44:28] comes down say thus sayith the Lord
[44:31] there will be judgment strike the Earth
[44:33] tell him that he'll see the hand of God
[44:36] in the next few hours and I like how
[44:38] brother brandom is saying that judgment
[44:40] was going to strike the Earth but he
[44:42] also gave a promise to Mr Woods that he
[44:45] was going to see the hand of God and I
[44:47] believe we're living in the day of
[44:48] judgment but at the same time we have
[44:50] seen the hand of God come to the Earth
[44:53] and we see the manifestations of it he
[44:56] will continue to say I told Mr Woods
[44:58] he's present now or present tonight and
[45:00] I guess eight or 10 of the men or 15
[45:02] that was there at the time when it took
[45:05] place the next morning where the Lord
[45:07] came down in a whirlwind ripped the
[45:09] mountain out around us and cut the top
[45:11] of the trees loose and made three blasts
[45:13] and said judgment is heading towards the
[45:15] West Coast two days after that Alaska
[45:18] almost sank beneath the Earth and since
[45:21] then up and down the coast the belches
[45:23] of God's judgment is against the
[45:25] spiritual scream so judgment is striking
[45:28] the earth now we see nation is against
[45:30] Nation uh men's hearts are failing them
[45:32] for fear we see all of that happening
[45:35] now and it's so easy to get so focused
[45:38] upon the judgments that we miss the
[45:40] beauty of the hour we we we we get so
[45:43] focused on maybe the homosexuals or or
[45:45] the white house or politics you know
[45:47] it's it's been prophesied that America
[45:49] is going to go down but it's so easy to
[45:52] get so focused on the negative that we
[45:55] fail to see that the mighty Angel has
[45:57] come down with an open book letting you
[46:00] know that Jesus Christ is here on the
[46:02] Earth today you know brother Brandon
[46:05] would tell us if he would have a choice
[46:07] to pick any day to live in it would be
[46:09] today you know not in the first day with
[46:11] the Apostle Paul but it would be right
[46:13] here because this is the fullness of
[46:15] time and brother brandom he would say
[46:17] this here he read the scripture handed
[46:20] the books back to the priest and said
[46:22] all the eyes of the people were fastened
[46:24] upon him and he looked upon them and
[46:26] said this day the scripture is fulfilled
[46:29] I read the scripture with dozen or more
[46:32] evidences that we're living in the last
[46:34] day the generation that will see Jesus
[46:37] Christ return to the Earth and I say to
[46:41] you again this day the scripture is
[46:44] fulfilled in your sight you in Tucson
[46:47] you in California you in New York on on
[46:49] the telephone hookups this day the
[46:52] scripture is fulfilled in your sight
[46:55] brother brandom says that we're living
[46:57] in the day where the generation is going
[46:59] to see The Return of Jesus Christ upon
[47:02] the Earth and he would say this day the
[47:05] scripture is fulfilled brother Brandon
[47:07] would tell us he's here in every aspect
[47:10] but the Corporal body his word is here
[47:12] his presence is here letting you know
[47:15] that you can make it through the
[47:17] judgments that are upon the earth now
[47:19] you can make it through it and I say
[47:21] here in PA e this day the scripture is
[47:24] fulfilled we're not waiting for
[47:25] something to come to reveal Christ we're
[47:28] not waiting for another message to come
[47:31] and open up the seals but we had a
[47:33] message come and reveal to you what was
[47:35] under those seals you see the seals
[47:38] ain't something so complicated that we
[47:40] can't understand but brother Brandon
[47:42] would tell us that he's the one that
[47:44] opened the seals not brother brandom but
[47:46] he's the one that opened the seals and
[47:48] he says what was those seals it was
[47:51] Christ so when the book came open in
[47:53] this generation we can see the Christ
[47:56] a't Million Miles Away but Christ is
[47:59] here revealing to you that he's the same
[48:02] yesterday today and forever in the time
[48:05] of mourning there's an anchor that can
[48:08] bring you through it brother the Brandon
[48:09] would say look what we've seen in this
[48:11] day the quickening power has come to
[48:14] open the Seven Seals what was that the
[48:17] intelligence of a man no the quickening
[48:20] power of God see the quickening power of
[48:22] God foretold that this would take place
[48:25] see the quickening power of God
[48:27] made the world to testify of it it's the
[48:30] truth the angel of the Lord I told you
[48:32] was around the pillar of fire quickening
[48:34] power let the world testify that it's
[48:36] the truth and in that they didn't know
[48:39] what it was we knew just look this way
[48:42] and it was our Lord up there he was
[48:43] talking about Mount Sunset and in that a
[48:46] lot of this is coming from the rising of
[48:48] the Sun and brother brandom at the
[48:50] beginning of that would talk about Mount
[48:52] Sunset and would say they couldn't see
[48:54] what it was because they wasn't
[48:56] predestinated to it but here brother
[48:59] Brandon would say he's the one that
[49:01] opened those seals he is those seals for
[49:04] the whole word of God is Christ and
[49:06] Christ is the seals that was open what
[49:09] is the opening of the seals then
[49:11] revealing Christ and so what was Mount
[49:14] Sunset it wasn't a man up there it was
[49:17] our Lord the mighty angel coming down
[49:19] with an open book in hand letting you
[49:22] know that this is the time the
[49:24] judgment's upon the Earth but at the
[49:26] same time I'm coming to the Earth
[49:28] fulfilling my word not in Jesus body but
[49:32] in your body not just in a prophet not
[49:34] just in a preacher but in leoty in a
[49:37] young man in a mama and or in a Daddy
[49:40] it's the it's the mighty Angel giving
[49:42] you a book and says here is your
[49:44] Authority it's the quickening power
[49:46] making the word live and brother Brandon
[49:49] would tell us this here and he would say
[49:51] now we see his association with the word
[49:54] he is the word that is who he is the
[49:57] word is the word in his name in John 1:1
[50:01] where it says in the beginning was the
[50:02] word the root from where we get or
[50:04] translation the word is logos and which
[50:07] means the with the thought or concept it
[50:10] has a double meaning of thought and and
[50:13] speech now a thought expressed is the
[50:15] word or words isn't that wonderful and
[50:18] beautiful so John says the concept of
[50:21] God was expressed in Jesus so the very
[50:25] concept who God was was expressed in the
[50:28] body of Jesus Christ but the Brandon was
[50:30] say in another place the very substance
[50:33] of God was made flesh and dwelt among us
[50:37] and so the body of Jesus was the
[50:39] Fulfillment of word and of the word and
[50:42] what did we get in this generation not
[50:44] the body of Jesus but the body word of
[50:47] the son of man letting you know that the
[50:49] same power that was in the New Testament
[50:52] was the same power in the Old Testament
[50:55] is here today for fulfilling his word
[50:57] one more time not in one body but a
[51:00] multi-member body oh that should give us
[51:03] something to Rejoice about knowing that
[51:05] God has not left us here by yourself but
[51:09] he is with us every step of the way oh
[51:12] my the very substance of God was made
[51:15] flesh and dwelt among us and so if the
[51:17] quickening power has come in this
[51:19] generation to open the seals and those
[51:22] seals was Jesus Christ that means all of
[51:25] who God is is has been given to this
[51:28] generation the very substance of who God
[51:31] is not the Corporal body but the very
[51:33] being the supernatural The Presence of
[51:36] Jehovah has come back to the earth once
[51:39] again but the brand would say this may
[51:41] God Begin by his Spirit to give us
[51:44] continuous lifegiving and prevailing
[51:46] Revelation oh if the church could only
[51:49] get a fresh Revelation and become by it
[51:52] the Living Word manifested we would do
[51:55] the greater work works and glorify God
[51:58] our Father in heaven so he would say if
[52:01] the Holy Spirit would give us continuous
[52:04] Life Giving Revelation what is the holy
[52:06] spirit it was Mount Sunset the
[52:08] quickening power coming and revealing to
[52:10] you there's a revelation here that would
[52:13] give you a prevailing power and I like
[52:15] how he would say it uh get a fresh
[52:17] Revelation and become by it the Living
[52:20] Word manifested so once you get this
[52:23] quickening power you would be the Living
[52:25] Word manifest and you will do the
[52:28] Greater Works oh you see John 14:12
[52:31] ain't something for brother Brandon but
[52:32] it's for you to do the Greater Works you
[52:35] believe that this morning and I like
[52:37] that brother Brandon is putting that if
[52:38] you can get a fresh Revelation and
[52:41] become by it you will be the Living Word
[52:44] manifested I don't believe we're serving
[52:46] a dead God or or a dead letter but we
[52:49] are the Living Word manifested and my
[52:51] opening scripture would say that we can
[52:54] be the Trees of Righteousness and you
[52:56] see a tree is per is bringing forth
[52:59] blossoms bringing forth fruits and I
[53:01] believe that's what we are to have not
[53:04] the spirit of heaviness not not ashes
[53:07] but in the midst of that we are a tree
[53:09] of righteousness that has swapped or
[53:12] ashes for beauty that has swapped our
[53:15] mourning for joy that has swapped the
[53:17] spirit of heaviness for the Garment of
[53:20] Praise because wherever you are planted
[53:23] in is what you are going to Bear if you
[53:25] are planted in heaviness you're going to
[53:28] produce heaviness you're going to
[53:30] produce uh mourning you're going to
[53:32] produce depression but if you are
[53:34] planted in this word the lifegiving
[53:37] substance of Revelation you are the tree
[53:40] of righteousness producing the the
[53:43] Greater Works producing the Revelation
[53:45] in flesh brother Brandon would say in
[53:48] Psalms 1 and3 and he shall be uh he
[53:51] shall be like a plant like like a tree
[53:53] planted by the rivers of water that
[53:55] bringeth forth fruit in his season his
[53:58] Leaf also shall not wither and
[54:01] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper oh man
[54:04] if the tree is planted by the rivers of
[54:06] water it bringeth forth fruits in his
[54:09] season and so the season that the fruit
[54:12] is to be manifested if he's planted in
[54:14] the right things he's going to bring it
[54:17] forth but you got to make sure you're
[54:19] planted in the right things and brother
[54:21] Brandon or Jeremiah 17:7 the Bible would
[54:25] say blessed is the man that trusteth in
[54:27] the Lord whose hope the Lord is for he
[54:30] shall be as a tree planted By the Waters
[54:34] that spreadeth out her Roots by the
[54:36] river and shall not see when the heat
[54:39] cometh but her Leaf shall be green and
[54:41] shall not be careful in the year of
[54:44] drought neither shall cease from
[54:46] yielding fruit and I think that's an
[54:48] incredible thing it's saying that when
[54:50] the heat comes if it's planted by the
[54:53] rivers of water and when the heat comes
[54:55] it's Ro is still going to remain oh
[54:58] we're living in the most wicked age that
[55:00] there is the greatest battle ever fought
[55:02] is right in the mind we feel the
[55:05] pressure we feel the heat we feel
[55:07] anxieties and depression but in the
[55:10] midst of that we are planted in the
[55:13] right thing and the fruit is not
[55:15] withering up by depression but it is
[55:17] still producing the Greater Works even
[55:20] in the midst of anxiety and Insanity
[55:24] there's somebody that is still producing
[55:27] the fruits of righteousness oh we are a
[55:30] tree that is planted in the midst of
[55:32] judgment there is still fruit oh my
[55:35] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[55:37] last plague in Egypt was death not
[55:39] spiritual death but natural death and he
[55:42] would say the last plague here today is
[55:44] not a natural death but a spiritual
[55:47] death and so Rel living in that time
[55:49] where the the church members are coming
[55:51] to church but they're dead why they
[55:53] liveth but in the midst of that there
[55:56] was a lifegiving source called
[55:58] prevailing Revelation the Bible would
[56:00] say now the Lord is the spirit and where
[56:02] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[56:04] liberty so where the where the
[56:07] quickening power is there's a fruit that
[56:10] can be manifested inside of your life
[56:13] it's the Living Word pushing back the
[56:16] darkness so that there can be a tree of
[56:19] righteousness oh it's pushing back the
[56:21] heaviness the Bible would say in 2
[56:23] Corinthians for God who commanded the L
[56:26] the shine out of Darkness has also
[56:29] shined in our hearts to give the light
[56:31] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[56:34] the face of Jesus Christ for the God who
[56:37] commanded he didn't ask and said please
[56:40] Darkness move back or or I beg you but
[56:43] he commanded and that Living Word the
[56:45] loost would begin to brood over the
[56:48] darkness and would push it back and the
[56:51] Apostle Paul is saying has also shine in
[56:54] our hearts in other words the the same
[56:56] God that commanded uh chaos to bring
[56:59] forth order is the same God that has
[57:02] commanded order inside of our life in
[57:05] this generation oh it's the same light
[57:07] that has come and pushed back the
[57:09] darkness pushed back the heaviness so
[57:12] that there can be fruit oh it was God
[57:15] commanding let there be light it's the
[57:17] same Living Word restoring order in
[57:20] order to bring forth the Trees of
[57:22] Righteousness and this here is where I I
[57:24] would get this thought from it's in the
[57:26] rising of the Sun but the Brandon would
[57:28] say now the Sun at the rising of the sun
[57:30] well there was a time when the world was
[57:32] laying in utter Darkness it was without
[57:35] form it was void it was covered with
[57:37] water and was laying in the dark dismal
[57:40] gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God
[57:43] moved upon the water and said let there
[57:45] be light and God had a reason to do that
[57:48] for down beneath the water were seeds
[57:51] that he had planted and had to have that
[57:54] sunlight to make it live and so the sun
[57:57] didn't put the seeds there but the sun
[57:59] came because there were seeds there I
[58:02] think that's a beautiful thing because
[58:03] the message didn't make you a son the
[58:06] message came because you were a son it
[58:09] was the sunlight coming and go pushing
[58:12] back the heaviness pushing back the
[58:14] darkness so that there can be a tree of
[58:16] righteousness bloom in the midst of the
[58:19] judgments upon the earth oh Hallelujah
[58:22] brother Brandon will continue on to say
[58:24] and the first light that was ever given
[58:26] given on the Earth was God's spoken word
[58:29] the first life that ever struck the
[58:31] Earth was God's spoken word he said let
[58:33] there be light and there was light that
[58:35] turned Darkness into light in order to
[58:39] bring forth a creation of joy in life
[58:42] upon the Earth and so when the sunlight
[58:45] would push back the darkness it would
[58:48] bring forth the creation of joy you see
[58:51] I don't believe that this message is a
[58:53] message of condemnation you believe that
[58:56] this morning it's not a message of
[58:58] condemnation but it's a message of hope
[59:00] it's a message of Grace it's a message
[59:03] of promises that you're not going down
[59:05] defeated but you're going to oh but
[59:07] you're going to overcome but we needed a
[59:10] light to come in the midst of our
[59:13] darkness and bring forth a joy oh you
[59:16] see we're not meant to be depressed all
[59:17] the time we're not meant to be be bogged
[59:20] down by anxiety all the time but the
[59:23] light has brought some joy and the Bible
[59:25] would say Psalms 89 and5 blessed is the
[59:28] people that know the joyful sound they
[59:31] shall walk oh Lord in the light of thy
[59:34] countenance so blessed is the people
[59:37] that know the joyful sound and I believe
[59:39] he got that joyful sound in this
[59:41] generation what is this message it's the
[59:44] gospel trumpet proclaiming the
[59:47] acceptable year of the Lord and it's a
[59:49] joyful sound that is comforting all that
[59:52] mourn cuz the Bible would say my opening
[59:54] scripture Isaiah 6 1 and 2 to proclaim
[59:57] the acceptable year of the Lord and the
[59:59] day of Vengeance of our God to comfort
[1:00:02] all that mourn Matthew 5 and four
[1:00:04] blessed are they that mourn for they
[1:00:07] shall be comforted brother Brandon would
[1:00:09] call up a Year of Jubilee and he would
[1:00:11] say if you was a slave back back in the
[1:00:13] Bible days if you was a slave or you was
[1:00:16] in prison and had to give a son to pay a
[1:00:18] debt or a daughter to pay a debt he
[1:00:21] would say there would come the Year of
[1:00:22] Jubilee and he would say they would they
[1:00:25] would they would bring forth the trumpet
[1:00:26] and when the trumpet sounded it didn't
[1:00:29] matter if you was a slave if you was a
[1:00:31] prisoner once you heard the trumpet
[1:00:33] sounded you can go free but if you
[1:00:36] desired to remain a slave he would say
[1:00:39] you would be marked yall remember that
[1:00:41] he would say they would take you to the
[1:00:42] temple and would put a would put a hole
[1:00:45] inside of your ear and you would be
[1:00:47] marked as you're a slave for the rest of
[1:00:49] your life but you see even though the
[1:00:52] joyful sound would bring forth Liberty
[1:00:55] if if you remain or desired to remain a
[1:00:58] slave the joyful sound would not do
[1:01:01] anything for you and I believe this
[1:01:03] message is a joyful sound that's the
[1:01:06] Year of Jubilee that you don't got to
[1:01:08] stay in that heaviness but we still have
[1:01:12] a choice in order to remain in the
[1:01:14] heaviness or to be a tree of
[1:01:17] righteousness you see because because
[1:01:19] influences is going to persuade us it's
[1:01:22] going to push us either towards the
[1:01:24] things of God or away from the things of
[1:01:27] God and brother Brandon is saying there
[1:01:28] in the rising of the Sun that when the
[1:01:30] sun rose over the Earth there was a
[1:01:33] gloomy atmosphere but once it Rose over
[1:01:36] that Earth it would bring forth the
[1:01:38] creation of joy and I believe this
[1:01:41] message can bring forth a creation of
[1:01:43] Joy if you're tired of heaviness there's
[1:01:46] a creation of joy for you if you're
[1:01:48] tired of the Blues there's a creation of
[1:01:50] joy for you if you're tired of
[1:01:52] depression if you're if you're mourning
[1:01:54] you can be com it there's a creation of
[1:01:57] joy you can walk in the lights of his
[1:02:00] countenance David would say in my
[1:02:02] presence is the fullness of joy oh not
[1:02:05] in the presence of the critic but in thy
[1:02:08] presence is the fullness of joy and what
[1:02:11] did we get in this generation The
[1:02:13] Presence of Jehovah has come down the
[1:02:15] the the has come down and let you know
[1:02:18] that I am walking upon the Earth today
[1:02:20] what brother brandom say my Ministry is
[1:02:22] to declare that he is here he says we've
[1:02:25] had many find preaching many find
[1:02:27] pastors many find evangelists but I'm
[1:02:30] trying to bring to you the reality of
[1:02:32] his presence in other words he's not a
[1:02:35] million miles away but he is here and in
[1:02:39] his presence is the fullness of joy oh
[1:02:42] Hallelujah not the fullness of
[1:02:44] depression but the fullness of joy where
[1:02:47] you don't got to mourn anymore you don't
[1:02:49] got to be in depression anymore but
[1:02:51] there is a creation of joy that has come
[1:02:54] by this light oh we don't got to be in
[1:02:57] the Blues we go through hard times we go
[1:02:59] through situations we go through through
[1:03:01] circumstances but that don't got to
[1:03:03] weigh us down there's a message a joyful
[1:03:06] sound that can bring us through every
[1:03:09] situation that we go through oh
[1:03:12] Hallelujah but the Brandon would say
[1:03:14] notice now as the Gloom covered the
[1:03:16] earth and the seeds could not live
[1:03:18] without the Su into rise and the Gloom
[1:03:21] covered the earth now when the S wind
[1:03:24] was risen all the Gloom was vanished by
[1:03:27] the light as it spread across the
[1:03:29] Nations and the people oh so not just
[1:03:33] countries but the people you see this
[1:03:35] ain't a group message it's a personal
[1:03:38] message so it didn't just go to Nations
[1:03:40] it went around the world what seven
[1:03:42] times I believe brother the brandom says
[1:03:44] but it didn't just go to the world it
[1:03:46] went to the people oh this message
[1:03:49] didn't just come the p e but it come to
[1:03:51] people individuals that is in human
[1:03:54] flesh that has a weaknesses that has
[1:03:57] Sorrows that has scars that has pains
[1:03:59] hurts that has been hurt by words been
[1:04:02] hurt by actions the message come to
[1:04:05] people and the Gloom can be vanished by
[1:04:07] the light oh hallelujah how many's ever
[1:04:10] been hurt before man You' never been
[1:04:13] hurt before man I've been hurt by words
[1:04:15] I've been hurt by actions but this
[1:04:17] message is a light to come and push back
[1:04:19] the Gloom oh man how many's ever been
[1:04:21] hurt by a parent before you know it's
[1:04:24] it's sometimes bitterness can rise up
[1:04:26] but it's a light coming to push it back
[1:04:29] and say you're not meant to be a
[1:04:30] representative of Gloom you're to be a
[1:04:33] representative of the tree of life you
[1:04:35] know brother brand would say Jesus was
[1:04:37] that tree of life oh man so we are
[1:04:39] producing the very fruits that Jesus was
[1:04:43] producing upon the earth oh my when
[1:04:45] Christ Rose it pushed back the Gloom but
[1:04:48] if the people have a choice to remain in
[1:04:51] the Gloom it would do no good for him
[1:04:53] you see the Bible would tell us in Luke
[1:04:55] 24 and three and they entered in and
[1:04:57] found not the body of Jesus and it came
[1:04:59] to pass as they were perp as they were
[1:05:02] much perplexed there about behold two
[1:05:05] men stand stood by them in shining
[1:05:07] garments the word perplexed in the Greek
[1:05:10] means at a loss of way Webster's
[1:05:13] definition means filled with uncertainty
[1:05:16] or puzzled and so we would see that they
[1:05:18] were they were perplexed there were them
[1:05:21] brother bandam would use that word a
[1:05:23] Gloom or fog as a loss of their ction or
[1:05:26] confusion and here we would see that
[1:05:29] when these when these two ladies would
[1:05:31] come by the BR the Bible would tell us
[1:05:33] that it was at the rising of the Sun and
[1:05:35] brother brandom he would use that
[1:05:36] scripture for the rising of the Sun that
[1:05:38] they would come to the supplier of where
[1:05:41] Jesus was buried but yet they were
[1:05:43] perplexed even though the sun was up
[1:05:47] could you imagine that even though
[1:05:48] brother Brandon would talk about if the
[1:05:50] sun is shining outside and he says how
[1:05:53] how crazy would a man be to go in the
[1:05:55] basement and close the close the blinds
[1:05:58] and says there's no sun and he would
[1:06:00] stay in the darkness and say there's no
[1:06:02] such thing as a sun he says how crazy
[1:06:04] would that man be because there is a son
[1:06:08] but he has shut himself up from it and
[1:06:10] here comes these two ladies to the
[1:06:12] supplier of Jesus but yet they were
[1:06:14] confused even though the sun was up but
[1:06:17] you see brother Brandon would say this
[1:06:19] here and and she said whence cometh the
[1:06:22] mother of my lord for as soon as the
[1:06:24] salutation come in my ears my baby
[1:06:27] leaped in my womb for Joy Hallelujah yes
[1:06:29] sir oh brother we are not in a fog we
[1:06:32] know where we are at another place he
[1:06:35] just thought we was a bunch of Holy
[1:06:37] Rollers or fanatics but he found out we
[1:06:39] were not lost in the fog we knew where
[1:06:42] we were going another place those
[1:06:44] Spirits are just like a shadow like a
[1:06:47] like a big Dark Cloud standing there
[1:06:49] just like a fall cold and indifferent
[1:06:52] and so heaviness that comes over you is
[1:06:55] Spirit
[1:06:56] Spirits oh it's Spirits coming to cause
[1:06:59] confusion and here were these young
[1:07:01] ladies they were confused but then there
[1:07:04] would come a message oh Hallelujah here
[1:07:06] would come a message and would say why
[1:07:08] seek ye the living among the dead yeah
[1:07:12] ain't that incredible why seek the
[1:07:14] living among the dead in other words
[1:07:17] you're you're looking through gloomy
[1:07:18] eyes you're looking through fog you're
[1:07:21] looking through confusion and you're
[1:07:23] never going to find him that way but the
[1:07:26] son is up to banish all of the confusion
[1:07:30] and the Bible would say in Luke 24:5 and
[1:07:32] the and as they were afraid and bowed
[1:07:34] down their faces to the Earth they said
[1:07:37] unto them why seek ye the living among
[1:07:40] the dead he is not here but he is risen
[1:07:43] remember how we spoke I spake unto you
[1:07:46] when he was yet in Galilee saying the
[1:07:48] son of man must be delivered into the
[1:07:51] hands of sinful men and be crucified and
[1:07:54] the third day rise again and they
[1:07:57] remembered his words oh so here they
[1:08:00] were they were confused they was in a
[1:08:02] fogginess they was in a confused state
[1:08:05] but then there would come a message and
[1:08:07] would say why seek the living among the
[1:08:09] dead and that would bring the bring up a
[1:08:12] remembrance a prophecy concerning that
[1:08:15] day oh the Angels didn't bring something
[1:08:18] new it just brought back to remembrance
[1:08:20] what was already spoken concerning that
[1:08:23] day but they were so focused upon the
[1:08:26] persecution that they fail to see that
[1:08:29] the Sun is up and I say this message has
[1:08:32] brought back to remembrance what was
[1:08:34] prophesied for this generation don't get
[1:08:37] so focused upon the anxieties around us
[1:08:40] that we fail to remember his words that
[1:08:43] he says I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:08:45] forsake you but I will be with you to
[1:08:47] the end of the age I will be with you
[1:08:50] not just an angel not just a dead letter
[1:08:53] but I will be with you until till the
[1:08:55] end of it don't be confused don't live
[1:08:58] in a fog but my son has come H the son
[1:09:01] has risen to push back the fog oh
[1:09:05] Hallelujah and don't seek the living
[1:09:07] among the dead and I believe that
[1:09:09] whatever you wave in front of your
[1:09:11] family whatever you wave whatever you
[1:09:14] lift up in front of yourself is what is
[1:09:16] going to influence you because here was
[1:09:19] Jesus risen up but they were perplexed
[1:09:22] because they were so focused upon the
[1:09:24] negativity and the Bible would tell us
[1:09:27] if I be lifted up I will draw all men
[1:09:30] unto me I will draw all men unto me so
[1:09:33] whatever you lift up is what is going to
[1:09:36] draw you you remember the story where
[1:09:38] the Brandon would tell about the five
[1:09:40] sons that were in the Navy y y'all
[1:09:42] remember that story and he would say
[1:09:44] there was nobody in their family history
[1:09:46] that was ever in the military and the
[1:09:48] and the parents were confused because as
[1:09:51] soon as the oldest grew up he went into
[1:09:53] the Navy the second oest went into the
[1:09:55] Navy all five of them would raise up or
[1:09:58] grow up and would go into the Navy and
[1:10:00] but the brandom says they were confused
[1:10:02] because they didn't know how this was
[1:10:04] happening cuz what made them do this and
[1:10:06] they started to investigate it and
[1:10:07] brother brandom says that inside of
[1:10:09] their bedroom was a picture of a ship
[1:10:12] that was upon the ocean y y'all remember
[1:10:14] the story and brother brandom says every
[1:10:16] night before they would go to bed they
[1:10:19] would look at that picture every morning
[1:10:21] they got up they would look at that
[1:10:22] picture so what was lifted up before
[1:10:25] them drew them out of their family
[1:10:28] history and changed the course of their
[1:10:30] family Direction and put them on another
[1:10:33] course and if a a picture of a natural
[1:10:36] sea a natural ship can do that what
[1:10:39] about Jesus what about this message if
[1:10:41] you lift it up it can change the course
[1:10:44] of family history oh you see
[1:10:46] generational curses were passed down
[1:10:49] from generation to generation but if I
[1:10:52] be lifted up I will draw on men unto me
[1:10:54] where not to lift up family gener family
[1:10:57] curses things that have been passed down
[1:10:59] from generation to generation that is
[1:11:02] gloominess it's heaviness that is trying
[1:11:04] to keep you from your potential but if I
[1:11:07] be lifted up if the Sun is up if you
[1:11:10] point the children to the sun Point your
[1:11:13] family to the sun it will draw all men
[1:11:16] unto me oh you see the word draw means
[1:11:20] to lead with an inward power in other
[1:11:22] words if I be lifted up I will eat
[1:11:25] generally draw them oh they might not
[1:11:27] hear my voice naturally but there's
[1:11:30] predestination on the inside that I am
[1:11:33] drawing them to my side the Bible would
[1:11:36] say where the carcass is there the
[1:11:38] Eagles will be gathered will be draw
[1:11:41] would inwardly be drawn unto me oh not
[1:11:44] lead buzzards but lead Eagles and so if
[1:11:47] I be lifted up I will draw the Eagles
[1:11:50] unto me because you see the devil had
[1:11:52] claims upon families here y'all know
[1:11:55] that generational curses are claims upon
[1:11:58] marriages it's claims upon your mind
[1:12:00] it's claims upon your children
[1:12:03] pornography can be acclaimed and it's
[1:12:05] passed from generation to generation
[1:12:07] tempers is a claim that can be passed
[1:12:10] from generation to generation it's the
[1:12:13] devil it's it's heaviness that would
[1:12:15] have a claim upon family Generations but
[1:12:18] when the sun rose the sun claimed you oh
[1:12:22] brother brand I going say another thing
[1:12:23] that is still signif
[1:12:25] his ownership the seal has a mark on it
[1:12:28] it shows ownership and when you are
[1:12:30] bought by the blood of Jesus and sealed
[1:12:33] by the Holy Ghost you no longer belong
[1:12:36] to the world or anything pertaining to
[1:12:38] the world you are owned by God you're no
[1:12:42] longer are owned by the world you are
[1:12:44] owned by God the Apostle Paul would say
[1:12:46] I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ I'm no
[1:12:49] longer a prisoner to sin or the things
[1:12:52] of the world but I am owned by something
[1:12:55] else you know but the Brandon would talk
[1:12:57] about the abstract and the title deed he
[1:12:59] would say you can have the title deed
[1:13:01] but if there if there ain't an abstract
[1:13:03] on it it don't belong to you because
[1:13:05] there can be leans against it you
[1:13:07] remember him talking about that and he
[1:13:09] would say there was leans upon us and he
[1:13:12] would say brother when you get courage
[1:13:14] enough uh enough to step out and go toe
[1:13:17] to- Toe with the devil and Scat him off
[1:13:19] if I went in my house and I had a legal
[1:13:22] deed for my house if I went in there and
[1:13:25] someone was laying there drinking and
[1:13:27] carrying on carrying on and I say you
[1:13:30] have to get out friend well this is a
[1:13:32] house for human beings I've got a right
[1:13:34] to be here I'd say no you don't I
[1:13:37] possess this house it is mine well he
[1:13:40] would say I got a right just like
[1:13:41] sickness into the body or sin whatever
[1:13:44] it is say well the other ones drink the
[1:13:46] others do this others do this way but he
[1:13:49] has no legal rights I could take my
[1:13:51] abstract deed down to the courts and say
[1:13:54] look here someone is in here that does
[1:13:57] not belong to me it's because I have an
[1:14:00] abstract deed to the property so not
[1:14:03] just a title but an abstract that clears
[1:14:06] off every lean that is against him and
[1:14:09] so a family a generational curses or
[1:14:12] leans that comes up against you brother
[1:14:14] Brandon would talk about uh the the girl
[1:14:17] that had the had epilepsy and brother
[1:14:19] Brandon would say that this this curse
[1:14:21] or this illness would come from the
[1:14:23] grandparents it would come from Grand
[1:14:25] parents to her parents now she is
[1:14:27] struggling with this illness but brother
[1:14:29] brandom he would say this here but when
[1:14:31] the abstract came and struck it off
[1:14:34] everything was omitted and so when the
[1:14:37] abstract come to that little girl that
[1:14:40] had a family a generational curse that
[1:14:42] claim that the devil had upon her was
[1:14:45] broken and now she was claimed by
[1:14:48] something else and I say Lord let me be
[1:14:50] desperate for my children let me make
[1:14:53] sure they are claimed by the message not
[1:14:55] claim the message but the message claim
[1:14:58] them let the quickening power come on
[1:15:00] the inside and open the seals to the end
[1:15:03] you know the seals can be open but if
[1:15:05] you if you don't got a revelation of it
[1:15:07] it's not going to be open to you but if
[1:15:10] the same quickening power that open the
[1:15:12] seals can come on the inside it will
[1:15:14] reveal the seals to you not only to you
[1:15:17] but to your
[1:15:19] children oh hallelujah we're living in
[1:15:21] the day man where where I I get nervous
[1:15:24] with my children being teenagers there's
[1:15:27] lesbians homosexual Spirits how do I
[1:15:29] know that my children are going to make
[1:15:32] it I don't know that but by the claiming
[1:15:34] power of the quickening power that's the
[1:15:37] only way we can have hope for our
[1:15:39] children is knowing if they can ever get
[1:15:41] the quickening power on the inside of
[1:15:44] their life it claims them you know
[1:15:46] brother Brandon would say when when you
[1:15:48] get the Holy Ghost God is sealed in and
[1:15:50] the devil is sealed out and brother the
[1:15:52] Brandon must say then you are wrapped in
[1:15:54] the life of the blood sell of Jesus
[1:15:56] Christ that means if you're wrapped in
[1:15:59] something before the devil can get to
[1:16:01] you he's got to get through what you are
[1:16:03] wrapped in right but brother brand would
[1:16:05] say many people say that the devil made
[1:16:08] me do it he says no the devil didn't
[1:16:10] make you do it you just wasn't sealed
[1:16:12] yet because he says once you are sealed
[1:16:14] the only way the devil can get to you is
[1:16:17] to be justified Sanctified and filled
[1:16:19] with the Holy Ghost then he's your
[1:16:21] brother so if you're wrapped inside of
[1:16:24] the life of the blood shell which is the
[1:16:26] quickening power there's no way the
[1:16:29] devil can get to you there's no way he
[1:16:31] can get to your children if they are
[1:16:33] ever wrapped oh Hallelujah with the
[1:16:36] quickening power and every H and every
[1:16:39] claim is struck off then they are
[1:16:41] wrapped in the blood cell of Jesus
[1:16:43] Christ oh Hallelujah you see Rahab
[1:16:47] should have been another statistic right
[1:16:49] she her house was upon the walls the
[1:16:51] Bible would tell us that that she her
[1:16:53] house was upon the walls and could you
[1:16:55] imagine whenever the children whenever
[1:16:57] these spies would talk to reab and
[1:17:00] letting her know that the judgment's
[1:17:02] coming here she was living in the city
[1:17:04] where judgment was coming to she should
[1:17:07] have been another statistic right Austin
[1:17:09] you should be another statistic brother
[1:17:11] the mar should be another statistic your
[1:17:13] marriage should be another statistic and
[1:17:15] here is Rahab that was sitting upon the
[1:17:18] walls looking out the window maybe and
[1:17:21] saying the children of Israel marching
[1:17:23] around the wall marching around the wall
[1:17:25] marching around the wall she hears the
[1:17:26] trumpet shout she hears that they start
[1:17:29] to shout and she hears a crumble maybe
[1:17:31] she her house maybe starts to shake a
[1:17:33] little bit and she looks out the window
[1:17:35] and she sees Susie's house go down maybe
[1:17:38] John's house goes down over here and
[1:17:40] she's thinking am I going to be another
[1:17:42] statistic just just imagine for a second
[1:17:45] she is sitting there in the midst of
[1:17:47] judgment and she's looking out am I
[1:17:50] going is my marriage going to be another
[1:17:52] statistic is my young is my teenager
[1:17:54] going to be another statistic come on
[1:17:56] now is my mental health going to be
[1:17:58] another statistic is my health in my
[1:18:01] body going to be another statistic and
[1:18:03] there's one thing she can look to the
[1:18:05] true token she can look to the true
[1:18:08] token and know that that token speaks
[1:18:10] for me in the midst of generational
[1:18:13] curses something speaks better than the
[1:18:16] evidence that is against me oh when
[1:18:19] there's a blood that speaks better
[1:18:21] things oh remember the Bible would tell
[1:18:23] us that the blood of Jesus speaks better
[1:18:25] things than that of Abel the blood of
[1:18:27] Abel would speak of condemnation and cry
[1:18:29] out against Cain but the blood of Jesus
[1:18:32] does not cry out if against you but it
[1:18:35] speaks for you that it don't matter the
[1:18:37] generational curses that has claimed you
[1:18:40] that has claimed your children that has
[1:18:42] claimed your marriage that has claimed
[1:18:44] your mind that has claimed your body
[1:18:46] there's something else that speaks for
[1:18:49] youu Hallelujah and has claimed you and
[1:18:53] is forcing it give it back you remember
[1:18:56] the brandom he would tell the story
[1:18:58] about when brother Evans had his truck
[1:19:00] stolen y'all remember that story and his
[1:19:02] truck was stolen and they got together
[1:19:04] to pray about it and as they started to
[1:19:06] pray brother the Brandon would have a
[1:19:08] vision and he would say there's a
[1:19:09] there's a man I think in a yellow shirt
[1:19:12] that was driving to Bowling Green and he
[1:19:14] would say the Holy Ghost would convict
[1:19:16] him and would condemn him for driving
[1:19:19] that truck and then he would turn that
[1:19:21] truck around and would bring it back and
[1:19:23] brother Brandon say what was it in
[1:19:25] forcing give it back see that's it
[1:19:28] that's what it's talking about restore
[1:19:31] bring it back to its original owner and
[1:19:34] if Satan has robbed you of the privilege
[1:19:37] of being a son or daughter of God we
[1:19:39] have arrived this morning by the Holy
[1:19:42] Ghost to enforce the claim of God bring
[1:19:45] it back if he's Afflicted you made you
[1:19:48] sick you have a right before God to
[1:19:51] enforce the laws of God by your stripes
[1:19:54] we are healed and amen bring it back
[1:19:56] turn him loose you're taking him out
[1:19:58] there under death but we claim him bring
[1:20:01] him back the enforcement restore it back
[1:20:04] to the Natural condition a man is sick a
[1:20:07] baby is sick a woman is sick SE they're
[1:20:09] are out of their natural condition they
[1:20:12] have a right to enforce our claim not
[1:20:14] our claim it's our claim because God has
[1:20:17] given it to us oh so generational curses
[1:20:20] are out of your natural condition when
[1:20:23] God looked before the foundation of the
[1:20:25] world you know brother Bram would talk
[1:20:27] about the woman at the whale brother
[1:20:29] Brandon would say that there whenever
[1:20:31] she would notice that I recognize Jesus
[1:20:34] it would bring her to the image that God
[1:20:36] had of her before the foundation of the
[1:20:39] world and so when go God would look at
[1:20:41] the woman at the well before the
[1:20:43] foundation of the world he didn't see a
[1:20:46] prostitute he seen someone blameless and
[1:20:48] whenever she would recognize that The
[1:20:51] Presence of Jehovah is in my midst it
[1:20:54] would bring her back to that perfected
[1:20:56] image oh Hallelujah it would restore her
[1:20:58] back to her original condition the devil
[1:21:02] would have to give her back to the claim
[1:21:04] that God would have upon her life oh
[1:21:07] when God looked at you from before the
[1:21:09] foundation of the world he didn't see a
[1:21:12] struggling marriage he didn't see
[1:21:13] rebellious teenager he seen a bride
[1:21:16] without spot and without wrinkle and he
[1:21:19] sent the spirit he sent a message and
[1:21:21] would say give it back Satan you got
[1:21:24] every claim on their life you have to
[1:21:26] let go but the Brandon would say who are
[1:21:29] you Satan who do you claim to be he
[1:21:32] would say every claim that you had was
[1:21:34] broke at Calvary so he would have a
[1:21:37] claim but when Calvary but when whenever
[1:21:40] Christ was crucified it broke the back
[1:21:43] of every claim every generational curse
[1:21:46] every marital problem that would be on
[1:21:48] your life it would break it and would
[1:21:50] say give it back it's not us claiming
[1:21:53] it's us believing in the claim the God
[1:21:55] gave us oh Hallelujah give it back but
[1:22:00] if you lift up this message above the
[1:22:02] heaviness heaviness loses its claim hope
[1:22:05] this is making sense this morning it's
[1:22:07] heaviness it's gloominess it's darkness
[1:22:09] that brings forth generational curses
[1:22:12] it's darkness that brings forth these
[1:22:14] things but if I be lifted up I would
[1:22:17] draw all men if I be lifted up wherever
[1:22:21] the carcass is there the Eagles would be
[1:22:23] gathered together Luke 24 and10 and it
[1:22:26] was Mary Magdalene and Johanna and Mary
[1:22:29] the mother of James and other women that
[1:22:31] were with him which told these things
[1:22:33] unto the apostles and their words seemed
[1:22:37] that seemed to them as Idol tales and
[1:22:40] they believe them not ain't that
[1:22:42] incredible that it was because they were
[1:22:44] so focused on the negativity that the
[1:22:48] words seem as Idol Tales oh many times
[1:22:51] that's where we get how many's ever been
[1:22:53] there before you get Battle you get warn
[1:22:55] you have problems at work you have
[1:22:57] problems at home and you come to church
[1:22:59] and the pastor gets up or an evangelist
[1:23:01] gets up and starts preaching the
[1:23:03] promises of God but they seem as Idol
[1:23:05] tales and the Bible says they believe
[1:23:07] them not and behold the 13th verse and
[1:23:10] behold two of them went the same day to
[1:23:13] a village called EMAs which was from
[1:23:15] Jerusalem about three score forong Longs
[1:23:17] and they talked about they talked
[1:23:19] together all the things which had
[1:23:21] happened they talked together about all
[1:23:24] the things which had happened and then
[1:23:26] here they come here came Jesus but they
[1:23:29] were talking about all the troubles the
[1:23:31] things all the troubles that they looked
[1:23:34] at the promises as Idol tals but what
[1:23:36] happens whenever we get troubled even
[1:23:39] though the sun has risen we start to
[1:23:41] talk about this problem I'm this
[1:23:43] preaching this morning hope it's okay we
[1:23:44] talk about this problem we talk about
[1:23:46] how this one done me wrong how that that
[1:23:48] done me wrong how this here's this way
[1:23:50] there's this way and the promises of God
[1:23:52] seemed as Idol tells if we're always
[1:23:55] dwelling on the negative we're never
[1:23:57] going to see the positive cuz brother
[1:23:59] Brandon would tell us if you want Christ
[1:24:01] to come near talk about him right talk
[1:24:04] about him so here here would come here
[1:24:07] would come Jesus and would come in the
[1:24:09] in their presence but they were so
[1:24:11] troubled that they did not recognize he
[1:24:13] remember King Bazar the Bible would say
[1:24:16] that he was troubled in Daniel 509 then
[1:24:18] was the king bazzar greatly troubled and
[1:24:21] his countenance was changed in him so
[1:24:24] the troubless of Bazar begin to change
[1:24:27] how he looked at things begin to change
[1:24:30] how he believed things and the Bible
[1:24:32] would tell brother brandom would tell us
[1:24:34] when the disciples were on the boat and
[1:24:35] the storm would come by their way
[1:24:37] brother brandom says they were having a
[1:24:39] testimony service you remember that they
[1:24:41] were having a testimony service they
[1:24:43] believed that this was God they believe
[1:24:46] that the the Miracles are taking place
[1:24:48] then there would come troubles and now
[1:24:50] they went from saying how great God is
[1:24:52] to looking at Jesus and would say do you
[1:24:54] care that we perish what would made
[1:24:56] their change what made them change the
[1:24:59] troubles and so now the troubles has
[1:25:02] causing thoughts to arise in their heart
[1:25:04] of negativity and instead of looking to
[1:25:07] the answer they look to the troubles
[1:25:09] here's the Jesus in the boat to bring a
[1:25:12] peace to bring a light to their Darkness
[1:25:15] to bring a creation of Joy but there
[1:25:17] were so focused on the troubles they
[1:25:19] failed to see who is in the boat oh in
[1:25:22] little church we get so focused upon the
[1:25:25] troubles we get so focused on the
[1:25:27] negativity we get so focused about this
[1:25:30] what what this one's saying what that
[1:25:31] one is saying here stands the answer oh
[1:25:34] Hallelujah here stands a creation of joy
[1:25:38] and and Jesus is sitting there saying
[1:25:40] just come wake me up wake me up I will
[1:25:42] bring I will bring the answer to the
[1:25:45] solution you know brother brandom says
[1:25:47] we have the answer to the to the devil's
[1:25:49] question this message is the answer but
[1:25:52] we get so focused on the problem we look
[1:25:54] to Dr doson we look to this one we look
[1:25:57] at preachers in the message what do they
[1:25:59] say about it we've got the answer we've
[1:26:01] got the creation of Joy but you notice
[1:26:04] what the what the queen belshazzar's
[1:26:07] wife would say there's a man with an
[1:26:09] excellent Spirit but has that has a that
[1:26:12] can dissolve the doubts and brother
[1:26:13] Brandon would say that what is the pro
[1:26:15] he would talk about the scripture and
[1:26:17] would say what is the prophet he says
[1:26:19] that was a proph the prophet aniel that
[1:26:21] had an excellent spirit and he says
[1:26:22] what's the prophet today the Holy Ghost
[1:26:25] right and he's here to dissolve the
[1:26:27] doubts and you see troubles changes the
[1:26:30] way we look at God the Bible would say
[1:26:32] in Luke 24:38 and he said unto them why
[1:26:35] are you troubled and why do thoughts
[1:26:37] arise in your hearts so them being
[1:26:40] troubled would cause them to look and
[1:26:42] think at the negative the Bible would
[1:26:44] say in Psalms 119 and 28 my soul melteth
[1:26:47] for heaviness but strengthen thou me
[1:26:50] according to Thy word Proverbs 12:25 he
[1:26:54] heaviness in the heart of man maketh it
[1:26:56] stoop but a good word maketh it glad and
[1:27:00] so I love how how it's given the
[1:27:01] contrast that heaviness melts the soul
[1:27:04] but strengthen me according to Thy word
[1:27:08] heaviness maketh the heart stoop but a
[1:27:10] good word maketh it glad it's letting
[1:27:13] you know that in the midst of the
[1:27:14] heaviness there is still Jesus in the
[1:27:17] ship there is still a positive word in
[1:27:20] the troubles in the he in the spirit of
[1:27:22] heaviness there is a word a Garment of
[1:27:25] Praise that you can put upon you and
[1:27:28] will bring you to into and plant you by
[1:27:31] the rivers of life and make you a tree
[1:27:33] of
[1:27:35] righteousness
[1:27:37] Hallelujah you see it's troubles
[1:27:39] heaviness brother Brandon was saying
[1:27:41] you're in the need of prayer too cuz you
[1:27:43] got a heavy heart but God knows the
[1:27:45] secret of the heart do you believe he
[1:27:48] can tell me what your heaviness is about
[1:27:51] it's because you want a baby and I see
[1:27:53] two dark sh Shadows you have two
[1:27:55] miscarriages in your time is that
[1:27:57] correct so this lady will have heaviness
[1:28:00] not because she chose to but because of
[1:28:04] hurts oh man I've been hurt before I've
[1:28:07] been bitter before it's Heaven things
[1:28:09] you can't control but you can control
[1:28:12] how the heaviness affects you so here
[1:28:14] stands this lady in the in front of the
[1:28:17] prophet and brother brandham starts to
[1:28:18] discern her life and and we look past
[1:28:20] the heaviness we look past it and when
[1:28:23] when go to the root of the problem and
[1:28:26] would say you were hurt you had two
[1:28:28] miscarriages now there's two Shadows
[1:28:30] hanging over you oh and I believe we had
[1:28:32] a word that can look to is still
[1:28:34] Discerning the hearts that can go to the
[1:28:36] root of the problem and say you don't
[1:28:38] got to be bitter you don't got to be
[1:28:40] broken you may have had natural
[1:28:42] circumstances that bring this upon you
[1:28:45] but I'm looking through it and see that
[1:28:47] there's Shadows that can be taken away
[1:28:49] by the light you can look at Martha and
[1:28:51] Mary the Bible would say in Luke 10 41
[1:28:55] and Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:28:56] Martha Martha thou W careful and
[1:28:58] troubled about many things and this is
[1:29:02] really stood out to me because here is
[1:29:04] Martha that is troubled right and you
[1:29:06] would think the one that can help her
[1:29:08] troubles is standing right in front of
[1:29:10] her here is Jesus in her very house and
[1:29:14] here if anybody could help her troubles
[1:29:16] it was Jesus but what did she do with
[1:29:19] her opportunity now this really spoke to
[1:29:21] my heart what did she do with her
[1:29:23] opportunity
[1:29:24] instead of looking to Jesus and saying
[1:29:26] hey help my troubles she says have you
[1:29:28] seen Mary so here she stood in the in
[1:29:31] the presence of the solution oh man we
[1:29:34] do that many times sit in church oh hope
[1:29:36] so and so's listening I hope so and so
[1:29:38] oh that one needs to hear it and IR
[1:29:40] understanding the solution to the
[1:29:42] troubles if you would just talk to me if
[1:29:45] you would just listen to what I got to
[1:29:47] send Jesus will look to Martha and would
[1:29:50] say but Mary has chosen the good thing
[1:29:52] that would not depart from her right oh
[1:29:55] she chose the good thing she did not
[1:29:57] waste her opportunity to complain about
[1:30:00] her troubles oh Hallelujah there's a
[1:30:04] difference in asking for help in the
[1:30:06] troubles and complaining about the
[1:30:07] troubles because if you're complaining
[1:30:09] about the troubles you're never going to
[1:30:10] listen right hope this is okay you know
[1:30:13] many many men always say that whenever
[1:30:15] the wife comes and starts to complaining
[1:30:18] she don't want you to answer she wants
[1:30:19] you to listen right how many's ever
[1:30:21] heard that before and that's the way we
[1:30:23] come to God complaining God's trying to
[1:30:26] help you but you're not listening oh I'm
[1:30:28] preaching now if you're complaining
[1:30:30] about the troubles complaining about
[1:30:32] this one complaining here is the
[1:30:34] solution but all we can think about is
[1:30:36] that one all we can think about is this
[1:30:38] one but Mary chose the right thing she
[1:30:41] wasn't complaining she was sitting at
[1:30:43] the feet of Jesus not wasting her
[1:30:45] opportunity and I see little church
[1:30:47] don't waste her opportunity if it's a
[1:30:49] Wednesday night a Sunday morning a
[1:30:51] Sunday night it's the solution it's the
[1:30:54] light to bring forth a creation of joy
[1:30:57] in the midst of all of the
[1:30:59] troubles but one thing is needful the
[1:31:01] 42nd verse one thing is needful and Mary
[1:31:04] chosen the good part which shall not be
[1:31:06] taken away from her oh man I said Lord
[1:31:09] don't let me cause troubles to miss out
[1:31:11] on your visitation so here are the two
[1:31:14] on the way to Emmas and instead of
[1:31:16] talking about the beauty of the hour
[1:31:18] they were talking about the Troubles of
[1:31:20] the hour and I love this and Luke 24:15
[1:31:24] and it came to pass that when they
[1:31:25] communed together and reason Jesus
[1:31:28] himself Drew near and went with him
[1:31:32] Jesus himself and but their eyes were
[1:31:35] holding that they should not know him
[1:31:37] and he said unto them what manner of
[1:31:40] communications are these that you have
[1:31:42] one to another as you walk and are sad
[1:31:46] so their Communications was bringing a
[1:31:48] heaviness on oh Hallelujah their
[1:31:51] Communications them talking about the
[1:31:54] troubles now were making their heart sad
[1:31:56] and they were so sad and so caught up in
[1:31:59] the troubles that Jesus himself the Lord
[1:32:03] himself shall descend the mighty Angels
[1:32:05] come down with an open book but they
[1:32:07] were so troubled that here came Jesus
[1:32:10] and the Bible would tell us that they
[1:32:12] when Jesus asked what are you talking
[1:32:13] about they say are you a stranger in
[1:32:15] these parts the troubles had got them so
[1:32:18] wrapped up in heaviness that Jesus
[1:32:20] himself was a stranger oh don't let
[1:32:23] Jesus Jus be a stranger whenever I'm in
[1:32:25] the boat in the stormy weather let him
[1:32:27] not be a stranger but let me recognize
[1:32:30] him the conversations they were having
[1:32:32] LED them in a in a condition of
[1:32:35] heaviness but Jesus didn't leave him
[1:32:37] there but he started the Bible will tell
[1:32:38] us that he he he he started there with
[1:32:41] Moses's teaching and went through all of
[1:32:43] through the scriptures and the Scrolls
[1:32:45] preaching concerning himself and the
[1:32:48] Bible would say as he broke the bread
[1:32:50] their eyes was open in Luke 24 and3 and
[1:32:53] it came to pass as he set a meat with
[1:32:56] them he took bread and blessed it and
[1:32:58] break it and gave it to them and their
[1:33:01] eyes were open and they knew him so
[1:33:04] while they were in the heaviness they
[1:33:06] did not know him but once the bread was
[1:33:09] broke oh what was the bread what is the
[1:33:11] bread that Jesus would say I am the
[1:33:13] bread of life I am the living bread the
[1:33:16] Bible would say in 1 Thessalonians 4:16
[1:33:18] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:33:20] heaven with a shout for the brand must
[1:33:23] say what the shout it's a message what
[1:33:26] is the message it's the living bread the
[1:33:28] open book it was Jesus himself coming
[1:33:32] with a broken bread letting you know you
[1:33:34] can know me even in the troubles even in
[1:33:37] the heaviness here is your eyes can be
[1:33:40] open that you can know me the Bible
[1:33:42] would say in John 6:35 and Jesus said
[1:33:45] unto them I am the bread of life he that
[1:33:47] cometh to me shall never hunger and he
[1:33:50] that believeth on me shall never thirst
[1:33:52] but I said unto to you that ye have also
[1:33:55] seen me and believe not brother brand
[1:33:58] will say and a shout what is the shout
[1:34:00] it's the message going forth first the
[1:34:02] living bread of life bringing forth a
[1:34:04] bride oh it's the living bread coming
[1:34:08] and says hey you can know me and what is
[1:34:10] this message doing saying you can know
[1:34:12] me brother Brandon would tell us that a
[1:34:14] prophet was to come and reveal the
[1:34:16] Mysteries which is the living bread and
[1:34:18] you see I'm so glad that that here Jesus
[1:34:22] would not leave these two in their fog
[1:34:24] just give me a few more minutes and I'll
[1:34:26] bring this down to a close but you see
[1:34:28] here was Jesus walking with him but he
[1:34:31] was not willing to leave them in this
[1:34:32] fog leave them in this confusion leave
[1:34:35] them in the state of not knowing who he
[1:34:37] was but he was willing to break the
[1:34:39] bread he was willing to let them know
[1:34:41] that the sun is up you know and I'm so
[1:34:44] glad that God wasn't willing to leave us
[1:34:46] there leave us in our confusion leave us
[1:34:48] in our heaviness leave us in our state
[1:34:51] where we could not recognize him you
[1:34:52] know brother the BR would talk about
[1:34:54] whenever he was fishing there on the
[1:34:55] east coast and he would say that him and
[1:34:58] brother Ed Bisal would hire a guide and
[1:35:00] would take them out fishing but there
[1:35:02] was a young man that was with them that
[1:35:04] was young and didn't know the didn't
[1:35:05] know the ropes and things and brother
[1:35:07] brandham says they started the drift off
[1:35:09] and it was dark and foggy he says if
[1:35:11] you've ever been there you would know
[1:35:12] it's foggy it's dark and he says and
[1:35:14] this young man started to panic and
[1:35:16] would say oh we're drifting away from
[1:35:18] the shore we're drifting out the sea and
[1:35:21] brother brandham says the old man would
[1:35:23] stop and say calm down just wait till
[1:35:26] the sun comes up then you will know
[1:35:28] where you are at and brother Brandon
[1:35:30] would say just wait till the sun comes
[1:35:32] up and we will see where we are at he is
[1:35:35] the word so here was this young boy
[1:35:37] sitting in the fog of confusion but
[1:35:40] there was an old veteran that would say
[1:35:42] just wait quit panicking you might not
[1:35:44] understand how you're going to get back
[1:35:45] to the shore you might not understand
[1:35:48] how you're going to make her through
[1:35:49] this trouble but the sun is coming up
[1:35:52] once you can see the sun he will let you
[1:35:54] know where you are at oh don't give up
[1:35:57] in the hard times the Sun is up the Sun
[1:36:00] is up shining through the clouds shining
[1:36:03] through the fog you know brother Brandon
[1:36:05] would would talk about a jocked whenever
[1:36:07] she put Moses in the Nile River but the
[1:36:10] brandom says she would look up and look
[1:36:12] through the clouds to a god that was
[1:36:15] caring for him so even though the sun
[1:36:17] could not be seen because of the clouds
[1:36:20] she knew that he was there and maybe you
[1:36:22] can't see this promised word because of
[1:36:25] the clouds but it is still there the sun
[1:36:28] is still shining to bring forth the
[1:36:30] creation of joy you know brother Brandon
[1:36:32] would talk about we talk about the the
[1:36:34] rainbow and would say God gave that
[1:36:36] promise thousands of years ago but God
[1:36:38] still Honors that promise and when does
[1:36:40] the rainbow appear whenever it's dark
[1:36:43] whenever there's clouds whenever it's
[1:36:44] been raining and thundering and
[1:36:46] lightning it's after the storm is when
[1:36:48] the rainbow appears and says I have not
[1:36:51] forgotten my promise oh when it's
[1:36:53] whenever you're at the darkest time that
[1:36:55] God let you know I have not forgot my
[1:36:57] promise you remember the story by the
[1:36:59] Brandon Matel about the sand the
[1:37:01] footprints on the sands of time y'all
[1:37:03] remember that and the man was
[1:37:04] complaining saying why did you leave me
[1:37:06] there and God would say I didn't leave
[1:37:08] you there what do you mean he would say
[1:37:10] look there's two sets of footprints but
[1:37:12] right over here there's only one set and
[1:37:14] God would say that's when I picked you
[1:37:16] up and carried you it was at the darkest
[1:37:19] time at the weakest hour is when God
[1:37:21] would come and pick him up oh when it's
[1:37:24] a true weakest moment then the then the
[1:37:26] judgments you feel upon the Earth where
[1:37:28] you feel like you're losing your mind
[1:37:30] you feel like everything's going to fall
[1:37:32] apart that you can look through the fog
[1:37:34] and say I know my redeemer liveth and at
[1:37:37] that day I will see my God in this flesh
[1:37:40] I'm going to see it even though this
[1:37:42] flesh is battered it's beaten it's worn
[1:37:44] I've got a promise oh Hallelujah weeping
[1:37:48] may endure for a night but joy cometh in
[1:37:51] the morning weeping may heaviness may
[1:37:53] end door but once the sun rises up it's
[1:37:56] going to bring something it's going to
[1:37:57] bring a joy you see but we had a word
[1:38:00] that brother Brandon would say he would
[1:38:02] say this here you're a Believer your
[1:38:04] spirit is welcome he see I know that you
[1:38:07] are a Believer and you're aware that
[1:38:09] something is going on now that's what
[1:38:11] you see on that picture now the audience
[1:38:13] might know sir just the last few seconds
[1:38:16] something has been moving on you is that
[1:38:18] right raise up your hand see it's just
[1:38:20] settling down between you and I it
[1:38:23] becomes like a fog and I'm looking
[1:38:25] through it and I keep seeing somebody
[1:38:27] else cuz it's somebody you're here for
[1:38:30] it's a man and the man is a relative of
[1:38:32] yours and he has lung trouble he's not

[1:38:38] relative of yours in so much that that
[1:38:41] there's a that he's a brother-in-law to

[1:39:02] spirit is welcome so this man was not a
[1:39:05] sinner he didn't lose the Holy Ghost he
[1:39:07] wasn't a backslider but he was just he
[1:39:09] was in a heaviness and then here a
[1:39:12] prophet would look through that fog and
