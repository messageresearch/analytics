this old course in half sister Loretta there's never been a day oh there's never been a day like this day to me and there's never been a day like this day I see oh and there's never been a lights all that shines so bright as this day this glorious day [Music] let's think that that pork rice is revealing himself is he this morning again open my eyes can see oh his word is becoming a reality of this

a day foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen do you believe what you were singing there's never been a day like this day the Mysteries have been opened we see Who We Are we see the tricks and the tactics of the devil that should place the courage on the inside amen you happen to be in the house of the Lord amen it's good to see our visitors hope you all feel welcome this morning if you have your Bibles I've got two places uh in the scripture that I want to read the first one is Isaiah 53 and 1. we'll just read one verse there in Matthew 11 and 25. amen it's good to be a Christian amen I've been watching the services there in Hardy that our pastor and brother Andrew Glover and Daryl Ward is but Daryl's been preaching and they've been some outstanding services so we thank the Lord for that amen it's always it's always encouraging to see how God ain't just moving in one place but he's moving Nationwide worldwide wherever the message is being preached God is moving okay man I believe that with all my heart Isaiah 53 and 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed then Matthew 11 and 25. brother Branham would say if you believe the report then the arm of the Lord is revealed so the strength or the power of the Lord the the hand of the Lord is always operated by faith it's operated by somebody believing it Matthew 11 and 25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee your father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight give me about our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord that you've given us father placing a desire on the inside Lord draw and guess Lord to your house we ask God that you would move in a special way this morning you see the needs of the people father I ask that you would move me your word go to the need father may you bring healing Deliverance whatever it may be Lord we commit the service into your hands in Jesus name amen you may be seated and I just have a a simple thought this morning it would be the the right approach and I've been going through God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself the same and it's a lot of what I'm going to be preaching this morning is going to be out of that that message and if you haven't heard it in a while or have never listened to it before it's a it's a good message to listen to but brother Branham says catch those two scriptures who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed then Jesus thanked God that he hid the mysteries from the wise and prudent and revealed it to babes such as we'll learn for it seemed good to God to do that so God hid the mysteries from the wise and The Prudent and revealed them unto babes that were willing to learn so not everybody is going to see the arm of the Lord but it's the ones that are willing to learn to embrace the report and put it into action so that the arm of the Lord can be revealed so first you have to be really willing to be taught God you got to be willing to learn you got to be willing to say I don't know what all teach me you see you know somebody knows it all you know like electricity a lot of us are are some are Germans and contractors apprentices and if you already know it all the journeyman's not going to be able to teach you anything or the contractor ain't going to be able to teach you anything but if you're willing to learn you can experience the true power of electricity you can experience and you can know for yourself not with the head knowledge but once you're willing to learn then you can experience the true power of it in my that's the way it is with the scriptures with the message if you're willing to be taught if you're willing to learn if you're willing to say teach me then the arm of the Lord can be expressed not only to the preacher but it can be expressed to a teenager to a mama to a daddy to a to a young boy young girl but first you got to be willing to learn and say teach me teach me the strength of the Lord you see brother Branham says then when when we come sounds uh sanely sound to God when we come without malice any Prejudice and with an open heart willing to learn God's able to teach when we're willing to learn but first we have to lay us our Traditions lay aside our ideas what we've been taught now I know mother taught these taught you these things that was very good and so forth but sometimes mothers had things wrong and so I've given the example before but you can't go to a zero turn mower and try pushing it it's not meant to be operated that way you can't go to a push mower and try riding on it even though you got good intentions you're sincere you think that you're right but you're not going to go anywhere until it's operated like it's meant to be operated and once you sit on the Zero Turn instead of trying to push it then the power of that zero turn is starting to manifest itself then you're moving somewhere now you're cutting grass you're experiencing the true potential and all my Once We Lay tied what we think is right well our what our ideas are and embrace the true power of this message then once you go into action once you overcome things that you never could overcome once you push past ideas and traditions that you never could get past the first that starts with willing to be taught willing to say I don't know it all teach me something but you see like I said a few minutes earlier saying the arm of the Lord comes down to believing the report and brother Branham says it's a question then he's answering the question who who I believe the report and who is the arm of the Lord being revealed to and you see you can't experience the power of God unless you first believe it and operate it you look at John 11 and 25 Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me the hero dead yet he shall live and whatsoever whosoever liveth and believe believeth in me never shall die then he asked the question believeth thou this so he's saying hear the same word the spoke light in the beginning the same word the spoken Earth into existence the same word the prop this body out of the Tomb is the same word that can bring everybody out of the Tomb the container I take a generation and they can escape the the Griffin of the grip of death but believeth thou this so before you can operate the power of the Resurrection you've got to believe it before it can work for your life through your body you first have got to believe it and this is talking about Lazarus it was Martha that had the right approach brother Branham says she had a right to be mad at Jesus because he didn't come when she called for him but hurry her approach was that of Faith she said even now Lord if you speak the word I know my brother he will come out of that tomb it didn't matter the situations Hallelujah it didn't matter how tough death was how tough the grave was there was somebody that was operating the word like it was meant to be operated and I don't care how toughly going to see it is the spirits of laodicea is taking out this member taking up that member but there's a bride on Earth that's approaching the word Now with an idea not with a sensation but they're taking the word with faith the right approach and they're defeating every Spirit they're defeating every Spirit of lukewarmness and lay on a spirit of formalism there's a blind that is a marching step because they've got the right approach I am the resurrection and the life if you will believe on me he the same things that I am doing he will do and I could imagine that Jesus could have looked into the future and seen Jesus body coming out of the Tomb and from my and here I'm going to let Lazarus experience the same thing that I'm going to experience come on somebody it ain't just Jesus that's gonna rise out of the Grave or that rose out of the grave but Lazarus was experiencing the same power oh Hallelujah and it's not just the prophet that could speak the word and speak Miracles into existence it's not just Jesus that can curse the Fig Tree and there's a bride that is operating the word of God for this generation and have got the same manifestations of the spoken word Jesus said if you say unto this mountain and doubt not but you believe it it will happen as if I like that you say it it ain't just for me but it's for somebody that's got the right approach as for somebody that's got the right approach it ain't coming with their own ideas it's coming with faith believe us now this so you're you're your approach has first got to be right before you could operate what God has for this generation you remember brother Branham talks about the man he says I don't care if ten thousand Miracles I still don't believe in Divine Healing and brother Branham says sure it's not for unbelievers it's only for believers so in other words you can say that all you want it's not going to discourage me because there is somebody that is believing it that is approaching it the right away and miracles are still taking place and I can say that for this generation let them turn away from this message and say it's false and say that this was a false prophet but fear is still somebody that is experiencing the true power of this a message there's a victorious in life inside of a young person that's not being defiled by Lush not being defiled but pornography not being empowered by drinking marriages or being held together there's a group on earth that is experiencing the harm of the Lord because they are approaching it the right way you see Europe coach goes back to your expectation you see brother Branham says this uh now usually you get what you're expecting if you come to a meeting tonight to criticize or to make fun or to stir something up the devil will give you something to criticize he will give you something to arouse your curiosity and you just get what you're expecting if you come tonight expecting to see the Lord in this work and God will show himself and give you such a peace if you just come tonight expect you to be healed you will be healed you will get what you expect so he is saying if you come to a meeting even though the Supernatural is taking place healings can be taken place the arm of the Lord is revealing itself but if your expectation is that to criticize that all you're going to see but if your expectation is I'm going to see the arm of the Lord personally to me then that expectation will be fulfilled you know brother Branham says that the the the woman with the issue of blood expected to get her healing whenever she touched the garments of Jesus something of Simplicity she didn't even touch his leg or his foot she just touched the Garment just a little bit of that but that expectation brought the strength of the Lord down personal to her you might not know all the quotes you might not know all the scriptures but if you can just approach it in the Simplicity of Faith watch the arm of the Lord come in Mighty in battle and heal your body take that cancer away take that asthma away bring your loved ones back to the back to the Lord and fill them with the Holy Ghost it's up to your approach but it goes back to your expectation what are you expecting when you come to church is your expectation just well we're going to hear another sermon or where's your expectation I'm going to see God for me I'm going to see the Holy Ghost fall in my life I'm going to see healing take place in my home I don't care if this one's get touched if that one gets touched my expectation is for me to see the arm of the Lord Brother Branham says and you only get from God the things that you're expecting from God in the way you approach God you approach him with reverence with faith and every word is true so he's saying here you're expecting from God and the way you approach him so the way you approach him determines what your expectation is come on now your expectation is going to push the way you approach God so when you come to church and you're not expecting anything that's the way your approach is going to be but if there's somebody expecting to see God move them the approach changes I'm no longer just coming out of Duty but I'm expecting this to see the arm of the Lord to me then your approach changes saying God I'm coming to mean business I'm coming to get something from you your approach has changed and that's the way it is with the message of the hour if you're listening to the tapes and reading the books just to find something to criticize your expectation is going to push that approach and you're never going to you're never going to experience it but if your expectation goes from that so Lord speak to me teach me show me your ways show me your arm show me your power then by the expectation pushes that approach so I'm not finding something to criticize I'm finding the saith the Lord I'm finding the word the report for this state you see your approach goes back to your expectation but the Bible tells us how to approach him in Hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so he's saying here you can't come to God saying I don't know if you're real you can't come to God saying I don't know if you can heal you can't come to God same cause the days of Miracles past you're never going to experience the arm of the Lord that way but if your approach changes to that of Faith saying Lord I know you're the same yesterday today and forever I know you're still filled with the Holy Ghost I know you still heal of cancer and then watch the arm of the Lord start to come down in a personal way you see faith is more than just saying I believe God it's more than just saying I'm a Christian because if it's just lip service then whenever doubt comes your faith is shaken you look at Matthew 15 and 8. this people drove of Nag unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me you don't believe from your mind you believe from the soul you believe from the heart that's been transformed because when mind battles is going to attack the mind and your mind may get weary your mind may get weak but the soul that has been transformed will never get weary you can never burn out Faith you can never push out Faith whenever struggles and temptations comes that faith is always going to remain that's where we're believing from that's what we're approaching from is the soul that's been filled with the Holy Ghost there's no cancer that can burn out your faith Hallelujah there's no struggles there's nothing that can burn out the faith the approach of God Hallelujah I don't know where you're at this morning but if there's somebody that is needing healing in their body approach god with faith and say by your stripes I'm Healed you're the same yesterday today and forever my case may look impossible but I'm approaching the god of the possibility the Bible says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so it's moved from just saying I believe God through there being a reality of I believe God you see faith is there is an anchor it's something that connects you with God but the Branham says many people replace Faith with hope I hope God can do this I hope God can do that I hope God can save me but there's no reality with hope there's no Assurance with hope but faith is an anchor it's a reality it's something that you can't see with a natural eye but faith is the substance of that's right about what you're believing for but you notice how the Bible says that faith is the substance of things hoped for so no longer is it something you're wishing and you're not hoping for it now there's a substance of something that you hope for there's now a substance of something you was wishing that you had now there's a reality that the arm of the Lord is now revealing itself in my life we're not hoping that we're going to make a Rapture but faith says nothing can keep me out of the Rapture we're not hoping that we're going to get a body change faith says nothing is going to keep me from getting my body changed hope says I hope there's a future home but faith says there's a future home that is on the other side of this Dimension Heaven Ain't a million miles away it's in another dimension that's what faith says faith says devil you better back up you better get out of my way I'm somebody let's approached God the right way in the arm of the Lord is being revealed it's showing its power through my life and every Temptation in every trial in every Circumstance the arm of the Lord is revealing itself so it's gone from a mythical hope a mythical heart to a reality but the Branham says it's absolutely substance it's absolutely material it's something that you can grab a hold of and say this is mine so it goes beyond what you see what you understand to a direct evidence of things you don't seem so faith is the key that unlocks the supernatural it opens the door you see if we didn't have a key like I think it was like three Sundays ago four Sundays ago whenever Dad was in Canada I come here all the doors were locked I couldn't get into the office I was supposed to preach that morning I didn't have a key to open the seal so everything that was behind that door was a mysterious it was something in a mysterious way I could guess what was behind that door but I didn't know with the Revelation what was behind that door I couldn't experience the power that was behind that door but then brother William come with the King that key unlocked the door and loose the seal where I could walk into the revelation of what was behind that door so now I'm no longer dashing what is behind that door but the key open the shell so that I could see and experience oh come on now you see we had a prophet in this day that come with the message and opened up the seals but without faith it's still going to be a sealed book it's going to remain in a mysterious way but Faith opens the door so that you can see what the prophet revealed in this generation well we're no longer guessing what is taking place but Faith takes what a prophet brought and brings it into reality oh come on somebody Faith makes this message alive Faith brings this message into reality it's more than tapes and books it's more than MP3s it's more than sermons it's a reality faith has brought the supernatural that this message has brought and put it into reality Hallelujah there's a power inside of this message that is keeping families together it's keeping young people out of pornography there's a power the arm of the Lord is expressing itself through a generation I believe her this morning somebody is expressing the strength of the Lord but faith is the key that unlocks the mysteries for this day it's the arm of the Lord that is now being expressed there's direct evidence of the arm of the Lord you see where faith is and doubt has no grounds whenever like I talked about the light wherever light is Darkness has to flee whenever there's Faith doubt has to leave so whenever the key of Faith opens the door there's no room for doubt because you can see what is there you know I if I never opened this door I could guess that there was a that there was an office chair there I could guess that there was a desk there because I didn't know I've never been in there before and so now there's doubts that I might not have a place to sit there's doubts that I might not have a desk to put my computer on there's doubts because I can't see what's behind that door but once I open the door all of the doubts vanish because I can see with my eye that there's a desk there I can see with my eye that there's a chair there doubt has no more room there because there's the key that opened my eyes and once you have faith can see what the prophet brought there's no room for doubt because you can see that there's a bride with the spot and wrinkle you can see it so there's no room for it out you see brother Branham says this and now we found salvation that will save us from sin though take the virus women or men drunk prostitute and make them a child of God well that same Faith the same power that will lift up a fallen man or a woman with that excuse me it'll work for us in many different ways it will heal our bodies if you can just find the right approach you've got to find how to do it so be saying here the same approach of faith that you used to be saved is the same approach of faith that you have to have to be healed the approach to God never changes you don't come to God with faith and become saved and then whenever you want to get the Holy Ghost the approach changes it's the same approach in every stage of the journey if you're in justification you have to have the approach of faith if it's sanctification you have to have the approach of faith if it's the Holy Ghost you have to have the approach of faith and here we are at the opening of the word it's the same approach that you needed for justification for sanctification for the Holy Ghost is the same approach that you have to have concerning the word for this generation not any approach is going to bring a revelation it's only the approach of Faith what do you mean by the approach of Faith it's coming up to it with no doubt no reasoning but only Faith saying whatever you speak to me Lord I'm going to believe it like whenever you go and read the Bible there's going to be atheists ideas there's going to be the Big Bang Theory there's going to be all of these other theories but whenever you come and read the Bible you push all of those theories away and approach it with faith saying whatever this says if a contradicts The Big Bang Theory my faith is right here if it contradicts what the atheists say my approach to Faith is ranked here and that's the way it is with the word that's been given in this generation all other ideas have got to go whenever you approach it with faith it may contradict what this one says it may contradict what mama says it may contradict what grandpa says but I'm approaching the word for this day with faith now we're skeptical now with Skeptics not with ideas of this one or that one but I'm approaching it with the faith saying Lord this is for me but you see me where many people fall is this hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes but the Branham says it's coming in a simple way that the wise Overlook it that's coming in a way the third now willing to learn from simplicity it's true Dylan if you knew something that Miguel didn't know he's going to have a hard time listening to you just because he's somebody he's been Apprentice he's been a tournament he's been a contractor and here you are you don't even got your Apprentice card yet and so why would he listen to somebody that is so simple come on now and that's that that's the thinking of the generation is I've been to college I've been to Seminary I've been here I've been there and this is somebody that didn't even finish high school he's down going to college he didn't go to Bible school but it was a Simplicity the God was revealing him through and but if there's somebody that is willing to learn saying the Lord teach me teach me your ways show me your arm show me your power I'm going to believe the report of the Lord it may be hid from the wise it may be hid from The Prudent but I'm somebody that is willing to learn oh my brother Branham tells the story of Mr Dorsey he was an old man around 85 years old he said he was in the Civil War he has seen a lot of things he has seen the world changed in a lot of ways and he says there was a little girl that was heading to Sunday school and this man stopped and he says little girl where are you going and then she says sir I'm going to Sunday school and he says don't you know that's a waste of time he said she said no sir it's not she says how do you know that God is real and brother Brandon says she stopped have picked up a little flower and says Mr Darcy where did this flower come from where did it come from where did the seed come from where did the Earth come from and brother Branham says it was through Simplicity that that man gave us heart to Christ because it was through the Simplicity of a little girl if a little girl can explain God then the wisest of the man should turn around and say give me what you got and that's what this message has done it's coming simplicity so the children can understand that somebody that never graduated can understand somebody that was never able to read can understand it come in simplicity so that no matter where you're at in life you can understand the arm of the Lord it's come in Simplicity where we can see it but the Branham says it's crazy to think that how he hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in Simplicity where the wise can't even see it but he says God makes himself so simple so nobody can miss it he refers back to the scripture in Isaiah 35 and 8 and the highway shall be there in a way it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the way fearing man the fools should not error therein he says it's made so simple that even the fools can understand him but the wise are not able to go over it oh my the brother Branham says whenever God is going to deliver he comes with the message he sends a message to the people that is so simple that the wise don't see it oh this is okay this evening I've been going through this and it's been it's been coming real to me but he says that you can look at Moses his family his his dad you don't even know of he was a son from Levi but you don't even know nothing else his mom was just an ordinary slave a mud dauber that was making bricks for the Egyptians but God called called A simple family to bring forth the deliverer for that generation and he says he had to keep Moses simple he says he allowed Moses to go into Pharaoh's house and get an education he says he was a ruler he conquered Nations around him he was a general but he needed Moses to topple so that he could know but only through Simplicity will Deliverance take place and he says what happened he got one dead Egyptian that's what his education got was one dead Egyptian but he allowed him to Tumble and go into the desert so all of that education could be bitten out of him so that he could come with Simplicity because that's the way that Deliverance was going to take place was through Simplicity and what happened it was Simplicity the Bright Lights Out of Heaven it was Simplicity the the frogs it was Simplicity that turned the water in the blood it was Simplicity that split the Red Sea it was Simplicity the prop Manor Out of Heaven it was Simplicity the brought water out of a rock and it's been Simplicity that squirrels were spoken into existence it was through Simplicity the Hattie rights thought our loved ones to be saved and it's through Simplicity that there's a pride with our spots and without wrinkle is through Simplicity the sure going to make a rapture you might not understand that but it's so simple that you can't help but believe it it's coming such a simple way that the heavens declared it there were seven angels that went up into the heavens the the pillar of fire come down in Houston and in this picture taken with him there was another pictures that were taken of the pillar of fire it's common such a simple way that you can't help but believe it if you're willing to learn see that's what it comes down to is what is your approach to this word going to be come on now what is your approach to this word going to be brother Branham says when he couldn't do it by military training or by an education by scientific education or by a military force he could not do it he gave him an old cricket stick off of the desert and he did it with that God in humility Simplicity God was in that stick and then Moses and as long as Moses had the stick have the Simplicity then God had it because God was with Moses as long as Moses stayed with the Simplicity of that message God was with him oh come on now we got too many people that are trying to make this message so complicated and so profound and so big it's really not that big it's simple men make it confusing but the prophet brought a simple message oh come on now you see this message ain't to bring you into confusion is to bring you out it's not to take you back it was a Moses message that was having the people go around the Wilderness for 20 years it was a Moses message Moses message was through Joshua and Caleb going into the promised land you see it was a Moses it was the men inside of that message I'm preaching now that was causing confusion and that caused them to go in the wilderness for 20 years but there was a Joshua and Caleb that says my Approach is only to this message by faith I don't care what the distance in the chorus are saying this is a message that's coming Simplicity let us Call My Name give me my Mountain give me my inheritance paintable saying I might be 85 years old but I don't care the Simplicity of this message told me it's mine my inheritance is mine I'm willing to fight for it let me this morning are you willing to fight for it are you willing to remain in Simplicity and say give me my Mountain give me my inheritance give me my healing give me the Holy Ghost give me my loved ones give me my family yes as for me and my house I'm going to serve the Lord give me my mountain you look at Caleb Caleb's response was the same as Moses you know what I said what did Moses say I want to go tell Moses I have come down to deliver them to bring them out of that land into a good land flowing with milk and honey and what was Caleb saying whenever they was on the border of the inheritance he says he has given us this land flowing with the milk and honey his reports did not change from Moses's report come on now his report was the same as the message I'm preaching now and what happened he got the same results that the message promised come on now if he would just stay with that message the prophecy the message prompt which starts upon the past and if you can just stay with this message the Simplicity of it you will see the prophecy of a Rapture come the past you will see the prophecy of the future home come to pass oh Hallelujah Joshua and Caleb look crazy but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord we're going to serve the Lord we're following this message it was the wise men who seen the star there was no bodies but they was willing to follow it there was rulings they recognized the business scripture coming to pass you look at numbers 24 and 17 and I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not nigh there shall come a star out of Jacob by the praying them says whenever they seen the star they referred back to numbers he says one of them stop and he says go get the Scrolls go get the Scrolls what does the scroll say about a star and whenever they looked at the scroll a revelation took place and when the praying them says they left the fire that they was around and ran into the tower they didn't need the man-made light anymore there was a star a scriptural prophecy that was now shining the light and you look what the Bible says in Matthew 2 and 10 when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy because they knew that all the astrologers wasn't looking up the skies all of the smart men was looking out the skies but they don't see what I see they don't understand what I see they should be following there should be astrologers everywhere following this star but they could not say it but these three men started to Rejoice saying we see the star we see the light this ain't just something happening by chance but this is a scripture light that is the leading us how come they follow the star there is a revelation knowing if there's a star there's got to be a scripture anointed one on the earth that this is a leading us too and once the Bible say they follow the star they said we sing the star in the east I believe and they followed it and they come into the City and the Bible says that they started to make started to demand where is he that is born King of the Jews will fall on the star show me the arm of the Lord show me the strength of the Lord show me the power of his resurrection we're not following as if I Stables we're not falling something in our imagination show us the power of the Lord and they did not stop until they wrapped the feet of Jesus the arm of the Lord they now could see him oh what's the bible say that there was to be a star in each of the church ages what is that star it's an angel It's a messenger that was to bring the message bring an interpretation show to you the arm of the Lord that's what we're following is the light oh you notice how the Bible says though whenever the wise man they come to the city in Matthew 2 and 1 and now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there come wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star and we have seen history not a star but we have seen his star the king of the Jews the one we're looking for we have found this star and let me say this we have found the star the the messenger for laodicea we have found the star he has led us to Jesus Christ he has allowed us to the strength of the Lord Hallelujah he's allowed us to it that's why they couldn't be they couldn't help but rejoice when they're seen his star because they knew that there's something on Earth taking place there's a supernatural taking place in what is Matthew 13 and 16 say blessed are your eyes for they seem and your ears for they hear something is taking place in this generation that we're recognizing the star we're recognizing that this ain't something by accident but there's a fullness taken place you see brother Branham said the wise men of today will not follow crage they will not follow dogmas but will follow the god-given spoken word till they see the fullness of the power and that's what the wise men were looking show us the king what is the king one with power one with authority we've seen a star but show us the King and I will say that's our attitude today we have seen a star we have found the message we've seen the anointing but show us the king I want to see the Lord Mighty in battle not for the preacher but for me I want to see the arm of the Lord Heal My Body I want to say the arm of the Lord fill my daughter with the Holy Ghost show us the king show us the one with authority show us the one with power we have seen his star show us the fullness of the power of God show us it but you notice how the Bible calls them wise men but you go back to Jesus Jesus says that the wise and The Prudent no no the Mysteries but at the same time the Bible calls these ones what and I thought my then I started searching it out you look at James 3 and 14 but ye have bitter envying Strife in your hearts Glory not to lie not against the truth this wisdom this sendeth not from above but is Earthly Central devilish for we're envying Strife is there was confusion in every evil work so the wisdom that is of the earth brings confusion but to come down to the next verse but the wisdom that is from above is first core and then Peaceable gentle easy to being treated full of Mercy good fruits and he says without hypocrisy and so there's one wisdom that is of the earth that is bringing bringing a confusion but at the same time there's a Heavenly wisdom that is coming down to earth and it's bringing us security so the approach of worldly wisdom is what wrong and so the wise is a missing the Mysteries because of their wisdom but to the bride because of the Mysteries there's a wisdom that has been given to this generation we're not walking around in confusion but there's been a wisdom that has been given in this day you see brother Branham says that and so the wisdom that I want to get I want to get straightened out before we start there was a wisdom of God a wisdom of God is to stay with the word but Satan in his wisdom trying to twist the word so that's the wisdom I'm speaking of he's talking about wisdom versus faith and we see what happened at the fall in the beginning it was because of the Simplicity of God's orders you know God only said a couple things he says you can eat of this fruit or eat of this tree all the trees in the garden it but this one you cannot partake of it was a simple demand or simple command but it was through the wisdom of the serpent that she did away with the Simplicity you look at Genesis 3 and 5 for God does know in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as God knowing good and evil you notice where did the serpent attack Eve he did not come and say God didn't create the heavens God is the one the creator of the earth God ain't the one the creator of the animals he come through the Simplicity of God's word he he didn't go to the doctrines he'll come to the Simplicity Heaven Come on follow me now he didn't go and say God ain't a God he is the creator but he come to his word he wasn't denying but there wasn't a God but he was denying the power of His word that the devil well it's okay with you coming to church and raising your hand but once it comes to the approach of Faith to his word that's where he's going to attack every time and that's where he fell she started to embrace the wisdom of the world and whenever she embraced the wisdom of the world she refused the wisdom of God but you notice what the Bible says he says you will be as gods that was already as God's Adam was already speaking to the storm he was speaking to Nature he named all the animals the Bible says so he was already living in the position of a minor God because of the wisdom of God come on now and so what the devil was doing through worldly wisdom was to bring them from their position and that's what the devil is trying to do to the pride of Christ he knows that there's a God he can't argue that with you he knows that God has saved your soul he can't argue with that but what he will do will try to bring you from your position as a as a minor God that could speak to the sickness that can speak to the circumstances he comes with worldly wisdom it says God don't mean that God don't God's God's unfilled with the Holy Ghost anymore he may have filled you but your children they can't be healed with the Holy Ghost your grandpa might have got a hill from cancer but your children they can't get healed anymore what he is doing is he's coming with worldly wisdom trying to pull you from your position but I say don't listen to worldly wisdom listen to the wisdom the goddess sent in this generation Hallelujah so now Adam and Eve is no longer speaking to the storm but they're looking for shelter they're no longer petting Leo the Lion but now they're running from Leo the Lion they're not living eternally no longer but now they've got aches and they've got pains that's why worldly wisdom will do but there's been a wisdom that's been given in this neighbor the praying them says the worldly wisdom is what is destroying the Earth worldly wisdom he says you've got gunpowder you've got gases you've got electricity it's all destroying the Earth so worldly wisdom is destroying the Earth but the Heavenly wisdom is what's going to redeem the Earth the worldly wisdom is destroying man's bodies through drugs through vaping through smoking through all of these uh all these foods and everything but it's the Heavenly wisdom that is going to redeem the bodies of the brine there's a worldly wisdom but at the same time through Simplicity God has given us a wisdom Hallelujah he's given us something you look at Genesis 2 and 17 but the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the knowledge that's what is being partaken of today is knowledge we're smart the Bible says in first our second Timothy 3 and 7 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth there's two knowledges they're eating of the knowledge of the world but since they're eating of that since they're approaching that the knowledge of the truth the wisdom they cannot partake of oh my but this is the age of intelligence the world is so smart but at the same time there's an intelligence that's been given to the bride oh my here here's the quote I was talking about brother Branham says he's destroyed himself with this gunpowder if it's electric lights it pulls gases out of the earth wisdom root to and fro knowledge shall increase and they brought themselves a hydrogen bomb now I don't know what they're going to do automobiles every time a man God destroys nothing man destroys himself by worldly wisdom the first conflicts that ever come to the world was because of somebody was seeking after worldly wisdom instead of simple faith there's the approach he says they're seeking after worldly wisdom instead of simple Faith so the way to approach God the Simplicity of God is through simple Faith the mystery of God is hid from the wise and prudent but at the same time the Bible says this in Ephesians 1 and 8 wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence so this is the same thing that the wise can't see because of this they're saying they don't understand the Mysteries because they're wise and prudent but at the same time he hath abandoned toward us in all wisdom and Prudence what's the difference having made known unto us the mystery of his will so the world has been a reversed they're trying to figure out the Mysteries through their wisdom but the pride through wisdom or through the Mysteries has figured our wisdom hallelujah we're the right wisest group on Earth that may have went to college seminaries Bible colleges but there's a wisdom that is surpassing the world surpassing the ones with the highest degrees surpassing and one day where this wisdom is going to change our bodies hallelujah it's something that is transforming our life it's so simple but I can't help but believe it the Bible says in First Corinthians 2 and 4 and my speech and my preaching was not in not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power so he's saying here man's Wisdom would not produce the demonstration of the arm of the Lord I'm not coming to you with man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God albeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princess of this world and come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory he says it's a hidden wisdom but not everybody can see but the simple but the ones that are willing to be that's willing to be to be taught they're the ones that the the mystery the wisdom is being restored to you see that's the only way you can approach God approach the Simplicity it's by faith you look up at the random says oh you say oh the morning star and the evening star is both the same Darcy the same light that was given in the morning does the same in the evening it's the same Evening Star the world has just turned around let's all see so it's not so complicated after all it's just simple Faith to believe God notice the Way Up Is Down it is said we must believe God we must take all his word we must not try to figure things out he says just believe it so you don't got to figure out if thou the evening star is there in the evening and The Morning Star it's in the morning you don't got to figure it out it's the same star in other words don't complicate it just believe that it's going to happen nothing can keep that from coming to pass so the same Sun the rose in the East is the same Sun that is going to set in the west the same the Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new the purifier of the Old Testament is the same pair of fire of the new and the same color of fire that appeared above our Prophet we don't gotta figure it out how simple faith and believe it the same Holy Ghost the fell in the upper room is the same holy ghost that is falling today the same power the hill blind bolameus is the same power that is Healing The Sick that is setting the the captives free we we don't gotta figure it out it's simple faith in the simplicity we don't got to figure out electricity we don't got to figure it out all we got to do is hook up the panel and flip on the breakers there was already somebody else that figured out how it works you see if there's some electricians here and we've we put in panels but the worst thing that people can do is try to figure out the problems on their own and so what happens is they get it all mixed up they get everything all confused because they're trying to figure something out that somebody else has already figured out come on now we don't got to try to figure out how all of these things is going to take place all I know is I'm going to make a Rapture all I know is I'm the Spotless Pride that he saw before the foundation of the world hey come on now we don't gotta try to figure it out just have faith in it you see what did Benjamin Franklin do he just discovered what was already there he didn't create electricity he just discovered what everybody was living without and so after it was discovered nobody else had to go out and try to discover it it was already found now the only thing the people had to do was take what he discovered and put it into action Put on turn on my light bulb turn on the switch we don't gotta go with the tank and trying to figure it out it's already been figured out we don't got to try to interpret the word it's already been interpreted oh my God but what happens is we get a lot of preachers and turn off the breakers and say God don't heal no more turn the breaker off God don't fill it the Holy Ghost turns the breaker off and so now the Lance is going off just in this building all the other people's got electricity all the other buildings have power all the other homes has got electricity but once you start to turn off Breakers you're losing power in your own building and that's what happens when you do away with scripture oh man Malachi 4 that's not for today you're flipping off of that oh God don't heal no more you're flipping off a lack oh God don't save anymore you're flipping off a lot but turn on the breakers the electricity is here the arm of the Lord is here the power of God is here to change bodies to change lives turn on the lights turn on the power turn on the strength of the Lord oh Hallelujah if the Bible says it we can believe it if the Bible says that we can March over the ashes of the wicked work on a March if the Bible says believe and you can speak the word I'm gonna speak the word if the Bible says by your stripes I'm Healed I'm going to believe it if the Bible says it I believe it I don't gotta figure it out I believe it brother Branham says God always sins or Revival well uh before they write about he says just simple Faith to take him at his word or that they trying to complicate it they try to make it so great and then he says God's sins always sins are Revival of Simplicity that preach the thing to Pieces that's right that's what we need today it's the simpleness that's what the nation needs today it's the Simplicity of faith in Christ to surrender themselves unselfishly with their whole heart he says that's what they did in England they made that that that that that message so complicated that people couldn't understand it and he says God always sins simplicity so break that up and let the people know it's simple if you can just put your faith in it if you can just believe it oh my what a Matthew 16 and 16 say and Simon Peter answered and said thou what the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee for worthy wisdom has not revealed unto you but my Father which is in heaven the Heavenly wisdom has brought this Revelation he says you're blessed and I say if you've got a revelation with this heavenly wisdom you're blessed because not everybody can sin but blessed are you it was through the Simplicity of faith that Peter would say thou art the Christ it was the Simplicity of faith that Peter would say where would we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life he couldn't explain it but he believed it it was the Simplicity of Faith you know it was Jesus that says if you eat my flesh and Shrink my blood you don't have no part in me if you don't do these things and the Bible says the multitudes turned away and they walked away brother random says they were thinking he's a vampire he's this he's that and Jesus turned around to the twelfth to his disciples and says will you leave me also they will the multitudes were leaving because of worldly wisdom but these others had a Heavenly wisdom and they said where would we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life brother random says they didn't know what he was talking about but they believed it they couldn't explain it but they believe it you might not be able to explain some things but your simple faith says I can't hope I believe it I can't help but believe it brother random says well thought you might say Dr Dr so and so doesn't believe it this way he says but that doesn't change God's word a bit that doesn't change God's word a bit they may walk away and says this is false but that still don't change the power of it he says you're not saved by education you're not saved by wisdom you are saved by faith this Faith as the musicians come it's faith that is going to get this this Earth in a redeemed condition like I said earlier it's Earthly wisdom that is destroying the Earth but it's the Heavenly wisdom that is going to redeem it you see it was worldly wisdom why many build boats in Noah's day but they all sank but it was a Heavenly wisdom that no one could ride the waves it was unhealthy wisdom the Cain's sacrificed sacrifice was refused but it was a Heavenly wisdom the Ables was accepted there's two wisdoms going on but there's a Heavenly wisdom that God is accepting the Tower of Babel was worldly wisdom trying to approach God built the Tower to reach the heavens but the approach of worldly wisdom can't reach God but it was by faith Enoch approached God he walked with God till God took him and the Bible says before he was translated he had this testimony that he pleased God what's the Bible say how do you please God by faith so how did he approach God by faith oh that's powerful friends it was by faith that he approached God the Tower of Babel was refused they was trying to get to heaven that was trying to reach God but God says now I'm refusing that wisdom but I'm giving you a wisdom and if you can approach it if you can have a testimony of faith you can approach me you can step up into this other atmosphere and I say that this morning the only way to approach this message is by faith you can't approach it by denominational wisdoms you can't approach it a theology wisdoms you can approach it by worldly wisdoms the only way you can approach this message is by faith the only way to approach God Is by faith brother Branham says this one more quote we're going 1600 miles of an hour today and still moving on because science is eating off this tree of knowledge and we're over here the preachers oh the knowledge will only run so far then it falls backwards but the tree of life has no into it we've got untapped resources and he says you're scared to step out and take God at his word I don't care if you want Moody was all right he was in his day like a scientist with my brother we're not traveling in the ox cart the Church of the Living God is moving in a Jet Plane we're moving up the road signs and wonders we're just starting omnipotent is speaking the miraculous is happening why don't you get in and go with us he says we'll be glad to have you along with us he says the knowledge is only going to go so far but the wisdom that's been given there's untapped resources eternity has been open to us Heaven has been open to us healing has been open to us Deliverance has been open to us the Holy Ghost has been opened to us untapped resources we haven't even scratched the surface you think you got peace there's more peace for you you think you've got Char there's more joy for you there's untapped resources in this wisdom you may be feeling low this morning there's untapped resources you may feel like your world is about to fall apart there's untapped resources let's bow our heads tonight dear heavenly father the Lord thank you for this wisdom that you've given us Lord you've given us an understanding about the lies can't even see you but Lord because of this wisdom we've become wise Lord we know all Heaven's been opened up to us eternity has been opened up to us healing Lord salvation for our loved ones Lord if there's somebody here that's living below their means may they step up with courage and approach you with faith Lord if there's somebody here that has a condition in their body and they're needing you to come Lord may they approach you in faith this morning and say you're the god the heel of my diseases by your stripes I'm Healed he was bruised from my iniquities Lord May there be a generation rise to the challenge we thank you for these things Jesus name amen oh God of Jacob and Give Us Clean Hands give us pure hearts let us not lift our souls to another Give Us Clean Hands give us your hearts let us not lift our souls to another God let us be generation that seeks [Music] if there's somebody here that has a need is open she's needing God to do something for you the arm of the Lord is revealing itself the power of the Lord is in the building this morning with the Holy Ghost who encourage to uplift [Music] s [Music] our souls to another Give Us Clean Hands yes Lord let us not lift
