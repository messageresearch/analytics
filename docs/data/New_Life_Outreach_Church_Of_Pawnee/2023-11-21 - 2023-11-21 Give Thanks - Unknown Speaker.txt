enjoyed those specials this evening brother John that was wonderful amen praise the Lord and uh we sure appreciate uh uh brother John and his family enjoyed uh both those songs tonight and uh and I I you know I always love sister Leah singing and and um amen we've got a lot to be thankful for we got a roof over our head amen and we're we're so blessed here this evening amen well um it's good to see um brother Timothy and brother Levi with us didn't call you Timothy JR this time and uh amen so good to uh see yall it's been so good to have you guys with us and um well thanksgiving's right around the corner that's the reason why we're here on a Tuesday night amen and so why don't we look here in the book of um uh Psalms in the 50th chapter amen uh enjoy uh seeing our our uh upcoming guitar players and love them and we we love brother Merl amen and uh just love everyone here tonight in the house of the Lord we're just going to um just talk a little bit about giving thanks and um amen take advantage of the season to to uh for us to to count our blessings amen I I'm just going to read um amen um let's see I let let's look here at Psalms 50 um amen and let's just look here at the eth verse I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifice or of thy burnt offerings to have been continually before me I will take no bulock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy folds for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle Upon A Thousand Hills and I know all the fowls I of the mountains and the wild beast of the field are mine if I were hungry I would not tell thee for the world is mine and the fullness thereof I will eat will I eat the the Flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats offer unto God Thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high amen how many wants to offer Thanksgiving and pay our vows let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you today for your goodness to us you've been so merciful you've been so kind Lord we thank you for these wonderful specials and all three of those songs had just such great meaning on these specials Lord we thank you for the song service that brother Kobe had had led us in worship and father our heart is to give you things we love you Lord with all of our heart you've been so good to us this year and Lord we're just wanting to to let you know we appreciate you and we thank you for all that you are and Lord we're asking that you would help us as we Minister your word tonight and ask Lord that you would be with both speaker and the hearer and asking Lord that you would be honored Among Us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated tonight amen I amen want to offer My Vow unto God and I just want to just talk for a few moments this evening on giving thanks and amen and what it should mean to us amen Leviticus 22 and 29 it says now when you offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving unto the Lord offer it at your own will amen it should not be something that is uh that is you're made to do it should not be something that you are and if you wouldn't mind just leaving that up there for a moment sister kalila it should not be something that we amen that is required to do but when you offer thanks to the Lord do it at your own will doing it at your own will requires you looking at God Amen and as as as not just nature God is not just uh man you don't you're not here what you have is not coincidence or good luck you have been blessed by the Lord you have been blessed by the Lord and so God is requiring that when you offer amen a sacrifice of Thanksgiving unto the Lord do it from your heart do it from your own will when you come and offer amen and of course this is talking about coming amen an offering unto the Lord and the sanctuary amen and and you're bringing your sacrifice of Thanksgiving to God Amen you're you you're not depending upon the preacher or the priest you're not depending upon the song leader you you are coming readily amen from your heart to to give everything you've got unto the Lord amen so so offer back to Psalms 50 and uh or let's look here at at um amen I let's see here Psalms 50 and4 it says offer unto God Thanksgiving pay thy vows unto the Lord Psalm 69 and3 I will praise the name of the Lord and will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving amen a a very common scripture is Psalms 100 verse4 enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name now when we look at these Scriptures it is it is actually referring to when you're coming into the house of the Lord amen now it was established by King David that there were the Levites that were to there were worship leaders amen and and these leaders were to amen lead the people in Psalms before the Lord and they were to come and to offer praise unto God Amen and we see we read there if you were to go look in in Nehemiah the 11th and 12th chapter when they have coming back out of Amen Babylon and they are setting up the order one of the first things that they set up were the worship leaders and so I I I want to say God bless our worship leaders they're not song leaders they're worship leaders now we we all call them song leaders too but they lead us in worship amen but they are not to be the ones doing the singing We Are to do the singing they they in order to keep us all together Amen in unity they might pick the song that the spirit of the Lord puts upon their heart but where to do the singing where to Worship the Lord can you say amen amen and and you know you you um Nehemiah uh uh 12 and8 we're not going to read everything but amen it says moreover the Le Levites jhua uh Benny uh cat mile uh sh B Shah Judah and and Mah which was over the Thanksgiving he and his Brethren if you go down to the 46th verse it says for in the days of David and of assf of old there were chief of the singers songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God so so there there should be something within our hearts you know amen so we come to church charged we come to church we can't wait to get together so that we can express Thanksgiving unto the Lord that means the song leader ain't the one that's been doing it and we're just sitting there just looking and Hallelujah come on now we should come charged ready to pay our vows unto the Lord now how can this happen you say brother wendle I you know I I'm just that's just not the way I am I'm just not one of those kind of guys that that that express it amen you're just a person that is not thankful and the reason you're not thankful is because you don't uh you're not looking about your life and understanding how great God has been to you because I have a feeling it doesn't matter how whether you're expressive or not when you can truly understand that everything that you have and everything that you are is because God has been good to you then you want to express it to him I don't care if you sing on key out of key it doesn't matter amen whether you whistle like brother Timothy or amen or or or or or however you do it you're doing KN at from the from the depths of your soul because you are blessed now brother Harry brought it in the other night and I I I appreciated all of the uh all of the uh sermonettes and the testimonies the other night a Sunday night and they were all just were were so wonderful but brother Harry talked about Thanksgiving and and and and a thankful heart and how that even science is saying that if if if you if you would start counting your blessings and you start think thankful for what uh you have amen it can run the spirit of depression off and these are guys these are guys that don't even amen that that might not even be Believers but just the law of Thanksgiving the law of Thanksgiving can move the clouds away how much more somebody that knows their god well praise the Lord Psalms 92 And1 it says amen uh it is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord to sing praises unto thy name oh most high to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night upon an instrument of 10 strings upon the Salt Tree upon the harp with a solemn sound for thou Lord Hast made me glad glad through thy work I will Triumph how am I going to Triumph in the work of thy hands oh Lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep a brutish man or a stupid dull hearted unreceptive man knows not neither do a fool understand this can I hear an amen you see we're blessed amen it's no wonder there in Psalms 103 and 1 David says bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name why don't you repeat that amen bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name amen bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender Mercy who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles you see David is looking at something amen He is wanting to express what is he doing he is looking at the Covenant of God he's looking at the blessings of God he is looking and saying God God has been good to me amen I I preached a message one time on Amen uh on blessings and amen and and blessing the Lord amen and but I I when I look there amen at the word blessed did you know that the word bless it it it it shows up in the scripture amen 330 times in the Bible amen that thaty word blessed it comes from the Hebrew word Barack amen and and and and 330 times and most it is God that is doing the blessing so David is saying bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name but you see David is looking now that word that David is blessing it's it it's it's giving honor it's giving reverence it means to bow down to it means to prostrate yourself amen before God and and express Thanksgiving unto him but you see God blessed he was the first to bless and that word bless means favor amen so God Favored humanity and He blesses matters of fact there in Psalms 104 and 27 it says these all wait upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat in due season that thou givest them that thou givest them they gather thou openest thine hand and they are filled with good thou hidest thy face and they are troubled thou takest away their breath they die and return to dust thou sendest forth thy spirit and they are created and renew renewest the face of the Earth can you say Amen so God is the one who gives the blessing it's God who gives the favor it's God who gives you your job it's God Amen that gives you the health it's God that has blessed you with such wonderful children as Josh mentioned the other night amen children that that's got all of their fingers and toes children that that that are for the most part sane and sound amen children that are amen that you know we we we are blessed and it is God who has shown favor to us amen it is God that shows favor in the morning times when you wake up well praise the Lord amen it's favor it's God that has been showing favor to you you say oh I've got a good marriage it's because God's been favorable to you there's a lot of good people that's that's divorced amen there's a lot of good people that amen but but here you are tonight and and if you've got a a good husband that's loving you it's because God's been favorable to you if you've got a wife that loves you it's God's been favorable well praise the Lord amen if you're if you're here today amen and and and and all of the statistics are against you and you're still standing here is because God's been favorable unto you I look I look all around this amen we have so many things now amen I you know I I you know I I I stand uh here tonight with you know with with with a few aches and pains here even now behind the pull pit amen and and and and and I could I it'd be easy you know or well some people might say well you know I'm aching here and I've got this and I've got that but brother we got to quit we got to quit magnifying and lifting up the name of the devil and all of the hurts and the pains God's being good to to us giving us a heart of love for him and and Hallelujah I'm just thankful I'm thankful that I can still stand behind the pull pit and preach I'm thankful that I can still walk I'm thankful I know I've got glasses but I'm thankful I can still see amen I'm thankful that I can still hear I'm thankful that I can still move around I've been blessed God has been favorable to me amen he shows that favor can you say amen and it's because of his loving kindness and I believe that's what David was so excited about his as he's as he's sitting there thinking of all that God has been he's loving kindness he's he's forgiven me he's shown Mercy to me David was one who who who didn't always have it put together David was one that that amen is that right but God had a covenant with David amen and we think about that song when I think about the Lord how he saved me how he raised me how he lifted me up and turned me around and he placed my feet on S holid ground it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord I love you amen you're are worthy of all the glory and all the honor I give you praise can you say Amen it's because God has been good now I know our church don't have we don't have the biggest of Youth groups and we ain't got the biggest of we don't have a whole lot of programs amen that maybe other churches can can can can can offer and we ain't we we ain't we ain't down on those guys that can offer it hey amen if we had the money we'd be doing it too praise the Lord amen so so we're thankful for those other guys that's that that can offer programs and that can have these kinds of things and amen but I want to tell you you young people don't have to be in a in a in a in a in a you know a big church that's got all of uh you know the the amenities of life to to to to uh uh you know uh to keep you satisfied you're blessed you're blessed because you've got a church here that loves you hallelujah hallelujah amen I I you're blessed you're you're learning music you're learning to play uh you know play the guitar the piano you're learning these kind God's blessed you with that amen I I you know thinking about our our our fellowship and our Brotherhood together and all of the guys out right now amen or a bunch of us are out hunting and amen Brotherhood and we just got a lot of camarad there and amen what it we're blessed to have one another the way we have one another amen I'm glad for Brotherhood I'm glad for Fellowship well praise the Lord but we're blessed for that Psalms 63 and 3 because thy loving kindness is better than life now come on now better than the deer hunting better than learning to play the guitar better than having that pretty woman sitting beside you better than life we've got life good but I've got something that's even better than life God has been good God has been favorable thy loving kindness is better than life and my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up mine hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with moral and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou Hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wing aren't you glad for the protection of God will I Rejoice now as we think about this what this season means and not going to hold you too long tonight but I think as the Apostle Peter says stir up he says well I'm in this Tabernacle I want to stir you up by way of remembrance because I want to remind you that you have not followed a cunningly devised Fable when we made known unto you this mystery of the gospel and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ I've not pointed you to a totem po I've not pointed you to a god of wood or stone we pointed you to something that's real a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ we were eyewitnesses of his majesty and his presence is still here can you say Amen When God says to Adam and Eve amen when when he says and God blessed them that means something when God told Abraham him amen I'm going to bless thee and I'm going to bless them that bless thee and because of my blessings upon you you're going to be a blessing to the world and as long as they can see the blessings of God upon you and honor you I will bless them oh praise the Lord now blessings are not just the natural things because lot had the Natural Things lot lot lived in Sodom lot was the mayor amen lot lot he he he he become quite wealthy down there in in Sodom he raised his family his children they got married in Sodom they were they were quite they they were quite the become the elders in the city like a mayor his family had a lot of prestige but lot did not know that the fire was fixing to fall so things does not mean favor things does not mean fav favor and so while we're thanking God for the things and we're thankful for the things but genuine favor is when God comes in and ignites your soul energizes your soul to see the supernatural real that this place is fixing to burn now I'm thankful for the temporal things but those are temporal temporal temporal you might get a new bow but that's temporal might have a pretty girlfriend and that could be temporal you could you could have you could have pretty cars and that be temporal asked brother Kobe about his truck amen nice beautiful truck and he had it for so long and then this old lady comes in and just I mean she scrapes the entire truck all the way down I was a beautiful truck amen it was temporal you were blessed for a couple days amen temporal these are temporal blessings and though we count those blessings we do not hold those blessings as if they're enduring Abraham was told to walk the length and the breadth of the of the land he was blessed but you see Abraham was not just walking the length and the bread for a natural blessing the scripture says he sought for a city whose Builder and maker was God Eternal in the heavens so he had the natural blessings lot had the natural blessings but lot did not have the aptitude or the spiritual ey sight to be able to know that all of this was fixing to burn Abraham sought with the spiritual eye and to me that's blessing thank God for a youth group but that's not the main thing thank God for all of his blessings thank God for friendship thank God for Brotherhood thank God for all of these things but there's a lot of people who's been part of a Brotherhood even in this church who did not have spiritual eyesight so if you have eyes to see what God is doing today now it's easy for us to see what God has done yesterday it's easy for us to look back and see what God has done through Malachi 4 but we need eyesight to see that God is doing something today and to have those kind of eyes to seek the Lord as Abraham did when lot was down there and in all of the prestige Abraham was sitting over there am man in that hot Barren land and maybe he had just rested a little bit from from from from walking the land and thinking about the that Supernatural presence of God and thinking about that City I know this land is wonderful and God's given me a promise of a natural seed but that one who talked to me was greater than just any kind of a natural man that I've ever seen that Supernatural something that met me at the beginning and said leave your Kindred and leave it all I'm giving you a promise and as he's sitting there thinking that day in that hot sun amen and he's got his feet kicked back or is his his his his chair kicked back a little bit as the prophet would say and he and he's Fanning himself with that little F fly uh uh Bush thing and he and and he's there and then all of a sudden he sees these men come up and he looks and in his spiritual eye he saw not just two men he saw God and when he looked there God Appears and he didn't say my lords he says as my Lord and when God comes up to him in the form of Flesh Abraham wasn't looking in the natural he done experience the supernatural do you see how Abraham was blessed lot didn't have that experience lot didn't have that Revelation amen don't let this message just become some other kind of a religious Affair walk with God in the Supernatural can you say amen amen my ti is coming down praise the Lord so we we are thankful we're thankful for that Supernatural there was a supernatural element that they could see the destruction in the land they were blessed did you know that the Bible says Noah was blessed the rest of the world had things but Noah seen the Escape he was blessed uh uh uh Joshua and Caleb were blessed everyone else was looking at a natural land and they couldn't get their eyes off the natural things but those two men seen something supernaturally while the rest of the people while the rest of the people when when when when Moses went up in the mountain with God and and he come back 40 days later and they had all backslid and they were dancing around naked uh uh naked dancing around a Goen calf that they had built it was Joshua and Caleb that were sitting at the foot of the mountain it was Joshua and Caleb that would stand there and they would begin to pick his brain every time that he would come down from God because they seen the globe they seen this the the the pillar of fire upon him and their eyes were open and it was those men that were blessed it was those men that conquered it was those men that overcome I say we're blessed can you say man I say tonight we could go on all down through the scripture but I think you can I I think you're catching my drift here tonight right you catching my drift blessed blessed so Thanksgiving is a returning back it's it's after us seeing God for who he is he is the only Giver of Life he is the only Giver of of Grace he is the only one that's not mortal then we can turn around and give him real genuine thanks from our heart it don't matter whether you're sick it don't matter whether you're struggling in in your body whether you're like my my father who who actually was we we we we had him scheduled to minister Sunday morning amen I said even if it was for 20 minutes or so while you're strong and you got a strong voice I want you to minister and make make it a make it a special day and and uh but when he woke up he couldn't move and he was he's he's getting the trimor now in his in his left side and and and so now you know they done the brain surgery thing that that helped with the trimmer on the right now he's fighting it on his left but you see Dad Dad could look there and in the glooms but I I I say there's something there's something beyond the the the the normal health of the body dad is blessed he's blessed with something beyond measure he's got a he's got a he's got a an eyesight that is greater than anything here of this Earth can you say Amen maybe you're struggling maybe you've got this that and the other I say today get your eyes off of whatever it is get your eyes off of your Mountain get your eyes off of your sea get your eyes off of your trouble this season get your eyes off of everything and just start looking at what God has done for you because you're blessed amen blessings a money thankful for it and I'm thankful for every temporal blessing that God gives but I'm so thankful I'm so thankful that I'm not like the hog that is under the tree eating the apples and never look up to see where they come from I'm thankful come on now I'm thankful to sing I I'm thankful that God's given me a a talent to sing I'm thankful I'm thankful that I can play music I I I'm thankful that I can preach a sermon I I'm thankful that I can but Elvis could do all that too well praise the Lord amen and he could probably do it better than me but eternal life eternal life is where the blessings come from I I I I would like I would like for it to so register in our hearts it right now in in in this season here that we would go this next year with such a praise that this that that we' raise the roof off of this place and not just around Thanksgiving but I mean told we would have such a praise such a free will offering such a paying our vows from our heart not because I have to but something that's excited to give our are praise to him not because the preacher not because mama not because Daddy no I am bless I'm blessed from him I'm blessed praise the Lord aren't you thankful for that Hallelujah we are thankful so as as we close now it's God's blessings I I thought of the how how precious it is for us to come to these worship services and and how important it is for the preacher The Minister's job as as preachers we're not priests but we're preachers how beautiful are the feet of them who bring preach the gospel of glad tidings amen and I think of this scripture because it's after the same ordinance this is here is in in in in uh numbers the 6th chapter and the 23rd verse and the reason I'm bringing this in is because I think it's this is this is the time that we bring our offerings now we're thankful outddors and we're and we're and we're very blessed but but it's accumulated love and prayer and blessings that God has and the realities throughout the week that when we come into church how precious it is and the Levites were to pronounce the blessings of God upon the people and this was this is what God commanded them numbers 6 and 23 speak unto Aaron and his son saying on this wise you shall bless the children of Israel saying unto them the Lord bless thee and keep Thee the Lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them you go back and the scripture says all the way back to the very last chapter of the Book of Revelations he says if you should add or take away anything let me just read that to you as as the musicians prepare to come if you should let's see see um the 22 and 18 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in the book and if any man shall take away from the words of this book uh uh words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things that are written therein can you see man now it's a curse it's a curse If any man take any of the blessings out of it if you if you mess with anything it becomes a curse but then the scripture says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word but he says blessed is he that heareth or readeth the words of this prophecy now I want I want you to really think about this why why are we so blessed because for Seven Ages no one had every word it was in symbols but in this generation the Lord has given us every word we've been favored we're not back in the fifth age or the sixth age or or or or or the or the opening uh you know the the coming in of the seventh age we're at the end of the seventh age where every word has been brought to us so that there can be Faith the name of the Lord can be upon us it's a privilege to live by every word it's a privilege to believe every word It's My Heart of Thanksgiving to him to pay my vows for what I have received y y'all understanding how beautiful it is oh let's love him folks if they can if they can shout and rejoice out there in the denominational world and amen and and they might not have every word well ain't no might not about it God sent a prophet to us to restore us back the lamb has opened the book we should be thankful for every word bless the Lord what the scripture says and the blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee I Will Bless thee in the field I will bless you coming in going out I will bless why because we're in our land we're in that promise that God's given us can you say Amen oh I thank God for [Music] that the anointing of the Holy Spirit opening the Word of Life To Us in this generation I I I I just can't help but believe that if it really hit home if it really ever hits home it'll it'll change us it'll totally change us Prophet says when the bride finds it out but she truly comes to that Revelation she he says the Rapture will have to take place these old bodies won't be able to contain it I just say Lord just keep on feeding me keep on revealing yourself to me I just I I I I I'm just I want to fall in love with you more and more and more and more and more praise the Lord God bless you tonight let's stand to our [Music] feet praise the Lord I want to pay my vow I want to give him everything that I am I think the greatest thing that we
