[58:04] you know most of you know that I was uh
[58:06] privileged to be born and raised in
[58:09] Jeffersonville and and uh raised in the
[58:11] Branham Tabernacle there
[58:13] you know I I can tell stories for two or
[58:16] three hours about things I've seen in
[58:18] Miracles but what happens if I tell one
[58:21] then others come to mind and the next
[58:23] thing you know that's all I get done but
[58:26] uh there was one special uh time there
[58:29] we were sitting in the Branham
[58:30] Tabernacle one Sunday morning and there
[58:32] is a famous story of brother Branham
[58:35] healing a little girl in Germany who
[58:38] didn't have any eyeballs and you all
[58:40] know the story and he's he said to her
[58:42] he said honey if he said if you had
[58:44] eyeballs what color would you like and
[58:47] she said well I've heard that blue was
[58:48] nice and he prayed for her and her eyes
[58:50] opened she had she had eyeballs and I
[58:53] didn't see that but I was sitting in the
[58:55] Tabernacle one Sunday morning and there
[58:57] was a little blind girl which lived
[58:59] there in in Jeffersonville we all knew
[59:01] she was blind and brother Branham had
[59:03] finished the preaching and he was
[59:04] Discerning some things and uh he he

[59:11] sister here from Jeffersonville and he
[59:13] said she blind and he's but now she had
[59:16] eyeballs but she was just blind and he
[59:18] called her up there and I was just
[59:19] sitting right close and and uh
[59:22] he prayed a little prayer faith and laid
[59:24] his fingers on her eyelids and when she
[59:27] raised or when she uh when he prayed for
[59:30] her eyes opened and she began shouting
[59:32] and screaming that's the god that we
[59:34] serve now listen those things that I can

[1:12:45] it's good to be gathered together again
[1:12:47] one more time and
[1:12:50] in New Life Outreach
[1:12:52] it's honor and a blessing to be here in
[1:12:54] Oklahoma for the first time and
[1:12:57] we've certainly enjoyed ourselves and
[1:13:01] what a grand time we've had
[1:13:05] sister Mara who is not with me here
[1:13:07] today and
[1:13:08] maybe there's another year another
[1:13:10] opportunity possibly she'd come back and
[1:13:13] be with us
[1:13:15] we've been married 43 years and
[1:13:19] that only makes me 50.
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:24] and a few more years
[1:13:27] I'm 62 years old but we got married when
[1:13:30] we were just kids and
[1:13:31] I was 18 she was 16 and a half and
[1:13:35] two lovely children Jonah's here with us
[1:13:37] and Isaac his son which we're thankful
[1:13:40] they could travel with us
[1:13:42] three generations here which is a
[1:13:44] blessing
[1:13:46] sister Mara gives her greetings and her
[1:13:48] love to you and
[1:13:50] she says God bless you
[1:13:54] it's such a blessing to see brother
[1:13:56] Dan's sister Dolly here as well from
[1:13:58] Canada
[1:13:59] I didn't even get permission to come and
[1:14:01] I feel pretty good to be here brother
[1:14:03] Dan
[1:14:04] because it's good to be here
[1:14:06] in Pawnee Oklahoma with you
[1:14:09] with all the saints of God and I'd like
[1:14:12] to just say that being my first time in
[1:14:14] Oklahoma but not my first time knowing
[1:14:16] brother wendo known him for many years
[1:14:18] and
[1:14:19] and it's been such a blessing to our
[1:14:22] church
[1:14:23] sister Jessica and himself and
[1:14:26] while the Oklahoma
[1:14:28] hospitality is over the top
[1:14:32] it's kind of that kind of hospitality
[1:14:34] that says my goodness and
[1:14:36] there's nothing that we have need of the
[1:14:38] accommodations are over the top and the
[1:14:40] food and
[1:14:42] everything that is taken care of and we
[1:14:45] say from the depths of our heart brother
[1:14:46] Wendell to your church God bless you and
[1:14:49] thank you for taking care of us while
[1:14:51] we're here
[1:15:02] as it's been said already the music is
[1:15:04] wonderful specials are incredible
[1:15:08] I thought this morning we should have a
[1:15:10] sing in service and I actually thought
[1:15:11] it was going that way and I thought we
[1:15:13] should have just kept on after brother
[1:15:14] Kenny and
[1:15:16] because I don't know if there's anything
[1:15:18] more to preach I guess we have the
[1:15:21] the introduction of the Bible we can
[1:15:22] turn to this morning but
[1:15:25] Brothers certainly did a wonderful time
[1:15:27] and it's an honor to stand together with
[1:15:29] these Great Men of God I say God bless
[1:15:31] each and every one of you have been
[1:15:33] enriched by your Ministries and as I'm
[1:15:35] going home with a new person
[1:15:38] more determined to press the good fight
[1:15:41] of faith I appreciated that brother
[1:15:42] Darryl give your all to the Gospel of
[1:15:46] Jesus Christ
[1:15:47] I think that was good for all of us
[1:15:50] sometimes in life we can get a little
[1:15:52] bit this way or that way get caught up
[1:15:54] just with the busyness of life and we
[1:15:56] forget what the real part is and the
[1:15:58] real thing is in this the things of God
[1:16:01] but it's good to hear it again and to
[1:16:04] be able to move ourselves back into a
[1:16:07] place that God would be pleased with us
[1:16:10] so I say God bless you to a man of God
[1:16:13] that are here the pastors evangelists
[1:16:15] that are here God bless richly bless
[1:16:17] each and every one of you it's an honor
[1:16:19] to get to know some of you I've heard
[1:16:21] your names before
[1:16:23] but it's just an honor to see you
[1:16:26] put a name to the face and
[1:16:28] it says great is the Lord good to us
[1:16:32] I've thoroughly enjoyed myself in these
[1:16:34] meetings and
[1:16:36] and well we have one more to go so yeah
[1:16:39] yeah if you have your Bibles this
[1:16:41] morning I'd like to turn to a few
[1:16:43] scripture verses if I could to Psalms
[1:16:45] 44.
[1:16:47] verses one to three
[1:16:50] there's one thing when you're
[1:16:53] the last Minister you you hear the
[1:16:56] different scriptures that are used in
[1:16:58] the different quotes that are used in
[1:17:00] and you
[1:17:02] say well he just took my scripture and
[1:17:04] he just took my quote
[1:17:08] so if you get to hear it one more time
[1:17:10] this morning
[1:17:12] just bear with me this morning
[1:17:16] when brother
[1:17:18] the brother was preaching yesterday
[1:17:21] I thought my goodness if he keeps on
[1:17:23] going I'm locking up no scriptures left
[1:17:25] then
[1:17:26] I'd written down I thought brother
[1:17:28] Andrew just stop right there
[1:17:32] here we are this morning
[1:17:34] I certainly enjoyed that last night
[1:17:37] all the services I've thoroughly enjoyed
[1:17:40] we have heard with our ears oh God our
[1:17:43] fathers have told us
[1:17:45] what work thou did Us in the in their
[1:17:48] day and in the days of old
[1:17:50] how thou did us drive out the Heathen
[1:17:52] with thy hand
[1:17:54] and plantus them
[1:17:56] how thou disaff afflict the people in
[1:17:58] castamon
[1:18:00] for they got not to land in possession
[1:18:02] by their own sword
[1:18:04] neither did their own arms say them but
[1:18:06] thy right hand
[1:18:08] and thine arm and the light of thy
[1:18:10] continence because thou had his favor
[1:18:13] unto them
[1:18:15] I believe we are people that the Lord
[1:18:17] has had favor upon us
[1:18:19] amen it's one thing I appreciate the
[1:18:22] testimonies of Years Gone by but I
[1:18:24] certainly do appreciate every testimony
[1:18:26] that the Lord is doing right now in the
[1:18:28] midst of his people
[1:18:30] in this church and around the world
[1:18:32] Romans chapter 8 verse 11. but of the
[1:18:36] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:18:38] the dead dwell in you
[1:18:40] say that's me
[1:18:42] he that raise up Christ from the dead
[1:18:44] shall also Quicken your mortal Body by
[1:18:46] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:18:49] amen we're in that season of time
[1:18:52] First Corinthians 2 4 and 5 brother
[1:18:54] Andrew
[1:18:55] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:18:58] with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[1:19:00] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:19:03] of of power that your faith
[1:19:07] should not let's say should not should
[1:19:10] not stand in the wisdom of men but in
[1:19:14] the power of God
[1:19:15] now if any person had had a right to
[1:19:19] have somebody follow them in his words
[1:19:20] it was Paul
[1:19:22] but Paul said I counted everything but
[1:19:24] done that Christ could be formed in him
[1:19:27] and he did not want people to be looking
[1:19:29] at him but he wanted them to be looking
[1:19:31] at Christ who he was representing on the
[1:19:33] Earth
[1:19:34] and anytime we Minister we we speak the
[1:19:37] word of the Lord if we speak it in a way
[1:19:39] to draw attention to ourselves we're
[1:19:41] doing it up not according to the word of
[1:19:43] God
[1:19:44] we should always give honor and praise
[1:19:46] and glory unto the Living God for he's
[1:19:49] the one that's in our midst and he's the
[1:19:51] one that's doing everything it's by his
[1:19:53] word it's by his sword we're only his
[1:19:56] servants
[1:19:57] amen you can have your seats if you wish
[1:20:00] I'd like to speak this morning briefly
[1:20:03] on the bride is rising up
[1:20:06] if there's ever a Time the bride is
[1:20:08] rising up is in the hour that we're
[1:20:10] living in today
[1:20:11] and this bride that is upon the Earth
[1:20:13] today is not a bride that is that is a
[1:20:16] just a small girl anymore but she is a
[1:20:18] full mature bride of Jesus Christ that's
[1:20:21] here today A bride that has been taught
[1:20:24] by the word of God a bride that knows
[1:20:26] that the god that she serves as a living
[1:20:28] God a bride that is not intimidated by
[1:20:31] men and by intellectualism but a bride
[1:20:34] that is very very into the word of God
[1:20:37] and stands in the word of God and keeps
[1:20:39] herself in the word of God and becomes
[1:20:41] familiar with the word of God she's only
[1:20:43] interested in one diet and not diet is
[1:20:46] the word of God anything else outside of
[1:20:49] that that's interjected into it I'm not
[1:20:51] interested in it I know you're all not
[1:20:53] interested in it we're interested in
[1:20:55] what does God have to say in the word of
[1:20:58] God for this day if there's one thing
[1:21:00] that I find disheartening is when men
[1:21:02] put in denominational ideas into this
[1:21:05] word of God that make us something that
[1:21:08] it's not and that it will bring
[1:21:10] Deliverance to the people that we we've
[1:21:11] got to live with our problems I say we
[1:21:13] don't have to live with your problem we
[1:21:16] got a Living God on the scene here this
[1:21:17] morning hour that's more than able to
[1:21:20] deliver any problem that's in the people
[1:21:22] amen this our God is alive in this hour
[1:21:25] why would we want to go back to
[1:21:28] something that is dead carrying into
[1:21:30] something that is dead when we have
[1:21:32] something that's real in this hour
[1:21:33] something that has truth in this hour
[1:21:36] something that brings Deliverance in
[1:21:38] this hour something that gives us an
[1:21:41] assurance in this hour
[1:21:43] there's something I don't I don't go for
[1:21:45] I don't go for any of that do not of
[1:21:47] that denominational thinking or
[1:21:49] intellectualism we want the power of the
[1:21:51] Living God
[1:21:53] I say this morning or if a man can't
[1:21:55] even can't even hardly preach his way
[1:21:57] out of wet paper bag as we would say but
[1:21:59] if he's got the power of God in his life
[1:22:01] that's the only thing that matters to me
[1:22:03] is the power of the Living God
[1:22:07] that's what the people need that's what
[1:22:09] brings Deliverance to the people
[1:22:11] and this bride has risen up she's not
[1:22:14] she's not just moved around I appreciate
[1:22:15] her brother Sean had to say yesterday we
[1:22:17] just because somebody has a vision or
[1:22:19] somebody has a dream or somebody has
[1:22:21] something well I'm not moved by it I
[1:22:23] wait to find out what it is and I what I
[1:22:25] find out many times is an evil spirit
[1:22:28] and when it is an evil spirit I never
[1:22:30] see that person wanted to get delivered
[1:22:32] from it they just go on to the next
[1:22:33] thing
[1:22:34] amen I say that if we go according to
[1:22:36] the word of God if there's something
[1:22:38] that's not right amen we got to come
[1:22:40] back to the Bible and back to the way
[1:22:42] they handled in the scripture and the
[1:22:44] Bible said if a dreamer or somebody
[1:22:46] prophesies something that is not
[1:22:48] according to the word of God we got a
[1:22:51] right to go back to it and say what you
[1:22:54] said was an heir therefore you've got an
[1:22:56] evil spirit and that Spirit needs to be
[1:22:58] prayed off of you amen they don't want
[1:23:01] to Humble themselves but I say this
[1:23:03] morning our it's good to Humble
[1:23:05] ourselves under the mighty hand of
[1:23:07] almighty God
[1:23:09] let him come on the scene
[1:23:12] a lot of people that to me that's just a
[1:23:14] Corinthian Church
[1:23:16] which was the weakest Church in the
[1:23:18] entire New Testament
[1:23:20] everybody had a dream everybody had a
[1:23:22] saying everybody had something they all
[1:23:24] wanted to try to make themselves
[1:23:25] something when they actually actually
[1:23:27] what they were is they were just a weak
[1:23:29] Church
[1:23:30] amen they wanted the glory for
[1:23:32] everything rather than giving the glory
[1:23:33] to God but I say we find ourselves in
[1:23:36] the book of Ephesians which is where the
[1:23:38] bride is in in the book of Ephesians we
[1:23:40] know who we are we know that we've been
[1:23:43] predestinated onto life we know the sea
[1:23:45] Gene of God is within our hearts amen
[1:23:48] we're not moved by trivial things if
[1:23:50] it's not the word we stand still
[1:23:53] I hope that's okay this morning
[1:23:56] it's going to be the truth or we're not
[1:23:58] interested in it either it comes with a
[1:24:01] message or we're not interested in it
[1:24:03] and what you see in the message If It
[1:24:05] Don't Fit in the Bible you better look
[1:24:06] at it again
[1:24:08] it's gonna fit in the scripture
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:13] I hope this is okay to close the
[1:24:15] meetings out with but
[1:24:18] amen we're the bride we're rising up we
[1:24:20] have risen up
[1:24:22] we're hoping the people will rise up and
[1:24:24] recognize who they are
[1:24:27] a brother Brown said I'm going to say
[1:24:29] something National Force but Israel in
[1:24:31] her Homeland a national force will put
[1:24:33] the church in the world Council of of
[1:24:35] churches but the power let's say the
[1:24:36] power but the power of God will put the
[1:24:39] people in the brine
[1:24:40] amen the world force is this way and the
[1:24:43] world forces that way but God forces
[1:24:45] upward the spirit of God which is the
[1:24:47] word of God my word is spirit and life
[1:24:49] will put the bride in in her place
[1:24:51] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:24:54] the word then she's in Christ we'll put
[1:24:57] her in her place no National Force will
[1:25:00] do it all the things we're going through
[1:25:02] they're not going to put it as God
[1:25:03] that's putting us in place amen but the
[1:25:06] National Force did Drive Israel to the
[1:25:08] Homeland the National Force of the
[1:25:11] Council of churches will drive every
[1:25:13] organization into it but the power let's
[1:25:16] say power but the power of God will
[1:25:19] raise the bride into Glory out of it
[1:25:21] amen I'm not worried about staying here
[1:25:24] I'm worried about getting out of it amen
[1:25:27] well whatever happens in the world you
[1:25:29] know I I get disheartened too I look at
[1:25:31] our governments and I think what in the
[1:25:33] world are they doing and then I get in
[1:25:36] the spirit and I realize what they're
[1:25:38] doing is creating chaos amongst
[1:25:40] themselves in order that we can go into
[1:25:43] rapture because if it doesn't
[1:25:47] it does it all Rapture amen this world
[1:25:49] has to fall apart amen the economy has
[1:25:53] to drop out so we can get an erupture
[1:25:57] and we wonder sometimes why are they
[1:26:00] doing this and that they're anointed to
[1:26:02] do what they're doing amen because
[1:26:04] they're being forced into it by evil
[1:26:06] power but we're being forced into the
[1:26:08] kingdom of God to drive us upward this
[1:26:12] pride is going up
[1:26:14] he said she went up
[1:26:17] not going down
[1:26:19] not people want to be Earthbound they
[1:26:21] can be Earthbound but I've been set free
[1:26:24] a long time ago I'm not about to be
[1:26:26] Earthbound anymore amen I'm praying
[1:26:29] Christ in this hour
[1:26:32] I may not preach like a Canadian and I'm
[1:26:34] happy that I don't
[1:26:36] I'll tell you brother Brown my brother
[1:26:38] brought it to my attention one time and
[1:26:40] he said said that that the Canadian
[1:26:43] people are starchy and he was really
[1:26:44] trying to drive a point at me and in a
[1:26:47] different country and
[1:26:48] and because he hadn't been to my church
[1:26:50] and he he so he I guess he was the
[1:26:52] bishop of my church too I I didn't know
[1:26:55] I had so many Bishops and and so he told
[1:26:58] me he he said that that all you
[1:27:01] Canadians are starchy
[1:27:03] I said well don't say that about me
[1:27:05] because you don't even know me
[1:27:07] I'll be honest with you I hope it's okay
[1:27:09] I'm going to say this you don't know me
[1:27:10] so we're getting to know each other
[1:27:12] uh brother Branham said it in Saskatoon
[1:27:16] that we were Moss packed
[1:27:18] I'll tell you what church I made a
[1:27:20] determination of my heart that was not
[1:27:23] going to be me it was not going to be my
[1:27:26] church it was not going to be anything
[1:27:28] to do with me and if that is the spirit
[1:27:31] I'm gonna fight and I'll fight it with
[1:27:33] all my heart until I've got nothing left
[1:27:36] in a fight I refuse to be bossed back I
[1:27:40] refuse to be dead I refuse for myself
[1:27:43] not to worship I refuse all of those
[1:27:46] things I am the son of the Living God
[1:27:49] I've got my right
[1:27:51] and we've got our right to worship we
[1:27:55] have our right to praise God Amen I
[1:27:58] lived in the church for many years you
[1:28:00] could hear the lights buzz I said that's
[1:28:02] not going to be my church amen do we if
[1:28:04] all we have is living lights what's that
[1:28:06] amen we live in people in the church
[1:28:09] people with determination people that
[1:28:12] say under the serve God with all my
[1:28:14] heart I'm not gonna give up or back down
[1:28:17] or move out under Eternal Living God
[1:28:21] Hallelujah foreign
[1:28:24] let's act like the brine
[1:28:27] if we're going up let's think we're
[1:28:29] going on
[1:28:30] amen we gotta show
[1:28:34] our neighbors got to see it in our lives
[1:28:36] the people got to see it in our lives
[1:28:39] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:42] amen we're a living bride we're Mrs
[1:28:44] Jesus Christ we heard this morning amen
[1:28:47] that and if we're misses Jesus Christ
[1:28:49] let's conduct yourself like Mrs Jesus
[1:28:51] Christ
[1:28:55] Hallelujah
[1:29:00] we're part of him
[1:29:02] if we're part of him then we got to be
[1:29:04] like him
[1:29:06] and we are like him
[1:29:13] I determined a long time ago it wasn't
[1:29:15] going to be me
[1:29:17] before he even brought up that quote
[1:29:20] I thought that was the past I thought
[1:29:22] man that's 60 60 some years ago
[1:29:26] I said we come up the road a long way
[1:29:29] from that time
[1:29:31] would I say that we're privileged to
[1:29:32] live in the hour that we're living in
[1:29:34] today
[1:29:35] we're living at the time of the coming
[1:29:37] of the Lord
[1:29:39] so if we're living at that time and we
[1:29:41] know the changing of our mortal bodies
[1:29:42] is just around the corner
[1:29:44] where we're going to go from mortality
[1:29:46] to immortality
[1:29:48] brother Brown said that's the ending of
[1:29:49] time and the blending of Eternity
[1:29:52] amen so what a great what a grand time
[1:29:54] we get to live in of all the times that
[1:29:56] could be chosen for any person God saved
[1:29:59] you for the last for this time because
[1:30:01] he knew that you would that that you
[1:30:03] were favored and he knew that you would
[1:30:05] accept his word in this hour
[1:30:07] amen and so we can say today we have
[1:30:11] received a Vindicated message
[1:30:13] amen from God we're living the age of
[1:30:15] the restoration I say the word of God
[1:30:17] has been restored to the people parts of
[1:30:20] it are becoming more enlightened as we
[1:30:22] continue on our journey because we need
[1:30:25] it in this hour of the journey amen the
[1:30:28] loose answers were left through the six
[1:30:30] Church ages have been all tied back to
[1:30:33] the word which is Christ
[1:30:34] amen and software tied back to the word
[1:30:37] then we know who we are we no longer
[1:30:40] look into a glass Darkly but we can see
[1:30:42] him now face to face and we see him that
[1:30:45] we see a reflection back and I
[1:30:47] appreciate that brother Sean with that
[1:30:48] mirror we see a reflection that that's
[1:30:51] me in the mirror in other words I'm part
[1:30:54] of him and he's part of me and we're
[1:30:56] reflecting back because he's the word
[1:30:59] and we're the word and we're reflecting
[1:31:01] back to him the word in this hour amen
[1:31:04] and that's not a word that's a
[1:31:06] denominational word or a charismatic
[1:31:08] word or something from a former age but
[1:31:11] it's something that's fresh meat to the
[1:31:13] Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour
[1:31:15] something that we hold on to something
[1:31:18] that we chew into something that changes
[1:31:22] ourselves
[1:31:23] into the image that he would have us to
[1:31:26] be
[1:31:27] and he's doing it
[1:31:29] I say this if I would have tried to I
[1:31:32] would have given up on myself a long
[1:31:33] time ago but I'm glad he don't give up
[1:31:35] on me
[1:31:36] amen there's something that's so
[1:31:38] beautiful to me is he in the Philippians
[1:31:40] one chapters of chapter one verse six he
[1:31:42] said he which begun a good work in me
[1:31:45] will conclude it he'll complete it amen
[1:31:47] so it's not my work it's his work amen
[1:31:50] when we start to think that it's me no
[1:31:52] it's not you it's Christ in you because
[1:31:54] he favored you therefore he gave you of
[1:31:57] his Spirit he gave you the word he gave
[1:32:00] that seed inside of your heart
[1:32:03] you become part of him
[1:32:06] he's part of you
[1:32:08] how could he forsake you
[1:32:11] could never forsake you
[1:32:14] so on this in this hour the Bride of
[1:32:16] Jesus Christ comes into full reality of
[1:32:19] who she is
[1:32:21] she has accepted the headship of the
[1:32:22] word
[1:32:24] I'll say that one more time she has
[1:32:26] accepted the headship of the word
[1:32:28] because that's the part that the other
[1:32:30] ages left out they didn't want us as he
[1:32:33] kept God kept moving forward they would
[1:32:35] not accept the headship of the word but
[1:32:38] you have accepted the headship of the
[1:32:40] word amen and it's a good word it's a
[1:32:43] good land and we're happy to be in this
[1:32:45] land
[1:32:48] and the bride realizes that she will be
[1:32:50] an invincible Army it's not she might be
[1:32:53] an invincible Army but she is an
[1:32:56] invisible Army let's say I'm invincible
[1:32:59] you are an invincible Army and it's not
[1:33:02] because of your sword but it's because
[1:33:04] his sword
[1:33:08] it's not your word it's his word
[1:33:11] and if it's his work then let's use that
[1:33:14] word
[1:33:15] there we go
[1:33:18] and because that you are an invincible
[1:33:21] Army you've been given the ability to
[1:33:24] spiritually discern the two Spirits
[1:33:26] under the framework of the Christian
[1:33:28] church
[1:33:29] that's important because in this hour's
[1:33:31] Lord deception
[1:33:33] there's a lot of spirits that are
[1:33:35] deceptive so I said this Olive that we
[1:33:38] need that in our lives in order that we
[1:33:40] realize Who We Are
[1:33:43] the word Invincible in the dictionary
[1:33:46] means incapable of being conquered
[1:33:51] can't be conquered
[1:33:53] it goes on it says you can't be overcome
[1:33:55] or subdued
[1:33:57] so if you can't be overcome or sir dude
[1:33:59] then you could say well I'm a child of
[1:34:01] the king amen God has been my favor
[1:34:04] amen I'm gonna go out every single day
[1:34:07] and I'm gonna walk the walk and talk the
[1:34:10] talk of this word
[1:34:12] because I'm incapable of being conquered
[1:34:15] you're incapable of being conquered
[1:34:18] and capable means it's impossible to say
[1:34:22] impossible
[1:34:23] I say with passion impossible
[1:34:26] impossible to be conquered
[1:34:29] oh that makes me feel good when I think
[1:34:32] about it hey man when I know that God's
[1:34:34] on my side amen that's him that's
[1:34:36] fighting my battles for me I just stand
[1:34:39] in the spot and he fights it for me
[1:34:42] it's not me it's not you but it's him
[1:34:46] that's why we're interested in here
[1:34:48] we're entrusted in Christ who's the word
[1:34:51] not a fake we love our imagination but
[1:34:54] the word
[1:34:56] let's say the word
[1:34:58] which is Christ which is you
[1:35:01] we're part of that word
[1:35:05] somebody say praise the Lord
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:10] when Satan came to tempt
[1:35:13] our Lord in Matthew chapter 4.
[1:35:16] Jesus didn't use any Supernatural power
[1:35:20] to resist him
[1:35:22] he only used the father's word
[1:35:25] if it wasn't the word it would have done
[1:35:27] had no effect upon Satan
[1:35:30] if Jesus would have actually fallen into
[1:35:32] the tribe
[1:35:34] but he didn't use anything Supernatural
[1:35:36] he only used his word
[1:35:38] so we know the fortification comes from
[1:35:41] the word
[1:35:43] you want to be fortified stay underneath
[1:35:46] in in behind the word
[1:35:48] you step out of the word you'll be in no
[1:35:51] match for the devil that's why there's
[1:35:53] no do's and don'ts in this message
[1:35:54] that's why there's no legalism in this
[1:35:57] message amen because if we want to stay
[1:35:59] fortified we stay in the word the word
[1:36:03] becomes our fortification it becomes
[1:36:05] what protects us from The Wiles of the
[1:36:08] enemy
[1:36:09] but if you step out into an Internet
[1:36:11] site you got better pull yourself back
[1:36:14] you step out in a certain area you're
[1:36:17] going to pull yourself back where are
[1:36:19] you going to pull back to you're going
[1:36:20] to pull it back to the word amen because
[1:36:23] the word becomes our fortification
[1:36:26] it has to be the word
[1:36:29] nothing else will do not adding to it or
[1:36:32] taken away from it or putting things in
[1:36:35] here amen and making it's got to be the
[1:36:39] word
[1:36:41] second Timothy 11 13-15 says for such
[1:36:46] our false apostles see for workers
[1:36:48] transforming themselves into the
[1:36:49] Apostles of Christ and it says no wonder
[1:36:52] or no Marvel Satan himself is
[1:36:54] transformed into an angel of Light their
[1:36:57] first no great thing if his Ministers of
[1:36:59] righteousness whose Aunt shall be
[1:37:00] according to their Works amen so Satan
[1:37:04] comes as a message preacher
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:09] he can quote the word but there's always
[1:37:12] going to be places where there's going
[1:37:14] to be problems within it
[1:37:16] amen I find sometimes you hear people
[1:37:19] they say things and excuse me for a
[1:37:21] moment here I I was I was saying Lord
[1:37:23] help me Jesus
[1:37:25] but I'll say this when people say should
[1:37:27] we stay home and listen to tapes or go
[1:37:29] to church that's not even some you
[1:37:31] should be even considered
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:36] you say what's up brother Kelly because
[1:37:39] our brother Paul told us in the
[1:37:42] in the Bible that God placed the
[1:37:45] prideful Ministry in the church he told
[1:37:48] us in the Bible gather yourself together
[1:37:50] that much more as you see that day
[1:37:52] approaching and people are sitting at
[1:37:55] home
[1:37:56] just maybe give me a little bit more
[1:37:58] and then they don't know they should be
[1:38:01] in church and I find such a confusion
[1:38:03] among certain people and they're saying
[1:38:05] should I be a church or or should I be
[1:38:07] listening to somebody tell me to push
[1:38:09] play I say it like this keep pushing
[1:38:12] play but come to the house of God let
[1:38:15] the world know what side you're on
[1:38:19] what's wrong with the people hey but
[1:38:22] they won't take the Bible anymore and
[1:38:24] believe the word of almighty God
[1:38:26] [Applause]
[1:38:29] it's a disgrace
[1:38:31] to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to the
[1:38:34] to the Vindicated message on the hour
[1:38:36] for a brother how to preach anything
[1:38:38] outside of what was in their scripture
[1:38:40] it would not be accounted for
[1:38:48] let me back it up
[1:38:50] Chicago Ministerial Association
[1:38:53] then that same group of men sent a lady
[1:38:55] down said brother brown but the angel of
[1:38:58] the Lord told you he said the angel of
[1:39:00] the Lord you know his picture is there
[1:39:02] you see that the angel of the Lord told
[1:39:05] you that well we'll believe it I said
[1:39:08] anybody that a mysterial group that
[1:39:10] would be that weak
[1:39:12] if the angel of the Lord said
[1:39:15] say I'm awake
[1:39:18] well we got about 40 percent a week I
[1:39:21] hope we got six here seventy percent at
[1:39:23] least a week
[1:39:26] good to see you this morning God bless
[1:39:28] you
[1:39:29] he said if the angel said something
[1:39:31] contrary to the word it wouldn't be the
[1:39:34] angel of the Lord
[1:39:36] so I don't care if they call themselves
[1:39:38] a prophet I don't care if they call
[1:39:40] himself teacher I don't care what name
[1:39:43] they put on their self if it's not
[1:39:46] according to the word I don't accept it
[1:39:54] how can we go so far down when we won't
[1:39:57] ever take the word anymore we'll take
[1:39:59] somebody else's thought that's no
[1:40:01] different than their denominational
[1:40:03] world and if you had her take away from
[1:40:05] this prophecy your pie will be taken
[1:40:08] away from the kingdom of God
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:12] Hallelujah
[1:40:18] brother Abraham goes further the angel
[1:40:20] of the Lord will vindicate the word
[1:40:22] that's exactly what he's always done
[1:40:24] through every age he still does the same
[1:40:27] thing he stays with the word
[1:40:31] and any minister
[1:40:34] Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:37] will stay by the same word
[1:40:40] because the Bible said the entire Bible
[1:40:43] was wrote by the Holy Ghost and how can
[1:40:45] you have the Holy Ghost and deny what
[1:40:48] the Bible says the very spirit in you it
[1:40:52] Bears record that it's not from God
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:40:57] that's a powerful word
[1:41:00] so if that's what the word is then if
[1:41:02] we're in the word we're fortified by the
[1:41:03] word and we're the bride that's rising
[1:41:06] up amen we're going to say in the word
[1:41:08] for not to be in the word puts herself
[1:41:11] outside of the word
[1:41:13] it's not the spirit of the Living God in
[1:41:15] us and it's another spirit and there's
[1:41:17] only one other Spirit that's the spirit
[1:41:19] of the devil
[1:41:21] I know people don't want to hear that
[1:41:23] they think because they got will you
[1:41:25] Branham on their back or they got some
[1:41:27] batch on their shirt that makes him a
[1:41:29] Christian that don't make you no
[1:41:31] Christian you need to be born again by
[1:41:34] the spirit of almighty God
[1:41:37] you can't even call Jesus of Christ
[1:41:40] without the Holy Ghost
[1:41:43] you're just mentioning words
[1:41:46] we've got to come back to the foundation
[1:41:49] of this message into the foundation of
[1:41:51] the Bible
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:53] oh it's sinking sound
[1:41:59] Hallelujah
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:08] got one more
[1:42:11] two's confirmation
[1:42:14] if the angel of the Lord told me
[1:42:15] something that wasn't in the Bible it
[1:42:17] wouldn't be the angel of the Lord
[1:42:19] that's right
[1:42:21] he never one time have told me anything
[1:42:23] but what was in the word
[1:42:26] so if the angel only told him what was
[1:42:27] in the word then we're interested in
[1:42:29] what the angel has to say
[1:42:31] has to be in the word
[1:42:33] without that
[1:42:35] sinking sound
[1:42:38] that's why people can be in a message
[1:42:40] church for 40 or 50 years and all of a
[1:42:42] sudden see what in the world happened to
[1:42:43] that guy
[1:42:45] amen they weren't in the word
[1:42:48] because if they would have studied it in
[1:42:49] the word they would have known what the
[1:42:51] word says
[1:42:52] amen but they were enticed by enticing
[1:42:54] spirits
[1:42:57] because Satan transforms himself like an
[1:42:59] angel of Light
[1:43:00] just like his ministers do
[1:43:03] hope that's okay
[1:43:05] amen I can preach this this morning I've
[1:43:07] been around in this message all my life
[1:43:09] I was in the I was six years five years
[1:43:12] old when I when my dad first gave his
[1:43:14] heart to the Lord in 1966 all I know is
[1:43:16] this message
[1:43:18] amen I've seen the ups and the Downs
[1:43:20] I've seen the splits three of them in
[1:43:21] their own church I've seen a lot of
[1:43:23] things happen over the years and I've
[1:43:25] seen a lot of carnality of men amen but
[1:43:28] I I want to say this this morning when
[1:43:30] you come back to the word that's where
[1:43:32] you get your stability from that's where
[1:43:35] you get your wholeness from that's where
[1:43:37] you get your faith from that's where you
[1:43:39] get what you have need of and there's
[1:43:41] hours from it's from the word of
[1:43:43] almighty God I'll say it one more time
[1:43:45] honor that interested in any man what
[1:43:47] they have to say if it's not in the word
[1:43:49] of God but if it's in the word of God I
[1:43:53] know it's coming from the angel
[1:43:56] because he'll only bring the word to the
[1:43:58] people
[1:44:01] well if it's okay brother Wendell
[1:44:03] I don't know if you'll invite me back
[1:44:05] again but I'm going to preach with all I
[1:44:07] got anyhow
[1:44:09] all I know is what's in this word of God
[1:44:12] I love it with all my heart
[1:44:14] have to be honest I'm passionate about
[1:44:16] it
[1:44:17] amen
[1:44:18] I think we need to be passionate about
[1:44:20] it
[1:44:21] in the hour that we're living in
[1:44:24] I have something to be passionate about
[1:44:27] you have something to be passionate
[1:44:29] about
[1:44:31] it's got to be the word
[1:44:33] you can feel good one day and feel not
[1:44:35] feel good the other day
[1:44:37] but that shouldn't that shouldn't affect
[1:44:39] your salvation
[1:44:42] I've been dealing with a scripture back
[1:44:44] home in Romans 15.
[1:44:46] and when you look at it through another
[1:44:47] translation it says that we should have
[1:44:49] uncontainable uncontainable joy
[1:44:52] and that uncontainable Joy is it because
[1:44:54] you're feeling good every day
[1:44:56] but in your soul realm there's something
[1:44:58] that that's uncontainable when you
[1:45:00] realize that you are once a sinner
[1:45:03] and you got saved by grace of almighty
[1:45:05] God and he took drugs out of your life
[1:45:07] and he took alcohol out of your life and
[1:45:10] he took cigarettes out of your life he
[1:45:12] took a moral living out of your life you
[1:45:14] got something to be happy
[1:45:16] hey man you
[1:45:18] man you the edible Joy not because I
[1:45:21] feel good but because of what Christ has
[1:45:23] done in this hour Hallelujah
[1:45:28] it's price
[1:45:30] he's the one that's done it
[1:45:33] why because you're favored
[1:45:36] and if you're favored you should accept
[1:45:38] it glorify God in it
[1:45:40] people sit in church oh I'm praising the
[1:45:43] Lord and I said I don't know nobody
[1:45:44] knows you're praising them
[1:45:47] we're not doing have no mental telepathy
[1:45:49] in here
[1:45:50] so we're not reading your minds
[1:45:53] they sit there like a bump on a pickle
[1:45:55] as brother Brown said I know who can't
[1:45:56] move around at all or thank the Lord
[1:45:59] amen
[1:46:01] you say brother Kelly if you only know
[1:46:02] what what's happened this last week well
[1:46:05] are you here
[1:46:06] has Christ been good to you
[1:46:10] has he been with you through the week
[1:46:13] then you got something to Rejoice about
[1:46:16] Hallelujah
[1:46:18] [Applause]
[1:46:24] we need to have Liberty
[1:46:27] it's like brother Brown
[1:46:30] I'm not even I don't know where we're
[1:46:31] going to go this morning
[1:46:34] we're gonna go wherever we're going to
[1:46:35] go
[1:46:38] brother Brown's sitting on his chair and
[1:46:40] those people started cutting it up on
[1:46:42] this front row there
[1:46:43] got out there wash pounds and stuff
[1:46:45] started dancing around he thought what
[1:46:47] in the world did I let my church
[1:46:49] that's what he said
[1:46:51] I'm glad it's on tape
[1:46:55] maybe I've looked at her for a while but
[1:46:57] it's still there
[1:46:58] it's on tape
[1:47:00] everybody says you got to be on tape
[1:47:02] it's on tape
[1:47:04] and and so just go to go back and push
[1:47:07] play and you'll find it on the tape
[1:47:08] [Applause]
[1:47:13] and and he said he was critical
[1:47:16] and the Holy Spirit started speaking to
[1:47:18] him he said well you just don't got as
[1:47:20] much Victory as they got
[1:47:24] if you were the man sitting at the gate
[1:47:25] called beautiful and G and Peter and
[1:47:27] John they walk by your way
[1:47:30] and you never walked in your life before
[1:47:33] and they said silver gold Have I None
[1:47:35] but such as I have I give unto you and
[1:47:37] he pulls them by the hand and man's
[1:47:39] never walk gets on his feet he would
[1:47:41] have just be all you know what this
[1:47:42] feels so good to be walking I you know
[1:47:45] what I just saw the Lord done something
[1:47:47] for me no you would be jumping just like
[1:47:49] he was jumping amen and when you know
[1:47:52] what Christ has done for you it'll do
[1:47:54] something foreign
[1:47:56] [Applause]
[1:48:03] thank you for his goodness
[1:48:06] it's uncontainable Joy what he's done
[1:48:09] for us
[1:48:12] he will say you're working up the people
[1:48:14] no the words working on them
[1:48:17] it's a word that's in
[1:48:20] the crowd has done for hope they got
[1:48:23] something to thank him for
[1:48:26] this bride is moving up
[1:48:28] do you know the Bible says that he
[1:48:30] rejoices with us and we rejoice in him
[1:48:34] he loves the joy of his people
[1:48:37] amen
[1:48:41] if I came home every day my wife wasn't
[1:48:43] was Sour every day my goodness he
[1:48:45] wouldn't want to go home
[1:48:48] that's for free
[1:48:52] so I did my notes brother Wendell didn't
[1:48:54] tell me to say it so
[1:48:58] you wouldn't want to go home
[1:49:01] why would he want to come in our midst
[1:49:03] if we said sourdough
[1:49:05] stopping back the holy spirit for moving
[1:49:08] and blessing somebody
[1:49:09] when our very attitudes can actually
[1:49:11] hinder the moving of the spirit of the
[1:49:13] Living God
[1:49:14] I know who that's for this morning but I
[1:49:16] I believe that's fresh from the Lord we
[1:49:19] need to get ourselves back into the line
[1:49:21] of the word of almighty God let him come
[1:49:24] on the scene and put a rejoicing within
[1:49:26] our heart for great things as our God
[1:49:29] done in this hour
[1:49:33] Hallelujah
[1:49:35] [Applause]
[1:49:39] Glory
[1:49:42] how much time do I have this morning
[1:49:43] brother window
[1:49:49] my clock is turning
[1:49:55] this the spirit is not seven spirits but
[1:49:58] one
[1:50:00] a church age book He will always be the
[1:50:02] same and act the same
[1:50:05] and the Seven Messengers will have the
[1:50:06] same spirit and teach the same word
[1:50:09] and have the same power
[1:50:11] and if the church is a true church it
[1:50:13] will have the same very same spirit and
[1:50:15] word and acts of power that they had at
[1:50:18] Pentecost
[1:50:19] I I know but Canada is something that's
[1:50:22] a bad word but I don't know why it's a
[1:50:23] bad word
[1:50:25] by experience it will be a Pentecostal
[1:50:27] Church
[1:50:28] I don't know why people always get that
[1:50:30] mixed up with the denomination it got
[1:50:33] nothing to do with the denomination
[1:50:35] they only put a name on their Church
[1:50:37] hey man but he's talking about the true
[1:50:39] church The Living Church amen the bride
[1:50:42] church amen she's going to be the same
[1:50:44] as what the original church was and if
[1:50:47] we think we're getting it any other way
[1:50:48] then they got in we better go back and
[1:50:50] read the message again because we need
[1:50:52] an experience with almighty God you can
[1:50:55] say well I believe the message of the
[1:50:57] hour then let's see it manifest itself
[1:50:59] in your life
[1:51:00] if you believe the word of God
[1:51:03] shall through your life because that's a
[1:51:06] living God
[1:51:08] not some dead letter
[1:51:11] not something that's been interjected to
[1:51:13] make the people feel that although if I
[1:51:16] believe the message that means I got the
[1:51:17] Holy Ghost you'll know when you got the
[1:51:19] Holy Ghost because it'll change your
[1:51:21] life
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:24] it will change your life
[1:51:28] it has to be the true holy ghost in our
[1:51:30] life then you watch your life line up
[1:51:33] with the word
[1:51:35] oh oh he's picking on me again in church
[1:51:38] so you say Lord if I need this this
[1:51:40] morning then father I want what you have
[1:51:42] for me this morning amen because I'm in
[1:51:44] the True Church of the Living God Amen
[1:51:48] and this church is the Living God is a
[1:51:50] Pentecostal Church
[1:51:53] I know people don't like to hear it but
[1:51:54] I'm going to tell it to them again
[1:51:56] anyhow I know people will be streaming
[1:51:58] this someday and they'll think I'm a
[1:52:00] fanatic but that's okay I feel good the
[1:52:02] way I am right here hey man I know what
[1:52:04] Christ's done in my life you know what
[1:52:07] Christ's son in your life amen and it
[1:52:09] changes your very thoughts
[1:52:12] and brings your thoughts into subjection
[1:52:14] to the word of God
[1:52:17] you can't have your thoughts changed
[1:52:19] back to the back to the things of God
[1:52:22] unless you got the holy ghost in your
[1:52:23] life
[1:52:24] that's why people are just actors in
[1:52:26] this day they can act for 40 years and
[1:52:29] all of a sudden what happened to him
[1:52:31] no Holy Ghost
[1:52:35] oh they had it on their flesh but they
[1:52:37] certainly did not have it in their soul
[1:52:38] Realm
[1:52:46] if the church is the true church they'll
[1:52:48] have the same spirit and word and acts
[1:52:50] of power they had a Pentecost by
[1:52:51] experience it would be a Pentecostal
[1:52:53] church and there will be tongues and
[1:52:55] interpretation of prophecies and
[1:52:56] healings God will be in the midst of her
[1:52:59] and God will declare himself in the
[1:53:01] midst of her as he always has
[1:53:04] and that beautiful brother Brown says
[1:53:06] that as he always has
[1:53:08] Hallelujah and she will be unorganized
[1:53:13] in other words my headquarters is in
[1:53:15] heaven
[1:53:16] I know we all had quarters that's where
[1:53:18] my headquarters is Shorty's not here and
[1:53:21] he says three words here he says don't
[1:53:23] forget that
[1:53:25] yeah so it's something we need to keep
[1:53:26] in our minds
[1:53:28] kind of takes care of a lot of other
[1:53:29] things
[1:53:33] said here in first Thessalonians 1 5 for
[1:53:35] Our Gospel came not unto you in word
[1:53:37] only
[1:53:38] but in power in the Holy Ghost and much
[1:53:40] Assurance as you know what manner of men
[1:53:42] we were among you for your sake
[1:53:43] amen so it's not in logos only for the
[1:53:46] letter kills but the spirit makes that
[1:53:48] letter come alive within our lives
[1:53:51] amen then it's no longer do's and don'ts
[1:53:54] it becomes your fortification
[1:53:57] amen
[1:53:58] and you willingly let's say willingly
[1:54:00] you willingly stand behind the word
[1:54:04] for you know the protection of it
[1:54:07] amen
[1:54:09] it's a protection of the word it keeps
[1:54:12] you protected
[1:54:13] I remember you a few years ago brother
[1:54:15] Wendell when he was back at our church I
[1:54:17] don't know if he remembers this or not
[1:54:18] he says he said if there's a Roaring
[1:54:20] River it has two Banks to him
[1:54:23] probably remember that
[1:54:25] but if you take the banks the way all
[1:54:27] you have is a stake and swamp
[1:54:31] a lot of people's lives are that way
[1:54:34] because they don't want nothing to keep
[1:54:36] them pulled them and tight here
[1:54:38] but if you have something that pulls it
[1:54:39] tight it's two Banks it allows the river
[1:54:41] to flows freely and when the river flows
[1:54:44] freely it puts all the junk out on the
[1:54:46] side
[1:54:48] amen everything that's not of God
[1:54:50] it moves out
[1:54:54] amen
[1:55:00] let's read this quote brother Jonathan
[1:55:02] things that are to be
[1:55:04] now then if it was hope you hope you're
[1:55:07] okay I I like to say in the message
[1:55:10] I like to keep in the message
[1:55:13] if Jesus was the fullness of God
[1:55:16] manifest he was the fullest of the
[1:55:17] godhead bodily therefore when he came to
[1:55:20] the Earth he was the manifested in flesh
[1:55:22] and was manifested in the flesh excuse
[1:55:24] me you were in him then because he was
[1:55:26] the word now I'm coming to us now here
[1:55:28] this morning and the beginning was the
[1:55:30] word and the Word was with God the Word
[1:55:32] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:55:34] doth Among Us the word was made flesh
[1:55:36] therefore you walked with him you were
[1:55:38] in him when he was on the earth you
[1:55:41] suffered with him and you died with him
[1:55:42] you was buried with him and now you are
[1:55:45] risen with him and manifested attributes
[1:55:48] of God setting in Heavenly places amen
[1:55:51] already raised resurrected to New Life
[1:55:53] and sitting in any places in Christ
[1:55:55] Jesus oh that means so much nowadays
[1:55:58] church that means so much to us to see
[1:56:00] ourselves positionally let's say
[1:56:02] positionally positionally placed in
[1:56:05] Jesus Christ now if we are those
[1:56:08] attributes of God and you watch how he
[1:56:10] says and now if we are those attributes
[1:56:13] of God we cannot live by creeds we can
[1:56:17] all live by denominationalism we must
[1:56:20] let's say we must let's say one more
[1:56:22] time we must we must live by the word
[1:56:26] because the pride is a part of the
[1:56:28] bridegroom like any wife is a part of
[1:56:31] her husband therefore we must be that
[1:56:33] word Bry and what is the word pride the
[1:56:36] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[1:56:41] a Creator denomination but a living
[1:56:44] Oracle let's say Oracle something that
[1:56:47] shines forth from something a living
[1:56:49] Oracle of God a living attribute of God
[1:56:53] display it to the World the attributes
[1:56:56] of God in the formation of the Bride
[1:56:58] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:57:01] we're now living and I say she is being
[1:57:04] expressed and she is here in this hour
[1:57:07] and we are living Oracles of God
[1:57:10] manifesting the word of God to this
[1:57:12] generation there won't be a lot of
[1:57:15] people be a few people oh amen but it
[1:57:17] will be a worldwide people
[1:57:20] living Oracles of God
[1:57:23] not dead articles
[1:57:26] of God something that's got some life in
[1:57:30] it
[1:57:31] something that's full of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:35] not afraid of the moving of the spirit
[1:57:39] I find the most some message places and
[1:57:42] that people are afraid of the moving of
[1:57:44] the spirit
[1:57:45] because they've never felt it
[1:57:49] [Applause]
[1:57:52] that's what makes them bind up
[1:57:54] they say what in the world is all this
[1:57:56] noise
[1:57:57] what in the world is happening in Pony
[1:57:59] Nation
[1:58:00] what in the world these people are out
[1:58:02] of their minds no they got their minds
[1:58:05] they got the mind of Christ in them
[1:58:06] they're accepted the headship of the
[1:58:09] word they realize they're the living
[1:58:11] bride they realize they're raising up
[1:58:14] [Applause]
[1:58:15] they realize who they are
[1:58:18] in the hour that we're living in
[1:58:22] Hallelujah
[1:58:27] brother Brown told us that there would
[1:58:28] be churches churches and Brides brides
[1:58:30] but there's going to church

[1:59:28] this has comes to our our thoughts and
[1:59:29] when we were predestinated that means
[1:59:32] that God saw us from before the
[1:59:33] foundation of the world not to where we
[1:59:35] are right here but he sees us already in
[1:59:37] the millennium
[1:59:39] we're just going through the Dark Room
[1:59:42] of time when we start to realize that we
[1:59:44] are the bride that we are the rapture

[2:03:13] until we get to that place what good
[2:03:15] does it do to fix up the car what good
[2:03:17] is it to polish it
[2:03:19] what good does it do to give it a face
[2:03:21] job or a facelift or simonizing job or
[2:03:24] there's no Dynamics in it no matter what
[2:03:26] no matter how much mechanics prove to be
[2:03:29] right there has ought to be a dynamic to
[2:03:31] make it work
[2:03:32] amen there's got to be something that

[2:03:54] before we're just realizing that he's
[2:03:57] here
[2:03:58] amen and I I say that we may not be able
[2:04:01] to see him physically with our eyes but
[2:04:02] we certainly can feel his presence I can
[2:04:05] certainly feel it up here this morning
[2:04:07] or the presence of the Lord amen if God
[2:04:10] is still here with us with brother Brown
[2:04:12] I mean it's not a problem here but it
[2:04:14] can be sometimes backward on that they
[2:04:16] think brother Brown has to come back to
[2:04:18] do this and brother but I'm about to
[2:04:19] come back to do that I look at her like
[2:04:22] this whenever I have need of is already
[2:04:23] on the tapes already in the word of God
[2:04:26] I better apply it to my life and when he
[2:04:29] does come back on the resurrection I'm
[2:04:31] not going to have to be taught and
[2:04:32] preached to and things like that we're
[2:04:34] going to be in a whole different
[2:04:36] dimension
[2:04:40] Hallelujah he's not bringing my new body
[2:04:44] Jesus has gone to prepare our new bodies
[2:04:48] [Applause]
[2:04:52] sometimes we get it out of kilter
[2:04:55] brother Ron says look at the carnal
[2:04:57] Church look where they're going further
[2:04:59] and further away look at their Spiritual
[2:05:01] Church shaking off all this little
[2:05:02] nonsense coming up in the spirit in the
[2:05:05] minority of course coming in the spirit
[2:05:07] but moving up to such a place until
[2:05:09] let's go up there to where the holy
[2:05:11] spirit will be right through it working
[2:05:13] its way ready to receive her Lord ready
[2:05:16] to receive her Lord
[2:05:17] amen I say the spiritual church is
[2:05:20] shaking off all this binding powers of
[2:05:24] formality and intellectualism
[2:05:26] and lukewarmness I would try to get
[2:05:28] amongst the people
[2:05:30] so let me catch my breath here for a
[2:05:31] while
[2:05:33] I'm not 27 anymore or 20 years old
[2:05:39] where's to shake all that all off
[2:05:42] lukewarmness

[2:13:55] of God's spoken word 56 he said when he
[2:13:57] come he come through a virgin
[2:13:59] God made his promise sure he stuck with
[2:14:01] his word every word of it had to be so
[2:14:03] he made it perfect because he was God
[2:14:05] and couldn't do nothing else he had to
[2:14:06] stay with it
[2:14:07] he said next the next thing he had to do
[2:14:10] the church had to be anointed and sent
[2:14:12] out before he could keep his promise
[2:14:15] he had to make a way for the church to
[2:14:17] be anointed and the church after Walking
[2:14:19] With Jesus anointing Jesus and had
[2:14:21] received power to heal second do
[2:14:23] everything and all these ups and downs
[2:14:25] and things that they'd had and yet
[2:14:27] walked with Jesus he know that he had to
[2:14:29] make a way to send his church out
[2:14:31] anointed
[2:14:33] the point is the anointing amen he sent
[2:14:37] them up to Jerusalem they went into the
[2:14:38] upper room and stayed there for 10 days
[2:14:40] and nights until suddenly there came a
[2:14:41] sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty
[2:14:43] Wind that filled all the house where
[2:14:45] they were sitting God made a way to
[2:14:47] anoint his church and to spread her
[2:14:49] across the ages across the Nations
[2:14:51] rather and today that same Mighty
[2:14:53] glorious church is marching on to Zion

[2:16:19] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[2:16:21] spirit of God raises up a standard
[2:16:23] against it and today what science is

[2:18:40] there's a song I think brother Isaiah
[2:18:42] Brooks used to sing and one day I'm
[2:18:43] going to take a step toward my theophany
[2:18:46] just around the corner
[2:18:48] anytime we're going to be there
[2:18:50] I believe that with all my heart
[2:18:52] could be by morning
[2:18:54] we don't know
[2:18:56] could be the last convention that Pawnee
[2:18:58] has
[2:19:01] we don't know but one day it will be the
[2:19:04] last one
[2:19:06] I'll be honest with you I'd rather meet
[2:19:08] you all in glory than to meet you back
[2:19:09] here in Pawnee again
[2:19:12] I'll be honest with that
[2:19:22] everything you need God has given to us
[2:19:25] when we go from these meetings we need
[2:19:27] to have it in our heart
[2:19:29] I am the bride
[2:19:31] I'm moving up
[2:19:33] I'm not moving backwards
[2:19:35] I'm not giving in I'm not giving out I'm
[2:19:37] moving up
[2:19:39] it don't matter what so-and-so says I'm
[2:19:41] just moving up
[2:19:43] well I'll go back to my church and think
[2:19:45] that I'm crazy just let them think what
[2:19:47] you let them think what they want
[2:19:49] and if they think that too long maybe
[2:19:52] you have to take his decision
[2:19:59] amen
[2:20:01] the church is going up
[2:20:05] they're not going to pull me down
[2:20:07] nope
[2:20:09] they can call me what they want they can
[2:20:11] do what they want
[2:20:12] they can say what they want
[2:20:14] but I got some Dynamics in my life to
[2:20:16] prove that this gospel works and it's
[2:20:18] real
[2:20:19] you got it in your heart
[2:20:22] and be in the groom and the bride has to
[2:20:24] come forth because it's part of him and
[2:20:26] it can be manifested of the fulfilling
[2:20:28] of all the revelations and that they
[2:20:29] spoke of the Bride it can only manifest
[2:20:31] if it does something different from the
[2:20:33] groom it isn't the bride because she is
[2:20:36] Flash of his flesh and bone of his bone
[2:20:38] and life of his life she has power of
[2:20:40] his power she is him that's who we are
[2:20:43] in this end time we are him
[2:20:45] no matter how much we can stand and
[2:20:47] prove the message to be right there has
[2:20:48] to be something that makes it go to work
[2:20:50] in our lives
[2:20:53] something has to make a go to work in
[2:20:55] our lives
[2:20:57] you need Dynamics and mechanics
[2:21:00] brother Branham said that if you had 100
[2:21:02] octane gas you'd still need a spark
[2:21:07] we had a situation happen just recently
[2:21:10] yeah brother Jonas has a little boat
[2:21:13] and he gassed up a certain gas station
[2:21:16] we took it to our to our Cottage to our
[2:21:18] Lake and and to put her in the water and
[2:21:20] worked all over and worked pretty good
[2:21:21] for a dangerous soul and also just quit
[2:21:24] and so we checked it and we thought well
[2:21:27] what in the world's wrong with this
[2:21:28] thing checked well it's got gas
[2:21:31] check the spark oh they were Spark
[2:21:34] checked everything we couldn't figure
[2:21:35] out what's wrong about a new fuel pump
[2:21:36] for it and we thought well maybe it
[2:21:38] doesn't have enough fuel pump not
[2:21:39] powering up enough
[2:21:40] and we checked that and nope that's all
[2:21:42] working so we took it to a tech
[2:21:44] sometimes good to take it to attack
[2:21:46] sometimes it's good to bring it back to
[2:21:48] the Bible
[2:21:49] see if it's right or not
[2:21:51] and so the tech went through it put his
[2:21:53] computers on it did everything had to do
[2:21:55] on it and everything's there and it's
[2:21:57] got the octane the powers there
[2:21:59] everything's there
[2:22:01] yeah and so then he tested the gas
[2:22:04] and he realized that there was no octane
[2:22:06] in the gas
[2:22:07] even though he had put it in right fresh
[2:22:09] from a pump
[2:22:11] there was so much water in the gas it
[2:22:12] wouldn't even fire
[2:22:14] amen and there's so many people that are
[2:22:16] deluding this word of God it's no wonder
[2:22:18] there is not firing anymore it's such a
[2:22:21] deluding of the power of God and there's
[2:22:23] no there's no arcade left in the gas we
[2:22:26] didn't get the octane back in the gas
[2:22:29] because if you got spark you need
[2:22:32] something of a combustion
[2:22:36] arcane
[2:22:41] the man pulled all the gas out of the
[2:22:43] out of the vehicle
[2:22:45] put in fresh gas fired up just like that
[2:22:48] it's no wonder some places aren't firing
[2:22:50] they're pumping
[2:22:52] there's no octane in the gas why they've
[2:22:55] deluded the Gospel of Jesus Christ they
[2:22:58] took praise under their Church they took
[2:23:00] worship out of their Church they took
[2:23:02] times out of the church they took the
[2:23:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the
[2:23:06] church
[2:23:08] and all they're left with is a form
[2:23:12] they've got something that should float
[2:23:14] something that should work but it don't
[2:23:16] work
[2:23:18] I say go back to your tank and pull out
[2:23:23] empty out
[2:23:25] get Christ back in the tank
[2:23:28] let Christ come in your heart
[2:23:31] fire every time
[2:23:34] it'll work every time
[2:23:37] Hallelujah
[2:23:39] I thought it was just a
[2:23:42] just something that was just happened to
[2:23:44] his vehicle
