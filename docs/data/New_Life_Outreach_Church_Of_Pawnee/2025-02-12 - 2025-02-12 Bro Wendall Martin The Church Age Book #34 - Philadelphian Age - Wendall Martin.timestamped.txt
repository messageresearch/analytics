[26:59] if we're needing uh books here this
[27:02] evening all right it says
[27:04] Philadelphia was 75 miles Southeast of
[27:09] Sardis it was the second largest city in
[27:12] Lydia it was built upon several Hills in
[27:16] a famous wine growing District its coins
[27:20] bore the head of buckas and the figure
[27:23] of a bante priestess of bakas
[27:28] the uh population of the city included
[27:31] Jews Christians of Jewish origin and
[27:35] converts from
[27:38] heathenism the city suffered frequently
[27:41] or or frequent earthquakes and yet its
[27:45] duration was the longest of the Seven
[27:47] Cities of
[27:48] Revelation in fact the city still exist
[27:52] under Turkish name of uh aleshire or the
[27:58] city of God the mage of the coins
[28:02] suggests the deity of the city to be
[28:04] bakas now bakas is the same as ninis or
[28:08] Nimrod he is the lamented one though
[28:11] most of us think of him in terms of rry
[28:14] and
[28:14] drunkenness what illumination this
[28:17] brings to our
[28:18] minds here is a coin with the God on one
[28:21] side and the Priestess or propheus on
[28:24] the other Now flip a coin does it matter
[28:28] which way it comes down no sir it is
[28:31] still the same coin that is the romanish
[28:34] religion of Jesus and Mary but we are
[28:37] not thinking of Rome only no there is
[28:41] not only the great
[28:43] Harlot certainly not for she by her
[28:46] fornication has become a mother her
[28:49] daughters now are coins of the same Mage
[28:52] they're on one side of the coin they
[28:54] have drawn up a worship of Jesus and on
[28:56] the other they have the Priestess or
[28:58] Prophet us also she writes her Creeds
[29:01] and dogmas and tenants and sells them to
[29:04] people for salvation insisting that she
[29:06] and she alone has the True Light how
[29:09] remarkable is the fact that this age is
[29:12] characterized by the coin for mother and
[29:15] daughters are all buying their way to
[29:17] heaven money and not blood is the
[29:20] purchase
[29:21] price money and not spirit is the power
[29:25] that moves them the God of this world
[29:28] World Mammon hath blinded their eyes but
[29:31] their dealings in death will ens soon
[29:34] for this is the age that the spirit
[29:36] cries behold I come quickly even so come
[29:39] quickly Lord Jesus the age Philadelphia
[29:43] Philadelphian age lasted from 1750 to
[29:48] 1906 this age due to the meaning of the
[29:51] name of the city has been called the age
[29:53] of Brotherly Love as Philadelphia means
[29:56] love of brother
[29:58] the messenger the messenger to this age
[30:01] was without doubt John Wesley John
[30:05] Wesley was born of Epworth June 17
[30:09] 1703 and was one of the 19 one of 19
[30:13] children born to Samuel and Susanna
[30:15] Wesley his father was a chaplain in the
[30:19] Church of England but it it is more than
[30:22] likely uh it is more than likely that
[30:26] the religious turn of John's mind was
[30:28] based more upon his mother's ex
[30:31] exemplary life than upon his father's
[30:34] theology John was a brilliant scholar it
[30:37] was while he was at Oxford that he and
[30:39] Charles become part of a group who were
[30:42] spiritually exercised to worship on the
[30:45] basis of experimentally living the truth
[30:48] rather than making Doctrine their their
[30:52] standard they drew up a spiritual guide
[30:55] of works such as giving to the poor
[30:58] visiting the sick and the
[31:00] imprisoned for this they were called
[31:03] methodists and other duress of NE titles
[31:07] now John was sufficiently uh imbued by
[31:10] his vision of the need of religion for
[31:12] the peoples of the world that he went to
[31:15] America Georgia as a missionary among
[31:19] the Indians on his way there he found
[31:22] that many of the ship's passengers were
[31:26] moravians he was deep deeply impressed
[31:28] by their meekness peace courage in all
[31:32] circumstances his labors in Georgia in
[31:35] spite of self-denials and hard work was
[31:37] a failure he returned to England crying
[31:40] I went to America to convert the Indians
[31:42] but oh who shall convert me but in
[31:46] London he again met with the moravians
[31:49] it was Peter bowler who showed him the
[31:52] way of Salvation he was truly Born Again
[31:56] much to the dismay and event anger of
[31:58] his brother Charles who could not
[32:01] understand how such a spiritual man as
[32:03] John should say he was not formerly
[32:06] right with God it was however not long
[32:09] after that Charles too was saved by
[32:13] grace Wesley now began to preach the
[32:16] gospel in those pull pits in London to
[32:18] which he formly had access but soon they
[32:21] turned him
[32:22] out it was at this time that his old
[32:25] friend George Whitfield
[32:28] told him in a in good stead uh for he in
[32:32] uh stood him in good stead for he
[32:35] invited John to come and help him preach
[32:37] in the fields where thousands were
[32:39] listening to the word Wesley at first
[32:42] was incredulous that he should preach in
[32:44] an open field instead of a building but
[32:47] when he saw the throngs and saw the
[32:49] working of the gospel and the power of
[32:51] the spirit he turned wholeheartedly to
[32:53] such preaching the work soon took on
[32:56] such proportions that he begin sending
[32:59] out numerous laymen to preach the
[33:02] word this seemed like a parallel to
[33:06] Pentecost where the spirit raised up men
[33:09] with power to preach and teach the word
[33:11] almost overnight there was violent
[33:14] opposition to his work but God was with
[33:16] him the workings of the spirit were
[33:19] mightily manifested and often such
[33:21] Spirit of conviction took hold of the
[33:24] people as to take away their strength
[33:27] and they would fall to the ground crying
[33:30] in great distress over their
[33:31] sins Wesley was a remarkably strong man
[33:35] he says of himself that he could not
[33:38] remember to have felt loness of spirits
[33:40] for even a quarter hour since he was
[33:43] born he slept no more than six hours a
[33:46] day arose in time to start preaching at
[33:49] 5: practically every morning of every
[33:52] day of his ministry preached up to four
[33:55] times on a single day
[33:58] so that in a year he would average over
[34:00] 800 sermons that is
[34:03] incredible he traveled multiple
[34:06] thousands of miles as he did as did his
[34:10] circuit Riders who carried the gospel
[34:12] near and far in fact Wesley traveled
[34:16] 4500 miles per year by
[34:19] horse he was a believer in the power of
[34:22] God and he prayed for the sick with
[34:24] great faith and wonderful results many
[34:27] of his meetings saw the manifestation of
[34:29] spiritual gifts Wesley was not in favor
[34:32] of
[34:33] organization his associates did have a
[34:35] society who were a company of men having
[34:38] the form and seeking the power of
[34:40] godliness United in order to pray
[34:43] together to receive the word of
[34:44] exhortation and to watch over one
[34:46] another in love that they may help each
[34:49] other to work out their
[34:51] salvation the only condition of those
[34:53] entering was that they should be one of
[34:56] those who had desire to flee from the
[34:57] Wrath to come and to be saved from their
[35:00] sins as time went on they worked out a
[35:03] strict set of rules to be used in
[35:06] self-discipline for the good of their
[35:08] souls Wesley recognized that after his
[35:11] death the movement would be organized
[35:14] and the spirit of God would leave them
[35:16] to dead form he once remarked that he
[35:19] did not fear that the name of Methodist
[35:21] would leave the Earth but that the
[35:23] spirit might take his
[35:25] flight during his lifetime
[35:28] he could have acquired vast wealth but
[35:31] he did not his favorite saying on the
[35:33] subject of money was get all you can
[35:36] save all you can and give all you can
[35:39] how strange it would be for Wesley to
[35:41] come back and see the denomination that
[35:43] bears the name of Methodist today
[35:45] they're rich vastly rich but the life
[35:48] and power of John Wesley is
[35:51] missing it should also be mentioned that
[35:53] Wesley never did desire to build a work
[35:56] upon denomination ational or sectarian
[35:59] basis though he was an Armenian in his
[36:02] beliefs he did not want to separate
[36:04] himself from Brethren on the grounds of
[36:06] Doctrine he was a good candidate for
[36:09] James he based his eternal life on faith
[36:11] and works or the or the living of the
[36:14] life rather than simply accepting a
[36:16] Creed or a doctrinal
[36:18] statement John died John Wesley died at
[36:21] the age of 88 having served God as few
[36:24] men would dare to even think they might
[36:28] re the S the
[36:30] salutation Revelations 3:7 unto the
[36:33] angel of the Church of Philadelphia
[36:36] write these things saith he that is Holy
[36:39] he that is true he that hath the Key of
[36:42] David he that openeth and no man
[36:44] shutteth and shutteth and no man
[36:46] openeth oh how beautiful are these words
[36:50] How
[36:51] Majestic even the sound of them how
[36:54] thrilling to think that all those
[36:56] attributes can be app to one person who
[36:59] would dare to say such things about
[37:01] himself but Jesus Christ the lord of
[37:04] Glory I believe the key to interpreting
[37:07] exactly what each of these wonderful
[37:09] descriptive phrases means is found in
[37:11] verse 9 behold I will make them of the
[37:14] synagogue of Satan which say that they
[37:16] are Jews and are not but do lie behold I
[37:19] will make them to come and worship
[37:22] before thy feet and to know that I have
[37:24] loved Thee I say this verse is the key
[37:27] because it deals with the Jews who have
[37:30] always called themselves the children of
[37:31] God to the exclusion of everyone else
[37:34] they crucified and killed the Lord Jesus
[37:37] Christ their terrible Deeds brought
[37:40] their own blood upon their own heads for
[37:43] centuries all because they refused Jesus
[37:46] as their Messiah which indeed he was to
[37:49] them he was not the coming one nor the
[37:51] son of David to them he was be elub or
[37:54] some unrighteous one fit only for
[37:56] Destruction
[37:58] but not so he was indeed
[38:01] Emmanuel God manifest In the Flesh he is
[38:04] indeed
[38:05] Messiah surely he was exactly as he now
[38:09] sets himself forth to be there he is the
[38:12] same Jesus Jesus Christ the same
[38:15] yesterday today and forever that Holy
[38:19] One in the midst of the lamp stands is
[38:21] the very same Jesus who walked the
[38:23] shores of Galilee who healed the sick
[38:25] who raised the Dead who in spite of
[38:28] irrefutable proof was crucified and
[38:30] killed but he arose again and is seated
[38:34] at the right hand of the Majesty on high
[38:37] the Jews did not call him holy then they
[38:40] do not call him holy now but he is the
[38:43] Holy One psalm 16:10 for thou will not
[38:47] leave my soul in Hell neither will thou
[38:50] suffer thine Holy One to see
[38:54] corruption they sought their
[38:55] righteousness after the law and and
[38:57] failed miserably for by the law can no
[39:01] flesh be justified by the law can no man
[39:04] be made holy Holiness is of the Lord 1
[39:08] Corinthians 1:30 but of him are ye in
[39:11] Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us
[39:15] wisdom righteousness
[39:17] sanctification and Redemption 2
[39:20] Corinthians
[39:22] 521b that we might be made the
[39:25] righteousness of God in him
[39:28] it was Christ or perish and they
[39:31] perished for they refused him and the
[39:34] men of that age even as today were
[39:37] making the same mistake as the Jews took
[39:40] refuge in the synagogue form of worship
[39:44] so in the Philadelphian age they were
[39:47] taking refuge in the church it is not
[39:50] joining a church that counts the life
[39:53] isn't is not in a church the life is in
[39:56] Christ
[39:58] this is the record that God hath given
[40:00] to us eternal life and this life is in
[40:03] his
[40:04] son he that hath the son hath life he
[40:08] that hath not the son hath not life man
[40:11] is made Holy by the spirit it is the
[40:16] spirit of Holiness that raised up uh
[40:19] that raised Jesus from the dead that
[40:21] indwells us and makes us holy with his
[40:25] Holiness there he stands stands the Holy
[40:28] One and we will stand with him clothed
[40:32] in his righteousness holy with his
[40:34] Holiness now this age is the sixth age
[40:37] in the eyes of God time is drawing to a
[40:40] close he will soon be coming back and
[40:43] the soon the cry will come forth as he
[40:45] comes and he which is filthy let him be
[40:48] filthy still and he that is righteous
[40:50] let him be righteous still he that is
[40:53] Holy let him be holy still Revelations
[40:56] 2211 me oh I'm so glad that my Holiness
[41:00] is not of
[41:01] myself I am glad that I'm in Christ with
[41:04] all his wonderful attributes of
[41:06] righteousness imputed yay imparted unto
[41:10] me blessed be God
[41:13] forever these things saith he that is
[41:16] true now this word true is a very
[41:19] wonderful word it does not mean true in
[41:22] the sense that it is opposite to false
[41:25] it expresses the perfect realization of
[41:28] an idea as contrasted with its per uh
[41:31] partial
[41:33] realization for example we recall that
[41:36] Jesus said in John
[41:38] 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread from
[41:42] heaven but my father giveth you the true
[41:46] bread from Heaven John 15 And1 I am the
[41:50] True Vine Hebrews
[41:52] 9:24 for Christ has not entered into the
[41:55] holy places made with hand
[41:57] which are the figure of the true but
[42:00] into heaven itself now to appear in the
[42:03] presence of God for US 1 John 2 and8
[42:06] because the darkness is passed and the
[42:08] True Light now
[42:11] shines since this word indeed expresses
[42:14] perfect realization as against the idea
[42:17] of partial realization as Illustrated in
[42:20] these verses we can Now understand as
[42:23] never before anti-type contrasted with
[42:27] type and substance with Shadow take
[42:31] example now of the Mana from Heaven God
[42:35] sent down Angel bread from heaven for
[42:37] Israel but that bread did not satisfy it
[42:41] was only good for a day those who ate it
[42:43] were hungry again the next day if it was
[42:46] left around it become contaminated but
[42:49] Jesus is the true bread from
[42:52] heaven where of Mana was just a type and
[42:56] if any man eats of that bread that came
[42:59] from Heaven uh he will never hunger
[43:03] again he does not need to come back and
[43:06] eat again the moment he partook he had
[43:08] eternal life here indeed was reality no
[43:12] need any longer for a shadow no need for
[43:16] a partial salvation here is the whole of
[43:19] it Gees just like Jesus isn't a part of
[43:22] God he is
[43:25] God no one can deny that Israel had
[43:28] light they were the only people who had
[43:31] light as a nation as it
[43:35] was it was uh when Egypt was so dark
[43:38] that one could feel it but in the homes
[43:41] of the Israelites there was light but
[43:44] now True light has come the light of the
[43:46] world is Jesus Moses and the prophets
[43:50] brought the light by means of the
[43:52] scripture relative to the Messiah thus
[43:55] Israel had light but now the Fulfillment
[43:58] of the light has come what was but
[44:01] glowing word has now broken forth into
[44:05] the brightness of God manifested among
[44:07] his people and as the pillar of fire
[44:10] gave light at night that was wonderful
[44:13] now light and life were manifested in
[44:16] the fullness of the godhead bodily that
[44:19] just makes me want to shout
[44:21] hallelujah Jesus used to take the red or
[44:24] the Israel used to take the red heer and
[44:27] and sacrifice her upon the Altar for the
[44:29] remission of sins for a year the sins of
[44:33] the guilty one was covered but that
[44:36] covering couldn't take away this desire
[44:39] for sin it was not a perfect offering it
[44:43] was a shadow until the real come along
[44:46] so each year the man would sacrifice and
[44:49] each year come back because he still had
[44:51] the same desire to sin the life of the
[44:55] animal atoned for his sin
[44:57] but being animal blood that was shed and
[45:00] animal life that was given it could not
[45:03] come back upon the
[45:05] man if it had come back it still would
[45:08] not have availed but when Christ the
[45:11] perfect substitute was given and his
[45:14] blood was shed then the life that was in
[45:18] Christ came back upon the repentant
[45:21] Sinner and the life being the perfect
[45:24] life of Christ sinless and righteous
[45:28] then the guilty one could go free for he
[45:31] had no desire to sin the life of Jesus
[45:35] had come back upon him that is what is
[45:38] meant in Romans 8 and2 the law of the
[45:43] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made
[45:46] me free from the law of sin and death
[45:50] but the Jews back there in the time of
[45:52] Jesus did not want to accept that
[45:55] sacrifice the blood of bulls and
[45:58] goats made nothing perfect it was once
[46:01] God's ordained method but now Christ had
[46:04] appeared in the flesh and by the
[46:06] shedding of his own blood has put away
[46:08] sin and by that offering of himself has
[46:11] made us perfect the Jews did not take
[46:15] that but what about the Philadelphian
[46:17] age and yes the other ages
[46:20] too did they really accept this reality
[46:24] in Christ no sir
[46:27] even though Luther brought the truth of
[46:31] justification the Roman the Roman Church
[46:34] and its eastern counterpart the Orthodox
[46:36] Church still clung to works now works
[46:40] are fine but they don't save you you
[46:44] don't they don't make you perfect it is
[46:47] Christ or perish it is not even Christ
[46:51] and works it is Christ
[46:54] Alone this age began the years of Armen
[46:58] arminianism that does not believe in
[47:01] Christ as the reality it does not sing
[47:04] of nothing but the blood for it sings of
[47:08] nothing but the blood and my own conduct
[47:11] now I believe in Good Conduct if you are
[47:14] saved you will do righteously you are
[47:16] all we've already gone over that but let
[47:19] me tell you now salvation is not Jesus
[47:23] plus it is Jesus alone salvation
[47:27] is of the Lord from the start to finish
[47:30] it is all God let his life be in me let
[47:36] his blood cleanse me let his spirit that
[47:39] fills me let it be his word in my heart
[47:42] and mouth let it be his stripes that
[47:45] heals me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone
[47:50] not by works of righteousness which I
[47:51] have done no sir Christ is my life and
[47:56] can we all say amen amen Christ is my
[48:00] life now now I want to I I want to uh
[48:04] stop here for a minute because now it's
[48:06] easy for us to look it's it is it's easy
[48:10] for us to look at the Catholic Church as
[48:13] as work oriented and that you have to do
[48:15] you know uh count so many beads you have
[48:17] to go through uh you have to pay so much
[48:20] to get out of purgatory you have to do a
[48:22] lot of these things that that are there
[48:24] but but brother bradam would say amen he
[48:27] he he would and he would he would talk
[48:29] about you says but what about this
[48:31] Philadelphian age and the and the other
[48:33] ages and this at the first of the uh 294
[48:36] he says did they really accept the
[48:38] reality in Christ and he says no sir
[48:41] even though Luther brought
[48:43] justification the Roman Church and his
[48:45] counterpart the Orthodox Church still
[48:47] clung to works now and and and I I want
[48:52] to clarify because there is there is
[48:56] nothing
[48:57] that that any of us can do again to ever
[49:03] inherit eternal life Jesus and Jesus
[49:07] alone has eternal life there's no good
[49:11] works that any of us can do to inherit
[49:15] it now but on the other hand now brother
[49:19] brandham has talked on throughout the
[49:21] the church age book that everyone is
[49:24] that that the that the denomination
[49:26] ational churches are are are are uh work
[49:31] related they're they're they're um uh
[49:34] they are they are basing their salvation
[49:37] upon their works now it's easy for us to
[49:40] look and say well they cut their hair
[49:44] they they they they the ladies wear
[49:48] pants uh these days guys are getting
[49:51] more feminist and we're saying Works
[49:54] see works works related is
[49:58] anything and a trusting putting our
[50:01] trust in anything outside of Christ and
[50:05] his word so so to some um Works some is
[50:11] well you give them the scripture and you
[50:13] say but now the scripture says and
[50:15] they'll say listen I I witness I'm a
[50:20] preacher I'm a
[50:22] singer I I work for the Lord so to them
[50:25] that's eternal life to them they're
[50:28] going to be accepted by God I I give to
[50:32] the poor I do this these these are all
[50:35] to them works now and we can be the same
[50:39] way in in our in in in in this church
[50:43] right here tonight and say I wear long
[50:46] hair I I I have I have uh uh long
[50:50] flowing dresses as men can say I'm not
[50:52] cheating on my wife I'm not doing these
[50:54] kinds of things and so I am right with
[50:57] God there's only one way that you're
[50:59] right with God and that you possess
[51:01] eternal life and that is the spirit of
[51:06] life that made Jesus perfect made that
[51:09] body perfect lives in you so the spirit
[51:14] of God that lived in that body that made
[51:18] Jesus the perfect
[51:20] sacrifice amen so that he would forgive
[51:23] your sins but having your sins forgiven
[51:26] does not mean that the Holy Spirit or
[51:29] the spirit of life has come back upon
[51:32] you amen we can be justified but we
[51:36] don't want to just be justified we want
[51:39] the Holy Spirit to come back upon us and
[51:44] live within us and and um you know and I
[51:47] I've I've I was thinking here in um
[51:50] there in in the book of Ephesians and
[51:53] we'll we'll get back to reading but um
[51:55] and especially for you kids I would like
[51:57] I'd like for you to turn there if if
[51:59] y'all don't mind um Ephesians
[52:03] 1 now the the the the the the scripture
[52:07] that I love and and brother Bram quoted
[52:09] that thing if he quoted it once he
[52:10] quoted it hundreds of times uh how how
[52:13] many knows uh especially those of you
[52:15] that listen to tapes a lot you've heard
[52:16] brother brandom use that John
[52:18] 5:24 he that heareth my words and
[52:22] believeth on him that sent me ha PA hath
[52:27] eternal life and has passed from Death
[52:30] un unto life um matters of fact I've got
[52:33] it here 6 C 5 John
[52:36] 5:24 um and and I would just read it
[52:39] together that way I don't mess it up I
[52:40] say unto you that he that heareth my
[52:42] word and believeth on him that sent me
[52:45] have everlasting life and shall not come
[52:48] into condemnation but is passed from
[52:52] Death unto life now Christ is the only
[52:57] means for receiving eternal life now the
[53:02] the the God of all eternal life lived in
[53:07] Jesus Jesus Paid that price so that that
[53:11] God of all eternal life can now come
[53:14] back upon us as the believer and and
[53:18] what and and this right here in in
[53:20] Ephesians
[53:22] 1 and um 13 I believe it is
[53:27] uh it says now I want you to see this
[53:29] order in whom ye also trusted after you
[53:34] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[53:37] your salvation so you heard the words of
[53:40] Christ in whom after that ye
[53:44] believed then ye were sealed with that
[53:48] Holy Spirit of Promise which is the
[53:50] earnest of our inheritance until the
[53:53] Redemption of the purchased possession
[53:55] unto the praise of his glory Glory so
[53:57] God is not wanting to make us people of
[54:01] Good
[54:02] Works he doesn't want us to be good
[54:06] people his intention is to live in US
[54:11] eternal life living in us so so we we so
[54:16] we're not we can't measure ourself by
[54:20] the works and say okay I'm a Christian
[54:23] I've got eternal life because well I go
[54:26] to New Life uh brother Wendell's my
[54:28] pastor uh brother random is our prophet
[54:32] and uh and so we're all we're all going
[54:34] to no you you can't you can't do it that
[54:37] way it's the life of Jesus Christ Living
[54:41] in you can you say Amen so we want the
[54:45] life of God to always flow through
[54:49] through through us and while you're
[54:50] there we we'll turn on over to there's
[54:52] another one there in Ephesians uh 3
[54:56] and um let's see
[55:00] uh uh I thought I had it
[55:05] here oh no 4:30 I'm sorry Ephesians 4:30
[55:09] and then we'll go continue on it says
[55:13] um and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[55:17] whereby ye are sealed until the day of
[55:21] redemption let not bitterness and wrath
[55:22] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[55:24] be put away from you with all malice but
[55:26] being kind affection uh uh to one
[55:29] another tender heart and forgiving but
[55:31] grieve not the holy spirit so it's it
[55:34] that Holy Spirit is what SEALs that Holy
[55:37] Spirit is what gives us eternal life can
[55:41] you say Amen so that's what brother
[55:43] brandham is saying it's not it's not
[55:45] Jesus plus
[55:48] Works amen that now y'all you kids
[55:51] understand okay so if you read the book
[55:54] of uh uh if you read there in in the
[55:56] Book of Romans and you read uh Romans uh
[56:01] 2 and the the second chapter and the
[56:03] third chapter brother brand or the
[56:06] Apostle Paul is is dealing with the
[56:09] works of the law because many were
[56:12] trying to say I'm a good person I can
[56:15] but the but the Apostle Paul was saying
[56:18] no this is not what God is after he says
[56:23] God uh uh he says you have those that
[56:26] are of the circumcision that are
[56:28] following the law and yet and and and
[56:31] and yet they possess not eternal life
[56:33] and then you have the Gentiles who does
[56:35] not have a law and saying you've got to
[56:38] live by this code of conduct but he says
[56:40] but it shows the law of God written in
[56:43] their heart because their conscience is
[56:45] accusing or excusing them so when
[56:48] brother brandom is dealing with works
[56:50] that is
[56:52] anything anything we can use works as
[56:56] anything well I go to church all the
[56:58] time well or I'm the pastor or I'm I'm a
[57:00] song leader or I'm a I'm a musician or
[57:03] I'm this or that and we can use that as
[57:06] a crutch as if that is what makes us who
[57:09] we are it is Jesus Christ and his life
[57:14] in us
[57:16] period can you say amen and because of
[57:20] that life in me then he lives his life
[57:24] freely he lives is life freely in me so
[57:28] so I I don't I don't
[57:31] even well praise the Lord can I can I
[57:33] show you one more scripture here real
[57:35] quick uh uh there there in in the book
[57:37] of um uh first corini I believe it is
[57:42] where's where's that where's that
[57:43] scripture found out that says uh when
[57:47] you the unprofitable
[57:50] servant uh when you've done it all let's
[57:53] see
[57:54] um oh oh
[57:58] boy
[58:02] um no that that's that's that that's uh
[58:06] Jesus said that Jesus is using that let
[58:08] me look here real
[58:11] quickly
[58:16] amen okay
[58:18] so
[58:23] um praise the Lord
[58:27] okay so Luke
[58:29] 17 and
[58:31] 7 it says but which of you and you can
[58:34] turn Y and then we'll get back to
[58:38] reading so so what what we do to the
[58:43] Lord the Apostle Paul says present your
[58:45] body as a Living Sacrifice which is your
[58:49] reasonable service it's something that
[58:52] hey he saved you by his grace he come
[58:55] and redeemed you you you were Sinners
[58:56] you were filthy you were you were
[58:58] wretched you you you without Jesus you
[59:02] would have no hope in this life none
[59:05] whatsoever and so he so so at the end of
[59:09] the job at the end when when you've when
[59:11] you've prayed and you fasted and you're
[59:14] and you're going to church and you never
[59:15] miss a service and you do all the you
[59:17] still can't come up to God and
[59:20] say I'm a pretty good old fell I need a
[59:23] I need a pat on the back amen let's read
[59:25] what let's what Jesus says about it here
[59:28] and this is a good one to remember
[59:30] too all right Luke
[59:33] 177 but which of you having a servant
[59:36] plowing or feeding cattle will say unto
[59:40] him by and by when he comes when he has
[59:43] come from the field go and sit down to
[59:45] eat
[59:46] me and will not rather say unto him make
[59:49] R make ready wherewith I may Su and G
[59:54] myself and serve me till I have eaten
[59:56] and drunken afterwards Thou shalt eat
[59:59] and drink does he thank this thank the
[1:00:03] servant because he did the things that
[1:00:05] were commanded to him I think not so
[1:00:10] likewise when you have done all those
[1:00:13] things which are commanded you say we
[1:00:18] are unprofitable servants we have done
[1:00:22] that which was our duty to do
[1:00:27] amen so even after even after I mean
[1:00:32] even after it's all said and
[1:00:34] done I'm still an unprofitable
[1:00:38] servant there is nothing I can do you
[1:00:42] see what I'm saying not my goodness not
[1:00:45] my singing not my preaching not not
[1:00:48] anything else I do I cannot come before
[1:00:52] the Lord and say ha no that's my
[1:00:56] reasonable service that that that that
[1:00:58] is something that that I ought to do
[1:01:01] amen because of God's grace upon me it
[1:01:05] earns me no
[1:01:09] points no brownie points when it's all
[1:01:12] said and done that's why when that's why
[1:01:15] brother Bram says when he comes and
[1:01:17] though he has won those Millions to the
[1:01:19] Lord and and and if they ever come to
[1:01:21] give him a crown he says I'll take the
[1:01:23] crown and put it at the feet of Jesus
[1:01:25] Jesus cuz I'm not worthy of it that's an
[1:01:30] in unprofitable servant can you say amen
[1:01:34] amen so so when you've done it all
[1:01:38] Hallelujah I I thought i' I'd wrote it
[1:01:40] down here in the Amplified I um
[1:01:45] uh yeah yeah here in Luke 17 And1 so you
[1:01:49] two when you have done everything was
[1:01:52] assigned and commanded to you say we are
[1:01:55] unworthy servants undeserving of Praise
[1:01:57] or a reward for we have not gone beyond
[1:02:00] our obligation we have merily done what
[1:02:04] we ought to do I thought that was pretty
[1:02:05] good amen all right so let's go let's go
[1:02:08] back here to uh let's so it's not it's
[1:02:11] not salvation Plus or it's not Jesus
[1:02:13] plus works it is Jesus and Jesus
[1:02:20] alone oh I hope that's so real to you
[1:02:24] it's life it's the life of God oh let us
[1:02:28] strive it's not in your
[1:02:30] prayer what what would it be in a in a
[1:02:32] one hour prayer and not getting a hold
[1:02:35] of God than a and compared to a heart
[1:02:39] that that is so wanting to come in God
[1:02:42] and maybe you only spend 15 minutes but
[1:02:44] you're weeping before God and you're and
[1:02:46] you're you're in fellowship with God God
[1:02:49] would rather have the 15 minutes of real
[1:02:52] genuine life than to have all of this
[1:02:54] other flowery stuff Stu he wants life he
[1:02:58] wants his spirit in
[1:03:00] us he wants us to be a part of him amen
[1:03:05] he says uh the first paragraph he says I
[1:03:08] feel I could just go on and on about
[1:03:10] these truths but I will give you one
[1:03:12] more thought it is about the wonderful
[1:03:15] hymn that AB Simpson wrote once it was
[1:03:18] the blessing now it is the Lord once it
[1:03:20] was the feeling now it is his word once
[1:03:23] his gift I wanted now The Giver
[1:03:26] once I sought for healing now himself
[1:03:30] alone all in all forever Jesus will I
[1:03:34] sing Everything Is Jesus and Jesus
[1:03:37] everything can I hear an
[1:03:39] amen there isn't anything in this life
[1:03:42] satisfying as it may be as good and as
[1:03:45] fine as it may be but you will find the
[1:03:48] sum total of all perfection in Christ
[1:03:52] everything fails Fades into
[1:03:55] insignificant besides him he that hath
[1:03:58] the Key of David this beautiful phrase
[1:04:00] follows and comes out of the preceding
[1:04:03] phrase he that is true Christ the
[1:04:06] perfect realization contrasted with the
[1:04:08] partial realization here it is Moses was
[1:04:11] a prophet of God but Jesus like unto
[1:04:13] Moses was the prophet of God David a man
[1:04:17] after God's Own Heart was the king of
[1:04:19] Israel but Jesus is the greater David
[1:04:21] King of Kings Lord of lords God very God
[1:04:27] now David was born of the tribe of Judah
[1:04:30] out of whom no priest came yet he ate of
[1:04:33] the shoe bread reserved for priest he
[1:04:36] was a great warrior overcoming the enemy
[1:04:38] established the people as king he sat on
[1:04:42] the throne he was a prophet he was a
[1:04:44] wonderful type of Christ now it says in
[1:04:47] Isaiah
[1:04:48] 22:22 and the key of the House of David
[1:04:51] will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall
[1:04:54] open and None Shall shall shut he shall
[1:04:57] shut and None Shall open the spirit uses
[1:05:01] this Old Testament reference concerning
[1:05:03] the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry
[1:05:05] in the church what the Key of David
[1:05:09] signifies at that time is mar Shadow
[1:05:12] which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing
[1:05:16] in the midst of the lampstand now go
[1:05:17] catch this church he's saying that it
[1:05:20] was just a shadow then but it is now in
[1:05:23] its completion it right now in
[1:05:26] you he says was a mar Shadow but now
[1:05:29] fulfilled in in Jesus standing in the
[1:05:31] midst of the lampstands it has to do
[1:05:33] with our Lord after his resurrection not
[1:05:35] his Earthly pilgrimage but what does
[1:05:38] this key signify the answer lies in the
[1:05:40] position of the key it's not in His
[1:05:43] Hands it is not worn around his neck it
[1:05:46] is not placed in the hands of other men
[1:05:49] or the verse could not be saying that he
[1:05:51] alone has the use of that key for he
[1:05:54] alone opens and shuts and no man has the
[1:05:56] right but Jesus himself isn't that right
[1:06:00] but where is the key it's on his
[1:06:02] shoulder but what does that shoulder
[1:06:05] what does shoulder have to do with it
[1:06:08] read Isaiah 9 and6 and the government
[1:06:10] shall be upon his shoulder but what does
[1:06:13] this mean the answer is this the phrase
[1:06:17] government upon his shoulder comes from
[1:06:19] the wedding ceremony of the East I just
[1:06:22] love this when the bride has been
[1:06:24] committed to the groom to take off her
[1:06:26] veil and places it on the groom's
[1:06:29] shoulders signifying that not only is
[1:06:32] she under his Dominion she has
[1:06:34] transferred her rights to him that he is
[1:06:37] the head but also that he Bears the
[1:06:41] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:06:43] and he alone no one else no other man no
[1:06:49] other power has any right and
[1:06:53] responsibility that beloved is the Key
[1:06:56] of David God being Sovereign he forew by
[1:07:00] Divine decree exactly who would be in
[1:07:04] his bride he chose her she did not
[1:07:07] choose him he called her she did not
[1:07:10] come on her own he died for her he
[1:07:13] washed her in his own blood he paid the
[1:07:16] price for her she belongs to him and him
[1:07:21] alone she is wholly committed to him and
[1:07:23] accepts the obligation he he or see she
[1:07:27] is ho wholly committed to him and he
[1:07:30] accepts the obligation he is her head
[1:07:33] for Christ is the head of the church as
[1:07:35] Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the
[1:07:38] bride is happy that he is her
[1:07:41] Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is
[1:07:45] her
[1:07:46] Delight but have men in heeded this
[1:07:48] truth have they esteemed his person who
[1:07:52] alone has the full Sovereign authority
[1:07:54] over the church
[1:07:55] I say no for in every age the church has
[1:07:59] been governed by a hierarchy a
[1:08:01] priesthood an Apostolic succession
[1:08:04] closing the door of mercy and Grace To
[1:08:06] whom it will and instead of assuming the
[1:08:09] love and responsibility of the church it
[1:08:11] has been the uh mercenary lust prayed
[1:08:15] upon her and destroyed her the clergy
[1:08:19] lived in luxury while the poor fed on
[1:08:21] the husk of abuse not one age did any
[1:08:25] different
[1:08:26] each bound itself to organization and
[1:08:29] put government upon men and committed
[1:08:31] the church to that
[1:08:32] government dare let any let the people
[1:08:35] rise up they were be brutally suppressed
[1:08:38] and cast out every denomination has the
[1:08:41] same Spirit every denomination swears it
[1:08:44] has the key to the government of the
[1:08:46] church every denomination claims that it
[1:08:49] opens the doors but that is not true it
[1:08:53] is Jesus and Jesus alone
[1:08:56] he sets the members in his body he
[1:08:58] endows them with their Ministries he
[1:09:00] puts the gifts at her disposal he cares
[1:09:03] for and guides her he is she is his sole
[1:09:08] property and he has no other one but her
[1:09:12] someone shout
[1:09:13] hallelujah what a far cry from reality
[1:09:18] is this church age in which we live we
[1:09:21] one and one day soon these men that even
[1:09:25] now purport to speak for the church will
[1:09:27] be rising up in the acumenical move to
[1:09:30] place the living Antichrist at the head
[1:09:32] of the organization which deposes the
[1:09:34] Lord and we will call him Christ out
[1:09:37] outside the church saying behold I stand
[1:09:41] at the door and knock If any man hear my
[1:09:44] voice and open the door I will come in
[1:09:46] to him and will suck with him and he
[1:09:49] with me Revelations 3:20 but let me say
[1:09:52] this our Lord is not defeated men claim
[1:09:55] to open the door to God and shut the
[1:09:57] door they are liars all that the father
[1:10:00] hath given him will come to him and he
[1:10:03] that cometh to him uh in no wise will be
[1:10:06] cast out he will lose none of them St
[1:10:11] John 637 to-39 when the last elected
[1:10:16] member to the body of Christ comes in
[1:10:18] then will our Lord appear the Key of
[1:10:22] David was not David the king of Israel
[1:10:26] all Israel is not Jesus the son of David
[1:10:29] according to the fact that he will sit
[1:10:32] upon the throne of David and the
[1:10:33] Millennium and Reign and rule over his
[1:10:36] Heritage surely so the Key of David
[1:10:39] signifies that it is Jesus he will bring
[1:10:43] in the Millennium he who has the keys to
[1:10:46] death and hell will raise up his own
[1:10:48] that they may share in his reign of
[1:10:51] righteousness upon the Earth how
[1:10:54] beautiful that our Lord has all the
[1:10:56] answers truly in him are all the
[1:11:00] promises of God fulfilled truly by being
[1:11:03] in him we are HS to what he purchased
[1:11:06] for us yes there he stands the Lord Of
[1:11:10] Glory once as the father he was
[1:11:12] surrounded by the Angels and Archangels
[1:11:14] the cherubims and the seraphim and the
[1:11:16] whole host of Heaven crying holy holy
[1:11:19] holy is the Lord God of host such was
[1:11:22] his Holiness that no man could approach
[1:11:24] unto him but now we see him in the
[1:11:26] church sharing his own Holiness with us
[1:11:30] until in him we have become the very
[1:11:33] righteousness of God
[1:11:35] hallelujah yes and there he stands Jesus
[1:11:38] perfect everything lily of the valley
[1:11:41] bright and Morning Star the fairest of
[1:11:44] 10,000 Alpha and Omega rude and
[1:11:47] offspring of David Father Son and Holy
[1:11:49] Ghost all in all Isaiah 9 and6 For unto
[1:11:54] us a child is born
[1:11:56] unto us a son is given the government
[1:11:58] shall be upon his shoulder and his name
[1:12:01] Shall be Called wonderful counselor the
[1:12:04] Mighty God the Everlasting father the
[1:12:06] Prince of
[1:12:07] Peace in him is perfect fulfillment the
[1:12:10] once we established him not or esteemed
[1:12:14] him not now we love him with joy
[1:12:16] unspeakable and full of Glory in the
[1:12:19] midst of the church he stands and we
[1:12:21] will sing his praise for he is mighty
[1:12:23] the mighty conqueror for he the mighty
[1:12:26] conqueror is head over the church which
[1:12:28] is his bride he bought that bride he
[1:12:32] owns her she is his and his alone and he
[1:12:36] cares for her he is our King we are his
[1:12:39] kingdom Eternal POS his eternal
[1:12:42] possession now you will
[1:12:44] recall that at the beginning of verse 7
[1:12:47] I said that verse 9 would help us to
[1:12:50] understand it I hope you saw what I
[1:12:52] meant Jesus set himself forth as he
[1:12:56] did as as he that is Holy true the only
[1:13:01] reality the one with the Key of David
[1:13:03] the one who opened and shut that is
[1:13:06] exactly true those phrases describe him
[1:13:10] perfectly but the Jews in his day
[1:13:12] refused him and all he was they rejected
[1:13:16] their Savior and all he meant to them
[1:13:19] and the ninal Christian has now done the
[1:13:22] same they have done what the Jews did
[1:13:24] exact exactly the Jews crucified him and
[1:13:27] then turned on the True Believer the
[1:13:29] nominal Christian has crucified a fresh
[1:13:31] the True Believer the nominal Christian
[1:13:34] has crucified him aresh and turned on
[1:13:36] the true church to destroy it but God is
[1:13:39] true and he who is above all will yet
[1:13:44] return and when he does he will show who
[1:13:46] the only potentate is as he proves
[1:13:50] himself to be to the world and all the
[1:13:53] world bows at his feet and at that time
[1:13:56] all the world will bow at the feet of
[1:13:58] the Saints proving that they were right
[1:14:01] in their stand with him blessed be
[1:14:05] God
[1:14:08] forever what a powerful reading tonight

[1:17:58] can have you can have u i I'll pick on
[1:18:01] these two girls right here so they can
[1:18:05] they can be the best of friends both of
[1:18:07] them's good singers both of them's
[1:18:09] pretty one short and uh I mean one's
[1:18:14] tall um so
[1:18:18] but and and both of you go to church
[1:18:21] both of you raised in church but one has
[1:18:24] the Holy Ghost and one
[1:18:26] doesn't okay all right which one's
[1:18:32] again so so um since I pick on Haven so
[1:18:37] much I want to put you as the Holy Ghost
[1:18:38] all right you got the Holy Ghost and uh
[1:18:40] so I'm G to I'm want to get it when I
[1:18:42] get home or get out of here
[1:18:46] now
[1:18:49] Haven loves the
[1:18:51] Lord Aubrey loves the Lord
[1:18:55] and and
[1:18:57] um but there's there's a difference
[1:18:59] between them both of them have long hair
[1:19:01] both of them sing pretty both of them
[1:19:03] cry both of them
[1:19:05] uh but one still has the nature of
[1:19:10] sin in
[1:19:12] them now this is not true I'm just using
[1:19:16] you as an as an
[1:19:17] example and that nature of
[1:19:20] sin it makes it all work related
[1:19:25] so she has to make her she knows it's
[1:19:28] right because the Bible she hears it all
[1:19:29] the time but there comes a time where
[1:19:33] that nature is going to come out there's
[1:19:35] going to come a time where you're going
[1:19:37] to just get tired of the of of the rules
[1:19:40] and the
[1:19:41] regulations because it's all
[1:19:44] works and and you'll and and you'll get
[1:19:47] discouraged and you'll and and you'll
[1:19:48] want a bucket because you're you're
[1:19:50] you're you you've still got that sin
[1:19:52] nature in you on the other hand
[1:19:56] this one that has the baptism of the
[1:19:58] Holy Ghost May struggle growing up just
[1:20:01] like you would struggle growing up but
[1:20:04] you've got something on the inside of
[1:20:06] you it's the life of God that is
[1:20:09] correcting you that is that that is as I
[1:20:14] as I um as I quoted a while ago there in
[1:20:17] the book of
[1:20:19] Romans uh Romans and you can put that up
[1:20:21] to Romans 2 and4 when the Gentiles which
[1:20:25] have not the law do by Nature the things
[1:20:29] contained in the
[1:20:32] law these having not the law are a law
[1:20:36] unto themselves which show The Works of
[1:20:40] the law written in their hearts and
[1:20:44] their conscience also bearing witness
[1:20:47] and their thoughts the meanwhile
[1:20:49] accusing or
[1:20:51] excusing one
[1:20:53] another so so you so you can it's it's
[1:20:58] what is considered a law and and and
[1:21:01] you're having to and it's and it's a law
[1:21:02] you just you know you it's you're having
[1:21:05] to make yourself or your mama's making
[1:21:06] you or the preacher's making you or
[1:21:08] something's making you and then but over
[1:21:10] here you're learning you're still
[1:21:12] learning you you still have to repent
[1:21:15] you still have to that's that's not
[1:21:17] that's that's not it there the nature of
[1:21:21] the Holy Spirit on the inside of you is
[1:21:25] is bringing your body bringing your mind
[1:21:29] everything about you into The Obedience
[1:21:33] of the holy God that holy God lives in
[1:21:36] you living his life you see what I'm
[1:21:38] saying so that's the reason why some
[1:21:41] kids can they they they come up they're
[1:21:42] growing in church they come right up
[1:21:44] they come right up and then all of a
[1:21:46] sudden once they get that once they get
[1:21:48] that rebellious Years or or get gets to
[1:21:51] that point boom they're out and you
[1:21:53] think what happened I I thought they
[1:21:54] were good
[1:21:56] Christians and now they're all G now
[1:21:58] they're out what are they what see they
[1:22:00] didn't have the Holy Ghost there was
[1:22:04] there was there was a desire but they
[1:22:07] did not have the life it was work
[1:22:11] oriented see the life of God is not work
[1:22:14] oriented the life of God is life
[1:22:17] oriented it's who you
[1:22:20] are you see what I'm saying so as as so
[1:22:23] what that's what brother brandham is
[1:22:24] saying here he says everyone is going to
[1:22:27] the work side trying to trying to say to
[1:22:30] to make themselves look good around
[1:22:32] everyone I'm a Christian and they're
[1:22:34] missing out on Jesus and Jesus alone if
[1:22:39] the spirit that raised up Christ from
[1:22:41] the dead dwell in you it will Quicken
[1:22:44] your mortal
[1:22:46] bodies you see what I'm saying so so
[1:22:49] that's what it is now I am not saying
[1:22:51] you don't have the Holy Ghost amen so
[1:22:54] but but what I am but but y y I'm I'm
[1:22:56] showing y'all the contrast all of my
[1:22:59] buddies when I was growing up amen we we
[1:23:02] were all I had I had I had buddies uh we
[1:23:05] we had you know four or five good
[1:23:06] buddies and uh and did you know that
[1:23:10] that when when it was all said and
[1:23:12] done I was the only
[1:23:16] one I was the only one left
[1:23:19] standing and it wasn't that I was good
[1:23:22] it wasn't any of that
[1:23:25] is I was diligent to get the Holy Ghost
[1:23:29] and to make sure that I was secured in
[1:23:31] Jesus
[1:23:33] Christ have I had a lot of mistakes have
[1:23:36] and
[1:23:37] failures great day yes but there's one
[1:23:40] thing about me his Spirit has kept me
[1:23:44] all the days of my
[1:23:47] life Hallelujah good days bad days UPS
[1:23:51] Downs ins outs all of that that doesn't
[1:23:53] matter what matters is the life the life
[1:23:58] of God within every one of us how many
[1:23:59] wants the life of God in
[1:24:02] you amen amen so so I I I I I did so
[1:24:08] that's that's what I was trying to to
[1:24:10] make sure uh that I get a a the point
[1:24:13] across to y'all tonight now if there's
[1:24:15] anyone else that has anything else to
[1:24:16] say um uh any other questions anything
[1:24:20] like that y'all feel free we got done a
[1:24:23] little little early
[1:24:24] like 15
[1:24:27] amen
[1:24:44] yes
[1:24:48] yeah coming to Pony and stuff and just
[1:24:50] kind of re-evaluate my life looking back
[1:24:54] kind
[1:24:56] of getting myself refocused and making
[1:24:59] sure I was on the right path yeah and
[1:25:02] stuff that was one of the things that
[1:25:05] that came up was like well I've done all
[1:25:07] this and I've done all this and and I
[1:25:10] I've been a Christian all these years
[1:25:11] and and I know God gave me the Holy
[1:25:15] Ghost when I got saved and stuff but
[1:25:17] that's just something that was just kind
[1:25:19] of bugging me like how I lived all those
[1:25:21] years and I did all those things
[1:25:25] God gave me I feel or showed
[1:25:29] me
[1:25:32] was like when
[1:25:35] um you get to the other side and there's
[1:25:37] that that scripture that talks about
[1:25:39] like separating the Lambs or the sheep
[1:25:41] and the like that
[1:25:44] and there there's the ones
[1:25:48] that come to God that did the works yeah
[1:25:54] that well didn't I do this and didn't I
[1:25:57] do that and didn't and he actually tells
[1:25:59] and they grew right up they loved God
[1:26:01] yeah they were Christians yeah Didn't I
[1:26:05] do this didn't I all this in your name
[1:26:07] didn't I cast out devils and didn't I
[1:26:10] sure and he said depart from me yeah and
[1:26:13] he actually told you know and there were
[1:26:15] the ones he had said you know when I was
[1:26:19] hungry you fed me and when I was naked
[1:26:21] you clothed me and when I
[1:26:24] when did I do that yeah they actually
[1:26:26] didn't recognize that they were doing
[1:26:28] works yeah they didn't realize that they
[1:26:31] were because it was a
[1:26:33] life that was in them that they didn't
[1:26:36] even they wanted to please God so bad
[1:26:39] they wanted to live that life so bad
[1:26:41] that they didn't realize they were
[1:26:43] already doing those works and it was
[1:26:45] pleasing to him said when when you when
[1:26:50] you fed the poor and when you you know
[1:26:51] all these things that they they realiz
[1:26:54] that they were doing it yeah and just
[1:26:57] something that God yeah showed me like
[1:27:02] yeah both profess to be Christians yeah
[1:27:05] and he told
[1:27:07] one
[1:27:09] yeah one realized that they were doing
[1:27:12] the works but I did this and I did you
[1:27:14] know the other didn't realize it at all
[1:27:16] it was just a life that was being Liv
[1:27:19] yeah and something amen amen that's good
[1:27:24] that's that is
[1:27:26] good and uh and and that's and that's
[1:27:29] what we want we want to we want to be so
[1:27:32] in love you know that song Falling In
[1:27:33] Love With Jesus was the best thing I
[1:27:35] ever done his his life just
[1:27:39] so living through us it's just you don't
[1:27:43] calculate it you don't it's just it's
[1:27:46] just who you are and what you are it it
[1:27:48] it flows out you know it just and and
[1:27:52] works it works its part of it Jesus says
[1:27:56] if a if if a if a brother asks you to go
[1:27:59] a mile he says tell him heck no I've
[1:28:03] worked all day today he says go two
[1:28:06] miles your brother asked for your coat
[1:28:08] give him your cloak
[1:28:09] also it's it's it but now you say oh my
[1:28:13] it's the life it's what's in you it's
[1:28:16] who you are here it exhibits Christ was
[1:28:21] the life of God that laid down his love
[1:28:24] life for every one of
[1:28:26] us so it's it's just who we are it's a
[1:28:29] sacrificial life that's the life of God
[1:28:33] in us so and you don't I don't I just
[1:28:37] don't I don't see Christ I don't see
[1:28:39] Christ keeping keeping count keeping
[1:28:41] score I just believe Christ was just he
[1:28:45] just oozed the life of God out of
[1:28:47] him God in Christ reconciling the
[1:28:51] world I can see brother Merle thinking
[1:28:56] nothing
[1:29:05] but yeah that and and that is true and
[1:29:10] and um um what is that Colossians
[1:29:13] Colossians 2:7 sister
[1:29:17] kala using
[1:29:22] uh that's not it
[1:29:28] um let's see
[1:29:30] Colossians um amen oh boy I've gotten so
[1:29:36] used to using a computer anymore I used
[1:29:37] to be able to I used to be able to find
[1:29:39] these things so easily It's Made Me
[1:29:42] Dumber um where where's where's that at
[1:29:44] Christ in you the hope this mystery oh
[1:29:46] it's it is it it's it's 2 Corinthians 2
[1:29:50] 2 Corinthians
[1:29:52] 2:7 amen
[1:29:58] Colossians 127 okay now now look at the
[1:30:02] beauty of this to whom God would make
[1:30:05] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:30:09] this
[1:30:10] mystery what's the mystery of the church
[1:30:12] ages what's the mystery of it all and
[1:30:14] again I'm just a baby tonight as I've as
[1:30:18] I've been looking over this it's just
[1:30:20] just so rich to me the M the glory of
[1:30:23] the my is Christ in you it's God wanting
[1:30:30] to live in you what uh why would we ever
[1:30:33] turn that down why would we want why
[1:30:36] would we want to
[1:30:38] substitute that for anything else
[1:30:42] amen
[1:30:44] amen praise the Lord sister Carol
[1:31:00] mhm that's true that that is true and
[1:31:05] and in the Pentecostal and in the
[1:31:07] Pentecostal
[1:31:08] real chances are they did speak in
[1:31:11] tongues you know they they they might
[1:31:14] have and and
[1:31:16] and and they relied on those
[1:31:20] Works they relied instead of having the
[1:31:23] life of God I spoken tongues just like
[1:31:26] the the scripture that sister titha have
[1:31:28] we not cast out Devils that's works
[1:31:31] that's work related I I've I've cast out
[1:31:34] Devils so and Jesus will say no I don't
[1:31:36] even know yet so so it's not anything
[1:31:41] anything I cannot use anything that I do
[1:31:45] for the Lord as as as evidence that I
[1:31:49] have eternal life the only way that I'll
[1:31:53] know that I have etal etal life and that
[1:31:54] is if the spirit of Christ lives in me
[1:31:59] and agrees with his
[1:32:01] word
[1:32:02] amen hey I appreciate the conversation
[1:32:05] tonight and uh and and and adding to it
[1:32:07] because I think it does it does help our
[1:32:09] our young ones because
[1:32:11] I I want I I I want our kids to really
[1:32:17] understand this that we have
[1:32:20] um
[1:32:22] it's how how precious just what that we
[1:32:25] do have you know we're very we're very
[1:32:28] blessed anybody else and the musicians
[1:32:30] can can
[1:32:33] come praise the
[1:32:37] Lord
[1:32:49] amen amen you know I I'm believing I'm
[1:32:54] I'm believing
[1:32:55] for I'm believing for uh all of our all
[1:33:00] of our backsliders to come home leaving
[1:33:04] for those for those kids to come home
[1:33:07] and you've been an example before them
[1:33:09] and they just they they just they just
[1:33:11] need the life of God if they ever see it
[1:33:13] if they ever experience
[1:33:16] it it's really not even a choice when
[1:33:19] you experience the life of God you don't
[1:33:21] want anything else but him really
[1:33:26] the the rigid works and the the the
[1:33:29] rigid things of that is not is not what
[1:33:32] we're striving for we're striving for
[1:33:35] Life the Holy Spirit to live his life in
[1:33:39] us and that's what that's what all of
[1:33:42] these backsliders need they need to they
[1:33:44] need to experience Christ for himself
[1:33:47] the Apostle Paul did Peter
[1:33:50] did all of the old or all of those in
[1:33:53] the the book of
[1:33:54] Acts they experienced the the living
[1:33:58] Christ and it made them you couldn't
[1:34:01] turn them around you
[1:34:03] know and they weren't offered anything
[1:34:05] really spectacular they weren't offered
[1:34:07] homes businesses jobs they they weren't
[1:34:11] offered those
[1:34:12] things they were going to lose it all
[1:34:15] but what they experienced when they met
[1:34:18] Jesus
[1:34:20] Christ they were willing to die in
[1:34:23] defeat
