[40:19] [Applause]
[40:24] so are you in town
[40:26] a long time or
[40:27] [Music]
[40:32] okay okay
[40:34] well I'm glad you did amen well it's
[40:38] good to see brother Tom and just good to
[40:41] see everyone here this evening and
[40:45] um
[40:45] I just know God's got something really
[40:47] special for every one of us here tonight
[40:50] amen let's look here in the Book of
[40:53] Psalms the 62nd chapter
[40:56] and um amen we're going to
[41:00] um
[41:02] instead of I want to I'm going to pull
[41:05] off my subject that we have been
[41:08] doing for the um
[41:11] yeah um
[41:13] the mysterious one walking in the midst
[41:16] of the candlesticks and I'd like to just
[41:18] speak on Revelation for tonight and
[41:23] um
[41:24] and and it's important that that that we
[41:28] in anything that we take we don't we
[41:31] don't want to receive any of the word
[41:33] just with words but we want revelation
[41:37] to really strike our hearts as to what
[41:40] we're doing because amen we can put
[41:42] pencil to paper but that doesn't always
[41:45] that doesn't two plus two doesn't always
[41:47] equal four with God and so we want we
[41:51] always want divine revelation amen and
[41:54] so this is going to be a simple uh uh a
[41:57] text here tonight but I want us to look
[42:00] here at Psalm 62 and 1.
[42:04] and um
[42:06] it says truly my soul waiteth upon God
[42:10] from him cometh my salvation he only is
[42:14] my rock and my salvation he is my
[42:17] defense I shall not be greatly moved
[42:20] how long will he imagine Mischief
[42:22] against a man ye shall be slain all of
[42:25] you as a bowing wall shall ye be as a
[42:29] tottering fence
[42:31] they only consultant to cast him down
[42:34] from his Excellency they Delight in lies
[42:36] they bless with their mouth they curse
[42:38] inwardly it's Allah my soul wait thou
[42:42] upon God for my expectation is from him
[42:45] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[42:49] is my defense I shall not be moved and
[42:53] God is my salvation my glory the rock of
[42:58] my strength my refuge is in God

[47:35] with an organ amen
[47:37] and um so you know we're we're thankful
[47:41] we're just thankful for the Lord for
[47:43] that we had a wonderful time and they
[47:45] sent their greetings back here to the
[47:47] church and
[47:49] um uh we just appreciate all of you guys
[47:52] uh we heard uh I I'd seen there where my
[47:56] brother Joe had had told me about about
[47:59] his deal with his with his lungs and and
[48:02] I want to tell you brother Joe we are
[48:04] not going to accept any rattlesnakes
[48:07] from the Devil we're not going to accept
[48:10] anything the devil has to offer
[48:13] and um many are the afflictions of the
[48:17] righteous and that's that's that's a
[48:18] promise that is just as much Bible as as
[48:22] God so loved the world Amen many are the
[48:26] afflictions of the righteous
[48:28] but the Lord delivers them out of them
[48:31] all that's also the Bible amen and so uh
[48:37] we we trust in the Lord for that can you
[48:40] say man and so we've got this rock of my
[48:44] salvation amen this rock of Revelation
[48:47] and so I want to to speak because in
[48:51] this hour it's an incredibly uh Dark Age
[48:54] it's a it's a dark it's a dark time so
[48:58] many questions and and and so many
[49:00] attitudes and and so many
[49:03] interpretations to scripture there's
[49:06] there are so many uh things to keep your
[49:09] emotions running wild
[49:11] there are so many things to keep your
[49:13] mind uh uh looking amen from this and
[49:18] this and this but I want to tell you
[49:20] there is a rock of Revelation that we
[49:24] must build upon amen it's a it's a it's
[49:28] the rock of divine revelation and so as
[49:33] we as we look we as Believers amen it is
[49:37] our duty it is our duty to make sure
[49:41] that we are building upon the right
[49:44] things we cannot build according to our
[49:46] mental Powers we cannot build in our
[49:49] Christian walk or our amen anything
[49:51] about us except we look and build
[49:55] according to the word of God and the
[49:58] word of God is the only thing that is
[50:00] eternal amen now you can't build
[50:03] according to my opinion you can't build
[50:04] according to any other man's opinion we
[50:08] build according to the word of the law
[50:11] now this is what we're preparing for
[50:14] we're preparing for Eternal amen
[50:17] eternity we are preparing for eternal
[50:20] life and God in this in this world that
[50:23] we're living amen that is that that we
[50:26] can we can get so caught up with a man
[50:30] uh with with with all of the Fantastics
[50:33] of the world but everything of this
[50:36] world will fail it will come to not amen
[50:41] every man will come tonight only God's
[50:45] Divine word will endure forever amen
[50:50] that's right there is there is nothing
[50:52] nothing that is more important than God
[50:56] to reveal his word to us
[51:00] when we say reveal we're saying God what
[51:04] you have had in your mind amen your
[51:07] desires I'm asking that you would drop
[51:09] them down into my heart that's the
[51:12] reason why the psalmist amen says there
[51:15] in Psalms 1 21 and 1 I will lift up mine
[51:20] eyes unto the hills from which cometh my
[51:24] help
[51:25] my help comes from the Lord amen he will
[51:31] not suffer thy foot to be moved and he
[51:35] that keepeth thee will not Slumber can
[51:38] you say amen that's comforting brother
[51:40] Joe is when the enemy's coming in he
[51:43] that keeps me will never Slumber it's
[51:47] it's wonderful to know that he that
[51:50] saved me will complete that which he has
[51:54] started in my life now this Earthly
[51:56] journey is going to be an incredible
[51:59] journey of a of faith it is safe amen
[52:03] it's uh it's a it's it's it's it's not
[52:06] you don't know what tomorrow holds you
[52:09] don't know what next week coach we don't
[52:11] know what's going to happen amen we
[52:14] don't know who's going to be elected as
[52:16] the president but you see God's given us
[52:19] in this dark hour that we're living in
[52:22] he's given us divine revelation again
[52:25] he's taking a piece of himself dropping
[52:30] it in our heart to give us the same
[52:32] settledness that he has
[52:35] God doesn't worry and neither should you
[52:38] God doesn't have to guess and neither
[52:41] should you God knows everything is going
[52:45] to be okay and so should you
[52:49] man he only is my rock he only is my
[52:53] salvation he only is my strength he only
[52:56] is my refuge he only is my defense he
[52:59] only he only he is my rapture
[53:03] he is my understanding can you say man
[53:07] so when we say God is my revelation we
[53:11] are saying amen that he that when we say
[53:14] that he is my rock we are saying he is
[53:17] my Revelation amen
[53:20] Jesus Christ is the revelation of God
[53:25] I want to say this the bride who can
[53:29] take that word in their hearts becomes
[53:32] the revelation of God
[53:34] the bride becomes the revelation of God
[53:38] for the day that they're living in
[53:40] because the mind of God has been
[53:44] manifested unto them
[53:47] praise the Lord Revelation when Jesus
[53:51] asked his disciples who do men say that
[53:52] I am and some say well you're this and
[53:55] some say you're that some say you're
[53:58] this well I heard someone say this and
[54:00] that and amen but when he asked them who
[54:04] do you say that I am
[54:07] and I think that's important for every
[54:09] one of us every one of us have got to
[54:11] come to the amen have got to come face
[54:14] to face with reality what is my opinion
[54:18] I say that I'm a Believer I say that I'm
[54:20] a Christian I say I want God I say I
[54:24] want a deeper Revelation but when God
[54:27] comes himself to manifest
[54:31] are we willing
[54:33] to allow God to reveal himself to us
[54:38] praise the Lord amen now you can't have
[54:41] faith in what your mama's thought or
[54:44] what you think is right you've got to
[54:47] have faith in what God's revelation is
[54:52] for the day
[54:53] are you with me
[54:55] because your faith is going to be tried
[54:58] amen your faith is going to be tried
[55:00] will it be on a solid rock
[55:04] will your Revelation endure the testing
[55:09] that will come Amen brother your test
[55:12] your faith is going to be tested and I
[55:15] just want to ask when your faith is
[55:17] being put to the test will you remain
[55:21] standing
[55:25] oh come on now amen it's a little bit
[55:29] different story when the doctor is
[55:31] telling you you're going to die it's a
[55:33] little bit different story what it is
[55:35] your child that is backslip it's a
[55:38] little bit different story amen when you
[55:40] your best friend walks away from the
[55:43] message will you still be standing when
[55:47] the trusting of your revelation
[55:52] can you say Amen because we want faith
[55:56] we want a revelation that is just as
[56:01] strong as Gladius
[56:04] amen
[56:05] Peter stands up
[56:07] and he says I Know Who You Are
[56:10] you're the Christ
[56:12] you're the Messiah
[56:14] you're the anointed one
[56:16] and Jesus said blessed art thou Simon
[56:19] barjona for flesh and blood is not
[56:21] revealed this unto you amen
[56:24] but my Father which is in heaven and I
[56:27] say unto thee that thou art Peter and
[56:29] Upon This Rock what was that rock the
[56:32] revelation of the father I will build my
[56:35] church
[56:36] and the gates of hell
[56:39] will not prevail
[56:42] against it
[56:44] so your Revelation
[56:46] becomes your anchor
[56:50] amen
[56:52] Revelation now it becomes your anchor
[56:54] now we can put things on the board here
[56:56] and we can sort of and and we can take
[56:59] some of the revelations that brother
[57:00] Branham has brought but until we can see
[57:03] ourselves ourselves on that board
[57:08] we'll praise the Lord until we can see
[57:11] ourselves
[57:12] in the candlesticks until we can see
[57:19] out today because I want to tell you
[57:21] everything in the Book of Revelations
[57:22] amen is simply unveiling Who You Are
[57:29] man
[57:31] oh his word anchors me can you say Amen
[57:33] Hallelujah
[57:35] someone that can stand up and say I know
[57:38] who I am
[57:39] someone who can stand up and say I know
[57:42] the season that I'm living in
[57:44] someone that can stand up and say the
[57:46] world is preparing for tribulation but
[57:49] God is preparing me for my eternal home
[57:54] someone that can stand up
[57:57] who I am
[58:01] nothing can stop it it's already been
[58:03] spoken
[58:04] the rock of my strength
[58:08] and my refuge
[58:10] is in God
[58:12] can you say Amen
[58:13] no wonder he could say they're in Psalm
[58:15] 62 and 2 or 8
[58:18] trust in him at all times
[58:21] pour out your heart before him
[58:23] God has a refuge for us
[58:26] many say pray for me
[58:28] to be healed brother Wendell
[58:31] amen
[58:33] many times instead I think people should
[58:37] be praying
[58:38] saying Teach me the word
[58:41] so that I can cooperate with God
[58:45] pray for my children to be saved brother
[58:47] Wendell I think many times someone needs
[58:50] to say teach me the word
[58:52] so that I can cooperate with God
[58:56] well praise the Lord
[58:58] healing you
[59:00] ought for healing it's already yours
[59:02] you've got to find out how to get it
[59:05] you don't have to death amen or find are
[59:08] you asking beg for victory it's already
[59:11] yours but you've got to cooperate with
[59:14] God
[59:15] to do what it takes to get it well
[59:17] praise the Lord so the Revelation is the
[59:22] illumination amen it is the will of God
[59:26] made known it is the light
[59:29] that lights every believer's pathway
[59:34] now can there be light in darkness
[59:37] when there's Darkness all around
[59:39] and I say that's where the Paradox Lays
[59:43] because the promise was in the Twilight
[59:45] time
[59:46] is when the light shall be his Noonday
[59:50] that's what the Bible said
[59:52] in the Twilight time is when your light
[59:56] shall be as the Noonday
[59:59] it's in the gross darkness that the
[1:00:02] Bible says the paths of the just will be
[1:00:06] growing brighter and brighter how do I
[1:00:09] know that I'm growing brighter and
[1:00:11] brighter is because his word is becoming
[1:00:14] more real and more real and more real
[1:00:21] it's not in learning it's in trusting
[1:00:23] it's not in learning it's an
[1:00:25] understanding it's a revelation of who
[1:00:28] you are they're in proverbs 4 and 18. it
[1:00:30] says but the path of the just is as The
[1:00:34] Shining Light that shineth more and more
[1:00:37] unto the perfect way Day and The Way of
[1:00:41] the Wicked is as darkness and they know
[1:00:44] not at what they stumble so while The
[1:00:47] Stumbling is going on
[1:00:49] here's the elect Walking with God in
[1:00:52] divine revelation
[1:00:55] Hallelujah hallelujah it's no wonder
[1:00:58] Isaiah 60 and 1. what does it say arise
[1:01:02] Shine for thy Revelation has come
[1:01:13] because the glory of the Lord has risen
[1:01:18] upon thee and then the next verse the
[1:01:22] whole Darkness
[1:01:24] Darkness
[1:01:26] shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness
[1:01:28] to people but the Lord shall arise upon
[1:01:33] thee
[1:01:34] and His glory shall be seen upon thee
[1:01:39] what can you say Amen
[1:01:41] so your deed your position
[1:01:45] depends on your revelation
[1:01:49] praise the Lord
[1:01:50] it's just as simple as that my position
[1:01:54] depends on the understanding that God
[1:01:57] has given to me
[1:02:01] that's why we want to pray Lord
[1:02:03] give me
[1:02:05] divine revelation
[1:02:07] I think it takes prayer I I think I I
[1:02:10] think I think every one of us should be
[1:02:12] very prayerful saying God I want you to
[1:02:15] reveal yourself to me
[1:02:17] that doesn't mean you're going to be
[1:02:18] become a mathematician or that you're
[1:02:20] going to become a scholar or that you're
[1:02:22] going to be able to quote the scriptures
[1:02:24] but it does let you know one thing here
[1:02:26] there's a settled heart in knowing that
[1:02:29] you are the scripture for this day
[1:02:32] there's a subtle heart it's not that you
[1:02:34] can quote everything it's not that you
[1:02:36] you even understand the all the seals or
[1:02:39] that you understand all of those things
[1:02:40] are those things are simply there to let
[1:02:43] you know who you are and you've got to
[1:02:46] rest with absolute assurance
[1:02:50] because it's that Revelation that is
[1:02:53] going to pull us out of this world
[1:02:56] can you say man
[1:02:57] that's the reason why the Apostle Paul
[1:02:59] says in Ephesians 1 and 17 that the god
[1:03:02] of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of
[1:03:04] Glory may give unto you the spirit of
[1:03:08] wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge
[1:03:10] of him the eyes of your understanding be
[1:03:13] an enlightened that you may know what is
[1:03:16] the hope of his calling and what the
[1:03:18] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:03:19] in the Saints and what is the exceeding
[1:03:22] greatness of his power oh God this
[1:03:26] Revelation is not a revelation of I'm
[1:03:27] just going to barely get by this
[1:03:29] Revelation is a revelation that God
[1:03:32] Lives in You oh
[1:03:36] he says what is the exceeding greatness
[1:03:37] of his power to us word who believe
[1:03:39] according to the working of his mighty
[1:03:41] power which he wrought in Christ when he
[1:03:44] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:03:46] his own right hand in Heavenly places
[1:03:47] far above all principality and power and
[1:03:50] might and dominion and every name that

[1:04:52] read
[1:04:56] start at the first verse
[1:04:58] praise the Lord do you love him
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:04] it says he began to teach by the seaside
[1:05:07] and there was gathered unto him a great
[1:05:10] multitude
[1:05:11] so that he entered into a ship and set
[1:05:13] in a sea in the whole
[1:05:15] uh multitude was by the Sea and the land
[1:05:18] and he taught them
[1:05:19] many things but parables
[1:05:22] he said unto him in his Doctrine hearken
[1:05:24] behold there went out a soul were to sow
[1:05:28] and it came to pass as he sold some fell
[1:05:30] upon the Wayside and the fowls of the
[1:05:32] air come and divide it up some fell on
[1:05:35] Stony ground
[1:05:37] where it had much Earth and immediately
[1:05:39] it sprung up because uh and because it
[1:05:43] had no depth but when the sun was up it
[1:05:46] was scorched
[1:05:48] and because it had no root it withered
[1:05:50] away
[1:05:51] some fell among thorns and the Thorns
[1:05:54] grew up and choked it and it yielded no
[1:05:56] fruit other fell on good ground and did
[1:05:59] yield fruit that sprang up and increased
[1:06:01] and brought forth some 30 some 60 some
[1:06:03] 100.
[1:06:05] and he said unto them he that has ears
[1:06:08] to hear Let Him hear
[1:06:12] and when he was alone they that were
[1:06:14] about him
[1:06:15] with the twelve asked him of the parable
[1:06:18] and he said unto them
[1:06:21] unto you is given to know the mystery of
[1:06:27] the kingdom of God
[1:06:29] but unto them that are without all these
[1:06:33] things are done in parables
[1:06:36] sing then they may see and not perceive
[1:06:40] hearing they may hear and not understand
[1:06:43] let's let any time they should be
[1:06:47] converted and their sins should be
[1:06:49] forgiven them now he is speaking in
[1:06:52] parables
[1:06:54] Hallelujah now as they left didn't
[1:06:57] understand the parable neither
[1:06:59] but he knew the elect would come and say
[1:07:01] teach us
[1:07:03] teach us the parable
[1:07:06] teach us the parable now everyone's
[1:07:08] heard what you said
[1:07:10] but the 12 is saying
[1:07:12] we want to understand what this means
[1:07:15] well glory to God
[1:07:18] you see now watch he says unto you is
[1:07:22] given to know the Mysteries but unto
[1:07:24] them it is done in parables
[1:07:26] amen saying they see they don't perceive
[1:07:30] now then he began to explain
[1:07:33] what was taking place and he and he says
[1:07:36] the 13th verse and he said unto them no
[1:07:38] ye not this Parable how then shall you
[1:07:40] know all Parables the sower so with the
[1:07:43] word
[1:07:44] and these are they by the wayside where
[1:07:48] the word is sown and when they have
[1:07:50] heard Satan immediately cometh
[1:07:52] immediately and taketh away the word
[1:07:54] that was sown in their hearts
[1:07:56] and these are likewise which are on
[1:07:58] Stony ground who when they heard the
[1:08:01] word
[1:08:02] immediately receive it with gladness
[1:08:07] and have no root in themselves and so
[1:08:11] endure but for a Time
[1:08:13] afterward when Affliction or persecution
[1:08:17] arises for the word's sake immediately
[1:08:21] they are offended
[1:08:24] and these are they that are sown among
[1:08:27] the Thorns such as hear the word the
[1:08:29] cares of this world and the
[1:08:30] deceitfulness of riches and lusts of
[1:08:32] other things entering in chokes the word
[1:08:35] and it becomes unfruitful these are they
[1:08:39] which are sown on good ground such as
[1:08:42] hear the word
[1:08:44] receive the word and bring forth fruit
[1:08:52] there's where God's looking for every
[1:08:55] one of them heard
[1:08:57] but only one
[1:09:00] had revelation
[1:09:02] well glory to God
[1:09:05] now I I I don't want to just be hearers
[1:09:07] the scripture says you can be hearers
[1:09:09] forgetful hearers
[1:09:12] we don't want to be forgetful hearers we
[1:09:14] want the Revelation to come because it's
[1:09:16] the Revelation that goes down deep well
[1:09:19] praise the Lord
[1:09:20] amen now look at that the Wayside the
[1:09:25] Wayside a ground
[1:09:27] amen the word is sown it's sown but when
[1:09:32] they hear it Satan comes in immediately
[1:09:36] Hallelujah this happens right in the
[1:09:38] church service
[1:09:41] preachers are preaching and because we
[1:09:43] are so caught up
[1:09:47] of this world and we're so caught up
[1:09:50] well praise the Lord amen and it just
[1:09:53] immediately jokes out we've not spent
[1:09:55] any time seeking Revelation we've not
[1:09:57] spent any time calling out we've not
[1:10:00] separated ourselves and and but the
[1:10:03] Wayside the word is preached in there it
[1:10:06] writes to them just like the one with
[1:10:08] the good ground
[1:10:10] man
[1:10:12] and when they hear it immediately
[1:10:15] are y'all hearing me Satan comes in and
[1:10:18] say well I got to work tomorrow well I
[1:10:19] got to do this well I've got to do that
[1:10:21] instead of preparing your ground for the
[1:10:22] word to come instead of covering that
[1:10:24] word over in your heart well glory to
[1:10:27] God I I listen folks amen I don't want
[1:10:32] to sit in a church
[1:10:35] hearing service after service after
[1:10:38] service and not have any revelation
[1:10:42] oh my oh my
[1:10:45] just punching my time clock in punching
[1:10:47] my time clock in well can you say amen
[1:10:50] amen God's not interested in you
[1:10:52] punching your time clock in God wants
[1:10:54] that word to take root in your heart
[1:11:01] amen now he's not telling that out there
[1:11:04] to the world because the Revelation is
[1:11:06] given to the elect
[1:11:08] the Revelation the understanding to
[1:11:11] these scriptures are given to the elect
[1:11:15] now it's up to the elect
[1:11:17] someone say I'm elect
[1:11:20] you can be elect and still have Stony
[1:11:22] ground
[1:11:25] we've got to prepare
[1:11:28] our minds and our hearts well praise the
[1:11:30] Lord
[1:11:31] now Jesus wouldn't be telling them amen
[1:11:34] but now and then and then you've got and
[1:11:37] then you've got those a man that you
[1:11:39] know they they they hear the words
[1:11:42] that's Stony Crown they hear the word
[1:11:44] all
[1:11:47] the word is so rich and the word is so
[1:11:51] good and we are so blessed
[1:11:55] oh brother Wendell oh you're a good
[1:11:59] preacher
[1:12:02] and then as soon as the trial hits
[1:12:07] right
[1:12:10] all hits the purse execution comes and
[1:12:13] the Bible just told us for the word's
[1:12:16] sake
[1:12:18] the trial is coming because you have
[1:12:23] embraced the way the word
[1:12:27] and because there's no root
[1:12:29] man we've been offended and and then
[1:12:33] before you know it amen well are you
[1:12:35] hearing me
[1:12:36] it only endures for a Time
[1:12:39] but now watch that now now catching with
[1:12:41] that Stony Crown that's 16th verse it
[1:12:44] says immediately receive it with
[1:12:46] gladness have no root in themselves so
[1:12:49] endure but for a time and afterward when
[1:12:51] Affliction or persecution arrived for
[1:12:54] the word's sake
[1:12:57] immediately they are offended
[1:13:00] but there's an elect
[1:13:02] that is saying I don't want the cares of
[1:13:04] this world
[1:13:05] I don't want anything taking it away
[1:13:07] from me
[1:13:08] let this word have its root
[1:13:12] half let me stand upon That Rock of Ages
[1:13:16] well praise the Lord
[1:13:19] Jesus there in Luke 10 and 21.
[1:13:23] it says in that hour
[1:13:25] Jesus rejoiced in spirit
[1:13:28] and said I thank the old father Lord of
[1:13:30] Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid
[1:13:33] these things
[1:13:35] from the wise and prudent
[1:13:38] and has revealed them
[1:13:42] unto babes
[1:13:44] the elect
[1:13:45] oh hallelujah oh how our hearts how how
[1:13:49] our heart should be soft
[1:13:52] Lord don't let these Mysteries don't let
[1:13:55] these Mysteries just fall on this but
[1:13:58] let it fall right here is that right
[1:14:00] amen because because everyone's reading
[1:14:03] the book but I want to have the
[1:14:04] Revelation for myself now watch this
[1:14:07] watch this it says and as revealed under
[1:14:09] the base even so father
[1:14:11] I love this for so it seemed good in thy
[1:14:16] sight
[1:14:18] things are delivered to me of my father
[1:14:20] and no man knoweth who the son is but
[1:14:24] the father and who the father is
[1:14:27] baptistan
[1:14:29] and he to whom the son will reveal him
[1:14:39] or when he's revealing when that word's
[1:14:41] coming forth when that are y'all are
[1:14:43] y'all catching my drift here when that
[1:14:45] word is coming forth what kind of a
[1:14:46] grant now he's he's not reading he says
[1:14:48] I'm I'm putting it in Parables out there
[1:14:50] for them but I'm revealing it unto you
[1:14:52] but now you've got to make sure that
[1:14:55] while he's revealing it what kind of a
[1:14:57] ground it's going to be resting on
[1:15:00] Hallelujah I thank God I I think that
[1:15:02] there should be a real dedication around
[1:15:05] the time of church services and about
[1:15:06] the time that we're going into our Bible
[1:15:08] study and our devotions is Lord open
[1:15:12] your heart up to me when I'm listening
[1:15:13] to those messages when I'm when I'm
[1:15:15] reading the Bible when I'm when I'm
[1:15:17] coming and setting in the church
[1:15:18] services Lord let my
[1:15:21] well praise the Lord
[1:15:23] amen when it gets to the point to where
[1:15:25] we're just barely sliding in in time for
[1:15:27] church to start amen it it shows that a
[1:15:30] mountain that that that that that that
[1:15:32] the preparation that the prophet taught
[1:15:34] us how to come in early and and to
[1:15:37] settle things and quieten our spirits
[1:15:39] and be prepared for the word to come
[1:15:43] we're fine that there's other things
[1:15:46] that begin to come in and crowd it out
[1:15:50] before you know it you're gonna you're
[1:15:52] you're it's crowding out your Victory
[1:15:54] it's crowding out the very thing that
[1:15:57] God's intended for you
[1:16:00] it's the revelation of God that empowers
[1:16:05] you to overcome the enemy
[1:16:09] God revealing himself to you
[1:16:12] can you say amen and again God is not
[1:16:15] the words on a book God is that Living
[1:16:18] Word he's the logos
[1:16:21] God is that pulsating word not words
[1:16:25] here
[1:16:26] yeah you can take every word that is in
[1:16:28] this book and write another book with
[1:16:30] those words
[1:16:32] right
[1:16:34] but he's the Living Word
[1:16:37] he's the pulsating word
[1:16:39] he's the word that knows every thought
[1:16:40] he's the word that knows every he knows
[1:16:42] your tomorrows he's the word that he's
[1:16:44] the word that spoke the world into
[1:16:46] existence he's the word that is
[1:16:48] revealing himself to you
[1:16:54] I love it I love it amen John 14 and 16.
[1:16:58] amen then it says and I will pray the
[1:17:01] father and he will shall give you
[1:17:04] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:17:06] you forever even the spirit of Truth
[1:17:09] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:17:13] sees him not
[1:17:15] in other words there's no revelation
[1:17:17] neither unders knoweth or understand of
[1:17:21] him
[1:17:22] but you know him
[1:17:25] for he dwells with you
[1:17:27] and shall be in you brother Branham was
[1:17:30] asked the question what is the evidence
[1:17:32] this is in 64. what is the evidence that
[1:17:35] a person is really filled with the Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost
[1:17:38] he says John 14 26 when the Holy Ghost
[1:17:41] has come
[1:17:44] he will show you things to come
[1:17:46] he'll perfect it somebody say he'll
[1:17:49] perfect it
[1:17:51] man-maids won't do it but he is the word
[1:17:54] when he's the Holy Ghost has come he
[1:17:58] will identify himself in you with the
[1:18:02] scripture
[1:18:03] that is the true sign that the holy
[1:18:05] spirit is in you because it is the word
[1:18:07] can I hear a great big
[1:18:11] he will
[1:18:17] I get the scripture
[1:18:20] Lord don't let me don't let me just read
[1:18:22] the Bible and see something of the past
[1:18:24] let me read the Bible and say ah oh this
[1:18:29] is happening all around me
[1:18:31] oh
[1:18:32] I'm part of a big plan yeah
[1:18:36] yeah now let me read the Bible as just a
[1:18:38] history book no The Living Word is
[1:18:42] making the pages the words on the pages
[1:18:44] come off the pages and live in you
[1:18:49] then when you wake up in the morning
[1:18:51] time you know that you are the one that
[1:18:54] God's put here on this Earth
[1:18:55] and you can turn around and say search
[1:18:57] the scriptures for in them you think you
[1:18:59] have eternal life and they testify of me
[1:19:02] why because the logos that revealed to
[1:19:06] Jesus who he was is the same logos
[1:19:08] that's revealing to you who you are
[1:19:12] it'll never happen as long as it's words
[1:19:15] on a page as long as it's something on a
[1:19:17] chalkboard it's got to be the reality
[1:19:19] within your heart
[1:19:23] can you see man
[1:19:27] now can you imagine worshiping without a
[1:19:30] revelation
[1:19:31] going through the motions without
[1:19:33] understanding what God is doing
[1:19:35] brother random talking about their own
[1:19:37] the men on the road to Emmaus
[1:19:39] they were walking
[1:19:41] without divine revelation yet they were
[1:19:44] the elect of God
[1:19:46] he says they don't even realize
[1:19:50] that they're the ones as fulfilling
[1:19:52] scripture
[1:19:53] amen
[1:19:55] now no he's this one here is not talking
[1:19:57] about them this is talking about the
[1:19:59] Pharisees I'm sorry that's fulfilling
[1:20:01] the scripture and people don't realize
[1:20:04] that that doing these things and saying
[1:20:06] these things are fulfilling scripture
[1:20:08] how little did Caiaphas the high priest
[1:20:10] and those priests in that day that
[1:20:13] scoffed and made fun of him
[1:20:15] they didn't know that
[1:20:17] the very God that they were singing
[1:20:20] about my God why is Thou forsaken me the
[1:20:23] 22nd song my hands and my feet they've
[1:20:25] pierced singing that in the temple and
[1:20:28] him dying up there on the cross little
[1:20:31] did they know they were doing it
[1:20:39] they're the scripture was right
[1:20:43] the present tense
[1:20:50] but because they'd learned it here
[1:20:53] and they weren't seeking for Revelation
[1:20:55] here
[1:20:57] they messed
[1:21:02] mess oh Jesus
[1:21:04] can you say Amen
[1:21:05] he says even Jesus prayed father forgive
[1:21:08] them for they know not what they
[1:21:12] are doing
[1:21:15] can you say Amen
[1:21:16] now
[1:21:19] but it's not that way
[1:21:22] you teenagers you you kids mamas and
[1:21:25] daddies it's totally different for this
[1:21:28] bride
[1:21:29] it says brother Branham and the Rapture
[1:21:31] says there you go there you are back to
[1:21:33] that blindness again trampling over the
[1:21:36] things of God as if it didn't mean
[1:21:38] nothing scoffing and making fun of it
[1:21:39] that's what the Bible said but to the
[1:21:42] church
[1:21:43] to the bride the Rapture is a revelation
[1:21:47] to her
[1:21:48] it's revealed to her
[1:21:51] that Revelation the True Blood of Christ
[1:21:53] will be waiting
[1:21:55] for that revelation
[1:21:58] of the rapture
[1:22:00] what is it
[1:22:02] brother Brandon says when she
[1:22:04] recognizes who
[1:22:07] she is
[1:22:09] then the Rapture will take place
[1:22:14] he says searched the scriptures
[1:22:17] identified himself and then he told all
[1:22:19] the rest of them look at the scripture
[1:22:21] baby
[1:22:24] I'm the living proof I'm the
[1:22:26] I'm booked about and the church should
[1:22:28] have that kind of a revelation today
[1:22:31] this should be such a a a a a a rock bed
[1:22:35] you've built your house on you built
[1:22:38] your emotions on you built your thinking
[1:22:40] on you built your belief system on
[1:22:45] this revelation of this hour is God
[1:22:49] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:22:55] amen
[1:22:57] can you say man
[1:22:59] then there's nothing that can take you
[1:23:01] out
[1:23:02] brother madam
[1:23:06] says when a man once catches the vision
[1:23:09] of the invisible God
[1:23:12] and knows that he's always present
[1:23:15] there's something
[1:23:17] that stabilizes that man's thinking
[1:23:21] it stabilizes his actions
[1:23:24] and in the time of distress and trouble
[1:23:27] it'll still make him look upward and
[1:23:30] above the things that are happening
[1:23:31] around about him
[1:23:33] because he's looking at the Unseen yet
[1:23:38] by a promise he's lacking glory to God
[1:23:46] nothing could stop Moses after the
[1:23:48] revelation
[1:23:52] praise the Lord
[1:23:56] nothing
[1:23:58] why
[1:24:00] because God showed him the purpose
[1:24:03] God showed him the time
[1:24:07] after that burning bush
[1:24:09] there was nothing going to turn him
[1:24:11] around
[1:24:13] [Laughter]
[1:24:15] his emotions couldn't play with him
[1:24:17] anymore
[1:24:18] and there wasn't no egyptian going to
[1:24:19] run him out of Egypt anymore
[1:24:22] he was the man
[1:24:24] he had a purpose
[1:24:26] and he knew it was God's time
[1:24:29] and brother brother Branham says when
[1:24:31] Moses found out now the real
[1:24:34] direct will of God
[1:24:36] and the time of God
[1:24:38] and the revelation of everything to do
[1:24:41] now try to keep him out of Egypt
[1:24:43] right back to Egypt he went just as hard
[1:24:46] as he could go for he knew that God
[1:24:50] had promised Deliverance
[1:24:53] and the time had come
[1:24:56] for deliverance
[1:24:58] [Laughter]
[1:25:01] now did it mean the obstacles were in
[1:25:03] the way did it mean that everyone all of
[1:25:06] the elect of Israel those that have been
[1:25:08] ordained to come out in Egypt were going
[1:25:11] to understand no no no no no no no no
[1:25:14] they all turned on him
[1:25:18] are causing our troubles leave us alone
[1:25:24] but Moses said I'm God's deliverer
[1:25:27] and you're coming out
[1:25:29] Hallelujah
[1:25:31] Hallelujah something about a mom and a
[1:25:34] Daddy who know who they are no matter
[1:25:36] what what the children are going through
[1:25:37] no matter what the situation is God has
[1:25:41] ordained us for such a time as this
[1:25:46] something about a hey man a good leader
[1:25:48] when everything's going crazy and
[1:25:50] everything's upside down he just keeps
[1:25:52] he just keeps his Compass toward the
[1:25:55] North
[1:25:55] he keeps right on a walking says I know
[1:25:58] it won't let us down
[1:26:00] can you say Amen
[1:26:02] hallelujah oh do you love him
[1:26:05] man
[1:26:06] oh how we need it
[1:26:08] this is the reason I say
[1:26:10] I thought we would just speak on this
[1:26:12] here tonight and I know it's just simple
[1:26:15] but I want I want I want not just
[1:26:18] learning
[1:26:19] amen
[1:26:21] oh when you can see yourself in those
[1:26:24] seals when you can see yourself in those
[1:26:25] Church ages when you can see
[1:26:30] when you can see that this mysterious
[1:26:32] one walking in the candlesticks
[1:26:35] is Christ in you
[1:26:41] when you can see that
[1:26:45] that is word
[1:26:47] and this word is simply to open up this
[1:26:51] word to you
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:26:58] when you see this promise this word says
[1:27:02] that is me
[1:27:05] preacher can't make you do that
[1:27:07] a preacher can't give you a revelation
[1:27:10] a preacher can't make you anything
[1:27:13] you
[1:27:15] are the product
[1:27:17] of him
[1:27:20] someone told me here the other day said
[1:27:22] well brother Wendell I'm just so stupid
[1:27:24] amen right man listen to some of the
[1:27:27] these Wednesday nights and I've just
[1:27:29] felt like
[1:27:30] I should know a lot more than what I
[1:27:32] know
[1:27:33] and I just
[1:27:35] it wasn't you amen
[1:27:37] praise the Lord
[1:27:42] although I was just talking about
[1:27:44] candlesticks and Austin says I'm lost
[1:27:47] just joking
[1:27:55] God's Not Call he might not have called
[1:27:56] you to be a preacher
[1:27:58] he might not have called you to be able
[1:28:00] to to see things
[1:28:02] but there's one thing about it
[1:28:06] what you do here and what you do see
[1:28:09] you know it's for you
[1:28:13] and it stabilizes you
[1:28:15] now you might not be able to turn around
[1:28:17] and tell people what the stars are or
[1:28:19] what the you know what what the horns
[1:28:21] represent or what this one represents
[1:28:23] what the eyes are uh you know the seven
[1:28:25] eyes
[1:28:26] represents and and all of those things
[1:28:28] and we're thankful for that and that's
[1:28:30] reason why we're going through it is so
[1:28:31] you can see that it's the supernatural
[1:28:34] God
[1:28:35] to a natural Church
[1:28:39] it's the supernatural God marrying
[1:28:44] Humanity
[1:28:47] just as two thousand years ago it was
[1:28:49] the supernatural invisible God living in
[1:28:52] a body in a man
[1:28:55] now it's the great invisible God
[1:28:59] the Hallelujah what's the seven eyes
[1:29:01] because there's going to be Seven Ages
[1:29:02] what's the seven horns because amen
[1:29:05] that's the Lamb's protection is that
[1:29:07] right seven eyes is Prophet God the
[1:29:10] seers whose seven Church ages what is it
[1:29:13] it is God
[1:29:19] himself in a body not the Redeemer body
[1:29:24] of Jesus but the redeemed body of Jesus
[1:29:28] Christ
[1:29:29] living in you
[1:29:34] when you make mistakes
[1:29:36] you know that there's a bloody lamb
[1:29:39] oh can you say Amen I'm glad I'm glad
[1:29:42] that an angel did not bring
[1:29:45] the book
[1:29:47] and open the seals
[1:29:50] I'm glad it was the lamb
[1:29:53] because while he's handing you the book
[1:29:55] He's Still the Lamb
[1:29:58] he's still bleeding
[1:30:01] he is still well praise the Lord
[1:30:04] and that blood will be just as powerful
[1:30:08] until the very last of God's elect
[1:30:12] sees their names in that book
[1:30:17] men have tried to come in and say huh
[1:30:19] there ain't no more blood left
[1:30:21] he's left the throne the intercession
[1:30:23] now he's got the book
[1:30:26] no one can be saved after 65 then they
[1:30:29] said no one can be saved after 77. no
[1:30:31] one can be saved and I want to say here
[1:30:32] tonight that the Lamb's blood
[1:30:36] is still for you
[1:30:42] can you say Amen
[1:30:43] it's that revelation
[1:30:46] it's that re you see there's the three
[1:30:48] revealings
[1:30:50] there's the three revealings it's in the
[1:30:53] symbol form
[1:30:54] then it brought from a prophet in the
[1:30:57] revealing form to let you see what
[1:31:01] everything is then there's the actuality
[1:31:05] where the lamb comes and claims you in a
[1:31:09] rapture
[1:31:11] that's why brother Branham taught us
[1:31:13] you've got to hear that cry first
[1:31:15] because or that shout it's that shout
[1:31:18] that is letting you know what the book
[1:31:21] is saying
[1:31:22] and when you see it by divine revelation
[1:31:26] you stand up and prepare yourself you
[1:31:30] hear the Midnight Cry say the bridegroom
[1:31:33] cometh he's coming announced it to you
[1:31:38] not my brother not my mama but it's me O
[1:31:41] Lord
[1:31:42] can you say Amen y'all catch that it's
[1:31:46] revelation
[1:31:48] to me
[1:31:50] and brother Branham in there revelation
[1:31:52] of Jesus Christ he says no man knows the
[1:31:55] things of God Save The Spirit of man
[1:31:57] and he to whom the spirit of God reveals
[1:32:00] them
[1:32:01] we need to call on God for Revelation
[1:32:03] more than anything else in the world
[1:32:07] we have accepted the Bible we have
[1:32:10] accepted the great truths of it
[1:32:13] but it still is not real to most people
[1:32:17] because the Revelation by the spirit is
[1:32:19] not there
[1:32:21] the word has not been quickened
[1:32:23] the Bible says in second Corinthians 5
[1:32:26] and 21
[1:32:28] that we have become the righteousness of
[1:32:30] God by our Union with Christ Jesus Jesus
[1:32:33] Christ
[1:32:33] did you get it
[1:32:35] it says that we are the very
[1:32:37] righteousness of God himself by being in
[1:32:42] Christ
[1:32:43] it says that he Jesus became sin for us
[1:32:48] it does not say that he becomes sinful
[1:32:51] but he became sin for us
[1:32:54] that by our Union with him we might
[1:32:59] become the righteousness of God
[1:33:02] now if we accept the fact and we must
[1:33:04] that he literally became sin for us by
[1:33:07] his substitution for us then we must
[1:33:10] also accept the fact that we by our
[1:33:13] Union with him have become the very
[1:33:14] righteousness of God
[1:33:16] to reject one is to reject the other to
[1:33:19] accept one is to accept the other now we
[1:33:21] know the Bible says that it can't be
[1:33:24] denied but the revelation of it is
[1:33:26] missing
[1:33:28] it is not real to the majority of God's
[1:33:30] children it's just a good verse in the
[1:33:34] Bible
[1:33:35] but we need to have it made alive
[1:33:38] somebody say alive
[1:33:41] to us and that will take
[1:33:45] revelation
[1:33:48] do you understand what he's saying is
[1:33:49] that beautiful
[1:33:52] come sin
[1:33:54] for you
[1:33:55] then you've also got to accept the fact
[1:33:57] that you become the righteousness of God
[1:34:01] I guarantee you if you really understand
[1:34:03] that you're the righteousness of God you
[1:34:05] you you're going to do some high
[1:34:06] stepping
[1:34:08] can you see man there ain't no beat down
[1:34:10] there ain't no well what if well maybe I
[1:34:13] no sir
[1:34:15] Revelation has told me who I am and I'm
[1:34:17] standing on the Rock of Ages
[1:34:19] I don't care hell or high waters come
[1:34:22] I'm standing I'm secure I'm anchored
[1:34:26] I've anchored my soul in that precious
[1:34:29] Rock of Ages
[1:34:31] can you say Amen
[1:34:33] amen
[1:34:34] yes sir now as we close
[1:34:38] brother random says every seed must come
[1:34:40] after his kind
[1:34:42] God made Man In His Image after his kind
[1:34:45] to be his word on the Earth
[1:34:48] he expressed it in Christ Jesus Christ
[1:34:50] what was God was in Christ
[1:34:54] that's a man after his kind
[1:34:57] when God which is the word how many
[1:34:59] knows he's the word
[1:35:00] when the word was in Christ amen a human
[1:35:04] man expressing itself through him that
[1:35:08] was God the word in Christ
[1:35:12] expressing itself you want to know why
[1:35:16] that I've been as we've been dealing
[1:35:17] with these this mysterious one and I
[1:35:19] keep saying that it was a man and I've
[1:35:22] really been talking about how it was a
[1:35:26] man that God created to redeem
[1:35:34] because he come to create or to redeem
[1:35:36] men
[1:35:38] and women
[1:35:40] he says and God in the beginning made
[1:35:41] man in his own image that's the kind of
[1:35:43] man
[1:35:44] that God makes today
[1:35:46] the Seminary the incubator Hatchery
[1:35:48] turns out a bunch of hybrids the schools
[1:35:52] but when God calls a man he's his own
[1:35:54] image the word Made Alive in him
[1:36:00] that's right there he is that's God's
[1:36:02] man man in God's Own image is his very
[1:36:05] likeness
[1:36:07] Jesus said he'll do the works that I do
[1:36:09] so God made man in his own image after
[1:36:14] his kind his kind what is his kind the
[1:36:18] word he is the word then if any man
[1:36:21] denies God's word how can he be in God's
[1:36:23] image just ask the question ask yourself
[1:36:27] how can you be in God's image and deny
[1:36:30] God's word when the word is expressed
[1:36:33] image of himself oh he says it doesn't
[1:36:37] it doesn't mean that the express image
[1:36:40] of God will say oh I said it
[1:36:43] but I oh yeah he's he's saying the
[1:36:47] express image of God would say oh I said
[1:36:50] it but I don't really mean it I was
[1:36:52] wrong there I back up
[1:36:54] that was for some other time I didn't
[1:36:55] mean it oh mercy
[1:36:57] trash slump of the devil
[1:37:00] that's what he fed Eve don't let him try
[1:37:03] to poke it down the elected neck
[1:37:05] no sir they won't believe that just come
[1:37:09] join with our gang join nothing you've
[1:37:12] got to be born not joined a new creature
[1:37:16] in his own image of his kind to be his
[1:37:20] word expressed here on the Earth
[1:37:23] now Jesus was God's expressed word do
[1:37:26] you believe that
[1:37:28] do you believe it
[1:37:29] then what are we to be sons of God too
[1:37:33] with the expressed word in the church
[1:37:36] carrying on
[1:37:38] is it Lutheran kind after the Luther
[1:37:40] Methodist kind after the Methodist
[1:37:42] Catholic kind Catholic Catholic
[1:37:44] Pentecostal kind after it's kind the
[1:37:47] Oneness kind the Trinity after it's
[1:37:50] but if you're God's kind that is
[1:37:53] different
[1:37:54] you see that you're the expressed image
[1:37:56] of the word making itself manifest oh my
[1:38:00] why it's got to if the water falls on it
[1:38:04] it's got to then you then give him a
[1:38:07] birth
[1:38:08] God made him after his very own image
[1:38:14] well give me that kind of a revelation
[1:38:17] I don't want it here
[1:38:19] I want it here
[1:38:21] this here Puffs you up this here oh
[1:38:25] it gives you eyesight wait a minute

[1:38:39] about he's about killed himself drinking
[1:38:41] and doing drugs and a young man
[1:38:45] and
[1:38:49] and there he is about you know
[1:38:52] struggling to live
[1:38:56] and I said you
[1:38:58] you're missing purpose
[1:39:00] you ever get some purpose in your life
[1:39:03] then you won't be sitting around waiting
[1:39:05] on the first of the month for someone
[1:39:06] for some kind of a check coming from the
[1:39:09] government

[1:39:12] you drink yourself to a stupor and
[1:39:14] you're living in with those drugs
[1:39:16] because you have no purpose
[1:39:20] Hallelujah
[1:39:22] so my advice to him for him to get
[1:39:24] purpose is to get out and get a job
[1:39:27] get some purpose about you

[1:39:36] amen get some purpose about you
[1:39:40] you ain't got no purpose and that you
[1:39:41] you feel worthless

[1:39:47] because you ain't doing what you were
[1:39:49] supposed to or you just put here on
[1:39:51] Earth to do
[1:39:55] get some get some purpose about you and
[1:39:57] get your responsibility back before you

[1:40:14] always call it alcoholic mentality the
[1:40:16] woe is me mentality it's everyone else's
[1:40:18] fault and I can't ever succeed and it's
[1:40:21] it's you know and I've heard it all of
[1:40:23] my life

[1:40:42] filling up time I'm here with purpose
[1:40:46] I'm here with Divine Purpose
[1:40:48] and because of Divine Purpose
[1:40:50] I don't have my head in the TV all the
[1:40:52] time
[1:40:53] and because of Divine Purpose
[1:40:56] I'm not listening to that radio all the
[1:40:58] time and because of Divine Purpose I'm
[1:41:00] not letting that Sports Animal stuff get
[1:41:02] Amen in my mind because I've got purpose
[1:41:10] Revelation has struck my heart you can't
[1:41:13] turn that you can't turn me away from it

[1:41:35] the message in the past I might have I
[1:41:37] might have had Tower times with
[1:41:39] television in the past I might have had
[1:41:41] a hard time amen with you know with the
[1:41:43] radio in the past and the talk show
[1:41:45] hosts in the past and listen to the
[1:41:47] conservative stock shows and all that
[1:41:48] that one yes yes yes
[1:41:52] but when Revelations struck
[1:41:54] I don't belong here
[1:41:57] and I know
[1:41:59] that if that word is going to have its
[1:42:00] effect in my life it's going to fall on
[1:42:03] good ground
[1:42:05] it's got to follow in good ground
[1:42:08] that means I've got to keep my garden
[1:42:12] well praise the Lord
[1:42:15] I've got to keep the ground right
[1:42:17] because I won
[1:42:19] revelation
[1:42:21] to have its perfect work
[1:42:23] I want these seeds these Divine seeds
[1:42:27] of this Bible
[1:42:29] to have such an effect
[1:42:32] in this human body
[1:42:38] it ain't nothing that this body can do
[1:42:40] and if you start putting it here your
[1:42:41] body will never produce the supernatural
[1:42:43] but I promise you
[1:42:45] if you weed your own garden this whole
[1:42:47] this old ground here
[1:42:50] and let him drop the seeds in by
[1:42:51] Revelation it'll change the way it'll
[1:42:55] change everything about you
[1:42:57] in fact
[1:42:59] it's going to produce a brand new body
[1:43:02] it's going to produce

[1:43:16] eternal life that has
[1:43:19] the power

[1:43:27] I don't have hair who cares whether I
[1:43:29] live in a in a mansion or a shanty who
[1:43:31] cares only thing I want
[1:43:33] I want the seeds of God to grow in me
[1:43:37] I want revelation to be living in me can
[1:43:41] you say man
[1:43:42] if the musicians would come
[1:43:48] oh that's my rock
[1:43:51] that's my salvation
[1:43:53] it's no wonder
[1:43:55] the Apostle Paul says now thanks be unto
[1:43:58] God who always
[1:44:00] calls us
[1:44:02] to Triumph
[1:44:04] and maketh manifest the savior of his
[1:44:07] knowledge
[1:44:12] by me
[1:44:14] in every place

[1:44:38] I believe this is a great hour
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:44] I wish I could make the world to see it
[1:44:46] I wish I could make our community see it
[1:44:51] [Music]

[1:45:02] please
[1:45:03] pry the eyelids open
[1:45:12] [Music]
