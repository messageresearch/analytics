love my kids I I'd tell you right now I'd do anything for them I'd even tell you I'd take a bullet for them but could you do what Jesus Christ did honestly could you I mean we think about it in the heat of a moment we might would jump in between somebody and take a bullet I get that it's the Heat of the Moment it's a spur of a thing Jesus Christ lived his life knowing he knew brothers and sisters that's [Music] right and to think of every scar every bruise every cut every piece of his beard that was pulled out every time he was whipped every time he fell and his knees hit the ground as

me Hall it's overwhelming oh thank you [Music] Father I'll get it together in a second I promise it really does overwhelm me amen it's an honor to be in the house of God with you it's an honor to be behind this pull pit again brother wendor trusting us to have a word from the Lord amen uh if you have your Bibles let's go to Genesis 32 actually I'm sorry let's go to 31 and 11 I'm going to do this the new way and do it actually off my iPad for a change so you all forgive me uh I'm not real sophisticated at least that's what my kids see so praise the Lord uh well they they say you need to learn something new every day right that that's what they say praise the Lord but it truly is an honor to be in the house of God because you know there is one day that it's not going to happen there's going to come a day when the doors are closed and you're not going to be able to have meat to eat so let's honor this day and let's rejoice in this day and let's be happy to go to the house of God because I believe the scripture says I was happy when they called unto me right let us go to the house of the Lord because one day it won't be Genesis 3111 to 13 and the angel of God spake unto me in a dream saying Jacob and I said here am I and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the Rams which leap upon o i missed some of that let me find it I see I used an iPad Kaye all right 31 and 11 sorry forgive me brothers and sisters and the angel of God spake unto me in a dream saying Jacob and I said here am I and he said said lift up now thine eyes and see all the Rams which leap upon the cattle or rings strik speckled and grizzled for I have seen all that laan doeth unto thee I am the god of bethl where thou anointest the pillar and where thou bowest a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred get thee out of this land and go back to where you came from I like that I like that and then Genesis 32 and one and Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host and he called the name of that place Mahna a aim mahannah aim we'll use that one thank the Lord let's just go to him dear heavenly father Lord we're so thankful to be in your house and Lord I'm a little nervous I my wife's not here and she gets me all ready and takes care of me father so I'm but I know you have all things in control and there is no coincidence in this life Lord so we trust that you're know what you're doing and that you're here because you promised it father God you've never failed me you never failed me you've never never failed anyone in this building you've never failed anyone that in your bride you can't fail and you said you would be here and we're trusting in you and we're believing it father so Lord we ask you to take us out of the way and step in and speak to your people give them Words of Life in Jesus name thank you y'all can be seated I do get a bit nervous sometimes and especially when I'm excited and tonight I'm excited because after that sermon this morning my goodness how could we not be excited right I mean we're Overcomers and and the crazy part of it is is we've already done it now I mean because we've already seen the end of the book so we already know we made it so we're already there so wow amen amen but in this story of Jacob a little thought came to me and I was studying on it and I've been studying on it for a while and then when the call came I went ahead and and tried to put it together and then after this morning I was like Wow and then you all get up here and sing all these songs and I was like okay cuz the title of my sermon tonight if I had one is seek and you'll find so uh that's uh the title and now let's see if we stick to it right but seek and you'll find yeah so Jacob's in another land another place in his life Believe It or Not of his own choosing okay he was there because he was a a Shyer he was a liar a cheat a thief he literally stole Esau's blessings right now this is the guy that's going to Father the tribes of Israel and he stole his blessings all right right yeah now I'm not sitting up here telling you to go steal something that ain't that ain't what I'm trying to say what I'm saying is is he ended up in this land Yeah by his own choices right he ended up in this land because he put himself there had he followed the rules I want to say that again had he followed the rules Esau would have gotten the Earthly blessing but he still would have got the Heavenly blessing God plans this out and he has it and he knows what's going to happen and he's not going to change it all right okay but you see Jacob was like one of the greatest he had a drive to succeed yeah he had a drive to be the best he had the drive to have everything so much so that when they were born he was trying to pull Esau back in so he could get out first and if that ain't competitive I don't know what is right he wanted to be first he had a drive he had something in him that said I am the firstborn I am the son of my father I am the blessing right this is my mine and there was something in him that said I'm going to take it it's mine come on and he didn't go to prayer he didn't go to God and say well God how are you planning on doing this because I know my calling Moses was the same way he's like I know my calling and he ends up murdering somebody all right he knew his calling in his heart his calling was to be the father of the tribes of Israel so he went about to make sure that happened and he was blessed oh he was blessed we're going to go in the scriptures and I'm going to tell you how much he was blessed here in just a minute because for back then he had a lot of stuff he had a lot of material stuff God blessed him with everything he touched and when somebody tried to him God showed him how to fix it somebody said no this ain't going to work God showed him because he was the Seed of Abraham he was going to be blessed but oh all the wrong way but God still blessed him because that's God's word God said seek and you'll find That's the Law that's the rule that's where it is so he's I want it and he went after it and brother he got it that's the word of God all the way up until he can no longer stay because he has outstayed his welcome at laan's house now he's already outstayed his welcome at home now he's outstay is welcome at laan's house he has nowhere to go and God says finally and he goes down to him get up and go home yeah he's like go home God said yes go home I got this I'll take care of it I'm going to bless you you're going to have seed and it's going to be this and God did God said I'm going to bless you you're going to be fine go home come on so he said okay and he gathers everybody up because he knows if he stays he's in trouble I mean he just took all the laban's cattle don't don't you see the pattern he done took all the I mean he couldn't have stayed if he wanted to so God said all right you got to go but you're going home you're going back to where you came from but you got to remember where we came from right Jacob didn't come from a lineage of sneaks and cheats he came as the Seed of Abraham which was God's seed so he came from God so God said go home come back to me come back to righteousness come back to the word come back to where I will bless you right and I will bless you when you get there I will your seed will run just like I promised Abraham everything will be there it'll be for you go home come back and so Jacob followed what God Said and he took off now there was one time in this that God had a son and he told him go and take care of the the garden and all this and I'm going to rest and and and I'll meet you over here in the evening and he shows up there and Adam wasn't there he's like huh so he goes running all around Adam where are you Adam where are you of course you all know that story he's over there hiding because he messed up so he said all right I'm going to send my angels to meet this one but guess what he followed the word of the Lord he was on his way home and he met the host of Heaven Come on all right right where he was supposed to be on his way home okay praise the Lord and the angel of the god spake unto me and said go home and then when Jacob done that the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host okay he knew who it was there was no doubt in his mind and then he got this bright idea to send some Scouts ahead to go see what it looks like and smooth everything over with Esau so he could just slide right back in right so he sends them over there and they come back and said well he sure is happy to see you and he's coming with 400 men Jacob was like oh my he's like well how about that so here he is exactly where God told him to be exactly where the host of Heavens met him in the line of his duty at the time which was to get home and he's standing there protected surrounded God even showed him the host of heaven and he got scared he got scared brother window he got tempted he got scared so he decides once again to take everything in his own hands he says we're going to split this up and I want half of my people over there and I want half of them over here that way per chance he takes that half this half Will Survive now the question of the day is which one was he going to be in is he going to wait until he sees if that one's destroyed and hi tell it to that one I mean he is a shyer right so what was he planning on doing while the two of them was getting whatever you know because you got the problem is he split it in two I mean come on this is Jacob he's a Shyer you know he split it in two one to send to Esau and one to send to Laban while he snuck out through the woods you know that's what he was doing at least that's what I got out of it other otherwise I mean he was saving his own skin that's what he was doing but but it was it was actually the pressure of the moment I think that got under his skin he was looking at this servant guy who told him 400 men was coming and he didn't believe he could honestly tell him that everything was going to be okay and the pressure of it got too much and he just started doing things on his own again again he was doing stuff on his own that got him in this predicament to start with by the way I don't like doing things on my own because I mess it up too Jacob is one of the closest people in the Bible to me other than Peter so and the messenger returns to Jacob saying we came to thy brother Esau and also he cometh to meet thee in 400 men with him then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands and said if Esau come to one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape and then Jacob went and prayed he made his choices he made his decisions and then he went and done everything and then he went and prayed backwards and Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the Lord which said is unto me all right I love that he's like all right I've made all my decisions and I've done everything and I've got this the way I think it ought to be but Lord you told me you told me you saidst unto me return unto thy country you saidst unto me to go to the country and thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee now he's seeking for a good outcome of his decision okay you see God already told him what to do and he's in the middle of doing it but he didn't really trust how he was doing it so he went and made a bunch of decisions moved everything around and then went back to God and said now you said this was going to turn out all right so everything that I've done should be fine because you said split them all up and I done all this because you said you said we're going to get there then he said and Lord you said you would deal well with me he said I'm not worthy here we go now he's getting somewhere and I'm not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou has showed unto thy servant for with my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I am become two bands see he's admitted now that he's separated there's two of them instead of one of them United they might have could have fought divided they had no chance none okay and now I am become two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children I love this he throws the women and children in before God as well he's like you know help me Lord uh for them but help me Lord for them after he's already messed it up divided his forces yeah I mean he's done and now he's like Lord you know help me for them and thou sest he's doing it again and thou sest I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude see now he's bringing it right back again to the women and children because without the children wears the seed so he's reminding God you can't let him take my kids either I I know I messed this up I know I separated it but God you said you said and then he lodged there that night okay and he took that which he had to his hand at the present this is what he had 200 she goats 20 he goats 200 oo Hughes o however youd say that 20 Rams 30 camels with their Colts 40 kind 10 Bulls 20 donkeys and 10 fos and he delivered them into the hands of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betx drove and drove and he commanded the foremost saying when Esau my brother meth thee and askest thee saying who art thou and whether goest thou and who are the before thee then Thou shalt say they be thy servant Jacob's now he's his servant he cheated him out of his Birthright cheated him out of his Blessing but now he's a servant okay they be thy servant Jacob's it is a present sent unto me unto my Lord Esau and behold also he is behind us and so commanded he the second and the third and all the following the drove saying on this manner shall ye speak to Esau and say ye more moreover Behold thy servant Jacob is behind us for he said I will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward I will see his face per Adventure he will accept of me so when the present so went the present over before him and himself lodged the night in the company so basically what he was doing was taking the blessing that he stole and trying to give it back basically that's what he's doing because he took the blessing the Earthly blessing which is you know when he blessed the firstborn the firstborn gets everything the firstborn gets the cattle it gets the mules it gets everything the servants all of that so basically what he was doing was taking the blessing that he stole from Esau and is now trying to hand it back to Esau and say maybe he'll forgive me if I put him make him Rich basically okay all right so went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company but something still ain't setting right with Jacob how could it he's a child of God it wasn't his Blessing to steal and it ain't his Blessing to give away see that's the hardest part to understand I think sometimes the things God gives us isn't ours now he says be good with your money and then he says and if somebody asking you have it give it and don't even think about getting it back that's what the scripture says because it's his money do with it what he pleases so if he sends somebody to you okay you see see where I'm going if he heals you then it's for him the healing is given to you so that you in turn can be his mouthpiece the vessel he's going to use now to bring that to somebody else right because if you've been healed of heart disease your testimony has enough life in it and enough feeling in it that it brings people to go oh they've lived through this they know what this is they can help me because they have compassion and empathy for me they know what I'm going through so when God heals you and he heals your body and it's a done deal he done it before the foundation of the world and one way or another you will be healed on either on this Earth or when you step foot in your next body I mean that healing is promised to you so I firmly believe that when you're healed on this Earth it is maybe 25% for you and 75% for God because he's not done with you come on because if he was done with you and your purpose had run its course and you've done what you're supposed to do then God's going to take you home it's simple that's right well he said it I mean he says it plain as day he would shorten the time least the very elect be deceived that's what he said and I'm glad Lord come quickly it's harder and harder and harder to make it in this world than it has ever been you're out there at work and you're fighting it and you're fighting it and you're fight it and things are throw back into your face people don't even know who they are people don't even know what they are come on brother they're human beings that's what they are you can't tell them that yeah that's the truth I mean you can't tell them I I have talked to the guys at work and sometimes they listen sometimes they don't and it's kind of funny because one day we were all just sitting around talking and and next thing you know I I looked up and I got like a 20 member congregation in the middle of the warehouse and everybody just listening listening listening then finally I was like I'm going to get in trouble the boss walks out here you know so I kept talking to Marcus which is the one I was talking to and everybody else was listening and and we were just saying this and that and he was he was like yeah but I don't understand it he said I'm a Christian but I just wish I could do this he said I wish I could do that I would love to be able to do this and I said why and he he said well you know to be accepted to be a part of the group to be a part of the norm he said I would love to be able you know to go and and and have a few drinks and this and that I said yeah I said but I I don't look at it that way this is where this started now by this time I guess they're all gathering around they listening to what preach is going to say as they call me um so and they're listening I said I look at this totally different I it's not that I don't get to do anything I I it there is nothing in the law of Christ that tells me I can't do anything I don't want to do come on and he and he kind of looked at me he said but I want to I said really he said yes I said you want to go that route yes I said have you ever drank no have you ever been at those parties and seen what they're like no I was like be thankful because I can't forget them yeah come on and he was looking at me he I said it's not that you don't get to do it it's that you don't have to do it you see Jacob didn't have to split up his bands he didn't have to send them out in front of him hopefully Esau would kill all of them before it got to him Jacob jaob didn't have to do any of that all he had to do was follow what God Said and go home that's right it's all he had to do follow what God Said and go home because brothers and sisters I can promise you you don't want to go the route that I went you don't want to go the route I'm sure that brother Joel can tell you about and sister Stephanie you do not that is not fun come on all right oh it starts out maybe like it is but it never stops there because if you seek you're going to find it let's just get this out of the way if you seek for something you're going to find it true if you seek for the devil you're going to find him if you go out here and look at all this Hollywood and all the makeup and all of the clothes and everything that's going on and you're going to look at all that guess what you're going to find he's going to put it right in front of you you seek for that and you know what you're going to get you're going to get the anxiety brother you're going to get the depression you're going to get all of it because you're actually looking for it and the law of God says if you seek you'll find it if you knock on the door it's going to open that's what it says so if you go and you knock on the door of Satan's house he's going to open the door that's right don't go looking because I promise you you don't want it you don't anyways I don't know if he ever went to the party or not his wife's a good woman so he probably not but anyway they were all listen to it and of course I went into a little bit more detail you know I don't have to crawl home through my own puke I don't have to you know what I mean because that's where that stuff leads to that's right that's where it leads to Satan gets a control of you and you lose control of it that's what happens and once you lose control you swear up and down you're in control you're like oh no I got this i got this i got this no you don't the only person that's got that Satan and he's using you that's a well that that one's free so Jacob went at the prayer again and he's like Lord this is what's going on everybody SE separated he went out by itself because now he knows he's in a pickle because he messed up again again I like how you said that this morning brother you know we make mistakes we do things doesn't mean we're lost Jacob sitting there he messed up again he's like Lord we're here then all in a sudden he's wrestling with the man now now you would think he knew who it was right away because you don't just all in a sudden start wrestling with a man usually you have to find them there's some words throw back and forth and the argument here or there and then you start wrestling you don't just wake up wrestling a guy you know it doesn't work that way but it did I guess this time because he said and Jacob was left alone so he was alone and there Wrestled a man with him how could he be alone and then there Wrestled a man with him because I mean he obviously wasn't there right until the breaking of the day and when he saw that prevailed not against him now now this is the crazy part because when I first read that when I was younger I thought that meant Jacob wasn't prevailing against the man let's read it and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him so basically this man was wrestling with Jacob and couldn't beat him he was wrestling away now whether he couldn't beat him out of choice or whether he couldn't beat him out of because Jacob was tough one or the other and finally he said man you got to let me go and Jacob heard the voice and it made a a certain sound and he's like oh wait a second uh-uh now he's in seeking mode and he said nope I'm not going to let you you go till you bless me wait wait a second he was already blessed he was a rich man he had everything that you could think of he even had God's word allowing him to go home but it wasn't enough all right Jacob said I am not going to let go of you until you bless me not the one that pretended to be e es a that's living under the blessing that was Esau's that was given to him by God because we all knew who was going to be Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated but he finally said no you're going to bless me the real me the me that's out here alone praying to you God in desperation he's on his knees and Jacob is finally Jacob he's no longer pretending to be somebody he's not he's no longer dressing up as something he's not he's no longer pretending to be a Christian he's no longer pretending to be a Son of God he's no longer pretending to be a firstborn he's no longer pretending he even remotely deserves the blessings that he got and he's like I am not going to let go of you now he's in seek mode he realized he has his hands on the body of God and he says I am not going to let go of you until you bless me the broken me the messed up me not the Blessed guy that looks like he has everything that pretends he's the man that pretends everything's going great that pretends like is good that pretends he has no problems yeah because he had a lot of problems he said Lord I need you to bless me and God said I can't do that unless you let go let go of what it wasn't let go of God it would let go of himself he had to let go of the pretense on he had to let go of the untruth he had to let go of everything that he held dear he had to seek for the truth he had to find the truth in himself and that truth was I'm a thief I'm a liar and believe it or not every single one of us are yeah when you take that moment that should have been God's and put it to something else you stole God's time on it's the truth wasn't your time to give up that one's free it had to come back to who Jacob was because immediately God said okay but what's your name I bet in his mind he was thinking do I say Esau I mean that's how I got my blessings the first time he's like no I'm Jacob and God said I know but I'm going to call you Israel because I keep my word and I told you you were going to be the prince and I told you you were going to Father the Nations I told you that the tribes were coming I told you to go home that I was going to take care of you I told you all this so but for you to believe it I now must call you Israel so every time you say your name it brings about Faith because now he's hearing that he's Israel now he's hearing that he's the children now he's hearing that he's the every time somebody called him Israel he was hearing his nation's name all right God said that's all right but then God turned right around and tells everybody you know in the name of Abraham Isaac and Jacob Abraham one place or two maybe he said Abraham Isaac and Israel but in almost every single place God didn't call him Israel God called him Jacob but that was for you and that was for me because God remembered who Israel was God forgave him blessed him because his word done it but God said Jacob for you and me because if he can forgive that man he can forgive me amen if he can give him a new name he can give me a new name if he can give oh brother if he could give Peter a new name he can give me a new name he can give Saul the murderer of Christians a new name he can give me a new name I am no longer called a thief I am no longer called a drug addict I am no longer called an alcoholic and I will not go seeking those names back out I don't want them God pulled me out of that God took me out of that and he gave me a new name and that name was Son of God that name was Mrs Jesus Christ that's the name he gave me he gave me the name delivered he gave gave me the name redeemed he gave me the name okay okay yes okay I'm okay I'm fine Lord oh brother I know your life I know your finances don't you worry about that God's Got That under control I'm fine my name's on the Lamb's Book of Life and I'm fine my head may hurt but I'm fine all is well and you know why it's well because he changed my name to his he didn't just give me any name he didn't just pick a name he didn't call me Israel he didn't call me Abraham no he said uhuh if you overcome I'm going to bring you up here you're going to sit with me you're going to sit right beside me and to do that I'm going to make you my wife that way nobody can even say nothing about it because everybody know the wife's place is next to the husband plain and simple all right you want to know where my wife belongs with me amen now she's in Georgia right now taking care of family but that's okay because she took me with her I promise I mean you can tell by looking at me I ain't all here so that's where we belong so he changed your name he changed your identity he changed who you are and the only way he could do it was to actually physically change you yes okay the dove can lead a lamb but the dove can't lead a goat nobody can lead a goat you can push him you can hit him and you can beat him but you sure ain't going to lead him you can tie a rope around its neck and somehow or another and I know cuz my wife done milk goats for years and I would put a rope around it and I'd take off walking and some how or another that Crazy Goat would get them horns stuck in a hole that big how did it get its entire head in a hole that big when I was pulling it the opposite direction that's a goat but sheep once they get used to you and they know your voice and you go out there you don't even have to really say much if they know the sound that you're going to make you can walk out the sheep and just go here they all come feeding time I heard that I know that's certain sound o I heard my name yes I heard there's my name again o there's I'm getting closer because my name's getting louder brother wend I'm getting so close I can hear it ringing in my head time is at hand look up your Redemption is nigh your name is no longer an Earthly name your name is misses Jesus Christ and in that name Jesus Christ all things are possible amen what' he give you to fight with the word that's what he gave you to fight with right he said you go fight and I'll show you how to do it and everything he defeated he defeated by the word he gave you the word and then he gave you the authority to wield this word right he gave you the authority to take this word and stand upon it as Sons and Daughters of God God the Bride of Jesus Christ and speak a Living Word so do you realize you have the authority to direct God he was the word he is the word not that you'll actually ever direct him because you never was the Seeker of God to start with Bible say Seek and you'll find then he turned right around and said I won't lose one of them he made his own law he put his own law on the place and said if you seek you'll fine and then he said like the Lost lamb I'm going to go seek him he made the law for himself so he wouldn't lose one he said my father said I wouldn't lose one how because if I seek mine I'm going to find him because the word says right it is written seek and you shall find so how can he lose one his own word says if he'll seek he'll find so yeah he's not going to lose the one so it ain't you doing the seing it ain't you doing the running it ain't even you using the authority him because if he puts it in your heart to pray for someone that's actually him seeking that person that burden that he puts upon you is him seeking somebody you think you're here by chance you think you're sitting in a message Church by chance come on uhuh first he called you called you what out of that and then he chose you to sit here and then he chose you to be here and then he chose you to hear his word and then he chose you to accept his word why so he could use you his word but he is the word but you are the word but he is the word but you are the word does that make sense oh yeah he's the word you're the word the word seeks it's you you that does the seeking but it's him seek and you shall find so what is it exactly are we seeking is it riches is it Earthly things that ain't what he's seeking he said I won't lose the one of them amen so if he's seeking his bride we should be seeking his bride if that's what he's looking for that is what we should be looking for and then he said these signs shall follow them that believe so if you're doing God's work and you're the word and he's the word and you're the word and he's the word and you're all out there searching and looking and you're searching for him in spirit and in truth because you know the truth is he's the one looking for you and looking for someone else through you he's doing the seeking he's doing the searching and you just happen to be there to be a part of it at that particular moment brothers and sisters you are the word he's the word and they said come come to what a new name you don't need the old name anymore the old name is worthless it won't even get you nowhere it gets you absolutely nowhere all right you know the prodical son he was finally came to himself and realized I can be a servant my my father will do that for me and he headed home so here comes a prodical son and his dad setting up there and then the Bible says his dad saw him a far off yeah it didn't say the prodical son saw the father it didn't say that so that only meant his father had to be watching for the son yes sir and then all in a sudden the man jumps up and goes that's my son he takes off after him running after him right we we know the story and he goes running and he grabs him and like you said this morning you know brought him in gave him the robes gave him the ring gave him all that brought him back just like he never left and his brother was like well you never done that for me you never gave me the big fat cat you never had a party for me I've been here this whole time I've worked this Farm I've I've I've and he looks at him and says then you should I ask you should ask seek and you'll find and if you do it the right way these signs shall follow them that believe so if you want to know what I'm seeking for today is that name the name that he's given me let me read this to you Revelations 2: 17 he that ha a he ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving the one that receives itess Lord and then in Revelations 3 and12 him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is new Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will Rite upon him my new name amen the name of God his new name and he writes it upon you miss Jesus Christ and in that name you shall land lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in that name you can pray for people and they receive salvation in that that name you can impart the Holy Spirit not in you the bride but in the authority of the name of Jesus Christ which is the name he's given you he gave you himself he didn't give you a servant he didn't give you the neighbor he didn't give you another guy that takes up a spot of Heaven he didn't give you any other thing he gave you the greatest gift he could ever give you the greatest gift you will ever receive the greatest gift that has ever been known to man and that is he gave you him he gave you himself praise the Lord and sometimes we just throw it back oh yeah seek and you'll find you seek all the drama you seek all the negativity you you're going to get it like the brother said doesn't mean you're not saved man on man I don't want to live that way I'm going to seek a new name that's right Bible said he'd give me a new song in the night why a new song because everything about me's changed I can't sing the old songs brother because I don't relate to the old songs anymore I can't sing the old country songs because my wife loves me so she ain't cheating on me so how can I sing country songs brother how can I see rock songs I mean I don't do the alcohol and I don't do the drugs so how can I sing the rock songs because that's no longer me I can no longer sing songs about that because that's not me that's right that's where I came from but that's not me I have a new name so I should seek things that go along with that name amen and that is life that's right eternal life that should be what we seek and that is right here and by the power of the Holy Spirit it will live in your life and before you tell me it's impossible you are too late that's right because it is possible I know it's possible I can remember laying in the jail cell Lord if you just get me out of here I swear I'll never come back lord you just get me out of here I'll do everything I'll do everything then that little voice inside my ear said you better be careful what you wish for better be careful what you promise you better be careful as long as I was in there I wanted out now when I got out it might have been a little bit of a different story but it never was the same it never was the same brother Joel I made a promise in there I couldn't keep all right yeah so I come out and what did I do right back in the pig wallet brother right back into it and you know what God did grabbed me by the hair of the head pulled me up out of it kicked me in the seat of the pants throwed me on the ground right in front of my wife and said no no and from that day forward everything changed right away no slowly but surely my record got expunged completely clean not even a not even a speeding ticket brother I mean they took it all the 24-hour overnights the the it was gone completely gone I should have lost my driver's license I should but no none of that gone completely gone huh I was like well that's that's pretty amazing you know and I'm telling April and she's all excited but I got to do 15 years house arrest for this because sis probation that's basically what it is you can't leave the house until six o'clock in the morning and you'd have to be home by 11: and in any in that time they drive up and so much as a beer bottle is in your yard whether somebody threw it out or it was yours it don't matter you're going Upstate PL and simple you get a speeding ticket you're going Upstate 15 years of this is what they gave me five or three times of five years but they said they weren't going to run them all together it was five for one County five for another County and five for another County and I had to do this one and then this one and then this one so much so that last judge said this is like a domino effect I do not want to do this because if I do this and one Domino Falls they're all going to fall and I stood up and I said your honor it won't happen that's what I said he looked at me he said you'll be back here I said no sir I promise you you will never see me again and he Shrugged he said well it's what everybody's telling me to do it's okay and he signed off on it I knew I couldn't do it okay so I made PL of what was going to happen because I wasn't going back so when they come after me I made a lot of plans I I'd already been on my knees already got the okay from God everything was going to be okay cuz he let me out I mean he answered my prayer Lord if you just get me out of here he got me out of there that was a miracle in itself I mean seriously the judge is like no I don't want to do this this goes against everything I learned in school this goes against you know but no don't you see the same line as Jacob but I make up my own plans I'm GNA do this and I'm GNA do that and and I'm GNA do this and I'm gonna do that God said no you're not so he gave me April now it's the truth he did it was the love of April that made me want to live that is the truth it was God but he used April now no April wasn't trying to serve God at the time you understand we were young we were foolish we done crazy but God gave me her gave me something worth living for okay gave me something worth doing something for and then Peace by piece slowly but surely because my life wasn't just like a overnight miracle I mean it was sudden but not suddenly brother so it g PE and then all in a sudden April got saved and I'm gonna be honest with you I'm gonna do exactly what I did that night and and April forgive me but it's the truth I sat down and said Lord why I did I didn't want the don'ts brother I was raised in it I knew what it was like I was like Lord don't and and but her I was like oh praise the Lord baby praise praise the Lord you know that's my wife I love her I want her to be happy you know so and and this is the honest story I'm not cover nothing up I'm telling you the truth that was my thought pattern for years I lived my life she lived her life and we were happily married we didn't have an argument we didn't have a fight this truth we didn't have an argument we didn't have a knock down drag out fight she would come in there and say I wish you wouldn't do that now done and I'd go okay you're right I shouldn't do that it's the kids shouldn't be this way in front of them you're right okay first went was no smoking in the house then it was no smoking in the vehicles and then it was no music in the house then it was no music in the vehicles and we never argued and we never fought and she never told me not to do it you understand she never got up in my face and told me to do anything she was like well you know what brother brandham said and I'm like yeah but she's like but but you know I I I I I love it you know I love the message I'm like well I love you but I want okay I love you I'll do it Peace by peace until one day I woke up and I was like oh my goodness it's all gone except for the cigarettes that was the hardest battle I think I ever had and I think it's because God made me fight for that one the rest of them I done for her that one I done for him maybe that's the only thing I could think of because that's the truth the music went out because she asked me to didn't happen overnight the more I thought about it the more I felt bad the more I felt bad I was like oh my goodness I'm hurting her I'd see her off crying and praying in the bedroom and I just knew that it was all about me see I was seeking for the negativity so that's what I thought she's off in there she might have been praying for her family because she spent many many years on her knees for her family but every time I saw her in the there crying it was because of me and you know what it reminded me of is all the white hair on my mother and I'm like man no I don't want her to have white hair that young so music goes out but it but it but the Bible said you know that if the two are yolked together and they're okay with you being a Christian then stay together but just for chance the husband saved by the wife or the wife saved through the husband that's that's what the scriptures say because her place is by me and my place is by her come on and if you seek you'll find it you know what she wanted what she was seeking for it wasn't that I wouldn't listen to what I used to listen to that ain't what she was seeking for what she wanted was the man of the house in his position so that she could stop running it that's what she wanted because I lived my life she took care of the kids she made made the rules for the kids she took I mean she took them to church I worked and I mean I worked seven days a week 16 hours a day but she kept seeking and she kept crying and she kept Lord you promised Lord you said Lord you promised seeking looking for the right thing from what was within her the word beget the word and he here I stand was it be because of her power no was it because of her actual no but it I believe it's the authority that she had to use the word and in using the word she claimed her family I am part of that family and one day it became a big huge I mean I guess the word Epiphany to me I was a child of God the whole entire time you know how much stuff I could have saved if I had just done it when she done it because I knew I was supposed to I felt it here imagine the different life me and her could have had had I given my life to God then all right because God called me then he pricked my heart then why didn't I realize then yes I'm a child of God and go ahead and come in with my wife and we could have lived a whole different life that's what I'm asking you here today what are you seeking for seriously in your heart what are you looking for what are you seeking what do you want what do you want out of this life deep down in your heart what do you want and then check that with the word and if it matches the word you can pray for it and you can have it that's right in spirit and truth it's what the Bible says in spirit and truth you have the holy spirit inside of you you have the truth in your hand so let the truth come out your mouth and by the spirit The Authority seek that which is right and never stop never stop there is always more of God God to have there is always more people to come to God because when the last one comes in we're out we're still here we're still fighting we should still be seeking plain and simple brothers and sisters amen amen seek and you'll find but the truth of it is seek for a new name seek to be called Mr Jesus Christ seek and find out if your name's in the Lamb's Book of Life seek that which is good and these signs shall follow them that believe what signs every sign you don't search a sign the Bible says it's an adulterous generation that seeks a sign you don't want to seek out the sign seek Out The Giver of it seek the truth amen amen want to have Kaylee play if you all don't mind I'm going try to sing a song Lord willing I know it a little bit slow brothers and sisters and I'm so excited inside of me because I realized what it is inside of me that's powering me it's God himself in me through me and by me and that is so humbling that is so overwhelming yeah yeah that God so loved me he gave me yeah a thief an alcoholic he gave me eternal life he gave me the truth and the spirit to worship Him He allowed me to come to his throne he changed everything about me so much so that I even asked my wife one time I said do you even recognize any of the manual and I love my wife cuz she said I saw this guy that's a nice way of saying no I don't but in her mind she saw us as a working family in her mind she saw us in our positions so that's what she was seeking for it wasn't because I was doing things she didn't like and so no you're you're going to do what I know she wanted us to be a working breathing God-fearing God used family that's what she wanted and that's what I want and I don't want it just for me I want it for you and I don't want it just for you I want it for your parents I want it for your kids I want it for your grandparents if they're still alive I want it for your kid kids kids cuz the Bible says it's for you and your kids and your kids and your kids and your kids for so many as he'll [Music] call that's what it says you don't have to just stop because you got it because if you just stop because you got it do you have it because he seeks out his own seek brothers and sisters and you'll find it but please seek the truth amen don't seek the negative stuff don't seek what people say about you don't go looking at the bad things well I just tell you one you know cuz you go in there and now everybody can leave a comment on everything and we'll go this way one more thing and I'll hush I promise they call me and they say all sorts of stuff I walked into a house one time we were having to get together put it nicely but we we come there having to get together so I come walking in the door and I rounded the corner and I come in front of this gal and she looked at me and she jumped two foot back and said man you ought to warn somebody before you look at them with them eyes what she said it ripped me like you wouldn't believe I came help this you think I wanted this that's what my mind was thinking I completely forgot about all of the ones coming in hey John how's it going nice truck hey man I like them new Wheels hey your hair is great I for completely forgot about the 500 compliments and kept the one negative and I kept it for years you seek for it you'll find it and good luck getting rid of it takes God to get rid of it those things are real and they hurt I know they do so don't go looking for [Music] them you see all the good ones take them because that's Godly because God has all good things in store for you God gave you your hair God Gave You Satan gives gives you the negative side forget the negative and seek the truth the truth and I promise you the negative stuff that people say about you ain't the truth you are a child of God and in that alone makes you made exactly the way he wants you all you got to do is seek him out have him come into your heart and live through you and the rest will be okay that's all seek Him don't seek what man thinks the Bible says let every word out of a man's mouth be a lie so how can you take what they say against you take what God says you're beautiful you're gorgeous that's what God says you're menly Men You're God's son not only that you're his bride so how can you not be beautiful brother wend never thought I'd call a man beautiful but God's going to marry you you got to be beautiful you see the changes that it makes don't take the negative the negative holds you down that's right the negative holds you back the negative keeps you

our brother said but he made a mess out of his life and in making that mess he had lost ties with family lost ties with at all when as as as her brother was saying when he came back home Esau wanted to kill him but that didn't change the fact that he was a part of God's predestinated plan and that God loved him eternally and the scripture says before the children were even born I love Jacob Esau wasn't even a part of God's plan but Jacob the conniver Jacob the one who had his life in shambles Jacob the one that seemed like messed up was the one that God had in his mind all the way at the very beginning and they say tonight that I'm not here by accident you're not here by accident you didn't even come to this church tonight by accident God's got us here you're playing not by accident your message isn't by accident no one's sitting in this building's here by accident maybe maybe your name is Jacob and Jacob does mean conniver Jacob means supplanter maybe God's wanting to give you a new
