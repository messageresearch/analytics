[40:58] help me to get myself out of the way
[41:00] Lord and you speak to these lips of
[41:02] Clayton night father Lord May there be a
[41:04] heart to receive the word tonight we ask
[41:06] these things in your precious name amen
[41:11] in John 12 let's let's go up to the 17th
[41:14] verse John 12 and 17. the people
[41:17] therefore that was with him when he
[41:19] called Lazarus out of his grave and
[41:21] raised him from the dead bear record for
[41:24] this cause the many people also met him
[41:27] for they had heard that he had done this
[41:29] miracle and the Pharisees therefore said
[41:32] among themselves perceived ye how ye
[41:34] Prevail nothing behold the world has
[41:37] gone after him and there was a certain
[41:39] Greeks among them that come up to
[41:42] worship at the feast and the same came
[41:45] therefore to Philip which was a
[41:48] bethesita of Galilee and desired him
[41:50] saying sir we would see Jesus amen as
[41:54] the Lord blesses his word you can have
[41:56] your seats
[41:57] um if I had a simple subject tonight
[42:00] with the desire to see Jesus and I have
[42:03] been going through the the services sir
[42:05] we would see Jesus and there's so much
[42:07] in those messages if you haven't
[42:09] listened to him in a while there's
[42:11] there's a bunch of them maybe 12 I'm not
[42:13] exactly sure but there's a bunch of them
[42:15] so if you ever listen to him in a while
[42:17] I would encourage you to go and listen
[42:19] to them so that's what I'll be drawing a
[42:21] lot of tonight out of would be those
[42:23] messages but I like how the Bible puts
[42:25] it they desired to see Jesus before they
[42:29] ever found Philip before they ever ever
[42:31] came to that location the Bible says
[42:34] there were certain Greeks I like how the
[42:36] I like that word search and it's not a
[42:38] peculiar or or or or something like that
[42:41] but it's somebody that has chosen some
[42:44] uh I chose my my Loretta to be my wife
[42:47] so I chose a certain somebody it's
[42:49] somebody that I chose to live with to
[42:51] express my life with and I believe that
[42:54] God chose these Greeks a certain uh
[42:56] there's there's many people in Greece
[42:58] many people around that that part of the
[43:00] country but God chose those people in
[43:03] place of desire in their hearts that
[43:05] they would come and see Jesus and I
[43:07] believe before you can ever see Christ
[43:10] there must be a desire to see Christ but
[43:13] the the definition of Desire is too long
[43:16] or hope for the Bible says in Mark 11 24
[43:19] therefore are saying to you whatsoever
[43:21] things ye desire When you pray believe
[43:24] that you receive them and you shall have
[43:27] them so he's saying here before you ever
[43:29] come praying before you ever come asking
[43:32] you have to desire something before you
[43:35] can ask it before you can go and buy
[43:37] something go to store you have to have a
[43:39] desire to go and purchase something
[43:41] before you go to the to White so you
[43:43] need or yeah Williams if you need a loaf
[43:46] of bread before you go to the store you
[43:48] have a desire and I like how daddy
[43:50] preached a sermon the other day on on
[43:53] the need he says before the before a fan
[43:56] was created there was a need to know
[43:58] there was something how did you put
[44:00] there there was a need for the fan
[44:02] before it was recreated and I believe
[44:04] before God was ever on the earth before
[44:06] Christ ever came to the Earth there was
[44:09] a need there was a desire and I believe
[44:11] seeing the supernatural starts with the
[44:14] desire before you can pray for something
[44:16] you have have to have a desire brother
[44:18] Branham says you get so much guard on
[44:20] the inside that you can seek him
[44:22] everywhere you look see but until that
[44:25] desire to see him you won't ever see him
[44:28] he says you can see him in the Sun so
[44:30] you can you can hear him in the call of
[44:32] the bird you can watch him everywhere
[44:34] he's on every hand but the old man had
[44:37] so much of God on the inside that he
[44:39] could see God everywhere he's talking
[44:40] about the boy that he wanted to see God
[44:43] he came up to his mother and said Mama
[44:45] can anybody see God and she said Son go
[44:47] ask the preacher she goes up to the
[44:49] preacher and says preacher can anybody
[44:51] see God and he says no son nobody can
[44:54] see God and live and being disparaged he
[44:57] goes to the to the Sunday school teacher
[44:59] he says Sunday school teacher can
[45:01] anybody see God and she said no son
[45:04] nobody can see God and live and this boy
[45:07] was heartbroken why serve a God that you
[45:09] can't see why serve a God that you can't
[45:12] experience the realities of it and
[45:15] that's a good question why should the
[45:17] god that you can experience why server
[45:20] God that you can't see the power of and
[45:23] this boy was walking down the road
[45:24] brother Brandon says and he's seen a a
[45:27] fisherman setting in a boat he had tears
[45:29] coming down his face he was looking up
[45:31] at a rainbow crying and the boy ran and
[45:34] jumped you to the man's lap and said sir
[45:36] can anybody see God and he stopped and
[45:39] he said son that's all I've seen for the
[45:42] last 35 years he's gone there was a
[45:45] preacher there was a mama there was a
[45:47] Sunday school teacher all looking at the
[45:49] same Sunset looking at the same rainbow
[45:51] but they didn't have a desire to see God
[45:54] but there was an old man that had been
[45:57] through some storms that have been
[45:58] through some hard times been through
[46:00] some struggles but there was still a
[46:02] desire on the inside to see God no
[46:05] matter what he went for no matter the
[46:07] circumstance and I say this evening I
[46:10] don't care where you have if there's a
[46:12] desire to see the resurrection if
[46:14] there's a desire to see the resurrection
[46:16] their savior there's a resurrected
[46:18] Savior for you to see you can experience
[46:21] the realities of his presence you can
[46:24] experience the realities but it first
[46:27] starts with the desire you see a desire
[46:30] makes you look for something the Bible
[46:32] says you have not because you ask not
[46:34] and you don't ask because there's not a
[46:37] desire like I said you're not going to
[46:39] go to the grocery store unless there's a
[46:41] desire so it first starts with the
[46:44] desire but that desire has to be in the
[46:46] right direction you can have a desire
[46:48] for something but if that desire is
[46:51] perverted it's going to send you in the
[46:53] wrong direction and brother praying says
[46:55] that every every man is born with the
[46:58] thirst and The Thirst is to be a it's
[47:00] the first after God after his things but
[47:03] the devil would like to pervert that
[47:05] desire and push you towards the things
[47:07] of the world so even though there's a
[47:09] desire there if the devil gets a hold of
[47:12] it it's going to point you in the wrong
[47:14] direction and I believe even though you
[47:16] you have a desire to see Jesus Christ if
[47:20] you're not pointed in the right
[47:22] direction you're going to be chasing an
[47:24] imaginary thought you're going to chase
[47:26] a Creed you're going to try chase a
[47:28] Dogma but if somebody can point you in
[47:31] the right direction and say right over
[47:34] here is Christ you're no longer walking
[47:37] this way but your direction has changed
[47:40] towards that towards the desire that is
[47:44] on the inside and I love that I love the
[47:46] scripture about Philip and the eunuch I
[47:48] talked about it here before but the
[47:50] Bible says that there was a eunuch that
[47:53] was reading the scriptures Isaiah 53 he
[47:56] was reading these scriptures and the
[47:58] angel of the Lord come to Philip and
[48:00] says go to that man and as he come to
[48:02] that man he heard him reading the
[48:04] scripture and he says sir do you
[48:06] understand what you read and he says how
[48:08] can I unless a man guides me and that
[48:11] just stood out to me he was reading the
[48:13] Bible he was reading prophecy he was
[48:16] reading inspiration but without somebody
[48:19] to appoint him in the right direction
[48:21] that desire was going to lay dormant and
[48:24] I believe we had a message in this last
[48:27] day but God knew there was going to be a
[48:29] desire for you to see Jesus Christ there
[48:32] was going to be a desire for you to the
[48:35] the experience the realities of the
[48:38] Resurrection but before you can see that
[48:40] he needed something to guide you and say
[48:43] this is the direction this is the way
[48:46] this is the way you can see Jesus Christ
[48:48] and I believe this message has opened
[48:51] our eyes where we can see that Jesus
[48:54] Christ ain't something in the Tomb Jesus
[48:56] Christ ain't something of yesterday but
[48:59] he's the same yesterday today and
[49:01] forever hope and the bearing them says
[49:04] too many he says men are people getting
[49:06] in their minds that they're looking at
[49:08] for looking to what God did yesterday
[49:10] and looking for him to do something but
[49:13] fail to see what he's doing today but
[49:15] there's a message it's come and says
[49:18] your desire is right but you need
[49:20] something to guide you oh my brother
[49:23] Brandon he says in that in that message
[49:25] sir would we see Jesus he says too many
[49:27] people is living in a glare of the light
[49:30] he says that glare is a part of the
[49:32] light but it's not the light but in
[49:34] order to get out of the glare you gotta
[49:37] come to prison truth oh come on now
[49:40] before he says to the there's a lot of
[49:42] old people that is looking in yesterday
[49:44] years and putting makeup on that they're
[49:47] putting things on that are trying to
[49:49] make them look young instead of living
[49:51] in today and he says that's where many
[49:53] church members failed oh that's where
[49:56] they live is the looking of something
[49:57] yesterday instead of looking in the
[50:00] light the God gave this state what's the
[50:03] bible say that in the evening time it
[50:06] shall be light we're not looking in the
[50:08] light of yesterday we're now looking for
[50:10] a life to come but this message has has
[50:14] brought a light where we can slam it's
[50:16] pointed Us in the right direction oh my
[50:20] you see we we did a lot of traveling uh
[50:22] before we came back home I think we
[50:24] traveled over 4 000 miles I believe but
[50:27] before we can go from place to place we
[50:29] needed something to give us a direction
[50:31] even though we had a desire to go to
[50:34] South Carolina than the North Carolina
[50:36] then to Virginia than the Tennessee then
[50:39] the Kentucky we first had to have
[50:41] something give us the direction even
[50:44] though we have the desire we had we had
[50:47] the car we had gas it had a battery it
[50:49] had a spark plug it had the means to get
[50:53] us to our desire but we needed something
[50:55] to point us in the right direction and
[50:58] before we can get pointed in the right
[51:00] direction we needed to find something
[51:03] that was capable of giving us the
[51:05] direction Hallelujah I couldn't come to
[51:08] this chair and say take me to or watch
[51:11] the directions to South Carolina even
[51:13] though the shame is good it's very
[51:15] useful it has its purpose there's
[51:18] nothing in that chair that can give me
[51:20] the direction I can come to this speaker
[51:22] and say speaker give me the direction to
[51:25] Florida give me the direction to
[51:28] Indianapolis but even though the brother
[51:30] the speaker has a good purpose but it's
[51:33] not its purpose to give me a direction
[51:35] but what I needed to do was put my
[51:38] desire in my GPS come on somebody put my
[51:42] desire in my GPS then I was no longer
[51:45] guessing the way I was going there was a
[51:48] direction there was a guide that was
[51:51] telling me each turn I needed to take
[51:53] telling me you need to go 50 miles on
[51:55] this highway then you're going to turn
[51:57] left then you're going to go this way a
[51:59] certain amount of miles I found the
[52:01] direction that was fulfilling my desire
[52:04] and I believe God has given us a message
[52:07] that is fulfilling our desire we're not
[52:10] wishy-washy questions we're not hope and
[52:12] sore we're not thinking maybe so but
[52:14] there's a Direction that's been give it
[52:17] to the bride
[52:18] we can see the realities of Jesus Christ
[52:22] her mother's a Direction that's been
[52:25] given a first had to find something
[52:28] capable they've given me the direction
[52:30] and oh my you're safe man's Creeds is
[52:33] not capable of giving us the direction
[52:35] to a Rapture means ideas he's not
[52:38] capable of giving us the direction to
[52:41] the realities of Jesus Christ we needed
[52:44] something to fulfill our desire and give
[52:47] us our direction oh mine I like how the
[52:50] Bible is putting that Jesus is saying
[52:52] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[52:55] after righteousness
[52:57] so not just hungering and thirsting but
[53:00] they got something that they're
[53:02] thirsting for and the Bible says for
[53:04] they shall be filled it's a promise it's
[53:07] not a hope so but if you're thirsting
[53:10] and you're Desiring for God then you
[53:13] shall be filled you see but before you
[53:16] can recognize something you gotta
[53:18] realize you need it you see many people
[53:21] can look at this message and say it's
[53:23] nothing it's created it's men's ideas
[53:25] it's just man's theology it's just a
[53:28] just a kentuckian's words they don't
[53:30] have a need for it but for those who has
[53:33] a need for a guide for a direction you
[53:37] recognize that's what I have need of oh
[53:40] man you see us electricians we like the
[53:43] whole punch the hole punch kid you know
[53:45] their dad bought the first one I think
[53:47] that we've seen around here he bought it
[53:50] at a pawn shop for dirt cheap because
[53:52] the guy didn't know what he had if he
[53:55] knew what he had he wouldn't have gave
[53:57] it away he he didn't recognize that what
[54:00] it was meant to be used for but there
[54:02] was somebody that had a need for it
[54:05] come on now there's somebody that had a
[54:07] desire for it and since there was a
[54:09] desire for it there was something to
[54:12] recognize hey this is going to take away
[54:14] a lot of hard work oh man if you can
[54:18] just recognize that this a message is
[54:21] the direction that we need it we don't
[54:23] got to work nothing up we don't gotta
[54:26] work our way to our rapture we don't
[54:28] gotta work our way to a body change the
[54:31] desire on the inside says this is what I
[54:34] have need of
[54:35] this is what I have need of oh my but
[54:39] before the hole punch hit we already you
[54:42] saw we got to use whole sauce and
[54:44] sometimes the holes would get walled out
[54:46] and it would be too big we need WD-40
[54:48] and there'll be shavings everywhere but
[54:50] there was something that was invented
[54:52] that would fulfill the desire and God
[54:55] has sent something to layer to share
[54:57] that would fulfill the decided the
[55:00] desire But first you have to hunger and
[55:03] first for it first you've got to
[55:05] understand and realize that you have
[55:08] need of it you look at Revelations one
[55:10] and three blessed is he that readeth for
[55:13] they that hear the words of this
[55:14] prophecy and keep those things which are
[55:17] therein for the time is at hand blessed
[55:20] is he that readeth and invade that
[55:23] heareth you see the blessing is
[55:25] realizing that this prophecy is what I
[55:28] have need of I'm not just reading it but
[55:31] I'm hearing the words I'm understanding
[55:34] the words I'm putting yet hang to action
[55:37] you look down Luke 8 and 4. and much
[55:40] people were gathered together and when
[55:42] and will come to him out of every city
[55:45] and he's speak by a parable so there was
[55:48] an attraction that was gathering all of
[55:51] these people together but once they
[55:53] heard the parable there was no desire to
[55:57] see the revelation of the parable but
[55:59] there was somebody's there were some
[56:01] disciples that stopped him and says hang
[56:04] on a second what does this mean
[56:07] you go to the eighth verse and the Bible
[56:10] says A sower he's speaking of the
[56:12] parable A sower went out thy soul to sow
[56:15] his seed and he sowed some fell by the
[56:18] wayside and was trotting down and the
[56:20] founders of the air devoured it some
[56:22] fell upon a rock and as soon as as soon
[56:25] as they were sprung up it wilted away
[56:27] because of lack of moisture and some
[56:30] fell among the thorns and the Thorns
[56:32] sprang with it and it choked it out and
[56:34] other fell on good ground and sprang it
[56:37] up and Barefoot a hundred-fold and when
[56:40] he said these things he cried out he
[56:42] that happened ear to hear Let Him hear
[56:45] so he throws it out he that has a desire
[56:49] to hear this prophecy let him hear it
[56:52] but they turned away and there was no
[56:55] desire but the next verse says and his
[56:57] disciples asked him saying what might
[57:00] this Parable be they didn't turn around
[57:03] and leave Jesus there was a desire
[57:06] saying what's you you got is the
[57:08] revelation
[57:10] come on now you might not understand
[57:12] this message yet but if there's a desire
[57:15] on the inside you can't turn away you
[57:18] know there's something in this message
[57:20] that is calling doubts through the dis
[57:23] to the desire the desire the next verse
[57:26] and Jesus says and he said unto you it
[57:29] is given to know the mysteries of the
[57:31] kingdom of God but to others in Parables
[57:34] that sing they might not see hearing
[57:37] they might not understand but then he
[57:40] stops and he says this so plainly now
[57:42] the parable is this the seed is the word
[57:46] of God so he's speaking the parable to
[57:49] the ones that has no desire but then he
[57:52] stops it says since you're asking since
[57:55] you're seeking since there's a desire
[57:57] this is the parable this is the
[58:00] Revelation we're no longer guessing who
[58:03] Jesus Christ is the Revelation has been
[58:06] made known to the ones that has a desire
[58:09] the ones that is shaking brother Branham
[58:12] says Christ only reveals himself to the
[58:15] ones that is looking at looking for him
[58:17] his first has to be a desire oh my you
[58:20] looked at uh II Chronicles 9 and 12. hey
[58:23] King Solomon gave to the Queen of Sheba
[58:26] all her desire all of her desires she he
[58:30] started to give to her and when I love
[58:32] about the story is there was something
[58:34] on the inside of the Queen of Sheba
[58:37] before she ever left her a land before
[58:39] she ever left her home there was a
[58:42] desire to see a living God no doubt
[58:45] there was there was many gods in her
[58:46] lands there was many prophets there was
[58:49] many holy men there was many prophecies
[58:51] there was many of these things but that
[58:54] still did not fulfill the desire that
[58:57] was on the inside but the Bible says she
[59:00] started to hear the fame of Solomon she
[59:03] started to hear of a supernatural God in
[59:06] another in another land and you notice
[59:09] what she did she was willing to give up
[59:11] everything to go and fulfill the desire
[59:15] oh come on now if you're not willing to
[59:18] give up everything to find Jesus Christ
[59:21] you're never going to find him but if
[59:23] you're willing to give up everything to
[59:26] lay down creature to lay down Traditions
[59:28] to lay down ideas then watch that watch
[59:31] God leads you to himself that you can
[59:33] fulfill what he placed on the inside on
[59:37] my first Kingston and one and when the
[59:39] Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of
[59:41] Solomon concerning the name of the Lord
[59:44] she came to prove him with hard
[59:47] questions
[59:48] hey she didn't come to play she says if
[59:50] this is of God I'm going to ask some
[59:53] questions I'm going to share if this is
[59:56] of God or not and before she ever asked
[59:59] the questions Solomon started to reveal
[1:00:01] the answers come on now that was a
[1:00:04] supernatural God revealing himself to
[1:00:07] somebody that had a calling on the
[1:00:10] inside and if there's something on the
[1:00:12] inside that is wanting to save Jesus
[1:00:15] Christ of today there's Jesus Christ on
[1:00:18] Earth waiting for you to come and look
[1:00:20] for him
[1:00:21] I say you don't gotta look any longer
[1:00:23] the word Jesus Christ has been revealed
[1:00:26] for you to see him if there's a desire
[1:00:29] on the inside to search for him oh my
[1:00:33] God the Bible says in Matthew 12 and 42
[1:00:36] and the queen of the South shall rise up
[1:00:39] in the Judgment with this generation and
[1:00:42] shall condemn it for she come from the
[1:00:44] other most parts of the earth to hear
[1:00:46] the wisdom of Solomon and behold a
[1:00:50] greater than Solomon is here she was
[1:00:53] willing to forsake everything but the
[1:00:56] Branham says she went across the desert
[1:00:58] not in a train not in a in a car not in
[1:01:02] an airplane but she went on a camel in
[1:01:05] order to find the in order to find a
[1:01:08] living God hey simple and the Bible says
[1:01:11] that she's going to judge the generation
[1:01:13] because a greater than Solomon is here
[1:01:17] that was just a man with a gift but in
[1:01:20] this day we've Jesus Christ not a man
[1:01:23] not a guest not a personality but the
[1:01:26] person the word Jesus Christ is here a
[1:01:30] greater than Solomon is here hey is
[1:01:33] still held a sick he can still feel with
[1:01:35] the Holy Ghost he can still deliver he
[1:01:38] can still set free he can still give you
[1:01:40] a joy he can still give you a peace a
[1:01:43] greater than Solomon is here but are you
[1:01:46] willing to forsake it all to go and find
[1:01:49] him
[1:01:50] oh my brother put him gives a drama he
[1:01:54] says they're her priest which say oh no
[1:01:56] that's just Fanatics over there don't go
[1:01:58] over there and look but she wasn't going
[1:02:00] to let the doubt the Skeptics the
[1:02:03] naysayers keep her from seeing a living
[1:02:05] God oh come on now we got too many
[1:02:08] people that has a desire but they're
[1:02:10] letting what other people say keep them
[1:02:13] from seeing Jesus Christ but if you can
[1:02:16] push past it all and press and press to
[1:02:20] a revelation you won't leave the same
[1:02:22] way that you did that you came in and
[1:02:26] the Bible says in Philippians 3 and 13.
[1:02:29] brother I count not myself to have
[1:02:31] apprehended but there's one thing I do
[1:02:34] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:02:37] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:02:40] which are before this was the Queen of
[1:02:42] Sheba that did this very thing she
[1:02:45] forgot the things that was behind her
[1:02:48] and she started to press to the mark
[1:02:50] rest towards the calling oh come on now
[1:02:54] if there's a calling on the inside
[1:02:55] there's something to fulfill that
[1:02:58] calling but first you got to know where
[1:03:00] to look you got to know where the
[1:03:03] brother Branham says if you don't know
[1:03:05] what you're looking for how can you find
[1:03:07] him you remember when Joseph and Mary
[1:03:09] they left Jesus in Jerusalem the Bible
[1:03:12] says they realize that Jesus was missing
[1:03:14] and they stop and they looked for Jesus
[1:03:17] among Kinfolk and acquaintances
[1:03:21] they had a desire to find Jesus but they
[1:03:24] didn't know what to look come on now in
[1:03:27] order for them to find Jesus they had to
[1:03:29] change their Direction and say he's not
[1:03:31] here and if he's not here he must be
[1:03:34] somewhere come on now if you've looked
[1:03:37] for Christ in Traditions if you've
[1:03:40] looked for Christ and preached if you've
[1:03:42] looked for Christ in men's ideas and you
[1:03:45] haven't found him yet he's got to be
[1:03:47] somewhere he's got to be somewhere don't
[1:03:50] don't quit don't stop looking for Christ
[1:03:52] for he is here in the power of his
[1:03:55] resurrection through the form of his
[1:03:58] word saying come unto me all ye that are
[1:04:01] leather that are heavy burden I will
[1:04:03] give you rest but first there has to be
[1:04:06] a desire hope this is okay this evening
[1:04:07] but once they change their Direction
[1:04:10] they can find Jesus but you notice the
[1:04:13] closer they got to Jesus there was other
[1:04:16] influences that started to rise up and
[1:04:19] tried to change their Direction because
[1:04:21] you notice whenever she found Jesus she
[1:04:24] says Jesus your father and I have
[1:04:27] searched for you with many tears and
[1:04:29] right there brother Branham says she
[1:04:31] denied the Virgin birth because she was
[1:04:35] trying to impress the priests she didn't
[1:04:38] want to look crazy by saying that he you
[1:04:41] know that was a virgin birth but she
[1:04:43] says this is your father and right there
[1:04:45] she scarred her testimony because of the
[1:04:49] alma because of the influences around
[1:04:51] her the closer she got to Jesus the
[1:04:55] stronger the influences God and let me
[1:04:57] say this the closer you get to Jesus the
[1:05:00] closer so you get to the revelation of
[1:05:02] who he really is influences or going to
[1:05:05] try to turn you away influences it's
[1:05:09] going to try to turn you another
[1:05:10] Direction but keep pressing keep
[1:05:13] pressing in the right direction
[1:05:17] because on the other side of the press
[1:05:19] is Jesus on the other side of the press
[1:05:22] is the reality of the desire that is on
[1:05:26] the inside
[1:05:27] but you got to know where to look
[1:05:29] brother Branham says how would you go to
[1:05:31] hunt for a pumpkin and you never seen
[1:05:33] one before and never heard of one he
[1:05:36] says how would you go to find a
[1:05:37] watermelon if you never know there was
[1:05:40] such a thing and how it looks why why
[1:05:43] you can find a tub and think it was a
[1:05:45] watermelon you can find something else
[1:05:47] you can find a block and think it was a
[1:05:50] watermelon but you got to know what
[1:05:52] you're looking for
[1:05:54] I can say this hanky is a watermelon but
[1:05:57] if you don't know what a watermelon is
[1:05:59] you're going to believe me and the Bible
[1:06:02] says in Colossians 2 and 8 beware lest
[1:06:05] any man spoil you through through the
[1:06:08] philosophy and vain deceit after the
[1:06:12] tradition of men after the rudiments of
[1:06:16] the world and not after Christ so if you
[1:06:19] don't got something that is guiding you
[1:06:22] to Christ any tradition any idea any
[1:06:25] Creed can turn you away after the
[1:06:28] traditions of men but I'm not worried or
[1:06:32] I'm not concerned about traditions of
[1:06:34] men I'm wanting to find Jesus I'm not
[1:06:37] worried about what other people are
[1:06:39] saying I want to see Jesus and if that
[1:06:42] is your attitude tonight Hanukkah what
[1:06:45] they think of me I don't care what they
[1:06:47] say about me I want to see Jesus
[1:06:51] there's a desire on the inside that is
[1:06:53] wanting to see Jesus
[1:06:55] oh man the Bible for the praying him
[1:06:58] says they're looking and don't know what
[1:07:00] they're looking for because they've got
[1:07:02] their own conception of what they're
[1:07:04] trying to find and how would you know
[1:07:06] what to find if you didn't know what you
[1:07:09] was looking for he says they don't know
[1:07:11] what to find because they've got the
[1:07:13] wrong conception and that's what the
[1:07:16] Bible says to be aware of unless a man
[1:07:18] in philosophy and vain deceit point you
[1:07:21] towards their traditions instead of of
[1:07:24] Christ but I believe if you can ever get
[1:07:26] a revelation of Jesus Christ through
[1:07:29] this message you're not going to be
[1:07:31] pointed in another Direction you see the
[1:07:34] counterfeit don't take the value of the
[1:07:37] genuine away but it increases the value
[1:07:40] of it because the more counterfeit
[1:07:42] dollar bills there are the more valuable
[1:07:44] the genuine dollar bill is and there's
[1:07:47] many counterfeits out there this Towner
[1:07:49] fits that man's ideas and traditions but
[1:07:51] that's just making the revelation of
[1:07:54] Jesus Christ the more valuable hey and
[1:07:58] the more hard to find
[1:08:00] you notice I I know we've given this
[1:08:03] example many times but unless you don't
[1:08:05] got the light to shine on the
[1:08:07] counterfeit you're not going to know the
[1:08:09] difference you know when you go to a
[1:08:11] store and you buy something and you give
[1:08:13] a hundred dollar bill what's the first
[1:08:15] thing they do they put it up in the
[1:08:17] light and that light exposes it either
[1:08:20] for the genuine or for a counterfeit and
[1:08:23] before the lights ever exposes it it's
[1:08:26] got a purchasing power
[1:08:28] it's got a power to purchase until it's
[1:08:32] exposed that once it's exposed it loses
[1:08:35] its power it loses its Authority amends
[1:08:39] trades and traditions has a purchasing
[1:08:41] power over you until it's exposed by the
[1:08:45] light and the message has exposed
[1:08:48] Traditions it's exposed Creeds and says
[1:08:51] it's the work of the devil but the
[1:08:53] genuine is here
[1:08:54] the crates and the Traditions didn't
[1:08:57] push the word out of the picture it's
[1:09:00] just made it more valuable if you can
[1:09:02] see it
[1:09:03] oh my so what happens after you give a
[1:09:06] counterfeit they say no this is the
[1:09:08] counterfeit this ain't going to work
[1:09:10] here there's no Authority behind it
[1:09:12] there's no purchasing power behind it
[1:09:14] and it's refused and you know brother
[1:09:16] Branham says that the devil has no real
[1:09:19] power he says it's just a it's a
[1:09:22] perversion of the power of God but then
[1:09:25] he says but it is a power it's not a
[1:09:28] real power but it still has the power if
[1:09:31] it's not exposed hey come on now I said
[1:09:35] that's still a power until it's exposed
[1:09:38] and once it's exposed it loses its hold
[1:09:42] and I believe there's a bride without
[1:09:44] spot or with our wrinkle because the
[1:09:46] power The Works of the enemy has been
[1:09:49] exposed by the revelation of Jesus
[1:09:52] Christ
[1:09:53] oh my you see we got to make sure we're
[1:09:56] Guided by the by the genuine not by the
[1:09:59] counterfeit you look at Ecclesiastes 11
[1:10:01] and 3. if the clouds be full of rain
[1:10:04] make empty themselves upon the Earth and
[1:10:07] if the tree fall toward the South or
[1:10:09] toward the North in the place where the
[1:10:11] tree falleth there it shall be in other
[1:10:14] words if the direction of the tree is
[1:10:17] falling this way it's not going to land
[1:10:20] here if it's falling this way it's not
[1:10:23] going to land here so in other words the
[1:10:26] direction that the tree is falling is
[1:10:29] where the destination of it's going to
[1:10:31] be oh come on now we can expect our
[1:10:34] destination to be the realities of Jesus
[1:10:38] Christ if the following the direction of
[1:10:41] Maine's ideas and traditions hey I'm
[1:10:44] preaching now we can't expect us to be
[1:10:47] going this way if we're driving that way
[1:10:49] the message come to pull you out and say
[1:10:53] no that is the counterfeit but the
[1:10:56] genuine is here if there's a desire to
[1:11:00] see it
[1:11:01] oh we gotta know the direction we got to
[1:11:04] know what we're looking for brother
[1:11:06] Branham says we got to know what we're
[1:11:08] looking for for Christ he says if you're
[1:11:10] looking for somebody with nail prints in
[1:11:12] their hands anybody can do that he says
[1:11:15] any hypocrite can ever Crown of Thorns
[1:11:17] have straps on its back but you don't
[1:11:20] find Christ by the outward appearance of
[1:11:23] a man you don't find him in the garments
[1:11:25] he says he says overseas he's been
[1:11:27] places where there's many there's dozens
[1:11:29] of certified nails that was crucified
[1:11:33] that held Christ to the Cross he says
[1:11:36] How can there be dozens when there was
[1:11:38] only three
[1:11:39] he says everybody's got the Revelation
[1:11:41] everybody but there's only three so he
[1:11:45] says if you're looking for Christ in the
[1:11:47] garments if you're looking for Christ in
[1:11:50] the flesh you're going to fail to find
[1:11:52] him but you've got to find him in the
[1:11:55] living realities of what he was in the
[1:11:58] Bible
[1:11:59] Almighty says in order to find him today
[1:12:01] you gotta find him of yesterday for he's
[1:12:04] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:12:07] and forever he says the way he acted in
[1:12:11] the Bible is what is the way he's acting
[1:12:13] today you look at Matthew 24 and 24 for
[1:12:17] this shall arise false Christ and false
[1:12:20] prophets and shall show great signs and
[1:12:22] wonders in so much if it were possible
[1:12:25] they shall deceive the very elect so
[1:12:29] it's the word that identifies the
[1:12:31] counterfeit because this false prophets
[1:12:34] this false Christ that is rising up and
[1:12:37] showing great things but if wasn't for
[1:12:40] the word identifying the true from the
[1:12:43] false we want to know what to look for
[1:12:45] but thank God for the word that says no
[1:12:48] Christ ain't in a tradition but Christ
[1:12:51] is right here in his word you look at
[1:12:54] Matthew 24 and 28 for wheresoever the
[1:12:57] carcass is where the Eagles will be
[1:13:00] gathered together so the same time that
[1:13:03] those false christs are rising up and
[1:13:06] deceiving many there's another group
[1:13:08] that's being attracted to the carcass
[1:13:11] which is the word there's a desire on
[1:13:14] the inside that's not attracted to the
[1:13:17] false Christ the false prophets but
[1:13:20] there's something on the inside that is
[1:13:22] longing for Jesus Christ sir we desire
[1:13:26] do we receive Jesus Christ
[1:13:31] you notice he didn't go straight to
[1:13:33] Jesus he went to somebody that knew
[1:13:36] Jesus he needed somebody I hope your
[1:13:38] hope is making sense tonight he come to
[1:13:40] Philip he knew Philip had been with
[1:13:43] Jesus so he knew if I can just get to
[1:13:45] this one he can take me like hell our
[1:13:48] pastor was bringing it out Sunday men
[1:13:50] don't like being led by men but that's
[1:13:53] the way God orchestrated him was a man
[1:13:55] to be led by men
[1:13:57] brother Branham says if God wanted the
[1:14:00] rocks to preach he would have the Rocks
[1:14:02] preach if he wanted the birds to preach
[1:14:04] he would have the birds preach but he
[1:14:07] called man to preach he called man to
[1:14:10] reveal the revelations of Jesus Christ
[1:14:12] and so the Greeks came to Philip and
[1:14:15] said show us Jesus I know you've been
[1:14:18] with him
[1:14:19] I know you've been with him there's
[1:14:21] something different about you show us
[1:14:24] Jesus
[1:14:25] you see so the attraction of the Bride
[1:14:27] is always the word brother Branham says
[1:14:30] what God is never changes he can't say
[1:14:32] one thing and then change his mind he
[1:14:35] can't do one thing then change his
[1:14:37] opinion or change his idea he says
[1:14:39] whenever God said he can he would only
[1:14:41] accept the blood sacrifice when he loses
[1:14:44] when he refused Cain he says that's the
[1:14:46] way it's always going to be he can never
[1:14:48] change his mind but then he says if a
[1:14:51] man is healed according to his faith
[1:14:54] then the next one that comes with faith
[1:14:57] he's got to heal him because it's on the
[1:14:59] same basis of their Revelation so if
[1:15:03] somebody in here is going to revelation
[1:15:04] of Jesus Christ because they they've
[1:15:08] seen him in this message that means he's
[1:15:10] not going to change if there's somebody
[1:15:12] else that's got a craving to see Jesus
[1:15:15] he's not going to change his way
[1:15:19] but you see the only way to identify him
[1:15:21] today is to see what he did yesterday
[1:15:23] and that's only through the Bible and
[1:15:26] not believe that the Bible has got to be
[1:15:28] the direction we've got to learn how
[1:15:30] ideas our opinions everything that we
[1:15:32] think and believe goes right back to the
[1:15:34] Bible you look at John 1 and 1 in the
[1:15:37] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:15:40] God and the Word was God then you come
[1:15:42] down to the 14th verse and the Word was
[1:15:45] made flesh and so the word didn't change
[1:15:48] when it come into flesh the actions of
[1:15:51] the word come inside of the flesh body
[1:15:54] Jesus Christ to prove to the world that
[1:15:57] the word was on the Earth
[1:15:59] come on now then whenever Christ was
[1:16:02] crucified and went back to back to
[1:16:04] heaven the word still didn't change the
[1:16:07] words still it did not change and you
[1:16:10] see the entire chapter of John is pretty
[1:16:12] incredible I started studying some event
[1:16:15] here here recently and it's a good
[1:16:17] chapter the first chapter of John but
[1:16:19] the Bible says that John the Baptist he
[1:16:21] seen Christ and said Behold the Lamb of
[1:16:24] God he was sent there to Proclaim and
[1:16:27] announce that Jesus Christ was coming to
[1:16:30] the Earth but you notice how his
[1:16:33] Direction changed it went from he is
[1:16:35] coming to Now Behold he is here he was
[1:16:39] in Christ himself there was many people
[1:16:41] that come up there that come up to John
[1:16:43] and says are you the one are you the one
[1:16:46] we're looking for or where are we to
[1:16:48] look for another are we looking for the
[1:16:50] for another one and he says I'm not even
[1:16:52] worthy to loosen the shoes of the one
[1:16:55] that is coming you see so his Direction
[1:16:58] was he is coming but then all of a
[1:17:01] sudden it changed from his coming to he
[1:17:04] is here and what I love about it is
[1:17:06] whatever he says Behold the Lamb of God
[1:17:08] his disciples the ones that was
[1:17:11] following him the Bible says ran after
[1:17:13] Christ
[1:17:15] that I no longer staying with the man
[1:17:17] I'm going after Christ and that's why I
[1:17:20] don't believe in dear find the prophet
[1:17:24] I don't believe that brother praying him
[1:17:26] was Jesus Christ no sir he was strong
[1:17:28] the Baptist letting you know that Jesus
[1:17:32] is coming and now he's not just coming
[1:17:34] but he is here in the power of his
[1:17:37] resurrection to heal the sick the set
[1:17:40] free to bound to loose the captives to
[1:17:43] break down the prison bars to bind up of
[1:17:46] the brink of a to loosen up the Bruce
[1:17:48] and the ones that is in prison uh
[1:17:50] believe it here he announced that Jesus
[1:17:53] is here so the the one of the ones that
[1:17:56] ran after Christ was Andrew and the
[1:17:59] Bible says that he ran back to Peter and
[1:18:01] says Peter the Messiah is here the
[1:18:05] Christ the one we've been waiting on is
[1:18:08] here we don't got to look any longer and
[1:18:10] the Bible says that Peter ran with him
[1:18:13] to Christ and what I love about the
[1:18:15] scripture is Before Peter ever said a
[1:18:18] word Jesus turned and says this is Simon
[1:18:21] Peter this is Simon Peter the son of
[1:18:24] Jonah before he had ever seen him he
[1:18:28] started to reveal who he really was and
[1:18:31] that was a sign to Peter that this is
[1:18:34] the messiah come on now you see it
[1:18:37] wasn't the garments that revealed to
[1:18:39] Peter that the Messiah was here it was
[1:18:42] the revealing of the word it was
[1:18:44] prophecy that was being revealed that
[1:18:47] opened up his eyes you look at
[1:18:49] Deuteronomy 18 and 15 the Lord thy God
[1:18:52] shall rise up rise up unto thee a
[1:18:55] prophet from the midst of thee of the
[1:18:58] Brethren like unto me and unto him ye
[1:19:02] shall hearken and what's the Bible
[1:19:04] saying Hebrews 4 and 12 for the word of
[1:19:07] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[1:19:09] than any two Rich sword piercing even to
[1:19:12] the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit
[1:19:14] and of the joints and Mora and there's a
[1:19:17] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:19:20] the heart so what's a discerner is the
[1:19:23] word and the bus the bible say that the
[1:19:26] word of the Lord come to prophets and so
[1:19:28] this was a revelation to Peter but the
[1:19:32] word of the Lord is on Earth if he is
[1:19:35] proving the signs of the Messiah he was
[1:19:38] no longer looking but the actions of
[1:19:42] Jesus was manifesting the revelations of
[1:19:46] the scripture oh and I believe that the
[1:19:48] message that we got in this day is the
[1:19:51] manifesting the revelations that has
[1:19:54] been poured out in this day we don't got
[1:19:56] to look for another but we have found
[1:19:59] the one we're looking for you look at
[1:20:01] John 4 and 25 the woman saith unto him I
[1:20:05] know the Messiah cometh which is called
[1:20:08] Christ and when he has come he will tell
[1:20:11] us all things in Jesus saith unto her I
[1:20:15] speak unto thee I am he and she ran away
[1:20:19] she dropped the water parts and I've
[1:20:21] given the example before but you notice
[1:20:23] she was arguing with Jesus whenever he
[1:20:26] said give me something to drink he says
[1:20:28] she stopped and she says we've got no
[1:20:30] dealings with each other's you're a Jew
[1:20:33] I'm a Samaritan but then Jesus stops he
[1:20:36] noticed that she had a desire but she
[1:20:39] needed the right direction so he stops
[1:20:41] and he says if you knew who I was you
[1:20:44] would ask of me to drink but you notice
[1:20:47] what her excuse was her argument was
[1:20:49] you've got no buckets to get water she
[1:20:53] was arguing with what she had in her
[1:20:55] hand but after she was at the revelation
[1:20:58] of Christ was revealed the Bible says
[1:21:01] she dropped all water pots she dropped
[1:21:05] what was holding her back from seeing
[1:21:07] the Messiah and says come see a man
[1:21:10] isn't this the Christ the anointed one
[1:21:13] and maybe you're hanging on to some
[1:21:16] things that is keeping you from seeing
[1:21:18] the Christ but if you can just drop the
[1:21:21] buckets
[1:21:22] if you can disrupt the theology if you
[1:21:25] can disrupt the ideas and realize this
[1:21:27] is the Christ
[1:21:29] this is the one we're waiting on this is
[1:21:32] the Messiah Jesus Christ the same
[1:21:35] yesterday today and forever
[1:21:39] it's the Messiah
[1:21:42] hope this is okay brother Branham says
[1:21:45] there's three times there's three
[1:21:47] nationalities he says there's the
[1:21:49] Gentiles the Jews and the Samaritans and
[1:21:52] he says the the Messiah sign was
[1:21:55] revealed to the Jews then it was
[1:21:57] revealed to the the Samaritans but as
[1:22:00] never was revealed to the Gentiles until
[1:22:02] this day
[1:22:04] and so the same signs that he did with
[1:22:07] the with the Samaritan when he started
[1:22:09] to reveal the heart of the Samir the
[1:22:11] woman of the well that was the Messiah
[1:22:13] sign that was revealing to her that the
[1:22:16] sign of the Messiah is here and what he
[1:22:19] did with Nathanael remember Nathanael he
[1:22:21] was that he was under the tree and I
[1:22:23] believe it was it was Philip that ran up
[1:22:26] and says hey come see the Messiah the
[1:22:29] man of Love The Man from Nazareth and
[1:22:31] you notice he was a little skeptic he
[1:22:34] stopped and he says can any good thing
[1:22:36] come out of Nazareth he was skeptic
[1:22:39] because there was many opinions but you
[1:22:42] notice what Philip says he says come and
[1:22:44] see he didn't stop and argue with him
[1:22:47] but he says come and see the Messiah
[1:22:50] sign was just revealed to a man called
[1:22:53] Peter he says you remember Peter he says
[1:22:57] the fishermen that didn't know how to
[1:22:59] sign his name that Messiah signed was
[1:23:02] just revealed to him whenever revealed
[1:23:04] to him his heart but he says come and
[1:23:06] see and what happened as Philip come up
[1:23:10] to Jesus Jesus turned around and he says
[1:23:13] behold an Israelite with no gal and he
[1:23:16] stops and he says when have you known me
[1:23:18] he says whenever you was under the tree
[1:23:21] whenever Philip called you I saw you he
[1:23:24] says right there that was the Messiah
[1:23:27] sign being revealed to the Jews but he
[1:23:30] says it was never revealed to the
[1:23:32] Gentiles because they was never looking
[1:23:34] for the Messiah
[1:23:36] come on now David says he said the
[1:23:38] Samaritans was looking for the Messiah
[1:23:40] he says the Jews was looking for the
[1:23:43] Messiah but he says the Gentiles was
[1:23:45] never looking for the Messiah but in
[1:23:48] this day the Gentiles are now looking
[1:23:51] for the Messiah and he says the same
[1:23:54] sign that he did to Philip the same sign
[1:23:57] that he did to the woman at the well
[1:23:59] he's now dead in this generation it
[1:24:02] wasn't there where was the William
[1:24:04] paying him but it was the word
[1:24:06] the discerner of the heart we we listen
[1:24:10] to the tapes there was time after time
[1:24:12] where he was able to discern the heart
[1:24:14] he would assume the life he would
[1:24:16] discern the address I heard one time I
[1:24:19] think it was brother Brown and I told
[1:24:20] him he says he gave he gave an address
[1:24:22] to a woman and there was a lady in the
[1:24:25] crowd that says my he just missed it she
[1:24:28] don't live there he just missed the
[1:24:31] wrong address and brother Branham says
[1:24:33] she came up to the woman afterwards and
[1:24:36] she said he just missed it you don't
[1:24:39] live at that address that's the wrong
[1:24:41] address and she stopped and she says oh
[1:24:43] I forgot to tell you we just moved
[1:24:45] yesterday
[1:24:46] it wasn't a man that was saying I guess
[1:24:49] this I guess that I think this I think
[1:24:53] that it was the word the Messiah Jesus
[1:24:56] Christ
[1:24:57] come on now we're no worshiping a man
[1:24:59] we're not following a man we're not
[1:25:02] following some sensation but is it is
[1:25:05] the word Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:25:08] today and forever proving that he's
[1:25:12] alive to somebody that is looking for
[1:25:15] him
[1:25:17] that has a desire
[1:25:20] but you see before you can find
[1:25:22] something there must be a foundation
[1:25:24] hope this is okay this evening there has
[1:25:26] to be a foundation for your faith but
[1:25:29] the Bantam says I said he hasn't got no
[1:25:31] grounds for Faith no touching of a tree
[1:25:34] having faith he said and having faith
[1:25:36] that's Superstition you've got you have
[1:25:39] to have grounds full of faith and he
[1:25:41] says faith cometh by hearing hearing the
[1:25:44] word of God so the grounds of faith is
[1:25:47] the word of God not man's ideas not
[1:25:49] men's Traditions but is the word of God
[1:25:52] he says if you just take it like a
[1:25:54] newspaper report and something why you
[1:25:57] can't have faith in that he says they
[1:25:59] make errors because they're human but
[1:26:01] this Bible cannot make any errors it's
[1:26:04] got to be perfect because it's the word
[1:26:07] of God and God is no better than his
[1:26:10] word and you're no better than your word
[1:26:12] I'm no better than my word so therefore
[1:26:14] when the Bible says anything remember it
[1:26:17] is settled forever so the base of our
[1:26:21] faith is always the Bible we don't
[1:26:23] believe everything you read in the
[1:26:25] newspaper because there's human errors
[1:26:27] there's human false and brother Brandon
[1:26:29] says you can't read the Bible like a
[1:26:31] newspaper
[1:26:33] he says you can't read it like a
[1:26:35] newspaper how do you read a newspaper
[1:26:37] you throw this out because it might not
[1:26:39] be true you throw that out because it
[1:26:41] might not be true and you pick and
[1:26:43] choose what you want to keep but he says
[1:26:46] you can't do that with the Bible you
[1:26:48] can't read it like a newspaper it's got
[1:26:50] to be a revelation
[1:26:52] for the Bantam says you got to get down
[1:26:54] look up and say God Give Me Faith to
[1:26:57] believe your word you gotta have the
[1:27:00] right approach
[1:27:01] hope this is making sense this evening
[1:27:03] our faith is based on something that is
[1:27:06] unmovable remember heavens and earth
[1:27:08] will pass away but my word will never
[1:27:11] fail so our faith to see Christ is based
[1:27:15] on something solid so there once our
[1:27:18] faith is based on heavens and Norful
[1:27:21] pass away but my word will never fail
[1:27:23] then our desire starts to become a
[1:27:27] reality you look at Hebrews 11 6 but
[1:27:30] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:27:33] him for he that cometh the God must
[1:27:36] believe that he is that he is a rewarder
[1:27:39] of them that diligently seek him so
[1:27:43] before you can never find Christ you
[1:27:46] have to have faith knowing that your
[1:27:48] desire is going to be met
[1:27:51] come on now your desire is going to be
[1:27:54] met by seeing Christ but before that can
[1:27:57] happen your faith has to be on the right
[1:28:00] basis Hey Brother Branham says that you
[1:28:03] have to have faith to start your car you
[1:28:04] have to have when you go into your car
[1:28:06] and turn your ignition he says that is
[1:28:08] Faith turning to turning the key and the
[1:28:11] starting your car and now you have to
[1:28:13] have faith whenever you're walking in
[1:28:15] your legs you're believing that your
[1:28:17] legs is going to catch you but faith in
[1:28:20] my ignition is not going to save me
[1:28:22] Faith in my legs is not going to give me
[1:28:25] a body change so my faith to see the
[1:28:29] supernatural has to be on the right
[1:28:31] thing if you follow me the the Buddhist
[1:28:34] and the muhammads they all have faith
[1:28:36] believing in something but the basis of
[1:28:39] their faith is not producing the
[1:28:42] supernatural but if the basis of your
[1:28:45] faith is on the word then it will
[1:28:47] produce the supernatural every time
[1:28:51] oh my look at Hebrews 11 1. now Faith is
[1:28:56] the substance of things hoped for so
[1:28:59] remember what does the word desire mean
[1:29:01] it is to look to hope for so now that
[1:29:04] desire is going from hoping to find
[1:29:06] something but now that there's a basis
[1:29:09] for your faith it's the substance of
[1:29:12] things hoped for what's that word hoped
[1:29:15] it's past tense you're no longer hoping
[1:29:18] to see Christ but now that your faith is
[1:29:21] done the right thing it's producing the
[1:29:24] evidence
[1:29:25] the realities of the desire is now being
[1:29:29] is now being manifested right in front
[1:29:32] of your eyes
[1:29:34] it's the evidence
[1:29:36] the reality of that desire is now right
[1:29:39] in front of your eyes we can see Jesus
[1:29:41] Christ but the barium says now before
[1:29:43] there was a palm tree to grow in the
[1:29:45] earth there had to be an Earth First
[1:29:48] there are there there be no palm tree to
[1:29:50] grow is that right if you believe in
[1:29:52] Divine Healing the power of God before
[1:29:55] there can be before there's gather
[1:29:57] something created that desire he says is
[1:30:00] that right before there can be a
[1:30:02] creation there has to be a Creator to
[1:30:05] create the creation is that right then
[1:30:08] you are when you are when the Holy Ghost
[1:30:09] created that desire on the inside this
[1:30:12] to see the power of God work in the city
[1:30:15] there's got to be a power of God
[1:30:18] somewhere
[1:30:19] he says it's the Deep calling to the
[1:30:22] Deep we're expecting to see it so we're
[1:30:24] not just hoping by man's man's desire
[1:30:28] but God has placed thou tug and thou
[1:30:31] pull on the inside to pull you to
[1:30:33] himself and brother Branham says and now
[1:30:36] many times you try through unbelief to
[1:30:39] explain that his days is gone but thou
[1:30:41] will not satisfy the scriptures that he
[1:30:44] said the same yesterday today and
[1:30:46] forever and then if your desire today is
[1:30:49] the same desire and that that these
[1:30:51] Greeks were sirs would we see Jesus and
[1:30:55] they were granted that privilege they
[1:30:57] got to see him then if we have the
[1:30:59] desire to see Jesus and if he's the same
[1:31:02] yesterday today and forever then why
[1:31:05] can't we be granted to see the desire
[1:31:09] he says if he's the same yesterday today
[1:31:12] and forever then why can't we see Christ
[1:31:16] I'll bring this down to a close here in
[1:31:18] a few minutes just bear with me a few
[1:31:19] more a few more minutes here I'm going
[1:31:22] to talk about Zacchaeus uh you know I
[1:31:24] can say have you heard the story you've
[1:31:26] read the story but this just started to
[1:31:28] strikeouts I mean you look at Luke 19
[1:31:30] and 2 and behold there was a man's
[1:31:33] Zacchaeus which was the chief among
[1:31:35] Republicans and he was rich and he
[1:31:38] sought to see Jesus who he was
[1:31:41] so before he ever could find Jesus he
[1:31:44] had to look for him and the Bible says
[1:31:47] in the name and continuing on and he
[1:31:49] says then could not for the Press
[1:31:51] because he was little of stature and he
[1:31:54] says he ran before and climbed up into a
[1:31:57] sycamore trade to seek him for he was to
[1:31:59] pass that way so he knew that before he
[1:32:02] was ever in the tree that Christ was
[1:32:04] going to walk by this way he was going
[1:32:06] to walk by the path he was going to walk
[1:32:08] down the road and he wasn't going to let
[1:32:10] this opportunity pass him by so he shot
[1:32:13] him he didn't let the unbelief from the
[1:32:16] Stouts push him back but he was willing
[1:32:18] to press through the Press he was
[1:32:20] willing depressed and the Bible says
[1:32:22] when Jesus come to the place and looked
[1:32:24] up and saw him and said unto him
[1:32:27] Zacchaeus make haste come down for today
[1:32:31] I must abide at thy house I messed abide
[1:32:37] at thy house I didn't come by this way
[1:32:40] on accident but I come to abide in your
[1:32:43] house
[1:32:44] this a message didn't come by accident
[1:32:46] but it's come to abide in your house
[1:32:49] Christ ain't here by accident but he's
[1:32:52] come to abide in your house but you
[1:32:55] notice how how Christ Abode in his house
[1:32:58] the next verse and he made haste come
[1:33:00] down and received him joyfully so before
[1:33:04] Christ could abide in the house he had
[1:33:07] to receive him he had to act on the word
[1:33:11] that spoke to him and then whenever he
[1:33:13] acted upon the word the the Christ
[1:33:16] started to abide but you notice the
[1:33:18] Christ the physical body left the house
[1:33:21] so what's that he mean I'm going to
[1:33:23] abide abide means to take up permanent
[1:33:26] residence it means to live it's means to
[1:33:28] derail so when the body of Christ left
[1:33:31] the Revelation did it
[1:33:34] come on now you notice how the Bible
[1:33:37] says that he wanted to see Jesus for to
[1:33:40] know who he was he wanted to see Jesus
[1:33:43] the body but he wanted to know the God
[1:33:46] on the inside that's what was going to
[1:33:48] abide not the body the revelation we
[1:33:52] might not have the physical body of
[1:33:54] Jesus Christ right here on the Earth but
[1:33:57] the Revelation is abiding in every heart
[1:34:00] it's abiding in every home it's abiding
[1:34:04] in marriages it's abiding in families
[1:34:06] it's abiding in homes
[1:34:08] it's abiding but the painter says the
[1:34:11] Christ is here in every aspect but the
[1:34:14] Corporal body is the same power the same
[1:34:17] anointing I believe the same power that
[1:34:20] held the marriages together in the book
[1:34:22] of Acts and brother Branham state is the
[1:34:25] same power that can hold marriages
[1:34:27] together that can perform the same signs
[1:34:29] the same actions as Jesus Christ the
[1:34:33] same yesterday today and forever do you
[1:34:37] want to see him
[1:34:39] is there a desire on the inside to see
[1:34:42] him and not believe the Christ is here
[1:34:46] to dwelling in our midst if we can just
[1:34:49] see him
[1:34:50] if we can just see him the Bible says in
[1:34:53] Colossians 2 and 6 as she therefore
[1:34:56] receive Christ God receive Christ Jesus
[1:35:00] the Lord so walk he in him
[1:35:03] just like uh just like Zacchaeus
[1:35:06] received Christ it changed his walk you
[1:35:09] notice the Bible says that he looked to
[1:35:11] Christ and says I'm rich I'm going to
[1:35:14] give half of what I own to the poor and
[1:35:17] he says if there's anybody that I have
[1:35:20] dealt wrongfully with I'm going to pay
[1:35:22] it for I'm going to pay it four times as
[1:35:25] much whenever he received Christ he
[1:35:28] started to walk in the ways of Christ
[1:35:32] he had to throw his old actions aside
[1:35:34] here from his own ideas aside and says
[1:35:38] I'm walking in your footsteps and all my
[1:35:41] f Christ has been revealed to you we've
[1:35:44] got to receive him and walk ye in him
[1:35:47] the next verse Colossians 2 and 7 rooted
[1:35:50] and built up in him and established in
[1:35:53] the faith as you have been taught
[1:35:55] abounding for with with Thanksgiving
[1:35:58] Rudy then builds up in him walk in him
[1:36:03] we're now walking in the physical body
[1:36:06] of Christ but the revelation of Jesus
[1:36:09] Christ that's what we're walking in
[1:36:11] that's what we're dwelling in that's
[1:36:13] what's the world against our Tabernacles
[1:36:15] that's what's dwelling in a new life
[1:36:17] Outreach without the revelation of Jesus
[1:36:20] Christ new life now reaches another
[1:36:22] Lodge it's another building your home is
[1:36:25] another home but when the revelation of
[1:36:27] Jesus Christ starts to abide something
[1:36:30] takes place
[1:36:32] the mystery of God has been finished you
[1:36:35] look at Revelations 10 7. but in the
[1:36:37] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:36:39] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:36:41] of God should be finished
[1:36:44] the mystery of who Jesus was was
[1:36:47] finished when Zacchaeus received him and
[1:36:50] whenever you receive the voice of the
[1:36:52] Sabbath Angel The Mystery of God is
[1:36:55] finished as the bio as the musicians
[1:36:57] come
[1:37:00] the Revelation changed Peter's life
[1:37:03] it changed the woman out the well
[1:37:05] that Revelation changed the Apostle Paul
[1:37:08] the Apostle Paul thought he was
[1:37:10] following the Messiah thought he was
[1:37:12] following God whenever he was killing
[1:37:15] Christians he thought he was doing God
[1:37:16] of service but there come a time on the
[1:37:19] road to Damascus that a pillar of fire
[1:37:22] appeared
[1:37:23] and knocked him off his horse and he
[1:37:25] looked up and he says Jesus or he says
[1:37:27] Lord who art thou and he says I am Jesus
[1:37:30] whom thou persecute us that Revelation
[1:37:33] struck in a change he was no longer
[1:37:36] persecuting the Christians but he was
[1:37:38] willing to give up his life
[1:37:40] that Revelation changed him the
[1:37:42] Revelation changed Nathanael
[1:37:44] the Revelation changed the Ethiopian the
[1:37:47] eunuch we know how the story goes with
[1:37:49] the eunuchy the Bible says he desired
[1:37:52] Philip to teach you and he come and he
[1:37:55] started reading the same scriptures
[1:37:58] that that the eunuch was reading Isaiah
[1:38:00] 53 he was reading start of the read
[1:38:02] those same scriptures and the Bible says
[1:38:04] that the Ethiopia looked and he asked
[1:38:06] Philip he says is this speaking of a
[1:38:08] prophet is it speaking of him or is it
[1:38:11] speaking of another
[1:38:12] and the Bible says Philip stopped and he
[1:38:14] says this is Jesus Christ this is Jesus
[1:38:18] and he stopped the Revelation Struck it
[1:38:21] changed the way he was reading scripture
[1:38:23] he was reading the same scriptures
[1:38:26] and as The Story Goes On the Bible says
[1:38:28] he went by a certain pool a certain
[1:38:30] water and says here's water what hinders
[1:38:33] me to be baptized the revelation of
[1:38:36] Christ started to put him into action it
[1:38:39] changed the way he thought it changed
[1:38:41] the way he acted and the Bible says
[1:38:43] Philip looked at him and he says if you
[1:38:45] can believe that Jesus is the Christ you
[1:38:49] can do it you can start acting upon it
[1:38:51] and the Bible says I believe that Jesus
[1:38:54] is the Christ
[1:38:55] and he says let's be baptized let's act
[1:38:58] upon that revelation
[1:39:01] but the Bantam says Christ that Christ
[1:39:03] expressed the word talked he says Christ
[1:39:06] expressed what the word talked amen
[1:39:08] there you are Christ was the expression
[1:39:11] of the word that was wrote Christ
[1:39:13] expressed it and he says now we find
[1:39:16] Jesus now has come to express the word
[1:39:18] now that's what he was yesterday that's
[1:39:21] what he is today that's what he will be
[1:39:23] forever God's word made known is that a
[1:39:27] better word think it no
[1:39:29] God's word expressed word maidenhead
[1:39:32] God's word express show that it is true
[1:39:34] and everything that God would do he did
[1:39:37] it everything that he wrote in the Bible
[1:39:39] of him doing he done it just exactly
[1:39:42] because he was the word expressed he
[1:39:45] says well if he's the same yesterday
[1:39:46] today and forever all of these promises
[1:39:49] hanging to this generation why wouldn't
[1:39:52] he be the same today to express
[1:39:54] everything that God's word promised he
[1:39:57] says see it has to be exactly the same
[1:39:59] because that's what he was then that's
[1:40:01] what he is now he will be forever God's
[1:40:04] word expressed and I believe God is here
[1:40:07] expressing his word to this generation

[1:52:04] Heist railroad heist in history

[1:52:13] Heist were
[1:52:14] they had planned this out
[1:52:16] the
[1:52:18] trains
[1:52:20] was carrying
[1:52:21] [Music]
[1:52:23] uh
[1:52:26] a lot of
[1:52:27] precious metal
[1:52:30] currency
[1:52:34] and the greatest Heist
[1:52:36] that that that that that was uh in in
[1:52:40] research or in in all history
[1:52:43] was done by a false light
[1:52:48] the robbers
[1:52:50] put up a false light
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:53] stopped the train
[1:52:56] and when they stopped the train
[1:52:59] the guys got in took the stuff
[1:53:03] was gone
[1:53:05] when they took their currency
[1:53:09] here's the thing and when you're
[1:53:11] listening to brother Josh preach
[1:53:16] the Bible says that the Beast of
[1:53:20] Revelations
[1:53:21] 13. which came out in brother Merle
[1:53:24] brought it to my attention the other day
[1:53:26] that I did not
[1:53:27] uh uh uh uh put credentials with with
[1:53:32] the Beast and the water the other day
[1:53:34] but the water according to Revelation 17
[1:53:36] means people's multitudes
[1:53:38] so the Beast that came up out of the out
[1:53:42] of
[1:53:43] uh the the multitudes and you know
[1:53:45] that's the Roman Catholic church we
[1:53:47] understand that
[1:53:48] then their Beast came up out of the
[1:53:50] ground which was
[1:53:52] um no people
[1:53:55] and it was like unto a lamb
[1:53:58] the United States
[1:54:00] 13th chapter
[1:54:02] The Book of Revelations
[1:54:04] we had 13 colonies followed with 13
[1:54:07] colonies 13 stars 13. 13 is America
[1:54:16] and America the Bible says would cause
[1:54:18] the whole world to wander after it had
[1:54:20] become a supernatural or a it would come
[1:54:23] a superpower
[1:54:26] and that the U.S would give power unto
[1:54:30] the Beast
[1:54:31] and would cause and would give power
[1:54:34] unto an image
[1:54:35] unto the Beast
[1:54:38] the image is a fake Jesus Christ
[1:54:45] it's not the real Jesus it's not the
[1:54:48] real word
[1:54:50] so the people are coming
[1:54:54] by a fake light
[1:54:58] they're going to church
[1:55:01] they're thinking they're coming to
[1:55:04] Christ
[1:55:05] and they don't have the slightest idea
[1:55:08] they're looking for they're they're
[1:55:10] claiming they've they've got a pumpkin
[1:55:11] and they're holding a watermelon
[1:55:14] they have taken Creeds
[1:55:18] calling that Christ
[1:55:20] they're taking putting their name on a
[1:55:23] book and calling that Christ
[1:55:26] who started it
[1:55:28] Rome the Beast the image they're bowing
[1:55:33] to that image and the people are
[1:55:38] following after it you don't have to be
[1:55:41] Catholic
[1:55:42] oh you don't have to be Catholic
[1:55:46] you could be Protestant
[1:55:48] but if you're bowing to the traditions
[1:55:51] of a man instead of the word
[1:55:55] [Music]
[1:55:59] sirs
[1:56:00] the word still here
[1:56:02] and the word is still being made flesh
[1:56:08] oh listen
[1:56:10] now brother Josh was talking
[1:56:13] uh the Jews and the Samaritans were
[1:56:17] looking for Christ because they had seen
[1:56:19] in the scripture that it's fixing to
[1:56:21] come and so when Christ come and done
[1:56:23] the Messiah sign
[1:56:25] the the prophetic sign they'd say ha
[1:56:27] he's here they had been looking for that
[1:56:30] scripture now here we are at the end of
[1:56:33] the Gentile age waiting for the
[1:56:35] Fulfillment waiting for prophecy waiting
[1:56:39] for the Rapture and God has come in this
[1:56:42] age not in any other age but this age
[1:56:44] with a messiah sign
[1:56:46] and that Prophet was more than just a a
[1:56:49] gift of Prophecy it was a messiah sign
[1:56:52] to to declare wait
[1:56:55] what happened what happened it was at
[1:56:58] the end of the Jewish dispensation and
[1:57:01] bringing it into the Gentile now at the
[1:57:03] end of the Gentiles dispensation it's
[1:57:06] going back to the Jews weave on and
[1:57:08] before God can reveal himself to the
[1:57:10] Jews you've got to be out of here
[1:57:17] and Satan is putting up the false light
[1:57:22] trying to get everyone
[1:57:24] amen
[1:57:26] but when we were going thinking that
[1:57:28] this and then God sends and shines his
[1:57:31] light on the word and says no no no no
[1:57:32] no no no no he'll never go outside his
[1:57:34] word
[1:57:35] he'll never go outside of a creek or go
[1:57:37] into a Creed he has to come here there's
[1:57:41] scripture that must be fulfilled here
[1:57:48] can you say Amen
[1:57:50] I like that I I I Hallelujah

[1:58:14] blessed we are to have that word

[1:58:23] Heist and the false light and I thought
[1:58:25] Dear God
[1:58:27] that ain't what Satan has done
[1:58:30] if that ain't Revelations 13 and the
[1:58:33] whole world is is he's hijacked the
[1:58:36] whole church supposedly he's hijacked
