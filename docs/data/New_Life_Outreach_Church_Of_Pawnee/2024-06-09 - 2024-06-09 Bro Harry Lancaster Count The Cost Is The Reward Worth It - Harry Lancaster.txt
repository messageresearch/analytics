turn to Luke chap [Music] 14 Luke chapter 14 and we'll start at at verse 25 and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sisters yay in his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whoo whoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and cth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it less happily after he ha laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what king going to make war against another king sth not down first and consult whether he was able with 10,000 to meet him that cometh against him with 20,000 or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an amassage and desireth conditions of Peace So likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple salt is good but if the salt have lost his Savor wherewith shall it be seasoned it it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dungill but Men cast it out he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear let's go ahead and go before the Lord Lord Jesus we come into your presence this morning Lord and Lord we thank you for allowing us to gather together once more Lord we thank you for uh a beautiful day Lord Jesus we thank you for Lord we just thank you for your presence Lord we lord we come before you and Lord we've worshiped we've we've done our best to to set an atmosphere Lord Jesus and Lord we pray that you would just take control of the remainder of the service Lord Lord that you would just Lord take the the words that that I would speak Lord and may you be the one that would provide the inspiration behind behind everything Lord It's Lord we didn't gather here to to see whether I was able to pull together things and make a nice sounding sermon or make something that would uh tickle our ears or entertain us Lord but Lord We Gather because we want to hear from you and we want to be in your presence Lord Jesus Lord I pray that you would take control Lord and that everything that is said would just be glorifying to you Lord and a blessing to the people we just commit the M remainder of the service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may all have your seats you know in in life we have to continually be looking at cost versus reward in all of our decisions um is you know something's very simple is the amount of work that I'll be putting in worth the reward that I'll get out of it um is is the enjoyment and the memories that I'll get from my vacation worth the amount of money that I'm going to have to pay for it um is the the new boat or the new gun or the new car or the new computer or the new clothes worth the time that I have to spend to earn the money necessary to purchase them um you know you can look at you can look at the news and see places where people have had to to make those decisions and sometimes they were right sometimes they were wrong um you you know just recently just actually over the weekend we had the news that Israel went in and was able to rescue four of their hostages from Hamas and they had a cost of less than a 100 Palestinian lives to get their four people back well Israel decided the cost of 100 lives of the enemy was worth the reward of getting four of their people back all right you know you can look at the news and see that you have the news of California putting up the minimum wage to $20 an hour and now you see the news going on of yeah all the results of that and maybe they didn't do the best analysis on the cost versus reward of what would be the cost of doing this what would be the rewards we would get what would be the problems that we would get from it but throughout life we continually go into situations where you're making these kinds of decisions of is the cost worth the reward is is what we're going to receive at the end worth what we have to go through to get there what we have to to go through to receive the result let's turn to Matthew chapter 10 Matthew chapter 10 and we're going to start at verse 32 whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven think not that I come to send peace on Earth I come not to send peace but a sword for I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's fo shall be be thy shall be they of his own household but he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my shake shall find it let's go back to uh the Old Testament we're going to turn to Numbers Chapter 13 Numbers Chapter 13 and we'll start at verse 25 and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of parin to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land wither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the h ites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell on the mountains and the CA and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb stilled the people before Moses and he said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants and the sons of anac which come of the Giants and we are in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight okay now Israel had come out of Egypt they had come through defeating at that time the greatest army on Earth defeating the greatest people on earth Not By Their Own Strength but by God's Miracles by God's power they had come out and now they come into this land and the spies go in yeah and the majority of them come back and give a report saying oh yeah the land's great but we don't have the strength to overcome it we don't have the strength to take it on and they were able to convince the people that the reward is not worth the risk okay okay yes there was a promise but that promise is actually not strong enough that the reward is not enough for us to be willing to go through this because we think that we will be destroyed when we go in we don't think that we can take this on what we're going to get in the end is not worth what we have to give out what we have to uh what we have to risk what we have to chance we're chancing our own destruction and that's not enough of a reward for us to be willing to to risk our lives for this okay let's go to John chapter 6 John chapter 6 and we're going to start at verse 60 many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and he said said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus unto the twel will ye also go away then Simon Peter answered to him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God bless the Lord we see the same kind of situation in as we're watching Jesus speaking to his disciples he had obviously more than the 12 that were following him he had a larger group and the majority of them could not go past a certain point they could no longer make this risk verse reward analysis work they hit the point of going what Jesus has to offer is not worth what we have to do it is not worth continuing to press in and it is not worth accepting what he's saying it's not worth following these words anymore it was great while we were just he's giving us power we're having Authority we're able to do Miracles we're able to do these different things we're seeing Jesus do the healing but now Jesus is saying things we can't understand now Jesus is saying things that we can't comprehend we can't accept and I can no longer go past this point we've now hit the point where I have to turn back I have to walk because the reward that's out there is not worth what I'm going through just like the children of Israel then they looked at it and it was a land flowing with milk and honey just like it had been promised it was the land that they bring back these grapes that it takes two men to carry these huge bunches and all these different things and it's like it is a wonderful land but it's not worth it okay it's not worth what we have to go through it's not worth the trials it's not worth the struggles it's not worth the pain okay you know you go back and in Genesis we have the history of Cain and Abel and we know brother brandom talked about that Cain was religious Cain came and he offered the sacrifice he he he came to worship he came to do these different things and then God came to correct him God came and said I can't accept your sacrifice if you would just do the same as your brother I'll accept it that's all you have to do but yet Cain looked at it and went being accepted by God is not worth me putting down my pride it's not worth me going to the same place as my brother the acceptance of God is Not Enough the promise of acceptance by God is not enough to make make me change to make me take this next step the reward that was there was not valuable enough to him it wasn't enough to make him take those steps you know you can continue on and go to Esau with his Birthright yeah you know Esau comes out of the fields and he's hungry and here Jacob has this pottage that he's fixed yeah and we know the scriptures say that Esau despised the birthright Birthright was not even valuable enough for him to be willing to have the patience to wait an hour while he asked his mom or asked a servant to fix him some food yeah he didn't even have to fix the food himself he could have asked one of these other individuals and waited an hour yeah but his Birthright was not even worth the patience of one hour God the reward that he could receive from this Birthright was was not worth the patience of a single hour to wait for someone else to fix the food it wasn't worth the effort that he would have to put into it all right as we continue in to the Book of Joshua here you have the story of aen and they've come and they've defeated Jericho and you know achen looks and he sees the gold and the silver and and the garments and everything yeah and as is with most of us men his probably was thinking the along the lines of my family could be so much better off you know if you look at it it was 200 shekels of silver weight which is a weight of about 5 PBS 50 shekels of gold would weigh about 1.25 pounds and the value of the silver and gold is more than the average laborer can earn in a lifetime we're not talking about he found a Year's wages we're not talking about he found five years wages we're talking about he found a lifetime the rest of my life I couldn't work to earn this much money okay and it I mean when you think about it then from the mindset it's like it's not that much gold and silver actually it's it's 5 lb and 1.25 lbs this isn't like he took this huge Heap that's a pretty small pile you 5 pounds of gold because gold isn't light so to only have 5 pounds of gold is not you know it's not like he had to cover this huge area with gold to have only or that was the Silver to have only you know a little over pound of gold we're not talking about huge masses of gold but yet this was so much that he could look at it and go my family will be changed for the rest of its life if I take this okay and so the reward that was being promised what God had promised what God had put out there was not worth the risk of giving up what he could solidly go this could change my family there was more value in disobedience in his eyes than there was value in obedience he made the decision on and ultimately it doesn't talk exactly about what his mindset is but I think particularly as men we can go this is probably where he was thinking I don't think that he was going man I can go out and buy the nicest tent in the world and I can you know we can set this up and we can get you know nice big flat screen TV on the side and all this kind of stuff it was he was probably looking at this will take care of me and my family for probably Generations my kids will be taken care of we'll be taken care of maybe we'll be able to be in a little bit better station of society all right but my family will be in a better place all right and I'm not taking much I'm taking a small amount but it'll change things so much and the risk versus reward he saw more reward in dis obedience he thought than the reward that he could see in obedience okay all right you know you go into the New Testament in the Book of Luke the Rich Young Ruler comes to Jesus to ask how he can gain eternal life okay he's searching he wants he desires he knows there's more yeah otherwise why would have even come to ask he knows that there's something he can go beyond and so he comes to Jesus and he asks what must I do yes yes and Jesus tells him okay make sure that you obey the prophets do this do this do this he said I've done all those things for a youth I've I've made sure to to live the way that I'm supposed to I've made sure to obey all the laws I've made sure to even you know obey the oral tradition all these kind of things I'm living the best life I can yeah yeah and Jesus says okay one thing you lack one thing sell all that you have and follow me yeah and it was at that moment yeah that he re-evaluated and said you know what eternal life is not worth my riches the promise of eternal life the the hope that that's what I would achieve is not worth yeah me giving up all of this yeah okay I can now look at it I go you know what I can I don't think it's I don't think that's I don't think that's the truth I think I can I can get eternal life a different route I can do whatever he justified it in his mind but ultimately he was making the decision yeah that my wealth is worth more than the promise of eternal life okay all right you know Satan still wants to make that same kind of argument oh yes he does he'll tell you and this is one where he'll tell all of us but let's hit the young people for a little bit he'll tell each of you that you are missing out on things yeah that you are missing out on what you could be enjoying in life yeah there's so much out there that you could go do there's so much out there that you could go experience you're missing out on life you're you're too legalistic you're following a man yeah and Satan doesn't even have to take you fully into the world he's not necessarily looking at you and going man I want to make you a drug addict or I want to make you a drunk or I make you whatever he's going look there are people out there that are Christians that are enjoying life more than you yeah all you have to do is go out and you can still be a Christian you can still worship God you can still go to church you can can still go through all the motions and do everything and then look you get to go out there and you guys you can go out and you can you can wear shorts you don't have to wear pants all the time you can go out and you know you can enjoy some of the entertainments you can watch the latest movies or the latest TV and not have to listen to a minister up here blasting you for daring to do that you can go out and listen to the latest music or whatever whatever entertainment it might be and yet you can still worship God you can still go to church you can still do these different things okay the women they can go out and you know what you can trim your hair you can try to have the latest style you can use a little bit of makeup to make yourself look a little prettier look a little bit better you can get earrings you can have the the latest style that maybe isn't quite as covering as it should be but it's not blatant you don't have to get all the way out there you know you don't have to wear the super long super flowy skirts that are so hard to find that when you find a place you're paying 60 bucks for a single skirt cuz no one makes them or not many do you can go buy the cheaper stuff you'll still be covered it'll be okay or you know what you can even you can just wear pants then you'll be covered it's fine and you can still go to church you can still worship you can still be a Christian is the risk really worth the reward look at them out there they go to church you can even go to a fancy church where you get some of these bigname people coming through all the time to either lead worship or have concerts or do the you can get to you can go to a nice church you can do all these kinds of things yeah and you can still be a Christian you don't need to go into the world and drink or do drugs or anything you still are a Christian and Satan puts it out there and he wants you to look at it and go is the cost is the reward worth the cost there's an easier way yeah you can still be a Christian you can still worship God you can still do all these things yeah you know you can still you can go out and do you really need to be going to church three times a week hey you know Wednesday nights you could work a little longer make a little more money for the family you could go to a church that they just do the morning service so you could have Sunday evening to spend with the family that's a good thing spending time with your spouse and kids this is positive yeah you know you could go watch football games too if you want you could go do this but you could spend time with the family you can do positive things yeah instead of investing all that time at church and you can still be a Christian yeah you can still worship God you can still do all those things is the RO really worth the price is the reward really worth what you're going through and these are the questions that Satan will continually bombard you with he'll let you look around and see what everybody else is doing and see what everybody else is enjoying okay and there are going to be days where your flesh Rises up a little bit and you go man I would like to have a Sunday evening hour and then to go do whatever instead of spent I think everyone can probably be willing to admit all day Sunday is not restful all day church is not restful I don't end Sunday going man I am outside of my spiritual from the physical I'm not going man I am rested I am ready to go it's not how you feel at the end of Sunday yeah if you do I want to know your secret because obviously I'm missing something and so there are times in the flesh where you go man I would like to have that Sunday evening to rest to relax to do whatever and Satan plays on the Flesh and he plays on that desire to go well this is what I'd like to do man I don't the sisters would probably like it if they didn't have to struggle so much to try to find clothing that worked if they could take a little bit easier route cuz it's not the easiest I watch my wife struggle to try to find she finds a place she thinks she can buy some and then they come out with a new style that doesn't work anymore and she has to start looking all over again to find somebody else that sells something decent I've got it easy I can go to Walmart I can go to Target I can go to coals I can go to you name the store I can find something there to wear guys got it easy but Satan wants to continually tell us and put it up there that it's just not worth it okay it's just not worth it it's not worth standing out like an oddball it's not worth struggling to find the good clothes it's not worth going to church three times a week when you could get so many benefits by only going once I mean those extra hours at work that could pay these bills or help you get out of debt faster help help you do this or help you do that yeah you know that time Sunday evening with the family it could really it could help me connect to my kids better we could have a better relationship all these kinds of things it's not worth it you can still be a Christian and not have to struggle so hard okay that's what Satan will whisper in your head over and over That's what Satan will put out there as this is what what you can do we just read in numbers about how the children of Israel decided that it wasn't worth it to go into the promised land but yet here you have Joshua and Caleb that both stand up and they say no we are more than strong enough we are more than powerful enough we have the promise that Land Is Ours we want it they looked at it and they placed value come on on what promis had been given to them they placed a value that decried everything else they didn't care what they might have to risk they didn't care what troubles they might face they didn't care how big the enemy was yeah the promise was worth more to them than anything else that came along right the promise was worth every bit of struggle that they would face it was worth every battle it was worth every trial the promise was value valed as more yes you know you go to the Book of Daniel and you see the three Hebrew children and here they are they they're brought up before Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadnezzar says worship worship the worship the image or you're going to be thrown into the fire no ifs hands or butts this is what's going to happen yeah yeah and in Daniel 3:1 16 it says Shadrach mhach and Abednego answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up yeah yeah they looked at the situation and they were like we know God is able but you know what even if he chooses not to The Obedience and the reward that comes from it is worth the price we are willing to sell out our lives we are willing to die if that's what necessary because we place a higher value on that than on ourselves they didn't know they weren't sitting there with a vision they weren't sitting there with you know the Prophet Daniel beside them saying you're going to be saved yeah they didn't know they knew God was able but they sat there and they looked at it went the cost is worth it we are willing to pay the price we are willing to give it all up if that's what's required amen we know God can save us but if he requires us to die fine and we're not talking about this being what you might classify as a more simple or an easier death yeah anyone that has ever just gotten any type of burn on their hand or arm knows this is not going to be a pleasant way of going this is not you know it's like you hear about those in history and the Dark Age of things that were killed by beheading that was actually one of the better ways to go normally if you had a guy that was experienced one slice it was done you probably didn't even really feel the pain it was just over death in fire was not a pleasant way to go this was not in any way and they knew this yeah I guarantee they had had to stoke fire sometime as a child they had received Burns but yet they still looked at it and went the cost is worth it okay we are willing to pay the price because of the reward that is on the other side in Acts chapter 7 you have Steven and Steven is brought before the San hedrin and he's got his own trial going as he's talking to them and he has this great sermon that he lays out to them all all right and coming in at acts 7: 51 says ye stiff necked and uncircumcised and Harden ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they nashed on him with their teeth but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and he said behold I see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of God then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul and they stoned Steven calling upon God saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit yeah and he kneeled down and cried with a Lou loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep Stephen could have stopped talking at any point M he delivered this sermon they're upset they're nashing him with their teeth they're doing all these things he didn't have to say what he saw when he looked up at Heaven if he hadn't said that he might have just gotten a beating and been released he might have had whatever but everything that he had was the reward at the end is worth everything that's right okay making sure to declare as clearly as I can that Christ is King is worth everything whatever the price may be whatever the cost whatever I may have to face all right when he was being dragged out to be stoned he could have tried to oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean it I didn't do whatever he could have done something to try to prevent it okay but he doesn't he goes on and he simply goes Lord may you receive me and Lord forgive them don't don't hold this against them everything that he was doing he was going the reward at the end is worth the cost whatever it may be that I have to face whatever I may have to go through whatever yeah pain whatever suffering okay and once again just like we talked about with the fire Dying by stoning is not a pleasant experience this is not a quick and it's over this drags on and this is pain over and over and over right okay and yet throughout the process there's no recanting there's no going oh I was wrong it's fully Lord receive me and Lord forgive them everything he was facing he was going it's worth it okay the price is worth it amen for every single blow every single stone that struck it's worth it okay you know when when my family and I lived in Florida and Alabama one of the things that we enjoyed to do a few different times for vacations was go up to Tennessee into the the Smoky Mountains and we would enjoy hiking uh we didn't do the hardest Trails by any means but we would enjoy going out in in the Smoky Mountains and doing the different trails and I always liked I would get the list of all the different trails and the ones that I always tried to go towards were the ones that would get you to a waterfall if you could hike out to be able to see the waterfall that was the best trail to go on yeah you know there were other trails that were pretty cool uh you know we got to go on uh I think it's if I remember correctly it's klingman Dome is one of the highest points in the Smoky Mountains around Tennessee we did that hike we did some of the others but we went the waterfall was always a really cool one and there were a couple of these waterfall trails that were less than a mile to get to you know not not a bad hike and there were a couple that were longer that were you know 1.3 miles or 1.7 miles or whatever it might be and you know you would always start out on these these trails and there were always other people that were out there hiking as well that maybe they would be passing you going out cuz they were better trained and you know more fit and so they could hike a little faster or maybe you would be passing people because somehow we were more fit and then you'd also have the people that were passing the other direction yeah and I know I remember there were at least a few of these trails that you had hit a point that you started to wonder is this really worth it okay is is let's be honest is this waterfall really going to be that cool yeah we've walked this far I'm starting to get tired is this really worth the effort that I'm putting into this is this really worth the struggle and the sweat and the blister and the whatever else is what I'm actually going to get to worth what I'm experiencing okay all right and occasionally as you were going along you would talk to one of the people that were returning and you would ask the question hey is it worth it is this really worth what I'm going through yeah because you wanted to know from somebody that had actually seen it somebody that had been there somebody that had gone through it and you're going is this worth it tell me I need somebody to tell me that it's worth it I need somebody to tell me that what I'm experiencing is valuable enough because of what I'm going to reach that's right and what I'm going to achieve and what I'm going to see yes and they would say and they' go oh yeah it's worth it yeah or occasionally You' get something to be like it's all right and then you're going well all right do I really want to keep going do I yeah you know You' get sometimes get the people that they were oh yeah it's amazing you've got keep going you can make it keep going you're going to be able to get there you know I started thinking about along the the lines of this sermon because last week when we were in Claremore there was a hike to get to the bathroom for anybody that was at the picnic on Saturday it you had to walkways to get there and we had walked over to our car which is about halfway point between where we were eating where the bathroom was and Brother Sam Parker was coming back and I think it was Luke was getting ready to to walk over there and brother Sam's like you can make it you're almost there you've almost made it yeah and it you know it was funny we all laughed because it wasn't that far a hike you know but it made me start thinking about was like how often in life are we at that point where you just need someone to tell you hey it's worth it hey you can you can make it you can go a little bit further and it made me think about these hiking trails and when you would be going along and we never went to some of the waterfalls that were the furthest I remember there were some hikes listed on there that it was multiple miles to get to the waterfall and we had kids I wasn't going to try it I immediately I didn't need to see it to me I knew the value was not there okay cuz my kids were also small at the time it was not I'm dealing with teenagers that can hike on their own I'm dealing with kids I'm probably going to have to carry yeah a lot of the way going multiple miles to see a waterfall was not valuable enough to me okay what I could get to was not worth the effort that I was going to have to put into it all right now if it had been just me and my wife maybe I would have rethought it maybe it would have been like hey you know we're two adults we can walk or hike that far yeah but I looked at the situation and some of those hikes were not valuable enough other of the hikes like I said those were less than a mile or that maybe 1.3 miles or something okay we can do this we can put in the effort and there was enough value at the end that I could justify the effort that I was putting into it what I was going to see or what I was going to experience was worth the cost was worth everything that I was going to go through Satan wants to continually be telling you that it's not worth it that what what you're going to get to and what you're going to achieve the reward that you're going to get at the end is not worth the effort that you're putting in okay he's the one who wants to tell you that there's an easier way or he's the one that wants to tell you there's a different route or there's a different thing that you can do I don't know how many of you have read Pilgrims Progress but there's this one character in Pilgrim's Progress that I cannot remember the name right off the top of my head but there's this one character that jumps onto the road by climbing over the wall didn't go to the gate that you're supposed to enter by and he what did you say the name was ignorance so ignorance comes in ignorance is willing to just jump over the fence or jump over the wall to get onto the path he doesn't go by the way that he's supposed to he doesn't go by the the cross so that he can have his burdens lifted or anything he just hops the wall and starts going along when it comes time to pass the the river of death instead of going through the river of death which helps wash away everything that you've gone through he finds a Fairman that can barge him across instead of waiting for an invitation to come to the celestial City he goes up to the city just on his own like oh yeah they're just going to let me in because everything to him what he wanted to receive was only worth this much of a cost it wasn't worth going all the way it wasn't worth surrendering completely it wasn't worth going all the way back to the correct gate it wasn't worth going all the way back to the Cross going all the way back to where he could have burdens lifted and sins covered and sins washed it wasn't it wasn't worth all that it was worth this much but the price to receive what he wanted was more than he was willing to pay and so he ends up turned away from the city because he hasn't come by the right Road he hasn't done he hasn't paid the price that is supposed to be paid he hasn't gone through all the steps of the journey that he supposed to go through and all too often that's the point that Satan is trying to pull us into he's trying to get you to go through the route of ignorance he's trying to get you to accept that hey there's a shortcut this Direction you don't have to go through a full confession to Christ you don't have to be filled with the Holy Ghost just accept Christ and that's enough that's all you have to do go you know go to one of these churches and all you have to do is I accept Christ boom you're done moving on enjoy life now you don't have have to do any more than that all right you can live just this and you're still paying a price I mean you're not you're not out in the world just doing whatever you're still paying a price so that's good enough right but you don't have to pay as high a price you can go the cheaper route you can go the easier route you can go the more simple way all right John 16 and: 33 it says these things I have spoken to you that you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Matthew chapter 6 and verse 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you 1 Corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24 know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as un certainty so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it un into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away yeah you know Paul writes and he talks about the Christian Life like it's a race and I know we've heard so many servants talking about what it's like to race and you know there's it was interesting I think it was a few years ago I found that there is such a thing as what's called Extreme racing and there's this one that I found that I thought was super interesting that it was called the Eco challenge it's no longer running now but it was a race that ran for multiple years and you would have teams that came from different countries they would be four-person teams they had to be mixed you had to have both male and female on the team could be three in one could be two and two could be whatever but had to have at least one of both sexes and they would do these races in super rugged country and there would be sections where you would have to do uh there was one that I saw where you had to first off start off in a boat and you had to paddle and sail from one Island to another Island no Motors you were the motor then you got to this island and you had to hike however many miles this was and I mean it was Miles we're not even talking like this is four or five it's like 20 30 this is or maybe it was even more than that it was a big it was a whole lot then you get back in your boat you paddle to a different Island and there you get out your mountain bikes and you do a mountain bike trail that I would never imagine touching much less biking I mean they're doing when I picture mountain biking before I had ever looked into this it was like mountain biking you kind of had a trail they didn't really have Trails some places they did other places you're biking and you're going where are they going they didn't get to have any type of Technology with them they had a map and a compass that was how they navigated you would be out in the middle of this jungle with a map and a compass no GPS no going yes I know exactly where I am it's no you have to navigate from point A to point B then after you finish your bike race you get back on a boat you paddle another section until finally you do one more Road Race running and they had these different was stations that you had to get to and there were cut offs if you didn't reach a was station by this amount of time then you were out and I mean they're going through and they're getting major blisters they're getting major body aches they're doing all this kind of stuff as they're pushing through it comes in there's rainstorms there's all these kind of things going on it's absolutely miserable forget like the idea of doing a 5k or even a marathon this is just torture and yet people go through and they train and they prepare themselves and they do everything to be able to go okay I have to be able to carry this much equipment because I have to have food and Waters I'm going through I have to be able to uh do these different things and I have to prepare myself to be able to handle this much and I need to be a know that my team can handle this many miles in this much time at this pace and yada yada yada yada yada they're doing all these different things to prepare themselves and I watched this and it gave me a completely different thought about when Paul talked about it being a race I know when Paul talked about being raced he was talking about the kind of races that the Greeks ran the marathons this kind of stuff but I'm watching this extreme racing and I'm going I think this is more like what the Christian Life is we don't get just this a flat Road you keep running on we're going through every bit of struggle that there can be you've got the storms coming you've got different types of things where you have to do not just running but you have to bike you have to paddle you have to do this you have to do that you're going to deal with mountains you're going to deal with valleys you're going to deal with calm Rivers where you have to paddle cuz there's no current you have to deal with the Raging Rapids you have to deal with this you have to deal with that yeah and you look at it and I look at these people that are competing to do this and I'm going who in their right mind thinks that the reward is worth this I'm sorry I enjoy my food I enjoy my recliner I enjoy my air conditioning I do not look at this and go oh yeah I want to train for that this is I had to push myself to train to do a 5k with my wife because that was one of her big goals in life is she wanted to do a 5k so we trained and we did one we did one I'm not going to say we'll never do another one but we did one and that was it we haven't done another one since but we did it we accomplished one but I look at these these types of racism and go how do you even think this is worth it it's not like they're winning millions of dollars at the end of this race yes there was there was a there was a prize purse but 40,000 50,000 I forget what it was but you weren't getting rich off this race this was not I'm changing my life kind of money okay but yet they have put in months and years of training to be able to go through these types of conditions and go through this type environment and push themselves to the point of failing I saw a uh part of my years back one of the leadership training things that I did with Chick-fil-A it showed a a video series that they had produced that was based around a uh Georgia College and their uh rowing team they had a national champion rowing team this women's rowing team that they had won all the titles they had done all these different things and they talked about what it was to row I've you know I'd seen Clips I've seen videos I knew what rowing was but then you actually start to hear about it and look into what these athletes put themselves through to row a boat and I mean these races are generally over in a couple minutes these are not the kind of rowing they were doing this was not a cross the ocean this was okay we're doing however many hundreds of meters or whatever it was and they're done in like I said a couple minutes um you know maybe you're doing maybe you have one of the longer races that's a mile or two once again they still Pro they power through these things in minutes these are not super long races but they talked about how they have to train to get to the point where their bodies can actually use oxygen at a higher percentage rate than how most of us can they drill themselves and they talk about the fact that when they're rowing the muscles start to scream at you within the first 30 seconds to 60 seconds the muscles start to break down because they're being torn apart and so they start releasing whatever the chemical is into your system so it is burning it is pain the almost the entire race you are suffering through this entire thing and so the goal is that hey whatever size the rowing team and I think that that particular crew that I looked I can't remember if it was a a six-man or eight man but whatever it's like so you have a team and and we are making the goal all eight of us are going to suffer together for this many minutes to achieve this goal that's what we're promising to each other is I can bear the pain if you can right I can bear the cramps and the blisters and the sheer Agony of this to support those that are on the team with me and the prize at the end once again these were College athletes they weren't getting money at the end they didn't get a nice paycheck this was before they started paying C College athletes this was just great here you get a medal or whatever you get a plaer that's what you get and and yet even then they looked at it and they went you know what the reward is worth the pain all right the reward is worth what we're going to suffer the reward is worth everything that we're going to go through Philippians chter 3 and verse 12 not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after that if I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen I ignore all the pain around me I ignore all the tests and trials because I am focused on this is the goal this is the reward at the end and that's where all of my focus and all of my value is being placed I willing to go through anything to get there amen amen Philippians chapter 3 at verse 7 but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ am Revelations 12 starting at verse 10 it says and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death in the NIV version that last bit it says they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from Death they looked at it and they went you know what we can what the promise is at the end what the reward is at the end is worth it all it's worth my very death if that's what the price is if the price is me losing this physical life I am willing to pay it because there is more value there than there is here there is more value in the end result than the price that I'm paying right now okay like I mentioned earlier sometimes we go through points in our life where we need to hear it from somebody else we need to get that little bit of encouragement and go is it really worth it is it worth the cost is it worth the struggle that I'm going through is it worth the pain that I'm experiencing is it worth the problems that I'm facing in the sermon the comforter brother brandom says I was thinking as Billy there I I held his mother's hand my wife wife when she was passing away just a few doors below where mother is now when she looked over and she'd had an experience there before she died just a girl 22 years old mother of two children and she said Billy you have talked about it you have preached about it said honey you don't know what it is how glorious it is we had just found this good old gospel way then she said stay with it Billy stay with it don't never leave it it pays off in this hour hallu brother Brandon was still still very young in his ministry he was not at the point where he was drawing huge crowds he was just starting this was the point where he had just turned his back on going to preach in the Pentecostal world and he was going through the punishment as he was losing his wife and then would lose his daughter and his wife as she was dying she had died and then came back for a few minutes or a few moments and it was at that moment she's telling her husband she's telling him it's worth it stay with it don't ever leave it it pays off in this hour it pays off at the end in the sermon the impersonation of Christianity talking about the same situation he says then when I stood by the side of my wife hope the mother of my my boy billian my little girl Sharon and seen her take a hold of my hand while her dark eyes looked to me and spoke of that place she had just returned from and desired to go back and told me never fail to preach this gospel Billy you don't understand what a joy it is to go like this and a few hours after that laying my hands on the head of my little dying baby Yonder placed it in the arms of the mother when I said oh God I know that you raised the sap in the trees in the spring and bring forth the bud and the fruit and hide it in the ground while the winter is going on you've got to be God and I believe with all my heart that this phenomena boy that was born in Galilee 20 20 200 years ago that as he walked around according to the scripture to me he was the promised Messiah no matter what they say I believe it and I know that there is something within me that shows me things to come that a supernatural being appears and I see things before it comes and he warns me of such but here I am without warning up against this thing here there lays the mother dead there there is Papa laying out yonder and now you're going to take my little baby from my arms God are you going to do that take my darling and the black sheet began to fold before me I knew he had done it if the main spring hadn't been there Satan said to me now what do you think of it even your darling little baby he's going to take it from your arms how cruel that was the new spirit that was all the intellectuals yeah there I stood my bones beating together I thought where would I go I would go out and get on a drunk and you never drank in your life but I'd do it anyhow he told you not to but I would do it anyhow I'd show him who his boss yeah Satan wants to come and go it's not worth the cost it's not worth the price the building of this Tower is not not worth what you're going to have to pay to get it done the reward at the end is not worth what you're going through it's not worth what you're experiencing it's not worth the trials that you're facing it's not worth the tests you're going through yeah and I said s I can't he is the boss it was all down to the mainst string I'm so glad there is a main spring when I walked up the road and Mr Eiser my family gone I was going to walk up I I couldn't go to the Grave I just walked up the road flood had just descending not long and Mr Eiser come up the road he jumped out of the car and he said Billy I want to ask you something I've seen you crying out here in that tent I've heard you preaching and how you was so enthused on the message that you were bringing and you were bringing to the people now what does it mean to you now do you still love him would you still say you would serve him yeah I said Mr Eiser if he sent me to hell I'd still love him for there's been something placed in here see that is not no longer I but it's him brother brandom received that encouragement early on in his ministry from his wife saying don't turn back don't go away because it pays off in the end in the sermon convinced and then concerned brother brandom says I had the little vision or I don't want to call it a translation I never had a vision like that I was I was standing up there looking at it looking back at myself here recently many of you read it in the magazines and things friends you can't afford to miss that just don't do it now there is something there I was there just as I am here looking back in myself I've had Visions I know what Visions are if that was a vision it was the strangest one I ever had and I seen the people ones that's gone on I seen them there the old was young and they were standing there human beings just like I am only without sin it was beyond Perfection Sublime you just couldn't mention what it was and when I knew that I had to return back there was only one thing that I would return to try to persuade the people whatever you do don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it you can't afford to miss it everything else let everything else go but make ready for that see whatever you do brother brandom as he got that opportunity to go across the curtain of time he comes back and he tells all of us it's worth it the price is worth it the reward at the end is worth any price it's worth anything that you go through it's worth any bit of pain it's worth any bit of discomfort it's worth any trial any test any sorrow yes yes the reward at the end is worth it Satan wants to keep going going asking the question over and over is it worth it is it worth it is what you're G to get at the end actually worth you going through this is it worth you making these decisions and living a life like this you could go you could go the other way and you could live like any other denomination out there you could go and live just like anyone else you don't have to go wild into the world doing drugs and those kind of things like I said you can live a Christian quote life you could go out and still live what pretty much anyone in the world would classify is a good life and you could take the easier road is the cost of what you're doing now is the cost of what you're experiencing now is the cost of what you face dayt day worth it brother brandom speaking in said Paul Raider how many ever heard of Paul Raider though I used to hear him preach when I was a little boy little did I know that I'd take his song only believe around the world when Paul was dying out there they had a little quartet come down from Moody Bible school you know what Paul said to a friend of mine when he know he was dying he had cancer he said if I would have took my message of Grace and swed it to the red hot Pentecostals instead of come here I'd have been better off so moody you know Paul had a sense of humor he and brother Bosworth and all of them were just bosom friends Billy Sunday brother Bosworth had a meeting up there one time in Chicago Raider Tabernacle and so Billy Sund been there three weeks and he' preached out all his sermons and he Paul had been there about two years and he was preaching on so Billy said to Paul he said Paul when do you ever run out of sermons he said when I get a kink in the hose and if anybody ever heard Paul preach he would start in Genesis and wind up in Revelation he' he'd preach the whole Bible through every time he preach I used to watch him he'd take something in his mind he'd get way back great big man he he'd pull up his trousers you know and here he come running as hard as he could and almost go over the top of the pulpit like a big bear with his hands out but when he was dying out there Moody Bible School sent down a quart head and they were standing there with the shades all down in the hospital singing Nearer My God to thee Paul raised up and he said hey who's dying me or you he said raise them shade sing me some some good gospel Snappy gospel songs so they began to sing down at the cross where my savior died and he said where is Luke that's his brother many of you know Luke he just recently went Luke and Paul were two brothers that stayed together something like Billy and my son and I said where is Luke Luke was in the Next Room he didn't want to see his brother die said just tell Luke to come over here they brought Luke in Luke trying to choke it back Paul raised up took hold of his hand said Luke we've been through many a Battle together haven't we brother he said yes Paul he said think of it in 5 minutes from now I'll be standing in the presence of Jesus Christ clothed in his righteousness GL let me go like that let me go with that testimony like Moody had let me go with a testimony like Paul had I have fought a good fight I have finished the course death where is your stain grave where is your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory in adoption number three brother brandom's telling a story he said I'd like to be like when old Peter was set in the prison there was a little boy in there and he was all nervous he said oh what's the matter he said you know you're going to be executed Peter said yep he said well you're fixing to die today he said yep he said well well aren't you afraid he said nope he said you must be one of them called the Christians he said yep said what happened and he told him he sit down and told him the story and as it went on came down he said and I could have been free this morning I could have went and joined some of their denominations just lived on see I could have been free but I started out the gate of the city and I seen one coming walking in I know who he was I said Lord where are you going he said I'm going back to be crucified again said I come right on back just then they said whose name is Simon Peter he said here I am said we're ready for you said I've been waiting for you walked right on out that boy touched him on the shoulder and said wait a minute Simon I accept that God too and now I'm Not Afraid let mine be the next one that's right Hallelujah all right Isaiah 53 and verse one it says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed every day of our life you'll have to answer the question is the prize worth the price is the reward worth the cost no one can answer it for you you have to be able to answer the question on your own sometimes you need to ask those that have gone on before to get that little bit of encouragement was it worth it with all the struggles and trials that you faced was it worth it all right has it been worth the pain that you've gone through has it been worth every step of the journey brother durren you've gone through a few things and you're still going through things is it worth it with all the he issues that you deal with with all the struggles you've gone through over the years and I don't know most of them I've only heard a few of the stories is it actually worth it we can go through so many of the different Elders that are here brother Ken you've been through a few things you've had a few experiences and here you sit is it worth it brother Torrance is it worth it you know I can I can come up here and give you the quotes give you the scriptures and I can tell you from my standpoint that it's worth it I'm still on the younger side yes I turned 40 and every Elder here's going oh that's a young guy you know I can stand here and I can say with what I've experienced I don't know how much more I have to go I don't know if the Lord Carri us to the point where I'm here at the age these Elders are but they've been through more of life's journey and so if you can go to them and they can look at you and they can say yes it's worth it yes every step of the way it's worth it every struggle every pain every sorrow it's worth it it's just like when you're taking that hike and you're asking those that have gone before and going okay is this actually worth it and your elders are sitting there and they're they're going yes yes it's worth it as the musicians come Hebrews 12 and verse 1 it says wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great of cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses amen this isn't a small cloud of witnesses this is a great cloud of witnesses those that have that have already gone on those that are there from the other side that are screaming at you and telling you it's worth it every step of the way the elders that have gone through their years of Trials and years of struggles and are still dealing with their own trials and struggles that are now sitting there and looking at us and looking at me yes as one of the younger group looking at the teenagers and children and going it is worth it yes the devil wants to look at you and go there's an easier route the devil wants you to accept that I could go out and do this little differently I don't want to be a manf follower I don't want to be wrapped up in what people would call a cult I don't want to do this I don't want to live a life like that I can take the easier route and get what I want but yet the elders look around and they go it is worth it it is worth every step of the way it's worth every step of the journey it's worth every pain every sorrow every struggle [Music] yes I can stand here at 40 and go up to age 40 I will fully say it's worth it I can't tell you beyond cuz I haven't experienced it yet I believe at this point it's worth it but I can look at my elders that are going and they're saying yes it's worth it yes it's worth the journey yes it's worth the struggles yes it's worth the [Music] pain but I can't answer the question for my son I can't answer the question for anyone else in this congregation you have to answer that on your own you have to get up every day and when Satan throws that question at you you have to be the one that's able to say yes it's worth it he's going to try to get you to reason it out he's going to try to give you all the reasons why you shouldn't he's going to give you the offer of the easier route he's going to give you the offer of the easier way and it comes down to you making that decision and being willing to fully accept and fully hold on to the fact that it is worth it it comes down to that seed on the inside that will hold you when you can't hold on yourself it comes down to the fact that you were with God from the very beginning which means you're going back to God the beginning so there's no way that you could ever say it's not worth it cuz you're simply going back to where you came from but it's still the same question that gets thrown at you every day every day is it worth it you know what you don't even have to go out into denomination you could be in this church and look like I'm holding on to everything but yet outside those doors I do whatever I want I listen to whatever music or I watch whatever shows or I do this or do that just because we walk through those doors and come into this building doesn't mean that we're everything that we should be Satan can tell you there's an easier route of just pretend three days a week three times a week it's not even a full day on Wednesday you can do three times a week you have to pretend take the easy route you can still be a Christian just take the easy [Music] way God calls us to go the hard way God calls us to run the race and God calls us to surrender everything and Satan keeps asking the question is it worth it have you counted the cost is it really worth [Music] everything are we going to be like Joshua and Caleb that stand there and go the land is mine and I'm taking it no matter the struggle no matter the battle no matter the fight no matter what I have to go through it's mine or do you take the route of the rest of the children of Israel go you know what it's not worth it the land is good yeah but it's not worth that price there's not enough value there there's not enough for me you have to count the cost you're the one as Jesus talked about that's building the tower is the do is the result result worth the price you have to pay are you willing to give everything are you willing to give it all or are you wanting to still hold on to no I want to have a little bit of control I still want to be a little bit of my own [Music] life you can be like aen and go hey I can take my own way cuz this will better my family I can do this type of Deal or I can work extra hours and miss church because I'm going to better my family with the gold and silver that I can get or do we hold on to the promise and the Commandments we've been given and we go you know what the prophet said every time the doors are open the scriptures say forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even so much as you see the end approaching do I believe that or do I think that these extra jobs or extra work or whatever is actually more valuable do I accept the instruction I've been given do I accept the present word the revealed word of this present day am I holding on to that is it worth it [Music] each one of us have to answer that brother Wendell doesn't get to come up and answer for us I don't get to answer for my son or for my wife I have to make that decision for myself and they have to make the decision for themselves and each of you have to make the decision for yourself on do you truly believe that the reward is worth the cost do you really believe that the prize is worth the price do you truly believe that it's worth your all that it's worth everything that you can give that you can surrender that it's worth skipping the easy path [Music] Lord Jesus we come before you this morning Lord [Music] and Lord I pray that you would take what was spoken Lord and Lord may it sink into our hearts Lord may it be something that we think about that we reflect on that [Music] Lord may it not just be a a Sunday sermon that we walk away from and never think about again Lord but and Lord even more so for myself being the one speaking it Lord let this not be something that that I would forget because I've delivered it I've spoken it now I can walk through the door and it isn't in my mind anymore Lord but Lord this is the challenge that you give us Lord you challenge us to to count the cost Lord and to make the decision is it worth it it's the question that Satan asks us over and over is it worth it and Lord we've seen over the years plenty of people that have made the decision that it's not worth it that have chosen to to turn away from the message of the hour Lord that have chosen to to turn away from Christianity have chosen to turn away from whatever it might be Lord I pray that you would help each one of us to examine ourselves Lord if there's someplace in our lives that we [Music] are that we're deciding hey you know what it's not fully worth it because I want to do this or I want to do that or I want to enjoy this part of the worldly life Lord may you be the one to provide the conviction Lord may you be the one to provide the correction Lord [Music] Jesus Lord if there's some place in my life Lord may I Surrender it to you Lord may I truly sell out the way that I should Lord Jesus to to be able to truly declare that it's worth it that every price that is paid that every worldly pleasure that we may have to surrender we may have to forgo or we may have to stay away [Music] from Lord we want to give everything to you Lord we want to live for you that we should we want to be living and your will Lord may you just continue to to work in our lives and draw us closer to you Lord may we truly give everything unto you Lord we just love you and we thank you Lord Jesus brother [Music] kby

he came back from across curtain curtain of time with that one Focus tell the people don't miss it no matter what no matter what you're dealing with don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it it was beyond Perfection it was Sublime as he described it don't miss it it's worth every single thing it's worth every price that you could pay it's worth every struggle every bit of P every bit of trial

are willing to surrender themselves Amen to uh to the to the headship of the word and um but it does require a a it it requires a decision you've got to make that decision you've got to make that clear-cut decision I remember the day that I I made the clearcut decision amen I'm going to kick that TV out of the house hey I was you know uh 21 years old and and of course we had we had never had a TV uh and then you know um our leadership uh you know and our our church uh um you know uh those those hell Visions would take you to hell and then and then the uh decision was made that we could all

and I thought you know hey I can so I man I moved to television in my house and and uh and then I after a while I I began to think I understand now why we don't have televisions amen the spirits the as a Young Man and the things that were going on and um and two I couldn't get my wife it was it was A House Divided I couldn't get her to come over and sit down and watch television with me and Kobe
