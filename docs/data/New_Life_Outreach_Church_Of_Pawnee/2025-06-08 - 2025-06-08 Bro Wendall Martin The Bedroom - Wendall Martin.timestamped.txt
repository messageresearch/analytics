[32:46] shall
[32:49] confess that
[32:54] Jesus
[32:56] Christ
[32:58] is Lord. Make it personal now.
[33:03] Oh, he's my
[33:07] [Laughter]
[33:10] Lord. Oh,
[33:12] he's my
[33:15] [Music]
[33:18] Lord. And
[33:20] he has
[33:22] risen from the
[33:26] dead. And he's my Lord.
[33:30] [Music]
[33:34] Oh, every
[33:37] knee
[33:39] shall
[33:41] bow and every
[33:45] tongue
[33:50] confess that
[33:54] Jesus Christ, oh, he's still Lord. You
[33:59] can make him Lord this morning and sing
[34:02] it one more time. For he is Lord.
[34:09] [Music]
[34:42] Oh,
[34:43] every
[34:47] time
[34:50] confess that Jesus
[34:55] [Music]
[35:00] Hallelujah. Can we just sing it one more
[35:03] time? Yes. He is
[35:08] Lord. He is
[35:12] Lord.
[35:14] He
[35:16] Lord. Yes.
[35:19] Yes. He has
[35:24] risen from the dead.
[35:28] And he is
[35:32] Lord.
[35:34] Oh
[35:36] every
[35:37] knee.
[35:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[35:43] every
[35:46] tongue
[35:51] confess that
[35:53] [Music]
[35:55] Jesus
[35:58] Christ is
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[36:08] I'm so
[36:10] thankful that in this day and in this
[36:14] generation that there is still something
[36:17] within the heart of man that is willing
[36:21] to make Jesus
[36:25] Lord. Lordship is is so incredible
[36:29] because it's it's giving it's giving of
[36:32] yourself over to him. It's it's
[36:35] accepting his viewpoints over
[36:38] yours.
[36:41] It's giving up your
[36:43] rights and saying, "Lord, here I
[36:46] am. Be to me what you would have
[36:52] uh want me to be. Reflect yourself
[36:54] through me." And I think it's a it's a
[36:58] wonderful day
[36:59] because the scripture says that he's
[37:02] calling a bride out of this day for his
[37:05] soon
[37:06] return. Giving of ourselves to him. Do
[37:10] you love him here
[37:11] tonight? I love him here
[37:14] tonight for this
[37:16] morning. Praise the Lord. So good to see
[37:19] everyone here today. And um Amen. Uh we
[37:25] are so thankful for God's amazing love
[37:28] to us and what crazy weather we have had
[37:31] this year, huh? And but it has been nice
[37:34] to be in June and and still have some
[37:37] cool mornings and cool evenings and and
[37:40] so that's been nice. Let's look here in
[37:43] the book of
[37:44] Revelations. Yeah, we're going to start
[37:46] Revelations 21 and1. appreciate brother
[37:50] Merl and the musicians this morning and
[37:54] uh sure enjoyed Len's song and uh Amen.

[38:04] she's right there. But uh so we
[38:06] appreciate u uh we love Len a whole
[38:10] bunch and we we sure appreciate uh all
[38:15] of God's blessings and all of God's
[38:17] people. Amen. And good good to see Bosow
[38:22] back there. God bless you. And uh just
[38:25] it's just been such so wonderful to have
[38:28] uh Patrick back in church and see the
[38:32] Lord uh blessing him and and uh and so
[38:36] we're of course Stacia and the baby and
[38:40] just just the whole family back there.
[38:43] And um you know um
[38:46] we look there at at uh Weston as he's
[38:50] growing up and and good good to see him
[38:53] coming to church. And so we're just glad
[38:56] for what God's doing to for the family.
[39:01] And um so let's look here at Revelations
[39:05] 21 and then we'll let you have your
[39:06] seats.
[39:08] It says, "I saw a new heaven and a new
[39:11] earth, for the first heaven and the
[39:12] first earth were passed
[39:14] away, and there were no more sea, and I,
[39:18] John, saw the holy city, Jerusalem,
[39:22] coming down from God out of heaven,
[39:24] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[39:28] husband. And I heard a great voice out
[39:31] of heaven, saying, Behold, the
[39:33] tabernacle of God is with men. He will
[39:36] dwell with them and they shall be his
[39:38] people and God himself shall be with
[39:41] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[39:45] away all their
[39:47] tears all tears from their eyes and
[39:50] there shall be no more death neither
[39:53] sorrow near nor crying neither shall
[39:55] there be any pain for the former things
[39:58] are passed away and he that sat upon the
[40:01] throne be said behold I make all things
[40:04] new and he said unto me night for these
[40:06] things are true and faithful. And he
[40:09] said unto me, it is done. I am Alpha and
[40:11] Omega of the beginning and the end. I
[40:13] will give unto him that is a thirst of
[40:16] the fountain of water of life freely. He
[40:19] that overcomemeth shall inherit all
[40:21] things, and I will be his God, and he
[40:24] shall be my sons.
[40:28] And but the fearful and unbelieving and
[40:30] abominable and murderers and whoreongers
[40:34] and sorcerers and idolattors and liars
[40:37] shall have their part in the lake which
[40:39] burns with fire and
[40:41] brimstone, which is the the second
[40:44] death. And there came unto me one of the
[40:48] seven angels which had the seven vials
[40:50] of the seven last plagues, and talked
[40:53] with me, saying, Come hither, and I will
[40:56] show thee the bride, the lamb's wife.
[41:00] And he carried me away in the spirit to
[41:02] a great and high mountain, and showed me
[41:05] that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
[41:08] descending out of heaven from God,
[41:10] having the glory of God. And her light
[41:13] was like unto stone, most precious, even
[41:16] like as jasper stone. Crystal, a clear
[41:20] as crystal. And we're just going to uh
[41:24] stop right there. And I want to minister
[41:29] a little bit this morning on the on the
[41:32] bride o of Jesus and the invisible union
[41:36] of the bride. Aren't you glad that there
[41:39] is a a a union? Amen. That God is is
[41:43] making the bride ready. Let's go to the
[41:46] Lord in prayer. Father, we want to thank
[41:48] you for your many blessings and for your
[41:53] presence that we feel here this morning.
[41:56] And I pray, Lord, that you would uh come
[41:58] in a in in a in a real special way like
[42:02] only you can, Lord. For Lord, you're the
[42:05] one who Lord, who can make all things
[42:09] new. And we ask Lord that you would uh
[42:13] just be here in a real special way.
[42:16] Dad's not feeling well this morning at
[42:18] home and and I'm asking Lord that you
[42:21] help him. Father having a hard time
[42:23] keeping the oxygen up today. I just ask
[42:26] Lord that you would breathe into him and
[42:29] that you would help him today Lord. Oh
[42:32] God, we look to you and we thank you for
[42:35] your goodness. Thank you Lord for the
[42:38] miracles Lord. Thank you for the
[42:39] healings that are in process now.
[42:42] Father, we report for duty today. We ask
[42:45] Lord that you would speak through your
[42:46] servant. In Jesus name we pray. Can the
[42:50] church say amen? Amen. And amen. God
[42:53] bless you. You may be seated.
[42:56] We have talked a little bit uh about the
[43:00] the
[43:02] um these this old body of this old house
[43:06] of clay that we that we live in and and
[43:10] um lots of lots of uh uh you know things
[43:16] that that that we go through and and um
[43:21] man uh we as we live in this old in this
[43:25] veil of
[43:26] flesh. But yet the new birth has done
[43:30] something so incredibly different in us.
[43:34] And of course we understand that our
[43:36] relationship with God is not just
[43:40] attending a church service. It is not um
[43:44] uh living a uh living a better life. But
[43:49] our relationship with the Lord is is
[43:52] there is a genuine process that has
[43:54] taken place. We have entered in to a
[43:58] relationship with the Lord. Amen. We are
[44:01] his bride. Amen. Not we are not a church
[44:06] member but we are the bride of Jesus
[44:09] Christ. That is we have been chosen of
[44:12] the Lord. We have been called of the
[44:14] Lord. And the Lord has amen come in this
[44:19] day and has performed a marriage. It's
[44:22] called the invisible union of the bride
[44:25] of Christ. We're not going to be
[44:28] married, but we are joining with him in
[44:32] marriage through his word. His word is
[44:36] becomes our absolute. We become
[44:38] impregnated. our heart becomes
[44:40] impregnated with his word. So when we
[44:44] talk about the the the tabernacle as we
[44:48] did on Wednesday night that there were
[44:50] the outer courts and there was the holy
[44:53] place and the most holy place and then
[44:55] we took that as the believer that you
[44:59] are a three room house body spirit and
[45:03] soul. Amen. Now you're still going to
[45:05] work with in the body. You're still
[45:08] using the spirit to think and to
[45:11] communicate. Amen. What you think then
[45:13] you speak. You have the five gates of
[45:15] the of of the of communication with of
[45:19] your body. Seeing, tasting, feeling, uh
[45:23] hearing, amen, eyesight. You you've got
[45:27] those five channels that you communicate
[45:30] with. And then you've got the five
[45:32] channels of your spirit man. It's your
[45:35] imagination. And as as I said the other
[45:38] night, I heard someone say one time, "My
[45:40] car." Amen. So if you just remember that
[45:43] M for memory, imagination, and and then
[45:46] it goes on down conscience and
[45:48] affections and and you you you work
[45:52] through those spirits. That's that's
[45:54] your the invisible realm there. But the
[45:57] inside of the inside is where is where
[46:02] God comes in. And there is something
[46:04] that takes place. The new birth takes
[46:07] place there. It comes from the genuine
[46:09] word seed. Um being impregnated in your
[46:14] heart. Amen. There is a change that
[46:17] takes place. Jesus was telling them as
[46:20] he was fixing to to go to Calvary, John
[46:24] 15 and 15. and and that whole that whole
[46:27] scripture is is wonderful because he is
[46:31] he is uh preparing them and telling them
[46:34] that I'm I I'm I'm I'm going but there's
[46:38] going to be uh the my my spirit I'm
[46:42] going to come and live within that third
[46:44] compartment. I'm going to live in the
[46:46] bedroom of your three- room house. Amen.
[46:50] I'm going to and and he says there in
[46:53] John 15:15, "Henceforth I call you not
[46:56] servants, for the servant knows not what
[46:58] his Lord does, but I have called you
[47:02] friends. For all things that I have
[47:05] heard of my father, I have made known
[47:08] unto you." This was going to be a
[47:11] relationship change. Amen. A servant is
[47:14] I you I want you to listen to me. I want
[47:17] you to do what I'm telling you to do.
[47:19] Amen. And and he sent them from place to
[47:22] place. He he was they they were his
[47:24] servant. They were coming reporting for
[47:26] duty. But here he is expressing
[47:30] something. He is revealing himself,
[47:33] letting them know the full plan. He was
[47:37] things were fixing to open up to them.
[47:40] things that don't happen. Amen. In in
[47:43] the kitchen or the the living room, but
[47:46] there was fixing to be h a a a
[47:50] revelation of himself, his word unto
[47:54] them. Amen. And and I I want to say that
[47:58] in this day, the word that has come is
[48:02] is more than just God sending a prophet.
[48:04] Now, we're thankful for that word of a
[48:06] prophet, but don't get hung up. Don't
[48:09] get hung up, Amen. on the on the outer
[48:12] veil of of what God was bringing. Don't
[48:15] get hung up on the flesh because that is
[48:18] that was simply uh uh the vessel that
[48:22] God used to bring that word to us. Amen.
[48:26] And and and uh but the word that was
[48:28] brought to us in in in this day is to is
[48:32] is from a changing it was a a changing
[48:36] of of dispensations. We have gone
[48:38] through the son of man uh uh we uh the
[48:42] son of god dispensation through the holy
[48:45] ghost uh uh uh uh through these seven
[48:47] church ages. But the promise was right
[48:50] before the coming of the lord that it
[48:53] would be the revealing of the son of
[48:55] man. It would be the word taking on a
[48:59] body again. Not just organizations, not
[49:03] just attending a church, but there would
[49:05] be literally a marriage take place
[49:10] between the word and the flesh. And that
[49:14] there would be flesh becoming word as it
[49:17] was with Jesus Christ. Jesus was the
[49:21] fulfillment of all of the Old Testament.
[49:25] He was the fulfillment of everything God
[49:28] was doing. All of the words, all of the
[49:31] types, all of the shadows, everything of
[49:34] the Old Testament was now going to be
[49:37] bodily in the body of Jesus Christ.
[49:41] Amen. So when you seen Jesus, the body,
[49:46] Amen. the the the the flesh, then you
[49:49] could see the word of God because the
[49:52] word had married. The word and flesh had
[49:56] united together. Amen. He was the
[49:59] product of a virgin birth. Amen. Are you
[50:02] with me? Amen. And so he was not a
[50:06] servant though he done nothing except
[50:09] the father for showing. He was not a
[50:12] Amen. He was he was the God of glory
[50:17] revealed in flesh. He had the
[50:20] preeminence of God within him. Amen. Now
[50:25] as we talk about this changing, amen, we
[50:28] are we we ourselves have have gone in
[50:32] justification, sanctification, baptism
[50:35] of the Holy Ghost, then the word
[50:37] becoming a having the preeminence within
[50:40] our hearts. Amen. And and and we've gone
[50:43] through those stages, but God is not
[50:46] wanting us to be servants. God's wanting
[50:48] us to be his bride. Amen. He wants us to
[50:51] be his bride. And with that with that
[50:54] new birth, amen, you are now married to
[50:57] the son of man. You're united with the
[51:01] word, impregnated with the word. And
[51:05] there is a change of mindset. Amen.
[51:08] You're when a person the the the the
[51:12] the change of position is everything.
[51:15] And I think this is something that I I I
[51:17] I really want to stress this morning.
[51:20] the changing of position. Amen. Because
[51:24] if we don't get that, I I I feel that
[51:28] we're not really catching what God is
[51:30] trying to say to the believer because
[51:33] the re the reality that God is wanting
[51:36] in every one of us. He is wanting an
[51:39] Adam and Eve that knows the father's
[51:43] will, does nothing but the father's will
[51:46] and and can take dominion and authority
[51:50] here on the earth. Amen. Now, you can't
[51:53] do that if you're identifying with the
[51:56] person that you're seeing in the mirror.
[51:58] You cannot do that if you are
[52:00] identifying. Amen. Uh with your with
[52:03] your spirit, imaginations, affections,
[52:06] amen, conscience, memories. Remember
[52:09] those two go hand in hand. Body and
[52:11] spirit goes hand in hand. But the Holy
[52:14] Spirit through the opening of the word
[52:17] is now going to separate. Amen. Is going
[52:20] to divide the soul from that spirit
[52:24] flesh realm. Amen. The word of the day.
[52:28] Remember there in in in Hebrews 4, it is
[52:31] to separate a sunder, separate, divide.
[52:35] Amen. The God part from the human part.
[52:40] Amen. God was going to separate that so
[52:42] that you can understand where where we
[52:46] are. Hallelujah. Now, it did not say
[52:48] that the word was going to separate
[52:50] spirit from body. Amen. So, you're never
[52:53] going to get to the point to where this
[52:56] body is not going to be affected by your
[52:58] imagination, your memory, and your
[53:00] reasonings. It'll never get there. I
[53:02] don't care how spiritual you get. I
[53:05] don't care how big of a preacher you
[53:06] are. I don't care how wonderful of a
[53:09] singer you are. I don't care how much of
[53:11] an angel you be. You will never separate
[53:16] your spirit, your conscience, memory,
[53:18] affections from your body.
[53:22] But there will be a separation from that
[53:26] soul. And that soul was the one that was
[53:29] made in the image of God. God made that
[53:32] soul in his very own image. And he gave
[53:36] the soul, not the spirit, not the body.
[53:38] He gave the soul the dominion over the
[53:43] devil. Well, hallelujah. Amen. Can you
[53:46] say amen? So when this when this
[53:49] revelation comes the revealing of the
[53:52] son of man again what was the son of man
[53:54] in the old testament a son of man was
[53:56] the prophet it was the word made clear
[53:59] to the prophet and the prophet revealed
[54:02] it to the people it was the word made
[54:05] clear to uh to Isaiah a virgin shall
[54:08] conceive. Amen. And that word circled
[54:10] the globe for 800 years and then it
[54:13] lodged into the womb of Mary. Amen. And
[54:16] there when the angel came and said uh
[54:19] beh you you are highly favored among all
[54:22] women and you're going to produce this
[54:24] word child. And she said be it unto me
[54:27] according to thy word. Can you say amen?
[54:30] So this this this word that has come
[54:33] today. Amen. Is a changing amen. It's a
[54:36] it's a changing of position. Somebody
[54:39] say a changing of position.
[54:42] I'm not a servant. I'm not a church
[54:44] member. I'm the bride of Jesus Christ.
[54:47] Amen. Now, you cannot be a ruler and
[54:51] then be be be uh uh uh uh moved by every
[54:55] circumstance that comes around. The word
[54:59] is the ruler. The word is the authority.
[55:03] The word is our everything. It's our all
[55:06] and all. Can you say amen? Amen. It can
[55:10] never be changed. It should never be
[55:12] changed. It's got to be thus saith the
[55:15] Lord. And that word must be carried out.
[55:18] Amen. That's right. Amen. A change. A
[55:22] changing. It's a it's it's it's a
[55:24] revolution. It's it's it's an
[55:26] establishment. It's it's an established
[55:29] uh uh a a new set of of of attitudes.
[55:33] It's Amen. It's it it becomes the the
[55:36] the the thought pattern that will defeat
[55:39] the devil. Amen. Now, brother Brandham
[55:42] in the first seal, he would say he he
[55:44] said it would be known in this last
[55:46] days, but it comes forth in a church
[55:48] symbol. You understand a church, you you
[55:51] it comes forth a symbol of a church that
[55:54] that they know there is a seal, but
[55:56] that's that uh but just what it is yet,
[55:58] they don't know because it's just a
[56:00] white horse rider. It's only to be
[56:02] revealed in the last day when this
[56:04] actual seal is broke. Broken to who? Not
[56:07] to Christ cuz Christ already knows who
[56:10] it is. But to the church. Oh my, that
[56:14] just makes me tremble. I hope that the
[56:16] church truly understands it. See what I
[56:18] mean? You people, I'm going to call you
[56:22] bride so that you understand it. Amen.
[56:27] So, he's letting us know now God is not
[56:29] doing these things in the last day for
[56:32] himself. He's doing it for you because
[56:36] he's wanting to lift you up out of this
[56:40] flesh so that the word can have dominion
[56:44] in you like it did in Jesus Christ.
[56:48] Jesus Christ was the bridegroom and you
[56:50] are his bride. Jesus was the f word made
[56:54] flesh and so is the bride. Word made
[56:58] flesh. Amen. Now y'all remember that.
[57:02] Amen. So remember the the three sons
[57:05] names there. There was Jesus was to come
[57:08] a as as the son of man. That's God in a
[57:11] body. Then he was to come as amen as as
[57:16] a son of God. That's the Holy Ghost in
[57:18] the church. Amen. Perfecting his church,
[57:21] bringing his church up. And then he is
[57:24] also supposed to be uh the son of David.
[57:27] And he which would be sitting on the
[57:29] throne of David. But he's promised right
[57:32] before the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[57:35] Right before the millennium, there must
[57:38] come again the revelation of God in
[57:43] human flesh. Just as Jesus time on the
[57:46] earth was a small time. It was God on
[57:50] God in flesh. And so will it be today.
[57:53] It will be God in flesh right before the
[57:57] coming of the Lord. Amen. And I I want
[58:00] to tell you God can't be in your flesh
[58:02] and the power of God not reside. God
[58:04] cannot be in your flesh. Amen. If if God
[58:08] dwells in you, if his word has
[58:10] authority, then it has authority over
[58:13] your mind. Amen. It has authority on
[58:17] your feelings. It has authority over
[58:19] your attitudes. It has authority over it
[58:23] all. For God is still all powerful.
[58:27] Religion won't do it. You can't have
[58:29] authority if you're just religious.
[58:32] Amen. But that that one that knows all
[58:34] things has all power. Well, glory to
[58:37] God. Now remember, so the end time
[58:40] prophecy is for Jesus and his bride is
[58:44] to be married. Amen. Now, now, Brother
[58:47] Brandham would say in proving his word,
[58:49] he says, "Now remember, Amen. Uh, he
[58:51] says, "We're not talking." It was not
[58:53] Jesus talking to Abraham there who could
[58:56] discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind
[58:58] behind him. It was not Jesus. He had not
[59:00] yet been born. But it was a man in human
[59:04] flesh. A that Abraham called Elohim, the
[59:08] Almighty, the great Almighty, showing
[59:11] that Jesus said, "As it was in the days
[59:13] of Sodom, now watch close. In the days
[59:15] of Sodom, so will it be in the coming of
[59:18] the Son of Man when the Son of Man is
[59:21] being revealed. Not no more a church.
[59:23] See, not no more the bride is called. In
[59:27] that day, the son of man will be
[59:30] revealed. What? To join the church to
[59:33] the head. Unite the marriage of the
[59:36] bride. The bridegroom call will come
[59:39] right through this. When the son of man
[59:41] will come down, come in human flesh to
[59:44] unite the two together. The church has
[59:47] to be the word. He is the word and the
[59:50] two unites together. And to do that,
[59:52] it'll take the manifestation of the
[59:54] revealing of the son of man, not a
[59:56] clergyman. Amen. He's see it's um son of
[1:00:00] man Jesus Christ coming down in human
[1:00:03] flesh among us will make his word so
[1:00:05] real that it'll unite the church and him
[1:00:08] has won the bride. Then she'll go to the
[1:00:11] wedding supper. See she's Amen. She's
[1:00:14] already united. See we go to the wedding
[1:00:18] supper not the marriage. The rapture is
[1:00:21] going to the supper. When the word here
[1:00:24] unites with the uh uh with the person,
[1:00:28] they too become one. Well, praise the
[1:00:31] Lord. Amen. Are you understanding? He
[1:00:34] says the son of man, the word and the
[1:00:38] church becomes one. And whatever the son
[1:00:41] of man done, he was the word. The church
[1:00:44] does the same thing. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:48] So now what has taken place? This is why
[1:00:51] we've got to live in that those you you
[1:00:55] can h you've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:56] Ghost, but you've got to live.
[1:00:59] Hallelujah. Amen. I I know the these
[1:01:02] days there's a lot of you know, you can
[1:01:03] have your bedroom, but man, there's
[1:01:04] there's sleeping in the living room and
[1:01:06] and you know, but but bed bedroom is for
[1:01:09] rest. Amen. There's there's where you
[1:01:12] go. Uh uh you that that's that place of
[1:01:15] rest and relaxation. Can you say amen?
[1:01:18] Amen. Amen. where God's word is is
[1:01:22] becomes you, where you take the word of
[1:01:27] God into your heart, where you become so
[1:01:30] impregnated with the words of life that
[1:01:33] it begins to dictate who you are. It you
[1:01:37] it be you you it becomes it becomes the
[1:01:41] life of God in you. Now you are still
[1:01:45] living in that body that you're that
[1:01:48] that you've always lived in. Can you say
[1:01:51] amen?
[1:01:53] Hallelujah. You're you're still living
[1:01:55] there. Amen. You're still fighting
[1:01:57] battles. You're still you've still got
[1:02:00] emotions, good and bad. You've still got
[1:02:03] these things that that that you are
[1:02:06] fighting. But the word of God has come
[1:02:09] to you. The word of God has claimed you.
[1:02:14] The word of God has separated you from
[1:02:18] the wrath of God that is to come. It's
[1:02:21] God's word that has separated you. Your
[1:02:26] flesh and spirit separated you from that
[1:02:29] eternal soul.
[1:02:32] Hallelujah. Can you say amen? That's why
[1:02:35] we stay behind the word. We stay behind
[1:02:39] the word. Now, and I'm not I'm not
[1:02:42] talking about staying behind the word.
[1:02:43] Well, I got baptized, right? I got I got
[1:02:46] uh you know, I'm I'm baptized in Jesus
[1:02:49] name. I I've I I I'm I'm doing the
[1:02:52] holiness. I'm living in holiness as far
[1:02:54] as what God has required me to do in
[1:02:56] this body. Amen. I I I
[1:02:59] I've God says it's an abomination for a
[1:03:02] woman to wear uh man's apparel, which is
[1:03:04] pants. So, the woman is saying, "Yes, my
[1:03:07] Lord, I am not going to wear pants. So
[1:03:09] help me. Amen. You'll never see another
[1:03:12] pair of pants on me because God says
[1:03:14] it's an abomination. And every one that
[1:03:16] does abomination will have their part in
[1:03:18] the lake of fire. Amen. But you see,
[1:03:21] we're beyond that now. Amen. We We're
[1:03:24] living the way God's asked. God God says
[1:03:26] for a woman to keep her hair long and
[1:03:29] and a guy to keep his hair short. That's
[1:03:31] what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 11.
[1:03:33] We're no longer arguing about that. That
[1:03:36] is that's that's what the Bible says.
[1:03:38] The word has preeminence over us. The
[1:03:42] Bible says, Amen. Does not even nature
[1:03:45] teach you that it is a shame for a man
[1:03:48] to wear long hair? Amen. He says, it
[1:03:51] says it's a shame for a man to wear long
[1:03:54] hair. The Bible says it's a shame for a
[1:03:57] woman to wear that and and to look like
[1:04:00] a man. This is and and and listen to be
[1:04:02] honest with you. Amen. We wouldn't have
[1:04:04] this problem today that we have with
[1:04:07] this with with this uh uh uh gender
[1:04:10] identification. We wouldn't have we
[1:04:12] wouldn't have 64 Jennifer uh Hallelujah.
[1:04:16] gender
[1:04:17] identifications. Hallelujah. Yeah. 64
[1:04:20] Jennifer. Amen. But there is there
[1:04:22] there's all these identifications
[1:04:24] because the word has no has no effect
[1:04:28] upon the people. Satan has full control
[1:04:32] of this world. Amen. That's right. But
[1:04:35] only the elect will the word have that
[1:04:38] effect in. It'll affect the way you
[1:04:41] dress. It'll affect the way you're
[1:04:43] baptized. It'll affect the way you go to
[1:04:46] church. It'll affect Amen. It it will ch
[1:04:49] the word will have will will will will
[1:04:52] will change you if you're a Christian
[1:04:55] because if you're going to be my
[1:04:57] disciples. He says if you're going to
[1:04:59] follow after me, take up your cross and
[1:05:03] follow me just as I Amen. as a man am
[1:05:08] taking up my cross and going to Calvary
[1:05:11] to die the death. I'm doing that because
[1:05:16] God in me is looking for redemption.
[1:05:20] Amen. And if you're going to follow me,
[1:05:23] you're going to be my bride. Then you're
[1:05:25] going to have to take up your cross and
[1:05:28] you've got to follow me as I am
[1:05:31] following God. Amen. Jesus would
[1:05:35] separate himself from God. I do nothing
[1:05:38] except the father first show me. But yet
[1:05:41] he was God. The scripture says he was
[1:05:44] the fullness of God in a body.
[1:05:49] But that body, we looked at the body,
[1:05:52] they looked at the body, they were mad
[1:05:54] at the body, they were trying to stone
[1:05:57] the body, they c kicked the body out of
[1:06:00] their churches. Amen. They killed the
[1:06:03] body. And he was the very god in flesh.
[1:06:09] Can you say amen? Amen. But his will was
[1:06:12] to do the will of God. And so is it with
[1:06:15] the bride. Amen. There is a union with
[1:06:18] that word. My meat, my desire, my
[1:06:23] craving is to do the will of God. Amen.
[1:06:27] I don't want my will. I don't care what
[1:06:30] that one says or that one says. I want
[1:06:33] God's word to have the absolute supreme
[1:06:36] authority in everything that I am.
[1:06:40] Can you say amen? Amen. But you see, we
[1:06:44] can go through that sanctification
[1:06:45] process and many times it becomes a
[1:06:49] religious order. We learning how we're
[1:06:52] to act. We're learning how we're to live
[1:06:55] and we fail to realize that God is
[1:06:59] wanting intimacy. Okay? that God is not
[1:07:03] wanting it to be rigid dos and don'ts,
[1:07:06] but it's the word to be made flesh in
[1:07:11] us.
[1:07:13] Amen. See, you can put on, you ladies
[1:07:17] can put on the skirt and still have a
[1:07:20] bad attitude about it. You can come to
[1:07:23] church and still have a bad attitude
[1:07:24] about it. Praise the Lord. Amen. Some of
[1:07:28] us are just going to get here late.
[1:07:29] Don't matter what the preacher says,
[1:07:30] brother Brandham says. It doesn't matter
[1:07:31] if an angel from God come down. It's
[1:07:33] just going to happen. It's the attitude
[1:07:35] about it. There's just a different
[1:07:36] attitude. God is it's just not important
[1:07:39] to come in and pray before. It's just
[1:07:40] not important. Amen. It's just it's just
[1:07:43] not there. And God's not interested in
[1:07:46] you coming to church. He wants an
[1:07:48] attitude change. He He don't care about
[1:07:51] this that well, I'm doing this. Well,
[1:07:53] I'm I'm there and I'm there. That's not
[1:07:55] what God's looking for. It's the
[1:07:58] attitude where we surrender to his word
[1:08:04] where our word is his word where we have
[1:08:08] that intimate time. Amen. Because his
[1:08:11] word is fixing to come and we don't want
[1:08:13] to just hear it here and make mental
[1:08:15] notes. We want it touching way down in
[1:08:18] our soul. We want to be impregnated.
[1:08:23] Spirit accepts it with the memory,
[1:08:25] conscience, and reasonings. It's got all
[1:08:26] that up here. Amen. We got too many
[1:08:29] that's accepting it. But the where it
[1:08:31] comes and separates it. There is where
[1:08:34] the passion of of the word is born is
[1:08:39] through the word seed itself.
[1:08:43] See, God's not looking at the dos and
[1:08:45] don'ts like we do. He's looking at
[1:08:49] impregnation of his
[1:08:51] word because it's only the word that
[1:08:55] separates us. The scripture says we are
[1:08:58] born again by the word, the
[1:09:02] incorruptible seed, not of the
[1:09:04] corruptible seed, the sexual seed, but
[1:09:07] of the incorruptible seed. So man, the
[1:09:10] Bible says the enmity uh the mind of man
[1:09:13] is enmity against God. It'll never
[1:09:17] accept it. It'll take it. It'll take it
[1:09:20] in the one, two, threes. But the mind
[1:09:23] cannot understand the nature of God. It
[1:09:26] just cannot do it. The nature of God,
[1:09:29] the living word is what took place in
[1:09:32] Jesus Christ. His passion was God. His
[1:09:38] passion led him. His the word become the
[1:09:43] very passion of Jesus Christ. And so
[1:09:46] will the word become the passion of the
[1:09:49] bride of Jesus.
[1:09:52] Oh, glory to God. Now, let me tell you
[1:09:55] this
[1:09:56] morning, someone say, "I love you,
[1:09:58] Brother Wend."
[1:10:00] Hallelujah. I want to tell you, you were
[1:10:04] not always a
[1:10:05] virgin. There's not a virgin that is in
[1:10:08] this
[1:10:09] building. You say, "Oh, now don't you
[1:10:12] start that with me, preacher." Amen.
[1:10:14] Hallelujah. I don't care how. I don't
[1:10:17] care if you saved yourself before
[1:10:18] marriage. Amen. You were born in
[1:10:23] corruption. We were all born speaking
[1:10:26] lies. We were all born as harlots to the
[1:10:31] word. Amen. We are we had other thoughts
[1:10:35] in our minds, other thoughts in our
[1:10:38] hearts. We were we were we were going
[1:10:41] from opinion to opinion. Amen. When we
[1:10:44] talk about the seed of God, the
[1:10:47] reproduction, Amen. that the seed, the
[1:10:50] living life, the sperm of God, it come
[1:10:54] from the word of God. He is the word. He
[1:10:58] spoke, amen, into the womb of Mary. And
[1:11:02] there was a seed that impregnated her
[1:11:06] heart and she produced Jesus Christ.
[1:11:11] the word. Are you hearing me? When when
[1:11:14] when you talk about the loins of God,
[1:11:17] we're talking about the word of God.
[1:11:19] We're talking about the Hallelujah. the
[1:11:22] sperm of God, the lifegiving source of
[1:11:25] God, the
[1:11:27] reproductive part of God is his word.
[1:11:32] True.
[1:11:34] That's why we can't take your opinion
[1:11:37] and your daddy's opinion and your
[1:11:39] grandpa's opinion. And you can't take my
[1:11:42] opinion.
[1:11:44] You must take God's
[1:11:46] God. And God alone has the ability to
[1:11:51] reproduce himself, not a church.
[1:11:57] Churches can reproduce church members.
[1:12:02] Oh man, I'm sick of church members.
[1:12:05] Amen. The world is full of church
[1:12:07] members. I don't want to. Don't even put
[1:12:09] me in the category of a church member. I
[1:12:12] am the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:16] The bride where the life of God is in me
[1:12:20] pulsating his word.
[1:12:23] Well, can you say amen?
[1:12:26] Hallelujah. Oh, don't ever don't don't
[1:12:28] ever say, "Oh, you're a member of the
[1:12:30] new life." No, I'm not. I'm a member of
[1:12:33] the bride. Amen. I attend church at New
[1:12:36] Life, but I am the
[1:12:39] member. Oh, can you say amen? I don't I
[1:12:43] don't have my fellowship here or I have
[1:12:45] my fellowship here, but I have my union
[1:12:48] there.
[1:12:49] Come on.
[1:12:52] And don't and and don't don't don't and
[1:12:54] don't you worry. you ever have a union
[1:12:56] with him, all of these all of these
[1:12:59] other things that that that seems not to
[1:13:01] matter becomes our everything because we
[1:13:03] have his word and his word becomes our
[1:13:06] passion even to the very minute. Can you
[1:13:10] say amen?
[1:13:12] But see, you were not always that way.
[1:13:14] It took it took that word within you.
[1:13:17] Amen. That's right. See, God did not
[1:13:20] call you because you were a virgin. He
[1:13:23] made you a virgin through that new
[1:13:25] birth, that new seed. That's what made
[1:13:28] you a virgin. You were born again and
[1:13:31] you'll never ever ever ever be a virgin
[1:13:34] in this hybrid because well, praise the
[1:13:37] Lord. G the Bible calls it here because
[1:13:39] we are all bastard born. That's what the
[1:13:43] Bible says. Hallelujah. We were all
[1:13:45] bastard born. But God's not wanting us
[1:13:48] to stay. God so loved us, so called us,
[1:13:52] put his seed within us. Amen. And that
[1:13:56] seed uh would be become a living seed
[1:14:00] and there was a new man that was born
[1:14:03] and that's what God is coming after.
[1:14:07] How can you say, man? How can you say
[1:14:09] that you've got that that eternal gene
[1:14:12] seed, that that eternal word seed of God
[1:14:14] being born in us, and that we're still
[1:14:16] wanting to commit adultery? We're still
[1:14:17] wanting to fornicate. We're still
[1:14:19] wanting, Amen. to lie and those things.
[1:14:21] What we need is a birth on the inside.
[1:14:25] It'll change you.
[1:14:30] Well, can you say amen?
[1:14:33] The prophet Hosea was told
[1:14:36] to go marry a prostitute by the name of
[1:14:40] Goomer.
[1:14:41] And this was this was this was out
[1:14:44] there. Amen. God God told the prophet.
[1:14:50] Now, God God didn't even want God God
[1:14:52] forbid any of his children to marry
[1:14:55] prostitutes.
[1:14:58] And yet God tells Hosea the prophet to
[1:15:03] go marry a prostitute.
[1:15:09] Now, o Hosea was not for this
[1:15:13] whatsoever. Now, this was the Old
[1:15:14] Testament types and shadows of the
[1:15:16] redemption that was going to come. God
[1:15:19] was going to show, Amen. He was showing
[1:15:21] us that we come into this world rough,
[1:15:25] buddy. We come into this world, we we we
[1:15:29] Hallelujah. There is no hope for
[1:15:31] us. But God
[1:15:35] came and married us. God chose you in
[1:15:38] your foul state. God chose you in your
[1:15:41] Well, can you say amen? It was it was
[1:15:44] going to it even though it went against
[1:15:46] the nature or the holiness of God, it
[1:15:49] did not go against the nature, amen, of
[1:15:52] redemption with God. How that God would
[1:15:55] come and redeem and c can you say amen.
[1:15:59] Now Goomer would forever more become a
[1:16:01] symbol of Israel's whoredom.
[1:16:04] Amen. And but God was going to show even
[1:16:08] to Israel, I'm going to redeem you back.
[1:16:12] Hallelujah. Now, Hosea's children, Amen.
[1:16:17] He had I believe he had three children
[1:16:19] with him. The first one was Jezel, I
[1:16:22] believe is how you pronounce it. And and
[1:16:23] that mean that name means God's
[1:16:27] souls. Hallelujah. That that Israel had
[1:16:30] received the seed of harlotry, but God
[1:16:33] was going to sew his seed and bring out
[1:16:35] a peculiar people. Well, praise the
[1:16:38] Lord. Amen. There was the the next one
[1:16:42] was lu harama. Amen. Which meant not
[1:16:46] pity. Amen. God's apparent lack of
[1:16:51] compassion. Hallelujah. But it also re
[1:16:53] it also foreshadowed restoration. The
[1:16:56] next one was loami. Amen. Not my people.
[1:17:00] God's rejection of of of them to their
[1:17:03] infidelity, but that God would
[1:17:04] eventually bring Israel back into
[1:17:07] relationship. It was going and and and
[1:17:09] and and we seen that that here here
[1:17:13] Goomer she she stayed with him and then
[1:17:16] she went back out a and become a part of
[1:17:20] a harlot again and and it got so bad.
[1:17:23] Amen. Her sin carried her away until she
[1:17:25] was on an auction block and they were
[1:17:28] selling her as a slave. Amen. This was
[1:17:31] the prophet's wife.
[1:17:34] This was the prophet's wife.
[1:17:37] Hallelujah. And the prophet does it by
[1:17:40] vision. And here he is. And and and he's
[1:17:43] looking. He's sconed. He's he's he's
[1:17:46] scorned. Look down upon.
[1:17:50] And then God appears to him again. And
[1:17:53] God says,
[1:17:54] "Hosea, go to the auction block.
[1:18:00] Go to the auction block and buy Goomer
[1:18:03] your wife.
[1:18:05] buy her back. She's committed her
[1:18:08] whoredom. She's committed her wrongs.
[1:18:10] Amen. After after you in mercy and grace
[1:18:13] married her and took her to yourself and
[1:18:16] she went back. Hallelujah. Saying that
[1:18:18] God though the church has gone and and
[1:18:21] gone and fallen and fallen. That God's
[1:18:25] plan of redemption when God calls you,
[1:18:28] he loves you. Can you say amen?
[1:18:33] He goes and buys her back and pays the
[1:18:35] money for
[1:18:37] her. That was that was an incredible
[1:18:40] thought. Well, praise the Lord. Now, I
[1:18:43] know I I I I know I the Bible's not a a
[1:18:46] dirty book. The message is not a dirty
[1:18:48] book. I'm talking about the genuine seed
[1:18:51] of God that God has placed in in his in
[1:18:56] his elect. Can you say amen? Amen. The
[1:19:00] seed is important.
[1:19:05] Homosexuality, amen, has come and risen
[1:19:07] in this last day because Satan is trying
[1:19:11] to defile seeds.
[1:19:17] Harlotry, living together, shacking
[1:19:22] up, just spilling the seed
[1:19:25] wherever with no commitment at all.
[1:19:28] That's the that's the that's the
[1:19:30] condition of this land
[1:19:36] where a woman can be a sex
[1:19:38] symbol, go lay with multiple partners
[1:19:42] all she wants, but she ain't going to
[1:19:44] come under the headship of one of them.
[1:19:52] Amen.
[1:19:54] Seeds means everything. That's the
[1:19:56] reason why I man fornication and and and
[1:20:01] adultery is is so big in God's books.
[1:20:05] It's a sin that is that is that is that
[1:20:09] that that God just will not overlook.
[1:20:12] Can you say amen?
[1:20:14] Hallelujah. That was the original sin.
[1:20:16] You remember that? It was the original
[1:20:17] sin. Satan show opened their eyes. Satan
[1:20:21] reopened the eyes of her to know. I man
[1:20:26] the
[1:20:27] difference between right and wrong.
[1:20:29] Before she knew nothing but right. She
[1:20:32] knew nothing but good. Eve knew nothing
[1:20:35] but good. She didn't know evil existed.
[1:20:38] Evil did exist because Satan had been
[1:20:40] cast out of heaven. Amen. Evil was
[1:20:42] there. But she was behind the word. All
[1:20:46] she knew was innocency. All she knew was
[1:20:49] purity. But when Satan showed her her
[1:20:52] sexuality, Amen. and the serpent laid
[1:20:55] with her. Then she found out her eyes
[1:20:59] were open. She knew that she had sinned.
[1:21:04] She knew now her eyes were open. But
[1:21:08] praise the Lord. Amen. And they sold fig
[1:21:11] leaves to hide the parts that they
[1:21:13] sinned with.
[1:21:17] True. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:21:21] Did you know that the only grace for her
[1:21:25] was when Adam stepped in? Yes, sir.
[1:21:31] Spoken words original seed. Brother
[1:21:32] Random would say she brought forth death
[1:21:35] through a bastard child which we are all
[1:21:37] a children
[1:21:39] of. But God came in flesh to give us
[1:21:41] another birth to bring us back to the
[1:21:44] original sons and daughters of God.
[1:21:46] There you are. This life sperm in Eve
[1:21:51] never happened. It never did. Can you
[1:21:55] say amen? The exposition of the seven
[1:21:58] church ages. Amen. The church age book.
[1:22:00] Now Eve should have been burned along
[1:22:03] with the serpent for her awful deed. But
[1:22:06] Adam intervened and taking her quickly
[1:22:10] to himself so that she could be saved.
[1:22:16] God could not kill her because Adam's
[1:22:20] seed was within her.
[1:22:25] Hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:22:29] Now, why? Because brother Brandham would
[1:22:32] tell us, Amen. that that when we in that
[1:22:36] union, she becomes part of the man.
[1:22:40] That's in marriage and divorce. She
[1:22:42] becomes part of the man.
[1:22:45] God is saving you and me from the wrath
[1:22:48] that is to come because he has placed
[1:22:50] his genetics, his word seed on the
[1:22:54] inside of you.
[1:23:01] Now, what does this mean?
[1:23:05] Well, man, brother Brandham would say,
[1:23:09] spoken word, the original seed, hybrid
[1:23:11] to Satan's lie. His lovely bride become
[1:23:15] polluted. So is Christ's bride. The
[1:23:17] bride, what made her become polluted?
[1:23:20] Adam's bride. Now, because she never
[1:23:22] stayed with God's word. That's right. I
[1:23:24] ask now, if it's if it's not so, don't
[1:23:27] say it. But if it's so, then say it. The
[1:23:31] reason that God the reason that Adam's
[1:23:33] bride there's three, Adam, Christ, and
[1:23:35] God. There there the reason that Adam's
[1:23:38] bride never did bear right, the
[1:23:40] lifechild is because she disbelieved
[1:23:43] God's word. If that's right, say amen.
[1:23:46] The reason that Jehovah's wife was put
[1:23:48] away or his bride was because she
[1:23:51] rejected God's word, the prophet. That
[1:23:54] right. The reason Christ's bride is put
[1:23:56] away in divorcement is because she has
[1:23:58] rejected the word of God. like Eve did,
[1:24:01] like the rest of them did. Exactly. All
[1:24:04] whoro, all polluted. Their husband could
[1:24:07] not get to them. They were already
[1:24:09] pregnantated for their husband got to
[1:24:10] them.
[1:24:12] Oh, God. Isn't that a pitiful sight?
[1:24:14] Think of young man coming to a woman and
[1:24:16] find her with seed of some other man.
[1:24:19] What thing? What a thing. That's what
[1:24:22] God has done. That's what Adam had done.
[1:24:24] That's what Christ had done. Amen. Signs
[1:24:27] of his coming. Remember, Adam's bride
[1:24:29] was found with false seed. That's
[1:24:30] exactly right. Jehovah's bride was found
[1:24:32] with the same thing. He divorced her,
[1:24:34] put her away. Is that right? That was
[1:24:35] God. And Christ's bride's the same
[1:24:37] thing. She's been found with found with
[1:24:40] worldly organization seed in her and not
[1:24:42] the gospel, having a form of godliness,
[1:24:44] but denying the power thereof from the
[1:24:46] Holy Spirit in the word. There's the
[1:24:48] last sign. There's the sign of the last
[1:24:50] day. And God will divorce her and take a
[1:24:52] bride. As certain as anything in here,
[1:24:54] as it was in the days of Noah, so will
[1:24:56] it be in the coming of the son of man.
[1:24:58] Can you say amen? Amen. So this is a
[1:25:01] very serious thing here. God will not
[1:25:04] put up with
[1:25:06] idolatry. God will not put up that
[1:25:09] idolatry and fornication is the same
[1:25:11] thing. It is taking the words of a man,
[1:25:13] placing them in the seeds of our heart
[1:25:15] and mind.
[1:25:20] Hallelujah. Am I doing all right here
[1:25:23] this morning? Praise the Lord. Taking
[1:25:26] those things and allowing those things
[1:25:31] instead of allowing the word of
[1:25:34] God. Well, you say now, Brother Wind
[1:25:36] now, hi.
[1:25:38] Well, you done mentioned the dress and
[1:25:42] you've mentioned the baptism. I'm
[1:25:44] talking about every other thought that
[1:25:46] we allow to impregnate our hearts.
[1:25:49] I'm talking about every other thought
[1:25:50] and every other attitude and things that
[1:25:52] we
[1:25:56] allow. Gomar was still Gar, but yet
[1:25:59] Gomar was now a prophet's wife.
[1:26:04] Oh, well, praise the
[1:26:06] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:26:09] Did you know that that Israel was all
[1:26:11] upset with Moses for marrying the
[1:26:13] Ethiopian?
[1:26:14] And it seemed Moses, oh, it seemed that
[1:26:17] Moses went against God's command to
[1:26:18] marry. Amen. Because the command was to
[1:26:21] marry within their own race. But here,
[1:26:23] Moses went and married a
[1:26:25] gentile. Went and married a gentile.
[1:26:28] Hallelujah. But God was showing the
[1:26:30] great picture of redemption to where he
[1:26:32] was going to bring a gentile woman in
[1:26:35] and make her Jew. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:26:39] Amen. Now, now in respect, the prophet
[1:26:42] would say, "And there one day we found
[1:26:44] out that even Miam a prophetist and
[1:26:46] Aaron the high priest made fun of Moses'
[1:26:47] wife and because she was an Ethiopian
[1:26:49] and thought, wasn't wasn't there enough
[1:26:52] women of our own group to marry?" And
[1:26:54] instead of going down there and marrying
[1:26:56] that woman, that wasn't Moses' choice.
[1:26:58] That was God's choice. He was in Moses.
[1:27:02] He He sure was. He was in Moses and was
[1:27:06] an alien in his own country and took a
[1:27:08] gentile wife. And then brother Brandham
[1:27:11] says,
[1:27:12] "Hallelujah." How that God was going,
[1:27:15] "What changed? What Brother Brandham
[1:27:17] would go on and say, now what changed?
[1:27:19] What what separated her from being a
[1:27:21] Gentile and now she's a Jew?" It was the
[1:27:24] seed of Moses in her that made her who
[1:27:27] she was. Look at Rahab the harlot. Amen.
[1:27:30] She was a harlot. She was born, Amen. of
[1:27:33] a family of harlots here. And and and
[1:27:35] and the Bible says that the when the two
[1:27:38] spies went, God sent them right into
[1:27:40] Rahab's house and she lodged there at
[1:27:44] the harlots. They lodged at the harlot's
[1:27:46] house.
[1:27:50] Well, praise the
[1:27:51] Lord. Amen.
[1:27:55] And because of her goodness to them.
[1:27:58] Now, now keep this in my mind or in your
[1:28:02] mind. God kept them. Show. Now there she
[1:28:06] promised. Hey, I want as I've been good
[1:28:09] to you, give me a
[1:28:11] token. Give me a token that when you
[1:28:15] come, everything's going to be okay. And
[1:28:18] God says, and they said, you you just
[1:28:20] Amen. This rope that you drop us down
[1:28:22] with, Amen. put that outside the window
[1:28:25] and when we come we will see that token
[1:28:27] and everyone that's inside every he they
[1:28:30] he said bring in your mama your daddy
[1:28:32] your your aunts your uncles bring
[1:28:34] everyone in bring them under that token
[1:28:37] for they shall all be spared
[1:28:41] can you say amen they shall all be
[1:28:44] spared and when they came to the city
[1:28:47] and the sanctification process that was
[1:28:50] justification sanctification that she
[1:28:52] was saved through it Oh, but she was
[1:28:54] still a gentile harlot, folks.
[1:28:58] She was still a gentile harlot. Oh, can
[1:29:02] you say amen? Without the You can be
[1:29:05] justified. You can be sanctified, but
[1:29:07] until the seed of regeneration is within
[1:29:10] you, there you are still a gentile
[1:29:12] harlot.
[1:29:14] Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:29:19] Does anyone know the
[1:29:21] lineage of
[1:29:23] Rahab? Does anyone
[1:29:26] know
[1:29:28] what? Well, praise the
[1:29:31] Lord. Okay. Rahab, I'm not going to hold
[1:29:33] you long and I and I I hope I'm not too
[1:29:36] boring here this morning, but I'm trying
[1:29:37] to get to a
[1:29:38] point. Rahab married a man by the name
[1:29:42] of Salmon.
[1:29:44] Amen. Salmon was from the tribe of
[1:29:49] Levi. Now he was from the tribe of Levi.
[1:29:52] And of course we understand that Jesus
[1:29:53] was to come from the tribe of Levi. Gw.
[1:29:57] And here Salmon married this
[1:30:01] woman. Hallelujah. How many knows where
[1:30:05] Boaz,
[1:30:07] the great kinsman redeemer, came from?
[1:30:12] He came from the union of Salmon and
[1:30:17] Rahab that used to be a gentile harlot
[1:30:21] who was now a Jew
[1:30:25] through
[1:30:28] marriage. Now Raab the harlot will
[1:30:32] forever more be in the lineage of Jesus.
[1:30:40] Can you say amen? I I I I uh where's
[1:30:45] where do they talk about the lineage? Is
[1:30:46] that is that in Is that in in
[1:30:50] Matthew? Uh is that Matthew
[1:30:54] 1 or Matthew
[1:30:57] 2. Praise the
[1:31:02] Lord. We sure don't want to be be boring
[1:31:05] to you here this morning.
[1:31:08] and um Genesis 1 or or Matthew 1 and 1,
[1:31:12] the book of the generation of Jesus
[1:31:14] Christ, the son of David, the son of
[1:31:17] Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac. Isaac
[1:31:20] begat Jacob. Jacob begat Judah and his
[1:31:22] brethren. Judah begat Forz and and Zara
[1:31:26] of
[1:31:29] Famar. Forz begat Esim. Ezram begat
[1:31:34] Aram. And Aram begat Aminadab. And
[1:31:37] Aminadab begget N. And N begget Salmon.
[1:31:41] Salmon begget Boaz of Rahab. Boaz begget
[1:31:46] Obed of Ruth. Obed begget Jesse. Jesse
[1:31:50] begget
[1:31:52] David the king.
[1:31:55] Well, praise the Lord. Now, and David
[1:31:59] was
[1:32:00] promised the throne forever. Now, if
[1:32:02] you'd go on down there, you you'd find
[1:32:04] to go right on to Jesus.
[1:32:08] God didn't just change her from being a
[1:32:10] harlot. God gave her a new
[1:32:14] position. She could no
[1:32:17] longer She still had the family roots.
[1:32:20] She still had her family history. She
[1:32:23] still had her She still could go back to
[1:32:26] what she used to be down memories lane
[1:32:29] with her affections, her memory, her
[1:32:32] imagination. She could still go back
[1:32:34] down through all of those things. And
[1:32:36] there were plenty there were plenty of
[1:32:38] imaginations could tell her, "You're
[1:32:40] really not a real Jew. You're really not
[1:32:43] a real you're really not a you don't
[1:32:45] even belong in here."
[1:32:48] But she belonged in there through
[1:32:52] marriage.
[1:32:55] The seed in her womb changed everything.
[1:33:04] When God says, "I am not going to call
[1:33:07] you church
[1:33:09] anymore, but I'm going to call you
[1:33:12] bride." It was God declaring it's
[1:33:16] another possession.
[1:33:19] You're not in that harlot system
[1:33:21] anymore. You're not in the old ways
[1:33:24] anymore. Your past no longer matters.
[1:33:27] It's the word of God that has changed
[1:33:30] you and made you who you are. That's
[1:33:32] right.
[1:33:34] in this outer man that's connected to
[1:33:37] the spirit. It'll always go back and
[1:33:41] point to your flesh. Your mind will
[1:33:43] always point to your flesh. Your mind
[1:33:45] will never point to your new birth. Your
[1:33:47] mind will always point to your
[1:33:49] insufficiencies. Your mind will always
[1:33:51] point to everything else. But it's the
[1:33:53] new birth. It's where the seed of God by
[1:33:55] the word of God has taken root into your
[1:33:57] heart. There's where the change has
[1:33:59] taken place.
[1:34:01] That's right. And it's up to
[1:34:05] you to stand there and say, "I am not
[1:34:08] that man. I am not that woman. I am not
[1:34:12] I I refuse those thoughts. I refuse
[1:34:16] those attitudes. I refuse those because
[1:34:20] I have been brought in." Oh, God
[1:34:23] almighty. Brought into the economy of
[1:34:26] God.
[1:34:30] Can you say amen?
[1:34:32] Oh. Oh. Hallelujah. Oh my. Your past has
[1:34:36] nothing to do with it. God will take God
[1:34:39] will take God's made us all virtuous.
[1:34:43] Well, praise the Lord. It doesn't matter
[1:34:45] what what your past has been. It don't
[1:34:47] matter whether you were physically if
[1:34:48] you were Amen. If you
[1:34:51] had many many partners or doesn't matter
[1:34:55] whether you're just you were just as
[1:34:56] pure as a lily in the natural. It it
[1:34:59] that those things doesn't matter. Amen.
[1:35:01] We were all born in in in this vile
[1:35:04] condition. The reason you have the
[1:35:07] problems with your mind and your body
[1:35:09] right now is because of what Eve had
[1:35:12] done. There would never have been a
[1:35:14] thought of sin. There would never have
[1:35:17] been a thought of regret. There would
[1:35:19] never have been any of those things.
[1:35:22] Amen. There they were not there. She was
[1:35:24] innocent. Are y'all hearing me? Amen.
[1:35:27] But you're still living in a vile body.
[1:35:30] Amen. And that mind will tell you all
[1:35:32] kinds of things. It'll it'll use the
[1:35:34] good from the evil. It'll use the good
[1:35:37] to to hurt you. And it it it just it
[1:35:39] just does it complexes as is everywhere.
[1:35:42] But I want to say it's the word of God
[1:35:44] that separates. It's the word of God
[1:35:47] that divides. It's the word of God that
[1:35:49] says, "Amen. I'm going to separate your
[1:35:52] mind from the reality of the word." It's
[1:35:55] the word that has separated you to
[1:35:58] himself.
[1:36:02] It's the word that's done it. That's why
[1:36:04] we don't listen to man's opinion. It's
[1:36:07] why we don't listen to Amen. the things
[1:36:10] uh uh uh that that wants to lure us.
[1:36:12] It's the word we're separated to. Oh
[1:36:16] church of the living God, be separated
[1:36:18] to the word. Don't you flirt with the
[1:36:20] word. Don't you flirt with sin. Don't
[1:36:22] you flirt with the things. Stay right
[1:36:25] with that word.
[1:36:32] Because it's that word.
[1:36:35] Well, Brother Wendell, I I'm I'm I
[1:36:40] deserve to carry that grudge
[1:36:42] because you've got to be impregnated
[1:36:44] with the word. The word separates
[1:36:47] you. You You have no right to hold those
[1:36:50] grudges. You have no right. No right at
[1:36:54] all. I don't care how much your
[1:36:55] imagination tells you. I don't care how
[1:36:57] much you've got your reasoning all put
[1:36:59] together. You have zero rights
[1:37:05] because the word has come and separated
[1:37:09] you to himself.
[1:37:12] Can you say amen?
[1:37:14] Do do you understand? Now we stand in
[1:37:19] faith. Now we stand in purity. Now
[1:37:24] again,
[1:37:26] Iman again in the presence of God.
[1:37:29] Remember, you got the you got the three
[1:37:31] rooms. You've got the outer courts.
[1:37:33] Amen. Hallelujah. That that that's the
[1:37:35] kitchen. Then you got the then you got
[1:37:37] the living room. That's the most holy
[1:37:39] place. Amen. You've got the you got the
[1:37:42] three different lights. As as we talked,
[1:37:44] we're not going to go back over
[1:37:44] Wednesday night. Amen. But it's that
[1:37:47] inner veil that in where you drop that
[1:37:50] veil behind you. Amen. It it's there in
[1:37:54] that most holy place is where the glory
[1:37:58] of God is revealed. Now remember the
[1:38:01] prophet told us the justification
[1:38:03] through the blood of the lamb. That that
[1:38:05] represented God. That's the life of God.
[1:38:07] Jesus died for us. The the the the most
[1:38:10] or the holy place. Amen. the golden
[1:38:12] candlesticks, the olive oil that
[1:38:13] represented the Holy Spirit. He said the
[1:38:15] gifts and things were there that that
[1:38:17] was all part of it, but it was only
[1:38:20] inside that third compartment where the
[1:38:22] shikina glory could take place. He says
[1:38:25] that's where the rod budded. That's
[1:38:27] where, Amen. the glory fell. That's
[1:38:30] where God made all things possible. God
[1:38:34] let me live in that inner court. Amen.
[1:38:40] Can you say amen?
[1:38:42] Amen. He said now after you left the
[1:38:45] inner the second court sanctification,
[1:38:47] they entered into that consecrated life,
[1:38:49] entered into the presence of God. And
[1:38:51] while they were in there, there is where
[1:38:53] they had these glorious things. Here is
[1:38:55] the very beautiful type that in there
[1:38:57] anything dead lived. Anything dead that
[1:39:00] come in lived again. Did you ever think
[1:39:02] of it? They took Aaron's rod and had
[1:39:04] Aaron's rod in the presence of this holy
[1:39:06] place. And when they did one night, one
[1:39:08] night's time, it budded, blossomed, and
[1:39:10] yielded almonds. In one night's time,
[1:39:13] think of it, in the presence of God, the
[1:39:15] old dead rod laying there in the
[1:39:16] presence of God budded, blossomed, and
[1:39:19] yielded autumns.
[1:39:21] In one night, what was it then? What
[1:39:24] kind of rod was it? It was an almond
[1:39:26] tree rod. That's where it had been taken
[1:39:29] from. The stick was off an almond tree.
[1:39:31] Come on brother and sister. Hallelujah.
[1:39:34] You've been taken off of Elohim. You
[1:39:36] came from God and you're going back to
[1:39:38] God in the presence. He says and you are
[1:39:42] a stick sometime you you was taken off
[1:39:44] the branch of humanity which was God's
[1:39:46] creative son in the beginning but you
[1:39:49] may have fallen and dead and alienated
[1:39:51] from God but by that in creation you
[1:39:52] were created to be a son of God. You may
[1:39:55] bounce around and be respected and
[1:39:56] honored here in the courts. Amen. But if
[1:39:58] you ever get into that glorious place
[1:40:00] and hid away with God, you will yield
[1:40:03] what you're supposed to take a dead
[1:40:06] sinner alienated from God without hope
[1:40:08] without Christ. Put him in the presence
[1:40:10] of God in this glorious tabernacle in
[1:40:12] there. He will yield the fruit of the
[1:40:14] Holy Spirit, love, joy, peace,
[1:40:16] longsuffering. The dead rod budded. For
[1:40:19] it budded, Amen. It had to have
[1:40:21] refreshment. Had to be refreshed. After
[1:40:24] it was refreshed, well, it brought forth
[1:40:27] an odor of perfume and blossom and the
[1:40:29] next thing was the fruit. Can you say
[1:40:32] amen?
[1:40:33] You love him. Oh, glory to God. Now,
[1:40:37] these outer courts are wonderful. We
[1:40:40] come to church, but we also we also
[1:40:43] share light with other people. In body,
[1:40:46] we're here. Some of you may be in body,
[1:40:48] but in your spirit, you're somewhere
[1:40:50] else. Hallelujah. Amen. That's right.
[1:40:53] Amen. But but here here you can be in
[1:40:57] body. Amen. But your body's also going
[1:41:00] to go outside the doors there. You're
[1:41:01] going to see and you're also going to be
[1:41:03] going to eat and you're also right.
[1:41:05] Amen. So you're a Christian among you're
[1:41:09] among everyone else. Amen. The
[1:41:11] sunshine. You see the same sunshine. You
[1:41:13] you're affected by the same rain. Amen,
[1:41:15] brother Merl. Hallelujah. We found that
[1:41:17] our both of our ditches were affected by
[1:41:19] the same rain. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh yes.
[1:41:22] Hallelujah. Just oh my just just just
[1:41:25] just it's just crazy. You're affected by
[1:41:27] those things and in the spirit and and
[1:41:29] then in the church. Amen. There's church
[1:41:31] members. Amen. Everyone goes to church.
[1:41:34] Everyone but again there there if
[1:41:37] there's not a passion for the
[1:41:39] word it doesn't do much. But see there's
[1:41:42] going to be somebody that lives that has
[1:41:44] all three channels. Your body, your
[1:41:46] spirit, and your soul. And that inner
[1:41:49] channel, that inner channel has cleared
[1:41:51] everything else. Amen. So, you're still
[1:41:54] going to work with everybody, but you
[1:41:56] are separated unto the Lord. You're
[1:41:59] still providing for your family, but
[1:42:00] you're separated to the Lord.
[1:42:03] Well, can you say amen? They're all
[1:42:06] smoking their cigarettes, but you you
[1:42:07] can't. Why? Because your passion is to
[1:42:10] the Lord. Others are telling smutty
[1:42:12] jokes, but you can't. Why? Because your
[1:42:15] heart is just separated. God's done
[1:42:17] something within you. You're separated
[1:42:21] unto the Lord.
[1:42:24] Oh, glory to God. Don't you just love
[1:42:26] him?
[1:42:27] Amen. You see, that's that's where the
[1:42:31] glory now inside. How do we know? And
[1:42:34] and not going to hold you too much
[1:42:35] longer now. H how how what what what
[1:42:38] takes place on the inside? There is a
[1:42:41] knowing. There's that something on the
[1:42:44] inside. Your mind can't tell you. Your
[1:42:46] spirit can't tell you, your body might
[1:42:48] tell you different, your eyes might tell
[1:42:50] you different, but yet there is a
[1:42:52] knowing on the inside like Abraham. I am
[1:42:55] going to have that baby. 25 years as an
[1:42:59] old man and never able to have that
[1:43:01] baby. But God gave him the promise.
[1:43:05] His body, his mind, his his his eyes,
[1:43:08] his feelings. Come on.
[1:43:11] Come on now. He was in his 80s and still
[1:43:15] claiming he was going to have that baby.
[1:43:20] But there was an inner knowing.
[1:43:23] Got me? Still lived to death. Still had
[1:43:27] this. Even reason with God occasionally.
[1:43:30] I don't see how this can happen. Can can
[1:43:32] it come through Eleaser?
[1:43:37] But when all the thoughts were done,
[1:43:39] when all of the emotions were set aside,
[1:43:41] there was an absolute knowing God gave
[1:43:44] me a promise.
[1:43:48] And your mind and your your thoughts and
[1:43:50] your eyes and your ears and your
[1:43:53] feelings might tell you every which
[1:43:55] direction. Amen. Might tell you, well,
[1:43:59] hallelujah. Well, you're going to you're
[1:44:01] just going to fall again. Well, you were
[1:44:03] a drunk before, you'll be a drunk again.
[1:44:05] Well, you were a druggie before. You're
[1:44:06] going to be there. Listen, one. No, sir.
[1:44:09] When God places that seed on the inside
[1:44:11] of you, I don't care what your mind
[1:44:13] tells you. I don't care what your
[1:44:14] emotions tell you. You're anchored with
[1:44:17] Christ. You're separated unto him. There
[1:44:20] is a passion for his word on the inside
[1:44:23] of you. You are not Rahab the harlot.
[1:44:26] You are the virgin born bride of Jesus
[1:44:29] Christ.
[1:44:32] Yes.
[1:44:34] Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:44:38] Amen. When he talked about that knowing,
[1:44:41] that inner knowing, he says, "Ah, now we
[1:44:44] would
[1:44:45] think if such anointing was on him, had
[1:44:48] been prophesied 800 years before that
[1:44:50] talking about Christ. Here he was with
[1:44:52] that type of anointing, the full
[1:44:54] blessing and anointing of the Lord upon
[1:44:56] him, he would run all over the building
[1:44:57] and scream and holler." He says, "But
[1:45:00] the Bible says he laid down the scroll,
[1:45:03] sat down, and precious words proceeded
[1:45:05] from his mouth." That's what he done
[1:45:08] under the anointing. The anointing is
[1:45:10] not emotion. The anointing is supreme
[1:45:13] power in
[1:45:14] control, knowing exactly what and how.
[1:45:21] Oh, can you say amen? Oh, you're now now
[1:45:24] you say, "Well, Brother Wendle, I I my
[1:45:28] emotions are going. just just keep on
[1:45:29] going. It's time for you to go back
[1:45:30] there in the in the back room. It's time
[1:45:32] for you to go back there with God in
[1:45:34] that place of rest, that place of
[1:45:36] safety, that place between you and God
[1:45:40] and let him talk to you a
[1:45:42] while. Then all of the fear, all of the
[1:45:46] emotions, all of those complexes will
[1:45:49] all have to just settle back down
[1:45:52] because God has spoke. Amen.
[1:45:55] Can you say amen?
[1:46:01] Amen. This is coming out of the wire
[1:46:04] people talked about. He says another
[1:46:06] great thing of entering into this place
[1:46:08] is where you can have
[1:46:10] confidence. You can you can have
[1:46:13] confidence. I know in whom I have
[1:46:15] believed. Is that right? Amen. And he
[1:46:18] uses a woman. He said, "Here's a woman
[1:46:20] laying here stretched on a stretcher
[1:46:22] this morning in a serious condition. And
[1:46:24] if she doesn't touch, now again, here
[1:46:26] she is in her body. Here she is in her
[1:46:28] body. Amen. God doesn't touch her,
[1:46:31] she'll die. She's aged. She's an old
[1:46:33] mother, gray hair, wearing glasses, very
[1:46:35] godly looking woman. I shook her hand
[1:46:37] and talked to her a few a few words few
[1:46:41] moments ago when I come in and and now
[1:46:43] she's laying here there here. Perhaps
[1:46:46] her doctor has come with all he knows
[1:46:47] how to do, but he can do no more. She
[1:46:50] has fallen her ankle and ribs and so
[1:46:52] forth and complications she's told me
[1:46:54] which was what was wrong with her and
[1:46:56] things that she didn't know also but but
[1:46:58] there she lays in that kind of a state
[1:47:01] well being in that kind of a condition
[1:47:02] and tore up like that now what can we do
[1:47:05] for her is to bring her into this
[1:47:08] blessed presence of the allsufficient
[1:47:11] refreshing Holy Ghost that can take the
[1:47:13] stailness away from her as the doctor
[1:47:15] though as good as he could be trying to
[1:47:18] tell her maybe that there's nothing more
[1:47:19] I can do. But we lift her into this
[1:47:23] place. Well, you're old and your days
[1:47:26] are all spent out about spent. That
[1:47:29] didn't mean one thing to Abraham. When
[1:47:31] he come to the presence of God, a
[1:47:32] hundred years old, he pleased God and
[1:47:34] considered not his own body now dead.
[1:47:37] But he was in the presence of Jehovah
[1:47:38] who had promised him. Here sits a lady
[1:47:40] on the on the end of the seat dying with
[1:47:42] cancer. Sure, sure to die. Nothing else
[1:47:44] but to die. But if we could only get
[1:47:47] her. Oh, someone shout hallelujah.
[1:47:50] Nobody, he says, nobody led Aaron in.
[1:47:53] Aaron walked in because he was invited
[1:47:56] in because it was told to him by
[1:47:59] Jehovah. He had the right to go in
[1:48:02] behind that veil. Friend, are you
[1:48:05] hearing me? No one had to come and lead
[1:48:07] him in. God gave him that. And God's
[1:48:10] inviting you into that room. God's
[1:48:12] inviting you into that most holy place.
[1:48:15] That's that sacred place. That's that
[1:48:18] that's that intimate place. That's that
[1:48:20] place where
[1:48:21] God man does his thing. That's where his
[1:48:26] word comes to life. That's where his
[1:48:29] word becomes flesh. That's where God and
[1:48:35] man become
[1:48:37] real. Can you say amen?
[1:48:40] Well, do you love him? Let me go. I want
[1:48:44] to go into those courts. Take me into
[1:48:47] the holy of
[1:48:49] holy. Take me in by the
[1:48:52] blood of the
[1:48:55] lamb. Take me in to the
[1:48:59] holy of
[1:49:02] holy
[1:49:05] days my lips. Here I
[1:49:11] am in in
[1:49:14] in a core. Help me
[1:49:19] out. Holy place made
[1:49:23] clean.
[1:49:24] Holy of
[1:49:27] holies is the Holy
[1:49:31] Ghost. The mighty presence of
[1:49:36] Jehovah. and I his prisoner of
[1:49:40] love. Lord, help me so you can rise in
[1:49:45] me. The
[1:49:47] capstone of
[1:49:49] love take
[1:49:54] me. I I I I want your word to have
[1:49:57] preeminence even in the little
[1:49:59] things. The little
[1:50:01] things. I want to go into the holy
[1:50:03] place.
[1:50:05] I want to go into that precious
[1:50:08] place. I know I've got to come through
[1:50:10] the altar of sanctification first. And
[1:50:12] that means I've got to be scrubbed with
[1:50:14] the washing of the water of the word,
[1:50:17] but I got to scrub. I got to I got some
[1:50:20] part of Wendle Martin in here that still
[1:50:21] needs a lot of scrubbing. I got to die
[1:50:23] out to
[1:50:24] myself. Is there anyone else in the
[1:50:27] building that can say that? I I I got
[1:50:28] some dying I need to
[1:50:31] do. I want to go back in that room. I I
[1:50:34] I want I want the presence of
[1:50:37] God. I've got the Holy Ghost. But
[1:50:39] Brother Wendle, I' I've I've not been
[1:50:42] back into that place of intimacy in a
[1:50:44] long time because I've allowed junk.
[1:50:48] I've allowed
[1:50:49] junk. I've allowed junk in my life.
[1:50:54] I've got things that I
[1:50:58] know that my soul
[1:51:03] knows. And that soul is going to divide
[1:51:06] those inner
[1:51:07] courts from the outer
[1:51:11] courts. I want your Holy Spirit though.
[1:51:15] come upon me, mold me, made
[1:51:21] me, purify
[1:51:24] me. All of that junk, all of that
[1:51:27] nonsense that I
[1:51:29] [Music]
[1:51:30] allow, I want to go there that place of
[1:51:33] refreshment. I want to I want
[1:51:36] rest. Come on
[1:51:40] now. I don't want that. I I don't want
[1:51:42] to be illuminated. I don't want my
[1:51:44] spiritual walk to be
[1:51:46] smoky. I don't want my light to go in
[1:51:49] and out and having to replace the oil
[1:51:51] again and having to let me go into those
[1:51:54] that most holy place. Let let me come
[1:51:57] where the shakina glories that where
[1:51:59] where the veil has been rent. I can't it
[1:52:01] is separating me from everything else.
[1:52:03] It's just me and God and his
[1:52:07] word. There's where life comes.
[1:52:12] There's where the Holy Spirit Oh, can
[1:52:16] you say amen for the window? I'm all
[1:52:18] torn this
[1:52:19] morning. It's so easy to I I I I I I get
[1:52:24] I get torn. I see this one doing that
[1:52:26] and and it gets me and I see that one
[1:52:28] there and I hear this doctrine and I
[1:52:30] hear that I Oh, I just you you just got
[1:52:34] to keep on coming. Come out of Come out
[1:52:35] of those come Come out of the rain. Come
[1:52:38] come come out of that smoky Amen. second
[1:52:41] part of the tabernacle. Come on into the
[1:52:42] shikina presence of the Lord where it's
[1:52:44] just you and
[1:52:46] God. It's soundproof. It's soundproof.
[1:52:49] You can't hear nothing. You don't you
[1:52:50] don't hear nothing outside. You don't
[1:52:52] you It has totally separated you from
[1:52:55] your spirit and body. It's you and God.
[1:52:57] It is you and God. Hallelujah. Let it
[1:53:01] rain. Let the ice come. Let let let
[1:53:04] whatever happens, it's just me and God.
[1:53:06] Let tornadoes come and go. I I it's even
[1:53:10] tornado proof. It's me and
[1:53:14] God. I want that intimacy. I want his
[1:53:16] word. I want his word
[1:53:20] to be rich in my fertile
[1:53:23] soil. I want the glory of the Lord. Oh,
[1:53:26] come on, church. Do do you long for that
[1:53:29] more than anything else? Do do you long
[1:53:32] for that to where you can be gossip
[1:53:34] proof? Do do you long for that?
[1:53:39] to where you can be hurt feeling proof.
[1:53:42] Yes. Can you long for that? To where you
[1:53:46] can be malice
[1:53:48] proof, hatred
[1:53:51] proof. Oh, there's a place. There's a
[1:53:55] place.
[1:53:57] Hallelujah. Oh, go commune with God.
[1:53:59] Don't you go out there
[1:54:02] and commit idolatry and whoredoms and
[1:54:05] and and and and heeding to this and
[1:54:08] allow these seeds that are mine. No,
[1:54:09] there will be no seeds of any sort but
[1:54:12] God's word and I'm going to separate
[1:54:15] myself to
[1:54:16] him. I'm going to separate myself to
[1:54:20] him. Oh, I am his. I'm created for
[1:54:24] him. Hallelujah. Now, I spoke pretty
[1:54:27] direct here this morning.
[1:54:30] But I I I I'm all through the Bible.
[1:54:32] It's laced all through the scripture
[1:54:34] from the very beginning in the verse
[1:54:35] very first sin all the way all the way
[1:54:38] down to the very end where the bride
[1:54:39] where there is a pure bride. There is a
[1:54:41] pure groom and there is a beautiful
[1:54:45] place of Eden. There will be no more
[1:54:46] sin, no more sorrow, no more devil, no
[1:54:48] tomorrow. Amen. The old things will be
[1:54:51] passed away. Your bodies will be
[1:54:53] changed. this old this old hybrid
[1:54:55] condition, this old hybrid spirit, this
[1:54:57] old hybrid body that that you you're
[1:54:59] you're hybrid here. Amen. You come,
[1:55:01] you've got the complexes of your daddy
[1:55:03] and your mama and your grandpa and your
[1:55:05] grandma and your great great great. You
[1:55:06] are here because of the complexes of
[1:55:09] your past. But I am here to tell you,
[1:55:12] God has separated that soul from your
[1:55:15] spirit and body. If you'll just heed to
[1:55:17] him here this morning and let his spirit
[1:55:20] come in you and renew you. Renew me.
[1:55:26] Renew
[1:55:27] me. Renew
[1:55:29] me.
[1:55:31] Hallelujah.
[1:55:33] Rest. Rest that comes from him and him
[1:55:38] alone of the lamb.
[1:55:43] Take me out to the
[1:55:47] holy of
[1:55:51] holy. Take the
[1:55:53] coast.
[1:55:55] Here I
[1:55:59] am. Take me
[1:56:01] into the holy.
[1:56:07] Oh,
[1:56:10] by the
[1:56:13] blood. Hallelujah.
[1:56:18] To the
[1:56:20] holy of holy of
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:28] holy the unveiling of God. This is the
[1:56:31] old temple in the veil. What was back
[1:56:33] behind there? What was Jehovah? What was
[1:56:36] hid back there? What was the veil
[1:56:38] hiding? Oh, hallelujah. What was the
[1:56:40] veil hiding? It was hiding the word. The
[1:56:42] veil, the old badger skins, was hiding
[1:56:44] the word to the natural
[1:56:47] eyes. Behind there also was the shoe
[1:56:50] bread. Behind there was the shikina
[1:56:51] glory, but it was all hid from them. It
[1:56:54] was all hid. All the glory of God was
[1:56:57] right behind that old badger skin.
[1:56:59] Right. That's right. All hid to the
[1:57:01] natural eye.
[1:57:03] It is today too. All a bunch of holy
[1:57:05] rollers fanatics. They don't see what's
[1:57:08] hid behind them. That's what they don't
[1:57:11] know. Then when God and mercy rent that
[1:57:13] veil for them to see, they were so
[1:57:15] wrapped up in their traditions, they
[1:57:17] still it was still hid to them even to
[1:57:19] this day. It's the same now. The glory,
[1:57:22] the power of the Holy Spirit, the
[1:57:24] shikina glory that comes upon the
[1:57:26] believer now. I mean, the real believer
[1:57:28] that causes the works of God and the
[1:57:30] faith to come into him to believe the
[1:57:33] word of God. That's all hid to to them
[1:57:36] eyes. Then things are all passed behind
[1:57:39] the
[1:57:41] veil. You're not behind the veil
[1:57:43] anymore, little ones. You've come in.
[1:57:45] God has come into full view of
[1:57:48] you. God has come into full view of you.
[1:57:51] Someone say, "God has come into full
[1:57:53] view."
[1:57:55] God has come into my full view. God has
[1:57:58] come into my view. I believe God. I'm
[1:58:01] going to have to walk with God. His
[1:58:02] word. I know what his word is. I know
[1:58:05] where I'm standing. I know who I am.
[1:58:08] It's a
[1:58:09] changing. I'm not a servant. I'm his
[1:58:12] bride. It's a changing of the position.
[1:58:16] I'm standing here in faith and I love
[1:58:18] him with all of my heart.
[1:58:22] Cleanse my lips. Here I
[1:58:29] am to the
[1:58:31] holy of
[1:58:35] holies. Take me in by the
[1:58:39] blood of the lamb.
[1:58:43] Oh, take me
[1:58:45] into the glory. Oh, holy holy.
[1:58:52] Take
[1:58:53] the cleanse my
[1:58:55] lips. Here I
[1:58:59] am. In the outer courts. I'm
[1:59:03] justified. In the holy place made clean.
[1:59:08] But in the holy of
[1:59:12] holy is the holy ghost
[1:59:16] himself, the mighty presence of
[1:59:20] Jehovah and I, his prisoner of
[1:59:24] love. Lord, help me so you can rise in
[1:59:28] me. The
[1:59:30] capstone of
[1:59:32] love, take me in.
[1:59:36] Hallelujah.
[1:59:37] [Music]

[2:00:01] lips. Here I am.
[2:00:05] Oh, take me in to the holy, the
[2:00:13] holy. Take me in by the blood of the
[2:00:21] lamb. Take me in to the
[2:00:26] holy of
[2:00:29] holies. Take the cleanse my lips. Here I
[2:00:36] am in the outer
[2:00:38] courts. In the outer courts I'm
[2:00:42] justified. In the holy place make
[2:00:46] clean. But in the holy of
[2:00:50] holies is the holy
[2:00:55] ghost body presence of
[2:01:00] Jehovah. Thank you Lord.
[2:01:09] Capstone of love. Take me in to the

[2:01:40] lips. Here I
[2:01:43] am. Take the cleanse my
[2:01:48] lips. Here I
[2:01:54] [Music]

[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:21] Hide thou

[2:05:37] [Music]
[2:05:38] Lays your seal
[2:05:42] upon my heart's
[2:05:45] door that I may not
[2:05:49] sin against thee, oh
[2:05:53] Lord. Oh, hide thou
[2:05:57] me in thy secret place.
[2:06:03] There may I
[2:06:05] find your mercy and
[2:06:10] grace. Place your seal
[2:06:14] upon my heart's
[2:06:18] door that I may not

[2:06:50] Lord that I may not
[2:06:53] sin against thee. Oh
[2:06:59] Lord, praise the
[2:07:01] Lord. That song is so powerful. I don't
[2:07:05] want nothing in my heart. I don't want
[2:07:06] to even dwell on that that stuff. And if
[2:07:09] you've allowed things in your heart,
[2:07:11] it's developing into bitterness and it's
[2:07:13] into junk. And you know, you know it's
[2:07:16] not accurate. You know it's not
[2:07:19] true. If you've got the Holy Ghost, you
[2:07:22] do because the soul separates. It
[2:07:26] separates what your mind is telling you
[2:07:28] and what your eyes are telling you and
[2:07:29] what those things are telling you. You
[2:07:31] know it's not accurate. Not accurate.
[2:07:34] Satan might come in and and and build it
[2:07:37] one way or
[2:07:38] another. No. Stand right there with the
[2:07:41] word of God. Can you say amen? Stand
[2:07:45] true. Stand powerful, bride. Stand
[2:07:49] powerful. Love him. Live with him. Amen.
[2:07:54] Praise the Lord. I'm so thankful for
[2:07:56] that rest in
[2:07:59] him. Praise the Lord.

[2:10:00] world. Brother Joe
[2:10:03] backslider and how God's grace came
