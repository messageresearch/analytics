[40:18] amen all right if you have your Bibles
[40:20] let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter
[40:25] 10 and we'll be starting at verse
[40:45] one 1 Corinthians chapter 10 starting at
[40:49] verse
[40:50] one moreover Brethren I would not that
[40:53] you should be ignorant how that all our
[40:55] fathers were under the cloud
[40:57] and all passed through the sea and were
[41:00] all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and
[41:03] in the sea and did all eat the same
[41:05] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[41:07] same spiritual drink for they drank of
[41:10] that spiritual rock that followed them
[41:12] and that rock was Christ but with many
[41:14] of them God was not well pleased for
[41:16] they were overthrown in the wilderness
[41:19] now these things were our examples to
[41:21] the intent that we should not lust after
[41:23] evil things as they also lusted neither
[41:25] be idolators as were some of them as it
[41:28] is written the the people sat down to
[41:30] eat and drink and Rose up to play
[41:32] neither let us commit fornications as
[41:34] some of them committed and fell in one
[41:36] day three and
[41:37] 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as
[41:40] some of them also tempted and were
[41:41] destroyed of
[41:42] serpents neither murmur ye as some of
[41:44] them also murmured and were destroyed of
[41:48] the
[41:48] Destroyer now all these things happened
[41:51] unto them for examples and they are
[41:53] written for our admonition upon whom the
[41:56] ends of of the world are
[41:58] come you may all have your
[42:11] seats now the Israelites and a lot of
[42:14] this as
[42:15] I'm kind of setting my Foundation of
[42:18] where we're going a lot of this is going
[42:20] to be super familiar and um just kind of
[42:25] pardon me as we go through things that
[42:28] we've heard preached so many times but
[42:30] the Israelites were slaves in Egypt for
[42:33] around 400 years and
[42:36] they only came out after God had
[42:40] Afflicted Egypt with the plagues and
[42:45] completely destroyed most of Egypt and
[42:49] finally Moses was able to leave the
[42:51] Mount of the land and after they crossed
[42:55] the Red Sea and had gone to Mount Si
[42:59] then Moses sent out the TW spies to to
[43:01] spy out the promised land and the 12 men
[43:05] returned bearing the fruits of the land
[43:08] but 10 of the men said that they
[43:10] couldn't conquer because there were
[43:13] giants in the land and there were
[43:16] fortified cities and it was just too
[43:18] much for them to be able to take
[43:20] on only Joshua and Caleb believed the
[43:23] promise that had been
[43:26] given in numbers chap 14 and verse
[43:31] 22 it says because all those men which
[43:33] have seen my glory and my Miracles which
[43:35] I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and
[43:38] have tempted me now these 10 times and
[43:40] have not hearkened to my voice surely
[43:42] they shall not see the land which I
[43:44] swear unto their fathers neither shall
[43:47] any of them that provoked me see it but
[43:50] my servant Caleb because he had another
[43:52] spirit with him and hath followed me
[43:54] fully him will I bring into the land
[43:57] wherein to he went and his seed shall
[43:59] possess it now the amalekites and the
[44:02] Canaanites dwelt in the
[44:04] Valley tomorrow turn you and get you
[44:07] into the Wilderness by the way of the
[44:09] Red
[44:11] Sea after failing to believe and trust
[44:15] in the promise of God the Israelites
[44:16] were forced to turn away from the
[44:18] promised land and wander in the
[44:19] wilderness for 40 years so that the old
[44:22] generation could die
[44:24] off this is all a part of the
[44:27] the history of Israel that we all know
[44:30] very well we all know the story of Caleb
[44:32] we all know the story of Joshua we all
[44:34] know how Israel rejected and they had to
[44:37] die off in order for a new generation to
[44:39] come up that could claim the promise
[44:41] that could go in
[44:45] and take hold of what God had put before
[44:53] them I want to preach this morning on
[44:56] the wrong side of
[44:59] Jordan let's turn to Numbers chapter
[45:10] 32 Numbers chapter 32 and we'll be
[45:12] starting at verse one
[45:29] now the children of Ruben and the
[45:30] children of GAD had a very great
[45:33] multitude of cattle and when they saw
[45:36] the land of jazzer and the land of
[45:38] Gilead that behold the place was a place
[45:41] for cattle the children of GAD and the
[45:43] children of Reuben came and spake unto
[45:46] Moses and to Eleazar the priest and unto
[45:48] the princes of the congregation
[45:50] saying adero and dibon and jazzer and
[45:54] nimra and heshbon and elila
[45:57] and Sham and Nebo and beon even the
[46:01] country which the Lord smote before the
[46:03] congregation of Israel is a land for
[46:05] cattle and thy servants have cattle
[46:09] wherefore said they if we have found
[46:11] Grace in thy sight let this land be
[46:14] given unto the servants for a
[46:16] possession and bring us not over
[46:22] Jordan
[46:24] now Reuben and Gad come to Moses and
[46:28] come to the the other princes of the
[46:32] congregation as they're preparing to go
[46:34] over to take the land they're in
[46:36] preparation to it's time for us to take
[46:40] what God has promised it's time for us
[46:43] to take the land that's been given to us
[46:46] and Ruben and Gad come and
[46:49] say we actually want this land right
[46:52] here because we have lots of cattle we
[46:56] have lots of
[46:57] flocks we have lots of herds we are
[47:00] herdsmen this is what we do and this is
[47:02] the land that will best Supply our
[47:07] needs and we won't take the time to read
[47:10] it all but
[47:12] Moses gets
[47:14] mad he gets upset and he says why would
[47:17] you do
[47:18] this and he goes through all these
[47:21] different
[47:22] things and part of what he's bringing
[47:24] out is are you trying to make
[47:28] all the other Warriors lose
[47:31] heart because you're going to sit back
[47:33] here in land that's already conquered in
[47:36] safety while your brothers go across to
[47:40] fight and that's going to be in the back
[47:42] of their mind as they're fighting
[47:44] they're going to be
[47:46] thinking but they've already got land
[47:49] and they're done they're not fighting
[47:51] anymore we're here dying and still we
[47:53] helped them take that land and now we're
[47:55] here dying and they're sitting back back
[47:57] in
[47:58] safety and if we drop in in verse
[48:05] 16 Reuben and Gad are responding and
[48:08] they say and they came near unto him and
[48:10] said we will build sheep folds here for
[48:12] our cattle and cities for our little
[48:15] ones but we ourselves will go ready
[48:18] armed before the children of Israel
[48:20] until we have brought them unto their
[48:22] place and our little on shall dwell in
[48:24] the fence cities because of the
[48:26] inhabitant of the land we will not
[48:28] return unto our houses until the
[48:30] children of Israel have inherited every
[48:32] man his inheritance for we will not
[48:35] inherit with them on Yonder side Jordan
[48:37] or forward because our inheritance is
[48:39] Fallen to us on this side Jordan
[48:45] Eastward and
[48:48] Moses responds continuing in verse 20
[48:51] and says Moses said unto them if you
[48:53] will do this thing if you will go armed
[48:56] before the Lord to war and will go all
[48:58] of you armed over Jordan before the Lord
[49:01] until he hath driven out his enemies
[49:02] from before him and the land be subdued
[49:05] before the Lord then afterward you shall
[49:07] return and be Guiltless before the Lord
[49:09] and before Israel and this land shall be
[49:11] your possession before the
[49:16] Lord we're going to move forward to
[49:19] Joshua chapter
[49:21] 1 and verse 12
[49:27] and to the reubenites and to the gadites
[49:29] and to the Hal tribe of Manasseh spake
[49:31] Joshua saying remember the word which
[49:34] Moses the servant of the Lord commanded
[49:36] you saying the Lord your God hath given
[49:38] you rest and hath given you this land
[49:41] your wives your little ones and your
[49:42] cattle shall remain in the land which
[49:45] Moses gave you on this side of Jordan
[49:48] but you shall pass before your brethren
[49:50] armed all the Mighty Men of Valor and
[49:52] help them until the Lord have given your
[49:55] brethren rest as he hath given you and
[49:58] they also have possessed the land which
[50:00] the Lord your God's giveth them then you
[50:03] shall return unto the land of your
[50:05] possession and enjoy it which Moses the
[50:07] Lord's servant gave you on this side
[50:09] Jordan toward the sunrising and they
[50:12] answered Joshua saying all that thou
[50:14] commandest us we will do and
[50:17] whithersoever thou sendest us we will go
[50:20] according as he hearkened unto Moses in
[50:22] all things so we will hearken unto thee
[50:24] only the Lord thy God be with thee as he
[50:26] was with Moses whoever he be that doth
[50:29] rebel against thy commandment and will
[50:31] not hearken unto thy words in all th
[50:33] thou commandest him he shall be put to
[50:35] death only be strong and of good
[50:41] courage and so Ruben and Gad and the Hal
[50:45] tribe of
[50:47] Manasseh followed through on what they
[50:50] had said that they would do when talking
[50:53] with Moses they built their City they
[50:57] built the stockades and the fenced areas
[51:01] for their cattle and for their sheep and
[51:04] for everything that they had and then
[51:06] they went
[51:07] on to fight leaving their families
[51:14] behind they go through and over the
[51:17] course of approximately seven
[51:19] years they're in war helping take the
[51:22] land this wasn't something that they
[51:25] were done in a few months this was
[51:26] wasn't something that they were done
[51:28] in a few weeks this wasn't something
[51:31] that they were done in a single year
[51:32] this took a seven-year approximately
[51:35] process to go
[51:39] through and after they were
[51:42] done they were excused Joshua portions
[51:46] out the land and he sends them back to
[51:49] the land that they had previously
[51:54] claimed in Joshua chapter 2 we find
[51:59] that after they cross
[52:02] over going back to the land that they
[52:05] have they build an altar
[52:09] there and all the rest of the tribes of
[52:13] Israel get
[52:16] upset CU they're like are they
[52:18] backsliding already are they already
[52:21] going to worship someone else
[52:24] because the Tabernacles over here here
[52:26] and this is where we're supposed to be
[52:28] offering sacrifices God doesn't want us
[52:30] offering sacrifices everywhere we're
[52:32] supposed to be coming here so why are
[52:34] they building another altar why are they
[52:36] putting something else over in this area
[52:39] and so we find
[52:42] that all the children of Israel gather
[52:45] together their Warriors and Phineas the
[52:48] son of el their priest goes with them
[52:51] and they go to
[52:53] confront Reuben and Gad out why are you
[52:57] doing this
[53:01] thing and they don't speak gently to
[53:05] them they are very harsh how dare you
[53:07] backslide already how dare you do this
[53:09] how dare how could you fall away so
[53:13] quickly how could you already be
[53:14] forgetting the Lord
[53:18] God and as we drop into Joshua chapter
[53:21] 22 and verse
[53:25] 21 says then the children of reuin and
[53:28] the children of GAD and the halft tribe
[53:29] of Manasseh answered and said unto the
[53:31] heads of the thousands of Israel the
[53:34] Lord God of gods the Lord God of gods he
[53:37] knoweth and Israel he shall know if it
[53:39] be in Rebellion or if in transgression
[53:42] against the Lord save us not this day
[53:46] that we have built us an altar to turn
[53:47] from the following of the Lord or if to
[53:49] offer there on burnt offering or meat
[53:51] offering or if to offer peace offerings
[53:53] thereon let the Lord himself require it
[53:56] and if we have not rather done it for
[53:58] fear of this thing saying in time to
[54:00] come your your children might speak unto
[54:02] our children saying whatat have ye to do
[54:04] with the Lord God of Israel for the Lord
[54:07] hath made Jordan a border between us and
[54:09] you ye children of Reuben and children
[54:11] of GAD you have no part in the Lord so
[54:14] shall your children make our children
[54:17] cease from fearing the
[54:19] Lord therefore we said let us now
[54:21] prepare to build us an altar not for
[54:23] burnt offering nor for sacrifice but
[54:26] that there may be a witness between us
[54:28] and you and our Generations after us
[54:31] that we might do the service of the Lord
[54:33] before him with our burnt offerings and
[54:34] with our sacrifices and with our peace
[54:36] offerings that your children may not say
[54:38] to our children in time to come ye have
[54:40] no part in the
[54:42] Lord therefore said we that it shall be
[54:46] when they should say to us or to Our
[54:47] Generations in time to come that we may
[54:49] say again behold the pattern of the
[54:51] altar of the Lord which our fathers made
[54:54] not for burnt offerings nor for sacri
[54:56] Rices but it is a witness between us and
[54:58] you God forbid that we should rebel
[55:01] against the Lord and turn this day from
[55:03] the following from following the Lord to
[55:05] build an altar for burnt offerings for
[55:07] meat offerings or for sacrifices beside
[55:10] the altar of the Lord Our God that is
[55:12] before his
[55:15] Tabernacle and when Phineas the priest
[55:17] and the princes of the congregation and
[55:19] the heads of the thousands of Israel
[55:20] which were with him heard the words that
[55:22] the children of Reuben and the children
[55:23] of GAD and the children of Manasseh
[55:25] spake it pleased them and if we drop all
[55:28] the way down to verse 34 and the
[55:30] children of Ruben and the children of
[55:32] GAD called The Altar Ed for it shall be
[55:35] a witness between us that the Lord is
[55:37] God and that word actually
[55:40] translates as we look at it and see the
[55:42] altar of Ed that means witness and so
[55:45] they named this altar
[55:50] witness now as we go
[55:52] through this
[55:54] and I don't know maybe I'm the only one
[55:57] that as I've looked at this time and
[56:01] here or there through my life I've
[56:03] looked at this as a story that we don't
[56:05] really talk
[56:06] about I can't say I've ever heard a
[56:10] sermon ministered on this I can't say
[56:13] I've looked through what brother
[56:15] brandham talked about and he didn't
[56:18] discuss this situation directly and I go
[56:21] through it I'm like okay I
[56:24] know all scripture
[56:26] is good for teaching and proof I know
[56:29] that all of it's there for
[56:32] reason and as we read in Corinthians
[56:35] it's all of these are given even even
[56:39] there it's telling us all of these were
[56:40] given for examples and for a reason and
[56:43] so over the years I've looked at this
[56:45] story over and again and been like okay
[56:47] why why is this here what's what's the
[56:51] purpose behind it and you can go online
[56:54] and you can look at all kinds of
[56:56] different thoughts or takes on whether
[56:58] it's good whether it's bad whether it's
[57:00] this that or the
[57:03] other and I'm not going to try to cover
[57:07] every possibility with it but I had one
[57:09] thought as I'm going through with these
[57:13] different
[57:18] things in the sermon in 1965 does God
[57:22] change his mind
[57:26] brother brandom says but he has a
[57:28] permissive
[57:29] will now there where the trouble lays we
[57:33] try to work on God's permissive will and
[57:35] he'll permit it but also if we take his
[57:38] permissive will though it's not right he
[57:40] will make his permissive will to work
[57:44] out together to glorify his perfect
[57:49] will now if you go through the original
[57:53] promise that was given to Abraham that
[57:55] your land will be from here to here and
[57:57] this that of the other this land is not
[57:59] included in that this is not part where
[58:02] he goes oh Abraham did wander here this
[58:05] is part of the promised land it's just
[58:07] happen to be on this side of Jordan it
[58:09] wasn't
[58:10] included now God allowed it to be given
[58:13] to Israel and it allowed it to be part
[58:16] of the nation of
[58:18] Israel you can even go that when you go
[58:21] through the history you find that Elijah
[58:24] the prophet came came out of this land
[58:28] that Gad was in possession of on the
[58:30] other side of Jordan now there's nowhere
[58:32] in the scripture that says for sure that
[58:34] he was of the tribe of GAD or that he
[58:36] was any of those but when it's Elijah
[58:39] the
[58:41] tishbite that was in this territory that
[58:45] Gad owned so you can't even look at it
[58:48] and go well there was absolutely no one
[58:49] that ever came out of this land worthy
[58:52] of anything
[58:59] Reuben and Gad the tribes of Ruben and
[59:01] Gad they came
[59:04] up along with all of
[59:07] Israel and they didn't believe they
[59:09] could take the
[59:10] land and then they had to wander through
[59:12] the Wilderness for 40
[59:14] years and through this
[59:17] wandering
[59:21] Israel suffered Israel made mistakes
[59:24] Israel had to fight enemies and they
[59:28] ended up claiming
[59:30] land because they would be attacked God
[59:33] would help defend them and they would
[59:35] end up possessing
[59:38] land now all of these things were things
[59:41] that were taking place outside of the
[59:42] promised land they were still wandering
[59:46] through the Wilderness they were going
[59:47] through this but yet they were given
[59:50] some victories they were given this
[59:53] place and the tribes began to to grow
[59:57] and get
[59:59] stronger as the old that had been
[1:00:02] weakened by slavery both physically and
[1:00:05] mentally and spiritually began to die
[1:00:09] off they were able to grow their herds
[1:00:11] they were able to to grow what they
[1:00:14] would look at as their wealth in
[1:00:15] different
[1:00:17] ways and when they came over to the
[1:00:22] Jordan and they're preparing
[1:00:26] okay it's time for us to take this
[1:00:28] land Ruben and Gad are looking at
[1:00:31] it and they're looking at what is
[1:00:34] already here before
[1:00:36] them and they're going hey this land is
[1:00:39] good for what we have because we are the
[1:00:43] Shepherds we have the herds we have all
[1:00:46] this and they ended up looking at
[1:00:49] it and deciding
[1:00:54] that the promise on the other side of
[1:00:56] Jordan wasn't valuable
[1:01:01] enough now in no way in fact we go
[1:01:04] through the Scriptures it says they
[1:01:05] weren't trying to reject God they
[1:01:07] weren't trying to turn their back on
[1:01:11] him they were no longer even looking at
[1:01:14] it like
[1:01:16] the people before them that had said we
[1:01:18] can't take this land that wasn't their
[1:01:20] mindset they weren't sitting there going
[1:01:23] well I want to stay here because we
[1:01:24] can't take that land we're not strong
[1:01:25] enough were not powerful enough they
[1:01:27] didn't believe
[1:01:29] that otherwise they wouldn't have said
[1:01:31] hey we'll go
[1:01:33] fight they believed they were going to
[1:01:35] be able to fight and come
[1:01:38] back but what they looked
[1:01:41] at is that what they
[1:01:44] had what was already in their possession
[1:01:48] was more valuable than the promise on
[1:01:50] the other
[1:01:54] side they were willing to help
[1:01:56] fight so that the others could get what
[1:01:58] they were looking for they were willing
[1:01:59] to help fight so that the others could
[1:02:01] claim the
[1:02:02] promise but they were satisfied with
[1:02:05] where they were at they were satisfied
[1:02:07] that the with the land that they had
[1:02:08] been
[1:02:15] given God had said there was a specific
[1:02:17] land this was the promised land this is
[1:02:19] where you're going this is where you're
[1:02:21] going to be
[1:02:24] living and we know that when God speaks
[1:02:26] he doesn't change his
[1:02:28] mind if God says this is it that's
[1:02:33] it but we also know that God has a
[1:02:37] permissive
[1:02:38] will and God will allow you to deviate
[1:02:43] from his perfect
[1:02:44] will but at the same time as brother
[1:02:46] brandom said that permissive will will
[1:02:48] still glorify the perfect
[1:02:52] will but you may go through some
[1:02:54] suffering you may go through some some
[1:02:55] pain you may go through some problems
[1:02:58] because you chose not to
[1:03:00] go the way of his perfect
[1:03:10] will in also in
[1:03:16] 1965 does God ever change his mind about
[1:03:18] his
[1:03:20] word brother brandom says now listen
[1:03:23] closely now when the word test came when
[1:03:25] they went over and seen the opposition
[1:03:27] so great the great opposition they ever
[1:03:29] seen the amalekites was 10 times their
[1:03:31] size they said we look like grasshoppers
[1:03:34] their fences or their cities are so
[1:03:36] walled till they can run a chariot race
[1:03:37] around it two chariots as hard as they
[1:03:39] can go around the walls why their Spears
[1:03:42] are way out they're long and they're
[1:03:43] Giants why we look like grasshoppers we
[1:03:46] can't do
[1:03:47] it two men stood on that word Caleb and
[1:03:50] Joshua said wait a minute you two
[1:03:52] million people shut up just a minute
[1:03:54] we're more than able to do it see we're
[1:03:56] more than a match for them what were
[1:03:57] they basing on God said I've given you
[1:03:59] the land it's yours and they stood but
[1:04:02] the people had gotten married off
[1:04:03] amongst other things and all kinds of
[1:04:05] Creeds and rituals among them and they
[1:04:07] just weak wishy-washy didn't know which
[1:04:10] way to turn and what to do that's right
[1:04:12] then came the word test yes he grants
[1:04:15] you permission for to make permit your
[1:04:17] will permissive will knowing that what's
[1:04:19] in your heart he knows it you say well
[1:04:22] brother brandom I do so and so it
[1:04:23] doesn't bother me God blesses me every
[1:04:25] every day I I sing in the spirit I dance
[1:04:27] in the spirit he'll permit it go ahead
[1:04:30] that's right but what are you going to
[1:04:33] do I wear shorts and I do this it
[1:04:35] doesn't bother me I know my faith is in
[1:04:37] Christ not in what I wear but the Bible
[1:04:40] said there's something to it see what
[1:04:43] will you do you'll make a stumbling
[1:04:44] block like balum did before every one of
[1:04:47] the other women what will you do to your
[1:04:49] young girls you'll have a bunch of retas
[1:04:51] that's exactly right a bunch of little
[1:04:53] painted up Jezebel see
[1:04:55] but God will prosper you why He blesses
[1:04:57] me I don't doubt that he blessed balum
[1:05:00] too see certainly he will you're walking
[1:05:03] in his permissive will not his perfect
[1:05:05] will God doesn't change his mind because
[1:05:07] He blesses you he blessed Israel right
[1:05:10] out there for 40 years what did they do
[1:05:12] married wives raised families kissed the
[1:05:14] children pay their tithes lived right
[1:05:16] out there and God blessed them in the
[1:05:19] wilderness fed them with Mana on and on
[1:05:22] and every one of them perished because
[1:05:23] they never kept his original will
[1:05:26] his word they took his permissive
[1:05:28] way go ahead but you remember when they
[1:05:31] left Kadesh they never journeyed any
[1:05:33] farther they just went around and around
[1:05:35] in the
[1:05:36] wilderness where they could have been
[1:05:37] out in two days after that they could
[1:05:40] have been in the promised land they
[1:05:41] journeyed 40 years and every one of them
[1:05:43] died but Joshua and Caleb and the ones
[1:05:45] that stayed on the original
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:51] word now it's interesting when you go
[1:05:54] through
[1:05:55] the scriptures
[1:05:57] here and what you find
[1:06:01] is
[1:06:03] Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of
[1:06:06] Manasseh being on the other side of
[1:06:11] Jordan took
[1:06:13] away a protective barrier That was
[1:06:15] supposed to be between them and the
[1:06:17] enemies on that
[1:06:19] side now we know
[1:06:23] when when they went to Cross Jordan to
[1:06:25] take the
[1:06:27] land it
[1:06:29] was at the time of year when the Jordan
[1:06:32] was super high overflowing its banks you
[1:06:36] weren't supposed to be able to cross
[1:06:37] then and God allowed a miracle to part
[1:06:41] the water just like he had with the Red
[1:06:42] Sea that allowed them to come forth and
[1:06:45] get through and be able to to actually
[1:06:47] fight but if we look at that from the
[1:06:49] other side this was a normal
[1:06:52] part of the Season that the Jord would
[1:06:56] overflow like this and would become this
[1:06:58] Great Barrier that would protect you
[1:07:00] from the
[1:07:01] enemy it was a barrier that would keep
[1:07:04] you apart so that they they didn't have
[1:07:07] a God that would part the water for
[1:07:09] them and so it was meant to be when God
[1:07:12] gave this promise that here's the Jordan
[1:07:15] it's going to be a barrier between you
[1:07:17] and the
[1:07:19] enemy yes there are times of the year
[1:07:21] where they can get across but there are
[1:07:23] other times of the year where this
[1:07:25] completely prevents
[1:07:27] it and there are other times the year
[1:07:29] where it's just difficult it's not easy
[1:07:31] for the Army to get across and they're
[1:07:33] going to think twice about it before
[1:07:34] they come
[1:07:36] through but instead you find that now
[1:07:38] Reuben and Gad and this Hal tribe of
[1:07:42] Manasseh they were able they took the
[1:07:45] brunt of certain
[1:07:49] attacks if we go
[1:07:52] into second Kings chapter 15 we find the
[1:07:56] king of Assyria comes and
[1:07:59] attacks and they take the brunt of
[1:08:02] it most of their tribes are carried off
[1:08:06] in this
[1:08:08] attack now this is as we're beginning to
[1:08:10] see Israel waiting we're beginning to
[1:08:12] see them going further into eventually
[1:08:15] they're going to be completely taken
[1:08:16] into captivity but this is one where
[1:08:18] because of where they were
[1:08:21] placed they took the greatest attack
[1:08:27] because they were on the other side of
[1:08:31] Jordan
[1:08:35] now that there's nothing in the
[1:08:38] scriptures that says they were lost
[1:08:41] there's nothing in the scriptures that
[1:08:42] says they were thrown out of Israel they
[1:08:44] were no longer a part of it in fact you
[1:08:47] go through and Gad it talks about they
[1:08:50] were some of the mightiest Warriors in
[1:08:52] all of
[1:08:54] Israel they were were known as being
[1:08:57] Lion of men that would be some of the
[1:09:01] best soldiers that all Israel could
[1:09:06] produce it was a wealthy land because of
[1:09:09] how much they could make with all of
[1:09:14] their cattle and sheep and everything
[1:09:18] that they raised there because it was a
[1:09:19] land that was good for
[1:09:22] this so they were
[1:09:25] blessed in a lot of ways they
[1:09:28] were receiving a lot
[1:09:31] of on the surface blessings from God
[1:09:34] we're growing in wealth we're growing in
[1:09:35] power all these things are
[1:09:40] good but yet they were still living on
[1:09:44] the wrong side of Jordan they were still
[1:09:48] living outside of the actual
[1:09:52] promise they weren't lost they hadn't
[1:09:55] gone to where they were completely
[1:09:57] serving idolatry or serving some other
[1:10:00] gods at least no more than any of the
[1:10:02] rest of Israel did over the
[1:10:06] years but yet they were still residing
[1:10:11] outside of the
[1:10:13] promise they had still made the
[1:10:18] choice that what they
[1:10:22] had was more valuable
[1:10:26] than the promise that God had put out
[1:10:27] for
[1:10:38] them Matthew chapter
[1:10:43] [Music]
[1:10:51] 25 Matthew chapter 25 and verse 1
[1:10:56] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[1:10:57] likened to 10 virgins which took their
[1:11:00] lamps and went forth to meet the
[1:11:01] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[1:11:04] and wise and five were
[1:11:06] foolish they that were foolish took
[1:11:08] their lamps and took no oil with them
[1:11:11] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:11:12] with their lamps while the bridegroom
[1:11:15] tarried they all slumbered and slept and
[1:11:17] at midnight there was a cry made behold
[1:11:20] the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet
[1:11:23] him then all those virgins arose and
[1:11:25] trimmed their lamps and the foolish said
[1:11:27] unto the wise give us of your oil for
[1:11:29] our lamps are gone out but the wise
[1:11:31] answered saying not so lest there be not
[1:11:34] enough for us and you but go ye rather
[1:11:36] to them that sell and buy for
[1:11:39] yourselves and while they went to buy
[1:11:41] the bridegroom came and they that were
[1:11:44] ready went in with him to the marriage
[1:11:46] and the door was
[1:11:47] shut afterward came also the other
[1:11:49] virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but
[1:11:52] he answered and said verily I say unto
[1:11:54] you I know you not
[1:11:56] watch therefore for you know neither the
[1:11:57] day nor the hour wherein the son of man
[1:12:01] cometh now we know in this Parable that
[1:12:05] as brother brandham talked about this a
[1:12:07] lot and that oil types the Holy
[1:12:13] Ghost well the promised land types the
[1:12:15] Holy Ghost as
[1:12:17] well when you go through these different
[1:12:19] types and here you have these these
[1:12:22] virgins and the scripture is very clear
[1:12:24] that they all
[1:12:27] virgins both the wise and foolish
[1:12:29] they're all virgins they're all living a
[1:12:33] Pure Life they're all living this clean
[1:12:36] life they're all living in a way
[1:12:39] that it looks like they're living the
[1:12:43] will of God like they're supposed to all
[1:12:45] of them appear that they're living the
[1:12:47] way that they're supposed
[1:12:50] to they all hear the cry that it's time
[1:12:53] to wake up the bridegroom is coming
[1:12:56] it doesn't say the foolish virgins slept
[1:12:58] through it they heard the cry just like
[1:13:01] the wise virgins
[1:13:04] did but it was then that they discovered
[1:13:07] wait we're out of oil we forgot to bring
[1:13:08] any we don't have any here we don't have
[1:13:11] the Holy Spirit that we
[1:13:13] need okay we have to go try and get it
[1:13:18] now the call went out and they found
[1:13:22] that they were on the wrong side of
[1:13:23] Jordan they hadn't taken Tak possession
[1:13:25] of the Holy Ghost that they were
[1:13:27] supposed
[1:13:29] to they were still virgins they were
[1:13:34] still
[1:13:36] living a Christian Life they were still
[1:13:40] living in a way
[1:13:42] that was pure and
[1:13:45] holy but they hadn't gone so far as to
[1:13:48] get the seal they hadn't gone so far as
[1:13:51] to get everything that they were
[1:13:52] supposed to
[1:13:57] John chapter
[1:13:59] 6 and verse
[1:14:05] 61 when Jesus knew in himself that his
[1:14:07] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[1:14:09] them does doth this offend you what and
[1:14:12] if you shall see the son of man Ascend
[1:14:13] up where he was before it is the spirit
[1:14:16] that quickeneth the flesh profit of
[1:14:19] nothing the words that I speak unto you
[1:14:21] they are spirit and they are life but
[1:14:24] there are some of you that believe not
[1:14:26] for Jesus knew from the beginning who
[1:14:28] they were that believed not and who
[1:14:29] should betray him and he said therefore
[1:14:31] said I unto you that no man can come
[1:14:33] unto me except it were given unto him of
[1:14:35] my father from that time many of his
[1:14:38] disciples went back and walked no more
[1:14:40] with
[1:14:41] them then said Jesus unto the twel will
[1:14:43] ye also go away then Simon Peter
[1:14:46] answered himl to whom shall we go thou
[1:14:49] Hast the words of eternal life and we
[1:14:52] believe and are sure that thou art that
[1:14:54] Christ the son of the Living
[1:14:56] God Jesus answered them have I not
[1:14:59] chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil
[1:15:02] he spake of Judas scariot the son of
[1:15:04] Simon for he it was that should betray
[1:15:08] him being one of the
[1:15:12] twel we can go through all these
[1:15:15] different types in the scripture and we
[1:15:17] can look at all the different places
[1:15:22] and it's easy and in a lot of places
[1:15:27] very clear to see the break
[1:15:29] between they accepted the word or they
[1:15:31] rejected the
[1:15:33] word here we have Israel came out of
[1:15:37] Egypt they come up and they don't accept
[1:15:40] the promise and they walk
[1:15:44] away here you
[1:15:47] have Jesus and all of his disciples that
[1:15:50] are following him they've all seen
[1:15:53] Miracles they've all heard him preach
[1:15:55] and teach and all these different things
[1:15:58] and they're still there but then finally
[1:16:00] Jesus says
[1:16:02] something that they can't
[1:16:04] take and they reject and walk
[1:16:10] away we can find this
[1:16:15] one but how easy is it for us to start
[1:16:19] to fall into the mindset of we're
[1:16:21] comfortable where we're at
[1:16:25] you know what I'm comfortable with the
[1:16:28] victories God's given me up till now I
[1:16:30] don't know that I need that next promise
[1:16:32] I don't know that I need that next
[1:16:35] breakthrough I don't know that I need to
[1:16:38] be delivered of this this is just a
[1:16:40] minor thing it's not really affecting me
[1:16:43] that much I can still go to church I can
[1:16:45] still worship God I can still feel the
[1:16:48] spirit I can still enjoy myself in his
[1:16:51] presence it doesn't matter that this
[1:16:54] little thing is still holding on it
[1:16:55] doesn't matter that there's more
[1:16:58] promises out there that God's giving
[1:16:59] because I'm satisfied with where I'm
[1:17:04] at I'm not looking at it and going oh
[1:17:07] you're lost I'm not looking at it and
[1:17:10] going oh you're going to completely turn
[1:17:12] your back and walk
[1:17:15] away but yet at the same time we have to
[1:17:17] sit there and we have to wonder am I on
[1:17:20] the wrong side of Jordan right now am I
[1:17:23] too comfortable with the victories God's
[1:17:26] given
[1:17:28] me that's wonderful we thank God for
[1:17:31] every single Victory we thank God for
[1:17:33] every time he's helped us overcome we
[1:17:35] thank God for every single thing that
[1:17:37] he's set us free
[1:17:38] from but we don't stop there because God
[1:17:42] keeps promising
[1:17:44] more God still has it in the scriptures
[1:17:46] and he still holds it going here's the
[1:17:49] promised land here's what you can take
[1:17:51] hold
[1:17:53] of hey are you battling this in your
[1:17:55] body great I may have healed you before
[1:17:57] I can do it again it's still there you
[1:18:00] don't have to be
[1:18:02] satisfied hey you've had breakthroughs
[1:18:05] where you were Weeping at the altar and
[1:18:07] you were loving being in the presence of
[1:18:08] God
[1:18:10] wonderful we can do it
[1:18:12] again I still want to set you free from
[1:18:16] what's going on in your life I still
[1:18:18] want to give you more
[1:18:22] victories Ruben and Gad
[1:18:25] and the half tribe of
[1:18:27] Manasseh were willing to go fight to
[1:18:30] help others achieve their
[1:18:34] Victory they crossed over Jordan to go
[1:18:36] help
[1:18:38] fight but they were also willing to
[1:18:40] leave their wives and children
[1:18:43] behind their wives and children never
[1:18:45] crossed
[1:18:47] Jordan their wives and children stayed
[1:18:49] in the cities that were on the other
[1:18:51] side they never stepped foot in the
[1:18:54] Promised Land
[1:18:58] because they made the decision this land
[1:19:00] is good
[1:19:01] enough my children don't need
[1:19:04] more they're good right
[1:19:07] here they don't need to take the next
[1:19:09] step they don't need to get a
[1:19:13] breakthrough they're sitting on the
[1:19:15] front Pew that's good
[1:19:20] enough they dress
[1:19:23] right when when the world looks at them
[1:19:25] they see respectful kids that's good
[1:19:29] enough I don't need to be sitting here
[1:19:33] and praying for them to get a
[1:19:36] breakthrough I don't need to be on my
[1:19:38] knees begging God to give them the Holy
[1:19:40] Ghost because this is good
[1:19:47] enough we can get so
[1:19:50] complacent and it's not that we're going
[1:19:53] in a place that we're saying we don't
[1:19:55] believe God it's not that we're going in
[1:19:57] a place saying we're rejecting God but
[1:20:01] we sit there and we get
[1:20:04] comfortable in what God has done so
[1:20:08] far I'm not saying don't be thankful for
[1:20:10] what he's
[1:20:12] done absolutely we should be praising
[1:20:16] God every
[1:20:18] day for all the things that he's done
[1:20:21] for us all the things that he set us
[1:20:22] free from all the things that he's
[1:20:24] helped has
[1:20:27] overcome but we don't stop
[1:20:30] there we don't sit here and go well my
[1:20:33] family
[1:20:33] is good enough we go to church we live
[1:20:38] right we do this I don't need
[1:20:43] anymore because God's Still Holding Out
[1:20:46] The Promise going there's more to be
[1:20:50] had yes it means more battles yes it
[1:20:54] means there's more fights yes it means
[1:20:57] we're going to suffer some we don't go
[1:21:01] into the the battle thinking we're not
[1:21:03] going to get a wound or we're not going
[1:21:05] to struggle at
[1:21:07] all there's not going to be some battles
[1:21:09] where the arm is going a little bit
[1:21:10] hungry because the Chuck Wagons couldn't
[1:21:12] keep
[1:21:13] up or whatever it might
[1:21:18] be but you're Reuben and Gad were
[1:21:23] comfortable letting their famili stay
[1:21:26] behind they were comfortable letting
[1:21:28] their families stay in the land that
[1:21:31] they had already
[1:21:33] conquered they didn't need to cross
[1:21:35] Jordan they didn't need to step foot on
[1:21:38] the land of
[1:21:42] promise hey we have
[1:21:46] permission Moses said it's okay as long
[1:21:49] as we go fight it's okay for our
[1:21:50] families to stay
[1:21:52] here that must mean it's all just
[1:21:59] fine brother brandom would share the
[1:22:02] story multiple times about when he went
[1:22:06] to
[1:22:08] Africa
[1:22:10] and I forget which city it was in but
[1:22:12] they were in one city and they were
[1:22:14] having these Mighty meetings
[1:22:16] and God told Brother brandom you stay
[1:22:21] here this is where I want you to keep
[1:22:23] working
[1:22:25] and so brother brandom went and told
[1:22:28] those that were arranging the meetings
[1:22:29] whatever is like we need to stay in this
[1:22:31] building we need to keep doing it here
[1:22:33] this is where God has
[1:22:37] it and they were like no we've already
[1:22:40] arranged you're going here and here and
[1:22:41] here and doing all these different
[1:22:43] things we've
[1:22:46] already released the building dismissed
[1:22:49] done whatever we're
[1:22:51] going and they went back and forth back
[1:22:53] and forth
[1:22:55] and it was tearing brother brandom up
[1:22:58] because not only was it the people from
[1:23:00] Africa the organizers there they were
[1:23:02] telling me this but his
[1:23:05] own organizers themselves brother bter
[1:23:09] and different ones were going brother
[1:23:11] brandom I really think we should go do
[1:23:13] this and we should do
[1:23:16] that and
[1:23:18] so they finally get brother brandom to
[1:23:20] agree to pray about it so brother
[1:23:23] brandom goes and he's praying about
[1:23:26] it his son bill is with him and tells
[1:23:31] him dad whatever you
[1:23:33] decide I'm with you and if God said stay
[1:23:38] here whether we have the money or know
[1:23:40] what we're going to do I will stay here
[1:23:43] with
[1:23:45] you when you read when you go through it
[1:23:47] brother mam says that Billy said that he
[1:23:50] would stay up praying with him Billy
[1:23:53] fell asleep
[1:23:55] much like the
[1:23:58] disciples and brother brandom's
[1:24:03] praying and the angel comes to
[1:24:06] him and
[1:24:08] says Fine they've got you tied up is how
[1:24:13] brother brandham that's whether that's
[1:24:15] what the angel said or just what how
[1:24:16] brother brandham remembered it that's
[1:24:17] how he says is they've got you tied up
[1:24:20] go with them but you're going to suffer
[1:24:22] for it
[1:24:27] and brother brandham says that he God
[1:24:30] gave him these different signs to look
[1:24:32] for letting him know that yes you can go
[1:24:35] into this permissive will here's the
[1:24:37] signs that you will see that will let
[1:24:39] you know that what I'm saying is
[1:24:41] true brother random went to them and
[1:24:45] said God said we can
[1:24:48] go but it is going to be awful the whole
[1:24:51] way through
[1:24:54] now brother random as he's sharing that
[1:24:57] he says there was one meeting where they
[1:24:59] went off after that one town they went
[1:25:03] to where he
[1:25:06] preached and the altars were filled and
[1:25:08] he said that was God's grace giving me
[1:25:10] one
[1:25:16] meeting he said because I was in the
[1:25:19] permissive will God didn't even do that
[1:25:20] but God's grace he gave me
[1:25:22] one and then after after that they were
[1:25:25] struck by sickness they had awful
[1:25:27] weather they dealt with a situation
[1:25:29] where a pastor in this one town was
[1:25:32] going yall promised me that they would
[1:25:34] be in my
[1:25:35] church and his church only held 500
[1:25:38] people and there were thousands of
[1:25:39] people that were there for the meeting
[1:25:41] but he's insisting no you promised me
[1:25:43] we'd have it in here not in another
[1:25:45] building and it was just problem after
[1:25:47] problem after
[1:25:49] problem everybody got
[1:25:52] sick last of all brother brandom got
[1:25:56] sick and he stayed sick and all these
[1:25:58] different
[1:26:05] things we have the permissive will that
[1:26:08] we can go into and the permissive will
[1:26:11] doesn't mean we're
[1:26:12] lost the permissive will doesn't mean
[1:26:15] that we've completely turned our back in
[1:26:18] God we've rejected and we've done any of
[1:26:20] these
[1:26:22] things but God's calling us to his
[1:26:26] perfect
[1:26:29] will Reuben and
[1:26:31] Gad got the permissive will they got
[1:26:34] permission from the Prophet The Prophet
[1:26:36] said if you do this yes you can have
[1:26:38] this
[1:26:41] land and in a lot of ways you looked at
[1:26:43] it they were blessed in that land they
[1:26:45] were able to grow their herds they were
[1:26:46] able to do all these different
[1:26:51] things from purely
[1:26:54] physical standpoint you would look at it
[1:26:56] and go God just enlarged his
[1:27:00] borders he just made the promised land
[1:27:02] bigger it's
[1:27:05] wonderful and in the permissive will yes
[1:27:08] God made the promised land bigger he
[1:27:09] gave them more land to work with he did
[1:27:12] all these
[1:27:16] things but if God said that this was the
[1:27:19] promised
[1:27:21] land then that means that that is the
[1:27:24] perfect
[1:27:26] will because that is what God
[1:27:29] Said and we have the same things in our
[1:27:32] lives where God gives us our promises
[1:27:34] and he says to do this and to do that
[1:27:41] and it's all too easy for us to begin to
[1:27:44] get
[1:27:48] comfortable or as it talks about in
[1:27:50] Revelations to get luke warm
[1:27:54] to get to the point
[1:27:56] where I'm still serving God I'm still
[1:27:58] going to church I'm
[1:28:00] still reading my Bible I'm
[1:28:04] still I haven't gone out and girls
[1:28:07] aren't going out and wearing pants
[1:28:08] they're
[1:28:09] not cutting their hair they're not doing
[1:28:12] this or doing
[1:28:15] that we're not doing anything that's
[1:28:19] obviously
[1:28:21] sin we're even building an altar to to
[1:28:24] remind us that we are part of God's
[1:28:27] promise we're building an altar here to
[1:28:31] remind our children and future
[1:28:34] Generations that we still worship
[1:28:39] God we're not building an altar in order
[1:28:42] to offer sacrifices to some false god or
[1:28:46] go
[1:28:51] off but we're
[1:28:54] content where we're
[1:28:57] at God's given me a good family God's
[1:29:00] given me good kids God given me a good
[1:29:04] job God's given me a good house God
[1:29:05] gives me this that or the other I am so
[1:29:15] blessed but the blessings of God don't
[1:29:17] always mean that we're in the perfect
[1:29:19] will we can be blessed in the permissive
[1:29:21] will we can get these
[1:29:25] blessings particularly when we're
[1:29:27] looking at it from the physical worldly
[1:29:29] standpoint going I'm blessed I have
[1:29:31] these different things I have what I'm
[1:29:33] looking
[1:29:37] for and that's enough I should be
[1:29:41] satisfied with what God's given
[1:29:46] me I say that we're supposed to be using
[1:29:48] a different word we're not supposed to
[1:29:50] be satisfied but we're supposed to be
[1:29:53] content
[1:29:56] we're always
[1:29:57] wanting to take that next problemist
[1:30:00] God's giving
[1:30:02] us but I'm content that at this 11:56
[1:30:07] a.m. on March
[1:30:10] 2nd standing right here I am content
[1:30:12] with what God's given
[1:30:13] me at 11:57 I want more at 11:58 I want
[1:30:18] a little bit more at 2 pm I want more at
[1:30:21] on March 3rd on March 4th on March 5th I
[1:30:24] want
[1:30:25] more but I'm
[1:30:28] content where God's placed me right now
[1:30:30] I'm
[1:30:32] content with what God's given me how
[1:30:34] little or how much that might
[1:30:37] be I'm content
[1:30:41] now but it doesn't mean that I'm
[1:30:43] stopping here it doesn't mean that I'm
[1:30:45] going great I'm never leaving there are
[1:30:48] no more promises there are no more
[1:30:51] there's nothing more for me to get from
[1:30:53] God I'm
[1:30:54] where I'm supposed to be
[1:31:06] at in the church ages in the suban CHP
[1:31:09] age it says they are like the children
[1:31:11] of Israel who came out of Egypt and
[1:31:13] stopped short of the promised land now
[1:31:15] those children of Israel left Egypt
[1:31:17] about two million strong they all
[1:31:19] journeyed together all saw the same
[1:31:21] miracles of god
[1:31:24] all partook of the same mana and water
[1:31:25] from the smitten rock all followed the
[1:31:28] same Cloud by day and the pillar of Fire
[1:31:30] by night but only two reached the
[1:31:31] Promise Land only two were true or real
[1:31:35] Believers that is correct because the
[1:31:36] word tells us that the rest died because
[1:31:38] of unbelief and because of unbelief they
[1:31:41] could not enter then since that is so
[1:31:43] and only two entered then the rest were
[1:31:45] not true believers what made the
[1:31:46] difference two stayed with the word when
[1:31:49] the hearts of the 10 spies failed at
[1:31:51] kades Baria Joshua and Caleb did not
[1:31:53] stagger for they beli the word said we
[1:31:55] are more than able to take the
[1:31:57] land they knew they could because God
[1:31:59] had said I have given you the land after
[1:32:02] all those Israelites saw of the power
[1:32:04] and goodness and deliverance of God they
[1:32:06] did not enter into rest which is a type
[1:32:08] of the Holy Ghost so you can see right
[1:32:11] now that very few will ever believe all
[1:32:12] the way to receiving the spirit of God
[1:32:26] in the leoty and church age brother
[1:32:27] random says 'all right he wants you red
[1:32:30] hot or freezing one or the other don't
[1:32:32] be lukewarm just don't pretend something
[1:32:34] that you haven't got either be on fire
[1:32:36] for God or go on back in the
[1:32:39] organization don't be lukewarm it's the
[1:32:41] same thing now that's the same thing
[1:32:43] taking place in this churches here he
[1:32:45] wants you either hot or
[1:32:47] cold he don't want no lukewarm that's
[1:32:50] what Pentecost has got to a lukewarm
[1:32:52] condition they got on the they get on
[1:32:54] the piano once in a while and a few
[1:32:56] drums and bang around a little bit and
[1:32:58] get enough music somebody get up and
[1:33:00] kind of saying praise the Lord
[1:33:01] hallelujah the music goes down that's it
[1:33:04] oh my just makes God sick at his stomach
[1:33:07] there's not much going on then as a red
[1:33:10] hot revival going on in them but they
[1:33:11] had plenty of mechanical Machinery in
[1:33:13] this church you see because they was
[1:33:15] rich and oh my they was getting together
[1:33:17] and making big meetings and everything
[1:33:19] they was having a good time in this
[1:33:21] church that's all true but it's all
[1:33:22] mechanical machiner
[1:33:24] but there's no warmth of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:26] see look here what he said in here I
[1:33:28] Know Thy Works Thou Art neither cold nor
[1:33:31] hot I would that you were cold or hot
[1:33:34] and because you lukewarm neither cold
[1:33:36] nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:33:39] now he said I would that you were cold
[1:33:40] or hot and because you're not I just
[1:33:42] have to get rid of you that's all just
[1:33:43] sweep you out of my mouth now they have
[1:33:46] plenty of money they had great buildings
[1:33:47] they had great things going on but they
[1:33:49] didn't have no warmth of the Holy
[1:33:51] Spirit they got a United church together
[1:33:54] boy they got the biggest buildings they
[1:33:55] ever had and things going on but no Holy
[1:33:58] Spirit see that's what God sent for the
[1:34:01] church the holy
[1:34:16] spirit it's like I said Reuben and Gad
[1:34:19] weren't thrown out of Israel they
[1:34:22] weren't
[1:34:26] through the years they didn't go off
[1:34:28] into idolatry any more than the rest of
[1:34:31] Israel did they didn't become tribes
[1:34:35] that in the history stand out as they
[1:34:38] were
[1:34:39] always the ones that were wrapped up in
[1:34:42] worldly things or they were the ones
[1:34:44] that were always wrapped up in this that
[1:34:46] or the
[1:34:49] other but yet they lived outside the
[1:34:52] promise
[1:34:54] they lived outside of where they were
[1:34:57] originally called
[1:35:00] to now you can go through and you can
[1:35:03] like I said you can look at it from the
[1:35:04] physical and give the cases and reasons
[1:35:06] for why they chose to stay there and you
[1:35:10] can even make the case that because
[1:35:12] of the way the land is in the main part
[1:35:15] of Israel that if they had crossed
[1:35:17] Jordan they wouldn't have been as
[1:35:18] successful with growing their herds and
[1:35:23] raising their cattle and doing all these
[1:35:27] things and that's
[1:35:29] all valid they might not have been as
[1:35:34] successful because we all know that
[1:35:36] there is no promise in the scriptures
[1:35:39] that says being a Christian we're going
[1:35:40] to get to be wealthy and we're going to
[1:35:43] have an overabundance of
[1:35:47] everything so if they had gone over and
[1:35:49] they had crossed over with their herds
[1:35:51] and their families
[1:35:53] they wouldn't have been able to have as
[1:35:55] much land as they did they wouldn't have
[1:35:58] been able to to grow their herds and
[1:36:00] grow their cattle and all these things
[1:36:02] as much as they did
[1:36:08] there but what would have been like if
[1:36:10] they
[1:36:11] had been more centrally located and they
[1:36:14] would have been closer to the Tabernacle
[1:36:16] and they would have been closer to the
[1:36:18] sacrifice and they would have
[1:36:20] been more Incorporated with
[1:36:23] all of their
[1:36:25] brothers instead of being on the wrong
[1:36:29] side of Jordan having this line of
[1:36:32] separation between
[1:36:34] them they even said at the beginning
[1:36:36] when they were building the altar hey
[1:36:38] we're separated by Jordan and so we're
[1:36:41] building this as a as a memorial we're
[1:36:44] building this altar to remind both us
[1:36:46] and you that hey we're still here hey we
[1:36:49] still worship God hey we still live the
[1:36:53] way that we're supposed
[1:36:54] to they built this
[1:36:58] altar to
[1:37:00] [Music]
[1:37:01] remind both themselves and the rest of
[1:37:04] Israel that they
[1:37:06] weren't forgotten that they weren't lost
[1:37:09] that they were still
[1:37:10] there so even they recognized in the
[1:37:15] beginning the separation of Jordan is
[1:37:17] going to be a
[1:37:20] problem even in that they were going hey
[1:37:23] you know
[1:37:25] what this
[1:37:27] separation this probably isn't what God
[1:37:32] intended there was probably a reason
[1:37:35] that that's the promised land and this
[1:37:40] isn't because if they were on that side
[1:37:42] of Jordan there'd be no need for this
[1:37:43] altar to remind everyone that we
[1:37:47] part of the nation of Israel that we're
[1:37:50] worshiping God and doing what we're
[1:37:51] supposed to
[1:37:57] so even in the beginning whether they
[1:37:58] realized it or not they were already
[1:38:00] admitting wait something is off
[1:38:06] here yes we have permission from the
[1:38:09] prophet yes we're
[1:38:11] in the will of God because this has been
[1:38:14] approved by the
[1:38:19] prophet but
[1:38:22] yet this
[1:38:24] isn't the perfect promise this isn't the
[1:38:27] perfect
[1:38:30] will brother
[1:38:32] brandom Tells a Story one time
[1:38:37] of this person this young man that came
[1:38:40] to him saying that he was called to go
[1:38:44] to the mission field this that the other
[1:38:46] he gives this whole case of yes I'm
[1:38:48] supposed to go yeah brother Brandon
[1:38:50] listens and then goes well if God called
[1:38:52] you then you go
[1:38:54] the guy
[1:38:56] leaves brother brandom looks at the
[1:38:58] other minister that's there with him and
[1:39:00] says he's not
[1:39:03] called he's not supposed to be
[1:39:08] going but he also knew that arguing with
[1:39:11] him wasn't going to do anything and so
[1:39:14] he just said
[1:39:16] go do
[1:39:20] it and so that man walked away and I'm
[1:39:22] sure in his mind he going I've been
[1:39:24] approved by the prophet I am
[1:39:31] set but yet he had stepped right there
[1:39:35] into the permissive will of God he had
[1:39:37] stepped right there into okay I'm going
[1:39:39] to allow
[1:39:43] you and we all have times in our lives
[1:39:45] where we do that we all have times in
[1:39:48] our lives where
[1:39:50] we know what God's instructions are
[1:39:55] we know that God says we're supposed to
[1:39:57] do this or and sometimes it's more blat
[1:40:02] we see it in the scripture God says I'm
[1:40:03] supposed to do this I'm going to do this
[1:40:07] instead sometimes it's that nudging that
[1:40:10] you get on your heart and you're going
[1:40:11] Lord wants me to do this I think I
[1:40:14] really don't want
[1:40:15] to I want to go do this I want to go
[1:40:18] that way I want
[1:40:19] to I think this is a better decision for
[1:40:22] me I think this is is the better route I
[1:40:24] think this is the better thing to
[1:40:28] do and sometimes we can just get to
[1:40:31] where
[1:40:34] we're satisfied with what God has
[1:40:36] already given us we're satisfied with as
[1:40:41] I said the victories that God has
[1:40:42] already given for our families for our
[1:40:45] own personal lives go hey I I know God
[1:40:50] well enough I
[1:40:51] don't I'm not not really digging for a
[1:40:54] whole lot of extra Revelation
[1:40:56] to you know when we're when we're here
[1:40:59] and I'm listening to the Minister preach
[1:41:00] I understand what they're saying I get
[1:41:02] it they're not throwing anything new at
[1:41:04] me there's not a whole bunch of more
[1:41:06] Revelation that I need to get I'm fine
[1:41:09] we're
[1:41:10] good there's not there's not more
[1:41:12] breakthroughs there for
[1:41:19] me we can see the same
[1:41:21] thing and this can happen been in our
[1:41:24] relationships with our
[1:41:26] spouses when we start to get to the
[1:41:28] point
[1:41:31] of I love my wife I've been with her for
[1:41:34] a lot of years now and I know her well
[1:41:37] enough I know I know her likes and
[1:41:38] dislikes I there's not anything new that
[1:41:41] I need to necessarily dig
[1:41:47] for we're we're good
[1:41:56] and yet at the same time there's always
[1:41:57] something more something know well I
[1:42:00] didn't know that you liked that brand of
[1:42:03] chocolate I didn't know that you liked
[1:42:04] that style of dresses I didn't
[1:42:08] know I didn't know you had the dream
[1:42:10] that you want to learn how to do
[1:42:13] this that you want to try this
[1:42:18] new hobby that you want to try this new
[1:42:21] whatever
[1:42:24] but yet we can get complacent and
[1:42:28] content and hey we've got a good
[1:42:30] relationship that's we're
[1:42:33] good it's
[1:42:39] fine and when we talk about that I can
[1:42:42] see all the married couples kind of
[1:42:43] chuckling about the idea like okay yeah
[1:42:45] I don't know everything about my wife or
[1:42:46] my husband I've got to I've still got to
[1:42:48] ask more do
[1:42:50] more but at the same time I think we can
[1:42:52] all knowled there have been
[1:42:55] moments or maybe I'm the only one maybe
[1:42:57] I'm just preaching it myself there have
[1:42:59] been moments where I was like okay I
[1:43:01] don't have to keep studying my wife or
[1:43:03] trying to find what else she likes or
[1:43:06] what else she's interested in or what
[1:43:08] else she's
[1:43:13] wanting and if we find that on the human
[1:43:16] level how much more is that between us
[1:43:21] and our Heavenly savior
[1:43:25] the great Eternal God that had no
[1:43:27] beginning had no
[1:43:28] end how in the world am I going to hit
[1:43:30] the point that I go oh there's nothing
[1:43:33] more for God to reveal to me in his
[1:43:36] word there's no more breakthroughs I
[1:43:39] don't need anymore I've I've got enough
[1:43:41] I'm
[1:43:46] good when do we hit the point that we
[1:43:49] begin to look in the scriptures and
[1:43:53] and we look
[1:43:54] at some stories like this and we no
[1:44:01] longer care to try to find out what God
[1:44:03] was trying to tell
[1:44:06] us I've said before up here ministering
[1:44:10] look going through Deuteronomy and
[1:44:11] Leviticus is rough and there's a lot in
[1:44:15] there that I still have no clue why it's
[1:44:18] there there's plenty in there when we go
[1:44:20] through all the different laws and reg
[1:44:23] ations or go through all the genealogies
[1:44:25] and all these different things there's a
[1:44:28] lot in there that I still look at and go
[1:44:31] Lord I don't see Christ
[1:44:33] there not
[1:44:35] yet and I know brother brandom said we
[1:44:39] should be able to look at every single
[1:44:40] scripture and see Christ I'm not there I
[1:44:43] will admit
[1:44:45] it we go through particularly in the Old
[1:44:48] Testament I go through those I don't see
[1:44:50] Christ
[1:44:51] everywhere we're working on it
[1:44:54] we're trusting that God will give us
[1:44:55] more Revelation so that we can see more
[1:44:57] of
[1:44:59] it but all too often we hit the point
[1:45:03] where reading through these different
[1:45:06] scriptures or reading
[1:45:11] through the different Minor
[1:45:15] Prophets and seeing that hey God told
[1:45:17] this one you're going to lay on your
[1:45:20] side for this many months you can't
[1:45:23] move and then you're going to roll over
[1:45:25] and lay on the other side for this many
[1:45:29] months and you are going to use dried
[1:45:32] dung to bake all your
[1:45:36] food it's going to be typed as human
[1:45:39] dung but I'll let you use cow dung it's
[1:45:42] okay and I read through
[1:45:44] that and I don't immediately go Oh wow I
[1:45:48] see Christ
[1:45:51] there I know it's there and I know I can
[1:45:54] go through and we can find the types we
[1:45:55] can pull them out but I don't always
[1:45:57] immediately look at and go wow there's
[1:46:04] Christ but yet as we're going through
[1:46:06] the
[1:46:08] scriptures it's so easy for us to
[1:46:13] hit this point where we go it is
[1:46:17] common and we hit the point where we
[1:46:19] read
[1:46:21] it and we don't don't immediately go
[1:46:25] Lord can you show me yourself
[1:46:27] here can you give me that little extra
[1:46:30] Revelation
[1:46:31] to be able to see you in
[1:46:38] this Lord I
[1:46:40] see this story about Reuben and Gad
[1:46:45] having this land on the other side of
[1:46:47] Jerusalem or on the other side of Jordan
[1:46:49] I'm sorry
[1:46:53] can you give me just a little bit and
[1:46:57] maybe I'm still not going to get the
[1:46:58] whole picture maybe I'm still not going
[1:47:01] to understand it because most of the
[1:47:03] time the types God has in the
[1:47:05] scripture type in multiple ways about
[1:47:07] multiple things so just because I've got
[1:47:10] one of the types figured out doesn't
[1:47:11] mean I have the whole thing figured
[1:47:14] out but how often do we read
[1:47:17] through the history of Israel and go
[1:47:19] through these different
[1:47:21] things and then we close our Bible and
[1:47:23] put it on the shelf and go okay I've
[1:47:26] completed my daily Bible reading and we
[1:47:29] walk
[1:47:32] away when God is sitting there going hey
[1:47:36] you want to know a secret just ask
[1:47:38] me I want to tell
[1:47:40] you I want to tell you what I was hiding
[1:47:43] right there I want to tell
[1:47:45] you the little gem that's hidden there I
[1:47:47] want to tell you this little
[1:47:49] nugget that's going to let you get to
[1:47:51] know me just a little bit better that's
[1:47:53] going to let you get to know my heart
[1:47:56] just a little bit
[1:48:02] better we get so busy we get so wrapped
[1:48:05] up in life we get
[1:48:07] so wrapped up
[1:48:11] in even doing the things that we feel
[1:48:14] God is telling us to do in certain areas
[1:48:15] of Our Lives that will start
[1:48:18] to forget other areas we'll start to get
[1:48:23] complacent we'll start to become
[1:48:27] satisfied instead of trying to
[1:48:32] push and
[1:48:33] fight and Claw to get that next promise
[1:48:36] that God has put out there for
[1:48:44] us as the musicians
[1:48:48] come brother brandom in the sermon the
[1:48:50] oncoming storm
[1:48:55] he says lot was warned and when the
[1:48:57] Angels though he didn't know they were
[1:48:58] Angels when they went down their message
[1:49:01] was to Sodom come out of this sinful
[1:49:02] Place God has provided a way of Escape
[1:49:05] for you come out of this sinful Place
[1:49:07] Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:49:09] Sodom look what kind of a life they were
[1:49:12] living and Jesus compared that day with
[1:49:14] this day
[1:49:15] sinful watch when let when lot went to
[1:49:18] tell his people they laughed at him made
[1:49:19] fun of him and the sins of the city
[1:49:22] vexed his righteous
[1:49:24] Soul the Angel's message didn't stir
[1:49:27] them had no effect on them but they were
[1:49:29] asked to come out because judgment was
[1:49:31] upon the city and God was going to bring
[1:49:33] a storm of fire upon the city and they
[1:49:36] refused to walk they refused to come out
[1:49:38] they were satisfied with their
[1:49:41] sins people today seem so comfortable in
[1:49:43] sin because we own a new car because we
[1:49:46] can eat three meals a day sleep on a
[1:49:48] clean bed that's
[1:49:50] wonderful but that would be good but we
[1:49:52] for get God when Prosperity comes like
[1:49:56] that I think we've been so we preachers
[1:49:59] and we Christians has been so interested
[1:50:01] in the program of building our churches
[1:50:03] and getting a better church or something
[1:50:04] like that or a bigger Church better pews
[1:50:07] or you know how in what I mean and we've
[1:50:09] left off the main
[1:50:11] thing judgment righteousness power of
[1:50:14] the Holy
[1:50:15] Ghost Resurrection
[1:50:24] Reuben and and Gad and the half tribe of
[1:50:27] Manasseh weren't lost they weren't
[1:50:30] thrown out of Israel they were still
[1:50:33] part of the chosen they were
[1:50:36] still part of the the tribes of Israel
[1:50:39] they were
[1:50:40] still heirs to the
[1:50:46] promise but yet they made the
[1:50:49] decision that this land that God has
[1:50:53] given us great
[1:50:54] victories God has allowed us to destroy
[1:50:57] the kings that are
[1:50:59] here this land right
[1:51:02] here is what we really want what we
[1:51:05] really need this is good enough I don't
[1:51:07] see how the promises of God on the other
[1:51:10] side of Jordan are better than
[1:51:12] this I don't see how the promises that
[1:51:15] are still out there are better than what
[1:51:17] God has already given me
[1:51:25] we have different struggles in our lives
[1:51:28] we have different things going on and we
[1:51:31] get that
[1:51:34] close to getting our breakthrough we get
[1:51:37] right up to
[1:51:40] Jordan and we don't walk away because
[1:51:43] we're rejecting God we don't walk away
[1:51:45] because I don't believe we can take it I
[1:51:49] don't believe we're strong enough I
[1:51:52] don't believe that we can defeat the
[1:51:55] enemy we don't turn away going God isn't
[1:51:59] strong enough to set me free or we don't
[1:52:01] turn away go saying God isn't strong
[1:52:04] enough to do this or do
[1:52:10] that but we sit there and we
[1:52:12] go but where I'm at is pretty
[1:52:17] good
[1:52:20] and you know there are other people that
[1:52:22] need those lands more than me those
[1:52:25] lands are better for raising crops why
[1:52:27] should I take some of their crop lands
[1:52:28] from them I can stay
[1:52:30] here this is better land for what I
[1:52:33] have this is better land for what God's
[1:52:36] given
[1:52:37] me I'll even help them fight through I
[1:52:41] will go up and I will pray for someone
[1:52:43] else at the altar I will help them push
[1:52:45] through to get their
[1:52:48] Victory but yet I'm content to sit here
[1:52:50] on the Pew and not ask God to help me
[1:52:53] break through to my next
[1:52:56] thing I'm content to sit
[1:52:59] here I'm content as Deacon to sit on my
[1:53:02] chair in the
[1:53:03] back and watch others going forward and
[1:53:06] watch others being
[1:53:07] touched and sit there because hey this
[1:53:10] is my job this is my role this is
[1:53:15] enough I'm supposed to keep an eye on
[1:53:18] the order of the congregation I'm
[1:53:19] supposed to keep an eye on the door
[1:53:21] that's my job that's what God has given
[1:53:23] me and I'm it's enough right
[1:53:28] here it's enough being the musician or
[1:53:32] it's enough being the sound man it's
[1:53:35] enough being the person running the
[1:53:37] video or it's enough just
[1:53:39] being a lay person sitting on a
[1:53:47] bench or we get in our mind
[1:53:50] going maybe I'm not
[1:53:53] worthy to get this breakthrough maybe
[1:53:55] I'm not worthy to get a little more
[1:53:58] maybe I know there are promises out
[1:54:00] there
[1:54:02] but Satan's been hitting me with
[1:54:06] condemnation or Satan's been hitting me
[1:54:08] with this that the other and it's I'm
[1:54:10] just not good
[1:54:13] enough to get more Revelation I'm not
[1:54:16] good enough to get the next
[1:54:20] step I don't know what it is in each one
[1:54:23] of our lives but each one of us comes to
[1:54:25] these points throughout our life and I
[1:54:27] don't know if you're at one of those
[1:54:28] points right now or
[1:54:30] not I don't know if you are I don't know
[1:54:33] what it is that's holding you
[1:54:38] there I don't know what it is that's
[1:54:40] making you sit there and go I can't
[1:54:42] claim that promise right
[1:54:44] now I don't know if it's just that
[1:54:46] you're satisfied where you're at and so
[1:54:48] you don't have that real desire real
[1:54:51] push to get more
[1:54:53] I don't know if it's the condemnation
[1:54:55] that Satan's trying to throw at you to
[1:54:56] go you're not worth getting more God's
[1:55:00] not going to give you more because
[1:55:02] you've done this or you've made this
[1:55:03] mistake or you've done
[1:55:09] that but there are more
[1:55:14] promises The Promise Land is still there
[1:55:17] on the other side of Jordan
[1:55:25] Jordan is a barrier that keeps us away
[1:55:28] from the promised land it keeps us away
[1:55:30] from that refilling of the Holy Ghost it
[1:55:32] keeps us
[1:55:34] away from everything that God wants to
[1:55:36] give
[1:55:41] us the other side of Jordan is where we
[1:55:44] get our
[1:55:45] [Music]
[1:55:50] promises and God can
[1:55:53] help you get through whatever the
[1:55:55] barrier is that's keeping you from
[1:55:59] it if it's that feeling of contentment
[1:56:03] God can give you the drive the desire
[1:56:06] that I want more I'm not satisfied with
[1:56:09] this
[1:56:10] land I'm not satisfied with just this
[1:56:13] here because I want that next
[1:56:16] step if it's condemnation if it's
[1:56:19] a Satan telling you you're not worth it
[1:56:23] God says time and time again through the
[1:56:25] scriptures I've paid the price you're
[1:56:29] dead to sin now you're my child I made
[1:56:32] you in my
[1:56:34] image I've called you my
[1:56:38] bride saying time and time
[1:56:41] again my blood has made you
[1:56:48] worthy God
[1:56:51] wants to give us that next breakthrough
[1:56:53] he wants to give us that next Revelation
[1:56:56] he wants to set us free from
[1:57:00] that little besetting sin that's been
[1:57:03] holding you so
[1:57:09] long he just wants you to start taking
[1:57:11] the
[1:57:13] step he just wants you to start moving
[1:57:16] in the direction to claim the promise
[1:57:19] cuz the promise is still there it's
[1:57:21] still
[1:57:26] yours Lord Jesus we come into your
[1:57:28] presence this morning Lord
[1:57:31] and Lord I pray
[1:57:34] that something that was said would
[1:57:38] be would just minister to the hearts of
[1:57:41] the people Lord Lord I don't know what
[1:57:44] all problems I don't know what all
[1:57:48] issues I don't know what all struggles
[1:57:49] anyone may be dealing with
[1:57:53] but Lord I know that you're
[1:57:55] still the great warrior Lord You're
[1:57:58] Still the Redeemer Lord Jesus you're
[1:58:00] still the Healer and you're still able
[1:58:02] to address every problem every challenge
[1:58:06] every issue that we may deal
[1:58:10] with Lord I pray that you
[1:58:14] would Lord Shake us out of our
[1:58:17] complacency Shake us out of the
[1:58:19] lukewarmness that would continually be
[1:58:21] trying to creep into our
[1:58:23] lives help us to press forward towards
[1:58:26] the promises that you've given us Lord
[1:58:28] help us to press forward to take hold
[1:58:30] and claim the promises that you
[1:58:32] continually hold out for us Lord
[1:58:38] Jesus Lord help us never be satisfied to
[1:58:42] just sit back where we're at Lord help
[1:58:45] us never be satisfied that we know
[1:58:49] enough of you or we're close enough to
[1:58:51] you you that we don't need to get any
[1:58:56] closer Lord I pray that you would just
[1:58:59] continue to work on each one of our
[1:59:01] hearts
[1:59:04] Lord and Lord it wouldn't be because of
[1:59:07] any special words that that I may have
[1:59:10] come up with in my mind Lord but it
[1:59:12] would be because your spirit is the one
[1:59:13] that's that's working on each one of us
