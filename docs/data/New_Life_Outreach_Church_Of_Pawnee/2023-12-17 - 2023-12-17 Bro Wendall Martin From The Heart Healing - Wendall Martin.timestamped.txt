[31:57] uh up here on on the front and and uh
[32:01] these boys and girls and you know we
[32:03] just I just love these kiddos and and so
[32:06] thankful for what God's doing in their
[32:08] lives as well this is not a this is not
[32:11] a uh an old man's religion now amen God
[32:16] loves people he loves every one of you
[32:21] young and old he loves every one of you
[32:24] and so we're thankful to God for that
[32:27] Isaiah 53 and
[32:29] 1 it says who hath believed I report and
[32:33] to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed
[32:36] for he shall grow up before him as a
[32:38] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[32:42] ground and he hath no no form nor
[32:46] comeliness and when we shall see him
[32:48] there is no beauty that we should desire
[32:50] him he is despised and rejected of men a
[32:54] Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief
[32:56] and and we hid as it were our faces from
[32:59] him and he was despised and we esteemed
[33:03] him not
[33:05] surely he hath borne our griefs somebody
[33:08] say our griefs our grief and carried
[33:12] what our our sorrows yet we did esteem
[33:15] him stricken smitten of God and
[33:17] Afflicted but he was wounded
[33:20] for our transgressions Hallelujah he was
[33:24] bruised for our iniquity ities the
[33:28] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[33:32] and let's read this together and with
[33:35] his stripes we are
[33:39] healed now Peter would pick it up there
[33:41] in in 1 Peter 2 and 24 he says who his
[33:45] own self bear our sins in his own body
[33:49] now listen to this listen to this
[33:51] language who his own self bear our sins
[33:56] in his own body on the tree that we
[34:02] being dead to sin should live in under
[34:05] righteousness by whose Stripes ye were
[34:10] healed now it was a promise back in
[34:13] Isaiah it was a fulfillment here in
[34:17] Peter let's go to the Lord in prayer

[34:22] you for your compassion upon your

[35:52] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[35:54] the Lord shall raise him up and if Heath
[35:57] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[36:01] him so we ministered this
[36:05] morning centering on the heart and and
[36:08] anything that we receive from God there
[36:11] it's we've got to have a it's got to
[36:14] come from the heart and not the mind and
[36:16] I think I I think I've I I pretty well
[36:19] got my point across when it's not in the
[36:21] mind you believe not with the mind
[36:24] you're not dictated to your mind mind is
[36:27] okay amen you you can you you can use
[36:29] your mind for amen uh God give you your
[36:33] mind and so you choose amen uh what kind
[36:37] of ice cream do I want what color of
[36:39] dress do I want to wear what kind of uh
[36:43] what kind of a girl do I want what kind
[36:45] of a amen job am I going to pick you you
[36:49] you use your mind for this body if your
[36:52] the spirit man is the nature of the
[36:55] flesh amen but God's placed a a an an
[37:00] eternal nature within you that's the
[37:02] soul that's what he communicates with
[37:06] and then that soul from that solish Rim
[37:09] there's where you govern amen uh uh the
[37:13] body and spirit and so we've got to
[37:17] understand that as the soul is is
[37:20] completely anchored with Christ amen I
[37:24] made a statement this morning that body
[37:27] is still owned by the devil amen it's
[37:31] it's not it's not coming to its
[37:33] completion amen it hasn't been redeemed
[37:36] yet that's the reason why we have
[37:39] sickness and and things that still hang
[37:41] on to us even as Christians the most
[37:44] devout of Christians can lose their mind
[37:45] the most devout of Christians can amen
[37:48] have sorrows and troubles and brother
[37:50] brandham would and I got that from right
[37:52] here where where brother brandham would
[37:54] say Amen now let's talk about the death
[37:57] side he says now how could a person on
[38:00] on that estate in that in that kind of
[38:03] condition ever be sick because your body
[38:06] is not redeemed yet your body is not
[38:08] redeemed no matter how much how good you
[38:11] are how saintly how holy how much Holy
[38:15] Spirit that's only your soul and your
[38:18] soul is
[38:20] is uh amen uh is is not completed yet
[38:24] it's it's just got the blessing
[38:27] the promise of God which is the earnest
[38:29] of our salvation but now we have no
[38:32] Earnest of our resurrect uh if we have
[38:35] no Earnest of our Resurrection no Divine
[38:37] Healing then I'll have no Assurance or
[38:40] nothing to prove to me that there is a
[38:42] resurrection so now so brother Bron was
[38:45] trying to tell us God gives us the
[38:49] earnest of uh of the Resurrection he
[38:53] wants to prove that there is a
[38:55] resurrection through Divine Healing so
[38:58] it's God's will to heal God does not put
[39:03] sickness on people he is not the author
[39:07] of sickness he is not the author of
[39:09] death God when Christ came the Bible
[39:12] says there there in Acts 20 for that God
[39:16] was with him and healed all that were
[39:20] oppressed of the devil can you say amen
[39:24] amen so is it God's will uh to heal me
[39:28] well you know we humans just make things
[39:31] weird not God God in all of the Bible
[39:35] has has said over and over and over it's
[39:38] his will to
[39:40] heal it's not God making us feel bad
[39:43] making us think that maybe he won't no
[39:46] no no no you find a place where in the
[39:48] Bible where it says it's not his will to
[39:50] heal it's God's will to heal and the
[39:53] reason why amen we don't get our healing
[39:56] is because because we've got some kind
[39:57] of theology amen that says well maybe
[40:01] maybe not maybe maybe not if you're
[40:04] going to receive anything from God
[40:05] you're going to have to get that
[40:06] double-mindedness out of you and you're
[40:08] going to have to believe God from the
[40:10] heart and accept it as God's will for
[40:13] you can you say Amen yes he is willing
[40:17] come on he spilled his blood for
[40:22] you amen Jesus has a table spread the
[40:26] saints of God are fed amen is that right
[40:30] he wants you to come around amen and to
[40:33] be fed and and brother brother brandham
[40:36] would say amen he would take this and he
[40:39] would he would say
[40:41] now he says now if I were to come to
[40:43] your house and I if I have been asked to
[40:47] come over and and you say preacher come
[40:50] eat with me and he says I believe you
[40:52] love me amen you had beans and potatoes
[40:55] and carrots and fruit fried chicken and
[40:57] pumpkin pie and ice cream everything
[40:59] sitting there well I believe I'd be just
[41:03] as welcome to the potatoes as I was to
[41:05] the beans the only
[41:08] thing I believe I'd be just as welcome
[41:11] to the chicken as I was to the pie it's
[41:13] all on the table the only thing I have
[41:16] to do is say would you please pass me
[41:19] some pie I believe with a good free
[41:22] heart if you if you love me
[41:26] you would say certainly my brother have
[41:29] a nice big piece of it that's right if
[41:32] IID say uh would you pass me the
[41:34] potatoes why certainly my brother here
[41:37] it is and every Redemptive blessing that
[41:41] Jesus Christ died for and purchased in
[41:45] his atonement at Calvary is sitting on
[41:48] the table every believer is sitting
[41:51] before it Hallelujah if I need healing I
[41:55] say father p ask me some healing and I
[41:58] pour it out on the plate and I eat a big
[42:00] can you say amen amen that's right so
[42:03] healing is God's will healing is in the
[42:08] atonement amen so so I I I you know the
[42:12] Apostle Paul amen he he didn't pray for
[42:15] just your soul he didn't pray for just
[42:17] your mind but there in 1 Thessalonians
[42:20] 5:23 he says and the Very God of Peace
[42:24] sanctify you
[42:26] holy somebody say holy amen that is wh o
[42:32] l l y Ho Holy both Body Spirit and soul
[42:39] can you say Amen that was his prayer
[42:41] amen and he wanted it to be preserved
[42:44] blameless until the coming of the Lord
[42:47] you know what that means when you when
[42:49] you need healing amen you you can you
[42:52] can expect God to help you and to and to
[42:55] heal your body when you've got mind
[42:57] problems you can you need peace you can
[42:59] come and say God I need my spirit man
[43:02] restored when you need renewing amen
[43:05] that's what you that that's the that's
[43:07] that's where we stand now I'm not
[43:08] talking about hope there's a difference
[43:10] in Hope and Faith Hope says one of these
[43:14] days a at some point amen somewhere I
[43:18] know God is going to heal me faith says
[43:21] I know it's already done that's right
[43:27] hope says there's going to come a time
[43:29] amen where the will of God will all come
[43:31] in and the and the stars are going to
[43:32] line up and everything going to work out
[43:35] and I'm going to be healed that's
[43:37] wonderful that's hope your stars may
[43:39] never line up the word
[43:42] has been spoke the lamb has already paid
[43:47] the price and you've got to take your
[43:51] faith and appropriate that Faith to the
[43:54] word of God Amen amen I I'm not one of
[43:57] those guys where the stars line up too
[43:59] often but I tell you what I can believe
[44:02] God's word and I can expect healing amen
[44:05] and I'm here to tell you I'm I I've even
[44:08] been experiencing that this last year
[44:10] God doing things for me amen God is our
[44:14] healer God is our
[44:18] provider God is good to his people amen
[44:23] now brother Brandon would say you now if
[44:25] you just rely on Hope You Hinder Faith
[44:27] Hope looks for something way off amen
[44:30] Faith claims it right now faith says God
[44:33] said so in it's mind that settles it I
[44:35] don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm
[44:37] still blind if I'm still sick that don't
[44:39] have nothing to do with it I believe it
[44:42] anyhow it's mine right now and God said
[44:45] so and that settles it that's Faith he
[44:48] says but folks but but but hope says God
[44:51] said so and I'm expecting to get it
[44:52] someday amen yes uh you see I expecting
[44:56] someday as long as Satan can put it off
[44:59] to another day that's as good as he
[45:01] wants that's right you'll never get it
[45:04] just believe you've got it right now it
[45:08] is your personal property faith is the
[45:11] substance of things hoped for the
[45:13] evidence of Things Not Seen is that
[45:15] right Faith acts now it is positive oh
[45:19] my I tell you sickness and everything
[45:21] else when Faith steps in it's like a
[45:24] snowball on a hot stove it just melts
[45:26] away everything goes away from Faith
[45:29] because Faith stands up takes over the
[45:32] rule and when Faith speaks everybody
[45:35] else keeps still Hallelujah he says
[45:38] these little old sicknesses and uh you
[45:41] know uh buring it around like that and
[45:43] little old things and saying well the
[45:45] days of Miracles has passed and this
[45:47] that and the other but let Faith step up
[45:49] one time put his muscles amen and say
[45:52] I'll take over I tell you the rest of
[45:54] them uh keep still When Faith does it
[45:57] that's the fellow we want to deal with
[45:59] amen is that right he says now how do we
[46:02] get faith faith comes by hearing hearing
[46:05] what the word of God now it now that's
[46:08] right you can't base it on nothing else
[46:12] but the word of God it's got to have now
[46:15] if you if you just now you just can't
[46:17] have faith you well I if if if you go
[46:21] over here and touch that it'll make you
[46:23] well or now touch the radio or touch
[46:26] this or the other that just can't do it
[46:29] no sir I got to have something that's
[46:32] strong amen the strongest thing I know
[46:35] of is the word of
[46:38] God now amen so we want Faith to be
[46:42] built on the word of God and I want us
[46:45] to take I want to I want to blow hope
[46:47] out of the water tonight if I can by
[46:50] God's help and I want us to be able to
[46:53] look and to see God's intention on
[46:55] healing
[46:56] first of all God has always provided
[46:59] healing throughout the
[47:01] Bible God's always provided healing
[47:04] throughout the Bible amen there in
[47:07] Psalms uh 103 and 2 we all know it the
[47:10] great psalmist wrote amen it says bless
[47:13] the Lord oh my soul and forget not all
[47:18] his benefits who forgives all thine
[47:21] iniquities who Health all thy diseases
[47:26] does he still forgive our
[47:28] iniquities then he still heals our
[47:31] sicknesses if he still saves he still
[47:37] heals well now now now now brother wend
[47:40] now we know that God doesn't heal
[47:42] everybody it's and and we also know God
[47:45] doesn't save everybody don't we but if
[47:47] there is something in you that wants to
[47:49] be saved that means there is salvation
[47:53] for you to be had if there's something
[47:56] in you that wants to be whole that means
[47:59] there's something in here that God wants
[48:02] to respond
[48:03] to but it requires a deep responding to
[48:08] the Deep God can be saying I I want to
[48:11] save you but if you ain't got nothing in
[48:13] here that wants to be saved amen you're
[48:15] never going to receive it but brother if
[48:17] you've got something in your heart that
[48:19] is saying I want that salvation I
[48:21] promise you you will hear from God and
[48:25] you'll find deliverance and
[48:27] salvation and brother you want healing
[48:29] in your body and you're Desiring that
[48:32] tonight then that means that God is
[48:36] right there ready to heal
[48:40] youall that's
[48:42] amen what about the pool of Bethesda God
[48:46] always no matter what situation I don't
[48:50] care where they were at God always
[48:52] provided amen he always provided a way
[48:56] of healing they're they're in the pool
[48:58] of Bethesda there hadn't been a prophet
[49:00] in years and they they're man they had
[49:04] went through backsliding 400 years amen
[49:08] without Prophet between the Old
[49:09] Testament Malachi and and and the New
[49:12] Testament but even in that time God
[49:15] provided a way of healing for the people
[49:19] even in that backslid in
[49:21] Israel God provided that when when when
[49:25] the would get would would would get sick
[49:28] they could come to a certain pool the
[49:30] pool of
[49:31] Bethesda and God would come down at
[49:35] certain
[49:36] Seasons amen and and and he would
[49:39] strable those Waters so that the sick
[49:43] could be whole can you say Amen aren't
[49:46] you glad that God's a merciful god amen
[49:49] I'm I'm glad that he's a merciful god
[49:52] Israel in the wilderness amen when
[49:54] sickness would would come because of
[49:57] their own
[49:59] sin God would stand up and say I am the
[50:03] god that Health thee amen what caused
[50:08] sickness what caused death in the first
[50:11] place it was sin if there was no sin
[50:15] there would never have been sickness
[50:17] that's right if there had not been sin
[50:19] then there would never be disease there
[50:22] would be no death but it was because of
[50:25] Adam
[50:26] decision Adam sold you and me out when
[50:30] he made the decision Amen to follow the
[50:33] the the the way of Satan there in there
[50:36] in in in Matthew 5 and12 it says
[50:39] wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[50:44] the world and death by sin did you catch
[50:47] that amen as one man by one man sin
[50:51] entered in the world and death by sin so
[50:55] death death is passed upon all men for
[50:58] all for that all have sinned so now we
[51:02] see that the disease is the physical
[51:06] penalty amen of iniquity the day you eat
[51:11] will be the day that you die right amen
[51:15] that is spiritually and that is
[51:17] physically so so where let me ask you
[51:20] where does sickness and disease come
[51:24] from it come from
[51:27] sin right did disease and sickness come
[51:30] from God no where did it come from where
[51:34] did Death come from it came because one
[51:39] man sinned and death has reigned ever
[51:44] since so did Death come from God no
[51:47] God's not the author of death God's not
[51:50] the author of sickness amen well praise
[51:53] the Lord amen in fact there in Acts
[51:57] 10:38 it says how God anointed Jesus of
[52:00] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
[52:01] power who went about doing good healing
[52:05] all that were oppressed of the devil for
[52:08] God was with him now if God wasn't
[52:13] interested in healing then God wouldn't
[52:15] have anointed Jesus but God anointed
[52:18] Jesus you say now this is pretty simple
[52:20] and I want to put it very simple I want
[52:22] you to catch this tonight that the
[52:25] Simplicity of the Gospel will produce
[52:29] Miracles and healings in our lives amen
[52:34] amen now I want us to look over the
[52:36] blood for just a
[52:38] moment first things
[52:40] first it was God who came running after
[52:45] Adam right it wasn't Adam running after
[52:49] God Adam
[52:52] disobeyed and God was fixing God was
[52:56] driving him
[52:59] out but then God stopped
[53:02] him and he says I tell you what I'm
[53:05] going to keep my word amen but before
[53:09] you leave I'm going to shed the blood of
[53:12] this innocent one and I'm going to cover
[53:15] you with that Lamb's skins as a type of
[53:18] its
[53:19] righteousness amen he made an atonement
[53:22] for Adam to cover over to make re
[53:26] reconciliation to atone for can you say
[53:29] Amen so it was God that was the first to
[53:33] stay the lamb now many of times we talk
[53:35] about the Old Testament and the blood
[53:37] and the blood offerings we know that
[53:40] that that Abel offered and a a a more
[53:42] excellent sacrifice we know that
[53:44] throughout all of the Old Testament it
[53:47] was Abraham offered under God a lamb we
[53:51] we find I mean that that was part of the
[53:53] worship amen but the first want to do
[53:55] the to to do the slaying of the Lamb it
[53:58] was not a man at all it was
[54:02] God it was God who made the
[54:05] reconciliation oh I think that's
[54:07] beautiful it was God that done it for
[54:10] Humanity can you say amen amen that's
[54:14] what he' done through Christ it was God
[54:16] who slew him
[54:18] now the
[54:20] blood is the only thing that could
[54:22] satisfy the courts of Heaven God was the
[54:25] first to slay that lamb Abel was the
[54:28] first human to offer blood to
[54:31] God Abraham uh uh offered to God Noah
[54:35] offered a lamb up to God Amen in the
[54:39] Passover it was a blood that was
[54:42] required Aaron the high priest would
[54:46] have the blood as he entered into the
[54:48] holiest of
[54:49] holies so without blood there would
[54:53] there would be no salvation there would
[54:55] be no acceptance there would there would
[54:58] have to be the blood of an innocent one
[55:02] Amen to take the penalty of sin now what
[55:06] would happen what would happen when the
[55:08] sin question is dealt
[55:10] with the cross of Jesus Christ paid the
[55:15] debt the soul was
[55:19] redeemed now I want you to catch it if
[55:21] the soul is redeemed then the body must
[55:27] also be released judicially from
[55:31] diseases the only reason uh death and
[55:35] and disease and sickness comes is
[55:39] because of sin if Jesus Paid the price
[55:43] and you accept that
[55:46] atonement then you have a right to come
[55:49] before God and believe that healing is
[55:52] for you yeah amen praise the Lord now
[55:57] the Holy Ghost is the first fruits of
[55:59] our spiritual
[56:01] salvation brother bradam said healing is
[56:03] the first fruits of our body
[56:06] change amen now now who can who can
[56:10] remove that curse from you now here's
[56:13] the deal doctors tell us and they do
[56:16] what they can do right they will set
[56:19] your leg the doctor will amen they can
[56:22] they they can set your your your broken
[56:24] bone but only God can heal the arm right
[56:28] they can give you medicines they can cut
[56:30] out cancer but only God can heal that's
[56:34] right you can take vitamins and minerals
[56:36] and you can try all of these things but
[56:39] that cannot remove the
[56:41] curse it requires a
[56:45] Believer to come up stand before
[56:48] God and to tell that devil I'm redeemed
[56:53] amen
[56:55] and I have a right to accept my healing
[56:59] amen amen when the blood pressure is
[57:02] high and the doctor says listen it's
[57:04] it's something that has been going on
[57:05] down through generation after generation
[57:07] you have a right as a Son of God to
[57:10] stand up before God and say father you
[57:13] have redeemed me from my sin I have a
[57:17] right
[57:19] judicially that's right amen it's been
[57:23] paid for I am no longer under con under
[57:29] condemnation that's Hallelujah I have a
[57:33] right to come up before God and say I'm
[57:36] asking for the healing of this high
[57:38] blood
[57:40] pressure you have a right for that and
[57:43] there's nothing the devil can do to keep
[57:47] it from you
[57:49] amen unless you're believing here and
[57:53] not standing upon the word of God God
[57:55] that he's given you here that's right I
[57:57] I want y'all to catch me here tonight
[58:00] now listen you can have your vitamins
[58:01] and minerals and amen and S nature you
[58:04] can eat your veggies and you can you can
[58:07] you can heat right and all that but but
[58:09] we're in a dying body amen and and and
[58:12] but but while we're here we can still
[58:15] believe God for our healing amen and our
[58:18] deliverance well can you say amen amen
[58:20] amen so the question is did Jesus redeem
[58:24] us from our
[58:25] diseases at the same time that he
[58:27] redeemed our soul from sin I would say
[58:30] there's only one cure amen for sickness
[58:33] and disease and that's that lamb that
[58:36] died for your soul amen yes sir amen
[58:39] amen he died for both the blood atones
[58:42] for both the sin sick soul and the
[58:45] disease written body Jesus Christ has
[58:49] paid the penalty today now Israel is a
[58:54] type of a Believer today amen and and
[58:58] they were required to apply the
[59:02] blood and to eat the Flesh of the
[59:05] Lamb the very first communion service
[59:08] that was ever held was in Egypt Acts or
[59:12] or Exodus the 12th chapter and they were
[59:15] to kill a
[59:16] lamb and and and they were to paint the
[59:20] blood amen upon the door uh post and the
[59:23] lentils
[59:25] and they were to eat the unleavened
[59:27] bread with the roasted lamb they were to
[59:30] eat it while totally
[59:32] clothed amen their shoes had to be on
[59:36] their
[59:37] feet they had to be packed and ready to
[59:40] leave Egypt this was going to be a
[59:43] supernatural event the death angel was
[59:47] going to strike amen and it was going to
[59:51] be in the most evil of evil times as the
[59:55] death angel was striking the firstborn
[59:58] all over Egypt it did not matter whether
[1:00:01] you were living in in uh whether you
[1:00:03] were a Jew or whether you were an
[1:00:05] Egyptian the blood was the only thing
[1:00:09] that was going to keep death away from
[1:00:12] those houses can you say amen amen now
[1:00:16] you know uh uh uh they had to be at that
[1:00:19] same house amen you could not say well I
[1:00:22] you know I only need the blood and I
[1:00:24] don't have to eat the lamb or i i i i
[1:00:26] amen I'm eating the lamb but I'm not
[1:00:28] under the blood no no no no no you had
[1:00:29] to do it the way God said to do it they
[1:00:32] both had to be it and it was a state of
[1:00:35] urgency that was in the air they were to
[1:00:38] eat this shoes on their feet stabs in
[1:00:42] their hand packed and ready to leave
[1:00:44] Egypt there in Exodus 12: 11 and you

[1:00:49] on your feet staff in your hand and you
[1:00:52] shall eat it in haste it is the the

[1:01:25] Lamb the death angel was striking that
[1:01:27] night amen you go to the 12th verse it

[1:01:38] of Egypt will I execute judgment I am
[1:01:40] the Lord and the blood shall be to you
[1:01:44] for a token upon the houses where you
[1:01:47] are and when I see the blood I will pass

[1:01:57] destroy you when I smite the land of
[1:02:00] Egypt can you say amen amen so so we can
[1:02:04] see the urgency of the hour amen I want
[1:02:08] you to know death is in the land now I
[1:02:11] want to tell you brother bradam says
[1:02:13] back in the 50s he says what is coming
[1:02:15] upon the Earth he said cancer is going
[1:02:18] to be a toothache compared to what is
[1:02:21] coming there's going to be so many
[1:02:23] plagues that come upon the Earth that
[1:02:25] the doctors won't even have anything and
[1:02:26] brother we're here amen we we we the
[1:02:29] doctors just can't seem to do find
[1:02:31] anything to help anybody anymore amen
[1:02:34] you know they can do one thing and it
[1:02:36] kills the other part of you amen but the
[1:02:39] blood shall be a token unto you and the
[1:02:44] Death Angel shall not come near your
[1:02:48] dwelling because the blood now brother I
[1:02:51] want you to catch that amen I want you
[1:02:53] to see that now huh there was going to
[1:02:56] be from that brother Bram taught us that
[1:02:59] that
[1:03:00] Passover because of the eating of that
[1:03:03] lamb and the partaking of that blood
[1:03:05] brother brandham says out of two and a
[1:03:08] half million people none of them left
[1:03:12] Egypt that were
[1:03:14] feeble
[1:03:16] okay Hallelujah the old now now now
[1:03:19] listen when you've got two and a half
[1:03:20] million people they mind you're going to
[1:03:22] have some old folks and you're going to
[1:03:25] have some babies and you're going to
[1:03:27] have some snotty noses and you're going
[1:03:28] to have some sickness out of two and a
[1:03:30] half million but the scripture says when
[1:03:33] they left Egypt there was not a feeble
[1:03:39] one that's some pretty strong
[1:03:42] atonement if the blood of a lamb can
[1:03:46] provide that kind of an atonement with
[1:03:49] God how much more can the blood of Jesus
[1:03:53] Christ
[1:03:55] bring such an atonement your way that I
[1:03:58] Hallelujah I don't care whether you're
[1:04:00] old or whether you're a baby or middle
[1:04:02] AG it can bring you out without one Fe I
[1:04:06] I believe we can go in the Rapture that
[1:04:09] way I personally believe that when you
[1:04:11] Elders when it's time for you Elders to
[1:04:13] go home you can just lay down fold your
[1:04:15] hands and say mama I'll see you on the

[1:04:19] that's right that's true well praise the
[1:04:22] Lord amen Satan said well you're old
[1:04:25] Satan says well you know you've got to
[1:04:28] expect that you know you can't expect
[1:04:29] too much more I mean you're old you're
[1:04:31] supposed to be diseased you're supposed
[1:04:33] to be blind you're supposed to be having
[1:04:36] pains I want to tell you the prophet of
[1:04:38] God says age doesn't matter to God
[1:04:41] that's
[1:04:42] right but if he can use this instead of
[1:04:46] this you'll suc come to this and you'll
[1:04:50] say well this pain is just part of my
[1:04:51] age I want to tell you you can stand

[1:08:57] Brother D was 91 years
[1:09:05] old don't you listen to that old come

[1:09:13] that you can't be and that you he's a
[1:09:16] liar God you you God loves you elders
[1:09:19] just as he's always done the scripture
[1:09:22] says that there was not a feeble one
[1:09:25] among them amen Psalms 105 and 37 he
[1:09:29] brought them forth also with silver and
[1:09:32] gold and there was not one feeble person
[1:09:37] among their tribes I don't know about
[1:09:40] you brother but the blood had that the
[1:09:43] blood under the old Covenant had that
[1:09:48] kind of effect how much more will the
[1:09:51] blood under this new
[1:09:52] covenant
[1:09:54] [Applause]
[1:09:57] can you say Amen yes the lamb the
[1:10:00] prophet of God would saying I'll get to
[1:10:02] it in a minute but the lamb was the
[1:10:05] physical strength for the journey as
[1:10:08] they would eat that lamb and what are we
[1:10:11] doing we are eating the lamb the lamb
[1:10:14] the word was made flesh so this word is
[1:10:18] the Lamb that we are eating and it's
[1:10:21] giving us strength for the
[1:10:24] Journey giving us strength in our bodies
[1:10:27] giving us healing when we're sick giving
[1:10:30] us giving us encouragement when we're
[1:10:33] discouraged as we eat this lamb we
[1:10:37] become strengthened by that word
[1:10:42] amen hallelujah
[1:10:45] now the atonement provided a
[1:10:50] way we get this we get this all mixed up
[1:10:52] Sister Karen
[1:10:54] we think God's only interested in our
[1:10:56] souls God became a human yeah to live
[1:11:00] with humans yeah to feel like a human to
[1:11:05] heal a human to intercede for humans
[1:11:09] right in their weaknesses that's right
[1:11:12] in fact when we get to
[1:11:14] heaven the only God you're going to see
[1:11:18] is a human
[1:11:22] being
[1:11:24] I said the only God you're going to see
[1:11:26] is in the body of the man Jesus
[1:11:33] Christ you mean to tell me that God's
[1:11:35] only concerned for your
[1:11:38] soul God lives in a body yeah true
[1:11:45] yeah the scripture says there in
[1:11:48] Deuteronomy 29
[1:11:49] and5 watch this he says I have led you
[1:11:52] 40 years in the wilderness your clothes
[1:11:57] are not waxing old upon you and thy shoe
[1:12:03] is not waxing all upon your feet that
[1:12:07] atonement did not just cover the soul it
[1:12:11] covered the strength there was not a
[1:12:13] feeble one it covered
[1:12:16] right it provided shoes for them it
[1:12:20] provided clothes for them God was
[1:12:24] interested in every part of that journey
[1:12:29] and I'm here to tell you God is
[1:12:31] interested in your job God is interested
[1:12:33] in who you marry God is interested in
[1:12:35] your hurt God is interested in your Amen
[1:12:38] in in your deepest of pains God is
[1:12:41] interested in the human
[1:12:45] being Hallelujah
[1:12:47] true good point that's why when I deal
[1:12:50] with Ministry I find somebody that's not
[1:12:53] not willing to put
[1:12:55] their make it you know inconvenience
[1:12:58] themselves for somebody else I find that
[1:13:01] they've not really been touched by God
[1:13:03] yet amen because God loves people and
[1:13:06] when you're so touched by God you might
[1:13:09] be in convenience a time or two or maybe
[1:13:11] a three or four or a hundred times in
[1:13:13] your life but you're willing to go the
[1:13:15] extra mile if your brother asks for your
[1:13:18] coat then or your cloak or your coat
[1:13:20] give him your cloak also if he ask you
[1:13:22] to go one one mile then you go two
[1:13:26] miles that's
[1:13:29] why because it
[1:13:32] exhibits the
[1:13:34] heartbeat of
[1:13:36] God God loves people that's
[1:13:42] right oh can you say amen amen now now
[1:13:46] brother brandham says now when you
[1:13:49] receive this bread this is a communion
[1:13:51] remember it represents the lamb
[1:13:54] long years ago when Israel's lamb was
[1:13:57] roasted on over fire and was taken with
[1:14:00] bitter herbs the people had strength
[1:14:04] their shoes never wore out their clothes
[1:14:07] never become threadbear all through the
[1:14:10] Journey till they hit their Promised
[1:14:12] Land may God keep us healthy happy
[1:14:16] serving him until we reach the promised
[1:14:20] land that he has given us how many
[1:14:22] believes that we can accept that prayer
[1:14:24] for
[1:14:25] us I'm a message believer that Prophet
[1:14:29] was praying that prayer over his
[1:14:32] people is he not the seventh angel

[1:14:36] seventh Church age can we not accept
[1:14:38] that prayer for ourselves amen that's
[1:14:42] may God keep us healthy and happy
[1:14:43] serving him until we reach now watch now

[1:15:31] Passover is the blood of the Lamb King
[1:15:34] hez Hezekiah reinstated the ordinances
[1:15:36] of the Passover and the Lord honored the
[1:15:39] blood and the and the prayer look here
[1:15:42] at 2 Chronicles 30 and 17 for there were
[1:15:45] many in the congregation that were not
[1:15:46] Sanctified therefore the Levites had the
[1:15:49] charge of the killing of the Passover
[1:15:50] for everyone that was not clean to
[1:15:52] sanctify them unto the Lord for a
[1:15:54] multitude of the people even many from
[1:15:56] Ephraim and and Manasseh and issachar
[1:15:59] and zebulun had not cleansed themselves
[1:16:02] yet they did eat the Passover otherwise
[1:16:03] than it was written but hezeki prayed
[1:16:05] for them saying the L the good Lord
[1:16:08] pardon
[1:16:09] everyone that prepareth his heart to
[1:16:11] seek God the Lord God of his fathers
[1:16:14] though he be not cleansed according to
[1:16:16] the purification of the sanctuary and
[1:16:18] the Lord hearkened to
[1:16:21] Hezekiah and say it with me heal the
[1:16:31] people they didn't even have their life
[1:16:33] put together they were just coming out
[1:16:34] of bondage they had just paid for some
[1:16:37] sin they were just coming back in and
[1:16:40] trying to get things done right and they
[1:16:42] were not even according to the protocol
[1:16:45] that God had set forth under the law
[1:16:48] yeah Amen on but God honored the
[1:16:52] blood

[1:16:56] blood and he healed the
[1:17:00] people are you hearing me almost every
[1:17:03] time that brother brandham would

[1:17:07] the spiritual and physical strength for
[1:17:10] the journey here's another prayer here
[1:17:12] and proving his word 1965 he says Dear

[1:17:19] when these handkerchiefs are placed upon
[1:17:21] the sick bodies of the people

[1:17:27] that sickness that devil be so scared
[1:17:30] and move away May the people keep the
[1:17:33] journey to the promised land with good
[1:17:36] health and strength as Israel marched
[1:17:38] through the Wilderness and there wasn't

[1:20:32] your
[1:20:33] past but I can tell you that there's a
[1:20:35] blood Covenant that's pretty powerful
[1:20:38] that's
[1:20:40] true and I do know that when Kora had
[1:20:43] led a rebellion against
[1:20:46] Moses and those foolish people
[1:20:49] listened to his poison saying Moses
[1:20:53] you're not the only holy man and we're
[1:20:56] gifted like you and you know God speaks
[1:20:59] to us too there was a plague that fell
[1:21:02] upon the
[1:21:03] people and there were
[1:21:06] 14,700 people died of that
[1:21:09] plague but when Aaron ran out between
[1:21:13] and and stood between the living and the
[1:21:15] dead as the priest interceding for their
[1:21:19] healing the Bible says that God
[1:21:23] seen the
[1:21:25] intercessor and the plague stopped and
[1:21:28] the people were healed
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:35] amen now it's pretty it's pretty bad
[1:21:37] stuff whenever you're talking against
[1:21:38] the man of God it's pretty bad
[1:21:42] stuff and there's a lot of people that
[1:21:44] have died but I'm here to tell you the
[1:21:46] plague was stopped can you say Amen what
[1:21:50] about the brass serpent they're in
[1:21:51] number 16
[1:21:53] amen if you were if you were to read
[1:21:56] there there were thousands of the
[1:21:57] children of Israel that were dying they
[1:21:59] were bit by serpents because of their
[1:22:01] sin am they were they were dying because
[1:22:05] of something that they were
[1:22:11] stupid they they they come against the
[1:22:14] plan of God
[1:22:17] again and serpents were dying were
[1:22:20] killing them
[1:22:23] but God provided healing for those
[1:22:27] Renegades those rebellious Israel
[1:22:30] people I'm going to tell you if the
[1:22:32] devil can make you think that well
[1:22:34] you're not good enough for healing if
[1:22:36] the devil can get you to thinking well
[1:22:38] you're
[1:22:39] you're you know you you you you've got
[1:22:42] you you sin or you you God knows what
[1:22:45] you done yesterday God knows what you
[1:22:47] had in your thought if he can keep you
[1:22:48] down he'll keep you under condemnation
[1:22:50] but remember as long as that blood
[1:22:52] atonement is for your sin you can
[1:22:55] believe for your
[1:22:57] healing Hallelujah now I'm not going to
[1:23:00] hold you too much longer here tonight
[1:23:01] but I want to I I I just I I I just want
[1:23:04] to lay this in
[1:23:06] hereen what did God do he came to Moses
[1:23:09] and said build a brass
[1:23:13] serpent
[1:23:14] amen and when Moses made a serpent of
[1:23:17] brass and he lift it up so that the
[1:23:21] people could see
[1:23:23] those who looked were healed of the
[1:23:25] snake
[1:23:26] bites the brass serpent me sin judge
[1:23:31] brass is
[1:23:32] Judgment man's serpent is sin it's no
[1:23:36] wonder that Christ says if I be lifted
[1:23:38] up I will draw all men unto
[1:23:41] me when I'm lifted up oh glory to God
[1:23:46] Jesus hanging on Calvary took the
[1:23:47] penalty of sin he was that brass serpent
[1:23:50] he was sin judged
[1:23:54] he bear it all to the calvary When sin
[1:23:56] is judged penalty is paid and sickness
[1:23:59] is the result of the curse and when you
[1:24:02] can repent of your sins then you can
[1:24:04] believe God for your
[1:24:08] healing in the Old Testament there was
[1:24:12] an atonement made for
[1:24:17] leprosy amen come
[1:24:20] on you there're in
[1:24:23] Leviticus the 14th chapter you could you
[1:24:25] could find that a man that had
[1:24:28] leprosy he could come before the
[1:24:31] Tabernacle and God would heal him of
[1:24:36] leprosy we find in the 14th and 15th
[1:24:38] chapters that there were types of
[1:24:40] atonements made for the different
[1:24:43] healings God's
[1:24:46] interested in
[1:24:49] healing am I making that clear
[1:24:56] God's interested I don't care whether
[1:24:57] you're old whether you're young I don't
[1:24:59] care whether you have sinned I don't
[1:25:01] care I I don't care I don't
[1:25:05] care if you can look to the
[1:25:10] blood there's an atonement that is made
[1:25:12] for
[1:25:14] you every Old Testament
[1:25:18] atonement pointed to Calvary
[1:25:25] they were all types of the Cross and the
[1:25:27] blood of Jesus
[1:25:29] Christ now when Jesus
[1:25:32] came he stands in the synagogue and he
[1:25:36] declares Spirit of the Lord God is upon
[1:25:39] me Heath anointed me to preach the
[1:25:41] gospel to the poor he hath sent me to
[1:25:44] heal the
[1:25:46] brokenhearted to preach deliverances I
[1:25:49] want you to catch that brokenhearted
[1:25:50] it's the spirit to preach Deliverance to
[1:25:53] the captives that's the soul and the
[1:25:55] recovering of the sight to the blind
[1:25:57] that's the body to set at Liberty them
[1:26:00] that are bruised spirit and soul to
[1:26:03] preach the acceptable
[1:26:05] year of the
[1:26:08] Lord now what was he doing now now now
[1:26:11] now stay with me I know I know it's hard
[1:26:13] on Wednesday night or on Sunday nights
[1:26:15] like this have we've been Sunday nights
[1:26:17] are long
[1:26:20] days and I know I'm putting a hole whole
[1:26:22] bunch of stuff in
[1:26:27] here but what was Jesus doing he was
[1:26:30] referring to the Old Testament Year of
[1:26:33] Jubilee so when Jesus was saying this
[1:26:36] here the old I I I've come to set the
[1:26:38] free and he says it's going to be Body
[1:26:40] Soul and Spirit that every man could
[1:26:43] return to his possession and that's the
[1:26:45] reason why he said to preach the
[1:26:48] acceptable year of the Lord now what was
[1:26:51] that accept cable year Leviticus 25:9
[1:26:54] when thou shalt cause the trumpet of the
[1:26:56] Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the
[1:26:58] seventh month in the day of atonement
[1:27:01] you shall you make the trumpet sound
[1:27:03] throughout all of your land and you
[1:27:05] shall Hollow that 50th year and Proclaim
[1:27:08] Liberty throughout all the land unto the
[1:27:10] inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[1:27:12] jubilee unto you and you shall return
[1:27:14] every man into his possession and you
[1:27:17] shall return every man to his family now
[1:27:20] this was what Jesus was saying I've come
[1:27:23] to preach the
[1:27:26] acceptable Year of
[1:27:28] Jubilee that you can have your healing
[1:27:31] back you can have your sight back you
[1:27:35] can have your marriage back you can have
[1:27:38] your salvation back you can have it back
[1:27:43] if you'll accept
[1:27:45] it that's good it's yours for the taken
[1:27:49] that's right don't reason it here you've
[1:27:53] got to accept it yes amen am I laying it
[1:27:57] in there for you
[1:27:59] yes am I doing this in vain are you
[1:28:03] catching what I'm saying here tonight
[1:28:05] can you say Amen shall be a jubilee unto
[1:28:09] you it's no wonder when Jesus now watch
[1:28:11] watch watch what we talk about when
[1:28:14] Jesus says this day is this scripture
[1:28:16] fulfilled let's let's let's look and see
[1:28:18] what he says amen there in Matthews 8
[1:28:21] and16 and when the evening was come they
[1:28:24] brought unto him many that were
[1:28:25] possessed with devils and he cast out
[1:28:27] the spirits with his word and healed all
[1:28:30] that were a sick that it might be
[1:28:34] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the
[1:28:36] prophet saying himself took our
[1:28:39] infirmities and bear our
[1:28:43] weakness the trumpet was to sound after
[1:28:46] an atonement was made the atonement was
[1:28:50] made and the sound of the trumpet and
[1:28:53] that's what I'm here for tonight I am
[1:28:55] blowing the gospel trumpet saying you're
[1:28:58] free you're healed if you can accept it
[1:29:03] you can have
[1:29:05] it it's yours I am blowing right here at
[1:29:09] New Life Church py
[1:29:13] Oklahoma that's
[1:29:15] good healing belongs to
[1:29:18] you because the lamb has paid the price
[1:29:23] that's right it don't matter whether
[1:29:25] you're young it don't matter whether
[1:29:27] you're old brother D was
[1:29:32] 91 and the he outlived the doctor that
[1:29:35] pronounced death on
[1:29:40] him well glory to God can you say Amen
[1:29:44] yes yes the bulock was slain the blood
[1:29:49] was sprinkled on The Mercy Seat now
[1:29:51] remember if there was no blood then
[1:29:53] there was uh then then it's a judgment
[1:29:56] seat amen without the shedding of blood
[1:29:58] there is no remission of sin so if
[1:29:59] there's no blood it's a judgment seat
[1:30:02] but when you put the blood on the
[1:30:03] Judgment seat then it becomes The Mercy
[1:30:06] Seat it's the same seat it's the same
[1:30:09] seat Christ is not changing seats it's
[1:30:12] just going to be one day will be the
[1:30:14] Judgment seat but now it's The Mercy
[1:30:17] Seat the blood makes the difference
[1:30:21] that's right
[1:30:22] God can't be killing you and saving you
[1:30:24] at the same time it's God's desire to
[1:30:27] heal
[1:30:29] you that's
[1:30:33] right well glory to
[1:30:35] God now remember the Year of Jubilee was
[1:30:39] initiated by the blood of the
[1:30:41] Lamb amen then the trumpet sounded
[1:30:43] saying you are free every man can return
[1:30:45] to his possession it didn't matter if
[1:30:46] they had lost it 30 years earlier and
[1:30:49] they didn't nothing too far gone though
[1:30:52] it was a mess of their own making it
[1:30:54] does not matter these these people in
[1:30:57] the Year of Jubilee the reason why they
[1:30:59] become slaves is because they were
[1:31:01] slothful they
[1:31:04] they they didn't take care of good
[1:31:08] business but on that 50th year don't you
[1:31:11] come up like
[1:31:15] this I blew it but can I have my house
[1:31:17] back no no no no no no no it was the
[1:31:20] Year of Jubilee don't be looking to the
[1:31:22] past there was a lamb that was just
[1:31:24] saying that Year of Jubilee was the
[1:31:27] slang of the lamb and then the trumpet
[1:31:29] sounded every man can go back to his
[1:31:33] possession oh Church of God Amen we live
[1:31:37] in this condemnation the trumpet is
[1:31:41] sounding that there is nothing held
[1:31:44] against you you can go back to what God
[1:31:49] has given you at the beginning
[1:31:53] you can have healing you can have peace
[1:31:57] you can be delivered you can have it
[1:32:01] it's in the
[1:32:03] atonement

[1:32:20] 527 yeah how

[1:32:30] Tidings that publishes peace that
[1:32:34] bringeth good tidings of good that
[1:32:36] publishes salvation that sayth unto
[1:32:39] Zion thy God Reigns Apostle Paul picks
[1:32:43] it right back up in the New Testament
[1:32:46] and he says the preacher how beautiful
[1:32:49] are the feet of them
[1:32:52] that preaches this
[1:32:55] gospel the trumpet is

[1:33:42] in the past and I know that I've blown
[1:33:44] it and I here I am I'm living in the
[1:33:46] regrets of my past but that's not what
[1:33:49] in Romans the 10th chapter tells us
[1:33:53] when the word that's the gospel trumpet
[1:33:55] was sounded amen and and and it says
[1:33:58] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:34:00] the word of God and he goes down through
[1:34:02] it and if you go down to the 13th verse
[1:34:04] I believe it's it's Romans 10: 13 and it
[1:34:06] says and
[1:34:08] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[1:34:12] Lord shall be
[1:34:15] saved Body Soul
[1:34:19] Spirit there you go salvation comes to
[1:34:23] the three salvation is not just the soul
[1:34:26] when you take care of the Soul it covers
[1:34:29] spirit and
[1:34:31] body
[1:34:33] whosoever believes
[1:34:36] whosoever receives shall be
[1:34:41] [Applause]

[1:35:19] building are there any who whoevers
[1:35:22] whoever shall call upon the name of the
[1:35:25] Lord shall be
[1:35:27] saved that's what the Jubilee trumpet is

[1:35:33] anointed to do
[1:35:38] this

[1:40:05] Christ that's what God does God brings
[1:40:09] you back to him you are Sons and
[1:40:13] Daughters of
[1:40:18] God condemnation will strike you
[1:40:21] the enemy but you're under a blood
[1:40:26] Covenant how dare any man Point his
[1:40:28] finger at you how dare any man put his
[1:40:32] finger to God's elect it is God that
[1:40:37] justifies what shall separate me from
[1:40:40] the love of God which is in Christ
[1:40:44] Jesus now I'm an overcomer in all
[1:40:48] things don't care whether it's life or
[1:40:50] death
[1:40:52] it don't matter it don't matter to me I
[1:40:54] found my security in him he and he alone
[1:40:59] deserves any kind of say about
[1:41:02] me because he and he alone is the only
[1:41:06] one that shed his blood to redeem
[1:41:13] me denominations try to keep you under
[1:41:16] the thumb get out of that denominational
[1:41:18] thinking get out of the thumb the devil
[1:41:21] get out of the thumb of what a man
[1:41:23] thinks about
[1:41:30] you come under this anointed
[1:41:34] word because you are
[1:41:37] married to the living bloody bleeding

[1:42:19] say what brother brandom said Hallelujah
[1:42:22] Hallelujah and I'm expanding
[1:42:26] daily oh yes he what is what is the
[1:42:31] preacher what is the preacher doing what
[1:42:34] am I doing today what do the men of God
[1:42:36] do when they're behind this Pulpit amen
[1:42:39] well here's the scripture that I had you
[1:42:40] look at a while ago amen uh you can put
[1:42:43] it back up there Romans 10 and 13 for
[1:42:45] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:42:47] the Lord shall be saved how then shall
[1:42:49] they call on him in whom they have not
[1:42:51] believed how then shall they believe in
[1:42:53] him whom they have not heard how shall
[1:42:56] they hear without a preacher how shall
[1:42:58] they preach except they be sent as it is
[1:43:00] written how beautiful are the feet of
[1:43:03] them that preach or proclaim the gospel
[1:43:05] of
[1:43:06] peace and bring Good Tidings of good
[1:43:13] things the
[1:43:16] power of the atoning
[1:43:19] blood
[1:43:26] Gentiles you are Heathen of
[1:43:28] heathens but just as I showed the
[1:43:31] type of Ruth who was the
[1:43:35] monias who was the priest and their
[1:43:40] God of of of Baal I believe it
[1:43:44] was and though my words
[1:43:48] said that the Moab will be an enemy to
[1:43:52] me as long as they
[1:43:59] live
[1:44:01] yet I've
[1:44:03] Loved this girl named Ruth the
[1:44:07] moabitas come on come on she's not just
[1:44:12] a moabitas but she is the daughter of
[1:44:15] the priest the high man in the in the of
[1:44:19] the moabites and she comes over and God
[1:44:23] makes her a part of his
[1:44:27] lineage
[1:44:30] Hallelujah she had to get away from
[1:44:35] this and she had to go with this if she
[1:44:38] would have stayed there talking to Ruth
[1:44:39] saying I know I've done heard of what
[1:44:41] your God thinks about me I've done heard
[1:44:43] what they said what your God said about
[1:44:45] the moabites I don't I know what he said
[1:44:48] about me I'm not going over there
[1:44:49] they'll kill me
[1:44:52] but what she what she say she said your
[1:44:55] God shall be my God your people shall be
[1:45:00] my people where you live I live where
[1:45:02] you die I die I'm
[1:45:05] going and God says welcome to the fold
[1:45:08] welcome to the family you're
[1:45:12] mine and the blood covered over the
[1:45:15] blood covered over
[1:45:19] everything
[1:45:23] if he can cleanse leprosy he can cleanse
[1:45:30] you my spirit will be upon you and
[1:45:34] you'll re receive power to be my
[1:45:36] Witnesses and you will openly show this
[1:45:39] at
[1:45:40] atonement he says there in Luke
[1:45:43] 2448 behold I send the promise of my
[1:45:46] father but Harry into the city of
[1:45:48] Jerusalem until you be endured
[1:45:51] with power from on
[1:45:53] high now as I stop here
[1:46:01] now got to the
[1:46:04] church he knew Mom he knew that we were
[1:46:08] going to need
[1:46:12] healing God knew after the day of
[1:46:14] Pentecost that we were going to need
[1:46:16] healing now he provided it under the Old
[1:46:19] Testament the old it he provided it for
[1:46:21] Israel all through that
[1:46:23] time from the very beginning God slew a
[1:46:26] lamb for Adam and Eve and God was always
[1:46:29] providing an
[1:46:31] atonement but now what about our
[1:46:35] day God says I'm not going to leave you
[1:46:40] comfortless but I'm going to give gifts
[1:46:42] unto
[1:46:45] man and and and and he says there in 1
[1:46:48] Corinthians 12:8 for to one is given by
[1:46:52] the spirit the word of wisdom to another
[1:46:55] the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit
[1:46:56] to another Faith by The Same Spirit to
[1:47:01] another the gift gifts of healing by The
[1:47:05] Same
[1:47:06] Spirit to another the working of
[1:47:08] Miracles to another prophecy to another
[1:47:10] discernment of spirits to another div
[1:47:13] diverse kinds of tongues to another
[1:47:14] interpretation of
[1:47:17] tongues this was all provided the
[1:47:20] atonement provided this for the
[1:47:24] church now too many people try to take
[1:47:26] that out but as long as I'm still in
[1:47:28] this Mortal body I I need I need those
[1:47:32] things those are God's gifts to the
[1:47:36] church that the
[1:47:38] blood paid for for us now brother
[1:47:41] Brandon says gifts plural of healing
[1:47:46] plural many gifts of healing he says you
[1:47:50] can be healed by
[1:47:52] love he says you can be healed by
[1:47:57] music he says you can be healed by
[1:48:00] doctors he says oh yes those are gifts
[1:48:03] given to the
[1:48:06] church however it
[1:48:12] comes God wants to bring
[1:48:19] healing
[1:48:26] bless the
[1:48:29] Lord Brother
[1:48:32] brandham tells the
[1:48:34] story in closing he he tells the story
[1:48:39] of the
[1:48:43] man was one of his sponsors in Topeka
[1:48:46] Kansas
[1:48:49] and
[1:48:51] he was a young preacher he said he was a
[1:48:53] boy a young preacher one of my first
[1:48:57] sponsors he said this Minister had
[1:49:00] gotten
[1:49:02] under had been pinned under under a roof
[1:49:07] or a wall mashed him down underneath
[1:49:13] it he said the young fellow was going to
[1:49:15] die his liver was bursted his spleen was
[1:49:18] knocked out of place tons fell on
[1:49:21] him I sat at breakfast talking to my
[1:49:23] wife and I said
[1:49:27] wife you know if Jesus was
[1:49:31] here you know what he'd
[1:49:34] do I said when he sponsored
[1:49:38] me I believed that word and he he was
[1:49:41] sponsoring
[1:49:45] Christ I said now that's a trick of the
[1:49:48] devil I said if Jesus was was here he'd
[1:49:50] go lay his holy hand upon him and the
[1:49:52] boy would get
[1:49:55] well I don't care if his liver has
[1:49:58] bursted he would get well because Jesus
[1:50:00] would walk in there knowing exactly what
[1:50:04] he who he was he knowed his calling the
[1:50:07] scripture was right vindicating in him
[1:50:09] that he knowed who he was not a Shadow
[1:50:12] of Doubt he'd lay his hands upon him and
[1:50:15] say son be well and then he'd walk out
[1:50:18] of
[1:50:19] there
[1:50:24] I said
[1:50:26] there isn't enough devils in hell to
[1:50:28] kill the boy then he would get well but
[1:50:32] I said you see honey he was Jesus the
[1:50:35] holy hands of God I said I'm a sinner
[1:50:39] I'm born sexual birth my father and
[1:50:42] mother were both Sinners I'm just a no
[1:50:44] good
[1:50:45] nothing and I said you but you know what
[1:50:47] if the Lord would give me a video vision
[1:50:51] and send me down there then that would
[1:50:53] be different I'd go down there and lay
[1:50:54] my hand on him and he'd come out of that
[1:50:56] bed if he'd give me a
[1:50:59] vision and then I got to
[1:51:02] thinking after all if it was the vision
[1:51:05] what was
[1:51:06] it it was the same dirty hands on
[1:51:10] him he says the same man praying for him
[1:51:15] the same dirty hands then I begin to
[1:51:18] think I'm his representative
[1:51:21] then God doesn't see me the blood of the
[1:51:25] righteous one lays upon that
[1:51:29] altar it makes intercession for me he is
[1:51:32] my sufficiency he is my prayer he is my
[1:51:37] life I said the only thing that makes me
[1:51:39] put my hands on him with faith is
[1:51:42] because I had the vision faith in the
[1:51:44] vision and without the vision the same
[1:51:47] Faith would do the same thing so I can
[1:51:49] reckon myself nothing but reckon him my
[1:51:51] all in all he's my life he's my
[1:51:55] commissioner no denomination sent me he
[1:51:57] sent me Hallelujah I go in his name I'll
[1:52:00] lay hands upon him I walked down there
[1:52:03] laid my hands on that boy and that night
[1:52:05] he was in the meeting solid and
[1:52:11] well oh yes he is that Fountain no other
[1:52:15] Fountain I know nothing but the blood of
[1:52:17] Jesus I'm a stinker I'm a renegade every
[1:52:20] one of us are but before God we are
[1:52:22] perfect be ye therefore perfect even as
[1:52:25] your father in Heaven is perfect how can
[1:52:27] you be because a perfect one represents
[1:52:31] us there that Fountain is there every
[1:52:35] day fresh not some stagnated something
[1:52:38] but the fresh every day that washes away
[1:52:40] all my sins he is that Fountain amen can
