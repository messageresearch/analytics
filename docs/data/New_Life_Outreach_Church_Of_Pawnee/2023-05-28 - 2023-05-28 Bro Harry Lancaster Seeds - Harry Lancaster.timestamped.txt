[42:44] amen
[42:47] let's turn to Matthew chapter 7.
[43:06] Matthew chapter 7 and starting at verse
[43:08] 15.
[43:16] beware of false prophets which come to
[43:20] you in sheep's clothing
[43:21] but inwardly they are ravening wolves
[43:24] you shall know them by their fruits
[43:26] do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs
[43:29] of thistles
[43:30] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[43:33] good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth
[43:36] forth evil fruit
[43:37] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[43:40] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[43:42] forth good fruit
[43:44] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[43:46] fruit is hewn down and cast Into the
[43:49] Fire
[43:50] wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
[43:53] them
[43:55] you all can have your seats
[44:03] let's turn back to Genesis
[44:07] chapter 2
[44:12] and
[44:14] excuse me for a few minutes while we go
[44:15] through a couple different scriptures
[44:17] just to kind of begin to set a
[44:19] foundation of where we're going to be
[44:20] going this morning but Genesis chapter 2
[44:23] and
[44:25] starting at verse 8
[44:27] and the Lord God planted a garden
[44:29] Eastward in Eden
[44:30] and there he put the man whom he had
[44:32] formed
[44:34] and out of the ground made the Lord God
[44:36] to grow every tree that is Pleasant to
[44:37] the site and good for food the tree of
[44:40] life also in the midst of the garden and
[44:42] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[44:45] so we're going to go on to Genesis
[44:47] chapter 3.
[44:51] we'll start with verse 7.
[44:56] and the eyes of them both were opened
[44:58] and they knew that they were naked and
[45:01] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[45:04] themselves aprons
[45:06] then we're going to drop down to verse
[45:07] 21.
[45:11] unto Adam also unto his wife did the
[45:13] Lord God make coats of skins and clothed
[45:16] them
[45:18] and then going on to Genesis chapter 4.
[45:23] and verse 3.
[45:25] and in the process of time it came to
[45:27] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[45:29] the ground and offering unto the Lord
[45:31] and Abel he also brought of the first
[45:34] sling of his flock and of the fat
[45:35] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[45:38] Abel and to his offering
[45:40] but unto Cain and to his offering he had
[45:42] not respect and Cain was very Roth in
[45:45] his countenance fell
[45:48] and then we're going to turn to Hebrews
[45:50] chapter 11.
[46:01] Hebrews chapter 11.
[46:05] and verse 4.
[46:09] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[46:12] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[46:14] he obtained witness that he was
[46:16] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[46:19] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[46:29] Cain and Abel didn't have
[46:31] a written bible to reference
[46:35] the scriptures hadn't been put out yet
[46:38] but they did have parents
[46:41] and
[46:42] I want you to just think for a little
[46:44] bit and kind of Imagine
[46:47] them sitting around and hearing the
[46:50] stories from from their father and from
[46:53] their mother as they're sitting there
[46:54] and here you have
[46:57] Adam and he's and Eve and they're
[46:59] they're talking about the beauty of the
[47:01] garden they're talking about where they
[47:03] were and what they experienced the
[47:05] Perfection how everything was just right
[47:10] and I can you can just picture here's
[47:12] both Cain and Abel sitting there you
[47:14] know their eyes may be just a little bit
[47:16] wide as they're getting the story of the
[47:18] thing that they didn't get to experience
[47:21] it was Adam and Eve that were there and
[47:23] here they are they're sharing and
[47:24] they're talking about it and I can see
[47:26] them as most parents are where
[47:30] as their kids are at certain age they're
[47:32] gonna shelter them up to a point be like
[47:34] okay I can't tell you every single
[47:36] detail yet
[47:37] you know it's the same thing with with
[47:38] my children what I can tell my daughter
[47:41] at eight years old is not the same as
[47:44] what I can share with my son that is 14
[47:46] years old they have different levels of
[47:49] understanding they have different levels
[47:50] of what they can take and so as these
[47:52] boys are growing maybe they start out as
[47:54] they're they're telling the story and
[47:56] they talk about the how they failed in
[47:58] the garden but they don't really go into
[47:59] details about it
[48:01] it's you know we made a mistake we
[48:04] disobeyed and so God cast us out of the
[48:06] garden
[48:07] that's it maybe that's all they share
[48:09] because
[48:11] partly they're protecting their children
[48:13] and partly they're sitting there in
[48:15] their own embarrassment and shame over
[48:17] what they went through
[48:20] but then as the children get older they
[48:22] start
[48:23] maybe sharing just a little bit more
[48:25] being just a little more explicit and
[48:28] finally comes the day where you can see
[48:31] I can picture Adam taking his boys
[48:34] and walking and traveling with them to
[48:37] the point where they can see the garden
[48:39] in the distance they can see that gate
[48:42] of the garden where they can't get in
[48:44] because the angel is there defending it
[48:46] but they can he can point it out to him
[48:48] be like that was where we were
[48:51] that was where we came from that was
[48:53] where we were living
[48:55] and this is what happened
[49:00] your mother was deceived
[49:03] and then I went and I took part in it as
[49:06] well
[49:07] and we went and we
[49:09] knew that we were naked we knew that we
[49:12] were exposed and so we tried to put
[49:15] together leaves we tried to make fashion
[49:17] some sort of garment or some sort of
[49:18] covering
[49:21] but that didn't feel like it was enough
[49:24] when God Called to us we still didn't
[49:26] feel like we were truly covered we had
[49:29] to hide from him
[49:31] and then
[49:32] finally God had to go and he had to cast
[49:36] us out of the garden and when he was
[49:37] casting us out
[49:38] he slew a lamb and he gave us the skins
[49:41] and he fashioned the clothes and he sent
[49:43] us out of the garden
[49:46] and here Cain and Abel they've gotten a
[49:48] little bit older that's maybe it's not
[49:50] with so much wide-eyed wonder anymore
[49:52] they've heard the stories over and over
[49:55] but this time Adam is sharing even more
[49:58] details he's going even more into it to
[50:00] try to let them know
[50:02] what happened
[50:04] and I don't know how far he went I know
[50:06] that sometimes parents maybe we don't
[50:08] want to reveal to our kids exactly how
[50:10] far we went and sin maybe we don't want
[50:12] to reveal exactly how big our mistakes
[50:14] were
[50:16] we don't want to go into every single
[50:18] detail we're going to tell them enough
[50:20] to try to help them understand but we
[50:22] don't want to to do everything I don't
[50:23] know how much Adam
[50:25] told the boys I don't know how far he
[50:28] went into it
[50:31] but yet for
[50:32] every man Man was created to have
[50:35] fellowship with God
[50:37] we were created to worship God and so
[50:40] these boys had that desire within them
[50:43] that they wanted to be back in
[50:45] Fellowship they wanted to be back into
[50:48] that place to worship
[50:50] and so they come down with that desire
[50:53] that they want to make an offering and
[50:55] they want to to worship their creator
[50:58] and they want to go in to this place
[51:02] and so finally they come and they gather
[51:05] together everything to go okay we're
[51:08] going to make our offering
[51:10] and we're going to come into the place
[51:11] and we're going to do it
[51:14] and Adam has told this story
[51:18] countless times
[51:20] Adam and Eve have shared
[51:22] countless times over the years
[51:25] I'm sure they had plenty of other
[51:27] stories as they described the garden but
[51:29] this was the big event
[51:31] I'm sure they talked about what it was
[51:33] like to be in the presence of God and
[51:36] just converse with him and
[51:39] spend time with him in the cool of the
[51:41] evening
[51:43] but anytime you would share that this is
[51:45] what comes down at the end of
[51:48] then we messed up
[51:50] that's why you're not in that presence
[51:51] anymore that's why you're not in that
[51:53] place anymore
[51:55] and so they come down to this place of
[51:58] it's time we're we have this desire we
[52:01] want to worship God we want to have that
[52:03] kind of Fellowship that our parents had
[52:05] but we can't get that close
[52:09] and so we have to come in and we have to
[52:11] offer the sacrifice
[52:14] and try to enter into some measure of
[52:18] fellowship with our creator
[52:20] and so they come in
[52:22] and they both
[52:25] make their offerings
[52:27] Cain
[52:28] gathers everything from the field he's
[52:31] he's the farmer he grabbed gathers
[52:33] everything that he's been growing
[52:34] everything that he's been Gathering to
[52:36] try to put it together to have the most
[52:39] beautiful
[52:40] offering that he can give
[52:43] and Abel here he's the Sheep herder he's
[52:46] the one watching over the flocks
[52:49] and both of them have heard the stories
[52:51] time and time again
[52:53] but what you have is
[52:55] Adam talked about the fact that
[52:58] I tried to make my covering I tried to
[53:00] make it out of the leaves I tried to
[53:03] make it out of
[53:05] the plants
[53:07] but it wasn't enough
[53:10] but yet Cain looked at the beauty of the
[53:12] plants looked at the beauty of
[53:15] everything that was growing it was like
[53:17] this would be the best type of offering
[53:20] this is what I need to bring that's
[53:22] going to bring me back into Fellowship
[53:24] where Abel had focused on the other part
[53:27] of the story gone God had to make
[53:31] bloody skins
[53:32] God had to kill the animal to make the
[53:35] Garment
[53:37] so I need to come in with that same
[53:39] thing
[53:40] I need to come in with that same place
[53:48] brother Brandon says in the sermon
[53:50] spiritual adoption he says look in the
[53:52] Garden of Eden when when Cain brought an
[53:54] offering into worship the same as Abel
[53:56] did he worshiped he paid to the church
[53:58] he sacrificed he done every religious
[54:01] deed brighter better more fitted than
[54:03] what Abel did he built a better altar he
[54:06] made it prettier he put glamor to his
[54:08] worship you see that strain still
[54:10] working amongst the Suns he put glamor
[54:13] to it with the fruits of the field and
[54:15] the big Lillian not only that but he
[54:17] worshiped there is a way that seemeth
[54:19] right unto man but what he did he
[54:22] worshiped through knowledge he worshiped
[54:24] not by Revelation and it's possible get
[54:26] it now listen you can worship through
[54:28] knowledge you can go to church by
[54:30] knowledge but going to church that way
[54:32] is worshiping in vain but when there's
[54:34] something happens down in your heart
[54:36] that makes you love God in such a way
[54:38] you can't stay from church that's the
[54:41] revelation God revealing they had no
[54:43] Bible then they didn't even have paper
[54:45] or slate to work with they had no
[54:47] schools of Education
[54:49] so Abel by Revelation it was revealed to
[54:52] him by God it was not Beauty neither was
[54:55] it the fruits of the field or the apples
[54:56] that had drove them from the Garden of
[54:58] Eden but it was blood and it was
[55:00] revealed to him and he went and he got a
[55:01] lamb by revelation
[55:03] he foresaw the coming of the just lamb
[55:05] and it was revealed to him so he got a
[55:07] lamb
[55:08] and he offered it to God and it was
[55:09] accepted the whole church is built upon
[55:13] spiritual revelation
[55:14] how beautiful
[55:16] and in the sermon the cruelty of sin and
[55:19] the penalty that it costs to rid Sin
[55:21] from our lives
[55:23] and notice now this is a beautiful
[55:24] picture oh my I can see
[55:26] Cain and Abel tooling now or going out
[55:29] to make a sacrifice
[55:31] I believe they built their altar right
[55:33] at the gate at the throne where they
[55:34] could worship notice Here Comes Cain he
[55:37] he probably worked all year toiling
[55:39] doing everything he could to get the
[55:41] very biggest and best apples or pumpkins
[55:44] or whatever he brought it he built him
[55:47] an altar right there by the side of the
[55:48] gate put up all his fruits and the big
[55:51] calla lilies and everything and just
[55:52] laid them on the altar correctly then
[55:54] knelt down and worshiped God
[55:57] now I hope this just soaks way down as
[55:59] it never before till you get it see now
[56:02] notice if God only requires you to go to
[56:04] church Cain was just was as just as able
[56:08] Cain built an altar unto the Lord
[56:10] you say well brother Branham I don't
[56:12] only do that but I make a sacrifice I
[56:14] pay to foreign missions and I them
[56:16] things are all right
[56:18] them is all right but God requires more
[56:20] Cain did that himself see he brought a
[56:23] sacrifice he worshiped the Lord he knelt
[56:25] down and offered praise unto the Lord
[56:27] and said Lord here I am
[56:29] here I am and I've brought you an
[56:31] offering I've built an altar in so many
[56:33] words I'm a member of the church
[56:35] did it hit the bottom look a member of
[56:37] the church I believe in you it'll go to
[56:38] the Bottom now let it soak real deep I'm
[56:41] a Believer in God I've built an altar
[56:42] I've brought a sacrifice
[56:45] and here comes Cain he made his offering
[56:46] he worshiped he went to church he just
[56:48] as good as the next fellow Esau was the
[56:51] same Esau and his character was a better
[56:53] man than Jacob more of a gentleman he
[56:55] loved his father the things that he'd
[56:57] done but God chose Jacob
[56:59] notice now when Abel come to make his
[57:01] offering was quite different when Abel
[57:03] come
[57:05] he didn't work he didn't try to find the
[57:07] biggest church in town to go to he
[57:09] didn't try to find the nicest bunch of
[57:11] people to associate with he just took
[57:13] something that he had and come on
[57:15] he was a shepherd so he just reached
[57:17] over and got a lamb
[57:19] and he tied it with a grapevine or
[57:21] something like that wrapped it around
[57:22] his neck
[57:24] they led him to Calvary
[57:27] he was the lamb said why was he born in
[57:30] a barn well Lambs are not born in houses
[57:31] they are born in Barns
[57:33] and they was led led to the slaughter
[57:35] like a lamb and they led him away
[57:36] leading him up Calvary he was God's lamb
[57:38] from the foundation of the world
[57:41] and there come Abel's Little Lamb
[57:43] and then over here there come God's lamb
[57:46] when I think of it my heart just turns
[57:48] over and over when I think
[57:50] me a poor unworthy ungodly sinner dying
[57:53] without god without Christ in the world
[57:55] without hope and in due season Christ
[57:57] died in my stead the beautiful one and
[57:59] became despised and rejected that I
[58:02] might be accepted and his sighted my
[58:04] Stead
[58:05] oh I just can't get over it I just can't
[58:08] imagine how he would do that for me
[58:11] the Holy Spirit Come hunted me up one
[58:13] day and said he did it for you and I
[58:14] believed him
[58:16] yes sir I accepted him I found it to be
[58:18] so
[58:20] now I can see little Abel watch now I
[58:22] can see Abel go and get this little
[58:23] Grapevine Reach Out get a little male
[58:25] lamb wrapped inside around the neck here
[58:28] he comes dragging him not much Beauty to
[58:30] that is there pulled him up there he got
[58:33] him up a big rock laying there
[58:35] now notice candid probably toiled all
[58:37] year to make the best crop he could
[58:39] thought he could please God by that
[58:41] and many people say I'm going to quit
[58:43] lying I'm going to quit stealing I'll
[58:44] quit smoking I'll turn to a better class
[58:47] of people I'll get in some Society
[58:49] God don't care about your turning a new
[58:51] page he wants you to turn your heart to
[58:54] Christ and let him make out of you
[58:56] now what you can do it's not by Good
[58:58] Works we are saved but by his Mercy are
[59:00] we bought
[59:01] not by works lest any man should boast
[59:04] for we are Gods because it isn't what I
[59:07] am isn't what I do myself it's what
[59:09] Christ and God had did for me and for
[59:11] you
[59:12] notice beautiful type here he comes
[59:14] dragging the little lamb pulling him
[59:15] along
[59:16] I can imagine the little fellow falling
[59:19] probably knew what was near dragging his
[59:21] little feet
[59:22] here comes the little fellow bleeding
[59:25] along and we got him up to the great
[59:27] Rock laid him upon the rock take a piece
[59:30] of sharp Rock
[59:31] laid him like that took him by the back
[59:33] of the head and pulled him like this
[59:35] begin to chop at his little throat
[59:37] The Rock began to beat through his
[59:39] throat
[59:40] on the Rock died the lamb bleeding
[59:42] bladding blood splashing the blood
[59:45] flying all over his little white will
[59:47] became bathed red then with blood
[59:49] God looked down from heaven and said
[59:51] that's it now you got it that's the way
[59:55] the blood spurting from his little veins
[1:00:00] and one last place right now
[1:00:04] when the offering was on the altar God
[1:00:06] refused his intellectual conception of
[1:00:08] God but when he seen Abel by simple
[1:00:10] Faith to believe there was not apples or
[1:00:13] fruits of the field but it was by Blood
[1:00:15] by faith he believed it by Revelation
[1:00:17] from God God Vindicated Abel by
[1:00:21] accepting his sacrifice see
[1:00:24] these boys had heard everything from
[1:00:26] their parents they had heard the exact
[1:00:28] same
[1:00:29] Stories the exact same information
[1:00:33] everything had come out but one received
[1:00:35] the Revelation that it required blood
[1:00:40] one couldn't see that
[1:00:45] what was on the inside the seed was
[1:00:47] being manifest in the fruits that were
[1:00:50] coming forth
[1:00:53] Jesus told a lot of Parables about
[1:00:56] seeds he talked a lot about
[1:00:59] seeds and fruit
[1:01:01] and you can go through
[1:01:03] so many different places in the
[1:01:05] scriptures where this is the focus
[1:01:18] God did not manifested that everything
[1:01:21] that was pretty would be the direction
[1:01:24] that he would go it wasn't in Beauty
[1:01:25] when we look at these original
[1:01:27] sacrifices it wasn't in the beauty of
[1:01:30] the field the nice flowers nice plants
[1:01:32] any of these kinds of things it was in
[1:01:34] the bloody lamb
[1:01:36] that would be the sacrifice that was
[1:01:38] what he would accept that's what was the
[1:01:41] bridge that it would allow you to get
[1:01:42] back into fellowship with him
[1:01:46] in Hebrews chapter 9
[1:01:49] and verse 19 it says for when Moses had
[1:01:52] spoken every precept to all the people
[1:01:53] according to the law he took the blood
[1:01:56] of calves and of goats with water
[1:01:58] and Scarlet wool and hyssop and
[1:02:00] sprinkled both the book and all the
[1:02:02] people
[1:02:03] saying this is the blood of the
[1:02:05] testament which God hath enjoyed unto
[1:02:07] you
[1:02:09] moreover he sprinkled with blood both
[1:02:11] the Tabernacle and all the vessels of
[1:02:13] the ministry
[1:02:14] and almost all things are by the law
[1:02:16] purged with blood
[1:02:18] and without the shedding of blood is no
[1:02:21] remission
[1:02:24] let's go to Leviticus chapter 4.
[1:02:27] and verse 27.
[1:02:32] and if any one of the Common People sin
[1:02:34] through ignorance while he doeth
[1:02:36] somewhat against any of The Commandments
[1:02:38] of the Lord
[1:02:39] concerning things which ought not be
[1:02:41] done and be guilty or if his sin which
[1:02:44] he had sinned come to his knowledge then
[1:02:46] he shall bring his offering a kid of the
[1:02:48] goats a female without blemish for his
[1:02:50] sin which he hath sinned and he shall
[1:02:52] lay his hand upon the head of the sin
[1:02:54] offering
[1:02:55] and slay the sin offering in the place
[1:02:58] of the burnt offering
[1:03:04] God gave the instruction on this is how
[1:03:06] you approach me God gave the instruction
[1:03:08] that this is what you're supposed to do
[1:03:10] and the way that God instructed was not
[1:03:14] the nicest or the most enjoyable way it
[1:03:17] wasn't the way that you would think that
[1:03:20] you wanted to do
[1:03:35] sorry I'm trying to find what I was
[1:03:38] looking for here
[1:03:41] praise the Lord
[1:04:02] praise the Lord
[1:04:04] there it is
[1:04:10] from the church age book The smyrnan
[1:04:11] Church age
[1:04:12] in the Old Testament The Sinner brought
[1:04:14] a lamb he placed his hand on the lamb
[1:04:16] while the priest cut the Lamb's throat
[1:04:19] he felt the bleeding
[1:04:21] and he heard the bleating
[1:04:23] he felt the body stiffened in death
[1:04:26] he saw the smoke of the sprinkled blood
[1:04:28] Ascend to God
[1:04:30] he knew that the lamb had taken his
[1:04:32] place he knew that the Lamb's life had
[1:04:34] been forfeited for his
[1:04:36] but the life of that lamb was animal
[1:04:37] life it could not come back upon the
[1:04:39] sinner making him clean so he left with
[1:04:42] the same desire to sin he would go out
[1:04:43] with sin in his mind and come back and
[1:04:45] offer a sacrifice for the same thing a
[1:04:48] year later
[1:04:54] all too often in this world
[1:04:57] when people
[1:04:59] get gather to worship or gather for
[1:05:01] anything else they're attracted
[1:05:03] to what looks good they're attracted to
[1:05:06] what is well put together what is
[1:05:08] organized well what is decorated well
[1:05:10] what is
[1:05:12] this that the other take your
[1:05:13] description but
[1:05:15] we want to go to the church that looks
[1:05:17] the best we want to go to uh where we've
[1:05:20] got the preacher that can organize
[1:05:22] everything and and preach the best he
[1:05:25] can sound the the smoothest in his
[1:05:28] speech he doesn't stutter he doesn't
[1:05:30] keep going back over the exact same
[1:05:32] thing he was able to run through the
[1:05:34] points and it can be an enjoyable thing
[1:05:36] to listen to he's a good public speakers
[1:05:39] good in these types of situations we
[1:05:42] want to be at the church where
[1:05:44] everyone's going to dress a little bit
[1:05:45] nicer and I'm gonna feel like I fit in
[1:05:48] with the group or maybe they have the
[1:05:50] the best uh worship team up there that
[1:05:53] is able to do all these types of fancy
[1:05:55] presentations and fancy music and do all
[1:05:59] this that's going to allow me not only
[1:06:00] to
[1:06:03] oh feel like I'm worshiping but then
[1:06:05] also to enjoy it because it's just so
[1:06:08] attractive it's so so good looking
[1:06:11] it's the place that that I want to be at
[1:06:19] when we look at
[1:06:21] Jesus talking about these different
[1:06:23] Parables with with the seeds everything
[1:06:26] that he points to is the fact that by
[1:06:29] the fruits you shall know them it's What
[1:06:31] comes forth that's going to allow you to
[1:06:35] know
[1:06:35] what's actually on the inside
[1:06:38] just because someone gathers in
[1:06:41] this church or just because someone
[1:06:43] gathers in the church that looks fancy
[1:06:47] doesn't immediately tell you everything
[1:06:48] about them
[1:06:50] just going on that first step doesn't
[1:06:52] tell you what's going on because the
[1:06:55] seed that's on the inside still has to
[1:06:57] come forth it has to start putting forth
[1:06:59] its fruits for you to know what's going
[1:07:02] on in the inside
[1:07:04] you can have the fruits to go I'm
[1:07:06] willing to sacrifice anything
[1:07:09] and if that means it's messy if that
[1:07:12] means it's bloody if that means I'm
[1:07:13] going this route
[1:07:15] then that's okay
[1:07:17] and you have those with the seed that
[1:07:18] are more like
[1:07:20] I want to do what's comfortable I want
[1:07:22] to do what's enjoyable I want to do what
[1:07:24] I can go into this step and that's going
[1:07:27] to be what the seed manifests
[1:07:32] Matthew chapter 13.
[1:07:38] and verse 24
[1:07:41] says another Parable he put forth unto
[1:07:43] them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:07:44] likened unto a man which sowed good seed
[1:07:47] in his field
[1:07:48] but while men slept his enemy came and
[1:07:50] sowed tares among the wheat and went his
[1:07:53] way
[1:07:54] but when the blade was sprung up and
[1:07:56] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[1:07:57] tares also
[1:07:59] the Servants of the household came and
[1:08:00] said unto him sir dips thou so good seed
[1:08:03] in thy field from Once then hath it
[1:08:06] tears
[1:08:07] he said unto them an enemy hath done
[1:08:09] this the servant said unto him will thou
[1:08:11] then that we go and gather them up
[1:08:13] but he said nay lest while you gather up
[1:08:16] the tares you root up also the wheat
[1:08:17] with them
[1:08:19] let both grow together until the Harvest
[1:08:21] and in the time of harvest I will say to
[1:08:23] the Reapers Gather ye together first the
[1:08:25] tares and bind them in bundles to burn
[1:08:28] them but gather the wheat into my barn
[1:08:33] now I know we've heard it described
[1:08:34] before about how the fact that the wheat
[1:08:37] and the tares look so much like each
[1:08:40] other when they're first growing
[1:08:43] but I had to look it up because I'd
[1:08:45] never actually seen any pictures of it
[1:08:48] I've heard people say that over and over
[1:08:49] but I never looked it up
[1:08:51] it's just keys if you wouldn't mind
[1:08:52] showing
[1:08:55] so here you have wheat and tears
[1:08:59] before the wheat's fully ripe
[1:09:02] now they're labeled so you can tell
[1:09:04] which is which
[1:09:06] but if you were to take away the label
[1:09:10] I don't know anything about plants those
[1:09:12] are going to look like the exact same
[1:09:13] thing to me
[1:09:14] now I'm sure if you get somebody that is
[1:09:16] super experienced and they know
[1:09:18] everything there is they could probably
[1:09:20] Identify some characteristic about them
[1:09:22] let's go okay that's the wheat that's
[1:09:24] the tares
[1:09:26] but the general Layman
[1:09:28] that would go out and work in fields and
[1:09:30] say hey your job is to pull these up
[1:09:32] is not going to be able to tell the
[1:09:34] difference as they go through and go yes
[1:09:36] those are the tares and those are the
[1:09:38] wheat
[1:09:39] at this early stage they look the same
[1:09:43] they don't they're not exhibiting
[1:09:45] everything different they're both going
[1:09:47] with the desire that hey we want to
[1:09:49] worship we want to enter into the
[1:09:51] presence we want to uh do everything
[1:09:53] that we're supposed to we want to
[1:09:55] respond to the word we want to do this
[1:09:57] all the the desires everything you see
[1:09:59] from the outside it looks the same
[1:10:03] it's only as they go further in as they
[1:10:06] come to full maturity
[1:10:09] that you'll begin to see the wheat
[1:10:11] moving into that Golden State moving
[1:10:14] into the state of you're ready to
[1:10:16] harvest
[1:10:18] where the tares just continue to say
[1:10:19] these green weeds that keep going
[1:10:22] there begins to be a transformation over
[1:10:24] time
[1:10:26] but it's not an instant
[1:10:27] it takes time for this seed to manifest
[1:10:30] and for the fruits to show what the seed
[1:10:33] was
[1:10:38] let's go to Isaiah
[1:10:40] chapter one
[1:10:50] Isaiah chapter 1
[1:10:53] and verse 11.
[1:10:57] to what purpose is the multitude of your
[1:10:59] sacrifice unto me saith the Lord
[1:11:01] I am full of burnt offerings of rams and
[1:11:04] the fat of fed beasts and I Delight not
[1:11:07] in the blood of Bullocks or of lambs or
[1:11:09] if he goats when you come to appear
[1:11:11] before me who hath required this at your
[1:11:13] hand to tread my courts
[1:11:15] bring no more vain oblations incense is
[1:11:18] an Abomination unto me the new moons in
[1:11:21] the sabbaths the callings of assemblies
[1:11:23] I cannot away with it it is Iniquity
[1:11:25] even the solemn meeting your new moons
[1:11:28] and your appointed feasts my soul hateth
[1:11:30] they are trouble unto me
[1:11:33] I am weary to Bear them and when you
[1:11:36] spread forth your hands I will hide mine
[1:11:37] eyes from you yea when you make many
[1:11:40] prayers I will not hear your hands are
[1:11:43] full of blood
[1:11:45] Israel had received the instruction that
[1:11:47] this is how you were supposed to worship
[1:11:49] this is how you're supposed to sacrifice
[1:11:52] but over time
[1:11:54] they moved into place of they did it
[1:11:59] because they had to
[1:12:01] they did it because this was the law
[1:12:03] show up once a year put in the sacrifice
[1:12:06] but they weren't actually doing it
[1:12:09] because they wanted to they weren't
[1:12:11] actually doing it because they wanted to
[1:12:12] worship
[1:12:14] once again if you looked at it from the
[1:12:16] outside
[1:12:19] the two seeds looked the same
[1:12:21] you had some from Israel that they were
[1:12:23] coming in in sincerity they came in
[1:12:25] because they wanted
[1:12:27] to be cleansed they wanted to offer the
[1:12:30] sacrifice they wanted to worship God and
[1:12:33] then you had those that simply came
[1:12:34] because it's tradition
[1:12:37] it's the law it's what I have to do if I
[1:12:40] don't do it I'm going to be looked down
[1:12:41] upon by those around me I've got to do
[1:12:43] this in order to be able to fit in with
[1:12:45] all those around me
[1:12:47] so from the outside the seeds looked the
[1:12:49] same from the outside the plants at this
[1:12:52] point manifested they looked the same
[1:12:56] this is obviously the point where God
[1:12:58] could look at the heart he could look at
[1:13:00] what the true fruit was and go
[1:13:02] no that's an Abomination to me
[1:13:05] I won't accept your sacrifice because
[1:13:07] you're not coming with the true desire
[1:13:10] to worship
[1:13:11] it may appear to all those around like
[1:13:14] hey I'm gathering I'm here I'm
[1:13:16] worshiping but God is the one who judges
[1:13:18] the heart God is the one who knows
[1:13:21] what the seed is he knows what fruit is
[1:13:26] being manifested
[1:13:28] it all comes down to what is the actual
[1:13:31] seed that was at the beginning what was
[1:13:33] the actual seed that was planted in you
[1:13:35] from the beginning is it the seed that's
[1:13:37] going to bring forth the wheat or is it
[1:13:39] the seed that's going to bring forth the
[1:13:40] tares
[1:13:42] you had that at the beginning with Cain
[1:13:44] and Abel what was the seed that was
[1:13:46] going to manifest was it the seed that
[1:13:48] was truly going to worship or was the
[1:13:50] seed that wanted to Worship in their way
[1:13:54] here in Israel you had the same
[1:13:56] manifestation happening did you have the
[1:13:57] seed that you truly were coming to
[1:13:59] worship truly coming to sacrifice truly
[1:14:01] coming to repent or was it simply the
[1:14:04] seed of
[1:14:05] I'm going to do what's necessary
[1:14:08] I'm going to do what's expected
[1:14:10] I don't want to be here I'd rather be at
[1:14:12] home
[1:14:13] but I'm going to do this
[1:14:16] and today we find the same thing when
[1:14:17] each of us come into service
[1:14:21] are we coming with that desire that I'm
[1:14:23] coming in willing to go through whatever
[1:14:26] willing to push through whatever Satan
[1:14:28] threw at me this Sunday morning in order
[1:14:30] to get here because I had the desire to
[1:14:33] worship I have the desire to be in his
[1:14:35] presence
[1:14:36] or is it simply to go well if I don't
[1:14:38] show up
[1:14:40] brother Harry might shoot me a text to
[1:14:42] see how I'm doing it where am I at or
[1:14:45] they'll think badly of me because I
[1:14:47] wasn't there or this that the other is
[1:14:49] it actually the desire to be there
[1:14:52] what's the seed that's manifesting
[1:14:54] what's the fruit that's coming forth
[1:15:01] and the sermon the world is falling
[1:15:03] apart
[1:15:04] see Israel first when God told them to
[1:15:06] take a sacrifice and go offer it
[1:15:08] why it was a great thing you can imagine
[1:15:10] a Jew going down the road with a lamb or
[1:15:13] Bullock or whatever it was
[1:15:15] he goes down lays his hand upon the
[1:15:17] sacrifice that's connecting himself
[1:15:19] identity identifying himself with the
[1:15:22] sacrifice when he puts his hand on it
[1:15:24] the priest killed the Beast the little
[1:15:26] lamb whatever it was and as the little
[1:15:28] fellow died kicking and bleeding the
[1:15:31] blood splashed upon his hands
[1:15:33] and the worshiper in sincerity knowed
[1:15:36] that that should be him but the lamb was
[1:15:39] taking his place
[1:15:40] that's what Jehovah acquired because it
[1:15:42] was a type of Christ
[1:15:45] but one time that kept on going on until
[1:15:47] it became a family tradition
[1:15:49] they offered the lamb just the same but
[1:15:52] there was no sincerity about it
[1:15:54] God said they stink in my nostrils and
[1:15:57] today
[1:15:58] years ago we used to find the people in
[1:16:00] deep sincerity and worship and today
[1:16:02] it's become a big glamor of Hollywood
[1:16:04] just some kind of trained music
[1:16:07] women up on the platform with their
[1:16:09] clothes tight enough the skin on the
[1:16:10] outside almost dancing around over the
[1:16:12] platform no sincerity and almost making
[1:16:14] it just an outright ridiculous shame in
[1:16:16] professing Christianity
[1:16:18] I wonder if our offering hasn't become a
[1:16:21] kind of stench in his nose again
[1:16:23] our differences
[1:16:30] and in the true and false Vines he said
[1:16:32] now in the coming out there was two boys
[1:16:34] after Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel
[1:16:36] they were both the children of the
[1:16:37] parent
[1:16:38] now remember both boys tried to find
[1:16:40] favor with God and they made an altar
[1:16:43] now here's the shocking part okay right
[1:16:45] down to the bottom Cain was not an
[1:16:47] unbeliever
[1:16:48] Cain was a believer
[1:16:52] Kane was not an unbeliever Cain was a
[1:16:54] Believer and if a Believer is all that
[1:16:56] God required God was unjust condemning
[1:16:59] Cain and accepting another believer
[1:17:02] Kane was not a communist Kane was not an
[1:17:04] Infidel Cain was a religious man
[1:17:07] and notice he came to worship God
[1:17:10] he was not only a Believer he was a
[1:17:12] worshiper
[1:17:13] not of a false cult he was a worshiper
[1:17:16] of Jehovah God
[1:17:18] I've heard people say all you have to do
[1:17:20] is confess Jesus to be the Son of God
[1:17:22] you're saved Devils have done the same
[1:17:24] thing and they're not saved
[1:17:26] takes more than that the devil said we
[1:17:28] know who you are who you are the Son of
[1:17:30] God the Holy One of Israel publicly
[1:17:32] confessing
[1:17:34] Cain was a Believer and acknowledged the
[1:17:36] Creator not only that but he was a
[1:17:38] worshiper
[1:17:39] now I suppose that the east side of the
[1:17:40] Garden of Eden where the garden lays
[1:17:42] East and Eden perhaps there that was
[1:17:44] where the Great Sword of the Angel was
[1:17:45] flipping back and forth and guarding
[1:17:48] that tree Cain and Abel out there work
[1:17:50] in the fields realize that they come
[1:17:52] from that lovely home they was trying to
[1:17:54] worship God and Cain built himself an
[1:17:56] altar or a church
[1:17:57] and Abel built in one Cain made a
[1:18:00] sacrifice Abel made one Cain nelton
[1:18:03] worship Abel did the same thing now if
[1:18:06] God only requires
[1:18:08] a confession or an altar or church
[1:18:11] membership
[1:18:12] a sacrifice a membership a loyalty to
[1:18:14] the church part of your money your time
[1:18:16] of worship your sincerity for what you
[1:18:17] believe then God being just would have
[1:18:20] to accept Cain
[1:18:25] Amos chapter 5 and verse 21 it says
[1:18:29] I hate I despise your feast days and I
[1:18:32] will not smell in your solemn assemblies
[1:18:35] though you offer me burnt offerings and
[1:18:37] your meat offerings I will not accept
[1:18:39] them neither will I regard the peace
[1:18:41] offering of your fat Beast take thou
[1:18:44] away from me the noise of thy songs for
[1:18:47] I will not hear The Melody of the vials
[1:18:50] but let judgment run down as Waters and
[1:18:52] righteousness as a mighty stream
[1:18:58] first Samuel chapter 15.
[1:19:01] and verse 22.
[1:19:04] and Samuel said hath the Lord is great
[1:19:05] Delight in burnt offerings and
[1:19:07] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:19:10] the Lord
[1:19:11] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:19:13] and to hearken than the fat of rams
[1:19:15] for Rebellion is as the sin of
[1:19:17] Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:19:19] iniquity and idolatry
[1:19:24] and in Revelations chapter 3
[1:19:27] and verse 17.
[1:19:29] because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:19:32] increased with goods and have need of
[1:19:34] nothing
[1:19:35] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[1:19:37] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:19:41] naked
[1:19:48] the seed will manifest the fruit you're
[1:19:52] not going to get a different fruit than
[1:19:53] what the seed was you know we've just
[1:19:55] started our church Garden out here and
[1:19:57] so if I went out and planted tomatoes
[1:20:00] I can't expect cucumbers to grow on that
[1:20:02] vine I can't expect apples to show up I
[1:20:05] can't expect grapes to show up it was
[1:20:08] tomatoes
[1:20:10] unless somebody put the wrong seed in
[1:20:13] the package
[1:20:14] or mislabeled it if I planted tomatoes
[1:20:17] I'm gonna get tomatoes
[1:20:19] if I get something other than tomatoes
[1:20:21] then I know it wasn't a tomato seed that
[1:20:24] went into the ground
[1:20:26] because that's how it manifests
[1:20:29] the fruit at the end tells you what the
[1:20:32] seed was
[1:20:33] the fruit that is shown declares the
[1:20:36] seed
[1:20:38] at one point the plants may look so
[1:20:40] alike that you can't tell them apart but
[1:20:43] fruit at the end always tells you what
[1:20:46] it was at the beginning
[1:20:51] Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 45.
[1:20:56] that ye may be the children of your
[1:20:57] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:21:00] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:21:02] good and he sendeth rain on the just
[1:21:05] and on the unjust
[1:21:15] in Hebrews chapter 6
[1:21:18] and verse 4.
[1:21:21] for it is impossible for those who are
[1:21:22] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:21:24] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:21:27] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[1:21:29] word of God and the powers of the world
[1:21:30] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[1:21:33] them again unto repentance seeing they
[1:21:35] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[1:21:37] afresh and put him to an open shame
[1:21:41] for the Earth which drinketh in the rain
[1:21:43] that cometh offon it and bringeth forth
[1:21:46] herbs meet for them by whom it is
[1:21:48] dressed receive the blessings from God
[1:21:51] but that which bear thorns and Briars is
[1:21:54] rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose
[1:21:56] end is to be burned but beloved we are
[1:21:59] persuaded better things of you and
[1:22:01] things that accompany salvation though
[1:22:03] we thus speak
[1:22:09] brother random tells a story about when
[1:22:11] he was first beginning to uh go into the
[1:22:15] the Pentecostal churches
[1:22:17] and
[1:22:19] he was he had beginning to see the gifts
[1:22:22] of the Spirit breaking out with the
[1:22:24] tongues and with the interpretation
[1:22:27] and
[1:22:29] in one of the meetings he went and he
[1:22:30] talked to two different individuals that
[1:22:33] wanted
[1:22:34] spoken in tongues another one had
[1:22:36] interpreted and he went and spoke to
[1:22:38] these two different ones and
[1:22:41] as he was talking with them he found
[1:22:43] that one of them was
[1:22:46] definitely a Christian man
[1:22:49] lived the life that that he said he did
[1:22:53] while the other one
[1:22:54] did not
[1:22:56] the other one was a hypocrite
[1:22:59] he lived however he wanted
[1:23:01] and
[1:23:03] brother Branham talks about the fact
[1:23:05] that he had a lot of confusion
[1:23:07] from that
[1:23:09] as he walked away going how can the
[1:23:10] spirit be falling on both of these men
[1:23:13] and manifesting this way
[1:23:16] when one has the life to back it up and
[1:23:18] one doesn't
[1:23:22] and he kept going back to uh
[1:23:27] to this scripture
[1:23:34] that I'm going to drop in as he tells
[1:23:37] the story
[1:23:42] and he said I read those words over
[1:23:43] again what we just read in Hebrews
[1:23:47] and when I did that same spirit of God
[1:23:49] came into the room and I beheld a vision
[1:23:51] I saw in the vision a man dressed in the
[1:23:53] purest white who went forth into a
[1:23:55] freshly plowed field and sowed grain
[1:23:57] it was a bright day and the sowing was
[1:23:59] done in the morning but late at night
[1:24:01] after the sower and white had gone a man
[1:24:03] in black cayman stealthily sowed some
[1:24:05] more seed amongst that which the man in
[1:24:08] White had sown
[1:24:10] the days went by the sun and the rain
[1:24:12] blessed the ground and one day there
[1:24:13] appeared the grain how fine it was but a
[1:24:16] day later appeared to tares the wheat
[1:24:19] and the tares grew together they partic
[1:24:21] of the same nourishment out of the same
[1:24:23] soil
[1:24:24] they drink in the same sun and rain
[1:24:27] and one day the skies turned to brass
[1:24:29] and the plants all began to droop and
[1:24:31] die
[1:24:32] I heard the wheat lift their heads and
[1:24:34] cry to God for rain the tares also
[1:24:36] lifted up their voices and pleaded for
[1:24:38] rain then the sky is darkened and the
[1:24:40] rain came and again the wheat now full
[1:24:42] of strength lifted up their voices and
[1:24:44] cried in adoration praise the Lord
[1:24:46] and to my wonderment I heard the revived
[1:24:49] Terrors also look up and say hallelujah
[1:24:52] then I knew the truth of the camp
[1:24:53] meeting
[1:24:54] the parable of the sower and the seed
[1:24:56] the sixth chapter of Hebrews and the
[1:24:58] evident manifestation of spiritual gifts
[1:25:00] in a mixed audience all become
[1:25:02] wonderfully clear
[1:25:03] the sower in white was the low or the so
[1:25:05] or in Black was the devil the world was
[1:25:08] the field the seeds were people elect
[1:25:10] and reprobates both partook of the same
[1:25:12] nourishment water and Sun both prayed
[1:25:14] both received help from God for he
[1:25:17] maketh his son and Reign to fall on both
[1:25:19] the Good and Evil and that they both had
[1:25:22] the same wonderful blessings and both
[1:25:24] had of the same wonderful manifestation
[1:25:28] there was still that one great
[1:25:29] difference
[1:25:30] they were of different seed
[1:25:36] we did everything that we could to
[1:25:37] prepare the
[1:25:39] the church Garden so that you wouldn't
[1:25:41] really have weeds coming up
[1:25:43] and yet you're still going to have weeds
[1:25:45] coming up that you have to deal with
[1:25:47] and
[1:25:48] the weeds and the plants that we've put
[1:25:50] in are getting the same nourishment out
[1:25:52] of the exact same soil we put down
[1:25:55] the exact same
[1:25:57] manure the exact same potting soil the
[1:26:00] exact same everything that you put into
[1:26:02] that garden plot
[1:26:04] both are getting the exact same
[1:26:06] nourishment they're both getting the
[1:26:07] exact same amount of sun
[1:26:10] both are getting the exact same amount
[1:26:12] of water
[1:26:15] they're feeding off the same things
[1:26:18] but that doesn't change what they
[1:26:20] manifest in the end it doesn't change
[1:26:23] the fruit that comes forth
[1:26:28] the seed is what manifests
[1:26:31] they're both fed from the same place
[1:26:32] they're both water from the same place
[1:26:34] they both receive the same sunlight
[1:26:38] but it goes back to what were they at
[1:26:40] the beginning where did they come from
[1:26:42] what was
[1:26:43] how did they originate what was the seed
[1:26:46] because that is going to be the fruit
[1:26:48] that comes forth that is going to be
[1:26:50] what's manifest
[1:27:00] now compare that with Matthew 5 24 again
[1:27:03] notice Jesus said the rain and the Sun
[1:27:05] comes upon the Earth and God sends it to
[1:27:07] prepare the food and the things for the
[1:27:09] people of the earth and the rain is sent
[1:27:11] for the food the herbs but the tares
[1:27:13] weeds being in the field receive the
[1:27:15] same thing the same rain that makes the
[1:27:17] wheat grow is the same rain that makes
[1:27:20] the weeds grow
[1:27:25] let's turn to Luke chapter 8.
[1:27:34] and starting at verse 4.
[1:27:37] and when much people were gathered
[1:27:39] together
[1:27:40] and were come to him out of every city
[1:27:42] he spake by a parable
[1:27:44] A sower went out to sow a seed and as he
[1:27:46] sowed some fell by the wayside and it
[1:27:49] was trodden down and the fowls of the
[1:27:51] air devoured it and some fell upon a
[1:27:53] rock and as soon as it was sprung up it
[1:27:55] withered away because it lacked moisture
[1:27:57] some fell among thorns and the Thorns
[1:28:00] sprang up with it and choked it other
[1:28:02] fell on good ground and sprang up and
[1:28:04] bear fruit and hundredfold
[1:28:06] and when he had said these things he
[1:28:07] cried he the half ears to hear Let Him
[1:28:09] hear
[1:28:10] and his disciples asked him saying what
[1:28:12] might this Parable be and he said unto
[1:28:15] you it is given to know the mysteries of
[1:28:17] the kingdom of God but to others in
[1:28:19] Parables that seeing they might not see
[1:28:20] in hearing they might not understand
[1:28:23] now the parable is this the seed is the
[1:28:25] word of God those by the wayside are
[1:28:27] they that hear then cometh the devil and
[1:28:29] taketh away the word out of their hearts
[1:28:31] lest they should believe and be saved
[1:28:34] they on the Rock are they which when
[1:28:36] they hear receive the word with joy and
[1:28:38] these have no root
[1:28:40] for a while believing in time of
[1:28:42] Temptation Fall Away
[1:28:43] and they which fell among Thorns or they
[1:28:45] which when they have heard go forth and
[1:28:47] are choked with cares and riches and
[1:28:48] pleasures of life and bring no fruit to
[1:28:51] perfection
[1:28:52] but that on the good ground are they
[1:28:54] which in an honest and good heart having
[1:28:56] heard the word keep it and bring forth
[1:28:59] fruit with patience
[1:29:02] in Matthew chapter 12 and verse 33 it
[1:29:04] says either make the tree good and his
[1:29:07] fruit good or else make the tree corrupt
[1:29:10] and his fruit corrupt for the tree is
[1:29:13] known by his fruit
[1:29:26] and we'll go to Galatians chapter 5.
[1:29:32] foreign
[1:29:38] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[1:29:41] ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:29:42] flesh
[1:29:43] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:29:45] and the spirit against the flesh
[1:29:48] and these are contrary the one to the
[1:29:50] other so that you cannot do the things
[1:29:52] that you would
[1:29:54] but if you be led of the spirit year not
[1:29:57] under the law but the fruit of the
[1:29:58] spirit is love joy peace long-suffering
[1:30:02] gentleness goodness faith
[1:30:05] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[1:30:07] which are these adultery fornication
[1:30:09] uncleanliness lasciviousness idolatry
[1:30:12] witchcraft hatred variants emulations
[1:30:14] wrath strife seditions heresies
[1:30:18] envyings murders drunkenness revelings
[1:30:21] and such like of the which I tell you
[1:30:23] before as I have also told you in time
[1:30:26] past that they which do such things
[1:30:28] shall not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:30:36] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:30:39] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[1:30:44] faith
[1:30:45] meekness Temperance against such there
[1:30:49] is no law
[1:30:51] and they that are Christ have crucified
[1:30:53] the flesh with the affections and lust
[1:30:55] if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:30:57] walk in the spirit
[1:30:58] let us not be desirous of vain Glory
[1:31:00] provoking one another and being one
[1:31:03] another
[1:31:08] Paul writes and he tells us
[1:31:10] the fruit that we're going to be looking
[1:31:12] for he tells you this is the fruit that
[1:31:15] will show the seed that is on the inside
[1:31:18] are they going to be manifesting these
[1:31:21] fruits of the spirit
[1:31:23] are they going to be showing love joy
[1:31:26] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[1:31:29] Faith meekness temperance
[1:31:32] is this what's actually manifesting is
[1:31:35] this what's actually coming from the
[1:31:37] inside
[1:31:48] brother random talked about the fact
[1:31:50] that
[1:31:51] in every church you've got three kinds
[1:31:53] of Believers you've got
[1:31:55] the True Believers you've got the
[1:31:58] unbelievers you've got the
[1:32:00] make-believers
[1:32:03] and they all can look the same they can
[1:32:06] all blend in a little bit they can all
[1:32:10] show up to a point
[1:32:13] the same things
[1:32:15] but you begin to wait to see okay what's
[1:32:17] the fruit that's going to be manifesting
[1:32:19] what is going to be coming forth from
[1:32:21] their lives what's going to show the
[1:32:23] seed that's actually on the inside
[1:32:25] are they going to be able to keep
[1:32:26] walking
[1:32:28] forward with a god are they going to be
[1:32:29] able to keep going is their life going
[1:32:31] to be manifesting more and more of these
[1:32:34] fruits of the spirit as the seed is
[1:32:37] growing as the seed is manifesting
[1:32:40] in Ezekiel chapter 9 and verse 4 it says
[1:32:43] and the Lord said unto him go through
[1:32:45] the midst of the city through the midst
[1:32:47] of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[1:32:49] foreheads of the men that sigh and the
[1:32:51] cry for all the Abominations that be
[1:32:53] done in the midst thereof
[1:32:58] this is always the verse that
[1:33:02] makes me question the most or makes me
[1:33:05] examine my life the most
[1:33:08] because all too often we begin to get to
[1:33:10] the point where
[1:33:12] we're used to everything going on
[1:33:15] you know we see the different articles
[1:33:17] talking about
[1:33:18] [Music]
[1:33:18] um
[1:33:20] sin in the nation sin around the world
[1:33:21] all these different things
[1:33:24] and will have conversations about it
[1:33:27] we'll sit around the table and we'll
[1:33:29] talk about how awful it is that this is
[1:33:31] going on or that's going on
[1:33:33] but when we go back to this
[1:33:36] can we say that we are spending time
[1:33:38] sighing and crying before the Lord
[1:33:41] over the Abominations that are taking
[1:33:43] place
[1:33:44] is this the fruit that we're manifesting
[1:33:46] are we entering that far into it
[1:33:49] where we're going no this is not my home
[1:33:51] I'm Desiring for a place on the other
[1:33:54] side
[1:33:56] or have we become so accustomed to it
[1:33:59] that as long as it hasn't entered my own
[1:34:01] little house or my own little church or
[1:34:04] my own little area
[1:34:07] it's okay
[1:34:12] when I look at my own life and I'm
[1:34:13] looking at the fruit
[1:34:16] I have to end up praying going Lord I
[1:34:18] need help to get this place
[1:34:20] is this the one I'm not trying to preach
[1:34:22] in any of you this is and me as much as
[1:34:23] anyone to go Lord I need to be at the
[1:34:27] plate where it's so desperate in my
[1:34:29] heart that when I see the new article
[1:34:31] come out about this law being passed or
[1:34:34] this going on or that going on that it's
[1:34:37] not just a
[1:34:39] well
[1:34:40] I knew it was going to keep getting
[1:34:41] worse but instead it's where you're
[1:34:44] driven to your knees going
[1:34:45] Lord this can't be going on
[1:34:48] this isn't right
[1:34:51] how can you stand to let things continue
[1:34:54] when this is going on around the Earth
[1:34:58] when this is going on around the nation
[1:35:00] when this is going around around my
[1:35:02] state when this is going on around my
[1:35:04] city
[1:35:06] when this is going on around my
[1:35:08] neighborhood when it's going on around
[1:35:10] you can keep taking it as tight or as
[1:35:12] big as you want
[1:35:15] but how much is it that we've become
[1:35:17] used to it and as long as it's not
[1:35:20] directly affecting us
[1:35:24] I can read the article newspaper set the
[1:35:27] newspaper decide and not think of it
[1:35:28] again
[1:35:29] I can keep walking away
[1:35:33] am I manifesting all the fruit that I'm
[1:35:35] supposed to
[1:35:39] I didn't
[1:35:40] grab the scripture but the the scripture
[1:35:42] that talks about that if a tree is not
[1:35:45] producing fruit
[1:35:47] they'll take it and beat the roots
[1:35:51] to see if that'll get the the fruit to
[1:35:53] come and if if that doesn't do it
[1:35:56] if beating the roots and then putting
[1:35:58] the fertilizer into anything if it
[1:36:00] doesn't bring forth fruit at that point
[1:36:02] then we'll chop it down
[1:36:07] if I'm not manifesting all the fruits if
[1:36:09] I'm not able to look at things and go
[1:36:12] yes I'm part of that group that I'm
[1:36:14] sighing and crying when I look at the
[1:36:17] evil around me
[1:36:21] maybe there's some beatings in my future
[1:36:24] to try to get that fruit to manifest
[1:36:27] to try to get us that place and maybe if
[1:36:30] I'm truly sincere about it maybe that's
[1:36:33] what I have to be asking for
[1:36:35] going Lord I if it means beating crate
[1:36:39] fertilizing feeding me trying to get me
[1:36:41] to grow to a new state yes Lord this is
[1:36:44] what I need because this is the fruit
[1:36:46] that you're asking for this is the fruit
[1:36:48] that you're holding up
[1:36:50] it goes back all the way from the
[1:36:52] beginning of what was the fruit that was
[1:36:53] manifesting when we go back to original
[1:36:55] sacrifice and now today what are the
[1:36:58] fruits that we're supposed to be
[1:36:59] manifesting
[1:37:00] what are we supposed to be showing up to
[1:37:02] those around are we becoming so used to
[1:37:05] our environment
[1:37:08] that our fruits are not showing the way
[1:37:10] they should
[1:37:12] if someone is looking at our lives
[1:37:15] can they tell the seed that was on the
[1:37:16] inside can they tell what the beginning
[1:37:18] is or have we not grown far enough for
[1:37:20] the fruits to truly manifest
[1:37:25] as the musicians come
[1:37:29] Luke chapter 6 and verse 43.
[1:37:34] for a good tree bringeth forth not
[1:37:35] corrupt fruit
[1:37:37] neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth
[1:37:39] good fruit
[1:37:40] for every tree is known by his own fruit
[1:37:44] for of thorns men do not gather figs nor
[1:37:47] of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes
[1:37:51] a good man out of the good Treasure of
[1:37:53] his heart bringeth forth that which is
[1:37:55] good
[1:37:56] an evil man out of the evil Treasure of
[1:37:58] his heart bringeth forth that which is
[1:37:59] evil
[1:38:00] for of the abundance of the heart
[1:38:02] his mouth speaketh
[1:38:08] God's place to seed
[1:38:11] in each one of us
[1:38:15] but that seed has to manifest the fruits
[1:38:18] have to begin to come forth
[1:38:21] the fruits are what lets you know what
[1:38:23] the seed is
[1:38:24] the fruits are what confirm what the
[1:38:26] seed is
[1:38:27] yes there are people that study botany
[1:38:29] that they can take a seed and they can
[1:38:31] look at just the seed and tell you this
[1:38:33] is the seed for this item
[1:38:35] there are a few things that maybe I
[1:38:37] could look at and go yeah that's an
[1:38:38] apple seed I know what that is
[1:38:40] that's this kind of seed most seeds you
[1:38:43] could put them in front of me and I have
[1:38:44] no idea
[1:38:46] but when they start to grow and they
[1:38:48] start to manifest it I can look hey
[1:38:50] that was a rose bush seed
[1:38:53] that one was a tomato plant seed that
[1:38:56] one was a this that one was a that
[1:38:59] because now there's fruits and I
[1:39:01] recognize the fruits
[1:39:06] God is calling us
[1:39:08] to manifest fruits
[1:39:11] he's calling us manifest the fruits of
[1:39:13] the spirit he's calling us to
[1:39:16] be seen of the world around
[1:39:20] to be living a life that people can
[1:39:22] recognize to be manifesting fruits that
[1:39:25] people can look at and go that's
[1:39:26] different
[1:39:28] that's not the Briars and brambles that
[1:39:31] we're used to seeing all around the
[1:39:32] world
[1:39:34] that's actually some wheat beginning to
[1:39:36] grow up
[1:39:37] that's actually some
[1:39:40] take your pick of what plants you want
[1:39:42] to identify with
[1:39:43] we'll stick with wheat because that's
[1:39:44] the type but that is the wheat well
[1:39:47] everything else I can see there brambles
[1:39:49] their tears their weeds of every type
[1:39:52] but look there's some
[1:39:54] weed that's there's actually some wheat
[1:39:56] that's growing up
[1:39:57] and it's maturing
[1:39:59] it's maturing Under The Sun It's
[1:40:01] maturing under the word
[1:40:05] and it just keeps getting more and more
[1:40:08] different
[1:40:09] where it went from the stage where they
[1:40:11] could be right beside each other
[1:40:13] and almost
[1:40:14] unrecognizable the difference
[1:40:17] the closer and closer it gets to harvest
[1:40:19] the more and more different they look
[1:40:21] the more and more they stand out the
[1:40:23] more and more the fruit stands out is
[1:40:26] this is not tares this is not
[1:40:30] just some random seed that was sown this
[1:40:33] is the crop that we're here to harvest
[1:40:36] this is what we're supposed to be
[1:40:38] manifesting
[1:40:40] so what we're supposed to manifest in
[1:40:42] our worship it's supposed to what we're
[1:40:43] supposed to manifest in our attitude
[1:40:45] when we're coming to the house of God
[1:40:48] and our attitude as we're out at the
[1:40:50] workplace and the way that we respond to
[1:40:53] each other way that we think of our
[1:40:54] brothers and sisters the way that we
[1:40:56] care for them and pray for them the way
[1:40:58] that we think about the evil that's
[1:40:59] going on around us
[1:41:02] all of those are the fruits that are
[1:41:03] supposed to be manifesting
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:09] each one of you has to examine your own
[1:41:11] life for those fruits
[1:41:14] that's not my job to check up on you
[1:41:17] I have to do that for myself
[1:41:20] I'm the one that I have to keep taking
[1:41:22] my life back to that verse and going am
[1:41:24] I at the point where I'm sighing and
[1:41:26] crying am I at the point where I'm
[1:41:28] manifesting
[1:41:30] the love the joy the peace the long
[1:41:32] suffering am I at the point where I am
[1:41:34] living this and I can say yes those
[1:41:37] fruits are showing like they're supposed
[1:41:38] to
[1:41:44] Lord Jesus we come before you and Lord
[1:41:49] I know this has been
[1:41:51] chopped up and and all over the place
[1:41:53] Lord
[1:41:58] this is just what
[1:42:01] you've had me thinking about
[1:42:04] for the last little while Lord and
[1:42:07] Lord I pray that something that was said
[1:42:09] would would sink into each heart here
[1:42:13] Lord that they would be able to walk
[1:42:14] away with
[1:42:15] just that little
[1:42:17] the little nugget that was meant for
[1:42:18] them Lord
[1:42:21] Lord if there was anything that I that I
[1:42:23] said wrong Lord Jesus I pray that you
[1:42:25] would forgive me of it Lord Jesus if
[1:42:27] there was anything that
[1:42:28] that I missed Lord I pray that you would
[1:42:31] take control and that you would Minister
[1:42:33] to to the heart through your Holy Spirit
[1:42:35] Lord to give them what it was that I
[1:42:37] didn't say Lord Jesus
[1:42:44] Lord when we look at the
[1:42:47] the world around us we know that time
[1:42:49] can't be going much longer Lord
[1:42:54] and we have to be manifesting the fruits
[1:42:57] Lord we have to be
[1:42:59] showing the fruits that
[1:43:01] point back to the seed that was placed
[1:43:04] there at the beginning Lord
[1:43:08] if I'm not manifesting the right things
[1:43:10] Lord then Lord
[1:43:12] do the work that's needed
[1:43:17] prune what needs to be pruned away Lord
[1:43:20] [Music]
[1:43:21] fertilize beat the roots whatever is
[1:43:24] needed Lord that that
[1:43:25] fruit would begin to manifest Lord Jesus

[1:43:34] we thank you for your presence Lord we

[1:43:39] caring enough to to come down and
