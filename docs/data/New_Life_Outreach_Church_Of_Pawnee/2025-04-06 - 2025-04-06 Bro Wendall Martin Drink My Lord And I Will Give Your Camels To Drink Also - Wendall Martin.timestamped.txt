[0:00] Now you get on your
[0:06] [Music]
[0:09] soul. So get up and praise your
[0:15] Lord. So
[0:19] I praise you again and again.
[0:24] [Music]
[0:35] how and I know it's not
[0:38] much nothing else fit for a
[0:41] [Music]
[0:42] king except for a heart singing
[0:46] hallelujah.
[0:50] [Music]
[0:58] Hallelujah. It's your
[1:00] breath in our
[1:03] lungs, so we pour out our praise. Pour
[1:08] out our praise. It's your

[1:19] only. Great are you, Lord. Great are
[1:24] you, Lord. Sing that again. It's your
[1:27] breath. It's your
[1:30] breath in our
[1:32] lungs. So we pour out our praise. Pour
[1:37] out our praise. It's your
[1:40] breath in our
[1:42] lungs. So we pour out our praise to you,
[1:48] [Music]
[1:51] holy. Great are you,
[1:57] Lord.
[1:59] I
[2:02] exalt thee.
[2:04] Can we do that this morning? Oh, I
[2:11] exalt
[2:15] thee. Oh,
[2:17] I
[2:20] exalt
[2:24] thee,
[2:26] oh Lord.
[2:32] [Music]
[2:33] Oh,

[2:40] thee. Thank you, Lord.
[2:43] I
[2:45] exalt
[2:49] thee. Oh, I
[2:54] exalt
[2:55] [Music]
[2:58] thee,
[3:00] oh Lord.
[3:04] [Music]
[3:05] Have you've come to exalt him this
[3:08] morning? Yes, Lord. Yes,
[3:13] Lord. Like to go to prayer if we may
[3:16] here this morning. Don't have any
[3:17] written request, but we do have one for
[3:20] brother
[3:21] Austin. Stout or he's not feeling well.
[3:25] I think it could be nerves. It could be
[3:27] the flu. I'm not sure. He's a week from
[3:28] his wedding. So, let's just remember
[3:31] brother Austin in our prayer here this
[3:33] morning. And I don't see grandpa or
[3:36] grandma here with us. Let's remember
[3:37] them. And they're in Ohio. Okay. Let's
[3:41] still remember them in our prayers. And
[3:44] anyone else that's not with us here
[3:46] tonight, I'm going to have this morning
[3:48] ask brother Nathaniel put them on the
[3:50] spot if you wouldn't mind coming and
[3:52] leading us in prayer. And if you have a
[3:54] need upon your heart, just make it known
[3:56] by the lifting of your hand.
[4:01] Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, thank
[4:04] you for allowing us to come out here
[4:06] tonight and just giving us another
[4:08] opportunity to praise your name. Jesus,
[4:10] I pray that you'd come tonight and just
[4:13] bless every need. Jesus, we know you're
[4:16] still the healer. We know you're still
[4:18] more than able to grant every need.
[4:20] Jesus, we pray that you just come in the
[4:22] service this morning. Jesus, just bless
[4:25] the minister as he preaches. Jesus, I
[4:28] pray that you just speech to each one of
[4:31] us. Jesus, I pray that you just be in
[4:34] the remainder of the service, being in
[4:35] everything that is said and done. We
[4:37] thank you for everything in Jesus
[4:38] Christ's name. Amen.
[4:42] Do you love him here this morning? Amen.
[4:44] As we sing this, just step out in the
[4:46] aisles and greet one another. Oh,
[4:48] welcome, Holy Spirit.
[4:53] Oh, we are in your
[4:58] presence. Oh, fill us with your
[5:03] power. Yes, Lord. Live inside of
[5:07] [Music]
[5:09] me. Oh,
[5:15] well, we are in your
[5:19] presence. Thank you, Lord. Fill us with
[5:23] your
[5:26] power. Live inside of me. You're the
[5:30] living water and you're the living
[5:34] water.
[5:38] Everflowing
[5:42] fountain, comforter and
[5:46] counelor, take complete
[5:49] [Laughter]
[5:51] control. Oh, welcome Holy
[5:56] Spirit. Oh, we are in your
[6:01] presence. Thank you, Lord. Fill us with
[6:04] your power.
[6:08] Word. Live inside of me. Welcome Holy
[6:12] Spirit. Oh, welcome Holy
[6:17] Spirit. We are
[6:20] in
[6:22] presence. Yes, we are. Fill us with your
[6:27] [Music]
[6:28] power. Live inside of me. You're the
[6:32] living waters and you're the living
[6:37] [Music]
[6:39] water. Everflowing
[6:42] [Music]
[6:42] [Applause]
[6:44] fountain, comforter and
[6:49] counelor, take complete
[6:52] [Laughter]
[6:52] [Music]
[6:54] control. Oh, welcome Holy Spirit.
[7:01] We are in your
[7:07] presence. Thank you, Lord. Yes. Oh, live
[7:11] inside of
[7:13] [Music]
[7:16] me. Oh, there's a river of life flowing
[7:21] out of
[7:23] me. It makes the lame to walk and the
[7:27] blind to see.
[7:30] It opens prison doors, sets the captives
[7:35] free. Oh, there's a river of life
[7:39] flowing now. Can we go up a key? Sing
[7:42] that again. There's a river of life
[7:45] flowing out of
[7:48] me. It makes the lame to walk and the
[7:52] blind to see.
[7:55] It opens prison doors, sets the captives
[8:01] free. Oh, there's a river of life
[8:04] flowing out of me. Spring up a
[8:09] well within my
[8:12] soul. Spring up a
[8:15] well and make me whole.
[8:20] Spring up a
[8:22] well and give to
[8:25] me that life. Sing it now as our ushers
[8:29] come
[8:31] binding. Oh, there's a river of life
[8:36] flowing out of
[8:38] me. It makes the lame to walk and the
[8:42] blind to see. It opens prison door, sets
[8:48] the captives free. Oh, there's a river
[8:53] of life flowing out of
[9:03] me. Lord Jesus, we just come into your
[9:06] presence once more, Lord. Lord, we just
[9:08] lift before you these tithes and
[9:10] offerings, Lord. We pray that you would
[9:11] just bless those that are able to give
[9:13] and those that aren't, Lord. And be used
[9:15] for your kingdom. Lord, we just commit
[9:17] the remainder of the service into your
[9:19] hands. And Lord Jesus Christ, you pray.
[9:26] Amen. He's God at the pull. He's God out
[9:31] the back door. He's God in the eightman
[9:35] corner. He's God all over the floor. I
[9:39] know God is God. And God don't ever
[9:44] change. I know God is God and Jesus is
[9:50] his
[9:51] name. Well, he's God when the lightning
[9:55] flashes. He's God when the thunder
[9:58] rolls. He's God way up in heaven. He's
[10:02] God down in my soul. And I know God is
[10:06] God. Yes, he is. God don't ever change.
[10:10] I know God is God and Jesus is his
[10:17] name. Oh, he's God if you love him. He's
[10:22] God if you don't. He's God when you
[10:26] serve him. He's God when you won't. I
[10:30] know God is God and God don't ever
[10:35] change. I know God is God and Jesus is
[10:41] his
[10:42] name. He's the God that healed the
[10:46] leopard. He's the God that raised the
[10:49] dead. You can stand up on his promises.
[10:53] He'll do just what he said. I know God
[10:57] is God and God don't. Sister Keys, do
[11:01] you have a song this morning? God is God
[11:05] and Jesus is his
[11:08] name. Oh, he's God in the Father. He's
[11:13] God in the Son. He's God in the Holy
[11:17] Spirit. And I know these three are one.
[11:21] I know God is God and God don't ever
[11:26] change. I know God is God and Jesus is
[11:32] his
[11:33] name. Well, he's God of the first. He's
[11:38] God of the last. He's God of my future.
[11:44] He's still God of my past. I know God is
[11:49] God and God don't ever change. I know
[11:53] God is God. One more. And Jesus is his
[11:59] name. Well, he's
[12:06] gone. Can we try that again? I'm not
[12:08] sure which verse. Oh, come out of her,
[12:11] my people. The prophet has
[12:14] declared you must believe this message
[12:18] for Christ to meet you there. And I know
[12:22] God. Thank you, Lord.
[12:25] And God don't ever change. I know God is
[12:29] God and Jesus is his
[12:36] name. Lord, I give you my
[12:40] heart. I give you my
[12:44] soul. Yes, Lord. I live for you alone.
[12:52] Every breath that I
[12:55] take, every moment I'm
[13:00] awake, Lord, have your
[13:04] way in
[13:07] me. Yes, Lord. God bless you. You may be
[13:09] seated.

[13:41] [Music]
[13:49] The road before
[13:53] you vanished and gone.
[13:58] No way
[14:01] over. No way around it.
[14:06] and you're
[14:08] wondering how to go
[14:15] on your
[14:18] eyes. God has given you a promise.
[14:24] Just ask what you will believe and be
[14:27] still and watch him move.
[14:34] Faith can move that
[14:38] mountain in Jesus name.
[14:42] [Music]
[14:46] Speak his power again.
[14:55] into the
[14:58] sea. Faith can move your mountain if you
[15:04] only believe.
[15:13] You
[15:14] [Music]
[15:20] remember Jesus
[15:23] commanded have faith in
[15:27] God and he would give
[15:32] power to say to that
[15:35] [Music]
[15:36] mountain be thou removed.
[15:40] moved and it would be
[15:44] done.
[15:48] Therefore, whatsoever you
[15:53] desire, just ask him
[15:56] believing and it shall be yours.
[16:03] Faith can move that mountain if you ask
[16:07] in Jesus name.
[16:11] Speak the word belie.
[16:16] [Music]
[16:28] Faith can move your mountain if you only
[16:33] believe.
[16:35] [Music]
[16:36] Faith can move your mountain. If you ask
[16:40] in Jesus name,
[16:44] speak the word
[16:50] belie and watch that mountain
[16:56] be cast into to the
[16:59] sea. Faith can move your mountain if you
[17:05] only believe.
[17:08] Faith can move your mountain if you
[17:14] only believe.
[17:21] Amen. So glad we have that promise here
[17:24] this morning. Amen.
[17:26] God bless you. Now, if you could stand
[17:27] to your feet. Sister Amy, you think you
[17:30] and Mary can do that song that you were
[17:32] going to do with
[17:33] Adam right before he passed. I don't
[17:35] know if y'all ever sing that, but if
[17:39] y'all could look into that, can we do
[17:40] this? God's not dead. He's alive. And

[24:40] hungry.
[24:42] I need you here this morning. I don't
[24:44] know. Maybe that's my cry. That's That
[24:46] song's been on my heart the last few
[24:49] days. Lord, I need a feeling of you here
[24:52] this morning. How about it? How can I
[24:53] see a show of hands and say, "Lord, I I
[24:56] need a feeling of you here this
[24:58] morning." Can we sing this as the man of
[25:00] God comes? Can we go to F and let's try
[25:03] this? I have what you
[25:07] need, but you keep on searching.
[25:10] [Music]
[25:13] I've done all the
[25:15] work, but you keep on
[25:20] working when you're riding on empty. Oh
[25:24] my. And you can find a
[25:28] remedy. Just come to the well.
[25:33] You can spend your whole
[25:36] life on Jesus, chasing what's
[25:41] missing, but that empty
[25:44] inside just ain't going to
[25:49] listen. When nothing can
[25:53] satisfy and the world leaves you high
[25:56] and
[25:57] dry, just come to the well. Oh my. And
[26:03] all who
[26:04] thirst will thirst no
[26:08] more. Yes. And all who
[26:12] search will
[26:14] find what their souls long for. The
[26:19] world may
[26:21] try, but it can never feel.
[26:27] Just leave it all
[26:30] behind and run to the
[26:34] well. So bring me your heart this
[26:38] morning. No matter how
[26:42] broken, come just as you are. When the
[26:46] last prayer is
[26:50] spoken, just rest in my arms a while.
[26:55] You'll feel the change, my
[26:58] child, when you've come to the
[27:02] well. Oh, now that you're full, I love
[27:06] this. With love beyond
[27:10] measure, your joy is going to
[27:13] flow like a stream in the
[27:18] desert. Oh, soon all the world will see.
[27:21] Oh my, that living water is found in
[27:25] me cuz you came to the well. All who
[27:30] thirst and all who thirst.
[27:34] Yes, Lord.
[27:38] Thank you, Lord.
[27:41] Will
[27:42] find what their souls long for. The
[27:47] world may
[27:49] try but it can never
[27:53] fail. Just leave it all
[27:57] behind. Sing that again now as the man
[28:00] of God
[28:01] comes and all.

[31:38] right bride for for Isaac. And so we're
[31:41] going to start here at the 11th verse.
[31:43] And he made his camels to kneel down
[31:46] without the city by the well of water at
[31:49] the time of the evening, even the time
[31:52] that women go out to draw water. And he
[31:56] said, Lord, God of my master
[31:59] Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed
[32:02] this day, and show kindness unto my
[32:05] master Abraham.
[32:07] Behold, I stand here by the well of
[32:10] water, and the daughters of the men of
[32:12] the city come out
[32:15] uh and draw water. Let it come to pass
[32:19] that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let
[32:24] down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I
[32:26] may drink, and she shall say, drink, and
[32:30] I will give thy camels drink also.
[32:34] Let the same be she that shall that thou
[32:38] has appointed for thy servant Isaac. And
[32:40] thereby shall I know that thou hast
[32:42] showed kindness unto my master. And it
[32:45] came to pass before he had done speaking
[32:48] that behold Rebecca came out and she was
[32:51] born to Bethul the son of Milka the wife
[32:54] of Noah Abraham's brother with her
[32:57] picture upon her shoulder. And the dames
[33:00] was very fair to look upon, a virgin,
[33:02] neither had known uh any man known her.
[33:06] And she went down to the well and filled
[33:09] her pitcher, and came up. And the
[33:11] servant ran to meet her and said, "Let
[33:13] me, I pray thee, drink a little water of
[33:15] thy pitcher." And she said, "Drink, my
[33:18] lord." And she hasted and let down her
[33:22] pitcher upon her hand and gave him
[33:25] drink. And when she had done given him
[33:28] drink, she said, I will draw water for
[33:31] thy camels also, until they have done
[33:34] drinking. And she hasted and emptied her
[33:37] picture into the trough, and ran again
[33:40] unto the well to draw water, and drew
[33:42] for all his camels. And the man
[33:45] wondering at her, held his peace, to
[33:48] whether the Lord had made his journey
[33:51] prosperous or not. And it came to pass
[33:54] as the camels had done drinking that the
[33:57] man took a golden earring of half a
[33:59] shekele weight and two brass bracelets
[34:02] for her hands and 10 shekels weight of
[34:07] gold and said, "Whose daughter art thou?
[34:10] Tell me, I pray thee, is there room in
[34:12] thy father's house for us to lodge in?"
[34:15] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Lord
[34:18] Jesus, we want to thank you for Lord the
[34:22] well of water that you have you have
[34:26] given us to drink from. And Father, we
[34:29] thank you for your many blessings, Lord,
[34:33] that there's Lord the the river of life
[34:37] that gives us everything that we have
[34:40] need of. And Lord, if there's anything
[34:43] that we want to do this this morning is
[34:45] to drink from your well. But Lord, we
[34:48] also want to give you a drink. And I
[34:51] pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would be
[34:54] with us here in the service. That you
[34:56] would be Lord real to our hearts and
[34:59] anoint us Lord for your glory. I pray,
[35:02] Father, that you will be with our uh our
[35:07] brother Austin, Lord, as he's not
[35:10] feeling well this morning. And Father,
[35:13] he's got a busy week and going to be
[35:15] getting married this week, Lord. And
[35:18] we're just asking that you would be with
[35:20] him today and strengthen him and heal
[35:23] him, Lord. Just ask Lord that you would
[35:26] just have your perfect will and your
[35:28] perfect way in this service in the name
[35:31] of the Lord Jesus. Can the church say
[35:34] amen? And amen. God bless you. You can
[35:37] be seated here this
[35:39] morning. I want to
[35:45] um uh minister this this morning a
[35:49] little bit on Amen. Uh the title I guess
[35:52] would be uh drink my lord and I will
[35:57] give thy co camels drink
[36:00] also. And u I know that's a that's a
[36:03] strange title
[36:05] um but I want to speak on receiving from
[36:09] the Lord and being putting ourselves in
[36:12] a position to receive from the Lord. And
[36:16] I I think it's it's important that we
[36:19] that we uh understand that when God
[36:23] comes in a in in a special way, when his
[36:26] presence is with us, Amen. there is
[36:30] there is an act of worship that we must
[36:35] uh respond with. Amen. And so as we go
[36:38] through the service this morning, we're
[36:39] going to be dealing with actions and
[36:41] reactions. We're going to be talking
[36:44] about how Amen. how the
[36:47] [Music]
[36:49] the angel of the Lord is there at the
[36:52] well. Eleazar is there at the well.
[36:55] Amen. But there there and but there is
[36:58] something that you are required to do to
[37:01] receive from the Lord. And so Amen. And
[37:05] and I believe that that requires a heart
[37:09] of reverence, a a sincere heart of
[37:12] worship. It requires a reverential
[37:15] attitude toward God. In other words, we
[37:18] have got to understand that God is much
[37:22] higher than any of us. And that if we
[37:25] want to receive something of the Lord,
[37:28] there is a an approach. There is a way
[37:31] that we must take in order to receive
[37:34] from the Lord. You don't just walk up to
[37:37] the Lord. Amen. And and just expect to
[37:40] receive. Okay, I'm here at the church.
[37:42] Amen. Um I'm doing what I supposed to
[37:45] do. But there is a preparation of your
[37:48] heart if you want to get the attention
[37:51] of the Lord. Amen. And and so this is
[37:55] this is so important because you are
[37:58] nothing. And I think that's the first
[38:00] thing we've got to we've got to
[38:02] understand. Humanity, Amen, is as the
[38:05] dust that that is that that is here on
[38:08] this podium here this morning. You are
[38:10] nothing but dust. you you have nothing
[38:14] you can offer God. There is nothing
[38:16] within your ability. Amen. I even if you
[38:20] were the the most righteous man around,
[38:23] you add nothing to God. You give you
[38:26] bring nothing to the table. Amen. And
[38:29] and and you've got to understand that
[38:32] you are nothing, but he is everything.
[38:38] And I need him more than he needs me. He
[38:42] was in
[38:44] existence millions and trillions of
[38:46] years before I ever came around. Can you
[38:49] say amen? But yet God in his goodness
[38:53] and in his fornowledge, he
[38:56] forsaw you and me and brought you and me
[39:00] into his covenant. Amen. So that we
[39:04] could work together. Now, we should
[39:06] never that doesn't mean that Amen. Uh uh
[39:09] that we'll ever get above God. We'll
[39:12] never get above God. Amen. We can only
[39:15] work with God. And the only way that we
[39:18] will ever Amen. be used of God or
[39:21] receive anything of the Lord is when our
[39:24] heart is right. Amen. With him and we
[39:28] understand and put him where he belongs
[39:32] and we stay where we belong.
[39:34] Well, how many believes that's all
[39:36] right? Amen. Now, Psalms 22 and3. Amen.
[39:40] It says, "Thou art holy." Amen. Thou art
[39:45] holy. Uh, oh, thou that inhabitest the
[39:50] praises of of Israel. So, so now we we
[39:53] want to understand that God is holy.
[39:56] Jesus Jesus when they said, "Teach us
[39:58] how to pray," Jesus said, "Amen. Pray
[40:01] after this manner. Our Father, which art
[40:04] in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Set
[40:08] apart is thy name. You are exalted. I am
[40:13] the one on my knees bowing and praying
[40:16] unto the God of all power. Amen. So, so
[40:21] hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
[40:26] Thy will be done on earth as it already
[40:30] is in heaven. Amen. So God has already
[40:34] got a plan for your life. God's got a
[40:37] plan for my life. Amen. There is none of
[40:40] us that is exempt. Amen. God's got a
[40:43] plan. So when we pray, when we come
[40:46] before God, we are our our heart is you
[40:50] are the potter. I am I need you. You've
[40:56] already got a will. You've already got a
[40:59] plan. Now Lord, somehow I am praying
[41:03] that you'll help me to surrender my
[41:06] heart, my thought, my life, surrender my
[41:11] pride to you so that I can be a vessel
[41:15] for your will to be fulfilled in. You've
[41:19] already got a will for me. You've
[41:21] already got a desire for me. I know my
[41:24] name is already in your book. Now, Lord,
[41:28] I'm asking that you take this Amen. this
[41:31] this body and this brain of cream cheese
[41:34] and Amen. somehow or another get I'm
[41:39] needing you to influence my life so that
[41:43] I can do your will.
[41:47] God's got a plan for you. He's got a
[41:50] plan for every one of us. Amen. And so
[41:53] the the greatest thing, thou art my
[41:56] father. Amen. Our father which art in
[41:59] heaven, hallowed. Amen. Be thy name set
[42:02] apart holy. Amen. You are the one that I
[42:08] look to and I'm asking for your will to
[42:11] be done in my life. Now, now the next
[42:14] thing when he said, "Thou art holy and
[42:17] thou inhabitest the praises." I think
[42:21] when we come to the house of God or when
[42:23] we come to prayer, Amen. our our desire,
[42:27] our our heart should be that of worship.
[42:31] Amen. Worshiping the Lord. Amen. Praise
[42:34] thinking the Lord for what he's done for
[42:36] me. Lord, I should be dead, but here I
[42:39] am on my knees thanking you. Lord, I I
[42:43] should be in jail, but here I am. Amen.
[42:46] sitting in church again and you've been
[42:49] good to me. I I I should be a divorced
[42:53] man. Amen. Or woman, but yet you've been
[42:56] good to me. I I should be My children
[43:00] should be lost. Amen. But here they are
[43:03] in the church. Well, can you say amen?
[43:06] Hallelujah. I think we've got a lot to
[43:08] be thankful for because God has been
[43:13] good to you. Amen. You see now, you're
[43:16] never going to have that as long as
[43:18] you're looking at God as if he's your
[43:21] servant. Amen. As you're, you know,
[43:23] you're telling God, "Well, you've been
[43:24] bad. Well, you've not Well, you've not
[43:26] Hey, listen. Listen, Bozo, you are, you
[43:29] are the wretched. You are the one, Amen,
[43:33] that has defied the works of God. You
[43:36] are the one that's acted like an idiot.
[43:38] You are the one, Amen, that is a sinner
[43:41] that is bound for hell. God's the one
[43:44] who reached down in mercy and said, "I
[43:47] love you." God's the one that keeps
[43:50] reaching out and saying, "Amen. If you
[43:53] will surrender to me, I will give you my
[43:56] life."
[43:59] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[44:02] You say, "Well, I never say that to
[44:04] God." Your attitudes say it a lot. Our
[44:07] attitudes say, "Amen." Well, well, God.
[44:10] Well, and that's why we get our
[44:11] attitudes with God. But if you're going
[44:13] to receive anything from the Lord, now I
[44:16] want you to understand the attitude of
[44:18] Rebecca. Rebecca was, "Amen. I'm going
[44:22] to water. I'm going to give you water,
[44:25] my Lord. I'm going to give you I want to
[44:29] honor you. And I also want to honor the
[44:33] power that you're riding upon." Amen.
[44:35] Did you know that the camels represented
[44:37] power? The prophet of God said that. He
[44:40] said, "So what we've got to what Rebecca
[44:42] learned, she was going to give amen. The
[44:45] servant some water and she was also
[44:49] going to water the very thing that was
[44:53] going to take her to her husband." And I
[44:56] want to say when you come to the house
[44:58] of God, Amen. What are you doing when
[45:00] you're Amen. in the preacher? What are
[45:02] you doing? Amen. When you're saying,
[45:04] "Lord, let me have your word." You are
[45:07] giving water back to God. You're giving
[45:10] water. You're giving praise. You're
[45:12] saying, "Lord, I love you, Lord. Thank
[45:14] you." Amen. For for for giving the
[45:17] pastor a word for me this morning. Lord,
[45:20] I thank You're not sitting there as a
[45:22] knot on a log. And Amen. But no, you're
[45:25] you're in
[45:26] reication. You you are you are
[45:29] responding to his love to you and you
[45:32] say, "I want to give you water back.
[45:38] Hallelujah. Now, many have come and sit
[45:40] on a church pew and they sit there.
[45:43] Amen. The preacher preaches and they
[45:45] just have the they have a blank stare.
[45:48] They act like, "Wait, how do you think
[45:50] you're ever going to receive anything
[45:52] from the Lord? You've got to give him
[45:55] water. You've got to water the word when
[46:00] it comes."
[46:02] Hallelujah. Well, I just don't believe
[46:04] in lifting a man up. Hey, listen. You
[46:06] need to be lifting up the word. And when
[46:07] the pastor is preaching or any man
[46:09] behind the pullpit that is preaching,
[46:11] you should be behind that gift of God
[46:15] 100%. You ought to be giving worship
[46:19] unto the Lord.
[46:22] Amen. But not just giving the preacher
[46:25] an amen, but watering the camels. Now,
[46:29] the camels were the they're they're the
[46:31] burden bearers. They were the ones that
[46:34] were going to take this
[46:37] Rebecca to meet her Isaac.
[46:41] So the very camels, the very power that
[46:46] she watered was the very power. Oh,
[46:50] glory to God. The very power that you
[46:53] are watering. It's not man's
[46:56] imagination. It's not just some crazy
[46:58] feeling. It's not just, well, people are
[47:00] working up. No, we recognize the
[47:04] anointing is with the word and we are
[47:07] watering that
[47:10] anointing. I want something from the
[47:13] Lord. And I I can't get it with a blank
[47:16] stare. I can't get it with just Amen.
[47:19] not raising my hands. I can't get it
[47:22] when I'm not worshiping. I must water
[47:25] the word when it comes.
[47:30] Praise the Lord. Amen. You've got to
[47:34] water the word. Drink, my Lord, and I
[47:37] will also I will give your camels to
[47:39] drink also. Can you say amen? You see,
[47:42] it's when we have him lifted up and I I
[47:46] and we understand that we need his power
[47:50] and that we know we are so thankful that
[47:52] he has predestined us and that he has
[47:55] loved us with an eternal love. Amen. And
[47:57] before you know it, you have that deep
[47:59] sincerity like like the psalmist. Amen.
[48:02] As he longs to be in the house of the
[48:04] Lord there in Psalms 42 and one. As the
[48:08] heart panth after the waterbrooks, soul
[48:11] pneth my soul after thee, oh God, my
[48:14] soul thirsteth for God, for the living
[48:17] God. When shall I come that appear
[48:20] before my God? My tears have been my
[48:23] meat day and night, while they
[48:25] continually say unto me, "Where is thy
[48:27] God?" When I remember these things, I
[48:30] pour out my soul in me. For I had gone
[48:32] with a multitude when I went with him to
[48:34] the house of God, with the voice of joy
[48:37] and praise, with a multitude that kept
[48:40] the holy day. Now, now this is this is a
[48:42] man who has who is who has who has been
[48:44] away from Jerusalem and he and he and
[48:47] his
[48:48] desire oh how he loved coming to the
[48:51] house of God. How he loved having having
[48:54] worship. How he loved feeling the
[48:56] presence of God. and and he's saying, "I
[48:59] I I want to just go to the house of God
[49:02] again to come into his house and to hear
[49:06] his words of life and amen as the a as
[49:10] the deer is is is is craving and a and
[49:13] and and and longing after the water
[49:16] brook. My desire is is longing after
[49:20] God. I need God in my life. I need him
[49:24] like water. I can't I I can't survive
[49:26] without water. I I can't survive. And
[49:29] none of us can. We cannot You can
[49:31] survive with a lot of things without a
[49:32] lot of things, but you cannot survive
[49:34] without water. Amen. And And then
[49:36] Psalmist is
[49:37] saying, "When do I when can I come into
[49:41] your presence? When can I need this?"
[49:44] Just like the deer needs water. Yes,
[49:47] sir.
[49:49] So recognizing
[49:51] him, recognizing his
[49:54] power, and knowing how to water him. Can
[49:58] you say amen? Now Psalms 84:10, for a
[50:02] day in thy courts is better than a
[50:05] thousand. I'd rather be a doorkeeper in
[50:08] the house of my God than to dwell in the
[50:11] tents of the wicked. Now, what I'm
[50:14] trying to establish here is there is a
[50:17] desire especially when you come to
[50:20] church. Amen. Now, these scriptures that
[50:22] I'm reading to you, Amen. He is saying,
[50:25] I I I I'm looking forward to getting to
[50:29] church. I'm looking forward to going to
[50:32] the house of God with a joy, with a
[50:34] voice of joy and praise and to keep the
[50:37] holy days. And then this next one is a
[50:39] day in your courts is better than a
[50:41] thousand outside. Amen. One day in your
[50:45] courts is better than Amen. Three years
[50:48] uh outside your courts. I I need you. I
[50:53] I'm longing for you. You see, this is a
[50:56] man who has understood that God has what
[51:00] he needs.
[51:02] This is a man that understands that
[51:05] everything that he has done and all of
[51:09] his ways of getting himself together,
[51:12] Amen, just didn't cut it. He needed God
[51:17] more than he needed anything
[51:23] else. That
[51:25] creates passion.
[51:28] that
[51:30] creates
[51:32] desire. That is something that is deep
[51:35] inside that
[51:37] says I got to come into the presence of
[51:42] God and I can't come. You remember the
[51:45] queen when Queen Esther was coming to
[51:47] the coming to going before the king and
[51:51] she was a type of you and me. Now
[51:52] remember, Amen. and and and the Bible
[51:56] says she took off her her clothes and
[51:59] she put on her royal apparel in order to
[52:03] walk into the presence of the king. She
[52:07] couldn't come with just any kind of an
[52:09] attitude. And you can't come to church
[52:11] with just any kind of an attitude. You
[52:13] can't come to prayer with just any kind
[52:16] of an attitude. There must be royalty.
[52:20] There must be desire. There must be God.
[52:25] You are everything. I'm coming before
[52:28] you with worship. I'm coming before you
[52:31] with passion. I'm coming before you with
[52:34] Well, can you say amen? Amen. I love
[52:37] coming to the presence of God. Amen. And
[52:40] you know, there's one thing that I have
[52:41] found out when I come to the presence of
[52:43] God with a heart of thanksgiving and a
[52:46] heart of joy and a heart of the of of
[52:50] gratefulness to God that God always
[52:53] comes and meets my needs. Amen. The
[52:55] psalmist says there in Psalms 100 and
[52:59] and the and the first verse, make a
[53:01] joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye land.
[53:04] Serve the Lord with gladness. Come
[53:06] before his presence with singing. Know
[53:09] ye that the Lord he is God. It is he
[53:12] that has made us and not we ourselves.
[53:14] We are his people and the sheep of his
[53:17] pasture. Enter into his gates with
[53:20] thanksgiving and into his courts with
[53:23] praise. Be thankful. Somebody say be
[53:27] thankful unto him and bless his name.
[53:32] For the Lord is good. His mercy is
[53:38] everlasting. His truth endures to all
[53:42] generations. That causes a man to come
[53:46] in the presence of God with praise and
[53:50] worship and love and adoration because
[53:54] God has been
[53:58] good. But you'll never give him the
[54:00] praise or the worship, the gratitude.
[54:04] You'll never have a heart of
[54:06] thanksgiving as long as you're thinking
[54:08] that God's here and you're here and your
[54:11] demands aren't being met by
[54:13] God. God's got the demands. You carry
[54:17] them out. Everyone says God's got the
[54:19] demands.
[54:21] I am to carry them
[54:23] out. I am not the great one. I am not
[54:26] the one that has asked God into my world
[54:28] so that I can help him out. God's
[54:30] invited me into his world so that he can
[54:35] help me carry his will out.
[54:40] You want something from the Lord here
[54:41] this morning, then you've got to come
[54:43] with the right approach.
[54:45] You need s you need you need something
[54:47] that is beyond your ability here this
[54:49] morning, you've come to the right place
[54:52] because he is here. But there is many
[54:55] women that came to that well. Amen.
[54:58] There was many women that came to that
[55:00] well. I said there were many women who
[55:03] came to that well, but there was only
[55:05] one who had something in her to water
[55:09] the camels.
[55:12] Can you say
[55:14] amen? So our response to that minister,
[55:18] our response to the anointing is so
[55:21] important. You say, "I don't believe it
[55:23] that way." Well, amen.
[55:27] You will you will you you you're putting
[55:30] a block up. You're building a dam and
[55:32] there's no telling there. There is
[55:34] nothing that God can do for you until
[55:36] you come with the right approach.
[55:40] Well, praise the Lord.
[55:43] Now, clearing our hearts to come into
[55:46] his presence is so important. Hope this
[55:47] is okay here this morning. I'm sort of I
[55:49] I've just got a few quotes and and and
[55:52] scriptures here. And so, Amen. I'm just
[55:54] preaching I'm going to preach from my
[55:55] heart here this morning. I want. You see
[55:58] what what what I see a lots of times is
[56:01] is is is people will set like a like
[56:04] like a knot on the log in our church
[56:06] services and and and there and and and
[56:08] there is nothing that can ever move
[56:10] them. There is just nothing and and and
[56:13] and they're sour and and their lives are
[56:16] sour. There's nothing. And when they go
[56:18] to youth camp and they and they and they
[56:20] see the and and and and they they come
[56:23] there sour too. But with somebody else,
[56:27] amen, that there's 20 or 30 around them
[56:30] that is feeling, Amen. that that is
[56:32] worshiping, that is entering, God's
[56:34] presence comes down and and they're just
[56:37] they're just an old leech. Amen. They're
[56:40] they're just they're they're just an old
[56:42] sucker that that is just enjoying it
[56:44] because somebody else is. And they they
[56:46] they get to enjoy that for a moment and
[56:49] they come back with a hype. They come
[56:52] back, but you see they they but but you
[56:55] give them you give them another you give
[56:56] them a month and they're back down to
[56:58] sour pusses. They're they're all back
[57:00] down just Amen. They come there there's
[57:02] no there there there's there's nothing.
[57:04] Well, they might sing a few songs. They
[57:06] might do a few they might give a few
[57:08] this or that or they might but but you
[57:10] see Amen. But but the word means nothing
[57:12] to them. And the word is the very power
[57:15] that is going to rapture you. Not your
[57:19] emotions. It's the power or the
[57:21] revelation of the word. And when we
[57:25] understand that the word was given to us
[57:28] in this day, the open book was for us in
[57:33] this day to make a rapture.
[57:37] Then then then we want to watch our
[57:39] attitudes.
[57:41] We want to watch our
[57:44] discernment because we want to water the
[57:48] power that is going to take us back
[57:50] home.
[57:53] Hallelujah. Do you love him? Now, so am
[57:58] I.
[58:00] So, there's something you have to do in
[58:05] order to receive something back from the
[58:07] Lord. Brother Brandham says, "You have
[58:10] to do something to cause something to
[58:14] follow it." Jesus took a piece of bread
[58:17] and broke it and then multiplied from
[58:19] that piece of bread. He took water and
[58:22] poured it into the pitcher. Elijah took
[58:25] salt and put it into the cruise. Cut
[58:28] down a stick, throwed it on the water.
[58:30] It's something to symbolize. So when we
[58:33] want something from the Lord, there's
[58:35] something I must do first.
[58:43] Hallelujah.
[58:46] And it's not you doing it first. It's
[58:50] God already right there beside you. And
[58:53] he's wanting to know that you recognize
[58:56] where he's at.
[59:00] It wasn't that she had to do something
[59:03] first. She was simply an answer to what
[59:06] Abraham had already desired.
[59:09] The servant was standing there. The
[59:11] gifts were standing there. The the
[59:13] answer was already standing there. So it
[59:15] wasn't that she done something first.
[59:18] She had to come in line and her actions
[59:22] put her right in line and changed the
[59:24] history of her life.
[59:29] Oh, come on now. Amen. What? So you
[59:33] doing something first. I I I I and and
[59:37] and that's in the visible realm. That's
[59:38] in the physical realm. But I want to say
[59:41] he is already here.
[59:44] First thing has already been done. Now
[59:46] what is your action?
[59:49] He's already here. Where is he? Well,
[59:51] he's got a preacher up here preaching at
[59:53] you this morning. So your attitude
[59:55] toward that word will determine what you
[59:58] get.
[1:00:02] Can you say amen? You see, the attitude
[1:00:06] toward the word of the Lord, Amen, will
[1:00:09] determine. So you've got to do something
[1:00:11] first. Y'all remember when when brother
[1:00:13] Brandham w was out there and he and he
[1:00:16] and he told and he and he's this that we
[1:00:18] just read here is the unveiling of God
[1:00:20] in ' 64. And and when he says you have
[1:00:22] to pick something, do something in order
[1:00:24] to cause something to follow it, he was
[1:00:26] actually talking about, Amen. U he had
[1:00:28] already told the brothers out there out
[1:00:30] there in Arizona, he said, "In 24 hours,
[1:00:33] we're going to see the glory of the
[1:00:34] Lord." And he and he said he he picked
[1:00:36] up a rock and he threw it. Amen. And he
[1:00:40] says, "Now me doing something, me acting
[1:00:43] in faith," he said it caused the whirl
[1:00:45] as it's coming down, it caused the
[1:00:48] whirlwind to start. Amen. which was a
[1:00:51] which was a judgment sign. So he's
[1:00:54] talking about Amen. You've got to start
[1:00:56] something. You've got to throw it out
[1:00:59] there and then God takes what your faith
[1:01:02] is and brings it about in your life. Can
[1:01:05] you say amen? Amen. He says just clean
[1:01:08] out the channels where the f first rain
[1:01:11] can flow. The water is there. Christ is
[1:01:14] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:01:17] That smitten rock was in the wilderness
[1:01:19] and it's still there tonight. Thank God.
[1:01:22] Jesus cleaned it out for them again at
[1:01:25] Calvary, but they come right back around
[1:01:27] and throw the logs back in again and
[1:01:29] blocked off. Amen. You You know what?
[1:01:32] What it does to throw a log in a
[1:01:33] channel? What? What does it? Well, then
[1:01:36] all kinds of dirt hits it against the
[1:01:39] log and and wash it up and the first
[1:01:41] thing you know, we got all the water
[1:01:43] backed up like the beavers do and make a
[1:01:46] dam. You You got nothing to go through
[1:01:49] it. That's right. We We got too many
[1:01:51] beaver preachers today trying to dam all
[1:01:54] the water up and say, "Well, this is
[1:01:56] ours. This is just here. Uh th this
[1:01:59] belongs to us." And what happens to it?
[1:02:01] It becomes stagnated. And that's what
[1:02:04] the matter with a lot of our
[1:02:05] organizations trying to back up the
[1:02:07] water for your organization only and
[1:02:09] it's got stagnant. You know, stagnated
[1:02:11] water gets these little wiggle tails in
[1:02:14] it. And that's what's the matter with
[1:02:15] the church. A little wiggle to little
[1:02:18] wiggle in here and wiggle out there and
[1:02:21] days of miracles has passed and no such
[1:02:23] thing as divine healing. Can't set still
[1:02:26] five minutes in a meeting. My goodness.
[1:02:28] Stagnated waters. Beaver Dam. Blow it
[1:02:31] out. He says, "There's a fountain filled
[1:02:33] with blood drawn from Emanuel's veins
[1:02:36] where sinners plunge beneath the flood,
[1:02:39] lose all their guilty stains. The
[1:02:41] prophet said, "Go down there and dig all
[1:02:43] them logs out." Can I hear an amen?
[1:02:48] He says, "Now we got the people. Just
[1:02:51] clean out the channels. The people's all
[1:02:53] right. Get the channels cleaned out so
[1:02:55] the Holy Spirit can come in. All your
[1:02:58] fanaticisms and isms and and everything
[1:03:01] else in the church, clean that out.
[1:03:03] Amen. The rocks already smitten. The
[1:03:05] waters are fresh and they're running,
[1:03:07] but our ecclesiastical systems have
[1:03:10] damned up the streams. He said, "Clean
[1:03:12] those things out. You won't have to
[1:03:14] anchor uh uh you won't have to have
[1:03:16] another rushing wind. You won't need
[1:03:18] wind or any rain, but yet there'll be
[1:03:21] water there. Oh, brother. Not a new
[1:03:23] system. Not a new system. What we need
[1:03:25] is to clean out the system we got.
[1:03:30] Get all the logs out of it, all the
[1:03:31] differences out of it, and all the
[1:03:32] fussing and stewing and everything and
[1:03:35] things like that away from them. The
[1:03:36] waters will go to flowing again. There
[1:03:38] will be love and joy. Joy like a river
[1:03:40] flowing all over everybody just in love
[1:03:44] with one another. Can you say amen? Now,
[1:03:48] so, so there were two choices that was
[1:03:50] going on at that well that
[1:03:52] day. She he was
[1:03:55] there, Eleazar was there to choose a
[1:04:00] bride. And Eleazar said, "Lord, the one
[1:04:03] that is
[1:04:04] sensitive, the one that you are
[1:04:10] drawing." See, it's not it's not the
[1:04:14] preacher making you a Christian.
[1:04:16] It's not anyone else making you a
[1:04:18] Christian. Hallelujah. It's the spirit
[1:04:22] drawing and it's not Eleazar's job to
[1:04:25] say, "Hey, you, you're the
[1:04:27] one." The spirit was to move upon
[1:04:30] Rebecca. And Rebecca,
[1:04:35] she's the one that's sitting in the
[1:04:36] pews.
[1:04:40] She's the one that's
[1:04:42] saying, "I feel something in my heart.
[1:04:46] Lord, let me surrender to you." You see,
[1:04:50] surrender is nothing more than just
[1:04:53] throwing out all of our pride and
[1:04:55] saying, "Lord, I want to do it your
[1:04:57] way."
[1:05:00] Did you know that that's the hardest
[1:05:02] thing for us to do is
[1:05:04] surrender? Especially us bullheaded men.
[1:05:08] Amen. But you women ain't too far behind
[1:05:11] us. Amen.
[1:05:14] And we don't like it. We don't like it
[1:05:17] because when we surrender, we ain't got
[1:05:20] control no more.
[1:05:23] We We're not in control of ourselves.
[1:05:25] We're not We want to control. Oh, we
[1:05:27] say, "Oh, Jesus, I give you my life, but
[1:05:30] I'm doing I'm going to handle this and
[1:05:32] I've got to do this." Maybe God don't
[1:05:34] want that handle.
[1:05:36] Maybe God wants you to just surrender
[1:05:42] you, big boy. You, Sally Sue. God wants
[1:05:47] you to surrender you to him.
[1:05:57] Oh, we want everyone else to
[1:05:59] surrender, but we don't want to
[1:06:01] surrender. Amen. I want Elelliana. I
[1:06:04] want her to get right with
[1:06:06] God. Lord, help her to surrender. I want
[1:06:10] my wife. Lord, no. It takes two Holy
[1:06:13] Ghost on
[1:06:19] her, but my
[1:06:21] attitudes, well, I'm
[1:06:24] fine. You're damning
[1:06:27] up the only source of victory for your
[1:06:30] life.
[1:06:32] You've got to
[1:06:34] surrender. Well, hallelujah.
[1:06:37] I said, "Hallelujah. You've got to
[1:06:40] surrender." Amen. You got to s You say,
[1:06:42] "But but but I'm just a little girl."
[1:06:44] You've got to surrender. I'm just a
[1:06:46] little boy. I You've got to surrender.
[1:06:49] Well, I I' I've been serving the Lord a
[1:06:51] long time. You must
[1:06:54] surrender everything you are to him
[1:06:59] now.
[1:07:01] Here she comes. She's sitting there. She
[1:07:06] comes. The spirit of the Lord is already
[1:07:08] dealing with
[1:07:10] her. Hallelujah. Did you know the
[1:07:12] prophet said, I I I just looked up Amen.
[1:07:15] Uh uh the other day, working on both
[1:07:18] ends. You know how many times the
[1:07:20] prophet says it over and over, God
[1:07:22] working on both ends. Working on both
[1:07:24] ends. Amen. It wasn't just it wasn't
[1:07:27] just the the the model servant Eleer.
[1:07:30] Amen. The the it wasn't just God's
[1:07:34] servant, but it was it was
[1:07:37] also God's Rebecca. God had already had
[1:07:43] Rebecca in his book, in his mind for
[1:07:47] Isaac before the world began.
[1:07:51] So God's not just sending you a message,
[1:07:54] but his Holy Spirit is working on your
[1:07:58] heart
[1:08:00] to surrender.
[1:08:04] Isn't it Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it
[1:08:05] easy to just let go and surrender when
[1:08:08] you know that God's behind the whole
[1:08:10] thing? When God's behind the whole
[1:08:12] thing, I don't have to figure the
[1:08:14] message out. I don't have to figure uh
[1:08:17] figure my life out. I don't have to
[1:08:19] figure out tomorrow. All I've got to do
[1:08:21] is surrender today. All I've got to do
[1:08:23] is give myself today. God will take care
[1:08:26] of my tomorrow as well. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:29] And you know what I've done when Amen.
[1:08:31] when I have surrendered Wendell Martin
[1:08:33] and I've laid myself on the line and I
[1:08:36] have I've humbled myself before God. You
[1:08:39] know what I have found out? His glory
[1:08:41] working through me. Amen. And my wife my
[1:08:44] my wife, she she she gets the blessings
[1:08:47] of it. Amen. God takes care of her. God
[1:08:50] takes care of this situation. God takes
[1:08:52] care of that situation. And it's all
[1:08:54] because I've allowed him. I am the
[1:08:57] Rebecca. I am the one that is watering
[1:09:00] his word. That's watering the power.
[1:09:03] That's watering the anointing. My job is
[1:09:06] to say, "My father who art in heaven,
[1:09:10] hallowed, sanctified, set apart is your
[1:09:13] name. I want your kingdom to come on
[1:09:17] earth and live in me.
[1:09:22] Can you say
[1:09:25] amen? Now, brother Brandham in the time
[1:09:27] of decision uh sermon he says people
[1:09:31] today is something like
[1:09:33] Elizer. Again, Elzar is not the only one
[1:09:36] that must conscientiously make the right
[1:09:37] choice for decision. There was many
[1:09:40] women in the city, young girls for him
[1:09:43] to choose from. He didn't take his own
[1:09:45] choice. He trusted God's
[1:09:47] choice. He took the one that had a
[1:09:50] supernatural sign and answered a prayer.
[1:09:53] I submitted to the Lord. And today, you
[1:09:56] want to find a place to put your money.
[1:09:58] Sometimes you you you want to find a
[1:10:01] place to put your membership uh
[1:10:03] someplace that you you want to go to
[1:10:05] church. And there are plenty of churches
[1:10:07] to go to. There's plenty of forms of
[1:10:09] religion to go to, but you've got to
[1:10:12] make a choice whether you're going to
[1:10:13] submit yourself to a spiritual church or
[1:10:15] a formal church. You've got to make your
[1:10:18] decision. You've got to take the way
[1:10:20] with the church that Jesus ordained on
[1:10:22] the day of Pentecost or you've got to
[1:10:24] take some of these man-made creeds that
[1:10:27] we worship today. You've got to make
[1:10:29] your choice. You might think it's a
[1:10:31] little despised, but it's reliable. If
[1:10:34] it isn't, if it wasn't, Christ wouldn't
[1:10:37] have ordained it. If it wasn't so, Paul
[1:10:40] wouldn't have received the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:42] All the apostles wouldn't have received
[1:10:43] the Holy Ghost because the God of
[1:10:46] salvation said, "Go ye into all the
[1:10:47] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:10:49] creature. These signs shall follow them
[1:10:50] that believe." And just as Eleazar
[1:10:53] watched the sign on the girl, you will
[1:10:56] have to watch the sign.
[1:11:01] As Eleazar had to watch it, now you must
[1:11:06] watch it. Can you say amen? He goes on
[1:11:08] says, "You've got to make up your mind.
[1:11:09] You've got to make a choice. This may be
[1:11:12] your last time to make a choice.
[1:11:13] Tomorrow may be too late. God might have
[1:11:16] chose you to eternal life. But if you
[1:11:18] don't make up your mind and accept it,
[1:11:22] somebody else will take your place.
[1:11:25] Maybe tomorrow will be that time. God
[1:11:28] may be wanting to empty this whole roll
[1:11:30] of wheelchairs here tonight. I know he
[1:11:33] does. I know he wants to heal every sick
[1:11:35] person. Tonight, you'll have to make
[1:11:37] your choice. You say, "Well, Brother
[1:11:39] Brandham, you're going to have a prayer
[1:11:41] line tomorrow night." Let that be for
[1:11:44] somebody else. You must make up your
[1:11:47] mind quickly.
[1:11:51] Don't wait for it another If God is here
[1:11:54] tonight, just surrender to him right
[1:11:56] now.
[1:12:00] Don't wait for the prayer line tomorrow.
[1:12:02] God's wanting to empty these rolling
[1:12:03] wheelchairs out right now.
[1:12:06] Let it happen now. Oh, can you say amen?
[1:12:10] See, see we but in our mind we've got
[1:12:13] ways of thinking. But if the spirit is
[1:12:15] moving, that's when the Holy Spirit
[1:12:19] Amen. Hallelujah. I remember Sister Kala
[1:12:22] some years back. She was having some
[1:12:24] female problems. Amen. And she had she
[1:12:27] had talked to my wife and about it and
[1:12:30] and it was and and she had she had been
[1:12:32] struggling for for some time. And I and
[1:12:35] I told her, I said, "The next time the
[1:12:39] spirit of the Lord
[1:12:41] moves, you you feel his presence." I
[1:12:44] said, "Just immediately respond to it."
[1:12:48] And she done that. The spirit of the
[1:12:50] Lord come the next time. The spirit of
[1:12:52] the Lord was just so and the spirit of
[1:12:54] the Lord moved upon her. And we prayed.
[1:12:56] We were in the old building. And did you
[1:12:58] know that the presence of God that day
[1:13:02] totally healed Sister
[1:13:04] Khalila just like
[1:13:07] that with all the doctor's visits and
[1:13:10] this and that and the other and all. But
[1:13:11] God came down right then. Why? Because
[1:13:15] she learned that I've got to water his
[1:13:19] camel when he is near.
[1:13:25] Did you know I I remember
[1:13:29] my my little
[1:13:31] uncle, little uncle, because he was a
[1:13:33] year younger than me. And uh he he just
[1:13:36] had a hard time. He was just awkward. He
[1:13:40] just he just had a hard time
[1:13:42] surrendering. And you know, he had he
[1:13:46] had gotten to the world and just really,
[1:13:48] you know, messed up. But he he wanted to
[1:13:50] do what is right. He loved the Lord. and
[1:13:53] he'd come back to church and you know
[1:13:56] the guy was just awkward. He just he was
[1:13:58] awkward around everybody. We'd try we'd
[1:14:01] sing and he you wouldn't even you
[1:14:03] wouldn't have even thought he was a
[1:14:04] Martin. He couldn't keep a beat. He he
[1:14:08] he couldn't sing. He he just the poor
[1:14:10] guy I
[1:14:12] just you know and he would just try
[1:14:14] there you know and and
[1:14:18] uh and so we talk you know I would talk
[1:14:21] to and Sean and I I would would would
[1:14:23] talk to him and and uh well one night he
[1:14:26] called and he says I I want to give my
[1:14:29] life to the Lord and I said well that's
[1:14:31] just wonderful. It's 2 o'clock in the
[1:14:32] morning and I thought he was drunk and
[1:14:35] uh I said well that's wonderful. I'll
[1:14:36] tell you what. call me back in the
[1:14:37] morning and then we'll we'll have
[1:14:39] another conversation. He goes, "Don't
[1:14:41] blow me off." He says, "I want to give
[1:14:43] my life to the Lord." And
[1:14:46] uh I said, "All right." So I on the
[1:14:50] phone I he was in Tulsa. I was here. It
[1:14:52] was long distance. So we prayed, gave
[1:14:55] his heart to the Lord. And he calls me
[1:14:57] back here in a few minutes. And he says,
[1:14:59] "I want to get baptized." And I said,
[1:15:01] "That's good. That's good. Tomorrow we
[1:15:04] he says,"Wendle, I want to get baptized
[1:15:06] tonight.
[1:15:07] I said, "Are you drinking, Nathan?" "No,
[1:15:09] I'm not drinking. I want to get right
[1:15:12] with God
[1:15:14] tonight." And I I said, "Well, man, it's
[1:15:18] it's 2:00 in the morning." And
[1:15:21] uh and I said, "I I'm not I I'm being
[1:15:25] very sincere. I will I will meet you in
[1:15:27] Tulsa. We we'll meet at Brother Buruses
[1:15:29] in Claremore. I'll baptize you
[1:15:31] tomorrow." He says, "All right. All
[1:15:33] right." So, we baptized him. baptized my
[1:15:37] my my dad's little brother. Amen. And uh
[1:15:41] night and uh he was he was 18 years old.
[1:15:45] Baptized him. Well, he he you know he he
[1:15:49] was one of those guys when we're all
[1:15:51] praying. He was just looking around at
[1:15:53] us all trying to figure out, you
[1:15:56] know, said Nathan, you gota got be
[1:16:00] respectful of your head and Okay. All
[1:16:04] right. So, you know,
[1:16:05] He was awkward. He was just awkward. And
[1:16:08] uh I said, "Now you need the Holy
[1:16:11] Ghost." And uh he said, "Well, what do I
[1:16:13] do?" So I I took him through Acts two
[1:16:18] and and and showed him what And he and
[1:16:20] he and he he say, "Okay, all right. All
[1:16:22] right." Then he'd say, "Well, I I need
[1:16:24] the Holy Ghost." I know, Nathan. I know.
[1:16:27] I know. You got to surrender. It's
[1:16:29] surrendering to the Lord. And it's okay.
[1:16:31] All right. All right.
[1:16:33] And then it it come back, you know, just
[1:16:36] 50 when I need the Holy
[1:16:39] Ghost. Yes. Yes. I said, "It'll come.
[1:16:41] It'll come. I don't know when. I don't
[1:16:42] know how I don't know how you and God's
[1:16:44] going to do this. You, but you're just
[1:16:47] going to have to just really talk to
[1:16:48] him, love him, tell him you need just I
[1:16:51] said, and it could come up here. He
[1:16:53] would come up, you know, he'd come up
[1:16:54] for prayer and I'd pray for him and and
[1:16:57] and he'd just be looking at me. I said,
[1:16:58] "You got to help me out. You got to help
[1:17:01] me out." And I and and uh uh well I was
[1:17:06] up there preaching one service and he
[1:17:10] was back on the third row over here
[1:17:12] about where where uh Sister Tabitha
[1:17:14] would be and I'm up there preaching and
[1:17:17] all of a sudden this
[1:17:20] dude jumps up both hands in the air
[1:17:24] and I got it.
[1:17:28] He scared me and the whole congregation.
[1:17:30] I mean, we I I about
[1:17:35] died. I got it. I said, "The Holy
[1:17:38] Ghost." Yes. Yes. I got it. Their
[1:17:43] tears. He said, "I I know. I know.
[1:17:46] Something just
[1:17:51] happened." And I said,
[1:17:54] "Nathan, God bless you.
[1:18:00] See, it's not in the It's not in a
[1:18:04] format. It's not in a format. Yes, it
[1:18:07] can happen here, but but but it's but
[1:18:10] it's desires. Going back to what I first
[1:18:12] said, you got to want this more than you
[1:18:14] want anything.
[1:18:20] Nathan was
[1:18:21] changed. Nathan was
[1:18:24] changed. He was still the fidgety guy.
[1:18:30] I and he he'd drive all the way from
[1:18:33] toss up here every service and uh he
[1:18:38] bought him a whole bunch he bought him a
[1:18:40] whole bunch of New Testaments. was
[1:18:43] little. I mean, his truck was packed and
[1:18:45] he was just constantly passing out these
[1:18:47] New Testament Bibles and he would pick
[1:18:50] up hitchhikers and he'd have them a
[1:18:52] captivated audience and he would he he'
[1:18:56] just preach to them about the Lord and
[1:18:58] how God can save them or how he was
[1:19:00] saved from drugs and alcohol and how God
[1:19:02] changed his
[1:19:05] life. He was
[1:19:07] changed. I remember the service, the
[1:19:09] last service that that he was here. He
[1:19:11] was he was 19 years old and we were in a
[1:19:12] tent meeting. Amen. And I and I I I
[1:19:16] talked to I I tried to talk. We had a
[1:19:18] late service and uh and so I I told him
[1:19:21] I said, "Man, I wish you would just
[1:19:22] wait." He goes, "Man, I got to work
[1:19:23] tomorrow." And he said, "I want to go on
[1:19:25] home." And and it was already after
[1:19:27] midnight. And and uh uh so he he's he's
[1:19:33] going back home. Of course, you know,
[1:19:34] back then there was no cell phones or
[1:19:35] anything like that. And on his way back
[1:19:37] home,
[1:19:40] um, we we got a phone call
[1:19:43] that and wanted, you know, Nathan had
[1:19:46] died and had a car wreck and and they
[1:19:50] were asking,
[1:19:52] uh, you know, he was way off, he was way
[1:19:55] off the beaten track and he had just he
[1:19:58] had picked up a hitchhiker and he was
[1:20:00] talking to the hitchhiker and took took
[1:20:01] the hitchhiker to where he needed to go.
[1:20:03] And then on his way home, he had had a
[1:20:06] car
[1:20:07] wreck. And I I I looked there at that
[1:20:10] that last service that that Nathan was
[1:20:12] there. He was still just as awkward as
[1:20:15] awkward could
[1:20:17] be, but he had such a love for the Lord.
[1:20:20] And his own expression for the Lord was
[1:20:22] just he just loved him so much. And he
[1:20:26] he would
[1:20:27] just the glory of the Lord was all over
[1:20:30] him. And I I I I looked there and I
[1:20:33] thought, see, God had something special
[1:20:36] for a boy that didn't quite fit in the
[1:20:39] mold. Well, that should that should make
[1:20:42] that should make all of us feel
[1:20:44] good. Sometimes you might think, well, I
[1:20:46] just don't fit in with the other young
[1:20:48] people or I don't fit in with this
[1:20:49] teenager or that you listen, all it
[1:20:52] takes is just surrendering ourselves to
[1:20:54] the Lord.
[1:20:58] And there were there were there were
[1:21:01] Bibles scattered all over the road, you
[1:21:07] know. It was a
[1:21:09] surrender. Are y'all understanding? So
[1:21:12] when the word was being preached,
[1:21:14] Nathan, though he didn't quite fit
[1:21:17] into to a church mold, if you want to
[1:21:19] put it that way, his desire was to be at
[1:21:22] that church every He was there. He was
[1:21:25] there every service. He was going,
[1:21:27] "Nathan, Nathan was forever more changed
[1:21:30] that that year. It it that year was in
[1:21:33] such an most incredible year as as I
[1:21:36] watched him." Amen. And loving God like
[1:21:39] he loved him and giving like he could
[1:21:42] God done something for that young man. A
[1:21:45] a and and and he had this relationship
[1:21:48] with God. I, you know, I just couldn't
[1:21:50] see myself with with with a hundred of
[1:21:53] those little New Testament Bibles,
[1:21:55] passing them out to everybody that I
[1:21:57] come in contact with. And and he was
[1:21:59] just as awkward when witnessing as he
[1:22:01] was with me. Amen. He'd come over there,
[1:22:04] you know, he'd just see it and he'd pull
[1:22:06] out a Bible. He'd just stand there and
[1:22:07] hand it to you and just just sort of
[1:22:08] awkward there, you know, have his hands
[1:22:10] in in jeans. That he goes, "I want you
[1:22:13] to read it. That is real." And I mean he
[1:22:16] was just I mean it was it was it was it
[1:22:18] it was it was coming out of him.
[1:22:23] Are you hearing me? See see but but but
[1:22:27] watering it watering the presence of
[1:22:29] God. Watering God. You're here and I
[1:22:33] recognize your presence and I must I
[1:22:37] must worship you and love you and give
[1:22:41] you my all while you're here with me.
[1:22:48] Then the presence of the Lord
[1:22:50] comes. Amen.
[1:22:53] When
[1:22:54] Elijah come to the Lord
[1:22:57] or the come up to the
[1:23:00] widow woman there in the days of of
[1:23:05] Ahab and and and
[1:23:08] there you know she started walking and
[1:23:12] and and and and giving uh uh you know
[1:23:16] when you know she she was she was making
[1:23:18] her last two cakes for her and her son
[1:23:20] and they would
[1:23:22] And and then when the when the prophet
[1:23:24] walked up to her and said, "Ma'am, could
[1:23:27] you give me a drink of water?" She
[1:23:29] didn't have much
[1:23:30] water, but there was something about the
[1:23:33] witness. Now
[1:23:35] listen, the scripture says that I God
[1:23:39] had already told Elijah when the
[1:23:41] waterbrook dried up, brook Cherith, he
[1:23:44] said, "Go to Zerapath, for I have
[1:23:46] commanded a woman to feed you there.
[1:23:51] So, he's walking
[1:23:53] up, but it
[1:23:55] takes it takes that widow woman to
[1:24:00] recognize the presence of God working on
[1:24:03] her end. She has to do something. She
[1:24:08] has to respond with the right response.
[1:24:12] So when the water when when he asked for
[1:24:14] the water, she turns around to tell him,
[1:24:18] "Well, I" But she says, "Well, but
[1:24:20] that's a kind man." Yeah, I'll get you a
[1:24:25] water. And then he says, "And while
[1:24:28] you're at
[1:24:29] it, make me a
[1:24:34] cake." She turned around and she says,
[1:24:36] "I
[1:24:41] There's something about this man.
[1:24:42] There's something in your heart that is
[1:24:44] that is drawn to this man. There's no
[1:24:46] other way to explain it, folks. There
[1:24:49] was no one there saying, "Hey, this is a
[1:24:50] good guy. He's a prophet." She had to
[1:24:53] rely on that supernatural something on
[1:24:56] the
[1:24:58] inside. Her response was going to make
[1:25:00] the
[1:25:02] difference. Her
[1:25:05] response, she says, "But I I don't
[1:25:09] All I've got is enough for one more meal
[1:25:12] for me and my boy and we're going to
[1:25:17] die. She looked at
[1:25:21] it. She said, "But I'm going to give it
[1:25:23] to
[1:25:26] you." It was the presence of the Lord
[1:25:29] upon her heart that was preparing her
[1:25:31] for victory.
[1:25:34] And because she responded in the right
[1:25:36] way, because she watered the anointing
[1:25:40] while it was there, because she watered
[1:25:42] the word of the Lord with her faith
[1:25:47] after she gives it, then the prophet
[1:25:49] says, "The cruise of oil and the barrel
[1:25:52] of mill will never run dry." Thus saith
[1:25:58] the Lord.
[1:26:01] Oh, this ain't the lottery. This is not
[1:26:05] the lottery. This is the genuine
[1:26:06] presence of God coming upon you. And
[1:26:09] you've got to
[1:26:12] respond. You've got to surrender. You've
[1:26:15] got to
[1:26:19] say, "But my son, but my but but my
[1:26:23] mama, but my" You've got to be willing
[1:26:25] to say, "I'm going to leave that all
[1:26:28] behind, but I'm going to follow
[1:26:32] you. What about my girlfriend? My
[1:26:34] boyfriend? Well, my what? Well, my
[1:26:36] friend. It doesn't matter what anybody
[1:26:38] else says. What about my job? What No,
[1:26:41] it doesn't matter. There's something
[1:26:44] that is that is yearning on the inside
[1:26:46] of me. There's that predestinated sea.
[1:26:49] There is the deep calling to the deep.
[1:26:50] There is that something taught of the
[1:26:52] father that I don't even
[1:26:54] understand. But I'm going to surrender
[1:26:57] myself to
[1:27:00] it. Hallelujah. Can you say
[1:27:03] amen?
[1:27:05] Now the prophet would
[1:27:07] say
[1:27:09] amen. When God, he says, what was it?
[1:27:12] God works on both ends of the line. God
[1:27:15] had shown Elijah a vision, go down to
[1:27:16] the city, for I have commanded, not the
[1:27:18] ravens this time, to feed you, but I've
[1:27:20] commanded a widow woman and took him to
[1:27:23] the poorest of the
[1:27:24] poorest. Took him to the most ridiculous
[1:27:27] of the
[1:27:28] ridiculouses to show his power
[1:27:30] through. Well, glory to
[1:27:34] God. Jerus had to make a
[1:27:37] decision. Jerus had to make a decision.
[1:27:39] He was a secret believer the whole time.
[1:27:42] But when but when the but he just never
[1:27:45] could show his colors because he loved
[1:27:48] what he was doing. He loved where he was
[1:27:50] at. Loved his
[1:27:51] position. But when things
[1:27:54] got so out of control for him. His
[1:27:57] daughter was lying there dying just any
[1:27:59] minute. And all the doctors had helped.
[1:28:01] And though he had a good position and
[1:28:03] though he he come to his he come to his
[1:28:07] wife and I I I I just broke in here. He
[1:28:10] says, "Oh, I can just see him. I could
[1:28:13] just only see him. I will express, oh,
[1:28:15] what what will I do? I I will lose my
[1:28:18] job. I will lose my congregation. What
[1:28:20] will I do? Well, maybe I I'd better not
[1:28:22] go." And walked in. Look at the little
[1:28:23] girl. She's almost gone. What happened?
[1:28:25] Right down in his heart, God began to
[1:28:26] work. Jarus, this is your time. You
[1:28:30] know, God gets Christ a a vision. God
[1:28:32] works on both ends in the line. He he
[1:28:35] begin to get in his heart. Oh, I believe
[1:28:37] I'll go see him. So, he calls Miss Jerus
[1:28:40] and says, "You know, honey, I I've been
[1:28:42] thinking of something." Oh, dear. Yes,
[1:28:44] dear. What is it? Well, of course, you
[1:28:45] know, I'm pastor here. Yes. Uh-huh. What
[1:28:48] What are we going to preach? You going
[1:28:50] to get to preach your funeral? Her
[1:28:51] funeral. Well, I'm not thinking about
[1:28:53] it. You know, honey, I you know, I
[1:28:55] sometimes ago, I I was on the other side
[1:28:57] of the lake and I seen this prophet of
[1:28:59] Galilee and I seen him do a miracle
[1:29:01] there one day that just startled me. And
[1:29:02] you know, I believe he could help my
[1:29:05] daughter, her child. Don't you believe
[1:29:07] so, honey? And she said, you know, I
[1:29:10] want to tell you, sweetheart, I believe
[1:29:12] the same thing. Well, honey, you you
[1:29:14] mean you've been believing all this
[1:29:16] time? Yes. So have I. Oh my. Peace is
[1:29:20] going to come to that home pretty soon
[1:29:22] when father and mother can get right
[1:29:24] with God. Something is going to happen.
[1:29:27] Why? He said, "Are you willing? If they
[1:29:29] excommunicate me, are you willing to
[1:29:30] stick by me, dear? I'll stick by you
[1:29:32] through thick and thin. That's my
[1:29:33] marriage vow. I'll stick by you. If you
[1:29:35] if you want to go get him, I'll be here
[1:29:38] on my knees praying till you get back."
[1:29:40] Let the congregation say anything they
[1:29:42] want to. We believe God.
[1:29:45] This was Jarus.
[1:29:48] It says, "I
[1:29:50] I I need him. And I'm willing to s I'm
[1:29:54] willing to let it all
[1:29:57] go. I don't care about my prestige. I
[1:30:00] don't care about my reputation. I don't
[1:30:01] care about
[1:30:07] nothing." Well, glory to
[1:30:10] God. Oh, glory to God. You know that
[1:30:13] feeling that I feel? I know he's here
[1:30:16] right now. You say, "How do you know it,
[1:30:17] brother Winhill?" Because it's that same
[1:30:19] something that has led me to him many,
[1:30:22] many, many times before. He's
[1:30:27] here. Your
[1:30:31] attitude will either take you to
[1:30:34] him or down the power
[1:30:41] through. I want to be willing.
[1:30:45] Praise the Lord. I preach preached the
[1:30:46] last Sunday you hear on love. If you
[1:30:49] could only know the depths of God's
[1:30:51] love. His love is here. His love is
[1:30:53] expended. His love is so
[1:31:00] great. Can I have a few more
[1:31:03] minutes? It was in the darkest
[1:31:07] hour for little Georgie Georgie Carter.
[1:31:12] Georgie Georgie Georgie
[1:31:15] Carter,
[1:31:17] man been
[1:31:19] praying. This this girl had been
[1:31:21] crippled for nine
[1:31:24] years. She was down to 30 something
[1:31:26] pounds. Couldn't get out of bed.
[1:31:28] Couldn't even Couldn't even spit in a in
[1:31:32] a
[1:31:33] cup. In order to get her on a bed pan,
[1:31:36] they had to
[1:31:44] this
[1:31:45] girl, she had heard, she had read a book
[1:31:49] that brother Brenam put out, Jesus
[1:31:51] Christ, the same yesterday, day and
[1:31:53] forever. And in that book, he had told
[1:31:56] the story
[1:31:58] of of the nail
[1:32:01] girl, the the the girl that that had
[1:32:05] been healed of
[1:32:08] tuberculosis and how God had healed her.
[1:32:12] And that that
[1:32:13] that said something. And now now her her
[1:32:16] parents were Church of Christ, I believe
[1:32:18] it was, and and they didn't believe in
[1:32:20] anything of this, but she would sit
[1:32:22] there
[1:32:23] and she would just
[1:32:25] cry. I wish I could get into the
[1:32:27] presence of that man and have that man
[1:32:30] to pray for me like he done that with
[1:32:32] that that girl, that male
[1:32:36] girl. And she be to cry and pray.
[1:32:42] You say, you you you say, "Well, I I I I
[1:32:45] brother Wendle, I know. I I pray and I
[1:32:47] pray and it just seem like God doesn't
[1:32:49] hear." He does hear. God sent us a
[1:32:52] prophet so that we could sort of see
[1:32:54] what God does on both sides of the line.
[1:32:56] What you don't see, God allowed the
[1:32:58] prophet to see it.
[1:33:01] And while he was out in prayer, no, he
[1:33:04] was asleep.
[1:33:07] And all of a sudden, he heard this
[1:33:09] crying, this bang. There was a lamb that
[1:33:13] was crying,
[1:33:15] "Milltown,
[1:33:17] Miltown." The lamb was lost, caught in a
[1:33:20] thicket.
[1:33:21] He woke up and he and he and and and
[1:33:23] there he was in the vision, go to
[1:33:26] Miltown. Well, he man, he got up. He
[1:33:30] didn't he never even heard of Miltown.
[1:33:32] He he he went and asked some brothers
[1:33:35] and they said, "Well, there's a Miltown
[1:33:37] and a certain place and they went over
[1:33:38] and it wasn't it wasn't Miltown. It was
[1:33:40] it was it was
[1:33:42] Middletown." And and and they said,
[1:33:44] "This ain't it." And so they and then he
[1:33:46] asked they said, "Oh, no. It's way back
[1:33:48] up. It's it's I think it is down in the
[1:33:51] southern part of the states and and
[1:33:53] there and and how how many wants me to
[1:33:56] just read it to you. He said she he says
[1:33:58] so so Mr. So Mr. Hall come to me and
[1:34:02] said he said brother Billy that that
[1:34:04] little girl lives uh uh no yeah okay so
[1:34:08] let me let let me set the story up a
[1:34:09] little bit more here. So so he went to
[1:34:12] Miltown and and and getting over there
[1:34:15] was supernatural. the Lord led him there
[1:34:18] and and he says he he got him a little
[1:34:21] box to set up outside the the local
[1:34:24] store there to preach and and uh you
[1:34:28] know and then he he thought well I got I
[1:34:30] got to find out how to how to get a
[1:34:31] crowd because he didn't have the girl's
[1:34:33] name. He didn't know what he was there
[1:34:34] for. He didn't know what it was about.
[1:34:35] All he saw was a lamb and it said
[1:34:36] Miltown. And so there uh uh he he ends
[1:34:41] up seeing a church and he starts a
[1:34:43] revival. The church been closed down. He
[1:34:45] started a revival the first night. Amen.
[1:34:48] Uh this this one brother that that he
[1:34:51] just mentioned, Mr. Hall gave his heart
[1:34:53] to the Lord and he become the pastor of
[1:34:55] that church for many many years. And so
[1:34:58] uh he's there and they're they're
[1:35:00] they're preaching and and uh man uh he
[1:35:04] he goes one you
[1:35:06] know many are getting saved and and or a
[1:35:10] few are getting saved and he goes out to
[1:35:11] baptize them. So after the baptism, he
[1:35:13] says, now he says, "Mr. Hall, come to me
[1:35:15] and say, "Brother Billy, there's a girl
[1:35:17] that lives over here named Georgie
[1:35:18] Carter. She's laid there nine years and
[1:35:21] eight months. I I want you to get uh" He
[1:35:23] said, "I want you to get your address
[1:35:24] and write her, each one of you
[1:35:25] personally, a letter. Let let her write
[1:35:27] to you." He said, "Now," he's laid there
[1:35:30] 9 years and 8 months. She's
[1:35:31] approximately weighs 35 pounds of human
[1:35:34] bones. And so she was about 5 foot tall.
[1:35:36] She was about 22 or 26 years old,
[1:35:39] something on that order. She had been
[1:35:41] laying there now for nine years and
[1:35:43] eight months caused by a foul thing that
[1:35:46] was done to her and and but she but said
[1:35:49] her her people belongs to this church
[1:35:51] down here and there's a certain church
[1:35:52] won't call the denomination. They they
[1:35:54] don't believe that Jesus heals and they
[1:35:57] don't even believe the spirit or nothing
[1:35:59] else. But they said to their members,
[1:36:01] "If any person goes to that idiotic
[1:36:03] Baptist preacher praying for sick,
[1:36:06] you'll get your members here, get your
[1:36:08] letter from the church when you when you
[1:36:10] come back." So her daddy was a deacon in
[1:36:12] the church and so he couldn't. He he
[1:36:15] couldn't. So he asked me, he said,
[1:36:16] "Brother Hall said, if I go over there
[1:36:20] and
[1:36:22] uh asked if I'd go over there and and I
[1:36:25] said, sure." Her mother and father said,
[1:36:27] "Well, to satisfy her, all right, but I
[1:36:30] won't even wouldn't even stay in the
[1:36:32] house where those hypocrites were, that
[1:36:34] hypocrite was." So, I went down there
[1:36:36] and I looked in the house and and and if
[1:36:39] you ever passing through there, look
[1:36:41] like a look at the bed. Her little bed
[1:36:43] there, little iron bed, the paint's all
[1:36:45] wore off. She she kept it. She keeps it
[1:36:48] there. uh uh where where ye the through
[1:36:51] the years of holding with her hands
[1:36:53] crying and and her little legs up here
[1:36:55] and were approximately about that big
[1:36:57] around her arms couldn't raise this
[1:37:00] sputum cup where she was coughing and
[1:37:03] she'd go brother Madam makes a noise to
[1:37:05] imitate the coughing sound and and
[1:37:07] they'd raise up the sputum cup and she'd
[1:37:09] go make a make a noise to imitate
[1:37:12] it and you you could have to get down
[1:37:16] real close to hear a little pink sucking
[1:37:20] uh uh lips way eyes way back. She
[1:37:23] couldn't raise her hands up no more. And
[1:37:25] I noticed my little book laying on the
[1:37:27] bed, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday,
[1:37:29] today, and forever. And I said, "Little
[1:37:31] sister," I said, "I wish I could help
[1:37:33] you in some way, but are you a
[1:37:34] Christian?" She said, "I am." Her mother
[1:37:37] wasn't there. And they couldn't even
[1:37:38] couldn't even have a bed pan under her.
[1:37:41] They had to use a draw sheet. She
[1:37:43] couldn't even raise her up. She was just
[1:37:46] laying there just bones. She hadn't seen
[1:37:48] the outdoors for years and years and so
[1:37:50] a nice family of people. Her mother
[1:37:52] young practically yet was just
[1:37:55] gay-headed, shaking with pausy from
[1:37:57] setting day and night with that child
[1:38:00] setting there until she until she died.
[1:38:03] And they gave her up years and years and
[1:38:06] she had TB to come into the fam female
[1:38:08] organs and it went all through her body
[1:38:10] and she just in horrible shape. I said,
[1:38:13] "I will pray for you." So I knelt down
[1:38:15] and prayed and she wanted to know if
[1:38:17] something why didn't something happen
[1:38:20] and she had read in the paper about the
[1:38:21] nail girl and had been crippled and the
[1:38:23] papers packed all over the country and
[1:38:26] well now look sister dear that was a
[1:38:28] vision. I I can only do that. I I can
[1:38:30] pray for you. But that was a vision. I I
[1:38:33] didn't even know the girl and and and
[1:38:35] the tears where where she got enough
[1:38:37] moisture to get tears. I don't know. But
[1:38:39] tears came running down her side of her
[1:38:41] face. And you know how those meats going
[1:38:44] over the face, the jaw sunk in, poor
[1:38:47] little fella. And I said, "I will
[1:38:48] continue to pray for you." And because I
[1:38:51] know your father and mother don't want
[1:38:53] me here. And she started crying and
[1:38:55] whispered. She said, "But I do." And and
[1:38:58] so brother Bradom goes on preaching the
[1:39:00] the the revival. And and uh after after
[1:39:04] the Sunday morning service, had a little
[1:39:06] bapt baptism. And he says, "So I went
[1:39:08] with brother George right to eat
[1:39:10] supper." And he said, "Now, now he kind
[1:39:12] of talks country." And he said, "Now,
[1:39:14] Brother Billy," he said, "when mammy
[1:39:16] rings the bell, you come on." I said,
[1:39:18] "All right." I got over in the woods and
[1:39:20] I started to kneel down and the green
[1:39:22] briars were was sticking me. You know,
[1:39:24] you know when a blessing is right ahead
[1:39:26] of you, how the devil tempts you. and he
[1:39:28] tried to I tried to kneel this way and
[1:39:30] the brier stuck me and I got up went
[1:39:32] over here and the sun was shining on me
[1:39:34] and I'd go different places and directly
[1:39:36] I just got so wore out I just fell down
[1:39:38] and started screaming out to the Lord
[1:39:40] with all of my voice and praying. I
[1:39:42] think sometime that's a good idea. Well,
[1:39:45] well, but I tried I tried and I couldn't
[1:39:47] get it. Well, God must not No, it wasn't
[1:39:49] God. That's just you. That's just the
[1:39:51] devil trying to keep you from
[1:39:52] surrendering. That's just the devil
[1:39:54] trying to keep you out of a blessing.
[1:39:56] That's just the devil trying to keep you
[1:39:58] out of victory in your life. You stay
[1:40:01] right with it and keep on. Don't let
[1:40:02] that devil win in your
[1:40:04] life.
[1:40:06] Amen. The devil knew that a miracle was
[1:40:10] fixing to happen and he was trying to
[1:40:12] keep brother Brandham. Amen. From that
[1:40:14] miracle. He says, "Now," he said, "So I
[1:40:18] I I just fell down and started screaming
[1:40:20] out to the Lord with all of my voice and
[1:40:21] praying." Well, seemed like in the
[1:40:23] distance I could hear the bell, but I
[1:40:25] was just, you know, I I was you ever
[1:40:27] carried away in prayer like that. I just
[1:40:30] didn't pay any attention to it. After a
[1:40:31] while, I kind of got to myself and it
[1:40:34] was getting dusky and the sun setting
[1:40:36] over the hill getting down into the
[1:40:38] valley where I was was was was on the
[1:40:40] side of the hill that way. And I was and
[1:40:43] I was under a dog bush, a dog wood
[1:40:46] bushes, some dogwood bushes. And I
[1:40:48] looked up and I thought a a strange
[1:40:50] feeling was there. And I looked up and
[1:40:51] the light that you see in the picture
[1:40:52] was shining down through that and the
[1:40:54] circle the light was circling in the top
[1:40:56] of the dog wood bush. And he said, "Go
[1:40:58] by the way of Carter's." That's the
[1:41:00] girl's name, Georgie. Carter. Well, I
[1:41:03] got up and started and then the hunt
[1:41:05] search and parties trying to find me.
[1:41:07] Down the hill I went running real fast,
[1:41:09] jumped right into the arms of Brother
[1:41:10] Wright. He said, "Ma'am, he's had them
[1:41:12] biscuits ready for two hours, Brother
[1:41:14] Billy." I said, "Brother George,
[1:41:15] something's going to happen. You know
[1:41:17] that light that appeared down there
[1:41:18] where I was baptizing?" He said, 'Yeah.
[1:41:21] I said it was over there in those woods
[1:41:23] and told me to go the way of Carter's. I
[1:41:26] believe the little girl is going to get
[1:41:27] well. So there there was some people
[1:41:29] there from Texas and they wanted to see
[1:41:31] it happen. So down we went and wow, you
[1:41:34] know, God works on both ends of the
[1:41:36] line. He says, "And that woman went in
[1:41:38] to pray. her her mother went in to pray
[1:41:40] and her little girl got to crying
[1:41:42] because she wanted she had wanted seen
[1:41:44] the baptismal service advertised in the
[1:41:46] paper or announced and she wanted to to
[1:41:49] go to it and of course she couldn't
[1:41:50] move. He couldn't move for nine years
[1:41:53] and eight months and she was laying
[1:41:55] there crying and oh it got her mother so
[1:41:57] bad and that now there's her mother's
[1:41:59] story. You ask and see her mother tell
[1:42:02] it the same way. She she went into the
[1:42:04] room and they lived in a lovely big home
[1:42:06] and her married daughter lived close to
[1:42:08] them and she knelt down and she said,
[1:42:10] "Dear heavenly father, we have served
[1:42:12] you and your church for years and
[1:42:14] there's my poor little dying daughter
[1:42:16] laying in there and that impostor
[1:42:18] William Brandom has come through here
[1:42:20] got the people all stirred up and that
[1:42:23] poor little thing laying in there. God
[1:42:26] reward that hypocrite of his iniquity.
[1:42:30] Hallelujah.
[1:42:31] Oh, but God was still going to hear a
[1:42:34] daughter's prayer. Come on now.
[1:42:37] Hallelujah. Amen. She said she that
[1:42:40] hypocrite of his iniquity just going on
[1:42:43] praying like that. She raised up and she
[1:42:45] seen a shadow on the wall and she
[1:42:47] thought it was her daughter coming. Now,
[1:42:48] here's her story. I can only quote her.
[1:42:51] She said it was a shadow of the Lord
[1:42:53] Jesus. She seen his beard. He said, "Why
[1:42:56] are you weeping? Who's that coming?" And
[1:42:59] she looked over and she seen me with
[1:43:01] this Bible over my heart coming in with
[1:43:04] two men following me. And she said, "Oh,
[1:43:07] how I I I've been asleep." And she had
[1:43:10] never seen a vision before. So she said,
[1:43:12] "I've been asleep." "Oh, something's
[1:43:14] wrong." She said, "What happened? I've
[1:43:16] lost my mind." And she went into the
[1:43:18] room and she said, "Georgie, I you know
[1:43:20] I" And then and then she appeared uh
[1:43:24] then she appeared a a door then she
[1:43:26] heard a door slam and here I was walking
[1:43:28] in me and two men just like that and she
[1:43:32] fainted. When I got to the door, I don't
[1:43:34] know what who opened the door, but I got
[1:43:36] in and it seemed like I I know this
[1:43:38] sounds a juvenile, but it seems like I
[1:43:40] was standing in the corner of the room
[1:43:41] like that and I was watching myself go
[1:43:43] over to that girl and there she was
[1:43:46] laying there, her little pale face, uh,
[1:43:48] pale looking face, and I said, "Sister
[1:43:50] Georgie Carter, Jesus Christ, who you
[1:43:53] love and has trusted, I has met me over
[1:43:58] yonder under a dogwood bush." Oh, I can
[1:44:01] still think of it. Something happens. I
[1:44:04] I I said he met me and he sent me that
[1:44:07] you might be healed. So, in the name of
[1:44:09] Jesus Christ, rise from up from that
[1:44:12] bed. Now, how's she going to do it? She
[1:44:14] hasn't moved for 9 years and 8 months.
[1:44:17] Her legs wasn't that much bigger than a
[1:44:21] broomstick. Here she How is she going to
[1:44:24] get the strength to raise the sputum
[1:44:26] box? How's how's she going to stand? She
[1:44:29] How? I don't know. But God who created
[1:44:32] the heaven and earth and this is his
[1:44:34] word and me his minister standing here.
[1:44:36] The girl sprang to the floor under the
[1:44:39] power of the Holy Ghost with her hands
[1:44:41] in the air. The two men was with me seen
[1:44:44] the skeleton standing there. Her legs
[1:44:46] were up up where her short gown uh was
[1:44:51] was on like that. Her little legs about
[1:44:54] that big around and her little arms like
[1:44:56] that and them up in the air. It scared
[1:44:59] them and they started screaming. Her
[1:45:01] mother raised up just getting out of her
[1:45:04] fainting spell and she fainted again.
[1:45:06] She she let out a great big scream. I
[1:45:09] turn around and her daughter come
[1:45:11] running over and people all over Miltown
[1:45:13] come running. Her father thought Georgie
[1:45:16] had died. He was crossing the bridge
[1:45:18] with a little bucket of milk in his hand
[1:45:19] and come in the barn across the way. He
[1:45:22] was also the superintendent of the big
[1:45:23] quarry there. He came up on up the road
[1:45:26] and thought his daughter had died and
[1:45:28] she was went out the yard and sat on the
[1:45:30] grass and blessed the grass and blessed
[1:45:32] the leaves on the tree. And when her
[1:45:34] father got there, the house was packed
[1:45:36] full of people. About 20 minutes later,
[1:45:38] she was sitting at the oldfashioned
[1:45:40] country organ playing Jesus keep me near
[1:45:43] the cross. There's the precious fountain
[1:45:45] free for all the healing stream that
[1:45:47] flows from Calvar's Mountain. She's been
[1:45:50] in the the pianist at the Miltown
[1:45:52] Baptist Church from that day. The night
[1:45:55] till this night now has never went to
[1:45:57] bed with anything less than to go to bed
[1:46:00] and go to sleep since Miss Georgie
[1:46:02] Carter, Miltown, Indiana. It was her
[1:46:05] darkest hour. Then Jesus come along. Oh,
[1:46:07] God have mercy. It's the darkest hour
[1:46:09] that this world's ever seen. Communism
[1:46:11] on every side. All kinds of isms
[1:46:13] everywhere. But thank God Jesus has come
[1:46:16] along with his Bible, with his truth,
[1:46:18] with his holy spirit. He's here tonight
[1:46:20] to do exceedingly abundantly above that
[1:46:23] we could think uh do or think. Amen. Can
[1:46:27] you say amen? Hallelujah.
[1:46:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's got to
[1:46:33] be an action. Your action calls for a
[1:46:37] response. So don't come to church and
[1:46:40] sit here now. And and and now some of
[1:46:41] you young people like this, you know,
[1:46:43] I'm just telling you, you're you're
[1:46:45] you're just it's you're you you you
[1:46:47] you offend God. And you elders, too, if
[1:46:50] you're guilty, but you offend God by
[1:46:53] just coming to church and sitting there
[1:46:55] as if you're not giving him any praise.
[1:46:57] You're not you you you you can't tell me
[1:46:59] you don't do that to your that that you
[1:47:02] don't show that uh that kind of
[1:47:04] affection to your girlfriends or your
[1:47:05] boyfriends or your whatever it is. If
[1:47:08] you love somebody, you want to express
[1:47:11] it. When you come to church and you love
[1:47:13] the Lord, you ought to have your hands
[1:47:16] up in the air because he's a lot better
[1:47:18] than your boyfriend or girlfriend. He's
[1:47:20] a lot better than than than anything
[1:47:22] else. There should be a love. And I wish
[1:47:24] all of our young people were here today
[1:47:26] to hear me preach this because if you're
[1:47:28] going to be anything with God and you're
[1:47:30] going to receive anything from God, you
[1:47:33] don't want to see miracle God doing a
[1:47:34] miracle for me. You want to experience
[1:47:37] miracles in your own life.
[1:47:39] And if there's any adults here that
[1:47:41] needs God, well, you don't demand things
[1:47:44] from God, you you're humble. You humble
[1:47:48] yourself.
[1:47:50] You don't go around acting like you're
[1:47:52] the big cheese, like you know
[1:47:53] everything.
[1:47:55] You need
[1:47:57] God. Humble yourself. Learn to cry out
[1:48:01] to him. Quit trying to do everything on
[1:48:03] your own. When the word's coming forth,
[1:48:06] don't sit there and and just listen to
[1:48:08] the preacher. Pull from that gift.
[1:48:14] She watered the messenger and she
[1:48:17] watered the power that brought the
[1:48:20] messenger.
[1:48:22] Can you say amen?
[1:48:25] See, there there's something about that.
[1:48:28] Amen. That that brings it
[1:48:34] You say we we we we we pray as if we're
[1:48:39] having to beg God for
[1:48:42] something. You
[1:48:45] see, there's that that's not the case at
[1:48:48] all. What what about what about the
[1:48:50] woman? What about the black woman that
[1:48:53] they're in
[1:48:54] Chicago? And she had been been praying
[1:48:57] for her son, asked for the boy, and and
[1:48:59] she was she said she's like the shootite
[1:49:01] woman. couldn't have the no baby. And
[1:49:03] then she had the baby and her husband
[1:49:04] died. And
[1:49:05] now the boy got up to be 18, 19 years
[1:49:08] old and went out and messing around and
[1:49:11] and and and and you know living living a
[1:49:15] a riotist life and now he's got the
[1:49:17] veneer disease and and and and this big
[1:49:20] old boy is laying in the bed dying.
[1:49:24] Doctors have came over and said, "We've
[1:49:26] done everything we can do. He's he's
[1:49:27] going to die." Amen. And she's praying.
[1:49:31] She's just praying. She said, "Lord, I'm
[1:49:34] like your shoot my
[1:49:36] woman. Surely you
[1:49:39] got it lied just
[1:49:46] somewhere. I'd like the shadow of my
[1:49:49] woman. Surely you
[1:49:51] got
[1:49:55] Elijah and she fell asleep.
[1:49:59] While she was praying, while
[1:50:03] she she seen in this in this dream, she
[1:50:08] seen herself out there in her front yard
[1:50:12] and a man coming with a tan suit and
[1:50:14] with a with a certain hat on that he was
[1:50:17] going to pray for her
[1:50:20] son. Now, she had a
[1:50:24] choice. She had a choice. Either she's
[1:50:27] going to stay in bed and keep all of her
[1:50:30] molly grubbing and crying and
[1:50:32] praying or she's going to be
[1:50:37] sensitive. On the other end, Brother
[1:50:40] Brandham
[1:50:42] is has his letters. He wrote some
[1:50:44] letters and taken him to the post
[1:50:48] office and and and was going to go back
[1:50:50] to the hotel and and go get and and go
[1:50:53] uh his flight was going to leave in two
[1:50:56] hours. And as he's getting up to go to
[1:50:58] go take his letters, he he uh he said
[1:51:02] the spirit of the Lord says he just felt
[1:51:04] something strange. So he he pulled off
[1:51:07] to the side and the Lord told him just
[1:51:08] walk this way. He goes, "Oh, I can't do
[1:51:11] I." But he said, "I just knew the
[1:51:13] presence of the Lord enough that I just
[1:51:15] follow the leader leadership." So, he's
[1:51:18] walking on down and he kept on walking
[1:51:19] through Memphis, walking on walking, and
[1:51:22] the Lord just says, "Keep walking." Now,
[1:51:25] he's walking down to the old the poor
[1:51:27] side of town. And he's coming on. He's
[1:51:30] looking at his watch and he thought, "Oh
[1:51:31] my." He said, "I I've been walking now
[1:51:34] for over an hour. I I still got my
[1:51:36] briefcase at the motel room. I'm going
[1:51:39] to miss my flight. I keep
[1:51:42] walking. And he just kept on following
[1:51:45] the
[1:51:47] Lord. He goes down into pass some
[1:51:50] shannies and over there in the black
[1:51:52] town. And as he's coming down, he pass
[1:51:55] this woman and he tips his
[1:51:57] hat to her, says, "Good
[1:52:04] morning." Woman leading over the leaning
[1:52:06] over the fence says, "Hello, Parson.
[1:52:12] He stopped.
[1:52:16] He said, "You know, I'm a person." He
[1:52:18] said, "Me knows you was coming."
[1:52:24] He said, "Lord showed me a dream. Told
[1:52:26] me you was coming. I've been out here
[1:52:28] all
[1:52:29] night." He reached over there, felt her
[1:52:32] back. It was all wet with dew.
[1:52:36] Oh, God.
[1:52:39] Oh God, I wish every one of us could
[1:52:42] catch that kind of a
[1:52:45] revelation that the love of God passes
[1:52:48] all understanding and our reverence and
[1:52:51] our love and devotion to
[1:52:55] him. I didn't tell the first part of the
[1:52:58] story. Brother Brandham, they had they
[1:53:00] they actually put Brother Brandham in
[1:53:02] the Peabody Motel layover because they
[1:53:05] something had happened and they had to
[1:53:06] keep him there for the night. God
[1:53:08] grounded the plane and everything for it
[1:53:10] to be
[1:53:12] there. He looked at her and he said,
[1:53:15] "Well," she told him the
[1:53:19] story. He said, "Well, I don't know if
[1:53:22] you've heard of me. My name is William
[1:53:25] Brandom." Nope. Well, I pray for the
[1:53:28] sick and he's she wasn't weren't
[1:53:31] interested in anything about none of
[1:53:32] that. None of that. He said, "You just
[1:53:34] come in here and
[1:53:37] pray." They walked in the door to this
[1:53:39] little
[1:53:42] shy. No carpets on the floor, nothing.
[1:53:44] Just but but they're on the wall. Said,
[1:53:47] "God bless this
[1:53:50] home." He said, "I've been in king's h
[1:53:54] palaces. I've been with great men." But
[1:53:56] he I've never felt more at home than in
[1:53:59] that home with that black lady and her
[1:54:01] son that
[1:54:05] day. Felt the feet. They
[1:54:10] were cool and
[1:54:13] sticky. He was saying, "Oh, mama. Oh,
[1:54:18] mama. I'm lost. Mama, where are you?
[1:54:20] Mama, I'm lost. Mama, I'm lost.
[1:54:24] Mama, where are you?
[1:54:27] He said, "Oh, she's he's been saying
[1:54:28] this for for days now. He hasn't woke
[1:54:31] up. He just keeps hollering this. He's
[1:54:35] he's he's like he's out on a sea and
[1:54:38] he's he's he he's just calling for
[1:54:41] help." Brother Brandham knelt down and
[1:54:43] he said, "Mama, won't you
[1:54:46] pray? You pray first." He said, "She,"
[1:54:48] when she began to pray, she said,
[1:54:51] "Oh, she knew how to pray. She had
[1:54:54] prayed before and glory of the Lord
[1:54:56] coming down. And he knelt down and he
[1:54:58] said, "Lord, I don't know what this is
[1:55:00] about. You've not given me a
[1:55:02] vision. You've not given me anything.
[1:55:04] All I know is my plane was grounded and
[1:55:07] you told me to walk this way. I just
[1:55:09] felt your spirit saying to
[1:55:12] come. I don't know. I have no vision to
[1:55:15] go with, but this woman's faith. I'm
[1:55:17] asking that you would honor it."
[1:55:21] He said, "Heal the boy,
[1:55:24] Lord." All of a sudden, it started,
[1:55:27] "Mama, it's getting light in
[1:55:29] here. It's getting light. Mama, mama,
[1:55:33] getting light,
[1:55:35] mama." Then he opened his
[1:55:38] eyes. Well, glory to
[1:55:44] God. Oh, glory to
[1:55:49] God. Amen.
[1:55:51] He he he's he's he
[1:55:54] said, "Let me get let me get down to the
[1:55:57] parties where he had
[1:55:59] went." He says, "I he said,
[1:56:04] I" He said, "Mommy, it's getting it's
[1:56:06] getting light in him." In in less than
[1:56:08] five minutes, the big boy was setting up
[1:56:10] on the side of the glor of the bed
[1:56:11] giving glory to God. I struck back quick
[1:56:14] to the plane, got me a cab. When I when
[1:56:16] I got there two hours and something
[1:56:18] late, they were just making the last
[1:56:19] call. Talk about sovereign grace. The
[1:56:22] faith of that ignorant colored woman
[1:56:26] grounded that plain and and held it
[1:56:28] there. My when I think of those things
[1:56:30] and the many things I've seen, I think
[1:56:32] how rich, how pure, how fathomless, the
[1:56:35] strong and strong the love of God is for
[1:56:38] a poor, insignificant, peasant,
[1:56:40] ignorant. Uh you you a colored woman.
[1:56:43] Her prayers grounded that plane and held
[1:56:46] it there and sent me down there to pray
[1:56:48] for that boy. A year later, I was making
[1:56:50] a a trip to Phoenix by train as as you
[1:56:53] go into Memphis. You go into the station
[1:56:56] like that and I stopped and sandwiches
[1:56:58] on the train was was too high for me
[1:57:00] about 3040 cents a piece and I can get a
[1:57:03] hamburger for 15. So I jumped off the
[1:57:05] train, started running up that way to
[1:57:06] get me a hamburger while the train was
[1:57:08] waiting. My little red cap ran out there
[1:57:11] and said, "Hello there, Parson Brandom."
[1:57:14] And I said, "How do you do?" And he
[1:57:15] said, "You don't know me." He said,
[1:57:18] "You, oh, don't you know me?" And I
[1:57:20] said, "I don't believe I do, son." He
[1:57:22] said, 'You remember the morning that you
[1:57:24] came to my house and I was dying? I
[1:57:27] said, 'You're not that boy. Yes, Parson
[1:57:30] Brandon, I was healed and I was a
[1:57:32] Christian
[1:57:39] now. Brother, the spirit of God leads if
[1:57:43] you're expecting him to do it. just as
[1:57:46] great tonight as he was then and will
[1:57:48] forever will be forever. He said, "Let
[1:57:51] us let us pray. I wish I could sing just
[1:57:54] now. Oh, I wouldn't I would love to
[1:57:57] sing, oh love of God, how rich and pure
[1:58:00] God's no respective person, how poor,
[1:58:03] how ignorant, that doesn't matter. It's
[1:58:05] if you're expecting him and God will
[1:58:07] lead you to him." Can you say,
[1:58:12] "Amen?" Amen.
[1:58:16] Oh, glory to
[1:58:18] God. I want to give him
[1:58:21] water and I want to water his power with
[1:58:26] us.
[1:58:28] Now, what are we
[1:58:31] watering? We're watering the
[1:58:33] word. That's what we're giving water to
[1:58:37] Christ. Amen.
[1:58:41] Now, we must not think of ourselves too
[1:58:44] highly. And I know I've kept you a long
[1:58:45] time this morning and and and the
[1:58:47] musicians can
[1:58:51] come. Lofty-minded people will sit in
[1:58:54] church and not receive anything of the
[1:58:57] Lord. And I want to tell you, poor
[1:59:00] people can be the worst.
[1:59:10] You get a guy that that's trying to
[1:59:13] trying to do something and he might not
[1:59:16] have two quarters to rub together and
[1:59:18] yet he'll he'll act like he's just some
[1:59:21] kind of a big just putting on the air
[1:59:23] just putting on the big the big
[1:59:29] air. Brother Brandon would talk about
[1:59:31] it. He he he would say he says those he
[1:59:33] says those little guys that don't have
[1:59:35] But
[1:59:36] they they got a suit
[1:59:40] and look
[1:59:42] good. He says he says they they they
[1:59:45] cause me more problems
[1:59:46] than than the other guys lots of
[1:59:50] times. He because they they think highly
[1:59:53] of themselves. He said whereas he's
[1:59:56] found he's found great men to be very
[2:00:01] humble.
[2:00:03] But what he was what he was dealing
[2:00:05] with, he says, "But when you come before
[2:00:06] God, you you've got to lose your
[2:00:08] persona. You gota because us us poor
[2:00:13] folks." Y'all like my new
[2:00:15] suit? As poor
[2:00:19] folks, we want to look good.
[2:00:23] Everyone knows we ain't got no money in
[2:00:25] the bank, but the
[2:00:30] persona and we'll do that when we come
[2:00:32] into
[2:00:35] church. We're just satisfied
[2:00:38] with fitting in with the
[2:00:46] crowd. It's not in fitting in with the
[2:00:48] crowd, it's fitting in with his spirit.
[2:00:56] No matter what is required, if I have to
[2:00:58] scream and beg, if I have to beat an
[2:01:00] altar till I'm I've got snot all over
[2:01:02] the altar, my hands are are bleeding
[2:01:05] from pounding and I whatever it takes, I
[2:01:08] I
[2:01:10] I want to surrender everything that I
[2:01:12] am, I
[2:01:14] must. It's either surrender or I die.
[2:01:19] I can't
[2:01:23] live without your
[2:01:26] presence. I need
[2:01:34] you. Did you
[2:01:38] know? And I I I think this is important
[2:01:41] this that I'm fixing to read to you
[2:01:43] because with brother Brandham bringing a
[2:01:46] prophet and being able to discern and
[2:01:49] see
[2:01:50] things and when he preached the message
[2:01:52] in 63, this is after the seals and he's
[2:01:55] and he's and he's preaching a message
[2:01:57] entitled How can I overcome?
[2:02:02] He says, "It's been said so much that
[2:02:04] God is such a good God until they try to
[2:02:07] make God just a big doty
[2:02:11] grandfather." But he is not. He is a
[2:02:14] father, a father of righteousness, a
[2:02:16] father of
[2:02:17] correction. Love is always corrective.
[2:02:20] Love corrects. No matter how bad it
[2:02:23] hurts, it still
[2:02:24] corrects. A real mother will correct her
[2:02:27] children. A real dad will correct. And
[2:02:30] if you just get soft and doy. I was
[2:02:34] crossing over an old crossing an old log
[2:02:37] the other
[2:02:37] day down a a wash, what is called a
[2:02:41] hollow. And I jumped up on this log and
[2:02:46] on the outside it looked good. Looked
[2:02:48] like a big old beach log. But when I
[2:02:51] jumped on it, a great big jump chunk of
[2:02:53] it fell off. It was real rotten and
[2:02:56] dirty.
[2:02:58] That's the way Christians are
[2:03:01] becoming. They've been dead in sin and
[2:03:04] trespass so long till they become dirty.
[2:03:06] They can hold no weight at
[2:03:08] all. They know, they don't know what the
[2:03:12] overcoming
[2:03:13] means. I begin to think of this text
[2:03:16] then overcome. Keep the life in
[2:03:19] you. When the life went out, that's what
[2:03:23] brought that log to that condition.
[2:03:26] It made it worse than it ever than ever
[2:03:30] when it laid in the branch where the
[2:03:32] water was. Then you take a Christian
[2:03:34] that's supposed to be a Christian and
[2:03:36] let the life of God go from him. The
[2:03:38] experience, the joy of serving Christ,
[2:03:41] living in a church where such is going
[2:03:44] on, he rottens twice as
[2:03:48] quick, right? Living right under it.
[2:03:53] So if I if we are trying to follow the
[2:03:56] message of the hour, at least this part
[2:03:58] of the message, we should live
[2:04:00] constantly in the life of Christ because
[2:04:02] if you don't, you lay
[2:04:04] around. You know these things you're
[2:04:06] supposed to do and you don't do it. The
[2:04:09] Bible says he that knoweth to do good
[2:04:11] and don't do it to him at sin. Then you
[2:04:14] become doy and
[2:04:16] rotten. You're separated from the life
[2:04:19] of God.
[2:04:21] So strive with all that is in you. Stay
[2:04:25] in the life of
[2:04:27] Christ that you would be fruit bearing.
[2:04:32] Can you say amen?
[2:04:37] living, being a part of a church where
[2:04:40] the presence of the Lord
[2:04:43] is and
[2:04:49] rotten
[2:04:52] because the hardness of heart is not
[2:04:54] allowing us to follow and water the
[2:05:00] word. Watering
[2:05:05] Water him in our praise. Water him in
[2:05:07] our prayer.
[2:05:14] Watering. You say,
[2:05:19] "Well, I thought it's got to be God. I
[2:05:21] thought we're predestinated." Yes.
[2:05:25] Yes. And you're to take that very
[2:05:28] seriously.
[2:05:39] Job 11 and 12 says, "For vain man would
[2:05:41] be
[2:05:43] wise, though man be born like a wild
[2:05:46] ass's
[2:05:47] coat, if thou prepare thine heart, and
[2:05:50] stretch out thine hands toward him." So
[2:05:53] a vain man a vain man will be wise,
[2:05:56] though he's as wild as a donkey.
[2:05:59] A vain man will be
[2:06:02] wise if you would prepare your
[2:06:06] heart. Stretch out your hands toward
[2:06:12] him.
[2:06:16] Amen. If iniquity be in thy hand, put it
[2:06:18] far from thee. Let not wickedness dwell
[2:06:20] in thy
[2:06:21] tabernacles. For then shalt thou lift up
[2:06:24] thy face without spot.
[2:06:27] Yay, thou shalt be
[2:06:29] steadfast and shall not
[2:06:35] fear. Isaiah 55 and6 says, "Seek the
[2:06:38] Lord while he may be
[2:06:40] found and call upon his
[2:06:45] name. If he's at the
[2:06:49] whale, don't let me entertain him."
[2:06:56] Can you say
[2:06:59] amen? You
[2:07:04] see, Jesus says, "The day that I'm
[2:07:06] revealed, you will know
[2:07:09] me. You will know
[2:07:16] me." And I want you to look at I've got
[2:07:18] I've got just a few scriptures I want to
[2:07:20] read real fast to you. And I want you to
[2:07:22] catch
[2:07:23] this. Catch, catch what? Catch what
[2:07:26] God's what's in God's mind. Look, look,
[2:07:27] look at where he's at. Look, look at
[2:07:29] him. Look, this is what he's
[2:07:31] pronouncing. He says, "The Lord shall
[2:07:33] send the rod." Psalms 11:0 and two, "The
[2:07:36] Lord shall send the rod of thy strength
[2:07:37] out of Zion. Rule thou in the midst of
[2:07:40] thine enemies." Now, the Lord is sending
[2:07:42] the rod of
[2:07:44] strength for us to rule. Thy people
[2:07:46] shall be willing in the day of thy
[2:07:50] power and the beauties of holiness from
[2:07:52] the womb of the morning
[2:07:54] thou hast the dw of thy
[2:07:58] youth. Philippians 2 and
[2:08:01] 12. Wherefore, my brethren, as ye have
[2:08:03] always obeyed, not as in my presence
[2:08:05] only, but now much more in my absence,
[2:08:08] work out your own salvation with fear
[2:08:09] and trembling. For it is God which
[2:08:12] workketh in you both to
[2:08:14] will and to
[2:08:17] do of his good pleasure. Now are you
[2:08:20] catching it? The day of my power my
[2:08:22] people will be
[2:08:23] willing. The day of my power there's
[2:08:26] there that there's going to be I I'm
[2:08:28] coming and I am giving that I am giving
[2:08:31] you whatever is
[2:08:34] required. I'm here.
[2:08:38] I'm here. But I want you to recognize
[2:08:41] it. Work out your own salvation. For it
[2:08:43] is God that wills and do and does.
[2:08:48] Isaiah 1:19. If you be willing and
[2:08:51] obedient, you shall eat the good of the
[2:08:53] land. But if you refuse and rebel, you
[2:08:57] shall be devoured with a sword. For the
[2:08:59] mouth of the Lord has spoken it. Psalms
[2:09:02] 278. When thou saidest, "Seek my
[2:09:07] face," my heart said unto thee, "Thy
[2:09:13] face, Lord, will I
[2:09:16] seek." Can you say,
[2:09:19] "Amen." You see
[2:09:22] that? And all of these scriptures that
[2:09:24] we have said, it's not that we're having
[2:09:26] to pray the power down.
[2:09:36] Tune my heart
[2:09:39] up. Can you say
[2:09:41] amen? Tune my
[2:09:45] heart. Tune me up.
[2:09:51] I came in once one service for my for my
[2:09:54] in-ear monitors and
[2:09:57] man they weren't working. So I ran I ran
[2:10:01] up to brother Nathaniel and and then
[2:10:04] they was they was working finally found
[2:10:06] out
[2:10:08] that I had hit I hit a button here on my
[2:10:12] on my side and I wasn't in the same
[2:10:13] channel. So, it was all just real
[2:10:16] static. And I'm thinking, "Oh no, man.
[2:10:17] My my monitors went
[2:10:20] dead. After
[2:10:23] I fixed my little device up, I could
[2:10:26] hear
[2:10:28] again." Praise the Lord. Well, wasn't
[2:10:31] this one of the strangest, weirdest
[2:10:33] messages you've ever
[2:10:35] heard?
[2:10:41] Amen. Bless the Lord.
[2:10:45] God works on both
[2:10:48] ends. God works on both
[2:10:53] ends.
[2:10:55] No, no, it's not
[2:11:00] God. God sent his messenger to
[2:11:05] us. The anointing is here. And I'm going
[2:11:07] to
[2:11:09] water. I'm going to water the word and
[2:11:12] that
[2:11:16] anointing. And that word and that
[2:11:18] anointing is the power that's going to
[2:11:21] take me into a
[2:11:25] rapture. I want to surrender. And I I I
[2:11:27] I if there's if there's someone here
[2:11:29] today that says, "Brother Windle, I've
[2:11:31] given my heart to the Lord, but I've not
[2:11:36] surrendered." It it's it's it's it's the
[2:11:39] it's
[2:11:42] It's that something on the inside that
[2:11:44] is screaming
[2:11:47] out that I need you so
[2:11:53] much.
[2:11:59] Reason the reason you've brought me
[2:12:03] here is because you love me.
[2:12:10] The reason I'm in this church service
[2:12:12] here this
[2:12:13] morning is because you love
[2:12:18] me. You must love me
[2:12:21] because you moved upon the preacher to
[2:12:25] preach this sermon for me to hear this
[2:12:28] morning.
[2:12:36] I want to take his yoke upon me. I want
[2:12:38] to learn of him.
[2:12:39] Amen. God bless
[2:12:43] you. Kobe, can we sing that that that
[2:12:46] old
[2:12:49] song? I surrender all.
[2:12:53] I
[2:12:56] surrender
[2:13:01] all.

[2:13:15] [Music]
[2:13:16] blessed
[2:13:18] Savior,
[2:13:20] I
[2:13:23] surrender. Is that your prayer here this
[2:13:26] morning? Oh,
[2:13:30] I
[2:13:32] surrender.
[2:13:34] Oh, I surrender, Lord.
[2:13:38] I

[2:13:47] all to
[2:13:52] thee. Oh, I

[2:14:10] me. I don't want no
[2:14:15] crutches. I don't want a
[2:14:17] crutch. Well,
[2:14:20] I I'll serve you as long as I got this
[2:14:24] crutch. I I I'll serve you as long as
[2:14:28] I I'm burning my bridges.

[2:14:40] my heart. I need
[2:14:42] you. I want to love you because I really
[2:14:46] love you. Not because I want
[2:14:48] circumstances to go a certain
[2:14:52] way. I'm not going to say I'll serve you
[2:14:54] if you do this and you do that. No,
[2:14:59] I'm going to hell if
[2:15:04] Everything about
[2:15:05] me lost if I don't have
[2:15:08] [Music]
[2:15:11] you. I don't want to even sit in a pew
[2:15:16] and be a church
[2:15:20] member. That's not what you've called me
[2:15:22] to be. That's not the design that you
[2:15:24] have.
[2:15:28] I want to
[2:15:29] water. I want to water your word.
[2:15:33] I want to
[2:15:34] water your power.
[2:15:39] I love you, Lord. Wash me.
[2:15:45] Cleanse my heart.

[2:16:24] intentions.

[2:16:29] Lord. I love you, Lord Jesus. I love
[2:16:33] you, Lord Jesus.
[2:16:38] Oh God, we thank you, Father.
[2:16:43] Oh yes.
[2:16:47] Is there anyone else that needs to be
[2:16:50] kneeling in reverence before God
[2:16:53] today? Is there anyone else that needs
[2:16:56] to be saying,
[2:17:00] "Lord, I want to humble my heart toward
[2:17:05] you. I want you to know who I am. I want
[2:17:08] you to know that I love you.
[2:17:13] I want to surrender everything I am to
[2:17:17] you. I want your grace to be upon
[2:17:24] me. I need you more than I need breath.

[2:28:04] good. I did right at the start.
