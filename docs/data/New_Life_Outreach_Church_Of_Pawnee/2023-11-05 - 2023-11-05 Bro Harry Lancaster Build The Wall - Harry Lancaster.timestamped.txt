[43:18] Christ we pray
[43:22] amen all right let's go ahead and turn
[43:25] to
[43:26] Isaiah chapter
[43:36] 62 it's good to see everybody here on
[43:39] Sunday
[43:42] morning we're missing a a few but seems
[43:45] like we're starting to get back up to
[43:47] almost full again starting to get
[43:49] everybody back from their various
[43:55] trips so Isaiah chapter
[44:01] 62 we'll start at verse
[44:05] 6 I have set Watchmen upon thy walls oh
[44:09] Jerusalem which shall never hold their
[44:11] peace day nor night ye that make mention
[44:14] of the Lord keep not silence and give
[44:17] him no rest till he establish until he
[44:20] make Jerusalem a praise in the
[44:23] earth now let's turn to Jude chapter
[44:43] 1 and starting at verse
[44:47] three beloved when I gave all diligence
[44:50] to write unto you of the common
[44:52] salvation it was needful for me to write
[44:54] unto you and exhort you that you should
[44:57] earnestly contend for the faith which
[44:59] was once delivered unto the Saints for
[45:01] there are certain men crept in unawares
[45:03] who were before of old ordained to this
[45:06] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[45:08] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[45:11] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[45:13] Jesus Christ you all may have your
[45:19] seats brother random said in the sermon
[45:22] the faith that was once delivered to the
[45:23] Saints he says but now Jude told us to
[45:26] contend for the faith the faith not a
[45:29] faith the faith that was once delivered
[45:32] to the Saints now there's only one
[45:34] sensible way to do that isn't it friends
[45:36] that's to go right back and find out
[45:38] what kind of Faith they had and then
[45:40] when we find what kind of Faith they had
[45:41] then earnestly contend for
[45:47] that brother Wendell's been preaching
[45:51] the last several sermons on the god-
[45:54] called preacher and
[45:56] Wednesday as he was uh ministering and
[46:00] talking about Watchmen on the
[46:03] walls I began to think a little bit
[46:07] about
[46:08] uh for some reason the the the history
[46:12] of Nehemiah began to to come into my
[46:14] mind and so I
[46:16] started going back and reading through
[46:19] that again and so let's go ahead and
[46:20] turn to Nehemiah chapter
[46:24] 1
[46:29] Nehemiah chapter 1 and we'll start at
[46:31] verse
[46:42] one the words of Nehemiah the son of
[46:45] hakal and it came to pass in the month
[46:48] chisu in the 20th year as I was in
[46:51] shushan the palace that Hannah and I one
[46:54] of my brethren came he and certain men
[46:56] of Judah and I asked them concerning the
[46:59] Jews that had escaped which were left of
[47:01] the Captivity and concerning Jerusalem
[47:04] and they said unto me the remnant that
[47:05] are left of the Captivity there in the
[47:07] province are in great Affliction and
[47:10] reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is
[47:12] broken down and the gates thereof are
[47:14] burned with fire and it came to pass
[47:17] when I heard these words that I sat down
[47:19] and wept and mourned certain days and
[47:22] fasted and prayed before the god of
[47:25] Heaven
[47:29] the city of Jerusalem when you go back
[47:32] through the history had been a hold out
[47:35] until the time of David it had been
[47:38] occupied by the
[47:39] jebusites The Tribe of Benjamin Had
[47:41] failed to drive them out and allowed the
[47:43] enemy to live in their midst and because
[47:46] the city was not owned by any of the
[47:49] tribes of Israel it was a perfect
[47:51] location to represent the united nation
[47:55] of is Israel as David was coming in as
[47:57] king it was one of the reasons that he
[48:00] went after the city was because of its
[48:02] location and because that he was not
[48:04] going to be saying that hey this tribe
[48:06] is a little bit better than anyone else
[48:08] because this is where I'm putting my
[48:09] Capital he took the city that no one had
[48:12] a claim to and went okay now this is
[48:15] going to be the Royal City this is going
[48:17] to be the place that we take we're going
[48:19] to take this city which as we know uh
[48:22] brother Brandon brought out and talked
[48:24] about the fact that Jerusalem means the
[48:26] city of peace and so David came in and
[48:29] takes the city of Jerusalem and
[48:32] establishes that and from that time on
[48:35] that was where the the ruling of of the
[48:39] United Israel and then of Judah happened
[48:42] was in Jerusalem this was this was where
[48:45] uh the heart of the land basically was
[48:48] um and this was the city of
[48:51] Peace but as Israel went down and they
[48:54] continued to to reject God over time and
[48:58] eventually it came to the time
[49:00] that the city was going to be destroyed
[49:03] because they were going to be driven out
[49:05] they were going to be taken
[49:07] away we turn to 2 Kings chapter
[49:12] 24 and starting at verse
[49:15] 10 it says at that time the Servants of
[49:18] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came up
[49:20] against Jerusalem and the city was
[49:22] besieged and Nebuchadnezzar King of
[49:25] Babylon
[49:26] came against the city and his servants
[49:27] did besiege it and jein the king of
[49:30] Judah went out to the king of Babylon he
[49:32] and his mother and his servants and his
[49:34] princes and his officers and the king of
[49:36] Babylon took him in the eighth year of
[49:38] his Reign and he carried out then all
[49:41] the Treasures of the house of the Lord
[49:42] and the Treasures of the King's house
[49:44] and cut in pieces all the vessels of
[49:45] gold which Solomon king of Israel had
[49:47] made in the temple of the Lord as the
[49:49] Lord had said and he carried away all
[49:52] Jerusalem and all the princes and all
[49:53] the Mighty Men of Valor even 10 10,000
[49:56] captives and all the Craftsmen and
[49:58] Smiths none remained save the poorest
[50:00] sword of the people of the land and he
[50:02] carried away jein to Babylon and the
[50:05] King's mother and the King's wives and
[50:07] his officers and the mighty of the land
[50:10] those carried he into captivity from
[50:12] Jerusalem to Babylon and all the men of
[50:15] might even 7,000 and Craftsmen and
[50:18] Smiths a thousand and all that were
[50:21] strong and apt for war even them the
[50:24] king of Babylon brought captive to
[50:32] Babylon in Jeremiah 29:1 it says for
[50:35] thus sayeth the Lord that after 70 years
[50:37] be accomplished at Babylon I will visit
[50:39] you and perform my good word toward you
[50:41] and causing you to return to this
[50:44] place so according to history it was 586
[50:47] BC when Jerusalem was destroyed and the
[50:50] temple was
[50:51] burned and for 70 years they were gone
[50:56] from the land for 70 years they were in
[51:00] captivity in 516 BC according to
[51:07] history Israelites began to return we
[51:12] find this uh recounted in in Ezra if we
[51:16] turn to Ezra chapter
[51:18] 1 Ezra chapter 1 and just starting at
[51:21] verse one it says now in the first year
[51:23] of Cyrus King of Persia the that the
[51:25] word of the Lord by the mouth of
[51:27] Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord
[51:29] stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of
[51:31] Persia that he made a proclamation
[51:33] throughout all his kingdom and put it
[51:35] also in writing saying thus saith Cyrus
[51:37] King of Persia the Lord God Of Heaven
[51:39] hath given me all the kingdoms of the
[51:41] earth and he hath charged me to build
[51:43] him in House at Jerusalem which is in
[51:44] Judah who is there among you of all his
[51:46] people his God be with him and let him
[51:48] go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and
[51:51] build the house of the Lord God of
[51:53] Israel he is the god which which is in
[51:55] Jerusalem and whosoever remaineth in any
[51:58] place where he sojourneth let the men of
[51:59] his place help him with silver and with
[52:01] gold and with goods and with Beast
[52:04] beside the Free Will offering for the
[52:06] house of God that is in isra that is in
[52:09] Jerusalem then rose up the chief of the
[52:11] fathers of Judah and Benjamin the
[52:13] priests and the Levites with all of them
[52:15] whose Spirit God had raised to go up and
[52:17] to build the house of Israel which is in
[52:21] Jerusalem and so in in 5:116 BC they go
[52:25] back and the temple is rebuilt and it's
[52:29] rededicated and so it was exactly as
[52:32] Jeremiah propes it was 70 years that the
[52:35] temple was destroyed and they were gone
[52:37] but then they return and they rebuild
[52:40] the
[52:42] Temple and they've come in with the mind
[52:45] to work to go okay we're going to we're
[52:47] going to restore things we're going to
[52:48] rebuild we're going to bring things back
[52:52] to way that they
[52:54] should
[52:56] and then in Ezra chter
[52:58] 4 and verse
[53:00] 11 said this is the copy of the letter
[53:03] that they sent unto him even unto erses
[53:06] the king thy servants the men on this
[53:09] side of the river and at such time be it
[53:10] known unto the king that the Jews which
[53:12] came up from thee to us are com into
[53:14] Jerusalem building the rebellious and
[53:17] the bad City and have set up the walls
[53:19] thereof and join the foundations be it
[53:21] known now unto the king that if this
[53:23] city be buil and the walls set up again
[53:26] that they will not pay toll tribute and
[53:29] custom and so Thou shalt end damage the
[53:32] revenue of the king now because we have
[53:34] maintenance from the king's Palace and
[53:36] it was not meat for us to see the king's
[53:38] dishonor there we have we sent and
[53:40] certify the king that search may be made
[53:43] in the book of the records of thy
[53:45] fathers so shalt thou find in the books
[53:47] of the records and know that this city
[53:49] is a rebellious City and hurtful unto
[53:51] Kings and provinces and that they have
[53:53] moved sedition Within the same of old
[53:56] time for which cause was this city
[53:59] destroyed let's drop down to verse
[54:02] 24 then ceased the work of the house of
[54:05] God which is at Jerusalem so it ceased
[54:08] until the second year of the reign of
[54:10] Darius King of
[54:12] Persia the people came in with a mind to
[54:16] rebuild not just the temple but
[54:18] Jerusalem and they rebuilt the temple
[54:21] they got it dedicated and then they
[54:22] turned to begin working on the walls now
[54:28] during this time the walls of a city was
[54:31] really the main defense normally there
[54:35] weren't huge armies in most of these
[54:38] countries because they didn't have the
[54:40] revenue
[54:42] to manage huge armies in fact a lot of
[54:45] those that were in the military would
[54:48] still have their own Farm they would
[54:50] still have their own land that they had
[54:52] to go and care for and so you can
[54:55] actually find historically that normally
[54:57] there was a raiding
[54:59] season which was when these men didn't
[55:03] have to be working their own farms and
[55:05] that was when you would go raid against
[55:07] the enemy but then when it was time for
[55:09] planting when it was getting time for
[55:11] Preparation they would go back and the
[55:13] Army would split back up across their
[55:16] own Homeland as they each man went to
[55:18] his own land his own Farm to
[55:22] work the Army wasn't always standing it
[55:25] wasn't always ready they could be called
[55:26] back up if necessary but they had their
[55:30] own land to take care of that was one of
[55:32] the ways that they were provided for and
[55:34] the King didn't have to worry about
[55:35] having quite as much
[55:37] finances because each one had his own
[55:39] land to provide the food that they
[55:41] needed and so raiding season was when
[55:45] you would be so worried about okay where
[55:48] are the armies are they coming this way
[55:50] do we have our own defenses but because
[55:53] you often didn't have huge armies around
[55:56] and you who knew how long it would take
[55:58] for communication to get anywhere to
[56:00] know that an army was even
[56:02] coming the place of safety was behind
[56:05] the
[56:06] walls and so having a place like the
[56:10] temple which
[56:13] had all these gold and artifacts and
[56:18] precious things that would be a great
[56:20] attraction to the
[56:22] Raiders the walls would be there to
[56:24] provide the security the walls would be
[56:26] there to provide the protection they
[56:28] would be there to keep you safe until
[56:31] the Army got tired and left or until you
[56:34] could get a message out to get your own
[56:36] Army to come to wherever you were at and
[56:39] so it would be very normal to hey we've
[56:41] come to rebuild the Temple the next step
[56:44] is rebuild the
[56:47] walls but yet the enemy was able to to
[56:51] step in and go no that
[56:55] that's that's not going to happen and so
[56:59] from the time that the temple was
[57:01] rebuilt and
[57:03] dedicated 61 years
[57:06] pass 61 years pass within the book of
[57:11] Ezra until finally Ezra himself gets
[57:16] ready to go to Jerusalem it's in 455 BC
[57:21] that Ezra leads a small group of 1500
[57:24] men and their families to
[57:29] Jerusalem let's turn to
[57:33] Ezra chapter
[57:40] 7 Ezra chapter 7 and we'll start at
[57:42] verse
[57:45] 11 now this is the copy of the letter
[57:48] that the king erses gave unto Ezra the
[57:51] priest The Scribe even a scribe of the
[57:53] words of the Commandment of the Lord and
[57:55] of his statutes to Israel
[57:58] erses King of Kings unto Ezra the priest
[58:01] a scribe of the law of the god of Heaven
[58:03] perfect peace and at such a time I make
[58:06] a decree that all the that all they of
[58:09] the people of Israel and of his priests
[58:11] and Levites in my realm which are minded
[58:14] of their own free will to go up to
[58:15] Jerusalem go with thee for as much as
[58:18] Thou Art sent of the king and of his
[58:20] seven counselors to inquire concerning
[58:22] Judah and Jerusalem according to the the
[58:24] law of thy God which is in thine hand
[58:27] and to carry the silver and gold which
[58:29] the king and his counselors have freely
[58:30] offered unto the god of Israel whose
[58:32] habitation is in Jerusalem and all the
[58:35] silver and gold that thou cast find in
[58:37] all the province of Babylon with the
[58:39] Free Will offering of the people and of
[58:41] the priests offering willingly for the
[58:43] house of their God which is in Jerusalem
[58:45] that thou mayest buy speedily with this
[58:47] money Bullocks Rams Lambs with their
[58:50] meat offerings and their drink offerings
[58:52] and offer them upon the altar of the
[58:54] House of your God which is in Jerusalem
[58:56] and whatsoever shall seem good to thee
[58:58] and to thy Brethren to do with the rest
[59:00] of the silver and gold that they that do
[59:03] after the will of your God the vessels
[59:05] also that are given thee for the service
[59:07] of the House of thy God those deliver
[59:09] thou before the god of
[59:10] Jerusalem and whatsoever more shall be
[59:14] needful for the house of thy God which
[59:16] Thou shalt have occasion to bestow
[59:18] bestow it out of the King's treasur
[59:22] house and so Ezra
[59:26] returns he leads this small
[59:30] group the temple has been there for for
[59:32] 61 years and when Ezra comes he finds
[59:36] some problems that needs to be
[59:37] straightened
[59:38] out and so once again the focus is on
[59:42] the temple and
[59:44] nothing happens with the
[59:49] walls
[59:53] so
[59:55] think about what this would have been
[59:57] like for those that are living in
[59:59] Jerusalem the people that are
[1:00:03] there the temple has been
[1:00:05] restored we
[1:00:08] have the worship we've had uh you know
[1:00:11] an inspired inspired men that came in
[1:00:13] that began to get things started Ezra
[1:00:15] comes in to help fix some things get
[1:00:17] things beginning to line up even more
[1:00:19] the way that they should
[1:00:22] be but yet they could didn't have a true
[1:00:25] feeling of peace or
[1:00:27] safety because they had no walls they
[1:00:30] had no
[1:00:33] protection imagine now for you know one
[1:00:36] of the the fathers getting up and going
[1:00:38] about his his Daily Business he could
[1:00:40] have been a a shopkeeper he could have
[1:00:43] been a
[1:00:44] Craftsman maybe he had a small plot of
[1:00:47] Farmland outside the the Broken Walls
[1:00:50] that he
[1:00:51] farmed who knows what it was but every
[1:00:53] day when he would get up up to to go
[1:00:55] about providing for his family he would
[1:00:58] see the Broken Walls and and the burned
[1:01:01] Gates every time every Sabbath when he
[1:01:04] would take his family to worship he
[1:01:07] would see the walls crumbling and
[1:01:10] cracked and see the big holes and the
[1:01:12] gaps he would see those Gates that were
[1:01:16] either just gone or charred and hanging
[1:01:19] off one hinge or or these different
[1:01:21] things
[1:01:22] he and even as they would enter into the
[1:01:25] temple to
[1:01:28] worship there would be that nagging
[1:01:30] thought in their back of their
[1:01:32] mind is this really
[1:01:37] mattering the enemy can walk right
[1:01:39] in at any
[1:01:42] time you know these were not when you
[1:01:45] look at the people that were being
[1:01:47] called to go back to Jerusalem a lot of
[1:01:49] them were falling in the priesthood a
[1:01:51] lot of them were falling into into these
[1:01:53] kind of lines these were not
[1:01:55] soldiers and Warriors and well-trained
[1:01:57] Fighters these were not men that were
[1:01:58] going oh we don't need a wall we can
[1:02:00] fight them off
[1:02:01] ourselves these were men that were going
[1:02:03] in and they felt called to do this and
[1:02:07] they had succeeded in getting the temple
[1:02:09] back they had succeeded in restoring
[1:02:13] worship the process was starting but yet
[1:02:16] even though they had restored
[1:02:19] worship they did not have their peace
[1:02:21] they did not have that sense of safety
[1:02:24] they did not have that that sense of
[1:02:27] protection that was there they had begun
[1:02:30] to worship they had begun to enter back
[1:02:34] in but can't you just see the enemy
[1:02:37] every time they would go in on the
[1:02:38] Sabbath to worship just putting in their
[1:02:40] mind what if a rating party comes in
[1:02:42] while we're
[1:02:43] here what if a raiding party attacks my
[1:02:46] family while I'm off at work what if a
[1:02:49] raiding party does this or does that
[1:02:53] there's no safety there's
[1:02:55] no
[1:02:58] peace just like the enemy likes to play
[1:03:00] in our minds today to try to get you to
[1:03:03] things but here they're going and it's
[1:03:04] everything is in the Physical Realm they
[1:03:06] go look I can see there's no safety I
[1:03:09] can see there's nothing to protect us
[1:03:12] here I can see we are in a weakened
[1:03:16] position we've begun the process we we
[1:03:19] have our worship back we've begun to set
[1:03:22] things in order we've begun to move the
[1:03:25] right
[1:03:29] direction but yet where is the
[1:03:31] protection where is the safety because
[1:03:35] the enemy stopped us we were about to
[1:03:38] work on the walls we were starting the
[1:03:41] process and the enemy was able to
[1:03:44] prevent us from building the
[1:03:47] walls and there are these men that are
[1:03:50] living there that they came to Jerusalem
[1:03:54] with the best of intentions they felt
[1:03:56] led they felt inspired they felt like
[1:03:59] this is where God was taking them to be
[1:04:02] they had done their part to put in the
[1:04:04] work to rebuild the Temple they had done
[1:04:06] their part to be part of this community
[1:04:08] and and begin to reestablish
[1:04:12] things but yet day after day they're
[1:04:15] walking
[1:04:16] through and they see the walls crumbling
[1:04:19] around
[1:04:20] them day after day they're going through
[1:04:23] and they're just
[1:04:26] feeling everything that the enemy is
[1:04:29] throwing at them everything going on in
[1:04:31] their mind everything that's going
[1:04:33] on and they're hearing stories about the
[1:04:38] governors that are around them and what
[1:04:40] kind of men these are and what kind of
[1:04:43] things they might be
[1:04:49] saying and it's as all this is going
[1:04:52] along you know um brother brand says in
[1:04:54] the sermon pardon he says God hates a
[1:04:57] powerless religion it's got to be power
[1:04:59] certainly it's a power to save man from
[1:05:01] sin it's a power that can do signs and
[1:05:03] wonders and miracles as Jesus Christ
[1:05:05] promised they zeroed in on the word of
[1:05:07] God back there and believed it and hit
[1:05:09] the target you zero the same way on the
[1:05:11] word of God it'll hit the target again
[1:05:13] it's got to because he's the same
[1:05:15] yesterday today and forever God don't
[1:05:17] like a powerless religion God doesn't
[1:05:19] want that God wants to perform God wants
[1:05:21] to show himself alive our very hope is
[1:05:24] the resurrection is that right our hopes
[1:05:26] of life is Resurrection the resurrection
[1:05:29] of Jesus
[1:05:31] Christ as the faithful would go to
[1:05:34] Worship in the temple that they had
[1:05:35] helped to rebuild I can just see the
[1:05:37] devil doing his best to put the fear in
[1:05:38] their mind to do his best to point out
[1:05:41] everything that hadn't been done
[1:05:43] everything that was preventing them from
[1:05:45] actually having the peace that Jerusalem
[1:05:48] was supposed to be
[1:05:50] providing it was just that that little
[1:05:53] nagging fear in their back of their mind
[1:05:55] that all of this was for
[1:05:57] not everything we had done was worthless
[1:06:01] in the end it didn't
[1:06:06] matter and Ezra had led that small group
[1:06:09] of men over and nine more years
[1:06:14] pass Jerusalem was destroyed and 70
[1:06:17] years later the next Temple was
[1:06:19] built and dedicated and then 70 more
[1:06:23] years pass
[1:06:25] a total of 70 years past with the walls
[1:06:28] still broken around
[1:06:31] them they've been worshiping they've
[1:06:34] been doing their best with what they
[1:06:38] have but
[1:06:40] yet they're still looked down upon by
[1:06:42] everyone around
[1:06:43] them because they don't have a place of
[1:06:47] safety anyone can walk in at any time
[1:06:50] and do whatever they want cuz these are
[1:06:52] not trained soldiers these are not
[1:06:54] people that are ready to to fight in
[1:06:56] every
[1:06:57] moment they're just men that felt
[1:07:02] led and the walls are still
[1:07:07] crumbling and I'm sure there were lots
[1:07:09] of them there were would sit there and
[1:07:11] there were probably been some of them
[1:07:12] that had been part of as they began to
[1:07:15] work on the walls and then got
[1:07:17] stopped and they would look over and go
[1:07:20] that was the last brick I laid I can
[1:07:23] still see it sitting
[1:07:27] there and we haven't been able to go any
[1:07:29] further we haven't been able to make any
[1:07:32] more
[1:07:39] progress as brother Wendell has been
[1:07:43] preaching about the Watchman on the
[1:07:48] wall as I said it made me think of of
[1:07:51] Nehemiah and so here's Nehemiah Maya and
[1:07:54] he finally hears the story he finally
[1:07:57] hears what's going on in
[1:08:00] Jerusalem and it immediately breaks his
[1:08:05] heart now obviously he knows one man by
[1:08:08] himself he cannot go in and physically
[1:08:10] rebuild every wall and every gate on his
[1:08:13] own that's not
[1:08:17] possible physically it cannot be done by
[1:08:19] a single
[1:08:21] man but yet he
[1:08:24] has the
[1:08:26] inspiration that okay this is a work
[1:08:28] that needs to be done and I'm close
[1:08:30] enough to the
[1:08:31] king to make the request for
[1:08:40] it brother brandom says in the sermon
[1:08:42] the way to have Fellowship he said
[1:08:43] there's only two faculties that govern a
[1:08:45] human one of them is Faith which brings
[1:08:48] results and the other is fear which has
[1:08:50] no value in it all faith is of God fear
[1:08:54] is of the devil fear Makes You Weary
[1:08:56] fear makes you wonder if I was and if I
[1:08:59] was going to die in the morning what
[1:09:01] good would it do me to get all stewed up
[1:09:03] about it what if I was going to be
[1:09:05] electrocuted in the morning and my life
[1:09:06] to end tomorrow morning what good would
[1:09:08] that do me to worry about it well you
[1:09:11] say what good would it do to have faith
[1:09:13] faith can sign my pardon sure there's
[1:09:15] value in faith don't be weary don't be
[1:09:17] scared don't be upset just have faith
[1:09:19] and believe and the only way you can
[1:09:20] have faith you have to have love first
[1:09:23] for love produces faith for perfect love
[1:09:26] get it perfect love casts out all
[1:09:31] fear the people that were in Jerusalem
[1:09:33] were fighting with the fear because all
[1:09:37] the evidence around them showed that
[1:09:39] they had a reason to
[1:09:41] fear yes we had the temple we can we can
[1:09:44] worship like we're supposed to but
[1:09:46] there's no
[1:09:48] safety we don't know what's coming next
[1:09:50] we don't know what's coming around the
[1:09:52] corner
[1:09:54] and we're still in the Old Testament
[1:09:56] time there is no Holy Spirit coming in
[1:09:58] there is no different things he like
[1:09:59] we're just doing our best with the blood
[1:10:01] of bulls and
[1:10:03] goats but everything I look around in
[1:10:05] the physical world there is no peace
[1:10:08] there is no safety there is no
[1:10:12] protection Nehemiah is the one that's
[1:10:14] coming in that he has the faith because
[1:10:16] he has the ear of the king he has the
[1:10:19] opportunity to speak out he has the
[1:10:21] opportunity to make a request and so we
[1:10:24] all know the story that Nehemiah is able
[1:10:27] to be excused he's able to be given uh
[1:10:30] if I remember correctly a 12year
[1:10:33] vacation to go off and do
[1:10:36] this and so we're going to jump in at
[1:10:40] Nehemiah chapter
[1:10:42] 2 and verse
[1:10:49] 9 then I came to the governors beyond
[1:10:51] the river and gave them the king's
[1:10:54] letters now the king had sent captains
[1:10:56] of the army and Horsemen with me when s
[1:11:00] s balot the horonite and tobah the
[1:11:02] servant the ammonite heard of it it
[1:11:05] grieved them exceedingly that there was
[1:11:07] come a man to seek the welfare of the
[1:11:09] children of Israel so I came to
[1:11:12] Jerusalem and was there three
[1:11:15] days and I arose in the night and I and
[1:11:18] some few men with me neither told I any
[1:11:21] man what my God had put in my heart to
[1:11:23] do at Jerusalem neither was there any be
[1:11:26] Beast with me save the Beast that I rode
[1:11:31] upon I went out by Night by the gates of
[1:11:34] the
[1:11:34] valley even before the dragon well and
[1:11:37] to the dung port and viewed the walls of
[1:11:39] Jerusalem which were broken down and the
[1:11:42] gates thereof were consumed with
[1:11:44] fire then I went on to the gates of the
[1:11:47] fountain and to the king's pool but
[1:11:49] there was no place for the Beast that
[1:11:51] was under me to pass then went I up in
[1:11:54] the Night by the Brook and viewed the
[1:11:55] wall and turned back and entered by the
[1:11:58] gate of the valley and so returned and
[1:12:01] the rulers knew not whether I went or
[1:12:03] what I did neither had I as yet told it
[1:12:06] to the Jews nor to the priests nor to
[1:12:08] the Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the
[1:12:10] rest that did the
[1:12:22] work
[1:12:24] brother brandom says in the sermon
[1:12:26] expectation he says now brother let's
[1:12:28] get Plum back off his ter territory
[1:12:30] let's come back to God come back to the
[1:12:32] altar rebuild the altar again that's
[1:12:35] been torn down build up your home take
[1:12:37] them cards off the table and all of them
[1:12:39] old love story magazines and open up the
[1:12:41] Bible and read the Bible and pray just
[1:12:44] don't get down and say bless my family
[1:12:46] and Mary and Joe and John and all of
[1:12:47] them get in the bed no sir stay there
[1:12:50] with God oh
[1:12:52] my
[1:12:54] and so Nehemiah came and at first he
[1:12:57] just looked everything
[1:12:59] over first he was just he didn't come in
[1:13:02] and just immediately go we're doing this
[1:13:04] he's like no I need to get
[1:13:06] a accurate
[1:13:08] report of what is actually needs to be
[1:13:12] done I need to look it over for myself I
[1:13:14] need to take the time to know for
[1:13:17] sure and not just coming yes I heard a
[1:13:19] report that all this is the state of it
[1:13:22] but I need to examine it for myself s
[1:13:23] see how bad is it really how good maybe
[1:13:27] some spots are I need to see where does
[1:13:31] the work actually need to be
[1:13:36] done as brother Wendell's been preaching
[1:13:39] on the Watchmen upon the
[1:13:43] wall and it said in Isaiah that we read
[1:13:46] at the beginning that I've set those
[1:13:48] Watchmen upon thy walls which shall
[1:13:50] never hold their peace day or night that
[1:13:53] they make mention of the Lord keep not
[1:13:54] silence and give him no rest till he
[1:13:56] established until he make Jerusalem a
[1:13:58] praise in the
[1:13:59] earth Nehemiah came in as the Watchman
[1:14:03] at this time he was the one that was
[1:14:04] looking for what needed to be done he
[1:14:06] was looking for
[1:14:08] what was the problems what were needed
[1:14:11] to be addressed what needed to be dealt
[1:14:14] with but the Watchman wasn't the one
[1:14:16] that was going to do every bit of the
[1:14:19] work just like today when we talk about
[1:14:22] the Watchman whether it's the the
[1:14:24] minister
[1:14:27] preaching whether
[1:14:29] it's a parent in the home the Watchman
[1:14:32] isn't one that does all the work now the
[1:14:35] Watchman can do
[1:14:37] some as parents we're in there working
[1:14:40] on our
[1:14:41] families but yet even in those
[1:14:44] situations we're trying to train our
[1:14:47] children to do certain things we're
[1:14:49] training them to be able to step up on
[1:14:51] their own they don't get to walk in on
[1:14:53] on our Salvation we're trying to show
[1:14:55] them the path we're trying to show them
[1:14:57] how to do it we're calling out the
[1:14:59] warning to them and the ministry the
[1:15:02] same way as the minister speaks to the
[1:15:04] congregation and cries out addresses the
[1:15:07] issues points out what needs to be done
[1:15:09] he's not the one coming in and going hey
[1:15:11] I'm going to completely handle the
[1:15:13] situation in your life for
[1:15:15] you but he is the one calling out hey
[1:15:17] here's a warning the enemy is coming in
[1:15:20] hey here's a warning this is the weak
[1:15:22] spot that needs to be built up hey
[1:15:24] here's the place the wall needs to be
[1:15:26] taken care
[1:15:28] of but yet it wasn't the watchman's job
[1:15:31] to be the one to actually build
[1:15:34] it the mman is the one that keeps
[1:15:36] calling out the Watchman is the one that
[1:15:37] keeps sounding the warning but then
[1:15:39] somebody else has to actually
[1:15:43] respond and Nehemiah came in
[1:15:47] and he has all of these men that are
[1:15:51] there some of them
[1:15:53] are the men that traveled in when Ezra
[1:15:56] came nine years
[1:15:59] before some of them are maybe ones that
[1:16:03] have either been born there in the 70
[1:16:06] years since the temple was rebuilt maybe
[1:16:09] they were children during that
[1:16:13] time you have this this group of people
[1:16:16] that are gathered
[1:16:18] around you know some of these like I
[1:16:20] said were born in this they've grown up
[1:16:22] with with crumbled walls around
[1:16:25] them they've never known anything
[1:16:27] different they've never they've never
[1:16:30] known Jerusalem as a Haven they've never
[1:16:33] known Jerusalem as the place of safety
[1:16:36] they've never known Jerusalem as the
[1:16:38] city of
[1:16:40] Peace they've only ever known it as the
[1:16:43] place of the temple surrounded by
[1:16:45] crumbling
[1:16:48] walls that's all they've ever known and
[1:16:51] Nehemiah comes in and he's spend several
[1:16:53] days the three days just checking out
[1:16:57] everything before he says a word to
[1:17:00] anyone he's looking at the
[1:17:03] walls and I wouldn't be at all surprised
[1:17:05] if he's also even assessing the people
[1:17:07] that are there a little
[1:17:09] bit he went out to look at the walls at
[1:17:11] night but during the day he's still
[1:17:14] around the
[1:17:15] people and he's walking and go okay are
[1:17:19] they hard workers are they
[1:17:23] people that still seem inspired to do
[1:17:25] things are they dragging through life
[1:17:28] because they're so down in the dumps
[1:17:29] nothing
[1:17:30] matters which one is it what kind of
[1:17:33] people are they what kind of leaders do
[1:17:35] they have around them what kind of all
[1:17:36] these different things he's assessing
[1:17:38] he's looking he's trying to get a gauge
[1:17:40] on what he's going to be dealing with
[1:17:43] and what he's going to be
[1:17:52] facing in Nehemiah chapter
[1:17:55] 3 and verse
[1:18:00] 28 from above the horse gate repaired
[1:18:03] the priests everyone over against his
[1:18:07] house after them repaired zadok the son
[1:18:11] of EMR over against his house after him
[1:18:13] repaired also shemiah the son of shakina
[1:18:16] The Keeper of the East
[1:18:19] Gate when Nehemiah finally called the
[1:18:21] men up to work
[1:18:23] when he gathered them when he was able
[1:18:25] to start giving out
[1:18:27] assignments he assigned the men to
[1:18:30] rebuild the wall that was near their
[1:18:35] house he didn't have them go all the way
[1:18:38] across the city to the other side he had
[1:18:42] them repair the wall that was directly
[1:18:44] in front of their
[1:18:45] house and so that every day when they
[1:18:48] would go out and
[1:18:49] work brother Robert every day you would
[1:18:52] go out to rebuild the wall you could see
[1:18:54] the safety of your family getting
[1:18:58] better because the protection was right
[1:19:00] there you didn't have to come back home
[1:19:03] and see oh the Wall's still crumbling
[1:19:04] right by my house because I've been
[1:19:06] working on the other side of the city no
[1:19:08] the wall in front of your
[1:19:10] family was being built back up by your
[1:19:13] own hands you knew what kind of quality
[1:19:17] work you were doing you knew if you were
[1:19:19] being lazy and not putting everything
[1:19:23] just the way that it should not not
[1:19:25] putting the bricks quite close enough
[1:19:28] not not mixing up all the uh the mud to
[1:19:31] put the together not mixing that
[1:19:32] correctly making it too crumbly or
[1:19:34] making it too wet you knew the kind of
[1:19:37] work you were doing and you knew it what
[1:19:40] was at
[1:19:42] stake because you weren't building it
[1:19:45] for the person across
[1:19:47] town you were building it for your
[1:19:50] family and you knew that your wife's
[1:19:53] life and your children's life was going
[1:19:56] to rest upon the quality of the work
[1:19:59] that you did on the wall right
[1:20:03] there Nehemiah came in as the Watchman
[1:20:06] calling out this needs done this needs
[1:20:08] done this needs done but then he re
[1:20:10] pointed out and he said brother Miguel
[1:20:14] you have to protect your own family so
[1:20:15] you build the wall right there that's
[1:20:18] your house that's your wife that's your
[1:20:21] children you build the wall
[1:20:24] and he assigned each man to be working
[1:20:27] over their
[1:20:34] family and I think
[1:20:37] that a lot of these
[1:20:39] men to me I would say that you probably
[1:20:43] had a few of these men that were like
[1:20:45] shamgar where they had hit the point
[1:20:47] where they were so fed
[1:20:50] up with that r risk that the enemy could
[1:20:53] come in and take their family at any
[1:20:56] time the enemy could come in and take
[1:20:59] their crops could take their supplies
[1:21:01] could take their family run off with
[1:21:04] their kids or steal their wife or do any
[1:21:06] of this they were so fed up of having
[1:21:08] that
[1:21:09] fear in the back of their
[1:21:11] mind that as soon as they had that
[1:21:17] chance they might not be able to grab
[1:21:20] the ox code like shamgar
[1:21:23] but I could grab my brick in my
[1:21:25] TR and I can start protecting my family
[1:21:28] right
[1:21:29] here I don't have the enemy to hit with
[1:21:31] an ox code but I can start to build the
[1:21:34] protection because now the moment has
[1:21:36] come the The Watchman has called out the
[1:21:38] Watchman has told me I now have the
[1:21:41] opportunity to build here this is where
[1:21:44] the weak place is this is where the work
[1:21:46] needs to be
[1:21:48] done and I the king has said that we can
[1:21:52] do this
[1:21:53] I'm not being stopped by the enemy
[1:21:54] anymore I now have the right to start to
[1:21:57] work on
[1:21:59] it when brother brandom talks about
[1:22:02] shamgar he says he looked out there and
[1:22:05] he he's seen that his his righteous
[1:22:07] indignation he he wasn't a warrior he
[1:22:09] didn't have time to go away to school
[1:22:11] and train to fight these Philistines he
[1:22:12] didn't know nothing about it in the
[1:22:14] first place so he just grabbed the first
[1:22:15] thing he could get a hold of it was an
[1:22:17] ox you know what an ox goe is it's a big
[1:22:19] stick with a piece of brass on it knock
[1:22:21] the stuff off and ply with it when it
[1:22:23] gets choked up or poke the cattle and
[1:22:24] make them go through the gate he jumped
[1:22:26] out there in the middle of the road
[1:22:28] under this knowing that he was a child
[1:22:29] of God he wasn't a warrior he wasn't a
[1:22:31] preacher he wasn't this or that or the
[1:22:33] other you say let the preacher do the
[1:22:35] preaching let him bring the Revival
[1:22:36] you've got to do it too start a prayer
[1:22:38] meeting in your house burn up them cards
[1:22:40] you're playing take that beer out of the
[1:22:41] box let's start a Revival right yes sir
[1:22:44] he grabbed that stick and jumped out
[1:22:45] there in the middle of the road the
[1:22:47] spirit of God come and he killed 600
[1:22:50] Philistines these men jumped out there
[1:22:52] and they grabbed their TRS they grabbed
[1:22:54] the bricks they grabbed the mortar
[1:22:56] everything that they had and they
[1:22:58] started
[1:22:59] building because this they could do they
[1:23:01] could now begin to provide the
[1:23:03] protection for their family The Watchmen
[1:23:06] had called out but now they were the
[1:23:07] ones doing the work and they were the
[1:23:10] ones that would be responsible for how
[1:23:13] good the work
[1:23:15] was now not all these men I'm sure were
[1:23:19] trained in how to build a wall
[1:23:23] like I said how many of them were
[1:23:26] shopkeepers how many of them were
[1:23:28] farmers how many of them were this or
[1:23:31] we're that I'm sure they weren't every
[1:23:34] single one a
[1:23:35] Mason now if we had the same thing
[1:23:38] happen in our church we know brother
[1:23:39] Mitch's wall is going be
[1:23:41] great he's going to build up the wall
[1:23:43] around his house and nobody's getting
[1:23:45] in the wall around my house we got
[1:23:48] questions
[1:23:49] about because I don't know anything
[1:23:51] about it
[1:23:53] which means I'm probably taking a lot of
[1:23:54] trips to brother Mitch's house to find
[1:23:56] out so how do I do this how do you mix
[1:23:58] that mortar again how do I get it all
[1:24:01] set up and squared off just right how do
[1:24:03] I get this just the way it should
[1:24:07] be at least if I care about my house and
[1:24:10] care about my family I'm going to go
[1:24:11] talk to the man that knows how to do
[1:24:14] it and I'm sure you had the same thing
[1:24:16] happening there were men there that had
[1:24:18] no
[1:24:19] clue but maybe their neighbor there did
[1:24:22] or maybe the neighbor two houses over or
[1:24:24] three houses over and they were going
[1:24:26] over there and going give me a lesson
[1:24:30] because I need to know how to protect my
[1:24:32] family I know you're working on the
[1:24:34] house around your house and I'm not
[1:24:37] trying to pull you away from it I just
[1:24:39] need to know
[1:24:40] how I just need you to show me how to
[1:24:44] build
[1:24:46] this it's the same thing when you
[1:24:48] have the
[1:24:51] younger families younger married men
[1:24:55] younger married women that will go talk
[1:24:57] to some of the older brothers and older
[1:24:59] sisters be like how did you get
[1:25:02] there how did you go through all this
[1:25:04] how did you deal with all these kinds of
[1:25:08] things it's the exact same process is
[1:25:11] going to ask so how do I mix my mortar
[1:25:12] right how do I set the bricks you're
[1:25:15] going to someone that's been there
[1:25:16] someone that's dealt with
[1:25:18] it I'm not asking you to come and build
[1:25:21] my family for me I'm just asking you to
[1:25:24] help me know how to do
[1:25:27] it I'm asking for that
[1:25:32] information so that I can then take care
[1:25:34] of my own family so that I can then take
[1:25:36] care of the issues that are going on in
[1:25:38] my
[1:25:40] life hey if I'm a young single man or a
[1:25:43] young single woman that's looking for a
[1:25:45] spouse let me go talk to them some of
[1:25:48] these that have had longer marriage go
[1:25:50] how did you know it was the right person
[1:25:53] how did you set yourself up to be ready
[1:25:55] how did you set yourself up to be
[1:25:57] prepared for
[1:25:59] that all these different things where
[1:26:01] they're able to go over and ask that
[1:26:04] neighbor two three doors six doors Seven
[1:26:07] Doors
[1:26:08] over how do
[1:26:10] I is this mortar look all right is it
[1:26:12] little do I need to add some more water
[1:26:14] does it need a little
[1:26:16] more concrete mix or whatever in it does
[1:26:20] it does it have everything in it that it
[1:26:21] needs
[1:26:24] so that way I know that my family is
[1:26:27] protected so that way I know that
[1:26:29] everything's going to be taken care of
[1:26:31] if the enemy comes
[1:26:35] in Nehemiah chapter
[1:26:38] 4 and verse
[1:26:48] 16 Nehemiah has been threatened the
[1:26:51] people of Israel have been threatened
[1:26:53] that they could be attacked at any time
[1:26:55] because the Wall's not done and the
[1:26:57] enemies around them are ticked off that
[1:26:59] they're even trying to build the
[1:27:03] wall and it came to pass from that time
[1:27:05] forth that the half of my servants
[1:27:07] wrought in the work and the other half
[1:27:09] of them held both the spears the Shields
[1:27:11] and the bows and the habon and the
[1:27:13] rulers were behind all the house of
[1:27:16] Judah they which build it on the wall
[1:27:18] and they that bear burdens with those
[1:27:20] that laid it everyone with one of his
[1:27:21] hands wrought in the work and with the
[1:27:23] other hand he held a weapon for the
[1:27:25] builders everyone had his swords girded
[1:27:28] by his side and so build it and he that
[1:27:29] sound of the trumpet was by
[1:27:35] me the Watchman sounds the warning The
[1:27:38] Watchman says hey this is coming hey the
[1:27:42] enemy is going to be mad that you're
[1:27:43] trying to get your family in
[1:27:45] order the enemy is going to be upset
[1:27:47] that you're trying to apply the token to
[1:27:48] the house the enemy is going to be upset
[1:27:51] that you're starting
[1:27:52] to try to fix things you're trying to
[1:27:55] mend up the broken
[1:27:58] places that doesn't mean you
[1:28:01] stop it means you just make sure that
[1:28:03] you've got your weapon right beside
[1:28:05] you the work keeps going but you make
[1:28:09] sure that you're still Carrying Your
[1:28:10] Weapon to fight if the enemy shows up
[1:28:13] but you don't stop building the wall you
[1:28:15] don't stop putting the protection in
[1:28:17] place the Watchman keeps calling out
[1:28:20] going hey now there's an active threat
[1:28:23] that would be a term that we would hear
[1:28:24] now is there's now an active threat in
[1:28:26] the
[1:28:27] area it's like before there was a
[1:28:30] passive threat we knew enemies are
[1:28:31] surrounding us we knew all this was
[1:28:32] going
[1:28:33] on you could say the kind of same kind
[1:28:36] of thing with what is happening in
[1:28:38] Israel right now it's like you had a
[1:28:39] passive threat for a
[1:28:41] while and then when missiles start
[1:28:44] launching it's now an active threat
[1:28:45] there's things actually
[1:28:47] happening or there's a high likelihood
[1:28:50] that things are about to happen so we
[1:28:51] had now have an active threat going on
[1:28:54] and so Nehemiah as the Watchman is
[1:28:56] sounding the warning there is an active
[1:29:00] threat but that doesn't mean we stop
[1:29:03] building and we just stand around the
[1:29:05] holes in the wall thinking we'll defend
[1:29:09] ourselves no you keep doing the work
[1:29:12] even when the enemy starts attacking you
[1:29:14] even when the enemy starts going against
[1:29:16] it the work keeps
[1:29:18] going you just prepare yourself a little
[1:29:20] more to where now you have the sword
[1:29:23] right with you now you have the spear or
[1:29:26] the habon or whichever weapon it is you
[1:29:28] have it right with you the entire time
[1:29:30] that you're still traving on the mortar
[1:29:33] the entire time that you're still laying
[1:29:34] the bricks you've got a sword sheath
[1:29:36] that's your side because I'm not leaving
[1:29:38] it at home anymore it's going with me
[1:29:40] every step of the
[1:29:43] way that's one of the things that
[1:29:44] happens when the Holy Spirit fills you
[1:29:47] is now suddenly you've got the sword
[1:29:48] with you it's no longer that
[1:29:52] the sword is being left at home we've
[1:29:54] moved into the place where now the sword
[1:29:56] is going with me I'm carrying my weapon
[1:29:59] with me at all times I have the word of
[1:30:01] God inside and I'm ready to fight if
[1:30:03] necessary but I'm also going to keep
[1:30:06] building I'm not stopping the watchman's
[1:30:09] still telling me about the weak places
[1:30:12] The Watchman is still saying hey this is
[1:30:14] in your life it doesn't need to be there
[1:30:17] anymore and you don't stand there and go
[1:30:19] yeah but I've got a sword I'm good
[1:30:22] it doesn't matter that there's a gap in
[1:30:24] the wall because I've got a
[1:30:25] sword it's not the way it
[1:30:28] works yes great you have a sword if the
[1:30:31] enemy attacks before you can get it
[1:30:33] rebuilt you have the sword to fight him
[1:30:35] off but you keep
[1:30:38] building because the goal is to have the
[1:30:40] wall up so that the enemy can't even get
[1:30:42] to you then the enemy can't even get in
[1:30:45] you don't I've got my sword but I'm on
[1:30:48] this side of the wall the enemy is on
[1:30:49] that
[1:30:50] side great
[1:30:52] I don't have to fight right at this
[1:30:54] moment because he can't get past the
[1:30:56] wall he can't get past the
[1:31:03] barrier in blind barus brother brandom
[1:31:06] says you'll have to fight every inch of
[1:31:07] it the devil will make you fight with
[1:31:09] the sword of God every inch you could
[1:31:12] but remember footsteps is possession
[1:31:14] wheresoever your foot Treads that I give
[1:31:17] unto you every step you can make you
[1:31:20] know that gets me feeling religious foot
[1:31:21] steps of possession all the land that
[1:31:23] your feet will tread upon in this
[1:31:25] promised land it's yours it's the same
[1:31:27] to every believer tonight anything that
[1:31:29] you can take any Divine promise of God
[1:31:31] and claim it and hold it it's
[1:31:40] yours in the greatest battle ever
[1:31:43] fought brother brandom says when the
[1:31:45] enemy attacks us then oh I tell you you
[1:31:48] ought to come join our what are you
[1:31:49] going to do back down compromise not a
[1:31:52] real Soldier won't no sir what do we do
[1:31:54] then the mind let the mind that was in
[1:31:57] Christ is that what the Bible said the
[1:31:59] mind that was in Christ be with you what
[1:32:01] kind of mind did he have stay with the
[1:32:03] word that's right stay with the word the
[1:32:05] father's word and defeated the enemy
[1:32:07] every time now when the enemy attacks
[1:32:10] and tries to say you got to do this and
[1:32:12] do that what you going to do stay with
[1:32:14] the word that's right what you want to
[1:32:17] do then take the word what is the word
[1:32:19] the Bible said here we just read it for
[1:32:21] the spirit and of God is the word look
[1:32:23] here and take the helmet of salvation
[1:32:25] and the sword the sword of the spirit
[1:32:28] the sword of the spirit the spirit that
[1:32:30] comes in through your mind enters into
[1:32:31] you and the sword of the spirit is the
[1:32:33] word of God what does the spirit fight
[1:32:35] with what does the Holy Spirit fight
[1:32:37] with Sensations feelings the word Glory
[1:32:41] what does it fight with the word let's
[1:32:43] say it the word the word of God is what
[1:32:47] the spirit fights with the spirit of God
[1:32:49] walks right up to the devil and says it
[1:32:51] is written amen it is written and the
[1:32:53] devil gives way what do we do take the
[1:32:56] sword which is the word of God pull it
[1:32:58] with what a hand of faith strong hand of
[1:33:01] Faith the two-edged sword the Bible said
[1:33:03] in Hebrews 4 it's a two-edged sword Cuts
[1:33:05] both coming and going brother what does
[1:33:08] he do take the word take the spirit let
[1:33:09] the Spirit come into your heart open
[1:33:11] your mind say Thy word is true Thy word
[1:33:16] is
[1:33:20] truth
[1:33:22] the men of Jerusalem began to see a
[1:33:24] transformation around
[1:33:26] them every day they would go out and
[1:33:29] work and they would go
[1:33:32] home encrusted in dust encrusted in mud
[1:33:36] encrusted in
[1:33:38] whatever get cleaned up go to bed get up
[1:33:41] the next morning but every morning when
[1:33:43] they stepped out they could see the
[1:33:45] progress that they had made the day
[1:33:46] before they could see the hole was a
[1:33:49] little bit smaller than it had been
[1:33:52] even if they had spent all day going
[1:33:55] over to brother Mitch's and getting
[1:33:57] lessons so all they had been able to lay
[1:33:58] was two
[1:33:59] bricks that was still two bricks more
[1:34:02] than what they had had the day
[1:34:04] before and then they went back and you
[1:34:06] know maybe got a follow-up lesson in a
[1:34:07] few days and that day they were able to
[1:34:10] lay four
[1:34:13] bricks you know other days they didn't
[1:34:15] they were like okay I'm good enough I
[1:34:17] can keep going for a while without any
[1:34:18] more lessons so today I'm laying
[1:34:22] 40 bricks 50 bricks 100 bricks whatever
[1:34:26] it might be but every day they could get
[1:34:29] up in the morning and they could see the
[1:34:31] progress that had been made they could
[1:34:32] see that the work was being
[1:34:35] done they could see the gates that were
[1:34:38] beginning to be rehung and were
[1:34:40] beginning to actually be able to close
[1:34:41] and fasten they could see the walls that
[1:34:44] were beginning to be rebuilt they could
[1:34:46] see the towers they were beginning to be
[1:34:47] refortified so that a Watchman could
[1:34:49] actually stand up on the tower and see
[1:34:51] off in the
[1:34:52] distance they could see every bit of
[1:34:55] this work that was taking
[1:34:58] place and can you just
[1:35:02] imagine the sense
[1:35:05] of accomplishment the sense of Pride the
[1:35:09] sense of satisfaction that these men
[1:35:11] would have every day when they got up to
[1:35:13] go my family is a little bit safer than
[1:35:15] they were
[1:35:17] yesterday and when I get done today
[1:35:19] they're going to be safer tomorrow than
[1:35:20] they are today all right and when I get
[1:35:22] done the next day they're going to be
[1:35:24] safer that day than they were the day
[1:35:26] before and they're going to be safer the
[1:35:27] day after than they were the day
[1:35:30] before because I'm going to keep working
[1:35:32] on it because the goal at the end is
[1:35:35] that the enemy can't get in the goal is
[1:35:38] at the end that there are no gaps there
[1:35:39] are no places where the enemy can get in
[1:35:43] to my
[1:35:46] family and I'm sure that there were some
[1:35:49] of the men that got scared when they
[1:35:50] heard an attack might
[1:35:52] come and when they got the new orders
[1:35:55] come out I want every man to be wearing
[1:35:56] his sword as he's
[1:35:59] building there may have been even a few
[1:36:01] men that stayed home because they
[1:36:04] couldn't bring themselves to do it
[1:36:05] because they were too
[1:36:07] scared there may have been some that
[1:36:09] wouldn't face the challenge they
[1:36:10] couldn't rise up to
[1:36:13] it but there were plenty of others
[1:36:16] they're willing to go
[1:36:18] okay if I have to lay two bricks because
[1:36:22] I'm fighting the enemy
[1:36:24] actively and all I can get is two more
[1:36:27] bricks my family is still safer at the
[1:36:29] end of the day than they were at the
[1:36:31] beginning because I've done two more
[1:36:34] we've gone another step further we've
[1:36:37] gotten a little bit closer to that wall
[1:36:40] being fully taken care
[1:36:42] of and I know the quality of the work
[1:36:44] I'm doing because this is for my
[1:36:47] family this is for my wife this is for
[1:36:50] my kids
[1:36:55] it's all too easy for us
[1:36:58] in nowadays where we get focused on our
[1:37:03] jobs we get focused on our careers we
[1:37:05] get focused on these are the things that
[1:37:07] I need to
[1:37:09] accomplish and we can start to forget
[1:37:12] about what we have to accomplish at
[1:37:15] home we can start to forget about making
[1:37:19] sure that the wall is built up at home
[1:37:22] that were protecting the family at
[1:37:24] home because you can't
[1:37:28] see physical transformation the same way
[1:37:31] that they could with that wall on the
[1:37:34] wall every single brick you could see as
[1:37:37] you put it
[1:37:40] down as husbands as parents
[1:37:45] as we work on it but you don't
[1:37:49] necessarily
[1:37:50] see things change from that work in that
[1:37:54] moment you can't see okay I've placed
[1:37:57] another
[1:37:58] brick okay I've placed another 10 bricks
[1:38:01] okay I've placed another however
[1:38:05] many at the end of the day you go okay I
[1:38:08] had a conversation with my
[1:38:10] son I don't know if he heard a word I
[1:38:16] said so did any bricks get
[1:38:20] laid
[1:38:22] did it actually
[1:38:24] happen or was this kind
[1:38:27] of was it a waste of
[1:38:30] time which one was it because I can't
[1:38:33] see it in the
[1:38:36] moment we can't see it in the moment
[1:38:41] and as men especially we like the
[1:38:44] satisfaction of seeing we've been able
[1:38:46] to accomplish something now it's one of
[1:38:48] the reasons that a so often we focus on
[1:38:50] our careers because we we know we're
[1:38:51] getting things done we know we're
[1:38:54] getting things accomplished we can see
[1:38:55] progress we can see things are
[1:38:58] happening when we're taking care of our
[1:39:01] kids or we're taking care of our spouse
[1:39:04] sometimes we don't feel like did was any
[1:39:06] progress
[1:39:07] made did did anything
[1:39:12] happen and I'm going to assume that
[1:39:15] sometimes the wise feel the same
[1:39:20] way you guys can discuss that amongst
[1:39:22] yourselves after service on whether
[1:39:23] that's right or not but I would assume
[1:39:26] that the wives do the same thing
[1:39:28] sometimes we're feeling
[1:39:30] hey I've done this for my husband and I
[1:39:32] have no idea if anything happened I have
[1:39:34] nothing I have no idea if there was any
[1:39:37] building that happened here I've done
[1:39:39] this with my children I don't know if
[1:39:42] there's I have corrected this
[1:39:45] child a hundred times on the exact same
[1:39:48] thing and they still leave their socks
[1:39:51] in the middle of the
[1:39:52] floor there are no bricks going down
[1:39:55] there is no progress being
[1:39:57] made nothing is
[1:40:03] happening we can't see the progress like
[1:40:06] they could as they were building that
[1:40:08] physical
[1:40:09] wall but yet the bricks are still going
[1:40:12] down the time that's being invested is
[1:40:14] still taking place the time that we
[1:40:16] spend with our family the time that we
[1:40:19] spend on that relationship the time that
[1:40:22] we spend on our own relationship with
[1:40:25] Christ how many times is it that you get
[1:40:29] down you do your devotions you read your
[1:40:31] scriptures and you get up and go I
[1:40:33] didn't get a thing out of it I just read
[1:40:35] through however many chapters How many
[1:40:37] verses and you walk away going none of
[1:40:40] it stuck I didn't get a bit of
[1:40:44] it I spent 30 minutes I spent an hour I
[1:40:47] spent
[1:40:49] whatever but then how many
[1:40:52] times as you're out doing something
[1:40:55] whether
[1:40:56] it's out on a job site whether
[1:40:59] it's at the job whether it's in a
[1:41:03] store something gets brought back to
[1:41:05] your
[1:41:07] remembrance a verse pops back up or a
[1:41:10] quote pops back
[1:41:13] in
[1:41:15] and maybe you not don't even remember
[1:41:18] exactly when you last read that you know
[1:41:20] don't remember the exact last time that
[1:41:22] you did read it now I know there are
[1:41:24] other times when we're reading the
[1:41:26] scripture or we're reading the quotes
[1:41:27] and there are things popping out all
[1:41:29] over to us it's almost like God's coming
[1:41:31] through with a highlighter and just
[1:41:33] making it pop for
[1:41:35] you but there other times you're going
[1:41:37] through it and you're doing the work and
[1:41:40] you're tring and you're putting down the
[1:41:43] bricks and it's not pretty work it's not
[1:41:46] fun
[1:41:47] work and you feel like
[1:41:52] did anything actually happen was there
[1:41:53] any progress did I actually get
[1:41:56] something
[1:42:02] done these
[1:42:06] men had seen this amazing change going
[1:42:09] on through their lives they had how so
[1:42:11] many of them had come in and they walked
[1:42:14] in to see the walls broken others had
[1:42:16] been born and raised there and they grew
[1:42:19] up only knowing broken Bren
[1:42:21] walls but now day after day they're
[1:42:25] seeing the walls be mended day after day
[1:42:28] they're seeing the progress
[1:42:31] made they're getting up in the
[1:42:35] morning they're strapping a sword to
[1:42:37] their side they're grabbing their tools
[1:42:39] and they're going out to where they
[1:42:41] worked
[1:42:42] yesterday to start building a little bit
[1:42:44] more to start putting a Little Bit
[1:42:47] Stronger protection there for for their
[1:42:53] family and at the end of
[1:42:57] it this
[1:42:59] wall that had been
[1:43:02] broken for 140
[1:43:06] years the temple was destroyed Jerusalem
[1:43:11] was torn up all these kind of things 70
[1:43:14] years they were gone they came back they
[1:43:15] rebuilt the
[1:43:17] temple they weren't allowed to rebuild
[1:43:19] the walls
[1:43:21] 61 years later Ezra comes back with some
[1:43:24] more men 9 years later Nehemiah shows
[1:43:28] up the walls have been broken for 140
[1:43:35] years and in 52
[1:43:40] days the walls and the gates are
[1:43:43] completely reared and
[1:43:48] restored and a big part of that was
[1:43:50] because because the men were focusing on
[1:43:53] the wall that affected their
[1:43:56] family they were focusing on what was
[1:43:58] going to take care of the ones they were
[1:44:00] entrusted to watch over the ones that
[1:44:03] they were entrusted to protect the ones
[1:44:05] that they were entrusted to be with the
[1:44:09] Watchman was there telling them where
[1:44:11] work needed to be done where are the
[1:44:12] weak places this is what needs done but
[1:44:15] the Watchman wasn't the one over there
[1:44:17] with the TR and the
[1:44:19] bricks he he wasn't the one there with
[1:44:21] the Mallet rehanging the doors he wasn't
[1:44:24] the one doing
[1:44:25] that that took each one of the men
[1:44:29] themselves to work on the
[1:44:32] wall by their
[1:44:39] house as we've been hearing these
[1:44:41] sermons about the Watchmen on the wall
[1:44:43] and the great responsibility do the
[1:44:45] Watchman have and I know that I've sat
[1:44:48] back there and it's made me think even
[1:44:50] more about what my call is and my
[1:44:53] responsibility towards it my
[1:44:56] responsibility not just as a minister
[1:44:58] but as a father and as a
[1:45:02] husband because it's the same thing
[1:45:04] where as a minister maybe I'm a Watchman
[1:45:07] in this environment but at home I'm a
[1:45:10] Watchman and have I been watching as
[1:45:12] good as I should at
[1:45:14] home have I been making sure that I
[1:45:17] haven't been letting things creep in
[1:45:18] through the cracks into the house
[1:45:20] shouldn't be there or creep into our
[1:45:22] lives that shouldn't be there have I
[1:45:23] been as diligent to make sure that those
[1:45:25] walls are
[1:45:28] repaired have I been as diligent to be
[1:45:30] calling it out of my wife or calling it
[1:45:33] out of my children that hey these are
[1:45:34] areas in your lives that need to be
[1:45:37] addressed hey these are areas as a
[1:45:40] family we need to work together to
[1:45:42] rebuild these are things that we need to
[1:45:48] do because it's not
[1:45:51] brother Wendell's
[1:45:52] job as he's up here ministering and
[1:45:55] being a Watchman it's not his job to
[1:45:57] grab the hammer and rebuild your life
[1:46:00] it's not his job to come in and rebuild
[1:46:02] the walls around your family or around
[1:46:05] your personal life or whatever it might
[1:46:08] be the Watchman is simply the one that
[1:46:11] calls out and gives the warning and
[1:46:14] points to what needs to be
[1:46:18] done but then each one of us
[1:46:21] us both as men and women are responsible
[1:46:24] for what we do with that
[1:46:27] warning the Watchman sounds the warning
[1:46:29] so the blood is now off their
[1:46:36] hands but now those of us that have
[1:46:38] heard the warning the blood's on our
[1:46:41] hands it's up to us on what we're
[1:46:43] actually going to do with
[1:46:45] it are we going to be inspired like
[1:46:48] these men were to where this is all
[1:46:51] about me protecting my family this is
[1:46:53] all about me protecting my wife
[1:46:56] protecting my children protecting my
[1:46:57] livelihood protecting whatever and I am
[1:47:00] going to rebuild to the best of my
[1:47:02] ability to make sure that they have the
[1:47:05] safety they
[1:47:07] need I am going to build and when
[1:47:09] threats come in when problems come in
[1:47:11] I'm not going to stop building I'm just
[1:47:13] going to gird on my sword and keep
[1:47:19] working
[1:47:21] are we able to step up into that or is
[1:47:24] it far too easy to fall
[1:47:27] into the lukewarm leesy in condition we
[1:47:30] go it's not that
[1:47:32] bad it's just a crack in the
[1:47:35] wall doesn't mean you know the Wall's
[1:47:37] Still
[1:47:39] Standing I don't know how easy it'll be
[1:47:42] to push over but I mean there's cracks
[1:47:44] but oh well it's okay there's a little
[1:47:47] hole it's not a problem it's not yet big
[1:47:50] enough enough for a guy to climb
[1:47:51] through not going to think about the
[1:47:53] fact they can shoot arrows through it
[1:47:54] but you know that a person can't climb
[1:47:57] through it so it's not bad yet it's not
[1:47:59] a bad
[1:48:05] situation it's too easy to fall into
[1:48:08] that type of mindset to go as we come to
[1:48:11] service Sunday after Sunday Wednesday
[1:48:13] after Wednesday and hear the Watchman
[1:48:16] calling out and you begin
[1:48:17] to deafen your ears a little bit go ah
[1:48:21] it's not that big a
[1:48:25] deal but yet the Watchman is calling us
[1:48:27] and trying to inspire us back to go this
[1:48:30] is about
[1:48:32] you this is about your
[1:48:39] family and this is the one
[1:48:43] where I can only go and go this is how I
[1:48:45] look at it as the man this is how I look
[1:48:48] at it as what my responsibility is
[1:48:51] what am I missing that needs to be fixed
[1:48:55] what are the things that I'm allowing
[1:48:59] that could affect my kids down the road
[1:49:01] because I didn't rebuild the
[1:49:04] wall because I didn't step in and clean
[1:49:07] things up because I didn't step in and
[1:49:09] was like oh it's a little hole it
[1:49:11] doesn't
[1:49:14] matter and then have a situation where
[1:49:16] down the road I'm going to have to
[1:49:18] answer for the fact that my kids
[1:49:19] continue to fight
[1:49:20] this because I didn't deal with it back
[1:49:23] then I wasn't willing to wear the sword
[1:49:26] and build the wall I was too distracted
[1:49:29] I was too focused by other things I was
[1:49:32] too
[1:49:38] busy the Watchman
[1:49:41] has such an important responsibility The
[1:49:44] Watchman has such an important
[1:49:48] role but the job doesn't stop at the
[1:49:52] Watchmen the job stops right where every
[1:49:55] single one of us is sitting or
[1:49:58] standing because it comes down to what
[1:50:00] we choose to do with it it comes down to
[1:50:03] whether we choose to accept the warning
[1:50:06] and we choose to do the
[1:50:08] work we choose to spend the time on our
[1:50:11] knees in prayer we choose to spend the
[1:50:13] time in the word we choose to spend the
[1:50:16] time going through our lives and getting
[1:50:18] rid of the trash
[1:50:20] we take the time to go through our homes
[1:50:23] we take the time to go through whatever
[1:50:25] it might be and we get rid of what
[1:50:27] shouldn't be
[1:50:29] there or we ignore the
[1:50:33] warning and wait to see what
[1:50:43] happens Nehemiah was
[1:50:45] inspired to go in but he
[1:50:48] wasn't the one called to build the wall
[1:50:53] himself he was called to come in and
[1:50:56] sound the warning he was called to come
[1:50:58] in and get the men
[1:51:04] working yes he was called to lead it he
[1:51:06] was called to be there and pointing out
[1:51:09] everything they needed done he was
[1:51:10] called to
[1:51:12] inspire but it was the men that were
[1:51:14] living there because Nehemiah he didn't
[1:51:17] come in with this large work group
[1:51:20] he didn't have a construction company
[1:51:22] that he brought with him to handle it
[1:51:25] all he showed up with a few men that he
[1:51:27] traveled
[1:51:28] with and then it was up to the people
[1:51:30] that were living
[1:51:31] there the ones
[1:51:34] that
[1:51:35] had for a lot of them lived their whole
[1:51:38] lives or most of their
[1:51:40] lives in the shadow of crumbling walls
[1:51:43] and burned
[1:51:45] Gates but they were the ones that had to
[1:51:48] do the work they were the ones that had
[1:51:50] had to get everything
[1:51:54] done the Watchman has the responsibility
[1:51:57] to call the
[1:51:59] warning but then the rest of us have to
[1:52:02] actually respond to the
[1:52:05] warning when brother Wendell or other
[1:52:08] ministers are up here passionately
[1:52:09] calling out and pointing
[1:52:11] out what's going on in each one of our
[1:52:16] Lives when a visiting Minister comes in
[1:52:18] and is preaching and and you
[1:52:21] know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he
[1:52:24] has no clue about anything in your life
[1:52:28] and yet every word he's saying is
[1:52:30] applying to what you're dealing
[1:52:33] with and then you want to step back and
[1:52:35] go ah it's a small hole it doesn't
[1:52:38] matter well if it didn't matter then
[1:52:40] why'd God have him say it right cuz you
[1:52:43] can't sit there and go well he knows my
[1:52:46] story I know we can do that when it's
[1:52:48] brother Wendell or or when it's me or
[1:52:51] when it's brother joshh or somebody
[1:52:52] that's in this home church we can go ah
[1:52:54] they know what's going on in my life
[1:52:56] that God didn't lead him to say that's
[1:52:57] just them want to pick on
[1:52:59] me but when you get these visiting
[1:53:01] ministers to come in and they will do
[1:53:03] the exact same thing and lay into
[1:53:08] it and you can't at that point how can
[1:53:11] you still say it's a small thing if God
[1:53:13] would inspire a man to preach
[1:53:17] it how can you say it's a small thing
[1:53:20] that doesn't
[1:53:24] matter and I am preaching it myself as
[1:53:26] much as any one of you because I have
[1:53:29] done it countless times over the
[1:53:32] years where they're preaching and
[1:53:34] they're hitting on what needs to be
[1:53:36] handled in my
[1:53:39] life and yet I get up and walk out the
[1:53:42] doors with no
[1:53:45] intention of doing
[1:53:47] anything with no not allowing any
[1:53:50] conviction to drive me not letting
[1:53:53] anything push me to what needs to be
[1:53:56] dealt with what needs to be
[1:54:01] addressed I was talking with brother
[1:54:03] Wendell Wednesday
[1:54:05] night after he had
[1:54:08] preached and we were talking a little
[1:54:10] bit about Israel
[1:54:13] and I was going you know for
[1:54:17] years as long as I have grown up in this
[1:54:20] message we have heard sermon after
[1:54:22] sermon after sermon saying the Rapture
[1:54:25] is almost here it's right around the
[1:54:26] corner it's right there
[1:54:28] it's and now I'm closing in on 40 so
[1:54:32] this has been being said for quite a
[1:54:35] while but yet brother brandom also told
[1:54:37] us that Israel is our time
[1:54:40] piece and so when you see these kind of
[1:54:43] things going
[1:54:44] on it should just make everything back
[1:54:47] aresh to us to go well wait
[1:54:50] I know we've been saying it for 40 years
[1:54:51] but how much closer are we now if this
[1:54:54] is what's happening there if this is
[1:54:56] what's going on if this is what we're
[1:54:58] seeing in the world these are the
[1:54:59] conditions that are happening how much
[1:55:01] closer are
[1:55:03] we how much closer are we to the enemy
[1:55:07] attack hey there's an active threat
[1:55:09] maybe it's time we G up our sword maybe
[1:55:11] it's time we get out there and build the
[1:55:13] wall and do what we're supposed to be
[1:55:18] doing
[1:55:20] maybe it's time for us to forget a
[1:55:23] little bit about do I have tons of
[1:55:27] savings in my bank account maybe it's
[1:55:30] time for us to stop worrying quite so
[1:55:32] much about have I built up my career the
[1:55:35] way that I should have I built this up
[1:55:37] have do I have everything ready so that
[1:55:39] way I'll be able to retire at this age
[1:55:41] and then I can enjoy all my years after
[1:55:45] that maybe it's time for us to get a
[1:55:47] little more focused on what what are we
[1:55:50] going to have on the other
[1:55:52] side am I going to be
[1:55:57] prepared when we're supposed to take
[1:55:59] that next
[1:56:01] step am I going to be where I'm supposed
[1:56:03] to be
[1:56:07] at we've heard the warning we've heard
[1:56:10] it over and over and
[1:56:13] over and
[1:56:17] over to where we
[1:56:20] start and we will get up here and we'll
[1:56:22] shout amen when the minister is saying
[1:56:25] the Rapture could happen at any time
[1:56:26] amen that's right it's
[1:56:29] true and then as soon as we step out the
[1:56:31] do is like all right so these are the
[1:56:33] jobs I have lined up for this week this
[1:56:34] is what I'm going to be doing and man if
[1:56:35] I can get this bid then I'll have this
[1:56:37] job for the next couple months and you
[1:56:39] know I've got to make sure that I hire
[1:56:41] enough employees at Chick-fil-A so that
[1:56:42] we're ready for this busy time and this
[1:56:44] that or the
[1:56:48] other
[1:56:50] and yet 10 minutes ago we were amening
[1:56:53] yes it could be any
[1:56:59] time and that's not to say there's
[1:57:01] anything wrong with business
[1:57:07] planning but do we really have to
[1:57:09] business plan as soon as we step past
[1:57:11] those
[1:57:17] doors or are we supposed to be taking at
[1:57:20] least a little bit of
[1:57:22] time to really be thinking considering
[1:57:25] about you know the Rapture could
[1:57:27] be in the morning it could be any
[1:57:32] moment and yes God wants us
[1:57:36] to plan as though we were going to be
[1:57:39] here a thousand years plan as though
[1:57:42] you're going to be
[1:57:43] here don't sell all your possessions go
[1:57:46] up on the mountain and wait for the
[1:57:48] rapture
[1:57:51] that's not the
[1:57:54] calling but maybe it's time for us to
[1:57:56] get a little more serious about those
[1:57:58] walls we're supposed to be building get
[1:58:00] a little more serious about having the
[1:58:01] sword strapped on so that we keep the
[1:58:04] enemy
[1:58:08] out you know I've admitted to people
[1:58:11] before
[1:58:14] when when we find out that that my wife
[1:58:17] was pregnant with silus
[1:58:21] I got stressed because immediately I'm
[1:58:24] going how in the world can I afford this
[1:58:26] it's like we've been good with three
[1:58:27] kids three kids have been great we've
[1:58:30] been doing this for years now we've got
[1:58:31] the budget figured out we've got things
[1:58:33] going what are we going to do with the
[1:58:35] fourth where is it going to fit in the
[1:58:38] house how are we going to pay for it how
[1:58:41] are we going to
[1:58:44] provide and then God decided to do it to
[1:58:47] me again
[1:58:51] when I started to settle with okay we've
[1:58:52] got a fourth we're
[1:58:56] good then God says hey here's one
[1:59:00] more I was never one of those
[1:59:03] parents that was thinking oh I'm GNA
[1:59:05] have one of these big homeschool
[1:59:08] families I came from a family of
[1:59:11] two my wife came from a family of
[1:59:14] two I thought at three I was great I
[1:59:18] went above and Beyond with
[1:59:21] three I was not trying to catch brother
[1:59:24] Michael this was not in the goal
[1:59:28] okay but then God said okay here let's
[1:59:31] give you a fifth and I got to go through
[1:59:33] the whole processing and going Lord how
[1:59:36] are we going to pay for
[1:59:37] this Lord where is this going to fit in
[1:59:39] the house where's silus going to go
[1:59:41] where's the baby going to go where's any
[1:59:43] of this how is this going to
[1:59:46] work how is my job going to provide for
[1:59:49] this
[1:59:50] this we're going to have two in diapers
[1:59:53] at once where's this coming from brother
[1:59:56] Michael knows all about that but how one
[2:00:00] with diapers is expensive enough make it
[2:00:07] two and I had to go through for a little
[2:00:10] while I'll admit I had a short time
[2:00:12] where I was then looking at my finances
[2:00:15] way too hard and thinking of what a
[2:00:17] failure I am because I don't have
[2:00:20] Savings in the bank because we don't
[2:00:22] have our own house we're still renting
[2:00:24] we don't have this we don't have that I
[2:00:26] still work at a fast food
[2:00:29] restaurant I am not in the world's terms
[2:00:32] at all
[2:00:34] successful I don't have rental
[2:00:36] properties out there bringing in income
[2:00:38] I don't have any of this kind of stuff
[2:00:39] whatever I don't have a tons of toys we
[2:00:42] don't have multiple vehicles in our
[2:00:43] family go down the checklist and
[2:00:46] according to the world I am not worth
[2:00:48] much
[2:00:52] and so you go through this when you have
[2:00:54] this kind of reminder thrown at you and
[2:00:57] you look at the finances and then you go
[2:00:59] look at like what any of the even
[2:01:02] so-called Christian Financial guys would
[2:01:04] tell you where you should be at and you
[2:01:06] sit there going wow I haven't done a
[2:01:09] single thing right in my whole
[2:01:11] life I'm in an awful place we're all
[2:01:15] going to be living under a bridge before
[2:01:16] I'm done if I keep going down this path
[2:01:25] and it's so easy to get dragged into
[2:01:27] this
[2:01:32] mindset but yet at the same
[2:01:36] time
[2:01:38] when we turn around and go okay let's
[2:01:41] look at this from God's
[2:01:44] Viewpoint children are a blessing from
[2:01:46] the
[2:01:47] Lord blessing is the man whose quiver is
[2:01:50] full of
[2:01:54] them God didn't say that I had to have
[2:01:58] thousands or millions in the
[2:02:01] bank he said that I was supposed to work
[2:02:04] and do my best to provide for my
[2:02:07] family and not be stupid and run up a
[2:02:10] bunch of debt I'm still working on that
[2:02:17] part but yet he throws as you and goes
[2:02:19] from the world standpoint They're Going
[2:02:21] H the exact questions that I had to ask
[2:02:23] was start to ask myself how are we going
[2:02:25] to afford this how am I going to pay for
[2:02:27] another child what's going to
[2:02:29] happen and God's sitting over here going
[2:02:32] it's a blessing this is a good
[2:02:36] thing and So eventually you hit the
[2:02:38] point and I have no idea how long any of
[2:02:40] this process took because I wasn't
[2:02:42] keeping track but eventually you hit the
[2:02:44] point where we go all right Lord if
[2:02:45] you're giving us another one you're
[2:02:47] providing I'm going to keep doing what
[2:02:49] I'm supposed to do I'm going to go to
[2:02:51] work I'm going to do my best to provide
[2:02:54] and I'm going to trust you to get the
[2:02:57] income
[2:03:00] somehow whether
[2:03:02] that's raises whether that's bonuses
[2:03:05] whether that's something completely that
[2:03:07] I have never thought of you figure it
[2:03:11] out as long as I'm still doing my
[2:03:14] part my responsibility is more about am
[2:03:18] I building the wall around my family to
[2:03:21] take care of them
[2:03:23] spiritually at the end of it whether I
[2:03:26] have the millions in the bank doesn't
[2:03:29] matter whether I have the most
[2:03:31] successful whether I rent for the rest
[2:03:33] of my life and never buy a house really
[2:03:36] doesn't
[2:03:38] matter as much as a huge part of me in
[2:03:41] my heart quivers at the idea as much as
[2:03:44] my mind goes but that would be horrible
[2:03:47] you're throwing away money on rent every
[2:03:48] single
[2:03:52] month but yet God's
[2:03:54] call is to take care of my family and to
[2:03:58] raise them in the admonition of the
[2:04:01] Lord and if I'm making sure that I'm
[2:04:04] building the wall if I'm making sure to
[2:04:06] get rid of the junk that shouldn't be
[2:04:10] there if I'm making sure to teach my
[2:04:13] children the way that I should if I'm
[2:04:14] taking care to encourage and strengthen
[2:04:17] my wife the way that I should if doing
[2:04:19] those parts because the goal is keep the
[2:04:22] enemy out of my
[2:04:24] family that's my
[2:04:27] calling and that's the calling of each
[2:04:29] one of the men that's
[2:04:32] here and each one of the sisters that's
[2:04:35] here it's your calling to keep the enemy
[2:04:37] away from your children and to keep the
[2:04:40] enemy away from your
[2:04:42] husband and to keep the enemy away from
[2:04:44] your own
[2:04:47] life God calls us to build the
[2:04:53] walls to fill in the gaps to build the
[2:04:56] holes to repair the
[2:05:00] gates because Jerusalem is supposed to
[2:05:04] be the place of Peace it's supposed to
[2:05:06] be the place where you can feel that
[2:05:10] peace even in the midst of the
[2:05:13] storm even when surrounded by the enemy
[2:05:16] you can feel the peace and protection
[2:05:18] ction because you know the wall is
[2:05:22] standing God has armed us God has
[2:05:25] equipped us we have the sword to fight
[2:05:28] but as long as we're within those
[2:05:30] walls we actually don't have to fight
[2:05:34] it's only when we venture out if we're
[2:05:37] within the walls if the protection is
[2:05:40] there it's like the song that brother
[2:05:43] Mike sings you can't cross the bloodline
[2:05:46] as long as I'm staying behind that
[2:05:47] bloodline as long as as I'm making sure
[2:05:49] that token is
[2:05:51] there you can't get to me you can't get
[2:05:55] to my family you may be beating against
[2:05:59] the wall it may be sounding awful there
[2:06:01] may be all kinds of bad reports coming
[2:06:03] around but you can't actually get to us
[2:06:07] because we're behind the
[2:06:13] wall but if we haven't rebuilt the wall
[2:06:16] if we haven't applied the token
[2:06:19] then the enemy has free reign to come
[2:06:21] and
[2:06:22] go it's like those that lived in
[2:06:25] Jerusalem during that time for years the
[2:06:28] enemy could arrive at
[2:06:30] will for 140 years they could come
[2:06:35] in with basically nothing to stop
[2:06:38] them if they chose
[2:06:42] to for 70 years after the temple was
[2:06:46] rebuilt and now there's more of an
[2:06:48] attraction to come in and raid and take
[2:06:51] what's there the enemy could come in if
[2:06:54] they
[2:06:57] wanted but then God raised up
[2:07:02] Watchmen he sent an
[2:07:05] Ezra to work on getting the temple more
[2:07:08] in order where it was supposed to be he
[2:07:10] sent a Nehemiah to work on getting
[2:07:13] everything rebuilt at the walls and then
[2:07:16] yes also to deal with the temple even
[2:07:18] more
[2:07:20] he sent the Watchman in to point out
[2:07:24] what needed to be
[2:07:26] done and then he put it on each
[2:07:31] man and I would be willing to bet some
[2:07:34] of the wives got out there with their
[2:07:36] husbands and were building the
[2:07:38] wall I wouldn't be surprised at all if
[2:07:40] there were some of them out there
[2:07:41] putting some bricks down or spreading
[2:07:43] some mortar with their husbands to get
[2:07:46] this wall
[2:07:47] built
[2:07:49] but they were willing to go out there
[2:07:51] and do the
[2:07:53] work and they were able to rebuild this
[2:07:56] in basically record time because they
[2:07:58] were focusing on the wall that had the
[2:08:00] most effect to what was important to
[2:08:03] them to their family to their
[2:08:08] belongings how much can each one of us
[2:08:11] as we look at the walls that are
[2:08:13] supposed to be in our lives the token
[2:08:15] that's supposed to be
[2:08:17] applied
[2:08:19] and is the seal fully
[2:08:21] there or is there trash that we need to
[2:08:23] deal with are there some gaps that we
[2:08:25] need to build back up are there some
[2:08:27] places that we need to
[2:08:31] address don't get scared just because
[2:08:33] the enemy is saying they're going to
[2:08:35] attack just because you're hearing the
[2:08:37] reports going back and
[2:08:39] forth that just means it's time to
[2:08:41] buckle on the sword while you're
[2:08:43] building that just means it's time to
[2:08:45] carry your weapon with you at all times
[2:08:47] as you're building build it
[2:08:49] up but we're called to build the
[2:08:53] wall the Watchman tells us what needs
[2:08:56] done the Watchman points out the weak
[2:09:00] areas but then we're the ones on the
[2:09:02] ground that have to do the
[2:09:04] work we're the ones that are on the
[2:09:07] ground that need to be doing the praying
[2:09:10] that need to be doing the reading that
[2:09:11] need to be doing the
[2:09:13] cleaning as brother brandom said
[2:09:16] throwing out the cards or burning the
[2:09:18] cards are throwing out these different
[2:09:21] things we're the ones that are supposed
[2:09:23] to be doing
[2:09:25] that not the
[2:09:28] Watchmen let's have the musicians come
[2:09:31] back
[2:09:36] up brother brandom said in the sermon
[2:09:38] the
[2:09:39] token he said then when we pray we must
[2:09:43] have the token to present with our
[2:09:45] prayers as I said and now believe for
[2:09:47] ourselves and apply the token to the
[2:09:49] whole family like in Egypt Jericho or
[2:09:53] either in Acts 16:31 we find out that
[2:09:56] Paul told the Roman Centurion say
[2:09:58] believe thou and all thy house shall be
[2:10:01] saved apply it to your family if you've
[2:10:03] got an unsaved child lay the token right
[2:10:05] on top of him say Lord God I claim him
[2:10:08] stay right there if you got a mother or
[2:10:10] a loved one that's lost lay that token
[2:10:12] on them say Lord God I claim it move out
[2:10:16] all the worldly trash out of your house
[2:10:18] get ready for it burn up your shorts
[2:10:20] throw your card tables away get rid of
[2:10:22] your cigarettes dump your unbelief and
[2:10:25] your church papers in the trash can
[2:10:27] where they belong amen then you're
[2:10:29] getting ready then what do you do then
[2:10:33] apply the token in prayer with real
[2:10:34] evidence real Faith apply it apply it
[2:10:37] with confidence when you apply the token
[2:10:40] know that you are cleaned
[2:10:41] up if our hearts condemn us not then we
[2:10:45] have our request
[2:10:59] The Watchman calls out the warning the
[2:11:01] Watchman calls out a different warning
[2:11:03] to each one of us the way the wall is
[2:11:06] crumbling around my house maybe by
[2:11:10] Brother Joe's how it's a it's a gate
[2:11:13] that's hanging off the hinges
[2:11:15] slightly well I need mortar and Bricks
[2:11:18] he needs wood and hinges and mallets and
[2:11:21] we need different types of equipment we
[2:11:23] need different types of materials to
[2:11:25] repair because we have different
[2:11:31] issues when the Watchman calls out he's
[2:11:34] calling out the warning to each one of
[2:11:36] us and each one of us is applying it to
[2:11:37] our lives a little bit differently
[2:11:39] because the areas the gaps are a little
[2:11:42] different in each one of our
[2:11:46] Lives maybe you've just got a couple
[2:11:48] missing bricks that's a hole and you
[2:11:50] just got to fit those in other people
[2:11:52] maybe there's a huge massive chunk torn
[2:11:54] out of the wall other people maybe it's
[2:11:57] the gates are still hanging they just
[2:11:59] kind of need reattached and stuff other
[2:12:01] people maybe the gates are completely
[2:12:03] burned and gone and they need completely
[2:12:07] remade each one of us is different each
[2:12:11] one of us is dealing with our own
[2:12:15] things but the Watchman Faithfully get
[2:12:18] gets
[2:12:20] up and calls
[2:12:23] out the Watchman Faithfully gets
[2:12:27] up and not just from the
[2:12:30] pulpit every time you press press play
[2:12:33] you're hearing that Watchman calling
[2:12:36] out pointing out what needs done each
[2:12:38] time that you go back to the scriptures
[2:12:40] and begin to read The Watchman speaking
[2:12:43] out to
[2:12:46] you the Watchman is crying pointing out
[2:12:50] what needs
[2:12:54] done and it's up to each one of us on
[2:12:57] whether we're going to
[2:13:01] respond Lord Jesus
[2:13:07] we lord this seems like it's been a
[2:13:11] little bit all over the place Lord
[2:13:13] but Lord it was what you started to lay
[2:13:16] on my heart from Wednesday night from
[2:13:18] the sermon Lord
[2:13:23] and Lord I pray that you would help me
[2:13:25] to
[2:13:27] be a better Watchman
[2:13:33] Lord a better worker in my own life a
[2:13:37] better worker in my
[2:13:41] family Lord help me to respond to the
[2:13:44] the call of the The Watchmen around me
[2:13:46] Lord to
[2:13:48] to gird on the sword Lord
[2:13:51] to to grab the bricks and mortar and do
[2:13:53] the work that needs
[2:14:00] done Lord there's not
[2:14:03] a there's not a parent in
[2:14:08] here that would be willing to have one
[2:14:10] of their children lost
[2:14:14] Lord there's not a an individual in here
[2:14:17] that would be will to
[2:14:19] have one of their parents or siblings
[2:14:23] or family members
[2:14:26] that that didn't make
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:35] it Lord forgive us for when we
[2:14:38] get so busy with life when we get so
[2:14:42] busy with everything that's going on
[2:14:44] around us Lord
[2:14:46] when Lord when I get so busy just trying
[2:14:50] to make ends meet or trying to make sure
[2:14:54] things are provided
[2:14:57] for that I let the walls crumble around
[2:15:03] us Lord forgive us where we failed you
[2:15:09] Lord Lord give us the the spirit of
[2:15:12] shamgar Lord to to rise back up to fight
[2:15:15] off the
[2:15:16] enemy
[2:15:19] to rebuild those crumbling walls Lord to
[2:15:21] rehang the gates Lord
[2:15:24] Jesus Lord to be able to
[2:15:27] just enjoy the the peace that you bring
[2:15:31] us
[2:15:38] Lord I pray that you would be with each
[2:15:40] one of my brothers and sisters here Lord
[2:15:44] that Lord you would help them to to
[2:15:48] rebuild and
