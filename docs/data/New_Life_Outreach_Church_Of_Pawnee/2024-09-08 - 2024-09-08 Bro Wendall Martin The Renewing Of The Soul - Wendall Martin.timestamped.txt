[36:34] I have seen in thy Sanctuary because thy
[36:36] loving kindness is better than life my
[36:39] lips shall praise thee thus will I bless
[36:42] thee while I live and I will lift up
[36:45] mine hands in thy name thy Soul shall be
[36:48] my soul shall be satisfied as with moral
[36:50] and fatness and my mouth shall sing
[36:54] praise uh shall praise thee with joyful
[36:56] lips when I remember thee upon my bed
[36:59] and meditate on thee in the night

[37:04] therefore in the shadow of thy Wings
[37:07] will I Rejoice my soul followeth hard
[37:11] after thee thy right hand upholdeth
[37:16] me but those that seek my soul to
[37:19] destroy it shall be into the Lord parts
[37:22] of the earth they shall fall By The
[37:23] Sword and they uh they shall be a
[37:27] portion
[37:28] for
[37:29] foxes Let's uh go to the Lord in prayer
[37:32] here today Lord Jesus we thank you for
[37:36] all that you
[37:38] are and Lord as
[37:41] as our desire is for your word to have
[37:47] its uh proper effect Upon Our
[37:50] Lives Lord we know that it it requires
[37:53] your
[37:54] presence and we're asking Lord that your
[37:57] presence would would just be so sweet
[38:00] Among Us Lord as we feel you here
[38:02] tonight and that you would cause that
[38:06] that word uh to be
[38:09] germinated by your Holy Spirit Lord that
[38:13] you would bring Victory and healing and
[38:16] encouragement and most importantly draw
[38:19] us closer to you we thank you Lord for
[38:22] the wonderful testimony of an Hani today
[38:25] Lord as she has been believing for you
[38:28] and and for you to come Lord and ignite
[38:31] that faith and bring about the reality
[38:34] of what she's Lord been waiting for
[38:38] father we thank you for that now Lord
[38:40] we're asking that you would do the same
[38:43] for so many others Lord that you would
[38:45] lift us up into your presence tonight
[38:48] and we'll give you glory and honor in
[38:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[38:54] the church say
[38:55] amen and amen God bless bless you you
[38:57] may be seated here this evening amen I I
[39:01] want to minister this evening on the
[39:04] renewing of the
[39:06] soul and um amen as we have just read
[39:12] this this Psalm amen I uh he says my
[39:18] soul followeth hard after thee and thy
[39:22] right hand upholdeth
[39:24] me and when you find
[39:28] rest for your souls amen that's there's
[39:32] something about that amen there's
[39:34] there's no more struggle because your
[39:36] soul has found its anchor in the Lord
[39:40] Jesus Christ amen the soul is is when
[39:45] that soul is positioned in the word amen
[39:48] it is the same as as the as Israel being
[39:52] positioned in that promised land and and
[39:55] so we're we're thankful uh uh for that
[39:58] here tonight that the word that God has
[40:01] given us in this day amen the
[40:03] restoration of the word that the soul
[40:06] has found its anchor we have been placed
[40:09] we're no longer torn from Pillar To Post
[40:12] we're we're no longer uh struggling to
[40:16] identify with who we are we are the sons
[40:20] and daughters of God and there's
[40:22] something about when that Soul Finds Its
[40:24] rest in in in Christ the struggle is
[40:27] gone amen the struggle is over it's uh
[40:31] amen it's not laboring anymore it is it
[40:35] is found its rest and therefore the word
[40:39] has its perfect work in you you're no
[40:41] longer working it but the word is being
[40:44] worked through the life of God in that
[40:48] Soul now I I want before we get into the
[40:52] renewing of the soul I want us to to to
[40:55] to just briefly look at that
[40:57] because the in there is a a difference
[40:59] in the intellectual faith and the Soul
[41:02] Faith the intellectual Faith amen it can
[41:06] intellectually um adapt to the structure
[41:10] of of its environment amen whether it it
[41:13] be Judaism or whether it be um you know
[41:17] um Hamad uh uh whatever that amen that
[41:21] other religion is that you know where
[41:24] you where they they they have um the
[41:27] their prophet and and you you've got
[41:30] you've got the different religions and
[41:31] then you've got within the in the
[41:33] Christian realm you've got the all these
[41:35] denominations that you that that you
[41:38] would uh uh follow after and and you
[41:41] adapt to certain uh mindsets you adapt
[41:45] to certain structures and so amen but
[41:49] this is not what the what the Lord had
[41:52] in mind God does not want you int
[41:55] intellectually adapting to to the dress
[41:58] code and the or the tithes and the
[42:00] offerings or church attendance or uh
[42:03] your devotions you see this can all be
[42:05] done in the psyche it can all be it it's
[42:08] all right here in the mind amen but it
[42:11] it it's just a mental format and and and
[42:15] sooner or later it's going to start
[42:17] questioning and it'll question this and
[42:19] that and amen and and and so it is all
[42:23] done without relationship
[42:28] so you can do all of this and not have
[42:31] relationship because relationship can
[42:34] only come through the soul amen that is
[42:37] what is created in the image of God and
[42:40] so so the soul is all about relationship
[42:44] it's not about laws it's not about
[42:47] structure it's about
[42:50] relationship amen this is where God
[42:52] comes and fellowships with his sons and
[42:56] daughters this th this soul is where the
[42:59] Cravings come for fellowshipping God
[43:02] because once you ever come in fellowship
[43:05] with God and you've come into the
[43:06] realities of the promises of God Amen
[43:09] that's all you want that's all you long
[43:12] for is the presence of the Lord now
[43:16] brother brother bradam would say Amen uh
[43:19] and he would tell us why why people so
[43:21] tossed about and he would he would he
[43:24] would give the you know saying I I
[43:26] wonder what is lack in in people amen uh
[43:29] and then and then he would say it's very
[43:31] simple they've never gone all the way
[43:35] they never went all the way into that
[43:38] most holy place and he and he deals with
[43:41] the outer courts and then the the the
[43:43] holy place and then the most holy place
[43:46] and he and he talks about how amen
[43:48] intellectually they can accept Christ
[43:51] but but you've got to go into that inner
[43:54] Court into that most holy place there is
[43:58] where God comes down and supernaturally
[44:01] visits with his believer that's where
[44:04] God comes down in communes and
[44:06] fellowships the great Pillar of Fire
[44:09] coming down and there's where things
[44:11] really happen Amen in the first two
[44:14] courts it's human ability amen it's
[44:17] humans giving sacrifice and it's humans
[44:19] taking care of the altar then you go in
[44:21] and it's a human putting oil in the
[44:24] lamps and a human keeping the the amen
[44:27] the the fire lit but when you get into
[44:30] the inner Court when you get into the
[44:32] most holy place it's you setting their
[44:35] resting and it's God coming down and
[44:39] making you to live it's God coming in
[44:42] and amen and and and and and and giving
[44:44] life to the shoe bread and giving life
[44:47] to the to to Aaron's Rod it's it is is
[44:50] nothing you have no part in that at all
[44:54] it's all God Amen and so that's that is
[44:58] where the soul is amen you've got the
[45:00] body you've got the spirit which is the
[45:02] mind and then you've got the soul and
[45:04] the soul is where you and God Fellowship
[45:10] now now brother bradam would say he says
[45:12] you find them people who who seem to be
[45:14] very religious seem to have uh such a
[45:16] deep desire daily they search and hunt
[45:18] and seek for God never come to any kind
[45:21] of a settlement of any kind to where
[45:23] they could ever be settled and anchored
[45:25] in Christ this I have learn to be an
[45:27] experience that this is people of
[45:29] intellectuals and speaking this there's
[45:31] two different types of Christianity it
[45:33] seems strange but I but I will not say
[45:37] two types I I will say two uh different
[45:40] phases would be a better word to use not
[45:43] types but phases the Christianity but
[45:45] two phases of it amen one of them is
[45:48] intellectual a mental conception of what
[45:50] God has said in his word and of Jesus
[45:51] Christ by the way of knowledge and the
[45:53] other is an experimental experience that
[45:56] God has given the man in his heart and
[45:59] and the one is intellectually hungry he
[46:01] is feasting on God but his Feast doesn't
[46:03] hold out the other one seems to have
[46:06] Victory all the time there's nothing
[46:08] bothers them they're just as solid and
[46:11] anchored as they can be there's no
[46:12] trials no storms bothers them at all
[46:15] they but but they seem to have something
[46:17] about them that people uh uh who are
[46:19] Christians and trying to live for God
[46:21] admire that type of a Christian I've
[46:24] often wondered Lord what is it these
[46:26] people have that others crave so much
[46:28] yet seem to fail to get it he goes on
[46:31] and says and finding it so simple in the
[46:32] word of God we Tred to explain it and in
[46:36] order now to do this after seeing the
[46:38] intellectual part of the Mind the soul
[46:40] which is in the
[46:41] heart the mind and the Soul which is in
[46:43] the heart amen you truly have two
[46:46] different mental faculties you have one
[46:48] of them in your head by your brain and
[46:51] the others operated in your heart which
[46:53] is called your soul your spirit and your
[46:55] soul now they're very much in
[46:57] disagreement many times when the head
[47:00] seems to say something the soul wonders
[47:02] at it as if it's not right and when it
[47:05] comes into the soul the head seems to
[47:07] step back and there's been things that's
[47:09] happened to you that you knew was going
[47:12] to be yet you could not explain why
[47:15] there's no reason you couldn't explain
[47:17] it out but you just accepted it and it
[47:21] just happened that way and that's
[47:23] something that happens way down in here
[47:26] can you say amen so the soul is is right
[47:30] at home in the presence of God Amen now
[47:34] your mind is not always comfortable with
[47:35] the presence of God but your soul is
[47:38] right at home amen your mind you're you
[47:41] you you can you can be in a good church
[47:43] service and enjoying it and then your
[47:45] mind is saying it's getting late amen we
[47:47] need to go uh I I need to go to work in
[47:49] the morning oh the kids have got to get
[47:51] to bed and and amen but but if you would
[47:54] let your soul continue your soul is
[47:58] enjoying the presence of God Amen so the
[48:02] mind is in direct conflict it's Amen it
[48:05] doesn't that the spirit of the Lord will
[48:06] move upon you to Amen to to uh you know
[48:10] just come on you to give a $100 to a
[48:12] brother in the church and your mind is
[48:14] saying you do that you're walking to
[48:16] work all week amen and and and then
[48:19] there's a struggle that goes on in
[48:21] between God can deal with you in your
[48:25] soul but your mind does not always agree
[48:29] with that can you say amen amen so so
[48:33] when we look at this Amen brother
[48:35] brother bradam would say trying to do
[48:37] something these these classes they try
[48:39] to say themselves each one Amen in that
[48:42] intellectual class they go to church
[48:43] every Sunday that's very good I want to
[48:45] be religious that's very good they they
[48:47] still under under the law but by when by
[48:50] the other by going to church and doing
[48:53] good is not something that you do
[48:55] yourself it's something in you that is
[48:58] doing it for you the holy spirit in your
[49:02] heart so both of them go to church both
[49:05] of them but one is by law and rigid and
[49:07] after a while amen is that that that
[49:10] person it just it's just not as it's not
[49:12] as real to them but the one who is in
[49:16] fellowship with God communion with God
[49:20] church becomes something that is not law
[49:24] or legal it becomes something that we
[49:28] long for we want in our lives it's that
[49:32] it's that new birth on the inside of us
[49:36] and there is a relationship with you and
[49:38] God can you say amen he says in this
[49:41] inner Court these people that live
[49:43] inside he says they seem to always be
[49:45] fed up always feeling good Ezekiel says
[49:48] I will write my laws a new in their
[49:50] heart amen where the law where did the
[49:52] law used to be on stones in the ark and
[49:54] the Ark represents the heart this I will
[49:57] put my law in their heart in that Ark
[50:00] amen the heart is the abold of God oh
[50:05] hallelujah amen he says the Old
[50:07] Testament God dwelt In His glory over
[50:10] the ark and the AR heart is the ark God
[50:12] dwells not in the head in the heart God
[50:15] is not known by theology he is not known
[50:18] by mental conception God is known by an
[50:21] oldfashioned Sanctified Born Again
[50:24] experience that comes in that human
[50:26] heart heart oh Hallelujah can you say
[50:29] amen he says now yet men and women live
[50:32] a good life and love God by mental
[50:33] conception but the real hiding place is
[50:38] in the heart hid with Christ amen I now
[50:42] we're going to preach on renewing here
[50:44] tonight that soul that soul is where
[50:48] it's at that soul is where God visits
[50:51] that soul is where amen Eternal desires
[50:55] are met that soul is where genuine rest
[50:58] is at amen that soul is where every man
[51:01] and woman amen there is where we
[51:05] fellowship with God Amen when Christ the
[51:08] holy spirit in your heart he is in you
[51:11] with your temperament he's living his
[51:13] own life to his own will through you
[51:16] Hallelujah know that sounds awful but
[51:18] it's right Christ you're so yielded you
[51:21] are that Christ speaks the kind of words
[51:24] he would speak and he thinks the kind of
[51:26] thoughts that he would think through you
[51:29] he does the kind of works he would do
[51:31] through you you are yielded and resting
[51:35] what a beautiful picture of a
[51:37] consecrated Christian yielded and Christ
[51:41] working
[51:43] through no Struggle No work no labor it
[51:48] is just Christ Living himself through
[51:51] you why because he's found your soul and
[51:55] your soul is content with him amen now
[51:59] the mind will never allow that it'll
[52:01] always be a struggle you'll always be
[52:05] amen counteracting God's word you'll
[52:07] always amen be and and God can't use you
[52:11] that way amen although he you you you're
[52:14] a good man a good Christian a good this
[52:16] or that but God wants you to enter into
[52:20] his rest where he does the
[52:23] labor and you do the
[52:25] resting well that sounds like a deal to
[52:28] me let him do the working and I do the
[52:31] yielding let him do the fulfilling and I
[52:34] do the believing let him do the healing
[52:37] and I'm just here Amen to believe every
[52:40] word that he has promised and that's the
[52:43] way we receive any promise of God we're
[52:46] not struggling he's doing the work we
[52:49] are
[52:50] resting Hallelujah he says Paul amen
[52:54] said to me to uh to me to live is Christ
[52:57] and to die is gain not me that liveth
[52:59] anymore but Christ liveth in me Christ
[53:02] Living in the individual so surrendered
[53:04] when Christ speaks through the lips
[53:06] thinks through the Mind sees Through The
[53:08] Eyes acts through the temperament
[53:10] Hallelujah then the things of the world
[53:12] is passed away how can it be anything
[53:14] but sweet and pleasant all the time it's
[53:16] Christ has control amen you see it you
[53:20] that's what it is it's Christ in you
[53:23] Christ in you he says again amen well
[53:26] you say well I I believe that to be the
[53:28] truth brother brandom amen that's right
[53:30] it's in there but but it has to be here
[53:34] if it is then your whole makeup is
[53:36] Christ your attitude your desires your
[53:39] appetite your everything is Christ
[53:41] yielded and there he goes again resting
[53:45] everything perfect I'm still talking a
[53:48] little bit on resting here tonight I I
[53:50] want my soul to be at rest I want oh in
[53:53] the midst of the storm to be able to
[53:55] Amen to call Leo the Lion over there and
[53:58] lay down on on on my problem and rest
[54:02] amen right there where no matter where
[54:03] I'm at whether I'm in the Lion's Den or
[54:06] the or the fiery furnace or amen I don't
[54:09] care where I'm at Lord let me have rest
[54:14] no matter what the situation is
[54:16] believing in you well Hallelujah glory
[54:19] to God Amen how how are you defeating
[54:21] the enemy because you have yielded and
[54:24] found rest and you have allowed Christ
[54:26] to fight through you you're not trying
[54:28] to figure out how you're going to get
[54:29] healed you're not trying to figure out
[54:31] how your CH your sons or daughters are
[54:33] going to be saved all you're doing is
[54:35] just believing and thanking God and
[54:36] confessing that it's going to be done
[54:39] let God do the hard work I don't know
[54:41] how he's going to save your son or your
[54:43] daughter I don't know how he's going to
[54:44] bring them in but I promise you this one
[54:46] thing here amen if he's doing the work
[54:49] and not you then it's going to come to
[54:51] pass amen and he's going to get all the
[54:53] glory and you're going to do all the
[54:55] resting

[55:14] manufacturing I say resting not trying
[55:18] to figure it
[55:19] out amen hallelujah brother Brenham says
[55:23] Christianity is not something you know
[55:25] God's not not one that uh God is not one
[55:29] you have to beg and cry and plead and
[55:33] fast and starve everything like that to
[55:36] get it to get to certainly not amen he
[55:39] goes on and says but then but in the
[55:41] grace God has given to us freely as we
[55:45] have need everything that we have need

[58:26] it gets so much and then it goes to
[58:28] pushing out it drinks some more amen
[58:30] drinks more than it's a lotted portion
[58:32] it swells out it pushes out limbs it
[58:35] pushes out buds it pushes out leaves
[58:38] then it blossoms then apples then it
[58:40] pushes again and it pushes again just
[58:43] keeps drinking drinking drinking till it
[58:46] just pushes out and that's the way the
[58:48] Christian does when you're planted in
[58:50] Christ Jesus everything you have need of
[58:54] in this Earth's journey I want to shout
[58:56] right now is in you when you receive the
[59:00] Holy Ghost hallelujah amen so what are
[59:03] you doing you are fellowshipping that
[59:06] now this is where the Christian
[59:09] experience is lacking today is because
[59:12] we've got so much other things to keep
[59:15] us busy and we miss out on the
[59:18] relationship if you're going to produce
[59:21] the apples you've got to drink the water
[59:26] can you say Amen now when you do if you
[59:28] don't then you're going back mentally
[59:31] amen you're coming to church mentally
[59:33] you're going you're doing the things
[59:35] mentally God does not want this to be
[59:38] religion he wants this to be
[59:41] relationship relationship produces Life
[59:45] religion produces ritual amen
[59:48] relationship is where God comes to meet
[59:51] with his sons and daughters oh
[59:55] Hallelujah aren't you glad for that
[59:57] tonight amen relationship God wants to
[1:00:01] fellowship with
[1:00:02] you amen he says now when you're planted
[1:00:05] in Christ everything you have need of is
[1:00:08] is in you the only thing you have to do
[1:00:11] drink drink push out push out just drink
[1:00:15] till you have to just drink out till you
[1:00:19] can't drink no more if you need Divine
[1:00:21] Healing go to God's word and drink from
[1:00:23] it until you push out if you need if you
[1:00:26] need more of God keep drinking and
[1:00:28] pushing out Christ is the inexhaustible
[1:00:31] Fountain of Life if you're planted in
[1:00:33] him the only thing you have to do is
[1:00:36] drink of his goodness and push out
[1:00:38] whatever you have need of in this life's
[1:00:40] journey it is all somebody say it with
[1:00:43] me
[1:00:44] drinking
[1:00:46] resting and peace now that's exactly
[1:00:49] what brother brandom said let's say it
[1:00:50] again it's
[1:00:51] all
[1:00:53] drinking resting and peace
[1:00:58] drinking resting and peace amen that's
[1:01:03] what God is look just drinking of his
[1:01:04] promises relationship with God Amen just
[1:01:07] a wonderful Fellowship there is
[1:01:09] something about the soul that is craving
[1:01:13] more of God feed your soul with more of
[1:01:20] God hallelujah it's not he says it's not
[1:01:23] what you struggle and strive and pull at
[1:01:28] you defeat the very purpose that you're
[1:01:31] representing when you do
[1:01:34] that
[1:01:36] now so what is the secret brother
[1:01:38] brandham says it's very simple and you
[1:01:40] can find it in the Bible he
[1:01:42] says it
[1:01:44] is
[1:01:46] drinking
[1:01:48] fellowshipping it's that
[1:01:51] Soul you're giving that Soul what it's
[1:01:54] craving
[1:01:55] it's
[1:01:57] craving fellowship with God your mind
[1:02:00] don't want it your body don't want it
[1:02:04] but your soul well praise the Lord
[1:02:08] sometimes you can you can amen you just
[1:02:11] you just get all nervous you get up
[1:02:12] tight you wonder amen and and and and
[1:02:15] and so you know you'll put a little
[1:02:17] movie on or you'll you you'll you'll uh
[1:02:20] uh you you'll put a you know your you'll
[1:02:22] go and eat a nice big old steak or you
[1:02:25] amen but you find it's not really
[1:02:27] satisfying it's not taking care of it
[1:02:29] it's because there is God is wanting
[1:02:32] relationship with
[1:02:35] you can you say Amen what was what what
[1:02:39] how many believes that Israel there in
[1:02:41] Egypt and The Exodus was a type of this
[1:02:44] Exodus and what did they do amen when
[1:02:47] they found that God was blessing the
[1:02:49] children of Israel and they were
[1:02:50] multiplying amen what did Pharaoh do
[1:02:53] Pharaoh said they are they are they have
[1:02:56] too much time on their hands make them
[1:03:00] more
[1:03:03] busy amen and then they says we're not
[1:03:06] giving you bricks anymore to build now
[1:03:08] you're going to have to make your own
[1:03:08] bricks so then now now there's down the
[1:03:10] Slime pits trying to do and what were
[1:03:12] they doing God him so busy they didn't
[1:03:14] have time for prayer they didn't have
[1:03:15] time for family they didn't have time
[1:03:17] for victory they didn't have time for
[1:03:19] any of those things well can you say
[1:03:20] amen and that's what the devil wants to
[1:03:22] do with us today he wants to take your
[1:03:24] time because your soul needs that
[1:03:26] quality time with
[1:03:29] God Amen getting alone with
[1:03:32] God Amen it's like you're renewed in the
[1:03:36] it's a it's it's a renewing time for you

[1:04:59] I even say that but there's a you know
[1:05:01] the you know movies have crept into the
[1:05:04] church amen and so it doesn't do me any
[1:05:07] good to preach against the movies

[1:05:56] your soul can have
[1:05:59] relationship with
[1:06:01] God how many believes that's all right
[1:06:04] he said that's the reason that's the
[1:06:05] reason the spirit is not operating the
[1:06:07] church amen the way it is among the
[1:06:09] people is because there's a lot be a lot
[1:06:12] of it because of irreverence people
[1:06:14] don't respect it they don't respect
[1:06:16] anything that God says he says uh uh

[1:06:57] it's it's to know the law of life is
[1:07:01] inside you and you just let go and let
[1:07:04] God Amen then he takes you to your
[1:07:07] healing takes you to the baptism of the
[1:07:09] spirit or anything else that he's

[1:07:52] the justification season or the
[1:07:54] sanctification season or the 1906
[1:07:57] baptism season he has placed you in the
[1:07:59] adoption Rapture season this is your
[1:08:03] season and I just want to let the devil
[1:08:05] know there is nothing that can Fort the
[1:08:08] purpose of God in God's people because
[1:08:11] they've got a soul that is going to
[1:08:13] hunger for God more than this flesh is
[1:08:16] hungering for sin and easy and pleasure
[1:08:20] amen there is a soul that is longing
[1:08:23] more for God
[1:08:27] how many believes
[1:08:28] that man how many can how many can give
[1:08:32] me a witness that amen you've made the
[1:08:34] money but it didn't
[1:08:36] satisfy how many can witness that you've
[1:08:39] you've had the nice things but it didn't
[1:08:41] satisfy you've had your popularity but
[1:08:43] it didn't satisfy you'll never be
[1:08:46] satisfied because you are a son of God
[1:08:50] Amen and the only thing that is ever
[1:08:52] going to satisfy you is not that new
[1:08:55] home home amen that you're that you're
[1:08:57] working so hard for not that new card
[1:08:59] it's not in the things amen the only
[1:09:02] thing that is going to satisfied the
[1:09:03] Bride of Jesus Christ is relationship
[1:09:06] and fellowship with God you communing
[1:09:09] with him and him communing with you
[1:09:11] there is where satisfaction comes
[1:09:17] from Brother brandom My Redeemer he says
[1:09:21] God's purpose can never be defeated
[1:09:23] someone say hallelujah there is nothing
[1:09:26] can defeat it how happy we ought to be
[1:09:28] this day resting upon the beautiful
[1:09:30] revelation of the word of the Living God
[1:09:32] that there is neither things present or
[1:09:34] things to that can come there's no
[1:09:36] sickness there's no sorrow no death no
[1:09:38] pearls no nothing else can separate us
[1:09:40] from the purpose of the Living God Amen
[1:09:42] as I was preaching this morning amen
[1:09:44] it's it's it's with without the seed of
[1:09:46] promise there is no expectation amen and
[1:09:50] without expectation there is no
[1:09:52] preparation so what did God do God sent
[1:09:55] a prophet in this day amen to prepare
[1:09:58] your heart to give you the promise to
[1:10:00] tell you you're not one of them you're
[1:10:03] not the average girl you are the
[1:10:05] beautiful chosen bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:08] you were predestinated for the throne
[1:10:10] God gave that promise to you amen and
[1:10:13] what is that promise doing it's creating
[1:10:15] expectation in your heart it's creating
[1:10:18] something within you every day that you
[1:10:20] live that God does want to fellowship
[1:10:22] with me that God does want to commune
[1:10:25] with me me that God does want to use me
[1:10:28] and anoint me it gives me an
[1:10:30] expectation therefore I prepare for that
[1:10:35] by entering into that secret place with
[1:10:38] God
[1:10:42] waiting somebody looked at your neighbor
[1:10:44] and says are you

[1:11:03] organization and education and the world
[1:11:05] of religion that as John the Baptist and
[1:11:07] Elijah of old he will hear from God Amen
[1:11:11] uh and he will have thus saith the Lord
[1:11:13] and speak for God he will be God's mouth
[1:11:15] P piece and he as it is declared in
[1:11:18] Malachi four and six will turn the
[1:11:20] hearts of the children back to the
[1:11:22] fathers he will bring back that elect of
[1:11:25] the last days and they will hear a
[1:11:28] Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth
[1:11:30] as it was with Paul and he will resal
[1:11:33] restore the truth as they had it and
[1:11:35] those elect with him in that day will be
[1:11:39] the ones who truly manifest the Lord and
[1:11:43] be his body and be his voice and perform
[1:11:48] his works there is nothing can anal That

[1:12:08] struggle according to uh Hebrews the
[1:12:11] fourth chapter there is a amen there
[1:12:14] there is a struggle to enter into that
[1:12:17] rest there's where Satan wants to get us

[1:13:17] directing your
[1:13:21] paths but if we would recognize that

[1:27:30] psalmist who walks so closely with the
[1:27:35] Lord was going through the valley it was
[1:27:39] not that God had forsaken him and it was
[1:27:43] that there was so much around him the
[1:27:46] web had spent that web and that web
[1:27:49] around me there was so much going on
[1:27:53] that it seemed like his
[1:27:55] Soul he couldn't he was having a hard
[1:27:57] time settling down his mind he was
[1:27:59] having a hard time settling down
[1:28:01] everything stopping
[1:28:04] everything so that he could commune with
[1:28:07] God God never leaves God never forsakes
[1:28:10] you say brother w we can't yes you can
[1:28:11] we got to we've got to find that quiet
[1:28:14] place we've got I don't care how busy we
[1:28:16] are we've got to keep that
[1:28:18] Soul free from the
[1:28:22] vibrations can you say man
[1:28:25] Elijah got so
[1:28:28] weary there he was walking with
[1:28:31] God Ravens feeding
[1:28:34] him walking with God such an incredible
[1:28:38] thing God performing miracles for the
[1:28:40] Widow such an incredible
[1:28:44] thing comes up to those that the the the
[1:28:48] the prophets of Baal
[1:28:54] God comes down and visits by the pillar
[1:28:56] of fire the situation I mean God comes
[1:28:59] down and it's just and he kills a 450
[1:29:02] prophets
[1:29:11] amen but then when Jezebel heard about
[1:29:13] it and she got mad because her prophets
[1:29:15] were
[1:29:16] killed she said so be it to
[1:29:21] me she swore by her gods that she was
[1:29:23] going to kill
[1:29:26] him it caused a vibration and he got so
[1:29:30] weary he got so
[1:29:32] tired brother brandham would say Elijah
[1:29:35] knew that his God was real so he had
[1:29:37] brought it to a showdown but when the
[1:29:40] people had turned down the supernatural
[1:29:41] sign there was nothing to it the
[1:29:45] lightning must have struck Jezebel made
[1:29:47] her threats and all of her gang they
[1:29:50] didn't want to give up their social
[1:29:51] societies and little old Eli just heart
[1:29:54] was broke any Minister knows what Monday
[1:29:57] morning is after a hard day on Sunday
[1:30:01] compare that you Preachers Wives you
[1:30:03] know how how your husband is on Monday
[1:30:05] after he's preached hard two or three
[1:30:07] times Sunday he's so wore out what do
[1:30:10] you think that about poor little old
[1:30:12] Elijah there he was no one to comfort
[1:30:15] him he stopped under the juniper tree
[1:30:17] and he knelt down and looked up to God
[1:30:19] and said Lord I'm so tired and I'm so
[1:30:21] weary why don't you just take my life
[1:30:23] and let me go go my father's all went so
[1:30:25] let me go men who deal in that
[1:30:27] Supernatural who stay in the presence of
[1:30:29] God who who who when when you see God's
[1:30:32] program turned down and you preach it
[1:30:34] and you try your best and you do
[1:30:35] everything that God tells you to do and
[1:30:37] they still walk away from it it's
[1:30:38] heartbreaking but God Almighty has done
[1:30:41] enough here in the Angeles Temple this
[1:30:43] last week till it had Los Angeles set a
[1:30:47] fire no wonder he said it'll be more
[1:30:49] tolerable for solom and Gomorrah in the
[1:30:51] day of judgment and the little poor the
[1:30:54] poor little fella skinny lay there his
[1:30:56] gray hair hanging on his
[1:30:59] shoulders he said my servants God says
[1:31:02] my servant needs some rest God's mercy
[1:31:05] to his servants he just laid him down on
[1:31:08] a bunch of weeds and he went to sleep
[1:31:10] and I'd imagine there were 10,000 angels
[1:31:12] watching him sleep there was one
[1:31:15] Assurance there's one Assurance the
[1:31:17] believer has though the World Turns You
[1:31:19] Down God still loves him the world may
[1:31:23] call you Holy
[1:31:24] Roller and may call you
[1:31:27] fanatic but you're true to God there's
[1:31:30] one thing sure uh but if you're true to
[1:31:32] God there's one thing sure God loves you
[1:31:35] and his angels are encamped around those
[1:31:37] that fear Him someone say hallelujah he
[1:31:39] said I would imagine on every limb all
[1:31:41] around through the place with swarms of
[1:31:43] angels God come down and he said my poor
[1:31:46] little tired servant he's so nervous and
[1:31:48] tore up he don't know what to do I want
[1:31:51] to pick out the angel standing there
[1:31:53] that got the softest hands don't you
[1:31:56] scare him walk over and stroke his brow
[1:31:58] right easy I want the best cook among
[1:32:01] you go up there get all the vitamins you
[1:32:03] can find and put in the cornmeal the
[1:32:06] world's turned him down but I'm going to
[1:32:08] treat him right Hallelujah that means
[1:32:10] praise our God don't get scared of that
[1:32:12] bring forth the best that we caught cook
[1:32:15] him a corn cake set him set him down
[1:32:18] some water and this soft-handed Angel
[1:32:20] went over and stroked the little servant
[1:32:22] of God on the brow remember if you've
[1:32:25] done your best God still got those
[1:32:29] angels in order he loves you just the
[1:32:33] same as he loved
[1:32:41] Elijah God God PL called that Elijah and
[1:32:44] that was a high calling and you'll never
[1:32:46] achieve
[1:32:48] that but the reason God called
[1:32:51] Elijah because he had some people that
[1:32:53] he loved
[1:32:55] you'll never be the seven Church age
[1:32:59] messenger but I promise you you're the
[1:33:02] reason he sent the seventh Church age
[1:33:10] messenger god put him through strict and
[1:33:13] training and I mean put him through the
[1:33:15] fire so that he would bring you a gospel
[1:33:19] that would be
[1:33:22] unadulterated he didn't have a family
[1:33:24] that he could come home to every night
[1:33:26] he wasn't able to raise his children
[1:33:28] like he wanted to you do God loves you
[1:33:33] God sent us a prophet so that you boys
[1:33:36] can know how to pick out your girls God
[1:33:38] sent us a prophet amen so that you
[1:33:41] children can know and appreciate your
[1:33:43] Mam and daddies God sent us a prophet
[1:33:46] amen so that you will know what kind of
[1:33:47] a Preacher to have behind your Pulpit
[1:33:50] God sent you a prophet God done this cuz
[1:33:53] he loves
[1:33:56] you he wants an intact family he wants
[1:33:59] you to have peace he wants you to be
[1:34:02] joyful he wants you to have love he
[1:34:05] wants you to have
[1:34:11] that God wants peace to be
[1:34:21] yours when brother Brandon was laying
[1:34:24] there and someone there was he fixing to
[1:34:26] die in the car wreck and someone said
[1:34:31] hey wh why don't
[1:34:33] he why don't he pray for
[1:34:37] himself he laid his hands on sister
[1:34:40] Brandon there someone says that I mean I
[1:34:42] it's not in tape he never preached
[1:34:43] another message after that but he
[1:34:45] someone says he laid his hand they laid
[1:34:47] his hands on sister brandom and the Lord
[1:34:49] brought her back from life so he was
[1:34:51] alive enough to do that
[1:34:55] but then he said the gift is not for
[1:34:59] me the gift was for
[1:35:02] you
[1:35:04] God remember if you have done your best
[1:35:07] God still got those angels in order he
[1:35:09] loves you the same as he loved
[1:35:11] Elijah he loves you mamas when you're
[1:35:14] tired he loves you daddies when you're
[1:35:16] when when when when you're when your
[1:35:18] spirits are all vibrating he loves you
[1:35:20] children when you're going through amen
[1:35:22] you're from changing from a boy to a to
[1:35:24] a man he in a girl to a a young lady he
[1:35:28] he loves you he loves you he knows where
[1:35:31] you are he's been
[1:35:39] there he says he stroked his brow and
[1:35:41] Elijah woke up and I may hear him say
[1:35:44] something like this Lord the Lord your
[1:35:47] God who loves you youve done your best
[1:35:50] Elijah I only sent those signs for a
[1:35:53] witness in that that day of the judgment
[1:35:55] and they'll have to stand
[1:35:57] alone You' done just what I told you to
[1:35:59] do and I know you're tired and weary now
[1:36:03] and the Lord God creator of heavens and
[1:36:05] earth has sent me to feed you this bread
[1:36:07] and
[1:36:08] water Elijah rubbing his eyes and
[1:36:10] raising up just little frail shaking
[1:36:13] hands took a hold of the bread and eat
[1:36:15] it and just then the great Angelic choir
[1:36:18] come out and formed a little panoramic
[1:36:20] around him like that and begin to sing
[1:36:22] the songs like no mother could CP her
[1:36:25] baby to sleep let him sleep again then
[1:36:28] father turned around and said you know I
[1:36:30] love him so much the journey is great he
[1:36:32] has got a lot to go through with yet and
[1:36:35] I'm not through with him so I got to
[1:36:37] feed him again so he called the angels
[1:36:39] and dumped in another big bundle of
[1:36:42] vitamins and cooked another corn cake
[1:36:44] and set him in a cruise of water and
[1:36:46] stroked his brow and fed him again I'm
[1:36:49] so glad that there is a juniper tree
[1:36:52] when we get all wore and tore up we can
[1:36:56] go under the juniper tree and find
[1:36:58] spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of
[1:37:01] a
[1:37:03] trip he loves
[1:37:05] you he loves
[1:37:09] you are you hearing me there come a time
[1:37:12] that brother Bram needed to hear it
[1:37:14] again there come a time that there was a
[1:37:17] time it reminds me before I before I go
[1:37:20] there it reminds me of Abraham God came

[1:37:28] great nation and the and the and and the
[1:37:30] world will be blessed by by your seed

[1:42:31] everyone renew Every
[1:42:34] Soul we fought a lot of battles
[1:42:39] lately but we're
[1:42:43] here none of those things of the world
[1:42:45] has ever been
[1:42:48] able to take that desire away in fact
[1:42:51] the desire has been more
[1:42:55] intense whether you fallen or whether
[1:42:57] you've got distractions all around you
[1:42:59] or whatever it is there is something
[1:43:01] about your soul that is screaming

[1:43:40] here he said what makes the trees to
[1:43:45] Bud he said it's a
[1:43:49] refreshment what makes the refreshing
[1:43:53] he says early in the morning you go out
[1:43:55] early in the morning and you find out
[1:43:58] after the night everything settles gets
[1:44:00] real
[1:44:01] Ste then the de
[1:44:04] Falls and it brings a
[1:44:07] refreshing another place is the trouble
[1:44:10] of it is today people don't have time to
[1:44:13] get before God and get still there's so
[1:44:15] many things to do and they belong to
[1:44:18] this and they got to do this and they've
[1:44:19] got to have that and they've got to go
[1:44:22] there you don't have the time and the
[1:44:24] devil's just took up all of your time
[1:44:26] and you don't have time to get still
[1:44:28] before God and get
[1:44:31] quiet another place he says remember
[1:44:33] after all you're a
[1:44:35] nature and after all nature gets quiet
[1:44:38] and
[1:44:40] still then the de begins to fall and
[1:44:42] that refreshes and brings forth
[1:44:45] life and you're a nature
[1:44:47] yourself and when you get
[1:44:50] quiet and still before God
[1:44:54] then the D of Heaven begins to
[1:44:57] fall and begins to
[1:45:00] refresh how many wants are refreshing
[1:45:02] from the
[1:45:04] Lord we got the meeting coming
[1:45:07] up I want us
[1:45:10] to steal

[1:45:47] have amen
[1:46:02] our answer is not outside of us our
[1:46:04] answer is
[1:46:06] inside the king lives
[1:46:09] inside refreshment is inside all we have
[1:46:12] to

[1:48:17] life the purpose of God in your life
[1:48:21] will not be defeated
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:28] all of the could have would have should
[1:48:29] us everything in the
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:43] past at one time I would look to my
[1:48:47] dad in certain situations and I would
[1:48:50] say Dad I why did you
[1:48:53] why did you keep us in this in this
[1:48:56] situation why did you stay there in
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:03] this when you were done wrong and you
[1:49:07] were
[1:49:09] hurt you were neglected and you were
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:23] as a kid preacher I
[1:49:26] said just blows me
[1:49:34] away he said I had a purpose I wasn't
[1:49:36] going to do anything outside of hearing
[1:49:38] from the
[1:49:39] Lord and I wasn't going to pull my
[1:49:41] children out
[1:49:43] of be torn from Pillar To Post I wasn't
[1:49:46] going to you on
[1:49:48] E he said but we lived a life right
[1:49:51] there in front of everyone we lived that
[1:49:55] [Music]
[1:49:58] life because of that God shown his
[1:50:02] grace you boys are ministers of the
[1:50:05] Gospel Alena is a
[1:50:09] wonderful servant of
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:16] God you
[1:50:19] grew in your struggles
[1:50:28] and it was important that I held my head
[1:50:32] right and kept my head straight and
[1:50:35] walked with
[1:50:36] God the way that he was leading
[1:50:40] me to show you boys how it's
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:48] done as a kid preacher didn't mean a
[1:50:50] whole bunch but now that I'm getting a
[1:50:52] little bit older a little bit
[1:50:55] wiser I'm looking at the stability that
[1:50:58] God gave because somebody who was in the
[1:51:04] storms in the storms and the winds and
[1:51:08] that yet
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:12] chose keep that soul in communion with
[1:51:16] God are y'all hearing
[1:51:19] me that's why we don't jump out of the
[1:51:22] tribe that's why we don't jump out of
[1:51:24] the
[1:51:26] situations and you don't want
[1:51:30] it you want to find the lily of the
[1:51:32] valley while you're in the
[1:51:34] valley you want to find the great Pillar
[1:51:37] of Fire right there with you in the
[1:51:40] Lion's
[1:51:43] Den it's in those places that we
[1:51:45] experience God in a great great great
[1:51:48] great wonderful
[1:51:50] way can you say Amen
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:55] why
[1:51:58] sometimes as
[1:52:01] brother Merl said tonight sometimes God
[1:52:05] brings things for
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:08] desperation he allows the situations to
[1:52:10] come he
[1:52:11] allows because God wants to pull us
[1:52:13] closer to
[1:52:15] him can you say Amen to
[1:52:19] that I want us to
[1:52:23] look in our hearts here tonight
[1:52:30] and if you've got any of those
[1:52:32] vibrations in your spirit that's that's
[1:52:35] keeping you nervous keeping you keeping
[1:52:38] your mind I want you to repent of that
[1:52:42] tonight anything
[1:52:46] that's that you're allowing
[1:52:50] to to keep you
[1:52:53] I want you tonight to say Lord I'm going
[1:52:55] to give that to
[1:52:57] you I'm going to rest in you I I'm want
[1:53:00] to I'm going to fast from everything
[1:53:02] else and I I I I I I want
[1:53:06] to I want to come in contact with you
[1:53:13] Lord the busy person says well if I
[1:53:16] wasn't so busy the person that's not so
[1:53:19] busy says if I wasn't so busy
[1:53:23] we never have we never have that
[1:53:27] time we're always going to be busy
[1:53:30] whether we're running around or whether
[1:53:31] we're setting
[1:53:34] still the vibrations of spirit that

[1:53:39] there's others that can be busy working
[1:53:42] taking care of the family providing for
[1:53:44] their
[1:53:46] families that yet have that place with
