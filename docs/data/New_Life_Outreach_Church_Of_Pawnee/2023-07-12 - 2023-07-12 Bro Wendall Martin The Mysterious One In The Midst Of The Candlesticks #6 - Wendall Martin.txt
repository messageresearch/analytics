and um and and I'm just going to um there in the 10th verse I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and I heard and behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last amen how many glad he's the half and Omega the first and the last amen and so then we want to go on down let's just go on down to the 13th verse in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and was gerd about the paps with the golden girdle his his head and his hair is wide as wool white as snow eyes were like flames of fire his feet like fine brass his voice is the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth what a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun that shineth in his strength amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you tonight for your love thank you for your grace and your presence that we feel here tonight Lord we appreciate this opportunity that we can come together and so good to have uh sister Mast and the mass family with us Lord and and I pray that you'll bless them while they're here in Oklahoma and Lord we're just so thankful for all of your goodness Lord good to see Dad here tonight and we're just thanking you for total healing for him Lord we're just asking that you would help us as we Minister your word this evening be with us in all that we do and say in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen so these these Wednesday nights we've been um uh we've been going through this um through these studies on the study on the mysterious one in the walking in the midst of the candlesticks and um we have um uh we this last week we dealt with a man out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and um and of course now on these Wednesday nights again we're not um uh this is this is sort of um uh you know you're free to ask questions lift your hands or anything like that where it's gonna we're trying to do this as a Bible study type setting and so if you have any questions um or you know some people say well I get my questions when I get back home well write them down and then we can ask them we can ask ask the questions when we come back in because there are no stupid questions amen and so if you have anything we we want you to make sure you you say so um we have we have talked about this um I I didn't quite I wanted to just deal a little bit more on uh out of his mouth now we had uh I believe it was the the fourth personage of Christ was amen his voice uh was the voice of the sound of many Waters and of course we went through his voice as multitudes people Nations tongues amen this this is his voice the man uh would would have would have the sound of the multitudes speaking and um and then this last week we as we dealt with out of his mouth also a two-edged sword and of course the sword is is a weapon man you think of Warfare when you think of the sword um amen and um uh and how will the Antichrist be destroyed the Antichrist was going to be destroyed by his mouth now the scripture says there in second Thessalonians to an eight it says then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and so we understand that these words that you're we're not the word uh the Bible is not just words men but it is a Living Word so everything that we see here this person of Christ is the living logos it's the Living Word it's the anointing so what we are seeing amen and brother Branham would say even in one place he said that one that's walking in the midst of the candlesticks is is a type of the Bride so it's what it is it's the anointing it's the Holy Spirit working through seven churches the seven Church ages it's it's one two it's two thousand years it's one church but it's in it's in seven different stages and and so God broke it down uh uh so that you and I could see it so it's one church it's over it it spans over 2000 years but he is he is bringing it down to the sevens amen so that he can show his his uh what he's doing in each period of time we understand that seven in the Bible seven is a is the number of completion can you say Amen so so if we as as we review Once Again the man that this mysterious one who is he he's the living word amen that's the logos that created all things amen it's that it's that logos that said let there be and brother random says it could have been a thousand years before the sun actually came about amen he said when he said uh when he was bringing the seeds up out of the ground he said that logos hovered over the seeds and was bringing him to pass it was the logos that created uh uh Adam in the death of the earth so amen so the scripture says he is before all things amen he's the creator of all things and by him all things exist he is Alpha and Omega he'll be before he'll be after can you say man and so Jesus was the logos made flesh so the spirit of the word The Man created a body and that Holy Spirit moved on the inside of that being he become the very body of God now amen so the the mystery is the mystery is is not Jesus Jesus is not the mystery anymore we know who Jesus is Jesus is the son of God Amen and when and he and the father are one when you go to when you go to heaven you're not going to see two Gods you're going to see how many gods one God Amen God lives in the body of Jesus Christ they're synonymous they'll never more be separate amen they are while he was on the earth he says now I do nothing except my father first show me my father in me does the works can you say Amen now but this mysterious one that is walking in the candlesticks it's God living in human beings in the redeemed that's what God is trying to show throughout the church ages it's God living himself through the first church second Church Third Church fourth Church fifth sixth seventh Church it's God living in you now that's what that's what he's doing God's living his life through you now he done it through Christ to redeem you hallelujah amen but now through the Holy Spirit he's living in you amen so brother uh brother Branham would say the word is God the spirit is God they are all one one cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God so so now what he's saying when you receive the Holy Ghost the word for your day is lived in you oh Hallelujah Jesus wasn't a bit worried he was the son of God Amen he said search the scriptures they declare who I am I'm here fulfilling them brother Branham says I I'm not they said are you worried when you come to the platform are you worried you're going to miss it no he knew he was Malachi 4. the word was living through him he could say beyond the shadow of a doubt I'm the Elijah Hallelujah why did Elijah come to turn the hearts of the elect back to so you and I can stand and say I am that heart I am very late I am that word amen and the Holy Spirit is here to make that word to live so the Holy Ghost is what it's the spirit of the letter so what the letter is the the the logos is the spirit it's the living part that makes the letter to live well glory to God what what what is it when we look at healing when we're asking for healing or we're electing we're looking for these things we're simply expecting the Holy Spirit to get in this this letter here and make it to live can you say amen amen so amen so uh Jesus would say they're at the uh in John 6 and 63 I believe it is he says uh uh you can you can put it up there the words that I speak uh unto you are spirit and they are alive so here he is again here's the words their spirit and their life don't set in a church and learning doctrines and have no life God's desire is for his word to become life to you and to me can you say Amen so so as we go on I want us to just stop for a few a few min and I want us to look at this map calls amen it's the this this this mysterious one this mysterious one when he opened his word to speak amen it was as it was it was as the multitudes it was amen the words uh were were like the voice of many Waters amen so in order and and we know that was multitude so that's the Holy Spirit living and resting in you so you you when you are you you we were all born in sin we were all shaping and iniquity um we have a lot of our mama and our Daddy's uh genetics in us we're born we're born Sinners is that right and yet God wants to redeem that's what their savior done that's why Christ came God Came In the Flesh God Came In the Flesh reconciling the world is that what he said God in Christ reconciling the world to himself so he came to pay the price to bring you back to himself so that he could redeem you live in you you are no more yourself there's back there let's just turn there real quickly um they're in First Corinthians 6 and 18. praise the Lord Hallelujah First Corinthians 6 and 18 and we'll wait till you youngans get there and when you get there you can say Amen praise the Lord okay so it says free fornication for every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what no you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God ye are not your own ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit with your Gods can you say Amen so now here here God is so we when we are when we are filled with the Holy Ghost amen we we he's he's he's igniting something within us I I wanted to um brother Branham make some statements here and he and he takes there in John and if you want to turn uh John 20 and 21 and then you'll you'll understand where we're going for a few moments uh John 20 and and 21 [Music] praise the Lord he says then Jesus said unto them peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so I send you now um now brother Brandon would say now watch the father that sent him went in him and he says and and he says as he sends his disciples he goes in them it's the same one he says when he had said this this is the 22nd verse and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whoever's whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained so now here we're going back to the Breath of God I'm wanting to really deal with the spirit of his mouth amen he breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost amen now this is I think I think this is important because the church is going to have to speak now catch this the church the voice of many Waters you are going to be the The Seven Ages God is going to be speaking through the church so God is breathing his breath upon the elect when you receive the Holy Ghost brother Branham says it is God breathing his breath like he did unto uh into your nostrils as he did unto Adam brother Breton would say the church is the mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God he said do you get it the Church of God is born of the Breath of God that God breathed breath into the nostril spiritually of Adam and he become a living Soul did you know the Pentecostals are the two the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God amen so so I now now this is this is beautiful because here we are this mysterious one hey man he's got the wig uh he's he's he's got the eyes of fire he's going through all of these he's we're going we've gone down through his personages and but when he is speaking it is as the sound of many Waters and this is so this so confounds the people did you know that the that they could not accept Christ being the son of God they could not accept that the father God of all glory would speak through a mortal man and did you know that that's still a hard thing today God's speaking through a mortal lip it's hard to get people to believe a prophet it's hard to get them to believe Malachi 4. because it's that they want the Holy Spirit to come and speak to them amen but God has a way a plan in doing it can you say Amen so so the whole fuss that religion had with Christ was that he himself making himself good but you see it was God in Christ making him one with himself therefore he was God reconciling the world to himself Jesus was the image of the invisible God amen what is the image of the invisible God today they're still they're God's wanting God's got to have an Earthly image his bride is the image of the invisible God now I I if you don't see that in yourself you're not seeing your position Christ placed you in a position with him a position of authority a position where his word is with you now now brother Branham would say he would say um he says now they was looking at that little body that was born of Mary see that wasn't God that was the son of God but God was in the body and it was God amen he said if I do not the works of my father then then condemn me but uh but which one of you can condemn me of sin unbelief in the word which word has God spoke that hasn't been fulfilling me sin is unbelief which one of you can accuse me of sin sin is unbelief show me if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but if I do the works though you can't believe me believe the works that I do for they testify otherwise the fathers in me testifying of himself he says now because God was in Christ reconciling the world then he ask the question do you get it so you're saying yes we get it I'm going to get that God was in Christ and you've been saying yes yes you keep saying it God's in Christ brother when do we get it but then he stops do you get it well now the same life that's in that vine is also in that branch [Applause] he said you can't join into it it's the life of the Vine so he keeps going over and over here he keeps trying to drive it home you're just as mysterious as Jesus was mysterious and you've got to see yourself in the light of the great love Goss in you it's hard for you to see that because you're still you still got a sticky nature you still got all of this but God's wanting you to see that you are his hands his feet his eyes amen is that right so so he would go on the Apostle Paul would say Christ in you the hope of glory amen all right so so brother Branham would say now how did God make the Earth he spoke it amen you see it he's fake and the world come into existence and this world this morning is the spoken word of God and he believed his own word can I hear an amen he says here it is watch it and if God and you're an offspring of him God is in you he'll believe his own word though it can't be seen felt taste anything he'll believe it see what I mean for God in you will believe his own word amen so now each age become God's voice so I and I want us to look here because each age become the voice he would send his words through an Earthly mortal messenger amen and then that Earthly mortal man would give it to the people and the people would have to receive that word from that messenger or they would miss what God was doing they had to receive it from the messenger to the age Hallelujah now now you say now now brother Wendell are are you sure about now we don't went through that he's got the Seven Stars in his hands those Seven Stars amen are the seven Messengers to the seven churches the seven spirits of God declaring himself in in a body can you say Amen now if you if the Holy Spirit has breathed his breath upon you hallelujah it's the same breath that wrote this so if he's breathed that breath upon you that it's enlightened you to see the word of your day [Music] how is it that we cannot be deceived someone says oh you're following blindly no the spirit that wrote the book has breathed upon me and open my eyes to see the word for this day do you see why you have to have the Holy Ghost in order to see the word it's that breath that spoken in the beginning are you following me amen now brother Brandon would say isn't it easy with that Spirit that's in God that's in you you be you uh you believe God can do anything and will keep his word cause you're born again the life that was in Christ is in you amen so he says isn't it easy that that spirit that was in Christ is now in you and you can believe his word for anything he says now if you just belong to the church and never born again you'll reason it then you'll never know God until his Spirit through his blood comes into your heart and then you become a new creature so so our learning our Revelation here as we're as we're going into these seven churches Church ages and by the way did you bring those uh Church age books uh by the way we've got we have got some church age books here um that that we would like to um anyone that's god well I think we've got 14 Church age books and I'd like to get some since we're getting into these Church ages I'd like for you to start reading those who don't have it so um we'll we'll deal with that a little bit later on so the multitude of these Witnesses for each age amen so we went through that it you there there was there was the seven Messengers to The Seven Ages there was the voice of the fivefold ministry who declared the gospel as delivered by the church age Messengers and then there was the millions of witnesses who lived as an open book amen and Sue uh so as we look at this amen these these voices are are uh or the the are living through you and through me so I want us to now as we as we dealt with those now let's go to the sword for just a moment and I and I want us to hit this sword that we talked about this last week Imagine because now those Living Voices the words that have been brought forth the spirit of that word amen and again you're reflecting the living Christ you know every day you go to the job you're reflecting Christ at home and and there's this there's a there's a spat between you and your wife and you and you you choose to do things the right way that's that's the Christ flowing through you that's that's love Mercy flowing through you can you say amen amen the spirit of the Lord doing those things in us now I I want us to look here um let's look here where brother Branham mentions in in Revelations four and five now we understand that the fourth chapter is um is is Judgment the the third the first three chapters was the church ages Church ages are now over door was opened up in heaven now brother Branham is telling us that the fourth chapter of Revelations is dealing with judgment and so I'm just going to read the fifth verse I want us to read that and he says and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and a voice voice says plural now this is Judgment this is Judgment but the voice says can you say Amen who is it and and there were seven lamps of burning a fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God and so we understand amen that this is that this this is going to The Seven Ages seven spirits speaking through now I I they're they're in um uh Exodus 19. and we'll turn there just real quickly we'll um for you young ones we'll wait on you Acts or Exodus 19 brother Branham tells us to go back and look in the Old Testament when God dealt with the Jews coming out of Israel or out of Egypt and um and he and he said that this this happening here in Exodus 19 chapter he says God had brought Israel out of out of bondage and um uh he had performed wonderful things but Israel wanted a law that they could live by they wanted to keep a few Commandments be good do a few good things and nice things but God wanted life and so when they but they demanded a law and so God was going to show them and I want you to look here in Exodus 19 and 16. he says and it come to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and lightning and a thick Cloud upon the mountain and the voice singular of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled and Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God and they stood on the nether part of the mountain and Mount Sinai was all together on on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it in a fire and the smoke thereof ascended as a smoke of a furnace and the whole Mount quaked greatly and when the voice singular of the trumpet sounded long and waxed longer Moses spake and God answered him with a voice and once again it is singular all right let's go to the 20th chapter in the 18th verse so here's the Judgment now when God's speaking in the Old Testament amen he is speaking seeing it's and it's thundering out of the sky out of the cloud and and and the the people are are are very nervous here in the 20th chapter of Exodus the 18th verse and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with with us lest we die now and and Moses said unto the people fear not for it is God that has come to prove you that his fear may be among you or uh before your faces that ye sin not and the people stood afar off and Moses Drew near into the thick Cloud where God was now so here you've got here you've got after the church ages after the church ages it's the same story there's the Lightnings there's the thunderings and then there's the voices in the Judgment of the Old Testament it was lightning thunderings voice of God told Moses or the people told Moses we can't hear from God anymore we don't want we we don't we're going to die if we see this every time he comes to visit us give us a prophet so then God in a couple more chapters says all right I'll give him a prophet I will only speak through a mortal man so here now I want us to to to understand that that brother now brother Branham is saying he says it's not one voice but its voice says plural what was it God speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God and to reject it is to remove the Candlestick see voices the son of the voice of the seven Church ages over here in the corner the voice is speaking with thunder and lightning nowadays they'll they'll say well we don't believe in saying Hell in the Pulpit oh mercy see we need men of God men who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you've got a voice somebody say I've got a voice you can't preach the people a sermon now if you're a preacher you're called to preach in the Pulpit if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived it's the voice of God that'll bring reproach to them who reject it they'll say no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet they're living if there's if there ever was a man of God it's that man or that woman live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to preach you'll get it all mixed up anyhow and you'll get people tangled up he says you'll ruin them and yourself too and you just just live your sermon he says the preachers called to preach and to live his too and if you can't live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to be it to live your sermons he says all right so here was the voices and all how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness and Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy he says the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or that but what hurts the devil is to see that Sanctified life holy life concentrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil can you say Amen so now what is in God's mouth his word and yet his word is spoke not through the perfect Son of God but now his word is being proclaimed through multitudes Hallelujah that doesn't mean that multitudes are doing the preaching it's the it's that God has sent the seven Messengers God has given us fivefold Ministry and then the church takes that word and believes it now there is a there there is a a great a great you know move today trying to take the voice of the minister away and and I I must say that it that should not be and it's and it's in the message where where there they just uh doing everything they can they say that every Pulpit should be surrendered to brother Branham and that we should be playing tapes that's not the way that that it was said in the scripture and it's not the way the brother random taught it Amen brother Branham said take this they asked for the random 65. should we quit preaching uh and he says no no he says when it in the big scheme of things I'm just a little Pebble on the beach we've all got a work that we've got to do and then he says you're going to be held responsible we are all going to be held responsible for this message that we're given can you say Amen now here's here's here's the deal I'm not going to keep you too much longer here tonight but my deal is this just as Jesus said I do nothing except the father show me did not brother Branham says the bride will have the have thus saith the Lord for she will keep still did not brother Branham teach us that there is a Razor's Edge difference between right and wrong are y'all hearing me the voice is in you the prophet's not here you're the one that is letting that word have preeminence in you how are you going to judge the world by the message you have accepted in your day Hallelujah I want it and I want to say friends there's going to be people even in our Even in our church here that that that you know we're going through the trials we're going this you know we we we the doctors reports and things like that but in our little group that we're sitting right here we're not worshiping a man we simply know that the scripture says that he would send us a messenger to this age and if we will heed the voice I'm not called to be a prophet so I can't be a prophet but what I can do as a pastor I can take the convictions with everything that I can see that God allows me to see of this message and I and and my my job is to point you to wipe that prophet's at because I'm not to take the price of the prophet and you're not to take the place of the preacher we all have a job and that's to live this word and that our voices declare it plainly pure lives clean lives undefiled lives are y'all hearing me so when when when we sit at judgment it's not that we're all going to sit around and take turns judging people it's the life that we lived in the age that we lived God lived his life through mortal beings and most people are treating you like they would treat Christ treat Jesus back two thousand years ago they don't see it but you do that's the reason I want to come back to this and visit this for a minute because in these Church ages it's important that you see who you are Hallelujah now listen if if we're if we're living loose if if you're if if you're if you're mouthing you know your husband and he's your leader and I don't care if you go back and apologize all the time or not after a day or two if you are allowing this to happen and you're not allowing your husband to lead you're not living this message if you're not if if you're if you're um you know allowing sin in your life and and then we we God's not called us to write the altar God's call us into Joseph Perfection remember remember the form foundations that this Great Masterpiece is built upon right what's the first Foundation election y'all y'all remember it Abraham Isaac Jacob and then Joseph so the first one was election brother Branham what did he say Isaac was love what did he say the that Jacob was Grace what did he say that Joseph was perfection he says here they go and brother Bradham says now the problem is when God's ready to build his masterpiece he says then we go from Joseph Perfection and come back down to Jacob Grace and he said then we'll just get everything all mixed back up again see but God's looking for someone God's looking for someone that he can build a masterpiece out of and I believe he's building that right here we must take this message serious in our lives and overcome how many Overcomers are in the building amen now we've got to so so brother brother Brandon would say what is in the mouth of the Lord it's the word that's in his mouth he says Matthew 4 and 4 it says uh but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God the word is supposed to be in our mouths too now we know the church is his body it is here to taking his place what will be in the mouth of the church the word so everything we believe now you say brother word word word word word word word word that's all we hear word word what are you talking about word you young people need to be looking in the Bible for the word concerning you how you're to treat mamas how you're to treat Dad how you're to treat and how you're to live flea fornication that is word for you you are you are submitting yourself to your parents who are you who is your Authority you understand that so you're sick you are submitting yourself to that word now I'm I'm not in that category I like to think I'm young but I'm feeling pretty old these days amen so but I've got a word concerning me and I am Duty bound to take what the prophet said about me and what the word said about me and there's a lot in there concerning the man can you say Amen now and you women the same way there's a lot of scripture concerning you women and you've got to stay in your place your position every one of us the preacher we've got to find our place in the word and when we do this and we're taking this seriously we're heeding to the message of Malachi 4. actually we're preaching a gospel that this world needs to hear we're preaching something that is to hear can you say Amen the the Apostle Peter says if any man speak Let It Be of the Oracles of God we believe what the word says is that right so so brother brother Branham I ask he says what is wrong with these people of the last day he says they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it Hallelujah so he's asking he's asking he says and and this is all part of that quote where he's talking about God is going to spew them out of his out of his mouth and he's and he said the reason why he's spewing the church it's not the individual he's got he's got an elect but he says the elect who has the spirit of his mouth will have that will live that word like the the the uh a like God said it at the beginning those who have the of God will live the word now he says the problem with the age is there's a lot of learning and no one's fervent there's no life so I think we need to pray Lord let that be in me is that right now what was Malachi 4 to do turn our hearts turn our love turn our our passions turn the passions back to the apostolic fathers that's his that's that's the whole goal are you hearing me so so this this word amen that that that came out of the the mouth of God the reason that I can speak the words of God is because the Breath of God has energized me energize me I'm not lukewarm about it I'm not cold about it I have got it in my mouth or in my heart so brother Brown says there it is he is sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending him Prophet after almost 2 000 years he is sending someone that who is so far from organization and education and the world of religion that uh John the Baptist that that is John the Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear only from God he will have thus saith the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece to this age now he And he as it is declared in Malachi 4 and 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring that elect back of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works Hallelujah do you see it amen praise the Lord Breathe on Me Lord Breathe on Me not a learning but Breathe on Me Oh when these men and I I tell you what it is not just a one-time deal we need the Holy Spirit to breathe his breath upon us and renew us and can you see man amen now now he's done it the same way he says now a momentary uh consideration of the church history will prove how accurate that thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost lost entirely lost to the people but Luther but God sent Luther with that word lutherans spoke for God at that time they organized and the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and Creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word and the people who took his Revelation from God became that living epistle read a known of all men for their generation when the method has failed God raised up others until it's gone through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age that tells me brother if the Holy Spirit has breathed if the logos has breathed upon me I don't have to look out out outside of this message to find Healing to find the answers for for for for for my uh for for our marriage for our church for our children for anything else the Breath of God is with this elect listen I wanted I I you know I wanted to I I wanted to come back and talk about that mouth one more time because I I to me it's it's so beautiful God oh it's not it's not quoting quoting's fine but there's a lot of people that can quote and can't live it so we want the Holy Spirit to quote by life quote by life right I don't want to say God's A Healer and then we never see him as a Healer I want him to quote healing through me through my life I want I want him to to speak Deliverance through me through my life amen that's that's that's what God's looking for is that right oh church this ain't this ain't just a religious setting it's not we we you know we're we're not we're not Muslims Muslims have good good good ethics and things and all kinds of denominations have good ethics but there is a people who under their messenger has become the final voice now catch that every one of the Seven Ages have had a voice and there's people that had the Breath of God they live what the messengers were saying and the prophet is saying God in this last day has got him a final group amen and I could go through a lot of quotes here where he was saying and the power of Pentecost will be in her praise the Lord amen he says the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelations verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear directly from God as that Pentecost that of course the word bride will be repudiated as it was at the first can you say Amen do you understand what I'm saying Oh The Living Voices amen all right anybody what anyone have any anything they want to add to that amen yes amen ities amen committed unto us the ministry of reconciliation so the Apostle Paul says so I pray you in Christ that be ye reconciled isn't that isn't that powerful that's powerful amen hallelujah anyone else praise the Lord any any questions I I this was pretty simple tonight amen you kids understanding amen Haven's saying listen I'm just still law I'm my I'm I'm I'm still all cloudy from the guitar playing tonight with these guys amen laughs I told y'all f is going to be in every song amen all right um I could hear them too well they were sounding good I'm really proud anyone else since Christine it's good to see you amen praise the Lord good it's good to see sister Sharon too sister Sharon hasn't been feeling well and and so we're glad to see you tonight sister Sharon amen we sure love sister Sharon praise the Lord now remember the lukewarm the lukewarm Church was also going to come out of his mouth Hallelujah so there's judgment to the lukewarm Church praise the Lord stay on fire Nathan brother Branham says oh would to God the church were cold or hot best of all she should be fervent hot but she is not the sentence has been passed she has no longer God's voice to the world she will maintain that she is but God says not oh God but he says oh but God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride this voice is in the bride Hallelujah oh it's the final voice if the musicians would come the final voice to the final age amen bless the Lord now so um really taking it and taking it seriously praying Lord Breathe on Me breathe once again on me renew me Lord I want to I I really really really really I don't want to just have good works [Music] I don't want to have just good works but I want to have the life of God in me Works can be learned Works can be taught but God's we're thankful for teaching [Music] but I teaching will never take the place of good Holy Spirit revelation amen [Music] and that just comes to that quiet time with the Lord and saying Lord I need more of you I need more of you and I guess that's my desire for the church amen what are you singing there Kobe foreign we are the generation we're the consummation the final voice [Music] the revelation truth will go oh yeah Generations [Music] [Applause] [Music] Temptation the truth will go to every time [Applause] foreign [Music] friends overcome sins to take the truth was [Applause] we are the chores and generation now I want you to think about it again think of the importance of what of what the stock that God's putting on Redemption in the Old Testament when they seen God when they seen him coming in the lightning and the thundering and a voice God has put so much stock in what he purchased at Calvary and in this church that when John seen him in in Revelations 4 it was the same lightning same thunderings and many voices [Music] God's put you God has God has put so much stock on Redemption God has put so much stock are you are you catching that when brother Brandon brought that out he he's he's trying to show the glory that God sees in this church singular Old Testament plural in the Book of Revelation Earl voices voices of judgment God will judge the world by the redeemed how was that brother Wendell because there's going to be maybe a young girl that that is that has fought fought and fought and most young girls Satan would already have them pulled out but you're standing there on that word and you're standing strong and though you don't feel like you're strong and though you don't feel and yet the holy spirit's living that life in you you will be that one that stands you'll be a voice maybe maybe it's a maybe it's a you know a single mama and and and and and you've got the Satan's you know giving you all kinds of opportunities and yet you've stood the test and God's God's told Satan I've raised her up I've raised her up to declare my glory through her that'll be a voice it may be a young man the the peer pressure so much peer pressure going on [Music] God's Got Confidence in his people God had confidence in job God's got confidence in you you say I I you know as I prayed Sunday you know feel like your mind's about to about to explode the pressure and yet you're seeking his will you're waiting on him you don't want to jump out of his wheel you're doing everything you can that's a voice that'll be a voice of judgment [Music] do you see it God is putting so much stock in you that he's he's you he's he's he's got everyone even in this little church right here he's got you hit in so many different directions maybe you're not getting hit the same as this other one and this one's not hidden but we're getting all hit in the same and yet we're all standing regardless you're not you're not fighting the same battle I'm fighting I'm not fighting the same battle Kobe's fighting Kobe's not fighting the same battle that that uh uh Jonah Jonas whatever your name is is fighting and John is not fighting the same battle that Mary's fighting but we're standing [Music] on that day there'll be Thunders and lightnings and voices live this message [Music] don't you give up don't you turn around don't you get lukewarm and if you are lukewarm with this word In The Name Of The Lord get a hold of God and say God breathe on me once again breathe on me I've got to have life stand when we all stand there we'll all come from our own unique situations but we're going to stand as Overcomers [Music] we're standing as Overcomers even now amen I want to be fervent that may be fervent let me be fervent with the word concerning me he loves me he's placed me is that what you're saying he so loved me that he placed me
