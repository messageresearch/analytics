[36:10] uh just I was going to go a different
[36:12] route and then and I just felt the Lord
[36:13] lead me just turn me around this way and
[36:16] uh I thank I thank the Lord for his
[36:20] Mercy one scripture 127 and verse
[36:25] one I sure like seeing all these Bibles

[36:34] Soloman except the Lord build the house
[36:37] they labor in vain that build it except
[36:39] the Lord keep the city The
[36:41] Watchmen waketh but in vain let's
[36:46] pray Heavenly Father we come to you this
[36:49] evening Lord and we want to say we love

[36:55] during this service father I ask you to
[36:56] speak to Hearts lead us guide us Lord
[36:59] Lord help me to fill your spirit in
[37:01] every part of the service Lord to fill
[37:03] your people Lord Lord God if you need to
[37:05] pull me to a certain different direction
[37:06] Lord that's the way I want to go Lord
[37:08] I'm a yielded vessel for you tonight be
[37:10] with us in Jesus name amen God bless you
[37:13] uh let you be seated I want to speak to
[37:16] you on a a thought tonight of herking
[37:18] diligent herking diligently unto the
[37:20] voice herken diligently unto the voice I
[37:23] think it's so important that we follow
[37:25] the voice of the Lord Lord the Lord is
[37:27] so mindful of us and you know there's a
[37:29] lot of people that walked with the
[37:31] prophet but that doesn't mean they were
[37:32] hearkening to the voice you know you
[37:33] could be best friends to to the preacher
[37:35] that don't mean you're hearkening to the
[37:36] voice but brother and sister when you
[37:38] are following the voice it is a it's a
[37:41] voice within the voice it's something
[37:42] inside that word and it will lead us
[37:45] into a Rapture one day you know I love
[37:47] about nature if you look at nature I
[37:49] love how you drive down the trees and
[37:50] it'll be just like normal no other
[37:52] change but all of a sudden one morning
[37:54] there'll be dog Woods bloomed all of a
[37:56] sudden and what is it it's a voice that
[37:58] spoke to them at a specific time and it
[38:00] said now is your time to bloom I believe
[38:03] the body chains will be exactly like
[38:05] that you know I love the Simplicity of
[38:07] it of an apple tree every Apple that
[38:09] will ever be produced in that tree is in
[38:11] the first seed you put that seed inside
[38:13] the ground every Apple that will ever be
[38:16] produced is already there it's got the
[38:18] potential and brother and sister we've
[38:20] got the seat of God we've got the word
[38:22] in our hearts and every promise of the
[38:24] book is already inside of the
[38:27] transforming power is already inside of
[38:29] us we just have to put it in the right
[38:31] atmosphere and at the right time God
[38:33] will cause it to do what it's supposed
[38:35] to do amen man has constantly been
[38:38] trying to increase in knowledge over the
[38:40] years and as we were saying well go
[38:42] except God keep the house we labor in
[38:44] vain we need God to keep us we need God
[38:47] to cause us to grow because you know we
[38:49] can do all the Motions it takes God to
[38:51] give the growth a farmer can do all the
[38:53] work that he needs to do in the field he
[38:55] can till the ground he can move the the
[38:56] Rocks he can move the sticks he can
[38:58] plant the seed it takes God to give the
[39:01] increase the water can come down it
[39:03] takes God to give the increase and we
[39:05] must have increase in our life brother
[39:07] and sister on an individual level we
[39:09] don't care we don't care what other
[39:11] people think about how spiritual we are
[39:13] the real you the real the real I the
[39:16] real us when we look into the mirror the
[39:18] one that we know when we go home and the
[39:20] doors shut whenever it's just us that's
[39:22] the real us and that's the guy I'm
[39:24] talking about it needs increase we need
[39:26] to grow in the Lord as we were saying
[39:29] man is constantly increasing in
[39:30] knowledge over the years they've
[39:32] increased in knowledge in astronomy
[39:34] architecture farming military medical
[39:36] and the list goes on they have increased
[39:38] in knowledge men have learned how to
[39:40] hand down Knowledge from one generation
[39:43] down to the other of how to make the
[39:44] business better and they've learned the
[39:46] necessity of sacrifice and security and
[39:48] those are very important sacrifice and
[39:51] and security are important and utilizing
[39:54] business models man has successfully
[39:56] built large businesses in the world and
[39:58] man has tried to apply those same
[40:01] practices to the church they've tried to
[40:03] do these things of saying you know what
[40:04] we'll run this church just like the
[40:06] business because you know what Walmart
[40:08] has grown it's a super mega store
[40:11] they've got churches that are super mega
[40:13] churches they get a lot of fruit going
[40:15] at where a lot of people come to church
[40:17] but let me ask you where is the life at
[40:20] where is the new birth set so we can't
[40:22] just go by using the model of knowledge
[40:25] but it takes rapturing faith it takes a
[40:28] spirit of a voice within a voice
[40:30] speaking to the people what is it it's a
[40:33] deep call to the Deep God will put a
[40:35] hunger in a people's heart God will have
[40:37] a word that will speak to that hunger
[40:40] and that's why we have a message of the
[40:42] hour that's why we cannot be satisfied
[40:45] with denominational teaching
[40:46] denominational word what is it there's
[40:48] something inside you it's a seed that
[40:51] needs the light of this hour to bring a
[40:53] full Harvest because a Luther's message
[40:56] will not bring that seed to a full
[40:58] Harvest Wesley's message will not bring
[41:01] it to a full Harvest we need a message
[41:03] of the hour today where we are in that
[41:06] presence where it is drawing out the
[41:08] Apple so to speak it's drawing out the
[41:11] Divine promises because it'll be what
[41:13] gives us the Rapture in Isaiah 55: 6- 11
[41:16] it says seek ye the Lord while he may be
[41:18] found call ye upon him while he's near
[41:20] let let the wicked forsake his way and
[41:22] the unrighteous man his thoughts let him
[41:25] return unto the Lord and have mercy upon
[41:27] uh him and our God he will abundantly
[41:30] pardon for our thoughts are not for my
[41:33] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[41:35] are your ways my ways sayith the Lord
[41:37] for as the heavens are higher than the
[41:38] earth so are my ways higher than your
[41:40] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[41:43] for as the rain cometh down in the snow
[41:45] from Heaven returneth not thither but
[41:47] WTH the Earth and maketh to bring forth
[41:49] in Bud that it may give seed to the swer
[41:52] and bread to the eater so shall my word
[41:55] be that goeth forth for out of my mouth
[41:57] it shall not return into me void but it
[42:00] shall accomplish that which I please and
[42:02] it shall prosper into the thing where
[42:04] unto I sent it God sent a word and it
[42:07] will accomplish what it's sent to
[42:09] accomplish how many knows there's a word
[42:11] for
[42:12] healing that word will not come back
[42:14] void and you when you take the Divine
[42:17] promise of healing by the spoken word
[42:19] and you go with the same attitude
[42:22] towards that word the same Faith toward
[42:24] that word God will give you the same
[42:25] result
[42:26] and God's got a word all the way down
[42:28] the ages for a Rapture and our our
[42:31] hearts in my heart brother and sister
[42:33] it's a pull for a Rapture and I don't
[42:36] believe the church will just stumble
[42:37] through and all of a sudden they're
[42:39] going to get a Rapture I believe they
[42:41] will be looking for it there's something
[42:43] inside the heart that is looking for a
[42:46] Rapture amen God is in is precise in all
[42:49] that he does and he doesn't do anything
[42:51] aimlessly and he doesn't have any spare
[42:53] parts God doesn't have any pot pieces to
[42:56] the puzzle for no reason let me say this
[42:58] to you each person in here you were
[43:00] designedly created for a specific person
[43:03] purpose God has got a specific purpose
[43:06] for each person here I want to know my
[43:09] purpose in this life I want to know what
[43:11] it is I want to know where I'm at
[43:13] because you know if you're going
[43:14] somewhere you have to have a map you
[43:15] have to know where you're going you have
[43:17] to know where you're at now what do I
[43:19] need to do to get here that's why God
[43:21] gave us a message that we can look and
[43:24] see where we're at inside this thing a
[43:26] watch has all these pieces in the puzzle
[43:28] but each each piece of the of the of the
[43:31] watch has a job each one has a position
[43:34] and when they will work in their
[43:35] position not anybody else's in their
[43:38] position everything works in harmony I
[43:40] love that how God has a provided way for
[43:44] every person there is a place in the
[43:46] body for each person here tonight you
[43:49] have a a seat that is reserved for you
[43:51] that's your seat but you know Satan will
[43:54] try to take that away and say you're
[43:55] just here
[43:57] I hate to use an example of a movie or a
[43:59] story but it's the best way I know how
[44:00] to get the example in a movie you've got
[44:03] somebody going down the world that
[44:04] nobody knows about somebody stands at
[44:06] the gas station nobody's about nobody
[44:08] knows about because the emphasis of a
[44:10] story is about a certain person but
[44:12] there are certain people now nobody
[44:13] knows who they are they're just people
[44:15] that fill the pages there are people
[44:17] that fills the screen you are not that
[44:20] person God has there's no party in here
[44:23] that's just somebody that's filling the
[44:25] pages you are important you've got a
[44:28] call in your life God's got something
[44:30] inside your heart God has a purpose in
[44:33] your life God wants to speak to your
[44:35] heart and we must hearken to the voice
[44:38] diligently we must listen to The Voice
[44:41] on a daad basis God what is my shepherd
[44:44] trying to tell me today what is my
[44:46] shepherd trying to lead me to do because
[44:48] I believe that we can be led by the
[44:50] spirit where God can speak to your heart
[44:53] God will land on your heart where you
[44:55] will speak to
[44:56] somebody you can be the encouragement to
[44:59] somebody brother BR up he could give a
[45:01] testimony you know Everyone likes to
[45:03] have the minister do the praying you
[45:04] ever noticed
[45:07] that I want the minister to pray brother
[45:10] Bram talked about a time where he was at
[45:12] a service and there was a sister that
[45:14] was watching this this woman with a baby
[45:16] going to the prayer
[45:17] line and the Lord laid it on her heart
[45:20] said you pray for that baby and she said
[45:23] you know what I'm just a I'm just a
[45:24] woman she's fixing to go before aay
[45:26] prophet of God who am I to pray for this
[45:27] baby I I'm not going to pray for this
[45:28] baby the Lord spoke to her again pray
[45:30] for that
[45:31] baby and the woman gets out of her seat
[45:34] and walks over to her imagine how she
[45:35] must feel this man's G to go for this
[45:38] before the prophet of God to pray for
[45:39] and she says I know you're going before
[45:41] this Prophet to be prayed for and I
[45:43] understand that sister she said but the
[45:45] lord has laid it on my heart to pray for

[45:52] baby and this mama this mama lays her
[45:55] hands on this baby and pray Lord Jesus
[45:57] and I don't know what prayer I'm sure it
[45:58] was a real simple Mama's Prayer there's
[46:00] nothing like a Mama's Prayer a mama can
[46:04] break through barriers like
[46:06] nobody a mama has an ability to break
[46:10] through where nobody else can break
[46:11] through prayed for this baby and this
[46:14] woman she loses her seat and she has to
[46:15] go sit way up on a balcony this woman
[46:18] eventually goes to the prayer line and
[46:19] the prophet grabs a HUD over and starts
[46:20] to pray for the baby she said Lord
[46:22] father I ask you this woman this Baby's
[46:24] already healed amen this little woman

[48:12] Eternal there's so many people put all
[48:14] their trust all their focus on the
[48:16] treasures of this world that will pass
[48:19] away but brother and sister there's one
[48:21] soul that is worth 10 million Worlds the
[48:24] prophet talked to about hell he went to
[48:26] go get a sandwich one time and he
[48:28] couldn't get the sandwich cuz they were
[48:29] clothes he went across the street and he
[48:31] walked inside here and there was a
[48:32] little jukebox playing he said he saw
[48:35] this little woman with no clothes on and
[48:37] he said I thought a critical thought
[48:38] about this woman I thought look at this
[48:40] old woman the way she's dressed look at
[48:43] the way she's doing Lord you just wipe
[48:44] her off the earth and the Lord open a
[48:47] vision to him said you stand you walk
[48:49] over here for a minute I got something
[48:50] to talk to you about and the Lord showed
[48:52] the prophet how this this world was big
[48:55] this big big world with blood all the
[48:57] way around this world and he said I saw
[48:59] his Sins Not the woman's sins the
[49:02] prophet sins that were going toward the
[49:05] lord and there was a bumper that kept
[49:06] bumping that sin every single time I'm
[49:09] mind I think of it a prophet of God
[49:13] allowed himself to fall to a place where
[49:15] he was criticizing a woman and the Lord
[49:17] said let me talk to you about this a
[49:19] minute yeah what about you and me
[49:21] brother and sister you know what we have
[49:24] an opportunity we can criticize about oh
[49:26] we can say there's Mercy for you cuz the
[49:29] prophet needed Mercy I thank God for
[49:32] that that gives me Pro that gives me
[49:35] confidence I got confidence in a
[49:37] leadership that will say I'm wrong
[49:39] forgive me and get back in line and say
[49:43] this is how you do it mommy and daddy
[49:45] that's the best thing you can ever do is
[49:47] let your children say let just let them
[49:48] see you say I'm sorry and make it right
[49:52] amen praise the
[49:54] Lord
[49:57] sometimes I feel like my kids have had
[49:58] to se that's all dad says is I'm
[50:00] sorry we've had we've had a very blessed
[50:03] life the Lord's been very good to
[50:05] me but I believe that we we are the
[50:07] display of Mercy
[50:09] amen Our Lives should be surrounded by
[50:12] this word the word is what take makes
[50:14] everything go into balance into our life
[50:16] the word is not like a dead weight into
[50:18] our life but the word will actually
[50:19] orchestrate you and how many needs the
[50:21] blessings of the Lord in your life it's
[50:23] a Divine promise I'm going to show you
[50:24] let's go to Deuteronomy 28 this is just
[50:26] a few scriptures but I want to I want to
[50:27] read it Deuteronomy 28:
[50:30] 1-15 it says and it will come to pass if
[50:33] Thou shalt hearken diligently unto the
[50:35] voice of the Lord thy God to observe and
[50:37] do all his Commandments which I command
[50:39] thee this day that the Lord thy God will
[50:41] set thee on a high above all nations of
[50:43] the earth and all these blessings shall
[50:46] come on thee and overtake thee think of
[50:48] that overtake thee you can be overtaken
[50:50] by the blessing of the Lord when I think
[50:53] of that I'm thinking about going through
[50:54] and you have a flesh flood you ever seen
[50:56] a flesh flood yes sir I've always saw
[50:58] that and I imagine my mind it was water
[50:59] about this deep it's not that's not a
[51:00] flesh flood flesh flood can wipe out
[51:03] houses and wipe out cars wipe out
[51:05] everything we're talking about a
[51:06] blessing of the Lord that can overtake
[51:08] you that's right the blessing of the
[51:10] Lord and how do you get it by hearkening
[51:12] diligently to the voice that's Old
[51:15] Testament but it's still truth amen he
[51:18] says and these blessings shall come on
[51:21] thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt
[51:23] hearken into the voice of the Lord thy
[51:25] God blessed shall thou be in the city
[51:27] blessed shall thou be in the field
[51:29] blessed shall be the fruit of thy body
[51:31] and the fruit of the ground the fruit of
[51:33] the cattle the increase of thy kind the
[51:35] flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be the
[51:37] baskets in thy store blessed shall thou
[51:40] be when thou comest in and blessed shall
[51:43] thou be when thou goest out the Lord
[51:45] shall cause thine enemies that rise up
[51:47] against thee to be smitten before thy
[51:49] face they shall come out against thee
[51:52] one way and flee before the seven ways
[51:55] the Lord shall command the blessing
[51:57] think of it the Lord shall command a
[52:00] blessing on you I want the blessing I
[52:04] want the blessing of his holy spirit I
[52:06] want the blessings of the promises if he
[52:08] says I can have it I want the blessing
[52:11] and I want to be overtaken by it
[52:14] amen the Lord shall establish Thee the
[52:17] holy people unto himself as he has sworn
[52:19] unto thee if Thou shalt keep the
[52:21] Commandments of the Lord thy God and
[52:22] walk in his ways and all the people of
[52:25] the Earth shall see that thou art called
[52:27] by the name of the Lord and they shall
[52:29] be afraid of thee think of it brother
[52:31] and sister the Devils around you can be
[52:33] afraid of you why because they hear the
[52:36] testimonies this is a son and daughter
[52:39] of God that every time we throw
[52:41] something at him he overcomes it no
[52:43] matter what I throw at him he overcomes
[52:45] it why because you are hening diligently
[52:49] unto the Lord he's naming everything
[52:51] that you will fight in this life in the
[52:53] scripture the Lord show open up his good
[52:56] treasure the heaven to give the rain

[54:06] longer get into your medical records the
[54:08] 16year old has has to give them

[54:20] out of
[54:22] it we live in an age where they defy
[54:26] authority what is it it's a spirit that
[54:29] will come on them and brother and sister
[54:31] we need leadership we must from our
[54:34] souls not from our minds not with our
[54:36] mouths I'm talking from our hearts say
[54:39] God I need leadership well God if you

[1:03:43] followed him David was a giant killer
[1:03:45] can you say Amen David killed Giants for
[1:03:48] a living and he didn't get paid for it
[1:03:50] he just did it because he liked to do it
[1:03:52] there was a spirit inside him that could
[1:03:54] kill Giants but you know his men did the
[1:03:56] same thing the men that followed David
[1:03:59] would go in if you look at the
[1:04:00] scriptures they went in there and fought
[1:04:02] men that had face of a lion when's the
[1:04:05] last time somebody fought the man with a
[1:04:06] face with a lion these guys think
[1:04:08] they're tough imagine that being on the
[1:04:09] football field they're talking about
[1:04:12] intimidating could you imagine going
[1:04:14] into the rocks and fighting a man with
[1:04:17] the face of a lion but what is it God's
[1:04:19] got Believers today that do that it's
[1:04:22] called the ministry brother and sister
[1:04:25] it's the ministry with one over here one
[1:04:28] over here one over here and they'll go

[1:04:36] devil you know that's what we need we
[1:04:38] need some more Davids and Men of David
[1:04:41] that will stand up to the devil he said

[1:04:44] church you're not going to Prevail over
[1:04:46] this family we are children of the
[1:04:48] Living God we have the spirit of God and
[1:04:51] we don't have to put up with this this
[1:04:54] something inside me that stirs when I
[1:04:56] see somebody living under their
[1:04:58] privileges brother and sister your
[1:05:01] pastor is a David the ministry here are
[1:05:05] men of David and listen to me we don't
[1:05:09] we want to say you know what you got
[1:05:10] this you go fight that devil you say
[1:05:14] Amen because you know what you're going
[1:05:16] to have to fight that devil
[1:05:18] too you're going to be the Giant Killer
[1:05:21] but you know what the first time you
[1:05:23] ever killed a giant everybody had to do
[1:05:25] it for the first
[1:05:27] time everybody listen to me young people
[1:05:30] everybody had to overcome a giant the
[1:05:33] first
[1:05:35] time brother Josh when I were out on
[1:05:38] playing his basketball court and I was
[1:05:39] telling him about you know I was looking
[1:05:41] at their shots and I saw this brother
[1:05:42] Joe and he had just the absolute perfect
[1:05:44] shot flipping down I said see that's a
[1:05:47] perfect shot right there brother Joshua
[1:05:50] threw his up I said that's okay that's
[1:05:52] kind of okay shot you know
[1:05:55] no they gave the ball to me the go was
[1:05:59] here the ball went over
[1:06:03] there I said I could tell you what it is
[1:06:05] but sometimes I can't do
[1:06:07] it in the natural brother sister we can
[1:06:10] get by that but in the ministry brother
[1:06:13] and sister we can't do that when we say
[1:06:15] you can do this the ministry has got to
[1:06:17] say this is how you do it can you say
[1:06:20] Amen because you can't have confidence
[1:06:22] there my my uh
[1:06:26] reputation of a basketball player
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:31] went they no longer want to hear what I
[1:06:33] had to say about shooting a basketball
[1:06:35] and I wasn't trying to make thus sayith
[1:06:36] the Lord of basketball but you
[1:06:38] understand what I'm saying brethen
[1:06:40] sister there's things in this life
[1:06:41] that's why it's so important catch this
[1:06:43] now that's why it's so important by the
[1:06:46] idol things that we speak in this life
[1:06:47] brother and sister catch this now the
[1:06:50] idol things that we speak about in this
[1:06:52] life that is why it's so careful that we
[1:06:54] are hening to the voice of the Lord
[1:06:56] because if you start talking a bunch of
[1:06:58] nonsense people around you will lose
[1:07:00] confidence in you they won't care about
[1:07:02] how much you know because they're
[1:07:03] listening listen to me we need to be led
[1:07:05] by the spirit we need to hearken to the
[1:07:08] voice Jesus said on man will speak from
[1:07:11] the abundance of his heart I love when I
[1:07:13] get around somebody and listen to them
[1:07:14] talk because I can tell they've been
[1:07:16] talking they've been thinking on the
[1:07:17] Lord I can tell I want the first thing
[1:07:19] when someone says something what kind of
[1:07:20] man is brother Miguel that man's a
[1:07:22] Christian

[1:07:27] Christian what kind of a what kind of
[1:07:29] business is that that's a Christian
[1:07:31] business you want that to be number
[1:07:36] one this is a test I'm not trying to
[1:07:38] lift myself up this is the honest
[1:07:40] truth how many knows I used to sell
[1:07:43] cars yeah I
[1:07:45] did and I felt the Lord tell me to walk
[1:07:48] away from it not because I was doing
[1:07:49] anything wrong but I believe God has
[1:07:51] given me a gift to preach this gospel
[1:07:52] and I don't want to use that gift for
[1:07:54] anything else I just want to Sacred
[1:07:56] completely 100% before the Lord and I've

[1:09:53] door open the door if God open the door
[1:09:55] I will go minister to them listen to me
[1:09:58] this is I'm challenging you tonight you
[1:10:00] want this kind of testimony to where
[1:10:02] your life where somebody can look at you
[1:10:04] say I know a real Christian let me take
[1:10:06] you to one they may not know all about
[1:10:08] the Bible they may not know about this
[1:10:09] but they know the author listen to me
[1:10:12] it's it's more important listen to me
[1:10:14] young people it's more important to know
[1:10:16] the author than to know quotes there's a
[1:10:18] lot of people in this world today they
[1:10:19] know a lot of quotes but they don't know
[1:10:21] the author and you can tell by talking
[1:10:22] to them listen to me there's a spirit
[1:10:25] inside them you can talk to a Christian
[1:10:26] just for a few minutes and you can feel
[1:10:28] that you can be in a Christian a
[1:10:29] person's home and you can tell in just a
[1:10:31] few minutes if that's a Christian what
[1:10:33] is it they are hearkening to the
[1:10:36] voice brother and sister because we can
[1:10:38] anybody can jump and Shout during
[1:10:39] service anybody can do that that's
[1:10:41] nothing but can you do it during the

[1:15:13] would not be miraculous if I had 800
[1:15:15] cars and everything going good that's
[1:15:16] not good it would not be miraculous if
[1:15:18] Samson was 7 foot tall and full of
[1:15:20] muscles what made it miraculous is he
[1:15:21] was a little bitty boy
[1:15:23] and the spirit of the Lord come up on
[1:15:25] him and then he conquered the gates
[1:15:27] that's what made it miraculous brother
[1:15:28] and sister it wouldn't be miraculous if
[1:15:30] Moses would have delivered the children
[1:15:32] of Israel at the peak of his strength
[1:15:34] and all of his knowledge and all of his
[1:15:35] wisdom that wouldn't be miraculous what
[1:15:37] made it miraculous is he was an
[1:15:38] 80-year-old beat down man that with
[1:15:41] flabby arms he didn't have anything to
[1:15:42] offer at all except trusting in the Lord
[1:15:45] CU that's where his strength come from

[1:19:55] selling the trucks and the
[1:19:57] vehicles I was going down the
[1:20:00] road and I was talking about this
[1:20:02] vehicle and you know any good product
[1:20:05] will sell
[1:20:07] itself if you'll demonstrate it right
[1:20:10] but a lot of the reason people don't buy
[1:20:12] it if they think it's a bad product is
[1:20:13] because it was demonstrated
[1:20:15] wrong that's
[1:20:17] right people would demonstrate it wrong
[1:20:19] and people say there's nothing to that
[1:20:20] and that's what a lot of people have
[1:20:21] done with the gospel it's because
[1:20:22] they're demonstrating it wrong I was
[1:20:24] going down the road and I was talking
[1:20:25] about this vehicle all the options on
[1:20:28] that and this man was sitting to the
[1:20:30] right and the child behind me and I just
[1:20:33] felt the Lord move upon my heart that
[1:20:34] that Spirit just drop down into the
[1:20:37] truck and I had two
[1:20:40] choices I can either continue to sell
[1:20:42] this truck or I can help this brother or
[1:20:46] I can help this
[1:20:50] sister I Heard a Voice that dropped down
[1:20:52] in in the truck and it was an
[1:20:54] opportunity for me follow the spirit of
[1:20:56] God there's times when the spirit will
[1:20:59] drop in into your presence you may be
[1:21:01] washing dishes you may be doing laundry
[1:21:03] you may be doing electrical work when
[1:21:06] that Spirit drops down catch this when
[1:21:08] that Spirit drops down it's for a
[1:21:11] purpose God's not just doing it
[1:21:13] aimlessly God is wanting to lead you to
[1:21:15] do something I felt this presence
[1:21:17] dropped
[1:21:18] down in this truck and I began to use
[1:21:21] that opportunity to talk to him about
[1:21:23] the Lord I said you know what I said God
[1:21:26] is such a good god ain't he and I felt
[1:21:28] that coldness about him I said you know
[1:21:31] what let me let me just give you a
[1:21:31] testimony about what God's done in my

[1:21:50] devalued I began to say you mind if I
[1:21:52] give you a testimony about how my fire
[1:21:55] got lit I began to talk to this man
[1:21:56] about how my fire got lit in the gospel
[1:21:59] and I felt that presence just from me
[1:22:00] again to drop down and I'm here to tell
[1:22:02] you I said God changed my life God
[1:22:04] turned me around god Set Me Free and
[1:22:06] this man who was cold began to cry

[2:06:57] lord we love when the Lord comes when
[2:07:01] the Lord shows his presence we we love
[2:07:04] when
[2:07:05] the sermons come together and knit
[2:07:09] together in a way that you never would
[2:07:11] have thought brother brother Daniel had
[2:07:13] no idea that the verse that he read to
[2:07:16] start Psalms
[2:07:17] 127:1 except the Lord build the house
[2:07:19] they labor in vain that build it except
[2:07:21] the Lord keep the city The Watchman
[2:07:24] waketh but in vain when I was studying
[2:07:27] for what I was to minister this morning
[2:07:29] I had looked at that verse multiple
[2:07:31] times and could never quite see how it
[2:07:33] fit into what I was supposed to be
[2:07:35] ministering on but yet there was
[2:07:37] something I kept going back to it kept
[2:07:39] going back to it and it ties into to
[2:07:42] what brother Wendell's been preaching
[2:07:44] over the weeks and then brother Daniel
[2:07:46] comes in and just brings it out in such
[2:07:48] a a wonderful way
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:55] and and then the Lord comes down
[2:07:58] and lets you know
[2:08:01] that he was ministering he was speaking
[2:08:04] that it was him inspiring it
[2:08:06] because he's the one that touches the
[2:08:09] heart it's not it's not a man it's not
[2:08:10] brother Daniel with having such an
[2:08:12] ability to to put the words together and
[2:08:15] to make it all work it's that
[2:08:17] inspiration coming behind and going
[2:08:20] hey you're my
[2:08:23] people hey you've
[2:08:25] been warned you've been spoken to you've
[2:08:28] been talked
[2:08:30] to and reminded again that hey this is
[2:08:32] for you to be doing the work this is for
[2:08:34] you to be taking the next step this
[2:08:36] would be for you to be claiming the
[2:08:38] promise this is for you to be doing the
[2:08:40] praying not just the Minister doing the
[2:08:42] praying not just the Watchman that's up
[2:08:45] there calling out that hey this is what
[2:08:46] needs to dress you have to be the one
[2:08:48] down there building the wall you have to
[2:08:50] be the one doing the praying you have to
[2:08:52] be the one doing
[2:08:54] it I think God's being very clear to
[2:08:57] each and one of
[2:08:59] us that we have our part to be
[2:09:02] doing that we have our part to be
[2:09:05] praying we have our part to be cleaning
[2:09:09] house and taking
[2:09:12] inventory because we have the spirit
[2:09:15] that keeps keeps calling out keeps
[2:09:18] pointing out keeps going look we're that
[2:09:20] close look it's just about time we're
[2:09:24] almost
[2:09:26] there it's almost
[2:09:30] time get
[2:09:32] serious get things handled get things
[2:09:37] addressed we see Satan moving like a
[2:09:39] roaring lion trying to hit with item
[2:09:42] after item thing after thing going
[2:09:45] after person after person with different
[2:09:48] different struggles with
[2:09:50] different problems with different
[2:09:54] spirits but the answer is still the same
[2:09:57] no matter what the problem is the answer
[2:09:59] is the same we turn back to Christ we
[2:10:02] turn back to applying the blood we turn
[2:10:04] back to applying the
[2:10:08] token the quote that I read at the very
[2:10:10] end of the sermon this
[2:10:11] morning then when we pray we must have
[2:10:14] the token to present with our prayers as
[2:10:18] I said and now believe for ourselves and
[2:10:20] apply the token to the whole family like
[2:10:23] in Egypt Jericho or either in Acts 16:31
[2:10:26] we find out that Paul told the Roman
[2:10:27] Centurion say believe thou and all thy
[2:10:30] house shall be saved apply it to your
[2:10:32] family if you've got unsaved child lay
[2:10:34] the token right on top of him say Lord
[2:10:37] God I claim him stay right there if
[2:10:38] you've got a mother or a loved one
[2:10:40] that's lost lay that token on them say
[2:10:42] Lord God I claim it move out all of the
[2:10:44] worldly trash out of your house get
[2:10:46] ready for it burn up your shorts throw
[2:10:49] out your card tables get rid of your
[2:10:50] cigarettes dump your unbelief and your
[2:10:53] church papers in the trash can where
[2:10:54] they belong then you're getting ready
[2:10:57] then what do you do then apply the token
[2:10:59] in prayer with real evidence real Faith
[2:11:02] apply it apply it with confidence when
[2:11:04] you apply the token know that you are
[2:11:06] cleaned up if our hearts condemn us not
[2:11:09] then we have our request when we're able
[2:11:12] to apply the token then we will see
[2:11:15] Miracles because there's nothing to
[2:11:17] block us there's nothing to hinder us if
[2:11:20] that token is there if all the trash is
[2:11:23] gone there's nothing between us and the
[2:11:27] promise let's sing that again brother we
[2:11:30] shall see
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:34] Miracles

[2:12:47] mirales
[2:12:51] praise the
[2:12:52] Lord I think we can
[2:12:55] all honestly say that the Lord was here
[2:12:57] tonight that the Lord met us and
[2:13:00] ministered to our hearts and I know that
[2:13:04] we're going to be hearing praise reports
[2:13:07] from those
[2:13:09] that brought their needs before the Lord
[2:13:12] those that came up to
[2:13:14] pray but one thing I want each of you to
[2:13:17] remember
[2:13:18] as I heard brother Daniel talking to
[2:13:20] each one of you is to remember to walk
[2:13:21] away
[2:13:23] proclaiming the
[2:13:25] promise no matter what the symptoms may
[2:13:28] look like no matter what the reports may
[2:13:30] look like no matter
[2:13:32] what the
[2:13:34] situation may be looking like around you
[2:13:38] you keep holding to the promise you keep
[2:13:40] holding to the word of God and claiming
[2:13:43] this is what it
[2:13:45] is whether I feel it this moment or or
[2:13:48] not I'm walking away healed whether I
[2:13:51] feel it right this moment or not I'm
[2:13:54] walking away
[2:13:56] free whether I feel it or not I'm
[2:13:59] walking away an
[2:14:02] overcomer you keep claiming the promise
[2:14:05] no matter what you feel like because the
[2:14:08] feelings will lie to
[2:14:11] you isn't it just good to be in the
[2:14:14] presence of the
[2:14:16] Lord it
[2:14:19] was definitely a blessing for me
[2:14:24] I and this is one you know it's even for
[2:14:27] me it's still a privilege to be invited
[2:14:29] up to be one of the ones praying I still
[2:14:32] consider that such a an honor and a
[2:14:34] different because I'm still not used to
[2:14:37] that but to feel the presence of the
[2:14:39] Lord when he comes down to feel him
[2:14:42] touching to be able to look around on
[2:14:43] the faces and see the Lord working in
[2:14:46] Hearts whether they came to the front or
[2:14:47] not not to know the Lord's still Mindful
