[47:06] sister Mary um said they've had a really
[47:10] been a wonderful meeting there in in
[47:13] Ohio and so um the group will be coming
[47:16] back here u heading back shortly I'm
[47:19] sure so we're just really glad to to to
[47:22] hear the wonderful results uh that have
[47:25] taken place there. Uh let's look here in
[47:27] the book of uh St. John's and then we'll
[47:29] let you have your seats. Let's look here
[47:31] at John 20. And um
[47:37] um
[47:40] it's going to be a lengthy passage here.
[47:42] So what I'm going to do is we'll just
[47:44] read the uh um
[47:48] the um four verses here and then we'll
[47:52] continue to read.
[47:54] It says, "The first day of the week
[47:57] cometh Mary Magdalene early
[48:00] when it was yet dark into the unto the
[48:03] sepre and seeing the stone taken away
[48:07] from the sepre. Then she runth and
[48:10] cometh to Simon Peter and to the other
[48:13] disciple whom Jesus loved and said unto
[48:17] them, they have taken away the Lord out
[48:21] of the sepre,
[48:22] and we know not where they have laid
[48:25] him. And Peter therefore went forth and
[48:29] that other disciple and came to the
[48:31] sepre. So they ran both together and the
[48:35] other disciple did outrun Peter and come
[48:39] first to the slicer.
[48:42] And let's just go and stop here. Let's
[48:44] pray and then we'll continue to read.
[48:46] Father, we just want to thank you today
[48:48] for your many blessings that you have
[48:51] given us. Thank you, Lord, for your
[48:53] presence that we know is here this
[48:56] morning. For where two or three are
[48:57] gathered together, you are in our midst,
[49:00] Lord. And so God, we just give ourselves
[49:03] to you. We come by faith, believing,
[49:06] Lord, that you know all about us. You
[49:10] know every need that is present. And
[49:13] Father, I'm asking that you would meet
[49:15] every need, Lord, in divine presence. I
[49:19] ask God that you would uh just be here
[49:22] in a very special way and speak to our
[49:24] hearts. Lord, we love you with all that
[49:28] is within us, Father. That's why we're
[49:30] here this morning as we want to grow in
[49:32] you and and to love you, Father. And
[49:35] now, Lord, we we thank you for all
[49:38] things in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[49:41] Can the church say, "Amen."
[49:44] And amen. God bless you. You may be
[49:46] seated here. And we're just going to
[49:49] continue to read on on down. And it
[49:52] says, "And he stooping down and looking
[49:54] in saw the linen clothes lying. Yet w he
[49:59] not in. Then cometh Simon Peter
[50:02] following him, and went into the
[50:04] sufficer, and seeth the linens linen
[50:08] clothes lie, and the napkin that was
[50:11] about his head, not lying with the linen
[50:13] clothes, but wrapped together in a place
[50:16] by itself.
[50:18] Then went in also that other disciple,
[50:21] which came first to the sepre, and he
[50:24] saw and believed. For as yet they knew
[50:28] not the scripture, that he must rise
[50:31] again from the dead. Then the disciples
[50:34] went away again unto their own home. And
[50:37] Mary stood without at the sepre weeping.
[50:40] And as she wept, she stooped down and
[50:43] looked unto the sepre, and sees two
[50:46] angels in white sitting, one at the
[50:49] head, and the other at the feet where
[50:51] the body of Jesus had lain. And they say
[50:55] unto the woman, Why weepest thou, And
[50:58] she saith unto them, Because they have
[51:01] taken away my Lord, and I know not where
[51:04] they have laid him. And she, when she
[51:08] had said thus, she turned herself back,
[51:10] and saw Jesus standing, and knew not
[51:13] that it was Jesus. And Jesus said unto
[51:17] her, "Woman, why weepest thou? Whom
[51:19] seekest thou?" And she supposing him to
[51:22] be the gardener, said unto him, Sir, if
[51:26] thou hast borne him hence, tell me where
[51:30] thou hast laid him, and I will take him
[51:32] away. And Jesus saith unto her, Mary.
[51:37] And she turned herself and says unto
[51:39] him, "Rabbi,"
[51:41] which is to say, "Master,"
[51:44] Jesus saith unto her, "Touch me not, for
[51:46] I am not yet ascended to my father, but
[51:49] go to my brethren, and say unto them, I
[51:51] ascend to my father and your father, to
[51:54] my God and your God." And Mary Magdalene
[51:57] came and told the disciples that she had
[51:59] seen the Lord, and that he had spoken
[52:02] these things unto her. And the same day
[52:05] at evening, being the first day of the
[52:07] week, when the doors were shut, where
[52:09] the disciples were assembled for fear of
[52:12] the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the
[52:15] midst, and said unto them, Peace be unto
[52:19] you. And when he had had so said, he
[52:24] showed unto them his hands and his side.
[52:27] And then were the disciples glad when
[52:29] they saw the Lord. And then Jesus said
[52:32] to them, "Peace be unto you, as my
[52:36] father hath sent me, even so send I
[52:40] you."
[52:42] When I when he had uh said this, he
[52:45] breathed on them and seth unto them,
[52:48] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whosoever
[52:52] sins you remit, they are remitted unto
[52:54] them. And whosoever sins you retain, you
[52:58] they are retained."
[53:00] So, I want to take a a passage of
[53:03] scripture. Amen. Or I want to take a
[53:06] thought out of this. The breath of life.
[53:09] Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Now, and I I
[53:13] want to uh the continuation
[53:18] of the life of God, the continuation of
[53:21] the ministry of Christ. Amen. This is
[53:25] what Christ is has just raised from the
[53:29] dead. He has paid for our salvation.
[53:32] He has now shown himself alive. And he
[53:36] is he is telling them, amen, peace be
[53:41] unto you, as my father hath sent me and
[53:45] I'm going back to my father. Amen. Now
[53:48] I'm going to send you. Amen. And then he
[53:52] breathes on them and says, "Receive ye
[53:56] the Holy Ghost." Now, we understand that
[53:58] this was not the receiving of the Holy
[54:01] Ghost, but this was a declaration that
[54:04] the Holy Ghost was yet to come. For he
[54:07] would tell them to go to Jerusalem and
[54:09] to wait there in there in Acts 1 and um
[54:14] and and one I I'm going to be doing a
[54:16] little bit of reading here for a little
[54:18] bit, but I I'm I'm hoping it'll all come
[54:20] together. It says, "The former treaties
[54:23] I write unto thee uh or I have made, oh
[54:26] theophilos, all that Jesus began both to
[54:29] do and teach until the day in which he
[54:32] was taken up after that through the Holy
[54:35] Ghost had given commandments unto the
[54:37] apostles whom he had chosen, to whom
[54:41] also he showed himself alive after his
[54:43] passion by many infallible proofs, being
[54:47] seen of them 40 days, and speaking of
[54:49] things pertaining to the kingdom of God,
[54:52] and being assembled together with them,
[54:54] commanded them that they should not
[54:56] depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
[54:59] promise of the Father, which saith he,
[55:02] Ye have heard of me. For John truly
[55:05] baptized with water, but you shall be
[55:08] baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many
[55:11] days hence." And when there they
[55:14] therefore were come together, they asked
[55:17] of him, saying, Lord, wil thou restore
[55:19] again the kingdom to Israel. And he
[55:22] said, "It is not for you to know the
[55:24] times or the seasons which the Father
[55:26] hath put in in his own power, but you
[55:30] shall receive power after that the Holy
[55:34] Ghost is come upon you, and you shall be
[55:37] witnesses unto me in both in Jerusalem
[55:40] and in Judea, and in Samaria, and under
[55:43] the uttermost parts of the earth." And
[55:45] when he had spoken these things, while
[55:47] they beheld, he was taken up, and a
[55:50] cloud received him out of their sight.
[55:52] And while they looked steadfastly toward
[55:55] the heaven, as he went up, behold, two
[55:58] men stood by them in white apparel,
[56:00] which also said, "Ye men of Galilee, why
[56:03] stand ye gazing up into heaven? This
[56:07] same Jesus which is taken up from you
[56:10] into heaven shall so come in like manner
[56:13] as you have seen him go. So we find that
[56:17] now he is telling the people he's
[56:20] telling the disciples, amen, I want you
[56:22] to go to Jerusalem. He's breathed them
[56:25] upon them and said receive the Holy
[56:27] Ghost. And now he's telling them, I want
[56:30] you to go to Jerusalem and you shall
[56:33] receive not many days hence. Acts 2
[56:36] and1. Amen. It says, "And the day of
[56:38] Pentecost was fully come, and they were
[56:41] all in one accord in one place. And
[56:44] suddenly there come a sound from heaven
[56:47] as of a rushing mighty wind, and it
[56:50] filled all the house where they were
[56:52] sitting. And there appeared unto them
[56:55] cloven tongues like as a fire, and it
[56:58] set upon them. And they were filled with
[57:01] the Holy Ghost and began to speak with
[57:04] other tongues as the Spirit gave them
[57:05] utterance. And there were dwelling at
[57:08] Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every
[57:11] nation under heaven. And now when this
[57:13] was noised abroad, the multitude come
[57:15] together and were confounded because
[57:18] that every man heard them in their own
[57:20] language. Amen. And so we we I wanted I
[57:25] know this was a little bit of reading
[57:26] here today, but I want us to go and I
[57:29] wanted us to understand, Amen. that
[57:32] Jesus was fixing to go. Amen. And he's
[57:35] going to call those who he had purchased
[57:38] with his own blood. Those who he had
[57:41] saved,
[57:44] he had died to redeem. Amen. Jesus paid
[57:48] the price. He was crucified. our sins
[57:52] were crucified with them. He is raised
[57:54] from the dead and he is now telling
[57:56] them, "Amen. Now my life that is within
[58:00] me is going to come upon you and you
[58:04] shall be witnesses of this
[58:07] resurrection." Amen. Aren't you glad for
[58:10] that? Now, Christianity is not a
[58:12] religion. Amen. Where you It's a
[58:16] one-time fix all where where we're just
[58:19] coming to church. We've we've accepted
[58:21] Jesus. Amen. We've been baptized. We've
[58:24] had the right hand of fellowship from
[58:25] the church. And then that that settles
[58:27] it. But you see, the reason that Jesus
[58:30] saved us is because he wants to live in
[58:34] you. Amen. He's not wanting to just live
[58:37] in the preacher. He's not wanting to
[58:39] just live in the deacon, but he wants to
[58:41] live in every one of you. Amen. The life
[58:45] of God coming within you. Praise the
[58:48] name of the Lord. Amen. There in in
[58:50] Romans 6 and and and and six it amen in
[58:54] the NIV version. I'm going to read it to
[58:56] you. It says, "We know that our old self
[59:00] was crucified with him so that the body
[59:03] that was ruled by sin might be done away
[59:06] with that we should no longer be slaves
[59:09] to sin." Because anyone who has died,
[59:13] amen, with Christ has been set free from
[59:17] the power of sin. And if we've died with
[59:20] Christ, we believe we shall also live
[59:25] with him. Amen. Now, that does something
[59:27] for me because, Amen. He didn't just
[59:30] keep us as sinners, but when he breathes
[59:33] the breath of life, Amen. His life comes
[59:38] in you and you begin to live again.
[59:42] Amen. You begin to live. The life that
[59:45] God lived in Christ is being lived in
[59:49] you. Now, I want us to look at at a few
[59:52] things here this morning because we were
[59:55] all spiritually dead. Every one of us
[59:58] when we were born, we Amen. We we were
[1:00:01] dead to righteousness and we were alive
[1:00:04] to sin. Sin ruled and reigned in us. Sin
[1:00:08] was part of our desire. It was it was it
[1:00:11] was part of our makeup. Amen. A a person
[1:00:15] that is that is alive to sin, he craves
[1:00:19] sin. He loves sin. He Amen. He He wants
[1:00:23] to do the things, Amen. of of the world.
[1:00:27] And And so when you are alive to sin,
[1:00:30] you are dead to righteousness. You are
[1:00:32] dead to to to to God. Amen. In other
[1:00:36] words, your soul is a slave to sin. But
[1:00:41] Jesus came, Amen. so that he can break
[1:00:46] the strongholds of sin and raise you up
[1:00:50] in the life of the and the power of
[1:00:52] Jesus Christ. Now there in first uh
[1:00:55] Timothy 5 and6 the scripture says she
[1:00:58] that liveth in pleasure or liveth in sin
[1:01:03] is dead while she lives. So so there are
[1:01:06] the the the sinner amen is dead while he
[1:01:11] lives. Dead while she lives. So so you
[1:01:14] you are alive in your body but your
[1:01:18] spirit being is dead. Amen. Dead to the
[1:01:21] things of God. get to the uh it's it's
[1:01:25] like you have amnesia. You don't
[1:01:27] remember uh uh who you really are and
[1:01:31] what you were really called for. There's
[1:01:33] many times uh people are in in in our
[1:01:36] world, in our society. Amen. And I want
[1:01:39] to tell you, there's a lot of dead
[1:01:41] people that's walking around.
[1:01:42] Hallelujah. Out here in the world now.
[1:01:45] Now, they're alive. Amen. You can talk
[1:01:48] to them. You can uh they they have
[1:01:50] families but they are dead to in in sin
[1:01:55] in trespasses. Their their desires amen
[1:01:59] is to that of the world. Praise the
[1:02:02] Lord. Amen. So we were spiritually dead.
[1:02:06] But Jesus comes to give us eternal life.
[1:02:10] Amen. To quicken your soul to eternal
[1:02:14] life. They're they're in they're in John
[1:02:16] 5 and 24. It says, "Verily, verily, I
[1:02:20] say unto you, he that hears my words and
[1:02:24] believes on him that sent me has
[1:02:27] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:02:31] judgment, but is passed from death unto
[1:02:35] life." Now, now I I want us to Amen to
[1:02:39] catch this because you can be dead while
[1:02:43] living. Hallelujah. And then you can be
[1:02:46] alive while dying.
[1:02:49] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. You can be
[1:02:52] dead while alive. Amen. But what what
[1:02:56] what causes people to to to to kill and
[1:03:00] and and to uh uh murder and you know do
[1:03:04] all of these things is because they are
[1:03:07] they are dead in sin. But when Christ
[1:03:10] comes to give life, it's eternal life on
[1:03:16] the inside of you. You have a soul that
[1:03:19] was ordained of God before the
[1:03:22] foundation of the world. Now he says,
[1:03:24] "But is passed from death unto life." He
[1:03:27] says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:03:29] the hour is coming, and now is when the
[1:03:32] dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
[1:03:36] God, and they shall live."
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. you when you're coming to
[1:03:42] church here this morning, you're not
[1:03:43] just coming to to just uh uh you know
[1:03:48] attend a church, but we are here under
[1:03:52] the presence of God and God is there to
[1:03:57] give life that there in there in in John
[1:04:01] 5 and 39 he he was telling the Pharisees
[1:04:04] he said search the scriptures man they
[1:04:07] were giving him a hard time and he said
[1:04:08] search the scriptures in them you think
[1:04:10] you have eternal life, and they are they
[1:04:13] which testify of me, and yet you will
[1:04:16] not come to me that you might have life.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You see, they were saying, "I'm alive. I
[1:04:26] go to church." Amen. I am I I I I'm a
[1:04:30] preacher. Amen. And Jesus was saying,
[1:04:34] "You're dead."
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus called them in one place. He says,
[1:04:40] "You are sepacers full of dead men's
[1:04:44] bones." He's telling them, "You are a
[1:04:46] tomb full of dead men's bones." And
[1:04:49] there they were walking and talking.
[1:04:51] Amen. So, he's not talking about the
[1:04:54] body. He was talking about that soul.
[1:04:59] And that is what I want us to talk about
[1:05:01] this morning because the Holy Ghost when
[1:05:04] the breath of life comes in, it is
[1:05:07] breathing into your soul to where you
[1:05:12] can you can live lot.
[1:05:16] I'm not talking about your body now. I'm
[1:05:18] talking about your soul living in the
[1:05:22] presence of God. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:05:25] that there in Ephesians 2 and five. He
[1:05:28] he says, "You were once dead to
[1:05:30] righteousness." Amen. But now you're
[1:05:32] made alive. Look at this. They're there.
[1:05:34] In Ephesians 2 and five, he says, "Even
[1:05:36] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[1:05:42] us together with Christ
[1:05:46] there in there in Colossians 2 and 13.
[1:05:49] And you being dead in your sins, and the
[1:05:53] uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he
[1:05:56] quickened together with him, having
[1:06:00] forgiven you of your trespasses. You
[1:06:03] know what that tells me? Amen. In order
[1:06:05] what what does it mean to quicken? Amen.
[1:06:08] Now, my wife's been been taking care of
[1:06:10] her plants and things out there in the
[1:06:12] yard and and uh she'll put seeds in the
[1:06:15] grounds and and and and what have you.
[1:06:17] Amen. There's got to be a seed in the
[1:06:20] ground in order for a seed to be
[1:06:23] quickened.
[1:06:25] Hallelujah. Amen. You can you can pour
[1:06:27] water right here on this carpet. Amen.
[1:06:30] And and shine light on that carpet, but
[1:06:32] it ain't going to produce a flower
[1:06:34] because there's no seed there. But yet,
[1:06:38] Amen. Now, now catch this. The Bible
[1:06:41] says there in Ephesians 1 and4, we were
[1:06:44] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[1:06:48] of the world. So there was a seed that
[1:06:51] was planted on the inside of your body
[1:06:55] before you ever come to planet Earth.
[1:06:57] And you were just needing life. You were
[1:07:00] needing the sunlight of God to come and
[1:07:03] make that to live.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. The Bible says
[1:07:09] that your names were written in the
[1:07:13] lamb's book of life before the
[1:07:16] foundation of the world.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; That means God knew all of his children.
[1:07:22] The Bible says that you were a son of
[1:07:24] God. Amen. And there is no man, there's
[1:07:28] no devil, there is no there's no
[1:07:31] preacher, there's no sin that can pluck
[1:07:34] you out of his hands.
[1:07:37] Amen. That's That's exactly right. I I
[1:07:40] I've got a scripture here that Amen. And
[1:07:42] I I don't know if I'll be able to find
[1:07:43] it uh uh uh just at at this point. Amen.
[1:07:47] But but he was but but Jesus was talking
[1:07:50] about. Amen. My sheep know my voice and
[1:07:54] they will not follow another. Amen. And
[1:07:56] he says, "And I will keep them. I will
[1:08:00] save them and raise them up at the last
[1:08:03] day." Amen. Well, I I I I'm just
[1:08:06] thankful for that here this morning. So,
[1:08:07] the seeds of God, there was if you were
[1:08:11] a son of God today, you always were a
[1:08:15] son.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I I was in my my
[1:08:20] father. I was in my grandfather. I was
[1:08:23] in my greatgrandfather.
[1:08:26] Amen. In the genetics. And if you are a
[1:08:29] son of God, you were always in the mind
[1:08:33] of God. God knew you. He loved you. And
[1:08:38] he provided a lamb for you.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; He knew that you were going to Amen. be
[1:08:46] living. Your soul would be a lying in a
[1:08:50] in that body of yours and that sin would
[1:08:53] take over and that sin would rule you.
[1:08:56] Amen. sin would dominate you. But he
[1:08:59] also knew that he was going to breathe
[1:09:02] the breath of life into that soul and
[1:09:06] that soul would be quickened by his holy
[1:09:09] spirit and you would live in the
[1:09:12] presence of the Lord.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of Jesus. So
[1:09:16] receiving the Holy Ghost, amen, is God's
[1:09:20] breath, his very own breath, breathing
[1:09:24] into you and making new life within you.
[1:09:28] Oh, bless the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:31] Now, some people don't like to think
[1:09:32] that that that that some Amen. were
[1:09:35] called of God and and and and and uh
[1:09:38] Amen. that that God can, you know, but
[1:09:40] the Bible says there in the book of uh
[1:09:43] Romans uh the 8th chapter. Amen. And
[1:09:47] we'll just read that real quickly there
[1:09:49] in Romans the 8th chapter.
[1:09:52] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. The
[1:09:54] 29th verse, it says, "For whom he did
[1:09:57] forno." So God knew God. There's a there
[1:10:02] is a person there is a group that God
[1:10:06] forneew. Someone say amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; He also did predestinate
[1:10:13] to be conformed to the image of his son.
[1:10:16] What does that word predestinate?
[1:10:19] Predetermine
[1:10:21] that they would be in the image of his
[1:10:24] son. And yet every one of you were born
[1:10:28] in sin. You were dead in sin. You were
[1:10:32] shapen in iniquity. Hallelujah. But now
[1:10:36] watch. Amen. Watch. Watch God. Look,
[1:10:38] look at what God is saying. Whom he did
[1:10:40] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:10:41] image of a son, that he might be the
[1:10:43] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[1:10:45] whom he did predestinate,
[1:10:48] them he also called. This is all past
[1:10:50] tense. Whom he called, them he
[1:10:52] justified. Whom he justified, he also
[1:10:56] glorified. What shall we say then to
[1:10:59] these things? If God be for us, who can
[1:11:03] be against us?
[1:11:06] Now, while you were living in sin,
[1:11:09] Amen. you were a son of God, you were a
[1:11:13] daughter of God. Amen. But you were dead
[1:11:17] in sin. And you were well, glory to God.
[1:11:21] But when God, Christ comes to save that
[1:11:25] soul, he comes so that his life can come
[1:11:29] back in you and he can live that eternal
[1:11:33] life. Well, somebody should shout here
[1:11:34] this morning.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's look
[1:11:40] at something just and I know this is
[1:11:42] this may be a little bit deep here.
[1:11:44] Amen. But let's look here. Let's go to
[1:11:46] Romans the 9th chapter. Hallelujah. And
[1:11:50] u uh you know uh he's he's talking about
[1:11:54] you and me and and he and he's comparing
[1:11:56] us to the Old Testament when when God
[1:11:59] called Abraham and gave him a promise of
[1:12:02] Isaac and and uh Amen. And he and he and
[1:12:06] he's and he's talking about how that God
[1:12:09] chose Isaac. Amen. He put his hand upon
[1:12:12] Isaac instead of Ishmael. And and so
[1:12:15] we're just going to break in here. and
[1:12:17] and he uh he says now the eighth verse
[1:12:20] he says that is they which are the
[1:12:23] children of the flesh. They are not the
[1:12:25] children of God but the children of the
[1:12:27] promise are counted for the seed. For
[1:12:30] this is the word of promise. At this
[1:12:32] time I will come and Sarah shall have a
[1:12:35] son. And not only this but when Rebecca
[1:12:39] also had conceived by one even by our
[1:12:41] father Isaac. For the children being not
[1:12:45] yet born, neither having done any good
[1:12:49] or evil, that the purpose of God
[1:12:54] according to election might stand, not
[1:12:57] of works, but of him that calleth. It
[1:13:00] was said unto her, the elder shall serve
[1:13:02] the younger. As it is written, Jacob
[1:13:05] have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
[1:13:08] What shall we say then? Is there
[1:13:10] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
[1:13:14] For he says to Moses, I will have mercy
[1:13:17] on whom I will have mercy. I will have
[1:13:20] compassion on whom I will have
[1:13:23] compassion. So it is not of him that
[1:13:26] willth nor of him that runs, but of God
[1:13:30] that shows mercy. What I am saying is
[1:13:35] you were always a son of God. You were
[1:13:39] always ordained of God. Even when you
[1:13:42] were out count uh painting the the town
[1:13:45] red. Even when you were out there as
[1:13:47] filthy, they meant in the sin and the
[1:13:49] muck and the meer. You were a son of
[1:13:52] God. When you were out there in the
[1:13:54] bars, when you were in the honky tonks,
[1:13:56] when you were out there as high and out
[1:13:58] of your mind as can be. Amen. You were
[1:14:01] always a son and daughter of God. Amen.
[1:14:05] But you were dead to the things of God.
[1:14:08] Amen. That's why Jesus had to die. He
[1:14:11] died so that you could live.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Amen. God loved
[1:14:21] you there. Hallelujah. Amen. The Bible
[1:14:24] says, The Bible says that your names
[1:14:28] were written in the Lamb's book of life
[1:14:31] before the foundation of the world.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Now,
[1:14:38] hallelujah. So, it's not of him that
[1:14:39] wills, nor of him that that that runs,
[1:14:43] but it's him that God shows mercy. Amen.
[1:14:48] That's right. A and he says, therefore,
[1:14:50] Amen. The 18th verse, therefore he has
[1:14:52] mercy on whom he'll have mercy, and whom
[1:14:54] he will he hardeneth. Whil thou say
[1:14:57] then, why do he yet find fault? Who hath
[1:14:59] resisted his will? 20th verse. Nay, but
[1:15:02] oh man, who art thou that repliest
[1:15:04] against God? Shall the thing formed, say
[1:15:07] to the thing that formed it, Amen. To
[1:15:09] him that formed it, why hast thou made
[1:15:10] me thus? Hath not the potter power over
[1:15:14] the clay of the same lump to make one
[1:15:17] vessel unto honor and another unto
[1:15:20] dishonor? Now, now the reason, Amen, I'm
[1:15:23] bringing this in is because there has to
[1:15:26] be something in you to be quickened.
[1:15:30] When the breath of God comes in, there's
[1:15:33] got to be there's got to be a soul that
[1:15:37] God can quicken.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Now, in in Pentecost, people think that,
[1:15:43] Amen. the Holy Ghost is is a lot of
[1:15:46] making you feel good and a lot of
[1:15:47] shouting and and and I love to shout and
[1:15:49] I love to feel good and I and I and I
[1:15:51] love preaching when you're feeling good.
[1:15:53] Hallelujah. Amen. I love those kinds of
[1:15:55] services. But you see it is not that the
[1:15:59] Holy Ghost is not an emotion. The Holy
[1:16:02] Ghost is the very life of God. Amen.
[1:16:06] That is breathed into your soul and you
[1:16:09] become a new creation.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what the scripture says. The
[1:16:15] scripture says that you become a brand
[1:16:16] new creation. Old things have passed
[1:16:19] away and behold, all things become new.
[1:16:21] Oh, hallelujah. Amen. You're you're no
[1:16:24] longer wanting to go drink and and honky
[1:16:26] tonk and and live it up. You're no
[1:16:28] longer fighting the Bible. Now the life
[1:16:30] of God has has energized your soul and
[1:16:33] you believe exactly the way God
[1:16:35] believes. You're not saying, "Well, I'm
[1:16:37] a Christian like this." Ain't that you
[1:16:38] can't be a Christian unless the Holy
[1:16:41] Ghost comes in you and lives that life
[1:16:43] in you. You you you're just not a
[1:16:45] Christian until you have received the
[1:16:48] breath of God into your soul. That's the
[1:16:51] only way you're a Christian.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My sheep hear my voice and
[1:16:58] another they will not follow. When you
[1:17:01] have the Holy Ghost, you're going to
[1:17:04] follow the spirit of God. Amen. If you
[1:17:07] don't have the spirit of God, you're
[1:17:10] going to hell.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; There's no other way around it. But God
[1:17:15] says, "I've got an eternal purpose for
[1:17:17] you. I've come to redeem you. I've come
[1:17:21] to bring you back. I've come to save you
[1:17:25] and to give you eternal life. Well, can
[1:17:28] I hear an amen?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God so loved the world that
[1:17:34] he gave.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now the scripture says, Amen.
[1:17:42] In Romans 6 and 11, likewise reckon ye
[1:17:46] also yourselves dead indeed unto sin,
[1:17:49] but alive unto God through Jesus. Now
[1:17:53] you were dead to righteousness and alive
[1:17:56] to sin. Now you're alive to
[1:17:59] righteousness and dead to sin. Amen.
[1:18:02] John 11:25. Amen. Jesus said unto her,
[1:18:05] "I am the resurrection and the life. And
[1:18:06] he that believeth in me, though he were
[1:18:08] dead, yet he shall live. Whosoever,
[1:18:11] amen, spiritually lives and believeth in
[1:18:15] me shall never die.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; He that liveth and believeth
[1:18:25] shall never die.
[1:18:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you saying, "Now, listen.
[1:18:31] I've I've buried my grandma, and she was
[1:18:33] a good lady. She was a Christian lady. I
[1:18:36] buried my Amen. And she and he was a he
[1:18:38] was a Christian. Amen. He that receives
[1:18:42] this life shall never die. What's he
[1:18:46] talk? He's not talking about this body
[1:18:47] here.
[1:18:50] This body here is going to go to the
[1:18:52] grave. Amen. There's some of you here
[1:18:54] that are that have that are getting that
[1:18:56] have got some gray hair. Amen. Maybe
[1:18:58] you're on a cane. May maybe maybe you're
[1:19:00] fighting. You know, my my dad's at home
[1:19:02] just he sent me a text wishing he could
[1:19:04] be here. Amen. and and but there's a lot
[1:19:07] of those kinds of things. But I just I
[1:19:09] just want to let you know, amen, when
[1:19:11] you have received the breath of God,
[1:19:14] amen, into your soul, you are alive.
[1:19:19] And the scripture says, amen, there in
[1:19:22] in in 1 Corinthians 5 and 1 in and and
[1:19:25] I'm going to read this in the amplified
[1:19:26] version. He says, "And we know that if
[1:19:29] our if the earthly tent, our physical
[1:19:31] body, which is our house, is torn down
[1:19:34] through death, we have a building from
[1:19:38] God, a house not made with hands and
[1:19:42] eternal in the heaven. For indeed in
[1:19:44] this house, in this body, we grown
[1:19:47] longing to be clothed with our immortal
[1:19:50] eternal celestial dwelling." Can you say
[1:19:52] amen? Amen. So this body is dying. This
[1:19:56] body is decaying. God, hallelujah. God's
[1:20:00] not as much interested in this old body
[1:20:02] here as he is interested in that soul.
[1:20:05] Amen. The death of the body is not the
[1:20:07] end of you. Your soul lives in your you.
[1:20:11] The real you is living inside that body.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; You have never seen me.
[1:20:19] You have never seen me. You just see the
[1:20:21] house that I'm living in.
[1:20:25] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:20:28] And and you can and you can paint the
[1:20:30] old house and you can you can comb the
[1:20:33] hair of that old house and you can but
[1:20:36] that old house is decaying.
[1:20:39] This old house is going down to the
[1:20:40] grave. That ain't come on. Hallelujah.
[1:20:44] And there ain't nothing I can do. I'm
[1:20:46] telling you what. Amen. I've tried
[1:20:48] everything. They they told me massage
[1:20:49] your scalp. You got to you got to to to
[1:20:52] help your hair. Amen. You got to bend
[1:20:54] over and and let all the blood go down
[1:20:56] and the massage it. Well, I've I've I'm
[1:20:58] glad there's not not videos of me in the
[1:21:01] shower. Amen. And uh trying to get the
[1:21:04] blood just flowing. Amen. And doing
[1:21:07] this, that, and the other. Amen. This
[1:21:09] old house there is it's condemned. This
[1:21:12] old house is going to go, Amen. to the
[1:21:15] grave. This old house, it there's
[1:21:17] there's nothing here. But I just want to
[1:21:20] tell you, don't you Amen. Don't you uh
[1:21:23] identify the real me with this house. I
[1:21:28] have eternal life living in me. This
[1:21:31] soul has eternal life. I'm not living
[1:21:35] for this body. I'm not I'm not I'm not
[1:21:38] dying for this body. I've got a call.
[1:21:42] I've got a promise that when this house,
[1:21:45] amen, is condemned and thrown aside,
[1:21:48] there is already a brand new house
[1:21:51] waiting for me on the other side. Can
[1:21:54] you say amen? The breath of life does
[1:21:57] not affect this as much as it affects
[1:22:01] your soul.
[1:22:05] Now,
[1:22:07] if you live in a house
[1:22:11] and and you can tell by the nature of
[1:22:14] your of of how that house is, you can
[1:22:17] tell the nature of the person that lives
[1:22:20] on the inside of it. If it's cluttered
[1:22:21] and there's this, that, and the other,
[1:22:22] well, that sort of lets you know that,
[1:22:24] okay, well, there's a hoarder that lives
[1:22:25] on the inside, you know, or and uh uh
[1:22:29] and don't be pointing fingers at me.
[1:22:30] Amen. and and but but if you've got uh
[1:22:34] you know if if if if the house is it it
[1:22:37] tells what nature is on the inside. And
[1:22:41] so if you have eternal life and the
[1:22:44] breath of life has come into your lives.
[1:22:47] Amen. It it it is it is it is it is seen
[1:22:51] on the outside. It's seen in this body.
[1:22:54] Amen. If the desire of my of my soul is
[1:22:59] to love God to please the Lord, then I
[1:23:02] am reading his Bible. I am coming to
[1:23:05] church. I am doing what God asked. So
[1:23:08] this house does this body does what my
[1:23:12] soul is desiring. But if it is desiring
[1:23:15] sin, it's going to want cigarettes.
[1:23:17] Amen. If it's wanting cigarettes, your
[1:23:19] body's going to Amen. It's going to
[1:23:21] oblige. If if if your desire on the
[1:23:23] inside of you is desiring drugs, Amen.
[1:23:26] and you're going to do smoke your
[1:23:28] marijuana and you're going to do all of
[1:23:29] that kind of amen uh uh devilish things
[1:23:32] to your to to your spirit and your body.
[1:23:35] Amen. It shows what life is on the
[1:23:38] inside of you. It shows where you are.
[1:23:41] Amen. That's the reason why when we give
[1:23:44] our spirit, our soul to God and he
[1:23:47] revives us. Amen. and he breathes his
[1:23:51] life into us. Our desires is for him to
[1:23:55] have total control of me at all times.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; I don't want my mind going into a amen
[1:24:06] state of relaxation where devils can
[1:24:09] minister to me where devils can things
[1:24:12] amen
[1:24:14] and you can have illusions and you can
[1:24:16] do these kinds of things. That's not
[1:24:18] God's design for you.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; God's peace comes through his life. His
[1:24:28] life in you is what brings peace in you.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. In Pentecost, back
[1:24:37] Amen. back back in the day, uh, and not
[1:24:40] necessarily in our church, but in our in
[1:24:42] in our circles, they would they would go
[1:24:44] on those 40-day fasts and and they would
[1:24:46] they they would they would do this thing
[1:24:48] where, Amen. You you couldn't eat or you
[1:24:50] couldn't drink. And Amen. or
[1:24:51] occasionally you could you could take a
[1:24:53] little drink. And and what they would do
[1:24:55] is they were trying to get themselves
[1:24:56] into a place to where their their spirit
[1:24:59] their their mind can be more sensitive
[1:25:01] to God. Amen. And they found themselves
[1:25:03] to be subject to devils. They found
[1:25:06] themselves having visions and dreams and
[1:25:08] and hallucinations and things of that
[1:25:10] nature. That is not what God's wanting.
[1:25:13] God's wanting his life to live on the
[1:25:15] inside of you and that life will reflect
[1:25:19] itself through the windows of your
[1:25:21] house. Well, somebody shout amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if my desire is heaven, then
[1:25:28] his word is what I'm looking for. If my
[1:25:31] desire is for a new life, then his then
[1:25:34] then my body is following along in that.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the whole world will
[1:25:42] be deceived in this last day before the
[1:25:45] coming of the Lord.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the world will be
[1:25:50] deceived because they will have itching
[1:25:52] ears and they will heap to themselves
[1:25:55] teachers, teachers, and they'll all be
[1:25:57] turned to fables. people that'll say,
[1:25:59] "Oh, you're okay." Oh, yeah. That's just
[1:26:02] fine. I'm here to tell you, this
[1:26:03] preacher is telling you, you better get
[1:26:05] right or you will not make that rapture.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. Can you say
[1:26:12] amen? So, the death of the body is not
[1:26:15] the end of you. Well, glory to God.
[1:26:18] Amen. They're they're in they're in 1
[1:26:20] Corinthians uh or 2 Corinthians 5:6
[1:26:23] there where therefore we are always
[1:26:25] confident knowing this while we are at
[1:26:28] home or living in the body we are absent
[1:26:31] from the Lord for we walk by faith and
[1:26:34] not by sight. We are confident I say
[1:26:37] willing rather to be absent from the
[1:26:40] body to and to be present with the Lord.
[1:26:42] So when you are absent from this body
[1:26:45] well glory to God I have preached many
[1:26:47] of funerals. Amen. I I I I I've preached
[1:26:50] many godly uh uh uh men and women have
[1:26:54] have have come and and I I have I you
[1:26:56] know we have we have laid them to rest.
[1:26:59] Bless the name of the Lord. Amen. And
[1:27:01] you know they are not there. That was
[1:27:04] just the house that they lived in.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Where are they at? They are present.
[1:27:11] What? That's what the Bible just said.
[1:27:13] To be absent from this body is to be
[1:27:16] present.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; So we put so much we put so much time we
[1:27:25] put so much emphasis on this body here
[1:27:29] and this is not what the Holy Ghost has
[1:27:31] come to do. Now back back in Pentecost,
[1:27:34] Amen. We loved when the Holy Ghost come
[1:27:37] because we got to dance and shout and
[1:27:39] scream. I listen we done it all, man. We
[1:27:41] done cartwheels. I mean we we had a good
[1:27:43] time. We we Hallelujah. But you see then
[1:27:46] then I find out that the Holy Ghost was
[1:27:49] not even come for this. The Holy Ghost
[1:27:52] has come to give life, the breath of
[1:27:55] life to my soul.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Am I making any sense here this morning?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. It says now, Amen.
[1:28:04] So there in Psalms 116 and 15, precious
[1:28:08] in the sight of the Lord is the death of
[1:28:13] his saints. Now, now I want you to catch
[1:28:17] Jesus is breathing the breath of life.
[1:28:19] Jesus is saying, "Whosoever
[1:28:23] that lives spiritually and believes in
[1:28:26] me shall never die." He's not talking
[1:28:30] about this old body here. Amen. For I
[1:28:33] just want to tell you, death is the
[1:28:35] doorway to that eternal land where
[1:28:38] there's a body that'll Hallelujah.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; There will be no diets over there in
[1:28:42] that other body. There will be no
[1:28:44] sickness in that other body. There will
[1:28:47] be no there will be no more shame. Oh,
[1:28:50] come on. In this body that we live in,
[1:28:52] there are so many shames and regrets
[1:28:53] that we go through. We there there there
[1:28:56] are certain people we see and we just
[1:28:57] think, "Oh, I've got regrets for
[1:28:59] something I done 30 years ago." Or we we
[1:29:01] we look at our we you know we look at
[1:29:04] our spouses and we say I've got regrets.
[1:29:06] We look at our children or maybe we look
[1:29:08] at our our parents and we've got
[1:29:10] regrets. But brother what we are
[1:29:12] preparing for is that other side friend.
[1:29:16] Amen. This old house has got to go. It's
[1:29:20] got to die. It's been condemned. But
[1:29:23] there is a body
[1:29:26] where there is no regrets. Where there
[1:29:28] is no failures. where there is no, well,
[1:29:31] glory to God. There's no complexes where
[1:29:35] you can look at everybody and you don't
[1:29:37] have to have a bad thought about
[1:29:38] yourself. Well, I this and that and and
[1:29:41] no, you're there. Amen. You've got a
[1:29:44] brand new body. You the Holy Spirit has
[1:29:46] preserved you and kept you alive.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:29:54] Now, now Jesus even sat I mean there are
[1:29:57] several places in in in in there where
[1:30:00] where Jesus called the spirits back into
[1:30:03] a body. Amen. Now my is is this okay
[1:30:06] here this morning?
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; There there in Mark 5 and39 it says and
[1:30:09] when he was come in he saith unto them
[1:30:12] why why make ye this do and weep? The
[1:30:14] damsel is not dead but sleepeth. and
[1:30:16] they laughed him to scorn. But when he
[1:30:19] had put them all out, he takes the
[1:30:22] father and mother of the damsel and that
[1:30:24] were with him and enters in where the
[1:30:26] damsel is lying. And he took the damsel
[1:30:28] by the hand and said unto her, "Uh,
[1:30:31] Titha
[1:30:33] Kami Kumi," which is being interpreted,
[1:30:35] "Damesel, I say unto thee, arise." And
[1:30:37] straightway the damel arose and walked,
[1:30:40] for she was of the age of 12, and they
[1:30:42] were astonished with great astonishment.
[1:30:44] So, here it's going. The girl was laying
[1:30:47] there dead, but Jesus turns around and
[1:30:49] says, "She sleeps." Hallelujah. Y'all
[1:30:51] y'all remember Lazarus? Lazarus. Amen.
[1:30:54] Lazarus had died. And Jesus says,
[1:30:57] "Amen." Jesus tells his disciples, "I go
[1:31:00] to wake him." And and the disciples were
[1:31:02] relieved and said, "Oh, good. He's not
[1:31:04] dead." And then Jesus turned around
[1:31:06] plainly and said, "Lazarus is dead, and
[1:31:10] I'm glad for your sakes I was not
[1:31:13] there." Amen. And and and so they they
[1:31:16] all go to Lazarus there in John 11:32.
[1:31:19] And it says, "And then when Mary was
[1:31:21] come where where Jesus was and saw him,
[1:31:23] she fell down at his feet, and she said,
[1:31:24] Lord, if thou hast been here, my brother
[1:31:26] had not died." And when Jesus therefore
[1:31:28] saw her weeping, and the Jews also
[1:31:30] weeping, he groaned in his spirit and
[1:31:32] was troubled and said, "Where have you
[1:31:33] laid him?" And and and they said unto
[1:31:35] him, "Lord, come and see." And Jesus
[1:31:37] wept. And then said the disciples, "Oh,
[1:31:40] behold how he loved him." And some of
[1:31:42] them said, "Could not this man which
[1:31:44] have opened the eyes of the blind have
[1:31:46] caused that even this man should not
[1:31:48] have died?" Jesus therefore groaned
[1:31:51] again, groaned in himself. And he comes
[1:31:54] to the grave. It was a cave and a stone
[1:31:56] laid over it. And Jesus said, "Take away
[1:31:58] the stone." And Martha, the sister of
[1:32:00] him that was dead, said unto him, Lord,
[1:32:03] by the time by this time he stinks, for
[1:32:05] he's been dead for 4 days. And Jesus
[1:32:08] said unto her, Said not I unto thee,
[1:32:11] said I not unto thee, that if thou
[1:32:13] wouldest believe, thou should see the
[1:32:15] glory of God. And when they took away
[1:32:17] the stone from the place where the dead
[1:32:18] was laid, Jesus lifted up his eyes and
[1:32:21] said, "Father, I thank you that thou has
[1:32:23] heard me. I knew that thou hearest me
[1:32:26] always, but because of the people would
[1:32:29] stand by, uh, I I said it, that they may
[1:32:32] believe that thou has sent me." And when
[1:32:34] he had this spoken, he cried with a loud
[1:32:35] voice, "Lazarus, come forth." And he
[1:32:39] that was dead came forth, bound hand and
[1:32:42] foot, with grave clothes, and his face
[1:32:45] was bound about with a napkin. And Jesus
[1:32:48] said unto them, "Loose him, and let him
[1:32:50] go."
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; So, you're not dead when you're dead.
[1:32:57] Well, praise the Lord. Your spirit has
[1:33:01] just moved out. Now, that's the
[1:33:04] Christian and the non-Christian alike.
[1:33:08] Amen. Now, when you when you die, I
[1:33:11] don't care. Hitler. Amen. I guess we all
[1:33:14] know how evil Hitler is. Hitler is still
[1:33:17] alive. You say, "No, he died." And the
[1:33:21] world's a better place since he's died.
[1:33:23] Hitler,
[1:33:25] his soul is still alive. And the Bible
[1:33:28] says it is appointed unto man once to
[1:33:31] die and then the judgment. So he's he's
[1:33:35] waiting to stand. Now will he live
[1:33:37] forever? No. No. Amen.
[1:33:41] There will come a time where the soul
[1:33:43] will die. But the Holy Spirit in you is
[1:33:48] preparing you to live forever.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Now this is what
[1:33:58] they would call the second death. Amen.
[1:34:01] Now the second death is is is
[1:34:04] the sinful soul will come to an end.
[1:34:07] That soul will be eternally separated
[1:34:09] from God. There in Matthew 10:28 Jesus
[1:34:11] said, "Fear not them which can kill the
[1:34:14] body but are a but are not able to kill
[1:34:17] the soul, but rather fear him that is
[1:34:20] able to destroy both the soul and the
[1:34:23] body in hell." Amen. Who are these? They
[1:34:27] were dead in sin. They were dead to in
[1:34:32] sin and dead in sin. Dead to
[1:34:36] righteousness.
[1:34:38] They did not receive the breath of life
[1:34:42] from God.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:50] Now
[1:34:52] the the Bible would talk about those who
[1:34:55] that they're in in in Romans 1 and 21
[1:34:57] and it says because when they knew God
[1:35:01] they glorified him not as God neither
[1:35:03] were thankful but they but become vain
[1:35:05] in their imaginations and their foolish
[1:35:07] heart was darkened professing themselves
[1:35:10] to be wise they become fools. They
[1:35:13] changed the glory of the incorruptible
[1:35:15] God into an image like to the
[1:35:17] corruptable man or to birds, to
[1:35:19] for-footed beasts, to creeping things.
[1:35:22] Wherefore God also gave them up to
[1:35:25] uncleanness through the lust of their
[1:35:27] own heart to dishonor their own bodies
[1:35:29] between themselves, who changed the
[1:35:32] truth of God into a lie, and worshiped
[1:35:34] and served the creature more than the
[1:35:37] creator who was blessed forever more.
[1:35:40] Hebrews 10:29. How much sorer punishment
[1:35:43] suppose ye shall he be thought worthy
[1:35:45] who hath trotten under the foot the son
[1:35:48] of God and have counted the blood of the
[1:35:50] covenant wherewith he was sanctified an
[1:35:52] unholy thing and has done despite unto
[1:35:56] the spirit of grace.
[1:35:58] So there will be those who have been re
[1:36:00] who has been given that opportunity
[1:36:04] but they have they have decided amen
[1:36:08] that that they do not want life. Now I'm
[1:36:12] going to that's the second death. Let's
[1:36:14] let's just read here in Revelations 20
[1:36:17] and 11. I want to bring this in before
[1:36:19] we go on in. Amen. To the good stuff.
[1:36:21] Hallelujah. I saw a great white throne.
[1:36:23] This is this is after amen. This is this
[1:36:26] is after the rapture. Amen. This now all
[1:36:29] of the dead. All of the dead are all
[1:36:33] brought together. This the second
[1:36:35] resurrection now.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he and he and and he said, "I
[1:36:39] saw a white throne in him that sat on it
[1:36:41] from whom the face of the earth and the
[1:36:43] heaven fled away and there was found no
[1:36:46] place for them. I saw the dead, small
[1:36:48] and great, stand before God. The books
[1:36:51] were open and another book was open
[1:36:53] which is the book of life. And the dead
[1:36:55] were judged out of those things which
[1:36:57] were written in the books according to
[1:36:59] their works. And the sea gave up the
[1:37:01] dead which were in it. And the death and
[1:37:03] hell delivered up the dead which were in
[1:37:05] them. And they were judged every man
[1:37:07] according to their works. And death and
[1:37:10] hell were cast into the lake of fire.
[1:37:12] This is the second death. And whosoever
[1:37:16] was not found written in the book of
[1:37:18] life was cast into the lake of fire. So
[1:37:22] this is the ones who did not receive
[1:37:25] someone smile at me here this morning.
[1:37:28] Amen. They did not receive the life of
[1:37:32] God that God gave them through Jesus
[1:37:35] Christ.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But did you know that the
[1:37:42] Bible says that there is a group of
[1:37:44] people that that second death will have
[1:37:46] no hold on?
[1:37:51] There is Well, let's just read it there.
[1:37:52] There in there in in in in Revelations 2
[1:37:55] and 11. He that have an ear, let him
[1:37:57] hear what the spirit says unto the
[1:37:58] churches. He that overcomemeth
[1:38:01] shall not be hurt of the second death.
[1:38:05] Revelations 20 and 6. Blessed and holy
[1:38:08] is he that has a part in the first
[1:38:10] resurrection. On such the second death
[1:38:14] hath no power, for they shall be priests
[1:38:17] of God and of Christ, and shall reign
[1:38:19] with him a thousand years.
[1:38:22] What's the difference? Somebody
[1:38:25] has received the breath of God.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody has gone beyond. Amen. I don't
[1:38:33] want to just be a church member, but I
[1:38:35] want the breath of God
[1:38:39] breathe upon me.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost to come upon me.
[1:38:47] It'll it'll make it'll it'll make you
[1:38:50] it'll make you different. Oh, come on
[1:38:53] now. Amen. It'll it'll it'll take all of
[1:38:56] those old things that once had you
[1:38:58] bound. Amen. The breath of God comes
[1:39:00] upon you. The same life that come upon
[1:39:03] the dead body of Jesus Christ and raised
[1:39:06] him from the dead is the same life that
[1:39:08] is breathing upon you and that is
[1:39:11] raising your soul from the dead on the
[1:39:14] inside of you. The oh come on church.
[1:39:16] Amen. What is it? As the apostle Paul as
[1:39:19] we read earlier, we were once dead in
[1:39:22] sin but now the life that was in Christ
[1:39:26] has quickened me and I'm living again.
[1:39:29] I'm living. Joy is living. Peace is
[1:39:32] living. Forgiveness is living. Amen. All
[1:39:34] of the attributes of God are now living
[1:39:37] in me.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. How h why why
[1:39:43] would I want to be miserable when I
[1:39:45] could be happy?
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Why why would I want to be amended
[1:39:50] and and in sin when God can set me free
[1:39:55] and he can give me joy and peace and
[1:39:57] eternal victory through him?
[1:40:02] Hallelujah. Well, glory. When you're a
[1:40:06] slave, you're subject to that. But when
[1:40:09] Jesus breathes in you, the chains
[1:40:13] are
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Oh, God. They're they're in
[1:40:19] they're in they're in in in in Romans
[1:40:21] the 8th chapter. If uh let me just read
[1:40:24] it to you again. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:27] Romans 8 and and 11. Amen. It says uh 8
[1:40:31] and10.
[1:40:34] It's uh well, let's see here. Amen.
[1:40:38] Romans 8:8. So they that are that are in
[1:40:40] the flesh cannot please God. But ye are
[1:40:43] not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if
[1:40:44] so, if the spirit of God dwell in you.
[1:40:46] Now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:40:48] Christ, he has none of his. But if
[1:40:50] Christ be in you, the body is dead
[1:40:51] because of sin, but the spirit is life
[1:40:53] because of righteousness. If the spirit
[1:40:56] of him that raised Jesus from the dead
[1:40:59] dwell in you, he that raised Jesus
[1:41:01] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:41:04] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:41:07] dwells in you. Therefore, brethren, we
[1:41:09] are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
[1:41:11] after the flesh. For if you live after
[1:41:13] the flesh, you shall die. But if you
[1:41:15] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[1:41:17] of the body, you shall live. For as many
[1:41:19] as are led by the spirit of God, they
[1:41:22] are the sons of God. You have not
[1:41:25] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:41:29] fear, but you have received the spirit
[1:41:31] of adoption whereby we cry aba father.
[1:41:34] The spirit itself bears witness with our
[1:41:36] spirit that we are the children of God.
[1:41:39] And if children then hes of God, joints
[1:41:43] with Christ, if so be that we suffer
[1:41:45] with him, we shall also be glorified
[1:41:47] together. Can I hear an amen?
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:53] Yes, God is he has resurrected us. So
[1:41:57] before the resurrection of these bodies,
[1:42:00] there's a resurrection of your soul.
[1:42:05] Before before you before we before the
[1:42:08] first resurrection, when we're all
[1:42:10] resurrected, there's first of all got to
[1:42:12] be the resurrection of the soul. The
[1:42:15] soul will live to God. Oh, hallel Aren't
[1:42:18] y'all understanding me? You see that? Do
[1:42:21] do you see how beautiful it is? You see
[1:42:24] you see this is why this is why we need
[1:42:26] some good gospel sound preaching these
[1:42:28] days because God is saying come out from
[1:42:32] among the wrath and the judgment because
[1:42:34] I've not called you to wrath. I've not
[1:42:36] called you to judgment. I've not called
[1:42:38] you to the second death. I've called you
[1:42:41] to eternal life
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; and peace and joy and
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; glory be.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's what he's
[1:42:50] called us to. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; I I I listen, I've been serving the God
[1:42:55] since the Lord since I was a a kid.
[1:42:58] Amen. And there's been a lot of things.
[1:43:00] I've made a lot of mistakes. I've made a
[1:43:02] lot of And I got to tell you, Amen. I I
[1:43:05] can look back and and and this old mind
[1:43:07] would take me down memories lane many a
[1:43:08] time. And it and it and and and even the
[1:43:11] devil will try to haunt me in dreams and
[1:43:13] he'll try to haunt me in this that and
[1:43:14] the other just things I've said or
[1:43:16] things I've done or Amen. ways I've
[1:43:19] acted. Amen. And and the devil will try
[1:43:21] to just constantly Amen. Ju just just
[1:43:23] constantly try to but I you know what I
[1:43:25] tell that old devil? I tell that old
[1:43:27] devil I am not that old man. Amen. The
[1:43:30] spirit of Christ has come upon me. He's
[1:43:33] living in me. Are you hearing me? This
[1:43:35] body, this mind will not make the rest.
[1:43:38] And even those of us who are alive, the
[1:43:40] Bible says we shall be changed.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the dead in Christ shall
[1:43:45] rise and we which are alive shall rise
[1:43:49] in the air to meet them and we shall be
[1:43:54] changed. That's what we're preparing
[1:43:56] for. Gray hair is gone. Amen. Bald heads
[1:44:00] are gone. Hallelujah. Amen. All of the
[1:44:03] sickness, all of the trouble, all of the
[1:44:06] sorrow, all of the earaches, everything
[1:44:08] is gone. Why? We have prepared for this
[1:44:12] day. Eternal life dwells in us.
[1:44:18] This is not the figment of man's
[1:44:21] imagination. This is reality.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; The breath of life.
[1:44:29] The church of God is born of the breath
[1:44:31] of God.
[1:44:33] Now, I want you to I want you to catch
[1:44:34] that. I'm going to read that to you
[1:44:35] again. Jesus breathing on them. It's
[1:44:38] significant for the Holy Ghost would
[1:44:41] breathe into this new creation. Jesus is
[1:44:45] letting them know, I have purchased. I
[1:44:48] have made a way for this new creation.
[1:44:50] Now, as the father has called me and
[1:44:52] sent me, now I'm calling my my elect and
[1:44:57] I'm sending them. And he breathes upon
[1:45:00] them and says, "Peace be unto you."
[1:45:04] Amen. John John 20 and 22 again when he
[1:45:08] had said this, he breathed on them and
[1:45:11] said unto them, "Receive ye the Holy
[1:45:13] Ghost." Now, I want you to catch this.
[1:45:16] Do y'all remember what God done there in
[1:45:19] to Adam? Genesis 2:7. And the Lord
[1:45:22] formed man out of the dust of the earth
[1:45:24] and breathed into his nostrils the
[1:45:28] breath of life and man become a living
[1:45:31] soul. Hallelujah.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Your spirit did you know spirit in in
[1:45:37] the Hebrew is rrook and it means
[1:45:40] breathe.
[1:45:41] It means life,
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; wind
[1:45:45] in spirit in the Greek comes from the
[1:45:48] word numa and it means breath,
[1:45:53] life,
[1:45:54] wind.
[1:45:58] When God
[1:46:00] in this new creation breathes his life
[1:46:04] in you, it's the same thing that he done
[1:46:06] to Adam at the beginning when he become
[1:46:08] a living soul. God breathe the breath of
[1:46:11] life.
[1:46:13] Hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:46:16] There there in there in John 3 and six,
[1:46:20] it says, "That which is born of the
[1:46:22] flesh is flesh, and that which is born
[1:46:24] of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that
[1:46:26] I said unto thee, you must be born
[1:46:28] again. The wind blows where it lists,
[1:46:33] and thou hearest the sound thereof, but
[1:46:35] thou cannot tell whence it comes and
[1:46:37] whether it goes. So is everyone that is
[1:46:41] born of the spirit.
[1:46:45] You can't see the wind. You can't see
[1:46:49] the the air. Air's blowing through the
[1:46:52] through this through this these uh these
[1:46:55] AC system right now. You can't see the
[1:46:58] air, but you can feel the effects.
[1:47:02] Air's hitting you.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; You can't see the wind.
[1:47:09] But you can see the effects in the
[1:47:10] trees.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying the wind blows. You
[1:47:16] don't know where it comes and you don't
[1:47:17] know what you you you can't you can't
[1:47:19] see, but you can sure tell the effects
[1:47:21] of it.
[1:47:23] And when you're born again, there is
[1:47:26] that life of God that has come in your
[1:47:28] soul.
[1:47:30] There's an effect of it. Your desires
[1:47:33] are his desires.
[1:47:36] Amen. The
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; I tell you what when when that life
[1:47:39] comes in you, the Bible says there in
[1:47:40] Mark uh Mark 16, if you want to put that
[1:47:42] up there, Sister Keith. Amen. Mark Mark
[1:47:44] 16 there, in my name,
[1:47:48] you shall cast out devils.
[1:47:51] In my name, you shall lay hands on the
[1:47:53] sick and they recover.
[1:47:56] In my name, you will speak in new
[1:47:58] tongues. In my name, oh, you're saying
[1:48:02] how how can what what is what has taken
[1:48:04] place? What is different? You still look
[1:48:05] the same, Brother Wendle. There that
[1:48:08] holy wind of God. Yeah. Go and put it
[1:48:10] out there. Amen. These signs shall
[1:48:12] follow them that believe in my name.
[1:48:14] They shall cast out devils. They shall
[1:48:16] speak with new tongues. They shall take
[1:48:18] up serpents. They shall drink deadly
[1:48:20] thing and it shall not hurt them. They
[1:48:22] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:48:25] shall recover. What is it? It's the same
[1:48:27] body. It's the same. You're living in
[1:48:30] the same house. You're living in the
[1:48:32] same house. It's just God has breathed
[1:48:35] his breath into you. He's breathed his
[1:48:38] breath. Now you're a witness unto him.
[1:48:40] You're not a witness unto death. You're
[1:48:42] not a witness unto sin. Now you're a
[1:48:43] witness unto life.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The wind. When God blew this new
[1:48:53] creation, the transformation of the soul
[1:48:55] in the new creation, Jesus breathing on
[1:48:57] them was symbolic. Look, look there in
[1:48:59] Acts two and one. Suddenly there came a
[1:49:02] sound from heaven as if they rushing
[1:49:04] mighty wind and it filled all the house
[1:49:07] where they were sitting and clothe and
[1:49:09] appeared unto them cloven tongues of
[1:49:11] fire and they were filled with the Holy
[1:49:14] Ghost. Can you see amen? What is it?
[1:49:19] There's an exchange. Notice that
[1:49:21] exchange.
[1:49:23] through his death for us.
[1:49:27] His life is made available
[1:49:30] to us
[1:49:33] for his death
[1:49:35] through his death
[1:49:38] through his taking his death taking our
[1:49:42] damnation. Him dying in one version they
[1:49:46] said dying the death.
[1:49:49] the death, not not this death, the
[1:49:53] death, him going to hell for you,
[1:49:59] so that his life
[1:50:02] could breathe
[1:50:03] upon us.
[1:50:06] So his life,
[1:50:08] it's no wonder there in in Galatians 2
[1:50:10] and 20 and I'm reading out of the NIV
[1:50:12] version, I have been crucified with
[1:50:14] Christ and I no longer live,
[1:50:18] but Christ lives in me. The life I now
[1:50:21] live in the body,
[1:50:23] I live by the faith in the Son of God
[1:50:26] who loved me and gave himself for me.
[1:50:30] Now catch this there in 1 Corinthian or
[1:50:32] 2 Corinthians 5 and 21. For he hath made
[1:50:36] him Christ to be sin for us who knew no
[1:50:40] sin that we might be made the
[1:50:45] righteousness of God in him. That's your
[1:50:48] time to shout hallelujah.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:54] Romans 5 and8. But God commendeth his
[1:50:57] love toward us in that while we were yet
[1:51:00] sinners, he died for us.
[1:51:02] Much more than being now justified by
[1:51:06] his blood, we shall be saved from the
[1:51:08] wrath through him. For if when we were
[1:51:13] sinners, we were reconciled to God by
[1:51:17] the death of his son, much more.
[1:51:20] Somebody say much more. Being
[1:51:22] reconciled, we shall be saved by his
[1:51:28] life.
[1:51:33] His life. Can you say amen?
[1:51:36] Oh, glory to God. What is his life?
[1:51:39] That's the same holy. Did you know that
[1:51:42] Jesus had the Holy Ghost just like you
[1:51:43] do?
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The the Bible says
[1:51:51] there in Acts 10 and and uh uh uh uh 38
[1:51:56] how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[1:51:59] the Holy Ghost and with power and he
[1:52:02] went around doing good and healing all
[1:52:04] that were oppressed of the devil for God
[1:52:06] was with him. St. John 1 and4 in him was
[1:52:10] life and the life was the light of men.
[1:52:18] So as I wind down now,
[1:52:22] life
[1:52:24] life is not a religious affair.
[1:52:31] And this is where I I have I I I I sort
[1:52:35] of have problems a little bit with
[1:52:37] mixing tradition with Christ, any kind
[1:52:40] of tradition with Christ,
[1:52:43] because we don't want we we we don't we
[1:52:46] we we we don't want
[1:52:49] the gospel
[1:52:52] being mixed with anything.
[1:52:57] You see, that's what they were doing
[1:52:58] there in Paul's day.
[1:53:00] They were taking they were taking the
[1:53:03] old
[1:53:05] uh the the old Jewish traditions and
[1:53:09] mixing it in with the Christian worship.
[1:53:12] And the Apostle Paul was coming in and
[1:53:14] saying, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. How
[1:53:18] is it you began in the spirit?" Spirit,
[1:53:23] breath, life, wind. How is it you you
[1:53:26] began in the spirit and now you're doing
[1:53:30] all of these carnal things?
[1:53:34] There's no life in these carnal things.
[1:53:39] There's nothing there. All you're you're
[1:53:41] putting your hope and people are putting
[1:53:43] their hope in these things.
[1:53:48] There's only one way for life and that
[1:53:52] is through that great amoya. That's the
[1:53:55] great Holy Spirit to come and breathe
[1:53:58] upon you.
[1:54:03] That's what God's wanting. It ain't an
[1:54:06] eagle feather with cedar. It ain't a It
[1:54:09] ain't none of that kind of stuff. Well,
[1:54:11] you got to you got to find it's where
[1:54:13] the Holy Spirit is.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit coming upon us. Can you
[1:54:21] say amen? The Apostle Paul says, "It's
[1:54:24] not in the washing of hands.
[1:54:26] You're you're going through the rituals
[1:54:28] of what you used to do." As if that has
[1:54:31] anything to do.
[1:54:36] The Apostle Paul says, "I I was the top.
[1:54:40] I was the top in my religion." He said,
[1:54:43] "I was at the top,
[1:54:48] but I have counted it all done
[1:54:52] that I may win the life of Christ.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; I count all." It's in it's there in the
[1:55:01] Bible. He he he he goes through it in
[1:55:03] several places. He does it there in
[1:55:05] Corinthians. He also does it in
[1:55:06] Galatians. He he devotes entire chapters
[1:55:09] to this because he he was one of those
[1:55:12] guys. But he says, "I've had to
[1:55:16] I've had to count that all." And then
[1:55:19] what did he say there in the book of
[1:55:20] Philippians? I I love this. I'm going to
[1:55:23] read that to you as we close now.
[1:55:26] Hallelujah.
[1:55:29] Philippians
[1:55:31] the uh third
[1:55:35] third chapter.
[1:55:38] Amen.
[1:55:40] He says now three and three and four or
[1:55:44] three and one he says finding my
[1:55:45] brethren rejoice in the Lord to write
[1:55:49] the same things to you to me indeed is
[1:55:51] not grievious but for you it is safe.
[1:55:54] Beware of dogs. Beware of evil workers.
[1:55:56] Beware of concision. Beware, for we are
[1:56:01] for we are the circumcision, which
[1:56:03] worship God in the spirit, and rejoice
[1:56:05] in Jesus Christ, and has no confidence
[1:56:07] in the flesh. For though I might have
[1:56:09] confidence in the flesh, if any other
[1:56:12] man thinkketh that he hath whereof that
[1:56:14] he might trust in the flesh, I more. I
[1:56:16] was circumcised the eighth day, of the
[1:56:18] stock of Israel, of the tribe of
[1:56:20] Benjamin, and Hebrew of Hebrews, as
[1:56:22] touching the law of Pharisee. Concerning
[1:56:24] zeal, persecuting the church, touching
[1:56:26] the righteousness which is in the law, I
[1:56:28] was blameless. But those things which
[1:56:31] were gained to me, those I count loss
[1:56:34] for Christ. Yay, doubtless I count all
[1:56:37] things but loss for the excellency of
[1:56:40] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,
[1:56:43] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:56:46] things, and do count them but dung that
[1:56:48] I may win Christ if and be found in him,
[1:56:51] not having my own righteousness, which
[1:56:54] is of the law, but that which is through
[1:56:56] the faith of Christ, the righteousness
[1:56:58] which is of God by faith, that I may
[1:57:01] know him and the power of his
[1:57:04] resurrection. ction and the fellowship
[1:57:06] of his sufferings and being made
[1:57:08] conformable unto his death. If by any
[1:57:11] means I may attain the resurrection of
[1:57:12] the dead, not as though I've already
[1:57:14] attained or either were already perfect,
[1:57:17] but I follow after if that I may
[1:57:19] apprehend or arrest that for which I
[1:57:22] have been arrested of Christ Jesus.
[1:57:24] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[1:57:27] arrested it already, apprehended it. But
[1:57:30] this one thing I do, forgetting those
[1:57:33] things which are behind, and reaching
[1:57:35] forth under those things which are
[1:57:36] before, I press. Somebody say, I press.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; I press
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; toward the mark for the prize of the
[1:57:43] high calling in Christ Jesus. Let us
[1:57:47] therefore, as many be perfect, be thus
[1:57:48] minded. If any man think any uh any
[1:57:51] other mind, God will reveal this to you.
[1:57:55] Can you say amen?
[1:57:57] So what is that telling me? I had
[1:57:59] tradition. I had the tradition of the
[1:58:02] Pentecostal faith. I had I had I had to
[1:58:07] leave it behind.
[1:58:12] I had to leave those things behind
[1:58:15] in order to come and walk with Christ
[1:58:19] because his spirit,
[1:58:22] his spirit spoken word is leading me. I
[1:58:25] cannot remain in the same place that I
[1:58:28] was.
[1:58:29] He's leading me.
[1:58:32] It's not a set place. In the Old
[1:58:34] Testament, the Israel when they come out
[1:58:37] of Egypt, they had to follow that pillar
[1:58:39] of fire. Whenever that pillar of fire
[1:58:40] moved, it was the spirit, the breath of
[1:58:43] God. It was the it was the great logos
[1:58:46] of God. Amen. It it it was the word. It
[1:58:49] was the that pillar of fire.
[1:58:52] Every time it moved, they had to move
[1:58:54] with it.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And I had to do it.
[1:59:00] And oh, how hard it was for me.
[1:59:05] Oh, how hard as I was looking at all of
[1:59:08] these things and I seen it in the
[1:59:10] scripture and I and I be to I said, "Oh,
[1:59:14] I've got to leave it behind."
[1:59:19] Slowly, God began to take these things
[1:59:21] from me. It was his breath. It was God
[1:59:25] leading me. You know what he was doing?
[1:59:28] He was cutting all of the things that
[1:59:29] were keeping me bound. He was cutting it
[1:59:32] loose. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:36] Hallelujah. God gave me a dream. I was I
[1:59:40] was whenever God was trying to deal with
[1:59:41] me. Come on, you got to come out. Sister
[1:59:43] Carol will remember. Amen. And and and I
[1:59:48] I I was
[1:59:51] you know,
[1:59:53] the Lord just began to deal with me
[1:59:55] saying, "I I'm not pleased with you. I'm
[1:59:58] not pleased with you." And here I was,
[2:00:01] you know, man, we had a hot band.
[2:00:06] And uh we had we had we had good
[2:00:10] musicians. We had we had good singers.
[2:00:13] We had I mean I was I was I was doing
[2:00:17] everything for the Lord. I was I was
[2:00:18] even putting I was putting ads in papers
[2:00:21] and I I mean I was I was I we I listen
[2:00:23] we were
[2:00:25] we were working hard.
[2:00:28] uh uh we I mean
[2:00:33] for the Lord and yet
[2:00:37] I was putting emphasis on things that
[2:00:40] was not pertaining to his word
[2:00:44] and and I and and I remember having a
[2:00:47] dream and in this dream
[2:00:51] it was it was a two-part dream. It was I
[2:00:55] had it one night and then it the next
[2:00:57] night and I and and without just going
[2:00:59] all the into the details, I I seen the
[2:01:03] church full and and and uh we were
[2:01:07] working, as I say, we were working hard
[2:01:08] with the alcoholics and the and the drug
[2:01:10] addicts and just really working hard and
[2:01:13] and but I I seen the church. I was
[2:01:15] trying to start it and I I was trying to
[2:01:16] get up and start the church and everyone
[2:01:18] was all visiting and and the people were
[2:01:20] fighting over chairs and this that and
[2:01:22] the other in the dream and I and I'm
[2:01:24] sitting there trying to preach and we
[2:01:25] couldn't and and and and
[2:01:29] the presence of the Lord just something
[2:01:32] spoke and said, "Is this the kind
[2:01:36] of work you want to do for me?"
[2:01:39] In other words, you're bringing
[2:01:40] confusion
[2:01:46] And I I I sat there and I
[2:01:51] and and it was like there was a spirit.
[2:01:53] The Lord was showing me that I am being
[2:01:55] controlled by something.
[2:01:57] Well,
[2:02:02] I I I woke up that next I woke up out of
[2:02:04] after this, you know, that morning and
[2:02:07] man, I didn't even go to work. I called
[2:02:10] in. And I said, "Man, this I was so
[2:02:13] deprived." I mean, it was that dream got
[2:02:14] to me. It was bad. And then and then the
[2:02:17] next night, that next day, I was praying
[2:02:19] and just crying out to God. The next
[2:02:20] night, the dream started all over again.
[2:02:25] And then
[2:02:28] it was I I was I was in this dream and I
[2:02:31] was I was in this wilderness. I was a
[2:02:33] confusion
[2:02:35] and
[2:02:37] and there was uh you know I I I but I
[2:02:40] was looking for something and I couldn't
[2:02:42] find it and I was looking and then I was
[2:02:44] going up and down and trying to find
[2:02:46] where I was where I was going and then I
[2:02:48] was told you've missed it. You you
[2:02:49] you've got it's it's the it's the small
[2:02:52] trail and I and I so I went down there
[2:02:54] and and and there was still the woods
[2:02:56] all around me. But I came around and
[2:02:57] there was this and and in the woods I I
[2:03:00] I I found some music, some old music.
[2:03:03] And man, drums halfway broke, guitar
[2:03:07] strings busted. There was music on and I
[2:03:10] and and me being a musician, I'm I'm
[2:03:13] over there and I'm I'm trying to fix the
[2:03:15] strings and and trying to fix this and
[2:03:18] trying to do this and and and get the
[2:03:20] piano to going and and I and and and
[2:03:23] there was a man that appeared to me and
[2:03:25] said, "You got to leave this behind and
[2:03:27] you got to go on."
[2:03:29] And I I just kept on working and and the
[2:03:32] man says, "You've got to leave this
[2:03:35] behind."
[2:03:36] And I I followed then I went over the
[2:03:38] guitar and I was trying and I and
[2:03:41] finally there was and then he got stern.
[2:03:43] I said, "You've got to leave it behind."
[2:03:48] I turn around and there's where I seen
[2:03:51] that prophet.
[2:03:55] He said, "I'll lead you
[2:03:58] if you'll follow."
[2:04:03] So reluctantly, I left it behind and we
[2:04:05] came across and there was this there was
[2:04:06] this great great oasis and this and this
[2:04:09] and and and there were it was just
[2:04:11] beautiful out came out of the wilderness
[2:04:14] and he said, "Do you want me to teach
[2:04:15] you how to fish?" And I
[2:04:20] I said, "Yes, sir. I would I'd like to
[2:04:21] learn to fish."
[2:04:25] And you know, others were out there. I
[2:04:27] don't know. He threw something out and
[2:04:30] out there like in a box and and just
[2:04:32] jumping into it and and and and as he's
[2:04:36] pulling it in, I I'm I'm weeping and he
[2:04:39] turns around to me and he says, "If you
[2:04:43] will be sincere,
[2:04:46] you will teach my people."
[2:04:52] Well, then I woke up and I my pillow's
[2:04:54] all wet and I I I and and and there
[2:04:58] there was a little glow at the foot of
[2:04:59] the bed. Now, that might not mean much
[2:05:02] to you, but it meant a whole lot to me
[2:05:05] because God was already teaching me. He
[2:05:08] was showing me, you've got to leave the
[2:05:11] traditions that you were raised in.
[2:05:14] You've got to leave those things behind.
[2:05:17] You've got you've got to come further
[2:05:19] up, you've got in order to walk with me.
[2:05:23] That doesn't mean that I couldn't play
[2:05:25] music anymore. It doesn't mean and and
[2:05:27] and we're not we're not we're not saying
[2:05:29] that that you that that that you don't,
[2:05:31] you know, but there there's there's good
[2:05:34] in all things,
[2:05:37] but there is a limit. We have got to
[2:05:39] watch what we are and and and what
[2:05:42] spirit is is motivating the thing. I
[2:05:46] could never go back and put the emphasis
[2:05:49] on music like it once was. And buddy, at
[2:05:55] one time I thought I was a good
[2:05:57] musician. I don't play anymore, so it's
[2:06:00] hard. Amen. But at one time we could
[2:06:04] listen, we had a good band. Amen. We
[2:06:07] did. Hallelujah.
[2:06:10] But you see, well, we still have a good
[2:06:12] band, but I'm saying even back then, we
[2:06:14] we were doing it for a little bit
[2:06:15] different, a little bit different
[2:06:17] purpose back then.
[2:06:20] We were using the music to attract
[2:06:23] and it wasn't the word to attract. Y'all
[2:06:25] understand what I'm saying? And the
[2:06:27] spirit of the Lord would begin to deal
[2:06:30] with me
[2:06:32] in order for me to fulfill
[2:06:37] the purpose. I've got to follow that
[2:06:40] breath of life. And I just want to say
[2:06:42] this this morning in closing and thank
[2:06:43] you for your patience today.
[2:06:48] Every one of you have been saved for a
[2:06:51] purpose.
[2:06:53] Jesus, I want you to put yourself where
[2:06:55] those disciples are at right now. Where
[2:06:58] those disciples, what Jesus had raised
[2:06:59] from the dead, they thought that they
[2:07:01] thought it was all over. He's raised.
[2:07:03] He's showing himself to them. He's now
[2:07:06] breathing and saying, "Now,
[2:07:09] as I have been sent for a purpose to
[2:07:11] redeem you,
[2:07:18] receive you the Holy Ghost, for you will
[2:07:20] be a witness unto me.
[2:07:26] Not my will, but thy will be done."
[2:07:29] Do I make sense?
[2:07:32] You're not going to do what you want.
[2:07:34] You've got to do what he wants.
[2:07:39] God has called you for a higher purpose,
[2:07:43] a deeper calling.
[2:07:46] Hallelujah. He calls us when we are at
[2:07:49] our He He allows us to get to the
[2:07:53] bottom. Every one of us. He allows us to
[2:07:55] get to our bottom so that we have
[2:07:58] nothing to give. so that he he
[2:08:04] can use us.
[2:08:06] He allows us to get to the point where
[2:08:09] our backs against the wall so that he
[2:08:12] when you think I am no good to you,
[2:08:13] Lord, I'm no good. There's no my backs.
[2:08:16] What What can I have to offer?
[2:08:19] A surrendered will is all he's looking
[2:08:21] for. A surrendered heart that says, "I
[2:08:23] have nothing." God says,
[2:08:28] "I'll use you now."
[2:08:32] When all hope is gone,
[2:08:35] when everything then you hear the
[2:08:46] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:51] I believe the wind still blows. I
[2:08:52] believe the breath of God still blows
[2:08:53] today. You say, "Well, I'm I'm too old."
[2:08:56] No, no. Moses was 80.
[2:09:02] Well, praise the Lord.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:06] Amen. God knows what he's doing in you
[2:09:09] and God can still and that. But just I
[2:09:11] don't care if you're at home and it
[2:09:12] seems like you're you're sort of stoled
[2:09:14] up. Just just just remember the breath
[2:09:16] of God is on the inside of you. Just
[2:09:19] remember, God just
[2:09:21] blows upon you and he can use you in
[2:09:24] prayer. He can use you on many mighty
[2:09:26] things. If the musicians would come,
[2:09:33] receive ye the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:38] See how the Holy Ghost is important.
[2:09:43] Flow through me, Lord.
[2:09:45] Flow through me.
[2:09:48] Oh my.
[2:09:50] Did you know the Bible says that when
[2:09:52] they came out of that upper room, when
[2:09:53] they were filled with the Holy Ghost,
[2:09:54] the Bible says, "And the apostles gave
[2:09:57] great witness to the resurrection with
[2:10:00] signs and wonders following."
[2:10:03] Read the book of Acts. The book of Acts.
[2:10:05] Now the the the there Matthew, Mark,
[2:10:08] Luke, John is the four gospels talking
[2:10:11] about Jesus.
[2:10:13] But then the book of acts after the Holy
[2:10:17] Spirit has breathed upon them. Read the
[2:10:20] book of acts. This is the works that God
[2:10:22] was doing through the redeemed.
[2:10:28] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, the four
[2:10:29] gospels. They was the works that God was
[2:10:32] doing through the redeemer, the perfect
[2:10:34] son of God.
[2:10:36] Acts is the works of the Holy Spirit
[2:10:40] done to the redeemed.
[2:10:44] those who were lost and fallen, but God
[2:10:46] gave life to and now they are performing
[2:10:50] his works.
[2:10:53] I don't know if this message has meant
[2:10:55] as much to you as it has to me, but I
[2:10:57] tell you what, I' I I I I I've been
[2:11:00] struggling a little bit with that with
[2:11:01] my ear, but uh uh you know, this week
[2:11:04] and uh but as I was as I was just
[2:11:06] thinking along these thoughts, the
[2:11:08] breath of God, the life of God, the Oh
[2:11:12] my I thought, "Oh, God, here I am.
[2:11:15] Amen." Uh uh uh. Oh, man. That that that
[2:11:20] that that was a rough earache, man. That
[2:11:22] was a rough earache. And uh uh you know,
[2:11:25] and I I I but I'm saying, "Oh, but in
[2:11:29] this old body is a living breath.
[2:11:37] In your old body, mama, in your body,
[2:11:39] you get weary and tired, but in that
[2:11:41] body is the breath of God, the life of
[2:11:44] God."
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Well, glory. That make you want to
[2:11:48] shout?
[2:11:51] You don't get this. You don't You don't
[2:11:52] get this by joining a church. You get
[2:11:54] this
[2:11:57] by God coming
[2:11:59] [Music]
[2:12:02] today.
[2:12:04] Do you need a fresh breath of God? You
[2:12:06] say, "Can I get I I received the Holy
[2:12:08] Ghost 20 years ago." The Bible says in
[2:12:10] in the fourth chapter
[2:12:14] that they were also needing the breath
[2:12:15] of God again. and they were going
[2:12:17] through the trials and the tribulations
[2:12:19] the Acts Acts 4 that the you know there
[2:12:23] there would there was a man that was
[2:12:25] healed and now they're being persecuted
[2:12:27] and and uh and it was the Bible says
[2:12:30] that you know they seen where they had
[2:12:33] uh took knowledge that they had been
[2:12:34] with Jesus and beholding the man that
[2:12:36] was healed they could say nothing
[2:12:37] against it and and now they're beating
[2:12:40] them and they're they're doing these
[2:12:42] things and and and and and they're
[2:12:45] praying the the the the disciples are
[2:12:48] praying and I'm just breaking in here
[2:12:49] but uh Acts 4 and 29.
[2:12:54] And now Lord, behold their threatenings
[2:12:56] and grant unto thy servants that with
[2:12:59] all boldness they may speak thy word by
[2:13:01] stretching forth thine hand to heal and
[2:13:04] that signs and wonders may be done by
[2:13:06] the name of thy holy child Jesus. And
[2:13:08] when they had played prayed, the place
[2:13:11] was shaken where they were assembled and
[2:13:13] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:13:17] and spake the word of God with boldness.
[2:13:19] They were refilled.
[2:13:22] So I say one filling and many refillings
[2:13:26] breathing. Praise the Lord.
[2:13:30] Hallelujah.
[2:13:32] Amen.

[2:15:26] Is there someone here
[2:15:30] that maybe you're not living yet?
[2:15:33] You're alive to sin and death to
[2:15:35] righteousness.
[2:15:38] Why don't you let God breathe upon your
[2:15:40] soul?
[2:15:43] You'll breathe it unto eternal life. The
[2:15:45] Bible says when you receive the Holy
[2:15:47] Ghost, you receive it.

[2:15:52] redemption.
