[27:31] and lifted me
[27:34] from sorrow
[27:37] and shame.
[27:40] But tonight, Lord,
[27:42] just let
[27:45] me fall.
[27:47] [Music]
[27:50] Let me fall
[27:54] in love with you
[27:57] all over
[27:59] again.
[28:02] Let me know you
[28:05] as never
[28:08] before.
[28:13] Let me hear
[28:16] your tender voice.
[28:19] say
[28:21] to me,
[28:24] "Won't you willingly
[28:27] [Music]
[28:28] hope
[28:30] the door
[28:32] [Music]
[28:36] I've walked through
[28:38] the winter,
[28:41] faced death's coldest
[28:44] steam,
[28:46] &gt;&gt; then the springtime time
[28:49] brought strength to stand tall.
[28:54] [Music]
[28:57] But it's been too long
[29:00] the summer
[29:03] without any
[29:06] rain.
[29:08] So what's left Lord but to have a
[29:14] great fall.
[29:19] Let me fall
[29:22] in love with you
[29:25] all over
[29:28] again.
[29:30] Let me know you
[29:33] as never
[29:36] before. Lord,
[29:38] [Music]
[29:41] let me hear
[29:44] your tender voice,
[29:47] sir
[29:50] to me.
[29:52] Won't you willingly
[29:56] open
[29:58] the door? Let's sing that second verse
[30:01] again.
[30:03] I've walked through
[30:06] the winter,
[30:09] faced death cold,
[30:14] then the springtime
[30:17] brought strength to
[30:21] stand tall.
[30:24] But it's been too long
[30:28] a summer
[30:30] without any
[30:33] rain.
[30:36] So what's left, Lord,
[30:39] but to have a great fall?
[30:44] [Music]
[30:46] Let me fall
[30:49] in love with you
[30:53] all over again.
[30:57] Let me know you
[31:00] as never
[31:03] before.
[31:07] Let me hear
[31:10] your tender voice
[31:14] say
[31:16] me.
[31:20] Won't you willingly
[31:22] open
[31:24] the door
[31:28] today? I will leanly
[31:33] open
[31:35] the door. Someone needs to say that
[31:38] today.
[31:40] Oh Lord, I will
[31:44] open
[31:46] the door.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you praise him this morning?
[31:57] How many's glad there's an open door
[32:03] &gt;&gt; that no man can shut?
[32:08] &gt;&gt; And if God shuts the door, and he will
[32:13] one day,
[32:16] no man can open it.
[32:19] [Music]
[32:20] As we stand together,
[32:24] we have an opportunity to open the door
[32:29] because
[32:31] said I knock at the door. If any man
[32:34] here and listen and open the door, I'll
[32:38] come in to him and sub with him
[32:42] and I so to know him.
[32:45] Amen. Like like the brother just sung.
[32:49] Amen. And how many wants to know him?
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Like Paul said, I believe in the power
[32:53] of his resurrection.
[32:56] Amen.
[32:58] Well, today he's our lawyer pleading our
[33:01] case.
[33:04] Don't wait till he becomes the judge.
[33:10] I want to know him today.
[33:13] Amen.
[33:14] as we get ready to turn it to our
[33:16] pastor. Just one other song on my heart
[33:19] this morning. Amen. If you'll help me
[33:22] sing it in G. Amen. The haven of rest.
[33:28] Oh, I've anored
[33:31] [Music]
[33:32] my soul
[33:35] in the haven
[33:39] of rest.
[33:41] Oh, I'll set
[33:44] the white seas
[33:47] no more.
[33:49] [Music]
[33:53] The tempest
[33:56] may sweep
[33:58] or the wild
[34:02] deep,
[34:04] but in Jesus
[34:07] I'm safe. I want to sing that second
[34:10] verse this morning. I yielded myself.
[34:15] Well, I yielded
[34:19] myself
[34:21] to his tender
[34:24] embrace
[34:27] and faith,
[34:30] taking hold of the word.
[34:38] Well, my feathers
[34:41] they fell off
[34:43] when I anored
[34:47] my soul.
[34:49] For the haven
[34:52] of rest
[34:55] is my Lord.
[35:00] Oh my
[35:02] [Applause]
[35:03] go
[35:10] [Music]
[35:12] [Applause]
[35:14] [Music]
[35:24] the tempest
[35:26] may sweet
[35:29] on The wild
[35:32] storm.
[35:33] Oh, in Jesus
[35:35] [Music]
[35:37] th
[35:42] Oh, can we just sing it again? Aren't
[35:44] you glad for that? I have anored
[35:48] my soul
[35:51] in the haven. I'm so thankful for Jesus.
[35:56] I'm so thankful.
[35:59] Hallelujah.
[36:01] Hallelujah.
[36:03] [Music]
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[36:07] Oh, though the tempest
[36:11] may sweep
[36:14] all the
[36:16] stormy be.
[36:19] yet in Jesus
[36:21] [Music]
[36:23] save ever
[36:26] more.
[36:30] Hallelujah.
[36:32] There's such a sweetness of his rest.
[36:36] And friends, while the presence of the
[36:38] Lord is here this morning,
[36:40] you don't have to wait for an altar
[36:42] call. It's just the surrender of heart
[36:44] that says, "Lord, I'm going to give it
[36:46] all to you right now."
[36:48] The magic is not a preacher's hand laid
[36:50] on you. The magic is not a certain place
[36:53] where you kneel down. The magic is the
[36:55] surrender of heart that says, "I need
[36:58] you, Lord." And that can happen. That
[37:01] can happen right there where you are.
[37:03] Miracles can take place right there in
[37:06] those pews where you sat this morning.
[37:09] There is nothing impossible with God.
[37:13] Amen.
[37:14] And while his presence is here, we've
[37:16] got a special treat for you. Brother
[37:17] Josh Martin is going to be ministering
[37:20] this morning. I believe he's anointed of
[37:23] the Holy Spirit for the for for this
[37:26] morning. Amen. And he's going to bring
[37:30] bring the word of the Lord. And I want
[37:33] to tell you, it doesn't matter. It
[37:36] doesn't matter the need that you have.
[37:38] I'm a needy person. I need the Lord.
[37:41] I woke up this morning,
[37:44] amen, as I was kneeling in in prayer and
[37:48] or or or laying there in the bed
[37:50] actually, just laying there and say,
[37:52] "Lord, I need you today.
[37:54] I need your presence. I I need you to
[37:57] speak to my heart this morning." How
[38:00] about you? Do you do you have something
[38:01] that you need from the Lord here this
[38:03] morning? So wonderful to see so many of
[38:06] our friends here today. And um brother
[38:09] Merrl has already greeted you and and we
[38:12] just say God richly bless you. Good to
[38:14] see all of you.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But most importantly here this
[38:19] morning.
[38:21] One human can't help another human.
[38:26] One human we're we're all human and we
[38:28] can hurt one another and sometimes we
[38:31] don't mean to hurt one another. We we're
[38:35] all faulty.
[38:37] But there's one among us. That's the
[38:39] Lord Jesus Christ who will never fail
[38:42] us.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; I can fail you. I can fail my wife. She
[38:47] can fail me. I can fail you as a friend
[38:49] or even a pastor. You can fail me as a
[38:52] friend.
[38:54] But Jesus will never fail us. He will
[38:57] never fail us here this morning. So as
[39:00] we sing this song and invite the man of
[39:02] God to come, I want you to take the lid
[39:04] off of your heart. Open that heart's
[39:07] door and say, "Lord, here I am. I'm I'm
[39:10] going to open myself up wide open this
[39:13] morning for your spirit to meet my
[39:15] need."
[39:16] Amen.
[39:18] Though the tempest
[39:22] may sweep
[39:25] or the wild
[39:27] stormy may.
[39:30] Yes. In Jesus
[39:33] I'm save
[39:35] [Applause]
[39:37] more.
[39:41] Oh, I think
[39:44] anored my soul
[39:48] in the haven. Hallelujah.
[39:52] Oh,
[39:54] I'll save
[39:56] those wild seas
[39:59] no more.
[40:05] [Music]
[40:17] Jesus,
[40:19] I'm saved. faith ever more. Can we sing
[40:23] that one more time? I've anchored my
[40:26] soul.
[40:28] I've anored
[40:30] my soul.
[40:34] [Music]
[40:35] [Applause]
[40:38] [Music]
[40:39] [Applause]
[40:40] I feel
[40:42] [Music]
[40:45] &gt;&gt; no more.
[40:57] Wow.
[41:01] Hallelujah.
[41:03] Jesus,
[41:05] I'm safe ever more.
[41:12] Amen. I'm sure that's your confession
[41:14] this morning.
[41:16] I've anchored my soul in the haven of
[41:19] rest. And it's in assuring to know that
[41:23] we have an anchor that we can anchor our
[41:25] soul to. Not just something that we we
[41:28] hope so. You know, this message ain't a
[41:31] hope so. It's a no.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would tell us that hope
[41:35] pushes it out in the future. Hoping I
[41:37] can obtain, hoping I can get it. But he
[41:39] says, "Faith claims it right now." So,
[41:41] we're not hoping that we have a an
[41:44] anchor of the soul. We're claiming an
[41:46] anchor of the soul, and it's claimed us.
[41:48] And I believe we've all been through
[41:50] some hard times and rough seas, but
[41:52] we're still standing today because of
[41:54] the anchor that has anchored our soul.
[41:57] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[41:58] Lord this morning?
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, it's good to be with y'all
[42:02] here today. If you would have your
[42:04] Bibles, I've got two passages of
[42:06] scripture. 1 Peter 1:1.
[42:09] Let me read that down to the second
[42:10] verse in Galatians 3 and 28. While y'all
[42:15] are turning there, I would like to say
[42:17] thank you for all the the food and the
[42:20] prayers and everything that uh we've had
[42:23] our our newborn little Olly there, Lucas
[42:25] Oliver. Uh he was supposed to been his
[42:28] due date was today, but he he came
[42:30] early. there were some things that uh
[42:32] was concerning to the doctor. So, he
[42:34] wanted to to get the baby here a little
[42:36] early. So, we're thankful that the Lord
[42:38] kept his hands upon the baby and mama.
[42:41] They're home today and so they're
[42:42] they're doing good. Uh well, baby's
[42:45] doing good. Mama didn't get much sleep
[42:47] last night, but but uh the baby's doing
[42:50] great and everything. So, we're thank
[42:52] the Lord for for his hands of mercy. But
[42:55] first Peter 1 and1
[42:57] Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the
[43:00] strangers scattered throughout Pontius,
[43:03] Galatia, uh, Capidosia, Asia, and
[43:06] Bethania, elect according to the
[43:09] fornowledge of God the Father through
[43:12] the sanctification of the spirit unto
[43:14] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[43:16] Jesus Christ, grace unto you and peace
[43:20] be multiplied. and Galatians 3 and 3 and
[43:24] 28.
[43:27] There is neither Jew nor Greek. There is
[43:29] neither bond nor free. There is neither
[43:31] male nor female. For ye are all one in
[43:34] Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christs, then
[43:37] you're Abraham's seed and hes according
[43:40] to the promise. Amen. Can we bow our
[43:42] heads this morning? Dear gracious
[43:44] heavenly father, Lord, how thankful we
[43:47] are for your mercies and your grace.
[43:50] Lord, the presence that we feel here
[43:52] this morning, God, I believe all things
[43:54] are possible, Lord, not only to you, but
[43:56] to us, Lord, if we can just believe,
[43:59] God, our I believe our our prayers can
[44:01] be answered, Lord. But God, as your
[44:03] spirit is here so sweet among us,
[44:05] Father, we ask that you would just have
[44:07] preeminence in this service, Lord. You
[44:10] know the needs that are in the the lives
[44:12] of your people, the hearts of your
[44:13] children. We ask Lord that you would
[44:16] just have the right away here among us
[44:18] God and speak to the needs and to the
[44:20] hearts God. Anoint our hearts to receive
[44:23] the word as it would come forth. Father
[44:25] we ask that you would just be pleased in
[44:27] everything that is said undone today in
[44:29] Jesus' name. Amen. You may be seated
[44:33] here tonight. I have a just a a simple
[44:37] thought and it's a strange title but it
[44:39] would be elected strangers. And I had
[44:42] been been going through first Peter and
[44:45] I and as I read those first couple of
[44:47] verses I that really stood out to me.
[44:50] And so here here Peter is addressing
[44:52] this to the strangers that is scattered
[44:55] in these places in these cities that is
[44:58] that is that is there and in Palestine.
[45:00] And and when you look up the word
[45:02] stranger, it's always connected with a a
[45:05] pilgrim or or a souljourer. And the
[45:08] Bible would always liken the children of
[45:10] Israel unto pilgrims. And even in the
[45:14] New Testament, you can look at Hebrews
[45:15] 11:13. These all died in faith, not
[45:19] having received the promises, but having
[45:21] seen them a far off, but were persuaded
[45:24] of them and embraced them and confessed
[45:27] that they were strangers and pilgrims
[45:30] upon the earth. And brother Brandham, he
[45:32] would tell us what a pilgrim is. He
[45:34] would he would say a little something
[45:36] you might look at in the scriptures.
[45:38] Those who sought this new city acted
[45:40] different. They professed that they were
[45:42] pilgrims and strangers, but on the side
[45:44] of Cain, they become fugitives and
[45:47] renegades. But Christians are pilgrims
[45:49] and strangers. A fugitive has no home. A
[45:52] renegade is a horrible person. But a
[45:56] pilgrim is something real from a real
[45:58] land in another nation trying to find
[46:01] his way home. professing by his living
[46:05] that he is something that he's from
[46:07] another country. And as I came across
[46:09] that quote, I I really like how brother
[46:12] Brandham puts it. Professing by his
[46:14] living. And so a uh a a pilgrim ain't
[46:17] just proclaiming by a lip service or a
[46:20] word that he's a pilgrim, but his
[46:23] actions is proving that I don't belong
[46:25] here. I'm just passing through. I'm
[46:28] looking for something that is a far off.
[46:30] But the more I walk, the closer I'm
[46:33] getting to it. And brother Brandham
[46:35] says, "You have something when you are a
[46:37] pilgrim." And so there's a difference
[46:39] between a pilgrim and a stranger and a
[46:42] fugitive and a vagabond. As brother
[46:44] Brandham would tell us, that was Cain's
[46:46] people. That was the serpent seed. And
[46:48] here uh uh you can look out at that that
[46:51] the the vagabonds and the the fugitives,
[46:54] they're wandering to and fro without no
[46:56] direction. And you can look in the in
[46:58] the Strong's concordance there. The
[47:01] definition of that vagabond and fugitive
[47:04] is is somebody that's that's a totter.
[47:06] He's shaken. He's staggering. He's
[47:08] wandering, moving, tossed about, tossed
[47:11] about, to shake, caused to totter and to
[47:14] disturb. And so a vagabond and a
[47:16] fugitive is somebody that has no strong
[47:19] direction. It's somebody that that that
[47:21] that is blown by every wind of doctrine,
[47:24] blown by everything that comes by his
[47:26] way. But there's a difference between
[47:28] the Cain's children and the children of
[47:31] God because they have a direction. Cuz
[47:33] many times when you think of a pilgrim,
[47:36] you think of somebody that don't have a
[47:38] direction or or a stranger that got no
[47:40] direction. They're just wondering.
[47:42] That's not the case because a pilgrim
[47:44] has more of a direction sometimes than
[47:46] the locals do because the locals it's
[47:49] easy to become satisfied with where you
[47:52] are at. You easy belieism. you know, you
[47:55] you're satisfied in your home. You're
[47:57] you're you got a good job. And it's easy
[47:59] to lose the direction or the focus that
[48:02] you're trying to obtain. But a pilgrim,
[48:05] all he has is his direction. He don't
[48:08] have nothing to offer, nothing to his
[48:09] name. Nothing he can point back to and
[48:12] say, "I've got this. I've got that." But
[48:13] a pilgrim, the only thing he can point
[48:16] to is what he is striving for. And I
[48:19] believe that's the way it is with the
[48:21] bride of Christ. We might not have much
[48:23] to offer as a worldly standard, but we
[48:26] have one thing that is a spiritual
[48:29] ambition. I'm striving for one thing,
[48:32] and that is the kingdom of God. And
[48:35] that's why I left Jeremiah 29 and 11 so
[48:39] much. I know the thoughts that I have
[48:41] towards you, the thoughts of peace and
[48:43] not of evil to give you an expected end.
[48:47] So our end is an expected end. It's you
[48:51] see and if you look at Kate's children,
[48:53] they have no direction and they have no
[48:55] expectation. They don't have something
[48:57] they're striving for. They don't have an
[49:00] expected end. They have an end, but it's
[49:02] not an expected end. But the thoughts I
[49:05] have towards you is to give you an
[49:08] expected end where we're not just tossed
[49:11] to and fro, blind leading the blind, but
[49:13] there's an expectation that we are
[49:16] striving for. And I believe that this
[49:18] expectation ain't just something like a,
[49:21] you know, you trying to lead a horse or
[49:23] you put an apple in front of it. This
[49:25] ain't something just to lead you on, but
[49:28] it's something we can obtain that if we
[49:30] keep pressing on all the promises of God
[49:34] can be given to us. You believe that
[49:37] this morning? Because the devil wants to
[49:39] make you feel like you are a fugitive
[49:42] and a vagabond where you have no future
[49:44] outside of this world. where you have no
[49:46] direction outside of a of a good career
[49:49] or if you're not making a bunch of money
[49:51] and you don't have a future. You see,
[49:54] that's not the case with the bride of
[49:56] Christ. We we're trying to make a living
[49:58] here. You got to do the best you can for
[50:00] your families, for your children, but
[50:03] that is not our ambition. Our ambition
[50:06] is to make sure what God has called me
[50:09] to do, that's what I am going to
[50:11] produce. You see, we've got a spiritual
[50:14] ambition that God has given us. And I
[50:16] know I talked about ambition some time
[50:19] ago. So, I hope it's okay if I hit some
[50:21] of these things again this morning, but
[50:23] an ambition is something that strives
[50:25] you and pushes you. And you can look at
[50:28] the children of Israel. They had an
[50:31] ambition to get to the promised land
[50:33] until they got in the promised land.
[50:36] Then they lost their ambition. It was
[50:38] right after they came into the promised
[50:39] land. What were they saying? Give us a
[50:41] king. so that we can be like the other
[50:43] nations. And it was the prophet that
[50:46] would say, "Have I told you anything
[50:47] wrong? Have I ever taken your money?
[50:49] Have I ever done this? Or what have I
[50:51] done to offend you? You've done nothing
[50:54] wrong, but we want to look like the
[50:56] other ones." What was it? Their
[50:57] spiritual ambition was changed to a
[51:00] worldly ambition where they wanted to
[51:02] fit in with the other nations. Oh my, I
[51:05] don't believe that's what God has called
[51:07] us to do. We're walking upon the earth,
[51:10] but we're not a part of it. There's an
[51:12] ambition that God has given us that sets
[51:16] us apart. That's why we're a stranger
[51:18] walking in the in the the middle of Leo
[51:21] because we don't fit in with him. You
[51:23] see, the devil tries to get you to fit
[51:25] in with him, but we're called for
[51:27] another purpose. We're called to produce
[51:30] something different. And brother
[51:32] Brandham would tell us that if you don't
[51:34] have a purpose, you're going to float
[51:36] around. He would talk about the homeless
[51:38] man that would come and knock on the
[51:40] door and say, "Can you give me something
[51:42] to eat?" And brother Brown would bring
[51:43] him in and give him a sandwich. And as
[51:45] he would begin to talk with him, he
[51:47] would say, "Where are you going?"
[51:49] &gt;&gt; The man would say, "Oh, nowhere." He
[51:51] says, "Well, where did you come from?"
[51:52] "Oh." He says, "How long have you been
[51:55] doing this?" He says, "For about 10
[51:56] years." He says, "Where my hat is
[51:58] resting, that is where I call home."
[52:00] Brother Brandham says he had no
[52:02] ambitions to better himself. So he had
[52:05] no ambitions. He was just a drifter.
[52:08] Wherever he was that evening, that's
[52:10] where he would call home. And too many
[52:12] times we get to that place as a
[52:14] Christian. We lose our ambition for the
[52:17] things of God and we're distributed
[52:20] where we're pushed by this or pushed by
[52:22] that trial. We're pushed by this trial.
[52:24] We're pushed by this career choice or
[52:26] pushed by what this one says or what
[52:28] that one says. And we fail to realize
[52:31] that we are a pilgrim marching on with a
[52:34] spiritual ambition. Brother Brandon
[52:37] would say, "Now that's just about the
[52:38] attitude of the people. Just what I'll
[52:41] call drifters, floaters." And the people
[52:43] who join the church is just about the
[52:45] same. I've often thought of floating
[52:47] driftwood. Driftwood. It just hangs up
[52:50] on any kind of trash. That's just the
[52:52] way it is with floaters does in the
[52:55] church or anywhere. No, you're take on a
[52:57] stream like the stream of life and
[52:59] plenty of driftwood hanging up in every
[53:02] trash pile. And yet the boat comes along
[53:05] made out of the wood tomb. But if you
[53:07] notice, the wood is shaped out by a
[53:10] master who has built that boat. Not only
[53:13] is it shaped out, but it is guided by a
[53:16] master. And it is pushed by a power.
[53:18] We're all made out of the same stuff. It
[53:21] just depends on how your ambitions run.
[53:24] You see, the boat has another a
[53:26] different ambition than the driftwood
[53:28] because it has a motor. It can't sit
[53:31] still even if it wanted to because
[53:33] there's something behind it that is
[53:35] pushing it down the stream of life. And
[53:38] that's what happens when you get the
[53:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It pushes you
[53:43] in a certain direction. and the friends
[53:46] that might be hung up on this and on the
[53:48] family members that might be hung up and
[53:50] they're just drifting and floating.
[53:52] You've got a different ambition. It's
[53:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is
[53:57] pushing you down the stream of life
[54:00] towards the mark of the high prize. And
[54:02] I believe that that's what has happened
[54:05] with the bride of Jesus Christ. We can
[54:07] look around at all of the driftwood.
[54:09] Look at this church member. Look at that
[54:11] family member. But yet there is
[54:13] something on the inside of our life that
[54:16] is making us act like Christians. What
[54:19] is it? We're citizens of another
[54:21] country. Hallelujah. And the natural
[54:24] always types the spiritual. Brother
[54:26] Brandon would tell us that. So if a
[54:28] natural pilgrim has to have a natural
[54:30] ambition, so does a spiritual pilgrim
[54:33] have to have some ambition. And brother
[54:35] Brandon was saying, she said, "Well
[54:37] then," talking about his wife, "Well
[54:39] then, we're not Americans. What are we?"
[54:41] I said, and it's incredible because I
[54:43] have this quote in my notes and brother
[54:45] Sam Parker posted this on one of our
[54:47] ministers chat and he and brother
[54:49] Brandham was saying and she said, 'Well
[54:50] then, we're not Americans. What are we?
[54:52] I said, our kingdom is above. See, we
[54:55] are free, born again. The kingdom of God
[54:58] is within you. See, act like up there.
[55:01] You're delegates from there. I said
[55:04] we're citizens here living here in the
[55:07] flesh, but our spirits, we are pilgrims
[55:10] and strangers. We are foreign to the
[55:12] world, even our own nation. For we have
[55:15] accepted the invitation when a knocked
[55:18] on our heart to become a part of him,
[55:21] his word. And the word fixes us and
[55:24] makes us live, makes us act like
[55:26] Christians. So he says our flesh is
[55:29] citizens of America but it's our spirits
[55:33] that is pilgrims and as strangers. And
[55:35] the Bible would tell us whatever is in
[55:37] your heart is what your mouth is going
[55:39] to speak. So if your heart is as a
[55:42] citizen of this world that's what the
[55:44] flesh is going to act out. But if your
[55:48] heart is a citizen that the kingdom of
[55:50] God that's what's going to produce
[55:53] through your flesh. And it's incredible
[55:56] because the word is to make us act like
[55:58] Christians. There's our ambitions. You
[56:00] may say, "What is spiritual ambition?"
[56:03] Whatever the word says, that's what you
[56:05] do. Oh, hallelujah. If the word says to
[56:08] kick out a certain thing, you kick it
[56:10] out. If the message says do this, you do
[56:12] it. You see, it's an ambition that God
[56:15] has given you. And if you're a citizen
[56:17] of the kingdom of God, that's what
[56:20] you're going to produce. Hallelujah. You
[56:22] see, because many times we we we we
[56:25] quote the sinner's prayer, and that's
[56:27] great and all, but what about the
[56:28] ambitions? You see, because the Bible
[56:31] would tell us with their lips, they
[56:32] profess me, but their heart is far from
[56:35] me. And here, brother Brandham is
[56:36] telling us, how do you become a citizen
[56:40] or a pilgrim and a stranger? He says, we
[56:43] become a part of the word when we accept
[56:46] the invitation that the word does when
[56:49] it knocks on our heart. So, it's more
[56:51] than a sinner's prayer or or or or or
[56:54] reciting something, but when the word
[56:57] knocks on your heart, you accept it in.
[57:00] You see, that's what a conscience is. A
[57:02] conscience tells you when you're wrong
[57:04] or when you're right. And whenever you
[57:06] deny your conscience, brother Brown tell
[57:08] us the conscience begins to get
[57:10] calloused. Right? And many times the
[57:13] spiritual ambition of the word of God
[57:15] can knock on your heart. But if you
[57:18] refuse to accept that invitation, then
[57:20] that conscience becomes callous. But I
[57:23] don't believe our conscience needs to
[57:25] become callous. Whenever the word knocks
[57:27] on our heart, I believe we can say,
[57:30] "Yeah, yeah, and amen." Whatever the
[57:32] word says, I believe it. If it's a hard
[57:34] thing, I believe it. If it's something
[57:37] easy, I believe it. You see, it's
[57:39] incredible because that's why we can
[57:41] believe for big things whenever we're
[57:43] lining up with the little things. You
[57:45] see, brother Brandon would say in one
[57:47] place, he would say that that that the
[57:50] that that a preacher told him, you know,
[57:52] how come you're how come you're you're
[57:53] you're always you're always getting on
[57:55] uh uh dresses and long hair and makeup?
[57:58] He says, why don't you teach them the
[57:59] big things? Teach them how to speak in
[58:01] tongues. He says, "How can I teach them
[58:03] algebra whenever they don't even know
[58:05] their ABCs?" He says, "I can't tell them
[58:07] to do something when God has already
[58:10] told them to do something and they can't
[58:12] even do that." Oh, and he says here, the
[58:15] Bible says a woman's not to put on a
[58:17] garment pertaining to a man. He says
[58:19] that's something she can do that God
[58:22] told her to do and she can't even do
[58:24] that. Oh my. You see, it's ambitious. We
[58:27] once many times we want to preach, look
[58:29] over, say, "Yeah, you can do this. You
[58:31] do that." See a vision over us. Why why
[58:34] would we look for something like that
[58:36] when God has already given us a vision
[58:38] that we can line up our life with and
[58:41] produce the promises that God has given
[58:44] us. Hallelujah. You see, your ambitions
[58:47] is what drives you. Brother Brandon
[58:49] would say, you make yourself when you're
[58:51] young, you set your ambitions to what
[58:53] you want to do. He says what you're
[58:55] trying to achieve in life, you think of
[58:58] it. And he says, and you think of it, of
[59:00] course, your mind. And he says here in
[59:03] your mind is presented into your mind by
[59:05] an unknown something that dominates your
[59:08] mind and when you be when it becomes in
[59:10] your mind then you speak it that you're
[59:13] going to do it then your ambitions drive
[59:16] you to it. And I think that is powerful
[59:19] because he's talking about the natural,
[59:21] but you can take the same thing in the
[59:24] spiritual. When you take on the mind of
[59:26] Christ, then that tells you the
[59:28] direction to go. Then it drops into the
[59:31] heart and then it starts to drive you in
[59:34] the direction that God wants you to go.
[59:38] Hallelujah. Brother Brandon would say in
[59:40] one place, he would say that eagles have
[59:42] high ambitions. He says their their he
[59:44] says their their nest ain't built here
[59:46] upon the earth, but it's built up in the
[59:48] heights. It's built upon a high rock or
[59:51] or a high tree. He says eagles have high
[59:54] ambitions. Then he would stop and would
[59:56] say so does the church of the living
[59:58] God. We have high ambitions. So what I'm
[1:00:02] trying to say is in order for us to be a
[1:00:04] pilgrim, we have to have the right
[1:00:07] ambitions. that once we have the right
[1:00:10] ambitions, we become a part of the word.
[1:00:13] And the more we become a part of the
[1:00:14] word, the less we're acting like the
[1:00:16] world. The aspir that the less we're
[1:00:19] looking like the world because we have
[1:00:21] one ambition, one goal, that is Jesus
[1:00:24] Christ and the word alone. I believe
[1:00:28] that's your desire this morning. That is
[1:00:30] my ambition. This message is my
[1:00:32] ambition. If it says I can make a
[1:00:35] rapture, I'm going to strive for it. If
[1:00:37] it says I can see my children saved, I'm
[1:00:39] going to strive for it. If it says I can
[1:00:42] be in a body change, I'm going to strive
[1:00:44] for it. Hallelujah. That's my drive.
[1:00:47] That's my direction is what this message
[1:00:50] says I can have.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. That's what we can
[1:00:55] have. Oh my. And I love him. Brother
[1:00:58] Brand putting it as a quote I read
[1:01:00] earlier. We're citizens here living in
[1:01:02] the flesh, but our spirits were pilgrims
[1:01:05] and strangers. We're foreign to the
[1:01:07] world now, even our own nation. For we
[1:01:09] have accepted the invitation when it
[1:01:12] knocked at our heart to become a part of
[1:01:15] him, his word. So the word is knocking
[1:01:18] upon hearts. And the only ones that can
[1:01:21] accept it is the ones that have a heart
[1:01:23] to receive it. You can look at 1 Peter
[1:01:26] 2:11. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as
[1:01:29] strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[1:01:31] fleshly lusts which war against the
[1:01:34] soul. In other words, if you're a
[1:01:36] pilgrim and a stranger, there's going to
[1:01:39] be a drive that is pushing you away from
[1:01:42] le from from fleshly lusts which war
[1:01:45] against the soul. And brother Brandham
[1:01:47] is showing us how do we become a part of
[1:01:50] the word. When it knocks on the when it
[1:01:53] knocks on your heart, you accept it. So
[1:01:55] accepting it is more than just quoting
[1:01:58] it. It's accepting it. As I as I quoted
[1:02:01] this earlier, Matthew 15:8, the people
[1:02:03] draweth nigh unto me with their mouth
[1:02:06] and honorth me with their lips, but
[1:02:08] their heart is far from me, but in vain
[1:02:10] they do worship me. And so if it's just
[1:02:13] a lip service, your worship is in vain.
[1:02:16] I don't want my worship to be in vain to
[1:02:18] you. But if it's from the heart, that's
[1:02:20] where God is going to meet the
[1:02:22] worshipper. As I preached this last time
[1:02:24] on God's provided place of worship, we
[1:02:27] got to make sure we're coming to the
[1:02:29] right place. Not the right location per
[1:02:31] per se, but it's the right place. If we
[1:02:34] if we're worshiping under the right
[1:02:36] anointing, then God can meet us where
[1:02:39] our heart is. You see, and so we're
[1:02:41] living in the day where Christ is on the
[1:02:43] outside of the church knocking. And I
[1:02:45] thought it's incredible brother Moro
[1:02:47] would quote this earlier. The Bible
[1:02:49] would say in Revelations 3:20, "Behold,
[1:02:51] I stand at the door and knock. If any
[1:02:53] man hear my voice and open the door, I
[1:02:56] will come into him and will s with him
[1:02:59] and he with me." Brother Brandon would
[1:03:01] tell us this is the condition of the
[1:03:04] church. But he didn't say the bride.
[1:03:06] That's why brother Brandon would preach
[1:03:07] a bride age because we're not a part of
[1:03:10] the church that has Christ on the
[1:03:12] outside of the church knocking to get
[1:03:14] in. We're a part of a bride in an eagle
[1:03:17] age where we have accepted the
[1:03:20] invitation when the word is knocked upon
[1:03:23] our hearts. That's why I believe in a
[1:03:25] bride age. Come on. That's a bright
[1:03:27] anointing that has called us up higher
[1:03:29] and said you're not a part of Leoria.
[1:03:32] You're not a part of their sins. You're
[1:03:34] not a part separated from among them. Be
[1:03:37] not partakers of her sins or her
[1:03:39] plagues. It's a pride age that God has
[1:03:42] called us to step into by accepting the
[1:03:45] word when it knocks upon our heart. And
[1:03:48] I say the word is knocking this morning.
[1:03:50] Open up your heart and accept it.
[1:03:53] Whatever it says, I accept it. I believe
[1:03:55] it. I confess it and I'm going to
[1:03:57] achieve it. Whatever the word says, I
[1:04:00] believe it. Hallelujah. Oh my. So here
[1:04:04] the Bible is giving the church a chance,
[1:04:07] but their heart is far from them. far
[1:04:09] from Christ. I stand at the door and
[1:04:11] knock. If any man will open the door, I
[1:04:14] will come and suck with him. But their
[1:04:16] heart is far from him. But then you can
[1:04:19] look at the bride. We can read this in
[1:04:21] John 10 27. My sheep hear my voice and I
[1:04:25] know them and they follow me. There's
[1:04:28] three things in this verse that really
[1:04:30] stood out to me. The first thing was my
[1:04:32] sheep hear my voice. You see, when you
[1:04:35] look at Revelation 3, there's no
[1:04:37] claiming. I knock on the door, if any
[1:04:40] man, hear my voice or open the door, I
[1:04:42] will come in. You see, but here in John
[1:04:45] 10, it's a claiming. This ain't a
[1:04:47] whosoever will, let him come. This is my
[1:04:50] sheep will hear my voice. There's a
[1:04:53] desire on the inside of their heart.
[1:04:56] This ain't a whosoever will. I'm just
[1:04:58] going to throw it. I hope they get it.
[1:05:00] But then the second part of that verse
[1:05:01] is, "And I know them." So the very
[1:05:04] reason that I'm sending my voice is
[1:05:07] because I know there's a heart to
[1:05:09] receive it. He's not just knocking. I
[1:05:12] hope they open. I hope they open. But my
[1:05:14] sheep will know my voice because I know
[1:05:17] them. I know them which are mine. And I
[1:05:19] am not going to lose a one. Do you
[1:05:22] wonder why you're here today and your
[1:05:24] friends are still out in the world? Do
[1:05:26] you wonder why you got family members
[1:05:28] that despise this message, but yet you
[1:05:31] got a heart to receive it? because
[1:05:33] there's an elected seed uh on the inside
[1:05:36] of your heart that when the word came
[1:05:38] across your path, you say, "Yes, amen.
[1:05:41] I'm opening up my heart and receiving
[1:05:44] the invitation, my sheep will hear my
[1:05:47] voice." And I say, "Lord, this sheep has
[1:05:50] heard your voice. This sheep has heard
[1:05:53] the voice of the son of man in this
[1:05:55] generation." We've accepted the
[1:05:58] invitation and we say, "Lord, it is our
[1:06:01] ambition.
[1:06:03] It is my desire. It is my achievement.
[1:06:07] This is what I'm striving for. My sheep
[1:06:10] will hear my voice.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand, I'm going to say this.
[1:06:15] See, Jesus said, "My sheep know my
[1:06:18] voice. They know my word." They see it
[1:06:21] when it's vindicated for that age. So,
[1:06:24] my sheep will know my vindicated word.
[1:06:27] And I believe his sheep has heard his
[1:06:29] word in this generation. You see, and
[1:06:33] it's incredible because my sheep will
[1:06:35] hear my voice and I know them. You
[1:06:38] remember that Jesus would talk about the
[1:06:40] kingdom of heaven is like a net, right?
[1:06:43] He cast it into the sea and it attracts
[1:06:46] all kind. But then only the ones that is
[1:06:50] elected to it is going to stay. But the
[1:06:52] Brown would dramatize it and would say,
[1:06:54] "You throw it into the ocean." And he
[1:06:57] would say, "What happens is it says the
[1:07:00] influence of the gospel, it catches
[1:07:02] many. It attracts many." And he says,
[1:07:05] "It's about a week later, he says, you
[1:07:07] got the you got the water spiders in
[1:07:10] there and they're having a good time,
[1:07:11] but then they have to give up
[1:07:13] something." And he says, "Oh, I ain't
[1:07:15] going to do this." He jumps out of the
[1:07:16] net. He says, "Then there's a crab in
[1:07:18] there that's in there for about a week."
[1:07:20] And he says, "I got him." And then it
[1:07:22] says, "You got to give up your cards."
[1:07:24] And he says, he jumps out of the net. He
[1:07:26] says, "What is it?" The net didn't have
[1:07:28] anything to do with it. It was a water
[1:07:31] spider before the net. So the wet the
[1:07:34] net did not make a water spider or water
[1:07:37] spider. And that net did not make a fish
[1:07:40] a fish. It was a fish before the net
[1:07:42] came. And when the net came, since it
[1:07:45] was a fish, it would stay there and
[1:07:48] would be gathered with the king would be
[1:07:50] gathered with the one trying to catch
[1:07:52] it. And this message did not make you
[1:07:55] bride of Christ. It came to you because
[1:07:57] you was the bride of Christ. There's
[1:08:00] many that was been in this church, but
[1:08:02] lasted for a little bit and would go out
[1:08:04] the doors. It's because there was no
[1:08:06] heart to receive him. But you are still
[1:08:09] standing today. You've been through
[1:08:11] heartaches. You've been through
[1:08:12] heartbreaks. You've been through trials.
[1:08:14] You've been through circumstances.
[1:08:16] You've been through times you thought
[1:08:18] you could not take another step. But you
[1:08:20] are still here because you were elected
[1:08:24] from before the foundation of the world.
[1:08:27] Where would we go? For thou hast the
[1:08:30] words of eternal life. I can't go
[1:08:32] anywhere else. This message is my
[1:08:35] identity.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's who I am. I come from
[1:08:40] God and I go back to God.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; It's who I am.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; This message didn't make you bright.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; It has brought out the potentials
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; that was laying there.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He saved the bread. And I'll just read
[1:08:55] the quote. He says, "What happens?" He
[1:08:57] says, "Watch what happens. The influence
[1:08:59] of the gospel catches many." He said,
[1:09:01] "It's about the first week. The old
[1:09:03] serpent now." He looks and says, "If I'm
[1:09:06] going to have to give up all this other
[1:09:07] stuff, give up my cards, my tobacco." He
[1:09:10] says, "Right back into the water." He
[1:09:11] goes, "Miss water spider sits up there,
[1:09:14] looks around, and she says, "Huh? You
[1:09:16] mean I can't go to my clubs and do
[1:09:18] things here? I have to take off my
[1:09:20] makeup and let my hair grow out, take
[1:09:23] off my shorts, hump, plop, plop, plop,
[1:09:26] just a hog to his wallet as a dog in its
[1:09:28] vomit. He says, "No, what was she? She
[1:09:31] was caught in the net and the net
[1:09:33] brought it to the altar. He says, "But
[1:09:35] he was a snake to begin with. It's a
[1:09:38] spider to begin with." The net had
[1:09:41] nothing to do with it. It only pulled
[1:09:43] them up here and the fish was a fish to
[1:09:47] start with. That's exactly right. And my
[1:09:50] sheep will hear my voice. Hallelujah.
[1:09:53] You see, so he was attracted. Brother
[1:09:55] Brandon, I'm going to talk about the
[1:09:56] third the three poles, right? The first
[1:09:58] pull is the little fish. The second one
[1:09:59] is a a little bigger ones. But the third
[1:10:01] pull was not for the for the little
[1:10:03] fish. It was for the big fish. So it was
[1:10:06] an attraction at the first part, but
[1:10:09] then whenever started to come against
[1:10:11] the theology or what they thought was
[1:10:13] right, they would fall away from it. But
[1:10:15] the bride would say, "No, this is what
[1:10:17] I've been looking for. This is the
[1:10:19] desire that has been in my heart. This
[1:10:22] is what I have been looking for."
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the third part of that
[1:10:27] verse that really spoke to my heart and
[1:10:30] they follow me. My sheep know my voice.
[1:10:33] I know them and they follow me. And so
[1:10:36] there's something now you got to do. The
[1:10:38] first two part the first two parts was
[1:10:40] God sending a message or or putting a
[1:10:42] seed there sending a message. But now
[1:10:45] we've got something to do and they
[1:10:47] follow me. So if you're a stranger to
[1:10:50] the world, you're not a stranger to the
[1:10:53] things of God. You can look at John
[1:10:54] 10:5. and a stranger they will not
[1:10:57] follow but will flee from them for they
[1:11:00] know not the voice of strangers. So if
[1:11:02] you're a stranger to the world now the
[1:11:05] the the world is a stranger to you. So
[1:11:08] when that voice comes you do not hear
[1:11:10] the voice of strangers. You hear you
[1:11:13] hear only one voice that is the voice of
[1:11:16] almighty God. You remember brother
[1:11:18] Brandon would tell the story when he was
[1:11:20] in the Middle East and there was a
[1:11:22] shepherd that had all his sheep that was
[1:11:24] coming through the coming through town
[1:11:25] and he would tell us that their markets
[1:11:27] up there ain't like ours here not in
[1:11:30] buildings it's along the streets right
[1:11:32] and he would say he would be watching
[1:11:34] these and that they would come across
[1:11:36] the intersection and all the cars were
[1:11:38] stopped they was watching and brother
[1:11:39] Brandham looked and he says well it's
[1:11:41] going to get crazy now because once
[1:11:43] those sheep begin to see all of these
[1:11:46] fruit all the fruit, all the bread,
[1:11:47] they're going to go crazy. And they went
[1:11:49] across the street and they didn't they
[1:11:52] didn't detour off. But the Brandham says
[1:11:54] they were looking at one thing, not the
[1:11:56] vegetables, not the fruit. They were
[1:11:57] watching the shepherd. Oh, my sheep know
[1:12:00] my voice and a stranger they will not
[1:12:03] follow. Our eyes is upon one thing, not
[1:12:06] a ministry, not a man, not gifts, not
[1:12:09] thus sayaeth the Lord, but our men, our
[1:12:12] eyes is upon thee, thus sayaith the
[1:12:14] Lord, that has been given to us in this
[1:12:16] generation. Not man's feelings, not
[1:12:19] man's ideas, not man's sensations, but
[1:12:22] we are following the voice of the son of
[1:12:24] man that has been given in this
[1:12:27] generation. My sheep know my voice and
[1:12:29] they will not follow them. They are
[1:12:31] following one thing that is the voice of
[1:12:33] almighty God. Hallelujah. Brother Brown,
[1:12:36] I'm going say this here. When you see a
[1:12:38] scripture and you see it here and here
[1:12:40] and here and here and you ask your
[1:12:42] pastor about it and he says, "Oh, those
[1:12:45] are for another day." If you're a child
[1:12:47] of God, he says, "You won't believe
[1:12:49] that." No, sir. Well, when it said Jesus
[1:12:52] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:12:54] forever, works that I do, you shall do
[1:12:56] also. You see what he was? You see the
[1:12:59] promise here and then your pastor says,
[1:13:02] "Oh, that's nonsense. There's nothing
[1:13:04] like that." You won't believe that
[1:13:06] because you're not a spider. You're not
[1:13:08] a snake. You are a fish. See, there it
[1:13:11] is. You're not a goat or a pig. You are
[1:13:14] a lamb. Hallelujah. He says, "Whenever
[1:13:16] you notice something different, you see
[1:13:18] the word here, the message lines up with
[1:13:20] this, the message lines up with that."
[1:13:22] And then you go to family members and
[1:13:24] they say, "Oh, that's not true. That's
[1:13:26] not true." But there's still something
[1:13:27] in the heart that says, "Yes, it is."
[1:13:30] It's because you're not a spider. You're
[1:13:32] a fish. You're not serpent seed. You are
[1:13:35] the bride of Jesus Christ. You might be
[1:13:38] a stranger, but you are an elected
[1:13:41] stranger.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't get away from it
[1:13:46] even if you wanted to. That's the
[1:13:48] difference between you and the serpent
[1:13:49] sea. They're strangers, but they're not
[1:13:52] elected. They're vagabonds, but they're
[1:13:54] not elected. But you are a stranger that
[1:13:57] has been elected from before the
[1:13:59] foundation of the world. You see the
[1:14:02] first verse is Paul or Peter an apostle
[1:14:04] of Jesus Christ to the to the strangers.
[1:14:07] Then the second verse elected according
[1:14:10] to the fornowledge of God. You might be
[1:14:12] a stranger but before you was here you
[1:14:15] was already in the mind of God. Oh
[1:14:19] hallelujah. So we was elected from
[1:14:22] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:14:25] as you're receiving the word, brother
[1:14:27] Brandham tell us, you become the word.
[1:14:29] And so as you're receiving the word,
[1:14:31] there's a separation that is taking
[1:14:33] place from you and the voices of the
[1:14:36] world, the enemy that comes against you.
[1:14:38] Brother Brandon would say this here. So
[1:14:40] Jesus was the word made flesh. He was
[1:14:43] completely separated from sinners,
[1:14:45] unbelievers. that the word itself flowed
[1:14:49] completely and forally flow through him
[1:14:52] that he said I do nothing until I see
[1:14:55] the father do it first that was asking
[1:14:57] and questioning him about things he said
[1:14:59] verily I say unto you the son of man can
[1:15:02] do or the son can do nothing in himself
[1:15:04] but what he sees the father do he says
[1:15:07] watch everything that he said was
[1:15:09] perfect just he had not to ask about it
[1:15:12] think about it it was perfect and this
[1:15:15] is what I think is powerful and he would
[1:15:17] say this here and his perfect truth
[1:15:19] always separated the truth from the
[1:15:23] error. So when you're accepting truth
[1:15:26] and when it's going to separate you from
[1:15:28] the voices of the world that comes
[1:15:31] against you. You see? So in order to be
[1:15:33] a pilgrim, you have to accept truth. And
[1:15:36] then that's going to put you on a
[1:15:37] journey that is separating you from the
[1:15:40] voices of the enemy. And that's why
[1:15:42] Jesus makes the claim, my sheep will
[1:15:44] know my voice because there's many other
[1:15:47] voices. He knew he would you would be in
[1:15:49] the middle of Leota with voices of
[1:15:51] denominationalism, voices of theology,
[1:15:54] voices of pornography, voices of this
[1:15:57] and of that. But he would claim you, my
[1:16:00] sheep will know my voice. And that voice
[1:16:04] is going to separate them from the other
[1:16:06] voices that is going to try to attract
[1:16:09] them.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's going to separate them
[1:16:14] from every other voice. And and that's
[1:16:16] the reason the Bible would tell us in
[1:16:17] Amos 3 and 3. Can two walk together
[1:16:20] except they be agreed? You can't walk
[1:16:23] together unless you're agreed. And
[1:16:24] you're going to agree with something.
[1:16:27] You see, and that's why I believe that
[1:16:28] you can make this message your absolute.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's why I believe you
[1:16:33] can man I heard a a preacher the other
[1:16:35] day that that was blasting that that
[1:16:37] people say it's your absolute. He says
[1:16:39] the Bible's my absolute. Sin is mine,
[1:16:41] too. But what would the Bible say?
[1:16:44] What's the interpretation without the
[1:16:46] message? You can't explain to me
[1:16:48] Revelations without this message.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Come on. It took an interpretation to
[1:16:53] come and separate you from the voices of
[1:16:56] error and place you upon a solid rock.
[1:16:59] You see, I I had a brother tell me one
[1:17:01] time that and and I and I was a young
[1:17:04] evangelist and and and and I thought
[1:17:06] everybody believed the same and and I
[1:17:09] was preaching. I preached the message
[1:17:10] the absolute and he hammered me, man. He
[1:17:13] hammered me for about 45 minutes and and
[1:17:16] I I get back to the I get back home and
[1:17:18] and he starts texting me, hammering me
[1:17:20] saying, "I'm just a parrot. I don't
[1:17:22] study. I don't have revelation for
[1:17:24] myself." And what's incredible is he's
[1:17:27] hammering me on these things. And he
[1:17:28] says, "You can't believe what somebody
[1:17:30] else said. You got to you got to believe
[1:17:32] what what you believe. You got to get a
[1:17:34] revelation for yourself." And then he
[1:17:36] stops and he says, "Well, I've got some
[1:17:38] files of material I've been studying
[1:17:40] going. if you want, I can give this to
[1:17:42] you and you can see where I'm coming
[1:17:44] from. And I said, I think I'll just keep
[1:17:46] the message as my absolute. Come on now.
[1:17:48] He wanted me to do away with the message
[1:17:50] and take him as an absolute. But why
[1:17:52] would I do that when we had to vindicate
[1:17:55] a prophet with thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:17:58] separate us from error and give us
[1:18:01] truth.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because brother Brown, I'm
[1:18:04] going to say this here. No, every great
[1:18:06] achievement is tied to an absolute. You
[1:18:09] cannot run life without having an
[1:18:11] absolute. You can't make an achievement
[1:18:14] without it being an absolute for it is
[1:18:16] the final tiepost. It's the hitch track
[1:18:19] at the end of the journey. It's a place
[1:18:22] where you are tied to something. So you
[1:18:25] can't have an ambition without having a
[1:18:27] tiepost. Come on now. So in order for
[1:18:30] this message to be your ambition, it's
[1:18:33] got to be your absolute. Then once it
[1:18:35] becomes your absolute, it's your final
[1:18:37] say. And then you're pressing on,
[1:18:39] brother say, because we are coming to a
[1:18:42] spot where there was something presented
[1:18:44] to Christianity, something they have to
[1:18:47] make a decision on. And I think the
[1:18:49] Christian church ought to have something
[1:18:51] that they are known that they are tied
[1:18:54] to. Instead of floating about like a
[1:18:56] leaf upon water, the wind as the Bible
[1:18:59] said carried about every wind of
[1:19:01] doctrines. He says the winds come and
[1:19:03] blow little leaf this way. another wind
[1:19:05] comes, the north wind, the south wind,
[1:19:07] the the the the east wind, the west
[1:19:09] wind, you'll never get anywhere, you're
[1:19:11] not stable. A Christian life should be a
[1:19:15] stable life. And in order to have a
[1:19:17] stable life, you got to be tied to
[1:19:20] something. And I believe we've been
[1:19:22] given something that we can tie yourself
[1:19:24] to because once you're tied to it, it's
[1:19:27] separating you. you I know I've given
[1:19:29] the example before that that the the
[1:19:32] remember when Jesus would would would
[1:19:33] send his disciples to go to the to go
[1:19:36] into the city and get the the donkey
[1:19:37] that was tied right he would tell them
[1:19:39] if any man had stopped you and ask you
[1:19:42] what are you doing tell them I have need
[1:19:44] for that donkey and he would say loose
[1:19:47] him and bring him to me so in order for
[1:19:49] that donkey to fulfill the purpose of
[1:19:52] Jesus he had to be untied you see too
[1:19:55] many times we're tied to other ambitions
[1:19:58] We're tied to other absolutes and the
[1:20:00] word is pulling on you. I've I've called
[1:20:03] you to fulfill this. I've called you to
[1:20:05] fulfill that. I've called you to fulfill
[1:20:07] this. But yet, we're tied to something
[1:20:09] else. But I believe there is still a
[1:20:11] five-fold ministry that will stand up
[1:20:14] against the other voices and says, "God
[1:20:17] has need for him. God has need for that
[1:20:19] young person. God has need for that
[1:20:21] mama. God has need for that daddy. Loose
[1:20:24] him and let him go." And I believe
[1:20:27] that's what the word does. When perfect
[1:20:29] truth is separating you from error, it's
[1:20:32] loosening you from other ambitions that
[1:20:35] you can fulfill the purpose that God has
[1:20:38] for your life.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's still loosening this
[1:20:43] morning. And I believe the word this
[1:20:44] morning can loosen you
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; because you can hear the word, but if
[1:20:49] you're not tied to it, you're going to
[1:20:51] have it's going to it's going to be just
[1:20:52] rules and restrictions and dos and
[1:20:54] don'ts. Remember the two that walked in
[1:20:57] the road to Emmas. They were talking
[1:20:59] about Christ, but yet they were
[1:21:00] discouraged. And it's incredible because
[1:21:02] here the Bible says Christ himself drew
[1:21:05] near unto them and would say, "What are
[1:21:07] you talking about?" Here they're talking
[1:21:09] about the things that just happened and
[1:21:11] will look at Jesus and would say this
[1:21:14] here. Are you a stranger in these parts?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; You see, the world is to be a stranger
[1:21:19] to you, not the word of God.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Come on now. when somebody when
[1:21:24] something else is your ambition, the
[1:21:26] word of God's a stranger. You see, we're
[1:21:29] not to be a pilgrim and a stranger for
[1:21:31] the world. We're to be a pilgrim and a
[1:21:33] stranger for the word of God.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz here they were, they
[1:21:37] were talking about the word, but they
[1:21:39] hadn't received it yet. Remember the
[1:21:41] invitation knocking on the door. You
[1:21:43] have to accept that. Accept the
[1:21:45] invitation. Then you become the word. So
[1:21:47] you hear brother the brother the Bible
[1:21:49] would tell us that Jesus walks with him
[1:21:51] and was teaching them the scripture
[1:21:54] about himself. Brother Brandham would
[1:21:56] tell us that they could not they that
[1:21:58] their eyes was still holding the Bible
[1:22:00] tells us their eyes was holding that
[1:22:02] they could not see him. Brother Brandham
[1:22:04] would tell us you can preach the word
[1:22:05] teach the word but you have to receive
[1:22:08] the word. What's the word receive?
[1:22:10] Permit to enter. So in order for the
[1:22:13] word to change you, you got to receive
[1:22:15] it in and allow it to become your
[1:22:18] absolute. And it's incredible cuz Jesus
[1:22:21] asked them, "What manner of
[1:22:23] communications are these that ye are
[1:22:25] sad?" And that really really jumped out
[1:22:28] to me because they're talking about the
[1:22:30] word, but it's having a negative effect
[1:22:32] on their life.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; They're talking about the word, but it's
[1:22:35] glooming because they don't see the word
[1:22:38] being fulfilled. And what's incredible
[1:22:40] is the Bible tells us that when Jesus
[1:22:42] asked them, "What are you all talking
[1:22:43] about?" There were then they he started
[1:22:45] to quote the the the the events that was
[1:22:48] that that took place the previous days
[1:22:51] and they're going on how that the the
[1:22:53] the two ladies went to the supplr and
[1:22:56] the body of Jesus was gone and this is
[1:22:58] the third day and Jesus stops and says,
[1:23:01] "Oh fool, it's slow of heart to believe.
[1:23:04] Ain't this what I said would happen?"
[1:23:07] But before they could before they
[1:23:09] accepted it, they could not see that
[1:23:12] this is things happening in present day.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've got to accept it.
[1:23:19] Allow it to enter in order to see the
[1:23:22] manifestations of that work. And then
[1:23:25] the Bible tells us that he rebukes them
[1:23:27] and he goes and it's about the evening
[1:23:29] time. It's the evening hour. And the
[1:23:31] Bible says he acted as if he was going
[1:23:33] to go by their house. And what did the
[1:23:35] Bible say? They constrained him and
[1:23:38] said, "Come in with us." But the Brandon
[1:23:40] says right there, they received the word
[1:23:43] in. And as they received the word in,
[1:23:46] the bread was broke. And then their eyes
[1:23:49] was open. Now watch their confession.
[1:23:51] Their confession went from Yes. It's the
[1:23:54] third day. And the bodies gone. And and
[1:23:57] it's a gloomy atmosphere. I can't
[1:23:59] believe this happened. After their eyes
[1:24:01] was open, the bread was broke. What was
[1:24:04] their confession? Their their their
[1:24:06] ambition changed. It went from glooming
[1:24:09] to did not our heart burn within us as
[1:24:12] he talked with us along the way. They
[1:24:15] went from talking about the word to the
[1:24:17] word talking back to it. We're not just
[1:24:20] talking about a God of a day gone by.
[1:24:23] But that God is still talking to us,
[1:24:26] speaking to hearts, speaking to needs.
[1:24:28] It's still changing atmospheres. It's
[1:24:30] still changing the things you go
[1:24:32] through. if you can only receive it. And
[1:24:35] what's incredible, it was right after
[1:24:37] this, the Bible says that these men that
[1:24:39] these two men would go to the house
[1:24:41] where the rest of the disciples were and
[1:24:44] begin to tell them what Jesus what Jesus
[1:24:47] said to them along the way. And if you
[1:24:50] look at that, look up that word way. It
[1:24:52] means journey. Here they were, they were
[1:24:54] journeying. They were discouraged. They
[1:24:57] felt like Christ had left them. They
[1:24:59] felt like the word missed it here,
[1:25:00] missed it. But when he came and
[1:25:03] interpreted the word after they received
[1:25:05] it, it changed the way they looked at
[1:25:08] their journey. And too many times we
[1:25:10] look at the path we're on. All we see is
[1:25:13] gloomy. All we see is this. All we see
[1:25:15] is that. This one done me wrong. That
[1:25:17] one done me wrong. This one failed me.
[1:25:18] That one failed me. But we fail to
[1:25:20] realize he's still walking with us along
[1:25:23] the way. He's still walking in the
[1:25:26] journey with us. And what's incredible
[1:25:28] is the Bible tells us as he's telling
[1:25:31] them, these two men were telling the
[1:25:33] other disciples what Jesus said to them
[1:25:35] along the way. The Bible says, "Christ
[1:25:37] appeared."
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ appeared among them
[1:25:40] and said, "Peace be unto you." What was
[1:25:42] it? Once they got a different
[1:25:44] perspective of the journey they was
[1:25:47] upon, instead of speaking negative, they
[1:25:50] spoke positive and that brought Christ
[1:25:52] in their very midst. You want to bring
[1:25:54] Christ in your situation? Quit talking
[1:25:57] negative and speak a positive word uh
[1:26:00] over your children, a positive word over
[1:26:03] your situation and watch God come in the
[1:26:06] middle of that situation and say, "Peace
[1:26:08] be to you."
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's still bringing peace in
[1:26:13] the midst of the situations.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you have to change your
[1:26:18] confession. Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Luke 24:33. And they rose up the
[1:26:24] same hour, returned to Jerusalem, and
[1:26:26] found the 11 gathered together, them
[1:26:29] that were with him, saying, "The Lord is
[1:26:32] risen," and at the period of Simon, and
[1:26:34] they told what things were done in the
[1:26:37] way, and how he was known known of them
[1:26:40] in the breaking of bread. And as they
[1:26:43] thus spoke, uh, Luke 24:36, as they thus
[1:26:47] spoke, Jesus himself stood in the midst
[1:26:50] of them, and said unto them, peace be
[1:26:53] unto you. Hallelujah. Cuz it's easy to
[1:26:56] become bitter, ain't it? It's easy
[1:26:58] because what happens many times is we
[1:27:00] feel like God ain't answering our
[1:27:02] prayers whenever it's our own ambitions,
[1:27:05] not God's ambitions. Right? How many can
[1:27:07] testify of that? When you've got your
[1:27:09] own ambitions, your own achievement,
[1:27:11] your own goals, your own thing that
[1:27:13] you're striving for, and when that don't
[1:27:15] work out, you say, "God, what happened?
[1:27:18] I thought you were with me." And here
[1:27:19] here Christ is walking with them, but
[1:27:22] yet they could not see them see him
[1:27:25] until they accepted him. They had to
[1:27:27] throw out their ideas of the situation
[1:27:29] and accept God's ideas. Come on now. You
[1:27:32] got to throw out what you want to do and
[1:27:35] accept what God has for your life. Then
[1:27:38] watch God come in your situation and
[1:27:41] bring a peace, bring a stability, bring
[1:27:43] a direction, bring an absolute in your
[1:27:46] life.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Watch Christ show up because
[1:27:51] if you have the wrong ambition, he's not
[1:27:52] going to show up. You have to have the
[1:27:54] right ambition, the right direction. And
[1:27:57] then you got to make sure the truth is
[1:27:59] separating you from error and not error
[1:28:02] separating you from truth. You're going
[1:28:04] to be separated for something. You see?
[1:28:07] So you got to make sure you're because
[1:28:08] brother Brandon tell us in order to
[1:28:10] believe a lie, you have to refuse the
[1:28:12] truth, right? You got to say the truth
[1:28:14] ain't the truth. So in order to be
[1:28:16] separated from error to perfect truth,
[1:28:20] you got to say that error is a lie. And
[1:28:22] that's hard sometimes because sometimes
[1:28:25] the error is what we're brought up being
[1:28:27] taught, right? And that that that is a
[1:28:29] hard thing sometimes when your mommy
[1:28:31] teaches you that, your grandparents
[1:28:32] teach you that, this one teaches you
[1:28:34] that. And then the word comes in a
[1:28:36] different way. Now it's a battle. What
[1:28:38] do I do? Am I separated from truth to
[1:28:41] the error or am I separated to the truth
[1:28:44] from the error? It's a decision in the
[1:28:47] midst of the crossroads. But perfect
[1:28:50] truth, if you can ever accept it, it
[1:28:53] will separate you from every error that
[1:28:56] comes against you. You see, brother
[1:28:58] Brandon was saying, "Now, we can preach
[1:28:59] the word, explain the word, but you have
[1:29:02] to receive the word." He says,
[1:29:03] "Hallelujah." That's what sets it a
[1:29:06] fire, brother. When you receive it, the
[1:29:08] revelation, something slips out of the
[1:29:11] unseen world yonder, comes rolling down
[1:29:13] through a mystical channel somewhere
[1:29:15] into your soul that says, "Now I see
[1:29:18] it." Your eyes brighten up. Your lips
[1:29:20] that hung down straighten up and smile.
[1:29:23] Every muscle in your body seems to
[1:29:25] rejoice. Something is going to happen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Ain't that incredible? the power of this
[1:29:32] revelation. Once you accept it, not just
[1:29:35] hear it, not just hear it teach, not
[1:29:37] hear it preached, but once you hear
[1:29:39] those things, you receive it, then
[1:29:42] something slips down into the soul. Then
[1:29:45] something goes into the unseen world
[1:29:47] yonder and brings the substance down
[1:29:50] that brings a smile on your face. It
[1:29:52] changes your situation. It changes your
[1:29:54] desires. It changes the things you're
[1:29:57] going through. So it's more than just
[1:29:59] coming to church and hearing it. It's
[1:30:01] coming and receiving it.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then it's separating it.
[1:30:07] Brother Brandon, I'm going say this
[1:30:08] here. Spiritfilled, believing in all
[1:30:10] things, hoping all things, waiting for
[1:30:12] the coming of the Lord, professing to be
[1:30:14] pilgrims and strangers, nothing of this
[1:30:17] world, don't desire it, falling away
[1:30:20] from the things of the world. See what I
[1:30:22] mean? He says, "Egypt, the children of
[1:30:24] Israel left, the boasting physicians of
[1:30:27] Egypt to be with the great physician.
[1:30:29] They left the garlic pots of Egypt to
[1:30:32] eat dangerous food. They left the muddy
[1:30:34] waters of Egypt to drink from the
[1:30:37] spiritual rock." He says, "Amen. You get
[1:30:39] it? On the journey, they had to cut
[1:30:42] loose from Egypt. Let them go." We're
[1:30:46] walking on a journey as well. But you
[1:30:48] got to give up the things of Egypt in
[1:30:51] order to partake of the things of life.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; But you see that the reason there's a
[1:30:56] separation that takes place and I hope
[1:30:58] this is okay this morning
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; that there's an election.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; There's an election on the inside of
[1:31:04] your heart. Brother Brandham was saying
[1:31:06] he said there one day except you he
[1:31:08] talking about Jesus except you eat the
[1:31:10] body the blood drink the blood eat the
[1:31:12] body of the son of man you have no life
[1:31:14] in you. He didn't explain it. He walked
[1:31:17] on and that that's right. See, well,
[1:31:20] they said this man's a cannibal that he
[1:31:22] that to eat his body, drink his blood.
[1:31:24] He's a vampire. See, he wants to become
[1:31:27] a vampire. Them intellectuals, but he
[1:31:29] said my sheep will hear my voice. See,
[1:31:32] it would come to the elected. God had
[1:31:35] elected by fornowledge. And those to the
[1:31:38] father, no man come to me except the
[1:31:41] father draws him. All the father's given
[1:31:43] me, they will come. they will
[1:31:45] understand. The disciples couldn't
[1:31:47] understand it, but they believed it.
[1:31:50] That's right. If you believe him, I
[1:31:52] can't understand many things, but I
[1:31:54] believe it anyhow.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; That's the difference between you and
[1:31:58] serpency. They don't understand it. You
[1:32:01] might not understand it, but there's a
[1:32:03] heart to accept it.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; That says, "I might not understand it,
[1:32:08] but I believe it anyhow." Cuz we don't
[1:32:10] understand it many things. You know,
[1:32:12] like I said the other day, we might not
[1:32:15] understand how the rapture is going to
[1:32:16] happen, but we believe it, right? We
[1:32:19] might not understand how the body change
[1:32:21] is going to happen, but we believe it.
[1:32:23] Brother Brandon would tell would would
[1:32:25] be be talking with a brother and would
[1:32:27] say, and he would say, "Seeing is
[1:32:28] believing." He would say, "Okay, then go
[1:32:30] to the store and buy me some love."
[1:32:33] Right? He says you can't you can't you
[1:32:35] can't the things you can explain
[1:32:37] sometimes ain't even real but it's faith
[1:32:40] in the real things right you see you
[1:32:43] might not be able to explain everything
[1:32:45] but there's faith that accepts it and
[1:32:48] believes it hallelujah brand I'm going
[1:32:51] to talk about Abraham and would say
[1:32:53] notice the word cannot deny itself then
[1:32:55] it is satisfied or it's the desire the
[1:32:58] desire of what what made you desire it
[1:33:02] in the first place because down in your
[1:33:04] soul there was a predestinated seed
[1:33:07] which was eternal. Life was always
[1:33:10] laying in there. Always in there. All
[1:33:12] that the father's given me will come to
[1:33:14] me. Then there there isn't going to be
[1:33:16] one of them to be lost. A thanking man's
[1:33:19] taste. When a thanking man hears the
[1:33:21] word of God, my sheep hear my voice. A
[1:33:23] stranger they will not follow. For down
[1:33:26] in there is life and life connects to
[1:33:29] life. So, so when the word came across
[1:33:32] your path, it was word responding to
[1:33:35] word. Word predestinated to the word
[1:33:37] that was for this day. And then there
[1:33:39] was life that would come together and
[1:33:42] would produce the promises for this
[1:33:45] generation. What made you desire this in
[1:33:47] the first place? There was life on the
[1:33:49] inside that was attractive. You can look
[1:33:52] at the prodical son. I'm sure the
[1:33:54] prodical son wasn't the only one that
[1:33:56] was working there in the pig slot, but
[1:33:58] he was the only one with the desire to
[1:34:00] go back to the father. Come on now. He
[1:34:04] wasn't the only one there. But there was
[1:34:06] a seed that came from the father and
[1:34:08] says, I can go back to him. I come from
[1:34:11] him. I can go back to him. You see,
[1:34:13] you're not the only one that is in the
[1:34:15] middle of lay on a sea. But there's a
[1:34:18] seed. You're an elected stranger in this
[1:34:21] generation that is pulling you back to
[1:34:24] the bosom of God.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Life connects with life.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Abraham going out and looking
[1:34:32] for God and said, "Hey, I want to be the
[1:34:35] I want to be the the prince of nations.
[1:34:38] I want to do this. I want to do that."
[1:34:39] It was God. Brother Brandam say, "Let's
[1:34:41] go back to Genesis 12. God called
[1:34:44] Abraham by grace." Not because he was a
[1:34:47] different person. He was just Abraham,
[1:34:49] just an ordinary man. Not because he was
[1:34:51] a priest or a dignitarian. He was a
[1:34:54] farmer. He came down from the city of
[1:34:57] the ba of the Babylon tower with his
[1:34:59] father and they went to the the the city
[1:35:02] of her. And it's incredible because here
[1:35:05] the grace of God would call Abraham in
[1:35:08] the midst of of the Tower of Babel. And
[1:35:12] and I read this last time, brother
[1:35:13] Brandham would tell us that if there's
[1:35:15] ever a a type of denominations in the
[1:35:18] Bible, he would say it's Babylon, right?
[1:35:20] He said the Tower of Babel, everybody
[1:35:23] had to come and worship at that tower,
[1:35:25] right? The Tower of that's why that's
[1:35:27] where the confusion came from when it
[1:35:29] was a forced religion. He said, "Brother
[1:35:31] Brandon Matellis, that's a forced
[1:35:32] religion." And we can see it today.
[1:35:34] Brother Nathaniel, me and him was at St.
[1:35:36] Simons some years back one time and
[1:35:38] there was a p a prison ministry. They
[1:35:41] they were there simple assignments and I
[1:35:42] believe it was one of the the
[1:35:44] denominations and Peggy was there and
[1:35:46] was like, "Hey, do y'all want to come
[1:35:47] and and go to the prisons and preach
[1:35:49] with us." I said, "That'll be great." So
[1:35:51] they came and and she brought her pastor
[1:35:54] over and gave us a sheet, you know, and
[1:35:56] was like, "Here, do you got to agree
[1:35:58] with all of these things?" And me and
[1:36:00] Nathaniel looks at the sheet and he
[1:36:01] said, "Well, we don't agree with this.
[1:36:03] We don't agree with that." And the
[1:36:04] pastor looks at us and says, "Who
[1:36:06] invited you?" So we we was just hearing
[1:36:08] pizza. And the answer begging asked if
[1:36:11] we wanted to come and he says well okay
[1:36:13] what was it? It's a forced religion. If
[1:36:15] you don't believe the way they believe
[1:36:17] it you're not going to be accepted. So
[1:36:19] here Abram was in the midst of a forced
[1:36:22] religion. But then grace would call his
[1:36:25] name. Brother would tell us you get into
[1:36:27] the bride not by forced religion. You
[1:36:29] get into the bride by election. You come
[1:36:32] into Christ by election. So here Abram
[1:36:35] was in the midst of a forced religion.
[1:36:38] But then grace would come. Life would
[1:36:41] come to life. And would say, Abram,
[1:36:43] separate yourself. Come out of that city
[1:36:47] and come, I'm going. I'm making you a
[1:36:49] prince of nations. I'm making you a
[1:36:51] father of nations. You got to separate
[1:36:54] yourself. And it was grace that would
[1:36:56] call him out of Babylon. It was grace
[1:36:59] that would say, "Get out from among your
[1:37:01] father." It was grace that would say,
[1:37:03] "Separate you from Lot." It was grace
[1:37:06] every step of the way. And what's
[1:37:07] incredible is brother Brown would tell
[1:37:09] us the journey of Abraham is a type of
[1:37:12] the church. He would go through many
[1:37:14] things. He would say Genesis 12, God
[1:37:17] calling Abraham. He says was
[1:37:19] justification. It was Luther. Genesis 15
[1:37:22] God confirming the covenant he says was
[1:37:24] sanctification which was wrestling. He
[1:37:27] says El Shadi. In Genesis 17:1 the Holy
[1:37:31] Ghost he says which is Pentecost. But
[1:37:33] then Genesis 17:15, he says, "Abraham's
[1:37:36] name change was his adoption. It was
[1:37:39] grace every step of the way that would
[1:37:42] call him out. Then there was grace that
[1:37:44] would come and would say, "Hey, I'm
[1:37:46] going to confirm the covenant." It's
[1:37:48] incredible because you look there in
[1:37:50] Genesis, Genesis 15, when God confirms
[1:37:53] the covenant, it was Abraham said, "How
[1:37:55] do I know these things are going to
[1:37:57] happen?" And then God would speak to him
[1:37:59] and was say, "Go get a turtle dove,
[1:38:01] right? Go get up. Go, go get a turtle
[1:38:03] dove, get a she goat, get a ram, and
[1:38:05] then a turtle dove, a turtle dove and a
[1:38:07] young pigeon. He tells them to separate,
[1:38:10] separate the sheep, separate the goat,
[1:38:12] separate the heer, separate the ram, but
[1:38:15] don't separate the pigeon and the turtle
[1:38:17] dove. What was it? He was letting him
[1:38:19] know I'm going to come and walk in the
[1:38:22] midst of my covenant. Brother Brandon
[1:38:25] would tell us how come he did not
[1:38:27] separate the turtle dove. He says that
[1:38:29] the turtle dove and the pigeon is a type
[1:38:32] of divine healing in the both of the
[1:38:34] covenants, the law and grace. He says
[1:38:37] it's divine healing in both of those.
[1:38:39] And what's incredible is the Bible says
[1:38:41] the fowls would come and try to get on
[1:38:44] the sacrifice. And then the Bible says
[1:38:46] Abraham would shoe him off. But the
[1:38:48] Brandham says what was that? It's
[1:38:50] preachers that is keeping devils off of
[1:38:53] divine healing. Hallelujah. And so it's
[1:38:56] God. It was grace letting him know I'm
[1:38:59] going to walk in the covenant. Then the
[1:39:01] Bible would tell us it got dark and and
[1:39:04] I've been just studying all these
[1:39:06] things. Hope it's okay. The Bible says
[1:39:07] it gave us a dark it was night time. It
[1:39:09] got dark and then then it was like a
[1:39:11] furnace. He would go Abraham would go
[1:39:13] into a vision. He would see like a
[1:39:15] furnace. And brother Brandham says the
[1:39:17] darkness meant death. But then the
[1:39:19] furnace it meant hell. But then he would
[1:39:21] tell us, but then there was a lamp, a
[1:39:23] lantern that would walk in the midst of
[1:39:25] it. And he says that's the type of God,
[1:39:28] Christ, walking in the midst of the
[1:39:31] covenant. And he says what he was doing
[1:39:33] was letting Abraham know there's a royal
[1:39:36] seed coming, Jesus Christ, that is going
[1:39:39] to confirm the covenant to your royal
[1:39:42] seed. What was it? It was grace. It was
[1:39:45] grace every step of the way. Now, it's
[1:39:47] grace today picking up the royal seed
[1:39:51] and says, "You're still my pilgrim.
[1:39:53] You're still my stranger. I've called
[1:39:55] you by election just like I called
[1:39:57] Abraham. And yet, I got the same promise
[1:40:00] that you can march on to every promise
[1:40:03] that I've given you. It's been grace
[1:40:06] every step of the way." It was grace.
[1:40:08] And that's incredible. It was grace
[1:40:10] whenever God would come up to would come
[1:40:12] up to Abraham, you know, and would say,
[1:40:14] "I'm your portion." I I think how he put
[1:40:16] it. He would say I'm the almighty God.
[1:40:18] Brother Brandham says what is that
[1:40:20] almighty God? It's El Shadi. He says not
[1:40:23] Elshad. He says that's breast. He says
[1:40:25] El Shadi is the breasted God. And what's
[1:40:28] incredible is brother Brandon would say
[1:40:30] it was the strength giver. He says
[1:40:32] that's the type of the Holy Ghost. He
[1:40:34] says the Holy Ghost is the strength
[1:40:36] giver of almighty God. But then he says
[1:40:38] it's not just the strength giver but
[1:40:40] it's also the the satisfier. Hallelujah.
[1:40:44] So this message has not just given us
[1:40:46] strength, but it has satisfied us that
[1:40:49] we're not looking for anything else.
[1:40:51] It's satisfied us. Brother Brandon would
[1:40:53] ask the question, are we sufficiently
[1:40:55] impressed with the word in our midst?
[1:40:57] And I say yes, I am. I'm satisfied with
[1:41:01] that shouty eye that has been brought to
[1:41:03] me in this generation.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; He's still our shout out in your
[1:41:08] journey. You may feel like you're by
[1:41:10] yourself and alone and and God don't
[1:41:12] hear your prayers. You know, brother
[1:41:14] Brandon would say that that Abraham
[1:41:16] would would crawl in the bosom of a
[1:41:18] shadowy eye and would nurse from him a
[1:41:20] body change. Hallelujah. He felt like he
[1:41:23] couldn't do it. My body's old. And it's
[1:41:25] incredible because the in the book of
[1:41:27] Hebrews, he the the Apostle Paul would
[1:41:30] say that Abraham considered not the
[1:41:33] weakness or the deadness of his body or
[1:41:35] the or the womb of Sarah, but considered
[1:41:38] him faithful. How come he was satisfied?
[1:41:42] He was satisfied that God would do it.
[1:41:44] Every whenever he came up, he came up
[1:41:47] and didn't look like like he could
[1:41:48] fulfill the promise. God was still
[1:41:51] there. And and it's incredible because
[1:41:53] grace will will provide a way in every
[1:41:56] step of the journey. When you feel like
[1:41:57] you can't do it, you know, because Abram
[1:42:00] knew he couldn't do it. He even his name
[1:42:02] represented fatherless. But then brother
[1:42:05] Brown would tell us the name change.
[1:42:07] What was the name change? He said it was
[1:42:09] Elohim coming to Abram. It was Abraham.
[1:42:13] It was God. It was the father. The the
[1:42:15] father of nations coming to the
[1:42:16] fatherless. What was it? It was the
[1:42:18] adoption. It was placing him in a
[1:42:21] position to produce. Brother Brandham
[1:42:23] would tell us that that name change
[1:42:25] conditioned him to produce the promised
[1:42:27] child.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what adoption is.
[1:42:31] It's conditioning you to produce the
[1:42:34] promised child, to produce the word in
[1:42:36] this generation. Hallelujah. But we can
[1:42:39] look at Abram. Abraham, and I won't hold
[1:42:41] you much longer, but Abraham, he he
[1:42:44] would walk by faith. You look at Romans
[1:42:46] 4:20. He staggered not at the promise of
[1:42:49] God through unbelief, but was strong in
[1:42:51] the faith, giving glory to God, and
[1:42:53] being fully persuaded that what he
[1:42:56] promised, he was also to perform.
[1:42:59] Therefore, it was imputed to him for
[1:43:02] righteousness. That's incredible because
[1:43:04] being fully persuaded, that's the reason
[1:43:07] he would stagger not at the promises of
[1:43:09] God because he was fully persuaded.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. Too many times we're not fully
[1:43:15] persuaded.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; And since we're not fully persuaded,
[1:43:18] we're staggering. We're we're not tied.
[1:43:20] We're not anchored to an absolute. And
[1:43:23] when doubt and unbelief comes, we're
[1:43:24] blown back and forth. But in order to be
[1:43:27] fully in order to stagger not at the
[1:43:29] promises of God, you got to be fully
[1:43:32] persuaded
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; that once you're fully persuaded and the
[1:43:36] reason Abraham was fully persuaded was
[1:43:38] we we brother would teach us that there
[1:43:40] was three covenants, right? The covenant
[1:43:42] between God and Adam which Adam broke.
[1:43:45] The covenant between God and Noah which
[1:43:46] Noah would break, you know, and then
[1:43:48] there was the covenant between Abraham
[1:43:50] and God which was an unconditional
[1:43:52] covenant. Not what you can do but what I
[1:43:54] can do. That's the reason Abraham could
[1:43:57] rest. He could be fully persuaded
[1:43:59] because the covenant was not hinging on
[1:44:02] what I can do. It's hinging on what he's
[1:44:05] already done.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we can rest in
[1:44:09] the promises of God. It's not hinging on
[1:44:11] what you can do or how good you can do
[1:44:13] or the works you can do. If you if you
[1:44:15] can speak in tongues or or if you can
[1:44:17] dance the aisles or shout and run across
[1:44:20] the pews, but it's only can you believe.
[1:44:23] Can you believe what God has already
[1:44:25] given you? Not what you can do. It's
[1:44:28] what God can already what he's already
[1:44:30] done. Brother Brandon would tell us the
[1:44:32] basis of our faith is the covenant is an
[1:44:35] everlasting covenant. So he was
[1:44:38] persuaded because it was an everlasting
[1:44:41] covenant. And it's incredible because I
[1:44:43] believe we can rest and and I and I'll
[1:44:45] close on this thought here. I believe we
[1:44:47] can rest upon the promises of God.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:51] In order to be a pilgrim, you have to
[1:44:53] know what you're after, you can achieve.
[1:44:55] And I and I hope this is all coming
[1:44:56] together this morning. You have to know
[1:44:58] what you're after, you can achieve. Cuz
[1:45:01] if not, you're going to stop in the
[1:45:03] middle of the way.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; You're going to stop in the middle of
[1:45:06] the journey. But the Brandon would tell
[1:45:07] us in order to be perseverant, right? He
[1:45:09] would say, you have to know what you're
[1:45:11] after and you have to know if you can
[1:45:13] achieve it or not.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Right? If you know you can't achieve it,
[1:45:16] you're never going to be persevering.
[1:45:18] But I believe we can rest in the
[1:45:20] promises of God. Brother Brandon would
[1:45:22] say this here in perfect faith. He would
[1:45:24] say, "His spirit is here. He knows you.
[1:45:27] You've got one thing to do. That's to
[1:45:29] believe it and to accept it." And it's
[1:45:32] incredible because he would say this at
[1:45:34] the beginning of a prayer line. And then
[1:45:36] he would stop and would say, "Jim, do
[1:45:39] you believe he knows about that baby
[1:45:41] that took fever a few hours before you
[1:45:43] left? It was 105." And so, Brother
[1:45:46] Brandham didn't just know the guy's
[1:45:48] name. He knew he had a child. He didn't
[1:45:50] just know the child, but he knew he had
[1:45:52] a fever. And he knew the exact
[1:45:54] temperature of that fever. And he says,
[1:45:56] "Do you believe he will heal it?" And
[1:45:59] what's incredible was, Brother Brandham
[1:46:01] would be conditioning them to receive
[1:46:03] this. Before he ever discerned a life,
[1:46:06] he would say, "You've got one thing to
[1:46:08] do. That's accept it and believe it."
[1:46:11] So, you're not trying to work up a
[1:46:12] vision. All you're doing is accepting
[1:46:15] and believing what the vision has
[1:46:17] already said. Another place, brother
[1:46:19] Brandham, he he would he would talk
[1:46:21] about nervousness because many times if
[1:46:24] we nervousness and fear makes us uneasy
[1:46:27] where we can't rest in the promises of
[1:46:29] God and brother Brandon would talk about
[1:46:31] nervousness and in one place he at the
[1:46:34] beginning of a prayer line, he would
[1:46:36] stop and would say, "I'm waiting for
[1:46:38] him." And he says, "If he shows up, he
[1:46:40] he'll know your needs. He can discern
[1:46:42] your heart. And he he would stop and we
[1:46:44] say, "Don't be nervous now. Be
[1:46:46] reverent." He says, "Don't he says,
[1:46:47] "You'll never get anything if you're
[1:46:49] nervous." And it's incredible because
[1:46:52] the devil wants us to become nervous.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; He wants us to become fearful of the
[1:46:57] promises of God or where we'll be
[1:46:59] disappointed. You know, brother Brandon
[1:47:00] was saying in one place, you're scared
[1:47:02] it won't happen. You're nervous that
[1:47:04] that you're going to be disappointed if
[1:47:06] you actually step out in faith and and
[1:47:08] believe that that your child can be
[1:47:09] saved or believe God can heal your body
[1:47:11] or or believe God can change your life
[1:47:13] and deliver you from drugs or alcohol or
[1:47:16] whatever it is. And it's fear that is
[1:47:18] keeping you from just resting in what
[1:47:20] God promised that you can achieve. And
[1:47:23] so, Brother Brandham stops. He says
[1:47:25] nervousness will never get you anywhere.
[1:47:27] But he says just be reverent. And what I
[1:47:29] think is powerful is there's a
[1:47:31] difference between godly fear and the
[1:47:34] fear that the devil brings. Right?
[1:47:36] Because the Bible tells us the beginning
[1:47:38] of knowledge is the fear of God. I
[1:47:39] believe I think that's what it is. And
[1:47:41] the devil comes and he wants you to
[1:47:43] become afraid of God. Right? But the
[1:47:46] brand tells the difference. He says the
[1:47:48] fear of the Lord is not being afraid of
[1:47:50] God. It reverence God.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; So the devil wants you to be afraid of
[1:47:54] God if I make a mistake or this or that.
[1:47:56] and he puts fear upon you where you
[1:47:58] can't rest in the promise of God. So,
[1:48:01] brother Brown in this prayer line says
[1:48:03] don't be nervous but be reverent and
[1:48:06] nervousness is a form of fear. So, in
[1:48:08] other words, you're not fearing it's not
[1:48:11] going to happen but you're reverencing
[1:48:13] the Lord that you know he can do it.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want to do anything that you
[1:48:17] know and hope this is okay. I remember
[1:48:19] as a teenager that that anytime mom
[1:48:22] would say, "Hey, dad want you." I would
[1:48:23] get freaked out. I'm sure y'all know
[1:48:26] what I'm talking about. Hey, Dad, I want
[1:48:27] you. What did I do wrong? It's not that
[1:48:29] I was scared of him. There was a respect
[1:48:31] there, right? I didn't want to do
[1:48:33] anything that that that would would not
[1:48:35] get his approval. And that's the respect
[1:48:37] towards God, right? We don't want to do
[1:48:40] anything that brings this approval from
[1:48:43] almighty God. So, we're not afraid of
[1:48:45] him. We're respecting him. We're
[1:48:47] reverencing him. And where there's a
[1:48:49] reverence, so in this par, brother
[1:48:51] Brandon would say, don't be nervous.
[1:48:52] Just read the be reverent. And then he
[1:48:54] says, "Oh, there he is." He says, "Now
[1:48:56] he's here." What was it? He got them
[1:48:58] from being afraid of the supernatural,
[1:49:00] afraid of disappointing God to
[1:49:03] respecting God. Then God can walk in the
[1:49:06] midst.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then, Brother Brandon
[1:49:10] said, "What? This one over here has this
[1:49:11] problem. This has that problem." What
[1:49:13] was it? He got them from being afraid to
[1:49:16] respecting. And then the word of God
[1:49:18] could come and speak to heart. And I
[1:49:21] believe that's the attitude of the
[1:49:22] bride, we're respecting God. We're not
[1:49:24] afraid of God.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; We're not afraid of God. And brother
[1:49:29] Brown would talk about how how that
[1:49:32] whenever the disciples was was upon the
[1:49:34] boat and the the storms was coming up
[1:49:36] and this is a powerful quote. He would
[1:49:38] say they looked and seen Jesus and he
[1:49:40] says it was their only hope and they
[1:49:42] were afraid of him.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; ain't that powerful? The only hope they
[1:49:47] had for survival was coming their
[1:49:50] direction. And they was afraid of him.
[1:49:52] Too many times we're afraid to step out
[1:49:54] on the promises of God. Afraid to step
[1:49:57] out on the message. Afraid to step out
[1:49:59] and say, "This is what I believe."
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; So, we're not afraid of what we believe.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; We're not afraid. We're standing firmly
[1:50:06] upon the promises of God. Let our
[1:50:08] musicians come this morning.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; We're not afraid. Brother Brandham must
[1:50:12] say now perfect faith just like perfect
[1:50:14] love casts out all fear.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; And so we're resting in the promises of
[1:50:19] God.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; That's that that's something that we all
[1:50:22] have to do as Christians. And I and I
[1:50:23] know this was simple this morning,
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; but I hope it was okay that we have to
[1:50:27] rest. We're sold because there's no we
[1:50:30] can't rest in politics. We can't rest in
[1:50:33] in our social standings. We can't rest
[1:50:35] in President Trump or President Biden.
[1:50:38] We can't rest him in
[1:50:40] the pope. There's only one place we can
[1:50:43] rest. That's in heavens and earth will
[1:50:45] pass away.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; But my word will never fail.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; That's where we're resting at. Brother
[1:50:50] Brandon would tell us that the great
[1:50:52] miracle of Noah's day was Noah being
[1:50:55] able to rest in the ark.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? The miracle wasn't
[1:50:59] the ark. The miracle was him being able
[1:51:02] to rest in the ark.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The miracle is you resting
[1:51:06] in this message in this generation
[1:51:09] resting that God has promised. And my
[1:51:11] brother Brown, I'm going to talk about
[1:51:12] Ruth and then I'm closing. He would talk
[1:51:14] about Ruth and would say, "If Ruth could
[1:51:17] have only found favor in the eyes of
[1:51:18] Boaz, then she could rest." And we know
[1:51:21] what happened. She found favor in the
[1:51:23] eyes of Boaz. Then she could rest. And
[1:51:26] we have found favor in the eyes of
[1:51:27] Almighty God. And we're resting. Let's
[1:51:30] bow our heads this morning.
[1:51:34] Dear gracious heavenly father,
[1:51:38] Lord, I ask that
[1:51:40] you would take the the pieces this
[1:51:42] morning, Lord, and bring it together in
[1:51:45] the hearts of your people.
[1:51:48] But Lord, we're all upon a journey.
[1:51:51] We're a pilgrim. We're a stranger. We
[1:51:53] don't fit in.
[1:51:55] But Lord, we're not left alone. You've
[1:51:58] elected us for this. You've called us
[1:52:01] for this generation.
[1:52:04] You've called us. You You place trust in
[1:52:06] us.
[1:52:07] And Lord, it's because of that trust we
[1:52:10] want to reverence you. We don't want to
[1:52:12] bring disapproval.
[1:52:14] We don't want to bring
[1:52:17] dishonor to your name or to this word.
[1:52:21] But Lord, we're striving,
[1:52:23] Lord, and we're thankful for the grace
[1:52:25] that you've given us. Lord,
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; you've given us a message that says we
[1:52:29] can. We're the rapturing generation, but
[1:52:31] you've also given us a rapturing grace
[1:52:34] where we can just rest in it.
[1:52:36] We're riding on it this morning. Lord,
[1:52:39] if there's some here this morning
[1:52:42] that ain't resting, they're still
[1:52:44] fighting in their own works. They're
[1:52:46] trying to work their way into it. Lord,
[1:52:49] may there be a day of rest for them. May
[1:52:51] there be a such a dying out to your word
[1:52:55] that they can accept the invitation that
[1:52:58] us knocking on their door today. We love
[1:53:01] you father in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Oh all
[1:53:15] is well.
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:21] We have heard
[1:53:25] the message.
[1:53:30] All is well.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Let me stand and sing it this morning.
[1:53:38] For there is
[1:53:42] a place,
[1:53:44] a perfect
[1:53:46] rest
[1:53:48] behind
[1:53:50] the end.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; So
[1:53:57] rest
[1:53:58] little bride.
[1:54:01] rest
[1:54:03] for all is well.
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Can we sing it again as we turn it to
[1:54:09] our pastor now?
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:19] All
[1:54:21] is well.
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:27] We have heard
[1:54:31] the message shalom.
[1:54:35] All is well.
[1:54:38] [Music]
[1:54:43] Well, for there is
[1:54:47] a place,
[1:54:49] a perfect
[1:54:51] rest
[1:54:53] behind
[1:54:55] the inner
[1:54:56] ve.
[1:54:58] Oh,
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:02] little bit of brown.
[1:55:06] For all
[1:55:09] is well.
[1:55:13] Aren't you glad that all is well?
[1:55:17] We've
[1:55:19] There's a lot of
[1:55:23] religious voices. There's so many
[1:55:25] voices. just so many.
[1:55:28] And it's no wonder that the Bible
[1:55:31] prophesies
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:34] that the day when Jesus comes, he's he's
[1:55:36] going to be asking the question, will he
[1:55:38] asked the question, when I do come,
[1:55:42] will I find faith on the earth?
[1:55:46] So the question is
[1:55:48] faith. Now we understand that the Bible
[1:55:50] says faith comes by hearing and hearing
[1:55:54] understanding
[1:55:55] not just hearing the word because many
[1:55:57] will hear but faith comes by
[1:56:01] understanding.
[1:56:03] So
[1:56:06] the question is that Jesus was saying,
[1:56:08] "I'm going to return, but when I return,
[1:56:14] will there be a faith?"
[1:56:17] And a faith is that burning anticipation
[1:56:20] for a promise, burning anticipation for
[1:56:23] God's word to be fulfilled.
[1:56:27] But then the scripture says in
[1:56:29] Revelations that when he comes it'll be
[1:56:33] a day where it is lukewarm. He says
[1:56:38] you're He says
[1:56:41] I wish you were cold. I I wish you were
[1:56:43] just cold ranked sinners or
[1:56:47] hot on fire for me. But he says but
[1:56:52] lukewarm. I can't stand lukewarm
[1:56:55] condition.
[1:56:56] I wish you were in or you were out. But
[1:57:00] to but to be religious and then to
[1:57:03] harbor things in your heart or to be
[1:57:06] religious and and not not not live fire
[1:57:10] for the word.
[1:57:13] He said it's like you're lukewarm. I'll
[1:57:15] spew you out of my mouth. He says, "For
[1:57:18] you say that you are increased with
[1:57:21] goods and you have need of nothing and
[1:57:25] that you're all but he says, but I say
[1:57:28] you're blind, you're wretched, you're
[1:57:31] miserable, and you don't even know it."
[1:57:35] So, this is the condition that the
[1:57:37] church is going to be in before Jesus
[1:57:40] comes.
[1:57:42] This is this is going to be the
[1:57:44] condition that everyone is just all
[1:57:46] religious. Everyone's got their own
[1:57:48] thing going.
[1:57:52] But he's also promised that there would
[1:57:55] be a restoration. Joel says there would
[1:58:00] be a restoration.
[1:58:02] He says there were the there were the He
[1:58:06] says the the the four insects that would
[1:58:08] eat up the tree. Y'all remember that?
[1:58:10] the caterpillar and the locust and the
[1:58:12] palm worm and the polorm. The these
[1:58:15] would all eat up the tree. But then the
[1:58:18] scripture says in the book of Joel, I
[1:58:21] will restore saith the Lord. I'm going
[1:58:25] to restore.
[1:58:27] So here it is. We've we're we're in the
[1:58:30] laxness
[1:58:32] and and the whole world is claiming to
[1:58:34] be but there's no one really with
[1:58:36] fervent fire or there's not very many
[1:58:38] people. But there's going to be an
[1:58:41] elect. And that people is not going to
[1:58:45] just be satisfied. Oh, I've got a Bible
[1:58:47] and I and I believe in God. That will
[1:58:50] not get you in a rapture.
[1:58:52] Oh, I go to church. I've been baptized.
[1:58:55] So, that's all it that will not get you
[1:58:57] into the kingdom of heaven.
[1:58:59] God is coming with his Holy Spirit and
[1:59:04] he's drawing our hearts and he's saying,
[1:59:06] "Listen, come out of that lukewarm
[1:59:08] condition. Come out of this. Well, I'm
[1:59:11] just fine." You've got to get fervent.
[1:59:13] He wants you to get fervent with his
[1:59:15] word. And so, what does he do? He'll
[1:59:18] send a messenger just like he did. He
[1:59:20] sent a Moses and declaring, "Amen.
[1:59:24] You've got to come out of Egypt. you
[1:59:26] belong in that other land. Come out."
[1:59:29] And they didn't want to come out. And
[1:59:31] then God be to allow pressure and things
[1:59:34] to come. And before you know it, Amen.
[1:59:37] They begin to cry out, "Okay, because
[1:59:39] God had another land for them."
[1:59:42] Hallelujah. He sent a Noah. And Anoah
[1:59:44] says, "Listen, you've got to get fervent
[1:59:46] about this. Get into this ark. God's
[1:59:48] fixing to strike. God judgment is fixing
[1:59:50] to come." He said to John the Baptist,
[1:59:53] "Listen, you got to come out of Judaism.
[1:59:55] There's coming one. The son of God is
[1:59:57] coming. And you've got to hear that.
[2:00:00] Amen. And so is it in this day. He says,
[2:00:03] "Behold, I'm going to send you an
[2:00:05] Elijah. I'm going to send you an Elijah,
[2:00:07] the prophet." And you've got to hear
[2:00:08] that voice.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Be fervent about it. Be fervent about
[2:00:12] it. He's going to take you back to the
[2:00:13] Bible. Now, be fervent with this belief
[2:00:15] in the Bible. Listen, my words are still
[2:00:18] true.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; My Bible is still true, but listen. Be
[2:00:22] fervent.
[2:00:25] And he's done that in this day.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm glad that we can look at
[2:00:29] the Bible and not with the old Amen. the
[2:00:32] old stale eyes, but God's come in our
[2:00:36] generation to say, "Hey,
[2:00:39] I want you to really look at it because
[2:00:40] my word is true. And I'm going to
[2:00:42] rapture. And I want you to be ready."
[2:00:45] Friends, I'm glad to say that I'm a
[2:00:47] stranger and a sojourer in this land.
[2:00:50] I'm glad that I've heard something say,
[2:00:52] "Wendle,
[2:00:54] Wendle, wake up, wake up, Wendle. Don't
[2:00:57] sit there dead in a pew. Don't sit there
[2:01:00] in dead religion. Wake up, Wendle. I'm
[2:01:03] I'm going to rapture you. You got to
[2:01:05] start looking at things according to
[2:01:07] this Bible. Come back to the Bible, for
[2:01:10] my Bible is true." Not what you think,
[2:01:13] not what you want to accept, but come
[2:01:16] back and accept it. Amen. And I say
[2:01:19] today, I'm so glad that God is calling
[2:01:22] us. Aren't you glad that you're not one
[2:01:24] of those little water spiders caught in
[2:01:26] the net? Aren't you glad you're not one
[2:01:28] of those turtles or snakes in the net?
[2:01:30] That when God came after you, he came
[2:01:33] after he came after the rainbow trout.
[2:01:36] He's come after the elect. He come after
[2:01:39] you. Amen. The net didn't he didn't
[2:01:42] throw the net out for the snakes. steaks
[2:01:44] got in it. But he came for the fish. And
[2:01:48] I say today that God's got some trophy
[2:01:51] fish in here. Some rainbow trout in
[2:01:54] here. And God says, "These are my
[2:01:55] trophies. This is what I've been after."
[2:01:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Aren't you glad
[2:02:02] for that here today? Amen. The Holy
[2:02:05] Spirit. So I say, "Come out of her, my
[2:02:07] people." What What was that? Now
[2:02:09] remember, it was in the last angel's
[2:02:12] message that the scream come out in the
[2:02:14] book of Revelations. Come out of her, my
[2:02:18] people, and I will be your God. Now, who
[2:02:22] is this her she was talking about?
[2:02:25] It was that church. If you were to look
[2:02:28] there in in in the book of Revelations,
[2:02:30] the 17th chapter, you would find that
[2:02:33] there would be a church that would be
[2:02:36] calling itself the bride of Christ. But
[2:02:39] but but God says, "Oh no, she's full of
[2:02:42] iniquity. That church would be full of
[2:02:45] of blasphemous names. That church would
[2:02:48] be," he says, "But the cry was, come out
[2:02:52] of her because I am fixing to call you
[2:02:55] into a rapture." So, I just want to let
[2:02:57] you know here this morning, you're not
[2:02:59] sitting in this church building just to
[2:03:01] be setting. We've got an ambition. It's
[2:03:04] time to go home.
[2:03:09] I know discouragement comes. I know we
[2:03:12] fight. And I just want to tell you, keep
[2:03:14] on fighting. If you've got a if you've
[2:03:18] got to fight every every moment of your
[2:03:20] day and every day of your life, you keep
[2:03:22] on fighting because you're a son and
[2:03:24] daughter of God. Hallelujah. Satan
[2:03:26] wouldn't be fighting you so hard today
[2:03:28] if if you weren't a son or a daughter of
[2:03:30] God. But you are a son and you are a
[2:03:33] daughter. So keep on fighting. Get some
[2:03:35] ambition about you and keep on pressing
[2:03:37] because that one that called you will
[2:03:39] not fail you. Well, can you say amen?
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. I want a heart that is
[2:03:46] humble. Amen. A heart I want I want to
[2:03:49] be real. I want to be right. Let my
[2:03:52] heart be pure, undefiled. All is well.
[2:03:56] Hallelujah. Don't mean to get back up
[2:03:58] and preach another sermon, but man, that
[2:03:59] was that was good preaching this
[2:04:01] morning. I have heard
[2:04:04] the message. Shalom. What is shalom?
[2:04:07] Peace.
[2:04:09] All is well. That's what Jesus said.
[2:04:13] Shalom. The peace that I give you.
[2:04:17] For there is
[2:04:20] a place. Where is that place?
[2:04:24] It's his word.
[2:04:27] We're just believing you, Lord.
[2:04:30] We're believing you. Oh,
[2:04:34] rest,
[2:04:35] little brow.
[2:04:38] Rest
[2:04:39] for all
[2:04:41] is well.
[2:04:43] All is well.
[2:04:48] Is there someone in here today that
[2:04:50] maybe
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; not everything is well for you with your
[2:04:55] soul? Maybe you've been religious, but
[2:04:57] you hear a voice saying, "I need to come
[2:04:59] out. I need to come higher." We want to
[2:05:02] give you that opportunity here this
[2:05:04] morning.
[2:05:06] If you feel the need, the tug, if
[2:05:09] father's voice is saying, "Come on
[2:05:12] home."
[2:05:14] Oh, for there is
[2:05:18] a place
[2:05:20] of per
[2:05:23] rest

[2:06:11] Greater is he
[2:06:15] is greater
[2:06:19] than he that is in the world. Oh yes,
