[38:38] his Commandments upon the bed post and

[39:45] to Psalms 147 and verse
[39:55] three Psalms 1 47 and verse
[40:02] three said he Health the broken in
[40:05] heart and bindeth up their wounds if I
[40:09] also con turn to a few more Psalm 17 and
[40:12] verse

[40:35] medicine but a broken Spirit dth the
[40:39] bones one more then I'll let you have

[41:22] part of the service Lord just bless the
[41:25] reading of your word and your precious
[41:27] and lovely name we pray amen you may be
[41:30] seated here tonight I appreciate Dad
[41:34] singing his song I haven't heard that in
[41:37] quite some time but that is going to be
[41:39] my topic for tonight is something that
[41:42] I've been dealing with in my own heart
[41:45] for some time now it's the healing for
[41:48] every wound the healing for every wound
[41:50] and some of us have had broken bones I
[41:54] would imagine some of us have had
[41:56] stitches
[41:57] um seeing my my cousin have that that
[42:01] sledding accident and the stitches that
[42:03] it took place to to to to try to heal
[42:06] the wound that she had and you know some
[42:09] of us might have even had a gunshot
[42:10] wound and I was preaching in Arkansas
[42:12] and I hit on that I asked if somebody
[42:15] has ever had a gunshot wound
[42:17] here and I had a person actually raise
[42:19] his hand he's like I've been shot his
[42:22] wife yelled out yeah
[42:23] twice like wow okay so there's people
[42:26] that I have have wounds in their bodies
[42:29] but the wounds and the healing that I
[42:31] want to address tonight and Lord will
[42:33] and I want to go along my testimony if I
[42:36] may but it goes beyond the physical it
[42:40] goes beyond your body and it goes to the
[42:45] sense of the spirit the realm of the
[42:48] memory in your in your conscience and
[42:50] your affections they are the hidden
[42:52] wounds that are within our hearts they
[42:54] are wounds that that can't be stitched
[42:57] they can't be bandaged they they can't
[43:00] be stapled they can't be taken care of
[43:02] with with the natural tools that we have
[43:05] in this world today and we like to talk
[43:08] about old physical wounds like like
[43:10] there's some crazy thing that took place
[43:13] to get this wound and seeing Simeon you
[43:15] know with his scar and and the story
[43:18] that he has from getting scoped you know
[43:20] as young men we can tell a dramatic
[43:22] story and how how heroic we were to get
[43:26] that scar
[43:27] amen right but it just takes a split
[43:32] second recollection of a hidden womb
[43:34] within us that can cause pain it maybe
[43:38] memories of abuse in your life maybe
[43:40] it's memories of ridicule or or
[43:42] criticism maybe it could be neglect it
[43:45] could be hatred it could be physical
[43:47] abuse that took place it maybe emotional
[43:50] abuse maybe even spiritual abuse that
[43:53] has taken place where do you get hidden
[43:56] wombs you get them every where you get
[43:58] it through Society or through parents or
[44:00] through family children brothers sisters
[44:03] Aunts Uncles your wife your husband
[44:05] friends acquaintances church members
[44:08] even pastors one thing is for certain
[44:12] everybody has or has had a hidden scar
[44:16] an emotional scar in your life or at
[44:19] least one you may be masking it by
[44:22] wearing a fake facade around people but
[44:25] deep down inside your heart
[44:27] you're hurting there's something that
[44:29] has taken place that has traumatized
[44:31] your life ain't that right another thing
[44:36] is certain emotional wounds take longer
[44:38] to heal Than Physical wounds it says a
[44:41] soldier comes back from war and he has
[44:44] shrapnel in his body he's limping he's
[44:46] got bandages on his right arm and around
[44:49] his head give it six to9 months he'll be
[44:52] physically okay but the emotional wounds
[44:55] from the ravages of War will be with him
[44:58] for a long long time this story is being
[45:02] told by the grandson's perspective it
[45:04] says here my grandfather on my mother's
[45:06] side fought in World War II in the South
[45:09] Pacific he says I remember growing up
[45:13] excuse
[45:15] me he saids I would stay at their house
[45:18] quite often and on a few occasions I
[45:21] remember him having nightmares of
[45:22] killing Japanese soldiers he was in the
[45:25] 70 that was in the 7s and the war was in
[45:28] the' 40s just recently he had one of his
[45:31] legs amputated and during recovery from
[45:34] surgery someone walked into his hospital
[45:36] room and he was hiding behind his bed
[45:40] hiding from Japanese soldiers he was in
[45:43] his 80s and the war was 60 years ago so
[45:46] we understand that emotional scars can
[45:49] last a
[45:50] long long time but no matter the source
[45:54] of the scar there is healing for every
[45:57] wound how many can say Amen to that
[46:00] Psalms 11981 says my soul fainteth for
[46:04] thou for thy salvation but I hope in thy
[46:07] word my eyes fail for Thy word saying
[46:10] when will thou comfort me Psalms 3418
[46:15] says the Lord is nigh unto them that are
[46:18] of a broken spirit and saveth such as be
[46:22] of a contrite spirit the ESV version
[46:26] says there the Lord is near to the
[46:29] Brokenhearted and he saves the crushed
[46:33] in spirit there is healing for every
[46:35] hurt he is the Hope for every need amen
[46:39] we heard that this morning he is Jehovah
[46:41] Gyra he will provide Jehovah Nissi the
[46:45] Lord that gives victory of Deliverance
[46:48] Jehovah sha the everpresent one he is
[46:51] Jehovah Shalom the Lord is our peace and
[46:54] in Exodus 15 it says I am
[46:57] Jehovah Rafa which means I am the god
[47:00] that Health thee Psalms 147 and3 says he
[47:04] heals the broken in heart and he binds
[47:08] up their wounds you see our sin
[47:11] situation required a savior but our
[47:14] emotional situation requires a Healer
[47:18] there's times in our life we don't
[47:19] realize that we need a healing from a
[47:23] past
[47:24] wound there's times in our life that we
[47:27] thought we have gotten over something in
[47:28] our life and then something triggers it
[47:31] to allow it to resurface again you
[47:34] thought you were past a sin or or a
[47:36] mistake you thought you got forgiveness
[47:38] in some area or you thought you got past
[47:40] the pain and the hurt of a situation in
[47:42] your life until something brings it back
[47:45] up again and you realize you've never
[47:47] dealt with that
[47:49] situation hello
[47:51] somebody we can repent and be born again
[47:54] of water and spirit and that takes care
[47:57] of our sin situation but what about the
[48:00] scars in our hurts inside God just
[48:04] doesn't want to take care of our sin
[48:06] situation but he wants to heal our
[48:09] hearts hello somebody God says that I
[48:13] can forgive you in an instant and I can
[48:15] wash away your sins I can fill you with
[48:19] my spirit but there's so much more that
[48:21] I want to do I want to heal your hurts
[48:24] and I want to heal your wounds and I
[48:26] want to give you a joy and a peace and a
[48:29] happiness that you've never experienced
[48:31] in your life let me tell you something
[48:34] as long as you continue to hide hurts
[48:36] within your heart you're never going to
[48:39] truly experience what God has for you
[48:42] you can always wear a smile and you
[48:44] always think you're You're great and
[48:46] you're fine and you're happy until
[48:48] something triggers it then you go back
[48:50] to a place that you thought you were rid
[48:54] of too many times we let God deal with
[48:58] the sin part of our life but we never
[49:00] let him deal with the hurts and that
[49:04] always leads to frustrations because we
[49:06] still have wounds let me tell you
[49:08] something these wounds I'm speaking from
[49:11] experience here these dark scars these
[49:14] hurts if they're not taken care of you
[49:17] will never have a complete
[49:20] breakthrough hello somebody you say
[49:22] brother kby that can't happen brother

[49:27] the message the second Miracle he begins
[49:30] to Desert a lady and she is dealing with
[49:33] a nervous condition and she also has
[49:36] cancer and he continues to deal with her
[49:39] and he tells her she had a dog scare as

[50:56] certain lady married to a man by the
[50:59] name of brother
[51:00] huff and this couple had a set of twins
[51:03] brother Brenham says these twins were
[51:05] staunch
[51:07] Christians and brother Brandon brings
[51:08] out the story in the message in
[51:10] uncertain sound he says one little girl
[51:13] going to school she got a complex the
[51:16] girl tells her the girls tell her well
[51:19] why don't you smoke like we do and you
[51:21] think you're better than we are why

[51:37] serving Christ they don't want to let
[51:40] them go ahead but the other one she be
[51:43] to think oh maybe I could do something
[51:47] and she built a complex and got nervous
[51:50] brother the brandom says here she went
[51:53] insane and they had to put her in an
[51:55] institution for two years complexes will
[51:59] destroy
[52:01] you emotional scars of abuse and things
[52:05] that ain't handled will destroy you do
[52:08] you not realize that there could be
[52:10] situations in your life that affect you
[52:12] as an adult that happened as a
[52:15] child come on
[52:17] somebody fight
[52:20] complexes if I wonder if people love me
[52:22] wonder if I'm ever going to be good
[52:24] enough wondering if I'm ever going to
[52:25] get a healing in my body all because of
[52:28] something that took
[52:29] place as a
[52:33] child I
[52:35] struggled for the longest time with
[52:38] certain family members because of the
[52:40] stuff that I've done years
[52:42] ago and every time I was around them I
[52:45] wondered if they loved me and I I
[52:47] wondered if they have forgiven me how
[52:50] many's ever been
[52:53] there you know what fixed it is becoming
[52:56] completely
[52:57] honest and say Lord I need your help you
[53:00] know I was driving
[53:02] back I was on the road with my family
[53:04] and I got a call from this family member
[53:06] it happened 20 years ago but it still
[53:09] haunted me and has still affected me I
[53:12] always wondered if they had forgiven me
[53:14] 20 years ago things that happened and I
[53:17] got a call just randomly out of the blue
[53:20] from this individual saying Colby just
[53:22] letting you know I forgive you
[53:27] randomly out of the blue 20 years of
[53:29] wandering if if if if if I've gotten
[53:32] over this 20 years in a random call you
[53:37] can ask my wife I woke her up crying she
[53:38] was sleeping I woke her up crying saying
[53:41] I got my answer I didn't
[53:44] know come on somebody
[54:00] God can
[54:03] heal a lot of times as church
[54:06] members we can Mi we can mistake feeling
[54:10] for
[54:11] healing hello
[54:13] somebody we can mistake us getting a
[54:16] feeling here and if falling upon our
[54:19] spirit map we can Rejoice we can shout
[54:22] we can
[54:23] dance but we never truly allow God God
[54:26] to come down deep within the
[54:29] heart we we we we mistake emotions for a
[54:33] complete delivery Deliverance hello
[54:38] somebody and because of it we live our
[54:42] life on a roller
[54:44] coaster by midweek we're up here we're
[54:47] doing great we feel like we've gotten
[54:48] something from the Lord we're doing
[54:50] fantastic by Sunday what happens you're
[54:53] back down again then you go to church
[54:56] and you feel something within your heart
[54:59] we have based our
[55:01] deliverance on feelings that's why we
[55:05] don't base our Salvation on feelings we
[55:08] got to know that we know that we know
[55:10] that we know that we know that we have
[55:12] the Holy Ghost within our heart because
[55:14] on the good times we praise him on the
[55:18] bad times when we don't feel nothing we
[55:20] praise him because our salvation is
[55:23] based more than what our body is telling
[55:25] us
[55:27] we base it upon something that has a
[55:29] sure
[55:31] Foundation we don't base it off emotions
[55:34] even though emotions is great I want to
[55:37] cry in the presence of the Lord and I
[55:38] want to be able to dance in the presence
[55:40] of the Lord but we can't base what we
[55:43] have On Emotion because emotions will be
[55:45] like this a roller
[55:47] coaster hello somebody maybe I'm just
[55:50] preaching to myself
[55:56] let me skip some of this
[56:02] here brother brandom continues with his
[56:05] story
[56:06] here and he's talking to that twin girl
[56:09] and then saying Asylum he said I keep
[56:11] talking with her oh but the grace of God
[56:15] he did just in a few minutes the Holy
[56:17] Ghost begin to move
[56:20] him I said Margaret you don't know me
[56:23] but I said all your life said you been
[56:26] big enough to know about boys you've had
[56:28] in your mind you're going to marry a
[56:30] preacher you wanted to marry a preacher
[56:34] and she started to smile he said that
[56:36] caught see I seen the Holy Spirit had it
[56:40] then I said thus saith the Lord it is
[56:48] over what took
[56:50] place was that Spirit had to be
[56:54] identified they had to get to the root
[56:57] of the problem to realize that there is
[56:59] things in her life as a child that has
[57:03] triggered complexes that's triggered
[57:05] emotion that has kept her insane but
[57:07] once brother brand identified it and was
[57:10] able to pinpoint what took place what
[57:12] happened he can say it is
[57:20] over I found
[57:24] out that you can never truly get help
[57:27] from God unless you first ask him for
[57:31] help God wants to
[57:34] help God wants to give you a deliverance
[57:37] and a peace like you've never had but
[57:38] you got to get to a point of desperation
[57:41] to where God I I need
[57:48] you you've got to get it out the Bible
[57:50] talks about the problem of stuffing it
[57:54] inside Psalms 3 in verse one says I will
[57:58] take heed to my ways that I sin not with
[58:01] my
[58:02] tongue and I will mouth and I will keep
[58:05] my mouth with a bridal while the wicked
[58:09] is before me I was dumb with
[58:12] silence I held my peace even from good
[58:14] and my sorrow was stirred my heart was
[58:17] hot within me while I was musing the
[58:20] fire then I
[58:22] spake with my tongue he saying holding
[58:25] on to hurts
[58:26] it's like carrying hot colds within your
[58:29] heart hdden wounds and you try to stuff
[58:31] them down they don't heal they Fest her
[58:35] and pushing her hert aside doesn't get
[58:37] rid of it it only makes it worse I hope
[58:41] this is
[58:42] okay David said while I kept things to
[58:46] myself I felt weak inside he said I moan
[58:50] all the day low he said it's emotionally
[58:53] draining ain't that right
[58:57] finding out that people deal I'm almost
[59:00] through people deal with things or hurts
[59:02] in different ways there are some people
[59:05] that try to forget
[59:07] it there are some people that CH to
[59:09] drugs and
[59:10] alcohol some just turn their back on God
[59:13] and question what they
[59:16] believe people do different things but
[59:19] none of them truly
[59:21] work I found out that hurt people hurt
[59:25] people
[59:28] hurt people hurt
[59:31] people and when a person is so hurt deep
[59:36] inside they buil an emotional wall
[59:39] around that area and because they never
[59:41] want to be hurt like that again so they
[59:44] put up defenses around that area I look
[59:48] this up and it's called a defense
[59:49] mechanism you watch an
[59:51] individual that has been hurt in the
[59:54] past and you watch watch how they are
[59:56] happy and they're lifting up their hands
[59:58] in church and they're sociable and all
[1:00:00] of a sudden this person begins to change
[1:00:04] someone that was once happy is now
[1:00:06] depressed someone that was once a social
[1:00:08] butterfly is now a recluse they are
[1:00:10] pulling away from church get togethers
[1:00:15] they don't want to visit family
[1:00:17] anymore and when they do come to church
[1:00:20] they're no longer allowing themselves to
[1:00:22] be free in
[1:00:23] worship when a person is going through
[1:00:26] this and something triggers in their
[1:00:28] mind what happens they run to a place
[1:00:31] that makes them feel
[1:00:33] safe hello somebody you run to
[1:00:37] addictions to give a temporary peace
[1:00:40] really ain't that what addiction
[1:00:42] is they make you feel good for the
[1:00:45] moment but it don't show you the
[1:00:48] aftermath of what addictions can do to
[1:00:52] you we want to run to a place where we
[1:00:55] feel
[1:00:57] safe or we been hurt in an area so we
[1:01:00] build up walls and then when that area
[1:01:03] is struck again we run to a space in our
[1:01:07] life to where we feel safe to where
[1:01:10] we're never going to be hurt like that
[1:01:16] again people run to
[1:01:19] drugs that helps you forget about your
[1:01:21] problems for the moment people run to
[1:01:24] alcohol it helps you you drowned out
[1:01:26] your sorrows and your
[1:01:28] pain people run to pornography because
[1:01:31] it it it helps for the moment makes you
[1:01:34] feel good for the moment they run to
[1:01:37] habits they want to feel safe no matter
[1:01:40] the outcome they run to a shell when
[1:01:43] they feel
[1:01:45] pain this is called a split
[1:01:50] condition I found out having a
[1:01:52] relationship with the lord requires us
[1:01:56] to fully trust in
[1:02:00] God and if you don't fully trust God you
[1:02:03] will go back to the conditions that you
[1:02:05] can trust hello somebody if you don't
[1:02:09] have your full trust in God you're going
[1:02:12] to run back to the conditions that you
[1:02:15] do
[1:02:16] trust that where you feel safe Peter
[1:02:19] dealt with this he dealt with a
[1:02:22] rejection
[1:02:23] complex how many people likes to be
[1:02:25] rejected
[1:02:28] I mean yeah I do I wake up every morning
[1:02:30] and say I want to be
[1:02:32] rejected it's my goal in life to see how
[1:02:34] many people can reject me in one
[1:02:38] day no everybody loves to be
[1:02:42] accepted everybody doesn't like to be
[1:02:45] rejected so Peter was facing a rejection
[1:02:49] complex and we can see how Peter he was
[1:02:52] zealous for the Lord he loved the Lord
[1:02:55] he makes the statement that wherever you
[1:02:57] go Lord I will go I will die for you
[1:03:01] Lord but still understand in this moment
[1:03:03] of weakness he still faced a rejection
[1:03:06] complex he didn't want to feel rejected
[1:03:09] he wanted to feel accepted he wanted to
[1:03:12] be accepted so we begin to see the story
[1:03:15] of Peter how he's standing beside the
[1:03:17] fire when Jesus walks
[1:03:22] in and Peter denies Christ what
[1:03:26] happened Peter goes to his safe place in
[1:03:29] his condition remember remember they
[1:03:31] they approached him the people around
[1:03:33] the fire said hey ain't you the guy that
[1:03:35] followed
[1:03:37] Jesus well well no no no he didn't want
[1:03:41] to be rejected he wanted to be accepted
[1:03:44] so he what
[1:03:51] happened he went to a safe place in his
[1:03:54] condition
[1:03:55] and in this condition there was another
[1:03:57] identity called Peter the fisherman who
[1:04:01] didn't know
[1:04:03] Christ hello
[1:04:05] somebody he went to an area because look
[1:04:08] they found Peter naked on the boat
[1:04:10] fishing he went to an area where he felt
[1:04:13] safe to where he knew that he can trust
[1:04:16] in this condition but what happened on
[1:04:19] the day of
[1:04:22] Pentecost when the fire the tongues came
[1:04:24] down upon him what took
[1:04:27] place the coward Peter became a man that
[1:04:31] was zealous for the Lord full of Courage
[1:04:34] the next thing you see is Peter standing
[1:04:36] out saying this is that what took place
[1:04:40] it took him from the condition in the
[1:04:42] identity of Peter the fisherman that
[1:04:45] didn't know Christ to Peter the
[1:04:47] fisherman or not the fisherman but Peter
[1:04:49] the one that knew Christ
[1:04:56] he came out with a
[1:05:00] boldness but just because you have the
[1:05:04] Holy Ghost doesn't free
[1:05:06] you of
[1:05:11] hurts am I the only one that's ever
[1:05:14] experienced
[1:05:17] that you could be saved and still have
[1:05:20] the wounds and the hurts and the pains
[1:05:21] from the
[1:05:22] past where you need God to come in and
[1:05:25] completely perform surgery upon your
[1:05:31] heart brother Robert probably knows this
[1:05:33] but there is a process since he's good
[1:05:36] with
[1:05:37] computers there is a process that a
[1:05:41] computer goes through when it crashes is
[1:05:43] called the rebooting
[1:05:45] process pardon
[1:05:49] me and what it does it refreshes all the
[1:05:53] system memory registers making them
[1:05:55] ready to start over again it makes it
[1:05:59] look good makes it look
[1:06:01] clean but if you have a piece inside the
[1:06:05] motherboard that's
[1:06:07] toxic no matter how many times you reset
[1:06:10] your computer until you change the piece
[1:06:13] inside of that motherboard it's always
[1:06:16] going to go back to that toxic setting
[1:06:18] you can reboot it and you can reboot it
[1:06:21] and you can reboot it and it looks good
[1:06:22] it looks great but after time what takes
[1:06:25] place it goes right back to that toxic
[1:06:31] condition so what they have to do is
[1:06:33] unplug the equipment and they have to go
[1:06:36] to the motherboard and you will find
[1:06:38] things that look like discs they are
[1:06:40] called Cash memories I assume sister
[1:06:43] Leah knows that too she's good at
[1:06:44] computers as well and once you replace
[1:06:47] the faulty piece the computer will start
[1:06:51] working like it's supposed
[1:06:54] to they see the mind is like a
[1:06:58] computer the average human brain has the
[1:07:01] ability to store the equivalent of
[1:07:04] 2.5 million gigabytes of digital
[1:07:08] memory that it's a lot that's a lot of
[1:07:11] memory how many gigabytes you know 2.5
[1:07:14] million gigabytes how much is that on a
[1:07:16] regular computer is there any computer
[1:07:18] that can hold that there's none there's
[1:07:21] none so you can see we can store a lot
[1:07:25] of good and we can store a lot of bad
[1:07:29] here and it's amazing brother Dyan how
[1:07:31] you could be 99% good memories but it's
[1:07:34] that 1% of bad that can completely
[1:07:38] destroy all the good
[1:07:40] memories
[1:07:42] hello and it's in this moment of pain
[1:07:45] Satan came in and changed out a fault a
[1:07:48] good piece with a faulty piece so you
[1:07:51] come to church and in the presence of
[1:07:53] the Lord you get the reboot that you so
[1:07:55] desperately need you feel good you feel
[1:07:57] great You Feel clean you like yes yes I
[1:08:00] needed this I feel awesome but then
[1:08:03] something will trigger an emotion or a
[1:08:06] feeling or a pain then you go back to
[1:08:09] that faulty setting again hello somebody
[1:08:12] then you'll come back you'll get
[1:08:13] rebooted only to fall back to that
[1:08:16] faulty setting again we all need a good
[1:08:19] rebooting and a good refreshing daily
[1:08:21] don't we Paul said I Die daily but some
[1:08:24] of us need the great physician to come
[1:08:27] into our heart and take out that faulty
[1:08:29] piece and replace it with something new
[1:08:34] again we can come to church and feel the
[1:08:37] presence of the Lord but until we deal
[1:08:39] with that faulty toxic peace within the
[1:08:42] motherboard which is our
[1:08:44] heart no matter how many
[1:08:48] times we get a rebooting in the presence
[1:08:50] of the Lord until you change out that
[1:08:53] faulty piece you're always going to go
[1:08:55] go back to that
[1:08:58] setting a complex a pain a hurt you know
[1:09:04] like I said maybe I should look at the
[1:09:05] wall and preach to myself because this
[1:09:07] is something I've been dealing with
[1:09:10] something that the Lord has been showing
[1:09:11] me in my heart you can come to church
[1:09:14] you can have a position you can have a
[1:09:17] role you can sing you can do whatever
[1:09:19] you want to do but until that faulty
[1:09:22] peace is replaced within your heart no
[1:09:25] matter how many times you try in your
[1:09:27] own ability until God performs surgery
[1:09:31] and places a new piece within that heart
[1:09:34] you're going to keep falling to
[1:09:35] addiction after addiction to pornography
[1:09:39] to drugs to alcohol trying to drown out
[1:09:42] the pain but there is a God that's a
[1:09:45] Healer that can perform surgery on that
[1:09:49] toxic peace
[1:10:06] do you love
[1:10:11] him know with in my own heart I needed
[1:10:19] that had to come to a place of complete
[1:10:22] honesty to where God I needed God I I
[1:10:25] need
[1:10:29] you God I need
[1:10:36] you we allow the cares of this world
[1:10:41] to to put heaviness upon
[1:10:44] us we allow cares of this
[1:10:49] world and if we're not careful we'll be
[1:10:52] so weighed down with the cares of life
[1:10:56] to where we don't see any way out and
[1:11:00] it's in these moments of weakness where
[1:11:02] the devil will come in and will place
[1:11:04] things within your life he'll bring up
[1:11:07] memories things that you thought you
[1:11:08] forgotten he'll bring it up in these
[1:11:11] moments of
[1:11:13] weakness in your moments of
[1:11:17] pain your moments of
[1:11:21] hurting he'll Place resentment he'll
[1:11:23] Place bitterness let me tell say
[1:11:25] something bitterness is a
[1:11:29] poison resentment is a
[1:11:34] poison not only does it affect you but
[1:11:38] it poisons those that you talk
[1:11:41] to it can poison your
[1:11:44] spouse it can poison your brother your
[1:11:47] sister your F your family church members
[1:11:50] bitterness resentment can utterly
[1:11:53] destroy you see brother brother Kobi how
[1:11:55] do you know this because I have been
[1:11:59] there I face
[1:12:01] bitterness I've seen things that happen
[1:12:04] in this church as a child you know dad
[1:12:06] never dad never told us anything he
[1:12:08] always kept it to himself but as a kid
[1:12:10] you see things that take place things
[1:12:12] that transpire and as a young man I had
[1:12:16] bitterness against people that I didn't
[1:12:17] even know why I had bitterness
[1:12:20] against I just seen things that happen
[1:12:23] because people like I said hurt people
[1:12:25] hurt people and who is the number one
[1:12:27] person that is attacked first in a
[1:12:30] church the
[1:12:32] pastor and as a pastor's
[1:12:34] son you get to see a lot of fun things
[1:12:38] you get to see the good side of it you
[1:12:40] get to see the bad side of it the older
[1:12:43] I got I got to see more of the bad
[1:12:47] side and I had a lot of
[1:12:50] bitterness that I placed within my own
[1:12:53] life
[1:12:55] bitterness will
[1:12:58] what destroy you hurt people
[1:13:02] what hurt people hurt
[1:13:10] people and I had to come to a place to
[1:13:13] where I had to quit giving power over to
[1:13:16] that Spirit of
[1:13:18] bitterness you have the power within
[1:13:20] your heart to release
[1:13:23] bitterness but the the more you feed it
[1:13:26] the more it grows and it grows it's like
[1:13:28] a weed in a
[1:13:30] garden I found out I found out from
[1:13:32] brother Dave Morris about six years ago
[1:13:35] that you don't cut off a weed at the
[1:13:37] ground brother Merl what do you do you
[1:13:39] pull it up well I was talking about a
[1:13:41] garden about weeds and I told him yeah
[1:13:42] what you do is you go in there you cut
[1:13:44] it down well he got up there corrected
[1:13:45] me and said no no no no you don't cut it
[1:13:48] you don't cut it down at the ground you
[1:13:49] pull it up by the roots and a lot of
[1:13:52] times we deal with situations within our
[1:13:53] life and we cut it off at the ground
[1:13:57] thinking it's okay because once you cut
[1:13:58] it off at the ground you don't see it
[1:14:00] anymore but what takes place when you
[1:14:02] cut it off it begins to grow it begins
[1:14:04] to grow it begins to grow so you got to
[1:14:07] take that situation that root of
[1:14:09] bitterness anxiety resentment whatever
[1:14:13] you're dealing with and you got to pluck
[1:14:15] it up by the roots and say Lord I've had
[1:14:18] enough of this perform surgery Upon This
[1:14:21] Heart
[1:14:25] Romans 12:2 says and be not conformed to
[1:14:28] this world but be transformed by the
[1:14:31] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:14:34] what is that good and
[1:14:38] acceptable and perfect will of
[1:14:44] God that phrase but be transformed by
[1:14:47] the renewing of your mind we can we can
[1:14:50] we can say it this way but be
[1:14:52] transformed by replacing the old data on
[1:14:56] your mind's hard
[1:14:59] drive taking everything out of here how
[1:15:01] do you take something bad out out of
[1:15:03] your life you replace it with something
[1:15:07] good is that all right you want to get
[1:15:11] rid of junk food you got to replace with
[1:15:13] something
[1:15:14] good you want to get rid of bad memories
[1:15:17] you got to replace with something good
[1:15:19] brother Colby how do you allow that in
[1:15:21] your life by taking out the junk that
[1:15:23] you watch the junk that you listen to
[1:15:26] the junk that you read and you put the
[1:15:28] word of God in its place and you allow
[1:15:31] God to begin to perform surgery Upon
[1:15:34] Your Heart by using his word you realize
[1:15:39] that we can let Spirits continue on in
[1:15:40] our life by allowing movies that we
[1:15:43] watch and things that we read and things
[1:15:45] that we listen to can allow that Spirit
[1:15:48] to stay in powered within our

[1:15:55] the enemy in your life put something

[1:16:05] filthy music and watch God begin to
[1:16:08] transform your life right

[1:16:32] are it doesn't matter where you've
[1:16:35] been it doesn't matter the scar it

[1:16:54] self Ste you can you can have it healed

[1:17:11] today want to say I was born in in a
[1:17:14] good
[1:17:15] family I had a good mom and Dad we
[1:17:21] did but as a child I faced
[1:17:25] a rejection
[1:17:26] complex I my personality I want to be
[1:17:30] accepted as a the first born I wanted to
[1:17:34] be
[1:17:35] accepted I didn't like the feeling of
[1:17:37] letting my father
[1:17:40] down and I face that as a
[1:17:47] kid I heard at a young
[1:17:51] age I ran to addictions to help my life
[1:17:55] ran to Aras as a nine-year-old boy to
[1:17:58] make myself feel
[1:18:01] safe because I didn't feel loved even
[1:18:04] though I was loved I was loved but as a
[1:18:08] young man I didn't feel
[1:18:10] loved me what I was facing in my
[1:18:15] life and when I got married because I
[1:18:19] didn't feel loved I didn't know how to
[1:18:23] love and I've cost a a lot of pain and
[1:18:26] hurt in her
[1:18:34] life and every time I would try to open
[1:18:37] myself up to
[1:18:39] love I would make a mistake and then run
[1:18:42] deeper and deeper to the areas that I
[1:18:44] felt
[1:18:47] safe cost a lot of pain I didn't know
[1:18:49] how to love my wife I didn't know how to
[1:18:51] love my children I was afraid of hurting
[1:18:53] them I was afraid of getting too close
[1:18:55] and things happening because of the safe
[1:18:57] areas and my addictions that I
[1:19:00] had I was afraid of opening up just to
[1:19:03] hurt them not realizing me staying
[1:19:05] closed did hurt
[1:19:12] them I didn't understand why I couldn't
[1:19:14] break
[1:19:16] through the addiction I couldn't
[1:19:18] understand why I couldn't break through
[1:19:19] the the fence mechanisms the walls that
[1:19:22] I had built up to not cause the pain
[1:19:26] anymore and then I realized a few years
[1:19:29] back something
[1:19:31] hit and I realized that it was something
[1:19:33] as a child that took place in my life
[1:19:37] that I have
[1:19:38] never never let go
[1:19:42] of I struggled in my
[1:19:47] Ministry I struggled with a
[1:19:50] complex that I wasn't good enough that I
[1:19:53] could never be good enough that my
[1:19:56] father didn't love me even though he did
[1:19:58] I got the best of parents here but as a
[1:20:02] child scarred as a child reflected my
[1:20:06] every area as an
[1:20:09] adult and I had to address the situation
[1:20:12] I remember dad probably knows we dealt
[1:20:14] with this about three years
[1:20:17] ago and realizing that he didn't know he
[1:20:20] didn't know you know what's crazy is the
[1:20:22] person that has hurt you or you think
[1:20:23] they've hurt you does doesn't have a
[1:20:25] clue that it
[1:20:27] happened
[1:20:30] hello there's areas they think they
[1:20:32] think it's over and they think it's done
[1:20:34] they didn't
[1:20:35] realize that they've hurt you and you
[1:20:38] hold on to things not realizing that
[1:20:40] it's a trick of the enemy to prevent you
[1:20:43] from living to your full
[1:20:48] potential as my wife and daughter come
[1:20:51] now the musicians can come as well but
[1:20:53] they're going to be singing aong song
[1:20:54] for us tonight I'm going to read this
[1:20:57] story and it's a little lengthy but bear
[1:20:59] with me I I pray this has been
[1:21:02] okay but I'll read this
[1:21:05] story it says Rico balanced the ceramic
[1:21:09] Bowl in her tiny hands as she carried it
[1:21:11] to the
[1:21:13] kitchen it was her mother's
[1:21:17] favorite a white bowl with tiny blo
[1:21:20] blossoms painstakingly painted up the
[1:21:22] sides
[1:21:25] her mother only brought it out on the
[1:21:27] most special
[1:21:30] occasions along with the gold platter
[1:21:32] her father had
[1:21:35] created Rico loved to run her fingers
[1:21:38] over the slightly worn
[1:21:40] edges as she listened to the stories
[1:21:42] about their family in Japan dreaming of
[1:21:46] all the hands through which this bowl
[1:21:48] had
[1:21:51] passed her favorite story was there
[1:21:55] when God restored her family after they
[1:21:57] after they had been separated during the
[1:22:00] war their Joy at being reunited after
[1:22:03] being so broken hearted was tangible
[1:22:05] even to
[1:22:07] her today was her mother's birthday
[1:22:09] which Rico thought qualified as a
[1:22:11] special
[1:22:13] occasion the 5-year-old girl had climbed
[1:22:16] the cabinets and brought out the dish
[1:22:18] all on her
[1:22:21] own she couldn't wait to fill it with
[1:22:23] her mother's favorite treats and present
[1:22:25] it to
[1:22:26] her Rico's foot caught on the edge of
[1:22:29] the kitchen rug and she
[1:22:31] stumbled the floral Bowl slipped from
[1:22:34] her fingers and crashed against the tile
[1:22:37] floor the bowl laid in shards at her
[1:22:40] feet Rico sank to her knees gingerly
[1:22:43] picking up a brokenhearted shaped piece
[1:22:47] she be to
[1:22:49] cry a warm hand rested on her shoulder
[1:22:52] blurry through the tears Rico saw her
[1:22:55] grandfather's wrinkle face and kind eyes
[1:22:58] staring down at
[1:23:01] her I try to be careful she sobbed I
[1:23:05] just wanted to do something special for
[1:23:07] Mama's birthday now it's broken and I
[1:23:10] can't fix
[1:23:11] it no her grandfather's voice soothed
[1:23:14] her but I know someone who can here help
[1:23:18] me pick up the pieces Rico and her
[1:23:21] grandfather set each piece on a tray and
[1:23:24] carry them out to the
[1:23:26] garage where her father worked on a
[1:23:30] project her Pace her face ped with fear
[1:23:33] worrying that her father would be upset
[1:23:36] that she had broken her mother's
[1:23:38] favorite
[1:23:39] Bowl instead he smiled at her and
[1:23:42] wrapped his daughter in a hug and he
[1:23:45] picked up the broken pieces and examined
[1:23:48] them he says what have we
[1:23:50] here I broke Mama's bow rle explained
[1:23:53] with a Qui over in her lip well then her
[1:23:56] father spoke rolling up his sleeves we
[1:23:58] fix it but it won't be the same as it
[1:24:01] was
[1:24:02] before it'll be even
[1:24:05] better Rico watched and wander as her
[1:24:07] father a talented
[1:24:09] artist mixed a gold lacquer with a few
[1:24:12] scoops of rice flour to make an
[1:24:14] adhesive he placed the broken shards of
[1:24:17] the bow together with the glue she
[1:24:20] watched in amazement as The Bull took
[1:24:22] shape
[1:24:24] gold gleaming from the
[1:24:26] cracks her father had been right somehow
[1:24:30] it was more beautiful than it had ever
[1:24:32] been in the first
[1:24:34] place this technique is called Kint Sugi
[1:24:38] in Japan her father explained as he
[1:24:41] worked it is believed that when broken
[1:24:44] items are repaired with gold or silver
[1:24:46] like this that the flaw becomes a unique
[1:24:49] piece of the object's
[1:24:51] history and the uniqueness adds to his
[1:24:55] Beauty but papa there's a missing piece
[1:24:59] her fingers traced an empty hole where a
[1:25:01] heart-shaped Shard was
[1:25:02] missing can kits Su Guai fix that that's
[1:25:07] all right I'll make a new one he crafted
[1:25:10] a gold heart from the dust and filled

[1:25:13] space until they
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:17] glowed I've never seen something so
[1:25:20] beautiful Rico exclaimed as her fingers
[1:25:23] clasped over over her own heart but but
[1:25:26] will Mama still be
[1:25:29] mad her grandfather who had been
[1:25:31] watching from a nearby sto shook his
[1:25:34] head there will be things in our life
[1:25:37] that will break no matter how careful we
[1:25:42] are just like this ball but it doesn't
[1:25:45] mean they can't be

[1:38:12] beautiful out of my
[1:38:19] life aren't you glad that God could do
[1:38:22] surgery
[1:38:24] on our
[1:38:27] hearts he can take those
[1:38:32] things amen and he can bring that
[1:38:35] Grace you know
[1:38:37] we're every one of us as Mortals were
[1:38:42] born
[1:38:45] with imperfections it's just all there
[1:38:48] is to
[1:38:49] it and we're so easy to be scarred
[1:38:56] and we're so easy it's easy
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:02] to not be able to see things from
[1:39:05] another person's perspective
[1:39:08] even and understand from a from that
[1:39:12] other person's perspective and sometimes
[1:39:15] we
[1:39:15] can we can
[1:39:18] cast our own
[1:39:20] opinions and
[1:39:23] our own thoughts the way we see
[1:39:26] things and
[1:39:28] not totally understand where someone
[1:39:31] else is coming
[1:39:34] from and I think that
[1:39:40] in in all of our
[1:39:44] Lives the same Grace that God's given us
[1:39:50] and because if we really want to truly
[1:39:52] be honest
[1:39:57] the we don't quite all of
[1:40:00] us but we can say that we not a person
[1:40:05] in this building that quite lines up
[1:40:08] with God's expectation for
[1:40:12] us
[1:40:15] and and I think that there that's that's
[1:40:18] why love I I seen the deal that was
[1:40:22] playing before church here old on the
[1:40:25] projector in and dealing with love in
[1:40:27] one of those quotes
[1:40:30] and
[1:40:32] and the love that God gave and reaching
[1:40:36] out to me then Lord let me have that
[1:40:40] same love and reach out to my other
[1:40:43] brother to my sister to to those around
[1:40:47] me
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:53] because when you look at
[1:40:57] the you can have gifts and talents you
[1:41:00] can
[1:41:01] have you can um and as brother Kobe was
[1:41:05] sharing his testimony here
[1:41:08] tonight talented
[1:41:11] musician wonderful
[1:41:14] singer I
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:18] mean the things that Kobe's had going
[1:41:21] for him in his life is just just
[1:41:23] incredible he's just he's
[1:41:27] gifted but how Satan can build a
[1:41:31] complex and and try to and and and you
[1:41:36] might look and think wow everything is
[1:41:39] is is just beautiful I wish I could have
[1:41:44] that I wish I had that personality wish
[1:41:47] I had this I wish I
[1:41:50] wish and yet Satan can come in and and
[1:41:55] through complexes
[1:41:57] and and so it's
[1:41:59] not it's not how many gifts we have it's
[1:42:04] not where we fit in in in in the
[1:42:09] status what we
[1:42:11] need is to understand that God
[1:42:14] understands us right where we
[1:42:16] are and that God has made us exactly the
[1:42:20] way he wants us
[1:42:23] God's made you exactly the way he wants
[1:42:28] you God built brother Kobe exactly the
[1:42:32] way he wants
[1:42:34] him God built brother Michael exactly
[1:42:38] the way he wants see God made brother
[1:42:41] Merl brother Joe God's made us Caleb
[1:42:44] he's made us
[1:42:47] all but yet if we're not careful Satan
[1:42:49] will come in and we'll develop things
[1:42:52] and complexes and we'll do this and
[1:42:54] we'll do those as our brother was saying
[1:42:58] tonight but I think there's a divine
[1:43:01] grace upon us
[1:43:03] all down inside the
[1:43:06] dirt down inside the dessert the dirt is
[1:43:09] the maker of our
[1:43:11] soul the one who loves
[1:43:14] us the one who will never throw away
[1:43:17] that that God
[1:43:19] Treasures God Treasures that person that
[1:43:22] you are are here tonight he Treasures
[1:43:25] you he Treasures every one of you
[1:43:28] kids

[1:45:25] interact he's just I don't have that I

[1:45:29] thought oh
[1:45:35] God God's made us all
[1:45:38] different God's given us all
[1:45:41] gifts God loves every one of
[1:45:47] us so when we judge ourselves we judge
[1:45:50] ourselves according to him

[1:45:56] one that's making something beautiful
[1:45:57] out of our Lives aren't you glad for

[1:46:33] do I I I just so much appreciate brother
[1:46:38] kobby you know I appreciate I I I he and
[1:46:45] Mary have become such
[1:46:48] pillars in our in our church and in the
[1:46:52] music and and the gifts that they have
[1:46:58] brought we wouldn't be who we are today
[1:47:02] if it wasn't for brother Kobe and Sister

[1:47:12] I I you never have to worry about
[1:47:15] brother Kobe and sister married they've
[1:47:18] always been dependable they're always
[1:47:20] right there wanting to see the work of

[1:48:24] that your child understands that you
[1:48:27] love them and make sure don't take that
[1:48:30] for
[1:48:31] granted don't take those things for
[1:48:35] granted because I think that it is a it
[1:48:38] is a very it's it's of utmost important
[1:48:41] to knock out those Devils right now when
[1:48:44] the devil is trying to build a wedge or
[1:48:47] trying to do something in someone's life
[1:48:49] can you say
[1:48:50] amen and children should be open with
[1:48:53] their parents and their amen and and and
[1:48:57] the grace of God always flowing and
[1:48:59] that's that's something that we're so
[1:49:02] thankful for and I say today it's it's
[1:49:05] good for you you children that have had
[1:49:08] your parents raised up in the message to
[1:49:11] to be able to to be able to
