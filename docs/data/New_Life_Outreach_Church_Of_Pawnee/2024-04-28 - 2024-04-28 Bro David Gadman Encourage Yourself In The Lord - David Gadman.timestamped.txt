[41:41] distressed for the people spake a
[41:43] stoning him because the soul of all the
[41:46] people was grieved and every man for his
[41:49] sons and for his daughters for David
[41:52] encouraged him but David encouraged
[41:54] himself in the Lord his God and David
[41:57] said to abathar the priest the himac son
[42:01] I pray thee bring me hither the ephod
[42:04] and abathar brought thither the ephod to
[42:06] David and David inquired of the Lord
[42:08] saying shall I pursue after this troop
[42:11] so I overtake them and he answer pursue
[42:14] for Thou shalt surely overtake them and
[42:17] without fail recover all may the Lord
[42:20] add His blessings to the reading of the
[42:22] word you may be seated I like to read
[42:25] this little story that I got here a
[42:27] going and then after that I'll tell you
[42:28] the title of my text this this evening
[42:31] amen and got brought my I didn't so it's
[42:35] 5:38 trying to get you out here try
[42:37] maybe 45 minutes if I can so my wife's
[42:39] sitting back there tonight you can watch
[42:41] her notebook and you know or whatever so
[42:44] amen but I'd like to read this little
[42:46] story and you know and and my my
[42:48] grandson told me the other day said uh
[42:50] said Papa we went and preach for brother
[42:52] Bry said you going to read a story and I
[42:54] said well said I said Papa that's what
[42:56] you do so I got this little story and
[42:58] like I said it to go along with my
[43:00] thought and it's called mous trap story
[43:02] I don't know if anybody's ever heard it
[43:03] or not but you just get the point said a
[43:07] mouse looked through the crack in the
[43:08] wall to see the farmer and his wife open
[43:10] a package what food might this contain
[43:13] the mouse wondered he was devastated to
[43:16] discover it was a mouse trap retreating
[43:19] to the farmyard the mouse proclaimed the
[43:21] warning there's a mouse trap in the
[43:23] house there's a mouse trap in the house
[43:25] the chicken cluck and scratched raised
[43:27] her head and said Mr Mouse I can tell
[43:30] this is of grave concern to you but it
[43:32] is of no consequences to me I cannot be
[43:35] bothered by it the mouse turned to the
[43:37] pig and told him there's a mouse trap in
[43:38] the head house there's a mouse trap in
[43:40] the house the pig sympathized but said
[43:43] I'm so very sorry Mr Mouse but there is
[43:45] nothing I can do about it but pray be
[43:48] assured you you are in my prayers the
[43:50] mouse turned to the cow and said there's
[43:52] a mouse trap in the house there's a
[43:54] mouse trap in the house the cow said wow
[43:57] Mr Mouse I'm sorry for you but it's no
[44:01] skin off my
[44:02] nose so the mouse returned to the house
[44:05] head down and dejected to face the
[44:07] farmer's mouse trap alone that very
[44:09] night a sound Was Heard throughout the
[44:11] house like the sound of a mous trap
[44:13] catching its prey the farmer's wife
[44:16] rushed to see what was caught in the
[44:18] darkness she did not see it was a
[44:20] venomous snake whose tail the Trap had
[44:22] caught the snake bat the farmer's wife
[44:25] the farmer rushed her to the hospital
[44:27] and she returned home with a fever
[44:29] everyone know you treat a fever with
[44:31] fresh chicken soup so the farmer took
[44:33] his Hatchet to the farmyard for the
[44:35] soup's Main
[44:36] Ingredients but his wife sickness
[44:39] continued so friends and neighbors came
[44:41] to sit with her around the clock to feed
[44:43] them the farmer butchered the pig the
[44:46] farmer's wife did not get well she died
[44:49] so many people came for her funeral
[44:51] funeral the farmer had the cow
[44:53] slaughtered to provide enough meat for
[44:55] all of them the Mouse looked upon it
[44:57] from his crack in the wall with great
[45:00] sadness so the next thing you so the
[45:03] next time you hear someone is facing a
[45:05] problem and think it doesn't concern you
[45:08] remember when one of us is threatened we
[45:10] all are at risk we're all involved in
[45:13] this journey called life we must keep an
[45:15] eye out for one another and make an
[45:17] extra effort to encourage one
[45:20] another I thought that was pretty good
[45:23] amen so my thought for tonight is
[45:25] encourage yourself in the Lord
[45:27] encourage yourself in the Lord so I just
[45:30] dropped by this weekend to tell you that
[45:33] we need to encourage oursel in him
[45:35] tonight amen so I take this little
[45:37] thought and I thought you know I was
[45:38] thinking about David and really I think
[45:40] about every man that that uh the the
[45:43] people that God uh used in the Bible and
[45:46] that he called their names like Abraham
[45:48] and and and Moses and Noah and one thing
[45:51] about every one of these people in the
[45:53] Bible men and women alike children alike
[45:56] you know they're all were were human
[45:58] beings just like me and you are and they
[46:01] all went through problems just like me
[46:03] and you do and they all need
[46:05] encouragement just like me and you do
[46:07] because every now and then we just need
[46:08] a kind word to be said to us uh we just
[46:11] need uh H H A Kind word to be spoken to
[46:14] us am I right about it so we we need
[46:17] something to encourage us amen and so
[46:20] why not just take the word of God when
[46:22] we there's nobody around to say a kind
[46:24] word to us when there's nobody around to
[46:26] encourage just why don't we just take
[46:28] the word of God down and encourage
[46:30] oursel in the Lord tonight is that right
[46:33] amen so I just thank about that tonight
[46:36] and like I said David I like David not
[46:38] maybe because his name's David but I
[46:40] appreciate him because even the prophet
[46:43] of God said and the Bible says that
[46:45] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[46:47] and that's what I want to be tonight is
[46:49] a man after God's Own Heart I I want to
[46:52] be somebody that God can depend on that
[46:54] God can use amen I want to be one that's
[46:57] a man after his own heart and brother
[46:59] Bram said it like this that he had a
[47:00] spirit of quick repentance uh every time
[47:03] he made a mistake he repented of it
[47:05] that's what I want to be Lord cuz the
[47:07] Lord knows that I make plenty of
[47:09] mistakes I fail them every day I fail
[47:11] them every second of the day but hey I
[47:13] want to say God help me I Repent Lord if
[47:16] I made a mistake forgive me Lord let me
[47:18] pick myself up and dust myself off again
[47:21] and keep pressing on
[47:23] yes keep pressing on
[47:27] so and this looking at David you know
[47:30] many times he got in trouble even being
[47:33] a man after God's Own Heart and I think
[47:35] about one time where David he numbered
[47:38] the people and he'd done it before he
[47:41] done this before but this time I think
[47:44] he did it maybe with a wrong attitude or
[47:46] whatever you know cuz God always he
[47:48] always had to remind the people I just
[47:50] reading it in Psalms how that he always
[47:53] reminded the people how that he brought
[47:55] them out of Egypt andin he sometimes
[47:57] he's always reminding me and you man
[48:00] when things get to going kind of bad or
[48:02] or we get kind of down or or whatever he
[48:05] always reminds us hey I'm the one that
[48:07] brought you out of the world I'm the one
[48:09] that brought you out of the
[48:10] denominationalism I'm the one that set
[48:12] your feet on the Rock to stay I'm the
[48:13] one that provided you Revelation I'm the
[48:16] one that brought you into the message
[48:17] I'm him and I brought you
[48:19] out he's always having to remind us oh
[48:23] God I want to remember what he's done
[48:25] for me oh oh I tell you what I words
[48:28] can't express how I feel about what God
[48:31] has done for me oh I can't hardly I
[48:34] can't hardly sometimes I can't hardly
[48:35] take it I can't hardly stand it amen it
[48:37] just like it's just like fire shut up in
[48:39] my bones amen I think about what God has
[48:41] done for me and how he's been so good to
[48:43] me how he's provided me with a family
[48:46] with a good wife and everything else and
[48:48] sometimes sometimes I treat him like you
[48:50] know and oh you know you know how it is
[48:53] sometimes but I want to say God forgive
[48:55] me help me Lord
[48:57] I'll try to be more better I'll try to
[48:59] do better than what I've had before so
[49:01] David numbered the
[49:04] people and so there was a sear in the
[49:06] land by the name of
[49:08] GAD he came to David and said David
[49:10] youve done wrong you number the people
[49:14] and see God has said three things and
[49:17] you got a choice to make he's giv you an
[49:21] option you know what you want done cuz
[49:24] you go you going to have to you know the
[49:26] the Bible says and it's a law that
[49:28] whatever we sow we got to
[49:30] reap I hate that but sometimes it is you
[49:34] know you plant corn and you think you're
[49:36] going to get no you planted corn that's
[49:37] what you're going to get and sometimes
[49:39] we plant discouragement we we plant that
[49:43] and that's what we'll reap I I want to
[49:45] plant what God I want to plant good seed
[49:47] amen I want to plant encouragement I
[49:49] want to plant Joy I want to plant
[49:51] everything so anyway he told the Gad The
[49:54] Seer he said now David God has given you
[49:56] option he's giving you you you have a
[49:58] choice to make there's seven years of
[50:01] famine flee before your enemies for
[50:03] three months or three days of pestilence
[50:06] in the land what a
[50:08] choice what a choice and David told the
[50:13] sear he said man I'm in a great straight
[50:16] I don't know what to do he begin to
[50:18] repent he said you know what I just
[50:20] think I'll fall into the hands of
[50:22] almighty God I'll just let God help me
[50:26] amen because I know that if God helped
[50:28] me God's merciful amen when man ain't
[50:31] merciful God's merciful when man are put
[50:34] you in hell when you don't deserve to be
[50:36] there amen God is still
[50:39] merciful I like I like that God is
[50:41] merciful amen oh Hallelujah so he told
[50:46] God he said I mean so he said I'll just
[50:47] fall in the hands of almighty God cuz he
[50:50] he's merciful and then looking at that
[50:52] there were 70,000 men that lost their
[50:54] lives 70,000 can can you imagine sly
[50:57] because of the actions of David oh God
[51:00] we got to be careful what we say what we
[51:03] do and how we act cuz our actions can
[51:06] hinder a service our actions can hinder
[51:09] somebody getting healed our actions
[51:11] could hinder somebody getting saved our
[51:13] actions can H hinder somebody from not
[51:15] getting the Holy Ghost and I don't want
[51:17] my actions to hinder
[51:19] anybody because of David's action 70,000
[51:22] men lost their lives and begin to repent
[51:26] and the Lord laid it on his heart told
[51:29] him what he needed to do said Hey listen
[51:30] this is what you need to do David you
[51:32] need to rear up an
[51:35] altar and he told him where to rear it
[51:37] up at said you need to build an altar in
[51:40] the threshing
[51:42] floor of Onan the
[51:45] jebusite and so David looking and God
[51:48] had laid it on his heart what to do even
[51:50] though he repented said he needed to
[51:52] rear up that altar so he went there and
[51:55] on land the J sight and looking at that
[51:58] he gave David everything he needed to
[52:01] offer the sacrifice he gave him the
[52:03] tools he gave them the the instruments
[52:06] to offer the sacrifice even gave him the
[52:08] animal to offer the sacrifice with even
[52:11] gave them everything the the wood to
[52:13] build the altar the the the fire to you
[52:16] know to build the everything that he
[52:18] could to build the fire everything and
[52:21] David said you know God forbid that I
[52:23] would not I want to pay full price for
[52:25] it amen cuz God forbid that I would
[52:28] offer God a sacrifice that would not
[52:31] cost me nothing God tonight I'm going to
[52:34] sacrifice sometimes amen sometimes it's
[52:36] a sacrifice to come into the house of
[52:39] God when everybody's gone amen and the
[52:42] way and it's a sacrifice to come in and
[52:44] worship God but I want to Lord I don't
[52:47] want to offer you a sacrifice that ain't
[52:50] going to cost me nothing Lord let me
[52:51] come in and when I don't feel like
[52:53] clapping let me clap when I don't feel
[52:56] like raing my hands let me raise my
[52:58] hands in worship to
[53:00] you
[53:02] hallelujah
[53:03] hallelujah it's going to cost me
[53:06] something
[53:08] amen God
[53:09] forbid that I would offer to God a
[53:12] sacrifice that wouldn't cost me nothing
[53:15] what's it going to cost you amen Hey
[53:19] Brother Wendell preached only the cost
[53:22] of Our Praise amen you don't know what I
[53:26] been through amen you don't know what
[53:29] I've been going through hallelujah oh
[53:32] but I thank God tonight he still got
[53:35] Grace he still got power to see us
[53:38] through amen and so
[53:41] David amen you know his faith had failed
[53:45] him how many sometimes your faith has
[53:47] failed you hey man you think this is
[53:50] going to happen and this is going to
[53:52] happen but it goes in all a different
[53:55] direction than what you thought it was
[53:56] going to be amen maybe you thought he
[53:59] was going to go like this and like this
[54:01] and like this but he went like that like
[54:02] that and like that and you get kind of
[54:07] discouraged you pray and it seems like
[54:10] your prayers amen you pray for your kids
[54:13] amen come on now amen you pray for your
[54:16] kids seem like they get
[54:18] worse amen you pray for this and this
[54:21] and pray for the service and my I think
[54:23] the service is going to go that way but
[54:25] it goes opposite way than what you
[54:26] prayed and sometimes your faith gets a
[54:28] lot you get kind of
[54:30] discouraged Faith kind of fails you how
[54:33] many's ever been that way oh hallelujah
[54:37] amen so D David's faith it kind of
[54:40] failed him he became disheartened he
[54:43] became
[54:44] discouraged amen how many he's been
[54:46] there man I don't know who I'm speaking
[54:48] to maybe some of you there tonight you
[54:50] become kind of kind of disheartened kind
[54:52] of discouraged because you think well
[54:54] this ought to happen this ought to
[54:55] happen
[54:57] you know I gu God just trying to keep
[54:58] you humble amen you go somewhere come
[55:02] back after a meeting or somewhere
[55:03] preaching car breaks
[55:05] down he say oh God what am I going to
[55:08] but you keep on praising him anyway you
[55:10] keep on pressing anyway amen you keep on
[55:13] fighting anyway amen you know you get up
[55:16] to go to church on a Sunday morning amen
[55:18] you wake up amen it seem like you got
[55:21] 2,000 lb demons each eyelid but you got
[55:23] to get up anyway and come on and say God
[55:26] I'm going anyway I don't feel like it
[55:28] but I'm going anyway I'm going down to
[55:30] the house of God and I'm going to praise
[55:31] you anyway I'm going to offer sacrifice
[55:34] to you anyway I'm going to lift my hands
[55:36] anyway Lord hallelujah and so we become
[55:40] kind of dis Hur and kind of discouraged
[55:42] and that's where David was and brother
[55:44] Bram said it like this God never did
[55:45] call us to a picnic he called us to a
[55:48] battlefield amen so we didn't come down
[55:50] here this morning or tonight to throw
[55:53] out our our uh black our red and check
[55:55] it uh uh picnic uh spread or blanket
[56:01] amen we didn't come down here to eat
[56:03] cookies and drink milk but we come to
[56:07] battle amen we come to that's why a lot
[56:10] of people don't like to come to the
[56:11] house of God
[56:13] anymore because it's a battle Yeah to
[56:16] come to the house of God Amen it's a
[56:19] struggle sometimes to come to the house
[56:21] of God I say God help me amen but said
[56:26] it like this I might have said it here
[56:28] before but I say it again we're going
[56:31] each and every one of us I don't know
[56:32] what you're going through but how many's
[56:33] going through a
[56:35] battle amen let's be honest take the
[56:38] Halos down tonight let's be honest how
[56:40] many's going through a battle amen and
[56:42] you know what you either battle every
[56:44] day amen you battle every day let me say
[56:46] it like this you're either in a battle
[56:49] coming out of a battle or fixing to go
[56:51] into a battle you go my Lord there ain't
[56:54] no way out of it no there ain't like I
[56:56] said either in a battle coming out of a
[56:58] battle or going into a battle it's no
[57:01] picnic ground amen but when Jesus be the
[57:06] cross alone no there's a cross for
[57:09] everyone and there's a cross for me it's
[57:12] like this what sometimes gets us is the
[57:16] in between you said Brother David what
[57:18] are you talking about well God promised
[57:21] us a Rapture didn't he yes amen didn't
[57:24] he promise us a rapture well sometimes
[57:27] it's the in between that gets us the in
[57:30] between of the promise and the
[57:31] Fulfillment of the promise God promis us
[57:35] healing every one of us but sometimes
[57:38] it's the in between that gets us between
[57:40] the pro the time we got prayed for the
[57:42] promise claiming our promise claiming
[57:45] our healing and the manifestation of the
[57:47] healing amen the in between
[57:50] sometimes H like I ain't saying this to
[57:53] be funny but like this little girl one
[57:55] time came up she said I got a headache
[57:57] they said well we'll just pray for you
[57:59] prayed for her came back said I still I
[58:02] still got this headache so we prayed for
[58:04] you we're just waiting for the
[58:07] manifestation came back about an hour
[58:09] later said I still got this headache
[58:11] said well just well we just we prayed
[58:13] for you just take God's word and believe
[58:15] we're just waiting for the
[58:17] manifestation came back later and said
[58:19] Ma I wish that man from the station
[58:21] would hurry up and get here amen I'm
[58:24] still suffering with my head amen but
[58:26] get here keep holding on keep pressing
[58:29] on the promise to be here amen just wait
[58:32] he made the promise he made Abraham a
[58:34] promise but Abraham had to wait 25 you
[58:37] imagine Abraham got kind of discouraged
[58:39] when they came to hey uh father Nations
[58:42] how many children you got the
[58:45] now said he had to say not but he kept
[58:47] holding on now listen what the prophet
[58:49] said I just looked this up in the back I
[58:53] thought my this is real good I ain't
[58:55] going to read all of it cuz it's pretty
[58:57] lengthy but it's out of the church age
[58:59] book y'all been going through the church
[59:00] ages but it's uh in the Philadelphian
[59:03] Church age this is what the prophet of
[59:05] God said he said what does it mean by
[59:07] the word of my patience Hebrews 6:1
[59:11] 13-15 for when God made a promise to
[59:15] Abraham because he could swear by no
[59:17] greater he swore by himself saying
[59:19] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[59:22] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[59:25] after he had patiently endured he
[59:28] obtained the promise you see the spirit
[59:30] is speaking about the word of God which
[59:32] is given to us it's given to all of us
[59:35] is that right the promise is given to
[59:37] all of us to wait for the Fulfillment of
[59:40] that word required
[59:42] patience oh God did help me he's still
[59:45] working on me amen I need more patience
[59:49] God help me he said and the wait said
[59:52] hey he's still working on patience amen
[59:55] he said it required to wait for the
[59:56] Fulfillment of that word required
[59:59] patience Abraham had to require require
[1:00:02] patience and the Bible says he
[1:00:04] endured what about
[1:00:07] us we're promised a change of body a
[1:00:10] Rapture are we going to endure or are we
[1:00:13] going to just throw in the towel that's
[1:00:15] why I want to take the word of God down
[1:00:17] and encourage myself with it and say God
[1:00:19] I'm going to keep holding on you
[1:00:21] promised it Lord you never failed I'm
[1:00:23] going to keep holding on to your word
[1:00:26] I'm gonna keep holding on to your
[1:00:27] promise Lord amen I'm gonna keep
[1:00:29] pressing on he said even as it did in
[1:00:32] the case of Abraham he endured as seeing
[1:00:35] him who is invisible he was patient and
[1:00:38] then the word finally was
[1:00:41] fulfilled this is the way God teaches
[1:00:45] his people this is why God teaches his
[1:00:47] people patience why if he fulfilled his
[1:00:50] word and physical manifestations the
[1:00:53] very instant you prayed you would never
[1:00:56] learn patience it goes on you can read
[1:00:58] that Philadelphia and church age I
[1:01:01] thought my Lord all of us need to learn
[1:01:04] a little patience then help me Lord amen
[1:01:07] you ever pray for patience you better
[1:01:09] watch out cuz the Bible says tribulation
[1:01:11] working patience amen oh God Amen oh

[1:01:20] must fight if we're to rain amen I like
[1:01:23] how brother Wendell sings that song Amen

[1:01:27] away he didn't teach us to swim to let
[1:01:29] us drown amen there's some promises in
[1:01:32] this word that's me and yours tonight
[1:01:34] amen and I want to take the word of God

[1:06:15] how rough the King's Highway may be and
[1:06:17] it gets rough every now and then don't
[1:06:21] it but the bypasses and the detours are
[1:06:24] a lot rougher
[1:06:26] satting there that train this afternoon
[1:06:27] I thought my what they doing I didn't
[1:06:30] know what had happened to somebody told
[1:06:32] me I thought man they're taking a break
[1:06:35] they're taking a lunch break don't they
[1:06:37] know that we other people got to
[1:06:39] eat I mean they're taking a lunch break
[1:06:42] and then after lunch break they're going
[1:06:43] to smoke a cigarette and all this kind I
[1:06:45] said Lord help us and then we went
[1:06:47] through a little
[1:06:49] detour I said that was rough seen this
[1:06:52] seen sister Keys up ahead of me go
[1:06:54] through that mud hole and I go oh my and
[1:06:57] I Saidi just wash my truck before I left
[1:06:58] the house hey man I've been here two
[1:07:00] weeks and it's dirty again but I'll have
[1:07:02] to wash it before I leave maybe amen I
[1:07:04] thought my Lord amen I remember brother
[1:07:07] Billy Paul he tells this on testimony he
[1:07:09] said I remember one time when my the
[1:07:11] prophet of God said you can't stay here
[1:07:13] and do the things that you're doing so
[1:07:14] he wouldn't live with his grandmother he
[1:07:16] said this house is dedicated to the Lord
[1:07:18] now brother B Paul tells it like this he
[1:07:20] said I went out there and was living my
[1:07:22] grandma cuz I was doing things I wasn't
[1:07:24] supposed to be doing amen man and one
[1:07:26] time he was even doing something and
[1:07:28] they they noticed and they said hey
[1:07:29] ain't you William brandom's son he said
[1:07:32] No Sir William brandom would have a son
[1:07:33] like
[1:07:34] me sometimes they ask you say hey are
[1:07:36] you a Christian ain't you supposed to be
[1:07:38] a son or a daughter of God no sir no
[1:07:40] ma'am God wouldn't have a son or a
[1:07:42] daughter like me amen doing the things
[1:07:44] that I'm doing God help me and so
[1:07:47] something happened and offer I forget
[1:07:49] what kind of was that ruptured and he
[1:07:52] had to go and his grandma they had to
[1:07:53] sign for the do he said I don't know I
[1:07:54] don't know his D ain't here but you know
[1:07:56] what God is always merciful amen he
[1:07:59] works on both ends at the same time or
[1:08:01] brother BR was up in Colorado in the
[1:08:02] mountains God came down and spoke to him
[1:08:04] said get to Billy Billy need you amen
[1:08:07] him laying up there in the hospital one
[1:08:08] brother R walked in that room Billy's
[1:08:10] face lit up said Daddy go to praying he
[1:08:12] said Billy I didn't do the sinning you
[1:08:14] did the sinning you do the praying he
[1:08:16] said the way of a transgressor is awful
[1:08:19] hard so sometimes we may think the
[1:08:22] King's Highway is awful rough but the
[1:08:25] bypass and The Detour are a whole lot
[1:08:26] rougher I want to stay on the King's
[1:08:29] Highway I'm walking up the King's
[1:08:31] Highway amen so David he begin to say in
[1:08:35] his heart you know probably one of these
[1:08:37] days I'll probably die at the hands of
[1:08:40] Saul maybe you made a statement like
[1:08:42] that before you know one of these days
[1:08:44] I'll probably I'll probably falter I'll
[1:08:47] probably fail ain't no use to keep on
[1:08:50] but just hold on Amen just keep pressing
[1:08:54] so David said that so my I'll probably
[1:08:57] die so he went into the land of the
[1:08:59] Philistines him and 600 of his men and
[1:09:02] the Bible says he hook up he hooked up
[1:09:04] with King aish if I'm saying that right
[1:09:06] and he said he said I he said so he told
[1:09:09] King aish he said in the in the land of
[1:09:11] gath there and he said and and he said
[1:09:13] you know what king of kiss the king of
[1:09:15] gath he said you know what king if I
[1:09:17] found favor in your sight just give me a
[1:09:19] little town in the country why should I
[1:09:22] and my men dwell with you in the Royal
[1:09:24] City just give me a little town in the
[1:09:26] countryside so they gave him ziklag and
[1:09:29] so there he dwelt six him and 600 of his
[1:09:31] men down there in a little city called
[1:09:34] ziklag for about 16 months they dwelt
[1:09:37] there and oh my David every day King
[1:09:40] kiss said David what you do for me today
[1:09:42] and David would say well I went out this
[1:09:44] way to the north and I made a road to
[1:09:46] the north and I slew all the enemies and
[1:09:48] I brought back the spoils and then the
[1:09:50] next day would say well I went to the
[1:09:52] South and I brought back all the spoils
[1:09:54] and here's the spoils that I brought
[1:09:55] back and here's all these things and I
[1:09:57] made oh and oh kiss my he he just he
[1:10:00] just loved David he just bragged on
[1:10:02] David so much and he just begin to say
[1:10:05] about David said my David you you just
[1:10:07] you're just good and you believe David
[1:10:09] saying he has made Israel to utterly a
[1:10:11] boore that means disgust and hate him
[1:10:14] said my David You' just been so good to
[1:10:16] me and the King really believed in David
[1:10:20] my he believed him so much that he made
[1:10:22] him his right-hand man
[1:10:26] and so
[1:10:27] David was became his a kiss's right-hand
[1:10:31] man said David I know what you can do
[1:10:34] I'm just going to make you my right-hand
[1:10:36] man so it came a day when the
[1:10:38] Philistines were gathered themselves and
[1:10:40] they was going to go fight against
[1:10:43] Israel and they wanted King aiss and his
[1:10:45] men to join up with them now can you
[1:10:48] imagine here they are and David with
[1:10:49] them can you imagine cuz the king said
[1:10:52] David I want you to come and fight with
[1:10:53] us now here's David going out to fight
[1:10:56] against his own
[1:10:57] people my but you know what the Lord he
[1:11:02] always knows just what to do he's never
[1:11:05] too late and he's never too early but
[1:11:07] he's right on time I'm glad for that hey
[1:11:11] man never too late never too early but
[1:11:12] he's right on time Heen he said David I
[1:11:15] know what you can do You' been with me
[1:11:16] for these 16 months you come in you did
[1:11:19] this and you did this you destroyed this
[1:11:21] enemy you destroyed that enemy you made
[1:11:23] Israel to other hate me and I know man I
[1:11:25] know all that you can do and what you
[1:11:27] can do and so here they went out and and
[1:11:30] and and a Kish and his men get with the
[1:11:32] Philistine and here come David and his
[1:11:34] men in the rear and amen and all my they
[1:11:36] was going up there and all of a sudden
[1:11:38] the Philistines said hey what's these
[1:11:40] Hebrews doing here why they're here you
[1:11:42] know what said are they they going to
[1:11:44] fight said hey and and and the kids king
[1:11:46] of kids be begin to say Hey listen have
[1:11:48] you not heard don't you know about David
[1:11:50] don't you know about what he's done and
[1:11:53] how they sung the song David Saul has
[1:11:55] slew his thousands but David his 10
[1:11:57] thousands and this is David and said
[1:11:59] he's been with me for about these 16
[1:12:01] months I know what he can do and how
[1:12:03] he's been here and there and the Hebrews
[1:12:05] said nah I we don't want him to go we
[1:12:07] heard about David we heard about the
[1:12:08] songs they sung about David and wonder
[1:12:10] during the war they're in the battle
[1:12:12] when it's hot and heavy and he gets
[1:12:14] reconciled uh with his master and he'll
[1:12:16] do that by taking our heads off our
[1:12:20] shoulders so we don't want him to go if
[1:12:23] he's going to go we ain't going
[1:12:26] and so the King goes back over there to
[1:12:28] David and said David I'm
[1:12:31] sorry I know what you can do David I
[1:12:34] don't find no I ain't found no fault in
[1:12:36] you David you've been with me you've
[1:12:38] been good I made you my right hand I
[1:12:40] made you my armor Bearer made you my
[1:12:42] right-hand man I know what you can do
[1:12:44] David you've been with me these 16
[1:12:46] months but they saying hey they've heard
[1:12:49] about you David and they don't want to
[1:12:50] fight they don't want you going with us
[1:12:53] so early in the morning why don't you go
[1:12:54] back down his
[1:12:57] ZB so David and his men rose up
[1:13:01] early went back down there to Zig lag
[1:13:05] but you know what I believe it was God's
[1:13:06] divine
[1:13:08] intervention amen because when he went
[1:13:10] back ma David could pin these
[1:13:13] words Psalms 124:7 our soul is escaped
[1:13:17] as a bird out of the snare of the Fowler
[1:13:19] the snare is broken and we are
[1:13:21] escaped you know
[1:13:23] sometimes we we get in trouble and it's
[1:13:26] because of her own
[1:13:28] Folly how many believes that tonight
[1:13:32] because of your own Folly because of
[1:13:33] something you've done you get yourself
[1:13:35] in trouble you should have
[1:13:37] listened when you went into action or
[1:13:39] you should have went into action when
[1:13:41] you should have been listen listening
[1:13:43] and sometimes because cuse their own
[1:13:44] Folly but don't you believe God has
[1:13:46] divine intervention oh that sometimes he
[1:13:50] can amen he can work it all out when it
[1:13:52] seems like it looks like it's all going
[1:13:54] to fail and it's all going to be a a
[1:13:56] disaster got to work it out amen and so
[1:13:59] I believe God worked it out because of
[1:14:01] his folly he still wanted to trust in
[1:14:03] God oh I believe that this morning
[1:14:05] brother Mike amen or this afternoon amen
[1:14:07] even though my Folly my Folly I may have
[1:14:10] been in trouble because my own Folly but
[1:14:11] I still want to trust in the armor of
[1:14:13] almighty God tonight amen oh my as he's
[1:14:17] coming back amen and amen and he begins
[1:14:20] you know he begins to rehearse that I'm
[1:14:22] going back you know I'm going down here
[1:14:25] but you know what the Bible says he
[1:14:26] begin to remember his youthful days and
[1:14:28] he begin to take down his diary how many
[1:14:31] knows what a diary
[1:14:33] is and there's not too many young
[1:14:35] sisters in here you know but maybe Brian
[1:14:38] and some of them you know diary you
[1:14:39] write down there your special stuff that
[1:14:41] you don't want anybody to know well I
[1:14:44] know he's the one for
[1:14:46] me because when we both
[1:14:49] reached for the broccoli on the salad
[1:14:52] bar at the same time our hands touched
[1:14:55] one another oh he's the one and we write
[1:14:58] it down in our diary but you know what I
[1:15:01] got written down in mine tonight I got
[1:15:03] rent down the things that the Lord has
[1:15:05] done for me amen and I want to take my
[1:15:08] diary down and David begin to remember
[1:15:10] say hey I remember amen when I was I I'm
[1:15:14] a shepherd and I took care of my
[1:15:15] father's sheep and it's a disgrace for a
[1:15:17] Shepherd to lose any sheep and I
[1:15:19] remember when a bear came in there and I
[1:15:21] got up cuz it's a disce and I didn't
[1:15:23] want to lose a sheep that was watching
[1:15:25] out for my father and I went after that
[1:15:26] sheep and I I slew that bear and brought
[1:15:28] the Sheep back safely into the fold then
[1:15:31] lion rose up amen and stole a sheep and
[1:15:33] I went after that sheep killed the lion
[1:15:35] and brought him back safely into the Foe
[1:15:37] and maybe he said if God done it for me
[1:15:39] one time he can do it again and he
[1:15:41] encouraged himself in the Lord I want to
[1:15:43] say tonight if God healed me one time
[1:15:45] amen he can heal me again if he
[1:15:47] delivered me one time he can deliver me
[1:15:49] again and he encouraged himself in the
[1:15:51] Lord
[1:15:56] hallelujah
[1:15:58] amen so looking over the runs of that
[1:16:02] City he probably begin to say you know
[1:16:04] what I see the RS cuz the Bible said we
[1:16:08] read there that his men thought about
[1:16:11] stoning
[1:16:12] him cuse their wives have been taken
[1:16:16] captive and their sons and daughters
[1:16:17] have been taken captive but David had to
[1:16:20] take the word of God and encourage
[1:16:22] himself and he looked over that City he
[1:16:25] probably thought he probably was aching
[1:16:27] not only for himself cuz his wives both
[1:16:29] of his wives were taken captive and his
[1:16:31] and his uh sons and his daughters but he
[1:16:34] was aching for his men cuz he was a
[1:16:36] great leader and he was aching for him
[1:16:38] and he begin to look you know what all
[1:16:40] my men are thinking about stoning me
[1:16:41] look at what I done how and this trouble
[1:16:43] has come because of where I'm at and all
[1:16:46] this how many ever felt that way look at
[1:16:48] all these things that are happening if I
[1:16:50] hadn't went there well amen if I hadn't
[1:16:52] said this I hadn't have done that maybe
[1:16:53] I'd be all right tonight but because of
[1:16:55] this but David begin to look he said you
[1:16:57] know what I see the ruins I see my wives
[1:17:00] taking captive I see these other men's
[1:17:02] wife I see there but you know what yet
[1:17:03] the Lord still loves
[1:17:06] me he still loves you tonight amen yet
[1:17:10] he still loves you although I wandered
[1:17:12] away from him my heart can't rest
[1:17:14] without him though I've had little
[1:17:16] fellowship with him lately I ain't
[1:17:17] listening to tapes like I should I ain't
[1:17:19] prayed like I should I ain't fasted like
[1:17:22] I should I ain't dedicated my life like
[1:17:24] I should but yet he hasn't shut up his
[1:17:26] vows of compassion upon me and he's
[1:17:29] always been gracious to
[1:17:31] me
[1:17:33] amen and so he begin to encourage
[1:17:36] himself in the Lord amen I think about
[1:17:42] when Nathan the prophet in that day came
[1:17:45] to him and David begin to pour out his
[1:17:48] heart and David said you know what he
[1:17:50] said I he said why should I dwell in
[1:17:52] this house like a I like this house that
[1:17:54] I dwell in and God the ark dwells in
[1:17:57] tents amen he said I just want to do I
[1:18:00] want to build a house for him and Nathan
[1:18:02] told him said you go do with all that's
[1:18:04] within on your heart David you just do
[1:18:06] it well God has a program amen he's
[1:18:08] never and so he told the prophet he said
[1:18:11] you go and tell David he can't do it
[1:18:13] because he shed too much innocent blood
[1:18:15] he's done this and he's done this and
[1:18:16] tell him about his his his son I do it
[1:18:19] but you tell David that I took him I
[1:18:22] remember when he was a nobody when I
[1:18:24] when he was just hurting his father's
[1:18:25] sheep and I took him for a sheep from
[1:18:27] the Sheep coat and made a great name out
[1:18:29] of him amen I I made I took him when he
[1:18:32] was nothing and made something out of
[1:18:34] him amen I took him when he was a nobody
[1:18:36] and made somebody out of him and I cut
[1:18:38] off his enemies and David could
[1:18:40] encourage himself in the Lord what about
[1:18:43] us
[1:18:44] tonight amen he took us when we was
[1:18:46] nothing and brought us to a message that
[1:18:48] has rapt and gra fa Grace in it amen
[1:18:52] thank you Lord amen
[1:18:55] and mighty great name cut off your
[1:18:57] enemies amen how many ever gets to

[1:20:31] because he said what's Saul gonna say he
[1:20:32] said if you come in contact with Saul
[1:20:34] just say you're going down there to
[1:20:35] sacrifice at Jesse's house and just
[1:20:37] invite him to come along with you amen

[1:24:14] spirit but down on the inside of the
[1:24:16] inside that anchors let the winds blow

[1:24:31] shall Roar out a Zion and utter his
[1:24:33] voice from Jerusalem and the heavens and
[1:24:35] the Earth shall Shake but the Lord will
[1:24:37] be the hope of his people and the
[1:24:38] strength of the children of Israel amen
[1:24:41] he'll be our hope and our strength I
[1:24:44] like
[1:24:45] that Romans
[1:24:48] 4:20 he's talking about
[1:24:50] Abraham you know like I said read that
[1:24:52] about he said he endured patiently
[1:24:55] waiting for the promise waited
[1:24:58] patiently just like mean you got to do
[1:25:01] and he waited patient for the
[1:25:05] promise hallelujah oh God and I can see
[1:25:09] Abraham he's like I said earlier at the
[1:25:12] beginning of this they were men just
[1:25:13] like me and you
[1:25:15] are I imagine he got kind of
[1:25:21] discouraged amen he got kind of
[1:25:23] discouraged he got kind of disheartened
[1:25:27] people look at him can you imagine there
[1:25:29] he was Sarah being uh 95 him 100 but
[1:25:34] when they first had it he was she was 65
[1:25:37] she was 75 you know brother brand said
[1:25:39] like this he was dead amen he was
[1:25:41] sterile she was dead amen all dried up
[1:25:44] and everything but hey you're going to
[1:25:45] have a kid you're going to have a son
[1:25:48] call his name Isaac can you imagine
[1:25:51] people begin look at what's wrong with
[1:25:53] you Abraham didn't you he might have got
[1:25:54] discouraged he might have felt like
[1:25:56] giving up but you know what he kept
[1:25:58] holding on Amen kept patiently enduring
[1:26:01] amen God made the promise that is there
[1:26:03] in between am I going to stay faithful
[1:26:05] or I'm going to give up he said I'll
[1:26:07] stay faithful and he be probably maybe
[1:26:08] had to take the word and encourage
[1:26:10] himself said God you made the promise
[1:26:11] amen it's like this I was reading it the
[1:26:13] other day when brother BR talking about
[1:26:15] 1956 faithful Abraham say God put a deep
[1:26:18] sleep oh Abraham then that smoke and it
[1:26:20] got dark he said that's like everybody
[1:26:22] amen we're going to have to die amen
[1:26:23] then was smoking furnace amen everybody
[1:26:26] we going to die and we deserve hell but
[1:26:28] them other two pieces he didn't tear
[1:26:30] them but there was a bright light came
[1:26:32] up what was it testifying of the Cross
[1:26:34] amen hallelujah amen it's a cross if it
[1:26:37] wasn't for Calvary one of us we neither
[1:26:39] one of us would be here this this
[1:26:40] afternoon amen but I thank God for
[1:26:42] Calvary and I can encourage myself in
[1:26:44] the Lord
[1:26:46] amen
[1:26:48] hallelujah and so Paul wrote it up like
[1:26:51] this after all them years he said he
[1:26:55] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:26:57] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:27:01] giving glory to
[1:27:03] God all them failures he might have went
[1:27:05] through and discouragements the Bible
[1:27:08] says he staggered
[1:27:09] not thank
[1:27:11] God that's me and you because we're the
[1:27:14] Royal Seed of Abraham tonight Abraham in
[1:27:17] spite of all his mistakes you know and

[1:30:58] ain't trusting in my prayers this was
[1:30:59] his prayer but I'm trusting in his grace
[1:31:02] oh that's what I'm doing I'm trusting
[1:31:04] his grace I think about John the Baptist
[1:31:07] amen oh here he was he was in jail amen
[1:31:11] oh he thought my what am I doing in jail
[1:31:14] and he he he and his eyes got kind how
[1:31:16] his eyes have got kind of skimmed over
[1:31:18] every now and then you think well I
[1:31:20] wonder if this message is really right
[1:31:21] or
[1:31:22] not come on
[1:31:25] you with me
[1:31:26] tonight amen and so John said I wonder
[1:31:29] if it's him or should we look for
[1:31:30] another so he's told his disciples said
[1:31:33] you go down there and ask John or ask
[1:31:35] Jesus said is he the one or after he
[1:31:38] already IND introduced him said Behold
[1:31:40] the Lamb of God that takes away the sins
[1:31:42] of the
[1:31:43] world but his eyes got kind his Eagle
[1:31:45] Eye got kind of fmed over he said go ask
[1:31:47] him he's the one or should we look for
[1:31:50] another and so when
[1:31:52] Jesus told his
[1:31:55] disciples that John had sent down there
[1:31:57] he didn't say here's a book seven steps
[1:32:00] how to have joy in prison give this to
[1:32:02] John when you go back no he just say
[1:32:05] stay around and see what you have see
[1:32:07] what you see in this meeting what did
[1:32:10] they see the lame begin to walk the dumb
[1:32:13] begin to speak the deaf begin to hear
[1:32:16] and the gospel the poor had the gospel
[1:32:18] preached to him they saw him and as they
[1:32:21] started to go back to tell John he said
[1:32:23] hey
[1:32:24] wait a
[1:32:25] minute don't only tell them what you saw
[1:32:28] but also tell him this there's not a man
[1:32:31] that's been born of a woman greater than
[1:32:34] John Hallelujah and when they went down
[1:32:36] there what did he tell them what did his
[1:32:38] disciples tell John they told him what
[1:32:40] he seen amen what he what they had heard
[1:32:42] and did he say anything else oh yes
[1:32:44] Johnny also said this there was not been
[1:32:46] a man born of a woman greater than you
[1:32:47] are John and John could encourage
[1:32:49] himself in the Lord come take this head

[1:43:23] rest
[1:43:25] behind the
[1:43:27] H
[1:43:29] Veil so rest little
[1:43:33] bride rest for all is
[1:43:42] well you know
[1:43:44] David in
[1:43:47] the story that brother Gavin was telling
[1:43:50] us about he encourages himself in the
[1:43:52] Lord Lord and then tells the priest to
[1:43:55] bring the ephod and asks shall I pursue
[1:44:01] shall I
[1:44:03] overtake and it says and he answered
[1:44:06] him pursue for Thou shalt surely
[1:44:09] overtake them and without fail recover
[1:44:11] all he had encouraged himself and then
[1:44:14] he received the word of God and he was
[1:44:16] able to rest because the promise had
[1:44:18] been given he left knowing he was going
[1:44:22] to have victory he could walk out he was
[1:44:24] chasing the enemy but he already knew it
[1:44:26] was over he already knew it was done the
[1:44:28] victory had been promised he encouraged
[1:44:31] himself and then when the word of God
[1:44:33] came to him he was able to go into rest
[1:44:36] knowing what it was going to
[1:44:38] be we are in this age where we have
[1:44:42] those times of discouragement we have
[1:44:44] those times of problems that come along
[1:44:46] and we have to encourage
[1:44:49] ourselves but we have it even better
[1:44:51] where the word of God has already been
[1:44:53] given to us we already have the message
[1:44:55] for this age we already know the promise
[1:44:58] that's been handed to us we already have
[1:45:01] the promise that God's our healer we
[1:45:03] already have the promise that God's our
[1:45:05] provider we already have the promise
[1:45:07] that God will meet every
[1:45:10] need and so we can sit there and we can
[1:45:13] encourage ourselves in the word and
[1:45:15] immediately enter into that rest because
[1:45:18] it's already been said it's already been
[1:45:20] done the promise is already there we're
[1:45:22] simp simply waiting for the
[1:45:24] manifestation we're simply waiting for
[1:45:26] it to show but we can be in
[1:45:29] rest because the word's already spoken
[1:45:31] we already have that word to fall back
[1:45:34] on I really enjoyed the service this
[1:45:38] evening it
[1:45:41] was it was just a
