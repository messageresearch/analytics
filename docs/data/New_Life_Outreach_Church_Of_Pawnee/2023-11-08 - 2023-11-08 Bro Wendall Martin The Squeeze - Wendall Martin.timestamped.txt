[42:19] the righteousness of the Saints and he
[42:21] saith unto me right blessed are they
[42:24] which are called unto the marriage
[42:26] supper of the lamb now we're also going
[42:30] to look here in Revelations the 6th
[42:33] chapter and the 9th
[42:35] verse amen so the righteousness of the
[42:39] Saints is the fine linen and the bride
[42:42] has made herself ready now we're going
[42:46] to look at another at a at another woman

[42:54] Revelations the 6th chapter CH and the
[42:57] nth
[42:58] verse and when he had opened the fifth
[43:00] seal I saw under the altar The Souls of
[43:03] them that were slain for the word of God
[43:05] for the testimony which they held and
[43:08] they cried with a loud voice saying how
[43:11] long oh Lord holy and true does thou not
[43:14] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[43:17] dwell on the earth and white robes were
[43:21] given unto every one of them and it was
[43:24] said unto them that they should rest yet
[43:26] a little while or for a season until
[43:29] their fellow servants also and their
[43:31] Brethren should be killed as they were

[44:38] church say
[44:40] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[44:43] seated here tonight amen like to say
[44:47] that we're just um amen so uh blessed to
[44:53] see brother Josh and sister Laur beta uh
[44:57] back home as they
[45:00] have uh been out ministering and um and
[45:05] uh preaching I think my goodness I think
[45:08] they've been gone for six six weeks I I
[45:11] believe it was and um so uh the the the
[45:16] kids have have grown up so much since we
[45:19] have seen them and and uh uh so we're
[45:23] glad to have them back with us here
[45:25] tonight back
[45:27] home you know I want to minister here
[45:30] tonight on on title it the
[45:33] squeeze and
[45:35] um uh we have just read of the bride and
[45:41] we have just read an account of the
[45:44] Jews and both of
[45:48] them uh will be where one was
[45:53] given the equipment to be made
[45:57] ready and um and then one will be given
[46:01] uh robes amen later
[46:05] on as we have as we look at where we are
[46:09] and I we we've talked a little bit we uh
[46:13] we all know what has been going on there
[46:15] in in Israel and and the persecution and
[46:19] uh that uh just just the the nonsense um
[46:26] the satanic thing that has taken place
[46:28] to them back on the
[46:31] 7th of last month and we uh and then we
[46:36] can see hear all of the rhetoric around
[46:38] the world of of the um amen the
[46:43] anosmatic
[46:45] uh uh stuff that is going the hatred
[46:48] that is going against the Jew and and it
[46:52] and it brought brought some things back
[46:54] to my mind and I I want to deal tonight
[46:57] on The Squeeze I I I um maybe this is a
[47:02] will be a sort of a weird message but
[47:03] this is Wednesday night you don't expect
[47:05] too much on Wednesday nights anyways and
[47:08] uh uh but you are I I want us to look at
[47:13] this because there has been those who
[47:17] have said that the bride will go through
[47:19] a squeeze which will be a
[47:22] persecution and and I want to just go
[47:26] through some things here and maybe amen
[47:29] uh uh show you that there is a squeeze
[47:32] for the bride and there is a squeeze for
[47:35] the Jew but it is not the same squeeze
[47:38] there's a persecution that is going to
[47:41] take place a a natural persecution
[47:45] that'll take place for Israel amen and
[47:48] this is something that they have endured
[47:50] for the last 2,000 years but it took a
[47:53] prophetic Ministry U a Joshua Ministry
[47:57] if you will who who was able to take the
[48:00] word and to divide each their portion
[48:04] and and and there is a portion to the
[48:06] bride and there is a portion to the Jew
[48:09] and then there's a portion or the
[48:11] 144,000 and there's also a portion to
[48:14] the church and so while some are looking
[48:17] for a physical persecution of the Bride
[48:21] I I don't feel that that as a student of
[48:26] the message amen that that is accurate I
[48:29] I I understand that there were
[48:32] statements that were made but I want us
[48:34] to really look tonight at this
[48:37] persecution because I I believe there's
[48:40] an error in in believing that we're
[48:43] waiting for the persecution before the
[48:46] bride comes into a a powerful Ministry I
[48:49] think there is a there is a great error
[48:52] in that I believe that is this is
[48:54] something that will amen that you you
[48:57] you are you are putting something off
[48:59] for the future that is to be taking
[49:02] place right now we're not waiting for
[49:05] the ministry of the Bride the bride is
[49:08] in her ministry right now and we should
[49:12] be expecting a powerful Church even now
[49:16] as we amen as as we are living in this
[49:20] age can you say amen amen and so amen uh
[49:25] if if you will uh just follow brother
[49:28] brandom amen uh a little bit after the
[49:33] after the Feast of the trumpets amen I
[49:36] think that's when a big Corner was
[49:38] turned uh uh for brother brandham
[49:40] because up to this point brother brandom
[49:42] was looking to take the uh uh uh uh
[49:46] eight nights and he was going to preach
[49:48] the Seven Seals or the seven Trumpets
[49:52] like he was uh preaching the Seven Seals
[49:55] and then he found that he he couldn't
[49:56] get the building and everything that
[49:58] they done he says he and Billy and and a
[50:00] few others were working hard trying to
[50:02] get it all put together and and it just
[50:04] never would work and when brother
[50:05] brandham amen uh uh just just went to
[50:08] the Lord and asking the Lord the Lord
[50:11] appeared under brother brandham and says
[50:14] you've already preached this it's under
[50:17] that fifth and sixth seal amen it's
[50:20] already been preached it has nothing to
[50:23] do with the church this has to do with
[50:26] the Jews and so then in the as as
[50:29] brother Bram begin to minister amen uh
[50:33] he he he begin to really bring some of
[50:37] these these nuggets out and to make it a
[50:39] little more clearer or not a little more
[50:41] clearer but a whole lot more clearer
[50:45] amen now brother bradam had made
[50:46] statements such as amen um uh there he
[50:52] says uh he says we had him coming last
[50:54] night with a great sword to kill and we
[50:56] found out that he gets killed with a
[50:58] sword too and the sword of the word he
[51:01] says God's word sharp two-edge sword
[51:03] slays him puts him right down wait till
[51:05] them seven Thunders utter their voices
[51:07] to that group who can really take the
[51:09] word of God and hand it there it'll
[51:12] slice and cut and they'll close the
[51:14] heavens they can shut this and and do
[51:17] that what whatever they want to he'll be
[51:19] slayed by the word that proceeds uh
[51:22] proceeds through his mouth it's sharper
[51:24] than a two-edged sword they could call
[51:26] for a 100 billion tons of flies if they
[51:29] wanted to amen it's whatever they say is
[51:31] going to happen because it's the word of
[51:33] God coming from the mouth of God amen
[51:36] amen and so there there have been many
[51:40] and and and I was one of them amen in my
[51:44] early years that took that that word of
[51:46] God and or took that word from the
[51:48] prophet and misquoted that that quote
[51:51] right there saying we are looking for
[51:54] the bride's Revival it's going to come
[51:56] it's going to come at the at the time I
[51:59] was ignorant amen I didn't I thought the
[52:02] Thunders I had been taught by uh some of
[52:05] those Brothers in the Thunder Group that
[52:06] the Thunders had not been open yet and
[52:09] that we were looking for the seven
[52:10] Thunders to be to be revealed but then
[52:13] we find out amen that that that brother
[52:15] bradam specifically said when they were
[52:18] asked are we still waiting for the
[52:20] Thunders to be revealed he says no
[52:23] that's what the seven seals were all
[52:26] about they were the Hidden Mysteries
[52:29] contained in the seals amen so we find
[52:32] out amen now it's not a future event but
[52:37] it's a right now event as far as the
[52:39] Thunders are concerned but then later on
[52:42] brother brandham in 64 was asked amen he
[52:45] he was asking he says will the bride uh
[52:48] before Jesus comes will she have the
[52:50] power of the Holy Ghost to perform
[52:52] Miracles and raise dead and so on as in
[52:54] the latter rain or is this latter Reign
[52:57] for the 40 144,000 Jews will all
[53:00] ministers have this or are we just
[53:02] waiting for the coming and he said yes
[53:05] he said now I'm not a theologian I I I'm
[53:08] therefore I have to teach all that I
[53:11] know about the Bible from types and
[53:13] shadows he says you can kind of call me
[53:15] a a typologist but if I can look at the
[53:18] wall and I've and I've never seen myself
[53:21] and I look and I can see uh that I got
[53:24] ahead ears and hands I know something
[53:28] about what I'm going to look like after
[53:31] I see myself if I can see the reflection
[53:33] in a mirror I know what I would look
[53:37] like if if I could stand off and look at
[53:39] myself he says and that's the way I
[53:41] think it is of the Bible all of these
[53:43] things Romans 26 said happens for our
[53:47] examples and we can look back and see
[53:50] what it was like the moon reflecting the
[53:52] sun we know what the sun will be uh if
[53:56] if we ever see the sun then we can see
[53:58] the moon and see that it's going to be
[54:01] greater than that well he says he says
[54:03] when you see what happened in the Old
[54:05] Testament it's a reflection of what
[54:08] happens in the new he says now notice
[54:11] Abraham now as he dealt with Abraham so
[54:15] has he dealt with his seed now he's
[54:17] still talking about the power he's still
[54:20] he's still answering their question he
[54:22] says let's go back in the Old Testament
[54:25] let's see what they have to say about it
[54:27] he says now he says uh uh one of these
[54:30] days when I come back sometime I want to
[54:32] take a little uh uh
[54:34] um take that a little closer and show
[54:37] you exactly the Stations of Abraham's
[54:39] life he says it's exactly with Luther
[54:42] and Wesley and on down to here just
[54:44] exactly as he dealt with the churches
[54:46] like he did with Abraham and how he
[54:48] appeared and and how that when he
[54:50] confirmed the Covenant to him under the
[54:53] the the shed blood it was Philadelphian
[54:56] age yes sir that was that was the blood
[54:58] age and he says Luther and the wesleyian
[55:01] age and then we watched the Pentecostal
[55:03] age he says he says he he come up here
[55:06] and made the promise of el Shai nurse
[55:09] for me the question is can you nurse he
[55:11] says what was brought before the
[55:13] Pentecostal sea can you nurse but they
[55:16] didn't do it they grabbed a breast of
[55:18] the denomination where they came out of
[55:20] but then the seed the real seed came on
[55:24] to
[55:26] of that breast of God and and what was
[55:28] the last sign they had before the
[55:30] promised son they waited on all these
[55:32] years he come back what was uh it says
[55:36] it was God standing in the form of a man
[55:39] could discern the thoughts that was in
[55:41] Sarah's heart he says and Sarah being
[55:44] the church representing the church
[55:46] discern the thoughts that is in the
[55:48] church that was even left behind him I
[55:50] know this is a lot of reading right now
[55:52] but I just want to read this read this
[55:53] to you before we get started he says and
[55:56] immediately after that she was changed
[55:58] back to a young woman and him a young
[56:02] man and Isaac was brought on the scene
[56:04] the promised son he says I believe
[56:07] you're seeing the last thing that'll
[56:10] happen to the church before the Rapture
[56:14] the Reign is over you just just read the
[56:17] the first three chapters of Revelations
[56:19] and you'll see what's happened to the
[56:20] church that's that's what's promised the
[56:22] church right there the church ages you
[56:24] know noticed the other day when we
[56:25] started them trumpets and the Holy
[56:27] Spirit says that don't belong here he
[56:30] says uh the latter Reign 144 Jews
[56:33] thousand Jews says it says U Elijah and
[56:36] Moses there's where the Miracles take
[56:39] place the things that the people's been
[56:41] looking for the Pentecostals for
[56:43] miracles and that's where that'll take
[56:45] place see the Elijah and Moses they
[56:49] Smite the Earth with the curses as they
[56:52] uh as often as they will and they close
[56:54] the heavens that it don't rain in the
[56:56] days of their prophecy and they stand
[56:57] and fight for them like he did he'll
[57:00] bring them out under a mighty hand just
[57:02] as he did in Egypt he says our portion
[57:05] we're just waiting on the coming of the
[57:10] Lord so we're not looking for a future
[57:14] Revival somebody says no future
[57:17] Revival we are the
[57:20] Revival we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[57:24] we're his body we're not looking for
[57:28] hallelujah we're not looking for another
[57:30] man to bring Revival we're not looking
[57:31] for somebody to interpret the Thunders
[57:33] we're not looking for another we're not
[57:35] looking for an Elisha we are we are the
[57:37] Elisha we are the ones that the prophet
[57:42] came to to equip us and set us in order
[57:47] with authority and power of His word
[57:50] well can you say amen amen now and and
[57:54] and they they asking again and uh you
[57:57] know and and uh about the Jews being
[58:00] saved and the brides being saved and and
[58:03] brother brandham says that's a good
[58:04] question he says the first thing the
[58:06] first place the confusion is is what I
[58:09] said about the Gentile days be done when
[58:11] the tri in the tribulation he says now
[58:14] the Gentile bride not the Gentile church
[58:17] now the Gentile church will go through
[58:19] the tribulation period but see the bride
[58:23] is the elected they go through nothing
[58:27] but the Rapture they're just changed and
[58:30] taken out of the world he says now he
[58:33] says uh the Jews that's left is the ones
[58:36] who will be preached to by the two
[58:38] prophets Moses and Elijah amen another
[58:41] place on on uh the uh physical
[58:43] persecution uh they asked in 64 brother
[58:47] Brandon will the bride go through
[58:48] persecution as the early Apostolic
[58:51] Church did he says no I just explained
[58:54] it a few few minutes ago the next thing
[58:57] is the rapture now remember we are at
[59:02] the promised
[59:06] Landen he says you understand the march
[59:10] of Israel amen so uh there here was
[59:13] another and he says he says now if I'm
[59:15] standing in line to get into the church
[59:17] is if standing in line that's another
[59:19] question uh is will only be a memory
[59:22] what is it going to be uh if we are not
[59:25] going through the tribulation are we to
[59:28] be is there some suffering he says the
[59:31] the the question is probably this I'm
[59:34] trying to hurry and I ought not to do
[59:36] this I ought to be laying these things
[59:38] back uh uh because there's there's a
[59:40] there's a place you could stay on it for
[59:41] an hour and just tear it down he says
[59:43] but he says look the people are wanting
[59:46] to to say thinking that the church is
[59:49] going to hit tribulation it won't it
[59:53] can't because because it's redeemed the
[59:57] church the nominal Believers like lot
[59:59] he's going to go through tribulation
[1:00:01] period and be saved as if it were by
[1:00:03] fire Noah went through the tribulation
[1:00:06] carried above it come out with ham and
[1:00:08] polluted the Earth again lot came out
[1:00:11] with his own daughters and slept with
[1:00:12] him but Abraham brought forth the Royal
[1:00:15] seed brought forth the seed of the
[1:00:18] promise Enoch went to glory in the
[1:00:21] Rapture and just took a walk and went
[1:00:23] home he never went through the
[1:00:25] tribulation period now there you are he
[1:00:28] says it does not the Bible cannot buy a
[1:00:30] type the types can't fail it does not
[1:00:34] predict the bride now the church will
[1:00:37] now the people say well what about the
[1:00:39] early Saints what was that that was the
[1:00:41] changing of
[1:00:43] dispensations that was under a
[1:00:45] persecution which if you were here to
[1:00:48] hear the church ages and to see how they
[1:00:50] went out into the darkness and and had
[1:00:52] to do that then that that shows that
[1:00:55] they had to take that persecution
[1:00:57] because each one of the church ages
[1:00:59] everything begin to show that they went
[1:01:01] darker and darker until finally it went
[1:01:04] completely uh denied his name and picked
[1:01:06] up another name that they live but he
[1:01:08] says but then come to the time of the

[1:09:01] God because if you get numb to it and
[1:09:05] you embrace it and you allow the Creeds
[1:09:07] to be set up in your mind you'll
[1:09:10] sacrifice the very life and power of God
[1:09:13] and if the power ever leaves your soul
[1:09:16] there's nothing left but religious forms
[1:09:19] of godliness there's nothing left but
[1:09:22] Church attendance with no life there's
[1:09:24] nothing left but Bible studies with no
[1:09:27] power there's nothing left with prayer
[1:09:29] meetings with no passion amen there's
[1:09:32] nothing left but a a a mediocre
[1:09:39] lifestyle The
[1:09:42] Squeeze is not a persecution to come the

[1:11:10] is lives in Liberty can you say Amen so
[1:11:13] God's bride is not looking for a
[1:11:16] National Force to put her into the power
[1:11:20] of God brother brandom says like Israel
[1:11:22] back in the promis plan she don't know
[1:11:25] how she got back there but she was just
[1:11:28] automatically put back there why the
[1:11:30] National Force put her in her place now
[1:11:33] I'm going to say something National
[1:11:36] Force put Israel in her Homeland
[1:11:38] National Force will put the church in
[1:11:40] the world Council of churches but the
[1:11:43] power of God will put the people in The
[1:11:46] Bride the world faces this way and the
[1:11:50] world forces that way but God forces
[1:11:53] upward
[1:11:55] the spirit of God which is the word of
[1:11:57] God my word is spirit and life will put
[1:12:00] the bride in her place because she will
[1:12:05] recognize her position in the
[1:12:10] word and then she's in Christ and will
[1:12:13] put her in her place no National Force
[1:12:16] will do that no na but National Force
[1:12:18] will drive Israel to the Homeland
[1:12:20] National forces of the Council of church
[1:12:22] will drive every organization into it
[1:12:25] but the power of God will raise the
[1:12:28] bride into Glory out of it he says all
[1:12:32] people recognize your day as Jesus
[1:12:35] warned you the sign of Sodom the church
[1:12:37] sets conditionally in this day he says
[1:12:40] look what he said in this day would take
[1:12:43] place listen to it real close now the
[1:12:45] sign of Sodom would take place in the
[1:12:47] day the sign like Abraham that day
[1:12:51] before Sodom or uh uh uh before Sodom
[1:12:55] was called out all these things was
[1:12:57] prophesied will be taking place
[1:13:01] now can I hear an
[1:13:03] amen now it's the power of God that'll
[1:13:07] raise her up recognize we're not looking
[1:13:10] for something in the future recognize
[1:13:12] the authority you have
[1:13:16] now recognize brother if there's a time
[1:13:19] for the Holy Ghost to be in the church
[1:13:21] it is now not later now
[1:13:23] [Applause]
[1:13:26] if for prayer meetings are are a little
[1:13:28] amen lack a daisy then we need to ask
[1:13:32] God to bring back the power amen if the
[1:13:35] word isn't as is isn't as Rich to us as
[1:13:38] it once was it's not because you've
[1:13:40] heard the sermons amen time after time
[1:13:42] it's because you have gotten numb to
[1:13:45] what God is doing you've got to
[1:13:49] recognize what God has
[1:13:51] done it's your path power not lifting up
[1:13:55] a prophet not exalting a man it's your
[1:13:58] power to a
[1:14:00] Rapture can you say
[1:14:02] Amen now brother B says the power of God
[1:14:05] Rises her up Hallelujah the fourth seal
[1:14:09] am man when the church goes
[1:14:12] up Satan comes down someone says when
[1:14:16] the church goes
[1:14:18] up Satan comes
[1:14:20] down so the church has got to go
[1:14:25] up now we know that that's a compound
[1:14:27] meeting amen there're in Revelations the
[1:14:29] 4th chapter and it says and there was a
[1:14:31] door that was opened up to me in the
[1:14:33] heavens and there was a call that said
[1:14:36] amen uh uh uh uh come up hither and I
[1:14:39] will show you things which must come to
[1:14:42] pass Hereafter amen that scripture is a
[1:14:44] compound meaning there has to first of
[1:14:47] all be a spiritual rising up that's what
[1:14:51] the that's what the rapt rapure is it's
[1:14:54] a catching
[1:14:56] up and the Rapture is a catching up of
[1:15:00] our
[1:15:01] soul it's a rising up to the conditions
[1:15:04] that God's called you to into the
[1:15:07] Heavenly
[1:15:08] places it's those heavenly places
[1:15:11] that'll take you hallelujah it's the
[1:15:15] position of the Bride that gives you
[1:15:18] that
[1:15:19] Authority can you say amen amen now
[1:15:24] I I want you to catch that he says now
[1:15:27] amen you say uh brother Wendell if
[1:15:29] that's the case then why do we have all
[1:15:31] of these other
[1:15:33] persecutions brother Wendell if what
[1:15:34] you're saying is right then why is the
[1:15:36] Chinese some of our Chinese Brothers in
[1:15:39] prison and they're tortured why do we
[1:15:42] have a lot of people dying for their
[1:15:44] faith around the world Amen the
[1:15:46] persecution of the church has been here
[1:15:48] for the last 2,000 years amen there's a
[1:15:52] difference in the persecution of the Jew
[1:15:55] and the persecution of the
[1:15:59] Bride
[1:16:00] Hallelujah now there's always been and
[1:16:04] there always will be persecutions for
[1:16:09] the
[1:16:09] bride and this is not just in the
[1:16:11] Physical Realm this is also in the
[1:16:13] spiritual amen we've been beat and
[1:16:16] killed and imprisoned for the word's
[1:16:17] sake amen my brother Bram says a casual
[1:16:20] study into the history of the church
[1:16:22] will show us amen from the even from the
[1:16:25] days of Pentecost all the way down to
[1:16:27] where we are that Satan has always been
[1:16:32] there to fight the church can you say
[1:16:34] Amen people have given their lives
[1:16:36] people are giving their lives in prisons
[1:16:39] and the elect have been killed for the
[1:16:41] for the gospel sake in in as I say in
[1:16:44] China in the Muslim countries and amen
[1:16:47] around the world but there's no prophecy
[1:16:50] of a worldwide person persecution
[1:16:54] against the Bride of Jesus Christ before
[1:16:58] the
[1:17:00] Rapture there's no prophecy there is
[1:17:03] there are y'all hearing me there there
[1:17:05] is no wholesale
[1:17:07] persecution that is coming to the
[1:17:11] church except for the
[1:17:14] spirits of dogmas and brother Brandon
[1:17:16] went through all of this in the in in
[1:17:18] the Feast of the trumpets amen the
[1:17:21] church and the 144,000 they get the
[1:17:26] persecution the bride is dealing with
[1:17:29] those Church Devils that wants to take
[1:17:32] the life of God from
[1:17:35] you hallelujah hallelujah can you say
[1:17:40] Amen now the Feast of the trumpets were
[1:17:42] strictly for the Jews not the bride and
[1:17:45] it will be the
[1:17:47] persecution of the Jews that will that
[1:17:51] that actually brought the Jews back to
[1:17:52] their their Homeland it was the
[1:17:54] persecution of Hitler and Stalin and and
[1:17:57] these other men that brought the Jews
[1:17:59] back to their Homeland it made them
[1:18:02] desperate they didn't want to go back to
[1:18:03] that old that old
[1:18:06] Hallelujah that old nasty country of
[1:18:08] Israel that little Barren desert they
[1:18:11] they they were happy where they were but
[1:18:14] God gave them a
[1:18:17] promise can you say
[1:18:19] amen amen so Hitler Rose and amen and
[1:18:23] and and and and you know and there were
[1:18:26] millions of Jews that were killed
[1:18:29] Hallelujah and and what did it do it
[1:18:31] created a
[1:18:33] desperation to go back
[1:18:35] home amen it created a des well praise
[1:18:38] the Lord amen now we know that there's
[1:18:42] got to be a Moses and Elijah that is
[1:18:46] going to preach the same message the
[1:18:50] same gospel the same Jesus the same
[1:18:54] blood Covenant that you have to the
[1:18:58] Jews and they will receive the same holy
[1:19:02] ghost that you
[1:19:04] received well praise the Lord but it can
[1:19:08] only happen as a nation in
[1:19:13] Israel praise the Lord amen and so the
[1:19:18] persecution of the Jews is not even
[1:19:22] similar to the bride's
[1:19:24] trials amen the Jews are under
[1:19:30] judgment well praise the lord they're
[1:19:33] they're still under they're under
[1:19:34] judgment what what did they say when the
[1:19:37] Jews rejected and crucified their
[1:19:38] Messiah and they scream crucify him
[1:19:41] there in Matthew 27 and 24 and pilate
[1:19:43] saw that he couldn't Prevail nothing but
[1:19:45] rather a tumult was made and he he took
[1:19:49] water and washed his hands before the
[1:19:51] multitude saying I'm innocent of the
[1:19:52] blood of this just man uh just person
[1:19:55] see ye to it and then answered all the
[1:19:58] people all the people and said his blood
[1:20:01] be on us and our children that was the
[1:20:03] worst thing they could ever say they
[1:20:05] rejected their
[1:20:08] Messiah they
[1:20:09] rejected amen and it wasn't a few years
[1:20:12] later when Titus came in and and and and
[1:20:15] blood literally ran out the temple amen
[1:20:19] literally ran out into the road there
[1:20:22] was such a Slaughter of Jews back in
[1:20:24] Titus because they rejected God's
[1:20:27] Messiah they rejected are y'all hearing
[1:20:30] me they were under and they they were
[1:20:33] under judgment and were dispersed to
[1:20:37] every nation under the under the
[1:20:39] heavens Israel went for 2,000
[1:20:44] years not a nation the Jews went with no
[1:20:48] Nation for 2,000 years oh praise the
[1:20:51] Lord
[1:20:53] praise the Lord but God
[1:20:55] says I've given a promise unto
[1:20:59] Abraham I've given a promise that thy
[1:21:03] seed shall possess and shall inherit
[1:21:05] well praise the Lord can you say amen
[1:21:09] amen but you see we we understand
[1:21:11] through through the Apostle Paul's
[1:21:13] writings amen he there there in Romans
[1:21:17] 11 and 8 it shows that God was the one
[1:21:20] that blinded their eyes to his presence
[1:21:23] if you look there in Romans 11:8 it says
[1:21:25] according as the written God ha given
[1:21:26] them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that
[1:21:29] they should not see and ears that they
[1:21:30] should not hear un this day and David
[1:21:32] had said uh uh let their table be made a
[1:21:35] snare and a trap and a stumbling block
[1:21:37] and recompense unto them let their eyes
[1:21:39] be darkened that they might not see and
[1:21:41] bow down their back hallways can you say
[1:21:44] Amen now the Catholic Church says see
[1:21:46] the they're the enemy of God but then
[1:21:48] you go to the 11th verse and it says I
[1:21:50] say then have they stumbled that they
[1:21:53] should fall God forbid but rather
[1:21:57] through their fall salvation is coming
[1:22:00] to the Gentiles for to provoke them to
[1:22:02] jealousy now if the fall of them be the
[1:22:05] riches of the world and the diminishing
[1:22:07] of them The Riches of the Gentiles how
[1:22:10] much more their
[1:22:13] fullness so now the Apostle Paul is

[1:30:24] testimony which they held now this is
[1:30:26] not this has nothing to do this is not

[1:31:06] robes were given unto every one of them
[1:31:08] and it was told them that they should
[1:31:09] rest for a little season until their
[1:31:11] fellow servants also and their Brethren
[1:31:13] should that should be killed as they
[1:31:15] were should be fulfilled in other words

[1:31:41] other Feast but the Feast of the
[1:31:43] trumpets come right after the
[1:31:45] Pentecostal
[1:31:48] Feast the the the Feast of Pentecost or
[1:31:51] the the Feast of Weeks it went for seven
[1:31:55] sabbaths brother Bram says that we have
[1:31:57] been in the Feast of Pentecost for the
[1:32:00] last seven Church
[1:32:02] ages and when we are caught up then the
[1:32:07] the trumpets will begin to sound to the
[1:32:11] Jews and will be pulling her back now
[1:32:15] what was it if you if you were to go
[1:32:16] look at the Old Testament Feast of the
[1:32:18] trumpets amen number one it was a call
[1:32:21] to to repentance number two it was a
[1:32:24] call unto God to remember his Covenant
[1:32:26] with Israel number three it was to th
[1:32:28] Satan's accusations of Israel before God
[1:32:32] it was a call of
[1:32:34] preparation Amen brother Brandon would
[1:32:36] tell us that those trumpets was to call
[1:32:39] to prepare telling them to come because
[1:32:43] the next Feast was going to be the day
[1:32:45] of atonement so the so the the the the
[1:32:49] trumpets were to sound and prepare the
[1:32:53] Jews the
[1:32:55] persecution was to bring the Jews to a
[1:32:58] place in their
[1:33:00] heart to where they can receive the
[1:33:04] atonement well praise the
[1:33:07] Lord now we're seeing right what we're
[1:33:09] seeing right now amen now now in the Old
[1:33:13] Testament they were to sacrifice the
[1:33:15] perfect wooly lamb amen and they were to
[1:33:17] do it with
[1:33:18] sincerity amen it was a call and when
[1:33:21] they do it now now now they would have
[1:33:23] to go through this ritual and they there
[1:33:25] had to be a time of mourning it was a
[1:33:27] time of weeping it was a time of
[1:33:31] repentance before God and then the day
[1:33:34] of atonement they would walk over to
[1:33:37] take that lamb that would be killed for
[1:33:40] them are y'all understanding what I'm
[1:33:42] saying it's the it's this persecution of

[1:36:44] of Pentecost and the Feast of the
[1:36:45] trumpets was a long period of time
[1:36:47] exactly 50 days between Pentecost and

[1:37:13] fruits representing the first fruits of
[1:37:15] the Holy Spirit to be poured out upon
[1:37:16] the people and we find out then that
[1:37:18] them 50 days was received by the
[1:37:20] Gentiles which God called from the
[1:37:23] Gentiles the people for his name the
[1:37:24] Feast of the Pentecost we have been

[1:37:42] name now at the end of these seven
[1:37:45] sabbaths which has been there was to be
[1:37:48] a day of an atonement which was the

[1:37:52] trumpets was to call for a day of mour
[1:37:55] to call back for the sacrifice or the
[1:37:58] atonement and we find out then that the

[1:54:15] amen
[1:54:17] amen if the musicians would come
[1:54:22] praise the
[1:54:24] Lord amen now God when he made man in
[1:54:28] the beginning he made him a superior to
[1:54:29] any thing on the earth he gave him the
[1:54:32] jurisdiction of everything on the earth
[1:54:34] to control everything controlled animal
[1:54:36] life he controlled the foul life the
[1:54:37] fishes of the sea he controlled the
[1:54:39] winds he controlled the plant life he
[1:54:41] controlled
[1:54:42] everything man was made as a secondary
[1:54:45] God on the earth and he was given the
[1:54:47] power to control all
[1:54:51] things all the elements of the earth
[1:54:53] that was Adam Adam was given these great
[1:54:56] Powers but then the power that he had to
[1:54:59] make himself is where he fell and but
[1:55:01] Adam could speak to the winds and it
[1:55:03] would stop he could speak to the trees
[1:55:04] and they obeyed he could speak to the
[1:55:06] wildlife it would
[1:55:07] obey he could speak to the waters every
[1:55:09] what it was everything obeyed Adam
[1:55:13] that's the beginning of
[1:55:15] man that's what God gave him power over
[1:55:18] everything on the Earth
[1:55:20] now though he fall he's lost through the
[1:55:23] fall he's lost the
[1:55:26] power then he becomes unconscious of the
[1:55:29] fact after he's losing his relationship
[1:55:32] and friendship and fellowship with a
[1:55:33] father then he lost that and all of his
[1:55:37] great channels become clogged up and he
[1:55:39] couldn't get through what Adam was in
[1:55:45] God I want you to listen to me now this
[1:55:47] is not just another
[1:55:48] quote now what Adam was in God Christ
[1:55:52] has redeemed us back to that Our
[1:55:56] Redeemer a redeemer anything is to bring
[1:55:59] it
[1:56:00] back can you say
[1:56:03] man he says if we were to just going
[1:56:05] down for the sake of times one man fell
[1:56:08] he lost this but what he lost in the
[1:56:11] fall Christ came as the Redeemer did you
[1:56:13] ever stop to think what Christ redeemed
[1:56:15] us for he gave us everlasting life he
[1:56:17] brought us back to the Eternal fellow
[1:56:19] ship and relationship to God to be sons
[1:56:21] and daughters again to restore us back
[1:56:23] to all that Adam lost in the fall the
[1:56:26] thing of it is since he has restored man
[1:56:28] back man in in the fall lost his
[1:56:31] consciousness of what God put him here
[1:56:32] on the earth to do in other words all of
[1:56:35] us Plumbing as it were and his brain
[1:56:37] Outlets his faith has been clogged up
[1:56:39] with the business Affairs home life
[1:56:41] domestic things it's all become so
[1:56:43] clogged
[1:56:44] up until God can't operate through the
[1:56:47] channels that he made man for
[1:56:50] that when God made the human body every
[1:56:51] little part had its place to play the
[1:56:54] teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God
[1:56:57] does everything in there to make it
[1:56:58] perfect in operation to make man to live
[1:57:01] and if God so patterned the man the body
[1:57:04] of
[1:57:05] man how much more has he pattered and
[1:57:08] set in order the body of
[1:57:10] Christ the
[1:57:14] church I'm saying that there is not a
[1:57:16] weakling church that he's coming for
[1:57:19] it's going to be a glorious
[1:57:23] Church devils are fighting but we're not
[1:57:25] under judgment we're he's very well
[1:57:29] pleased he's pleased that he's got a
[1:57:32] woman that trust him loves him believes
[1:57:39] him on that side he was a Son of God on
[1:57:43] this side he he was a he was a fallen
[1:57:47] creature on that side he's an offspring
[1:57:50] of
[1:57:51] God he has the inheritance of the earth
[1:57:54] he can control nature he can speak it
[1:57:55] into existence he's the Creator himself
[1:57:58] he's The Offspring of God but when he
[1:58:00] crossed he separated his
[1:58:02] sunship he's a sinner by Nature now he's
[1:58:06] under the hands and Dominion of
[1:58:08] Satan God took a sacrifice the chemical
[1:58:11] of the blood but the blood of bulls and
[1:58:13] goats cannot divorce sin it only covered
[1:58:15] sin if I've got a red spot on my hand
[1:58:17] and cover it with white the red spot
[1:58:19] still there see it's still there but God
[1:58:23] sent down from heaven a bleach for sin
[1:58:27] it was the blood of his own son that
[1:58:28] when our confessed sin drops into God's
[1:58:32] bleach try to find it again the coloring
[1:58:34] of sin goes back through the mediators
[1:58:37] down through the time until it hits the
[1:58:39] accuser Satan and lays on him till the
[1:58:42] day of
[1:58:43] judgment what happens to the
[1:58:46] son he becomes in perfect fellowship
[1:58:48] with the father father again standing on
[1:58:50] that side of the chasm with no
[1:58:53] remembrance sin against him there's no
[1:58:56] more stain a a bleach can be seen
[1:58:59] anymore he's free Hallelujah just as the
[1:59:02] clor rocks or just as that ink can never
[1:59:05] be ink no more because it's broke up and
[1:59:08] sent back when confessed sin is
[1:59:11] confessed and been dipped a man or woman
[1:59:14] that's been dipped into the blood of
[1:59:16] Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms
[1:59:19] every molecule of sin goes back to the
[1:59:22] devil and laid on him till the day of
[1:59:24] judgment where his eternal destination
[1:59:26] will be thrown into the cast into the
[1:59:28] Lake of Fire and the chasm is bridged
[1:59:30] never to come into the remembrance no
[1:59:31] more a man stands
[1:59:35] Justified as a Son of
[1:59:38] God
