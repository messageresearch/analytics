[31:12] Brother Kobe sing dece me but here in
[31:17] Acts 2 I mean acts 7 excuse me in 47 he
[31:21] goes but Solomon built him a
[31:25] house how be it the most high
[31:28] dwelleth not in Temple made with
[31:32] hands as said the
[31:36] prophets Heaven is my Throne Earth is my
[31:40] foot stol what house will eild me sayeth
[31:46] the Lord or what is the place of my rest
[31:51] if we go to Ephesians 2 and9
[31:58] I started another series there and and
[32:01] we're taking the whole message of this
[32:06] statue of a perfect man and just
[32:08] breaking it down in different ways of
[32:11] how brother brandham brought it
[32:13] out and we know that that statue of a
[32:16] perfect man we know that that's
[32:19] Christ but in this Christ wants a body
[32:24] all right and so here in Ephesians 2
[32:26] and9 it says now
[32:30] therefore ye are no more strangers or
[32:34] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[32:38] Saints and of the household of
[32:42] God and are built upon the foundations
[32:46] of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus
[32:49] Christ himself being the Chief
[32:52] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[32:56] fitly framed together growing unto a
[32:59] holy Temple in the
[33:02] Lord in whom we also are built together
[33:07] for
[33:08] inhabitant of God through the spirit
[33:13] praise the Lord you may be
[33:15] seated I would like to minister just for
[33:17] a little while building a house for the
[33:21] Lord okay all right building a house for
[33:23] the
[33:25] Lord here in statue of a perfect man
[33:29] brother Bron was saying he was now God
[33:31] or the Bible says here that Stephen
[33:35] spoke of Solomon building a
[33:38] temple and the most
[33:40] high don't dwell in the temples made
[33:44] with hands for Heaven is my Throne Earth
[33:48] is my foot stol and where is the place
[33:51] of my
[33:53] rest but a body hast thou prepared me
[33:57] you can turn me down if I
[34:02] need and where is the place of my
[34:06] rest but body H has thou prepared me he
[34:11] said amen there you are a body has has
[34:16] thou prepared
[34:18] me God dwells in a statue of a man
[34:23] reflecting himself unto that being
[34:29] now when he was when I read this I was
[34:33] thinking how can I build a house for the
[34:36] Lord
[34:37] yes because the prophet of God says he's
[34:40] already done
[34:41] it yeah so what is our job to do today
[34:47] what are we got to do to prepare a house
[34:50] that God can have rest in
[34:53] okay okay this flesh was born in sin
[34:57] shape of
[34:58] iniquity yes sir it was going to
[35:02] hail if something didn't come to redeem
[35:08] it God in his mind prepared you to be
[35:13] Sons and Daughters of
[35:15] God but he not
[35:18] only designs you to be that he designed
[35:22] you to be a
[35:24] house so the Lord can come and live in
[35:27] sure yes sir
[35:31] individually but this
[35:34] individually is more than just Sons and
[35:37] Daughters of
[35:39] God it takes the body of
[35:43] Christ to be the body that God's going
[35:46] to dwell
[35:49] in you are
[35:52] material in the thinking of
[35:54] God every one of you has gifts in the
[35:58] body yes my heart is a
[36:04] gift my kidneys are a gift if my kidneys
[36:08] are sick the body's
[36:12] sick and so this house has to be
[36:15] prepared but before this house can be
[36:18] prepared it has to be on the right
[36:20] foundation and with the right
[36:22] foundation then you take the word of God
[36:25] the materials and build God a house
[36:33] in the
[36:35] gra what
[36:37] we what he's
[36:41] done you and I
[36:49] do so he goes a body has thou prepared
[36:53] me God dwells in a stature of a man
[36:57] reflecting himself in the being perfect
[37:01] worship God in us being his Tabernacle
[37:06] God
[37:08] manifesting okay so don't let the devil
[37:12] ever tell you that you don't have
[37:15] nothing in you to be
[37:18] Christians God created you to be
[37:22] Christians he created you to be Sons and
[37:25] Daughters of God it doesn't matter how
[37:28] you came to this earth he's got
[37:31] something downside of your heart it's
[37:33] called a soul and that
[37:35] soul is going to prepare a place that
[37:39] God can dwell
[37:41] in
[37:44] Hallelujah so where is God God came off
[37:48] his
[37:49] throne right he came into a body he was
[37:53] promised that he was going to be a
[37:55] redeemer he came to the Earth in a
[37:58] little
[38:00] body you were preach on Christmas too I
[38:05] guess on you were the stinking stable
[38:09] yeah Christ come to a stable that was
[38:13] stinking with cows and horses and all
[38:16] kinds of things you were born and
[38:18] shaping of iniquity a bunch of lies and
[38:21] junk of this world
[38:24] unbelief but he didn't let that stop him
[38:27] to come down into your heart and to make
[38:30] you know that who you are
[38:33] today God himself come down to manifest
[38:37] himself in
[38:40] you you should be sitting in your seat
[38:43] saying God is the one the reason why I'm
[38:46] sitting here today is because of
[38:49] him and if we can realize that the
[38:52] reason why we're breathing this evening
[38:55] is because you are in the his Redemption
[38:59] plan and
[39:07] he's broken
[39:11] word through
[39:13] you hallelujah hallelujah now who's the
[39:18] statue of a perfect
[39:21] man Christ has been here and gone yeah
[39:25] yeah come on
[39:27] yes yeah he says I got to go back to my
[39:30] father y but I will send you the
[39:35] comforter and that comforter has to go
[39:37] somewhere it's just not on the space of
[39:40] the
[39:41] time that's why the Bible says you can
[39:43] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[39:46] recover and if they have any sins they
[39:49] are
[39:49] [Music]
[39:51] forgiven exactly what Jesus did Lazarus
[39:55] come forth he had to come forth
[39:58] now where is he at statue of a perfect
[40:01] man Hallelujah he's in
[40:03] you and if you don't believe that you
[40:05] need to find an altar somewhere and find
[40:08] God because the Bible clarifies that he
[40:12] works only through the
[40:17] body I might be the
[40:20] toe but one of you might be the brain
[40:23] you might be the heart yeah but without
[40:26] that toe you're going to walk
[40:29] funny and if your heart ain't working
[40:31] right your blood ain't going to go like
[40:33] where it needs to go your lungs are
[40:35] going to start failing your everything's
[40:37] going to start failing if the heart
[40:38] ain't
[40:41] pumping but when I'm hurt first thing I
[40:44] do I go find something to make it feel
[40:48] better the only thing that's going to
[40:50] make the church feel better is God
[40:53] himself and we cry upon him he's the one
[40:56] that's all D to take care of you and I
[40:59] hallelujah hallelujah because why bless
[41:05] the word says
[41:07] so praise be to God a foundation is what
[41:11] we need to start our
[41:16] house this
[41:18] Foundation has been
[41:21] made go in you can go to Genesis and
[41:24] follow the history
[41:28] everything in Genesis all the way down
[41:30] to Malachi 4 Was preparing Christ to
[41:36] come everything in the Old Testament was
[41:42] dentifying that little Ruth needed to be
[41:46] redeemed and it had to be a close
[41:49] relative to redeem
[41:52] her Israel without
[41:55] you can't be
[41:58] completed because the Bible says God has
[42:00] a bride amen and boas had his eyes upon
[42:07] a lady and he wanted her but he knew
[42:12] that there was a closer uh
[42:17] kin so he had to go to the elders and
[42:21] when he got to the elders because he
[42:23] knew the nature of that Kinsman
[42:29] he was selfish he wanted everything for
[42:33] his glory and if it wasn't going to be
[42:35] glory he didn't want nothing a part of
[42:37] it but so he started out
[42:41] Naomi she's back oh she is isn't she she
[42:45] needs a well I'll redeem
[42:48] her he got him he hooked him because
[42:52] Boaz knew
[42:57] that he was a stiff neck
[43:00] legalistic
[43:02] Jew no
[43:05] Grace he had his his own thinking and he
[43:09] goes to redeem her you have to redeem
[43:13] Ruth you've got to give her a portion of
[43:17] your wealth yeah you've got to give him
[43:20] a give her a portion of your
[43:24] inheritance yeah
[43:27] and he says I don't want
[43:30] her you take her yeah and Boaz stood
[43:34] there in the midst of the elders and
[43:36] says this day you are witnesses and he
[43:40] kicks off the shoe and throws it to him
[43:45] and
[43:45] says I redeem
[43:48] her okay and I will fulfill the kinsman
[43:53] redeemer yeah praise the Lord
[43:58] in the Old Testament was lining up who
[44:01] Christ was right from Matthew to
[44:05] Revelation it's Christ Building a Church
[44:12] yeah and in this church there was many
[44:16] members
[44:18] bodies and he had to start right there
[44:22] before he can build the
[44:23] house we know that contractors have to
[44:27] go out and get all the material the
[44:29] prophet of God saying they had to go out
[44:31] and get these materials they had to go
[44:33] get the wood they had to go get these
[44:38] things he had to
[44:40] prepare but see he couldn't get the
[44:43] material he couldn't get anything unless
[44:46] he has the blueprints all right the
[44:49] blueprints was going to tell him exactly
[44:51] what they going to need for that house
[44:57] that beautiful house on the back page
[44:59] couldn't do nothing until that first
[45:01] page was taken care of
[45:04] first the
[45:06] itemizer of all the
[45:11] material and when he got that all
[45:14] figured out then he started
[45:18] digging
[45:21] ditches to put a foundation in before he
[45:24] could build a house
[45:28] that's what the prophet of God come
[45:30] for he was a master
[45:33] builder he was anointed to come this age
[45:38] and bring you back to the material
[45:40] that's going to give you a house so he
[45:44] can live
[45:49] in I want you to find some place that
[45:53] you can build a foundation of something
[45:58] will take
[46:00] you there besides Jesus
[46:03] Christ I want you to find something
[46:06] that'll give
[46:08] you that much
[46:10] satisfaction you find it and then come
[46:14] tell me I've done everything brother
[46:17] Brown said I was big enough to do and
[46:21] some things I wasn't big enough to do
[46:24] I've tried but I have have never found
[46:28] nothing yet that's ever touched the
[46:31] place of the lifegiving flow of the
[46:34] power of God the holy spir the holy
[46:37] ghost coming down upon me brother that
[46:41] night the anchor my soul in his
[46:45] Everlasting
[46:48] salvation there is nothing out there
[46:52] that will ever satisfy you Church except
[46:55] Christ
[46:57] we can act all kinds of funny we can
[46:59] walk in the graveyard at night and
[47:02] whistle but you're still
[47:04] scared but in Christ you don't have to
[47:07] worry no
[47:09] more because he's going to give you
[47:12] Eternal rest on Earth today you don't
[47:16] have to wait till you get there but the
[47:18] manifestation of God is going to be in a
[47:21] bride and this bride is going to produce
[47:25] Jesus
[47:27] the word for this hour that Royal Seed
[47:32] of Abraham came out through a gentile
[47:35] bride and she has everything she
[47:40] needs in her
[47:44] now
[47:46] hallelujah it's on the property you just
[47:49] got to go out there with your blueprint
[47:52] and pick up the right
[47:54] stuff you go out there and pick up and
[47:57] say okay I'm ready to go and the
[47:58] material is still over there you're not
[48:00] going to build a house yeah because the
[48:03] first thing you should have grabbed was
[48:04] a shovel and started making ditches all
[48:07] right to make a
[48:09] foundation but when you
[48:12] realize that your foundation is built on
[48:15] the word that's your
[48:18] foundation and when you realize it
[48:20] that's the word that you could build
[48:23] your house on there's not a devil in
[48:26] hell they can take it away from you
[48:28] because that has been proven to be the
[48:31] foundation that God has built for you
[48:33] and I to conquer every devil everything
[48:37] that comes your way you got it just on
[48:39] that
[48:41] Foundation
[48:43] Hallelujah bless the Lord and so
[48:47] now he's telling them let me please show
[48:51] me but then he goes on and he
[48:53] goes this eternal Sal ation it's peace
[48:59] like a river peace like
[49:02] a Eternal salvation it's peace like a
[49:07] river peace like a river oh church he
[49:11] keeps repeating
[49:13] this now I repeated one more more than I
[49:16] should have but I did because it is it
[49:18] feels that way to
[49:20] me have you just been out there one day
[49:23] and God just dealing with your hearts
[49:25] maybe your sisters are
[49:27] washing dishes and things and all of a
[49:30] sudden the presence of God just comes
[49:32] down and you just oh everything is
[49:34] fading
[49:37] away when the storms are coming you
[49:41] should have rest knowing that you're in
[49:42] the harms of God that he's going to take
[49:46] you through
[49:47] it stop looking out here the
[49:50] circumstances look back and see the
[49:52] footprint that Jesus has got you in his
[49:55] arms and he's walking you through that
[49:58] trial he's walking you through those
[50:01] things keep your eyes on the
[50:04] blueprint because storms do come we have
[50:06] to stop building and we got to go
[50:08] through these storms until the storm
[50:12] goes but a man or a daughter of God is
[50:15] not going to sit home and wait till the
[50:16] storm
[50:17] goes they're going to find something to
[50:20] do to be ready to start building again
[50:28] and so
[50:29] now peace like a river Something Happens
[50:34] live or die what difference does it make
[50:38] we're going to be in his presence turn
[50:41] back to a young man and woman living
[50:45] that way forever and forever eternity so
[50:49] what have we got to worry about there's
[50:53] no perfect there's no perfect happens
[50:58] outside of
[51:01] that that's why it's
[51:04] important to read your
[51:08] book it's important to you young people
[51:10] to get into your
[51:12] Bible and read and find out the promises
[51:16] of God but brother William I read it I
[51:19] just don't understand come to
[51:22] church be sincere to God say God this
[51:25] blueprint I just don't understand
[51:28] it can you bring
[51:32] somebody some architector to come and
[51:35] tell me how to build my house cuz I
[51:37] don't understand and he'll send you a
[51:41] preacher that understands the blueprint
[51:44] all right and he'll come in and he'll
[51:47] open it up and say this is what you're
[51:49] doing wrong this is what you need to be
[51:51] doing you're taking the wrong tools to
[51:53] do the job with screw drivers are not
[51:57] going to put a nail
[52:00] in but
[52:03] this
[52:05] mortified nail gun that's hooked to that
[52:07] air
[52:08] compressor will do the job for
[52:12] you you don't have to just swing a
[52:14] hammer
[52:16] anymore you can grab that air compressor
[52:20] by the hose and go click it into a this
[52:23] little thing that has a handle on with a
[52:25] trigger on it and
[52:30] go little Spanish guys up them
[52:35] roofs Lord have
[52:38] mercy that'd be done
[52:40] already but see God has
[52:44] labors to do the right job and he has
[52:48] called you to build him a
[52:51] house Hallelujah he's got the material
[52:54] laying right there
[52:57] GL only thing we got to do is get into
[53:00] the blueprint and find out how to build
[53:02] a
[53:03] house and if you don't understand come
[53:06] to church say Mr architector
[53:10] Pastor I'm stumped I'm having a hard
[53:13] time with
[53:15] this and
[53:17] watch the great master builder will come
[53:20] down and say hey through the
[53:23] anointing and tell you exactly
[53:26] to Build That
[53:28] Wall hallelujah hallelujah cuz
[53:32] why he's peace like a river
[53:37] amen
[53:38] first he's it's his way second it's the
[53:43] truth the third it's the light fourth
[53:46] it's the only Eternal found found
[53:49] foundation and fifth he's the only
[53:52] Eternal happiness and joy six he's the
[53:56] only lasting achievement he
[54:00] is praise be to God
[54:03] why yes he's been
[54:06] proven he's been proven yes he's been up
[54:10] in the high mountains and he was
[54:13] tempted and he used what the foundation
[54:17] word it is written it is written we have
[54:22] the right to use the same
[54:24] words against the enemy
[54:27] amen he has to come off your
[54:31] foundation what is that foundation with
[54:33] a bunch of snow on it's nothing you
[54:36] don't go home for 4 days until it comes
[54:39] off you go out there with big shovels
[54:41] and you scrape that devil right off your
[54:45] foundation it takes work it takes prayer
[54:49] it takes Agony it takes these things to
[54:52] make you get to a place
[54:56] because when the foundation is built and
[54:58] you start putting walls up you're saying
[55:00] hey I can see something here remember
[55:03] when we started
[55:05] this it was nothing but five acres with
[55:08] a bunch of nonsense on it a broken down
[55:12] house
[55:16] snakes yes a bunch of
[55:19] rats everything you can imagine was in
[55:22] it yeah but we had a vision yeah
[55:26] and you started cleaning and you started
[55:29] taking things down you started seeing
[55:32] something come away from this piece of
[55:34] property that wasn't belonging there
[55:37] because it was given to you it's your
[55:39] inheritance it's yours to build a house
[55:42] of God up on
[55:43] it and you worked on Mondays you worked
[55:47] on Tuesdays but you didn't stop you came
[55:50] to here and you started working them
[55:52] evenings and them evenings and the
[55:55] sisters
[55:56] prepared food for us and what
[56:01] happened all the worldly stuff was
[56:05] off all the dead trees were
[56:09] gone and God
[56:11] sent a backo
[56:13] operator and he started digging ditches
[56:17] glory and we're on a foundation and it's
[56:22] holy because of work
[56:27] yeah they saw Abraham's Faith by his
[56:33] Works Abraham saw the word and he had
[56:37] faith that he was going to have a
[56:40] baby yes but his faith
[56:44] proved what he believed
[56:46] in you guys believe that we're going to
[56:48] have a church now we never believe that
[56:51] we was going to have it in one year but
[56:52] we did it or you guys did it I was all
[56:55] Ed up
[56:57] but God is faithful God is here to make
[57:03] you
[57:05] perfect through the blood he sheds blood
[57:08] on you God can't see you except sees
[57:12] Jesus hallelujah it's not your little
[57:15] mistakes that you make he
[57:17] sees it's because the blood's already
[57:19] covered you from the bottom of your feet
[57:22] to the top of your head he's in love
[57:25] with you
[57:27] amen I love it when he sees you he just
[57:30] gets embarrassing she loves
[57:35] me how was it
[57:38] nobody but you make him somebody because
[57:41] you worship him you love him and the
[57:44] reason why you love him is because
[57:46] you're starting to see the fruits of the
[57:48] spirit living in you and more you love
[57:51] him the more he's going to give to you
[57:53] and before long it's going to fall on
[57:55] other people and when that
[57:57] happens you're fulfilling
[58:00] scripture the word of God through your
[58:04] life because now he has got a place to
[58:07] live in that he can produce the word
[58:11] through your lips okay this sinful
[58:16] body he's slapping the devil in the face
[58:19] cuz he thought you had you at
[58:23] Birth but Christ come
[58:27] well Glory through a spoken word and
[58:30] spoke the seed in a virgin born child of
[58:35] God and she produced Christ through her
[58:42] womb
[58:43] God was produced through spoken word
[58:48] through a body so that he can feel
[58:51] your
[58:53] trials all right through your pain
[58:57] boys you know he had to go to church
[59:00] too but he likeed going to church cuz he
[59:03] knew his father
[59:06] was don't you like bragging about your
[59:08] daddy he's cool a
[59:12] he you can look back and say man my
[59:14] daddy got
[59:17] muscles you guys can look and say my
[59:19] daddy he's got the
[59:24] looks you can look up daddy up there and
[59:26] say wooo he's got the big
[59:32] truck what is it that's your daddy
[59:36] you're proud of your daddy even if he
[59:38] gives you a good old spank and you still
[59:40] love him don't talk about my
[59:44] daddy it's because there's a love affair
[59:48] there and more we get in the word we
[59:51] find out how much Jesus loves us and
[59:55] it's so so much easier to serve a God
[59:57] that you love it's not because you have
[1:00:00] to it's because you want
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:04] to praise the Lord
[1:00:07] amen
[1:00:09] hallelujah and so here he
[1:00:13] goes I like this he say if a contractor
[1:00:17] laid out a plan for his men to build a
[1:00:20] house such and such way and each man
[1:00:23] ignored the blueprint that they build
[1:00:26] the house according to their way they
[1:00:30] could thought each man should build it
[1:00:34] the kind of a a house it would look like
[1:00:37] what would it look like without
[1:00:40] blueprints we'd be taking a lot of walls
[1:00:42] out something wouldn't fit we be buying
[1:00:46] more material cuz all that material that
[1:00:48] you put up has to come back
[1:00:50] out how many times do we forget the
[1:00:53] blueprint and we say oh we're Christians
[1:00:55] I know what to do and we go on and we do
[1:00:57] this and do that and we have to go oh
[1:00:59] man we got to go tear this house back
[1:01:01] down stick with the word and you'll have
[1:01:06] complete rest quit thinking so
[1:01:11] hard we've got to get into
[1:01:14] Unity more than anything that the church
[1:01:17] need is to get into the unity of the
[1:01:19] word because the unity brings other
[1:01:21] people into that unity and if we got
[1:01:24] Unity
[1:01:26] because if you have all the seals in
[1:01:29] you and you understand them all you can
[1:01:32] still split hell wide open but when you
[1:01:34] have the unity of the word laying down
[1:01:37] into your heart is because now you are
[1:01:40] doing exactly what God wants you to
[1:01:44] be and you have Heaven backing you up
[1:01:49] little police officers when you're tired
[1:01:52] of the devil say stop right there Devil
[1:01:54] he's got to stop not because of you it's
[1:01:58] because of who you belong
[1:02:02] to when he recognizes that
[1:02:05] Faith immediately cancer starts dying
[1:02:09] sicknesses start
[1:02:15] dying you young people quit thinking
[1:02:20] that nobody loves
[1:02:22] you because there's people out there
[1:02:24] that don't love you they don't love me
[1:02:26] so I stay away from them I go to the one
[1:02:29] that died for me the one that gave me a
[1:02:33] family to live with to come back to Pony
[1:02:37] America and be here and knowing that you
[1:02:39] guys love
[1:02:41] us amen we might not get to see each
[1:02:44] other very often but every once in a
[1:02:47] while I get a text from one of you I get
[1:02:50] almost a text almost every Sunday
[1:02:53] through brother
[1:02:54] wendle praying for for me you don't know
[1:02:57] what that does for a man is starting
[1:03:02] out these young people are starting out
[1:03:06] to be Christians loving God we should be
[1:03:09] encouraging them go and help them build
[1:03:12] the house show them an easier way to
[1:03:16] build it but stay with the
[1:03:18] blueprint
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:23] amen praise be to God but these guys
[1:03:25] they they went out and built this it'll
[1:03:28] be a crazy
[1:03:30] house but see if we go according to the
[1:03:35] blueprint then you'll be in the
[1:03:37] rest because he'll be living in you then
[1:03:41] praise the Lord second Peter 1 and two
[1:03:45] it says Grace and peace be multiplied
[1:03:48] unto you through the knowledge of God
[1:03:52] and our Jesus Jesus our lord according
[1:03:55] as his divine power ha given unto us all
[1:03:59] things that pertain unto life and
[1:04:01] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:04:05] that hath called us to glory and
[1:04:09] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:04:13] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:04:16] that by this he might be partakers of a
[1:04:20] divine
[1:04:23] nature what is this nature
[1:04:26] it's the Holy Ghost the word being
[1:04:30] planted into you changing your old
[1:04:33] nature out and putting him
[1:04:37] there because my Bible says when a woman
[1:04:40] and man gets married they're one when we
[1:04:43] get married to the word Jesus Christ
[1:04:46] we're one so the word is who now it's
[1:04:52] you from the foundation down deep in the
[1:04:56] ground way deep down there all the way
[1:04:58] from there to the last single upon that
[1:05:01] house it's a
[1:05:03] house it's his
[1:05:06] property yes that house is holding the
[1:05:10] master and whatever you
[1:05:14] say you bind from Heaven it'll be bound
[1:05:17] in heaven if you loosen it from Heaven
[1:05:19] it'll be loosened from Heaven you bind
[1:05:21] it on the earth it'll be bound but if
[1:05:23] you loosen it it'll be loose through
[1:05:26] your
[1:05:27] lips your Authority because now you are
[1:05:31] M Jesus
[1:05:33] Christ I got a quote with brother man
[1:05:35] say that's where we got to get to to
[1:05:38] realize that you call
[1:05:41] her Jesus Christ the
[1:05:46] word the
[1:05:52] bride how many of you men will let your
[1:05:54] wife go to the store and you're with her
[1:05:56] and some guy come up and start trying to
[1:05:59] talk to her first thing you do is hey
[1:06:01] buddy how you doing hey let me show you
[1:06:03] this um this stick over
[1:06:09] here she didn't say I do to you you
[1:06:12] don't have her ring on your ring on her
[1:06:14] finger it's mine stay away from
[1:06:21] her hello
[1:06:27] if you'll stay in God's business you
[1:06:29] won't even have to tell the devil to
[1:06:30] come out of your headache that's right
[1:06:33] because he's going to say okay devil
[1:06:35] that's enough get
[1:06:37] out and he'll have to
[1:06:40] leave why are we wrestling about these
[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:47] things we need to get into the Altar and
[1:06:51] cry out to God and get every wor word
[1:06:55] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:06:57] every promise in the book is
[1:07:00] mine and stand there and say devil no
[1:07:05] more I am through with you devil and
[1:07:12] March to your possessions that he given
[1:07:16] you for this
[1:07:18] body and then he goes on and he
[1:07:22] says having escaped the corruption
[1:07:26] that is in the world through
[1:07:28] lust here's your materials come on
[1:07:32] now and he says here he say besides this
[1:07:35] giving all diligence adding to your
[1:07:38] faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and
[1:07:41] to knowledge Temperance and to
[1:07:44] Temperance patience and to patience
[1:07:47] godliness and to Godliness brotherly
[1:07:51] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[1:07:55] charity
[1:07:57] this is the
[1:07:58] framework of the
[1:08:05] house faith is the
[1:08:08] foundation each one of these are the
[1:08:10] layers of each one of this house until
[1:08:13] the Capstone of Love Comes upon it and
[1:08:17] it's shingled over it's sealed no storm
[1:08:20] can get
[1:08:22] in oh church we got to get the place and
[1:08:25] build this
[1:08:29] house so the Capstone can come falling
[1:08:32] down upon
[1:08:33] it and the storms of life can't ever
[1:08:37] hurt it no more oh it'll beat it up a
[1:08:40] little bit on the outside but you open
[1:08:42] your garage door and you grab a little
[1:08:44] bit of tools and you go out there and
[1:08:45] you fix it maintaining it
[1:08:50] right some of us have built the house
[1:08:53] but you're letting it fall apart because
[1:08:55] you got too much nonsense in your
[1:08:58] brains thinking well I've been a
[1:09:00] Christian for 50 years I can sit back
[1:09:01] and relax and watch your house fall
[1:09:04] apart all right but it takes a
[1:09:06] maintaining amen that's
[1:09:10] right to keep it
[1:09:14] up you've
[1:09:15] got to get out of the
[1:09:18] bed and fight what's
[1:09:21] yours from The Winds of the world okay
[1:09:26] because it'll batter
[1:09:30] us because
[1:09:33] life is hard
[1:09:38] sometimes but sometimes we got to sit
[1:09:42] back and have a little
[1:09:47] patience say all right we got to take
[1:09:49] care of it this way and the way to take
[1:09:52] care of this
[1:09:54] situation is by the
[1:09:58] word and
[1:10:00] watch the correction happens and it
[1:10:03] won't cost you a
[1:10:07] dime little heartache but it ain't going
[1:10:10] to cost you a
[1:10:11] dime so all these millionaires you won't
[1:10:13] have to worry about it because all the
[1:10:16] millions and dollars is going to
[1:10:18] burn so I'd rather put my
[1:10:21] treasures in
[1:10:24] him because if I'm in
[1:10:28] him he said he'll be in
[1:10:31] me the hope of glory will be in me and
[1:10:36] if he's in me I'm a
[1:10:39] conqueror in Christ
[1:10:42] Jesus for if these things be in you and
[1:10:46] abound they make you that ye shall
[1:10:50] neither be Barren or
[1:10:53] unfruitful in the knowledge of of our
[1:10:55] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:04] woo 1 Corinthians 3 and 10 it says
[1:11:07] according to the grace of God which is
[1:11:09] given unto me as a wise master builder I
[1:11:15] have laid the foundation and another
[1:11:18] buth thereof yeah but let every man take
[1:11:23] heed how to buth thereof upon for other
[1:11:30] foundations can no man lay then that is
[1:11:33] laid which is Jesus
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:38] Christ now if any man build upon this
[1:11:43] Foundation gold and silver and precious
[1:11:45] stones wood and Haze stubble their Men's
[1:11:51] Work shall be made
[1:11:53] manifest for they for the day shall
[1:11:56] declare it because if because it shall
[1:12:01] be revealed by
[1:12:03] fire and the fire shall try every man's
[1:12:08] work in what sort it is if any man work
[1:12:13] abide which is hath built
[1:12:16] thereupon he shall receive a
[1:12:20] reward if any man work shall be burned
[1:12:24] he shall suffer
[1:12:26] loss but himself shall be saved yet so
[1:12:32] as five
[1:12:34] fire oh
[1:12:37] my let's St let's stick with the
[1:12:40] blueprints
[1:12:42] here storms are
[1:12:45] raging but you got it in
[1:12:47] you
[1:12:51] Hallelujah when a carpenter goes to
[1:12:53] build a house how does he do it lays Out
[1:12:58] All the lumber
[1:13:00] first he's got in his mind just what he
[1:13:04] going to build God had before the world
[1:13:09] was ever had to speak of life on it he
[1:13:14] had everybody laying right there did you
[1:13:18] hear
[1:13:19] me he had
[1:13:21] everybody every one of you he's talking
[1:13:24] to
[1:13:27] Church laying right there if it didn't
[1:13:32] where did it come from that's the reason
[1:13:35] he was twisted it and rolled it and
[1:13:39] turned it he would have it to the Sun
[1:13:43] this way and make potash and turn it
[1:13:48] back this
[1:13:50] way and the other ones he to make it a
[1:13:53] little faster and he just kept boiling
[1:13:56] it out here until he created
[1:14:01] Earth he created the heavens and he
[1:14:04] created all the stars he created the sun
[1:14:06] he created the moon those are types of
[1:14:09] the of of Jesus Christ and the bride
[1:14:13] right
[1:14:16] there what was he
[1:14:20] doing he was making a paradise for you
[1:14:23] and me to live in total
[1:14:29] rest a body that he can come down to and
[1:14:33] visit anytime he wants
[1:14:38] toless complete
[1:14:42] rest he turned it back th this
[1:14:45] way he did
[1:14:48] make these
[1:14:50] things for one
[1:14:52] purpose and that is to show his glory
[1:14:55] glory to you so that you can see that
[1:15:01] all these things he created for you was
[1:15:04] nothing compare to when he created
[1:15:08] you because he didn't marry that he's
[1:15:12] marrying
[1:15:18] you you ladies look across and see your
[1:15:20] little little
[1:15:23] hubby he married you
[1:15:29] husbands look
[1:15:31] across see what you
[1:15:37] married I told the church back home the
[1:15:41] greatest thing side salvation brother
[1:15:43] Brown said it was your
[1:15:48] wife how many can walk out this door
[1:15:50] tonight with her leave in her here and
[1:15:52] live with
[1:15:53] yourself you guys would be get in about
[1:15:55] a week some of you burn
[1:15:59] water some likes the
[1:16:02] microwave cook something supposed to be
[1:16:04] 20 seconds 3
[1:16:08] minutes
[1:16:12] boom thank God for our wives huh
[1:16:15] Hallelujah that was
[1:16:18] free what we got to fear about we should
[1:16:22] be the freest and happiest people people
[1:16:25] there is anywhere we don't have to guess
[1:16:29] about it God in our mix and proves it
[1:16:32] that's right it's according to his word
[1:16:35] and his Spirit now let's take it our
[1:16:39] bodies before there was even Earth was
[1:16:44] finished Beyond form our bodies that
[1:16:48] were lay living in right now was laying
[1:16:54] on that Earth Earth in
[1:16:56] potash and so
[1:17:02] forth when he created the Earth you were
[1:17:05] there and after the Earth had been
[1:17:08] shaped and all of it lay in there
[1:17:12] just a breach desert never had life on
[1:17:18] it never was nothing called life but all
[1:17:22] the materials was laying there to make a
[1:17:27] body and I can hear God say to the great
[1:17:31] Holy Spirit go forth now and Brew Over
[1:17:36] the Earth and now we have to use
[1:17:42] imagination here as we make a
[1:17:45] drama the great Holy Spirit went
[1:17:50] forth spread forth its wings over the
[1:17:53] Earth and begin to bre Brew for a
[1:17:57] purpose and that was to bring forth
[1:18:00] something to
[1:18:02] project what God
[1:18:04] was all
[1:18:07] right I want to
[1:18:09] run what was he projecting
[1:18:12] you because the heaven of Earth was
[1:18:15] coming down into you to
[1:18:19] perform all
[1:18:22] miracles show me any in the Bible where
[1:18:26] God himself made a made a miracle
[1:18:30] without a human
[1:18:34] body he brought the pillar of
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:39] fire but it took a person to be a
[1:18:42] walking
[1:18:43] Bible to prove that that light was there
[1:18:48] because some of us didn't get to see
[1:18:51] it but it had to be inspired
[1:18:55] by the Holy Spirit into you so that you
[1:18:58] could
[1:18:59] believe so that's why he had to create a
[1:19:03] soul that was from him that when it was
[1:19:08] energized it was going to produce the
[1:19:13] word
[1:19:15] wow manifested the Holy Spirit through
[1:19:21] you yes building a house for God
[1:19:26] is the greatest thing you could ever
[1:19:29] do and that is to get rid of all the
[1:19:33] junk the love of the world out of
[1:19:37] us because this thing's
[1:19:41] sticky this is so sticky it's just like
[1:19:44] those those um I can't remember the
[1:19:46] bushes but you walk by them and them
[1:19:49] them arms would just run out there and
[1:19:50] grab a whole to you and snag to you you
[1:19:53] guys know what I'm talking about
[1:19:55] and I mean they stickers they just grab
[1:19:58] a whole Tu and more you pull the more it
[1:20:00] gets on
[1:20:03] you but
[1:20:05] see how to get rid of
[1:20:08] that is you get a
[1:20:10] torch with a bunch of butane and you
[1:20:14] light that torch up and you
[1:20:16] go and you burn it all the way to the
[1:20:21] ground then you get your tractor and you
[1:20:23] scrape it off and you just keep on going
[1:20:25] until it's out of your
[1:20:30] distance so you got to take this flesh
[1:20:33] and burn it by the word of
[1:20:35] God so it burns the world out of us and
[1:20:40] that's why it's so important to cry out
[1:20:42] to God and let God come in there and
[1:20:45] burn everything that Satan has done at
[1:20:49] the beginning out of
[1:20:52] you cleanse you
[1:20:55] let him scrape you a little bit clean
[1:20:58] you
[1:20:59] up you're going to look a lot better
[1:21:02] when this five acres cleaned
[1:21:06] off you can start from that end or start
[1:21:08] to that end and drive by this is the
[1:21:10] Prest building on this
[1:21:12] road
[1:21:14] why because it was men and women that
[1:21:18] wanted to to do their very best to build
[1:21:23] a house of God so they can come and
[1:21:27] worship the
[1:21:29] Lord so what about our own
[1:21:32] flesh shouldn't we start taking care of
[1:21:35] it a little bit
[1:21:37] more right praise the
[1:21:40] Lord all right a house the foundation is
[1:21:44] first what is the foundation
[1:21:46] Christianity faith in the word of God
[1:21:49] the
[1:21:50] foundation then you begin to grow then
[1:21:54] start
[1:21:55] you begin to add to that
[1:21:58] Foundation now building a house I'm
[1:22:01] almost through now building a house you
[1:22:04] put your uprights and everything else
[1:22:08] the contractor here could tell us all
[1:22:11] about it but brother Ram goes on and
[1:22:13] goes he could he could teach you how to
[1:22:15] build a house but see but I going to
[1:22:19] tell you how to build a spiritual house
[1:22:23] where God can dwell
[1:22:25] he wants to dwell in you he wants to
[1:22:28] make you like himself he wants you to
[1:22:33] reflect
[1:22:34] reflecting rather he said of his being
[1:22:39] and that's what we're supposed to do
[1:22:42] reflect the Son of God now we're
[1:22:45] supposed to do his work he said he
[1:22:49] said he that believeth on me St John
[1:22:53] 14:7 he that believeth on me the works
[1:22:56] that I shall
[1:22:58] do also you're beginning to reflect the
[1:23:04] works of
[1:23:06] Christ more you put him in you the more
[1:23:09] you're going to reflect the love more
[1:23:13] you put into you you're going to reflect
[1:23:16] that Foundation that was
[1:23:18] built you're going to reflect the virtue
[1:23:21] you're going to
[1:23:23] reflect all all these
[1:23:25] attributes that God prepared for you to
[1:23:29] be because he was the great Foundation
[1:23:33] he was every one of these words that I
[1:23:36] just read a little while ago that
[1:23:40] you can have in your house this fleshly
[1:23:44] body here but see it's more than just
[1:23:47] your flesh Church remember you are a
[1:23:50] part of a church you are a part of a
[1:23:54] body
[1:23:55] that members come to to come to make one
[1:24:00] body called The Bride
[1:24:05] spiritually that's why we can't look at
[1:24:08] one another and see our
[1:24:11] faults when you see a brother in The
[1:24:13] Fault you lift him up but you don't know
[1:24:16] what he's done to
[1:24:17] me what' you do to God back in your 20s
[1:24:22] drinking and cussing and storming around
[1:24:25] and fighting and drinking and all kinds
[1:24:27] of wh Ming and things like that you're
[1:24:29] slapping him in the face every time we
[1:24:30] do something like that we're selfish if
[1:24:33] we don't have the love of God in us we
[1:24:36] don't have these attributes we need to
[1:24:38] find an altar and get these attributes
[1:24:40] in our house quickly tear it down start
[1:24:46] over build this house according to the
[1:24:49] blueprint and you will be a powerful
[1:24:53] Church the B
[1:24:55] says
[1:24:57] amen then after we lay the foundation
[1:25:01] secondly we add to that Foundation we
[1:25:05] add to the house Faith Peter said here
[1:25:09] add to your first you have faith then
[1:25:13] you add virtue then you add knowledge
[1:25:17] then you add Temperance then you add
[1:25:19] patience then you add godliness then you
[1:25:21] add brotherly kind then you you add
[1:25:25] charity house that you are
[1:25:28] building is it's this is your materials
[1:25:35] that you need to build your
[1:25:41] house very
[1:25:43] simple just got to be in
[1:25:47] prayer you know prayer is like
[1:25:50] studying do you know that I know I just
[1:25:53] blew your way
[1:25:57] because more you do it the more you want
[1:25:59] to do it because you're going to see
[1:26:02] results the more you read the Bible more
[1:26:05] results you're going to
[1:26:07] get the more you die out and let the
[1:26:09] word of God flow through
[1:26:12] you you're going to walk through this
