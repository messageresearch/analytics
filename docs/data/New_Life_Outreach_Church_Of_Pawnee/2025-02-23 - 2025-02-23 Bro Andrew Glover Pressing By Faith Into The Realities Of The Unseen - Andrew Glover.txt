for you maybe you're facing a mountain Mountain I believe God can move that mountain today Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Resurrection Sunday Lord to honor your Resurrection to honor you in the power of your Resurrection Lord we've not come here to fulfill a religious Duty or Lord to take up time on a Sunday morning but Lord there is a deep calling to the deep in our souls Lord father your Prophet has taught us that before there Lord was a creation there was a Creator to create the creation and this morning dear God we're standing here Lord as manifestations of your creation power lord inside of our souls is that creative thirst Lord and father as these Believers have gathered here today Desiring something from you Lord I as a man have nothing to offer but I know your word Lord it has the ability and the power to move mountains it has the ability and the power Lord to heal the sick to destroy the enemies oh God now Lord as we turn to your word this morning your word has never one time been defeated and this morning this Lord we have a firm and calm Assurance in our souls that it will not be defeated here today Lord it will accomplish that which you sent it for now Lord I pray that you would drive out every Spirit that's un like the Holy Spirit and Lord may your anointing come among us today in a special way Lord may you heal the sick Lord those that are not feeling well today dear God lord May the angel of God pass by their homes pass by their places where they are Lord Minister strength to them oh God Lord forgive us of our failures and shortcomings Lord this morning turn our attention now to your word and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray that all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you this morning you love the Lord today amen if you have your Bibles this morning we want to go in the word of the Lord to the book of St Luke the 16 chapter and while you're turning there today we do want to say it is a real honor to be here with you once again in in py Oklahoma and the amen to be here with brother wend and the church we sure appreciate the opportunity and uh invitation to be here and we just pray something can be said today to be a blessing to you and a help and sure glad to have my wife here with us and Malachi and amen just had a wonderful time last night and the couple's banquet there and want to thank all the work and effort laborers that went into that and just a wonderful time to together fellowship and amen it's always a always a special time to serve the Lord amen amen the book of St Luke the 16th chapter and in the 16th verse Jesus here speaking he says now the law and the prophets were until John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it so it's not going to be easy but every man is going to pray into it now in the book of Philippians the thir chapter Philippians chapter 3 and verse number 13 Philippians 3 and 13 Paul here writing in Philippians 3 And1 13 and he says now Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before so Paul is very very clear that there are some things behind the church but whatever is behind the church is not worth going back to it's actually worth forgetting to the point he would say forget those things that are behind you but reach forth unto those things which are before now watch how you're going to get there he says now I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so it's in front of you and you're going to have to press to get to it but you're not going to do it easily you're going to have to apply some force and press towards what God has said in front of you now in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 one other place I want to look this morning in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 13 Paul here writing again he says now we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I have now as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken he said now we also believe and therefore speak so the way a Believer presses forward is by believing the things that have been spoken in the same faith that they were spoken in look here in verse number 18 He says now while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal amen we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here today I want to uh by the help of the Lord for just a few moments from those verses of scripture if I would take a title here today I want to speak to you on this pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen amen pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen now in 1960 brother Bram preaches a very powerful sermon and he calls it the unfailing realities of the Living God the unfailing realities of the Living God and in that sermon brother speaking about how that people in the in the brandham Tabernacle there have been receiving the Holy Ghost and he said oh how many more that has received the Holy Ghost see it's begin to be a talk Among Us oh may it revive us to a spot notice may it revive us to a spot that we'll go to searching and hungering and pulling for the realities of God he said God is a reality amen I want to establish that this morning that God is a reality he's not he's not just a figment of our imagination he's not just an idol somewhere in another dimension but God is a reality another place in that sermon he said now the holy spirit amen will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another See it'll make each person come into its character see because it's a spirit that leads you it brings and makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature but it makes you subject to its nature and the Holy Spirit makes you live and love to do it he said oh how you love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in he said how it cleanses you and washes you and puts a desire in you to follow him and they thirst and a hunger amen for more of it see you're just bathing yourself he brings realities one other place in that sermon he said what we need today is men and women who wants a reality amen not a Creed but a reality that's what the world needs today is not Creeds and Fashions amen we need realities in God the world don't want it the world they don't want to accept it amen but the church has to have it listen the church has to have it amen God wants you to have it amen because he's the god of of reality listen we don't have to have a fancy building we don't have to have a big bank account we don't have to have a bunch of things but there's one thing we have to have as the Church of the Living God we have to have the reality of God Amen because anything apart from the reality of God is a Creed or a fashion or a tradition now when you start talking about this pressing when you look there at that word press it means to move or to cause to move into to a position of contact with someone amen or something by exerting a continuous physical Force when you look there at the word reality amen it is a thing that exists in fact having previously only existed in one's mind so when something has become a reality at one time it was just in the mind amen but now it is come into existence of course we know amen the most powerful force is God right remember said there's no more powerful force than God but then he brings that down to the believer and he says the greatest power in the world Amen is not the atomic bomb but it is a believer in contact with his maker amen it changes the whole attitude it changes his mental it changes his habit it changes his body it changes his nature amen it changes everything when a man comes in contact with God Amen the powerful force of God has the ability Amen to change everything about the man or the woman who has just come in contact with him now in 1949 brother's preaching there and he's speaking upon the subject of Science and he shows amen that there is a natural man amen and there is a spiritual man he said now I was just thinking of how that science how they are taking the natural man how he's went in the research from the fall amen of the natural he said and what he has done he said but how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of God he said I was thinking that the natural man went out to the Unseen of his ey and he pulled an adom down out of the sky and he split that adom in two and that destroys human life he said but if the natural man that knows nothing of God and cannot know nothing of God except he be converted amen then his soul becomes alive with the supernatural if he could do that in the natural realm amen then what ought the man of God to be doing see he said friends the church is so far behind amen let's pray that God will move his church up amen let's pray that God will move his church up the natural man with the natural resource is getting greater results than people are amen that call themselves Christian he said now let's press into the Unseen amen let's press into the Unseen the blessings are yours they are there for you so a prophet identified With the blessings that belong to a Believer are dwelling amen they're not dwelling in this visible realm but they are dwelling in The Invisible realm and the only way you're going to get there is you're going to have to press listen God is not going to bring these unseen blessings into this visible real and just hand them to you but you're going to have to press against the force of devils and the force force of darkness and the force of unbelief listen but a prophet said they're there and if you'll put forth some effort you will break through and you will possess what God has ordained you to possess in the age that you're living in now when I think of this brother R preaches it about three different times and he actually tells us you got to look amen at the Unseen a prophet didn't just come and tell us something but he told us what we got to look at he said you got to look at the Unseen very power ful quote looking at the Unseen 1950 he said now we look at the Unseen and we believe that those things which are unseen amen but spoke of by God Amen they become realities amen we look at the Unseen and believe that those things which are unseen amen but spoke of by God Amen they become realities amen so the spoken word is what makes a difference in what Bec a reality and what don't amen if it has been spoken of by God Amen there's going to be somebody believe it and it's going to become a reality 1963 uniting time and sign he said those three Magi isn't it strange amen that these stars were exactly in line amen for three men but nobody else saw it he said now you can be so in line with the scripture when those stars become in unity amen they United themselves together in this constellation amen three men were also United at the same time he said and you can be so United with God in his word until these things become reality and you can see them and know that they are true another place he said but impossible things are made real amen when God is took at his word amen The Impossible is made realities when God is taken at his word listen friends I think it's time to quit settling amen for shadows and types when we have been promised the reality I think it's time to quit selling for whatever the devil hands us amen I think it's time to get some grit about us I think it's time to get a backbone about us I think it's time to draw a sword amen and start pressing back against the Demons of Darkness that don't want you to possess amen what God died for you to possess he died that you could have joy he died that you could have peace he died that you can have Victory he died that this church could have a Revival and every devil in hell has done everything they can Amen to conquer the Church of the Living God but I say away with Satan's Doom and Gloom and up with the power of the Holy Ghost In the Flesh of the Church of God believe in the hard things but watching them become realities my when God is taking his word you say God is taking at his word amen what is it church it's the infallibility amen of God's spoken word brother said if this audience tonight amen could only get settled in their mind of who said this amen what this reality is amen this spoken word we would need a healing service we wouldn't need a Salvation altar call it would be finished if you just realized amen what the word was come on before it could be a word spoken it had to be a thought but because a word is a thought manifest when God speaks he said now then back in the beginning when God looked down through the corridors of heaven and he saw all these things were going to happen on Earth did you ever just sit and draw a picture out in your mind he said now that's the way God did it perhaps in the beginning and then it seemed good to him amen so he spoke it and as soon as it was spoken it became a word and the thought was expressed in a word now listen once God expresses his thought and makes it a word he can never take it back amen when God stresses his thought and makes it a word he can never take it back come on church but all the difference is is who said it listen it matters who said something it determines how much stock you're going you look good it determines what stock you're going to put in it amen can I say it to you like this amen if you go down here to the coffee shop amen and you're sitting there and some guy drinking coffee just hollers out we're going to war well you just laugh at that walk out and move on with your life but if the president stands up and says we're going to war everybody stops and starts thinking about it see because it determines who said it listen it wasn't a preacher that said you were the bride it wasn't a preacher that said you had the power to overcome it wasn't a preacher that said these things it was God that spoke these things I think it's time to quit putting a little stock in I think it's time to invest everything we are in the word that God has spoken in the age that we're living in my before the foundation of the world Jesus spoke these things and somebody is going to become the material or the reality of the thoughts that he thought and the words that he spoke yes sir my goodness amen you say Well when was it thoroughly paid for it was thoroughly paid by Jesus Christ and you accepted it and as long as God accepted Christ he accepted you with Christ and when did he do it before the foundation of the world when he spoke him into existence he spoke you redeemed with him when God spoke the lamb into existence as the same time that he spoke you as the redeemed amen by the one who he was speaking into existence to do the redeeming my church then that brings it down to this that we're not just human beings we're actually a two-fold being see there is an outward man brother said and then there is an inward man he said now the outward man looks by his eyes amen but the inward man looks by faith amen now notice this the outward man is self but the inward man is God oh Church the outward man is self but the inward man is God he said you do not see with her eyes though many times we thought we with our eyes amen we only look with our eyes amen but we see with our heart see brother said oh Christians amen pinch the Inside Man now and wake up to the reality that Jesus Christ is here Amen to manifest himself to you listen there is a reality of God that is not a Million Miles Away folks it's right here in this building this morning and if you can pinch your conscience and awaken the inside man to see that there is more than just humans in here there is more than just preachers in this building but there is a Angelic host that it filled this building this morning and they're not sent here to condemn you come on we're all humans we make mistakes we have faults and we have failures but the angels of God are sent Amen to The Heirs of Salvation Amen to minister good things unto you my goodness I think it's time to quit selling underneath This Cloud of depression and and oppression and condemnation and amen I know we've all made mistakes amen but somewhere or Another You Got to Believe In The Blood or not and I tell you what the blood is it's a powerful blood it's an authoritative blood it has the ability to erase the sin and to fold in the sea of forgetfulness and to open up a new chapter to you you say well I'm 60 or 50 or 40 years old hey there is no age limits on the blood of Jesus Christ it can reach to an old man can reach to a young man my wake up to the reality that Jesus Christ is here and he's here Amen to manifest himself to you I believe it folks I believe the time has come amen for the Believers to move I believe it's time to come for us to press amen but to press forward prophet of God said what we got to do is we got to press forward and we got to take the promise that God Almighty has given us he said see what we are under is we are under a Divine commission that is a Divine commission Amen to possess Divine promises remember said a man that's commissioned of God Amen he looks upward and onward you don't have to care what the world says about it anyhow he's not listening to the world he's got a Divine commission from God and he is enjoying the presence of God listen a man that is commissioned of God he don't look behind him a man that's commissioned of God he don't look to the to the left or to the right but a man that is commissioned of God has One Direction he looks that is onward and upward see because the Holy Ghost amen knows your destination he knows what the power of God is calling you to and he's here Among Us I'll say this he's not just here to make us shout he's not just here to make us dance or feel good but he's here to make us perseverant because if there's anything that we need in this hour is we need pers persevering Christians if there's anything we need in this hour amen is perseverant preachers we need perseverant churches we need perseverant young people listen it's going to get harder and it's going to get harder and it's going to get harder but brother Kobe there's going to be Believers that's going to get stronger and they're going to get stronger and they're going to get more determined listen I want to tell that devil I'm not quitting I'm not quitting devil throw everything you want to against me pile everything up against me you want to but I'm not quitting because there is a perseverance in my soul I've got a destination to go to I've got a goal to make brother said then every Christian amen should be very perseverant in their claims towards god listen I say this we're not just pressing but we're actually pressing toward something which is the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus he said to the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity amen when Jesus comes another place we're not going to have a rearview mirror Affair see a rearview mirror Affair only looks back to see where you've been but it's not looking back to see where you've been we're looking forward to see where we're going amen see because the scripture did promise things back there but it also promises things here and it promises things ahead of the church what are we doing we are pressing into the Fulfillment of scriptural promises listen folks the Rapture is a scriptural promise and somebody is going to persevere they're going to press and they're going to press and they're going to press and they're going to make it by the grace of God we find them the only way to advance is to press Paul or rather Jesus said amen the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it that word presses means to use and to apply Force I love what Paul said he said in first Corinthians 9 I therefore so run amen not as uncertainly amen so fight I amen not as one that beateth the air so that tells me Church we're not fighting flesh and blood but we are fighting Spirits we are fighting powers and principalities and demons of darkness and come on we're fighting things but let me say this amen it's time to fight it's not time to quit it's time to fight Jesus said every man presses into it amen not just simply walks into it easily but it's got to be pressed into now this desperation brother preaches about what it does is it causes you to press now it's not a fearful or a begging desperation but it is a desperation with a sense of urgency Amen brother said see since then the Kingdom of Heaven has been preached and Men press into it you don't just stand around and say pick me up by the father Lord and push me on in no you press into it you get desperate it's between life and death now look here R man preaches the sermon 1963 desperations and he opens his Prayer by saying this I want to speak tonight on giving them courage to encourage them to take that god-given ride they have a right to defeat the Devil he is already defeated you have a right to defeat the Devil he is already defeated and he is just bluffing them he said but I'm claiming them Father now help me to speak the word amen you speak through me Lord with this few notes I got wrote down here and little scriptures wrote out I pray that you'll help me Lord amen and get in the word and give them faith for the glory of God so a prophet was inviting amen the author of this word amen to come to the platform and to get in the sermon that he was preaching but let it be more than a sermon Let It Be An empowering Let It Be A Feeling let it be a surge of faith into the hearts of the Believers to recognize their enemy is already defeated and they've got a right to defeat him oh church but listen the only way they're going to do it is by faith look here in Hebrews 11:1 Paul says that faith is the substance of things hoped for is the evidence of Things Not Seen amen for by it the elders obtained a good report now watch this and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God Amen so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear reben comes along and he said now listen you testify of the things you do not see my goodness because faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things you do not see and we look at the Unseen so a Christian does not testify of what you see you testify of what you don't see in other words we can see the problem we can see the trouble we can see the issue but that's not what we talk about we talk about the things we don't see because the things we don't see are more real than the things we do see now come on folks you see the problems and you see the issues and you see the troubles and you see the sickness and you see the chains of sin and you see all the issues amen but listen that's not what we talk about because the Bible said the things we see are temporary come on but the things we don't see are Eternal so what we see that's temporary could be here today and it could be gone tomorrow somebody say why don't you talk about the problem more because the problem could change while I'm talking about it because I can see it and it's temporary but I'm going to talk about something that never changes and that's the word of God that's the promises of God he said see faith is something amen that's born in you it's something that God gives you amen faith is Supernatural and it does Supernatural things he said then that faith comes in amen here at the bottom of the pyramid he said then that spiritual Faith amen it recognizes only the word amen no matter what anybody else says it don't do no good amen that Faith only knows the word look here in perfect Faith he said faith is something that you have to believe it's there come on folks you got to go beyond Believing by what you see you got to go beyond Believing by the way you feel you got to go beyond the way Believing by the way things imagin or the way you're reasoning things amen faith is something you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but Faith see what is Faith he says it's an unseen foresee amen it's a spirit and the Holy Spirit brings Faith another place he said oh you claim you got faith but you know when Jesus becomes the Lord of your faith then all of his words become real to you when Jesus becomes the Lord of your Faith then all of his words become real to you another place when God takes the Holy Spirit and brings that word to you and makes it alive to you a reality that your faith amen stand up and claim it come on you say well I'm praying for a miracle when the word makes the reality oh come on when the word makes your faith a reality that's the time to stand up and to claim whatever God has made real to you you say well brother Andrew I can't see it that don't make no difference it don't have to be real in this visible realm if you can see it in the Unseen then God has the power to bring it into reality in the visible come on church amen when the prodical son come home that wasn't the that first day his daddy ever claimed he was coming home when he was down there in the big pin his daddy claimed he was coming home when his daddy couldn't seem back after father father's table his daddy still claimed he was coming home oh may I say to you tonight or this morning there is a faith seed in this bride of Christ we don't have to hear it we don't have to see it or feel it or smell it or reason it to believe it we are a part of Abraham's seed Hallelujah we believe it when our flesh is against us we believe it when our spirit is against us we believe that when things are against us we believe the things we don't see come on folks either you believe it or not either you believe it or not either somewhere you're going to say devil you've controlled me my My Five Senses long enough come on either we believe what a prophet said or we don't either we believe that we are controlled by a super sense which is the six sense or we don't but I believe we are I believe we are a little faith woman who believes God on the mountain and we believe him in the valley we believe him when the sun is shining and we believe him when the rain is falling we believe him when the clouds are gathering and we believe him when the birds are singing We are believers from our soul when God takes that holy spirit makes that word to you and makes it alive to you makes it a reality that your faith stand up and claim it listen to what he said you don't have to feel nothing you don't have to see nothing but you do have to believe something something now I'm just going to gohe and preach since I drove all the way out here you don't have to see nothing or feel nothing but you do have to believe something and I tell you right now and then these guys running around knocking Doctrine ought to be careful what they're opening the door to amen the day you start knocking the doctrine of this message is the day you open up the door to feelings and Sensations and emotions but this is one country preacher that will not quit preaching the doctrine of the restoration of the word of God in the age I'm living in because it's the only defense I have against the Demons of Hell somebody say we don't need doctrine well I tell you what we do need is we need something to Anchor Us in the time of confusion and our feelings ain't going to do it and our Sensations and emotions ain't going to do it folks it's going to take the word of God which is the absolute to this generation to Anchor the Church of the Living God you don't have to see nothing you don't have to feel nothing but you do have to believe something see what is Faith it is the evidence of Things Not Seen Bible says this by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet he moved with fear and he prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and he become the heir of righteousness which is by faith watch this the Bible said things not seen in the Amplified Bible that phrase Things Not Seen is actually translated notice this to events not yet seen so a thing not seen is an event not yet seen brother B says before there was a cloud before there was a drop of water in the skies amen Noah with the Unseen of the natural eye with his spiritual eye amen tuned to the word of God he's seen the rain fall falling oh tonight if we could get our hearts tune the word of God to see a Revival break forth to see the altars full to see the church packed to see the Revival spreading through Los Angeles a fire that cannot be put out our hearts would begin to pulsate under the power of the Holy Ghost he said there would be such a prayer meeting over Los anges amen it would have to happen certainly it would when this church is in tune what if the people here tonight that's sick would begin to think God is God and if he isn't want I serve him but if he's still God he still a Healer if he's almighty God he can do all things and if he made a promise he cannot break it he has to keep it then that pulsation begins to rise in your heart amen something is going to take place there could be nothing stop it see it's like a fire it's like a building on fire on a windy day it just keeps blowing as the Holy Spirit fanss the fire now listen and that fire keeps burning until it becomes a reality to you come on Church the fire of God has got to be ignited sometime in the soul of a Believer let me say this I think if we ever get the fire ignited we don't have to go back and reignite it we just got to maintain the fire that has been ignited you say how do I do that amen something has got to Fan the Flames every now and again amen something has got to keep the fire burning come on church I know it's easy to get cold it's easy to get in an indifferent condition listen we're humans well I might as well just preach we're humans and we go through things we go through trials and we go through disappointments we go through letdowns listen sometime or another you got to realize every mistake you made ain't taking you out every sometime you got to realize every failure and every ever ever ever stump of your toe you made it's not your end it's time to get up and dust yourself off and say I'm going to press on in the name of Jesus he said I was an overcomer he said I was an invincible Army he said I was a messiah he said I was a devil Slayer he said I was a serpent Bruiser he said I would put my foot on the head of every enemy and Bruise the devil under my heel shortly that's what he said and I believe what he said so I'm going to believe it when I don't feel it I'm going to believe it when I don't see it I'm going to believe it when I don't hear it because I am a believer from from my soul I believe in the authority of the word of faith Hallelujah therefore when we see promised in the Bible we believe it's soul body and spirit it's impossible for him to lie now if there's any fault if it's in us if there is it's in us it's not in God my goodness so then it's by the word of faith that we press remember said the word of faith which we preach love this we must preach the word of faith what Paul wrote to Timothy he said preach the word he said be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine let me just say what a prophet said he said I love to see God heal his children certainly don't get me wrong but one reason I've been notice and if you no this lately I've been trying everywhere I go when I get an invitation is to pray s to preach just a little bit I've let down on my preaching and it's putting too much on just the anointing and working on the Eternal part of the supernatural rather that when to see Visions now they're wonderful and I thank God for it how many thanks God for Visions amen you thank God for Visions how many believes in Visions we believing Visions see but watch yet the preaching of the word is a million miles beyond that brother wend the preaching of the word is a million miles Beyond SE and a vision he said see when I see the lame walk and the blind see now watch a prophet he said the success of the church amen lies within the preaching of the Gospel of the power of God and the demonstration of the spirit so the success of a church is not it's a it's not its a its ability to be known or its ability to grow or it's come on Church somebody say well the church ain't growing well let me say this growth is no sign amen that God is with the church or not because the prophet of God said prostitution went up amen 80% he said is god with prostitution absolutely not so we cannot let the devil amen narrow our vision down and just only see the way certain things are we've got to see the whole picture listen I'd rather have five people on fire with the Holy Ghost and the word being preached and demons being cast out and sick being healed and dead being raised and to have 500 Hypocrites you got to attend to every hour of your life come on folks this is the word of God the success of the church lies within the preaching of the Gospel I remember I remember I first started preaching that quote got me in trouble man I was preaching that preach the message preach the message and I went somewhere and I was preaching one day and I said a successful Church to me is a church that preaches the message well that was one of them come see me after service sermons you know amen Pastor want to talk to me and what he wanted to tell me was the success of his church was his visions and his Supernatural and his gifts and I said brother that's all well and good but a prophet right here said the success of the church amen lies within the preaching of the Gospel said it very beautiful he said so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word word of God faith cometh by hearing not by seeing a vision you say why do you say that because if you don't have faith if somebody will begin to preach the gospel the Bible said Faith cometh ain't that something if you don't have faith when the word begins to be preached Faith cometh he said see you can only serve God on Earth as it's God's servants that sent on Earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you he said now watch therefore he sent anointed preachers to preach the word and you received it another place he said Christ does not anoint ministers to preach the gospel just to have it returned back to him void but he expects you to receive the word and in receiving the word he says be ready so as you receive the word you become the word that's why Jesus said in his last commission he said preach the gospel he said cast out devils in my name lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I know you know these things but can I just say it very plainly the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil you say really yes sir why not a vision because a vision could be an illusion and an illusion is connected to your imagination that's why we do not follow every life that shows up in a picture come on folks that's why we don't follow every Vision that's why we don't believe every man that says they had a conversation with the angel we have been given a year a folks we have been given a message and it's the message of the hour and everything we believe every step we make every turn we turn we judge it by the infallible word of the spoken God himself from the age that we're living in come on somebody say well I don't think imaginations are very powerful they're more powerful than you give them Authority for being they're more powerful than you give them credit am I might as well just preach it's here amen the preach of the Gospel is not an imagination it is the infallible word of almighty God and the devil can mess with your imagination but there is one thing he cannot Prevail over and that is the revelation of Jesus Christ that has been revealed in the hour that we're living in I know what I'm talking about imaginations run wild with people come on and I'll just say this imaginations become real but only to the person that has them you know what I'm talking about brother B said you imagine somebody don't like you and he said you'll start shunning them he said then you'll start ignoring them he said then before long you just are so convinced that they don't that that that they don't like you and he said see what's happened it's become real to you so that's like brother Kobe I get my mind you don't like me okay brother Kobe don't like me I shook his hand he didn't say nothing I S I told him he good did a good job lean singing he didn't even thank me he don't like me he don't like me that's one Sunday so let's go the next Sunday and the next Sunday I say oh brother Kobe he don't like me because today he looked at everybody in the crowd and said good morning he ignored me he don't like me so let's go a month out now okay now we're a month out Amen brother Kobe don't like me he don't like me he a he a he ain't even acknowledged me in a whole month come on Church brother Kobe don't like me now listen I've made that real to myself but you know why that brother Kobe is not believing that because it's not real to him it's real to me but it's not real to him and now watch folks when something becomes real to somebody and nobody else that's when they get mad oh God because it's real to them and nobody else and they start applying pressure and saying things and gossiping and calling and oh God I might as well preach are you hearing me what it is it's the power of imagination and when it becomes real to you it becomes so real that it's real to everybody in the church and in reality it's not real to nobody but you I've been there church have you been there it's real nobody but you that's why the gospel has got to be preached because it's the only thing that has the power and the authority to break that spirit and to cast it back into hell where it come from imagination won't do it it takes the word of God and if the word is not preached that devil will find a stronghold in every church every family every marriage every youth group come on folks I think it's time to draw our sword and say that devil will not live in my church he will not live in my family he oh Hallelujah he will not live in my marriage he will not live in our young people that devil of imagination will find this place this morning that's subject to the word of God and the authority of the Holy Ghost imaginations will run wild with you but the prod of God said see what we've got is we've got the power and the authority to break that spirit we have the power and the authority Amen to break that spirit so what does brother say he said the only thing God can do then is to shock you or to bring you to an understanding that he is still God and keeps his promise so in doing so he anoints preachers that's These Fine men standing around here and many back there he anoints them to preach yes sir he don't anoint them to feel I feel something ooh he don't anoint them to see oh I see I see he anoints them to preach now let me just say this the BR of God makes it very beautiful and and let me let me back up a second somebody say well I'm not going back down to that church no more because nobody likes me do You Realize unless you've asked everybody from the oldest Elder to the to the to the baby if they love you you've lied come on you realize that unless you've asked every unless you went around to every single member of the church and said do you love me do you love me do you love me do you love me unless you done that and you walk off and say well ain't nobody don't the church loves me you're lying because you've not asked nobody but can I tell you this if you do ask everybody from the oldest of Elders to the youngest of babies and they all tell you they don't love you and you walk off and say nobody in that church loves me you're still lying you know why because there's one in the building his name is Jesus Christ and he's a member of this church he's a faithful member he's here when you're not he's here when you let every excuse keep you out of the house of God he's a faithful member and listen I don't care if the oldest oh God I don't care if the oldest Elder hates me and the baby thrs up every time I walk by if Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is in the church I got somebody that loves me brother Merl I got somebody for me I got somebody behind me I got somebody pressing me on what are you saying I say it's time to become conscious it's time to become conscious of the spirit that's near us he says and break out of the shell come on folks break out of the shell of the hour we're living in and the time and be conscience of the spirit of God that is now Among Us said very beautiful in St John 14 he reads it yet a little while and the world which is the unbeliever he seeth me no more but ye which is the believer see me because I which is Christ live ye shall live also he said listen to his going away low a little while in the world brother stops and says the visible intellectual cultured scientific the world will see me no more that's exactly a prophecy it can't help but be the truth Jesus Christ said it now watch he said I Christ in his church I love how brother BR makes this statement here I Christ in his church energizing bringing the same things that he did when he was here on Earth and by the way Kobe likes me and I like him as he did in all days G by he is in the church tonight to do the same thing another place and the Christ that sends the man goes with him and is in him see Jesus Christ in his church his branches energizing them bringing forth the same fruit he brought when he was here on the earth so when he come to the church in the last days he will come in the fullness of the light of the Sun so the god that sends the man go goes in the man and he goes in the man in the form of light see that's why the pro of God said this when you really realize amen that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there is nothing in the world is going to defeat you in it amen that's all you are absolutely undefeatable not you but the god that's in you not Christ not the body but the word that was in him see not Mary but the word that was born from her okay when you really realize the truth of the thing it's not you it's the word that is in you how many knows there's times that God makes things so real to you you never forget it amen amen sister jene I remember the day that quote become real to my heart it was out there in a field in Virginia and brother Duran was preaching up here on that trailer you probably remember that during coed when we had to do crazy things like have church in the field under under but them were good times amen amen out there preaching and he was just preaching along I think he was preaching on the godhead and this this quote wasn't even in his notes it wasn't even there and he's just preaching along and he said I just read a quot this morning and I just and he just stopped and he said y'all forgive me and he got his cell phone out now it wasn't amen a lot of people that said well that ain't po penut but to me it was a Damascus Road experience he got his phone out and we sat there and took time to find that quote and he read that quote I never will forget as long as I live amen Batton Parkinson's amen had to be helped up the steps to preand but he stood there and said this he said I feel like Caleb this morning I'm undefeatable in the promise of God what are you saying I'm saying church if a man battling Parkinson's amen knows how to do war with that devil and what about every one of you sitting here this morning it's time to get off your pity party if you fallen in sin it's time to repent of the the thing and let the blood wash you clean but for the love of God get up off your pity party and recognize who you are you are undefeatable you're undefeatable church not you but the word the word the word that was born in you see then what are we preaching we're not preaching your feelings we're not preaching my imagination we're preaching the word of faith and the Word of Promise but it has now been revealed see what it is it is an entrance amen it is an entrance P Peter said an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you say what is an entrance an entrance is an exit as well now can I just be quite honest with you you got to leave some things Church yeah you're going to have to leave some things if you're going to go forward brother Miguel into what God has called you to go into to enter something you've got to exit something and brother said this he said the Believers are Kingdom people now watch here he said now let's now let's see someday amen I'm just going to take a moment read this he said this after this matter Matthew 6 after this manner therefore you pray ye Our Father which is in heaven art in heaven Hallowed be thy name watch what he says thy kingdom come thy will be done somebody say done thy will be done in earth and brother Kobe he didn't say on Earth he said in Earth what are you your Earth but the will of God would be done in your Earth listen as it is in heaven look at this word done it means come to pass it means be fulfilled now listen it means to be married to Oh Glory to God so there there there is a marriage taking place in your Earth brother said if he was called Messiah because he was anointed with the Holy Spirit and any church that Anointed with the same holy spirit is a messiah at a little or smaller God and someday when this body is resurrected I hope before for hand that God can get a hold of a bunch of people that will manifest his power in every Dimension that it's supposed to be in see Messiah anointed one a King to deliver you the Kings and Priests you are Kings to bring in you are preach to minister to a messiah and his signs was to follow in all ages reflecting his light his presence with his kingdom people come on you're not just citizens upon the Oklahoma folks you are Kingdom people you are Earth that has been redeemed by God and he has chose to marry there is a marriage that is taking place in your earth hallu oh God he said let's turn our now I love how he says this he said let's turn our cameras this morning how many wants to turn your cameras he says and let's look on up yonder in heaven break out of this Dimension okay and look up yonder now we're all humans we have our good days we have our bad days we have our ups we have our downs we have our trials we have our situations our problems we go through things we're all human some days we feel like we having coffee with angels well one person does and other days you feel like you're lower than a snake's belly we're human but here's the problem is when we get used to what's going on around us and it becomes so common that we forget there's something else happening somewhere else like I was over back in December I I just I'll just say this I was over in North Carolina preaching and I got hit really hard with a sciatic nerve and having a bunch of issues actually at me in California and then I was over in North Carolina at Josh Bennetts and that that Sunday night Josh had to come to the hotel about midnight and take me to the hospital just absolute pain and it was so much pain I couldn't hardly walk couldn't turn couldn't get some of y'all de with that know what I'm talking about couldn't get comfortable but problem was it was real cold and rainy outside and I had a flight on Monday so brother Joy all all I was trying to do was get enough relief to get on that plane and fly out well well Monday rolled around it was still rainy and cloudy and Dre and I was still hurting and Tuesday rolled around raining cloudy and dreary and I was still hurting and Wednesday God gave us enough Grace to get to get ourselves together and get to the to the airport and I got to the airport and I just knew Josh brother Josh I just knew when I woke up Wednesday morning it's going to be sunny there W going to be no rain wasn't going to be no clouds I was going to go the airport and it's going to be 50° the birds was going to be singing I was going to get there early brother Miguel I was going to get me a coffee and goingon to get a donut everything gonna be great see I was imagining things had all this imagine it's going to get there and I I was going to return my real car I was going to be good enough I wasn't have to worry about walking I mean had all this imagin so I went to bed Tuesday night and brother John had all these imaginations and and I woke up the next morning the first thing I ever did was open the curtains there in the hotel and there was the rain and there was the clouds and there was the dreariness and there was the darkness and there was and I just settled back down under it you know I just said well I guess this is the way it's going to be so I got the got the airport you know how you get that you get in those times and every little thing just gets under your skin went to the counter and the woman of all days I mean Delta I don't want to brag but Platinum Medallion member you're supposed to get an extra two pounds folks I was 51 and she said $100 how and it gets under your skin now you're ready to let her have a piece of your mind I fly with you all all the time and yeah she finally said well sir let me see what I can do well you going to do something it wasn't her it was me all right it was what I had settled under come on Church got down to the gate supposed to have an exit row seat and got up there and you don't have an exit row you got a middle seat in the well problem was when I realized that I got mad at her I realized I was flying on American and not Delta so I don't have no status with American so man I'm sorry here's your $100 it's the way it's going to be Kobe it's rainy cloudy dreary cold dark got on the plane got my seat we took off I opened the window there's the rain there's the clouds there's the cold I just closed the window and I just settle down in my seat and we took off and we're flying and all of a sudden I start feeling a warmth I start feeling the warmth I said where in the world is that and I just looked over and I just barely open the open the window and I had to shut it real quick because the sunlight was so blinding I open that I open that window open that that that shade back up brother John and there was the sun five minutes ago I was ill I was bothered every little thing was getting on my nerves I had settled down it was always going to be this way but just a few seconds and it all changed are you hearing me just a few seconds and on the other side of the clouds the sun was still there come on that's why your imagination cannot be your absolute the way you feel cannot be your absolute the way you settle down to accept things that cannot become the absolute of your life you got to remember brother on the other side of the clouds the sun is shining the rain is dried up there's a new atmosphere oh New Life Outreach I say to you this morning it's time to rebuke them imaginations and remember who you are remember on the other side of this trial the sun is still shining Hallelujah he said we get so used to things down here listen what he says and when things look so dreary here on there's always something going on in Another World Church it's time to quit letting the devil beat you up listen the sphere of faith that other world is this okay that other dimension is under the Dominion of the six sense which only belongs to the Christian and it is superior to all other senses he said see the super sense is the holy spirit which is the faith of God that dwells in you and if you'll let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it'll guide you and bring all other five senses under control of that super sense for it is so far above the natural sense as the spiritual man is above the natural it is as far and as high as the heavens is above the natural man and his five senses now listen it makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about listen the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his reach see that come from God it's called faith and faith is that great thing so this six sense comes to make the five senses deny anything contrary to God's word God's promise see what Paul says he says casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ look at this word high thing it is a barrier or a rampart or a bullwark now what is knowledge is one of the virtue see knowledge of God is the revelation of God not a worldly knowledge but a Heavenly knowledge St perfect man then if you got Heavenly knowledge you believe the word and you reason anything by the word see when you catch that Revelation it's time to press beyond the barrier of circumstances it's time to press beyond the bullwark it's time to press beyond the rampart it's time to press beyond the hindrance see he he said oh look here amen them demons have to recognize what sphere you're entering into how many could say this morning Lord help me to change spars help me to change Realms help me to change Dimensions help me to move into a place in God where the five senses of inner and outer can no longer control me help me Lord now I'll just I'll just say this to you I love studying the discernments on tape how many enjoys those sometimes I'll sit there and listen to him and I'll watch him and read him and listen to him over and over and you know how the Lord is when you're studying brother when he'll start opening things to you and I was listening to one the other day and he says this in 1951 he says Thou Art here Lord and this devil knows his time has come he said to this woman now I I I know that we would take this and say well it's just one single woman sitting here on the plat for but but brother Bram said you're a little faith woman so is that okay if I make you this woman would that be all right to this woman entering into this sphere of Faith here oh God she's moving out of this sense bound existence into the sphere or the realm where faith is in control to this woman entering into this sphere of Faith here he knows he's got to lose he cannot hold her any longer now watch what he says Thou death Spirit come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ I charge thee to leave the woman now somebody say well brother Andrew how can you make that the bride and and it be a death spirit because do you realize a deaf Spirit does not just affect your hearing it also affects your speaking and you know what Paul said he said I have believed so therefore I speak so the way a Believer presses forward is by believing something and then speaking what they believe in the same Spirit of Faith they heard it him come on church she could hear he said thou death spirit so there is a connection between the hearing and the speaking it depends on if that now how many knows that de Spirit contacts a nerve and that death spirit will paralyze that nerve and you can hear something and still be deaf and not be able to speak come on folks I had a cousin bless her heart she was deaf she sit in the car ride with you all day long hear everything you said but she could not repeat it back to you she could not talk back to you she could not speak it back because she was deaf connected to her speaking can I say this to you that moves from the natural to the spiritual to this little faith woman sitting here do you realize there's a deaf spirit that wants to connect itself to every one of your spiritual ears he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church do you realize the devil wants to connect his Spirit to your you're hearing so it will change the way you're speaking come on folks it'll change the way you're confessing things it'll CH come on Amen you know what a de Spirit can do it can it can change the way you hear things and make you say it differently than the way you heard it come on you know what I'm talking about somebody walk by and say good morning how are you if there's a death Spirit there well they insulted me no they didn't it's the way you heard it because there was something didn't want you to hear it the way they said it because they wanted to bring a disconnection between you and that person oh I guess it's just the Evangelist coming out they wanted to affect the way you was hearing but can I tell you what the prophet said he said thou deaf spirit I adure Thee to come out of her I'm not going to read it to you I'm GNA preach it to you you know what he said next he said if you can hear me then say Amen if you can hear me then say amen and that Death woman speaks out on tape and she says these words amen which was a sign she could now hear because what she was hearing she was now speaking and she was saying the same thing she was hearing hallelujah oh folks are you hearing me are you hearing me it's time to start listing them tapes again but without a de Spirit on your ear it's time to hear those tapes again but without something controlling the way you're hearing what a prophet saying I say thou de spirit I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ take your hands off of this little faithful womanall let her hear Let Her hear the message the way God intended for her to hear it do you hear he me say amen sister repeats it amen say it again amen I love the Lord I love the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord I love this one Jesus Loves Me Jesus loves me she could hear and the evidence she could hear well she could speak the same thing that she was hearing what about you this morning why don't you bring that imagination subject to the word of God why don't you bring that feeling subject to the word of God why don't you be like Joshua today as a musicians are coming 40 years later he had entered the promised land and being the great mil military General when the first battle his enemies had walled into a place when there was no way for him to get there to get them but by faith he looked at the Unseen because God gave Moses a promise promise while they were yet in Egypt I have given you all Palestine and by faith he saw the walls of Jericho laying flat on the ground brother brother Mitch those walls are still standing there still tall enough to have chariot races on but Joshua by faith he looked at those walls but he didn't see him standing he seen him falling and laying flat on the ground and he marched around in full armor with not one doubt in his heart but believing that God would do it and when the trumpet sounded and the people shouted the walls fell and they took the city why he seen the invisible one remember before he did this he was walking one afternoon and he seen a man who was standing against the wall with his sword drawn and Joshua draw his sword and went to meet him and he said are you for us or are you for the enemy and the man spoke back and Saidi am the captain of the host of the Lord I love these next words Joshua knowed the battle belonged to him then when he met and seen the invisible one sister Carol there was a revelation dropped in his soul this battle belongs to me now I hadn't swung one sword I ain't throwed one Rock The Battle Belongs to Me and when the people here tonight that sinful in your heart I don't mean you live in adultery I don't mean you get drunk I mean sin is unbelief within your heart if you'll just open up your heart and close your eyes so he's talking about it cleaning out right open up your heart close your eyes and look at the chief Captain who's Omni present tonight the world will lay flat at your feet will shake away every Fetter of Sin from you and the doubting days will be over pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen realizing there's something going on in another world realizing it's real dreary here and realizing there's a lot of problems and situations come on folks it's lay out to see it but there's another world brother Merl by faith we're going to press into it you love him this morning won't you stand to your feet with us brother said there in that that sermon he comes back preaching from Beyond the curtain of time comes back and he said when I was there he said I Heard a Voice he said when I got back he said I Heard a Voice and he said the voice I

the battle see that de Spirit couldn't affect what he was hearing he was really hearing a voice and that voice was saying press the battle press the battle can I tell you something folks when you hear that voice ain't telling you press the battle you're not imagining something it's really speaking to you press the battle weary press the battle discouraged press the battle dealing with mind battles about things you've seen things you've heard things you've read things you've been involved in whatever press the battle that's the word of the Lord this morning press the battle it's not a voice of imagination it's a voice of Revelation he's telling you this morning press the battle I want you bow your hearts with this this morning Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for the revelation of your

know how that enemy works that enemy wants to get our imaginations running wild he wants to get us controlled by imaginations but Lord we're not here this morning being led by imagination we're led by Revelation and Lord your Prophet has spoke directly in this age and he has told us to cast down imaginations Lord he stood there and preached the greatest battle ever fault and showed how the power of the the inward senses the outward senses how they War one against the other but Lord above all those 10 senses of the outer Inner Man together there is a super sense called the Holy Spirit and there is the six sense called faith and that is the faith of God that dwells in you Lord I pray for every believer here this morning Lord maybe they've maybe they've been like I was the other day clouds and rain and darkness and dreariness and just trying to imagine that things was going to get better and imagine things was going to change Lord maybe they're in the third or fourth or fifth day or week or month of their trial and things ain't really changed Lord Lord may they keep walking may they keep pressing the battle Lord father knowing that once they get on that on that plane as it were and begin to fly Lord if it just open up the wind of shade Lord just on the other side of the clouds on the other side of the dreariness on the other side of the heaviness on the other side of the issue or the problem or the circumstance Lord the sun is still shining and Lord if they can just press through the clouds Hallelujah if they can just press through the dreariness and the riness and the coldness

had posted and he's and and brother brandom M said well how could Jesus overcome the things that he did he said because he had a predestinated heart then a couple paragraphs down and he says and how is it that Christ is going to manifest himself through his Earthly church because we are predestined to it we're ordained to see that oh my there is something within us as I must press there's something says I must receive the Holy Ghost there's something says I must go beyond form there's something that says I want that world to control me I want Christ to have preeminence in me that way
