[54:16] beginning of the creation of God
[54:18] I Know Thy works that thou art neither
[54:21] cold nor hot
[54:23] I would thou work cold or hot and so
[54:26] then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[54:29] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[54:32] out of my mouth
[54:34] and because thou sayest I am rich and
[54:37] increased with goods and have need of
[54:39] nothing
[54:40] and know us not that thou art wretched
[54:43] and miserable and poor and blind and
[54:45] naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[54:49] tried in the fire
[54:51] that thou mayest be rich and white
[54:53] arraignment uh
[54:56] that thou mayest be be clothed in the
[55:00] thighs that the shame of thy nakedness
[55:02] do not appear
[55:03] and anoint thine eyes with I sound that
[55:05] thou mayest see as many as I love I
[55:08] rebuke and chasten bezalius therefore
[55:11] and repent
[55:12] Amen brother Bradham says the Zeal of
[55:14] the age is what repentance
[55:17] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[55:19] if any man hear my voice and open the
[55:22] door I will come into him and will sup
[55:24] with him and he with me
[55:27] to him that overcomes somebody say I'm
[55:30] an overcomer
[55:31] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[55:35] even as I am overcome and I'm set down
[55:39] with my father in his throne and he that
[55:42] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[55:44] saith unto the churches I'd also like to
[55:49] go back to the 12th verse
[55:52] amen
[55:54] he that overcometh will I make a pillar
[55:57] in the temple of my God
[55:59] and he shall go no more out
[56:02] and I will write upon him the name of my
[56:05] God the name of the city of my God which
[56:07] is New Jerusalem
[56:09] which cometh down out of Heaven from my
[56:11] God and I will write upon him my new
[56:15] name and he that hath an ear let him
[56:18] hear what the spirit says unto the
[56:21] churches let's go to the Lord in prayer
[56:24] father we thank you today for the many
[56:27] blessings that you have given us
[56:29] thank you for
[56:31] your love
[56:33] that is
[56:35] unfaltering and shaking
[56:38] thank you for the amazing words of life
[56:42] that you have brought to us in this age
[56:46] Lord I'm asking that you would help us
[56:49] this morning as we
[56:51] think about a simple topic on Overcomers
[56:55] then I'm asking Lord that you would help
[56:58] me to speak I'm asking Lord that you
[57:00] would help the hearers Lift us all up
[57:02] into your anointing this morning
[57:05] now Lord I I need some strength in my
[57:09] voice
[57:10] and I know that Lord if you just help me
[57:13] to relax and enter into your anointing
[57:15] then all things will be okay
[57:17] we thank you for it Lord in the name of
[57:20] the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:22] can the Church Say Amen
[57:24] and amen God bless you you may be seated
[57:28] here this morning
[57:30] amen how many is glad you're a believer
[57:33] how many Believers are in the house here
[57:35] this morning
[57:37] Hallelujah Believers amen we're not
[57:41] Believers in some kind of a TV thing but
[57:43] we're Believers in the unadulterated
[57:46] word of God
[57:48] amen now when we think about Overcomers
[57:51] I want to speak for just a a few moments
[57:54] this morning on Overcomers there are are
[57:57] three groups in the Bible amen now
[58:00] there's and you've got to rightly divide
[58:02] the word of Truth so in the Bible there
[58:04] are three groups there is Israel
[58:06] there is the church
[58:08] and then there are the Gentiles or the
[58:10] Nations amen that's the in in the Bible
[58:13] when you're when you're dealing with uh
[58:15] when you're dealing with prophecy
[58:17] throughout the entire Bible it's dealing
[58:19] with three different
[58:20] groups of people amen there are there
[58:23] are Israel there is uh uh the church and
[58:28] there is and then there is the Gentiles
[58:31] are the Gentiles or the Nations
[58:33] now a woman a woman is is a type it's a
[58:37] a metaphoric or a symbol of the bride of
[58:41] Christ and so amen when God is wanting
[58:44] to deal with the church he always deals
[58:46] with her as a woman amen and so when he
[58:50] dealt with Israel God God uh was a was a
[58:56] husband Jehovah was a husband unto uh uh
[59:00] Israel amen the natural Israel and so we
[59:05] we he talked with her as if she was his
[59:08] bride in the New Testament Church amen
[59:12] we find that there are are three there
[59:15] are three women that are are described
[59:18] in in the New Testament there is the
[59:20] bride who is the wise virgins there is
[59:24] the church who are the foolish virgins
[59:27] amen and then there is the the and
[59:32] the harlots Satan bride or Satan Babylon
[59:35] Satan's kingdom and so there are three
[59:39] women in the New Testament amen this New
[59:42] Testament Church that all comprise
[59:45] they're all religious they they all go
[59:48] to church they all use the same Bibles
[59:51] but only the Overcomers only the bride
[59:56] will overcome the spirit of the age in
[1:00:00] the age of incredible uh
[1:00:03] adulteries and and the age of incredible
[1:00:06] uh fornications and and sex sins that
[1:00:12] are that that are in this world today
[1:00:14] amen it is also carried over into the
[1:00:18] church until God Jesus says they're in
[1:00:21] in the Book of Revelations Jesus said
[1:00:24] that this woman would be a there would
[1:00:28] be a prostitute woman she would be amen
[1:00:32] the Great and she would have
[1:00:34] daughters who would be harlots amen and
[1:00:38] so we we find this that there are the
[1:00:42] wise there are the foolish and the there
[1:00:46] are those that are a man just in in
[1:00:50] adultery now we understand that this is
[1:00:53] a spiritual it's a metaphor it's not
[1:00:56] like the the church is going to uh or or
[1:00:59] you know that that you know someone says
[1:01:02] well
[1:01:03] you know uh uh you're claiming to be the
[1:01:06] bride and you're a man amen it is it is
[1:01:09] a category or it is a metaphor that God
[1:01:12] is used for his people amen that we all
[1:01:16] comprise of the Bride of Jesus Christ in
[1:01:20] other words we are coming under his
[1:01:22] authority under his headship can you say
[1:01:26] man so so adultery brother Bradham
[1:01:29] taught us that adultery happens a long
[1:01:32] time before the physical act it was uh
[1:01:35] uh uh Eve had already fallen Eve had
[1:01:40] already sinned when she took the words
[1:01:43] of the serpent into the womb of her
[1:01:46] spirit and then did she give herself
[1:01:50] away unto that beast and committed
[1:01:53] adultery now brother Branham says this
[1:01:55] he says now she is a type talking about
[1:01:58] the woman a type of all things vulgar
[1:02:00] and foul and Lonesome on the on the one
[1:02:03] hand on the other hand she is the type
[1:02:05] of all things clean and beautiful and
[1:02:08] holy as the receptacles of the spirit
[1:02:10] and blessings of God on the one hand she
[1:02:13] is called the who is drunk with
[1:02:15] the wine of her fornications on the
[1:02:17] other hand she is called the bride of
[1:02:19] Christ on the one hand she is Mystery
[1:02:21] Babylon the Abomination before God on
[1:02:24] the other hand she is called New
[1:02:26] Jerusalem our mother on the other hand
[1:02:28] she is so foul and wicked and lewd that
[1:02:31] she is
[1:02:32] summarily cast into the Lake of Fire as
[1:02:36] only fit as the only fit place for her
[1:02:39] and on the other hand she is exalted to
[1:02:41] Heaven sharing the very Throne of God as
[1:02:44] only as the only place befitting such a
[1:02:47] queen can you say Amen now so so we can
[1:02:51] see that that that these these women
[1:02:53] amen when I again once again the the
[1:02:57] terminology used for amen it's
[1:03:00] it's natural meaning is to commit
[1:03:02] fornication or adultery it is someone
[1:03:05] that is willing to set aside their
[1:03:07] morals amen it means to be sexually
[1:03:11] indiscriminate to break the vows with
[1:03:13] her husband amen so you say how can this
[1:03:17] apply to the church how can this dirty
[1:03:22] filthy woman this prostitute amen even
[1:03:26] be in the same category of as the church
[1:03:30] but we find out that it is very true
[1:03:33] it's a woman that is not living true to
[1:03:37] her husband and his word amen so this
[1:03:40] this is something that uh in other words
[1:03:43] there's going to be a spirit in this age
[1:03:46] that is going to be there to lure God's
[1:03:51] people out and away from God's word amen
[1:03:55] and so I I want us to look at that this
[1:03:57] morning for a few moments there are
[1:03:59] spirits out there to lure you away
[1:04:05] from the oath that you gave unto the
[1:04:09] Lord Jesus Christ amen now now once
[1:04:12] again brother Bradham would say amen
[1:04:14] that's how adultery is committed
[1:04:16] spiritually when you knowing better by
[1:04:19] the word of God by the Intercourse of
[1:04:22] the Mind take in uh take in a lie of the
[1:04:27] devil against the word of God that's
[1:04:29] exactly what Eva done now I want us to
[1:04:32] think about that when we take anything
[1:04:36] contrary to our husband God the Lord
[1:04:40] Jesus Christ we take anything contrary
[1:04:44] to his word into our spirit we are in
[1:04:47] effect committing adultery against God
[1:04:51] now I want you to really think about
[1:04:53] that here this morning amen because just
[1:04:55] because you're sitting in a in a message
[1:04:57] church but yet you're petting spirits
[1:05:00] that God does not condone you you you
[1:05:03] you allow things in your mind take uh
[1:05:06] attitudes or Spirits or anything into
[1:05:09] your mind and into your heart you are
[1:05:12] effectively Hallelujah now now you might
[1:05:16] be all Pious and looking at somebody
[1:05:17] else and saying oh oh I know there's
[1:05:20] something there amen but what about your
[1:05:24] very your soul and keeping that Soul
[1:05:27] true to the one that you say is your
[1:05:31] lord
[1:05:33] amen now I I think this is this is
[1:05:37] something that we should amen keep in
[1:05:39] our our hearts as we go this morning
[1:05:41] because the elect of the age only the
[1:05:45] elect is going to overcome the spirits
[1:05:48] of this age now I've got some news for
[1:05:50] you here this morning amen because
[1:05:52] brother Branham says the only way that
[1:05:54] he could even uh have a believer in this
[1:05:57] age is to predestinate it so the only
[1:06:00] way that there's going to be an
[1:06:01] overcomer in this age the only way we
[1:06:04] would ever have a chance in this age is
[1:06:08] God predestinated a group of people to
[1:06:11] overcome in this age well that should
[1:06:13] make you want to shout right now amen he
[1:06:16] says it's by his Believers that he
[1:06:18] proves his word by he says he can only
[1:06:20] prove his word not by the unbelievers
[1:06:22] it's only by the Believers that he can
[1:06:24] prove his word no matter how much the
[1:06:26] rest of them claim to be oh I believe
[1:06:29] brother see if you do God will prove it
[1:06:33] so oh cause we look and we see the
[1:06:36] others how can we say then see it's it's
[1:06:38] by the True Believers that God proves
[1:06:41] his word not by those who say they
[1:06:44] believe but those who really believe
[1:06:47] it's by his believing children that he
[1:06:51] proves his word so when we stand upon
[1:06:53] that word hallelujah I'm going to
[1:06:56] believe God I believe a Christian is
[1:06:59] going to line everything in their belief
[1:07:01] system up with this word do you know
[1:07:04] that's the reason why amen that God put
[1:07:07] a but put the man is the head of the
[1:07:09] house is because the scripture says that
[1:07:11] the woman is the weaker vessel and and
[1:07:14] that the woman can imagine she can run
[1:07:16] by her emotions and she can think that
[1:07:19] she knows exactly what is going on when
[1:07:21] she doesn't at all amen and she can she
[1:07:24] can she can be led astray and you are to
[1:07:28] have your husband there to be your
[1:07:31] leader and to your god what can I you're
[1:07:33] an amen sisters amen we've got our
[1:07:36] husbands there to be our I know where
[1:07:39] that's this this
[1:07:40] this this don't go over too well in this
[1:07:43] generation but we have a head in the
[1:07:47] home and it's not the woman's
[1:07:49] spirituality it's not the woman's amen
[1:07:52] into an issue it's not the woman's
[1:07:55] thoughts and and her attitudes and amen
[1:07:58] there's only one head in the home and
[1:08:01] that is your husband
[1:08:04] now as the Bride of Jesus Christ then we
[1:08:09] come under the headship of Jesus Christ
[1:08:14] that puts me right in the same category
[1:08:16] amen I'm a bride member brother Donald
[1:08:18] you're a bride member amen Lanae you're
[1:08:21] a bride we are all a part of that and
[1:08:25] our headship is Jesus Christ
[1:08:28] the word
[1:08:35] how spiritual you are it's not how well
[1:08:39] you think it should be it's the way God
[1:08:42] says it would be
[1:08:45] Hallelujah now amen now don't y'all
[1:08:48] don't don't quit smiling at me now amen
[1:08:51] some of you sisters have already lost
[1:08:53] the victory this morning hallelujah amen
[1:08:56] you might get Bob with telling your
[1:08:58] husband how to eat the cabbage at home
[1:09:00] but you ain't gonna get by with her from
[1:09:02] God
[1:09:06] and I'll just bring you another one if
[1:09:07] you're going to be over there you had
[1:09:10] better overcome in your position here
[1:09:14] so if you're what you do to your husband
[1:09:17] here is what God's looking as being done
[1:09:20] to him there he gave the headship of the
[1:09:24] word to you here so if you're under the
[1:09:28] headship of the word you're going to
[1:09:30] submit to your husband
[1:09:33] well praise the Lord
[1:09:35] and you're not going to go around
[1:09:36] causing trouble and lie amen you're
[1:09:38] gonna you're gonna line it up with the
[1:09:40] word of God husbands I think it's time
[1:09:43] to line our our houses up to the word of
[1:09:46] God I think we ought to be Overcomers in
[1:09:49] this generation man we've got to be
[1:09:51] spiritual we've got to take these things
[1:09:53] into effect and say all right my home is
[1:09:57] not a guess-up or a gossip session amen
[1:10:00] it's not a it's not a trash dump where
[1:10:02] all of the gossip goes on if I don't
[1:10:05] know what I'm talking about I'm going to
[1:10:06] shut up and honey you are too
[1:10:11] Standing Ovation please
[1:10:16] honey I need me a sign I need me a sign
[1:10:19] up there when to clap Hallelujah you see
[1:10:21] now God is expecting the same from his
[1:10:28] pride
[1:10:30] God's got a cause for you to be here on
[1:10:34] this Earth and that's to destroy the
[1:10:37] enemy now what brings in
[1:10:40] brings in the uh uh uh uh you know the
[1:10:44] the the the malice or the you know the
[1:10:47] the discontentment between husband and
[1:10:49] wife and what brings in what causes what
[1:10:54] causes a woman a man to belittle or to
[1:10:57] minimize her husband's words you see I I
[1:11:02] say that it is a spirit there are
[1:11:05] spirits on the earth to try to come in
[1:11:09] and dismantle a man at the nuclear
[1:11:11] family trying to dismantle the headship
[1:11:15] because if you can remove the headship
[1:11:18] then you will remove amen the power that
[1:11:22] is to flow through that family so there
[1:11:25] are demons at play these demons are
[1:11:28] there to try to get you ladies to look
[1:11:32] somewhere else
[1:11:33] instead of to your husband
[1:11:37] well glory to God
[1:11:39] I I I want to tell you right now amen
[1:11:42] your husband is the head over you not
[1:11:44] your pastor
[1:11:48] Pastor is not the head of the family
[1:11:50] your husband is the head of the family
[1:11:53] can you say Amen there's nowhere in
[1:11:56] there in there that says you're high or
[1:11:59] your pastor is to override your husband
[1:12:01] your husband is the he is the man the
[1:12:06] buck stops right there it is
[1:12:11] Hallelujah you say well what are you
[1:12:13] doing Amen brother Wendell I am here to
[1:12:16] Simply help punch you to the right
[1:12:19] direction teach you men how to lead
[1:12:21] teach you ladies how to follow and then
[1:12:24] lead your children we are here with a
[1:12:27] purpose and that is to defeat the enemy
[1:12:31] [Applause]
[1:12:33] well praise the lord we have glory to
[1:12:35] God Amen now now now Satan came in and
[1:12:40] tried to tell Eve she was wiser than
[1:12:42] Adam
[1:12:44] Hallelujah
[1:12:45] now when Satan came in Amen brother
[1:12:48] Branham says he got her away that means
[1:12:52] this didn't just happen this didn't just
[1:12:54] happen overnight but Satan was was was
[1:12:57] was was pulling on her getting her away
[1:13:00] from her husband and then he dropped
[1:13:04] amen the bomb and then all of a sudden
[1:13:07] we find ourselves six thousand years
[1:13:11] later in these Fallen decayed bodies all
[1:13:16] because a woman felt she knew better
[1:13:20] than her husband
[1:13:22] this ain't on my notes but Hallelujah
[1:13:24] here we are
[1:13:25] amen she thought she knew better than
[1:13:30] her husband can you say Amen
[1:13:32] and now here he's fine we find ourselves
[1:13:36] a man in this broken condition now here
[1:13:40] she was put there she was put in a city
[1:13:43] where she was put in the walls of God's
[1:13:46] word now yes the Garden of Eden was
[1:13:50] beautiful and it was perfect and it was
[1:13:52] Serene and it was everything but there
[1:13:54] was nothing there was no walls around
[1:13:57] that uh around that Garden there was
[1:14:01] there was nothing there amen that could
[1:14:04] that would keep the devil out God simply
[1:14:08] gave him
[1:14:10] gave them his word
[1:14:13] his word was stronger than any gate
[1:14:18] his word was stronger than any wall his
[1:14:22] word was Stronger Hallelujah he gave
[1:14:26] them his word
[1:14:29] and as long as they stayed behind the
[1:14:33] word
[1:14:36] they were Overcomers
[1:14:38] as long as they stayed behind the word
[1:14:43] the Devil Himself
[1:14:46] had no control over their lives
[1:14:49] Hallelujah that devil might have been in
[1:14:52] that Garden for several days he might
[1:14:54] have been scheming for several days but
[1:14:55] as long as she was behind that work as
[1:14:58] long as she was standing there with the
[1:14:59] well come on church and I want to tell
[1:15:01] you it doesn't matter what the devil
[1:15:03] says he can yak his Jaws all he wants to
[1:15:05] but as long as you're standing behind
[1:15:07] the word of God you are safe you are
[1:15:10] secure amen the presence of God is with
[1:15:13] you the word of God is flowing through
[1:15:15] you you are under his headship and Satan
[1:15:19] has to answer to him
[1:15:22] he'll praise the Lord
[1:15:24] amen now so we find that the word of God
[1:15:28] a man was overlooked
[1:15:31] so brother Branham taught us that the
[1:15:33] adultery took place
[1:15:36] a long time before the physical act took
[1:15:40] place
[1:15:41] because there was a man there was a a
[1:15:45] lowering of the word there was a lower
[1:15:48] there was a coming out from behind the
[1:15:50] protection and listening to the spirits
[1:15:53] that she had no business listening to
[1:15:57] oh I could preach right now amen what
[1:16:00] what what
[1:16:01] business do we have
[1:16:03] walking out the side outside of that
[1:16:06] word and listening to things that we
[1:16:08] don't have a business listening to
[1:16:09] entertaining thoughts that we don't have
[1:16:11] a business center to what can you say
[1:16:13] Amen you see we the reason why we're
[1:16:16] loose lips is because our Spirits are
[1:16:18] already there
[1:16:20] our Spirits are already outside the word
[1:16:24] and you can't train those lips to talk
[1:16:28] right when your spirit is already there
[1:16:31] and it's feeding on the junk of the
[1:16:35] devil
[1:16:37] feeding on the junk of the devil you
[1:16:39] can't help but amen live a life that
[1:16:42] that where that comes about but if you
[1:16:44] stand behind the word of God there is
[1:16:48] where the Overcomer is there is where
[1:16:50] you bring every thought in line with the
[1:16:53] word of God well praise the Lord here's
[1:16:56] where when the enemy is hitting you
[1:16:57] every which direction and pulling this
[1:17:00] way and pulling that way you're standing
[1:17:02] there upon thus saithful Lord you're not
[1:17:05] going to commit adultery against against
[1:17:07] the word against what Christ has given
[1:17:09] you you're going to keep your mind your
[1:17:11] thoughts your words your actions
[1:17:13] everything upon thus saith the Lord and
[1:17:16] you have been ordained of God
[1:17:20] to do so
[1:17:23] now he says
[1:17:25] it's only by True Believers
[1:17:28] that he proves his word
[1:17:31] of those who say they believe
[1:17:34] well you can play music in the church
[1:17:36] and be the biggest hypocrite there is
[1:17:39] you can be a preacher in the church and
[1:17:42] be the biggest devil there is
[1:17:44] but it's those who line their thoughts
[1:17:51] prayer Glory to God
[1:17:54] the Bible says gird up
[1:17:57] the loins
[1:17:58] of your mind
[1:18:01] why what what loins loins isn't that the
[1:18:04] reproductive part of a man what what is
[1:18:06] what is mind and loins there's where you
[1:18:09] have your babies
[1:18:13] right here
[1:18:15] there's where the Devil comes in and
[1:18:19] starts planting his seeds
[1:18:21] right here
[1:18:23] there's where the enemy comes in and
[1:18:26] before you know it you're looking at
[1:18:27] that sister saying
[1:18:29] uh yeah
[1:18:31] I've seen the way she she acted and
[1:18:35] before you know it Satan's got this big
[1:18:37] old thing Hallelujah it ain't a bit true
[1:18:40] but you believe it
[1:18:42] and you're getting everyone else to
[1:18:44] believe it because you are outside the
[1:18:48] protection of that word
[1:18:53] well glory to God before you know what
[1:18:56] you've got all you're all laid up you're
[1:18:58] all laid up you're ate up from the amen
[1:19:01] the top of your head to the bottom of
[1:19:02] your feet yet you're still coming to
[1:19:04] church amen with your hands lifted up as
[1:19:07] you know you ain't got Victory you know
[1:19:09] the enemy's coming against you but God
[1:19:11] is saying there's going to be somebody
[1:19:14] who's going to fight against those
[1:19:18] devils and overcome
[1:19:23] Hallelujah
[1:19:25] man
[1:19:26] there ain't nothing
[1:19:29] there ain't nothing like a
[1:19:34] like a cat
[1:19:36] I'm letting that cat out and before you
[1:19:38] know every time you don't you think you
[1:19:40] I you just you just think that and that
[1:19:42] cat has comes back and she's pregnant
[1:19:44] and she's got babies and amen you've
[1:19:47] still got that litter and before you
[1:19:48] know it she's pregnant again and you
[1:19:50] ain't got rid of those kittens yet and
[1:19:52] amen and you're starting to starting to
[1:19:54] love the cats and and and you know who
[1:19:57] cares that your house stinks and
[1:19:58] everything else stinks you know when
[1:20:01] they're they're they're they're they're
[1:20:02] peeing all over everything spraying
[1:20:04] everything and scratching your car all
[1:20:06] up amen before you know it they've got
[1:20:08] another one another litter coming and
[1:20:10] another litter coming and can you say
[1:20:13] Amen
[1:20:14] brother Wendell I just don't know how I
[1:20:17] got this way I just don't know how I
[1:20:19] just don't know where this came from I
[1:20:21] know you left the cap out of the house
[1:20:29] well praise the Lord
[1:20:31] I'd say we need to take the cat down and
[1:20:33] Spade them or whatever that thing's
[1:20:35] called
[1:20:36] amen get that thing get that thing all
[1:20:38] taken well Hallelujah
[1:20:41] I'm so
[1:20:45] it's something that is done on purpose
[1:20:49] it's not something that's going to
[1:20:50] happen by accident there is something on
[1:20:53] the genetics on the inside of a daughter
[1:20:57] and a son of God that is going to
[1:21:01] overcome the muck of this world
[1:21:06] Hallelujah well come on now amen now now
[1:21:10] some of you are still hung up on the
[1:21:11] cats amen I've had cats Hallelujah

[1:21:16] that's not that's not true amen I've had
[1:21:18] cats we've you know I've you love cats
[1:21:21] that's wonderful amen but cats are some
[1:21:23] of the most dumbest animals you can't
[1:21:25] ever train them to do anything and I
[1:21:27] want to tell you that's what the enemy
[1:21:29] wants to do to you he wants to get you
[1:21:32] out there let that mind go out there and
[1:21:35] just roam everywhere and you come back
[1:21:37] and impregnated with thoughts of the
[1:21:40] enemy
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:48] that the enemy wants to come in he wants
[1:21:51] to try and then he brings those babies
[1:21:53] back home and all their cooking cute and
[1:21:56] cuddly hey man but I'm here to tell you
[1:21:59] God's got something more for you than
[1:22:03] just amen let your thoughts go wild and
[1:22:06] come to church occasionally God has
[1:22:08] ordained you to rise and to overcome
[1:22:13] your enemies
[1:22:19] Hallelujah
[1:22:20] amen somebody's going to have to do it
[1:22:23] now
[1:22:24] now brother Brandon was I'm fixing to
[1:22:26] tell to read the rest of this story on
[1:22:27] these Believers now he says the old crop
[1:22:30] had to die off
[1:22:32] because every time they turn around God
[1:22:34] done some things spectacular God God God
[1:22:37] heal him God God gave him water at the
[1:22:40] Red Sea God damn I mean God done all of
[1:22:42] these things
[1:22:44] and yep
[1:22:47] the enemy kept coming in and breeding
[1:22:49] junk in their hearts and their minds
[1:22:52] and brother Branham says
[1:22:54] now he has to have Believers the old
[1:22:55] crop has died off
[1:22:57] them believers who said we can't take it
[1:23:00] he let every one of them perish
[1:23:02] every one of them but to the Believers
[1:23:05] who was left
[1:23:06] Moses had been taken to Glory the
[1:23:10] unbelievers had perished in the
[1:23:11] wilderness and now was their children
[1:23:14] there were only two that crossed over
[1:23:17] and that was the Believers Joshua and
[1:23:20] Caleb they was the Believers they was
[1:23:22] the ones who crossed over it's only the
[1:23:25] way it's the only way God can do it is
[1:23:27] by his believing children you believe
[1:23:29] that
[1:23:30] all right his Believers were the ones
[1:23:33] that done it he used them to cross over
[1:23:35] with
[1:23:36] now I want you to notice
[1:23:38] he does it that way in every age he does
[1:23:41] it every time by the same method he has
[1:23:43] to take Believers and then in order to
[1:23:45] have Believers to meet that word he's
[1:23:47] got to predestinate it to that age do
[1:23:50] you see it he's got to predestinate this
[1:23:53] thing to be here to meet the challenge
[1:23:56] of the age he says did you get it did
[1:23:59] you feel it did you see it do you
[1:24:01] understand it now he's really want you
[1:24:03] to understand this now that's what is
[1:24:05] happening today he's predestinated it to
[1:24:09] this by his poor knowledge when he
[1:24:12] predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to
[1:24:15] happen when he come over and
[1:24:16] predestinated anything to happen in his
[1:24:18] word he has to prove it to me so and
[1:24:22] when he predestinates anything to happen
[1:24:23] and says it'll happen he knows that seed
[1:24:26] will be there just at that time he's
[1:24:29] predestinated a bride someone say
[1:24:31] hallelujah
[1:24:32] she's going to be there
[1:24:36] going to be a Rapture she's going to be
[1:24:39] there he predestininated by his
[1:24:41] foreknowledge there's nothing going to
[1:24:44] stop it
[1:24:47] you say
[1:24:49] well then why are you breaking
[1:24:51] if we're predestinated
[1:24:54] if we're predestinated and nothing's
[1:24:58] going to stop it
[1:25:00] why are we here
[1:25:04] okay
[1:25:06] you see God's not going to do your
[1:25:08] overcoming for you
[1:25:11] you're still mortal
[1:25:12] you're still human and you've still got
[1:25:15] a mind that Satan loves to try to get to
[1:25:20] hell I'm preaching better than your amen
[1:25:22] and right now
[1:25:24] Hallelujah you are still a human being
[1:25:28] and Satan knows how to play the system
[1:25:37] but on the inside of you
[1:25:41] Hallelujah
[1:25:44] I used to tell the boys
[1:25:48] and I it was just something that I
[1:25:50] always thought that I told
[1:25:52] the boys when they were growing up
[1:25:55] I said you're either going to be in a
[1:25:57] factory the rest of your life
[1:26:00] you're you're either going you're going
[1:26:01] you're going to have to answer to
[1:26:04] somebody the rest of your life now this
[1:26:05] might not be good advice brother Merle
[1:26:07] would probably say bad bad bad advice
[1:26:10] amen
[1:26:12] because he now because now he's he's
[1:26:14] he's he's just retired he's got all
[1:26:16] those big bucks still coming in amen
[1:26:19] well brother brother brother
[1:26:21] I I I I I I said you but God
[1:26:25] and there's got to be
[1:26:27] there's got to be the givers and the
[1:26:29] takers there's got to be those that are
[1:26:31] punching the time clock there's got to
[1:26:34] be but God has ordained you to rule
[1:26:38] I told him there's nothing wrong with
[1:26:40] working at McDonald's there's nothing
[1:26:41] wrong with working over there but I'm
[1:26:42] here to tell you amen I'm looking at
[1:26:45] some contractors in the future
[1:26:48] I'm looking at some people that can that
[1:26:50] can feed other people
[1:26:51] I'm looking I I I say I say you can own
[1:26:54] your own business you can do your own
[1:26:57] well praise the Lord now my
[1:27:01] day was there
[1:27:05] was that amen my wife says yeah what how
[1:27:07] what good did that do you we're broke
[1:27:09] amen hallelujah
[1:27:13] but my mentality was this God has
[1:27:16] created you
[1:27:19] God has given you that ability within
[1:27:23] that Soul To Rule and to reign
[1:27:25] and if you can ever get that connected
[1:27:27] together amen God will give that wisdom
[1:27:30] God will rise above and I'm just wanting
[1:27:32] to you put that in this in in this terms
[1:27:35] here this morning there is going to be
[1:27:37] the church as a whole amen that's just
[1:27:41] going through the round of the meal amen
[1:27:44] but there's going to be some Overcomers
[1:27:49] that's going to stand out and say listen
[1:27:52] I am ordained I am equipped I have been
[1:27:58] placed here with a specific purpose
[1:28:02] in mind
[1:28:04] no it don't always work out in the
[1:28:07] natural
[1:28:09] but in the spiritual
[1:28:11] God's calling
[1:28:13] for men
[1:28:14] and women
[1:28:16] to rise to the occasion
[1:28:19] and defeat the enemy
[1:28:24] in this natural world you say well there
[1:28:26] can only be just a few contractors there
[1:28:28] can only be just a few you know doctors
[1:28:31] there can only be just a few and you
[1:28:33] might look at yourself and say man I'm
[1:28:34] on the low end of the totem po here but
[1:28:36] in the spiritual realm every one of us
[1:28:41] have been placed on this Earth To Rule
[1:28:46] and have dominion
[1:28:48] tired
[1:28:52] amen
[1:28:54] so I'm not satisfied coming in
[1:28:57] amen I'm putting my little time clock in
[1:29:00] in church and say I'm doing what I need
[1:29:03] to do for right now and amen and I'm
[1:29:06] just putting in my duty I got to
[1:29:08] thinking this morning on the way to
[1:29:10] church it was just it was just the
[1:29:11] silliest thought as I'm as I'm driving
[1:29:13] down the road and I'm fine why what what
[1:29:16] why do people come to church in the
[1:29:18] first place
[1:29:20] you know what do people come every
[1:29:22] Sunday morning and Sunday night and
[1:29:23] every Wednesday night I mean
[1:29:25] really
[1:29:27] why
[1:29:30] because I was looking what it was I
[1:29:31] drove down the road you're saying boy
[1:29:34] get back on your notes amen I was I was
[1:29:36] going down the road and I passed all of
[1:29:37] I passed Church alley and I'm seeing
[1:29:40] these these guys get out of the church
[1:29:42] you know and
[1:29:43] and and out of the cars and and you know
[1:29:46] and then when they're getting out I mean
[1:29:47] they're
[1:29:48] they're
[1:29:50] they're coming in their you know blue
[1:29:52] jean shorts and ball caps and they're
[1:29:53] all they're all walking in and I'm and
[1:29:55] I'm looking at this as I'm driving by
[1:29:57] and I'm thinking why why do why do
[1:30:00] people come to church
[1:30:02] and I and and and and and as I'm going
[1:30:05] down and I see this church and I see the
[1:30:06] other church and I and and I'm looking
[1:30:09] and I and and and and and and of course
[1:30:11] I know that I'm preaching on overcoming
[1:30:13] here today
[1:30:14] and I got to thinking God
[1:30:18] don't let me be the run of the meal
[1:30:22] don't let me well I don't know what's
[1:30:24] bringing those guys to the church in
[1:30:26] fact when I looked up the study uh here
[1:30:28] a couple months ago we found out that
[1:30:31] that they're trying to figure out how to
[1:30:32] get the people back in the church
[1:30:34] because they can't keep them in the
[1:30:36] church amen and it's and it's become a a
[1:30:39] a a a a a a big a big deal that the
[1:30:41] denominations are talking about right
[1:30:43] now amen with all the online church
[1:30:46] services and things and I got to think
[1:30:48] God why am I going to church
[1:30:52] why am I walking in the why I'm asking
[1:30:55] myself as I'm driving on the road why am
[1:31:00] I doing it because
[1:31:01] that's my job
[1:31:04] am I doing it because people are
[1:31:06] depending on me
[1:31:10] am I coming to church this morning
[1:31:15] because
[1:31:18] amen it's something that probably should
[1:31:20] be done
[1:31:22] you heard the the story
[1:31:24] a man of the of the woman that comes
[1:31:26] into her husband
[1:31:28] Sunday morning says you need to you need
[1:31:30] to get up it's about time to get ready
[1:31:32] I'm gonna I'm gonna feed you breakfast
[1:31:34] and go to church and she comes back in
[1:31:37] and he's not he he's he's not right you
[1:31:40] know rousing around and finally after
[1:31:42] the third or fourth time amen the man
[1:31:45] looks at that woman and says give me one
[1:31:48] good reason
[1:31:49] why I need to be going to church this
[1:31:52] morning she says I'll give you two
[1:31:54] your children are out there and you need
[1:31:57] to be a good example
[1:32:00] but number one
[1:32:04] is you're the pastor
[1:32:08] and you need to be at church this
[1:32:10] morning praise the Lord now God doesn't
[1:32:13] want just average people
[1:32:20] God is looking for Overcomers
[1:32:28] and the seed has already been placed
[1:32:31] right here the genetics are already in
[1:32:34] your heart
[1:32:36] and when you try to be just the average
[1:32:39] Sam
[1:32:40] amen you find out that that that you
[1:32:44] just can't be the average guy
[1:32:46] why because the seed of eternal life is
[1:32:52] on the inside of you
[1:32:56] those are doing their thing they're
[1:32:58] doing their part they're making their
[1:33:01] preachers happy or their wives happy or
[1:33:04] their children
[1:33:06] but you
[1:33:08] have something that has already been
[1:33:10] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:33:12] the world
[1:33:13] you are just like the eagle
[1:33:16] in the chicken pen
[1:33:18] chickens are content with collecting in
[1:33:21] a bin egos never are satisfied being
[1:33:25] EarthBound
[1:33:27] therefore something's on the inside of
[1:33:31] you saying I must get out of this prison
[1:33:34] house I must get out of this chicken
[1:33:37] yard I'm not there must be something
[1:33:40] more you have been predestinated
[1:33:44] to this age
[1:33:46] oh man that should make us all want to
[1:33:49] shout
[1:33:52] you're not a chicken
[1:33:55] Hallelujah you're an eagle
[1:33:57] Hallelujah
[1:33:59] amen
[1:34:01] amen
[1:34:02] and Eagles
[1:34:04] I know there might be some chicken
[1:34:05] lovers in here and I sure thank the Lord
[1:34:07] for the salvadones they keep us in stock
[1:34:10] with
[1:34:11] chicken eggs we sure love them
[1:34:14] but Eagles
[1:34:16] eat chickens
[1:34:18] Hallelujah now you you just you just you
[1:34:21] just take that up with God hallelujah
[1:34:23] amen eagles eat chickens that's that's
[1:34:26] what Eagles do so chickens they might
[1:34:29] they might they might have their nice
[1:34:31] pretty little red rooster uh you know uh
[1:34:34] whatever and and the beard and they're
[1:34:37] crawling around but you see he's just a
[1:34:39] chicken but there is an eagle that has
[1:34:43] been rise lifted up above it to overcome
[1:34:48] the society now this morning as I as as
[1:34:52] we look at the word of God I think we
[1:34:55] should all look into in our heart if
[1:34:57] you're not an overcomer by heart then
[1:34:59] you'll never be an overcomer but if
[1:35:00] there is something on the inside of you
[1:35:02] that is an overcomer at heart I want to
[1:35:06] tell you God's given you everything to
[1:35:09] overcome by and I don't care what the
[1:35:11] enemy is doing I don't care how much you
[1:35:14] feel like you're a loser right now if
[1:35:16] there's something in
[1:35:21] God's equipped you to overcome in this
[1:35:23] age can you save my
[1:35:26] if there's something in that heart Oh
[1:35:29] Glory to God I'm going to resist the
[1:35:31] Temptations of the enemy I'm going to
[1:35:33] resist all amen of the of everything
[1:35:36] that Satan tries to pull in against me
[1:35:38] now brother Branham he would say now now
[1:35:41] what are we to overcome he says that is
[1:35:44] the normal question to ask here
[1:35:48] but this is not
[1:35:50] the thought of this verse
[1:35:52] the man where he's talking about to
[1:35:54] overcome he that overcometh will I grant
[1:35:57] to sit with me in my throne even as I am
[1:35:58] overcome
[1:35:59] and set my father's throne
[1:36:02] he says for it is not so much what we
[1:36:06] are to overcome
[1:36:09] but how
[1:36:10] we are to overcome
[1:36:15] well if I had something easier to
[1:36:16] overcome then I could overcome it
[1:36:18] doesn't matter what there is to overcome
[1:36:23] you've overcome
[1:36:26] don't be looking at the guy across the
[1:36:28] aisle and say ah
[1:36:30] he's got a lot to overcome
[1:36:33] and you can look at their wife next to
[1:36:35] you and say huh she's got a lot to
[1:36:38] overcome
[1:36:39] it's easy for us to say oh man I can see
[1:36:42] what your problem is
[1:36:43] all right will you
[1:36:45] but to look in the heart and say Lord
[1:36:48] I've got some overcoming that I need to
[1:36:50] do
[1:36:54] come on now
[1:36:57] I'm going to tell you I'll tell you I'll
[1:36:59] tell you I'll tell you no no that does
[1:37:00] not take a gift of discernment they know
[1:37:03] they need to overcome but do you know
[1:37:06] that you need to overcome
[1:37:11] well Glory it's bad when you got Eagles
[1:37:13] in the chicken pen
[1:37:14] claiming that they're chickens that
[1:37:16] they're just fine
[1:37:18] it's bad when you got Eagles in the
[1:37:20] chicken pen acting like chickens content
[1:37:23] to be chickens
[1:37:25] just because they're bigger than all the
[1:37:27] other chickens and they're less looking
[1:37:28] around and saying I am the king of this
[1:37:31] barnyard
[1:37:32] that is not your purpose buddy
[1:37:36] you're an eagle
[1:37:38] you're not to compare yourself with
[1:37:40] chickens
[1:37:41] you're gonna rise above it
[1:37:44] come on Church
[1:37:45] rise above it so today is the question
[1:37:49] is not going to hold you long but the
[1:37:51] question is not how or or or or or or
[1:37:55] what I have to overcome but how I am to
[1:38:00] overcome
[1:38:01] he says now that is the lot that now
[1:38:03] this is logical
[1:38:04] for it does matter
[1:38:06] much what we uh what what we overcome
[1:38:10] but now this is logical for it does
[1:38:13] matter much what we are to overcome as
[1:38:16] long as we know how we can overcome
[1:38:20] a quick look at the scriptures he says
[1:38:22] which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming
[1:38:25] will bring out the truth of this
[1:38:27] proposition
[1:38:28] Matthew 4 when Jesus is tempted of the
[1:38:31] devil he overcome the personal
[1:38:34] Temptations of Satan by the word
[1:38:38] by the word only
[1:38:40] in each of the major three major trials
[1:38:43] that corresponded exactly to the
[1:38:46] Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the
[1:38:48] lust of the flesh the lust of the eye
[1:38:51] and the pride of life
[1:38:53] Jesus overcame by the word eve fail to
[1:38:59] the personal Temptation Of Satan
[1:39:02] by failing to use the word
[1:39:05] Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the
[1:39:07] word but Jesus overcame by the word
[1:39:13] and right now let me say that this is
[1:39:17] the only way to be an overcomer also it
[1:39:20] is the only way that you can know if you
[1:39:23] are overcoming
[1:39:25] because that word can't fail
[1:39:28] now notice again how Jesus overcame the
[1:39:31] World Systems of religion when he
[1:39:34] repeatedly when he was repeatedly
[1:39:36] badgered by the theologians of his day
[1:39:38] he constantly applied the word he spake
[1:39:41] only what the father gave him to speak
[1:39:42] there was not a time when the world when
[1:39:46] the world was not utterly confused by
[1:39:48] his wisdom
[1:39:49] for it was the wisdom of God in his own
[1:39:52] personal life contending with himself he
[1:39:54] overcome by The Obedience of the word
[1:39:57] Hebrews 5 and 7 says who in the days of
[1:40:00] his flesh when he had offered up prayers
[1:40:03] and supplication and strong crying and
[1:40:06] tears talking about Jesus unto him that
[1:40:09] was able to save him from death
[1:40:12] and was hurting that he feared and
[1:40:14] though he were a son yet learned he
[1:40:18] obedience by the things
[1:40:21] which he suffered
[1:40:23] and being made perfect someone shout
[1:40:27] hallelujah
[1:40:28] he become the author of Eternal
[1:40:31] salvation unto all them
[1:40:34] that obey him
[1:40:36] what was he obedient to
[1:40:38] the word of God now then there will not
[1:40:42] be one person
[1:40:44] who will set in the Throne of the Lord
[1:40:47] Jesus Christ
[1:40:48] unless he has been living in that living
[1:40:51] that word
[1:40:52] your prayers your fastings your
[1:40:55] repentances no matter what you present
[1:40:58] to God none of that will gain you the
[1:41:00] privilege of sitting in that throne
[1:41:04] it will be granted only to the word
[1:41:08] bride
[1:41:11] we've just got our separations there's
[1:41:13] three women in the church
[1:41:15] there is the
[1:41:16] wise virgin
[1:41:18] foolish virgin
[1:41:20] and then the Great Horror and the
[1:41:21] harlots
[1:41:23] there's only one who is going to be
[1:41:25] sitting in that throne
[1:41:28] this is what separates the women from
[1:41:31] the girls the men from the boys
[1:41:34] this is what separates is God's word
[1:41:39] taken to your heart number one and you
[1:41:42] lining up your thoughts your Ambitions
[1:41:46] your desires everything about you
[1:41:51] with that word
[1:41:57] he's our husband
[1:42:00] he's our Lord
[1:42:03] it's not what I think
[1:42:05] he's the one that invites me
[1:42:07] to his throne
[1:42:09] that he overcome and is seated in now I
[1:42:14] am overcoming
[1:42:15] and I'm going to set with him
[1:42:19] in the throne that he overcome with can
[1:42:22] you say Amen ah y'all ain't listening to
[1:42:25] me
[1:42:25] it will only be granted to the word
[1:42:28] bride and as the Throne of the king is
[1:42:32] shared with the queen because she is
[1:42:34] United to him so only they who are of
[1:42:38] that word even as he is of that word
[1:42:42] will share
[1:42:44] that through
[1:42:46] you know what that does for me
[1:42:49] that that tells me there I I I it it
[1:42:52] makes me want to it makes me wanna uh
[1:42:54] quote that scripture there in in Hebrews
[1:42:57] 12 and 1. amen we're just talking about
[1:43:00] the great cloud of witnesses the
[1:43:02] Overcomers of all of the other ages who
[1:43:05] are already there waiting
[1:43:07] amen he says I'm being compassionate
[1:43:09] about was so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:43:12] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:43:16] sin that would so easily beset us and
[1:43:19] let us run with patience the race
[1:43:24] that is set before us
[1:43:30] you know what makes a winner
[1:43:37] a champion is born a champion
[1:43:41] is born a winner
[1:43:47] he couldn't win anything he couldn't be
[1:43:50] a champion over anything he couldn't do
[1:43:51] anything
[1:43:52] until he was trained
[1:43:55] but what makes a champion a champion is

[1:53:16] over talking to some guys
[1:53:17] and some other guys I seen a little
[1:53:20] gleam in one of their eyes and they were
[1:53:22] they was like

[1:53:29] this
[1:53:30] that that that uh we didn't know

[1:54:00] my instructors they were they were proud
[1:54:04] you know why
[1:54:06] because the guys who took fourth third
[1:54:09] and second

[1:54:14] and I could see Mr Lake said well at
[1:54:16] least we got three
[1:54:17] but then number one
[1:54:20] Wendell Martin
[1:54:24] I'm going
[1:54:32] you would think that number four number
[1:54:36] three number two would be all happy for
[1:54:39] number one they were not
[1:54:43] they weren't happy when I was on the
[1:54:45] stage and they weren't happy when we we
[1:54:48] rode together and they were so mad all
[1:54:51] were they mad and I'd use that time as
[1:54:56] my Victory lap
[1:54:58] I knew I could do it I told you I could
[1:55:00] do it I come on
[1:55:03] I had to offer
[1:55:06] I had to fight harder than everyone else
[1:55:09] but I did it
[1:55:18] I came back the second year it was a
[1:55:21] little bit different story
[1:55:24] now everyone was saying
[1:55:26] we're going to beat him
[1:55:29] if we're going to beat him
[1:55:31] I went back for the for the state
[1:55:33] competition the second year and I smoked
[1:55:36] them all so state champion once again
[1:55:41] it was it was a little boy that was so
[1:55:45] weary or so so scared and so timid and
[1:55:49] that's the reason I like all you young
[1:55:50] people I like I like I like to
[1:55:53] encouraging it to be everything that you
[1:55:55] can be don't you quit for anything
[1:55:57] you're a champ
[1:56:00] in heart
[1:56:03] before you're a champion
[1:56:05] in reality
[1:56:08] and you got to train for it
[1:56:10] and you've got to be ready for it
[1:56:12] and that's the reason why we gotta grow
[1:56:13] up this morning
[1:56:15] don't let the devil have his way don't
[1:56:18] let Satan do play his tricks with you
[1:56:22] you're a winner

[1:56:40] you're an overcomer
[1:56:42] amen
[1:56:44] yes Overcomers
[1:56:47] what we've got to do
[1:56:49] is lay aside all the weights
[1:56:52] you're going to have to train harder
[1:56:54] than all of those guys out there that
[1:56:56] think they've got it all in the bag they
[1:56:58] don't have it all in the bag like they
[1:57:00] think they've got it in the back but
[1:57:01] there's somebody that can have it in the
[1:57:03] bag
[1:57:04] if you'll train for it
[1:57:06] if you'll prepare for it
[1:57:09] lose them
[1:57:12] failing
[1:57:14] falling
[1:57:16] that does not define who you are
[1:57:19] that does not define who you are
[1:57:22] how many times
[1:57:24] did Mr Ford go bankrupt

[1:57:36] finally work
[1:57:38] come on
[1:57:40] how many times
[1:57:42] inventors they they worked and they
[1:57:46] worked they looked like they were losers
[1:57:49] because something was inside of them
[1:57:52] that was in their soul it was in their
[1:57:54] genetics it was part of their heart it
[1:57:56] was who they were everyone else says go
[1:57:58] get a job
[1:58:03] there they are
[1:58:05] eating peanut butter and jelly
[1:58:07] sandwiches that's they they didn't care
[1:58:09] they didn't care what they had anything
[1:58:10] they were just going to sit there and
[1:58:12] Tinker
[1:58:13] tinker and try to come up with something
[1:58:15] everyone else had
[1:58:16] life
[1:58:19] but our inventions that we have today
[1:58:21] come from Men
[1:58:23] that were willing
[1:58:25] to take it from here
[1:58:27] and put their Vin their own paper
[1:58:31] from paper
[1:58:32] somewhere else to reality
[1:58:36] aren't you women glad that there's
[1:58:38] somebody invented a dishwasher
[1:58:41] and a washing machine
[1:58:45] you men were concerned you say I got one
[1:58:47] when I got married but these women were
[1:58:49] glad when a dishwasher was invented amen
[1:58:53] Overcomers
[1:58:56] were Overcomers
[1:58:57] you love him the musicians would come
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:11] he that overcometh
[1:59:14] will I make a pillar
[1:59:18] in the temple
[1:59:20] of my God
[1:59:23] he that overcometh
[1:59:29] he should go no more out
[1:59:31] in other words he's not
[1:59:33] torn
[1:59:35] by this and invites every everything
[1:59:37] comes around and
[1:59:39] or you know what you caught up in this
[1:59:41] and you're caught up in that and you're
[1:59:46] you're making righteous decisions you're
[1:59:48] looking at things the way God sees these
[1:59:50] things
[1:59:52] you're not trying to look at the way to
[1:59:53] figure things out for your own self
[1:59:56] you're seeing things the way God sees
[1:59:57] them and you're just coming in line with
[1:59:59] What God Says
[2:00:02] you say Lord
[2:00:04] I'm going to be a part of your program
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:09] and as long as you're part of his
[2:00:10] program
[2:00:12] you're going to overcome
[2:00:15] you can resist the program if you want
[2:00:19] but you'll be a loser
[2:00:21] [Music]
[2:00:24] why not come in line
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:28] with God in his program
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:32] and by the way
[2:00:34] my instructor
[2:00:36] Lester Leake
[2:00:37] we have become lifelong Buddies
[2:00:44] he calls me occasionally
[2:00:46] checking on the boys he's all proud to
[2:00:48] hear the electrical contractors
[2:00:51] electricians
[2:00:53] and he tells me now
[2:00:55] I knew you had it in you I said yeah
[2:00:57] right
[2:01:01] he said I was just trying to bring it
[2:01:03] out of you all right
[2:01:07] we went to Nationals
[2:01:09] I didn't finish my story but
[2:01:11] we went to Nationals together Mr Lee
[2:01:14] and I stayed in the same room
[2:01:18] and he said well no you don't beat all
[2:01:23] foreign
[2:01:30] he started sharing his heart with me
[2:01:33] some of the circumstances in his family
[2:01:34] and things that nature and here I am
[2:01:37] at that time I'm a 17 year old kid
[2:01:41] [Music]
[2:01:51] and I said all I can say Mr Lee
[2:01:55] [Music]
[2:02:00] and I know that I'm born for a purpose
[2:02:06] and I believe that the law the more I
[2:02:07] can surrender myself to him
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:11] I said so maybe this is his purpose for
[2:02:13] me for right now is to
[2:02:16] win a championship
[2:02:20] as well are you going to win this one
[2:02:22] this is National
[2:02:24] we're talking about competing against
[2:02:26] a whole bunch more than you did stay
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:33] I want to give it everything I've got
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:38] But ultimately
[2:02:40] he's the one
[2:02:41] [Music]
[2:02:43] we become Buddies
[2:02:45] [Music]
[2:02:50] now whether or not he's he was telling
[2:02:52] the truth that he always knew or not I I
[2:02:54] I still have a hard time believing that
[2:02:59] but in this case
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:06] he wouldn't have given you this message
[2:03:10] he wouldn't have sent you a prophet
[2:03:13] he wouldn't have put that little
[2:03:15] something down on the inside of you
[2:03:16] saying
[2:03:17] I've got to win
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:22] I don't care where you are today
[2:03:26] you wouldn't have that little something
[2:03:28] that says I've cut well
[2:03:31] [Music]
[2:03:36] he loves you
[2:03:42] he gave you his spirit
[2:03:44] [Music]
[2:03:45] and he's not looking at you saying I
[2:03:47] hope you win you twerp
[2:03:49] God's already seen the end God knows
[2:03:53] you're going to win
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:04:05] I want people to believe in me to trust
[2:04:08] me
[2:04:10] But ultimately you can think what you
[2:04:12] want to think
[2:04:13] [Music]
[2:04:16] he knows
[2:04:18] he knows what he's doing in me he knows
[2:04:22] where I'm going he knows the work that
[2:04:25] he's performing in me he knows me he's
[2:04:29] created me he's made me who I am
