[39:33] as we have borne the image of the earthy
[39:37] we shall also bear the image of the
[39:40] Heavenly and uh I I I've got a a a crazy
[39:44] title this morning but amen I my my
[39:48] title could the real you step forward
[39:52] amen and back in the uh in the ' 50s
[39:57] they had the U the videos of uh or they
[40:00] they had a um um a TV show that was
[40:05] called tell the
[40:07] truth and uh uh and so uh there would
[40:13] there were three individuals claiming to
[40:15] be the same person and and so one was
[40:19] real and then two others were
[40:23] Impostors and so there would be a panel
[40:25] that would try to identify which one was
[40:28] the true amen and separate that
[40:31] individual from the ones that were
[40:34] claiming uh to be him or her and so when
[40:38] all the guessing was over and and and
[40:41] everyone is trying to figure out who
[40:43] this person is then they would ask the
[40:46] person with the real uh you the the
[40:49] individual stand up and and so then they
[40:55] would uh truly be able to ident identify
[40:58] who the real person was and and um I I I
[41:04] thought of this as I was uh thinking
[41:07] along these lines as I've been studying
[41:10] Amen in a world of Impostors there is a
[41:14] real you in in a world of Amen it's not
[41:19] what the world tells you who you are
[41:22] amen but it's it's who you genuinely are
[41:27] with within now amen most uh everyone in
[41:31] in the land are are going to put the
[41:34] value on the Earthly uh house that you
[41:38] live in and so they they put all uh of
[41:42] the attention all of the focus on your
[41:47] uh uh on your flesh and and and those
[41:51] concerns and that's the reason why amen
[41:54] uh all of the sin all of the all of the
[41:56] things that are that are out there uh
[42:00] today is appealing to your flesh
[42:03] everything is appealing to your flesh
[42:06] Satan puts his focus upon the physical
[42:11] your physical body amen and so and and
[42:15] and but we understand that there is you
[42:19] were created in the image of God Amen
[42:22] you're your your creation you are a a
[42:27] amen a being that lives in a physical
[42:31] house amen and that physical house has a
[42:34] name it it might wend Martin or it amen
[42:38] but the real you is living inside that
[42:42] house now Satan would try amen to to
[42:46] bring and cast doubt upon that body in
[42:50] which God Lives amen he always tried to
[42:53] do that with with Jesus if thou be the
[42:56] son of of God Amen the body of God then
[43:00] he makes his appeal to the flesh he
[43:02] tells he tells Jesus that amen he he he
[43:05] says command these stones to be turned
[43:07] into bread you're hungry amen but Jesus
[43:09] would always come back with the word and
[43:12] say it is written and and then he would
[43:14] he would make his appeal again and takes
[43:16] him on the Pinnacle of the temple and
[43:18] says uh amen you you know if just cast
[43:22] yourself on the ground and then the
[43:24] angels will will pick you up if you be
[43:27] the Son of God and then the third time
[43:29] he takes him and shows him all of the
[43:32] kingdoms of the world and says you can
[43:34] have them he was appealing to his flesh
[43:37] he was appealing to that body and he
[43:40] didn't realize that the God of all glory
[43:44] lived inside that body amen so he he was
[43:49] doing everything that he can to to
[43:52] attract amen through the pride of life
[43:55] amen the the lust of the eyes the lust
[43:58] of the flesh doing everything that would
[44:00] appeal this but he found the wrong guy
[44:03] because it was God living inside that
[44:08] house so while he was trying to appeal
[44:12] to the house amen he could not make his
[44:15] appeal because God lived in that house
[44:20] he was dealing with God can you say Amen
[44:24] now amen do you realize that evil
[44:27] Spirits they those Devils doubt who you
[44:29] are amen they doubt who you are and they
[44:33] try to get you to cast doubt in in your
[44:36] own mind in your own heart amen but
[44:39] brother Brandon would say do you ever
[44:41] think that inside of our body is another
[44:46] man did you know that there that there's
[44:49] another man inside our body he he would
[44:54] say Amen this Inside Man now if it is of
[44:58] god it's the spirit of God that's inside
[45:02] our being so so I want you to really
[45:05] catch this there is a there is a body
[45:09] amen you you live in that body but that
[45:12] which is on the inside is the spirit of
[45:15] God because the genetics of God are
[45:19] within you those your spirit rotated off
[45:23] of God as I'll I I'll give you a quote
[45:25] here in a minute amen it's the same
[45:28] spirit that that that God had when he
[45:32] resisted Satan is the same spirit that
[45:35] you have within you amen and I I I think
[45:38] that's just wonderful amen I I was going
[45:41] to try to find that just real quickly
[45:43] amen it was further on down in the in my
[45:46] in in my notes here but let me see if I
[45:48] can find it amen that spirit of God that
[45:52] something is within you I I I'm I'm glad
[45:55] for that now if you're going to win a
[45:58] battle amen now brother brother Brandon
[46:00] would say here's my analysis of that he
[46:02] says I think that people today that are
[46:05] possessed with this Spirit the spirit
[46:08] apart of these Angelic beings spirits
[46:11] that rotated off of God that never fell
[46:15] in the beginning and resisted the
[46:18] devil's lie in heaven so in your body
[46:23] amen is the spirit of the Living God
[46:27] amen you are you always were a son you
[46:31] are a son you will forever more be a son
[46:35] Satan doubts it and so he wants to do
[46:37] everything he can to to get to that God
[46:42] on the inside of you amen now if uh uh I
[46:46] I I want to say that you some would say
[46:49] well of course when you are amen uh a
[46:51] born again at an altar then you become a
[46:54] Son of God I say you always were a son
[47:01] you always did there the life the
[47:04] genetics of God within you were were in
[47:08] you at your birth amen so Satan does not
[47:13] want you to wake up he does not want the
[47:16] real you to come to frusion he wants to
[47:19] dampen you by the things of this Mortal
[47:23] life brother Bram would say Amen there
[47:25] in the church age book we have read it a
[47:27] couple times now amen he says the spirit
[47:30] of this world hates the spirit of God
[47:34] and because it can't overcome the spirit
[47:38] of the Lord it tries to destroy the
[47:42] vessel in whom the spirit of Truth
[47:44] dwells amen so now now I want you to
[47:48] understand this what has Satan been
[47:49] trying to do to you all of your life it
[47:52] is trying to hamper the life of God on
[47:56] the inside of you amen why do we have
[47:59] the pornography and why do we have amen
[48:01] all all of the the the the the lust and
[48:03] the and the claes and the pleasures of
[48:06] this life amen today trying to stop the
[48:09] spirit of God from coming to reality in
[48:13] your life well praise the Lord Amen
[48:16] brother Brandon we talk about how the
[48:17] Demons of hell all of these demons will
[48:20] come together amen and and they'll they
[48:23] they'll work in harmony to try to take
[48:26] out the spirit of God here on the earth
[48:29] yes amen now you you you've got to I I
[48:33] want you to stay with me in my thoughts
[48:35] here this morning because amen I I want
[48:37] you to understand that the only Jesus
[48:41] that this world will ever know is is is
[48:45] his Earthly body which is you and me
[48:48] here this morning the spirit of God is
[48:52] in his Earthly body today as it was in
[48:56] his Earthly body in Jesus Christ amen
[49:00] before the coming of the Lord you will
[49:02] never see amen Jesus Earthly body amen
[49:05] the physical body of Jesus Christ the
[49:08] spirit of God lives in human beings
[49:12] today and that's my intent I want that
[49:16] real you to step forward and claim who
[49:20] you are amen I know there's a lot of
[49:23] Impostors I know there's a lot of Amen
[49:25] mimics out there we're not worried about
[49:27] the mimics I want the real you to step
[49:29] forward and it ain't your pretty hair
[49:32] and it ain't your it ain't your good
[49:34] looks amen it is the spirit of God that
[49:37] rotated off of God in the beginning now
[49:41] Amen brother Brandon would talk about
[49:43] evil men and harmony with with the devil
[49:46] amen and and and and he would say
[49:49] anything to blight his name anything to
[49:51] ruin the confidence of the people not
[49:54] knowing that they were possessed of the
[49:56] devil do that they were working in
[49:59] harmony with the devil trying to blacken
[50:02] the name of the son of God Amen those
[50:05] spirits will do that now amen I I I I
[50:08] brother brother Brandon would also say
[50:10] he says now amen he said now if thou be
[50:13] the Son of God he's always doubted it
[50:16] and he still teaches others to doubt it
[50:19] he taught Eve to doubt it he taught
[50:22] Moses he taught all of them to try to
[50:24] doubt it and he's teaching you to doubt
[50:28] it also amen so I I I'm building my
[50:31] platform he's going to try to teach you
[50:35] to doubt the spirit of God in a body
[50:39] amen and if he doubted the the spirit of
[50:43] God living in the Virgin born son of God
[50:46] how much more is he going to doubt the
[50:49] spirit of God living in your mortal
[50:51] flesh amen if the perfect virgin born
[50:55] son and Satan was there to doubt and
[50:58] teaching others to doubt amen then that
[51:00] same uh spirit is here to anoint the
[51:03] people and will even anoint you Amen to
[51:06] doubt who you are but you've got to come
[51:09] back to scripture and then you will find
[51:12] out I am not a wannabe I am the
[51:15] real I am not a wannabe well praise the
[51:18] Lord amen now now we again again we live
[51:22] in a in in a in a society amen that that
[51:26] uh H H that is appealing to the flesh
[51:29] amen we live in a society that shows
[51:32] partiality to a flesh amen if you're
[51:34] poor amen you're treated as poor if
[51:37] you're rich you're treated as Rich if
[51:39] you're amen a politician or if you're
[51:41] this or that amen but I want to say that
[51:43] has nothing to do do you realize that
[51:45] God says that your flesh he will show no
[51:48] respect to your flesh whatsoever amen
[51:51] there in Romans 2:11 it says there is no
[51:54] respect of persons with God and the
[51:57] Amplified it says God shows no
[51:59] partiality no arbitrary favoritism with
[52:02] him one person is not more important
[52:05] than the other amen there in in 1 Peter
[52:08] 1:17 he says if you call on the on the
[52:11] father who without respect of persons
[52:14] judges according to Every Man's work
[52:17] amen now now now I want you to
[52:20] understand this we want to we want to
[52:23] try to amen H H uh lift a a a one person
[52:28] status amen or one person up in our mind
[52:31] or favor a certain person based on their
[52:34] status amen we want to do that that is
[52:38] not the way God works that's
[52:42] righten he doesn't work that way amen we
[52:45] want to say this one is favorable to me
[52:47] this one will bring a a a good good
[52:49] standing in the community this one will
[52:51] help uh uh amen help me in in in my step
[52:55] up the ladder or however you do it amen
[52:58] but God does not judge you or anyone in
[53:02] the kingdom of God according to their
[53:05] person amen your flesh will never will
[53:08] will never earn anything with God Amen
[53:10] and it should not earn anything with one
[53:13] another well can you say amen amen now
[53:16] now there in in Galatians 3 and 28 it
[53:19] says there is neither Jew nor Greek
[53:21] there is neither Bond nor free there is
[53:24] neither male nor female for ye are all
[53:28] one in Christ Jesus amen the he told
[53:32] there in James 2 and one he says my
[53:35] brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord
[53:37] Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with
[53:40] respect of persons if there come unto
[53:42] you uh come unto your assembly a man
[53:45] with a gold ring and goodly apparel and
[53:48] there come in also a poor man and V
[53:50] reignment and you have respected or
[53:53] respect to him that weareth the gay
[53:55] clothing amen man or the nice clothing
[53:57] and say unto him amen sit thou here in a
[54:01] good place and say to the poor stand
[54:04] thou there or sit under my footstool are
[54:06] ye then partial in yourselves are you
[54:10] become judges of evil thoughts now now
[54:13] what is what are the apostles trying to
[54:16] say as God is looking upon you so must
[54:21] you look at one another you don't look
[54:23] at each other according to the flesh
[54:26] because the flesh is not what God is
[54:29] looking at the flesh is only the house
[54:33] in which God lives in right hallelujah
[54:38] amen so we're we're not we're not
[54:40] interested in Amen in in in someone's
[54:43] person someone's Earthly rank amen but
[54:46] our interest is in the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:51] and that gift on the inside amen that's
[54:54] right uh uh there they there they're in
[54:57] Jude 1 and6 now Jude is talking about
[55:00] certain men that have crept in and the
[55:03] 16th verse he says these are are
[55:05] murmurers and complainers and walking
[55:07] after their own lust and their mouth
[55:09] speaketh great swelling words having
[55:12] men's persons in admiration because of
[55:16] Advantage amen but God's not looking to
[55:19] that so so so once again here amen I am
[55:23] saying it does not matter your position
[55:27] in the church when it comes to God it
[55:30] does not matter whether you are poor it
[55:32] does not matter whether you are rich it
[55:35] does not matter whether you're a
[55:36] preacher it does not matter whether
[55:38] you're amen just someone that comes to
[55:41] the congregation amen there is there is
[55:44] nothing that is held in any higher
[55:47] advantage in the kingdom of God other
[55:51] than the grace of God Upon Our Lives and
[55:55] that eternal Gene seed that is within
[55:58] you amen it's the genetics of God within
[56:02] you that makes you who you are amen now
[56:06] Hallelujah y'all can say Amen this
[56:08] morning if you agree amen or I I raise
[56:11] your hand and I'll try to explain it
[56:12] even better now so what we want I want
[56:15] to get this to the get our point across
[56:18] that the that this body cannot and will
[56:23] not ever earn anything with God if it's
[56:26] not going to earn anything with God that
[56:29] I say that we should not put much
[56:31] emphasis on this old body right amen now
[56:35] now we put a lot of emphasis on it but
[56:38] this is a house that you live in amen
[56:42] and just as your regular house has to
[56:44] have painting and and it has to have
[56:46] Renovations and after a while it has to
[56:48] be tore down this house that the spirit
[56:52] of God is living in is someday going to
[56:55] have to be amen put into the ground it's
[56:58] going to have to be bulldozed down
[57:00] because God can's not going to live in
[57:02] this house
[57:03] forever Hallelujah but the real you is
[57:07] going to move to another house amen well
[57:10] praise the Lord amen now Jesus had said
[57:13] now amen there in Luke 16 and4 and and
[57:18] and the Pharisees also who were Covetous
[57:20] and and heard all these things and they
[57:22] derided him and they and he said unto
[57:24] them ye are they which justify
[57:26] yourselves before men but God knows your
[57:30] hearts for that which is highly esteemed
[57:33] among men is an Abomination to the sight
[57:36] of God there in 2 Corinthians
[57:39] 5:16 amen now it begins to talk to us
[57:42] amen it's the Apostle Paul says
[57:44] wherefore henceforth know we no man
[57:47] after the flesh yay though we have known
[57:50] Christ after the flesh yet now
[57:52] henceforth know we him no more therefore
[57:55] If any man be in Christ he is a new
[57:59] creature old things are passed away and
[58:02] behold all things are become new amen
[58:06] now he's putting the difference now the
[58:08] seed that was within that body has come
[58:12] to life it has been born a new that man
[58:16] has all authority in the Kingdom of
[58:20] Heaven amen now you're still living in
[58:24] that body but you are a new creation
[58:28] amen you are still living in this body
[58:31] here you still have to comb it you still
[58:33] have to feed it you still have to bathe
[58:34] it you still have to do these things but
[58:37] your power comes from that new seed or
[58:42] that amen that seed that predestinated
[58:44] seed before the foundation of the world
[58:46] and it has now just been or uh uh
[58:48] energized can you say amen Amen brother
[58:50] brenon would say Amen this in the in the
[58:53] church age book he says now it says that
[58:56] Heath chosen Us in him Jesus before the
[58:58] foundation of the world that means you
[59:01] were right there with him somebody say
[59:05] hallelujah hallelujah in mind and
[59:07] thoughts of God before the foundation of
[59:09] the world he says that gives an eternal
[59:13] quality to the elect and you can't get
[59:17] away from that amen he goes on down he
[59:19] says these who are the Royal seed are
[59:22] the elect of God are the predestinated
[59:25] for more known of God and were in the
[59:28] mind of God and thoughts of God in very
[59:31] uh plain language the true bride of
[59:33] Jesus Christ was in the mind of God
[59:36] eternally amen though not expressed
[59:39] until each came forth in their
[59:41] designated decreed season as each member
[59:45] come forth it become expressed and took
[59:48] its place in the body so now I want now
[59:51] Hallelujah you're living in the body
[59:53] somebody says amen this old good-look
[59:55] body is good brother W amen but this is
[59:58] not who you are the life of God is on
[1:00:02] the inside of that body and there's
[1:00:05] where your Authority
[1:00:06] lies Hallelujah well praise the Lord
[1:00:10] some say well if I could just get into
[1:00:13] prayer and I think prayer is is
[1:00:14] important but you're just as powerful
[1:00:17] when you're struggling in your prayer
[1:00:18] life as you are when you're when you're
[1:00:22] uh in deep prayer you're just as
[1:00:24] powerful because it's not your prayer
[1:00:27] that does it it's not your fasting that
[1:00:30] does it it's not your church attendance
[1:00:33] that does it it's the genetics of God
[1:00:37] living in that
[1:00:39] body now there's going to be many people
[1:00:42] amen that put all the attention on the
[1:00:44] Flesh and they can pray every day of
[1:00:46] their life amen they can they can make a
[1:00:48] habit of doing these things amen and
[1:00:50] there are so many Traditions but yet if
[1:00:54] the seed of God is is not there they are
[1:00:57] just as weak as they were before they
[1:01:01] started because the genetics of God is
[1:01:05] Not In That
[1:01:07] Body amen can you say amen I I know many
[1:01:10] of people that has read the church age

[1:01:18] were not
[1:01:20] powerful they might have been powerful
[1:01:22] in mind they might have been powerful in
[1:01:24] their body they might have been powerful
[1:01:26] but they were not powerful before the
[1:01:28] enemy the
[1:01:30] devil because only the spirit of God can
[1:01:33] defeat the Devil amen so it's not your
[1:01:37] prayer the act of praying that defeats
[1:01:40] the devil it's not the act of coming to
[1:01:42] church that defeats the devil it's not
[1:01:45] the act of singing songs that defeats
[1:01:47] the devil it's who you are on the inside
[1:01:52] of you that makes you powerful all right

[1:02:37] Corinthians 5 and 1 and the Apostle Paul
[1:02:40] says Paul says we know that if our
[1:02:44] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[1:02:47] dissolved now what he's dealing with

[1:03:20] you're living in right now is has fallen
[1:03:23] apart and it's time time it's going to
[1:03:27] be time to move from this house into a
[1:03:31] new house and he says that new house
[1:03:35] will never fall apart that new house
[1:03:38] will never have aches and pains it will
[1:03:41] never go blind and have back aches amen
[1:03:43] that new house will be but you do not
[1:03:47] change you are just changing

[1:04:16] you rotated off of it amen as brother
[1:04:19] Brenham talks about the about the stars
[1:04:23] and about the galaxies amen he says
[1:04:25] these were were clinkers that that
[1:04:27] rotated off of the sun it came off the
[1:04:30] Sun and here you and I stand today as

[1:05:07] yourself from God can you say amen
[1:05:11] hallelujah he says if we earn to be
[1:05:13] clothed upon amen the third verse if so
[1:05:16] be that being clothed we shall not be
[1:05:18] found
[1:05:19] naked for that we that are in this house
[1:05:23] do Gran being burdened not for that we
[1:05:26] should be unclothed amen we don't want
[1:05:28] to we don't want to be without a house
[1:05:31] we've got to have a house you have got
[1:05:34] to have a house the spirit of God must
[1:05:38] live in a
[1:05:42] body got to live in a body Hallelujah so
[1:05:46] he not wanting to be unclothed amen but
[1:05:48] now it says uh we do grow being burden
[1:05:51] not that we should be unclothed but
[1:05:52] clothed upon that mortality might be
[1:05:56] swallowed up of life now brother Brandon
[1:05:58] would say this old Earthly Tabernacle
[1:06:00] here you know what it is it's the the
[1:06:02] body is like an old coat that you wear a
[1:06:06] coat that you once wear amen now that
[1:06:09] you have one so much better you don't

[1:06:16] better you've got a better coat if it's
[1:06:19] more up to date than the one that you
[1:06:21] used to wear that's wore out what it is

[1:06:38] bore the image of the Heavenly yet it's
[1:06:41] not you you are on the inside of the
[1:06:45] body now I want you to catch this you
[1:06:48] the spirit of God is on the inside of
[1:06:53] that body and that what makes the
[1:06:56] outside come into subjections because
[1:07:00] the inside is pulling it bringing it in
[1:07:02] line with the word of God you're inside
[1:07:05] you yourself your being this body is
[1:07:08] just a
[1:07:10] coat now what did he put there when he

[1:07:36] Eternal as

[1:07:46] body amen now he says now someday what
[1:07:51] will you do with it amen for for you it
[1:07:54] was only a garment for a while this is
[1:07:57] what the Earthly garment this body your
[1:07:59] real body the real self is on the inside
[1:08:02] of this coat that you call William
[1:08:04] brandham or Susie Jones or whoever it is
[1:08:06] someday it will hang in Earth's Hall of
[1:08:08] memory of you and and you'll put it out
[1:08:10] yonder in the grave and somebody will
[1:08:12] put up a stone here lies Reverend so and
[1:08:15] so John so and so or so and so it'll lie
[1:08:18] there is a memorial of you but people
[1:08:20] just seen you in this a the people just
[1:08:22] seen you in this but and what you was

[1:08:39] because this here hallelujah now now you
[1:08:42] you Hallelujah someone shout
[1:08:45] hallelujah amen coming to church does
[1:08:48] not make you powerful amen amen and the
[1:08:50] preacher does not make you
[1:08:53] powerful H H singing in the choir
[1:08:55] preaching a sermon does not make you
[1:08:57] powerful we're we we're not going to
[1:08:59] we're not going to to to to uh amen give
[1:09:03] any advantage to anyone's person that
[1:09:06] person is death that person this person
[1:09:10] up here will die and go to the Grave the
[1:09:13] only thing that is powerful in you is
[1:09:16] the life of God that created You In His
[1:09:23] Image thank can you say Amen now that
[1:09:27] you always were even when you were a
[1:09:30] even when you were a a sinner you were
[1:09:33] still a Son of God even when you were
[1:09:37] were out there painting the town red you
[1:09:39] were a Son of God you always were a Son
[1:09:45] of God living in this Mortal
[1:09:50] body
[1:09:52] Hallelujah you don't become you always
[1:09:54] were you you're just as Eternal as God
[1:09:57] was if you believe this
[1:10:01] message brother Brandon would
[1:10:04] say you always were a
[1:10:06] sheep you never were a pig or a dog
[1:10:10] turned into a sheep that is impossible
[1:10:14] for every kind of Life produces the same
[1:10:16] kind and there is no change in species
[1:10:19] as we were in the thoughts of God and
[1:10:21] then expressed in the flesh there had to
[1:10:24] come a day when we would hear his voice
[1:10:27] the word and hearing that voice become
[1:10:30] aware of our father calling us and
[1:10:32] recognize that we are Sons we heard his
[1:10:36] voice we cried out as the prodigal save
[1:10:39] me oh my father I'm returning to thee a
[1:10:42] Son of God can go a long time before he
[1:10:46] recognizes that he is a son but the son
[1:10:49] is always who you were
[1:10:53] amen amen now there's a reason why I'm
[1:10:57] taking this this line of
[1:11:00] thought because it's the adoption of
[1:11:03] sons in this last day that has been
[1:11:07] promised and some people think that the
[1:11:10] adoption is something that you earn you
[1:11:13] never will earn adoption in this body
[1:11:20] right but the sun is simply coming to
[1:11:23] maturity to understand who he is and
[1:11:27] will bring this body under his control
[1:11:30] all right well glory to God I said glory
[1:11:34] to God it's the nature of the word that
[1:11:39] is living in within you Hallelujah well
[1:11:43] praise the Lord amen oh it's the nature
[1:11:46] it's it's the nature of the word it's
[1:11:48] it's the there there's it's the
[1:11:49] pulsating of it's who you really are
[1:11:52] that is on the inside it was there in SE
[1:11:55] form amen and yes it had to become
[1:11:58] energized but it was always there that's
[1:12:01] who you always were that's who you
[1:12:04] always will
[1:12:06] be
[1:12:09] right and the guy that does all of the
[1:12:11] fleshly works can work and work and
[1:12:14] outwork you and it'll never make him
[1:12:17] powerful before God for God respects no
[1:12:21] man's person he respects no man's house
[1:12:25] he respects no I don't care whether you
[1:12:27] claiming that your house is a mansion
[1:12:30] amen God does not respect your house
[1:12:33] amen you might be the most beautiful
[1:12:35] girl around amen you don't have to have
[1:12:38] any Cosmetics God does not respect your
[1:12:42] house amen you might be a a famous
[1:12:45] preacher amen that everyone else is oh
[1:12:48] my God does not respect the
[1:12:53] house God God
[1:12:56] respects the person on the inside of
[1:13:00] that
[1:13:03] house
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:06] now that individual that come from God
[1:13:11] and is going back to God now it's the
[1:13:13] nature what is your nature it's all
[1:13:16] inside the seat of God Amen now those
[1:13:20] who are dominated by sin there it comes
[1:13:24] out out of their house amen it reflects
[1:13:27] out of their house they're they're Den
[1:13:30] they're dominated by sin amen they think
[1:13:32] about sinful things they do sinful
[1:13:35] things but those who have been born
[1:13:37] again and controlled by the spirit of
[1:13:38] God Amen the scripture says they're full
[1:13:40] of peace and they're full of joy and
[1:13:43] they're full of righteousness in the
[1:13:45] Holy Ghost can you say Amen that person
[1:13:49] that lives on the inside of well glory

[1:14:35] trucky yard and he had his old overalls
[1:14:38] on hadn't shaved and he was just sitting
[1:14:41] out there on the docks or standing out
[1:14:42] there on the docks leaning against the
[1:14:43] building and and and and my uncle says
[1:14:46] hey Pops I'll give you five bucks if you
[1:14:48] go out there and clean out if you go out

[1:15:01] he gives him his five bucks amen and
[1:15:03] some others that were standing around uh

[1:15:08] they said you're an idiot they said who

[1:15:28] see he looked at him as a bomb standing
[1:15:31] out there when he was the
[1:15:34] owner and I just want to let the devil
[1:15:36] know you might think that there's a buom
[1:15:39] living in this house but within me is
[1:15:42] the owner and the possessor of all
[1:15:47] things and while you've got this world
[1:15:49] on a temporal hold I'm a Son of God I
[1:15:53] possess all all things though I'm living
[1:15:57] in this little mortal
[1:16:00] body you see Satan has always been the
[1:16:04] respector of persons he was respecting
[1:16:07] and lifting up the high priest when
[1:16:10] Jesus was on the earth and he was
[1:16:11] putting down Jesus amen Jesus he says oh
[1:16:15] you you're you're you're uh born of
[1:16:17] fornication amen you're an illegitimate
[1:16:20] child and they were always pointing to
[1:16:23] his person always pointing to that body
[1:16:26] always pointing to amen what you know
[1:16:29] when he would say destroy this Temple
[1:16:30] and I'll raise it up and and there he
[1:16:32] turns around they said how are you going
[1:16:34] to do this amen how are well can you say
[1:16:36] Amen Jesus says before Abraham was I am
[1:16:40] and they look and says hey come on
[1:16:42] you're not even over 30 years old or
[1:16:44] over 50 years old and here you are but
[1:16:47] you see they did not
[1:16:51] realize that the God of all glory
[1:16:55] was living in that
[1:16:59] house oh can you say Amen they were so
[1:17:03] into respecting the persons so into
[1:17:07] respecting the high priest and the
[1:17:09] positions of the Pharisees and the
[1:17:11] positions of the Sadducees and the
[1:17:13] positions of the scribes they were so
[1:17:16] into all of their Earthly positions that
[1:17:20] they did not recognize the Lord Of Glory
[1:17:24] was living right next door to
[1:17:29] them in a
[1:17:31] house can you say amen amen when Jesus
[1:17:35] was there and and and even his
[1:17:38] disciples as they were out there on the
[1:17:40] water and they they're about go all over
[1:17:43] the place and they Jesus is asleep and
[1:17:46] amen the god the god in that body wasn't
[1:17:48] a bit wasn't a bit worried amen God
[1:17:51] lived in that body and that body was
[1:17:53] peaceful Hallelujah but they finally
[1:17:55] wake Jesus up and says do you care lest
[1:17:57] we perish he said man the storms are
[1:17:59] taking us under and you're sleeping on
[1:18:00] us Jesus gets up and yawns and stretches
[1:18:03] for a minute and he says oh ye of little
[1:18:06] faith how long amen and he puts his foot
[1:18:09] on the brow of the bow of the ship and
[1:18:12] he says amen
[1:18:14] peace be
[1:18:18] still now that was spoken through this
[1:18:21] mtle
[1:18:25] decaying house brother bradam says the
[1:18:27] reason why they said you're not over 50
[1:18:29] is because he looked like he was 50 he
[1:18:31] was he was old he was amen with all the
[1:18:34] the visions and all of the pressures and
[1:18:36] all of the things that he had gone
[1:18:38] through Amen in that mortal body he
[1:18:40] looked like he was an old man and there
[1:18:42] he was a young man amen but when he
[1:18:45] stood there it was the god of glory and
[1:18:49] what did the disciples say the disciples
[1:18:51] says what manner of man is
[1:18:55] this for even the winds and the waves
[1:19:00] obey him well I want to tell you he was
[1:19:03] more than just a man it was the God of
[1:19:07] all glory living in that man now I
[1:19:11] understand amen I understand that that
[1:19:14] that that within him he was the god
[1:19:17] Tabernacle in a physical body singular
[1:19:21] but I'm here to tell you today it is
[1:19:23] that great God since the pillar of fire
[1:19:26] separated himself on the day of
[1:19:28] Pentecost he is still giving a portion
[1:19:31] of himself and energizing your seed you
[1:19:35] are just as powerful because God lives
[1:19:40] in your
[1:19:46] house it was that being that Abraham or
[1:19:51] that that Adam was at the beginning
[1:19:54] living in an Earthly house brother
[1:19:59] bradam would put it this way he says now
[1:20:01] there's something that's wrong in the
[1:20:04] beginning God created you to master to
[1:20:08] be the master of every situation that's
[1:20:10] the origin that's authentic that's God's
[1:20:14] word there was nothing nothing could
[1:20:17] happen unless you was the master of it
[1:20:21] that is what you were created for
[1:20:28] right but then Satan started pointing to
[1:20:30] the body Satan started pointing to the
[1:20:33] house Satan lured Eve away from the
[1:20:36] promise and started well glory to God
[1:20:41] Amen and then when mat brother Brandon
[1:20:43] would say and there is where man fell
[1:20:45] when he found how to recreate the
[1:20:47] body of
[1:20:49] man amen through the sexual but that was
[1:20:53] not the way God origin Ally intended now
[1:20:56] we're that does not change the fact that
[1:20:58] they're sons of God does not change the
[1:21:00] fact that you're decreed for every
[1:21:02] season it does not change the fact it's
[1:21:04] just that your house is now tainted it's
[1:21:06] wore out it's your mind is is measurable
[1:21:10] falling apart but within that house
[1:21:13] somebody say within my house my house is
[1:21:17] the holy spirit Spirit amen now I know
[1:21:21] some's going to say you're you're you're
[1:21:22] really bad I remember amen one time I
[1:21:24] was preaching and I said amen don't call
[1:21:27] me sinner call me Mrs Jesus Christ and
[1:21:30] and a man stopped amen and says listen
[1:21:32] you're going to always be a sinner amen
[1:21:35] you're going to always and you are don't
[1:21:37] put yourself up there with Jesus Christ
[1:21:39] amen I said I am the righteousness of
[1:21:42] God in Jesus Christ Christ took my shame
[1:21:47] that I could become his
[1:21:50] righteousness I am his bride I am am the
[1:21:55] reason he came in a house to begin
[1:21:59] [Applause]
[1:22:05] with now that's authentic that's in the
[1:22:08] fundamental foundation for Faith and
[1:22:10] that's a hard message to listen to
[1:22:12] because of the uh uh it's but I'm want
[1:22:15] to tell you there's not a there's a
[1:22:17] powerful message that Foundation that
[1:22:21] fundamental foundation for Faith and I
[1:22:23] would say it's worth amen turning it up
[1:22:26] and listening through all the screeches
[1:22:28] uh trying to understand and then read
[1:22:30] along with that because I'm telling you
[1:22:32] brother brandham gave some Secrets the
[1:22:35] entire message start to finish is like
[1:22:37] blow you away blow you away on what
[1:22:40] brother brandom is saying through a
[1:22:41] prophetic eye amen but then in in
[1:22:45] perfect Faith 1963 after the seals of
[1:22:48] being born he says now notice now
[1:22:50] another perfect faith is a master of all
[1:22:55] circumstances now now I want you to
[1:22:57] understand remember this at the
[1:22:59] beginning God created you to master
[1:23:01] every circumstance that's the origin
[1:23:02] that's authentic that's God's word
[1:23:04] nothing can happen unless you were the
[1:23:05] master of it he said now something's
[1:23:07] wrong amen but now we come to perfect
[1:23:10] faith and he says perfect faith is a
[1:23:13] master of all circumstances perfect
[1:23:16] Faith Masters all circumstances no
[1:23:19] matter what it is it Masters it just
[1:23:21] watch when you believe anything do
[1:23:23] anything you got faith in what you're
[1:23:25] doing no matter what the circumstance is
[1:23:28] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:23:31] it Masters that circumstance if it's in
[1:23:35] a room of sickness the Lord reveals that
[1:23:37] this certain thing's going to happen you
[1:23:39] speak it and you go on you're not
[1:23:43] judging the
[1:23:45] circumstances according to sight feel
[1:23:48] smell and hear and taste you are judging
[1:23:51] it by the inward mind of who you are
[1:23:56] well praise the Lord I said hallelujah
[1:23:59] amen do you realize that no matter what
[1:24:02] you are this
[1:24:04] Earth this this outside body and the
[1:24:07] circumstances I don't care if the rain
[1:24:10] is hitting it if the snow is hitting it
[1:24:12] if the Sunshine's hitting it amen I
[1:24:14] don't care if the wind's blowing against
[1:24:15] it the shingles are falling off and amen
[1:24:18] it needs to be painted and everything
[1:24:19] else amen that it does not affect the
[1:24:22] man that is on the inside of the house
[1:24:25] the man's on the inside of the house is
[1:24:26] the powerful one not the house I I'm
[1:24:29] going to keep on saying it the man on
[1:24:31] the inside of the house is the powerful
[1:24:34] one come on church amen and the Apostle
[1:24:37] Paul there in in the Book of Romans
[1:24:39] the8th chapter he says now we're not of
[1:24:42] the spirit or of the flesh but we are of
[1:24:45] the spirit we're not walking after the
[1:24:47] flesh we're walking according to the
[1:24:49] spirit he says if the spirit of Christ
[1:24:53] the the the spirit that raised up Christ
[1:24:55] from the dead dwell in you it will
[1:24:58] Quicken it will Quicken your mortal
[1:25:03] bodies can you say amen amen there there
[1:25:06] Romans 8 and5 it says they that are
[1:25:09] after The Flesh do mind the things of
[1:25:11] the flesh they that are after the spirit
[1:25:13] the things of the spirit for to be
[1:25:15] carnally minded is death but to be
[1:25:17] spiritually minded is life and peace
[1:25:21] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:25:23] against God for for it is not subject to
[1:25:25] the law of God neither indeed can be now
[1:25:29] how does this peace come amen how does
[1:25:32] this life come it comes from a inward
[1:25:37] man who is satisfied with who they
[1:25:42] are
[1:25:45] now as I begin to try to bring my pieces
[1:25:49] together peace does not come
[1:25:54] by anything
[1:25:56] Earthly because this world is controlled
[1:26:00] by sin and
[1:26:02] death nothing nothing nothing nothing
[1:26:04] nothing nothing nothing you say h I just
[1:26:07] got
[1:26:08] promoted what promotion you talking
[1:26:10] about your
[1:26:13] house or the man living in the
[1:26:16] house with the promotion might come more
[1:26:19] money but it doesn't bring more peace it
[1:26:22] doesn't bring more happiness
[1:26:24] it doesn't bring anything like
[1:26:26] that so the
[1:26:29] promotions of this
[1:26:31] flesh does very little for
[1:26:35] you
[1:26:37] amen but the nature of the spirit within
[1:26:41] you Finds Its
[1:26:44] peace in
[1:26:51] him praise the
[1:26:53] Lord therefore you can stand as God
[1:26:55] stands and say
[1:26:58] Amen or as as the Apostle Paul amen as
[1:27:02] as as as that they had been 19 days I
[1:27:05] believe it was on the on the Seas and
[1:27:07] and the boat was falling apart and
[1:27:09] everyone was fixing to take their lives
[1:27:10] and Paul says fear not take not your
[1:27:12] life we're all here everything's okay
[1:27:15] amen for the god whom I serve has
[1:27:18] visited me last night and told me that
[1:27:21] everything's going to be okayu told me
[1:27:23] everything everything going to be okay
[1:27:25] and they're all said well who are you he
[1:27:27] says no no no no listen to me amen if
[1:27:31] you you're going to have to cut the
[1:27:32] lifeboats off cut them all off amen the
[1:27:35] ship is going to sink that is that is
[1:27:37] true but I'm here to tell you if you
[1:27:39] stick with me amen there shall not one
[1:27:42] of us be lost all right there shall not
[1:27:45] one because the god whom I serve sent an
[1:27:48] angel to me last night and told me that
[1:27:50] worked well praise the Lord what was he
[1:27:53] saying oh yes this this thing here goes
[1:27:56] back and forth but I've Got Confidence
[1:27:58] in my god I've Got Confidence well can
[1:28:01] you say amen amen you see words in
[1:28:05] themselves have no value amen anyone can
[1:28:08] confess the words of God anyone can
[1:28:10] confess it but it's not just not just
[1:28:12] the words that's being said it's it's
[1:28:15] the sons of God it's the person that
[1:28:18] lives in your
[1:28:20] house that is speaking those words that
[1:28:23] makes those those words come to pass
[1:28:28] right amen
[1:28:31] now they they're in James James told us
[1:28:35] amen James says that you can't tame that
[1:28:37] tongue that tongue will not be tamed
[1:28:39] it's it's it's it's it's going to say
[1:28:41] what it wants to it's going to do well
[1:28:43] praise the Lord amen and James says and
[1:28:46] it's because of the inside amen the
[1:28:49] fountain wherever the fountain is it you
[1:28:52] can't have good water
[1:28:54] and bad water coming out of it at the
[1:28:56] same time and if we've got the power of
[1:28:59] the Holy Spirit within us it is to
[1:29:01] dictate what we think what we say how we
[1:29:05] react in every situation of Our
[1:29:08] Lives well come on church amen yes there
[1:29:12] is another law on the inside of you I
[1:29:15] understand that that's your spirit man
[1:29:17] it's the nature of the flesh that's how
[1:29:19] you think that's how you that's how that
[1:29:21] that's how amen you live in this body
[1:29:24] can function but I will say that the
[1:29:27] soul of man is where the god of Glory
[1:29:30] that Eternal Jean seed that rotated off
[1:29:33] of God
[1:29:36] lives and there's where there's where
[1:29:39] the authority comes from amen we we
[1:29:41] preached here we've taken a few services
[1:29:44] on that confession he's the high priest
[1:29:47] he's the Apostle and the high priest of
[1:29:49] our confession the Apostle is the one
[1:29:52] the originator it's the one that that
[1:29:54] brought the confession together in the
[1:29:56] first place and now then he is the high
[1:29:58] priest of that confession amen he is
[1:30:01] interceding that the word of God can
[1:30:03] come forth so he is the Apostle and the
[1:30:05] high priest the apostle was the
[1:30:07] originator he is the he is the author
[1:30:10] and the finisher of our faith if you
[1:30:12] want to just bring it into our terms
[1:30:14] amen the author and the finisher he is
[1:30:17] the he is the he he he is the Apostle
[1:30:21] the originator the anointed one of God
[1:30:24] that got you started and he will be that
[1:30:28] amen faithful high priest to the things
[1:30:31] of God concerning you and will take you
[1:30:34] to your finished
[1:30:36] line confession where is that confession
[1:30:40] you are brother bradam would say you are
[1:30:43] there are two
[1:30:45] omnipotence Hallelujah we want to put
[1:30:47] God as being the only omnipotent brother
[1:30:50] Brandon says that's not correct he says
[1:30:53] you are are omnipotent because you came
[1:30:57] from God Amen he says so when God the
[1:31:01] omnipotent and the son the omnipotent
[1:31:04] comes together and confessing what God
[1:31:08] has said he said nothing will stand in
[1:31:11] that man's
[1:31:13] way Hallelujah is that right amen that's
[1:31:19] right brother Joe sent something uh uh
[1:31:21] uh yesterday and and went along with
[1:31:23] what I was preaching here this morning
[1:31:24] so uh I I appreciate him putting that on
[1:31:27] there amen the devil has no power over
[1:31:29] you but he wants to get you to doubt who
[1:31:32] you are amen and so when he does he
[1:31:34] starts he starts putting in these these
[1:31:37] thoughts and he starts putting this in
[1:31:38] there and your words and before you know
[1:31:40] it amen you're bringing the curse on
[1:31:42] yourself because you are a son of God
[1:31:46] and your words matter that's right
[1:31:49] someone say I'm a son I'm a son and my
[1:31:52] words matter
[1:31:55] you can bring a curse upon you by not
[1:31:58] speaking the way God says to
[1:32:01] speak by not believing the way God Satan
[1:32:05] has no power over
[1:32:09] you unless you give it to
[1:32:12] him but you are you have peace and
[1:32:17] righteousness amen by the blood of Jesus
[1:32:19] Christ by that new birth that is within
[1:32:22] you can you say Amen
[1:32:24] now Jesus would say there in in Matthew
[1:32:26] 12 and 33 he says either make the tree
[1:32:29] good his fruit good or else make the
[1:32:31] tree corupt and his fruit corrup for the
[1:32:33] tree is known by his fruit oh Generation
[1:32:35] of Vipers how can ye being evil speak
[1:32:38] good things for out of the abundance of
[1:32:40] the heart the mouth speaketh a good man
[1:32:42] out of the good Treasure of his heart
[1:32:44] bringeth forth good things and an evil
[1:32:46] man out of the evil treasure bringeth
[1:32:48] forth evil things so Jesus is putting it
[1:32:50] here it's all starts with who you are
[1:32:53] are on the inside
[1:32:58] right an evil
[1:33:00] man from an evil heart brings out evil
[1:33:07] things and the seed of God from the very
[1:33:12] life of God speaks the words of God and
[1:33:17] brings
[1:33:20] peace can you say
[1:33:22] Amen now now now watch
[1:33:25] this the very next words and Jesus but
[1:33:29] uh 36th verse but I say unto you that
[1:33:32] every Idol word that men shall speak
[1:33:37] they shall give an account thereof in
[1:33:40] the day of judgment for by thy words
[1:33:42] Thou shalt be justified and by thy words
[1:33:46] Thou shalt be
[1:33:51] condemned oh no no no brother when no
[1:33:53] you I come to church every not that he
[1:33:57] respects nobody's person remember he's
[1:34:00] not a respector of persons we he said
[1:34:02] now you guys respect persons you bring
[1:34:04] the rich and the poor and all that that
[1:34:05] God says that that don't work with me
[1:34:07] now now now what I'm talking about is
[1:34:08] the guy that's living on the inside now
[1:34:10] let's talk about
[1:34:14] that because you're powerful not by the
[1:34:17] house you're
[1:34:20] powerful because of what lives inside
[1:34:22] that house yes amen
[1:34:24] amen well praise the Lord God don't want
[1:34:28] you being religious God wants you to be
[1:34:31] powerful God's not created you to look
[1:34:33] pretty God's created you to be
[1:34:36] powerful God's not created you to have
[1:34:39] your name on a roll somewhere he's
[1:34:41] created you to be
[1:34:44] powerful can you say
[1:34:46] Amen I've always told the boys I don't
[1:34:49] care where you work what you do you're
[1:34:51] powerful it don't matter it's not it's
[1:34:53] not a bad deal to work underneath
[1:34:54] somebody it's not a bad deal to be to be
[1:34:57] the boss it does it does not matter amen
[1:34:59] your rank yes it might help you a little
[1:35:01] bit with your money Amen on on on on
[1:35:04] what you on what you make and things of
[1:35:06] that nature but that does not determine
[1:35:08] who you
[1:35:10] are you're powerful because of what God
[1:35:14] created in you before the foundation of
[1:35:17] the
[1:35:18] world can you say Amen right brother
[1:35:21] bradam says you want all power he says
[1:35:23] you want you want me to show you how to
[1:35:24] be
[1:35:25] powerful he said you think powerful is
[1:35:28] running up and down the aisles he me in
[1:35:30] dancing he said I say power is that
[1:35:34] something on the inside of a man that'll
[1:35:36] control his tongue that'll control his
[1:35:39] thoughts that'll control him himself he
[1:35:42] says that is power amen yes what's he
[1:35:47] talking about because in you lives the
[1:35:50] all powerful one can you say Amen
[1:35:58] Now
[1:36:00] power is within you and the authority
[1:36:05] comes out of you the power is the
[1:36:08] Eternal God within you you're not
[1:36:10] powerful but you've been given the
[1:36:12] authority to speak what that
[1:36:16] word of the Eternal God has placed so
[1:36:19] when he says now when a when a mortal
[1:36:22] man take the Divine words upon human
[1:36:26] lips he says that is the same thing as
[1:36:30] deity itself
[1:36:33] speaking for it is God in that
[1:36:38] man well
[1:36:42] Glory teach my words teach my mouth
[1:36:46] teach me Lord Ecclesiastes 12:9 moreover
[1:36:52] because the preacher was wise
[1:36:54] he still taught the people knowledge yay
[1:36:56] he gave good heed and sought out and
[1:37:00] said in order many Proverbs the preacher
[1:37:02] sought to accept or to find out
[1:37:05] acceptable words that was
[1:37:08] written and that which was written was
[1:37:11] upright even words of truth the words of
[1:37:15] the wise are as
[1:37:17] Golds and nails and As Nails fastened by
[1:37:20] the masters of assemblies which which
[1:37:23] are given from one Shepherd can you say
[1:37:26] Amen gold what what is what what is a
[1:37:29] cattle prod
[1:37:34] gold get you right where you need to
[1:37:38] be and there also was
[1:37:40] Nails that'll keep you anchored can you
[1:37:44] say
[1:37:45] Amen
[1:37:47] now as I get ready to
[1:37:50] close brother brandom when he's talking
[1:37:53] talking about the position of the
[1:37:54] believer in Christ and that is the that
[1:37:56] is the title that I'm of the of the
[1:37:59] sermon that I'm quoting from the
[1:38:01] position of a believer in Christ and so
[1:38:04] brother brother bradam is talking about
[1:38:06] position he's talking about
[1:38:09] Authority he's talking about
[1:38:14] sunship and he's given the reason as to
[1:38:18] why sons of
[1:38:20] God can go through life
[1:38:27] powerless Hallelujah you say a Son of
[1:38:29] God can go through life powerless yeah
[1:38:31] yeah yeah if he's going to put all of
[1:38:35] his attention on the
[1:38:37] house instead of the person in the
[1:38:40] house Hallelujah I'm here to tell you
[1:38:43] your house is you know pretty cute out
[1:38:45] on those on those pews but those houses
[1:38:47] mean nothing to
[1:38:48] God all
[1:38:50] right now he says now now the whole
[1:38:53] earth the whole room here is full of the
[1:38:55] power of God enough to make this boy
[1:38:58] sitting here in this wheelchair walk
[1:39:00] make this woman walk make this lady in
[1:39:03] the stretcher walk make all these people
[1:39:05] along here walk make the blind to see
[1:39:08] but the first things you have to do is
[1:39:09] get the Holy Spirit flowing in the right
[1:39:13] category do you believe it it's here
[1:39:17] what if you had an artisian well over on
[1:39:20] this mountain and a crop burning up over
[1:39:23] on this
[1:39:24] mountain and you sit there
[1:39:27] hollering and and and you hollering oh
[1:39:30] you great gusher water gushing water you
[1:39:33] great gushing water go over there and
[1:39:36] water my crops oh you great gushing
[1:39:39] water go over there and water my
[1:39:42] crop you'll make yourself
[1:39:45] horse and it will never move all right
[1:39:49] you can scream you can cry you can shout
[1:39:54] you can run you could speak in tongues
[1:39:58] you can jump up and down you could sing
[1:40:01] songs you could preach the gospel but
[1:40:04] until you work in harmony with the Holy
[1:40:09] Ghost you'll make yourself horse and get
[1:40:16] nowhere amen so now now now he's saying
[1:40:20] in the room on the on wait the problem
[1:40:23] is not the glory of the Lord on the
[1:40:25] earth the glory of the Lord is on the
[1:40:26] earth as he's promised the glory of the
[1:40:29] Lord is to cover the Earth as the water
[1:40:30] covers the sea amen it's this is it this
[1:40:33] is this is it we're we're in the glory
[1:40:36] of the Lord you say this don't look
[1:40:38] gloryful to me this is the greatest time
[1:40:41] brother brandom says if I were if I were
[1:40:44] to pick any age if I had my choice of
[1:40:47] any age Jesus on Earth and then all the
[1:40:50] Seven Ages I would pick this day because

[1:45:51] your life the spirit life tonight that
[1:45:53] was in God the Father before there was
[1:45:56] even a molecule and you are nothing but

[1:46:30] that Shack that can't be God but God
[1:46:33] lives in the
[1:46:34] shack God lives in the shack oh
[1:46:37] hallelujah oh come on now well they're
[1:46:40] not even known by anywhere they're not
[1:46:41] even known by this one or that they're
[1:46:42] not known it don't matter the God of all
[1:46:45] glory lives in that Jack
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:56] I when looking over my notes I came
[1:47:00] across I came across another one and and
[1:47:04] um I I I don't even I don't even know
[1:47:07] where where it's at and I think I put it
[1:47:09] in here but uh but brother brandham he
[1:47:15] he's he's he's talking about amen the
[1:47:19] the Holy Ghost and he says now and and
[1:47:23] and I'll bring it tonight just read it
[1:47:25] to you because it it sounds totally out
[1:47:27] there he says the Holy Ghost is a
[1:47:32] temporal
[1:47:35] gift he said your soul is the real
[1:47:44] gift baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:47:47] temporal
[1:47:48] gift and your soul is the real gift and
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:54] and then he goes on to explain it says
[1:47:56] it's the soul the genan seed of
[1:48:01] God that the Holy Spirit comes
[1:48:06] upon the spirit is falling upon All
[1:48:13] Flesh the guy next to you might not
[1:48:17] have the soul the genan seed of God the
[1:48:23] image of
[1:48:27] God but the Holy Ghost is causing him
[1:48:31] to
[1:48:33] jump causing him to act making him
[1:48:37] religious that's a temporal
[1:48:40] gift for that
[1:48:44] man what he's missing is the soul with
[1:48:47] the gerti
[1:48:51] seed so the spirit is falling upon the
[1:48:54] just and the unjust but I'm so thankful
[1:48:57] for God's seed on the inside that has
[1:48:59] been
[1:49:00] energized it's not a temporal gift for
[1:49:02] the believer because he has a
[1:49:06] soul in the image of
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:11] God we're not we're we're we're what I'm
[1:49:14] saying is temporal see what I'm saying
[1:49:18] is is we're living in a lot of craziness
[1:49:21] where these these bodies come temporal
[1:49:24] to church and the spirit falls on
[1:49:28] bodies and people say
[1:49:31] woo and then they go to the next meeting
[1:49:34] and they bring their they bring their
[1:49:36] houses and the rain falls on the house
[1:49:39] and they shout and speak in tongues and
[1:49:42] they
[1:49:46] ha but God respects no persons it's the
[1:49:49] same Holy Ghost
[1:49:54] but
[1:49:55] power is not what's falling on the roof
[1:49:59] of the
[1:50:00] house power is the man living in the
[1:50:04] house power is the Holy Ghost germinated
[1:50:08] seed on the inside of
[1:50:12] you you're
[1:50:15] powerful and you ain't powerful because
[1:50:17] you feel like you are you're powerful
[1:50:18] because the genetics of God on the
[1:50:20] inside of you yes
[1:50:22] [Music]
[1:50:25] now my thoughts this morning is
[1:50:27] this if you're looking in the mirror and
[1:50:30] what you see in the mirror is more
[1:50:31] important to you and what you see on
[1:50:33] your on your text and phones is more
[1:50:36] important to you and what you have on
[1:50:38] the
[1:50:39] inside you need to revalue things in
[1:50:42] your
[1:50:43] life I can say you're powerful God can
[1:50:46] say you're
