[44:21] a good time.
[44:24] As good a time as you can have and u
[44:27] been praying for them. Let's look here.
[44:31] Um, I've got a couple of scriptures I'd
[44:32] like to read here this morning. And I'd
[44:34] like to start off with Song of Solomon,
[44:37] uh, the 2 chapter.
[44:40] And, um,
[44:42] brother brother William is, sister
[44:45] Sharon will be with us here, uh, this
[44:48] evening and, uh, Brother William will be
[44:51] ministering here for us. And um um so
[44:58] they they've been over there with
[45:00] brother Sam Parker the last couple days
[45:04] and um
[45:07] so we're glad glad to have them back uh
[45:12] over here in Oklahoma and looking
[45:15] forward to seeing them here this
[45:17] evening.
[45:19] Um, Song of Solomon 2 and 1, it says,
[45:26] this is this is Jesus speaking to his
[45:28] bride. I am the rose of Sharon and the
[45:31] lily of the valleys.
[45:33] As the lily among thorns, so is my love
[45:36] among the daughters. the bride. As the
[45:42] um the apple tree among the trees of the
[45:46] woods, so was my beloved among the sons.
[45:50] I sat down under his shadow with great
[45:53] delight, and his fruit was sweet to my
[45:56] taste. He brought me to this to the
[45:59] banqueting house, and his banner over me
[46:03] was love. And then I'd also like to look
[46:07] here
[46:08] at um Ephesians 5 and 25. It's a
[46:12] familiar passage of scripture.
[46:15] And um [clears throat]
[46:18] uh there in Ephesians 5 and 25.
[46:23] Husbands, love your wives even as Christ
[46:25] also loved the church and gave himself
[46:28] for it, that he might sanctify and
[46:31] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[46:33] the word,
[46:35] that he may present it to himself a
[46:38] glorious church, not having spot or
[46:41] wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
[46:44] should be holy and without blemish. So
[46:49] the end product is a matured bride.
[46:52] Amen. That he is going to
[46:56] uh present to himself. And then
[47:01] revelations 19 and7
[47:05] it says let us be glad and rejoice and
[47:08] give honor to him for the marriage of
[47:12] the lamb is come
[47:15] and his wife has made herself ready. Now
[47:20] how was she going to make herself ready?
[47:22] By the word. It was going to be the
[47:24] bleeding word. the word would be
[47:26] presented in such a way it would come to
[47:29] her. Amen. That she would be without
[47:32] spot, wrinkle or blemish. Now it says
[47:36] the bride for the marriage of the lamb
[47:38] has come and his wife has made herself
[47:41] ready and to her was granted that she
[47:44] should be arrayed with fine linen clean
[47:47] and white. For the fine linen is the
[47:50] righteousness of the saints. What is the
[47:53] righteousness? How do we get
[47:55] righteousness? Abraham believed God and
[47:59] it was imputed unto him for
[48:01] righteousness. I want to speak this
[48:04] morning standing under the banner that
[48:06] is lifted high. Let's go to the Lord in
[48:09] prayer. Father, we thank you today for
[48:11] your blessings,
[48:13] the multitudes of your mercies, Lord.
[48:17] Thank you for your word and in our
[48:20] generation and having this confidence,
[48:23] Lord, that all things, Lord, that you
[48:26] you you have given us everything that we
[48:29] have need of to come into that complete
[48:32] maturity with you. Now, Lord, you you
[48:35] see as our uh there's there's several
[48:38] missing this morning and maybe we're
[48:40] still with family and I just pray Lord
[48:42] that you be with all of them. I ask Lord
[48:45] that your Holy Spirit would be here with
[48:47] us this morning as we uh set at your
[48:51] feet as it were to to hear from you and
[48:55] ask that you would minister to our
[48:57] hearts, Lord. Let your words hit the
[49:00] target, Father. And we'll give you glory
[49:02] and honor in Jesus name we pray. Can the
[49:06] church say amen?
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be
[49:10] seated here this morning.
[49:12] [clears throat]
[49:14] So we we have this in our in our
[49:17] thoughts here this morning standing
[49:20] under the banner lifted high and um um
[49:27] my my thoughts is is uh to to sort of go
[49:31] along with last with last week and that
[49:35] is amen the emblem uh of our country the
[49:39] the banner that was given to to us the
[49:42] end sign that was was
[49:47] um sent to us from our homeland.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; And um as as the banner, the end sign
[49:57] was lifted up there in Auajima
[50:01] for for those um
[50:05] as they were they were in the middle of
[50:08] a very fierce battle. thousands and
[50:11] thousands had given their life and um
[50:14] and there were going to be um and and
[50:18] and they were still going to be in the
[50:20] war. But this battle was very strategic.
[50:24] It was a very strategic battle and it
[50:26] would um and and there as they they
[50:31] fought um u as I say thousands died
[50:35] within a couple of days as they were
[50:37] trying to uh conquer Auima
[50:41] and and and as they got to the highest
[50:44] point of that island they um they lifted
[50:48] up they hoisted up the flag and that
[50:51] flag the picture of that flag went
[50:54] around the world and it gave courage to
[50:58] the Americans even at home. Amen. The
[51:01] the brave men and women that were or the
[51:05] brave men that were fighting in that
[51:07] battle and um Amen. It gave courage. It
[51:11] it that and that that was a that was an
[51:14] emblem of America that was they were
[51:17] stating that that we we have taken this
[51:21] hill and we will take the battle. Yeah,
[51:23] &gt;&gt; we will we will win the war. And and how
[51:27] that Jesus it was Amen. Jesus came amen
[51:32] to this country came to came to earth.
[51:36] Amen. To redeem me and you. and that
[51:40] that cross will ever more be an emblem
[51:44] of that heavenly country as God has
[51:48] declared,
[51:50] I have purchased. I have won the war. I
[51:54] have now there's going to be [snorts]
[51:57] many more battles. There's going to be
[52:00] many more soldiers that go down, if you
[52:03] will. Amen. They're going to die
[52:05] throughout the ages, but the emblem is
[52:08] still there. And Sister Keys, if you
[52:10] wouldn't mind just just putting that
[52:11] flag back up uh of of Auima and and that
[52:16] this this here, Amen. would become an
[52:19] incredible um uh emblem of the of the uh
[52:25] of of victory for the United States. And
[52:31] &gt;&gt; the photographer there would become a
[52:33] very famous man with that picture. And
[52:36] here the men are in in the in the rubble
[52:39] and and the wars been going on there. I
[52:42] mean, there's there's there's thousands,
[52:44] they say six um I I believe I believe at
[52:47] up to that point there were 6,000
[52:50] uh Japanese killed in that in that that
[52:54] two-day period. And and if I'm
[52:56] remembering right, 2,000 American
[52:59] soldiers had been killed in that in that
[53:01] period of time. But and but they they
[53:04] their their their
[53:06] uh tenacity, their um their vigor, they
[53:10] they they wanted to claim that heel
[53:14] &gt;&gt; and that would become a a focal point.
[53:18] That would become a rallying point for
[53:21] the rest. And the morale of the soldiers
[53:24] would say we can continue to fight. Then
[53:27] we then we find if you wouldn't mind
[53:29] putting the cross up there. And then
[53:31] this one here has ever more been a a an
[53:35] emblem for you and for me.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; That is that is forever more an emblem
[53:41] from our home country telling the
[53:43] soldiers, you must fight.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; You must fight. Amen. This Christ here
[53:51] has paid the price. Keep on pressing on
[53:54] because the day is coming where he's
[53:56] going to call all of his people home.
[53:59] He's going to call all of his soldiers
[54:01] home.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; And so today, amen, as as I continue
[54:06] maybe, Amen. uh under the banner or the
[54:10] in sign the the emblem that God has
[54:14] sent. I am I I want us to look at it
[54:18] from the the groom and the bride and how
[54:21] that
[54:23] how that there is God has promised that
[54:26] there would be a a a bride that he was
[54:30] going to pull out of the peoples of the
[54:33] earth, the denominations of the earth.
[54:35] and he would he would bring a bride into
[54:39] maturity
[54:41] and and there and it's going to look
[54:43] like uh uh many times a hopeless case
[54:47] many times even even in ourselves today
[54:50] as the as as as the bride of Jesus
[54:53] Christ that we believe amen is coming in
[54:56] this generation Jesus is coming to take
[54:59] us home and our emblem is still ever
[55:02] more the cross
[55:03] &gt;&gt; it was the bloody bleed ing word there
[55:06] on Calvary that would forever more.
[55:10] Amen. Uh uh uh it it'd be healing to the
[55:15] wounded. It would be forgiveness to
[55:17] their sins. It would be [applause]
[55:19] forever more. It would be God's grace to
[55:23] his people as as he brings us home. Can
[55:27] you say amen?
[55:29] This bride when we talk about the bride
[55:32] age it means that the bride has come of
[55:35] age that she has been given
[55:37] righteousness.
[55:39] Amen. Her faith has come. When we talk
[55:43] about THE BRIDE IT'S HER faith has come
[55:46] to maturity and to completeness. She has
[55:50] heard the complete interpretation of the
[55:52] word. and and and so and I and I want to
[55:55] say we're not living in a partial
[55:57] revelation. We're living in the complete
[56:01] revelation of God. Now, this is
[56:03] important because up to this age, amen,
[56:06] the church has lived in in in a in a
[56:10] partial revelation. There were still
[56:12] symbols. There were there there were
[56:15] still many things of the of the Bible
[56:18] that were still held under under uh a
[56:22] veil. Amen. It was not a complete
[56:26] revelation. Now, we've had the Bible,
[56:29] but as long as it is in mystery form, as
[56:32] long as it is in symbol form, THEN OUR
[56:35] FAITH COULD NOT come to its completion.
[56:38] And without faith coming to its
[56:40] maturity, there cannot be a a a
[56:46] righteous or a matured bride. Amen. That
[56:50] God has called to do us to be. Can you
[56:53] say amen?
[56:54] &gt;&gt; So it required a perfect word. AMEN. TO
[56:59] BRING OUR FAITH past Baptist, past
[57:02] Methodist, past Pentecost into a
[57:06] completion that can believe God for
[57:08] anything.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And so we so we we want us to look at
[57:14] that here this morning. And I want us to
[57:16] say the bride is not looking at herself.
[57:20] The bride is not looking at at at at her
[57:23] weaknesses. The bride is not looking at
[57:26] her accomplishments. The bride is coming
[57:30] into a revelation that it is all Christ
[57:35] and Christ alone.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; I believe that is the greatest sign of
[57:39] maturity is I cannot do it.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; I must have his grace in my life.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that the great the
[57:50] the the closer we the the closer WE COME
[57:53] INTO THIS revelation Amen. our haltiness
[57:57] begins to to fade away and our humility
[58:01] and our complete reliance upon him in
[58:05] saying I want to please you Lord. I want
[58:09] your blessings upon me. Can you say
[58:12] amen?
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a partial word it it could only
[58:19] bring an underdeveloped bride. Only an
[58:23] UNDER THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALL A PARTIAL
[58:25] WORD COULD BRING. AMEN. IS AN
[58:27] UNDERDEVELOPED BRIDE. THAT
[58:29] underdeveloped means not fully
[58:32] developed. In photography it would mean
[58:35] not developed sufficiently to give a
[58:38] normal image. So the image of of of the
[58:42] word the IMAGE OF OF CHRIST IN THE BRIDE
[58:46] WAS NOT in its fullness. Amen. Because
[58:49] it was underdeveloped.
[58:51] BUT WHEN THE FULLNESS OF THE word would
[58:54] COME OR WHEN GOD REMOVES THE VEIL AND
[58:57] the mysteries of the symbols are are are
[59:00] are set are are open to us, then we can
[59:04] see the finality. Amen. What God has
[59:07] been doing and what he is doing. Brother
[59:10] Brandham would say, Amen. 1 Corinthians
[59:12] 13, he he would he would read this
[59:14] scripture when that which is perfect has
[59:17] come, THAT WHICH IS IN PART SHALL BE
[59:20] DONE AWAY WITH.
[59:22] So all these little things of jumping up
[59:25] and down like a kid and trying to talk
[59:28] in tongues and all these other things
[59:30] WHEN THAT WHICH IS PERFECT we do have
[59:34] and we do have today by God's help the
[59:37] perfect interpretation of the word with
[59:40] divine inter uh divine in vindication
[59:44] then that which is in part is done away
[59:47] with. When I was a child, I spake as a
[59:49] child. I understood as a child, but when
[59:51] I become a man, I put away childish
[59:54] things. Amen. So, so we would say we
[59:57] would that doesn't mean that that that
[1:00:00] the that tongues and and and
[1:00:02] interpretation and visions are are done
[1:00:05] away with. It is that there IS A
[1:00:09] MATURITY THAT has taken PLACE AND THAT
[1:00:12] BRIDE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS DONE.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Not none of this trying to make it
[1:00:18] happen. None of this trying to speak in
[1:00:20] tongues. None of this trying to bring
[1:00:22] the presence of God. We understand his
[1:00:25] word is the only source FOR VICTORY. HIS
[1:00:30] WORD IS THE ONLY SOURCE. AMEN. For
[1:00:34] overcoming.
[1:00:35] That's right. AMEN. BUT AGAIN, IT'S NOT
[1:00:38] A MENTAL CONCEPTION. It is a divine
[1:00:41] revelation within her.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, bless the name of the Lord.
[1:00:46] Amen. It it is it is saying that the
[1:00:48] little girl has come of age and she is
[1:00:52] now responsible for for she she's now
[1:00:55] ready for responsibility.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. All things are set in order for
[1:01:00] THOSE IN THE BRIDE will do only his
[1:01:03] will. No one can make them do otherwise.
[1:01:06] They have thus sayaith the Lord or they
[1:01:09] keep still.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] WE KNOW THAT GOD HAS THAT IT HAS TO BE
[1:01:15] GOD in them doing the work. Amen. Let me
[1:01:18] say it and read it again. THEY KNOW THAT
[1:01:20] IT HAS TO BE GOD in them doing the
[1:01:23] works, fulfilling his word. He did not
[1:01:26] complete all things while on his earthly
[1:01:28] ministry. So now he works in and through
[1:01:34] the bride.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; She knows that. For it was not yet time
[1:01:38] for him to do certain things that he
[1:01:40] must now do. BUT HE WILL NOW FULFILL
[1:01:44] THROUGH THE bride that work which we
[1:01:46] which he left for this specific time.
[1:01:49] Can you SAY AMEN? SO THE BRIDE IS
[1:01:51] COMING. WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING? WE'RE NOT
[1:01:53] FIGHTING A A A war of a man of uh uh you
[1:02:00] know trying to to do something for God.
[1:02:04] WE ARE FIGHTING UNDER THAT BANNER.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; We're fighting UNDER THE BANNER OF THAT
[1:02:10] bleeding word.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE FIGHTING UNDER THAT BANNER.
[1:02:16] A PARTIAL WORD IN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT,
[1:02:19] A PARTIAL WORD COULD ONLY GIVE A
[1:02:22] SUBSTITUTE LAMB,
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; A A PARTIAL WORD. AMEN. BUT IT WAS IN
[1:02:27] THE FULLNESS of time WHEN THE WORD WAS
[1:02:31] COMING TO ITS completion is when Amen.
[1:02:35] the word OF GOD IS IS WHEN THE LAMB OF
[1:02:39] GOD COME IN. WELL, praise the Lord.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; There have been thousands and thousands
[1:02:44] and thousands of of lambs that were
[1:02:46] killed for atonement all through since
[1:02:49] since the the fall of ADAM AND EVE UP
[1:02:52] UNTIL Christ had come. THE OLD TESTAMENT
[1:02:55] believer uh uh UH WAS WAS ACCEPTED BY
[1:02:58] GOD THROUGH THOSE LAMBS. AMEN. It was
[1:03:01] not the perfect plan or it was not the
[1:03:06] perfect word, but it was BRINGING THEM
[1:03:10] AS A SUBSTITUTE TO A COMPLETION UNTIL
[1:03:14] THE PERFECT SON OF GOD WOULD COME AND
[1:03:18] LAY DOWN HIS LIFE TO REDEEM A BRIDE.
[1:03:22] NOW I want you TO CATCH THAT. THIS
[1:03:25] PARTIAL WORD, there was a little bit
[1:03:27] from this prophet and this prophet and
[1:03:30] THIS PROPHET. THE PARTIAL WORD COULD
[1:03:33] ONLY PROVIDE A SUBSTITUTE.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Now it rolled the sin ahead from year to
[1:03:42] year since it could not remit sin. But
[1:03:45] the Old Testament saints were looking to
[1:03:50] that perfect redeemer that was to come.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOING TO BE GOD living in a body
[1:03:58] again here on the earth.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE WHAT HAD FALLEN
[1:04:04] IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. And it would be
[1:04:07] in the it would be in the body of a
[1:04:10] human being, a son of God, right here on
[1:04:14] planet Earth. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; In the middle of Satan's Eden, Amen. IN
[1:04:19] THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF SIN AND CHAOS, God
[1:04:23] would raise up a man AND GOD WOULD SO BE
[1:04:26] PLEASED WITH THAT BODY. AMEN. THAT WHEN
[1:04:30] JESUS DIED, HE WOULD BECOME GOD'S
[1:04:34] PERFECT LAMB.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; He would be the perfect lamb.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; And and and that that complete that
[1:04:41] body, that word, AMEN. HANGING ON
[1:04:45] CALVARY, HANGING ON THE CROSS. THAT'S
[1:04:47] NOT JUST AN ORDINARY MAN there now.
[1:04:50] That's not just an ORDINARY HUMAN. THAT
[1:04:53] WAS [screaming] GOD'S COMPLETION. IT WAS
[1:04:55] ALL OF THE COMPLETION OF PROPHECY IN THE
[1:04:59] BODY OF A MAN.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [applause]
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MAKES THAT PICTURE SO
[1:05:05] INCREDIBLE.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; NO MAN COULD DO THAT.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; NO HUMAN BEING COULD PROVIDE. AMEN. BUT
[1:05:14] BECAUSE IT WAS THE completion of God's
[1:05:17] word, IT WAS THE COMPLETE GOD'S
[1:05:20] [screaming]
[1:05:21] GREAT PLAN OF REDEMPTION WAS UNFOLDED in
[1:05:26] that man hanging on Calvary.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; That that great man would become an
[1:05:34] emblem
[1:05:35] forever more of mercy,
[1:05:38] forgiveness,
[1:05:40] healing. Well, can you say amen? Amen.
[1:05:44] Now, it is in that time, and I want you
[1:05:46] to just stick with me here for a moment
[1:05:48] because I'm referring to this Old
[1:05:50] Testament, in order for you to
[1:05:52] understand where you're at today. As
[1:05:54] we're going through this, I want you to
[1:05:55] also say, I want you to look as there
[1:05:57] was a completion, there was 4,000 years,
[1:06:01] amen, from from Adam till the time that
[1:06:03] Christ came and all of this other Amen.
[1:06:07] There was just pieces of the puzzle
[1:06:09] coming together. pieces of the puzzle
[1:06:12] until it was all revealed in body form
[1:06:16] IN THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; NOW, I want you to as I'm teaching this,
[1:06:22] I want you to also catch this that there
[1:06:24] has also been a amen something in THE
[1:06:27] MAKING. THE BRIDE STARTED OUT UNDER THE
[1:06:30] the the son of man ministry. The same
[1:06:33] ministry that Jesus had was in that
[1:06:36] early church. BUT SOMEHOW [screaming]
[1:06:39] SOMEWHERE THEY LEFT THEIR FIRST LOVE AND
[1:06:42] SHE FELL AGAIN. AND SO GOD HAS BEEN
[1:06:46] LITTLE BY LITTLE HERE'S BEEN THIS
[1:06:48] DENOMINATION and that denomination and
[1:06:50] this and and BUT IT'S BEEN SLOWLY BUT
[1:06:52] SURELY BRINGING US [screaming] OUT AND
[1:06:54] TO A COMPLETION AGAIN. AND GOD IS
[1:06:58] HALLELUJAH. It's got we she's got a he's
[1:07:01] got a bride without spot, wrinkle or
[1:07:03] blemish. [applause]
[1:07:05] Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; And he to her is like an apple tree in
[1:07:11] the desert. And she to him, Amen. He uh
[1:07:16] uh uh uh you know, Lily, he he's looking
[1:07:19] at her. Amen. As as the fairest AMONG
[1:07:23] ALL OF THE DAUGHTERS, there is a love
[1:07:26] relationship. GOD'S WORD IS NOW COMING
[1:07:30] IN COMPLETION IN the woman that he has
[1:07:32] redeemed. Am I making sense?
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Now, now I I I hope this makes sense
[1:07:38] because Jesus WAS WAS COMING. GOD
[1:07:42] [screaming] WAS REVEALING HIMSELF. NOW,
[1:07:45] I want you to catch this in indictment.
[1:07:48] The prophet would tell us, he said, "Now
[1:07:51] notice how appropriate was now showing
[1:07:54] that Jerusalem was ceasing when it was
[1:07:57] in effect until that hour, the
[1:07:59] crucifixion." He says the the blood of
[1:08:02] the lamb was all right until that day.
[1:08:06] But now at the crucifixion, it changes.
[1:08:10] The old system is done.
[1:08:14] There is a new one. And the lamb was at
[1:08:17] the sacrifice. The lamb, the sacrificial
[1:08:20] LAMB WAS ON THE GROUNDS. They were
[1:08:22] condemning and doing the very thing they
[1:08:26] had to do. That's right. Amen. Then he
[1:08:29] looks to you and he says, "God be
[1:08:31] blessed for seeing this wonderful
[1:08:33] heavenly life in this last day." Because
[1:08:37] the churches are doing the same thing
[1:08:40] today until the hour that organization
[1:08:43] religion is condemned and proved to be
[1:08:46] sacrificing Christ's word. And from then
[1:08:50] on comes the word and the word only.
[1:08:54] From the pascal lamb passed away. AMEN.
[1:08:57] CHRIST BECOME our lamb at the day of
[1:09:00] crucifixion and the day THAT THE
[1:09:02] DENOMINATION HAS CRUCIFIED THE word of
[1:09:05] God and accepted a creed in thestead of
[1:09:08] the word that's the day the word comes
[1:09:11] into full effect and that's just been
[1:09:14] recently so brother Bradam IS TRYING TO
[1:09:16] SHOW us here that the bride there had to
[1:09:20] be a crucifixion then of that perfect
[1:09:23] word and there has to be a crucifixion
[1:09:25] today of that perfect word.
[1:09:29] Now, the animal blood atoned up until
[1:09:32] Jesus crucifixion.
[1:09:35] After that, Amen. After the crucifixion,
[1:09:39] things had changed. Amen. No man was
[1:09:42] ever accepted. Uh but using the old
[1:09:45] lamb, none of that. They they couldn't
[1:09:47] take the woolly lamb anymore and bring
[1:09:48] him up and and they could say, "Well, I
[1:09:51] I I'm doing it the way that Abraham,
[1:09:52] Isaac, and Jacob done it." They could
[1:09:54] say, "Well, well, Moses said to do it
[1:09:57] this way." Amen. You mean to tell me
[1:10:00] THAT MOSES WAY DOESN'T work anymore,
[1:10:02] right? They could say all of these
[1:10:04] things, but the word HAD COME TO ITS
[1:10:08] FULLNESS. What is its fullness? And the
[1:10:10] Bible says, "In the fullness of time,
[1:10:13] God sent forth his son made of a woman."
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? SO THE OLD SYSTEM OF
[1:10:21] PARTIAL WORD WAS NO LONGER ACCEPTED.
[1:10:25] WHY? BECAUSE JESUS WAS THE COMPLETE
[1:10:29] WORD.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS THE FULLNESS. HE COULD STAND
[1:10:35] THERE AND SAY, "SEARCH the scriptures
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; for they declare who I am."
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's good. Now today, God is still in
[1:10:45] his word in his bride.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; I want you to just catch that as we as
[1:10:53] we go along. You see, the Holy Ghost was
[1:10:56] given in portion to those Old Testament
[1:10:58] prophets. Amen. They were moved upon by
[1:11:01] the Holy Ghost. All the prophets of the
[1:11:03] Old Testament. Amen. It was the spirit
[1:11:05] by portion on those prophets. Amen. But
[1:11:10] you see, John was told though the one
[1:11:14] that you see the spirit descends upon
[1:11:18] and stays upon, that's going to be the
[1:11:22] lamb of God.
[1:11:25] And then John would say on that one day,
[1:11:27] he would say, UH, UH, BEHOLD THE LAMB OF
[1:11:31] God which takes away the sin of the
[1:11:34] world. They could not EVER GO BACK
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; ON
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; to that old woolly land.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the veil was totally
[1:11:46] rent. There was the veil was rent. There
[1:11:51] was no u uh there they were. They were
[1:11:54] in there sacrificing their human l or
[1:11:57] their their their their woolly lambs.
[1:11:59] They were in there sacrificing the lambs
[1:12:01] the same time that Jesus was hanging on
[1:12:03] Calvary.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Jesus was hanging on
[1:12:06] Calvary the same time that they were
[1:12:08] offering their lambs just like just like
[1:12:10] all of their fathers had done. Moses had
[1:12:12] commanded that Abraham offered a lamb.
[1:12:15] All of these had offered lamb. They are
[1:12:17] doing it according to what was told them
[1:12:21] taught them of the past.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; But they DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THAT WAS
[1:12:26] ALL IN TYPES AND SHADOWS UNTIL THE REAL
[1:12:28] CAME.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; SO THEY WANTED TO CONTINUE ON. AND THE
[1:12:32] BIBLE says there there were the sacred
[1:12:35] priest walking in behind the veil that
[1:12:38] no one else was. No one had ever seen
[1:12:40] behind that veil except for the high
[1:12:42] priest. No one had ever walked in there.
[1:12:46] And the Bible says while they were doing
[1:12:48] that, Jesus was up there crying. And
[1:12:50] when he said, "It is finished,"
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; the veil rent in that temple from top to
[1:12:57] bottom. Yeah.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; And here THE HUMAN PRIEST STANDING THERE
[1:13:02] EXPOSED.
[1:13:04] And there the ark of the covenant, the
[1:13:07] mercy seat was there exposed before all
[1:13:10] the people. The people were gasping.
[1:13:14] No one had ever seen the the mercy seat.
[1:13:16] No one has ever Hallelujah. Come on.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD SAYING THAT THE MERCY SEAT IS
[1:13:24] NO longer in a temple BEHIND A VEIL. THE
[1:13:30] MERCY SEAT IS IN A HUMAN BODY.
[1:13:34] [screaming] JESUS CHRIST THAT WAS DYING
[1:13:37] ON CALVARY.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; The people couldn't understand that.
[1:13:42] They could not accept THAT GOD RESIDED
[1:13:46] IN THAT HUMAN TABERNACLE.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:49] Think about it.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; You catching me?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; The people today have made Christianity
[1:13:58] a religious format.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; They're just a religious thing. Going to
[1:14:04] church. And these days, they've got to
[1:14:07] doctor it up a little bit because, man,
[1:14:09] going to church is pretty boring. Amen.
[1:14:11] And so we got to have light shows and we
[1:14:13] got to we got to paint the stage every
[1:14:16] other month and we got to do we got to
[1:14:18] do everything we can to keep the people
[1:14:21] wanting to come back to church
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; and that's see they miss it
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; right
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; now now Jesus now now brother Brandon I
[1:14:29] want I want to I I well let let me just
[1:14:32] go on here. Amen. Yes there was still
[1:14:34] mercy. There was still mercy. There was
[1:14:37] still blood. But it was not in the old
[1:14:38] system. It was now in Jesus Christ. Yes,
[1:14:44] there was mercy. God's provided place of
[1:14:47] worship was now in Christ. So, Brother
[1:14:49] Brandon would say when that veil rent at
[1:14:51] Calvary, the mercy seat came into plain
[1:14:53] view, what happened? It was hanging on
[1:14:55] Calvary dripping in blood. As they had
[1:14:59] took the blood year after year at the
[1:15:01] cleansing of the sanctuary and the
[1:15:03] sprinkling of the mercy seat there, GOD
[1:15:05] WITH HIS GREAT MIGHTY stroke of
[1:15:07] lightning power split the old badger
[1:15:10] veil from top to bottom and the mercy
[1:15:13] seat came into plain view. The real
[1:15:17] genuine lamb of God was hanging in plain
[1:15:21] view on Calvary. That's the real mercy
[1:15:24] seat. When God had paid the price
[1:15:26] himself and become one of us and had
[1:15:29] manifested himself as a man to get
[1:15:31] acquainted with us and we acquainted
[1:15:33] with him, the mercy seat was in plain
[1:15:36] view of all Israel on that day of
[1:15:38] atonement. Oh, can you say amen?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; That day that day the the scripture says
[1:15:44] that the that that that the uh uh he
[1:15:48] cried out, "It is finished." When Jesus
[1:15:51] rose from the dead, the Old Testament
[1:15:54] saints rose up with him because he truly
[1:15:58] was that word that come to perfection
[1:16:03] for them. Now, now, now I again now get
[1:16:06] and now get this. Did not the scripture
[1:16:09] say that the they without us cannot come
[1:16:14] into completion or perfection?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Just as that word in Jesus had to come
[1:16:20] in its completion in order for all of
[1:16:22] those Old Testament saints, there is a
[1:16:25] bride that has got to come into her
[1:16:28] completion.
[1:16:30] They without us cannot be made perfect.
[1:16:33] Right.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I I I don't I now
[1:16:40] I Hey, I've been hunting all week and so
[1:16:43] uh uh I may be a little bit tired, but
[1:16:45] I'm wanting to get my point to y'all
[1:16:46] here this morning and I hopefully I'll
[1:16:48] do a good job. Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:16:50] Amen. You can still hunt and and and
[1:16:53] study and and uh but I've been getting
[1:16:55] up at 2:30 every morning. A every
[1:16:59] morning. We've got up at 2:30 for a
[1:17:01] whole week. Amen, guys. And uh uh and we
[1:17:05] and we hunted all day long. Praise the
[1:17:06] Lord. But uh you know uh uh but but what
[1:17:10] I what I AM WANT I WANT TO CAPITALIZE ON
[1:17:13] THAT THAT THAT ATONEMENT THAT FLAG THAT
[1:17:15] THAT CALL THAT THAT GOD had had given
[1:17:20] us. Amen. And
[1:17:23] this this message
[1:17:26] is not a banner of
[1:17:29] of religion. This message was God's
[1:17:35] banner of of completion.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; When when when Jesus says it IS
[1:17:42] FINISHED, IT IS ALSO BEEN CRIED THE SAME
[1:17:45] in our day.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Time shall be no more.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Now catch the the similarities of the
[1:17:54] Old Testament. IN THE FULLNESS of time,
[1:17:59] GOD'S SON CAME BORN OF A WOMAN. HE
[1:18:02] CRIED, "IT is finished." At the end of
[1:18:06] the church age, COMING THROUGH THE SEVEN
[1:18:08] CHURCH AGES, THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE A
[1:18:12] COMPLETION WHERE THE SON OF MAN COMES IN
[1:18:15] A body [screaming]
[1:18:16] and declares, "Time shall be no more."
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, no more delay.
[1:18:25] The completion is coming. The completion
[1:18:27] is coming. The flag, the emblem has been
[1:18:32] raised.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Saying the time of end is growing near.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not delaying this anymore.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; I I'm not going to put this in in in
[1:18:44] symbol form anymore. I'm not going TO
[1:18:46] I'M GOING TO OPEN IT ALL [screaming] UP.
[1:18:50] THE VEIL THAT HAS BEEN OVER YOUR EYES
[1:18:53] THROUGHOUT [screaming] ALL OF THESE
[1:18:54] AGES. THESE SEVEN AGES OF
[1:18:56] DENOMINATIONALISM. SEVEN AGES OF MAMA
[1:18:59] SAID AND DADDY SAID AND DOCTOR SAID AND
[1:19:00] THIS ONE SAID THE SEVEN AGES OF OF OF OF
[1:19:04] THIS SEMINARY VERSUS THIS SEMINARY AND
[1:19:06] THAT DENOMINATION VERSUS THAT
[1:19:07] DENOMINATION. IN THE IN THE IN THE
[1:19:10] FINALITY [screaming]
[1:19:10] OF IT ALL, GOD SENDS US A MESSAGE. GOD
[1:19:13] SENDS US HIS WORD. IT'S THE WORD COMING
[1:19:16] OF CHRIST THAT SAYS TIME [screaming]
[1:19:18] SHALL BE NO MORE.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a completion of that
[1:19:24] word
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; in you.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; For there has come.
[1:19:33] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:19:36] Now,
[1:19:38] when God
[1:19:40] God began to brood over that after the
[1:19:43] fall, he brought up an Enoch. He brought
[1:19:46] up an Elijah. He brought up a Moses. He
[1:19:48] brought up a prophet after prophet
[1:19:50] trying to restore that image again.
[1:19:52] Finally, upon the earth came the genuine
[1:19:54] image
[1:19:56] again. Finally
[1:19:58] in the image of God himself again which
[1:20:02] was God the logos made flesh and dwelt
[1:20:04] among us. And now that same logos has a
[1:20:08] part. He's got a pride. The same logos
[1:20:11] the word cannot be tampered with is
[1:20:13] brooding over the churches today trying
[1:20:17] to bring back the word to its full
[1:20:19] manifestation which the prophets car was
[1:20:22] carriers of that seed. The church
[1:20:24] denominations has been carriers to that
[1:20:26] seed. Now, now notice quickly, but like
[1:20:29] the shuck, it hugs, it holds on the seed
[1:20:32] now. Then it leaves her. And Jesus was
[1:20:35] God. His father was the great logos
[1:20:37] itself. And he could not pour it in in
[1:20:40] in it all in Moses. Amen. For he was a
[1:20:43] prophet. The word of the Lord always,
[1:20:46] never fails. Comes to that prophet. No
[1:20:48] place, no time in the Bible since the
[1:20:50] Bible that the correct interpretation of
[1:20:52] the word comes to a theologian. it it's
[1:20:54] not in the scriptures. See, neither
[1:20:56] never did the Pharisees or the
[1:20:58] Sadducees, never did God raise uh never
[1:21:01] did God raise a prophet out any of them.
[1:21:03] Never does he do it in the last days.
[1:21:05] Amen. Another place he says the sun
[1:21:08] comes across and ripens the grain. It
[1:21:10] can't ripen it all at once. It goes on
[1:21:12] to maturing constantly ripens it until
[1:21:14] it comes to a full ear. So is it with
[1:21:17] the church today. It started in his
[1:21:20] infasy back in the dark age where it was
[1:21:22] under the ground and now it's and it's
[1:21:25] growed now in to maturity.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Now growing now into maturity.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now it says this book has not
[1:21:36] been revealed until the seven church
[1:21:39] ages, denominational ages has run out.
[1:21:41] There's no more time. [snorts] It's it's
[1:21:44] only revealed after the church ages and
[1:21:45] denominations have run out. And that's
[1:21:48] the reason M thing is is in such a
[1:21:50] scruple tonight. They pick up the
[1:21:52] doctrine. They run off to one side and
[1:21:54] say this is it. Another picks up another
[1:21:56] doctrine runs out to this side and says
[1:21:58] this is it. Each one builds anomination
[1:22:00] under it. Amen. But still in it all all
[1:22:03] of it. You see the confusion. People are
[1:22:05] wondering what's the truth. Are you
[1:22:08] hearing me? Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Now, now I'm going to but but again, as
[1:22:13] we read while ago, but God blessed God
[1:22:16] be blessed for seeing this wonderful
[1:22:18] heavenly light in this last day. The
[1:22:22] churches is doing the same thing until
[1:22:24] the hour that the organization religion
[1:22:26] is condemned and proved to be
[1:22:29] sacrificing Christ's word. But from then
[1:22:32] on comes the word and the word only.
[1:22:37] The pascal lamb passed away and Christ
[1:22:40] become our lamb at the day of
[1:22:41] crucifixion. And the day that the
[1:22:44] denomination crucified the word of God
[1:22:46] and accepted a creed instead of the
[1:22:48] word, that's the day when the word comes
[1:22:51] into full effect. And he's talking about
[1:22:54] you.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:22:59] as we as we look at this
[1:23:02] standing under that banner, Amen.
[1:23:06] standing there under the banner. Now,
[1:23:10] what is he what is he doing? What is the
[1:23:13] groom doing when [clears throat] he's
[1:23:15] calling his wife?
[1:23:17] He's giving her
[1:23:20] he's giving her righteousness. How is he
[1:23:23] giving her righteousness?
[1:23:25] By giving her faith. Did you know that
[1:23:28] the only thing that you cannot add to
[1:23:30] your temple is faith? That's the
[1:23:34] foundation to to to the to to the to the
[1:23:37] statue was faith.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; The only thing
[1:23:42] God supernaturally gives you. So
[1:23:44] righteousness
[1:23:46] is faith.
[1:23:48] Faith comes by hearing. Not
[1:23:52] denomination, not mama, not daddy, not
[1:23:54] preacher, not faith comes from hearing
[1:23:57] the word of God.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; It comes from that. So the word that has
[1:24:02] been given to us in this day
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; is to is to amen to turn in is to equal
[1:24:12] faith. So when you've got perfect word,
[1:24:15] it is to bring about perfect faith.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Now if there's [clears throat] ever a
[1:24:20] time to get out of legalism, this is the
[1:24:22] time.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Because legalism will turn on you.
[1:24:28] It'll turn on you like a bad dog.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; It'll do it. Oh, that bad dog will be
[1:24:34] right there defending you, defending
[1:24:36] you, defending you. But one of these
[1:24:39] days, he's going to turn and eat you.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; He's going to turn and that that bad
[1:24:44] dog, oh, it's after everybody. Amen. And
[1:24:48] it'll all be in the name of God. It'll
[1:24:51] all be in the name of Christianity. But
[1:24:53] you watch, you remember this. The
[1:24:56] accuser of the brethren is the devil.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; That's the accuser of the brethren. And
[1:25:04] when that devil is right there and he's
[1:25:06] wanting to make you more spiritual than
[1:25:08] somebody else, you just you just watch
[1:25:10] this. Brother Brandham TAUGHT US, YOU
[1:25:13] WATCH THAT MAN THAT'S THAT'S GOT A MORE
[1:25:15] PECULIAR REVELATION OR THAT ACTS A
[1:25:17] LITTLE MORE spiritual than everyone else
[1:25:19] because he's got a wrong spirit upon
[1:25:22] him. and at the end will prove what he's
[1:25:25] got.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:25:29] we've seen that. We've seen that in the
[1:25:32] religious circles. The bride [screaming]
[1:25:35] is not relying on her herself or her
[1:25:41] revelations or whatever. She is A PART
[1:25:46] OF THIS GREAT BODY THAT was the one body
[1:25:50] of God. NOW WE ARE THE collective
[1:25:55] body of God
[1:25:58] and he's going to be revealed in that
[1:26:00] collective body. Yes.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Now, why why do I say that
[1:26:06] is because
[1:26:08] only faith is going to bring that about
[1:26:13] as long as there are condemnation in us.
[1:26:17] And condemnation
[1:26:19] I I I want us I want us I want us to
[1:26:21] really look at conviction and
[1:26:22] condemnation. Condemnation is you are
[1:26:24] walking away from the word of God. Amen.
[1:26:27] You're doing things contrary to the word
[1:26:29] of God. Condemnation comes in and and
[1:26:32] and beats you down for that. Conviction,
[1:26:36] on the other hand, tells you you're
[1:26:38] wrong. Amen. And line it up with the
[1:26:41] word of the Lord. And then it it also
[1:26:43] points back to election. It's coming
[1:26:46] back. Listen, this is not who you are.
[1:26:50] You are my bride. Amen. Let's let's get
[1:26:54] bring there's plenty of blood. Wash
[1:26:56] yourself. The bride has made herself
[1:27:01] ready. Condemnation is saying you you
[1:27:04] you are worthless. You never will be
[1:27:06] bride. You never will. You're just you,
[1:27:09] man. Look look look back. You can look
[1:27:10] back these last 30 years and you still
[1:27:12] going into the same old hang-ups. YOU'RE
[1:27:14] STILL DOING THAT'S the old condemnation.
[1:27:16] Conviction. The greater THE WORD, THE
[1:27:20] GREATER THE CONVICTION. THE GREATER THE
[1:27:22] LIGHT, THE GREATER THE THE MORE YOU CAN
[1:27:24] SEE YOURSELF in the image of that
[1:27:27] mirror.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; IF THERE'S NO LIGHT, NO MATTER HOW
[1:27:31] [screaming] HOW GOOD AND PURE THE mirror
[1:27:33] is, IF THERE'S NO LIGHT, YOU CANNOT
[1:27:36] CORRECT YOURSELF.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; BUT AS LIGHT COMES, YOU CAN LOOK IN THAT
[1:27:40] MIRROR AND THEN YOU CAN YOU can comb
[1:27:44] your hair better. You can brush your
[1:27:47] teeth. You can you CAN SEE THE SPOTS ON
[1:27:49] YOUR GARMENTS. [snorts]
[1:27:51] IT'S WITH THE LIGHT, WITH THE
[1:27:54] REVELATION. AND WHAT I'M SAYING HERE
[1:27:57] TODAY, AMEN. WE'RE NOT IN THE PARTIAL
[1:28:00] REVELATION. WE'RE IN THE COMPLETE
[1:28:04] REVELATION.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; NOT TO CONDEMN, BUT TO CONVICT.
[1:28:09] [screaming]
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we walk under conviction,
[1:28:15] now again, legalism
[1:28:18] is is is is a set of things that we've
[1:28:21] got in our mind, the way things can be,
[1:28:22] and will ignore everything else.
[1:28:25] Conviction
[1:28:27] is going to let you see who you are.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:37] Now you remember you remember the the
[1:28:40] five or the 10 cow bride eight cow
[1:28:42] bride. It was I believe it was the eight
[1:28:44] cow bride.
[1:28:49] Now I've told the story. Y'all remember
[1:28:52] the story?
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Do I need to tell the story?
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so
[1:29:00] there was this um there was this
[1:29:06] uh this is a true story and I and I'm
[1:29:08] and I'm I'm repeating this from from
[1:29:10] from memory so I may have a few of my
[1:29:13] facts wrong but majority of it's going
[1:29:15] to be right. The the the story is about
[1:29:20] a a a
[1:29:23] uh there was a man who had a whole house
[1:29:27] of daughters and and um and they were
[1:29:31] man they were some fine fine women and
[1:29:35] and um it was over there in
[1:29:38] one of the African countries and um uh
[1:29:43] so this this u this uh uh you know, one
[1:29:48] by one, these girls were getting married
[1:29:50] off and and and they would bring in a
[1:29:53] you know, they they have their diary,
[1:29:55] the a man that wanted to to to
[1:29:59] marry one of the girls. I mean, he bring
[1:30:01] a chicken or, you know, a couple
[1:30:03] chickens, whatever they could afford.
[1:30:04] they could bring a a cow or uh bring
[1:30:08] something and they'd give it to the
[1:30:09] father as a diary and in in exchange for
[1:30:13] his for his daughter and he would give
[1:30:16] away, you know, give give his daughter
[1:30:18] to to be married. But there was this one
[1:30:21] this this one uh man he had uh he had
[1:30:24] this one girl that just she was just so
[1:30:31] ugly
[1:30:33] and untidied and and um very very
[1:30:38] backward. He would not I mean she when
[1:30:41] you when you when you seen her she she
[1:30:44] very seldom went went went out in public
[1:30:45] and when she did she kept her head down.
[1:30:48] and her hair was all she she just didn't
[1:30:50] take care of herself and it just and um
[1:30:54] uh just very shy and just oh my complex
[1:30:58] after complex after complex and and so
[1:31:02] um and and everyone pastor up. But but
[1:31:07] one day there there come a prince that
[1:31:11] had that had come through the the
[1:31:13] community that through this this this
[1:31:16] township and and and he and he noticed
[1:31:19] this girl. And there's something about
[1:31:22] that girl that really struck his
[1:31:25] struck his eyes, struck his heart.
[1:31:28] And uh
[1:31:30] he he he caught her one day and was
[1:31:33] talking to her. She just she was just so
[1:31:35] bashful and so and uh uh he says, "You
[1:31:40] know, I'd like to get to know you a
[1:31:41] little bit more." And she she just
[1:31:44] barely look up at him and just, you
[1:31:46] know, and and
[1:31:49] they they they talked a little bit and
[1:31:51] she said, "My, you know, listen, I have
[1:31:54] nothing to give you. My my sisters are
[1:31:57] all pretty. They're all married. They're
[1:31:59] all ve they've married very prominent
[1:32:01] people, but I listen I and u but uh you
[1:32:06] know don't I I I I'd never make a good
[1:32:10] wife. And uh well finally, Amen. He went
[1:32:15] and talked to her daddy
[1:32:17] and he says, "Listen,
[1:32:19] I I like your daughter and I I I'm I'd
[1:32:22] really like her to be my wife."
[1:32:25] And the man says, "Say what?
[1:32:28] You want her to nothing. But I listen.
[1:32:34] You get what you get.
[1:32:38] I mean, she's always been this way. And
[1:32:40] And uh I I I can't guarantee you what.
[1:32:45] And he says, "I love her and I want to
[1:32:48] marry her."
[1:32:51] And uh he he looked at her and he and he
[1:32:56] says and and and I want to give a diary.
[1:32:59] And you know the dad I you know I think
[1:33:01] the the the best he had ever been given
[1:33:03] was two cows and for his other daughters
[1:33:06] I mean he had got as low as just a
[1:33:08] couple of chickens and and uh
[1:33:12] and he says I'm willing to give eight
[1:33:15] cows.
[1:33:18] The man looked at her, looked at him and
[1:33:21] said, "Eight
[1:33:25] cows." No one had ever heard of eight
[1:33:28] cows.
[1:33:31] He says, "Who are you?"
[1:33:38] He said, "I'm the prince
[1:33:41] of the king of of our tribe."
[1:33:44] And and he's sitting there. There he is
[1:33:47] in this lovely little little lonely
[1:33:48] house and he's he said, "And you want my
[1:33:51] daughter?"
[1:33:53] Well,
[1:33:55] he ended up he ended up uh marrying the
[1:33:58] daughter and well
[1:34:01] so that was a good story and that and
[1:34:03] had been heard. Well, this there was
[1:34:05] this this journalist that had heard
[1:34:08] about this and he wanted to know what
[1:34:11] ever happened what ever happened to this
[1:34:14] eight cow bride. And so he had he had
[1:34:17] left. It was either it was either the UK
[1:34:19] or the US the US. I can't remember
[1:34:23] exactly how it went, but they they went
[1:34:24] and found the place and got and found
[1:34:26] the tra and got up and they found they
[1:34:29] they they found the uh he was he was
[1:34:32] asking all around who is this woman?
[1:34:34] Where is she at? Where does And they
[1:34:36] said, "Oh, you'll see her here shortly.
[1:34:38] You'll see her." And they said, "Oh,
[1:34:41] she's you'll know her when you see her."
[1:34:44] And so he was looking for ugly, you
[1:34:46] know. And about that time, here comes
[1:34:48] here comes a a very poised woman walking
[1:34:53] and um and and and all these all these
[1:34:56] others all around her. And as she's
[1:34:58] coming through, they're offering her,
[1:35:00] "You want this kind of fruit?" I mean,
[1:35:02] as she walks in the whole everywhere she
[1:35:04] goes, just demands the attention of
[1:35:06] everybody. And they he goes, "Well,
[1:35:08] who's this woman?"
[1:35:11] He says, "This is the woman
[1:35:14] that you want to see.
[1:35:16] This is our princess.
[1:35:18] He goes, "No, not not that. Not that
[1:35:20] woman. This woman's beautiful." And she
[1:35:23] turned around and looked at him. Her
[1:35:26] hair was so beautiful. Her skin was so
[1:35:29] beautiful. She was dressed. She act as
[1:35:32] elegant a as a prince. And those around
[1:35:35] her were giving her respect.
[1:35:39] And finally he he he got an audience. He
[1:35:42] said, "Can I talk with you?" And the
[1:35:44] woman looked at him kindly and said,
[1:35:46] "Sure." So he introduces himself and
[1:35:49] they begin to talk and she said, "Yes,
[1:35:53] it's all true.
[1:35:58] I had seen myself
[1:36:00] through the eyes of all of my sisters.
[1:36:04] I'd seen their beauty. I'd seen their
[1:36:09] all the boys always come to look after
[1:36:11] them. They never asked me. I I I
[1:36:16] had I I was empty. I had nothing.
[1:36:23] She said, "But the day
[1:36:25] the prince came to my house
[1:36:28] and he offered my daddy
[1:36:32] a cow dowy for me.
[1:36:37] She said something happened.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; I felt value.
[1:36:42] I felt loved.
[1:36:45] He was willing to give eight cows
[1:36:49] for me.
[1:36:52] She says, "When I found that it was a
[1:36:55] real promise," she said, "Something
[1:36:58] welled up on the inside. I started
[1:37:01] fixing myself up and I started and the
[1:37:04] and the prince started delighting in me
[1:37:07] and and started teaching me. Amen. The
[1:37:10] ways of the palace and
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; and the ways of
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; And she says, "Here I am today. I am who
[1:37:17] I am."
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Because of the prince's love
[1:37:22] to me.
[1:37:24] I think of that when I look at when I'm
[1:37:27] still talking about that emblem. I'm
[1:37:29] talking about that banner over me
[1:37:32] is love. His banner, his banner of
[1:37:35] perfection, his banner of mercy, his
[1:37:39] banner, Christ the living word. Christ
[1:37:43] come in this day in THE GREATEST OF ALL.
[1:37:47] HE HIMSELF came
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; and give us a message.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Saying the father's riches are very
[1:37:56] real. The land is very real.
[1:38:02] I'm going to open up the mysteries to
[1:38:04] you. I'm going TO GIVE OF MYSELF. I'M
[1:38:07] GOING TO SHARE that only my country
[1:38:11] knows. Are you hearing me? What does it
[1:38:14] do? It's not in the legalism. NOW THERE
[1:38:19] IS A LOVE THAT IS BEING EXPRESSED BACK
[1:38:23] to him. Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; He loved me.
[1:38:27] When I fail, it grieves me to no end.
[1:38:32] But I know I'm his.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; I know I'm his.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; I know I'm his. Well, can you say amen?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; So, the prophet in the opening of the
[1:38:45] seals, and I'm closing now. The prophet
[1:38:46] in the opening of the seals, Amen. He is
[1:38:50] he he he he is he's expressing something
[1:38:53] in the breach and and and he's he's he's
[1:38:57] talking about he's been an intercessor
[1:38:59] and he's now Mary can't be an
[1:39:00] intercessor then none of these others
[1:39:02] can be intercessors St. Francis St. in a
[1:39:05] none of these can be intercessors.
[1:39:08] He he says, "Amen." John never saw
[1:39:11] thousands of saints come out of the
[1:39:13] minatorial. He saw a lamb come out.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; He saw a lamb come out in this day.
[1:39:19] Amen. And I don't care how many saints
[1:39:21] have been slain. They were all do it.
[1:39:24] Every one of us like the thief on the
[1:39:25] cross. We've sinned. We're do this. But
[1:39:27] this man does nothing. He was he was the
[1:39:30] only man who was worthy. And here he
[1:39:32] come from the intercessory box. What
[1:39:35] what's he coming for now? John was
[1:39:37] weeping.
[1:39:39] What's going to happen? And then said,
[1:39:41] "Don't weep, John." Amen. Here comes the
[1:39:44] lion. And he and the one that has
[1:39:47] prevailed and and he looked and here
[1:39:50] come a lamb that is bloody that had been
[1:39:52] slain. Amen. This this this one that had
[1:39:55] been that had died on Calvary 2,000
[1:39:57] years ago. Amen. He's been interceding
[1:40:00] for every one of us. Are you all
[1:40:02] understanding now? He's been doing it
[1:40:03] for all the seven ages.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; But at the end time,
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; at the end time, the lamb comes forth,
[1:40:13] takes the seals off the book
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; because there is a woman who has come of
[1:40:20] age
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; and he begins to reveal.
[1:40:25] Amen. He says now, he says he comes
[1:40:28] forth with what? To take his claims now.
[1:40:31] Oh my. He comes forth to take his
[1:40:33] claims. Now he had done the kinsman
[1:40:36] work. He had come down, become a man,
[1:40:38] and died. He's done the kinsman work of
[1:40:40] redemption, but had not as of yet called
[1:40:43] for his claim. Now he comes on the scene
[1:40:46] to claim his rights. Amen. For which he
[1:40:51] was slain. For as becoming a kinsman to
[1:40:54] die in his place to redeem him. But the
[1:40:57] elder was right when he called him a
[1:40:59] lion. The elder called him a lion. Said
[1:41:02] a lion because he he had been a lamb, an
[1:41:05] intercessor, a bloody lamb. But now he's
[1:41:07] come forth. His days of intercession is
[1:41:10] over. Let him be filthy that is filthy
[1:41:12] steel. Let him that's righteous be
[1:41:14] righteous still. And and and and he goes
[1:41:17] on down. He says he stepped forth from
[1:41:20] eternity to take the title deed book to
[1:41:22] break the seals and reveal the mysteries
[1:41:25] when at the end time. Can you say amen?
[1:41:29] What's he doing it for?
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; It was then that he says,
[1:41:34] "Oh, come out from underneath the bed.
[1:41:38] Come out. Get you're mine."
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Before it was it was to whosoever will.
[1:41:44] But he's coming so specific in this day.
[1:41:47] And he's saying, "Mary, you're mine.
[1:41:50] Sister Karen, you're mine. Brother
[1:41:52] Steve, you're mine." Amen. Jerene
[1:41:56] Martin, you're mine. It's God. He's
[1:41:59] coming. And what does it do?
[1:42:03] You look around and you think of all the
[1:42:06] denominations,
[1:42:07] of all the great preachers, of all of
[1:42:10] the of all of the famous SINGERS AND
[1:42:13] EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THE LAND, and yet
[1:42:15] God has come down unveiling your worth.
[1:42:18] Right.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Well, John, give us We don't We don't
[1:42:26] need We don't need a reporter to come
[1:42:28] and tell us the end or come and
[1:42:30] interview us later. We don't have to
[1:42:33] even guess.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you were to read that entire
[1:42:36] chapter of Revelations that I just read,
[1:42:38] the Bible says, "All of heaven was
[1:42:40] rejoicing. Oh, they were all shouting
[1:42:43] hallelujah, thunders, and voices of many
[1:42:46] water. They were all screaming, "The
[1:42:48] Lamb and his bride,
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; the Lamb and his bride." And they would
[1:42:54] scream out, "The bride, the Lamb's wife
[1:42:58] has made herself ready."
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? What caused it? It
[1:43:06] was God sending a banner. God sending
[1:43:08] that message to us in this day.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; You look in the mirror.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't want you to look in
[1:43:14] them with your that self-righteous look
[1:43:16] will will will will cause you to
[1:43:18] overlook a whole bunch of self about
[1:43:20] yourself. A whole bunch of stuff that
[1:43:23] that self-righteous look towards this
[1:43:25] one and pious towards that one and
[1:43:27] towards that one. Amen. But when you
[1:43:29] take that all out and you look in the
[1:43:31] mirror of God's word, you say, "Oh, that
[1:43:34] hair's out of place. Oh, I can fix that.
[1:43:36] Oh, I could come on now." And when
[1:43:38] you're doing that, what are you what are
[1:43:40] you doing? Amen. It's God's
[1:43:43] righteousness coming upon us. We're just
[1:43:46] believing his word.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; We're just believing his word.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; And the You say, "BROTHER WENDLE, FAITH
[1:43:53] WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD." THAT'S EXACTLY
[1:43:56] RIGHT. GOD'S GOT TO give you faith.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; The message HAS COME TO GIVE YOU FAITH.
[1:44:03] You can do the works. And that's how
[1:44:05] we've seen that.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:44:07] How many people in our church has come
[1:44:09] through here that were brilliant that
[1:44:10] could memorize the seven church ages and
[1:44:14] the seven seals and they they could
[1:44:16] quote that thing like nobody's business.
[1:44:18] But where are they at today?
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; But when God comes with divine
[1:44:22] revelation to you, it's not in
[1:44:24] memorizing everything.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; It's in accepting it.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; The prince finds value in me.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; The prince finds value in me. Praise the
[1:44:36] Lord. as the musicians come.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, his banner over me. I'm living
[1:44:42] under the banner.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Living under that banner.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Praise that. Is lifted high. It's lifted
[1:44:49] high, folks. It's ran around this world.
[1:44:51] It's it it went around the world seven
[1:44:54] times. G,
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; man,
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; it's lifted high. When you hear a
[1:45:00] preacher preaching it, what that that
[1:45:02] that should make you want to rejoice.
[1:45:04] Oh, his banner over me is love. When you
[1:45:07] read the Bible, you're saying, "Oh, his
[1:45:09] banner over me is love." When when
[1:45:11] you're hearing when you're hearing the
[1:45:13] messenger preach, Amen.
[1:45:16] listening to the message, it's his
[1:45:18] banner over me is divine love.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Divine love. Hallelujah.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; You're not an eight cow bride. Amen.
[1:45:30] You're a give all. He gave everything.
[1:45:34] He gave everything. [music and applause]
[1:45:44] I I like what brother Wayne said one
[1:45:47] time,
[1:45:50] you know, talking about false those
[1:45:52] false teachers is how can [music] they
[1:45:53] even begin to start
[1:45:57] to teach correct
[1:45:59] when they deny the advent of the prophet
[1:46:03] messenger
[1:46:05] that brought
[1:46:08] the spoken word, the original spoken
[1:46:13] When we get that, we understand that
[1:46:15] that was God's divine grace upon us.
[1:46:20] And how thankful I am [music] for that
[1:46:23] divine grace. Hallelujah. Oh, he's so
[1:46:27] wonderful, isn't he?
[1:46:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:40] It just it just makes it makes my
[1:46:42] [music] heart makes my heart to to
[1:46:45] rejoice.
[1:46:47] And um
[1:46:52] you know
[1:46:54] the
[1:47:04] he said after after 2,000 years he's
[1:47:08] sending someone who is so far from
[1:47:09] organization education in the world of
[1:47:11] religion that is John the Baptist and
[1:47:14] Elijah of old.
[1:47:16] He will hear only from God and he will
[1:47:19] have thus sayaith the Lord and speak for
[1:47:21] God. He will be God's mouthpiece
[1:47:25] and he as it is declared in Malachi 4
[1:47:28] and6 will turn
[1:47:30] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:47:34] fathers.
[1:47:35] He will bring back that elect in the
[1:47:38] last days. They will hear a vindicated
[1:47:40] prophet give the exact truth as it was
[1:47:42] with Paul and he will restore that truth
[1:47:45] as they had had it. And those elect with
[1:47:46] him in that day will be the ones who
[1:47:49] truly manifest the Lord and be his body
[1:47:52] and be his voice and perform his works.
[1:47:56] Hallelujah. Do you see it? Now, did you
[1:47:59] did you get that?
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; His manner over me.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; His banner over me.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:06] Amen. He says, if you look back the
[1:48:08] history, he said, man, they they you've
[1:48:10] had all these denominations and
[1:48:11] organizations. They had Luther had it
[1:48:13] for a while and they went then Wesley
[1:48:15] and they took the revelation and then
[1:48:17] Amen. He says he says you know he says
[1:48:20] [music]
[1:48:21] until he says the Methodists have failed
[1:48:23] and God has raised up others and and so
[1:48:26] it has gone on through the years until
[1:48:27] in this last day there is again another
[1:48:30] people in the land.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Who under their messenger will be the
[1:48:34] final voice to the final age. Yes sir.
[1:48:39] Church is no longer the vow of God. It's
[1:48:41] its own mouthpiece.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "God is turning on her and he
[1:48:45] will confound her through the prophet
[1:48:47] and the bride. For the voice of God will
[1:48:50] be in her.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; She's not the average lady. She's not
[1:48:54] the average woman. She's his bride."
[1:49:00] Why did they crucify Jesus? Cuz he said,
[1:49:02] "I and my father are one." And the world
[1:49:06] will despise you for saying, "I am the
[1:49:10] bride of Jesus Christ." They'll despise
[1:49:13] that.
[1:49:15] But God is in his bride.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Someone's got to believe it. They ain't
[1:49:20] going to. You might as well believe it
[1:49:22] about yourself.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; You can't ask someone else to believe
[1:49:24] it.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. But he said that
[1:49:30] he will confound it to the prophet the
[1:49:31] bride. The voice of God will be in her.
[1:49:33] Yes. It says last chapter of Revelations
[1:49:36] verse 17, spirit and the bride say come
[1:49:39] once more the bride the world will hear
[1:49:41] direct from God as at Pentecost. But of
[1:49:43] course the word bride will be repudiated
[1:49:47] as it was in that first age. Can you say
[1:49:50] amen?
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I SAY TODAY LET'S STAND
[1:49:54] UP.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; STAND UP FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS. STAND up for
[1:49:58] truth. Stand up for that which is
[1:49:59] [music] which is glorious.
[1:50:04] You're not a commoner.
[1:50:06] He's made you a princess.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; You're not you're you're not
[1:50:14] you're not you're not one of those that
[1:50:16] Amen. Uh uh that self-proclaimed. No.
[1:50:21] God's come to you. God has has has given
[1:50:24] his his bride that. Can you say amen?
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. Brother Bram talked
[1:50:31] about uh Abraham Lincoln being born for
[1:50:35] such a time as that. [music] Lincoln
[1:50:37] standing out there, you know, he had
[1:50:39] lost he'd lost election after election
[1:50:41] and he had done this and that, man.
[1:50:44] Amen. And there he was. He won the
[1:50:46] election to be president.
[1:50:48] Hallelujah.
[1:50:50] But God had God had raised him up for
[1:50:52] that. And he he comes out off that ship
[1:50:54] there in New Orleans, I believe it was.
[1:50:56] and and uh uh and and and and he and he
[1:51:00] and he looked there and he seen that
[1:51:01] slave pit and he and and and uh he seen
[1:51:05] the auctioneers
[1:51:07] uh auctioning off those slaves. Amen.
[1:51:10] And and and and there they were. [music]
[1:51:13] And and and Abraham Lincoln pitched his
[1:51:16] fist like that and said, "That's wrong.
[1:51:19] And someday I'll hit it if it takes my
[1:51:22] life." Hallelujah. And then brother
[1:51:24] Brandon would say this, and I love this.
[1:51:26] He says, ' Let me tell you, brother,
[1:51:28] unbelief is of the devil and let me hit
[1:51:31] it, Lord. I don't care if it cost me my
[1:51:34] life.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was he doing? He said, just
[1:51:39] as those auctioneers and those slave
[1:51:40] owners, Amen, was doing that to the
[1:51:43] black man, he said, so is unbelief doing
[1:51:46] that to God's elect.
[1:51:48] He said, "Let me hit that thing as hard
[1:51:52] as I can." And I say if that's what God
[1:51:55] has come to drive that unbelief out of
[1:51:58] us, drive it out of us. Drive that
[1:52:00] unbelief out of your mind. Drive it out
[1:52:02] of your heart.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Man, is that right?
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Man, we're under a banner.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; That great banner, that great emblem,
[1:52:18] that great that great uh uh symbol of
[1:52:21] victory. IT'S FOREVER PAID FOR.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; And God sends a prophet in this day
[1:52:28] [music]
[1:52:29] to say, "You're the woman. Maturity has
[1:52:31] come. I'm going to show you why you're
[1:52:33] [music] redeemed and what you're
[1:52:35] redeemed for.
[1:52:40] Greatest battle ever fought." Brother
[1:52:41] Brandham would say, "The great hour of
[1:52:43] charge is at hand."
[1:52:45] Hallelujah. Soldiers
[1:52:48] with armors gleaming, colors streaming,
[1:52:52] faith and doubt is setting yourself in a
[1:52:54] raid in this tabernacle this morning.
[1:52:57] Doubt is on one side, faith is on the
[1:53:00] other. Soldier standed your post of
[1:53:02] duty.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our captain, the morning

[1:58:44] mom.
[1:58:51] [music] I never questioned my dad's
[1:58:52] love.
[1:58:54] Mom and dad loved me.
[1:58:58] You kids should never question your your
[1:59:02] mom and dad's love.
[1:59:04] Even when you're being idiots, you
[1:59:06] should never question your dad's [music]
[1:59:08] love.
[1:59:10] None of it.
[1:59:15] Because children are children.
[1:59:21] But as you begin to grow and mature,
[1:59:23] [music]
[1:59:25] and maturity is not being able to grow a
[1:59:27] mustache,
[1:59:29] that's that's [music] not
[1:59:32] which that's good for some of y'all.
[1:59:39] I remember when I was I was a kid, I was
[1:59:41] I was already growing me a little
[1:59:42] mustache. [music] I was 14 and I was I
[1:59:45] was proud of it. I was shaving already.
[1:59:47] I've been shaving since I was 12. And so
[1:59:49] I'd already got me a little bit of a
[1:59:50] mustache and [music] and uh
[1:59:53] so there's my my buddy. He was he had
[1:59:56] never shaven, but he had a little peach
[1:59:58] fuzz. So we were standing one day and so
[2:00:00] someone was making fun of him. You know,
[2:00:03] man, [music] you need to shave that
[2:00:05] thing that the little peach fuzz off and
[2:00:08] he said, "It took me 14 years to grow
[2:00:11] this."
[2:00:16] Anyways,
[2:00:18] that don't make that don't make [music]
[2:00:20] you mature. But as as you begin to grow,
[2:00:24] you begin to [music] not question mom
[2:00:26] and dad so much and you begin to think,
[2:00:30] you know what,
[2:00:32] they've got a point here
[2:00:35] and then you start asking them to teach
[2:00:36] you.
[2:00:38] Amen. Any of you kids in the teaching
[2:00:40] stage, y'all y'all in your Are you still
[2:00:42] in the My dad's dumb? Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:00:53] And when it comes to us and God, God's
[2:00:56] got a church here that's not
[2:01:00] looking at him as if he's dumb, as if
[2:01:02] his Bible is archaic,
[2:01:05] as if.
[2:01:09] But the bride has come to a point where
[2:01:11] we really love God and love his word and
[2:01:17] love his messenger.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:22] That that is the greatest thing
[2:01:26] and we hold it to our hearts so dear.
[2:01:30] Amen.
[2:01:32] So, as we leave this place today,
[2:01:37] I just say, let's just simply say, Lord,
[2:01:39] I'm going to trust you and believe you
[2:01:43] more than I've ever done it before.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care what my mind is saying.
[2:01:48] [music] I don't care what this does or
[2:01:50] that does. I'm going to cling to that
[2:01:53] word.

[2:02:01] God bless you.

[2:02:06] glad for that banner. Glad for God's
[2:02:09] love. I'm glad to be a part of God's
[2:02:11] body. Amen.

[2:02:15] And Amen. We're we're we're almost home.
[2:02:20] Well, what are we going to sing as we as
[2:02:22] as we get ready to go? Listen, God
[2:02:25] doesn't send that without without a re
[2:02:28] when when when God sends a messenger to
[2:02:32] a generation [music] as he has done in
[2:02:35] this age. Listen, he's it's for a
[2:02:37] reason.
[2:02:39] It's to bring that finality.
[2:02:42] I'm going to wash them with the washing
[2:02:45] of the water by the word. For there is a
[2:02:48] [music] bride that I'm going to open and
[2:02:49] unveil
