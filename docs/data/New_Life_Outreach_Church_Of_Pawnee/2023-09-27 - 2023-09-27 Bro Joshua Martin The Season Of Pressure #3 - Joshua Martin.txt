Waiting [Music] pieces [Music] there was Jesus [Music] there was Jesus [Music] hey man you're thankful for that this evening every step of the way he's been with us amen reminds me of that little poem that brother Branham quoted the footsteps on the sands of time he said Lord you left me there's only one set of footprints there said no I didn't leave you that's when I picked you up and carried you through the hard time and I'm so grateful that he's been with us every step of the way when we didn't feel him he was there when we couldn't see him he was there are you thankful for that amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Psalms 3 and 1. then Galatians 6 and 8. you're gonna have to bear with me tonight I've been struggling with my voice so I I won't keep you alone tonight um I'll just say a few things here try to and try to encourage I'll discontinue you on my thought on pressure and I believe you're living in a great hour of pressure amen the devil's coming every different direction but you look at Psalms three and one a Psalm of David when he fled from Absalom his son Lord how are they increased that troubled me many are they that rise up against me many there be which say of my soul there was no help for him in God but thou O Lord are the shield for me my glory and the lifter of my head I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy heel I laid me down and slept I awaken for the Lord sustained me I would not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about arise O Lord Save Me O God for thou was smitten all my enemies upon the cheekbone thou has broken the teeth of the ungodly salvation belongeth unto the Lord thy blessing is upon thy people Salah the Galatians 6 and 8 and I like how David is putting it he's in a hard time he's surrounded but I Cried unto the Lord with my voice he wasn't ashamed about it but he knew he was in a desperate spot where the pressure was all around him he needed a delivery work and he looked at Galatians 6 and 8 for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he thus soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap Everlasting and let us not be weary in well-doing for a due season we shall reap if we faint not amen can be about our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord I'm going to thank you for your grace and your mercy that you've given us Lord God as we fill your presence here tonight Lord we've sang songs of worship Lord Lord have dedicated the service unto your hands God I ask that you and be in this part of the service Lord You see I've been struggling with my voice I ask that you would help me Lord help my voice to clear up father I ask that you would speak tonight Lord you know the needs of the people father Lord be laid into your hands if you ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated and the Bible says don't get weary in well-doing and I believe all of us can say we've been weary before there's been times where we've taken blow after blow after blow and it just feels like we can't take it anymore where it feels like we're just going to give up but the Apostle Paul would say the messenger of Satan buffets me and the word Buffett is blow after blow after blow and the Bible says the Apostle Paul asked the Lord three times take this away from him deliver me from this and the Lord spoke back to the Apostle Paul and says but my grace is sufficient for thee my weakness your weakness my in your weakness my strength can be displayed and even though he has taken blow after blow after blow God has given him a security that I have not left you there by yourself but I'm going to carry you through this opposition I'm going to carry you through and you see the pressure is out to make you wearing it's out to make you tired it's out to beat you down film and you remember what the Apostle Paul says the fire is going to try every man's work to see what sort it is so even though you're built on the right foundation there's still going to be pressure that is going to come after your building going to come after your life and that is the time that we need somebody to carry us through the Bible says in Proverbs 24 and 10 it felt faint in the day of adversary thy strength is small so he's saying if you get weary in the time of adversity you're not going to have strength to press on and I think mine Lord help us not to get weary and if we are weary there is somebody here that can pick us up oh my so we see what the Bible says that our adversary is the devil and he is roaming two and four seeking whom he may devire and so we're not on this Earth powerless and by yourself but God has given us a strength but we see what the devil is out after you look at Luke 22 and 31 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he might sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith shall not and when thou are converted strengthen thy Brethren so the the Jesus tells us what the devil is after he's willing to sift us and that word sift is to shake and that's what they would do with the wheat is they would beat it down and begin to shake it and then all of the shaft and the husk will begin to fall off and so the Bible is saying that the devil is coming and trying to shake you and he's trying to take the faith out of your life but I like how the Bible puts that but I have prayed for thee that you lose not your faith and now that is an encouraging thought that in the midst of the shaking in the midst of the this discouragement God is for Jesus has already prayed a prayer for us though we keep our faith in the midst of the pressure and I don't believe that he just prayed for Peter but every one of his sons every one of his daughters he has prayed for him that she will that you will press through the opposition and not come out wearing but come out stronger than ever before Oh my Jesus is telling Peter Satan is after you but I prayed that you will keep your faith who am I that you will be separated from your faith because we know if you lose your faith you cannot operate the supernatural God can heal God can deliver God can fill with the Holy Ghost but with thou faith we can never operate the supernatural we can see others be healed we can see others touched but without faith personally for me we can never see the Supernatural and so that's what the devil is after is to take your faith away but Christ has already prayed for us but you notice where the Branham was saying all hell has turned loose and all the guns of hell is pointed out us and that is a dark picture but he says at the same time that all of hell is turned loose all of Heaven is turned loose and so there is a power that in the midst of uncertainty there is something that is keeping us and pushing us forward but the prayer must say in the Lord kindly checked me oh and that's a purpose in my heart then if he would help me that I was going to do different and as just as you start to do something for God then expect all of the guns of Hell to turn right on you see he says just as you start to do something for God then all of hell is going to turn loose on him and so that is a good sign when you're under pressure because that means you're doing something right you can look at the scarecrows I know it's a it's something that we've heard before but a scarecrow ain't in the middle of the desert it ain't in the middle of a pastor but a scarecrow is in the middle of a farm in the middle of something that has a life in it and so if you see a scarecrow you know there is a life somewhere you know there was a sustaining power somewhere so all the pressure is letting you know there's a life on the inside your faith ain't being shaken you ever lost your confidence but you've got life on the inside you might be shaken the devil might be trying to sift you but you've got a security there's an acre a million signs you see the Bible would say in Isaiah 40 and 30. even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall and so trying to trying to go through the pressure in human strength we are never going to make it because the Bible says even the youth is going to be weary that's a natural strength this is a day of weariness everybody's tired you wake up in the morning and you're tired you're eating lunch during the middle of the day you're tired they don't seem like you can get rest because we're constantly tired it's a spirit that is attacking the body of Christ trying to make you weary but that's not just happening in the natural but in the Supernatural the devil's coming with blower after blow after blow trying to make you weary where you can't have faith to believe when you can't have faith to persevere but I say this morning that Christ has already prayed for us that we lose not our faith don't give up don't get weary in well-doing but withstand the pressure there's a victory on the other side of the pressure there's a there's an overcoming power on the other side of the pressure if you can just withstand the pressure the supernatural because we know any time that the Supernatural is close by the devil's going to come and try to pressure you out of it we can look at uh as a Zacchaeus the short man that climb the wall or climb that the climb a tree the Bible says that he desired to see Jesus and so there was a desire there to see the supernatural but the Bible says he could not see him because the Press was too great and so the pressure was trying to keep him away from saying the supernatural the pressure was trying to keep him from seeing a living God but if since there was a desire there he was willing to press and the Bible says that he found a tree he knew that Christ was going to walk by that way so he found he found a position where he knew that Christ was going to combine oh man I think a good position to see Christ is the praise and the worship even when you don't feel like it praise God even when you're tired praise God even when you're weary praise God cause that puts you in a position to see the supernatural Hallelujah and the Bible says that Christ walked by and stop and says Zacchaeus come down for today I will abide I was a will in your house but you notice I know we've talked about this before he the Bible says he was going to abide in Zacchaeus house but he left that day the body of Christ left the house of Zacchaeus but the supernatural was there to remain we might not got the physical body of Jesus Christ dwelling in the church to willing in our homes to well again our lives but the supernatural that we've pressed through to obtain is dwelling in every pressure that it is dwelling in everything that we go through oh my see what happens when you get weary and start to faint it's hard to press on you know if you're if you're out running a marathon or playing sports or hiking in the mountains your legs get tired and your your mind is telling you to press on your mind is saying come on put it in the Foot In Front it take another step but since your legs are so wearing it's hard to put another foot in front or the other but if we can just get a refreshing drink of water or you know I was hiking up in the mountains one time in Arizona and I was wore out and tired but the guy that we was hiking with he packed a bunch of code apples and you know I love Apple Juice I love apples but once I ate that Apple there was a nourishment that come across my body it was something that my body was lacking my mind was telling me to move on but my body could not keep up because I was weary but there was a nourishment that could line my body oh Hallelujah lined my body up with my mind and I'm not talking about uh about a living by the mind but we've got faith inside of a heart that is telling us to move on the pressure I'm not talking about psychology but I'm talking about a supernatural whenever you're lower and you can't move you can't you don't feel like you can take another step there's an ingredient here the shame them the supernatural holy ghost that can come across your life one more time and that your body can obey your confession the sure body can obey the faith that is telling you to keep on hey the same time they give up they say take time to to give in and play dead this is time to March this is the time to go on we're at the end time this is the time for a rapturing generation this is the time to see your loved ones to see your body change the same time they give up but we need something to push us in that direction when we are wearing hey it's okay to get weary it's natural to get weary but but we can't stay in that state we gotta look for a solution hey you see too many people try to find something in natural resources when they're weary spiritually you know the Bible says now David says I looked you where my help comes from I look to the mountains where my help comes from he knew the one that anointed him the one that called him to be a king was the one he needed to fight when he was weary come on somebody you didn't Place yourself here you didn't call yourself to be here you're not here by accident but it was God that chose you to be here it was God that elected you to be here so whenever you are wearing sports ain't gonna lift you up when you are wearing love relationships ain't going to lift you up but you need the one that called you to come by your way up and lift you out of their weary shape hallelujah holy God can lift you up oh my David is saying I'm looking to the one that called me and placed me here that's where we need to put her eyes not on the things of the world not on emotions but I'm looking to the one that placed me here in the first place oh my you're seeing he's wanting you to get weary you can be a good boxer you can be strong and you can be fast but if you don't got endurance the other boxer is just going to wear you out if he's got more endurance than him he's just going to come at you and come at you and come at you and he may get hit once or twice but his endurance is pushing past your endurance your endurance and one dime there's gonna come a time where your strength is going to fail your speed is going to fail if he's got more endurance than you and I thought mine here we are we can we can be on fire with the things of God we can get the Holy Ghost and we're doing great but the devil's been on earth a lot longer than we have he's been studying your human nature for a long time and if we don't get if we don't get the endurance of the Holy Ghost day by day week by week month by month he's going to outlast us come on somebody we don't need just one feeling of the Holy Ghost but we need filling after filling after filling that we can last all the way till we step into her body change you see God has placed us here for a purpose and he said brother Branham says this he's looking for a time-tested memorials as he can say there's my servant I've tested him I've tried him I put him through like job he still proves a hundred percent God be merciful to us that we can take God at his word and be time tested memorials oh my God this place is here to reflect the other Kingdom you know I was listening to brother Branham and brother Branham was preaching on time tested memorials and he's talking about how the children of Israel they went across the Jordan River and as there was going across them their place stones and that was to be a memorial of the grace of God that was to be a memorial of the power of God and I thought I looked at the scripture and the scripture says you are lit Lively songs and so God ain't looking for a natural Memorial where he can point to and say there yeah the Jordan River that's where I delivered my people that's where I split the river that's where I set them free but he's wanting some human Stones human memorials where he can point to and say they was bound by drugs and I set them free they was bound by addictions and I set them free they've been in the midst of pressure and I've set them free I brought them through God is wanting some Lively stones that is a living a life above reproach living a life above the pressure you see we can say amen I believe we are the the memorials that God is looking for them but that don't make it easier to stand we still get weary we still get tired and I would think that David would know this feeling you know as my opening scripture says Lord how are they increased that tripled me many are they that rise up against me many that be would say on my soul there is no help for him in God and so he is saying him that there is many that is rising up against me many of them which are saying I've got no help from the Supernatural and David is speaking of the natural that there's human enemies coming against me but I'm speaking of the supernatural that the Supernatural is coming against the bride trying to wear you down but I think David has seen uh David is saying here that I'm amazed that everywhere I look that I'm troubled everywhere I look the enemy is after my soul and I thought Myers that's the way it is with the bride everywhere we look the devil is coming around every corner coming over every coming through every door trying to get us to get wearing and it seems like it'll hear that saying when it rains it pours and it seems like it's an endless amount of rain that is coming on your mind you know you get up your car breaks down and you go to work and something messes up how work or or you burn the supper you're getting ready for church and you're your children give food all over their dress clothes it's pressure trying to wear you down the devil's trying all he can do to wear down your street wear down your confidence wear you down but what I love about David is that if we can save all of his UPS we can see all of his downs we can see how God he was on the mountaintops and we could see him in The Valleys but through it all he was OB he's always saying Thou Art my shield you are my strong tower in the midst of every your position he was pointing back to the supernatural we concealed and he was selected by God himself when he was refused by his father his father was saying his to ready but then God would say I don't look up the outward appearance I look at the heart and so we can see that he is going through ups and downs we read about the people loving him so much that they would sing songs Saul has slayed his thousands but David has slayed us ten thousands but now it's the same people that is saying there is no help for him and God so he is saying where can I turn to because the same people that says I'm great is the same people that are saying I don't have help in God it was God that he slayed the Goliath it was through God that he slayed the giant but now the people is turning against him and says now you're being chased like a dog there's no help for him we're surrounding you but in the midst of it all he never lost his confidence every time he was going through a hard time he wasn't looking at what he achieved but he was looking up the one that anointed him I can only imagine that every time somebody else was trying to kill him he would think back whenever the messenger come to him whenever he was in the pasture and says the prophet wants to talk to you I'm sure he would just think and think my what an amazing time what it was like to come before the prophet and the prophet would pour the anointing girl upon his life he would think my that was a wonderful time but then he could stop and think mine is that anointing still with me or am I by myself my kingdom is against me the very Kingdom that I'm anointed to Reign is against me and then he could say yes my Help Cometh From The Lord the one that fitter the one that started this is going to finish it the one that anointed me to be king is going to help me remain as king and the same God that anointed you to be an overcomer is going to be here to make sure you fulfill your purpose yes you might be tired you might be weary you might be lower but just remember the Lord the one that called you the one that sharted this good work is going to be faithful to complete it he hasn't left you here by yourself but he's working on your life so that you can be a memorial oh my regard wants us to be a memorial David David would say this oh Lord Thou Art and show for me there's a reason why David would say it I lay down and slept how could he sleep whenever he was compassionate about With the Enemy how could you sleep Whenever there was somebody trying to take your soul somebody he says they're trying to eat my flesh they're coming trying to eat his flesh trying to destroy his alive but in the midst of this he lays down to sleep and I thought what guy in his right mind would do this you think that he would want to watch the approaching enemy he would want to watch but David is shaking if I if I'm awake I'm going to try to fight but he is my shield he's my buckler he's my strong tower if God is fighting for me I need to lay down and rest because I'm weary uh Hallelujah you might be trying to fight the battles in your own ability just rest in the strength of the Lord this battle is not yours it is the Lord's come on somebody this battle ain't yours but it is the Lord if you can just look to where your strength comes from when God can fight your battle you remember Jehoshaphat hope this is okay this evening remember Jehoshaphat when Jehoshaphat was going out to battle and I believe there was three kingdoms I believe that was coming against the nation and he was going to go out and fight but the Lord stopped him and says this is not your battle the battle is the Lord's but you notice what he told Jehoshaphat to do he didn't tell Jehoshaphat go get Spears he didn't tell him go get armor go get shields go get swords go get bows and heires but what he did say was go get some singers go get some worshipers this ain't my battle but I want you to create an atmosphere where I feel welcome to come and work come on somebody this ain't your battle but if you can just praise the Lord you might not be able to sing but still make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord create an atmosphere well God himself can come down and fight oh you know Harper the Wayne Lawson say one time he says what are the Angels created for he says they worship day and night day and night and he says you look at when the three Hebrew boys was there when the fiery furnace he says those angels they wanted to come down and show God's Wrath they went in the show how great they were who God but God would tell him no this is a man-sized job so hey brother Wayne would say that these angels they like battle and so whenever God allowed those angels to come down and fight for Jehoshaphat that was a wonderful thing it wasn't a man's battle but God allowed the angels to come down and patch a horse jehoshaphat's battles see the people were so confused that they wasn't seeing a natural enemy they wasn't seeing a natural a natural man but there was a there was a supernatural presence around them that the Bible says they turned on each other and started to kill each other oh come on now you see God hasn't let you hear by yourself you might not see it into the supernatural but the angels are with you every step of the way God himself is with you every step of the way if you can just see him in the Supernatural oh man I slept and then he awakened me this is a man that had been in contact with God not only did he have faith in God but God had faith in him and you see you remember the story of the lady in World War II I believe the bombs were starting to fall and the sirens were going off and there was a grandma inside of this house and the grandchildren were waiting to go to the bomb shelter that they were worried they were afraid and they said Grandma what are you doing she says I'm going to go sleep they says Grandma why are you going to sleep for we're in the middle of a raid where where the bombs are dropping around us and she says the Bible says that the Lord does not Slumber him and he does not sink why should both of us be awake I'm going to go rest oh come on now even in their Darkest Hour God does not sleep he does not Slumber so you might be weary this morning get some rest under the almighty God Under The Presence of Jehovah oh get some rest this evening and let God lift you up in the midst of the pressure oh my you see everything is designed to destroy you every spirit is designed to destroy him you look at Isaiah 54 and 17 the no weapon that is formed against him shall prosper so the devil don't just have any weapon but he's got formed weapons especially for you he's been watching he he notices what what your weaknesses are he knows where you were where your problems are he knows what you love the most you see you notice where did job get attacked by the devil you see why did the devil say when God asked him if he can consider job you look at job one and nine then Satan answered the Lord and said thus job fear God for not has not done made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that that he hath on every side and hath blessed the work of his hands and the substance is increased in the land and so before job every car before the devil ever come before God job already done his homework or the devil already done his homework he already knew what job loved he already knew what was precious in job's life and so whenever God gave the okay the devil didn't just say okay how am I going to attack job I think I'm going to come this way I think I'm I'm gonna cause him to that the records donking or I'm gonna cause him to do this I'm gonna cause him and his wife to have respect but no before the God ever gave the permission to attack job he had already scouted out job come on now so before the devil has ever attacked you he already has weapons that are specifically formed just for you but the Bible says that the the Bible says that when the Devil Comes against job he attacked his children you know what the Bible says before Judah his children was attacked he was doing the birth sacrifice for his children and so the devil knew this was the important this was important in job's life and so we know that whatever we stand for the Devil is going to attack whatever you think is right the devil is going to attack but you notice what the Bible says about job in Job 1 and 22 in all of this job sinned and not knew nor charge God foolishly so in the midst of all of the pressure he did not charge God and says what are you doing to me but he still sins and not where the Branham says the word sin is unbelief so in the midst of the prayer worship his faith still remained oh man this is a memorial that we can look at and say even in the midst of the pressure I'm can still remain he was looking to a promise you know brother Branham talks about Jonah it was Jonah that was in the belly of the whale he says we think though we've got some some infirmities we've got some bad things but he says Nothing Compares so Jonah as he was in that belly but he says he turned he says supernaturally he was led to turn towards the temple and he reminded God of his promise that he made towards Solomon whenever Solomon built the temple he he prophesied and says when Aaron When anybody is in need may they turn towards this Temple and you deliver them out of their need and brother Branham says he didn't have an oxygen tank inside of the will he didn't he we don't know how he survived but supernaturally he turned towards the temple oh supernaturally he turned towards the temple and began to pray the prayer the Solomon prophesied oh man we're being led by the spirit of God if you can just turn your eyes to where your help comes from if you can turn your eyes in the midst of the infirmities and see the God has promised he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you but he will be with you all the way to the end of the world but you see David knew before anybody could get to him they had to get through his shield he knew his shield was the Lord the anointing of his life could never be destroyed he didn't want the shield of Saul he wanted the anointing he wanted the anointing and I thought mine that should be our attitude we don't want good ideas we don't want good opinions but give me the anointing we don't want what man thinks is right give me the anointing and the anointing only comes by the word but you see a shield we're standing between David and his enemy and it was the net and there was a spiritual shield and here we are standing in legal to see him and there is a shield that is standing between us and the enemy you know brother Branham would pray in the prayer line he was says oh Lord send your anointing and stand between me and the enemy change your anointing to stand between me and the enemy it was the shield in the time of trouble and I thought my the shame anointing they were standing between him and cancer is the same anointing that is standing between us and every pressure that we go through we're living in a crazy time but the anointing remains our minds are being attacked but the anointing remains our body is being attacked but the anointing Remains the Bible says touch not my anoint him and so the devil can come and try to touch her but if the anointing is on your life there's nothing the devil can do to destroy you the Bible says wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts and so the shield that God has given us ain't just taking some of the fiery darts but in the midst of the pressure every darts that is coming against you the anointing is covering up every trial that you go through the anointing is right there hallelujah we're not going through it by yourself but the anointing is we're first oh not some of them but all of them shall be quenched up this is why we can rest when we feel like our world is falling apart you see because it's not us keeping our sanity it's the anointing the Bible would say if it had not been for the Lord who was on our side when the enemy rose up against us now I'm sure we all can say Amen to that if it had not been for the Lord it was the Lord that raised up a standard when the enemy was coming in like a flood the Bible would say in Psalms 34 and 19 many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth them out of them all but the Brandon would say it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that has brought me this form it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is going to take me on that's it yes sir it was good for me back there and it's good for me right now it will be in the hour of my very death just the same way the shame anointing that has brought me this form is going to be the same anointing that is going to take me through that we may get weary but the anointing is there I hope this is okay this evening but like I quoted earlier the Bible says that David I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from where my Help Cometh From my help coming from the Lord which made Heaven and Earth so he's looking to the one that gave the anointing and Psalms 27 and 1 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is my strength of My Life whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies my foes come upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and found though a host shouldn't cap against me my heart shall not fear the wars rise up against me and this will I be confident so he's saying my heart is not going to fear because in this I am confident oh my but you see in Psalms 27-5 from the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle he shall hide me he shall set me upon a rock and so the security that he is finding in the midst of trouble is coming from The Rock and I thought mine that is what we're getting our security from it's the rock of Revelation he has set us upon the rock in the midst of depression in the midst of Oppression in the midst of Mind battles he has placed us upon a solid foundation that no matter what comes against us the fire is trying us but because of the right foundation we're standing in the midst of it all we're standing in the midst of it all and we can realize it's just a season it's just a season The Season's going to change come on now it's hot right now but the seasons is starting to change we're getting nice weather we're getting cooler weather if you like the winter just wait the season's going to change and right now we might be in a season of pressure but the season changer is in the building to change the season where you can step out of the trial and step into a rest oh that trial ain't going to destroy you but God is going to bring you through with the strong and mighty hand you see we can look at the man that was at the pool of bethesla the Bible says it was a certain season and it was a certain season Jesus walked by that pool and the Bible says in John 5 and 7 the impotent man answered sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another step of town before me and Jesus said unto him rise and take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole but the Branham says this man could get around he could talk he could walk but he was just feeble did you catch that he was just feeble he could walk he could talk he could get around but he was just tired and since he was tired he could not operate what he was born with he was born with legs he was born able to walk but since he got weary he could not operate what he was born with and I started to think about it when we're born again we've got joy we've got peace we've got love we've got long suffering we've got faith that is standing against the time but once we get weary we can operate what we're born with come on somebody if we get weary and worn out we can't operate the faith like we used to we used to have faith to move mountains now Faith is still there you've just gotten tired you just need to you need to get a Rest In The Presence of Jehovah you see the definition of feeble is a lacking strength so we lack the strength to put in the and put into action what he was born with but the Bible says he was in this condition for 38 years 38 years he was able to walk but did not have the strength to do it come on somebody in time and we said in this in this position of weariness for year after year after year not being able to overcome not being able to have joy and peace it's because you got tired this morning the season changer is in the building he was in a season of weariness but then it was a certain season not a season of weariness but the season changer stepped on the scene you notice what the Bible calls him the Bible costs him the the impotent man but notice after Jesus said rise up and carry your bed he doesn't call him the impotent man but he says the man was made whole the identity changed when the season changed come on somebody his identity changed when the season changer come on the scene and changed the circumstances you might be weary you might be tired you might be wore out that might be your identity this evening but the season changer has come on the scene to change the season that you're in you're in the season of tiredness you're in the season of weariness but God has come down to save that to lift you up and to give you a rest give you a strength that you can press on you're not meant to be begging you're meant to be walking you're not meant to be be crawling around and seeing you're meant to be marching forward you see this man he could not fulfill his actual Authority that he had because he was wearing but then there come the season changer that come on the scene and says you're no longer an impotent man but you're the man she's like that you're the man you're you're the man that is going to show forth my glory you're the man that is going to show forth my power and you're not meant to be weary you're meant to be the man the woman the bride show me for the power of Jesus Christ you see as she is season changed when the weariness lives and you look at Isaiah 40 and 31 but they thou wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint in other words you're trying to run but you're wearing you're trying to walk but you're fainting but the spirit of the Lord is in the building to change the season where you can run and not be weary oh Hallelujah you want to be on fire again on the things of God get in the season Changers presence then he can say he can change the season but the Brandon would say God took a baby a baby born never did see in his life at 16 years old his Iowa his side back to him God can make God can take a miserable Rich of a cancer eaten person he says then because the message is right because God sent the message because God sent the messenger no doubt every gun of Hell will be firing at him that's right he'll stumble and fall and get back up and shake his head and go on now I thought mine we might stumble we my fault we might get tripped up but we are going forward getting back up shaking our head but the brand I must say he in the same quote he says Get Up shake his hand and go on we got a message nothing is going to stop and Hallelujah Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it they can say what they want to do what they want to the devil can rage and how but Jesus raised from the dead he lives today in us he says we must stumble we might fall but get back up we've got a message to carry come on now get up out of the Gloom get up out of the weariness get up out of the condemnation we've got a message to go forth with Upon This Rock excuse me upon the shrock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not shaken you see you look at Matthew Matthew 10 or 22 and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved he that endureth not he that followeth but the he that gets back up and endures amen as the musicians come this evening you know I was thinking of the story earlier remember when David was at a low spot he and his men had come back to ziglag I believe that's how you say it I'm bad at pronouncing words but I think it was ziglag and say come back and the not the Philistines but the amorites the amalekites had come into the town and taken away the families taking away the children taking away the women taking away all the spoils and the Bible says that his men turned against David and was ready to Stone him ready to Stone him because because the the enemy are coming in and taken away their families but the Bible says that David encouraged himself from the Lord he found his encouragement when his family turned against him he found his encouragement in the one that anointed him hope hope this has come together this evening the only way you're going to find your encouragement is to look to the one that anointed you you know I know there's a thing called stress eating whenever you get stressed out you want to eat some people are different some eat some do this some do that they're stressed out so they're trying to find comfort in something and here David was a finding comfort in natural things he was Finding comfort and the one that anoints at him Natural Things ain't going to bring Comfort a new car ain't going to bring Comfort a nice house ain't going to bring Comfort a boyfriend or a girlfriend ain't gonna bring Comfort but the one that gave the anointing can bring comfort and his God not the other ones God but my God and David said to to the priest son I pray they bring me hither the yes and an epiphar brother thither but thither the Epitaph the David and David inquired of the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them and he answered him pursue for Thou shalt overtake them and without fail recover all what was his encouragement pursue recover it all pursue pursue and cover it and recover it all watch the encouragement of the Lord saying you might have lost your joy you might have lost your peace the pressure might have taken your love away but pursue it pursue it and take back your joy take back your peace Take Back Your Love take back everything the Devils go from you you're still a warrior just get up and fight you're still cold I'm still your Shield David I'm still your Shield I'm still your buckler you're still anointed but get up get out of that discouragement get out of that condemnation and let's fight let's take it back and this evening get out of the the discouragement get out of the condemnation get out of it and let's fight let's move forward you're still anointed for this you're still called You're Still chosen you just need to get out of that weariness get out of that weary state but random tells the dream of the brother had he says the devil is coming and scaring him I would say boo and brother Branham says the man would get smaller when he got scared and the devil got bigger and he says the man the devil said boo the man got smaller the devil got bigger but then the man turned in and grabbed the Bible and he said boo back and the man says in the dream the devil got smaller and he got bigger he said it again boo he says the man the devil got smaller and the man got bigger and so he was Tiny and brother Brandon says this when I said boo every time I said boo he got smaller I got bigger that's it you've got to fight him sooner or later and that distract me he says you've got to fight him sooner or later so the spirit of weariness you've got to fight sooner or later a spirit of condemnation you've got to fight sooner or later the spirit of depression you've got to fight sooner or later amen that's about our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord you are our Shield father you're a buckler you're still Jehovah Jireh Lord You're Still Jehovah Rapha father you still heal all of our diseases but Lord our times we get weary where we
