ahead and and um uh we're going to look look here in the Book of Genesis the thirr chapter and and actually I've got some questions here tonight I think I'm just going to deal with some of the some of the questions and comments and and then um uh and and we'll still be free if anyone wants to add to on on the um the two trees or the serpent seed or anything like that because I want you all to have a have a uh a wonderful revelation of what uh of what this is I think I think if you understand what the original sin is it'll help you it'll help you understand the rest of the Bible that's right and um and so we we want that we want to um just take advantage of it while we're in this section of the of the church age book Let's look here in Genesis um three and um and we're just going to um we're going to just start here at the 14th verse and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly Thou shalt go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise and I I I don't really understand why they call it bruise because actually the literal says Crush thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you again tonight for your blessings thank you for your wonderful presence that we feel Lord we thank you for your love and your mercies for all of those Lord these needs that were prayed for earlier oh God Lord I Thank you than you for strengthening every one of these Lord I I'm asking that your Holy Spirit would would just come and intervene Lord kaye's too young to be having these headaches father and we're we're looking to her Lord I ask that

with the Martins tonight father strengthen them Lord I I pray that your Mighty Angels would be there with them and comforting them Father now Lord we as we open your word we ask that you would open our understanding to your word and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated so we're we're going to have after uh the service tonight um uh at the toward the end of the at the end of the service we we're going to uh we we'll put the place where the funeral is going to be for Earl Gideon and um uh and now if you need to turn these these monitors here down just a tatter uh there's a little bit of an echo up here um on these here it's a little bit harder because it's it's U it it bounces back oh that's better yeah so um so we we want to we've been blessed to be with brother and uh brother Steve and Sister Laura um since this um we we went up there Sunday evening and uh was we got up there about 8:00 and so uh we uh just you know ministering to them the the best we can and um and I think that we were a great uh strength I think that your your prayer is a great strength to them and um uh there's I I guess um as far as I know there's only one Among Us that one one couple Among Us that has lost uh a son about that same age and and uh knowing knowing the the um torment and the things that that brother Merl and sister Leah have have gone through uh in their minds and and um it it makes you it makes you uh want to reach out in prayer for somebody else when you see them in that need and and so um so we we want we want to just continue to pray and uh so uh we'll give you the the name of the place and the address and things at the end of the service tonight now uh we've had a few questions come in over since last Wednesday night about um um just just questions that people are embarrassed to ask um about in front of everybody thinking that they're stupid questions and and uh um but there's no stupid questions at all uh when it comes to the gospel you you ain't going to know unless you ask you know and so um but so we're just going to I'm going to start off with a with a question here tonight um and um uh it says how could the Beast uh um Talk Eve or convince Eve to sin if the Beast wasn't the devil and uh in other words how could the Beast have such knowledge and so um and I think that's a that's a good question and I first of all want to say that that God put the human being he put Adam and Eve his sons and daughters on the earth with a um with a free moral agency as a free moral agency so they had the ability to act as God and to choose they they they had the right they had the ability within themselves to say yes or to say no and and so their conscience was there that that dictates to them now animals do not have a soul and so um therefore they cannot choose between right and wrong an animal you can you can you can teach a dog to um fetch sit roll over you can teach uh you can teach you know bears you can teach uh elephants you can teach all but they uh and and and that's they you're you're able to teach them so far but an animal does not know right or wrong they they they they have they have no they don't know they're naked they don't know uh they they have no morals about them because uh they are they are an animal and so um but the Beast the Beast was different because the Beast had a place for a soul right Satan has a soul and so Satan comes amen and and and and moves inside this beast and is able to communicate these Facts of Life able to um amen bring this this sin before them so the beast in itself did not it it amen it it wasn't that the um that that the Beast was anointed amen I'll just put it that way the Beast the the he was he he was inhabited by the Devil Himself he moved inside them and the prophet would say he changed the serpent in every way that it had to that had to be done that would confuse this generation who's trying to find bone that looks some kind like some kind of an animal that was part of Man part part animal to say there's where man they've lost it from the chimpanzee only the chimpanzee doesn't have an intelligence the chimpanzee does not have a soul has not a soul he cannot think he's now just a noise or a horse can ghee hul and and something like that dog come here pH o do a trick jump over these and setting blocks up and things uh that by emotion and hearing and things like that and action uh but to think and to understand they can't they they don't know they're naked they don't know the male and the female the difference like that they have no laws of such human beings is the only one and the next one to the human being was The Serpent and the Bible said he was the most subtle of all the Beast of the field smarter he had almost had a se he had a place for a se but what did he do he sold out to Satan to deceive or to try to deceive God Amen and then he asked the question now how how many he gets that this far and so here here the serpent is here the the serpent is he's not a reptile now he's not hanging on a tree like people say the Bible says that he he went to his belly after the curse he went on his belly afterwards amen stripped him of his legs stripped him of his arms the Bible says amen if you want to if you want to look at it there in in Genesis 3 and 1 now this the serpent was more subtle than any reptile in the garden no no he was more subtle than any beast of the field which God had made and he the serpent said so this serpent could talk right amen and and he said You shall not eat asking the question hey you you're not supposed to eat he's beginning to reason with her he's beginning to talk and the woman answered back to the serpent so now amen so so she's not answering to a talking snake she is answering to a being that looked very much like a man amen he was very much man and so so we so I want you to understand that now because Satan uh had had had now entered into this serpent now brother brandham would say and and and and we will um and and just for those of you that might want to uh that that might be asking does you said the devil had a soul amen and brother bradam did say he said um he says there's a requirement for sin the requirement was death death was the penalty we go into great details of this because I do not believe that there is one but there is but one death there is one life I believe a man that has eternal life can never die I believe there is complete annihilation of that soul that sins for the Bible said the soul that sinth it shall surely die not the man the soul that sinth so Satan must surely die to be completely annihilated how I disagree with the Universalist that said Satan will be saved he sinned he's the originator of sin his soul sinned and he was a spirit and that's Spirit shall be totally annihilated uh to be nothing left of it so so before we move to the next question the first question was how could how could that Beast amen made in the Perfection of God or made in When God says that it was all things were good how could that be well amen Satan found an opportunity to possess that serpent amen none of the animals life had a so but this one here had a place and Satan come in found that place amen and there's where there's where s now now listen it whatever took place whatever that serpent done has now become synonymous with the devil any time that God anytime that God's dealing with the devil he calls him that old serpent that's right that old serpent the devil that old serpent the he's he's one he's one and the same because he he he became uh uh he was is United together can you say Amen another question was how did the devil end up in the garden and and the question is well he was kicked out of heaven uh because of sin and so uh uh that's that's how he ended up in the garden now I think the question is probably a little bit more direct how did God allow that Devil Inside the garden to talk to Eve in the first place and um um I I I believe that uh you know first of all that God's God's got a big plan God knew what was going to take place at the beginning and God also knew how many knows that God knew what Satan was going to do Satan didn't pull anything over on God Satan God knew exactly what was going to take place God's Eternal God never has a new thought God knew you God knew this service God knew every time you you you'd raise your hand in the service or every time that you would burp amen he he there is not a thing on this Earth that God does not know God knew the fall before the fall got here can you say Amen so amen but I want I want us to look why how how did God how did the devil end up here on the earth amen there're in Isaiah 14 and 12 and and you can you can write these down uh I I've got I've got about seven or eight these questions here and so I'm going to just take a little bit of time um he says um Isaiah 14:12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which this weakens the Nations for thou H has said in thine heart now when when you start talking in your heart and you've got a pride issue amen you you you've got to remember when pride comes before the fall so when you start exalting yourself just remember God's going to put you down amen and and God will make you can God will share his glory with no man he's the good one and you're just the one that he's anointing he's the one you're the one that he has called that that he can work through can you say Amen now I want you to watch this what watch his attitude thou said in thine heart I will Ascend into uh into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God God I will sit upon also upon the Mount of the congregation and the signs of the north I will Ascend above uh the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high God yet thou sh be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit so so what caused him what what caused him to be cast out of heaven in the first place it was his pride amen it was that pride in him that was that that was causing him to uh that lifting himself up above God Amen lifting himself up seeing himself in a little bit different light than what maybe God seen him as amen and you got to and we we've all got to be careful amen don't don't let me go through life uh and me the only one thinking what I'm thinking of myself amen let let me go through life making sure that uh we're all thinking about the same same can you say Amen we don't want to go through life with our heads in the clouds and thinking that we are just right next to God and um maybe maybe God doesn't think that way now so pride is going to will will will cause you to to to lose now let's look real quickly Ezekiel 28:12 let's look a little bit about this about this uh about Satan Lucifer now first of all uh as you're turning there Luke or Ezekiel 20 and2 he Lucifer was the son of the morning he was the angel of Light amen he was the angel of Light he was a cherub them and the cherubs were the ones they were the throne guards they were the ones that were took that took uh special CU they never left the throne they were right there with with the master amen and and so let let's look here uh in the 12th verse son of man take a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus sayith the Lord God thou seest up the uh up the sum full of wisdom perfect in Beauty thou Hast been in Garden or in Eden the Garden of God now I want I want to say right here we know that the king Tyrus could not have been an Eden at that time uh uh Eden was 4,000 uh years before but God was talking to the devil that was in that man right amen and so so yes king the king of Tyrus was uh you know he he wasn't back there in the garden but God was dealing with that devil that that had possessed that man that's what the prophet said amen and so and then it goes on it says every precious stone was thy covering the the sardus the topaz the diamond the burill Onyx The Jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle uh the gold the the workmanship of thy tab and thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe cherub that coverthe set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created created till iniquity was found in thee and by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou Hast sinned therefore I have cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy the old covering cherub the m in the from the midst of the stones of the fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty and thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness now now I want you to really catch pride pride if there's anything that the human being has got to fight and that's pride pride comes from the master of all Devils Lucifer himself is the originator of Pride right and so so pride pride is something that I believe that we should be watching with everything we've got to keep a proud spirit away from us amen and I want to tell you you can't tell me I I mean I I'm here to tell you I this old fat bald man will look in the mirror and sometimes think you know you're not bad looking Hallelujah Pride will you Pride will will ease up on any of us he'll do it to all of you musicians Amen to where you just get to thinking that man you've got life by the tail right you he'll do it to you uh uh song leaders preachers he'll do it to every one of us come on how many's ever had to fight pride in your life amen we we all have to battle that but now remember it defiled the sanctuary and God kicked him out amen and he says I will cast you to the ground now if if if you and of course we understand that there in in Revelations 12:7 that there was a war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and and and fought uh and his angels and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was there a place uh anymore in the heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him sir so so all of the trouble we have here on the Earth was because there was a sin that took place in heaven so the first sin was not in the Garden of Eden the first sin was in heaven and it was a pride issue by a a talented a talented uh uh angel that God had put to his I mean God had put him right next to him and said you stay right here by my throne and you you you I'm I'm putting I he he exalted this this this Angel and this Angel begin to look at himself as if ha my position is great and then he looked over at Michael and he says I think my position is even greater than yours and then before you know it there's this battle that is going on and there's a fight is going on and then there's a power struggle in the church right the first Power struggle did not happen in the garden the first happened in God's Own Church in his Sanctuary amen so so power struggles amen is is what calls the first sin and so we want to remain humble amen now why would God allow uh um why would god let's see it sound like the same question uh how did the devil end up in the garden then then there was another one why would God even allow Satan in the garden and and so and I think I answered that while ago because God's got a law a great law of contrast and so amen uh God God is a god of many attributes and God also had Divine knowledge pre- knowledge of what was going to take place and so the attribute of healer can only come from someone who has fallen and and needs healing amen the the Divine attribute of forgiveness can only come for somebody that has sinned the Divine attribute of Savior can only be for for one that uh and that has sinned so God allowed it yes God could have stopped it but God in his Divine wisdom and his Divine intelligence knew what was going to take place and so God allowed that amen is everyone is everyone okay with that now amen so so another one was there were two trees in the Garden of Eden uh in the midst of the garden right the Tree of Life from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen were they not allowed to eat of the tree of n of Life uh either if so why and so uh there in Genesis 2 and6 would just read this here together and and now if you uh I am glad to see some some uh some of y'all taking notes um I want youall to get I want youall to catch us and then afterwards um I've also got some of these um booklets uh little booklets I'd like to hand to to uh you young people that's that's old enough to read them and and appreciate them so I've got some of those here if you don't have these these booklets I want I want youall to get get one of these um brother Tim I put this out and um I where where did you where did you come up where did you find that okay okay well good well good I'm I'm I I I I couldn't I couldn't quite make it out in the text whether or not she was on my side or yeah yeah well that's pretty good amen okay so uh uh Genesis 2:16 it says and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest eat freely but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so the tree of life was in the midst of the garden now God did separate them God did separate these two trees to let you know you know as we read as we read last week all of the trees in the garden is is is good for food and also God and God put also the tree of life and the tree of knowledge so he's letting them know that these are not they're not the these are not just natural fruit trees but these are spiritual trees amen and one was the Tree of Life which was the word of God it was Christ himself the logos God and then there was also uh uh Satan and these Spirits were there these these anointed ones were there to uh uh uh in relation brother Brandon would say as we read in the church age book last week he said now this the reason that these two trees were put there they they were there in direct relation with with Adam and Eve God's children and so I think you guys were not going to have to go through that here tonight everybody understand so the tree of life is what they were supposed to take up they were supposed to partake of God's word and God's word alone that's what they were supposed to take that was the tree of life but when you refuse the tree of life and you you accept knowledge over the tree of life and once again amen knowledge can never take the place of the experience of Life it'll never take knowledge cannot we're thankful for knowledge and we grow in knowledge but knowledge there will come a time where all of your knowledge if you live long enough to can just take all of that totally away that's right and if you're not on the tree of life you're in trouble that's right you you you you you you get to the all of that knowledge that you love right now and I love seeing these young men uh and and these young women and and all of the the the man I how I oh how I could love to just be that young again and and vigorous and and full of energy and learning things and and and like that again amen but I'm on this side of the spum now and and and and I'm having to rely on the tree of life more than I ever have amen all right praise the Lord all right so another question God created two of everything right so were there more than one Beast that got cursed now that's a good question and uh uh I I would say maybe and then I would say yes because the the the curse totally took out that link so so what we don't know whether or not this was a special this was a special Beast that was created for a special purpose we we don't know we don't we we we we don't know if that but I guarantee you if that if that Beast had a mate she wasn't proud of her man I guarantee you that going on your belly the rest of your life is not is is is is not a not a good thing amen so um but I I would I would say I I would I I I sort of lean toward the the thought that this was this was a prepared this was a prep prepared um a beast just as the whale was a prepared fish now that's just my opinion I can't I I I I I don't I I don't know and I there wasn't anything that I could find uh in the message on that um and if you do find something else on that give that to me I I want to put that in my Arsenal praise the Lord so um okay so the another question was and how many how many appreciates these questions I appreciate all of these questions cuz it's I I think it's good for us all uh uh uh uh to to partake of and think of the next one is is why did the bible say that Cain came from the Lord and so um and I think I think the the scripture that is being used here if we go to Genesis 4 And1 sister Keys um and and now this is now those that are just coming in for for T night's service you you missed last Wednesday night and so we're just sort of picking up some questions from that came from last Wednesday night um but Genesis 4 and one Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I have gotten a man uh from the Lord now now we um let let me turn there amen uh and and she be and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the ground but Cain was a tiller of the ground so so I want you to look at this one one one time Adam knew his wife one act and then in the same and then in within those verses She bear Cain and she also bear able now but she specifically said um I have gotten a man from the Lord now here's what here's what the prophet said you you says now the question is Eve said I have gotten a man from the Lord that's exactly right you could take the Orest woman in the town the worst man and if they have the baby a baby it would have to come from the Lord because God has set laws has laws set together and of these laws like the son to raise you put a caber in a good field it'll grow it has to grow because it's God's law and when seed is planted it must grow and nothing can grow life but God because it operates under his laws now I thought that was a good explanation that's a good explanation so that that life now now now Satan had sold his seed into the womb of of Eve but it was and and and but it was it was uh uh but God is the one that gave the life amen so God is the one that gets gives the life now now here's another one that I thought I would bring in and and he and he's talks he's talking about the a deceived church and and he he says now when evil seed was planted into the womb of Eve it had it had to bring forth because it's God's law of reproduction it could do nothing else but bring it it had to come from God and when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything it is like Eve when Cain was born she said I've gotten a man from the Lord now do you realize that she really meant that she thought that she had a man from the Lord you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the word of God she then thought that whatever she said was right now think about that tree of Knowledge Tree of Life and once she partook of this knowledge she truly truly believed that she had more understanding than that that was on the tree of life right it's amazing how the tree of knowledge thinks that it's so much higher than the word of God come on right see and the knowledge it was the knowledge that puffs up it was the knowledge that caused her to be deceived in the first place to think that she had something greater and that God was trying to keep her from that and and trying to keep her subordinate and and when when the serpent had said God knows in the day that you eat of this that you're going to be wise like him and he's he don't want you and she goes oh really give me to eat see and so so that's the way it is so he says if she said that she had a man from God then she had a man from God that's the way she believed it but God had set laws in his Universe a good seed can only bring forth good fruit an evil seed can only bring forth evil fruit now each seed though different will utilize the same Earth nourishment moisture Sunshine but it will bring forth after its own kind notice the history of Cain the Cain line and then notice the history of the Seth line only one difference between them The Original Seed nothing else amen all right another another question um where in the Bible does it say The Serpent is Cain's father well I think that's a good question and um how many can tell me is that does anyone know where that one's found out where it says that that the uh that Cain was the seed of the devil any any of you youngans all right uh uh first let's look here at first first John uh three and um let's see uh 1 John 3 and 12 it says not as Cain who was of that Wicked one and slew uh his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brother's Works were righteous so so Cain had the had the beastly knowledge uh uh uh characteristics of his father the serpent the devil can you say Amen so so when when you when you look at it look you know Ju Just just look real quickly at at just think here just quickly as we as we think about this the fruit of the serpent compared to the fruit of Adam um and and if you were to look there in Genesis the I believe it's Genesis the 4th chapter um Genesis the 4th chapter it it deals it it deals um uh you know from the sixth verse on down talks about how that that God the the Cain's offering was not accepted Cain got all rebellious and and mad and and you you read that you you read uh those characteristics he he was uh uh he was belligerent he was rebellious he was defiant against God he murdered his half brother he he lied he lied right in the face of almighty God he he was uh uh totally unhuman likee in in his characteristics he was he Cain Cain did not even show the the slightest bit resemblance of Adam that's right Adam was the direct descendant from God Cain was The Descendant from the serpent the evil one the devil and so those characteristics just out out in him just just coming out in him and and and so um um and and and and brother Bram uh would would always point back to this areas too and if you were to if you were to go on down um uh you know uh uh the 16th verse and it it goes on down and it talks about how that uh uh he he was came went out from the presence of the Lord did you know that the first marking of the Beast was Cain Cain was marked that because of his beastly nature he was marked by God right and then you talk about the mark of the beast at the very end amen so he was driven from the presence of the Lord amen then the scripture says in the 17th verse that his first son Enoch he built a city so the first Builders of civil ization came from Allelujah and I know we're electricians and and Builders around here the first builder of a city was K seed amen I I if you were to if you were going down to the 20 uh first verse he said that that he one of his sons was the father of all such as handle the harp and the organ they're they're the one that built this amen the 22nd verse he says he had a son that was an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron you going down to the 23rd verse and then you find that one of his sons amen killed another man and he says for I have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt if K if Cain be a viid Sevenfold truly lmch uh 70 and Sevenfold So So we find that that that civilization murders adulteries and lies all came from Cain it did not come and then and then you so so you can see that Abel Abel was a was he was the son of Adam who was the son of God and he was a farmer he was simple amen he you know but he had a spiritual Insight of a virgin born savior that was to come and he knew the original sin that it was blood and not apples and he he offered the blood of a lamb symbolizing that there was going to be a virgin born son uh so many years later that was going to come and bring bring bring uh Humanity back into their place can you say Amen now now now now listen to this now let's go on down to the 25th verse and Adam knew his wife again now the first of the chapter said and Adam knew Eve and then there came two sons we understand that Eve had already partaken of the fruit amen she's already pregnant then she goes and gives to Adam and now she's pregnant again so now we've got the son of the serpent in her we've got the son of the of Adam in her then we see that the son of the serpent gets jealous of the son of Adam and and then he kills he kills the son of the of Adam and so and the Bible says amen that that the world was just chaotic now watch this watch this 25th verse and Adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name Seth for she said for God she said hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew and to Seth and to him also uh was born a son and he called his name Enos and then began man to call upon the name of the Lord amen once Adam's lineage came back then men began to call on the name of the Lord all right any questions did I mess up I see Smiles amen all right so so any uh uh any anything you want to is this is this too slow amen okay amen so another question and and I thought this is a good one so is it true that Giants come from the relationships between angels and women well there is a very popular that is a very popular argument that that that the Giants uh there in Revel or in Genesis the 6th chapter and the first verse there between six one 1 through 8 and this is where they get this uh that that let's just read let's just read and it came to pass uh 6 and one when man began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and God said my spirit shall not always strive with man for he that is he is also his flesh yet his day shall be 120 years and there were giants in the earth in those days also after that when the sons of uh God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them and the same became Great Men which were of old men of renown and God saw that the wickedness of man was so great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only on evil continually it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repented me that I that I have made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord so the question is okay so who are the sons of God and who are the daughters of men so so uh Joseph cus and and and some of these other uh uh historians and and theologians uh and and and that's what you were talking about the other night brother Joe uh was the you know uh and I don't know that word I can't speak that word again but um these they say Angels came down and had relationships with women and and that the Angels were the sons of God they had relationships with women and then they were produced Giants well amen that sounds good uh it might look good on paper but a spirit cannot have relationship with a woman that was the problem in the garden that's how Satan came in he came in he got in he got into the human race through that serpent Satan had to move inside a body he's a spirit he can't do nothing unless he has a body so he moved inside that body possessed that body and that big beast that was not human that Beast impregnated Eve Eve produced Cain Cain was driven to the Land of Nod and then the sons of God Adam seed and the daughters of men can seed began to come together and there were giants in the land that's how it happened that's that's that's that's that's scripture so amen so so many say many many have tried to first of all are y'all are y'all catching me so far am I am I leaving anybody behind amen so angels can cannot I you know we we with a mixed audience I I don't want to just say words but Angels just Angels can't have sex with women it just can't happen it takes human beings to do those kinds of things you got to a dog's got to have a dog right and so Angels can't do these things so it require so when they they say the sons of God and the daughters of men would go back to the beginning right Cain was the son of the wicked one yes now now you cannot say you cannot there in there in the Book of Matthew says that that it tied Adam directly to the lineage of God it did go back and go back and look at Adam's lineage and from Adam it was God H so now you've got the you've got you've got Cain that is that is tied directly to the evil and you've got Adam that is tied directly well then how can how can Adam be the wicked one you got me you see how that you see how that works now amen so so I want you to see that so Satan he can't create Satan can't do any of that he had to find a body and the Ephesian Church age that we read last week and I'm just going to I'm just going to read just a real a small clip of it as the seed of the woman was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh so was the seed of the serpent so the seed of the serpent is the literal way that Satan found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race it was impossible for Satan for he is only a created spirit being to reproduce himself in the manner in which God reproduced himself so Genesis account tells how he produced his seed and introduced or injected himself into the human race and recall that Satan is called serpent it is his seed or injection into the human race that we are speaking of can you say Amen so so y'all got that amen all right now I want you to if ask questions if you need to um all right uh the another one is is there a certain race that is is is there a certain race uh on earth that is the lineage of The Serpent and um in in other words what's asking is what happened to the serpent what happened to the race the Serpent's race where where are they at some people say it's the black people some people say it's the Jews some people say it's this that and the other um amen but but no there there is no race of people that are the serpent seed in this day since the time of Noah Adam's Adam's race and the Serpent's race has mixed that's what we just read when the sons and daughters come together and and uh mix together so so we we are all in bread it's it's that's just that's just the way in that natural is amen they came over they they God God destroyed the whole the the everything and there was uh uh uh Noah and his wife and his sons and his daughters-in-law eight inla they came over and and I I don't believe that Noah's boys or Noah uh I don't believe God would have chose them to to be on the ark if uh uh if if if if if they were but but they brought daughters-in-law over and so uh so the prophet says that it came over through the ark and went and went on and then we we understand you know but today today you say now now what what would we um uh what then then the then the the serpent seed is is is no longer around oh yes the serpent is still very much alive just like Jesus Christ is still very much alive and we are not we are not the uh Jews but yet we're the Seed of Abraham it's the spiritual lineage we're the seed of Jesus through Jesus He Is We Are of the Seed of Abraham the royal Seed of Abraham the life that was in Abraham is within us that's that's why we've got to have a new birth that's why we've got to have a new birth so Satan today Satan is able to fulfill his his his his plan because humanity is no longer humanity is no longer uh perfect couple in the Garden of Eden well Satan's got the whole world it's it's it it's full of sin perversion is full of all of these things are you understanding so now Satan's got vessels to work with to bring he bring about his spiritual lineage on down all the way to the to till they get cast into the Lake of Fire amen Christ has got his spiritual lineage and and and I Think Jesus let us know what there in in in um in in the New Testament there in Matthew and Luke where he where he talks about the field that was that was sold with seeds God sold his seed seed and then or the good man sowed the seed and then the and then the evil come in and solded his seed and then they were going to grow up into the world until the very end and then there's going to be the the the the the serpent or or the tears and the wheat and and goes on from there can you say Amen all right so we're getting close to being in uh uh but I but I I'm telling you I I can tell you guys are fighting the Sandman really bad amen so uh now I I want I I want you to enjoy this here I don't want y'all being getting too tired and fall asleep listen it's only 8:00 amen a little after praise the Lord and so um amen so punch your neighbor [Music] or so um uh I I think I I I think these questions are good and um uh so okay now matters of fact um I want us to deal with um I I want us I want us to think about that as U since since the fall since the fall uh Satan has has become synonymous with the serpent so it was Lucifer the angel of Light that that moved inside him it was the star of the moment now remember Ezekiel 28:14 if you'd put that back up there again Thou Art the anointed cherub that Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe anointed that that and and and and cover it means to hedge to fence about it means to overshadow it was to guard The Mercy Seat it was the it was to hovering over over the ark and and flanked around the Throne of God of God see so this this was what Lucifer was now Lucifer when he come in he was bringing in that same covering to Eve he was he was coming in now and he was he was skilled at it but he turned bad it used to be to stand there for the things of God and now but now he's now he's covering for his own evil ways and and and and brother brother Bram would say he he'd say and those spirits that come from the Throne of God and stands Before the Throne of God he says he they live billions and billions and ons of time before the world ever began in the presence of God you think they don't know something about worship and they come down and get into men right into men and they worship God absolutely they worship God they have knowledge of God they're smart they're shrewd they're educated always but God rejected them from the beginning and and so so we we want to understand that Cain was a beautiful worshipper Abel's Abel's wor worship was was was nasty Abel's worship was was uh uh blood all over the place the lambas uh gurgling in his blood and and and Abel or and Cain was his worship was beautiful offering that put before God and God rejected his knowledge his his Beauty for the raw revelation of Abel well well I um that that does No I um yes and no you're fighting the flesh you're in a hybrid body that is that that that is for sure that you're you're we're in we are hybrids we fight our our sicknesses and all of those things because we did not come the spoken word way the way that God originally intended but but the but the the nature our nature was closed off when she partook of that tree of knowledge before the Act was even done she had already fallen in in her spirit before God when she accepted the LIE of the devil that's right and so so that and and then when Adam of course partook of that then it it became the same thing so yes it it was it was that act it was per partaken of that tree of knowledge that that that has brought us all into this physical state that we are in but here's the deal brother Joe yet you are a predestinated son of God written in his book Adam was supposed to look at that book and call names off Adam was supposed to be be speaking and and word born Sons come just like Adam was that's the way we're all supposed to be here we're not supposed to be here with complexes we're not supposed to be here diseased and and and and and our ups and downs and up that's that's that's not that's not the way it's supposed to be you see what I'm saying but Christ has redeemed us back it took a virgin born son of God to come and give his blood to to uh uh pay for the blood sin at the beginning so so uh yes it it it it's it's that blood sin that that Christ came to do amen so now you say in the spirit realm now we can understand that God's God the spirit of Christ is here living his life through us now because what did he do he come to set us free from this bondage set that Soul free to now we can communicate back with Spirit God once again yall y'all catching that sons of God are now in the presence of God though living in this body well devils are there there Satan's got his own Clan too I mean amen uh uh you know you you look there there in 2 Corinthians 11: 14 no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light see he's he he's he's ministered I I I I didn't I didn't write it down um man uh I didn't write it down the the other scriptures where but where where Jesus or where the Apostle Paul he says and now his he said it's no wonder that his ministers have turned into uh angels of light Apostles of Deceit they become Ministers of deception just like the serpent did at the beginning they they be they become messengers of deception and so uh but the a but it it'll be the seed of God it was the seed of God that resisted him at the beginning and it's the seed of God that'll resist him at the ending amen amen praise the Lord so any questions here tonight amen anything anyone wants to brother Harry would it be because we know brother brandom told us that sin is unbelief yes and so be accurate to say that each sin started out in the spirit by disbelieving God's word and then it went into the physical with the act that is that that's a good explanation and that's exactly the way the brother brandham done it preached it in um um uh the greatest battle ever fought he he he he deals with that at length before the ACT ual the adultery had already taken place before the actual Act was ever committed because she had stopped partake of knowledge and the soon as she took she soon as she bit into it it was death deception could she she was totally deceived by the time the Act was committed so that's that's that's that's pretty powerful that's pretty powerful you don't stop and leave God's word to partake of of the of the knowledge that Satan wants to bring to us you can't do that and you know I'm that's just just where you know I tell all of you young men you can't do that don't even stop to entertain any thought that that that is that is that that that is trying to say something contrary don't even don't even think about it just run away from it and believe what God says I don't care you don't have to know the other side of the story you don't have to know what everyone else thinks you don't have to get on websites and on the believe the sign and don't just stay away from it don't get don't bite into that fruit whatsoever stay away from it well what if I'm deceived well you're you're you're you you're pretty deceived right now if you're sitting there looking at the Bible and and and seeing the Vindication of what God Said on this day and you're saying what if I can be deceived maybe I should check you're right there at the same tree Eve was at that's right that's right don't you look at that if you see the word of God Vindicated and you see the promise of this day that that's that's been Vindicated by God stay away from knowledge stay away from that stuff stay with God's word can you say Amen but uh uh uh write these down I'm I'm we're going to we're going to close but write these write write these scriptures down Matthew 23 and 33 watch watch what Jesus said you serpents you Generation of Vipers that word generation means offspring of vipers how can you escape the damnation of Hell Matthew 12 and 34 oh generation or offspring of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the moue speaketh Jesus was was declaring that there is that's spiritual lineage these guys could take their lineage all the way back to Abraham that's right right and they were saying we're of Abraham and you don't know what you're talking about and Jesus was saying you're The Offspring of the serpent now let let's look here at John 8:39 they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus said unto him if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which I heard of God this did not Abraham you do the Deeds of your father then they said said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God Jesus now now watch now watch they know they they they knew the serpent Seed doctrine yes they the Jews believed it but see they thought that they it was a it was a natural lineage so they were saying we've got the pure bloodline we we're not we're we're not of that Cain bloodline we're of Abraham's bloodline and we can go all the way back to back and back and back and we can take generation after generation we know who we are and the Jews were people of lineage they kept their family tree that's right and Jesus looks at him and said you're of the lineage of the serpent the father of Cain and they're coming back saying we're not we can prove to you so he says you're of your Deeds you do the Deeds of the your father they say unto him we be not born of fornication in other words our lineage didn't come from Cain we have one father even God Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word you are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from yeah oh boy he's connecting him right to Cain right now he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in truth because there's no truth in him and when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not amen well there is a lineage the lineage of God is going to believe God's word there are humble they're are humble people well can you say man we're all growing up but remember don't you take don't you defend this nature here don't defend this this nature here is not worth defending this this this thing here has got to fall off but that Eternal seat on the inside of you is of god well glory to God Amen amen so so even even the Apostle Paul even even he would say Amen as he's looking there at the Corinthian Church and he's telling the Corinthian Church I believe there where's that at there uh uh I fear Les Satan would beguile you um um praise the lord it's in 2 Corinthians amen you know where that's at brother Merl Oh Sister Cay knows where that's at amen but I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ um let let's let's let's go up where's where's the Virgin i' I've I've uh given you as a virgin okay I'm watch this what watch watch this how he's putting The Serpent and the virginity of this bride together I'm jealous over you with The Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty and she lost her virginity so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ the fourth verse now for he that cometh and preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preed preached or if you received another Spirit whom you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted ye might bear with well bear with him for I suppose I was not a wit behind the very chiefest of the Apostles so so so you you can see y y'all can see how that spiritual lineage the very thing that done it at the be in the Physical Realm is the very thing that is here today to take us away from the word in this day amen cling to the Tree of Life Brothers cling to the tree of life if the musicians would come praise the Lord amen so um who who all has who all has these does everyone have you teenagers especially y'all y'all have these this this

y'all here tonight by the way God bless you amen all right well praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord amen so in the beginning as we as we dismiss in the beginning God had created Adam and Eve I want you to catch this in the first chapter of the Book of Genesis Genesis 1 and 26 God created man in the image of God it was a spirit image God told that Spirit man I'm giving you do I I I giving you dominion over the foul of the air fish of the Sea Beast of the field I want you to multiply and replenish the Earth and take dominion over it but man didn't have a body there was no body Adam was given this Authority and no body the Bible says and there was no man to plow the field we have that problem sometimes in the church amen everyone's all in spirit wanting to do something anyways so but God's got to have bodies so here we stand now we're looking at Genesis 2 and 7 heav and the Bible says and the Lord God created man from the death of the field there is not one place given where he told that man replenish and multiply that was given to the spirit man in Genesis 1:26 Genesis 2 and7 was simply what the were supposed to do what man was going to use to take care of the garden Satan came in and says hey never mind the spirit let me let me show you a few things here and he found a way in to the body of the human race and that's how sickness and death and pride and all of this stuff all came in and we're the subject we're subject to that Jesus came and says all right you got your body yeah that that you know you're you're you're getting smarter you you got your body you you know you you've done good for yourself you've built big cities you're doing it all I've got to get you back to Genesis 1:26 Jesus came the Virgin born son of God hung on Calvary to pay for your sex sins and the sin of unbelief to take you back so that you can fulfill Genesis 1:26 see man's been trying to subdue the Earth with Genesis 2 and 7 but God's called you to dominate the Earth with Genesis 1:26 just trying to bring it down pretty pretty simple here amen God bless [Music] you oh yes oh oh yes oh yes I'm a oh his Ro now flows through my face and I was rich and born now
