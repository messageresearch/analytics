[42:50] just going to speak just real
[42:53] uh on a on a simple thought

[43:03] that I uh was just really impressed upon
[43:08] last night um in the in the middle of
[43:12] the night actually I got up um had these
[43:15] on my mind and so to the we hours of the
[43:17] morning um looking
[43:20] over these scriptures and so I know that
[43:23] the Lord when he places something on
[43:25] your heart
[43:26] uh there's a reason for that and and so
[43:31] I you know I've I've served the Lord
[43:33] enough to know to just it's just best to
[43:36] follow his leadership amen amen let's
[43:39] look here in in James 1 and 12 blessed
[43:43] is the man that endureth
[43:46] Temptation for when he is tried he shall
[43:49] receive the Crown of Life which the Lord
[43:52] ha promised to them that love him let no
[43:56] no man say when he is tempted I am
[43:58] tempted of God for God cannot be tempted
[44:01] with evil neither tempteth he any man
[44:05] but if every man but every man is
[44:07] tempted when he has drawn away of his
[44:09] own lust and is in and
[44:12] enticed but when lust hath conceived it
[44:16] brings forth sin and sin when it is
[44:19] finished brings forth death do not he my
[44:23] beloved brother uh uh Brothers he he
[44:27] says every good gift every perfect gift
[44:30] is from above cometh down from the
[44:33] Father of Lights with whom uh is no
[44:37] variableness neither shadow of turning
[44:39] of his own will beget he us with the
[44:42] word of truth that we should be the kind
[44:44] of first fruits of his creatures let's
[44:48] go to the Lord in
[44:50] prayer Lord we want to thank you today
[44:52] for your goodness for your blessings
[44:55] today Lord Lord thank you for your
[44:59] amazing love to us thank you for the
[45:02] anointing of the Holy
[45:04] Spirit Lord as we have sung the songs
[45:09] and listening to Lord the special that
[45:13] was that was brought this morning
[45:15] and Lord we are so
[45:18] thankful we're not a we're not a proud
[45:21] people we're a thankful people and I'm
[45:25] asking God this that you would speak to
[45:27] us this morning because we
[45:29] truly want to hear from
[45:32] you Lord is we want to learn and Lord we
[45:37] want your presence to be here among us
[45:39] to make us exactly like you want us and
[45:42] we'll give you glory and honor in the
[45:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the
[45:48] church say
[45:49] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[45:52] seated here this
[45:54] morning
[45:56] so each age um Has are
[46:02] has had to overcome with every age has
[46:07] had to
[46:08] overcome now it's an incredible thing
[46:12] when you think of each age having to
[46:15] overcome because when you when you think
[46:17] about receiving the baptism of the Holy
[46:20] Ghost you think well when you receive
[46:23] the Holy Ghost amen the nature of God is
[46:26] in you um then you're free from any
[46:31] Temptation you're free
[46:34] from um you you you you just it's it's
[46:37] going to be a walk in the part amen
[46:41] there's uh you've got God's life living
[46:43] in you he's living his life through you
[46:47] and um amen so uh don't have to worry
[46:52] about lust you don't have to worry about
[46:55] uh evil thoughts don't have to worry
[46:56] about a lot of things but it's it's
[46:59] quite the opposite amen because now
[47:04] there is a desire within you Amen to
[47:08] live the life of God and yet Satan is
[47:12] there to hinder you in every way so each
[47:16] one of these Seven Ages every one of
[47:20] them and there was Bar None all seven of
[47:24] them was was given
[47:27] rewards when they
[47:29] overcame so so you just because you have
[47:33] the Holy Ghost amen does not make you an
[47:38] automatic Overcomer it gives you
[47:40] something to overcome with amen so we're
[47:44] setting in this building here today and
[47:46] many of times when we're preaching the
[47:48] gospel and and and and we're laying it
[47:51] out there and and Satan can turn around
[47:54] and tell you you must not have the Holy
[47:57] Ghost many times amen Satan will tell
[48:00] you uh well you know you just must not
[48:02] have your life together or you must be
[48:05] this you must not be bride or you must
[48:07] listen amen you are still living in a in
[48:11] a in a body it's a carnal body you're
[48:14] dealing with a carnal spirit amen and
[48:18] and you are you are having to overcome
[48:22] amen but there is something I'm thankful
[48:25] to for the gra of God within us amen
[48:27] because the grace of God within us has
[48:30] given us the power to overcome the
[48:33] wisdom to overcome given us the tools
[48:37] Amen to live an overcoming life amen now
[48:42] if we uh brother brandham would say he'd
[48:45] say now now each Church age the same
[48:48] overcome when uh some out of each age uh
[48:52] overcome the temptation of that age he
[48:54] says I've got the scripture here I I
[48:56] don't think we really have the time to
[48:58] make it each one of the church ages the
[49:01] same now it's just uh just like someone
[49:04] he he says as I said in the at the
[49:07] beginning you are you are born defeated
[49:11] and that birth can never bring you to
[49:14] life because you're born defeated and
[49:17] you are in a defeated World amongst
[49:21] defeated people that uh among defeated
[49:25] Creeds and defeated
[49:27] denominations you've got to come to
[49:30] Victory someway amen so so we were all
[49:34] born defeated and there's no way that
[49:36] you're going to overcome anything you
[49:39] young people will never overcome lust uh
[49:42] uh you you men will never overcome lust
[49:45] you women will never overcome lust amen
[49:47] I don't care how young how old amen you
[49:50] don't outgrow I heard someone say well
[49:52] that time comes when you outgrow it no
[49:54] you don't out grow it amen Sin is Sin
[49:58] and this nature you you you amen you'll
[50:03] never defeat the Devil in your flesh
[50:06] amen you have to be born again yes sir
[50:12] amen but what I have found in many of
[50:15] times is that amen we we uh we can live
[50:20] we allow Satan to keep us in a condemned
[50:24] state man and and as long as you are uh
[50:28] you allow the enemy to keep uh H the
[50:32] cloud over your head you will never
[50:36] defeat the enemy because the scripture
[50:38] says this is the victory that overcomes
[50:42] the world even
[50:46] condemnation amen now now you bunch of
[50:49] you said amen when you shouldn't have
[50:51] said Amen on that one there amen this is
[50:54] the victory that over cometh the world
[50:57] even
[51:00] our amen now I've got you wondering okay
[51:03] I'm going to keep my mouth shut this
[51:04] time you say even our faith you can't
[51:09] overcome with condemnation that's right
[51:12] and Satan wants to condemn you and and
[51:16] and make you feel you don't have the
[51:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost make you feel
[51:21] that you cannot overcome make you feel
[51:24] and as long as there is a question mark
[51:27] in your mind then you are Defeated come
[51:32] on well praise the Lord amen you see but
[51:37] there there's got to
[51:39] be a faith uh the power of faith that
[51:44] brings about the Overcomer an overcomer
[51:48] is an overcomer because he is confident
[51:52] that he can fight and that he can win
[51:55] amen an overcomer is not something that
[51:57] just happens an overcomer is one that
[52:00] knows who he is and and is willing to
[52:03] put everything on the line to fight that
[52:06] devil amen there's been many too many
[52:08] people that lay down to the devil
[52:11] because you feel like amen because
[52:13] you're Waring against something in your
[52:15] mind or you're Waring against something
[52:18] in your flesh amen you and and and and
[52:21] you're Waring and you're in the middle
[52:22] of a battle and then Satan talks you out
[52:26] of your weapon and you lay that weapon
[52:28] down and say well I must not be a
[52:30] Christian or I must not be a believer or
[52:33] I must not be in the Bri and Satan will
[52:35] sit there and he'll talk you out of that
[52:38] amen and you lay the weapon down a and
[52:42] just amen allow the thing to take over
[52:44] your life I'm going to tell you today
[52:47] we're in a war amen we're in a war and
[52:53] somebody's got to keep that weapon in
[52:56] your hand and defeat the enemy amen now
[53:00] listen this is the last stage of the
[53:01] journey we are in the last age this is
[53:04] the time that the power of the holy
[53:07] spirit this this this is where amen
[53:10] darkness and and light is is is coming
[53:13] to its final uh uh battle and the only
[53:17] way light will win is When the Children
[53:21] of light stand their pace and say I
[53:26] refuse to allow the enemy to win in my
[53:29] life I you may be battling here this
[53:32] morning but that don't mean amen that
[53:34] you're a part of the enemy if you've got
[53:36] a weapon in your hand keep that weapon
[53:38] in your hand if you've got a desire to
[53:41] serve God that I say this morning lift
[53:44] up that weapon and you defeat the enemy
[53:47] because the greater is he that is in you
[53:50] that he that is in the
[53:53] world Amen
[53:56] amen you've got to defeat the enemy can
[53:58] you say amen amen now he he says brother
[54:02] Brandon would say it's just like the
[54:04] Lily whereas the Lily I think is one of
[54:06] the most prettiest flowers there is I'm
[54:09] very fond of those little kala lies and
[54:12] pond lies I I I think there's nothing
[54:15] hardly as pretty as a big Pond Lily call
[54:18] it a water lily you know how it's its
[54:21] Radiance and where it he says where does
[54:24] it come from it comes from a little seed
[54:26] in the bottom of a muddy Mucky Pond and
[54:29] that little seed yet all the radiance
[54:31] that'll ever shine in it is in is in it
[54:34] right then when it's in that mud and but
[54:37] it is it it has to strive daily knowing
[54:40] that there is something it's black it's
[54:42] dirty it's Mucky amen it's slimy in that
[54:46] slime that it's living in yet it presses
[54:49] its way it presses its uh it praise the
[54:53] Lord let me get this it restes its way
[54:55] through the mud the mck the waters the
[54:58] stagnant places until it sticks its head
[55:01] above in the light and expresses what's
[55:04] been hid in it all the time I think
[55:07] that's an overcomer that was once in sin
[55:10] once did things that was wrong don't
[55:12] worry about it now once did those things
[55:15] that was wrong amen why why look back
[55:17] there in the pond again and what do you
[55:20] have see God by his predestination see
[55:23] he's brought his seed to life expressing
[55:26] itself see it come coming to life now on
[55:30] top of all that it has overcome can I
[55:33] hear a great big amen amen there will
[55:36] come a time of overcoming Hallelujah
[55:38] there will come a reward time for
[55:42] everyone who has fought the
[55:45] Battle well praise the Lord amen now now
[55:50] I know I know Hallelujah and I you know
[55:53] Israel if Israel listens to the us amen
[55:56] it'll end up surrendering its weapons
[55:58] it'll end up going right back in there
[56:00] and allowing hamus you know Hamas to
[56:03] live a a and to continue to Reign but
[56:05] but Israel if they're going to defeat
[56:08] the enemy they're going to have to
[56:09] ignore Russia they're going to have to
[56:11] ignore every other Diplomat and they're
[56:13] going to say Hamas shall never survive
[56:19] amen amen now if they're going to play
[56:21] politics uh Israel will quit fighting
[56:24] here before long and amen and allow the
[56:26] enemy to continue to live are you
[56:28] hearing me and the devil wants you to do
[56:30] the same thing I I'm not a prophet and
[56:33] I'm not saying what's going to happen
[56:34] over there we know the end product but
[56:36] I'm saying as far as you're concerned
[56:38] the enemy will try to tell you amen we
[56:41] need a ceasefire the enemy will try to
[56:43] tell you well you're taking this too far
[56:45] the enemy will tell you amen you know
[56:48] well you've done just enough I want to
[56:50] say here this morning I will not quit

[56:57] life I am not going to quit praying I am
[57:00] not going to quit believing I am not
[57:03] going to quit reading I'm not going to
[57:05] quit confessing I'm not going to quit
[57:07] preaching I'm not going to quit
[57:09] testifying I'm going to defeat the enemy
[57:13] because I'm anointed to do so do I have
[57:15] anyone that's anointed to do so here
[57:17] today amen Satan you can't talk me out
[57:21] of it you can't turn me around you have
[57:23] pushed me too far you have pushed my
[57:26] family too far you have defeated in too
[57:29] many cases I will

[57:45] to defeat the
[57:47] enemy that's right

[57:58] problem you've got to overcome in the
[58:01] bottom of that
[58:02] pond
[58:03] Hallelujah and it's put there by
[58:06] predestination now he says it doesn't
[58:09] Express itself down there it's getting
[58:12] up to express itself neither did you and
[58:14] your sin or adultery and everything you
[58:17] lived in you didn't Express nothing but
[58:20] there was a seed in there and it's got a
[58:23] chance to PR itself into life and now
[58:27] you're in the presence of Jesus Christ
[58:29] with the sunlight and it's brought out
[58:31] what what you really was in the
[58:34] beginning and you you see what I mean
[58:36] you saw the light you believed God you
[58:40] laid your heart open and now you're a
[58:42] lily you remember my sermon on the Lily
[58:45] Reverend Lily how he toiled and and and
[58:48] yet he did not spin H yet Solomon in all
[58:51] of his glory is not a raid like one of
[58:54] these

[58:57] nothing for himself the Lily don't care
[59:00] nothing about himself what does he do he
[59:03] throws his Beauty out his life out that
[59:06] others may see his life is expressed out
[59:11] that others might see the glory what's
[59:14] in him that was in him in that mud see
[59:17] now he's on the top that's the Overcomer
[59:20] he overcome the mud he overcome the
[59:23] things of the world and now he freely
[59:26] gives himself out everybody can look at
[59:30] him his life you can't put a finger on
[59:32] him he's a real Overcomer amen you can't
[59:34] you can't say nothing about him now you
[59:36] say he came out of the mud but he's not
[59:39] in the mud now he's on top of it amen
[59:42] you can't pinpoint back what he was what
[59:45] is he now he is on the top well somebody
[59:49] shout
[59:50] hallelujah amen there's coming a Time
[59:53] Victory days coming coming where you can
[59:55] no longer point of me in the pond but
[59:59] you're going to see that I'm on top of
[1:00:01] the
[1:00:02] pond you know why because there's
[1:00:05] something on the inside of me that says
[1:00:07] I shall
[1:00:10] Prevail amen hallelujah now when you're
[1:00:14] born again amen there's those two laws
[1:00:17] that lay on the inside of you there was
[1:00:20] a question that was given to brother
[1:00:21] brandham concerning uh Romans 7:14 18 we
[1:00:25] know that the law is is is spiritual and
[1:00:28] I am carnal so under sin for that which
[1:00:31] I would
[1:00:32] do for what I would I that I would not
[1:00:36] and what I hate that I do if then I do
[1:00:40] that which is good uh or if I do that
[1:00:43] which I would not uh brother bram's
[1:00:46] reading this it says unto the law
[1:00:48] consent to the law that it is good uh
[1:00:51] now then it is no more I that doeth it
[1:00:54] but sin that dwelleth in me and then it
[1:00:56] says I cannot understand this I cannot
[1:00:59] understand now brother Brandon would
[1:01:00] give his interpretation as well they
[1:01:02] wrote out the scripture uh that's Paul
[1:01:04] speaking in Romans let me just kind of
[1:01:06] Polish it up so you can see it he says
[1:01:08] in me is two persons right one wants me
[1:01:12] uh right one wants me to do wrong the
[1:01:15] other wants me to do and every time that
[1:01:17] I start to do right then wrong hinders
[1:01:19] me how many of you people on the
[1:01:20] interviews this afternoon has run the
[1:01:22] same thing in this morning the same
[1:01:25] thing as I spoke on this morning
[1:01:28] temporarily you're an outward man which
[1:01:30] is controlled by six senses you're an
[1:01:33] inward man controlled by one sense which
[1:01:35] is Faith and this Faith disagrees with
[1:01:38] the all the uh all the six senses in the
[1:01:41] six senses doesn't agree with faith but
[1:01:44] one con one is contrary to the other and
[1:01:48] now as long as the six senses agree with
[1:01:50] faith that's wonderful but when the six
[1:01:53] senses disagrees with Faith then leave
[1:01:55] the six senses alone for for instance
[1:01:58] Jesus made a statement a promise the
[1:02:00] inside man says that's true the outside
[1:02:03] man reasons that it cannot be true then
[1:02:06] ignore the outside man and accept the
[1:02:10] inside man amen well praise the Lord
[1:02:15] amen now now he's giv us some pointers
[1:02:17] here Amen to to the overcoming Satan is
[1:02:21] going to be right there troubling you
[1:02:24] he's going to be right there pushing
[1:02:27] your
[1:02:28] buttons and if he can talk you out of
[1:02:31] your weapon amen you'll let's lay your
[1:02:32] weapon down and say well amen I thought
[1:02:35] I was an overcomer but now you know
[1:02:37] here's these thoughts or I can't believe
[1:02:40] that oh my goodness I a no you stand
[1:02:43] right there Toe to Toe with the
[1:02:46] Enemy amen praise the Lord amen you've
[1:02:51] got to do it can you say Amen there's a
[1:02:53] difference there's a difference in a in
[1:02:56] in in in in a pig and a sheep there's a
[1:02:59] difference in desire amen but just
[1:03:01] because the Sheep has has a different
[1:03:03] nature of a pig does not mean that the
[1:03:06] that the Sheep does not get dirty does
[1:03:08] not get muddy does not go through the
[1:03:11] can you say
[1:03:12] Amen man but it's that word that lays on
[1:03:15] the inside of you that soul will stay
[1:03:18] with the word of God every time amen
[1:03:22] that soul will stand right up and say no
[1:03:25] amen I'm going to stand for what God
[1:03:27] says can you say amen he says now he
[1:03:30] says the same thing that Paul's speaking
[1:03:31] of he was sold under the law to carnal
[1:03:35] sin every one of us is the same that's
[1:03:38] the reason we we have the troubles we do
[1:03:40] married four or five times this and that
[1:03:42] all kinds of sins and adulteries and
[1:03:44] everything else along in our lives is
[1:03:46] because of those things we're carnal but
[1:03:49] and that part must perish but then
[1:03:52] inside we're a spirit man the soul
[1:03:54] inside that's faith in God's word and
[1:03:57] then we bring our outside body in
[1:04:00] subjection to the word by faith
[1:04:03] accepting what God Said how can I take a
[1:04:06] Cocker and and and and make a grain of
[1:04:09] wheat out of it it's impossible for me
[1:04:11] to do the only way that I can I it can
[1:04:14] be is because inside the Cocker has been
[1:04:18] transmitted a a cckar wheat uh from a
[1:04:21] cockabur uh uh wheat to a germ called
[1:04:25] wheat life and then you bury that Cocker
[1:04:29] it'll produce the grain of wheat that's
[1:04:31] right see because there has been a life
[1:04:34] of wheat put in the Cocker the life of
[1:04:38] the Cocker has been taken out but the
[1:04:41] nature of the cckar is still sticky see
[1:04:44] and it will be until this new life has
[1:04:47] been fully developed out of the ground
[1:04:49] and raised up when it comes forth amen
[1:04:52] it'll be no more Cocker but but wheat
[1:04:54] but while it's on Earth and in out of
[1:04:58] the earth a a Cocker is still Cocker
[1:05:01] it's still sticky it's got the nature on
[1:05:03] the inside of Wheat and as long as
[1:05:05] you're in this life you're going to be
[1:05:07] sticky and have a carnal nature and
[1:05:10] that's going to bother you as long as
[1:05:12] you live but on the inside of you you're
[1:05:15] born again and when you're raised up
[1:05:18] you're in the likeness of Christ and all
[1:05:21] the sin is gone from you and that's the
[1:05:24] thing can you say amen amen so so we
[1:05:28] live here in this in this body this
[1:05:31] defeated body amen this body is defeated
[1:05:35] there's no way you can paint it up
[1:05:37] there's no way you can Church it up
[1:05:39] there's no way you can can you say amen
[1:05:41] amen the only way you're going to bring
[1:05:43] anything about this body under control
[1:05:46] is through the soul that is on the
[1:05:48] inside of you that's the only way and
[1:05:51] that's what the holy spirit is for amen
[1:05:53] that's what the scripture says about the
[1:05:56] about your uh you know uh your words
[1:05:59] amen they say that you could you can
[1:06:00] train a ship you could amen you could
[1:06:03] you with a Rudder you can you can move
[1:06:05] things amen and control horses with a
[1:06:08] bit but he says but the mouth is
[1:06:11] something that just cannot be tamed amen
[1:06:14] why because there amen here we here we
[1:06:17] live in this body amen here we live in
[1:06:20] this carnal nature here we can you say
[1:06:22] Amen I'm the all of man is where the
[1:06:26] Holy Ghost
[1:06:29] lives and the Holy Ghost must take
[1:06:33] authority of that flesh amen hallelujah
[1:06:39] now if it's your nature amen and you
[1:06:42] love sin and you love gambling and you
[1:06:45] love adultery and you love those kinds
[1:06:48] of things amen well I'm going to tell
[1:06:51] you there ain't nothing Temptation about
[1:06:53] that that's who you
[1:06:54] are come on come on that that's who you
[1:06:58] are that's what you want to do you amen
[1:07:00] you love line and you amen and you'll
[1:07:02] Justified you love wearing your pants
[1:07:05] and you Justified you love those things
[1:07:08] and you'll Justified it's because your
[1:07:10] Nature has not been changed but if
[1:07:13] you've got the power of the holy spirit
[1:07:15] that has given you a new birth and the
[1:07:18] power of an unlimited God has
[1:07:21] transformed that soul amen then there's
[1:07:25] something that rises up and says I
[1:07:28] disagree with that mind I disagree with
[1:07:32] what this flesh is telling me I disagree
[1:07:35] well can you say amen amen I'm going to
[1:07:38] overcome somebody say I'm an overcomer
[1:07:42] I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer amen
[1:07:45] not because it's here I'm an overcomer
[1:07:48] because I've been born again by the
[1:07:50] power of the Holy Ghost and there's no
[1:07:54] weapon that is formed against me that is
[1:07:56] going to prosper I shall I shall I shall
[1:08:02] overcome the evil one in my
[1:08:08] life and you see
[1:08:10] man
[1:08:12] amen you've got the two
[1:08:16] laws amen that are war in you praise the
[1:08:20] Lord you got the enemy
[1:08:24] amen and remember you weren't supposed
[1:08:27] to you weren't supposed to have this
[1:08:30] carnal nature that you're dealing with
[1:08:32] and when you get on the other side
[1:08:34] there's where we're going to be
[1:08:37] free it'll be the same Soul without the
[1:08:40] carnal
[1:08:43] nature can you imagine coming to church
[1:08:46] with no carnal nature can you imagine
[1:08:49] being able to worship God Before the
[1:08:51] Throne without condemnation can you
[1:08:54] imagine being able to come a oh come on
[1:08:57] church that's what's going to be there
[1:08:59] amen as you come to church here this
[1:09:01] morning you're Before the Throne of God
[1:09:03] Amen the only thing that's see hindering
[1:09:05] you from seeing God's throne here this
[1:09:07] morning is your carnal eyes your carnal
[1:09:10] feelings uh your carnal emotions but
[1:09:13] when that body takes on Hallelujah when
[1:09:17] that Soul takes on a glorified body we
[1:09:21] will see him as he is
[1:09:26] hall
[1:09:28] hallelujah
[1:09:30] amen now Jesus says I want you to
[1:09:33] watch and I want you to
[1:09:36] pray Mark 14 and
[1:09:39] 38 lest you enter into
[1:09:45] temptation the spirit truly is really is
[1:09:49] ready but the
[1:09:51] flesh is weak
[1:09:55] now I want you to be
[1:09:56] careful I want you to
[1:09:59] watch you're going to have to be
[1:10:01] diligent
[1:10:04] here because temptation's
[1:10:11] coming well praise the
[1:10:14] Lord
[1:10:16] amen
[1:10:17] now Jesus experienced
[1:10:20] it
[1:10:22] amen and
[1:10:24] and I'm looking for the I'm looking for
[1:10:27] the
[1:10:28] scripture
[1:10:31] Hallelujah Jesus there is
[1:10:33] he's going to
[1:10:38] Calvary by Revelation he knows that he's
[1:10:40] got to
[1:10:41] Die the plan of God is unfolded before
[1:10:46] him he tells his disciples there in Luke
[1:10:49] 22 and 39 he's he's letting them know
[1:10:53] that temptation is
[1:10:55] coming and you've got to cover yourself
[1:10:57] with
[1:10:59] prayer so that you amen are not overcome
[1:11:04] with
[1:11:06] temptation Luke 22:39 he come out and
[1:11:09] went
[1:11:10] and as he was want to the Mount of
[1:11:13] Olives and his disciples also followed
[1:11:16] him and when he was at that place at the
[1:11:19] place he said unto them pray ye pray
[1:11:22] that ye enter not into
[1:11:25] temptation and he was withdrawn from
[1:11:27] them about a stone's Thro cast and kneel
[1:11:31] down and prayed and saying
[1:11:34] father if thou be
[1:11:36] willing remove this cup from
[1:11:39] me nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:11:43] done now now the scripture says that he
[1:11:46] was in in great Agony if you were to
[1:11:48] read there in the Book of Matthew it
[1:11:51] says that he was in great
[1:11:54] Agony agonizing asking God to take this
[1:12:00] hour from him his
[1:12:04] flesh he had the Holy
[1:12:07] Ghost but he was
[1:12:11] agonizing he was the very God in flesh
[1:12:16] and yet that fles was in
[1:12:20] agonizing that's right come on
[1:12:24] I don't want to go through
[1:12:27] this if it's your will let this C pass
[1:12:31] from me on on come on
[1:12:35] Church did that did that reduce him from
[1:12:38] being the Son of God did that reduce him
[1:12:41] from the Having the Holy Ghost on the
[1:12:43] inside of
[1:12:47] him man the Apostle Paul says in the
[1:12:51] days of his flesh he was troubled
[1:12:56] sore he was
[1:12:58] perplexed he was huren he was in
[1:13:03] agony
[1:13:05] Temptation was upon him
[1:13:10] yeah but he went to
[1:13:14] prayer and Jesus is telling them you
[1:13:17] need to go to
[1:13:19] prayer that you be not overcome with the
[1:13:23] temp
[1:13:24] ation and the scripture says that Jesus
[1:13:26] went to prayer and as he was praying
[1:13:31] amen he he said man father this 42nd
[1:13:35] verse father if it be willing remove
[1:13:37] this cup from me nevertheless not my
[1:13:38] will but thine be will be done and there
[1:13:41] appeared an angel unto him from Heaven
[1:13:45] strengthening
[1:13:48] him he's he's he's facing the temptation
[1:13:52] of his life
[1:13:54] and in order to fight he goes to
[1:13:58] prayer in order to fight he goes to
[1:14:02] prayer and he's asking God I I don't
[1:14:06] want to go through with this but yet I'm
[1:14:09] willing to surrender my will to you and
[1:14:12] then an angel appears unto him
[1:14:16] amen from Heaven strengthening him and
[1:14:19] being in agony he prayed more earnestly
[1:14:22] and his sweat as it were uh a drop grape
[1:14:25] jocks of blood falling down to the
[1:14:28] ground and when he rose from prayer and
[1:14:31] was come to his disciples he found them
[1:14:34] sleeping for sorrow and he said why
[1:14:37] sleep you rise and pray lest you enter
[1:14:43] into
[1:14:48] temptation now we understand that they
[1:14:51] succumb to the Temptation we understand
[1:14:53] that they were defeated by the
[1:14:56] Temptation they all forsook him what can
[1:14:59] you say
[1:15:00] man now amen but when they go to the
[1:15:05] upper room and they are filled with the
[1:15:08] power of the Holy Ghost we find that
[1:15:10] there is something else that comes well
[1:15:13] can you say Amen so when Jesus is saying
[1:15:16] there in Mark 14 and 38 watch ye and
[1:15:18] pray lest you be overcome with
[1:15:22] temptation for the spirit is truly
[1:15:25] willing truly ready but the flesh is
[1:15:30] weak
[1:15:32] winning requires
[1:15:35] diligence
[1:15:36] now are you are y'all hearing I'm I'm
[1:15:38] talking to Holy Ghost filled people here
[1:15:40] this morning winning requires
[1:15:43] diligence amen what are you feeding are
[1:15:46] you feeding your caral man no wonder you
[1:15:48] can't
[1:15:49] overcome for you will reap what you sow
[1:15:52] when you you sold to this flesh you
[1:15:55] shall of the flesh reap
[1:15:58] corruption but if you soow unto the
[1:16:01] spirit you shall of the spirit reap amen
[1:16:05] of eternal life that's right can you say
[1:16:08] amen amen so it's in it's in your it's
[1:16:11] in your hands Paul is talking to the
[1:16:14] church says now you want to se under
[1:16:17] corruption amen then so if you want to
[1:16:19] reap corruption then sew into the
[1:16:21] flesh now if it's it's it's it's quite
[1:16:24] an amazing thing that brother Brenham
[1:16:27] says the amen the pressure of this age
[1:16:31] is soft living easy and soft living
[1:16:36] that's the pressure of this age and
[1:16:40] that's how the enemy is is defeating the
[1:16:44] H uh the the church today is because of
[1:16:48] the the the Easy Living amen well praise
[1:16:52] the Lord I don't care who you are amen

[1:17:03] pillow amen and I don't care if your bed
[1:17:06] is a hundred years old amen it's better
[1:17:08] than what they had in back in the early
[1:17:11] church praise the Lord amen I don't care
[1:17:14] what it is amen you when when when
[1:17:16] you're going blind you can wear glasses

[1:17:23] you you need another car you can you can
[1:17:25] get a car and if you ain't got a car you
[1:17:27] can get a taxi or somebody to help you
[1:17:30] well come on Church we're living in the
[1:17:32] age of soft living this is easy living
[1:17:34] this is soft
[1:17:36] living and because of the softness that
[1:17:39] we're living in it's taken away the
[1:17:43] drive to overcome that's right
[1:17:47] that's praise the
[1:17:49] Lord amen what are you feeding well
[1:17:53] brother Wendell I don't I don't do
[1:17:54] anything I I amen hallelujah but you're

[1:18:04] in service this morning but leave when
[1:18:05] you leave the building and see amen look
[1:18:08] up on your memory and see how much time
[1:18:10] you spent per day on that phone this
[1:18:13] week just this week hallelujah look look
[1:18:16] see what you've got on that phone amen
[1:18:19] see how many hours per day is spent on
[1:18:23] that phone am amen you know what you're
[1:18:26] feeding you're feeding the
[1:18:31] flesh you used to go on shopping binges
[1:18:34] once a week or once every two weeks you
[1:18:36] used to now you're shopping every day
[1:18:38] hours a
[1:18:40] day and you wonder why you can't
[1:18:43] overcome well praise the
[1:18:46] Lord
[1:18:48] hallelujah you've got to feed on the
[1:18:51] right things in
[1:18:54] order to overcome in this
[1:18:58] age brother brandham gave the
[1:19:01] illustration amen about a a Native
[1:19:05] American amen uh uh I believe he was an
[1:19:08] Apache who had received the Holy Ghost
[1:19:10] he was converted and he said someone
[1:19:13] asked him how are you getting along and
[1:19:15] he said pretty good and pretty bad he
[1:19:19] said well now how do you mean by pretty
[1:19:21] good and pretty bad
[1:19:23] he saidwell since me received the Holy
[1:19:26] Ghost there's been two dogs in me one of
[1:19:29] them's a black dog and one of them is a
[1:19:31] white dog he said they argue all the
[1:19:35] time they growl and fight at one
[1:19:38] another the white dog wants me to do
[1:19:41] good the black dog wants me to do
[1:19:43] bad and the man said well Chief which
[1:19:46] one of them wins the
[1:19:48] fight he said depends on which one Chief
[1:19:51] feeds the most
[1:19:53] so brother bradam says so I think that's
[1:19:56] a good answer here see there just
[1:20:00] depends on the wiring of the body that's
[1:20:03] in you and it depends on which one you
[1:20:06] cater to which nature you cater to the
[1:20:09] carnal nature after the things of the
[1:20:11] world or the spiritual nature of the
[1:20:13] things of God that does it now Brothers
[1:20:16] there's where we're at and there's where

[1:25:56] feeding the white dog that's
[1:26:00] right and because of soft
[1:26:04] living and because our agenda is so big
[1:26:09] listen 70 years
[1:26:11] ago women didn't leave their
[1:26:14] houses they stayed there and took care
[1:26:16] of their
[1:26:18] children they prayed for their
[1:26:21] husbands they didn't have all of this
[1:26:23] other stuff going on all the
[1:26:27] time brother Ram talks about about
[1:26:30] Susanne Wesley
[1:26:32] raising what 10 11
[1:26:36] kids and she would have to walk a mile
[1:26:39] every day just to get her
[1:26:43] water but they say history says that she
[1:26:46] prayed two and three hours a day for her
[1:26:51] children and It produced a John Wesley
[1:26:53] and a Charles
[1:26:55] Wesley there was a sense of
[1:27:00] responsibility to

[1:27:36] backbone of the
[1:27:40] home he said Satan has got the women out

[1:27:54] time for
[1:27:55] prayer now there's no time amen there's
[1:27:59] no time for the children to ever hear
[1:28:02] anyone interceding for their souls and

[1:28:07] Ghost and tell our children all they
[1:28:09] know is just coming to church amen
[1:28:11] that's really the only prayer they ever
[1:28:13] hear amen of someone saying it behind
[1:28:15] the pulpit because we can't even pray
[1:28:16] even before church anymore we can't even
[1:28:19] pray during an altar service anymore

[1:40:17] their image behold their image and amen
[1:40:21] the Apostle Paul picks it up there in
[1:40:23] the book of Ephesians 5 and
[1:40:26] 24 n where it says you know therefore as
[1:40:29] the church is subject to Christ so let
[1:40:32] the wives be subject to their own
[1:40:34] husbands and amen husbands love your
[1:40:37] wives even as Christ has loved the
[1:40:39] church and gave himself for it and then
[1:40:42] it goes on down I believe to the 25th
[1:40:45] verse to the 26th verse amen where it
[1:40:48] talks about how he gave him self for it
[1:40:53] that he might sanctify it with the
[1:40:57] washing of
[1:40:59] Water by the word and there's a reason
[1:41:03] that he's doing this he's he's referring
[1:41:05] back he's referring back to the Waters
[1:41:08] of Separation he's referring back to
[1:41:11] that to that labor he amen that Brazen
[1:41:14] labor that's where amen that the Brazen
[1:41:16] altar is see judged and amen has been
[1:41:19] put on that lamb and now we're taking

[1:48:30] promises let me let me let me just look
[1:48:32] here let's just let's just see what the
[1:48:34] scripture says First Corinthians
[1:48:37] 7:1 having
[1:48:39] therefore these promises dearly
[1:48:42] beloved let us cleanse 2 Corinthians
[1:48:47] 7:1 having therefore these promises
[1:48:51] dearly beloved let us
[1:48:54] cleanse
[1:48:57] ourselves
[1:48:58] from all
[1:49:01] filthiness of the Flesh and spirit
[1:49:06] perfecting Holiness in the fear of
[1:49:11] God having these
[1:49:14] promises what promises the Divine
[1:49:17] promise of eternal life through the
[1:49:21] baptism of the Holy
[1:49:22] Ghost having these promises Brethren let
[1:49:27] us well glory to God
[1:49:30] cleanse cleanse you can take the word
[1:49:33] and you can cleanse you can walk you can
[1:49:37] wash that garment you can I know what
[1:49:39] Satan is trying to do I know what he's
[1:49:41] trying to say I know well praise the
[1:49:44] Lord Amplified says therefore since
[1:49:46] these great promises are ours beloved
[1:49:49] let let us cleanse ourselves from
[1:49:51] everything that contaminates and defiles
[1:49:53] the body and spirit and bring our
[1:49:55] consecration to completeness in the
[1:49:58] reverential fear of God can you say Amen
[1:50:02] perfecting Holiness perfecting Holiness
[1:50:04] what does perfect mean accomplish
[1:50:06] execute complete to take upon oneself to
[1:50:09] make an end for oneself to appoint to to
[1:50:12] oppose upon in other words amen I am
[1:50:16] going to accomplish Holiness I am going
[1:50:19] to execute and complete I will defeat
[1:50:23] that enemy amen oh you can come at me
[1:50:26] you can come at me one way but you're
[1:50:28] going to go in seven ways you can come
[1:50:30] and and and try to come against my
[1:50:32] family but I'm here to tell you I've got
[1:50:35] nuclear weapons I'm going to take that
[1:50:37] weapon of faith I'm going to stand Toe
[1:50:40] to Toe I am going to defeat you so help
[1:50:43] me
[1:50:46] God can you say amen amen he'll tell you
[1:50:50] you preachers that you're not preachers
[1:50:51] stand up and say you're a liar and we'll
[1:50:54] tell you m you're not believer stand up
[1:50:57] and say you're a liar he'll tell you
[1:50:59] daddies that you're not an overcomer
[1:51:01] stand up resist him and say I shall
[1:51:06] defeat
[1:51:15] you
[1:51:17] now Paul gives
[1:51:25] he gives an example there in First
[1:51:28] Corinthians
[1:51:30] 10 he's talking about a lot of examples
[1:51:33] of
[1:51:36] unbelief
[1:51:38] and but then he's also talking to the
[1:51:40] elect and he 12th verse he says
[1:51:44] wherefore let him thinketh that he
[1:51:48] stands take key lest he
[1:51:53] falls
[1:51:56] okay so the mentality that says I've
[1:52:06] arrived might
[1:52:08] show your lack of spiritual
[1:52:14] perception because you're never going to
[1:52:16] arrive in this body
[1:52:20] come
[1:52:21] on you're never going to
[1:52:25] arrive I believe that we'll come to the
[1:52:27] unity of faith I believe that we'll come
[1:52:28] to that point I believe that we there
[1:52:30] will come that point at the rapturing of
[1:52:31] the church I believe that but
[1:52:39] brother praise the
[1:52:42] Lord I'm not one that
[1:52:45] beli that when you receive the Holy
[1:52:48] Ghost you're immune from
[1:52:51] sin that's
[1:52:57] right if you're immune from sin then you
[1:52:59] don't need the blood of Jesus
[1:53:04] anymore but I'm here to tell you let him
[1:53:07] that thinks that he stands take heed
[1:53:10] lest he falls Amen in other words
[1:53:13] there's no room for arrogancy
[1:53:16] here there's no
[1:53:18] room we got to stand stand upon the word
[1:53:22] of God and great humility if there's
[1:53:24] ever a time for humility I believe that
[1:53:26] church I believe this last day bride
[1:53:28] will be one of profound humility a
[1:53:32] humbleness a humbleness that is looking
[1:53:34] to him and never to himself a humbleness
[1:53:37] that is saying Lord I need you a
[1:53:39] humbleness that say that'll never stay
[1:53:41] well I can handle it now you'll never
[1:53:43] handle

[2:00:15] also make a way of Escape that you may
[2:00:18] be able to be it he's not telling you
[2:00:21] that you're going to take you out of the

[2:01:11] and6 but
[2:01:14] godliness with Tempt with
[2:01:18] contentment is great
[2:01:20] gain godliness somebody say
[2:01:25] godliness to be like
[2:01:28] God to reflect
[2:01:31] him to have his
[2:01:34] approval and to be content with
[2:01:37] that is great
[2:01:42] game for we brought nothing into this
[2:01:44] world and it is certain we can carry
[2:01:47] nothing out I heard a message preacher
[2:01:49] tell me one time of another of another
[2:01:51] family another he said
[2:01:55] wow I've been to college and I've done
[2:01:57] this and I've provided for my family
[2:02:00] and you look at that man and he's never
[2:02:03] had no ambition to do anything he just
[2:02:05] worked at a little clunky job he's not
[2:02:08] done much of anything and he's just a
[2:02:10] bum has nothing now he can't take care
[2:02:13] of himself and can't take care of this
[2:02:14] and can't take care of that
[2:02:17] and
[2:02:23] and I'm looking at this message preacher
[2:02:25] that's telling me this and I'm thinking
[2:02:29] y where's the spirituality for your
[2:02:33] children where are they
[2:02:35] at this man chose the right
[2:02:39] thing
[2:02:41] yeah he might not have
[2:02:44] everything but he worked hard he worked
[2:02:46] hard for his family worked hard for his
[2:02:49] wife he wasn't lazy he went to
[2:02:52] work he might not have made made money
[2:02:55] like
[2:02:56] you might not have known how to invest
[2:02:59] like
[2:03:03] you might not have the
[2:03:05] smarts like
[2:03:08] you but in my thoughts I'm
[2:03:15] thinking while you're making fun of that
[2:03:17] dude you're making fun of me cuz that's
[2:03:18] really the way I sort of operate
[2:03:25] too I want to please the
[2:03:29] Lord nothing wrong with money in the
[2:03:31] bank not a thing wrong I I Hallelujah we
[2:03:35] all should be good
[2:03:38] Savers but it's not in the what's in
[2:03:40] your bank and it's not the kind of money
[2:03:41] you make you can get out there make all
[2:03:44] kinds of
[2:03:46] money and be a numb skull spiritually
[2:03:50] that's
[2:03:51] right so numb you don't even notice your
[2:03:54] own family you don't even notice that
[2:03:55] you're not walking with God you can't
[2:03:57] even see in your own heart that you're
[2:03:59] not you you there's no burning deep down

[2:07:05] Ghost don't let the devil take that
[2:07:07] weapon away from

[2:07:16] spirit because you're
[2:07:27] Overcomer you're big in God's
[2:07:31] eyes he's already taken the picture of
[2:07:36] you the picture he has of you that
[2:07:39] Christ is interceding
[2:07:43] for it's not your bad he's not
[2:07:45] interceding for your bad he's not
[2:07:46] interceding for your sin he's not
[2:07:48] interceding for none of that he is ex he
[2:07:49] is interceding for God's word there is a
[2:07:53] predestinated seat on the inside of you
[2:07:57] and he is interceding for that
[2:08:04] seed he's representing you you are in
[2:08:08] the mind of
[2:08:17] God
[2:08:19] I don't know if you feel the anointing
[2:08:20] out there but I feel it up
[2:08:23] here and I say boo

[2:08:33] man boo
[2:08:43] devil he says now as the musicians come

[2:08:50] body in the domain of that Kingdom one
[2:08:52] spiritual baptism no matter how good how
[2:08:55] bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by
[2:08:57] the Holy by Holy Ghost
[2:08:59] baptism that's the only way you'll
[2:09:02] overcome it's all that is under the
[2:09:04] blood the shed blood is Overcomers
[2:09:07] because you can't overcome yourself it's
[2:09:10] he that overcome for you and you're
[2:09:11] resting how do I know then brother
[2:09:13] brandom that I'm in there what kind of
[2:09:16] life you're living just look around
[2:09:18] around see if it's just lived out of you
[2:09:21] automatically or do you have to strain
[2:09:23] and Pull and then you're doing then
[2:09:25] you're doing it but don't try to do it
[2:09:29] just like putting a little baby's arm in
[2:09:31] a sleeve
[2:09:32] hole he's just up and down and over and
[2:09:35] everywhere else and he can't do it put
[2:09:36] on your coat honey he can't do it little
[2:09:39] arms up and down and around and it takes
[2:09:41] your Steady Hand and oh how glad I am
[2:09:45] that I can just yield my hand to the
[2:09:48] father father and say Lord Jesus I can't
[2:09:51] get it in there but you help
[2:09:54] me you put the coat on me and I'll quit
[2:09:57] trying just let him do it and if the
[2:10:00] little baby keeps trying and saying oh I
[2:10:03] can do it I can do it he's just
[2:10:05] everywhere he can't do it neither can
[2:10:07] you neither can I but if we just hold
[2:10:09] still and let him and just yield to him
[2:10:13] here Lord here I
[2:10:16] am just let me be nothing I yield I put
[2:10:20] my hand in the right place that's the
[2:10:23] victory that's the
[2:10:26] overcoming the thing you have to
[2:10:28] overcome is yourself your ideas your
[2:10:31] things surrender
[2:10:33] yourselves to
[2:10:35] him but he's over come for you he knows
[2:10:38] the
[2:10:43] way can you say
[2:10:47] man
[2:10:49] we want to live in that
[2:10:58] right it's the life of God in
[2:11:03] you now you say well brother brandom
[2:11:05] says if there's no struggle if you're
[2:11:08] bucking there's a difference in a
[2:11:10] fighting the enemy and bucking the
[2:11:15] system if you're bucking the word of God
[2:11:17] you need the Holy
[2:11:27] Ghost but most holy ghost filled
[2:11:29] Christians that I know of want to serve
[2:11:31] God their
[2:11:33] desire is in line with the word of
[2:11:38] God but it's the
[2:11:41] enemy it wants to pull them this way and
[2:11:43] that way and they're not off the hook
[2:11:46] they're not off the hook
[2:11:51] you're not off the hook if you're not
[2:11:53] overcoming you ain't going in a
[2:12:01] Rapture God's giving you that Holy Ghost
[2:12:04] to overcome with that's
[2:12:09] right but I'm telling
[2:12:13] you don't be asking for a weapon if he's
[2:12:15] already given it to
