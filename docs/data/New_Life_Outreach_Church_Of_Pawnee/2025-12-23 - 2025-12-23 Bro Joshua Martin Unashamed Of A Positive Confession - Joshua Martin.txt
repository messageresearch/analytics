As we get ready to go to prayer, we don't have any written request, but like to remember um brother Patrick, sister Staca, uh they're in the hospital now. Last time I heard she's a six. And so I know they're excited. That's where mom and dad is. They're up there with them tonight. So let's just remember them that the Lord would just keep his hands upon them tonight. and my wife hasn't been feeling good the last few days and the only reason she's here tonight is because of the medication that she has. So, let's remember her as well. Uh if there's any other needs, Brother Robert's not here. Um Sister Tibbetha's still in Kansas. Let's remember on her way back, so let's just ask the Lord to keep his hands upon her. If there's any other needs upon your heart, just make it known by the lifting of your hand. And brother John, would you mind leading us in prayer here tonight? Amen. Amen. Dear heavenly father, Lord, we come before you tonight. Father, we we love you. We're thankful that you promised that you'd be with us, Lord. So, we know you're here, Father. And Lord, while we're in your presence, we'd like to ask you to touch all the ones that are feeling bad or sick, Lord, or anything that they have on their hearts and minds. Lord, I ask you just to come down and touch that need, Lord. And Lord, our precious brother and sister that's in the hospital having a baby. Lord, there's there's nothing like new life coming into the world. I know you blessed us to have five, Lord. And and Lord, we're so thankful for every one of them. So Lord, I know they'll be thankful, too. So Lord, we ask you to go and help them and let it be quick and good and relatively easy, Lord. We ask that, Father. And the ones that are traveling, Lord, we ask you to keep your hand on them, Father. And Lord, we put this service into your hand for we're looking forward to hearing your word, Father. We're looking forward to hearing what you have to say to us, God. So Lord, we hand this service over to you, Father. We thank you. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Thank you. Appreciate you. Can we sing this as the man of God comes? Because of who you are, I give you glory. And because of who you are, I give you praise. And because of who you are, I will lift my voice and say, "Lord, I worship you because of who you are." Lord, I worship you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Can we sing that again now? because of who you are and because oh my he's been so good to us. Yes, Lord. And because of who you are, I give you praise.

Oh, Jehovah Gyra, my proider, Jehovah near Lord. You reign in victory. Jehovah Shalom, my prince of peace. And I worship you because of who you are, Lord. I worship you because of who you are. Amen. Do you have a praise upon your lips this this evening? Has he been good to you? I believe that we can all testify of the goodness of God and what he's done in our individual lives. He would save us, justify us, sanctify us, fill us with the Holy Ghost, and just incredible what what the Lord has done in all of our journeys and what he's continued to going to do for us as we walk our our path of life. Amen. But it's you happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening. It's good to see Brother Joe and Sister Stephanie. Man, we sure have been missing them around here. It's so good so good to see y'all. I'm sure y'all are getting settled in and and everything there there in Louisiana. It's so good to good to have y'all with us here tonight. But if you would have your Bibles, let's open our scriptures to Mark 8 and38. Amen. I know we we have a few out tonight, but where two or three are gathered in his name, he promised to be in our midst. And are you thankful for that promise? &gt;&gt; Amen. It don't matter the the crowd size or the the amount of people that's here, the Lord can still speak and touch hearts. Amen. I had some wisdom teeth pulled Thursday. And so, if uh hopefully I don't pull those stitches here tonight. So, just pray pray for me and and we'll we'll preach and and trust the Lord to keep us through it. Amen. But Mark 8:38, "Whosoever there therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with holy angels." Amen. Can we bow our heads this evening? Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, how humbled we are by your presence we feel here this evening, Lord. God, we ask that you would just take preeminence in their service. Father, we lay lay ourselves aside, Lord. We lay aside our thoughts and and Lord, our our ideas and our motives, Father. And we ask that you would just have preeminence here among us, Lord. You know the needs and the hearts of the people that is here tonight, Father. We ask that the word as it would come forth. May it be anointed, Father, and inspired here. Father, we ask that you would just be pleased here among us. Be with Patrick and Staca. Father, we ask that you your angels just be around them, Lord. Give a peace, Father, and may everything just go smoothly and may it go easily, Father. God, we're thankful for your grace and your mercy in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated here tonight. I just I have a simple thought, but it would be unashamed of a positive confession. These are some things that I have been just just studying on in in my de personal devotion. So I I pray it's a blessing to you here tonight. But here Jesus would say, "Whosoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, I'll be ashamed of him." And brother Brandham, he would preach a message on this scripture called ashamed. And he would say, you notice there was so much of that today, especially on the subject that I'm speaking of, ashamed of the word. Now he and the word are the same. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. The same yesterday, today and forever. So whosoever is ashamed of me and my words and he and the his word are one. So being ashamed of his word in this sinful present generation, I'll be ashamed of him. So, brother Brandham, he would put this as a a present tense scripture, not something of the past or something that's going to come, but he would put it that this is the evil and wicked and adulterous generation that that Christ is talking about. And and and we're living in the day where where it's hard to be satisfied with something. And brother Brandham would would preach the message ashamed and would say it's to be ashamed is to be embarrassed. And we would know if you're embarrassed of something, you're not necessarily satisfied with it. And we're living in a society where nobody is satisfied. You know, if you you have a blue car, there's a green car you can have. Or you have a white car, there's a black car you can have. If if you don't like the way you look, you can you can dye your hair. You can pull some teeth. You can you can do do whatever it is. And you can change the change the the the look you may have. or if you have a house that's too small, you can buy one that's bigger. It's easy to come in the mindset of of it's it's it's greener on the other side of the fence. And brother Brandham, he would ask the question, are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst? In other words, it's easy to be unsatisfied with what God has given us. And and I believe that that we're living in the time of famine. And the Bible would tell us we're living in the time of famine. And and it's incredible because the Bible tells us this ain't a normal famine. This ain't this ain't something that it's a lack of food or a lack of water. But the Bible would tell us it's the lack of hearing the word of God. And normally when you think of a famine, you think of lacking something. You think of you don't have enough food or there's not enough water. But this ain't the case in this famine. The Bible tells us in Amos 8:11, "Behold, the days come, sayaeth the Lord, that I will send a famine in the land, not a not a famine of bread, nor thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they shall run from wonder from sea to sea and from north, even to the east. They shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find him." So, in other words, it ain't missing something, but the answer is there, but they're not satisfied with it. So, it's not that they're lacking the word of the Lord. They're lacking ears to hear the word of the Lord. But, but it's incredible because the Bible says they're wandering from east and to the north looking for the word of the Lord. And you would think if they had a desire for the true word of the Lord, they could see it's in their midst. But they're looking for something, but they don't know what's what. They don't know what can satisfy the hunger. And brother Brandham, he would preach a thinking man's filter, right? And would say that that you you smoke a cigarette, you're you're you're you're wanting a certain taste, right? He says many people say is I'm just saking on it. And he says, "Well, suck on your finger." And he says, "That ain't going to satisfy it." He says, "Suck on a stick." He says, "That ain't going to satisfy because he's looking for a certain taste. And that taste can only be satisfied by the nicotine that's in that cigarette. So in other words, not anything not not anything can satisfy the taste that he's looking for. So here the world is going from church to church, denomination to denomination, from seed to sea, because they're in a famine, but they don't have a they don't have a thinking man's filter. They don't have a taste for the word of the Lord. But the Bible would tell us where the carcass is there, the eagles will be gathered together. So in other words, while one people is in a famine, the other one is eating of plenty. And the Bible would tell us in Joel 2:25, "And I will restore to you the the years that the locust has eaten, that the cankerworm, the caterpillar, and the palmer, my great army, which I sent among you, and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied. and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed. And I think it's incredible that he links being satisfied and not being ashamed together. So once you're satisfied with what God has given you, then you're not ashamed of it. So, in other words, while while the world is roaming to and fro looking for something, we are in a we're in a restoration where we're eating of plenty and we're satisfied with what is in our midst. And it would be the Apostle Paul that would say, for I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of uh uh the power of salvation to everyone that believes it. It's incredible because the reason he would not be ashamed of it is because he was persuaded of it. He would say, "I'm persuaded that nothing can separate me from the love of God." So, and so since he was persuaded of it, he was satisfied with it. Then he was not ashamed of it. And I believe we have too many Christians that is unsatisfied with what God has given us. So, they're looking for something. They're trying to satisfy their hunger with this. They're trying to satisfy this with with with this church doctrine. But little do they know that God has given us something to restore us back to original condition where it's fellowship with God and God alone. Not fellowship with a priest or a preacher or a church doctrine, but it's FELLOWSHIP WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. JOB, WHERE WAS YOU WHEN THE SONS OF God shouted for joy? In other words, you was before YOU WAS IN THIS TRIAL. YOU WAS IN MY MIND AND AFTER THE TRIAL YOU'RE going to be back in my mind. So be satisfied with what I am giving you. So I believe that the meat of the word satisfies the taste of the eagles. And brother Brandham in that message of thinking man's filter then he's tasted of heavenly things. He's got the word of God in his heart. He sees it manifested before him and his whole soul is wrapped into it. and the world and all of the things around him is dead. I think that's a powerful quote. He's tasted of heavenly things. So once he's tasted of it, he's willing to he's willing to wrap his whole soul into it. See, not partially wrap yourself into it, but once you're tasted of heavenly things, you're willing to wrap every part of yourself into it. If it's your family life, I'm going to wrap it in two. If it's my children, I'm going to wrap it in wrap them in two. If it's my church, I'm going to wrap it because I've tasted of heavenly things. Have you tasted of heavenly things this evening? That it's more than just quotes and and scriptures and doctrines, but it's heavenly things in the midst of famine that can satisfy the taste that we are looking for. So, we're not just just tasting of anything, but we're eating of the word that God has given us in this generation. And brother Brandham would say, "Have you ever thought how great that is? What could you give in exchange? In this day of confusion, this day when people don't know what to do, which way to go, the Bible said these days would come that there would be a famine in the land, not for bread or water, but for hearing the true word of God." And the people would go from east to the west, the north to the south, seeking to hear the true word of God. And here we are privileged tonight to see the message of God. So here, brother Brandham says that they're seeking to hear the true word of God because every every lie has a portion of truth in it. Brother Brandham would tell us that that the Baptist had a portion of truth, but then they denominated around it, right? And so they have a portion of it and they're looking for something, but they're stuck in the portion and the and the denominational filter that has been built around that. and they're looking for something but THEY CANNOT FIND IT. BUT the bride is privileged to see the message of God. And I like it whether Brandham puts it. We're not just looking at something but we understand it. Right? Brother Brandham tells us to see means to understand. Unless you're born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God. So we're not just looking at a message, we're seeing the message. We are privileged to understand what God has given us. And then he he would say, "We're privileged tonight to see the message of God, the angel of God." And I'm so thankful that we have seen the star that God has given us in this generation. We're a privileged people. THAT'S ENOUGH TO SATISFY every hunger. That's enough to satisfy every part of our life. And so, we're not looking for the word of the Lord, but we have found it. You remember the parable of the lost coin that she will look everywhere. She looked under the vase. She would look under the carpet. She was trying to find her lost coin. But the Bible says once she found the coin, she went from looking to rejoicing. She would say, the Bible says she got all the neighbors together and would say, "I have rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost." And I thought, "Oh my, we have a right to rejoice because the bride has found what humanity lost IN THE GARDEN. GOD HAS GIVEN us back in this generation. So it ain't a time to to look for something. It's a time to be satisfied with what God has given us. And brother Brandham would would in the message of shame would say I want to take a little text from there if to be called that called ashamed. You know I like that. Whosoever is ashamed of me and of my words I'll be ashamed of him. Now the word ashamed could also be translated embarrassed. You know, you know something, you're faced with something that you're embarrassed about. Being ashamed, that another thing being ashamed does, it shows you're not sure of what you're talking about. If you know what you're talking about and have the assurance that you know what you're talking about, you can tell anybody that cuz you're not ashamed. And so here, brother Brham is putting it that if you're ashamed, you're not sure of what you're talking about because you have no assurance. But I believe the word of the Lord has assurance behind it. I believe that we're not just the blind leading the blind and stumbling around in confusion, but there's an assurance behind it that if we can wrap our soul into it, there's promises that God has given us that we can accept and be fulfilled in our lives. And and the Bible would say in Psalms 37:18, "The Lord knoweth the days of the upright, and the inheritance shall be forever, and they shall not be ashamed in the evil time. In the days of famine, they shall be satisfied." And so, we're living in an evil time. And brother Brandon, he would tell us it's the most deceitful age. And and we're and we're living in a time where where you can't trust anybody's word. And and you have AI. You don't know if it's true or if it if it's just a robot or if it's fact or fiction. And and it's incredible that brother Brown would put it that this is the most deceitful age because if you look around, you can see it. And I believe that is by design of the devil that people is roaming to and fro looking for something and the truth is here to snatch the bride. But yet it's a deceitful time. And what the deceitfulness is trying to do is to get us unsatisfied with what God has given in our midst. And brother Brandon would say as I stood there looking at it and thinking of how deceitful it was. The question came to me and I stood back and looked at the pack again and this is in the message of thinking man's filter. It just seemed like like something said to me the slogan is all right but a thinking man a thinking man's filter a smoking man's taste. It it came to me that's that's deceitfulness also in the natural realm there in the tobacca is something on the order of the churches today. See a deceitfulness. It's come to the whole world has become a of a great deception of what really truth is and what right is. And brother Brandon would tell us in one place that that uh uh uh that there's many truths out there but there's only one truth and that is Christ. And he says that's that's heavenly born truth. And so a lie is going to have a little portion of truth in it. And and you can brother Brandon would would would see a commercial one time and and how that it was a dish soap. Y'all remember the story and how that I believe he was at an airport I think he said and he would see a commercial about some dish soap. He would order the dish soap and he would tell his wife that don't worry about the dishes. I'm going to wash them. You just go and relax. And brother Brandham says he got that dish. He he put it into that bucket, pulled it out, and it was just as dirty as it was before it went into the bucket. And then he would say this here. So I said, when I see anything highly advertised, I just bypass from it then don't bother it because I know it did not work on that. And I thought, oh my, CUZ THAT THAT THAT THAT'S HUMAN NATURE. YOU FOOL ME ONCE, YOU AIN'T going to get me again, right? And here we are in a deceitful age where there's LIE ON EVERY CORNER, LIE on every street. And it's easy to get the mentality. Oh, it's too good to be true. But this message IS THE TRUTH. NOT ONLY a truth, but it's the truth, the life, and the way. AND IT IS THE POWER TO SEE A RAPTURE. IT'S A POWER TO SEE A BODY CHANGE. IT'S THE POWER WHERE WE CAN SEE LOST LOVED ONES IF THEY WENT BY THE WAY OF THE GRAVE. It has an AUTHORITY BEHIND IT TO BACK UP THE PROMISES THAT IT HAS given because that commercial gave promises but it DIDN'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO BACK IT UP. You see, these ain't just EMPTY PROMISES THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US. BUT it there's AN AUTHORITY BEHIND IT TO BACK UP EVERY PROMISE THAT GOD has promised us. And I believe that that while we're living in this deceitful age, what the what the devil's trying to do is destroy the influence of the word. And brother Brandham, he would tell us that when Jesus was upon the earth, he says the people hated him. The the Pharisees and the Sadducees, they hated him because they were jealous of him. And he says what they done was they tried to destroy the influence of Christ before the people. And he says, "So is it today trying, the devil's trying to destroy the influence of this message before the people." And brother Brandham says, "If the devil can do that, he's got the whole thing whipped." And I think that's incredible that it that that that it's the influence of the message that is transforming lives. It's the influence of the message that that that is taking sinners and and drug addicts and alcoholics and and TRANSFORMING THEIR LIVES. THERE'S AN INFLUENCE BEHIND IT. SO if the if the devil can get it watered down to just another portion of truth like a creed or a dogma, it takes away the influence of it to change lives. It takes away the influence to keep marriages together. It takes away the influence THE THE AUTHORITY TO transform lives and individuals. But I believe that whether people are coming under ungodly influences, I believe the bride IS SATISFIED WITH THE influence of the word of the Lord and is clinging on TO IT. NOT PUSHING IT AWAY, BUT IS clinging on to the influence of the word of the Lord. And brother Brandon would say this here, the church can never progress until it knows what grounds it's progressing on. And I believe that before anybody could ever move or have real confidential faith is first have to know where they stand, how to stand after they make the stand, I believe that's essential for you cannot just head long plunge into something with faith when you don't know what you're plunging. You've got to know. And if our faith is set right in the right position, it gives constant satisfaction. So once we know where we're going because you can look at Abraham, you know, as I was thinking on these lines and the Bible says by faith Abraham when he was called out to go to a place that he would not know and and I think that that and that's an incredible thing. You know, human nature would be like, God, where am I going? God would say YOU I AIN'T TELLING YOU just leave your kindred, leave your folks behind. Leave your leave your family, leave your home, everything you know. leave it behind to a PLACE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU. And and if it would have been me, I would have said, "Well, can you show me now?" No, I need you to WALK BY FAITH. YOU SEE, SO HERE ABRAHAM WOULD WALK holy upon faith without knowing the direction HE WAS GOING. BUT THE BRIDE HAS BEEN GIVEN A DIRECTION. WE'RE NOT JUST WALKING and Lord, I'm trusting you. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. BUT WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. AND WE KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. WE KNOW GOD HAS GIVEN US A A A WORD TO give us a rapturing grace, a rapturing faith to get us CAUGHT UP INTO THE HEAVENLIES THAT ONE DAY we're going to STEP INTO OUR BODY CHANGE SO WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. AND THAT GIVES A CONSTANT SATISFACTION. ON THE BAD DAYS, I'M SATISFIED ON THE MOUNTAINTOP. I'M SATISFIED IN THE VALLEYS. I'M SATISFIED WHEN IT FEELS LIKE MY WORLD IS FALLING APART. I AM STILL IN A CONSTANT SATISFACTION BECAUSE I KNOW the direction that I am going. And that's an incredible thing that WE CAN BE SATISFIED WITH THE WORD OF the Lord and and know that God has given us an assurance. The Bible would say in 1 Thessalonians 1 and5, for a gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in the in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance. In other words, there's an influence behind it to assure you that this word can satisfy. That this word is not just empty promises, but you can put it upon your lips. And as you're speaking the word, YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE SATISFIED THAT GOD IS GOING TO BACK THAT WORD UP. WE'RE NOT EMBARRASSED to speak THE PROMISES OF GOD, BUT WE KNOW THAT GOD CAN BACK THEM UP. AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE you can look at Noah. Brother Brandon would say that it was a scientific age and yet Noah would say it's going to rain. And here brother Brandon would say there there was instruments in the sky to prove there was no such thing as rain. It had never RAINED BEFORE. BUT WHAT WOULD NOAH DO? GET UP FOR 120 YEARS. IT'S GOING to rain. AND COULD YOU IMAGINE the the scoffing and the RIDICULE THAT NOAH WOULD GET FOR ONLY CONFESSING THE WORD? HE WASN'T CONFESSING HIS OWN IDEA, HIS OWN THOUGHTS. IT WAS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD THAT HE WAS CONFESSING. AND I COULD JUST IMAGINE him getting up on A SUNDAY MORNING, PUTTING HIS clothes on, going to church, and they said, "No, you're not welcome here. We don't believe it's going to rain. There's no such thing as rain." AND HERE, NOAH MAY HAVE BEEN CAST OUT OF THE CHURCH, BUT YET THE GRACE OF GOD WOULD EMBRACE HIM. HE WAS CAST OUT OF ONE PLACE, BUT ACCEPTED INTO ANOTHER. AND WE MIGHT BE RIDICULED FOR FOR BELIEVING THE PROMISES OF GOD. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BL MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BLEND IN WITH SOCIETY. BUT YET THERE'S A PLACE THERE'S A SAFE HAVEN THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US THAT HE'S WRAPPED THIS WARMING BRACE AROUND US THAT WE CAN BE SATISFIED. HALLELUJAH. WHILE THE WORLD IS GOING TO AND FRO, I AM IN A CONSTANT SATISFACTION BEHIND THE VEIL, FEASTING ON HEAVENLY THINGS, FEASTING ON THE ORIGINAL MAN. THAT IS WHAT I AM FEASTING UPON. HALLELUJAH. So you might NOT FIT IN ONE PLACE, BUT GOD HAS accepted us in another. You remember that the Bible would talk about how there was a man that was born blind and how that Jesus would open up his eyes. Y'all remember the story? And the Bible would say that that the parents would go that the that the Jews would go to the parents, right? And would say, "Is this your son that was blind?" And what would they say? They would say, "Yep, that is our son." And they would ask them, "How did he get HIS SIGHT?" AND WHAT WOULD THEY SAY? ASK HIM, HE'S OF AGE. ASK HIM, HE'S of age. He can speak FOR HIMSELF. IN OTHER WORDS, I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS JUST OF a certain NUMBER, BUT HE WAS OF MATURITY WHERE HE WAS NOT ASHAMED TO SPEAK WHAT GOD HAD DONE FOR HIM. ASK HIM. HE'S OF AGE. They were ASHAMED TO TESTIFY OF WHAT GOD WAS DOING. BUT THIS ONE WAS OF MATURITY. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY IN one place THAT THE PENTECOSTAL SHOULD BE of age but they're not. BUT HE SAYS THE BRIDE, HE'S CALLED THE BRIDE OUT OF THE PENTECOSTAL AGE. SO IN OTHER WORDS, WHILE THE PENTECOSTAL SHOULD BE OF AGE, OF MATURITY, THEY ARE NOT. BUT THERE'S A BRIDE THAT HE'S CAUGHT OUT OF THEM AND IS PLACING THEM IN AN AGE OF MATURITY WHERE THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED TO SPEAK THE PROMISES OF GOD. OH, THIS MAN WOULD THEY WOULD COME UP TO THIS man and he would say, "I don't I don't know IF HE'S A SINNER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ALL I KNOW IS WHAT THE INFLUENCE OF HIS WHAT HE DONE FOR ME. IT CHANGED MY LIFE. I ONCE WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE. LET ME TESTIFY OF THE GOODNESS OF GOD. LET ME TESTIFY OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE WORD MADE FLESH IN MY PRESENT DAY. In this evil, DECEITFUL AGE, THE WORD STILL HAS AN INFLUENCE. WHILE THE THE LEOIAN SPIRITS IS TAKING OVER CHURCHES, YET IT IS NOT TAKING AWAY THE AUTHORITY OF THIS WORD. THIS WORD IS STILL CHANGING LIVES. IT IS STILL HEALING THE SICK. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE HE CAN STILL FIL WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. THIS WORD HAS NOT LOST ITS POWER. IT HAS NOT LOST HIS AUTHORITY, BUT IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. HALLELUJAH. IT HAS NOT LOST HIS ABILITY TO SAVE, but it can still do it. AND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT THAT HE WOULD HE would say, "I was blind, but now I see." And and so they would go to the parents would come back to the man and would say, "We're going to ask you again. How did you GET YOUR SIGHT?" AND THE MAN WOULD SAY, "IF I TELL YOU, will you believe me? I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU." AND THE BIBLE SAYS HE BE TO PREACH to the Pharisees. You can look at uh John 9 and 30. The man answered and said unto them, WHY HEREIN IS A MARVELOUS THING THAT YE KNOW NOT from whence he is and yet he hath opened my eyes? NOW WE KNOW THAT GOD HEARETH NOT SINNERS. BUT IF ANY man be a worshshiper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the world began, WAS IT NOT HEARD that any man open the eyes of the one that was born blind? IF THIS MAN WERE NOT OF GOD, HE COULD DO NOTHING. AND THEY ANSWERED HIM, answered and said unto him, THOU WAS ALLTOGETHER BORN IN SIN, AND THUS THOU TEACH US. And they cast him out. AND I THOUGHT THAT WHAT'S SO POWERFUL ABOUT THIS STORY IS THE next verse. The Bible says Jesus heard that they cast HIM OUT AND HE WENT AND FOUND HIM. SO WHILE HE WAS CAST OUT OF THE CHURCHES FOR NOT BEING ASHAMED OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE WORD, THAT WORD WOULD CLAIM HIS LIFE. HALLELUJAH. IT WOULD BE JESUS COMING AND SEEKING HIM OUT AND WOULD SAY, "YOU STOOD FOR ME. YOU WASN'T ASHAMED OF ME. I'M NOT GOING TO BE ASHAMED OF YOU." AND I BELIEVE THAT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY STANDS UPON THE WORD OF THE LORD, GOD GETS A LITTLE BIT PROUD AND WOULD SAY, "YOU'RE STANDING FOR ME. I'M GOING TO STAND FOR YOU. YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED OF MY WORD. I'M GOING TO ANSWER YOUR PRAYER. YOU'RE SPEAKING FOR YOUR CHILDREN. I'M NOT GOING TO BE ASHAMED OF YOU. I'M GOING TO ANSWER THAT PRAYER. WHILE YOU'RE BEING REJECTED BY ONE, I'M GOING TO ACCEPT YOU." HALLELUJAH. THAT YOU CAN BE SATISFIED WITH THE WORD OF THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. AND SO WHILE HE WAS CAST OUT OF ONE PLACE, he was being embraced in another. And it's incredible because Jesus wouldn't even tell him his name, you know, cuz he he didn't even know what what Jesus' name was. He would have say, "I was blind. Now I see. I don't even know his name." And here Jesus would come up to him and would say, "Do you can can you confess that THAT THAT THAT CHRIST IS THE LORD?" HE WOULD SAY, "WHO IS IT?" And he would say, "I am he." AND THEN HE WOULD FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP HIM. I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLE THAT HERE HE WAS ATTRACTED to that influence before he ever knew WHO HE REALLY WAS. WHAT IS IT? PREDESTINATION. YOU WAS ATTRACTED TO THIS WORD BEFORE YOU EVER REALIZED WHAT IT WAS. AND ONCE YOU STARTED TO EMBRACE IT, THEN GOD WOULD COME AND SAY, "HEY, I'M GOING TO CALL YOU INTO MY FOLD." HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EMBRACE THAT YOU CAN FILL ME IN EVERY SITUATION. AND IT'S incredible because brother Brandham would tell us that. But if you just rely on hope, you hinder faith. He says, "Now hope looks for something way off, but faith claims it right now." See, faith says GOD SAID SO AND IT'S MINE. That settles it. See, I don't care if I'm still crippled, if I'm still blind, if I'm still sick. That has nothing to do with it. I believe it anyhow. It's mine right now. God said so. That settles it. See, that is faith. He continues on and says, "BUT HOPE SAYS GOD SAID SO. I'm expecting to get it someday. You see, I'm expecting someday. As long as Satan can put you off another day, that's as good as he wants." He says, "That's right. You'll never get it." AND THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THE JEWS WERE DOING. the the the the Pharisees were doing. THE MESSIAH IS COMING, BUT THIS AIN'T HE. And here, this blind man saying he's doing WHAT THE WORD SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO. SO, HE WASN'T pushing it off in the future, BUT HIS FAITH WAS CLAIMING IT RIGHT THEN. SO, Brother Brandham continues on in that quote. He says, "You'll never get it. JUST BELIEVE THAT YOU GOT IT RIGHT NOW." HE SAYS, "It's your personal property. Faith is the substance of things hoped for. The evidence of things not seen is that right faith ACTS NOW IT'S POSITIVE. HE SAYS OH MY I TELL YOU SICKNESS and everything ELSE WHEN FAITH STEPS IN IT'S LIKE A SNOWBALL on a hot stove. It just melts away. Everything goes away from faith because faith stands up and takes over. When faith speaks, EVERYBODY ELSE KEEPS STILL. And I thought that's a powerful thing THAT HE SAYS FAITH has a VOICE AND IT'S A POSITIVE VOICE. When faith speaks, EVERYTHING ELSE SHUTS UP. SO IN OTHER WORDS, hope is pushing it off. GOD CAN DO IT. GOD can do it. God can do it. AND THAT VOICE IS SPEAKING SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE AND IT HAS NO ASSURANCE OF TODAY. But when faith speaks, IT AIN'T PUSHING THE PROMISES OFF TILL TOMORROW, BUT IT'S CLAIMING THEM RIGHT NOW WITH AN ASSURANCE. HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN THE VOICE OF FAITH SPEAKS, EVERY DOUBT SHUTS UP. EVERY OTHER INFLUENCE, IT HAS TO BE QUIET BECAUSE FAITH HAS SPOKEN A POSITIVE VOICE. HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE. I WANT MY LIFE TO SPEAK FAITH. I DON'T WANT IT TO SPEAK DOUBT OR NEGATIVITY, BUT I WANT MY TESTIMONY TO BE LIKE ENOCH'S TESTIMONY. You can LOOK AT HEBREWS 11:5. BY FAITH, ENOCH WAS TRANSLATED THAT HE SHOULD not see death and WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD HAD TRANSLATED HIM. FOR BEFORE HIS TRANSLATION, HE HAD THIS TESTIMONY THAT HE PLEASED GOD. BUT WITHOUT FAITH, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE HIM. IN OTHER WORDS, HIS LIFE WAS SPEAKING A VOICE OF FAITH. HALLELUJAH. YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO SPEAK A SERMON LOUDER THAN YOUR VOICE. RIGHT? SO IN OTHER WORDS, ONCE HE WAS OFF OF A SCENE, HE HAD A VOICE OF FAITH THAT WAS TESTIFYING THAT I AM NOT SPEAKING NEGATIVE THINGS, BUT MY LIFE IS A POSITIVE REFLECTION OF THE WORD OF THE LORD. AND YOU KNOW, ENOCH IS YOUR TYPE. COME ON NOW. SO IF HIS LIFE WAS A REFLECTION OF POSITIVE FAITH, WHAT ABOUT US? I BELIEVE AS WE'RE WALKING IN THE IN THE WORKPLACES OR AT SCHOOL OR AT THE GROCERY STORE, I BELIEVE OUR LIFE CAN TESTIFY OF POSITIVE THINGS. HEY, IT'S EASY TO COME UNDER THE GLOOM. IT'S EASY TO COME UNDER THE CLOUDS OF HEAVINESS. BUT GOD HAS NOT GIVEN US A SPIRIT OF FEAR, BUT OF POWER AND OF A SOUND MIND. HE HAS NOT CALLED US TO BE UNDER THE CLOUDS of gloom. Come on NOW. HE HAS NOT CALLED US TO BE UNDER THE CLOUDS OF DISCOURAGEMENT WHERE OUR LIFE IS SPEAKING NEGATIVE VOICES BUT ARE WE ARE CALLED TO SPEAK A POSITIVE VOICE IN THIS GENERATION. WHAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY WHAT WE NEED IS THOUSANDS OF LIVING VOICES. WHAT IS IT? IT'S PEOPLE THAT HAS COME IN CONTACT WITH THEIR GOD AND THEY'VE GOT AN ASSURANCE AND IT'S SOMETHING POSITIVE THAT IS TESTIFYING THROUGH THEIR LIVES. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S THOUSANDS OF LIVE VOICES THAT is declaring the word of the Lord. And I want that to be my testimony that my life is pleasing unto God. And it's impossible to PLEASE HIM BUT WITHOUT FAITH. I WANT MY LIFE to be pleasing to God. And the Bible would tell us in Romans 10:8. But what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart. The word and that is the word of faith which we preach. And if you look up that word nigh, it means at hand. So the word is at hand even in thy mouth and in THY HEART. AND THIS is the word of faith which we preach. And and I like how the apostle Paul he's putting him. The word of faith ain't something to come, but it's what I'm preaching to you now. And I believe that brother BRANDON PREACHED WHAT PAUL PREACHED. AND SO THE WORD IS AT HAND. THE WORD IS NIGH THEE AT HAND. BELIEVE IT IN THY HEART AND IN THY MOUTH WHICH THIS IS THE WORD which we are preaching. And the Bible said the next verse Romans 10:9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shall believe in THINE HEART THAT GODATH RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD THOU shalt be saved. For with this heart the man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made under salvation. For the scripture saith, whosoever believeth ON HIM SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED. SO ONCE WE are taking the the word of faith into our hearts, NOW WE'RE NO longer ashamed to speak them. Cuz I don't believe the word is just just to be in THE HEART, BUT IT'S TO BE IN THE MOUTH AS WELL. RIGHT? BECAUSE WHAT'S IN THE HEART'S going to be in the mouth, right? You speak WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART. AND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US IN PSALMS 119 and 80, let my heart BE SOUND IN THY STATUTES that I be not ashamed. In other words, let me BE SO SO SOUND OR OR MY SOUL SO WRAPPED IN YOUR STATUTES THAT I AM NOT ashamed of a positive faith. And I believe that that this word is our identity. THE APOSTLE PAUL WOULD say in Colossians 2 and 10, you are complete in him. Colossians 3 and4 WHEN CHRIST WHO IS OUR LIFE IN OTHER WORDS this message is our completion THIS MESSAGE IS OUR LIFE THIS MESSAGE IS OUR ALL and all and what it is is it's not just IN OUR HEART BUT IT'S IN OUR MOUTH AND IT'S A TESTIMONY OF A POSITIVE FAITH BRANDON WOULD SAY LIKE ABRAHAM WHO CALLED those things which were not as though they WERE HE TOOK GOD AT HIS WORD BELIEVING THAT HE was able to perform perform what he had promised. He says the trouble of it is with the church today we come with hope instead of faith. He says FAITH IS POSITIVE. FAITH HAS NO booster or faith needs no booster. FAITH KNOWS WHAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT. Faith is strong. Faith has hairs on its chest. It speaks and the rest of them shuts up. He says symptoms can't not can't even speak when real godly faith speaks. And and I like how brother Brandon, he would put that he don't he didn't say that the that faith takes away the voice of the symptoms, but they have no right to speak. In other words, they still have a voice to speak, BUT WHEN FAITH is speaking, their voice can't even be heard. You see, because this message ain't going to take away your symptoms. &gt;&gt; Come on now. This message ain't going to take away your heartaches. It's not GOING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR TROUBLES. IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR STRUGGLES. BUT WHAT IT DOES, IT gives you a faith THAT SPEAKS LOUDER THAN THOSE TROUBLES. It gives you a faith THAT SPEAKS LOUDER THAN THE HARD TIMES. IT SPEAKS LOUDER THAN THE THAN THE BACKSLIDEN CHILD OR OR THE THE THE MARITAL PROBLEM THAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE. THAT FAITH IS SPEAKING LOUDER THINGS INSTEAD OF GETTING BOGGED DOWN ON THE NEGATIVE. THE POSITIVE IS CONSTANTLY LIFTING YOU up and saying, "Hey, there's a promise for you." YOU TURN ON A MESSAGE AND THAT ENCOURAGES YOUR HEART WHENEVER YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY. WHAT IS IT? IT'S FAITH SPEAKING POSITIVE THINGS THAT IS DROWNING OUT THE NEGATIVE that you are WALKING THROUGH. OH, HALLELUJAH. REMEMBER JONAH, THE BIBLE WOULD SAY THAT THAT he was in the belly of a well. You remember that story? As a child, brother Brandon would say he looked over here, wells belly. He looked over there, wells belly. HE SAYS SEAWEED WAS WRAPPED AROUND HIS NECK. HE SAYS, "WELL, WHAT WHAT AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS THE BIBLE WOULD SAY THAT HE WOULD COUNT ALL OF THOSE THINGS AS LYING VANITIES." In other words, he wasn't saying that the voices of those vanities WERE GONE, BUT WHAT they were speaking were lies compared TO THE TRUTH. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS SPEAKING AGAINST YOU. BUT WHEN it comes to THE TRUTH, THEY ARE BLINDED. THEY'RE DUMBED OUT BY THE VOICE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS JONAH 2:9, "But I was sacrificed unto thee WITH THE VOICE OF THANKSGIVING." SO WHILE THE LYING vanities were speaking, instead of speaking those same lies, he would BEGIN TO SING PRAISES UNTO GOD. YOU SEE, THE DEVIL'S GOING to speak negative things. WHY DO YOU SPEAK THEM, TOO? INSTEAD of getting down there with him and speaking the negative things, START TO PRAISE GOD WITH A POSITIVE WORD, WITH A POSITIVE FAITH. DID YOU SEE THOSE LYING VANITIES WASN'T GOING TO GET JONAH OUT OF THAT OUT OF THAT THE WELL'S BELLY? I ALWAYS GET THAT BACKWARDS. THE LYING VANITIES WASN'T GOING TO GET HIM OUT OF IT. BUT ONCE HE STARTED TO SING POSITIVE THINGS, brother Brandon WOULD SAY, "HOW DID HE KNOW which direction the temple was?" HE SAYS HE DIDN'T. IT WAS INSPIRATION. SO ONCE HE STOPPED LISTENING, COME ON NOW, TO LYING VANITIES AND BEGIN TO SPEAK POSITIVE THINGS, INSPIRATION WOULD STRIKE THAT HEART AND WOULD POINT HIM TO THE PROMISE THAT SOLOMON WOULD SPEAK MANY YEARS BEFORE THAT TIME. AND I SAY IT'S TIME TO STOP DWELLING ON THE NEGATIVE AND START SPEAKING POSITIVE THINGS. THAT INSPIRATION CAN STRIKE THAT HEART AND CAN CHANGE SITUATIONS, CAN CHANGE THE SIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH. You see, because a negative word will never go, it's not going to bring you out of depression, RIGHT? A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE IS NOT GOING TO BRING YOU OUT OF OUT OF DISCOURAGEMENT, BUT THE WORD of the Lord will, right? You see, brother Brown, he would say this here. I want to ask you a question. WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO us to come to church and sit in a meeting and ponder and maybe be discouraged because we didn't get a prayer card or maybe be discouraged because of some ill thing a neighbor did or or discouraged about one little matter or the other that keeps Christ away from you. IT'S WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ON HIM. AND AS I CAME ACROSS THAT QUOTE, I thought that's a powerful thing. WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO BE SITTING IN the present? You remember when it was Martha THAT HERE JESUS WAS AT WAS AT HER HOUSE, RIGHT? AND HERE MARTHA WAS WAS TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS. And what WOULD JESUS SAY? MARTHA, MARTHA, YOU'RE TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS, BUT MARY HAS CHOSEN THE GOOD THING. SO HERE HERE MARTHA was troubled. SHE HAD TROUBLES IN HER LIFE. BUT LITTLE DID SHE KNOW that the answer to her troubles was in the building. So instead of thinking and GETTING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ANSWER, SHE GOT WRAPPED UP IN HER TROUBLES. COME ON NOW. WE CAN DO THE SAME THING. COME IN THE PRESENCE OF CHRIST. AND GOD'S MOVING AND THE WORD IS COMING FORTH TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, BUT WE'RE THINKING ON THE TROUBLES. WE'RE WRAPPED UP IN THE HARD TIMES. WE'RE WRAPPED UP IN BITTERNESS. WE'RE WRAPPED IN WHAT THIS ONE SAID, WHAT THAT ONE DID. AND HERE CHRIST IS SAYING THINK I'VE GOT THE ANSWER IF YOU CAN GET AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THINK ON THE POSITIVE. HALLELUJAH. MY HE says brother Brown in that QUOTE HE SAYS THAT KEEPS CHRIST away from you. And I thought I don't want my my negative thinking to keep Christ from me. I'm sure that's your attitude as well. I don't want my negative confessions to keep the word keep Christ away from me. BROTHER BROWN WAS SAY SO WE WANT TO change from hope today to a positive faith. He says there's only one way we CAN GET POSITIVE FAITH. THAT'S BY POSITIVE THINKING OF POSITIVE THINGS. THERE WE GO. THERE'S OUR ANSWER. HOW DO I GET THIS POSITIVE FAITH, BROTHER JOSH? BY THINKING ON POSITIVE THINGS. AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD DEAL with with positive thinking. He would say, you hear so much of it today, positive thinking. Think on positive things. Brother Brandham would say this here. You just put your mind on anything and think and THINK POSITIVE ON IT. HE SAYS THE DEVIL can do that. He says there's only one thing that rules over ALL AND THAT'S GOD'S WORD. If you are thinking contrary to the word, forget your thinking. Think on the word. So we're not JUST THINKING POSITIVE THINGS. WE'RE THINKING THE POSITIVE things that THE WORD HAS PROMISED US. THIS AIN'T PSYCHOLOGY LIKE YOU KNOW THOUGHT OVER MATTER. YOU'RE TRYING TO THINK YOUR WAY into it. You're trying to think YOUR WAY OR OR PROMISE TO DO BETTER. BUT WE'RE THINKING ON THE POSITIVE WORD AND THAT WORD HAS AN INFLUENCE. AND AS WE'RE THINKING ON THAT WORD, INSPIRATION CAN STRIKE. THAT WHEN THE WORD'S COMING ACROSS, THAT WORD IS FOR ME. THE WORD IS FROM MY FAMILY. THE WORD IS FROM MY SITUATION. THE WORD IS FROM MY CHILDREN. THE WORD IS FROM MY MARRIAGE. THE WORD IS WHAT I HAVE. THAT'S THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION. WHAT IS IT? WHILE YOU'RE THINKING ON THE POSITIVE THINGS OF THE WORD OF GOD, THEN INSPIRATION CAN STRIKE IT. HALLELUJAH. And I CAN TESTIFY THAT THAT THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES, you know, where you be on the work the on the on the job site or driving down the road and and you're listening to a tape and and you're thinking of what's on the tape, right? IT AIN'T JUST BACK BACKGROUND NOISE, BUT YOU'RE THINKING ON THE WORD OF THE LORD AND INSPIRATION STRIKES THE HEART AND YOU THINK, "OH MY, THAT'S WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT." YOU KNOW, OH THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT. WHAT WAS IT? WHILE I WAS THINKING ON THE POSITIVE THINGS OF THE WORD, INSPIRATION WOULD STRIKE THE HEART. AND I BELIEVE THAT DON'T JUST HAPPEN TO PREACHERS. COME ON. NOW, I BELIEVE THAT CAN HAPPEN TO LEOTY. BUT THE PROBLEM OF IT IS WE'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH IT. RIGHT? IF YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH IT, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TURN ON THE TAPES, RIGHT? WHENEVER YOU'RE WASHING THE DISHES, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TURN ON THE TAPES WHENEVER YOU'RE WHENEVER YOU'RE AT THE JOB SITE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TURN ON THE TAPES. BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY SATISFIED WITH IT, HALLELUJAH, THAT'S YOUR ENTERTAINMENT. IF YOU'RE REALLY SATISFIED WITH IT, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FEAST UPON. NOT ON WHAT THIS ONE SAID OR WHAT THAT PREACHER SAID, BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT DID THE VOICE OF ALMIGHTY GOD SAY IN THIS GENERATION? Brother Brand, I'm going to say this here. We got our mind on too many things of the world. If we could throw those things off of our mind and think about him and his soon coming, there be more revelations and power in the church. Ain't that powerful that our thinking can keep revelations from striking our heart? Not don't keep revelations from coming, BUT IT KEEPS REVELATIONS FROM STRIKING THE HEART. AND HE SAYS, BUT WE KEEP thinking about things. What am I going TO DO TOMORROW? WHAT WILL I DO NEXT WEEK? WHILE WILL I HAVE MY JOB? WILL THIS BE? And this really spoke to my heart. Brother Brandham says this here. All those things are in THE HANDS OF GOD. THINK ON CHRIST. AIN'T THAT POWERFUL? WHY WORRY ABOUT IT WHEN GOD'S ALREADY GOT IT? JUST THINK ON HIM. SOMETIMES WE CROSS THE BRIDGE BEFORE WE EVER GET THERE. AND HERE CHRIST IS SAYING, "I'VE ALREADY GOT THE SOLUTION. I'VE ALREADY GOT THE ANSWER. QUIT THINKING ABOUT THAT." AND A HEAVINESS COMING OVER YOUR HEART AND THINK UPON MY WORD AND THAT WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH EVERY SITUATION. LET INSPIRATION STRIKE THAT HEART. HALLELUJAH. ALL THOSE THINGS ARE IN THE HANDS OF GOD. THANK CHRIST. RIGHT. Seek ye first the kingdom of God AND ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL BE ADDED UNTO YOU. You know, I heard I was at a youth camp one time and that brother was preaching on on on couples and he was like, you know, many people, young people are trying to find their spouse. They're trying to find their husband and their wife. He says, the Bible would say, "Seek you first the husband and all these things will be added unto you." He says, "No, seek ye first Christ, THEN ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL BE ADDED UNTO YOU." YOU SEE? SO, WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GETTING SO FAR AHEAD THAT, OH, I WONDER IF I'M GOING TO PAY THE LIGHT BILL. I WONDER IF THIS IS going to work out. I WONDER IF THAT'S GOING TO WORK OUT, BUT I'M THINKING UPON CHRIST, AND IF I'M DOING MY BEST, GOD HAS GOT EVERYTHING ELSE UNDER CONTROL. THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT. HALLELUJAH. YOU REMEMBER WHENEVER THE TORNADO IT WAS THE BOMB THE bombs were coming down I believe in World War II I believe and here uh and hear that there was a grandmother and her grandchildren were in the house and THE THE SIRENS WERE GOING OFF SAYING YOU NEED TO GO GET TO THE BUNKERS AND GRANDMA WOULD GO AND GET INTO bed and and SHE WOULD LAY DOWN AND WOULD go to sleep and one OF THE CHILDREN WOULD SAY GRANDMA WHAT ARE YOU DOING WE NEED TO GET TO THE SHELTER SHE SAYS YOU KNOW MY BIBLE SAYS THAT MY GOD NEVER SLEEPS or slumbers so there's no need for both of us BEING AWAKE SO I'M GOING TO GO TO SLEEP. YOU KNOW, THERE IS A TRUTH BEHIND THAT STORY. THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS. THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM IF GOD ALREADY HAS THE SOLUTION AND THE AND THE ANSWER TO EVERY SITUATION. JUST THINK ON THESE THINGS. THINK ON THE WORD OF GOD. TURN ON A MESSAGE. TURN READ QUOTES AND AND YOUR BIBLE AND LET THAT MEDITATION BRING YOU INTO THE presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brown, I must say also that you might tell the people, be instructed on how to how to tell them to receive their healing and how to wait and to watch for the Lord. The Lord as you meditate upon him. He says that it takes meditation on the Lord to bring him into your presence. He says THAT'S RIGHT. ALWAYS IT'S WHILE WE'RE thinking on these things that Christ appears. And so while we're meditating on the things of God, it ushers us into his presence. Hallelujah. And I know you you can testify of it when you're in and and in your prayer closet or driving down the road or even even you know doing stuff around the house and as you're thinking upon the Lord all of a sudden you come into an atmosphere of prayer you know or you come into an atmosphere of believing or or an atmosphere of worship or whether you're meditating on the right things and that would usher you into the presence of God. And and so I believe that our words are going to portray what we're fellowshipping with. And you can look at Peter Matthew 26 and 73. After a while unto After a while came unto him, they that stood by and said to Peter, "Surely thou art one of them, for thy speech betrayeth thee." Then he then began heed to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the crew A AND I THOUGHT it's it's it's incredible that here Peter could blend in. He could look like every all the other people until they started to speak and then his speech would betray who he was fellowshipping with. And it's incredible because his speech was declaring who he was with and then he would become ashamed of it. And I thought oh my then once he became ashamed he be to speak the devil's language. HOW COULD HE GO FROM ONE time speaking and them recognizing HE'S A DISCIPLE BECAUSE HE'S SPEAKING LIKE HIM to now he's cussing? What was it? He became ashamed of his positive words that he began to speak the devil's language. And you know what brother Brandon would say? He would say this here. Now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people. They say, "Well, I'm weak. My faith is not very much. I'm not a very good Christian." That's just what the devil wants you to say. You're just TALKING HIS LANGUAGE RIGHT THEN. MY SO YOU MAY NEVER CUSS A DAY IN YOUR LIFE. YOU MAY NEVER SAY A BAD WORD A DAY IN YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU can still speak the devil's language. Oh, I'm preaching NOW. JUST LIKE PETER, HE WAS SPEAKING GOD'S LANGUAGE until he became ashamed. Then his LANGUAGE WOULD CHANGE. I DON'T WANT TO BE ASHAMED of his WORDS OR BE ASHAMED of this message that I start to speak the devil's language, which is negative things, you see. But I believe that we can speak positive things. Brother Brandham would say, "Don't never let your testimony be negative. Let it be positive all the time." He would say in one place, "Let your testimony always, your thoughts, everything. Never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it." When it starts, don't entertain it. Well, you say, "I can't help the thoughts from coming." Well, that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place, but he could sure stop them from roosting. Brother Brown, he was say, "DON'T ENTERTAIN IT." WHAT WHAT WHAT'S IT mean to entertain something? To make you feel welcome, right? Whenever you ask somebody to come over your house to eat, you It's called entertaining them. Why? You don't want to just invite them, but you want them to feel welcome, right? And so, Brother Brandham says, "Don't entertain the negative thoughts. You can't keep him from coming in or coming over, but don't make him feel welcome. Oh, hallelujah. Don't make him feel welcome. YOU SEE, MY HOUSE DOES NOT HAVE to be under a negative confession. It may come against it, but I don't got to entertain it, right? You brother would say that that that if you don't got confidence in your doctor, you better get a different doctor, right? Because you're not going to take his prescription because you got no confidence in him, right? So if if somebody's constantly tearing down the doctor, you're really NOT GOING TO HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN HIM. SO NEGATIVE THOUGHTS ARE TRYING to destroy the influence of the word. And when you're entertaining them, what it's doing, it's taking away THE ASSURANCE TO FIX PROBLEMS. IT'S TAKING AWAY THE assurance to fix things in OUR LIFE. SO INSTEAD OF ENTERTAINING THEM, I say let them keep on going by, right? THEY THE CAT CAN SCRATCH OUT THE DOOR, BUT we're not going to open the door. Right. I heard I heard a story one time and I know the pullpit ain't meant for joking, but I heard a story one time that some Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on the door, right? And a man opened the door and says, "Come on in." And he says, "WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?" AND THEY SAYS, "I DON'T KNOW. WE NEVER MADE IT THIS FAR BEFORE." THAT NOBODY'S EVER OPENED THE DOOR. SO, they never had anything TO SAY. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NEGATIVE THOUGHTS COME. THEY'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY WHEN YOU DON'T ENTERTAIN THEM. COME ON NOW. THEY CAN KNOCK ON THE DOOR, BUT DON'T OPEN THE DOOR. I'M HAVING A BAD DAY. YEAH, EVERYBODY ELSE IS, TOO. DON'T SPEAK THE DEVIL'S LANGUAGE. WELL, THIS IS GOING ON. YEAH, HAVE YOU SEEN THE WORLD? DON'T SPEAK THE DEVIL'S LANGUAGE, BUT SPEAK THE PROMISES OF GOD. I HAD A BAD DAY, BUT HIS GRACE IS SUFFICIENT. I WENT THROUGH SOME HARD TIMES, BUT HE'S NEVER GOING TO LEAVE ME. He's never going TO FORSAKE ME. MY BODY MIGHT BE ACHING, BUT GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME IN THE MIDST of a deceitful AGE. I'M GOING TO SPEAK A POSITIVE CONFESSION. AND I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT. I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT BECAUSE IT'S EASY AND I'VE been there before. It's easy to get dragged into something, RIGHT? WHENEVER SOMEBODY'S talking about something, it's sometimes it's embarrassing to say the contrary, right? How many's ever been there when somebody's speaking about somebody AND AND YOU KNOW IT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE, IT MIGHT NOT BE IT MIGHT BE A LIE, BUT YOU'RE EMBARRASSED TO SAY, "HEY, that ain't true." SO SOMETIMES YOU JUST FALL INTO THAT SAME CONVERSATION. And it's easy to do THAT MANY TIMES IN A NEGATIVE WORLD. It's easy to get into that. I had a bad day. Oh yeah, me too. This went wrong. That went wrong. Man, you're not going to believe what happened to work. And what it is, YOU'RE EMBARRASSED TO SPEAK THE PROMISES OF GOD BECAUSE YOU JUST WANT TO FIT IN WITH THAT ATMOSPHERE. OH, BUT THEY THAT ARE NOT ASHAMED OF ME, I WILL NOT BE ASHAMED OF THEM. HALLELUJAH. Brother Brand, I'm going to say this here. God let God let you think on things. Study about it. It's what you come to church for. He says, if there's if there be any praise, any virtue, think on these things. He says, "What are you thinking about tonight? Maybe I won't get healed. if I I'll go back home, you you'll get what you're thinking about. He says, HAVE DETERMINED IN YOUR HEART THAT GOD WILL DO IT and God will do it. Don't pack your sin back home. DON'T PACK YOUR UNBELIEF back home. Don't pack your disease like the man here last night in the wheelchair and the different ones. You don't have to pack it back home. God will take it out of you. Ain't that powerful? We don't got to pack our TROUBLES BACK HOME. OH, HALLELUJAH. HE GOES, "WE COME TO CHURCH. WE COME TO CHURCH to get away from our troubles." And and I'm just preaching tonight. I hope this is okay. But we don't want to pack our troubles back home. He said, "I DON'T COME I DON'T COME TO CHURCH to to get discouraged." You I don't come to church to to get to get beat down and where I don't feel like I'm a Christian. I come to church to get lifted up. HOW COME THE church where God can come and whisper and say, "I know you had a bad day, but I'm a friend that's going to stick closer than a brother." And you COME IN THE CHURCH PACKING SOMETHING, BUT when you leave, you leave that baggage there. Hallelujah. Because we're thinking on somebody. Brother Brandham would say in one in one place, don't let it anchor. And here and as I'm bringing this down to a close, brother Brandham would in questions and answers, a lady would ask brother Brandham, he would what shall we do? Something has settled. He would something settled over me. He said, she would say, "It's a heaviness that is over my heart." And I would have a dream and I'm walking on on white sands and would go through details of this dream and and would say that that that that my my uh uh my my uh son and his wife is coming under a heaviness. And brother Brown, he would read this and he would come down and would answer and say, "Lady, I feel like I feel like the problem of it here's your trouble." He says, "You let something in your past trouble you." And he would say, "Now that's made you nervous." And he would say, "Now the nervousness has went from your son. It's went from the family, this family member to that family member to this family member." And he would come down and he and he's and he's nailing this. And he stops and he would say, "I think the problem OF HE SAYS, "YOUR problem is you're thinking on the wrong things." And he would stop and was say, "Well, I don't got time to go into all of it." He says, "I can keep on going." He says, "I've got another question to answer." And I thought, "Oh my, here something in the past she kept thinking on, dwelling upon and thinking." She thought she was going crazy. Brother Brandham says, "No, nothing's wrong with you. Your trouble is you're thinking on something on the wrong things. Something that happened in the past, you keep dwelling upon." And that was bringing on a nervous spirit. And I think we got a future that is greater than our past. &gt;&gt; There's no need to keep looking back. That one done me wrong. This one done me wrong. We've all been DONE WRONG. BUT GOD MADE THE WRONGS RIGHT. GOD HAS GIVEN US A PROMISE OF A RAPTURE. GOD HAS GIVEN US A PROMISE OF A OF A THEOPHONY. AND THERE'S NO NEED TO keep on being bogged down behind us. You as brother Brandham said, don't let it anchor. You know, those thoughts come through. Don't let it anchor. What does an anchor do? It stops you. Right? Whenever you're in a boat, it can have the biggest motor on it, but what happens whenever you want to come to a stop? You set out the anchor. Too many times we set out anchors of hard feelings and and anchors of this and that and we're thinking upon it. But you know what they do when they let the anchor loose? Normally they let it go. They let that whole anchor go cuz they don't want to bring it with them. And I think that's what we need to start doing is all the troubles in the past, all the hurt feelings, all the bitterness, I'm not going to think on those things, but I'm going to let them go. Are you letting them go this evening? And say, Lord, I'm going to think on the right things because I want to be closer to God. I know that's your I know that's that's your attitude. I want to be closer to God. There's no need to be in a rut of just going in circles and circles, but but I want to speak the promises of God in my life and and watch them come into manifestation. David would say in Psalms 119 and 14, so shall I keep thy law continually forever, and I will walk at liberty, for I seek thy precepts. I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings and will not be ashamed. Let our musicians come this evening. I will speak thy testimonies before kings and will not be ashamed. You may say, "I'm never going to stand before a king. I'll never stand before a prince." But yet, there's kings that of hard feelings and kings of loneliness and negativity that we don't have to be ashamed to speak in front of and say, "Hey, no more in my life." And and what's incredible is is there was a lady of the Bible would say a certain woman in the book of Judges and I know it's been quoted a lot but the Bible says that there was a certain woman that there was a king that was invading your land and and how this king was wiping out the military. It wiped out it wiped out all of the men. And there was some people that would go into a tower. And the Bible would say that this invading army would come, the king would come to that door, knock the door down, would go into the tower and kill everybody in that tower. But there was a certain woman that would go into a strong tower. Wasn't just a tower. It was a strong tower. And the Bible says that that invading king would come and would beat on the door. beat on the door but could not get into that tower because he couldn't get through the door. And Christ would say, "I am the door." You know, and here the Bible would say that this the certain woman, a faith woman would look out of the tower and would grab a piece of a millstone. She didn't have the whole millstone. She just had a piece of it. And she would throw that millstone down and would destroy that king. Am that's the way the promises of God are. the Bible or brother Brown say what is confessions it's stones right and so you might not be able to quote the whole Bible you might not be able to quote all the message but you can take a piece of it and that confession is a stone just like David would say you come against me with sword with spear but I come in the name of the Lord he wasn't ashamed of it and he would send a stone that would bring that giant down before him and I believe our confessions are stones and we're not ashamed of them and Brother Brown would say, "What does confession mean?" He said, "What what does confess? What is really confession?" He says, "Confession means to say the same thing." Hallelujah. He would say right before that, he would say that that the prophets of old was not ashamed to speak before kings, the he says the priests, he says because they were they had directly thus saith the Lord. So that's why they're not ashamed. And if we're and if confession means to say the same thing. We're speaking thus sayaith the Lord. That's why we're not ashamed. And that's why Jesus would would be so confident that you don't have to be ashamed. If you're not ashamed of me, I'm not going to be ashamed of you because you're going to have thus sayaith the Lord. Think no thought of what I shall say. But in the time when when it needs to be said, I'll give you the words to say. What is it? And I believe God has given us the words to say. What is it, John? Take the book. Eat the book. prophesy again, right? He ate the book and what he was fellowshipping on, he began to speak and I believe which is a type of the bride. We're fellowshipping upon the positive word of the hour and we're prophesying again. We're speaking the same things and the same miracles I believe that happened when brother Brandon was upon the earth can happen now. Come on now. I believe devils are still subject. Spirits are still subject. I believe tormenting devils that try to take over minds and and bodies and emotions are still subject to the name of Jesus. But it takes somebody who's not ashamed of it. Who's not ashamed to get down and say, "Lord, I'm taking you at your word. No matter what, no matter if it's me against the world, against the against everybody, I'm going to take the word of the Lord in every situation. I'm going to take control of the atmosphere in my home, the atmosphere in my house, my family. I'm not ashamed of it. Amen. Can we bow our heads here this evening? Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we love you here tonight. Lord, as we feel your presence here among us, Lord, I know there's not many here tonight, Father, but Lord, thank you for honoring us with your presence. Lord, it's so easy to get bogged down in the negative, Lord. It's a negative world, Lord. Nobody has a good day anymore. But God, you've given us a positive word. Lord, you've given us some stones that we can speak. And Lord, you sent us a mason that can build up the stones. Show us where the stones go. Lord, we're not just babbling words, but we've come under an inspiration, and it's an inspired word. That's why we can have such an assurance. Lord, this is a living word that can inspire our hearts. And as we speak it, we know it's thus sayaith the Lord. Lord, and if there's some here tonight that might be under the clouds of heaviness, under the clouds of negativity, Lord, may they begin to think on positive things. So, so a positive voice can speak out of their life. Lord, we want a positive faith. Lord, how I hope so, but Lord, we're eagles. We believe. Lord, we love you and we ask that you'd be with us here tonight in Jesus name. Amen. Can we sing that tonight, brother Corby? If you just keep your mind. Can we stand and sing this tonight on me? Oh, keep your mind. faithfully I will give perfect peace, sweet release if you'll just keep your mind stay on. Oh yes. Keep your mind stay on me. Stay on me. Faithfully.

By the grace of God, I wear a shining crown. I'm going to keep holding on to his nail scar hands. Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I can Let me sing verse one. I've been walking through this valley, through this bell of tears, and times I've even questioned. Even if my Lord was near. And at times that old tempter says, "Why not turn around? You can't get any further. You're just losing ground." Oh, but I'm not giving up. Oh, I'm not turning round. Oh, by the grace of God, I'll wear a shining crown someday. I'm going to keep holding on to his nail scarred hands. Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep going on. Oh, would you like to tell me there's been something bothering me? Why is it that old devil? Let God's children be. You see, he has purpose and determined to get right in the way and turn us from the way of life and turn our souls astray. But I'm not giving up. Is that your confession tonight? &gt;&gt; Oh no. &gt;&gt; The grace of God will shine round someday. Holding on to his nail scarred hands. I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep going on. Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep going on. Amen. Well, God bless you this evening. I pray something was said to strengthen you in some way. It was good to good to be in the house of the Lord tonight once again. Good to see brother Joe and Sister Stephanie. So good to see y'all. And are y'all here for a couple of days? Well, I mean good to see y'all again. Hopefully we get to fellowship a little bit maybe after service or something. But it was good to see y'all. And remember to keep Sister Stacia in prayer. I hadn't heard anything as as she had the baby yet at an eighth. So, let's remember her in prayer and Patrick, of course, he has the hard job eating all the snacks and be in good company. So, I was always good at that. But anyways, let's let's keep them in prayer that the Lord will keep mama and the baby safe there. Let's bow our heads one more time. Dear heavenly father, Lord, we're thankful for this opportunity, Father, to come into your house, Lord. Thank you for your presence that we felt here tonight. Lord, as we leave this place, may we not leave your presence, Lord, but may we entertain your spirit, Father. God, may we dwell on the right things, on the right thoughts, Father. God, we ask that you would be with Sister Staca, Brother Patrick, Father, and the baby that would be born tonight. We ask that you would just strengthen Staca, Father, give be with the doctors, Lord. We ask that you'd be with everyone as we would leave this place, God. Keep us safe as we go to our respected places. We love you, Father. in Jesus name. Amen. Can we sing that again as we're being dismissed? Oh, I'm not giving up. God bless you. The word around the grace of God I'll wear a shiny crown. Someday I'll be holding on to Del Scott. Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep going on. Oh, I'm not giving up. Are you taking? Oh, I'm not turning around. Oh, by the grace of God, I'll wear a shiny crown. Someday I'll be home. to Islam. Oh, I'm not giving up.
