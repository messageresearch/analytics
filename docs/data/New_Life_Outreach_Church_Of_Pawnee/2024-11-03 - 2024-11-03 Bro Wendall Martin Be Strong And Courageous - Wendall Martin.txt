I I'm thankful to the Lord for that and um so we just uh we just greet you all in the name of the Lord here this morning and know that the Lord has uh wonderful things uh for every one of us if if we come expecting to receive I'd like to look here in the book of Galatians the 6th chapter and the um uh we we'll start there at the seventh verse we'll go 7th 8th and N9 and then we'll also be looking in Joshua the first chapter and and um uh we we are thankful we appreciate you musicians and and um amen it's it's been good to have brother Josh and sister Loretta uh with us here this this last week

to see sister April and and uh the family make it back and good to see sister Caroline God bless you and uh you know this is the weekend that we were supposed to be having our U our our fall fellowship and uh the rain sort of stopped that but uh hey we can still have a fall Fellowship inside the building here this morning fellowshipping around the word of the Lord let's look here at Galatians six and seven it says be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap I want you to say it with me for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he reap for he that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting let us not all of us read together now let us not be weary in welld doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not now let's go to the book of uh Joshua and um would like to read here and um we'll just start at the seventh verse amen only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage everybody say be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest now both of these scriptures are the same amen whatsoever you sow you're going to reap when you soow to the flesh you will automatically reap of the flesh corruption but if you soow to the spirit you shall reap unto everlasting life now Joshua is telling us don't let this law depart from from your heart and from your lips let this law meditate upon it do according that it is written for then Thou shalt be successful then Thou shalt be prosperous and then he says those great words that are still circling the earth today be of good courage or or be strong and of good courage for the Lord thy God is with thee father we want to thank you today for your love and your blessings thank you Lord that no matter what we go through Lord that you have already been through it you have already seen it you've been in our tomorrows and Lord I know it can be disheartening for uh our elders there Lord to wake up with their bed wet and clothes wet and the Lord the the the rain coming in through the house there and but God I'm asking that you would strengthen their hearts and Lord encourage them I pray Lord that you would be with every one that is here this morning as we Minister Lord along these lines of courage and I pray Lord that you will strengthen them Lord you see Lord those that that that are that are fighting that uh uh Strep throat Lord and I I pray that you would go to those homes and that you would heal them Lord and make them whole father Lord we look to you today now Lord we just ask that you would you would be with us as we as as we have opened your word as we have read it Lord now Lord we're asking that you would take it from our from our head Lord down to our soul and let it be impregnated Lord with these words be strong and of good courage and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here this morning amen want to minister along the lines of of the family and um and I I I want to uh uh just just uh be strong and of good courage you know if we if we if we've ever heard those words don't be weary and welld doing we need to hear those words today amen it it's um we we need we need to hear take Courage the Lord is with thee th those words that amen be strong and of good courage that's not just coming from a a a mortal's lips that's coming from Eternal God and the great Eternal God God is saying listen I've called you for a specific purpose amen and the purpose that I've called you for it's going to be it's going to be challenging there's going to be plenty of things there to Amen to uhh pull you one side or the other so I'm telling you right now before you go into that land be strong and of good courage amen I I now listen I'm giving you my word I've given you the law I've I've given you these promises and I want you to know they've got to be in your mind they've got to be in your heart you've got to meditate upon these you've got to and I just want you to know I've called you to possess that land only be strong and of great courage amen I I I want to say God's original plan and purpose was for courageous men and women amen God's original plan that word courageous means amen not deterred by danger or pain it means brave Fearless Valiant lionhearted amen that's the kind of men and women that God's raising today amen that's the kind of teenagers God's raising today amen courageous men that are not going to be deterred by danger not deterred by pain not deterred by these kinds of things but vant in their heart now the opposite of courageous amen is cowardly amen it it it it means fainthearted spineless timid fearful so so the opposite of courageous amen is what fainthearted spineless timid fearful hey well praise the Lord can you say Amen so I as I was thinking about the about the service today amen as we're going to have communion here tonight I I think there is a amen there there is something that is that that we should be very Vigilant against and that is the spirit of lukewarmness Amen if there is something that we need to take courage against today is that Spirit of lukewarmness Amen remember second Thessalonians reads amen because they did not receive the love of the truth amen God would send them strong delusions to believe a lie thinking that they're right now thinking they're right but they would be damned by the LIE amen that they are believing and so when you lose your love for God do you realize that love for your brother and love for God is connected together amen that's right when you lose your love for God you lose your love for your brother amen when you lose your earnestness for God you lose that sincerity Amen in your prayer for your brother and the conditions that your neighbor is in you lose that because the love of uh for fellow man can only the genuine love for for your fellow man can only come from God himself amen a this this lay out of see a love is is is me me me me lay out a seal of I'll love you until I'll love you if I'll amen but God's love I I he's just telling you here today I want you to be strong and very courageous the love that I have for you is the same love that I've always had for you amen this is God saying it now amen what I started out with on you I don't care your trials I don't care amen your failures I don't care where you are I want you to know when I start out loving somebody I'm going to keep on loving them well that should make anybody be courageous when you lose your love for your God you lose your love for others amen then you are nothing better than a beast or an animal amen because they can't love the way a a a Son of God can love they can't give the way a Son of God can give but you can because you are a son of God Amen when in a day when love has become such a foreign thing we need courageous men we need courageous teenagers we need courageous men and women can you say Amen men and women who ordained to stand amen I I I was thinking this morning amen courage courage to keep our Spirits right amen courage in a day amen where every where there are two uh hund thousand, demons that are that are that are there plaguing the mind and and your mind is overwork like never before Amen in an age where where these demons are amen they they they they they they interpret things to you and they amen they they're they're everywhere but I just want you to know amen God knew those two million demons were going to be here the prophet of God says they had to be released in this last day because they're trying to hinder the bride for the Rapture hallelujah amen sat has set up his his big old regime amen the World Council of churches and he's taken all of these denominations amen and bringing them in but he looks to the church and he says be strong and of good courage have not I called you have not I ordained you have not I put my law of faith on the inside of your heart Amen to where you can stand against the evil one I have called you be strong and of a good courage sir Hallelujah well praise the Lord Lord amen courage keeping that Spirit right when every mind is against the other and such hatred is in every World System it's in our churches it's in our politics well can I hear an amen it's in our amen it and and it's in the home lives the scripture says amen that mothers would be against daughters and amen fathers would be against Sons amen the scripture says amen that every man would be for his own but in the midst of it all I can hear the words be strong and of a good courage you stand up against that enemy that would come against you in an age where there's so much discontentment and no one is satisfied with who they are and what they have and marriages are falling at such a fast pace amen I can hear the words to the elect I want you to know you're going to possess you're going to possess a Rapture you're going to possess the High Calling of God you're going to come back to this earth and you're going to be amen You're Going To Rule and reign in this earth be strong and of good courage can you say Amen strength strength strength that only comes from that that great God Almighty who has called you to it amen hallelujah hallelujah now the scripture says because iniquity abounds in this last day that the love of many would wax cold there'd be no Zeal for righteousness there'd be no Zeal Amen to to display the heartbeat of God and the desires of God there there that there would come a point now I and I want to go back to it again Mama against uh daughters and and and and sons against fathers and a and this kind of I'm I'm here to tell you we're in a day where every man is for himself even even even with the bloodline willing to throw Mama under the bus daddy under the bus ready to throw the boy under the bus ready to willing to kill anybody Hallelujah I don't care I don't care if you are nine months amen and you're ready to be born if I decide I don't want you there's a group in the world Amen that is pushing for that kind of an abortion amen it's insane the kind of realities that are hereen This Land Is So vexed by self-indulgence judgments are not weighed according to scripture yeah you see today judgments are weighed amen by on an emotional level so decisions are based on emotion decisions are based amen what affects me in my is on an emotional level and and there's no genuine love to judge things according to scripture well praise the Lord but God's saying listen the only principle that'll ever work is my word amen keep the law of God in your mind and then you will have success and then you will be prosperous so what God is saying be strong to stand stand against anything that would come against the amen the realities of God in your soul brother Bram would put it this way he says that's the American attitude we've got television we got plenty of money we got Fine Cars we've got nice homes amen what do we need the Lord with the Lord we don't need that amen that's the attitude he goes on and says amen he says the love would be so far away in these last days that the only love there would be left would be between the elect of God's people amen now now now catch that where there's not even a love amen for in the world for anything it would be only among the elect of God Amen now he would say father would be against mother and mother against father and children against parents and different ones against each other but the only love that would be left would be just that elect someone one shout hallelujah amen he stops and he says just the elect the word elect there comes from elected God's elected people and God says I want you to be strong somebody say strong somebody say courageous amen that's not me telling you that that's God telling you that be strong be courageous that ain't your mama telling you that that ain't good way wishes it's the Eternal Word of God and is looking to his bride and he's strengthening you with those words right now be strong and of good [Music] courage Hallelujah you mean I can do it if papa says you can do it you can do it can you say Amen standing with that deep conviction and great courage amen standing there fighting to keep an undefiled spirit before God hallelujah you know what you you know what we need more than anything else is we need the Hallelujah more than we need a president more than we need Trump more than we need Camala and more than we need a republican Congress and house what we need amen is the approval of God can you say amen amen we've read this in the tharan church age book the other day amen how many's enjoyed the church age book amen amen they're in the thy Church age book he says now I want to give a warning we we read this a couple Services back I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days because of the abundance of iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the L lay out of SE or last stage selflove and love for material things will take the place place of the true love of God and we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they have not realized the effect of this last day he says it's time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of this last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us I want you to take these words I want you to meditate don't just go to church and amen don't just read it occasionally amen and say I've read it I want these words to be in your soul I want these words to be in your heart I want you to meditate only when you meditate upon these words will you be successful only then can you overcome man oh Church of the Living God Allelujah we need courage amen courage to open our hearts and to judge our motives here this morning judge our our attitudes and our objectives this morning amen a courage to open our hearts for the Holy Spirit to search amen as we as as we went through amen a couple of church age readings ago amen where they would take the candle of God Amen they would take the candle and they were required to go through their through their homes their their tents amen wherever they were at and they were to look for leaven now the scripture says they were to look in every corner crook cranny under they had to make sure amen that there was nothing there well praise the Lord now I was when I was preaching that the other day amen as as we had read that um and I'm I I feel so bad I can't remember who told me um was there anybody in here that that told me that that that you you've got some friends that that uh uh clean for Jewish people that was you amen that that that clean and they said when the Passover time has come they they they hire someone to come in and clean that house to where there is dust on nothing amen so they still keep the routine today now now the the leav was sin brother bradam said sin is unbelief so anything that would hinder you amen from selling out to God is unbelief and so the the they they were required to take the leav or the candle and de clean make sure there is nothing anywhere well Church of the Living God I said today if there's ever a time to take that great Pillar of Fire amen and put that fire shine it down in my mind shine it down in my body shine it down in my heart shine it everywhere Lord shine your light on me I want to be right I want to be saved I want to be whole I want courage uh courage to look in the mirror and say buddy you're going to line up with the word of God cry to say I need God's approval in my life amen search me because a little bit of Leaven leavens the whole bum lump well praise the Lord you boys and girls you get you get mad at just one person on the playground and before you know it amen if you keep that in your heart then you're and you don't make that right then then you're going to you're going to find that toward other people and you'll become a bully can you say amen amen that's the way it goes with any of us us mama and daddies know about that amen you let a little bit of something Fester up between you and your wife and before you know it amen you're nitpicking at everything she does come on but someone has got to stand courageous and says I am not going to allow that devil in my life and God says you're going to overcome God say says you're going to share my Throne God says and the way you're going to do it is you're going to take the law that I have given you through the open book be strong and have very good courage sir can you say amen hallelujah now amen courage to contend for the faith courage to stand for that which pleases the Lord a courage a courage to lay our lives down for ourselves or to lay ourselves and our families upon God's Altar and to cry out for God to take every Wicked thing from us if there's ever a time for us to amen tell the Lord please don't let these layot us see of devils there's two million of them 200,000 thousand that have been released amen don't let those evil spirits of Leo to see you have me Lord please take not as the psalmist wrote your spirit from me oh God take your Holy Fire and cleanse me burn up the dross and let the gold remain take the wood and the hay in the stubble you see it takes courage in this day of self-love it takes courage in this day to stand up and resist the tide that Satan is bringing against you and your family and the church and the community and everything else it takes courage now but somebody must there ain't no love out there brother that they ain't they ain't loving righteousness like the elect loves righteousness they ain't loving God's approval like the

yours be strong and possess it oh but brother Wendell it's hard it's tough the enemies against me stand strong the enemy cannot have it it's your [Applause] land and no enemy will sit there and anoint your flesh Amen brother bradam says the greatest enemy that William bram's got is William bradam well praise the Lord amen the greatest enemy amen is yourself amen but somebody's going to be courageous and haul this old body amen according to Romans the 12th chapter haul this old body to the altar of God Amen and lay it up there as a Living Sacrifice and I want to tell you if it ain't living and screaming and kicking then God don't want it amen but when your body is is a screaming and a kick it and your will amen is wanting to do something else surrender it to God and offer it to the Lord and let him use you and anoint you and bring his love and mercy to reality hallu Hallelujah courage courage to stand as psalms 27 and9 hide not thy face far from me courage courage to say put

than you might think the Bible says Proverbs 14 And1 I believe it is a w every wise woman builth her house with her hands and and and that the that the uh but a but a a Wicked Woman tears the house down with her hands yeah every every wise woman builds her house and the foolish woman plucks it down with her hands you know what I am I doing all right here this morning I think the greatest compliment that could ever be given to any man woman amen is to go unnoticed yes sir you say unnoticed that's not good brother wend no it's those unnoticed folks that cause things to run so smoothly and it looks like it goes so easily and things go well praise the Lord amen things go so smoothly that it looks easy amen those guys that the responsibilities is so cherished and so taken care of that I'm going to take care of my my my my my husband and my wife it's my job it's my call it's who I am can you say amen and you wives only want to be accounted for by God you want your families to thrive you want a happy husband you want you want children that love you that love God God Amen when you're overlooked many times it's because you're you've mastered your craft well praise the Lord and what you do seems so effortless what you do it just amen you do it so well well glory to God Amen and and and and and and few people even know all the hardships that you go through the greatest compliment amen is for a man to trust his wife trust his wife to the point sometimes that he takes her for granted okay now I'm not now I now I'm not I'm I'm not telling you Brothers you're right for taking her for granted but I'm telling you mamas that you're doing you you you must be doing a good job you know the ones that get un that really get noticed the ones that ain't doing their job well praise the Lord it's when things are broken or left undone or done poorly that it sticks out right when kids aren't fed they you know there there there ain't no woman that cares about her family and her house and praise the Lorden we have had a you know I bought my wife just two years ago bought her a washer another washer and dryer and uh so man we paid I mean you know I think I paid I don't know paid a whole year salary it seems like but I don't know I don't know what I paid for those things they man those those stupid things are expensive and they're so expensive I wasn't about to buy a warranty and I said these things surely this thing is so expensive it's going to work for a long time two years later amen the thing won't spin and it it's not not working and and U you know no one said much about that washer until it was broke come on I I I I am I I I I hope I'm talking to you men I I want you to appreciate what you got because when it's broke it's broke when it's broke nothing works when it's broke that you don't take your girl for granted so Tina she's she's that Tina's she's she's quite she she can she can do anything and uh so Tina was she took that thing apart and uh her and YouTube and and you know what was holding up the whole $1,600 washer was a little Old Spring that was that what there were four Springs and though one of those Springs were bad and it wasn't balancing the washer she put put it in there and put it all back together and it worked for a week it worked for a week huh three days so I got in there and I said well I'll fix it these girls don't know what they're doing I got in there and you know got my level out and this that okay so the washing machine is not leveled right and it's not this that and it didn't work so she goes back in there orders orders another took those sent those Springs back and put it back and it's been working ever since now I I I just want show I want to tell off on these girls these I would come in the house in the Liv in the kitchen there and and and they they would be just sitting there watching it work they they were wanting to do laundry they were sitting there just watching it work more they wanted me to come in like I said listen that's it's doing what a washing machine is supposed to do yeah but it wasn't working before but well praise the Lord so I want to say that you sisters I want you to take courage because without you the family's broke true without you the it it it don't work right can you say Amen it's like a it's like an abscessed tooth or a I don't know missing a toe or something you you you it cannot work without you stay in your position Amen to all you laborers in the vineyard I say stay in your position stay in that specified condition that God has called you what is that specified condition only the elect can love only the elect can love God's word only the elect can thrive in prayer only the elect can do this because our desire is to please him can you say amen amen so what is the as as brother Bram would say you've got to be in the right condition for the Rapture amen and I say everyone Mama stay at your uh H uh in your condition because God is calling you for a special special special purpose brother buam would say now let me tell you something sister just a minute you might be oldfashioned but you've got something these sex Queens hav't got okay you might be oldfashioned but you've got something that them sex Queens hasn't got you've got something that she can never have okay you might be old fashioned in your dressing dress up like a lady they might say look at that old Holy Roller don't you worry she's got something that that little old sex Queen that's got all that world looking at her out there she hasn't got it she can never have it she is lost eternally she is doomed see she's never you got moral you got virtue she's got nothing she's got a bait that'll trap the lost souls into hell and the blind walks into it you've got something can I hear an amen sister that's right you're tired you get weary but when God wanted to show an expression there's some things that only you sisters can do not going to hold you uh uh too much longer now but God you you you God expresses himself through men as in as a strong leader but he also expresses himself through you women and your love Jesus Jesus when he wanted to express himself to Israel as he's sitting on top of the mountain and he's looking down over Jerusalem and he's weeping and he's saying and he's crying out Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I would have gathered thee but thou wouldest not I would have taken thee as a hin mother dust her brood I would have loved you I would have sheltered you I would have done it just like a mama would do her very own children but you wouldn't do it can you say amen I think I think a woman expresses this right here Lamentations 3:22 it is the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not and they are new every morning Mama gets so tired she goes to bed she said I've had enough this is it next morning there she is right back up taking care of her family it's because there's something about you that is expressing God can I tell you something what else God you you've got the attention of God there in 1 Peter 3 and 4 he says but let it be the hidden heart of the the hidden man of the heart in which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price that's something that is given to you sisters can you say amen amen a Believer who knows who they are becomes a pillar in the house in the home in the in the church can you say amen I hope I'm encouraging you sisters here for a minute I don't go to sleep on me quite yet it's your Nazarite vow you want the anointing of God upon on you in your place you bring his anointing upon your family it's your your call it's where your anointing lies your husband feels the serenity in you your children feels the love through you amen mostly important God sees himself expressed through you can I hear an amen good thing about a metal roof you can always enjoy the rain amen amen I know this sounds crude but it's a powerful statement and I think it should be liberating for you sisters in the midst of this of this evil age where the women's lib has so pushed their agenda and it and it makes a a real woman feel feel useless unfulfilled brother brandham in knoweth it not right this is this is 8:15 1965 he says her place is a man's Queen at home outside of that she has nothing now I know that stings and and and I'm going to stop right here and I can now for you for you that are you single M and and you know you've been divorced and I can hear you say see I have nothing no no no no no no no no taking care of your children so you may be a a a a a a divorced woman in here you may have you know I and I and and and there's there's you know Satan can take can take a a good quote like this that I would read and then just make give you a bad day uh for the for the rest of your life but here brother brandom is talking about if we don't if we don't catch the real meaning of what the family truly is and he's saying you're to be a queen you're to take care of that home in other words you don't belong out there fighting with the men and and and and doing that with your spirit all hardened now brother Brandon would say we know that to be the truth you'll find I know that sounds oldfashioned but I'm responsible I know that after my going away from this Earth uh uh uh going them tapes and them books will be living on and many of you young children will find in the days to come that this is exactly the truth because I speak it in the name of the Lord now in the midst of perversion God is calling for you sisters to stand strong and courageous against those Spirits that'll take you out of your position yes he he he stands strong strong those devils are out there trying to pull you this way and pull you that way and those Spirits are try to those feminine Spirits out there that try amen TR try to come and grab you grab a hold of your your heart grab a hold of your mind get your spirit all in an uproar you just remember God has not called a woman to be up in an uproar amen you have a way of being able to calm your children calm your husband you have a way of being able to bring on the scene can you say Amen so is God calling today Faithful Men be of Courage won't you turn to your neighbor and tell them be of good courage send at your post of Duty man stand amen strong when the scholars are asking the question where are the men and amen we have plenty of males but no leaders amen God looks over to the the men and says I've given you my word I've given you my law meditate therein stand upon it amen keep it in your mind and keep it in your mouth speak these words be strong and of good courage you say but brother Wendell I there's so many failures out there I feel like a failure and so many men do feel like failures today but I I want to I I want to say as I as as we get ready to dismiss take Heart Take courage take confidence and take comfort because God's going to have Godly men that is going to bring amen that's going to lead men or lead your families can you see men if you didn't win the last round that's all right amen you're going to win this one I don't know how many rounds you're going to lose amen as a as a leader but I'll tell you this one thing here you're ordained to win and the words are still circling the world Amen take my words and if you listen to my words you'll be successful if you listen to my words and keep a right Spirit you'll be successful have not I called thee have not I commanded thee have not I said be strong and very courageous can you say Amen when when when you when when you look and sisters if there's ever a time if there's ever a time for you to be telling your husbands I love you I've got confidence in

make sure that we that we're on the straight and narrow because this job this job is not forever this situation you're in is not forever amen you're the the the time clock is not forever the alarms that you're setting in the morning to go to work and you're having to work 8 10 12 hours a day it's not forever you are preparing for that Eternal land and you're making sure that we are preparing for that Eternal land you're making sure that I that that we're honey I appreciate you being a strong leader in our house I appreci you you see that we we need to take courage take courage in this day Amen brother Brandon would say when people take God at his word and believe his promise it's so Supernatural till it becomes crazy to the people of the world God Is So Much Greater his promises his power his being his living and his expectations of us is so much higher than the things of the world until we become crazy to the world can you say Amen so what am I saying ministers take courage masas take courage daddies take courage young people take courage only be strong if the musicians would come the greatest thing that we could ever [Music] do is to disregard the leadership that God gives us [Music] when Dad is is is putting his giving his word and then you children would go to Mom and then Mom would go against dad you are you're effectively dismantling leadership [Music] mama mama should never go against Daddy's leadership when they're trying to lead their family I do I I do believe in talking you you know talk and share concerns if there especially if if you if if the husband is discouraged and going off astray then mama that's that's that's as a wife that you're a help me you're you're you're the you're to help him but you you [Music] you you the family can really can can break dad down if we're not [Music] careful and if there's ever if there's ever a time that we need leaders it's right [Music] now if there's ever a Time For Mama to let Daddy no you're needed and we really appreciate you as a [Music] family the kids and I appreciate your hard work amen how many how many not you sisters but how many of you Brothers could say that's the truth you I know I know you women I know it's listen we know that you women work nonstop and I know y'all feel unpre appreciate it but so do the men feel that they give and give and all their money goes to their pretty wife and their ugly kids [Music] [Music] but if daddy's discouraged if daddy's [Music] discouraged do you all see how that God was so Lov the family that he sent a prophet to us I just want to say every one of you mama daddy whoever you are be courageous [Music] be [Music] courageous there's not going to be [Music] a there's not going to be a great big huge Revival that's that that goes [Music] on I I I I don't believe the Revival is I don't I don't believe there's going to be [Music] a something great big something or another that's going to come I believe that we're in the quick short work you look at all of the quick short works and and that's sort of thing and brother Brenham is pointing to this Le Odyssey and age in the opening of the word so we we may or may not I'm not saying it it's not going to be a worldwide [Music] thing but I but I am saying I'm sort of at at at a little bit of a got a little bit of a back ache today [Music] what I am saying is [Music] that there will be strong men and women not not major not not major um there's not going to be mega churches all over the all over the place but I believe there's going to be little pockets just like what we've got right here of men and women like you and me that are just so courageous [Music] and maybe you're not even out performing Miracles casting out Devils or but the man knows who he is the woman knows who he is the children are appreciating what God has given them in their parents and that family is possessing the enemy possessing everything that God said was theirs you might not ever feel great big Shields coming down your spine it might I don't know what I'm saying is we're not waiting for this big something or another to come God's saying just be courageous right where you are because your next battle could be the battle that you're fighting right now to keep your spirit right keeping a right heart towards your husband keep right heart towards your wife keep a right heart towards your
