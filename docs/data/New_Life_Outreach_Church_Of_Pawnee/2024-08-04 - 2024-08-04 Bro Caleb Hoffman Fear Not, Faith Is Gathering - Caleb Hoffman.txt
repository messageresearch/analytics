buried all the shame when you made that rug tree your rightous throne and because of you I'll never walk alone and because of you I'll never walk [Music] amen you believe that tonight amen that's an extraordinary young lady right there she makes my job a lot easier amen if y'all would stand this evening praise the Lord we're going to begin in the Book of Romans the fourth chapter and the 19th verse and from there we'll go to the book of Jude the 1 chapter and the 17th verse y'all pray for me this evening my voice is a little rough in this morning so y'all just keep me in your prayers and we'll get through this Romans 4:19 it says and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead and when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb and he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform in the book of Jude the 1 chapter in the 17th verse it says but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust these be they who separate themselves sensual not having not the spirit but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ into eternal life tonight I like to take my text out of the 20th verse but ye beloved building up yourselves in The Most Holy Faith and the prophet of God would say this little lady sitting right there second one right in the back she's bought her with nervousness isn't that right lady see what I mean this demon knows if that woman will halfway believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that I'm his Prophet that it'll have to leave her and that demon was calling out to that one for help to help accumulate unbelief but he's lost the battle sure he has faith is gathering and tonight i' like to take for a title fear not faith is gathering let's bow our heads dear father Lord we come before you this evening Lord we thank you for this opportunity Lord to Lord be able to stand before these things father Lord these Believers are like Precious Faith father as we enter into this service father Lord your anointing is already here your spirit's already here we F we felt you the entire service and I ask as we enter in Father Lord to this portion of the service that you would just move in a mighty way that you would just move Lord this broken body aside father Lord and you would just speak through me Father Lord that your word would come forth in fullness and power and authority Lord and that you would meet the needs of each and every uh person in the building father we put the service into thy hands Lord I Surrender myself to you father Lord I ask that you would just come and move in a mighty ways we put the service to our hands in Jesus name we pray amen yall can be seated fear not faith is gathering the prophet would say when you're converted to Christ a love to Christ then you accumulate a faith in Christ like you would to your wife or to your husband you accumulate a faith that you walk in that faith and you just something about you something that anchors you there you see well that's the same way it is with Christ and what Christ says you believe it you just stay right with it and it just raises you right up above it and God brings it to pass and fulfills his promise amen tonight as we stand here as Believers what sets us apart from the rest of the world what sets what sets you and I apart from the rest of the world is that we believe God we believe his word no matter how dark the situation gets no how no matter how G the situation around us may be or no matter how hard life may get we have a rock that we stand on and that we anchor ourselves too and that rock or that Revelation is that God is able to perform what he said in his word if we believe that we we have faith in that we stand and confidence on that and the term believer it's only used two times in the Bible and the definition and the strongest concordance for that term is one who has kept the faith one who is fully persuaded and to trust in Jesus as able to Aid either in obtaining or in doing something and to entrust one's spiritual well-being to Christ so as Believers we are fully persuaded there is no doubt there is no fear there is no unbelief we don't stand on something intellectual we don't stand on something carnal we don't stand on a man's idea on a man's opinion or on or on a man's um we don't stand on something that's fallible but we stand in faith on a word that is never changing we stand on a word that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and you know that that scripture is something we quote so much Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's something we quote so much you know if you're raised in the message church you've probably heard that quoted thousands and thousands of times that scripture but to the believer it's not a cliche to you and I that's not just something that we say whenever times are tough to make us feel better it's not just a good saying it's not not just a nice a nice phrase that we say but to you and I it's a revelation that if he ever was God he still is God if he ever was a Healer he still is a Healer if he ever was a deliver he still is a deliverer amen if he ever opened the blinded eyes he still opening the blinded eyes if he ever did walk on water he's still walking on water if he did it once he'll do it again amen as a Believer I don't put my trust in the god of yesterday I don't put my trust in the god of tomorrow oh but I put my trust in the god that's going to meet me right here tonight amen you know I you know I I love hearing about what he did in the past I love hearing about the testimonies and what he did back there and I'm excited to hear about what he's going to do in the future you know but a presentent God or but a god of yesterday don't do me no good right now a god of tomorrow don't do me no good right now but I serve a presentent god he's God right now he's a Healer right now he's still saving Souls right now he's healing the Brokenhearted right now he's open the blinded eyes right now he ain't a God of yesterday he ain't a God tomorrow but he's a god of right now now and we stand in faith on that amen we stand in faith we stand in faith on a God that when Moses stood on the mountain and said what shall I call you he said tell them I am that I am not I was not I will be but he said I am that I am amen just tell them I am and if you do that 50 years from now I'll still be I am if you tell them that 60 years from now I'll still be I am when they're going through the storm and the rain's pouring I'll still be I am when times get tough and you're in trial and Hell rages I'll still be I am don't tell them I'm a got it yesterday don't tell them I'm a got it tomorrow but tell them I am that I am and I'm here to tell you tonight we can stand in the faith of a god that is I am today he is still I am he is still walking and today Among Us he is still living inside us he is still watching over his bride he is still living inside his bride he is still moving through the message of the hour I don't serve a dead God I don't serve that God but I serve a god that is alive today and he is living inside of me and then the prophet of God would say if he's dead why serve him he would say if he a god at times past why live for him but I don't believe that's the God I serve I believe that I can stand in faith that if he did it every one time in all history if he didn't it once he can do it again maybe he didn't do it a thousand times maybe he didn't do it a million times maybe you think that a situation you're going through that nobody's ever gone through this but I promise you if he ever did it one time in all of history he can do it again because he never changes he said Jes Christ the same yesterday today and forever and if he did it once he can do it again amen we can stand in perfect faith and it's an accumulating Faith or gathering Faith as a prophet would say and this word accumulate it means to gather to build up to assemble to amass it means to gather together and to focus on one point or on one body I believe the day we are living in there is a faith that has been gathered together and has been focused on the bride body of Jesus Christ and not only that but I believe that when the faith of the word is PL on the inside believer it doesn't just sit idle it doesn't just sit there and never move and never grow and never work but the prophet of God said that whenever that Faith begins to accumulate he says it will accumulate until it won't take no for an answer that faith will grow until it won't take no for an answer that faith will begin to grow until it'll manifest the supernatural that faith will begin to go and it'll begin to build and it'll begin to build it'll begin to build until there's no room for fear there there's no room for doubt till there's no room for unbelief and I just want to say there is no room for unbelief in this message there there's no room for fear in this message there's no room for doubt in this message there is no room for any of that second Timothy 1 17 for God had not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind this message does not produce fear this message didn't come to scare you and living a holy life this message didn't come to shock fear Into the Heart of believer I'm not living in a message of fear but I'm living in a message of faith I'm living in a message of Victory I'm living in a message of Freedom I'm living in a message that produces Divine Healing I'm living in a message that produces the supernatural it produces the will of God it still produces those things I'm living in a message of Faith amen the prophet said my faith doesn't anchor in what the coming meetings will be my faith doesn't rest and what only in only in ability that I would have or upon what church I should join or what people I should associate with my faith anchors and rest entirely upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ that has already been received he said it's already been received so you can't have perfect faith in something that's fallible you can't have unadulterated faith in an adulterated word you can't have true faith if it's a false message oh but my faith doesn't anchor in something that fails my faith doesn't anchor in something that only works for a short amount of time my faith doesn't anchor in something that has ever failed over my faith is anchored in the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's already been received it's already been received inside of me all it's doing now is building all it's doing now is gathering all it's doing now is accumulating oh Hallelujah that faith is building oh I'm here to tell you tonight Brad oh you ain't got to live in fear any longer you ain't got to live in unbelief you ain't got to live under condemnation you ain't got to live under any demon power you ain't got to live under sickness because there is a faith that has been given to the bride through the prophet of Malachi 4 he has given you a bride he has given you a faith and he has instilled an inside of you oh a common belief I see so many times I think throughout the message is that that was for brother bandom oh that was for him that was for his ministry oh they say well all that was just to draw the crowds in no that was for you to do he said you're going to do what I did that that same power that was on the inside of me brother BR said it is now inside of a bride of Jesus Christ that faith is now inside you that Victory is now inside you that power is now inside you oh Elisha didn't come and say well the god of Elijah did this and the god of Elijah did that no he said I am Elijah and I have the same power that Elijah had I had the same Authority that Elijah had and watch me watch as I watch as I as I wave my reignment watch as the waters uh split apart just like they did for Elijah watch as I do the same thing as Elijah did because I didn't come to talk about Elijah I came to talk about the God of Elijah and the god of Elijah is still here the god of Elijah is still alive the god of Elijah is still living in The Bride of Jesus Christ and there is a faith that is gathering tonight oh let sin accumulate oh let fear accumulate let unbelief accumulate let s accumulate but then going to do no good cuz there was another Force there is accumulating inside of this body T not and there is a faith that is gathering oh watch out devil oh it's dangerous oh Christians get dangerous whenever Faith begins to build Christians get dangerous whenever Faith begins to gather oh he said that Faith people say oh I'm a Christian and I believe God can but what do you do about it he said put it to work turn it loose do something something with it get out and Hunt up the devil when he says you're still hurting you say you're a liar pull a beat on him get him in the scope don't be afraid to pull the trigger cuz it'll go off sure as anything he said get out and Hunt up the devil oh when he says you can't have your feeling he says get out and Hunt up the devil when he says you can't be delivered he said get out and Hunt up the devil he said when you're still hurting and there's no remedy he said get out and Hunt up that devil oh something I begin to notice when studing on perfect faith when you look at everything the word said about it everything the prophet said about it when you you'll begin to see the faith was never designed as a defensive mechanism but Faith perfect Faith always put you on the offense always every single time the prophet said once David got that Faith he ran and charged Goliath once shamard got that charge of Faith the prophet said he jumped out of his window and ran to face 600 Philistines oh once Joshua got that charge of faith and he told his son to stand still the battle immediately changed from defense to offense I'm here to tell you tonight you ain't on defense we ain't a bde that sits in the corner and waits for sending us to pass we a't a bride that just sits around and just hides in our little cubby hole but we are our bride when he say you get out go hunt up that devil you have the faith go hunt up that devil go pull the trigger get him in your scope go hunt him up go find him oh I think it's hot time we start hunting the devil tonight I think it's our time we got searching for the devil tonight say I'm not going to wait for you to come to me oh it's time I get my shotgun it's time I get my rifle and I start hunting you oh watch out devil fear is G or faith is gathering watch out devil faith is accumulating and we're coming after you oh Hallelujah God you are not a people on defense you are a people on offense you are those you are the most powerful group of people ever to exist on the face of the earth oh the prophet of God would say you have so much power he said that you can speak a world into existence and go live on it he said the only thing stopping you is your faith if you had enough Faith he said you would have the power he said if you don't like something here you can just speak it out of existence that's the power that you have he said the only lck stoping you is your faith I'm here to tell you tonight church you can gather so much Faith you can just you can speak SI sickness out of existence you can get so much Faith you can just speak the devil away you can get so much faith when he comes to bother you you just say get behind me Satan oh get behind me Satan I have a faith that is stronger than than your fear I have a faith that is stronger than your unbelief I have a faith that is stronger than your complex you're trying to push on me I have the faith and that faith is stronger than every devil in hell oh the oh they would say that he would say that whenever he said when the weakest of Christians falls on his knees every devil in hell begins to tremble okay I'm talking about our six and seven year old boys when they fall down to their knees oh those Devils have been tormented Christians for thousands of years oh their need begin to buckle whenever you start calling on the name of Jesus when you hit your knees oh every devil in hell I don't care how much experience they have maybe that killed many people maybe that killed many good men oh but you take a six-year-old boy that'll get on his knees oh and say Lord Jesus I need your help he said every devil begins to tremble oh you think they're in power in this message think again you think there ain't victory in this message think again you think there ain't faith in this message oh just look around just look at the testimonies I can tell you testimony after testimony after testimony oh the worst of the worst the lowest of the low oh but this message got a hold of somebody's heart oh I don't care if you thought they could come back I don't care what you thought about it this message said I can get anybody I want this message said I can deliver anybody that I want this word said I can deliver anybody that I want and I can still a faith inside of them and they can have the power that brother bandam had they can have the power that Moses had they can have the strength oh that all the prophets had oh he said now it has been given to you oh Hallelujah brother bam said David saw the victory before he ever face Goliath and therefore he could stand in in faith he could stand in confidence against his adversary because he already saw the outcome of the battle oh church I'm here to tell you tonight we've already seen the outcome of the battle we already know the outcome of the war we've already seen what happens we've already seen our final destination oh so we can stand in Victory against every enemy we can stand in faith against every devil he sends our way why because we know the outcome we know where he ends up and we know where we end up we know who we are and we know who he is and we know that there is a faith Gathering here in this Tabernacle tonight and I'm here to tell you the devil you better watch out oh because I believe there are some people in this building T not that they're going to gather some Faith oh Hallelujah and they're going to run you into the ground oh this is not a church of unbelief this is not a church of fear this is not a church of doubt this is not oh a church that just goes this way in the wind and goes that way in the wind and follows after a man or after a denomination oh but this is a church that follows after the message of the hour and we stand in faith we can stand in a in a in a gathering and accumulating faith that he is going to fulfill his word amen the prophet said that little house wife he held that little baby in her arms and she wasn't afraid of the king's commandment she didn't care what the king said because she know God was able and God would keep his word and if we could only accumulate that kind of Faith tonight he said get that kind of Faith he get that kind of Faith living among us and moving in our beings moving through the church not just an emotional Faith but a real Solid Faith that won't take no for an answer know that God says so when that settles it he said it ain't just an emotional Faith you know it's really easy to have faith whenever you're sitting in church oh in the power of the Lord's move and there's oh it's easy to believe then it's easy to believe whenever everybody's on their feet everybody shouting everybody's praising it's easy to believe whenever you walk through the prayer lines and the meetings oh but what happens on Tuesday what happens on Friday whenever you're sitting at home and that complex begins to begins to rage in your mind what happens on the weekday when you're sitting at home and you've had a bad day at work oh and you just oh what happens then he said it's not an emotional Faith it's not something that can just be oh it is a solid faith and the messages of the hour is what builds up this Faith oh I'm here to tell you I'm just as strong Monday as I was on Sunday I'm just as strong Tuesday as I was on Monday I'm just as strong Thursday as I was on Wednesday oh because I am a believer I don't need a preacher to just come and to give me everything oh but I have the power I have the faith I have the authority I can speak the word oh when that Faith begins to accumulate oh it begins to build up and build up oh if you go and you read stories brother R talks about a lot if you read stories about Muhammad Ali and how he would fight what he would do was he would let the enemy come and just beat on him and beat on him and beat on him meanwhile he's sitting there and he's just accumulating oh he's letting the enemy beat on him and he's just accumulating oh he lets every emotion that he has he lets the anger just accumulate he lets that just build up and build up and build up oh until he look him in the eye and he gives him everything he has and he beat every single opponent and I say if anger will do that to a man what will the faith of a living God do that in the Bride of a Believer if it'll accumulate and accumulate oh a devil oh maybe you've hit me maybe you've knocked me down oh maybe you think you killed me oh but it ain't over yet I've accumulated faith and it's explosion time it's Rapture time it's body change time oh it's time that I defeat the Devil it's time that I punch the devil it's time that I sucker punch him right where he's needed it oh let that Faith accumulate tonight oh just let it begin to build let it begin to grow until it won't take no for an answer you know what that means that means whenever you claim healing and you don't get it you keep claiming it that means when you claim freedom and you don't feel it that means you keep claiming it oh that means whenever you don't feel good you still claim your healing when you don't feel like it you still say God said he would do it for me and I am standing in faith oh hallelujah oh if the word said it I believe it because I am a believer oh I am a believe I am a believer If the message said it I believe it if the word said it I believe it I don't believe there's any difference between the two I me a lot of people who think there's a difference there's the word and there's the message oh but their problem is they ain't got a revelation of what it is cuz if you get a revelation of this message you know that it is just as much word as the Bible is that we read and I say I maybe the Bible don't clearly state it but we had a prophet that came and that opened up this book to us in a way that we could never have imagined he came and he opened up this Bible and he said the prophet has come and he has Vindicated his word he has opened up his word to his bride and now everything that the prophet said you apply it everything the prophet said you live it everything the prophet had the power to do you've got the power to do because we are made out of bad material we are made out of word material we are made out of that material oh Hallelujah you aren't made out of material that falls apart you aren't made out of material that just will go so far and then quit in defeat you ain't made out of that kind of material oh but I'm standing before a bride I believe tonight that you're made out of word material oh I'm looking at a bride oh whenever that same material that Noah's made out of when the Hebrews 11 when it said by faith Noah built an ark I believe we're made out of the same material Abraham was made out of when it said by faith Abraham claimed his inheritance oh I believe I made out of the same word material that Enoch was made out when it said by faith Enoch took a body change we're made of the same material oh and I'm just going to say I believe Hebrews 11 is just getting started right now it's got 40 verses I can see verse 41 by faith Caleb took a body change verse 42 by faith Josh Martin stepped into his theophany verse 43 by faith there was an overcoming bride by faith oh there were some young people that were going to stand on the word by faith oh I've got some young sisters who won't be overcome by complexes by faith I'm going to have some young boys who will say I was called to stand on the word I was called to accumulate Faith oh hallelujah oh man you were made out of word material oh I'm telling I preach to a goodp people tonight you've been through storms you've been through trials I know this church has just been through a storm with the passing of a of a member and I know maybe you I know you've been through storms I know you've been through trials I know you've been through some hard times oh but there is nothing that you have been through that is greater than the perfect faith that lays down on the inside of you there is no devil in hell that could ever give you anything greater than that Faith that's down on the inside of the Bride of Jesus Christ oh hallelujah oh bringing on devil bring the storms bring the troubles bring the trials go ahead accumulate trials accumulate storms accumulate fear do whatever you want to I have accumulated faith I have accumulated Victory I have accumulated Liberty I have accumulated the message of the hour until it is living in me it is moving through my being oh Hallelujah you can stand in Victory tonight because you have gathered Faith you have accumulated the perfect faith of the perfect word amen Satan wants to do everything he can he take that Faith away from you he wants to do everything he can to tear you down oh instead of building up Faith he wants to try to break you down he wants try to do everything he can to get you out oh but Satan we're still standing tonight Satan we're still here tonight oh and you know what we Ang just still here we're still alive we're still accumulating we're still Gathering we're still building faith oh we're still moving Hallelujah you know the story of Fort McKenry in the battle of 1812 Fort McKenry it was the battle there our national anthem was wrote a very famous battle but the story that a lot of people don't really know is that major arm major armist dead was the head of former Henry during the battle and the enemy threw every rocket they had at us the enemy threw every mortar they had at us they threw every missile every bomb every ounce of AR they had they threw it at us and threw it at us and threw it at us oh until our token lay up there battered until our flag layth there wrecked of shreds oh major arm said walked up and he told his guys oh the sun had begin to street through the sun had be to come up it had been a long night it had been a perilous night oh but he told his men as the as the enemy was sitting there they given everything they had and they were out of artillery they didn't have no more ammunition and he says I want you to go get a bigger token he says I want you to go get a bigger flag he said I want you to go find me a bigger one and The Story Goes they asked him they said why would we do that the battle's over it looks like we lost why would we go get another token why would we get another flag and his response was I want them to know that we're still here he said I want them to know that we're still standing and Dev I want to tell you tonight we're still waving our token we're still waving our flag I say we're still here you threw every misad us you threw every problem at us you threw every devil at us you threw everything you had at this bride but we're still here we're still standing we're still fighting hallelujah we're still here oh hallelujah oh I'm still standing you threw everything you had and it wasn't enough you threw all your unbelief and it wasn't enough you threw all your fear and it wasn't enough you threw all your depression and it wasn't enough you threw everything you had and it wasn't enough because there is a group of people oh there is a bride that is standing in perfect Faith Hallelujah I'm going to read it again the quote that I started with he said that little lady sitting right there the second one right back there she's bothered with nervousness isn't that right see what I mean this demon knows if that woman will halfway believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and and I'm his Prophet that devil will have to leave her and that demon was calling after that one for help oh I want y'all know what's happening here okay your devil got so scared he started trying to call in back up your devil got so scared he said I can't do this alone I've got to call in more but the prophet said but he's lost the battle because faith is gathering Hallelujah and I say that if a woman halfway believing if a woman halfway believing that brother Brandon was the prophet if a woman halfway believing in Jesus Christ oh can make that devil leave I say what can that bride do there standing in perfect faith of a perfect word on a perfect message oh what can you do oh Hallelujah he said that devil knows that that woman will halfway believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and I'm his Prophet it'll have to leave her oh if a woman halfway beli him would do that how scared do you think he is of you oh man oh that makes me excited I don't know about y'all oh when a bride accumulates our faith oh it doesn't matter how many devil stand before her it don't matter how many barriers are stacked up before her it don't matter how many enemies have been stacked up before her oh she has accumulated at that Faith there is a sea down on the inside of her there is a power down on the inside of her there's a an authority down on the inside of her that with one Whisper of your breath you can destroy every devil in hell with one Whisper of your breath oh you could send them all running back to where they came from oh Bri now is not the time to be hotting in a cubby hole now is not the time to just sit around oh but it's time to stand in perfect Faith it's time to start accumulate it and say devil I'm going to knock you where you stand devil I'm going to hit you where you stand oh hallelujah oh it's time to hit the devil oh man he man if you know who you are there's nothing that can stop you he said every

Fair Hill oh there was a SK guys saying there and that same thing happened and he walked out of that t looked around and he looked at that one and he said that Wolf's going to kill me he looked at

veil roll back and I see him one that could stand to put his hand upon me a sinful man and upon a holy God and he is my propitiation he is the word that I stand for in the beginning was the word he he's that word and he represents me there amen and I'll scream it as long as I have breath he said I'm going to scream it as long as I have breath I'm going to stand on this word and he said I'll

time he went through he claimed his healing and he didn't get healed he went back through the line and the prophet asked him why are you still here he said you already said you believed me you already

healing over this and we'll lose our healing over that oh but don't you know Church who you are don't you know the faith on the inside of you don't you know the mage of the hour that came oh to say

speaking why don't you start complaining and start declaring why don't you just start standing on the word and say I have the faith if he said I'm Healed I'm Healed if he said I'm delivered I'm delivered if he says I can have total freedom I can have total freedom amen the prophet said let him that's weak say I am strong just say in your heart I now strong I have now accepted Jesus as my savior and never have any negative testimony anymore just believe it God is under obligation he said just believe it God is under obligation once you say I believe it God is under obligation to match your belief with his power oh he's under obligation once you say I have faith he is under obligation to match that Faith with his power oh he's obligated to it he said and sitting at the right hand of the father to accept who Jesus is for he's sitting there the high priest of your confession to make good before the father and everything that he died for that your confession that he done there you are Divine Healing cannot be any pler than that he said it is to the weakest he said remember God's word will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition Satan you're defeated at any time anywhere any place under any condition so why don't we just make any time right now why don't we just go ahead and make any place this building right here tonight we don't why don't just make it right here tonight and say say you're defeated right now saying you're defeated right here I have my healing I have my victory you are defeated he said once you give your confession God is obligated to match your confession Amen in another quote in another quote the prophet of God he would say about confession he would say that Gody he say you confess it and believe in his word and he said that God will make your body obey your confession all right okay your confession has nothing to do with the condition in your body your confession does not obey your body your confession does not obey how you feel it doesn't obey how you look it doesn't obey what you feel like that day but he said if you'll confess it God will make your body obey your confession Hallelujah Romans 8:35 it says who shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation or distress or persecution or or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as Lambs for the slaughter but nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor he nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord he said I am persuaded oh everything he had been through look at Paul's life if anyone had the right to sit around the M it was Paul if anybody had the right to sit on the Pew and complain it was Paul if anybody had the right to sit there and the sing what was me it was Paul but look at him oh through every single assassination attempt through every single stoning through every single shipwreck through every single lost that sea through every single trial everything in storm oh he always always had one confession I am persuaded I am persuaded I say tonight won't you get persuaded there is nothing that can sway that there's nothing that can take that away why don't you just tell them tonight oh maybe you thrown everything you got at me devil but I am persuaded amen that pers word persuaded there in the strongest it means to be most surely believed to have confidence to have faith to be fully convinced oh you look at Paul here I am persuaded in the midst of Chaos in the midst of Heartache in the midst of Trials I am persuaded in the midst of everybody trying to kill him I am persuaded in the midst of every devil in hell after him I am persuaded in the midst of every problem I am persuaded the prophet said let death do whatever it wants to it'll never bother me because I am persuaded I am persuaded that even in sness of take me or a bullet that might take me I don't know what it'll be what difference does it make oh Cale I'm going to S every devil I have at you what difference does it make I'm persuaded I'm going to send every S I have at you what difference does it make I am persuaded oh I'm going to send every problem your way what difference does it make I am persuaded oh you look the story Mary Magdalene oh she said there the prophet I've never heard anybody preaching better than the prophet oh he just dramatized it oh it just makes your heartache the way he dramatized that story oh that woman crawling to Jesus on her hands and knees your elbow in her way through feet elbow in her away oh they were splitting at her they were mocking her they were hitting her they were kicking her oh but she El with her way through and I truly believe that that day Satan had every available devil he had under one order don't let that woman get to Jesus but you know what no matter how many Devils came no matter how many many Devils there were no matter how many came no matter how many spit on her no matter how many walked her oh that woman said I am persuaded that if I can just get to Jesus Oh I am persuaded that if I can just get to my Lord I can have my healing I can have my forgiveness Hallelujah I am persuaded oh I ain't been married very long there's one thing I know if you get a fiery woman that is persuaded about something there ain't nothing in this world going to stop her and I say when this firey body of Jesus Christ gets persuaded of the word that down on the inside of her oh no devil in hell is going to be able to stop her nothing's going to be able to stop her oh I am persuaded that indeed need that no death can stop me I am persuaded that principalities can stop me I am persuaded powers can stop me oh she he was persuaded amen that was that was a joke y y'all got quiet there that was completely a joke she she takes it well it's all right the prophet of God said look at Joshua before one rock ever came out of the building of the walls of Jericho Joshua walked around the walls shouting the victory he said before one rock ever came out of the building walls of Jericho he was already walking around the walls shouting the victory for by faith he saw the Victory and he know that the walls was coming down he and his armed men walked around and around and around Jericho for 7even days in full armor doing what because he was looking at the Unseen it was a promise that God had made and now how much can you walk around that wheelchair how much can you walk around that cancer how much can you walk around sin shouting the victory that God has given the promise that when you can see him who is invisible when that pulsation comes into your heart and begins to pulsate I'm the Lord who heals all our diseases when you can see that everything else weakens away he said when you can see that he said everything else weakens away when that pulsation of Faith begins to beat inside your chest everything else weakens away when that accumulation of Faith begins to beat and begins to beat and begins to build everything else weakens away oh I say you can walk around your Jericho walls you can walk around your walls tonight you can walk around your storm tonight you can walk around the devil T night shouting the victory because God said I have given the victory amen amen oh I'm having to skipped through I'm sorry my voice is about done he said what if the people here tonight that is sick would begin to say God is God if he isn't why serve him if he's still God he's still a Healer if he's still almighty God he can do all things if he made a promise he can't break it he has to keep it and that be pulsation begins to rise in your heart and something is going to take place when that pulsation rises in your heart something is going to take place when that Faith begins to build in your heart I say something is going to take place oh we are not a dead people we are not stagnant group of people but when that Faith begins to build something's going to take place oh when that pulsation begins to increase something is going to take place oh he said something's going to take place there could be nothing stop it it's like a fire it's like a building my fire on a windy day it just keeps blowing as the Holy Spirit f that fire and it keeps burning until it becomes a reality to you I say now if you need healing if you need Deliverance if you need saving if you need Freedom I'm just going to say what the prophet said if he's still God he's still a Healer if he's still God he's still a deliverer if he's still God he's still a savior if he's still God he is still a promisee keeper so just let that pulsation of Faith oh just let it burn on the inside of you let that fire just spread all throughout your body just let that foration of Faith grow let it accumulate oh he said once you let it grow he said nothing can stop it oh nothing can stop this bride nothing can stop this word nothing can stop this message oh once he gets going the prophet of God said when you know who you are you will be an invincible Army and I say if we know who we are why do we let Devils take us oh if we knew who we are why don't we let s us get us down but if we know who we are why don't we stand in faith why don't we stand in Victory why don't we stand tonight in faith amen oh in Ecclesiastes 3:1 Solon would say to everything there is a season there's a time and a purpose to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up he said there's a time to break down and there's a time to build up you know we know in the story of Hezekiah where he requested 15 more years from the prophet and brother Brandon would say that the reason he asked for that time he said the reason he asked for that time was so that Hezekiah could break down the authors of baill and build up the altars of God you look King Josiah as 16-year-old boy okay we ain't talking about a 40-year old man church we ain't talking about some man who's well established we're talking about a 16-year-old boy had such a revelation oh that he had it in his heart the Bible says to rebuild the houses of God but before he could do that he had to First tear down the altar of Bill I'm here to tell you tonight you want start you want to know how to start building up Faith start tearing down fear start tearing down unbelief start tearing down the devil start tearing down the unbelief start tearing it all down oh before you can build up the alers of God you got to tear down the altar of bell and in the in the message faith without works is dead the prophet would say that Faith was perfected upon the altar okay so Faith was perfected upon the altar so before the altar of Faith to be built up oh the altars of fear first had to be destroyed the altars of unbelief had to be destroyed the all the altars of the Pagan had to be destroyed they had to be brought down I say tonight oh you can't build up Faith until you have destroyed everything else you can't build up Faith until you have brought down everything else oh it's time to start burning the Bridges it's time to start burning the barriers it's time to start breaking down walls it's time to start destroying the strongholds it's time oh to start standing and to say until I break you down Faith can't build up amen oh brother bam said he would say I can see shamard sitting there and he looks out oh my his righteous inding Nation begins to come upon him and he got

he had the helicopters and the dogs after him and I mean this guy this guy was was he was a he he he was a rough fella addicted to heroin he he was and and and and Aunt Angie kept on believing for her son a lot of people might have thought that Joe Green there was no hope for brother Joe won't you stand up this come on up here brother Joe this is a prodigal that God has saved and delivered and he's a trustee in our church today who would have ever been able who would have ever been able to trust you and here God has saved him you've been serving the lord now for how many years eight years seven years the Lord has has touched it was a mother that kept on believing for her son year after year after year after year do you we've got testimonies to his message here there's a reason why we need preachers to preach this cuz you ain't going to get this by just going to a church and talking about a God and there's no living God among you we've got a God here Among Us that we preach about and that he delivers sister Stephanie won't you come up here just real quickly sister Stephanie was a was was a heroin addict her mother gave her drugs for her for which birthday all of her that she would get drugs the hardcore stuff she's I mean we're talking about giving her that stuff when she was uh 12 years old and and and this girl this girl went through through laugh addicted this girl knows what it is to have abortions this girl knows what it is to be so low in [Music] life she was in she was in a hospital or when she came here she came with her liver all ate up she didn't have a liver and the doctors wouldn't give her a transplant because she was an Al she was a druggie and and they knew that that she wouldn't be serious about it she was in the hospital for for over a month with with her uh just just next to death her mom died early big due to drugs when she came to PA she was an [Music] atheist she was an atheist they when they came to Pony they lived with us for a couple of weeks she smoked like a freight train constantly smoking and and when and and she all she had was just the clothes on her back and I remember the day that the Lord touched her or doing the work she you know she basically said now you know don't judge me cuz I'm I am not she she come pretty pretty skimpy her her her shorts and her and her tank top and and uh uh and you know and sin had had had a rough she was just Skin and Bones and uh uh you know she said don't try to change me cuz I ain't going to put those skirts on and and I and I said listen you if you can put up with me I can put up with you and so I want you to come to church she didn't even she didn't even know she didn't she didn't know none of the Bible stories uh even the kids stories that you guys know she did she was your Sunday she she's a Sunday school teacher today she didn't know those stories back back when she was a girl one day she was smoking and she you know she'd go outside and smoke and and uh well anyways I'm sort of getting the stories is all mixed up but but sister Stephanie my my wife my wife had said you know she'd probably feel more comfy coming to church if she had a dress and I said and um I said well she don't want to wear those so I said I tell you what just put a dress over there you know a skirt and if she wants to wear it she'll she'll put it on well she she ends up she she ends up putting it on and and uh you know and so I my my wife called me and said Stephanie's got a skirt on and I said I said don't let her hear you say it and uh and so I said just we're just going to we're just going to let that go and and um well one day she needed to go smoke boy and she's she's just racing back and forth in the house like a Cage's lying just going around and so nervous and and and finally fres says well what's wrong with you and uh she says I need to smoke and uh she said well go smoke she said I can't I got a skirt on and so her simple Faith her simple faith I kick cuz I got a skirt on and so fresa says well you better not you better not smoke then and uh the Lord delivered her not only has he delivered her from smoking he's delivered her from heroin he's delivered her and they they both will tell you that they have been through the programs they met each other through the programs they have been through all of of those things and when Satan or when the programs couldn't help and when religion couldn't help Jesus came down and delivered them and set them free from heroin cigarettes Hallelujah now she came gave her heart to the Lord and it was just amazing when the Lord's doing things the house that I'm living in now I remember us working on that house and and you just had to stop by Fresca brought her by to come and talk to me and and she she wanted I I remember just telling you little bible stories and you were eating it up just eating it up the Miracles and and and and the day she she had to go back and get her uh she was having and still struggling with her liver and and the doctor had already you know was already pretty rough on her and and um you know really scolding her even after she got saved she said I know how your kind is and just you know for a doctor just really been rough on her and and you know you're just going to go right back to it and blah blah blah and just and anyways the time come I don't know which doctor well I I guess it was your last doctor appointment with that individual they went back done the tests again and now Stephanie didn't even ask for the church to pray this is the thing about she says I believe that what you have said that God has done for others he can do for me she she did not even ask us to pray for her when she went back to the doctor and they but they had told Joe had called me and and and and told me said now we're we're on our way be praying and we're anyway she'd get to the doctor they do the test again and the lady comes back and says your liver is perfectly normal so after so she looks and she says oh wonderful so so what now do I you know just asking about so I keep on taking the medicine and the lady looks at her and says listen you no longer have to take the medicine your liver is normal and she has not taken the [Music] [Applause] medicine if God can give a brand new liver and make a Sunday school teacher out of a out of an atheist and can make a trustee out of out of a prodigal son how much more can God do for you and me come on now this is what God's done God bless you these are these are four testimonies of people we know people here at the church

some incredible situations Denise is home right now amen they called right before church saying that she's got 200 her blood pressure is 210 over 170 amen and she already had this little stroke and and and and now when the doctors can't do anything and the doctors have not been able to do anything this has been an ongoing deal now we're either going to say well you know you know I just wish God would heal that's not the problem the healing has already been paid for we heard that this morning the healing has already been paid for it's the devil that is trying to keep you from taking your healing healing is is is just as tangible as me coming over here and picking this dry eraser up right here it's just as tangible it is I this is this is my board the I use these I wrote that there I I use this when I'm teaching I I I don't have to go and ask anybody else if I can use this board I've been used this board was bought for me to use [Music] amen now if there's a bully that wants to stand between me and the board and telling me you can't use that well no brother Donald bought that board for me to use I can use that and the bully standing there saying no I don't care you too bad

you would give it to me brother Donald already bought that board for me there's a bully between me and the board that's trying to keep me from something that was mine this is mine I've used it I'm going to use it and there ain't going to be nobody telling me I can't use it right Christ has already paid for your healing your deliverance Stephanie was a low down wretched sinner she did not have a a track record of being a Christian and Good Deeds but one month giving her heart to the L one month being a Christian and the Lord he healed her it wasn't brownie points it wasn't because she had been a Christian for so long it wasn't because she was raised in their Pew and she's got she's goody goody two shoes she was a rank sinner that believed that Jesus paid for her [Applause] [Music] healing and when the doctor said the ain't she ain't going to get it when everyone else says it's impossible when her mom died amen an early death due to all of the sin Stephanie just reached right up and took her healing W don't youall just why why why why don't y'all just look at your healing just like I'm touching this board right here it's real that's right we've just showed you this these are these are Miracles that God has done brother Joe's a miracle sister Stephanie's a Miracle my mother's a miracle brother brother uh myle is a miracle that that that man that was destined to die you've seen the cancer in his gut and and and and in his and in his neck the doctor says he must die but one God came on the scene totally delivered the the xrays proved [Music] it can I tell you that the man the man was not even a a Believer but it was another man that was working at his house or that that that had worked uh uh got acquainted with him through work and that asked for all of us to go pray pray for him while he went and talked to him about his healing and that man who is not even in a church received his healing how much more will God do that for you it's not how good you are it's you believing in the finished work of Calvary you believe that tonight now you say well brother Caleb's already preached and brother Caleb preached a powerful message and I'm here to tell you proof is in the pudding whatever you have have need of Denise if you're listening watching in tonight sis reach out and take your healing that is your healing tonight that is your healing I'm saying that I am saying that we are serving a God who has already said healing is yours Jesus Christ can do no more for you than what he already done 2,000 years ago his blood was shed at Calvary to save you his blood was shaved at Calvary to save your children to heal your body to help you in whatever situation you Jesus will never die again he's already paid for [Music] that all we do is reach out in faith and say it's mine and it's like walking up and saying it's mine healing is mine salvation is mine right faith is the substance the tangible evidence of the things hoped for and the evidence of of things that are not seen you need a miracle sister uh Angie McDougall you're needing a miracle you have to have a miracle if you don't have a miracle there's nothing that can be done and it's not whether you're good or you're bad it's not whether you've got you've got all of these the these these check marks uh uh merits and demerits it's in faith the blood makes us brings us all on an equal bases and the lord loves you sister [Music] Hy he loves you and he'll heal that liver amen and he'll bring Deliverance to you in your situation God brought our evangelist this week to let us know know that in these situations that we're facing we're facing some major major situations here brother Mitch what you're facing the doctors might not be able to do it take care of that that that sugar and the way and and then your neck and the things that you're going through and you're waiting on surgery I believe the holy spirit is able to do those [Music] things I I'm I'm I'm glad that the kingdom of God is not a socialist country where it gives crumbs to all of the meally peasants and then and then the upper class you know the in in in socialism and that kind of thing there's the poor and then there's the rich and there's no middle class and there's no there's there just you know giving and and and uh but but I'm here to tell you you are all children of the king and there's not one of you who is who was lower or higher there's not God does not respect your person it doesn't matter whether you're black white yellow green whether it doesn't matter whether you're fat whether you're skinny whether it does not matter what you are what matters is is the blood of Jesus Christ has saved you and redeemed you and the and the blood of Jesus Christ says come unto me all you that are laboring and all of you that are in need and I will give you rest I will give you healing I will do this for you you come believing me I will give it to you do you believe that tonight now I picked out I've i' I've mentioned three that the the three here that that is that is going through some really hard times amen Denise and Angie and and and brother Mitch sister s sister Applegate you know she came to the funeral and that was so kind of them to drive that 2 hours to come to the funeral uh Alba Joe's funeral and then and and then the next day uh they're in their 80s and then the next day she fell and no she came to church on that Sunday and and then uh then she broke her fell and broke her shoulder on [Music] Wednesday I went to see her and and um I I I'm I think I'm getting it all mixed up I don't remember exactly when she maybe it was Monday that she felt on anyways we went to see her and you know there she is struggling can't get up she has to use to use her for a walker and and and and to watch her there and I thought if that ain't just like that stinking devil I believe there's a real devil and there are demons that are all after us but I believe that we've got angels that are there bring healing and victory to every one of us do you believe that now I want us to all I I know this is unconventional but can can we can can we all just come up to the front here and and I don't
