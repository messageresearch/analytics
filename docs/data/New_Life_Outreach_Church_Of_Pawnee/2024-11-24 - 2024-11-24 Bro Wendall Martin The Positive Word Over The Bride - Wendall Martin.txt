And1 and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all of his enemies and out of the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my rock my Fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will I trust he is my shield the Horn of my salvation my high tower my refuge My Savior thou savest me from violence I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from mine enemies when the waves of death compassed me in the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the Sorrows of Hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress I called upon the Lord and cried to my God and he did hear my voice out of his Temple and My Cry did enter into his ears then the Earth Shook and trembled the foundations of Heaven moved and shook because he was wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his the mouth devoured Coes were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet he rode upon a cherub and did fly he was seen upon the wings of the wind he made Darkness Pavilions round about him dark Waters and thick clouds of the Skies through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled the Lord thundered From Heaven and the most high uttered his voice he sent arrows and Scattered them lightning and discomforted them and the channels of the sea appeared and the foundations of the world were discovered at the rebuking of the Lord at the blast of the breath of his nostrils he sent from above and took me he drew me out of many Waters he delivered me from my strong enemy from them that hated me for they were strong too strong for me amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father I thank you today for your blessings thank you for all of your goodness that you have that you have promised and that you have kept to your people Lord we thank you for our friends to come and to be a part of our service today we thank you you Lord for all of the faithful ones Lord who come service after service we give ours our hearts and our our thoughts to you this morning and ask Lord that you would bless Lord that you would speak to our hearts and Lord may your words of Life anchor deep within our predestinated souls father we thank you for your goodness thank you Lord for all of those that got deer yesterday Lord I think there were eight and all and and we say thank you for that and we just ask Lord now that you would give us of your heavenly food this morning and we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning amen I want to minister uh for a title the positive word over the bride amen and that truly is a positive word that is over us today amen as the psalmist wrote amen His Banner Over Me Is Love and his love is incredible as we have just read of what God done for David and David looking there at his in his situations and it looked so so incredibly uh impossible and the enemies had swore to to destroy David and to kill him but yet God in his goodness amen was not going to let the seed of God be Forsaken and destroyed and I I I want to say that every promise that God has given in the new and Old Testament is just as good today as it was the day that he first gave it amen it's a positive word amen David David had prayed and there were and there were times that amen uh uh there were wonderful times in David's life there were times that he come against the bear and the lion and Goliath and he had come through so many but this time he's looking at the whole thing all put together and how that God had a predestinated plan for him and how that he was going to be the king the anointing oil had already been put upon him he amen he was anointed to be king but yet it was a promise that was far out in the future and God all along was letting him know that he loved him and that he had a plan but on this day here stands David as the king and he's saying God has has kept his word to me God is is has has brought me through and shown his grace upon my life and there's something about when we're living in the in the Fulfillment you see a positive word amen would mean the the the Fulfillment sister juwel it's good to see you back there amen been missing you around here so a positive word would be the the the the Fulfillment it's the promise that is living right before our eyes amen that that is a amen the as brother Brandon would say it would it is the word made light he would say the life is only by the word of God made manifest life comes only by the word of God made manifest as long as it is in the book like this it can still be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being made manifest then that is light upon the word amen see that's what brings the word said so and then when it comes to pass that is the life in light light bringing life can you say Amen so so it is with the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ we are living amen under a a positive a more positive word than any other age because it was the promises that had been given given just as it was to David promises given but yet David would go through a lot of his journey in coming to the throne but when he got to the throne well blessed be the name of the Lord he could say I'm living in the light of the word and so I say today of all ages there is a people that is living in the light of the word it it amen the Old Testament Saints when Jesus was amen when Jesus was um when when he was here on the earth the Old Testament prophets that had talked about the Messiah had talked about amen the kinsman redeemer all of the uh uh all of the uh Old Testament uh uh you know statutes and and and and the the uh Ark and and the sacrifices and all of these things were pointing to a future time when the Messiah would come God on Earth amen a baby being born of a virgin but when the when the Apostle John amen begin to look back and begin to talk about uh uh what what he thought of this Christ amen there in 1 John 1 And1 he says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have hand L of the word of God Amen so he was saying it was a promise amen but guys our eyes literally seen word made flesh our ears literally heard words made flesh in fact amen our hands have handled of the very Word of Life Now how did it handle of the very Word of Life amen they ate with him they slept with him they amen they were with him in his ministry it was word made flesh I I I just want to say today amen when the word becomes positive that is God's word coming off of the pages and living in your flesh well hallelujah amen brother Brandon would say he says I like that God's promise can not fail won't you turn to your neighbor right now and tell them God's promise cannot fail amen man he says it cannot fail that's right the word is positive it cannot change it must stay the same It Was Written amen when the enemy comes in like a flood amen what did the prophet of God says amen when the enemy comes in like a flood God raises the standard Higher and Higher by bringing his word more positive and positive Hallelujah amen oh I I I I I like that this morning how I would like to preach Amen on that ever positive word of God in my everyday life amen oh when the enemy's coming in and it seems you're going to fail when it seems amen that all hope is gone just remember you've been given a word and how does he make it more positive by bringing it to pass in your life amen bringing it to pass in your life by Mak making his word more positive to you Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so I'm thankful for that here today amen I'm thankful for his promises now now I want us to look amen there in in Proverbs 4:18 amen the path of the just is as The Shining Light that shineth more and more unto that perfect day amen so so it's going to get amen our our path today is not going to get darker and darker unto the coming of the Lord but our path is going to grow what brighter and brighter somebody say brighter and brighter it's not darker and darker it's brighter and brighter how does where do we get light how does it come brighter is the word becomes more positive the word takes on flesh the word comes off of the pages well I wish somebody would preach with me right now the word comes off of the pages and made real in me amen it was the end of Israel's Journey amen where they found an Ephesians now amen there there was no placing or no positioning in Egypt for Israel amen it was part of the journey and the blood was initiated there amen but there was no positioning there was no place for them to build their own houses to have their own land amen there was no place in the wilderness God was good to them there amen they ate mana and ate ate ate angel food they they had many miracles but they could not build houses and dwell there because that was not the place that God had ordained for them but when they got to the promised land the place that God had in his mind predestinated before the foundation of the world then they could build their houses right there amen they could raise their children right there amen and I I I want you to look here today where we are at there has been a promise of redemption there was the blood of Jesus Christ amen that was shed on Calvary and we have been through Seven Ages amen of going through the Wilderness experiences of amen denominations coming and going and rising and falling there's been many of those amen type of uh of things and there has been no place for the bride to be able to build upon Amen to build a solid place of Refuge but God has promised that there was going to be a placing of the Sons and Daughters of God he promised that there would be sons and daughters with authority he promised there would rise a church that would be greater than any other church he hallelujah amen you know he promised that you know the prophet says there's been churches churches brides and churches but there must come one with all of the fullness of Christ in her I know the denominations have claimed it and fail I know others have claimed it and failed but I say today we are living in a positive word the reason for the first age is this age the reason for the second age is for this age the reason for the third and the fourth and the fifth is for this age this is the age of maturity this is the age that God's been taking you amen this is the positive to his word hallelujah can you say Amen now Amen brother Bram would say now he says there's got to come an Ephesians there must come now when you look at Ephesians you think now what is an Ephesians well he says Joshua at the Book of Joshua and the book of Ephesians parallel so what Joshua was in the Old Testament the the book of Ephesians was to the New Testament Joshua after they came through their wilderness after they gone through all of the denominational Cycles then Joshua took them across into their promised land and possession them according to what God had in his mind well that's just wonderful did you know that each one of those tribes as those as as the 12 sons of Jacob were being born amen their mama would intercede and as and and and she would amen give out a name and did you know that each name that that that that she gave uh those women would give those boys amen it was a it was a particular possession in that land hallelujah amen when she would name Ephraim that that maybe that meant corn and that was a certain portion of the land amen that they would possess there were amen it would go all the way down now here comes Joshua amen all of these hundreds of years later and Joshua is standing there under the inspiration of God and he is dividing the land of promise to those people now before that time amen they had to live on Mana before that time amen they had to depend upon God to send Quail before that time amen they they were having to ask for water and but when they got to their own land did you know the Bible says that when they got into that land the scripture says and they ate of the Corn of the land Hallelujah they were no longer in a journey they had arrived to the place I'm he Canan was no longer just a promise they were eating the milk and honey they were eating the corn of the land they were building houses and living therein it was God's promise to that people made light can you say amen amen now now brother bradam would say Amen there in Paradox he says we're we're promised according to Revelations 10 according to Malachi 4 Revelations amen 2217 amen I think he meant 17:30 and so forth that there had has got to come a an Ephesians to this there is promised it friends there must come an Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God would be M uh uh be unfolded amen it's an it's a lotsy an age that it takes place amen I believe we're here I believe we're right in the shadows of the coming of the Son of God as Joshua said before the Ephesians raised up so did John the Baptist raise up just before the next Ephesians and we're promised another Ephesians it's predicted here in scripture therefore I think we're living in Ephesians again we are promised that what was left off during those Seven Ages amen now you cannot add anything to the bi the book A A and you can't take anything from it Revelations 22:18 says so amen who will hear uh uh who will ever uh uh uh will add one word or take one word his part will be taken from the book of life and now we cannot at or take so therefore we know that Luther could not get to it Wesley and so forth the reformers knocks finny Calvin on down so forth they cannot get to it all amen but what they had was the Gospel truth but in the last days somebody say in the last days we are given the understanding or the Revelation by the word that there's going to be and to we're going to understand it because it'll come to an Ephesian age he says we're here right now a paradox amen so what is this Ephesian it's a positioning into the land of promise now now brother Brandon would tell us amen so in the oh what is an Ephesian age that's when the word becomes real to you the Vision age is when you are tasting milk and honey from the promised land what is the Ephesian age to you amen is where you are claiming your mountains in the land that God promised those guys in the wilderness could never understand it amen they talked about it amen but they feared it they talked about it but when it came C time to go into the land amen their fearful Hearts were saying I I I we just can't do it but when the age arrived when the Ephesus arri when it was time to go in there Rose an anointing and there was a Joshua say the land is yet before you amen law is gone Grace is here and it's come to position you in your Promised Land well what are you scared about here this morning This Is Our Land hallelujah amen some some some think that well amen when the opening of the word now we're just amen drinking pickle juice and eating prunes and amen and we're all defeated just waiting on the Promises of God Amen what what do you think Joshua would have said what do you think the Holy Ghost would have said amen if they would have just all got over to the other side and say okay we're here amen and I guess I guess we'll just have to huddle together so they can't amen kill very many of us amen not God would have that's not God's purpose the promise was given so that you could possess amen Caleb comes up and says listen amen it was 40 something years ago amen all right that that God gave me this promise I'm 80s something years old right now amen but Moses gave me that land Joshua I'm here to tell you I want my Mountain I know there's Giants on it I know there amen I know it's going to be a fight I know there's going to be battles I know there's going to be struggles but I am in the promise the promise has been made real I've got a positive word amen can you say amen amen now he says the trouble with man tonight that's what the trouble with the people tonight you're scared it's the biggest curse there is on the Full Gospel people or any people is is because they are afraid God made the provision turn to your neighbor and say God made the provision but you're afraid to take his word for it if you wasn't afraid tonight why you could you would take your healing by faith know that God promised it and the thing would just go Plum away from you amen he says I've noticed it that's the reason I'm such a believer in healing it was promised for the day somebody say it was promised for the day Elijah was to come with healing in his wings it's the promise for today if we can come under the positive influence of that word am now he says now I'm a Believer and such as healing I know if you can get away from the scare and get love in its place something is going to happen is that right amen don't be scared amen just accept and Trust what God has already proven to you Amen on healing he says there's sick people sitting right here now that's going to get that's going to get out of here tonight to be well there's no doubt dying people sitting right here tonight will go out of here with life to live again you know what that sounds to me like that sounds like Joshua standing up and saying listen there's going to be somebody that's listening to me that's going to go take that mountain that God's given you there's there's going to be some people dad there's going to be somebody that's going to take up amen ephra there's going to be somebody going to possess come on now we're living under the promise it's not just a promise it's a positive it is word living right Among Us amen he says praise God why because the same holy spirit that led Simeon to Christ y'all remember Simeon amen God LED Simeon to that Christ child amen Isaiah 9 and6 he laid he led him to him his hands felt word made flesh amen he was that virgin born son he says now one that leads Simeon amen LED you here tonight don't be scared to drink walk right up freely with all boldness we come boldly to the throne of God for God is faithful who has promised us

you can't drink no more amen drink till you're so drunk on the salvation of God you'll not listen to the critics you'll not listen to your feelings or any symptoms just you'll look to Calvary and say God I want to hear the roarers of Calvary that's all I hear and he says and there you are amen amen can you say amen amen do you love him here this morning amen it's a it's a it's a powerful word amen it's a word that has that has been that has been called Over You amen now now I I I want you to realize that it's not just been provided for amen now now now the the the journey everything was provided for from the journey the blood was provided for the journey amen the the uh uh the the Brazen serpent was provided for the journey the pillar of fire was provided for the journey amen but the journey was not the position the journey was not the place they could not build houses there but when they got to the land that was promised then they could have confidence that every giant Must Fall every giant Must Fall why they had come back to their position that God God had ordained for them amen I wonder tonight or this morning if the Holy Spirit could touch to our hearts amen oh my Amen to to to to place it in your heart that that this land that we're living in that we are living in under the son of man Ministry that this was promised before the body changed and that we must be in our Promised Land amen possessing that land for the Messiah to come and pick us up brother bradam says the Messiah could not come to Egypt the Messiah could not come to uh uh the Wilderness he says only when the people was in their Promised Land Israel is where the Messiah could come word made flesh now I I I I hope I I I I hope you're hearing me here this morning amen it was not any other place that the Rapture could come to except for Christ can only come to the believer who has found that promised Landen you hear me amen now we're not talking about a natural Israel or a natural this or a natural that we're talking about the place where the where the Bible says I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he will take you back to your possession now amen the Holy Spirit In You Echoes what the voice has already said now now here brother brenon would say When God says it and it echoes against the crystal Echoes against that predestinated word he said just like it does on the crystal in the radio it makes it perfect God said I'm the Lord that Health thee that settles it amen that makes it real I'll be with thee even in you to the end of the world that makes it real he's here now that's the way it is when I'm taking Divine Healing can you say Amen now I want you to understand there's a specific word for this age I will send Elijah the prophet he's going to position you this is the day the Bible says amen that Heavens must keep Christ until the time of restitution there must come amen a restoration through that prophetic Ministry amen now now are are you hearing me the promise is more positive today now I think of brother bram's confidence have y'all ever thought about brother Brandon's confidence how he how he came up am man he would stand up behind the pulpit service after service discern thoughts and hearts and always always accurate just always hitting it on the money just I mean never failing amen you you you you know you know why is because the promise of Malachi 4 was made positive to him when the angel come to him and said this scripture here Belongs to You Hallelujah this scripture Belongs to You amen he said you're going to take healing to the world Amen you're going to go around the world you're going to pray for kings and potentates now now his preacher his Pastor actually says how are you going to do that with a with just a amen a seventh grade education how are you going to do those things but brother bradam would say I believed the angel because the angel made scripture real to his heart Hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah I said Hallelujah and then and then all of a sudden he's out there praying baptizing and then the angel of the Lord comes down on the 17th person and and it goes around the country he didn't do that but he was expecting it he was satisfied because the word had become positive to him amen are you hearing me well if the word came positive to send us in Elijah how much more should the the children of Elijah for the Bible says that he would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers amen now he says he says when the angel of the Lord uh appeared that night and said I'll be with you don't be afraid what he would do he said he'd show signs and wonders among the people I questioned him I said they won't believe that he says it'll come to pass that you'll even know the very secrets of the hearts and tell them these things I questioned that he referred it back to Christ he says I'll be with you and then when I walk to the platform the sick people or something like another like that on those things I come to a positive thing I believe it what the angel told me he told me to do it I walk up because I'm walking under a positive promise well y'all ought to be smiling about right now that's the way it is with the bride because we've been positioned in this day can you say amen amen someone asked him aren't you scared am me that you're going to make a mistake what if you make a mistake amen he says I can't as long as I'm relying on him because he gave the promise can you say Amen so what caused the confidence it was though a specific word now Amen brother Bram would say when God tells you anything it's a positive truth you cannot get away from it it's got to happen someone said brother brandom aren't you afraid that you'll make a mistake um when someone comes to the platform and you tell them the wrong disease no sir you aren't you afraid here the other day there's a man arrested down in the South for telling a man he lived untrue to his wife and so forth and was arrested because it was a story why sure if it's a story anything can happen you're you're you're working in yourself but when you stand under the Divine promise of God there is no fear in God that's right it's bound to be it's perfect it's never failed it never will fail because God cannot lie man another place somebody said brother Brandon aren't you afraid of mistake a mistake how can God make a mistake certainly that angel came up here that night and said he was sending me to do this certain thing about the visions and so forth and around the world I've went with it with all kinds of people all kinds of places and not one time did it fail why I'm certain it was God oh come on little bride you've got a promise today it's not the promise of a seminary it's God that has came specifically for this day to tell you that you are the rapturing bride right he says it come according to his word it's according to his spirit it's according to his nature and it's exactly on time to Abraham's seed man how could John the Baptist be so confident when he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away to the sin of the world people all around him could ask the question look at here there's over two million people in Israel today how how will you know this Messiah how will you know he'll be an ordinary man he he'll be one of the sons of David why where where will he come from the lineage of David there's thousands times thousands of them how will you know how will you be able to introduce him to the world and know that it's him he says I have the word of God I'll know him he said one of uh there there is one standing in your midst there is one standing in the midst now who do who you do not know he will baptize with the Holy Ghost in fire how will you know John I'm resting upon the Water word because God in the wilderness that told me go baptize and upon whom I will see the spirit descending and remaining that's the one that's going to baptize with the Holy Ghost in fire he said John was was standing there he knew him not he I knew him not but he was an ordinary man he was dressed like a man he looked like a man he was a man he said I knew him not but one told me you'll see that sign and that will be the spirit resting upon Him John wasn't afraid he'd make a mistake because he knew him amen but then he stops and he says oh how can we be mistaken then when Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name you'll cast out devils and speak with new tongues and take up serpents and drink deadly things and will not harm them and they shall lay their hands upon the sick and they shall recover can you say Amen now Hallelujah now I I I want you to catch are y'all following me so far now brother bradam would say at the opening of the word amen they're they're in the they're in the Rapture message just before he passed away he actually says and I say this because it's life I'm responsible to God for saying it I must say it my message all the time knowing back there under the healing and so forth that was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come now he was saying now these signs were not the voice the signs were not the reason for me coming my purpose was to stand as Joshua and divide an inheritance to the people now now that might not mean much to you amen but it means a lot to the bride because when she knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's been Vindicated by God and that her faith is Vindicated by God it gives her faith for the Greater Works you see as long as it was brother brandham healing and Discerning you and I would sit there and think oh if brother brandham was here but he said my purpose was not for the healing and the prophecy my purpose was to deliver an open book and that is what has been given to the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ so it doesn't matter well you say well if if if there was just somebody that could discern over me you've got something more positive than discernment you've got word made flesh oh if I had somebody that could lay hands upon me some Gifted Man and that that would be wonderful but you've got something better than just someone laying hands although that's scripture and that's wonderful you've got a faith to possess healing yourself it's part of your land how's the Rapture going to take place somebody is in the living in the land of the word and possessing the Rapture believing all things are possible Hallelujah can you say amen amen now anointed one's at the end time he says my message is on my heart I must get it out that's my sole purpose oh I love that I must I know what God's revealed I've got to get it to the elect oh someone shout hallelujah if the people can get this message not that they can get my discernment not that they can have the gifts of healing no that they can have this message that they are God's people not legalism this ain't legalism this is your inheritance to believe every word of God Amen he says I've got it I must get it out that's my sole purpose regardless of what my wife says my children says my pastor says what anybody else says it's my Lord I must get that out that's my sole purpose can you say Amen what is the opening of the book what is that third pull all about remember first pool he man was was healing second pool was the Discerning of the hearts but then he all of a sudden in the third when it when the second when he got through the second pole and going into the third then God took him and showed him he was in this big old Cathedral tent type deal and amen and he's walked looking at all of his people and then he and then he looks at a little at a little room a little little box and you man he gets closer to that and people are walking in uh uh being pushed in with wheelchairs and then walking out pushing their wheelchair they're walking in blind and they're coming out healed they're walking in Afflicted and they're coming out and brother and and the angel of the Lord told Brother bran I'm I'm going to meet you in there this will be a total secret this will not be a public show then when brother Bram was preaching opening the the the the Seven Seals in the seven seal he says I hope you have understood what this week has been about this is that third pull some are saying brother R's got to get a tent and we got to go back and we got to amen we we we we've got we we we've got to get it you know the tent we got to put a box because God brother bram's going to no brother bradam says the opening of the book was the amen third pool Ministry we don't need brother brandom coming back he's he's already for well praise the Lord amen the first pool was brother bram's gift the second pool was brother branham's gift the third PLL was given to the prde it's your [Applause] gift can you say Amen we have arrived to where God has been looking the only thing left is a body change I said the only thing left is a body change amen what am I doing right now I am possessing all my land I'm possessing my children I am possessing my my wife I am possessing my healing I am possessing my victories I'm in my land now brother Brandon would say this is another Ephesians he says Ephesians was the placing or the giving of understanding of who you are can you say Amen now now remember the Ephesian age amen is where we are given the Revelation that we're going to understand because it'll come to an Ephesian age now it's your placing again what is Ephesians it is the understanding of the father's wealth what is Ephesians it is that you're having the understanding that you are his son and daughter the understanding that your father says it all belongs to you it's the bringing you to your position in The Inheritance and making it more positive when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child amen but when it came when it came time to that maturity then I can tell them all about who they are and what they are and what well glory to God when they were children they were old they were up and down and in and out but now that they they've come amen they have come to a place where they can build their houses amen and they can inhabit the land amen they can stand there upon their promise and say there is not a giant that is going to withstand me that is going to stand before me I shall overcome every one of them Hallelujah can you say Amen It could only happen at the end of The Journey it couldn't happen at the first it couldn't happen in the middle It could only happen at the end of The Journey amen and in this SE and it well you say when now Ephesians was at the beginning of the journey Ephesians was at the end of the Jewish dispensation Ephesians amen what was it it was Jesus Christ the the sinless Son of God Amen that that took the sins of the world and there was a spirit born spirit filled church under operating under the authority of that word amen but then we left that and then we fell back and then we've gone to the Wilderness but I'm here to tell you it's in Ephesians again where God is declaring I am with my people I am healing I am delivering I Am with You Hallelujah in the book of Ephesians he do you do do you realize it's God it's not not us begging God for anything it's God God's running to you let's let's look up there Ephesians 5 one and five let's just break in amen hallelujah having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of whose Grace see it's all in God's plan for you to be with this it's all in God's plan for his glory to rest upon you to the praise of the glory of somebody say his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the it'll never be by your works you'll never earn it you'll never be able to get God's attention any other way than through faith God's predestinated you to it amen you you say oh I if I was just good enough I if I was just good enough that I could pray and God would hear if I was just a better Christian why don't you come to the understanding why don't you have another Ephesus why don't you get a divine revelation that you you are the one that God died for so that you can possess every land well if I could ever that's a Wilderness mentality that's Wilderness means confusion confusion I'm confused don't know if I'm up don't know if I'm down don't know if I'm pleasing don't know if I'm not pleasing I want to tell you today I am pleasing to the Lord because there is a blood sacrifice for me can you say Amen now I know there's got to be repentance and I know there's got to be those thing we got to keep ourselves pure and clean that does not change that does not take you in and out of the Promised Land once you're in that promised land that promised land is yours stand up and fight and whom to the praise of the glory of of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in his beloved in whom we have Redemption Redemption Redemption taking us back out of Egypt back to the land that God gave Abraham in the beginning Redemption taking us back amen from Rome and all of the filth and bringing us back to what was in God's mind at the beginning Redemption bringing us back to what he had in his mind can you say Amen we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins and I'm so glad he said according to the riches riches I can't get over it riches somebody say riches Riches of his grace you think you'll ever be able Amen to to siphon all of God's riches out of his his grace his bank amen what God has God is the Abundant of riches God amen is the Supreme he's the source he's The Giver he's hallelujah amen now watch amen it says where in he hath reluctantly now he's talking to the Ephesian Church you're at a position here you're at a place to where you can act as God would want you to act and understand wherein he has a bounded toward you in all wisdom are y'all hearing me abounded what's that word abounded amen came running what's that word abound amen hallelujah abound you know I mean here's here's here's a giving praise the Lord amen here is a giving there's a promise Hallelujah but this is abounding this this is abounding it's it's God throwing everything that is God this is coming up and saying I wish I could be healed but this is God just throwing everything right on top of you and saying come on it is yours this is what you're created for this is what I died for this is what I'm looking for you for believe what I've given you it's the riches of his grace we're not begging God for anything we're not asking God in a in a Beggar's mentality we're standing up and saying this is my land and devil get off my land we don't come up and say please we come up and say get off I'm positioned in the land it's my land did not brother brand say the title deed was the opening of the book are you hearing me now so the giving okay so wherein he abounded someone said and and I used to say it all the time myself well and I was dead wrong you used to say well the closer that God comes or the the closer we get to the coming of the Lord and as Grace lifts from the USA then we're going to find it harder to have our prayers answered you know I I it it might sound good in theory but just because are you those that those that are making that and I used to make that statement well you know just harder that's the reason why it's harder to pray it's the reason why it's harder to believe it's be because it's just Spirit of the Lord's lifting you United States I I I I I want to tell you the spirit of the Lord's lifting from the United States but he he'll never leave that bride he'll never leave that bride and the prophet says that this Ephesus must come why did he parallel Ephesus with Joshua go read Josh Joshua was dividing the Joshua is where you read of all the accounts of of War the the accounts of overcoming the accounts what they were in their land and the Holy Ghost has come and there was a which is the which is that Promised Land but the word had to come to position you in that land Pentecostals out there they can they can they can they can dance around Jesus name they can jump and they can shout and they can do all of that kind of thing there but until they've heard of Joshua to place them tell them what the Holy Ghost is there for well they're just nothing more than another denomination but the elect is saying hey this is my land I don't beg for it God's not left me I know there's a bunch of giants in the land but I'm going to ni name every one of you Hallelujah can you say amen hallelujah yes sir now now if you would go back to that uh that last verse we read there sister keys I think the seventh or eth verse wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence now what is he abounding what is he trying to do what is God trying to do why did Brother Bram says Ephesus is the same in the New Testament as Joshua is in the Old Testament where in he got bound to toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his plan according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself Christ died and that was the beginning that's the beginning of the journey justification sanctification yes I'm glad to have the Holy Ghost but the whole purpose for all of those three stages of Grace is so that I can act with confidence in the land that God's given me and for those of you that don't believe that well we don't need a prophet we've got the we've got justification sanctification and the Holy Ghost then why did they have to have Joshua it was their land it took a prophet to say Gad don't you get over there on on ephraim's land hey get get you you you stay in your as long as you are in your position you have a right to build your house and you have a right to I don't know about you but the prophet of God in the adoption series he says there wasn't even a Red Cross following them around he says amen when they were out there fighting there was no one dying there was no the amen that why because the angels of God were over there amen they they they were ministering healing to their little boo boos and their cuts and their scri oh come on Church why because God was proud that there was a people on the land and that was taking their place in the promised land and if there is somebody that needs to stand up today and say I'm going to take my position and let the angels of God come down and minister to me when I'm hurting when I'm when I'm needing healing I'm going to possess this is my land and you ain't keeping me out of it can I hear a great big amen amen having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his purpose good pleasure which he has purposed in himself let's read another one I love this whole thing now I love this that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together and by the way he's that's a prophecy today he might gather together all in one uh all things in Christ which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh I do are y'all catching the the drift here according to the purpose that he has purposed in himself after the counsel of his own will he keeps coming back what whatever plan he has here is what he is looking for his matured Sons and Daughters to accept you're not under you're you're not in the wilderness anymore you're not in Egypt anymore amen you're in this land and I'm here to tell you that inheritance is yours and it's not according to your Works it'll never be according to your Works it'll always be according to my divine power and if you'll believe me and trust me and walk with me amen I'm giving you a positive word that you'll overcome you'll defeat your enemy can you say Amen you've been given an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the counsil of his own will Amen brother Brenham would say now he say now this is how this is this is how close it's getting as I go toward the wall that wall my shadow from a light the shadow becomes more positive and positive until it fades into the perfect me and as the coming of the Lord is coming to the Earth his presence is drawing closer and closer until we finally blend in with him and the spirit will take us with him can you say amen amen uh putting on the whole armor of God he says God just brings his word more positive all the time he don't have to refortify it and bring something else in he just makes his word more real all the time when the enemy comes in like a flood and the spirit of God raises up a standard against it amen then if the enemy comes in like a flood God's fortification to his people to fortify them is God's word he just raises the word a standard against him just like the word in the beginning was spoken to us in the Garden of Eden amen the spoken word the second time it was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the third time it become part of us in the Holy Ghost dwelling in us God coming into the man the first was the word the enemy tore it down the word was made flesh he was crucified but now amen there's a difference in the word the word is become the church and the church is the word God hallelujah he says now God doesn't have to do any more to his makeing get more appealing the only thing he has to do is just raise up a standard of his own word against the enemy and now what does he he when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God has raised the standard against it what does he do he makes the word that he's already SP uh spoken more positive taking the same word and making it more positive uh uh uh uh uh you know what you know what brother brandom says are we doing all right here this morning amen what brother brandom says here says after you've recognized the very word of God was Eagle food then you left all the other you have been formed into the living image of the Living God he says you have heard from your theophany he says this here is just the negative but the positive and the closer we're getting to the Rapture the greater the positive is the positive is saying you are Sons you're not going to be you are Sons this is the season this is the anointing the anointing on the earth is adoption anointing what is amen the Apostle Paul says when the fullness of the adoption comes these bodies are going to be changed amen we're not going to be oh sick and sorry and gray-headed and fat and ugly anymore we're going to be young men amen young women we're going to be rising why what yeah yeah that's going to be everybody's been looking forward to this but there is a positive word the angel of God is anointing me saying that that's my word are y'all not understanding what I'm saying here this morning they did not have that promise in the wilderness but in that days when the angel of God came down and says I'm anointing you to defeat every giant amen man now who is this MZ deck he says now this body is subject to the spirit you've not entered into that word form but we're still in the flesh form just subject to the word death in this flesh will take us then he says now am man uh uh let's see I'm not going to read all that but he just do one down he says as sure as there's a natural body being formed there is a spiritual body to receive as soon as it gets there and when a man is Born Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit babe in Christ and then when this robe is dropped there's a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of woman that we go to then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died and preached to the souls that were in prison turned back into that theophany oh marvelous thank God Second Corinthians 5 And1 if this body Earthly body be dissolved the Earth the Earthly Tabernacle we've got another one amen we he says we have bypassed that we come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did and but when the testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world come on now come on now amen this is more positive it's becoming more positive it's in every it's this is An Occurrence that could only happen in this day amen I'm telling there that word body is so close to you pulling you pull oh God hallelujah no wonder we're happy no wonder we Rejoice no wonder when everything looks crazy we believe the word of God can you say amen he says we are here here we are formed to the word image to be partakers of the word feed on the word by predestination since the beginning of time then if I'm here I'm going to start possessing you know one of the things that that that that that stands out to me and I and I have I have talked about this many times but one inherit one one one The Inheritance that was very specific from brother brandham that was very pafic he says your children are your inheritance let let me let let me let let me take you another place another thing did you know that the brother Bram says after the church is positioned they know who they are and what they are the prophet says they're not just standing there in that land he says I'll just read it to you he says after the church takes its position this is adoption four we are called to the adoption of sons by the Holy Spirit when each man takes his position what God has called him to do to stand to the end of the road going after the lost now if you were to to read because he's doing this all through the adoption series he is talking about Abram just before he melt met he met MDC and MDC gave him communion how many knows that we're fixing to go to MDC we're fixing to have the marriage of the Lamb amen and our King is going the Bible says we he's going to serve us just as MDC served a a a communion to Abraham right are y'all following me he says Abraham before this Abraham was going after lot lot was taken captive lot was down there amen the Kings had all got captive in his backsliding condition and he says he went after lot and his family and brought him back and God was so pleased after that I I just want to tell you that MDC was right there with Abraham fighting the battle with him I promise you that Abraham was doing God's bidding now I I I I I think I don't think I believe with all of my heart that the voice of the bride in her position stands before for God when two omnipotents come together and agreeing on God's word God the omnipotent given it you the omnipotent believer who has the you're the only one that has the ability to believe God's word lot don't have the ability to believe God's word he knows he's he knows he's wrong he knows he needs to get right he knows he needs to Hallelujah but it's an Abraham that goes after a lot backs well praise the Lord amen now brother says who was this man who was he he never had a father never had a mother he never had when he began a time when he died he met Abraham coming from the slaughter of the Kings what was he doing he went out to get lot his lost brother and to bring him back and he slaughtered the Kings and which them Kings had slaughtered I believe 10 15 Their Kingdoms but Abraham armed his servants went after him separated himself by night and he and and when he caught him in the night time oh brother we're to work in the darkness now the only light we have is the Gospel Light but he separated himself and caught him and brought him back and on his road back after the battle was over can I hear an amen he says Genesis 14:18 and MDC now that's Abraham returning now from his Slaughter of the Kings come come back on his Road bringing back lot and all the people that had taken away and then he says all like David who went and got uh the what what what did David do he took the little slingshot and went out and grabbed the little lamb out of the lion's mouth think of that slingshot going out after a lamb who in the world would do that tell me what man in here would do that rise up and you're you know raise up your hand I'll tell you right quickly you're wrong you didn't see me put mine up no I wouldn't go after him with a 30 odd six hardly but we but he went after him with a slingshot a little piece of leather like with two strings on it wind it around and when it came time for the goath he made to make us boast he went out after Goliath said the god of Heaven that let me let me deliver a lamb out of the mouth of a lion out of the mouth of the bear he knew it wasn't a slingshot it was the power of God that was with this is adoption folks this is adoption this is what brother branam is saying no man is able to do this but in your position in your placing there is well I just want to shout hallelujah I am not in the in the land of the Philistines amen without a commission I am here in this land and I am under a commission and I say today I'm coming out after every lost man and woman I'm claiming my brothers and sisters I'm claiming my wife and my children I'm claiming the wavered ones you say amen he says that's what we say today God's got some David sticking around yes sir that's feeding father's sheep once in a while a tumor will come a cancer will come something and
