everything that is done and said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here this evening and um we are uh back in the church age book and I we're going to start here on page 274 and um going to going to deal with the white Throne judgment now last week we um we had ministered on uh Mercy versus judgment and uh we want mercy and God has provided Mercy to his elect and um and and mercy should be something that we're very thankful for amen now we I when I say very thankful we ought to be very very thankful that God shown us mercy and um because he has been so very good to us and um by showing us his Mercy now we we spoke um uh last week and how that we are being judged right now and you remember the scriptures there in in 1 Timothy uh 4 and 24 some men sins are open beforehand uh going before the judgment and some men they follow after and so uh so we're going to see tonight that that there is the white Throne judgment uh that the majority of the people of the Christian World believe that that's that's where we all will appear but we're um the the The Sinner and the saint but we we uh are not to to appear before that white Throne judgment because our sins have been judged amen by the the cross of Calvary and so amen and so how how does faith come faith comes by hearing hearing by the word and so we that's the reason there in first uh Peter 4 and 17 we read last week the time has come that judgment must first begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God so so remember amen um matters of fact s kees if you'd put that John 5:24 up there there is no more judgment to come amen for the for the believer and that's the reason why amen make sure our garments are spotless here uh John 5 and 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath present tense everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation or judgment amen but is already passed present tense has p is passed from Death unto life he says verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead children hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live now he's given the two distinctions there's two there's two times coming there's one that's coming and there's one that is and those that are hearing shall live for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to to have life in himself and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man Marvel not at this the the hour is coming in which all the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth and they that have done good under the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the the resurrection of of damnation so there there is two resurrections that are taking place the Jesus is saying he that hears my word has already passed from Death unto life now there's going to come one to where the judge judement there's there will be amen the white Throne judgment and that's what we're going to be dealing largely with here tonight so I want to say Lord don't let me stand before the white Throne judgment I'm going to be there and I want to be there but I want to be there with the Lord Jesus Christ ministering to him amen how many believes that's all right and so uh uh um I I love this here it says SEC there in 2 Corinthians 5 21 says for he hath made him to be sin for us somebody read it with me for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him amen oh doesn't that make you want to shout hallelujah praise the Lord and so so uh so we as we get get ready to look into this amen I I want us to to remember we are judged in Christ Jesus we as I as I was saying Sunday amen we came from Christ we were part of Christ the husband come to redeem his wife Amen to bring this wife back to him that's his whole goal there in in Ephesians 5 and 25 it says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that they should be holy and without blemish so want men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loves his wife loves himself amen aren't you glad for that so now this this message has brought to us that we're not trying to become there is a predestinated seed within you to become and I want to read one last thing before we get started in our reading here in in The Invisible Union of of the Bride Amen brother Brenham says now now now notice the anointed word of his day of which you are part by predestination you immediately like knew when you heard that you knew right quick that you was an eagle you also realized that you wasn't a denominational chicken to begin with you know there was something wrong there there is something wrong that's right for you know that you were trapped into it at the beginning but he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which foreordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church no that does that don't sound right does it you might find that in the almanac but not in God's Bible you are Washed by the word he says you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned in the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus and if you're perfect how can you be judged as a sinner he says if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place I cannot die for that sin someone somebody took my place and Jesus the word took my place become me that I a sinner might become him the word he says let me hold true to it not the church the word all that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming the word and the word word is becoming the flesh manifested Vindicated can you say Amen to that amen so there is a judgment that is going on right now you're that word now remember the blood has washed you and now the word is telling you who you are and that blood is still there the word as you're beginning to grow in the Lord and the blood the the word of the Lord tells you hey this is what God likes God doesn't like that attitude well what are you doing you're taking God's blood and you're washing that you're washing that spot off amen when there's when there's things that are that are going on what are you doing you are you are you it's your desire to please him but you never could please him you never could you that law could never be lived in and through you amen but now the righteousness of God through Christ has come back upon us and I want to shout hallelujah thank you Lord for your grace now let's look here and and we're going to look at the very last paragraph as as brother brandham um is dealing with the um the the white Throne judgment it says there is another Point here to see and this is Page 274 last paragraph in that great white Throne judgment there will be a separation of people the book of life will be opened and another book will be open Matthew 25 and 31 1- 46 when the son of man shall come in his glory all the Holy Angels with him and then uh shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divides his sheep from the goats he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left hand then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from before the foundation of the world for I was a hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty you gave me drink I was a stranger you you took me in naked you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and ye came to me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee and hung hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as you have done it unto the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me then shall he say also unto them on his left depart for me ye cursed every or into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was a hunger you gave me no meat I was thirsty you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they answer also also answer him saying Lord when saw we thee and hungered or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee and he shall answer them saying verily I say unto you in as much as you did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous unto ever uh uh unto life eternal Revelations 20 11-15 I saw a great white throne and and him that sat on it from whom from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was no place found for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which was the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which which were in it and the death and Hell delivered up the death the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death whosoever was not found in the book of life was cast into the Lake of Fire there will be both the righteous and the unrighteous in this judgment it says so these righteous will not be the bride for the bride sits with him in judgment 1 Corinthians 6:2 and3 do ye not know that the Saints shall judge the world if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest manner know ye not that we shall judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this life Revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne see the bride is with him in the throne as she is to judge the world she has to be sitting in judgment with him that's exactly how what Daniel saw Daniel 79 through 10 and I beheld the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did had sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth uh from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him I want you to remember or maybe even just circle that unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood be before and then you can Min you can also Circle that before the Judgment was set and the books were open see in at the same scene thousand thousands are ministering to him are the bride for who ministers to the husband but the wife the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the Judgment there is no other place that they can come up for there are but two resurrections since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is a resurrection under judgment the ones who qualify for the first resurrection the bride are not in the Judgment John 5 and 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life that is the believer is already the recipient of eternal life which he has in possession now and shall not come into condemnation shall not come into judgment is what it really says but is passed permanently from Death unto life but notice carefully Jesus must have yet another group in mind who at a certain Resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at the resurrection not H not having previously received it as a member of the Bride John 5:28 Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good under the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now we all know that John 5:28-29 is not the Rapture for only the dead in Christ shall arise from the graves at that time along with the living bride who is still on the earth 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord but in John but it says in John 5:28-29 that all are going to come forth from the grave this is very this is the very same resurrection that is spoken of in Revelations 20 11-15 wherein the dead were brought forth before the Lord judged according to their works and all whose names were not written on the Book of Life were then cast into the Lake of Fire we now face the question as to why they should be given eternal life after the Judgment since the Epistles seem to be conclusive seem to conclusively point out that one must possess the spirit of Christ or perish though it seems thus we must not discredit the words of Jesus who most pointedly sets forth that there are some found in the Book of Life who will either receive eternal life before the general Resurrection or after it now Paul does not evade this Truth for he most clearly says in Philippians 3:11 if by any means I may obtain to the resurrection of the dead now this statement is most peculiar we all know that we are all going to be in the resurrection whether we want to be or not all will be resurrected so Paul could could hardly be saying if by any means by any means I might attain to the resurrection ction of the Dead the truth of the matter is he's not saying that the literal reading is this is if I if by any means I might obain to the out Resurrection from among the dead that is not the attaining to the general or the second Resurrection but the attaining to the first resurrection uh of which it is said blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second that is at the end of the Thousand Years when all the rest of the Dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those who are caught in the second death now we do not need to guess about those who in the second Resurrection or given life we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they have been kind and good to the Brethren those who are raised and cast into the Lake of Fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the Brethren since this is the word of God we simply accept it there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact to further clarify notice specifically the words of Matthew 25:31-46 it does not say that a Shepherd is literally sheep separating sheep from the goats but it is a as a Shepherd dividing sheep from the goats these are not sheep in this particular uh area of time the white Throne judgment the Sheep are in his fold they heard his word the his voice the word they followed him they have already have eternal life and cannot come into the Judgment but these do not have eternal life and they are in judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds do they enter into eternal life certainly not upon the fact that they already had his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren they are not his Brethren that would make them join HS with Jesus they are not HS to anything but life they share No Throne Etc with him their names have been in the Book of Life and not removed now because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gale who stood for the children in in the time of trouble if if this seems to smack restoration watch carefully now for the wicked are not restored but turned into the Lake of Fire uh into the Lake of Fire the names of many of those destroyed were in The Book of Life also but they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of God who were living the Living manifested Word living Epistles for their day let us be very clear here these are not Nations being judged and going into the billennium because they have harbored and helped the Jews that is very clear because of the conclusion of this of these verses and these the wicked shall go away into Everlasting punishment Lake of Fire but the righteous unwe everlasting life there is no record of two judgments set where the wicked are cast into the Lake of Fire only the Beast and false prophet are judged at the end of the tribulation no this is the white Throne judgment they are judged according to what is written in the books it is the second resurrection that the souls under the altar as set forth in the fifth seal Revelations 6:9-11 are given white r robes and of course eternal life and or there would be no point of white robes when he had opened the fist seal I saw under the altars The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held they cried out with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a while yet for a while a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren should be killed as they were and should be fulfilled now note particularly here that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony of Jesus they were not like Antipas who was slain for holding fast his name these are not born again ones with eternal life as their possession they come up in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word notice how these are crying out for vengeance they cannot be bride material the bride turns the cheek and cries father forgive them or forgive them Father for they know not what they do these are chws they have to be because they are in the fifth seal it is the fourth seal that the bride is gone up in the Rapture so these Jews aren't born of his Spirit they don't even believe that Jesus is the Messiah but as they were blinded by God for the Gentile sake God gave them eternal life on the grounds that though they could not come to him yet they were truly faithful to all the word they knew and died died for it as multitudes died under Hitler Stalin Etc and will yet die so so you now the these are he's given us the two classes of people there's going to be those that were good to the bride going to be given eternal life just because they were good to you how many how many when you think about that you just you it makes you it makes you want to be kind to people makes you want to just be very salty because you your life to them you your your uh a testimony and them being kind to you will will someday pay off in the future and then the next one and this is where a lot of theologians uh a lot of them uh matter of fact most every commentary that Ive that I have read uh they always look to those Souls a lot of them look to those Souls that amen um you know they were Christians just waiting but brother Brandon brings it out that no God blinded the eyes of the Jews so that we could have salvation and then God rewards them with eternal life now they lost their Nation the Jews what they're going through right now I mean they listen they had to pay for their sins they they had to pay for it but those faithful Jews that have been doing their best uh uh to to to follow Jehovah and his word in in in the best that they know even though they're blind to the Messiah God gives them eternal life the good thing about it is is once the bride is gone did you know that the Jews are fixing to receive the same gospel that you have and will be filled with the same holy ghost that you and I have been re have received amen sister Tracy we missed you on Sunday God bless you back there amen so all right so let's let's go on down here to this um to this next paragraph it is the second Resurrection so those are the two remember the those that were good to the bride then the Jews now he's talking to the five foolish virgins it is the second Resurrection where the five foolish virgins come up notice they were virgins they did not have the Holy Spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five who had oil become part of that bride but these people being separated god-loving people trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end of time they will miss the Millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed are you catching that it's much more important all these people have their names in The Book of Life and their names remain but whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the Lake of Fire now let us go another step but before we do let us review our case thus far first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election Can someone say Amen it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bribe she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was forn and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her Romans 4 and8 blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she will be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even the Angels her name each of her members was written in a section of the Lamb's uh book of life before the foundation of the world secondly there is another class their names were also in the book of life and they will come up in the second Resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous are spoken of in Matthew 25 in this class also are those who do not worship the beast but or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride and not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life thirdly there are the bordering Christians such as we saw in Israel coming up out of Egypt these have their names in The Book of Life and their Works were written in the books these have failed to obey God being void of the spirit and though even the signs and wonders were amongst them will have their names removed from The Book of Life amongst this group will be the ones like Judas who though entirely void of the spirit but are religious will have manifestations in their lives and though on the books were not elected in him uh such as balum will will be in that group fourth and finally are the ones whose names have never been or will ever be written on the books such are found in Revelations 138 and Revelations 178 all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world the Beast which thou sawest was and is not shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell upon the Earth shall wonder whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was is not yet is Jesus said that a certain group would accept one who came in his own name that one is the Antichrist that is exactly what he says of them in Revelations 138 And1 178 these were ordained of God but not unto election with this group is such that are as Pharaoh it says of him even for this same purpose have I raised thee up vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction Romans 9:17 and 22 none of these would be placed on the records of life I'm not saying that there is no record of them no doubt there is some kind of record of them but not in the books of uh the records of Life their purpose of existence has been dealt with slight ly in the rest of this book um but we can add two more scriptures Proverbs 16:4 the Lord hath made the wicked for the day of evil job 21 and3 the wicked is reserved unto the day of Destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of Wrath since this portion of the word is hard for the human mind to grasp it must be accepted and be believed by faith some will be offended by what I have set forth because they failed to understand the sovereignty of God which sets forth that God is God and because he is God one cannot defeat his counsels or thwart his will and purpose but he being omnipotent is ruling in all Affairs and is doing whatever he will with all his creation because all were created for his good pleasure therefore as Paul says if God should take one lump of uh take one lump of clay and make of that same lump one vessel unto honor and another vessel unto dishonor who can be offended and cry against him that he has the right to do uh that that he that he has the right to do this on the grounds of creation alone we cannot deny yet he went even further according to Roman Romans 14 7-9 we have the ref irrefutable proof that Jesus Paid the purchase price of the whole world therefore he can do as he Wills with his own for none of us lives to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords for this for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living this is ownership not relationship is meant here this is also set forth in John 17:2 as thou Hast given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou Hast given him now if we impute omniscience to God we must also accept that he is perfect in wisdom and righteousness this plan of election and reprobation is the wisdom of God revealed in all ages even as it is said in as it says in Ephesians 13-11 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded Us in all wisdom and prudence and having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on the earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestined uh predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all all things after the counsel of his own will thus if God has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in the section of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that if it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of life but in the for knowledge of God they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept them that if there are those names if if those if there are those whose names were never placed uh on the record of life we must accept that also and if there are those who will enter into eternal life after the white Throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect who are his Brethren then we can not but accept that for who knoweth the mind of the Lord that we should instruct him rather let us subject be subject in faith to him who is our father and live can you say Amen Now isn't that a powerful reading yes that's that's a that's a powerful reading now it's it's an incredible thing you you know well the the the the natural mind would say well then I'm not going to miss it one either way I want to be good to all of God's people and that way uh uh so if I don't if I don't make the first boat I'll take the second boat well you know I don't like that kind of attitude I I'm in love with the Lord Jesus Christ you know it's it's a love affair and and I and the reason I I I read that where brother brandom says this is this is this is the groom this is husband and wife this is uh this is God's God's desire it's it's it's God's God's whole plan the word your word you know if I'm if I'm God I'm word and My bride is word amen and and and Satan come in through the flesh to to pull her off I want to redeem her back and so he's got to come come and take on flesh so when brother bradam put it and it's so beautiful I have never heard another preacher ever put it the way brother bradam put it it was the word that bled it was the word bleeding for you to wash away all of everything that was held against you then then we should then then it should it should it should drop all resistance from us there should be no resistance well I don't well I it's it's love and you can't resist love now your wife will res can resist you if it's all laws and and and negative and you know there there ain't a person there ain't any person that'll that'll that'll willingly give themselves to just um a a a criticism and um and and telling them what they're doing wrong all the time that and that's not what the Bible that's not what the what God is put in the Bible it's just not that way the law was put in there to let you know that you cannot live it there's no way you could do this in yourself so that Christ could come and express himself to you you see what I'm saying even in the heart preaching even when the even even and brother brandom can can preach but I I I've never I've never taken brother brandom's sermons I don't care whichever one you think is the hottest I've never taken that as brother brandham putting me as a bride down and telling me how worthless I am he is saying come out from underneath the shadows of Babylon that's making you feel your good in your own Works he's saying come to this word believe it don't resist it accept it by faith and say be it unto me that's how that's that that's how Mary got pregnant not resisting it but saying be it unto me amen and I want to be that kind I I want I I I want to be that kind of a husband to my wife amen uh uh uh to to to to to my my my love for her amen Even in our disagreements where she can't see eye to eye with me and if I know I'm right then God give me the grace to be to leader and and to show and to show her that this is not Uh u a male chauvinistic thing but I've got to lead my my family I must lead my family my wife is not ordained to lead my family I'm the guy that's got to do it and and I and it's I'm not on an ego trip but I've got I I'm want to make sure that we're successful wives that's the way y'all should look at your husbands listen you know we as guys weren't we we didn't ask for we didn't ask for the respect we weren't born asking to be a man or to be a but that's apparently that's what God wanted because we're males Hallelujah and um and so I heard one of the executive things that Trump put out there is males are males again and females are females again so that's good so we got that all taken care of now uh uh so so now males need to take care of what God called them to be and females need to be what God's called them to be amen but us guys as Leaders oh how we should be how how we should reflect that love that Jesus reflected to us that's incredible folks while we were yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly help me Lord amen amen so let me be that kind uh uh of an individual amen we're the presence of the Lord now I'm I I so I I broke it loose there because um because we're fixing to get in uh this this other this other one is going to be really meaty um and and and and brother brandom is now going to take this next reading is going to show how that the names were put on for a specific purpose and how they come off and and he's going to go through denominationalism had their place how they were the carriers of the seed and how that it had to come through Luther and it had to come through Wesley it had to come even though uh uh it was the organization that was that was holding that seed and going on up and going on up but the truth but they weren't the true seed now they were they were they were a part of the elect of each age but but the genuine seed time could not come until the Rapture time and this is the Harvest Time right here and this is the most beautiful time that's the reason why the Mysteries are being unveiled to us so that you can recognize what you look like oh you now how are you going to do it if if if you're under judgment how are you going to be free to live everything that God's called you to live if you're under condemnation amen and that's the right that's why if if if you're hearing and you need to hear it I need to hear it we need to hear that screaming back get in line we need to hear that screaming out amen get away quit quit quit uh uh uh leaning upon this and that come straight to the word and believe only what that word says but I will say only the elect can do it my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow they have to that's what God is called and so he's coming to pull you back woo you back to himself to make you part of him can you say amen amen so so as we get ready to dismiss amen and um uh I you remember he he says these he says he Christ loved the church gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should should be holy and without blemish now watch he says he says um he says Jesus the word took my place he become me a sinner that I might become him the word all that spiritual union of Christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming word the word is becoming flesh manifested and Vindicated he says you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know nothing it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of the existence and even in the mind of God you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated word bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was the Great great attribute of God Called Love he says because there's only one thing could do it that would be God come down himself took your place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ washed you by the water of the the washing of the Water by the word the word not a denomination the word wash you you don't stand in the water but if you don't stand in the water of the word then how are you going to be washed you're still as spotted as evil was but oh dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom Church of God be saved to sin no more what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in God which is the word pure unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word the word became blood the word bled for you you are washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God in the word the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be
