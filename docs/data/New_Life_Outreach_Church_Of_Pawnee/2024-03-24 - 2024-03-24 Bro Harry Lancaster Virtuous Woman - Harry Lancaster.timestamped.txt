[38:51] and take up our Bibles and we're going
[38:54] to turn to Ruth chapter 3
[39:17] Ruth chapter 3 and we're going to start
[39:19] at verse
[39:26] 10
[39:30] and he said blessed be thou of the Lord
[39:32] my daughter for thou Hast showed more
[39:34] kindness in the latter end than at the
[39:36] beginning in as much as thou follows not
[39:39] young men whether poor or Rich and now
[39:42] my daughter fear not I will do to thee
[39:44] all that thou requirest for all the city
[39:46] of my people doth know that thou art a
[39:48] virtuous woman let's turn to Proverbs
[39:52] chapter
[39:56] 31
[40:06] proverbs 31 and verse
[40:10] 10 who can find a virtuous woman for her
[40:14] price is far above
[40:17] rubies Lord Jesus we come into your
[40:20] presence this evening Lord and Lord I
[40:23] pray that you would just Lord take
[40:26] control Lord you you see the the
[40:29] thoughts that I've been going over lord
[40:31] the a few scriptures and and quotes that
[40:34] I've put together but Lord I want you to
[40:37] be the one to to take control in the
[40:39] service Lord to to minister what needs
[40:42] to be said Lord may you just Lord use my
[40:45] lips use my voice Lord may I only say
[40:48] what you would want me to say Lord may
[40:49] you hold me back from saying anything
[40:51] that I shouldn't Lord and Lord may it
[40:53] just be something that would Minister to
[40:54] the hearts and the needs of your people
[40:56] Lord Lord we thank you
[40:59] for being here Lord we thank you for
[41:01] your presence Lord and we just commit
[41:03] the remainder of this service into your
[41:05] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:06] Christ we pray amen you may all have
[41:09] your
[41:11] seats that verse in Proverbs if you read
[41:14] from the Amplified version it says an
[41:18] excellent woman one who spiritual
[41:22] capable intelligent and
[41:24] virtuous who is he who can find her
[41:28] her value is more precious than jewels
[41:30] and her worth is far above rubies or
[41:34] pearls now the ver word virtuous means
[41:38] having or showing high moral standards
[41:41] if you actually go back to uh the
[41:44] archaic use for it it's also uh was
[41:47] normally used to uh be understood as
[41:49] someone that was
[41:51] chased now brother brandom says in the
[41:54] sermon Blas Blasphemous names he says I
[41:57] believe there is a bride that's
[41:58] predestinated I believe God said he
[42:00] would have a church without spot or
[42:02] wrinkle I believe in predestination that
[42:05] the bride is predestinated she's got to
[42:07] be there I hope I'm with her that see
[42:09] I'm with her now it's up to me to work
[42:11] out my own salvation with God until
[42:13] these things are approved of God and
[42:14] then sealed into the kingdom of God
[42:16] there is the holy spirit there is the
[42:18] genuine works of God it's sealed until
[42:20] the day of
[42:21] redemption and we know that brother
[42:24] brandham taught that the bride comes out
[42:27] of the church the bride is the called
[42:29] The Chosen the elect for the end time
[42:32] and so when you look at scriptures that
[42:34] are talking about uh about a virtuous
[42:38] woman talking about a woman of of
[42:40] quality woman of high moral character
[42:43] you can take those and we can apply them
[42:45] to our sisters and we can go into
[42:47] teaching about this is what it means to
[42:49] be a Godly woman but that's so those
[42:51] same things will apply to the bride of
[42:53] Christ those same lessons that you would
[42:55] take that you would hold on as this is
[42:57] what it means to be a Godly woman is
[43:00] also going to be very much the same
[43:02] lessons that would apply to what it
[43:04] means to be part of the Bride what it
[43:05] means to be part of the bride of
[43:08] Christ and
[43:10] so let's turn to Luke chapter
[43:24] 15 Luke chapter 15
[43:29] and we're going to start at verse
[43:33] eight says either what woman having 10
[43:36] pieces of silver if she lose one piece
[43:39] doth not light a candle and sweep the
[43:41] house and seek diligently till she find
[43:43] it and when she ha found it she calleth
[43:46] her friends and her neighbors together
[43:47] saying Rejoice with me for I found the
[43:50] peace which I had lost likewise I say
[43:53] unto you there is joy in the presence of
[43:55] the angels of God over one sinner that
[43:59] repenteth now in the sermon the second
[44:02] coming of the Lord that was preached in
[44:05] 57 brother brandom says Jesus Christ
[44:08] God's son likened this he said to a
[44:11] woman in our subject tonight we find
[44:13] this woman her husband is gone and she
[44:15] lost one of the coins out of her tablet
[44:18] now I'll try to explain that today if a
[44:20] woman is a married she would wear a
[44:21] wedding ring as a sign that she's
[44:23] married that's to keep other men from
[44:25] having anything to do with her they look
[44:27] and they see she's a married woman in
[44:29] those days they didn't have wedding
[44:31] rings they had a tablet they called it a
[44:33] tablet they put on their head it had 10
[44:35] coins and it went around their head and
[44:38] that was a sign they were a married
[44:39] woman and no man was to fool with them
[44:41] no boys to flirt with them they were
[44:43] married each one of those coins if we
[44:45] only have time I could tell you what
[44:48] each one of those coins meant it was
[44:50] placed in there and each coin meant a
[44:51] certain virtue of that woman the first
[44:54] meaning her love to her husband the
[44:55] second her pledge of virtue to live
[44:57] clean for him and the third and fourth
[44:59] and fifth on to the 9th and 10th if if
[45:01] you want to look it up look in Galatians
[45:02] 5 you'll find out that the woman
[45:04] represented the church and the church is
[45:06] an espouse wife to Christ and the tablet
[45:09] the church is supposed to wear is found
[45:10] in Galatians 5 which is love joy peace
[45:13] longsuffering goodness meekness
[45:15] gentleness patience that is the tablet
[45:17] that's supposed to be worn in the church
[45:19] Brotherly Love kindness
[45:22] Fellowship now as I was looking and and
[45:26] researching in into this a little bit I
[45:28] found that they say that normally these
[45:31] pieces would be approximately the size
[45:33] of a quarter in most cases uh each coin
[45:38] would have the the coat of arms or the
[45:41] symbol of the husband's family if the
[45:45] husband had come from a family that was
[45:48] known to be Shepherds then maybe there
[45:50] would be a a a sheep that was stamped
[45:52] onto it or if they were a family that uh
[45:55] they grew olives and maybe there would
[45:57] be an olive tree or something on it or
[45:59] if they grew grapes or they did this or
[46:01] they did that there would be some type
[46:02] of symbol on there that signified this
[46:05] was part of the
[46:07] family there were then those that would
[46:09] say that uh you know that they they
[46:12] would actually have on their on the
[46:14] other side they would sometimes stamp
[46:16] the year that the coin had been
[46:19] made and they
[46:22] were they were not normally known as
[46:26] them El being of immense value the coin
[46:30] itself was not something that you would
[46:33] normally take in and hey this is what
[46:35] it's going to be a huge amount of money
[46:36] I can take it down to the pawn shop and
[46:38] get a lot for it but it had a powerful
[46:41] representation to it it was something
[46:44] that it was one of
[46:50] the women of this time period were a lot
[46:53] of times given many jewels and Jewelry
[46:56] by their husbands it was a common gift
[46:58] that they were getting and because of
[47:01] the laws of that time the jewelry that
[47:04] she was given was completely her
[47:06] property even if they were to get
[47:08] divorced all of the jewelry that she had
[47:10] received was her property to take with
[47:14] her
[47:15] except for
[47:18] this this if her husband were to die if
[47:23] they were to be divorced it had to be
[47:25] returned back to the husband's family
[47:26] family because this was everything that
[47:28] went through that Heritage and it was
[47:32] also everything that was represented in
[47:35] what was expected of this woman these
[47:37] were the type of things that they were
[47:39] not worn commonly this was not something
[47:41] that she would wear because they got
[47:44] invited to dinner at The Neighbors this
[47:46] is not something that she would wear as
[47:49] she's around the house cleaning this is
[47:50] not something that she would wear for
[47:52] just any type of occasion this was
[47:55] something that she would only bring out
[47:57] in the most special times for the most
[48:00] special events that she would take this
[48:03] out because it was also representative
[48:05] that if she were caught in some type of
[48:08] trouble if she were caught doing
[48:10] something that she wasn't supposed to
[48:11] while her husband was away she could be
[48:14] taken down to the priest and the priest
[48:16] would take away the coin that
[48:19] represented the flaw that she had so if
[48:23] we had this is the coin that represents
[48:25] her love for her husband she's been
[48:28] found in the arms of another man I'm
[48:29] going to take that coin away so when the
[48:30] husband came back first off he knew
[48:33] exactly what type of betrayal had
[48:35] happened without anyone even telling him
[48:38] simply because the coin was
[48:41] gone all that was left was these nine
[48:45] instead of the 10 or these eight instead
[48:47] of the 10 or whatever it might be and so
[48:50] this had a lot of symbolic value and so
[48:54] when we look at it from the Western
[48:56] perspective of the idea of she lost a
[48:58] silver
[48:59] coin okay why did she then throw a
[49:03] party when she found it she invited all
[49:06] the neighbors because this was a big
[49:08] deal and even the neighbors would be
[49:10] like oh no she's going to be a shamed
[49:12] woman if she can't find this if she
[49:15] can't find the coin that she's supposed
[49:17] to have if she can't find what's
[49:18] supposed to be in her tablet in her
[49:21] headdress in whatever term you want to
[49:23] use for it it's not going to be there
[49:27] and her husband will have every right to
[49:30] put her out and in fact in the what I
[49:32] the different articles that I was
[49:33] reading about it it said he wouldn't
[49:36] divorce her but he would basically
[49:39] banish her from the house until the coin
[49:41] was
[49:43] found she would not be allowed to live
[49:46] in the
[49:47] home until the coin was found to bring
[49:52] back if she lost it now if it had been
[49:55] taken because
[49:57] she went to the priest and they took it
[49:58] away because of her doing something that
[49:59] could lead to divorcement but if she
[50:01] just lost in the house he had ever right
[50:02] to throw her out of the house until she
[50:04] found it to come
[50:06] back this was not something that was
[50:08] taken lightly in this and while these
[50:11] coins may not have been the most
[50:13] valuable jewelry she possessed they may
[50:15] not have been uh the most expensive item
[50:17] that she owned in most in really every
[50:21] other way they were the most precious
[50:23] thing that she had another place that I
[50:26] about it it said that this was something
[50:28] that she would have even before the
[50:31] wedding that would be in her
[50:33] possession and anytime that she was
[50:37] thinking
[50:38] about her betro anytime she was thinking
[50:41] about him they would take them out and
[50:43] they would begin to to rub them and
[50:45] polish them and so at the wedding how
[50:50] shiny they were was a direct reflection
[50:52] of how much she loved her
[50:55] husband
[50:57] the more she had thought about him the
[50:58] more that she had been thinking about
[51:00] him before the day of the actual
[51:01] ceremony the more time she would have
[51:04] spent polishing and cleaning them where
[51:06] if she showed up on that day and they
[51:08] were kind of dull and dingy it was
[51:09] immediately an indication that she
[51:11] didn't actually care for the husband
[51:13] that
[51:16] much there's a lot of ways we can go
[51:19] into
[51:20] this but as we're looking at it and
[51:23] brother brandom talks about this being a
[51:25] type of the fruit of the Spirit our love
[51:28] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[51:30] goodness Faith meekness
[51:34] Temperance we could bring that up be
[51:36] like so how often are we pulling those
[51:38] out and polishing them how often are we
[51:40] making sure that we're displaying all
[51:42] those things so that when we would step
[51:45] into the ceremony are they going to be
[51:48] as shiny as they should be are we going
[51:51] to have wiped off all the dust are we
[51:52] going to have made sure that they were
[51:54] in use the way that they're supposed to
[51:59] be let's turn to Revelations chap
[52:10] 21 Revelations chapter
[52:13] 21 and verse
[52:16] two and I John saw the holy city New
[52:20] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[52:23] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[52:25] her husband and I heard a great voice
[52:27] out of Heaven saying behold the
[52:29] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[52:31] will dwell with them and they shall be
[52:33] his people and God himself shall be with
[52:35] them and be their god let's drop down to
[52:37] verse N9 and there came unto me one of
[52:40] the Seven Angels which had the seven
[52:41] vials full of the seven last plagues and
[52:43] talked with me saying come hither I will
[52:45] show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and
[52:48] he carried me away in the spirit to a
[52:49] great and high mountain and showed me
[52:51] that great City the holy Jerusalem
[52:54] descending Out of Heaven from God having
[52:56] the glory of God and her light was like
[52:58] unto a stone most precious even a jasper
[53:01] stone clear as
[53:04] Crystal when we look at that in verse
[53:06] two it says it was prepared as a bride
[53:09] adorned for her husband now obviously we
[53:12] think about the all the the garments
[53:14] that go with it going you know from our
[53:16] western side going it has the the
[53:18] wedding dress just right and everything
[53:19] fixed up but yet at the same time when
[53:22] we tie that back into the tablet that we
[53:24] talked about earlier
[53:27] she has on display all of the coins that
[53:30] she's supposed to have as she's dressed
[53:32] as the bride adorned for her husband
[53:34] this would have been one of the things
[53:35] that she would have worn to the
[53:38] wedding that's one of those important
[53:41] events that she would have worn it for
[53:43] you know maybe she would have worn it
[53:44] then for 25th anniversary or 50th
[53:46] Anniversary those kind of
[53:48] things but she has those coins on
[53:51] display she has those fruits of the
[53:53] spirit on display to all for all to see
[53:57] see this is not something that's that's
[53:59] hidden away this is not something that
[54:05] uh is just in her
[54:08] pocket this isn't the uh the something
[54:11] old that the bride carry is hidden away
[54:13] in her pocket you know so that way she
[54:15] has all the different what is it old new
[54:18] blue and whatever um yeah borrow there
[54:21] we go um this isn't okay I've got to
[54:25] make sure I have all these different
[54:26] things like no this is proudly on
[54:28] display to make sure that everyone can
[54:30] see and these coins would while May
[54:33] might they might not have been the most
[54:35] expensive jewelry she owned they at the
[54:38] same time were also a
[54:40] reflection of the wealth of her
[54:44] husband's family okay so they could be
[54:49] more
[54:50] precious they often weren't the most
[54:52] expensive item she owned but if she was
[54:55] marrying into the right family maybe
[54:58] they were the most precious thing she
[55:00] owned maybe they
[55:02] were and if you're going in and you're
[55:04] marrying the King of Kings they're
[55:07] probably the most precious thing that
[55:08] you have is if you have all of them on
[55:14] display brother brandham says in the
[55:16] sermon the choosing of a bride he says
[55:18] when God gave man a wife he gave him the
[55:20] best thing he could give him outside of
[55:23] salvation but when one goes to trying to
[55:26] to take a man's place that's when she's
[55:27] about the worst thing he could get a
[55:29] hold
[55:30] of in recognizing your day and his
[55:33] message brother brandom says and
[55:35] remember the vision of last week that
[55:37] when the bride came to the preview of it
[55:40] there came up that little bride lovely
[55:42] in the vision and I not thinking about
[55:45] it just sitting there watching outside
[55:46] and there Comes the Bride I Heard a
[55:48] Voice by the side of me said here is the
[55:50] preview of the bride and she came by I
[55:52] noticed her the way she was a very
[55:54] lovely pretty young she was walking just
[55:56] as step as she could not a March just in
[55:58] the stride of a woman how they walk
[56:00] gracefully ladylike that's the way she
[56:02] was walking coming to my left on this
[56:04] side and she went out of my
[56:07] sight in the sermon recognizing your day
[56:10] and its message he says did you notice
[56:13] the fall of the world begin with the
[56:15] immorality of a woman did you know it's
[56:17] to the end the same way the immorality
[56:19] of the woman and the church represents
[56:22] is by a woman the church is a woman
[56:25] spiritually speaking
[56:26] so is the bride a woman spiritually
[56:28] speaking the immorality of the church
[56:30] how it's done look at the Visions look
[56:32] at the things see the Visions even that
[56:34] God gives and the vision is true I have
[56:36] my Bible over my heart to you people on
[56:38] tape the audience can see it I saw that
[56:40] God Almighty knows the truth never known
[56:42] it till just now there she is naked and
[56:45] don't know it she was just having her
[56:46] great time there you there you are but
[56:48] when the little Bride come in view it
[56:50] was
[56:52] different and in The Invisible Union of
[56:55] the bride of Christ
[56:57] he says what a sacred trust what
[56:59] responsibility to a woman now see why
[57:02] she's a type of the church which has the
[57:04] same responsibility as a woman has a
[57:06] sacred responsibility to her motherhood
[57:09] to her virtues to her husband the church
[57:11] has a sacred responsibility to the
[57:13] prayer and to the word and to Christ
[57:16] just the same as the woman has dropping
[57:19] a little bit further down in that same
[57:20] sermon he says she's a type she has the
[57:23] same precious virtues by Spirit give
[57:26] given to her to preserve the spirit and
[57:28] the word and never commit adultery with
[57:30] anything of the world or anything stay
[57:32] virgin to the word as a woman is to stay
[57:35] virtuous to her husband it's a sacred
[57:38] trust to honor her Lord's word above
[57:41] every man-made Creed wisdom denomination
[57:44] there is the church has given that
[57:49] trust now Proverbs it said who can find
[57:51] a virtuous woman for her price is far
[57:54] above
[57:55] rubies
[57:56] saying very clearly that this is
[57:59] something that's rare this is something
[58:01] that's valuable this is not something
[58:02] that is found just everywhere they're
[58:05] not found just laying on the sidewalk as
[58:08] you're going around around this is
[58:10] something that you have to to search for
[58:13] because of its
[58:14] Rarity if you go to Proverbs chap 20:
[58:19] 6-7 it says most men will Proclaim
[58:22] everyone his own goodness but a faithful
[58:25] man who can
[58:26] find the just man walketh in his
[58:29] Integrity his children are blessed after
[58:32] him and so the same thing is brought up
[58:35] in Proverbs referencing the man so this
[58:38] isn't just singling out the woman but
[58:40] going a faithful man who can
[58:43] find they didn't describe it with gems
[58:46] and everything but just still asking the
[58:47] same question who can find this this is
[58:50] this is a rarity this is not something
[58:51] that you that you find everywhere this
[58:54] is something that
[58:57] is special when it comes out this is
[58:59] something that stands out as being
[59:01] something that's important because it's
[59:07] different now let's go back to Proverbs
[59:09] chapter 31 we're going to start at verse
[59:12] 10 and just read down for a ways
[59:17] here Proverbs chapter 31 and and verse
[59:22] 10 who can find a virtuous woman for her
[59:25] price is far above rubies the heart of
[59:28] her husband doth safely trust in her so
[59:30] that he shall have no need of spoil she
[59:33] will do him good and not evil all the
[59:35] days of her life she seeketh wool and
[59:39] flax and worketh willingly with her
[59:41] hands she is like the merchant ship she
[59:43] bringeth her food from afar she riseth
[59:47] also while it is yet night and giveth
[59:49] meat to her household and a portion to
[59:51] her maidens she
[59:53] considerthe it with the fruit of her
[59:55] hand she planteth a Vineyard she girth
[59:58] her loins with strength and
[59:59] strengtheneth her arms she perceiveth
[1:00:02] that her merchandise is good her candle
[1:00:05] goeth not out by night she layeth her
[1:00:08] hands to the spindle and her hands hold
[1:00:10] the
[1:00:11] distaff she stretcheth out her hand to
[1:00:13] the poor yay she reacheth forth her
[1:00:16] hands to the
[1:00:17] needy she is not afraid of the snow for
[1:00:20] her household for all her household are
[1:00:22] clothed with
[1:00:24] Scarlet she maketh herself coverings of
[1:00:26] tapestry her clothing is silk and purple
[1:00:30] her husband is known in the gates when
[1:00:32] he sth among the Elders of the land she
[1:00:35] maketh fine linen and selleth it and
[1:00:37] delivereth girdles unto the merchant
[1:00:39] strength and honor are her clothing and
[1:00:41] she shall rejoice in time to come she
[1:00:44] open her mouth with wisdom and in her
[1:00:46] tongue is the law of kindness she lookth
[1:00:49] well to the ways of her household and
[1:00:51] eateth not the bread of idleness her
[1:00:53] children arise up and call her blessed
[1:00:56] her husband also and he praiseth her
[1:00:59] many daughters have done virtuously but
[1:01:01] thou excellest them all favor is
[1:01:04] deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman
[1:01:06] that fearth the Lord she shall be
[1:01:08] praised give her of the fruit of her
[1:01:10] hands and let her own works praise her
[1:01:12] in the
[1:01:15] gates now this has become a pretty
[1:01:17] common scripture for people to reference
[1:01:20] there
[1:01:22] are far more commentaries on this than I
[1:01:25] could would ever begin to count or talk
[1:01:28] about there are so many that are written
[1:01:31] to women on this is how to be the
[1:01:34] Proverbs 31 Woman this is what you
[1:01:39] do yeah there's more than we can talk
[1:01:41] about with it because it's there for
[1:01:43] everything and just in a little bit of
[1:01:46] looking because I was curious almost
[1:01:49] everyone that I found said now don't be
[1:01:52] afraid this probably seems like such a
[1:01:54] high bar to set that you're going to
[1:01:56] start off feeling like you're a
[1:01:58] failure not quite in those words but
[1:02:00] that's pretty much how most of them
[1:02:01] start off it's like you're going to read
[1:02:03] through this and
[1:02:05] go wow I don't fit
[1:02:11] that I have zero interest in preaching
[1:02:15] at the sisters we're sticking to the
[1:02:17] type of the Bride
[1:02:22] here thank
[1:02:24] you
[1:02:26] but as we go through this so as the
[1:02:28] start we've already talked about you
[1:02:29] know who can find a virtuous woman for
[1:02:31] her price is far above rubies this is
[1:02:34] someone that is rare there's a value
[1:02:37] here there's a a quality to it that's
[1:02:39] not to be
[1:02:40] expected verses 11 and 12 talk about how
[1:02:44] she is so trustworthy the heart of her
[1:02:47] husband doth safely trust in her so that
[1:02:49] he shall have no need of spoil she will
[1:02:52] do him good and not evil all the days of
[1:02:55] her life
[1:02:58] I had
[1:02:59] to dive into a little bit to try to get
[1:03:01] the idea of what it meant when it said
[1:03:04] so he'll have no need of spoil she's TR
[1:03:07] trustworthy he's going to have no need
[1:03:09] of
[1:03:10] spoil what is that even
[1:03:12] mean sometimes the old English doesn't
[1:03:15] translate quite so well basically it's
[1:03:18] the idea of spoil is what you would get
[1:03:21] when you win a battle when you go to
[1:03:23] take something and basically what they
[1:03:25] saying is she's able to provide
[1:03:28] everything that he has need of he has no
[1:03:30] need to go to some other source he has
[1:03:32] no need to go somewhere else this is the
[1:03:36] woman that he can fully trust this is
[1:03:38] the woman that he uh that is there to
[1:03:41] fully help him to fully take care of him
[1:03:43] to fully support him he has no need to
[1:03:45] look for anything else and yes you can
[1:03:49] look at that in the physical side but
[1:03:50] then you also look as the bride of
[1:03:53] Christ
[1:03:54] is the part partner that God created
[1:03:58] that God is calling us to be he's not
[1:03:59] going oh well I need to get this from
[1:04:02] that church and I need to get this from
[1:04:04] that church and this from that church
[1:04:06] it's no this is my
[1:04:09] bride this is where I'm have everything
[1:04:12] that I need this is where I'm going to
[1:04:13] get all the worship that I need all the
[1:04:15] Adoration that I need all the fellowship
[1:04:18] that I need comes from My bride I don't
[1:04:21] have to get it from this place or that
[1:04:23] place I get everything from from My
[1:04:29] bride this bride is is trustworthy she
[1:04:32] is
[1:04:32] faithful Luke 16:10 says he that is
[1:04:36] faithful in that which is least is
[1:04:37] faithful also in much and he that is
[1:04:40] unjust in the least is unjust also in
[1:04:43] much Revelations 17 and verse1
[1:04:48] 14 says these shall make war with the
[1:04:51] lamb and the lamb shall overcome them
[1:04:52] for he is Lord of lords and king of
[1:04:54] kings and they that are with him are
[1:04:56] called and chosen and
[1:05:01] faithful as we continue down this
[1:05:04] proverbs
[1:05:06] 31 we go into verse 13 she seeketh wool
[1:05:11] and flax and worketh willingly with her
[1:05:13] hands she is like the merchant ship she
[1:05:16] bringeth her food from
[1:05:18] afar
[1:05:20] this this bride is industrious she's
[1:05:24] hardworking she's not not lazy she's not
[1:05:27] just laying around
[1:05:30] and saying God you do every single thing
[1:05:34] I'm going to lay here and eat grapes and
[1:05:36] watch soap
[1:05:37] operas cuz you can handle
[1:05:41] everything she's a
[1:05:43] worker now she's still trusting her
[1:05:46] husband to
[1:05:47] provide but she's faithful she's
[1:05:50] industrious she's
[1:05:52] hardworking verse 15 it says she riseth
[1:05:55] also while it is yet
[1:05:57] night she gets up before the sun gets
[1:06:02] up I'm going to look at my kids for a
[1:06:04] minute they get up
[1:06:07] early and giveth meat to her household
[1:06:09] and a portion to her
[1:06:11] maidens she consider a field and buyeth
[1:06:14] it with the fruit of her hands she
[1:06:15] planteth a Vineyard she girth her loins
[1:06:18] with strength and strengthen her arms
[1:06:20] she perceiveth that her merchandise is
[1:06:23] good her candle goeth not out by
[1:06:27] night she riseth early while it's yet
[1:06:31] night and then during the night she
[1:06:34] stays up because otherwise why would you
[1:06:36] leave the candle lit so she's still up
[1:06:39] working she's not lazy in any sense of
[1:06:44] the
[1:06:46] word she layeth her hands to the spindle
[1:06:48] and her hands hold the dis
[1:06:51] staff in Philippians 2: 14-15 it says
[1:06:55] says do all things without murmuring and
[1:06:58] disputing that you may be blameless and
[1:07:00] harmless the sons of God without rebuke
[1:07:03] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[1:07:04] Nation among whom ye shine as lights in
[1:07:07] the
[1:07:07] world Galatians 6 and9 says and let us
[1:07:10] not be weary and well doing for in due
[1:07:12] season we shall reap if we faint
[1:07:16] not God calls his his
[1:07:20] bride to be working he calls us to be
[1:07:24] active he calls calls us to be doing
[1:07:27] different
[1:07:28] things he's
[1:07:30] not calling a woman that would fall into
[1:07:33] the old Greek lifestyle where the women
[1:07:36] just sat around the house and had all
[1:07:38] the servants to do everything and didn't
[1:07:42] necessarily have to do a whole
[1:07:44] lot God's going no I want a woman that
[1:07:47] is truly my helpmate that is right there
[1:07:50] beside me working that is doing the
[1:07:52] different things that is trying
[1:07:54] to take care of the fields and take care
[1:07:58] of the house and take care of the
[1:08:00] children and take care of whatever we
[1:08:04] want to talk
[1:08:05] about I'm looking for a bride and once
[1:08:09] again very clear I'm not pointing at
[1:08:12] sisters sisters can take it yes but this
[1:08:15] is for all the brothers because we're
[1:08:16] all part of the Bride here and God's
[1:08:18] calling all of us to be working to be
[1:08:20] industrious he's calling us to be
[1:08:23] working in the fields for him
[1:08:29] amen verse 20 she stretcheth out her
[1:08:31] hand to the poor yay she reacheth forth
[1:08:34] her hands to the
[1:08:36] needy his bride is caring she's loving
[1:08:39] she cares about those around her John
[1:08:44] 13:34 it says a new commandment I give
[1:08:46] unto you that you love one another as I
[1:08:50] have loved you that ye also love one
[1:08:52] another by this shall all men know that
[1:08:54] ye are my my disciples if you have love
[1:08:57] one to
[1:09:02] another back to verse 21 it says she is
[1:09:05] not afraid of the snow for her household
[1:09:08] for all her household are clothed with
[1:09:12] Scarlet She's Not Afraid of the cold
[1:09:14] she's made sure that the household is
[1:09:16] well clothed that they have everything
[1:09:18] they need to stand against the
[1:09:21] elements nowadays great the kids all
[1:09:24] have good winter jackets we're set you
[1:09:26] know we've got uh there's we've got good
[1:09:29] Heat Going we've got all these different
[1:09:30] things the family's taken care of the
[1:09:34] children are secure the family is secure
[1:09:37] she maketh herself coverings of tapestry
[1:09:39] her clothing is silk and
[1:09:42] purple they're focusing on the idea of
[1:09:45] the the silk and purple because this is
[1:09:47] showing that she's able to get the
[1:09:49] quality she's able to get it's not
[1:09:52] because we're wanting to be out there in
[1:09:54] super bright colors all the
[1:09:56] time but she's going for the quality and
[1:09:59] taking care of her family she's making
[1:10:01] sure that everything is
[1:10:03] there so as the bride when
[1:10:06] we're looking at our brothers and
[1:10:08] sisters are we helping to take care of
[1:10:10] them the way that we should are we
[1:10:12] helping to care for those around us to
[1:10:14] show that
[1:10:16] love are we doing our
[1:10:19] part looking around
[1:10:24] us
[1:10:27] verse 23 her husband is known in the
[1:10:29] gates when he sth among the Elders of
[1:10:32] the
[1:10:33] land you know it's interesting to me in
[1:10:36] all this listing here it talks about her
[1:10:40] husband but it doesn't actually talk
[1:10:42] about what the husband
[1:10:45] does and so a lot of this what I get
[1:10:47] from it is the idea that the husband's
[1:10:52] reputation is only increased or improve
[1:10:55] d by his
[1:11:00] bride they look at the bride and they
[1:11:03] think better of the husband because of
[1:11:05] the quality that is is that is in the
[1:11:08] bride because of what they've seen
[1:11:10] because of how they've seen her work
[1:11:12] because of how they've seen her act
[1:11:14] because of how they've seen her handle
[1:11:16] different things they immediately have a
[1:11:18] higher opinion of the husband before
[1:11:21] they even meet
[1:11:22] him before they've even before they even
[1:11:25] really know him just from the bride they
[1:11:28] have a better thought of what kind of
[1:11:30] character the husband has because he
[1:11:33] chose the bride and so if he chose a
[1:11:36] bride of this character then that means
[1:11:37] that his character must also be at a
[1:11:40] certain
[1:11:44] level the sociologist Rodney Stark noted
[1:11:47] in his book the rise of
[1:11:49] Christianity that Christian Courage in
[1:11:51] the face of death particularly caught
[1:11:54] the attention of the pagans Christians
[1:11:56] were not only willing to die for their
[1:11:58] faith through persecution but they also
[1:12:01] accepted the risk of disease to care for
[1:12:03] the sick even when they had been
[1:12:05] abandoned by their families they cared
[1:12:07] for the poor Christian and Pagan alike
[1:12:10] and they treated women children and
[1:12:13] slaves with great dignity including
[1:12:16] recovering abandoned
[1:12:18] newborns I found this when I was just
[1:12:20] researching the testimony of that first
[1:12:23] church as they were going going out and
[1:12:25] they're going into this Roman world and
[1:12:28] what was it that would stand out I know
[1:12:31] that in sermons before I've talked about
[1:12:34] what it meant to go the Second Mile this
[1:12:37] was actually something that the
[1:12:38] Christian Church would do there was
[1:12:40] Roman law that a Roman soldier could
[1:12:43] compel somebody to carry their pack for
[1:12:46] one
[1:12:47] mile the law allowed one mile at the end
[1:12:51] of one mile you could set the pack down
[1:12:53] and walk away you didn't have to keep
[1:12:55] going but yet the Christians of the time
[1:12:58] would purposely go no I'm now going to
[1:13:00] go a second mile because now it's I'm no
[1:13:03] longer being compelled it's now I'm no
[1:13:05] longer doing it because the law told me
[1:13:07] to do I'm now doing it of my free will
[1:13:11] I'm now choosing to serve
[1:13:14] you my enemy the person
[1:13:18] that hates me I'm choosing to go another
[1:13:23] mile continue to carry your pack for you
[1:13:25] to continue to carry your
[1:13:28] equipment and it's by these types of
[1:13:31] things that we see in our lives and our
[1:13:34] witness that so many would be converted
[1:13:37] to
[1:13:38] Christ it was because of how they saw
[1:13:41] the bride acting it was because of how
[1:13:44] they saw the chosen
[1:13:47] acting and it's the same thing today
[1:13:51] most people aren't converted simply
[1:13:52] because they sat down somewhere and
[1:13:55] decided to read the
[1:13:56] Bible you know they're at a hotel room
[1:13:59] they found that whoever Gideon Bible in
[1:14:02] the in the night stand they decided to
[1:14:03] read it and went oh man I should accept
[1:14:06] Christ that I'm sure that happens
[1:14:08] occasionally but that's not the common
[1:14:10] way normally it's because they've seen
[1:14:12] someone's
[1:14:14] life they've seen the way you act
[1:14:18] they've seen the way you act on the job
[1:14:19] site they've seen the way that you act
[1:14:21] as you go through trials as you go
[1:14:23] through struggles as you go through
[1:14:24] problems
[1:14:26] and they realize that because of the
[1:14:28] quality of the Bride they would really
[1:14:30] like to get to know the
[1:14:32] groom because of the quality of the
[1:14:35] Bride they can see that there's now
[1:14:37] something about the groom that they want
[1:14:39] to know
[1:14:41] about they may have never met the groom
[1:14:43] before they may have never known
[1:14:45] anything about him but because of the
[1:14:47] quality of the Bride because of the
[1:14:49] character that is there the reputation
[1:14:52] of the groom is now increased the
[1:14:55] reputation of the groom at least in
[1:14:57] their eyes we all know our Lord is the
[1:15:01] king of kings Lord of lords his
[1:15:02] reputation can't go any higher but in
[1:15:05] their eyes in that person's eyes they
[1:15:08] didn't necessarily see them see our Lord
[1:15:11] as king of kings and Lord of lords but
[1:15:14] because of your life because of how
[1:15:17] you've acted because of how you've
[1:15:19] handled different things because of how
[1:15:21] you've
[1:15:23] lived they look and go their something
[1:15:26] different there's something about this
[1:15:29] that is now
[1:15:31] elevating the groom in their
[1:15:34] eyes and to me that's the piece that you
[1:15:37] see here as you go her husband is known
[1:15:39] in the gate I don't know what her
[1:15:40] husband does I don't know anything about
[1:15:43] his history you don't know anything
[1:15:45] about what family he came from you don't
[1:15:47] know anything about him but yet because
[1:15:50] of the character of his wife it's
[1:15:52] immediately assumed and held up that the
[1:15:54] character
[1:15:56] of her husband has to be at this
[1:16:01] level for this character for the
[1:16:04] Character level of this woman her
[1:16:07] husband must be a judge in the gate he
[1:16:09] must be one of the elders he must be one
[1:16:11] of the respected one of the valued one
[1:16:14] of
[1:16:16] the top
[1:16:18] tier and all of that's being found
[1:16:21] simply because they're looking at the
[1:16:23] bride and going this is is her
[1:16:26] quality well obviously her husband must
[1:16:29] be of this quality as
[1:16:36] well she maketh fine linen and sth it
[1:16:39] and delivereth girdles unto the
[1:16:42] merchant strength and honor are her
[1:16:44] clothing and she shall rejoice in time
[1:16:46] to
[1:16:47] come she openeth her mouth with wisdom
[1:16:50] and in her tongue is the law of
[1:16:53] kindness she lookth well to the ways of
[1:16:56] her household and eateth not the bread
[1:16:58] of
[1:17:00] idleness she gets up early she stays up
[1:17:03] late and she doesn't eat the bread of
[1:17:08] idleness like we already said she's a
[1:17:12] worker
[1:17:15] she's doing what needs to be
[1:17:21] done she's one that her husband can
[1:17:25] trust in her he can trust
[1:17:29] in from this obviously he can trust in
[1:17:32] the decisions she's
[1:17:35] making cuz she's going out and buying
[1:17:38] fields and buying Vineyards and doing
[1:17:41] these different
[1:17:44] things there's a quality there and the
[1:17:47] husband can have faith in her because he
[1:17:50] knows her quality he knows that her
[1:17:52] desires are the same as his desires
[1:17:55] the desires that he has for growing the
[1:17:58] family bettering the family doing these
[1:18:00] different things are those same desires
[1:18:01] within her she's working towards the
[1:18:04] same
[1:18:10] goals she's
[1:18:12] ultimately the Homemaker the mother the
[1:18:15] the helpmate to
[1:18:18] him and when we look at our relationship
[1:18:21] with Christ those are so many of the
[1:18:23] different things that we're called to in
[1:18:24] the simp
[1:18:27] way we're called to be showing his care
[1:18:31] and his love to the world around us
[1:18:33] we're called to be working in the world
[1:18:35] around us we're called to be ministering
[1:18:37] to those around us to helping take care
[1:18:39] of the family to help take care of
[1:18:42] what's going
[1:18:44] on and brother bham talked about the
[1:18:47] fact that having a bride to the point
[1:18:50] that when she speaks she's speaking his
[1:18:55] words she's speaking with the same
[1:18:58] Authority that he
[1:19:00] has and he can trust her with that
[1:19:02] Authority because she has the same Desir
[1:19:04] she's going for the same goal she has
[1:19:07] the same Target in mind as what the
[1:19:11] husband does she's going for the same
[1:19:14] the same thing she's not out going hey
[1:19:16] I'm going to grow my my own little world
[1:19:19] my own little whatever it's I'm working
[1:19:22] with my Lord to achieve this
[1:19:29] her children rise up and call her
[1:19:32] blessed her husband also and he praiseth
[1:19:43] her her husband also and he praiseth
[1:19:48] her that's the place that we're called
[1:19:50] to as the bride we should be living in
[1:19:52] such a way that
[1:19:55] it's so much like the story of
[1:19:58] Job where God can go to Satan and go hey
[1:20:03] have you seen my bride down on
[1:20:06] earth have you seen brother Michael and
[1:20:09] brother Donald the way that they're
[1:20:12] living have you seen the testimony that
[1:20:16] they have with everything you keep
[1:20:17] throwing at
[1:20:20] them that's still my
[1:20:22] bride and that's still the way that
[1:20:24] she's living that's still the way that
[1:20:25] she's standing as everything's coming
[1:20:27] against her as you're throwing
[1:20:30] everything you can as brother brandom
[1:20:32] said with every gun of Hell trained on
[1:20:36] us and yet God can still go there and
[1:20:40] praise her and go this is my bride this
[1:20:45] is the quality that I've chosen this is
[1:20:47] the one that I have chosen that I have
[1:20:49] selected to live this kind of life to
[1:20:53] live out in Satan's eaten to live out in
[1:20:56] the darkest
[1:20:58] age and
[1:21:00] yet her husband can still praise
[1:21:05] her can still praise her for the way
[1:21:09] she's living for the decision she's
[1:21:11] making for the action that she's
[1:21:18] taking this isn't some type of low
[1:21:21] calling this isn't some type of oh B you
[1:21:24] know we can hit this any time this is
[1:21:27] high
[1:21:29] level we are
[1:21:31] called to be so
[1:21:37] much and we're called to H move with
[1:21:41] that same heart same decision making
[1:21:45] that God has to go when this is what hey
[1:21:48] this is what I decide I'm going to do it
[1:21:51] should be because we know that's the
[1:21:53] kind of thing God would want us to do
[1:21:55] it's not about going hey this is what
[1:21:58] I'm going to do for my own pleasure for
[1:22:00] a few moments this is how I'm going to
[1:22:02] go enjoy my life for whatever
[1:22:07] season it's about
[1:22:09] no this is what my Lord would want me to
[1:22:12] do this is the kind of field he would
[1:22:16] want me to buy this is the kind of work
[1:22:18] he would want me to do this is the kind
[1:22:21] of people he would want me to be around
[1:22:24] this is the kind of testimony he would
[1:22:26] want me to
[1:22:33] have but a woman that fearth the Lord
[1:22:37] she shall be
[1:22:39] praised it ties in so well with her
[1:22:42] husband also and he praiseth her because
[1:22:44] a woman that fearth the Lord she shall
[1:22:47] be
[1:22:48] praised and the same thing we can switch
[1:22:51] it and a man that fearth the Lord he
[1:22:53] will be praised
[1:22:56] as part of the Bride this these aren't
[1:22:58] instructions that only go to the sisters
[1:23:01] that are in the crowd this isn't going
[1:23:04] hey the Proverbs 31 Woman This is for
[1:23:07] women only guys we can cut that chapter
[1:23:10] right out of the book we don't even have
[1:23:11] to read it it's not important to
[1:23:14] us no the type is still there we are
[1:23:18] still the bride of Christ in the
[1:23:21] spiritual side we still fall in the
[1:23:23] feminine and so we can still take these
[1:23:25] same verses and go hey I can learn some
[1:23:27] lessons from
[1:23:29] here and those lessons tie right in with
[1:23:31] all the rest of scripture so we're not
[1:23:32] looking at something new that we've
[1:23:34] never read anywhere else
[1:23:37] before Matthew chapter
[1:23:42] 22 verse
[1:23:45] 36 Master which is the great commandment
[1:23:48] in the
[1:23:49] law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love
[1:23:52] the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:23:55] with all thy soul with all thy mind this
[1:23:58] is the first and great commandment and
[1:24:00] the second is like unto it Thou shalt
[1:24:02] love thy neighbor as thyself on these
[1:24:05] two Commandments hang all the law and
[1:24:08] the
[1:24:11] prophets I was talking with my Sunday
[1:24:13] school class this morning as we were
[1:24:15] Beginning to Look At The Ten
[1:24:16] Commandments
[1:24:18] and when you take the Ten Commandments
[1:24:20] and start to look at
[1:24:22] them ultimately if you take these two
[1:24:24] Commandments it covers the others The
[1:24:27] Ten Commandments are more detailed but
[1:24:30] if I love the Lord God with all my heart
[1:24:33] with all my soul with all my mind I'm
[1:24:35] not going to have any other gods before
[1:24:37] him because I love him
[1:24:39] completely I'm not going to make any
[1:24:42] Idols because I love him completely I
[1:24:44] want to worship
[1:24:46] him I'm not going to do this I'm not
[1:24:49] going to do that because I love him
[1:24:53] completely and then you go into the
[1:24:55] verses of Thou shalt not steal Thou
[1:24:57] shalt not covet this that or the other
[1:24:59] well if I love my neighbor as
[1:25:02] myself then I'm not going to go take
[1:25:04] brother Donald's lawn
[1:25:07] mower CU I love brother Donald I don't
[1:25:10] want to take his lawn
[1:25:13] mower I'm not going to go take one of
[1:25:17] brother Williams fishing
[1:25:18] rods I know he likes to fish so I'm
[1:25:20] going to make sure he has his fishing
[1:25:23] rods I'm not going to go and do these
[1:25:26] different things I'm not going to sit
[1:25:29] there and go man I really wish I had
[1:25:30] brother Williams
[1:25:32] dog those those three cute puppies I man
[1:25:34] I wish I had one of those instead of my
[1:25:36] big old
[1:25:41] thing because we love our brothers and
[1:25:46] our sisters as
[1:25:48] ourselves if I love God with all my
[1:25:51] heart with all my mind if I love love my
[1:25:55] brothers and sisters as I love the rest
[1:25:58] of it suddenly gets real
[1:26:00] easy the law of Love covers so much of
[1:26:03] it real
[1:26:07] quick and so when a woman or a man fears
[1:26:12] the
[1:26:13] lord loves the Lord with all their heart
[1:26:17] with all their mind with all their
[1:26:22] soul they are going to be elevated to a
[1:26:25] certain place because the character if
[1:26:28] you love God then you know I should be
[1:26:31] up and
[1:26:32] working I should be up and doing these
[1:26:34] different things I should
[1:26:36] be not spending 12 hours in bed I should
[1:26:40] be up about my tasks I should be living
[1:26:44] my life a certain way I should be having
[1:26:46] a
[1:26:48] witness I should be making sure that
[1:26:50] when I'm on the job
[1:26:52] site that I'm carrying my myself in the
[1:26:54] right way that I'm not blowing my top at
[1:26:58] every single little thing that comes
[1:27:00] along that I'm not allowing myself to
[1:27:03] get caught up in the music that's being
[1:27:06] played by other Crews that are there or
[1:27:08] this that or the
[1:27:10] other hey I work at Chick-fil-A in the
[1:27:14] kitchen they've got their speaker where
[1:27:15] they have their music playing that is
[1:27:17] not the nice Christian music that we
[1:27:19] play out in the dining room for
[1:27:22] everybody that's not awful or anything
[1:27:24] we have very clear guidelines but it's
[1:27:27] not just the typical Christian music and
[1:27:29] so I can go back there and I can hear
[1:27:31] some of the old country music that I
[1:27:32] used to listen to coming through
[1:27:34] sometimes I can hear some different
[1:27:36] contemporary songs that I used to know
[1:27:38] or this that or the other as I'm walking
[1:27:41] back and
[1:27:42] forth being a Chick-fil-A doesn't make
[1:27:44] me immune to what the guys run into on
[1:27:46] the job site
[1:27:50] sometime but God calls us to live it a
[1:27:52] certain way God's calling us
[1:27:56] to to be living out A Life That's a
[1:28:00] testimony so when people look at us we
[1:28:04] are that salt we are that light that's
[1:28:06] attracting them that they're going hey I
[1:28:10] want what you have I want to know how
[1:28:14] you got what you've got I want to know
[1:28:17] what makes you different why do you act
[1:28:21] different for the Sisters why do you
[1:28:23] dress different
[1:28:27] we're called to be in a
[1:28:29] place where it's
[1:28:31] noticeable you know when you read
[1:28:33] through this description of the Proverbs
[1:28:35] 31
[1:28:37] Woman just reading through the
[1:28:39] description you know it's noticeable
[1:28:41] whoever was around her would
[1:28:44] know she's probably acting different
[1:28:47] than some of her
[1:28:48] neighbors if all her neighbors acted the
[1:28:50] same way that was a really good
[1:28:51] neighborhood that's where I want to live
[1:28:58] but she set an example she set a
[1:29:01] standard in the way that she was walking
[1:29:03] and the way that she was carrying
[1:29:05] herself and the things that she was
[1:29:08] doing and the way that her children
[1:29:11] treated her and respected her in the way
[1:29:14] that her husband treated her and
[1:29:16] respected her people could look at it
[1:29:18] and know okay there's something that's
[1:29:21] different
[1:29:23] here
[1:29:29] I mean ultimately this is the one where
[1:29:32] I'll jump into the marriage for just a
[1:29:34] minute husbands our wives are not
[1:29:37] doormats we don't get to command them
[1:29:39] around and do whatever we want it's not
[1:29:42] the way it works that's right because
[1:29:44] that's not the way that God treats us
[1:29:47] and he's our example as a husband yes
[1:29:49] sir the value that he places on us as
[1:29:52] the bride is the same kind of value that
[1:29:55] we should be placing on our
[1:29:58] Brides as we look at
[1:30:02] them people will look at our sisters and
[1:30:05] the way they dress the way most of them
[1:30:07] are stay-at-home moms and all these kind
[1:30:09] of different things and they'll go well
[1:30:11] you're not letting them do what they
[1:30:14] should do you're not letting them have
[1:30:15] the opportunity to go into the world and
[1:30:17] have jobs to do this that or the
[1:30:20] other we're
[1:30:22] going I don't know about for every
[1:30:24] sister here I know for my wife this is
[1:30:27] what she wants to do it's made my life
[1:30:29] real easy she wants to be at home taking
[1:30:32] care of the kid she wants when we first
[1:30:34] got married before we had kids I would
[1:30:37] have been fully okay if she had wanted
[1:30:39] to work when we first got married I mean
[1:30:41] it was an empty house she can only clean
[1:30:43] it so many
[1:30:44] times there's only two of us not not
[1:30:46] going to get that
[1:30:47] dirty but she didn't want to she was
[1:30:50] like I want to be at home I want to be a
[1:30:52] homemaker
[1:30:55] and obviously she wanted to have
[1:30:59] kids probably not quite as many but you
[1:31:03] know the Lord had
[1:31:04] plans but this was her this was her
[1:31:07] desire this was her desire when she got
[1:31:10] out of school I mean her first job was
[1:31:13] she worked at a daycare because she
[1:31:14] wanted to take care of children this is
[1:31:16] where her heart
[1:31:19] was and so in no way are any of us as
[1:31:23] husbands going hey we're going to stamp
[1:31:24] out our wives dreams and they're going
[1:31:26] to be our servants and they're going to
[1:31:27] do whatever
[1:31:29] it's no these
[1:31:31] are our rubies these are our Treasures
[1:31:35] yes
[1:31:36] sir this
[1:31:38] is our
[1:31:41] bride and when Christ looks at each one
[1:31:43] of us and goes that's my
[1:31:46] bride we're not living a life where hey
[1:31:50] I love the way that it's put is that
[1:31:53] I've heard different ones say it's like
[1:31:54] hey I go to the bar and I drink just as
[1:31:57] much as I want
[1:32:00] to I go and I use just as many illicit
[1:32:05] drugs as I want
[1:32:06] to God just took the want to
[1:32:09] away so I don't want
[1:32:13] to I'm not living a certain way because
[1:32:16] this is rules and
[1:32:18] regulations that okay I have to make
[1:32:20] sure I live within
[1:32:22] this
[1:32:24] we live that way
[1:32:26] because we know that it's what our Lord
[1:32:29] wants and we want to serve our Lord we
[1:32:33] want to be living for him we want to be
[1:32:37] at the point where the decisions we make
[1:32:39] immediately tie in with his guidelines
[1:32:44] we want it to be that my desires fit
[1:32:48] completely within his
[1:32:52] desires so so that I can be to the point
[1:32:55] where I can be
[1:32:58] trusted like brother brandom was with
[1:33:00] certain things or like had he right
[1:33:02] was to have that power of the spoken
[1:33:08] word God could give that to Hatty rright
[1:33:10] because he knew he could trust her with
[1:33:12] what she would ask brother Brandon we've
[1:33:15] read it through sermon after sermon that
[1:33:17] she could have asked for a million
[1:33:19] dollars she could have asked for this
[1:33:21] she could have asked for
[1:33:22] that
[1:33:24] and she would have gotten
[1:33:27] it because it had just been given to
[1:33:31] her but God knew that he could give that
[1:33:33] to her because her
[1:33:36] desire was
[1:33:38] correct and that she was going to Beed
[1:33:40] go I want their salvation that's more
[1:33:43] important than anything
[1:33:47] else how many of us could be in that
[1:33:49] exact same spot and God could go yes I
[1:33:52] absolutely know I can
[1:33:55] trust this brother this sister with that
[1:33:58] exact same
[1:34:02] thing there are days where I can
[1:34:04] definitely say God couldn't trust me
[1:34:06] with that I will
[1:34:13] admit I'm not I'm trying not to be
[1:34:15] gentle on myself either there are days
[1:34:18] where I know he couldn't trust me with
[1:34:19] that if he just went speak it and it'll
[1:34:22] happen it's not not going to be a good
[1:34:27] thing but we want to be at the point
[1:34:30] where God could trust us with
[1:34:33] that that God could go down and could go
[1:34:37] over and go brother
[1:34:39] John speak
[1:34:41] it and he would know that your desire
[1:34:44] and your heart are beating at the exact
[1:34:47] same place that his is and so what you
[1:34:50] speak is going to be what he
[1:34:52] wants be what he wants to have
[1:34:56] happen and each one of us that's the
[1:34:59] place that we're called to be we're
[1:35:00] called to
[1:35:02] be this
[1:35:04] bride that is living so close to God
[1:35:09] that is him living through
[1:35:11] US him speaking through US him
[1:35:15] taking control so that our desires are
[1:35:19] his
[1:35:20] desires and then yes he can
[1:35:24] hand
[1:35:25] over the credit card or checkbook or
[1:35:28] whichever one you want to call it and
[1:35:30] know that we're going to only be
[1:35:32] spending and claiming what he wants us
[1:35:38] to in the leoty in church
[1:35:41] age brother brandom says a good woman is
[1:35:44] a jewel in a man's Crown said the wisest
[1:35:46] man on earth a man ought to honor a good
[1:35:49] woman see but an evil one is water and
[1:35:51] his blood and his blood is his life
[1:35:54] you men that's got good wives you don't
[1:35:56] know how you ought to thank God for a
[1:35:57] good wife for if God could have given
[1:36:00] man anything better for a helpmate he'd
[1:36:01] have done it but a woman is the best
[1:36:04] helpmate that God could give a
[1:36:07] man in the second coming of the
[1:36:10] Lord he says could you imagine coming in
[1:36:12] at night time tired weary worn if you're
[1:36:15] a farmer mechanic
[1:36:19] preacher whatever you are come in when
[1:36:23] you go into your little home you're
[1:36:24] you're longing till you can get there
[1:36:26] you open the door and a sweet little
[1:36:28] wife stands there she greets you she's
[1:36:31] all pretty and cleaned up she walks over
[1:36:32] kisses you on the cheek and says Dad
[1:36:34] you're tired she sits you down in a
[1:36:36] chair she sets herself down on your lap
[1:36:39] she puts her arms around you and she
[1:36:40] Pats you it just seems like then that
[1:36:43] you're not tired something picks you up
[1:36:45] it's something that God gave you for
[1:36:46] that purpose it's a part of you now if
[1:36:48] she's a true
[1:36:52] wife
[1:36:54] in the sermon speak to the
[1:36:56] Rock brother brandom says oh I think of
[1:36:59] that I think of it in in Genesis when
[1:37:01] when God made the Sun and made the moon
[1:37:04] now the Moon is the wife of the sun now
[1:37:07] when the Sun goes away the Moon reflects
[1:37:08] the light of the sun is that right on
[1:37:10] the earth and now when Jesus was taken
[1:37:13] away we are the bride which is the Moon
[1:37:15] to reflect the light of the gospel and
[1:37:17] we can't reflect it until he Shines on
[1:37:19] us amen well when when the gospel goes
[1:37:22] to shining on us then we shine it out so
[1:37:25] send the light Lord is my prayer that we
[1:37:28] can reflect the light of the Son of God
[1:37:29] in his power and his resurrection and
[1:37:32] his
[1:37:32] fullness how
[1:37:38] marvelous and in questions and answers
[1:37:41] law having a
[1:37:44] shadow brother brandom says now and the
[1:37:46] moon and when the sun has gone down the
[1:37:48] moon
[1:37:49] shines you can call me it but I look to
[1:37:52] see something moov moving look in the
[1:37:54] creation all things typed and patterned
[1:37:57] some night I get to preaching I have a
[1:37:58] few nights of this I just feel like I
[1:37:59] could just move on and on and on see
[1:38:01] just to see how it begins to jump up in
[1:38:03] front of you you know when the Holy
[1:38:04] Spirit bringing and hanging up there for
[1:38:06] you to see all the things of Shadows and
[1:38:08] types when God made the heavens and
[1:38:11] earth he made the moon to shine in the
[1:38:12] absence of the sun to give light while
[1:38:14] the sun was gone see a beautiful type of
[1:38:17] Christ in the church the church is the
[1:38:19] Moon to give the light to the world
[1:38:21] while the sun is gone see what I mean a
[1:38:24] lesser light amen and then otherwise the
[1:38:26] moon and the sun is husband and wife as
[1:38:28] Christ in the church is husband and wife
[1:38:30] the wife being the weaking weaker vessel
[1:38:32] only giving a smaller light in the
[1:38:34] absence of her husband and the church
[1:38:36] can only make manifestations of the Holy
[1:38:38] Spirit remember the moon cannot give any
[1:38:41] light of her own and when you see the
[1:38:42] Moonlight it's not the Moonlight it's
[1:38:44] the reflection of the sunlight and
[1:38:46] Christ ascended up is that right and
[1:38:48] shineth his light on the church to
[1:38:50] reflect his light and power to the world
[1:38:52] in his absence
[1:38:54] see what I
[1:38:57] mean Revelations 22 and verse 17 says
[1:39:02] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:39:05] and let him that heareth say come and
[1:39:07] let him that is a thirst come and
[1:39:09] whosoever will let him take the Water of
[1:39:12] Life
[1:39:14] freely as the musicians
[1:39:22] come
[1:39:28] in the sermon it is the rising of the
[1:39:31] Sun and as he being the groom the bride
[1:39:34] has to come forth because it's part of
[1:39:36] him and it can only be the manifestation
[1:39:38] of the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:39:41] any others has spoke of the Bride it can
[1:39:43] only manifest if it does something
[1:39:46] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:39:48] bride because she is the Flesh of his
[1:39:50] flesh bone of his bone life of his life
[1:39:53] power power of his power she is him a
[1:39:56] man and a woman are one and woman taken
[1:39:59] from his side she had taken the spirit
[1:40:01] the feminist Spirit from him the flesh
[1:40:03] from his side made both mechanics and
[1:40:06] Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and
[1:40:08] the Flesh of him and put it together and
[1:40:10] made mechanics and Dynamics until the
[1:40:12] church or the
[1:40:14] people all these Easter bunnies and
[1:40:16] ceremonies and big churches and finery
[1:40:18] will fail and pass
[1:40:20] away until that church becomes both
[1:40:23] Dynam Dynamics and mechanics and the
[1:40:24] spirit of God that moved him to do the
[1:40:26] things that he did if he hid on 16
[1:40:29] cylinders so will the bride amen for he
[1:40:32] said in John 14:12 he that believeth on
[1:40:35] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:40:37] I'll give him charge of my damic of my
[1:40:40] Dynamics in his mechanics that the world
[1:40:43] will not be able to withstand it and
[1:40:45] I'll raise him up again at the last day
[1:40:48] that's the Easter message the Dynamics
[1:40:50] and mechanics together the mechanics
[1:40:53] without the Dynamics no good neither is
[1:40:55] the Dynamics without the
[1:40:57] mechanics the Dynamics and mechanics
[1:41:08] together I wanted to minister tonight on
[1:41:13] a virtuous
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:18] woman God has called us to a
[1:41:21] bride that is
[1:41:25] the epitome of a virtuous
[1:41:29] woman we're virtuous because we've been
[1:41:33] washed in his blood we're virtuous
[1:41:35] because he paid the price for us so that
[1:41:38] everything we did wrong is washed away
[1:41:40] and it's gone and so now we can stand
[1:41:43] there holy and
[1:41:46] pure to go into that archaic definition
[1:41:49] that I talked out before we can stand
[1:41:51] there completely chased
[1:41:54] we can stand
[1:41:56] there showing the high moral standards
[1:41:59] and living a life that's a
[1:42:02] witness living a life that is the same
[1:42:05] kind of witness that you've seen down
[1:42:06] through all the
[1:42:07] ages where people would look at the
[1:42:10] Christians and know there was something
[1:42:13] different that they would look at the
[1:42:15] Christians and that would Point them to
[1:42:18] the
[1:42:19] Savior the life that was being lived
[1:42:22] before them
[1:42:24] would make them want to look for the
[1:42:26] groom the life that the bride
[1:42:29] lives is what
[1:42:32] draws to the
[1:42:34] groom we're not trying to point to
[1:42:36] ourselves we're not trying to build our
[1:42:38] own platforms we're not trying to make
[1:42:40] ourselves be anything
[1:42:42] special but everything we do points back
[1:42:45] to the
[1:42:47] groom and we can read through the
[1:42:49] Proverbs 31 Woman and we can go through
[1:42:51] every single thing that she did that set
[1:42:55] her apart as being
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:42:59] special as long as we have the
[1:43:01] understanding that that applies to the
[1:43:03] bride as
[1:43:05] well that God doesn't lay these out in
[1:43:08] the
[1:43:09] scriptures for no reason he doesn't lay
[1:43:12] them out for even normally just a
[1:43:14] singular reason most verses have
[1:43:16] multiple things that you can learn from
[1:43:19] them and as he lays this out and goes
[1:43:22] through the different lessons of what it
[1:43:24] means to be a virtuous
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:29] woman he is looking at you and he is
[1:43:32] saying you are rare you are
[1:43:36] valuable you are
[1:43:39] trustworthy you are caring you are
[1:43:42] loving you are industrious and
[1:43:45] hardworking
[1:43:47] you are a homemaker you are the helpmate
[1:43:50] you are everything
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:54] that he could
[1:43:57] want he
[1:44:01] desires to have that
[1:44:03] relationship he desires to have
[1:44:07] that communication back and forth with
[1:44:10] us so that we can fully enter into his
[1:44:15] desires and living a life that is only
[1:44:19] living out what he wants us to
[1:44:24] [Music]
[1:44:28] he's calling
[1:44:31] us and we talk about it all the time
[1:44:33] that we're his bride and we're talking
[1:44:37] all the time about different ways to try
[1:44:39] to explain what that means and what that
[1:44:42] represents
[1:44:44] and you could Minister on virtuous woman
[1:44:47] in so many different angles you could
[1:44:49] Minister on the bride in so many
[1:44:51] different
[1:44:52] angles
[1:44:56] but in my own stumbling
[1:44:59] way to just point
[1:45:01] to God is calling us to live a life that
[1:45:06] points everyone back to
[1:45:09] him that one
[1:45:11] verse was the one that when I read
[1:45:13] through it just stood out so much to me
[1:45:16] the fact that her husband is at the
[1:45:20] gates but the scripture doesn't talk
[1:45:22] about what her husband does doesn't talk
[1:45:24] about what place he has doesn't talk
[1:45:25] about any of
[1:45:28] those but yet his reputation is
[1:45:32] affected by the way that she's living
[1:45:35] and the way that we
[1:45:39] live is what draws the attention to
[1:45:45] him we know that there are so many
[1:45:47] people in the world that they have been
[1:45:48] hurt in churches they have been hurt by
[1:45:51] people they have been hurt by different
[1:45:52] things and
[1:45:53] they then take on a lower expectation
[1:45:56] they take on a
[1:45:59] lower look at what God is or what God
[1:46:03] represents well the same way that that
[1:46:06] kind of Life can affect
[1:46:08] it how much can the life that's lived by
[1:46:12] the truly virtuous
[1:46:14] bride if the mistakes of people and the
[1:46:18] things that they've done wrong can make
[1:46:20] someone look lower
[1:46:23] at
[1:46:24] it then how much more can the truly
[1:46:27] virtuous bride living the life that
[1:46:29] God's called her to
[1:46:31] live Elevate and draw attention to the
[1:46:38] Savior that's what we're called to do
[1:46:40] we're called here to be here working
[1:46:41] we're called to be here living for him
[1:46:44] but all of that working and all that
[1:46:46] living is to simply be pointing back to
[1:46:49] Christ to go he's the reason he's the
[1:46:53] reason we live the way that we do he's
[1:46:55] the reason that our lives are different
[1:46:57] he's the reason that we don't just get
[1:46:58] messed up in everything that the world
[1:47:00] gets messed up
[1:47:02] in like brother William said he's the
[1:47:05] reason he got pulled out of the bars and
[1:47:08] he's not there
[1:47:10] anymore that's the reason that brother
[1:47:12] John got pulled out of his
[1:47:15] stuff that's the reason that brother
[1:47:17] Caleb got pulled out of his stuff and
[1:47:19] every single one of us can go down and
[1:47:21] go I got pulled out of this and I got
[1:47:23] pulled out of this
[1:47:26] because of my
[1:47:28] savior and so we don't stand here
[1:47:30] pointing and going see how great I am I
[1:47:32] overcame this see how great I am I can
[1:47:36] now lead you through a 12-step program
[1:47:38] on how to get rid of this or get rid of
[1:47:42] that we stand here and go no we only
[1:47:45] have a one-step
[1:47:47] program
[1:47:49] Christ that is our program yes sir
[1:47:53] we don't have this long list we don't
[1:47:55] have anything but everything we do every
[1:47:59] moment that we're here on
[1:48:02] Earth We're supposed to be pointing back
[1:48:05] to him and everything in our life is
[1:48:08] designed to draw
[1:48:10] attention back to
[1:48:14] him Lord Jesus Lord we come before you
[1:48:18] Lord
[1:48:20] and Lord I know that this isn't
[1:48:24] a screaming
[1:48:27] yelling excitable sermon this
[1:48:33] isn't well there's so many things this
[1:48:35] isn't
[1:48:36] but Lord this is just a moment for us to
[1:48:39] take inventory
[1:48:40] Lord for us to look at how we're living
[1:48:43] and and what we're called to
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:47] Lord Lord we thank you Lord I Thank you
