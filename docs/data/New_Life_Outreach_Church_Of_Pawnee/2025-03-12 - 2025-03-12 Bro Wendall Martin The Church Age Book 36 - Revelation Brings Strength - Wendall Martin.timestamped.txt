[30:54] age talking about our age as I have
[30:57] already stated this age melts into the
[31:00] last age it was in this age Jesus says I
[31:03] come quickly verse 11 and and of the
[31:07] last age he was going to finish the work
[31:10] and cut it short in righteousness
[31:12] because of a short work uh uh because a
[31:15] short work will the Lord make upon the
[31:18] Earth Romans 9 and
[31:20] 28 notice how this verse of Revelations
[31:23] 3:8 goes Open Door little strength word
[31:29] name that open door has to do with all
[31:33] three that now what does the door
[31:36] signify in John 7 and10 or or 10:7 it
[31:41] says then Seth Jesus unto them again
[31:44] verily verily I say unto you I am the
[31:47] door of the
[31:49] sheep that is right I am is the door of
[31:53] the sheep now this is not just a Quin
[31:56] expression
[31:57] this is actually so notice in John 10
[32:01] when Jesus is giving this Parable he
[32:02] calls himself the shepherd then he calls
[32:04] himself the door and that is what the
[32:07] shepherd is to the Sheep he is actually
[32:09] their door when I was in the East I saw
[32:12] that at night time the shepherd would
[32:15] gather all his sheep together and he
[32:16] would put them into the fold he would
[32:19] count them when he was sure that they
[32:22] were all in he would lay down in the
[32:25] open door of the fold and literally
[32:27] become the door to the fold aren't you
[32:29] glad for that no one could get in or out
[32:33] except by him he was the door the next
[32:36] day as I went riding with a friend in a
[32:38] jeep I noticed that a Shepherd began to
[32:41] lead his flock into the city right away
[32:44] all the traffic came to a stop so that
[32:47] the Sheep could go through now the
[32:49] cities over in the East aren't like they
[32:50] are here we keep all our merchandise
[32:53] inside but there it is like a big
[32:57] farmers market with all the produce on
[33:00] the pavement for pastor Pastor B to see
[33:03] and buy and I thought oh my here is
[33:18] where goodies
[33:22] she oh if I could have only known their
[33:25] language I would have stopped traffic
[33:27] myself and preach them a sermon on what
[33:29] I had just seen when you are a sheep
[33:32] that belongs to the Good Shepherd you
[33:33] follow right along in each of his steps
[33:37] just as those sheep did you won't be
[33:40] tempted to turn aside for some big
[33:42] flower of a church or listen to the
[33:45] voice of some DD or PhD or lld D but you
[33:50] stay with the shepherd the Bible says
[33:52] that the Sheep know his voice and they
[33:55] follow him but a stranger's voice
[33:58] will will only cause them to flee and
[34:00] run to their true Shepherd praise God
[34:03] but that was not all I saw and learned
[34:06] over there one day I got to thinking
[34:08] about having seen men in the fields
[34:10] hurting different kinds of animals one
[34:12] fellow was tending to some pigs another
[34:15] some goats and some camels another some
[34:17] mules Etc so I asked a friend who lived
[34:22] there what they called those men oh he
[34:25] replied they are Shepherds
[34:28] and I couldn't take that I said OU don't
[34:30] mean to say they are all Shepherds
[34:33] Shepherds only heard sheep don't they no
[34:35] he said a Shepherd is a herder or Grazer
[34:39] so anyone who grazes animals is a
[34:41] Shepherd well that did surprise me but I
[34:44] noticed a difference between the herders
[34:47] and the ones that took care of the sheep
[34:49] come night time all the others but The
[34:52] Shepherd of the sheep left his animals
[34:55] in the field and went on home the the
[34:57] shepherd took his sheep with him and put
[35:00] them in the fold and then laid down and
[35:03] become the door of the sheep oh praise
[35:07] God Our Shepherd never leaves us or
[35:10] forsakes US when Night comes I want to
[35:13] be in his fold I want to be in his care
[35:17] can I hear a great big amen even in this
[35:20] dark leot AIA we want the great Shepherd
[35:24] to be all around us amen you say how can
[35:27] to be all around us he knows your
[35:29] tomorrows he knows what's on the out he
[35:31] is all knowing he knows everything about
[35:35] you amen aren't you glad for that amen
[35:40] now then we can see that Jesus is the
[35:43] door he is the door of the sheep and
[35:45] notice that it speaks now of the door
[35:48] opening what is that but a revelation of
[35:51] him and that Revelation is opening up to
[35:56] bring strength
[35:58] to illuminate the word and glorify his
[36:02] name so the revelation of Jesus Christ
[36:05] the revelation of these seven Church
[36:07] ages the revelation of the Seven Seals
[36:09] the unveiling that has been taking place
[36:13] in this generation is to give us
[36:16] strength for Rapture so we're not going
[36:19] to barely make the Rapture but we are
[36:21] going to enter into that glorious
[36:24] Rapture because of divine revelation
[36:27] that has given us strength aren't you
[36:30] glad for that amen now he says it was in
[36:33] the midst of the last two ages that the
[36:36] revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ
[36:38] blossomed out before us yes we knew he
[36:41] was God how else could he be our savior
[36:44] but to know that he was only God or God
[36:48] Alone that he was the Alpha and the
[36:50] Omega that this Jesus was both Lord and
[36:53] Christ making him Lord Jesus Christ the
[36:56] Father the Son
[36:58] and Holy Ghost all one
[37:00] person that had been lost since the
[37:02] first uh Church ages but now we are
[37:06] seeing it again the revelation of who he
[37:09] was had come back indeed godhead is not
[37:12] a three-person god with one personality
[37:15] for it takes a personality to make a
[37:17] person if there is one personality there
[37:20] is but one person but they who believe
[37:23] in three persons have the three have a
[37:26] three good godhead and are guilty of
[37:29] breaking the first commandment but the
[37:31] revelation of the godhead is back now
[37:34] the true church can build in strength
[37:37] again after after all this time she
[37:41] finally knows who her Lord is once again
[37:43] we are baptizing in the name of the Lord
[37:46] Jesus just as they did at Pentecost let
[37:48] me tell you of a god-given dream I had
[37:51] about Triune baptism this is not a
[37:54] vision but a
[37:55] dream you know I'm not or you know I'm
[37:58] sure that one of the blessings of the
[38:00] church Ages was to receive Dreams by the
[38:03] Holy Ghost just the same as one can
[38:06] receive Visions it was about 3:00 a.m.
[38:09] on Saturday morning I had gotten up to
[38:11] get Joseph a drink of water and when I
[38:14] lay down I fell asleep instantly and
[38:16] dreamed this dream I saw a man that I
[38:20] supposed was my father he was a great
[38:23] big Burly man I also s a woman saw a
[38:26] woman that was supposed to be my mother
[38:29] but she didn't look like her even as the
[38:32] man did not look like my father this man
[38:35] was very mean to his wife he had a large
[38:38] club with three corners on it you know
[38:40] when you take a log and set it on in and
[38:43] hit it with an axe and it makes a three
[38:45] cornered wedge like piece of firewood it
[38:48] was like that he would take his club and
[38:51] hit her with it and knock her down and
[38:54] she would lie there crying and he would
[38:57] walk around with his chest stuck out and
[39:00] on his face was such a proud boastful
[39:03] look that he appeared to take great
[39:04] pride and satisfaction and beating up a
[39:07] poor little woman every time she tried
[39:11] to get up he would hit her I did not
[39:14] like what he was doing but as I
[39:16] considered stopping him I thought I
[39:18] can't tackle that man he is too big then
[39:21] he's supposed to be my father but down
[39:24] inside I knew he wasn't my father I knew
[39:27] that no man had the right uh and I knew
[39:30] that no man had the right to treat a
[39:31] woman like that I went over and grabbed
[39:34] him by the collar and turned him around
[39:36] and said you have no right to strike her
[39:38] and when I said that my muscles grew and
[39:41] I looked like a giant and the man uh saw
[39:45] them and then he got he was scared of me
[39:48] and I said you strike her again and
[39:49] you'll deal with me he hesitated to
[39:52] strike her again and then the dream left
[39:54] me I woke up immediately after the dream
[39:57] dream I thought how strange that was I
[40:00] wondered why I had dreamed about that
[40:02] woman when suddenly there he came the
[40:06] presence of God became known to me and
[40:08] the interpretation of the Dream came
[40:10] from him now you people know that not
[40:12] only have I interpreted your dreams
[40:15] exactly but I have many many times told
[40:18] you what you dreamed so that you never
[40:20] had to tell me the woman represents the
[40:23] Church of the world today I was born
[40:26] right into this m mess the mess that she
[40:29] is in she was supposed to be a kind of
[40:32] mother she is the mother of harot her
[40:36] husband is the denominations that rule
[40:38] her the three cornered block is a false
[40:42] Triune baptism into a trinity and every
[40:45] time she started to rise up and that
[40:47] means the congregation begins to accept
[40:49] the truth he would drive her right back
[40:52] down again with that false Doctrine he
[40:55] was so big that I was afraid of him at
[40:57] first but when I come against him I
[40:59] found I had great and powerful muscles
[41:02] they were Faith muscles the outcome of
[41:04] the dream was that since God is with me
[41:07] and can give me such strength then he
[41:10] can let me stand up for her against the
[41:13] denominational power of the world and
[41:16] make him quit striking her now I'm not
[41:18] trying to build a Doctrine Upon A Dream
[41:21] nor am I trying to vindicate any
[41:24] Doctrine I stand for by a dream Oneness
[41:27] of the the godhead is all the way from
[41:30] Genesis 1:1 to Revelations
[41:33] 22:21 but the people have been blinded
[41:36] by an unscriptural dogma of a trinity
[41:39] and the Dogma is so universally accepted
[41:42] that to try to see a one good person is
[41:46] all but
[41:47] impossible if people can't see the truth
[41:50] of the godhead but fight it they can't
[41:54] ever see the rest of the truth because
[41:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ in his
[41:59] church and his works in the midst of the
[42:01] church for The Seven Ages did you get
[42:04] that now I'm sure you understand now I
[42:08] want you to really understand as what
[42:10] brother brand if you can't
[42:13] see that God is unfolding him his
[42:17] mystery that God is is trying to reveal
[42:22] himself if you can't see that it was
[42:24] that great invisible God that created
[42:27] the body of Jesus so that that one
[42:31] invisible God could live on the inside
[42:34] of him in order to die and pay
[42:39] Redemption so that that great Eternal
[42:44] invisible God could come and live on the
[42:48] inside of you then you have missed what
[42:52] God has been
[42:54] doing see the trinitarians want to put
[42:57] it that there is the three Gods God the
[42:59] Father amen is is is is is helpless
[43:03] without God the son and God the Sun is
[43:06] going out and dying for the whole world
[43:09] and and and then it's the holy spirit's
[43:11] job to turn the whole world back to the
[43:14] god the son who gave his life and so God
[43:18] the son is crying and weeping and hoping
[43:20] that the world will all come to him amen
[43:24] that's not the way the Bible teaches it
[43:27] God knew you you are his sons and
[43:31] daughters and God had to die for you in
[43:36] order to redeem
[43:38] him hallelu Brothers we're going to
[43:41] you're going to live in this in this
[43:42] Frailty you young people are going to
[43:44] live in this frail bodies there's going
[43:47] to be plenty of times that you're going
[43:48] to have to repent matter of the fact
[43:50] you're going to have to repent on a
[43:51] daily basis because we are Fallen human
[43:54] beings but I'm so glad PR that there is
[43:58] ever more a blood sacrifice for everyone
[44:03] of God's sons and
[44:05] daughters that blood sacrifice forever
[44:09] more paid the price for you oh you say
[44:11] but brother W you just don't know you
[44:13] just don't know how bad I am I want to
[44:15] tell you the price that Jesus Paid for
[44:18] you was a price that'll go down to the
[44:22] very lowest it'll go to the very deepest
[44:25] there is no sin to Great there is
[44:29] nothing that you could ever do to ever
[44:33] uh H uh for a Son of God to ever walk
[44:36] away from the love of God God's love
[44:39] will hunt you down and bring you
[44:43] back Hallelujah he'll do it he'll do it
[44:47] amen how many knows that that the holy
[44:48] spir how many feels the Holy Spirit when
[44:50] you've done wrong and the Holy Spirit is
[44:52] right there just gnawing at your
[44:54] conscience gnawing telling you hey hey
[44:56] hey hey amen and and what is he doing he
[44:58] is saying I've redeemed you you're not
[45:02] one of those that's going to be uh uh uh
[45:05] you know f for the fire but I've called
[45:07] you with an eternal call
[45:10] amen well glory to God I love him here
[45:13] tonight amen now now so so I'm going to
[45:17] read that last of that of that to you if
[45:19] the people can't see the truth of the
[45:22] godhead but fight it they can't ever see
[45:26] the rest of the truth because the
[45:30] Revelation is Jesus Christ in his church
[45:35] and his works in the midst of the church
[45:39] for The Seven Ages and then he asked did
[45:42] you get it amen now now now to the that
[45:48] next paragraph he says Thou Hast a
[45:50] little strength and has kept my word and
[45:53] has not denied my name now we have
[45:57] already mentioned that the strength was
[46:00] returning now how was the strength
[46:02] returning with the greater the
[46:04] Revelation the greater the strength the
[46:07] greater the Revelation that was coming
[46:10] amen strength was returning to the
[46:14] believer amen now he says now as we've
[46:18] already mentioned how the strength was
[46:19] returning it was the power of inquis had
[46:22] waned and the people had left their
[46:24] homelands and demanded free freedom of
[46:27] worship the Yoke of the hierarchy was
[46:29] was being broken the governments were
[46:32] finding it wise not to Champion one
[46:33] segment against another in fact
[46:36] well-meaning but poorly LED people were
[46:38] willing to wage war to defend to defend
[46:40] their religious rights perhaps the
[46:42] greatest show of strength of religion in
[46:44] this age was the fact that though France
[46:46] fell in Revolution the great wesland
[46:49] Revival kept the revolution away from
[46:51] Great
[46:52] Britain and saved her to be an
[46:55] instrument in the hand of God for many
[46:57] glorious years the preaching of the word
[46:59] was never greater as Satan raised up his
[47:03] hordes of free thinkers as The
[47:06] Originators of Communism rose up as
[47:08] liberal theologians spread their filthy
[47:11] Wares God raised up Mighty Warriors of
[47:13] faith and the great works of the
[47:15] Christian literature and teaching and
[47:18] preaching come from this area
[47:20] era never has its preachers and teachers
[47:23] been matched and never will they be the
[47:27] Spurgeon Parkers clarans Edwards bunions
[47:30] muers brainards Barnes Bishops all come
[47:34] from this era they preached and taught
[47:37] and wrote the word they glorified his
[47:40] name the Judgment of the false Jew
[47:43] Revelations 3:9 behold I will make them
[47:45] of the synagogue of Satan which say they
[47:48] are Jews but are not but do lie behold I
[47:50] will make them come and worship before
[47:52] thy feet and to know that I have loved
[47:54] thee now we can not a immediately that
[47:57] this problem of the false Jew or false
[48:00] Believers were already in existence in
[48:02] the second age these who falsely called
[48:06] themselves Jews appeared right after the
[48:08] first outpouring of the first age now
[48:11] they appear again in the second age
[48:12] after the reservation
[48:14] Reformation this is hardly an accident
[48:18] indeed it is not an accident it is the
[48:21] principle of Satan the principle is to
[48:23] organize and claim originality and
[48:26] therefore be entitled to special rights
[48:28] and privileges let me show you back
[48:31] there in the saman age these people lied
[48:33] and said they were actually Jews or
[48:36] Believers when they definitely were not
[48:39] they were of the synagogue of Satan they
[48:42] were Satan's organized crowd for it was
[48:46] in an age in that age that we saw the
[48:49] start of men and the ministry taking an
[48:52] unwarranted leadership over the
[48:54] ministering Brethren Bishop said up in
[48:57] districts over Elders the next thing we
[49:00] saw was in the third Church in the third
[49:02] age there was definitely a place called
[49:04] Satan's seat that age gave us church and
[49:08] state marriage with the power of the
[49:10] state behind her the church would
[49:12] literally physically uh was literally
[49:15] physically Invincible but God broke the
[49:18] hold in the in spite of the power of the
[49:21] state and the Reformation brought great
[49:24] light but what happened the Lutheran
[49:27] organized and join with the state and
[49:31] again we see the synagogue of Satan
[49:33] manifested in the sixth
[49:35] age now of course this this synagogue
[49:39] group wouldn't say they're of Satan no
[49:42] sir they say they are of God but they
[49:45] lie for he that is a true Jew that is uh
[49:50] that is what they claim to be is one who
[49:53] is a Jew inwardly in the spirit so then
[49:56] if they are false Jews it means that
[49:59] they are as Jude 19 says having not that
[50:02] Spirit the spirit children of God are
[50:05] born of the spirit these have not the
[50:09] spirit therefore they are not children
[50:11] of God no matter how fervently they
[50:13] protest and to what links they try to go
[50:16] to prove that they are they are dead
[50:19] they are children of organization the
[50:21] true fruits are missing they are built
[50:24] upon their own creeds dogmas doct and
[50:27] the truth is not in them for they have
[50:28] taken their own counsel above the word
[50:30] of God let me show you what I
[50:34] mean uh what I have been trying to teach
[50:37] all along about the two Vines which come
[50:40] from the two different spirits take the
[50:42] example of Jesus and Judas this time
[50:45] Jesus was the son of God Judas was the
[50:48] son of predition God entered into Jesus
[50:52] Satan entered into Judas Jesus had a
[50:55] full Holy Ghost
[50:57] Ministry for how God anointed Jesus of
[51:01] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost with power
[51:03] who went about doing good and healing
[51:04] all that were oppressed of the devil for
[51:06] God was with him acts
[51:08] 10:38 it says for he Judas was numbered
[51:11] with us and had obtained part of this
[51:14] ministry acts
[51:16] 1:7 Matthew
[51:18] 10:1 when he had called un him his 12
[51:21] disciples he gave them power against
[51:24] unclean spirits to cast them out
[51:27] to heal all manner of sickness and all
[51:29] manner of
[51:30] disease that spirit that was in Judas
[51:33] went right along with the ministry of
[51:35] Jesus then they both come to the cross
[51:39] Jesus was
[51:40] hanged upon the cross and gladly giving
[51:44] his life for Sinners and commending his
[51:46] Spirit to God his Spirit went to God and
[51:50] then was poured out into the church at
[51:53] Pentecost but Judas hung himself and his
[51:56] Spirit went back to Satan but after
[51:59] Pentecost that same spirit that was in
[52:01] Judas came back to the false Vine that
[52:04] grows right along with the True Vine but
[52:06] notice Judah Spirit never got to
[52:10] Pentecost it was never it never went up
[52:13] to receive the Holy Spirit it could not
[52:17] but what did that Judah Spirit go for it
[52:20] went for the bag of gold how it loved
[52:24] money and it still loves money if it
[52:26] goes about in the name of Jesus doing
[52:29] Mighty things and holding great meetings
[52:31] it still makes more of the money and
[52:34] buildings and education and everything
[52:36] with a material concept just watch that
[52:40] spirit that is upon them and don't be
[52:43] fooled Judas went about as as one of the
[52:46] 12 and he did Miracles too he did not
[52:50] have the spirit of God as his own he did
[52:54] have a
[52:55] Ministry uh
[52:57] as his own he did have a Ministry he got
[52:59] he never got to Pentecost as he was not
[53:01] the true seed he was not a true child of
[53:04] God no sir it is it is that way right
[53:08] now in the synagogue of Satan don't be
[53:11] fooled you won't be full if you're the
[53:14] very elect Jesus said you wouldn't be
[53:16] full can you say
[53:18] hallelujah yes these folks say they are
[53:21] Christians but they aren't I will make
[53:24] them come and worship before thy feet
[53:26] and to know that I have loved thee First
[53:28] Corinthians 6 and2 do ye not know that
[53:32] the Saints shall judge the world not
[53:35] only will there be 12 Apostles on 12
[53:37] Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[53:40] but the Saints also will judge the world
[53:45] this is when the these who claim to
[53:47] belong to God and claim that God loves
[53:50] them will find out exactly who is the
[53:53] child of God and who is loved of the son
[53:56] yes that day is coming when it will be
[53:59] made manifest these who are now ruling
[54:02] the world in a
[54:03] measure and who during the last age will
[54:06] build an image to the Beast whereby they
[54:09] will actually rule the world one will
[54:12] one day be humbled when Jesus comes with
[54:14] his Saints to judge the world in
[54:17] righteousness this is exactly what we
[54:19] saw in in Matthew 25 when all the ones
[54:23] who miss the first resurrection will
[54:26] stand before the judge and his
[54:28] bride the eulogy and the promise
[54:31] Revelations 3:10 because thou Hast kept
[54:33] my word and my patience I also will keep
[54:37] thee from the hour of
[54:39] Temptation when which shall come upon
[54:41] the world to try them that dwell upon
[54:44] the Earth what does he mean by the word
[54:47] of my
[54:48] patience Hebrews 6:13 and 15 says for
[54:52] when God made promise to Abraham because
[54:56] he could swear by no greater he swear by
[54:58] himself saying
[55:01] surely uh blessing I Will Bless thee and
[55:06] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[55:10] after he had patiently endured he
[55:12] obtained the promise you see the spirit
[55:15] is speaking about the word which is uh
[55:19] which is given to us to wait for the
[55:22] Fulfillment of that word required
[55:24] patience even as it did in the case of
[55:27] Abraham and I think this is so true he
[55:30] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[55:32] he was patient and then the word was uh
[55:36] finally was fulfilled and I think I
[55:39] think patience is one of the greatest is
[55:41] one of the greatest attributes of God's
[55:43] spirit on the inside of you because it
[55:46] believes the word of God
[55:50] regardless doctors are telling you one
[55:52] thing you're looking at your family
[55:55] problems you're looking at this you're
[55:57] looking at that and you and yet when
[55:59] you're we and even looking at yourself
[56:02] and you're saying God gave the promise
[56:06] and we are going to believe Amen Brother
[56:09] David amen we believe that we stand upon
[56:12] that promise amen no matter the health
[56:15] issues or anything else stand upon the
[56:18] word god canot
[56:21] lie God cannot lie amen so
[56:27] um let's see here so uh I I lost my
[56:30] place here
[56:32] hallelujah okay so to wait for the
[56:34] Fulfillment of that word required
[56:36] patience even as it did in the case of
[56:38] Abraham he endured as seeing him who was
[56:41] invisible he was patient then the word
[56:44] finally was fulfilled this is the way
[56:46] God teaches his people
[56:48] patience why if if he why if he
[56:52] fulfilled his word in physical
[56:53] manifestations the very instant you
[56:55] prayed you would never learn patience
[56:58] but would become even more impatient
[57:00] with life let me show you this truth
[57:03] even more fully set forth Hebrews 11:1
[57:07] 17 by faith Abraham when he was tried
[57:11] offered up his son offer up Isaac and he
[57:15] that had the promises the word of God
[57:19] offered up his only begotten son there
[57:22] it is Abraham was tried after he
[57:25] received The Word of Promise most think
[57:28] that as soon as you pray in jesus' name
[57:30] over the good promise of God then there
[57:33] could not be a trial but here he says
[57:36] that Abraham was tried after he received
[57:39] the promise that is exactly correct
[57:43] according to the psalmist referring to
[57:46] Joseph uh
[57:48] 10519 until the time that his word came
[57:52] the word of the Lord Tried Him God gives
[57:55] us exceeding great and precious promises
[57:58] he has promised to fulfill them he will
[58:03] but from the time we pray until the time
[58:05] we get the answer we must learn to
[58:07] receive patience into our souls for only
[58:11] in patience do we possess life may God
[58:15] help us to learn this lesson even as we
[58:18] know the people of this sixth age the
[58:20] Learned patience we read the history of
[58:23] the lives of these great Christians what
[58:26] what a contrast we see between their
[58:28] lives and ours for they were so patient
[58:30] and quiet and today we are all but
[58:34] overcome in over impatience and haste he
[58:39] goes on to say to them because you have
[58:41] taken my word and lived it and thereby
[58:44] become patient I will keep you from the
[58:48] hour of Temptation which shall come upon
[58:50] the world to try them that dwell upon
[58:52] the earth now here again we see the
[58:55] overlapping of the two ages for This
[58:58] Promise has to do with the end of the
[59:00] Gentile period which culminates in the
[59:03] Great
[59:04] Tribulation I I also will keep thee from
[59:08] the hour of Temptation which shall come
[59:10] upon all the
[59:12] world to try them that dwell upon the
[59:15] Earth this verse is not a declaration
[59:17] that the true church will go into and
[59:20] through the tribulation if it meant that
[59:23] it would have said that but it said I
[59:25] will keep thee from from the hour of
[59:27] Temptation this temptation is like is
[59:30] exactly like the Temptation Of Eden it
[59:33] will be a very inviting proposition held
[59:36] in direct opposition to God's commanded
[59:38] word and yet from the standpoint of
[59:41] human reasoning it will be so very right
[59:44] so enlightening and lifegiving as to
[59:46] fool the world only the very elect will
[59:50] not be fooled the Temptation will come
[59:53] as follows The ecumenical move that has
[59:57] started on what seems such a beautiful
[1:00:00] and blessed principle fulfilling
[1:00:02] Christ's prayer that we all might be one
[1:00:05] become so strongly political that she
[1:00:07] Bears pressure upon the government to
[1:00:09] cause all to join with her either
[1:00:12] directly or through adherence to the
[1:00:14] principles enacted into law so that no
[1:00:17] people will be recognized as actual
[1:00:19] churches unless under direct or indirect
[1:00:22] Domin uh domination of this Council
[1:00:25] little groups will lose Charters and
[1:00:27] privileges Etc until they lose all
[1:00:30] property and spiritual rights with the
[1:00:32] people for example right now unless the
[1:00:35] local Ministerial Association approves
[1:00:37] in many if not most
[1:00:40] cities one cannot rent a building for
[1:00:43] religious services to become a chaplain
[1:00:44] in the arms Services Hospital Etc it is
[1:00:48] now almost mandatory to be recognized as
[1:00:50] acceptable to The trinitarian ecumenical
[1:00:52] groups as this pressure increases and it
[1:00:55] will
[1:00:56] it will be harder to resist for to
[1:00:58] resist is to lose privilege and many
[1:01:01] will be tempted to go along for they
[1:01:03] will feel it better to serve God
[1:01:05] publicly in the framework of this
[1:01:07] organization than not to serve God at
[1:01:09] all publicly but they error to believe
[1:01:13] the devil's lie is to believe is to
[1:01:15] serve Satan even though you may want to
[1:01:18] call him Jehovah but the elect will not
[1:01:22] be
[1:01:23] deceived furthermore the elect will not
[1:01:27] only be kept but as this move becomes
[1:01:30] the image Ed to the Beast the Saints
[1:01:34] will be gone in the
[1:01:37] Rapture you know we're getting we're
[1:01:39] getting close
[1:01:41] friends we're getting close and I and I
[1:01:45] know that that things are I I know that
[1:01:50] that
[1:01:51] uh most of us tend toward the Republican
[1:01:55] side of things you know conservative
[1:01:57] side of things but but I could see I
[1:02:00] could see how that even man an ambitious
[1:02:03] president could could very well make
[1:02:06] life pretty miserable for for for those
[1:02:08] of you who are not part of the
[1:02:10] mainstream
[1:02:12] christiandom that's right amen and
[1:02:15] willing to make a deal with with whoever
[1:02:18] amen and so uh I I I just I just believe
[1:02:22] that we're getting
[1:02:24] close I I just don't you just feel it in
[1:02:27] your heart don't you just feel that
[1:02:28] something pulsating in your soul lord I
[1:02:31] want to be ready now it says and this
[1:02:33] little delightful Winsome movement that
[1:02:36] started out in fellowship at Ephesus
[1:02:38] will become the monster of Satan that
[1:02:40] defiles and deceives the whole world the
[1:02:43] church system of the Roman Catholic and
[1:02:45] the Protestant and coming together will
[1:02:48] control the whole wealth of the world
[1:02:51] system and force the whole earth into
[1:02:53] its religious trap or will kill them by
[1:02:56] refusing the privilege of buying and
[1:02:58] selling whereby they would make a
[1:03:00] living this will be accomplished simply
[1:03:03] for the harlot's daughters are all but
[1:03:05] gone back to her in the meantime Rome
[1:03:09] has acquired nearly all the supplies of
[1:03:11] gold the Jews have the bonds and all the
[1:03:14] paper at the right time the Harlot will
[1:03:17] destroy the present day money system by
[1:03:20] calling in all the paper and demanding
[1:03:22] gold with no gold the system Falls the
[1:03:26] Jews will be trapped and come into the
[1:03:28] alliance and the Harlot church will take
[1:03:31] over the whole world the promise to his
[1:03:34] own Revelations 3
[1:03:37] 11-12 I come quickly hold that fast
[1:03:41] which thou Hast that no man take thy
[1:03:43] crown him that overcometh will I make a
[1:03:45] pillar in the temple of my God and he
[1:03:47] shall go no more out and I will write
[1:03:51] upon him the name of my God and the name
[1:03:52] of the city of my God which is the New
[1:03:55] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:03:57] Heaven from my God and I will write upon
[1:04:00] him my new name we don't need to comment
[1:04:02] on the thought that he is coming quickly
[1:04:05] we know that he is because we are in the
[1:04:07] end of the last days aren't we but he
[1:04:10] goes on to say hold fast what you have
[1:04:14] that no man take your crown it is in the
[1:04:18] midst of the of the time of the great
[1:04:20] trouble that Jesus comes and with his
[1:04:23] coming there is a resurrection
[1:04:26] many are to come forth Out of the Dust
[1:04:28] and rise with those who are alive but
[1:04:30] waiting for his return these will be
[1:04:33] given crowns why because they're sons of
[1:04:36] God they are Kings with him they are
[1:04:39] reigning with him that is what Crown
[1:04:41] signify reigning and ruling with the
[1:04:44] great king himself that is the promise
[1:04:47] to all those who suffer with him on the
[1:04:49] Earth all those who endured patiently
[1:04:52] knowing that God the just judge would
[1:04:55] reward them they who gave up all for him
[1:04:59] and committed all to him will sat down
[1:05:03] in his throne and share in his glorious
[1:05:05] Kingdom oh we have a word for us at this
[1:05:08] time it is to hold fast persevere don't
[1:05:12] give up put on the whole armor of God
[1:05:15] use every weapon he has given us use
[1:05:18] every gift at our disposal and look
[1:05:21] ahead with joy because we are going to
[1:05:25] be crowned by him who is king of kings
[1:05:28] and Lord of
[1:05:29] lords now he has not only given crowns
[1:05:32] but he says that these in the bride will
[1:05:35] be made pillars in the temple of God
[1:05:38] what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of
[1:05:41] his body as being the temple it was it
[1:05:44] was the temple of God but now that we
[1:05:47] are his body the true church is the
[1:05:51] temple of God by the Holy Ghost within
[1:05:54] us now now he is going to make the
[1:05:58] Overcomer a pillar in that Temple but
[1:06:01] what is a pillar a pillar is actually a
[1:06:03] part of the foundation for it holds up
[1:06:05] the super structure praise God that puts
[1:06:09] the Overcomer right in with the apostles
[1:06:11] and Prophets for it says Ephesians 2:1
[1:06:14] 19-22 now therefore ye are no more
[1:06:17] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:06:19] citizens with the Saints and of the
[1:06:21] household of God and are built upon the
[1:06:24] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:06:27] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[1:06:29] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[1:06:32] fitly framed together growth into a holy
[1:06:34] Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are
[1:06:38] builded together for a habitation of God
[1:06:41] through the spirit oh that does that
[1:06:43] make you want to shout yes that verse 22
[1:06:46] says we are building with them
[1:06:49] everything went through the door Jesus
[1:06:52] and is a part of that body or Temple now
[1:06:56] when God puts a man in the temple as a
[1:06:58] pillar he makes him a part of that
[1:07:00] Foundation group what is he what is he
[1:07:03] doing he's given him the revelation of
[1:07:05] the word and of himself because that is
[1:07:08] exactly what the apostles and Prophets
[1:07:11] had Matthew 16 And1 17 there he is in
[1:07:16] that word there he stands no one can get
[1:07:20] get him out Ponder that word
[1:07:23] overcometh John asked the question who
[1:07:25] who is he that overcometh and the answer
[1:07:28] comes right right back he that believeth
[1:07:31] that Jesus is the Christ he doesn't say
[1:07:34] that the Overcomer is one that believes
[1:07:36] in a Jesus and in a Christ but believes
[1:07:39] that that Jesus is the Christ one person
[1:07:42] not two he is the one who is baptized in
[1:07:45] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God is
[1:07:48] talking about the bride here do you want
[1:07:51] to see another picture of her it is over
[1:07:54] in Revelations 74- 17 and I heard the
[1:07:58] number of them that were sealed uh uh
[1:08:01] 140 and 4,000 of their tribes of the of
[1:08:04] the children of Israel of the tribe of

[1:08:35] the tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000
[1:08:37] of The Tribe of Benjamin was sealed
[1:08:40] 12,000 after this I beheld and lo a
[1:08:43] great multitude which no man could
[1:08:45] number of all the nations and Kindred
[1:08:48] and people and tongues stood Before the
[1:08:51] Throne and before the lamb clothed with
[1:08:53] white robes and Palms s in their hands
[1:08:57] and cried with a loud voice saying
[1:08:59] salvation to our god which sth upon the
[1:09:01] throne and unto the lamb and all the
[1:09:04] Angels stood around about the throne and
[1:09:07] the elders and four Beast fell down or
[1:09:10] fell Before the Throne on their faces
[1:09:12] and worshiped God saying amen blessing
[1:09:14] and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving
[1:09:16] and honor and power and might be unto
[1:09:19] our God forever and ever amen one of the
[1:09:23] elders answered saying unto me what are
[1:09:26] these which are arrayed in white robes
[1:09:29] whence came they and I said unto him sir
[1:09:32] thou knowest not he said these are they
[1:09:34] which come out of Great Tribulation and
[1:09:37] have washed their robes and made them
[1:09:40] white in the blood of the Lamb therefore
[1:09:43] they are Before the Throne of God and
[1:09:45] serve him day and night in his Temple
[1:09:47] and he that sth on the throne shall
[1:09:49] dwell among them they shall hunger no
[1:09:51] more neither thirst anymore neither
[1:09:55] shall sunlight on them nor any heat for
[1:09:58] the lamb which is in the midst of the
[1:10:00] throne shall feed them and shall lead
[1:10:03] them into the Le living Fountain of
[1:10:06] waters and God shall wipe away all tears
[1:10:09] from their
[1:10:10] eyes Jesus has come he has sealed the
[1:10:14] 144,000 he took 12,000 out of each tribe
[1:10:18] but there was another group that doesn't
[1:10:20] belong in that
[1:10:22] 144,000 who are seen in verses 9-8 who
[1:10:25] are they they are in the bride taken
[1:10:28] from among the Gentiles they are Before
[1:10:30] the Throne day and
[1:10:32] night they serve him in the temple they
[1:10:34] are the special care of the Lord they
[1:10:37] are his bride the bride goes wherever
[1:10:40] the Broom the bridegroom is she will
[1:10:43] never be left by him she will never
[1:10:46] leave his side she will share the throne
[1:10:48] with him she shall be crowned with his
[1:10:51] glory and
[1:10:53] honor and I will write upon him the name
[1:10:56] of my God and the name of the city of my
[1:10:58] God what is the name of God well he was
[1:11:03] God With Us or Emmanuel but that was not
[1:11:05] given that was not his given name Thou
[1:11:08] shalt call his name Jesus Jesus says I
[1:11:11] come in my father's name you receive me
[1:11:14] not therefore the name of God is Jesus
[1:11:17] for that is the name he came in he is
[1:11:21] Lord Jesus Christ what name does it want
[1:11:25] woman take when she marries the man she
[1:11:27] takes his name it will be his name that
[1:11:31] is given unto the bride when he takes
[1:11:33] her to himself well Glory Revelations 21
[1:11:37] 1-4 and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[1:11:41] Earth for the first heaven and first
[1:11:43] Earth were passed away and there was no
[1:11:45] more sea and I saw John I John saw the
[1:11:50] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[1:11:53] God out of Heaven prepared as a a bride
[1:11:55] adorned for her husband I heard a great
[1:11:58] voice out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:12:01] Tabernacle of God is with men he will
[1:12:04] dwell with them they shall be his people
[1:12:07] and God himself shall be with them and
[1:12:10] be their God and God shall wipe away all
[1:12:13] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[1:12:15] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[1:12:17] neither shall there be any more pain for
[1:12:20] the former things are passed away how
[1:12:24] wonderful all all of God's wonderful
[1:12:26] promises
[1:12:27] fulfilled it will all be over the change
[1:12:32] will come what will have been completed
[1:12:36] the lamb and his bride forever settled
[1:12:39] in all of the Perfections of God
[1:12:41] describe it who is able to do that no
[1:12:44] one think about it dream about it it
[1:12:48] read read what the word says about it
[1:12:52] you yes we can do all of that yet we can
[1:12:56] only know in an
[1:12:59] INF part of it until it becomes rality
[1:13:03] in the first resurrection I will write
[1:13:06] my new name upon him my new name when
[1:13:10] all becomes new then he will take upon
[1:13:13] him a new name and that name will be the
[1:13:16] name of the Bride also what that name is
[1:13:19] none dare
[1:13:21] conjecture I would it it would have to
[1:13:23] be a revelation of the spirits so given
[1:13:26] so conclusively that none would dare
[1:13:28] deny it but no doubt he will leave that
[1:13:31] Revelation to the day when he desires to
[1:13:33] give that name forth suffice it to know
[1:13:36] that it will be more wonderful than we
[1:13:39] could ever
[1:13:40] imagine the final admonition to the age
[1:13:43] Revelations 3:13 he that hath an ear let
[1:13:46] him hear what the spirit says unto the
[1:13:48] churches every age ends with the same
[1:13:51] warning it is consistent the consistent
[1:13:54] plea that the churches listen to the
[1:13:56] voice of the Lord in that age The Plea
[1:14:01] is even more
[1:14:02] insistent that uh than in the former
[1:14:05] ages for in this age the coming of the
[1:14:08] Lord truly draweth nigh the question
[1:14:12] would perhaps arise is there another age
[1:14:14] Beyond this one why the urgency or if
[1:14:17] there's is another age Beyond this one
[1:14:20] why the urgency the answer lies herein
[1:14:24] the last age will be a short one a quick
[1:14:26] word of
[1:14:28] consummation and not only is this so but
[1:14:31] one must also always remember that in

[1:14:41] if he comes within a few hours as he
[1:14:43] views time then he surely must warn us

[1:14:49] continually sound in our hearts to be
[1:14:50] ready against that
[1:14:52] coming oh there are many voices in the
[1:14:55] world so many problems and needs crying
