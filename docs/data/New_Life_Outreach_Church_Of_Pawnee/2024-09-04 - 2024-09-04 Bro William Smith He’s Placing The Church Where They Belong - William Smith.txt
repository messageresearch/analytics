every heart that's in this room and Lord you've done a great job sometimes we get ourselves in the way and Lord it causes us to fall and causes to go down the wrong road sometimes Lord but Lord when we find out who we really are and find out what you've done for us Lord oh God it's something on the inside that bubbles father father God and it's not because of me or them it's because of you Lord

name we pray amen praise the Lord you may be seated for a moment I know that there's some here that didn't know exactly what was going on with me and Sharon some knew that I was taking a pastorship you may be you guys can be able to sit down now too and um I was invited to go to sholo back in April through brother Dale Dale has had a burden for that church for many years and when he found out that I was actually going to drive right through there to go to New Mexico to look at a place where I used to go hunting he really wanted me to stop by there and so for two or three months Dale just kept calling them and talking with them and and uh when we went on our vacation and and going out to go help Dale for a few days uh we had the opportunity to go there before I moved here I was in brother Manuel's church and they there in Pint top lost their pastor and so for 11 years theyve hasn't they haven't had a pastor and I've always thought you know if if they would ask me as I was there with brother Emanuel if they wanted me to come I'd preach for for them but it never happened but for 11 years I've been praying for them and a lot of times when brother wendle would go see his mom and dad he would come back and he would mention them and and we'd be praying for them well when I was there and I ministered and that evening after we ministered we were sitting there talking and fellowshipping and and uh just listening to their heart I just thought oh my Lord give them a p Pastor whatever they can whatever I can do to help them let them get them a pastor when I left that place that night I felt like I lost I was leaving my children I come back here and I was just in lots of Torment a lot of pain and for them I prayed constantly you Brianna and Robert and Sharon would tell you that every time i' pray for for food I prayed for them I I would get up in the middle of the night at 2:00 and and labor and and cry and pray for them and asking God to send them a pastor well it got to a place where it got really bothering me really bad and Sharon was kind of scared so she told me I needed to go talk to brother Wendell or talk to somebody that I can trust to talk to so I called brother Wendell up and we had us a little meeting a year before that the Lord spoke to my heart in May um in Maine we were sitting on the side of the ocean and I was by some rocks and and uh we were looking for uh uh seag glass and and things and the Lord spoke to my heart and says I've got a work for you to do get yourself ready and I I I have been battling before then out of myself that because I tried to go start a church one time and it failed that I had complex against myself of the call that I had but through brother Wendell's preaching and his his counseling and and watching him and and things like that and the Lord speaking through the prophet of God I realized I needed to get my b lip away from my top of my lip and start forgiving myself and so the Lord spoke to my heart and I came home and I told my kids and my wife that I don't know what's going to happen but in a year or so God's going to put me as a as a pastor he's going to put me as a as a uh assistant pastor somewhere and that was all of it we never talked very much about it again one one year later the Lord put this little church on my heart when I went back the very SEC the second time it was to try to help them I had a list of ministers to give them to help them and the Lord did something the opposite those wonderful people fell in love with me and my wife I never entertained it the only thing I did was I went and I preached preached Evangelistic messages just encouraging them and the Lord was showing them that I was the one that they've been praying for for 11 years the exact paper that they were writing what they was asking every one of them asked each other what they were looking for was exactly me I didn't think that they were going to vote me in this soon I thought it was going to be sometime in the winter time but the lord gave us the opportunity to be able to stay in Albuquerque and work and go over there on the weekends so if there's any here that feel that maybe this went too fast and I didn't have a a time of three-month trial well if you add all the time I was there it was exactly three months and I just ministered and ministered and and uh they came to me and asked me if I would be their pastor and I felt like around the time of my birthday the Lord did put it on my heart but I kept it quiet just in prayer and uh when the kids came out in July the 4th uh they came to me and asked me if uh I would be their pastor and so we came back home and it ended up just being here a couple weeks and I went back out there for a month and so many days I really appreciate each and every one of your prayers they mean a lot to me I know brother wle didn't mention it across the pulpit but I understand me and him became buddies we've had a lot of fight not physical fight but battles with each other because we're the same age but God has given me a buddy and I believe I'm his buddy and so he's a pastor that I'll always look up to a man that that I feel that is is uh the pastor to my my belief of pony Oklahoma and uh those that I do talk to they kind of knew the situation but all the other ones that kind of was in the limbo please forgive me for not saying anything but I felt like it would be brother Wendell's job to do and I felt like he was hurting on the inside because if any of us leave it's going to hurt him because he loves us and so I really felt like this evening to let you all know that I wasn't rushing into nothing uh I'm scared to death this last four weeks I have been preaching as a pastor preaching a lot of teaching and we have seen lots of Miracles there's young people that are in their 20s that want to come to church and some of them are already are coming to church family members that are believe the return Ministry are was coming I made it very known that I don't believe in the return Ministry but God gave me an anointing me and I ministered to them and they are looking a little different today and brother Dale called me and told me that there is people just talking like might crazy there's people in his church that are related to people in our church my the church that I go to there and they are uh excited they see God just doing supernaturally in a lot of their own family members they're saying this man is not like the rest of them other preachers well I don't want to be like any other preacher I just want to be brother William I love young people I believe some of these younger people that are starting to be adults can tell you nobody else would go play football with them me and brother ml was out there playing football with them and uh brother Merl and I was playing against each other because he was a quarterback and I was a quarterback but you know and he beat me but that's all right we still played with the young people and they mean a lot to me and that little group means just as much as you do yes Sharon and I are going to be yes Brianna and Robert Is Here this is where the Lord has got them to be and so you got one ticket that we will be back because those two there I've got to see at least a couple times a year Mama might be more but I want to see you all too and so uh I know some of you in here are my bosom friend friends but it's 14 hours there and it's 14 hours here so if you really get tired and you want to come and see me you know where I'm at because I guarantee you I'm coming to see you too and so I just wanted you guys to know that brother William you can ask my wife and you can ask the church there my hands were off of this I wouldn't tell them anything I just encouraged they're the one that chose and so I ask you please if you love me pray for me this is a New Journey and I've got a burden for them I've got a burden for those young men that that are wanting to serve the Lord I got men and women that are 80 years old that thinks the world of me and I've only known him for five months and so please keep me in your prayers I love you church but this Mo this morning I got up and I've been studying on a thought and the Lord kind of changed my heart and if we can stand for a moment and open our Bibles to Galatians 4 I was going to say this as your looking at that took 5 months but it took almost 34 years to get me ready for what I'm going about to do I had to come here to be under a man that was going to get into my face a man that would cry with me a man that would jump down my throat a man that was my my age to be able to to minister not only the word of God but minister of the same gift that I knew I had since I was 26 years old knowing that I didn't have the education and and things like that so I knew I was going to have to really trust God but God gave me wend Martin to pluck a lot of things out of me and he put a lot of good things in me I've seen a lot of stumbling blocks that was going to help me down the road one thing he taught me was when you make a mistake to make sure you for ask people forgiveness and that's one thing about I love brother wendle so much is when he does make mistakes he does apologize and I believe he means it and so an encouragement to all of you yeah you're not going to he's going to say certain things and it's going to rip you apart but if you have respect for that office God will bless you when you stop having respect for that office shame on you shame on you you need to get back to the Altar and cry out to God because brother Brandon made it clear respect the office but I believe with all my heart if you can really see it that man loves you CU I know he loves me and I thankful for him being my friend but here in Galatians 4 we're going to start the first verse first verse now I say and I want you to listen to this very carefully because I want to talk talk about you this evening now I say that he says I say that their heirs as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so who are you today you're Lord of all you have been inherited to be Sons and Daughters of God today you might be a servant when you first come to God you might be you don't really know what's going on but let me tell you something before the foundations of the world you were Sons and Daughters of God but in but is under tutor and government until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children we were bound under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoptions of sons and because ye are Sons God ha sent forth the spirit of his son unto our hearts crying Abba the father wherefore Thou Are are no more a servant but son and if son then an heir of God's through Christ you may be seated that there you here you are when you were born upon this Earth today whenever the time was in God's mind you are already one of his children you were born speaking lies you were born to lie you were born to cheat you were born to cuss you was born to do everything the opposite of what God wanted you actually to be but because of the Fall something had to be redeemed and because of what brother wendle was preaching on on Sunday with Ruth I mean not yeah Ruth there was something about her that was special because she was a child of God why she was in that Kingdom why she was doing the things of the world God still was looking for her somebody had to go and get her somebody had to get her into a place where she's in her place and so tonight I would like to speak a little while on his he's placing the church where they belong do you know where you belong this evening church I want know where do you belong in this world today because people are going to make fun of you people are going to look at you funny because you say that you're a Christian you say that you got thus sayith the Lord you say that you got it but the atistics say that the religious world is the most made fun of in the whole country is because they have so many Hypocrites that's out there everybody said says that they're Christians everyone says that they got filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost every single one of them feels his presence coming down but God is placing his church where they belong I looked up the word adoption in the dictionary and this was out this was absolutely awesome your adoption into God's family was given you the privilege to live as a joint Heir with Christ in the inheritance of the father's house though you're United with Christ you can claim with a confidence in your inheritance as child the rights to God's promise and resources resources every promise in the book is yours all right every resource that you need to fight the devil is in the word of God but you've got to realize who you are these young ones need to learn who they are today and it's going to take you m and daddies to stand up as real Christians and live a real life of God in front of your children you can live really good sitting right here but what are you at at home are you really serving God at home or are you and your wife bitter and back and fighting and constantly fighting around their children and you're causing your children to get to an uproar or do you have a peace as brother wle says do you have rest but there has to be something in you to know what God is going to do for you he says here then did you notice Moses that great Mir Miracle performer that brought down Israel down through the land and brought them up to a Promised Land but did not Place their inherit to them he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but Joshua divided the land to the people isn't that right and the Christ brought the church up to the place to where now listen to this he said Christ brought the church up to the place to where their possession was made to them was given to them just the Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one who set the church in order Christ he died for you and me we saw him Miracles after miracles in his life as he was walking upon this Earth you saw him raise the dead you saw him be able to stand there in front of those men that were Scholars and speak to them and made them have to hush made them mad because this man had the Bible not only in a form but it was in him because he's the one that created those those things he knew who he was he knew that when he came down to that water and he came up out of that water the Holy Spirit was leading him just like it leads you and I today when he was a young boy he was able to speak to the Pharisees and they were wow they were shocked but you don't see him having no Miracles you didn't never see him having anybody healed until the the Holy Spirit came down upon him and when he came down that God placed him in his position right then and that made him power he was able to stand there when the devil was tempting him and only use the word defend defeat him but he had one thing he said right before he was gone he said Greater Works you will do than what I have done so where are those Greater Works well we're waiting for our we're waiting for our body change what let me tell you something Church there's people out there believe that brother bradam has to come back to get us in our place there's no scripture on that I don't understand when he said I'll ride this road again but I do know this that there is two prophets is coming because it's in the Bible and they're going to come to those Jews and they're going to preach the gospel to them and that 144,000 Jews is going to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior all right but the prophet that we believe has fulfilled Malachi 4 he's preached it and he's preached it and he's lived it but today the prophet's off the scene but there's tapes of the word of God and now it's up to you and me little bride it's up to you you to know who you are he knew who he was John the Baptist knew who he was Moses knew who he was Joshua knew who he was but who do you say huh what do you think just because you're setting in these pews doesn't mean that you're bride material but but if you are the bride you're going to die out to yourself in the way you think and you're going to act like Christians because the word's going to give you the power to be Christians he's the one that's going to give you the grace to be a Christian he's going to place you every Church age he placed those in each Church ages for their day but this last day we have to come back to Pentecost Pentecost had never left but the people left it that's why he's out there knocking on the door today if anybody would open the door he'd come and sck with him and fellowship with him I'm sorry to tell you but it ain't only the denominations anymore it's in this message that God's kicking they're kicking God out they're going with their Traditions they're going with their own belief they're kicking the prophet's word out and they're living what they think is right because of head knowledge and not a heart knowledge what we put in here has to go down in here it has to come through dying out it comes through suffering and pain and Agony to get us to a place in our lives that we know who we are and so now Joshua he says he divided the land to the people and now he says that Christ brought the church to right there but now the holy spirit is giving them where his where they're supposed to be so who's this great tutor today is he here in your heart today is he teaching you how to live as Christians ladies and sons of God today or do you have your own thinking or are you just wishing that you could be just like Peter in the Bible Peter had to die out just like you and me he had to he had to surrender his heart his soul to God and let God be the operator of that Soul we need to quit thinking and start believing The Impossible we don't need to understand we just need to know who the author is and if we know who the author is he's going to place you because now he's in control of you right and if he's in control of me I'm going to produce exactly what he made me for amen and so now he goes on he is the voice of God speaking through the inner man that Christ was saved the Holy Spirit now do you get that much now we're getting over into the book Ephesians now the same way he's positionally placing the church where they belong that's where I got my thought Joshua placing them into the natural land now the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land that they in the position that they belong in their inheritance we don't have to wait until our body change there's people out there in this message thinks we already we already got our full adoption if that was the case why do I still got great hair why am I still 54 years old I don't look like I'm 18 years old I had muscles my muscles are down here now they're down here I used to have good biceps and I had good muscles up here had good legs I can't even run from here to the door without falling down on my face unless I'm anointed we need to stick with the prophet of God what he said on tape we need to quit telling people we need to tell them exactly what the prophet of God's saying and leave it there because we can say it all day long but if you do not get the Revelation you're going to be stunned you're going to be there going what is that guy telling us he's telling we supposed to have it because we got the Holy Ghost I know I've got the Holy Ghost and I pray for this person he's never got healed yet doesn't work that way prob that God says he's only he said Rapture is already in you the power is already in you he said he can't give it to you all at one time because you can't handle it but it comes to a place where the dying out gets to a place where he gives you the power to be more Overcomers than what you're thinking in your mind because we said here sometimes and battle our mind saying well I'm supposed to be an overcomer but I can't even get over this I can't even stop looking at girls I can't stop looking at boys I can't I can't behave around my Mom and Daddy I can't do this I can't do that I can't do this yes you can get your eyes on the book get it off of the mirror at yourself get Jesus looking at him and asking him to help you and he will place you exactly where you're supposed to be we've got to come to a place that Jesus Christ is everything to you praise be to God Romans 8 and 18 it says for I reckon that thy suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in them and somebody else down the road but in US instead of putting us we need to put me revealing to [Music] me you got to look at this Bible and say he's talking to me I'm the one that's predestinated I'm the one that he died for I'm the one that he called I'm the one that he was looking at before the foundations of the world it was me that ain't being bold that's just the truth truth will set you free but the devil has kicked you and made you think you're nothing but when we get to a place in our lives that Jesus Christ is everything to you and me something will happen for the earnest expectation of the Creator waited for the manifestations of the sons of the devil no sons of God not when you get your body changed when you get your body changed you're going to have power over Earth and Heaven positionally place the church where they belong each one how we're called by predestination or adoption God has adopted us into the sons we're Sons by birth adopted and positionally placed by the Holy Spirit look they were everyone Hebrews when they crossed the river but Joshua divided the land and gave each one his land according to the utterance of his mother at Birth this joshu was going to do the same thing to you God in his mind already knew exactly where you were going to be on this Earth and he was going to make sure that's why he came down and he died on the calvary for you and I that's the reason why you and I have to go through the three steps because if we don't go through the three steps each one of them has trials and tribulations and wars and and things because you got to wrestle with your own self you've got to learn to be Overcomers with this if you can be Overcomers with this then you'll be Overcomers with every devil in hell Peter was looking out of his eyes and the strength that he had and the Zeal that he had they won't kill you I'll Fight for You Lord I'll cut that man's ear off he did didn't he he got rebuked for it too God don't need our help we need God's help we need to get to a place that he's thus sayith the Lord he's the one that's placing his bride he's the one that's got the church but what about the individuals today what about you he's got to get you ready so that you can be placed in the church hello somebody so now he goes on and he says look they were Hebrews right because of the utterance of their mother at Birth and now the book of Ephesians draws it together and positionally places the church now you've typed it with Joshua I typed it with Joshua he said if you notice Israel was brought up out of Egypt and there were three stages of their Journey one stage was leaving Egypt the next stage was leaving the Wilderness the next stage was canadan there are three stages for us one stage is justification the next is sanctification the next is the baptism of the Holy Ghost these three is labor pains hello how many can tell me that when you came to the altar in your car or wherever you gave your heart to God and it was not labor pains how many here that was so happy and tickled that they can say God I was a righteous oh Sinner and I use you in the name of all the name the vein and all kinds of things no you were sorrow you was crying you was asking God to forgive you you asked God to help me I'm a sinner Lord I know I need you today because if not I'm going straight to Hell the pits of hell is opened up it's ready for me Lord but Lord I need you Lord that's birth pains you you are struggling in that first age so was so was uh Israel when they were bound up by task Masters and being beaten and slaughtered every day people were dying because they believe belied in a God that was going to get him out in 400 years and God waited for 4 40 years to get him out but what was it birth pains they had to go through birth pains to be able to listen to God for the next stage of their life we've got to die out we we got to get to a place that God is everything to us because when you gave your heart to God you recognize that you were a sinner but they were habits living inside of your heart that had to be cleaned up they had to come out of thy heart they had to come out so that God can place you in the next stage they went into the Wilderness and because of their Stu berness they listen to man instead of what God told them that they would be able to walk across there and take their Mountain they wouldn't listen to the ones that had the fruits of the spirit upon them they they listen to the ones that didn't have nothing and they had fear and fear fell upon two million people and they had to die in the wilderness but the Next Generation had to suffer and go around that mountain until they came to a place that God was ready and they were ready to listen to God Moses LED them to the water but they had to cross it he brought them to their inheritance but because of the Harden of their hearts and I believe it's same way in this message today people have went to from justification and sanctification and got touched by God and they think they have the the Holy Ghost and they're standing there say I got the Holy Ghost and they're taking communion knowing that they don't have the Holy Ghost because they're too scared to stay in their seat and make sure they get the Holy Ghost so you're drinking in damnation unto yourself your attitude when you walk through that church can cause somebody to miss out on their healing your life is not worthy of the Gospel it can hinder somebody else in this church yeah right brother will give me a quote I will but we're going through labor pains how that God has set some in the church through the labor pains oh they great tremendous sometimes when the church is groaning under the pr uh the pre ution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just a real as was in the Pentecost how they groan and cried under the labor pains but when they are born and positionally born in the kingdom of God that's the when God can start using them that's where God starts getting the five-fold ministry going they get The Mamas and mamas learning how to take care of their children there's gifts there on the mamas there's gifts the nine spiritual gifts are operating under the Holy Ghost when them people have suffered through these three stages and in this last stage they've got the Holy Spirit deity living inside of them you have a portion brother you have a portion of deity living in you when you got the Holy Ghost so who's going to speak through you deity is going to be speaking through you and through that deity you're going to conquer the world you are possessors of this Earth this is your land amen but you've got to conquer this first before you can conquer this this is where a lot of people are today is because they haven't conquered this brother BR says people don't even have enough faith for a headache why because they're looking at the circumstances more than God's promises we need to die out to ourselves we need to give God everything but we want it easy my little lady my little sweetheart while we were in New Mexico she had a mind gr headache she couldn't even see she was just in her bedroom there we had to sleep in different rooms cuz the beds were small and she was in there and had the curtain down and walking by her door her head was banging cuz the doors were loose and it would vibrate she would just she would just go in oh it was hurting her but that little lady got up on a Saturday morning packed the bags got in the car with me and went 4 hours and served the Lord and was a testimony to the church in Pine Top before we left that headache was gone we're going to fight Church we're going to war and we can't go to war staying at home we've got to come to church and fight we got to fight at work if we got to fight at home we've got to get the devil out who are we are we sons of the devil or are we sons of God because the denomination says that they're sons of God and they got more Victory than some in here some of us because I'm I'm hit there with you church I look in the mirror sometimes oh man I'm I'm not feeling too good thank God Holy Ghost is on my wife we got a bill we got to pay you better get your reer end up and go to work something happened to me in this last five months I'm seeing a people that didn't even have a pastor for 11 years but they were standing on their Promises of God they kept coming to church without a pastor leading listening to a church message listening to somebody that would come and preach but come on Sunday morning and cry out to God for 11 years in birth pains and struggles and they love each other they don't talk bad about each other they love one another they leave the church and they go out to eat and they Fellowship Until Dark every evening on Sundays and it's like oh man I can't wait to see you again give me a call tomorrow what is it they were desperate they needed something from God what do you need church sometimes we got to get desperate we are so easy living it stinks and we stand here as Ministers of the gospel and supposed to be an example and you mam and daddies are supposed to be examples as your children what are we doing church are we in rest like brother brand brother wle said are we struggling because you don't know who you are you can know this Bible you can know the profit all you want to but you have to have a revelation from God revealed unto you personally that you are his and if you don't know you need to be in an altar somewhere and you need to find out well I've been in this message for 50 years I don't care if you was in 100 years if youd haven't been revealed because I know you by your fruits you know me by my fruits you know if I'm a hypocrite or not you don't have to judge me you can look at me and say brother William you need to step up son why because we're Fruit inspectors he has given us the eyes to see we know what real is so don't sit there church thinking you're okay strive with everything you've got in you to be more than conquerors amen hallelujah and here he goes I don't mean to be rough on anything but I want to tell you something those Mountain ladies back there our tough little ladies we prayed for a brother that signed his problems other sister his wife walked up and said brother William we're getting ready to go on a trip and my the doctor says my hip is all this and that and I I want to go on this thing but he said right now I won't be able to go because I can't hardly walk I can't even do anything I can't even hardly sit I can't even hardly breathe and we laid hands on her the very next day it would quit hurting she recognized who she was she was a daughter of God the only thing she had to do is believe that God was going to let her go on their 50th Anniversary his sinus has quit two hours after me and my wife left and he go I haven't had that same problem since what is it right is waking up the individuals are starting to see where they're at where are we at tonight Church as an individual not a church because I believe every one of you are Christians but we need to step up a little bit don't we why don't we let God Place us tonight exactly where he wants us and that is complete control over every demon everything that comes around you you should be have the power to say Satan get behind me brother William I don't have my body changed yet okay Joshua Joshua 1 says be strong and of good courage For unto the this people shall thy divide for an inheritance of the land which I showed unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and and very and very encouraged that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law now remember they're living by a law they never had the Holy Ghost they had a prophet and some of them murmured and complained about the prophet we might not say nothing against the prophet but we murmur against what he preaches because if we didn't murmur we wouldn't be doing the things that we're doing today we would be listening to God and we would be listening to him and we would be more than conquerors today we have examples that had cancer in this church and it's gone because they kept believing and kept kept telling the pastor I don't want you to keep telling him about it I am healed and God took her faith and today she's sitting here and she's know she's cancer free why because she belied who she is she trusts on one man and that's God he she loves her husband she'll take good care of him but she trusts in God's word for her hope and glory and so now he goes on and he says which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to be the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest isn't our Prophet said the same thing for us to this day this book of the law should not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good excess have not I command thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee wherever soever thou goest our own Prophet preached sermons after sermons on that promise each now this is where I read that that one right before this quote and now he goes each the land was provide provided and divided up by inspiration ation and each one could take the scripture and show it to to you exactly that he put them in their place where they were supposed to be positionally how that they too have tribes was to stay across the river how that the mothers cried that in their birth and how that each place was supposed to be and now after you are in that don't mean that you're out free from war you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on so see Caden did not represent the great Heavens because it's war and troubles and killings and fighting and so forth but it did pre present this that it must be a perfect walk they had to live by the law you and I don't have to live by the law we live by Grace when we make a mistake the blood's there but a man and daughter of God they will do everything they can and not sin the best that they can but what happens is we let this start wandering in the Caden land oh I wish I could have that piece of property oh I wish I can have that piece of property oh I could wish I could put my my corn on that piece of property because I know it'll really grow and then after a little while they get so quiet they get so out of tune with themselves and God and before long things happen and when something happens to them they go oh no oh I'm sick oh I'm this and that oh everybody hates my guts everybody's talking about me oh I do this and I do that why are we letting the devil kick us like a football all the time we are Sons and Daughters of God now not tomorrow but now and now after you are in that don't mean that you're out of free war he said there's where the church is falling today on their walk do you know that even your own behavior here's that quote I want to read to you your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed sin of your believers can cause the church to barely fa fail at the day of judgment he said you'll be responsible for every bit of it when you come through that doors you should be in love with God and love with everybody in the church why do you have to wait till you get right here and get right with God you should be getting ready for ready for God and God's children loving everybody when you're driving to work at your house I know this is hurting you guys I know why can't we have love out there but we'll go home with our own clicks and we'll talk about everybody in the church and we're all we all holy holy you ain't holy backbiters are not going unbelievers are not going but what is going is a man of God and a daughter of of God that is surrounded by the love of God living inside of them and they're producing the word that's what's going that's where God's placing those people are we one of them tonight but now they did all these years until now now we have the earnest of our inheritance oh my what do we have we have the evidence that God Liv lives we have the evidence that God is with us we have the evidence that God has not forsaken us that we are his and he is ours because we in our bodies we now Tabernacle of the holy spirit of God that cry out AB the father and there's nothing can ever take that away we are Anchored In what Christ that's why we got to go through these steps and be diligent in each one of these steps church because the first one can't get completed and when it is completed then you go into the next step what is he doing he's washing you cleaning you getting you prepared for what he wants you to do not when you get your body changed he wants to get you prepared that the Holy Spirit deity of God living inside of you today can conquer this mountain all right amen this inheritance Hallelujah he's giv you a body but today you've got to have be under control of this well brother William I can lay hands on the sick and they recover because God is looking at their faith because he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that person when you lay hands on them they're believing what you said and they get there what they need but why can't we lay hands on ourselves and say Satan I'm sick and tired of you come out of me in the name of Jesus because we're looking in the mirror too much you're seeing that old man instead of seeing the promise that God gave you before the foundations of the world that's why people can't get this because why they don't know who they are they have all the tapes they got the message and they can they can tell somebody about it but they don't have it in themselves I love this quote right here you want to go read a good message go read this is back in 1952 not not 60 not 61 not 63 not 65 not 66 this is 1952 thou knowest all things he said it's in me eternal life now we are the sons of God not we will be we are now that's what the trouble is says you absolutely are in there Ephesians 4 and3 says say grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby Ye Ye excuse me where for you're sealed until the day of your Redemption you have the earnest because he died for you he paid your price for you now he in the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's placing you in your inheritance he's letting you get your place in the place where you can use the faith and the power that he gave you to be Overcomers of this because when you're Overcomers with this you're Overcomers with Satan and all his demons because this is where he's attacking you this is where he caus you pain this is where he gives you the headaches this is where he gives you the the cancer you get a stomach ache oh you go to the doctor doctor talks to this I got cancer I better get my wheel up I want to die no I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus Jesus Satan get behind me look back to your sacrifice those stripes are for my healing that blood that was coming out of him is to wash me clean wash all unbelief out to get me to a place that I can get her out of the way and let God Place me in my inheritance and so he goes on and he says he goes let the devil kick you around that's the trouble of it today another Christian person that's sitting here sick if they only knew that they were Sons and Daughters of God now living with them not you will be now you are the sons of God now you've got it Pentecostal blessings the day of Pentecost fully come 1900 years ago now is the hour now is the time now is the accepting hour this is the accepting hour of the Lord now is when healing is supposed to be now is when Miracles take place now when the Christ is revealed and himself to to himself wait now he is when Christ is revealed unto himself here we are now not in the future the devil keeps pushing it off that's cism now is that today there is the hour there is the time and there is a place right now this is the day to serve the Lord this is the day to wash th mind out this is the day to get yourself ready for a Rapture today is the day that you are going to fight every devil you're going to stand behind the word and the word is going to come through you because there's deity living inside of you today you say you got the Holy Ghost then you have all the power that you need for your journey you just have to believe it it's time to get you stirred up it's time to get brother William stirred up it's time to grow what we say we are I want you to raise your hand if you're Believers tonight raise them hands up if you're a Believer and if you're a Believer then you need to stand up and fight every devil that comes your way and every devil that comes with your children you should fight them kill them and you need to sit them down and tell them what you are what they are they're Sons and Daughters of God before the foundations of the world not because of they're your kids God claimed them before you even was born they only have a nature like you but that nature won't be there in heaven it'll be a cleaned up nature it won't be a rebellion nature it won't be unbelief nature but it'll be power but you should have it today you don't have to wait for your body change brother Kevin it's today it's yours you should be able to lay hands on the sick brother William I don't think so oh yes you do he said Pentecost was 1900 years ago but it's still going that's why Peter and John can walk by the go to the synagogue to go pray and when they started they saw the beggar there and he walked up and saids silver and gold I have none but what I do have such as I give unto thee in the name of Jesus picked him up and he walked and praise God he had the Holy Ghost and he didn't have a body ch change he had the earnest of the body change now he had the life now he had the power now he had the glory now he has Sons and Daughters of God now because why he got himself out of the way he saw all his troubles what he did before Calvary but after Calvary he was still with his rip over his mouth but one day God said and go and go g it Peter bring him to me Peter I told you who am I Peter told him you're the Living God you're the son of the Living God you're Christ you're my savior Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this unto you but my Father in heaven I'll build my church on this rock what that rock means Revelation you need Revelation more than your next breath Church brother William needs Revelation more than my next breath from the time I'm starting now next time you see me I should be more into God or I'm backslid I'm tired of being backslid how many here wants to be backslid all your life up and downs up and downs up and downs you don't have to be but as soon as we get sick we're down in the dumps your mama gets mad at you you're down in the dumps somebody makes fun of you you're down in the dumps your wife didn't fix your breakfast and you're down in the dumps why don't you get up in the morning yourself a little earlier and fix a pancake and an egg for your wife and take it to her bed and say thank you for being my wife because she's the only one that's going to put up with us but we get so self-righteous are no better than a Pharisee and God can't use Pharisees he uses Believers he used humbleness people that love one another but he's placing his church are you part of the church this evening so the next time I see you you're going to be greater than what you are to right now because you're pretty great in my eyes today but when I'm on behind this Pulpit I've got to preach what he tells me to some of this stuff wasn't on my notes and I haven't been here for three months you know where I was it was only for a few minutes but I will tell you this while I was gone I kept praying for you cuz I love you I was praying for you brother Mitch I was praying that you'd be an overcomer I prayed for you brother John because I love you my buddy we're buddies man we're Bosom Buddies once in a while we just got to hit each other in the head say wake up what is it I need him and I need him and I need you and when you see me start falling down it's time to get up big boy get up quit balling quck praying Get Up Stand as a Son of God what are we doing we're pulling each other up that ladder we're pulling up that ladder we're coming up a little higher we're coming up a little higher what is it we're a body he's placing the church the bride in her position right but it takes individuals to be in that body so the toe's going to be lazy where the rest of the body has to get there and start working on that toe that hurts all the time my toes hurt constantly they're on fire all the time I can take this shoe off and you see my toes just red because they're burning and they don't have no circulation because I got bad back and got a right here a nerve going down that burns from here down all the time at night cramps cramp up so far two inches above my my calves hard as a rock in the morning my back is all looks like leprosy on my back cuz it's all tighten up but you going to ask my wife I get up every morning I shoveled with the tractor today 4 and 1 half tons of gravel by myself in two hours moved it around and look at me I said God I need your strength I didn't take nothing for it why because I want to be an example to my church my friends knowing that through my pain and suffering my Wars and Wars God is there to help me I could have called brother W oh man I'm in pain and I can't come no I want to be here even if I'm sitting in this chair back there I want to hear the word of God cuz I want to get closer I want to be placed in my position in Christ Jesus he go why it's for me now the hope of glory we are waiting for the fullness of the adoption he says this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from this vile cre creature that will we well excuse me B creature that we are and will will have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him as he is and we shall be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like his a glory glorified body and all the trials and struggles of life life will fade off into the little mist of blow away to never be no more now in the Old Testament when the son was born in the home he was a son because he was born in the house my son brother my son is my son when he was born to me and when the Pentecost Church gave birth and found that they were called the birth the new birth oh the Holy Ghost Church that they were born in the kingdom of God what did I just say when you receive the Holy Ghost you are born in the kingdom of God so who has the power right now Sons and Daughters of God now Amen brother brand said this I'm not going to read it but he this is I'm going to just quote it out you can go back and read it yourself he said you can't go and get on somebody else's property and do your corn you can't go over here and use this other person's on corn to do these things you've got to get in your own land yeah you've got to you've got to plant the seed in your own yard so the power that you have the fruits of the spirit will come from you from Glory they say that you have to be able to speak in tongues every one of us need to speak in tongues brother R says that's wrong he said you all have to prophesy and things like that he goes no that's wrong he goes no because one person might speak in tongues that's their fruits of the spirit the other one Tates the other one's a Healer the next one's a preacher the next one's a a prophet the next one's this the next one's that the next one's a mama the next one's a daddy the next one's a son next one's a daughter it's in the God's economy but God has to place you in your her let the fivefold ministry preach the word the church needs to accept the word and the word will place you exactly where you got to be if you believe you should be able to lay hands on the sick you little ones you should be able to walk in there on your your mama or your daddy when they're not feeling good and say silver and gold I have none but what God has given me in the name of Jesus get off my Daddy get off my mama get off my brother get off my sister get off my pastor get off my pastor's wife get off my song leader it's time for you to take authority of who you are but brother William I don't understand because you're not getting in the book and finding yourself in there you're listening to a message but you're not studying it for yourself you could tell your pastor that you listen to a message wonderful what did it do for you I listened to four messages this week but I was working and I can tell you certain things I things I could say but when I started studying it so that I would be able to help a congregation or a church anywhere I go I want to make sure that I'm preaching under the inspiration of the word for that day I want God to be leading me to a Rapture but when I preach I want to give somebody a drink of water so they can have the same experience that's why brother window labors on these things it's because there is some people here that's going to speak in tongues there is some that's going to be able to sit in their home and pray and things are going to happen Miracles are going to happen it wasn't just for the Pentecost back then it's for you now the hope of glory is in you if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's time to find an alt well brother will I don't want people to think I don't have the altar because I I've done this and done that who cares what we think you better think what he thinks because he's the one's going to place you he's going to place us one or the other he going to place Us in the Kingdom of Heaven or you're going to be placed in somewhere it's going to be hot so who are we he's placed in US everything I read is right out of the Bible and now of the message of the hour today and we stumble when a man says that we got deity in us and the prophet of God said it many many times he goes you got a portion of deity leing in you right now every Power everything that you need to go into a Rapture he said it's already in your soul you just have to learn how to operate it and a way to is that is to get out of the way and let him come the holy spirit will come through you and make a testimony out of you but you've got to get to a place church now Shake It Off and grab it behind your head and find that Nazarite vow and kill every devil that's in hell out of your life if you love these young people let us be an example to these young people these young teenagers need examples ministers it's time to step up if you're not going to step up you need to step down daddies you're not going to step up at daddies you better step down just tell your family you're worthless be honest cuz they looking at you you're worthless but a man that's solid in the word of God and he's good to his wife and he's good to his children that Mom and children look up to him and say there's nothing but love of God out of that man I failed my daughter many times I've jumped a gun many times but I've always made it right with her but one thing about it that young lady loves the Lord she's got a husband that loves the Lord and I'm glad I'm a part of their lives and I look through here I see each and every one of you I've seen you when you're little wouldn't even get in my lap these two right here I lived with for three months they wouldn't even get in my lap until the last week and I grabbed one of their books and I started reading it the way I wanted to read it and they both jumped in my lap and say you're not reading it right brother William they made me read it right and every day after that they were in my lap wanted me to read that same book to them and I had to read it right now we're buddies they made me cry the other day they said brother William you're in trouble I said what am I in trouble for you're leaving me I said I ain't leaving you I'll be back I said you can come out and ride my horses when I get them you can come and visit me your Mom and Daddy can come she goes you you going to get horses I said yeah she goes you're not in trouble no more but you know she had to talk to me she had to talk to me that's what we got to do with him we got to tell him our cares we got to tell him what we need and God will provide Church going to give you this testimony and I'm bragging on him not bragging on me when I left here to go back I was in pretty good size debt I've never seen God ever to take me or anybody else stop his work to take them over here and work to pay their bills and to do things the way he did it but there's a lady that wanted to help us I couldn't get this house that I want to get because I had too much debt and God put it on this lady's heart to write a check to pay my bills off I serve a big God I'm scared to death church but one thing I'm not scared of is to love him and to believe his promises CU he says if you believe me and you abide in my laws and you lift for me I'll stand behind you signs and wonders are following me not because of brother William it's because I want to die so much that you see this coming out of me I used to preach here as a deacon and I would preach on everything I saw and I'm forgive me for that that was wrong with me and I've already apologized to brother Wendell but I'm want to tell you something because I did that something on the inside of me had died out and today I want you to know that when I preach this gospel I believe it I've seen people come out of the Grave I've

our sisters sing and I was shouting and when the Lord was revealing to me this is the message I was going to preach something came by me and and I went into my scriptures and and I saw it but if you go back and you read in Gala in Galatians from 1 to 7 that sums up who we are as Christians but brothers and sisters we've got to live in our testimony we've got to live in this word with all of our hearts if we don't live with all of our hearts then you could cause somebody in here not get a blessing because of [Music] you I don't want to be guilty it's very important when we come to church

the youngest to the oldest Lord God [Music] Lord I pray one day Lord that there'll be across the table Lord and tears are running down their face Lord The Great I Am is going to walk by and wipe their tears away our bodies are going to be changed in a moment in the twinking of an eye and all the suffering and pain that we've been through and all the headaches and all the stomach trou Tri and all the things that's causing our bodies to to break down Lord will be faded away it be a m and blow away but Lord you've given us the word you've given us something today that we could be more than conquerors and Lord I ask you Lord this message I Minister tonight Lord they won't take it that brother Williams just being mean but Lord that something is real down inside of My Heart Lord that I just want them to know that they're Sons and Daughters of God and Lord that they have the right to stand upon the word and say every devil in the name of Jesus you have to flee they knew who brother brandham was they knew he knows who Jesus is they knew who Peter was they knew who John was they knew who Paul was Lord they knew who brother bradam was but Lord now it's us it's time for us to eat the book it's us today Lord to get ourselves out of the way that you can kick the devil Between the Eyes Lord takes the individuals Lord each Heart Lord has to come to the their position and Lord I ask you to show them Lord take them back into these messages Lord and reveal unto them the secrets of the mystery for this day Lord help them Lord help the ones that are sick Lord Lord help those that having these bad headaches Lord these are having bad backaches and pains and people people are telling them that they got could have cancer and Lord we just ask you Lord God to come on the scene and let thy children rise above the sin of this world it's time lord it's time for us to stand and be still upon Thy word help us Lord be with us Lord this could be my last sermon right here for a long time Lord I just plead and ask them Lord to get in thy word for themselves for the way window preaches it but it's a revelation between you and them Lord I ask you father in the name of Jesus to protect [Music] him let him love my little girl and my son-in-law Lord and put them around into their bosoms Lord when we go oh God I know they're in good [Music] hands oh God I love you bless this congregation bless brother wendle for giving me the opportunity to preach what's on My Heart Lord be with that little group there in Pine Top tonight [Music] Lord help them Father we love you in Jesus name we pray As we sing another [Music] song Love You Lord [Music] oh I'll sa oh while SE no more The Tempest May sweep or the wild stormy deep oh but in Jesus I'm safe ever more oh I've anchored my soul in the Haven of Rest and I'll sail the white SE no more The Tempest May sweep or the wild stormy deep but in Jesus I'm saved ever more we know that in this last leot in age is the age of being lukewarm and it's easy for all of us to get caught up in that Spirit of the age even though we know that's the spirit of the age even though we've heard the prophet say it over and over it's so easy for us to start to to slip into it I know that that I can be guilty of it allowing myself to get laxed to get uh for it to be for the word to become common for it to not be so special anymore and sometimes we just need the the minister to come through and remind us and whether we take that as them preaching harsh or whether we take that as just the Lord reminding us hey we're close to time to go home now's not the the time to be laxed now is not the time to let it be slipping now is not the time to let it become common we get so busy with the cares of the world and we get so busy with everything that we have to be doing to live in this life that we begin to lower the importance of the word in our lives because we're busy because we're focused on other things and that doesn't mean that we're wrapped up in sin doesn't mean that we're wrapped up in uh in a failure somewhere but we come so focused on just living life that we begin to to lose sight of what our real purpose here [Music] is you know I think it was a good reminder for us each to just check our lives and see where we're at and a reminder to to push aside that that lukewarm spirit that that prays on this age that is continually going around and trying to find that chance to help us to to make us be distracted to make us be focused on on something else instead of giving our Focus to our Lord and savior instead of giving our Focus to the word instead of of giving our Focus to listening to the prophet or to reading the message it can be so easy for us to either stop listening to the messages because we're so busy or even hit the point of hey we hit play but it's kind of going in the background while I'm doing whatever that's not to say that it's a bad thing you know that's in no way saying that it's bad for like the sisters to put on a message while they're cleaning the house or doing whatever great or if the brothers can have earbuds at work and listen to a message while they're working wonderful but we also need to be taking that time where we're sitting down and we're focused on listening or we're focused on reading and we're focused on studying that word is not just background noise trying to set an atmosphere but it's us going into the word because we're trying to get ready to get out of here the Lord's trying to make a bride ready to make sure that she's dressed right and ready for what's on the other for what's coming and ready to go to the other side I thought that was a really good message tonight and very Timely [Applause] we do want to continue to remember obviously our upcoming meetings be in prayer for those you know not just for [Music] um you know be in prayer for what each one of us is going to receive um you know we pray for that the meetings will go well that all those that come will be blessed but take time to be selfish for a minute think about what are you going to get what are you com coming to the meetings to receive what are you expecting from god let's remember our pastor he's traveling back from Claremore and remember those that weren't able to make it tonight I know sister Angie uh dogall is uh has an ear infection that's flared up again and so she was at home with that sister Denise uh had to go to the emergency room in in still water with uh extreme pain again they've admitted her there um until she's able to get moved um to I believe it's St John's and Tulsa once they've got a space there for her the doctor in Still Water thinks that she still has a blockage that is causing the problem so we want to continue to remember our sister there and just continue to remember each other as we go through the week until the Lord brings us back to together again brother Merl what can we sing as we dismiss we've been made more than [Music] coners Overcomers in this life we've been made [Music] Victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ we sing that again we've been made more than conquerors Overcomers in this life we've been made Victorious with the blood of Jesus Christ oh trouble may come knocking at your [Music] door don't be afraid you know it's not like before don't you give in don't let it bring you down you don't have to worry [Music] anymore we've been made more than coner yes we you may all dismiss yourselves comers in [Music] this live and madeore us through the blood oh let's sing that second verse now so hold on we're getting stronger every day there's no reason for you to go aay don't you lean to your understanding just lean on him and we'll all [Music] say we've been made more than coner Overcomers in this life
