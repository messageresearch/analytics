[47:51] just the Lord made a way just to come on
[47:53] over and you we just thank the Lord amen
[47:56] and just thankful to be in the house of

[48:00] have your Bibles we'll go straight to
[48:01] the word and don't want to hold you long
[48:04] tonight we'll turn to two texts but
[48:07] we'll start in Galatians
[48:10] 4 vers 22 starting Galatians 4 verse
[48:16] 22 amen I'm happen to use brother Josh's
[48:20] Bible tonight because I went to a Bible
[48:22] Conference and forgot my
[48:24] Bible so that's a little embarrassing
[48:28] but he was gracious all right Galatians
[48:32] 4 and then we'll turn over to John
[48:34] 8 Galatians 4:22 says for it is written
[48:38] that Abraham had two sons the one by a
[48:41] bond made the other by a free woman yeah
[48:44] but he who was of the Bond woman was
[48:45] born after the flesh but he of the free
[48:48] woman was by promise which things are an
[48:50] allegory for these are the two covenants
[48:53] the one from the Mount Si which
[48:55] gendereth to bondage which is AAR for
[48:57] this AAR is Mount Si in Arabia and anth
[49:00] to Jerusalem which now is and is in
[49:02] bondage with her children but Jerusalem
[49:05] which is above is free which is the
[49:07] mother of us all for it is written
[49:09] Rejoice thou baren that bearest not and
[49:11] break forth and cry thou that travest
[49:14] not for the desolate hath many more
[49:16] children than she which hath an husband
[49:18] now we Brethren as Isaac was are the
[49:20] children of promise but as then he that
[49:23] was born after the flesh persecuted him
[49:25] that was born after the spirit even so
[49:27] it is now nevertheless what saith the
[49:29] scripture cast out the Bond woman and
[49:31] her son for the son of the Bond woman
[49:33] shall not be a with the son of the free
[49:35] woman so then brethren we are not
[49:37] children of the Bond woman but of the
[49:39] free yes and then in John 8 uh just a
[49:42] few verses here starting in verse
[49:45] 31 it says then said Jesus to those Jews
[49:49] which believed on him if you continue in
[49:52] my word then are you my disciples indeed
[49:54] and you shall know the the truth and the
[49:56] truth shall make you free they answered
[49:58] and we be Abraham seed and were never in
[50:01] bondage to any man how sayest thou you
[50:03] shall be made free then Jesus answered
[50:06] them verily verily I say unto you
[50:07] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[50:09] of sin and the servant abideth not in
[50:12] the house forever but the son abideth
[50:13] forever if the son therefore shall make
[50:16] you free you shall be free indeed and
[50:18] then verse 33 why do you not understand
[50:21] my speech even because you cannot hear
[50:23] my word and then down to verse 4 7 he
[50:26] that is of God heareth God's words ye
[50:29] therefore hear them not because you are
[50:31] not of God am mean we could bow our
[50:33] heads for a word of prayer father we
[50:35] just thank you Lord for your grace
[50:37] father that you've extended to us Lord
[50:39] and Lord we look back father where we
[50:41] came from father when we realize it
[50:44] could only be the tender hand of God
[50:46] Lord that could guide us through Lord
[50:48] great trials and heartaches father of
[50:50] life and to realize Lord that it was all
[50:53] part of your plan father and you
[50:55] purposed it Lord and you ordained us
[50:57] Lord before the foundation of the world
[50:59] Lord to walk with you and father Lord we
[51:02] grew Lord through through all the the
[51:05] dirt and the Darkness of this life into
[51:08] Lord the revelation of knowing who we
[51:10] are father Lord that you've called us
[51:12] and elected us for this hour and father
[51:15] Lord we just ask that you come by this
[51:18] way Lord that if there be one that
[51:20] doesn't know who they are father that
[51:22] Lord they be in in the darkness Lord or
[51:25] deep trial maybe some sick in their body
[51:27] father Lord that you come by Lord in
[51:29] your great power and might and just
[51:31] speak to the hearts of your children
[51:33] Lord have your way we pray in Jesus name
[51:36] amen and you may be seated just want to
[51:38] take a short thought out of those texts
[51:40] on bride Thou Art free indeed uh free
[51:43] indeed it's just really been something
[51:46] uh just dealing with my heart on on
[51:48] freedom and how the truth has set us
[51:51] free and and what Freedom really means
[51:53] and brother brandom um preaches the
[51:56] message a Year of Jubilee and return and
[51:58] Jubilee and and lays under that thought
[52:00] of Jubilee and and how the children of
[52:03] Israel had an inheritance uh and Joshua
[52:06] was placing them in that inheritance
[52:08] each one where they belonged in their
[52:10] specific position and and no one could
[52:12] take their spot but there was a an
[52:14] adoption a placing of the children of
[52:16] Israel in each position but in the
[52:19] course of time they could lose their
[52:21] inheritance due to Poverty or different
[52:23] situations and and they could fall away
[52:25] from the right position but God provided
[52:28] a way that after 50 years there would be
[52:30] a jubilee and at the sounding of the
[52:32] trumpet there that they could return
[52:34] back to their inheritance that that had
[52:37] God had given them as children of Israel
[52:39] that they could return back and no
[52:41] matter what had taken place no matter
[52:43] where they found themselves God provided
[52:45] a way that they could return back to
[52:47] their inheritance and as we read in John
[52:49] 8 it said the servant abideth not in the
[52:51] house forever but the son abideth
[52:53] forever and brother Brandon would take
[52:55] that scripture and show you that Jubilee
[52:57] isn't just for it's not for servants
[52:59] actually it's for Sons it's for sons
[53:01] that were children of Israel born
[53:03] Israelites not for servants that were
[53:05] that were bought or or selected but it
[53:07] was for born Sons you had to be born
[53:10] into it just the same as brother Brandon
[53:12] would take the S on Jubilee and parallel
[53:14] it with the adoption of the church that
[53:16] it's for born Sons those who before the
[53:18] foundation of the world were
[53:19] predestinated under this adoption that's
[53:22] who this Jubilee is for it's not just
[53:23] for anybody it's not just for the world
[53:26] or or the natural church but it's for
[53:27] born sons that could hear the sound of
[53:30] the trumpet and that they could return
[53:32] to their inheritance as children of God
[53:34] and walk free in the light that God God
[53:37] had called him to amen so it wasn't just
[53:39] for anybody but it was for somebody that
[53:42] could know the sound of the trumpet amen
[53:45] and Grace could return them to their
[53:47] rightful inheritance no matter how far
[53:50] they had gone away and brother bam said
[53:51] I believe this is the hour of Jubilee
[53:53] again only this time it's not not a
[53:55] priest sounding a natural trumpet right
[53:57] but it's a gospel
[53:59] Minister a preacher sounding forth the
[54:01] gospel declaring the Jubilee that if
[54:04] you're a Son of God if you can recognize
[54:07] the sound of the trumpet as a sheep
[54:09] hears the voice of the shepherd you can
[54:11] follow it and go free back to your
[54:14] inheritance as children of God for for
[54:16] man was not made to be a slave man was
[54:18] made to be free man was never made to be
[54:20] ruled over by man or to be ruled over by
[54:23] by anything else other than random would
[54:25] say that that you're a Freeborn servant
[54:27] of God you don't want nobody to be
[54:28] slaves nothing to dominate over us but
[54:31] himself mean that's the only Dominion
[54:34] that we have is almighty God over our
[54:36] lives no man is to dominate over us no
[54:39] Creed no Dogma no denomination you were
[54:41] never meant to be a slave to any of that
[54:44] the only headship that we have brother
[54:46] Josh is the word of the hour the message
[54:48] that God sent us he's our only Dominion
[54:51] he's our only headship no other headship
[54:53] no other rulership we not in bondage
[54:56] anymore but we've been liberated amen by
[54:59] the word of the hour and we're free
[55:01] we're we're not meant to be uh slaves or
[55:04] or ruled over by by these things and you
[55:06] can see brother Brandon's attitude on
[55:08] slavery for he would look out at a
[55:10] natural slavery how they would sell them
[55:12] he said just like a like a used car sell
[55:15] that they would just uh sell humans to
[55:17] other humans it was pitiful to to see
[55:19] that he said it should never be and and
[55:22] he would look to Abraham Lincoln as a
[55:24] little bit of a role model cuz Abraham
[55:25] Lincoln would look out on that and say
[55:27] he said I'll hit it if it takes my life
[55:29] I'll hit this slavery if it takes my
[55:32] life and brother Brandon would look out
[55:33] upon humanity and the unbelief that
[55:36] plagued sons and daughters and he said
[55:37] I'll hit it if it takes my life I will
[55:40] not stand here and let Sons and
[55:42] Daughters of God be caged by the
[55:44] cunningness of man but I will hit it if
[55:46] it takes my life I'll preach the word
[55:48] and Truth I'll preach it in Clarity I'll
[55:50] preach it without any opinion because
[55:52] there's got to be a people who will live
[55:54] free
[55:55] outside of this cage he would look and
[55:57] said the saddest thing I ever saw was
[55:59] that eagle in the cage beating its head
[56:02] beating its wings Against the Cage an
[56:04] eagle that was born for the sky Born to
[56:06] Be Free the saddest side I ever saw but
[56:08] not as sad as the the men and woman that
[56:11] would walk down the streets and here
[56:13] this Eagle was caged by Humanity
[56:15] Humanity put them in that cage he said I
[56:17] see men and women walking down the
[56:19] street but but they're not CA they're
[56:21] caged by the cunningness of man
[56:22] spiritually under religious C
[56:25] men who wouldn't preach the whole truth
[56:27] but they build a kingdom of their own
[56:29] and put Humanity in a cage and limit
[56:32] them to their idea but but not preach to
[56:34] them the full word that they could walk
[56:35] in Liberty but there was a prophet on
[56:37] the scene that could take the word and
[56:39] preach it in power in fullness that Sons
[56:42] and Daughters of God could walk in the
[56:44] liberty of the word not caged by any man
[56:47] amen it's a liberty Amen brother brandom
[56:51] uh had that about him he had that desire
[56:54] for freedom for Liberty to see children
[56:56] of God Walk in Freedom man was not made
[57:00] to rule over man uh brother Brandon
[57:03] would say uh you know uh that that man
[57:05] was not made to rule over man but on the
[57:07] day of Pentecost he sent the Holy Ghost
[57:09] to rule in the hearts of men he said
[57:11] I'll not leave you comfortless but I
[57:13] will send you a leadership I'll send you
[57:16] something to lead you you're not meant
[57:17] to be ruled over by man you see the
[57:19] children of Israel in the olden days
[57:22] when they would go through the desert am
[57:24] mean Almighty God would rule over them
[57:26] he would lead them into battle and
[57:28] brother brand say he was a king to them
[57:29] he was a father King he busied himself
[57:32] over them he took care of them he fed
[57:34] him can you imagine just being led by a
[57:36] pillar of fire through the Wilderness
[57:38] and he's fighting your battles a pillar
[57:41] of cloud he's drowning your enemies in
[57:43] the sea you can you imagine that kind of
[57:45] a a victory but then they looked out
[57:48] brother Josh and they seen the armies of
[57:50] the Philistines and they seen all these
[57:52] other armies and they had a natural King
[57:54] to leave lead them into battle and they
[57:56] begin to covet that and say we want a
[57:58] king like them to lead us into battle
[58:00] and said we don't want to change
[58:01] anything we still want to blow the
[58:03] trumpets we still want to sing the songs
[58:05] but we want natural leadership instead
[58:07] of the leadership of almighty God and
[58:09] when they did that they rejected the
[58:11] very thing that made them different it
[58:13] wasn't the trumpets that made them
[58:14] different it wasn't the songs that made
[58:16] them different it was the leadership of
[58:18] the Holy Ghost that made them different
[58:20] that's what caused the signs and wonders
[58:22] to follow him that's what caused them to
[58:24] be victorious in battle not just the
[58:26] priest or the singing But the leadership
[58:28] and of almighty God the pillar of fire
[58:30] leading the church is what made him
[58:32] different he said oh we'll still sing
[58:34] the songs we'll still quote the quotes
[58:36] we'll still dress right and do our hair
[58:38] long but we don't want that Holy Ghost
[58:40] leadership and they rejected the very
[58:42] thing that made them different and chose
[58:44] rather to be ruled over by Humanity they
[58:47] would rather have Saul the son of Kish
[58:49] to lead him and even though Saul
[58:51] couldn't produce what the leadership of
[58:53] God could produce
[58:55] but there's something about man that
[58:57] wants to be ruled over by man and they
[59:00] want to rule over man but Humanity
[59:03] rejects the leadership of God like this
[59:06] nation rejected real leadership of God
[59:09] brother brandom said and then astounded
[59:10] me when when when they were signing the
[59:12] Declaration of Independence he said
[59:14] there's not one Speck in my mind the son
[59:16] of God sat at that table it wasn't a
[59:19] speck in the prophet's mind that when
[59:21] this nation was founded the Son of God
[59:23] sat in the room when this nation was
[59:25] founded but they rejected it they
[59:27] rejected it for the what the world had
[59:29] to offer and we're not meant we've been
[59:31] freed from the rulership of man but but
[59:34] it doesn't do away say well if that's
[59:36] the case I'll just go out and I'll just
[59:38] listen to tapes I'll just I don't need I
[59:40] don't need Pastor I don't need the
[59:41] Evangelist but that's not what it means
[59:43] because almighty God set an order to
[59:46] this leadership brother BR said I
[59:47] believe in leadership but I also believe
[59:49] God has set men in the church who will
[59:52] lead and who who will take care of all
[59:54] order but but but because they're
[59:56] Spirit-filled men it's not really the
[59:58] leadership of man it's the leadership of
[1:00:01] God by the word through those men so
[1:00:03] you're not really subjecting yourself to
[1:00:05] any other leadership it's just God has
[1:00:07] placed man in the church to Lead You by
[1:00:10] Holy Ghost leadership amen so if you got
[1:00:12] a real god- calleded Pastor it's not a
[1:00:14] different agenda than what God has it's
[1:00:17] not a different a different a plan than
[1:00:19] what this message has but it's just the
[1:00:22] spirit leading through Humanity
[1:00:25] but almighty God is still our headship
[1:00:28] amen we're not meant to be prisoners to
[1:00:30] man or to church to church systems we've
[1:00:33] been called out of it we've been called
[1:00:35] out of the systems brother Wendell we're
[1:00:37] not meant to be ruled over by it um you
[1:00:40] know brother Brandon would talk to many
[1:00:41] people many times and say well you know
[1:00:43] are you are you a Christian said I'll
[1:00:45] give you to know I burn a candle every
[1:00:47] night I'll give you to know I'm a
[1:00:49] Methodist I'm a presbyterian I'm a
[1:00:51] Baptist that that has nothing to do with
[1:00:54] it is that people can get down at an
[1:00:56] altar and have maybe somewhat of a
[1:00:58] sensation uh in the denominational
[1:01:01] systems they would have an experience
[1:01:03] but they would get up and and they would
[1:01:04] have no love for the Lord they would
[1:01:06] have no real walk all they would talk
[1:01:08] about is well my church this in my
[1:01:10] church that because they really didn't
[1:01:12] never get the spirit of God they got a
[1:01:14] church Spirit instead of the spirit of
[1:01:16] God and there's a big difference between
[1:01:18] a church Spirit and the spirit of God
[1:01:20] but when God gets a hold of your life
[1:01:22] he'll change you it's spirit in you you
[1:01:25] don't love the world or the things of
[1:01:26] the world anymore you've got a different
[1:01:28] leadership it's the leadership of
[1:01:30] almighty God and it's a huge difference
[1:01:32] and I don't think we should water down
[1:01:34] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost just
[1:01:36] to just to a church Spirit just to
[1:01:38] belong to a group or pH a Pew but when
[1:01:41] you're born of God you're a new creature
[1:01:43] deity dwells inside of you it'll change
[1:01:46] your life it'll teach you how to walk
[1:01:48] it'll teach you how to talk it'll
[1:01:50] dissolve all doubts about this message
[1:01:53] because it's not a church spirit
[1:01:55] almighty God dwells inside of your being
[1:01:57] he's the one leading you it's not a
[1:01:59] church Spirit don't be deceived in your
[1:02:02] experience to be a Christian is to be
[1:02:05] Christlike me it's the Bride versus the
[1:02:08] church as we read the Bond woman shall
[1:02:11] not be Heir with the son of the free
[1:02:13] woman one is the bride brother BR said
[1:02:15] they'll not be heirs together they're
[1:02:17] not associated together they're
[1:02:18] absolutely two different promises two
[1:02:21] different times two different peoples
[1:02:22] all together one is the bride and the
[1:02:25] other one is a church no comparison in
[1:02:27] them at all just as Ishmael and Isaac
[1:02:30] could not be airs together the bride and
[1:02:32] the church cannot be hirs together it's
[1:02:34] completely different it's brother Ram
[1:02:36] said the natural church and the
[1:02:38] spiritual church cannot be HS together
[1:02:40] they are two different separate times
[1:02:42] two different separate people under two
[1:02:44] different separate covenants you're not
[1:02:47] under the same Covenant you're not
[1:02:49] you're not the same as the natural
[1:02:51] Church you're different and it's
[1:02:53] important to know who you are and what
[1:02:56] promises belong to you for for you're a
[1:02:58] special people you're his bride and
[1:03:00] you're under a different Covenant you're
[1:03:02] not under the law of Mount Si you're not
[1:03:05] under the law and the dictatorship of
[1:03:06] men but you're under grace you're his
[1:03:09] Covenant people you're you're part of
[1:03:11] Abraham's Grace Covenant because you're
[1:03:13] not just a you're not just a part of
[1:03:15] ishmail or you're not even you're not
[1:03:17] even didn't maybe necessarily come
[1:03:19] through the natural heritage of Abraham
[1:03:21] and Isaac but you're a part of that
[1:03:23] third son that Royal seed almighty God
[1:03:26] you're a seed of Christ because by one
[1:03:28] Spirit you've been baptized into one
[1:03:30] body it said Not seeds as many but seed
[1:03:32] which is one it's Christ seed it's the
[1:03:35] Royal seed it's the free seed you're
[1:03:38] free from the bondage of this world
[1:03:40] you're not a part of the church you're
[1:03:41] under a different Covenant that's why
[1:03:43] the Rapture is only for the bride it's
[1:03:46] not for the church you got to recognize
[1:03:48] who you are in the scripture what
[1:03:50] belongs to you if you want to recognize
[1:03:52] your true Freedom you must know know who
[1:03:54] you are not just talking about the
[1:03:56] freedom of the church not just talking
[1:03:58] about the freedom of the world this
[1:04:00] Freedom belongs specifically to the
[1:04:02] bride and so you must know who you are
[1:04:04] what you're in a of what promises you're
[1:04:06] under what Covenant you under it's a
[1:04:08] Grace Covenant and God only recognized
[1:04:11] the token Covenant people there's no
[1:04:14] comparison brother BR said there's no
[1:04:16] comparison in them at all and there's
[1:04:18] always a clash with that spiritual and
[1:04:21] that natural you see those two Vines go
[1:04:23] down through scripture there's always
[1:04:24] been a class brother Caleb there's been
[1:04:26] a class with Cain and Abel with Jacob
[1:04:29] and Esau and Joseph and his brother
[1:04:32] because because they were his half
[1:04:34] Brethren they weren't they they they
[1:04:36] they persecuted him because he was
[1:04:37] spiritual because he could see visions
[1:04:39] and dream dreams what was it brother
[1:04:42] wend was little petty jealousies got up
[1:04:44] and they persecuted him because he was a
[1:04:46] little bit more spiritual and they just
[1:04:48] couldn't handle that and so that natural
[1:04:50] Church always persecutes that spiritual
[1:04:53] church and you must know whose side
[1:04:56] you're on and what your types are for
[1:04:59] Eve is not your type but Eve is a type
[1:05:02] of the natural church that's why they
[1:05:04] that's why that's why they they you know
[1:05:07] they don't just take every word but but
[1:05:09] but but because eel it's a type of this
[1:05:12] natural church that that goes into
[1:05:14] Creeds and different things but it's not
[1:05:16] your type but the thing is they cannot
[1:05:19] beat their type because that's who they
[1:05:20] are and they can't beat their type
[1:05:22] because Eve is their type so if you
[1:05:24] realize who you are and what your type
[1:05:27] is then you can rest assured knowing
[1:05:28] that you cannot beat your type and Eve
[1:05:31] is not my type but brother wend Enoch is
[1:05:33] my Tye and Abraham ties me and rahab's
[1:05:36] my Tye and I can look through that
[1:05:38] scripture through the strain of Almighty
[1:05:41] God's seed and realize what God did
[1:05:42] through them brother Colby and I realize
[1:05:45] that's my type and mean that's the air
[1:05:47] that's the Covenant I'm under amen come
[1:05:50] out from amongst it and be separate
[1:05:53] touch not the unclean thing and I will
[1:05:54] receive you brother brand said I'm a
[1:05:57] segregationist I don't think anyone
[1:05:59] taught Fellowship better than brother
[1:06:01] brandham but brother Bram said I'm a
[1:06:03] segregationist he said you cannot be a
[1:06:05] Christian and be an
[1:06:07] integrationist now I don't know if I
[1:06:09] found the exact right definition but I
[1:06:10] found a definition of that it says to
[1:06:12] bring together or incorporate Parts into
[1:06:14] a whole to make up combine or complete
[1:06:18] to produce a whole or a larger unit as
[1:06:20] parts do and brother bam said you cannot
[1:06:22] be that and be a Christian he said I'm a
[1:06:25] segregationist he said not like slavery
[1:06:28] not like this the segregation of slavery
[1:06:30] where man rules over man he said but
[1:06:32] there is a segregation the bride of
[1:06:35] Christ is segregated from the rest of
[1:06:37] the churches you're a segregated people
[1:06:39] you're separate people you're not meant
[1:06:41] to mix with this world you're not meant
[1:06:43] to mix with the church in fact brother
[1:06:45] Brandon would would preach the invisible
[1:06:47] Union and he would illustrate it as law
[1:06:49] and Grace being marriage and divorce he
[1:06:52] said you're you cannot be married to
[1:06:54] both but that old husband has to be dead
[1:06:57] divorced buried you cannot have both you
[1:07:00] cannot be under but in fact you are the
[1:07:02] elect lady you are misg grac you come
[1:07:05] under a different Covenant and you're a
[1:07:07] free people you're a born people and
[1:07:10] you're a segregated people we've been
[1:07:12] called out of that to come into this
[1:07:15] message to come into Christ the fullness
[1:07:18] of this word it's not a false Unity
[1:07:20] brother Josh as brother Brandon would
[1:07:22] say they say in the m mude of counselors
[1:07:24] there is safety but he said it matters
[1:07:26] who you're counseling with he said Ahab
[1:07:30] that that proved to be a lie to the
[1:07:31] story of Ahab because they had 400
[1:07:34] different ones that they sought counsel
[1:07:36] with and they all said to go up you know
[1:07:38] you're going to win but there was a
[1:07:40] Micaiah in the land who who couldn't
[1:07:43] speak that because he was he was a Son
[1:07:45] of God and and I think it was Micaiah
[1:07:47] forgive me if I got it wrong but but
[1:07:49] there was a prophet though 400 voices
[1:07:51] the multitude of counselors said go up
[1:07:54] there was a voice in the land that spoke
[1:07:56] differently and me when David was trying
[1:07:58] to to to to bring the ark back to the
[1:08:00] temple and they try to do it through
[1:08:03] through through through counseling with
[1:08:05] with the thousands of captains and the
[1:08:06] host and they counseled and they did it
[1:08:09] the the way the counselors thought they
[1:08:11] should do it they did it the way that
[1:08:13] natural man thought they should do it
[1:08:15] and here there was Nathan in the land a
[1:08:17] Vindicated prophet and brother bam said
[1:08:19] there Vindicated Prophet stood in their
[1:08:21] midst and they never even consulted them
[1:08:24] and an innocent man lost his life
[1:08:26] through the multitude of counsel
[1:08:28] sometimes it may become a false Unity
[1:08:31] though that scripture has a place that
[1:08:33] was not the place for it because they
[1:08:34] didn't even consult the Vindicated
[1:08:36] prophet and you can look out and no
[1:08:39] matter if there's hundreds or thousands
[1:08:41] of different opinions about this word or
[1:08:43] about this message and all the whole
[1:08:45] time there's a Vindicated prophet in our
[1:08:47] midst and you didn't even consult them
[1:08:50] when there's an answer right there and
[1:08:52] when you find this message it's the
[1:08:53] answer no matter what the multitude of
[1:08:55] World Council of churches has to say I
[1:08:58] have found my refuge in this Vindicated
[1:09:01] word I don't need to seek a second
[1:09:03] opinion or a third opinion I found my
[1:09:05] answer about water baptism and the
[1:09:07] godhead and the great Mysteries I found
[1:09:10] it in this word and mean that's the
[1:09:12] unity I believe in a Unity with the word
[1:09:15] a Unity under the shed blood under the
[1:09:17] shed blood there is fellowship this
[1:09:19] bride is in fellowship with her mate
[1:09:22] with the revealed word there's no divis
[1:09:23] ision amongst us for how can two walk
[1:09:26] together lest they be agreed how can you
[1:09:28] walk with someone else's opinion and
[1:09:30] this message you must walk with the word
[1:09:32] God is looking for men and women who
[1:09:34] will be prisoners to this word amen and
[1:09:37] for that matter I can't even walk with
[1:09:40] my own opinion in this message I've got
[1:09:42] to lay it aside every thought that I
[1:09:44] have contrary to this word belongs dead
[1:09:46] and buried it's a lie and it's contrary
[1:09:49] this message alone is my leadership it's
[1:09:52] my Heritage it's my it's my headship
[1:09:55] amen you must forsake every opinion amen
[1:09:58] every man must come God is calling every
[1:10:01] man to
[1:10:03] separation not just those who came out
[1:10:05] of the Baptist Church naturally but you
[1:10:07] may have been born in this message and
[1:10:09] God is calling every man to separation
[1:10:11] you see it might not be a denomination
[1:10:13] naturally but a denominational mentality
[1:10:16] that you carry right in a message church
[1:10:19] God is calling you to separation if it's
[1:10:21] contrary to this word you get under that
[1:10:24] little bit of legalism in your mind and
[1:10:26] the pastor may not even teach it brother
[1:10:28] Brandon didn't teach it but in your mind
[1:10:30] you get under this denominational
[1:10:32] mentality under a legalism or a
[1:10:34] formalism or a fanaticism and you must
[1:10:37] separate from that lay it down if it
[1:10:41] doesn't line up with this word then you
[1:10:43] must separate he said come out from
[1:10:45] among it come out from among and and be
[1:10:49] be born into this message and I will
[1:10:52] receive you amen you see the pilgrims
[1:10:55] had to come out they left their Creeds
[1:10:58] for the anointed word they left their
[1:11:00] Creeds for Religious Freedom and brother
[1:11:02] BR said God has separated us from all
[1:11:05] the dead religions and what did he do he
[1:11:07] opened us a new land a new message for
[1:11:09] this day you see CU I I can just maybe
[1:11:13] imagine that there was some that came
[1:11:14] out brother Wendell out of that land
[1:11:17] into this American land many of them
[1:11:19] were seeking true religious freedom many
[1:11:22] of them were seeking real freedom
[1:11:24] because they were trying to operate
[1:11:26] under that bondage and and it wasn't
[1:11:27] working and so they they responded to
[1:11:30] the call to the poll to come to freedom
[1:11:33] but I just wonder maybe if there was
[1:11:35] some on the boat that maybe just came
[1:11:37] out because their parents came out or or
[1:11:39] just because everyone else was doing it
[1:11:41] and they didn't really come out with
[1:11:42] that same desire but they just came out
[1:11:44] because it was It was kind of cool they
[1:11:47] come a little bit farther than they were
[1:11:49] but they brought their chains over on
[1:11:50] the boat and they brought their chains
[1:11:52] into this new land and they got over
[1:11:54] here and begin to operate under the same
[1:11:56] bondage under the same religious bondage
[1:11:59] and so that's why you cannot bring those
[1:12:01] chains into this message you see the
[1:12:03] Lutheran had to die out to that age to
[1:12:06] be born into the Methodist age the
[1:12:08] Methodist had to die out to be born to
[1:12:10] the Pentecostal age and brother Bram
[1:12:12] said don't bring your denomination over
[1:12:14] in the new message this is the word now
[1:12:17] don't bring those chains over into this
[1:12:19] new message those chains of legalism
[1:12:21] those chains of uh just to believe God
[1:12:24] sent a prophet and you're okay those
[1:12:26] chains of of of false baptism and all
[1:12:28] those chains they don't belong in this
[1:12:30] new message this is our freedom brother
[1:12:32] Josh this is our Liberty brother Austin
[1:12:35] this is not our bondage that's why we
[1:12:37] left those things behind is for freedom
[1:12:40] and for Liberty we didn't leave just to
[1:12:43] just to come into a different building
[1:12:45] you didn't build a new building just so
[1:12:46] you could have a better place just to
[1:12:48] sit but you built a new building so so
[1:12:51] you could you know you have a place
[1:12:52] where you could have have comfort and
[1:12:54] you can be established and we did not
[1:12:56] leave those systems just to come into a
[1:12:58] little bit better place but we left for
[1:13:00] Freedom we left for our Liberty amen and
[1:13:03] those chains don't belong here am mean
[1:13:05] if you want to stay Bound in those
[1:13:07] chains that's okay but this message is
[1:13:09] my Liberty it's my freedom I'm not
[1:13:12] willing to give up my only Liberty for a
[1:13:14] little bit of idea or a little bit of
[1:13:16] opinion I'm not willing to give up my
[1:13:18] only joy and my only freedom for a
[1:13:21] little bit of compromise this is my fre
[1:13:23] Freedom this is my joy this is the the
[1:13:26] very solution to my life amen and none
[1:13:30] no chains belong here amen just that
[1:13:32] chain in your mind that chain that tells
[1:13:35] you you're never going to make it that
[1:13:36] chain that holds you down from really
[1:13:38] worshiping the Lord those complexes that
[1:13:40] hold you down they don't belong in this
[1:13:42] new message this is the word now this is
[1:13:45] the word this is your Liberty those
[1:13:48] complexes those habits they don't belong
[1:13:50] in this message this is your freedom
[1:13:52] you've been called out of those things
[1:13:54] that's why God sent us that we could
[1:13:56] have a liberty we could have a refuge
[1:13:59] and they don't belong here you got to
[1:14:02] lay them aside sir brother Brandon said
[1:14:05] that's why I stepped away from the
[1:14:06] Baptist Church Hallelujah I believe my
[1:14:08] God ought to be worshiped in the power
[1:14:10] and demonstration of the Holy Ghost I
[1:14:12] don't believe in your old cold formal
[1:14:14] Creeds he wants to be loved look at him
[1:14:16] setting over there can't be loved he
[1:14:18] can't be loved because the way he's
[1:14:19] treated you see brother brandom had to
[1:14:21] leave the Baptist Church
[1:14:23] that he could worship God in power and
[1:14:26] demonstration he couldn't stay there he
[1:14:28] had to die out to those things but
[1:14:30] brother Brandon was an elect he knew the
[1:14:33] voice of the shepherd he knew the GU and
[1:14:35] he could follow amen and when that word
[1:14:38] came by his way brother wend when that
[1:14:39] light struck across your path those
[1:14:42] walls fell down because you were a son
[1:14:45] you see part of the Jubilee was that
[1:14:47] anything in a walled City could not be
[1:14:49] free if you if you had something in a
[1:14:51] walled City and you didn't redeem redem
[1:14:53] it back within a year then it couldn't
[1:14:55] go free in the Jubilee and brother
[1:14:57] Brandon would take that and talk about
[1:14:59] denominations that were walled up he
[1:15:01] said and if you're so walled up that you
[1:15:03] know the truth comes by your way and you
[1:15:04] say oh I've heard that before when that
[1:15:06] Jubilee comes it's not for you but
[1:15:09] because you were an elect there was
[1:15:11] something in you looking for that and
[1:15:13] longing for that because you were always
[1:15:15] an eagle though you were in a chicken
[1:15:17] yard th those chicken walls that were
[1:15:19] around you could not hold you because
[1:15:21] soon as that light flashed across your
[1:15:23] path
[1:15:23] that seed came to life and those walls
[1:15:25] fell down and you walked free amen
[1:15:28] because there was a seed something in
[1:15:30] you come out from among them is that if
[1:15:33] there ever was a coming out time it
[1:15:35] ought to be now God has ordained his
[1:15:37] people to act different from the world
[1:15:39] you're not meant to be fit in brother
[1:15:41] Colby it's becoming of you to be
[1:15:43] different it's becoming of you to be a
[1:15:45] separated people amen and if you if you
[1:15:49] reject that you've rejected the very
[1:15:51] thing that made you different if you you
[1:15:53] reject the the the reality of this
[1:15:55] message you rejected the very thing that
[1:15:57] makes you different almighty God that
[1:16:00] reality the moving of the spirit in your
[1:16:02] life that Pillar of Fire that's leading
[1:16:04] this church to the Millennium amen don't

[1:16:27] same he said we are not the same we are
[1:16:30] a separated people holy onto the Lord

[1:16:35] God and he says you're not of them we
[1:16:37] are not the same you're a separated
[1:16:40] people that that that the inheritance
[1:16:42] that belongs to them doesn't belong to
[1:16:44] you you are not HS with the Bond woman
[1:16:46] you're heirs with the free woman and
[1:16:48] when Joshua was leading the children to
[1:16:50] their inheritance he would have to
[1:16:52] command and we going to pass by Esau's
[1:16:54] Mountain but just remember that's not

[1:17:05] side of the Jordan as them you've
[1:17:07] crossed over into your inheritance
[1:17:09] you're always meant to believe this
[1:17:10] message you're always meant for this
[1:17:12] mountain you always meant for the third
[1:17:14] pole and the spoken word and the Rapture
[1:17:17] that was always your inheritance and
[1:17:19] because you were Sons this Jubilee was
[1:17:21] meant for you and it called you out of
[1:17:23] all your Creeds and your Darkness you
[1:17:25] heard the trumpet sound and it called
[1:17:27] your name you heard from your theophany
[1:17:30] when you recognize this message as Eagle

[1:17:34] return to my joy I can return to my
[1:17:37] peace I can return to my inheritance I
[1:17:39] can return to the reality where I know

[1:17:49] blessing it's your land that Esau's
[1:17:52] mountain is not for you don't fuss with
[1:17:54] them don't stop there and take a pit
[1:17:56] stop go on pass them to your land you
[1:17:59] can't help that they can't see it they
[1:18:01] were never meant to see it but blessed
[1:18:03] are your eyes for they see and blessed
[1:18:05] are your ears brother Austin for they
[1:18:07] hear jubile is for the elect it's for
[1:18:11] the sons it's not your
[1:18:13] inheritance but oh to you where the deep
[1:18:17] is calling to the Deep to you where just
[1:18:19] going to church wasn't enough to you
[1:18:21] where just sitting on the and the front
[1:18:23] row wasn't enough it was a deep calling
[1:18:25] I got to get to a reality brother Colby
[1:18:28] is that right there's something that was
[1:18:29] in you since you were a child something
[1:18:31] in you that was different than the rest
[1:18:32] of your friends out in the world it was
[1:18:34] something in you tugging you pulling you
[1:18:37] you were always different that election
[1:18:40] that election in your life proving that
[1:18:42] you were never meant for this chicken
[1:18:43] yard Amen brother Josh you were always
[1:18:45] meant to be a preacher of this message
[1:18:47] brother Wendell you were always meant
[1:18:49] for this message but one day you heard
[1:18:51] that trumpet sound and and because you
[1:18:53] were a son you could return to your
[1:18:55] Jubilee amen we're not meant to we're
[1:18:58] not meant for these things uh it just
[1:19:01] doesn't feel right to be under bondage
[1:19:03] for a Son of God or a daughter of God it
[1:19:05] just doesn't feel right there's
[1:19:06] something about it says there's a better
[1:19:08] way that legalism that tries to creep in
[1:19:12] brother Josh uh it's it's like it's if
[1:19:15] legalism and that those mind battles it
[1:19:18] it feels like an eagle beating its head
[1:19:19] against a cage thinking if I make a
[1:19:21] mistake I'm going to hell if I mess up
[1:19:24] I'm going to hell if my dress is 1 in
[1:19:27] too short or too long I'm going to hell
[1:19:29] under that legalism that that I got to
[1:19:31] do it I've got to I've got to have my
[1:19:32] hair long just to set a rules and
[1:19:34] regulations and not a love it's a cage
[1:19:37] but for an eagle he doesn't belong in
[1:19:39] that cage you're not meant for that cage
[1:19:41] of legalism and brother bandam doesn't
[1:19:44] just keep it just a just a dress length
[1:19:46] but he keeps it to the spiritual even
[1:19:48] dancing and shouting he said there's a
[1:19:50] legalism there that said if I don't
[1:19:52] shout I'm not going to make it if I
[1:19:53] don't speak in tongues and I don't have
[1:19:55] the Holy Ghost it's a legalism but this
[1:19:57] bride has been called out of legalism
[1:20:00] into full Liberty into full adoption
[1:20:03] into full placement in the word for your
[1:20:05] hour because your name were written on
[1:20:07] the last book of life before the
[1:20:09] foundation of the world whether you
[1:20:10] shout or not it doesn't matter if you
[1:20:12] dance or not it doesn't matter you've
[1:20:14] been liberated by almighty God when he
[1:20:17] called you as a son he put your name he
[1:20:20] spoke it with his you're just asur to
[1:20:22] make it as he made it oh because the
[1:20:25] spoken word will not return void but
[1:20:27] when Jesus Christ came and died on that
[1:20:29] cross before the foundation of the world
[1:20:31] he was the lamb slain nothing could stop
[1:20:34] him from dying on that cross and nothing
[1:20:36] can stop you brother Austin who was
[1:20:38] spoken before the foundation of the
[1:20:40] world as an attribute of God and sent
[1:20:42] into this Earth Hallelujah you say I've
[1:20:44] never spoken tongues brother Isaac I
[1:20:46] mean I believe it's available I believe
[1:20:48] you can but even if you don't you don't
[1:20:51] have to lay awake at night wondering if
[1:20:53] you have the Holy Ghost because you
[1:20:54] didn't speak in tongues we've been
[1:20:56] loosed of that this message freed us
[1:20:58] into the reality of the word amen it's
[1:21:01] not resting on that it's the person of
[1:21:03] Jesus Christ that has come into your
[1:21:05] life he dwells inside of you he's your
[1:21:08] guide he's leading you into all truth
[1:21:11] amen but I sure love to dance I sure
[1:21:13] love to shout because I am free I sure
[1:21:16] love it I sure enjoy it Amen brother
[1:21:20] Brandon said if they shout all right if
[1:21:23] they don't all right if they do this all
[1:21:24] right if they don't all right for God
[1:21:25] has already said so it has to come to
[1:21:28] pass amen he said we find out after this
[1:21:31] dis dispensation it lasted on he said
[1:21:34] that LE this this was amazing to me he
[1:21:36] said that legalistic dispensation lasted
[1:21:39] until the Royal seed came but he taken
[1:21:42] all the legalism upon himself and paid
[1:21:44] the price of redemption and God's church
[1:21:46] is back in Grace again not under the law
[1:21:49] and legalism it's under grace and the
[1:21:51] promise of God the true Seed of Abraham
[1:21:54] and mean we don't operate legally we
[1:21:56] didn't come to church tonight legally I
[1:21:58] mean you may have come with sickness
[1:22:00] brother Josh may have had a hobble
[1:22:01] through the door but there's something
[1:22:03] in them it's a love for his Lord It's a
[1:22:05] relationship and mean and maybe you've
[1:22:07] been in that place before I mean I've
[1:22:10] been there as a child I always enjoyed a
[1:22:13] good excuse to miss church I always you
[1:22:15] know if I was a little bit sick and or
[1:22:17] someone if Mom was staying home I'd be a
[1:22:20] good volunteer to stay home but now I'll
[1:22:23] I'll drive across the country just to be
[1:22:24] in a meeting I'll drive I'll drive day
[1:22:27] and night just to go to church something
[1:22:29] changed I broke loose of that cage and I
[1:22:32] found a relationship with my savior and
[1:22:35] now I'm a love slave a love slave to
[1:22:38] this word and me we don't operate under
[1:22:41] legalism brother BR said the he said you
[1:22:44] you come to the legal side he said there
[1:22:46] you come to the legal side again if I
[1:22:47] did this if I did that he said never go
[1:22:49] to the legal side it's negative amen and
[1:22:52] forgive give me if it's too much reading
[1:22:54] but this is so good the positive side is
[1:22:55] what you want and now brother brandom's
[1:22:57] telling us which side to go to and
[1:22:59] that's good enough for me he said never
[1:23:01] go to the legal side he said the
[1:23:02] positive side is what you want it's
[1:23:04] already a finished work Christ died and
[1:23:06] the sin was killed when he died and if
[1:23:09] God for ordained you to eternal life all
[1:23:11] the father has given me will come to me
[1:23:13] there you are can't be lost you're
[1:23:15] secured forever for by one Spirit we're
[1:23:18] baptized into one body and one one
[1:23:20] sacrifice he has perfected forever there
[1:23:21] you are there's no way for us to lose
[1:23:24] correctly now don't it make you feel
[1:23:26] good amen don't it make you feel good he
[1:23:29] said never go to the negative side never
[1:23:31] go to the legal side remember who you
[1:23:34] are amen now I'm not just trying to make
[1:23:36] it so loose this is the freedom of the
[1:23:39] bride and mean this may not apply to the
[1:23:41] church this may not apply to your
[1:23:43] neighbor but for the bride you've been
[1:23:45] loosed from legalism you've been loose
[1:23:48] from formalism and fanaticism you have
[1:23:50] found a way that the light has lit upon
[1:23:53] your path and you're walking in a fully
[1:23:55] revealed
[1:23:56] word Amen brother Brandon would type
[1:23:58] that to Ruth the stages of the church he
[1:24:01] said Ruth worked through the stages of
[1:24:03] legalism trying to find favor with Boaz
[1:24:06] he said like the Methodist you know that
[1:24:08] was built upon works and and even he
[1:24:10] said to the stages of Pentecost that
[1:24:12] that you know you got to do a certain
[1:24:14] thing you got to shout or do a certain
[1:24:15] thing but Ruth came to that place with
[1:24:17] Boaz where he became her Kinsman and she
[1:24:20] was no longer depending upon work to
[1:24:22] find favor but she had reached the favor
[1:24:25] with Boaz and then she could rest Ruth
[1:24:28] could rest and this church is resting
[1:24:30] you're not wondering if you're going to
[1:24:31] go across brother Miguel you're not
[1:24:33] wondering if you're going to make it
[1:24:35] you've worked through those stages and
[1:24:36] now you're resting oh he's your Kinsman
[1:24:40] he's redeemed you you're loosed God sent
[1:24:44] us a message to call us out of that
[1:24:46] confusion God sent us a word amen
[1:24:49] calling from both sides to come out and
[1:24:53] he gave us the spirit of
[1:24:55] Truth John 16:13 it says how be when he
[1:24:58] the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:25:00] guide you into all Truth for he shall
[1:25:02] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[1:25:05] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[1:25:07] will show you things to
[1:25:08] come amen aren't you thankful for a
[1:25:11] spirit of Truth God sent a spirit of
[1:25:14] Truth he didn't just send a message to
[1:25:16] call you out but he gave you a guide he
[1:25:19] gave you something to lead you he didn't
[1:25:21] just leave you hanging on the outside of
[1:25:23] the the denominational cities but he
[1:25:25] gave you a guide to lead you and he said
[1:25:28] what is he leading you into he's leading
[1:25:30] you into truth what is truth it's the
[1:25:33] word and me brother man said for he
[1:25:34] shall speak he shall not speak of
[1:25:36] himself but what he hears will speak
[1:25:38] when he hears he'll speak other words
[1:25:40] he'll be the one that will reveal the
[1:25:42] thing you see that Spirit of Truth is
[1:25:44] the revealer God sent a spirit of Truth
[1:25:46] he did not leave us comfortless brother
[1:25:48] Josh but he sent us a guide in this last
[1:25:51] age uh spirit that could tie all the
[1:25:53] loose ends together of reformers in days
[1:25:56] gone by because there wasn't an open
[1:25:58] word brother Brandon said that explains
[1:26:00] why all the mistakes has been done down
[1:26:02] Through the Ages because the seals were
[1:26:04] not open but he said now that the seals
[1:26:06] are open the spirit of Truth directs us
[1:26:08] to the word there's been a spirit of
[1:26:10] truth that has revealed these great
[1:26:12] mysteries in in the days of the voice of
[1:26:14] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:26:16] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:26:18] finished the spirit of Truth is the
[1:26:20] revealer he's revealed these words words
[1:26:22] he's revealed these truths and brother
[1:26:24] Austin we don't have to question baptism
[1:26:27] and godhead and serpent seed we're not
[1:26:29] wandering around the Wilderness anymore
[1:26:31] the spirit of Truth has revealed it and
[1:26:33] that re that revealed truth brother
[1:26:35] Miguel is what sets us free that's the
[1:26:38] type of Freedom I'm talking about I'm

[1:26:55] confusion God is not the author of
[1:26:57] confusion but God has sent a guide to
[1:27:00] lead you and guide you this is not a
[1:27:01] Revival of feeling free this is a
[1:27:04] Revival of being free you're not just
[1:27:06] feeling free we didn't just come to

[1:27:19] Wayne said in the Bible Conference we

[1:27:36] you've been properly identified by the
[1:27:39] message of the hour properly identified
[1:27:42] by the spirit of
[1:27:43] truth brother Brandon would wander
[1:27:45] through that Wilderness on his honeymoon
[1:27:48] he took his wife up there he he did a
[1:27:51] little little trick a little two and one
[1:27:53] I'm going to take you on my honeymoon
[1:27:55] and combine it with my hunting trip amen
[1:27:58] and I'm going to try to kill us some
[1:27:59] deer so we'll have meat for the winter
[1:28:01] and so he got out there uh meat for the
[1:28:03] year he was trying to kill a deer so he
[1:28:04] left his wife and baby and he went out
[1:28:07] into the woods and here he was just kind
[1:28:09] of thinking of of what a guide he was
[1:28:11] and how he can never get lost and you
[1:28:13] know how how how he could never you know
[1:28:15] he could never end up lost in that
[1:28:17] Wilderness cuz he knew he knew the woods

[1:28:22] walk and he got his deer but all of a
[1:28:23] sudden a storm began to roll in and he
[1:28:25] begin to begin to kind of get a little
[1:28:27] turned around and he begin to see a mark
[1:28:30] and and maybe tried to find his way back
[1:28:32] and then all a sudden he' come back to
[1:28:34] his deer again and there his deer was
[1:28:36] hanging and he come back he did that two
[1:28:38] or three times and he realized that he
[1:28:40] was in what the Indians call the death
[1:28:42] walk uh he wasn't he wasn't getting
[1:28:44] anywhere he was lost and he could try to
[1:28:46] convince himself that he was okay but
[1:28:49] his subconscious just couldn't couldn't
[1:28:51] agree because the subconscious doesn't
[1:28:53] lie he knew he knew he was lost he knew
[1:28:55] he was in a problem he knew he was in a
[1:28:57] real trouble but he just began to hear a
[1:28:59] voice I'm an ever presentent help in the
[1:29:01] time of trouble I'm an everpresent help
[1:29:03] in the time of trouble and he began to
[1:29:04] walk and all of a sudden he got down on
[1:29:06] his knees and began to pray to the Lord
[1:29:09] and repent for thinking that he was a
[1:29:11] hunter for thinking that he was a GU say
[1:29:13] Lord forgive me I need your help I need
[1:29:15] to find my wife I need to find my baby
[1:29:18] and there he got up and he began to walk
[1:29:19] again he said okay I've got to make a
[1:29:21] decision I'm going to go this way but
[1:29:23] all of a sudden a hand took him by the
[1:29:24] shoulder and began to turn him around
[1:29:26] and the fog cleared back and he saw that
[1:29:28] Hurricane Mountain he would have went
[1:29:30] the wrong way but a hand turned him
[1:29:32] around and he began to walk with his
[1:29:33] hands up and he would feel Limbs and
[1:29:36] think it was a wire but it wasn't and he
[1:29:38] said see it couldn't be on certain sound
[1:29:40] that trumpet had to be a certain sound
[1:29:42] but then he found that wire and he
[1:29:44] grabbed a hold of it and he could
[1:29:45] Rejoice because that wire was going to
[1:29:47] take him home it was no longer Waring
[1:29:50] with it it was no longer wandering he
[1:29:52] could Rejoice because he found a hold of
[1:29:54] that absolute and that absolute would
[1:29:56] take him all the way home he found a
[1:29:58] hold of a word that would not fail and I
[1:30:00] think my there in his Humanity brother
[1:30:03] Josh he would have went the wrong way in
[1:30:05] his Humanity he was fixing to go the
[1:30:07] opposite way and a hand turned him
[1:30:09] around and I think my that same hand
[1:30:11] maybe was in the room when he was
[1:30:12] preaching the seals and he said I was
[1:30:14] about to make a huge mistake I was about
[1:30:16] to come out with this what I saw in my
[1:30:19] Humanity I studied the the commentaries
[1:30:21] but I was about to make a huge mistake
[1:30:23] until the Holy Spirit came in the run
[1:30:25] and turned him around you see there was
[1:30:27] a natural man that could get lost but
[1:30:29] there was a spirit of truth that was
[1:30:31] leading them and guiding them that
[1:30:33] wouldn't let him walk the wrong way but
[1:30:35] he preached a message and he set a
[1:30:37] straight in nrow path that a bride could
[1:30:39] come behind it and follow it in all
[1:30:42] truth in the full truth that we have an
[1:30:45] absolute we're not wondering if we're
[1:30:46] going to make it we got a hold of that
[1:30:48] wire brother Wendell and it's taking us
[1:30:50] home it's taking us us all the way to
[1:30:52] the Millennium it's an absolute it's the
[1:30:55] spirit of Truth and it's guiding you
[1:30:57] into all truth and it's giving you a
[1:30:59] freedom of Freedom a
[1:31:02] Liberation you don't have to be in a
[1:31:04] cage anymore the truth has set you free
[1:31:08] the truth has declared who you are it's
[1:31:10] the reveal truth amen you're free and
[1:31:14] I'm free tonight I'm free but what am I
[1:31:16] free to be I'm free to be a prisoner I'm
[1:31:19] free to be a prisoner to this message
[1:31:21] I'm free to be a prisoner to this word
[1:31:23] I'm free you say well if I'm sealed if
[1:31:27] I'm free then I can just go and listen
[1:31:29] to all these other voices I can go on
[1:31:31] these websites I can study the other man
[1:31:33] because I'm I'm free I'm sealed but
[1:31:37] that's not what it's about you're
[1:31:39] getting back into legalism again it's a
[1:31:42] love relationship as brother Brandon
[1:31:44] would say I don't worry about my wife
[1:31:46] when I leave I'm not worried that I I
[1:31:49] can't do something wrong or else she was
[1:31:50] going to do something wrong it's a love
[1:31:52] relationship and I don't just lean on
[1:31:55] this message because I have to it's a
[1:31:57] love relationship I have found the one
[1:32:00] who my soul loves it's the revealed word
[1:32:03] I don't have to listen to any other
[1:32:05] voices I don't desire to go out and
[1:32:07] listen and look at other things I have
[1:32:10] found the one who my soul loves it's the
[1:32:13] word it's an absolute and brother
[1:32:16] Brandon said there's something about an
[1:32:17] absolute it seems like when when when
[1:32:20] people find an absolute that negative
[1:32:21] side just goes away because you have the
[1:32:24] word you you have the positive anden
[1:32:27] you're not wondering or questioning
[1:32:29] you've got an answer and you're led by
[1:32:32] the spirit of Truth amen amen the sons
[1:32:35] and daughters follow it brother Brandon
[1:32:36] would say but you see it says even the
[1:32:39] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:32:42] receive and mean as we read in John it
[1:32:44] said he that is of God heareth God's
[1:32:46] words ye therefore hear them not because
[1:32:49] you are not of God and in 1 John 4 said
[1:32:51] we are of God he that he that knoweth
[1:32:54] God heareth us he that is not of God
[1:32:57] heareth not us hereby we know the spirit
[1:32:59] of truth and the spirit of error you see
[1:33:02] brother brandom in his early Ministry
[1:33:04] taught that the baptism the evidence of
[1:33:05] the Holy Ghost uh uh what would be the
[1:33:08] uh fruits of the spirit and love and
[1:33:10] different things but but he said God
[1:33:12] corrected me in a vision one day and
[1:33:14] showed me that it wasn't just love or it
[1:33:16] wasn't just the fruits of the spirit but
[1:33:18] it was to receive the word for your day
[1:33:20] would be the true genuine evidence of
[1:33:22] the Holy Ghost for for it blew my mind
[1:33:25] but he said the Pharisees had a million
[1:33:28] times more fruits of the spirit than
[1:33:30] Jesus did because they had I knew the
[1:33:33] fruits of the spirit wasn't the evidence
[1:33:35] but but it blew my mind when we said the
[1:33:37] the th those priests and things had a
[1:33:39] million times more fruits of the spirit
[1:33:41] for they were gentle and kind but when
[1:33:43] the word came into the building he he
[1:33:45] broke up the services and he kicked them
[1:33:48] out and he braided whips and that was
[1:33:50] the word and so fruits was just the
[1:33:52] evidence then then then then the the
[1:33:54] Pharisees and the the religious sect
[1:33:56] would have them be but when the word
[1:33:58] came in and me that which had received
[1:34:00] the word amen it it followed obedience
[1:34:03] to this to the to the father amen and
[1:34:06] you see there's a difference between
[1:34:08] just just a human compassion and a
[1:34:11] Divine compassion uh you know just the
[1:34:13] fruits of the spirit might say oh uh
[1:34:16] Don't Preach it so hard you might hurt
[1:34:17] someone's feelings uh be a little
[1:34:19] gentler you got to show love but Divine
[1:34:22] compassion does the will of God Divine
[1:34:25] compassion doesn't compromise with any
[1:34:27] word amen this word brother Brandon said
[1:34:30] the now the word doesn't use any
[1:34:32] compassions it has got to be obeyed stay
[1:34:35] with the word no matter how bad it cuts
[1:34:38] amen but human compassion is different
[1:34:40] but I thank God for men of God like your
[1:34:42] pastor that can get up behind this
[1:34:44] pulpit and preach the word and sometimes
[1:34:46] you may get offended and sometimes you
[1:34:48] may not always understand and thinks
[1:34:50] that he doesn't love you but the reason
[1:34:52] he does love you that's why he does it
[1:34:54] because he's got more than human
[1:34:56] sympathy for you he's got Divine
[1:34:58] compassion for you to do the will of God
[1:35:01] to preach the word of God Amen he's been
[1:35:03] loosed of that halfway religion that
[1:35:06] halfway yoke of bondage into the Liberty
[1:35:10] amen and because that love that love
[1:35:12] will produce correction amen the Bible
[1:35:15] says thy rod and thy staff comfort me
[1:35:18] and brother random say that's the hard
[1:35:19] preaching of the Gospel it come comforts
[1:35:21] you because you know he loves you enough
[1:35:23] to correct you and because you are Sons
[1:35:26] you have the ability to receive it
[1:35:28] you're built to receive that correction
[1:35:30] because it comes from the word amen and
[1:35:33] that's the evidence you see this Jubilee
[1:35:35] is for Sons but the very evidence of the
[1:35:37] Holy Ghost is that you can receive the
[1:35:39] message for your day you're in the word
[1:35:41] all the way and me because you are Sons
[1:35:43] you could hear this message you could
[1:35:45] receive this message and you can't
[1:35:47] separate the spirit from the word
[1:35:49] because the Holy Ghost is the spirit of
[1:35:50] the word so how could you receive the
[1:35:52] spirit of the word and not receive the
[1:35:54] word but when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:35:56] you would receive this message it would
[1:35:59] be an Evidence Onto You amen because
[1:36:02] that Jubilee was for you you recognize
[1:36:05] the sound of that trumpet you recognize
[1:36:07] the sound of this message because it
[1:36:09] wasn't for the bondswoman it wasn't for
[1:36:12] the servants it was for sons and you've
[1:36:14] been marked you see those who those who
[1:36:18] turn down the word they got the all in
[1:36:21] their ear that they could never you they
[1:36:24] they were marked that they can't hear
[1:36:25] the Glorious gospel no more but brother
[1:36:27] BR said when a man when a man turns down
[1:36:29] the gospel truth St Marks and wearing
[1:36:31] his ear he deafens them so he can't hear
[1:36:32] the truth no more but it said uh but but
[1:36:35] but but you can't get away from the mark
[1:36:37] for brother man said God marks his when
[1:36:40] they come God God marks his by
[1:36:42] vindicating his promised word through
[1:36:44] them you've been marked but you've been
[1:36:46] marked by God you've been marked where
[1:36:49] where where these signs shall follow
[1:36:50] them that believe believe and and these
[1:36:52] Greater Works shall you do anden you
[1:36:54] haven't been marked where you can't hear
[1:36:56] that word no more but you've been marked
[1:36:58] where it's manifested through your life
[1:37:00] amen and you cannot be deceived because
[1:37:03] you're a part of the elect why can't you
[1:37:05] be deceived because you are the word you
[1:37:08] are the very word and you cannot be
[1:37:11] deceived
[1:37:13] amen and we see that this is a free
[1:37:16] bride we see that this bride has been
[1:37:20] loosed but to the individual sometimes
[1:37:23] in the message they can be bound and
[1:37:26] Paul taught us that that stand fast
[1:37:29] therefore in the Liberty where with
[1:37:30] Christ hath made us free and be not
[1:37:32] entangled again with the Yoke of bondage
[1:37:35] you see brother brandom someone asked
[1:37:36] him one time said I was married uh to a
[1:37:39] woman and the first marriage was good
[1:37:41] but they were divorced and she'd been
[1:37:42] married again and again and he's
[1:37:44] wondering if if he should return to her
[1:37:47] or or if he's free and brother Bram said
[1:37:50] you are free stay free don't go back
[1:37:52] again no sir she's married somebody else
[1:37:54] stay away from her that's right and
[1:37:57] brother Brandon would would show us in
[1:37:58] the invisible Union that that old nature
[1:38:01] is dead that old law nature is dead that
[1:38:04] old man is dead and when you get the
[1:38:05] Holy Ghost brother Austin and you know
[1:38:08] that you met God on those sacred Sands
[1:38:10] and that devil tries to bring that past
[1:38:12] up and tries to get you to go back and
[1:38:14] check that seal go back and check that
[1:38:16] but brother said don't dig him up he's
[1:38:18] dead that old Nature's dead don't try to
[1:38:20] resurrect him he's dead and when God
[1:38:22] fills you with the Holy Ghost and he
[1:38:24] kicks that door shut you're sealed and
[1:38:26] you don't have to go back and keep
[1:38:27] checking that seal he's divorced he's
[1:38:30] dead you're a new creature in Christ and
[1:38:32] do not return again to that yoke of
[1:38:34] bondage do not return again to that yoke
[1:38:37] of halfway do not return again to that
[1:38:39] yoke of partial word we've got full word
[1:38:42] we've got full life and you don't have
[1:38:44] to return to that yoke of bondage it's a
[1:38:47] free Church you're not yolked up with
[1:38:49] anything amen
[1:38:51] sometimes that yoke of fear comes upon
[1:38:53] you and it's a heavy yoke it weighs
[1:38:56] heavy that yoke of fear you wake up
[1:39:00] afraid you go to bed afraid you're
[1:39:03] afraid you're going to miss the Rapture
[1:39:05] you're afraid this message is isn't for
[1:39:07] you you're afraid God doesn't love you
[1:39:10] you're afraid you're going to go to hell
[1:39:12] it's a heavy yoke it's a heavy yoke but
[1:39:15] God has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:39:17] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:39:19] mind and you don't have to give place to
[1:39:21] that devil we've been commanded don't
[1:39:23] give place to that devil you see that
[1:39:25] Devil's trying to get in but but so is
[1:39:27] there a true God trying to get in and
[1:39:30] that devil trying to get in and
[1:39:31] sometimes I think maybe because of our
[1:39:33] Humanity it's so much easier to choose
[1:39:35] the lower route it's so much easier to
[1:39:37] choose the lie because you think that's
[1:39:39] what you deserve you think that's really
[1:39:41] what your future is going to be and so
[1:39:42] you choose the lie and and then all a
[1:39:44] sudden because you were afraid he begins
[1:39:46] to pour condemnation on you because that
[1:39:49] yoke of condemnation I many times
[1:39:51] follows that yoke of fear it seems to me
[1:39:54] that they sometimes paired together
[1:39:56] because you're you're afraid and then
[1:39:58] you're condemned for being afraid you
[1:40:00] think I'm a Christian so I shouldn't
[1:40:01] fear I shouldn't have these mind battles
[1:40:04] and all of a sudden you can't hardly
[1:40:05] pray to the Lord all of a sudden you
[1:40:07] can't hardly talk to them because you
[1:40:08] think my I'm supposed to be a Christian
[1:40:10] but maybe I'm not and that yoke of
[1:40:12] condemnation begins to build and that
[1:40:14] yoke of fear begins to build and so you
[1:40:16] begin to get under this this weight of
[1:40:19] the world is going with you everywhere
[1:40:20] you go a great cloud of Oppression when
[1:40:23] you were always meant to be an eagle you
[1:40:25] were never meant to be in that cage and
[1:40:26] you're carrying that lie around wherever
[1:40:28] you go that nobody loves you that the
[1:40:31] pastor doesn't love you that you're not
[1:40:32] going to make it that the Rapture isn't
[1:40:34] for you because it's so much easier to
[1:40:36] accept the lie but what does the truth
[1:40:38] say about it have you ever looked and
[1:40:40] saw what the word said about it God has
[1:40:42] not given you the spirit of fear and
[1:40:44] brother Miguel there is now no
[1:40:46] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:40:47] Jesus not going to be but you are now in
[1:40:50] Christ you are are now sons and neither
[1:40:52] will there be con condemnation for you
[1:40:54] which have received the re the word
[1:40:56] shall not come into condemnation you've
[1:40:59] already passed from Death onto life
[1:41:01] you've been loosed by the perfect blood
[1:41:03] and because it's a perfect blood it's a
[1:41:05] perfect loosening so why who could
[1:41:08] condemn you who is he that condemneth
[1:41:10] this bride who is he that condemneth
[1:41:12] amen this this Blood Bought Born Again
[1:41:15] bride of Jesus Christ and mean but the
[1:41:17] truth sets you free brother Austin the
[1:41:19] truth declares that you are not under
[1:41:21] condemnation you are not under fear and
[1:41:24] mean and the truth is greater than your
[1:41:25] mind battle the truth is greater than
[1:41:27] your lie the truth sets you free the
[1:41:30] truth declares who you really are your
[1:41:33] identity lays in this word who you were
[1:41:35] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:41:38] that's what I'm talking about I'm
[1:41:40] talking about a freedom that comes from
[1:41:42] this truth amen you don't have to be
[1:41:44] bound in in in in those dark cages uhh
[1:41:49] the devil tries to bring those traps
[1:41:51] they try to get you into some dark
[1:41:53] places but don't give place to the
[1:41:55] devil there was a woman in brother
[1:41:57] Brandon's meetings and uh uh the quote I
[1:41:59] have the quote in there but he said
[1:42:01] there was a burning in her press there
[1:42:02] was a burning he said what is that he
[1:42:04] said that's a devil trying to get in
[1:42:05] there that's a demon trying to get in it
[1:42:08] was a burning sensation and he
[1:42:10] identified it as a demon trying to get
[1:42:11] in and it amazed me because he said
[1:42:13] trying to get in it wasn't in and it
[1:42:16] wasn't just out but it was trying to get
[1:42:17] in but then in another quote he talks
[1:42:20] about the holy ghost moving through the
[1:42:22] building that that that warm filling and
[1:42:25] and just paraphrasing uh but it's there
[1:42:27] he talked about he said that's the Holy
[1:42:28] Ghost trying to get in you see don't
[1:42:30] give place to the devil it matters who
[1:42:33] you let in you got a choice that you
[1:42:35] don't have to you can re resist the
[1:42:37] devil and he'll flee from you and let
[1:42:40] almighty God come in and then you can
[1:42:43] move forward then you can climb into
[1:42:45] your inheritance you see you were always
[1:42:48] meant to be a son but you got caged up
[1:42:51] but you can return at the sound of the
[1:42:53] Jubilee trumpet which declares that you
[1:42:55] are free and because you are a son you
[1:42:57] hear that trumpet and you realize I
[1:42:59] don't have to stay under that yoke of
[1:43:01] fear or
[1:43:03] condemnation you can go from Waring with
[1:43:05] it to
[1:43:07] rejoicing you maybe used to be a slave
[1:43:09] but now that birth changed you from a
[1:43:12] servant to a son the birth made the
[1:43:14] difference and now the devil cannot get
[1:43:17] to you I mean brother Brandon would even
[1:43:19] say since then uh talking about that
[1:43:21] Taskmaster he said he's bluffed me lots
[1:43:23] of times but he's not been able to touch
[1:43:26] me since because he's just a bluff is
[1:43:29] that I can hear his whip cracking and
[1:43:31] popping and so forth but it don't do no
[1:43:34] good because he can't get me amen and
[1:43:37] sometimes we forget that sometimes we
[1:43:39] think that when we become a Christian
[1:43:41] that all that will go away and then you
[1:43:43] hear that whip snap and you gra you go
[1:43:46] right back to that slavery and you think
[1:43:48] that's where you belong but you realize
[1:43:50] that it's different now because now he
[1:43:51] can't get you the Goodman of the house
[1:43:54] is standing at the door and you're
[1:43:55] sealed in and the devil's sealed out and
[1:43:58] you spend so much time waiting for a
[1:44:01] door to close on you you go through
[1:44:03] prayer lines and you're just waiting
[1:44:05] you're just waiting for the preacher to
[1:44:07] tell you that that you're going to hell
[1:44:09] and and discern you and tell you that
[1:44:10] you're full of devils and you're never
[1:44:12] going to make it all your life you're
[1:44:14] walking in condemnation waiting for that
[1:44:16] door to close but it's a lie and you
[1:44:19] don't have to live under that lie Amen
[1:44:21] brother Brandon would say uh we are Sons
[1:44:24] he said because you're born again and
[1:44:25] you let the devil kick you around like a
[1:44:27] football stand on your ground I mean you
[1:44:29] don't have to stay under that amen I
[1:44:32] like this when he said a the devil can
[1:44:34] Hell and Hell can keep me from Raising
[1:44:37] ain't a door he could shut in my face at
[1:44:39] that morning the seals have been broken
[1:44:41] hallelujah amen it was there all the
[1:44:44] time and when you find this message you
[1:44:47] can take off every other garment and put
[1:44:49] on the Garment of of this message
[1:44:51] brother kby you can take off that
[1:44:52] Garment of fear you can take off that
[1:44:54] Garment of condemnation you can take off
[1:44:57] that Garment of of false Doctrine and
[1:44:59] you can put on the Garment of this
[1:45:01] message but you can't be married to two
[1:45:03] at the same time you've got to divorce
[1:45:05] that old garment amen and God has given
[1:45:08] us a liberty he said I'll give you the
[1:45:11] oil of joy for mourning the Garment of
[1:45:13] Praise for the spirit of heaviness I'll
[1:45:15] give you Beauty for Ashes he didn't say
[1:45:18] in addition in addition to I'll give you
[1:45:20] Beauty instead of Ashes I'll give you
[1:45:22] the oil of Joy instead of mourning you
[1:45:25] got to kill that old thing take off that
[1:45:27] Garment of heaviness take off that
[1:45:29] Garment of morning and put on the
[1:45:31] Garment of this message which has given
[1:45:33] you your Liberty amen you can you can
[1:45:37] you see past it you see when you're in a
[1:45:41] situation for me anyway it's so easy to
[1:45:45] walk in the wrong thing and look back
[1:45:47] and think why did I do that hindsight is
[1:45:50] 2 20 as they say it's you can walk in
[1:45:53] fear for so long and then look back and
[1:45:55] say why did I fear and brother Brandon
[1:45:57] say one day on the other side of Eden
[1:45:59] will get back and say why did I fear
[1:46:01] look at the joy I missed but when you're
[1:46:03] in the middle of it sometimes it's hard
[1:46:04] to do that but you got to be able to
[1:46:06] look past it brother Brandon when he
[1:46:09] disobeyed the Lord on his Africa trip
[1:46:12] the Lord is telling him to do a certain
[1:46:14] thing stay in Johannesburg and do a
[1:46:16] certain thing but there was a whole host
[1:46:18] of men persuading them a different way
[1:46:20] and me and he knew what was right he
[1:46:22] knew in fact he he come to the point
[1:46:24] where he grabbed Locust leaves off the
[1:46:25] tree and threw them on their feet and
[1:46:27] said okay but we'll face trouble the
[1:46:29] whole way and they did they went through
[1:46:31] trouble they went through storms and
[1:46:33] situations and and and it was a horrible
[1:46:36] time until brother brandom even
[1:46:37] contracted an amoeba he got so sick he
[1:46:41] couldn't hold meetings he was sick he
[1:46:43] they diagnosed him that that if it got
[1:46:45] to his brain or his heart different
[1:46:46] things that he would be dead within I
[1:46:48] think it was 10 hours and here he was
[1:46:50] was laying on the bed thinking my I've
[1:46:52] disobeyed the Lord Lord would the Lord
[1:46:54] would just turn his back on him wouldn't
[1:46:56] even wouldn't even communicate with him
[1:46:57] like he like he used to think what is of
[1:46:59] my future what is of my meetings what's
[1:47:02] going to happen I disobeyed the Lord
[1:47:04] what's my future going to look like and
[1:47:05] he went through this for long long times
[1:47:08] but one time the Lord visited him in his
[1:47:10] room and he come he said as you've been
[1:47:13] thinking on this about your future and
[1:47:15] he took that stack of look like
[1:47:16] typewriter paper and threw it up he said
[1:47:19] your future is clear here here he was
[1:47:22] brother brand and then he visited him
[1:47:24] five times in one setting said he
[1:47:25] usually only come once but here he come
[1:47:27] five times which to me I thought it was
[1:47:29] a pretty significant number but he said
[1:47:31] your future is clear and that am meba
[1:47:34] will be gone and he began to discuss him
[1:47:36] about his meetings and different things
[1:47:38] but but there was a God he was a prophet
[1:47:40] that disobeyed the Lord he' walked in
[1:47:42] the permissive will but the Lord would
[1:47:44] not take his life but there was a Grace
[1:47:46] that said your future is clear and I I I
[1:47:49] just think of my brother Brandon talks
[1:47:51] about Sarah as we begin to close he said
[1:47:53] remember when Sarah first heard that man
[1:47:58] which she is a type of the church when
[1:47:59] she heard that scene that take place to
[1:48:01] Abraham she actually laughed about it in
[1:48:03] her heart and she disbelieved and
[1:48:06] doubted it ever being so is that right
[1:48:09] at that time God would have rubbed her
[1:48:11] name off is that right but he couldn't
[1:48:14] she's part of Abraham they're one and he
[1:48:16] said and if you've really not been
[1:48:18] excited not worked up in Emotion not got
[1:48:22] some church Creed but really receive the
[1:48:24] Holy Ghost and you're really part of
[1:48:26] Christ and still a little skeptic in
[1:48:28] your mind God will not shove you off
[1:48:31] from that because he can't you're a part
[1:48:33] of Christ he will bring you to the truth
[1:48:36] my what a Grace Sarah should have been
[1:48:40] rubbed off I mean she should have died
[1:48:42] under that law but there was another
[1:48:45] Covenant she was part of Abraham and
[1:48:48] almighty God could see farther than that
[1:48:50] he could see farther than her mistakes
[1:48:52] and see I'm going to bring forth my seed
[1:48:55] to her womb I'm going to bring forth my
[1:48:57] seed in God look at you before the
[1:48:59] foundation of the world he saw your
[1:49:01] weaknesses he saw your mistakes he saw
[1:49:04] your failures and your faults but he
[1:49:06] still chose you why did he choose you he
[1:49:08] could look farther he had the ability to
[1:49:10] look past he had the ability to see past
[1:49:13] mistakes and failures and see but
[1:49:15] they'll have a desire for this message
[1:49:17] they'll have a desire for a jubilee have
[1:49:20] a desire to fly amongst the Eagles and
[1:49:22] so I look past that I'll look farther
[1:49:25] than that and I'll put their names on
[1:49:26] the LSB of life and call them to be a
[1:49:29] part of this inheritance call them to be
[1:49:31] a part of this Jubilee maybe you didn't
[1:49:33] even always know if this message was
[1:49:34] right maybe there's been times where you
[1:49:36] said things that you should have never
[1:49:38] said but because you were a part of
[1:49:40] Abraham because you were a part of
[1:49:42] almighty God he could look farther than
[1:49:44] that and the Grace Covenant could keep
[1:49:46] you when the many have walked away from
[1:49:48] this message many fell way to disbelief
[1:49:51] why are you still here because there was
[1:49:53] a hand on your life that could look
[1:49:55] farther than your mistakes farther than
[1:49:57] your questions and plant a seed in your
[1:49:59] life God got to you brother Josh before
[1:50:02] that lying Spirit could ever get to you
[1:50:04] and he predestinated you and your
[1:50:06] spiritual womb was already sealed before
[1:50:08] the foundation of the world and he slit
[1:50:10] that wedding band of unmerited
[1:50:11] predestinated Grace on your finger and
[1:50:14] you cannot fall away because you're a
[1:50:16] part of Abraham I'm thankful for a
[1:50:19] prophet that could see farther he could
[1:50:21] get above the clouds he said I can see
[1:50:23] where denominations are going I can see
[1:50:25] where the bride is going I can see I can
[1:50:28] see because he was a prophet he was an
[1:50:30] eagle he was a Seer and he could even go
[1:50:33] so far beyond the curtain of time that
[1:50:35] he could see 90-year-old converts were
[1:50:38] young again his horse Prince was there
[1:50:41] his dog Fritz was there as the musicians
[1:50:44] come he could see farther he was always
[1:50:46] scared to death because he think my I'm
[1:50:48] just going to be a spirit floating out
[1:50:50] and that was only as far as he could see
[1:50:52] for quite some time but one day the Lord
[1:50:54] let him see farther than that and said
[1:50:56] you don't want to miss this it's the
[1:50:58] greatest thing everyone's the the same
[1:51:01] age you can go up and hug your sister
[1:51:03] and it's just there's just none of that
[1:51:05] Humanity there it's glorious it's
[1:51:08] glorious don't miss it I'm going to
[1:51:10] fight I'm going to press the battle man
[1:51:12] but don't miss it you say what about my
[1:51:16] future you see there is a hell there is
[1:51:20] a hell for The
[1:51:21] Sinner there is a hell for for the
[1:51:26] wicked but brother Brandon said but he
[1:51:29] said the wicked shall be cast into Hell
[1:51:31] and Hell into the Lake of Fire separated
[1:51:33] from God what a terrible thing that will
[1:51:35] be but with the righteous it shall not
[1:51:38] be so they don't have to fear they have
[1:51:40] been redeemed by God they are in his
[1:51:43] bosdm they are the Overcomers and who is
[1:51:45] he that overcometh he that believeth
[1:51:47] that Jesus is the Christ why will this
[1:51:49] overcome
[1:51:50] this believer escape and go into the
[1:51:52] Realms of eternal life and Bliss because
[1:51:55] Jesus paid a price to Ransom us from sin
[1:51:57] he filled the gap of Separation we who
[1:51:59] which are far off are now made nigh by
[1:52:01] the blood and will never come into
[1:52:03] condemnation they will never be in that
[1:52:05] Lake of Fire they can never be lost for
[1:52:08] he will he will lose none of them
[1:52:10] brother Caleb not one of the redeemed
[1:52:12] will be anywhere except Jesus where
[1:52:14] Jesus
[1:52:15] is they say what's my future as a bride
[1:52:18] brother Isaac your future is clear your
[1:52:21] future is wherever Jesus is there I will
[1:52:24] be also why because this Spirit of Truth
[1:52:27] was a God and he didn't just reveal
[1:52:30] these Mysteries but he showed us things
[1:52:32] to come he said if I go and prepare a
[1:52:35] place for you I will come again and
[1:52:36] receive you onto myself that where I am
[1:52:38] there you may be also he said when Jesus
[1:52:41] prayed brother Bram said Jesus only
[1:52:42] asked for one thing and his prayer to us
[1:52:44] the father you know what that was he
[1:52:46] said that where I am they may be also he
[1:52:50] asked for our fellowship and he's gone
[1:52:52] to prepare a place for us he's gone to
[1:52:55] prepare a place where the River of Life
[1:52:56] flows through the homes amen where the
[1:52:59] tree of life is planted in every yard
[1:53:02] what is it the spirit of Truth has told
[1:53:04] us of things to come and he's declared
[1:53:06] onto us that oh little pride you're free
[1:53:10] indeed this is your future you're you're
[1:53:13] going through a hard time now you may be
[1:53:15] in a battle now you may be facing
[1:53:17] sickness now but I can see farther than
[1:53:19] that
[1:53:20] there's a future home there's a
[1:53:22] millennium but now can you see farther
[1:53:25] than that can you lay down your natural
[1:53:28] eyesight and look through the the the
[1:53:31] the the film of this message and see who
[1:53:34] you
[1:53:35] are one time the sister had a dream she
[1:53:38] had a dream that she was walking in
[1:53:40] White Sands but there was black clouds
[1:53:42] all over her and and she said my sent
[1:53:45] him into a nervousness what's wrong
[1:53:47] what's wrong and I think it was about a
[1:53:48] year her and some some of her family
[1:53:50] even were under this nervousness and
[1:53:52] brother brandom began to talk to her he
[1:53:54] said no sister the white sand show that
[1:53:58] you're walking in Purity and
[1:54:00] righteousness it's just black
[1:54:02] clouds it's just the nervousness that
[1:54:05] took a hold of you it's a lie but the
[1:54:08] true stuff sets you free you see from
[1:54:10] that moment she would never have to walk
[1:54:11] under it again and how long are you
[1:54:14] going to walk under a lie brother
[1:54:16] Brandon would come in contact with
[1:54:18] people all the time thinking they had
[1:54:19] send away the day of Grace and all he
[1:54:20] would have to do is say no the very fact
[1:54:23] that you're you're hunger and shows that
[1:54:24] you haven't and they could walk under a
[1:54:27] lie for so long but there come a time
[1:54:29] where they come in contact with that
[1:54:31] Spirit of Truth and it set them free
[1:54:34] it's the truth that set you free amen
[1:54:37] and and my heart maybe there's a that
[1:54:42] that an eagle in a cage breaks my heart
[1:54:45] to be in a cage of confusion and to know
[1:54:48] I I've been there a little bit knowing
[1:54:51] thinking you know the bride is free and
[1:54:54] I I want to be a part of it so bad I
[1:54:57] want to be a part of this Rapture so bad
[1:54:59] I want to be a part of this Millennium
[1:55:00] and future home so bad I know it's real
[1:55:03] I know it's real but but is it for me I
[1:55:05] just don't know do I have the Holy Ghost
[1:55:08] am I going to make it you living in a
[1:55:11] cage of
[1:55:12] confusion amen but I I know amen that
[1:55:16] God is not the author of confusion you
[1:55:18] don't have to be confused conf used
[1:55:19] about this message you don't have to be
[1:55:21] confused on whether or not you have the
[1:55:23] Holy Ghost there is a guide there is a
[1:55:26] spirit of truth that can show you he can
[1:55:29] lead you into the truth you can know
[1:55:31] that you know that you know that you're
