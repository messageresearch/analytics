and and I mean that brother Caleb we we really appreciate brother Caleb amen let's look here in in 1 Corinthians the first chapter and uh and we appreciate you a whole bunch sister Hannah amen but our sound man is you know it hey sound sound man have it hard you know and uh but we we appreciate U brother Caleb just appreciate everyone tonight and um I I'm sorry that I wasn't able to make it to the fellowship today um sometimes it's just best to sort of uh uh stay before the Lord and get prepared for the evening service and amen but i' I'd like to read here in in 1 Corinthians uh the first chapter and we're going to start at the 17th verse for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel El not with the wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect now that's that's a mouthful right there he sent me to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect but the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto them which are saved it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew him not it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that pre that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called someone say hallelujah hallelujah both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want want to thank you for your love tonight and I'm so thankful that I came to the well I'm so thankful that the holy spirit is ever here on this Earth as long as this bride is here Lord your spirit is here to lead us and to guide us and Lord you're still with us in in this hour of Darkness of that we're living in but I'm so glad for your light I pray holy spirit that you would just be with us here tonight that you would minister to our hearts Lord that we would you would help me to just get out of the way and let your word have the preeminence tonight I sure love you Lord and I love these people I'm so thankful Lord that you've called me in this day to to just be an echo of of what as all already come to us in the revelation of the hour Lord we have no message to preach than yours but God what a message you've given us I pray Lord that you would always cause a hunger in our hearts a deep down desire Lord to love you more to know you more to have a deeper relationship with you oh God we want to go home we want to be with you father that's our desire and we're clinging to that promise now Lord we love you with all of our heart in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this evening I amen want to continue maybe my thought a little bit on the preacher amen and and tonight but building a platform for Jesus Christ so as we ministered this morning God is still calling and commissioning preachers but we are not to confuse these men with the intellectually gifted men amen because these a preacher is not a sermon maker a preacher is not one who has the wonderful ability of connecting dots and amen between the scriptures and the quotes these men are not lecturers these men amen are not one that can just lay it all out in a seminar fashion maybe but these men are set aside under the power of the holy spirit amen to represent Christ and the message of the hour to the people amen these men again are not just ones that bring that that that open a Bible and and teach it any man or woman boy or girl can look into the Bible and and and can see those things but the gospel brother Bram would put it this way he says now in the day that we can't expect the gospel of Christ to be popular he says the gospel this talking about the word is is not the gospel this is part of the gospel Paul said the gospel came not in word only but through the power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost is that right so the gospel is not the word only the word's just a dead letter it's got to take the letter quickened and made alive and brought to pass what the letter said says it'll do that's the gospel he didn't say go to the uh go teach the word he said go preach the word go preach the gospel the word is the beginning or the Forerunner of the Gospel the word goes out and the gospel of the power of the demonstration of God follows that word makes the word manifest making it the gospel amen so we we we we are not the the Old Testament had the dead L but you see Jesus found in his body the quickening of what the Old Testament had said so Jesus himself found that he was the word made manifest and that's what we ultimately are as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen can you say Amen so we are not teaching you amen a a a a a Cod of of Ethics amen by uh that brother brandham gave us to give he we we brother brandham came to bring the word to light and so should every minister of the message of this hour can you say Amen now Amen brother brandham would teach us that every uh uh truly anointed uh a a preacher is a prophesier amen a fourth tell teller of the written prophecy a and that the original anointing is upon that original prophecy and if it is preached Amen in the fullness of its original conception under the anointing of the Holy Spirit it will manifest every promise that God said it would do amen now that that that's a blessing for us ministers that is something that is a promise that has been given to us amen now us ministers feel very inadequate and we are very inadequate I feel like I'm one of the most inadequate uh men to ever stand behind a Pulpit I'm sure that every one of you ministers feel the same way uh just as you mamas and daddies and we all feel like we're in adequate but the thing is we are anointed to preach the gospel and the words if we stay with the message God will vindicate it and bring those promises to pass well praise the Lord now brother bradam and souls that are in prison he says he uses men that's true he does nothing outside of what he does by man we realize that that's his agent that's what he chose that why I don't know he could have chose the sun to preach the gospel he could have chose the wind to preach the gospel he could have made the wind to do things but he chose man that was his idea that human would speak back through human not himself but the word of God come to the prophets the prophesied the original word how can it be a true prophet he can't be because he's denyed the truth of the word and then if it doesn't well then this word itself as it is preached by the tress of the word and by the tress of the Holy Spirit it'll manifest every promise that it promised and that's how we know whether it's right or not that's what Jesus said if I do not that which is written of me to do then don't believe me can you say Amen so so the awesome privilege of of us ministers and I'm just going to talk to you ministers for a for a few moments before we uh go back to the congregation is we've got this privilege of bringing Christ to the people through his word right that's the reason why amen that's the reason why we're not out at McDonald's until uh 5 minutes before 7 and then come in and amen and and um uh uh and and picking our Bible up and going out and preaching no amen we've got to be Anointed with the same anointing that wrote the book so that we can preach the word now brother amen we listen we don't want to even waste the people's time being up here uh uh just just reading some quotes and some scripture verses and not have no anointing Upon Our Lives amen we want the anointing of the Holy Spirit to come upon us and Quicken it now that you know that does that necessarily mean that you're uh uh that that the preacher is going to be dancing or does that mean that we all have to have a certain style or we all have to have amen God's got a five-fold Ministry and that five-fold Ministry amen I I sure hope no one preaches like I do hallelujah amen you you we don't we're not trying to copy one another we're trying to bring Jesus Christ to the people amen right so it's not be trying to uh uh uh preach like like like brother John or brother William but it's but it's the anointing I've got to be anointed for this cause that I'm here for can you say Amen so what am I to do my words are to preach and bring uh uh uh a point the people to nothing but Jesus Christ and what am I doing as a minister I am building the faith of the people and faith comes by the hearing of the word amen the Holy Spirit now brother Brandon would would say this in Messiah he says that's the thing that delivers the word the word goes out and the Holy Spirit follows the word wherever the word is preached you see your pastor preach it and the first thing you know is across the building goes the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost see that's right it's the conductor of the word the word word is the conductor of the spirit because where the word is preached the spirit follows wherever it goes why the spirit follows the word can I hear an amen amen oh I like that he says I like sound Bible teaching and the Bible holy ghost coming back confirming that Bible teaching if the Holy Ghost doesn't confirm it then you've got your wires crossed you've got a ground somewhere amen yes sir if you can get get the word hooked up to the Dynamo that great thing that puts out the fullness of the current he'll just set that little wire on fire for you that's right and it'll do things for you well praise the name of the Lord amen so building faith there is nobody that can build your faith like the preacher yes sir now people don't want that they don't want to hear that we're in a day where preachers are being dismissed and it's sad to say it's even it's a lot it's it's happening a little bit in the message but it's definitely happening around the world it's happening around the world until the the the church the preachers the nothing has has no effect but if but that is God's design for the church did you know there in in in in in HEB or in Ephesians the 4th chapter he says he's given gifts unto men he's given that five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of their Ministry until we all come into the knowledge of the Son of God Amen he says he's given that five-fold Ministry to do that and in order to bring that church into a rapturing condition we've got to be anointed right and it's not just us under the anointing the church has got to be anointed and there's where we go Lord amen there's where there's where the preacher is important to be under the anointing of the Holy Spirit not under the anointing of a man not under the anointing of a pastor not under the anointing of another amen someone down the road but under the anointing of the Holy Ghost bringing that word to life can you say amen Amen brother brenon would say Christ is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the word was made flesh and dwelt among us then the word then the anointing the oil represents the Holy Ghost she took the holy spirit it's the word and the truth amen Jesus said the times coming to the woman at the well that God will honor those who worship Him in spirit and Truth many people worship in spirit and not in truth many Worship in truth and not in spirit but when you get them together then you've got some when the Holy when the spirit of God gets into the word she mixed it together and when you get the spirit of God on you mixed with the word something is going to happen hallelujah oh God don't let me just be a hearer of the word but let the anointing come upon me right well praise the Lord you know I think we need to teach our children amen how to get in to the services it's important that they not just sit and listen amen but with but set and listen with a expectation I think I think when we come to church we should expect the supernatural I think when we go to prayer we should expect God to answer our prayer I think the church should be living under a faith of the for the supernatural in their lives Amen brother brother Bram says he goes on he says the doctor might sent you home to die with a Cancer and all the man knows he's done everything he he knows in his knowledge of the books of learning to save your life he wants to see you live but maybe he just don't know no more amen but you take God's word tonight and you mix it with the spirit of faith and watch what'll take place can you say amen and you see that that's the privilege of the preacher because the preacher has been given a promise that if he preaches thus sayth the Lord the anointing of the Holy Ghost will come and back that word up right well why would you want to preach anything else why why why would you want to preach something TD jakes's God or something that that someone else has God when you've got the anointed word why would you want anything else amen oh can you say Amen oh when you get the people in the presence of God Amen then things happen when you get the people in the presence of God attitudes change when you get the people in the presence of God amen oh All Things become possible brother BR I'm talking about jarus was he was the secret believer and he was so scared and so scared but once he got into the presence of Jesus then all of everything left him behind brother Brandon would say and Jesus going with little jarus down to his sick daughter he says now they're they're going along I can see jarus walking along now all the priests looking at him and said H that's that's what you choose amen yep that is it he says uh walking right along he got close to Jesus he had a a a change of heart every man that really gets close to Jesus can never be the same anymore no you can't associate with the old dry formal religions anymore you've got something in you that changes you that makes you different if you ever come close amen you can go you can go close to church and do anything but you can't come close to Jesus and be the same anymore amen I I say tonight amen if Jesus follows the word then let us preach that word every time the word is preached the anointing follows every come on church amen I should say amen God don't let the don't let it just be the preacher in in his in his room of fasting and praying and calling out to God before uh before a church but God let me spend some time alone let me clear my heart and say God God left the anointing amen just as jerus I've got a daughter that's dying I need the supernatural I need the power of God I need to hear what the preacher has to say I need the anointing to come upon that word and quick in life unto me right can you say Amen yes sir amen he got close to Jesus and then everything changed now you can see the authority brother R says don't you see the authority of the Living God in the Living Church the bride the sick are healed the dead are raised up the crippled walk the blind see the gospel Goes Forth in its power for the message and the messenger are the same the word is in the church in the person now now that that that would have been a real good time for y'all to jump up and Shout I going to read it again don't you see the authority of the Living God in the Living Church the bride sick or heal dead or raised crippled walk blind see the gospel Goes Forth in its power because the message and the messenger are the same the word is in the church in the person oh God where we're no longer just believing a word but now those who preach that word those who believe that word it ain't just preaching behind the pulpit the anointing follows the word that the preacher is preached the anointing doesn't stay upon the preacher it comes well praise the Lord amen so what is the preacher's job what is what is our job amen as as a preacher to the congregation the preacher's job is to bring Jesus Christ to this congregation it's to present the word of God to you so tangible that you want that you can see it that you want it and that you're willing to do whatever it takes can you say amen Amen brother brother brandham amen he he gives his and I I've got a few of these quotes here amen he he he says he says I have one thing I'm here building a platform for one person who's the candidate and that's Jesus Christ and him alone I give my time for him that's right if I can get the church straightened out and the rest of the world will take care of itself that's right can you say Amen now brother Brandon wasn't building a platform amen for another messenger he wasn't building a platform for another man he wasn't building a platform for himself he wasn't building a platform but he was building one platform and that was for Jesus Christ every time he preached he was building a platform for Jesus Christ to come down and be made manifest to that congregation right every time he preached that's why people came and sought after him because he had one desire and that's to bring Jesus Christ real to that congregation amen right right man what it takes to overcome all unbelief he says now we've come here tonight to elect a man that man is the Lord Jesus and I'm trying to build a platform for him tonight that in the coming nights of this campaign we might rejoice and praise His name because we have elected him in our hearts to be our savior Our God our healer and first we've got to place a platform for him right well I tell you what that that when I read that that made me want to shout you see my job is not to heal the sick raise the dead or any part to perform my job is to introduce Jesus Christ right amen well praise the Lord amen another place he says amen he says he says we're in a world that has been weaned away from those things but we're building a platform tonight for a man he man amen as as the woman said at the well come see a man who told me the things that I've done isn't this the very Messiah come see the man the man that we're building on tonight the Lord Jesus Christ upon him for upon all other grounds of sinking sound all other grounds will perish but that rock Christ Jesus will stand forever do you see what brother brandom's desire was is to get the people to Jesus Christ another one he says our heavenly father on the basis of Thy word upon the basis of thy shed blood and on on thy vicarious sufferings that Calvary thy triumph over death over hell and the grave over Satan all the works of Satan from sin to its uh uh uh to all its attributes to sickness and disappointments to nervous frustrations and all the gloomy weariness wearies that goes with it all doubts and things we build your platform here tonight for your beloved Son the Lord Jesus we elected him uh uh uh we elected him Lord for this campaign and we're happy Lord there's no other one we want we want no one but Jesus we love him we believe him with our all our heart we've elected him as our savior no other savior there's no other Church no Creed no denomination no Pastor no Pope no Priest No Rabbi there's nothing can save us outside of the blood of your son Jesus he's our savior we love him we know that Divine Healing is yours it belongs to you for we read in Psalms 103 and3 I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases therefore Lord we commit our case you're our physician you're our great physician and we're here tonight your believing children obeying your word by putting their hands on one another hear from minister from the minister all the way to the leoty everyone pastors evangelist and and their hands all on one another Housewives children all the hands together because they believe this one that we all elected our Lord is our healer amen oh hallelujah oh don't you just love him tonight now so our job as the ministry is to do our best to to bring Christ real to the people and it's so important that the church not just look at us as Wendall or amen as as uh another Minister but you can see and hear you can see the gift of God and pull on that gift and bring that anointing from off the preacher on to amen the you as the believer can you say amen amen amen so that's what God's design was that's what brother bram's desire was brother bram's total desire was to see Jesus living in a reality in the people living in a reality well can you say amen he says he says all you should see is just have to see it's just one vision and the Lord proving that he's here and then the rest of you should be able to know that he's here and that you can receive your healing he says he shouldn't you shouldn't have to see uh uh discernment after discernment after discernment after discernment he said you should just know that he's here I'm trying to introduce him to you so that you can take what you have need of tonight oh isn't that just wonderful oh your answer your answer isn't waiting down the road your answer is right here God sends preachers to you that'll bring the anointing down and say listen he's here he's here he loves you he's got a word for you he's got what it takes and the anointing follows that word hallelujah can you say Amen yes praise the Lord now even when brother brandham was you know when he was wondering if he was going to be taken away when he when he had the the vision of the of the big blast and he he didn't know if he would if when the seven angels came and he was pondering this could be his going home time and and and he was he was speaking of it a little bit amen and and and he says you know uh he says the other day when I came Westward you you've played the tape many of you I guess and you understand I don't know what I'm waiting I I'm here now I I don't know why I'm just waiting it may be my going home time it looks very much that way if it is there will rise somebody after me that'll take the message on he'll be an odd person but he'll rise after this and take the message on and you listen to it as long as it's scripture stay with it right and if this isn't it if it is isn't then there is coming another portion now for I do believe that we're living in the last days and I'm thankful that I have lived in this day I wouldn't trade this day for no day this is the most glorious day that's ever been on the earth and we understand it was not his going home time it was the it was the revealing of the word to you and me can you say amen amen and brother brandham says now his job was to introduce Jesus to the world right Hallelujah his job was not to introduce another church age his job was not to uh uh uh uh bring on another organization his job was to bring Jesus clearly can you say amen amen he says now I want to say this this is this is after the seals he says I now I I've never said it before but according through the scripture according to what he said 30 years years ago 33 years ago down on the river 1933 rather he said everything has happened just exactly what he said everything has happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world right I oh glory to God this I may not do it in other words I might go by the way of the grave but this message will still be living yes this message will still be alive and well in The Bride of the people can you say amen amen hallelujah oh yes amen another place he says I'm only a witness I'm only an electioneer as we have in Louisville now the Democrat Convention of of Kentucky they're building the platform for their man to be elected I'm also building a platform for my Lord won't you receive him tonight as your your own another one he says my mission I believe God has called me for I have to say something personal today because that's what I told you I'd do and tell the world my mission I believe to the Earth is to forrun the coming word the coming word which is Christ Christ in him has the Millennium and everything right there because he is the word what what greater commission yes sir than any other age right to preach this gospel we're in the finality Hallelujah a pro Hallelujah if there's ever a Time us preachers get off the fence amen and really get a hold of God I believe that's the time to do so I believe that there's ever a Time hallelujah hallelujah how many knows mamas you Mamas are preachers you daddies are preachers preachers too amen we all have our place masas are preaching to their children daddies are preaching to their families amen we we've all got our responsibility if there's ever a time to make this thing so real to those that are around us it is if there's ever a time to be excited amen this me I may go in the way of the grave but this message will introduce Jesus Christ amen hallelujah can you say Amen you see men with experience mamas with experience daddies with experience preachers with experience someone that's been with a supernatural God somebody that's experienced amen this Christ that was brought to us in this generation men who know how to believe that word and handle that word and stand against the enemy with that that word right man calls others to take courage to follow that Living Word the intellectual Giants will never do it I'm I'm I'm not going to hold you long I'm fixing the clothes the intellectual Giants will never produce that kind of faith in your life okay come on a man that can sit there and explain and this and that and the other will never produce that kind of a rapturing faith yes sir but that anointing the anointing that is here that comes upon the believer today come on now you masas will never do it but just amen having it all here you've got to experience this resurrected Christ for yourself you daddies will never be able to overcome the enemy with this here do do you understand my what my my purpose in my preaching the last uh uh three services service however long has it's been amen I I it's it's not this it's the reality is being here it's that reality is being here with experience can you say amen hallelujah amen intellectual giants can't a man take any man into battle an intellectual giant can't do that that's right brother brandham teaches us there in in uh uh with David and Saul amen and and he says he says now he says that's Pentecost today it wants to make intellectual Giants it wants to take the power out of the church it wants to make a denomination grow and bring more members that's nonsense when you bind a man to a Creed when you do that you take the holy spirit away from him he'll have to give somewhere the Holy Ghost will move on the man can't uh uh on on account of his Creed and then of course Saul trained his army Oh my he had them Israelites just knowing every which way to knock a spear off or to do anything but one day there come a challenger oh Goliath and brother it taken more than an intellectual training then it took a man that knowed something about the supernatural but God had such a man thank the Lord for that God's always got somebody shout hallelujah hallu he's always had he's had a man he could put his hands upon a little bitty Ruddy old Ruddy fella out there wasn't very much but he come up there and he said you mean to tell me that you'll let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the Army and there was old Saul Head and Shoulders above them all all of his intellectual training didn't do any good now the churches had done that has done that they got away from the Holy Ghost they got away from the power of God they've got away from the leading of the spirit amen we got sons of Kish too we we've just had one of our great Giants the other day over here in Africa it was challenged by a h a muhammadan on the scripture what happened he took water like the rest of the sons of Kish like the other son of Kish too no disregard to our brother but they had a man who know that God could deliver they brought that little David up there and he said I don't know nothing about your Spears or your intellectual training but I know one thing I know one thing I went out after a sheep that was took by the enemy and God let me bring him back he said how much more will he make me uh will he make me let me bring back this uncircumcised Philip Philistine what we need today is men and women who wants a reality and then he shouts Hallelujah who wants a reality not a Creed but a reality that's what the world needs today not Creeds not Fashions we need realities in God the world don't want it the world don't want it they they don't want to accept it but the church has to have it God wants you to have it he's the god of realities yes sir God wants you to have it God wants you boys and girls to have a reality God wants our church to have a reality God wants the supernatural to not just flow from a preacher but he wants the supernatural to flow through you he don't want you to be content with just sitting in a church he don't want you to just be content being a Christian he wants a reality but you got to Crave it are you hearing me amen oh God I'm thankful to be a preacher right now I'm thankful that I can rise up and say it is yours I'm glad God's given me that commission to say he's still alive he's still real He he'll heal he'll deliver he'll save he'll feel he'll do it I know he can do it he's done it through me and in me oh can you say Amen you see you can't stop somebody with an experience you can't talk that experience out and away from that man that's right you can talk somebody with some intellect you can talk them out of it but you'll never talk this message out of me because I found a reality in Jesus Christ and it ain't a bunch of stuff up here amen that's made me uh H you know feel pretty educated no there's a living Christ that I have found I Found Jesus to be alive amen can you say amen amen amen now David he had met God at the beginning it was David that God chose at the beginning and it was God's anointing that he depended upon now it was David that had sep that God had separated Hallelujah God had done the choosing God had separated David and now it was David relying upon the presence of God in his life God had confirmed the commission God had told him I'm with you that's right God says you are a covenant you're a covenant Jew and when he looked over Adam he says Where what what's wrong why are you hiding are we not God's covenant people oh glory to God one preacher standing in the back of the crowd he's the one with all the armor he's the one standing in Head and Shoulders above them all brother pastor's back there in the back but here comes here comes a little old fella well praise the Lord maybe he's just an evangelist I don't know what he was but brother bradam says but he come with a slingshot and he come in and he brought Victory to Israel can you say Amen brother bradam says now you see God had been training him because David's commission was to take care of those sheep and when the anointing oil was upon David then David took his position seriously hallelujah amen here in in another place brother Brenham says he found out that the ecclesiastical vest of salt didn't fit a man of God and so it waited him down and that's what the trouble with a lot of men today is I meet across the land men of great standing in the high churches and Things They believe the message of the Deliverance they believe the message of the Lord Jesus and his power but they're so Shackled down with church denominations till they can't see no further than the church they won't let them any further what we need today is somebody to step out with some experience with a slingshot like David had David said I don't know nothing about your theology I I about these swords and so forth but your servant with the sshot I had an experience out there God let me kill a lion with it and kill a bear with it and if he'll let me kill a lion with it surely that uncircumcised Philistine belongs to me this afternoon and then brother bradam says give us some more Ruddy boys with that kind of Ruddy experience that'll take God at his word and believe him for everything he says is the truth that's what we need tonight dear Christian friends now I want you to notice he went out and proved exactly that God was with him because he had an experience that God could deliver the enemy into his hand by his slingshot oh Hallelujah he had something he could Proclaim he had something that why because he had already met that God he says I let me let let let me stand and testify for a little bit the god that brought the the bear down and the lion down and I brought the Lamb's back is the same God that'll anoint me to defeat that devil hallelujah amen do you love him here this morning this evening oh yes so we stand here tonight I say tonight what a commission what a call what a time for this hour what what is fitting if he can't take the word out of your heart then he'll come in and attack any other way he'll attack the preacher he'll attack this he'll tack that and he has successfully tried to take in many cases successfully tried to separate the supernatural from this message this message was founded on the Supernatural and this message will always be Supernatural the supernatural God vindicates his word I am not William brandham I am wend Martin a bride member of this church and in my name you shall cast out Devils he said I can stand upon that word and believe it can can I hear an amen from you do you see yourself as a bride member do you see yourself written on the Lamb's Book do you see yourself amen that's what the proclamation is you're no longer a slave you are a son of God you are a covenant people with him amen that's the truth praise the Lord the Apostle Paul there in 1 Corinthians 9 and16 it says for though I preach the gospel I have nothing to Glory of for necessity it laid upon me there's a there's a weight on my shoulder I've got a call and none of the beatings can take that call out of me none of my imprisonment can take that call from me necessity is laid upon me Woe Is unto me if I preach not the gospel if the musicians would come Romans 10:13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how shall they call on him in whom they have have not believed how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard else shall they hear without a preacher El shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things I thank God for every one of you men of [Music] God
