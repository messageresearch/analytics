[20:43] Man Came forward and picked up the
[20:48] bow he wiped the dust from the Old
[20:53] Violin and he TI up the Stream
[20:59] then he played out a Melo pure and
[21:04] sweet sweeter than the Angels
[21:09] Sing when the music stopped the
[21:14] auction with a voice that was quiet and
[21:19] low he said now what am I be for the own
[21:24] violin and he held it up with the
[21:31] bow then he cried out one give me 1,000
[21:36] who make it two only

[21:43] three 3,000 twice you know that's a good
[21:48] price come on who's going to be for
[21:53] me and the people cried
[21:56] out what made the
[21:58] change we
[22:00] don't
[22:03] understand and the auction is St and he
[22:07] said with a
[22:09] smile it was the
[22:14] tou of the Master's
[22:20] Hand now you know there's many a man
[22:24] with his life Out Of Tune about it
[22:28] SC with
[22:31] sin and he auctioned him to a thankless
[22:36] World much like that Old
[22:42] Violin but then the master comes and the
[22:47] foolish
[22:48] crowd they never under
[22:53] understand the worth of a soul and the
[22:57] chain that is run just by one
[23:03] tou of the Master's
[23:08] Hand then he cried out one give me 1,000
[23:13] who make it two only
[23:16] 2,000 who make it
[23:20] three 3,000 twice you know that's a good
[23:25] price come on who's going to be on
[23:29] me and the people cried out what made
[23:34] the
[23:35] change we
[23:37] don't
[23:39] understand and the auction is stopped
[23:43] and he said with a
[23:46] smile it was the
[23:50] touch of the Master's
[23:55] Hand then he cried out one give me 1,000
[24:00] who make it two only

[24:30] he said with a
[24:32] smile it was the
[24:37] T of the Master's
[24:40] [Music]
[24:47] [Applause]
[24:50] Hand amen did you enjoy that I've always
[24:54] liked that
[24:55] song There Is No Worth to that by L no
[24:59] value to it until the master touched it
[25:01] and once the master touched it the value
[25:03] shot up you know I think brother brandom
[25:05] says we're worth what 5 cents he says
[25:08] you know many people spend hundreds of
[25:10] dollars on clothes on hats Ono uh coats
[25:13] but it says really we're only worth 5
[25:14] cents but the soul is 5,000 worlds I
[25:18] believe he said so once the master gets
[25:20] a hold of our life it goes from 5 cents
[25:22] to 5,000 worlds and I think my that's
[25:25] what made the change in our life w we W
[25:27] not worthy of our own but God came gave
[25:30] us life you know was born in a manger
[25:31] this Christmas season as we're

[25:37] is to think that God Of Heaven maker of
[25:40] the heavens and the Earth come down and
[25:42] died for us to give us the Peace of

[43:22] be
[43:23] seated I I'm just going to take a
[43:26] thought tonight the
[43:28] Simplicity of God on
[43:31] Earth and
[43:33] [Music]
[43:35] and the Very thought that God would
[43:39] become
[43:41] human amen that's what the story is All
[43:43] About that's what Christmas is
[43:46] God becoming a human
[43:50] being and sometimes we Overlook the real
[43:55] plan the purpose of what God is doing
[43:58] and I I looked at a at a uh as I was
[44:02] back there in the office I when I when I
[44:05] was thinking about the Simplicity of God
[44:07] on Earth i' looked up a quote and I I I
[44:10] want to read this to you and it says You
[44:13] must be reverent with spiritual faith in
[44:15] your heart or God can't do nothing for
[44:18] you the more humbler you get and the
[44:22] less you know about the things of the
[44:25] world the better you are or the better
[44:29] off you are in the sight of God the
[44:32] greatest success I ever had was among
[44:35] people who hardly could read or write
[44:38] but now I'm not trying to support my
[44:40] ignorance or prejudices but I'll say the
[44:43] biggest hindrance that the Gospel of
[44:45] Jesus Christ has ever had has been this
[44:48] modern-day education that's right even
[44:51] in the ministry they've explained
[44:53] everything out of the Bible the blood
[44:54] the days of Miracles the the powers it's
[44:56] all explained out and dear friends don't
[45:00] you know the worldly wisdom is the thing
[45:02] that destroys the world in the Garden of
[45:05] Eden there were two trees and one of
[45:07] them was the tree of life and when man
[45:10] ate from that tree he live forever and
[45:12] the other was the tree of knowledge
[45:15] which was the tree of death which was
[45:16] the tree of sickness he destroyed
[45:19] himself with his gunpowder and his
[45:21] electric lights and his the pull the
[45:23] gases out of the earth wisdom run to and
[45:26] fro knowledge shall increase and they've
[45:29] been they've brought theirself a
[45:31] hydrogen
[45:32] bomb and I don't know what they're going
[45:34] to do automobiles every time a man he
[45:38] God destroys nothing man destroys
[45:40] himself by worldly wisdom the first
[45:42] conflict there ever was in the world was
[45:44] because somebody was seeking after
[45:47] worldly wisdom instead of simple faith
[45:50] in God you say do so and so doesn't
[45:54] believe it that doesn't change the word
[45:56] of God's word a bit remember you're not
[45:59] saved by wisdom you're not saved by
[46:02] education you're saved by faith in Jesus
[46:06] Christ forget about your
[46:09] education be simple in your own
[46:13] Doctrine and I as I as I looked along
[46:16] these lines of the Simplicity of God on
[46:21] Earth the Simplicity that God would come
[46:25] and
[46:26] and and live in a human being the
[46:30] Simplicity that God would want to
[46:35] redeem Mortals
[46:38] humans you and me the simp the the the
[46:42] Simplicity of the thought that God so
[46:45] loved teenagers and God so loved mamas
[46:50] and
[46:51] daddies that that God would create a
[46:54] body and become one of us he would
[46:58] become so one of us that the people did
[47:02] not recognize him when he was
[47:05] here he become so one of us walked among
[47:10] them and they wondered is this not
[47:13] Joseph's son he was so one of us now
[47:18] brother brother bradam would would talk
[47:20] about the the the Eternal sign and and
[47:24] and and and he would say how that this
[47:27] great super sign this this this sign
[47:32] that we just read in the scripture I
[47:34] will give you a sign and he said the
[47:36] sign was told to the Shepherds you will
[47:39] find him in the staple wrapped in
[47:42] swaddling
[47:43] clothes that's the super sign born over
[47:46] a manure pile the stink of the barn with
[47:49] not even clothes to put on him Emmanuel
[47:53] now the devil wants to make things big
[47:54] and bright God wants to keep things
[47:57] humble a superon you'll find the baby
[48:00] wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in
[48:02] the manger this will be a sign this will
[48:05] be a super sign when he was on Earth he
[48:08] was so poor how how we could talk about
[48:11] hard
[48:12] times who is this little one it's
[48:15] Jehovah Jehovah God became a man took on
[48:19] our stock crossed himself from God and
[48:22] become man there's the sign was God and
[48:27] become man not rich man but poor man
[48:30] this is the super sign you've asked for
[48:32] a sign said God I'll give you one an
[48:36] everlasting sign a super sign God in
[48:41] flesh God in flesh I I I think about
[48:45] that he says he could have come
[48:46] otherwise as as I've said but a baby why
[48:50] did he become a baby when the first
[48:52] little toothless mouth opened in that
[48:55] Manger
[48:56] uh uh on on the first crib the first
[48:59] Christmas morning in his little manger
[49:02] crib the first little yell that went
[49:04] from his voice that was God crying
[49:07] Jehovah crying a man come from God and
[49:12] was a man ever wit man and come to uh to
[49:16] the world with nothing but still man
[49:19] what was he trying to do what was he
[49:22] purposing he cried like a baby in the
[49:24] manger he played like a boy on the
[49:27] street he toiled like a man but yet he
[49:30] was
[49:31] Emmanuel this is the super sign God
[49:35] dwelling in the creation he created the
[49:39] super I it shall be a sign unto
[49:46] you the great oh my we would think when
[49:50] God would come down that surely he would
[49:53] come down as as great Angelic being
[49:56] bright and shiny and and and would open
[50:00] our eyes to let us know but you see he
[50:02] come veiled he was so veiled that no one
[50:06] even recognized who he was now when we
[50:09] talk about the great God King Of Heaven
[50:11] and Earth the great Creator and we say
[50:14] that great Creator became Our Savior
[50:17] could you children under really imagine
[50:20] what it would be like Amen to to to
[50:23] recognize that your friend that you are
[50:26] playing with is Jehovah God that your
[50:31] friend your you you play with you sleep
[50:35] with you you go to school with is
[50:39] Jehovah God living in that body he says
[50:44] he was so poor when he come to Earth he
[50:47] come through a borrowed
[50:48] womb a borrowed womb of a woman he had
[50:51] to borrow a grave to be buried in God a
[50:54] virgin shall conceive without sexual uh
[50:58] interception amen Jehovah borrowed the
[51:01] womb of Mary a woman to perform the duty
[51:04] that he had given an everlasting sign he
[51:07] was so poor amen now I I I I like that
[51:11] he says can you see the real sign it's
[51:14] Jehovah become one of us and as I got to
[51:18] think in here this evening keep your
[51:20] Doctrine simple what's what's what's God
[51:23] doing what does Christmas
[51:26] mean it was God coming in a body to take
[51:31] care of sin take care to to to bridge
[51:36] the gap amen so that he could live in
[51:41] you so that he could live his eternal
[51:45] life through you hallelujah amen I I I I
[51:50] I I think about it when God was going to
[51:52] come when Jesus did come
[51:56] and there he was and and and and we we
[52:00] we know that he was born in the in the
[52:03] stable there in Bethlehem and how the
[52:06] predestinated plan of God always works
[52:08] now she was a child and they had to
[52:11] travel from uh uh from from Nazareth
[52:14] over to Bethlehem and here's you it was
[52:17] such a it was such a a a hardship on her
[52:22] on Mary she didn't feel like being on
[52:25] that donkey and but but yet God had put
[52:28] in the heart of the king to demand
[52:30] everyone to come to pay their
[52:33] taxes because God had already
[52:36] predestinated a little stable God had
[52:39] already predestinated a little place he
[52:42] had already said it would be little
[52:44] Bethlehem that was going to give birth
[52:47] to that child and here she was in the
[52:51] hardship amen it was a hardship on her
[52:54] amen having her labor pains and not
[52:57] feeling good and barely making it over
[53:00] there and saying amen and and and
[53:03] brother Brandon would give the would
[53:04] would would give the illustration as he
[53:07] says he he he looked back at her and
[53:09] noticed that she was awfully quiet and
[53:13] and and Joseph looking and and seeing
[53:15] the Moonlight as it's reflecting off of
[53:18] off of her face and amen and and and and
[53:22] he's are you okay honey and I and she
[53:26] said yeah I I I think so and amen and
[53:29] before you know it she's saying I I'm
[53:32] fixing to have this baby I I've got to
[53:36] have a place and and and when he goes
[53:38] trying to find a room and trying to find
[53:41] a good place for his wife why there was
[53:43] no place that was all part of
[53:46] predestination amen God didn't want his
[53:48] baby born in a nice place God was going
[53:52] his he was going to come down you in a
[53:55] stable in a barn over manure that's
[53:59] where God wanted to be born God didn't
[54:01] want to be born in a in a hospital God
[54:04] didn't want to be born God wanted to be
[54:08] born among the most
[54:10] simple God wanted his first his first
[54:15] breath as a human to be in a simple
[54:19] humble
[54:22] Place sometimes you might think I I I
[54:24] think this way sometimes in my houses
[54:27] that I you know I haven't lived in too
[54:28] many houses since I've been in py but
[54:31] amen I we have preachers come and stay
[54:33] with us and I think oh my oh my house is
[54:37] oh it don't it's not fit for a it's not
[54:40] fit for a holy man of God like this I I
[54:43] I I you know when we have these
[54:45] wonderful preachers where I mean whoever
[54:47] it is I I get a little bit embarrassed
[54:49] for him to come and look at my house or
[54:51] to stay in my bedroom and and and then I
[54:54] go back back to thinking when God come
[54:56] to Earth God God God came and he chose
[55:01] God chose a
[55:04] stap God chose
[55:08] humility God could have come any way he
[55:10] wanted to come God came and chose a
[55:14] humble
[55:16] place oh Hallelujah aren't you glad and
[55:20] I I want to say here today God loves
[55:23] your little humble h too if you'll make
[55:26] him welcome God would rather live in
[55:29] your Humble House than to live in a nice
[55:31] fancy house up here on the hill God
[55:34] would rather live if you would make him
[55:38] welcome in your home why God loves being
[55:42] in your simple place can you say Amen
[55:46] you see God doesn't ask us to keep
[55:48] things simple God asked us to keep
[55:51] things simple because he's simple right
[55:55] he's simple so if we want to please God
[56:00] then we must keep things simple
[56:02] ourselves oh can you say man brother
[56:05] brandham says he promised the same thing
[56:08] in this day I wonder if we I wonder if
[56:11] if we would recognize it the proud and
[56:14] the wise had never received such a thing
[56:16] as that they believed if there was such
[56:19] a thing as the Messiah on Earth it would
[56:22] certainly have to come to their
[56:24] denomination
[56:25] it would be in their group to receive it
[56:28] or it wasn't right now now just think
[56:31] right hard remember the renom say now
[56:33] just think about this because they the
[56:36] world thinks it's got to be in it's got
[56:40] to be in the upper asalon because if he
[56:42] does come he's got to come through our
[56:45] organization he's got to come through
[56:46] our set of rules he's got to come
[56:48] through but when God came you know who
[56:51] God came to first you know who Heaven
[56:54] came came to declare the good news to
[56:58] First yeah he didn't go to Caiaphas the
[57:02] high
[57:03] priest he didn't go to these other
[57:07] men you know who the Angels appeared
[57:10] to he appeared to stinking
[57:15] Shepherds when God appeared he appeared
[57:19] to simple
[57:21] people hallelujah now M you get upset
[57:24] with your boys for not wanting to take
[57:25] baths well God appeared to men that
[57:28] hadn't taken a bath in a couple of days
[57:31] hallelujah amen now now boys take baths
[57:34] amen we we don't want to we don't want
[57:36] you stinking around here but God
[57:39] appeared un stinking
[57:42] smelling Shepherds did you know that the
[57:46] shepherds are they live so much with the
[57:49] sheep that they smell like the
[57:52] Sheep they Bel and smell like sheep
[57:57] Hallelujah they beef and smell like
[58:01] sheep they they they uh uh uh they
[58:07] brother bradam says they even they're
[58:09] around the shepher so much or they're
[58:11] around the Sheep so much that they even
[58:15] laugh like
[58:17] sheep Hallelujah now now watch this he
[58:22] said brother brandom says now the
[58:24] highest Heavens
[58:27] hastening to honor Earth Earth's most
[58:31] humble and unlearned now he's talking
[58:33] about the Shepherds the highest of
[58:35] Heavens come down to make himself known
[58:39] to the lowest of the earth bypassing all
[58:43] between to make himself known to the
[58:45] common herdsman coming to give these
[58:48] common herdsman the greatest message Of
[58:52] All Times amen
[58:55] Hallelujah now brother Josh sent that
[58:57] today and I thought that was really good
[58:59] amen was that the one you sent today
[59:01] amen I I I got a bunch of them here uh
[59:04] that that just just little just little
[59:06] uh deals on the Shepherds and another
[59:08] one he says but God chooses the
[59:12] nobody that's the reason he chose the
[59:15] shepherd shepherds are completely at
[59:18] home with God's lamb in their
[59:21] midst his word made flesh a among them
[59:26] the proud and the wise never receive it
[59:30] it passed them by can you say Amen so
[59:34] God chooses the nobody the simple I I I
[59:38] I I want us to really think here today
[59:41] God is looking for someone that can
[59:45] receive this word in in their hour now
[59:51] while we know that Christmas was was was
[59:54] God on Earth amen we we're living in
[59:57] another Christmas this bride has has has
[1:00:01] given birth to another anointing it's
[1:00:04] given birth to the word we are we are
[1:00:07] flesh made word brother bradam says now
[1:00:09] that was word made flesh he says but
[1:00:13] today it's the flesh made word it is you
[1:00:17] and I becoming more like him and the
[1:00:21] only way that we can do that is to

[1:00:42] is on the earth amen now it was only
[1:00:44] revealed to a handful of people and
[1:00:47] their response was praise and adoration
[1:00:52] and humility brother Rand would say it

[1:00:58] bypassed all of the Nobles and was
[1:01:00] revealed to the nobodies all the Nobles
[1:01:03] that were decorated with doctor's
[1:01:05] Divinity and psychology and highly
[1:01:07] educations and great Cathedrals and
[1:01:10] things it was all bypassed and revealed
[1:01:13] to no bodies the wisdom the infinite
[1:01:16] wisdom of the almighty God did it to
[1:01:19] make known to them the greatest message
[1:01:22] ever was the mess Messiah is now on
[1:01:27] Earth what a wisdom could only come from
[1:01:31] God who knows wisdom but you see the
[1:01:35] Jews failed to identify that they failed
[1:01:38] to see that amen a and and and but but I
[1:01:41] want to say when God is

[1:02:56] few quotes here to for you for us to
[1:02:59] look at amen praise the Lord you you you
[1:03:03] see it was it was it was something amen
[1:03:07] God coming and showing
[1:03:10] now as we as as we look here the
[1:03:14] Shepherds were sung too so here comes
[1:03:17] the Angels the angels are singing unto
[1:03:20] these Shepherds then they tell the
[1:03:22] Shepherds we want you to go to a c
[1:03:24] certain place we want you to go look at
[1:03:26] a certain stable and you will find this
[1:03:29] Christ child living there now brother
[1:03:32] brandham says now no other no no other
[1:03:36] person would have followed this they
[1:03:38] would not have believed it but the
[1:03:41] Shepherds were told to go to the stable
[1:03:46] and there they would find the word of
[1:03:49] God
[1:03:51] fulfilled brother brandham says when
[1:03:53] they got there
[1:03:55] and when they went down the street
[1:03:56] exactly like the angel told them to get
[1:03:58] there and they opened the barn door and
[1:04:02] they look and there is the Christ child
[1:04:05] laying right there where God had told
[1:04:08] him he says the word of God fulfilled in
[1:04:12] their midst created a a created such a a
[1:04:17] a shouting and a praising and a and a
[1:04:21] glorifying God because they found the
[1:04:25] baby exactly where the angel said that
[1:04:28] he would
[1:04:30] be can you say Amen oh my now amen uh uh
[1:04:36] uh brother renam would say notice out
[1:04:39] praising and glorifying God for what
[1:04:42] they had seen and heard they heard the
[1:04:44] Angels Sing for their first time to a
[1:04:46] human being Angels had never sung to a
[1:04:49] human being before and look at the
[1:04:51] choirs how they had stood and TR trained
[1:04:54] and trained those voices and they' sing
[1:04:56] at the birth of the Messiah and they
[1:04:59] were all bypassed and Angels come and
[1:05:02] sung to the common Sheepman not with
[1:05:05] clergy clothes on but with Shepherd's
[1:05:07] clothes on look who got the first
[1:05:10] message it was incredible can you say
[1:05:14] amen he says and when they found the
[1:05:17] baby what a joy it must have been to
[1:05:20] them because the angel that gave them
[1:05:23] the message message they found it just
[1:05:26] exactly the way the angel said it would
[1:05:28] be just in the place where the angel
[1:05:31] said it would be what a thing that must
[1:05:35] have been to them in a Manger why see
[1:05:39] how at ease these herdsmen were in the
[1:05:42] stable what what do you think a
[1:05:44] theologian would have done in there why
[1:05:46] he would have put a pin over his nose
[1:05:48] and said get me out of this place see he
[1:05:51] would have been so out of place he's
[1:05:54] been he he'd have been in misery but you
[1:05:56] see it was just at home to the Shepherds
[1:06:00] God knows where to send his
[1:06:03] message someone say hallelujah
[1:06:06] hallelujah he said see just exactly
[1:06:09] right in this state the Shepherds was in
[1:06:11] then in their stable was their lamb a
[1:06:15] Vindicated message that they had heard
[1:06:18] how beautiful in the presence of the
[1:06:21] Messiah the V Vindicated word of their
[1:06:24] message when the Shepherds heard that
[1:06:26] the Messiah was on Earth and come into
[1:06:29] His presence right in their own
[1:06:31] environment and found the message to be
[1:06:34] true and was Vindicated there how that
[1:06:37] must have made those men feel to find
[1:06:40] that God had done this great thing for
[1:06:46] them Common
[1:06:49] People common simple
[1:06:52] people py
[1:06:55] people simple

[1:07:21] probably be out there joining the crowd
[1:07:24] against Israel anyways amen the all of
[1:07:28] the all of the the simple people did you
[1:07:31] know the Bible says and the Common
[1:07:33] People heard
[1:07:35] him
[1:07:39] gladly Shepherds I think as
[1:07:42] preachers we we we feel at ease with the
[1:07:45] Vindicated
[1:07:46] lamb I would rather as a man of God I
[1:07:49] would
[1:07:51] rather have something that's Vindicated
[1:07:54] and God coming down to back it up than
[1:07:57] than to be one that has that that that
[1:08:00] tries to dot all of the teas and cross
[1:08:02] uh uh or dot all the eyes and cross all
[1:08:04] the teas and make everything all come
[1:08:07] out pretty I would rather the
[1:08:10] supernatural presence of God to be with
[1:08:13] me amen than than I would to to to
[1:08:18] preach in the biggest of churches and uh
[1:08:20] have the finest and I I I would I would
[1:08:23] rather be in the Vindicated word than
[1:08:27] anything else in the
[1:08:29] world hallelujah how about you Shepherds
[1:08:32] at the of the home wouldn't you all just
[1:08:35] rather have the Vindication of God
[1:08:37] supernaturally upon your home saying I
[1:08:40] am pleased with this home how about you
[1:08:43] mamas with your children wouldn't you
[1:08:44] rather just have the supernatural
[1:08:47] presence of God in your home saying I I
[1:08:51] I vindicate I validate I am here to say
[1:08:55] I approve of the way that you are
[1:08:57] handling this home oh come on church
[1:09:01] amen the other guys would not been at
[1:09:04] home but the lamb was welcome among the
[1:09:11] Shepherds I want to be that kind not a
[1:09:15] lot of Education not a lot of not not
[1:09:17] not a lot of put on just let me have the
[1:09:21] realities of the prophecy
[1:09:24] they were there in the midst of Prophecy
[1:09:29] they found the they found Isaiah 9:6
[1:09:34] they found Isaiah 7:14 they found all of
[1:09:37] these prophecies they them
[1:09:41] Hallelujah the preachers didn't know it
[1:09:44] no one knew it God came to those
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:49] poor ignorant
[1:09:52] people and showed them he's laying here
[1:09:57] this is what we've been looking
[1:10:00] for hallelujah oh come on church I you
[1:10:04] know I I I I would I want that kind of
[1:10:06] approval I think sometimes we we we are
[1:10:08] seeking too many other kinds of approval
[1:10:10] we we you know sometimes we're so busy
[1:10:12] we we get we allow the devil to pull us
[1:10:15] completely out of the presence of God
[1:10:18] out of the revealed word for the hour
[1:10:21] out of his out of his anoint oting Upon
[1:10:24] Our Lives simply because we want to do
[1:10:28] something in
[1:10:30] ourself come on and before you know it
[1:10:33] we're miserable and and and and and but
[1:10:38] they could not those men had it all
[1:10:43] figured out come
[1:10:46] on
[1:10:47] Hallelujah but those
[1:10:49] humble that could hear the voice of God
[1:10:52] now brother brandom says there was a
[1:10:53] reason why he could come to the
[1:10:54] Shepherds because those Shepherds knew a
[1:10:57] lamb when they seen a
[1:10:59] lamb amen and when they come and seen
[1:11:01] the lamb they knew the lamb that this
[1:11:04] truly was the Lamb of
[1:11:07] God I oh god oh Hallelujah let that word
[1:11:12] now now brother brother brandham would
[1:11:13] say he would say now he said but the
[1:11:16] Shepherds felt completely at ease in
[1:11:19] that place with God's lamb and any good
[1:11:21] shepherd does the same thing when a Good
[1:11:24] Shepherd over the sheep can see the word
[1:11:26] of God made plain and Vindicated of what
[1:11:29] he promised to do the Shepherds right at
[1:11:32] home I don't care what anyone else says
[1:11:35] there's God's Pro God promised it and
[1:11:38] God did it you say the days of Miracles
[1:11:40] has passed well there's no such thing as
[1:11:42] the baptism of the spirit there's no
[1:11:43] such thing as the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:45] Ghost that was all for the apostles but
[1:11:47] let a true Shepherd of the word preach
[1:11:49] it in the power of the Resurrection that
[1:11:51] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:11:53] and forever Peter said on the day of
[1:11:55] Pentecost the promises unto you to your
[1:11:57] children to them that are far off even
[1:11:59] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:12:01] whereever he calls the promise and the
[1:12:04] same blessing is true let a genuine word
[1:12:07] feeding Shepherd see that Vindicated all
[1:12:10] the theologians in the world can't take
[1:12:12] it away from him because he knows God
[1:12:15] said so and it's
[1:12:17] happened that's all it's just God's word
[1:12:21] always his word was made flesh and was
[1:12:24] dwelling among them and they knew it
[1:12:28] not can you say
[1:12:32] Amen
[1:12:35] now in my thoughts of the Simplicity of
[1:12:39] God on
[1:12:41] Earth there were so many things that
[1:12:43] brother brandham said
[1:12:46] about about the son of man and how the
[1:12:50] the last day and how it would bring it
[1:12:53] would bring deity back to Earth and
[1:12:57] brother brandom would say things like
[1:13:00] the the the word becoming one with a
[1:13:03] Believer and and and he would he would
[1:13:05] list the he would list the three stages
[1:13:08] and and and we we we you you would have
[1:13:11] he he he he list the you know as as we
[1:13:14] talked the other night you know as the
[1:13:16] as the wheat plant is is being restored
[1:13:18] remember the nub and and then there
[1:13:20] would be some shoots come up and then
[1:13:22] here here you would come on up and then
[1:13:24] there would be the the you know the the
[1:13:26] the stock and and the and and then there
[1:13:29] would be the shuck that would come up
[1:13:31] and and and and how beautiful it is to
[1:13:33] see that because truly we can see that
[1:13:36] in the scripture here's the blades of
[1:13:37] GRA here's justification and then the
[1:13:39] life comes on up through sanctification
[1:13:42] and then and then this here all dies off
[1:13:44] it just it just shrivels up and becomes
[1:13:46] nothing and then as you're coming on up
[1:13:47] and then you've got the the the the
[1:13:49] speaking in tongues and the gifts and
[1:13:51] all of those kinds of things on 1906 six
[1:13:53] ausa Street and how oh how wonderful it
[1:13:56] was and and and brother brandham even
[1:13:58] back in the day was saying now listen in
[1:14:01] the adoption series if y'all remember he
[1:14:03] was saying it it don't stop there
[1:14:05] there's more there's more you got to
[1:14:08] keep going right he says don't and then
[1:14:10] before you know it what did they do they
[1:14:12] begin to denominate and and and it
[1:14:14] looked like but as they're in 1963 here
[1:14:17] come the word that was promised to come
[1:14:20] the lamb somebody say lamb lamb the lamb
[1:14:25] that was born in Bethlehem is now the
[1:14:28] lamb coming back taking a bookl are
[1:14:31] y'all hearing me it's not a baby lamb
[1:14:33] anymore now it's the lamb taking the
[1:14:35] book that the baby lamb purchased so now
[1:14:39] the lamb is coming with the word and the
[1:14:42] ones that refuse to see the lamb then is
[1:14:45] the ones that can't see the lamb now and
[1:14:48] brother brandham was saying oh the
[1:14:50] tongues and things are wonderful but if
[1:14:52] you can't see the purpose of the plant
[1:14:56] then you're going to fail to miss the
[1:14:59] realities of the word amen right so what
[1:15:03] did they do they aborted the Shu aborted
[1:15:07] the seed but that doesn't do away with
[1:15:10] you and I now yeah the plant goes away
[1:15:12] this all dies it all just totally dies
[1:15:15] and there's nothing left but the wheat
[1:15:17] seeds in the hand of God can you say
[1:15:20] Amen the wheat now now the life now when
[1:15:24] we talk about the life that is in that
[1:15:27] that is in the church we're talking
[1:15:30] about the very words of
[1:15:33] Prophecy now
[1:15:35] living in you now I'm going to just read
[1:15:38] a few quiet as I say I this is not a
[1:15:40] prepared sermon whatsoever
[1:15:42] hallelujah
[1:15:44] amen but I I want to show you I want to
[1:15:47] show you a few things that I a couple of
[1:15:50] quotes here man be you lovey praise the
[1:15:53] Lord if I can let let me let me look
[1:15:56] here and find this quote here
[1:15:58] amen praise the Lord now he would say
[1:16:02] now
[1:16:03] Jesus uh in in the trial he says you now
[1:16:07] he identified himself in the ministry as
[1:16:09] a man and not the not a son of God but
[1:16:12] the son of man God is a spirit he
[1:16:15] revealed himself as the son of man what
[1:16:18] he claimed to be and they were blinded
[1:16:21] and could not see it now unto the
[1:16:24] Gentiles he reveals himself uh now the
[1:16:26] son son of God which is the Holy Ghost
[1:16:30] uh but Jesus said as it was in the days
[1:16:32] of Sodom I want this blind prosecutor to
[1:16:36] see he's a blind interpreter of the word
[1:16:40] always he takes his organizational ideas
[1:16:44] and knows no more about it than nothing
[1:16:48] he does it to deceive because he's a
[1:16:51] deceiver at the beginning
[1:16:53] now Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:16:56] Sodom when the son of man I want you all
[1:16:59] to repeat son of man is revealed he says
[1:17:04] in the days of Sodom was the son of man
[1:17:08] revealed God revealed in human flesh
[1:17:11] which was one time called MDC the father
[1:17:14] mzc at the beginning had no father no
[1:17:17] mother no beginning of days no ending of
[1:17:19] life ever who he was he Remains the Same
[1:17:22] Jesus had father and mother but this man
[1:17:25] had neither father nor mother he
[1:17:27] appeared to Abraham in the form of Son
[1:17:30] of Man Elohim Jehovah the church now has
[1:17:35] served the term through the church age
[1:17:38] all seven ages in the baptism of the
[1:17:41] Holy Ghost but Jesus said here to make
[1:17:44] Malachi 4 and the rest of the scriptures
[1:17:46] real to you that in the last days just
[1:17:49] before the coming the world be setting
[1:17:52] like in Sodom and the son of man uh will
[1:17:56] reveal himself as the son of man like he
[1:17:59] did in the days of Sodom amen now to
[1:18:03] make it clear we have had we have been
[1:18:05] living under the Holy Ghost anointing
[1:18:09] all of these time the entire time but in
[1:18:12] this last day the son of man and again
[1:18:16] what is what did Brother brandom tell us
[1:18:18] the son of man is God in flesh the
[1:18:23] anointing has been upon Wesley had the
[1:18:27] Holy Ghost upon
[1:18:29] him right but he was not he was not he
[1:18:32] was not the seed of the plant Wesley had
[1:18:37] the anointing upon him the same life
[1:18:41] amen I didn't look anything like this
[1:18:42] seed that went into the ground Pentecost
[1:18:44] had the anointing and it was
[1:18:47] wonderful but the promise is that there
[1:18:50] is going to come a people that God's
[1:18:52] going to Rapture and it will be word or
[1:18:56] flesh made word it'll be the word

[1:21:18] believe when I I I I just asked you kids
[1:21:21] a while ago what would y'all think if
[1:21:24] you were the ones that went to school
[1:21:27] with Jesus had him over to your house or
[1:21:30] or or or ate lunch with him or amen but
[1:21:34] I'm going to say you are going to school
[1:21:37] with Jesus or you are eating with Jesus
[1:21:40] Christ and his bride has become
[1:21:44] one now what are we to expect Jesus done
[1:21:47] no
[1:21:49] Miracles uh uh uh when he was a little
[1:21:51] kid no one no one matter of fact he
[1:21:53] didn't do any Miracles until he was 30
[1:21:55] years old and sometimes we want to look
[1:21:56] around and and it's so easy just to look
[1:21:58] at each other as just common people
[1:22:01] you're not a common person you're Sons
[1:22:04] and Daughters of God you are you have
[1:22:07] the very life of God within
[1:22:13] you

[1:23:10] to the Holy Spirit and that presence now

[1:27:31] anything that went in the ground but the
[1:27:34] promise to you and the son of man

[1:28:09] to say Rapture time is upon
[1:28:12] us oh come on you you ever get just a
[1:28:15] little bit miserable on the inside
[1:28:17] saying what is it it is God saying come
[1:28:19] on up a little bit higher and you ain't
[1:28:21] going to find it by a new car a new
[1:28:22] house you ain't going to find it by amen
[1:28:24] a new sermon style you ain't going to
[1:28:25] find it by singing a new song you're
[1:28:27] going to find it amen as God is calling
[1:28:29] you up higher into that seed life into
[1:28:33] greater maturity raising you up in the
[1:28:36] power of the Holy Ghost and when he
[1:28:38] raises you up amen you are an obedient
[1:28:42] Faith woman you're just waiting for that
[1:28:44] life to be made manifest now now you're
[1:28:46] not out shopping and you're not out you
[1:28:49] there's something about this Amen on the
[1:28:51] inside it driving you into prayer amen
[1:28:53] God fulfill your life in Me God I know
[1:28:59] that I am the reason for this
[1:29:03] season can you say
[1:29:06] Amen well do you love
[1:29:08] him now brother Brandon would
[1:29:12] say he says it's been one of the most
[1:29:15] amazing things that I have noted along
[1:29:19] the lines of my Ministry for our lord
[1:29:21] Jesus
[1:29:22] is the peculiarity of people the study
[1:29:25] of human life is one of the greatest
[1:29:27] things that a person can study so watch
[1:29:30] the nature of people and the different
[1:29:32] parts of the Nations and the worlds to
[1:29:35] where you go you notice that there's a
[1:29:37] different attitude that people take
[1:29:39] towards Christ towards his service
[1:29:41] towards his servants towards worship and
[1:29:44] one of the things that has been uh that
[1:29:48] that one type of meeting will uh uh will
[1:29:51] be just one wonderful in one part of the
[1:29:53] country where it won't even work where
[1:29:54] it won't work in the other part of the
[1:29:57] country I believe mostly to blame or not
[1:29:59] to blame but mostly is the way the
[1:30:01] people are taught the church will never
[1:30:04] live any higher than as Pastor teaches
[1:30:06] you seldom find that if you got a good
[1:30:10] sounds gospel teacher you'll usually
[1:30:13] find the type of that type of church
[1:30:16] it's just what your pastor leads you the
[1:30:18] pastors that you feed on can you amen
[1:30:23] and so amen so as as the ministry we can
[1:30:26] see how how where where we we we we can
[1:30:31] see the importance of that job of our
[1:30:34] job to to to pointing the people to that
[1:30:39] living Christ not to a not to a window
[1:30:43] not to a not to an emotion but point the
[1:30:47] people to Jesus Christ because there is
[1:30:50] where people are missing it
[1:30:52] now that doesn't mean that people are
[1:30:54] going to follow it you know they'll
[1:30:56] they'll they'll you you can do whichever
[1:30:58] way you want to but I want to tell you
[1:31:00] the message is there saying the son of
[1:31:04] man is here with son of man anointing
[1:31:08] word made flesh can you say Amen how
[1:31:13] many wants to be simple in your
[1:31:16] Doctrine don't let me don't don't don't
[1:31:18] don't let me
[1:31:20] just I I I I I don't want to be
[1:31:22] satisfied at all until I
[1:31:25] have the blessings of God upon me in my
[1:31:29] heart in my home in in my church come on
[1:31:34] now hallelujah amen hallelujah when I
[1:31:38] was a kid we used to put a whole bunch
[1:31:39] on music and and uh uh uh we we we we
[1:31:45] loved it all but one of the greatest
[1:31:46] things that I I've remember one of the
[1:31:48] greatest things that that that that when
[1:31:51] the Lord showed me when coming into this
[1:31:53] message amen he had showed me that I you
[1:31:57] know in the in in the dream that God had
[1:31:59] given me that when I was struggling
[1:32:01] trying to figure out which way to go and
[1:32:03] and God showed me took me down a in in a
[1:32:07] Wilderness Area just Wilderness and
[1:32:10] which means confusion and all of this
[1:32:13] music it was like music you know all in
[1:32:15] a circle and and and and the guitars
[1:32:17] were broke and the piano was broke and
[1:32:19] the drums were broke and everything was
[1:32:21] all messed up and I I'm over there
[1:32:24] attracted to music thinking hey I can
[1:32:26] fix this so I'm over trying to get the
[1:32:28] guitar fix and this then I'm looking at
[1:32:30] this and and and and there's this man
[1:32:32] that I thought was my grandfather that
[1:32:34] had been leading me amen had had some
[1:32:36] gray hair and a little ball and and so I
[1:32:39] I in in this Wilderness and I and but
[1:32:42] and and and and the voice was and the
[1:32:44] man was saying hey come you got to let
[1:32:46] it go you got to let it go and I I said
[1:32:49] okay all right just a minute so I'm over
[1:32:50] here and and and and the voice said you
[1:32:52] got to let it go and and and and finally
[1:32:55] the stern voice said let it
[1:32:59] alone and I turned
[1:33:02] around and it wasn't my grandfather at
[1:33:04] all it was brother
[1:33:08] brandom and I looked at him and he's
[1:33:10] looking at me with those piercing
[1:33:12] eyes
[1:33:13] and reluctantly I let I I let go of the
[1:33:18] guitar and I started following him in
[1:33:21] this in this in in this uh in this in
[1:33:24] this wooded area and he led me
[1:33:27] out and and then came across the most
[1:33:30] beautiful
[1:33:33] Oasis and others were trying to fish and
[1:33:35] things and and and and then and and this
[1:33:37] man says do you want to learn to
[1:33:40] fish or you want me to teach you to fish
[1:33:43] and I said well yeah that would be nice
[1:33:45] you know and and and so you know he he
[1:33:50] threw something out and and like a box
[1:33:53] in the water or something and and before
[1:33:55] you know it there was and he had this
[1:33:57] rope and and and and these big old fish
[1:34:00] were coming in and he's pulling it in
[1:34:02] and and he turned around and looked at
[1:34:05] me and he says if you'll be sincere and
[1:34:08] listen to what I tell you you'll Feed My
[1:34:14] People well when I woke
[1:34:16] up the tears my pillow was
[1:34:20] wet I'd been
[1:34:22] crying as as as I was there and and Dad
[1:34:26] remembers that that that area of time I
[1:34:28] was really I was I was I was confused
[1:34:30] torn up ready to walk away from the
[1:34:32] ministry and everything else God had
[1:34:33] brought me to that point and and and
[1:34:37] when but when it was and and and the
[1:34:39] beautiful thing was is when I when I I I
[1:34:42] I I woke up in the in the in uh when he
[1:34:45] told me that I just started
[1:34:47] crying as brother Bram was looking at me
[1:34:50] and then off looked over behind brother
[1:34:52] brandom a little a little ways off and
[1:34:54] there was my father and he was crying
[1:34:57] and we hugged in the in in the dream and
[1:35:00] then I woke up and I'm crying and this
[1:35:02] is this is this is this is the honest
[1:35:05] truth there was a little glow at the end
[1:35:07] of my bed that that that sat there for
[1:35:09] what seemed to be forever it just just
[1:35:12] seemed to be a little bit of a little
[1:35:14] glow down there that was when that was
[1:35:16] when I was willing to throw everything
[1:35:18] else aside and say Lord if you'll teach
[1:35:20] me
[1:35:22] amen and I believe and of course I
[1:35:25] didn't know anything about the message
[1:35:27] all I had was the adoption series amen
[1:35:30] and and uh uh but but the Lord was was
[1:35:34] was doing what what was taking place it
[1:35:37] was the son of man
[1:35:39] anointing that would not allow me you
[1:35:42] see the the anointing the
[1:35:45] anointing here was sanctification so
[1:35:48] when the anointing hit or or
[1:35:50] justification
[1:35:52] the anointing that HD here just caused
[1:35:54] it to to be sanctification that was the
[1:35:56] stop the anointing here caused H H it
[1:36:00] was the shock caus him to speak in
[1:36:02] tongues and things of that
[1:36:05] nature now now now catch this and and
[1:36:08] and I'm closing I don't know what time
[1:36:09] it is but brother brandham said now the
[1:36:11] church this whole time has been under
[1:36:15] the Son of
[1:36:19] God Amen yes the Son of God Amen and I
[1:36:23] should include the Shu up there with it
[1:36:25] because the Shu 1906 was part of that
[1:36:27] Son of God he said the Son of God is the
[1:36:30] Holy Ghost he says it
[1:36:33] changes right before the coming of the
[1:36:35] Lord to the son of man through the
[1:36:37] prophetic Ministry so I was still in the
[1:36:42] shook I was still in the Pentecostal
[1:36:45] shock but I was ordained in the
[1:36:49] seed so the shock had to push me
[1:36:54] out because there was son of man holy
[1:36:58] ghost that was pulling me up higher
[1:37:01] that's right this here was on the flesh
[1:37:02] this here was was on this here was was
[1:37:05] wonderful on the flesh but you see this
[1:37:08] here was the was the son of man where
[1:37:10] the word
[1:37:12] coming it was like God saying you're not
[1:37:15] one of those intellectual guys I've got
[1:37:18] something predestinated in your heart
[1:37:21] here's the Word of Life are y'all
[1:37:24] understanding does that make sense or no
[1:37:27] amen so so the the the when I say the
[1:37:30] son of man uh uh brother did I read that
[1:37:32] to you did I did I read that to you
[1:37:34] where we have the church age has been
[1:37:36] under the Son of God the Holy Ghost I
[1:37:38] read that to youall right amen I I I I
[1:37:42] think I did
[1:37:46] hallelujah amen if the musicians would
[1:37:48] go ahead and come on
[1:37:50] up
[1:37:52] yeah the church now has served the term
[1:37:54] through the church age in the baptism of
[1:37:56] the Holy Ghost and he goes through
[1:37:57] sanctification or justification
[1:37:58] sanctification Holy Ghost but he says
[1:38:00] but Jesus here amen just before the
[1:38:03] coming that the son of man would be
[1:38:06] revealed and the son of man you would
[1:38:09] marry to the word there would be a
[1:38:12] reality of every promise of the Bible
[1:38:16] made real to you see some people think
[1:38:20] that we're trying to make a fourth stage
[1:38:21] out of justification sanctification
[1:38:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you
[1:38:25] have to be adopted no we're living in
[1:38:27] the age of
[1:38:30] adoption there's three stages to the New
[1:38:33] Birth justification sanctification
[1:38:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost sir to receive
[1:38:39] the Holy Ghost in Luther's day you were
[1:38:41] Justified to receive the Holy Ghost in
[1:38:44] Wesley's day you were Sanctified to
[1:38:46] receive the Holy Ghost in 1906 you spoke
[1:38:49] with tongues to receive the the Holy
[1:38:51] Ghost today you will believe this
[1:38:53] message amen yes sir
[1:38:57] am there is no other stage when you
[1:39:01] receive the Holy Ghost you are receiving
[1:39:04] the message of adoption y y'all
[1:39:07] understand that there's three stages to
[1:39:10] the new birth that's what happened on
[1:39:12] the day of Pentecost that was the new
[1:39:14] birth but brother bradam remember the
[1:39:16] the quote that I read to y'all last week
[1:39:18] God did not
[1:39:19] replant a new plant the seed and the nub
[1:39:24] was sticking up remember he did not
[1:39:26] replant there's four stages to
[1:39:32] Restoration come on
[1:39:35] now that's the church that's that's the
[1:39:38] church life that's this is where we've
[1:39:39] gone from from from the fifth age sixth
[1:39:43] age seventh age at the end of this
[1:39:46] seventh age it's time for Rapture God's
[1:39:48] quickening that word through a prophet
[1:39:51] phc Ministry preparing us to go up uh to
[1:39:54] to to to be caught away are y'all
[1:39:56] catching that amen and that's why that
[1:39:59] that that son of man Ministry no one
[1:40:02] else is going to recognize it that's
[1:40:04] right no one's going to recognize it
[1:40:06] only you can recognize it
[1:40:09] amen you're the ones that the angel has
[1:40:12] come to that's right you're the
[1:40:16] ones you're the ones that the angel says
[1:40:18] go look in the word and see if it's not
[1:40:21] there that's right go look and see if
[1:40:24] I'm not fulfilling my word you see what
[1:40:27] I'm saying so so though we had though
[1:40:30] though we had the three stages of of
[1:40:35] justification and
[1:40:40] sanctify and then we've got uh Holy
[1:40:43] Ghost
[1:40:48] baptism this is all
[1:40:51] as far as the as far as the uh the
[1:40:58] church this is all in the Son of God
[1:41:02] that's that's all the that's the that's
[1:41:03] the Holy Ghost through the church
[1:41:06] age that's that's that that's all under
[1:41:08] that but the fourth stage of restoration
[1:41:11] has to be a prophet Ministry to bring
[1:41:16] you out of all of this into the finality
[1:41:19] of what Christ was when he went into the
[1:41:21] ground
[1:41:24] right am I making sense or
[1:41:27] no wonderful Holy Ghost wonderful
[1:41:30] sanctification wonderful
[1:41:33] justification but the fourth
[1:41:35] stage in order to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:41:37] in Luther's day
[1:41:39] Justified when you received the Holy
[1:41:42] Ghost in Wesley's day you were
[1:41:44] what when you received it 1906 what did
[1:41:47] you
[1:41:48] do spoke in tongues Amen to receive the
[1:41:52] Holy Ghost today you will
[1:41:54] unequivocally 100% you will believe this
[1:42:02] message it's the son of man anointing
[1:42:05] it's that part of the plan what happens
[1:42:07] to the rest of the
[1:42:09] plant what
[1:42:11] happens hallelujah amen it was nice
[1:42:15] beautiful and green but as this started
[1:42:17] going up this started
[1:42:19] dying as as we get going into the shack
[1:42:23] this starts dying and then as it goes
[1:42:25] into the seed this starts dying before
[1:42:28] you know it everything's all dead it
[1:42:30] looks like it's dead but it's not dead
[1:42:33] the life is in the
[1:42:34] grain can you put that back up S skis
[1:42:37] that we done last week amen the wheat
[1:42:39] and the wheat and the and the shut amen
[1:42:44] it it and and then also that other where
[1:42:46] it's showing the the dead plant
[1:42:48] everything Harvest so everything they
[1:42:50] don't Harvest this God doesn't Harvest
[1:42:52] this that was the church that that was
[1:42:55] just the Avenue that was the vehicle
[1:42:58] that was carrying the seed so
[1:43:00] sanctification that that that original
[1:43:02] Church Luther didn't look anything like
[1:43:04] like like the word that went in the
[1:43:07] ground Wesley had a lot of wonderful
[1:43:09] things but it didn't look anything like
[1:43:11] it went in the ground oh this is where
[1:43:14] it's so deceiving because the shock
[1:43:16] looked so close that it could deceive
[1:43:19] the very elect and it looked close
[1:43:21] it was powerful it was that stage of the
[1:43:23] pl but when the son of man Ministry came
[1:43:28] they said nope nope nope what did it do
[1:43:33] they begin to pull
[1:43:36] back they couldn't see it they didn't
[1:43:39] want it but you
[1:43:42] did because you were predestinated for
[1:43:44] it amen don't you love
[1:43:47] him did you find it sister keys
[1:43:51] so the shack is separated ready to go to
[1:43:55] be
[1:43:55] burned now why do we
[1:43:58] have uh uh there's yeah that's that's
[1:44:02] that's what it lets it looks yeah right
[1:44:04] right there see the one on top is the is
[1:44:07] the shuck or the chaff the one down
[1:44:11] below is the seed now when it's covering
[1:44:15] over put it back to the other one s Keys
[1:44:18] man it looks really close it looks like
[1:44:20] it's wheat but you see it has to pull
[1:44:23] away it has to pull
[1:44:26] away because it was the seed the word
[1:44:28] seed germ seed of God in your heart you
[1:44:30] were predestinated for
[1:44:32] it you predestinated we were
[1:44:35] predestinated for this day the stable
[1:44:39] was predestinated Bethlehem was
[1:44:41] predestinated the Shepherds were
[1:44:43] predestinated Mary was
[1:44:49] predestinated Hallelujah you're
[1:44:51] predestinated for this the prophet was
[1:44:53] predestinated for it why would you come
[1:44:56] and see this light why would you see
[1:44:58] this why is there something crying out
[1:45:00] in
[1:45:01] you now the reason why wh why has
[1:45:04] Pentecost become such just nothing but
[1:45:06] Devils the scripture says that she would
[1:45:09] become a the a a a a cage full of every
[1:45:13] hateful bird and they'd be full of
[1:45:14] iniquity and full of demons and full of
[1:45:18] Amen this is what the church becomes
[1:45:20] when the seed is taken out of it that's
[1:45:23] why that's why when brother bradam says
[1:45:25] you're in the bride age you are taken
[1:45:27] out of the shook you're no longer a part
[1:45:30] of that plant this whole thing is fixing
[1:45:32] to be burned this is going in the
[1:45:34] tribulation you've been pulled out of
[1:45:37] that you're you're you're the one you're
[1:45:39] the little you're the little bundle
[1:45:41] you're you're the little bundle down
[1:45:42] here on the
[1:45:43] bottom that is that is going to be taken
[1:45:45] away
[1:45:49] amen amen so get in the life now make
[1:45:54] don't don't let this just be another
[1:45:56] dogmatic teaching don't let this just be
[1:45:59] another brother this is very very oh my
[1:46:03] the Shepherds when they seen them they
[1:46:06] were
[1:46:07] happy the Angels come to the ignorant

[1:48:11] for sure as I'm standing in this pull
[1:48:13] Pit and the hour is at hand the cold and
[1:48:16] formals weaning away the Evangelical and
[1:48:19] Social Gospel and all these other things
[1:48:21] are gone yeah the Fantastic side is is
[1:48:25] going in such radical fanaticism till
[1:48:27] anybody blind can see it but God is
[1:48:29] pulling out his
[1:48:31] church like the little water lily the
[1:48:33] little the little teeny seed born way
[1:48:35] down in the bottom of a murky muddy
[1:48:38] Mucky dirty frog scummy Pond and it
[1:48:42] winds its way up through the darkness
[1:48:43] through all the mud and through all the
[1:48:45] scum becomes the finest thing you ever
[1:48:48] looked at in the face of with with a
[1:48:50] Radiance like the sunshine so is the
[1:48:52] Church of the Living God that was born
[1:48:54] down in the mud of fanaticism and
[1:48:56] chaos and she's wound her way through
[1:48:59] the gme until she's on the top of the
[1:49:02] thing just waiting for her wings for
[1:49:04] flight many that shall run to and fro
[1:49:06] and the peoples but the people that know
[1:49:08] their God shall do great in uh exploits
[1:49:10] in that day God's Revelations to his
[1:49:13] church set still Little Flock
[1:49:17] positionally stay where you are
[1:49:20] sister Gertie and sister Angie used to
[1:49:22] sing here keep holding on don't worry
[1:49:26] God is waiting and trying and pressing
[1:49:30] to
[1:49:31] get uh to get the mystery of God
[1:49:35] revealed to his church that's what's
[1:49:37] holding back the coming of Christ now in
[1:49:39] the great
[1:49:40] Millennium is that great Supernatural
[1:49:42] power that lays dormant in that church
[1:49:45] can you say
[1:49:47] Amen oh let me just set Steel let me get
[1:49:50] rid of all unbelief come on now I was
[1:49:53] born in this nonsense but I don't belong
[1:49:55] in this nonsense I came out of that of
[1:49:59] of that Shu I came out of that but that
[1:50:03] Shu was never me to begin with come
[1:50:07] on oh that makes me want to
[1:50:10] shout I came out of it many of us had to
[1:50:14] come out of that Pentecostal shock even
[1:50:16] while we were in this message we had a
[1:50:18] lot of domination uh domineering
[1:50:21] preachers that that that that had so
[1:50:23] intermingled the the the the the the
[1:50:26] word and opinion together but what we're
[1:50:29] doing today is we're saying God I refuse
[1:50:32] to accept anything in my heart but Thy
[1:50:39] word
[1:50:41] amen that's the reason I I I hope I hope
[1:50:45] I hope I hope I I I know I'm a leader
[1:50:48] and a Leader's got to have a strong I
[1:50:50] you got to have a strong personality but
[1:50:53] folks my personality ain't going to get
[1:50:54] you nowhere no personality in of any
[1:50:58] preacher in this church will get us
[1:51:00] anywhere come on there's only one way
[1:51:04] and that is lining ourselves up with the
[1:51:06] word of the Lord lining ourselves up
[1:51:09] with this message of the hour we are
[1:51:10] pulling away from the Shu we are pulling
[1:51:14] away from that denominational thinking
[1:51:18] and we are saying Lord
[1:51:20] let your life live in me well bless the
[1:51:24] name of the
[1:51:26] Lord amen I love him I love him I I I I

[1:57:56] hearts everything about
[1:58:00] us brother brandom would tell
[1:58:03] us that the
[1:58:05] lamb must be handled with Clean Hands
[1:58:11] yeah and this is so important as
[1:58:16] we are dealing
[1:58:19] [Music]
[1:58:20] of course in our personal walk
[1:58:23] we for that lamb that
[1:58:27] word the realities of God has to be in a
[1:58:30] pure
[1:58:33] heart we can't be hypocritical about it
[1:58:35] we've got
[1:58:37] to we got to keep sin
[1:58:40] now number
[1:58:46] two the way we deal with one another I I
[1:58:51] can't
[1:58:52] have I can't keep the presence of God
[1:58:54] with me and have
[1:58:58] a against
[1:59:01] Kaye Kaye can't keep the presence of God
[1:59:04] in her have ought against her
[1:59:07] [Music]
[1:59:10] mama we we can't do that we got to
[1:59:15] keep the
[1:59:17] lamb in a holy clean pure
[1:59:23] [Music]
[1:59:26] place I think I think there's if there's
[1:59:29] ever a time to let the genuine life
[1:59:32] which is the charity the
[1:59:37] Capstone to rest upon
[1:59:41] us it's
[1:59:44] today let that Holy power of
[1:59:48] God
[1:59:50] is it a fight you bet
[1:59:54] you Satan's where he going to fight you
[1:59:56] at as I've always said he's going to
[1:59:57] fight you in your love life s he's going
[1:59:59] to fight
[2:00:00] you but I want to tell
[2:00:03] you wounded
[2:00:05] Hearts God knew wounded Hearts were
[2:00:08] going to be there so you know what he
[2:00:11] done that lamb that was born on
[2:00:13] Christmas
[2:00:15] day or not on Christmas day but that
[2:00:18] first Christmas
[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:21] I hate to even call it that but brother
[2:00:23] brandham did on my quote
[2:00:25] so that that that that lamb that
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:32] came came not for us to sing Christmas
[2:00:35] carols but he came to shed his blood for
[2:00:39] all the wounded
[2:00:41] hearts and he says he's come to bind up
[2:00:44] the
[2:00:45] broken he's come to bind up the
[2:00:48] wounded now if you believe and recognize
[2:00:52] that
[2:00:53] lamb you can go to
[2:00:56] him and that lamb will wash your
[2:01:00] heart it'll
[2:01:05] happen I I still believe today that he
[2:01:08] that he that he's very much alive
[2:01:11] identifying him where he is is so
[2:01:16] important and what I've tried to show
[2:01:18] you tonight
[2:01:20] I I've tried to identify where he's at
[2:01:22] he's not in the
[2:01:24] Shu he's right here his word living here
[2:01:29] and as that word is coming into that
[2:01:31] heart amen there's going to be a lot of
[2:01:33] you that God's just going to make sure
[2:01:34] it comes out of
[2:01:37] you and remember remember if you say oh
[2:01:41] I could be a better me if there was a if
[2:01:44] there was a better them well remember
[2:01:47] just remember
[2:01:49] the very first person to follow on the
[2:01:51] human planet was living in Paradise with
[2:01:54] no
[2:01:55] sin and they fell yeah so we can't use
[2:01:59] those
[2:02:01] excuses uh whoever put that the other
[2:02:04] day uh had sent something to me you
[2:02:08] can't blame the uh whatever it was you
[2:02:10] can't blame the preacher you can't blame
[2:02:12] mama you can't blame daddy you got to
[2:02:14] look in the mirror and blame yourself
[2:02:15] something like that I think I put it on
[2:02:16] the on on the chat there
[2:02:19] and and that's true we we we got to look
[2:02:21] and say God this is a personal
[2:02:24] relationship with me and you and I want
[2:02:27] your word to be birthed in me it's the
[2:02:29] season it's the time this is the time
