[40:28] protection and and um amen and matters
[40:33] of fact why don't y'all be seated we we
[40:35] just uh we thought we would share a few
[40:38] pictures of the uh of of the fire and
[40:42] and
[40:43] um this this is the excitement for those
[40:46] that was just doing it by phone and um
[40:49] so the the the fires had had come
[40:53] in um in the pastor back behind brother
[40:58] uh Michael's house and this is actually
[41:00] in another man's pasture and so they
[41:03] they had brought in a a bulldozer and
[41:06] was uh digging trenches and then Patrick
[41:10] was uh coming behind with a tractor and
[41:14] I don't know if we if if we got but the
[41:17] fire just kept on coming and um so the
[41:21] brothers were out there with their
[41:23] buckets and four-wheeler and and water
[41:26] and and and uh uh fighting that fire and
[41:33] um and so it you know they they
[41:37] just they had kept on coming and and and
[41:40] the fire would just would you know would
[41:43] jump and and and and go over them at one
[41:45] time they were um the brothers were were
[41:48] surrounded the fire came all the way
[41:50] around them now this here is on the home
[41:53] front this is this is my brother
[41:54] Michael's house and so um
[41:58] uh go back to that other picture there
[42:00] brother uh Patrick brought that tractor
[42:03] over and um was was clearing all of that
[42:06] grass through there and uh making a a
[42:10] long line through there and and um of
[42:13] course there was a few of us they don't
[42:14] have the best water pressure so we're
[42:17] there with water um helping where we can
[42:20] you know and um so there's that there's
[42:24] their
[42:25] house and
[42:28] um
[42:29] uh there's you know continuing working
[42:32] around around there you can see the
[42:36] smoke all in the area I mean these all
[42:38] of these brothers I'll have everyone
[42:39] stand up uh here in a minute we had a we
[42:41] had a we had our own fire crew out there
[42:44] amen and um uh they're they're out there
[42:47] mowing you you'll see I think it might
[42:49] have been on that last picture there
[42:51] where they were mowing they had
[42:52] lawnmowers out there trying to uh mow
[42:54] down that brush out there in the pasture
[42:57] and
[42:59] um and so we dug trenches these young
[43:03] men dug trenches of them and and then
[43:05] some then the other brothers come in and
[43:08] and and was
[43:09] helping and
[43:11] um this
[43:14] is this is the
[43:16] water on the houses and you didn't know
[43:19] that was going to be go in on the video
[43:21] did you so there are some of the guys uh
[43:24] we didn't we didn't take get get a get a
[43:27] group picture but those guys had just
[43:28] came back
[43:29] in and um so we thought we thought life
[43:33] was good and and um we were all patting
[43:37] each other on the back and job well done
[43:41] and and um actually went to go get us
[43:45] something to
[43:46] eat and we came back and from the road
[43:51] it was glowing it there it was glowing
[43:57] and um we got this we got a message uh
[44:00] Sister Amy she you know pray pray pray
[44:03] Patrick is
[44:04] trapped we come we come through there
[44:07] and I mean it is blade right there with
[44:08] their intersection it is fire and uh so
[44:12] we we we go back in there and um their
[44:17] house is
[44:19] surrounded with
[44:22] fire and you you can see the glow on all
[44:26] the way around
[44:27] [Music]
[44:29] and
[44:31] um and the Lord
[44:35] protected that
[44:38] home the the the out building there was
[44:41] on fire there were some trees that kept
[44:43] catching fire and U so we had put we had
[44:47] put the fire out watch those Embers
[44:49] blowing it was so windy 60 MPH gust
[44:53] though that that's what kept the fire
[44:55] spreading and so so uh
[44:58] ultimately uh it would just keep going
[45:01] and and and keep
[45:03] blowing and
[45:06] um and it was just it it was
[45:09] crazy so this is the next morning I
[45:13] jumped on the
[45:15] house you can see it's all charred out
[45:18] [Music]
[45:19] there and
[45:21] um it's still smoldering if you can sit
[45:24] back there in the back it's all
[45:26] smoldering back there in the hills
[45:29] and and
[45:31] um but you know what the Lord kept that
[45:36] from from
[45:47] coming and
[45:50] so you can see where Patrick where you
[45:53] where you had done that deal there it
[45:54] didn't it didn't jump on the other side
[45:56] there it just went on
[45:57] around and so putting that putting uh
[46:01] doing that with the tractor did keep
[46:03] that fire from coming over and getting
[46:05] that building and then it just worked
[46:06] its way on around and um but you say
[46:10] well it was just the green grass there I
[46:12] want to tell you that wind was blowing
[46:13] so there were sparks
[46:15] flying
[46:17] everywhere brother Joe was out there and
[46:19] he I was I I wasn't out there in the
[46:22] main in the main deal as I say we were
[46:24] we were doing we were preparing around
[46:26] the house there
[46:28] just in case it came but the guys were
[46:31] out there uh they actually saved their
[46:35] neighbor's house Mike
[46:37] um I don't know what
[46:41] aters
[46:43] haen and um uh they they were all out
[46:47] there fighting and it and and saved his
[46:49] his home and we had thought that it it
[46:52] stopped there but it jumped and uh came
[46:55] on over
[46:57] and so um so you
[47:00] can you can see um and there was there
[47:03] was a lot of Cedars a lot of Cedars
[47:06] around and and um so we're just we're
[47:10] just thankful so uh I wonder if the fire
[47:13] crew would would want to stand up here
[47:15] everyone that was all involved in
[47:16] working Heen we want to give you a hand
[47:18] clap for coming
[47:21] over yeah come on stand up
[47:29] so we we appreciate everyone all jumping
[47:32] in there and and um what I what I was
[47:36] fixing to say was brother brother Joe
[47:39] had called and said that U he said it's
[47:41] it it's just amazing he said it was it
[47:44] was just a coming and then that wind
[47:46] started turning around the other way and
[47:48] blowing it the other direction and and
[47:50] and and and just put it out and and you
[47:53] know just just things like that and I I
[47:55] believe the Lord heard our prayer
[47:59] we we seen
[48:02] um um you know as as as we as I was
[48:06] going towards uh
[48:07] Cleveland there was a lot of green just
[48:10] Green Yard grass that was totally
[48:12] charred uh uh so so the Lord you know
[48:16] it's just isn't it isn't it so wonderful
[48:19] that the Lord is so mindful to his
[48:22] people I know things you know in one
[48:25] sense brother Michael could have
[48:27] probably got him a new house but in
[48:28] another
[48:29] sense all all of the childhood memories
[48:32] and the pictures and the you know those
[48:35] things are precious and and for the Lord
[48:38] to to do that was was just wonderful and
[48:42] we thank the Lord for that and so we I
[48:46] thought I would share that here this
[48:48] morning
[48:50] amen and um and so we uh I'm just glad
[48:55] to belong to the to to the family of God
[48:58] Amen uh brother uh you should have seen
[49:02] everyone's eyes beat red even the next
[49:05] morning everyone that I seen their eyes
[49:08] were all puffy and swollen and and uh
[49:12] even Josh had he he went into the doctor
[49:14] yesterday and he was throwing up all
[49:17] night and and uh got a little bit too
[49:20] much of that smoke in his lungs and and
[49:23] uh and so he's not feeling even the best
[49:26] this morning but but but he's he's but
[49:28] he's wasn't that a beautiful song this
[49:32] morning I love that song
[49:35] Amen so anyways um all right if you want
[49:38] to stand to your feet and we'll we'll
[49:40] turn to the book of Deuteronomy the
[49:42] second
[49:45] chapter and uh we'll read here at the at
[49:48] the first uh verse read the first three
[49:51] [Music]
[49:54] verses and um
[49:59] this will be just
[50:02] a um you know maybe a simple thought
[50:05] here this
[50:06] morning
[50:08] um but I I want to take a a text out of
[50:13] these especially the third verse there
[50:15] but it says then we
[50:18] turned and took our journey into the
[50:20] Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as
[50:23] the Lord spake unto me and we compass
[50:26] Mount SE many
[50:29] days and the Lord spake unto me saying
[50:33] you have compassed this mountain long
[50:36] enough turn
[50:38] northward and I want to minister this
[50:41] morning we have compassed this mountain
[50:44] long
[50:45] enough let's go to the Lord in
[50:48] prayer father we have been so
[50:52] honored to see what you have done for
[50:55] your people yet again
[50:58] and Lord how that you have spared not
[51:00] only brother Michael's sister Amy's home
[51:03] but Lord
[51:05] also the Lancaster's home Lord and and
[51:09] father even as they evacuated and the
[51:12] the fire came up within a half mile 3/4
[51:16] of a mile from their home destroyed many
[51:20] homes but Lord you protected theirs and
[51:24] Lord altto together Lord I and also
[51:27] thinking of of even brother Jonah's home
[51:30] and and his brother Caleb's Lord and how
[51:34] good you have been to us Lord father we
[51:38] we not we don't take that
[51:41] lightly Lord we're thankful for the
[51:43] brothers and thankful for their
[51:44] willingness to help Lord
[51:48] but ultimately if you're not with us it
[51:51] it does not much good Lord and we thank
[51:56] you for your blessings and keeping us
[51:58] safe and but Lord Here We Stand today
[52:02] and we ask Lord that your Holy Spirit
[52:05] would be among us here this morning and
[52:08] that you would speak to our hearts Lord
[52:11] we've got some babies that aren't
[52:12] feeling well and I pray father that you
[52:15] would heal them and make them whole and
[52:19] touch those Lord and sister titha with a
[52:22] fever and the the different ones who
[52:25] weren't feeling well I pray that you'll
[52:27] be with them Father we just ask Lord now
[52:31] that you would speak to us in the name
[52:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church
[52:36] say
[52:38] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[52:43] seated I as I think about this uh
[52:48] thought this morning we have compassed
[52:51] this mountain long
[52:53] enough and and just a simple
[52:57] thoughts and knowing the hours that
[53:00] we're living in that we are truly in the
[53:04] in the last of the last of
[53:07] times and uh brother Malachi it's good
[53:09] to see you amen today and uh seen you
[53:13] but I forgot to recognize you amen good
[53:15] to have you this
[53:17] morning but um you know uh
[53:21] we there there is a there is an urgency
[53:24] and there is a a a a Time brother
[53:26] Brandon would preach sermons amen uh
[53:30] about the builders not being able to
[53:33] turn not being able to make the corner
[53:37] amen and as God makes the corner uh if
[53:41] God's if the plans say to turn the
[53:43] corner then we want to turn the corner
[53:46] When God Says time is over and he has
[53:49] declared that time shall be no more
[53:52] that's already been spoken amen and we
[53:56] have seen since
[53:58] 1963 that the
[54:00] Declaration amen uh that God had spoke
[54:04] in in the in the message of indictment
[54:08] amen the kingdoms of this world have
[54:10] Begin to Fall they have begin to fall to
[54:15] the ground and so we understand that we
[54:18] are living in an hour that we are
[54:22] preparing not to go through another
[54:24] church age not to go back around the
[54:28] mountain again but we are here looking
[54:32] and and and the the the amen the the
[54:35] prophet even uh uh preached a message on
[54:38] this same scripture here and and he
[54:41] titled it turn northward something was
[54:44] fixing to take place the third pull was
[54:47] fixing to come into effect amen but
[54:50] today so many years after the opening of
[54:54] the seals I am declaring
[54:56] it's time for us to take this amen this
[55:00] powerful sword and let's go northward
[55:05] let's Proclaim can you say Amen now when
[55:08] this was proclaimed amen it it would
[55:11] have been easy for Israel to to think
[55:15] amen that the promised
[55:17] land was just around the corner they
[55:20] they would have a hard time believing
[55:23] that the promised landine would be 40
[55:26] years away amen it it was only I I I
[55:30] believe somewhere 300 miles between
[55:33] Egypt and and and and the go or and the
[55:36] promised land amen you could drive that
[55:39] from Egypt uh you know to Israel in
[55:42] about 15 hours you could amen today with
[55:46] with in modern in modern time amen they
[55:49] say that you could walk it in about four
[55:51] to five weeks amen but but you see uh uh
[55:55] because
[55:57] Israel um had they they in the in the
[56:02] wilderness of
[56:04] testing they they couldn't quite catch
[56:08] the
[56:09] revelation of who they were they never
[56:12] could see themselves as the possessors
[56:16] of that land and God could not take them
[56:19] into that land until they seen
[56:22] themselves as the possessors because if
[56:25] they didn't see them themselves as the
[56:27] possessors they were for sure going to
[56:28] get slaughtered amen by the Giants in
[56:31] that land amen that's right a and and so
[56:35] amen God was good to them God was always
[56:39] so uh uh kind and amen and he would work
[56:43] his his his word and his will through uh
[56:47] uh throughout the Wilderness they they
[56:49] came through the Red Sea and amen and
[56:52] and they were dancing in the spirit and
[56:55] shouting and praising God and amen all
[56:59] of their their slave masters were dead
[57:01] the Chariots were amen were in the
[57:04] bottom of the sea the amen uh Pharaoh's
[57:07] Army had all disappeared before them oh
[57:11] what a what a great time that they had
[57:14] they amen they were they were blessed
[57:17] you see amen every time that they had a
[57:20] need amen they they knew that God had
[57:23] given them a prophet and they had seen
[57:25] the Passover Lamb uh that had been given
[57:28] to them for the sin the angel of the
[57:30] Lord was their was their God the prophet
[57:33] was their instructor they they they felt
[57:37] good amen and but but Israel had a
[57:41] problem they served God on an emotional
[57:46] level and not by divine revelation they
[57:50] served God Amen based upon amen all the
[57:55] work wonder ful works of God but the
[57:58] next time they got in a pinch amen their
[58:02] emotions got the best of them and they
[58:05] would say oh would to God we would have
[58:07] stayed in Egypt oh have you brought us
[58:09] out here to die oh Moses who do you
[58:12] think you are there's other great men
[58:14] around here amen what do you mean you're
[58:16] the you're the prophet of God they were
[58:19] always looking at things on the
[58:22] emotional level and they could not catch
[58:26] a revelation that they are no longer
[58:30] slaves but that they are the possessors
[58:34] of a land amen and if we're going to be
[58:37] a possessor of of any promise of God
[58:40] Amen we're going to have to see
[58:42] ourselves as the possessors we're going
[58:45] to have to walk into that land not
[58:47] hoping we're going to amen win not
[58:49] hoping we're going to be able to
[58:52] overcome but we've got to know that
[58:54] greater is he that is with in us than he
[58:57] that is within that world that God is
[59:00] with us can you say
[59:03] amen amen hallelujah you see the grace
[59:08] had brought him through amen Moses wrote
[59:11] a song of Victory and Miriam led the
[59:13] sisters in a dance and amen they were
[59:16] beating the tambourines while singing
[59:19] the songs of Victory the the task
[59:21] Masters were dead but then the next day
[59:24] there they were complaining and and and
[59:26] and thinking oh amen I I I I just don't
[59:31] know I I I don't know if we can make it
[59:33] I I don't know if we'll be well praise
[59:35] the Lord can you say Amen you see amen
[59:39] you God has got a promise for us how
[59:43] many believes that
[59:44] today God's got a promise amen now
[59:48] brother Brandon would say that the
[59:50] Wilderness was the Wilderness of
[59:54] testings Hallelujah
[59:56] amen the
[59:58] Wilderness was the testing grounds for
[1:00:01] the sons of God Amen now they and and I
[1:00:06] I I want us to to to really think of
[1:00:09] that because as I'm talking about Israel
[1:00:12] for a few moments here I want you to
[1:00:15] catch where we have been in the church
[1:00:18] ages we've gone through seven Church
[1:00:21] ages that have been wandering around in
[1:00:23] the wilderness we have seen the
[1:00:26] supernatural presence of God Amen God
[1:00:29] raised up Great Men the supernatural was
[1:00:31] was was an incredible thing but they
[1:00:34] would go down Generation by generation

[1:02:28] but they could not see themselves as the
[1:02:31] possessors of the promises of God Amen
[1:02:34] they would question the God who brought
[1:02:36] them out amen why have you brought us
[1:02:38] out and they would denominate around the
[1:02:42] uh emotional reasoning instead of
[1:02:45] walking by faith in the word of God Amen

[1:03:24] wilderness thinking they knew where they
[1:03:25] were going but it was nothing but a

[1:05:09] the Lord and his strength and his
[1:05:11] wonderful Works which he hath done for
[1:05:14] he established a testimony in Jacob and
[1:05:16] appointed a law in Israel which he had
[1:05:19] which he commanded our fathers that they
[1:05:21] should make known to their children that
[1:05:23] the generation to come might know them

[1:05:48] children that they might set their hope
[1:05:51] in God and not forget the works of God
[1:05:54] but keep his Commandments and not be as
[1:05:56] their fathers a stubborn and rebellious
[1:05:59] Generation generation that set not their
[1:06:01] heart a right whose Spirit was not
[1:06:04] setfast with God the children of Ephraim
[1:06:07] being armed and carrying bows and turned
[1:06:10] back in the day of battle they kept not
[1:06:12] the Covenant of God and refused to walk
[1:06:14] in his law and forget his works and his
[1:06:17] Wonders that he had showed them
[1:06:19] marvelous things he did in the sight of
[1:06:21] their fathers in the land of Egypt and
[1:06:24] in the field of Zone he divided the sea
[1:06:27] and caused them to pass through he made
[1:06:29] the waters to stand as an Heap in the
[1:06:32] daytime also he led them with a cloud
[1:06:34] and all the night with a light of fire
[1:06:37] he clav the rocks in the wilderness and
[1:06:40] gave them drink has out of the great
[1:06:42] depths he brought streams out also of
[1:06:46] The Rock and caused Waters to run down
[1:06:50] like Rivers they sinned yet more against
[1:06:53] him by Proke uh provoking the most high
[1:06:56] in the wilderness and they tempted God
[1:06:58] in their heart by asking meat for their
[1:07:01] lust and yay they spake against God and
[1:07:03] they said can God furnish a table in the
[1:07:06] wilderness behold he smoked the rock
[1:07:08] that the waters gushed out and the
[1:07:10] streams overflowed can he give bread
[1:07:12] also can he provide flesh for his people
[1:07:16] therefore the Lord heard this and was
[1:07:18] wroth so a fire was kindled against
[1:07:21] Jacob anger also come against Israel
[1:07:24] because they believed not in God and
[1:07:27] trusted not in his salvation though he
[1:07:29] had commanded the clouds from above and
[1:07:32] opened the doors of heaven and had
[1:07:34] rained down Mana upon them to eat and
[1:07:37] had given them the corn of Heaven man
[1:07:39] did eat Angels food and he sent them
[1:07:42] meat to the full he caused an East Wind
[1:07:45] to blow in the heaven by his power he
[1:07:48] brought in the south wind he rained
[1:07:50] flesh also upon them as dust and
[1:07:53] feathered fowls like as the sand of the
[1:07:55] sea he let it fall in the midst of their
[1:07:58] camp and round about their habitations
[1:08:01] so they did eat and they were fill for
[1:08:04] he gave them their own desire and they
[1:08:06] were not estranged from the lust but
[1:08:09] while their meat was yet in their mouth
[1:08:11] the wrath of God come upon them and slew
[1:08:14] the fattest of them and smoke down the
[1:08:17] chosen of the children of Israel for all
[1:08:20] this they sin still and believe not for
[1:08:23] his wondrous Works therefore their day
[1:08:26] did he consume in vanity in their years
[1:08:28] and trouble when he slew them and they
[1:08:32] then they sought him and they returned
[1:08:34] and inquired early after God and they
[1:08:36] remembered that God was their Rock and
[1:08:39] the high God their redeemer nevertheless
[1:08:42] they did flatter him with their mouth
[1:08:44] and they lied unto him with their
[1:08:46] tongues and their heart was not right
[1:08:48] with him neither were they steadfast in
[1:08:51] his Covenant but he being full of
[1:08:53] compassion forgave their iniquities
[1:08:55] destroyed them not yay many time turned
[1:08:59] his anger away did not stir up his wrath
[1:09:02] for he remembered that they were but
[1:09:04] flesh and wind that passeth away that
[1:09:07] cometh not again how of they did provoke
[1:09:10] him in the wilderness and grieve him in
[1:09:12] the desert yay they turned back and
[1:09:15] tempted God and limited the Holy One of
[1:09:18] Israel they remembered not his hand nor
[1:09:22] the day when he delivered them from the
[1:09:24] enemy how he was how he had wrought his
[1:09:27] signs in Egypt his wonders in the field
[1:09:29] of Zone and had turned their Rivers into
[1:09:32] blood and their floods that they could
[1:09:34] not drink and he sent diverse sorts of
[1:09:37] flies among them which devoured them and
[1:09:40] frogs which destroyed them he gave also
[1:09:43] their increase into the caterpillar and
[1:09:45] their labor into the Locust he destroyed
[1:09:47] their vines with hail and and sycamore
[1:09:50] trees with frost he gave up their cattle
[1:09:53] all to the hell and their flocks to the
[1:09:55] Thunderbolt he cast upon the fierceness
[1:09:58] of his anger and wrath and indignation
[1:10:00] and Trouble by sending evil angels among
[1:10:03] them he made a way to his anger he
[1:10:06] spared not their soul from death but
[1:10:09] gave their life over to pestilence amen
[1:10:12] he smot all the firstborn uh in Egypt
[1:10:15] and the chief of their strength in the
[1:10:17] Tabernacles of ham but made his own
[1:10:21] people go forth like sheep and gathered
[1:10:25] and guided them in the wilderness like a
[1:10:28] flock and he led them on safely so that
[1:10:32] they feared not but the sea overwhelmed
[1:10:35] their enemies you can see now what God
[1:10:37] is is is saying here now God's got a
[1:10:41] vision God's got something in his mind
[1:10:45] he's wanting to take them out of
[1:10:49] slavery he's wanting to take them well
[1:10:52] out of Slavery to your emotions out out
[1:10:55] of slavery Amen to your flesh out of
[1:10:58] Slavery to your mind out of SL well can
[1:11:01] you say Amen he's wanting to take them
[1:11:05] out of slavery and make them amen
[1:11:09] possessors and he wants to be well can
[1:11:12] you say amen amen but you see Israel was
[1:11:16] serving God on an emotional basis it was
[1:11:19] ups and downs because amen after all
[1:11:23] amen when the when the was done they got
[1:11:26] hungry again when the Mana was done they
[1:11:30] got hungry again when the water had had
[1:11:33] had you know when it dried up they got
[1:11:36] thir well praise the Lord but you see
[1:11:38] they never could catch the
[1:11:41] Revelation that God has called me I was
[1:11:45] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:11:48] world and there is nothing that this
[1:11:51] Wilderness can do to hinder God's
[1:11:55] purpose in my life and let me tell you
[1:11:58] today there is nothing that your trial
[1:12:01] your situation amen your
[1:12:05] circumstance can do to hinder God's word
[1:12:09] in your
[1:12:13] life as
[1:12:15] long as you can believe him
[1:12:19] hallelujah
[1:12:20] amen now we understand that is Israel
[1:12:25] was a
[1:12:26] type amen Israel was a type of of the
[1:12:31] church now they were just simply a
[1:12:33] natural people that God rose up to show
[1:12:38] what the church was going to be Church
[1:12:41] age after church age after church age
[1:12:44] after church age but there was going to
[1:12:46] come a people that God was going to say

[1:12:52] circled this
[1:12:54] mountain long
[1:12:56] enough you have circled it you have been

[1:13:14] Judgment center of the area amen right
[1:13:18] there God was going to judge them and he
[1:13:21] says but I'm not going to take that
[1:13:22] whole congregation amen who has been
[1:13:25] belly aching and crying can't believe me
[1:13:27] for amen for hardly anything over and
[1:13:30] over and over I prove myself what can

[1:13:35] a possessor amen they're too busy
[1:13:38] looking at this and that amen those
[1:13:40] people will not go over amen so what did
[1:13:43] he do he rose up some preachers and they
[1:13:46] went over into that land 10 of them came
[1:13:49] back and said we can't do it amen and
[1:13:53] two million people says you're right we
[1:13:55] can't do it but there were two preachers
[1:13:57] that came back and said it is everything
[1:14:00] that God promised it is well praise the
[1:14:03] Lord everything the prophet said it is
[1:14:09] over

[1:14:23] love to hear I love to hear a song
[1:14:25] leader say I I I don't have to be
[1:14:27] careful about quoting what the prophet
[1:14:30] said I I I'm glad to hear parents amen
[1:14:33] that'll stand up on the prophet's word
[1:14:36] and say we believe what God
[1:14:42] Said can you say

[1:14:52] Vision was to take them from the land
[1:14:55] land of bondage and to place them as
[1:14:58] possessors in their own
[1:15:00] land but there's a generation that had
[1:15:03] risen up that could not believe it but
[1:15:06] just because and this is where I I want
[1:15:08] you to really look at this there is a
[1:15:10] church within a
[1:15:11] church there is a nation within a nation

[1:15:22] those ages that was sealed under the
[1:15:25] message of that age
[1:15:28] Hallelujah in the in the middle of the
[1:15:32] Temptation God had a people that were
[1:15:36] going to possess I I begin to think as I
[1:15:40] as I looked there in proverbs 30 And1

[1:15:45] generation that curseth their father and
[1:15:49] does not bless their
[1:15:51] mother there is a generation that are

[1:15:58] filthiness there is a generation oh how
[1:16:01] lofty are their eyes and their eyelids
[1:16:04] are lifted up there is a generation

[1:24:32] as God says it's the truth say
[1:24:35] Alon I've always thought of the little
[1:24:38] poem in my school book when I was a
[1:24:40] little boy up here on the road many of
[1:24:43] you men and women of my age remembers it
[1:24:45] Sail on Sail On and On when Christopher
[1:24:48] Columbus was given ships by the queen of
[1:24:52] Spain because in heart he saw a vision
[1:24:55] that the world was round and he had
[1:24:57] hardly a way he could prove it he had
[1:25:00] nothing to do it with but he was a man
[1:25:02] of
[1:25:04] vision and he believed it when the ship
[1:25:07] was given to him with a bunch of
[1:25:09] prisoners and cowards that was his
[1:25:12] church members a bunch of pullbacks a
[1:25:15] bunch that was discouraged and tried to
[1:25:18] discouraging just a a little while
[1:25:20] longer and we'll drop off the world a
[1:25:23] sea will r a a serpent Will Rise From
[1:25:25] the Bottom of the Sea and wrap these
[1:25:27] little ships and pull it to the bottom
[1:25:29] and now say Brave Rover say what will
[1:25:32] you say he said Sail on Sail on Sail On
[1:25:38] and On God give us men in the church
[1:25:41] like that I don't care what the
[1:25:43] scientific world says I don't care what
[1:25:44] the denominational world says I Take God
[1:25:47] at his word and sail on Sail on until
[1:25:50] you pass the barrier we used to in in in
[1:25:52] the old church here we sing that little
[1:25:54] song like this I've crossed the
[1:25:56] separating line I've left the World
[1:25:58] Behind if there was ever a time that the
[1:26:00] church needs to step across that line
[1:26:03] that separates you between faith and
[1:26:05] unbelief by sight and looking at the
[1:26:07] Unseen by faith amen it's now that's
[1:26:10] when you leave everything behind you
[1:26:13] every care every worry everything that
[1:26:16] says you can't be a Christian i've
[1:26:18] smoked too long I've drank too long

[1:26:32] Scarlet you once pass that line of
[1:26:35] barrier of the devil trying to torment
[1:26:38] you and saying you can't do it you can't
[1:26:41] do it and say I can do it for Jesus said
[1:26:45] whosoever will let him come and drink
[1:26:48] from the water of the Fountain of Life
[1:26:51] freely leave that behind
[1:26:59] when you people are that are sick has
[1:27:01] play out through prayer line after
[1:27:02] prayer line you've been prayed for and
[1:27:04] you've been dock to doctors you've done
[1:27:06] everything and still death stays at your
[1:27:08] door when you get to a place where you
[1:27:12] can say I don't care what the doctor
[1:27:14] says I don't care what this scientific
[1:27:17] world says Jesus Christ made me a
[1:27:19] promise pass that barrier of vibrations
[1:27:23] to your your soul that you're free oh
[1:27:27] someone shout hallelujah somebody say
[1:27:29] I'm free I'm free I'm not asking you if
[1:27:34] you feel like you are free I said say
[1:27:36] you're free because God says you're
[1:27:41] free say you're free cuz it's in his
[1:27:45] word that you are free amen it doesn't
[1:27:49] matter what the devil says I will cross
[1:27:53] that b barrier of
[1:27:56] unbelief
[1:27:57] Hallelujah can you say
[1:28:00] amen amen he says you he says now amen
[1:28:05] there's not one thing that'll shake you

[1:28:11] pull pit you'll never turn to look to
[1:28:13] the the that way no more you'll be
[1:28:16] looking this way so you're free from
[1:28:18] them things you say the day days of
[1:28:20] Miracles has passed there's no such a
[1:28:22] thing as Divine Healing you can't get
[1:28:23] wet your case is too bad Sail
[1:28:27] on Sail on above it climb the walls
[1:28:31] Yonder until all is free every rope and
[1:28:35] every feder has been cut loose every
[1:28:39] vibration has been left in the back and
[1:28:41] you're free and you're free
[1:28:45] indeed oh bless the
[1:28:47] Lord now amen Jesus Christ God's son
[1:28:52] said in the church for you people amen
[1:28:55] for such things as this he sent first
[1:28:58] apostles then after he sent prophets and
[1:29:00] teachers and pastors and evangelist to
[1:29:03] confirm his word to prove that he is uh
[1:29:06] to to prove that he is some great
[1:29:07] teacher I don't mean he has to be a PhD
[1:29:11] you might know less than the Bible a
[1:29:15] about the Bible than a child that's
[1:29:17] still in his adolescence Jesus knowed
[1:29:20] more about scriptures at 12 years old
[1:29:22] than all the Pharisees did or the learn
[1:29:24] sages so you see it doesn't take an
[1:29:27] intellectual mind it takes a surrendered
[1:29:30] heart to the will of God if Jesus Christ
[1:29:34] God's son promised this Bible that he
[1:29:36] had saved to the uttermost if he
[1:29:39] promised the things that I do shall you
[1:29:41] do also I'll be with you to the end of
[1:29:44] the world and if that same Jesus could
[1:29:47] come tonight and take us into his
[1:29:49] control we could set ourselves from not
[1:29:53] thinking of how it's going to be done
[1:29:55] but looking at the Unseen to The God Who
[1:29:58] has promised it can you shout
[1:30:02] hallelujah amen the unveiling of
[1:30:06] God brother brandham says oh break those

[1:30:20] your King's Daughters act like it live
[1:30:24] like it break every Veil no matter what
[1:30:27] the PHD and lld says if it's contrary to
[1:30:30] that bre that Bible break through that
[1:30:33] Veil amen for we've crossed that Riven
[1:30:36] Veil we're on the other side now on the
[1:30:39] other side and you will see if you just
[1:30:42] do that and break those old traditions
[1:30:45] and things and come to him you'll see
[1:30:48] him standing the mighty conqueror the

[1:31:14] matter all of the unbelief of that
[1:31:20] generation it did not matter that the
[1:31:22] four million
[1:31:24] could not accept
[1:31:26] it what did
[1:31:29] matter is there was an
[1:31:33] elect that
[1:31:36] did and it doesn't matter what the G
[1:31:39] this generation says or doesn't say it
[1:31:42] doesn't
[1:31:44] matter it doesn't matter their forms of
[1:31:46] worship it doesn't matter one thing or
[1:31:48] Another We're not in
[1:31:51] form we're going north
[1:31:56] we've compassed this Old Mountain long
[1:31:59] enough Church
[1:32:01] attendance coming to church every
[1:32:04] service doing our
[1:32:06] thing well Satan loves
[1:32:10] form Satan loves a formal powerless
[1:32:17] religion but I'm sorry
[1:32:21] folks this is not my predes destinated
[1:32:24] Place God says I'm taking you to a land
[1:32:26] of
[1:32:28] promise I know there's going to be
[1:32:30] mountains there and I know why God is
[1:32:32] testing me here I know why God is
[1:32:35] testing me he's testing you with your
[1:32:37] amen W with this and with that with this
[1:32:40] just to see how you're going to handle
[1:32:41] it because he knows that when you get
[1:32:44] out of that Wilderness you're going to
[1:32:46] have to have a faith that is going to be
[1:32:48] steadfast and you're going to have to
[1:32:50] believe God for big things there there's
[1:32:53] going to be big mountains there's going
[1:32:55] to be big giants there's going to be
[1:32:57] amen things telling you that you don't
[1:32:59] belong there but if you know that you're
[1:33:02] the possessor and you've got your heart
[1:33:05] set on that Promised Land it does not
[1:33:08] matter how big the giant greater is he
[1:33:12] that is with me than that giant that I'm
[1:33:15] staring
[1:33:17] down not looking at it no more I'm not
[1:33:20] not this Wilderness has taught me it's
[1:33:24] brought something through me amen I've
[1:33:28] got one
[1:33:30] intention and that's to see God
[1:33:32] manifested in my
[1:33:34] flesh
[1:33:37] now can you say
[1:33:39] amen
[1:33:41] amen I
[1:33:43] think
[1:33:45] as I look here at
[1:33:49] the at at
[1:33:51] another place where
[1:33:54] Israel was in their Promised
[1:33:57] Land but yet
[1:33:59] Satan was doing everything he could to
[1:34:03] hinder them how many remembers the
[1:34:06] midianites coming
[1:34:10] and that the scripture says matters of
[1:34:12] fact I'll just read it here to you it's
[1:34:14] I think it's judges
[1:34:19] 6 judges 6 and2 and the Hand of Midian
[1:34:22] prevailed against Israel because of the
[1:34:24] the midianites the children of Israel
[1:34:26] made them dens which are in the
[1:34:27] mountains and caves and strongholds so
[1:34:30] it was when Israel had sown that the
[1:34:33] midianites came up and the amalekites
[1:34:35] and the children of isra of the East
[1:34:37] even they came up against them and they
[1:34:39] encamped against them and destroyed the
[1:34:41] increase of the earth till till Thou
[1:34:44] come unto Gaza and left no substance for
[1:34:48] Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor ass they
[1:34:51] come up with their cattle and their
[1:34:52] tents and they came as grasshoppers for
[1:34:55] the multitude for both they and their
[1:34:57] camels were without number and they
[1:34:59] entered into the land to destroy it and
[1:35:02] Israel was greatly impoverished because
[1:35:04] the midianites and the children of
[1:35:06] Israel Cried unto the
[1:35:09] Lord and it came to pass when the
[1:35:11] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[1:35:13] because of the
[1:35:16] midianites God says well you're
[1:35:21] finished God says well you're in your
[1:35:25] land I can't do nothing for you the Lord
[1:35:29] sent a
[1:35:31] prophet to remind them of who they
[1:35:37] are the Lord sent a
[1:35:41] vessel are y'all come on now the Lord
[1:35:45] said thus sayith the Lord remember
[1:35:48] remember I brought you up out of
[1:35:52] Egypt to to be
[1:35:56] possessors come on your the the
[1:35:59] ancestors all the generation they did
[1:36:03] not they always aired in their hearts
[1:36:05] toward the word of God but there was a
[1:36:08] generation that possessed this land and
[1:36:10] I'm telling you that you are the Royal
[1:36:13] Seed of
[1:36:15] Abraham I'm telling you that your name
[1:36:18] is written all over this land it is not
[1:36:20] the amalekites
[1:36:24] it is not them it's your land can you
[1:36:27] say
[1:36:28] amen hallelujah hallelujah oh that just
[1:36:31] makes me want to
[1:36:33] shout
[1:36:35] amen brought you up out of that house of
[1:36:38] bondage the next thing you hear is God
[1:36:42] appearing unto
[1:36:45] Gideon and when God Appears unto Gideon
[1:36:49] Gideon is hiding I'm not going to keep
[1:36:51] you too much longer but Gideon is hiding
[1:36:54] the scripture says he's hiding behind
[1:36:55] the wine presses he is
[1:36:58] hiding and when the angel of the Lord
[1:37:01] came up to him it's so incredible he he
[1:37:04] told him he saids now you're just a poor
[1:37:07] miserable creature right now but I'm
[1:37:08] going to make something of you amen
[1:37:11] you're you're worthless you're amen
[1:37:14] that's not what he said he he said that
[1:37:17] uh 612 turn turn to 612 amen of of
[1:37:21] Judges he says for in the the angel of
[1:37:23] the Lord appeared unto him and said unto
[1:37:25] him what did they say everyone read it
[1:37:26] with me the Lord is with
[1:37:34] thee the dude is hiding behind a wine
[1:37:39] press the dude is is is as scared he is
[1:37:43] as chicken as chicken can
[1:37:46] be but God has got a
[1:37:50] promise amen
[1:37:53] it's time there come that there Come
[1:37:56] Those Junction of time there come that
[1:37:58] time where the crossroads come and God
[1:38:02] says it's time to turn
[1:38:05] northward it's
[1:38:08] time he says and Gideon said oh my Lord
[1:38:11] the 13th verse oh my Lord if the Lord be
[1:38:14] with us why then is all of this befallen
[1:38:18] us where be all his miracles which our
[1:38:21] fathers told us of did not the Lord
[1:38:23] bring us up out of
[1:38:25] Egypt but now the Lord ha forsaken us
[1:38:27] and delivered us unto the hands of the
[1:38:30] midianites now that's his
[1:38:34] perspective he was in that rut of going
[1:38:36] around and around and around and around
[1:38:39] and around but the Lord was trying to
[1:38:41] say you've compassed this mountain long
[1:38:44] enough it's time it's time
[1:38:49] to it's time to go
[1:38:51] northward and the Lord looked upon him
[1:38:54] and said go this in this thy might and
[1:38:59] thou shalt save Israel from the hand of
[1:39:02] the
[1:39:03] midianites have not I sent thee and he
[1:39:07] said unto him oh my Lord wherewith shall
[1:39:10] I save Israel behold my family is poor
[1:39:12] in Manasseh I am the least of my poor
[1:39:15] family's
[1:39:16] house and the Lord said unto him
[1:39:20] surely I will be with
[1:39:25] thee and thou somebody say
[1:39:30] thou not my mama not my daddy but thou
[1:39:35] shal Smite the
[1:39:38] midianites as one

[1:40:05] covered over by all that Wilderness junk
[1:40:10] it was covered over by all of that
[1:40:12] unbelief and God has to get us to that
