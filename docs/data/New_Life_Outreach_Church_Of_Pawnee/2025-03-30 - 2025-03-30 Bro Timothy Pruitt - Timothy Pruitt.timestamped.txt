[17:31] Man, it's been a while since I sang the
[17:33] song, so y'all just try to help me sing
[17:35] it. One night,
[17:38] while life's raing
[17:41] sea, the
[17:43] desire would suffer
[17:46] defeat. The blackness of night falls off
[17:51] the light. My heart saint with fear.
[17:58] A desperate
[18:00] cry ring out with cry. And all I could
[18:04] see was no hope
[18:07] inside. Faith all of the
[18:10] corn. I met the one. He came looking for
[18:15] me. Can somebody tell the light? He came
[18:19] looking for
[18:20] [Music]
[18:22] me. He came looking for me.
[18:28] Yes, he made a way when there was no way
[18:34] I could
[18:38] see and I
[18:41] drove. Jesus drew near and he rescued my
[18:45] soul and all my fears save my
[18:51] heart. I am the one. He came looking for
[18:56] me. Sing that second verse now. And now
[19:00] Satan had already picked out my grave
[19:04] and his plan for put me
[19:09] away. Drifted so far. Would anyone care
[19:14] that I'd soon be
[19:18] lost? Yeah. I knew my destruction was
[19:22] but a matter of time. But Jesus healed
[19:26] here and he said this for he's mine. Now
[19:30] I'm save from all since he walked
[19:33] through the storm. He came looking for
[19:39] me. He came looking for
[19:44] me. He came looking for me.
[19:48] [Music]
[19:50] I know he made a way, but there was no
[19:55] way that I could
[20:00] see. I drifted so far, but Jesus, he's
[20:05] here to rescue my soul and calm all my
[20:10] fears. Save
[20:13] from I am the one. He came looking. We
[20:17] can take it up on the second verse in
[20:19] your
[20:20] hand. And
[20:22] I already picked out my grave and his
[20:26] plan. I move forward to put me away. I
[20:31] drifted so far. Would anyone care? I'd
[20:36] soon be
[20:39] lost. Man, my destruction was a matter
[20:45] of time. for Jesus. He appeared and
[20:49] said, "This boy, he's mine. No sin from
[20:52] a harm. Since he walk through the storm,
[20:56] he came looking for
[20:59] me." Yes, he came looking for
[21:05] me. He came looking for
[21:11] me. He made a way. There was no way that
[21:17] I could
[21:18] [Music]
[21:21] see when
[21:23] I
[21:24] [Music]
[21:26] Jesus rescue my soul from all my
[21:31] peace from my heart. I
[21:35] never came again for me.
[21:41] Now I'm pull my heart and he walked
[21:45] through the storm came looking for
[21:51] [Music]
[21:53] me.
[21:56] Hallelujah. Turn up. Turn up my
[21:59] praise. Amen. Is that your testimony
[22:01] this morning? Hallelujah. Safe from all
[22:04] harm cuz he came looking for me. Amen.
[22:07] Let's sing this little song as sister L
[22:09] Martin prepares her ringer
[22:12] special. Turn up my
[22:15] praise. Drown
[22:18] out. Holding my shield of
[22:22] faith and I feel no
[22:25] alone. When the enemy
[22:29] comes in like a
[22:31] word, I will raise up my
[22:35] standard and
[22:39] overcome. Satan, can you hear me? This
[22:43] line is for
[22:45] you. You have no
[22:48] power over what I go
[22:51] through. Victory may be in Jesus.
[22:57] Oh
[22:58] yes. Turn up my
[23:01] praise. Show you what they can do. I'm
[23:05] going to turn up my
[23:08] praise and drown out the
[23:11] doubt. Holding my shield of
[23:14] faith and I feel no
[23:17] alarm. When the enemy
[23:21] comes in like a
[23:24] flood, I will raise up my
[23:27] standard and
[23:29] [Music]
[23:31] overcome. If right after her, Sister
[23:34] Rebecca Adams, if you would bring your
[23:37] [Music]
[23:49] [Applause]
[23:52] soul, I
[24:00] wonder does We understand.
[24:05] Sometimes I wish you
[24:13] [Music]
[24:21] Hey
[24:23] [Music]
[24:35] [Music]
[24:37] every me
[24:42] So he is singing.
[24:46] is
[24:50] so sometimes those voices try
[24:56] to go in and falling too far
[25:01] from but I know what's
[25:04] going on in his
[25:08] promises even
[25:11] singing he's singing
[25:15] Did he move every mountain? Did he part
[25:20] every
[25:23] [Music]
[25:36] [Applause]
[25:38] [Music]
[25:43] sing because of me too much? Now I can't
[25:50] deny he's gone through every single
[25:56] time from the beginning until the
[26:03] end will
[26:07] be
[26:12] now. Did he move every mountain? Did he
[26:16] part
[26:20] every
[26:23] so did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[26:28] deliver me? Yes, he did.
[26:35] No. Did he move every mountain? city for
[26:40] every
[26:44] So you see
[26:46] [Music]
[26:49] him the darkness. Did he deliver me? You
[26:54] see
[26:55] it? Oh
[26:59] yes. You
[27:02] see you
[27:05] [Music]
[27:07] speaking. No.
[27:10] [Music]
[27:16] Hallelujah. We've seen too much to turn
[27:19] back now. Amen. He's been too good to
[27:22] us. He's healed our body. It reminds me
[27:24] of the story while Sister Rebecca's
[27:26] getting ready. Brother Brandham got the
[27:29] Holy Ghost as a a young man. He came to
[27:31] the preacher. You know, the preacher
[27:33] says, "Have you you got the Holy Ghost?"
[27:35] He says, "Yeah." He says, "Okay." So,
[27:37] was you sprinkled? You did this, did
[27:38] that? You know, Brother Brandon says,
[27:40] "No, I was repented. I got baptized in
[27:42] the name of Jesus. Then I got the Holy
[27:44] Ghost. He says, "No, you don't get it
[27:45] that way." He goes, "No, it's too late.
[27:48] I done got it." You see, there's no
[27:50] matter what anybody could say. Done. Too
[27:53] late, devil. I've done experienced the
[27:55] mighty God. I've done been saved. I've
[27:57] done been filled. No matter what you
[27:59] say, I believe there's an almighty God.
[28:02] Amen. God bless
[28:07] you.

[33:05] bread in our arms. Can we stand and sing
[33:09] a whisper? We pour out our praise to you
[33:16] all. Great are you, Lord. Sing it
[33:23] again. It's your
[33:25] breath in our

[34:44] come, longing just to breathe.
[34:50] something that's of
[34:52] worth that will bless your
[34:59] heart. I'll bring you more than a
[35:04] song. For a song in
[35:07] itself is not what you have required.
[35:15] You search much deeper
[35:19] within through the way things appear.
[35:23] You're looking into my
[35:30] heart. I'm coming back to heart of

[36:26] worth that will bless your heart.
[36:34] I'll bring you more than a
[36:38] song. For a song in
[36:42] itself, you have
[36:48] required. You search much deeper
[36:53] within through the way things
[36:57] appear into my heart.
[37:02] [Music]
[37:04] I'm coming back to heart of
[37:11] worship about
[37:14] you. It's all about you,
[37:18] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the things
[37:23] I've made it. When it's all about
[37:28] you, it's all about you,
[37:33] Jesus. King of endless
[37:37] world. No one could
[37:41] express how much you
[37:44] [Music]
[37:48] deserve. Though I'm weak and
[37:52] poor, all I have is
[37:56] yours. Every single
[37:59] breath. I'll bring you
[38:02] more. I'll bring you more than a
[38:07] song. For a song in
[38:11] itself you have required.
[38:18] You search much deeper
[38:22] within through the way things appear.
[38:26] You're looking into my
[38:32] heart. I'm coming back to the heart of

[39:32] Jesus. Amen. You We're ready for the
[39:35] word of the Lord this morning. Amen.
[39:37] Let's sing the song as the man of God
[39:39] prepares to come. You are awesome in
[39:43] this
[39:44] place, mighty
[39:48] God. You are awesome in this

[40:01] praise. To you our hearts we

[40:10] Mighty God, the verse
[40:13] one. As I come into your
[40:17] presence, past the gates of
[40:21] praise, into your
[40:24] sanctuary, till we're standing face to
[40:29] face. I look upon your countenance. I

[42:42] There's a place home at land
[42:46] heaven. And oh, I want to see him. Look
[42:52] upon his
[42:54] [Music]
[42:57] [Applause]
[43:00] face. And on the streets of
[43:04] glory, let me lift my
[43:07] voice. Here's our
[43:11] past ever to

[43:20] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[43:23] Lord. Amen. How many's looking forward
[43:26] to that time to see him? Amen. Won't you
[43:29] just turn around, greet your neighbor,
[43:31] say, "Let's have church this
[43:33] morning." Amen.
[43:36] [Music]
[43:43] Hallelujah. Amen. It's good to be in the
[43:46] house of the Lord. How many enjoyed the
[43:49] service last night? How many received
[43:51] something from the
[43:53] Lord?
[43:55] [Music]
[43:59] Amen.
[44:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just bow our
[44:04] hearts to him for a moment. Father, we
[44:06] just come to you today, Lord. Just
[44:08] asking you once again to speak to us,
[44:11] Lord, by your word. And Lord, just take
[44:14] the weakness of our humanity, Lord, and
[44:16] strengthen it, Father, for your glory.
[44:19] Lord, as we would leave this place today
[44:21] as we close these meetings, Lord, may
[44:24] you just go with each one, each van,
[44:26] each each car, each bus. Lord, may you
[44:30] just go with each each heart. We pray.
[44:33] May May they carry home the victory that
[44:36] you've brought in their lives and share
[44:38] it to others, Lord, of how great their
[44:40] God is. We pray. We commit this service
[44:43] to you for your glory in Jesus name.
[44:48] Amen. Let's turn to Deuteronomy
[44:55] 20. Amen. Just a little weak in voice
[44:57] this morning, but Amen. We serve a great
[45:00] God. Amen. Amen. So, just need a little
[45:04] bit more of your amens.
[45:07] Amen. I don't care if you put your
[45:08] thumbs up this morning. Whatever you got
[45:10] to
[45:11] do.
[45:14] Amen. Deuteronomy 20 and verse one says,
[45:17] "When thou goest out to battle against
[45:20] thine enemies and see horses and
[45:23] chariots and people more than
[45:26] thou, be very
[45:28] afraid. Be scared." Now be not afraid of
[45:31] them, for the Lord thy God is with thee,
[45:35] which brought thee up out of the land of
[45:38] Egypt. And as shall be when ye are come
[45:41] nigh unto the battle, that the priest
[45:44] shall approach and speak unto the
[45:46] people, and shall say unto them, Here, O
[45:49] Israel, ye approach this day unto battle
[45:53] against your enemies. But let your
[45:55] hearts faint. Let not your hearts faint.
[45:59] Fear not. Do not tremble. Neither be you
[46:03] terrified because of them. For the Lord
[46:06] your God is he that goeth with you to
[46:10] fight for you against your enemies to
[46:13] save you.
[46:15] Hallelujah.
[46:17] Amen. I'd like to speak to you this this
[46:19] morning on this on this thought and I'll
[46:21] take the my title straight from the
[46:23] scripture here. Let not your hearts
[46:25] faint. Fear not, and do not tremble, and
[46:30] neither be ye terrified. Amen. God bless
[46:33] you. Be
[46:39] seated. Like to just even take a little
[46:43] subtitle. Don't matter. I know that
[46:46] probably hurt a lot of English
[46:47] professors ears right there. Don't
[46:50] matter. But it don't
[46:53] matter. Amen. Don't matter means that
[46:55] something is something that is not
[46:58] important or is
[47:00] insignificant or does not require
[47:03] concern or
[47:05] worry. Amen. You know, Israel many times
[47:08] in their battles were outnumbered. The
[47:11] enemy was better equipped. They were
[47:14] more trained. But God was showing them
[47:17] that it wasn't depending on their
[47:19] strength or how well equipped they were
[47:22] or how well trained they were. It all
[47:25] depended on him. So what mattered was he
[47:28] was with them. Amen. So what didn't
[47:32] matter is if they could match up with
[47:34] the enemy or they was as as equipped as
[47:36] the enemy or or or they was well trained
[47:39] as as the enemy. What mattered was God
[47:42] was with them. What didn't matter is if
[47:45] they had horses or chariots or not. What
[47:47] mattered was God was fighting for them.
[47:51] Amen. The same God that brought them out
[47:53] of the e out of Egypt was the same God
[47:55] that was going to bring them all the way
[47:57] to the promised land. And they were not
[48:00] even to look at the number of the
[48:01] enemies or count them or how much how
[48:04] much strength they had, how much horses
[48:06] they had, how many chariots it had
[48:09] because it didn't matter what the number
[48:11] was. It didn't matter how many chariots
[48:13] it was, it didn't matter how impossible
[48:15] it looked, what mattered was God was on
[48:18] their side. Amen. Even though it may
[48:21] have looked hopeless and it may not look
[48:23] like there was no way of victory, that
[48:25] didn't matter. What mattered is their
[48:27] God was standing by their side. Amen. I
[48:30] want you to understand today, you're
[48:31] going to leave this place and you're
[48:33] going to leave maybe this atmosphere
[48:34] that's been built here by many
[48:36] believers. And you may h go home, amen,
[48:38] to yourself, but that don't matter.
[48:40] Amen. because of God before you who can
[48:43] be against you. Amen. I want you to
[48:45] understand the giant that you may face
[48:48] will never be bigger than the God that
[48:50] is with you. Amen. He said to Joshua 1
[48:53] and verse 9, he said, "Have I not
[48:55] commanded thee? Be strong and of good
[48:57] courage. Be not afraid, neither be thou
[49:00] dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with
[49:03] thee whethersoever thou goest." Amen. It
[49:06] don't matter, Joshua, if you're in the
[49:08] valley. It don't matter what stands
[49:09] before you. It doesn't matter if they're
[49:12] innumerable. It doesn't matter if their
[49:14] number is the sands of the sea. It
[49:16] doesn't matter if it seems there's no
[49:18] way possible for victory. The enemy,
[49:21] whatever their size or capabilities are,
[49:24] don't matter. Amen. Cancer don't matter.
[49:27] Amen. If we can get to the understanding
[49:29] sickness doesn't matter. It doesn't
[49:31] matter how big it may look. Sin doesn't
[49:33] matter. What matters is there's a blood
[49:36] that is greater than every sickness.
[49:38] There's a blood that is greater than
[49:40] every sin. There's a blood that is
[49:42] greater than every situation that you
[49:45] could ever come across. What matters is
[49:48] God's on your
[49:49] side. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter.
[49:52] Amen. If if friends leave you or friends
[49:55] forsake you or or somebody walks away or
[49:58] or you're by yourself, that doesn't
[49:59] matter. What matters is God is for you.
[50:03] If we can understand when we leave this
[50:05] place and we walk away from here and we
[50:08] go to our homes and we go to our
[50:10] situations. Amen. Circumstances don't
[50:12] matter. Amen. Problems don't matter.
[50:15] Amen.
[50:16] Satan and his devices doesn't matter.
[50:19] What matters is I met God. What matters
[50:22] is I'm not leaving God here and he's not
[50:25] leaving me when I leave here. But God is
[50:28] going with me and he's for me and he's
[50:30] not against me. So what matter isn't how
[50:33] many stands up. What matter isn't how
[50:36] many comes against me. What matters is
[50:39] that God is for you.
[50:45] Amen. He brother say, you know, he said,
[50:47] I'm persuaded to believe that Joshua was
[50:50] just a little bitty runt.
[50:53] Come on
[50:55] now. He he would even bring it out about
[50:58] about Samson. He said, "The world, you
[51:00] know, paint Samson as some big guy with
[51:03] some big muscles." He said, "But he was
[51:04] just a little long-haired, skinny
[51:08] runt, little weak-l looking little
[51:10] fella. But it didn't matter how strong
[51:13] he looked or how good he looked or how
[51:16] equipped he looked." Amen. He didn't
[51:17] look equipped. He didn't look like he
[51:19] was able. Amen. But what mattered is
[51:22] when he needed God and the spirit of God
[51:24] would come down upon him, he could pick
[51:26] up the gates of Gaza. He could pick up a
[51:28] jawbone and whoop a thousand
[51:30] Philistines. Why? What mattered was who
[51:32] was with him, not who he was. What
[51:34] mattered was what God had promised him.
[51:37] And you, let me tell you this this
[51:39] morning, you have a promise this
[51:41] morning. You may leave this place. You
[51:43] may go home. You may go to such a
[51:45] certain situations. Amen. And that
[51:47] situation that you love may still be
[51:49] there. But what matters is you have met
[51:52] a God who will never leave you or
[51:55] forsake you. But he will be with you
[51:57] even in you to the end of the
[52:01] world. He said, "Well, why?" It didn't
[52:03] matter. He was a little bitty run. He
[52:06] said, "But I see him jump up on kind
[52:08] some kind of box." And he said, "Men and
[52:11] brother were more than able to take
[52:13] them." He said, "That was a seed of
[52:15] Abraham there. God had gave him the
[52:18] promise. That was their possession. God
[52:21] had given. It didn't matter what the
[52:23] opposition was.
[52:27] Hello.
[52:29] I could ask you this morning what your
[52:32] opposition was, but I can put it over
[52:34] that umbrella, over all that opposition.
[52:36] It don't matter.
[52:40] Amen. It don't matter. Amen. Why? It was
[52:43] a true seed of Abraham. So, we can take
[52:45] it. Why? What matters is God gave it to
[52:49] us. It don't matter if they got high
[52:51] walls. It don't matter if they got great
[52:54] cities. It don't matter if it's See,
[52:56] they got great mountains and there's
[52:57] giants there. Amen. It does not matter.
[53:00] What matters is God gave it to me.
[53:05] Amen. When you realize the enemy that
[53:08] you're dealing with is an insignificant
[53:10] enemy. Amen. He does not He does not
[53:13] have strength. He does not have ability.
[53:15] We done heard about it this weekend. His
[53:17] back was broke at Calvary.
[53:22] He said, "You stand here this morning."
[53:24] Amen. Said, "I don't care what anybody
[53:26] else says, what the doctor says, what
[53:28] the unbeliever says. We're more than a
[53:31] match for anything that comes along.
[53:38] Can I get a thumbs up on
[53:41] that?" Amen. We're more than a match for
[53:44] anything that comes along.
[53:48] We're more than a match for anything
[53:51] that comes along. Why? Because you're
[53:53] some great strong guy. No. Not because
[53:56] you're some great strong guy. Cuz you
[53:58] got your hair fixed just right? No. Not
[54:00] just because you got your hair fixed
[54:02] just right. You're you're more than a
[54:04] match cuz the God, Amen, is not just
[54:07] above you or just with you, but he's
[54:09] even in
[54:11] you. And that makes you more than a
[54:14] match for anything that comes along. For
[54:17] any depression, for any fear, for any
[54:20] anxiety, for any sickness, for any sin.
[54:23] You are more than a match.
[54:31] You are the seed of Abraham. We shall
[54:34] possess the gates of our enemy no matter
[54:38] what the enemy is.
[54:45] You know, we we live in a world that we
[54:47] want to matter.
[54:52] How you feel like Satan's feeling this
[54:54] morning when he's here and he don't
[54:55] matter.
[55:00] [Laughter]
[55:02] He don't matter cuz God gave the
[55:05] promise. He's our possession. Healing is
[55:07] your possession. Salvation is your
[55:10] possession. The Holy Ghost is your
[55:13] possession. He said, "There's great
[55:15] thousands of preachers and so forth in
[55:17] the land today that says it's not so,
[55:19] but the seed of Abraham knows it's so.
[55:21] They'll raid right into it and possess
[55:24] the gates of the enemy." Why? God said
[55:26] they would. Oh, God said they would, and
[55:29] they believe it because it's a promise.
[55:32] His seed shall possess the gates of the
[55:34] enemy. Oh, you'll go through testings.
[55:36] You'll go through trials.
[55:40] Let me tell you young people, you're
[55:42] going to go right back and you're going
[55:43] to go right back through testings and
[55:45] you're going to go right back through
[55:46] trials and you're going to go
[55:50] Amen. We're not here on a flowery bed of
[55:52] ease and and we're just floating along
[55:54] waiting on the rapture. No, we're going
[55:56] to fight our way.
[56:01] How many fighters I got here
[56:05] today? Amen. It doesn't matter what I'm
[56:08] going to face. I'm going to fight. It
[56:10] doesn't matter how many enemies comes
[56:12] up. I'm going to fight. It doesn't
[56:14] matter how much tries to stop me and
[56:16] tries to hinder me. I'm going to fight.
[56:19] I'm going to press my way into the
[56:22] kingdom of God. It doesn't matter if
[56:24] it's a Wednesday night or a Sunday
[56:26] morning. It doesn't matter what day it
[56:28] is. I'm a child of God and I'm going to
[56:31] fight if I must raise. Increase my
[56:34] courage, Lord.
[56:42] Joshua stood there and he said, "I don't
[56:44] care how big they are.
[56:49] I don't care what kind of spear they
[56:51] got. I don't care how high their cities
[56:54] are walled. Our God is a great God and
[56:59] that's all that matters."
[57:03] Joshua 11:4 said they went out and they
[57:06] all and all their hosts with them much
[57:08] people even as a sand that is upon the
[57:11] seashore and multitude and horses and
[57:13] chariots very many. And when all these
[57:16] kings were met together, we're talking
[57:18] about the five
[57:19] kings. Did you hear what how much they
[57:22] had there? They they were multi. They
[57:25] were like the sea on the sands of the
[57:28] shore or the sands on the seashore. I'm
[57:31] tired this morning. How many else is
[57:33] tired this morning? It don't
[57:39] [Applause]
[57:45] matter. It don't matter if we're tired
[57:47] this morning. We're still children of
[57:49] God and we're going to press through to
[57:51] the
[57:53] victory. Cuz what mattered is I got the
[57:56] Holy Ghost last night. What mattered is
[57:58] I got healed last night. What mattered
[58:01] is I received the victory last night.
[58:03] What mattered is God showed me it's not
[58:06] just for my mama. It's not just for my
[58:08] daddy. It's for me,
[58:10] too. That's what
[58:17] matters. But they were as a sand upon
[58:19] the seashore and multitude and horses
[58:22] and chariots, very many. And the Lord
[58:25] said to Joshua, "Be not afraid because
[58:28] of them. For tomorrow about this time,
[58:31] will I deliver them up all slain before
[58:33] Israel, and thou shalt hew their horses
[58:36] and burn their chariots with fire.
[58:43] Hallelujah. I I got I'm kind of like
[58:45] brother Andrew. I'm a little bit
[58:46] uneducated, so I got to look up words
[58:48] when I don't know what they are." He
[58:50] hues. That's a That means you're going
[58:52] to cut their tendons.
[58:55] You're going to hamstring them. It
[58:57] refers to making them unusable. It also
[59:01] means to pluck up, to root out, to dig
[59:03] out, to tear down.
[59:08] Hallelujah. Amen. You might be looking
[59:10] at an insurmountable task when you get
[59:13] home. You may be looking like looking at
[59:15] your room and saying, "There ain't no
[59:16] way I can clean all this nonsense out. I
[59:19] can get rid of all this stuff that Satan
[59:21] has piled in my life." But God is
[59:23] speaking to you this morning, saying,
[59:25] "You're not going home by
[59:28] yourself." Amen. But you're going home
[59:30] with Jehovah Gyra, the same yesterday,
[59:33] today, and forever. Amen. And you're
[59:35] going to he pornography. You're going to
[59:38] he demon of hell that has stole the
[59:40] victory from you over and over. And
[59:42] you're going to take his power and
[59:44] you're going to root it up. And you're
[59:46] going to cast it into the lake of fire.
[59:54] This is exactly what when David met
[59:58] Goliath. Now to everybody else in that
[1:00:01] camp, it mattered how big that guy was.
[1:00:06] It mattered. This guy's
[1:00:11] huge. Well, Andrew, I'm going to use
[1:00:15] you. Come here. Right here.
[1:00:19] Come here, little fella.
[1:00:31] Everybody else, it
[1:00:36] mattered. Me get down here so I can see
[1:00:38] what you really look
[1:00:43] like. I always talk about Brother
[1:00:45] Andrew. We're just going to be ourselves
[1:00:47] this morning.
[1:00:48] I call him two steps because it takes
[1:00:50] him about two steps to get across the
[1:00:53] platform. Big
[1:00:56] tall. Big tall fella. And to this little
[1:00:59] fella, he may look
[1:01:04] big. I ain't going to call you Goliath.
[1:01:06] I can't do it. Go sit
[1:01:09] down. Just showing you what it looked
[1:01:12] like. How impossible it may look. How
[1:01:15] impossible it may seem. It looked
[1:01:18] impossible to David's brothers. They
[1:01:20] were warriors from their youth and and
[1:01:21] they had been trained for battle. They
[1:01:23] had had great training. They had fought
[1:01:24] along Saul for a long time. They'd meet
[1:01:26] Amalachites and they'd beat this one and
[1:01:28] they'd beat that one. But all of a
[1:01:29] sudden, a champion come out and they get
[1:01:32] begin to hide in their tents cuz what
[1:01:33] mattered was how big this guy was.
[1:01:37] He's huge. He's all I don't know what to
[1:01:40] do about him. So, you know what they
[1:01:41] did? They went inside their tents and
[1:01:43] they pulled their laptops up and they
[1:01:45] start trying to find quotes and start
[1:01:46] trying to find scriptures. Amen. Listen,
[1:01:48] it ain't all about quotes and scriptures
[1:01:50] being on a laptop. It's about being in a
[1:01:52] life somewhere. Amen. That's what we
[1:01:55] want in this meetings is not just to
[1:01:57] have quotes and scriptures up on pages,
[1:02:00] but we want to be the written word of
[1:02:01] almighty God. That when we come against
[1:02:04] our Goliath, we know, Amen. the same God
[1:02:07] Elijah knew. We know the same one that
[1:02:10] our pastor knows. We know the same one
[1:02:12] our daddy knows. And if God was with
[1:02:14] them, he'll also be with
[1:02:18] me. This is where David was. He said, "I
[1:02:21] serve the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[1:02:24] Jacob. He was Abraham's God. He was
[1:02:28] Isaac's God. He was Jacob's God. But
[1:02:30] he's also my
[1:02:35] God." And it didn't matter to him. Hey,
[1:02:39] man. He coming to the camp and he's
[1:02:40] walking in there with a few snacks. You
[1:02:42] know, he had some Cheezits
[1:02:47] and some chicken
[1:02:50] strips. He had some few things for his
[1:02:52] brothers to eat and he's just walking,
[1:02:54] minding no one's business, and he's just
[1:02:56] walking along. All a sudden, he hears
[1:02:58] this challenge. And he looked over
[1:03:00] there. You know, it didn't matter how
[1:03:03] big he was to David. It didn't matter
[1:03:05] how big his shoes was. It didn't matter
[1:03:07] how big his shield was. It didn't
[1:03:09] matter. It didn't matter what what
[1:03:10] anything the giant had was. What
[1:03:13] mattered to David was God's word. And
[1:03:15] God had given them the promise. God had
[1:03:18] gi them an inheritance. And what
[1:03:21] mattered was this was an uncircumcised
[1:03:24] Philistine that was standing upon what
[1:03:26] God gave me.
[1:03:32] And so David, Amen. He says, "Look, I'll
[1:03:35] go fight him."
[1:03:37] Well, let me bring up a few matters to
[1:03:39] you. He's been a warrior since his
[1:03:41] youth. David, did you see that shield?
[1:03:43] Did you see that spear? Did you see how
[1:03:46] tall he was? Did you see how big he was?
[1:03:48] Did you see how great he was? Did you
[1:03:50] see how impossible it is? David just
[1:03:53] said, "It don't matter."
[1:03:59] If you'll look at your enemy with that
[1:04:01] kind of
[1:04:02] attitude, you don't matter.
[1:04:08] I know it's simple, but it's true. If
[1:04:11] you'll begin to realize you're dealing
[1:04:13] with a bluff, you're dealing with a
[1:04:16] conquered
[1:04:17] foe, and he's trying to bluff you out of
[1:04:20] your inheritance. I've stood there in
[1:04:22] that same place that David stood, and I
[1:04:24] I looked over here where the the
[1:04:26] Israelites were camped, and they have
[1:04:28] found, Amen, archaeological digs and
[1:04:30] things. And I looked over here where the
[1:04:32] Philistines were.
[1:04:35] Right in the middle was this little
[1:04:37] brook. And I was able to walk right down
[1:04:39] to that brook and get me some stones.
[1:04:45] Amen. You know what I realized right
[1:04:48] then, brother Andrew? Everything David
[1:04:50] needed to defeat that Goliath was
[1:04:52] already in the land.
[1:04:55] [Applause]
[1:05:01] Hallelujah. Amen. God had already
[1:05:04] provided it for them.
[1:05:08] God had already created it. He had
[1:05:10] already put it there.
[1:05:13] Amen. Those stones had already defeated
[1:05:15] an enemy before.
[1:05:18] Read the Bible. Amen. Right before David
[1:05:20] and his life as the children of Israel
[1:05:22] would come into the promised land, God
[1:05:24] rang stones down upon their enemy.
[1:05:28] It defeated the enemy before. It'll
[1:05:30] defeat him again.
[1:05:33] Oh, he might have got bigger. He might
[1:05:35] have got stronger. He might have got
[1:05:36] darker. He might have got this or
[1:05:38] whatever. He might have got seem to be
[1:05:40] more scarier. But it don't matter. What
[1:05:42] matters is there's a promise laying in
[1:05:45] the book.
[1:05:47] And all I got to do is walk into that
[1:05:49] book and find me a promise and put it in
[1:05:52] my sling of faith and knock my giant
[1:05:55] down.
[1:06:02] And that's what David
[1:06:04] did. He took that stone. He put it in
[1:06:08] his sling. John says you now it didn't
[1:06:10] matter to the giant who he was facing.
[1:06:13] He said, "Who am I a dog? You going to
[1:06:16] send me a little boy out?" But he failed
[1:06:19] to realize it was an unseen force.
[1:06:25] Come on now. He failed to realize and
[1:06:28] calculate exactly right what was going
[1:06:30] on. Amen. And a stone hit him right
[1:06:33] there in his head
[1:06:37] and he fell down on his face and David
[1:06:39] did what he said. He went up, ran up
[1:06:41] there and took his sword and cut his
[1:06:42] head
[1:06:44] off. Now I want to read you in the Bible
[1:06:46] again. And it said when David had done
[1:06:48] that, the men in Israel and Judah arose
[1:06:51] and shouted and pursued the Philistines
[1:06:54] unto come to the valley and to the gates
[1:06:58] of Echron. Echron again means torn up by
[1:07:01] the roots.
[1:07:05] Come on now. Amen. This is what you got
[1:07:08] to do. You got to realize, listen, my
[1:07:11] pornography don't matter. My sin don't
[1:07:13] matter. What's been hold my gaming don't
[1:07:16] matter.
[1:07:19] Everything that's been holding me back
[1:07:20] from being a trueborn Christian of God
[1:07:23] and the victory of the Holy Ghost, it
[1:07:25] don't matter. I'm going to go home and
[1:07:27] I'm going to tear it up by the
[1:07:32] roots. Come on,
[1:07:35] somebody. Amen. And it's important
[1:07:37] because you know when you have a garden,
[1:07:39] you you you have a garden, you got
[1:07:41] certain places, certain plants you want
[1:07:42] to keep and there these weeds grow up
[1:07:44] seem like they grow up faster than the
[1:07:46] plants you want. You know how it works.
[1:07:47] And and you know I was a little boy and
[1:07:49] my my dad used to grow a big garden and
[1:07:51] I be honest with I hated it because
[1:07:53] there's a lot of work as a little boy. I
[1:07:55] I want to do something else. I go
[1:07:56] fishing. I want do something else. He
[1:07:58] said, "Well, you can do that if you hold
[1:08:00] these row of beans." I said, "Boy, let
[1:08:02] me have that
[1:08:03] hole." I went down through that thing. I
[1:08:06] was all proud of myself. Said, "I'm
[1:08:08] done, Dad." He said, "You ain't done."
[1:08:11] He said, "All you did was just take off
[1:08:14] it at the
[1:08:15] surface." He said, "Those weeds have to
[1:08:18] be dug up from the roots cuz if you
[1:08:21] don't dig the root out of there, they
[1:08:23] just going to grow right back up
[1:08:27] again." Come on, somebody. This is what
[1:08:30] you got to do.
[1:08:35] Amen. And this is what circumcision is
[1:08:36] all about. Amen. We don't have
[1:08:38] circumcision of the flesh, but of the
[1:08:40] heart.
[1:08:41] He would tell the children of Israel
[1:08:43] when they went over to the promised
[1:08:44] land, "Get you a sharp knife." Amen.
[1:08:46] It's time to cut off all the excess.
[1:08:51] Come on. We got a lot of excess in our
[1:08:54] lives that don't matter. We got a lot of
[1:08:56] things that we pay a lot of attention to
[1:08:58] that don't matter. Amen. It's time you
[1:09:00] just cut that off. Amen. And take it off
[1:09:02] when it'll never come back again. Amen.
[1:09:05] Dig it up by the
[1:09:07] roots. Destroy your
[1:09:09] enemy. You have been given the power
[1:09:12] over the sin in your life. You have been
[1:09:14] given the power to overcome in your
[1:09:16] life. But you have to take that sword
[1:09:19] and saying, "Devil, you I'm not just
[1:09:20] going to cut it off of the surface. I'm
[1:09:23] going down into the depths and I'm going
[1:09:25] to cut it all the way out."
[1:09:33] Some of y'all need to go home and have a
[1:09:35] burning.
[1:09:42] Hello,
[1:09:46] somebody. Need to have a
[1:09:52] burning borrow. One from brother Joe
[1:09:54] Adams. He preached a sermon on Amen.
[1:09:57] burning the
[1:09:58] ships. You There was a there was a a man
[1:10:01] that had come found some land and he
[1:10:03] wanted to take it and he had to come and
[1:10:05] try to take it, but his men would always
[1:10:07] go back to the ship. So, you know,
[1:10:08] because they'd get scared or afraid and
[1:10:10] they just go back to their comfort zone.
[1:10:18] Oh yeah. We as young people, we got a
[1:10:20] lot of We got our own little comfort
[1:10:21] zone.
[1:10:23] You don't want to deal with stuff
[1:10:24] sometimes. Just go into your room and
[1:10:26] shut yourself away and get in your
[1:10:28] little comfortable spot. Put your
[1:10:30] earbuds in and start listening to stuff
[1:10:32] you ain't supposed to. Start before you
[1:10:33] know it, you're looking at stuff you
[1:10:34] ain't supposed to. Before you know it,
[1:10:36] you're dwelling on stuff you ain't.
[1:10:41] It's a shame that we become more
[1:10:43] comfortable with devils than we do with
[1:10:45] God.
[1:10:46] Amen. We allow things to come in our
[1:10:48] lives because it's comfortable to us.
[1:10:51] Amen. It's time that we become very
[1:10:52] uncomfortable around spirits of hell.
[1:10:57] Amen. We don't allow them to come into
[1:10:59] our lives and dictate things in our
[1:11:01] life, but we realize they don't matter.
[1:11:04] They're not of eternal value. There's
[1:11:06] only one thing that matters, and that's
[1:11:08] what's eternal.
[1:11:21] size of the enemy doesn't matter. The
[1:11:23] strength of the enemy does not matter.
[1:11:26] What matters is if you know your
[1:11:30] God. That he'll come for you in your
[1:11:33] moment of need and situation because he
[1:11:35] promised he would. He promised he would
[1:11:37] be there. Amen. He He He ain't never
[1:11:40] failed one
[1:11:43] time. He ain't started yet and he won't
[1:11:45] start
[1:11:48] now. Amen. There was Jehoshaphat, I
[1:11:51] believe it was, that was surrounded by
[1:11:53] an enemy and evil had come upon them and
[1:11:55] and the children of Ammon and Moab had
[1:11:58] come to Mount Zir and and and they were
[1:12:00] trying they would they would they would
[1:12:01] invade and and you know here here he's
[1:12:03] calling upon the Lord and he's like Lord
[1:12:05] what are we going to do? Oh God, wil
[1:12:07] thou not judge them? With thou we for we
[1:12:10] have no might against this great company
[1:12:11] that cometh against us, neither know
[1:12:13] what we to do. But our eyes are upon
[1:12:18] thee. And Judah stood before the Lord
[1:12:21] and with their little ones and their
[1:12:22] wives and their children. Then upon
[1:12:24] Jehazel, the son of Zachariah came the
[1:12:26] spirit of the Lord in the midst of the
[1:12:28] congregation. And he said, "Hearken ye,
[1:12:30] oh Judah, and you inhabitants of
[1:12:31] Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat.
[1:12:34] Thus saith the Lord unto you, be not
[1:12:36] afraid, nor dismayed by reason of this
[1:12:39] great multitude, for the battle is not
[1:12:42] yours.
[1:12:45] Hallelujah. The battle is not yours, but
[1:12:48] God. But tomorrow go ye down against
[1:12:51] them and come by the cliff of Ziz, and
[1:12:53] you shall find them at the end of the
[1:12:55] brook before the wilderness of Jeru. And
[1:12:57] you shall not need fighting this battle.
[1:13:00] But set yourselves and stand you still
[1:13:02] and see the salvation of the Lord, oh
[1:13:04] Judah. Fear not, nor be dismayed, for
[1:13:07] tomorrow go out against them, for the
[1:13:10] Lord will be with you.
[1:13:14] And if I have something to say this
[1:13:16] morning, Amen. When you leave this camp,
[1:13:18] don't fear. When you leave this camp,
[1:13:20] don't be dismayed. You're not going by
[1:13:22] yourself. But the God of heaven is going
[1:13:26] before
[1:13:30] you. He promised he
[1:13:37] would. Syria's strength didn't matter.
[1:13:41] Their king didn't matter.
[1:13:45] In 2 Chronicles, we can read about
[1:13:47] Sakaribb or how you pronounce that man's
[1:13:49] name. All I know is it fits in
[1:13:54] all king of Assyria and entered into
[1:13:57] Judah and he camped against the fence
[1:13:59] cities and thought to win them for
[1:14:02] himself. He thought he was going to do
[1:14:04] this. And when Hezekiah saw that this s
[1:14:08] sync was come that he was purposed to
[1:14:11] fight against Jerusalem, he took counsel
[1:14:12] with his princes and the mighty men to
[1:14:14] stop the waters of the fountains were
[1:14:16] without the city and they did help him.
[1:14:18] So they were gathered much people
[1:14:19] together who stopped all the fountains.
[1:14:21] The brooks that ran the midst of the
[1:14:22] land, saying, why should the king of
[1:14:24] Syria come and find much water? And he
[1:14:26] strengthened himself and he built up all
[1:14:28] the walls that were broken. And he
[1:14:29] raised up the towers and and another
[1:14:31] wall without and repaired Milo in the
[1:14:33] city of David and made darts and
[1:14:35] shields. And he set capsules of war and
[1:14:37] gathered them together and the gate of
[1:14:39] the city and spank spake comfortably to
[1:14:41] them, saying, "Be strong and courageous.
[1:14:44] Be not afraid nor dismayed for the king
[1:14:47] of Assyria, nor all the multitude that
[1:14:49] is with them. For there is more with us
[1:14:51] than there is with
[1:14:54] him. For with him is the arm of flesh."
[1:14:57] I want you to understand what he was
[1:14:59] counting. With him as the arm of flesh,
[1:15:01] but with us is the Lord our God to help
[1:15:04] us and to fight our
[1:15:08] battles. God is with
[1:15:11] you. Young people, if you can realize it
[1:15:13] this morning, he's not just with your
[1:15:15] mom. He's not just with your dad. He's
[1:15:18] not just with all these ministers up
[1:15:19] here. He is with you.
[1:15:25] God is with you. Let not your heart
[1:15:27] faint. Fear not. Don't tremble.
[1:15:32] Neither be you terrified. Nothing the
[1:15:34] devil can do matters.
[1:15:42] He doesn't matters. What matters is God
[1:15:45] is with you.
[1:15:52] And don't let me tell you, he's going to
[1:15:54] the devil's going to come and tell you
[1:15:55] that God
[1:15:57] ain't. Well, you ain't felt him in a
[1:16:00] long
[1:16:00] time. Well, it don't it don't matter
[1:16:03] what my feelings say.
[1:16:07] It doesn't matter what I
[1:16:09] feel. It matters what his word says.
[1:16:14] Come on now.
[1:16:17] If we can realize our feelings really
[1:16:19] don't matter.
[1:16:23] I know that's hard to swallow in a
[1:16:25] church because we want our feelings to
[1:16:26] be petted and we want our feelings to
[1:16:28] be we're just like a cat. Long as our
[1:16:31] feelings is rubbed the right way, we're
[1:16:33] just all happy and happy golucky and God
[1:16:36] bless you pastor. I love you pastor. But
[1:16:39] as soon as something comes and rubs it
[1:16:40] the other way,
[1:16:48] All of a sudden, our feelings
[1:16:50] matter. But listen, if we can get to the
[1:16:53] place and it really doesn't matter about
[1:16:54] my feelings.
[1:16:58] Come on. It doesn't matter about how I
[1:17:00] feel or how I how I think. What matters
[1:17:03] is God's word said.
[1:17:07] It doesn't matter if I feel him in a
[1:17:09] service or not. His word said, "Where
[1:17:11] two or three are gathered in my name,
[1:17:13] I'll be there."
[1:17:16] It doesn't matter if I feel like going
[1:17:18] to church or not, it matters. He said,
[1:17:20] "Forsake not the assembling of yourself
[1:17:22] together, even the much more as you see
[1:17:24] that day approaching." That's what
[1:17:26] matters.
[1:17:28] It doesn't matter. Amen. If you feel
[1:17:30] like you're loved or you feel like
[1:17:32] you're hated, that doesn't matter. What
[1:17:34] matters is God said, "I loved you. I
[1:17:37] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:17:39] world." And no man, or can I say it like
[1:17:42] this? No devil can pluck you out of his
[1:17:45] hand.
[1:17:48] That's what
[1:18:00] matters. Well, I mean, he came to a
[1:18:03] prophet and told him he didn't have no
[1:18:04] power with God and he didn't matter to
[1:18:07] God. That's what he did. He said about
[1:18:09] two or three months ago, I was I was in
[1:18:11] my room. I heard a voice speaking in a
[1:18:13] corner. And he said, "I thought about
[1:18:14] waking my wife to look at it. A hideous
[1:18:16] looking thing standing there accusing
[1:18:20] me." I woke up and said, "Better get the
[1:18:24] children, you know." I looked over and
[1:18:25] there's this hideous thing and looked
[1:18:27] like Alioop in the funny paper. Now, I'm
[1:18:30] not even old enough to know what Alioop
[1:18:32] looked
[1:18:33] like. Oh, brother Ben, you are.
[1:18:42] I'm going I'm gonna
[1:18:47] behave. But apparently he was a very
[1:18:49] ugly looking creature. Not something you
[1:18:52] want to wake up and look at first thing
[1:18:54] in the
[1:18:57] morning. You know, while we're on that,
[1:18:59] just for a
[1:19:04] second, we spoke about boys being in the
[1:19:07] mirror. I met some this morning that
[1:19:09] said they wasn't in the mirror long
[1:19:10] enough they had to go back and put some
[1:19:11] hairspray
[1:19:14] on. Apparently, their hair matters to
[1:19:19] them. I'm going to leave unsaid who said
[1:19:22] that, but he's sitting right over there
[1:19:24] on the front row.
[1:19:31] He said, "I thought about waking her." I
[1:19:32] said, "Well, that'll scare her to
[1:19:34] death." And I said, "Well, just wait a
[1:19:36] minute and stand and watch." He said,
[1:19:37] "People talk about devils don't even
[1:19:39] know what they are sometimes, but you
[1:19:41] run headlong into them every
[1:19:43] day." But after a while, he started
[1:19:46] accusing me. He said, "You have no power
[1:19:48] with God. You're just a bluff. You have
[1:19:51] no power."
[1:19:53] What? To somebody that has stood in a
[1:19:56] platform night after night and cast
[1:19:58] Satan out night after night, night after
[1:20:00] night and he gonna come and tell him he
[1:20:02] has no power with God.
[1:20:07] But that didn't matter what he
[1:20:10] said. Brother Adam said, I said, "Satan,
[1:20:13] you're an offense to
[1:20:14] me. Get out of my way.
[1:20:24] Come
[1:20:25] on. Come on. It's sometimes time some of
[1:20:29] you get some backbone about yourself.
[1:20:31] You've allowed that devil to stand in
[1:20:33] your room long
[1:20:35] enough. Oh, he came in and he was silent
[1:20:38] for a little bit, but after a while, you
[1:20:39] let him stand there, he'll start telling
[1:20:41] you things. He'll start telling you you
[1:20:43] ain't worthy. He'll start telling you
[1:20:45] you're not going to make it. He'll start
[1:20:46] telling you the message ain't for you.
[1:20:48] He'll start telling you, you ain't got
[1:20:49] no power with God. But you need to go
[1:20:52] back to what the word said. Satan, you
[1:20:54] are offense to me. Get out of my
[1:21:02] way in the name of Jesus Christ. That's
[1:21:06] what
[1:21:09] matters. I don't come to you with fear.
[1:21:12] I don't come in you with anxiety. I
[1:21:14] ain't come trembling. I'm coming in the
[1:21:16] name of Jesus Christ. And in the name of
[1:21:18] Jesus Christ, I take authority over
[1:21:25] [Applause]
[1:21:27] you. And he left
[1:21:34] and I laid there a little bit in bed and
[1:21:36] I started to raise up. He said, "But a
[1:21:38] real sweet feeling come over
[1:21:42] me." And I thought, "I wonder if the
[1:21:44] Holy Spirit now is close." He said, "So
[1:21:47] help me with my Bible over my heart."
[1:21:48] The sweetest voice I ever heard in my
[1:21:50] life said, 'D don't fear to go anywhere.
[1:21:53] Don't fear to do anything. For the
[1:21:55] neverfailing presence of Jesus Christ is
[1:21:58] with you wherever you go.
[1:22:03] Hallelujah. If you got Jesus, you got
[1:22:05] everything. If you got Jesus, Amen. He's
[1:22:08] with you wherever you go. You say,
[1:22:10] "Well, I wish I could hear him say that
[1:22:12] to me." He did say that to you. He said,
[1:22:14] "I'll be with you and I'll never leave
[1:22:16] you or forsake
[1:22:18] you." That means he'll go with you
[1:22:21] through your trial. He'll go through
[1:22:22] with you through your circumstance.
[1:22:24] He'll walk with you through sickness and
[1:22:26] trials and situation. He'll walk with
[1:22:29] you when you face a giant in your life.
[1:22:36] A God who matters. A God that can come
[1:22:39] and change every situation in just a
[1:22:42] moment.
[1:22:51] Hallelujah. He says, he as I say this,
[1:22:54] my brother, he's come from glory this
[1:22:56] afternoon to set any one of you free.
[1:23:00] He'll come down through every church,
[1:23:01] every critic, everything else, every
[1:23:03] fanatic, everything else to you, to heal
[1:23:06] you, to make you right. Don't you
[1:23:07] believe that? Yes, sir. Don't let him
[1:23:09] just let just just let him find one
[1:23:11] sincere heart that he can get into.
[1:23:14] He'll come anytime, any hour of the
[1:23:15] night. I'm so thankful we have a doctor
[1:23:17] that'll come anytime. I'm so happy to
[1:23:20] know that we have a refuge and strength,
[1:23:22] a very present time, help in the time of
[1:23:24] trouble. He said, I remember sometime
[1:23:26] all you know, he said, I was up in
[1:23:28] person in nature and he said, I love to
[1:23:29] go hunting. And he said, I I was in a
[1:23:31] situation, you know, remember the story?
[1:23:33] He gets up on the mountain, his wife and
[1:23:35] little son's down in the cabin and he
[1:23:36] gets lost.
[1:23:41] I I I you talking about grace. I love
[1:23:44] that God shows us what really great that
[1:23:46] a prophet could get lost.
[1:23:50] Could get turned around. Could, you
[1:23:53] know, kind of find misfire. I'm not
[1:23:54] talking about in the word. You know what
[1:23:55] I'm talking about. And and in in in his
[1:23:58] everyday life, could just find himself
[1:24:00] in the spot. He don't know what to do.
[1:24:03] He don't know what to turn where to
[1:24:04] turn. He done tried. And he he finds and
[1:24:07] his words are he said, "I'm going to put
[1:24:09] my face this way and I'm going to walk
[1:24:10] this way with all my heart." And he said
[1:24:12] he comes right back around and he finds
[1:24:14] him right where he left again. Same
[1:24:16] spot. Called it the Indian death walk.
[1:24:22] Some of y'all been doing that for a long
[1:24:24] time.
[1:24:27] I'm going to go this way after this camp
[1:24:29] and I'm going to do this and I'm going
[1:24:31] to do this and I'm going to do this and
[1:24:32] you come right back and the next camp
[1:24:34] you're right at the same spot
[1:24:39] and I'm going to do this and I'm going
[1:24:40] to do this and I'm going to do that. I'm
[1:24:42] not going to do that no more. And you
[1:24:43] come right around and you come right to
[1:24:45] the last same spot.
[1:24:48] As long as you're trying on your own,
[1:24:50] you're always going to come right back
[1:24:52] to the same spot.
[1:24:55] long as you're trying to rely on your
[1:24:56] own abilities and your own strength and
[1:24:58] you're not giving your whole heart to
[1:25:00] the Lord and you're not surrendering
[1:25:01] your all and you're not laying your own
[1:25:03] thoughts down, you're going to come back
[1:25:05] to the same spot.
[1:25:08] But he said there was a moment I started
[1:25:11] going. He started started hearing a
[1:25:12] voice. You remember when he
[1:25:14] started started hearing a voice speak to
[1:25:16] him, I'm the everpresent help in the
[1:25:19] time of trouble.
[1:25:21] Maybe that's what you heard all weekend.
[1:25:22] I'm the everpresent help. I'm the blood
[1:25:25] that covers. I'm the unlimited force.
[1:25:33] Come on. I'm the grace that you need.
[1:25:39] I have I have determined your path. I am
[1:25:42] marking out your way. You just put
[1:25:44] yourself in my hands and I'll lead you
[1:25:46] to the place you need to go. And he said
[1:25:48] he started to go again on his own way.
[1:25:50] And he said all of a sudden a hand
[1:25:52] turned him. He said he turned him around
[1:25:55] and he said about that time the clouds
[1:25:57] will roll back and he said he caught a
[1:25:59] glimpse of hurricane mountain.
[1:26:03] I'm believing with all my heart, brother
[1:26:05] Wendle. Amen. There's a hand that's been
[1:26:07] on some young people this evening or
[1:26:09] this weekend that turned them around and
[1:26:11] they caught a glimpse of something
[1:26:13] greater than themselves. They caught a
[1:26:15] glimpse of something that really
[1:26:17] matters.
[1:26:20] And he said he knew between him and that
[1:26:22] mountain was a lifeline. And if he kept
[1:26:24] his hands up in surrenderance, he would
[1:26:27] get the lifeline.
[1:26:31] Oh, come on, somebody. Do we got anybody
[1:26:34] that say, "God, I want to continue to
[1:26:36] walk in surrenderance.
[1:26:38] I want to continue to walk as you want
[1:26:40] me to walk. I'm going to keep my eyes on
[1:26:42] you. I'm not going to look at our
[1:26:44] mountains or the valleys around me. I'm
[1:26:46] not going to look at the enemy that's
[1:26:48] around me. I want to look at Jesus
[1:26:50] Christ. I'm walking towards him with all
[1:26:53] my
[1:27:01] heart. Help hearing that I'm the Lord.
[1:27:04] I'm a very present help in the time of
[1:27:07] trouble. And all at once, he said,
[1:27:10] "Sure," his hands got tired. Sure, he
[1:27:12] wanted to drop them down, but he just
[1:27:14] kept them up.
[1:27:17] Keep your hands up, children of
[1:27:20] God. Don't let the devil take you back
[1:27:23] to your past or take you back to the
[1:27:26] things you've done and regrets and
[1:27:28] failures and before you know it, he's
[1:27:29] piling all kind of that stuff don't
[1:27:31] matter.
[1:27:34] It's gone. It's finished. It's done.
[1:27:36] It's annihilated.
[1:27:46] You know, we're not careful. I think I
[1:27:49] mentioned this the other day. I don't
[1:27:50] know. I'm
[1:27:51] old. I did mention this. I don't have no
[1:27:54] children of my own here at the first
[1:27:55] youth camp, but I do have a grandson
[1:27:56] now. That's pretty
[1:27:58] awesome. Makes it worth getting old,
[1:28:00] don't it, brother
[1:28:03] Sean? Brother Ben, don't laugh. You're
[1:28:05] coming right behind
[1:28:09] us. I've been reading the tea leaves.
[1:28:15] And here we are. We become spiritual
[1:28:19] hoarders. You know what a hoarder is?
[1:28:21] They keep stuff that don't matter.
[1:28:27] Hello. They got houses of stuff that
[1:28:30] don't matter.
[1:28:32] If it was gone tomorrow, it wouldn't
[1:28:34] matter
[1:28:36] cuz it ain't mattered enough for them to
[1:28:38] even go look at it in four or five
[1:28:40] years. So why would it matter if it's
[1:28:41] gone?
[1:28:43] But they become hoarders and they pile
[1:28:44] all kinds of stuff up. And I've seen
[1:28:46] people in the message are Christians
[1:28:48] that will just become hoarders. They
[1:28:50] they carrying around baggages of
[1:28:51] bitterness and baggages of unforgiveness
[1:28:54] and baggages of hurts and baggage.
[1:28:59] You say, "Well, brother Timothy, amen.
[1:29:01] This one done this to me. This one done
[1:29:03] I was abused. I was this. I was that."
[1:29:05] Amen. Let me I'm not trying to minimize
[1:29:07] your hurt. As far as I understand
[1:29:08] there's real hurts, but what matters is
[1:29:11] a God who's bigger than your hurt.
[1:29:14] There's a God who's got a bomb in
[1:29:16] Gilead. He can wash it all away. He can
[1:29:19] take that hurt and that scar and he can
[1:29:21] put the bomb of Gilead on it and you
[1:29:24] don't have to bear it no more. That's
[1:29:26] what I'm talking about. Listen, I I
[1:29:28] believe this weekend we ought to have a
[1:29:30] good burning session.
[1:29:33] Why don't we this morning determine in
[1:29:35] my heart, I'm going to burn every
[1:29:36] unforgiven spirit. I'm going to burn
[1:29:39] every bitterness. I'm going to burn
[1:29:41] everything that's held me back. And I'm
[1:29:43] going to go with Jesus with my whole
[1:29:47] heart. With everything I have, I listen.
[1:29:52] You will never hit that lifeline holding
[1:29:55] on to something else. You got to put
[1:29:57] both hands in the air. You got to let go
[1:30:00] of worldly pleasures. You got to let go
[1:30:02] of everything that would so easily beset
[1:30:04] you and run.
[1:30:15] John 14:1 says, "Let not your heart be
[1:30:23] troubled. Ye believe in God, believe
[1:30:25] also in me, because in my father's
[1:30:28] houses are many mansions.
[1:30:31] Oh, I can't
[1:30:32] wait. We got all these ideas of
[1:30:35] mansions, man. I want, you know, we've
[1:30:38] dreamed of mansions. If I could just
[1:30:40] build a certain house, if I can have
[1:30:41] just so many bedrooms. I I want to put a
[1:30:43] fireplace or two in. I want this, that,
[1:30:45] and the other. That ain't the mansion
[1:30:46] he's talking about. I know the world
[1:30:49] picks it. I want the golden door knobs
[1:30:51] and I want
[1:30:54] the I tell you the mansion he's talking
[1:30:56] about. I have prepared a mansion. It's a
[1:31:00] new body.
[1:31:02] You talking about the best mansion you
[1:31:04] ever lived in.
[1:31:07] Cuz any mansion you can build here on
[1:31:09] earth, Amen. There's been men that has
[1:31:11] spent fortunes on mansions that today
[1:31:13] are were wallered up with cobwebs. They
[1:31:16] got every kind of un insect and rat
[1:31:19] running through them. Amen. And lost the
[1:31:21] history of what went on and who was
[1:31:23] there and what dignitary walked in
[1:31:25] there, what happened. It didn't matter.
[1:31:27] It don't matter no more.
[1:31:31] Amen. But let me tell you about a
[1:31:33] mansion. I got a mansion that's about
[1:31:35] this tall.
[1:31:39] He's got about he he ain't got all this
[1:31:41] gray hair that's coming in.
[1:31:51] They got some mansion that they got all
[1:31:53] the hair.
[1:31:57] You know, brother Timothy, I'm a young
[1:31:59] man and I tell you right now, I I got
[1:32:01] the looks. I got everything put
[1:32:03] together. I got muscles on top of
[1:32:05] muscles on top of muscles on top of
[1:32:08] muscles. Well, let me tell you, that's
[1:32:10] just more to deteriorate.
[1:32:15] I was at a place one time in Florida and
[1:32:17] there was a man that I found out later
[1:32:19] that one time was one of the star was a
[1:32:21] star football player. He was a giant
[1:32:23] fellow. But I watched him as he come
[1:32:26] into into the into the restaurant and
[1:32:29] somebody later would tell me who he was
[1:32:31] and he was he was decrepit and he was
[1:32:33] bent over and he he sat down just you
[1:32:35] know plopped down on a seat and he he
[1:32:37] sat there out of breath and and here all
[1:32:40] of his life his ambitions had went
[1:32:42] before him and he had lived out his
[1:32:43] dreams and he had conquered a lot of
[1:32:45] enemies. He had done a lot of things. He
[1:32:47] maybe scored a lot of touchdowns. He may
[1:32:49] have blocked for a lot of I don't know
[1:32:50] what position he was a big old dude but
[1:32:53] now he's wore out now he's beat down and
[1:32:57] I watched him later as he would struggle
[1:32:59] to get out of that
[1:33:03] seat and on my mind I'm wondering I
[1:33:06] always think about this what what really
[1:33:09] matters to them
[1:33:17] now what really matters matters. Does it
[1:33:20] really matter that they blocked for so
[1:33:22] many touchdowns or they made so many
[1:33:23] touchdowns or they scored so many goals
[1:33:25] or they won so many gold medals or they
[1:33:27] did this? Listen, we're not after a
[1:33:29] corruptible crown, but an incorruptible
[1:33:33] crown. I tell you what's going to matter
[1:33:36] is one day I'm going to feel something
[1:33:38] change come over me and I'm going to
[1:33:40] step out of this old body, this old veil
[1:33:42] of flesh, and I'm going to step into a
[1:33:44] new body that ain't never had a mind
[1:33:47] battle. Ain't never for face depression.
[1:33:50] Ain't never had anxiety or fear and all
[1:33:53] of that to be washed away and gone away
[1:33:55] from me. Never again will I have to face
[1:33:58] that old devil and his sliminess get all
[1:34:00] over me. But I'll be able to walk to the
[1:34:02] hills of glory shouting the victory.
[1:34:05] That's all that
[1:34:09] [Applause]
[1:34:13] matters. Sure, I understand. You need to
[1:34:15] prepare for life. you need to plant your
[1:34:17] potatoes and all that stuff, but don't
[1:34:19] let that become more that matters to you
[1:34:21] than eternal
[1:34:24] values. Prophet of God would say it like
[1:34:27] this, and it's one of those key quotes
[1:34:29] to me. Amen. No matter what you are, who
[1:34:31] you are, how successful you become,
[1:34:33] without Christ, you've totally lost
[1:34:36] everything.
[1:34:39] You can have diplomas to go across your
[1:34:41] bedroom and around and circle around and
[1:34:43] touch the other side. That won't matter
[1:34:46] when it comes to your last breath. You
[1:34:48] can have sports awards and trophies and
[1:34:51] all kinds of things. That won't matter
[1:34:52] when it comes to your last breath. And
[1:34:54] let me tell you, you may not be 50 years
[1:34:57] old when you reach your last breath or
[1:34:59] 70 or 80. It might be in just a moment.
[1:35:02] We don't know when our time is.
[1:35:07] But what matters is do you know your
[1:35:10] God?
[1:35:14] David would say it like this. Oh God,
[1:35:17] thou art my God.
[1:35:22] I hope that's really touched some of you
[1:35:24] that you can have that revelation. It's
[1:35:26] not just Brother Andrew's God,
[1:35:29] but I met the same one brother Andrew
[1:35:32] met when he was a 12 year old boy. And
[1:35:35] the same one that brought him to here
[1:35:36] last night to preach in a powerful way,
[1:35:39] anointed by the power of almighty God is
[1:35:41] the same God. If you meet that same one
[1:35:45] and he does the same thing on the inside
[1:35:47] of you when you get to be 30 years old,
[1:35:49] he'll still be holding you. When you get
[1:35:52] in your trials and your
[1:35:56] situations, you say, "Well, I didn't
[1:35:57] come from a good family. I didn't come
[1:35:59] from a good bloodline." That don't
[1:36:01] matter.
[1:36:06] This message is not
[1:36:09] about what what family you come from.
[1:36:15] I know preachers like to make it that.
[1:36:16] Well, if I had that last name, I'd have
[1:36:18] a message. I'd have a a ministry, too.
[1:36:20] It ain't got nothing to do about a last
[1:36:23] name. Is it is it apostolic succession
[1:36:26] that they call it where they hand it
[1:36:27] down from one person to another? That's
[1:36:30] not what this is about.
[1:36:32] much as I would love to. I'd love to
[1:36:34] hand amen the God that I know down to my
[1:36:36] children, but I can't. Sure, I can show
[1:36:40] them what who he is and try to show show
[1:36:43] it live. I can do things and you know
[1:36:44] what I mean, but I cannot hand this life
[1:36:46] and say it's yours now. No, they have to
[1:36:49] experience for themselves.
[1:36:54] And neither is a God called man a God-
[1:36:56] called man because his daddy was a God-
[1:36:58] called man.
[1:37:01] Hey, I faced that all my life. You know,
[1:37:03] you're just this because you got a
[1:37:05] certain last name or you're just this
[1:37:06] because, you know, your daddy done this
[1:37:08] and your daddy. Listen, I want you to
[1:37:10] understand, I had to meet the same God
[1:37:12] my dad met. I had to meet him for
[1:37:14] myself. And it had to become a reality
[1:37:16] for me. It wasn't good enough when I got
[1:37:18] my trial to say, "Daddy, God, dad's God,
[1:37:21] where you at?" I had to have my own
[1:37:23] experience. I had to have my own God I
[1:37:26] could call on in my time of need and God
[1:37:29] would come down and he would answer me
[1:37:32] in my
[1:37:45] request
[1:37:48] conditions. Listen to this. He said he's
[1:37:50] here to meet you in every condition.
[1:37:53] He's a very present help in the time of
[1:37:55] trouble. So conditions don't
[1:37:58] matter. What matters is he's able to
[1:38:00] meet any condition.
[1:38:03] Listen, you may leave here and find
[1:38:04] yourself in the worst storm ever in your
[1:38:08] life. But as long as Jesus is in your
[1:38:10] boat,
[1:38:13] what does it
[1:38:16] matter? If they would have really
[1:38:18] listened to what he said, he before they
[1:38:20] even got in a boat, he said, "Let's go
[1:38:22] over to the other side.
[1:38:25] That should have been all that
[1:38:27] mattered, right? His word spoke. Let's
[1:38:31] go over to the other side." But they get
[1:38:33] out in the middle of it. He falls
[1:38:34] asleep. He's resting upon what he had
[1:38:37] spoke. He knew it was going to come to
[1:38:38] pass. He wasn't worried about winds or
[1:38:40] waves or boats rocking and filling up
[1:38:42] with water. He could care less about
[1:38:43] that. His word was already spoke.
[1:38:47] But all of a sudden it be to matter to
[1:38:49] some disciples. Hey, wait a minute.
[1:38:50] We're about to drown. These winds are
[1:38:52] bad. These waves are coming in. Get a
[1:38:54] bucket.
[1:38:58] Let me tell you, when you're in the
[1:38:59] middle of it, your bucket ain't going to
[1:39:00] matter. What's going to matter is your
[1:39:03] God.
[1:39:08] What do you mean b my bucket don't
[1:39:09] matter? I Well, let me tell you. There
[1:39:11] was a little woman that came to a
[1:39:14] well and on the side of this well set a
[1:39:18] man had a divine appointment that took
[1:39:20] place in that day in that moment. He's
[1:39:23] sitting there waiting on her to come. He
[1:39:25] knew her
[1:39:26] condition. He knew he proved he did
[1:39:29] later. He he would speak what her
[1:39:31] condition was. But here he come and he
[1:39:33] says,"Woman, give me a
[1:39:35] drink." And she said, "Why would you ask
[1:39:38] me of a drink? you know, you're of a
[1:39:39] different race and we ain't supposed to
[1:39:40] be mingling and all this stuff mattered
[1:39:43] to
[1:39:45] her. See, that's what the world wants
[1:39:47] you to get your eyes upon, you know, is
[1:39:50] it matters what race you are. It
[1:39:52] matters.
[1:39:57] This message is not about race. Well,
[1:40:00] let me say it's about the God race.
[1:40:03] It's not about black, yellow, red,
[1:40:05] white, blue. It don't matter. Amen. What
[1:40:07] matters is is you have God on the inside
[1:40:10] of you that rewrote your life and he
[1:40:12] rewrote your history and he rewrote your
[1:40:14] bloodline. And now it ain't the blood of
[1:40:17] of Tim and Karen Puit that's operating
[1:40:19] inside of you and orchestrating who you
[1:40:21] are, but it's the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:23] that has overrode all of that.
[1:40:26] That's what matters.
[1:40:30] And he she said, well, he said, well, if
[1:40:32] you knew who I was, you would ask for me
[1:40:33] from me a drink. What did she say? She
[1:40:37] said, "You ain't got no water pot.
[1:40:43] How are you going to get anything out of
[1:40:45] this well? How are you going to do
[1:40:47] this?" Well, she didn't realize that
[1:40:49] wasn't what mattered in the moment. That
[1:40:51] wasn't the water he was talking about.
[1:40:54] But as the story goes on, and you know
[1:40:56] the story, she he begins to take her
[1:40:58] through all of her religious things and
[1:41:00] all the way down to she finally
[1:41:01] realized, "Oh, you're a prophet." And
[1:41:04] then all of a sudden she realized this
[1:41:06] is the Messiah.
[1:41:08] See, she come in at a certain surface
[1:41:10] and he took her to the depths.
[1:41:13] And the scripture says, if you'll read
[1:41:15] your Bible, when she went to go tell
[1:41:17] everybody what happened, she left her
[1:41:20] water pot.
[1:41:24] Something that mattered to her in the
[1:41:26] beginning no longer matters anymore.
[1:41:29] Amen. This is what I pray happened to
[1:41:31] you this weekend. You came with
[1:41:33] everything that you thought that
[1:41:35] mattered and you thought this mattered.
[1:41:37] You thought that mattered and you had
[1:41:38] this idea about this, but all of a
[1:41:41] sudden you went from this way down into
[1:41:43] the depths and God took you to a place
[1:41:46] you realize that stuff will never quench
[1:41:49] my
[1:41:50] thirst. Amen. How many times has she
[1:41:53] came day after day after day to that
[1:41:56] well
[1:41:57] and it never quenched her thirst. It
[1:42:00] might have been a temporary thing, but
[1:42:01] she would get thirsty again. But when
[1:42:03] she met the real drink of water, she
[1:42:06] never thirsted again.
[1:42:13] I trust at this camp there'll be a lot
[1:42:16] of water pots left behind.
[1:42:25] The devil says, "I'm going to sink
[1:42:26] them." They leave this camp, I'm going
[1:42:29] to sink them. They They just going to
[1:42:31] They going to be by themselves. I'm
[1:42:33] going to catch them out in that
[1:42:35] place. I've caught them there
[1:42:40] before. I caught him there
[1:42:43] before. I'll catch him
[1:42:46] again. And here comes this little boat
[1:42:48] pushing through the waves, pushing
[1:42:50] through the water. and he begins to whip
[1:42:52] up the storms, whip up the winds, whip
[1:42:54] it all up, and it's bouncing and
[1:42:56] carrying on. Wow. I was just a few days
[1:42:58] ago, I was in I was at that youth camp
[1:43:00] in Oklahoma. What happened? Don't forget
[1:43:03] who's in your
[1:43:08] boat. I pray this camp you won't leave
[1:43:10] without him in your boat cuz you're
[1:43:13] going to go through some more winds and
[1:43:14] you're going to go through some more
[1:43:15] waves. You're going to go through some
[1:43:17] situations in your life that you can't
[1:43:19] handle. But listen, there's a God that
[1:43:21] can go with you. There's a God that can
[1:43:24] get in your car and go wherever you go.
[1:43:26] He can go to your job. He can go to your
[1:43:28] bedroom. He can go to your situation. Go
[1:43:30] to your private life.
[1:43:34] And he can stand on the side of your
[1:43:35] boat and say, "Peace, be still."
[1:43:40] Hallelujah. That's all that matters.
[1:43:43] What matters is we got Jesus.
[1:43:47] We got Jesus. Amen. And I'm so thankful
[1:43:50] to know we are not in a revival that
[1:43:52] went off without him. We're in a revival
[1:43:54] that has him in our boat. We're in a
[1:43:56] revival that God is coming this day the
[1:43:59] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:44:01] Yeah, the storms may get bad. The winds
[1:44:03] may blow. But I'm here to say it'll take
[1:44:06] a stronger wind than
[1:44:10] this. Hallelujah. Is there any young
[1:44:13] person that'll make that declaration?
[1:44:15] It's going to take a stronger win. It's
[1:44:18] going to take a stronger win cuz God is
[1:44:21] on my side. And if God be before me, who
[1:44:24] can be against
[1:44:27] me? I got
[1:44:30] Jesus. Therefore, I got
[1:44:34] everything. When my hopes are gone, I
[1:44:36] got Jesus. When my sick, I'm sick. I got
[1:44:39] Jesus. When I'm down in the dumps, I got
[1:44:41] Jesus.
[1:44:49] [Music]
[1:44:51] Hallelujah. Remember, he's ever with
[1:44:55] you. Everything. He's everything to re
[1:44:59] remedy every cause that the devil can
[1:45:01] start. Oh, I like that. He's in the
[1:45:05] boat. He's in the
[1:45:08] ship. Brother Brandon would take the
[1:45:10] rapture text in Psalms 27 verse1. The
[1:45:12] Lord is my light and my salvation.
[1:45:16] Whom shall I
[1:45:19] fear the So that tells me in the rapture
[1:45:23] age there's going to be things that try
[1:45:25] to make you
[1:45:27] afraid but whom shall I fear? The Lord
[1:45:31] is a strength of my life. Of whom shall
[1:45:33] I be afraid? When the wicked, even my
[1:45:36] enemies and my foes come to eat my
[1:45:38] flesh, they stumble and fall. Though a
[1:45:41] host shall encamp against me, my heart
[1:45:43] shall not fear. The war shall rise
[1:45:44] against me, and this will I be
[1:45:46] confident. One thing I've desired of the
[1:45:48] Lord, and I will seek after,
[1:45:52] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:45:54] Lord all the days of my life, to behold
[1:45:56] the beauty of the Lord, inquire in his
[1:45:58] temple. For in the time of trouble, he
[1:46:01] shall hide me in his pavilion. In the
[1:46:03] secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
[1:46:05] me, he shall set me on a rock.
[1:46:11] Psalms 37 says, "But the verse 39 says,
[1:46:13] "The salvation of the righteousness of
[1:46:15] the Lord, he is their strength in the
[1:46:18] time of trouble, and the Lord shall help
[1:46:20] them and deliver them." He shall deliver
[1:46:22] them from the wicked and save them
[1:46:25] because they trust in him.
[1:46:29] Psalms
[1:46:32] 46, I'm going have to go over that one.
[1:46:35] Let me get my Bible. I just got the
[1:46:36] first verse, but that's one of my
[1:46:38] favorite scriptures. You mind going
[1:46:41] through this as we bring this down this
[1:46:44] morning? God is our refuge.
[1:46:51] Your room ain't your refuge.
[1:47:00] Truly, people ain't your true refuge.
[1:47:02] Sure, you can find comfort around
[1:47:04] certain people. I understand. That's not
[1:47:06] what I'm saying. God is your refuge
[1:47:09] because he's the only one that ain't
[1:47:10] going to walk away when the winds get
[1:47:12] rough.
[1:47:14] He's the only one that's going to be
[1:47:15] still standing there when the winds of
[1:47:17] hell are blowing. God is our refuge, a
[1:47:20] very present help in trouble. Therefore
[1:47:23] will we will not we fear, though the
[1:47:26] earth be removed, and though the
[1:47:28] mountains be carried unto the mist of
[1:47:30] the sea. Though the waters therefore
[1:47:32] roar roar and be troubled, though the
[1:47:34] mountains shake with the swelling
[1:47:35] thereof. Say,
[1:47:38] do you know what that means? That means
[1:47:40] to pause and calmly think about
[1:47:43] this. What did I just not read about
[1:47:46] mountains falling in and rivers roaring
[1:47:48] and waters being troubled and mountains
[1:47:51] shaking?
[1:47:53] pause and calmly think about it. How can
[1:47:57] you be so calm? Because I'm not by
[1:48:00] myself.
[1:48:06] I'm not even with a preacher. I'm not
[1:48:08] even just with friends. I'm with the God
[1:48:10] who created
[1:48:12] everything. I'm with him.
[1:48:17] I've I've used this over and over, but I
[1:48:19] just say somebody maybe didn't hear it.
[1:48:22] I've seen this little cartoon drawing of
[1:48:24] this dumb
[1:48:25] sheep. Dorkiest looking sheep you ever
[1:48:28] seen in your
[1:48:30] life. He apparently didn't spend a whole
[1:48:32] lot of time in front of the
[1:48:36] mirror. Buck
[1:48:41] teeth. Well, I got y'all's attention on
[1:48:43] What are you gonna say next, Brother
[1:48:44] Timothy?
[1:48:47] Uh, and he's standing there. It's a
[1:48:50] cartoon. He's on his back feet. We know
[1:48:51] they walk on two feet, but for sakes for
[1:48:53] the sake of sheep, we got some
[1:48:56] two-feeded sheep
[1:48:58] today. I hope we got some sheep in here
[1:49:00] this
[1:49:05] morning. I got to
[1:49:08] behave. But he's standing there and he's
[1:49:10] walking down this road and he's holding
[1:49:12] the hand of Jesus.
[1:49:16] And you can tell this sheep ain't got no
[1:49:18] ability to do nothing. He is a
[1:49:25] dork and he's walking down. It looks
[1:49:28] like his legs are all shaky and
[1:49:30] everything. He ain't got a whole lot of
[1:49:31] strength, but he's holding on to the
[1:49:33] hand of Jesus. And over there in the
[1:49:35] ditch is a lion that's roaring and
[1:49:40] he's and his sheep is looking like,
[1:49:42] "What are you doing,
[1:49:44] dummy?" So that's the that's the look.
[1:49:46] I'm just telling what he look like. What
[1:49:47] are you doing, dummy? I'm with him.
[1:49:52] This is what he's saying. They said,
[1:49:54] "I'm with him."
[1:49:59] Come on, somebody.
[1:50:02] I hope you are the sheep that are gonna
[1:50:04] leave this camp and you're walking with
[1:50:06] Jesus and all of a sudden that line of
[1:50:08] roar and say, "I'm coming." What are you
[1:50:11] doing, dummy?
[1:50:13] What are you doing, stupid? I'm with
[1:50:15] him. Don't you know he's the one that
[1:50:17] broke your back? Don't you know he's the
[1:50:20] one who took the power fray away from
[1:50:22] you from the death, hell, and the
[1:50:27] grave? Come on. It's time you look at
[1:50:30] your enemy for what he really is. He's
[1:50:33] not a giant. He's under your feet.
[1:50:38] What you doing,
[1:50:42] dummy? How dare you come against the
[1:50:45] army of the living God? If God be for
[1:50:48] us, who can be against us?
[1:50:54] What shall we say? Let's stand. What
[1:50:56] shall we say to these things? If God be
[1:50:58] for us, who can be against us? Who shall
[1:51:02] lay anything to the charge of God's
[1:51:04] elect? Who is he that condemnth?
[1:51:11] Satan, with your lies and your accusing,
[1:51:14] it don't matter.
[1:51:19] For what shall separate me from the love
[1:51:21] of Christ? Let me hear you now with
[1:51:23] tribulation.
[1:51:27] There's a couple of you. I don't want to
[1:51:30] be too loud. Brother
[1:51:32] Timothy. Distress,
[1:51:35] persecution,
[1:51:37] famine, nakedness, peril, sword.
[1:51:41] But for thy sake, we're killed all the
[1:51:42] day long. We're counted as sheep for the
[1:51:45] slaughter. Uhoh. But nay, in all these
[1:51:49] things, we are more than conquerors.
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:51:55] I'm not looking at just conquerors. I'm
[1:51:57] looking at more than conquerors.
[1:52:01] For I am
[1:52:04] persuaded. That means you got your mind
[1:52:06] made up. There ain't nothing that can
[1:52:09] stalk you out of it. Especially
[1:52:11] something that's insignificant, has no
[1:52:13] power or no authority. It can't talk you
[1:52:17] out of it. cuz I've heard a voice from
[1:52:19] another land and it said neither death
[1:52:21] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:52:25] nor present nor powers nor present
[1:52:27] things to come height death or any
[1:52:30] creature shall be able to separate
[1:52:34] me devil I'm here to tell you me and God
[1:52:37] are inseparable
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:51] more.
[1:52:55] Hallelujah. Where you at today, church?
[1:52:58] Don't
[1:52:59] tremble. Don't worry about it. Don't
[1:53:02] fear that devil. Sure, he gonna be
[1:53:04] waiting out there. We ain't we ain't we
[1:53:06] ain't dumb enough to believe he
[1:53:09] ain't always going to
[1:53:14] come. He's always going to try to come
[1:53:17] and talk you out of what you got or what
[1:53:18] you received or try to bring you down
[1:53:21] and try to tear you apart. But if you'll
[1:53:24] not rely on self and self
[1:53:27] abilities, but you'll rely on what the
[1:53:29] word was spoke this weekend. This word
[1:53:32] has life in it. It is the life
[1:53:38] and say Lord I want to leave this camp
[1:53:42] and I want to keep my hands up Lord. I
[1:53:45] want to keep myself in a place of
[1:53:47] surrenderance that Lord I can stay in
[1:53:49] your will and not your way. I I can walk
[1:53:52] in your paths and your duties and I I I
[1:53:54] can I can abide by the word of God that
[1:53:57] has been spoken and I can if if
[1:53:59] something tries to rise up, there'll be
[1:54:00] a nature on the inside now that overrule
[1:54:02] it and push it back down again to its
[1:54:06] place. If God be for you, who can be
[1:54:10] against
[1:54:11] you? Why don't you put your hands on one
[1:54:14] another? Brothers, brother and sisters,
[1:54:15] sister, we leave this place. Why don't
[1:54:17] you just pray?
[1:54:19] Ask God to go with each one because God
[1:54:22] can be with them when you can't
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:26] be. God can be there when you can't
[1:54:30] reach them on the phone or they can't
[1:54:32] reach you. God will still be
[1:54:34] there. God will be there when a pastor
[1:54:37] can't get to
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:45] you. I'm going to ask you right now. You
[1:54:48] heard the
[1:54:49] word. You heard the word all
[1:54:51] weekend. Now I want you to put in your
[1:54:54] voice and I want you to pray. I want you
[1:54:57] to talk to the Lord. I want you to call
[1:54:59] upon him. Preachers have prayed for you,
[1:55:02] but now you pray one for the other.
[1:55:05] There's strength in prayer. There's
[1:55:06] strength in numbers. There strength that
[1:55:09] right now being transferred believer to
[1:55:11] believer. Hallelujah. Why don't you just
[1:55:14] lift your voice and begin to pray for
[1:55:15] the one next to you? Just say, "Lord, be
[1:55:17] with them. Lord, comfort them during
[1:55:19] their trials and situations. Strengthen
[1:55:21] them,
[1:55:24] Lord." Yes, Jesus. Let them know they're
[1:55:28] not alone. Let them know they're not
[1:55:30] fighting by themselves, but you're
[1:55:32] fighting their battles for them. You're
[1:55:33] you're there with them, Lord.
[1:55:36] I
[1:55:39] Hallelujah. Father, we brought these
[1:55:41] words this morning. Just simple thought.
[1:55:44] Father, we can realize our enemy is a a
[1:55:47] defeated foe and he don't
[1:55:49] matter. What matters is your word. What
[1:55:53] matters is you and you're with us. So if
[1:55:55] you're with us, who can be against us?
[1:55:58] Father, may our young people receive
[1:56:00] strength in these meetings, Lord. Not
[1:56:02] just a strength, Lord, to carry them to
[1:56:04] the next, but but Lord, a strength
[1:56:06] that'll be with them, Father, to to
[1:56:08] fight every devil of hell. that they can
[1:56:11] grab their sword and they can realize
[1:56:13] I'm a son of Abraham. I'm a son of God.
[1:56:16] I I'm a daughter of God. I don't have to
[1:56:18] bow to this. I don't have to put up with
[1:56:20] this one more moment, but I can have my
[1:56:22] moment of victory and liberty in my room
[1:56:24] or wherever I am. I can have that peace
[1:56:27] that passes all understanding. I can
[1:56:30] have joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:56:32] I I can have these promises of God. It
[1:56:34] It's for me. It's not just for some
[1:56:36] preachers or or for a few elders, but
[1:56:39] it's for me,
[1:56:40] God. You brought it for
[1:56:43] me. You remembered me in my low
[1:56:46] estate. You spoke words of eternal life
[1:56:49] to me and you strengthened me. You
[1:56:53] touched
[1:56:54] me. Father, we love you,
[1:56:57] Lord. We praise you with all of our
[1:56:59] hearts. Amen.
[1:57:05] of Jesus,
[1:57:07] [Music]
[1:57:10] silver,
[1:57:13] that's what matters. I'd
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:19] rather than have
[1:57:22] riches untold.
[1:57:25] Oh, I'd
[1:57:28] rather have
[1:57:31] Jesus than have us.
[1:57:38] I'd
[1:57:40] rather be there. Yes, he by
[1:57:45] his heart. Oh, and to be

[1:58:58] I'd
[1:58:59] rather have
[1:59:02] Jesus than
[1:59:05] hold my faith.
[1:59:09] I'd
[1:59:11] rather be
[1:59:13] true to his
[1:59:17] holy than to
[1:59:19] be to
[1:59:21] be the
[1:59:25] king of a
[1:59:30] last
[1:59:33] be in
[1:59:42] catch. I'd
[1:59:44] [Music]
[1:59:53] ra this
[1:59:55] world
[1:59:58] a day. Today.
[2:00:02] [Music]
[2:00:04] Bless the
[2:00:06] Lord. You
[2:00:09] know, thinking of what
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:14] matters, what comes down to
[2:00:17] it. I know there's there's so much to
[2:00:22] attract you young people these days, far
[2:00:26] more than
[2:00:27] what I had when I was a young
[2:00:31] man. We didn't
[2:00:34] We didn't have a TV in our
[2:00:37] house and
[2:00:40] um you know
[2:00:42] so and and the phone the only phone we
[2:00:46] had was one with a cord that was hooked
[2:00:48] to the
[2:00:50] wall and
[2:00:53] u you know there
[2:00:56] wouldn't the the entertainment that we
[2:00:59] we had maybe we'd play pingpong with the
[2:01:02] family or we would
[2:01:05] uh sit and play a
[2:01:08] game. But you
[2:01:10] know what we done
[2:01:13] [Music]
[2:01:15] as
[2:01:17] kids? We worked for the
[2:01:20] Lord. Everything that we done was spent
[2:01:23] doing something for God.
[2:01:26] And
[2:01:27] um uh we mowed I I mowed the lawn for
[2:01:31] the
[2:01:33] church.
[2:01:35] I was always trying to do something for
[2:01:38] the Lord. We
[2:01:40] uh learned to play the
[2:01:43] guitar. I I'd borrow my brother
[2:01:45] Jonathan. You know, I was 12 years old.
[2:01:47] Jonathan was a little he was just a
[2:01:49] baby. And uh I' I' I'd get his little
[2:01:54] wagon, hook it up to my bike, and put my
[2:01:57] guitar on it. Mama, do you remember
[2:02:00] that? Put my guitar on it, and I'd go
[2:02:04] I'd go around and looking for for the
[2:02:07] elders that hadn't been to church in a
[2:02:08] while, and I'd go sing for them a little
[2:02:10] bit. And uh and then uh the nursing home
[2:02:16] started letting me come and sing over
[2:02:18] there. And then I really felt big when
[2:02:21] they let me dad dad introduced me to
[2:02:24] come and and witnessing in the jails and
[2:02:27] I'd take my guitar and and and go go uh
[2:02:31] sing and and witness to I was I was just
[2:02:35] I was I was just a young
[2:02:38] teenager. But I I'd done something for
[2:02:40] the Lord. And I and I want to say when
[2:02:43] you when you're under
[2:02:46] responsibility, when there's
[2:02:47] responsibility on your
[2:02:50] shoulders, you you've got to be in
[2:02:53] contact with the
[2:02:56] Lord. The greatest the the greatest tool
[2:03:00] of the devil is
[2:03:02] idleness. When you're
[2:03:05] idle, your mind then will just your
[2:03:09] mind. You pick up your phone and you're
[2:03:12] playing with this phone all the time.
[2:03:15] And that's the that's the biggest tool
[2:03:18] of the enemy, looking at things, doing
[2:03:22] things, YouTube, Facebook, whatever
[2:03:26] else, right?
[2:03:29] But if you'd make up your mind, Lord,
[2:03:31] you've done something for me in this
[2:03:33] camp. I'm going to go
[2:03:37] home and I'm going to do something for
[2:03:41] you. I I I asked my pastor, I I found
[2:03:45] some old cards, some cards that they had
[2:03:47] made up one time with, you know, had it
[2:03:50] had the church name on it and it had his
[2:03:51] little picture up there on it. And I I
[2:03:54] I'd seen that at the church. And uh uh I
[2:03:58] started I started putting little
[2:04:00] scripture verses on it when people
[2:04:01] didn't come to church. Amen. I just I'
[2:04:04] I'd drive around my back and I just go
[2:04:07] drop them in their mailbox and tell them
[2:04:08] we missed you. And yeah, that's that's I
[2:04:12] done
[2:04:12] [Music]
[2:04:14] that. Just something that I can do for
[2:04:17] the Lord. There is the opportunities are
[2:04:21] endless.
[2:04:24] Don't leave it for the deacons. Don't
[2:04:26] leave it for for for those around. Do
[2:04:29] something for the Lord.
[2:04:31] Amen.
[2:04:33] Cuz it doesn't matter whether you're up
[2:04:35] here or whether you are out uh out there
[2:04:39] mowing the lawn or encouraging somebody
[2:04:42] or you're working for the Lord. And I
[2:04:45] just want to say when we leave this
[2:04:47] place, Lord, I'm going to sign up for
[2:04:50] duty. Might not be the preacher, might
[2:04:53] not be the deacon, might not be the
[2:04:56] Sunday school teacher, but Lord, you can
[2:04:57] use me somewhere. How many wants to be
[2:05:00] used of the
[2:05:02] Lord?
[2:05:03] [Music]

[2:05:12] Lord. Amen. You that that song, I'm not

[2:06:01] tears. Times I've even questioned if my
[2:06:06] Lord was
[2:06:09] even had a time that old tempter. He
[2:06:14] says, "Why not turn
[2:06:17] around? Cuz you cannot get any
[2:06:21] further and you're only losing ground."
[2:06:25] But I'm not
[2:06:29] leaving. I'm not turning
[2:06:33] around. By the grace of God, I'll wear a
[2:06:38] shining crown.

[2:06:59] would you mind tell me there's something
[2:07:04] bothering me.

[2:07:11] let God's
[2:07:13] people are his purpose and
[2:07:18] determin to get right in your
[2:07:22] way to turn us off from the way of life
[2:07:27] to lead our souls all together. I'm not
[2:07:31] giving enough.
[2:07:34] I'm not turning
[2:07:38] around. Race of God I wear shine brown.

[2:14:08] but not this time. You got to go
[2:14:11] straight to arms. You've got to go over
[2:14:15] there and pick up every bit of your
[2:14:20] underwear, every sock. Make sure

[2:15:24] want you to pick up all of your trash
[2:15:27] and uh help help us out because you know
[2:15:30] at Camp Crossway we work till till late
[2:15:32] in the night cleaning up. We've done all
[2:15:34] that ourselves and u uh but but this
[2:15:38] this time here we're we're wanting to
[2:15:40] leave a good impression on these folks
[2:15:42] so that maybe they'll let us come back
[2:15:44] again next year. Y'all think we should
[2:15:45] try it?
[2:15:50] Amen. So so
[2:15:55] uh so let's let's pick up uh our our

[2:16:13] anything? Okay. All right. Well, um we
[2:16:18] say a great big God bless every one of
[2:16:20] you. Now, I just wonder just real quick,
[2:16:23] and I don't know if I should do this or
[2:16:25] or whether I should or shouldn't.
[2:16:29] We we we are
[2:16:33] um well no it's it's I'm just this is a
[2:16:36] serious question here. Uh we have
[2:16:39] thought about doing four services
[2:16:42] instead of six services next year and um
[2:16:46] uh we would still have the Thursday,
[2:16:49] Friday, Saturday and then Sunday
