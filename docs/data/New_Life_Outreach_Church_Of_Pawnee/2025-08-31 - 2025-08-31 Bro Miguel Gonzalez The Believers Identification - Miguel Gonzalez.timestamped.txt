[33:59] move off into our scriptures and and um
[34:03] we'd like to start here in John the 10th
[34:05] 10th chapter
[34:07] going to the
[34:10] start here 31st
[34:12] 31st verse and again it's just uh
[34:16] pleasure to be here here this evening
[34:17] and
[34:20] appreciate the
[34:23] uh invite to speak in front of you and
[34:27] and if we would we
[34:30] like to go ahead and start in our
[34:32] scripture there if you're there just say
[34:34] amen.
[34:35] John 10th chapter the 31st verse and the
[34:40] scripture reads like this.
[34:43] Then then the Jews took up stones again
[34:46] to stone him. Jesus Jesus answered them
[34:50] many good works have I shown you from my
[34:53] father. For which of the for which of
[34:56] those works do you ston me? Then Jesus
[34:59] answered him, saying, "Are then or the
[35:03] Jews answered him, saying, for a good
[35:06] work we stone thee not, but for
[35:07] blasphemy."
[35:09] &gt;&gt; And because that thou being a man makest
[35:12] thyself God.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered them, Is it not written
[35:16] in your law, I say, Ye are gods? If he
[35:21] called them gods unto whom the word of
[35:24] God came the and or the scriptures
[35:28] cannot be broken. Say ye of him whom the
[35:31] father hath sanctified and sent unto the
[35:34] world. Thou blasphemeth
[35:37] because I say I am a son of God. And if
[35:40] I do not the works of my father, believe
[35:42] me not. But if I do, if I do, though ye
[35:47] believe me not, believe the works that
[35:49] ye may know and believe that the Father
[35:52] is in me and I am in him. Let's just go
[35:55] to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father,
[35:57] we just love you, Lord. We want to thank
[35:59] you, Lord, for Lord, everything that you
[36:02] do for us. And we would just ask that
[36:03] you would just be with us in service,
[36:05] Lord. I would just pray the father that
[36:07] you would just take away any nervousness
[36:10] lord or lord anything that's from us
[36:12] that we could just speak your l speak
[36:14] your word lord and we would just ask
[36:17] father that you would just give us the
[36:18] word to speak lord to be able to help
[36:20] your people. We thank you for these
[36:22] things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You
[36:25] could be seated here this evening. And
[36:29] uh you know I was kind of thinking uh
[36:32] thinking about a few of these things
[36:33] kind of just combing through a little
[36:35] bit of um you know a little bit of the
[36:37] scriptures and some things I've been
[36:39] listening to and you know and um you
[36:42] know like I said just combing through
[36:44] these things I' uh I come up with a
[36:47] maybe a little something hopefully it's
[36:49] a benefit to you but it would be the uh
[36:52] believer's identification
[36:54] you know and um you know just thinking
[36:58] about the service this morning. How many
[37:00] of you all enjoyed the service this
[37:01] morning? Amen. Just uh fantastic service
[37:05] and
[37:07] believe we're right there in the vein
[37:08] and uh things are being said the way
[37:11] they're supposed to be said and and
[37:13] we're seeing the benefits of it. And so,
[37:15] uh, just wonderful service this morning.
[37:17] And, um, still kind of just recovering
[37:20] from the food. And, you know, I knew I
[37:22] had to speak tonight. And, you know, a
[37:24] lot of the ministers, you know, when
[37:25] they get out and they're like, man, you
[37:27] know, I can't eat. I'm nervous. I'm
[37:28] like, man, I I can't preach unless I
[37:30] eat. You know, I'm kind of the opposite.
[37:33] You know, I'm just like, I got to try to
[37:35] sneak in here and get as many plates of
[37:36] food as I can, you know, before I got to
[37:39] get out of here, you know. So, I sure
[37:41] appreciate all the sisters, you know,
[37:43] what they do after the service. You
[37:45] know, there's a there's a great ministry
[37:47] in feeding God's people. I promise you.
[37:49] And there is going to be a great reward.
[37:51] There's going to be a great reward for
[37:53] that, you know, and and um that uh you
[37:57] know, they just they do a lot. And you
[37:59] know, a lot of times, you know, I I do
[38:01] hear a lot of a lot of good things about
[38:03] the sermons that are preached, so we
[38:04] can't ask those out. But, you know, a
[38:07] lot of times I hear, you know, mainly
[38:09] from the brothers, but they're just
[38:10] like, man, you know, that's just
[38:11] wonderful food, you know, I'm just,
[38:15] you know, and so, but just uh just
[38:18] wonderful. And, you know, and as as I
[38:20] was kind as I was thinking about some of
[38:21] these things and I was kind of thinking
[38:23] about the topic of identity, you know,
[38:26] uh we kind of live in an age uh now
[38:30] where everything takes identity.
[38:32] everything that we do, everything that
[38:34] we, you know, you can't log onto your
[38:36] phone, you know, without facial
[38:39] recognition, you know, you can't really
[38:42] um you can't, you know, get into your
[38:44] email without there being some type of a
[38:46] password, you know, there's things that
[38:48] are also locked, you know, electronics
[38:50] that are locked, you know, by
[38:52] fingerprint, you know, and things like
[38:54] that. And all these things are are to do
[38:55] is to be able to try to identify who you
[38:58] are. So before that you go to records or
[39:01] before you start going in and moving
[39:02] into different things, you know, the the
[39:04] the computer or the piece of equipment
[39:07] or whatever that you're working on or
[39:09] operating in or whatever it is, they're
[39:10] just trying to make sure that it's the
[39:12] the rightful owner, it's the rightful
[39:14] user. So they use identification to be
[39:16] able to try to bridge that gap, you
[39:19] know. And um you know I don't know why
[39:20] I'm thinking about this now but I was
[39:23] you know I was kind of thinking about I
[39:24] believe it was one of Kobe's kids and
[39:26] you know and it just shows how smart
[39:28] this age is you know and and was one of
[39:30] Kobe's kids and and u I had heard that
[39:33] the they had locked their phone you know
[39:35] and kept they had the password locked on
[39:37] it so they'd figure out their password
[39:39] so they stopped from the password and
[39:41] they went to the they went to the
[39:43] fingerprint or they went to the facial
[39:45] recognition and and um you know they
[39:48] couldn't get into her phone So they get
[39:49] her phone and they would scan it across
[39:50] their face, you know, so they would try
[39:52] to get the facial recognition thing
[39:54] going, you know, and just how smart, you
[39:57] know, uh how smart the kids are
[39:59] nowadays, you know, and but those are
[40:01] the kinds of things, you know, that
[40:02] you're looking for and and u you know,
[40:05] just thinking about it, you know,
[40:06] everything's requiring identification,
[40:08] you know, because everybody wants to
[40:09] know who you are and what your
[40:11] intentions are, you know, in life. And
[40:13] you know and you know coming into this
[40:15] world when we first walked when we first
[40:17] came into this world you know uh we
[40:19] weren't born of a good nature you know
[40:22] our nature you know the scripture goes
[40:24] in it talks about our nature in some of
[40:26] these scriptures you know um if we go
[40:28] back and we can kind of look there in
[40:30] Psalms 51 is it says behold I was shapen
[40:33] in iniquity and in sinned and my mother
[40:36] conceived me
[40:37] &gt;&gt; you know and and thinking about this you
[40:39] know uh you know everybody's trying to
[40:41] identify with something especially In
[40:43] the world today, everybody's trying to,
[40:45] you know, like when you identify with a
[40:47] lot of people identify with a lot of
[40:49] different things, whether you're part of
[40:50] a book club, you know, there's there's
[40:52] there's characteristics inside of an
[40:54] individual that ties you to the book
[40:56] club, you know, or you might be part of
[40:59] a a football or a soccer club or
[41:02] something like that, you know, and
[41:03] there's a lot of things that might
[41:04] identify you back and forth with, you
[41:07] know, to be able like, oh, that guy's a
[41:08] soccer player, or oh yeah, that guy's a
[41:10] football player, you know, or or
[41:12] something like that or you might be part
[41:13] of, you know, you you you drive down the
[41:15] road and if anybody's been down the
[41:17] highways or anything like that, you
[41:18] know, you can identify, you know, those
[41:21] guys that are in biker, you know, that
[41:23] are into biking, you know, they they
[41:24] drive by and they got the loud
[41:26] motorcycles, you know, and they they got
[41:28] the patches and the leather jackets and
[41:30] and you know, all these different things
[41:31] and they're identifying that that that
[41:34] we're part of this club or we're part of
[41:36] this group or, you know, and a lot of
[41:37] times, you know, identification can be
[41:40] done simply by uh physical
[41:41] characteristics. You know, there's a lot
[41:43] of family traits and there's family uh
[41:45] resemblances that that go on even in
[41:48] our, you know, even right here where we
[41:50] at right now. You know, there's several
[41:52] families that you can identify by the
[41:54] characteristics, you know, that's there.
[41:55] who's with what family or or certain
[41:58] traits that begin to pass through. And a
[42:00] lot of those things you can kind of you
[42:02] can kind of pick and choose and you can
[42:03] pull things out, you know, and be like
[42:05] these people are identified with this or
[42:07] identify with that, you know, and and
[42:09] the world is all about identification
[42:11] and trying to place you or where you are
[42:14] and where you go, you know, but but you
[42:16] know, the world that we live in today,
[42:18] you know, we we realize, you know,
[42:19] coming into this coming into the world
[42:21] that we've we've all we've all face an
[42:25] identity crisis because we're all still
[42:27] looking and we're searching when we come
[42:29] into this world prior to Christ or
[42:32] searching for something that we can
[42:33] relate to that we can identify with
[42:36] something that we can be like oh you
[42:37] know this is something that I'm into or
[42:39] this is something that you know I would
[42:41] like to become or something like that
[42:43] you know and a lot of different people
[42:45] you know they identify with uh you know
[42:48] with their job they'll identify you know
[42:50] u you know being an electrician or they
[42:53] identify with being a plumber you know
[42:54] so they'll surround themselves with
[42:56] people with the same types of passions
[42:58] or they surround surround themselves
[42:59] with the people with the same types of
[43:02] ideas that help support their idea and
[43:04] you know and and a lot of times or or or
[43:07] there might be people that are like you
[43:08] know I'm going to identify you know I'd
[43:10] like to identify myself as you know a
[43:12] doctor you know I'd like to identify
[43:14] myself as a lawyer you know or or you
[43:17] know there's just certain things that
[43:18] people are they're reaching out to be
[43:20] able to try to find purpose or to be
[43:22] able to find some type of identification
[43:24] that that they can go into life and be
[43:27] be confident in who and what they are,
[43:30] you know, and we live in a society like
[43:32] that. We live in a society that there's
[43:34] a lot of young people who are trying to
[43:36] figure out who they are and and and
[43:38] they're trying to figure out, well, you
[43:39] know, uh is this what it takes to become
[43:41] a man or is this what it takes to become
[43:44] a woman, you know, and they're trying to
[43:45] identify. So, they're looking at peers
[43:48] or they're looking at people, you know,
[43:49] that that they're that they deem as as
[43:52] fit, you know, like a lot of those
[43:54] people are called cool people. You know,
[43:56] a lot of those people, you know, they're
[43:57] like, "Oh, this guy's cool. this girl's
[43:59] cool, you know, you know, these are the
[44:00] people that we're going to try to
[44:02] identify with, you know, but the but a
[44:04] lot of things that we find here on earth
[44:06] and and you know, young people and and a
[44:08] lot of the elders understand this that
[44:10] there's a lot of things that here on
[44:11] earth that won't last. And so, we're
[44:13] always as a as somebody that's older,
[44:16] we're looking at something that's going
[44:17] to be able, you know, not going to be
[44:19] just here today and gone tomorrow, you
[44:21] know, and you don't want to identify
[44:22] with something that doesn't have much of
[44:24] a foundation. You don't you know I
[44:26] wouldn't I wouldn't uh you know uh the
[44:28] world that we live in they try to
[44:30] identify themselves with stars or
[44:32] celebrities or they tried to or they try
[44:35] to become something that's just you know
[44:37] either it's Michael Jordan here or it's
[44:39] Kobe Bryant there you know or it's you
[44:42] know Joe Montana here you know or or or
[44:45] Jerry Rice here or it's this singer you
[44:48] know or it's this actor or it might be
[44:50] just something you know something like
[44:52] in a clothes like something that they
[44:54] whether it's glasses that they wear.
[44:56] It's the suits that they wear, the
[44:57] shoots, the shoes that they wear. And
[44:59] the next thing you know, you find all of
[45:01] society, all of society, you know,
[45:03] everybody is doing this, you know,
[45:04] because they're trying to identify with
[45:06] something that they think is cool as
[45:08] something that is something that that's
[45:10] just like up to up to the times and how
[45:12] everybody thinks or deems. But anybody
[45:14] that's been around or has seen anything
[45:16] or has experienced a time of of any
[45:19] great length or anything realize that a
[45:22] lot of these things are coming and
[45:23] going, you know, like there's not many
[45:25] people with afro now. You know, there's
[45:27] not not a whole lot of people going
[45:28] around sporting a fro with a comb, you
[45:30] know, a comb inside of the thing, you
[45:32] know. It's just something that, you
[45:33] know, you know, I I thought about if I
[45:35] could grow a fro, man, I would really
[45:37] like to grow a fro, you know, but that's
[45:38] just that's just not my time. It's just
[45:40] not not not what I'm supposed to be
[45:43] doing, you know. And but thinking about
[45:44] this, you know, the time is this world
[45:47] is fickle. You know, time is fickle. You
[45:49] know, that things just are coming and
[45:51] going. And you know, there's a lot of
[45:52] things that are that's going on in the
[45:54] world that, you know, it causes things
[45:56] to change. And, you know, we don't
[45:58] really want to be identified with
[46:00] something that doesn't have purpose in
[46:02] life. We don't want to be identified
[46:03] with something that that doesn't have a
[46:06] value or we don't want to be identified
[46:08] with something that doesn't have a
[46:09] doesn't have a sure footing or a
[46:11] foundation. You know, uh you could go
[46:13] back and you can look at a lot of these
[46:14] stars. You can look at uh, you know,
[46:16] whether they're whether they're sports
[46:17] stars or celebrities and you can see,
[46:20] you know, the the the tosses and or the
[46:22] turns and the different ways that they
[46:24] go and the routes that they take and and
[46:26] and and we don't necessarily we don't
[46:29] desire to be or we shouldn't have the
[46:31] desire to be become something like that
[46:34] because because anything that has to
[46:36] deal with man will fail, you know. I
[46:38] mean I mean we've got we got the story
[46:40] of the Titanic, you know, about how that
[46:42] we had thought that we built one of the
[46:44] greatest ships that there was and then
[46:45] and now it sits in the bottom of the
[46:47] ocean, you know, today, you know, I mean
[46:49] there's there's there's many great feats
[46:51] and there's different things that man
[46:52] has challenged, you know, has and has
[46:55] tried to become, but yet it'll never
[46:57] match the shity of God. And you know, a
[47:00] lot of the things that a lot of the
[47:01] stars and a lot of these a lot of these
[47:04] entertainers and a lot of the even the
[47:06] most successful people that may may have
[47:09] not reached that status can all look
[47:10] back and and they can all and they can
[47:13] all look back at religion first of all
[47:15] is because they look at religion.
[47:17] Religion has surrounded has surrounded
[47:19] Christ in such a way that you know it
[47:22] presents its image of it and and people
[47:24] want that they have that desire to have
[47:27] that sure footing. There's something
[47:28] that's within them, but yet there's
[47:30] nothing that really is able for them to
[47:32] be able to take that step and to be able
[47:34] to be able to walk into be able to walk
[47:37] on on that sure-footed uh foundation
[47:40] that Christ provides. And you know, and
[47:42] thinking about this, you know, that in
[47:44] this in this walk that we in in in in
[47:47] this walk that we have uh with the Lord,
[47:50] uh in our in our paths of life that we
[47:52] go down, you know, I begin to think
[47:53] about how that there's uh there's
[47:56] identity that we want to be able to
[47:58] take. You know, we come into this world
[48:00] and we realize that there's things about
[48:02] us that that we don't even like
[48:04] ourselves. Not only did did we not like
[48:06] it, but we realized that we need a
[48:08] change in our life. And that there's
[48:10] something that has to be done with it.
[48:12] And you know, there's a lot of programs
[48:14] that try to uh uh uh come in the way of
[48:17] that. And they it they try to help you
[48:19] to become a better person. But yet, but
[48:21] yet still at the end of the day, you
[48:23] realize that down deep inside that
[48:25] something needs to be different, that
[48:26] something needs to be changed. And and
[48:28] you could take a you could take all
[48:30] these people that we had talked about,
[48:31] famous people. You could take even even
[48:34] your peers, your your mom and dad and
[48:36] and and different people and and and
[48:39] realize that that they're they see
[48:42] something that we don't that it's not
[48:44] something that we could just walk into
[48:45] the middle of and and and all of a
[48:48] sudden we've arrived into a place of a
[48:50] total identification. But yet in this
[48:52] walk that we have with Jesus that we
[48:54] realize that we we don't have no ability
[48:57] within ourselves to be able to to you
[48:59] know forgive ourselves. I love how
[49:01] brother Window was talking this morning.
[49:02] He was talking about not being able to
[49:04] pull yourself up by your own bootstraps
[49:06] and not being able to uh come, but there
[49:09] had to be a slay lamb and to be able to
[49:11] come and and and give us the remission
[49:14] for our sins. But yet we need we come to
[49:16] a place where we realize that we don't
[49:18] have the ability that we don't have the
[49:20] equipment to be able to come into the in
[49:22] in the presence of God w uh w without
[49:25] condemnation being in our hearts without
[49:27] sin that had that had taken place you
[49:30] know in order for us to go further with
[49:33] God and that's why when we come to that
[49:35] place and we realize that you know what
[49:37] that all have come short and then all of
[49:40] us have come to a place in our lives
[49:42] where where sin was was abounding But
[49:44] yet there has to be a way that we can
[49:47] that we can take off of our old
[49:49] identity. Now there's a lot of there's
[49:51] an identity. You could call it a social
[49:55] a social standing. You could call it the
[49:57] pride of life. You could call it your
[49:58] your resume. There's a lot of things
[50:00] that there's a lot of things that we can
[50:02] we can look and we can name. You know,
[50:05] our reputation is another one that we
[50:07] could look at and you could say, "Well,
[50:08] you know, I have the reputation of this.
[50:10] You know, I'm a good person in the
[50:12] community. you know, you know, I helped
[50:14] this or I helped that. Or you might be
[50:16] on the exact opposite. And you might be
[50:18] sitting there thinking, well, I don't
[50:19] have a good reputation among the
[50:21] community. You know, I I, you know, I I
[50:23] I've been I've been caught for doing
[50:25] this and you know, I I you know, people
[50:27] know me as that or you know, you know,
[50:29] you you just take your pick and fill in
[50:30] the blank of where it's at, you know, or
[50:32] even in yourself. You know, a lot of
[50:34] people fight struggles within themselves
[50:36] because they they know they know what
[50:38] they should be, but yet they don't have
[50:40] the ability to get there. there. And let
[50:42] me tell you something that the only way
[50:43] that you're going to be able to get
[50:45] there is by the word of God. Amen. And
[50:48] Jesus Christ is the only one that'll be
[50:50] able to help you to to be able to get
[50:52] into that place, you know. And so, man
[50:54] has entered a place where where we need
[50:56] uh we we we need identification change.
[51:00] We need something that would that to be
[51:03] able to come into our lives to be able
[51:04] to change us from what we was to what
[51:07] God's word has for us and what he sees
[51:10] us how he sees us today. And so there's
[51:12] a lot of times that we come we come into
[51:14] this we come into the world and we're
[51:16] realizing that hey you know what I you
[51:19] know there's something that's within me
[51:21] that's crying out that tells me you know
[51:23] what I shouldn't be a liar or you know I
[51:26] shouldn't be I shouldn't steal you know
[51:27] or I shouldn't have thoughts like this
[51:29] or or you know I shouldn't be like this
[51:32] way towards my brother or I shouldn't be
[51:33] this way towards my sister. And you
[51:35] know, the only way that I can describe
[51:37] this is is that the fact that you know,
[51:39] a lot of these things that we identify
[51:41] with that there's that there's a status
[51:43] quo or there's a certain there's a
[51:44] certain regiment of rules or there's
[51:47] certain certifications that you got to
[51:48] have in order to be part of the book
[51:50] club or to be part of, you know, the
[51:52] soccer club or to be able to, you know,
[51:54] to be able to uh be part of the football
[51:56] club or to be able to be part of
[51:58] whatever it is that you're trying to
[52:00] identify with. And Christ has the same
[52:02] style as well. And she that yeah, you
[52:04] know that you must you must uh you must
[52:07] repent, be baptized, and you shall
[52:09] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And
[52:11] that's that's the way that God kind of
[52:13] looks at it, you know, and and thinking
[52:15] about this that, you know, we look at
[52:17] life and we realize where we are and we
[52:19] we there's something within us now. A
[52:21] lot of people in life don't have the
[52:23] same desire. You know, there's a there's
[52:25] plenty of seats that are right here in
[52:27] this church and that are not filled
[52:28] people that don't have the same desire,
[52:30] and that's okay. But you have the desire
[52:32] to be right. You have the desire to
[52:35] follow God's word. You have and those
[52:36] this is something that that should be a
[52:39] big old uh barometer to us that God is
[52:41] dealing with your soul or God is dealing
[52:43] with your heart and he's trying to find
[52:45] that avenue to to be able to take full
[52:48] control over your life. And and the
[52:50] thing is is we got to be able to want to
[52:52] be able to die out to our way of
[52:55] thinking and to be able to take on the
[52:57] identification of Christ and be be able
[53:00] to be identify with not only him but his
[53:02] characteristics and the word that he
[53:04] provides and and you know and that is
[53:06] the thing is because when we come into
[53:09] this world and we got our own idea way
[53:11] of thinking every man is right in his
[53:14] own eyes well you know this person did
[53:16] this to me so I'm going to do that to
[53:17] them or you know uh you know but uh I
[53:20] deserve this, so maybe I should be able
[53:22] to do that. Or, you know, a lot of us
[53:24] have our own different ways that we live
[53:26] our life and and and the way that we
[53:28] perceive ourselves, but yet when it
[53:30] comes down to the end of it, without
[53:32] Jesus Christ, nobody's raised from the
[53:34] dead, you know, and nobody's going to be
[53:36] able to take a rapture. And we know that
[53:38] when at the end of the day that when we
[53:40] lay our head down and we go to sleep
[53:42] that uh that we still have something
[53:44] that we need to take care of in our
[53:46] lives. And and that's where Jesus comes
[53:48] in. And that's where his word comes in.
[53:50] And he begins to be able to purge away
[53:52] the different things in our life that
[53:54] are contrary to his word. And and you
[53:56] know what that that when we begin to
[53:58] live our lives, our daytoday lives, you
[54:00] know, this right here that we see coming
[54:02] into this building and singing songs and
[54:05] listening to the preaching, this is only
[54:06] a small percentage of what the the life
[54:09] of Christ actually is. Because the life
[54:12] of Christ isn't just coming up and
[54:14] absorbing religion and walking out and
[54:16] being able to, you know, have a good
[54:18] suit or a good pair of shoes or be able
[54:21] to sing or play instruments, but it's
[54:23] the daytoday life that we live. And it's
[54:25] the day-to-day overcoming that we go
[54:27] through. Doesn't mean that we're going
[54:28] to be doesn't mean that we're going to
[54:30] be perfect in our walk. We should strive
[54:32] to be perfect, but yet but yet there's
[54:34] something that's within us to keep
[54:35] going. And and I look at this uh other
[54:38] scripture here, you know, because Satan,
[54:40] you know, as we begin to change our our
[54:42] our identity, you know, as we begin to
[54:44] come from that person that was, you
[54:46] know, that may have been a drunk or
[54:48] whether we come from that person that
[54:49] might have been a liar or whether we
[54:51] come from that person that might have,
[54:52] you know, just been sitting in church
[54:54] and not absorbing anything but just
[54:56] riding on your your parents' coattails
[54:59] and just being here just because you're
[55:00] told to. But yet there's something
[55:02] that's in that your desire is is to be
[55:05] closer to the L closer to the Lord to be
[55:07] able to experience healing or to be able
[55:10] to experience the power of God. Amen.
[55:13] You must go past your desires. You must
[55:16] go past what you what you think is right
[55:18] and come to the word. Now, now this walk
[55:21] doesn't come easy. You know, now being
[55:23] able, you know, there's a lot of
[55:24] different things. You know, you can
[55:26] identify with a lot of different places
[55:28] and a lot of different things and you
[55:29] might not receive persecution,
[55:34] &gt;&gt; you know, but unless you're in Oklahoma,
[55:36] you know, you're in Oklahoma, you know,
[55:37] there there's the OU fans and then
[55:39] there's the OSU fans, you know, if
[55:41] you're OU fan, you might take a little
[55:43] bit of persecution because you're always
[55:45] on the winning team, you know, and and
[55:48] and and losers don't like winners, you
[55:51] know, and that's just how it is, you
[55:52] know, and and you know, but thinking
[55:54] about this, you know, and I begin to
[55:55] think about how that, you know, when
[55:57] when you say that you want to come to
[55:59] church and you say that you want to
[56:01] change your life and how that you say
[56:03] that, you know, the life that you're
[56:04] living is is just below standard of what
[56:07] God's expectations are for you. You
[56:09] know, this isn't something that's going
[56:11] to come easy. There's not a lot of
[56:12] people that take a whole lot of
[56:14] persecution for being on a football club
[56:16] or a baseball club or a soccer club or
[56:19] being in the book club or being all the
[56:21] but for some reason when you decide to
[56:24] serve the Lord and when you decide to
[56:27] you decide to read God word and make
[56:29] that as your anchor there's a big target
[56:31] that begins to come upon your spiritual
[56:33] foreheads and that's where you know you
[56:36] you begin to become attacked and if you
[56:38] look at a lot of different things that
[56:39] you go through and you become attacked
[56:41] act in your mind whether it's you know
[56:44] financially whether it's by your by your
[56:46] siblings it could be your wife it could
[56:48] be to your husband it could be it could
[56:50] be anybody that you know the devil will
[56:52] use anybody that he can to try to deter
[56:55] you from identifying with Christ now
[56:58] thinking now thinking about you know
[57:00] thinking about that I I I went back and
[57:02] I I looked for a co I looked at a couple
[57:04] scriptures you know we're talking about
[57:06] his name's sake and I I began to kind of
[57:08] type a few of those up and you begin to
[57:10] look there in Luke 20 or 21 12-19 it
[57:13] says but before all these they shall lay
[57:16] their hands on you. Now look how good
[57:19] this is going to be. It says but before
[57:21] all these they shall lay their hands on
[57:23] you and persecute you and and deliver
[57:28] you up to c synagogues and into prisons
[57:31] being brought before kings and rulers
[57:34] for my name's sake.
[57:36] Now
[57:37] &gt;&gt; how many want to how many want to join a
[57:39] club like that? How many want to be
[57:41] identified with something like that that
[57:43] just right off the bat you're going to
[57:44] be persecuted? You're going to be
[57:46] brought before a bunch of people all for
[57:48] my name's sake.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Then you go down in here and it shall
[57:51] turn to you for a testimony. Settle it
[57:54] therefore in your hearts not to uh
[57:56] meditate before what you shall answer.
[57:58] For I will give you a mouth I will give
[58:01] you a mouth and wisdom which all your
[58:03] adversaries shall not be able uh to gang
[58:05] say nor resist. And you shall be bet be
[58:08] bet or you shall be betrayed by both
[58:10] parents
[58:12] and brethren and kinfolks and friends.
[58:17] And some shall say, and some
[58:20] and and some of you shall they cause to
[58:23] be put to death.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; And you shall be hated of all men for my
[58:30] name's sake. Now think about this. Now
[58:33] thinking about this. We're getting past
[58:34] all the roses. We're getting past all
[58:36] the all the all the all the good all the
[58:38] all the good things that are being said.
[58:39] Now we're getting to the to to to the
[58:41] beans and the bullets of the situation.
[58:43] And and it it's for the names sake the
[58:45] one that you claim to want to identify
[58:48] right here right here in this church
[58:50] service that's right here. Amen. This is
[58:52] who I want to identify with. Now, isn't
[58:54] that interesting that there's something
[58:56] Amen. you decide to want to clean your
[58:57] life up or you decide to be able to like
[58:59] you know that you know I want to do
[59:01] something different for the Lord or I or
[59:03] just different for myself and I want to
[59:05] I want to be able to be able to walk
[59:07] those streets of gold and I want to be
[59:08] able to come to the Lord and serve him.
[59:10] But Jesus says that when you come to and
[59:12] when you come to me for my name's sake,
[59:15] you're going to suffer this persecution.
[59:17] There's sometimes identifying with
[59:19] something comes with its costs.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. At sometimes in life,
[59:23] there's sometimes there's some things
[59:25] that you're going to go at. You you
[59:27] can't walk into the you can't walk into
[59:29] the kingdom of God like a freeloader.
[59:31] Amen. You can't walk in because there's
[59:33] going to be a lot of things that are in
[59:34] your life that God's going to chisel
[59:36] off. There's going to be a lot of things
[59:38] that he's got to cut off in order for
[59:40] you to see the reflection of his word in
[59:43] your life. And and identifying with
[59:45] Christ, you're saying, "Well, brother
[59:47] Michael, I can't see him. I can't feel
[59:49] him. I I you know I can't touch him. If
[59:52] you stop looking at God carnally minded
[59:54] and you look at him through the fruits
[59:56] of the spirit, God's word has been God's
[59:59] word is his characteristics and that is
[1:00:02] proof enough for God's identification in
[1:00:06] this hour that we live in. Amen. To say
[1:00:08] that he's living and breathing amongst
[1:00:10] human pe amongst us to get again. Now,
[1:00:14] thinking about this, he says, and we're
[1:00:16] going to go on down. And he says, "And
[1:00:17] there shall not be uh and you shall be
[1:00:19] hated of all men for my name's sakes,
[1:00:21] but there shall there shall not a hair
[1:00:23] of your head perish, and your patience
[1:00:26] possess ye your souls." Now, going there
[1:00:28] to Acts 19:13 and 16. Now, this is
[1:00:31] dealing with this is dealing with Paul.
[1:00:34] Now, dealing with Paul here. And Ananas
[1:00:37] says,"Lord, I have heard by many of
[1:00:39] these or many of this man how much evil
[1:00:41] he had done to the saints at Jerusalem."
[1:00:44] And here he hath the authority from the
[1:00:46] chief priests to bind all that call on
[1:00:49] his name. But the Lord said unto him,
[1:00:51] "Go thy way, for he has a for he is a
[1:00:53] chosen vessel unto me to bear my name
[1:00:56] before the Gentiles and kings and the
[1:00:59] children of Israel. For I will show him
[1:01:02] how great things he must suffer for my
[1:01:06] name's sake.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; You must suffer. Sometimes identifying
[1:01:11] with Christ means you suffer. Whether
[1:01:14] it's at the hands whether it's at the
[1:01:16] hands of your family, whether it's at
[1:01:18] the hands of your friends, whether it's
[1:01:20] whether it's a it might be a co-orker,
[1:01:22] it might be a boss, it might be
[1:01:23] something. Amen. someone that you're
[1:01:25] close to that when you begin to identify
[1:01:27] with Christ that all of a sudden these
[1:01:30] things begin to begin to come as
[1:01:32] opposition to you and your life. Now,
[1:01:35] the only way to overcome opposition and
[1:01:37] the only way for us to be able to
[1:01:39] overcome Satan that's pressing against
[1:01:41] our life because that's our number one
[1:01:43] adversary. Amen. That's the one that has
[1:01:45] hated God's plan since the very
[1:01:48] beginning. That that he was going to put
[1:01:50] himself in the flesh that he himself had
[1:01:54] tripped up at the beginning. Amen. His
[1:01:56] his desire is to keep you from the will
[1:02:00] of God. Keep you from identifying
[1:02:02] yourself in the scriptures. Amen. Making
[1:02:05] the word to live. He hated it when Jesus
[1:02:08] was there because everything that the
[1:02:10] prophets had spoke of in old time was
[1:02:12] being manifested right there when Jesus
[1:02:15] was alive. Amen. As we know that in the
[1:02:17] scriptures where it talked about at the
[1:02:19] point of his death that hundreds of
[1:02:21] scriptures were being fulfilled. So
[1:02:23] again, we have the same problem that we
[1:02:25] have today for Satan is the fact that he
[1:02:28] doesn't want this word becoming flesh.
[1:02:31] He doesn't want amen that he doesn't
[1:02:33] want the power, the spirit, the the the
[1:02:36] real anointing coming down, amen, in our
[1:02:39] services. He don't want it coming down
[1:02:40] in our community, his desire is to be
[1:02:43] able to stop the work of God right dead
[1:02:46] in its tracks. So, in order to be able
[1:02:49] for in order for us to be able to come
[1:02:51] and to be able to to step into the plan
[1:02:54] of God, first there's there's only one
[1:02:56] way to do it. Yeah. There's only there's
[1:02:58] only one way to be able to step into the
[1:03:00] plan of God, and that's to be able to
[1:03:02] come under the word that he's provided
[1:03:04] for our day.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And that's where you begin and that's
[1:03:08] where you begin to find God. There's a
[1:03:09] lot of there's a lot of uh if you want
[1:03:11] to look at it, we're going back to
[1:03:12] identification. There's a lot of there's
[1:03:14] a lot of uh uh uh uh uh there's I'm I'm
[1:03:17] looking for the word. There's a lot of
[1:03:18] people that try to pretend or try to
[1:03:21] steal an identity. Now, we live in an we
[1:03:23] live in an era. We live in a time of
[1:03:25] life where where identities are being
[1:03:27] stolen left and right. You know, I you
[1:03:29] know, not that I like it, but I mean
[1:03:31] when I when I see some of you guys, you
[1:03:33] put on the WhatsApp and they're like,
[1:03:34] "Oh, I've been hacked." You know, you
[1:03:36] know, we're getting if you're getting uh
[1:03:38] invitations from me, don't let it
[1:03:39] happen. It's because somebody has
[1:03:41] pretended to be who you are and they
[1:03:44] have and they have tried to get into
[1:03:45] your personal information. Amen. And
[1:03:48] Satan has tried to interpret to you who
[1:03:51] you are. And he's tried to interpret to
[1:03:54] you, amen, who you are. He says that no,
[1:03:56] he said there's no way that you're going
[1:03:58] to be able to overcome, amen, lust in
[1:04:01] your life because your dad's dealt with
[1:04:02] it. Your grandpa's dealt with it. And
[1:04:04] this is something that you're going to
[1:04:06] have to try to live with. He wants you
[1:04:08] to be he wants you to to to try and
[1:04:11] modify yourself to an identity that is
[1:04:14] non-existent, that God has not planned
[1:04:17] for you in your life. God has not
[1:04:18] planned for you to live subpar as a
[1:04:21] subpar Christian. Amen. In this life
[1:04:24] that we live in. But what God's idea is
[1:04:26] is for you to be an overcomer. And God
[1:04:29] doesn't or Satan's desire is to keep you
[1:04:32] below your standards. You what you got
[1:04:34] to remember is that he doesn't want you
[1:04:36] to succeed. But the only way that you're
[1:04:38] going to be able to overcome the devil
[1:04:40] is not by psychology. You're not going
[1:04:42] to be able to stand back and be able,
[1:04:44] you know what? if I if I'm just good for
[1:04:45] so many weeks, you know, I don't do
[1:04:47] this, I don't do that, I don't do this,
[1:04:49] I'm going to overcome that that or or
[1:04:51] you know, oh, I better be good to this
[1:04:54] brother right here because I really
[1:04:55] struggle with bitterness, you know, and
[1:04:57] and and this brother, he really makes me
[1:04:58] mad all the time, but if I put on a fake
[1:05:00] smile and I walk over and I shake his
[1:05:02] hand, you know, that's going to be
[1:05:04] pleasing to God. or or you know what,
[1:05:07] you know, I as long as I don't steal or
[1:05:09] or you know, if I steal or or if I cheat
[1:05:12] or if I do this or I do that, any way
[1:05:14] that you might be able to try to
[1:05:15] fashion, Amen. your form of religion
[1:05:18] that's acceptable to God, Amen. God says
[1:05:21] that these things stink and these things
[1:05:23] are is not is not these not is not
[1:05:25] acceptable. But the only way that you're
[1:05:27] going to be able to be sweet and the
[1:05:28] only way that you're going to be able to
[1:05:30] come before God in purity and
[1:05:32] righteousness is by his word. Amen. And
[1:05:35] the way that you identify Christ is by
[1:05:38] the word. And so when I'm thinking about
[1:05:40] these things, what is it that you need
[1:05:42] to be able to overcome the enemy? to be
[1:05:45] able to shake off the identification of
[1:05:47] of who I was and what I have what I what
[1:05:50] the the reputation that I have created
[1:05:52] of the past and what is it and the way
[1:05:54] to be able to to be able to shake that
[1:05:57] off and to be able to try and and or to
[1:06:00] be able to move on victoriously with
[1:06:03] Christ it is to be able to take on the
[1:06:05] identification of God's word now think
[1:06:08] about this now there's so much phony
[1:06:10] that's taking place and we're going to
[1:06:12] move we'll move back just to that for a
[1:06:14] But but there's so much phony and
[1:06:16] there's so much that's taking place here
[1:06:18] in the world today. Now now we can look
[1:06:20] at this and and we can realize we can
[1:06:23] realize okay you know what I'm not the
[1:06:26] person I desire to be Lord. And I you
[1:06:29] know what? I see a lot of things that
[1:06:30] are h that has happened in my life and a
[1:06:32] lot of things that are going on in my
[1:06:34] life and and and I see where where my
[1:06:36] mistakes are, Lord. And I and I and I
[1:06:38] really would love to overcome these
[1:06:40] things. And I would love for you, Lord,
[1:06:42] to be able to come into my life and amen
[1:06:44] and change my habits and change my ways
[1:06:46] and amen take away the desires of sin in
[1:06:49] my life. and and you know I God I I
[1:06:52] desire to be identified with you and and
[1:06:54] and I I I don't like I don't like it
[1:06:57] when they walk down the street and and I
[1:06:59] have to hang my head low because you
[1:07:01] know what I'm guilty for these things
[1:07:03] that I've done. I'm guilty for
[1:07:04] everything that I done. And you know
[1:07:06] what? We're all guilty of things that
[1:07:08] we've not done. Every one of us, it
[1:07:10] doesn't matter if you're outside the
[1:07:11] church this this evening or if you're
[1:07:13] inside the church. There's things that
[1:07:15] amen that we fall short daily on. Amen.
[1:07:17] In service to the Lord. Amen. things
[1:07:19] that would that we now we don't leave
[1:07:21] those things hang in condemnation but
[1:07:23] yet we step on it as conviction of Lord
[1:07:26] help me be more like you let my desires
[1:07:28] to be more like you and then all of a
[1:07:30] sudden you know that Satan he comes and
[1:07:33] he tries to impersonate religion to us
[1:07:36] and he comes out and he says you know
[1:07:37] what maybe just raise your hands a
[1:07:39] little bit or you know or maybe if maybe
[1:07:42] if you just sing a song or you know or
[1:07:44] or maybe you could just think of some
[1:07:46] scriptures or or all of a sudden he he
[1:07:48] tries to he tries to uh cover you amen
[1:07:51] with just a form of church and makes you
[1:07:54] making things okay to where Amen you
[1:07:56] know as long as I just come to church on
[1:07:58] Sunday Sunday night or Wednesday you
[1:08:00] know God's going to say that's okay know
[1:08:02] that you know you know as long as you
[1:08:04] know I dress right and I don't cuss and
[1:08:07] I don't do this and I don't do that you
[1:08:09] know maybe maybe that that that'll be
[1:08:11] okay that'll be acceptable that that
[1:08:14] acceptable unto the Lord but you know
[1:08:15] what God's not looking for a white
[1:08:18] shepherd replic God's not looking for
[1:08:20] God's not looking for something of that
[1:08:22] like that but he's looking for something
[1:08:24] that's spiritfilled and it follows the
[1:08:26] word of God and and I begin to think
[1:08:28] about how that you know that how there
[1:08:31] is an example and what I love about the
[1:08:33] Bible and I would I you know I I echo
[1:08:35] brother Windle's uh advice when he says
[1:08:37] to you know read your Bible you really
[1:08:40] really ought to read your Bible and let
[1:08:42] God you know some let God be able to
[1:08:44] kind of bring these things up during the
[1:08:45] services you know vindicate that's how
[1:08:47] he vindicates his word, you know, is is
[1:08:49] with the by is by uh the Bible and he
[1:08:51] vindicates his word and and you know and
[1:08:53] begin to think about how that even in
[1:08:55] the Bible, you know, it talks about how
[1:08:57] that there was Moab and how that there
[1:08:58] was Israel and about how that you know
[1:09:01] but you know I I I was interesting how
[1:09:03] brother Brandham he goes and he talks
[1:09:05] about this and and he says that you he
[1:09:07] talks about he goes now Moab was not no
[1:09:09] heathen nation by any means. He said by
[1:09:11] any means. He's like and he he said uh
[1:09:13] he said that you know that that when it
[1:09:15] come to when it come to a service and it
[1:09:18] come to a church you know they had seven
[1:09:20] altars just like Israel had seven altars
[1:09:22] you know and he said when it come to the
[1:09:24] rams you know or having the having the
[1:09:27] sacrifice they had the sacrifices as
[1:09:29] well and when it come to a prophet they
[1:09:31] had a prophet and Israel had a prophet
[1:09:33] you know and I began to think about this
[1:09:35] and I was just you know and that's where
[1:09:37] the world stands a lot today is that you
[1:09:39] know they look at religion and you know
[1:09:41] You could sit right here in a message
[1:09:43] church and you can look out the window
[1:09:44] and you could say, you know what, well
[1:09:46] these people uh you know they have they
[1:09:48] have a youth meetings or they have this
[1:09:51] and activities and you know they look
[1:09:53] out and and they say you know what well
[1:09:54] the over there they have the lights and
[1:09:56] they have the best of music and and you
[1:09:59] know out here every Wednesday you know
[1:10:00] instead of putting the young people you
[1:10:02] know all together inside the church to
[1:10:04] be able to listen to the church they
[1:10:05] have activities that go on out there and
[1:10:07] and they still speak some scriptures and
[1:10:09] they sp so what is it that that keeps
[1:10:12] the two that are separating now. We're
[1:10:14] talking about identification here. We're
[1:10:16] talking about Amen. separating yourself,
[1:10:18] amen, from the identification of who you
[1:10:21] are and accepting the identification of
[1:10:24] who he is. Now, thinking about this, I I
[1:10:27] go back and I look into the into the
[1:10:28] scriptures here because if you think
[1:10:30] about Moab and you think about Israel
[1:10:32] and the two both of them have prophets
[1:10:34] and Balum uh Balum had prophecies that
[1:10:38] were that had been that had been
[1:10:39] fulfilled even in scripture. So, you're
[1:10:41] sitting there and you're looking at
[1:10:42] what's the difference of this here. So,
[1:10:44] I begin to do a little bit of uh combing
[1:10:46] through and it says here uh in the
[1:10:49] message God identify him identifying
[1:10:51] himself by the characteristics. But you
[1:10:54] see Moses being the correct prophet of
[1:10:56] God not only had the fundamental parts.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Now the fundamental parts is what he's
[1:11:01] talking about the altars and the
[1:11:03] sacrifices and he's talking about this.
[1:11:05] Oh, not only the fundamental parts but
[1:11:07] he had the identification of God. See he
[1:11:10] was in the line of duty exactly what he
[1:11:13] was promised for that age. Not for the
[1:11:16] age of Noah but for the age of them. Now
[1:11:19] listen to this. Okay. So I will take you
[1:11:22] to the land that's flowing with milk and
[1:11:24] honey. There they were on their way and
[1:11:26] Israel was identified with the prophet
[1:11:29] Moses with the message of that age.
[1:11:31] God's characteristics identified in
[1:11:34] Moses. A pillar of fire was following
[1:11:37] him. He also had the anoint the
[1:11:40] anointment.
[1:11:42] Oh, sorry. My spit was in the way. He or
[1:11:45] he also had the atonement in action.
[1:11:48] Now, I want you to think of this. I want
[1:11:50] you to put your your your thinking caps
[1:11:52] on. And I want you to think about what
[1:11:55] he's talking about when he's identifying
[1:11:58] what is it that's making him what it is.
[1:12:01] What is it that's identifying Moses?
[1:12:03] Okay. He says, he says that the pillar
[1:12:05] of fire was following them. Also, the
[1:12:08] atonement was in action. Not speaking of
[1:12:11] it, but had it in action. He says, not
[1:12:14] what will be, but what is right now. So
[1:12:17] he's talking about present present
[1:12:19] tense. He's talking about all these
[1:12:20] things that are happening in present
[1:12:22] tense. He says notice he had the brass
[1:12:24] serpent that had been lifted up for the
[1:12:26] sicknesses and disease of the people.
[1:12:29] Therefore Moses was practicing divine
[1:12:31] healing. Okay, think about that. He was
[1:12:34] at that current time practicing divine
[1:12:37] healing. Okay. So now he says he had the
[1:12:41] atonement, the brass serpent symbolizing
[1:12:44] that God was in the camp. Okay. And and
[1:12:47] the people were looking on that brass
[1:12:50] serpent and being healed. He also had
[1:12:52] the smitten rock following him. And that
[1:12:54] was identifying God to keep the waters
[1:12:57] of life among them, joy and salvation.
[1:13:01] And they were not perished but have
[1:13:03] everlasting life. It was a type that the
[1:13:05] smitten rock was in the was or the
[1:13:08] smitten rock in the wilderness was a
[1:13:10] type of Christ being smitten. Then they
[1:13:12] were traveling. Look, now look at these
[1:13:14] characteristics. I love how he points
[1:13:16] these things out because if you're
[1:13:18] thinking about it, you can parallel a
[1:13:20] lot of this to today. Okay? He says,
[1:13:22] "Then they were traveling in the line of
[1:13:25] promise."
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; What was their promise? Is that they
[1:13:28] were going to a land.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. that their promise was is that
[1:13:32] Moses was taking them into a land. Okay,
[1:13:35] so now we're we're speaking of we're
[1:13:36] trying to cut out the black and white.
[1:13:38] Okay, we're trying to cut out the the
[1:13:40] fake dollar and the silver dollar. So
[1:13:42] right now we're cutting out false
[1:13:44] religion and current religion that we
[1:13:46] can identify for today. And they were
[1:13:48] traveling in the line of promise that
[1:13:50] was another identification to showing
[1:13:53] God's characteristics. No matter how
[1:13:55] fundamental this other one was with the
[1:13:57] word, he had the fund fundamentalism
[1:14:01] plus the identification and the
[1:14:03] characteristics of God among them. God
[1:14:07] identified himself two prophets, both of
[1:14:10] them prophets,
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; and both of them fundamentalists. He
[1:14:16] says, "But God identified him identified
[1:14:19] his characteristics in Moses because he
[1:14:22] had the characteristics of God in him."
[1:14:26] Amen. So that's what it is is the God
[1:14:28] you identifying yourself with current
[1:14:32] scripture for today. Current mana for
[1:14:34] today. And that's what you go to is you
[1:14:36] go to God's word. We don't want to
[1:14:38] identify. We don't want to sit here and
[1:14:40] identify ourselves with with the things
[1:14:43] of the past. And we don't want to
[1:14:44] identify ourselves with problems that we
[1:14:47] might have in the future. But yet we
[1:14:49] don't want to even identify oursel with
[1:14:51] our current circumstance. Whether we're
[1:14:53] sick in our body, whether we're we're po
[1:14:55] whether we whether we're all broke. You
[1:14:57] know what I'm saying? I mean I mean I
[1:14:59] mean whether we identify ourselves in
[1:15:01] finances or whether we identify
[1:15:03] ourselves as not having this or not
[1:15:05] having that. But you identify yourselves
[1:15:08] in the current promise for promises of
[1:15:11] today. Amen. And that is you will take a
[1:15:13] rapture. You are a child of God. You are
[1:15:17] going to overcome the enemy in your
[1:15:19] life. Amen. You just got to be able to
[1:15:21] set yourself, Amen. Set yourself with
[1:15:24] the identity of God. Amen. Don't sit
[1:15:26] there and live your life in a place,
[1:15:28] amen, that you can't look up and say,
[1:15:30] "God, amen, I want to be more like you."
[1:15:33] It's at that very moment that Satan's
[1:15:35] going to fight you in your life. It's at
[1:15:37] that very moment that he's going to come
[1:15:39] and he's going to try and take
[1:15:40] everything from you because he doesn't
[1:15:42] want word made flesh here today.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want it. Amen. Satan doesn't
[1:15:47] want the word being manifest here today.
[1:15:50] But you know what? Amen. We can identify
[1:15:53] ourselves with the scripture. Amen. Be
[1:15:55] able to say that you know what? We are
[1:15:57] part of him. Amen. We are the sons and
[1:15:59] daughters of God and we can overcome
[1:16:01] these things. Amen. Because we're being
[1:16:04] identified in him.
[1:16:06] But a lot of times
[1:16:10] God when he identifies himself, it's
[1:16:13] always through the word.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; That's God's footprint. That's God's
[1:16:19] footprint. That's how God does this. Now
[1:16:21] look,
[1:16:22] we look back, we look back into this,
[1:16:25] look back in in some of these scriptures
[1:16:27] here. He says John 5 and 38:40.
[1:16:30] Remember, he's going back and forth.
[1:16:31] John 538 and 40. He's going back and
[1:16:34] forth with the Sadducees and the the
[1:16:36] Pharisees. He's going back and forth
[1:16:38] amongst all these religious people. And
[1:16:40] he says, "And he and and ye have not his
[1:16:43] word abiding in you, for whom he hath
[1:16:46] sent him, ye believe not." Now think
[1:16:50] about this. At the very portion of the
[1:16:53] scripture, he says, "And ye have not the
[1:16:54] word abiding in you."
[1:16:58] Okay? So that that that plays a key
[1:17:01] element. The word abiding in you.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Not just your pastor preaching it.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just your youth leader telling
[1:17:08] you that it's a good idea, but you
[1:17:10] yourself are abiding in the word.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; You yourself are reading the scriptures
[1:17:16] for yourself.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; You yourself are listening for the
[1:17:19] messages or yourself. Not because you're
[1:17:21] being told to.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody wants that kind of
[1:17:23] individual. Amen. always having to kind
[1:17:25] of tell them, you know, that you better
[1:17:26] do this, you better do that, you better
[1:17:28] do this, you better do that. God doesn't
[1:17:30] want that kind of a person. He wants
[1:17:31] somebody with a desire,
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; somebody with a desire within them to
[1:17:36] realize that I don't have what it takes
[1:17:38] to be the man that God requires me to
[1:17:41] be. So, I want to identify myself with
[1:17:44] him.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "And ye have not the
[1:17:49] word abiding in you." Abiding is living,
[1:17:51] its habitation, its place. He says, "For
[1:17:54] whom he hath sent him ye believe not."
[1:17:58] Now look at this. There's a lot of
[1:18:00] different places that he could have went
[1:18:02] because you're talking about God of
[1:18:03] heaven. He's But he goes back so he can
[1:18:08] he can go and he can bring the two
[1:18:10] together with his followers.
[1:18:13] Search the scriptures.
[1:18:16] He says the very scriptures that they're
[1:18:19] claiming to read, the very scriptures
[1:18:21] that they're saying, "Oh, that they're
[1:18:22] looking for this Messiah. They're
[1:18:23] looking for this coming. They're looking
[1:18:25] for this one. They're looking, they're
[1:18:26] looking, they're looking." And all of a
[1:18:27] sudden, he appears and and they're like,
[1:18:29] "Who are you?"
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And and Jesus is standing back and he's
[1:18:33] like, "Search the scriptures."
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; He says, "Search the scriptures for in
[1:18:37] them you think you have eternal life."
[1:18:40] Now, there's where the letter kleth and
[1:18:43] the spirit brings life. They sat there
[1:18:45] and read the scripture. Read the
[1:18:47] scripture. Read the scripture. But the
[1:18:48] very manifested one that when he came,
[1:18:51] they missed him.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Search the scriptures. For in them you
[1:18:56] think that you have eternal life. And
[1:18:58] they are they which testify
[1:19:01] of me.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; And ye will not come to me that ye may
[1:19:06] have life.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; He won't come to him. But yet it's the
[1:19:10] one that they've been looking for. is
[1:19:12] the one that they but yet when he stands
[1:19:13] right in front of them, amen, they don't
[1:19:15] even see who he is. Amen. Because he
[1:19:18] came unusual.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; He came in a way that he didn't realize.
[1:19:22] He didn't realize, oh, they were looking
[1:19:24] for an overcomer. They were looking for
[1:19:25] this king. They were looking for this,
[1:19:27] this, this. And God can care less what
[1:19:29] was happening on earth.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; He was wanting to make sure. Now, first
[1:19:33] thing he said, because the word is not
[1:19:35] in you,
[1:19:37] think about this.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Because the word is not in you. There's
[1:19:40] a lot of people that the word is not in.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that doesn't
[1:19:44] matter what the word says.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; It doesn't prick their heart.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; It doesn't come into consciousness when
[1:19:50] they make decisions. The word doesn't
[1:19:51] come into play when they when they're
[1:19:53] met up at a tea in the road and all of a
[1:19:55] sudden then they could go left when they
[1:19:57] need to go right. A amen. But yet
[1:19:59] they're thinking, "Well, nobody's
[1:20:00] around." But when the word comes, it
[1:20:02] corrects them. Yeah.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, but what there is
[1:20:06] is there's something a responder that
[1:20:07] can come and it can contact back and
[1:20:09] forth
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; is because they have an identification.
[1:20:12] Let me tell you something. You're not
[1:20:14] fighting to you're not you're not
[1:20:17] fighting to become a son of God. You are
[1:20:20] a son of God.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; You are a son of God. Amen. You're
[1:20:23] fighting the wicked one that's keeping
[1:20:25] you from from realizing, Amen. your
[1:20:28] potential that your identification is
[1:20:30] not a mere human. Amen. But you have the
[1:20:33] ability to change the atmosphere that's
[1:20:36] around you. Amen. That you have the
[1:20:38] ability by the spoken word. Amen. To
[1:20:40] walk into a midst of a situation and to
[1:20:43] be able to say and to be able to come
[1:20:45] and take the spirits under control.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Why do you think when you know I I love
[1:20:51] it when Jesus was out there and he was
[1:20:52] crossing the he was crossing the the the
[1:20:54] I keep calling it the ocean, but it
[1:20:56] wasn't the ocean. You know, he's he's
[1:20:58] crossing the Red Sea.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Sea of Galilee.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; The Sea of Galilee. That's right. He's
[1:21:01] crossing the Sea of Galilee and he goes
[1:21:03] out there and he stands over the boat
[1:21:04] and he's like, "Peace, be still."
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; And the winds and the waves obey him and
[1:21:08] everybody's like, "Whoa, what manner of
[1:21:10] man is this?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; What manner of man is this?"
[1:21:14] What is it about an individual that can
[1:21:16] walk into a situation and speak peace to
[1:21:19] the situation? Whether you're a father,
[1:21:21] whether you're a mother, amen, whether
[1:21:23] you're a grandpa or grandma or or
[1:21:25] somebody that's well trained in the word
[1:21:27] because the word abides in you and you
[1:21:30] can identify with that word and that
[1:21:32] word identifies back with you. You could
[1:21:34] take control over the situation that
[1:21:36] you're in.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; It's because it's not you Satan's coming
[1:21:39] up against, but he's coming up against
[1:21:40] the word that is abiding within you.
[1:21:43] Yeah,
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; that's what God that was whole God's his
[1:21:46] whole desire was to be able to to
[1:21:49] identify himself with flesh again that
[1:21:51] when people see you, they see Christ.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; You know, going back when they're
[1:21:59] talking about my name, my name's sake,
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; you go there in Acts 4:10 and 14.
[1:22:06] Now, in order to be identified with
[1:22:10] Christ, you must be bold.
[1:22:14] You must be bold. And I'm I'm not
[1:22:15] talking about the world's style of bold,
[1:22:18] but you must be bold within yourself.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Because there's decisions that you make
[1:22:23] that you only make. There's decisions
[1:22:26] sometimes that you're in the world that
[1:22:28] you have to make that God puts you in.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; So that you can show the characteristics
[1:22:33] of God to this age that we live in. How
[1:22:36] many of you that have ever been in here
[1:22:38] have been in a situation and knew knew
[1:22:42] the decision that you made? If somebody
[1:22:44] else would have made a decision, it
[1:22:46] would have been the wrong decision.
[1:22:47] Whether it was something that was done
[1:22:48] in secret or whether it had to deal with
[1:22:50] money or whether it had to deal with
[1:22:52] amen speaking lies or doing something
[1:22:55] against somebody or doing something, but
[1:22:56] yet it was not your decision because by
[1:22:59] nature, Amen. But you take it back to
[1:23:01] the word and you're like, "No, I'm not a
[1:23:03] liar." You know, no, I'm not a thief.
[1:23:05] No, I'm not. No, I'm not. What you do is
[1:23:08] you're lining those charact your own
[1:23:09] characteristics up with the
[1:23:11] characteristics of God. Okay, people
[1:23:13] notice those things. If you go back and
[1:23:15] you look at Peter there in Acts 4:10, it
[1:23:18] says, "Be it known unto you all and to
[1:23:20] all the people of Israel that by the
[1:23:23] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom
[1:23:25] you crucified, whom God raised from the
[1:23:27] dead, even by him doth this man stand
[1:23:30] here before you whole." Now, a miracle
[1:23:33] had just taken place.
[1:23:36] This is the stone which was set at not
[1:23:38] of you builders, which ye become the
[1:23:41] head of the corner. Neither is the
[1:23:43] salvation any in any other, for there is
[1:23:46] none other name under the heavens given
[1:23:48] among men, whereby you must be saved.
[1:23:51] Now when you saw the boldness of Peter
[1:23:53] and John, now when they saw the boldness
[1:23:55] of Peter and John and perceived that
[1:23:58] they were unlearned and ignorant men
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; now by their speech they're unlearned
[1:24:06] and they're ignorant.
[1:24:08] Okay? Both. Both of them.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; He says they marveled and they took
[1:24:16] knowledge of them that they had been
[1:24:19] with Jesus. Glory to God.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Now, think about that. Jesus hadn't even
[1:24:22] stepped on the scene yet or had wasn't
[1:24:24] even on the scene, but they could tell
[1:24:26] by the characteristics that were inside
[1:24:29] of the disciples that they had
[1:24:31] identified with Jesus Christ. They had
[1:24:33] put all their life aside and they had
[1:24:36] taken on the characteristics, the
[1:24:38] identification of Jesus. So when the
[1:24:40] time had come, amen, for a man to stand
[1:24:43] up and the word to be exhibited in front
[1:24:46] of a group of people, amen, he could
[1:24:48] stand up with the same speech. Remember,
[1:24:50] he said, "Don't give word to what you
[1:24:52] should speak or what you know what these
[1:24:54] things that he'd say, but he he'd say it
[1:24:56] because the word is the one that was is
[1:24:58] going to be the one that says it." And
[1:25:00] so Peter or Yeah. Yeah. Peter stands up.
[1:25:02] Amen. And he had did the exact same
[1:25:05] thing Jesus had done. And the people saw
[1:25:08] Jesus in Peter. Amen. And it's the exact
[1:25:11] same way that we come that that when
[1:25:14] that God comes here this evening is that
[1:25:16] the fact that we can open ourselves up
[1:25:19] and we can align ourselves not with our
[1:25:22] own ideas, not with our not with our own
[1:25:25] uh uh preconceived uh thinking of how
[1:25:27] things should be. But yet God can bring
[1:25:29] and he can he can bring us together and
[1:25:32] we can solely identify and we can
[1:25:35] exhibit Christ. Amen. by the manifested
[1:25:37] word that we live here here through the
[1:25:40] message of the hour. Now, think of it.
[1:25:42] There's a lot of false religion that's
[1:25:44] in the world. There's a lot of there's a
[1:25:45] lot of what he said or she said, but yet
[1:25:47] we have a vindicated message. Amen. We
[1:25:50] have a prophet that come not with just
[1:25:51] the fundamentals. He didn't come and he
[1:25:54] was just like, "Oh, you know, we need to
[1:25:55] have our all men's right and we need to
[1:25:57] have this and we need to have that." But
[1:25:59] yet his one of the focuses was the
[1:26:02] spirit and that was behind the life.
[1:26:05] Amen. exhibiting the word for today.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him here this evening.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; The unusualness of God.
[1:26:21] God will come in not your expected way.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; You know here in time we always ex we
[1:26:28] expect to God for God to do things
[1:26:31] immediately. We expect God to do things
[1:26:34] in a way that we can understand him. You
[1:26:37] know, like Lord, if you're going to do
[1:26:38] something, it needs to be like this or
[1:26:40] it needs to be like that or you know
[1:26:41] what, it needs to be uh it needs to be
[1:26:44] in a way that I can see. But yet, he
[1:26:45] does things unusually. If you look at
[1:26:47] the birth of Christ, we just stand back
[1:26:49] and we look at the birth of Christ. And
[1:26:51] even the fact that the scriptures had
[1:26:54] already prophesied these things hundreds
[1:26:56] of years before Christ had ever come. I
[1:26:58] I go back and look God identify God
[1:27:01] identifying himself by his
[1:27:03] characteristics. I pulled a lot of this
[1:27:05] stuff from there, but it says, "But
[1:27:06] Joseph looking into her big pretty eyes
[1:27:11] and she would say, Joseph," of course,
[1:27:14] we're speaking of Mary. And if you go
[1:27:15] back up above this to kind of give a
[1:27:17] little note of it, brother Random goes
[1:27:19] off and he says that, you know, Mary was
[1:27:22] at a point of her life where she it
[1:27:24] looked as if she was hiding behind Moses
[1:27:26] or hiding behind Joseph. It looked as if
[1:27:29] she was hiding behind Joseph because she
[1:27:33] knew what she she had a you know she had
[1:27:35] this child and she was trying to you
[1:27:37] know get married and you know because we
[1:27:39] all know what happens
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; you know in that time or that age that
[1:27:42] they go out and stone her you know that
[1:27:44] they go out so it appears going into the
[1:27:47] story it appears as if as if Mary's
[1:27:50] walking into the situation with the
[1:27:51] hidden motive says but he says but
[1:27:54] Joseph looking in her pretty eyes and
[1:27:56] she would say Joseph Gabriel said to me,
[1:27:59] "The Holy Spirit shall overshadow thee,
[1:28:03] and this thing, this thing that will be
[1:28:05] conceived in thee, in thee is of the
[1:28:08] Holy Spirit. It's God. It's what's going
[1:28:11] to be called the Son of God." And
[1:28:14] Joseph,
[1:28:15] he he wanted to believe that, but it was
[1:28:18] so unusual.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; That that never happened before.
[1:28:25] And that's now this is the part where he
[1:28:27] gets he says and that's just the way
[1:28:29] today if we could only if we have some
[1:28:32] way of getting it to the people to see
[1:28:34] the unusualness of anything if it's
[1:28:38] identified by the word then its
[1:28:41] characteristics prove what it is it's
[1:28:44] God in action he says Joseph should have
[1:28:48] known
[1:28:50] think about this a lot of things that we
[1:28:52] go through in our life. A lot of times
[1:28:54] in the the thing a lot of the lot of p
[1:28:56] the the paths that a lot of us take, we
[1:29:00] should have known. We should have known,
[1:29:03] hey man, by the things that we're going
[1:29:04] through that God's working in our favor
[1:29:07] that he's in action. He says he says God
[1:29:10] or Joseph should have known that he or
[1:29:13] he should have known a virgin shall
[1:29:16] conceive. But he was honest about it. He
[1:29:18] didn't want to put her away privately.
[1:29:20] He was going to do so priv privately. He
[1:29:23] was thinking about doing it. But yet it
[1:29:25] comes so unusual. And the word sometimes
[1:29:28] it comes so unusual to us. Like you're
[1:29:31] in the middle of a situation in your
[1:29:33] life. you you about to get your lights
[1:29:34] turned off and and you've been working
[1:29:36] hard and and you're wondering what
[1:29:38] you're going to do and all of a sudden
[1:29:39] you get to the bottom of the barrel and
[1:29:41] and and you reach out and you step in
[1:29:44] and you identify not with the current
[1:29:46] circumstance of where you're at, but you
[1:29:49] identify with God's promises and God
[1:29:51] brings it to pass. It's the same way
[1:29:53] with healing. You can identify with the
[1:29:55] infirmity that's going on in your body
[1:29:58] or you can stand back and you can
[1:30:00] identify with by my stripes you are
[1:30:02] healed. Amen. And we know that we know
[1:30:05] we can identify that that scripture is
[1:30:08] alive and remaining because we have a
[1:30:10] prophet now. There's a lot of prophets
[1:30:12] that that are in the land today.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; We know that there's a lot of prophets
[1:30:16] that are in the land today and they have
[1:30:18] the fundamentals. They have the
[1:30:20] fundamentals and they could even go on
[1:30:21] to say that they have the moving of the
[1:30:23] spirit. But does their but does their
[1:30:26] life their characteristics line up with
[1:30:28] the word? Amen. That is being projected
[1:30:31] to us today because we're not in a we're
[1:30:33] not in a we're not in a Baptist gospel.
[1:30:36] We're not in a Methodist gospel. We're
[1:30:38] not in a time of times past. We're not
[1:30:40] in the shadows. But right now, we are we
[1:30:43] are at the positive. You know, we we we
[1:30:45] are at the positive of the picture and
[1:30:47] what God is God is expecting us to see a
[1:30:50] reflection for himself like that gold.
[1:30:53] Amen. That's been tried in the fire. And
[1:30:55] sometimes life throws unusual
[1:30:58] circumstances in our way. Amen. But yet
[1:31:00] you've not put on the you don't have the
[1:31:03] flesh of yourself to sit back and just
[1:31:06] get mad at the circumstance and get mad
[1:31:08] at God or get mad at this person or get
[1:31:10] mad at that person. But yet God's given
[1:31:13] you a way to overcome. And that's the
[1:31:15] identifying with the word. Amen. Right
[1:31:18] now for your day and your hour and watch
[1:31:21] God move. Now that's something that
[1:31:23] Satan can't get a hold of. That's
[1:31:25] something that Satan he's going to try
[1:31:27] to come at your life. You might be
[1:31:29] sitting at your home and having a bad
[1:31:31] day and he's putting bad thoughts in
[1:31:33] your mind about a brother or a sister or
[1:31:35] he's putting your or he's putting
[1:31:37] thoughts in your mind about the church
[1:31:39] or he's doing these different things.
[1:31:40] But you bring it right up and you line
[1:31:42] it right back up with the word of today
[1:31:44] and you and you bring it across a
[1:31:46] vindicated message for the hour and you
[1:31:49] watch God overcome in your situation.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Watch him overcome. Amen. But it's
[1:31:56] putting away our identification.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Now think about this.
[1:32:02] We don't like to intrude.
[1:32:05] Most of us. I don't mind it necessarily.
[1:32:12] My wife, she's always like, "Well, we
[1:32:13] haven't been invited. I might get my
[1:32:15] daughters." Now, now it goes for my
[1:32:16] wife. Now, my daughters, my wife don't
[1:32:19] say anything because my daughters will
[1:32:20] say, you know,
[1:32:23] you know, and they're like, "You haven't
[1:32:24] been invited." And I told him, I was
[1:32:26] like, "Girls," I was like, "There's not
[1:32:27] a house, there's not a celebration,
[1:32:30] there's not a car, there's not an
[1:32:32] airplane ride that I am not invited to."
[1:32:37] I was like, I I can, you know, I was
[1:32:40] like, I I'm I'm invited, you know, and
[1:32:43] you know, but but for some reason, we
[1:32:44] come to God
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; as if we're not invited.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; We come to God as if we're we we're a
[1:32:54] lesser species.
[1:32:57] You know, we come to God because yes, we
[1:32:59] are fighting in our flesh. We are
[1:33:03] fighting things in our flesh. We're
[1:33:05] fighting either sicknesses or or
[1:33:07] complexes or we're fighting or we're
[1:33:09] fighting ill or ill thoughts against
[1:33:11] this person or we and we realize the
[1:33:13] gravity of our mistakes and we and we
[1:33:15] wonder how is it that we could come to a
[1:33:19] to a pure and holy uh God that has laid
[1:33:23] everything on the line for us. you know
[1:33:25] that he come from him. and we come for
[1:33:26] this and we and we wonder if we're
[1:33:28] invited and and we're hesitant to in the
[1:33:31] services to be able to lift up our hands
[1:33:33] or we're he hesitant to be able to come
[1:33:35] to an altar or we're hesitant to be able
[1:33:38] to compare ourselves with the scripture
[1:33:40] when the scripture says that ye are the
[1:33:42] sons of God and all of a sudden
[1:33:43] something in the back of your head says
[1:33:45] yeah but you remember this or oh do you
[1:33:48] remember that or or he might be talking
[1:33:50] to you know brother KBY because he's a
[1:33:52] son of God or he might be talking to you
[1:33:54] know to our to our brothers that are,
[1:33:56] you know, our our brothers that are
[1:33:57] brother Donald. I was trying to remember
[1:33:59] your name. Yeah, brother Donald. Or we
[1:34:00] or we you might be thinking about
[1:34:02] Brother Donald, you know, because
[1:34:03] Brother Donald, you know, he's he's he's
[1:34:05] so meek and he's and he's, you know,
[1:34:07] there's just a lot of good things about
[1:34:08] Brother Donald, you know, it's just a
[1:34:10] lot of good things about Brother Donald.
[1:34:11] Or or you might sit there and just think
[1:34:12] that, oh, because I'm not like this or
[1:34:14] I'm not like that that I'm not that I'm
[1:34:17] not invited. But yet, it's quite the
[1:34:18] contrary. But it's God walking through
[1:34:21] the aisles of the service and he's going
[1:34:23] back and forth and he's looking to see
[1:34:25] which heart that it is that's open and
[1:34:28] he's looking to see cuz he's not a
[1:34:29] gentleman. You know, if you want to be
[1:34:31] in service and you don't want anything
[1:34:32] to do with the service or you know,
[1:34:34] you're just here because your mom says
[1:34:36] you need to be here or your dad says you
[1:34:38] need to be here or or anything like that
[1:34:40] and you know, you don't you don't you
[1:34:42] know, there's no there's no interaction
[1:34:44] between you or the word. you know, God
[1:34:46] God's God God has a God has a way of
[1:34:48] just being like, you know, I'll get to
[1:34:49] that one a little later. You know, I got
[1:34:51] some things for him to go through. But
[1:34:53] yet, he's searching for that heart. And
[1:34:55] a lot of you elders know what I'm
[1:34:56] talking about. When you used to sit here
[1:34:58] on the front rows and your heart would
[1:34:59] be open, amen, to the things of God. But
[1:35:02] yet, but yet God's desire to
[1:35:04] communicate. God's desire to be able to
[1:35:06] work one-on-one with man is greater than
[1:35:09] than any theologian is, is greater than
[1:35:12] any psychologist, is any greater than
[1:35:14] anything. But his desire is for that
[1:35:16] one-on-one fellowship that you can that
[1:35:19] that the world won't be able to tell the
[1:35:21] difference between you and God. And and
[1:35:24] when they look at you, they see God.
[1:35:26] When they look at him, they're like,
[1:35:28] "You know what? If there's anybody that
[1:35:30] that would remind me of Jesus, that
[1:35:31] would be brother so and so. You know, he
[1:35:33] you know, I'm sure he fights his
[1:35:35] battles, but yet he just presses right
[1:35:37] along." And and thinking about this, I
[1:35:39] look at one of the a quote that I had
[1:35:40] come across and it says, "Now remember
[1:35:43] after Jesus doing this when nobody else
[1:35:46] could do it, we are invited."
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:35:53] you're invited now. You're invited right
[1:35:55] here at this very minute. Right at this
[1:35:57] very moment. I mean, it's not going to
[1:35:58] be something that's far off, but it's
[1:36:00] something that's calling out every
[1:36:02] service. That's something that's calling
[1:36:04] out every song service. something that's
[1:36:05] calling out every time the minister gets
[1:36:07] up here. He says that you are invited.
[1:36:09] Now, church, think of this just a
[1:36:11] minute. We are invited to shape our own
[1:36:16] character to his by grace. We are
[1:36:19] invited, think of it, to become
[1:36:22] characters like his. If we are ready to
[1:36:26] lay lay our character down and the
[1:36:29] molding that we had, high-minded, lovers
[1:36:32] of pleasure, more than lovers of God,
[1:36:34] false accusers, incontinent, despisers
[1:36:36] of those that are trying to do right,
[1:36:38] having the form of the God of godliness,
[1:36:40] but denying the power of the word,
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; denying the sustained ability, not we're
[1:36:46] not talking about a form. We're not
[1:36:48] talking about, hey, brother so and so,
[1:36:49] nice suit or this or that, you know, but
[1:36:51] we're we're talking about that night
[1:36:53] that that night time that at the very
[1:36:55] end of the day when the chips or the
[1:36:57] rubber meets the road, the chips have
[1:36:58] all fallen, you know, where you stand
[1:37:00] with God and God says, "I'm inviting you
[1:37:04] at this critical moment in of life,
[1:37:06] right before the rapture takes place.
[1:37:08] I'm going to send a message your way
[1:37:10] that you can shape your character, that
[1:37:13] you could shape your life, that you
[1:37:15] could shape everything that you are."
[1:37:17] Amen. To my desire of the word.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; He says pleasure or he says and God
[1:37:24] trying to do that having a form of
[1:37:26] godliness and then designing or denying
[1:37:28] the power of the word. How God or how
[1:37:31] can God come into a place like that when
[1:37:35] they deny the word?
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Michael, I'm not
[1:37:39] denying the word. What are you talking
[1:37:40] about? You know, I I I don't deny the
[1:37:42] word. I come to church. I do. We're not
[1:37:44] talking about attendance.
[1:37:47] We're not talking about, you know, I
[1:37:49] mean, because, you know, if you think
[1:37:50] about it, when Jesus's got church got
[1:37:52] too big, I was listening to the quote
[1:37:53] when brother Brandon was speaking. He
[1:37:55] was like, when the church got too big,
[1:37:56] he'd just throw something unusual out
[1:37:58] there. And he would look out there and
[1:37:59] he'd be like, "Church got too big.
[1:38:00] Unless you drink my blood and eat my
[1:38:02] flesh, you'll have no part of me."
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; 200. See you.
[1:38:08] 200 of them just left like that. But
[1:38:12] there was something different inside the
[1:38:13] disciples. There was something different
[1:38:16] inside of Peter and James and John and
[1:38:19] some of these that were different that
[1:38:20] inside because when Jesus turned around
[1:38:21] to him and he was like, "Are you going
[1:38:23] to leave me also?" Peter's like, "Where
[1:38:25] could we go for thou hast of the words
[1:38:27] of eternal life?" Amen. They could
[1:38:29] identify Jesus with the words that the
[1:38:32] prophets were were preaching for the for
[1:38:35] in the times past. They could take back
[1:38:36] and they could look and they could say
[1:38:38] they could look back and say, "Now,
[1:38:39] wasn't it very interesting that the that
[1:38:41] the preachers and the priests couldn't
[1:38:43] even identify Jesus who she was, but a
[1:38:46] prostitute at the well could say could
[1:38:48] sit back and could look and say, "You
[1:38:49] know what? I've heard of these kinds of
[1:38:51] things. You know, I've heard that when
[1:38:52] the Messiah comes out, he would do these
[1:38:54] kinds of things." And all of a sudden he
[1:38:56] sits out there and he's like, "I'm he,"
[1:38:58] you know, and but yet the priests would
[1:39:00] sit there and question of who he was and
[1:39:02] and question and and let me tell you
[1:39:04] something. We got to be careful to not
[1:39:06] sit in the place of the of the Sadducees
[1:39:09] and the Pharisees and sit here in church
[1:39:11] and sit here and try to decipher whether
[1:39:13] or not this is the word or that's not
[1:39:15] the word or or you know what that that
[1:39:17] that portion of scripture doesn't
[1:39:19] doesn't pertain to me. But yet we got to
[1:39:21] be able to sit back and be able to be
[1:39:23] like, you know what, amen, the the
[1:39:25] scripture says, amen, that that that
[1:39:27] that through Christ we can overcome. And
[1:39:30] the message that the pastor is preaching
[1:39:32] or the message, amen, that the
[1:39:33] evangelist preaches or or or the song
[1:39:36] that's being sung, it identifies itself
[1:39:38] with the word. And with that sword, with
[1:39:41] that sword of the word, you'll be able
[1:39:42] to cut down any adversary that comes
[1:39:45] into your life. Amen. You're go you're
[1:39:48] struggling with certain things in your
[1:39:49] life here this evening. You can take the
[1:39:51] sword of the word. Amen. You can
[1:39:52] identify it. You can identify it with
[1:39:54] the scripture and you can go and Satan
[1:39:56] has to bow. Amen. You could go and you
[1:39:59] could say, you know what, Lord, I I need
[1:40:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and
[1:40:02] Lord, I'm cutting them down. You know
[1:40:04] what? You know what? You know, God
[1:40:06] doesn't want you to fall and we're not
[1:40:10] leaving a grace or a license for sin
[1:40:12] that takes place. But you would rather
[1:40:15] be trying. You would rather be sitting
[1:40:18] the sitting in the sitting in the back
[1:40:20] room somewhere and you're struggling or
[1:40:21] you're dealing with something that
[1:40:23] that's hereditary in your life and
[1:40:25] you're sitting back and you're grabbing
[1:40:26] hold. You're grabbing the hold of of
[1:40:28] God's word and you're sticking right
[1:40:30] there to it. Amen. You watch God as he
[1:40:32] moves on the scene. Yeah. The Hebrew
[1:40:34] boys, you know, they got thrown in the
[1:40:36] fire and we they had the scripture that
[1:40:38] they weren't to bow before the graven
[1:40:40] images. And when they'd come to that
[1:40:42] place that they had realized they
[1:40:43] because they could have bowed just like
[1:40:44] everybody else in the crowd. Sure.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; They're going to bow just like everybody
[1:40:48] and nobody would have noticed who they
[1:40:50] are. Amen. But they made they made
[1:40:52] Christ living for today because Christ
[1:40:55] ain't Christ ain't bowing to nobody and
[1:40:58] for and Amen. The scripture says that
[1:41:00] every knee shall bow before him. Every
[1:41:03] tongue will confess before him. Amen. So
[1:41:05] his people shouldn't be bowing before
[1:41:07] any graven images. And you shouldn't bow
[1:41:09] before sickness and you shouldn't bow
[1:41:11] before you shouldn't bow before
[1:41:14] depression. You shouldn't bow before
[1:41:16] those thoughts that are coming through
[1:41:17] your through your mind. Amen. About your
[1:41:19] family's health, about the different
[1:41:21] your job situation. You shouldn't bow
[1:41:23] before those things. Amen. But you stand
[1:41:25] right there. You know where God come
[1:41:27] from. You know where God's taken you.
[1:41:29] And you know what he's going to do with
[1:41:30] you when he's finished.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Finish my quote here. He says, "Do also
[1:41:38] that the life that I live shall live in
[1:41:40] you." Oh no. It says we've got to take
[1:41:43] the entire full gospel. Oh no, I'm still
[1:41:46] not there. And the word just pushes it
[1:41:49] out. He can't identify himself or how
[1:41:53] can he identify with himself with
[1:41:54] something like that? We've got to take
[1:41:56] the entire full gospel, we must and now
[1:41:58] being that we have identify ourselves as
[1:42:01] full gospel people, let's mold our
[1:42:03] character. We in we in in we're invited
[1:42:07] to be molded in his image that we might
[1:42:10] reflect his presence.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; And the works that I do shall you do
[1:42:17] also. The life that I live so shall you.
[1:42:21] We're invited by God to take him as an
[1:42:24] example. As an example and let our
[1:42:27] characteristics be molded like this.
[1:42:30] What what a thing. I then when when we
[1:42:33] let his characteristics be in us, then
[1:42:37] we have become sons by having the mind
[1:42:40] of Christ. Mind which is his character.
[1:42:44] Your mind makes your character. Let the
[1:42:47] mind Paul said of Christ, this mind that
[1:42:50] was in Christ be in you. Let the mind of
[1:42:52] Christ be in you. It molds the character
[1:42:55] of a son of God now or it molds the
[1:42:58] character of a son of God. So that mind
[1:43:01] of Christ that is in you when nobody
[1:43:04] else is around
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; when you're not with your brother or
[1:43:08] you're not with your sister. Amen. And
[1:43:11] the enemy is fighting your mind.
[1:43:13] All of us are are fought. Doesn't matter
[1:43:15] if you're a young person, if you're an
[1:43:17] older or if you're an elder in the
[1:43:18] church, but you're being fought daily.
[1:43:20] But if you let this mind that is in
[1:43:24] Christ
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; be in you.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; When Christ came and he overcome the
[1:43:30] devil, he overcome death.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; He overcome sickness. He overcome
[1:43:35] blindness. He overcome uh he overcome
[1:43:37] the the the the maniac of Gadie. He
[1:43:40] overcome he overcome the the physical
[1:43:42] elements of the air when he when when he
[1:43:44] when he when he stopped the storm when
[1:43:46] he was going over the deal. That same
[1:43:48] mind that's within you. You can overcome
[1:43:51] the enemy of your soul.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; You can overcome the enemy of your soul
[1:43:56] because it's not you that Satan's
[1:43:59] fighting, but it's Christ in you, the
[1:44:02] word. Amen. That he has to come against.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; He was defeated.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; He was defeated.
[1:44:12] He wasn't defeated. You know that the
[1:44:15] you know, brother Ram talks about all
[1:44:16] the powers that Jesus had, but yet he
[1:44:18] used the word All right.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And it's the word that's within you that
[1:44:22] identifies
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; your life to him.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Sister Carol, when you're at work, they
[1:44:28] look at you and they see Christ in you.
[1:44:31] They realize that, you know what?
[1:44:32] There's something different about Sister
[1:44:33] Carol. You know, there's something
[1:44:35] that's within her life that when when
[1:44:36] when the rubber meets the road that that
[1:44:38] that that Amen. that that that she
[1:44:41] follows the scripture. She follows the
[1:44:43] word.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; The word is who? It's not brother
[1:44:45] Windle. It's not me. It's Christ.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Christ that's within them.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Now the characteristics that we take,
[1:44:58] you can say my characteristics. Yes,
[1:45:02] we know Christ by his characteristics
[1:45:04] when he came.
[1:45:07] As we said, as we said before, the the
[1:45:08] the the the woman at the well,
[1:45:13] she ident was able to identify who
[1:45:15] Christ was when he came to the well.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; The lady with the issue of blood, she
[1:45:21] identified who that man was. Therefore,
[1:45:24] she had the faith to be able to fight
[1:45:27] past the crowd to be able to know that
[1:45:30] if I could just touch a hand garment
[1:45:32] that God is so powerful,
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; that he is so powerful, that he is so
[1:45:37] magnificent, so that he is so great that
[1:45:40] just me touching the hymn of his
[1:45:42] garment. Now, what he has to do is he
[1:45:44] has to have that faith word to respond.
[1:45:48] There has to be something. I noticed
[1:45:49] that when Jesus was touched, he says,
[1:45:51] "Who touched me?" And Peter's like, you
[1:45:53] know, everybody's touching. He's like,
[1:45:54] but but when that touched me, it was the
[1:45:57] only thing that was comparable to Jesus.
[1:46:00] It was the only thing. You can't compare
[1:46:01] works. You can't compare anything but
[1:46:03] his word when his word touched him. When
[1:46:06] his word when the when those
[1:46:07] characteristics of the word that was
[1:46:08] inside of her touched Jesus, it drained
[1:46:11] him of his ability because it was the
[1:46:13] only thing because what it was, it was
[1:46:15] two omnipotent meeting. It was two major
[1:46:18] forces coming together and colliding to
[1:46:21] perform a miracle because it was a son
[1:46:24] of God. It was a daughter of God that
[1:46:26] was taking taking the word and it was
[1:46:29] bringing it back to the master and the
[1:46:31] master was having to and the master was
[1:46:34] digging into the spiritual piggy bank or
[1:46:37] spiritual bank of his word and giving
[1:46:39] receiving because she had written the
[1:46:41] check for healing. And we've got to have
[1:46:43] the same style of faith that when we
[1:46:46] come to God that Lord, this is what you
[1:46:48] said. Lord, this is what you promised.
[1:46:50] I'm a child and I'm in the I'm in the
[1:46:52] active service for your in of your army
[1:46:55] and this is what I need. And God will be
[1:46:57] obligated to meet your need.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; You know what?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; God likes to show off.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; God likes to show off. You know, I like
[1:47:08] to show off.
[1:47:10] I can't do a whole lot of showing off
[1:47:12] anymore, but I like, you know, when the
[1:47:14] kids come out and they're they're like,
[1:47:16] "Oh, build this and build that." And I'm
[1:47:18] always like, "I don't have the material
[1:47:20] for this or I would, you know, you know,
[1:47:22] or oh, you know, but God likes to show
[1:47:25] off." You know, sometimes we get in
[1:47:27] situations of our life where we where
[1:47:29] God puts himself in a position to where
[1:47:31] he's like, "You know what? I know what
[1:47:34] they're going to do. That's why I chose
[1:47:35] them." you know, and and they're fixing
[1:47:37] to hit this portion in their life, you
[1:47:40] know, where I'm working unusually. Why
[1:47:43] would why would I send a why would I
[1:47:44] send a child or why would I send, you
[1:47:46] know, a mother or why would I send a
[1:47:48] father or why would I send a young
[1:47:49] person through this situation, you know,
[1:47:51] to be able to go through this? And it
[1:47:53] seems like it's so bleak and it seems
[1:47:54] like it's the wrong time and it seems
[1:47:56] like it's it's not going to happen and
[1:47:58] it seems like these, you know, and
[1:47:59] they're going to be so discouraged and
[1:48:01] they're going to be such into a place to
[1:48:03] where to where they're going to call on
[1:48:04] my name and and I'm going to use this
[1:48:07] situation, you know, to be able to
[1:48:09] glorify God amongst the people, you
[1:48:12] know, and there's only one avenue that
[1:48:14] can happen and that's through you.
[1:48:16] You're the avenue that God can be made
[1:48:18] manifest in in the in the in the time
[1:48:20] that we live in. Now we want to go back
[1:48:23] and be identifying Christ by his
[1:48:26] characteristics here. Here here in the
[1:48:27] message here it says it says God has
[1:48:30] raised him up from the dead and today
[1:48:33] his characterist characteristics as it
[1:48:35] seem as or as it same as it was
[1:48:41] I'm going to get that right. It says God
[1:48:43] has raised him up from the dead and
[1:48:45] today his characteristics as it same as
[1:48:49] it was then and the returning of the
[1:48:52] days of Sodom as Jesus prophesied the
[1:48:55] same thing um the same thing is to take
[1:48:58] place when the son is being revealed to
[1:49:01] the prophet it's identification of his
[1:49:04] characteristics
[1:49:05] Hebrews 14 4:14 and 15 he is now our
[1:49:09] high priest that can be touched by the
[1:49:12] feeling of our infirmities just like he
[1:49:15] was then. Do you believe that our
[1:49:18] infirmities touch him? Well, if you
[1:49:21] would touch him, how would he act if he
[1:49:24] was the same yesterday,
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; today, and forever? His characteristics
[1:49:29] would be the same. Then he'd act like he
[1:49:32] did when when the woman touched his
[1:49:35] garment. Do you believe that he ever
[1:49:38] lives? he has ever lives and his
[1:49:41] characteristics still identify him today
[1:49:45] as he was then.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that with all your heart?
[1:49:50] Now listen to the great part. Do you
[1:49:52] believe that with all your heart? God
[1:49:54] identified by his characteristics. It
[1:49:57] identifies it or it identifies him.
[1:50:00] Amen. One more thing. It says he says
[1:50:02] characteristics of the promise or sorry
[1:50:05] that was me. I said that. It said today
[1:50:07] Luther said when you believe you've got
[1:50:10] it. The Methodists say when you shout
[1:50:12] you got it. The Pentecostals say when
[1:50:13] you speak in tongues that you had it. We
[1:50:16] find all this wrong. Some of them say
[1:50:19] the fruit of the spirit got it. And
[1:50:21] that's wrong. The only evidence is when
[1:50:24] when the vindication when God himself
[1:50:27] identifies himself in the promised word
[1:50:30] of the hour. There it is. He says, "Who
[1:50:33] had any more fruits of the spirit than
[1:50:35] them kind old priests?" Think about
[1:50:38] this. Circumcised the children and
[1:50:41] blessed them and everything else. And
[1:50:43] here this guy Jesus was come over,
[1:50:46] kicked over the sacrifice blocks, looked
[1:50:49] upon them with anger, beat them, run
[1:50:52] them out. No identification of nothing.
[1:50:54] The scripture is his identification. He
[1:50:57] had no fellowship card. He belonged to
[1:51:00] no congregation. But God spoke of him.
[1:51:03] That that was that was his
[1:51:06] identification. That's the genuine
[1:51:08] identification of God in any hour.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; In any hour. Amen. That God spoke of him
[1:51:15] at any hour. It is his identification.
[1:51:18] That's what it is. The scriptures that's
[1:51:19] promised made identified by the
[1:51:22] characteristics of the promise which God
[1:51:25] is. And God is the word. and the
[1:51:28] characteristic of the promise being
[1:51:30] identified. There's a lot going on right
[1:51:32] here. Okay, it says and the
[1:51:34] characteristics of that promise being
[1:51:37] identified
[1:51:39] that makes the believer.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus said so and that settles it.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Did y'all just hear that? Amen. He says
[1:51:47] he says and made identified by the
[1:51:50] characteristics of the promise which is
[1:51:52] God and God is the word and the
[1:51:54] characteristics of that promise being
[1:51:57] identified that makes the believer the
[1:52:00] characteristics that you portray of
[1:52:03] Jesus Christ in your life. Amen.
[1:52:07] Identifies the living Christ of this
[1:52:10] hour. Amen. Because you're meant to
[1:52:13] overcome. You're to fulfill the
[1:52:15] scriptures in its entirety through the
[1:52:18] characteristics of Jesus Christ being
[1:52:21] distributed in this generation. Amen.
[1:52:24] Identifies you as Christ living
[1:52:27] breathing among men.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. As as our musicians
[1:52:33] come,
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; but he identifies himself by his
[1:52:39] characteristics.
[1:52:40] The word is his characteristics that's
[1:52:42] being brought in front of man to be
[1:52:44] displayed today. Today we live in a time
[1:52:47] where there's lot of identification
[1:52:49] that's going on in the world. There's a
[1:52:51] lot of there's a lot of people claiming
[1:52:52] to identify with Christ. Therefore,
[1:52:54] we've got millions of churches and we've
[1:52:57] got we've got different denominations
[1:52:59] that come but only one is identifying
[1:53:02] himself. God only came or Christ when he
[1:53:05] came he came and identified or God when
[1:53:07] he came he came and identified himself
[1:53:09] through one man and that was Jesus
[1:53:11] Christ at that present time and he came
[1:53:13] and when he identified himself it wasn't
[1:53:15] the oh the Sadducees said oh the
[1:53:18] Pharisees said oh I I'm God because just
[1:53:22] John said it was like no search the
[1:53:24] scriptures
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; search the scriptures
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; because the scriptures identify who I am
[1:53:31] Come on.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; we look at that as if that's just God,
[1:53:37] if that's just Christ, if that's just,
[1:53:40] you know, something that when he was to
[1:53:42] come for fulfillment of this day. But
[1:53:44] no, you're to search the scriptures.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; You're to find your place in the age
[1:53:50] that you live in so you can you can
[1:53:53] follow the same characteristics and the
[1:53:55] footsteps that Jesus has. So you can be
[1:53:58] identified by this world that we lived
[1:54:00] in. Then we look back right here what we
[1:54:03] said right here at the day of Pentecost
[1:54:04] where they said that you know what he's
[1:54:07] they're ignorant and they're unlearned.
[1:54:10] But this one thing we know that they've
[1:54:12] been with Jesus.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; We're ignorant
[1:54:22] and unlearned.
[1:54:24] But let them be able to say, "But you
[1:54:26] know what? Those are some Christian
[1:54:28] people."
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; They might not be able to sing
[1:54:34] or they might not be able to preach or
[1:54:36] they might not have this right. They
[1:54:38] might not, you know, the fundamentals
[1:54:39] might seem to be, but you know what?
[1:54:41] They live the they can identify
[1:54:43] themselves with Christ.
[1:54:46] And that's where we want to be at here
[1:54:48] this evening.
[1:54:50] We don't want to identify ourselves with
[1:54:52] our attitudes or with our way that we
[1:54:55] see life because as we could see that
[1:54:57] life has been going on from time after
[1:55:00] time after time life's been moving on
[1:55:02] and it's just just it's making this big
[1:55:04] circle.
[1:55:06] A lot of things are just coming around
[1:55:08] and we know that styles and fashions and
[1:55:11] we know that sings or presidents or
[1:55:13] celebrities or or anything or anybody
[1:55:15] that's that's that's in that realm is
[1:55:17] one day it's all going to pass away.
[1:55:20] But there's one thing that's remains and
[1:55:22] that's the solid rock of the gospel.
[1:55:27] And that's where we want to be at here
[1:55:28] this evening is we want to be able to
[1:55:30] say that I identify not with a church.
[1:55:34] I don't want to identify with just the
[1:55:36] church, but I want to identify myself
[1:55:40] with the one that saved me. I want to
[1:55:43] identify myself with with the one that
[1:55:45] that that is reaching out for me. The
[1:55:47] one that that the one that calls to me
[1:55:49] in the evenings and and desires
[1:55:52] fellowship in my life and desires to
[1:55:54] spend eternity with me. I want to
[1:55:57] identify myself with something that's
[1:55:58] everlasting.
[1:56:01] And you know what? A lot of times that a
[1:56:03] lot of times the identification comes
[1:56:05] because there's a desire that's there.
[1:56:09] God's called that desire to be there.
[1:56:11] It's just that we've been in a place of
[1:56:13] amnesia. We've been in a place where
[1:56:15] where we've lost our identification as
[1:56:18] believers. We've lost our identification
[1:56:21] as as sons and daughters of God. And
[1:56:23] therefore therefore we we run we run
[1:56:25] church as if it's a religion or we run
[1:56:27] church as if it's a basketball game or
[1:56:29] we or we run churches if it's just a
[1:56:31] place for us to come or it's just become
[1:56:33] common. But but really what church is is
[1:56:35] a place to for you to explore who you
[1:56:39] were in God before the world began.
[1:56:43] It's a place that you could come and you
[1:56:45] can identify yourself with. You know
[1:56:47] what? I'm tired of these things that I
[1:56:50] identify my life with. And I would my
[1:56:52] desire is to be part of God's
[1:56:55] characteristics.
[1:56:57] Let his life be in me. Let me be able to
[1:57:00] exhibit that life to the world. Amen. Do
[1:57:03] you love him?
[1:57:05] Let's stand to our feet here this
[1:57:07] evening.
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:16] Amen. What are we saying in co,
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Lord? Make me more like you.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Let the light of your love shine it
[1:57:31] through.
[1:57:34] Teach me, Lord, to do
[1:57:38] things you want me to.
[1:57:41] [Music]
[1:57:44] Even though they persecuted me and the
[1:57:48] world
[1:57:50] against me, it's my side to make me more
[1:57:56] like you.
[1:57:58] Make me more like you,
[1:58:02] baby. More like you.

[1:58:18] the things you want me to.
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:24] Even though he persecuted me and the
[1:58:29] world
[1:58:31] against me, it's my desire to make me
[1:58:36] more like
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:45] you love him here this evening.
[1:58:48] Is that your desires to be more like
[1:58:50] him?
[1:58:52] to shake off the things of the world and
[1:58:54] to shake off the things that are to just
[1:58:57] keep us earthbound, if that's the way
[1:58:59] that you want to put it. Are there
[1:59:00] things that you're not identifying the
[1:59:03] way that God identifies it or the way
[1:59:06] that God sees you in his scripture as
[1:59:08] the overcomer or as healed or as, you
[1:59:12] know, taking his word and being able to
[1:59:15] bring it to reality in your life.
[1:59:18] Sometimes it's not necessarily an
[1:59:20] outward showing, but God's vindicating,
[1:59:22] revealing himself in your life as a
[1:59:25] healer, as a creator. Amen. As a need
[1:59:29] meter.
[1:59:31] But first, you got to be able to see
[1:59:32] yourself in scripture.
[1:59:35] First, you got to be able to be able to
[1:59:37] surrender your desires and your wills so
[1:59:39] that God can work within your life. And
[1:59:42] you do that here this evening. Amen. Let
[1:59:45] God identify himself within you.
[1:59:48] Let him be able to Let him be able to
[1:59:51] exhibit himself through you that the
[1:59:55] world can see.
[1:59:58] That's what makes you a Messiah and
[2:00:00] Messiah present tense in the world that
[2:00:03] we live in. Amen.
[2:00:06] As we get ready for our pastor to come,
[2:00:08] we'll just sing that song again.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Make me more like you.
[2:00:16] Make me more like you.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Let the light of your love come shining
[2:00:26] through.
[2:00:28] Teach me Lord to do
[2:00:32] things you want me to.
[2:00:38] Even though they persecuted me and the
[2:00:42] world turned against me, it's my desire
[2:00:48] to make me more like you.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Make me more like you.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Make me more like you.
[2:01:00] [Music]
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Let the light of your love come shining
[2:01:06] through.
[2:01:08] Teach me, Lord, to do
[2:01:12] things you want me to do.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Even though they persecuted me and the
[2:01:22] world turned against me, it's my desire
[2:01:28] to make you.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:01:51] As long as you're fighting and resisting
[2:01:53] God,
[2:01:56] you'll never know God.
[2:02:00] But sometimes we've
[2:02:03] we've got to get fed up with ourselves,
[2:02:06] fed up with our situations,
[2:02:09] fed up and say, "Lord, I
[2:02:15] I I need you.
[2:02:18] I I I
[2:02:21] I'll
[2:02:23] yield myself to you. I'll I'll give
[2:02:26] myself to you if you'll live through me.

[2:02:50] to you, Lord. You may mold me. You make
[2:02:54] me.

[2:03:03] Holy Spirit has has been dealing with in
[2:03:06] your in your life tonight through this
[2:03:09] message? I believe the Lord spoke to us
[2:03:12] tonight.

[2:03:36] and that great eternal logos who wrote
[2:03:39] the book in the first place is
[2:03:41] identified in our day and said, "Listen,
[2:03:43] if you'll just open up, I'll live this
[2:03:46] Bible through you.
[2:03:49] I'll declare my glory.
[2:03:54] Identify yourself in me, Lord.
[2:03:58] Take bitterness out. Take selfishness
[2:04:00] out. Take whatever out of me, Lord,
[2:04:05] but I want to be your body.
[2:04:09] If you've grown stagnant in your walk
[2:04:11] with God, say, "Lord, I'm sorry
[2:04:14] because this is not your
[2:04:16] characteristics. You're You're a burning

[2:04:29] Help me, Jesus.
[2:04:32] You know these this just just that just
[2:04:34] that earnest cry in our heart to reflect
[2:04:38] it. You've saved me. You've called me. I
[2:04:43] know you have.
[2:04:45] Now Lord,

[2:05:06] I'm going to be me and
[2:05:09] you know, I don't care what God and his
[2:05:11] word says.
[2:05:13] Is that the way you really want it to
[2:05:15] be?
[2:05:18] Do you really want that in your life?
[2:05:20] Don't you want God to come in and mold
[2:05:23] you and make you something great for
[2:05:25] him?
[2:05:27] Isn't that what we want?

[2:18:21] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
[2:18:25] Bless the Lord.
[2:18:28] We have identified ourselves with his
[2:18:31] characteristics today.
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:37] I'm glad we're not bowing to an image of
[2:18:40] Christ,
[2:18:43] but we're bowing to a living Christ.
[2:18:46] We worship a living Christ.
[2:18:51] And again, his word is not just
[2:18:55] letters that make up words that have put
[2:18:57] been put on a printed page. This is a
[2:18:59] living God.
[2:19:02] And it requires a real surrender of our
[2:19:04] heart for that living word to come upon
[2:19:08] us.
[2:19:10] brothers, if there's ever a time for
[2:19:12] consecration,
[2:19:13] sisters as well, consecration and
[2:19:16] dedication to the Lord,
[2:19:19] Lord,
[2:19:21] I want to surrender myself to you
[2:19:24] in a greater way. I want to I want that
[2:19:28] word to be imprinted on my heart, my
[2:19:31] mind,
[2:19:33] that it becomes a part of who I am.
[2:19:37] I think that's the desire of every one
[2:19:39] of us.
[2:19:42] Amen.
[2:19:44] We love him here tonight.
[2:19:47] We appreciated the word of the Lord. Did
[2:19:49] you enjoy the word of the Lord tonight?
[2:19:51] [Applause]
[2:19:57] And um we're just so thankful for the
[2:20:00] goodness of the Lord.
[2:20:03] And um wasn't it wonderful to see Stacia
[2:20:07] baptized this morning or not Stacia uh
[2:20:11] Shayla baptized this morning and uh
[2:20:16] [Applause]
[2:20:20] I walked into the to the room there and
[2:20:24] and uh where her where she and sister
[2:20:29] Denise was waiting and
[2:20:32] she She had great big tears
[2:20:35] coming down her face.
[2:20:37] [Music]
[2:20:40] So thankful for what God is doing in her
[2:20:43] life. And
[2:20:45] it just isn't that just wonderful.
[2:20:48] Say someone say, "Lord, here I am."
[2:20:51] [Applause]
[2:20:55] And you know, I've been serving the Lord
[2:20:56] a long time now,
[2:20:59] but I still have that desire.
[2:21:04] And I I sometimes I get a little crusty,
[2:21:06] get get a little You just get used to
[2:21:10] things, don't you?
[2:21:12] But I tell you what, God is still living
[2:21:14] and sometimes we just need to go and
[2:21:18] fall in love with him all over again.
[2:21:21] And u so we have been blessed. I I look
[2:21:26] there at of course just so blessed to
[2:21:28] see that. I I I see what God's doing in
[2:21:32] Patrick and Stacia
[2:21:35] and um
[2:21:38] and to see the beautiful work that that
[2:21:42] he is doing and and I believe the more
[2:21:44] that that that
[2:21:46] they surrender to the Lord, the the
[2:21:48] greater they're going to know him.
[2:21:52] And I think that's the way it is with us
[2:21:54] all.
[2:21:56] Remember,
[2:21:58] every every stage of brother Brandham's
[2:22:01] life, every
[2:22:03] when the when the second pool was
[2:22:05] coming, Brother Brandham says, "You've
[2:22:06] got to be more sinc" or the angel said,
[2:22:08] "You've got to be more sincere." The
[2:22:10] third pull was coming, you've got to be
[2:22:12] more sincere.
[2:22:14] And I I I think that rings true for
[2:22:16] every one of us.
[2:22:19] God says, "If you want to come up
[2:22:20] higher, if you want to come closer, if
[2:22:23] you want me to be more real in your
[2:22:25] life, then you've got to be more
[2:22:27] sincere,
[2:22:29] you've got you've got to pull pull off
[2:22:31] to your alone with you and God, and then
[2:22:35] God will reveal himself to you in a
[2:22:38] greater way." Listen, you cannot set
[2:22:42] aside that special time with the Lord
[2:22:45] and him not come. Now, you might not
[2:22:47] feel him at first because your mind is
[2:22:49] so wrapped up in the in the realities or
[2:22:52] the the craziness of this world. But if
[2:22:54] you'll just if you'll sit there long
[2:22:56] enough, you'll stop long enough.
[2:23:00] Let the let your mind and whatever else
[2:23:02] know that I'm going to sit here until I
[2:23:05] can I can know that his presence is
[2:23:08] here. He'll meet with you. And I'm so
[2:23:12] glad for that because he is very very
[2:23:16] much real and alive. God bless you
[2:23:19] tonight.
[2:23:21] We
[2:23:23] have got our uh meeting coming up and
[2:23:27] and so um
[2:23:30] we're we're sure looking forward to what
[2:23:33] God is is uh has got in store for us.

[2:23:42] air. And um and so we're just believing
