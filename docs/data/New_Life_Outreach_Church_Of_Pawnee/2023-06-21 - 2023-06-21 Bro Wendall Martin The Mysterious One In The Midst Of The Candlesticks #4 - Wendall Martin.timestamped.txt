[36:52] man clothed with a garment down to the
[36:54] foot
[36:55] gird about the paps with a golden girdle
[36:58] his head and his hair was white like
[37:01] wool as white as snow
[37:04] his eyes were as flame of fire
[37:07] his feet likened to Brass as if they
[37:11] burned in a furnace
[37:13] his voice as the sound of many Waters
[37:16] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[37:19] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[37:22] two-edged sword
[37:24] and his countenance was as the sun
[37:26] shineth in his strength
[37:29] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[37:32] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[37:34] saying unto me
[37:35] fear not I am the first and the last I
[37:39] am he that liveth and was dead and
[37:42] behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and
[37:45] have the geese of hell and of death

[38:44] and amen God bless you you may be seated
[38:48] amen it's good to
[38:51] see Maya here uh today I uh she she
[38:57] sprang her wrist really bad and so we've
[38:59] been praying for her and
[39:02] um how many loves Amaya
[39:04] [Applause]
[39:08] amen you Fellers on the front row might
[39:09] as well come right on over here so y'all
[39:11] can see the chalkboard
[39:13] or not the chalkboard but the dry eraser
[39:15] board amen might end up over there
[39:18] tonight and that matters of fact it
[39:22] would probably be a good idea for
[39:24] everyone over there in that section on
[39:25] these Wednesday nights so you can you
[39:27] can see but we this mysterious one
[39:32] walking in the midst of the candlesticks
[39:34] we see we have been going through the
[39:38] Sevenfold personage of Christ
[39:42] and we have been dealing with the with
[39:45] the
[39:46] um
[39:47] uh
[39:49] the revelation of God this is this is
[39:52] dealing with the deity
[39:55] of Jesus Christ that that Jesus was the
[39:59] body that God created now amen it's hard
[40:03] for trinitarians to see that but you
[40:06] cannot
[40:07] you cannot go from the Old Testament of
[40:10] the Lord our God is one God and then
[40:15] come into the New Testament and say the
[40:17] Lord our God is three there are not
[40:21] three it's one God
[40:24] in three offices
[40:27] amen and so people will walk away from
[40:29] you just right now they'll just say all
[40:31] right that's all we can and Trinity is
[40:34] not even in the Bible Trinity was never
[40:36] mentioned in the Bible but you see it's
[40:39] it's a it it's Catholic dogma amen that
[40:43] that was brought in in uh A.D 325 at the
[40:49] nice end Council this is when they
[40:51] introduced and I want to say Amen the
[40:54] Catholics weren't the first to come up
[40:56] with three gods
[40:58] amen hey that came all the way from
[41:00] Babylon we're talking about thousands of
[41:03] years they worship amen uh the sun god
[41:08] the son had a mother there there was an
[41:12] old man I mean this is you can go back
[41:14] and look look in his lips to Babylons
[41:16] and you'll find out amen that the
[41:19] Catholic church and what they brought in
[41:21] was they they just erased they just
[41:25] erased Jupiter's name and and put a
[41:27] saying in there that that was that is
[41:30] not even that's not even close to being
[41:32] accurate uh um according to scripture
[41:36] and so amen so when we look at that one
[41:39] God Amen it is it is not three person
[41:43] you can't have a person without having a
[41:45] personality so they they they they say
[41:48] one God in three persons amen that don't
[41:51] even make sense amen there's one God in
[41:54] three offices it's it's God taking off
[41:59] this veil of the pillar of fire stepping
[42:03] into the body that he created and it's
[42:06] now God living by the Holy Ghost in you
[42:09] it's one God in his church that's been
[42:13] his desire the whole time and so the
[42:16] Book of Revelations here is amen this
[42:18] this first verse or in this first
[42:21] chapter here amen we find that he he is
[42:24] he says I'm the faithful witness I am
[42:27] out uh I'm from from him which is which
[42:31] was which is to come he's the faithful
[42:34] witness he's the first begotten of the
[42:37] Dead He's The Prince of the kings of the
[42:40] earth he's Alpha and Omega the beginning
[42:43] and the ending which is which was which
[42:47] is to come the almighty now this is
[42:50] Christ giving witness if you look there
[42:53] in your Bible in that in in the first
[42:55] several verses here in in Revelations 1
[42:59] it's it's written in red this is this is
[43:02] Jesus talking I am Alpha I am Omega I am
[43:06] the first I am I am the almighty God
[43:11] man so it's God uh uh revealing himself
[43:16] and so when he turns around to see who's
[43:18] doing the talking he is he's looking for
[43:21] the voice and there is the son of man
[43:23] walking in the middle of the in the
[43:26] midst of the candlesticks can you say
[43:28] Amen so so it's it's a beautiful thing
[43:31] of redemption because amen it's God
[43:33] coming down it's almighty God the
[43:36] invisible God now he's living in the
[43:40] body of Jesus to redeem us then he comes
[43:43] Amen in the power of the Holy Ghost to
[43:46] live his life through us now
[43:49] so we have gone through uh these some of
[43:53] these others he meant his head and and
[43:56] and his hair is like whoa that that was
[43:59] the judge as we have gone through his
[44:01] his feet is like undefined breath we
[44:04] talked about that last Wednesday night
[44:05] amen brass is judgment and as as Moses
[44:10] was commanded to to make a Brazen
[44:13] Serpent and to lift it up so that all
[44:16] that had sinned can look at that Brazen
[44:19] serpent they would live amen they would
[44:22] be healed from the plague and that's
[44:24] that was a type of Jesus Amen sin judge
[44:29] when Jesus he says if I be lifted up
[44:31] from the earth I will draw all men unto
[44:35] me he he was sin judge so the Judgment
[44:40] the penalty for sin was placed on the
[44:43] body of Jesus Christ and just as they
[44:47] looked and lived now we up to our lamb
[44:51] Jesus Christ and we can live oh don't
[44:56] you love him here tonight now now here
[44:58] we are amen we are now in in this fourth
[45:03] in the fourth person in Genesis and his
[45:05] voice was as the sound of many Waters
[45:08] now we understand we've already gone
[45:11] through some of this what does Waters
[45:13] represent amen y'all remember what
[45:16] Waters represent
[45:19] multitudes the scripture says they're in
[45:22] in Revelation 17 and 15 they are peoples
[45:25] multitudes Nations and tongues so when
[45:30] he now when he so when he uses the the
[45:32] the the waters the in the Book of
[45:34] Revelations then you can always go back
[45:36] all right he's dealing with multitudes
[45:39] Nations peoples and tongues amen so now
[45:45] he's saying this one that is walking in
[45:48] and out of the of the candlesticks he's
[45:51] when he utters his voice it is as the
[45:54] sound of many Waters amen and so uh we
[45:59] when we look at this now remember he's a
[46:02] judge amen he's got his wig on his eyes
[46:05] the flames of fire
[46:07] judgment is now here they have forsaken
[46:10] the words of the Lord and now judgment
[46:12] has come he is coming as a judge now
[46:16] amen so what are we let's just look just
[46:19] real quickly uh what these uh this voice
[46:22] of many waters are amen if it's
[46:25] multitudes and it's in its peoples and
[46:28] its tongues it would be the multitudes
[46:30] of witnesses who have preached the
[46:33] gospel amen and again what is the
[46:36] picture here amen it's it's it's those
[46:39] who gave voice to the Holy Spirit
[46:43] declaring the Gospel of Jesus Christ so
[46:46] so it would be the it would be the the
[46:49] seven Messengers to the seven Church
[46:52] ages it would be the it would be the
[46:54] faithful five-fold Ministry who has been
[46:57] preaching the gospel throughout the ages
[46:59] it would be it would be the Saints who
[47:02] have believed the word of God your word
[47:06] now it's not that it's not that that
[47:08] you're necessarily preachers but you are
[47:11] taking the word of God you're living
[47:13] that word you become the voice Amen
[47:18] brother Brandon would put it this way he
[47:20] says his voice was as the sound of
[47:21] multitude speaking what is it it is the
[47:25] Judgment for these are the voices of the
[47:27] multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy
[47:30] Ghost All Through the Ages have
[47:32] testified to Christ and preached his
[47:34] gospel it will be the voice of every man
[47:36] rising up in judgment Against The Sinner
[47:39] who would not take warning the voices of
[47:42] the seven Messengers will be heard loud
[47:44] and clear those faithful preachers who
[47:46] preach them saving a power of Jesus who
[47:50] preach water baptism in Jesus name who
[47:53] preach the unfilling and power of the
[47:54] holy spirit all stood with the word more
[47:58] than they stood with their own lives all
[48:00] of them were the voice of Jesus Christ
[48:04] by the Holy Ghost down to the ages amen
[48:08] now if you want to look there in in John
[48:10] 17 and 20.
[48:12] and we can turn there real quickly amen
[48:16] since this is a Bible study amen and and
[48:19] we can we can catch uh the vision here
[48:23] uh they're in John 17
[48:28] and 20.
[48:32] it says
[48:34] um
[48:36] oops I'll wait a little bit longer here
[48:38] praise the Lord you know I'm so proud of
[48:40] our young people they've got their
[48:41] Bibles and they and and they're pretty
[48:44] quick amen this is awesome
[48:46] and um and I like your notebooks and and
[48:49] uh taking notes and things because uh we
[48:52] are stopped we're just sort of slowing
[48:54] down to break it down amen and I I I
[48:58] believe the Bible says he hides it from
[49:01] the wise and the Nobles and the princes
[49:03] of this world and he reveals it unto
[49:06] babes
[49:07] I believe the Holy Spirit can reveal
[49:09] even to you young people
[49:11] none well William on these on these
[49:15] Wednesday nights we can pray Lord reveal
[49:16] yourself to me is that right amen but
[49:19] now look here at John 17 20. it says
[49:22] neither pray I for these alone but for
[49:25] them also which Shall Believe on me
[49:30] through their word
[49:33] so when he's when he's talking now amen
[49:36] multitudes people's Nations amen it is
[49:40] it is the the the entire time the of the
[49:44] seven Church ages from these last two
[49:46] thousand years from the time that Christ
[49:48] uh uh uh rose from the dead ascended
[49:52] into heaven until he comes to take us
[49:54] back amen the gospel has been preached
[49:58] and declared throughout all of those
[50:00] years but now remember he is now a judge
[50:05] he is standing there can you imagine
[50:08] every word that the preacher has
[50:10] preached amen is on record every word
[50:14] God's keeping record of of every word
[50:17] that is being preached when we stand
[50:19] there on that day we won't be able to
[50:21] say well I didn't know well I didn't
[50:24] hear well I didn't have amen God will
[50:27] pull the movie screen down and play the
[50:29] story of your life
[50:31] true well praise the Lord he's going to
[50:34] play the story he's going to play it
[50:36] amen of people who have rejected Christ
[50:39] and they're going to say well I never
[50:41] I've never heard the message well I
[50:43] never went to a message but God gave
[50:46] them an opportunity by the life you
[50:50] lived in front of them and that's why
[50:52] it's important that we live this gospel
[50:56] because your life will be then can you
[50:59] say amen amen so all of them were the
[51:03] voice of of Jesus Christ now he would
[51:06] say now have you ever thought uh how
[51:09] terrifying it is to a man drifting
[51:12] helplessly toward a cataract now think
[51:14] now of that Roar as he approaches his
[51:16] sure and certain doom and just exactly
[51:19] like that it's coming the day of
[51:21] judgment when the Roar of the multitude
[51:24] of voices condemns you for not having
[51:27] paid heed Aaron it was too late
[51:31] take heed this very hour for at this
[51:34] moment your thoughts are being recorded
[51:36] in heaven now there your thoughts speak
[51:39] louder than your words like the
[51:41] Pharisees who claim to so much with his
[51:45] mouth but not listening to the Lord his
[51:47] heart became corrupt and evil even until
[51:50] it was too late even now this could be
[51:53] your last call to hear the word and
[51:55] receive it unto eternal life it will be
[51:58] too late when you approach the Roar of
[52:01] the voices of judgment and doom but have
[52:03] you also have you ever noticed how sweet
[52:06] and relaxing the sound of water can be
[52:09] he says I like to fish I like to find a
[52:12] spot where the water is whispering in
[52:13] ripples I can just lie back and hear it
[52:17] speaking peace and joy and contentment
[52:20] to my heart how glad I am to be anchored
[52:24] in the Haven of Rest where the voice of
[52:27] the Lord speaks peace as the word of the
[52:30] Waters of separate nation has declared
[52:32] how thankful we should be to hear his
[52:35] voice of love and care and guidance and
[52:39] protection someday we will hear them
[52:42] saying Sweet Water the same sweet voice
[52:45] speak not in judgment but in welcome to
[52:48] us whose sins have been remitted by his
[52:51] blood whose lives have been
[52:53] Spirit-filled whose walk was in the word
[52:56] what could be more precious than to hear
[52:59] the multitude of welcoming voices be
[53:03] surrounded by those multitudes who have
[53:05] believed unto eternal life oh there is
[53:08] nothing like it I pray you will hear his
[53:10] voice and Harden not your heart but
[53:13] receive him as your king
[53:15] can you say amen amen now now just as
[53:19] just as the waters
[53:21] separated uh uh uh destroyed the world
[53:26] Amen it was those same Waters in Noah's
[53:29] day that destroyed the world and the
[53:31] same Waters that destroyed the world
[53:33] lifted Noah up above all of the Judgment
[53:36] same Waters the word you're listening to
[53:39] the words of Life the Bible amen that
[53:43] we're Believing on those words will be
[53:46] judgment on that day when the judge
[53:48] stands up amen now he's not going to be
[53:51] saying anything new he has sent
[53:53] witnesses to the Earth
[53:56] and those Witnesses are either going to
[53:59] be accepted or rejected
[54:02] can you say amen amen God gives that
[54:06] opportunity and so we want to listen now
[54:09] I want us to look there at the uh it
[54:12] says the next one is it says and he had
[54:15] in the 16th verse he had in his right
[54:18] hand
[54:19] Seven Stars now I want us to look at
[54:22] these Seven Stars real quickly and
[54:25] and and um I the sevens uh uh sevens of
[54:30] course we understand the right hand of
[54:32] God it speaks a position it speaks of
[54:35] authority and power that right hand uh
[54:38] amen any any time that you say on you
[54:41] know Joseph was seated at the right hand
[54:44] of pharaoh man it meant that he was
[54:47] seated in a position of authority amen
[54:51] he was in Authority so now he's got
[54:55] seven stars in his right hand
[54:59] Seven Stars in his right hand now we
[55:02] understand that if you were to go down
[55:05] there to the uh you know the 21st verse
[55:08] or the 20th verse amen it says the Seven
[55:11] Stars are the seven angels of the seven
[55:14] churches amen seven Messengers so but
[55:17] there's something about seven that has
[55:20] an incredible importance importance to
[55:22] God Amen now as God is perfected in
[55:25] threes and um amen he he's he's he's
[55:29] perfect how many believes God's
[55:31] perfected in threes he's there's the the
[55:33] numerous the numerals uh the numbers of
[55:36] God Amen uh he he works in threes he's
[55:40] perfected in threes father Son and Holy
[55:42] Ghost in in threes it's the amen uh uh
[55:46] they're in first John five and seven it
[55:48] says
[55:49] uh for there and we can turn there just
[55:52] real quickly I'm it's not exactly where
[55:54] I'm wanting to to get to but uh let's go
[55:57] ahead and turn there for some of these
[55:58] young and sake amen
[56:03] but you look there in in first John
[56:06] and uh uh five
[56:09] and the seventh verse
[56:13] praise the Lord amen it says for there
[56:16] are three that bear record in heaven the
[56:19] Father the word and the Holy Ghost
[56:22] these three are one now there's then you
[56:27] go to the next verse the exact next
[56:29] verse your new birth is completed in
[56:32] threes amen and and it says and there
[56:36] are three that bear witness in the Earth
[56:38] Spirit
[56:40] water and blood and these three agree in
[56:46] one so you've got the one God in three
[56:49] manifestations God is complete in three
[56:52] you but your new birth amen it requires
[56:57] you can have blood but you can and you
[57:00] might not have water you might have uh
[57:02] the word and you not have the blood but
[57:05] when you put them all together it
[57:07] consummates to one New Birth amen so it
[57:11] requires water even in the natural water
[57:14] blood and spirit
[57:17] to make you a human being can you say
[57:19] Amen now so in the Bible those threes
[57:23] threes are important man is is made in
[57:25] the image of God he has Body Soul and
[57:28] Spirit there are three compartments in
[57:30] the Tabernacle amen there were the outer
[57:32] courts inner courts and then there was
[57:34] the most holy Place amen and if you
[57:37] could type that out you are three you
[57:40] have you're Tabernacle you are the
[57:42] Tabernacle of God Amen there's three
[57:44] compartments you have the outer courts
[57:46] inner courts in the most holy Place Body
[57:48] Spirit and soul so we we understand
[57:52] those things that you look there at five
[57:54] five is the number of Grace amen Israel
[57:57] came out of of of Egypt in in in in in
[58:01] five in rank that David picked up five
[58:04] smooth Stones The anointing oil
[58:06] comprised of five different ingredients
[58:08] according to Exodus 30 and 23. uh there
[58:11] there was a five-fold Ministry so five
[58:13] deals with Grace
[58:16] but now sevens are really in or in
[58:20] important with God of course six is the
[58:22] number of man uh six but Man was created
[58:26] on the sixth day amen Earthly
[58:28] civilization will be for six days the
[58:30] Antichrist will be 666. so but sevens I
[58:34] want to deal with the seven for a few
[58:35] moments here uh this evening seven is
[58:39] God's number in completion now
[58:43] seven days complete one week amen God
[58:47] created the heavens and the Earth in in
[58:50] six days and God saw that it was good
[58:52] and he rested on the seventh day amen
[58:55] Madness to rest on the seventh day the
[58:59] land is to rest every seven years amen
[59:04] the Year of Jubilee was on the seventh
[59:07] year
[59:08] amen at the end of seven sabbaths would
[59:12] be the Year of Jubilee pronounced now I
[59:15] want you to look at all these sevens in
[59:16] the Bible amen there are seven colors in
[59:20] the Spectrum amen so God gave a seven
[59:24] colored rainbow sign to Noah amen there
[59:28] are seven colored rainbow uh seven
[59:31] rainbow colors are seen around the
[59:34] throne in the Book of Revelations
[59:36] there are in the book of Hebrews there
[59:39] are seven eternals amen Hebrews 1 and 6
[59:43] says he's a priest forever Hebrews one
[59:46] and nine he's he's got Eternal salvation
[59:49] Hebrews 6 and 2
[59:51] Eternal judgment Hebrews 9 and 12
[59:54] Eternal Redemption 9 and 14
[59:57] eternal spirit 9 and 15
[1:00:00] Eternal inheritance 13 and 20
[1:00:03] Everlasting Covenant so God deals with
[1:00:08] seven seven means what
[1:00:11] completion amen there's Seven Seals
[1:00:14] seven trumpets name on seven
[1:00:17] candlesticks Seven Stars amen all right
[1:00:21] amen Israel marched around a Jericho for
[1:00:27] seven days
[1:00:28] on the seventh day they marched around
[1:00:31] seven times
[1:00:33] amen there were seven priests and seven
[1:00:38] horns amen if you want to look there in
[1:00:40] Joshua 6 and 4. amen the Bible says
[1:00:43] there were seven priests shall bear
[1:00:45] before the ark seven trumpets of Ram's
[1:00:49] horns on and the seventh day you shall
[1:00:52] Compass the city seven times and the
[1:00:55] priest shall blow the trumpet so so
[1:00:57] sevens sevens represent a mountain it's
[1:01:02] a type of where we are in seven Church
[1:01:05] ages now I want you to catch this
[1:01:07] because he'd done a lot of types of
[1:01:09] sevens amen because it was it was going
[1:01:13] to mean something in the future now
[1:01:15] we're still talking about the seven
[1:01:16] candlesticks amen hallelujah I think
[1:01:20] it's interesting Elisha's servant search
[1:01:22] for rain six times but on the seventh
[1:01:25] time he got rain he saw a cloud like
[1:01:28] into a man's hand and God opened up the
[1:01:30] heaven God told Naaman go dip in Jordan
[1:01:34] seven times amen now though he dipped uh
[1:01:38] six times in hope the seventh time is
[1:01:42] when he was healed they were to hold the
[1:01:45] unleavened bread a feast of bread for
[1:01:48] seven days amen there were seven uh a
[1:01:53] compound Redemptive names of God Amen
[1:01:56] there's Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha
[1:01:59] Jehovah Nissi Jehovah Shalom Jehovah
[1:02:03] rayah the Jehovah titsukanu Jehovah
[1:02:06] shama amen these are the seven
[1:02:08] Redemptive names that God revealed
[1:02:11] himself to Israel in the Old Testament
[1:02:15] amen
[1:02:16] now you say now what do all these sevens
[1:02:19] speak of these sevens are representing
[1:02:24] completion now I want you to understand
[1:02:26] because God was fixing to do something
[1:02:29] in these last days through the blood of
[1:02:32] Jesus Christ
[1:02:34] now seven often accompanies the
[1:02:36] Fulfillment of promises
[1:02:39] and I want you to I want you to think
[1:02:41] about this for a moment it says I I I I
[1:02:44] looked up the Hebrew word for seven it
[1:02:49] is Sheba amen the Hebrew word for
[1:02:53] swearing an oath or the promise is
[1:02:57] Shabbat and both of them amen derived
[1:03:02] from the same Hebrew word Saba
[1:03:05] and Saba means satisfaction or fullness
[1:03:11] so now when you look there amen this is
[1:03:15] the fullness of God's completion now
[1:03:18] what church age are we in here tonight
[1:03:21] we're in the seventh we're in the
[1:03:23] seventh the completion of what God is
[1:03:26] doing the Rapture is upon us we are
[1:03:30] getting close to going home amen
[1:03:34] now so seven speaks of the Redemption of
[1:03:39] the Fallen man through Seven Ages it's
[1:03:42] the completion or the finality it's the
[1:03:46] promiseful field or it's rest it is God
[1:03:50] keeping his word bringing band back
[1:03:54] to completion
[1:03:57] now amen uh now it's not important that
[1:04:01] you remember all of that but I just
[1:04:03] think it's interesting as we're dealing
[1:04:05] with the seven Church ages because I'm
[1:04:07] fixing to to to to get into the meat of
[1:04:10] what I'm wanting to say
[1:04:11] amen I I thought it was yeah incredible
[1:04:15] job's accusers sit there for seven days
[1:04:18] accusing or without even saying a word
[1:04:20] to uh to job you know amen and and
[1:04:25] thinking he was a he was a sinner a man
[1:04:28] but job said he was resting in the works
[1:04:32] of his lamb and he offered it daily for
[1:04:35] he and his children is that right
[1:04:37] now they're they're in the Book of
[1:04:40] Revelations now amen there was a lamb
[1:04:43] with seven horns
[1:04:45] a minute so now remember all these
[1:04:47] sevens there was a lamb with seven horns
[1:04:49] the Redemption uh uh through his
[1:04:53] sacrifice amen and and if you were to go
[1:04:57] back in the Old Testament the blood was
[1:05:00] to be sprinkled seven times so they were
[1:05:04] to take according to Leviticus Leviticus
[1:05:07] four and five you can write it down you
[1:05:08] don't have to turn there but it says and
[1:05:10] the priest that is Anointed shall take
[1:05:12] of the Blick's blood bring it to the
[1:05:15] Tabernacle of the congregation and the
[1:05:18] priest shall dip his finger in the blood
[1:05:21] and sprinkle the blood seven times
[1:05:25] before the Lord before the veil of the
[1:05:29] sanctuary
[1:05:30] now seven times they were to take that
[1:05:33] blood
[1:05:34] and he was to
[1:05:36] sprinkle it four seven times amen amen
[1:05:41] then the scripture says Leviticus 16 and
[1:05:44] 14 he shall take the blood of the bullet
[1:05:47] sprinkle it with his finger upon The
[1:05:49] Mercy Seat Eastward before the mercy
[1:05:52] seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with
[1:05:55] his finger how many times
[1:05:58] now why is God doing any anything of
[1:06:01] this importance anything of anything of
[1:06:04] great importance
[1:06:05] it was the mercy seat seven times with
[1:06:08] the blood it was speaking of the Lamb
[1:06:12] that was to come and when John seemed
[1:06:15] the lamb John seen the lamb amen uh with
[1:06:20] with seven horns and seven eyes
[1:06:24] he is speaking of that is speaking of of
[1:06:28] the of the church that is to come
[1:06:32] amen
[1:06:33] so now here we are again
[1:06:36] Hallelujah
[1:06:38] now here's here's the seven Church ages
[1:06:40] here's the seven that's the candlesticks
[1:06:42] it's made of beaten gold
[1:06:44] amen that's that's going to be the
[1:06:46] church now I want us to to to look here
[1:06:50] for for a few moments because as we as
[1:06:54] we go through these studies here in the
[1:06:56] book of uh Revelation I think it's I
[1:06:58] think it's incredible amen how that and
[1:07:01] again 1500 years before Jesus came
[1:07:04] amen there was they were already in type
[1:07:08] sprinkling the blood seven times on The
[1:07:11] Mercy Seat which was a type of Jesus
[1:07:15] shedding his blood for seven Church ages
[1:07:20] it would be Christ's blood that would be
[1:07:24] just as real today as it was the first
[1:07:27] church age
[1:07:29] man
[1:07:30] and so how many how many uh following me
[1:07:33] thus far
[1:07:34] amen now what we just read is Christ has
[1:07:38] seven stars
[1:07:41] in his right hand
[1:07:43] amen now we the the scripture says those
[1:07:47] seven stars were the seven Messengers or
[1:07:49] the seven angels now
[1:07:51] these angels is not Heavenly Angels amen
[1:07:55] the the they're Earthly Messengers you
[1:07:58] see they cannot be Heavenly main uh
[1:08:01] Messengers because Angels don't need
[1:08:04] messages sent to them
[1:08:06] Angels bring the messages to us
[1:08:11] amen now if you look there in in um
[1:08:16] you can you can put it up there first uh
[1:08:19] there in in Revelations one or
[1:08:21] Revelations three and one
[1:08:23] amen and and it it has
[1:08:28] um it says
[1:08:31] um
[1:08:31] or actually uh what we can use that unto
[1:08:35] the angel of the church in Sardis so
[1:08:38] he's not talking to an ER a Heavenly
[1:08:41] Angel he's talking to an Earthly
[1:08:43] messenger
[1:08:45] Amen in fact he says I want you to write
[1:08:47] this and I want you to send it to the
[1:08:50] messengers of the churches in Asia y'all
[1:08:54] understanding that so they're in
[1:08:56] Revelations 2 and 1 unto the angel of
[1:08:59] the Church of Ephesus you cannot send a
[1:09:03] letter to a Heavenly Angel amen is that
[1:09:07] right so it's an Earthly Angel it's an
[1:09:11] Earthly messenger that that is that is
[1:09:14] being sent so he's got seven of these
[1:09:17] Messengers in his hand in his right hand
[1:09:20] is that right
[1:09:22] now I want us to look the Bible says
[1:09:25] there are seven spirits Before the
[1:09:29] Throne
[1:09:30] amen the Bible says there's seven horns
[1:09:34] there's seven eyes
[1:09:36] there's seven stars there's seven lamps
[1:09:40] we're all back into these seven seven
[1:09:42] seven seven seven seven
[1:09:45] all right how many wants to look into
[1:09:47] some of these sevens real quick
[1:09:49] amen now all right let's look here in
[1:09:52] Revelations one and four
[1:09:55] and now we're getting into what I want
[1:09:57] to talk about praise the Lord
[1:10:00] now it says unto the angel or or see uh
[1:10:04] John to the seven churches which are in
[1:10:06] Asia Grace be unto you
[1:10:08] and peace from him which is
[1:10:11] which was which is to come and from what
[1:10:17] the seven spirits which are before his
[1:10:22] throne
[1:10:23] amen so we got seven spirits before he
[1:10:27] has thrown all right let's look at
[1:10:28] another one they're in Revelations 3 and
[1:10:31] 1.
[1:10:37] unto the angel of the church in Sardis
[1:10:40] right these things saith he that hath
[1:10:43] the seven spirits of God
[1:10:46] and the Seven Stars I Know Thy work that
[1:10:50] thou Hast the name that thou livest and
[1:10:53] are dead let's go to Revelations 4 and
[1:10:56] 5.
[1:10:58] foreign
[1:11:05] and out of the throne preceded
[1:11:06] Lightnings and thunderings and voices
[1:11:09] and there were seven lamps of Fire
[1:11:13] burning Before the Throne
[1:11:16] which are the seven spirits
[1:11:19] of God
[1:11:21] all right let's go on over to the fifth
[1:11:23] chapter
[1:11:24] sixth verse
[1:11:27] and I be held and low in the midst of
[1:11:30] the throne and of the four beasts and in
[1:11:32] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[1:11:35] it had been slain having seven horns
[1:11:39] seven eyes which are
[1:11:42] the seven spirits of God
[1:11:46] now
[1:11:49] now that would be interesting now now
[1:11:52] they've got a trinity what are we going
[1:11:54] to do with seven of them amen
[1:11:57] what are we going to do with seven
[1:11:59] so do we now have seven up there no it's
[1:12:04] the same God

[1:13:04] Hallelujah
[1:13:10] all right
[1:13:13] I'm telling you right now I'm putting a
[1:13:15] disclaimer on that okay so we've got
[1:13:18] seven licks of fire we got seven lamps
[1:13:21] what else did we just find that is over
[1:13:23] there
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:25] seven eyes
[1:13:28] so we've got seven eyes
[1:13:39] Hallelujah

[1:14:06] Eat Your Heart Out Haven amen
[1:14:10] okay so now we've got now so we've got
[1:14:14] seven stars
[1:14:16] we've got seven lamps
[1:14:19] we've got seven eyes
[1:14:22] we've got seven horns
[1:14:26] now this and the scripture just said
[1:14:28] amen let's go back over it the seven
[1:14:32] horns
[1:14:33] are the seven spirits that's that's
[1:14:35] Revelations five and six
[1:14:37] amen now brother Branham said the horns
[1:14:41] represent
[1:14:43] the strength of God
[1:14:49] in The Seven Ages the horns are God's
[1:14:53] strength to protect the Lamb's work
[1:14:57] amen that's the strength of the ages
[1:15:00] that's that lamb that is there
[1:15:03] seven eyes the Bible says is the seven
[1:15:07] spirits of God brother Branham says
[1:15:09] these are the seven these are seers
[1:15:16] Prophets
[1:15:20] these are the ones that are bringing
[1:15:22] that are keeping an eye on the church
[1:15:25] bringing the words of life to these
[1:15:28] Seven Ages are you hearing me
[1:15:31] amen now now
[1:15:33] yeah
[1:15:37] yes you can yep yep those are those are
[1:15:40] messengers
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:48] they're seers
[1:15:51] they're prophets they're Messengers amen
[1:15:56] what did the Bible say the seven lamps
[1:15:58] were
[1:16:00] the seven spirits of God so now we've
[1:16:03] got the horns or the seven spirits we've
[1:16:05] got the eyes or the seven spirits which
[1:16:08] brother Branham says is are the prophets
[1:16:10] or the seers then then the Bible says
[1:16:12] the seven lamps Revelations four and
[1:16:15] five are the seven spirits it's all
[1:16:19] going to each
[1:16:21] a amen but it's bringing the lamp what
[1:16:24] was the what was the original brother
[1:16:26] Branham taught us the original fire amen
[1:16:29] that they lit the candlesticks came from
[1:16:32] the Shekinah Glory of God that
[1:16:34] originally started the fire in the
[1:16:36] beginning
[1:16:38] amen it's the same power it's the same
[1:16:40] fire of Holy Ghost the power of
[1:16:44] Pentecost in every one of those churches
[1:16:47] amen it's the revelation of God that has
[1:16:51] been given can you say Amen the original
[1:16:54] Revelation is the only Revelation you
[1:16:59] will ever have
[1:17:01] praise the Lord you don't it's not
[1:17:04] important what I say about it it's not
[1:17:06] important what anyone else says about it
[1:17:08] every one of these Flames all came from
[1:17:13] the original Power of Holy Ghost which
[1:17:16] was the Bible remember the two trees and
[1:17:19] amen you had the two trees here
[1:17:21] praise the Lord and and uh amen that
[1:17:26] they're in in and then the oil came out
[1:17:28] of that remember we've been talking
[1:17:29] about that that's the this is the Old
[1:17:32] Testament
[1:17:33] this here is the New Testament
[1:17:36] amen it's the same it's the word the
[1:17:40] power of the Holy Ghost flowing through
[1:17:42] the word into these seven Church ages
[1:17:45] giving it life giving it strength God
[1:17:49] lives in his word
[1:17:53] amen can you say Amen now we also know
[1:17:56] that the Stars we know that the Stars
[1:17:59] amen are simply the these These are are
[1:18:03] special Stars these stars are messengers
[1:18:09] that are reflecting light from the
[1:18:12] throne
[1:18:17] praise the Lord
[1:18:24] these These are here now brother Branham
[1:18:25] says in their own now these stars are
[1:18:27] special it requires the sunlight of the
[1:18:32] Lamb to shine upon those stars to
[1:18:35] reflect now I I heard someone say the
[1:18:38] other day so well brother Brad I'm just
[1:18:40] totally missed it
[1:18:42] stars stars do not reflect the sun
[1:18:45] science says Stars don't do not reflect
[1:18:48] the sun Hallelujah and and I said well
[1:18:50] that's just about as bad as the guy that
[1:18:52] was saying there's no way that a whale
[1:18:54] can pre uh you know can swallow swallow
[1:18:57] a human being it was a prepared fish and
[1:19:00] these are prepared Stars amen these
[1:19:03] these stars have no light of their own
[1:19:05] and it took a prophet in this day to
[1:19:06] come and say they are reflecting light
[1:19:09] from the throne
[1:19:12] man now are y'all are y'all catching
[1:19:16] that now
[1:19:17] now
[1:19:18] I want you to look that now again uh
[1:19:22] um
[1:19:27] praise the Lord
[1:19:29] now there was there was yeah there's
[1:19:32] okay there I am
[1:19:33] so each one of these are are sent now if
[1:19:37] there if you'll notice Iman
[1:19:40] um
[1:19:41] if you look there in in Revelations 5
[1:19:43] and 6 again you don't have to turn there
[1:19:45] we just we just turned there but
[1:19:47] remember it you know it says I'll be
[1:19:49] held alone the midst of the Throne of
[1:19:50] the four beasts in the midst of the
[1:19:51] elders to the lamb had been slain had
[1:19:53] seven horns seven eyes which are the
[1:19:57] seven spirits of God and I want us to
[1:19:59] all read the last part
[1:20:01] sent forth into all the Earth
[1:20:06] so it's the seven spirits down through
[1:20:08] the periods of time now again the church
[1:20:10] it's it's seven distinct periods of time
[1:20:14] from the time that Christ went up to the
[1:20:18] time that he catches us up amen these
[1:20:21] last two thousand years seven periods of
[1:20:24] time this Spirit seven spirits of God
[1:20:28] have been sent to the earth now some of
[1:20:31] you are asking I am just really confused
[1:20:33] about seven spirits of God it's one God
[1:20:37] reflecting himself or manifesting
[1:20:40] himself to seven different periods of
[1:20:46] time
[1:20:48] there's not seven spirits there's not
[1:20:50] seven gods
[1:21:04] yes
[1:21:08] okay the eyes were identified as Earthly
[1:21:13] Messengers so I and I should probably
[1:21:15] put that on there
[1:21:20] so the stars are Earthly Messengers and
[1:21:23] they that's why we make it clear unto
[1:21:25] the messenger and he and he and he made
[1:21:28] it clear so that we'll understand that
[1:21:29] these are not Heavenly Messengers write
[1:21:33] it and send it to the angel at Ephesus
[1:21:35] send it to the angel of Smyrna send it
[1:21:39] to the angel which is the messenger now
[1:21:42] messenger and it and and it's it's not
[1:21:45] it's it's there it's you
[1:21:48] Angel uh a a Heavenly angel or an
[1:21:52] Earthly Angel which would be an Earthly
[1:21:55] messenger they all come from that same
[1:21:57] word and so uh it wasn't quite it it's
[1:22:01] the when they were writing the King
[1:22:03] James version they just put it all as
[1:22:06] Angel and you have to hey it it you have
[1:22:09] to do a little bit of study uh looking
[1:22:11] at this to see and of course we've got
[1:22:13] the we've got the prophet of the age
[1:22:15] that pointed it out to us that it can't
[1:22:18] be going to a Heavenly Angel because
[1:22:20] first of all amen
[1:22:22] Angels bring Messengers from heaven and
[1:22:25] so amen so here's the difference these
[1:22:29] are Earthly Messengers
[1:22:31] this here is the remember these these
[1:22:34] here are the seven spirits from the
[1:22:37] throne sent to Earth
[1:22:40] so these are Earthly men with with the
[1:22:43] with Prophet God living on the inside
[1:22:47] declaring the words of life to that age
[1:22:51] you understand that
[1:22:53] okay so the seven eyes now remember we
[1:22:56] we just we just uh uh let me go back
[1:22:59] that put that back up uh five and six
[1:23:02] it says having seven horns
[1:23:05] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:23:09] of God sent forth into all the Earth all
[1:23:13] right so these these Stars here again us
[1:23:17] these stars are prepared Stars
[1:23:20] they can't reflect on their own so
[1:23:22] though they are they are born to be
[1:23:24] prophets though they are born to be uh a
[1:23:29] leaders
[1:23:30] until the angel
[1:23:33] comes from the throne one of the seven
[1:23:35] angels from the throne comes down with
[1:23:37] that Revelation they are just as empty
[1:23:39] as empty can be
[1:23:41] so the anointing of that we we
[1:23:44] understand that the eyes is Prophet God
[1:23:46] Amen the eyes of the Lord run to and fro
[1:23:49] all things are naked uh before him whom
[1:23:52] we have to do he knows all things he
[1:23:54] sees all things the Bible says he's
[1:23:56] looking throughout the whole earth
[1:23:58] looking for a heart that is perfect
[1:24:00] towards him so we know that if I'm if if
[1:24:03] I'm the pr if I'm a prophet if I'm born
[1:24:06] to be a prophet to the seventh age
[1:24:09] I have to have amen the spirit coming
[1:24:14] one of the seven spirits coming from the
[1:24:16] throne to enlighten me
[1:24:20] or I'm just as empty as can be I'm a
[1:24:22] star but I've got to reflect the light
[1:24:25] that he brings you you understanding
[1:24:28] that so so rev they have to depend on
[1:24:32] Revelation they had to depend on God to
[1:24:37] give the Revelation to each one of those
[1:24:39] ages or they were nothing
[1:24:47] that's exactly right
[1:24:49] and that's why these that that's why
[1:24:52] they're in his hand
[1:24:56] they're not touched by seminaries
[1:24:58] they're not touched by by mortal
[1:25:01] thinking these men are ordained of God
[1:25:05] for a specific purpose and the spirit of
[1:25:08] God of course we know the strength comes
[1:25:10] from his word we know that that that the
[1:25:13] prophet brother Brandon said over and
[1:25:14] over the Holy Ghost is the prophet the
[1:25:16] Holy Ghost is a prophet so amen and what
[1:25:19] he was trying to say is amen I'm waiting
[1:25:21] on him
[1:25:22] and when he comes oh now I can tell you
[1:25:26] yes you've got this problem that brother
[1:25:28] Brandon would sit there for 20 30 40
[1:25:30] minutes amen just talking and talking
[1:25:33] and at the end they're just waiting what
[1:25:36] was he doing well he was just as
[1:25:38] hopeless and helpless as any mortal man
[1:25:41] until
[1:25:43] then he'd say now I take every Spirit
[1:25:45] under my control
[1:25:48] he was a yielded vessel so he is one he
[1:25:50] is so when you're looking at these amen
[1:25:53] it is now does that answer your question
[1:25:59] yes that is the eyes or is is
[1:26:02] representing Prophet God
[1:26:04] it's the all-knowing god that is that is
[1:26:08] that is being sent to each one of those
[1:26:11] ages and and giving them the Revelation
[1:26:14] uh for their day
[1:26:18] that's that's right it is all now if you
[1:26:21] want to if you want to break it down
[1:26:22] it's it's basically all the same thing
[1:26:25] it's all the seven spirits of God Amen
[1:26:29] but what and I and and and before we go
[1:26:31] uh too much further let me ask you this
[1:26:33] is uh how are you kids handling this
[1:26:37] are y'all all right
[1:26:40] now I went through all the sevens and I
[1:26:42] I didn't want to blow your mind on the
[1:26:44] set but there's a lot and I didn't bring
[1:26:45] all the sevens in from the Old Testament
[1:26:46] neither
[1:26:48] uh uh but there's a but God dealt with
[1:26:51] sevens and the whole purpose for all of
[1:26:54] the sevens
[1:26:56] okay
[1:26:58] Jericho when there's going around
[1:26:59] Jericho they were they were supposed to
[1:27:01] go Jericho seven days one two three four
[1:27:05] five six seven
[1:27:07] on the seventh day they were to go
[1:27:10] seven times
[1:27:14] we've been going for Seven Ages but on
[1:27:17] the seventh on the seventh Church age is
[1:27:20] when the seven Thunders revealed the
[1:27:22] seven angels came down and revealed the
[1:27:25] whole scope of what the Bible has been
[1:27:27] doing
[1:27:28] praise the Lord
[1:27:30] it was a type of what we are today
[1:27:33] y'all catch that so now when you're
[1:27:36] looking at the sevens in the Bible or in
[1:27:38] in the in in the Book of Revelations
[1:27:39] here amen you can see I'm wanting to put
[1:27:42] this in order here that how it all has
[1:27:45] to do with these seven Church ages the
[1:27:49] seven Church Ages was put out there and
[1:27:51] in the in Revelations 1 that the seven
[1:27:54] Church ages amen are is the Candlestick
[1:27:57] represented the churches amen and then
[1:28:00] this is specific Revelation Civic
[1:28:04] anointing specific power to overcome the
[1:28:08] spirits of that age and we're in the
[1:28:11] very last periods of time if you go
[1:28:14] through Revelations 2 and 3 you will see
[1:28:17] that it is it it it it has the whole
[1:28:20] Canon of these last two thousand years
[1:28:22] and these periods of times that that we
[1:28:25] have gone through now now
[1:28:28] I I I want to tell you this is not you
[1:28:31] know it's not a new doctrine there's
[1:28:32] still only one God Amen someone say one
[1:28:35] God
[1:28:37] amen John John uh beginning of John 4
[1:28:41] and 24 it says God is a spirit
[1:28:45] singular amen it doesn't say God is
[1:28:49] seven spirits
[1:28:52] amen God is a a singular spirit is that
[1:28:58] right he can never change
[1:28:59] so now what's going on
[1:29:02] now this is what I've been trying to
[1:29:03] tell you in going through the sonship
[1:29:06] and father because it seems really
[1:29:08] they're saying it's one God and then all
[1:29:09] of a sudden Jesus has got a father and
[1:29:12] everybody no no no God created a body
[1:29:16] and that body was just as helpless as
[1:29:20] your body he says I can do nothing
[1:29:23] except the father for show me my meat is
[1:29:28] to do the will of him that sent me
[1:29:34] but after he died
[1:29:37] for your sins was raised from the dead
[1:29:40] Hallelujah he has been given a name that
[1:29:43] is above every name that at the name of
[1:29:46] Jesus every knee should bow
[1:29:49] is that right it was God in Christ
[1:29:53] reconciling the world to himself
[1:29:57] he says there's one God and one mediator
[1:30:01] between God and man the man Christ Jesus
[1:30:07] Hallelujah
[1:30:08] so it was God in the pillar of fire it
[1:30:10] was God in the burning bush it was God
[1:30:13] in the cloud it was God to Jehovah Jireh
[1:30:16] Jehovah shama Jehovah tits canoe Jehovah
[1:30:20] it's gone and all it's still the same
[1:30:22] God but he's revealing himself in a
[1:30:25] different light to each one
[1:30:28] now I want us to look here for a moment
[1:30:30] because they're in in first Timothy 1
[1:30:33] and 17 and I want I want us to turn
[1:30:36] these next two scriptures for sure uh so
[1:30:39] you kids let me know
[1:30:44] all right any any questions uh make sure
[1:30:47] you're again we're
[1:30:48] we're wide open on Wednesday nights so
[1:30:50] just
[1:30:52] put whatever you want to add to it
[1:30:54] ask questions
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:58] don't wait till after the service to ask
[1:31:00] them because somebody else might really
[1:31:03] some
[1:31:05] all these questions are always asked me
[1:31:06] afterwards I said man I didn't want to
[1:31:08] ask because I didn't want everyone to
[1:31:09] think I was Dumb and I I'm saying well
[1:31:12] the problem is is they're dumb too
[1:31:14] wanting to ask the same question
[1:31:16] amen we all we we're all a little bit
[1:31:18] like that ain't we amen and uh
[1:31:22] and and we'll you know I don't even know
[1:31:24] if I'll have the answer but at least uh
[1:31:26] we'll give it a try anyways huh
[1:31:28] amen so first Timothy are you there
[1:31:31] First Timothy 1 and 17.
[1:31:35] amen and uh
[1:31:38] it says now unto the king eternal
[1:31:43] immortal
[1:31:45] invisible the only wise God
[1:31:50] be honor and Glory forever and ever amen
[1:31:55] so how many gods do we have
[1:31:59] amen if we have more there's only one
[1:32:01] that's wise amen
[1:32:03] all right
[1:32:05] one God hear o Israel
[1:32:08] the Lord thy God is
[1:32:10] one all right let's look here at Jude
[1:32:13] amen
[1:32:15] the Apostle Paul did not preach many
[1:32:18] gods
[1:32:20] and I I hope that I've been helping you
[1:32:22] get to this get get to understand
[1:32:25] that this body
[1:32:27] that God lived in
[1:32:30] that God created was just as helpless
[1:32:32] without
[1:32:33] with without God
[1:32:36] now he was God God lived in that body
[1:32:39] but that body was totally Reliant he was
[1:32:41] 100 God he was 100 human being
[1:32:46] God did not die when Jesus died Jesus
[1:32:49] Paid the price it was a lamb he was that
[1:32:53] was the son that was the lamb well
[1:32:56] praise the Lord there's prophecies about
[1:32:58] there had to be a prophet there had
[1:33:00] there was going to be a a king there's
[1:33:03] going to be a sacrifice that and it that
[1:33:07] had to all be a man now let's look here
[1:33:11] at Jude 1 and 25.
[1:33:13] amen
[1:33:14] to the what
[1:33:17] only wise God
[1:33:20] and his savior
[1:33:22] no
[1:33:24] to the only wise God our savior
[1:33:29] be glory and majesty and dominion and
[1:33:34] power both now and ever
[1:33:37] amen
[1:33:39] all right so let's let's explain it
[1:33:41] let's let's go to First Corinthians 12.
[1:33:45] and then we'll start wrapping it up how
[1:33:47] far how good am I doing
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:52] um okay so it's 8 25. all right so First
[1:33:54] Corinthians 12 and 5.
[1:33:58] and the Apostle Paul is going to explain
[1:34:00] how God works
[1:34:03] amen
[1:34:05] so uh First Corinthians 12 and 5.
[1:34:13] praise the Lord
[1:34:16] amen you'll find it
[1:34:19] amen how are you youngins doing
[1:34:22] it's right after the book of Romans
[1:34:25] praise the Lord
[1:34:27] there are differences
[1:34:29] of Administrations
[1:34:32] but the same Lord
[1:34:34] there are diversities of operations
[1:34:38] but it is the same God which worketh all
[1:34:43] in all to save time let's go down to the
[1:34:46] eighth verse 4 to 1 is given by the
[1:34:49] spirit the word of wisdom
[1:34:51] to another the word of knowledge by The
[1:34:54] Same Spirit
[1:34:55] to another Faith by The Same Spirit
[1:34:59] to another Gifts of healing bye
[1:35:04] The Same Spirit to another working of
[1:35:07] Miracles to another prophecy to another
[1:35:08] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[1:35:10] kinds of tongues to another
[1:35:12] interpretation of tongues but all these
[1:35:15] worketh that
[1:35:18] all these workers that
[1:35:23] all these work is that seven
[1:35:27] that nine
[1:35:30] that one self same
[1:35:34] spirit
[1:35:35] dividing to every man severally as he
[1:35:37] will can you say Amen so when we're
[1:35:40] looking here it's the diversity it's one
[1:35:43] God coming in seven manifestations if
[1:35:49] you were to see if you if I had my
[1:35:51] chalkboard up here a little bit more
[1:35:53] it's all the same God
[1:35:56] the same logos that is that is coming
[1:36:00] and reflecting himself to each one of
[1:36:04] these ages
[1:36:06] the same God
[1:36:08] not seven spirits
[1:36:12] one spirit
[1:36:14] seven manifestations
[1:36:17] one God three offices
[1:36:22] that's the reason why they said in in
[1:36:24] Isaiah 9 and 6. amen and you can put
[1:36:27] that up there sister Keys uh you kids
[1:36:30] could probably quote that we do that in
[1:36:32] our in in our quiz every every year amen
[1:36:35] unto us a child someone say child
[1:36:40] this is the sonship this is Christ this
[1:36:43] is Jesus born in a manger
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:47] a child is born a son is given the
[1:36:51] government shall be upon his shoulders
[1:36:52] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:36:55] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[1:37:00] father
[1:37:04] come on I just wish these theologians
[1:37:06] that's writing Bibles would just get it
[1:37:09] right he's a son
[1:37:11] if he's the son how can he be the
[1:37:13] Everlasting father
[1:37:15] you're messing things up
[1:37:18] no
[1:37:19] the Everlasting father created the body
[1:37:24] and moved inside the body
[1:37:27] so when Jesus says when you have seen me
[1:37:31] you've seen the father
[1:37:37] amen
[1:37:39] Hallelujah but the reason for the body
[1:37:42] to be born in the first place
[1:37:45] was to die
[1:37:48] but more than just die it was to show
[1:37:50] you the relationship that God wanted to
[1:37:53] have with man
[1:37:55] and when you get to the other side
[1:37:59] there's going to be a man sitting up on
[1:38:01] the throne
[1:38:02] it'll be a man God it'll be the man
[1:38:04] Jesus Christ it'll be the only God the
[1:38:07] only Savior Jesus Christ
[1:38:09] he's going to have a body like yours
[1:38:13] and not like these not a sinful body not
[1:38:15] a not uh no no no no no no you're going
[1:38:17] to be changed to be like him
[1:38:20] but you're going to have eyes like a man
[1:38:22] God's got eyes like a man God's got Ears
[1:38:24] Like a Man God's got hands like a man
[1:38:27] the invisible God
[1:38:30] looks like a man
[1:38:34] he loved you so much
[1:38:37] that he become you
[1:38:39] so that you could become him
[1:38:44] do you love him
[1:38:46] yeah
[1:38:48] no let me show you just one last thing
[1:38:50] here that I I think is is good so now
[1:38:52] we've got so we've got the seven horns
[1:38:55] which are the seven spirits
[1:38:57] amen
[1:38:58] which is the strength of the church not
[1:39:00] by power not by might but by my spirit
[1:39:03] saith the Lord
[1:39:05] you've got seven eyes which are the
[1:39:07] seven spirits which is Prophet God
[1:39:11] coming down and Discerning the age that
[1:39:14] they're living in
[1:39:15] amen he brought me raised up Martin
[1:39:18] Luther
[1:39:19] as as the Reformation to stand up and
[1:39:23] and to stand up against it how did the
[1:39:26] Roman Catholic church had put everyone
[1:39:29] uh any kind of person for 1500 years put
[1:39:32] them put them to death that would rise
[1:39:34] up against him how did he do it because
[1:39:36] there was a horn
[1:39:37] standing right up there was an anointing
[1:39:39] that was sent to Earth in the glory of
[1:39:41] the Lord all right
[1:39:47] what is it
[1:39:51] Sears
[1:39:52] well a Seer is a prophet let's let's
[1:39:56] let's look here
[1:39:58] let's look here in the book of Hebrews
[1:40:03] and this is what I should have showed
[1:40:04] you a while ago
[1:40:06] this year's would be a better
[1:40:08] explanation it's scriptural
[1:40:13] now Hebrews
[1:40:14] um
[1:40:16] let's see we're Hebrews 4 and
[1:40:24] 12. now y'all remember when we first
[1:40:26] started this
[1:40:28] um some some weeks back I told you and
[1:40:31] the reason why we we titled this this
[1:40:33] mysterious one who is this mysterious
[1:40:35] one walking in the midst of the
[1:40:36] candlesticks it's the logos of God Amen
[1:40:40] that was the word now it was an
[1:40:42] invisible God but when God spoke then
[1:40:44] the light comes so the first light was
[1:40:46] not the sunlight the first light was the
[1:40:49] pillar of fire and from that Pillar of
[1:40:51] Fire is where everything else came from
[1:40:53] so the Eternal thoughts of God that was
[1:40:55] in his mind amen from all eternity God
[1:40:58] does not have a new thought amen God's
[1:41:00] God's got that but when he spoke then
[1:41:04] here come the what the what the
[1:41:05] theologians call the logos that's that
[1:41:07] Pillar of Fire
[1:41:09] amen God is now living inside that
[1:41:12] Pillar of Fire
[1:41:13] is the fire to come to Moses demon spoke
[1:41:16] out of the burning bush it was the fire
[1:41:18] that led the children of Israel it was
[1:41:19] the fire that came down and licked up
[1:41:21] the sacrifice to Elijah of Elijah it was
[1:41:24] the it was the pillar of fire that came
[1:41:25] down and visited our Prophet it was it
[1:41:27] was that Pillar of Fire it was God can
[1:41:29] you say Amen now
[1:41:32] it's the logos is that Living Word so
[1:41:35] it's not like a word here on this page
[1:41:37] it's a Living Word it's a word when you
[1:41:41] in the beginning was the logos not the
[1:41:44] word on a page
[1:41:47] The Living Word it was when God spoke
[1:41:50] Hallelujah before we start that let's
[1:41:52] let's look here at let's just go up to
[1:41:54] Revel or to uh while we're here in in
[1:41:57] Hebrews 4
[1:41:59] and where are we at four and
[1:42:03] well before we go there let's go up for
[1:42:05] a minute
[1:42:06] the third verse is which we we which
[1:42:09] have believed you enter into rest as he
[1:42:11] saith as I have sworn in my wrath they
[1:42:14] shall enter into my rest although the
[1:42:17] works were finished from the foundation
[1:42:21] of the world The Works were finished his
[1:42:24] word was already spoke can you say Amen
[1:42:27] now and if you go one down and and it
[1:42:30] says
[1:42:32] amen and it's the whole thing is all
[1:42:35] talking about the word being preached
[1:42:37] amen and and he's talking about that
[1:42:40] rest and he's talking about how that you
[1:42:42] know he says uh the second verse for
[1:42:45] unto us was the Gospel preached as well
[1:42:46] as unto them but the word preached was
[1:42:49] not did not profit them not being mixed
[1:42:51] with faith but we which have believed do
[1:42:53] enter into rest as he have sworn as he
[1:42:56] said out sworn in my wrath they shall
[1:42:58] enter my rest although the works were
[1:42:59] already finished from the foundation of
[1:43:01] the world now now then he goes on down
[1:43:03] to the
[1:43:05] um
[1:43:06] he's talking about believing and
[1:43:08] disbelieving the 11th verse let us labor
[1:43:11] therefore to enter into that rest lest
[1:43:12] ye any man fall after the same example
[1:43:15] of unbelief for the word of God is quick
[1:43:19] powerful it's that word quick is living
[1:43:22] it's living and Powerful sharper than
[1:43:25] any two-edged sword Piercy even to the
[1:43:28] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit
[1:43:31] joints tomorrow is a discerner of
[1:43:34] thoughts and intents of a heart neither
[1:43:37] is there any creature that has not
[1:43:39] manifest in his sight
[1:43:41] in a word you know there's nothing that
[1:43:43] you can hide from him but all things are
[1:43:45] naked and open unto the what
[1:43:49] eyes of him
[1:43:52] with whom we have to do so this word
[1:43:55] this logos
[1:43:57] is the amen it's the all-knowing eyes of
[1:44:01] God
[1:44:02] God knows everything about you girls he
[1:44:06] knows everything about you boys he knows
[1:44:08] everything he knows everything done in
[1:44:09] secret
[1:44:10] he knows everything there is not there
[1:44:12] is not
[1:44:13] a little gnat
[1:44:16] that bats his eye that God doesn't see
[1:44:18] it and God doesn't know it God knows all
[1:44:22] things his eyes see all things there is
[1:44:25] nothing hidden from God that's God
[1:44:30] Angels can't do that
[1:44:31] no angels can do that Angels don't don't
[1:44:34] they're not like that God and God Alone
[1:44:37] is all knowing again again though it was
[1:44:41] it's not a new thought God is eternal
[1:44:43] it's hard to put that in our mind but
[1:44:45] God is God God has seen this
[1:44:48] he's known it from eons and eons and
[1:44:51] eons before time all right
[1:44:54] the eye of God he's he's all-knowing
[1:44:58] these eyes
[1:45:01] when God would come down then he would
[1:45:03] anoint
[1:45:05] The Seer
[1:45:07] or he would anoint the messenger
[1:45:10] and that is how the Apostle Paul
[1:45:14] could could tell you that that's how he
[1:45:16] could be a prophet that is that is how
[1:45:19] our messenger could become a prophet
[1:45:22] Anointed with those eyes
[1:45:25] to see to be able to tell you what you
[1:45:28] think what you where where you live to
[1:45:31] tell you he knows all about you not the
[1:45:35] Mortal messenger
[1:45:38] but the eyes of the Lord
[1:45:41] does that make sense
[1:45:43] amen hallelujah how about how about you
[1:45:46] other kids anyone else anyone else have
[1:45:49] any anything any questions anything you
[1:45:50] want to add
[1:45:52] praise the Lord
[1:45:54] amen
[1:45:56] now little Lydia
[1:45:57] all right
[1:45:59] so
[1:46:01] now I want to talk about these
[1:46:02] Messengers uh for just give me give me
[1:46:04] five more minutes here and and um
[1:46:07] the same one God coming forth in a
[1:46:10] seven-fold manner now we read there in
[1:46:14] in Revelations uh four and five that the
[1:46:17] seven lamps of fire burning Before the
[1:46:20] Throne are the seven spirits of God now
[1:46:24] John used nothing but Old Testament
[1:46:27] symbols so John anything that he used in
[1:46:30] The Book of Revelations you can find in
[1:46:32] the Old Testament
[1:46:34] whether it be lamps whether it be
[1:46:36] candlesticks all of all of those symbols
[1:46:40] you can find in the Old Testament time a
[1:46:43] lot of them you can find in the Book of
[1:46:45] Daniel
[1:46:45] but now
[1:46:47] uh uh but but I want us to look here on
[1:46:51] on this on this the spirit amen the the
[1:46:54] burning fire they're in Proverbs 20 and
[1:46:57] 27
[1:47:00] the spirit of man is the candle of the
[1:47:06] Lord
[1:47:07] searching all the inward parts
[1:47:09] of the belly so now he is connecting he
[1:47:13] is connecting these Eternal flames
[1:47:16] to some to um to men here on the earth
[1:47:20] that God was going to anoint
[1:47:22] amen you look there in John 5 and 34
[1:47:25] talking about John the Baptist the Bible
[1:47:27] says he was a burning
[1:47:30] and Shining Light
[1:47:33] amen and you were willing for a season
[1:47:35] to Rejoice with them
[1:47:37] now so these Messengers that God that
[1:47:42] God used
[1:47:43] let's just turn real quickly and then
[1:47:46] and the musicians can get prepared to
[1:47:48] come I'm that I'm going to use one last
[1:47:50] scripture here and I I want to go to
[1:47:52] Zechariah
[1:47:54] we've we've looked at this a time or two
[1:47:59] Zachariah is a hard one to find
[1:48:06] if you can find Zachariah you boys are
[1:48:08] doing good you kids
[1:48:10] man are you there
[1:48:15] they beat me Hallelujah
[1:48:18] this is this is awesome amen
[1:48:22] okay
[1:48:23] so Zechariah 4 and 10 it says for who
[1:48:27] hath despised the day of small things
[1:48:30] for they somebody say they
[1:48:33] shall rejoice and shall see the plummet
[1:48:36] in the hand of zerubbabel with those
[1:48:39] seven
[1:48:40] they are the eyes of the Lord so we're
[1:48:43] going hmm all right let's see what those
[1:48:46] seven are amen let's go up to the second
[1:48:48] verse
[1:48:49] to the second and he said unto me what
[1:48:52] seeth thou and I said
[1:48:54] I have looked and behold a Candlestick
[1:48:56] all of gold with a bowl on the top of it
[1:48:59] and his seven lamps there on and seven
[1:49:02] pipes to the seven lamps which are up on
[1:49:06] the top thereof and two olive trees buy
[1:49:10] it one up on the right side of the bow
[1:49:12] the other up on the left side thereof so
[1:49:14] I answered and spoke to the angel that
[1:49:16] talked to me saying what are these my
[1:49:19] Lord let's go on down to the eighth
[1:49:20] verse moreover the word of the Lord came
[1:49:22] unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel
[1:49:26] have laid the foundation of this house
[1:49:27] his hands shall also finish it and thou
[1:49:31] shalt know that the Lord of hosts had
[1:49:32] sent me unto you
[1:49:34] for who hath despised the day of small
[1:49:36] things for they shall rejoice and they
[1:49:40] and shall see the plummet in the hands
[1:49:42] of zerubbabel with those seven they are
[1:49:45] the eyes of the Lord
[1:49:47] which run to and fro throughout the
[1:49:50] whole earth then answered I and said
[1:49:52] unto him what are these to all of trees
[1:49:55] on the right side of the Candlestick and
[1:49:57] on the left side
[1:49:59] and I answered and said or he uh
[1:50:03] and I answered again and said unto him
[1:50:05] what be the olive branches
[1:50:08] with which through the two golden pipes
[1:50:11] empty the the golden oil out of
[1:50:13] themselves and he said unto me know us
[1:50:15] thou not and I said uh no my Lord and he
[1:50:19] said these are the two anointed ones
[1:50:21] that stand by the lord of the earth so
[1:50:24] here's your two trees these are the two
[1:50:26] anointed ones here's your new testament
[1:50:28] here's your Old Testament and the pipes
[1:50:31] came in and this is what the anointing
[1:50:33] of oil came giving the light through
[1:50:36] that church ages amen so so y'all
[1:50:39] understand amen so when he's saying the
[1:50:42] eyes of the Lord these seven these seven
