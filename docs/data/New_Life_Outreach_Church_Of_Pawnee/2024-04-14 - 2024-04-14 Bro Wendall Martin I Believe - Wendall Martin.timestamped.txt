[39:34] amen amen amen and
[39:37] amen if you have your scriptures let's
[39:40] look here in Titus the first
[39:43] chapter and um it is so good to see
[39:49] everyone uh in the house of worship this
[39:53] morning and um uh tonight we're going to
[39:58] be having um our our communion service
[40:01] it's been a it's been a little while and
[40:04] so we're going to be having a communion
[40:06] here this evening and then um um we uh
[40:14] while we've I think brother William will
[40:15] be back by then and so most of us will
[40:18] all be here for communion and and um I'm
[40:23] I'm looking forward to
[40:25] that um Titus 1 and
[40:29] N holding fast the faithful word as he
[40:32] hath been taught that he may be able by
[40:36] sound Doctrine both to exhort and to
[40:38] convince the naysayers The Gangs
[40:41] Sayers for there are many unruly and
[40:44] vain talkers and
[40:46] deceivers especially they of the
[40:49] circumcision whose mouths Must Be
[40:52] Stopped who subvert whole houses
[40:56] teaching things things which they ought
[40:58] not for filthy lucer
[41:01] Sake One of themselves even a prophet of
[41:05] their own said the Christians are always
[41:07] liars and evil beasts and slow
[41:11] bellies this witness is true wherefore
[41:14] rebuke them sharply that they may be
[41:17] sound in the faith not giving heed to
[41:20] Jewish
[41:22] fables and Commandments of men that turn
[41:25] from the truth
[41:27] unto the pure all things are pure unto
[41:31] them that are defiled and unbelieving is
[41:33] nothing pure but even their mind and
[41:36] conscience is
[41:38] defiled they profess that they know God
[41:40] but in Works they deny him being
[41:44] abominable and
[41:46] disobedient and unto every good work
[41:50] repeate now that's quite a reading isn't
[41:53] it I'd also like to look here in the
[41:56] book of Hebrew Hebrews the 13th or the
[41:59] 12th
[42:03] chapter and we're just going to read the
[42:07] first two
[42:09] verses wherefore seeing we also are
[42:12] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[42:16] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[42:18] and the sin which does so easily beset
[42:21] us let us run with patience the race
[42:24] that is set before us looking at to
[42:27] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[42:30] faith who for the joy that was set
[42:32] before him endured the cross despising
[42:36] the shame and is sat down at the right
[42:40] hand of the Throne of God Amen God bless
[42:44] you you can be seated here this
[42:48] morning we are looking at two groups
[42:53] here if you were to go back and look at
[42:56] the Hebrews the 11th
[42:58] chapter you would see
[43:01] that these great cloud of witnesses were
[43:05] amen uh were all here in the uh were
[43:10] some of them were mentioned right here
[43:12] in the Hall of Fame right here in
[43:15] Hebrews the 11th chapter amen who had to
[43:19] fight who had to persevere who had to
[43:24] walk by faith amen because it it was a
[43:27] total walk by faith and most had to walk
[43:31] alone but as we read the first verse or
[43:35] the first reading there in the book of
[43:38] Titus man we we seen that the gospel was
[43:44] birthed in in in in the midst of
[43:49] apostasy you see the
[43:52] the this was the changing between law in
[43:57] Grace this was going to be the this was
[44:00] the time to where the law had come to
[44:03] its end and the grace was now fixing now
[44:09] beginning for Christ was the end of the
[44:12] law and he was the beginning of
[44:16] Grace and so but yet in the when Jesus
[44:20] came Jesus came in the midst of of major
[44:27] apostasy amen it was satanic forces were
[44:31] doing everything from spting lies to
[44:35] beating the uh Saints and imprisoning
[44:39] and even killing the followers of Jesus
[44:42] Christ and and and so we can we can see
[44:46] as we parallel where we are today as
[44:50] this is a this is the ending of the
[44:54] Gentile
[44:55] dispensation amen where the Grace has
[44:58] come and we know that the Rapture is
[45:01] upon us and we are amen things are now
[45:06] turning from the Gentiles and going back
[45:09] to the Jews amen so as we could see what
[45:13] God took what what happened at the at
[45:17] the changing of the old into Grace we
[45:21] can now see that it is the changing of
[45:23] the Gentiles and going back to the Jews
[45:27] and there must be a faith in order to
[45:29] see this now this is nothing new this
[45:33] type of Doubt has has been around amen
[45:36] Since U since the world began God's word
[45:39] has always been doubted by Satan and his
[45:42] children God's God's word cannot be
[45:45] accepted amen by by by Lucifer and he
[45:49] teaches others the prophet says he
[45:52] teaches others to doubt that word just
[45:56] as he doubts that word amen and so we
[46:00] can see how that amen uh uh the angels
[46:05] of uh uh uh Lucifer has transformed him
[46:09] into the angel of Light amen there the
[46:13] you you talk about the hardness of our
[46:15] age and and and you you look there in 1
[46:18] Timothy uh 4 and 1 and it says now the
[46:21] spirit speaketh expressly that in the
[46:23] latter times some shall depart from the
[46:26] faith giving heed to seducing spirits
[46:29] and doctrines of devils speaking lies in
[46:32] hypocrisy and having their conscience
[46:35] seared with a hot iron Amen in other
[46:39] words their their heart would become so
[46:42] hardened to the truth of the Gospel
[46:46] until they themselves would become the
[46:50] vessels amen of Darkness can you say
[46:53] amen and brother Bron would talk about
[46:55] the the hardness of this age and he says
[46:58] you've got to keep your your heart
[47:02] bathed with the tears amen of the Gospel
[47:06] you have got to bathe your heart in
[47:08] other words there's got to be repentance
[47:11] within our hearts there's got to be a
[47:13] cry Lord I want to be what you want me
[47:16] to be I want to be everything that
[47:19] you've ordained for me to be can you say
[47:23] man amen in the bomb of Gilead brother
[47:25] Bron would say the number one killer
[47:26] isn't heart's disease in the world today
[47:29] as we are told the number one killer is
[47:31] sin disease it's a disease of sin that
[47:35] is killing the world now amen for a for
[47:39] a title here this morning I'm just going
[47:41] to use two words I
[47:45] believe amen won't you turn to your
[47:47] neighbor and say I believe amen that's
[47:51] right now uh there in Proverbs 21 and2
[47:55] it says every way of a man is right in
[47:58] his own eyes but the Lord pth the hearts
[48:02] now I want us to look there for just a
[48:04] moment at the condition of this age
[48:06] because amen the condition of the age is
[48:09] a hardening of the heart it is
[48:11] consciences that has been seared in
[48:13] other words there there is a numbness
[48:15] that begins to transform amen the being
[48:18] of a person to where amen they're not
[48:21] able to think and they're not able to to
[48:24] look at the word and and apply that word
[48:27] to their life because they have become
[48:30] hard-hearted amen and it's incapable of
[48:33] being moved to pity or to tenderness or
[48:35] the unfeeling or callous or unconcern
[48:39] brother Brandon would put it this way he
[48:41] said you might as well admit that that
[48:44] this anglosaxon people is finished
[48:47] that's all there's no more gospel the
[48:49] that America will receive amen you might
[48:52] get a few straggling now and then but
[48:54] just as the gospel it is over you can't
[48:57] even preach to them you can't talk to
[49:00] them they won't believe nothing see they
[49:02] got their own hardheaded ideas and
[49:06] they're set and the thing the next
[49:08] things for this judge this nation is
[49:10] Judgment she's going to have it too it
[49:13] may be through depression it may be
[49:15] through atomic bomb it may be through
[49:17] Great Plague a disease or something but
[49:19] she is ready it's coming thousands times
[49:22] thousands will fall we've passed by
[49:25] yesterday brother Z and brother Woods
[49:28] coming in uh from down in Kentucky where
[49:30] we had been 3 days and passed by a
[49:32] housing project and brother zel said I
[49:35] he says there's not hardly any of those
[49:38] people in that project that even goes to
[49:40] any church you would ask them about it
[49:42] and we'll we'll get our television and
[49:44] that's how we find Comfort that's the
[49:46] American attitude we've got television
[49:49] we've got plenty of money we got Fine
[49:51] Cars we got nice homes we what do we
[49:54] need the Lord we don't need that that's
[49:56] the attitude about the only religion and
[49:59] salvation we have and love is among the
[50:01] real godly people you know the Bible
[50:04] said that would happen uhhuh you Bible
[50:07] readers amen I heard you hollering amen
[50:10] and you preachers back there and that's
[50:12] right the love would be so far away in
[50:15] the last days that only the elect would
[50:18] be left would be uh uh the only love
[50:22] would be left would be between the elect
[50:24] of God's people the father would be
[50:26] against mother mother against father
[50:27] children against parents different ones
[50:30] against each other the only love would
[50:33] be left would just be the elect just the
[50:36] elected the word elect comes from
[50:40] elected God's elected people can you say
[50:43] Amen so now we are seeing here that
[50:46] there is the day that is approaching now
[50:49] we're living in it the day was
[50:51] prophesied that would come to where the
[50:54] Hearts would be very callous and the
[50:57] only ones that would God would be able
[51:00] to even halfway penetrate would be his
[51:04] elect that's the only ones that's going
[51:07] to be able amen and they say family you
[51:10] know father against mother and mother
[51:12] against father and this that and the
[51:13] other because everyone is looking after
[51:17] their own ways instead of the ways of
[51:19] God can I hear an amen but yet faith has
[51:23] a very solid foundation amen as we begin
[51:26] to as we look this morning God says when
[51:30] everything else is shaking and he did
[51:33] say I'm going to shake the heavens I'm
[51:35] going to shake the Earth and all that
[51:37] can be shaken will be shaken everyone
[51:41] that can be shaken that has not got
[51:44] their their their foundations in the
[51:48] word of God can be shaken and they will
[51:51] be shaken amen well praise the Lord amen
[51:55] but the Apostle Peter would say in 2
[51:57] Peter 1:16 for we have not followed the
[52:03] cunningly devised fables when we made
[52:06] known unto you the power and coming of
[52:09] our Lord Jesus Christ but were I
[52:12] Witnesses of his majesty amen so what
[52:15] he's trying to say now amen they may not
[52:19] understand they may not uh uh you know
[52:23] they may be fighting the word they may
[52:25] be wrapped up in a apostasy but I want
[52:27] to tell you the reality of Jesus Christ
[52:30] is here the realities that I have
[52:32] declared is real and you have not
[52:35] followed fun uh cunningly fables can you
[52:39] say amen amen and I want to say here
[52:41] this morning when Satan is there to come
[52:45] against this church there is a
[52:49] foundation and that Foundation is the
[52:52] revelation of the word of God in this
[52:54] day amen if there's a young man man or a
[52:56] young woman that needs a a a a
[52:58] foundation amen you've got to have the
[53:01] foundation of the word of God it's got
[53:04] to be the foundation of your thoughts
[53:06] it's got to be the foundation of your
[53:07] belief it's got to be the foundation of
[53:09] your opinions it's got to be the
[53:10] foundation of everything you are because
[53:14] the word is the only thing that will
[53:17] last can I hear a great big
[53:21] amen now so faith is a must amen You
[53:25] Must Believe God and you must never
[53:28] question now before Adam partook of the
[53:31] tree of knowledge it was Faith they
[53:34] simply believed what God Said Amen now
[53:40] Satan come in and said this will make
[53:43] you
[53:44] wise and to know as God knows amen and
[53:48] so Faith was traded for wisdom Faith was
[53:51] traded for understanding from then on
[53:54] everything had to be proved in order to
[53:57] believe and since then we have amen as
[54:01] mankind even God's children uh uh we we
[54:06] we have all been trained Amen to follow
[54:09] what we see smell taste touch and hear
[54:11] we we've been taught to Amen to uh uh
[54:16] what what we see here on the tree of
[54:18] knowledge is what God or is what we are
[54:22] tangible what we can uh uh what we cling
[54:25] to what we what we can prove what we can
[54:28] feel what we can know what amen because
[54:31] now everything is around us it's the
[54:34] tree of death it's the tree of it's the
[54:36] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen
[54:39] and the unregenerate will never know God
[54:41] because amen you cannot know God after
[54:44] the carnal mind you'll never know God
[54:46] after the natural flesh you you cannot
[54:49] even please God in this flesh right here
[54:53] can I hear an amen you cannot do that so
[54:56] you you have to be born again and when
[54:58] you are born again there is a faith that
[55:02] opens up amen your soul begins to see
[55:06] things on a totally different level it's
[55:08] a level that is not known to the church
[55:11] member it's a level that's not known to
[55:13] amen uh the the average preacher it's a
[55:16] member amen it's it's a it's a level
[55:19] that is not known to many many many
[55:21] message folks it is a level amen that
[55:24] sees things the way God sees things
[55:27] understands things the way God
[55:29] understands things and you can believe
[55:32] God and you become a Mystic to this
[55:35] world Amen now your faith you're not
[55:38] looking at this and this and this you
[55:41] don't have your calculator 1 + 1 equals
[55:44] 2 you're walking with God by Divine
[55:47] Faith you're walking with God you're
[55:50] fulfilling his word you're living your
[55:53] purpose because the Holy Spirit is
[55:56] living and abiding within
[55:59] you can you say amen amen the
[56:03] unregenerate will never know God because
[56:07] they will question scrutinize and doubt
[56:10] God's word every time why because his
[56:15] system is built from birth around amen
[56:20] the tree of
[56:22] knowledge everything is all wrapped
[56:25] around that tree of knowledge well
[56:28] praise the Lord Brother Merl mentioned
[56:30] this morning this old flesh amen is not
[56:33] is not the it's not the real thing this
[56:35] ain't the perfect will here amen and God
[56:38] but God is calling you through the Holy
[56:42] Spirit and through that soul to believe
[56:44] him and walk with him and fellowship
[56:46] with him so that his character can be
[56:49] revealed through your flesh revealed
[56:54] what you see in here what you see here
[56:58] is manifested in your talk manifested in
[57:01] your walk manifested in everything you
[57:04] do it's a different a different set of
[57:10] rules the evil
[57:13] spirits have been prophesied to be so
[57:17] persistent till the elect would be
[57:20] deceived if God hadn't put his own
[57:23] DNA in your soul
[57:26] am you would be deceived in this state
[57:30] of
[57:31] apostasy and
[57:33] selfishness and and can and and Canon F
[57:38] if you had not had the DNA of God within
[57:43] your heart well I I I just want to say
[57:46] here right now how is it that we can sit
[57:48] here this morning and believe God how is
[57:51] it in the land of Chaos in the land of
[57:54] apostasy in the land of of Amen of sin
[57:59] and death and amen it's it's a it's
[58:03] every man for
[58:04] himself how is it that we could come off
[58:08] the tree of knowledge and start
[58:11] partaking of the tree of life it's only
[58:14] because God has called our hearts it's
[58:18] only because God has placed his seed on
[58:22] the inside of you and given you the
[58:25] ability
[58:26] to hear his word given you the ability
[58:31] Hallelujah now I'm going to preach my
[58:32] message here this morning amen I I I'm
[58:35] going to preach praise the Lord but John
[58:38] 9 6 and44 says no man can come to me

[59:12] raise him up at the last days it is
[59:15] written in the prophets they shall all
[59:19] somebody say hallelujah hallelujah amen
[59:22] now the scripture going back to the
[59:24] scripture that we would be deceived amen

[59:37] elect will hear from God amen
[59:42] hallelujah amen now watch this and they
[59:45] there in 45th verse and they shall be

[1:05:54] you boys you're going to have to believe
[1:05:55] God you're going in order to be leaders
[1:05:57] you're going to have to be able to
[1:05:58] believe God you're going to have to walk
[1:06:00] with God in order to stand against the
[1:06:02] tide of the enemy of leosia we've got to
[1:06:07] walk with
[1:06:12] God if there's any one of you that's
[1:06:14] ever going to succeed if you teenage
[1:06:15] girls here if you're planning to succeed
[1:06:17] you're going to have to walk with
[1:06:21] God M and daddies you're going to have
[1:06:23] to walk with God

[1:06:27] rain though it can't be proved amen that
[1:06:31] there's ever even been a
[1:06:36] clown and though you've
[1:06:39] been claiming this for over a hundred
[1:06:42] years
[1:06:43] now you're going to have to
[1:06:46] walk with
[1:06:48] god did it happen of course it happened
[1:06:51] Faith paid
[1:06:52] out no one done what he was and I led if
[1:06:56] you were to go back I don't have it here
[1:06:57] but if you were to go back in Hebrews 11
[1:07:00] and look at all the action words that
[1:07:03] are all part of a man he prepared an ark
[1:07:07] he believed he went through all of those
[1:07:09] things now Faith is going to be
[1:07:13] tried and so
[1:07:15] I as we talk as we ministered last week
[1:07:21] on
[1:07:23] character and what it takes and the tri
[1:07:25] trying of your faith here in Hebrews or
[1:07:28] or 1 Peter
[1:07:31] 1:7 he says that the trying the trial of
[1:07:34] your faith being much more precious than
[1:07:37] of gold that perisheth though it be
[1:07:40] tried with fire might be found under
[1:07:44] praise and honor and Glory at the
[1:07:48] appearing of Jesus Christ now the faith
[1:07:53] is what God gave you but then then now
[1:07:55] comes to the new birth that's what takes
[1:07:57] place when you are born again but then
[1:08:00] the faith has got to be
[1:08:04] tried sometimes we go through the trials
[1:08:06] sometimes we don't understand the trials
[1:08:08] and we everyone have to go through our
[1:08:10] trials
[1:08:11] hallelujah amen if we could we don't
[1:08:14] want to give a testimony to the devil
[1:08:16] amen but I'm sure we could all go we
[1:08:18] could all go back and and tell you
[1:08:20] stories of our trials and our things
[1:08:21] that we have gone through amen as
[1:08:23] Believers since we have become
[1:08:25] Christians Christianity is not amen is
[1:08:27] is not easy living Christ that Easy
[1:08:29] Living has nothing to do with
[1:08:30] Christianity our Easy Living is on the
[1:08:32] other side amen what we're here to do is
[1:08:35] to come and to proclaim the Gospel of
[1:08:37] Jesus Christ and to live that gospel
[1:08:39] with everything that was within us every
[1:08:41] ounce that is in our body every breaking
[1:08:43] moment everything that we have is Jesus
[1:08:46] Christ and he tries us and he puts us to
[1:08:48] the test and he and he and sometimes it
[1:08:50] seems like we're going to break and
[1:08:52] sometimes it seems like we can't go any
[1:08:54] further but God knows what what he's
[1:08:55] doing and he wants to see his reflection
[1:08:58] in you he wants to see his glory in you
[1:09:01] and the only way that that can take
[1:09:02] place is through the test and the
[1:09:06] trial Hallelujah in the midst of it all
[1:09:09] Ephesians
[1:09:11] 6:16 above
[1:09:13] all somebody say Above All Above All
[1:09:17] taking the shield of
[1:09:18] Faith wherewith ye shall be able to
[1:09:23] quench at least half come
[1:09:26] on wherewith you shall be able to
[1:09:29] quench
[1:09:31] most come on above
[1:09:34] all I don't care whether you have got
[1:09:37] the sword of the spirit I don't care
[1:09:39] whether you have got amen you have got
[1:09:42] to have that Faith to build your
[1:09:43] foundation but you have also got to keep
[1:09:45] that Faith as your shield and because
[1:09:47] the scripture says that you are going to
[1:09:50] be able to withstand all the fiery darts
[1:09:54] of the wicked one that are fighting your
[1:09:56] soul you're not going through your mind
[1:09:59] you've got another filter you're not
[1:10:01] filtering through amen this or that you
[1:10:03] have got another filter it's the word of
[1:10:05] God it's the faith in that word what are
[1:10:08] you doing you are standing when the
[1:10:10] enemy is amen is striking you are
[1:10:13] standing when the powers of hell are oh
[1:10:15] come on church amen what it looks like
[1:10:18] amen all hell is against you when it
[1:10:20] looks like amen Satan is Ping you young
[1:10:23] minds amen this way and that way you
[1:10:27] keep that Shield of Faith it's God that
[1:10:30] called you it's God that's going to
[1:10:32] finish you it's God that said I'll never
[1:10:34] leave you I'll never forsake you never
[1:10:37] let your faith
[1:10:40] waver
[1:10:41] Hallelujah you are his
[1:10:45] purpose can you say
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:49] amen it's faith in that
[1:10:52] word when I said when I chose I believe
[1:10:56] this
[1:10:58] morning I say that
[1:11:02] because
[1:11:04] everything of the
[1:11:10] scripture everything that we see
[1:11:13] here was for men that was
[1:11:16] willing to
[1:11:19] die for this
[1:11:22] word
[1:11:24] now think about that acts 7:51 it says
[1:11:28] ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart
[1:11:30] and ears you do always resist the Holy
[1:11:33] Ghost as your fathers did so do
[1:11:35] you which of the prophets have your
[1:11:37] fathers not
[1:11:40] persecuted and they have slain them and
[1:11:42] showed which showed before the coming of
[1:11:44] the just one of whom ye have now the
[1:11:47] betrayers and
[1:11:49] murderers Isaiah was killed by the
[1:11:53] authorities Elijah was sought to be
[1:11:56] killed by the queen right Daniel was
[1:12:00] condemned to the Lion's
[1:12:03] Den amen under the decree of
[1:12:06] law Jeremiah Was condemned and
[1:12:09] imprisoned by law he was attacked by his
[1:12:12] own Brothers beaten and put in stock
[1:12:15] amen a as uh uh by a priest and and a
[1:12:20] false prophet he was thrown into a
[1:12:22] sister by the officials of Judah
[1:12:25] and later on stoned to
[1:12:27] death Ezekiel was stoned to death Micah
[1:12:30] was killed by King Gerome Amos was
[1:12:33] tortured by amziah the priest and killed
[1:12:35] by the priest's son what what am I
[1:12:38] saying is
[1:12:41] everything that we hold
[1:12:44] dear has been fought by the
[1:12:50] enemy
[1:12:52] everything that that we
[1:12:56] hold as a treasure of our heart Satan
[1:12:59] has tried to
[1:13:01] kill can you say
[1:13:03] amen amen there's been a cloud of
[1:13:06] mysticism over the
[1:13:08] church amen there is a mystical
[1:13:11] component to the church it's
[1:13:14] unexplainable it's a mystery it's it's
[1:13:17] beyond human
[1:13:19] understanding the church is the Apostle
[1:13:23] Paul says the church is a great
[1:13:27] mystery Satan wants to
[1:13:32] destroy not just simply you but he's
[1:13:35] trying to get to the word that you
[1:13:40] possess because we know that in this
[1:13:43] final day now the prophets they were
[1:13:45] carriers of the word now that word was
[1:13:47] not for them that word was for a future
[1:13:51] generation that word was for you and me
[1:13:53] so the prophet Satan was trying to kill
[1:13:56] those prophets to shut up the word to
[1:14:00] keep that word from reaching you because
[1:14:03] the word would be believed in seed form
[1:14:05] and would take flesh in you in this last
[1:14:08] generation they tried to kill the
[1:14:11] prophets they they they tried to kill
[1:14:13] the word when they killed the prophets
[1:14:15] so that they could destroy Jesus Christ
[1:14:18] they couldn't destroy him they they they
[1:14:20] killed Isaiah but the word lived cuz the
[1:14:22] word of God is eternal amen you can kill
[1:14:25] the messenger but you can't kill the
[1:14:26] word you can you can destroy the body
[1:14:28] but you cannot destroy the faith can you
[1:14:31] say Amen so these men were carriers of
[1:14:35] that light they were Gods the prophet of
[1:14:37] Amen Malachi 4 said amen he says they
[1:14:40] were gods to the people until the word
[1:14:44] left them once they expressed it then
[1:14:46] they just become the ordinary Isaiah or
[1:14:49] ordinary uh uh you know Moses amen but
[1:14:52] they had Moses had to keep that Veil
[1:14:54] over his face until he come and declared
[1:14:56] the word and then the glory of the Lord
[1:14:59] would leave him oh glory to God but
[1:15:03] there was going to come a time where the
[1:15:04] glory was no longer just going to come
[1:15:06] upon Moses face to leave again Isaiah to
[1:15:09] leave again amen Malachi to leave again
[1:15:13] there would come one where the pillar of
[1:15:15] fire would rest upon his name would be
[1:15:19] Jesus Christ and I love it because what
[1:15:22] God told John was the one that you see
[1:15:25] the the light come upon and remain he is
[1:15:31] the just one the one that you see see
[1:15:36] there's a reason why the word had to
[1:15:37] come there's a reason why Satan has
[1:15:39] tried to kill amen and Satan is going to
[1:15:41] come and kill the Prince of Life but
[1:15:44] they don't realize that when they killed
[1:15:46] Jesus Christ in him are all the genetics
[1:15:50] of God in him is wend Martin is Josh
[1:15:53] Martin Amen in in him is Kaye in him
[1:15:56] amen is every one of us here is in
[1:16:05] Christ how many's ever stomped on a
[1:16:07] spider that was
[1:16:12] pregnant and when they killed
[1:16:15] Jesus that was the wrong thing to
[1:16:18] do he was
[1:16:20] pregnant in him was God's Eternal genes
[1:16:23] in him come on chch church and now it's
[1:16:26] no longer a prophet that is willing to
[1:16:28] go to the Grave it's no longer amen just
[1:16:31] a just just a one one of these great men
[1:16:33] that the Holy Ghost would fall on
[1:16:35] occasionally now it is God's Eternal
[1:16:38] genetics living in bodies in human
[1:16:40] beings we're living like God we're
[1:16:42] believing like God we're acting like God
[1:16:45] we're thinking like God Amen we're
[1:16:47] praying like God we are casting Devils
[1:16:49] out like God we're doing all of those
[1:16:52] things why because the genetics of God
[1:16:54] are with in me I cannot lie I cannot
[1:16:58] receive a lie I re I believe the
[1:17:02] word that's who I am in the beginning
[1:17:06] was the word I was in him
[1:17:11] Hallelujah hell glory to
[1:17:13] God Amen
[1:17:16] now but
[1:17:19] see there was no proof brother Joe have
[1:17:22] you ever thought how
[1:17:25] it would have been
[1:17:26] nice that if Jesus would have went to
[1:17:29] caifas the high
[1:17:31] priest and say hey
[1:17:33] dude it didn't
[1:17:37] work here I am you killed
[1:17:41] me Jonas had already declared this Amos
[1:17:46] had already declared it the third day
[1:17:49] here I am hello nice try now
[1:17:56] and then go to appear to his you see
[1:17:59] Jesus did not appear to any of those
[1:18:04] guys Jesus could have went and just made
[1:18:06] things so much easier on the rest of
[1:18:09] us we we wouldn't we wouldn't have to
[1:18:11] worry about a thing all we'd have to do
[1:18:13] is just say hey proofs in the pudding
[1:18:17] the documents are there they seen him
[1:18:20] right but he didn't appear come on he
[1:18:24] appeared to his
[1:18:25] disciples the ones that believed
[1:18:28] him he's not going to appear oh Church
[1:18:31] of God on in a day of
[1:18:35] hardness in a day of rock
[1:18:39] Hearts don't let your heart become so
[1:18:44] callous that you can't experience God in
[1:18:48] the light that he wants you to
[1:18:50] experience him in can you say Amen you
[1:18:54] see you see it is it is it is it is
[1:18:57] these pleasure seeking people that are
[1:19:02] pushing Christ out but I want to tell
[1:19:05] you everyone the pillar of fire fell on
[1:19:07] were willing to give their lives in
[1:19:11] death what they done why did christ fall
[1:19:14] on them is because they were elected by
[1:19:16] God they were birthed for a season he
[1:19:18] told he told what uh Jeremiah he says I
[1:19:22] have I have separated you I I've called
[1:19:25] you he was only 5 years old amen and he
[1:19:28] says I've called you and ordained you
[1:19:30] separated you from your mother's womb to
[1:19:32] be a prophet to the Nations to pull down
[1:19:35] and to build up I've called you for that
[1:19:38] God built that man to
[1:19:44] believe no one else could believe
[1:19:47] it but he believed it he was
[1:19:50] designed I hope y'all's catching my
[1:19:52] message this morning he was
[1:19:55] designed to
[1:19:59] believe those Hebrews Jesus walking
[1:20:02] around amen and they were all saying
[1:20:03] you're the you're the prince of the
[1:20:05] devil you are the devil you're this and
[1:20:06] you're that and you're born from a
[1:20:08] illegitimate birth you're this and
[1:20:09] you're that amen and they're all
[1:20:11] criticizing and when Jesus just walks by
[1:20:14] when Jesus just walks by and says follow
[1:20:17] me and Peter dropped his Nets Peter
[1:20:20] dropped his Nets left him right there
[1:20:24] right there on the seashore and followed
[1:20:27] Christ why because there was something
[1:20:30] within him that was built to believe
[1:20:34] there was something oh Church of the
[1:20:36] Living God when the devil's trying to
[1:20:38] tell you you can't you won't and you
[1:20:39] never will be why don't you tell him
[1:20:42] then why can't I believe what is in my
[1:20:44] heart say I want to please God I want to
[1:20:47] be with God I want him to reflect his
[1:20:50] life in me tell me how that happens
[1:20:52] devil
[1:20:56] come on Church come on Amen the enemy
[1:20:59] the enem is there amen he didn't appear
[1:21:01] to his critics he appeared to those that
[1:21:04] were predestinated by God to eternal
[1:21:10] life
[1:21:11] man Matthew 28:11 this is the kind of
[1:21:14] guys that the 12 apostles in the first
[1:21:17] church had to put up with this is what
[1:21:19] they were
[1:21:20] doing it says now in the 11th
[1:21:23] verse now when when they were going
[1:21:25] behold some of the watch came into the
[1:21:28] City and showed unto the chief priest
[1:21:31] all the things that were
[1:21:32] done and when they were assembled with
[1:21:35] the elders and had taken counsel they
[1:21:38] gave large
[1:21:40] money unto the soldiers saying say ye
[1:21:44] his disciples came by night and stole
[1:21:47] him away while we
[1:21:49] slept and if this come to the governor's
[1:21:52] ears we will persuade him and secure you
[1:21:54] so they took the money did as they were
[1:21:58] taught and this saying is commonly
[1:22:01] reported among the
[1:22:03] Jews until this
[1:22:06] day now Matthew wrote this years
[1:22:13] later well praise the
[1:22:16] Lord but if you have been taught you say
[1:22:20] you say now now brother Wendell I I I I
[1:22:24] I I I I I don't know what did I just
[1:22:28] read to you a while ago John 6 and44 no
[1:22:31] man can come to me except the Father
[1:22:33] which you sent me draw him and I will
[1:22:36] raise him up at the last day it is
[1:22:38] written they shall be all taught of God
[1:22:44] every man therefore that hath heard and
[1:22:48] hath learned of the
[1:22:50] father comes to me can you say Amen acts
[1:22:56] 13:48 and when the Gentiles heard this
[1:22:58] they were glad and glorified the word of
[1:23:00] the Lord and as many as were ordained to
[1:23:04] eternal life questioned and asked we
[1:23:08] need a little more
[1:23:10] proof questioned and ask are you sure
[1:23:13] about this can I can do you have any
[1:23:15] Witnesses amen besides those among you
[1:23:17] this is sort of weird you guys are all
[1:23:19] collaborating together but we want to
[1:23:21] hear somebody besides your little group
[1:23:23] as many as were ordained to eternal life
[1:23:28] be lived come on church and if you've
[1:23:31] been ordained well praise the Lord and
[1:23:34] the word of the Lord was published
[1:23:36] throughout all the region but the Jews
[1:23:38] stirred up The Devout and honorable
[1:23:41] women and the chief men of the city and
[1:23:43] raised persecution against Paul and
[1:23:45] Barnabas and expelled them out of their
[1:23:47] Coast but they shook off the dust of
[1:23:49] their feet against them and came into
[1:23:52] Iconium and the disciples were filled
[1:23:55] with joy and with the Holy Ghost the
[1:23:58] more the trial the more we're going to
[1:24:00] praise the more Satan comes against us
[1:24:03] the more we're going to persevere the
[1:24:05] more Satan says you can't God says you
[1:24:08] will because my eternal Jean seat is on
[1:24:12] the inside of me oh come on Church
[1:24:15] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:24:17] that is in the world stand the test and
[1:24:20] stand with the
[1:24:22] word right
[1:24:24] H can you say
[1:24:27] Amen now the vast majority did not
[1:24:30] believe so it's not just in hearing
[1:24:33] because remember there in in in in
[1:24:36] Isaiah 53 And1 who hath believed our
[1:24:39] report and to whom is the arm of the
[1:24:42] Lord
[1:24:43] revealed man there Romans 10 and 14 Paul
[1:24:47] would pick it up and he would say then
[1:24:49] how shall They Call On Him whom they
[1:24:51] have not believed and how shall they
[1:24:53] believe in him of whom they have not
[1:24:54] heard and how shall they hear without a
[1:24:58] preacher and how and how shall they
[1:25:01] preach except they be sent as it is
[1:25:03] written how beautiful are the feet of
[1:25:04] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[1:25:06] bring Glad Tidings of good things but
[1:25:09] have they not all uh but they have not
[1:25:12] all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah sayth
[1:25:15] Lord who ha believed our report so then
[1:25:18] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:25:20] the word of the Lord but I say have not
[1:25:23] they not heard yes verily their sound
[1:25:27] went into all the earth and the words
[1:25:30] unto the end of the
[1:25:32] world but the
[1:25:36] elect will be taught here therefore you
[1:25:39] can receive it
[1:25:41] here if it's not taught
[1:25:44] here amen you'll have to take your
[1:25:47] calculator around everywhere you go
[1:25:50] calculators are not important in God's
[1:25:52] world God's Got a Way
[1:25:55] God's moving in your life you don't need
[1:25:59] calculators what we've got to do is open
[1:26:01] up our hearts to him and say
[1:26:06] Lord many have
[1:26:10] heard but it's a
[1:26:12] Bible plus a human being a human being
[1:26:17] and their
[1:26:20] Bible but the Apostle Paul is not
[1:26:23] wanting that
[1:26:24] he is saying you're not to just hear it
[1:26:28] but it's to become part of
[1:26:32] you you think like the word you act like
[1:26:36] the word you you persist like the word
[1:26:40] the enemy comes against you because you
[1:26:43] are the
[1:26:45] word the enemy hates you because you are
[1:26:50] the threat to Satan's
[1:26:52] kingdom Satan comes against you because
[1:26:56] you are the Holy Ghost to your
[1:27:00] children you are the conductor you it's
[1:27:03] no longer it's no longer God the Bible
[1:27:06] and a prophet it is God the Bible in me
[1:27:12] affecting my family affecting those
[1:27:14] around me affecting why it is God living
[1:27:19] in
[1:27:21] me yes sir can you say Amen
[1:27:26] now I think this is
[1:27:29] incredible all that the Father John
[1:27:34] 637 all that the father giveth me shall
[1:27:36] come to me and him that cometh to me I
[1:27:39] will no wise cast out John 6:39 all and
[1:27:44] this is the Father's will that all will
[1:27:46] which hath sent me that all which he
[1:27:49] hath given me I shall lose nothing but
[1:27:52] should raise it up at the last day today
[1:27:55] can you say Amen now I I want to just
[1:28:00] drop this in here I know I'm a little
[1:28:01] slow this morning but I I I want to put
[1:28:06] this in here why you
[1:28:10] believe if you're and and again I know
[1:28:13] some of this is a little on the
[1:28:15] elementary side I'm just following the
[1:28:19] long along the lines from last week on
[1:28:22] that predestination
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:25] remember uh um um matter of fact you can
[1:28:28] put that up there sister uh I think it's
[1:28:31] uh Romans 9 and 10 or uh it may be the
[1:28:35] 11th verse the children not doing good
[1:28:37] or bad uh uh for the children being not
[1:28:42] yet born neither having done any good or
[1:28:46] evil that the purpose according to
[1:28:48] election might stand not of works but of
[1:28:51] him that calleth let's just read a
[1:28:54] couple verses on down sis and it was
[1:28:57] said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:29:00] younger as it is written Jacob have I
[1:29:02] loved but Esau have I hated now I want
[1:29:04] you to catch all that now because it
[1:29:07] because that that's that's that
[1:29:09] scripture is doing something that's the
[1:29:12] reason you're able to be who you are
[1:29:15] what shall we say then is uh did I miss
[1:29:18] something or we still on it is there any
[1:29:19] unrighteousness with God God
[1:29:22] forbid for he saith to Moses I will have
[1:29:25] mercy on whom I will have mercy I will
[1:29:27] have compassion on whom I will have
[1:29:29] compassion so then it is not of him that
[1:29:32] willth nor of him that runneth but of
[1:29:34] God that shows
[1:29:37] Mercy amen for the scripture sath unto
[1:29:40] Pharaoh even for this same purpose have
[1:29:42] I raised thee up that I may show my
[1:29:45] power in thee that my name might be
[1:29:47] declared throughout all the Earth how
[1:29:49] many would like to be Pharaoh
[1:29:51] Hallelujah Pharaoh okay I've ra raised
[1:29:54] you up too Hallelujah to show what a
[1:29:56] bonehead is to show you how you can
[1:29:59] resist the word of God Amen but I and my
[1:30:03] word will win every time amen let's
[1:30:07] let's go ahead and finish it up there
[1:30:08] therefore he hath Mercy on whom he will
[1:30:11] have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth
[1:30:15] amen so so and that will say then let's
[1:30:18] just keep me going long we're in that
[1:30:20] same line let tell you what let me just
[1:30:22] get the scripture here that way I I know
[1:30:24] where I'm at amen Romans 9 praise the
[1:30:27] Lord you love
[1:30:29] him amen now so Romans 9 and
[1:30:34] 19 this is this is so good so there 18th
[1:30:37] verse therefore he ha Mercy on whom he
[1:30:39] will have mercy and whom he will he
[1:30:40] hardeneth thou wil say then unto me why
[1:30:42] do he yet find fault for who hath
[1:30:44] resisted his will but nay oh man who art
[1:30:48] thou that replies against God shall the
[1:30:50] thing form say to him that formed it why
[1:30:52] hast Thou made me thus hath not the a
[1:30:54] Potter power over the clay of the same
[1:30:55] lump to make one vessel unto honor and
[1:30:58] another unto dishonor what if God
[1:31:00] willing to show his wrath to make his
[1:31:02] power known endured with much
[1:31:04] longsuffering the vessels of Wrath
[1:31:05] fitted to destruction that he here we go
[1:31:09] that he might make known The Riches of
[1:31:12] his glory on the vessels of Mercy which
[1:31:16] he had before prepared unto Glory even
[1:31:22] us someone Shout
[1:31:24] Hallelujah even us who is who Heath
[1:31:28] called not of the Jews only but also of
[1:31:32] the
[1:31:33] Gentiles so the trials Pharaoh was
[1:31:37] raised see sometimes we're looking at
[1:31:39] our trials in our situations and we're
[1:31:41] thinking God I don't understand why you
[1:31:43] know maybe it's on the job or maybe
[1:31:45] maybe you're just in a big a big trial
[1:31:47] they've got to come our way they've got
[1:31:51] to come our way this is the way God
[1:31:54] expresses himself is through you've got
[1:31:57] to have a test in order to have a
[1:32:03] testimony well glory to God see now the
[1:32:07] children of Israel were scared of
[1:32:09] pharaoh and God says I have raised
[1:32:11] Pharaoh up so that I could declare who
[1:32:13] the children of Israel
[1:32:15] were yes sir I've raised Pharaoh up I've
[1:32:20] hardened his heart is that what the
[1:32:22] scripture says he hardened his heart did
[1:32:26] the prophet say that we're living in a
[1:32:27] day of callous
[1:32:30] Hearts yes
[1:32:32] sir but in the midst of it
[1:32:36] all there is
[1:32:39] light Hallelujah now the enemy can Vex
[1:32:43] your souls the enemy can do whatever
[1:32:44] that the enemy amen your mind is is is
[1:32:47] not is not totally redeemed yet your
[1:32:50] body is not totally redeemed yet but
[1:32:52] your soul is and so so with our souls we
[1:32:56] overcome the evil one now not going to
[1:32:59] hold you too much longer looking at the
[1:33:01] Middle East and and and that war that is
[1:33:04] going on the church world is all in arms
[1:33:08] about Israel right now you're seeing
[1:33:11] that in in you're seeing that everywhere
[1:33:13] you're uh you know all man the it's it's
[1:33:15] all over the place uh they're all
[1:33:18] talking about Israel amen and and uh oh
[1:33:22] sign of the time is getting close we're
[1:33:25] getting
[1:33:27] close now this is the same church that
[1:33:30] kicked the word and his bride
[1:33:32] out of their churches now this is the
[1:33:35] same this is the same ones that have
[1:33:37] kicked the word out kicked the bride out
[1:33:40] and now here they are oh the coming of
[1:33:42] the Lord is so
[1:33:45] soon and I got to tell you that the
[1:33:47] Middle East is not the sign of the
[1:33:49] coming of the Lord Putin is not the sign
[1:33:51] of the coming of the lord it's not the
[1:33:53] sign to get ready Iran is not the sign
[1:33:55] to get ready and Israel itself though
[1:33:57] Israel we watch Israel because we know
[1:34:00] that the that this that that when when
[1:34:03] when God leaves the Gentiles that there
[1:34:06] is going to is going to Israel we know
[1:34:10] that but they are not the signed to the
[1:34:13] to the elect you've been given a favor
[1:34:15] to know because you have the sense to
[1:34:19] believe you've got the ability to know
[1:34:22] the scripture says so he gives his word
[1:34:25] not to leaders not to dictators but to
[1:34:29] prophets crus chefs not a assigned to
[1:34:32] the world no sir Hitler wasn't assigned
[1:34:34] to the world but somewhere someplace
[1:34:37] God's got a humble Prophet waiting for
[1:34:39] the hour he is the sign then he says
[1:34:43] he's the sign that will condemn the
[1:34:46] world and will save the church that's
[1:34:48] the
[1:34:48] prophet
[1:34:50] see they're looking over here and
[1:34:53] they're wait and here we've been given
[1:34:57] the
[1:34:58] sign the word
[1:35:00] sign we've been given the word we can
[1:35:04] take everything back and line it up with
[1:35:08] the
[1:35:10] word if you can't if you can't line your
[1:35:12] attitudes up with the word then there's
[1:35:15] plenty of blood if you can't line what
[1:35:17] you walk looking at on the phone with
[1:35:18] the word then there's plenty of blood if
[1:35:20] there's if there's amen if you can't
[1:35:22] line what you have with the word the
[1:35:25] Vindicated word of the hour then we have
[1:35:28] got to come back am I making any sense
[1:35:30] here this morning you've got to come
[1:35:32] back to that word and you've got to know
[1:35:35] amen this is what the Apostle Paul amen
[1:35:37] told his his uh his elected Church uh or
[1:35:42] here here's here's another one God
[1:35:43] hiding himself in Simplicity he says
[1:35:45] brother Bram says the Rapture will come
[1:35:46] in such a simple way till the judgments
[1:35:48] will fall they'll see the son of man and
[1:35:50] say wasn't we supposed to have such and
[1:35:52] such wasn't there supposed to any lias
[1:35:54] sent to us wasn't there supposed to be a
[1:35:55] Rapture and Jesus said amen it's already
[1:35:58] happened uh Jesus will say it's already
[1:36:00] happened and you didn't know it God in
[1:36:03] Simplicity can you say Amen could you
[1:36:06] imagine the the Apostle Paul there in 1
[1:36:08] Thessalonians 5:1 and says but the times
[1:36:10] and the seasons Brethren you have you
[1:36:12] have no need that I write unto you for
[1:36:14] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[1:36:16] of the Lord comes as a thief in the
[1:36:17] night for when they say peace and safety
[1:36:20] then sudden destruction shall uh cometh
[1:36:23] upon them as travail upon a woman with
[1:36:25] child and and they shall not Escape ye
[1:36:28] Brethren are not in darkness someone
[1:36:30] shout hallelujah that that day should
[1:36:33] overtake you as a thief ye are all the
[1:36:35] children of light and the children of
[1:36:37] the day we are not of the night nor of
[1:36:39] the darkness therefore let us not
[1:36:43] sleep as do others but
[1:36:47] watch and be sober for they that sleep
[1:36:50] sleep in the night and they that be
[1:36:52] drunken are drunken in the night but let
[1:36:53] us who are of the day be sober putting
[1:36:55] on the breastplate of faith and love for
[1:36:57] in helmet the hope of
[1:37:01] Salvation
[1:37:04] Amen in a day
[1:37:07] where many are walking away from this
[1:37:10] blessed truth that we
[1:37:11] know and they're going after
[1:37:13] sensationalism and they're going after
[1:37:15] this that and the
[1:37:16] other
[1:37:19] I as I was in
[1:37:22] prayer this
[1:37:25] week and
[1:37:29] looking at at as we are uh preparing you
[1:37:33] know to minister
[1:37:35] today I thought
[1:37:39] Lord no matter which
[1:37:42] way the world
[1:37:46] goes it is so good to have a
[1:37:49] nucleus it's so good to be
[1:37:53] to be energized to the great
[1:37:57] magnet the great magnet is
[1:38:00] Christ and we're all the little
[1:38:03] pieces that have been magnetized to
[1:38:09] him so wherever he is we
[1:38:13] are
[1:38:17] now brother bradam says the time is
[1:38:19] slowly coming where the door is closing
[1:38:22] the doors almost most
[1:38:25] closed he says the reason and you can
[1:38:28] see this he said the
[1:38:32] reason that there's nothing that moves
[1:38:34] the people the Holy Spirit just does not
[1:38:36] convict
[1:38:37] anymore is
[1:38:39] because the door is
[1:38:42] closing those things aren't there
[1:38:45] anymore he said now they still they're
[1:38:47] still going to come to an altar they're
[1:38:49] still going to have big crowds they're
[1:38:50] still going he says he says the truth of
[1:38:52] the matter is when the Rapture takes
[1:38:54] place they'll still be flocking to
[1:38:57] altars because the magnet is not the
[1:39:03] word here in this hour when the door is
[1:39:07] closing and you say well Revival's
[1:39:10] over well it's the
[1:39:12] reason where he
[1:39:15] is you
[1:39:17] are that's what the Rapture is they're
[1:39:21] waiting for God to come down and do some
[1:39:23] kind of voodoo and we've already been
[1:39:26] lifted up our
[1:39:28] soul has taken on the
[1:39:31] word we're thinking like the word we're
[1:39:34] behaving like the word we're we're we're
[1:39:38] living like the word what are we doing
[1:39:41] we're asking God for his grace Upon Our
[1:39:45] Lives what are we doing he's pulling us
[1:39:49] and pulling us now you see me here but
[1:39:53] I'm not living in this
[1:39:55] world I'm I'm I I've got more of a
[1:39:58] desire than I've ever had to be like
[1:40:01] Jesus you're living in this
[1:40:05] world and and you might be getting more
[1:40:07] round and it might look like this it's
[1:40:10] it's getting more impossible for you to
[1:40:12] lose gravity
[1:40:15] amen but I I I I I'm just here to tell
[1:40:18] you the gravity that's got to be left
[1:40:20] behind is in that soul
[1:40:23] because the soul the body's the body's
[1:40:25] got to be changed the spirit's got to be
[1:40:27] changed it's the soul that God is
[1:40:30] looking at Lord I'm going to watch that
[1:40:34] heart with everything that I've
[1:40:37] got I want that heart to be so in tune
[1:40:41] and so in love you girls hear me so in
[1:40:46] love with Jesus in his word you boys
[1:40:49] hear me so in love that's we sing and
[1:40:54] the musicians can come falling in
[1:40:56] love with
[1:40:59] Jesus Falling In
[1:41:01] Love With
[1:41:05] Jesus Falling In
[1:41:08] Love With
[1:41:11] Jesus was the best thing I've
[1:41:16] ever you can go
[1:41:19] ahead in your arms
[1:41:22] [Music]
[1:41:25] I feel
[1:41:28] protected in your

[1:44:01] prayer and it shouldn't be because oh
[1:44:04] look at Israel oh my we got to hurry it
[1:44:06] should be because the prophet has
[1:44:08] brought us a message and told us the
[1:44:11] Vindicated
[1:44:14] signs we've had wars and rumors of wars
[1:44:17] and it's looking bad but you see the
[1:44:19] bride has already made herself ready and
[1:44:22] if we use with we use those signs of
[1:44:24] wars and things we may be left behind
[1:44:28] someday so what we want to do is we want
[1:44:30] to say Lord here I
[1:44:32] am make me pliable
[1:44:34] today and I don't care whether you're
[1:44:36] 100 years old here

[1:44:43] heart I don't care if you're just a
[1:44:47] teenager only
[1:44:50] heart you just remember in all of the
[1:44:52] facts of life in all of everything that
[1:44:56] is going on today you young men hear
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:04] me thing we could ever do is fall in
[1:45:06] love with
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:10] Jesus I know we might like our
[1:45:14] girls you girls
[1:45:17] might think boys are attractive but the
[1:45:20] greatest thing you could ever do
[1:45:25] you say you keep holding your hand like
[1:45:27] that and I I keep wanting to get to it
[1:45:29] but I I keep thinking other things
[1:45:31] too brother random says
[1:45:34] that
[1:45:37] heart has been made to hold the golden
[1:45:40] oil of divine
[1:45:45] love he as if it's ever been broken it
[1:45:49] it'll heal but there will always be a
[1:45:50] scar
[1:45:55] and that's why I
[1:45:57] say it's the reason I am always
[1:46:01] preaching at you
[1:46:03] young if you can learn from
[1:46:06] me and if I
[1:46:08] can teach you that the greatest thing
[1:46:10] that you could ever do is to love
[1:46:12] him the greatest thing you could ever do
[1:46:15] is to entertain him when he's
[1:46:19] near when his presence is in our church
[1:46:21] service not not to just sat on a
[1:46:26] Pew like a knot on a
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:31] log but the woman that knew she needed
[1:46:35] Jesus she pressed through
[1:46:38] everything she didn't care what anyone
[1:46:40] else
[1:46:42] thought she had to get to him and touch
[1:46:46] him blind bmus when he knew he was near
[1:46:50] he had heard the crowds but when the
[1:46:52] little girl him says oh that's
[1:46:54] Jesus he said is that the one that my
[1:46:57] mother told me
[1:46:59] about mother told me that he would be
[1:47:02] coming and he started screaming
[1:47:05] Jesus
[1:47:06] Jesus when Jesus
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:15] becomes when Jesus
[1:47:18] becomes our every
[1:47:21] desire when Jesus becomes
[1:47:24] our
[1:47:27] every fiber of our
[1:47:30] being we're not worried
[1:47:32] about you you you kids ain't worried
[1:47:34] about what the adults are doing in the
[1:47:35] back or what this one's doing or that
[1:47:37] doing you're you're going to scream out
[1:47:39] you know he's here and you know you need
[1:47:40] him
[1:47:41] and Jesus Jesus
[1:47:48] Jesus does this good for us Elders to do
[1:47:51] that too occasionally
[1:47:54] why we got to keep that oil brother Josh
[1:47:59] preached the other night on that that
[1:48:01] that that bottle that made of skin it
[1:48:05] can't hold the fermenting power
[1:48:09] of of new
[1:48:11] wine it'll bust it can't hold it because
[1:48:15] the old skin is not
[1:48:16] oil it's it's it's
[1:48:19] brittle it'll crack
[1:48:23] it can't it can't expand with the love
[1:48:25] of God it can't expand with the presence
[1:48:27] of God it's just rigid
[1:48:31] it's but I'm here to tell
[1:48:35] you you're predestinated to
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:45] this I don't know I was watching we I
[1:48:49] went out to go play with the boys the
[1:48:50] other night over there at there going to
[1:48:52] go play basketball and so
[1:48:55] I I went out over
[1:48:59] there and they found something else for
[1:49:01] me to do take take one of the kids home
[1:49:04] and said you you go do that and well it
[1:49:07] didn't happen quite like that
[1:49:09] but
[1:49:11] and but when I got back there was a
[1:49:14] native over there
[1:49:17] and he was he was as Saed
[1:49:20] as could be
[1:49:23] and he was falling around in that Court
[1:49:25] as those guys were all playing and these
[1:49:26] guys they were just they were going at
[1:49:27] it he was going he how how was he doing
[1:49:32] that he was going
[1:49:36] around hollering at him y'all got this
[1:49:38] y'all got this so finally they gave him
[1:49:40] the ball and I thought he was a
[1:49:42] basketball player I
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:45] mean it went toward the vicinity of the
[1:49:49] barn but not close to the goal
[1:49:55] and I looked at
[1:49:57] that
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:06] man just watching him in his eagerness
[1:50:08] just want to play and be a part of the
[1:50:18] guys and it just like I went back I went
[1:50:21] flashback I went all the way
[1:50:24] back to when I first came to
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:35] Pony I'd take every drunk that I could
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:41] find and I would tell him you can
[1:50:44] belong you can
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:50] belong I baptized
[1:50:53] [Music]
[1:50:56] so many of them in the name of the
[1:50:59] Lord as I'm sitting there watching that
[1:51:01] man said oh
[1:51:03] [Music]
[1:51:08] God I
[1:51:10] need I need
[1:51:13] something to get my heart back soft and
[1:51:17] pliable
[1:51:19] again where I can bleed
[1:51:22] for the
[1:51:24] hurting I can live for the
[1:51:28] Fallen I can
[1:51:34] give I got a phone call
[1:51:37] and and so I walked out on on the other
[1:51:42] about just right over here around the
[1:51:44] shed
[1:51:45] there and uh well everyone was through
[1:51:48] playing and so we got in and it was me
[1:51:51] Josh and brother Michael in the
[1:51:55] car and I seen the guy
[1:51:58] walking walking through here going back
[1:52:00] over here at a yellow
[1:52:03] horse and I thought you
[1:52:06] know I have been
[1:52:10] rejected I have been made fun
[1:52:12] [Music]
[1:52:17] of the years that I put in back in those
[1:52:20] days
[1:52:24] but I
[1:52:28] thought those were some of the best
[1:52:30] times of Miracles and some of the best
[1:52:32] times of the
[1:52:35] supernatural
[1:52:36] leading those ones to the Lord
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:42] Jesus sort of weird sort of weird but I
[1:52:46] as I was going back I thought
[1:52:49] God surely there's more now we combed
[1:52:54] the
[1:52:55] town when I came into the
[1:52:57] message I combed the town you you kids
[1:53:00] probably remember when we'd go door to
[1:53:02] door knocking
[1:53:04] and
[1:53:07] we but that generation is is getting
[1:53:11] older there's a new generation that has
[1:53:12] come up they've got to hear the
[1:53:17] gospel there's kids that don't even know
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:25] and my thoughts
[1:53:26] were does anyone want what I've got
[1:53:31] really is there anyone that really wants
[1:53:34] what I
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:38] got and then it just comes just as clear
[1:53:41] as can be the elect
[1:53:46] does the elect
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:51] does we we've got something for the
[1:53:55] elect don't let it just be me having
[1:53:57] that
[1:53:59] cry say
[1:54:03] Lord let me not be
[1:54:06] ashamed let it be
[1:54:08] said oh there goes the man there goes
[1:54:11] the Son of God down back
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:16] Drive he's got Jesus in him he's
[1:54:20] there's let the screams come out
[1:54:24] [Music]
