[35:21] because of what's happening in this
[35:23] world today
[35:25] or the prophet of God made it very known
[35:28] that what Hollywood's going to do is
[35:31] going to express the whole world one day
[35:34] in Lord
[35:35] we're seeing the corruption
[35:37] they're trying to get the Bibles
[35:40] out of
[35:42] California now
[35:45] we know our government is rotten to a
[35:49] core father God
[35:51] and Lord there's a young man father God
[35:53] said it in the hospital Lord
[35:56] that has tried to give his heart to you
[35:58] Lord
[36:00] been over consumed with alcohol and now
[36:03] his
[36:04] the pleasure of this world has taken his
[36:06] body father God and if it ain't
[36:10] ain't fit for anything father God except
[36:13] death
[36:15] but Lord he has a soul
[36:18] and Lord
[36:20] whatever it takes to get that young man
[36:22] Lord to get his attention Lord to call
[36:26] upon your wonderful name of Grace
[36:30] Lord
[36:31] he's telling his big brother that he's
[36:33] not going to drink no more he's not
[36:35] going to do these things or more but
[36:37] Lord
[36:39] it takes him to get on your your ground
[36:43] on your foundation
[36:45] the Lord we just ask you to use brother
[36:48] Joe I mean brother Mike and sister
[36:51] Denise to comfort him
[36:54] the Lord I pray you go to him
[36:56] and meet him Lord
[36:58] and bring them to your bloody side Lord

[37:13] be with him this morning

[37:19] he's struggling father God
[37:22] the law that doctors are running them
[37:24] around and around
[37:27] and Lord you said father God
[37:31] when the doctors can't do anything else
[37:34] or running people around not trying to
[37:36] help them
[37:38] I feel is in the same kind of category
[37:40] Lord
[37:42] he loves you Lord I know he talks about
[37:45] you all the time
[37:47] we just ask you Lord to have mercy upon
[37:50] him this morning
[37:51] I pray Lord that you touch him from the
[37:54] bottom of his feet to the top of his
[37:55] head not because he's worthy of it Lord
[37:58] but you called him Lord
[38:00] that's your child Lord God I ask you
[38:03] Lord to touch him this morning Father

[42:07] Mr in Isaiah 21 and 11.
[42:10] he happy to be in the house of the Lord
[42:11] this morning
[42:13] amen
[42:15] I've been watching the services that our
[42:18] pastor has been preaching there in
[42:19] Canada and looks like they've been going
[42:21] very well I've been feeling the presence
[42:24] at the house so I know that it's been
[42:26] Supernatural hey he's been fought to get
[42:28] there his tickets was canceled or his
[42:30] flight was canceled he lost his luggage
[42:33] he got to Denver and didn't have his
[42:34] ticket to get to Canada and so he's
[42:37] they've been an uphill battle but
[42:40] they've made it and the Lord's been
[42:41] blessing the services so
[42:44] amen Isaiah 21 and 11 the burden of Duma
[42:49] he called to me out of seer Watchman
[42:52] what of the night Watchmen what of the
[42:54] night the Watchman said the the morning
[42:57] cometh and also the night if you were in
[43:00] a choir inquire ye return and come amen
[43:04] May bow our heads this morning dear
[43:06] gracious Heavenly Father Lord you've
[43:08] been so good to us God you've brought us
[43:10] in to your house safely Lord you kept us
[43:13] safe throughout the week Lord last week
[43:15] Lord has been coming to your presence
[43:17] Lord I ask that you would be in this
[43:19] part of the service Lord I ask that you
[43:22] would anoint me God As I Lay myself
[43:24] aside and I asked that you would speak
[43:25] to these lips of clay Lord you know the
[43:27] needs that are in the in the building
[43:29] this morning the the hearts father I ask
[43:31] that as the word would come forth Lord
[43:33] that there would be somebody to receive
[43:35] a blessing father we ask these things in
[43:38] your precious name amen you may be
[43:40] seated
[43:41] if I had just a simple subject this
[43:44] morning it would be Watchmen what of the
[43:46] night anyway it's a simple subject but I
[43:49] pray something can be said to be a
[43:50] blessing but a Watchman was put in a
[43:53] position where he could see higher than
[43:56] everyone else he was put in the tower
[43:58] where he had a vision that nobody else
[44:01] would have and he was to let the people
[44:02] know if the enemy was attacking let them
[44:05] know uh the time of day and they would
[44:07] really rely on him at the night time
[44:09] they would rely on him for the time of
[44:12] the night if the enemy was coming if
[44:14] danger was coming but it needed to be
[44:16] somebody who knew the position of the
[44:18] Stars so not anybody could be a Watchman
[44:21] but it was somebody that had good
[44:22] eyesight that was able to see you know I
[44:25] started to think of it could you imagine
[44:26] that if your family's life was in
[44:29] somebody that was nearsighted or
[44:30] farsighted or or was cross-eyed or or
[44:33] didn't care about your family's life
[44:35] didn't care about the city you want to
[44:37] want somebody like that for your life to
[44:40] depend on but the Watchman had to be
[44:41] somebody that could see far out there
[44:44] that could read the stars that had your
[44:46] life in in his mind not caring about
[44:49] himself but he was willing to risk it
[44:51] all to let you know that danger was
[44:53] coming to let you know what the time of
[44:55] the day was and brother Branham says the
[44:58] enemy likes to move at night time so at
[45:01] the night time it was very important to
[45:03] rely on the Watchmen to be your eyes you
[45:06] see brother Brandon would say this then
[45:08] when they were all there dancing and
[45:10] going on like a modern Pearl Harbor when
[45:12] they were dancing stripping young ladies
[45:14] of their clothes running them through
[45:15] the streets and so forth and all of a
[45:17] sudden there was an attack the enemy
[45:20] watches for night time to come he likes
[45:22] to come in the night the great air rage
[45:24] in our army today is at night time so we
[45:27] see the devil dwells in darkness if he
[45:30] can keep you in darkness he can pull you
[45:32] into death you see darkness and death
[45:35] always dwells together you look at Luke
[45:37] 1 and 79 to give light to them that sit
[45:39] in darkness in the shadow of death so
[45:43] what he is saying here there's a light
[45:44] that is coming that is going to pull you
[45:47] out of the stair of the snare of
[45:49] darkness which is death but it's only a
[45:52] light that can pull you out of the
[45:54] darkness and brother Branham would say
[45:56] this without light nothing can live
[45:58] without light and so with Darkness
[46:00] there's always death but with light
[46:02] there is always life it continues on to
[46:05] save there was no life upon the Earth
[46:07] today that but what has come by the
[46:09] Light of the Sun in botany life and so
[46:12] forth and there was no eternal life
[46:14] outside of the Son of God see he is the
[46:18] light so without light there's no life
[46:20] but with light there was no death and
[46:24] you see I believe that there was a time
[46:26] when Jesus was in the Tomb then it was a
[46:28] total darkness that there was a black
[46:30] cow but there come a time that there was
[46:32] a word that was prophesied for his life
[46:35] that that word was going to start to
[46:37] produce itself you look at Psalms 16 and
[46:39] 10 for thou will not leave my soul and
[46:41] hell neither without leave thou suffer
[46:44] or without suffer that Holy One to seek
[46:46] corruption so in the midst of death in
[46:49] the midst of Darkness there was a light
[46:51] that was starting to burn there was a
[46:53] light that was starting to produce
[46:55] itself so no matter how strong Darkness
[46:58] was how strong death was how strong the
[47:01] tomb was the hell was when that life
[47:03] started to come to pass nothing could
[47:06] hold it and so the Bible is saying once
[47:09] the light comes darkness is going to
[47:11] leave death is going to leave but it
[47:13] only takes the light to bring this to
[47:16] pass you look out Psalms 119 and 130 the
[47:19] entrance of thy words giveth life it
[47:22] giveth understanding so the light of
[47:25] thou Watchman was in sight he was to
[47:28] watch during the night so he wasn't
[47:30] bringing a natural light to the people
[47:32] but his Insight was alike to the people
[47:35] that they could see it was an
[47:37] understanding that they were in safe
[47:39] hands it was an understanding that it
[47:42] was 3 A.M 5 a.m they couldn't see with
[47:45] their natural eyes but the Watchman
[47:48] sight had become their eyes it had
[47:51] become very light and that's what the
[47:53] Bible is saying thy words giveth light
[47:55] it giveth understanding so they were
[47:58] sitting in a dark place at midnight of 3
[48:01] A.M the darkest time of the night but
[48:04] they were still dwelling in light and I
[48:06] thought mine were in the darkest age of
[48:08] there is it's been promising or there's
[48:10] been promised that it's going to be
[48:11] brought up gross Darkness upon the
[48:13] people it's gonna be a dark time but at
[48:16] the same time in the evening time it
[48:19] shall be light and what is the light it
[48:21] is the words that has been brought in
[48:23] this generation that in the midst of
[48:26] Darkness there's an understanding that
[48:29] we can see that there's a future home we
[48:32] can see there's a rapture we can see
[48:34] there's a body change we can believe
[48:36] there's an invincible Army upon the
[48:38] Earth because of a spiritual Insight
[48:41] that is been given by The Watchmen you
[48:44] see but you notice the Bible says that
[48:46] if the Watchman didn't give the warning
[48:48] the blood of the people would be on his
[48:51] hands and so I thought my brother
[48:53] Branham did not want to be known as a
[48:55] woman hater he didn't want to be known
[48:57] as an old crank he didn't want to be
[49:00] known as somebody that was cranking but
[49:03] he had a responsibility and that was to
[49:06] bring light to a generation that was in
[49:09] darkness and I thought my and here we
[49:12] are in the middle of Darkness but God
[49:14] has given us a light where we can see
[49:16] you look at Ezekiel 33-6 but if the
[49:20] Watchman see the sword come and blow not
[49:22] the trumpet and the people be not warned
[49:25] if the sword come and take any person
[49:27] from among them he is taking away in his
[49:30] iniquity but his blood I require after
[49:34] watchman's hand but once the Watchman
[49:36] puts out his responsibility it warns the
[49:40] people then that responsibility goes
[49:43] from the Watchman to the here so no
[49:46] longer is it on the watchman's hands but
[49:49] now the light goes from The Watchmen to
[49:52] the people so no longer does the people
[49:55] have an excuse for Darkness because now
[49:58] there's a light that is coming they are
[50:00] taking the words of the Watchmen and now
[50:03] can dwell in a light but the Bible also
[50:06] says that if they hear the Watchmen and
[50:09] they do not listen to us warning the
[50:11] blood is now on their hands so now it's
[50:14] no longer The Watch
[50:16] responsibility but now it is on the
[50:19] people but anybody can be your Watchmen
[50:21] the Bible says in first John 4-1 believe
[50:25] not every Spirit but try the spirits
[50:27] whether they are of God but many false
[50:30] prophets are gone out into the world so
[50:33] you notice that the Watchman was not
[50:35] just giving any time of the day by his
[50:38] own knowledge but he was watching the
[50:40] Stars so his time was giving by what God
[50:44] spoke into existence anybody could have
[50:46] said it's three o'clock anybody could
[50:49] say It's Five O'Clock anybody could say
[50:51] but not all of them was Vindicated it
[50:54] had to be somebody that had a
[50:57] Vindication by the heavens and on my
[50:59] begotten message that wasn't by a man's
[51:02] intellect but it was Vindicated by the
[51:05] heavens it was Vindicated by the by the
[51:08] the pyramids of the Bible says it was
[51:10] Vindicated by the spoken word of God it
[51:13] was Vindicated so that you can know that
[51:16] time of the day we're not living in the
[51:19] beginning of the church ages but we're
[51:21] living at the end where it's rapturing
[51:23] time it's time to go home we're not
[51:26] dwelling in darkness any longer we're
[51:28] living in the midst of Darkness but
[51:30] darkness is not overtaking us but light
[51:33] is overtaking us but you see brother
[51:36] Branham says spiritual Insight of the
[51:39] word has been swapped with a bunch of
[51:41] creates so even though God has given an
[51:44] Insight you have to receive it and make
[51:47] it your light anybody can be your
[51:49] Watchman anything can be your light but
[51:52] you've got a choice to choose the
[51:54] Vindicated Watchmen or choose a Creed
[51:57] you have a choice to choose a scripture
[51:59] Watchman a star Watchmen or to choose
[52:03] somebody that is making up time brother
[52:05] Branham says that uh it would be like a
[52:08] man saying there's no such thing as a
[52:10] son he says there's no sun I'm going to
[52:13] run into the basement I'm going to lock
[52:14] the doors and dwell in Darkness because
[52:17] there is no sun he says that man would
[52:20] have something mentally wrong with him
[52:22] because there is a son but he's refusing
[52:25] to acknowledge it and he says right
[52:28] there he's refusing the health-given
[52:30] substance that the son brings and so now
[52:33] he's dwelling in darkness because he
[52:36] refuses to acknowledge a god-given light
[52:39] but I don't believe the bride is
[52:42] refusing the god-given light but she's
[52:45] accepting the message of the hour the
[52:47] light that is given in the evening time
[52:50] and is dwelling in our living in
[52:52] darkness but dwelling in the light oh my
[52:56] there's something mentally wrong with
[52:57] him brother Branham says and so you see
[53:00] refusing the insights of the light your
[53:03] dwelling and groping in darkness even
[53:05] though the same things are there but you
[53:07] can't see them I know we've given the
[53:09] example before but if you come to this
[53:12] building and there's no lights on and
[53:14] it's Pitch Black in here you're going to
[53:15] stop over things that is already there
[53:18] the darkness in a put Affair but
[53:20] darkness is keeping you from seeing what
[53:23] is already there and so if you're
[53:24] tripping over the pews you don't know
[53:27] what is there so now you're guessing
[53:29] what you're tripping over you can say
[53:31] I'm tripping over the pulpit I'm
[53:33] tripping over the speaker I'm tripping
[53:35] over the piano I'm tripping over this
[53:37] I'm tripping over that because you don't
[53:39] have an insight to tell you what is
[53:42] there but once the light comes on you
[53:45] can see what is in front of you but now
[53:47] you've got a choice to either accept
[53:49] what the inside brings or I'll continue
[53:53] in the darkness that your mind has
[53:56] because if you trip over the Pew and you
[53:58] say I think it's a piano but when the
[54:00] light comes on you can say well it looks
[54:03] like a Pew but I think it's a piano so
[54:05] now you're coming down to a choice to
[54:08] believe what the light says or believe
[54:10] what the reasoning says oh come on now
[54:13] that sounds like a lot of people that
[54:15] comes to a message Church the light of
[54:18] the word is shining Upon A Heart shining
[54:21] upon the word but too many times we
[54:24] refuse the inside of the word that the
[54:27] Watchman has brought and accept the
[54:29] reasoning but you see there's there
[54:31] there can be no guessing in the things
[54:33] of God God has given us a Vindication
[54:36] that we're no longer guessing what is in
[54:39] front of us you see the pews immense to
[54:42] be tripped over they're meant to be set
[54:44] on so once the light comes on we're no
[54:47] longer tripping over it but we're
[54:49] putting it into action you see once the
[54:51] light comes over the word of God we're
[54:54] no longer tripping over serpents say
[54:56] tripping over water baptism tripping
[54:58] over the the godhead we're no longer
[55:01] tripping over these things but now we're
[55:03] putting them into action you see they're
[55:05] not meant to be tripped over but without
[55:08] a light you can't see what is in front
[55:10] of you but with the light we can take
[55:13] the promises of God and defeat every
[55:15] spirit it defeat every devil defeat
[55:18] every addiction there's nothing that can
[55:20] stand in front of the Bride that is
[55:23] living in the light of the hour oh my
[55:26] brother Branham says how did we get the
[55:28] natural Sun it was the spoken word of
[55:30] God he said let there be light he says
[55:33] there may have taken billions and
[55:34] billions of years but once thou word
[55:37] started to come to pass nothing could
[55:39] stop it and he says the light started to
[55:42] press through the darkness and as the
[55:44] light started to press Darkness started
[55:47] the fleet Darkness started to leave
[55:49] because Darkness has no power in the
[55:52] presence of the Sun and we've got the
[55:54] light in this last day darkness was over
[55:57] homes Darkness was over churches
[56:00] Darkness was over light but once the
[56:02] message come by your way Darkness had to
[56:05] leave those addictions had to leave
[56:07] there's a power that's been given to the
[56:10] bride of Christ through the light
[56:12] it's not a man-made light it's a light
[56:15] that is pressing the darkness it's
[56:17] pressing down on belief it's pressing
[56:20] our reasoning it's a life that you might
[56:23] see that you could see but first it's
[56:26] got to be your eyes you gotta believe
[56:28] the light like they were saying the the
[56:30] watchman's light was not a physical
[56:33] flashlight but it was an insight
[56:36] it wasn't a natural light but it was an
[56:39] Insight that he might not that he might
[56:42] know what is going on in the midst of
[56:44] darkness and oh my the word in a natural
[56:47] flashlight but it's an Insight that you
[56:50] might know what is going on in the midst
[56:53] of Darkness but you see you could not
[56:56] put your confidence in a man if he was
[56:59] cross-sighted you would be living in a
[57:01] constant fear you're believing in
[57:03] anxiety you'll be living not knowing
[57:05] what the future holds you want to know
[57:08] what tomorrow is going to take place you
[57:10] want to know because you would not have
[57:12] confidence in the Watchmen but once
[57:15] there's an Insight you can put
[57:16] confidence in there's no longer anxiety
[57:19] but there's a trust but you see it all
[57:22] comes down to an inside inside is so
[57:25] important to have faith in it becomes
[57:28] your lies it becomes your guide you know
[57:31] I started to think about it in Hebrews
[57:32] 11 and 1. now Faith is the substance of
[57:35] things hoped for him the evidence of
[57:38] Things Not Seen for buy it the elders
[57:40] obtained a good report through faith we
[57:44] understand that the worlds were framed
[57:46] by the word of God so the things which
[57:49] are seen were not made excuse me which
[57:52] so when I'm made of things which do
[57:54] appear but then it goes through by faith
[57:57] Abel by faith Enoch by faith Noah by
[58:00] faith Abraham by faith Sarah and he
[58:02] starts to go through all of these uh the
[58:05] the the the the faith Champions but
[58:07] where is he getting all of these
[58:09] examples he's getting them in Genesis
[58:11] who knows who wrote Genesis
[58:14] Moses Moses wrote Genesis but was Moses
[58:18] there when Sarah was on Earth
[58:21] was Moses there when God said let there
[58:24] be light was a Moses hair when Abraham
[58:27] got his body changed was Moses there
[58:30] when Noah built an ark he was not there
[58:33] but it was a Watchman that was put in a
[58:36] position where he could see him bring
[58:39] back an Insight oh come on now many
[58:42] people have a hard time with the message
[58:44] because it's a fallen man it was a
[58:47] fallen mouthpiece but he had an Insight
[58:49] that went beyond a fallen man he had an
[58:53] Insight that went be hard a fallen
[58:56] understanding just like Moses could save
[58:58] Mama Sarah had a body change and had a
[59:02] baby how do you know brother Moses I
[59:04] have a spiritual insight and if you
[59:07] would just listen to my insight just
[59:10] like Sarah had a body change you can
[59:12] have a body change just like Enoch was
[59:15] raptured you can be raptured but you've
[59:17] got to listen to the insights that I'm
[59:20] giving you so now the Apostle Paul is
[59:23] bringing it down and saying through
[59:25] faith we understand that the worlds were
[59:28] framed by the word of God through faith
[59:31] in his understanding through faith in
[59:33] his Insight it brings a revelation of
[59:37] what God is doing oh my but you see
[59:40] brother Branham was lifted up where he
[59:42] could see before the creation he could
[59:45] see before but the Branham says that God
[59:47] is an object of worship and before I
[59:49] before God was God there was nobody to
[59:52] worship him so he created the angels and
[59:55] the angels worshiped up him day and
[59:57] night but he longed to be a father and
[59:59] he could not be a father to the angels
[1:00:01] he could not be a Healer to the angels
[1:00:04] he could not be a delivery to the angels
[1:00:06] so he created the son so that he could
[1:00:09] be a father to him that he could heal
[1:00:12] his wounds that he could set him free
[1:00:14] how do we know that brother Josh it was
[1:00:16] an Insight from a prophet from a
[1:00:19] Watchman that got lifted up so high so
[1:00:22] that we can now see we haven't seen it
[1:00:25] with our natural eyes but faith in that
[1:00:27] insight has brought a revelation oh my
[1:00:31] remember when he will be on the curtain
[1:00:33] of time he told us of things that was
[1:00:35] taking place he come back and he says I
[1:00:38] seen you there we wasn't there we can't
[1:00:40] see it right now with our natural lives
[1:00:43] but faith in that Insight is producing a
[1:00:46] revelation that there's nothing that can
[1:00:49] keep me from the future home
[1:00:52] if you can never get a revelation of
[1:00:54] this message there's no devil that can
[1:00:57] keep you down there's not there's no
[1:00:59] pornography and reasoning and addictions
[1:01:01] that can keep you down once you get a
[1:01:03] revelation of the insights that God has
[1:01:06] given
[1:01:07] you see it's a Watchman that God has
[1:01:10] given by the brand of Likens these
[1:01:12] Watchmen will watch men's the prophets
[1:01:14] he says they're built farther they're
[1:01:16] built to be able to see farther than
[1:01:19] anybody else he says but the higher that
[1:01:21] the eagle climbs higher and our father
[1:01:23] will take his team and God Likens His
[1:01:26] prophets to Eagles and they are the
[1:01:28] Watchmen the clam higher so they can see
[1:01:31] farther off and their eyes are made so
[1:01:33] spiritual that they can see the
[1:01:35] approaching dangers and God sent Isaiah
[1:01:38] to warn the people that there was an
[1:01:40] approaching danger and they would not
[1:01:42] listen to him and today God still has
[1:01:44] Eagles our Messengers our man is on the
[1:01:48] tower who climbs up in the spirit far
[1:01:50] beyond the man uh the atomic bombs and
[1:01:53] the scientific researches he has the men
[1:01:55] who are specially designed for the
[1:01:57] purpose who climbs the ramparts of
[1:02:00] Calvary in the name of Jesus and stands
[1:02:02] at the top of the Cross and sends back a
[1:02:05] message the saith the Lord he says they
[1:02:09] send back a message for saith the Lord
[1:02:11] he still has the messengers that are led
[1:02:14] by the spirit and are left help of our
[1:02:17] pastor has been going through the church
[1:02:19] ages and he's saying The Messengers were
[1:02:22] all anointed by The Same Spirit that
[1:02:25] just doesn't hit home for me Wednesday
[1:02:26] and I just love that it's all the same
[1:02:28] spirit with an anointing that is coming
[1:02:31] to these Messengers bringing the light
[1:02:34] of the day but in this day we didn't get
[1:02:36] a portion of the light we got the
[1:02:39] fullness of the light we're no longer
[1:02:41] just looking at justification we're not
[1:02:43] just looking at sanctification we're not
[1:02:45] just looking at the restoration of the
[1:02:47] gifts but we're looking at the
[1:02:50] restoration of the word and with the
[1:02:52] restoration of the word comes the power
[1:02:54] comes the anointing comes the Dominion
[1:02:58] we've been restored just like Adam could
[1:03:01] speak to Nature speak to the wind
[1:03:03] there's the Primus on Earth that has the
[1:03:05] same spoken word you might not have to
[1:03:07] speak the name sure you might not have
[1:03:09] to speak squirrels into existence but
[1:03:11] you can't speak the cancer out of
[1:03:13] existence you can speak for your loved
[1:03:16] ones to come home you can speak for your
[1:03:18] sons and your daughters to accept the
[1:03:20] Holy Ghost it's the light of the hour
[1:03:22] that has brought the restoration of the
[1:03:25] power
[1:03:27] hallelujah it's a continuation of the
[1:03:30] book of Acts
[1:03:32] oh Hallelujah
[1:03:34] you see brother Branham talks about the
[1:03:36] carnival he says if we didn't have
[1:03:38] enough money to get in there we would
[1:03:40] come to the fence and he says there if
[1:03:43] there was a a hole in the fence he says
[1:03:45] maybe you're not tall enough to see him
[1:03:47] there but I am he says I would jump up
[1:03:50] and grab the fence and pull myself up
[1:03:52] and look through there and come back
[1:03:55] down and you would say what did you see
[1:03:57] brother Banner he was saying I seen an
[1:03:59] elephant he says my but what else did
[1:04:01] you see he would jump up there pull
[1:04:03] himself up look in there it says I sent
[1:04:06] a giraffe I see the monkey I seen a
[1:04:09] zebra we could not see it for ourselves
[1:04:11] because we wasn't built high enough to
[1:04:14] sin but God gave somebody who was built
[1:04:18] high enough where they put she in there
[1:04:21] oh my became we had a Prophet The
[1:04:24] Comeback that's inside saying that God
[1:04:27] still feels with the Holy Ghost they're
[1:04:29] saying he don't but God still heals the
[1:04:32] sick they're saying they don't but still
[1:04:34] delivers the bound they're saying they
[1:04:36] don't but I'm looking with some insight
[1:04:38] letting you know that Jesus Christ is
[1:04:41] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:04:45] if you can just believe this inside all
[1:04:48] of Heaven is being restored if you can
[1:04:51] just believe this light you can speak
[1:04:54] the word you can see your loved ones
[1:04:56] healed you can see your sons and
[1:04:58] daughters filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:01] hallelujah it's an Insight that has been
[1:05:04] given to the bride
[1:05:06] oh hallelujah it's a Watchman that has
[1:05:10] given us a light given us an
[1:05:12] understanding that we can see
[1:05:15] oh we're not builts like brother praying
[1:05:18] them to go up there but we are built to
[1:05:21] believe what he saw
[1:05:23] oh my like our Pastor said Wednesday he
[1:05:26] was helpless in himself he would stand
[1:05:29] by telling testimonies for 20 30 45
[1:05:31] minutes it says you know what I'm doing
[1:05:33] I'm waiting for him I can't do nothing
[1:05:36] without him but then he would say he is
[1:05:38] here
[1:05:39] he is here I take every Spirit under my
[1:05:42] control that wasn't a man that was the
[1:05:45] spirit that was the anointing then he
[1:05:48] could read people's hearts he could tell
[1:05:51] him what happened you may say I want
[1:05:53] scripture Ezekiel 11 and 5 and the
[1:05:55] spirit of the Lord fell upon them the
[1:05:58] same spirit that anointed our Prophet
[1:06:00] fell upon Ezekiel and said unto me speak
[1:06:03] thus saith the Lord thus have you said o
[1:06:06] House of Israel for I know that I know
[1:06:09] the things that come in your mind every
[1:06:12] one of them that wasn't a man revealing
[1:06:15] the hearts that was the spirit coming to
[1:06:18] us here coming to somebody with insights
[1:06:21] and letting them know the secrets of the
[1:06:23] heart we got a prophet in this last day
[1:06:26] that had an insight and lets you know
[1:06:29] let you know the secrets of the heart
[1:06:31] but he also lets you know the future he
[1:06:35] lets you know nothing can keep you out
[1:06:37] of a Rapture nothing to keep you out of
[1:06:39] the body change if you can just believe
[1:06:41] the insight
[1:06:44] Hallelujah if you can just believe the
[1:06:47] Watchman he will become your eyes
[1:06:50] Hallelujah he will become your eyes The
[1:06:54] Same Spirit that show Moses what
[1:06:57] happened in the beginning Was the Same
[1:06:58] Spirit the show John what is happening
[1:07:01] at the end the Bible says John was in
[1:07:04] the spirit on the Lord's day it wasn't a
[1:07:07] natural Spirit but he was caught up in
[1:07:09] the spirit and transported into the
[1:07:12] Lord's day which is a future events he
[1:07:15] was a prophet that was lifted up by the
[1:07:17] anointing
[1:07:18] oh my look at Ezekiel 11 24 afterwards
[1:07:23] the spirit took me up and brought me in
[1:07:26] a vision by the spirit of God in
[1:07:29] charadia to them to them to the
[1:07:31] Captivity so the vision that I had seen
[1:07:34] went up from me then I spake unto them
[1:07:37] of the Captivity all the things that the
[1:07:41] Lord had showed me
[1:07:44] he's doing the same thing for the
[1:07:45] Brandon was doing
[1:07:47] it wasn't a man it was an anointing
[1:07:50] coming to a prophet somebody that was
[1:07:53] built to see it
[1:07:55] oh come on somebody just like a job he
[1:07:59] says I know my redeemer liveth and not
[1:08:01] be healed My Flesh won't see corruption
[1:08:05] he did not see the Redeemer if there's a
[1:08:07] natural ice but the spirit lifted him up
[1:08:10] oh come on somebody the spirit lifted
[1:08:13] him up that he could see the Redeemer
[1:08:15] Jesus wasn't on Earth yet he wasn't he
[1:08:19] didn't go to the Cross yet he didn't go
[1:08:21] to Calvary yet but the spirit lifted him
[1:08:24] up where he could see the Redeemer and
[1:08:27] not believe his Insight I know my
[1:08:30] redeemer lives I know Hallelujah I don't
[1:08:32] care what I'm going through because of
[1:08:35] jobs inside I know my redeemer lives
[1:08:39] Hallelujah he was lifted up where he
[1:08:43] could see it it was an insight
[1:08:46] Hallelujah
[1:08:48] brother Branham says this God would not
[1:08:50] put a man in a tower there now what
[1:08:52] preacher wishy-washy gospel and not tell
[1:08:55] the truth and won the people of the
[1:08:58] Wrath that is to come he put a man in
[1:09:01] there that would be bold and would have
[1:09:03] the spirit that seen the upcoming
[1:09:05] judgment
[1:09:07] that would have their spirits that seen
[1:09:10] the upcoming judgment
[1:09:12] you notice how he's saying that the
[1:09:14] spirits in the upcoming judgment
[1:09:16] you notice how he's put in that he would
[1:09:18] hide the spirit that seen the upcoming
[1:09:21] judgment and regardless of what the
[1:09:23] people said he would warn them anyhow
[1:09:25] cry out against it he doesn't put blind
[1:09:28] prophets in his Tower he puts prophets
[1:09:31] preachers who who foresee the coming
[1:09:34] judgment and warns the people to flee he
[1:09:37] don't put blind prophets in the
[1:09:39] Watchtower
[1:09:40] this says one thing but it don't happen
[1:09:44] oh come on brother Branham have prophecy
[1:09:47] after prophecy after prophecy
[1:09:48] discernment after discernment after his
[1:09:50] sermon he wasn't a blind prophet
[1:09:53] he was somebody that the spirit took
[1:09:56] control and showed him the secrets of
[1:09:59] the heart
[1:10:00] remember brother Branham says he turned
[1:10:02] around and he had us back to the crowd
[1:10:04] and was refilled revealing the secrets
[1:10:07] of the heart that wasn't a man that was
[1:10:10] the anointing letting you know that the
[1:10:13] same God now walked on Earth is the same
[1:10:16] God here not if not William praying him
[1:10:18] but the words in the beginning was the
[1:10:21] world the word was with God and the Word
[1:10:23] was God and the Word was made flesh so
[1:10:27] the same word that dwelled in Jesus is
[1:10:29] the same word that's been restored in
[1:10:32] this day Hey whenever Jesus went off the
[1:10:35] scene
[1:10:37] the accident go with him but the
[1:10:40] apostles were doing the same signs that
[1:10:43] Jesus was doing come on now and when the
[1:10:45] apostles went off the scene the acts
[1:10:48] didn't go with them but the same signs
[1:10:50] and wonders that the apostles did in the
[1:10:53] book of Acts is the same science and
[1:10:56] wonders that the pride is doing we're
[1:10:58] laying hands on the sick recovering
[1:11:01] we're casting out spirits to move
[1:11:04] somebody it's not different actions
[1:11:06] because of a different word it's the
[1:11:09] same word producing the same actions
[1:11:12] hallelujah it's the same word it's the
[1:11:16] light it's brought in insights where we
[1:11:19] can sing you see an inside brings
[1:11:21] assurance
[1:11:22] well you don't you don't got to worry I
[1:11:24] think I may have given this before I
[1:11:25] don't know but if so that's always
[1:11:28] aggravating when you're trying to scare
[1:11:30] somebody you're hiding behind the door
[1:11:32] or hiding behind the wall and somebody
[1:11:34] says Hey the person you're trying to
[1:11:36] scare somebody says hey he's hiding
[1:11:38] behind the door trying to scare you
[1:11:40] so as she as he walks up there you jump
[1:11:43] out and try to scare him but it don't
[1:11:45] scare them because they got an insight
[1:11:48] what would naturally scare them well
[1:11:50] it's not scaring them because they had
[1:11:52] somebody that knew the Future come on
[1:11:55] somebody we can go through daily
[1:11:57] struggles but we've got an assurance
[1:11:59] that my future is in concrete there's no
[1:12:03] devil Spirit no Leo to see his Spirit no
[1:12:06] lukewarmness no formalism can't keep me
[1:12:09] out of a Rapture because I know my
[1:12:12] future
[1:12:14] oh Hallelujah there's an assurance that
[1:12:18] comes with Insight it's a revelation you
[1:12:21] know I know the story Mark Lowry tells
[1:12:23] about how he said he survived the
[1:12:24] tornado I'm sure many people's heard it
[1:12:26] before but he says he was in the lake
[1:12:28] bar a houseboat and there was a tornado
[1:12:31] that come back and he started there
[1:12:33] started at the boats through him back
[1:12:35] and forth he was crying and screaming he
[1:12:37] was scared to death but he walks out
[1:12:39] after the tornado and he says there's a
[1:12:41] bunch of guys that were laughing saying
[1:12:43] wow we survived another one he says how
[1:12:46] were you guys so happy he says You must
[1:12:48] be new here this is Tornado Alley this
[1:12:51] happens all the time and he says this he
[1:12:54] says if I'd known I was going to survive
[1:12:57] it would have been fun for me too he
[1:12:59] didn't know the future so the present
[1:13:02] state was making him wishy-washing but
[1:13:05] the bride knows the future you know
[1:13:08] you're gonna survive so the trials that
[1:13:10] you go through don't push you around
[1:13:12] circumstances that you go through don't
[1:13:16] push you around hard times that you go
[1:13:19] through does not push you around there's
[1:13:21] an Insight that you know the future
[1:13:26] it's an assurance it's a light
[1:13:30] Psalms 11 4 and to the upright there
[1:13:33] will rise of the light in the darkness
[1:13:34] there's a rising of light in the
[1:13:37] darkness Isaiah 60 and 2 for behold
[1:13:40] Darkness shall cover the Earth gross
[1:13:43] Darkness the people but the Lord Capital
[1:13:46] l-o-r-t the shall arise upon thee
[1:13:50] and His glory shall be seen upon thee he
[1:13:54] didn't just say the Lord is going to
[1:13:56] arise he's not just coming for any
[1:13:59] purpose but he's coming to bring light
[1:14:01] to you
[1:14:03] the Lord is all right has arisen upon
[1:14:06] thee and His glory shall be seen upon
[1:14:09] thee what's his glory his power will be
[1:14:13] seen upon thee how do we know that
[1:14:17] there's a sun in the sky because there's
[1:14:19] an earth that is reflecting the Sun but
[1:14:21] the Branham talks about Purdue he says
[1:14:23] the Dew it's pretty in the mornings
[1:14:25] because it's sparkling but he says that
[1:14:28] when it happened in the dark times the
[1:14:30] ninth Honda the the the the the the do
[1:14:32] is not sparkling but once the sun comes
[1:14:35] up and starts to reflect through the Dew
[1:14:38] it Sparkles and its glory is seen on the
[1:14:41] earth oh come on somebody the same Glory
[1:14:45] that the sun is shining is now being
[1:14:47] reflected upon somebody that is shining
[1:14:50] it through them their lives to do is
[1:14:53] shining the same lights and that's the
[1:14:55] way it is with the pride the Lord has
[1:14:57] arisen upon thee and His glory shall be
[1:15:00] seen upon thee so the same power of the
[1:15:05] message is now upon the bride you're
[1:15:08] walking as a Victorious Army you're an
[1:15:10] invincible Army you're more than
[1:15:12] conquerors you're marching over every
[1:15:14] sickness over every Spirit his glory is
[1:15:18] reflecting itself upon somebody that can
[1:15:21] believe it
[1:15:23] Hallelujah somebody that can believe the
[1:15:26] Insight starts to reflect it
[1:15:29] you see its influences you know you
[1:15:32] don't got to go to Hollywood for
[1:15:34] Hollywood to influence you
[1:15:36] come on now you don't got to go to

[1:15:44] to let it come into your derailing place
[1:15:46] them the same influence that Hollywood
[1:15:49] has in California or wherever it's at is
[1:15:52] the same influence in your home
[1:15:55] oh come on now and that's an Earthly
[1:15:57] influence what about the Heavenly
[1:16:00] influence there's been an influence
[1:16:02] that's been given to the bride because
[1:16:04] of the light we might not be in heaven
[1:16:07] but we're sitting in Heavenly places
[1:16:08] we're sighting in an atmosphere in an
[1:16:11] anointing where it's influencing my life
[1:16:14] it's changing the way we're talking you
[1:16:17] know you let somebody a little girl
[1:16:18] that's here that that is focusing and so
[1:16:21] willing upon Hollywood is going to
[1:16:23] change the way she dresses it changes
[1:16:25] the way she acts it changes the way she
[1:16:28] talks she has an influence that she's
[1:16:30] trying to be like but what about the
[1:16:32] message come on somebody what if he let
[1:16:35] that be our Center focus
[1:16:37] in her homes in our families on the job
[1:16:40] site then it starts to change us to what
[1:16:43] is influencing us
[1:16:48] the glory of the Lord shall be seen on
[1:16:51] you we're manifesting the light so it
[1:16:54] doesn't it ain't saying it's taking the
[1:16:56] darkness away but he's pushing the light
[1:16:58] through the darkness you see it might be
[1:17:01] in a dark season of life but the glory
[1:17:03] of the Lord is still there you might not
[1:17:05] feel the anointing you might feel like
[1:17:07] your mind's about to fall apart you
[1:17:09] might feel like your marriage is about
[1:17:10] to fall apart but if the glory of the
[1:17:12] Lord is seen upon you he hasn't
[1:17:15] forgotten about you it was the dark time
[1:17:17] of Sarah that God showed up it was at a
[1:17:21] dark time where when when God showed up
[1:17:23] it says I'm going to show up at the time
[1:17:25] of life and you're going to have a son
[1:17:28] and what does Sarah do she was at a dark
[1:17:30] time she was at a low time and laughed
[1:17:33] and says how can I have this baby
[1:17:36] but then the angel of the Lord says is
[1:17:38] anything too hard for God he was at the
[1:17:42] darkest time of Sarah that he revealed
[1:17:45] the true power of God come on somebody
[1:17:48] it was at her darkest time that he was
[1:17:51] saying I will return at the appointed
[1:17:54] time he come and let her know no matter
[1:17:58] the darkest time that you're in the mind
[1:18:01] battles that you're facing I've come to
[1:18:03] let you know and give you a light gives
[1:18:06] you an Insight that there's an appointed
[1:18:09] time that your body is going to be
[1:18:12] changed you may be at a low time this
[1:18:14] morning but God sent the message with an
[1:18:17] Insight that lets you know you are
[1:18:19] capable of making a Rapture the devil
[1:18:22] may be saying you've sinned your day of
[1:18:24] Grace away you fell too many times
[1:18:26] you're not able to produce the promised
[1:18:30] child but God sent the light that lets
[1:18:32] you know at the appointed time you're
[1:18:35] going to have the promise at the
[1:18:37] appointed time you're going to share the
[1:18:40] rapture
[1:18:42] at the appointed time don't give up in
[1:18:45] the darkness the light is wanting to
[1:18:47] shine through you and so now Sarah
[1:18:49] become the manifestation of the light
[1:18:52] so no longer was it just a promise but
[1:18:56] now she started to reflect it because we
[1:18:58] know what happened her and Abraham went
[1:19:00] to Egypt I believe and this was a
[1:19:02] hundred year old woman that the king
[1:19:04] looked out and says I want her to be my
[1:19:07] wife could you imagine a king that could
[1:19:09] have anybody inside of the country but
[1:19:12] he chose a hundred-year-old woman it
[1:19:15] wasn't of her age it was the light
[1:19:18] manifesting itself through her and it
[1:19:21] changed her body oh come on now the word
[1:19:24] is doing something to the bride it's not
[1:19:26] just a promise that we're hoping for but
[1:19:29] the promise is changing us day by day
[1:19:34] day by day look at John 12 and 35 then
[1:19:38] Jesus said unto them yet a little while
[1:19:40] is the light with you walk while you
[1:19:43] have the light lest Darkness come upon
[1:19:45] you for he that walketh in darkness
[1:19:48] knoweth not whether he goeth
[1:19:51] and so in darkness there's no direction
[1:19:54] in darkness there's no Assurance but the
[1:19:57] Bible is saying you have a light so walk
[1:20:00] in it lest darkness comes upon you so
[1:20:04] you notice the Bible says that the
[1:20:08] Lord is high the Lord shall arise upon
[1:20:11] you and the glory shall be seen upon
[1:20:14] thee so we're either going to Bear the
[1:20:17] manifestation of the light of the Lord
[1:20:20] or the manifestation of the darkness
[1:20:22] come on somebody saying walk in the
[1:20:25] light lest darkness comes upon you so
[1:20:28] we're dwelling in the midst of Darkness
[1:20:30] but at the same time we don't have to
[1:20:33] die we don't have to let the darkness
[1:20:35] dwell upon us there's another power that
[1:20:39] we're manifesting it ain't the power of
[1:20:41] legal to see you but it's the power of
[1:20:44] the light brother Branham says this then
[1:20:47] a fro walking in the god-given length of
[1:20:50] the hour then God takes the word that
[1:20:53] was given for the hour and Vindication
[1:20:55] he says just like he did in Genesis 1
[1:20:58] and 3 let there be light and light come
[1:21:01] forth his word been forth in light
[1:21:04] followed him it cleared away the mist
[1:21:06] and darkness went to one corner and the
[1:21:09] light shined on the other side he says
[1:21:12] he he sends his word and the lights
[1:21:15] followed him oh I hope you're catching
[1:21:18] it this morning he sent his word and I
[1:21:20] had found it so wherever the word is
[1:21:22] light follows no matter if it's in
[1:21:25] darkness if it's in chaos if it's in a
[1:21:28] hard situation A Hard trial a hard time
[1:21:31] in your life if you can receive the word
[1:21:34] you will receive the light
[1:21:36] that will give you a Direction but the
[1:21:38] random says this that's the way God does
[1:21:40] it today he sends his word for this hour
[1:21:44] and the Holy Spirit comes and makes the
[1:21:47] word live and the Darkness goes on to
[1:21:49] their Creeds and their denominations but
[1:21:52] light shines because it is the word of
[1:21:54] God being Vindicated that it is his word
[1:21:58] is true and there's no fictions about it
[1:22:01] that's just exactly scripture he says
[1:22:04] all right
[1:22:06] just the exactly scripture he says once
[1:22:09] God so let there be light he says the
[1:22:11] Mist how to roll away Darkness how to go
[1:22:13] to a corner because God said let there
[1:22:16] be you look at Genesis 1 and 3 and God
[1:22:18] said let there be light and there was
[1:22:20] light and God saw the light and that it
[1:22:23] was good and God divided the light from
[1:22:26] the darkness so he didn't do away with
[1:22:29] the darkness he allowed the darkness to
[1:22:32] stay but wherever I was Darkness could
[1:22:35] not be
[1:22:36] come on now we're done while I was
[1:22:39] Darkness could not be you see if
[1:22:42] somebody is struggling with drinking you
[1:22:44] walk by a bar there's something that's
[1:22:46] going to pull you to it if somebody
[1:22:48] smoke is struggling with smoking you go
[1:22:51] by somebody that is smoking you're going
[1:22:53] to struggle with him but if you go by if
[1:22:56] the word comes by somebody the once the
[1:22:58] word it's going to pull you in a
[1:23:01] direction and divide the light from the
[1:23:04] darkness where you're walking in the
[1:23:06] midst of Darkness but it's not with you
[1:23:08] brother random says he separated the
[1:23:10] light from the darkness and the light he
[1:23:12] called day the darkness he called nights
[1:23:15] and God's word always separates the
[1:23:18] light from the darkness he says see it's
[1:23:21] the word that does the separating the
[1:23:24] light from the darkness so you don't
[1:23:26] gotta worry about being a good Christian
[1:23:28] you don't got to worry about making a
[1:23:31] Rapture but once you receive the light
[1:23:33] it pushes everything out of it you know
[1:23:37] brother Branham says she don't got to
[1:23:38] teach a boy to lie it's just in its
[1:23:40] nature it's a lie you don't got to teach
[1:23:42] your boy to steal it's in his nature to
[1:23:44] steal and you don't got to teach
[1:23:46] somebody to be an invincible Army once
[1:23:49] they receive the light it just becomes
[1:23:51] who they are
[1:23:53] Abraham wasn't the one that changed his
[1:23:56] body he just received the words and thy
[1:23:59] word changed his body come on somebody
[1:24:01] you don't got to worry about them you're
[1:24:04] just resting in an assurance of what the
[1:24:07] light says but you see before the Duke
[1:24:10] and Sparkle like I said earlier the
[1:24:12] darkness has to be pushed away so before
[1:24:15] you can manifest the LIE of the power of
[1:24:18] the light Darkness has to be pushed away
[1:24:21] but the random says when he gets ready
[1:24:23] to leave or to use a group of people he
[1:24:26] has to separate the light from the
[1:24:28] darkness when he gets ready to use an
[1:24:31] individual he separates the light from
[1:24:33] the darkness see light comes from God
[1:24:36] remember the light come by his spoken
[1:24:39] word he says the word of God commanded
[1:24:42] to clear the sky so the sons could shine
[1:24:45] in and his word today clears back all of
[1:24:49] the atmospheres of unbelief so that you
[1:24:52] can Shine the Light his word is shy is
[1:24:55] pushing back all of the atmospheres of
[1:24:58] unbelief remember the bubbling brook for
[1:25:00] the praying him says he would walk by
[1:25:01] the Brook and no matter the season uh
[1:25:04] the seasons of the of the country he
[1:25:06] says it can be winter spring fall summer
[1:25:08] whenever it was it was always bubbling
[1:25:11] and he says he went to the brook and he
[1:25:13] says how come you're always bubbling and
[1:25:16] he says is it because the uh that the
[1:25:18] squirrels shrink from him he says if the
[1:25:20] brook will talk he would say no not
[1:25:23] because squirrels drink from me is that
[1:25:25] because the birds shrink from you he
[1:25:27] says no that's not the reason he says is
[1:25:29] it because me the prophet of man drinks
[1:25:32] from you he says no that's not the
[1:25:35] reason he says how come time you're
[1:25:37] always so bubbly he says it's because
[1:25:39] there's something on the inside pushing
[1:25:42] it out the screen's gonna have to worry
[1:25:44] about pushing it up there was a source
[1:25:48] on the inside that was pushing it out
[1:25:50] and this pride has a source on the
[1:25:54] inside that is shining the light in the
[1:25:56] midst of darkness in the midst of Chaos
[1:25:59] in the midst of discouragement in the
[1:26:01] middle of Trials the pride is expressing
[1:26:04] the power of the Sun
[1:26:07] Hallelujah they're expressing a living
[1:26:10] God in the middle of a generation that
[1:26:13] don't know what to believe they don't
[1:26:15] know if the boys if they're girls they
[1:26:17] don't know what they are but they're
[1:26:19] somebody that knows the Living God that
[1:26:21] can save that can feel but the holy
[1:26:24] ghost that can heal somebody and free
[1:26:26] them from addictions they know who they
[1:26:29] are
[1:26:30] big pause of an insight
[1:26:34] it's pushing it out circumstances can't
[1:26:37] put the sled out tribulations can't put
[1:26:40] it out there's an unquenchable fire that
[1:26:43] is on the inside that are shining the
[1:26:45] light in the midst of chaos I just love
[1:26:48] this scripture in second Corinthians 4
[1:26:51] and 6 for God who commanded the light to
[1:26:55] shine out of Darkness commanded he
[1:26:58] didn't say please starkness let the
[1:27:01] light shine he commanded with authority
[1:27:04] no butts about it no ends about no maybe
[1:27:07] so but God who commanded the light to
[1:27:10] shine out of Darkness
[1:27:13] so in the midst of Darkness there come a
[1:27:16] light
[1:27:17] no Hallelujah in the midst of the
[1:27:20] darkness there come a light and that
[1:27:23] same God that same God has commanded
[1:27:26] light to shine in our hearts
[1:27:29] to give the light of knowledge of the
[1:27:32] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:27:34] for we have this treasure in Earth and
[1:27:37] vessels that the Excellence say of the
[1:27:39] power might be of God and not of us so
[1:27:43] he's saying the same power the pushed
[1:27:46] back for Darkness was because of the
[1:27:48] authority of the word and that is the
[1:27:51] same treasure that we have in this
[1:27:53] certain vessels that push the darkness
[1:27:56] out it's not us but there's the power of
[1:27:59] the light in us that is pushing it out
[1:28:02] and then he says this we're traveled on
[1:28:04] every side yet not distressed we're
[1:28:07] perplexed but not in despair persecuted
[1:28:10] but not forsaken cast down but not
[1:28:14] destroyed he's letting you know in the
[1:28:17] middle of the light there's nothing that
[1:28:19] can put the light out
[1:28:21] you may be persecuted but you're not
[1:28:24] forsaken you may be troubled on every
[1:28:26] side but you're not distressed you may
[1:28:30] be middle in the middle of a complex but
[1:28:32] the light is still shining you may be in
[1:28:35] the middle of a discouraging time but
[1:28:37] the light is still shining you've got a
[1:28:40] treasure in the earth and vessel that is
[1:28:43] shining the light expressing the power
[1:28:46] Hallelujah in the midst of a total
[1:28:49] blackout God has a like
[1:28:52] better Shining
[1:28:54] that is expressing itself Psalms 18 and
[1:28:57] 28 for thou will light my candle the
[1:29:00] Lord my God will Enlighten my darkness
[1:29:03] that's powerful the Lord my God will
[1:29:06] Enlighten my darkness yeah I hope this
[1:29:09] is okay you might be in the hardest time
[1:29:11] in your life you might be fighting the
[1:29:14] biggest doubles of your life but there's
[1:29:16] a light that can Enlighten the darkness
[1:29:18] condemnation Temptations complexes
[1:29:21] anxiety depression nervousness there's
[1:29:25] the lights that can Enlighten your
[1:29:27] Darkness
[1:29:28] Psalms 119 105 Thy word is the lamp
[1:29:30] under my feet in the light under my path
[1:29:34] we've hated to The Watchmen and now
[1:29:37] we're relying on his spiritual insights
[1:29:39] brother the Bible says that they come up
[1:29:42] they come to him you notice how the
[1:29:44] Bible's putting that it ain't him
[1:29:46] chasing them and saying hey morning
[1:29:48] cometh but the night does also they're
[1:29:50] coming to the Watchmen and saying
[1:29:52] Watchmen what of the night Watchmen what
[1:29:56] of the night and the Bible says the
[1:29:59] morning cometh but also the night for
[1:30:02] the prayer is saying that that means
[1:30:04] mourning is coming but it's still a
[1:30:06] night season so obey the Watchmen
[1:30:10] listen to the warnings he was letting
[1:30:13] them know that hey morning is coming but
[1:30:16] we're still in darkness you're gonna
[1:30:18] listen for my warnings you still gotta
[1:30:21] listen to my insight till morning comes
[1:30:24] hey come on somebody whereas one day
[1:30:27] we're gonna step out of the start the
[1:30:29] dimension and step into a body change
[1:30:31] step into the Rapture but until then
[1:30:34] it's still a night season
[1:30:37] there's still Darkness all around us you
[1:30:39] still gotta listen to the insights that
[1:30:42] God has given us the Bible says in first
[1:30:45] Timothy 1-13 hold fast the form of sound
[1:30:49] words this ain't time to throw the
[1:30:51] message away at this same time they'll
[1:30:54] turn away but this is the time to
[1:30:56] embrace the message embrace the likes in
[1:30:59] the midst of Darkness first
[1:31:01] Thessalonians 5 and 21 prove all things
[1:31:04] hold fast that which is good prove all
[1:31:07] things if you need to study the message
[1:31:09] study it out but prove it then once you
[1:31:12] prove it embrace it hold fast to that
[1:31:16] which is good hey if Creeds ain't lining
[1:31:19] up with the scriptures throw them out if
[1:31:21] man's ideas ain't lining up with
[1:31:24] scriptures throw it out if message
[1:31:26] preachers ain't lining up with
[1:31:27] scriptures throw it out but embrace the
[1:31:30] form of sound Words which is the the
[1:31:34] insight for the bride which is the LIE
[1:31:36] right
[1:31:38] Hallelujah embrace it but the Brandon
[1:31:41] says that ministers will look back and
[1:31:44] see what Moody said and what Sankey said
[1:31:46] that's where the son was but he is here
[1:31:49] today here is where he's at today it's
[1:31:53] on the west coast in the evening time
[1:31:55] Hallelujah giving evening lights not
[1:31:58] back to Luther's
[1:31:59] justification or Wesley sanctification
[1:32:02] but we're at the last day amen where the
[1:32:05] evening lights are shining we were at
[1:32:08] the last day follow
[1:32:09] the Sun
[1:32:11] so we're not doing away with Luther's
[1:32:14] message or Wesley's message but we're
[1:32:16] adding two and we're building upon the
[1:32:18] foundation you see to do away with
[1:32:21] Luther's message is for nowhere to say
[1:32:23] we don't need our for Moses to say we
[1:32:26] don't need Noah's message no will work
[1:32:29] for that day but it was another time
[1:32:31] another day with another message Moses
[1:32:35] couldn't go to the go to Egypt and build
[1:32:37] an ark and say come on let's go that
[1:32:40] wasn't the message for that day he
[1:32:42] wasn't doing away with that but that
[1:32:44] wasn't working for today oh come on now
[1:32:48] you see they wouldn't have been there if
[1:32:50] it wasn't for the ark
[1:32:52] okay come on somebody Moses went and
[1:32:55] been there with the staff if it wasn't
[1:32:56] for the ark so the ark had its purpose
[1:32:59] but it wasn't working for today we want
[1:33:03] to be here in the fullness of the light
[1:33:05] with our Luther's message
[1:33:07] come on somebody we want to be here in
[1:33:10] the wholeness of the light without
[1:33:12] Wesley's message but that message will
[1:33:16] not work for today hey Jesus wouldn't
[1:33:18] have been there with the Moses message
[1:33:20] but that message wasn't working for that
[1:33:24] day if they're following me it's a
[1:33:26] progression it's a life that's getting
[1:33:28] brighter and brighter and prior to the
[1:33:30] children of Israel couldn't stop after
[1:33:33] the first sign and say that's great
[1:33:34] let's make Camp know they were still
[1:33:37] needing to go on after they got on the
[1:33:39] other side of the Red Sea they couldn't
[1:33:41] stop and say Yep this is where we're
[1:33:43] staying oh the pillar of fire was still
[1:33:46] moving the lights was still getting
[1:33:48] brighter but it took the signs to get
[1:33:51] across the Red Sea and took getting
[1:33:53] across the Red Sea to get to the
[1:33:55] promised land come on now we needed
[1:33:58] Wesley we need a Luther we need a
[1:34:00] Pentecost but we've got the word now
[1:34:02] that has been built off of those stages
[1:34:05] so that you can walk in the fullness and
[1:34:09] live in the promised land live with your
[1:34:11] inheritance and believe that the same
[1:34:14] God that was with Wesley was with Luther
[1:34:16] and was with Pentecost and it's with
[1:34:19] this bride
[1:34:21] Hallelujah you say they couldn't have
[1:34:24] the promised land it's not of Egypt but
[1:34:27] it took that first stage to get him out
[1:34:29] of Egypt they turn again on the promised
[1:34:32] land if they stayed up the Red Sea let
[1:34:34] the rest he pushed them on towards the
[1:34:36] promised land but you can't stay in the
[1:34:39] wilderness either they're in the border
[1:34:41] between I hope this is okay this morning
[1:34:43] there was on the border between the Red
[1:34:46] Sea and the promised land and many
[1:34:48] people get stuck between the Holy Ghost
[1:34:51] Pentecost and the fullness of the word
[1:34:53] in order to come into the inheritance
[1:34:56] you gotta cross that border
[1:34:59] come on somebody you gotta cross that
[1:35:01] border it's a stepping stone
[1:35:04] the step into the fullness where you can
[1:35:07] have your inheritance what is your
[1:35:10] inheritance brother Josh it's your
[1:35:11] rapture it's the body change it's what
[1:35:14] we're believing for but it can only
[1:35:16] happen once you step across the border
[1:35:20] y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:35:22] the children of Israel that wandered
[1:35:24] around in their Wilderness for 20 years
[1:35:26] after 40 years I believe they wandered
[1:35:28] around wandered around because they
[1:35:30] didn't want to go across and fight in
[1:35:32] that land they got complacent it was
[1:35:35] easier staying there because they didn't
[1:35:37] want to fight the criticism
[1:35:38] I'm preaching this morning they didn't
[1:35:40] want to fight the unbelief they didn't
[1:35:42] want to fight but there was a Joshua and
[1:35:44] Caleb that says we're not here this
[1:35:46] ain't the end of the road this ain't why
[1:35:49] we was brought out of Egypt that's why
[1:35:52] we was brought out of Egypt come on
[1:35:54] somebody God has brought you this far
[1:35:57] not to leave you here take another step
[1:36:00] God brought you out of your traditions
[1:36:03] for this God brought you out of your
[1:36:05] ideas and those other things for this
[1:36:09] don't stay on the border cross the line
[1:36:14] Hallelujah Joshua and Caleb says I don't
[1:36:17] care what we gotta face he brought us
[1:36:20] this far and I'm stepping across that's
[1:36:23] my Promised Land that's my inheritance
[1:36:26] that's who I am that's why I was built
[1:36:28] for I was built to possess my land I
[1:36:32] wasn't built to be defeated in the
[1:36:34] wilderness come on now you wasn't built
[1:36:36] to be defeated in confusion you wasn't
[1:36:39] built to be defeated in the Reds here
[1:36:42] you was made to dwell in the heights of
[1:36:45] this message you was to where you were
[1:36:47] us made to dwell and the powers
[1:36:51] of your inheritance
[1:36:52] you see brother Branham says John the
[1:36:54] Baptist was a little light but then
[1:36:57] there come a greater light after him and
[1:36:59] he says once the greater Light Came
[1:37:01] Luther John the Baptist lights went out
[1:37:04] but the random says John the Baptist was
[1:37:06] the light of the hour he was the light
[1:37:08] before Jesus was the light the prophet
[1:37:11] Isaiah said a voice of one crying in the
[1:37:14] wilderness prepare the way of the Lord
[1:37:16] make straight his path that was spoken
[1:37:19] of that that was the spoken word of God
[1:37:20] he was laying there it hadn't come to
[1:37:23] life yet Malachi the last prophet 400
[1:37:26] years before it had taken place so
[1:37:28] behold I will send my messenger before
[1:37:31] my foot before me to prepare the way of
[1:37:34] the Lord here he come out of the
[1:37:36] Wilderness without a denomination
[1:37:38] without a Creed without an
[1:37:39] identification but the lights identified
[1:37:42] him the word identified him so you're
[1:37:46] saying that John the Baptist had light
[1:37:48] absolutely just like Luther had liked
[1:37:51] but they couldn't stay around John the
[1:37:53] Baptist a greater light had come you
[1:37:56] notice that only two of John the Baptist
[1:37:58] disciples ran after Jesus
[1:38:01] the rest of them stayed with John
[1:38:04] because what's the Bible say John was in
[1:38:06] prison and the Bible says he sent his
[1:38:09] disciples to go talk to Jesus and ask
[1:38:11] him are you the one or the way he looked
[1:38:14] to or we look for another are you the
[1:38:16] Messiah so John still had disciples that
[1:38:19] refused to go with Jesus
[1:38:21] come on somebody you can be in the light
[1:38:24] of yesterday but there's a greater life
[1:38:27] that is here
[1:38:30] but the Branham continues on to say
[1:38:31] Jesus said you did walk in his light he
[1:38:35] was a bright and Shining Light for a
[1:38:37] while why until the way was prepared
[1:38:40] then his lights went out you can't walk
[1:38:43] in that light you Baptist that is this
[1:38:46] is the light of the hour the light has
[1:38:48] come Rise and Shine the word the light
[1:38:50] the word manifested is the word of God
[1:38:54] identified is the light God need a light
[1:38:58] throughout the church ages but those
[1:39:00] lights went out just like the children
[1:39:02] of Israel the brother Branham says when
[1:39:04] they come to the Red Sea they would make
[1:39:06] camp but once the pillar of fire moved
[1:39:08] they packed up and went with it they
[1:39:11] couldn't stay at that present stage they
[1:39:13] had to pack up and go with him and we
[1:39:16] know what happened throughout the church
[1:39:17] ages they denominated the Next
[1:39:19] Generation denominated and the spirit of
[1:39:21] God the purifier the light moved on
[1:39:23] moved on to uh to Wesley and the Next
[1:39:26] Generation denominated you see if Wesley
[1:39:28] was here today he'll be be preaching
[1:39:30] this message
[1:39:32] he would be beef Luther was here today
[1:39:34] he would be preaching this message he
[1:39:37] was a Seer he was one that could see the
[1:39:40] light for the arrow
[1:39:42] but it was the Next Generation that
[1:39:45] refused to go with the light
[1:39:48] Hallelujah but we're living in a
[1:39:50] generation that is dwelling in the light
[1:39:52] and we're the generation of serpent
[1:39:55] bruisers
[1:39:56] that is defeating every Spirit brother
[1:39:58] Branham says he is the light the truth
[1:40:00] the light there was no dark darkness in
[1:40:02] him he says he is absolutely the light
[1:40:05] oh hey absolutely the lightning the time
[1:40:07] of Darkness yes all of these false
[1:40:09] glares and things were fade away yes sir
[1:40:12] he is here don't fear turn on the lights
[1:40:15] his promised word notice how he says
[1:40:18] that you've got to turn on the lights so
[1:40:20] the light is here we have power here we
[1:40:22] have light switches we have the Wafers
[1:40:24] up but in order to see the lights you
[1:40:26] got to turn it on the power can be here
[1:40:28] the light is here but you've got to
[1:40:30] operate it you've got to all pray for
[1:40:33] message but God has given you look how
[1:40:35] II Peter 1 and 12. there were therefore
[1:40:37] I will be not I will not be negligent to
[1:40:40] put you always in remembrance of these
[1:40:42] things that ye know them and be
[1:40:44] established in present truth be
[1:40:47] established you look at Ephesians 2 and
[1:40:50] 19. now therefore you are no more
[1:40:52] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:40:55] citizens with the Saints and of the
[1:40:57] household of God and are built upon the
[1:40:59] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:41:03] and like I was mentioning about the
[1:41:05] curtain of time brother Branham they
[1:41:07] come up too many and they said Paul's
[1:41:08] going to be judged or he says you're
[1:41:10] going to be judged for what you preached
[1:41:13] and he says well will Paul be judged for
[1:41:15] what he preached and they said yes he
[1:41:17] will and he says oh good for I just
[1:41:19] preached what Paul preached so he was
[1:41:21] bringing us back to the foundation of
[1:41:24] the Apostles as the musicians come
[1:41:28] we've been promised a Watchman in this
[1:41:30] last day I will send you Elijah the
[1:41:33] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:41:35] and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall
[1:41:36] turn the hearts of the fathers of the
[1:41:37] children
[1:41:38] hearts of the children to the fathers it
[1:41:41] was an Insight that come to a generation
[1:41:44] to bring him back to the foundation of
[1:41:48] the Apostles
[1:41:50] one more quote brother random says he
[1:41:52] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:41:54] spirit saith unto the churches he that
[1:41:56] happened here let him heal up the spirit
[1:41:58] every Church age at the end of it he
[1:42:01] would say he that I think let him hear
[1:42:03] what the spirit saith to the church ages
[1:42:05] we're not following a man it's the
[1:42:08] spirit that come throughout the church
[1:42:10] ages
[1:42:11] and the ones that had an ear to hear
[1:42:13] once they had an insight to see grab the
[1:42:16] hold of it and said this is my lights
[1:42:18] but now it's your time to grab it it's
[1:42:21] your turn to embrace the watchman's
[1:42:23] warning
[1:42:24] just like the watchmans throughout the
[1:42:26] Old Testament had an obligation to let
[1:42:28] the people know then it was the people's
[1:42:31] obligation to embrace me to embrace it
[1:42:33] we've held a Watchman in this generation
[1:42:36] he fulfilled his calling he fulfilled
[1:42:39] his obligation but now it's up to you
[1:42:41] and I right he that happened here let
[1:42:44] him hear he says how tragic is it that
[1:42:47] this first age did not listen to the
[1:42:49] spirit instead listen to a man but thank
[1:42:52] God in the last age there will be a
[1:42:54] group of people rise up the trooper the
[1:42:57] true Bride of the last day she will
[1:43:00] listen to the spirit in the day of gross
[1:43:02] Darkness the lights will return by the
[1:43:05] pure
[1:43:06] and will return to the power of
[1:43:09] Pentecost
[1:43:10] and welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:14] must the Bible say the spirit on the
[1:43:16] bride say
[1:43:19] they're in unison
[1:43:20] they're agreeing with it they've got the
[1:43:22] same insights
[1:43:24] amen let's bear our hitch tonight
[1:43:27] their gracious Heavenly Father
[1:43:29] Lord thank you for this opportunity Lord
[1:43:33] thank you for the Insight that you've
[1:43:35] given us father
[1:43:36] you've given us a message Lord that's
[1:43:38] lifted us up out of Darkness
[1:43:40] Lord has pushed back past the unbelief
[1:43:43] in our lives Lord we couldn't believe
[1:43:46] for a Rapture because of the darkness
[1:43:48] we couldn't believe for a body change
[1:43:50] because of the darkness we couldn't
[1:43:52] believe it Lord because of all the
[1:43:53] unbelief
[1:43:55] but she sent a light the pushed past all
[1:43:58] the darkness so that we can believe for
[1:44:00] the impossible Lord if there's somebody
[1:44:03] here Lord
[1:44:04] that is in discouragement May the light
