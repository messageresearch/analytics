around here and um amen been uh thankful for all of the wonderful reports of what the Lord is doing um through their ministry as they're out uh ministering string and and so we're we're so thankful so thankful for that amen we want to look here Psalms 63 and 1 praise the Lord says oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen in thy Sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live and I will lift up mine hands in thy name thy Soul shall be my soul shall be satisfied as with moral and fatness and my mouth shall sing praise uh shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I Rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall be into the Lord parts of the earth they shall fall By The Sword and they uh they shall be a portion for foxes Let's uh go to the Lord in prayer here today Lord Jesus we thank you for all that you are and Lord as as our desire is for your word to have its uh proper effect Upon Our Lives Lord we know that it it requires your presence and we're asking Lord that your presence would would just be so sweet Among Us Lord as we feel you here tonight and that you would cause that that word uh to be germinated by your Holy Spirit Lord that you would bring Victory and healing and encouragement and most importantly draw us closer to you we thank you Lord for the wonderful testimony of an Hani today Lord as she has been believing for you and and for you to come Lord and ignite that faith and bring about the reality of what she's Lord been waiting for father we thank you for that now Lord we're asking that you would do the same for so many others Lord that you would lift us up into your presence tonight and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless bless you you may be seated here this evening amen I I want to minister this evening on the renewing of the soul and um amen as we have just read this this Psalm amen I uh he says my soul followeth hard after thee and thy right hand upholdeth me and when you find rest for your souls amen that's there's something about that amen there's there's no more struggle because your soul has found its anchor in the Lord Jesus Christ amen the soul is is when that soul is positioned in the word amen it is the same as as the as Israel being positioned in that promised land and and so we're we're thankful uh uh for that here tonight that the word that God has given us in this day amen the restoration of the word that the soul has found its anchor we have been placed we're no longer torn from Pillar To Post we're we're no longer uh struggling to identify with who we are we are the sons and daughters of God and there's something about when that Soul Finds Its rest in in in Christ the struggle is gone amen the struggle is over it's uh amen it's not laboring anymore it is it is found its rest and therefore the word has its perfect work in you you're no longer working it but the word is being worked through the life of God in that Soul now I I want before we get into the renewing of the soul I want us to to to to just briefly look at that because the in there is a a difference in the intellectual faith and the Soul Faith the intellectual Faith amen it can intellectually um adapt to the structure of of its environment amen whether it it be Judaism or whether it be um you know um Hamad uh uh whatever that amen that other religion is that you know where you where they they they have um the their prophet and and you you've got you've got the different religions and then you've got within the in the Christian realm you've got the all these denominations that you that that you would uh uh follow after and and you adapt to certain uh mindsets you adapt to certain structures and so amen but this is not what the what the Lord had in mind God does not want you int intellectually adapting to to the dress code and the or the tithes and the offerings or church attendance or uh your devotions you see this can all be done in the psyche it can all be it it's all right here in the mind amen but it it it's just a mental format and and and sooner or later it's going to start questioning and it'll question this and that and amen and and and so it is all done without relationship so you can do all of this and not have relationship because relationship can only come through the soul amen that is what is created in the image of God and so so the soul is all about relationship it's not about laws it's not about structure it's about relationship amen this is where God comes and fellowships with his sons and daughters this th this soul is where the Cravings come for fellowshipping God because once you ever come in fellowship with God and you've come into the realities of the promises of God Amen that's all you want that's all you long for is the presence of the Lord now brother brother bradam would say Amen uh and he would tell us why why people so tossed about and he would he would he would give the you know saying I I wonder what is lack in in people amen uh and then and then he would say it's very simple they've never gone all the way they never went all the way into that most holy place and he and he deals with the outer courts and then the the the holy place and then the most holy place and he and he talks about how amen intellectually they can accept Christ but but you've got to go into that inner Court into that most holy place there is where God comes down and supernaturally visits with his believer that's where God comes down in communes and fellowships the great Pillar of Fire coming down and there's where things really happen Amen in the first two courts it's human ability amen it's humans giving sacrifice and it's humans taking care of the altar then you go in and it's a human putting oil in the lamps and a human keeping the the amen the the fire lit but when you get into the inner Court when you get into the most holy place it's you setting their resting and it's God coming down and making you to live it's God coming in and amen and and and and and and giving life to the shoe bread and giving life to the to to Aaron's Rod it's it is is nothing you have no part in that at all it's all God Amen and so that's that is where the soul is amen you've got the body you've got the spirit which is the mind and then you've got the soul and the soul is where you and God Fellowship now now brother bradam would say he says you find them people who who seem to be very religious seem to have uh such a deep desire daily they search and hunt and seek for God never come to any kind of a settlement of any kind to where they could ever be settled and anchored in Christ this I have learn to be an experience that this is people of intellectuals and speaking this there's two different types of Christianity it seems strange but I but I will not say two types I I will say two uh different phases would be a better word to use not types but phases the Christianity but two phases of it amen one of them is intellectual a mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart and and the one is intellectually hungry he is feasting on God but his Feast doesn't hold out the other one seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing bothers them they're just as solid and anchored as they can be there's no trials no storms bothers them at all they but but they seem to have something about them that people uh uh who are Christians and trying to live for God admire that type of a Christian I've often wondered Lord what is it these people have that others crave so much yet seem to fail to get it he goes on and says and finding it so simple in the word of God we Tred to explain it and in order now to do this after seeing the intellectual part of the Mind the soul which is in the heart the mind and the Soul which is in the heart amen you truly have two different mental faculties you have one of them in your head by your brain and the others operated in your heart which is called your soul your spirit and your soul now they're very much in disagreement many times when the head seems to say something the soul wonders at it as if it's not right and when it comes into the soul the head seems to step back and there's been things that's happened to you that you knew was going to be yet you could not explain why there's no reason you couldn't explain it out but you just accepted it and it just happened that way and that's something that happens way down in here can you say amen so the soul is is right at home in the presence of God Amen now your mind is not always comfortable with the presence of God but your soul is right at home amen your mind you're you you you can you can be in a good church service and enjoying it and then your mind is saying it's getting late amen we need to go uh I I need to go to work in the morning oh the kids have got to get to bed and and amen but but if you would let your soul continue your soul is enjoying the presence of God Amen so the mind is in direct conflict it's Amen it doesn't that the spirit of the Lord will move upon you to Amen to to uh you know just come on you to give a $100 to a brother in the church and your mind is saying you do that you're walking to work all week amen and and and then there's a struggle that goes on in between God can deal with you in your soul but your mind does not always agree with that can you say amen amen so so when we look at this Amen brother brother bradam would say trying to do something these these classes they try to say themselves each one Amen in that intellectual class they go to church every Sunday that's very good I want to be religious that's very good they they still under under the law but by when by the other by going to church and doing good is not something that you do yourself it's something in you that is doing it for you the holy spirit in your heart so both of them go to church both of them but one is by law and rigid and after a while amen is that that that person it just it's just not as it's not as real to them but the one who is in fellowship with God communion with God church becomes something that is not law or legal it becomes something that we long for we want in our lives it's that it's that new birth on the inside of us and there is a relationship with you and God can you say amen he says in this inner Court these people that live inside he says they seem to always be fed up always feeling good Ezekiel says I will write my laws a new in their heart amen where the law where did the law used to be on stones in the ark and the Ark represents the heart this I will put my law in their heart in that Ark amen the heart is the abold of God oh hallelujah amen he says the Old Testament God dwelt In His glory over the ark and the AR heart is the ark God dwells not in the head in the heart God is not known by theology he is not known by mental conception God is known by an oldfashioned Sanctified Born Again experience that comes in that human heart heart oh Hallelujah can you say amen he says now yet men and women live a good life and love God by mental conception but the real hiding place is in the heart hid with Christ amen I now we're going to preach on renewing here tonight that soul that soul is where it's at that soul is where God visits that soul is where amen Eternal desires are met that soul is where genuine rest is at amen that soul is where every man and woman amen there is where we fellowship with God Amen when Christ the holy spirit in your heart he is in you with your temperament he's living his own life to his own will through you Hallelujah know that sounds awful but it's right Christ you're so yielded you are that Christ speaks the kind of words he would speak and he thinks the kind of thoughts that he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting what a beautiful picture of a consecrated Christian yielded and Christ working through no Struggle No work no labor it is just Christ Living himself through you why because he's found your soul and your soul is content with him amen now the mind will never allow that it'll always be a struggle you'll always be amen counteracting God's word you'll always amen be and and God can't use you that way amen although he you you you're a good man a good Christian a good this or that but God wants you to enter into his rest where he does the labor and you do the resting well that sounds like a deal to me let him do the working and I do the yielding let him do the fulfilling and I do the believing let him do the healing and I'm just here Amen to believe every word that he has promised and that's the way we receive any promise of God we're not struggling he's doing the work we are resting Hallelujah he says Paul amen said to me to uh to me to live is Christ and to die is gain not me that liveth anymore but Christ liveth in me Christ Living in the individual so surrendered when Christ speaks through the lips thinks through the Mind sees Through The Eyes acts through the temperament Hallelujah then the things of the world is passed away how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time it's Christ has control amen you see it you that's what it is it's Christ in you Christ in you he says again amen well you say well I I believe that to be the truth brother brandom amen that's right it's in there but but it has to be here if it is then your whole makeup is Christ your attitude your desires your appetite your everything is Christ yielded and there he goes again resting everything perfect I'm still talking a little bit on resting here tonight I I want my soul to be at rest I want oh in the midst of the storm to be able to Amen to call Leo the Lion over there and lay down on on on my problem and rest amen right there where no matter where I'm at whether I'm in the Lion's Den or the or the fiery furnace or amen I don't care where I'm at Lord let me have rest no matter what the situation is believing in you well Hallelujah glory to God Amen how how are you defeating the enemy because you have yielded and found rest and you have allowed Christ to fight through you you're not trying to figure out how you're going to get healed you're not trying to figure out how your CH your sons or daughters are going to be saved all you're doing is just believing and thanking God and confessing that it's going to be done let God do the hard work I don't know how he's going to save your son or your daughter I don't know how he's going to bring them in but I promise you this one thing here amen if he's doing the work and not you then it's going to come to pass amen and he's going to get all the glory and you're going to do all the resting can you say amen amen oh yes in his fell in his presence is fellowship in his presence is joy in his presence is growth in his presence is resting in well praise the Lord I say growing not manufacturing I say resting not trying to figure it out amen hallelujah brother Brenham says Christianity is not something you know God's not not one that uh God is not one you have to beg and cry and plead and fast and starve everything like that to get it to get to certainly not amen he goes on and says but then but in the grace God has given to us freely as we have need everything that we have need of Amen I noticed up in Michigan you you people here can can brag a lot because you have a lot of fruit you've got you we we get grapes from michig we get cherries from Michigan amen the big beings and and all kinds be beautiful I think there's not a place in the world grows them any better than Michigan a and and now you ought to understand what your fruit trees are did you ever know that that little cherry or little apple tree when you set it out it's no bigger than than about a half inch tall that that that every bushel of apples that you'll ever collect off that tree is in it right then oh that just makes me want to shout amen I I I was looking the other night as as as we were preaching there in Claremore and I and I I seen that beautiful group of young people and uh I I was preaching a little on a on on the godhead and amen and how uh that God came to redeem you God came looking for you amen that this isn't a religious Affair this is all as I've said it several times amen this is about a king and some Prince Amen in the beginning it was a king king and a prince and his wife it was it was Authority and Dominion ship and it's God bringing us back to that and and I look there at sister Isabelle and amen and and I seen her sister fixing to get married and fixing to get baptized they were fixed to get baptized and and they were amen and and and and just seeing that group and I and I was and I was telling them it's it's not what you can do here the object is is God cleansing you God coming out of the invisible he came down in the body of Jesus Christ the Redeemer so that he could pay the price so that he could come on down and live his life in you oh that's what he wants he wants no Struggle No struggle if you ever get the life of God in you I don't care whether you're one of the kids here on the front row that's been filled with the Holy Ghost every Miracle every amen Act of power every sit every hallelujah amen all that God's ever going to do through you is is already laying inside of you right now present tense through that seed that is in you oh can you say amen amen it's already in it amen now he says he says U uh uh uh he says if it isn't then then where does it come from who hangs it on there it's already in it the only thing the little tree does you just set it out and water it and it has to drink and drink until it gets so much and then it goes to pushing out it drinks some more amen drinks more than it's a lotted portion it swells out it pushes out limbs it pushes out buds it pushes out leaves then it blossoms then apples then it pushes again and it pushes again just keeps drinking drinking drinking till it just pushes out and that's the way the Christian does when you're planted in Christ Jesus everything you have need of in this Earth's journey I want to shout right now is in you when you receive the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen so what are you doing you are fellowshipping that now this is where the Christian experience is lacking today is because we've got so much other things to keep us busy and we miss out on the relationship if you're going to produce the apples you've got to drink the water can you say Amen now when you do if you don't then you're going back mentally amen you're coming to church mentally you're going you're doing the things mentally God does not want this to be religion he wants this to be relationship relationship produces Life religion produces ritual amen relationship is where God comes to meet with his sons and daughters oh Hallelujah aren't you glad for that tonight amen relationship God wants to fellowship with you amen he says now when you're planted in Christ everything you have need of is is in you the only thing you have to do drink drink push out push out just drink till you have to just drink out till you can't drink no more if you need Divine Healing go to God's word and drink from it until you push out if you need if you need more of God keep drinking and pushing out Christ is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life if you're planted in him the only thing you have to do is drink of his goodness and push out whatever you have need of in this life's journey it is all somebody say it with me drinking resting and peace now that's exactly what brother brandom said let's say it again it's all drinking resting and peace drinking resting and peace amen that's what God is look just drinking of his promises relationship with God Amen just a wonderful Fellowship there is something about the soul that is craving more of God feed your soul with more of God hallelujah it's not he says it's not what you struggle and strive and pull at you defeat the very purpose that you're representing when you do that now so what is the secret brother brandham says it's very simple and you can find it in the Bible he says it is drinking fellowshipping it's that Soul you're giving that Soul what it's craving it's craving fellowship with God your mind don't want it your body don't want it but your soul well praise the Lord sometimes you can you can amen you just you just get all nervous you get up tight you wonder amen and and and and and so you know you'll put a little movie on or you'll you you'll you'll uh uh you you'll put a you know your you'll go and eat a nice big old steak or you amen but you find it's not really satisfying it's not taking care of it it's because there is God is wanting relationship with you can you say Amen what was what what how many believes that Israel there in Egypt and The Exodus was a type of this Exodus and what did they do amen when they found that God was blessing the children of Israel and they were multiplying amen what did Pharaoh do Pharaoh said they are they are they have too much time on their hands make them more busy amen and then they says we're not giving you bricks anymore to build now you're going to have to make your own bricks so then now now there's down the Slime pits trying to do and what were they doing God him so busy they didn't have time for prayer they didn't have time for family they didn't have time for victory they didn't have time for any of those things well can you say amen and that's what the devil wants to do with us today he wants to take your time because your soul needs that quality time with God Amen getting alone with God Amen it's like you're renewed in the it's a it's it's a renewing time for you

quiety quiet yourself amen just say Lord I'm here here I am I'm here to serve you I love you I know you will grant my request he says it's the Lord's desire to Fellowship but it does not please him amen when we're always in a hurry and excitable the spirit of the Lord don't like that at all well can you say amen amen so our Spirits we our our our our Spirits receive those vibrations amen which affects our soul amen sure it does your mind begins to affect those things your your spirit man you get all those vibrations going all the time with your phones and and and and and and and and and and movies and and I can't believe I I even say that but there's a you know the you know movies have crept into the church amen and so it doesn't do me any good to preach against the movies because you're going to watch them anyway so amen so what we try to say these days is you need to monitor those movies and you need to amen put the well some of you looking at me as if oh are you backsliding on us no the church has backslid we've been preaching against movies from the very beginning but it doesn't do no good so try to fast from those movies occasionally so the spirit of God can have its effect in our lives oh how did I stop here amen pull back from those phones pull back from those movies pull back from YouTube pull back from the from the internet pull back from those things get those things amen and quieten yourself down so that your soul can have relationship with God how many believes that's all right he said that's the reason that's the reason the spirit is not operating the church amen the way it is among the people is because there's a lot be a lot of it because of irreverence people don't respect it they don't respect anything that God says he says uh uh Peter and John passed into into the gate beautiful and and said look on us in other words give heed quieten your self look toward us all through the Bible it was respects amen let's give God the respect oh can you see man another place he says he says you're getting nervous just quieten yourself and say Lord I believe hallelujah what can you say amen amen he says it isn't if we fight and Pull and hurry oh if I don't get this and if I don't get that that's not it it's it's to know the law of life is inside you and you just let go and let God Amen then he takes you to your healing takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything else that he's promised any claim that he's given is yours by letting go and letting God oh I I I I feel good about right now amen it's already there it's already there it's already there let me quiet myself before the presence of God can you say amen amen now now God you you you understand what I'm saying amen now God's great great uh uh goal will never be defeated and I'm just going to let the devil know that right now if God's called you for a purpose and God's ordained you for a purpose amen and I believe he has amen he didn't put you in the justification season or the sanctification season or the 1906 baptism season he has placed you in the adoption Rapture season this is your season and I just want to let the devil know there is nothing that can Fort the purpose of God in God's people because they've got a soul that is going to hunger for God more than this flesh is hungering for sin and easy and pleasure amen there is a soul that is longing more for God how many believes that man how many can how many can give me a witness that amen you've made the money but it didn't satisfy how many can witness that you've you've had the nice things but it didn't satisfy you've had your popularity but it didn't satisfy you'll never be satisfied because you are a son of God Amen and the only thing that is ever going to satisfy you is not that new home home amen that you're that you're working so hard for not that new card it's not in the things amen the only thing that is going to satisfied the Bride of Jesus Christ is relationship and fellowship with God you communing with him and him communing with you there is where satisfaction comes from Brother brandom My Redeemer he says God's purpose can never be defeated someone say hallelujah there is nothing can defeat it how happy we ought to be this day resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there is neither things present or things to that can come there's no sickness there's no sorrow no death no pearls no nothing else can separate us from the purpose of the Living God Amen as I was preaching this morning amen it's it's it's with without the seed of promise there is no expectation amen and without expectation there is no preparation so what did God do God sent a prophet in this day amen to prepare your heart to give you the promise to tell you you're not one of them you're not the average girl you are the beautiful chosen bride of Jesus Christ you were predestinated for the throne God gave that promise to you amen and what is that promise doing it's creating expectation in your heart it's creating something within you every day that you live that God does want to fellowship with me that God does want to commune with me me that God does want to use me and anoint me it gives me an expectation therefore I prepare for that by entering into that secret place with God waiting somebody looked at your neighbor and says are you waiting amen yes waiting amen now here it is brother Brenham would say there is it is he's sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending Prophet after 2,000 years he's sending someone who is so far from organization and education and the world of religion that as John the Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear from God Amen uh and he will have thus saith the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouth P piece and he as it is declared in Malachi four and six will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back that elect of the last days and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul and he will resal restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works there is nothing can anal That Word of Promise to this bride amen [Applause] can you say Amen it's resting in him now it's not the resting in the Caribbeans it's not the resting in this no there's the there's the struggle according to uh Hebrews the fourth chapter there is a amen there there is a struggle to enter into that rest there's where Satan wants to get us but see amen there's where relationship amen that relationship with you and god that relationship that communion with that Soul you've been born again you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got the ability to hear from God hallelujah God talks to you on a regular basis basis I believe that I I believe God talks to all of his children on a regular basis I believe you I believe that your footsteps are ordered of the Lord I I believe that I believe there's times when you're discouraged and the Holy Spirit nudges your heart with a little scripture amen that's God talking to you amen when you're when you're feeling weary and tired and sick as an Angie was and then the spirit of the Lord just come down and make everything well in there a what what is it you young people amen you're fighting this and you're fighting that and that little nudge of the Holy Spirit coming down upon your heart amen what is that that is the living presence of God in you directing your paths but if we would recognize that and then communicate back with him and have that little time with him well praise the Lord can you say Amen now God's always going to have amen amen he says now he says we find that in the days the world was going to be destroyed by a flood but God made a preparation I just feel like I just feel bigger than I am right right now amen the in the days before the struggle before the the before the the condemnation and and and the ruination Of The World God made a preparation not Noah God made the preparation it was Noah's body Noah just found himself amen his soul soul surrendered with God he seen the vision loved the vision part of the vision and it was no struggle or work at all Noah was God was doing his work through that man now watch that he says then destroyed by the flood God made a preparation preparation for what cause to preserve his purpose that he did in the days of Noah and he's doing it today he has made a preparation to conserve or preserve or protect his own purpose he will conserve a church he will conserve a people he will will conserved subjects for his great domain that death cannot destroy and re we realize that it is by faith that we believe this but the re but but the resurrection produces a solid foundation on which our faith rest and nothing can destroy it see it's not here oh do you love him oh God's dream is coming true what I preached on this morning all of these dreams that God has had is coming true amen you can have God's had this expectation for a long time and we're having the same expectation we're going to the Lord in prayer and sometimes Satan battles us and fights us hard amen but I just want to tell you Hallelujah the presence of the almighty God is there to renew your soul he is expecting Sister Laura sent me a text this morning amen about a scripture that she was that came to REM mind as I was as as I was preaching amen that Christ is now seated expecting until all of his enemies amen are are are defeated he's he's he's expect he's dreaming he's looking he's he sees that in the future and he knows it's going to come to pass oh if you could just take the words of that Prophet that says nothing's going to stop it nothing's going to stop it nothing's going to stop your purpose nothing's going to defeat you you're going to make it that Soul has been equipped with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it shall [Applause] Prevail can you say amen amen what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there was no demon no power nothing to separate God's Immortal plan God's Immortal uh Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said what am I saying I I I am saying you are God's dream come true you as as I ministered a little bit on on on Boaz the other night and Ruth it wasn't a one-sided deal there was a reason that Boaz loved Ruth or that that that that that he was willing to do all that he'd done for Ruth because he was in love with her he was in love when the very wealthy man and that he's the next to Kin and and he's willing to take on the moabit amen that all the rest of the people hated that girl could rest because she has his heart Qui in your spirit little Ruth amen won't you go to Calvary where he laid down lay at his feet pull those skirts over you he skirt over you and say you're my redeemer and he looks back at you and says thou has given me more favor he's talking to her you have given me more favor in your life better in than you did even before by coming and willingly laying down I'm an old man and you're coming and laying down to amen by at my feet and asking amen for my favor are you hearing me I I I say I'm experiencing amen the place where he laid down because it was at that place that he redeemed me it was at that place that he laid amen his life down he paid the price for me it was at that place I am resting his holy spirit is over for me I'm no longer struggling I have found my position in him and I Know The Enemy don't like me I know the enemy is going to try amen to keep my spirit and my soul all stirred up but it's it doesn't matter he has already chosen me and I have accepted his love he's woing me he's drow me even with all the complexes and with all all of of the of the shortcomings and everything else this moabit is no longer a moabit I am a virtuous bride of Jesus Christ can you say amen amen amen he's seated he's resting he's expecting until his enemies become his foot stol well I'm going to enter into his rest I'm going to expect I'm going to believe that what he died for he will get everything that he died for how many believes that your God is big enough how many believes your your heavenly bridegroom is big enough Amen to give you everything that he died for man yes sir Hallelujah but sometimes sometimes we need to hear it from the Lord sometimes times sometimes we need to hear Boaz whisper in our ears and say I'm glad I married you I wouldn't have wanted anybody else but you some sometimes we just got to hear it from the Lord saying listen I'm not looking at all of your genetics and where you came from and all I I'm I'm looking for the girl that I got and I'm in love with you sometimes my wife needs to hear that from from me to say I love you I appreciate you sometimes what can you say man how many of you ladies like hearing that from your wives your your husbands not your wives your husbands saying I love you David needed that David needed to hear that DAV David was was one of the greatest psalmist amen the the the the the the great king of Israel that had so much promises given to him they would never lack that his son would rign on the throne amen forever but David in Psalms 42 and one he got so thirsty he couldn't go any further he says as the heart panth for the water Brook so panth my soul after thee Oh God my soul my soul you mean that that one that God is redeemed my soul is thirsty thirsty for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before my God you see there that predestinated soul is the means by which God is going to accomplish Lish his purpose remember what that quote that I read to you here a while back brother bradam says the Holy Spirit the the Holy Ghost baptism amen is is not uh uh H how did that go amen is is is not the most important thing he says it was your soul that was the most important thing because you can have the Holy Spirit resting over all the world but if they haven't got a soul but it's that predestinated soul that the Holy Spirit can come down upon can you say Amen my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God when I shall I come before my God mat tears have been my meat day and night now this is David he wear it when they continually say unto me where is your god when I remember these things I pour out my soul in me where i' had gone with a multitude I went with him to the house of God with a voice of joy and praise and with a m M itude they kept the holy day why art thou cast down on my soul why art thou disquieted in me hope thou and God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee in the land of Jordan the hermanides from the hill of Mazar deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy water sprouts and thy waves and thy Billows are going over me are are are are you are you catching it deep calling to deep there was there is a deep there's a supernatural God that is calling out to the supernatural Soul amen there is that great Eternal one that is calling to this and this soul is screaming out I must I know I'm I know that I'm in I I I'm in a web of of time I'm in a web of Amen family Affairs I'm in a web of having to go to the job I'm I'm in a web of all these things but yet the soul the soul is here with a purpose and this soul is screaming out I must come before my God it's the great Eternal one screaming out and it's your soul screaming back when we're out there in the woods you can hear the coyote when the sun's going down and you'll hear one coyote way over here and and then you'll hear way over here you'll hear another one before you know it and before you know it they're all around and they seem like they're getting closer and you're wondering what they're talking about hallelujah oh yes but it's the Deep calling to the Deep it's the light calling the like it's the like responding to the like it's the one nature it's it's it's the same nature it's it's all these voices all of the same nature that is that is crying back amen what is it it's a fellowship it's a communion oh if the sons of God the daughters of God in the building tonight could understand amen that God gave you that Soul oh don't be discouraged amen I God's not forsaken you you might be in the in the valley you might amen have all of Amen all you need is that quiet time with God that sweet time with the Lorden he says yet the Lord will command deep calleth to the Deep then the eth verse the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life now this is this goes Way Beyond the Mind folks I I I hope I hope I made that clear in the beginning see the mind is all structure mind is legalism amen but here here's a this is the this is the psalmist just being raw this is the psalmist being really raw I need my God this is not just a religious Affair I've got a craving for the most high God the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life and I will say unto God my rock why hast thou forgotten me why why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy as with a sword in my bones and my enemies reproach me as as they say daily where is thy God why art thou cast down oh my soul amen why art thou disquieting within me hope thou and God for yet I for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance in my God if the psalmist who walks so closely with the Lord was going through the valley it was not that God had forsaken him and it was that there was so much around him the web had spent that web and that web around me there was so much going on that it seemed like his Soul he couldn't he was having a hard time settling down his mind he was having a hard time settling down everything stopping everything so that he could commune with God God never leaves God never forsakes you say brother w we can't yes you can we got to we've got to find that quiet place we've got I don't care how busy we are we've got to keep that Soul free from the vibrations can you say man Elijah got so weary there he was walking with God Ravens feeding him walking with God such an incredible thing God performing miracles for the Widow such an incredible thing comes up to those that the the the the prophets of Baal God comes down and visits by the pillar of fire the situation I mean God comes down and it's just and he kills a 450 prophets amen but then when Jezebel heard about it and she got mad because her prophets were killed she said so be it to me she swore by her gods that she was going to kill him it caused a vibration and he got so weary he got so tired brother brandham would say Elijah knew that his God was real so he had brought it to a showdown but when the people had turned down the supernatural sign there was nothing to it the lightning must have struck Jezebel made her threats and all of her gang they didn't want to give up their social societies and little old Eli just heart was broke any Minister knows what Monday morning is after a hard day on Sunday compare that you Preachers Wives you know how how your husband is on Monday after he's preached hard two or three times Sunday he's so wore out what do you think that about poor little old Elijah there he was no one to comfort him he stopped under the juniper tree and he knelt down and looked up to God and said Lord I'm so tired and I'm so weary why don't you just take my life and let me go go my father's all went so let me go men who deal in that Supernatural who stay in the presence of God who who who when when you see God's program turned down and you preach it and you try your best and you do everything that God tells you to do and they still walk away from it it's heartbreaking but God Almighty has done enough here in the Angeles Temple this last week till it had Los Angeles set a fire no wonder he said it'll be more tolerable for solom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment and the little poor the poor little fella skinny lay there his gray hair hanging on his shoulders he said my servants God says my servant needs some rest God's mercy to his servants he just laid him down on a bunch of weeds and he went to sleep and I'd imagine there were 10,000 angels watching him sleep there was one Assurance there's one Assurance the believer has though the World Turns You Down God still loves him the world may call you Holy Roller and may call you fanatic but you're true to God there's one thing sure uh but if you're true to God there's one thing sure God loves you and his angels are encamped around those that fear Him someone say hallelujah he said I would imagine on every limb all around through the place with swarms of angels God come down and he said my poor little tired servant he's so nervous and tore up he don't know what to do I want to pick out the angel standing there that got the softest hands don't you scare him walk over and stroke his brow right easy I want the best cook among you go up there get all the vitamins you can find and put in the cornmeal the world's turned him down but I'm going to treat him right Hallelujah that means praise our God don't get scared of that bring forth the best that we caught cook him a corn cake set him set him down some water and this soft-handed Angel went over and stroked the little servant of God on the brow remember if you've done your best God still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he loved Elijah God God PL called that Elijah and that was a high calling and you'll never achieve that but the reason God called Elijah because he had some people that he loved you'll never be the seven Church age messenger but I promise you you're the reason he sent the seventh Church age messenger god put him through strict and training and I mean put him through the fire so that he would bring you a gospel that would be unadulterated he didn't have a family that he could come home to every night he wasn't able to raise his children like he wanted to you do God loves you God sent us a prophet so that you boys can know how to pick out your girls God sent us a prophet amen so that you children can know and appreciate your Mam and daddies God sent us a prophet amen so that you will know what kind of a Preacher to have behind your Pulpit God sent you a prophet God done this cuz he loves you he wants an intact family he wants you to have peace he wants you to be joyful he wants you to have love he wants you to have that God wants peace to be yours when brother Brandon was laying there and someone there was he fixing to die in the car wreck and someone said hey wh why don't he why don't he pray for himself he laid his hands on sister Brandon there someone says that I mean I it's not in tape he never preached another message after that but he someone says he laid his hand they laid his hands on sister brandom and the Lord brought her back from life so he was alive enough to do that but then he said the gift is not for me the gift was for you God remember if you have done your best God still got those angels in order he loves you the same as he loved Elijah he loves you mamas when you're tired he loves you daddies when you're when when when when you're when your spirits are all vibrating he loves you children when you're going through amen you're from changing from a boy to a to a man he in a girl to a a young lady he he loves you he loves you he knows where you are he's been there he says he stroked his brow and Elijah woke up and I may hear him say something like this Lord the Lord your God who loves you youve done your best Elijah I only sent those signs for a witness in that that day of the judgment and they'll have to stand alone You' done just what I told you to do and I know you're tired and weary now and the Lord God creator of heavens and earth has sent me to feed you this bread and water Elijah rubbing his eyes and raising up just little frail shaking hands took a hold of the bread and eat it and just then the great Angelic choir come out and formed a little panoramic around him like that and begin to sing the songs like no mother could CP her baby to sleep let him sleep again then father turned around and said you know I love him so much the journey is great he has got a lot to go through with yet and I'm not through with him so I got to feed him again so he called the angels and dumped in another big bundle of vitamins and cooked another corn cake and set him in a cruise of water and stroked his brow and fed him again I'm so glad that there is a juniper tree when we get all wore and tore up we can go under the juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of a trip he loves you he loves you are you hearing me there come a time that brother Bram needed to hear it again there come a time that there was a time it reminds me before I before I go there it reminds me of Abraham God came to Abraham in gen Genesis the 12th chapter and said you're going to have a son and it's going you're going to be a great nation and the and the and and the world will be blessed by by your seed and then the scripture says by the 15th chapter Abraham is asking the Lord I I don't have a son yet are you sure it's going to be through mine how about elzer he's my servant can you use him God told him in Genesis 12 God didn't rebuke him in Genesis 15 now stay with me a little bit longer now amen God didn't rebuke him God was gentle to him and God says he just patiently reminded him again you're mine God was gentle with Abraham and saying I'm going going to keep my promise to you Abram what I've spoke I will bring to pass for you brother brandham and ashamed y'all remember ashamed he just a little weary his little weary because all the politics and the politics and the in the world and and they weren't letting him into the found out they wouldn't let him into the preach over in that country because of of the religious men there was just a few religious men that had that had kept him out of that out of where was that Africa I I can't remember Out of Africa or wherever it was for for such a long time and he says and here we had 500,000 people over there the last time I was there he said I would do anything to go over there and help those colored people he said here the are hey they have nothing and then these white men are over here fighting us and keeping me from going in found out he says I found out it wasn't the whole country against me it was a few of those men in the high up rank that was keeping me out of that and then he preaches ashamed that I'm not ashamed and then he says I've got a little place up here at Greens Mill Indiana I'm gonna I'm G to go I want to go over and talk with the Lord a little while I feel like it's necessary he goes on as I'm getting to a spot where I need more faith that's what I'm home for now is to get a new burst of Faith God's Prophet God's prophet and I got to get home I'm going to I'm going to go sit inside that cave I got to pull aside I need a renewing there's too many vibrations right now going on I need a new I need a new I need a new burst of faith I need I need I need a a new anchor I need I need to go back I need God to reconfirm my commission again are you hearing me he says God so what it looks like what you pray for people you apologize Mr devil would you please move over and let me he says nothing faith has gotten muscles and hair on his chest when it speaks everything should shut up everything else shuts up don't don't go don't go in Mr devil and will you move out get out of here I'm a Son of God Commission of God leave them alone that moves you have no apology to the devil that nothing to do with it not ashamed of the word of God not ashamed of your commission not ashamed of who you are can you say Amen in a prayer at another season of his life he says if I have found Grace in thy sight strengthen this feeble body renew my strength renew my youthful strength as you do the Eagles and put my head high Lord and my heart low that I may walk Lord and yet manifest your love to the people give unto me a deeper love more consecration a deeper full of life Fuller life that I may serve you renewing of the Soul there's something I've been praying for during our Revival I would love for the Holy Spirit to just come down so sovereign and just so sovereignly come and renew everyone renew Every Soul we fought a lot of battles lately but we're here none of those things of the world has ever been able to take that desire away in fact the desire has been more intense whether you fallen or whether you've got distractions all around you or whatever it is there is something about your soul that is screaming out I must deep calling to the deep I must I must I must come back I must hear from my Lord I I need that renewing can you amen quietening quietening ourselves before the Lord oh my now as we as we get ready to dismiss here he said what makes the trees to Bud he said it's a refreshment what makes the refreshing he says early in the morning you go out early in the morning and you find out after the night everything settles gets real Ste then the de Falls and it brings a refreshing another place is the trouble of it is today people don't have time to get before God and get still there's so many things to do and they belong to this and they got to do this and they've got to have that and they've got to go there you don't have the time and the devil's just took up all of your time and you don't have time to get still before God and get quiet another place he says remember after all you're a nature and after all nature gets quiet and still then the de begins to fall and that refreshes and brings forth life and you're a nature yourself and when you get quiet and still before God then the D of Heaven begins to fall and begins to refresh how many wants are refreshing from the Lord we got the meeting coming up I want us to steal away let's quieten our Spirits let you know your desire before God the preachers that are coming ain't going to know nothing what's going on in our church I'm not a good communicator I never call or text anybody outside of I'm oh I'm bad but that's good when Revival comes because they don't know any problems we have amen our answer is not outside of us our answer is inside the king lives inside refreshment is inside all we have to do is steal away quite in that spirit before God if the musicians would come renew my soul there's a there's an old song that we sing that we used to sing renew me in thy Spirit renew me in thy spirit that I might live re [Music] [Music] baptize show me the ugliness of myself cered life renew me Lord that [Music] I oh renew me in thy [Music] spirit that I re baptize repurified [Music] help me Lord help me Lord show me the ugliness of the self centered [Music] life the purpose of God in your life will not be defeated [Music] all of the could have would have should us everything in the [Music] past at one time I would look to my dad in certain situations and I would say Dad I why did you why did you keep us in this in this situation why did you stay there in [Music] this when you were done wrong and you were hurt you were neglected and you were [Music] as a kid preacher I said just blows me away he said I had a purpose I wasn't going to do anything outside of hearing from the Lord and I wasn't going to pull my children out of be torn from Pillar To Post I wasn't going to you on E he said but we lived a life right there in front of everyone we lived that [Music] life because of that God shown his grace you boys are ministers of the Gospel Alena is a wonderful servant of [Music] God you grew in your struggles and it was important that I held my head right and kept my head straight and walked with God the way that he was leading me to show you boys how it's [Music] done as a kid preacher didn't mean a whole bunch but now that I'm getting a little bit older a little bit wiser I'm looking at the stability that God gave because somebody who was in the storms in the storms and the winds and that yet [Music] chose keep that soul in communion with God are y'all hearing me that's why we don't jump out of the tribe that's why we don't jump out of the situations and you don't want it you want to find the lily of the valley while you're in the valley you want to find the great Pillar of Fire right there with you in the Lion's Den it's in those places that we experience God in a great great great great wonderful way can you say Amen [Music] why sometimes as brother Merl said tonight sometimes God brings things for [Music] desperation he allows the situations to come he allows because God wants to pull us closer to him can you say Amen to that I want us to look in our hearts here tonight and if you've got any of those vibrations in your spirit that's that's keeping you nervous keeping you keeping your mind I want you to repent of that tonight anything that's that you're allowing to to keep you I want you tonight to say Lord I'm
