His face was worth the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book &gt;&gt; open, &gt;&gt; not closed. And he put his right foot upon the land and his left foot on the sea earth on right on the sea and the left on the earth cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar. And when he cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. &gt;&gt; And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write THEM NOT. DON'T WRITE them at that time." And the angel which I said saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven. Swear by him that liveth forever and ever. Created heavens and the things are there in the earth and things are therein are and the sea and all the things were therein. There should be time no longer. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; when he shall begin to sound, all the mysteries should be of God should be finished as he hath DECLARED TO HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS. [laughter] OH, I'M SO GLAD I SAW HIM. I SAW THAT REVEALED in my day. I can't deny it. It's more than life to me, friends. As a 17-year-old boy, God opened up started open up these mysteries to me.

We're we were thankful for that. We, um, we want to look here in the book of Revelations, the first chapter. And um you know um we we'll start here at the 10th verse. And um I I want to I I wanted to start this morning on uh maybe maybe start out just you know God's got an anointed an anointed bride here on the earth. And I I I want if the Lord would help me to um uh to just speak a little bit on the mystery of the church. And um but here in Revelations 1 and10, I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice of a trumpet saying, "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. what thou seeest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thitara, Sardis, Philadelphia, and unto Leodysia. And then I turned to see the voice that spake unto me, and being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks. And in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, gird about the paps with a golden girdle. We understand this is this is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Alpha, the Omega. His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow. His eyes were as the flame of fire. his feet like unto fine brass as they did as they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, "Fear not, for I am the first and the last. I am he that liveth, was dead, and behold, I'm alive forever more." Amen. And have the keys of hell and of death. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter, the mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks, the seven stars are the seven angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. Now, why don't we just go to the Lord in prayer? Father, we want to thank you. Thank you for your presence that we feel here today. Your your love to us and your blessings, the anointing, Lord, that that is present upon your word and upon your people. &gt;&gt; Father, we never want to do anything to spurn that love and your kindness to us. We ask that you would forgive us of our sins, Lord. Lord, purify our hearts and our minds. And may we always, Lord, walk worthily, Lord, of your love to us. And Father, we just ask that you would be here with us this morning, that you would speak the words of life to us. And Father, we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated here this morning. We want to uh look here this this morning and I I think I want us to uh I want to really um if the the thoughts of my heart is to really shine uh a light upon upon God's uh God's body here on the earth. And um we've sort of gone through Christmas and and and and in my way um of of talking how that man it was God in Christ then it was God in his bride. And it's important that we understand that because we're not a defeated people. Um we are a people with uh extreme purpose and and this this purpose we don't command God to do anything. I cannot command God to um to to heal. I cannot command God to u do anything. He he is not he he is not a servant of mine. I am his servant. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I can't I can't make uh uh God do anything. But what I but what I can do is believe what's in his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when his word says that I can have it, then I come with faith expecting to receive it. So we're not demanding God or commanding things of God. We are Amen. We are understanding that we are his his vessels. Just as Jesus said, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me. My desire is to please him." &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so um uh as as as the father gives me that I do. And so this is uh so I I want us to to to look as we look at some of these look at these symbols here this morning. And and just uh uh you know, first of all, when you look there at John the Revelator, Amen. he was a word prophet. And so, uh, a a word prophet is one that God comes to and and he reveals himself to. Amen. So, a a word prophet is not the same as a five-fold ministry prophet. Now, a a five-fold ministry prophet or a or [clears throat] even a gift of prophecy. You can you've got the the the word of knowledge. You've got the word of faith. You've got uh uh you you've got these gifts that are given to us. And we're and we're thankful for those gifts. Amen. And and we're thankful for the five-fold ministry. In the five-fold ministry, there's going to be the the the uh the prophet, uh the the pastor, the evangelist, the apostle, and the teacher. And and these are these are gifts to the church. But when God is going to speak and reveal uh his his hidden mysteries that God will raise up a prophet. He's a word prophet that will come. The Bible was written by prophets. So as a as the five-fold ministry, Amen. I have to take the words of the book. Amen. And and line everything that I believe up to that. But if I don't have the revelation, if the revelation for the age has not been given, then I can only see as I can see. And so I have to line it up with what what the revelation is that God has given me. And I think that's required of all of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but God sends the prophets to look be above and beyond and and begin to Amen. Uh that's how Jesus was foretold. His coming was foretold 800 years before. That's how that's that's how a lot of these prophecies were given and then later on were fulfilled. Well, the book of Revelation is is prophetic of the church. Amen. So there it's prophetic of what God was going to do in the church. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, first of all, John the Revelator, Amen. the Lord would raise him up. Now it, you know, John must have u must have felt really lonely as as he was as he was exiled to the aisle of Patmas, a small uh island on the Asian Sea. And you know, which is 30 miles off the coast of Asia Minor. And and this this island was a lot like Alcatraz. uh you know where where the uh this this is the place that the that um uh the the Roman emperor put the hardened criminals and and so this was an island out there was very rocky. It was full of deadly snakes, scorpions, lizards. Uh this is where this vision this is where the book of Revelations was was uh written from &gt;&gt; and and it was IT WAS A PROPHET AMEN. THAT THAT WAS TREATED LIKE A CRIMINAL. NOW, he was not A CRIMINAL. HE WAS A SPIRITUAL MAN. He he he was a prophet and and SO HE WAS A godly man. He wasn't a troublemaker. He wasn't uh you know, one that was that was going around vandalizing. He had very good character. Amen. He had a GOOD REPUTATION. THE THE PROBLEM was they they called him a witch. Yeah. They they thought that he was a witch and they were trying to kill him. &gt;&gt; And so, FIRST OF ALL, THEY THEY BOILED HIM. They Amen. They had him in a vat of grease for 24 hours trying to uh boil the the Apostle John, the prophet John. And uh Amen. BUT HE SURVIVED IT. HE he actually survived with absolutely no harm. and and and they and then they were really upset because they said he bewitched the Greece and Amen. Well, praise the Lord. God knows how to take care of his own. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But here's the real reason for his misfortune. The real reason is God WAS GOING GOD WAS GOING TO HAVE HIM EXILED SO THAT GOD WOULD HAVE HIM ALONE AND so that he could hear from God and get the revelation. Well, bless the name of the Lord. And and so uh we when you and and actually when you read there in in Revelations 1:9, it says, "I John, who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the aisle that is called Patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ." And I was in the spirit on the Lord's day. So, it wasn't a a a a certain day of the week. IT WAS GOD SHOWING HIM THE FUTURE. GOD working in his church. Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; NOW, I WANT TO TELL you the reason for Jesus coming was so that he would have a redeemed on the earth that he would work through. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we're Aren't you Aren't you thankful that God's got a divine purpose for your life? Amen. That's right. And so John wrote the book of Revelations in in symbols. Everything about the book was symbolic. Amen. you everything John John and and but I I I like this you know as as you as you look through the book of revelations you will find that the symbols that are used are all found rich literally in the old testament so a lot of these symbols that we read in the book of revelation is also found uh a lot of them uh is found there in the book of Daniel AND SO AS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS THIS MORNING I I want you to really see the picture that God is is wanting to put. Amen. In there, have you have you ever thought about uh um Amen. why the there had to be a lamb used in the Old Testament? Have you ever thought about why uh uh there was a tabernacle in the Old Testament? Have you ever thought about why there were the seven candlesticks in the Old Testament? Uh the ark of the covenant in the Old Testament? These were types of that which was coming today. That you were going to be the tabernacle of the Lord. Amen. THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS WAS going to redeem you to himself. And so once again, I I I I think it's I think it's very uh imperative that we that we take this and brother Merl uh quoted that quote this morning at the at the sounding of the seventh angel, the mystery. Now, brother brother uh uh he he didn't mean to do it. I'm I'm sure he said the mysteries of God. That's not the way the Bible said the mystery singular shall or should be finished. So So it's not it's not mysteries. It's one mystery. THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL THE PUZZLES, ALL THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE OF ALL THE PROPHETS ARE ALL COMING TOGETHER IN ONE MYSTERY. And that is &gt;&gt; that is you. That's the church. God in his church. [cheering] &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? SO, THE mystery of God should be finished. You are that mystery. Well, I want you to look to your neighbor and say, "Amen. Uh, I glad to know your mystery." Amen. So, so as we look in this it in in this again, it has been kept uh silent till the last age. Amen. These two years of 2,000 years of mystery, it is the mysterious work of redemption. Amen. And and it would be uh the total of all the symbols. When I talk about the symbols in in the book of revelations there even the ages were in symbols. The seven candlesticks, the seven stars in the right hand and the the great the four horse riders, the four living creatures before the throne, the great dragon, the beast coming out of the waters, the beast coming OUT OF THE LAND. ALL OF THESE things here, amen, were the SYMBOLS THAT WERE PUT and the and and and you and you ask why were they put in symbols? WELL, ACCORDING TO THE THE THE 10TH CHAPTER IS THE SYMBOLS WERE TO BE KEPT SECRET UNTIL THE SEVENTH church age. AMEN. SO THAT WHAT WHOEVER THAT SEVENTH uh angel is, then he will sound the mysteries. Amen. and he will will begin to reveal uh uh God would reveal God's great mystery. But until then, they were all in simple form. Praise the Lord. And I I'll tell you, I just put it out here just real real plainly. God, these guys, Apostle Paul, died believing that that Jesus was coming real soon. &gt;&gt; Every one of those 12 apostles died believing that Jesus was coming real soon. Amen. ALL THROUGH THE AGES, EVERYONE HAS DIED believing he's coming soon. He's coming soon. If they WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A 2,000-year period, WELL, THEY THEY THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES. Maybe maybe they wouldn't have been as uh uh you know, as diligent. They they they would have left IT FOR WHATEVER. BUT GOD WAS GOING TO HAVE A witness throughout Amen. THIS THESE LAST 2,000 UH YEARS of church history. But the scripture says in this day the mystery shall be finished. &gt;&gt; Well, somebody shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. SO, so it is the mystery of the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. She's lived her mystery out through these Amen. Uh through those seven churches. Amen. And so as we as we go through here this morning, I I I WANT US TO JUST ju just just just go through um some of the basics here and and let's just talk about these seven candlesticks. CHRIST WALKING in the midst of THE CANDLESTICKS &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID THE CANDLESTICKS is the mystery of THE CHURCH. SO THESE SEVEN CANDLESTICKS WOULD END UP BEING seven periods of time throughout church history. You would start with the first church age. They're in Ephesus and then IT WOULD GO ALL THE WAY DOWN. THESE ARE periods throughout the church history. And each one of these periods THERE IS A PROPHECY given to to to that church. And you would be able to look at that church. If you take for instance uh uh when in the dark age when when the uh Catholic church took over. Amen. The scripture says it right there uh right there in that third church age when when it would start coming in and and then they would start uh uh you know selling selling uh uh uh um you know uh um what do you call those novenas or uh you know selling things for for money and and selling blessings and well it's in the scripture. &gt;&gt; It's in THE SCRIPTURE AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THEY WOULD THEY would weigh out for a balance and they would do this. IT SAYS THAT THAT WOMAN JEZEBEL, WHICH WAS NONE other than THAT GREAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, AMEN, started to COMMIT AND TEACHING GOD'S SERVANTS TO EAT THINGS SACRIFICED TO IDOLS. &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S ALL IN THE SCRIPTURE. SO, SO AS WE GO THROUGH HERE, AMEN. EVEN THROUGHOUT THE CHURCH HISTORY, THUH THOUGH PAGAN UH THOUGH THE CHURCH WENT OFF IN in way off, God always had a bride in each one of those ages. HE'S ALWAYS HAD A people that he's got his hands upon. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. SO, SO HE SAYS, "I SAW SEVEN CANDLES, GOLDEN CANDLESTICKS, and and and I've seen the the the the mighty one, the great one. I seen the son of man walking throughout those candlesticks." BUT THEN HE SAYS, "THOSE SEVEN UH THE THE SEVEN STARS WHICH YOU SAW SAW ARE the seven angels to the seven churches." And then there are the seven candlesticks which are the churches themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we we want to we we want to SEE THIS BECAUSE THE WHOLE of the entire age is given in these seven distinct periods of time. Amen. There was Ephesus. There was Samrna. There was Pergamus, Thyron, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Leoa. And we're living in that last age. We're living in that last period of time, the Leoysian CHURCH. YOU SAY, "NOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE LIVING in the in the last age?" Well, the Bible said, "Amen." Well, he didn't have too much good to say about the this church age at all, did he? Amen. He says, He says, "You're rich increase with goods and say you have need of nothing." Amen. He says, "I I say to you, Amen. Uh uh you're you're blind, you're wretched, you're miserable, and you don't know it. &gt;&gt; You're deceived." Is that right? AND THAT CHRIST, IT WOULD BE THE VERY FIRST TIME that Christ would be on the outside of his church. &gt;&gt; I say we're living in that day today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh so we we look at those at at this at [snorts] these periods. Each age carried a certain characteristic. Amen. And this would be a direct prophecy to each age. Amen. each period of time and it foretells the spirit that would be behind the age. There was going to be THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST AND THERE WAS GOING TO be the spirit of the antichrist. There was going TO BE THE BRIDE OF Jesus and there was also going to be the great and her daughters the harlots. &gt;&gt; The Bible says this woman was going to be the mother of harlots. SO THERE'S AND EVERY ONE of them are going. These are churches. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE WORLD. We're talking about churches. So there is going to be a spiritual church who IS IN LOVE WITH HER GOD AND IS NOT GOING TO COMMIT ADULTERY ON HIM. IS GOING TO TRADE TRUE TO HIS WORD. AND THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE ANOTHER WOMAN, &gt;&gt; A CHURCH, &gt;&gt; USING THE same name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but they're going to be committing adultery against the one that they claim &gt;&gt; is her husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus even put it out there. Amen. In that and he and he and he talked about he talked about the parable of of the good the good man coming in and sewing the sewing the good seed. And then at night here comes the the evil man with the dark uh uh coat. He's coming in and he's sewing seeds. And then and then when the when the when the uh when they found out what happened, they come to the goodman of the house and said, "Hey, the uh there there was a bad guy come in and sewed seeds in the same field that you're in." And what did he say? He said, "Let him alone, lest while plucking up the bad seed, you also pluck up the good seed." He says, "LET THEM GROW IN THE SAME FIELD, AND AT HARVEST time we will know what is uh what is good and what is evil." &gt;&gt; THEY SAID, "WELL, WHAT WHAT DOES THIS PARABLE MEAN?" He says, "THE FIELD IS THE WORLD." &gt;&gt; The good swer is the son of man &gt;&gt; sowing good seed. &gt;&gt; The evil one, the the other one is the evil seowing evil seed. There's going to be tears. There's going to be wheat. But at the end, when it's harvest season, AMEN. THEN THEY WILL HARVEST THE TEARS, BIND THEM UP FOR BURNING, and they'll take the wheat into the garden. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, that's where we're at. &gt;&gt; We are at the reaping season. WE ARE AT. SO THE SEEDS THAT WE SAW IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION AND WE SAW THE SEEDS OF OF down through these ages when you re when you go home just begin to read through those through those uh uh revelations 2 THE SECOND CHAPTER and revelations the third chapter and and you will see those periods and you'll see THE SEEDS THAT SATAN WAS SEWING EVER SO EVER SO SLIGHTLY. THEY WERE LITTLE SEEDS contrary to the word of God. THEY WERE SEEDS OF DOUBT and unbelief. And brother, if there's anything we need to be CAREFUL FOR IS WATCH THOSE LITTLE THOUGHTS, WATCH the seeds THAT COMES FROM ANYBODY AROUND YOU THAT'LL POINT UH THAT THAT'LL THAT'LL THAT'LL CAUSE YOU TO DOUBT GOD'S WORD IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; GOD'S WORD must be our absolute. &gt;&gt; IT MUST BE AMEN. WHETHER I UNDERSTAND IT, whether I don't UNDERSTAND IT, IF GOD'S WORD SAYS IT, I believe it. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. SO, THE FALSE VINE IS GOING TO BE GROWING AT THE SAME time as the good vine. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, there's going to be two anointings. There's going to be the anointing of the antichrist, antirist, anti- word, and there's going to be the anoint of the genuine Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But Christ is going to be in that church in those seven candlesticks. I before I again I want to go back through it. &gt;&gt; Christ never left the candlesticks. He was walking through the seven churches the whole time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Christ will never leave you. &gt;&gt; As long as you're staying true to that word, I promise you he'll never leave you. Amen. [snorts] So, so he's the alpha and he's the omega. He's the God of the first church. He's the God of the last church. He's the one who started. He's the one that'll finish. He is before all times. He'll be after all times. Can you say amen? So, so we He started the church and God is very able to keep the church to complete his church. And this is the THIS IS THE GLORIOUS mystery because you as humans are GOING TO BE FULL OF FAULTS &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF FAILURES AND FAULTS THROUGHOUT THE CHURCH HISTORY. But the thing is you are redeemed by the Lord. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD LOOKS AT YOU, HE'S LOOKING AT YOU THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; He's looking at you through the blood of Jesus Christ. AMEN. AND AND AND IF YOU WERE TO LOOK THERE AT AT HEBREWS 10 and and um uh uh let's see um uh 10 and and and 12. Amen. It says, "But this man, after he HAD OFFERED ONE SAC sacrifice for sins, forever sat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expect until his enemies be made his foottool. FOR BY ONE OFFERING, SOMEBODY SAY BY ONE OFFERING. &gt;&gt; BY ONE OFFERING, &gt;&gt; he hath perfected. SOMEONE SAY, HE HATH perfected &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; Forever &gt;&gt; them that are sanctified. &gt;&gt; So, let's just get that straight right now. You are God's creation. YOU ARE GOD'S PEOPLE. YOU ARE HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. That's why when he said golden candlesticks, gold, goldat always represented gold always represented deity. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD IS GOING TO TO GIVE AN EX AN a um A VISUAL OF HIS CHURCH, HE DIDN'T GO GO PICK UP WOOD OR SOME NASTY STUFF. AMEN. TO REPRESENT YOU. HE CHOSE [screaming] GOLD. &gt;&gt; Praise [snorts] the Lord. Deity. &gt;&gt; DEITY. THERE'S GOING TO BE A CHURCH expressing [screaming] deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I feel good about right now. THAT'S WHAT HE'S WANTING TO DO. SO, THIS ONE THAT IS IN THE MIDST OF THE CANDLESTICKS, HE'S THE COVENANT GIVER. HE'S THE COVENANT KEEPER. HE IS THE GREAT I AM. [screaming] HE'S THE ONE THAT STARTED YOU. HE'S THE AUTHOR AND THE FINISHER OF YOUR FAITH. Shout &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is. He is that one. In fact, their revelations would say he is. Amen. He that sat on the throne was to look upon as jasper and sardine stone. And there was a rainbow round about the throne. Hallelujah. What What was God? He was saying, "I am the covenant giver. I am the covenant keeper. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, so these candlesticks are actually lampstands. And I I would like for you if you if you wouldn't mind, let's let's go to uh Zechariah the 4th chapter. And um this is this here is also a prophetic of the same thing. Amen. And um but candles will eventually go out, but a but a lampstand has a lasting quality about it. And so in a you you put a candle out and and you you you you put uh you know, you light it and that candle's, you know, when it's done, it's done. Hallelujah. But but and a lampstand, it it's got oil going through it. So it's got a bowl and we're fixing to read it here. It's got a bowl and then you put the oil in it and then there's a wick. Wicks are coming through these seven these seven uh candlesticks. Amen. But what it is and they're all fed they're they're all fed by the same oil. So the light that is being lit is coming from that from that bowl. So let's read it. And the angel talked with me again uh that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that wakenth out of his sleep and said unto me, "What seeest thou?" And I said, I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with with a bowl up on the top of it [clears throat] and lamp and and his uh seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the the seven lamps which are on the top of it. So So if you understand he's got there's a stand, then there's the bowl and then out of the bowl comes Amen. Let's see here. Hallelujah. comes the seven uh uh lamps. I almost gave you eight. Amen. So anyways, so and he and he says uh the seven pipes to the seven lamps which on the top thereof and two olive trees by it. One come upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof. So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? And the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, "Knowest not uh knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "No, my lord." And he answered and said unto me, saying, "This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubabel, saying, not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." Now, this is this is a prophecy that was given. And then of course then he's going to move on and talking about the the the the tabernacle uh that was fixing to be reerected. It would it would come back and and and and he would begin to talk about the natural uh the natural temple &gt;&gt; and but yet there is a there is a uh uh there's a dual meaning TO THAT BECAUSE GOD WAS SHOWING SOMETHING HERE. AMEN. those olive trees on each side, th those that that olive is the olive oil. Amen. The anointing was going to be coming from the New Testament and the Old Testament together that was going to feed this lampstand. WELL, JOHN IS NOW IN THIS IN THIS VISION AND HE'S LOOKING BACK AND HE IS SEEING HE'S SEEING THIS CANDLESTICK, these lampstands JUST EXACTLY LIKE GOD had given to to th this OTHER PROPHET. AND SO GOD WAS SHOWING THIS THAT WAS GIVEN UH H BACK THERE IN ZECHARIAH IS IS NOW GOING TO BE FULFILLED in the New Testament church. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's going to be fulfilled in the New Testament church. Now, uh well, I I thought that I think that's just wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, THESE LAMPS ARE ALL GETTING their oil from one boat. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. One bow. Somebody say &gt;&gt; one bow. &gt;&gt; Seven lamps. &gt;&gt; So wherever the first church got his light &gt;&gt; is where the last church better get his light. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. We know. We know that those olive trees WERE THE NEW TESTAMENT and the Old Testament. YOU HAD BETTER GET YOUR REVELATION FROM THAT WORD. YOU HAD BETTER GET EVERY BIT OF YOUR LIGHT FROM THUS SAITH [screaming] THE LORD. THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENT is the oil, the the anointing upon this church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, you got seven arms coming out of this bowl, which was the reservoir that holds the oil, and then the wicks run down into this. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same oil. You say, "Why do you keep saying that?" It's the same HOLY GHOST THAT THEY GOT ON THE BOOK ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST IS THE SAME HOLY GHOST THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING TODAY. &gt;&gt; IT BETTER BE. WELL, PRAISE THE LORD. WELL, GOD, DON'T DO THAT KIND OF STUFF ANYMORE. THEN THEN THEN you've got your own bowl somewhere else. And you better be careful because you might be one of those harlots &gt;&gt; THAT IS COMMITTING ADULTERY AGAINST THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE A HARLOT WITH THE WORD OF GOD. IF GOD IS MY HUSBAND, AMEN. IF I'M HIS BRIDE, THEN LET ME STAY TRUE TO THAT VOW TO HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; Bless the name OF THE LORD. THE SAME OIL, THE SAME HOLY [screaming] GHOST. IF THEY TALKED IN tonesues in the first church age, they're talking in tonesues in the last church age. If they if they had miracles in the first CHURCH AGE, THEN THEY'VE GOT MIRACLES IN THE LAST CHURCH AGE. IF THEY BELIEVE THE WORD AND WENT TO THE GROUND, THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THIS WORD, then I believe that same anointing should be UPON EVERY ONE OF US to believe the exact same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, come on, church. There's nothing different. &gt;&gt; It's the same oil. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; it's the original fire. Did you know? Let's Let's just Can we Can we just stop for a moment? Hallelujah. Did you h how you know THEY HAD THE SEVEN candlesticks that were also in the in the tabernacle in Moses tabernacle? Amen. They had the candlesticks. did. Praise the Lord. When God when God told them to put that to to to build the tabernacle and then tell him to put all of the all of the uh the the the vessels inside it. Amen. And and do you do you realize how they lit that first candle? Hallelujah. This is this is crazy. Because when they done it, Amen. The pillar of fire came down and consumed that first uh offering that that first sacrifice had came down and they were to take the fire that God lit himself to light the candle and they would take that first candle that was lit OFF OFF OF THE ALTAR. The &gt;&gt; to me that JUST THAT JUST BLOWS MY MIND. THEY DID NOT THEY DID not come in with a big uh a lighter and and was LIGHTING THE CANDLES. IT WAS COMMANDED THAT THEY TOOK THAT FIRST CANDLE, GO TO THE TO THE GREAT FIRE THAT [screaming] GOD STARTED. &gt;&gt; And then they would go take that one and it would light the second one. Then they would put it in its place. Take the second one, light the third one, put it in its place. Take the third one, light the fourth one, put it in its place. Take the fourth one, light. And that's and that's how they they were to go through their lid. And then it required the oil from all of them. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "Does that does that really matter?" Yeah, it did &gt;&gt; because Aaron's son just a few years later, &gt;&gt; Aaron's son came in with strange fire. They brought their bicks and they came in there to light the candle. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Well, we all know what happened to them. They died. &gt;&gt; God killed them right there. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says they were offering strange fire. God don't want strange fire. &gt;&gt; God wants what he gave on the day of Pentecost OR HE'LL HAVE NOTHING. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GOD WANTS WHAT THE FIRST CHURCH HAD IN THE BOOK OF ACTS. OR HE'LL HAVE NOTHING. GOD WANTS WHAT HE'S GOT IN THAT ORIGINAL CHURCH. AMEN. In the New Testament that we read or he WILL HAVE NOTHING. SOMEONE SAY YES. &gt;&gt; I want the anointing. THE SAME ANOINTING. NOT THE STRANGE FIRE. And boys, I want this. I don't want you. It's you. You You can't You can't be a Christian and and do things the way you want to do it. ELDERS, YOU CAN'T BE A CHRISTIAN AND DO THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK YOU need to do it. YOU'VE GOT TO use the original fire or God will not accept it. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of the Lord. DO YOU LOVE HIM? &gt;&gt; SO, THE PRIEST WOULD TAKE THAT SACRED FIRE FROM OFF THE THAT SACRED ALTAR. AMEN. AND THAT WAS ORIGINALLY LIGHTED BY GOD. AND he would take that and that's how he would lie or or that he would Amen. Uh uh that that that's how the candlesticks were were uh done. Now I want us to look for a moment uh at at these candlesticks of of beaten gold and and because and and and we're going to be dealing with this a little bit later on too, but I I just want us to come back to the to the gold, the deity, the rarity. The gold is the rarest of all and it's and and it was created in in that. Amen. And and you say, "HOW can me, how can you as the church, how can I ever be likened unto deity?" Because Jesus plainly said, "The candlesticks represent the church." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I wish we could get that in our minds THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST and his righteousness upon you, GOD can't see your sins. &gt;&gt; God can't see your wrongs. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE SHED HIS BLOOD [screaming] NOT FOR THAT ONE AND THAT ONE AND THAT. NOW, PRAISE THE LORD. He didn't shed his blood for the harlots. He shed his blood for his elect &gt;&gt; because he knows that you COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; He had to provide it. That's why he came. That's why deity came in a body in the first place. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So we understand that the church is made of humanity. Now I am not saying that the church DOESN'T REPENT. THE BLOOD DOES YOU NO GOOD IF YOU DON'T REPENT. That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU YOU GO AROUND AND AND ACTING LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT WRONG AND YOU'RE YOU'RE AS DEAD WRONG AS DEAD WRONG CAN BE. YOUR SINS ARE NOT ATONED FOR. &gt;&gt; You've got to accept it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You You remember the pardon the the pardon that that Abraham Lincoln had given. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, the boy went awall and got scared and and and and and so he ran away and and uh Amen. And they, you know, they found him and they was going to hang him or no, they was going to I think it was in is in President Lincoln's day, so that's probably going to uh go go before a firing squad. And and so uh the mother had been been just trying everything. She couldn't finally, you know, she had been looking for uh Lincoln and he knew that she knew that he was going to be at a certain function. And so she finally got up to him and she said, "Please, sir, please. My son is going to be killed tomorrow. He's a good boy. He's a good boy. He He didn't He loves his country, but he got scared and he ran off and and Lincoln listened to this mother and and he took his pen, took took an old envelope and AND HE WROTE PARDON ON IT AND SIGNED HIS NAME." SHE RUNS [screaming] BACK, GOES TO THE JAIL AND AND GIVES IT TO THE OFFICER SAYS, "THIS IS BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN." THEY HAND IT TO THE BOY. AND THE BOY LOOKS AT IT WAS A BROKEN. It was just a It was just an old torn off piece of an envelope. And and and the and and and the boy looked at it and he said, "If this come from the president, it would have seal. &gt;&gt; You guys are making fun of me. YOU'RE MOCKING ME. THEY WERE SAYING YOUR MOTHER GOT THIS FROM HIM YESTERDAY. IT'S A FULL PARDON. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; WELL, he refused. They hung him. So then they now was a court case and they went to court. They went through it through all the deal and the verdict was this. A pardon is only a pardon if it's accepted &gt;&gt; as a pardon. &gt;&gt; I I I I know it wasn't an angel coming down from heaven that it it was a it was a human being with beard ripped out of his of and he was and he was bloody and he was unrecognizable and he was hung up there with with all of the other with with the OTHER TWO CRIMINALS. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT WAS GOD'S ENVELOPE TO YOU. THAT THAT WAS JUST A COMMON MAN. IT WAS A COMMON MAN. THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT WAS WRITING, [screaming] "I FORGIVE YOU. YOU ARE PARDONED. YOU ARE FREE." AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO THE CHURCH. AMEN. IN THESE CHURCH AGES, AMEN. GOD'S GOT A BRIDE AGAIN. WHY WOULD GOD HAVE THE HARLOT AND THEN GOD WOULD HAVE HIS LITTLE BRIDE? WHY WOULD GOD MAKE THE DISTINCTION? THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE THAT IS GOING TO BELIEVE HIS WORD. THEY'RE GOING TO STAND UPON HIS WORD AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE God's righteousness in their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; MAN, [snorts] that just makes me that JUST MAKES ME SHUDDER TO THINK [screaming] OF GOD'S GOODNESS TO YOU. HIS GOODNESS TO ME. [applause] DON'T SPURN GOD'S LOVE. DON'T SPURN GOD'S GRACE. CAN YOU SAY &gt;&gt; AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, it was a beaten goat. When you go back and you look at it, it was a beaten goat. It was It was Amen. The dross was going to come out of it. Amen. God was going to put you through THE TEST AND GOD WAS GOING TO PUT THINGS AND APPLY PRESSURE IN YOUR LIFE. AMEN. But remember, every test, EVERY [screaming] TRIAL IS TO BRING purity out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what second Peter 1 and3 says, "But according as his divine power, &gt;&gt; hath given unto us all things." Somebody say, "All things." that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him who hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises. And I love this part right here. Why don't we just all say it together? That by these YE MIGHT BE partakers of the divine nature. Well, I figured y'all would be up dancing the aisles on that one. That we might be partakers of his divine nature. I don't care what your past is. I don't care what what situation what you're going through right now. Amen. Remember, God's got a divine purpose that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in this world through lust. I I And so I'm saying that God's church, WHEN GOD LOOKED AT YOU, when he's looking at you, Kaye, when he's looking at at at at at at at you, I want to call you Connor. Amen. Whatever your name is. Amen. And and and APRIL AND JOHN AND FRESCA and what whatever your girl's name is. Amen. He's got he WHEN HE LOOKS AT YOU ALL, HE IS NOT LOOKING [screaming] AT YOUR HUMANITY. HE'S LOOKING AT HIS DIVINE GLORY UPON YOU. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; All right, let's look. Let's take another type. The mercy seat. The mercy seat was made of shitwood. Now, how many knows what the mercy seat? The mercy seat was where Amen. That that was in between the the two cherubams and and and the glory of God would rest settle down upon that seat. That's that was that was God's throne. THAT WAS GOD'S EARTHLY THRONE. He would come right there. That's why David says, "Hey man, how is it that I live in sealed houses and you live in a tent?" See, that was where God Well, now, but this this this mercy seat was made of wood. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was it was it was not really the best of woods. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not Well, Glory to God. Oh, that just makes me want to shout. So, so we we we when when when we look then they would take then they would take the the gold and they WOULD MELT THAT GOLD and it would be over the top. It would all be on the outside. It would be on the inside. So every bit of the wood humanity would now have [screaming] gold deity all around it. Now it was A TYPE OF CHRIST who is our mercy seat. &gt;&gt; CHRIST IS OUR MERCY SEAT. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. He be he was a human. He was human made of ma made of of of the SHITTAMWOOD O OVERLAID INSIDE AND OUT WITH THAT GOLD. HALLELUJAH. Now that shiddamwood was was one of the most porest of of of woods. It it would soak up anything. Hallelujah. Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Your flesh will soak up evil. It'll soak up good. &gt;&gt; And that's WHY YOU NEED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST OR YOU can't even be considered a part of the CHURCH YET. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS WHEN DEITY COMES UPON YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? THAT'S WHY WE SAY YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THAT SHAM WOULD IT IT WAS SO POROUS. AND SO THEY WOULD TAKE THAT GOLD, MELT IT, AND POUR IT OVER AND THE GO THE WOOD would suck it in until the wood and the gold become one. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord. Where was it positioned? It was positioned in the most holy place. THAT WAS WHERE GOD WOULD COME DOWN UPON THAT UPON THAT WOOD. WELL, PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. ARE ARE YOU HEARING ME? THE MERCY SEAT SET ON THE TOP OF THAT. AND THAT IS WHERE GOD FORGAVE SINS. THAT'S WHERE GOD WOULD VISIT THE PRIEST. THAT'S WHERE GOD WOULD WOULD MOVE and and the presence of the Lord would be known. &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus Christ become our he become our ark of the covenant. He become our mercy seat. &gt;&gt; But but praise the Lord. Wouldn't the second person of the Godhead? Wasn't the third person of the Godhead? Wasn't the FIFTH PERSON OF THE IT WAS ALMIGHTY [screaming] God &gt;&gt; coming down in that body &gt;&gt; and become so at one with him. Now the flesh still looked to God and said, "Father, Amen. Are you hearing me?" &gt;&gt; Amen. I knew nothing except the father. Someone said, "Well, why did Jesus pray?" He was a man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But within him was the fullness of the godhead bodily. There you go. &gt;&gt; Today they're so synonymous. The wood and the gold is so well. Praise the name of the Lord. He was your kinsman redeemer. He become one of us in order to redeem you. Come on now. Look at Boaz and Ruth. Amen. There had to be a kinsman redeemer. There had to be. NO ONE ELSE COULD DO IT. AMEN. WHEN NAOMI COME BACK THERE, THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON THAT COULD REDEEM. THAT WAS THE KINSMAN REDEEMER. AND WHEN IT COME TO YOU, YOU ARE FLESH. YES, BUT YOU ARE ALSO THE CHILDREN OF THE MOST HIGH GOD. [screaming] WITHIN YOU IS A SOUL. THAT SOUL CAME FROM GOD. YES, THAT SOUL WAS LOST. [screaming] BUT GOD HAD TO COME DOWN TO REDEEM you in your fallen condition. IT HAD [screaming] TO BE. NO OTHER HUMAN BEING COULD COULD REDEEM YOU. &gt;&gt; You can't die for me. I CAN'T DIE FOR YOU. WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE we're rejects. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why was God worried about that then? What do you mean? Because we were kin to God. We were made in the image of God. Yeah. Our soul came from God. [laughter] Are y'all hearing me? So now here we ARE IN A SPLIT NATURE. WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT SOULS AND WE GOT A FLESH AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GO BACK UNTIL there's redemption so God become a human being. &gt;&gt; God could become a human being so that he could die pay the price &gt;&gt; to take us back to where we belong. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you when God looks at you, Dylan, he's not looking at you as a as as a reject anymore. You're a reject for the world. Amen. We're we're we're all rejects. But but I want to but but that's not who you are. YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. WELL, PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. HOW WE NEED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. LORD, I ACCEPT YOUR BLOOD. I APPLY [screaming] YOUR BLOOD. I I'M GOING TO COME BEFORE YOUR THRONE. I WANT YOU TO MOVE WITHIN ME. I want to become your mercy seat. You say you become the mercy seat. You do. &gt;&gt; For when Christ comes in you, Jesus looked at the apostles and says, "Whatsoever you bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. Whatever you bind uh h loose on earth, I'll loose in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the elect of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How do we do the greater works? The greater works is when we extend mercy. &gt;&gt; Greater works than these shall you do. What is these greater works? Preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. Declaring who who your children are. Preach that gospel. That's the greater works. That's the power of the Holy Spirit. How am I we don't we don't loosen sin. We don't we we we don't loosen sins and bind people's sins uh uh like the Catholic Church does. No. How how DO WE LOOSE SINS? WE PREACH THE WORD. REPENT. BE BAPTIZED [screaming] EVERY ONE OF YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. FOR THE PROMISE IS UNTO YOU, UNTO YOUR CHILDREN AS MANY AS THE LORD THY GOD SHOULD [screaming] CALL. AND ON THAT DAY 3,000 SOULS WERE ADDED to the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone done some binding and loosening that day. The gospel preached bind. &gt;&gt; Let's see. That's that's it was now in the church. IT WAS JESUS WAS GOD. NOW [screaming] THE CHURCH THE CHURCH [clears throat] WAS NOW LIVING AND EXPRESSING THE GRACE OF GOD. AND 3,000 SOULS [screaming] WERE SAVED BY THE PREACHING OF THE CHURCH. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; They become you become you become the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; That makes me that that makes me want to shout &gt;&gt; without controversy. Great is the mystery of godliness. God manifest in the flesh. Can you say amen? Hallelujah. Amen. He's redeemed. Revelations 5 and9. And they sung and I'm going I know I'm I' I've left off my main point, but I'm getting back to it. I promise. Amen. But they Revelations 5:9, they sung a a NEW SONG, SAYING, "THOU art worthy to take the book and to open the SEALS THEREOF. FOR THOU WAS SLAIN, AND HAST REDEEMED US TO GOD [screaming] BY THY BLOOD OUT OF EVERY KINDRED, TONGUE, PEOPLE, AND NATION." IF YOU'RE REDEEMED, IF YOU'RE REDEEMED, [screaming] THEN HOW CAN YOU BE A SINNER? IF YOU'RE REDEEMED, HOW CAN YOU BE JUDGED FOR YOUR SIN? IF YOU [screaming] ARE REDEEMED, HOW MANY REDEEMED IS IN THE BUILDING TODAY? WE'RE REDEEMED BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, we're going to stop there for a moment. It's an earthly. Now I want because I want us to get at the stars real quickly. Amen. &gt;&gt; This now there were the seven churches humans that were &gt;&gt; anointed of the Holy Spirit. Oh, glory to God. It I I don't know what you guys are feeling up there, but it's it's pretty good right here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when I begin to feel this good, I'm I'm I'm about ready to go find a devil to kick on. Hallelujah. Amen. Why? We're anointed for this. &gt;&gt; It's the word that HAS ANOINTED US. WE'RE GETTING it from the revelation of who we are. &gt;&gt; That does that. We don't need somebody WITH GREAT SOME KIND OF A GREAT SPIRITUAL GIFT. WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE, &gt;&gt; MAN. So there were seven church ages or seven seven church uh seven candlesticks were the seven periods of time. God used the characteristics of those seven churches in the seven uh uh to to point out the characteristics throughout the seven periods of church history. So these last 2,000 years is now is is is there's seven periods of time that God has allotted and he has fortold what was going to happen in each one of those periods of history down through church uh through the church history and that's the reason why he even foretold that that that that the uh the Protestant movement would would come up out of the Catholic church after a thousand years amen almost a millennium of of the of the Catholic Church reign. pain in the dark in in the dark ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then here come Martin Luther coming up resisting says you have just a little bit of strength but if you Amen. But but but but you're you're you're you're staying true to my name. Amen. Here comes Luther and then here comes on out and and and another THE PHILADELPHIA WITH WESLEY. Each each one of these new periods OF TIME. AMEN. GOD IS IS DECLARING THROUGH THOSE times what was going to be taking place. NOW BUT I I WANT US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEVEN angels of the seven churches now I want us to just look at this those word that word angels comes uh from the Greek word angelos that is that is a n g o s and the strongs g32 and and it's angelos is a very is a very broad term &gt;&gt; and so it means messenger. So, so when in in the Greek the when they're using messenger then they expect you to take the context of what is being said and then you can understand. So when that angel that messenger came to Mary amen and the brightness and then you understood that that was a supernatural uh being. But when looking here, amen, this here was talking to the angel of the churches. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. These were messengers of the churches or uh uh UH ACTUALLY THE PASTORS OF THE CHURCHES. That that's who they were talking about there in those seven uh physical uh uh uh churches in Asia. So, so they were sent they were sent there were seven copies made of this and sent to all seven of ages, seven of uh uh seven churches. But it was representative OF WHAT GOD WAS GOING TO DO in the church ages. How many's understanding it? It was a type of what the church was going to be. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now, so amen. So it in it envelopes the envelopes the the divine and the earthly messengers. So but but the the classical biblical Greek meaning to that term, Amen, is someone sent with a message, an envoy, a representative. Amen. So it it's an earthly it's an earthly messenger. BUT IT CAN ALSO be be used uh uh be be referred to heavenly divine beings such as angels. But but when that scripture was I I send my messenger BEFORE MY FACE. WELL, THAT WAS talking of prophet John. That was an angel. I send my angel before my face to prepare the way of the Lord. Well, amen. Jesus says, "Well, that that that messenger was John and YOU MISSED HIM. YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A heavenly angel and here I CAME TO JOHN COME PREACH IT TO YOU. WELL, the prophet is a messenger. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD IS DEALING WITH THE SEVEN church ages and he's dealing to the messengers of the age, he is NOT NECESSARILY TALKING ABOUT the heavenly angels. These were going to be seven men in these seven PERIODS OF TIME THAT God was going to anoint. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it was not going to be these men on their own because we're we're fixing to find out here in a minute. Amen. That that there are seven spirits around the throne of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; AND THOSE SEVEN SPIRITS HAD TO COME DOWN AND anoint the seven messengers. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so keep keep that in your mind. Amen. So, the context is is is is very very important. So, we've got we we've got to the angel of Ephesus, the angel of Samrna. Amen. But again, you go back all you know 90% of all the scholars says it was talking to earthly messengers. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were angels. THEY WERE DECLARING THE MESSAGE to that church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Now, so um so as we read or as as we go on, so the earthly and the heavenly were we're we're both of God. Amen. They because it required the heavenly angel to give the inspiration to the earthly angel. And that's how Amen. it becomes so supernatural. That's how Martin Luther stood against the entire world and was able to resist the Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; Tell me, tell you say, "No, it was just that just happened." Why didn't Husk and why didn't Wikliff and why or not Wikliff but uh uh uh some of these others uh down through the history there that was trying to resist the CATHOLIC CHURCH, THEY COULDN'T DO IT. It wasn't the time yet. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; So without going through any of that depth, I I I my my my my purpose is to understand that where we are and that the anointing that's upon this wood, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This anointing that [laughter and gasps] Hallelujah. If if if you would just start looking at that brother and and quit looking at him as the shittam would and start looking at him as the ark. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, you say, "No, no, no. God's the one that made you the gold. &gt;&gt; It's God that has done that." And any of our power comes from God. There'll never come anything. So, I'm not saying that you're God. I am saying, &gt;&gt; "Come on, &gt;&gt; you're made out of the Just as you're made out of the same dust I'm made out of, I'm made out of the same gold he's made of." [laughter] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. I MADE IT THE SAME GOAL. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now I want you to look. &gt;&gt; So that heavenly angel gave the inspiration to the earthly. Both shared the task giving the the message uh to to the people. Amen. They were both sent with God's word. In other words, you could have a messenger, earthly messenger, but if he is not vindicated by God, &gt;&gt; is that right? But let's look at it. Let's look at a few things here in the scripture. Just just real quickly. Do we still have time? &gt;&gt; Let's look at the sevens. Let's look at a few sevens just real quick. I want I want to look at a seven. There are seven heavenly messengers. There are sevenly earthly messengers. And there are seven churches. Now, I I want us to just look in the Bible here for a few moments that Revelations 1 and 4. Turn to it if you wouldn't mind, Sister Keys. I want you to put that up, too. But uh let let's turn to it so you'll know it's in the Bible. Amen. I I I sometimes I go to this when people are trying to tell me that there's more than one God and then I give them this revelation. I tell them I think there's seven. JOHN TO THE SEVEN churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne. Let's go to Revelations 4 and5. It's going to progressively give us it's going to give us a deeper meaning as we as we progress in Revelations 4 and 5. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices. And there were seven lamps. Remember the seven church ages. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. So we've got out. Now I want us to look. We've got the seven the seven churches, the seven candlesticks, and they're relying on the presence OF THE LORD. IT'S GOT to be the same anointing of the of the DAY OF PENTECOST, THE PILLAR of fire, the almighty God, the logos. It's got TO BE THAT SAME ANOINTING. And there are seven spirits. You say, "Are there really seven spirits?" No. God's giving us visuals. &gt;&gt; SEVEN ANOINTINGS THAT WERE GOING TO ANOINT THAT CHURCH, THAT THOSE EARTHLY church throughout that church ages. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those church ages. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; okay. So, now he's saying those seven lamps. Now, now he was saying seven spirits before the throne. Now, he's saying there's seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. Amen. Hallelujah. Now, now remember, if you go to Zechariah, if you read that whole there, they're there in Zechariah 4 and2, you know, when he when he asked him, "What what are you looking at?" And he talks about the candlesticks and he and he's talking about the bowls and you know and and the lamp and it shall not be by might nor by power but by my spirit. If you were to go down to the 10th verse there uh uh Zechariah 4:10 for who despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubel with those seven. They are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro throughout the earth. Now we're looking. Amen. When he's when he's look when he's talking about those seven candlesticks. Now he's saying those lamps are the eyes of the Lord roaming to and fro. He's prophesying of that church that is to come. Let's stay with me. How many still with me? Amen. Revelations 5 and six. Amen. Revelations 5 and six. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb as it had been slain. Now, here's the lamb having SEVEN HORNS, SEVEN EYES, WHICH ARE THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD SENT FORTH INTO THE EARTH. SO NOW WE'RE FIND NOW WE'RE NOW YOU I WANT YOU TO JUST CATCH the seven seven7 eye spirits. Now the Lord is showing his here. Amen. It is the lamb in the church. It is deity in humanity. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; AND THE LIGHT OF THE [screaming] SEVEN CANDLESTICKS ARE THE SPIRITS OF GOD, THE EYES OF God throughout all of the earth. But now he's bringing in the horns. &gt;&gt; Horns have always represented strength. Look it up in the Bible. The horns of my salvation. The seven horns. The lamb had seven horns. There's going to be the power of God. There's going to be the life of God. Are you hearing me? Amen. Now I'm I'm still talking about the stars, the light. These messengers, amen, THE ARE EARTHLY MESSENGERS. BUT there is a there THERE IS THE ALL OF HEAVEN. Old New Testament is all one story. REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL ONE STORY. NOW, I WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE elders and the and throughout, you know, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT HERE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE STARS AND THE CANDLESTICKS. &gt;&gt; The seven stars are giving light to the church. So, when you when you go and you read there, um, [snorts] let's just now hang on to my thought. Don't don't don't leave what I'm saying. Don't don't leave. Hang on to it. Amen. But but I I I want to just show you. Okay. Revelations 2 2 and 1. Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus. Right. That was the first church age. Amen. Go on down to the eth verse. UNTO THE ANGEL OF THE CHURCH IN SAMRA. RIGHT. OKAY. AMEN. Going down to the 12th verse. Unto the angel of the church of Pergamus. Right. YOU YOU GO ALL THE WAY DOWN. SEE, THIS WAS MYSTERIOUS UNTIL THE LAST DAY. AND IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH MESSENGER, the mystery will be finished. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; God promised that he would do that. Now, am I making sense to you all? &gt;&gt; It is as CHRIST IS STANDING THERE. IT IS IT IS IT'S NOT SEVEN SPIRITS. It is it in in the fact that because God done said here, oh Israel, there's one Lord and he says there is no God beside me. So he's not going to turn around in the Old Testament, no God beside me and now I've got seven of them beside me. No, no. It's God showing that the church age is going to have seven particular periods. And throughout these periods, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you. &gt;&gt; That's it, brother. &gt;&gt; I'll never forsake you. seven different periods of time. But my anointing is with where my anointing is, my strength is. &gt;&gt; My eyes are roaming to and fro. [laughter] I'm in my church. I'm living my life. My anointing is upon you. Can you say amen? So then we find that when we go down through these ages that God would raise up men. These were be these would be seven distinct men throughout the periods of time that God would raise up to bring light to that generation. These would be human beings. They were they were sinners that had to BE SAVED BY GOD JUST LIKE YOU. THEY WERE GOING TO DIE JUST LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO die unless you make the rapture. this we're at the season of rapture. The these these are these are these KINDS OF MEN. BUT THESE WERE MEN THAT GOD SEPARATED TO HIMSELF. YOU SAY, IF WE'VE GOT THE HOLY GHOST, THEN THEN THEN WHY DO WE WHY DO WE NEED I DON'T KNOW WHY GOD HAD THE LAMPSTANDS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN STARS. The lamp had the oil UNDER HERE. BUT WHEN GOD WANTED TO REVEAL ANYTHING TO THESE LAMPSTANDS, unto the angel, right? Unto the angel, right? &gt;&gt; Unto the angel, right? &gt;&gt; Unto the angel, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see WHAT I'M SAYING? SO WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO YOU IS see God GOD DOES THINGS THAT HIDES HIS MYSTERIES IN SUCH incredible ways that the church world won't even know anything about. &gt;&gt; And then Satan will come in and he knows that there's going to be an earthly church or an earthly strength. There's going you're going to be his earthly body. And so that's the reason why Satan has got all of these other junk going out there where people don't even want to trust the church anymore. They don't even want to come into a church because all that just filth of all the prostitutes out there that have prostituted the word of God &gt;&gt; till they look at you and think you're just weird. &gt;&gt; Huh? Right. &gt;&gt; And and and and you can look you can take them right back TO SCRIPTURE. I WAS BAPTIZED THE WAY PAUL OR PETER SAID TO BE BAPTIZED. I BELIEVE IT THE WAY AND they'll still look at you. No, no, no. That's not the way my harlot church teaches. That's not the way that we understand it. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But God's got his God's got his. Amen. God's standing there. The the the Bible the Bible says in this last church age, Amen. He says unto the angel of the of of of the church of Leodysy. Matter of fact, let's just let's just read it. Um uh we'll just read this is our church age. This is what this is the pronouncement to our age. &gt;&gt; Amen. that there in in in Revelations 3 and4 unto the angel or the messenger of the church of the leodysans write these things sayaeth the a man the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works now if this don't depict us dear God I know THY WORKS THAT THOU ART NEITHER COLD NOR hot wood thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out OF MY MOUTH BECAUSE THOU SAYEST, I'M a rich church. Increase with goods. He's talking to the church now. Increase with goods and have need of nothing. And he says, you're deceived. And knowest not knowest thou uh uh knowest not that thou art wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich white raignment that thou mayest be clothed that thy shame of thy nakedness do not appear. Anoint thine eyes with eye sad that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent. Do you realize that we were all born into this setting? &gt;&gt; Yes. But the Holy Spirit has come and pulled you out &gt;&gt; and said, "I'm not going to have you. I'm not going to have my bride into this nonsense. You ain't on fire." What? What you talking about? You don't love my word. You'd rather debate it. &gt;&gt; You won't follow my word. You You You're just You're just wanting TO BE RELIGIOUS. I DON'T WANT YOU BEING RELIGIOUS. YOU ARE ME ON EARTH, &gt;&gt; living in sin and GOING OUT AND DOING THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER. [screaming] NO, GOD DOESN'T WANT A CHURCH MEMBER. HE WANTS A [screaming] BRIDE THAT HE CAN IMPREGNATE WITH HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Is that right? But there's lots of times that you ladies and there's for some reason, well, it's good reason that God typed his church as the bride. &gt;&gt; Well, I hope I'm doing all right here this morning. But I know my girl, when I talk to her, when she talks to me, sometimes she feels like she's not I'm just not good enough wife and I'm not a good enough mother. [sighs] You could have got somebody better. I'm just ugly. And I've counel counseledled enough of ladies that Amen. where that that that I know that that Satan fights you of your worthiness. And And it's not it's not bad. It's It's not bad in the slightest bit because God built the woman to be support to her man. God built the woman as a companion suitable for her man. That's what a help me is. So her desire is to please her husband. And if she doesn't feel like she's pleasing her husband or feels like she's not as good of enough mother, it it it brings an inferiority complex. And that's why us men have got to make sure that we're putting our our our our our arms around our wives and letting them know, I love you with all of my heart. And I when I say I love you, I mean it. And that's what God is saying to the church. You you you are you are you all through these ages all through these ages. You you're you're you're there. But I'm there with you. I'm walking in and out my spirit. There is a when a seven spirits let let me just deal with that for just a moment. I promise I'm shutting up. &gt;&gt; Seven spirits. I'm going to shine a light on this specific part. Okay. Let's let's let's just just real quickly when when Luther coming out of the church ages or coming out of that Catholic church, God shown a light. He was a he was a priest. He was trying to find peace for him. So he couldn't he couldn't find it. They sent him to Rome. And so he's he's he's he's he's going up kissing and crawling these steps and kissing these crosses when it struck to him. A light struck him and said, "The just shall live by faith." Then he gets up, dust his clothes off, and says, "You I'll never be able to earn peace." Now, he had done everything. He he had he had beat his back until it was just bloody pulp trying to find peace. They told him, "If you do this, you do this, you do this." So, now he's trying. He's he's he's his knees are bleeding as he is as he is crawling up and kissing so many crosses and keeps on crawling and keep and when the Lord appeared to him the just shall live by faith that anointing that was upon the earth so changed him. But it didn't just change him also was it was also moving on other men too. And the gospel was being uh was being printed and and then the presence of the Lord was was was being it was it was God moving. Are y'all understanding WHAT I'M SAYING? SO it is in this last day. God is calling the church. Amen. God is calling this elect. He's he's he now he's pronouncing judgment upon the the HE'S PRONOUNCING JUDGMENT UPON AND AND I'M NOT MAKING THAT AND HARLOTS UP. That's in the Bible. Y'all know that, right? That's that's that's all throughout the book of Revelation. HE'S JUDGING THEM, BUT HE'S ALSO SAYING THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY [screaming] THAT'S GOING TO WASH THEIR EYES with Isa, listen to the voice of that messenger as he begins TO DECREE AND CRY out &gt;&gt; there. Um, if you wouldn't mind putting up um Malachi 4 and the first verse, [snorts] this is talk this is right at the end. And this is this is God talking about the about about me and you. And and I'm closing. This is going to be my last scripture here. For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven. This is this is talking about when the earth shall burn as a fervent heat, and all the proud, yay, all that do wicked shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, sayaeth the Lord, that it shall leave neither them neither root nor branch. Amen. We're just going to keep on going. But unto you that fear my name, the son of righteousness shall arise. The son shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as cals in the stall. Ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes. This is talking about the millennium. For they shall be ashes unto the souls of your feet in that day that I shall do this sayaith the Lord of hosts. Remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to the uh fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. So we we can look here that there are specific promises that have been given. And I am out of time. But what I'm saying, the purpose was to turn our hearts back to the original. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come back to the original. &gt;&gt; And today you find any hardly a church member, they ain't none of them want to go back to the original. [laughter] But the hearts of the children, &gt;&gt; the ones who came from God, the ones that's going back to God, they're needing to hear something. They're needing to hear a voice saying, "John, John, YOU'RE BLIND. JOHN, YOU'RE IN LEOSA. [screaming] COME OUT AND I WILL ACCEPT YOU TO MYSELF. &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH IS GOING TO HELL [laughter] IN A HAND BASKET, BUT COME ON OUT." &gt;&gt; YEAH, BROTHER. COME back to the original. &gt;&gt; You love it. &gt;&gt; If the musicians would come. Thanks for your patience this morning. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY to God. I'm glad I heard it, buddy. I was I was a Pentecostal. I I I Well, I'm still Pentecostal in experience, but I was I was I Hallelujah. We we seen all kinds of stuff. I I saw miracles, healings, but there was [music] but there was so much junk involved. My faith could not ever rise to the occasion. It was it was under the [snorts] dictates of men here and there. Then I'd find out that my goodness, you know, the group that we fellowshipped with, I mean, you know, I don't guess they felt like there was enough laws in the Bible, so they they just made up laws, you know. and uh came came to church one time with a with with my hair parted in the middle and hallelujah. [music] Didn't think I was ever going to get out of purgatory for that one. But when you come, you find out when the book begins to open and as you begin to look at these symbols that begin to open and you begin to see everything that's in here, you begin to see all the mystery come together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you for pulling me out." Well, where are you taking me to? What denomination? There is no denomination. Well, who where are we going? [music] To Jesus Christ, the word. &gt;&gt; That's who our messenger has pointed us to. Back to Christ. You're in his arms today. You're not in mine. In fact, God ain't going to have no manhandling of his word anymore. [music] And he ain't going to have his bride being manhandled by any by any by any theologian or any man. When God wants to speak, he will send a prophet and that prophet will come and back it up with thus sayeth the Lord and it'll be a vindicated word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because he wants you he wants your [music] faith to be solid in that almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. When John the Baptist come, he said, "Behold, behold the lamb of God." Only that was a that [music] was a that was a good amen. So the the [music] the the holy John was the was the messenger. John was the one that there in Malachi or Malachi 2. Malachi 3 talked of [music] of John coming to forrun Jesus. Isaiah spoke of him coming. A voice crying in the wilderness. Here come John. And the Bible says that John came out of the wilderness eating [clears throat] locust and honey. [music] And he was wrapped in sheep skin. His mother and father were old. Zachchariah and Elizabeth. They died when he was around 9 years old. And he went out in the wilderness is what is what the Josephus and the historians [music] say. And then he comes out maybe not having a bath in days, maybe not having a bath in months. He came out had hair all over him [laughter] and he's and he's out he's out there in the river Jordan and he says repent for he's coming. Repent. They all laughed laughed at him. But the Lord had already told him, "The one that you see the spirit descending upon, he's the one." And one day here Jesus came and he saw that [music] light following him. And he said, "Behold the lamb of God." [laughter] They're all looking at him. That that illegitimate child, that supposed son of Joseph. And who are you? Hair all over him. Hairy man. He stunk. But Jesus came to his prophet. met his prophet right there in the water. John says, "Hey, listen. I'm not worthy to baptize you. I'm not even worthy to unloose your your your sho strings." Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so." [music] Why? Because the lamb always had to be washed before it could be go into service. [music] He had to Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So here come HERE COME THE MESSIAH TO the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Now the Bible says [music] that that John that they got all they all got they all got a little bit disoriented got a little bit got a little bit uptight about it because all of John's disciples were leaving and following Jesus. Jesus and and John says I must [music] decrease &gt;&gt; that he may increase. Now what I am saying here today [music] is this is a special day of all days. &gt;&gt; This is an introduction not to another church age but our prophet has introduced [music] us to the groom. This is rapturing time. &gt;&gt; This is a time of preparation. [music] I say, "God, I'm anointed for the season." I thank God. I thank God for his messenger. [music] And I I wish I would have had more time, but I don't. So, we won't we just stand to our feet and appreciate your patience here this morning. Praise the Lord. God is so good. &gt;&gt; God is so good to us. Huh? But in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, when he shall begin to sound, when John the Baptist started declaring, "This is him. [music] It was over. Jesus was no longer a mystery. The prophet identified him." Now, whether everyone else was going to accept it, that's another story. But he was identified. &gt;&gt; There came a message in our day to identify Christ [music] and his mystery. Where is Christ? Who is he identifying? The bride. &gt;&gt; Identifying the bride. &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? Maybe I didn't bring that that last part in the way it was. [music] It was the identification of the groom. And then today is the identification of the bride. Christ [music] in his bride. That's what God is trying to show. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, we're dependent upon him. Yes, we've got to have him. Yes, we want to hear him. [music] Amen. He means everything to us. God richly bless you. &gt;&gt; What are you playing there, Brother Kobe? &gt;&gt; Calling [singing] out [music] Babylon. to a higher grave. [music] There is a mountain I [singing] can live upon. I have made [music and singing] my choice. Jesus is my joy. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Jesus. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
