[28:54] little bit on
[28:55] Ministry uh I I want to um Minister a
[29:00] little bit this evening on on um on how
[29:05] that um dressing our our dress is a
[29:11] testimony of the um of of the land that
[29:14] we came from it's a testimony of the
[29:18] Holiness of God and and CU all of us
[29:22] want something to do for the Lord and
[29:25] and I think we we all do I I I want to
[29:28] be about the father's business and um
[29:32] and so a as we uh think about this here
[29:35] tonight my title standing your ground
[29:39] against this this evil age of
[29:43] darkness and and we may not be Jesus
[29:48] amen he was the light of the world but
[29:50] then he turned around and said you're
[29:52] the light of the world and so though you
[29:55] may not be you're you're not Jesus none
[29:58] of us are claiming to be Jesus but yet
[30:01] each of us are reflecting his light and
[30:03] his power amen the scripture says uh
[30:07] there in in Isaiah the the 60th chapter
[30:10] arise Shine for thyl has come and the
[30:15] glory of the Lord the es uh the the the
[30:21] eso in amen is risen upon you and
[30:25] darkness shall cover the Earth behold
[30:27] gross Darkness the people but the Lord
[30:30] is risen upon you the moon amen you're
[30:34] the we're we're a type of the Sun and
[30:36] the Moon Sun being Christ Moon being the
[30:39] church amen and His glory shall be seen
[30:44] upon you and and so amen it is with the
[30:48] ministry of the Moon brother brandham
[30:50] would say the moon and the son is
[30:52] husband and wife and while the son is
[30:54] going away it is it shows
[30:57] its light against the moon to give us a
[31:00] smaller light until the sun comes and
[31:03] when the sun
[31:05] comes uh when when the sun comes let's
[31:08] see um the moon Fades out and Christ is
[31:12] the sun who's gone to glory and shining
[31:15] on the church with the same light the
[31:17] same kind of light he shined when he was
[31:19] here and the church is the light of the
[31:21] world until Jesus comes and it all melts
[31:24] together like the Moonlight and the
[31:26] sunlight become one light when it
[31:28] emerges together when Christ and his
[31:30] church comes together at the great
[31:32] Millennium then they emerge into one
[31:36] praise the Lord so amen we we have a a
[31:39] great call it's a great purpose and I
[31:43] say today in in the in in this hour of
[31:46] Darkness it is it is time for the moon
[31:49] to persevere amen don't be overcome by
[31:54] Darkness amen but you overcome amen the
[31:58] world in spite of the darkness because
[32:01] the people need you they need that
[32:03] reflection they need to know the Eternal
[32:05] land they need to know that there is
[32:08] someone that believes the Bible and that
[32:10] the Bible is still has the power of God
[32:13] under salvation I am not ashamed of the
[32:15] Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the
[32:17] power of God under salvation and so you
[32:20] as the believer you reflect the power of
[32:24] God by reflecting his light amen you
[32:27] reflect it through through through your
[32:30] lifestyle you know Peter said there in
[32:33] Acts 2 and 40 amen there at the end he
[32:36] said save yourselves from this onward
[32:40] generation in other words save yourself
[32:44] from amen this this this generation of
[32:48] sin but then there in in the book of uh
[32:51] 2 Peter 3 and 3 it says knowing this
[32:55] first that there shall come in the last
[32:57] days scoffers and these scoffers are
[33:00] going to walk after their own lust and
[33:02] they're going to say that God doesn't
[33:04] mean what he what he meant and and and
[33:07] their love for truth is not going to be
[33:10] where it is but the but the but this the
[33:14] church has got a greater responsibility
[33:17] that when the church nominal uh H uh
[33:21] forsakes the word and loses their light
[33:24] that is the greatest opportunity for the
[33:27] bride of Christ to reflect her light to
[33:31] this dying generation amen I think today
[33:34] your responsibility is greater in this
[33:37] day than it has ever been
[33:39] before amen the responsibility of light
[33:43] is greater in this day the scripture
[33:45] says because iniquity shall abound the
[33:49] love of many shall wax cold amen but he
[33:53] says but he that endureth to thee the
[33:57] end shall be saved and then he says and
[34:01] the gospel the of the Kingdom shall be
[34:05] preached and in all the world for a
[34:08] witness unto all nations and then shall
[34:11] the End come and so there's where we are
[34:14] iniquity is bounding amen the love for
[34:17] the gospel is not there anymore
[34:19] Hallelujah but we've got to endure and
[34:24] shine that light now when you think
[34:27] about iniquity amen how is it that that
[34:30] that what what does iniquity mean is
[34:33] that brother Brandon would say it's not
[34:35] just a sinner out the road but really uh
[34:39] iniquity is is is really applied to the
[34:42] church because you know to do something
[34:46] and you don't do it amen and and he said
[34:49] it many places but here he says David
[34:51] said if I conceive iniquity in my heart
[34:53] God will not hear me see iniquity is
[34:56] some something you know that you ought
[34:59] to do and you won't do it you know
[35:02] better but you won't do it it's iniquity
[35:05] amen he says it's right before you that
[35:08] you shouldn't do it and that is Iniquity
[35:12] so so here we stand today in in this
[35:15] when it's so dark amen it's dark in the
[35:19] regular world and it's dark in the
[35:22] Christian world Amen because the light
[35:25] has been forsaken
[35:27] not just by those Sinners out there but
[35:30] it's been forsaken in the
[35:33] church in the church nominal amen and so
[35:36] we we see that amen there in 1 Timothy
[35:39] 4:1 it says in the latter times or the
[35:42] spirit speaketh expressly that in the
[35:44] latter times some shall depart from the
[35:48] faith 2 Thessalonians 2 and 3 let no man
[35:51] deceive you by any means but that day
[35:53] shall not come except there be come a
[35:56] falling
[35:57] away first so we can see here today that
[36:02] this gross Darkness amen it it is
[36:05] covering denominations it's covering uh
[36:09] Nations it's covering it there's it
[36:12] doesn't matter whether you're rich
[36:13] you're poor it doesn't matter whether
[36:15] you're a preacher whether you're a saint
[36:18] amen this darkness is covering the world
[36:22] and if there's ever been a time that we
[36:25] need the ministry of light this is the
[36:29] day to
[36:30] shine amen hallelujah amen he says now
[36:35] he says the prophet has said Gross
[36:37] Darkness upon the people and the people
[36:39] of the world gross Darkness have you
[36:40] noticed in the last few years some of
[36:42] you men and women around my age and how
[36:45] each year it seems like darker and
[36:47] darkness comes more and more I was
[36:49] speaking about this the other day and my
[36:51] wife you know it seems like as the years
[36:53] go on it just seems like the people
[36:55] begin to get further and further away
[36:57] from the real thing and and that they
[36:59] should be getting closer and closer to I
[37:01] notice men I look at on the streets and
[37:03] and among them women and and what's
[37:05] their desires and what they like to do
[37:07] and they're changing attitudes all the
[37:09] time men are becoming more like women
[37:11] women are becoming more like men and it
[37:13] seems there's no way to stop it across
[37:15] the nation preaching against the thing
[37:17] and and come back the next year and it's
[37:19] worse than it was when I started them
[37:22] people want to do right but there's
[37:24] something about it that won't let them
[37:25] do right just presses down on them
[37:28] forces them it's like a heavy dark fog
[37:32] upon the whole church or the whole earth
[37:34] not only in Phoenix but all over the
[37:35] world there seems to be just a groping
[37:39] Darkness that's Gathering amen Gathering
[37:41] more dense and dense all the time just
[37:44] smothering out the real manhood the real
[37:46] Womanhood I'm talking in in the natural
[37:49] now and it comes more and more in the
[37:51] churches and then when you raise up and
[37:54] say something against it then they
[37:56] condemn you for it and and you can you
[37:58] can see it coming and then when you
[38:00] speak against it somebody misunderstands
[38:03] it sometimes women understands it men
[38:05] misunderstand it and they take the wrong
[38:07] attitude and Men sometimes good men have
[38:10] to cope with such things in order to
[38:11] hold their life in the religious ranks
[38:14] that they belong to it's because they're
[38:16] excommunicated and then they're on their
[38:18] own and and so brother bradam was saying
[38:21] as a prophet he he could say this
[38:23] Darkness he could he could say this PR
[38:26] ing against the people Amen to to come
[38:31] under its pressure come under its form
[38:35] but brother we are not of the night
[38:37] we're not of the darkness amen we are of
[38:40] the light we're Children of the light
[38:43] can you say amen amen and God loves to
[38:46] test his people Amen brother Brandon
[38:48] would say and when the but when the
[38:50] testing of his word is over then we are
[38:53] taken up to this body that was prepared
[38:55] for us before the foundation of the
[38:56] world it is the word there that we skip
[38:58] that we could come by and be tempted and
[39:01] tested so I want to speak here tonight
[39:04] the importance amen of reflecting that
[39:08] Holiness amen and I think the greatest
[39:11] thing that we could do is to reflect it
[39:14] accurately as as the scripture gives it
[39:16] to us how many believ that's
[39:18] right amen we we talk about the morning
[39:22] star and amen and how how it's the
[39:25] brightest right at the dark right at the
[39:27] at the darkest of night amen it gets
[39:30] really dark before the be before the
[39:33] breaking of day and then that that that
[39:35] morning star begins to come out and I
[39:38] love the way brother Brandon puts it he
[39:40] says it hails it hails the arrival of
[39:43] the oncoming son amen it declares hang
[39:46] on because the new day is coming the new
[39:50] day is around the corner can you say
[39:52] amen and I believe the anointing that is
[39:56] is in this bride is declaring the S so n
[40:01] is coming I believe the anointing of the
[40:04] day I believe when you shine your light
[40:07] at the grocery store you are declaring
[40:09] the light is coming amen I when you when
[40:12] you shine your light on on the job you
[40:15] are declaring Jesus is coming we need to
[40:18] declare it more than we've ever declared
[40:21] it we should declare that Jesus is still
[40:25] alive he's in his bride and a physical
[40:29] return of Jesus Christ is coming Amen
[40:32] brother brenon would say what is it the
[40:34] Morning Star the Church of the Living
[40:36] God today who's the Watchman in in on
[40:39] the tower warning the Nations and the
[40:41] people it stands alone a man that stands
[40:43] for God stands alone what's he doing
[40:46] he's reflecting the same light of the
[40:48] Sun that went down years ago and is
[40:51] rising again what is that true Church's
[40:54] Ministry the ministry of that church
[40:57] will be the ministry of the son because
[40:59] it's reflecting the same power the same
[41:02] sunlight that the world will know that J
[41:06] that the sun rises what it'll look like
[41:09] I want to say I'm glad for this ministry
[41:11] I'm glad for this call I'm glad to be
[41:14] able to tell people that Jesus is coming
[41:18] and I have an authority to do so I I I
[41:21] believe every one of us amen should be
[41:23] laboring under the anointing of the Holy
[41:25] Spirit I believe our lives should be
[41:28] reflected amen otherwise our our our
[41:30] labors are in vain amen I believe that
[41:33] we should we should we should be
[41:35] thankful for the ministry I I I believe
[41:37] every time that amen you you you you
[41:40] ladies are are fixing your hair amen and
[41:43] wearing decent clothing and you men are
[41:46] amen not looking feminist and you know
[41:49] refusing to put the skinny jeans on and
[41:51] and and those kinds of things and and
[41:54] and and you know you you you should be
[41:56] thankful that that you this day are
[42:01] reflecting the Holiness of God it the
[42:05] decency of God the the attributes of God
[42:10] in this dark
[42:12] world Amen now now you can you can do
[42:16] those things I know a lot of people that
[42:19] can that that can look holy amen but if
[42:22] they haven't got the Messiah light
[42:23] flowing through them amen you know they
[42:27] they they uh brother Brandon put it I
[42:29] like the way he put it he says uh amen
[42:31] they look pretty all on the outside but
[42:32] yet Amen on the inside they they got a
[42:35] temper that that that that could fight a
[42:37] buz saw you know well that's not what
[42:39] we're wanting amen this is not something
[42:41] that is a religious act to us we want to
[42:44] reflect the gospel in the purity of the
[42:48] Holy Spirit flow through me Holy Spirit
[42:53] flow through
[42:55] me can you say Amen except the Lord
[42:58] build the house they that labor labor in
[43:00] vain except the Lord builth a wall they
[43:04] that build it build in vain can you say
[43:07] Amen so we are to flow with God and his
[43:11] plan amen because his plan is already
[43:14] set in stone and the willing and the
[43:17] obedient will eat the good thereof now
[43:21] what kind of a
[43:23] witness are are are we to be
[43:27] I think if there's ever a
[43:31] time for some holy looking folks on

[43:48] say Amen if there's ever been a time for
[43:51] you sisters to accurately represent this
[43:54] message it's now right and that's
[43:57] something that you need to you you you
[43:59] need to look at yourselves as you're
[44:01] doing so are you are you are you are you
[44:04] representing the message amen as the
[44:06] prophet brought it to us or are we are

[45:41] and sit in this chair and there wouldn't
[45:43] be anybody looking up your skirt come
[45:47] on well praise the Lord amen I I I think
[45:51] it's and I I I love our ladies around

[46:03] notice this they they they always cover
[46:06] themselves as they're doing that what

[46:36] and and and that all that is is
[46:38] flirtatious all that is is inviting
[46:41] something that is taking a man that is
[46:43] trying to be a Son of God in the church
[46:46] amen and and it and it causes him to
[46:48] have to go out and and and pray when he

[48:21] know about this one and that one that
[48:23] she's working for and and and and
[48:26] almost every one of them almost everyone
[48:29] that she has worked for and is currently
[48:31] working for amen they they they stop
[48:35] they ask her why she believes what she
[48:37] believes almost every one of them and
[48:40] and and she has just taken them right
[48:41] back to scripture and says well this is
[48:43] what the scripture says she's able to
[48:45] witness without ever saying a word
[48:50] because and someone tells me that the
[48:52] men well the poor women don't have a
[48:54] Ministry dear God you've got more of a
[48:56] Ministry than I spend
[49:00] do if you're willing to do it the way
[49:03] God want you to do it can you say Amen
[49:07] you are to reflect amen you're Heavenly
[49:10] bridegroom praise the Lord but the
[49:13] anointing will only rest upon the gentle
[49:18] nature and a gentle nature will always
[49:22] submit unto God that's now we can't
[49:27] expect amen you know if you're Gruff and
[49:30] stickery all the time and you're easily
[49:33] irritated and your bird and amen you
[49:36] always got to bur under your saddle and
[49:37] you got to correct everyone that that
[49:40] that that that SLS you the wrong way and
[49:42] that's the opposite of a lamb's
[49:44] nature that's the opposite of you know I
[49:47] got you they done me that oh dear God
[49:49] when are we going to grow up and let
[49:52] love Prevail amen when are when can we
[49:55] Overlook someone's faults someone's
[49:58] failures and let love Prevail in our
[50:02] lives I'm not talking on the women on
[50:04] that one I'm talking to you men can you
[50:06] say Amen you see don't expect the gentle
[50:10] Dove to rest upon a wild nature of a
[50:15] wolf that's right that's all the
[50:18] time all the time well you miss you're
[50:21] missing you're missing the lamb is
[50:24] self-sacrifice icing
[50:28] right squirrels can run up into a tree
[50:32] rabbits can hide in its den foxes can go
[50:36] to its Halls amen horses can kick wolves
[50:40] can can bite dogs can bite but
[50:47] sheep they have no protection that's
[50:52] right they're depending on a shepherd
[50:55] that's right their life is in the good
[50:58] Shepherd's hands right and that way the
[51:01] home is peaceful their heart is peaceful
[51:04] everything's peaceful well praise the
[51:06] lord well that was free amen now we
[51:10] brother Brandon would say we find out
[51:11] that this
[51:12] lamb
[51:14] simple he must be led look at the Lamb
[51:17] of God Here Comes Here Comes the dove
[51:19] coming from the lamb coming to the Lamb
[51:21] of God the dove is the most meekest bird
[51:24] of all Heavens the lamb is the meekest
[51:27] animal of all the Earth one of them is
[51:30] of the Earth the other one is of the
[51:31] heaven the lamb is Earthbound and can't
[51:33] fly the dove flies in the heavens one of
[51:36] them was Christ representing Christ the
[51:38] other was represented God now you see
[51:42] the lamb he's the innocent substitute he
[51:45] must be clean he must be innocent to be
[51:47] a substitute now the dove must also be
[51:50] of the same nature of the Lamb or they
[51:52] can't dwell together and that's the
[51:54] reason sometimes that we get get all
[51:55] mixed up is because we got one kind of a
[51:58] nature wanting the dove to dwell on us
[52:01] now when the Dove came down and lit on
[52:04] the lamb what it uh uh what if the lamb
[52:07] would have snorted like a wolf you know
[52:09] what it would have happened the dove
[52:11] would have took its flight right now
[52:13] certainly he would he couldn't have
[52:15] stayed down there he he couldn't have
[52:18] because it must be the same type of
[52:20] Nature and if you want to be a Christian
[52:23] you've got to be a lamb if you're going
[52:25] to be a lamb you've got to get away from
[52:27] your own thoughts and just let the Holy
[52:30] Spirit do the leading why certainly amen
[52:33] now how many knows the Bible says those
[52:35] that are the led by the spirit of God
[52:38] these
[52:40] are the sons of God the Sons and
[52:43] Daughters of God brother bam says when
[52:45] the dove come come down from heaven was
[52:47] the meest of all birds came to the
[52:49] meekest animal all the Earth and Heaven
[52:51] and Earth kissed each other Heaven and
[52:53] Earth was United together man and God
[52:55] was reconciled in one body the Lord
[52:57] Jesus Christ certainly it was it was the
[53:00] god of Heaven in the form of a dove the
[53:03] Son of God in the form of a lamb and the
[53:05] dove come down upon the lamb and it abod
[53:07] upon him never just come down and lit
[53:09] and when way it stayed there it was
[53:13] satisfied and the lamb was satisfied to
[53:16] have the dove look at him being led of
[53:19] the father not my own will the father's
[53:21] will that sent me I come not to do my
[53:24] own will but the of him that sent me he
[53:26] says now the lamb can't lead itself but
[53:29] we call ourselves the God's lambs and we
[53:32] want to figure our own way out I'm going
[53:35] to see I'm going to see if I can stand
[53:38] that this or that or not you you you try
[53:41] to figure out on your own way and as
[53:44] soon as the dove comes and lights on you
[53:46] you try to figure out your own way and
[53:49] how you're going to do this and how
[53:50] you're going to do that and God can't
[53:53] lead you anymore so the dove just takes
[53:58] her flat can you say Amen so the
[54:03] characteristics of God's Lambs are what
[54:07] willing
[54:09] Hearts I think this is the greatest
[54:11] thing this to me is the is the key it's
[54:15] the key to Ministry it's the key to
[54:18] anything with God's word because it's
[54:21] coming at one it's coming to a mature
[54:26] where you are understanding why God puts
[54:30] things in his Bible it's you coming to
[54:33] the place where you trust God over your
[54:36] own and you're saying all right amen
[54:40] there's a reason you've said this

[56:41] the rain I am seeing who's in control of
[56:44] that heart even to give every man

[1:07:12] it's going to be in 1 Timothy 2
[1:07:14] and9 can y'all see
[1:07:17] that amen Now 1 Timothy 2:9 in like
[1:07:21] manner also that women Adorn themselves
[1:07:26] in modest
[1:07:27] apparel with shamefacedness and and
[1:07:31] sobriety not with braided hair or
[1:07:35] gold or pearls or costly array but which
[1:07:41] becometh women professing
[1:07:44] godliness with good works now I want us
[1:07:48] to look at this just real quickly
[1:07:50] because this is not can can you can
[1:07:54] Hallelujah I'm so used to pinching
[1:07:55] things up higher can you can you make
[1:07:57] that bigger or no okay amen
[1:08:00] hallelujah so the Greek word for
[1:08:04] apparel I want us to look there at
[1:08:06] modest apparel and when we look there at
[1:08:09] apparel it comes from it comes from the
[1:08:11] Greek word
[1:08:13] Casto and Casto means a long dress and
[1:08:18] if you break down the word cata is a
[1:08:22] garment flowing down
[1:08:26] stole is a long garment covering or
[1:08:31] wrapping modest comes from the word uh
[1:08:36] Cosmos which means orderly well arranged
[1:08:40] decent modest harmonious Arrangement or
[1:08:44] adornment so when we look here a long
[1:08:49] flowing
[1:08:51] orderly garment w well a well arranged
[1:08:56] dress now I I just thought I would check
[1:08:59] it out I just thought I'd I got on the
[1:09:01] internet and I
[1:09:02] said I said long flowing
[1:09:06] skirt and this is what it gave
[1:09:10] me show me a few others this is what
[1:09:13] they call long flowing
[1:09:18] skirt this this is what they
[1:09:21] say is a long
[1:09:24] flowing
[1:09:26] dress now the scripture says modest
[1:09:29] apparel and we' just shown you that it
[1:09:33] is a garment flowing down
[1:09:37] right it's it's a it's a it's a it's a
[1:09:41] and that stoy the again garment flowing
[1:09:44] down stoly is a long garment covering or
[1:09:46] or or wrapping so so where where where
[1:09:51] where do we get well I don't I I just
[1:09:54] get it long baby just get it long that's
[1:09:56] right
[1:09:58] right then you don't have to worry about
[1:10:01] it
[1:10:04] modest well arranged it's not tight
[1:10:07] fitting it's flowing right well praise
[1:10:12] the Lord
[1:10:15] now I know that this is coming back into
[1:10:18] style now you girls used to not my my
[1:10:20] wife had a hard time finding some some
[1:10:22] good stuff for a while
[1:10:24] but this is coming back into style long
[1:10:27] hair is coming back into style I
[1:10:28] understand that but don't you think
[1:10:31] don't you think that we ought to be
[1:10:33] doing it not because it's finally back
[1:10:34] in
[1:10:35] style but that we should be doing it
[1:10:38] because it's God style all along that's
[1:10:41] right and wouldn't it be bad if the
[1:10:43] world started looking like that and
[1:10:44] you're looking
[1:10:46] like the
[1:10:49] hussy come on let's let's let's let's
[1:10:53] let's do our part that's right the
[1:10:55] Sinners can look like that why why why
[1:10:57] why don't we do our part that's right
[1:10:59] right well praise the
[1:11:01] Lord from a heart that is pure long
[1:11:06] flowing can you say
[1:11:08] Amen you see now modesty
[1:11:12] also applies to one's demeanor or
[1:11:16] Behavior now these are the inward
[1:11:18] qualities of the heart how he or she
[1:11:21] presents themselves and yes this applies
[1:11:24] to men too now that word is used that
[1:11:27] that word is used two times in the New
[1:11:30] Testament amen that word Cosmos and it
[1:11:34] is it the next time that it is used it
[1:11:37] is it is it is actually used for us
[1:11:40] preachers and it says a bishop must be
[1:11:42] blameless the husband of one wife uh
[1:11:45] Vigilant sober and of good behavior
[1:11:48] which is that word cosmial a
[1:11:51] well-ordered life given to hospitality
[1:11:55] and apt to teach so so so therefore now
[1:11:59] going back to you uh uh uh go going back
[1:12:01] to you sisters therefore it is and once
[1:12:03] again it is not it's not you girls
[1:12:08] having to do it because your Mom and
[1:12:09] Daddy's telling you to do it listen we
[1:12:11] got a Rapture and you can't wait till
[1:12:13] you're my age and then to decide okay
[1:12:15] yeah I'm going to be holy but right now
[1:12:17] Mama's got to make me no no no no I want
[1:12:19] you kids to know what you're doing right
[1:12:22] now and if any of you Elders are guilty
[1:12:23] of it uh uh any anyone else in the well
[1:12:26] anyone in the room that's guilty of
[1:12:27] dressing amen that is not according to
[1:12:30] the message we need to straighten it
[1:12:32] up we got a
[1:12:35] Ministry but it's not it's not a have to
[1:12:40] but it's it's it's it's what you're
[1:12:41] doing you're singing according to
[1:12:43] scripture it's part of your nature the
[1:12:47] good behavior amen so so what what what
[1:12:51] this what this is saying is you're
[1:12:53] actions exhibits your belief system your
[1:12:58] dress your actions your behavior your
[1:13:01] attitudes all come from the heart and
[1:13:05] that's what the what God is wanting the
[1:13:06] world to see with Holiness that is deep
[1:13:09] down beded in the heart you want to run
[1:13:13] us far away from anything that would be
[1:13:15] close to what the world
[1:13:18] has can you say Amen now amen I I again
[1:13:24] I know many women had that never wear
[1:13:26] immodest clothing but then they're Brash
[1:13:29] they got a Brash
[1:13:30] demeanor they they run their house rule
[1:13:33] their
[1:13:34] husbands they're missing the point it's
[1:13:37] it's this here I know a lot of I know a
[1:13:40] lot of us guys that can look good amen
[1:13:43] it's easier for us to blend
[1:13:45] in but it uh Holiness is not something
[1:13:51] on this outward nature Holiness is not
[1:13:55] dresses Holiness is not long hair
[1:14:00] Holiness is not any of these things
[1:14:02] Holiness is what God has done in the
[1:14:05] heart to make you a new
[1:14:09] believer and it's because of the heart
[1:14:12] you operate that's right but if you
[1:14:16] don't have that heart then you will
[1:14:18] reject it no matter how many times I
[1:14:20] preach against it that's right it'll
[1:14:22] never be part of
[1:14:24] you cuz you ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:14:27] you've got to have something here that
[1:14:31] ready to express it
[1:14:33] here that's right orange seeds produce
[1:14:38] orange
[1:14:39] fruits can you say Amen
[1:14:43] now I want us to look at something let's
[1:14:45] look real quickly over here at at at U
[1:14:48] Peter 1 Peter 3 and 3 now I want you to
[1:14:52] look at this
[1:14:55] it says who is adorning let it not be
[1:14:56] the outward adorning of the plating of
[1:14:59] the hair wearing of gold putting on of
[1:15:03] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[1:15:06] the heart in that which is not
[1:15:09] corruptible even the ornament of a Meek
[1:15:12] and quiet Spirit which in the sight of
[1:15:13] God is a great prize for after this
[1:15:16] manner in the old time the holy women
[1:15:19] also who trusted in God adorned
[1:15:21] themselves being in subjection under
[1:15:22] their own husband
[1:15:24] even Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him
[1:15:26] Lord whose daughters you are as long as
[1:15:28] you do well and are not afraid with any
[1:15:31] amazement now Peter as
[1:15:35] Paul is pointing out the real Beauty now
[1:15:38] I'm not going to hold you too much
[1:15:40] longer tonight but he's pointing out the
[1:15:43] real
[1:15:44] Beauty now one point said the broed hair
[1:15:48] the other point it's it's it's saying
[1:15:51] the plating the hair now amen that that
[1:15:54] was a braid or a twisted hair that they
[1:15:58] would run it all the way up they they
[1:16:00] would go up as high as they could go
[1:16:01] with it and then they decked it with all
[1:16:04] gold and pearls and they and that's the
[1:16:06] reason why brother brandom says he's not
[1:16:09] talking about the the the braiding of
[1:16:12] your hair amen it was the part that it
[1:16:17] was they the way they were doing it and
[1:16:20] and all the gold and the jewels and the
[1:16:22] things were to
[1:16:24] attract were to
[1:16:26] attract and so amen and then he says you
[1:16:30] know the wearing of gold and and and and
[1:16:33] silver he says it's not it's not it's
[1:16:37] not that now amen again brother brandham
[1:16:42] says you know you you can wear a wedding
[1:16:45] band or something like that but don't
[1:16:47] look like you've went through a 10 cent
[1:16:49] store right amen you you can wear a
[1:16:54] necklace but but don't but don't look
[1:16:56] like it's you see we have a purpose for
[1:16:59] what we're doing our beauty is not
[1:17:07] this how is it that you girls are so
[1:17:09] beautiful in this
[1:17:12] building and you ain't got a bit of that
[1:17:14] Max Factor I don't know what Max Factor
[1:17:16] is I'm taking at the brother brandom
[1:17:17] know what he was talking
[1:17:21] about huh
[1:17:25] you you ain't got a you ain't got a you
[1:17:27] ain't got a none of that stuff on why
[1:17:31] because there's a peace on the inside of
[1:17:33] you and it's reflecting through your
[1:17:35] nature it's reflecting through your
[1:17:36] heart that's right I tell you
[1:17:39] man
[1:17:41] Hallelujah you you you you you get on
[1:17:43] the internet and you're looking at junk
[1:17:45] that and and and you're doing that to
[1:17:47] that and you're looking at stuff and and
[1:17:50] here you've got a wife that is remaining
[1:17:51] true and pure to you
[1:17:55] you I think there should be some
[1:17:57] lynches we got to be we we ought to be
[1:18:00] we ought to be faithful to our
[1:18:03] Wives come
[1:18:06] on we ought to be faithful to our
[1:18:10] wives you see when we when we look at
[1:18:14] this and you know you you you you say
[1:18:18] well brother wend you was talking about
[1:18:19] the lipstick and the fingernail polish
[1:18:21] and all of that and it is is that clear
[1:18:24] stuff is nothing but to attract
[1:18:29] attention you're painting your
[1:18:33] lips and you're missing the
[1:18:36] point brother Bram says we know that
[1:18:38] everything on Earth is a reflection of
[1:18:41] what's going on somewhere else you are
[1:18:44] only reflecting yourself what you are
[1:18:48] somewhere else is what you're reflecting
[1:18:50] here on the earth for if this Earth
[1:18:52] Earthly body be dissolved we have one
[1:18:55] already waiting we see we have one
[1:18:58] waiting just what are what you are
[1:19:00] somewhere else you are here now if you
[1:19:04] and your life isn't just correct here
[1:19:07] then your spiritual body is in a place
[1:19:10] that is not correct yet but if you got
[1:19:13] all your members submissive to God to
[1:19:16] God then what you are here you are
[1:19:20] reflecting somewhere else
[1:19:23] can you say Amen now
[1:19:27] amen I I think of
[1:19:31] Abraham as Abraham was offering his
[1:19:35] sacrifice unto the
[1:19:37] Lord and he had separated taken the
[1:19:39] sacrifice he had he had separated it and
[1:19:42] he was making that Covenant with
[1:19:45] God and and if you'll
[1:19:48] notice that as as he was there the
[1:19:52] scripture says the buzzards tried to
[1:19:54] start coming in and Landing upon that
[1:19:58] sacrifice and Abraham was
[1:20:02] diligent to shoe the buzzards away the
[1:20:05] birds away to shoe them away from from
[1:20:08] from that
[1:20:10] sacrifice there to shoot what what was
[1:20:13] they doing because brother bradam said
[1:20:14] the sacrifice had to remain
[1:20:17] pure had to remain
[1:20:20] clean he says and now that's what I'm
[1:20:23] trying to do now keep the old worldly
[1:20:27] Hollywood virt vultures out of the
[1:20:31] Pentecostal Church keep them out away
[1:20:34] from our women away from our brothers
[1:20:36] and things like that you can have all
[1:20:39] the big silly jokes and things you want
[1:20:41] to tell let them have it that's their
[1:20:43] Kingdom we're not of this world our
[1:20:47] kingdom is not of this world we live

[1:57:52] at the day of
[1:57:54] judgment what will people do who sit in
[1:57:57] the meetings what will people do that's
[1:57:59] seen the power of God that's heard the
[1:58:01] countdown on the word that's seen God
[1:58:04] manifest himself beyond a shadow of a
[1:58:06] doubt in every scripture fulfilled and
[1:58:09] will still try to make it heaven without
[1:58:10] being born again receive the Holy
[1:58:13] Ghost the Bible said if a righteous man
[1:58:15] scarcely
[1:58:18] saved where were the Sinner and the
[1:58:21] ungodly what kind of a place are we
[1:58:23] going to
[1:58:25] stand in if we see God unfold himself
[1:58:28] right before us and see the glory of God
[1:58:30] just the same as men did and that kind
[1:58:34] of men cried out as prophets and sages
[1:58:36] upon the word
[1:58:38] as if they cried and fell to the feet
[1:58:40] and
[1:58:41] screamed of a man of Unholy lips
[1:58:45] uncleanness what will it be for that man
[1:58:48] that won't convince
[1:58:50] confess his
[1:58:51] sins what will it be for the teenager
[1:58:53] that won't confess his or her sins what
[1:58:55] will it be for the hardened man that
[1:58:58] thinks he knows more about God's
[1:58:59] creation than God does
[1:59:01] himself what will happen to that man
[1:59:03] that spent all of his life trying to
[1:59:05] disprove the
[1:59:07] Bible where will this guy appear think
[1:59:10] of

[1:59:59] heart and we've all got to serve God
[2:00:01] according to the convictions of our
