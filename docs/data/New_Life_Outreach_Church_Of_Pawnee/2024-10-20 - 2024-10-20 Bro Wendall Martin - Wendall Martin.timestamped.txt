[33:43] therefore let us keep the feast not with
[33:46] the old leaven neither with the leaven
[33:49] of malice and wickedness but with the uh
[33:54] unleavened bread of sincerity
[33:58] and in
[33:59] truth now we understand that we are
[34:04] eating the words of life here
[34:07] today and um amen we are as we have been
[34:12] you know just dealing with um just
[34:15] little aspects to
[34:17] overcoming and um and tonight I want to
[34:22] um I I I just want
[34:25] to speak along the lines again of
[34:28] overcoming and uh taking all of the land
[34:31] we we want to take every bit of it there
[34:34] the the God had had promised Israel
[34:37] there uh and and and I and before I I I
[34:41] go into my thoughts here tonight I think
[34:43] sincerity eating this bread now first of
[34:47] all Israel's land was a natural land
[34:51] your land is the Holy Ghost and it's the
[34:55] the Holy Ghost is placing us in the book
[34:59] so you can't separate the holy ghost
[35:02] from the word it's the holy ghost that
[35:05] is placing you in the book the book is
[35:07] yours and so as Israel was given the
[35:12] promise to go into that land and as they
[35:16] are possessing the the land God promised
[35:20] them that all of the inhabitants he
[35:23] would go with them to drive out those
[35:26] inhabitants uh that were already in
[35:29] their land now that land was already
[35:32] there before the foundation of the world
[35:34] God already promised that in in uh to to
[35:38] uh Abraham he had promised it amen now
[35:41] we had gone through 400 years of uh of
[35:45] of of waiting and bondage but but the
[35:48] land was theirs nonetheless and I want
[35:51] to say tonight that everything that God
[35:55] has all that is provided in Jes Jesus
[35:58] Christ is your land every bit of it is
[36:01] yours you don't have to beg for it you
[36:03] don't have to ask for it the prophet
[36:05] even said you don't even have to pray
[36:07] for it it's yours just act in faith and
[36:11] possess it now amen and so uh uh is when
[36:17] they went to that land it was it was a
[36:20] promise and that there in Exodus 23 and
[36:23] 20 it says and behold I send an angel
[36:27] before for thee to keep thee in the way
[36:29] to bring thee into the place which I
[36:32] have prepared God's already prepared the
[36:37] place for Israel amen all they're going
[36:40] to have to do is just be willing they're
[36:43] going to have to have some fire in the
[36:45] gut they're going to have to have
[36:47] something that is that they want it more
[36:49] than anything else and if they're
[36:51] willing to do it amen God says I will go
[36:54] before you amen and and he says Be
[36:57] beware of him obey his voice provoke him
[37:00] not for he will not pardon your
[37:01] transgressions for my name is in him but
[37:03] if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and
[37:05] do all that I speak then I will be an
[37:08] enemy unto your enemies and an adversary
[37:12] unto your adversaries amen that is a
[37:16] promise unto the Lord amen by the Lord
[37:19] to you and and he says for my angel
[37:22] shall go before thee bring thee in unto
[37:26] the amorites the hitti the perizzites
[37:28] the Canaanites the hivites and the
[37:30] jebusites and I will cut them off that
[37:36] is a promise now but now we find that as
[37:41] as Israel went in that that Israel uh
[37:46] did not uh dispossess all of the land
[37:49] did you know that amen now God gave them
[37:52] that land and and it was something that
[37:55] God had already prepared for them
[37:58] amen but because they did not have um
[38:02] that that that diligence in their heart
[38:05] to possess everything that God told them
[38:08] they could possess amen then then we
[38:11] found out that that that there was many
[38:13] of the zebus sites and many of the
[38:15] Hittites and many of these guys that
[38:18] were left in and God had already told
[38:20] them amen uh uh uh if you were to look
[38:23] there in in uh numbers 33 and 5 W he
[38:27] already gave them a promise that if they
[38:29] did not take it all he says speak unto
[38:31] the children of Israel and say unto them
[38:34] when you are passed over Jordan in the
[38:36] land of Canaan then ye shall drive out
[38:39] all the inhabitants of the land from
[38:42] before you and destroy all their
[38:43] pictures destroy their ment images and
[38:46] quite pluck down all their high places
[38:49] you shall dispossess the inhabitants of
[38:52] the land and dwell therein for I have
[38:55] given you the land to possess it you
[38:58] shall divide the land by lot for an
[39:00] inheritance among your families and to
[39:03] and to the more you shall give the more
[39:05] inheritance to the fewer you shall give
[39:07] the less inheritance Every Man's
[39:09] inheritance shall be in the place where
[39:11] his lot falleth according to the tribes
[39:14] of of your fathers um shall inherit it
[39:18] but if you will not drive out the
[39:21] inhabitance of the land before you then
[39:23] it shall come to pass that those which
[39:26] ye let remain of them shall be Pricks in
[39:30] your eyes thorns in your side and shall
[39:35] Vex you in the land wherein you dwell so
[39:40] I'm taking you to this land I I'm giving
[39:44] you this land I promise you that my
[39:47] angel is with you to drive out the
[39:50] inhabitants amen you just got to rely on
[39:53] me I'm I'm going to I'm going to lead
[39:56] you into battle can you say Amen but if
[39:59] you do not drive them out they're going
[40:01] to be Pricks in your eyes thorns in your
[40:03] side amen a and they're you're going to
[40:05] have to live with that enemy and how
[40:07] many knows that amen that that Israel
[40:10] the Philistines and the amorites and all
[40:11] of these amen they were Pricks to Israel
[40:15] amen they they were because Israel amen
[40:18] we find that that when Joshua is an old
[40:20] man if you were to go back in in uh at
[40:24] the end of Joshua there I believe it's
[40:27] Jos Joshua 20 amen where where Joshua
[40:29] was is an old man now and and and and
[40:33] the Bible says amen that there was still
[40:36] much land for Israel to possess it did
[40:40] not say that God did not give the land
[40:43] because Joshua done his job Joshua gave
[40:46] the land amen set it out there for all
[40:48] of Israel all of the tribes to possess
[40:51] but we find that Israel did not have the
[40:55] same um uh the the the the the same you
[40:58] know uh uh uh staying power that God had
[41:03] amen God was willing to take when he
[41:05] left them from Israel or or from Egypt
[41:07] and he and he dropped the plages and he
[41:10] and and he and he brought them through
[41:11] the 40 Years of wilderness God was in it
[41:13] for the long
[41:14] haul amen even though God was upset a
[41:17] time or two and and really to take them
[41:19] all out and here Moses steps up and amen
[41:21] but God was willing to take them all the
[41:24] way through to the journey to make sure
[41:26] the predestin seed would get there is
[41:28] that right but when they got to that
[41:31] land not everyone possessed it amen I I
[41:34] was looking there in judges uh um judges
[41:37] 1
[41:39] and excuse me uh 19 it says the Lord was
[41:43] with Judah and he drave out all uh or
[41:47] drave out the inhabitants of the
[41:48] mountain but could not drive out the
[41:50] inhabitants of the valley because they
[41:52] had Chariots of iron and they gave Hein
[41:55] unto Caleb a as Moses said and his and
[41:58] he expelled then the three sons of Anan
[42:02] and then the 21st verse the children of
[42:03] Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites
[42:06] that inhabited Jerusalem but the
[42:07] jebusites dwell with the children of
[42:10] Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day the
[42:13] house of jodah uh Joseph they also went
[42:16] up against bethl and the Lord was with
[42:19] them and the house of Joseph sent uh to
[42:22] describe bethl now the name of the city
[42:25] before was l and the spies saw a man and
[42:28] come forth out of the city and they said
[42:31] unto him show us we pray thee the
[42:33] entrance into the City and we will show
[42:35] thee mercy and when he showed them the
[42:36] entrance they smote the city with the
[42:38] edge of the sword but let go the man and
[42:41] all his family and the man went into the
[42:43] land of the Hittites and built a city
[42:45] and called the name thereof L which is
[42:48] the name thereof until this day neither
[42:51] did Manasseh drive out all the
[42:53] inhabitants of Basim and of her towns
[42:56] nor of
[42:57] tanac and her hounds nor the inhabitants
[43:01] of D and her towns nor the inhabitants
[43:04] of ium and her towns nor the inhabitants
[43:07] of Meo megadoo uh and her towns nor but
[43:10] the Canaanites would dwell in that land
[43:13] and it came to pass when Israel was
[43:15] strong that they put the Canaanites to
[43:17] Tribute and did not utterly drive them
[43:20] out now God gave them this promise I'm
[43:24] going to go before you and if you'll
[43:27] obey and you'll take it I will be an
[43:30] enemy to your enemy I'll be an
[43:33] Hallelujah but the scripture says they
[43:36] had to fight to destroy and many did not
[43:41] have gut in uh fire in the gut they they
[43:44] they were yellowbellies they didn't have
[43:46] what it took to fight to press on to get
[43:50] their Victory and I want to tell you
[43:52] today amen not going to hold you long
[43:54] tonight but I'm going to tell you amen I
[43:56] am not going to allow any spirits of
[44:00] unbelief to keep me from this finality
[44:03] if God says I can have it then I'm going
[44:07] to possess it amen I don't care how hard
[44:10] I have to fight I don't care how hard I
[44:13] have to press on amen God says to take
[44:17] this book to eat this book and he would
[44:20] Empower me to speak those words of
[44:23] Promise amen and overcome the enemy in
[44:26] my life now I think that's the way that
[44:28] we should all be amen is God give me
[44:31] give me the courage give me the humility
[44:36] a give me the eyesight the vision to
[44:39] follow through with what God has
[44:41] promised me amen now if you were to go
[44:43] one down amen it it it says in the 29th
[44:46] verse neither did Ephraim drive out the
[44:48] Canaanites that dwell in um
[44:51] gazer but the Canaanites dwelt in gizer
[44:54] among them uh uh neither did zebulun
[44:57] drive out the inhabitants of uh aitran
[45:00] nor the inhabitants of nahala uh but the
[45:04] Canaanites dwelt among them and they
[45:06] become tributaries neither did Asher
[45:09] drive out the inhabitants of AKO nor the
[45:12] inhabitants of zidon nor of alab nor of
[45:16] isib nor of halba uh nor of epec AIC nor
[45:22] of RAB but the ashit dwelt among the
[45:25] Canaanites and the inhabitants of the
[45:27] land for they did not drive them out
[45:30] neither did neph drive out the
[45:32] inhabitants of Beth shimes nor the
[45:35] inhabitants of Beth uh but but he dwelt
[45:39] among the Canaanites the inhabitants of
[45:41] the land nevertheless the inhabitant of
[45:44] be uh whatever and and be hath uh became
[45:48] tributaries un them and the amorites
[45:50] forced the the children of Dan into the
[45:53] mountains for they could not suffer them
[45:56] to come to the
[45:57] but the amorites would dwell in the
[45:59] mounts of hers in ageline and in Shel uh
[46:04] shelan yet the hand of the House of
[46:06] Joseph prevailed so that they become
[46:09] tributaries so so we could we could just
[46:12] we could see here amen that though God
[46:15] gave the promise how many believes God
[46:17] give the did we not read that God gave
[46:18] him the promise how many believes God
[46:21] was able to do whatever it
[46:23] took hallelujah amen go God says that he
[46:27] would rain down hell if you go back and
[46:29] read through the Bible in those times
[46:31] when they were overcoming amen God would
[46:33] rain down hell he would he would he was
[46:36] doing all sending winds in he was doing
[46:39] all kinds of things Israel had to fight
[46:44] but God was but God would would give
[46:48] them the victories in their lives and so
[46:51] it is today amen as we are as we are
[46:54] here looking at the
[46:57] at this last stage of the journey I
[47:00] don't want to leave one inch of ground
[47:03] if God says I can possess the land don't
[47:06] you tell me that I can't have it if God
[47:10] says amen that I can live in power in
[47:13] Victory and that this church is going to
[47:15] be the most powerful Church of all the
[47:17] Seven Ages then buddy I'm standing up
[47:20] and saying God Count Me In I am willing
[47:23] for you to use me anoint me Hallelujah I
[47:28] I am I'm willing to step up and say that
[47:30] God is more than able Amen to give my
[47:33] daddy a a a brand new health right here
[47:36] before the Rapture I I am here to tell
[47:39] you that God can still give brand new
[47:41] livers I'm here to tell you that God can
[47:44] still save the alcoholics I'm here to
[47:46] tell you I am not willing to lay down in
[47:50] defeat when the Bible has been opened up
[47:54] to me
[47:57] Hallelujah he oh can you say Amen
[48:00] Victory to the people because God gave
[48:03] it to
[48:05] you amen hallelujah I I I that's the way
[48:10] that's the way it's got to be amen you
[48:12] look at the land of Israel where they're
[48:14] at today go back and look at the Bible
[48:16] what God gave to Abraham amen and what
[48:19] God gave and and the way that he laid it
[48:22] out to uh uh to to um Moses amen did you
[48:25] know that Israel still has a lot of land
[48:27] that that that that they are to
[48:30] possess amen amen yeah if you go back
[48:34] and look at the map uh you know there's
[48:36] a reason why those devils are doing what
[48:38] they're doing over there is because
[48:40] Israel owns a lot of that land amen a
[48:43] lot of that is still their land and
[48:44] Israel still has some possession to do
[48:47] amen it is hallelujah now I don't know
[48:50] amen maybe it's maybe they're not going
[48:52] to get it until amen the Millennium but
[48:54] I want to tell you God gave it to them
[48:56] and they could have it amen but they
[48:58] have been passive too long but I I can
[49:00] sense an urgency taking place over there
[49:02] in Israel amen something's going on
[49:04] they're getting a little bit of fire in
[49:06] the belly and said I I'm willing to
[49:08] fight I am sick of this I am tired of
[49:10] this I want Victory and I want to say
[49:13] tonight as a as a Son of God God gave me
[49:16] my land I'm not doing anything but
[49:18] living on my land and if Satan don't
[49:21] like it amen he can jump in the lake of
[49:23] fire amen I've got a promise and I'm
[49:26] going to St stand upon that word of God
[49:28] I'm going to believe and God's going to
[49:30] drive the enemy
[49:33] out
[49:35] now it's
[49:37] interesting that brother brandom in just
[49:40] just as the as the opening of the seals
[49:44] where he was as the Lord Was preparing
[49:46] him for the opening of the seals and and
[49:50] and he was he was still um
[49:54] uh the Lord was was showing him and he
[49:58] and he's and he's talking about it in
[49:59] Paradox there in Jeffersonville and he
[50:02] and he's talking about how he fell into
[50:03] a vision and um and and it looked like
[50:07] he was standing he says it looked like I
[50:08] was standing on the on the map of
[50:10] Palestine and and he says he was he was
[50:13] on this side of Jordan looking into the
[50:15] promised land amen and and looking
[50:18] across and he said and and this is what
[50:21] he said in the vision oh praise God over
[50:24] there is the promise there's where the
[50:27] promises of God are and and so he's
[50:30] standing on this side of Jordan looking
[50:32] over and saying the promises are there
[50:35] and and matters of fact he says I looked
[50:37] across the Jordan and I said oh praise
[50:38] God just on the other side is where all
[50:41] the promises lay every promise lays in
[50:45] that promised land now he is now the
[50:48] Lord is preparing him for this and
[50:50] there's a reason why I I took that
[50:52] familiar passage of scripture there in
[50:54] in Revelations the the 10th chapter
[50:57] because the Lord is is is preparing him
[51:00] for the opening of the word to the elect
[51:02] now this isn't see because the opening
[51:04] of the word is not for us just uh H uh
[51:06] it's not a mental thing it is your
[51:10] possession it's your place of authority
[51:13] it's God telling you you have legal
[51:17] rights not the jebusites amen not not
[51:20] all of those Canaanites and all of those
[51:22] other guys you and you alone have the
[51:25] land I've prepared it for you but there
[51:29] is enemy on your
[51:32] land now I I and now listen to me amen
[51:37] we can dilly dally around with Satan all
[51:40] we want we can dilly dally around with
[51:42] feelings all we want or we can come
[51:45] together with a heart of faith and
[51:49] something that is that is that is
[51:51] driving us in and and possess this land
[51:55] as we walk into to the
[51:57] Rapture well praise the Lord amen now
[52:01] now he brother brandham as he's he did
[52:03] at first he didn't know whether there
[52:04] was in a vision or dream and so we
[52:06] thought well maybe I dreamed it because
[52:08] it was at night and and when he came to
[52:10] himself he amen he was uh you know he he
[52:14] he he was sitting in a in a
[52:17] chair and uh and then as he sitting
[52:20] there wondering if if that was a vision
[52:21] or a dream all of a sudden it came back
[52:24] again and then he knew that it was a
[52:26] vision and he says then when I come into
[52:28] this Vision again it seemed I was lifted
[52:31] up sitting on a highway a narrow Highway
[52:34] with some brother and I I never knew who
[52:37] the brother was I looked around and I
[52:39] said now I'm I am sure and know that
[52:42] this is a vision the Lord God is here
[52:45] and it seemed like everybody was afraid
[52:47] I said what's everybody so afraid of and
[52:50] the voice came and said there's such
[52:52] danger in these days there's such
[52:55] hideous things that uh thing that deaths
[52:58] uh uh when it strikes you now I now
[53:01] listen Hallelujah I think I think the
[53:03] Lord is described where we're at right
[53:05] here right now I I I I I I believe the
[53:08] Lord is amen the Lord was letting him
[53:10] know the condition uh when the opening
[53:13] of this word would come and it says and
[53:15] a voice and a voice said there there's
[53:17] such danger in these days great hideous
[53:19] thing that death when when it strikes
[53:21] you and I heard weeds am masing down and
[53:24] I looked and here come A huge monster
[53:26] snake crawling through the weeds and I
[53:28] thought now knowing this is a
[53:30] vision then I shall see what this animal
[53:34] or this Beast is he crawled up on the
[53:36] highway and as soon as I got sight of
[53:38] him I knew it was a Mamba now a Mamba is
[53:42] an African snake which is the most
[53:44] deadly bite of all things there is
[53:46] there's nothing as poison as a Mamba the
[53:48] snake of course represents sin and death
[53:51] see and there we have in this country
[53:53] the rattlesnake the copperhead the
[53:55] cotton mouth moccasin uh many of these
[53:57] these snakes that if you're in bad
[53:59] health and want to bite you it perhaps
[54:01] kill you but but if you didn't get Aid
[54:03] uh of something right quick and then
[54:07] um uh uh it says then we go into Africa
[54:11] African India and we find the Cobra
[54:13] there's a black cobra that's a that's a
[54:15] bad snake it's a death bite too and
[54:17] there's a yellow Cobra Which is far
[54:19] beyond him yellow Cobra the patient dies
[54:21] with such a horrible death it dies from
[54:23] Suffocation and paralyzes the breathing
[54:25] system the can't breathe they they just
[54:28] open their mouth and gasp and trying to
[54:30] and die like that and and that was the
[54:33] type of snake that just one lick from
[54:35] getting Billy Paul and when when we got
[54:37] the snake in Africa and it and then
[54:40] comes the Mamba he's deaf he's so fast
[54:43] you can't see him he goes over the top
[54:45] of the weeds and prevails himself W with
[54:47] the back of his tail and just then he's
[54:50] gone he hits you in the face usually and
[54:52] stands up high and Strikes hard and when
[54:54] he hits you uh you just you just got a
[54:57] few breaths and and and you're finished
[54:59] it don't only paralyze you and get in
[55:00] your bloodstream it gets the nerves and
[55:02] everything you just die in a few seconds
[55:04] them native boys and track boys you you
[55:07] can you can say mama and they'll butt
[55:08] their heads together and scream because
[55:10] it's death in just a few moments in a
[55:12] few seconds when one hits you and here
[55:15] he was on the highway and I thought well
[55:18] th this is it so I looked at him and he
[55:21] looked angry at me and he licked his
[55:23] tongue and and and here he come but when
[55:26] he got close to me he would run up fast
[55:29] and then he would get slower and slower
[55:31] and just quiver and stop then something
[55:33] would hold him off and and he couldn't
[55:36] bite
[55:37] me he turned around on the other side
[55:40] and tried to
[55:43] approach and get back and and get a
[55:45] start and swish right towards me again
[55:47] and get slower and slower and slower and
[55:50] then I stop and then shake his head like
[55:52] that and move back he couldn't strike me
[55:54] then he turned and looked at my friend
[55:56] and I went away after my friend and I
[55:58] seen my friend just jumping way in the
[56:01] air and going over him and over him and
[56:03] over him and trying and the thing was
[56:05] striking at him and I thought oh if it
[56:06] ever hits him it'll be instant death no
[56:09] wonder everybody's so scared is because
[56:11] when this thing hits you it's an instant
[56:13] death and and I it was it was just
[56:16] striking at him like that I threw my
[56:18] hands up and I said oh God have mercy on
[56:21] my brother I said if that serpent ever
[56:23] strikes him it'll kill him now now I I
[56:27] want you to catch what what the Lord is
[56:29] showing because this is not
[56:31] just this is not just a normal vision
[56:35] God's or a normal dream God is
[56:38] specifically preparing the prophet amen
[56:42] for what this word was going to mean he
[56:46] says and just then the serpent turned to
[56:50] me when I said that and looked at me
[56:53] again and a voice came from above me and
[56:57] said you've been given power to bind him
[57:00] the worst or any I said well God what
[57:04] must I do he said there's one thing you
[57:06] must do amen you must be more
[57:15] sincere there's one thing you must do
[57:20] everyone say it with me you must be more
[57:25] sincere and then he says it again you
[57:28] must be more
[57:31] sincere and I saidwell God forgive me
[57:34] for my
[57:36] insincerity and let me have sincerity
[57:39] and when I raised my hands up to him
[57:41] again there was something there was a
[57:43] great something came over me just lifted
[57:48] me up it seemed like my whole body was
[57:53] charged with something does that not
[57:55] remind you of of what God done to Israel
[57:59] if if you were to have read that that
[58:01] full chapter there in Exodus amen he he
[58:05] says that I will send hell I will send
[58:07] plagues I will come in amen I will I
[58:12] will be a a a warrior for you amen and
[58:16] and God is God is charging this Prophet
[58:20] charging him now watch and he says and I
[58:22] looked at that and when I say charging
[58:24] charging him with his power
[58:27] letting him know that what he
[58:31] possesses is is greater than any
[58:35] fo in the book any any fo in the world
[58:40] now remember the open book amen was was
[58:44] given by the mighty Angel to the seventh
[58:46] angel the seventh angel the Bible says
[58:50] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[58:52] angel when he shall begin to sound amen
[58:56] the mystery of God should be finished
[58:58] and then we picked up at the scripture
[59:01] that says you go to that angel and pick
[59:05] up the open
[59:07] book and you eat it for you have to
[59:11] prophesy so it's going from the lamb the
[59:15] mighty angel coming down giving it to
[59:18] the do to the seventh angel the seventh
[59:20] Angel's voice declaring it the bride
[59:24] going to not just listening to it on
[59:26] amen but going to the angel that
[59:28] anointed brother brandham and says give
[59:31] me that Revelation
[59:36] too because there's going to be an enemy
[59:39] greater than anything that's ever came
[59:41] all of the forces of hell are are are
[59:44] are are congregating in this last age to
[59:46] stop this bride and just as what we we
[59:48] haven't seen anything that what Israel
[59:50] is fixing to have to face amen what
[59:52] they're fix the world is fixing to come
[59:53] against them but I can prophesy to you
[59:55] right now she will win and I want to say
[59:59] this bride is going to
[1:00:04] win and we're going to win right here on
[1:00:07] Satan's own
[1:00:09] turf if the prophet of God says that
[1:00:11] limbs are going to be spoken into
[1:00:13] existence I believe
[1:00:15] it if the prophet of God says the dead
[1:00:18] shall raise again amen I believe it if
[1:00:21] the prophet says those things oh Church
[1:00:24] let's get amen let's get that a right of
[1:00:26] unbelief kick clean out let's slay That
[1:00:28] Old
[1:00:30] Devil can you say
[1:00:32] amen amen sorry for all my coughing my
[1:00:35] word amen hallelujah we're gonna kill
[1:00:38] that thing too amen then he started
[1:00:41] towards me but he couldn't and I said
[1:00:43] Satan now watch The Voice watch the
[1:00:46] words Satan in the name of the Lord
[1:00:49] Jesus Christ I bind
[1:00:52] you and the serpent a blue smoke flew
[1:00:55] out of him and he curled up and made a a
[1:00:57] a a sign of an S capital S backwards
[1:01:00] amen capital S backwards and that means
[1:01:02] the and sign
[1:01:04] amen it means mind bind this one and
[1:01:08] anything below him because he was the
[1:01:10] worst the blue smoke fell out of him and
[1:01:13] his tail choked his own self to death
[1:01:15] around his head and when he made this
[1:01:17] backwards s the an sign like a
[1:01:20] conjunction amen he says it choked it to
[1:01:24] death and the brother was free it went
[1:01:26] over and mashed on it I went over and
[1:01:29] mashed on it and I said now i' I've got
[1:01:31] to find out about this because it's a
[1:01:33] vision and I hit on the thing and it
[1:01:36] turned like like that and and and it
[1:01:38] looked like looked like a handle on a on
[1:01:40] a glass handle on a picture and and and
[1:01:43] just made a solid Crystal and I said
[1:01:45] think of that how quick the blue smoke
[1:01:47] was life and and and everything that
[1:01:50] left it all the elements it's just
[1:01:52] turned to Glass and just then a voice
[1:01:55] came again and said you can unbind him
[1:01:59] also and so I said then Satan that I may
[1:02:03] know I unbind you and when it did he
[1:02:06] started coming to life again
[1:02:09] wiggling and I said I bind you back in
[1:02:11] the name of Jesus Christ and when it did
[1:02:13] the smoke flew out of him again he
[1:02:16] choked himself right back
[1:02:19] again and turn to Crystal and when he
[1:02:23] did that the voice says You must must be
[1:02:26] more sincere than what you are to do
[1:02:35] this you must be
[1:02:39] more
[1:02:41] sincere do you see why I'm why I've been
[1:02:43] hitting those these just these little
[1:02:45] areas in our lives
[1:02:47] lately I feel like I I feel like we've
[1:02:50] got the basics down I really do I feel
[1:02:53] like we've got I think our I I I I I I I
[1:02:56] know we all love God I know we're so on
[1:02:59] this message I believe
[1:03:01] that but I I I if if the prophet of God
[1:03:06] needed to be more
[1:03:07] sincere amen before the before the book
[1:03:10] would be
[1:03:12] revealed I I believe that it requires if
[1:03:15] the prophet
[1:03:17] hello if the prophet had to be more
[1:03:22] sincere I I don't I don't I I don't I I
[1:03:26] don't even want to put myself in the
[1:03:28] category of the spirituality of the
[1:03:32] Prophet Lord help me to be
[1:03:35] sincere help me to be more sincere not
[1:03:38] not not not just I'll tell you how
[1:03:41] sincere brother brandham was and this is
[1:03:44] before this Vision brother brandham was
[1:03:46] telling a story you know telling a joke
[1:03:49] to to to to some of the brothers and uh
[1:03:52] oh they laughed and they thought it was
[1:03:53] pretty good one been one went back home
[1:03:57] and uh told his wife the joke and said
[1:03:59] brother bradam told us this joke and and
[1:04:02] and and it hurt the woman so bad y'all
[1:04:04] remember that and she said I can't
[1:04:06] believe that brother Brandon being a
[1:04:08] prophet would joke like that and and it
[1:04:11] was a clean joke it was a good I mean it
[1:04:13] was it was a funny joke but and do you
[1:04:15] know what brother brandom did he got up
[1:04:17] behind the pull pit and said see I I I I
[1:04:21] wasn't being careful enough and I hurt
[1:04:23] Lord help me and and he and he he and he
[1:04:26] repents before the
[1:04:28] people for joke there's nothing wrong
[1:04:31] with telling a
[1:04:33] joke Hallelujah I I would have said you
[1:04:36] need to get some thicker skin young lady
[1:04:37] and and you know right but no that's not
[1:04:40] the way it
[1:04:43] was the
[1:04:45] sincerity i i i i and if and if that and
[1:04:48] if that was that way toward that woman
[1:04:50] how much more towards us towards one
[1:04:52] another sincerity of not hurting one
[1:04:56] another amen and then the sincerity of
[1:04:58] not hurting God can you say
[1:05:02] Amen
[1:05:03] now and and and he says you you he says
[1:05:07] he he says now you you must be more
[1:05:10] sincere than what you are to do this
[1:05:13] then it left me and I was standing in
[1:05:14] the room and a few minutes I heard a
[1:05:16] clock go off and my wife was my wife got
[1:05:18] up and getting up and the children you
[1:05:20] you know how it is I guess at your house
[1:05:23] uh uh well you know one them ones what
[1:05:25] am I going to wear today mama and where
[1:05:27] are my books and what did I did I do and
[1:05:29] you know how how just like any home you
[1:05:32] can't hardly hear yourself think hardly
[1:05:34] for all of them trying to get ready at
[1:05:36] once well brother brandham had a real
[1:05:37] life just like you other ladies Amen
[1:05:40] brother brandham sister me so I slipped
[1:05:42] off into the den room and I got down on
[1:05:44] my knees and I said Lord Jesus I don't
[1:05:46] know these things what must I do and and
[1:05:50] the children will be calling me to take
[1:05:52] them to school in a few minutes what
[1:05:53] must I do and I looked around my Bible
[1:05:55] was laying there and I said Lord if you
[1:05:57] forgive me I I I don't I don't believe
[1:06:00] in just opening up the scripture and and
[1:06:01] taking something out of the Bible and
[1:06:03] saying that but there there's times when
[1:06:06] God can comfort you by such a thing and
[1:06:08] I said Lord in in this case of emergency
[1:06:11] right now before your spirit leaves me I
[1:06:14] I don't know what to do the kids will be
[1:06:17] uh be an hour yet before they're gone
[1:06:19] what would you what would you uh show me
[1:06:22] and and if that was something that
[1:06:24] you're trying to get to me heaven father
[1:06:26] then let me know and I took the Bible
[1:06:29] and I just pulled it open like that and
[1:06:31] my thumb was laying on 1 Corinthians the
[1:06:34] the fifth chapter and the eth verse when
[1:06:37] something reads something like this when
[1:06:40] uh uh he says now I was planning on
[1:06:41] taking a a fast to the Lord and I told
[1:06:44] him I'd go out and fast and and but it
[1:06:47] says when you come to this Feast there
[1:06:49] in 1 Corinthians 5 and
[1:06:52] 8 when when you um uh
[1:06:57] uh when you come to this Feast which a
[1:06:58] feast in the body is a feast with the
[1:07:01] Lord we know that so or a fast in the
[1:07:03] body is a feast with the Lord we know
[1:07:06] that so when you come to this Feast
[1:07:09] don't come with the old leaven or the
[1:07:12] leaven of malice and so forth but come
[1:07:15] with the unleavened bread of
[1:07:19] sincerity and Truth just exactly what he
[1:07:23] had told me in the vision God is my
[1:07:26] solemn judge come with the unleavened
[1:07:30] bread of
[1:07:32] sincerity and
[1:07:34] Truth can you can can you say Amen now I
[1:07:39] I as as we think about this
[1:07:43] Lord Israel did not possess all of the
[1:07:50] land the mighty Angel was with them the
[1:07:53] prophet of God says the same angel that
[1:07:55] that Pillar of Fire that Pillar of Fire
[1:07:58] that was with brother brandom he says
[1:07:59] that was the same Angel the exact same
[1:08:04] angel that led the children of Israel to
[1:08:06] their promised
[1:08:08] land that Pillar of Fire that is over
[1:08:12] William bram's Head was the angel that
[1:08:14] told him I will
[1:08:16] destroy your
[1:08:20] enemies amen that's quite a study I I
[1:08:24] don't I'm not going to read all of those
[1:08:25] words
[1:08:26] where where the different ones said
[1:08:27] listen it's too hard to take can we have
[1:08:29] another land and and and God tells him
[1:08:32] get out there and possess the land that
[1:08:35] I've given you they were complaining
[1:08:38] well you've given them this and and we
[1:08:39] want the hill you've given us the Hill
[1:08:41] Country he says make make use of it it's
[1:08:45] your
[1:08:47] land and and and and you
[1:08:53] know we we might not own our own
[1:08:55] property here in in in in this
[1:08:58] life we we might
[1:09:00] be uh uh you know a renting or and and
[1:09:05] if we do own own something it's not much
[1:09:08] to count
[1:09:10] for but God has given us something that
[1:09:14] that is the greatest of all
[1:09:17] possession the Bible says the meek shall
[1:09:19] inherit the earth and we will inherit
[1:09:21] the earth so we're not trying to conquer
[1:09:23] this Earth that we have no we no land
[1:09:25] that we're trying that we're looking for
[1:09:27] God's promised us nothing here in this
[1:09:29] last age concerning
[1:09:32] that but what he has
[1:09:35] promised is I'm going to give you the
[1:09:38] title
[1:09:39] deed and you're going to find that all
[1:09:43] of me all everything that all of the
[1:09:46] Redemptive blessings healings all
[1:09:51] everything that you have need of in this
[1:09:53] life Journey from the cradle to the
[1:09:55] Rapture is right here and you can have
[1:10:00] it but it's going to require
[1:10:03] sincerity to follow after the
[1:10:07] Lord what is
[1:10:09] leaven we we know that the scripture
[1:10:12] says a little bit of leban
[1:10:16] Levan affects the whole
[1:10:19] lump amen is that isn't that what
[1:10:22] Galatians says he says you're gloring
[1:10:24] you you're you're you're your glorying
[1:10:26] is not good he's telling the glacia the
[1:10:28] church there at at glacia he says you
[1:10:31] you ran well but but but what is what
[1:10:34] what has hinder you that you obey not
[1:10:36] the truth now you're not you're know
[1:10:39] you're and it is it's it's there in
[1:10:41] Galatians where he says you started it
[1:10:44] but now you're you're sidetracked and
[1:10:46] everything else amen and and and he says
[1:10:50] listen he says a little bit of
[1:10:53] Leaven it it it Rens the whole
[1:10:59] Lum I
[1:11:02] I in in my thoughts of
[1:11:06] Overcomer I I think we we want to go
[1:11:10] through do do you do you remember what
[1:11:13] they used to have to do and they were to
[1:11:15] do this every
[1:11:16] Passover every time they were they done
[1:11:18] this as a tradition for years and years
[1:11:21] they were to God instructed them amen
[1:11:24] that at Passover that they were to take
[1:11:27] a
[1:11:28] candle and they would search throughout
[1:11:31] the entire house looking for leaven and
[1:11:36] they were to clean they were to search
[1:11:38] and clean out the entire house amen
[1:11:42] before Passover because they were fixed
[1:11:45] it was they had to have the leevan
[1:11:49] totally gone and they were required God
[1:11:52] told him take a lamp take a candle and
[1:11:55] make
[1:11:58] sure and and and and if we are going to
[1:12:01] get the L out of our Lives it's going to
[1:12:06] require real deep
[1:12:09] sincerity within
[1:12:12] us and I mean go through every Crook and
[1:12:15] cranny of our
[1:12:16] mind and if there's something that is
[1:12:18] that is leav that is ABS that is not
[1:12:20] God's word that is leading to
[1:12:23] unbelief then I think we need to
[1:12:25] pull away from
[1:12:28] it and get desire back where it belongs
[1:12:31] as I was saying last week get desire
[1:12:34] back where we need
[1:12:37] it I don't care what God's done for you
[1:12:39] yesterday and what God's done for me
[1:12:41] yesterday that are wonderful things but
[1:12:44] this is a new
[1:12:45] day I don't care that God brought you
[1:12:47] out of Egypt and God performed the
[1:12:48] Miracles and God brought you across the
[1:12:50] Red Sea and you are in your land this is
[1:12:52] a new day
[1:12:57] and if we are looking at the enemies on
[1:13:00] our
[1:13:01] land and choosing to get along with that
[1:13:04] enemy instead of defeating
[1:13:09] it we need to take the candle back to
[1:13:11] our heart and search for the leaven of
[1:13:16] unbelief God can only work in this bride
[1:13:20] in this last day when there is when you
[1:13:24] are feasting in with him with that
[1:13:26] unleavened bread of
[1:13:29] sincerity and
[1:13:32] Truth
[1:13:34] amen let it
[1:13:37] be let it be
[1:13:40] tonight oh God I'm going to get my I'm
[1:13:44] going to get my lamp out what what was
[1:13:46] the last what was the what was the thing
[1:13:49] when when when the bridegroom's voice
[1:13:51] came when The Voice or when the when the
[1:13:53] voice came behold
[1:13:56] the bridegroom
[1:13:58] cometh all of the lamps there was no
[1:14:04] lamps all the lamps had went
[1:14:07] out amen or or or or were going out
[1:14:11] because the Bible says that they had to
[1:14:12] trim their lamps but there was only a
[1:14:14] few that had the oil and the other few
[1:14:17] did not the foolish did not have oil the
[1:14:20] bride only had enough oil for
[1:14:23] themselves amen what does that oil
[1:14:26] represent the Holy Ghost so it takes the
[1:14:30] Holy Ghost the fire the flame of God to
[1:14:34] go through and say search me
[1:14:40] Lord in our morning times let's get
[1:14:42] serious about our
[1:14:44] prayer God's calling us to the
[1:14:50] feast the evening time is here this is
[1:14:53] the time of atonement
[1:14:55] the lamb has come and been made visible
[1:14:57] to us like none other before this is the
[1:14:59] Midnight Hour this is the Midnight
[1:15:07] Hour you're the elect you're the co out
[1:15:12] let's be deeply
[1:15:14] sincere with this that God's given
[1:15:18] us

[1:15:23] hallelujah we're going home
[1:15:26] don't go it this is not a fairy

[1:15:39] up that I'm needing to do I've got a lot
[1:15:41] of Leaven in this old in this old mind
[1:15:43] and heart of mine I I I I I want it

[1:15:54] saying God give it to to
[1:15:55] me give me that sincerity renew it back
[1:15:59] to me again I I I'm going to go on that
[1:16:03] feast and sometimes a fast as brother as
[1:16:06] brother brandham said a fast of the body
[1:16:08] is is a feast to the Lord coming in and
[1:16:12] being sincere before him and asking him
[1:16:15] for his
[1:16:17] grace

[1:17:08] sealed he says mark
[1:17:11] them put a seal on them who cry and sigh
[1:17:16] for the sins that are done in the
[1:17:20] cities he says if your heart is not out
[1:17:23] for Souls
