Lord help me to walk that way every day of my life and I'm trusting your grace for it Lord we thank you for it Lord we ask you to come in this service and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor for doing it we ask it in Jesus name amen amen Hallelujah isn't he good to us amen let's go to Matthew chapter 27 verse 32 and then we'll also read Luke 23:26 I felt to preach this tonight i' I've preached it before you may have heard it before but I trust it'll be a blessing to you I I uh just have to do what we feel led just have to be myself and I can't be anybody else so but I appreciate you having us here and I know you're your pastor brother Wendell having us it's intimidating to preach in wle Martin's Pulpit because of the the the the uh standard that he has held in Ministry and he can sing and preach and I can't so but uh we do what we can and we want to be a help wherever we're at we want to pick up our cross and carry it what I want to talk to you tonight compelled to carry the cross and I just want us to think about it won't keep you long tonight the Lord willing Matthew 27:32 and as they came out they found a man of sirene Simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross Luke 23:26 tells the same story as they led him away they laid hold upon one Simon a sirenian coming out of the country on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated at the time that Simon was compelled to carry the Cross of Christ he' been Jesus had been through uh six separate trials right lasting more than 24 hours that he had been from the time he'd been with his disciples and then he'd went through the hours of Agony in the garden he'd been taken beaten and he humiliated to prison and and I love this about Jesus that as he was examined by them none of them found a reason that they could accuse him righteously I'll be honest with you brother Josh if they put me through six separate trials they'd find something they'd say he didn't do this or he didn't do that or he he was not diligent enough and whatever they'd find something to accuse me of and they could righteously accuse me but they could not find a thing against the Lamb of God I'm so glad we have a spotless lamb tonight I'm so glad we can trust him I'm so glad we can put our faith and our confidence in the one that came and took our sins we don't have to carry them anymore he carried them for us and he was that spotless lamb that was examined and he was held up before him and even pilate had to say I find no fault in him oh I wonder if we can say that tonight I find no fault in him I'm looking at the word I look at the message of the hour and and I can't find any fault in it I see the bloody lamb and I know that there's no fault in it at all it's just him he's the one that died for me he's the one to save me and the word has no fault in it at all amen I find no fault in him and if I find no fault in him I find no fault in you either because you're the purchase of his blood oh don't you believe that tonight amen he they could not accuse him righteously you know what he was he was a suffering servant a suffering servant you find the concept of a suffering servant in the book of Isaiah I didn't I didn't give them all the scriptures tonight and I even don't have this on my notes but I've thought about this a lot lately that God there's an attribute of God that's a suffering servant and and I believe your pastor uh is acquainted with that I believe that's something that he does you know you don't always you know it's not always for popularity but you you suffer many times as you serve God and if you serve God for long you know that and yet you yet you must do it you're compelled to do it there's something inside of you that that calls you to it it's servanthood but it's what God wants you to do and so you're willing to do it but you suffer many times in doing that and and so in Isaiah 42 he talks about if you give me Isaiah 42:1 he talks about a suffering servant he said behold my servant whom I uphold my elect in whom my soul delighted all right I put my spirit upon on him now when we look at having the spirit of God upon upon us we would think we would think that that would mean that we were uh we we were jumping and shouting and running and that's wonderful when we do but that's not the his Spirit as it was displayed in the suffering servant was actually one who would not bear witness to himself amen so the next verse says he shall not cry nor lift up his his voice in the streets Oh my he he will not cause his voice to be heard in the street he will not cry and he will not cause his voice to be heard in the street and and verse three Isaiah 42:3 a bruised re shall he not break and what that verse two means is is that he will not be a self-promoter I wonder if we've got that kind of spirit on us that would not be a self-promoter I'll do whatever you call me to do Lord I'll I'll fill the place that you've given me to fill I'm not going to I'm not going to toot my own horn I'm not going to go out and try to find something to do but I'm going to do whatever needs to be done in the place where I'm at today that's right everybody's looking to serve God I say serve God in the place where you are in the condition where you are it may be just vacuuming the church it might be picking up some dishes whatever it is and I thank God for those men who have a revelation those ladies who have a revelation that serving God is serving his people we need more suffering servants and and let's uh start them around us very true amen yes he was a suffering servant said a bruised readed shall he not break I love that what that means is if you're already bruised he won't break you if you're already bruised he's not going to kick you down he's not going to cause more harm to you but he's actually going to help you brother B says if you're if you're if you struggle and things like that I'm paraphrasing but he uses that scripture a bruised read he won't break if you had trouble in your life he won't break you he wants to miss you he wants to heal you bruised breed that's his purpose a bruised breed rather he he will not break the smoking flx shall he not Quin he qu sh he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged shall he set judgment in the earth and the a shall wait for his law oh what a wonderful promise that the suffering servant has you can find more on the suffering servant in in Isaiah 52 at the very end there at verse 13 you can read down into Isaiah 53 and find that he was one who was despised and rejected of Men Who Bore our grease and carried our sorrows yet we did a steem him strick and smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for my transgression he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by his stripes I am healed oh do we believe that tonight amen bless the Lord he is the suffering servant bless the Lord in Mark 146 5 it says some begin to spit on him to cover his face and to Buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants oh you don't know how that makes me feel tonight the slaves struck him with the palm of their hands he was a suffering servant Psalms 1293 the plowers plowed upon my back they made long their furrows Isaiah 50 and6 I gave my back to the smiters my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair I hid not my face from shame and spitting in John 19:1 the Bible says that pilate took Jesus and scourged him Scourge is the word scourged isn't very descriptive but they took a cat of Ninetails they took a whip and what it would do they would put glass or little rocks in the end of it and they would actually hit you when they hit you it would wrap around your body and as it as they pulled it it would pull chunks of flesh out of your back oh my they said the Bible says in Isaiah when he's describing the suffering servant he describes him as being so marred that you couldn't even recognize who he was the soldiers platted a PL a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robe and said hail King of the Jews and they smote him with their hands in verse four four pilate therefore went forth again and said unto them behold I bring him forth to you that you may know I find no fault in him brother Bram talks about that time when he goes back to Jerusalem and he gives us a little drama of it he said 1900 years ago was a strange odd morning he said there was never a morning like that morning the sun came up but it looked like it was very strange something was going on he said about 9:00 we're standing in a room I hear a mob screaming someone says away with him I see a little woman run out in front of the mob and say what has he done he's only healed your sick and brought hopes to the Hopeless what has he done to deserve this who's she talking about out yeah he said I look behind I hear something going bump you've heard this many times but just think about it now in this context bump bump bump he said here's an old cross coming dragging down the street blood just dragging out the cross is dragging his bloody Footprints out coming down the street spit hanging over his face he carried his cross after he'd been beaten after he'd been up all night after he had been through the struggle after they falsely accused him after he'd given everything he had in the Garden of Gethsemane after after he prayed all night that's when he did the work that God required him to do the devil walking around saying enough he was the son of God he never put up with something like that he does the same thing today he walks around and accuses and says if you were a real Christian you wouldn't be going through that he went through it it's becoming to me to suffer in my life at times when need be I believe that there's joy as a Christian and and there's peace as a Christian all those things but there's times when it's becoming to me as a Christian to suffer for him and I said let it be so he suffered for me all right he goes up the hill brother brand said I noticed he's got a white garment on but there's little red spots all over that white garment and they get bigger and larger as he goes he's losing blood with his blood he's losing strength yeah you ever known somebody that needed a blood transfusion they don't know why they're really weak they need a blood transfusion they need more blood they're just they're losing blood somewhere they need more blood he's losing blood as he walks up the hill he didn't make it easy on him to take it he said here's this after a while just one great big bloody Splash smacking up against his legs going to Calvary you get the picture of one who's who's done all that he can do humanly speaking and we know he went to Calvary as a man he didn't go as an angel he didn't go even as God he went as a man he could have went in a different way he could have he could have done it but he had to do what his father called him to do so he goes as a man and when he does in in his Humanity he gets weak yeah God doesn't get weak but the body got weak I want you to understand it tonight God doesn't get weak but his body does and so he he God was not weak but but the body of Christ that God had dwelt him he was going up the hill and he falls and I want you to understand when he fell that heaven was quiet can you imagine come on you kids I hope you can see it tonight can you imagine he falls if he can't go on up the hill All Is Lost see he has to fulfill what's written about him in the scripture so he has to be able to get up and carry his cross but he's physically unable to do it now I can imagine the angels caught their breath yeah for a moment for a brief moment the work of redemption was suspended all right yeah come on but Before Time began God had a way a plan for this moment I want to tell you tonight when the body of Christ gets weak Before Time began God had a plan to get you through he had a plan to pick you up he had a plan that there would be somebody there to help [Applause] youall Bless The Name of Jesus and the Roman soldier not even knowing the part he was playing as they come to a Crossroads and here stands people at the crossroads and there's one there in African man named Simon of sirene from Northern Africa he sees that African man standing in the crowd and he says you you carry his cross if you had asked Simon who called him he would have said a Roman soldier all right if you'd asked Simon why he did what he did he' have said I just did what I had to do I did what I was compelled to do and it's it's interesting to note at that time that who was not there when Jesus got weak Peter wasn't there come on he had denied him all right James and John weren't there they weren't called upon no men of great reputation I I don't want you to saell yourself short tonight God's got something for you to do he's got something for me to do yeah huj the men of great reputation weren't standing there he said well we're we're a small group and we're we're in Pony Oklahoma and and we're just a a bunch of hillbillies or rednecks that's what we are in Arkansas anyway you said that's just who we are but I'll say this God's got something for you to do and I'm so thankful that when I get weak that the body of Christ in Pony Oklahoma can pick up the slack and when you get weak I hope the body of Christ in in Hardy Arkansas can pick up the slack on Carry the Cross bless the Lord he was a seemingly random bystander of A different race the black man from sirene near Libya the Bible tells us he was coming out of the country he didn't live in Jerusalem perhaps he was going to offer a lamb for a sacrifice maybe on some other business and he just happened to be standing there caught by circumstance in the very place where Jesus would need him to be I want to ask you tonight why wouldn't God just send Supernatural strength yeah on to Jesus to carry the cross yeah why not have Angels pick it up and carry it Jesus has done enough you would think at that moment why not just have Angels carry it but that's not how God works brother Brown said he uses men how many believe that tonight he does nothing outside of what he does by men he said we realize that that's his agent that's what he chose he said why I don't know that's pretty good is it that's he said why I don't know but he does it amen why I don't know he said he could have made the son to preach the gospel he could make the wind to preach the gospel he can make the wind to do things but he chose men that was his idea that human being would speak back through human not himself but the word of the Lord came to the prophets the prophesy the preachers he said in a prophet s that denies the original word how can he be a true prophet he can't be because he's denying the truth of the word but he uses men he uses men only he uses the agency of men and not Mechanical Devices he hides himself behind skin and uses the space created by the weakness of Man by by by the by the struggles that we have he actually uses the space created by weakness to make himself strong amen and and he fulfills his word Through People Like Us okay all right are you still with me tonight oh yeah oh yeah without someone there to carry the cross of scripture could not be fulfilled and I and I'll say it like this and just don't know how to more bluntly to put it without you doing your job in the church the scripture couldn't be fulfilled there's a scripture written for our day it'll be a glorious Church Without spot a wrinkle a bride to put her wedding garments on and you say well my job's not very important but without you doing what you do the scripture could not be fulfilled it's part of it and so in Psalms 224 there was a scripture said I'm poured out like water my bones d a joint my heart is like Wax it's melted in the midst of my bows my strength is dried up like a pot shirt my tongue cleaveth to my jaws thou Hast brought me into the dust of death dogs have encompassed me the Assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet he said I may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me they part my garment among them cast thought upon my vesture this the scripture David speaking under prophecy he's speaking of the crucifixion Jesus cannot die on the way to the to Calvary he's got to go through with it how's he going to go through with it with the help of Simon without Simon oh God I hope you recognize your part in the message of the hour you say well I'm not a prophet I'm not a preacher but you have a part in the message of the hour without Simon picking up his cross there would be no crucifix without you picking up your cross and carrying it in the house of God there would be no good server there would be no meetings there would be no no lost loved ones come in there would be no healing why because you didn't do it but I believe you've taken up your cross and you do it and because of that you fulfilled the word of God for your day because of that the words of God could be fulfilled brother brandom talked about how many outstanding prophecies was fulfilled he said you said this has to happen and that has to happen but he said if you look at the 20 22d Psalm watch his dying hour at the cross he said many outstanding prophecies was fulfilled in the last two or three hours of his life as he hung on a cross that Simon carried come on he could have called 10,000 angels but he chose Simon the scripture says Simon was compelled that's always struck me he was compelled compelled by a Roman soldier but I believe predestined by God to be in that moment because we know nothing happens by chance he was compelled to be at that crossroads at that time to to be at that stoplight as we would say today at the right time that when the body of Christ grew weak he was there to pick up the cross and I'm I just want this to be my testimony church and I preach this all over the world but I want this to be my testimony I pray it be the testimony of this church and our church and Hardy and others around the message uh we don't want great fortune or fame I I don't want my name to be known all over the world just let me be there that when the body if the body of Christ is weak let me be there to pick it up let me be there to be one somebody's got to take the hard jobs somebody's got to do what others won't be with willing to do somebody's got to do the thing that needs to be done let it be me would that be your prayer tonight let it be me I won't be a complainer I won't be a rejector I won't be a a burden on the people of the pastor of the church I'm going to be one who carries my cross with all that I've got in me I'm going to I'm going to live for this message I'm going to believe this message you're not here by chance Simon wasn't there by chance you are not here tonight in this building by chance you are not given the gifts that you have by chance you've been compelled to carry the cross you were not born into your family by chance but in God's Great drama you play a part you see some had to be the high priest that lied on him some had to be the guards that smoted him some were disciples but some somebody had to carry his cross brother Bram says this he said in his army presents his army in the form of five officers Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his soldiers commanding officers with the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word of God He said Each one backing one another up I believe that's what we ought to do I believe if I come to the house of God and I preach from the window he preaches we ought to back one another up as long as we stay with the word let's back each other up He said Each one backing one another up with him the chief Captain not out there in front up here above back behind but in them he said that's the Army vindicating his resurrection by the proof of his Works he said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also what is it it's God in the church and these five predestinated officers backing up every word that he said with the Holy Spirit himself in there which is the word made manifest proving his resurrection proving that he lives you believe he lives tonight he proved that he lives listen he compels us if you're a preacher today I want to challenge you by this he compels you to car you can't stop preaching because when you stop it just burns within you I've tried to do it you try to stop for a while and you just can't do it why there's something inside of you you may not be the best preacher in the world you may not I understand that I I'm I I realize that I'm not the one that can be the best preacher out there but I also know this I may not be the best speaker but I'm needed somewhere not everybody has to hear my Ministry but somebody does or God wouldn't have given me this ministry that's right he compels me to fulfill his word now brother Brandon said Jesus Corporal body is sitting at the right hand of God in the Majesty on high as a sin offering and then his spirit that was in that body has come back into predestined for ordained offices in the church he said that this is powerful he he said you touch God the same way through these bodies that's not in their own self not worthy sure not but they don't stand in their own righteousness they stand in the robe of the Lord Jesus in his righteousness to declare his Works see we we've but we've each been called to car cross not just prophets and preachers Luke 9:23 he said to them all he said to them all if any man someone say it with me any man man any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me Paul put it this way in Galatians he said I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I'm crucified with Christ oh carry my cross I've been compelled I wasn't compelled because I chose to I wasn't compelled I didn't put myself in the ministry I didn't promote myself but I was standing there when the body of Christ had a need and I just stepped up and took up my cross what what about any other job not just preaching but anything you do for God you said brother Ben I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing the Lord hasn't revealed to me do what needs to be done do what do what you can do that needs to be done and you'll fulfill the word of God you'll move the power of God forward there are things you can can do if you're a woman you won't be called to be a preacher but you might be called to do something else in the body that's just as important for that particular service as the preacher that preach his sermon you might be called to get down on your knees and pray and call out to God for this service you might be called to to sing or to worship or do whatever it is that you do you might have been called just to be there so someone could see you there and be encouraged I'm compelled to carry the cross I don't know this is different but if you ever felt like that I'm compelled now each one of you each per each person's cross is different because each one has a different purpose well the brandom says this this is an interesting way of looking at it especially after the banquet last night brother Brown said don't turn your wife down because she's got a little temper he said maybe that's your cross wo it got quiet I married a thank God I married a girl with almost no temper like she just almost no temper she it's possible for me to make her mad but make her angry but it's very rare and I'm so thankful for that because there was a lot of people that wouldn't have worked with but I'm so glad God gave me the right one aren't you glad of that but he said maybe that's your cross people think well I meant this is difficult I need to get out of it that's not what we do maybe that's your cross he said God might have give it to you to kind of keep you lined up he said same thing with you women do your husband stick together you promis God you would so stay with it a preacher's wife has a cross to bear and many times it's her husband's Ministry you think of Moses and zephra and what brother brother R talked about this and he said what that's what a what a mixup the people has got in today I think that Christianity is one of the softest things said all they do is put their name on a book and have somebody to sprinkle them or something another and give the minister the right hand of Fellowship that's all there is to it he said going out he said that's not Christianity Christianity is self-denial amen no matter who you are preacher Preachers Wife Deacon just a person in the church Christianity is self-denial take up your cross daily and follow him see to take up your cross and to take up your cross I know there's nothing new but listen to me for just a minute to take up your cross is to humble yourself to the vision that God has for your life and it may not match what you wanted to do I remember wanting to be a mechanic at some point in my life and I have no gift at all for working on cars but I had decided that I was going to be a mechanic because I did not want to become my father my father was a preacher and I just did not want to do that and so I I decided I was going to be a mechanic and that's the problem I I can't even I I can't even change my own oil and and so I pay somebody else to do that so I found that that was not I was not gifted with that and and you've been gifted with certain things but it may not be what you had in your mind but you got to humble yourself to the vision of God to what we talked about this morning the thoughts that God had of you for your own life the Rich Young Ruler was UN unwilling to do that in mark 10:21 it says Jesus beholding him loved him and said one thing you lack go your way sell whatever you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and it said he was sad at that saying and went away grief for he had great possessions the message of the hour did not match the vision he had for his life and so he could would not carry the cross and because he would not carry the cross he could not receive the reward but I'm so glad there's some people here today that Carri the cross like Moses did he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter but he took upon himself the form of a servant and oh my just like Jesus did in a type he took on himself the form of a servant and become a mud dber for the people of God I believe there's some people here willing to take up their cross and follow him the Rich Young Ruler was not willing to do what it takes to be saved until it was too late and then he tried to get them to go back and raise the dead so people would believe but it was too late we got to carry the cross now today at the moment the opportunity is given when we meet the body of Christ when we meet together and we see some part that's weak when we see some part that's burdened when we see some part of it that needs something from God let me be the one that offers the prayer let me be the one that cries out to God Amen me do what needs to be done yes that's why sometimes you see preachers taking out the trash or helping in some way because it just needs to be done right and I just call attention to that because you all do that wonderfully and I'm so glad for the ministry God has put here but all of us just do what needs to be done wouldn't it go a lot better if we just work like that he said but but it won't be easy no it won't be easy of course not it's a cross but you got to have a lamb nature that's why he could be the the servant the suffering servant of God he was a lamb the Bible says he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth oh God help me today I want to speak out in my defense so often but God help me as a pastor to to to take the nature of Christ in my own in my own Ministry in my own personal life let me be as one who has brought as a lamb to the solder as a sheep before his shears is done so he opened not his mouth a lamb is born without the ability to take care of himself even to survive without help his nature is to be led he learns to follow his master's voice all he has is wo it's all he has and he gives it up willingly he can't make it come and he don't stop it from going amen he just Bears wall and someone comes and shears him and he has no complaint because he has complete trust in the shepherd bless the lordu I believe that Simon the sirene was a lamb he he may have been doing other things but when he was compelled to carry the cross he just followed what what God had compelled him to do even though it was through the hands of a Roman soldier so he was compelled to do this to do what needed to be done he proved who he was by being obedient to God's will so that the work of God could go on so the words of God could be fulfilled he he might have you know it might have been a Wonder to him you know as he stood there and he's standing at that crossroads he just happened to be there at the right place at the right time and and he might have stood there and he might have said well this is not what I had planned I was going to do some business I was going down to make some money I wonder how many of us have stood at that same Crossroads and said you know I had plans for my life but God interrupted those plans and called me to a life of service out of my own desires and called me to his Simon is carrying that cross he might have thought I didn't I didn't wake up this morning and think that I'd have blood running all over me where his Blood Stained The Old Rugged Cross I didn't wake up this morning and think that I would be following oh God one a lamb who was going to the cross I didn't wake up this morning and think that I would be the one that would have to do it but this is my opportunity to do something for him oh I wonder tonight if we have an opportunity to do something for him even if it's just raising our hands in church even if it's saying Amen to the preacher let me be one who who takes my opportunity Hallelujah don't leave it for somebody else it's me that was at the crossroads it's me that felt the power of God it's me that let him work in my life Hallelujah this may not be what I intended to do with my life but this is what was needed and this is what I'll do not my will but thine be done what happened to Simon that intersection of his way and God's way changed the trajectory of Simon's life are you waking up to listen for just a few more minutes I know it's Sunday night but listen we're all I believe we're Christians here tonight you want to hear the word of God the Bible says they compelled Mark 15:21 if you can pull that up they compel one Simon a sirenian who passed by like he just happened to be there like you think you just happened to be born in Pony here in this church or into your family you just happened to be there and they're all preachers so you were one anyway but God did that for a reason are you with me now you were born there for a reason they compelled who one who passed by coming out of the country listen now what it says it's very interesting he said the father of Alexander and Rufus to bear his cross and Alexander and Rufus I guess were like a were like Kobe and and Josh and and Caleb Martin you know they were so well known around the message of the hour that Paul didn't or or Mark rather didn't have to explain who they were right think about it for a minute he said they was the father of Alexander and Rufus and and they compelled Simon to carry his cross and by in in explanation of who Simon was he said he was the father of Alexander and Rufus they're so well known to the Christian Church Mark doesn't have to explain who they are you find Rufus again in Romans 16:13 and we believe it's the same one historians believe the same one say salute Rufus chosen in the Lord and his mother and mine I'm going to challenge you tonight you want to change your story of your family you want to change you want to break generational curses you you want to make a difference in your family and the way things have been pick up your cross it'll make a difference to your children it'll make a difference to your grandchildren be willing to do the work of the Lord and it'll make a difference in your life because men like brother durren who was here this morning when men like that took up their cross be bore their cross because he bore his cross it makes it that much easier for the next generation and the Next Generation and the people of God may not know his name but they know their names he changed his family history now let me tell you how radically he changed his family history 2,000 years later oh God oh God a prophet was praying for a blind girl in Jonesboro Arkansas near where we live he's praying for a blind girl she had you remember the story how she had lost her way and she told him if I can get to the Healer she said I'll find my own Daddy and and he saidwell I'm brother brandom and he began to talk to her and when he got down to pray for her he said something interesting which he said often if you go look it up on the tape he said Lord said this is one of Simon's children and basically brother brandham over and over again when he met when he prayed for an African person he'd pray for them or an African-American person he would pray for them and say this is one of Simon's children amen he was reminding God and he would do that he'd say Lord you remember what Simon did for you 2,000 years later Simon's family was still receiving the benefits and a little blind girl's eyes came open because Simon picked up his cross and a prophet grabs a hold of inspiration and says Simon picked up his cross would you heal her eyes you think it don't make a difference what you do in the church you think it don't make a difference how when you come and pray you think it don't make a difference whether you're there on Sunday night or not because you picked up your cross today if the Lord carries many years down the road there will be something that'll come out of thatl something good you want to break your family curse you want to get out of that that rut pick up your cross you never sorry a little bit of a baby I went to Africa twice once about six years ago I think and once this spring or last spring Easter when I was there before the very first thing I ever did in Africa they we arrived on Saturday night and on Sunday morning I went to preach in a church by myself and they took me to a pastor Bene there in L Togo and and I was there in his church and I preached this message in that church and I'll never forget that because at the beginning before I come to preach you know how they'll do they'll bring their babies to be dedicated and they brought up one baby to be dedicated and I dedicated and they brought up another one this baby had a cliff lip and I just for Kobe I just was hard for me to take because I knew I'd read up on Togo and I knew they didn't have any doctors hardly their their Hospital their one hospitals known as the morg and so it's a place where they just go to die and I knew this baby didn't have any Chan growing up to be normal and I thought for a brief moment what if I could take it home with me I don't have a way of doing it I don't have the money to care for it oh I wish I could do something for it and the only thing I could think to do because I was about to preach this sermon is I I thought Lord and I prayed out I said Lord this is one of Simon's children this is one of Simon's children well would you just take Simon's you remember what he did for you and I just prayed like brother brandham did because I knew he had prayed that way and and and and we give it back to the mother and I go back five years later and and it so struck my heart I've got a picture of myself with that baby with that Cliff lip baby it so struck my heart that I I went back five years later and I asked the pastor through an interpreter I said what you know what happened to that baby I'd like to know I was almost afraid to ask I said I'd like to know and when he was translated to him a big smile covered his face and he said they translated it back to me he said he's completely well hallah he's completely well I believe God still does that and I don't know what happened brother W in between time I don't know if he made it to a doctor I don't know if it supernaturally he was just completely healed at that moment but by the time five years later arrived he was completely implausibly without I thought any hope of getting better and he was better let me tell you tonight what was it God honoring his word because Simon picked up his cross 2,000 years ago God was still honoring that family don't you know God will honor your family as well don't be weary and wello don't give up because people don't look at you and say well there's something big but realize that God is doing something he's working in your life pick up your cross and there'll be lasting success not momentary Fame cu the cross doesn't look like success but it is and I feel like and I know that you do as well I feel like when Jesus said in Luke 17:10 he's instructing his disciples he says when you've done all those things which are commanded you heal the sick cast out Devils when you've done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do that's all I can do just let me do what you called me to do let me do I've been compelled to do it it but I'll do it with all of my heart you see I cannot do for him what he did for me David says that in the Psalms he says I can't repay all the goodness that he's given me he said but I'll pay my vows in the midst of the congregation and he says this he said I will take the cup and I preach that in communion services that that was it was a way we can't do anything to uh we cannot die for our own sins he already did that but we can take the cup we can Fellowship together we can worship together we can take communion we can do our part to carry the cross closing here in just a moment the Bible tells us if we suffer with him we shall also reign with him if we deny him he will deny us all of us have something to do brother brandham did what he was born to do brother brandham says this in the token he said just what I've seen in my own Ministry seen him done you couldn't pile the volumes on this platform here he said if I wrote it in details what I seen him just do in my own Ministry he said he had more success in my Ministry than he did in his own now look at his attitude he said no now remember he had more success now not me he had he said he had more success in Jeffersonville than he did in Nazareth in that Wicked City in this wicked City CU he could for could perform no Miracles there but he did here he finally broke through here he got it done here he might have had to get people somewhere else but he got it done anyhow he said he had more success right here than he did in capernium or Nazareth in that he said he done more miracles right here in this Tabernacle than he did in his entire Ministry on Earth he said that's right he did it now what about the rest of the world he said Oh my he said no that's what he done he said now remember he done now listen to the secret you want to know the secret to a prophet's Ministry listen to what he says he said remember he done he said now never said I done it cuz I didn't do it he said I just I just loved him I I just loved him and said what he said and the Holy Spirit went to the other people and they believed what he said and then he done the work what a great description of ministry what a great description of picking up your cross aren't you glad a prophet of God took up his cross and follow Jesus aren't you glad you can do the same thing he said I just loved him and submitted myself to him and the Holy Spirit went to the other people and they believe what he said and he done the work what did it take to get his life to that Point musicians go ahead and come if you will look at his attitude at the end of a life story you forgive me if you've heard me say this before but it just means so much to me brother brandham goes through and he talks about his wife that he lost and his baby and all those things and he just broke him up and he was tender-hearted we don't want to get bitter when we go through things get hard I want to stay tender brother Brown says he got to a place he can't preach no more he said I just can't do it anymore he said oh God have mercy I just think back across the streaks of tears and heartaches and troubles said oh Father and I'm ashamed of all of my life why didn't I know you before he said I've tried with all my heart dear Jesus to live for you wonder if we could say that tonight he said to do the thing and I just love the way he puts it he said I've tried to do the thing and he had his thing to do you have your thing to do but it's to do what you're called to do to do the thing he said no matter what this cross is or how scornful it seems to be and he says this he said I love you dear Jesus you've broken my heart over and over but I love you for it I want to stand here today I'm not trying to be a prophet or trying to be what he was but I can say in the short time that I've been alive that I've had my heart broken over and over again but I want to stand here and say with the prophet of God I love you for it I love you dear Jesus I wouldn't trade it for anything this is my life story when pick up my cross and follow him there was a woman brother Bram tells about with a drunk husband a husband who was a drunk and the husband went down to the bar and he was talking to his fellows and they said there is no real Christians they're all just a bunch of fakes he said but I know one they said prove it to us he said I will so they go down to his house and they come in act like they're all drunk and they go inside the house and they and they just make a big mess and the woman fix me something to eat and she makes him some eggs and he brings them in there and he takes them he throws them on the floor he said you know I don't want my eggs like that and she said okay dear I'll make you some more he said oh I don't want anymore he walked outside with his friends went out on the porch and the they're sitting there on the porch and she's trying to clean up after the mess he made when he threw his dish down on the floor and clean up the eggs and the dishes and she's sniffing like that she's trying not to cry brother B since she begin to sing the song must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me he said this consecrated cross I'll bear Till Death Shall Set Me Free and then go home my crown to wear for there is a crown for me he told his friends he said see there is a real Christian and those men gave their heart to the Lord song goes on to say oh precious cross oh glorious Crown oh Resurrection Day when Christ the Lord From Heaven comes down and bears my soul away you know when that song was written it was originally written differently than must Jesus bear the cross alone they the Publishers changed it but the original author wrote it like this must Simon bear the cross alone and other Saints be free each saint of thine shall find his own there is one for me would you bow your heads with me I know it's solemn and maybe a quiet moment I can't be everybody else I'm just who I am this is just who I am and I but I'll say this I I found great strength in moments of quietness when we just know that the presence of God is here there is a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me I don't know what that cross is today but will you will you pick it up you see the body of Christ as we whether you realize your your husband your wife they're a part of the body of Christ today this church our church back in Hardy the churches everywhere I'm so glad that other churches took an interest in other pastors have taken an interest in in my life and helped me and I want to thank them for doing that they didn't realize it but they were picking up their cross when the body of Christ was weak and it just didn't seem like he could go another day I don't know about you but sometimes serving God Mondays are hard and sometimes you feel like you just you just thought I've resigned so many times on Mondays and I know every Pastor has and you feel like you just can't go another way but every once another day but every once in a while I'll get a text from somebody or a note or a little kid will write something say pastor we love you just thinking about you today I want to tell you want to tell you that you're to keep keep pressing battle what did the Saints say to brother Brandon when he looked beyond the curtain of time they told him before left they said keep pressing on keep pressing on is what I want to say to you tonight keep pressing on but I wonder if you've had opportunity to to pick up the body of Christ when it was weak to help it along to do the work that maybe someone else was doing but to do it because you realize they just can't carry it anymore if you have that opportunity just take it just take it walk with Jesus be like Simon carry his cross you could I could never be Jesus but let me carry the cross let me carry the cross let me do my part and everything will be okay could you pray that way with me oh God help me to do my part to carry my cross Heavenly Father Lord this is my desire tonight I want to carry the cross Lord this consecrated cross I'll bear I want to do that I want to keep doing that let me not to lose sight of it Lord success sometimes blinds us from from who we really ought to be and I pray God that you would help us to be who you who you want us to be to carry our cross to be compelled by your spirit compelled by Your Word by the fire that's raging within us of the Holy Ghost to go out and do the thing whether that's picking up trash or helping Park cars or helping the pastor in some way so he can do other work or just being in the house of God Faithfully let me carry my cross Lord nobody said it would be easy but you did so much for me help me to do my part for you Lord may we be reminded I know there's nothing new tonight may we be reminded of it reminded by it Lord to do our work and believe that there's a reward at the end of the road we ask in Jesus name amen hallelujah let's just worship him a minute could we stand together just worship him a minute brother Coe If you could begin to sing something if you have a need I'd be glad to pray with you the window I'm sure
