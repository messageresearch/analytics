[49:20] after I called sister Britany Jennifer
[49:23] last night and
[49:26] uh but brother brother Ben and sister
[49:30] Jennifer sister
[49:31] Britney have been dear friends of ours
[49:34] for um for a very long
[49:38] time and I have I I I have uh I have
[49:43] known them for for many years and what
[49:46] what they are today is what they've
[49:49] always
[49:50] been they are
[49:53] servants they have heart for people
[49:56] people brother Ben is more than just a

[50:02] when you see brother Ben or sister
[50:05] Britney you you can feel the love in
[50:08] their heart and their genuine pastors
[50:12] and it's just an honor to have brother
[50:17] Ben put here with us to to minister to
[50:21] us today and I say let's let's just pull
[50:25] on the gift of God I have always been
[50:30] blessed uh through the ministry of
[50:32] brother Ben PR and so I I I count it a
[50:37] very high privilege uh to have him here
[50:41] this is going to be brother Ben's first
[50:43] time ministering in our new building and
[50:46] um uh so I I I I I tell you what we've
[50:51] never had a a a finer man behind this
[50:55] pull pit it in the in the 34 years of uh
[50:59] being here in pawy and so uh I just want
[51:03] to give him a a little Little Flower
[51:06] here and and let him know how much I
[51:09] appreciate him and let you know how much
[51:10] I appreciate him I appreciate this
[51:13] wonderful man of God let's stand to our
[51:14] feet amen get ready for the word of the
[51:17] Lord I I I I I don't I don't think it's
[51:20] wrong to to uh uh appreciate men of God
[51:26] they get enough criticism as it is
[51:28] that's right and U and so if I respect
[51:31] somebody I think I think sometimes it's
[51:33] good to let him know and so now he might
[51:36] have a hard time coming out and
[51:37] preaching after me bragging on him but
[51:39] amen uh but we appreciate him amen God

[55:20] faith to believe it Lord and we're
[55:22] trusting you for it and believing it in
[55:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[55:26] pray amen
[55:30] amen amen we love the Lord this morning
[55:34] isn't he good to
[55:36] us amen turn with me if you would to job
[55:40] Book of
[55:41] Job and we'll read uh chapter 29 we'll
[55:45] start in verse one I while you're
[55:47] turning there I want to say how much I
[55:49] appreciate brother Wendell I I I can't
[55:51] build a man up like brother Wendell can
[55:54] but but we sure do appreciate your
[55:56] pastor and and he's been such a blessing
[55:58] to us he's been an elder to me in many
[56:00] ways over the years and so we're
[56:03] thankful for him and and for the church
[56:05] here and uh I'm so glad to see you uh
[56:09] still fighting the battle after all of
[56:10] these years and my mind goes back to the
[56:13] old church and and uh when we were there
[56:16] and and how the Lord has blessed you so
[56:18] much and I just pray continue to bless
[56:20] you I know that he will we're in his
[56:22] hand today and that's enough he knows
[56:25] what we're going through and that's
[56:26] enough do you believe that today you
[56:28] really believe he knows what you're
[56:29] going through he knows about you he he
[56:31] can see everything and he knows every
[56:33] twist in the road going forward amen so
[56:36] we believe that today Job chapter 29 and
[56:39] verse one say moreover job continued in
[56:42] his Parable and said oh that I were as
[56:47] in months past as in the days when God
[56:52] preserved me when his candle shined upon
[56:55] my head when by his light I walked
[56:59] through Darkness as I was in the days of
[57:02] my youth when the secret of God was upon
[57:06] my Tabernacle when the almighty was yet
[57:09] with me when my children were about me
[57:13] when I washed my steps with butter and
[57:16] The Rock poured Me Out Rivers of oil
[57:19] then I want to go to the end of the
[57:21] Bible Jude chapter 3 or Jude verse three
[57:24] right before the Book of Revelation Jude
[57:27] verse3 it's a very common
[57:33] scripture says beloved when I gave all
[57:36] diligence to write unto you the common
[57:38] salvation it was needful for me to write
[57:41] unto you and exhort you that you should
[57:45] earnestly contend for the faith which
[57:48] was once delivered unto the Saints amen
[57:52] I pray the Lord would add a blessing to
[57:53] the word you may be seated this
[57:57] morning there's something alluring about
[58:00] the past there's something about
[58:02] yesterday that uh seems golden to us it
[58:05] seems like that it's a a time or a place
[58:09] that was better and I think we can all
[58:11] remember better days I I think no matter
[58:15] who we are how good things are right now
[58:17] you can look back and maybe through
[58:19] rose-colored glasses or perhaps looking
[58:22] at U things the way you wish they that
[58:24] they were instead of how they actually
[58:26] were but you remember things in days
[58:28] that were better and times that were uh
[58:31] more uh the way you wanted things and it
[58:33] seems like everything was in order and
[58:36] everything was appropriate and
[58:37] everything was going just like you
[58:39] wanted it to go and and yet we realize
[58:43] that the Bible tells us in Psalms
[58:45] 37:23 that the steps of a good man are
[58:49] ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in
[58:52] his way the steps of a good man and you
[58:55] say well brother Ben I'm not a very good
[58:57] man or I'm not a very good person but
[58:59] I'll I'll say this you've been made good
[59:01] by the blood of Jesus Christ he he has
[59:03] changed you he saved you and I trust
[59:06] that's the case with you today and so
[59:08] you can say my steps have been ordered
[59:10] of the Lord the the routes that I've
[59:12] taken the places I've been the things
[59:15] that I went through the struggles that I
[59:17] had everything about me it's been
[59:19] ordered by God how many can say Amen to
[59:22] that today God saw it before I could see
[59:25] it and he led me down that path the
[59:29] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[59:32] Lord and he delighteth in his way oh the
[59:35] Lord knows what you're going through
[59:37] what you're about to go through and he
[59:39] knows what's best for you the Bible
[59:41] tells us all things work together for
[59:44] the good to them that are called
[59:45] according to the purpose of God to God
[59:48] so we can't just look at what has been
[59:51] but look at today as a this has to be a
[59:53] better day because it's the day God has
[59:56] led us to it's the best that we can be
[59:59] for today now I want to title this this
[1:00:02] morning going back to our future going
[1:00:06] back to our future now brother brandom
[1:00:10] talks about going back he said now if we
[1:00:11] looked around tonight he said we' go
[1:00:14] back to some of these great churches all
[1:00:16] the way down through the age and say
[1:00:19] this is it or this is it he said if you
[1:00:21] don't watch we'll be walking in a glare
[1:00:24] in instead of a light so he says we're
[1:00:26] going back to something but if we're not
[1:00:28] careful all we're seeing is a glare
[1:00:31] we're we're getting a what we're seeing
[1:00:33] is a mirage we're not actually seeing or
[1:00:36] walking in the light he said we're
[1:00:37] looking at something that passed years
[1:00:40] past looking back and he types it to
[1:00:42] someone driving down the road looking in
[1:00:45] the rearview mirror if you look only in
[1:00:47] your rearview mirror you can't see
[1:00:49] what's out in front of you and you're
[1:00:50] not headed backwards you're headed
[1:00:52] forwards you in life you can't go back
[1:00:55] you've got to go
[1:00:57] forward you're going to get older
[1:00:59] whether you like it or
[1:01:00] not amen the time is going to progress
[1:01:03] whether we like it or not we're going to
[1:01:05] be but you know what we are we're one
[1:01:07] day closer to the Rapture we're one day
[1:01:09] closer to going home one day closer to
[1:01:11] being together where we can express
[1:01:13] ourselves The Way We Were Meant to
[1:01:15] express ourselves one day closer to
[1:01:17] worship
[1:01:19] together one day closer where we don't
[1:01:22] have to look only in the memory but
[1:01:24] people people get caught up in that and
[1:01:26] and I understand it because there
[1:01:27] there's something special about memory
[1:01:30] but brother brandham tells us he said
[1:01:31] look
[1:01:32] forward look where you're going to and I
[1:01:36] want to say this you know usually when
[1:01:38] when I preach a sermon out I I'll preach
[1:01:40] somewhere I'll preach something I've
[1:01:41] preached back at home but this morning
[1:01:43] the lord gave this to me this week and
[1:01:46] so I haven't had an opportunity to
[1:01:47] preach it and I I just thought about us
[1:01:49] as a as a group this morning not
[1:01:51] thinking about anybody else but those of
[1:01:53] you that are sitting here let's not look
[1:01:55] back let's not look at what yesterday
[1:01:57] was let's look forward there's a future
[1:01:59] for you there's a there's a present to
[1:02:01] live in there's a time that you're
[1:02:02] living in right now that God wants to do
[1:02:05] something for you God wants to move in
[1:02:07] your
[1:02:08] life brother B says look forward look
[1:02:11] where you're going to look where you're
[1:02:13] going not where you came from all right
[1:02:16] so yesterday being in the past and today
[1:02:19] being the only living time now brother
[1:02:22] bam taught us that every age wrecked
[1:02:25] as it looked as its focus became on its
[1:02:28] rear view mirror every age wrecked
[1:02:32] traveling down the road he talked about
[1:02:34] Luther he said the Lutheran wrecked up
[1:02:36] he said because they wanted to stay with
[1:02:38] what Luther had and they couldn't move
[1:02:39] on he said the wesle went down that road
[1:02:42] and they got so far into sanctification
[1:02:44] but then they wrecked and the
[1:02:45] Pentecostals did the same thing they
[1:02:47] went down that road and then they
[1:02:48] wrecked cuz they couldn't get past 1906
[1:02:51] and they couldn't see what God was doing
[1:02:53] in a prophet in our day amen and so what
[1:02:56] what happened is they they actually
[1:02:58] wrecked they actually C went off the
[1:03:00] road but there's going to be a bride who
[1:03:02] doesn't wreck
[1:03:04] up there's got to be a people who don't
[1:03:06] fall there's got to be a bride that
[1:03:08] doesn't do that by the window it's got
[1:03:10] to be somebody brother Miguel that that
[1:03:12] goes forward somebody that walks up
[1:03:14] instead of going down there's there's a
[1:03:16] group that goes down but there's a group
[1:03:18] who goes up and I want to tell you this
[1:03:20] morning I'm part of that group that goes
[1:03:22] up I'm a part of those that are called
[1:03:24] to go higher not to go
[1:03:27] backwards so so I don't want to just
[1:03:29] dwell on yesterday I want to see what
[1:03:31] God has for me today what does he have
[1:03:33] for me in the future amen
[1:03:36] amen so we don't want to wreck up on the
[1:03:39] road so we look forward brother B said
[1:03:41] we're commanded to look forward keep
[1:03:43] going on he says this he said their
[1:03:45] prophecy happened in their days this
[1:03:49] happens in this day and the next happens
[1:03:53] in the next day
[1:03:55] day that's pretty simple but it's good
[1:03:58] their prophecy happened in their days
[1:04:01] this happens in this day and the next
[1:04:04] happens in the next day he said it's
[1:04:07] allotted out to the end time and there's
[1:04:10] things that's supposed to be going on
[1:04:13] now okay and you remember if we could
[1:04:16] focus our attention you know we we're
[1:04:18] looking forward we're looking back and
[1:04:20] we're looking back at last night what a
[1:04:22] wonderful time we had in the bank we're
[1:04:24] looking forward to a youth camp coming
[1:04:26] up and and I'm looking forward to that
[1:04:28] too we're looking forward to something
[1:04:30] else happening but could we focus just
[1:04:32] for a moment on this Services what this
[1:04:34] service what would our services be like
[1:04:36] if we could look at the moment and say
[1:04:38] God I believe you've got something for
[1:04:39] this day you've laed out to the end of
[1:04:42] time you've laed out blessings you've
[1:04:44] laed out Deliverance all of these things
[1:04:46] and you've got something for this
[1:04:47] service this morning something for me he
[1:04:50] said there's things that's supposed to
[1:04:52] be going on right now he said according
[1:04:54] to the scripture the Holy Spirit on
[1:04:56] Earth poured out upon the people I say
[1:04:58] That's supposed to be going on on Sunday
[1:05:00] morning and Sunday night and Wednesday
[1:05:02] night that's what we're called for
[1:05:04] that's the thing that's supposed to be
[1:05:06] going on right
[1:05:08] now so though we see a Rapture in our
[1:05:10] future we see a we see deliverances and
[1:05:13] things in our past but we must recognize
[1:05:16] where we're at
[1:05:19] today now there are some things that I
[1:05:23] have no desire go back
[1:05:25] to we talk about the good old days but I
[1:05:28] don't know if anybody ever remember
[1:05:30] didn't you know that 1956 Chevy that's a
[1:05:31] wonderful thing I we have a man in our
[1:05:33] church brother Harold Bailey he's a
[1:05:35] wonderful man he just had his 80th
[1:05:37] birthday and he drove his Model A or
[1:05:39] Model T Ford to his 80th birthday party
[1:05:43] and it was it's a it's a beautiful car
[1:05:45] but he did it on a day when it was about
[1:05:47] 10 degrees outside and that thing has no
[1:05:51] heat I'm driving up there in our
[1:05:53] Expedition thanking God for modern
[1:05:55] technology
[1:05:58] yeah right because as good as the good
[1:06:01] old days were I got a car that's got
[1:06:03] heated seats not just heat I thank God
[1:06:06] for that
[1:06:07] right I mean it's it's something good
[1:06:10] and and science has progressed in that
[1:06:12] way I I don't have any desire you know I
[1:06:14] like to ride in a horse and Bug eat when
[1:06:16] it's
[1:06:18] convenient right but but you don't want
[1:06:20] to ride in a horse and buggy all the
[1:06:22] time you imagine when you'd had to start
[1:06:23] for church if you were riding in a horse
[1:06:25] and buggy this morning some of yall
[1:06:27] would had to start last
[1:06:30] week right it take you a while to get to
[1:06:32] church in a horse and
[1:06:34] buggy I I like my heated and cooled
[1:06:36] seats I I enjoy the conveniences of life
[1:06:40] and and yet we realize some of those
[1:06:42] things are detrimental and yet yet we we
[1:06:44] still use them I I don't want to buy
[1:06:46] encyclopedias no more right you remember
[1:06:49] when they sold the whole set and I
[1:06:51] remember when I was a kid wanting the
[1:06:52] whole set of the funkin wax or whatever
[1:06:54] they were bratanic encyclopedia you know
[1:06:57] you had the whole set and and I thought
[1:06:59] man if I could only get my hands on
[1:07:00] those i' boy I'd know everything and I
[1:07:02] always love to read and then the
[1:07:04] internet come along and you just got
[1:07:05] Google on your phone and as I said last
[1:07:08] night you can't really trust it because
[1:07:10] uh they'll just put anything on there in
[1:07:12] any order but yet you've got the
[1:07:13] information and I don't want to buy
[1:07:15] encyclopedias no more uh science has
[1:07:18] advanced and I believe God's bride has
[1:07:20] advanced as well that we're moving
[1:07:23] forward am
[1:07:24] and brother brandom talks about that in
[1:07:26] in countdown and he says he said being
[1:07:28] that science has advanced to the space
[1:07:30] that they have to get an astronaut he
[1:07:32] said then the church has advanced he
[1:07:34] said you notice each time it gets
[1:07:36] smaller come on it takes less to
[1:07:39] operating come on okay right so if you
[1:07:41] took your phone I don't have one with me
[1:07:43] but I've got this iPad now if you take
[1:07:45] this iPad it's got a little bitty tiny
[1:07:47] miniature chip in it and what they did
[1:07:49] for years and years you I don't know if
[1:07:51] you remember the old bag phones my
[1:07:52] Grandma had one in her van and some of
[1:07:54] y'all had some didn't you and and those
[1:07:57] things you had a great big bag and you
[1:07:58] take it out like a regular phone and you
[1:08:00] could call only people who had one and
[1:08:02] and it cost a lot of money my grandma I
[1:08:04] don't think she ever used hers because
[1:08:06] it cost so much money to call and she
[1:08:09] just had it it was a status symbol and
[1:08:12] but science has advanced by becoming
[1:08:14] smaller and we're always looking for
[1:08:16] advancement by becoming bigger okay now
[1:08:19] think about it bigger churches bigger
[1:08:21] more people bigger this and that and I
[1:08:23] think we ought to do what we can but
[1:08:24] that's not always advancement sometimes
[1:08:26] advancement is actually becoming smaller
[1:08:29] but within that within that
[1:08:31] miniaturization there's something more
[1:08:33] much more powerful than what there was
[1:08:35] in the great big computer if you go back
[1:08:37] to the 60s you find a computer would
[1:08:39] nearly fill this room and wouldn't have
[1:08:41] the power of what's on your phone today
[1:08:43] what's happening science is going down
[1:08:45] into miniaturization and the bride is
[1:08:48] doing the same thing brother B says as
[1:08:49] it gets smaller it gets more powerful as
[1:08:52] it gets smaller it takes less to operate
[1:08:54] it because brother William each one of
[1:08:56] us is a Dynamo is a power and and we
[1:08:58] become more and more powerful ourselves
[1:09:00] there name may not be many in number
[1:09:02] there may not be thousands of people
[1:09:04] around this around even this area that
[1:09:06] believe what you believe but you're
[1:09:07] powerful in what you have it's been
[1:09:09] condensed down into a group that
[1:09:12] believes what God Said and believes
[1:09:14] something that's happening in their day
[1:09:16] and has happened in their day it's
[1:09:18] condensed down into a
[1:09:21] Powerhouse and brother B tells us God's
[1:09:23] stop building all these other things
[1:09:25] building
[1:09:27] powerhouses
[1:09:29] Hallelujah prise the Lord
[1:09:31] now just because something is smaller
[1:09:34] doesn't mean it's not as good and I want
[1:09:37] to tell you the the burden of my heart
[1:09:39] this
[1:09:40] morning I don't want to go back to an
[1:09:43] airplane
[1:09:45] age though it was better than a vehicle
[1:09:48] age and though it was better than a
[1:09:49] horse and buggy I don't want to go back
[1:09:51] to an airplane age all right I don't
[1:09:54] want to go back to a 1906 ausa Revival
[1:09:58] come on I don't want to go back to a
[1:10:00] 1980s charismatic Revival come on come
[1:10:02] on I don't want to go back to that I
[1:10:05] remember as a kid sitting around in in a
[1:10:07] room and everybody had a prophecy and
[1:10:09] everybody had a this that and the other
[1:10:11] but we got something so much better than
[1:10:13] that why would we go back to the partial
[1:10:15] when we have the
[1:10:16] real brother B said we had partial
[1:10:18] realization now we have complete
[1:10:20] realization we've got the fullness of
[1:10:22] the word why would we go back when we
[1:10:24] can go
[1:10:25] forward when we've got that plus
[1:10:27] Hallelujah brother bandam said that he
[1:10:29] talked about the Lutheran and the wlans
[1:10:31] he said then Along Came the Pentecostal
[1:10:32] Brethren they came back in their age of
[1:10:34] the restoration of the gifts restore
[1:10:36] back the gifts speaking in tongues the
[1:10:37] gifts of healing and things to the
[1:10:39] church and we believe in those things
[1:10:41] don't we all of those things but but we
[1:10:43] have that
[1:10:45] plus right plus now brother R said now
[1:10:48] they did just exactly what the scripture
[1:10:49] said they would do and when they did
[1:10:51] they manifested it he said that's
[1:10:53] exactly right that was the focus of
[1:10:55] their
[1:10:56] age right that that's what everything
[1:10:58] focused on was the tongues and the and
[1:11:00] the gifts of healing and the gifts to
[1:11:02] the church but that is the focus of a
[1:11:04] different
[1:11:06] age I hope you hear me today it's the
[1:11:08] focus we have those things but it's not
[1:11:10] our Focus right he said but did you
[1:11:13] realize we're moving on from that he
[1:11:15] said we are in he calls it the bride
[1:11:17] time the selecting time the time the
[1:11:20] bride they said we would have amen so
[1:11:23] we've got to recognize our day and I
[1:11:26] just want to I just want to deliver my
[1:11:28] heart this morning and I know brother
[1:11:30] Wendell and what he believes and I have
[1:11:31] the freedom to do this but I just want
[1:11:33] to tell you I don't want to go back to
[1:11:35] that but there is something I want to go
[1:11:37] back
[1:11:38] to I want to go I don't want to go back
[1:11:40] but I want to be restored
[1:11:43] back back before there was any there was
[1:11:47] a caner worm back before there was a
[1:11:49] Palmer worm back before I want to be
[1:11:50] restored back all the way yeah amen to
[1:11:54] True Pentecost
[1:11:56] now now brother Bron said the past 25
[1:12:00] years Israel just recognized that
[1:12:02] they're in the Homeland for
[1:12:04] something oh my they're in the Homeland
[1:12:07] for something it was prophesied they'd
[1:12:10] have to be gathered again Hosea said so
[1:12:12] we read it a while ago God help us to
[1:12:14] understand it I wonder if you've
[1:12:15] recognized you're in the church for
[1:12:17] something God put you in py Oklahoma for
[1:12:21] something and it wasn't to always say
[1:12:27] no come on Church it wasn't to always
[1:12:30] drag your feet it wasn't to be a burden
[1:12:32] to the pastor but God put you in Pony
[1:12:34] for something and that something is to
[1:12:37] help out the Bride of Jesus Christ to be
[1:12:39] a help now God put you here for a reason
[1:12:42] God put Israel in their land for a
[1:12:44] reason he said God help us to understand
[1:12:47] he said at the same time the bride has
[1:12:50] recognized the evening light and then he
[1:12:52] said just begin to
[1:12:55] recognize just begin to recognize so am
[1:12:58] I he talked about an infant bride being
[1:13:00] on the church I believe today we
[1:13:02] recognize who we are I believe we
[1:13:04] reached that full realization where we
[1:13:06] recognize who we are if you haven't this
[1:13:08] morning Now's the Time to do it don't
[1:13:10] wait till tomorrow Now's the Time to
[1:13:12] stand up and say I am the Bride of Jesus
[1:13:14] Christ I've been called to hire things
[1:13:17] I've been called to better things I've
[1:13:18] been called to to a place where all the
[1:13:21] promises lay where everything belongs to
[1:13:24] me and you've heard that preach many
[1:13:26] times now he said the world has
[1:13:30] recognized the Nations has recognized
[1:13:33] science has recognized the devil has
[1:13:37] recognized it's the time he can wreck
[1:13:39] women oh if we haven't seen that in our
[1:13:42] day yeah wreck the church we've seen
[1:13:45] that wreck the people right he's
[1:13:49] recognized it there's a lot of people it
[1:13:52] looks good there's a lot of emot but
[1:13:53] it's been
[1:13:55] wrecked it's living off the glare of
[1:13:57] another day yeah and he says if that he
[1:14:00] recognizes that there's a uh there is
[1:14:02] something he it's an opportunity for him
[1:14:05] to wreck the people he recognizes that
[1:14:08] opportunity I wonder if we recognize the
[1:14:10] opportunity we have with what we've been
[1:14:13] given yeah oh my yeah that's
[1:14:18] good he said God has
[1:14:20] recognized that there's a people on
[1:14:22] Earth that he PR destinated to life amen
[1:14:25] he recognized this is the time to send
[1:14:27] his message and he said he's did it he
[1:14:29] said the people has recognized it the
[1:14:31] bride time has realized the evening
[1:14:34] light oh yes he talks about Eve and
[1:14:38] Sarah and Mary those tree women he talks
[1:14:40] about the stalk the tossel and the shuck
[1:14:42] he said all that must dry up it's got to
[1:14:45] die he said and the seed cannot get ripe
[1:14:48] until the shuck stalk and leaves are all
[1:14:51] dry now think about it for it can't get
[1:14:54] ripe until it's all dry that's right it
[1:14:55] saps every bit of the life all the life
[1:15:00] that was in that giant that stalk that
[1:15:02] stood up so high all the life that was
[1:15:04] in the shuck all that life is sucked
[1:15:07] into a little bitty grain of
[1:15:09] wheat all of that life is in that little
[1:15:12] that little miniaturization that
[1:15:15] Powerhouse all the life every bit of the
[1:15:19] life are you with me now there's no life
[1:15:22] anywhere else yeah there's nothing else
[1:15:24] to go to we feel like Peter when he said
[1:15:26] to whom would we go no you alone have
[1:15:29] the words of Life all the life has been
[1:15:31] sucked out of Luther all the life was
[1:15:33] taken out of West all the life was taken
[1:15:36] out of Pentecost and all the life is in
[1:15:38] the bride this morning then whatever we
[1:15:40] have need of we have access to today all
[1:15:43] the Life Is
[1:15:45] Ours amen we should not listen this
[1:15:48] church should not back up to any devil
[1:15:51] should not back up to any situation
[1:15:53] should never say well we're not big
[1:15:55] enough or we're not powerful enough or
[1:15:56] we don't have enough money it should it
[1:15:58] should face every situation and say we
[1:16:01] believe we can do it why do we believe
[1:16:03] we can do it because God put us here for
[1:16:05] a reason we're here for a reason and
[1:16:07] that's to recognize our day and our hour
[1:16:09] everything else is dried up and all the
[1:16:12] life is in us I believe the church ought
[1:16:13] to be alive is that what you believe
[1:16:15] this morning the church ought to be on
[1:16:16] fire if all the life is here we ought to
[1:16:19] be more on fire today than we ever was
[1:16:21] and if we're not we need to go back and
[1:16:23] get that fire rekindled again in our
[1:16:25] life
[1:16:27] amen
[1:16:29] hallelujah
[1:16:33] amen oh
[1:16:35] my now brother Bram said it's it saps
[1:16:39] every bit of the life it's all it was is
[1:16:42] that
[1:16:44] plus that plus now it's seed time or
[1:16:48] bride time the shuts are dead a prophet
[1:16:52] declared it yes the Shucks are dried up
[1:16:55] but this is the Virgin word time not
[1:16:59] touched I love that he said it would not
[1:17:01] be
[1:17:02] manhandled oh my that's the way I feel
[1:17:05] this morning I've not been touched by
[1:17:07] another another another Doctrine or
[1:17:10] another religion I've not been
[1:17:11] manhandled by Creeds but I am a believer
[1:17:14] that has been touched by the message of
[1:17:16] the hour I'm somebody who's been touched
[1:17:18] by the groom not by anybody else amen
[1:17:22] you understand now B said if I taught
[1:17:25] you a Methodist message it'd take no
[1:17:26] effect on you know I'm going somewhere
[1:17:28] this morning so I felt like I just
[1:17:29] needed to kind of lay this in oey the
[1:17:32] Lord he said he said if Moses if I
[1:17:34] taught you a Methodist message it'd take
[1:17:35] no effect on you this is bride time if
[1:17:39] Moses taught the message of Noah would
[1:17:41] take no effect if Jesus taught Moses
[1:17:44] message it would take no effect he said
[1:17:46] denominational ages are dead and dry
[1:17:48] listen the bride will not be formed I
[1:17:50] want you to understand this the bride
[1:17:52] this bride will not not be formed under
[1:17:54] dead conditions yeah okay now think
[1:17:57] about it for a minute why why why can't
[1:17:58] you put a a an egg under a dead hen all
[1:18:02] right it's a hen but it's a dead hen
[1:18:03] well the dead hen has no warmth right
[1:18:06] has no atmosphere so brother brand said
[1:18:09] it has to be under condition condition
[1:18:10] for the age he said a Pentecostal listen
[1:18:13] a Pentecostal atmosphere I'm talking
[1:18:15] about 1906 Pentecost will not produce a
[1:18:18] bride right right because that Pentecost
[1:18:21] is dead yeah right right it's a dead hen
[1:18:25] yeah and it's trying to hatch out now
[1:18:27] what happens to an egg when it's under a
[1:18:28] hen some of y'all know more about this
[1:18:29] than I do but we raise chickens you know
[1:18:32] what happens under under a hen that dyes
[1:18:34] or a hen that doesn't sit properly an
[1:18:37] egg that's not been fertilized
[1:18:38] something's wrong with it what happens
[1:18:39] to it it doesn't mature it doesn't form
[1:18:43] into a chicken okay okay right it's just
[1:18:46] it's just a mess right so in order to
[1:18:49] bring order out of a a Yol I think
[1:18:51] brother juel was the one used to say he
[1:18:53] didn't like eggs he said I like the
[1:18:54] mystery of my chicken
[1:18:56] revealed
[1:18:58] and and I'm kind I actually like eggs
[1:19:01] but but there is a kind of a messiness
[1:19:03] to it isn't there it's it's it's all
[1:19:05] over the place it's just a jumo but
[1:19:07] within it is the potential to become a
[1:19:09] chicken but it can't become a chicken
[1:19:12] unless it comes up under the right
[1:19:13] conditions and it can't come up under a
[1:19:16] dead hen oh that's why the the bride's
[1:19:19] always going to have life in her there
[1:19:20] always must be life in the bride and
[1:19:22] there is life in the bride it may not be
[1:19:25] it may not seem like the life of
[1:19:26] Pentecost because we're manifesting
[1:19:27] something else it may not seem like the
[1:19:29] life of Luther we're manifesting
[1:19:31] something else it may not seem like even
[1:19:32] the life life of Wesley but we're
[1:19:34] manifesting it something different in
[1:19:36] our day but the life is
[1:19:38] there are you with me so
[1:19:41] far so the bride will not be formed
[1:19:43] under dead conditions he said it has to
[1:19:44] be under condition you can take a good
[1:19:46] live egg he said and put it put it under
[1:19:48] a dead hen it won't hatch he said it's
[1:19:50] the condition he said well that's the
[1:19:52] way it is in this age that we're living
[1:19:53] in you got to find out what is God's way
[1:19:56] of doing it for this age yeah he said
[1:19:58] that's what Martin Luther found that's
[1:20:00] what John Wesley found that's what the
[1:20:02] Pentecostals found in their age God's
[1:20:03] age and time to do it why would we get
[1:20:05] wrapped up in what God did in an age
[1:20:08] when the word was not fully revealed
[1:20:09] let's find out what he's doing in this
[1:20:11] day and follow that you so how am I
[1:20:13] going to know what he's doing today we
[1:20:15] had a prophet coming our day and tell us
[1:20:17] exactly where we are and point out to us
[1:20:20] the place on the map where we're at amen
[1:20:22] amen that's right bless the name of the
[1:20:25] Lord bless the Lord hallelujah he said
[1:20:28] that's what Martin Luther found and John
[1:20:30] Wesley founds what the Pentecostal found
[1:20:31] in their age God's age and time to do it
[1:20:36] and that's what we found in our age now
[1:20:38] there is something we need to go back to
[1:20:41] yes sir right because we have to go back
[1:20:45] to our
[1:20:46] future and I want to contend with with
[1:20:49] you and for you and to you today that
[1:20:52] our future is the
[1:20:55] message all right our future is the
[1:20:57] message that's already come our future
[1:21:00] is not some man that may raise up or
[1:21:03] some Revival that might come along or
[1:21:05] some some stir that might come along our
[1:21:08] future is this messag amen our future is
[1:21:12] contained so we're not looking we're not
[1:21:14] waiting it out and saying well this is
[1:21:16] good but we can't wait to see what's
[1:21:18] next but our future is actually in being
[1:21:21] restored back by the message of the hour
[1:21:24] so that is our future now he's taking us
[1:21:27] back in this age but he's not just
[1:21:28] taking us back to another age but he's
[1:21:30] taking us back to to a Rapture condition
[1:21:34] amen he's taking us back to a place now
[1:21:36] look what brother brandom had the vision
[1:21:38] of of the bride and preview of The Bride
[1:21:40] he talked about how that here come a
[1:21:42] here come a a church of America he
[1:21:45] talked about how evil they were all the
[1:21:47] things that were going on there dancing
[1:21:49] to rock and roll music how they come
[1:21:50] down through there and and they begin to
[1:21:52] they begin to move off and it might seem
[1:21:54] attractive to some people but to a
[1:21:56] prophet it looked horrible it looked
[1:21:58] awful and so he's watching them as they
[1:22:00] as they go down now he's watching them
[1:22:02] they're going down they're going down
[1:22:04] into hell they're going down into
[1:22:05] destruction and he's watching them going
[1:22:07] down he said oh God he said what's going
[1:22:09] to happen is that all we could produce
[1:22:11] and all of a sudden here come a bride
[1:22:13] remember he I don't have to give you the
[1:22:15] whole he he had a there was a bride she
[1:22:17] was dressed appropriately she was
[1:22:18] marching to honored Christian Soldiers
[1:22:20] she was she was a bride that was in step
[1:22:22] with the word and she was not going down
[1:22:24] she was going
[1:22:26] up but I want to tell you this morning
[1:22:29] that if you're in that bride that's
[1:22:31] going up you can't be in that bride
[1:22:33] that's going down all right you're one
[1:22:36] or the other and you might have people
[1:22:38] come around try to scare you and say
[1:22:39] well if you're not careful you'll be
[1:22:41] that church that's going you're not the
[1:22:42] church that's going down you're the
[1:22:44] church that's going
[1:22:45] up right you're the church is going up
[1:22:48] so I'm not here to scare you and try to
[1:22:49] say well you're you're part of that
[1:22:50] church that's going down that's not our
[1:22:52] problem prophecy we're the ones that are
[1:22:53] going up and yet Among Us he said there
[1:22:57] was some at the end he said maybe after
[1:22:58] I'm gone it began to get out of line he
[1:23:00] said they they stepped out and he said
[1:23:02] they were watching that other group they
[1:23:04] were maybe watching and listening they
[1:23:06] got out of Step you know how you would
[1:23:07] if there was two different kinds of
[1:23:09] music going on I'm not talking about
[1:23:11] music this morning but if there were two
[1:23:12] different kinds of music you'd get out
[1:23:14] of Step if you begin to listen to the
[1:23:16] other kind of music the other style of
[1:23:17] music they got out of Step because they
[1:23:19] were watching he said what that other
[1:23:21] church was doing oh God help us today we
[1:23:24] don't want to watch the churches going
[1:23:25] down Lutheran going down West is going
[1:23:28] down Pentecost is going down but the
[1:23:30] bride's going
[1:23:31] up and we are not called to watch that
[1:23:33] church it's going down we'll get out of
[1:23:35] Step if we do but we're called to go
[1:23:38] up so if we're called to go up there's a
[1:23:42] prophet's voice that begin to cry out
[1:23:44] get back in
[1:23:46] line oh and that's what I want to get
[1:23:48] back to this morning that's my future is
[1:23:51] this message my future future is the
[1:23:53] opening of the book my future is found
[1:23:55] in the word being fully revealed my
[1:23:57] future is when everything become mine
[1:24:00] I'm not looking for something else to
[1:24:01] follow some other move of God some other
[1:24:04] Revival somewhere else but this is the
[1:24:06] bride Revival this is my future

[1:24:46] you the word of God is alive it's
[1:24:48] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:24:50] sword piercing even to the dividing is
[1:24:53] under a Soul and Spirit it can tell the
[1:24:55] difference between just theemotion and
[1:24:56] the true move of the Holy Ghost it can
[1:24:58] it can tell the difference between the
[1:25:00] the outside realm and the inside realm
[1:25:02] when it's God that's actually moving
[1:25:04] that this word can tell the difference
[1:25:06] it is the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:25:07] tense of the heart it rightly
[1:25:09] divides amen now watch it has life in it

[1:27:04] thoughts about us right and when we see
[1:27:07] God's thoughts about us and we begin to
[1:27:09] identify with those thoughts we begin to
[1:27:10] realize that's me we're going back I
[1:27:14] don't want to go back to 1906 I don't
[1:27:16] want to go back to the 1980s some people
[1:27:17] want to go back well in the 9s we had
[1:27:19] more Fellowship around the message I
[1:27:21] don't want to go back to the '90s I want
[1:27:23] to go back to the message of the hour
[1:27:25] let me live the message let me believe
[1:27:27] the message let me have an open book let
[1:27:29] me believe what a prophet
[1:27:31] said we're going back because that
[1:27:33] Prophet took us back to the back part of
[1:27:35] God's mind look at Christ The Mystery of
[1:27:37] God revealed brother brandom said now
[1:27:38] God's secret mystery he had before the
[1:27:40] world began back in the back part of
[1:27:42] God's mind there was something he was
[1:27:44] trying and was going to achieve he said
[1:27:47] and he had a motive in doing it in order
[1:27:49] to let himself be expressed he talked
[1:27:51] about how he wasn't God and he became
[1:27:53] God when he had he was an object of
[1:27:55] worship he said now God had a purpose
[1:27:57] and a hidden Mystery he said that's what
[1:27:59] I want to speak onto the church this
[1:28:00] morning the hidden Mystery that of God
[1:28:02] that he had in his mind before the world
[1:28:04] ever began he said how that it's
[1:28:06] unfolded itself right down to this
[1:28:08] present hour that we're living see then
[1:28:10] you will understand clearly then I
[1:28:12] believe in what is being
[1:28:14] done you're going back to
[1:28:17] timelessness it's eternity back to oh my
[1:28:20] is it where we going back to 1963 no

[1:28:32] grandparents but this message is eternal
[1:28:35] it come from the Throne of God and it
[1:28:36] brought us back to the thoughts of God

[1:31:07] sons of God without inhibition without
[1:31:10] worrying about the person next to them
[1:31:11] they all shouted for
[1:31:15] Joy yes sir amen we shouted there yeah
[1:31:20] yeah so we can shout here
[1:31:22] that's going back now look heard a
[1:31:25] message spirit said well we don't need
[1:31:26] to shout what would we need to shout for
[1:31:28] well I shouted
[1:31:30] there oh my I shouted there I'm not
[1:31:33] going to wait till I get to heaven to
[1:31:34] shout again because I believe the
[1:31:35] message of the hour is for
[1:31:38] today amen amen yes sir Jeremiah 29:11
[1:31:42] you've heard this many times he said but
[1:31:43] I know the thoughts that I think towards
[1:31:46] you this message is the thoughts of God
[1:31:49] to us it takes takes us back to what the
[1:31:53] Lord thought about us which is thoughts
[1:31:55] of peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:31:57] expected end now watch carefully brother
[1:32:00] B said and see this before there was
[1:32:01] ever a speck of Stardust before God was
[1:32:04] God God is an object of adoration no one
[1:32:06] was there to worship him so he was at
[1:32:07] that time only potentially God he was
[1:32:09] known only as eternal spirit the bride
[1:32:11] was already in his mind he said yes she
[1:32:13] was she was existing in his thoughts he
[1:32:17] said what about those thoughts of God
[1:32:18] they are Eternal are they not he said
[1:32:20] the Eternal thoughts of of God let me
[1:32:22] ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal
[1:32:24] he said if you can see this you'll see
[1:32:25] many things I just love that statement
[1:32:28] if you can see that the thoughts of God
[1:32:30] are Eternal and that the bride is the
[1:32:32] thoughts of God and that you are the
[1:32:34] bride you'll see many
[1:32:36] things Hallelujah brother Brandon tells
[1:32:38] us three things about God he tells us
[1:32:40] he's
[1:32:41] unchangeable I love that about God he
[1:32:43] tells us he's infinite in his ability
[1:32:46] and he tells us he is omniscient he
[1:32:48] knows everything right Brother Band said
[1:32:51] he's never had a new thought about
[1:32:54] anything someone say anything anything
[1:32:57] never had a new thought about anything
[1:33:00] because all his thoughts he has always
[1:33:03] had and always will have I love that and
[1:33:07] knows the end from the beginning because
[1:33:09] he is God Amen thus the thoughts of God
[1:33:13] are Eternal they are real they are not
[1:33:15] simply like a man with a blueprint he
[1:33:17] was drawn up which one day will be
[1:33:18] translated into substance and form but
[1:33:20] they are already real and eternal and
[1:33:22] part of God he's not bound by time at
[1:33:25] all the thoughts of God are
[1:33:28] real hallelujah oh what that ought to
[1:33:31] mean to us he's not a builder with a
[1:33:32] blueprint where something might go wrong
[1:33:34] or the plumber might not show up on time
[1:33:36] or the electrician might not show up on
[1:33:38] time but he's God it's already done in
[1:33:40] his mind it's already completed hallu
[1:33:43] Hallelujah David tells us in Psalms 139
[1:33:46] brother brand references this in the
[1:33:47] church age book he said my substance was
[1:33:49] not hid from thee when I was made in
[1:33:51] secret and curiously wrought in the
[1:33:52] lower parts of the earth he said Thine
[1:33:54] Eyes did see my substance yet being
[1:33:56] unperfect in thy book all my members
[1:33:58] were written which in continuous were
[1:34:00] fashion when as yet there was none of
[1:34:02] them how precious also are thy thoughts
[1:34:04] toward me oh God how great is the sum of
[1:34:07] them listen it would do something to us
[1:34:09] we' we'd have tears running down our
[1:34:11] face we we'd begin to speak out in the
[1:34:13] house of God we'd begin to worship like
[1:34:15] never before if we realize how precious
[1:34:18] the thoughts of God were towards us
[1:34:20] before we were ever born before we were
[1:34:22] ever formed in our mother's
[1:34:25] womb
[1:34:27] hallu brother brandom bless the name of
[1:34:31] Lord says this glory to God oh I just
[1:34:34] love him this morning don't
[1:34:37] you now watch this brother BR said and
[1:34:40] back
[1:34:42] there where in the mind of
[1:34:45] God back there if I could have known as
[1:34:51] I I know
[1:34:52] now oh my what a revelation this is
[1:34:55] Brother wend this helps us because we
[1:34:58] look back and say well things were
[1:34:59] better but look if I could have known as
[1:35:02] I know now and could have looked over
[1:35:04] the whole span of time and he would have
[1:35:09] said to me what time do you want to
[1:35:12] live now think about that for a minute
[1:35:14] you you might get all caught up and say
[1:35:16] well I would love to live back when
[1:35:18] brother Brandon was here but God put you
[1:35:20] here for a reason yeah I would have
[1:35:22] loved to have seen the revivals of John
[1:35:23] Wesley I'd have loved to see I'd just
[1:35:25] love to see somebody preaching that many
[1:35:26] people without a
[1:35:29] microphone we become dependent on these
[1:35:31] things and I'd just love to have seen it
[1:35:33] I'd have loved to have seen I'd have Lov
[1:35:35] to seen when Jesus was on the earth I'd
[1:35:36] have Lov to seen when he sat down
[1:35:38] brother the kby and he taught the people
[1:35:39] and they all sat down on the hill and he
[1:35:41] sat down on the hill and he be precious
[1:35:43] words begin to proceed from his mouth
[1:35:45] brother brother say was the greatest
[1:35:46] anointing that was ever on him don't
[1:35:47] knock your pastor when it seems like
[1:35:49] well he's not fire he's not anointed
[1:35:51] listen the most brother BR said the
[1:35:52] greatest anointing that was ever on a
[1:35:53] man was Jesus sitting down on the
[1:35:55] hillside and speaking to the people
[1:35:58] blessed are the peacemakers all
[1:36:01] right what was I would have loved to go
[1:36:03] back and and sit there and listen to
[1:36:05] those things I'd have loved to go back
[1:36:07] to the day of Pentecost and experienced
[1:36:09] what they experienced and been there in
[1:36:10] that upper I would have loved to have
[1:36:11] been there but he said if I could have
[1:36:13] chosen a time if I could have chosen a
[1:36:15] day that I could go back to he said I
[1:36:18] would have went back I have said this
[1:36:19] time right now I wonder if we have a
[1:36:21] revelation of that today you were called
[1:36:23] for this day not for another day if I
[1:36:26] could pick a time in my life listen you
[1:36:29] might have been 20 you might have been
[1:36:30] 40 you might have been 60 brother the
[1:36:32] dur but he said if I could pick a time
[1:36:33] to live it'd be right now because you're
[1:36:35] closer to that body change than you ever
[1:36:37] have been you're going to step into it
[1:36:39] one of these days he's taking you back
[1:36:41] to your future hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:36:44] if we can only get a revelation of that
[1:36:46] old age wouldn't bother us trouble
[1:36:48] wouldn't bother us situations wouldn't
[1:36:49] bother us why because we're Going Back
[1:36:51] to the Future amen hallelujah the more
[1:36:55] broken down we become the more old older
[1:36:57] we get the closer we are to going
[1:37:05] backless hallu he said i' said this time
[1:37:07] right now just the eve of the ending up
[1:37:10] of world history and the oncoming of the
[1:37:12] kingdom of God to be established in the
[1:37:15] earth he said I think it's the most
[1:37:17] glorious time of all ages is right
[1:37:25] now I say God take me
[1:37:30] back I remember a time in my life when I
[1:37:33] was young I was 16 years old and and and
[1:37:36] already out of the house and I was
[1:37:37] helping a little church in Texar Canada
[1:37:39] Texas I'd go down there in the afternoon
[1:37:40] and I'd pray sometimes for hours at a
[1:37:42] time and it's all I had to do I didn't
[1:37:44] have any money I didn't have any I just
[1:37:46] stay stay there in the church and prayed
[1:37:47] and I remember what that time was like
[1:37:49] you guys that are that are that age
[1:37:50] you're a little bit older you you don't
[1:37:52] know what a precious time it is to be
[1:37:53] able to have time to spend with God now
[1:37:55] I'm older I got kids I got a wife we got
[1:37:57] a church we got things that we have to
[1:37:59] deal with all the time and I look back
[1:38:00] at that time say what a wonderful time
[1:38:02] but if you gave me an option I'd go back
[1:38:04] to today I want to go to today because
[1:38:07] he's done more for me today than he's
[1:38:08] ever done I remember what it was like I
[1:38:11] remember sometimes like job we begin to
[1:38:12] think I remember when my steps were
[1:38:14] washed with butter and oil I remember
[1:38:16] when the secret of God was upon me I
[1:38:18] remember the presence of God so real
[1:38:20] that I be to talk in another language I
[1:38:22] I remember what that's like but I'm not
[1:38:24] going back to that I'm going back to the
[1:38:26] beginning back to the thoughts of
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:36] God hallelujah you can't get too caught
[1:38:39] up in how you feel cuz how you feel is
[1:38:40] going to
[1:38:42] change and if you're not careful you
[1:38:44] just constantly begin to seek emotion
[1:38:46] and seek emotion and seek emotion but
[1:38:48] the word of God is unchangeable come on
[1:38:52] we need emotion we need times when we're
[1:38:54] just bathed over in the presence of God
[1:38:57] yes we need the times when we're drunk
[1:38:59] on the spirit of God and I believe that
[1:39:01] that could be every service we could get
[1:39:03] that way but let me say this there's
[1:39:05] going to be times you just don't feel it
[1:39:08] and it's in those hours that you have to
[1:39:09] say I'm going back to my
[1:39:15] future when God is silent it seems like
[1:39:17] the heavens are brass and things are not
[1:39:19] going like they should I'm going back to
[1:39:21] my
[1:39:22] future let me do the work of God let me
[1:39:25] be a volunteer let me be willing to do
[1:39:27] whatever I'm asked to do because I'm
[1:39:29] going back to my future I'm not looking
[1:39:31] at the temporary hurt or the temporary
[1:39:33] hardness or the temporary hardships I'm
[1:39:35] not looking at those things but like
[1:39:36] Paul said I see a crown ahead of me a
[1:39:39] Crown of Life at the end of the road I
[1:39:40] refuse to look at my bonds I refuse to
[1:39:42] look at the prison I refuse to look at
[1:39:44] the change I'm going back to what
[1:39:47] was I want to take all those with me
[1:39:49] that I can
[1:39:52] now if we know I just got just a few
[1:39:55] more minutes and we'll
[1:39:57] close you don't know how many a few
[1:40:00] minutes
[1:40:04] are on listen how can we go back to what
[1:40:10] God said it takes the Holy Ghost let's
[1:40:12] just be real about this we can't do it
[1:40:14] in our own power it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:40:17] to bring us back to the message of the
[1:40:19] hour he said he would give us the power
[1:40:21] to become Sons what is that power his
[1:40:23] own life the token life back on the
[1:40:25] believer that's the power that makes the
[1:40:27] Sons and Daughters of God without it we
[1:40:29] cannot go back to our future I want you
[1:40:31] to notice how brother bam answered us a
[1:40:32] question in paragraph 39 of questions
[1:40:34] and answers number two in 1964 if you
[1:40:37] want to go look it up he answers a
[1:40:38] question about the Holy Ghost and and
[1:40:41] and how do you uh how do you know is is
[1:40:43] it an experience or is it uh is it
[1:40:45] something else is it just you take it by
[1:40:47] faith he said now that's a good question
[1:40:49] he said now the baptism with the Holy
[1:40:50] Spirit
[1:40:51] is a definite experience that a person
[1:40:54] must receive yeah he talks about how the
[1:40:56] evidence wasn't tongues he talks about
[1:40:58] how he thought it was love but he found
[1:40:59] out it wasn't even love because even the
[1:41:01] Pharisees could have love he said
[1:41:03] there's only one evidence of the holy
[1:41:04] spirit that I know of and that is a
[1:41:06] genuine faith in the promised word of
[1:41:08] the hour notice how he puts it a genuine
[1:41:11] faith in a pro in the promised word of
[1:41:13] the hour that's the hour that we live in
[1:41:15] he said now he said when a man receives
[1:41:17] Christ in the manner that he is in I'm
[1:41:20] skipping through the you can tell by the
[1:41:21] paragraph numbers but when you have time
[1:41:23] it's a long answer you can read it for
[1:41:25] yourself he said but when a man receives
[1:41:26] Christ in the manner that he is in he
[1:41:29] said you can't accept it as being he
[1:41:30] said now some of them say well I'm a
[1:41:31] Lutheran well there's nothing against
[1:41:33] that but the Eagles don't feed on that
[1:41:35] that was as far as it was that was fresh
[1:41:37] food for that day I'm a Wesley and
[1:41:39] that's all right but you're living in
[1:41:40] the past he said so being a well- Tred
[1:41:42] Theologian had nothing to do with it
[1:41:44] being meenal had nothing to do with he
[1:41:46] talks about Christ he said what made him
[1:41:47] different he said he was the word made
[1:41:50] flesh not the word for the day of Moses
[1:41:52] Moses was that day he said not for the
[1:41:54] Days of Elijah Elijah was the word for
[1:41:56] that day but he was the present tense
[1:41:58] word and they were living in the back
[1:42:01] okay right they were living in the back
[1:42:03] but not far not far enough back are you
[1:42:06] with me now they were living in
[1:42:08] yesterday but they were living in what
[1:42:10] they could remember but I want to live
[1:42:12] in what God
[1:42:15] remembers are you with me now
[1:42:18] now he said he was the present tense
[1:42:21] word and they were living in the back he
[1:42:22] said the same thing repeats he said
[1:42:25] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:27] when God reveals to you and you see it
[1:42:29] thus sayith the Lord and you accept it
[1:42:32] he said not what you are not what you
[1:42:34] was or nothing about it it's what God
[1:42:36] has done for you now he said there's the
[1:42:38] evidence he said now the Holy Spirit
[1:42:39] when he comes it's a witness unto you
[1:42:41] that this word is right how many believe
[1:42:43] that today I know the Bible is right
[1:42:45] they used to sing in the black church I
[1:42:47] know the Bible is right that means
[1:42:48] somebody's
[1:42:49] wrong
[1:42:51] I know the Bible is Right somebody's
[1:42:53] wrong that's the truth isn't it he said
[1:42:55] the word it'll tell you that the word is
[1:42:56] right but not just the word for another
[1:42:58] day the word for this day he said not
[1:43:01] the word for Luther not the word for
[1:43:03] Moses we witness this the truth but it's
[1:43:04] another day he said what if Jesus would
[1:43:06] come and say now Moses as Moses come Tak
[1:43:08] you out of Egypt I've come taking you
[1:43:10] somewhere else what if he said let's go
[1:43:12] to work and build an ark I'm the Lord
[1:43:15] God I'm going to float the world away
[1:43:16] now I'm going to drown the world he said
[1:43:18] the scripture never said he'd come like
[1:43:20] that
[1:43:21] he wouldn't have been the Messiah no
[1:43:22] matter how much Ark he' built whatever
[1:43:24] he'd done he'd have not qualified the
[1:43:25] Messiah there you are it's a
[1:43:27] qualification what was it it was
[1:43:28] evidence of who he was what is it today
[1:43:31] evidence of who you are you're not
[1:43:33] looking for another message but you've
[1:43:34] got the message of the hour you believe
[1:43:36] the message of the hour and it's an
[1:43:38] Evidence of who you are
[1:43:40] now and you manifest that
[1:43:43] word
[1:43:45] now Christ was that which is perfect how
[1:43:49] many believe that yes sir aren't you
[1:43:51] glad we had a perfect
[1:43:53] lamb amen he was examined he was found
[1:43:57] perfect he was that which is perfect
[1:44:01] that which is perfect didn't need to
[1:44:03] replay that which was in part okay he he
[1:44:07] didn't have to he was the ark he didn't
[1:44:10] need to build an ark because he was the
[1:44:13] ark amen he didn't have to relive
[1:44:16] Joseph's Day or or or Paul or or or one
[1:44:18] of the Old Testament Saints Day as day
[1:44:21] or Jeremiah's day he could live in his
[1:44:23] day because he was the perfect
[1:44:25] realization do you realize what you what
[1:44:27] you are back in all the other ages they
[1:44:29] were just the types of a bride but you
[1:44:32] today are the bride there was bride in
[1:44:34] every age but they without us could not
[1:44:36] be made
[1:44:37] perfect Hallelujah they were just a type
[1:44:40] of you they were looking forward to you
[1:44:42] they're waiting on
[1:44:44] you and Paul tells us that we know in
[1:44:46] part and we prophesy in part but when
[1:44:47] that which is perfect has come that
[1:44:49] which is in part should be done away not
[1:44:51] the true gifts won't be done away but
[1:44:53] it'll be that which is in part that part
[1:44:55] that fails 1 Corinthians 13 says this
[1:44:57] when that which is perfect is come that
[1:44:58] which is in part should be done away
[1:44:59] with he said all these things are
[1:45:00] jumping up and down like a kid trying to
[1:45:02] talk in tongues he's talking about as an
[1:45:03] Evidence of the Holy Ghost people trying
[1:45:05] to get the Holy Ghost by speaking in
[1:45:07] tongues all these other things when that
[1:45:09] which is perfect he said we do have
[1:45:11] today oh I know you've heard it before
[1:45:13] but hear it again this morning we have
[1:45:15] today by God's help the perfect
[1:45:17] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:45:20] vindication
[1:45:22] then that which is in part is done away
[1:45:24] with do you believe it
[1:45:26] today what are we going back to back to
[1:45:30] a true Pentecostal experience back to
[1:45:33] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost back
[1:45:35] to the manifestation of the word for our
[1:45:37] day back to the faith once delivered to
[1:45:39] the Saints listen there had to come a
[1:45:41] time that the veil was rent and the Old
[1:45:43] Testament was the Old Testament
[1:45:45] sacrifice was no more it couldn't do
[1:45:47] have any more effect on the people the
[1:45:49] veil was rent and the mercy seat that
[1:45:51] was there become a judgment seat and The
[1:45:52] Mercy Seat was there hanging on a cross
[1:45:54] you all know what brother T the
[1:45:56] unveiling of God how did The Mercy Seat
[1:45:58] come into full View and Paul tells us he
[1:46:00] said we all with open face beholding as
[1:46:02] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:46:04] changed into the same image from glory
[1:46:06] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:46:08] Lord we're coming into something what
[1:46:09] are we doing we went back to a place
[1:46:11] where the word was unveiled we went back
[1:46:13] to a place where the word where the book
[1:46:15] was open and when we went back we saw
[1:46:18] ourselves in a future image and we're
[1:46:20] change into that
[1:46:22] image Hallelujah I'm not done being
[1:46:25] changed for the window I was changed
[1:46:27] last week I'm changed this week the more
[1:46:28] I look at it the more I become what it
[1:46:30] says am the more I become what it is oh
[1:46:34] my can we say Amen to that
[1:46:37] today
[1:46:38] amen bless the name of the Lord that's
[1:46:42] good pre thank you Jesus that's what the
[1:46:44] church has done he said it come from
[1:46:45] Luther Westley back to the original
[1:46:46] grain back to its original Glory back to
[1:46:49] the glory it was at the beginning
[1:46:51] he said the same son manifesting the
[1:46:53] same thing in the west changing from
[1:46:54] glory to glory it changed from Pagan
[1:46:56] into Luther from Luther into Wesley wesy
[1:46:58] the Pentecost on and on changing from
[1:47:00] glory to glory producing the hidden mana
[1:47:02] and now it's ripe to bring him back
[1:47:05] exactly like he was at the beginning the
[1:47:07] same Ministry the same Jesus the Same
[1:47:09] power the same Holy
[1:47:11] Ghost Hallelujah the same one that come
[1:47:14] down on the day of Pentecost
[1:47:18] amen that's what he says
[1:47:21] Hallelujah this the same Holy Ghost
[1:47:23] that's manifest today from Glory into
[1:47:24] glory to glory back to its original seed
[1:47:27] all right with the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:29] Ghost the same signs same wonders same
[1:47:32] bapt not some not some Pentecostal
[1:47:35] interpretation of the signs but not some
[1:47:37] Pentecostal or Methodist interpretation
[1:47:39] of the gifts but the same signs yeah the
[1:47:42] same wonders the same baptism same kind
[1:47:44] of people acting the same way if they
[1:47:47] got drunk on the spirit I can too yeah
[1:47:50] with the same power he even says the
[1:47:53] same sensation yeah right now Sensations
[1:47:58] can be good or bad love is a sensation
[1:48:01] and so is hate feelings can be good or
[1:48:04] bad but we always match them up with the
[1:48:06] word so it's the same sensation what
[1:48:08] same as what not 1906 when Pentecost
[1:48:11] come along not 1738 when when Wesley got
[1:48:16] saved 1517 when Luther nailed the the 95
[1:48:20] thesis to the door of vinberg oh my not
[1:48:23] to that but back to acts two because
[1:48:26] acts two was what God had in his mind
[1:48:28] for the church
[1:48:30] glory glory to God but I want you to
[1:48:33] know that this age doesn't stop at acts
[1:48:37] to cuz that age had to go down in the
[1:48:39] ground it was their Destiny to go down
[1:48:41] in the ground but now brother we have a
[1:48:43] predestined bride a predestined for
[1:48:45] somebody that's not going down they're
[1:48:47] going up this age is going back not just
[1:48:49] to act too we're going all the way back
[1:48:51] to the mind of God and what it was for
[1:48:54] us before the
[1:48:55] beginning the veil of denomination was
[1:48:57] rent but the BR said it was from glory
[1:48:59] to glory and the next will be remember
[1:49:01] what he said there was there yesterday
[1:49:03] was had its prophecy tomorrow has its
[1:49:06] prophecy but there's something something
[1:49:07] for today and something that's next and
[1:49:10] listen what he says is next the next
[1:49:11] will be changeed amen from this Glory oh
[1:49:15] I'm looking forward to it I'm changed
[1:49:17] from this Glory into a body like his own
[1:49:20] his body where we shall see him he said
[1:49:22] Abraham saw the same so God took Abraham
[1:49:27] back to his future yeah yeah you realize
[1:49:30] that he didn't just take him back to his
[1:49:32] past because taking him back to his past
[1:49:35] was insufficient yeah because if you'll
[1:49:37] remember when Abraham was 21 yeah he and
[1:49:40] Sarah were probably already married so
[1:49:42] if he took him back to 21 they couldn't
[1:49:44] have children then yeah yeah he did not
[1:49:47] oh God I hope you understand he did not
[1:49:50] take him back to just 21 but he took him
[1:49:52] back into his own thoughts to a place
[1:49:54] where he was perfect
[1:49:57] yeah you watch what he did I wish I had
[1:49:59] the voice of strength to preach it this
[1:50:01] morning you watch what he did he going
[1:50:02] back we're going back to a Rapture he
[1:50:04] took Abraham and went back to his future
[1:50:06] he was a young man again but this time
[1:50:08] he could produce the promised son what
[1:50:09] did he do he took Abraham back Beyond
[1:50:11] his mistakes yes sir on Hallelujah
[1:50:16] because there was no mistake in his
[1:50:18] future so when Paul wrote about Abraham
[1:50:20] he said he staggered not at the promise
[1:50:22] of God through unbelief why because he
[1:50:24] took him back took him back to his
[1:50:27] future oh my I say God take me back
[1:50:29] today I don't want to go back to just
[1:50:31] emotionalism I don't want to go back to
[1:50:33] just things that I was yesterday I want
[1:50:35] to go back to the pureness of God take
[1:50:37] me back to my new body take me back to
[1:50:40] what God has for me in his mind come on
[1:50:43] brother bless the Lord that's what this
[1:50:46] message came to do that's what's next
[1:50:49] amen oh I'm so glad I know what's next
[1:50:51] you don't know about tomorrow but I Know
[1:50:53] Who Holds Tomorrow and I know what's
[1:50:55] next what's next is a change of my body
[1:50:58] hallelujah thank you Jesus Glory thank
[1:51:02] you
[1:51:06] lordless we're going back to this 1
[1:51:09] Corinthians 15151 behold I show you a
[1:51:11] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[1:51:14] shall all be
[1:51:17] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:51:20] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[1:51:22] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:51:25] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:51:27] and brother brandom goes back in the
[1:51:29] mind of God and tells us about this
[1:51:33] scripture he says then we'll all get
[1:51:35] together and when they begin to get
[1:51:37] together then we which are alive and
[1:51:39] remain shall be changed these mortal
[1:51:44] bodies will not see death hallu but just
[1:51:47] of a sudden there will be like a sweep
[1:51:50] go over us and you're changed you're
[1:51:53] turned back like Abraham was right yes
[1:51:58] sir oh if we just realize your mistakes
[1:52:01] are not your future your old age is not
[1:52:03] your future your gray hair is not your
[1:52:05] future our bald spots are not our
[1:52:08] future but we're going back we're not
[1:52:11] just going back he's taking us back to
[1:52:12] like we were at 21 but without sin
[1:52:15] without without what we went through
[1:52:16] without all of the things that messed us
[1:52:18] up without all the family history
[1:52:20] without all the drama oh my he's taking
[1:52:22] us back to what we were said God had a
[1:52:26] picture of you and he knew what you
[1:52:29] would be and he's taking you back to
[1:52:34] that my he said what's this Sudden
[1:52:37] Change he said after a while you're
[1:52:39] traveling like a thought and you can see
[1:52:42] those then who are already resurrected
[1:52:44] oh what an hour he said then we'll
[1:52:46] gather with them and then be caught up
[1:52:48] with them to meet the Lord
[1:52:50] in the
[1:52:55] air job said oh to be young
