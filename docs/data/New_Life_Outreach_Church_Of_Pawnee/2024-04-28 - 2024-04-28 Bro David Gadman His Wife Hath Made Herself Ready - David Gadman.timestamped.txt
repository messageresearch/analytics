[44:22] Esther the first chapter we want to look
[44:24] at the first or the 10th or through the
[44:27] 12th
[44:28] verse says on the seventh day when the
[44:32] heart of the King was married with wine
[44:34] he commanded and you see all there names
[44:36] there seven of them he said the seven
[44:39] chamberlains that served in the presence
[44:41] of russas the king to bring Vesti the
[44:46] the queen before the king with the Crown
[44:48] Royal to show the people and the
[44:51] princess her beauty sure for she was
[44:54] fair to look upon but the queen V I
[44:57] refused to come at the king's
[44:59] commandment by his chamberlains
[45:01] therefore was the king very wroth and
[45:03] his anger burned in him then drop down
[45:05] there to the 19th
[45:08] verse say if it please the king Let
[45:11] There Go a royal commandment from him
[45:13] and let it be written among the laws of
[45:15] the Persians and the mes that it be not
[45:18] altered that vesi come no more before
[45:21] the king arus and let the King give her
[45:24] Royal Estate unto another that is is
[45:27] better than she may the Lord add His
[45:29] blessings to the reading of the word you
[45:31] may be
[45:32] seated if you want to look over in
[45:34] Revelations the 19th Chapter don't have
[45:37] to turn there but I'm sure I'll put it
[45:38] up on screen and right the seventh verse
[45:41] here's what I want to draw my thoughts
[45:43] from this morning amen it said verse
[45:46] Revelations 19:7 it says let us be glad
[45:49] and
[45:50] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[45:54] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[45:56] wife
[45:57] has made herself ready like to speak on
[46:01] that this morning his wife hath made
[46:03] herself ready his wife hath made herself
[46:07] ready now I was thinking and and then
[46:09] along these lines and just and just
[46:11] thinking about uh this this and I was
[46:14] thinking about it here the other day and
[46:16] just I spoke on it back home at the
[46:17] church uh the last time I spoke there
[46:20] and I guess is this my water right here
[46:21] in this cup
[46:25] amen I'm than about everything that's
[46:27] going on with uh with uh Israel and
[46:29] different things and just uh you know
[46:32] how it is and and people giving up in
[46:33] the message and quitting and leaving and
[46:35] and all these things and just just seems
[46:38] like you know everything that's going on

[46:42] just see you turn here and there's this
[46:44] person needs prayer you turn here this

[46:47] just seems like everybody's going
[46:49] through something anymore I mean just
[46:52] you know you heard the old expression
[46:54] when it it seems like when it rains it
[46:55] pours and surely everybody's going

[47:02] made herself ready now see I can't make

[49:51] to gain to lose
[49:56] he said brother I got to preach like I'm
[49:58] a dying person preaching to a dying
[50:02] congregation I made it up in my mind
[50:05] several months back I don't care if it
[50:07] hair lips the devil or not I'm going to

[50:15] my hands to worship him for what he has
[50:19] done for
[50:21] me has he been good to
[50:23] you now let me read you a couple things
[50:25] the prophet said is that all
[50:28] right God keeps his
[50:30] word
[50:32] 1957 now said now if you'll notice he
[50:35] said as it was in the days of
[50:38] Noah in the days of Noah Before the
[50:41] Flood how it would be and God was not
[50:44] willing that any should perish he's
[50:46] still not willing that any of us should
[50:47] perish this morning he don't want to see
[50:50] none of us lost but you know what
[50:53] there's going to be somebody that's lost
[50:57] there's going to be somebody that's
[50:58] saved there's going to be somebody that
[51:00] takes a Rapture there's somebody's going
[51:03] to take get out of here and a body
[51:04] change amen so he left it up to me so I
[51:08] got he said here he didn't say hey the
[51:10] preacher has made you ready he said his
[51:12] wife has made herself ready amen so hey
[51:16] the preacher hey the preacher just
[51:17] preaches it it's up to me to make myself
[51:20] ready Hallelujah now he says and God was
[51:23] not willing that any should perish but
[51:25] that all should come in their repentance
[51:27] God help us this morning then then he
[51:30] suffered
[51:31] long the flood stage was past
[51:34] due down in Egypt it was way past due he
[51:38] said do you get it in the anti thean
[51:41] destruction now way past due the
[51:45] destruction and judgment was Co and
[51:47] coming out of Egypt was way past due you
[51:49] know brother Brown said one place he
[51:51] said the Rapture was
[51:54] overdue help me Lord
[51:57] Amen Let Me God if I need to unpack let
[51:59] me unpack let me unpack my attitude my
[52:02] rotten attitude let me unpack anything
[52:04] that's not like you Lord so I'll be
[52:06] ready to get out of
[52:08] here he said 40 years over time but God
[52:12] was determined God was determined that
[52:15] his word would not return to him he's
[52:17] still determined today that is the Bible
[52:20] says that when his word goes out it
[52:22] won't go out and it won't return back to
[52:23] him void for to go out and do what what
[52:26] it is purpose to do this morning
[52:28] whatever it's purpose to do this morning
[52:30] it'll do that it ain't going to return
[52:32] back void I I hope if it's here this
[52:34] morning to uplift somebody it'll do that
[52:37] if it's here this morning to correct
[52:39] somebody it'll do that whatever the word
[52:42] is called to do this
[52:44] morning that's what he to do he said
[52:47] it's not willing amen he he was
[52:50] determined that his word would not
[52:52] return he made a promise is that right
[52:55] oh Hallelujah alah he made a promise to
[52:58] us this morning you know the Bible you
[53:00] said there's a lot of people slipping
[53:01] away this one died and this one died but
[53:04] you know God said in his word that
[53:07] there's going to be some that are alive
[53:08] and remain amen that scripture ain't
[53:10] going to go unfulfilled whether it's me
[53:13] or you there's going to be somebody
[53:14] that's alive and remain waiting for the
[53:17] catching way of the Lord amen I
[53:20] determined say Lord let me be a part of
[53:22] that group but if I ain't let me be
[53:23] ready Lord either way Lord let me be be
[53:27] ready so he says it says he's not
[53:30] determined that his word would he's
[53:32] determined that his word will not return
[53:33] to him he's going to keep his word he
[53:36] has to keep his word he must do it in
[53:38] order to be
[53:40] God think about that if he has to make a
[53:44] change of everything and by Grace he
[53:46] will do it that's the reason I say if
[53:48] the church does not get herself ready he
[53:51] said he said that's your duty to get
[53:53] ready the bride has made herself ready
[53:56] the guard garments is paid for they are
[53:58] ready but you must be ready to wear
[54:00] those garments I wonder this morning if
[54:01] we can say that we're ready to wear
[54:03] those garments this morning oh and we
[54:06] don't cut the Garment to fit us we cut
[54:09] ourselves to fit the Garment amen Elijah
[54:12] didn't cut Elisha didn't cut himself
[54:13] down to fit Elijah's uh cut the Garment
[54:16] Elijah's Manel to fit himself he had to
[54:19] cut himself down to fit the manle God
[54:21] help us this morning to cut oursel down
[54:24] to fit the word of God
[54:27] Hallelujah he said the go they're ready
[54:29] but you must be ready the church has
[54:31] made herself ready you believe that this
[54:35] morning again he

[55:05] message from the pull pit it takes you
[55:07] to get ready it takes your life in

[59:35] Bible it was joh uh Peter and John when
[59:38] they was going down to the temple for it
[59:39] was the third hour the day going on the
[59:43] nth hour day going down there to pray
[59:46] and this man that been begging arms sit
[59:49] around there maybe he was there in the
[59:52] when Jesus walked the shorts again I
[59:54] don't know but there he was was cuz he
[59:56] said been crippled from his
[59:59] birth and when he got up there he held

[1:00:28] youth stood up and started walking went
[1:00:30] in the temple leaping and praising God
[1:00:32] and the Bible said when they begin to
[1:00:34] question Peter and John and they had to
[1:00:36] take note that Peter and John had been
[1:00:38] with Jesus why because they were
[1:00:40] producing Christ in their lives what
[1:00:42] about us this
[1:00:45] morning what they say about me and you
[1:00:48] when they come around

[1:01:33] indifferent or can you speak of the
[1:01:36] peace and the love that you have found
[1:01:38] in Christ she has made herself ready now
[1:01:42] my theme for this morning is Esther so
[1:01:44] let's just look at this for a little can
[1:01:46] we try not to hold you too long my wife
[1:01:49] ain't would like that yet so in in in
[1:01:51] Esther the first chapter we read said on
[1:01:53] the seventh day he begin to call he
[1:01:55] begin to call his men together the seven
[1:01:58] chamblin can you imagine look at that
[1:02:00] seven we had seven Church ages and and
[1:02:03] that serveing the presence of the king
[1:02:05] to bring vasti the queen before the king
[1:02:08] with a crown wall to show the people and
[1:02:10] the princesses are Beauty for she was
[1:02:12] fair to look on but the queen vasti
[1:02:15] refused I thought oh God I thought about
[1:02:17] that and I thought my here it was how
[1:02:19] the king had invited his wife cuz she
[1:02:22] was fair to look upon amen so he she
[1:02:25] invit she he invited her to come and set
[1:02:28] by his side cuz he wanted to display her
[1:02:31] amen wanted to show her off but you know
[1:02:33] what it said there that the king that
[1:02:35] the queen refused oh God help us this
[1:02:38] morning amen we've been invited me and
[1:02:40] you have this morning have been invited
[1:02:42] to mold and shape our character like his
[1:02:46] we've been invited to do that since we
[1:02:48] but you know what it depends on
[1:02:50] sometimes the
[1:02:51] invitation whether we want to go or not
[1:02:54] how many's ever been invited to
[1:02:56] something maybe you've got an invitation
[1:02:58] in the mail a wedding or something and
[1:03:00] it just depends sometimes on who sent
[1:03:02] the invitation whether you say oh look
[1:03:03] at that I ain't going throw it in the
[1:03:05] trash cuz the person that invited
[1:03:08] you all right or maybe because the way

[1:31:32] ready she laid aside all these things
[1:31:35] she was accepted the rest were rejected
[1:31:38] brother Brandon says like this the same
[1:31:41] on marriage of the Lamb he said the same
[1:31:43] way it is about Divine Healing God's got
[1:31:45] the power to heal you if you got the
[1:31:46] courage to accept it but you'll fight
[1:31:48] every inch of the way God's got Amazing
[1:31:51] Grace to save you and he will do it but
[1:31:52] you fight every inch of the way I've
[1:31:54] been behind this pull bit going on 31
[1:31:56] years and every inch of that has been a
[1:31:58] fight constantly it certainly has but we
[1:32:01] got to fight if we must rain so we must
[1:32:03] find that the bride has made herself
[1:32:05] ready be be willing to lay aside every
[1:32:08] weight that does so easily beset us that
[1:32:10] we might run with patience that race
[1:32:12] that is set before us we must keep them
[1:32:15] uh uh we must lay them aside ourself we
[1:32:18] can't say God you come lay them aside
[1:32:20] for us we must do that
[1:32:22] ourselves that's do it ourselves then
[1:32:25] say God help me whatever it takes
[1:32:28] Lord let me light
[1:32:30] everything she she was accepted and the
[1:32:33] rest of the women was rejected because
[1:32:35] she was willing to lay everything aside
[1:32:38] what about me and you if we're born
[1:32:41] again this morning willing to lay
[1:32:43] everything inside that we are be chosen
[1:32:46] the
[1:32:47] others they'll be rejected BR said it
[1:32:50] like this
[1:32:51] 1960 Revelations chapter 4 po Charlie

[1:47:34] Father oh God with my heart turning
[1:47:35] around and around it seems knowing that
[1:47:38] you're here see you move out over this
[1:47:40] audience in a form of a Big Bright Light
[1:47:43] speaking Visions breaking forth knowing
[1:47:45] that the time is at hand right now soon
[1:47:48] you shall send Jesus again and he will
[1:47:49] come to this earth no man knoweth the
[1:47:51] minute or hour not even even the angels
[1:47:53] but the father only and here he comes to
[1:47:56] the Earth again time way past due like
[1:47:59] it was in the days of Noah the long
[1:48:00] suffering when the ark was being
[1:48:02] prepared wherein seven Souls were saved
[1:48:04] or eight now today his coming is way
[1:48:07] past due way overdue should have been
[1:48:09] here a long time ago but God's not
[1:48:11] willing that any should perish but that
[1:48:13] all might come to
[1:48:17] repentance it was a few weeks back maybe
[1:48:20] even a month or more now I was
[1:48:22] ministering and I was talking about the
[1:48:25] woman that had lost her coin and she had
[1:48:27] to sweep the house to find it and
[1:48:30] talking about how that those coins were
[1:48:33] actually part of a uh a piece of jewelry
[1:48:35] that she would wear and it was normally
[1:48:38] given to the bride before the wedding it
[1:48:41] was one of the first wedding gifts that
[1:48:42] she got and when you look up the history
[1:48:45] about it that says that whenever she
[1:48:47] would be having time where she was
[1:48:49] thinking about the groom she was
[1:48:51] supposed to be ising those coins and so
[1:48:55] when the wedding day came the more shiny
[1:48:58] the more that was recognized that she
[1:49:00] had been thinking about her groom she
[1:49:02] had been thinking about the one that was
[1:49:04] coming and brother ROM talked about how
[1:49:07] those coins are the different fruits of
[1:49:09] the spirit that we have in our life and
[1:49:12] are we going through and polishing those
[1:49:15] things when Brother David was talking
[1:49:17] about are we the bride hath made herself
[1:49:21] ready how are we spending all of our
[1:49:24] time doing those are we are we in that
[1:49:26] place where our heart is continually
[1:49:29] thinking towards the groom and that
[1:49:32] that's where our desire is that's where
[1:49:33] our focus is we know we live in a world
[1:49:36] where we have to go to work and we have
[1:49:38] to provide we have to go and do this we
[1:49:40] have to go and do that but is our desire
[1:49:43] continually going we just want the groom
[1:49:47] to be here we just want to be with him
[1:49:49] we just want to be in his presence
[1:49:54] I can think back to before my wife and I
[1:49:57] were married when we would be calling
[1:49:59] each other every evening
[1:50:01] and sometimes we didn't even have
[1:50:03] anything to say sometimes there wasn't a
[1:50:04] whole lot to say other than say over and
[1:50:06] over I miss you I miss
[1:50:09] you people would have laughed if they
[1:50:11] had been listening to conversations
[1:50:12] because we would just be saying that
[1:50:13] kind of over and over to each other
[1:50:15] other times we'd have good conversations
[1:50:18] but that desire to just be she was in
[1:50:21] one state I was in another and all we
[1:50:23] wanted to do was just to be
[1:50:28] together but yet it's so easy for us to
[1:50:30] get distracted from that even
[1:50:35] today 19 years later my wife still hates
[1:50:41] the game of
[1:50:42] Monopoly because I got together with the
[1:50:45] youth one night during the time we were
[1:50:47] engaged and we got wrapped up in a game
[1:50:49] of Monopoly and I didn't call her that
[1:50:52] night because I was so busy spending
[1:50:54] time with youth and playing this game of
[1:50:55] Monopoly and even today my wife will say
[1:50:58] she hates the game of
[1:51:00] Monopoly because it distracted me from
[1:51:02] her it distracted me from paying
[1:51:05] attention to her at that
[1:51:08] time and when we're when the scriptures
[1:51:11] say the bride hath made herself ready we
[1:51:14] have to throw aside those distractions
[1:51:16] we have to throw aside those games of
[1:51:19] Monopoly that are in our life that they
[1:51:20] may not even the things that they may
[1:51:22] not be wrong there's nothing wrong with
[1:51:24] playing a game of Monopoly there's
[1:51:26] nothing wrong with doing this or doing
[1:51:29] that but even Beyond cleaning the sin
[1:51:31] cleaning out those distractions that
[1:51:34] make us think about other things around
[1:51:36] us that make us get wrapped up in other
[1:51:40] things when God is wanting the focus to
[1:51:43] be completely on him the bride hath made
[1:51:47] herself ready she have polished
[1:51:49] everything up just right she's clothed
[1:51:51] herself in the right garment she
[1:51:52] prepared
[1:51:55] herself to be just what God wants her to
[1:52:02] be that's the place that we're at and
[1:52:05] that's the place that we have to keep
[1:52:07] ourselves being from being distracted
[1:52:09] from I thought that was a really good
[1:52:11] service this morning I really enjoyed

[1:52:25] bit of rest this afternoon to be ready
