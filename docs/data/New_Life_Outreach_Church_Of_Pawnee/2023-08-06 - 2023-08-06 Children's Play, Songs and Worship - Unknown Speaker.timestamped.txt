[5:12] every year Jesus parents traveled to
[5:15] Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover
[5:16] when he was 12 years old they went up as
[5:19] they always did for the feast when it
[5:21] was over they left for home but the
[5:23] Child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem
[5:25] with without his parents knowing
[5:27] thinking he was somewhere in the Caravan
[5:29] they journeyed for a whole day and began
[5:31] looking for him among relatives and
[5:33] Neighbors
[5:34] when they didn't find him they went back
[5:36] to Jerusalem looking for him the next
[5:38] day they found him in the temple seated
[5:39] among the teachers listening to them and
[5:42] asking questions the teachers were all
[5:44] quite taken with him impressed with the
[5:46] sharpness of his answers
[5:59] [Music]
[6:01] why you stopped me I posted about my
[6:04] father's business
[6:06] so he went back to Nazareth with them
[6:08] and lived obediently with him his mother
[6:10] held these things dearly deep within
[6:12] herself and Jesus matured growing up
[6:14] both in body and spirit blessed by both

[7:17] dressed in a camel hair and lived on a
[7:19] diet of locus and Wild Honey people
[7:22] poured out of Jerusalem Judea and the
[7:24] Jordanian Countryside to hear and see
[7:26] him in action
[7:27] there at the Jordan River those who came
[7:29] to confess their sins were baptized when
[7:31] John saw the Pharisees and Sadducees
[7:33] coming to the baptism he had to speak
[7:36] out
[7:37] old Generation of Vipers who have warned
[7:40] you of giraffe to come
[7:43] whatever
[7:44] um
[7:45] I think not to say within yourselves we
[7:47] are sons of Abraham for I stand to you
[7:49] everyone is able to rise up to himself
[7:51] Children of the rocks and someone is
[7:53] coming greater than I who feels I am not
[7:55] worthy to bear and he will burn up all
[7:59] the chat from his Gardener with an
[8:00] unconscionable fire
[8:01] then Jesus came arriving at the Jordan
[8:03] River From Galilee to be baptized by
[8:06] John when John saw him there he couldn't
[8:08] understand it I have need to be baptized
[8:10] of thee come inside to me so forth to be
[8:13] so we must fulfill our righteousness the
[8:16] moment Jesus came up out of the
[8:18] baptismal Waters the skies opened up and
[8:21] he saw God's spirit descending like a
[8:22] dove and landing on him and along with
[8:25] the spirit of voice this is my beloved
[8:28] Son in who I am pleased to dwell

[9:59] Jesus was led to the spirit Into the
[10:01] Wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[10:03] after fasting for 40 days and fourth
[10:05] nights he became hungry it was during
[10:08] this time of physical weakness that the
[10:10] temperature came to him
[10:12] if you truly are the Son of God then
[10:14] turn these stones into bread
[10:16] it's written man should not live by
[10:18] bread alone but every word that
[10:19] proceedeth out of the mouth of God then
[10:22] the devil took him up to Jerusalem and
[10:23] set him on the Pinnacle of the temple
[10:25] the Pinnacle was 164 feet up
[10:28] approximately 15 stories high from this
[10:31] great height the devil tempted him again
[10:34] if you're the Son of God then throw
[10:36] yourself down for it is written that he
[10:38] has given his angels charge over you and
[10:40] in their hands they shall bear you up
[10:41] lest you dash your foot against a stone
[10:44] it is also written Thou shalt not tempt
[10:46] the Lord
[10:48] and the devil took Jesus up into an
[10:50] exceeding high mountain well on the
[10:52] mountain he showed Jesus all the kings
[10:54] of the world throughout time he showed
[10:56] Jesus the glory and the power in of
[10:58] wealth of each kingdom
[11:00] Fall Down and Worship me and I will give
[11:02] you all these things
[11:04] insane for that show worship Lord thy
[11:07] God and whom only shout that serve Jesus

[13:27] while Jesus was teaching there came a
[13:30] man named Jairus and he was a ruler of
[13:32] the synagogue Jairus fell down at Jesus
[13:35] feet and begged him to come to his house
[13:37] his only daughter a little 12 year old
[13:39] girl was dying Jesus agreed to go but
[13:42] all the people wanted to hear more of
[13:43] his sermon so they crowded around him
[13:45] and jostled at each other as they walked
[13:47] along the road
[13:50] just then a woman who had hemorrhaged
[13:53] for 12 years fought through the crowd
[13:55] she was thinking that if she could just
[13:57] Touch the Hem of His Garment she would
[13:59] be healed sought who touched me
[14:03] you can shove it why do you ask who
[14:05] touched you no this is different I can
[14:06] tell someone touched me because my
[14:08] strength has gone out of me

[14:15] clean daughter be of good Comfort your
[14:18] faith has made you whole
[14:21] Harris
[14:25] if you're not only believe in her faith
[14:28] will make her whole
[14:29] Jesus commanded that the multitude of
[14:31] people as well as most of his disciples
[14:33] should go home he only allowed Peter
[14:36] James and John to go with him to
[14:37] jairus's house
[14:39] as I walked into the house they found a
[14:41] small gathering of mourners everyone was
[14:43] weeping and crying over the girl's death
[14:46] why are you crying so loudly this damsel
[14:48] is not dead but is simply asleep
[14:49] for a moment the mourners just stared at
[14:52] Jesus but then they began to laugh who's
[14:54] this man that would come and tell them a
[14:56] dead girl wasn't only asleep what did he
[14:59] know about the situation
[15:01] Jesus commanded them all to leave to how
[15:03] to leave the house and they were gone he
[15:06] went into the room with the girl
[15:09] and her parents alone
[15:11] damsel I say unto thee arise
[15:15] at Jesus words the damsel Rose and
[15:17] walked to her parents they were shocked
[15:19] and excited all at the same time Jesus
[15:22] immediately commanded that they should
[15:23] get the girl something to eat and they
[15:25] should tell no man what happened in the
[15:27] room

[17:11] soon another Feast came around and Jesus
[17:14] back in Jerusalem near the Sheep gate in
[17:16] Jerusalem there was a pool with five
[17:18] alcoves in Hebrew it is called Bethesda
[17:21] hundreds of six sick people blind
[17:23] crippled and paralyzed were in these
[17:25] alcoves when Jesus came to the pool he
[17:28] walked through the crowd and single that
[17:29] one man this man had been had been an
[17:32] invalid for 38 years
[17:35] you're going to be healed

[17:43] up your bed and walk the man was
[17:46] instantly healed he climbed up to his
[17:48] feet and walked away with much rejoicing
[17:50] but as he went some of the Jews stopped
[17:52] him to berate and correct him
[17:54] it is the Sabbath why do you carry your
[17:56] bed that is against the law the man who
[17:58] hit me said take my bed and start
[18:00] walking who gave you the order to take
[18:02] up your bed and start walking
[18:03] who's right here man
[18:06] but I don't know
[18:08] later the same day Jesus encountered the
[18:11] man he had healed at the temple he
[18:12] instructed the man to sin no more so
[18:14] that a worse thing did not come upon him
[18:16] after the conversation the man went and
[18:19] told the Jews it was Jesus that had made
[18:20] him whole

[19:39] [Music]
[20:06] after a big day of preaching and feeding
[20:08] five thousand men plus women and
[20:10] children Jesus insisted that the
[20:12] disciples get in the boat and go
[20:13] underneath
[20:15] while he dismissed the people with the
[20:18] crowd dispersed he climbed the mountain
[20:20] so he could be by himself and pray he
[20:23] stayed there alone laid into the night
[20:24] meanwhile in the boat that was far out
[20:27] at Sea when the wind came up against
[20:29] them and they were battered by the waves
[20:35] no matter how hard the disciples rode
[20:37] they couldn't make any progress it was
[20:40] about four o'clock in the morning when
[20:41] one of them saw something they could
[20:43] just make out a shadowy figure through
[20:45] the wind and waves and dim light
[20:48] look it's a
[20:57] it's a it is I don't be afraid
[21:00] if it's you call me to come to you
[21:06] Peter jumped out of the boat and began
[21:07] to walk to Jesus he took several steps
[21:10] without any problem but as the wind and
[21:12] waves splashed against him he began to
[21:13] look at what was taking place around him
[21:15] the waves churning beneath his feet as
[21:18] the wind blowing against him raised
[21:20] doubts in his mind and began to sink
[21:23] not save me Jesus reached out and
[21:27] grabbed Peter's hand lifting him back up
[21:29] but he admonished his disciple oh now a
[21:32] little faith why did stealth out
[21:34] the two walked across the water and they
[21:36] climbed the number as soon as they
[21:37] climbed into the boat the wind died and
[21:39] seas calm the disciples in the boat
[21:42] having watched the whole thing began to
[21:43] worship Jesus saying
[21:45] [Music]
[21:54] [Applause]
[22:02] oh
[22:03] [Music]
[22:46] thank you
[22:51] [Music]
[23:17] thank you
[23:19] as Jesus was walking down the street in
[23:21] Jerusalem he and his disciples saw a man
[23:23] that had been born blind
[23:27] cause this man to be born blind him or
[23:29] his parents neither this man or his
[23:32] parents sin to cause him to be born
[23:33] blind it was born this way for the works
[23:36] of God could be manifested when Jesus
[23:38] stopped speaking he began to spin into
[23:40] the dust once there was enough moisture
[23:42] collected he made a clay paste and then
[23:44] rubbed it into the Blind Man's eyes
[23:48] go on wash in the pool of Slum the man
[23:51] followed Jesus instructions and made his
[23:52] way to the pool of Siloam once there he
[23:55] washed the pace from his eyes and his
[23:57] eyes were open he could see soon the
[24:00] town was buzzing with his relatives and
[24:01] those who had seen him begging as a
[24:03] blind man year after year were all
[24:05] asking isn't this the man we knew who
[24:07] sat here and begged
[24:11] his arm
[24:12] it's not the same man
[24:15] no it's definitely me don't you
[24:17] recognize me
[24:21] a man named Jesus made a paste and
[24:24] rubbed it in my eyes he told me to come
[24:25] wash in this pool and whenever I did I
[24:27] could see
[24:28] so where is he
[24:30] I don't know
[24:32] the crowd took hold of the man and
[24:34] marched him to the Pharisees once there
[24:36] the Pharisees questioned him again about
[24:38] what he had seen the men continued to
[24:40] share the exact same story but it didn't
[24:42] satisfy the Pharisees
[24:44] this man can't be from God he doesn't
[24:46] keep the Sabbath how can a man that such
[24:49] a sinner do such a miracle
[24:51] what about you what do you think of the
[24:53] man that healed you I think he's a
[24:55] prophet the Pharisees didn't believe it
[24:57] they didn't even believe the man had
[24:59] been blind to begin with they decided
[25:01] that they needed to get more information
[25:02] so they called in the Man's parents
[25:06] is this your son was he actually born
[25:08] blind and if so how does he now see
[25:17] he speak for himself
[25:19] give credit to God we know that this man
[25:22] is a sinner
[25:23] I don't know anything about him being a
[25:25] sinner all I know is I was blind and now
[25:27] I see but how did he open your eyes I've
[25:29] told you the story over and over again
[25:31] if I told you again would you believe me
[25:33] you may be a disciple of that man but we
[25:35] are Disciples of Moses we know that
[25:37] Moses was a prophet but we have no idea
[25:39] where this man came from
[25:41] so we know that God only listens to
[25:44] people that do and obey his will so if
[25:46] he was a sinner could he really do
[25:47] anything how dare you you were born in
[25:49] sins and dare to teach us
[25:51] the Pharisees took hold of the man very
[25:53] roughly and threw him into the street he
[25:55] was left to wander through the crowds
[25:57] not sure where to go or what to do but
[25:59] then Jesus found him
[26:08] do you believe in the son of man yes
[26:11] shown to me shown to me that I may
[26:13] believe in him
[26:18] Lord I believe
[26:21] thank you

[28:51] Jesus was traveling toward Jerusalem
[28:53] when he crossed over the border from
[28:54] Samaria and Galilee as he was
[28:56] approaching a village he was met by ten
[28:58] lepers the men kept their distance as
[29:01] was the law but they called out loudly
[29:03] to get his attention
[29:11] at Jesus command the Ten Men began to
[29:14] make their way to the priests as they
[29:16] walked they were everyone healed
[29:18] they were all very excited and all
[29:19] continued their way but one of them who
[29:22] happened to be a Samaritan turned around
[29:23] and made his way back to Jesus

[32:00] as Jesus was in the wilderness teaching
[32:02] a messenger came to him Master the only
[32:05] one you love is sick
[32:06] Jesus knew that this was a message
[32:08] concerning his good good friend Lazarus
[32:10] of Bethany
[32:12] the sickness is known to death but that
[32:14] the glory of God might be shown through
[32:16] the Son of God Jesus loved Lazarus and
[32:19] his sister Mary and Martha but instead
[32:21] of leaving as soon as he received the
[32:23] message he remained in the wilderness
[32:24] for another two days finally after two
[32:27] days of teaching he called his disciples
[32:29] to him
[32:30] let's go back to Judea you can't go back
[32:34] to the jail the Jews are out to kill you
[32:37] whoever walks in the daylight doesn't
[32:38] stumble because you can see where he's
[32:40] going meanwhile whoever walks in the
[32:42] night can't see where he's going so he
[32:43] will stumble my our friend Lazarus has
[32:46] fallen asleep and I'm going to wake him
[32:47] up if he's fall asleep he'll get a good
[32:50] night's rest and you woke up feeling
[32:51] fine Lazarus has died and I'm glad for
[32:54] your sakes I wasn't there but the intent
[32:56] that this will strengthen your faith
[32:58] let's go we might die with him when
[33:01] Jesus finally got there he found Lazarus
[33:03] already four days dead Bethany was near
[33:06] Jerusalem only a couple of miles away
[33:08] and many of the Jews are visiting Mary
[33:09] and Martha sympathizing with him over
[33:12] their brother when Martha heard Jesus
[33:14] was coming she rushed out to meet him
[33:22] in there my brother wouldn't have died
[33:24] but even now I know whatever you ask God
[33:26] he will give you
[33:27] your brother will live again
[33:29] I believe that he will rise again in the
[33:31] resurrection at the last day
[33:33] I am the resurrection and life whosoever
[33:36] believeth in me even though they die
[33:38] will live again do you believe this yes
[33:40] master I believe that you the Messiah
[33:42] Son of God who comes into the world
[33:44] after saying this Martha went back to
[33:46] her sister Mary after Martha whispered
[33:49] to her that Jesus had arrived and was
[33:50] asking for her Mary jumped up and ran
[33:53] out to meet him Jesus had not yet
[33:55] entered the town but had remained at the
[33:56] place where Martha met him when her
[33:59] sympathizing Jewish friend saw Murray
[34:01] runoff they followed her thinking she
[34:02] was on her way to the tomb to weep there
[34:09] [Music]
[34:10] when Jesus saw Mary sobbing and the Jews
[34:13] with her he felt a great sorrow rise up
[34:15] within him asking where they had laid
[34:17] Lazarus to rest Jesus also began to weep
[34:20] as they were walking to the gravesite
[34:22] some of the Jews observed How Deeply
[34:24] Jesus must have loved Lazarus While
[34:26] others asked why Jesus hadn't done more
[34:28] to prevent the death of Lazarus
[34:30] remove the stone
[34:34] Lord by this time he stinketh it's been
[34:36] four days didn't I tell you that if you
[34:38] believed you would see the glory of God
[34:40] I say unto you remove the stone
[34:44] father I thank thee that thou has hurt
[34:46] me and I know that that will always
[34:47] hears me but because of but because of
[34:49] those around me I saith it Lazarus come
[34:52] forth at Jesus words he came out of the
[34:55] Tomb a walking cativer
[34:58] wrapped from head to toe and with
[35:00] kerchief over his face he was alive but

[1:29:37] I hurried through the window looked down
[1:29:40] into the street
[1:29:42] expecting swords and torches and the
[1:29:46] sound of soldiers being
[1:29:49] there was no one there but Mary
[1:29:52] soap it down the lettering
[1:29:56] stood there beside me she told us where
[1:30:00] she'd been she said they've moved them
[1:30:03] in the middle of the night and none of
[1:30:06] us knows where
[1:30:08] stoned and rolled away now his body
[1:30:12] isn't there
[1:30:15] we both ran toward a garden
[1:30:18] John ran on the head
[1:30:21] we found a stone in the empty tomb just
[1:30:24] the way that Mary said but the winding
[1:30:28] sheet they wrapped him in was just an
[1:30:31] empty shell
[1:30:33] how where they'd taken him was more than
[1:30:37] I could tell
[1:30:40] something strange happened there
[1:30:43] was what I did not know
[1:30:46] John believed a miracle
[1:30:49] but I just turned to go
[1:30:51] circumstances speculations
[1:30:55] could lift me very high
[1:30:58] I'd seen them crucify him
[1:31:01] then I saw him down
[1:31:05] back inside the house again
[1:31:12] everything God promised him just added
[1:31:16] to my shame when elastic came with
[1:31:19] choices I denied I knew his name
[1:31:23] even if he wasn't alive
[1:31:26] it wouldn't be the same
[1:31:30] suddenly the arrows filled with a
[1:31:34] strange and sweet perfume
[1:31:36] and I've shown them everywhere drove
[1:31:39] Shadows from the room
[1:31:41] Jesus stood before me with his arms held
[1:31:45] open wide I fell down on my knees I
[1:31:50] clothed him and cried
[1:31:53] he raised me to my feet
[1:31:56] I looked into his eyes
[1:31:59] and I was shining out from them like
[1:32:01] sunlight from the skies
[1:32:04] guilt in my confusion
[1:32:07] disappeared and sweet release
[1:32:10] every fear I'd ever had was melted into
[1:32:14] peas
[1:32:17] he's alive
[1:32:19] he's alive
[1:32:22] he's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's
[1:32:26] gates are open wide he's alive
[1:32:30] he's alive

[1:41:46] do you enjoy that your mind made up
[1:41:48] tonight
[1:41:50] well anybody else
[1:42:09] um
[1:42:22] brother Harry's first time playing and
[1:42:25] singing
[1:42:33] students in the guitar class
[1:42:35] just bragging a little bit on our class
[1:42:59] it's always been a challenge having
[1:43:01] where I would get asked to sing and then
[1:43:04] if I didn't play myself trying to either
[1:43:07] sing normally acapella or uh
[1:43:12] having everybody try to pick out the
[1:43:14] song so
[1:43:16] forgive me you've listened to the the
[1:43:18] expert guitar players now you get the
[1:43:20] the beginner but
[1:43:27] then
[1:43:29] that's it Simon so foolishly wise
[1:43:34] proudly he's tending his neck
[1:43:38] s
[1:43:39] then Jesus calls and the boats Drift
[1:43:43] Away
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:43:49] more than the Nazi abandoned that day he
[1:43:55] found that his pride was soon drifting
[1:43:58] away and it's hard to imagine the
[1:44:02] freedom we find from the things that we
[1:44:06] leave behind
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:12] you was mindful of taking the time
[1:44:16] attacks and pressing the people to pay
[1:44:21] but hearing the call he responded in
[1:44:26] faith and followed the light and the way
[1:44:31] and leaving the people so puzzled he
[1:44:36] found the breed in his heart was no
[1:44:40] longer around and it's hard to imagine
[1:44:43] the freedom we find from the things that
[1:44:48] we leave behind
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:54] every heart needs to be set free from
[1:44:58] possession that hold its own tight
[1:45:04] Freedom's not found in the things that
[1:45:07] we own
[1:45:10] it's the power to do what is right
[1:45:15] with Jesus our only possession
[1:45:20] then giving me comes a delight and we
[1:45:26] can imagine the freedom we find from the
[1:45:32] things that we leave behind
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:44] worshiping Goods we possess but Jesus
[1:45:49] says Lay All Your Treasures aside and
[1:45:53] love God above all the rest fast cause
[1:45:58] when we say no to the things of the
[1:46:02] world we open our hearts to the love of
[1:46:06] the Lord and it's hard to imagine the
[1:46:10] freedom we find from the things that we
[1:46:15] leave behind
[1:46:18] oh and it's hard to imagine the freedom
[1:46:23] we find from the things that we leave
[1:46:27] behind
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:36] oh man that was good that was that
[1:46:40] wasn't an easy song either a lot of
