[35:22] When my soul
[35:25] was so dry
[35:29] and I need to drink
[35:33] [music]
[35:34] the waters
[35:36] of life
[35:39] you became to [singing and music] me.

[36:31] cruise of oil
[36:36] and all Elijah's meat.

[36:42] for brother Noah.

[40:02] from every fear.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Those who look on him

[43:58] forever. [singing]
[44:06] Sorry guys.
[44:08] Let's try that first verse again.
[44:11] I [singing and music] sought the Lord
[44:15] and he answered me
[44:18] and delivered me
[44:22] from [music and singing] every fear. As
[44:24] the man of God gets ready to come out,
[44:26] look on him
[44:29] are radant. [music and singing]
[44:32] They'll never be ashamed.
[44:36] You'll never be [music] ashamed.
[44:39] This poor man cried
[44:43] and the Lord heard [singing] me
[44:46] and saved me from
[44:49] my [music and singing] eneies.
[44:53] The son of God
[44:57] surrounds his [music and singing] saint.
[45:00] He will deliver them.
[45:03] He will [music and singing] deliver
[45:04] them.
[45:07] Heat. Heat.
[45:11] [music]
[45:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[45:28] [music]
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Ever magnify [music]
[45:36] the Lord [singing]

[45:41] Come exalt [singing] his [music] name

[45:50] the Lord [singing]
[45:52] with me.
[45:54] Come exalt [singing]
[45:57] his name
[45:58] forever.
[46:04] Amen. Is that what you've come to do
[46:06] tonight? [applause]
[46:08] Amen. Can we sing that song? The more
[46:11] that I surrender, the lighter my load.
[46:12] I'm not sure the key. Maybe you have.
[46:15] The more that [singing] I surrender,
[46:19] the lighter my load.
[46:23] And the more that I release my car, the
[46:27] more [singing and music] you take
[46:29] control,
[46:31] the more that I can humble
[46:34] [singing and music] myself, the more you
[46:36] lift me up. Every day I
[46:40] [music and singing] live, Lord, I love
[46:42] you more. Can we do a verse now? It gets
[46:46] easier to understand [singing]
[46:50] this road. I'm traveling down. No more
[46:54] wavering or wondering.
[46:57] I'm standing on solid ground. And I know
[47:02] I'm headed for my future home. The voice
[47:06] I hear [music] is yours alone. Every day
[47:09] that I live, Lord, I love you
[47:12] [music and singing] more.
[47:15] Oh, the more that I [music and singing]
[47:18] surrender,
[47:20] the lighter my load,
[47:23] the more that I release my [music]
[47:26] cares. The more you take control,
[47:29] [singing]
[47:31] the more that I can humble myself, the
[47:35] more you lift me [singing and music] up.
[47:37] Every day I live. Lord, I love you more.
[47:45] Heavenly Father,
[47:47] that's our desire [music] tonight, Lord.
[47:51] So the more that we can let go of
[47:54] ourselves,
[47:56] Father, and submit to [music] your word,
[47:59] God, I'm asking tonight that you'll help
[48:02] me do so, Lord. Help us to get ourselves
[48:05] out of the way, Lord. Take any pride,
[48:10] anything, Father, that can be in our
[48:12] hearts that can prevent us from being
[48:15] fully submitted to your word. Lord, do
[48:17] [music] a heart check tonight.
[48:20] Father, may we all just have a a desire
[48:23] to get closer to you, Father. Help us to
[48:26] surrender, [music] Lord, our our
[48:28] everything, Lord, our wants, our
[48:31] desires, our motives and objectives,
[48:33] [music]
[48:34] Lord. And help us to rely on your word
[48:37] here tonight, Father. We love you, Lord.
[48:40] Just bless the reading of your word. In
[48:43] your [music] precious name, we pray.
[48:45] Amen. And amen. And if you have your
[48:47] Bibles tonight, I'd like to turn to John
[48:50] [music] 17 and verse 8. Like to say it's
[48:54] good to to see everyone here tonight.
[48:56] Amen. Appreciate Brother Caleb song
[48:59] leading.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Thought he did a good job. Amen.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. First John 17 and verse 8. We
[49:06] won't keep you too long here tonight.
[49:17] says, "For I have given unto them the
[49:19] words that thou hast gavest me, and they
[49:22] have received them, and have known
[49:24] surely that I came out from thee, and
[49:27] they have believed that thou didest sent
[49:29] me. I pray for them. I pray not for the
[49:33] world, but for them which thou hast
[49:35] given me, for they are thine, and all
[49:39] mine are thine, and thine are mine, and
[49:41] I am glorified in them.
[49:44] And now I am no more in the world, but
[49:46] these are in the world, and I come to
[49:49] thee, holy father,
[49:52] keep through thine own name those whom
[49:54] thou hast given me,
[49:57] that they may be one as we are. If we
[50:00] can jump down to verse 20
[50:03] says, "Neither pray I for these alone,
[50:06] but for them also which shall believe on
[50:09] me through their word,
[50:12] that they may all uh that they all may
[50:15] be one, as thou our father art in me,
[50:18] and I in thee, that they also may be one
[50:21] in us, that the world may believe that
[50:23] thou hast sent me. And the glory which
[50:26] thou gavest me, I have given them, that
[50:29] they may be one, even as we are one. I
[50:33] in them and thou in me, that they may be
[50:36] made perfect in one,
[50:39] &gt;&gt; that the world may know that thou hast
[50:40] sent me and has loved them as thou has
[50:44] loved me.
[50:46] Father, I will that they also whom thou
[50:49] has given me be with me where I am, that
[50:52] they may behold my glory which thou hast
[50:55] given me. For thou lovest me before the
[50:58] foundations of the world. Oh righteous
[51:01] father, the world hath not known thee,
[51:03] but I have known thee, and thou hast
[51:06] known thee that thou hast sent me. and I
[51:09] have declared unto them thy name and
[51:12] will declare it that the love wherewith
[51:14] thou hast loved me may be in them and I
[51:18] in them. May the Lord add his blessings
[51:21] to the reading of the word. If we could
[51:23] also turn, you may be seated tonight. Um
[51:25] turn to Colossians 1 and 27 and then 1
[51:29] Peter 5 and5 and then we'll get started
[51:31] here tonight.
[51:33] Colossians 1 and verse 27.
[51:43] says, "To whom God hath made known what
[51:46] is the richest riches of the glory of
[51:48] this mystery among the Gentiles,
[51:51] which is Christ in you, the hope of
[51:54] glory." And then one more passage of
[51:57] scripture, 1 Peter 5 and5.
[52:02] 1 Peter 5 and5. And tonight if we may
[52:04] take a little topic on [snorts] on
[52:07] submission here tonight if we can
[52:10] submission. First Peter 5 and5 it says
[52:13] likewise ye younger submit yourselves
[52:16] unto the elder. Yay all of you be
[52:19] subject one to another and be clothed
[52:21] with humility.
[52:23] For God resisteth the proud and giveth
[52:25] grace to the humble.
[52:28] Humble yourselves therefore under the
[52:30] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[52:34] in due time. So we see that there is a
[52:37] season for humility. Amen. And a season
[52:40] for submission.
[52:42] That is the sewing season. And then
[52:44] there is a harvest time with the Lord's
[52:47] help where we will be exalted in due
[52:49] time. So first submission then
[52:51] exaltation. Amen. Do you believe that
[52:53] tonight? And we see that Christ was
[52:55] first subjected to the will of the
[52:58] father. He became one with the father's
[53:00] will and then he was exalted to the
[53:03] right hand of God in heaven. Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; We begin to see since the fall of man in
[53:09] the garden of Eden. It seems that one of
[53:12] the hardest things for an individual to
[53:14] do is to submit themselves to a higher
[53:18] authority. Amen. But we find out that
[53:21] yet it is impossible for a person to
[53:24] experience true freedom outside of true
[53:27] submission to authority.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that here
[53:30] tonight? And Eve thought that she could
[53:33] experience a a greater freedom. She she
[53:36] thought that if she can do her own thing
[53:38] and and not not be submissive to God's
[53:42] word and she can be independent that she
[53:45] would truly be free. AND WE FOUND OUT
[53:47] because of her decision, she wasn't
[53:50] truly made free, but she was eventually
[53:54] dropped into bondage and death. Amen.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; SO TRUE FREEDOM CAN ONLY COME FROM GOD
[53:59] AND CAN ONLY be experienced when you're
[54:02] under the full submission of God and
[54:06] God's word. Amen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; And in order to maintain your freedom,
[54:11] you must stay in your position.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And we see that Queen
[54:17] Vashy wouldn't submit to her husband,
[54:19] the king. And then the power and freedom
[54:21] that she had as a queen was taken from
[54:23] her. We see that KING SAUL WOULDN'T
[54:26] SUBMIT TO THE VOICE OF GOD THROUGH
[54:28] PROPHET SAMUEL. Then the kingdom was
[54:30] removed from him. We we see that ACHEN
[54:33] STOLE A BABYLONIAN GARMENT,
[54:35] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[54:36] &gt;&gt; And a golden wedge IN BABYLON. AND
[54:38] BECAUSE OF HIS LACK of submission to
[54:40] God, his whole family was put to death.
[54:43] Yeah.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't just lose his individual
[54:46] freedom, BUT HIS ENTIRE FAMILY LOST
[54:50] THEIR LIVES. SO, WE SEE THE IMPORTANCE
[54:53] OF SUBMITTING TO THE WORD OF GOD. IT IS
[54:55] SO IMPORTANT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL stay in
[54:58] their position. Ain't that right?
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says here, we we
[55:03] have a home life crisis. It seems that
[55:06] home life is running into shallow water.
[55:09] It used to be in a home that the father,
[55:11] the head of the house, would sit down of
[55:13] the morning and he would speak with his
[55:15] family and they would take out the old
[55:17] family Bible and read just a little bit
[55:20] and all gather around the table and
[55:21] pray. You just don't see that anymore.
[55:25] And when the day was done and Maul had
[55:26] the dishes washed, they would all gather
[55:29] in and read some of the Bible and and
[55:31] pray before going to bed. He said,
[55:33] "Juvenile delinquency certainly was a
[55:35] hard thing to find in those days." Okay,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; the boys all went to work in the fields
[55:40] and the girls helped mom with their
[55:42] washing down at the creek, but today we
[55:45] push a little button and the dishes are
[55:47] done,
[55:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And mom is in the car and gone off to a
[55:50] card party or or out ratting around over
[55:53] the streets and the work is done by a
[55:55] tractor. So we just don't have nothing
[55:58] but just a bunch of lazy idol people
[56:01] &gt;&gt; and the home life is so neglected till
[56:03] the Bible is laidback till they have to
[56:06] hunt for an hour to find one in many
[56:08] homes of America that go to church on
[56:11] Sunday morning for their religion for
[56:13] about 20 minutes and if the pastor takes
[56:15] about 30 minutes he's called on the
[56:18] board. What is it? Home life is running
[56:21] out. Amen. I read an article the other
[56:23] day and it says, "IF YOU HAVE A
[56:24] breakdown of biblical morality, you have
[56:27] a breakdown of the family."
[56:29] &gt;&gt; If you have a breakdown of the family,
[56:32] you have a breakdown of a nation.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Galatians 5:9 says, "A little levan
[56:38] leavenventh the whole up." You you can
[56:41] see THAT IT COULD BE SOMETHING SMALL IN
[56:42] YOUR LIFE THAT YOU MUST DEAL WITH. THAT
[56:45] IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
[56:46] &gt;&gt; YEAH,
[56:46] &gt;&gt; IT MAY SEEM SO SMALL AND AND
[56:48] INSIGNIFICANT IN YOUR LIFE, BUT IT CAN
[56:51] AFFECT YOUR WALK WITH GOD.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; And when YOU HAVE A FAMILY, I'M FINDING
[56:56] OUT ALMOST 15 years now we've been
[56:58] married, AND I'M FINDING OUT THAT MY
[57:00] DECISIONS THAT I MAKE DON'T JUST AFFECT
[57:03] ME NOW. IT AFFECTS MY WHOLE FAMILY.
[57:07] YEAH.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; POOR DECISIONS, CHOICES THAT I'VE MADE
[57:09] IN LIFE, NOT WILLING TO LEAVE THE FAMILY
[57:12] HAS AFFECTED AND PUT SCARS ON MY MY MY
[57:15] CHILDREN AND MY WIFE BECAUSE I WAS OUT
[57:17] OF MY POSITION.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; SO STAYING IN YOUR POSITION IS IT'S SO
[57:22] IMPORTANT BECAUSE TRUE AND LASTING
[57:25] FREEDOM ONLY COMES BY SUBMISSION AND
[57:28] OBEDIENCE TO THE FULL WORD OF GOD.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT?
[57:31] &gt;&gt; YES. JAMES 4:7 SAYS, "SUBMIT YOURSELF TO
[57:34] GOD, RESIST THE DEVIL, and he will flee
[57:39] from you." SO, WE SEE THE FORMULA FOR
[57:41] VICTORY OVER THE DEVIL FIRST BEGINS WITH
[57:44] SUBMISSION. AIN'T THAT RIGHT?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WANT TO RESIST THE DEVIL, BUT
[57:48] THEY DON'T WANT TO SUBMIT TO GOD.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[57:51] &gt;&gt; WE SEE IN THE BIBLE THAT SEVEN WOMEN
[57:53] TOOK ONE MAN AND WANTED HIS NAME. THEY
[57:56] WANTED HIS POWER, BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT
[57:58] TO SUBMIT THEIR LIFE TO THAT NAME.
[58:01] HELLO, SOMEBODY.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; THEY WANTED THE BENEFITS OF THE NAME.
[58:05] THEY WANTED THE AUTHORITY THAT CAME WITH
[58:06] THE NAME, BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SUBMIT
[58:08] THEIR LIFE TO GOD.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SUBMIT THEIR WAY OF
[58:12] THINKING AND THEIR IDEAS AND AND WHAT
[58:14] THEY THINK LIFE SHOULD BE LIKE.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; THEY WANTED THE BLESSINGS OF GOD.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; THEY WANTED THE POWER THAT COMES WITH
[58:21] THE NAME OF GOD, BUT THEY WEREN'T
[58:23] WILLING TO SUBJECT THEIR LIFE TO THE
[58:25] FULL WORD OF GOD.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; OH MY. THEY wanted to do their own
[58:29] thing.
[58:31] Yeah.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Well, WE HEAR IT TODAY. WELL, WE DON'T
[58:36] NEED THAT scripture anymore. OR
[58:38] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T NEED THAT QUOTE ANYMORE. BE
[58:40] CAREFUL.
[58:42] BE CAREFUL. THEY WANT THE BLESSINGS OF
[58:44] IT.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; And if I can say this here tonight, I
[58:49] won't keep YOU LONG.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CANNOT RECEIVE THE GENUINE HOLY
[58:53] GHOST AND REJECT THE WORD OF GOD AT the
[58:56] same time.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. AMEN.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SEE YOURSELF FIGHTING IN THE
[59:01] WORD OF GOD, WELL, I don't believe it
[59:03] that way and well, I don't need that
[59:04] scripture OR I DON'T NEED THAT QUOTE. I
[59:07] WOULD CHECK YOUR EXPERIENCE
[59:09] &gt;&gt; AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE WHAT YOU SAY YOU
[59:11] HAVE. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE HOLY
[59:12] GHOST, NO MATTER HOW HARD IT PRICKS YOUR
[59:15] HEART AND NO MATTER HOW HARD THE PASTOR
[59:17] STEPS ON YOUR TOES, YOU WILL LINE
[59:20] YOURSELF UP WITH THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE
[59:22] THE HOLY GHOST ONLY RECEIVES THE FULL
[59:25] WORD OF GOD.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ONLY SUBJECTS ITSELF TO THE FULL
[59:30] WORD OF GOD.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; YES.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; AND WE SEE THAT SUBMISSION I hope this
[59:36] is okay tonight.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; BUT WE SEE SUBMISSION IS TO THE WORD OF
[59:41] GOD IS THE FIRST STEP TO RESTORING peace
[59:44] to a family. Ain't that right?
[59:47] &gt;&gt; It's also a it can give peace to a
[59:50] nation. It gives peace to a church.
[59:52] Ain't that right?
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we see when a nation refuses
[59:56] to stay with the laws and the word of
[59:59] God, THEN THERE'S TROUBLE THAT COMES FOR
[1:00:02] THAT NATION.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M SO GLAD THAT GOD IS MERCIFUL AND
[1:00:06] GRACIOUS THAT EVEN WHEN WE DO MAKE
[1:00:08] MISTAKES, WE SEE ISRAEL, THEY ALWAYS
[1:00:11] BACKSLID UPON GOD.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME THEY TURN
[1:00:15] BACK TO GOD AGAIN, GOD WAS THERE TO PICK
[1:00:17] THEM UP. WE MAY FALL.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; WE MAY HAVE TROUBLES AND MISTAKES. I MAY
[1:00:22] AS A LEADER OF THE HOME MAKE MY
[1:00:24] MISTAKES. BUT I'M SO GLAD THAT GOD IS
[1:00:26] MERCIFUL.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; THAT HE DOESN'T LEAVE US THERE, BUT HE
[1:00:30] PICKS US UP AGAIN. WE MAY HAVE TO TAKE A
[1:00:33] BEATING.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; WE MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE SEEDS THAT WE
[1:00:36] SOWED. BUT THROUGH GOD'S MERCY, HE CAN
[1:00:39] RESTORE A FAMILY AS LONG AS THAT PERSON
[1:00:42] IS WILLING TO SUBMIT their life to God.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; BUT IT COMES TO THE HEART. ARE WE
[1:00:48] WILLING TO SUBMIT TO GOD?
[1:00:51] AMEN.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; We know a LOT OF PEOPLE TODAY ARE ARE
[1:00:55] TRYING TO FIND A RELIGION that fits
[1:00:57] their lifestyle.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; They want to go to A CHURCH THAT THAT IS
[1:01:01] OKAY WITH HOW THEY LIVE.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; THAT ONLY GOD ONLY LOOKS AT THE HEART.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, I I WANT TO GO TO A
[1:01:09] PLACE WHERE THERE'S CORRECTION IN THE
[1:01:11] HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; IF I'M WRONG, GOD CORRECTS ME.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF I IF I NEED TO LEAD MY FAMILY
[1:01:18] AS WE HEARD SUNDAY, THEN GOD CHANGE THE
[1:01:21] DIRECTION.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T ALLOW ME TO JUST TO GO THROUGH
[1:01:25] LIFE THINKING I'M OKAY.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; GOD WON'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A TRUE DAUGHTER AND SON OF
[1:01:32] GOD, GOD WON'T LET YOU GO THROUGH LIFE
[1:01:35] THINKING YOU'RE OKAY.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WILL BRING YOU DOWN.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD'S MERCY.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; YES, HE WILL.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, HOW DO YOU KNOW? I'VE
[1:01:43] EXPERIENCED THAT. I WAS GOING THROUGH
[1:01:46] LIFE DOING MY OWN THING.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS GOD'S MERCY THAT REACHED
[1:01:50] DOWN.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I WAS OKAY. I'M A PASTOR'S
[1:01:55] SON. I I PLAY MUSIC IN THE CHURCH. I I I
[1:01:59] LEAD SONGS. I I'M OKAY. BUT WE FOUND OUT
[1:02:02] THAT YOUR ABILITIES IS NOT WHAT SAVES
[1:02:04] YOU.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHAT SAVES YOU AND WHAT KEEPS
[1:02:09] YOU ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW IS THE
[1:02:11] HOLY GHOST DOWN DEEP INSIDE THAT'S
[1:02:14] THAT'S CHECKING YOUR HEART.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN WE MAKE MISTAKES, repent and
[1:02:21] get up again.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Dad mentioned this Sunday, but
[1:02:26] every family, it is God,
[1:02:30] it is man, it is woman, and it is child.
[1:02:33] 2 Corinthians 11:3 says, "But I would
[1:02:36] have you know that the head of every man
[1:02:38] is Christ,
[1:02:40] and the head of the woman is man, and
[1:02:42] the head of Christ is God." Ephesians
[1:02:45] 5:22 says, "Wives, submit yourselves
[1:02:48] unto your husbands as unto the Lord."
[1:02:50] Ephesians 6:1, "Children, obey your
[1:02:53] parents." I hope this is okay tonight,
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; for this IS RIGHT. HONOR THY FATHER AND
[1:02:57] MOTHER, which is the first commandment
[1:03:00] with promise, that it may be well with
[1:03:02] thee, and thou that thou mayest live
[1:03:04] long on the earth.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And you fathers, provoke not your
[1:03:07] children to wrath, but bring them up in
[1:03:10] the nurture and admiration of the Lord.
[1:03:13] Servants, be obedient to them that are
[1:03:15] your masters according to the flesh,
[1:03:17] with fear and trembling,
[1:03:20] and in singleness of heart
[1:03:22] as unto Christ. So we see a united
[1:03:25] family is very powerful. Ain't that
[1:03:27] right?
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, IT IS
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD DESIGNED THE FAMILY UNIT AND
[1:03:33] THE FAMILY IS WHAT GOD IS EXPRESSED IN
[1:03:37] HIMSELF
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; OUTSIDE OF THE FAMILY. GOD CANNOT BE
[1:03:41] FULLY REVEALED BECAUSE GOD IS A FAMILY.
[1:03:43] HOW MANY CAN SAY THAT?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; AND I FEEL TONIGHT THAT THIS CHURCH IS A
[1:03:48] FAMILY.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; WE MAY HAVE OUR UPS AND DOWNS. WE WE MAY
[1:03:52] HAVE OUR DISAGREEMENTS AND ARGUMENTS,
[1:03:54] BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE'RE A
[1:03:56] FAMILY.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S POWER IN UNITY. SATAN WANTS
[1:03:59] TO DESTROY UNITY.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO DESTROY THE NATURAL FAMILY
[1:04:04] AS WELL AS THE SPIRITUAL FAMILY.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; HE'S TRYING TO BRING DIVISION WITHIN THE
[1:04:09] CHURCH. HELLO, SOMEBODY. AND IF HE COULD
[1:04:12] KEEP US BICKERING AT ONE ANOTHER, HE'S
[1:04:14] GOT US DEFEATED. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH
[1:04:16] POWER AND UNITY. WHY DO YOU THINK SATAN
[1:04:18] IS TRYING TO BREAK IT UP? BECAUSE HE
[1:04:21] KNOWS THE POWER THAT LAYS WITH INSIDE
[1:04:24] UNITY IN THIS CHURCH.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; WE MAY GET TIRED. WE MAY GET WEARY,
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S EACH OTHER THAT IS LIFTING ONE
[1:04:32] ANOTHER UP AGAIN.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; It's unity. WE DON'T LEAVE THE OTHER TO
[1:04:36] THE SIDE.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE FALL, WE UNITE TOGETHER TO BRING
[1:04:40] THAT ONE UP AGAIN.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT A FAMILY DOES.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, SIR.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; We see that Satan
[1:04:55] is trying to take out the shepherd of
[1:04:58] the flock. We heard that Sunday. I hope
[1:05:00] this is okay. I just felt to go this
[1:05:02] way.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 34 and5 it says, "And they were
[1:05:06] scattered BECAUSE THERE WAS NO shepherd
[1:05:09] and they became meat to all the beasts
[1:05:11] of the field when they were scattered."
[1:05:14] Satan is trying to take out the
[1:05:16] shepherd.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; He knows if he can take out the
[1:05:20] shepherd, what's going to happen TO THE
[1:05:21] FLOCK?
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF A CHURCH HAS
[1:05:25] NO PASTOR?
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; SURE.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Without a shepherd,
[1:05:33] THE SHEEP SCATTER.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE'S TRYING TO TAKE OUT THE
[1:05:36] SHEPHERD OF THE HOME BECAUSE HE KNOWS IF
[1:05:39] HE TAKES out Come on, somebody.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. YEAH.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE WHAT happens
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; when the shepherd is taken OUT OF THE
[1:05:48] HOME.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; YOU WATCH A FAMILY FALL APART
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT THE
[1:05:54] FAMILY IS SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WILL DIVIDE THE church against
[1:06:05] the pastor and the pastor against the
[1:06:07] church and MEMBERS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.
[1:06:10] I'VE SEEN IN THIS MESSAGE WHERE THE
[1:06:11] MINISTRY IS UNDER ATTACK. AND IF YOU
[1:06:14] HAVE A PASTOR THAT'S IN THE WILL OF GOD,
[1:06:17] HE WILL BE UNDER ATTACK.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that tonight?
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, "But by one
[1:06:26] spirit, we're all baptized into the
[1:06:27] body."
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; And that body is a family, the family of
[1:06:32] God. And that's the house of God. And
[1:06:35] the house of God is the name of Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ. The name of the Lord is a mighty
[1:06:39] tower. The righteous run into it and are
[1:06:42] saved. He says here and here you are a
[1:06:44] person. I'm preaching the word saying
[1:06:46] that he's not dead. He's alive. He's
[1:06:48] alive and he's identified himself in our
[1:06:52] flesh.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Human flesh like he did back then. See,
[1:06:56] all that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:06:59] All that Christ was, he poured into the
[1:07:01] church. That's him. Christ in us. HE
[1:07:05] SAYS, "OH GOD, IF THE WORLD COULD see
[1:07:08] that man and GOD ARE ONE, THE SUPER SIGN
[1:07:11] WAS THE FIRST MAN THAT GOD COULD COME
[1:07:13] INTO. AND ALL THAT GOD WAS, HE POURED
[1:07:16] INTO CHRIST. AND ALL THAT CHRIST WAS, HE
[1:07:19] POURED INTO THE CHURCH. IT'S A SUPER
[1:07:21] SIGN. GOD AND MAN TOGETHER. That was the
[1:07:24] super sign of the last day WHEN THE
[1:07:26] ENTIRE BIBLE WAS TO BE fulfilled in the
[1:07:29] last day." So, we see that THE PURPOSE
[1:07:32] THAT WAS IN GOD'S MIND FROM THE
[1:07:34] BEGINNING WAS TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS
[1:07:36] himself through a many membered body.
[1:07:39] Ain't that right?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED a family. Ain't that right? I
[1:07:44] know this is simple tonight and I'll try
[1:07:46] to shut IT DOWN FAST, BUT GOD WANTED A
[1:07:48] FAMILY.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; HE HAD ATTRIBUTES THAT THAT IDENTIFIED
[1:07:52] HIM AS A HEALER AND AND A FATHER, BUT HE
[1:07:56] COULDN'T DISPLAY THOSE ATTRIBUTES.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH. SO, WE SEE THE PLAN OF GOD THAT
[1:08:01] THAT CAUSED THE FALL OF MAN.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH
[1:08:07] MAN.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED SOMEONE THAT HE COULD TALK LIP
[1:08:11] TO EAR WITH. OH my
[1:08:15] [laughter]
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; SO, THE GREAT PLAN OF GOD BEGIN TO
[1:08:20] UNFOLD.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:08:23] AND WE SEE THAT GOD THROUGH TIME HAS NOW
[1:08:25] MADE A WAY FOR MAN TO COME BACK TO GOD
[1:08:28] AGAIN.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; LORD JESUS.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS CHRISTMAS WHERE WHERE
[1:08:33] CHRIST WAS BORN.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; MADE A WAY FOR MAN AND GOD TO BE UNITED
[1:08:38] AGAIN.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF GOD'S GREAT
[1:08:43] REDEMPTIVE PLAN.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; YES. YES.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:48] AND NOW WE SEE THAT MAN OF GOD HAS
[1:08:51] RELATIONSHIP AGAIN. BUT THE ONLY WAY TO
[1:08:54] BE ABLE TO HAVE FULL RELATIONSHIP WITH
[1:08:56] GOD IS TO HAVE A FULL SUBMISSION to his
[1:08:59] word.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; NOT OUR OWN IDEAS,
[1:09:04] NOT OUR OWN THINKING,
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; NOT WHAT WHO NOT WHAT THIS PERSON SAID
[1:09:08] OR THAT PERSON SAID, BUT WHAT THIS BIBLE
[1:09:11] SAYS.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; WE LIGHT UP OUR LIFE WITH THIS.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; There you go. AND WE SEE NOW
[1:09:19] THAT HE IS IN ANOTHER form today. SHE IS
[1:09:23] HIM. THEY CAME TO JESUS AND SAID, "SHOW
[1:09:26] US THE FATHER." AND JESUS SAID, "HAVE I
[1:09:28] NOT BEEN WITH YOU FOR SO LONG? WHEN
[1:09:30] YOU'VE SEEN ME, YOU SEE THE FATHER.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORLD WANTS TO SEE GOD, WHO DO
[1:09:37] THEY LOOK TO?"
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; THEY LOOK TO YOU.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOW GOD DWELLING IN FLESH AGAIN.
[1:09:46] YEAH.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; OH, HELLO SOMEBODY.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; HELLO, PREACHER.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; SO, WE SEE THE PURPOSE, SATAN'S PURPOSE
[1:09:53] FROM THE BEGINNING WAS TO DISRUPT THIS
[1:09:56] PLAN. HE KNEW.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; He knew if he g IF IF MAN AND GOD GOT
[1:10:01] BACK TOGETHER, HE KNEW WHAT WOULD TAKE
[1:10:03] PLACE.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU THINK HE FIGHTS SO HARD?
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY. HE KNOWS. HE'S SCARED.
[1:10:10] HE'S SCARED OF WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE
[1:10:12] PLACE WHEN YOU BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE WHO
[1:10:14] YOU ARE. YEAH.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; AND YOU REALIZE THE SAME AUTHORITY THAT
[1:10:18] JESUS CHRIST HAD ON EARTH
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; is the SAME AUTHORITY YOU HAVE HERE
[1:10:22] TONIGHT.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; SO THE DEVIL HAS BROUGHT DESTRUCTION on
[1:10:31] the first family.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Satan knows that God I hope this is
[1:10:39] okay.
[1:10:40] AMEN.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD CREATED A MARRIAGE AS A A
[1:10:43] beautiful living picture of Christ in
[1:10:45] the church. AND SATAN KNOWS THE VALUE OF
[1:10:48] FAMILY.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And he knows if HE CAN SUCCESSFULLY TEAR
[1:10:57] IT APART,
[1:10:59] take away unity again.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; And you see what HAS HAPPENED? HE'S
[1:11:04] BROUGHT DESTRUCTION.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. HE'S BROUGHT DESTRUCTION TO
[1:11:10] THE NATURAL FAMILY BECAUSE he knows the
[1:11:12] IMPORTANCE OF IT. YOU WANT TO SEE
[1:11:14] VICTORY WITHIN A CHURCH, bring a spirit
[1:11:16] of unity back in the church again.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; You want to SEE VICTORY IN YOUR HOME,
[1:11:21] BRING A SPIRIT OF UNITY BACK INTO THE
[1:11:23] HOME AGAIN.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; AND YOU WATCH WHEN YOU BRING CHRIST BACK
[1:11:29] IN THE HOME AGAIN. OH MY. YOU WATCH A
[1:11:31] FAMILY THAT'S DYSFUNCTIONAL COME BACK
[1:11:33] TOGETHER AGAIN BECAUSE GOD IS THE ONE
[1:11:36] THAT'S HEALING THE FAMILY. HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; SATAN HAS MEANT TO DESTROY YOU, BUT GOD
[1:11:42] HAS KEPT YOU TOGETHER.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And it LOOKS LIKE THAT SATAN HAS
[1:11:46] SUCCEEDED. OH MY.
[1:11:48] BUT GOD HAS KEPT YOU TOGETHER.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Thank God for HIS KEEPING POWER.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW I'M TOGETHER WITH MY WIFE IS
[1:11:58] GOD KEPT US TOGETHER.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Oh my.
[1:12:05] I don't think any of us would be here if
[1:12:06] it wasn't for God's keeping power.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; And if I can say this tonight, I'M I'M
[1:12:14] SICK and tired of seeing the devil have
[1:12:16] his way with the family.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; I'M SICK AND TIRED OF OF HIM HAVING HIS
[1:12:22] WAY WITH MY WIFE AND MY CHILDREN AND
[1:12:24] CAUSING CHAOS IN THE HOME.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S TIME WE TAKE A STAND AND
[1:12:29] SAY, "SATAN, YOU CAN'T HAVE MY HOME ANY
[1:12:31] LONGER. RIGHT.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; WE MUST FIGHT FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; My my my. There's power in unity.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says a person can live
[1:12:43] so close to God that the devil wouldn't
[1:12:46] know what to do with him.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; If I CAN SAY THIS, A CHURCH, A FAMILY
[1:12:52] CAN LIVE SO CLOSE TO GOD.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; THAT THE DEVIL WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
[1:12:56] TO DO WITH YOU.
[1:12:58] YOU COULD BE SO CLOSE TOGETHER AS A
[1:13:01] FAMILY THAT SATAN WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
[1:13:03] WHERE TO BEGIN.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME THAT WE GET THAT RESOLVE BACK
[1:13:09] IN THE CHURCH AGAIN, BACK IN OUR
[1:13:12] FAMILIES AGAIN, AND SAY, "I AM MAKING NO
[1:13:15] ROOM FOR THE DEVIL."
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS ME.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [applause]
[1:13:21] All right.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT HURTS.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; SATAN WILL HAVE NO WIGGLE ROOM ANY
[1:13:27] LONGER.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; OH MY.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; There's a saying,
[1:13:38] [snorts] how long have I been up here?
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; There's a saying. It says, "United we
[1:13:45] stay, undivided we fall."
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:48] And there's two parables that are are
[1:13:50] with this saying. And it says here, "The
[1:13:53] four oxen and the lion." It says, "The
[1:13:55] lion used to prowl about a field in
[1:13:57] which four oxmen used to dwell."
[1:13:59] [snorts]
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Many a time he tried to attack them, but
[1:14:03] whenever he came near, they turned their
[1:14:05] tails one to another, so that whichever
[1:14:08] way he approached them, he was met by
[1:14:10] the horns of one of them.
[1:14:12] At last, however, they fell a quarreling
[1:14:15] among themselves, and each went off to
[1:14:17] pastor along in the separate corner of
[1:14:19] the field.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Then the lion attacked them one by one
[1:14:24] and made an end to all four. Satan is
[1:14:28] smart and how he strategizes.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; He's not stupid. He knows when we're
[1:14:34] united and we have a united front,
[1:14:36] THERE'S NO WAY he can penetrate our
[1:14:38] forces. I believe that
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; there's no way when we're standing
[1:14:41] shouldertosh shoulder, ARM TO ARM, NO
[1:14:44] MATTER OUR DIFFERENCES, WE'RE SAYING WE
[1:14:46] ARE GOING TO UNITE TOGETHER. NO MATTER
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; WHAT IT TAKES, we're not going to let
[1:14:52] Satan in. BUT ONCE THEY STARTED TO
[1:14:55] BICKER among themselves,
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; MY
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; THAT UNITED FRONT, THAT STRENGTH, THAT
[1:15:01] STONE WALL THAT THEY HAD,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; WAS NOW BROKEN APART. AND IT SAYS HERE,
[1:15:06] "THE LION TOOK ALL FOUR of them one BY
[1:15:09] ONE. FOR WE'RE NOT CAREFUL.
[1:15:12] SATAN CAN come in and take us out ONE BY
[1:15:16] ONE BY ONE." I'VE SAID IT BEFORE.
[1:15:18] ISOLATION IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. IT'S THE
[1:15:20] ENEMY'S TOOL.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; IF HE CAN GET us isolated.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH. THINKING THAT WE'RE NOT
[1:15:28] LOVED, WE'RE NOT ACCEPTED, THAT NOBODY
[1:15:30] CARES, NOBODY NEEDS US. WHAT'S GOING TO
[1:15:33] HAPPEN IF WE ISOLATE OURSEL from the
[1:15:35] pack?
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Satan can come in. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE
[1:15:41] WEARY, STAY UNITED.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TIRED AND YOU YOU DON'T
[1:15:46] FEEL LIKE YOU COULD GO ON, THAT'S WHAT
[1:15:48] FAMILY IS FOR.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; All right, brother.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; But he will hit you at your lowest.
[1:15:56] The other one here
[1:15:58] says THIS SHORT FABLE TELLS OF A MAN
[1:16:00] WHOSE SONS often quarreled among
[1:16:02] themselves
[1:16:03] to show the benefit of to show them the
[1:16:06] benefit of working together. He brings a
[1:16:09] bundle of sticks. He asked them to break
[1:16:11] the bundle of sticks. As expected, the
[1:16:14] brothers could not break the sticks when
[1:16:17] they were together.
[1:16:19] However, they can easily be broken
[1:16:21] individually. The moral of the story is
[1:16:24] written. He says, "My sons, you are of
[1:16:27] one mind and unite to assist each other.
[1:16:30] You will be as this bundle,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; okay?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Uninjured by all attempts of your
[1:16:35] enemies. BUT IF YOU ARE DIVIDED among
[1:16:38] yourselves, you will be broken as easily
[1:16:42] as these sticks."
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; So we see the importance [snorts] of
[1:16:47] being unified together,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Of a family.
[1:16:52] I'm going skip some of this here and say
[1:16:54] our our biggest enemy is ourselves. How
[1:16:57] many can say that tonight?
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE FAIL TO BE IN SUBMISSION, IT'S
[1:17:01] NOT MY WIFE, it's not the pastor, it's
[1:17:04] it's not your your the individuals in a
[1:17:07] church, but it's yourself.
[1:17:10] You can bring change within a family.
[1:17:14] THESE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BRING A FIRE
[1:17:15] WITHIN A CHURCH.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF WE CAN BRING OURSELVES UNDER
[1:17:22] THE FULL WORD OF GOD, IT'S AMAZING HOW
[1:17:24] GOD CAN USE THAT INDIVIDUAL.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; YEAH, they are.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Colby, I I make
[1:17:35] mistakes. We're, you know, we're human.
[1:17:37] We make mistakes." But
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; do we want TO BE LIKE SAUL OR DO WE WANT
[1:17:42] TO BE like David?
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:44] WE COULD BE LIKE SAUL WITH THE ATTITUDE,
[1:17:46] WELL PROPHET, HONOR me in front OF THE
[1:17:49] PEOPLE.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; JUST HONOR ME. BECAUSE OF HIS PRIDE, HE
[1:17:53] LOST THE KINGDOM. BUT DAVID,
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; YEAH,
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS DAVID WAS A MAN AFTER
[1:17:58] GOD'S OWN HEART. REALIZE THIS. SAUL ONLY
[1:18:01] MADE ONE MISTAKE.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF HIS PRIDE, WHAT HAPPENED?
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; HE LOST THE KINGDOM. DAVID MADE MULTIPLE
[1:18:10] MISTAKES.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; YEAH. RIGHT. BUT BECAUSE OF HIS
[1:18:13] ATTITUDE,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE HEARD, "YOU'RE THE MAN."
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; HE RIPPED HIS CLOTHES AND HE CRIED OUT
[1:18:22] TO GOD FOR HIS MERCY.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF HIS heart of humility.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:18:30] Not, well, I'm caught in the mistake, so
[1:18:32] I'm sorry. But no, HIS HEART WAS, GOD, I
[1:18:35] AM WRONG.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; I am wrong.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:18:41] And he SAYS, "I WOULD RATHER FALL IN THE
[1:18:43] HANDS OF GOD THAN THE HANDS OF MAN."
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE THE MERCY IS.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; All right, brother. Hallelujah.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; We make mistakes, but friends, we must
[1:18:54] fall into the hands of merciful God.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL BRING US BACK together again.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Do you love him here tonight? Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Now the first
[1:19:10] man and first woman in the Garden of
[1:19:12] Eden was in perfect harmony with God so
[1:19:16] much that God could come down at any
[1:19:18] time he desired and talk lip to ear with
[1:19:20] Adam and Eve." Now that is perfect
[1:19:22] oneness. God and his creation,
[1:19:25] God speaking lip to ear with Adam and
[1:19:27] Eve. And they were so perfect in HARMONY
[1:19:30] WITH GOD TILL they were one with God.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; God and his family was one. And any man
[1:19:37] in his family, a correct, good, noble,
[1:19:39] obedient family is one with another. Any
[1:19:42] family. And if there's something in that
[1:19:44] family that moves them apart, then
[1:19:46] that's not right. The family is broken
[1:19:48] somewhere. They should all be one.
[1:19:51] Father with mother, mother with father,
[1:19:53] children with parent, parent with child,
[1:19:56] all in agreement. And when you see that,
[1:19:58] you'll see one lovely picture.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOD'S PURPOSE. and his purpose as
[1:20:04] father supreme was to be one with his
[1:20:07] family.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; His earthly family, Adam and Eve.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And the only way that they could be one
[1:20:13] with the family or with God was because
[1:20:16] God's nature was in them.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; So that made them with God's nature in
[1:20:21] them. Then with each other and God, they
[1:20:24] became all one.
[1:20:26] Isn't that A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE? GOD and
[1:20:28] his family. Father above all, supreme.
[1:20:31] No death, no sorrow, no heartaches, no
[1:20:34] nothing. Just joy unspeakable. My, what
[1:20:36] a time. Never to be sick, never to have
[1:20:39] a heartache, just one with God. What a
[1:20:42] picture. Because the very nature of God
[1:20:46] was in these people. And therefore, what
[1:20:48] they did, they followed just in line
[1:20:51] with God and God with them making them
[1:20:55] one.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; My amen. WE SEE THAT GOD DESIGNED MAN TO
[1:21:00] BE GOVERNED FROM THE inside out.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Dad wrote a song. Write your word on the
[1:21:06] pages of my heart. Dear Lord, LET ME
[1:21:09] HIDE THEM FOREVER AND NOT LET THEM GO.
[1:21:12] WE UNDERSTAND THAT CHANGE NEEDS TO
[1:21:15] HAPPEN FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WANT TO CHANGE FROM THE OUTSIDE
[1:21:19] IN. IF IF THEY CAN LOOK HOLY ON THE
[1:21:21] OUTSIDE AND LOOK SPIRITUAL AND AND LOOK
[1:21:24] OKAY ON THE OUTSIDE, THEN THEY'RE SAVED.
[1:21:26] THAT'S NOT HOW GOD WORKS.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO CHANGE THE MAN FROM THE
[1:21:30] INSIDE OUT.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; THAT WAY WHEN THINGS HAPPEN IN YOUR
[1:21:35] LIFE, YOU DON'T REVERT BACK TO WHAT YOU
[1:21:37] WERE
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE ON THE INSIDE OF
[1:21:40] YOU THAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM GOING BACK
[1:21:42] TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO MY PRAYER IS, LORD, WRITE
[1:21:48] YOUR word
[1:21:50] on the pages of MY HEART TONIGHT.
[1:21:53] MAY I be able to be submissive even when
[1:21:55] I'm wrong.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; I gotta say, Sunday morning,
[1:22:03] I took a little of a beat in myself.
[1:22:06] Didn't mean that in a bad way. No, it
[1:22:08] was a good message.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; I needed it.
[1:22:12] I needed that for my own life.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Right, brother. [laughter] Amen.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Jeremiah 31:33 says, "But
[1:22:21] this shall be the covenant that I will
[1:22:23] make with the house of Israel after
[1:22:24] those days, sayeth the Lord, I will put
[1:22:27] my law in the inward parts
[1:22:30] and write it in their hearts and will be
[1:22:33] their God, and they shall be
[1:22:36] my people."
[1:22:39] Brother Brandham says here, as I'm about
[1:22:40] to close, it says, "These battles have
[1:22:42] raged since the day of the Garden of
[1:22:44] Eden, the battle in the human mind.
[1:22:47] Satan started it. What did he do when he
[1:22:49] met Eve? He didn't deny God's word, but
[1:22:52] he whitewashed it.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; He stopped up some little channels here
[1:22:56] somewhere. And he said, "But surely
[1:22:58] God."
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if we're not careful,
[1:23:04] we'll allow Satan to talk us out of
[1:23:06] something.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. as our musicians come now. Got a
[1:23:13] few more quotes and then I'll I'll be
[1:23:15] done here tonight.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Appreciate your patience with us.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, he says,
[1:23:24] "Make the carnal mind," the carnal mind
[1:23:27] shuns it because the carnal mind doesn't
[1:23:29] know, does not know a thing about it. No
[1:23:32] wonder the carnal mind doesn't know it
[1:23:34] because it's Satan in that carnal mind.
[1:23:36] And Satan is exposed.
[1:23:39] And Satan does not want himself exposed.
[1:23:41] You know how horrible it is for Satan
[1:23:43] when he thinks he's going to be exposed.
[1:23:46] Watch in one of the services. Watch the
[1:23:48] action of the people. You watch out on a
[1:23:50] meeting just before Satan is exposed
[1:23:52] over a certain person. You'll see their
[1:23:54] face change. You see, they don't even
[1:23:56] know what to think. All once the Holy
[1:23:57] Spirit comes down and exposes the devil.
[1:24:00] Oh, he hates that kind of meeting.
[1:24:03] That's the reason we have such a battle
[1:24:04] because the word of God exposes the
[1:24:07] devil. See, it tells him what he is.
[1:24:11] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS SATAN FIGHTS
[1:24:12] harder every time something goes wrong
[1:24:15] because Satan is trying to keep the
[1:24:17] people in tension and everything else so
[1:24:20] that he can keep them away from this
[1:24:22] great strain that we're going to enter
[1:24:24] into for the great, as we would say,
[1:24:26] going in for the kill. Now, he's already
[1:24:30] beat up in the corner. He's already been
[1:24:32] exposed. How many thankful for that? And
[1:24:35] all of his devices are exposed and men
[1:24:37] and women has accepted Jesus Christ as
[1:24:40] their savior. He said, "Now here sits a
[1:24:43] group of people here tonight waiting
[1:24:45] under great anticipation."
[1:24:47] And Satan, if he can interrupt their
[1:24:49] mind, that's all [music] he has to do.
[1:24:51] But let's go now for the great kill.
[1:24:53] Amen. And just now to drive Satan and
