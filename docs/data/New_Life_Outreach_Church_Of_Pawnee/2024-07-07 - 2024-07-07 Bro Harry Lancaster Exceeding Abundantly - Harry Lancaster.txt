with you let's go ahead and turn to Philippians chapter 4 Philippians chapter 4 and verse 19 but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus let's turn to Ephesians chapter three Ephesians chapter 3 and we'll start at verse 20 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen Lord Jesus we just come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord we thank you for this beautiful day that you've given us today Lord we thank you for allowing us to gather here together once more and Lord we pray that you would just Lord take control of the remainder of the service Lord Lord may you

direct me Lord to Lord may you be the one to inspire the words that are that come forth Lord and Lord may it just be a blessing to the people Lord we just pray that you would take control Lord and that you would receive all the glory we just love you and we thank you for all that you do for us in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen all right you may have your seats we're going to turn back to First Kings chapter 17 I just started thinking a little bit tonight and started thinking about God our provider and how he meets all of our needs and as the verse says how he supplies all of our needs and takes care of everything for us and just was kind of thinking about the goodness of God in so many ways and let's kind of see where where exactly we would go with this but first Kings chapter 17 and we're going to start at verse 8 and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zarap which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zarafat and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou Hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of Mill shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah now we all know this uh this history that that we read in the Bible it's been preached on so many times I'm sure all of us can think of different sermons that have been brought out about this but there's just one point that I'm kind of wanting to to focus on is is as we're talking as we're looking at God's provision here you know God came Elijah was had come and given the the prophecy and said there will be no rain and he had gone out and God was providing for him by the the Ravens bringing him the food and he had the brook to drink from and then finally all of that the brook dried up and there was no more water in the land and it was at that point that God had to provide for the prophet in another way now God could have you know kept the water running he could have had a spring burst up right there to keep the river flowing or the creek flowing or whatever he could have Pro provided in whichever way but God was going to provide in a different way God was going to go a different route than what he expected might be you know Elijah probably wasn't thinking that he was going to have to move again he probably wasn't thinking that he was going to get relocated again until it was time to go back to Ahab and face down everything that was going on he probably thought great I'm here I'm hanging out I'm good I've got my food I've got my water all is well and God could have provided in so many ways um I mean when we first go into the fact that he provided using a raven to deliver the bread and flesh okay he had the original Uber food coming in or the original door Dash take your pick of what you want to call it God did it first um he had the food delivery coming but then when the water dried up God didn't just make a spring he didn't just make a pool form there he didn't just bring a single raincloud to just water where Elijah was he didn't do any of these different ways instead he said I want you to go down to this widow woman I want or I want you to go down to this town I have prepared a widow woman now this widow woman didn't know what was happening she didn't know what was coming and when Elijah comes down she has to make her decision as I said we've heard so many sermons about this but you know God could have provided just for Elijah he could have taken care of just Elijah he could have taken care of just his Prophet but God chose to provide another way that would go above and beyond what Elijah might have even expected Elijah just thought he would be taken care of he just thought I'm here the food will keep coming the water will keep coming I'm set but God looked and went no actually I've got another child that I need taking care of I've got another two children down there that I need taken care of so I'm just going to send Elijah down there so I can take care of all three of you at the same time so I can provide above what you might be expecting the the woman didn't expect to be provided for she thought she was going to have her last meal and she was going to die Elijah thought that he was going to be provided for somewhere else until God spoke to him but then God put them together and went I'm going to provide enough for not just one Elijah by himself not just two the woman and and her child I'm going to make sure that there's enough for all three of you I'm going to make sure that there's enough meal and there's enough oil for the entirety of the for everyone he didn't just provide for the prophet but he sustained the Widow and her son through the entire famine let's turn to 2 Kings chapter 4 2 Kings chapter 4 and we'll start at verse one now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be Bond men and Elisha said unto her whatat shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art come in Thou shalt shut the doors upon thee and upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all these vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her son who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed and she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy Children of the rest now this woman came to Elisha to bring to him the need and said my husband is dead and you know that he was a godly man and he even she even calls her husband thy servant so there's some sort of familiarity here some sort of of knowledge Elisha knew who this man was in some way I don't know how close I don't know how far but he knew who he was and the woman could say you know he was a Godly Man and Elisha didn't dispute that he didn't argue that point and I would guess that the woman didn't come to Elisha expecting what was to come she probably came to Elisha in the mindset of can you speak to the creditors can you tell them to go away can you tell them to leave us alone can you tell them to do something can you step in and take care of this sit situation you're the prophet everyone knows you're the prophet if you go and you talk to them they'll probably write off the debt and I can just live with my sons more than likely that's going to be what is in her mind she's not coming in thinking I'm going to go to Elisha so he can do a miracle to pay off my debt for me because that's not the way the human mind works she went to Elisha with okay he has power and authority because he's the prophet he can talk to them for me cuz in this day and age I'm just a woman I can't I can't do that much so the prophet can step in and he can take care of it for me and Elisha even asks he says what shall I do for thee now the scripture doesn't show that there's a pause there it doesn't show that he asks and then waits for her to tell him what do you want me to do he says what would you have me do and then immediately goes into what do you have in your house and she says I have this jar of oil cuz up till now she had probably been trying to do a lot of it on her own selling whatever small possession she might have had in the house to try to pay off the debt to try to do different things to do what she could with what she had and now all she had was I have this oil that's it this is my possession I have this oil and so then Elisha gives her the instruction and says go get as many jars and bowls and containers as you can possibly borrow don't get just a few get as many as possible and so you can just see her sending her kids to go to every single neighbor to go how many spare jars do you have my mom needs them you can just just see it you know here comes Haven running up to knock on the door sister April do you have any spare jars yes I'll take whatever whatever you have well I've got a big one and then a couple small ones I'll take them all whatever you've got well all I've got are two small ones I'll take those and just going through the neighborhood going through the church neighborhood just knocking on doors can I borrow some J jars well what size jars you need doesn't matter I just need jars mom didn't tell me what size I need I just need jars whatever you've got I'll take them I'll take whatever I can get until finally they get every single jar that they can possibly borrow they have bankrupted the neighborhood there are no empty vessels left they're all at their house and then they close up the house and they start to fill them one by one by one until finally there are no empty vessels left every single one is filled with oil and the Widow doesn't actually know what to do she has done this until she goes back to the prophet again saying okay I've got all this oil and so then he instructs and he says great go and sell all the oil that you've got now pay your debts pay off the creditors and then live off the rest God could have provided just enough to pay off the creditors that was the need that she came in with she came in saying the creditors are going to take my children this is what my need is right she didn't say and I have no one to provide I need more she came in and said my need is to save my boys to save my children this is my need and yet in that God goes and provides and goes above it Beyond he goes to provide more he takes care of the need and then he addresses what he already knows will be the next need cuz Hey if she doesn't have a way to provide we're going to end up in this exact same situation down the road she's going to be back in debt to creditors cuz she's trying to survive so God takes the need and provides for it and then he goes beyond just to make sure that she's taken care of to give her so much more than she could expect so much more than she could be looking for as it said in Ephesians now to him that is able to do exceeding and abundantly above all that we ask or think she didn't come in asking for the excess she didn't come in asking for more she came in with this is the need this is what needs to be taken care of but yet God went beyond that God provided abundantly God gave her more and the prophet instructed pay off the debt and then live off of the rest now I'm sure it wasn't so much that she was a rich woman in the neighborhood now but there was enough cu the prophet said and live off of the rest he didn't say live off this until you can get a job or live off this until you can do this or do that he said live off of the rest I don't think that God was putting in a timeline of I'm going to give her enough for six months or I'm going to give her enough for two months or give her enough for whatever it was I'm providing for you maybe he was providing enough until the boys could be old enough to work this might have been not enough for her to live for the rest of her days but maybe it was enough until her boys were old enough that they could go and start having a trade and bring in their income and then they would be able to step up and take care of their widowed mother the scriptures don't say exactly how but it does say God provided more than what the need was he provided abundantly he Pro provided over and above what she was asking for in the same chapter if we drop down to verse 42 2 Kings chapter 4 and verse 42 it says and there came a man from balisha and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits 20 loaves of barley and full ears of corn and the husk thereof and he said give unto the people that they may eat and his servant are said what should I set this before in 100 men and he said again give the people that they may eat for thus sayeth the Lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of the Lord God didn't just provide enough the prophet said set it before the hundred set it before the men that are here I mean the servant would have been impressed if just the hundred had all eaten but God told the prophet and told him they will eat and there will be some left now it doesn't say exactly how much is left there could have been a few scraps of loaf on the table and that was it but there was something left it wasn't their empty plates with crumbs it was there was something substantial enough that you could say there is food left if someone else walked in off the street right now there is food to offer there is something worthwhile that is still left we have provided for the hundred and gone beyond that let's go to Matthew chapter 14 Matthew chapter 14 and starting at verse 14 and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now passed send the multitude away that they may go into the villages to buy themselves victuals and Jesus said unto them they need not depart give ye them to eat and they said unto him we have here but Five Loaves and two fishes he said bring them hither to me and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the Five Loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and break and gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the fragments that remained 12 baskets full and they that had eaten were about 5,000 men besides women and children none of these verses that I'm reading are things that we don't probably know by heart most of these are stories that were taught in Sunday School school that probably our children can recite because they've been gone over and covered this isn't anything new this isn't anything we've never heard before but sometimes it's a good reminder that God provides and God provides abundantly now in no way am I trying to do some sort of uh gospel that we're all going to get rich and we're all going to have so much money that we're all going to be wealthy but at the same time we don't serve a God that has to scrape the bottom of the barrel to provide when he has the cattle on a thousand hills and he can meet every single need and so often he does more than just meet the need he gives us more you know how often in our in our lives are we trying to figure out how we're going to pay this bill or how we're going to do if we're looking at it purely from the Physical Realm how we're going to provide to do this or provide to do that and God will provide and maybe in our head we go hey I had this much owed on this electric bill and somehow I ended up with exactly that much extra in my account and we go God provided he met that need it's true he met that need but did you still have food in your cupboards did you still have uh gas in your vehicle did you still have this did you still have that God provided above your need God gave you so much more maybe it didn't look like it in the bank account cuz you paid the bill and maybe you're sitting at zero now but yet you he didn't leave you to go hungry until a few days down the road he didn't leave you to be trapped with a vehicle that didn't have the fuel to get somewhere he didn't leave you to not be able to do this or not do this we always talk about God providing our needs but yet we sometimes forget to think about the fact that he almost always goes beyond just that God wants to give us abundantly he wants to take care of us he's looking down at his children in the same way that when we are providing gifts to our children we don't give them the bare minimum the only reason we would give them the bare minimum is because that's all I got if they got the bare minimum from me it's because I just gave them every single penny that I had and there's nothing else to offer but yet that's normally when we're giving to our children we may not be giving them as much as they want or we may not be giving them every single thing that they desire but we're making sure that their needs are met and we're giving them above their needs you know their needs are make sure that they're fed make sure that they're clothed if they have any type of toys or entertainment or books we have just gone above and beyond the needs they may not have the newest and greatest they may not have the most fancy thing out there they may not have what every other kid on the block has but if they have something then they've gotten beyond the need they may not always even appreciate the above that has been given and sometimes we can run into that same place where it starts to get common to us that God has provided that God has provided above what we were looking for that God has given us that more I guarantee that the widow woman who receiv received the miracle of the oil it wasn't lost on her that she now had enough money to live on for a while it wasn't lost on her that she didn't have to go back to the creditors to borrow more money in order to buy food for the next week or to buy food for the next day it wasn't lost on her now she may have had to be Thrifty she may have had to make sure that she was shopping all the sales shopping all the discounts using coupons doing everything that she could to make this Finance stretch but yet she still knew she wasn't having to go and borrow God had provided God had met the need when God fed the 5,000 there was nobody that was sitting there at the end and going man I wish I could have eaten a little bit more if there was they could have walked up and grabbed some from the 12 baskets there was plenty of food left if somebody had been like you know I'm still just a little bit peckish I think I want just just another piece of fish or just another piece of bread they could have walked up and grabbed it it was there but God made sure to provide and provide in abundantly for the entire group to show that even at the end once again they weren't scraping the barrel they weren't scraping trying to make sure every crumb was used to get everyone fed it was there was plenty when it was done because God provides and he provides beyond what we may be expecting and he provides in ways we're not expecting I'm sure the disciples weren't expecting Jesus to multiply the food they had they were pointing out we don't have money this is all we got they were trying to convince him to send the people away they weren't trying to convince him to perform a miracle that wasn't the mindset just like if it was you know if it was your boss or if it was our pastor that was saying feed everybody I can see brother Merl coming to him going we don't got no money in the we've used up our budget there's nothing left to spend we can't that's what the disciples were doing they're going we have no funds we have no way to provide there is no option and even beyond that if they had the funds how in the world are the 12 men going to walk out there and bring back enough food for 5,000 plus so even if they said great we've got bags of money how in the world are we going to carry enough food back for them they were simply pointing out from a human standpoint this is not possible Lord we need to send them away so they can go eat we need to send them to the villages we need to send them to the towns but then another interesting concept when you look at it is if you had had 5,000 people all gathered in this would have even The Villages around had had enough food to supply for that this was not these were not big cities they were talking about they were like send them to the Villages maybe these are Villages of 100 maybe a couple hundred we got 5,000 just men we'll call it what a half again with women and children 7500 8,000 people that are here that need fed you know how many villages it's going to take to make that much food to provide this much bread or this much fish I'm sure the disciples were pointing out all of the impossibilities I'm sure they were pointing out everything you know you've got Matthew that knows about money and is probably going we don't got close to it this is how much we have this is how much we could probably buy with that you've got other people that are workers that are going you know how much a working man eats after they've been sitting here all day listening they're going to be hungry they don't want just a half loaf they want a loaf per person they want a couple loaves per person they want whatever whatever we're going to provide there are impossibilities here and then Jesus tells them what to do and to go beyond that he doesn't just provide the need he doesn't just feed the people he doesn't just feed his disciples but he provides 12 baskets of extra he provides enough that if they wanted to every disciple could have taken a basket home to their family there were 12 baskets extra let's go to Matthew chapter 15 just one chapter later Matthew chapter 15 and starting at verse 29 and Jesus departed from then and came nigh unto the Sea of Galilee and went up into a mountain and sat down there and great multitudes came unto him having with them those that were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at jesus' feet and he healed them in so much that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak and the m to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorify the god of Israel then Jesus called his disciples unto him and said I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and I will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the way and his disciples say unto him when should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude stop there a second one chapter ago I have no idea what actual timeline is in the Bible it looks really short it was less than a page one page ago God just fed 5,000 and there were 12 baskets and yet here we are same situation and the disciples are going again how do we provide food for them you would think that at least one of them would have been like Lord are you going to multiply food again are you going to are you going to make all the food you would think one of them would have said this you would think at least one of them was thinking it surely somebody in the group maybe they weren't bold enough to say it but surely there was one of them going do I get to see it again do I get to see it happen again one more time and Jesus Jesus saith unto him how many loaves have ye and they said seven and a few little fishes and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground and he took the seven Loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and break them and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full and they that did eat were 4,000 men besides women and children Jesus does it again and again he makes sure that there is excess he doesn't go okay I gave excess last time this time we'll just make sure everybody's fed and that's good enough it's like no we're going to go ahead and this time we'll do seven because seven is completion we'll have seven baskets extra to show that I completed the work I did it all everyone was fed everyone was filled here's the bonus I have met the need and I've provided a little bit extra now there's nothing in the scripture that says how big these baskets are I don't know if we're talking a basket like this hey there were seven extra baskets or there were 12 extra baskets I don't know if we're talking about the laundry basket you have at home full of food I don't know what size basket we're talking about but this was more than like a teacup this was a sizable amount I mean if we heaped one of these full that's a decent amount of bread and food in it make it seven of those make it 12 of those that's a decent amount of food you make it a clothes basket or a laundry basket that's a lot of food now it may not be a lot when you look at how many were fed even 12 clothes baskets of food compared to 7,000 to 8,000 people that's not a lot of food it wouldn't go very far but it shows there was a lot extra and this time we have the seven baskets and it's the same thing God has provided he has met the need he's taken care of all those that were Desiring to be fed they were Desiring to be fed both spiritually and physically because they had been there three days they were starting to get hungry and God made sure to meet all their needs and then he went above and beyond he made sure that they were all fed and then there was some excess and you know I'm one of those I always look at it and go what did they do with all this did they take it and just give it to some of the neighboring villages to go here's some extra food feed whoever's hungry did they take it with them and that was their food on the journey for a while did they I don't know I guarantee they didn't just leave it behind a waste because Jesus told them to collect the extra into a basket so he wasn't saying leave the food on the ground for the birds so it was used for something scriptures don't tell us what but it was used for something and so God provided and then he went beyond and God does the same thing in our lives God has promised you know if go God promised us our Salvation if that was everything he did for us us in our entire lives we would have no right to complain if all we got was salvation then we got the good end of the deal but yet God instead goes through the scriptures and gives us promise after promise after promise no I'm going to be your healer no I'm going to be your standard no I'm going to be the one that fights your battles for you no I'm going to be the one that does this I'm going to do this I'm not just going to be your salvation that gives you life after death I'm going to give you all the things else I'm going to give you the promise that I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor the seed begging for bread I'm going to make sure that you're provided for I'm going to make sure that you're taken care of I'm going to make sure that the needs are met I'm going to make sure that at least a few of your wants are met no you may never be rich like I said this isn't some Prosperity Gospel where man if you just if you give in $5 will give you back 10 you give in this much God will give you double all no we don't do that but we do have a loving God that is generous and he wants to provide he wants to meet our needs he wants to provide he wants to take care of he wants to love on his children he wants to love on his bride how often for all the husbands in here how often do you buy your wife something special that you know she wants that has nothing to do with needs but she mentioned at some point hey I really like this coffee cup or I really like this dress or I really like this decorative piece that goes in the house or whatever or maybe it's just cuz you know hey I know my wife likes chocolate so so I better make sure to bring chocolate home now and then maybe your wife likes flowers and so you make sure to bring home flowers every now and then or she likes this or she likes that it's not a need it's not a requirement there are things that if necessary she could do without but yet as the loving husband you're going I want to give this to her I want to give her a little bit more than the needs I want to give her some of the things that she enjoys I want to give her some of the things that matter to her Beyond just we've got a house to live in we've got food on the table we've got the necessities and if the same way that Jesus talked about if you as a mortal man can give good gifts how much more can Our Father in Heaven how much more does he look at us and go I'm going to meet your needs but I want to do more than that yes he's not promising that we're all going to be millionaires with huge mansions and servants taking care of everything and this that and the other but he is promising that he's going to take care of us he is promising that he's going to meet the needs and he is promising that he can do more Amen in the Old Testament you had hundred that were fed and then there was excess in the New Testament you have two different times one time that has 5,000 plus another time that has 4,000 plus and each time there's leftover each time there's more than what is required to take care of them Psalms 23 and: 5 thou preparest a table before me in the presence of I mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over he doesn't give us a cup that's filled halfway he doesn't give us a cup that there's barely enough to take one Sip and it's empty he keeps pouring and he fills until the cup is overflowing he provides he meets our needs he makes sure that we have both what we need and a little more because he's a good god a loving God a caring God he cares about his children he cares about his bride Psalm chapter 34 starting at verse 9 oh fear the lord ye his Saints for there is no want to them that fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing so what that tells me there something that we are wanting first question is is it really a good thing if I'm sitting there and it's been an extended period of me wanting and probably in my mind going I need this is it really a need and is it a good thing because the scripture says th shall not want for any good thing now how often do we as people desire something that probably isn't a good thing it may not necessarily be an evil thing but it may not be the good thing that we should be longing for that we should be Desiring because God promises he'll provide every good thing he'll provide what we have need of he'll provide to take care of us Luke 6:38 this is the verse that Prosperity Gospel loves but I couldn't ignore it so give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again I'm always one that repeats myself to make sure people catch what I'm trying to say and once again I am not preaching a Prosperity Gospel in any way I am not saying give this money to the church or give this money to me or give this money to brother Wendell and the Lord will blow up everything you've got to give you so much more no but we do serve a God that provides so much we've heard the testimonies In This Very church building of different brothers that they didn't have the money to put gas in their vehicle and yet somehow it kept going and kept going and kept going or they even watched the needle go to full as they're driving past the gas station they weren't stopping and pumping but it filled up on its own we've heard about miracles I remember one when I was so much younger I was a kid I remember my dad talking about it and I believe it was over in India that there was a pot of rice in this one town and it was like all the food they had and the pot kept refilling every time they brothers and sisters from this church would come and they would get their portion to eat it kept refilling it kept Rene it kept multiplying and everyone was provided for everyone was able to eat in a time when they shouldn't have been able to when they didn't have the finances or they didn't have the food around to even go buy or whatever the situation was I was a kid so I don't remember the exact details I remember that part though and I remember my dad talking about it and talking about that testimony of this pot of rice that didn't go down that didn't go away we serve a God that provides we serve a God that provides in ways that we do not expect in ways that we do not understand and we serve a God that provides Beyond just the very basic need and sometimes we begin to take that part for granted like I said we'll come up and we'll praise the Lord that we got this much to pay that bill cuz that's what we were looking for and forget about the fact that God had also provided food on the in our cupboards and had provided gas in the car provided this or that so we had more than just the need we may not have had more dollars than the need but we had more or you'll have a time when maybe you're struggling financially but yet you're watching and all the neighbors kids or all the other church kids have been getting sick and having to go to the doctor for stuff you don't have the money to take your kids to the doctor and yet they're staying healthy they haven't gotten sick they haven't had any problems and do we always remember to thank God for our health during those times go Lord thank you so much I haven't had to go to the doctor I haven't money's tight but I haven't had to miss work my kids haven't had to go to the doctor I haven't had to go buy any medicine for them or do this or that they've stayed healthy through the midst of cold season or through the midst of whatever and that's not necessarily a major Miracle but at the same time you're going thank you for the little extra Lord thank you for that cup that overflowed a little bit went into the saucer to give me just that that little bit extra now Lord I know that you could have provided if I needed to go to the doctor you could have provided a way to pay the bill you could have provided to take care of it you could have healed on your own so that I didn't even need to go to the doctor but Lord thank you that you kept them healthy so that I didn't have to do any of those things thank you that we were able to do this thank you that we're able to do that because God provides more than just our needs he goes above and beyond we have the excess we have the abundance amen Matthew chapter 6 and verse 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than rment behold the fowls of the air for they sew not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father Feth them are you not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature and why take you thought for rment consider the lies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not AR raid like unto one of these wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the tomorrow for the marrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof God's promise seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and then all these things shall be added unto you no God doesn't say we're going to be millionaires no God doesn't say we're going to be wealthy no God doesn't say that we're going to have so much of extra but he does say that he's going to provide he says if you seek after me first I'll make sure that your needs are met I'll make sure that you're provided for God is it's one of those where just what God does can just make you smile because it's not just that he provides the needs but he goes that little bit extra it's like that cherry on top of the Sunday I could eat the Sunday without the Cherry you could eat the Sunday without you could eat just the ice cream you don't need the whipped cream and the cherry and whatever else and you'd be very happy at least I would you give me a bowl of ice cream I'm good but you put the extra on it and it's just a little bit better just that that little bit extra on top of it and how often in our lives does God give us those little extra blessings it's like in the story of Esther where they were instructed to drop the handfuls of purpose for her she was already gleaning she was already getting enough she was going to have food to take home but yet Bo as instructed drop a little extra give her some abundance make sure that there's more than she might expect make sure to give her that little something extra so that's going to make her eyes sparkle a little bit make her just smile and joyful because she ended up with more it's like I talked about earlier that what husbands will do for their wives you can just see God sometimes looking down on us and going I'm going to give him just a little little extra blessing right there and maybe it's not in the Physical Realm maybe it's you know what I think this is the service that brother Donald needs a little extra touch in service I'm going to give him a little something extra He's been Faithful he's been doing everything he should but I'm was going to give him just that little extra handful of purpose today I'm going to reach down and I'm going to touch brother Mitch you know he may have been struggling with finances or with his body or with whatever but I'm going to give him a little something extra in the spiritual realm I'm going to give him a little extra courage a little extra peace a little extra faith and no it won't show up in his bank account no it won't show up in his cupboard or show up in this place but he's going to know he got it he's going to have he's going to he's going to walk out knowing that he had that little special service that little special moment we know that God can give us the extra blessings in the Physical Realm because he does it time and time again but how often does he minister to us on the spiritual side and he's giving us those little extra blessings like I said if all God had given us us was our salvation and he never offered another thing we still got the good deal if that was it if we had to suffer through the rest of our life just knowing I've been redeemed we are still on the upside Hallelujah but yet we have a God that looks at us and he pays the price to redeem us and then he still goes you know what I want to have a relationship I want to talk to them I want to minister to them I want to be their healer I want to be their Confidant I want to be everything that they need I want to provide every single thing I want to provide more than what they need I want to give them those little bits of extra I want to drop those handfuls of purpose I want to spill that cup to overflowing sometimes sure there are times in our lives we go through when maybe the cup got spilled a little bit and maybe for a season I'm going through with a cup that's only half full or 3/4 full but God is sitting there waiting to refill it again he is waiting to fill it to overflowing he is waiting to minister to us again and to provide more than what we're asking for and to provide more than what we would call our need s God is not a God that does anything halfway he is not a God that goes I'm going to hit a just that precise and that's it nothing more God is a God that wants to give us the blessings that wants to provide amen but sometimes we have to work on ourselves to be able to notice those blessings sometimes like I spoke this morning we can kind of get used to things around us and so we get used to the idea of there's food in the cabinet we don't necessarily think it of as the extra blessing yet if we go to other parts of the world they would consider that huge but we live in America the Land of Plenty so food in our cupboard is not necessarily the extra blessing we think of but yet it can I mean h how many of us in our cupboard have a box of something or a can of something that has been there for who knows how long and it's edible but yet we don't necessarily like it and so it just stays in there we've got and you know it's somehow we accidentally bought it or someone gave it to us or maybe it came with the house I don't know which one but there's something in that cupboard that has been there for years or at least months and you're like you know you go to cook your meal and you look up there like ah I really should use that sometime not tonight but I'll get to it eventually and I'm sure for each one of us it's a different ingredient but all of us have something there and it's excess it's extra none of us have gotten to the point where we're going man I either eat that or I'm starving there is no other option because God Is providing he's giving us Beyond The Bare Necessities he's giving us more brother brandham says in the sermon Jehovah Dr he says how am I going to do it brother brandom I've been through prayer lines I've done this I've done that how can I do it God will provide how are you going to get by with this you're saying like that you know you're making yourself targets but God will provide that's all how you know when you stand on the platform this God will provide that's all I know he promised it we take his word we believe it that settles it that's all walk away from it cuz God said so that's it that's just got to be that way God will provide and God has proven time and time again that he doesn't provide just the bare minimum I'm not going to say that never once in life are we going to hit a point where God gives us the bare minimum I'm not saying that it's impossible that that will happen but I am saying that in general through our lives if we look God has given us a lot more than the bare minimum almost our entire lives for most of us probably I could say our entire life and be accurate I know for me I can say that that I have if I really think about it I have never been at the point where I only had the bare minimum there have been plenty of times when I had less than I might have wanted plenty of times where I had less then I really thought I needed but I can never say that no that was the bare minimum we were eating the last thing in the cupboard we were there was no money in the bank we had no gas in the car we had no whatever we had we were on the last legs but I'm not going to say that could never happen but I will say for most of our lives that doesn't happen because for most of our Lives God Is providing and he gives us those little extra little extra pieces that little extra provision it's just us remembering to notice it it's us remembering to be thankful for the little extra to be thankful for that box or can that is in the cupboard that we haven't eaten in months CU we just don't like that thing but yet it's there because we have food and we live in a time when we can be a little bit choosy about our food we have that much extra in the sermon Abraham brother brandom says no matter what it is the Lamb was there he provided a lamb when it needed a lamb when you're sick and needs healing he will provide for you if you need salvation he provides for you if you need a Revival he will provide for you if the meal Barrel is empty he will provide for you amen if you're all downhearted and drooped over God will provide for you for he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed amen the Lord's provided sacrifice the Lord's provided lamb we serve a God that provides we serve a God that that meets our needs and that goes beyond that and this is just one of those times when I think all I'm doing tonight is just reminding us to be thankful for the little bits of extra we get just reminding us to be thankful for that little extra food in the cupboard or the little extra money that's in the bank or the little extra touch that you got in service or the little extra touch that you got in your prayer closet doesn't have to be here in church maybe the Lord met you in your prayer closet maybe the Lord met you while you were you one of your sisters while you were going around the house singing Praise songs and cleaning and the Lord came down and touched you just a little bit and gave you something a little extra maybe it was in the moment you didn't expect because in all these different situations I think that we can go normally the people were not expecting for it to be Prov divided the way that it was people weren't going in looking for every one of these situations to happen the woman didn't come looking for all this oil to sell she came probably expecting the prophet to go talk to the creditors that's what she was looking for the disciples didn't come to Jesus expecting him to feed the multitude they were expecting him to send them away so they could go go get their own food yes the servant didn't expect the food to multiply to feed the H hundred men he thought Elisha would send at least some of them away they weren't expecting for God to provide the way that he did they weren't expecting for this to happen the children of Israel as they were in the wilderness looking for food weren't expecting Moses to promise bread to fall from the sky or bread to suddenly appear on the ground they weren't expecting the Mana to be offered but yet this was the way that God provided this was the way that God chose to do it Elijah probably wasn't expecting to be sent down to this town to live with a widow woman and her son but yet that was how God provided that was the route he chose and in every one of these situations God provided more than just enough but he provided it in his way and in his time and that's the part that confuses us most of the time even with the little extra blessings is it doesn't necessarily come the way we expect and it doesn't come in the manner that maybe we wanted it to come and so we lose sight of it but it doesn't change the fact the fact that God's providing and that God is giving us more than just the bare minimum through the Wilderness they come the journey heartaches and Sorrows as they pass through Moses got old 120 years old and one day he was going to die so he climbed up to the town to the top of Mount pisca And while he was up there viewing the promised land death struck him that faithful prophet of God when there never been one lived like him but death struck him and when struck him he needed a place that he could die God provided a rock that same rock that had followed him through the Wilderness he climbed up on the Rock and died then he needed Paul Bears to bury him and God provided angels and they came and packed him away somewhere what was it God if we'll walk in God's provided way God will provide everything we have need of God provides no matter what the circumstance is he provides and the sermon be not afraid but therefore see when the Lord wants me to go overseas say how do you do that somehow another somebody comes and gives me the money to go and so and if I have to go to a little place I ain't under no obligation but what I can go so I just where he wants me to go he takes care of me and I just live by faith and walk by faith and where he whatever whatever he wants me to do anything he always provides a way brother brandom's just talking about his own Ministry and he says how do I go overseas God provides he didn't say I have this big collection agency I have this bank account that we put this much of your offering in every time or do this that or the other he said God inspires somebody to give me the money when I need to go it may not be there the day before but when it's time to go God provides the money and God does the same thing in our lives when something needs to happen happen God will provide What It Takes he's not telling us to go sit on a hill and never work another day in our life we're still supposed to be doing what we're supposed to do but if there's something God will provide God had provided me with the van that we have and we'd only had it for a few months and suddenly there was all this engine trouble going on with it and it was something where they were going to have to tear up the the engine and replace a head and do all this other stuff and it was going to be expensive i' only had the van a month or two and I definitely didn't have the money for that that's not a cheap repair and I was trying to figure out how in the world am I going to pay for this I've got to have a vehicle to get to church and I remember that was part of my prayer was going Lord you brought me to Oklahoma and Lord you know that I need to get to church and I believe you brought me here not just for church but also to be able to go there to fellowship and to participated and be part of the body not just to only show up on Sunday or on Wednesday so Lord I got to have a vehicle that runs you know it's like to get to work technically I could probably get on a bike and get to work at home it's a little longer bike ride than I want to take but I could it there's a bus that runs in Still Water I could get tickets and take the bus and get to work and get home the bus stops actually right outside my neighborhood and there's a bus stop right beside Chick-fil-A I could take the bus so for work and providing those parts I don't have to have a car but if God wanted me to attend church here in py where I believed I was supposed to be at then I had to have a vehicle and I couldn't see how I was going to be able to provide for that vehicle and so we went to the dealership to have him look at it figure out how much it was going to cost and talking to the guy that was in charge of the maintenance we were like I know this is out of warranty but yet I know that there was a vehicle like the year before that had a recall for the same issue is there any chance they could be somehow related and maybe dodge manufacturing would cover this and the guy said I highly doubt it he said if this had happened a month ago maybe but the guy who works for Dodge that I correspond with just got replaced so the new guy there I don't have a relationship with there's nothing where I can try to pull any strings to get anything gone and because it's out of warranty it's probably going to be a no but I'll put in their requests just to see just to see what happens and God provided Dodge said if they pay for the parts we'll pay for all the labor the parts were the cheap part the labor was where it was really going to hit because it was not a quick easy repair this was hours and hours at least on the labor bill I didn't do the work so I don't know exactly how long but on the labor Bill there was a lot of hours of work and I could afford the parts I had that much in my account I could pay that bill and God provided God took care of it but it was holding on to the promise going Lord you you've told me to be at church when the doors are open I believe you've called me to Oklahoma I believe this is where I'm supposed to be I believe this is the church I'm supposed to be attending I believe this is where you've called me to bring my children and so Lord you have to be the one to provide I remember there were times in the first year that we moved here where with all the different activities that were going on over here I was trying to figure out if I can afford gas to get over here that many times a week I wasn't used to spending that much on gas this was not my normal expenses and then I moved here and suddenly my gas bill went going up a lot higher and I was like all right Lord I believe that you called me to be here to be part of this church and like I said that meant more than just being here Sunday and Wednesday now it didn't mean that I made it to every single birthday event or every single whatever but it meant that I made it to at least some of them to be part of the body to be part of what was going on and I would bring it before the Lord and I would pray about it I would go all right Lord I'm trusting you that you're going to give me the finances I need to have the gas to get there you know that that was our desire that was the reason we mooved to Oklahoma was to be part of this kind of assembly and then I would get a raise at work or maybe I would get the opportunity to work a few more hours a week wasn't that I was suddenly doing 60 to 80 hours a week or anything but hey I got an extra one to two hours of overtime this week or I got an extra this out of the other hey I got a dollar raise and none of this was suddenly making any work man I'm wealthy I have so much money but yet the needs were met God provided God made sure that I had more than just the needs because the bare need is brother brandom said be there every time the doors open he didn't say be at every fellowship if there's that quote I haven't seen it yet you're welcome to show it to me I know the quote be there every time the doors open but yet there was that desire there was that goal that we want our kids to be part of this we want ourselves to be part of this we want to be part of this body and so Lord you have to be the one to provide you have to be the one to meet a little more than just the need you have to be the one to give that little bit of excess and be not afraid it is I he says and now don't watch for miracles don't tell God the way you want it just accept the way he gives it to you you just take a hold of his promise and hold it now that's been my purpose that's been what I've been trying to lay before this church here in Santa Maria is to accept him just by believing his word and action see the presence and manifestation of Christ and then except not only healing but every promise he give for the holy spirit for anything accept it upon the basis that his presence is here to vindicate his promise now brother brandom doesn't say there will be no Miracles but he says don't just sit there only watching for miracles he said you accept it however God gives it maybe God used a miraculous way to do it maybe he gave a miraculous healing maybe he had your gas tank go from empty to full as you drove by a gas station maybe he used a miracle maybe he went and he just gave you an extra hour or two at work maybe he just went and gave you the little bit of extra that you needed in that moment in that season and I most of us aren't going to say I got an extra two hours at work this week that's a miracle we're not going to classify that as a miracle but brother random says don't look for miracles he doesn't say ignore Miracles but he says accept the way God gives it to you he said grab hold of the promise and hold on to that and then just wait and see how God brings it about like I said the widow woman wasn't expecting her oil to be multiplied she probably expected the prophet to go talk to the creditors she didn't the they didn't expect the bread and fish to be multiplied for the multitude they didn't expect God to do this way or to do it that way Elijah to start off he probably didn't expect a raven to show up with his food we can go back into the verses that I didn't read yet Elijah was probably a little shocked the First Time The Raven showed up he's taking a nap then there are these birds showing up dropping bread and fish in front of him or bread and flesh he probably didn't expect this but then he got used to it and that was the normal and so then he did expect it and then God switches and go no I want you to go down and live with this widow woman she's going to provide he probably didn't expect that either the widow woman didn't expect some strange man to come walking up to her and say fix me a cake first she expected to die God doesn't very often work the way we expect but yet God doesn't God just calls us to hold on to the promise and accept however he does it hold on to the promise that God gives us hold on to the promise and God promises he'll provide God promises that he'll meet the need and God promises that he'll give a little bit more because that's what he's shown time and time again both through the scriptures and our own lives that he doesn't just provide the bare necessity he provides in abundance as the musicians go ahead and come now every word of God is the seed of God and it'll produce just exactly what the Bible says it is if you need salvation take the seed of God come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden if you need healing I'm the Lord that Health thee anything you have need of it's a promise in this Bible God will take care of every promise and listen to this I say this reverently quietly so you can remember what God will do the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you'll take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise it will bring it to pass sister if you would mind playing great is thy faithfulness the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass the promises are there and the prophet tells us to grab hold of them to grab hold on the promise and then just wait for God to fulfill it but he tells us not to go into it with a presupposed idea of how God is going to fulfill it but to go in just expecting that God will fulfill it God will provide God will meet the need God will take care of [Music] everything we serve a God that supplies all of our need we s serve a God that's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think he's able to do so much more than we might expect he's able to go above what we're looking for and he shows time and time again that he's a God that loves to drop those little bits of extra to drop those handfuls of purpose sometimes they're going to be in the Physical Realm sometimes maybe it's he gave you an unexpected bonus at work or maybe it's he gave you this blessing or that blessing provided to make sure a bill was taken care of or provided to make sure that this need was met or that need was met but so often it's also providing for us spiritually to meet the needs that are going in our hearts to answer questions that we have that are rolling around or maybe it's just for us to be able to feel his love and presence that maybe we haven't felt for a little while that we're able to walk away and we're able to go God has given me just a little bit more than normal God has given me a little something special God has given me a little bit extra in this moment we serve a god of abundance we serve a God that has the cattle on a thousand hills he's not a God that's scraping the bottom of the barrel to try to make sure that we have what we need he's able to provide he's able to provide beyond what we ask or think provide beyond what just the need is we have to work on ourselves to just be at the point where we recognize what he does that we recognize those little extra blessings that we can express our thankfulness to him that we can express that thankfulness I'll be the first one to say when my wife notices that little extra something that I did and she thanks me for it it makes me feel like I am 10t tall that I have succeeded I have impressed my wife in some way it's a good day and God likes to hear the thankfulness from his children and from his bride as well to know that hey they've noticed some of these little extras that I've given them they've noticed some of these little extra blessings that I've dropped off to them they've noticed some of the little extra things that I've provided and they're not just taking it for granted we have a world around us that they're all struggling and clawing and doing their best to grab every single thing that they can get I have to have the newest phone I have to have the most upto-date computer or gaming system or car or house or put in whatever it is that pops in your head but God comes and he says no I'll meet your needs I'll provide for you and I'll show you time and time again where I give you a little bit more I give you a little bit extra blessing so I don't know what needs each one of us have in our lives what we're sitting there and thinking about that I know that we have some different ones that are struggling with a need for healing in their bodies I know some different ones that maybe are struggling financially or struggling with this are struggling with [Music] that we still serve a God that can provide we still serve a God that can meet every single need we have to grab hold of those promises and hold on to them just like the prophet told us we have to hold on to those promises and we have to be willing to accept them in the way that God gives them we can't go in with our own expectations of well I know God's going to provide through this method he's going to provide this way he could but probably not God doesn't normally do it the way that we think it should happen God doesn't normally do it the way that we think is logical God does it his way to show that he's in control and to show that it's through his power and through his grace and his Mercy ultimately everything comes back to us just being thankful that we serve such a loving God that we serve a God that cares about our needs to serve a God that cares about a lot of our wants and provides those as well because he's showing over and over again his love for us and his care for for us we aren't children that are left behind or tossed to the side we are to use the Expression we're the apple of his eye we're the one that he's chosen he's desired he's called out and he loves us and he takes care of us Beyond even what we realize so often sister keys if you would put up the lyrics for Great Is Thy [Music] Faithfulness Great Is Thy
