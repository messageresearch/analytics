praise is Du I stand in all of you amen you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight and you come under an expectation to hear from the Lord I trust you've had a a good day today I know like brother Merl said we might be weary and body but strong in spirit and I believe if we're willing to press through tonight the Lord can speak to Heart speak to needs whatever our desire is amen well if you would have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to Ephesians 2 and 4 amen it is good to be back home I know we've been home a couple services but it's it's good to be back home there's no place like home that's for sure you hear you hear it said a lot by ministers that their favorite places to preach is at home and that's true for me I always enjoy preaching at home and so it is it's good to be here tonight and Lord willing on Sunday evening I'm going to do a mission report of my trip in Nicaragua I know there's a few that's always asking about trips and so I apologize for not doing that more often but Lord willing I'll I'll try to give a small report on Sunday just to show a few pictures and things and I know I appreciate y'all's prayers and y'all support as we do travel and things but Ephesians 2 and 4 but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherein he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and ra raised us up together and has made us set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen can we bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an honor it is God to come into your house Lord God may we never take it lightly father that we have this opportunity Lord a place where we can come in a freedom of worship Lord and just to lay aside our trials and our troubles Lord but God as we come to this part of the service we ask that you would just just feel welcome among us tonight Lord you see the simple thought you've placed upon My Heart Lord may it be an encouragement in some way and strengthen and edify father Lord we just commit the service into your hands in jesus' name amen you may be seated tonight and this is just a simple subject but while I was in Nicaragua um the Lord sort of G gave me this here as I was ministering there so I hope hope it' be okay if I just preach some of it tonight but it would be on atmosphere and brother Brandon would say in perfect faith and I've read it here before but it's a powerful quote he would say but Jesus lived in a world that no one knew about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian that's what we are we'd be Mystic to the world the people don't understand you you walk in the spirit what what the spirit say you would do what it forbid you would not do then the people begin to say you'd be a Mystic person then that's the way it is with all believers they're a Mystic they're Mystic people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves and Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples didn't understand him when he spoke to them they said that what are you talking in riddles we don't understand this how can it be see there wasn't in the world that he lived in they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him and when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ then now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into a rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor or the deacons or trustees that means for the leoty every individual walks in the world alone with God you're baptized into the kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God see he gives the orders you pack them out whatever he says there's no Shadow of Doubt anywhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails and I thought that was so powerful that we walk in a world isolated uh from everybody else but it's just you and God and brother Brandon and I love it how he's putting it that we're walking by substance faith it ain't an intellectual faith it ain't something mind over matter but it's a substance that that that a revelation has given you and it's and this place is only for the bride because brother Brandon would tell us that we're getting into bride material now that's what separates us I believe from the church world and you as the bride of Christ is we've been called into Heavenly places I I believe we've been called into an atmosphere where you're alone with God and I think it's pretty incredible how brother brand is putting it that we've been invited into a place that not even the disciples could go into he says when Jesus would speak even though it was in their language it was in riddles you know so even though it was confusing to the disciples Jesus had perfect understanding of who he was where he was the uh uh uh the the what he was to perform what he was to produced so in this other world that Jesus was walking in the mystery was was clear it wasn't confusion it wasn't you know he knew what his position was and with Jesus knowing who he was he knew that there was potential that laid inside of him that he was to produce cuz you know what what is a thought it's a it's potentially a word but in order for that potential to be expressed it's got to go from a thought to a word and what is a word it's an action in potential form you know so once the word was written then those potentials could be manifested then the word would come inside of Jesus then those potentials would no longer be a thought no longer a word but now it is an action so Jesus knew that he was on the earth with potentials and he had to produce these things and before Isaiah would say a virgin shall conceive it was in the mind of God then whenever he would say that it would come into word form but there had to be a body that would take the word and produce the potentials of it and so by Jesus knowing who he was he knew what he was to produce and brother Brandon would say this now no to see by it when he stood and said if you destroy this body this Temple I'll raise it again in 3 days why he was just as satisfied that he would do it because the scripture says he would do it the Messiah I'll not leave a soul in Hell neither will I leave my my Holy One to see corruption a prophet who the word comes to had said that that would happen and he knew who he was that person and I thought that was powerful whenever I read that because here is deity Jesus Christ was pointing back to a prophet with with Fallen uh with a fallen nature with with with human mistakes you know but he was pointing back to that prophet's word and says I am the potential I am the manifestation of that prophet's word and I thought that's what we are to do in this generation Jesus was our example that would say search the scriptures and in them testify of who I am there was no condemnation against him that he had found his position and I believe we can be satisfied in knowing that we are who Malachi 4 was talking about we are the one that the message has come to to produce the life in this generation Luke 4:18 would say the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised and so Jesus was just picking up prophecy and acting it out and and I think I think what is so incredible is brother Brandon would tell us that Jesus would not quote all of that prophecy he would only do half of it then would stop and would say this day the scripture is fulfilled brother Brandon would tell us why that it it was not time for that scripture to be fulfilled the second part of that scripture was concerning is his second coming so you can look at the discernment that Jesus would have he would look at the word and and would discern that this is the alloted portion for this time and I believe that the bride has got a discernment that we can look at the word and see what is my portion to produce you see Jesus knew that this ain't the time for that to be produced yet you know and I believe that we can look at the scripture and find yourself in the book and say this is what I'm to produce I'm not producing this you see if you find that you're the bride of Christ you're no longer worrying if you're serpen SE right if you find that you're the bride of Christ and you're going to make a Rapture you're no longer worried if you're a tribulation Saint it's discernment in the word of God that is found your position and then you act upon it and you let those potentials just start to manifest itself and brother Brandon would say whatever he said God honored what he said think of that Jesus said and God brought brought it to pass so he knew that his words were God's words now look that same scripture comes back to us again if you say to this mountain oh my just let that soak just a little bit and so that same thing applies to us Jesus knew if he was in the will of God his words was the same as deity himself and the same thing with the bride of Christ when you get in the will of God for your life you know what you speak is what the spirit is saying you see your your confession is not different than the word of God but what the word says you say it and then your word is the same as God himself because we're not twisting the word we're not adding our own ideas or our own opinions but our confession is the same as the word has been brought to us oh Hallelujah and so we have uh faith in who we are and and brother Brandon would say no one can do anything unless you know what you're doing and you got to know your position so once you know what you're doing and what you to produce then there is a faith that puts you into action and brother Brandon would talk about Potentials in in in the Easter seal he would talk about it a lot and he would say that we've had a resurrection now and since we have one now if we go by the way of the Grave we can have one then you see we've potentially already raised up again and if we go by the way of the Grave The Same Spirit that has quickened us now is going to bring them back out of the grave and I believe that the word is a seed it's potentials but the same spirit that has quickened us and has brought us to Life The Same Spirit whenever the word comes across the pulpit or comes across the tape player that same Spirit can grab it grab that seed grab that potential and bring it into manifestation where we're not just dead church members we're not just layer of sin walking around in confusion but the same God that has refilled us with the Holy Ghost and brought his life on the inside is picking up the word and bringing it into manifestation and you see brother Brandon would say my brother my sister let me say to you this is in Godly fear knowing that I may never live to see anter again but there was one thing sure when a genuine for ordained Son of God by the word of God hears the voice of God he'll raise up and go to meet it's the potentials that's he that he is going to meet the Living Word as he as he was the bride will meet the groom she is a part of his body talking about if you go by the way of the Grave he says as sure as you're a predestinated Son of God he's going to rise again because there are potentials laying there and I believe in every one of our life are potentials I don't believe God has called us to be a potentially the bride of Christ or or potentially an overcomer but God has called us to put it into manifestation and you can look at the the little Eagle that was in the Barnard he was always an eagle but he the potentials was laying there all the time even though he was walking around with the chickens and eating like the chickens all he needed was Mama's voice to come and bring out the potentials that was laying there and to bring an identity to him that was there all along and I'm so thankful that we would have a message even when we was in confusion and and and and in chaos the word would come over our life and let us know our true identity that there were potentials laying on the inside of us to be an overcomer to to be the bride of Christ to make a Rapture and to see a body change you see it's getting in the right atmosphere the word of God coming and bringing forth the life of the word oh my brother Brandon would say now to you that's here and that that's needing needing of healing in your body how many Believers are here raise your hand I'm a Believer as far as I know in my heart how many possesses it you know beyond the shadow of a doubt that is that's in your heart right now you've been raised from the dead you know it oh my what could happen in a meeting like this then I know I'm late but what could happen right now just think of what could take place face the potentials are laying right in you now ain't that powerful so if you're needing healing the potentials is in you right now but the brand must say the Rapture is in you right now so the potentials of everything is laying inside of you but you need the right atmosphere you see that's why we don't need just some dead theology or or some psychologist to come by and look over us we need an atmosphere that the word of God can fall into and bring forth the life not just at church but at home at school at the job site wherever we are we're leaving in a constant atmosphere that the life of God is constantly being produced oh Hallelujah you see and that should change the way we act that should change the change the way we think of things and and think of how H how we should live if we know that all of the potentials is already in us that should change the way react knowing that somebody's not going to come with a magic wand but I've got something to do you see God has given us his word and his Spirit what what else can God do you know we need to get into get into action the God has given me everything that I need but let me get in the right atmosphere and you see brother Brandon would tell us in in the message parting the church ought to be in million miles up the road and Christ is waiting for for the church just to get ready and you see so the potentials are laying there but we've got something to do you see brother Brandon would tell us that God loves sincerity and he says the reason that the church world is in that condition is because they've lost their sincerity and that really really spoke to my heart as I was reading that cuz brother brandom says they'll they'll come to the church and they'll be chewing bubblegum you know they'll come to the Altar and they're laughing and snickering and and they're hitting one another so even though they're coming inside of a building they're not getting into the atmosphere and you see brother Brandon with would preach in perseverance he would say many people think that once you get to a meeting where Jesus is at the fight is over he talks about the the woman that that that Jesus called her a dog he says once he once she got into the atmosphere of Jesus once what once he she got into his presence she did not stop fighting there he says Jesus looked at her and says you're a dog and she didn't get discouraged but she stopped and she said that is true but even the dogs get get the crumbs brother brandom says many of us cannot get humble enough just to get the crumbs he says too many people think that just getting to the meeting is all you have to do but you still have to persevere you still have to enter in you see it takes sincerity to say God I'm needing something from you not just coming and hearing a A good sermon or or reading a church age book on on a Wednesday night but let me come in sincerity so that the word can be brought into manifestation you look at Titus 2 and6 uh the Apostle Paul would tell a young men likewise exort to be sober minded in all things showing thyself a good pattern of Good Works in Doctrine showing UNC corruptness gravity and sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of a con the contrary parts may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you so that's what sincerity does it brings the potentials out of your heart into manifestation but not even the sinner can bring condemnation against you and that is bringing uh making them ashamed is your life because of sincerity and the Apostle Paul is telling us once you get sincerity it's going to affect your speech the way you talk is going to be different the way you live is going to be different what it is is pulling out the potentials that is already laying there and you brother Brandon would talk about zakus and would say sometimes God gets a man to do the ridiculous to see how determined he is to get to Jesus and you know and it's a kid story but he would say zakus he would could not get to Jesus so what he would do is get a trash can and push that trash can up to a tree he says he was doing the ridiculous because he was determined oh my and he and he says how sincere are you to do the ridiculous to get to Jesus so if we really know that the potentials are laying there we'll do whatever it takes to get into the right atmosphere for it to become manifestation if I have to crawl through the dirt or or get on a trash can like zakus I'm going to do whatever it takes to get into the presence of Jesus Christ if I have to get past bitterness get past discouragement whatever it takes I want to get into the right atmosphere so that the Life of Christ can be manifested through my life Hallelujah brother Brandon would say and Men through all ages that's ever tried to achieve something has been persistent man in order to be persistent is to know what you are after and if you do not know you're not certain of where you're standing but when you thoroughly understand what it is and what you're after and are satisfied you're going to get it then you can be persistent I thought that's pretty pretty pretty incredible he says man in order to be persistent you have to know what you are after cuz if you don't know what you're after and if you don't know if you can get it or not there's no point in trying right you know it's like losing weight you know if it's it's in the mind if you truly believe that you can lose weight you're going to jump in and start to do it right but usually that first week you're struggling you're hungry then all of a sudden you tap out mentally right CU you don't think it's possible but even though it's possible your perseverance is going away because you don't think you can do it and brother brandom is saying in order to be perseverant you got to know you can get what you're after you see so if you're looking for Joy or peace you got to know that it's something you can achieve if you want a Revival in your home it's got to be something you know that you can achieve if you want Revival in the church and and your children on fire it's got to be something you know that you can reach and I believe this message has brought to us whatever we or whatever God leads our souls to believe we can have it so if our souls is believing and expecting for a Revival press for it don't give up when you're tired don't give up when you're weary don't give up if it don't happen after the first week but if your soul is looking for something be persevering get in the right atmosphere and say God bring out the potentials I want my children on fire I want my home life on fire I want the power of God in my church like never before if you think you can have it keep fighting for it oh you've got something to do you bring the atmosphere brother the brandom says we're miniature creators right he says you can change the atmosphere too many times you think that the preacher brings a Revival or or Youth Camp brings the Revival but you can bring the Revival if you're looking for the fire of God to flow through these pews once again you change the atmosphere you get here early and say God I'm looking I'm expecting I'm looking for you to move move like never before and that starts to change the atmosphere and it's conditioning you for your promise to be fulfilled oh Hallelujah you see we got to be persevering you see you remember brother the Brandon would talk about the the the the lady with the dead baby and she was standing out there in the rain and brother the brandom say she kept fighting and kept fighting and it was a commotion brother brandom says she he stopped and asked brother brother Jack Moore I believe and says she w know the difference you just go over there and pray for her and as he was going to go pray for her brother the brandom says a vision appeared over him and he seen a baby that was well and was standing and he would say hang on Brother Moore bring the baby to me and what I love about the story is brother Brandon would say there wasn't four 300 ushers that could keep her from getting to brother Brandon it was somebody that knew if I could just get to the prophet let me tell you this the prophet is off of the scene but the same Angel of the Lord is here every service if you're willing to be persevering for a breakthrough if you're willing to be perseverant to see God move like never before let nothing stop you oh my you may say well he seen a vision he he he had a word for her life you see that don't matter too many times we're looking for something Supernatural for us to believe in God again but the same word that was Discerning back then is the same word that can bring forth a a faith and a courage over your life tonight you see we don't need to stand before a Propet we've got the word you know and just to give a quick testimony you know my my sister-in-law one of them was had a had a sickness in her body and she was sitting at home listening to a tape and on that tape there was a discernment that would go forth and brother Brandon would Des ear a life and would say you're healed of it and my sister-in-law was sitting there and she realized that the same condition I she has was just caught out and if that lady was healed of it so can I be healed of it and right there the power of God would bring forth the healing it wasn't a prophet that was Discerning her but the same word that was Discerning in that prayer line is still Discerning today and whatever you have need of you don't need a holy man to come and pray for you you need some perseverance to say God if you are here to tonight I'm willing to do what it takes oh if it's a Sunday morning or a Sunday night get let me get into the right atmosphere oh Hallelujah you see in in another one I I was preaching in in in North Carolina at brother Roberto a a Hispanic church and I was preaching on heaviness and I was reading a quote on how brother Brandon was in a prayer line and would say there there there is a two dark Spirits hanging over you and it's because that you wanted to have a baby and you've had two miscarriage I'm sure y'all y' have heard that heard that quote before and he says there there's there's two Spirits hanging over you and it's because you want a baby and you've had two miscarriages and then brother brandham stops and he says but now you over here you've got an issue and he and he's starting to discern her this person's life over here and this lady's still standing here and and my mind automatically started to think what if she would have lost her faith you know standing there the Lord speaking to her called out her condition but never said she was well but then the spirit of the Lord moved over here but then brother brandom says you're you're healed of that then stops and he says so are you you're healed of that condition and so I'm telling the I'm reading this quote and after the service there's a prayer line and this lady comes up and she says brother Josh i' I've been in heaviness for a long time I wasn't sure what it was but I when you read the quote I had a miscarriage in the past and that same thing happened to me I've been under a heaviness but the same God that delivered her can deliver me it's not a prophet a man it's the prophetic word that is still Discerning lives and if you've got a need the same Jehovah Gyra is walking in the midst of the church today saying if you have a desire be perseverant Hallelujah even when it's not easy be perseverant oh Hallelujah you see brother the brandom he he he would say this here and he would say and the trouble of it now is we don't have people humbling themselves to get some crumbs I didn't get in the line that that don't make any difference just come and see if he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm after some crumbs so he says it don't matter if you're in the line and and you stand before me just coming expecting to see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and for forever and you will get some crumbs go brother Brandon would talk about the Greek Lady and he would say she had never seen a miracle before she had just heard that he could do these things he said she' never seen anything before and and this really spoke to me as a parent because she wasn't coming for her own need she was coming for her child and she didn't care if the preacher called her a dog she knew that my my my my daughter is hanging in the balance and I the Lord give us some more parents like that that don't get Hur over this don't get Hur over that but says God I even if I've never seen this happen before I know you can do it for my child my child is hanging in the balance let me persevere to get into the right atmosphere so my children could have a Revival you see I'm already interceding for my two children they're only one and one and three and I'm already praying and saying God it's impossible for them to be normal unless by God's grace you know I'm praying saying God God let me create an atmosphere in my home when I'm at a hotel room or or in the van let me create an atmosphere that their potentials can bloom don't let me let me push them away in an atmosphere of bitterness or or of gossip and this and that that that atmosphere starts to choke out the potentials but God let me get him in an atmosphere that the potentials that are in the inside of them is blossoming because of his grace I know that's all of you're desires to say God let me get them in the right atmosphere but Brandon would say this it takes the spirit of God to bring life and the life must not come out of just an intellectual Revival it's got to come out of the Bible a word Revival and the word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results you did in Acts 2 you see when the word Falls today and it quickens you get the same results and he says and because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere and so how do we get an atmosphere is by the spirit of God that's why we come and we come early and we we we get quiet and you know I turn on the tape before I come to church it's getting me in a in a condition that the spirit of God can create an atmosphere that's why brother Brandon going say get here 30 minutes early and pray and and read your Bible it's the spirit of God conditioning you to step into that atmosphere that when the word comes forth you're in an atmosphere that says even though it's crumbs it is mine even though it's a a church AG reading it is mine even though it's a a simple sermon it is mine I'm in the right atmosphere for the potentials to come forth oh little church we got to so good having a pastor that will preach the message of the hour not adding his own ideas his own thoughts but he's bringing forth a seed that drops into your atmosphere that the word can come forth brother Brandon I say if you want an oak tree let me give you an acorn you see it's potential it's potentially an oak tree but it's got to be planted in the right soil you see this word every sermon is seeds that is being thrown out and it's potentials that can fall in your life but it's got to be in the right soil the right atmosphere and as we're in the right ATM atmosphere the seed starts to fall and it manifest itself and and brother Brandon he he he would say this the word is a thought expressed God's thinking expressed it his words through the prophet they wrote the Bible which which is in word form and Jesus called it a seed and any seed will bring forth of its kind in the right condition the right atmosphere and you remember in the rising of the Sun but the Brandon would say that the Earth was over a gloomy atmosphere and he says there were seeds laying there that was dormant and it needed the sunlight to bring those seeds to life and so the sun did not put the seeds there the sun came because the seeds was already there and as that sun came over that atmosphere it pushed back the Gloom in order for that seed to be brought to light and sometimes we get in Gloomy atmospheres sometimes we get discouraged sometimes we get we get hurt but as the Sun the word starts to come over your life let it push back that Gloom brother Brandon must say it is the rising of the sun he said I don't have the quote in front of me but he would say that the rising of the sun there's a dual dual Sunrise whenever the the physical sun came up he says so did the eso wi and he says and those ladies ran and says he is risen and he says that sunlight went to all of the Nations and the people I thought that's powerful cuz this message has went around the world seven times not just to Nations but it has went to people it did not just come to Oklahoma but it came to PA it came to some people that was in atmospheres of Doubt atmospheres of Gloom and discouragement but as the word came over your life it pushed back that Gloom pushed back all of those atmospheres so that the seed can be brought to life oh my that's why we need a need a living word Jesus would say my words are spirit and they are life not just the mechanics but by Dynamics but the life behind that word and brother Brandon in the Easter seal he would talk about John do he says John Doe he was in God's thinking he was the attributes of God and he says even though it was millions and millions of years ago the god thought of him he says once he gets into the right atmosphere he says even though he's lying even though he cheating even though he he's doing all of these things but he says let him get under the right atmosphere he says then Joe John do is bound to recognize who his father is oh my he's bound to recognize no matter how far in sin he was once he got into that right atmosphere then it starts to bring a realization and that brother Brandon would tell us he says it's atmosphere that does things and he says the reason your men oh reason you men always always taught bring your children here is because it's the atmosphere for them to get the Holy Ghost and that really spoke to me John do he says he could have been uh in God's mind millions and millions of years ago and he's lying and he's cheating but in the right atmosphere it brings a realization who his father is then he says you you you fathers bring your children to church because in this atmosphere is where the Holy Ghost Falls and he in that quote he would say some of you saw me wink at a young girl he says that was my daughter Rebecca and he says I'm glad she's here with me because she's needing the Holy Ghost and he says in this atmosphere she can get the Holy Ghost and I thought my we're not bringing our children to church in vain cuz we know in this atmosphere there's a deep calling to a deep you see even when they're sick even when they're tired if they can come bring them to church and let them get in into an atmosphere and even at a young age and and brother Brandon would say he says that no matter if you're Presbyterian if you're Baptist if you're Methodist in the right atmosphere it'll hatch out a newborn child of God claim the word it's the atmosphere that does it no matter the denomination tag you have on it so it don't matter the denominational tag they might not know know anything about the move of God but if there is somebody that does know something about it and create an atmosphere then somebody that don't have a clue can step into that and I thought M that's what we do as parents our children don't know anything we're raising them up but we do have understanding we do got Revelation even when they don't our Revelation is creating a Haven creating an atmosphere that you're the the TR we're training up a child in the way it should go and once it gets in that right atmosphere at the predestinated time the right season something's going to recognize that wow God's my father oh Hallelujah it don't matter where they are at as long as there's somebody with understanding that's say son come in my atmosphere I'm I'm Sheltering you from all of the things of the world get into this atmosphere with me oh Hallelujah cuz many times we want our children saved but not willing to create the right atmosphere and you know and maybe your children you know don't don't have a clue about things but let me create the right atmosphere because we've got something to do you know the woman that that that that when Jesus says you're a dog you know she couldn't stop and just go back home and say honey hope you get well let's go try another doctor but no it was up to her they to to persevere and say Jesus you're my last hope you know if I if I don't get an answer from you what's my what's my child going to do you know I think of job yeah the Bible would tell us that that that his friends would come and say he's a secret Sinner and if you if you look at him if he would have started to doubt that he if he started to think he was a secret sinner he was losing his faith on the bloody sacrifice right it was the bloody sacrifice that made him just and so even though the accusations said he was a secret sinner he knew because of that sacrifice I'm a just person but what if he started to doubt his own sacrifice what hope would he have had for his children that was already gone right cuz the Bible told us that he did a sacrifice for his children just in case they would sin so if he lost faith in his own sacrifice what about the Next Generation oh little church that's why as parents have got to make sure we got the right atmosphere cuz if we lose our faith what about the Next Generation now like how brother brother Andrew said on Sunday what about the Next Generation that's why we got to unclog the channels if the water ain't flowing what hope does the Next Generation God but I say we've got shovels tonight on a Sunday morning Sunday night to unclog the channels the water can flow not just for me but for my loved ones so that my children ain't going out into the world my children ain't Ain dabling in things of the world but because of me there's water going to the Next Generation Hallelujah let me create that atmosphere for the Next Generation you see brother Brandon would say this when you talk to that child and he he's talking about whenever you you wanting people who are saved and the message the and the token and he calls out mothers and I think I think that's so profound and he says you mothers and he says when you talk to that child when you talk to that husband or talk to your wife talk to that loved one believe that it's going to help just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they are mine I'm getting them for you apply it and create the atmosphere around you that that will drop right into it oh there you are if you've got the token you create a spirit around you he says apply the token with it and walk then walk with it and claim your household he says when you talk to your loved ones he says you're applying that token and then you're letting that atmosphere bring your claim into manifestation he says you claim it then create that atmosphere oh my and I thought my it's mothers you know brother Brandon W call you all that the Fifth Gospel right I believe it's because you're the ones that are showing the Life of Christ Matthew Mark Luke John is is showing the Life of Christ and its mothers that brother Brandon would commissioned that you claim your children you claim the children apply the token and then create that atmosphere for your children children that's what we do at home when we turn on tapes it's creating an atmosphere when we bring them to church it's creating an atmosphere oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon he would tell us we're a little Creator right and he said you you create the Atmosphere by the way you live by the way you talk your conversations he says uh he says and you you've seen them all the you you've seen those that every time you shun them all the time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody say oh my there they came they're going to criticize somebody there here here he is now he's going to talk about this man they're going to tell dirty jokes and or something about a woman or something like that you just hate to get around them see cuz they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and the things you think on the things you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere man that that that should just that struck me between the eyes you know the what the things I talk about what the thing the way I live the the things I criticize you know I criticize people that's creating an atmosphere you know and the Bible would talk about the two they're walking on the way to the road to Emmas they were talking about how Jesus was dead they thought he was the Messiah and the Bible says Jesus himself Drew near and came to them and the Bible says their eyes was Holden that they should not know him and then Jesus looks at them and says what manner of communications are these that you have one to another that you are sad and so what they were talking about was creating an atmosphere of Gloom well I love the story because the the Bible tells us that Jesus did not leave him there he was willing to walk with him willing to take him back to scripture but they had to receive him and once they received the word and he broke the bread then their eyes was open it was the broken bread that would bring him out of that gloomy atmosphere and we've had a message in this generation you know broken bread that would could bring us out of an Earthly atmosphere and place us into Heavenly places that can change our communication that can change the way we the way we act the way we talk it can change us that we can walk in a right atmosphere because we're living in a time of gross darkness and I know these things are simple tonight but the Bible would tell us in Isaiah 60 And1 arise and shine for thy light has come the glory of the Lord is risen upon on thee for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee so the Bible is talking about two different classes the Lord is going to come upon one and gross darkness is coming upon the other and brother the brand or the Bible would tell us that there's been what 200,000 demons that has been lifted out of the river Euphrates and the Bible tells us that it's gross Darkness over the people brother Brandon would say man wants to look like woman woman wants to look like man it goes to show there is a perversion a dark Spirit hanging over gross Darkness over the people so the gross darkness that the Bible's talking about there spirits that are coming over and Spirits create atmospheres and brother the Brandon would tell us that there's a shadow of Darkness just over the people that is pressing them so it's the the gross Darkness are spirits that are trying to to press in your mind trying to press in your homes try trying to press in your spirit man and we see it's not demons that we can see but it's Spirits in another dimension so in order to fight these Spirits we got to be equipped to fight in another dimension you see and I talked about some of these things last time I had preached but we got to be in the Heavenly places in order to fight in that other dimension cuz there's no way you can pick up a natural sword and and fight the enemy right you can't pick up a a bazooka and fight the enemy but it's something what you get into Heavenly places you're picking up the word in the right atmosphere and you're sending the word you're sining thus sayith the Lord and that is starting to whoop the devil any place under any condition and so as it's Shadows Of Darkness that's pressing the people and we see that that's creating a heaviness where there's no rest there's there's fear there there's turmoil and you can't even ask at somebody going to down the road how they're doing and it happened the other day you ask somebody how they're doing and their confession is always this went wrong that went wrong they're speaking from the atmosphere that they are dwelling in and that's the reason that the devil sends us through hard times right you know brother Brandon would talk about how when he came home a a and his wife was crying the children were fighting and he says the baby was screaming he says the children hadn't eaten all day and he says his wife comes up to him and says Billy I'm about to lose my mind and in that state it was a chaotic atmosphere but there was a man of God that wasn't willing to leave his family in that condition brother brandom says I didn't fight with her he says I rolled up my sleeves and says honey what do you want for supper I see you have eaten and brother brandom says she looked at him and says bill you can't cook supper he says you can do the dishes but you can't cook supper he says oh honey you've never tried my potatoes before and he says right there that atmosphere and he says J didn't know what I was doing he says but in my heart I was saying God help my wife he was saying Lord she has stood for you her her hair is almost gray because of the ministry that that she's been with me Lord help my wife and all along he was just talking Comfort words to her and that was changing the atmosphere it was the husband that came home from work maybe but wasn't willing to let that wife stay in that atmosphere where she felt like she was going to lose her mind and man you know uh wives go through it you know Mama go through it but you don't got to stay in that atmosphere you know you don't got to stay in that place where you don't feel like you you can keep going on you don't feel like you're good enough for your your family or good enough for your children you're a Creator where you can change that atmosphere and I'm so thankful that that brother Brandon was showing us that he was Human Too Human just like all of us you know and so get that a human being can change that atmosphere and you see brother the Brandon he preaches a message called letting off the pressure five times and he says if you don't let off the pressure you're going to explode and he says the the husband is racing home flying by and he says he gets home and he's he's home too early and he says uh the the wife don't have the don't have the supper ready because he's home too early and he says what happened they explode and he says what was it it was pressure and all of that is going back to an atmosphere but I don't believe we're to be dictated by the darkness that is pressing against us you see we're not called to be dictated there's two classes of people one the gross darkness is upon and another that the glory of the Lord is coming upon and I don't believe we're to be dictated by gross Darkness but the glory of the Lord has risen upon us and and brother Brandon would talk about about Joshua and he says when he said this when he said Son stand still he says he was tied to an absolute and he was under a commission and since he was tied to an absolute he would say son stand still so even though his atmosphere was starting to change and darkness was coming over his situation since he was tied to something solid he would speak the word and 11 brother Brandon would dramatize it he says he didn't stop and pray about it he didn't get the the men together and say let us pray for more sunlight he says no he had need of it and he spoke the word and that's the way it is with us we're tied to an absolute we're tied to the word of God in Heavenly places and when darkness tries to come over our situations we don't got to stop and say oh Lord I thought you promised me Victory we're tied to an absolute we say son stand still Darkness get back Moon you hold over there I'm sitting I'm tied to an absolute Hallelujah I'm tied to something and said I'm tied to this I've got a creative power you see there's a separation that has taken place and you remember there in Egypt that while the plagues were Fallen the children of Israel was in in Egypt but isolated in Goan and I thought this was so powerful in Exodus 8:22 the Bible would say and I will sever in that day the land of Goan in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou May knowest that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth and I will put division between my people and thy people tomorrow shall this shall this sign be and the word sever means to be separated to make separate set apart so even though the children of Israel was in Egypt they were separated into the land of Goan and here we are in Leo but we've been separated into a bright age we've been separated into Heavenly places and brother Brandon would tell us how do we get into Heavenly places it's the word coming the word Has Lifted us up into Heavenly places so even though we're living G Le Ora there was a voice saying come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins and brother Brandon would say this and just stop just one moment here in Heavenly places not just anywhere but in Heavenly places he would say we are heavenlies in our souls he says oh what could happen tonight what could happen if we get to be setting in Heavenly places in a Heavenly atmosphere the Holy Spirit moving everywhere every heart that's been regenerated and become a new cre new creature in Christ Jesus he says God let me never leave here just Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and brother brandom he would say that Heavenly places is an atmosphere and I'd never seen that before till recently I guess he says Heavenly places is an atmosphere he says that's your position in Christ Jesus and what I what I love about it is brother brandom could look into that other atmosphere you know he he as a prophet he could look into that other atmosphere and I was listening to a tape and brother brandom was in a prayer line and there was a lady that would start to cry and brother brandom says you you something just changed he says you feel something is here the closer you get to me he says that is the Angel of the Lord and he says it's standing here in this heavenly atmosphere and so even though the lady could not see it there was a prophet that could identify what was there another place he would say that the angel of the Lord is in a Heavenly atmosphere and in another place he would say that there are angels mingling near in this heavenly atmosphere we could not see it but there was a prophet that could look into that other atmosphere and tell us what is there but what's so powerful is brother Brandon would not just leave it for us he would say we would say this when your faith catches the word it sends you into another dimension so now we're not just relying on brother the brand I'm saying there are angels mingling here but there's a word that has sent us into Heavenly places in another dimension where we believe that they are here we know that every time we come to church angels are mingling near brother Brandon going talk about uh Elijah and Gesa he would say whenever Gesa came and said we're surrounded but the brandom says that Elijah did not see the Angels there he believed that they were there so him believing sent him into another dimension that he knew they were there and US believing the word of God sends us into another dimension that we believe all things are possible even when nothing is changing we're in Heavenly places when the circumstances ain't changing when when there trials are work and the and the home life is chaotic we're still setting in the right atmosphere because of the word for the brand say this The Headstone crying what Grace Grace pass from death and create into a Living Word of the Living God God's only provided plan for his a for this age for his sons in a word age quickened by his Spirit like a spark that's that that Lit off something to make it alive and seeed that now in Heavenly places past tense he says already alive subject to every promise of the word of God little musicians come tonight and here here's the quote I referred to earlier brother Brandon would say in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus for we claim that we passed from Death un Life by his promise we are caught up in a Heavenly atmosphere and sitting with him now my so we've been called up how by a word coming to call us up High into a Heavenly atmosphere where there's Angels mingling near where the angel of the Lord is accompanying this word always even when we don't see him even when we don't see the angels we know that he is here brother Brandon would say this such a sweet feeling now no oh if you could just feel this wonderful Heavenly atmosphere it's is it's his presence now you're see the angel on that picture almighty God who would judge me at that at the day of judgment no that that angel is right here right now you're looking this way looking straight towards it not me him I can feel a moving in the audience everywhere it was a Heavenly atmosphere in that Heavenly atmosphere was the angel of the Lord and little church that's why we got to create an atmosphere you know that's why we don't just come to church at out of a ritual or a duty become the church to get into an atmosphere that changes can take place the that our children can be filled with the Holy Ghost not just a tradition but an atmosphere and you know brother Brandon when talking about the churches A Million Miles Away he says they've lost their sincerity and they're in a ritual a tradition you know they're doing what they think that that God is leading them to do but there's no Spirit behind it you know it's a ritual and Lord don't let us make comeing to church a ritual I know I know that's all heall Des are Lord let me come to church to be persevering let me come to church so that the potentials can come forth the brotherly kindness can come forth you know that joy and peace and love can come forth the Revival I want to see Revival like never before in this church you know I can't just say I want a Revival and not do nothing to get a Revival right if I want a Revival I've got to do something about it you know brother Austin if you want to Revival you've got to do something about it you know you got to do something brother Caleb if you want a Revival we can't just say Lord send a Revival to fix the problems Lord let me be the Revival start with me then let me spread the Wildfire to this one send the fire to that one send the fire to this situation to that circumstance amen let's bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord thank you for your your presence we feel here tonight Lord Lord may we take this presence home with us Lord this heavenly atmosphere Lord is where your angels are and Lord even when we don't see him Lord may we be like Elijah and say because the word said so I know they're there Lord we're we're limited to our five senses Lord but your Prophet would tell us that Faith rescues us Lord and Lord if there's some here that's discouraged in a in in a wrong Gap atmosphere Lord a spirit of heaviness Lord May there be a pulsation of Faith RIS in their soul lord and rescue them from their five senses from their imagination their reasoning their affection their conscience their memory Whatever It Is God lord May there be a liberty like never before a Revival strike Lord Lord let us not just say we want a Revival but Lord may we get into action to bring a Revival and say Lord whatever it takes if I got to dig some ditches I'm going to dig some ditches if I need a apologize I'm going to apologize if I need to repent of some hidden sins I'm going to repent Lord whatever it is Lord God may we unclog the channels but water can flow like never before father Lord I
