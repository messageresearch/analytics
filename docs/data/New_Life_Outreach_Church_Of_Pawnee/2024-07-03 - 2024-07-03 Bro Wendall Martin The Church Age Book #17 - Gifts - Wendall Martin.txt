our name or position but we're Victorious because the lamb is Victorious and so we are thankful for that you know we're still here in um in in Revelations 2 and 12 and so we're going to we're just going to um uh look uh just that 12th verse and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges and we know that that is the Lord Jesus Christ it's his spirit that is Among Us here today today let's go to the Lord in prayer now I just noticed that sister uh April has asked for prayer for her um her Granddad and so let's let's pray for

the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this evening amen so we're we're um we're still in the church age book and uh amen we're going to read tonight we're going to fast forward a little bit we're going to read in the uh page 299 and we're going to stay in the same um along the same vein that we were the other night and um and uh the last Wednesday night we want to deal a little bit more with the gifts in the church and um and uh so I want we're going to read here 299 and I want to um see to it that we see um where brother brandham and the and where the scripture is is showing us the the Supernatural and why the devil wants to counterfeit it there's a reason he wants to counterfeit this and um um he he wouldn't want to counterfeit it if it if it if if it wasn't so important but it is important it's very important in the church and so um now the this is we're going to be reading out of the Philadelphian Church age and brother brother brandham is is just going to be telling us now it took the third um uh matters of fact we'll just let's just read there in in 299 I wasn't going to read that second paragraph but let's go and read it he says I want you to see something here God Works in threes doesn't he he was in the third or pergam pergam Manan age that the church was married to the state the Deeds of the nicians had become the doctrines of the nicians that age was the open door for the false Vine once it was backed up by the power of the state it become actually a world system even though it bore the name Christian thus it spread like wildfire but now Three Ages later after a long and hard struggle of Faith here comes the open door to the truth the word of the Lord now has its day of course the fifth age had set the stage of this Mighty move as the age gave us exploration colonization printing of books Etc now that's the the um the ages that fifth age that was Lutheran age now this here is the wesling age he says it would have been wonderful if this Open Door had followed the Divine pattern of Pentecost which was set forth in Hebrews 2 1-4 therefore we ought to give more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the words spoken by Angels were steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders diverse Miracles gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will now you know now you know that this is the pattern for Jesus himself said so Mark 16 15- 20 and he said unto them go ye into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues and they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on this sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken these unto them he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere and the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following amen he never told them to go into all the world and establish Bible colleges nor did he tell them to pass out literature now those things are fine but what Jes Jesus told them to do was to preach the gospel stick with the word and then the signs would follow ver the very first introduction we have in the in the way of the kingdom of God was preached when he was sent when he sent out the 12 Matthew 10 1-8 he commissioned and instructed them on this wise when he had called unto him his 12 disciples and gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sick and all manner of disease now the names of the twel Apostles are these first Simon who was called Peter and Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee John his brother Phillip and bar baralu and Thomas and matthus the uh Publican James the son of alfus and laus whose surname is thus uh Simon the Canaanite night Judas iscar who also betrayed him these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the uh to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and as ye preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the leper raise the Dead cast out Devils freely heal have received freely give now this ministry that he gave them was actually the sharing of his own Ministry with them for it says in Matthew 9 and 35-38 Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom healing EV every sickness and every disease among the people and when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd then he said unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth labors into his Harvest now many people have the idea that just the apostles has this ministry given them by the Lord Jesus and so when they died the ministry was over that is not so here in Luke 10 1-9 we find that in the last days of his Earthly Journey he had already started to give ministers uh give ministries of power to his own after these things the Lord appointed other 70 also and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place whether he himself would come therefore said he unto them the Harvest is truly truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth labors into his uh labors into his Harvest go your ways behold I send you forth as Lambs among the wolves carry neither purses nor script nor shoes and salute no one no man by the way into whatsoever house you enter first say peace be to this house and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not ye shall turn you again and in the same house remaining um uh and in the same house remaining eating and drinking such thing as they give for the laborers worthy of his hire go not from house to house and into whatsoever City ye enter and they receive you eat such things that are set before you heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of God is nigh unto you who would dare deny the the mighty Ministry of Phillip who would dare to deny the minist mighty ministries of irus Martin Columba Patrick countless scores of others who had God's anointing upon them yes the Bible Way is the real way of the open door I want to add my testimony to that the reason I have to do that is because I can only speak with Assurance concerning what God has done in my own life and if you'll excuse a personal note here I will tell you how I know for assurity that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and that that the power of God is still available to those who will believe and receive aren't you glad for that the power of God is still for those who will believe it and receive it during my missionary trip to South Africa God so blessed that I came to Durban the only place that could begin to accommodate the people was the huge racetrack which is the second largest in the world and the crowd was well over a 100,000 in order to keep Law and Order they had to put up fences to separate the various tribes they posted hundreds of policemen to keep the throngs quieted down those hungry Souls had come for many miles a queen from rhasia had come with a train of of 27 coaches loaded with uh African natives they struggled in across the fields and mountains and bearing on their backs for many and many a mile some loved one that needed help the whole country was stirred by the mighty works that had been manifested by the Holy Spirit one afternoon as I began to minister one of thousands of the muhammadans came up on the platform and as she stood before me a missionary to the muhammadans begin to softly implore the Lord oh for this pre that precious Soul oh for that precious Soul he had been over there for years and years according to his own testimony he had only he had seen only one Muhammad had come to receive Jesus Christ as Savior they were originally the mle Persians whose law changed not they are hard to win it seems once a Muhammad and always a muhammadan is is a law amongst them well as she stood before me I begin to speak to her and to all those thousands through the interpreters I said is it not so that the missionaries have told you of a Jesus who would come to save you you should have seen the people look at each other when I said that and when they had answered uh that I was correct I went on and said but did the missionaries read you out of this book I uh the I held up my Bible a loft for them to see that the same Jesus was a mighty healer and that he that he would live in his people down Through the Ages until he come again to receive them unto himself they uh did did they tell you that because of that same spirit in them that was in Jesus that they would be able to do the mighty works as Jesus did did they tell you that you can be healed even as you can be saved how many of you would like to see the same Jesus come down amongst us and do the same things he did when he was here on Earth long ago they all wanted that that is one thing they surely agreed on I then went on if Jesus by his spirit will do what he did upon the Earth uh what he did upon the Earth will you believe his word then and here was that Muhammad woman in front of me the spirit began to move through me I said to her now I know that you know that I don't know know you I can't even speak your language she admitted that I said as for healing you you know I can not but you heard the message this afternoon and understood me her Indian interpreter answered back uh for her that she understood for she had read the New Testament now the muhammadans are are descendants of Abraham they believe in one God but they reject Jesus as the Son of God and instead they take muhamad as his prophet and they say that Jesus never died and rose again they are taught that by their priest and they believe it I said but Jesus did die and rise again he sent his Spirit back upon the church and the spirit that was in him is the same spirit in the church now and it can and will produce what Jesus produced he said in John 5:19 the son can do nothing of him self but what he sees the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise now then if Jesus will come and reveal to me what your trouble is or what you are here for if he can tell me what your past is surely you can believe for the future and she said through her interpreter yes I can I said all right may he do it those muhammadans are watching intently and they're all leaning forward to see what would happen then the Holy Spirit spoke your husband is a short heavy set man with a black mustache you have two children you were at the doctors about 3 days ago and he gave you an examination you have a cyst on the womb she bowed her head and said that is true I asked her how is it that you came to me a Christian why didn't you go to your Muhammad and priest she said I think you can help me I said I can't help you but if you receive Jesus Christ as your savior he who is here now and knows all about you he'll help you and she says Jesus is she she said I accept Jesus as my savior and that did it she was healed and about 10,000 mohammadans came to Christ that day because the gospel was preached in both word and power God never told a man to labor 30 years and harvest nothing he gave us the open door of the word and power and that is what we are supposed to use can I hear anything amen that is what gave Paul his great effective Ministry 1 Corinthians 2 and 4 my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power listen to me now it was it was while I was on the same trip that I was boarding a plane in New Salisbury uh rhasia that I saw a party of four with American passports and I went over to them and said hello there I see you have American passports are you traveling somewhere and the young man answered me no we are all missionaries here how nice I replied are you on your own or do you work with some organization we are Methodist we come from Wilmore Kentucky he said well that's almost in my backyard I replied you wouldn't be that brother brandham that comes up uh comes up that way would you I said yes that's right that cured him he wouldn't say any any another thing and the way he and those girls just look back and forth at each other so I said just a minute son I'd like to speak to you all about some principles seeing you all are Christians and here for a great purpose now you say you all have been here uh you four have been here for two years can you say in the name of Jesus that you can put a finger on one so that you know you have one to the Lord they could not I don't want to hurt your feelings girls I said but you ought to be home helping your mothers with dishes you hav't any business on the field unless you are filled with the Holy Ghost preaching the true gospel in the demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost if you're not seeing the results that Jesus said you would see it's because you're not preaching the true gospel can you say Amen now so you can see amen you can see where the importance of this of this amen the the the power of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is the power of God it's what anoints the word and as Believers we're not we are not called to just come and set in church and have song service and preach to each other we are to live powerful lives anointed lives lives that can set the captives free that's what the original church had and that's what God's commissioned us to do Amen brother brother brandom if you'd go back to page uh page 90 we've already read this in the past but um what what would what did the church first church fall from and would just going to read two paragraphs here page 90 and um and we're going to start there at the second paragraph and when you're there just say Amen all right it says God tells them to remember evidently something had left their minds that this is to the Ephesian Church they had forgotten something he told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin the origin of the first age was Pentecost they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and wonder of it it was time to go back in mind and then in reality back to when they could say for me to live as Christ back to Purity when ananas and safias safaris was dealt with back to the gate beautiful oh what a reproach it is to drift from God and countenance those acts that that that defile his name let those who name his name depart from sin and keep your vessels pure for God look at what you once were in your mind and heart in your life then go back to it and what is the way back the way is the way of repentance if a sinner has to come to God by the way of repentance then the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent uh that much more repent bring bring forth fruit uh uh yeah bring forth fruit meet for repentance prove it by your life if you do not repent said God I will remove your Candlestick certainly a church in that condition can't give light to the world its light has turned to Darkness God will take it take away its faithful messenger and its faithful Shepherds and leave them to themselves and they will go on talking about Christianity but be bereft of it can you say Amen so so we can see the importance the the importance of the of of that of of of of the Holy Spirit Pentecost and what and and what the church that first church was amen now um uh brother uh brother brandham if You' just put that first chart up sister khila brother brandham this is what he said in 19 65 he says he says Jesus said I am the light and you are in him how do you get into him joining him no shaking no baptism of water no by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body which is the body of Christ and in that body is nine spiritual gifts operating through through the local body the local church that's Apostolic if I ever knew it that's right so so when when you when you hear and you see on the internet and you and you hear other preachers that are saying that that is no longer all we need is the word that's the only thing the word will produce the Living Word produces a living Christ logos living logos brother brandom says it was the logos that brooded over the ground in the beginning that brought up the botle life that brought up the animal life it was it was the pillar of fire brooding over the seed and when we have the true word of God the holy spirit is to come and brood over that word and make that word to live in us that's what makes Christianity it's not another religion it is the life of God can you say Amen did you know that brother bradam said there are gifts in the church right now we're already in that local assembly go ahead and go to that second that second chart there uh sister keys he says but you can't speak in tongues Les you have um uh see oh I gave you the yeah that's that's the right one uh and and no doubt at all but what there's many of the many gifts of that in this church right now there's many of gifts of it here in the Methodist Church uh in the Baptist Church but if it was only preached so the gift could go away from it one let's go to that third chart just real quickly then we're going to read a little bit in the book of Acts praise the Lord how many's enjoying yourself tonight amen now now this is going to be a little bit harder to read I I um I I should have broke that down a little bit more amen he says now you take a tree and put it away from water and the first thing you know you got little old apples and that are all naughty and worm eaten and and cast uh but it casts its crop and that's what's the matter with the churches today you've done got away from that River you've got away from them gifts of the Spirit they got just a church now natural and they get away from the spiritual gifts and the spiritual things and they cast their fruits what do they do they're Believers live with the world act like the world steal cheat lie Smoke Drink gamble Bunko games in the church to pay the preacher and everything else super suppers dances they cast their fruits it's just like the world and the unbeliever look and say there's no difference in that in between them and me can you say Amen so now I I I I want us to just look here there is a church that God puts his stamp of approval upon and the power of the Holy Ghost is not a dirty word amen and matters of fact I would say if there is anything that we should be hungering for more today more than games and more than television and and we should be hungering more than than uh uh boyfriends girlfriends whatever else it should be that the power of the Holy Spirit would flow through US amen now now there in the we're going to read a little bit I'm going to share amen of of some of the gifts of the Spirit that that had operated in the in that first church because brother bradam says we've got to go back to Pentecost and so uh we're going to look at a at a a few read a few of the stories there uh tonight now now the church was filled with the Holy Ghost in Acts 2 and then the Bible says that they were refilled with the Holy Ghost in Acts four you know what that tells me amen if you've got the Holy Ghost here tonight uh you can still have a refilling I believe there's refilling upon refilling of the Holy Ghost and what God done for you in the yester years amen what God done for you and the Miracles you've seen and the and and the power of God that how God used you in your life a he's still the same God all you've got to do as we read that as we read that one amen is we got to repent go back and say God I need a refilling of your Holy Spirit I need a renewing it doesn't mean that you lose the Holy Ghost amen it's just a amen it's just a a stirring of the water stirring of your amen expectation let the holy ghost live it's it's the same thing you have to do with your marriage you can't you can't you you can't go without telling your wife you love her you can't go without taking her out to eat and and if she's cranky and and and and that sort of thing well you can complain about it amen or if he's cranky but but but why don't you do something about it and most of the time there's just got to be an oldfashioned falling in love again and saying you know amen we I I I I I don't care about my side your side I just want the origins I want the origin of love I want it to come back to its Beginnings can you say amen and that's the way we want now another thing I want you to notice now if there there are six places I believe there is in the book of Acts that says the gift of the Holy Ghost amen so there is one gift amen what is the Holy Ghost well it's the person of God himself amen it's eternal life it's the living Pres presence of God in you the gifts of the Holy Ghost amen these are the manifestations of the Holy Ghost these are gifts that are given amen now you can have you can have you can have gifts and not have the Holy Ghost but you cannot have the Holy Ghost and not have the gifts in your life you say I don't know of any gifts in my life amen they're there they're there if you've got the Holy Ghost the gifts are there now you don't manufacture them you can't manufacture them what's the requirement God you've saved me for a purpose you've given me the Holy Ghost for a purpose and I want these gifts to live and manifest if you notice the Apostle Paul says the manifestations of the nine spiritual gifts can you say amen I can't teach you to prophesy I can't teach you to speak in tongues amen whatever gift is laying in you and God gives that the Bible says he gives it severally to whomsoever he will can you say amen and so amen when we look amen the the reason for them what why they're in Sister keys if you wouldn't mind put up there acts 1 and8 just real quickly and I and you don't have to turn there because you've already read this many of times but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost comes upon you for what reason to be Witnesses unto him so the purpose for the purpose for the Holy Ghost and the power of the Holy Ghost is to be a witness of that Heavenly Kingdom amen sister Keys uh there acts 5 and 32 amen acts 5:32 and it says and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him so if you obey him you repent amen and and and the Holy Ghost comes upon you then the Holy Ghost In You becomes a witness of the supernatural you're not manufacturing it you're not making it up you we're not having to Voodoo with the music we're not having to I me do no no no no no the gifts are there to them who will surrender themselves to that gift now as we discussed the other night last Wednesday night is um many many times we we think that there's only that there's only two gifts okay amen prophecy and and uh uh prophecy and speaking in tongues amen well there's a lotch of them there's the gift of faith there's the gift of Miracles there's the gifts of healing there's the gift of Prophecy there's the gift of tongues and interpretation of tongues and I have and the gift of wisdom and I've got two more amen um the gift so so gift of knowledge gift of knowledge amen and and so uh so these are gifts and you can see them on display here in the in the book of Acts now I also want to say this amen uh um as we get as we get ready if you want to turn if you want to turn to um let's just turn to Acts 3 and 6 amen but we we we find that there's three different ways that the Holy Ghost fell in the book of Acts amen acts two is the clothing tongues of fire was seen they came down upon them amen and then acts two or or the second form was over there in in in in Acts 10 and44 in the house of Cornelius while Peter preached the word the Holy Ghost fell upon them is that right and then you find over there in Acts uh the 8th chapter and the 14th verse that the holy ghost that they had repented they had been baptized but as of yet the Holy Ghost had came over on on hadn't came on any of them and and the apostles laid their hands upon them and they began and they all received the Holy Ghost so so God's not just got one little in in a little box amen God can fill you with the Holy Ghost I remember one night I was I was um I was just preaching I was just a kid and and I was just preaching away and there was this boy that wanted the Holy Ghost so bad and and um I knew enough about the message to know that not not to look for tongues amen that's that's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost and I I just told him you're going to know and and he would he would come and I just I need the Holy Ghost I said listen amen do I have it and I said well the the if if you're questioning then you probably don't so so just keep on just keep on praying it's going to come I don't know how I don't know when it's going to come and and I was up there just preaching away and then all of a sudden scared me to death he scared everybody to death he jumped up in the middle of the service he jumped up and he says I got it when I got it I've got the Holy Ghost and I'm here to tell you God forever more changed and it was Nathan it was my dad's little brother he was he was uh he was a year younger than me so amen uh he matter of fact he had a car wreck when he was 18 years old and um and he U he had just received the Holy Ghost two weeks uh three four weeks before uh before he had that Rank and I I'll never forget it amen it changed his total life amen he he he he just had it rough in life and tried alcohol and drugs and was this and that and just oh but when he wanted to when he when he got right with God he had to get baptized and had to get repented but I remember when he received the Holy Ghost now I tell you what that that that guy was he was so excited amen it he just messed the whole service up we couldn't we couldn't get him to shut up for nothing and Nathan was quiet he so it was quite a it was quite a a deal but when the power of God comes upon you amen it listen I I I believe in the power of God I welcome the power of God I want the power of God so let's look at Pentecost let's let's look for a little bit and just let's brother brandom says the glory and wonder of it amen so so let's look here in in the book of Acts and we'll read here at the uh third chapter we're just going to uh we're going to move along quickly amen it says uh let's see here three and six amen it says and and and these guys have come to well let's let's see here um let's let's just read the whole story first verse and Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked him asked and arms and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look upon us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said silver and gold I have none but such as I have I give thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping stood up and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking and praising God and they knew that it was he which set for arms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which happened unto him can you say amen amen now let's let's let's let's go over I want to I want us to look at the gifts of of uh discernment over here in in Acts 5 and one amen and um this is this is going to be a story of when when uh they were selling their homes and and and U uh and and bringing it in and and and they um each each person after they sold their homes they were to they they they were going to give as much there was I there was no requirement as what they had to give to the church but but um they um um but they would come in and they they were they were getting rid of everything they had because of the persecution and so I here ananas and surfaris had sold their home and so here let's let's just start here at the first verse fifth chapter but a certain man named ananas with Safara his wife sold a possession and kept part uh back part of the price and his wife also being privy to it uh and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet but Peter said ananas why hast thou filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost now this is discernment this is God Amen this is the gift of knowledge this is God showing the word of knowledge Amen to keep back part of the price of thy land whilst it remained uh was it not thine own after it was sold was it not thine in thine own power why hast thou concealed this thing in thine heart and th thou Hast not lied unto men but unto God and anas hearing these thing these words fell down and gave up The Ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things could you imagine being in a church where people are dying because they're lying amen and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him and it was about the space of 3 hours after that when his wife not knowing what was done came in and Peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sowed the land for so much and she said yay for so much then Peter said unto her how is it that you have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out and then she fell down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead carrying carrying her forth buried her with her husband and great fear come upon all the church and upon as many as heard them can you say Amen now now brother brandham says what you you'll you'll see this over and over throughout the message he says Satan don't want the gifts in the church because the the gifts keep the church clean so so the gifts are for our edification but gifts are not there just to make things but gifts are there Amen to to to bring out sin gifts are there to Amen to cause fear upon the church to say listen amen not to follow a man not to follow a pastor not to follow uh uh even even uh brother brandham but to follow that word because we're not it's not we we we're not we we want you you know people people term us as bramit as if we're following a personality we're not following a personality we're following the word and so when we hear the word now there's many that are following the personality amen they're following the personality there's a lot of people that are deceived and are simply following a personality and how do I know this is because they're not giving themselves to the word that the prophet brought they're happy and content to say amen I I I'm a message believer I believe brother brandom is a prophet that is wonderful that you you can do that all you want to but if it's not LED you back to a burning deep down desire to please the Lord that I'm sorry you're following a personality the this holy spirit is living and that word must live in us can you say amen amen hallelujah you love him now so so going back now amen I these were these were gifts of the Spirit that were in the first church let's go to the let's just go real quickly to the sixth church or the sixth chapter amen and and and talking about stepen there and he he wasn't even really a preacher or anything but he uh uh he he was a he was a act he was a deacon amen and Steven full of faith and power and did great wonders and miracles among the people and there also there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of Libertines and S sirenians and alexandrians of them of cissa and of Asia disputing with Steven and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke these are gifts that are in his life this was a man that didn't it wasn't that he was learned it was that he had the Holy Ghost and the scripture says I just open your mouth and I will give you the words and brother did he preach a sermon he goes all the way to on down there through the seventh chapter amen and and um if you would go to the seventh chapter and on all the way down to the 54th verse after he gets through preaching their their their uh the sermon amen well look what happens and when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they nashed on them with on him with their teeth but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and he said behold I see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at on the right hand of God and when they cried with loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul which later became Paul and they stoned Sten and and calling uh uh calling upon the God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit he knelled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep now isn't that isn't that just a crazy it how many believes that anointing is still with us today that anointing is here amen that's that's the wonderment of the church let's let's look over here at the eth chapter over here at the uh eth chapter and the fifth verse this is another he's not amen uh this one here was another Deacon and it says then Phillip went down to the city of Samar uh Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did that's one of the gifts of the Spirit and for un unclean spirits crying with a loud voice coming uh come out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with pauses and that were lame and were healed and there was great joy in that City well praise the name of the Lord amen now now now I I like I I love this story here because now he's there preaching now you talk about you you talking about being able to ride without a car uh without a shuttle or anything now what this is this was incredible ible if if if you were to go on on down amen while he's there in that City there's an account given matters of fact I think it's in the 26th verse amen um yeah let's just let's uh let's go to the 25th verse and and they when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord return to Jerusalem and and preach the gospel in many of The Villages of the Samaritans and the angel of the Lord spake unto Phillip saying arise and go forward go toward the South under the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is the desert and he arose now now here's an angel an angel just appearing to a common man he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia a unic of great Authority Under Candice Queen of the Ethiopians who had the charge of all of her treasure treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his Chariot uh read read Isaiah the prophet then the spirit said unto Phillip oh God still talks go near and join thyself to this Chariot and Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaias and said understandest thou what thou readest and he said how can I accept some man should guide me and he desired Phillip that would that he would come up and sit with him and the place of the scripture which he was reading was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter like a lamb dumb before her his shear and so opened he not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and the unic answered Philip and said I pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet of this of himself or some other man then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus now how did Phillip know that the that the guy was over there God knew the holy spirit that was in him led him there now watch Philip opened his mouth begin the same scripture 36th verse and they went on their way and they come into a certain water and the unic said see here is water what do hinder me to be baptized and Philip said if thou can if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and he commanded the Chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water and Philip baptized the unic and he uh uh both Philip and the unic and he baptized him and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away Phillip that the unic saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing but Phillip was found at aotus passing through the the U passing through he preached in all of the Cities till he come to cesaria Hallelujah the Holy Ghost the holy ghost moving now what would you kids think about that the Lord just moving you from pawy and then all of a sudden you're somewhere else amen that's what the first church had that was the power and the glory of that first church amen amen I I you know you you um you think about Paul's conversion amen uh uh they're the Apostle Paul did you know that it was just a common believer ananas matters of fact you want to read let's just read over there real quickly to 10 uh page or chapter 10 and um we'll look here at the 39th verse I believe it is praise the Lord Lord maybe amen you know what I don't I don't have that I have 10 to 17 but I didn't I didn't put the chapter down praise the Lord you love him amen okay yeah yeah so we're at the ninth chapter all right so so Paul the Apostle Paul the one who wrote the New Testament he was now he was one that that was out to kill the Apostle Paul was the one that young man that they said that held the coat of the guys who were stoning Steven to death that was the Apostle Paul he was a bad man this guy this guy was the chief in the in in the in the Jewish religion and his mission was to kill all of the Christians that he could kill well and um but yet God had another plan for Saul and though Saul as evil of a man as he was he had a heart that really wanted to please the Lord and so uh he thought that he was doing doing God a good thing by killing people that that disagree with with his religion and so the the the light shines on Paul knocks him off his horse blinds the blinds Saul and so let's read let's just read here um and so uh uh he he was he was blind and and uh uh uh we we so uh on the eth verse and Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes uh 998 and when his eyes were open he saw no man's but they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus and he was three days without sight neither did he eat or drink and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananas to him said the Lord in a vision ananas he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise go into the street which is called straight and inquire of the House of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for for behold he prayeth and hath seen in a vision uh an uh a man named ananas coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then ananas answered and said Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and here he has Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel and I will show you how great things I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake and ananas went and ananas went his way and entered into the house putting his hands on him and said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy GH ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forth with and arose and was baptized and when he received meat he was strengthened and then Saul uh was then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus amen hallelujah praise the Lord you do do you understand do do you see the beauty the glory of the Lord in the church we that's is what we want in the church and if you kids haven't read the book of Acts I'd encourage you to read the book of Acts amen uh uh all of us should should go back and refresh ourselves with the book of Acts because it it is quite a amen it it it's quite a deal the the power of God was up on those men to preach the gospel to live the gospel amen the power of God was with them they but they dedicated their lives to that gospel now I want I want us to just really think here as as we as I'm not going to keep you long tonight when we think about the Gospel of Jesus Christ the church world today has made this until it's just um just making good nice little families and making uh and and and we you know we just become just church members church goers we just become good good members of society but that's not I mean it is God's God's bringing us together to be good families and things of that nature but but but we're not here to just be trained to train good families we want we we are here under under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and God has anointed us to preach the gospel set the captives free he's anointed us amen so so that the gifts of the Spirit can flow through US manifest himself through us just like he done in the Old Testament Church can you say amen I mean I mean there they they're you know the uh uh there there was there in Acts 13 you know the Apostle Paul was over there trying to preach and there's this guy this false prophet you know that was that that was over there he was prophesying and and and actually saying some good things about the about Paul and uh but but but finally Paul you know he just had enough of it and and the Bible says he turns right around and says he says uh I smite you blind you're going to be blind for uh for a while until you get your evil heart repented of and immediately the guy was blind and the Bible says that all of everyone in the city everyone feared God everyone begin to fear and to think why because God was living in vessels in that City can you say amen amen so so you know um Aunt Angie had asked about prophecy here a while back and and uh um sister sister uh Mary had had had me you know asked about the woman's um part too and um and and for you uh for you ladies um that the scriptures say I got to thinking about this and I have there's three things in the book of there there's three things in the New Testament acts 2:16 it says your sons and your daughters shall prophesy sons and your daughters shall prophesy acts 21 and9 we we can just turn there real quickly before we dismiss here tonight amen acts 21 and um let's see the eth verse and the next day that uh the next day that we were of Paul's company Departed and came into cesaria and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist which was one of the seven and Abode with him and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy so so there were there were prophecies and then of course the Apostle Paul comes in in 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter and and the fifth verse is every woman who prays or prophesies having her head uncovered dishonor her head and so prophecy is is is is something that is that is that is meant for the man and the woman it's part of it it's not it's it's not teaching it's not of anything of that nature there so God can use God can use you girls in Prophecy God can use you you you boys in Prophecy he can use mamas and daddies in any of those nine spiritual gifts I I I I think you know as as as I was asked here uh you know it's been a little while ago and and and and you know brother PR had asked me you know why why don't we see more of it where amen and and and my my thoughts were pretty simple on it I said we don't desire it we've got too many other things that we're most most people are just happy just coming to church and and and and no don't even think about the ministry aspect of it and and um and so we we we don't we don't travail and and get into that place with God to where God can uh uh move upon us but I I that word there if you look there in the Greek word where he says uh you know to desire desire you know uh desire to prophesy or whatever that that word desire comes comes uh from the Greek word zeu and and it means to burn with a Zeal to deep be deeply committed to something to settle one's heart and to be completely intent on so so what the Apostle Paul was saying is hey you know and I I've got a lot more of these scriptures here that we could we could go through and um but but the the the the thing is is is remember we got to remember what our day is our day is lukewarmness how many knows what lukewarmness is how how many you girls what what does lukewarm mean that's right not hot or cold you amen you drink your coffee hot or cold amen according to the War Room not supposed to drink it amen uh lukewarm so so we we want we we don't want to be lukewarm you know there ain't going to be no girls marry you girl boys if if you're lukewarm about the relationship there there's not going to be you're not going to succeed in your job on your job if it's you're just lukewarm about it you you're not you're not going to be promoted you're not going to be you're not going to make any money for the for the guy cuz all you're there to do is to get you a paycheck and you're just doing the minimal just to keep from getting fired well you know that's that's that's okay I guess but if someone else comes along and can do your job better amen uh I I job security is doing everything you can to make your boss money and I promise you you're going to climb up in the company you'll do that but you're not going to climb up in the company as long as you're just you know just barely making an end and you're just barely doing the bare minimum and you're not work you're not willing to do over time you're not willing to do you know uh uh uh to go in early occasionally you're not wor you're not wor you're you're not you're not willing to jump in and to do those kinds of things you know when when you you you're you're not you're you're lukewarm you're lukewarm and and you get nowhere you get nowhere with that kind of an attitude God is saying I wish that you would just say I don't want nothing to do with you or I wish you would just be on fire and say I'm willing I'm ready use me anoint me I want to do my purpose you brother brandom says that every one of us are saved to work we're let me be what you want me to be let me be the best I can be that's right now in the natural you're going to show up early you know you're going to work late you're going to you're going to do what you can to help promote the the company but in the kingdom of God Amen you you you you're you're going to come to the Lord in prayer and you're going to say Lord here I am Use Me Lord use me today I I I want your blessings Lord if you filled with the Holy Ghost I know there's gifts in my life use me I I want those gifts to be used oh God show me amen I I I I want you see we how long has it been since you've told the Lord that well well well you're a bum you're you're a bum if you're not asking the Lord what he's wanting you to do you you you you've got to be working you got to be doing something for the Lord can you say amen I want to be doing something for the Lord amen now I'm not saying getting up and and start trying to make things happen I'm talking about there's nine spiritual gifts laying in the church oh God oh God let your Holy

you're as you're reading and going through the and look at the continuity at the beginning of the book of Acts it says oh Theophilus the mighty works that Christ both began to do and continues to do Christ was already gone but he said he's continuing to do it but he's doing it through us you read you read where Jesus was saying my me is to do the will of him that's s me his whole desire everything about Christ everything about Christ was to be about the father's business everything about me oh I've got some repenting to do I want to be about the father's business Amen in your prayer life don't pray an empty prayer but while you're praying you've got you've got a priz to press toward you got a goal to push toward and that is God manifesting himself through me now I I I don't I don't have to go to Africa or have to go to Japan or have to go to no God's anointed me right here brother Josh and brother Dylan are are are are going to be heading up to to Poland and Czech Republic
