father we'll give you you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say Amen I'm thankful tonight that we have this blessed hope in the Lord Jesus Christ and that he is our deliverer and our savior amen and I I I just know amen Victory Is Ours and Denise is a child of God we just we're not put putting up with that nonsense we're going to keep r on and believe in the Lord amen I'd like to read here in the The Book of Romans the 8th chapter amen and um we um as we ministered uh this morning on the could the real you step forward I'm I want to continue my thoughts but tonight we're going to we're going on a title of stepping up to the plate amen so I picked something from I didn't even know it was a movie The or a TV show until I looked at it yesterday I wondered well where is that could the real man stand step uh come forward and the the real you and U it's used a lot but it was coined there in in the 50s and um and so tonight I I think U am man we need to step up to the place L as Believers can you say Amen Romans 8 and the first verse therefore or there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after after the spirit the things of the spirit may the Lord add His blessings to his word you can have your seats here tonight amen so we we look here as we continue on with our with our thoughts this evening the real you amen is not this flesh you will never be able to amen uh to to to do it but to understand that amen this life within you is is an incredible thing it did not just start um at your birth but you were a son from all times you're not a son today amen you didn't just have a beginning here the life of God is within you brother bradam would say death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity they stepped out uh uh into the space of time and will return back to Eternity eternity dropped down in a body called time and then it goes right back into eternity again it cannot perish amen so he's talking about you you came from eternity you're living in a body in that that is a house amen and this this you you had fallen your soul had fallen that is true amen just everything had fallen and uh everything about Humanity there is nothing about Humanity that that is any good amen everything about you is is is worthless but everything about God is eternal everything about this flesh there is there is no good found in any of you amen but everything about God matters of fact the the the uh Apostle Paul there in Romans 7 7 24 says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death and and I I I was I was thinking about this Humanity how that we man we have we you you there's no pulling you there's no picking you up you cannot pick yourselves up by your own bootstraps there's there's no way to to to to overcome the spirit of Oppression and depression there's no way amen in in in these cases like like Denise and that that blood pressure when the doctors have tried everything and they can't they can't do it matters of fact I you know I I think those doctors uh uh a lot you know that's why they practice medicine just trying to figure out what's going on you know amen and it and it seems that everything about us is is is falling and and our soul was in that condition uh uh uh when you're when the soul was out of it place when it was out of its position all of nature just just is is Satan just plays havoc with everybody amen all nature and and it reminded me of of a of of of a story that brother brandham was talking about Billy Paul and how that Billy Paul instead of me telling it it's going to be a little bit lengthy but I'm going to read the story to you amen he says two uh two years three years ago Billy Paul got into a habit and got running around there and and that's the reason I had to send him to waah hatchee to the school our public school with a bunch of those the little boys and things all smoking cigarettes and things and and Billy come come up home one day and how you getting along Daddy and I seen a vision pop over him and I said come here a minute I want to talk to you and he said what is it Daddy I said what are you doing smoking cigarettes and he says I'm not and I said don't you lie to me Billy he commenced to crying and and he well he said I I I I won't do it no more Daddy and and he went on out and he and he kept on doing it and he wasn't hiding it he can't hide it um no no so I seen a vision and the Lord showed me that billing it Billy had disobeyed me and it jumped through a window and was going laughing Head Over Heels like that down on through eternity turning over and over when I come out of the vision I was screaming to the top of my voice oh God don't take my boy only boy I have don't take him Lord and I was screaming to the top of my voice I told Billy and so Billy that day he went fishing and been hanging down on the on the river a lot and there was a a a a man from India there to see me and some more ministers and and went down into New Albany and and uh with my w with with my wife and she had to uh go down there to get get something another so uh we we went down and and I I was sitting talking to the min SS and and all at once something said get out of here real quick and I I thought it was just my imagination and I said well now Brethren we're going to go to India as soon as as as we can possibly can and something says get out of here get to yourself I got out of the car and I said excuse me Brethren just a minute I I went around the corner and and I I went around and I looked no one was looking and I said father what is it he said go to Billy Paul at once and I I run back real quick and M was coming up the street and my wife and I I said hurry honey hurry something's wrong with Billy and we run and jumped in the car and took out to Jeffersonville about five or six miles and I went into the yard my mother-in-law standing in the yard and screaming to the top of her voice and she said Billy's dying come come you uh got him at the hospital and I said what happened and she said well he come down here and he had a sore throat and he was afraid uh you was going to catch him with a sore throat and tell him he was smoking cigarettes and and he went down and your good friend the doc the best doctor there is in in the nation one of the best Sadir gave him a a shot of penicillin and swelled up about that big in just about 3 minutes and he come up there and wrapped him in blankets and rushed him to the hospital and I I ran out real quick and and here come the doctor like that and took off his hat and Billy I've killed your boy I said oh doc surely not and I run into the room and they had oxygen over him and everything and pumping and giving adrenaline into his over his heart and and he just his his heart going on down and down and I said could could I be with him a minute and so he he walked he just walked out of the room and I knelt down put my hands upon him and I said dear God please hasn't my heart been broken enough in these days in my days please Jesus oh oh God give my boy another chance Lord please I ask that you that you with all my heart as your servant if you'll spare the life of my boy he's he's so good to me and helps in the meetings and he's loyal to me I need him God please don't take him I ask you not and I looked and I saw a vision of him falling like that turning over and over like like it was a couple nights before and when I've seen the vision and I I seen two big arms come out and catch him like this and start bearing him right back up going right back up like that and I raised up and Billy turned around just as black as he could be and his lips swell way out and his eyes are turned real red and turned black or turned back and I he said daddy where are you daddy where are you Daddy and I said I'm standing right here honey it's all over now amen I thought of this is is I as we seen the the prophet's son and how that amen falling and falling and falling I think that is Humanity falling and falling sons of God falling and falling you through eternity and there was no hope for the sons of God now Billy Billy was a Son of God he was a son of brother brandham but he was also a Son of God and and amen and as Billy was in his sin and having a hard time overcoming amen those things but yet as as the prophet of God seen him falling and Fallen but then there was two arms that reached out and caught him and bore him back up and I I think of of Fallen Humanity the Fallen Sons every one of you were Fallen amen every one of you living and you're still living in a fallen body and your soul amen would have went straight to hell if it had not been for the grace of God but it was the blood of Jesus Christ amen that caught your fallen so as the song says amazing grace shall always be my song of Praise amen and it it it was that amazing grace that caught my falling soul and brought me back to him now I I want to say it is nothing but Grace it is you'll never be good enough for your salvation you'll never be good enough for heaven you'll never ever be good enough amen for any anything it was God's good pleasure at the beginning amen that called you and ordained you amen God sent Jesus amen to redeem you back you were always a son someone say I was always a son and God was going to do what it was what what he had to do to redeem you and to bring you back to him amen aren't you glad for those two big arms that God Amen brought you to himself hallelujah amen but God couldn't condemn the soul with that house that you were living in amen so what did God do God redeemed that Soul amen brought you back to himself so here you are tonight you're sitting in the same old house amen yes amen uh uh uh sin has you've taken down a lot of the amen the the the the things that on your old house that that that God doesn't approve of Amen but you're living in that same old house you're you've Sanctified that house to yourself it's not a house of sin anymore it's a it's a house that a Son of God and the spirit of God could live in can you say Amen but the house is still condemned the house is still going to fail and you'll never be able to judge your spiritual walk with that house house amen now I now I I I do do you believe that amen now brother Brandon would say he says before the foundation of the world that's when your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life that's when the lamb was slain God spoke the word it was in his thinking in his thought and he spoke the word and everything happened just at that at that time this is just God's seed materializing that's all it's his words coming down so the reality was back there you were with God you wrot to it you were a clinker off of God if you will you rotated off of God Amen but you see you came in your decreed season amen now you were still Fallen you're living in a fallen body but he says now when the light of God flashes across that quickly the seed recognizes it because it's born of God Amen so when the light of God flashes across that seed it recognizes it and it comes to life amen he says now it's Abraham's seed for knowledge by God that's why the light flashes is to catch that s i aren't you glad for the arms of God that's why God sends a prophet Amen to catch the sons of God Amen to bring you to your potential amen now the problem has never been with the blood of Jesus the problem has never been with the power of Jesus Amen but why is the church in the condition that it has been in amen it's because the church has and and I and I want to speak a little bit on concerning your your position and your amen the privilege of sons to be able to act as Sons why why don't we see the the the believer acting like sons of God and amen with with Divine faith and and and overcoming like you see amen uh like like there should be you know all over the world Amen I I believe a lot of it has been is because uh uh the the the church hadn't come to that maturity amen there's been a few men that has risen up over the years amen that and good Godly men over throughout the church history amen but as a whole the Son of God had never really come to that to that uh that that that conclusion as Adam was that he was a Son of God and that he can is the possessor of all things and and that he can he can he can stand up regardless of what anyone says or does Amen but I want to say this is the season this is the adoption of sons this is the this is the age of maturity this is the age where the son is understanding wait a minute I this I'm not I'm not looking in I I you know I I I preached over at uh there in Arkansas at brother Ben's meeting and I amen and I I I said you know when when we were dealing with the amen and when Jesus was adopted and and he went up to the mountain and there was they there was Moses and Elijah and Jesus and and the disciples were wanting to make a denomination out of it and and wanting to Amen to lift Moses up and to lift Elijah up and amen and then the cloud came down and overshadowed amen and all they could see was nothing but Jesus and in this adoption season amen I believe that's what we are looking at here today amen denominations are over a a lifting man above another man is over uh you know the the the position and rankling for trying to find the ranks listen we've got one position and that is in the Lord Jesus Christ we're not looking to be Amen to be loved by a Manor or to be lifted up in some pedestal in this season we have come to the understanding we are sons of God not sons of men sons of God can you say amen amen oh yes it used to be a you know this one would take you out and you would you would just fall apart or this one you know this one lifted you up and you felt so proud but we're in the day amen where we're not looking to a man amen approval about anything we're looking to the word of God we're looking to God and what his call is for our lives can you say amen amen so the problem has never been the blood the problem has never been the word the problem has been maturity Hallelujah but I'm here to tell you God sent us a prophet and said this is the age for maturity this is the age for maturity amen this is the age where sons of God shouldn't have to be amen reminded all the time of what what the prophet said you know you know get get to church early so that you can be a part Play Your Part in in the services because you count and you're a part of the body or amen you should you should be at church all the time or no we're beyond all of that this isn't this isn't py little diaper changing ceremonies anymore this is sons of God taking responsibility to themselves and saying I am going to stand I am a son can you say amen amen I I'm not doing it for you you're not doing it for me we're doing it because we are sons of God and the prophet has declared what those matured Sons would look like amen so as we look before it was always trying to find a way trying to to find uh a way for the power of God to fall amen if we could I if if we could pray this long the power of God would fall if we could uh if we could do this certain thing the power of God will fall listen we are Sons we don't have to find some way for the power of God to fall we've got to recognize who we are amen amen but we judge too many things by the feelings well I don't feel like it I don't feel like going to church well I don't feel like praising I don't feel it you're you're judging you're judging you are you are lifting your feelings above that of the word so it takes a Son of God and you can only do it if you're a son you can only do it if you've got the Holy Ghost to stand up and say no I'm a Son of God I'm going to live according to what God has laid out for this age Hallelujah now now brother Brandon was saying you know as as I quoted that quote and I bewildered some of you this morning amen and you can say well and this is right before he passed away this is 65 12565 and things that are to be he says you can say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you now you're thinking now what does that mean he's saying if you're not a son the Holy Ghost will never have its effect if you're not a son well you jump and shout and you'll have all kinds of things he says the real gift is your soul down in there that was born of God that controls this whole thing to the word of God and the will of God and there you will grow up see then you're a son and daughter of God you're a child of God Amen goes on he says well I I'm I'm Pentecostal I belong to that I he says if you don't line up with that word there is something wrong wrong see your real father ain't God because that real start in your soul before there was even a spirit it was your soul that Soul didn't come from God then it wasn't the germ of God to begin with you're deceived you're in a patch of weeds bearing the world's record of the weeds coming forth acting like the world loving the world and it's because the love of God is not even in you so here we stand today as the sons of God Amen what is taking place we're in the age of maturity this is we're not looking at things through rose-colored glasses like children and saying well you know well I you know I well that's just an opin that no no no no we're sons of God someone asked me one time Amen brother W boy You Don't Preach very many hard messages anymore I I said I preached 35 years of hard messages and it never changed a person about it never changed a person the elect you don't have to hit them over the head and keep hitting them over the head they're going to follow the word of God so if they want to be in the tribulation or if they I don't know all I know is this is the age of maturity and brother bradam says the tutor is no longer over his shoulder all the time saying you shouldn't do that you shouldn't do that hey hey hey no the son has stepped up to its Rank and position and believes the word as God believes it Hallelujah can you say Amen now what does this do this is not just a narcissist father saying all right now I've got total control over my son amen and and now I'm going to put you over the business but I I and and and he's just manipulating and controlling no he's raising the son to think along like he does like he thinks amen now Hallelujah I and when it comes to Papa God he knows how to run the business he knows how to run the business can you say am man see so the problem has never been the blood the blood has been there to get us along amen but remember God's intention was for this day to bring us to that place that God has in him well can you say amen amen amen so the problem you our problem today is not in the word is not in the power is not in the spirit of God or in the blood of God Amen it is simply we need sons of God to quit worshiping their house and understand that they are the sons of God it's not this it's this can you say Amen now brother bradam would say he says now there's people in the world today after 2000 years of gospel preaching don't know what it is to be born again of the spirit of God they don't know what omnipotence means what that God in his great omnipotent power can transform a soul from a street sinner to an Angelic position in the God's kingdom as a son and daughter of God they don't know it they're too taken up or infatuated with the things of this world can you say amen amen now a but brother but brother brandham would go would go one and he would say now God in these last days is going to draw true hearts from everywhere someone shout hallelujah no matter how much counterfeit and chaff the devil has God will rise his church I right out of it it'll be a ceiling for sure as just as

worry God is waiting and trying and pressing to get the mystery of God revealed to his church amen that's what's holding back the coming of Christ now and the great Millennium is this great Supernatural power that's really laying dormant in the church it's in someone says it's in me the power now what now one more time he says he says that's what's holding back the coming of Christ now in the great Millennium is this great Supernatural power that's really laying dormant in the church now now here we stand Hallelujah now I I like watching these these kids grow up and um uh I it's

working on their house and we love those kids being there but my job was to get them into a position of sunship yes all right can you say amen hallelujah amen Hallelujah I'm going to embarrass Dylan but those boys have stayed at my house every Wednesday night every Wednesday night uh uh Dylan and Austin stayed at my house uh since they were little babies amen and uh uh they they they just said and and that that went all the way up until they they they they started getting their jobs uh but just just last year just this last year amen they they haven't stayed at my house very much at all amen and and I I I loved it you know of course they they would help here work at the church they were here every day and uh so we sort of had us a little a little uh deal we'd get up early amen you remember that Dylan we'd get up early and go fishing every morning while we were building the church we got up we were out at you know I don't know 6:00 and and would spend a couple hours and fishing and and then we'd come over here and work till midnight and uh uh you know but but now but but the thing is amen uh uh they they they got to the point where they can fish they got their license they don't need me to take them fishing anymore they got nicer trucks than I do amen and and got got all of these things going on you see they're growing up right all right they're maturing on now my role is changing they're no longer they went to the hill for the first time last year without me Hallelujah to go hunt and it was just like I was just like I was I was beside myself I was thinking no one needs me anymore hallelujah amen you see you see they they they grow up are y'all hearing me you see now that's what God is wanting see we want God to do everything for us God's given the authority to the church the authority to the church is for you to stand upon the unfall word of God and make that word to live in your situation that's right but we can't but he can't have you falling apart every time amen uh the the the your your little world comes to an end and then you fall apart aren't you to control your little world aren't you to control and to stand as a Son of God Amen with authority yes sir can you say amen amen the beginning of man has never changed we lost it but the commission to man is still the same we are to have dominion and Authority you say no that's going to be in the Millennium that's not what brother brandham said brother brandham says the beginning of man is what God redeemed us back to now he man he says now man was a secondary God on Earth and again this was this is found in the fundamental foundation for faith that I would encourage each of you to listen to he was given the power to control all things all the elements of the earth that was Adam Adam was given these great powers and that church do that Hallelujah and then that church was given to to uh uh but but then the power that he was given to make his choice is where he fell and Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak speak to the trees and they' Obey him they could speak to the wildlife and it would obey him he could speak to the waters every what it was and everything obeyed Adam that was the beginning of man that's what God give him the power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power then he become unconscious of the fact after losing relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father then he lost all of that and all of these great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring us back to its original again now we know the last thing is to be this body but this body never did have control come on the control was given to the soul the body was created in the next chapter right all right your soul was created in the image of God and that Soul has been restored back into communion and fellowship with God now amen but as long as you're a kid you're a servant as long as you're a child you're a it does matter how you Buck against the word of God and how you respect the word of God and how you come on now now there's there's there's there's hundreds of quotes where the comforter amen where the where where where where the uh the tutors coming back to the father and says well she bucks your word here he bucks your word there he just constantly saying well well well Amen brother Brandon there are literally hundreds of quotes where he's talking about this amen I want to say and maybe maybe hundreds is an exaggeration dozens of quotes amen amen dozens of quotes of where the tutors coming back to the father and said listen you can't be proud of him yes yes they're coming along but they're not mature enough to take over anything praise the Lord but that doesn't stop the fact that you are a son of God and I say I want to be in a Rapture God help me to mature in my faith help me to mature to say God if you said it I believe it if you said it I believe it I am going to come under that headship of what this amen of what that cloud represents can you say amen amen now now you say now brother wend I I I I think that I I think that you just you know all right you just sit there and keep on listening Hallelujah brother brandham says he says now when God and a Believer meets there's two omnipotence a man is a part of God he is a Son of God and that's what little and and what and what little he is joins with the entire body now and and and Jesus said over in Mark 11:22 if you say to this mountain and be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said it will come to pass believe what you said and a Christian is so marked that around him is an atmosphere now now he's talking about faith that can only come to that Son of God you believe what you you said and a Christian is so marked with around him with that atmosphere amen now is that pretty simple amen the atmosphere of a Believer atmosphere of a Christian is I believe World falls apart I believe oh God how how many would love how many would love for the for the tutor to come back to Papa and say listen I have tried him with everything her with everything and all I get is I believe I I the world is falling apart right now I'm sending this and this and it's coming back they're hitting every which direction I know it's time amen and papa I know they're ready for the next phase they're ready for this amen I have sent everything their way amen I've sent sickness I've sent trials I've done this I've sent that Hallelujah and they're standing there with that atmosphere of facei saying I believe I a son God never allows anything to come my way except amen it's for my Gooden can you say Amen man now brother brandham says the greatest success I have ever had was among people who could hardly read or write cuz they ain't trying to figure it out they simply believe yes the Miracles that I've had some of my greatest Miracles that I remember Amen in my life has has been among the natives amen that that just simply believe the word of God I remember I I I remember way up in in Red Lake right way way up there in Northern panum amen real close in the Hudson Bay and and I I I I remember you know these guys were in their own long language and I'm happen to use an interpreter and and I'm and I'm I'm a a a uh I come down praying and as I'm praying for people amen I I just I just pray for this old this this this poor man they're all poor just praying for him and he stopped and squeezed me well I look at him as as I'm praying and he's got eyes wide open tears in his eyes and he starts speaking to me well I don't understand a word he's saying and uh then he gets a little irritated so we finally get The Interpreter over he says he just spoke to me in in uh in the cre uh what whatever amen cre of jibway or amen what what what is it yeah yeah yeah then that in that cre there's a mix mixture of him there and and he just you just you just told me something from the Lord told me what I had said and I'm thinking well great day I don't know any kind of Korean I don't know any kind of OJ Bo but God just came down specially for that man who had come to that service looking for something from the Lord he so desperately needed to hear from the Lord and the Lord used me and I didn't even I I wasn't speaking in cre or a Gibble but it was God to a poor man that didn't even know English and God spoke to him are y'all hearing me Oh Glory I think we're too educated we get too we get we we think this thing too much I say we need to keep our Doctrine simple I I you know listen Stephanie Stephanie barely knew what the Red Sea was when the Lord healed her she barely knew anything she just simply believed and I would tell her and there she was acting like a little child oh just so giddy and as we're as I tell her little bible stories and amen and how God's still the same today and she just oh my and I wasn't even thinking about her liver I was just tell I was just trying to catch her up fast track Sunday school on steroids you know amen get her get get get her all ready to go so she'll understand something that's going on in the church services but you know what happened it was was that little childlike faith and she just believed it and God gave her a brand new she was only here for what 2 3 months amen only here just that long when God gave her a brand new liver there wasn't a lot of mush that she had to come through she just went all this time saying that God wasn't real amen agnostic atheist and but when she found out that God was real and that God could do things and she seen some testimonies for herself she just says well then God can heal me too come on simp faith I think I think we need to get back to that Simplicity now our teaching is to get your focus not on yourself but on the position of your soul so even our teaching should not be intellectual no please don't be intellectual let it minister to that heart now he says the greatest success I've ever had hardly was those that could hardly read or write now I'm not support I'm not trying to support my ignorance or prejudices but I'll say the biggest hindrances the Gospel of Jesus Christ has ever had has been this modernday education you believe that amen the first conflict it goes on down the first conflict that was ever coming to the world was because somebody was seeking out worldly wisdom in instead of simple faith in God listen to this you say Dr so and so don't believe it yeah that doesn't change God's word a bit remember you're not saved by wisdom you are saved you're not saved by your education you are saved by faith in Jesus Christ forget about your education be simple in your Doctrine right forget about your education and be simple somebody say be simple in your Doctrine well what is the doctrine ABCs what did Brother brandom say he said now now he says they said now won't you teach them how to prophesy and won't you teach them how to do all this he says they got to learn their ABCs talking about the Pentecostals he said I can't teach them all these all this other stuff until they get their ABCs and the ABCs is what always believe Christ there's the ABCs he could not get the Pentecostals to believe the word so God was Hallelujah now we've got we've got a group of men uh uh out there they're retracing the prophet's footsteps now these are not in the message they're charismatic amen and um um these These are these are good man but they uh you know they're they're retracing the prophet's footsteps so they'll go they they went you know they they've been in Phoenix his last meetings there he's been they've been uh uh going to these motel rooms and these ballrooms where brother brandham where the supernatural was at and they've been getting people in and and and and and they're on they're on the internet I'm not you you can you you can you can look it up for yourself but these guys are are uh are are trying to find the glory amen what that Prophet had we can have too and so they want the glory and they're they're retrac and they're having conventions of they're having people that were there there's a brother bram's Oregan player brother bram's Oregan player uh at one of his last meetings where amen he's up there telling what exactly what happened and how how the supernatural came and how the god apparently brother Bram was supposedly said something to him and and uh and and and then you got you got these other guys and then there's you know there's some of our message ranks some some of our message preachers that are a part of it too over there and I anyways so you know so they're trying to re retrace the footsteps and they're trying to put these pieces all together and and and and and they they've missed the point this is the third pull this is the adoption of sons this is when the word has been opened up and handed to the Son of God but it's never going to do us any good if we don't believe the way God wants us to believe that's right and you cannot say oh I believe I believe I believe and you can't do the first principles of the doctrines you can't even do the first things that brother brandom tells you need you need to get right Hallelujah you said now this morning you said adoption had nothing to do with works it doesn't it has to do with maturity yeah Mama can beat these boys upside the head to keep their I I've I've watched these mamas it's so amazing to watch these kids and their masam all they've got is two more bites and they will sit there and cry and stomp and they'll they'll they'll sneak off from the table and then 10 minutes later mom looks and says Ah so they go and grab and bring them back and this thing and it and it's such a oh oh these poor kids amen life is so hard and all there is is one more spoon of biscuits left in the or whatever you know all because know what it is he said all you have to do is eat two bites or whatever amen remember that the other night I I I've seen I've seen these these these kids they now I want you to go pick now go go pick that up don't fold that in the floor and they'll throw it now now now all you have to do this will help you kids this will help you kids whenever you got if mom says to just pick it up just pick just pick it up and put it there back on the couch Mama's not mad you're not crying and y'all get to go play and Mama's [Applause] proud but that doesn't always happen no no no no no you're just going to you're going to go do your no no I told you [Music] a no put it on the C pick the pillow up and put it back dad comes in what's going on well the pillow needs to be up there instead of down here put it in there then you look at their eye and they go no Daddy ain't going to do this like Mama pick it up pick it up now it woke you kids up amen now those things God cannot give power to Sons that should be past the Rebellion stage should be totally past the rebellious stage well the prophet said well does he have scripture in verse for that the prophet was in the Supernatural real he knows that you shouldn't be visiting in the church he knows amen that it'll run the Holy Ghost offer he he says for two weeks Hallelujah he knows these things and we're Hi how are you how are you don't let window don't know but hi see that's that's that's not that's not the kind of person that he's going to take on the mountain and adopt now all of my all of my grandkids all of my grandkids can can drive they can amen my my my grandkids Hallelujah I believe in teaching them while they're young amen and we go out we'll go find a pasture or go find a dirt road somewhere and and uh amen how else do you think my truck got where it said but now they know how but responsibility you would never throw them the keys because they're not responsible enough come on their mental level is not there amen sorry you're growing you are growing amen now maturity is where we are why hasn't the church operated in the authority that Adam had is because the church has not come into that maturity up to this point right I say today if you're not careful you'll be a good boy and you the the tutor will come back to Papa and be telling Papa they're they they're they're living your word and that's all all we want but you were tutored you've been given the message you've been given adoption so that you and I can operate in the authority of sunship come on sure it's good for papa to be proud but God's given me the keys to the kingdom I'm going to take this now my prayer is going to mean something now my Bible study is going to mean something now my listening to the message is going to mean something I'm taking this are y'all understanding I am believing everything that God has put now now now look here look here what brother brandom had said amen he says now he says cut every obstacle from the human being from human beings that they might be connected like in the Garden of Eden I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did not he say in Mark 11:22 whatsoever things you say and doubt not in your heart and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said what what happens when two omnipotence meet when God and man come together through omnipotence something's got to shake whatever you say with the creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotence have met there he stands isn't he wonderful omnipotent this ain't it this you're bringing this under the control of omnipotence but the man in the house is the one that's got not the house but the man in the house now now Satan come right back around and say but you're not a son you can't because you you you know the way you know what no no no no no no no no this house is going down yeah this house is fixing to be demolished I'm fixing to move into a brand new home but while I'm here I'm still a son and I'm not going to let condemnation take me down I believe every word that God says I'm lining up with everything it's my desire to line up with that word it's my desire I'm not Bucking in rebellion and doing all that I am beyond that I know that I am put here for a reason I'm a Son of God I don't care if I fell yesterday I'm a Son of God to I don't care if I fell five minutes ago I'm a son of God God today right now I'm a Son of God right now and Satan you're not going to talk me out of my weapon whether I feel good or whether I don't feel good I'm a Son of God whether life is upside down or life isn't upside down I'm a Son of God I have been positioned in this place I've been given the word of God the Holy Ghost is right here the angels are at my disposal as I can stand on God's word and believe it brother I'm talking about God the omnipotent and his sons coming together agreeing on his word well praise the Lord praise the Lord H it's a creative power hallelujah amen it'll reach it'll it it'll just alone it'll reach way way down it'll touch every child every grandchild it'll it'll that that word that you possess is greater than anything else we've got the authority through that word it changes things we believe that word Satan wants to come in and try to take your children take your grandchildren try to come in and take your spouse you stand up and say I am not that don't you even look at my house devil amen my house might not have pretty shingles on it like others do but I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God and I'm going to believe every word that God has spoken for [Applause] me the only law that a son can work by is the law of Faith amen because you are a word creation you came rotated off that word amen now brother brandham is in a prayer line and he's talking to a lady and and he's so impressed with her faith and I just wanted to bring it in he says will you bring you you believe lady yes you're you are a Believer wish all patience come like that all the people now if the people would come with that type of faith that would be just wonderful look here sister just a moment I just want want want to see you just a moment you're a you're a Believer and you believe me too there's not a shadow of Doubt anywhere oh my good would you like the Holy Ghost to say that about you oh my word Prophet God say that about you I I'm looking at that thinking oh God forgive me of my unbelief amen he says that's the reason when you come when you was coming across the platform God healed you of that kidney trouble and so it left you uh-huh uh-huh God loves his children it's so wonderful you come from another another place here you don't belong to Evansville you come from Illinois you come up from a place that starts like Jones Johnson Johnsonville or something is that right you got a husband that's sick too and they don't don't they call him Ry or Roy something like that Roy is that isn't that right isn't that true all right you're interested in your mother no your mother-in-law I believe it is isn't that right she has something wrong with her br bronchials in in her chest that's right you can go home and you all can go get well you can all go and get well because God was so impressed God was so impressed with his daughter coming across that platform he said you believe him and you believe me too you just you're just a believer can you say amen he says now God is going to be with you God bless her Lord in in your name amen when you come friend let me let me say this to you it's your mental attitude the way you approach anything can you say Amen well glory to God keep my Doctrine simple that's good and all this that we preach I believe we preach I I I I I try I try to preach it to where the kids can understand because because I believe that kids are part of the rapturing generation too we're all we're all going to be raptured here and we are all going to we are all going to defeat Devils on our way out of here every one of us are going to defeat the enemy well I wish there was somebody enthusiastic about it it would make our song Services a little bit more pey it would make our prayer lives a little more pey it would make our our attitudes about life a little more pey if we understood that hey I've got a position here can you see man brother Brandon says my dear loving old mother-in-law sitting back here when I was telling her yesterday about it she said Billy I had a clock that I couldn't make it run said I I just couldn't stay without that clock I didn't have money to buy me another one so so she said I got down and said God make that clock run for me will you come on she said I looked up and it started running and it's just running [Applause] perfectly it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom her refrigerator she said a couple days ago days after that wouldn't it kept defrosting just just a little spot there that would hold ice and she she done everything she could she could do to keep it from defrosting or or or keep it keep it from defrosting cuz she couldn't keep her butter and stuff in it and poor old thing she's a widow her husband is in glory that's my father-in-law he gave us last testimony over here to my my left side before he went home and she got down know she didn't have money to buy another refrigerator and she said Lord will you be merciful to me again you know me start my refrigerator or you know me start my refrigerator to freezing again will you she got up and went and looked in her refrigerator and it was all froze around be simple just ask don't try to figure it out don't try to study it just believe it don't mentally figure it out just believe it from your [Applause] soul well can you say amen hallelujah Aunt Angie told me here a while back she was amen uh uh she was she was uh uh no I I believe it was Mom at first now but both of them were testifying I forget who told the story first amen but but um uh sister Angie was telling me that she had she she was she was over here um uh uh cooking and and and spilled some grease on her hand and uh and and she just you know she got worried at first cuz it was a it was a pretty good burn and she just she just reached her hand over and just prayed over it and just let it go amen and she says and then she then then she went and looked at it here uh uh you know a little while later and and there was nothing even there not a blister or anything God just totally healed her mom didn't you have the same kind of a testimony amen where is on your hand or yeah and the Lord and the Lord healed and and and it and it reminded me of this of this quote here um in in jerus and Divine Healing and and brother brandham says it's the atmosphere you got to get away from it says from that Old confusion oh I I'm going to he says you're scared that's what's the matter you'll be frying your meat of a morning for breakfast and the first thing you know you'll be filled with the Holy Spirit and I'm going to shock you a little bit a little bit you don't mind do you all right for instance the meats are frying and all at once the the grease pops out of out on your hand now if you will just shake it off and go on frying meat it won't bother you now I know you didn't get that just right look the first thing is oh where where's the unine or something and you grab your hand and it scares you to death and before you and and what does and and that's what it does it's fear he says if You' shake it off I'm a Son of God I have authority I'm bigger than that Greece did y'all read any of y'all read the testimony of Austin got ran over yesterday and uh his leg got ran over and and uh and so uh you know we were all here worried and uh you know so they they they get uh uh uh go to go take him into the Urgent Care and look and said you know he's he's didn't break anything just uh sprang his leg and it was swelled up and uh so he was hobbling around on it so he's hobbling through the prayer line last night at at Youth Camp and and uh and and and you know he hobbled back to his seat and he back there in the back and uh uh W with with the other guys he says then all of a sudden he says the pain just went away and he started stomping on that thing and and uh uh walking and here he is today amen not sore nothing God just came down and healed but the but you know the doctors have said he had just had a bad Spring Pulling the muscles and and and and that sort of thing and and and but it was it was it was somebody listen folks this is a reality Christianity is a reality you're a son and that should be a reality you're not a son because you're good you're not a son because you go to church you're not a son because you listen to every word you're a son because God called you his son you came from the loins of God you are a son you're not a pig that has been turned to a sheep you always were a sheep you're not a sinner that became a son you always were a son you got to believe it can you say amen amen now he says Peter walking on the water he was walking all right till he seen the waves contrary and he got scared and Jesus said why' you fear that's what's the matter with the Holy Ghost people today they've got a lot of afraid amen the devil's just trying to scare you out of something he's trying to put something off somewhere else when and say well some of these days you'll do this you are now the devil says one of these days if he can keep you believing that you you it's not going to come because a magic comes on you because God's got a special place the magical place is the adoption of sons that has been given to us through 1963 on top of that mountain that word is to mature us to believe the word of God Amen right I don't believe we're going to see less Miracles I believe we're going to see more miracles it's not going to be a

Heavenly places now we we have all powers in heaven and earth now we have it not in the Millennium we won't need it then we got it now we're right now sons of God does not appear what we shall be but

fixing to take you to a home without Decay amen I'll never need a new roof it'll never need no more hair it'll never need no oh come on Church you're going to be free to live who you are just like Adam did in the beginning before the fall amen he says now then first thing you know little old Martha coming out there and she said Lord Oh I like that she titled him what he was he was her Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died see and said even now whatever you ask of God God will give it to you nothing uncertain about that no see see that's when two positives meet now now he's fixing to show us don't get flustered she told him if you would have been here but even now even now and she addressed him he says now that's when two two positives meet that's when two omnipotence meet have you noticed that we have talked about two omnipotence on three or four different quotes here tonight he's trying to tell us something here two omnipotence meet when one omnipotent she had she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ Christ was omnipotent she had perfect infinite faith in Christ that he was the Lord and know whatever he asked of God God would give it in other words she said you just speak the word that's all you have to do whatever you ask God God will give it to you that's omnipotence all powerful cause he just said so all right he was all powerful and that's when the two Powers two omnipotent Powers meets together it's a contact then and when a line here has got 150 votes and then and and this has got 150 votes when you put them both together you've got 150 boats both ways and when you've got supreme power that's a little bit of uh electrical lingo for us guys amen and when you've when when Jesus said lay hands on the sick and you shall recover you've got supreme faith in that being the truth you need a supreme god that made a supreme promise and a supreme result will come a supreme god with a supreme promise from a Supreme Being believing with a supreme faith will bring the results can you say amen amen one more one more place in omnipotence he says omnipotence is speaking angels are appearing prophets are coming prophets are prophesying Visions are being poured out the gospels being preached the sicks being healed being raised up the blind sees the deaf here devils are raging impersonators Janice and jambers are here but I'm an speaks we're in the last days we're at that Junction can you say amen amen hallelujah brother Brandon would say you got to start somewhere where am I going to start somewhere all right somewhere I like that somewhere I think to start somewhere yeah start right there right where you are and from this day forward I'm going to walk in a faith that faith is not away from you and I hope my message this morning and tonight it's all coming I hope it's all resonating it's not away from this body it's in this body the faith has been restored right perfect word brings perfect Faith Can you say Amen you say well now brother brandom I don't know whether I can move my hand or not you'll never move it as long as you think it think that believe that he's done it and go say he's done it and act like he's done it move it an inch if you can't move move it then let's take then if you can't move it let's take it all move it a little bit further the next day I'll move it a little bit further a little further the next day I'll move it a little further Satan says that's as far as you can go say oh no I'm going on keep on with it stay with it great faith will bring you out right now little faith will bring you on out anyhow if you'll just stay with it you know what that's telling me that just includes dummies like me great faith will produce the miracle but little faith we'll bring it right on out just stay with it Hallelujah can you say Amen do you believe God still does Miracles y'all believe God still raises the dead y'all believe God still moves amen mountains I believe it he said a little faith will bring you on out in if you'll just stay with it just when you see the the of light follow it stay with it it'll bring you out and then brother mam says oh my oh my bless the Lord amen oh God don't let me come don't let this be a religious thing that I just doing my little I want to be so intertwined with Papa I want to be so intertwined that that I don't even question him I just it's just if I hear it if I see it I just do it I want to be that part I want I want I want him to be so proud of me and I want to be so proud of him and I I I want his word to be my absolute and and I want to rejoice in the fact that he says don't be don't Rejoice that devils are subject to you rejoice that your name is written in heaven don't don't rejoice in that Rejoice that you've got something in your heart remember the first quote that we that that that that we read amen this is the one that I read this morning or I quoted this morning I'm going to read it back to you again he says now you say I've got the baptism the Holy Ghost he says that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you did you know that Judas was there with the 70 when they came up and said have we not have we not done all of these things he said even the devils are subject to us and Jesus says don't rejoice in that Rejoice because your name is written in heaven are you hearing me because the 70 found that that was just a temporal blessing their names weren't or at least uh some you know the disciples it was a mixed audience right we know the 70 left the 12 stayed amen and then one of the 12 ended up going to and they all came back rejoicing but he wasn't preaching to those wannab bees he said rejoice that your name is in heaven it's not a temporal blessing to you he says the real gift is in your soul down in there see that was born of God that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God and there you grow up you're a son and daughter you're a child of God he says in these things as you come up like the mother now you're in vowels of the earth trying to come forth you're a son of God God coming forth you see the word of God I should do this I should be born again well I belong to church well I that that don't that don't mean a thing I'm a Methodist my mother that's good for your mother well I'm Pentecostal I belong to that if you don't line up with the word then there's something wrong then you see your real father ain't God because the real start is in your soul before there was a spirit it was your soul and the Soul didn't come come if the soul didn't come from God then it wasn't a germ of God to begin with you're deceived you're in a patch of weeds bearing the world's record of weeds coming forth acting like the world loving the world because the love of God is not in you now that's many who are out there Pentecostals are the it's the largest denominate it's the largest group in the world as far as the Christian group the Pentecostals is is is umbrella is incredible and they're rejoicing that they've got it but God says I'm interested in sons and you're not Sons because you're obeying you're obeying because you're a son you're not Sons because you got it together you you got it together in your soul therefore you can believe and bring all the chaos and bring the impossibility into a possibility oh yeah can you say amen amen do you love him I love him yes I love him because you first love me and purchase my salvation [Music] on treat you can go with a or C yes I love him because he first love me and puras my salvation on C it's because you love me that I can love you oh let's sing it with conviction Now sing it make it personal I love you I love you because you [Music] first he's empowered you with a soul to believe and pray just my salvation [Music] on aren't you glad when all the when all of the Miracles that I have seen I and I have seen I I've been blessed I've just been blessed to see about everything uh the blind eyes open cripples walk tumors disappear I've been so fortunate for the Lord to hear prayer i' I've seen I've seen a lot of it but at the end of the day if my name wasn't on that book if at the end of the day I wasn't a son it would do me no good I'm rejoicing tonight to have my name in that book oh sons of God Daughters of God aren't you glad to have your name in that book it's not because you're good it's not because you've got it together the genetics of God the gene seed of God is in [Music] you and you have the ability to believe despite all of your weaknesses and failures you have the ability to overcome despite all of the turmoil that comes against you throughout your uh uh uh uh your daily walk there's something within you that believes God I would rather have that than to have some great superpower faith that can be [Music] impersonated the Apostle Paul says though I had Faith to move all mountains and yet I don't love him then it would do me no good aren't you glad you love him [Music] but the power comes with it the glory comes with it I believe we're walking in an a I believe we're we're we're we're we're we're we're God allows these situations to come Hallelujah I was telling someone yesterday I said what if God's putting all the little pieces together of what if this is the final test to take you to the next your next level say are the levels of course you plate toe off God will send things your way it's time to you go up higher and you're going to keep going higher we're in the Rapture right now folks it's your soul that is rapturing he's cutting you off cut you things where these materialistic things around you is just no longer important to you he wants him and him alone he wants his word and that faith in his word alone do you want that here tonight Lord cut everything else off from me let get cut cut cut cut all cut cut all nonsense away from me let me believe you and you alone it's not

[Music] yes yeah yeah yeah wonderful praise the Lord isn't God so wonderful oh yes he's so wonderful I love him I love him so much am I worthy of his love not one looking in the mirror [Music] not looking at my track record but he thinks I'm worthy of it he thinks I'm worthy are you worthy well that might be subject of debate between some people but to him [Music] the prophet says if you were the only one if you were the only one he would still come for you that's his love for his people he loves you tonight and when Papa gives you the kingdom you don't have to sit back and say I'm not worthy you're very much worthy you're his son you're his daughter can you say Amen we we believe what he says [Music] salvation on [Music] C amen amen amen amen God bless you there's a sweetness here
