[28:08] him besides our
[28:11] praise that's why I come to church on
[28:14] these Wednesday nights on these Sundays
[28:16] is not to sit there and look
[28:19] pretty but is to give him the love and
[28:22] the praise that he deserves whether I'm
[28:26] sick whe whether I'm not feeling well
[28:28] whether I'm going through the biggest
[28:30] mind Battle of my
[28:32] life when I step through those doors I'm
[28:35] giving him everything that I can

[28:40] strength to do it whether I've had my
[28:42] wisdom teeth pull like sister
[28:44] cayle is when I step through those doors
[28:47] everything else means nothing to me I
[28:50] don't care what I look like I don't care
[28:51] if I have snot slung everywhere I don't
[28:54] care if my eyes are swollen from the
[28:56] tears that were shed I have promised
[28:58] myself that in 2024 when I step through
[29:01] those doors I'm going to give my every
[29:06] thing I'm going to pour it out no matter
[29:09] how much it
[29:11] hurts no matter how much pride I have to
[29:15] swallow I'm come to give the Lord the
[29:17] praise because he's worthy of it you're
[29:20] not worthy of it he's worthy of the
[29:23] praise he's worthy of the admiration
[29:27] Jesus was thinking of this song Today
[29:29] sister CA if we can try that tonight
[29:32] before we get ready to turn the the
[29:35] service
[29:36] over but thinking of this song that hit
[29:39] me on the way home like I said today has
[29:40] been something special for me was it's
[29:43] been different and the song hit me on
[29:45] the way home and it say seems every time
[29:49] we go to his
[29:52] throne we bring petitions but forgive
[29:56] Our Song
[29:59] asking questions like Lord how or
[30:03] why or just complain about how hard we
[30:10] try but if he were to ask this
[30:16] time this might be the question one is
[30:24] mine Don't You Think You Are to worship
[30:28] me oh Lord don't you think it's time to
[30:33] spend some
[30:36] time with your hands up in the air of
[30:40] more than just your prayer and give me
[30:43] what is rightly
[30:46] mine yes it's true I want to hear from
[30:52] you all your questions and your every
[30:56] need
[30:59] give me all your doubts and fears but
[31:02] there's more I want to hear time for you
[31:06] to worship
[31:09] me prayer alone can go so far yes but
[31:15] mixed with praise he meets us where we
[31:19] are we can't you see him as a helping
[31:25] ha he's so much more for he's The Great
[31:29] I
[31:31] Am for all his kindness he won't ask
[31:37] much he only wants us to show him my
[31:44] love don't you think you want to work
[31:48] he's asking that question tonight don't
[31:51] you think it's time you spend some
[31:55] time with your your hands up in the air

[41:24] hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and sth
[41:28] all that he hath and buth that
[41:31] field again the Kingdom of Heaven is
[41:34] like unto a merchant man seeking goodly
[41:37] pearls who when he had found one pearl
[41:41] of great price he went and sold all that
[41:44] he had and he bought it let's go to the

[43:47] tonight so as
[43:50] we are looking
[43:53] into this year I I I thought I would
[43:57] take amen uh just a a simple thought
[44:01] tonight placing
[44:02] value on your call and your
[44:06] purpose in
[44:09] 2024 and um amen with this being our our
[44:14] first service I I think that it would be
[44:17] a good thing for us
[44:19] to you
[44:20] know examine our lives this evening and
[44:25] and
[44:26] look very closely and see what is
[44:30] important to us this year what is what
[44:34] is more important and then what is most
[44:39] important amen what what is you we all
[44:42] have desires We All We Are all uh we're
[44:46] human beings we're born with
[44:48] desire man we have we have we're a
[44:52] spirit being amen we have our affections
[44:57] we we have our our
[45:00] emotions amen every everything about us
[45:04] in the Physical Realm is is driven by
[45:08] our spirit in the spiritual
[45:11] real and and I I want us to really look
[45:15] at ourselves this this evening because I
[45:20] believe the greatest the most important
[45:23] thing is to give yourself to your call
[45:27] this
[45:28] year let this be the year that we give
[45:31] ourselves our absolute everything to
[45:35] Jesus Christ let this be the year of
[45:39] total
[45:40] fulfillment where we have given
[45:43] everything that we've got and we don't
[45:45] have anything else in
[45:48] reserves amen I've learned that no man
[45:50] lives to himself and I've been preaching
[45:52] for some time on Ministry and and and
[45:57] and while I am definitely not a teacher
[46:00] a teacher can be profound and and really
[46:03] bring it in and me I I have to hit and
[46:06] and and uh slobber and just go around it
[46:09] over and over until I I think maybe I'm
[46:12] getting my my point home and I sure hope
[46:15] that I that that I don't come across as
[46:18] just preaching the same thing over and
[46:20] over uh because I don't feel like I am
[46:23] preaching the same thing over and over
[46:25] I'm I'm trying to hit in every way that
[46:27] I can to get you to understand that the
[46:30] preacher is not the only one with
[46:33] Ministry that we all have a Ministry we
[46:36] all will be responsible to God we all
[46:40] will no man lives to himself and no man
[46:44] Li uh dies to himself and and so you are
[46:49] here to affect somebody you do affect
[46:52] somebody and then when you die you will
[46:55] give an account for those who you have
[46:58] affected both positively and negatively
[47:01] amen we come to Earth with Divine
[47:05] Purpose amen and so I I see that there
[47:10] are too many that that are so uh uh self
[47:15] indulged there amen everything is about
[47:19] them about their family about their
[47:22] career amen and and there's going to be
[47:26] very few that come to the end of life
[47:30] feeling really feeling
[47:33] fulfilled and there's going to be very
[47:36] few that stand on that day amen when we
[47:40] do stand before God at the award banquet
[47:43] and may there may be some that has a
[47:45] tinge of of of sadness because they did
[47:50] not fulfill everything the way that they
[47:53] should have there's so many that are
[47:55] going through life today that are so
[47:58] unfulfilled they're just unfulfilled and
[48:01] and it's because they've neglected the
[48:04] opportunity to step up to the plate and
[48:08] to fulfill a
[48:09] need they amen they they they live amen
[48:14] they have a family they have a job they
[48:16] might even have a nice car things in the
[48:19] amen money in the bank but amen they
[48:22] they they're unfulfilled they have many
[48:25] things but yet they're still empty on
[48:27] the inside is because God didn't call
[48:30] you and and and and birth you here on
[48:34] this Earth send you here to Earth to
[48:36] drive a new car and to live in a new
[48:38] house that's not your purpose your
[48:41] purpose amen is to feel H uh the need in
[48:47] humanity and to you you you you affect
[48:51] somebody and and you're call and many
[48:54] times we think as as as as ministers
[48:57] well it's behind the pulpit amen well I
[49:00] I want to you know as I have said uh
[49:02] here a few times amen h a man if if if a
[49:06] preacher behind this Pulpit is is only
[49:09] is only good to the church behind the
[49:12] pulpit he's not a preacher he's missed
[49:15] his call that's not who you are amen if
[49:19] if if your heart is not for people and
[49:23] it's not showing in your life in your
[49:26] family and really the only time that
[49:29] anyone knows that you're a preacher is
[49:31] when you're behind a pull pit you
[49:34] probably don't have a
[49:37] call because it is a call of God that
[49:41] loves
[49:43] people amen it loves people it's that
[49:46] call I I look there at at at at at what
[49:49] brother brandham had said and and and I
[49:53] I I've got this uh quote here uh let let
[49:56] me let me see if I can find it I I I I
[49:58] like this because uh it gives us a
[50:01] little bit of an idea as he speaks these
[50:04] things about himself and his
[50:06] relationship to the people and and he
[50:09] says I say this that I believe that the
[50:11] that this great spirit that is Among Us
[50:13] is the holy spirit I believe he's called
[50:15] me for this purpose doesn't make me any
[50:18] more than the man that got saved this
[50:20] morning I'm just your your servant your
[50:22] brother makes me less than you because
[50:24] I'm sent to serve you I am a servant to
[50:28] the public a public servant is a
[50:30] minister to serve the public to be the
[50:33] underdog to take the knocks and drives
[50:36] of the public and whatever it is to
[50:38] stand there and if you want if you
[50:41] haven't got Grace enough to smile and
[50:43] take it then you ought to go back to
[50:45] Calvary and reconfirm your commission
[50:47] that's what you're supposed to do then
[50:49] another place he says the gift is not
[50:51] for me I cannot use it for myself it's
[50:55] for you you you're the one that gets the
[50:56] benefit not me I'm just the public
[50:59] servant of God to you a preacher is is a
[51:03] public servant he just holds himself
[51:05] there like a lily of the field the
[51:07] Bumblebee flies in and gets his part and
[51:10] the honeybee flies in and gets his and
[51:13] the passenger the the the bypasser gets
[51:16] his and everything and he toils day and
[51:18] night to keep his Radiance and the
[51:21] gospel Minister does the same thing he
[51:23] walks in line with god holds his test
[51:25] testimony true that the world might
[51:27] partake of him see Mr Pastor Lily he's a
[51:31] good one Jesus said consider him Solomon
[51:34] is not like him and that's that's right
[51:36] Dr Lily I guess you all know him see uh
[51:39] consider the lies how they toil and I I
[51:42] say yet Solomon in all of his glory and
[51:45] Lily has to struggle day and night to
[51:47] get the radiance to keep his garments to
[51:49] keep the perfume and that things are
[51:51] going and others just open and he just
[51:55] open opens himself up and he comes by
[51:58] and they take it out of him the bee and
[52:00] the Fly and everything comes by good or
[52:03] bad just just takes it from him and
[52:06] that's the way the servant is of Christ
[52:09] the Christian servant just opens himself
[52:11] up and says just take from me world
[52:14] nothing for himself it's for others and
[52:17] that's what Christ becomes when he
[52:20] become when he become uh uh kin folk to
[52:23] us he become man that the world might
[52:26] partake of his righteousness see he and
[52:29] and and to be made sons of God can you
[52:32] say man another place brother brandham
[52:35] would say I I just got in here just in
[52:39] time to get to hear that I I miss all
[52:41] the good singing in these meetings
[52:43] because I thought maybe that I well I
[52:46] just I'm so busy you know how it is
[52:50] people come in by plane and by train and
[52:53] they you you you never know it you see
[52:55] they because it it just comes in by the
[52:57] phone and you you have to go to them and
[53:00] meet them and pray for them everywhere
[53:02] it's just constantly going and and then
[53:05] try to study too it it makes it quite a
[53:08] problem but we're always happy to meet
[53:10] the people and do what we can for them
[53:13] because we're a public servant for the
[53:16] Lord Jesus Christ to his people in this
[53:18] day we like to do more than we do but we
[53:23] can't I I I look there in
[53:26] 2024 I I I'm not a prophet and so I I
[53:30] can't I I I'm I I can't even put myself
[53:35] close to what brother brandham was here
[53:38] in these in these incredible statements
[53:42] and how that he looked at himself but
[53:44] for the gift that God gave
[53:47] me with the
[53:49] call that God gave me I am a public
[53:54] servant and and and I'm not just I I
[53:57] can't just place that on William
[53:59] brandham the prophet and I can't just
[54:01] place that on wendle Martin a pastor I
[54:05] cannot just place that on Amen William
[54:08] Smith an evangelist I cannot just place
[54:11] that on Duren Martin a a minister of the
[54:15] Gospel I say tonight that we are all
[54:18] called of God to fulfill a purpose we're
[54:23] all called of God and we will have to
[54:26] answer someday as we as we look there in
[54:30] Matthew 25 the 14th chapter as we go or
[54:33] the 25th chapter in the 14th verse down
[54:36] to the 30th and and and and Jesus says
[54:39] uh you know you you the Kingdom of
[54:42] Heaven is is is as a man traveling into
[54:46] a far country who called his own
[54:48] servants and gathered unto him his goods
[54:51] and and he gave one five talents and to
[54:53] another two and to another one and
[54:56] everyone according to his several
[54:58] ability straight way and straightway
[55:00] took his journey so so now we we can see
[55:03] that there's going to be some that's got
[55:05] that that's been given a lot there's
[55:07] going to be some that's amen given the
[55:09] five there's some that's given the two
[55:10] and then there's one that's just given
[55:11] the one and and and then he leaves and
[55:16] and then he's going to return and it
[55:19] will be the the the it'll be a a joyous
[55:23] time or it'll be a time time of uh it'll
[55:27] be a time of weeping and and and
[55:29] mourning amen are y'all understanding me
[55:32] so so we we we want you to understand
[55:36] and we can and we can see as we went on
[55:38] that that the one with Thea with the
[55:41] five talents he traded amen took his
[55:44] took his uh uh uh talents and he used
[55:47] them prospered them and when the Lord
[55:50] came he gave him 10 more Amen in other
[55:54] words he took what the master gave him
[55:59] and he worked with them and he brought
[56:02] increase to his master amen the other
[56:05] one came in with the two and he he went
[56:08] out used the gifts the talents that God
[56:12] gave him even though they were only two
[56:15] and he multiplied them and had five to
[56:19] give to show his master five extra amen
[56:22] it was he was coming back and he was
[56:24] showing them what you gave me I used
[56:28] them I brought glory to you I am laying
[56:33] amen I am laying the increase down at
[56:36] your feet but then we had the one and
[56:40] the the the one looked at the guy with
[56:43] the five looked at the guy with the two
[56:46] and he said uh man apparently I must not
[56:50] be much I must he must not think of me
[56:54] very much the other one why why he's
[56:58] been given five talents he can play amen
[57:02] the the the the piano and and the
[57:04] trombone and he can and and and and he
[57:07] can preach and and he's got so many so
[57:11] many wonderful gifts and amen and I look
[57:14] at this other one and he's he's a
[57:16] wonderful song leader and he's uh and
[57:19] and he's he's given these talents and
[57:22] and me I don't have much that I can
[57:25] I can give and God just didn't give me
[57:29] much and so he they he takes the one
[57:33] talent and he hides it in the
[57:36] ground amen he hides it in the dirt and
[57:39] then when he hide hallelujah how many
[57:41] knows that you are an earn vessel and
[57:44] the scripture says that the the amen we
[57:47] have Treasures in these earn vessels and
[57:52] we've got to bring these qualities these
[57:56] gifts and we've got to use them well can
[57:58] you say Amen now the one with the with
[58:01] the one with just the single Talent can
[58:03] look at the one with a five and say but
[58:05] I want to do that and I want to do that
[58:07] and I want to do that or he could say
[58:10] I'm here with a purpose and the master
[58:13] has given me something of Great Value
[58:17] and I want to use that value amen for
[58:21] someone uh uh for that specific purpose
[58:24] can you say amen amen now we find that
[58:27] as the as the as the husbandman came
[58:31] back the the master came back and we and
[58:34] we we find that that that he in in the
[58:37] 21st verse he says well done thou good
[58:41] and faithful servant thou has been
[58:43] Faithful over a few things I will make
[58:46] thee ruler over many things enter thou
[58:48] into the joy of the
[58:49] Lord he also uh that received two uh
[58:53] talents came and said Lord thou gave me
[58:55] two and I gained two other besides them
[58:59] and his lord said well done good and
[59:00] faithful servant thou H has been
[59:02] Faithful over a few things I will make
[59:03] thee ruler over many things enter into
[59:06] the joy of the Lord and then he come to
[59:08] the one that received one talent and
[59:11] said Lord I knew that thou art a hard
[59:14] man reaping where thou Hast not sown and
[59:17] Gathering where thou Hast not straw and
[59:20] I was afraid and went and hid thy talent
[59:22] in the earth and lo thou Hast that is
[59:26] thine and he gives it to him and his
[59:29] Lord answered and said unto him thou
[59:31] Wicked and slothful servant thou knowest
[59:34] that I reap where I sow not and gather
[59:36] where I have not straw thou oughtest
[59:39] therefore to have put thy money to the
[59:42] exchangers and then at my coming I
[59:45] should have received mine own Usery take
[59:48] therefore the talent from him give unto
[59:50] him that has 10 For unto everyone that
[59:53] has shall be given and and he that shall
[59:55] and he shall have an abundance but from
[59:58] him that hath not shall be taken away
[1:00:00] even that which he hath and and cast ye
[1:00:03] the unprofitable servant into uh outer
[1:00:06] darkness and there shall be weeping and
[1:00:08] nashing of teeth so when we when we look
[1:00:12] at our
[1:00:13] lives we have purpose as I have as I
[1:00:18] have talked on the on the ministry of
[1:00:20] love as I have beg to talk all Ministry
[1:00:23] stems from love it's a love between a
[1:00:27] relationship between you and God it's a
[1:00:29] relationship that you love him more than
[1:00:31] you love you love anything else and as
[1:00:35] you love him and you realize that you
[1:00:38] were saved for a specific time and a
[1:00:42] specific purpose you understand amen
[1:00:46] that God thought something very special
[1:00:50] of you for you to be here amen and God
[1:00:53] gave you you talents and gifts and those
[1:00:57] gifts and callings are without
[1:00:59] repentance now if you're not called to
[1:01:03] be an evangelist amen maybe you're
[1:01:06] called to be uh H you know maybe you're
[1:01:09] called to be a singer or uh uh maybe
[1:01:13] maybe you're called to to there you know
[1:01:16] many different things there's not
[1:01:18] there's not a set thing maybe amen you
[1:01:22] the Lord has just given you a love for a
[1:01:25] a certain thing and and and and and you
[1:01:29] you are you are giving of that Talent
[1:01:32] back to the Lord amen you see Satan will
[1:01:37] come in and he will try his best to shut
[1:01:41] you up he'll try this his best in
[1:01:45] 2024 to shut up your ministry he'll He
[1:01:48] he'll do everything he can to get you
[1:01:51] distracted and again now I I I want to
[1:01:55] say if if if if you're driving man as as
[1:02:00] as they used to be when I was a kid if
[1:02:01] you're driving a Volkswagen amen don't
[1:02:04] pull up next to a Porsche and expect to
[1:02:06] win the race you can pray all you want
[1:02:08] to but but you're you're in a Volkswagen
[1:02:11] and if God's given you a gift Amen to to
[1:02:16] in a certain area then don't get outside
[1:02:19] that area and push and push and push and
[1:02:21] try to make something happen because
[1:02:23] there's just nothing you can do to make
[1:02:26] that to work that's right if God's not
[1:02:29] called you to do it then I would suggest
[1:02:31] you not do it stay in the gifts and the
[1:02:34] calls amen and just love God and I'm
[1:02:38] telling you if you love God and you love
[1:02:40] people your ministry will Thrive and God
[1:02:42] will automatically place you where you
[1:02:45] are needed because you're not trying to
[1:02:47] put a square peg in a round hole you are
[1:02:51] just loving God you're loving people and
[1:02:56] your gift automatically makes room for
[1:03:00] you that's just the way the prophet
[1:03:02] taught us that it works amen but you see
[1:03:05] what we're needing to do is to find the
[1:03:10] value in the one
[1:03:13] Talent many times we're looking at the
[1:03:15] one talent and saying I don't have much
[1:03:18] but you see it was valuable to him and
[1:03:21] it was valuable in his heart to give it
[1:03:24] to
[1:03:24] you Hallelujah now I I I I think that
[1:03:29] it's this is very very important because
[1:03:32] especially since we know that the time
[1:03:35] is coming when we're going to have to
[1:03:37] give an account to the Lord Jesus for
[1:03:40] these gifts that he has placed in his
[1:03:42] life what can you say amen amen now in
[1:03:45] order to find Value in something then
[1:03:48] you must find an expert who specializes
[1:03:51] in in that particular field amen man
[1:03:54] somebody that has concentrated uh on and
[1:03:57] and and confines himself to a specific
[1:04:00] subject he knows what he's talking about
[1:04:03] he knows the real from the fake he knows
[1:04:06] he understands the the true value of
[1:04:09] something amen and I feel like the Holy
[1:04:12] Spirit here is is the one who knows the
[1:04:14] real true value of the gift that God has
[1:04:18] placed in your life now let me say this
[1:04:21] again amen as I've said so often l
[1:04:25] there is not one person in this building
[1:04:28] that does not have a gift and a call
[1:04:33] there is no one in this building amen
[1:04:36] you have been called of God placed here
[1:04:40] on this Earth with a specific call amen
[1:04:44] hallelujah amen and it's your love I as
[1:04:48] I think about the love for people now I
[1:04:51] I I think of my my my sister uh Denise
[1:04:56] back there now she says that her call
[1:04:57] and she reminds me this
[1:04:59] weekly that her specific call in life am
[1:05:03] man is to Pastor the pastor and now I've
[1:05:09] I've looked in the Bible and I've looked
[1:05:11] through that the quotes and I have not
[1:05:12] found I have not found any Scripture or
[1:05:15] quotes to to uh support that but I will
[1:05:20] say this one thing here H uh uh my my my
[1:05:24] sister and I'm just picking on you going
[1:05:25] to embarrass you here but my sister has
[1:05:27] a love and she's just always been one
[1:05:31] that wants to love and to help and and
[1:05:34] and and where she could help in with our
[1:05:36] kids with the little signers or she's
[1:05:39] tried to help here and tried to help
[1:05:41] there now now there's not a specific
[1:05:44] scripture I in the Bible uh that that
[1:05:48] that talks about little signers and
[1:05:50] little kids but I do know that there has
[1:05:53] been a specific need that has been
[1:05:57] filled by someone that just that is just
[1:06:02] loving that's
[1:06:05] right and and and I will say that that
[1:06:10] gift is is a little bit you I can find
[1:06:12] that a little bit more in the scripture
[1:06:14] than the one that you say that you have
[1:06:17] uh for pastoring the pastor cuz she
[1:06:18] doesn't she's not a peser amen I
[1:06:20] appreciate sister Denise but you see man
[1:06:24] it's it's those it's those it's those
[1:06:27] little things that that that people give
[1:06:31] of themselves that really might not even
[1:06:34] be part of the five-fold ministry might
[1:06:37] not be a part of the gifts and the
[1:06:38] governments in the church the helps in
[1:06:40] the governments but yet they they they
[1:06:44] are gifts that God sends to a particular
[1:06:48] uh to a
[1:06:50] particular
[1:06:52] congregation and and it it causes that
[1:06:56] congregation to thrive it causes that
[1:06:59] congregation to grow and to be fulfilled
[1:07:03] and God baptized that's the reason the
[1:07:05] scripture says amen that he places you
[1:07:09] baptizes you places you into the as a
[1:07:13] member into his body as it pleases him
[1:07:17] he gives the gifts he gives the cause
[1:07:20] these are predestinated by God then he
[1:07:22] saves you amen he he through
[1:07:25] predestination brings you to a
[1:07:27] particular spot and there he causes you
[1:07:31] to thrive and to grow amen and you are
[1:07:35] just like little little uh uh uh
[1:07:37] Reverend Lily amen you don't really no
[1:07:42] one's giv you a title no one's telling
[1:07:45] you that you're something special you're
[1:07:47] just you're just a Lily and you're doing
[1:07:50] what you know to do and the fragrance
[1:07:54] that God gave you you're just you're
[1:07:57] just basking in the presence of God and
[1:08:00] before you know it you're you're you're
[1:08:02] you're you're you're you're blessing the
[1:08:04] bumblebees and you're blessing the birds
[1:08:06] and you're blessing everyone that looks
[1:08:09] upon you the fragrance that you have is
[1:08:13] a Ministry to the
[1:08:17] people man I think the Holy Spirit he
[1:08:21] would know who the expert he as as the
[1:08:26] expert he's the one that knows what he's
[1:08:28] doing when he places you in your gift in
[1:08:31] your call now you you have to have amen
[1:08:35] any experts got to have a standard and
[1:08:37] and a standard is something that
[1:08:40] something that is set or established by
[1:08:42] Authority as a rule it a standard is
[1:08:45] determined amen is used to determine or
[1:08:47] to measure the quality the weight the
[1:08:50] value the uh the quantity and and and
[1:08:53] and the there's always a set standard
[1:08:56] amen uh uh uh you know to to to uh
[1:09:02] measure uh uh the level of quality there
[1:09:05] there is a set standard uh that the
[1:09:08] electricians use and that set standard
[1:09:11] is Nationwide amen it is a standard that
[1:09:15] we judge ourselves by amen our our
[1:09:18] currency or our uh uh the USA amen
[1:09:22] economy is on the go standard that's why
[1:09:25] we measure everything by for its money
[1:09:29] system not all jewelry is created equal
[1:09:32] amen so so you have to have someone who
[1:09:36] who knows how to Value something so that
[1:09:39] you know that whether it's fake or
[1:09:40] whether it's not fake and and and God
[1:09:43] will let us know Hey listen your
[1:09:45] ministry is is is is is not this this
[1:09:49] here is your ministry this is the value
[1:09:51] you're looking at it at at the wrong way
[1:09:54] and I'm thankful for that amen our
[1:09:58] society has a standard amen our
[1:10:02] society has a has a has a has a you know
[1:10:05] a way of determining value it seems like
[1:10:08] the more you have the more valuable you
[1:10:11] are okay amen the bigger the house the
[1:10:15] more valuable you are the prettier you
[1:10:19] have amen the more boyfriends you have
[1:10:23] and the uglier you are
[1:10:26] the less
[1:10:29] boyfriends you in our society a 4,000
[1:10:35] squ foot house on 500 Acres with a three
[1:10:40] car garage amen and a and a one
[1:10:44] time uh uh uh crew cab Ford setting in
[1:10:49] the
[1:10:50] driveway if that's a successful that's a
[1:10:53] successful
[1:10:55] man and then you look at someone that's
[1:10:57] renting a
[1:10:59] 740 squ foot house and with only one
[1:11:04] bath and driving a Rattle Trap of a car
[1:11:07] making minimum wage that's not valuable
[1:11:11] you see God looks at things totally
[1:11:15] different we look in society the more I
[1:11:20] have the more valuable I am
[1:11:24] I don't think that's the way God
[1:11:27] is you whether whether you have the five
[1:11:30] talents or the one
[1:11:32] Talent it's valuable to God and you've
[1:11:37] got to see the
[1:11:39] value I don't care whether you are a a
[1:11:42] man a Donnie Reagan a Tim PR an an ed
[1:11:46] bcll hor a window Martin God gives
[1:11:50] valuable amen God gives value to the one
[1:11:54] that he
[1:11:56] calls he called you that's
[1:12:00] valuable he called me that's valuable so
[1:12:04] what we've got to do is say Lord let me
[1:12:08] see the value in the gift that you've
[1:12:12] given
[1:12:13] me well praise the Lord now some people
[1:12:16] say well if I oh if I could just be
[1:12:20] evangelize like Andrew Glover oh if I
[1:12:23] could just be be like that and just go
[1:12:25] travel oh I would be fulfilled not if
[1:12:28] you weren't called to that that's right
[1:12:30] you can't be
[1:12:32] fulfilled right you would be you it's
[1:12:35] not your call right oh well if I could
[1:12:39] just be a pastor if I could just Pastor
[1:12:43] I I I I would be fulfilled not if you're
[1:12:45] not called to
[1:12:48] that oh if I could be a song leader I
[1:12:51] could show brother Merl a few a few ways
[1:12:54] of leading songs not if you're not
[1:12:57] called to
[1:12:58] that but the call the value is the call
[1:13:04] that God placed upon
[1:13:06] you oh Hallelujah I remember when I was

[1:19:29] singer and and we had to help her stay
[1:19:32] on tune when she sung and and and and we
[1:19:36] all loved her singing and why did we
[1:19:38] love her
[1:19:39] singing it was just so raw and real and
[1:19:44] it would bring the presence of the Lord
[1:19:45] down just not because she could she
[1:19:48] could she could do it and stay I it was
[1:19:50] just right but what did she do she took
[1:19:55] you girls you teenage girls and there
[1:19:58] was so many of you and she nurtured
[1:20:01] you and you all stayed with her at her
[1:20:04] house and she wrote you guys she was
[1:20:07] writing books for y'all man I mean she
[1:20:09] was she she would write y'all letters
[1:20:12] she was constantly nurturing and and
[1:20:15] when I just asked without giving you
[1:20:17] anything and just asking who what woman
[1:20:21] was the most influence qual of your life
[1:20:24] in when your teenage years it wasn't
[1:20:27] even your
[1:20:28] mother even though mother's
[1:20:31] good it was someone in the church yes
[1:20:35] because we need something Beyond them my
[1:20:37] mother and father were very nurturing to
[1:20:39] me and I'm not saying anyone could take
[1:20:40] their place but in that time where I
[1:20:44] couldn't just really come and talk to
[1:20:45] Dad and I felt like aen Mama couldn't
[1:20:48] hear me quite it was somebody that was
[1:20:51] saying I love you God loves you God's
[1:20:54] going to see you right that's
[1:20:57] right it was a
[1:21:00] gift yes and you can't really find it in
[1:21:04] here but it come when you were baptized
[1:21:07] with the Holy Spirit that's right you
[1:21:10] see if if we're not careful we don't
[1:21:14] place value on those things and when we
[1:21:16] don't place value then we don't spend
[1:21:19] the time in prayer we don't spend the
[1:21:21] time before the Lord because Reverend Mr
[1:21:25] Lily has got to have something to offer
[1:21:28] has got to have something to give and
[1:21:31] the gift in itself can't do it there's
[1:21:34] got to be the life of the holy spirit
[1:21:37] that is pushing those gifts out of
[1:21:40] us and Mr Lily can very well amen it's
[1:21:44] so fragile and
[1:21:46] frail that it would be easy to put a
[1:21:48] rock over the top of it and the Lily is
[1:21:51] no longer giving of it self the ministry
[1:21:54] is no longer there and Satan wants to
[1:21:57] come in and to take the fragrance of the
[1:22:00] Little Lily and he want to do anything
[1:22:03] he can Amen to put put it over the top
[1:22:07] in
[1:22:11] 20124 and before you know it your little
[1:22:13] gift is hid inside your little Earth and
[1:22:15] vessel and it's not expressing it the
[1:22:17] way it should and we will have to give
[1:22:19] an account to God that's right

[1:43:22] Hallelujah can you say Amen now don't
[1:43:25] throw it
[1:43:26] away
[1:43:28] man I heard a
[1:43:31] statement and and you know this this I
[1:43:35] wrote it down I heard this statement
[1:43:37] that that said something like don't
[1:43:40] cross oceans for people who wouldn't
[1:43:42] cross a puddle for you that's true no
[1:43:46] that's not true I don't want you to say
[1:43:48] that's
[1:43:49] true
[1:43:52] don't cross oceans for people who would
[1:43:55] not cross a puddle for
[1:43:58] you well I know I know I know I know
[1:44:01] you're you're still in the you're still
[1:44:02] in the gear of just chopping everybody
[1:44:04] else off that's that's that's going to
[1:44:06] affect your ministry
[1:44:08] but what I am not saying that we are
[1:44:12] that we are pushing everyone else
[1:44:15] off I'm saying my call is to give and
[1:44:21] give and give and if I've got someone
[1:44:24] close to me that just just just a just a
[1:44:29] craw Daddy all the time all the time
[1:44:31] backing up no one you can't depend on
[1:44:33] that one to be of a helper you can't
[1:44:35] depend on that one to be of any kind of
[1:44:36] a support you can't depend in your life
[1:44:38] then brother that's the time to push
[1:44:41] that one off and say I'll gladly pray
[1:44:43] I'll glad I'll do whatever I can but I'm
[1:44:46] needing I'm needing some Warriors that's
[1:44:48] going to walk with me amen
[1:44:51] that's got the same kind of attitude I
[1:44:53] have the same kind of
[1:44:55] call there's the difference see there's
[1:44:59] there's what I'm trying to say so now
[1:45:02] the reason I've got to surround myself
[1:45:06] with the
[1:45:07] Positive is
[1:45:09] because that right there is
[1:45:14] wrong you do cross oceans for people yes
[1:45:18] you love people
[1:45:21] you love all people you
[1:45:26] give and continue to give there's no
[1:45:31] conditions
[1:45:33] attached I I I'm talking about the good
[1:45:36] one I'm talking about the good one there
[1:45:38] here's the difference between the good
[1:45:39] and the bad the bad is selfish the good
[1:45:41] one is to get the bad says the Bad Apple
[1:45:45] says don't cross the oceans for people
[1:45:48] who wouldn't cross a puddle for you but
[1:45:50] the The Good Life of Christ says do
[1:45:55] cross the oceans for people do love
[1:45:59] people do love all people no conditions
[1:46:03] attached no wondering whether they're
[1:46:05] worthy of it or not cross those oceans
[1:46:08] climb those mountains give of yourself
[1:46:13] that's what you're here
[1:46:19] for
[1:46:23] we can't look well they're not
[1:46:26] predestinated really come
[1:46:31] on do you have this thing all figured
[1:46:35] out because brother Joe I would have
[1:46:37] given up on you a few
[1:46:39] times
[1:46:41] right but God sees value in
