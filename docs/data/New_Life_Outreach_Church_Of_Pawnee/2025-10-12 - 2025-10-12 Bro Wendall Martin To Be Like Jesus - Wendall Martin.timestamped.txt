[29:45] without some pain. How would we ever
[29:50] know
[29:51] that our tears break your heart?

[30:42] than I did before.
[30:45] Cuz when I needed you,
[30:49] you were there to hold me through. I

[36:55] [Music]
[36:57] Praise the Lord.
[36:59] Amen. I'm so thankful that he has called
[37:03] us into one body by Jesus Christ.
[37:07] And um Amen. and that we are one in him
[37:12] and one with one another. And what a
[37:15] what a wonderful blessing it is to be
[37:18] here with the bride of Jesus Christ here
[37:20] this morning. And um I know that if
[37:24] you've come expecting to receive from
[37:26] the Lord that there is something here to
[37:28] receive from him. Amen. So, we are we're
[37:34] just so uh delighted to see everyone
[37:36] that is here and um uh so good to see
[37:41] brother Brandon and and uh Sister Katie
[37:44] with us here this morning and
[37:49] we uh uh got got to eat some breakfast
[37:52] with them yesterday. And so we counted
[37:54] that a real privilege uh to be able to
[37:56] meet Katie and and to fellowship a
[37:59] little bit there. And so, uh, we just
[38:02] say God bless you. And, uh, Brother
[38:04] Nick, where's Brother Nick at? Amen.
[38:07] Brother Nick right there. Amen. Brother,
[38:09] good to see brother Nick and sister
[38:11] Phoebe and and the family
[38:14] w with us here this morning.
[38:18] Now, uh, Brother Nick is going to be
[38:21] ministering tonight. And so, uh, we are
[38:24] really looking forward to it. I figured
[38:26] we'd just have us a little lesson this
[38:28] morning and then um then we'll have the
[38:31] preacher to come and preach to us this
[38:32] evening. And uh so he he comes highly
[38:36] recommended. Amen. And uh so we we
[38:40] appreciate them. Good to see everyone
[38:41] here here this morning in the presence
[38:44] of the Lord. Let's look here at at 1
[38:45] Corinthians the 3 chapter. And um we're
[38:50] going to start here at the first verse.
[38:53] And um I don't have um I have very
[38:56] little monitors.
[38:59] Um you know what? I I I bet the organs
[39:02] on and the um I used these for the organ
[39:05] the other night. Praise the Lord.
[39:11] Um
[39:12] so we will look here at 1 Corinthians 3
[39:18] and 1.
[39:21] And I, brethren, could not speak unto
[39:23] you as unto spiritual,
[39:26] but as unto carnal,
[39:28] as unto babes in Christ. Yes, thank you,
[39:31] brother. I have fed you with milk, and
[39:34] not with meat. For hither to you ye were
[39:37] not able to bear it. Neither yet are ye
[39:40] now are ye able. Ye ye are yet carnal.
[39:45] For whereas there is among you envying
[39:48] and strife and divisions, and are ye not
[39:51] carnal, and walk as men,
[39:54] for while one saith, I'm of Paul, and
[39:57] another, I'm of Apollos, are ye not
[39:59] carnal? Who then is Paul? And who is
[40:02] Apollos?
[40:03] But ministers by whom you receive, ye
[40:06] believed uh even as the Lord gave to
[40:09] every man. I have planted, Apollos
[40:12] watered, but God gave the increase. So
[40:16] then, neither is he that plantth
[40:18] anything, neither is he that waterth,
[40:21] but God that gives the increase. For he
[40:25] that planth, and he that waterth are
[40:27] one. Every man shall receive of his own
[40:30] reward according to his own labor. For
[40:33] we are labors together with God. And ye
[40:35] are God's husbandry. You're God's
[40:38] building according to the grace of God
[40:40] which is given unto me as a wise master
[40:43] builder. I have laid the foundation and
[40:45] another buildeth thereon.
[40:48] Let every man take heed how he buildth
[40:50] there upon. For other foundation can no
[40:53] man lay and that is laid which is Christ
[40:56] Jesus. Now if any man build upon this
[40:59] foundation, gold, silver, precious
[41:02] stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's
[41:05] work shall be made manifest, for the day
[41:08] shall declare it, because it shall be
[41:10] revealed by fire, and the fire shall try
[41:13] every man's work of what sort it is. If
[41:16] any man's work abide, which he has built
[41:18] upon, thereupon, he shall receive a
[41:22] reward. If any man's work be burned, he
[41:26] shall suffer loss, but he himself
[41:29] shall be saved so as by fire. And then I
[41:34] also want to look at another scripture
[41:36] here in the in the book of um 1 John 2
[41:42] and6
[41:44] and then we'll let you have your seats.
[41:48] It says, "He that saith, he abideth in
[41:51] him ought himself also to walk even as
[41:56] he walked." And I want to minister for
[42:00] just a few moments this morning to be
[42:02] like Jesus.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that your Holy
[42:06] Spirit would be with us, Lord, as
[42:09] continue to be with us as we minister
[42:12] your word. And father, we just want to
[42:14] thank you for the the beautiful uh
[42:17] songs, Lord, the special this morning.
[42:19] We we uh just so enjoyed that. Thank
[42:24] you, Lord, for giving us health and
[42:26] allowing us to be able to come to the
[42:29] house of worship. And we just ask, Lord,
[42:32] now that you would anoint me, Lord, and
[42:35] give the strength that is needed. And we
[42:37] just ask Lord that you would be with
[42:39] your people and that your presence would
[42:42] be with us in a real special way. In
[42:45] Jesus name we pray. Can the church say
[42:47] amen?
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be
[42:51] seated.
[42:54] Amen. We um I brother Merl had mentioned
[42:57] I had I fell off the ladder and um
[43:01] ladder slipped out from underneath me
[43:03] and um and so um I I am a little bruised
[43:09] up here this morning. Uh bruised ego and
[43:12] uh u a bruised uh tailbone and u and my
[43:17] wife says I've got the bruises to prove
[43:19] that. Amen. And so
[43:22] uh uh so we uh uh but thank the Lord
[43:26] we're we're able to stand here this
[43:28] morning and uh give witness of the hope
[43:31] that lies within us. Praise the Lord.
[43:33] Um, I I'm I'm not going to be doing too
[43:37] many acrobats or anything here this
[43:39] morning, but I do have I do have a a
[43:41] thought that I wanted to um minister on
[43:45] here this morning and and growing uh to
[43:50] be like Jesus and growing in the Lord.
[43:54] And I think I think all of us desire to
[43:57] be like Jesus.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's it's part of the seed of
[44:02] God. you I I don't believe I don't
[44:05] believe the serpent's children has a
[44:07] desire to be like Jesus. I I don't
[44:10] believe that. Now they love to worship.
[44:13] The serpent's children do love to
[44:15] worship. Uh Satan Lucifer was the angel
[44:20] of worship. So he knows how to worship.
[44:23] He is the angel of light. But desire and
[44:28] the the desire can only come from the
[44:31] seed.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The seed of God has the desire to
[44:38] be like God.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I and I I think you cannot a
[44:42] preacher cannot give you desire. Mas,
[44:44] daddies, Sunday school teachers, no one
[44:47] can give you desire. Either the seed is
[44:50] there and the desire is in your heart to
[44:54] be like Jesus or it's not. Amen. So, so
[44:58] as we begin to talk here this morning,
[45:01] only those who have Amen. who have the
[45:06] eternal life within them desires to come
[45:09] into maturity.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; There is no Amen. You put a you put an
[45:14] apple tree a plant a seed in the ground
[45:17] or or transplant a small apple tree into
[45:20] your yard. Amen. You don't expect the
[45:23] apple tree to just remain a sapling.
[45:25] Amen. Without it bearing any fruit. But
[45:28] the reason you you plant the tree, amen,
[45:32] is because you desire apples.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it is with God. God plants
[45:38] those seeds within us. And brothers, I
[45:41] just want to tell you, you cannot get
[45:43] away from predestination.
[45:46] You'll never get away from the from the
[45:48] the the act that God done before the
[45:51] foundation of the world. Amen. And so
[45:54] God's desire is for maturity. So you're
[45:58] not the only one wanting to be like
[46:00] Christ. It's God's desire for you to
[46:04] come like Christ. Amen. In fact, the
[46:07] scripture says that you were
[46:09] predestinated to be conformed to that
[46:11] image. Amen. So I I want to say the DNA
[46:15] is in you. Amen. The life of God is
[46:18] there. The sunlight, the sen light is
[46:21] here in this hour to bring about the
[46:25] manifestation of God's presence. Amen.
[46:28] In your life. So when we talk about
[46:31] maturity, amen, we are we are saying it
[46:34] is the state or the fact or the period
[46:37] of being matured. It it amen. Maturity
[46:40] means fully developed, adulthood, uh
[46:43] full growth, sense of responsibility,
[46:46] levelheadedness, responsibleness,
[46:49] wisdom, adultness. Amen. And so so God
[46:53] is Amen. The Apostle Paul was telling
[46:56] the the the church there in in uh uh in
[47:00] the Corinthian church, he said, "The
[47:02] time that you should be teachers, Amen.
[47:04] You have someone you have need of
[47:06] someone to teach you all over again. You
[47:08] Amen. You're you're you're saying I'm of
[47:11] Apollos and I'm of Paul and I'm of
[47:13] this." He said, "You're not taking your
[47:16] not taking your walk seriously at all."
[47:18] Amen. He says, "But there is a growth
[47:22] that God is requiring and there is a
[47:25] maturity that can be had." I believe
[47:28] maturity, amen, should be something that
[47:31] we desire. Can you say amen? Amen.
[47:34] Brother Brandham would say God's looking
[47:36] for character, not membership, but
[47:39] character. Eleazar, when he went to to
[47:42] get the bride of Isaac, he sweated it
[47:44] out until he found character. Remember
[47:47] Abraham put him responsible as God puts
[47:50] us responsible. That's right. We
[47:52] ministers hunt my pride. Amen. I He
[47:56] says, "Bless your heart." I ain't
[47:58] looking for members. I'm looking for the
[48:01] pure in heart. Somebody that will
[48:04] believe the word.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And that's what God's looking for here
[48:09] this morning. Uh pure in heart. somebody
[48:12] that is mature enough that can sit down
[48:15] with father and God. Amen. Begin to tell
[48:18] them about his word and his desires for
[48:21] their life and them take it seriously
[48:24] and well, praise the Lord. Amen. The
[48:27] church is not uh uh uh just coming to
[48:29] church, you know, once or twice a week
[48:31] or once or twice a month. Amen. The
[48:34] church is the living word on the inside
[48:37] of you. It's the manifestation of God on
[48:40] the inside of you. God is wanting to
[48:44] manifest himself through us. Well, glory
[48:46] to God. Amen. And then time evangelism,
[48:49] he says, "And when he when Elizer found
[48:52] the character that was in the woman,
[48:55] Rebecca, the beautiful bride of Isaac,
[48:58] he told her about Isaac, and she never
[49:01] questioned one thing. She believed the
[49:04] word of the messenger and she made ready
[49:07] to go. They went and asked the father.
[49:10] Amen. And he said, "Well, just ask the
[49:12] damsel of the age. She's of a h. Ask
[49:14] her. Let it be her decision." And she
[49:16] says, "I will go to what?" A man she had
[49:20] never seen. Know nothing about. But she
[49:23] was ready because she was predestined
[49:26] and forained to that. That's exactly
[49:29] right. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. the
[49:32] growth, the the the desire to go. I want
[49:35] to be like Jesus. We sing that song to
[49:37] be like Jesus. On earth, I long to be
[49:42] like him. Amen. All through life's
[49:44] journey from earth to glory, my desire
[49:47] is to be like him. Now, this message has
[49:50] not come to those out in Babylon. Amen.
[49:54] Babylon is not is is not who God is
[49:56] looking for. It is the bride. There
[49:59] there's going to be those out here in
[50:02] Leosa that Amen. they may go to church
[50:05] and they may uh uh uh sing songs but
[50:09] again that is not the reflection of the
[50:12] bride because true worship can only come
[50:16] by divine revelation. True worship only
[50:20] comes by revelation. Well, praise the
[50:22] Lord.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You look there at the woman at the
[50:27] well when Jesus come. The Bible says
[50:30] that Jes Jesus said, "I I needs be to go
[50:35] to Samaria and he goes and sets down at
[50:39] that well." Amen. And there he is at the
[50:42] sitting at at the well a because he
[50:46] needed to be at that well. Now get now,
[50:48] now get me here this morning because
[50:50] there was an eternal gene seed thought
[50:53] of God that was going to be there at
[50:56] that well. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now,
[50:59] now the woman that come to the well did
[51:01] not look like a saint at all. The woman
[51:04] that came to the well did not even look
[51:05] like a Christian at all. In fact, she is
[51:08] one that probably we wouldn't want in
[51:11] our churches. Amen. She is one that
[51:14] maybe, amen, we wouldn't want our
[51:16] daughters hanging around. Amen. She was
[51:19] living with another man. Amen. She had
[51:22] been married five times. Her life was a
[51:25] wreck. But yet Jesus said, "I must go to
[51:32] Samaria."
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was a seed that was
[51:36] buried in on the inside of that. Oh,
[51:40] glory to God. Amen. You see, sometimes
[51:43] we we look at our families and we say,
[51:45] "Well, amen. We we've got it all put
[51:48] together, but God is not looking, Amen,
[51:51] at at your at your natural pedigree.
[51:54] He's not looking at your status in
[51:57] society. God is looking at your origin.
[52:02] Your origin did not start with your
[52:04] mother and your father. Your origin
[52:08] started, Amen, with God before the
[52:11] foundation of the world.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's the seed that
[52:17] is wanting to come to maturity. That's
[52:19] the seed that God's wanting to make more
[52:21] like him. That's what God has come.
[52:23] Well, praise the name of the Lord.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; I' I've always liked that story because
[52:28] Amen. I I I I remember it was it was
[52:32] Melzdc that came to to Abraham and told
[52:36] him that he was going to be Amen. uh
[52:40] have a natural lineage and that he would
[52:43] have a spiritual lineage and amen he was
[52:46] he was told that that Sarah was going to
[52:49] have a baby and he come to the most
[52:52] unlikely
[52:54] couple in in all the world. Amen. Sarah
[52:57] never was able to have a baby. Amen.
[53:00] They were both old. They they never they
[53:03] didn't have anything going for them.
[53:05] They were idol worshippers. But yet
[53:08] there was a seed on the inside. And it
[53:11] was Melzdc that came to him and brought
[53:15] life to him. Amen. Did you know that the
[53:17] Bible says Jesus come after the order of
[53:21] Melzdc? Brother Brandham said, Amen.
[53:23] that God came from that pillar of fire
[53:27] and then he came on down into the body
[53:29] of Melzdc who had no beginning of days
[53:32] nor ending of days. He was the high
[53:35] priest. He was the king of Salem. And
[53:39] then that man become amen in the body of
[53:43] Jesus Christ. You know it was Melzdc
[53:46] that came to that woman there at the
[53:48] well that morning. Amen. It was Melzdc
[53:51] coming in Amen. and speaking the word of
[53:54] life to her. Amen. Because she was an
[53:58] eternal Jean suck of God. It was a it
[54:01] was something by predestination
[54:04] and it took that high priest to come in
[54:07] and to bring about what God had started
[54:10] in her life.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I like that. He didn't
[54:17] come to those who had it together. No,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; she did not have everything going
[54:24] &gt;&gt; in this world, but she had everything
[54:26] going for her in that other in that
[54:29] other realm.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; God came to her to ignite that seat. Do
[54:34] you realize that you've got a high
[54:36] priest here this morning that is
[54:38] interceding for your perfection?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you want to
[54:42] shout. You've got a high priest this
[54:45] morning that is interceding. Amen. For
[54:48] your maturity. Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[54:52] Oh yes. Amen. The struggles are there.
[54:55] Amen. Because you're living in this body
[54:58] of decay. And this Amen. But this is not
[55:00] who you really are. This is not who you
[55:03] really are. Amen. If you could see,
[55:06] Amen. where you came from and understand
[55:09] the commitment that God has for you. And
[55:12] brother Brandham would say it was that
[55:14] one angel that come to Abraham and his
[55:17] group up there on the mountain and
[55:19] performed a miracle and discerned the
[55:21] thoughts that was in his heart. And
[55:24] Sarah was on the inside where the other
[55:26] angels went into Sodom had thousands
[55:29] down there. Do you see the shaking that
[55:32] comes in the little group? But he's
[55:34] getting the bride ready. That's what it
[55:37] is. That's that we're going to end right
[55:39] here by saying this. The end time
[55:42] message is to get the bride ready and
[55:46] prepare for the rapture.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I I've just been
[55:52] sort of thinking about this. Amen. Here
[55:54] this morning and I just I might just end
[55:56] up just talking to y'all for a moment.
[55:57] Amen. But you realize that that Melzdc
[56:00] has come in our generation. Do you
[56:03] realize that that angel has come? What
[56:06] did he come to do? It's still the great
[56:09] high priest of God that is looking out
[56:12] for God's word. Oh my. It might have
[56:15] been lost in this vessel and lost in sin
[56:18] and lost uh h in in adultery and lost
[56:22] over here, but God knows where you are
[56:25] and God knows how to find you.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, that just makes
[56:31] me want to shout.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; There's a certain quality.
[56:35] There is a certain character
[56:38] to the seed of God that that wants to
[56:42] believe God's word that does not want to
[56:45] just be religious.
[56:48] Now I want you to understand Judas was
[56:51] religious.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He cast out devils, done miracles.
[56:56] Now the Bible says in these last days
[56:59] just as it was in the days of Moses
[57:03] when Janice and James chambers withtood
[57:07] Moses
[57:08] so will it be in the end time.
[57:12] Satan would come in with worship and
[57:16] could really do a lot of things that
[57:19] Moses could do. Moses threw his rod
[57:22] down. They threw their rod down. Moses
[57:25] put his hand in his bosom, brought it
[57:27] back out, it was leprosy. Put it back
[57:29] in, it was whole. So did these other
[57:31] men. Now the the the the prophecy is in
[57:35] the last day, Christianity would be so
[57:38] close that it would deceive the very
[57:40] elect if it was possible.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; But it cannot deceive the very elect.
[57:44] For only the elect can believe the word.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; The elect can only believe the word. And
[57:52] you've got a high priest who is
[57:56] interceding on your behalf.
[58:01] Oh, can you say amen? He's interceding
[58:03] on your behalf. Amen. He's not, oh my,
[58:06] your your mind plays tricks and this
[58:09] plays tricks and that plays tricks, but
[58:11] God knows who you are and God's going to
[58:15] bring that word to pass in your life
[58:18] because God is still God.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:21] That's right.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Now, so if Christ paid the price, he's
[58:28] paid the price for all his sons and
[58:31] daughters. Amen. Christ come to reflect
[58:35] the heart of God.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Because he's got a purpose. He's got a
[58:39] design.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; He wants maturity. He wants sons. He
[58:45] wants daughters. Amen. that is going to
[58:48] reflect his glory in this evil age.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Going to reflect his glory.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; That that that it's an incredible
[58:58] thought because it's not up to you to
[59:02] produce it. It's up to the seed within
[59:05] you that is to produce it. You see, many
[59:09] times we we get this religious attitude.
[59:13] Amen. Whether it's religious thinking
[59:16] that I've got to and then when you fail.
[59:19] Amen. Well, you're not worthy anymore.
[59:22] You never were worthy
[59:24] &gt;&gt; and you never will be worthy.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; You never will be worthy. Amen. So, you
[59:31] got to get that out of your mind. Well,
[59:32] but I messed up. Well, you're going to
[59:34] mess up tomorrow, too. I'm sorry.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. You're going to be messing up
[59:38] every time you turn around. Amen. That's
[59:41] just who you are. But we don't put stock
[59:44] in this flesh.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Aren't you glad
[59:47] for that?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; It ain't whether you're a Gonzalez or
[59:51] whether you're a Wright or whether
[59:52] you're a Amen
[59:55] a Martin or a Torrance or Amen
[59:58] Lancaster. That that Hallelujah. That
[1:00:02] means nothing. Land. Amen. You you can
[1:00:05] you you can have your class and you can
[1:00:07] have all of these things here and that
[1:00:09] might work in religion but it will not
[1:00:11] work for maturing.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Only the seed of God has the permission
[1:00:19] to be like God. Can I hear an amen?
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; It's grace to you. It's grace given to
[1:00:27] you to be like Jesus Christ. And I just
[1:00:30] want to tell you right now, if you're a
[1:00:32] seed of God here this morning and you're
[1:00:34] running from God, amen, and you're
[1:00:36] trying to do your own thing, I just want
[1:00:38] to tell you, God knows who you are and
[1:00:41] he knows how to get your attention.
[1:00:46] Can you say amen? Amen. You might be
[1:00:49] buried. I I you know, we used to have a
[1:00:51] vine. Sister Carol, we remember this.
[1:00:53] Amen. Well, there might there's probably
[1:00:55] several here that can remember that. I
[1:00:57] Amen. We used to have a vine at the at
[1:01:00] at at our old church. And uh uh and and
[1:01:03] the deal was is you know the church is
[1:01:05] an old building and um but it it had got
[1:01:08] a crack uh uh uh there in the middle of
[1:01:11] this of the building there after many
[1:01:14] years of setting and settling. It it had
[1:01:16] a little crack there and and then we had
[1:01:18] a a stone and it's still there a stone
[1:01:21] altar and um and then we've got those
[1:01:24] little windows. And so over here on this
[1:01:26] side, we had a little vine, a little
[1:01:30] sprig come up. Amen. Right next to that
[1:01:33] altar. Hallelujah. Well, sister Carol
[1:01:36] was wanting, you know, and the girls,
[1:01:38] they said, you know, we would I, you
[1:01:40] know, want to cut that off. And I said,
[1:01:42] no, don't cut that off. Don't. Amen. And
[1:01:45] they said, oh, Brother Wendell, it's
[1:01:46] grass. It's a it's a weed. It's this.
[1:01:48] And I said, you know, that that seed has
[1:01:52] been under that concrete.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; It's been under that concrete for 40
[1:01:59] years.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; It's been laying there dormant.
[1:02:04] Hallelujah.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; But then there came a crack in the
[1:02:09] concrete and light from that window has
[1:02:12] been warming up that concrete. Amen. And
[1:02:15] it caused the seed to energize. I said
[1:02:18] there it there is no telling how long
[1:02:21] that little that little vine has been
[1:02:23] working its way up working its way
[1:02:26] through the cracks working its way
[1:02:28] through the Amen this that and the other
[1:02:30] Amen until it is sprouted it and and
[1:02:34] Sister Carol's holding her Amen her head
[1:02:37] her her her hands like this that vine
[1:02:39] grew and it grew and it grew and it grew
[1:02:43] and it grew and they would threaten it.
[1:02:45] We're going to we're going to pluck that
[1:02:46] up. I said, "Don't pluck up my vine."
[1:02:49] Amen. I preached many a sermon on that
[1:02:51] vine. And I want to tell you, there
[1:02:53] might be concrete over your over your
[1:02:56] seed. You might be an utter chaos. It
[1:03:00] might look impossible. But I want to
[1:03:02] tell you, God knows who you are. And
[1:03:06] God's got confidence in his seed. And
[1:03:09] the light is going to bring your seed to
[1:03:12] pass.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; It's going to mature.
[1:03:16] Can you say amen?
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Character.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Character. Being like him.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, it seems like it's so beyond us, but
[1:03:26] it's not. And it is beyond you, but it's
[1:03:29] not beyond who you really are. The seed
[1:03:32] on the inside. I talk about the seed
[1:03:35] over and over and over. Brother Brandham
[1:03:37] would say, you study the character a
[1:03:39] little bit and then look at yourself.
[1:03:41] And I look at myself. That's what he
[1:03:44] was. That's who he was. That's why he
[1:03:46] was to save you. He become you. That you
[1:03:49] might become him. He took your load of
[1:03:52] sin. Therefore, when we come to him, we
[1:03:55] will not have to stand. Amen. We could
[1:03:58] not stand in the presence of God.
[1:03:59] There's no way for us to do it. But when
[1:04:02] we stand in him, he's already recognize
[1:04:05] the sacrifice. This is my beloved son in
[1:04:08] whom I'm well pleased. Amen. I I He
[1:04:11] recognized it. There's no blemish in
[1:04:13] him. Yet he suffered temptation like any
[1:04:16] other man. He was scorned. He was made
[1:04:19] fun of. He was persecuted from the hour
[1:04:22] he was born until the hour he died. Yet
[1:04:25] he returned good for evil. You cannot no
[1:04:28] way ever produce a character like that
[1:04:33] only accepting that character in you.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Church cannot do it. A creed cannot do
[1:04:39] that. Denomination cannot do that.
[1:04:42] Education cannot do that. It must be a
[1:04:44] birth. It's got to be a dying out,
[1:04:47] letting God in it by the grace of God
[1:04:50] molding this type of character in you
[1:04:52] that you become him and your life and
[1:04:54] his is the same. Then you are sons and
[1:04:58] daughters of God. Then you grow in
[1:05:01] grace. Can you say amen?
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Brother Brandon would
[1:05:06] say after Jesus doing this, nobody else
[1:05:08] could do it. We are invited. Somebody
[1:05:11] say, "We are invited."
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Now, church, think of this just a
[1:05:15] minute. We are invited to shape our own
[1:05:19] character to his by his grace. We are
[1:05:24] invited, think of it, to to become
[1:05:27] characters like his if we're ready to to
[1:05:30] to uh uh lay our character down and
[1:05:34] molding that we had heavy, high-minded,
[1:05:37] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:05:39] God, false accusers, incontinent,
[1:05:41] despisers of those that are trying to do
[1:05:43] right, having a form of godliness and
[1:05:45] denying the power of the word. How can
[1:05:48] God come into a place like that when
[1:05:50] they deny the word? when he watches over
[1:05:53] his word to vindicate it. And I just
[1:05:55] want to say again, there's only one
[1:05:57] class that can do believe God's word.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; There's only one class. Well, praise the
[1:06:04] Lord.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; How that should bring us in awe. How
[1:06:08] that should bring us in such a a love
[1:06:10] for him. How when we come into his
[1:06:12] presence, oh brother, there there
[1:06:14] remember only by revelation can you come
[1:06:16] into his presence.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Oh no, no, no. Music doesn't bring you
[1:06:21] into his presence. It helps assist. But
[1:06:23] divine revelation.
[1:06:25] Are are you hearing me? They would say,
[1:06:27] "Amen." They they would they the
[1:06:30] prophets would ask for a minstrel. That
[1:06:32] is true.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; But the minstrel was not the presence of
[1:06:36] God.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; It would prepare them to come into his
[1:06:40] presence and then his Amen. the presence
[1:06:42] of God would come over the and a vision
[1:06:45] would break forth. But you see, it
[1:06:47] wasn't the music that was the presence
[1:06:49] of God. Are are you hearing me? So it is
[1:06:52] today. Amen. You It's the revelation of
[1:06:56] the hour, who you are, what God is
[1:07:00] doing. It's that revelation that brings
[1:07:03] you into his presence. And then and only
[1:07:06] then is there worship.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I started out by saying, "Amen.
[1:07:14] Look, look at look at the all of the all
[1:07:17] of the running around and and and all of
[1:07:20] the the dancing and the and the and to
[1:07:23] to the music and the beats and Leosa
[1:07:25] today. We've got it all over the place
[1:07:27] and mega churches and and we we've got
[1:07:29] all of these kinds of things that that
[1:07:30] is that is going on. Is that true
[1:07:33] worship? You've got to worship according
[1:07:37] to revelation.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Tears is not the worship. Jumping is not
[1:07:43] the worship. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:07:46] Singing songs is not the worship.
[1:07:49] Revelation
[1:07:51] of his presence and acknowledging where
[1:07:54] he is. There is where worship can take
[1:07:59] place.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; So, it's not the feel. You can be in
[1:08:08] your lion's den
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; and worship.
[1:08:12] You can there's the maturity of spirit
[1:08:15] recognizing I don't feel it but you
[1:08:18] never did have to feel it.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; You this this flesh will it it it's all
[1:08:23] by emotions and feelings but God can be
[1:08:26] right there in your presence and you
[1:08:29] don't feel a thing.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It's the divine
[1:08:35] revelation that I will not leave you nor
[1:08:38] forsake you.
[1:08:40] Abraham did not feel tingles going up
[1:08:43] and down his spine. But Abraham had a
[1:08:46] revelation from God that he was going to
[1:08:49] have that child. And in the midst of his
[1:08:52] questions and in the midst of those
[1:08:54] times, amen, where he felt so alone and
[1:08:57] felt 25 years of walking by faith and it
[1:09:01] looked like it would never happen, but
[1:09:03] he could stand there by divine
[1:09:04] revelation knowing that God was going to
[1:09:07] mature that word in him and that he was
[1:09:09] going to have that child.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; He he had the assurance.
[1:09:19] Therefore, worship.
[1:09:21] Amen. He judged God faithful.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; He judged God faithful.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; He judged God. Well, I'm not looking at
[1:09:29] this. I'm not looking at that. I'm
[1:09:31] looking at the promise.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:09:39] And then when the time come for the Now
[1:09:42] it's it's it's pretty amazing because
[1:09:46] Lot did not have that seed to grow.
[1:09:50] So Lot's faith could never just rise
[1:09:52] above it. Lot I mean it rose a little
[1:09:55] bit. Amen. Enough to to get to the Amen.
[1:09:58] the fence of the of the of the chicken
[1:10:00] yard maybe. Amen. But he couldn't he
[1:10:02] just couldn't get out there and fly like
[1:10:03] Abraham. Amen. He did. He left and
[1:10:06] followed He followed Abraham. He
[1:10:09] followed Abraham's promise, but it
[1:10:12] wasn't a revelation to him. So, he just
[1:10:14] went on
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; He went back out in the world. He never
[1:10:16] could leave the world.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; He never could leave Sodom. He had
[1:10:20] nothing in him. Amen. He was just
[1:10:23] satisfied with being a lukewarm church
[1:10:25] member.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And what little bit of faith he had was
[1:10:29] totally paralyzed by the world. But
[1:10:32] Abraham, who had nothing going for him
[1:10:35] but divine revelation, it was God that
[1:10:37] appeared to Abraham and said, "You're
[1:10:39] going to have that child." He couldn't
[1:10:41] explain it, but he was willing to come
[1:10:43] out of the world. He was willing to
[1:10:46] forsake it all and say, "I'm going to
[1:10:49] follow God's word." Brother, I say
[1:10:51] today, Amen, that watch what the the the
[1:10:54] the royal seed of Abraham is doing
[1:10:56] today. Amen. willing to forsake all the
[1:11:00] world to follow Jesus to follow his
[1:11:03] word. It's got to be our desire. It's
[1:11:06] got to be everything to us. Not one foot
[1:11:09] in the world and one foot Amen. serving
[1:11:11] the Lord. That's what Lot done. And Lot
[1:11:14] Amen. He ended up in great disaster. Can
[1:11:17] you say amen? But Abraham was waiting
[1:11:20] upon that promise.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:25] Now, Abraham was invited.
[1:11:28] He was invited by divine
[1:11:32] revelation.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; You are invited by divine revelation. He
[1:11:39] says you're invited to be molded into
[1:11:42] his image that we might reflect his
[1:11:47] presence. And the works that I do shall
[1:11:51] you do also. the life that I live, so
[1:11:56] shall you. We're invited by God to take
[1:11:59] him as an example and let our character
[1:12:02] be molded like this. What a thing he
[1:12:04] says. And then he says, "My hallelujah."
[1:12:08] Then we have to let his character be in
[1:12:10] us. Then we have to become sons by
[1:12:13] having the mind of Christ which is his
[1:12:16] character. Can you say amen?
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. growing. Now
[1:12:25] we So the obstacles
[1:12:28] the obstacles are not is not is not the
[1:12:33] is not the problem.
[1:12:36] Growing
[1:12:38] is already built within us.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's it's it's there. I think I
[1:12:45] think what what Satan has tried to do is
[1:12:48] is he's turned the gospel into a
[1:12:52] humanistic gospel.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; So he's taken the supernatural out of
[1:12:57] the gospel
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; and made it a human
[1:13:01] um made it a human religion.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's all about it's all about
[1:13:08] feeling good. It's all about your
[1:13:10] emotions and music. It's all about th
[1:13:14] those kinds of things. So, it's become a
[1:13:16] humanistic It's become a humanistic
[1:13:18] gospel. God is not looking for a
[1:13:21] humanistic gospel. It is a supernatural
[1:13:24] gospel.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Faith is the only way we're going to
[1:13:27] grow. Faith is the only way we're going
[1:13:29] to overcome.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Now, hallelujah. Anybody can better
[1:13:34] themselves. That's not the kind of
[1:13:35] maturity God's looking for. God's not
[1:13:38] looking for someone to better
[1:13:39] themselves. If that's the case,
[1:13:40] education will do the job. Yes.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; If that Well, that's right. That's
[1:13:45] right. Well, well, they say, "Well,
[1:13:47] education, educa, we we need better
[1:13:48] teachers in the suburbs. We need better
[1:13:50] teachers. We need better education. We
[1:13:52] need better schools. We Amen." Listen,
[1:13:54] that is not what what what these uh
[1:13:58] communities need. What they need is the
[1:14:00] reality of the supernatural presence of
[1:14:04] God
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; to ignite the seed and let it grow.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Now we when we when we look at that
[1:14:16] Amen. The scripture the the scripture
[1:14:19] teaches us he says Amen. Uh uh there in
[1:14:22] in in in second uh Peter 3 and 17 he
[1:14:26] does give us some warnings. He says,
[1:14:28] "Therefore, beloved, seeing ye know
[1:14:30] these things before,
[1:14:33] beware, lest ye also, being led away
[1:14:37] with the error of the wicked, fall from
[1:14:40] your own steadfastness.
[1:14:42] But grow in grace and in the knowledge
[1:14:46] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
[1:14:50] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Now, so when you are when when you are
[1:14:55] putting God on your own human terms,
[1:14:59] then you're limiting and stunting your
[1:15:01] faith.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; But I just I just want to say in order
[1:15:05] for growth, in order for growth, the the
[1:15:10] only way the seed can do anything is
[1:15:13] through divine revelation,
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; faith in God's word.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; That is where we're that's where we
[1:15:26] stand. Now, when you start looking at
[1:15:28] Well, but we believe it this way. But we
[1:15:30] you're stunting your growth right there.
[1:15:32] Amen. You're going to stunt your growth
[1:15:36] and you're going to be removed from your
[1:15:38] own steadfastness.
[1:15:40] But there is a grace. Hallelujah.
[1:15:43] Second Peter 1 and3 it says, "According
[1:15:46] as his divine power," somebody say, "His
[1:15:49] divine power.
[1:15:51] hath given unto us all things.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "All things
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; that pertain unto life and godliness
[1:15:59] through the knowledge or revelation of
[1:16:02] him who hath called us to glory and
[1:16:05] virtue, whereby are given unto us
[1:16:08] exceeding great and precious promises,
[1:16:10] that by these ye might be partakers of
[1:16:12] the divine nature. Besides this, having
[1:16:15] all diligence, add to your faith virtue,
[1:16:18] and to virtue knowledge, and to
[1:16:20] knowledge temperance, and temperance
[1:16:22] patience, to patience godliness, to
[1:16:25] godliness brotherly kindness, to
[1:16:27] brotherly kindness charity. For if these
[1:16:30] things be in you, and abound, they make
[1:16:33] you that you shall never be barren, nor
[1:16:37] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:16:40] Jesus Christ.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Okay? That's right.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; So
[1:16:48] God would not say for us to do these
[1:16:50] things if it wasn't possible. Anything
[1:16:52] that is supernatural, anything that is
[1:16:54] has to do with God, there is nothing a
[1:16:57] man can do to bring it about. Again, if
[1:17:00] God was wanting that, then then he would
[1:17:03] have never had to have come. But he's
[1:17:06] come for a purpose.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; And that is to ignite you,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; energize the seed.
[1:17:12] Let the seed grow. Can you say
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I I've got a few things here that I
[1:17:19] want to
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh to to to bring out just a
[1:17:23] little bit further. I'm not going to
[1:17:23] really I'm not going to hold you too
[1:17:25] long here this morning.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; But we have to have things to overcome.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; We've got to have things to overcome.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just don't believe in this
[1:17:37] gospel that this message that you're
[1:17:40] okay like you are. So all you have to do
[1:17:42] is accept accept this
[1:17:46] this man that you think is Jesus and
[1:17:49] then you can stay in your sin.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; That's not what God wants. You can't
[1:17:55] stay in your sin and claim to be a
[1:17:58] believer.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus came to save you from your sin.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he come and and we
[1:18:09] could actually look at it. It's there in
[1:18:10] in in first uh John the 3 chapter.
[1:18:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:21] I tell you what, I do not recommend
[1:18:23] anybody falling off a ladder
[1:18:26] and uh
[1:18:29] that that is not a good deal. Amen. Now,
[1:18:32] I heard brother Merl saying that this
[1:18:34] morning, but he should have told me
[1:18:35] before.
[1:18:38] Now 1 John 3 and 1, behold what manner
[1:18:41] of love the father hath bestowed upon us
[1:18:46] that we should be called the sons of
[1:18:48] God. Now once again it has nothing to do
[1:18:51] with you.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; What manner of love the father has
[1:18:57] bestowed. You didn't save yourself. You
[1:19:00] didn't ask yourself. I did not ask my
[1:19:02] dad if I could be his son.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] My dad had to have a relationship with
[1:19:10] my mother. There had to be, Amen, a
[1:19:13] literal relationship in order for me to
[1:19:16] come. There's got to be a relationship
[1:19:19] of God with your soul that makes you a
[1:19:24] son of God.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what behold what manner of love
[1:19:32] the father hath bestowed upon me that I
[1:19:35] should be called the sons of God.
[1:19:37] Therefore the world knows us not because
[1:19:39] it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the
[1:19:43] sons of God. It does not yet appear. Now
[1:19:45] he's letting us know. And this is where
[1:19:47] this is where I'm trying to to to bring
[1:19:49] about. Amen. The two you're living in a
[1:19:51] body, but yet there is a seed in you.
[1:19:54] Now we are the sons of God. Right now.
[1:19:57] Right now.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Right. Somebody say, "Right now."
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Right now,
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. Right now, but it
[1:20:05] does not yet appear what we shall be.
[1:20:08] But we know that when he shall appear,
[1:20:10] we shall be like him. For we shall see
[1:20:13] him as he is. And what is he? He is the
[1:20:16] word made flesh.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And every man that has this hope in him
[1:20:22] purifies
[1:20:23] himself even as he is pure. Whosoever
[1:20:27] commits sin transgresseth also the law.
[1:20:30] For the sin is the transgression of the
[1:20:32] law. And ye know that he was manifested
[1:20:35] to take away our sins, and in him is no
[1:20:41] sin.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Whosoever abideth in him sins not.
[1:20:47] Whosoever sinnth hath not seen him,
[1:20:50] neither known him. Little children, let
[1:20:52] no man deceive you. He that do
[1:20:56] righteousness is righteous. He even as
[1:21:00] he is righteous. He that commits sin is
[1:21:02] of the devil. For the devil sinnth from
[1:21:05] the beginning. For this purpose the son
[1:21:09] of God was manifested that he might
[1:21:12] destroy
[1:21:14] the works of the devil.
[1:21:17] Whosoever is born of God does not commit
[1:21:21] sin, for his seed remains in him. He
[1:21:26] cannot sin because he is born of God. In
[1:21:30] this the children of God are manifest,
[1:21:33] and the children of the devil. Whosoever
[1:21:35] doeth not righteousness is not of God,
[1:21:38] neither he that loves not his brother.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; now you're saying, "What,
[1:21:45] man? And one minute I'm a son of God,
[1:21:46] the next minute I'm a son of the devil
[1:21:48] because I know for sure that I do some
[1:21:49] sinning.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] The seed of God on the inside, the seed
[1:21:58] of God has never sinned.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; The seed desires to be like Jesus.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; You were predestinated to be conformed
[1:22:11] to that word image. It's the desire of
[1:22:16] the apple seed to produce oranges.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Got you, brother Mike. It's the desire
[1:22:23] of the apple seed to produce peaches.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; It that is just as stupid as stupid.
[1:22:29] See, he didn't think I was going to be
[1:22:31] stupid.
[1:22:33] It's It's stupid to expect an apple seed
[1:22:37] to produce peaches. It's stupid to
[1:22:40] produce to to to think an apple seeds
[1:22:43] going to produce oranges,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And it's stupid
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; to think you can be a son of God and
[1:22:51] still want to go out there and sin
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; and and and and say that, well, I'm I'm
[1:22:56] going to I'm going to sin. I know. I
[1:22:58] know I shouldn't, but I but I just got
[1:22:59] but you know, this is just the way it
[1:23:01] is. That's not a son of God.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Well, God just has to understand that
[1:23:06] this is just the way it is. In my
[1:23:08] situation, I have to do this. You are
[1:23:11] not a son of God until the seed of God
[1:23:14] on the inside of you has come to life.
[1:23:17] And then maturity can come.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; He's come to destroy the works of the
[1:23:28] devil.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; So now this this this case that we've
[1:23:33] got today that says, "Oh, well, God just
[1:23:35] knows the heart." He does. That's where
[1:23:37] the seed of God is and that's where the
[1:23:39] seed of the devil is. And either you are
[1:23:42] going to love sin and you are going to
[1:23:45] forsake God's word and say, "Well, I
[1:23:47] don't care about that." Amen. Well, then
[1:23:49] hallelujah. You've not been born again
[1:23:51] yet. But if you've been born of that
[1:23:53] eternal seed,
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; if you've been born of that that that
[1:23:57] word seed of God, it is God's permission
[1:24:00] to you. Amen. I you can be like me. I am
[1:24:03] inviting you into my grace. I am
[1:24:07] inviting you, Amen, to share of my
[1:24:10] character. I am divi. Oh, can you say
[1:24:13] amen? It's not taught. You don't teach
[1:24:16] it. You don't learn it. It's not
[1:24:18] education. It's the life of God on the
[1:24:22] inside of you living its life.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Well, glory be to the lamb of God. Amen.
[1:24:31] Why could Jesus, Amen, uh declare the
[1:24:34] glory of God as he done? Is because God
[1:24:37] gave him permission as a son to glorify
[1:24:40] his name.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; So what are we doing? We want to take
[1:24:47] every thought, everything that is
[1:24:50] contrary to that word and say, "I'm
[1:24:53] going to line it up with this right
[1:24:55] here. No matter how big, how small, I
[1:24:59] have been given permission. Well, pray.
[1:25:02] How many remembers when God ignited your
[1:25:04] seat?
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Amen. Don't you remember
[1:25:08] that time when that special something?
[1:25:10] Some of you might have shouted all over
[1:25:12] the place. Some of you might have been
[1:25:13] balling at an altar. Some of you might
[1:25:16] might have been at a at a youth group
[1:25:18] somewhere. Amen. But but something took
[1:25:21] place. Whether you was by yourself or
[1:25:22] with people, something took place. You
[1:25:26] knew there was something that had just
[1:25:28] transpired.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, the prophet would
[1:25:37] tell us
[1:25:39] that there is sin
[1:25:42] singular and there are sins
[1:25:46] plural.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; The serpent's children sin singular.
[1:25:52] Yeah.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; If you're out there in the world and
[1:25:54] you're you're you're when you were it
[1:25:56] was the the the the it was a singular
[1:26:00] sin. You unbelief. And because you
[1:26:02] disbelieve,
[1:26:05] you do the things you've done. When it
[1:26:07] all comes down to it, the seed of
[1:26:09] unbelief.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Okay? That's why you crowds and that's
[1:26:14] why you you you smoke and drink and dope
[1:26:18] and shack up and do all these kinds of
[1:26:20] things is because Amen. We were born
[1:26:23] sinners. That's the nature. That's just
[1:26:26] Can you say amen?
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; But there is a seed on the inside of you
[1:26:31] as a son of God. Even while you were in
[1:26:35] sins,
[1:26:37] there was a seed on the inside of you.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. that was going to overcome all
[1:26:43] things.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; And this the Bible says there in there
[1:26:46] in first uh first John 3, this is the
[1:26:50] victory that overcomes the world,
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; even our faith.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Where did the faith come from? The seed.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; So, here's here's the deal.
[1:27:08] If if you're not of God, you cannot
[1:27:10] believe.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; But you can be out in the world and you
[1:27:16] can have that concrete over the top of
[1:27:18] you for years and years and years and
[1:27:20] years and still be a son of God.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Come on now. You're in as dark as dark.
[1:27:27] Just like that woman at the well. She
[1:27:30] was a daughter of God.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; And yet she was living with another man.
[1:27:37] She had been married a bunch of times.
[1:27:40] She had Oh, she was she was one of those
[1:27:42] ill-famed ladies. Amen. Couldn't even
[1:27:44] come to the well at the same time that
[1:27:46] all the other ladies come to the well. I
[1:27:48] mean, this woman had a rough time. And
[1:27:50] yet Jesus says, "I've got to go to
[1:27:52] Samaria because I've got a daughter.
[1:27:56] I've got a You say a daughter?" Yes, it
[1:27:58] was a daughter. Now watch this. When the
[1:28:01] word came to her, Jesus just started
[1:28:04] asking. He said, "Amen. Um uh uh get get
[1:28:07] me a you know, can can you give me a
[1:28:09] drink of water?" And and and u and and
[1:28:12] she matters of fact let me just read it
[1:28:15] to you here.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think Well, I thought I was
[1:28:17] going to read it to you. Where where's
[1:28:19] that where's that at? I think it's in
[1:28:21] John. Can you pull that up? Amen. I need
[1:28:25] to go to Samaria.
[1:28:28] He needs be go to Samaria. I think the
[1:28:31] words. Hallelujah. Well, do you love
[1:28:33] him?
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now, I'm fixing to
[1:28:37] show you sins. Believer does not sin
[1:28:42] singular. That's unbelief.
[1:28:45] Believers have sins.
[1:28:49] The sin according to scripture is
[1:28:52] unbelief. The Bible says, "God so loved
[1:28:55] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:28:58] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:29:01] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:29:03] life." And then keep keep that scripture
[1:29:05] there, sister Keys. And then let let me
[1:29:07] just finish reading this here. Amen to
[1:29:09] you. Um so and then he says, Amen. Uh
[1:29:13] 17th verse three, St. John 3:17. For God
[1:29:16] sent not his son to condemn the world,
[1:29:18] but that the world through him might be
[1:29:20] uh through him might be saved. He that
[1:29:22] believes on him is not condemned, but he
[1:29:26] that believes not is condemned already,
[1:29:28] because he hath not believed in the name
[1:29:30] of the only begotten son of God. This is
[1:29:32] the condemnation that light is come into
[1:29:35] the world, and men love darkness rather
[1:29:37] than light, because their deeds were
[1:29:39] evil. For everyone that doeth evil
[1:29:41] hateth the light, neither cometh to the
[1:29:43] light, lest his deeds should be
[1:29:44] reproved. But he that doeth truth come
[1:29:46] to the light, that his deeds might be
[1:29:48] made manifest, that they are wrought in
[1:29:50] God. So there's going to be a group that
[1:29:52] is going to believe and there's going to
[1:29:54] be a group that cannot believe. The one
[1:29:57] who has believed upon the name of Jesus
[1:30:01] Christ is going to have many flaws.
[1:30:03] They're going to have many things that
[1:30:05] they've got to repent of daily. And I
[1:30:07] want to tell you there's a lot of blood
[1:30:09] that you'll never the blood will never
[1:30:13] never never come short. Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; But there's going to be that one that is
[1:30:20] not going to believe the word of God.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; They can't believe the word of God.
[1:30:24] There's nothing in them to believe with.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Well, how many knows I'm still in
[1:30:28] scripture. There's nothing in them to
[1:30:31] believe with.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; They can get caught up in the emotion.
[1:30:36] They can get caught up in the feeling,
[1:30:37] but there's nothing to believe with.
[1:30:41] Right,
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; man. That is sin,
[1:30:46] singular,
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; sin, unbelief, cannot believe the word.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; But then there's the elect.
[1:30:54] They're not willfully sinning because
[1:30:57] they've got the seed of God on the
[1:30:58] inside of them that is going to overcome
[1:31:01] everything.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. point to your neighbor and say
[1:31:05] that he said everything
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; going to overcome everything.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're facing today,
[1:31:14] but you're an overcomer because the seed
[1:31:16] of God's on the inside of me.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; You may say, "Brother Wendle, I'm in
[1:31:21] some sins right now." But what is that
[1:31:24] seed on the inside of you saying? Is it
[1:31:26] justifying your sin, or is it saying,
[1:31:28] "Buddy, you've got to come out." Is is
[1:31:31] that something on the inside saying,
[1:31:33] "Come on up a little bit higher. Come on
[1:31:35] up. Get out of that chicken yard. You
[1:31:37] don't belong in that chicken pin. Get
[1:31:39] up. Get out. I've called you to the
[1:31:41] higher heights. You're an eagle, not a
[1:31:43] chicken."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; God ain't got no squawking chicken.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; God's got eagles.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Eagles up there in the heavens. Well,
[1:31:52] can you say amen?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; You're an overcomer. You right. Oh, God.
[1:32:00] This is the victory that overcomes the
[1:32:02] world, even our faith.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; You can't help but overcome.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look here. Let's just read
[1:32:07] this story here together, and I'm going
[1:32:09] to close. He must needs go through
[1:32:12] Samaria.
[1:32:14] Then cometh he to a city of Samaria,
[1:32:18] which he c which is called Siar,
[1:32:21] near to the parcel of ground that Jacob
[1:32:23] gave to his son Joseph.
[1:32:26] Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore
[1:32:30] being wearied with his journey
[1:32:33] sat thus on the well. Now remember last
[1:32:35] week when I preached on God in another
[1:32:38] form the form of God.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; He was weary in that that form was
[1:32:43] weary. But within that form was that
[1:32:46] great that great logos that pillar of
[1:32:50] fire. He was as the prophet said Melzdc
[1:32:54] is no longer heard of because Melzdc
[1:32:57] becomes Jesus Christ. as Melzdc came to
[1:33:01] meet meet Abraham.
[1:33:04] And when he met Abraham, the Bible says
[1:33:07] that he was in such awe with this great
[1:33:11] priest king that when the when the kings
[1:33:15] of Sodom and Gomorrah all come and was
[1:33:19] and was fixing to to to bestow honors
[1:33:22] upon him, what did Abraham do? Abraham
[1:33:25] threw up his hand and he says, "I have
[1:33:27] already lifted my hand to the to
[1:33:31] Almighty God, the possessor of heaven
[1:33:35] and earth. I will not take even a shoe
[1:33:38] latch from you."
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; The presence of God, he recognized it.
[1:33:44] It's that same presence that was in the
[1:33:47] body of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; It sat on the well. It was about the
[1:33:50] sixth hour.
[1:33:53] There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
[1:33:56] water. And Jesus said unto her, "Give me
[1:33:58] to drink." And his disciples were going
[1:34:02] away unto the city to buy meat. And then
[1:34:05] saith the woman of Samaria unto him,
[1:34:07] "How is it that thou being a Jew? Asked,
[1:34:12] drink of me, which am a woman of
[1:34:14] Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings
[1:34:17] with the Samaritans?"
[1:34:19] And Jesus answered and said unto her, If
[1:34:22] thou kneest the gift of God, who it is
[1:34:25] that saith to thee, Give me to drink,
[1:34:27] thou would have asked of him. And he
[1:34:31] would have given thee living water. And
[1:34:34] the woman said unto him, Sir, thou hast
[1:34:36] not, thou has nothing to draw with, and
[1:34:39] the well is deep from whence then hast
[1:34:42] thou this living water?
[1:34:45] Art thou greater than our father Jacob,
[1:34:48] which gave us the well, and drank
[1:34:50] thereof himself and his children and his
[1:34:52] cattle? Jesus answered and said unto
[1:34:55] her, Whosoever drinkketh of the water of
[1:34:58] this water shall thirst again. But
[1:35:01] whosoever drinkketh of the water which I
[1:35:03] give him shall never thirst, but the
[1:35:07] water which I shall give him shall be in
[1:35:09] him a well of water springing up into
[1:35:12] everlasting life. Now watch this. It's a
[1:35:14] natural conversation, just a normal
[1:35:15] conversation going on with this woman
[1:35:17] that
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She she she's matter of fact
[1:35:21] his disciples come back and they were
[1:35:23] wondering what in the world is he doing
[1:35:25] talking to this woman all by himself.
[1:35:27] Now watch the woman sith unto him, sir.
[1:35:33] Watch your heart. Watch your heart.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; She was under the concrete.
[1:35:40] She was a seed of God.
[1:35:43] They say that this woman had been turned
[1:35:45] loose as a girl, as a girl. And she had
[1:35:49] to fend for herself. And then it come
[1:35:52] through all of the routine until now
[1:35:55] here she is. And the woman said, "Sir,
[1:35:59] give me this water." He didn't have to
[1:36:02] explain it, but he said that I thirst
[1:36:05] not, neither come hither to draw.
[1:36:08] Jesus said unto her, "Go call thy
[1:36:11] husband and come hither."
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; And the woman said, "I have no husband."
[1:36:19] Jesus said unto her, now watch this.
[1:36:22] Watch what now the supernatural is
[1:36:24] beginning to come in and discern.
[1:36:25] There's that word in a body. Thou hast
[1:36:28] said, "Well,
[1:36:30] I have no husband."
[1:36:32] For thou hast had five husbands, and
[1:36:37] whom thou he whom thou hast is not thine
[1:36:40] husband,
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; in that thou saidest truly. And the
[1:36:45] woman said unto him, "Sir,
[1:36:48] I perceive you're a prophet.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Our fathers worshiped in this mountain,
[1:36:53] and you say that in Jerusalem is the
[1:36:56] place where men ought to worship."
[1:37:00] Jesus said unto her,"Woman, believe me,
[1:37:01] the hour comes when you will neither
[1:37:03] worship in this mountain, or yet in
[1:37:05] Jerusalem, worship the Father.
[1:37:09] Ye worship know not what." We know what
[1:37:12] we worship, for salvation is of the
[1:37:14] Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is,
[1:37:19] now watch this. Revelation, when the
[1:37:21] true worshippers shall worship the
[1:37:24] Father in spirit and in truth. For the
[1:37:28] father seeketh such to worship him.
[1:37:32] God is a spirit, and they that worship
[1:37:34] him must worship him in spirit and in
[1:37:36] truth. And the woman said unto him, I
[1:37:39] know that the Messiah come that the
[1:37:42] Messiah's cometh,
[1:37:45] which is called Christ, and when he
[1:37:47] comes, he will tell us all things. And
[1:37:50] Jesus said unto her, I that speak unto
[1:37:54] thee am he. Now watch your watch your
[1:37:58] watch what happened next.
[1:38:01] And upon this come his disciples and
[1:38:03] marveled that he talked with the woman.
[1:38:05] Yet no man said what what seekest thou
[1:38:08] or why talkst thou with her? The woman
[1:38:11] then left her water pot went her way
[1:38:14] into the city and said to the men,
[1:38:18] "Come see a man which has told me all
[1:38:20] things that I ever did. Is not this the
[1:38:24] Christ?"
[1:38:25] The attitude.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; The attitude that she had. She was a
[1:38:32] woman that would not be accepted in a
[1:38:35] church,
[1:38:37] but Christ had to come and redeem her.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; And it was the word that come. That word
[1:38:44] was what separated him from all of the
[1:38:46] other guys. It was the word that separ
[1:38:50] y'all hearing me. It's the word that has
[1:38:53] separated. Amen. This present day word
[1:38:57] from all of the other guys.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Melzdc has come back
[1:39:03] in this day discerning the hearts and
[1:39:07] the thoughts of the people, drawing you
[1:39:10] and me back to himself in redemption.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; You might have plenty of things you're
[1:39:18] going to have to repent of. And before
[1:39:20] the day is over with, I'm sure we're all
[1:39:22] going to have a lot of things to repent
[1:39:23] of.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that seed on the
[1:39:27] inside of you can never do.
[1:39:31] It cannot
[1:39:32] disbelieve.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Well, that just makes me want to shout.
[1:39:43] We're going to line our thoughts,
[1:39:47] our actions, our everything, our belief
[1:39:50] system right in line with that word. And
[1:39:54] we will overcome.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; We will mature. We will see a rapture.
[1:40:00] And it's all by grace.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; If the musicians would come.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? here this morning.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is there is something
[1:40:17] there is there is that something on the
[1:40:20] inside that keeps on pulling me. What's
[1:40:23] that what's that song? Something keeps
[1:40:24] pulling me
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; holding me every day. I see.
[1:40:29] Amen.
[1:40:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:35] And then there's uh uh
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; I feel the pool. Yeah. Those those songs
[1:40:43] like that that that can only that that
[1:40:44] can only be had by the believer.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Many are the afflictions of the
[1:40:53] righteous, but the Lord delivers them.
[1:40:54] The trials must come. The trials are
[1:40:57] going to come to every one of us. And
[1:40:58] you may be in a real dark trial here
[1:41:01] this morning.
[1:41:03] Maybe you're in a real deep trial,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; but remember the trying of your faith is
[1:41:09] more precious than of gold.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; That That's exactly right.
[1:41:16] It's more precious
[1:41:18] according to First Peter.
[1:41:21] Amen. James uh uh uh alludes to the same
[1:41:25] thing. There's got to be a trying.
[1:41:28] There's got to be something to overcome.
[1:41:30] There's got to be things in our lives.
[1:41:34] Listen, if we were all if if if if we
[1:41:37] were if everyone was where they needed
[1:41:39] to be, Amen. Well, we would the rapture
[1:41:42] would have already taken place, but
[1:41:44] God's still dealing with somebody.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; He's still dealing with me.
[1:41:49] Here's the deal.
[1:41:52] The song that we sing, the more that I
[1:41:55] surrender,
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; the lighter my load,
[1:41:59] the more that I release myself, the more
[1:42:02] he takes control.
[1:42:05] Why? Why? Why is it that we cannot be
[1:42:08] just one of those nominal churches that
[1:42:10] Christians that's just going to go to
[1:42:11] church occasionally?
[1:42:13] We're in this thing. We're in this thing
[1:42:15] for the long haul.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; We We are in this thing. We are we we
[1:42:19] are that's why we come to church. You
[1:42:21] can't get enough church because there's
[1:42:23] something within us that is saying I
[1:42:26] want more of God. I want to learn more.
[1:42:28] I I want to overcome more. I want And
[1:42:31] every time we come to church, we're
[1:42:33] growing in him.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; But then we go outside the doors
[1:42:38] and God takes those things that we're
[1:42:40] learning, those things that we feel in
[1:42:41] his presence
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; and he starts burning it in us.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; He starts burning it within us. And
[1:42:48] there's where the trials come and the
[1:42:50] tribulations and all of the hardships.
[1:42:53] And there's where the devil tells you,
[1:42:54] you're not a son of God. You're not a
[1:42:57] daughter of God. But there's nothing in
[1:42:59] you. He just can't convince you to
[1:43:01] disbelieve the word.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; He can't He can't convince you to to
[1:43:08] turn away on God
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; because that's who you are.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Well, bless the Lord. Amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you lip your wife this
[1:43:16] morning on the way to church, you're
[1:43:18] still a son of God.
[1:43:21] Don't be justifying your deed. Son of
[1:43:23] God ain't going to justify a sin. Sins,
[1:43:26] we have sins and we've got to repent of
[1:43:28] them. And in order to repent, you've got
[1:43:30] to admit that you're wrong, fella. You
[1:43:33] got Well, praise the Lord.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; And you ladies have got to to to admit
[1:43:38] you're wrong occasionally.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] These these are these are areas in our
[1:43:49] we are overcoming. We are maturing. We
[1:43:53] are growing. The more we mature,
[1:43:57] the less we're listening to this,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; The less the less we're petting this.
[1:44:07] And and if you if you notice how the how
[1:44:09] the prophet has just always gone back
[1:44:10] and saying just one word was all it
[1:44:12] took. One word. One word. But he said
[1:44:16] there's a bride that will not even have
[1:44:19] one word. She will believe every word.
[1:44:25] [Applause]
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; She will believe every word.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Let me grow Lord.
[1:44:37] Corinthians were the fleshly church.
[1:44:39] They were carnal.
[1:44:41] Oh my. There is no there is no there is
[1:44:45] no epistle in the New Testament. The the
[1:44:47] the church of Colossia didn't have the
[1:44:50] problem. The church of Philippi, the
[1:44:52] church of Ephesus,
[1:44:54] the the Hebrew, they it was the
[1:44:57] Corinthian church. He said, "You're big
[1:44:59] babies. You're babies.
[1:45:03] You're carnal.

[1:45:20] what they And he's saying, "Come on,
[1:45:23] guys.

[1:45:27] Apollos baptized you?
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:32] Who cares whether you like
[1:45:37] so and so singing over somebody else's
[1:45:39] singing?
[1:45:42] What matters is
[1:45:46] well, praise the Lord. We could really
[1:45:47] bring it on down to our right.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We could we could do that in our
[1:45:51] little fellowships. We could do that
[1:45:53] even with our uh in the dinners. We
[1:45:55] could do that with a we could do that
[1:45:57] with a with song leaders. We could do I
[1:45:59] mean listen if if you want to be fleshly
[1:46:02] I mean we can be fleshly
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; but I don't want to hear those words the
[1:46:11] time that you need to be you should be
[1:46:13] teachers
[1:46:17] [Music]
[1:46:19] you have need to go back to kindergarten
[1:46:22] and to be taught all over again.
[1:46:27] Now, could you imagine a 30-year-old man
[1:46:30] going back and sitting on the little
[1:46:31] kindergarten desk?
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:39] Or better yet,

[1:52:40] his temptation
[1:52:44] and his desire to steal away
[1:52:49] my faith.
[1:52:50] [Music]
[1:52:52] that I have found in time.
[1:52:57] This revelation,
[1:53:01] the strength I need to keep me in.

[1:53:47] who's interceding.
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; He gave it. That's of himself. And you
[1:53:55] believing
[1:53:57] it's of himself, too.
[1:54:01] He tells Peter, I am praying for your
[1:54:05] faith that it fails you not.
[1:54:09] So he gives the promise and then he
[1:54:13] gives you the faith and then he's
[1:54:15] interceding for your faith that your
[1:54:18] faith fails not.
[1:54:20] [Music]

[1:54:32] you.

[1:54:38] come from the supernatural side. Yes,
[1:54:41] you came from your mama and we're
[1:54:44] thankful for your mama and you need to
[1:54:45] honor your mother.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:55:01] just have a hard time believing that."
[1:55:03] Well, they couldn't believe it in Jesus
[1:55:04] day either,
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:06] But you are the form.

[1:55:11] You somebody say, "I
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; I
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; am God's form."
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; God's form.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; You're the one.
[1:55:19] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You
[1:55:21] know, it's so simple, but yet it's so
