[Music] As I kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night, I'm praying for assurance everything's going to be all right. Lord, I see another battle out in front of me. I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down in defeat. He said, "Do you remember where I brought you from? Just take a look behind you at how far you come. And every time you ask me, didn't I deliver you? So why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through? Oh, ded. And I calmed the raging seas. I spoke to the wind.

That's what we want. Amen. Is the is the word of God. I I want us to look here in the book of First Corinthians the 15th chapter. And I do want to say it's just so nice to have brother Timothy and and Sister Ashley and the family uh to be here with us again tonight is a surprise surprise this morning and a surprise tonight. Amen. And uh uh we're very proud of what the Lord is doing there in in Noel, Missouri. And um I I know that they've got a wonderful man of God and and a and a great family of God. Praise the Lord. And uh so Amen. Um we're we're going to Um, look here at at uh 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and the 19th verse. And don't turn me down too very low. My voice is pretty weak tonight. But it says, "If this life if we in this life only we have hope in Christ, we of all men are most miserable." So we as a believer, even as a believer, if we have hope only in this life, then we we've we've got there's not too much to look forward to. But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man come death, by man also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive, and every man in his own order. Christ the first fruits. Afterward, they that are Christ at his coming. Now, we're going to read a little bit more, but I'm going to let's let's have a word of prayer and let you have your seats. Father, we want to thank you today. Thank you for this great peace that you have given us that we have found through your blood. And I I thank you, Lord, for your redeeming grace. How that you have sought us out, Lord. You've you've known exactly where we were born. You've known exactly everything about us. Lord, you know everything about me. You know all of you you you you know all of the misgivings in my mind and heart. You know all the you you know everything about me. And Lord, you know everything about every man and woman in this building here tonight. And you've brought us to your grace, Lord, because you have loved us. And you've you've brought us, Lord, to where you can mend us. and and and Lord, make us like you. And we thank you for that. Now, Lord, we're just asking that your words of life would minister to our hearts tonight. And we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated here today. I'd like to continue on down. Amen. in the start at the 42nd verse. Amen. Now, we're all a part of Adam's fall. We all die because of Adam's Adam's uh fall and and his sin. But Christ has come to bring us life. &gt;&gt; And that life is what is most important to us all. And I want us to look at eman this the promise that has been given to us in the 42nd verse of the 15th chapter. So also is the resurrection of dead of the dead. It is sown in corruption. It is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness. It is raised in power. It is sown in a natural body. It is raised in a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body. So it is written the first man Adam was a living soul but the last man Adam was a quickening spirit. How be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterwards that which is spiritual. The first man is from earth. That is from your first birth. That is where we're born. We're born sinners. We're born We're born with We're really born with all of our wires messed up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing's computing the way that it should be. We're all We're not We're not in an old uh mechanic uh uh terminology. We're not running on all eight cylinders. We're not here. We're not there yet. Amen. because of the sin. It says um it where was I at? Hallelujah. Amen. 47. The first man is of the earthy. The second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthly, such are they also that are earthly. As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. As we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Neither does corruption inherit incorruption. But I show you a mystery that we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump. For the trump shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall be put shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory. Oh, death, where is thy steam? Oh grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin. The strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much as you know that your labor is not in vain &gt;&gt; in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that just wonderful? &gt;&gt; That's the hope of what we that's that's our hope that the hope of a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why Jesus said, "You must be born again." &gt;&gt; And when Nicodemus says, "Well, we don't. How can I be born again? How can a man go back into his mother's womb?" And Jesus says, "Oh, the flesh is of the flesh." But what God is doing is he's restoring something back. Restoring us back to the original. Amen. There is a a relationship back with God. &gt;&gt; Now, every one of us, I don't care how cute you are and how handsome you are. Amen. We are all from the fall. We are all in a fallen condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I used to have a full head of hair. I I I I I used to used to have a voice that wasn't crackly. I used to used to have uh uh you know, I I didn't have scars on my body and didn't have to deal with my bad back and my joints that that ache and burn and Amen. I I I but but as I live, the the more that I find that I am I am finite. I've got these wrinkles on my hands and in my face and Amen. It shows that I can't live here. I I I'm I'm in a I'm in a fallen body. &gt;&gt; And if your if your body is fallen, so is your mind. &gt;&gt; Your mind is is is is your mind isn't the way God originally made it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can't depend on our mind. &gt;&gt; We can't depend on our body. You put you put your confidence in your body and before you know it, Amen. One mishap, one wreck or one or or just getting old and and and and and and you start losing your hair, you start turning gray, you start getting fat after the babies are here. You've got your you you you've got the the the the the baby fat. You've got all of these things here that would ruin what you would think would be perfect. There is nothing perfect about you. We're all born with with our minds muddled &gt;&gt; and messed up. &gt;&gt; But there is a promise. And as I as I get older, I begin to think about that life and what that what that heavenly life means. &gt;&gt; As I'm getting older, I'm beginning to I'm beginning to think, amen, more about that life than what I can do with this life. &gt;&gt; I'm beginning to see what matters to me most. What matters to me most is not riches and houses and land and it's not what I can possess. Amen. But it's what I do possess in this new birth that God has given me. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. This one can't last. This is full of sorrow and misery. Amen. as as good of his life as as it's been. Even being a Christian, it it's full of sickness and sorrow and misery. Amen. And hurt there. It's this life, Amen. is is is full of death. Everywhere you look, it's death. &gt;&gt; The trees out there right now that look pretty. Amen. With this hate that's coming in, the grass is starting to burn. Leaves are starting to turn colors. is because there's nothing that's lasting here. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that's lasting here. &gt;&gt; Amen. It won't be long and everything will begin to die. &gt;&gt; Well, so will a man. I don't care how young and beautiful or how young and good-looking you are. &gt;&gt; Man, there's nothing of this earth that'll last. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But what we have, we have a promise. We have a promise that we're going back to that that God amen ordained. Well, praise the Lord. The Bible says there in second Peter 3 and9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some count slackness but is longsuffering to us for &gt;&gt; oh longsuffering. God knows us where we are and he's longsuffering. not willing that any of us should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in holy conversation or lifestyle and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt uh with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to the promise look for a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness. This is something that God has given us. There's going to be a land where there's no turmoil in the mind. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a land. We are We are preparing for a land where there will be no more Amen. burying our mamas and grandmas, burying our children. We're going to a land where there is where where there is peace of mind, peace of heart, &gt;&gt; where there is no sorrow, where there is no no uh h regrets of yesterday. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where we're not hurt and where others can't hurt us. We're preparing for that. &gt;&gt; The the resurrection is genuine. Brother Brandon was asked one time by his wife. He said, "Amen. Uh uh uh you know, Billy, you're you're losing your hair." Amen. And he says, "I want you to know I've not lost a one." And she says, "Well, well, pray tell me where where your hair's going." Amen. He says, "I'll I'll ask you a question. You tell me where they came from before I got them, and I'll tell you they're there waiting on me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I came from the earth. &gt;&gt; And you all, every one of us come from the 16 elements. For now, science says 21 elements of the earth. Amen. We've all come from that. Your hair came from that. Everything about you, you come from that element. And I just want to tell you the power of that resurrection is so great, Kobe, that no matter where we are, no matter if this if if there was a bomb and I exploded, hallelujah, and pieces of me went that way and that way and that way and that way and that way and every which way. When the resurrection come, there will not be one hair lost. &gt;&gt; There will not be one body part missing. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Sister Denise, you're fixing to have some things taken out of you. Hallelujah. But when you get on the other side, you're not going to be a half of a woman. You're going to be you're going you're going to be everything. Amen. That God had in the beginning in his mind. &gt;&gt; The resurrection, there is a peace that comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a there this is Amen. on that resurrection morning. There is nothing that is going to be left behind. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to say we're making preparation for that right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. The new birth is not coming to church. It's not turning a new leaf. The new birth is where God comes in and does something really special for you. &gt;&gt; He comes in and changes you and he puts the pieces together. Hallelujah. Amen. Right now in your when you're when you're not born again. Amen. Your mind and your and and and your body and things just aren't quite there. Your soul, it's not that the the wires aren't all connected together yet. But when God comes into that soul, he connects the pieces and the wires come together to where you can communicate with God to where you feel whole. &gt;&gt; Because of the fall, every man dies. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was asked of a doctor. Do you believe that we're made of the elements of the earth? And he says, "Well, of course, man." He says, "Uh, that's why we have to live off the food of the earth because we all came from the earth to replenish the vitamins and minerals in our bodies." And and then the prophet would ask, he said, "Then why is it that that I'm eating the same foods that I ate when I was a kid? When I was a kid, I ate those foods and I got strong and stronger and stronger and and taller. I grew. But there came a certain time to where I'm eating the same food and now I'm getting weaker and weaker and weaker. &gt;&gt; What what what caused it? He says, he says it would be like this this glass of water and you're pouring the water in and it comes up and it comes up and it comes up and then all of a sudden it reaches a peak and then it begins to go down further and it the more you pour in the lower it goes. &gt;&gt; You see that's where we are. &gt;&gt; We we there is nothing eternal here. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. But I will say here, amen, as just as God in the original was creating Adam and when he was thinking of Adam in his mind, I believe God had a real special thought for every one of you. Just like he had a special thought for Adam, he knew us all. And before God created Adam, &gt;&gt; he man, he had to create the earth. That's right. &gt;&gt; Every carpenter has to lay out his materials. &gt;&gt; Amen. He looks at his plans and and and and the design and and and then he then he goes and he and he and he brings his materials in. How many knows that, you know, with you us electricians or carpenters or whatever, you bring your materials in, get it all lined up together so that you can do your project. &gt;&gt; Well, God couldn't just go pick up some things when making use. So God had to create a world for you. &gt;&gt; God created Amen. If you could if you could think of it like this, a great Amen. the great clinker. Amen. When the earth, it was just a a just a clinker off of the sun. May maybe a maybe a volcanic stone that that came off the sun and and the Bible says it was void and and it was it was shapeless and without form and there was chaos everywhere. Amen. And and God Amen. But what was God doing within that volcanic rock, if you will? Amen. Was everything that your body was going to be needing? &gt;&gt; God had developed it. God made the earth with a specific purpose &gt;&gt; to make man. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Within that rock, God knew what he was doing within the earth. This void form formless earth, this chaotic earth that was dark. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But yet in that earth was was potsh and calcium and phosphorus and there there was sulfur and sodium and zinc and and magnesium and copper and everything everything that was going to be needed to create you. &gt;&gt; God put it all together. Hallelujah. God would begin his project and he'd begin to turn the earth around the sun and Amen. begin to begin to move it around and shape it the way he wanted it. Amen. And molding it and shaping it because he had a he had a grand scheme. He was fixing to bring life out of something that was formless. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was fixing to bring light into a world that was dark. He was fixing to take nothingness and to bring something out of it. Now, I want you to catch this because I I I want you to truly understand when God was making this, the earth already contained everything that was needed. &gt;&gt; But yet, it was dark without form. It was void. There was nothing in it. &gt;&gt; But yet God knew what was on the inside. And let me just say this here tonight, just sort of getting ahead of my thoughts. When God in you, in your walk, in your life right now, sometimes it can seem dark. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's like it's void. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes because of our past. Amen. Maybe sometimes we're born. We we we we were born while mom and dad were we're we're were we're we're in we're we're we're we're we're on drugs. And maybe maybe that has shaped some portion of our life. &gt;&gt; M maybe maybe we were uh molested as a child. M maybe we were hurt when we were when we were in in in some point and somewhere it just seems like our life has been with was shapeless. It seems like it's had no purpose. It seems like there's been nothing there. And and you might look in the mirror and you might say, "I don't like the man that I see." But on the inside, God's already got a design for you. On the inside is a soul. &gt;&gt; On the inside, God's all Are you hearing me? The earth &gt;&gt; was without form. It was void. &gt;&gt; It was empty. &gt;&gt; It was dark. &gt;&gt; It looked hopeless. But when God, according to his purpose, God knew what he was doing. And God would take the earth, begin to rotate it around the sun, and begin to mold it and make it because God was fixing to build a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God's good at taking nothingness &gt;&gt; and making masterpieces. God's good at taking us when we don't even understand ourselves. &gt;&gt; When we don't even understand our purpose. When we look in the mirror, we don't we don't we don't know why we are like we are. And we don't know what is going to help us to change. And we just we want to hide. But here, where are we going to go? God sees that. And I want to say God knew it was going to be there before you was ever born. &gt;&gt; God's already placed something on the inside of you and he's going to bring out a masterpiece in you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God would begin to take this this volcanic rock, if you will, and the great pillar of fire would be like a little dove. It would come upon that earth and it would come down and begin to melt a little bit of this pot ash and a little bit of this and begin to begin to melt and begin to form and before you know it, up come a little Easter lily. And God would say, "That's good." God would take this rock and then he would as he would hover and make love to it and and and and begin to brood over the earth, that pillar of fire and before you know it, here come the botney light. Flowers begin to grow and trees begin to grow. &gt;&gt; Before you know it, the great forest, Mount Everest, come. Amen. Before you know it, there were there were all of these things begin to come up because the Holy Spirit was bring the seeds were already there. &gt;&gt; Go back and read the Bible. The Bible didn't say that God created those seeds. He says he gave permission for those seeds to live and to pre-produce. Can you say amen? We look at those, we understand that those seeds were created from another were there from another civilization. But God created and I just want to say those seeds that God originally had in his mind concerning you, in his mind before the sin, before the fall, before those kinds of things that ever come into play, those seeds were already there from another civilization. And it was a heavenly civilization. &gt;&gt; And all God does, God will bring he he'll come and brood over your soul and he'll come and move upon you. Oh, can you say amen? Amen. As he begin to make love to the earth and the elements begin to melt and soon came up a lily and the botney life begin to grow and and then one by one the animal life begin to come as as God was brooding over the earth. And how excited God must have been to see how his plan was coming together. He was bringing chaos. He was turning the chaos into order. &gt;&gt; When we come to the Lord, we don't have it all made up. When we come to God, our lives are full of wretchedness. And sometimes on the inside, I man, you look and you look at the great big oak tree and you say, "I'd love to be that." You look at this. You think, "If I could be that." You look around and here you are in your brokenness. But I just want to say, "Amen. God's got a seed down deep in the heart for that to come up." And it and God knows what he's making. Are y'all are y'all understanding what I'm saying? Amen. What What was God doing? He was bringing life. He was bring He was turning chaos into order. He was beginning life was beginning to come forth. Life and joy and peace and tranquility and harmony and love. And God was looking there with great pride and and and and and love and appreciation as he watched the birds chirp and the butterfly go from flower to flower. He was there watching Leo the lion and and and and Miss Cheetah walking down. It was a beautiful thing that God had made. But this was only setting the stage for the grand finale. This was beautiful. This was good. But this was only setting the stage. God was just building all of the props for his greatest intention was man. God was fixing to build a masterpiece of his own image. &gt;&gt; God was fixing and I I He was fixing to create himself. He was fixing to build one just like him. &gt;&gt; And he would give dominion &gt;&gt; and authority. This man would walk as God would walk. Are Are you hearing me? He designed the earth. He created all of the plains of Kansas, the the the hills of Arkansas, the the m the rugged mountains of Utah. He He's created the the rugged terrain of Oklahoma. Hallelujah. He created He created it all for his children. He created the variety of flowers. There was white flowers, blue flowers, red flowers, purple flowers. God created these for his children that he was fixing to create. &gt;&gt; God God was making it the the the great waterfalls coming down. He was doing it for the purpose of his children. Right? &gt;&gt; The day come when God made Adam and this would be the highlight of all of his creation. This would be the highest of all species. God would make this man. God would make this. Let us make man in our own image. God was going to make his very own son. This created being would reflect the very image of God. For God is now creating his own species and man would be their sole ruler over the creation. But Adam was lonely. Adam was lonely. The Bible, brother Brandon would tell us that he had something within him that he needed to express because Adam was both male and female in the one person. And here he was living in this body, but yet here he was. He didn't have a way to express. He didn't he was lonely. So the Bible says that God put Adam to sleep and he pulled out of his rib and he created out of Adam, not the dirt, out of Adam, he created a woman. He created a help me. Are are you hearing me? Eve was not new. Eve would find her fulfillment in Adam because Eve was created in Adam. Amen. And here, Amen. as as as as when Adam grew up woke up and Amen. He he would he would see this beautiful bride and he would take her out and show her his world and and and begin to amen explain. I I I I've named all of these animals. Look at what father has given. and Adam and Eve was in was in perfect harmony. It was a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; Then we understand that the serpent crawled underneath the gates of the garden and he would lure Eve and bring death upon the earth and then the whole creation would mourn. Creation would mourn. I I I believe that the sun even darkened. The clouds came over. The sun just refused to shine. The stars, the botney life, the animal life, the planets, the solar system, everything was trembling because God's son had fallen. And Adam and Eve would now be driven from the garden. And there would be a great cherubam that were that were put there to guard with flaming swords of fire. And no man would ever be able to get to the tree of life or to come into that garden. And now it is chaos and brokenness. Chaos and brokenness would now become the norm of this new creation. Chaos and brokenness. Because man and woman without God is broken. And when a man or a woman is out of their place, creation has no ruler. There is no master. So creation in itself would be broken and without a ruler. Eve's very own son killed his twin brother. It was a spiral of of of regrets. I hope I'm okay here tonight. Not going to hold you too too long. So, y'all stay with me. You can see Adam and Eve going to the garden gate and remembering the things that used to be inside it. Adam and Eve remembered what it was like to walk with God. Adam and Eve, they remembered what it was like to fellowship with God in the evening. Adam and Eve knew these things. But now here they are in brokenness. There's their bodies are getting old. There's no fellowship between them and God. The eldest Eve's eldest son has now killed his brother. It's chaos. And the world has gone through chaos. There's been wars. There's been there's been rumors of wars. The the the earth has been full of just madness forever. God even said he was going to have to he repented making man because of all the sin and the great flood come and Monoah was the only one saved and but all along God's given a promise that there would be somebody that would be able to find peace. And now from the rest of this my thoughts here for the next 10 minutes, I want you to really listen to me because mankind was not just kicked out of the garden. And that story that I told you is a real story. &gt;&gt; Man has great built great feats. It was after the Garden of Eden that man got together and they was going to build a tower that would reach God. They wanted to reach God. They wanted to commune because they they they lack peace. They missed peace. They were guilty. They come under the condemnation of of of God's law. They sinned. And everyone that is born is built or is born under the condemnation of of guilt. guilt come is it's a judicial thing. You're pronounced guilty. Amen. The gabble is dropped. &gt;&gt; You're pronounced guilty and the punishment must follow. &gt;&gt; Peace is also a judicial thing. When you can have peace with God means somebody has satisfied the courts of the law. The the the courts of law &gt;&gt; where the guilt is totally away. &gt;&gt; The guilt has been paid for. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like being guilty. We've seen we we've seen what the presidential pardon can do. where where where people are in prison because they've been guilty and President Trump they've spent years in in in in prison but with the signing of a stroke of his pen. He's been they've been pardoned pardoned with prejudice. That means it can never be brought up again. It means they can never be charged again. That means everything has been taken care of. Jesus Christ. This is the reason we needed Jesus in our Why did Jesus die? Because you had a guilty verdict. &gt;&gt; I had a guilty verdict. And there is nothing there is nothing that religion can do to take away that guilt. They built a tower up to God trying to show God we want to come to you. &gt;&gt; But they were guilty. &gt;&gt; Men has tried through their sacrifices. They've tried to to to earn God's &gt;&gt; but they were guilty. A guilty man is guilty. Are you with me? you're guilty, somebody's got to take care of the payment. &gt;&gt; The reason that people are so messed up in their head today, the reason why people are still they go to church and yet they can't find peace is because God this coming to church don't give you peace. Playing music doesn't give you peace. Being a preacher doesn't give you peace. &gt;&gt; Saying a prayer doesn't give you peace. &gt;&gt; Because your soul is guilty. It's under the condemnation. It's been pronounced guilty. And there's only one that can remove that guilt from that soul. And that is one who would come to take your place. &gt;&gt; Somebody that's not guilty. Somebody that is able. a kinsman redeemer that is willing to take your place. Can I hear an amen? &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus done. Jesus came. Jesus never sinned. Jesus never rebelled. Jesus was not born with the condemnation of the sexual birth. His father was God just like Adam was in the beginning. When Jesus died, he paid the penalty so that he could remove the guilt. He removes the guilt so that we can have peace. Peace, peace. Jesus was on the water. Jesus was on o on the waves and and and and there he was sleeping in the boat and they the disciples were trying. They were the the the the the uh the waves begin to to come and the winds begin to blow and the storm was on and Jesus was asleep and they've done everything they can. They're they're trying to get the water out of the boat. They're about to sink. They've done everything. Finally, they come and wake him up. Amen. in here. Peter, Peter was the he he was the head he he was a good fisherman. He was a great boatman. He told Jesus to go sleep. He told Jesus, "I've got this under control. Just rest up. I'll get you across to the other side." But now Peter is saying, "Wake the master lest we perish." &gt;&gt; Jesus wakes up. Waves are blowing. The disciples saying, "We're fixing to die. We've done everything. We don't know what to do. We know nothing else to do. And Jesus, a man, stands up, puts his foot up on the the the bow of the ship, and he says, "Peace, be still." And that one word of that perfect son of God, all of a sudden, the winds quit blowing. The waves quit beating the boat. The disciples are all looking around and they're they're looking and they and they're fearful and they say, "What matter what manner of man is this? for even the winds and the waves obey him. They didn't realize that it was the same one &gt;&gt; that took chaos and brought it into order at the beginning is the same one &gt;&gt; that came in the body of Jesus &gt;&gt; so that he could bring order and peace back into the human heart. That one that stood there and said, "Peace be still." Was the same God in the beginning that look at the brokenness of this world and the brokenness and the emptiness and the formlessness of it and he bought beauty. It was that God who came down to give his life to pay his own penalty so that he can bring order &gt;&gt; into your chaos. Josh into your chaos. L &gt;&gt; my wife said she must have went to the restroom, but it was chaos taking her from a broken family. Her mama was never married. Man after man after man, drugs and alcohol was was just an everyday thing there. Brokenness, parties, hurts, regrets. In fact, her whole family, she's a twin, been broken. But my wife at a at a young age, she came to the same tent that her whole family came. Her whole family came to that tent. &gt;&gt; The whole family come to the tent. But it was my wife that came up to Christ and said, "I want you to take my chaos. I don't want you to turn it. Bring order. &gt;&gt; I'm broken. I'm hurt. I've been I I I I come from brokenness. &gt;&gt; But there was something that was drawing that girl. It didn't draw anyone else at that time, but there was something about my wife. It was drawing her to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And took that little girl, that little girl, and look at the beauty that God has made out of that life until here she is, a pastor's wife today. It's because somebody heard the words, "Peace." &gt;&gt; Peace in the midst of chaos. Peace in the midst of Amen. brokenness. Peace. We need to hear that from the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; We need to hear that from him tonight. Peace. If you're in your brokenness and your mind is just gets roaring on the inside, I want to say the same one that stood on the boat that night is the same one that died on Calvary so that you can have peace. &gt;&gt; Peace. We were all guilty. Maybe you come from an alcoholic family or you came from maybe you were drug addicts. Maybe you were church members. You come from brokenness. And there's none of us that is there's not a human being on this earth that is not broken. I came from a a Christian family. Mom and dad were godly, but I was born broken. Maybe I wasn't molested when I was a child. Maybe may maybe you're the one that was molested. Maybe you were raped. Or maybe maybe you were done wrong. Maybe mom didn't love you or mom maybe there's a lot of things and those things shape our lives. &gt;&gt; You take a little tree and it can be bent one way. You take that sapling and you you can train it and you can put a you can put a stick on it and it'll it'll but also and and and and when it grows up it'll grow up straight. But that same tree, if there was something else over it, man, and it won't let it grow up straight because something is over it. And it'll grow up crooked and it'll it'll it'll be hard on the root system. It'll be hard on a lot of things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We were looking yesterday, brother Nathaniel, we we seen one of the trees that got that had got hit by, you know, winds and things and part of it was gone. And he says, "You know, if you want me to, we can just we can just cut cut it down a little ways and and and then and then, you know, put a ratchet strap on it and see if we can pull the tree back up." It had a fork and it was going like this. And he and and and I looked at and the thing is that big around. And I I said, you know, I just I just don't know. I I think it's impossible. And and so, you know, so he he just went ahead and cut the thing down. But God don't cut nothing down. God don't throw nothing away. He's not going to throw his elect away. He's not going to throw you away. He loves you. He loves you with an undying love. And when the world says it can't happen, maybe in your own mind you say it can't happen, but yet God's got a ratchet strap that's big. God can make something new. God can bring order into your chaos. God can do He's the God of miracles. &gt;&gt; Peace. Peace be still. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Peace be still. You see, God is the one who created you. He knows how He knows how you're wired. And though the devil's got you all unwired, he knows how to put it all back together. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Peace. You see what we've needed? We don't need, we don't need money. &gt;&gt; Look at all the rich people out there. And they're on drugs and broken families. Money's just made them idiots. We don't need fame. Look at these famous guys. They can't They don't even have a lick of common sense anymore. We don't need fame. What we need is peace. And Jesus says the peace that I give, it's not the same kind of peace that the world would give through money or try to give through fame or try to give this. The peace that I give is the same peace that father god gave at the beginning. I've come to make everything right. I've come to make everything Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; To give you peace for the soul where you can actually stand up and you're no longer bent over, deformed. &gt;&gt; But this new birth could take that soul and lift you back up where you're not deformed anymore. where you can believe, &gt;&gt; where you can be productive, &gt;&gt; where the grace of God is expressed through you to where you become the great masterpiece that God just like he had in the beginning when this world was formless without without hope. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many wants that to be in your heart here tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. here. Look what going back to the judicial term there in Romans 5 and1. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's been satisfied. &gt;&gt; The judge were saying, "You're guilty. All have sinned and come short of the glory of God." You are guilty. That's what God's word said. And God couldn't go back on his word. But God created himself a body because you weren't going to be able to help yourself cuz you're a sinner. &gt;&gt; My little this little young right here that I love so much, she's born in sin. Who could do it? man was in a shape. Hallelujah. That's an old southern word. He's in a shape. That that means things are really bad. Who was going to stand for us? Who was going to help us? We were born in defeat. Born in brokenness, born in families of brokenness. &gt;&gt; Who's going to fight for us? Who's going to defend us? Mama don't care. Daddy don't care. This one don't care. The law don't care. God's looking down. He says, "I'll create a body and I'm going to live in that body and I'm going to go pay the penalty and I'm going to give that man, I'm going to give that boy, I'm going to give that girl peace." God almighty, I want to give him peace. Do you hear me? You see, that's what Christ is. justified by faith. Listen, 1 Corinthians 14 and 33, it says, "For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace." Say it with me. God &gt;&gt; is not the author &gt;&gt; of confusion. He's the author of peace. If you could hear me tonight and you could you you could just take as I'm as I'm preaching from my from from my inner soul here right now. If you can take it, you'll connect all the wires together. He'll take He'll take everything about us. Are you understanding? You see, that's what God has done because God had it fixed to that virgin-b born son. Hallelujah. Amen. The blood of that virgin-born son would totally reverse. It would bring us back to the position of sons. It would be that living logos word living in a body to feel your pain and suffering. He was tempted in every point like you. Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; was tempted in every point like you &gt;&gt; yet without sin. If you ever think about the power of the blood, sometimes we need to go back and look at the power of the blood. Because if you really have an understanding of what that blood means when we say when we say you're washed with the blood, what we're trying to say is what that is a metaphor. That mean that doesn't mean to go and you're not trying to find some blood and wash yourself with it. It's the man, the righteous man, the God man, the holy man. Jesus Christ died and with his blood, it broke the powers of sin in your life. It breaks everything in your life so that the that the power of eternal life can flow through you and can live its way through you. I don't care how broken you are tonight. I don't care what your upbringing is. I don't care. I don't care about those things. I I don't care. You can take the vilest of sinners &gt;&gt; and you can wash them with that blood. That blood is some detergent that is pretty powerful. They can take the power that has held you as a kid. Maybe maybe Uh uh you know there's there's there's been people in this building and and and and that that were molested when they were when they were kids and the power of that thing had affected them and it was a chain over them. But when the blood of Jesus comes in, you man, he has the power of that the the the power of that blood is greater than the power of that thing that has scarred your life. I've seen God take drag babies, amen, and had such a hard time. And I've seen God give them a new birth where they can think on their own and they can love God and they can praise families. I've seen God I've seen God take broken alcoholics and drug addicts and how God has made amen preachers out of them. They've seen them so bound by pornography, but the power of the blood is so great. Religion won't give you peace. It won't give you peace. You've got to come to the understanding that there was one. The reason why you don't have peace, the reason why you're in anguish in your heart, in your mind, is because you're under the condemnation of death, you're guilty. But if we can understand that this has already been paid for, your sins, your wrongs, &gt;&gt; your iniquities have already been paid for. &gt;&gt; I've seen him so bound I remember sitting in a in a meeting and it was there was a there was a man sitting on the front row here and he was a good we through the whole meeting. The man had been there been coming and he was he was mentally he he he was a real nice fella. He was about 30 years old. He But he he was he he was just what you know I'm I'm I'm looking for a word mentally You're not allowed to say that these days but whatever the words is for that. Mentally challenged and and and there he was. Good boy. We we we had shaken his hand. He was a good guy. But he just just vig you say little words. He could say hi. He could say this. That night I was I was three I was two rows back from him. And while the preacher was preaching, that devil that had him bound started challenging the preacher. Now, I didn't notice it, but when you're when you're up there and you're up here preaching, you do see things. You do understand things. You do know where spirits are coming from. And and the man stood there. The preacher stopped and he pointed at the man that was just an overgrown boy. He pointed at him and he says, "You have challenged the living God." And we're all going poor kid, man. 30 something years old. And all of a sudden, that man, he got real nervous. And as he sit there just just mentally, not. And the preacher said, "Stand to your feet." And the man stood to his feet and he said, "Satan, you have poked your head up at the wrong time. You who have bound that this man and has kept him from living a normal life, I command you to come out of him in the name of Jesus." And that spirit threw that boy clean out over into here. And there he was just shaking and and then he was still talking about making the hair stand up on your head. There was just an holy all and we all begin to pray and just plead the blood and just calling unto God. And after a while, the boy, I call him a boy cuz he was just a little child in his mind. Oh, God. He put up his knees and he stood up for the first time. He looked around to his aged mama come and hugged her neck and talked like a regular man. I shook his hand. I shook his hand. God took his Are y'all understanding me? There's nothing too hard for God. There's nothing too hard for God. God can take your brokenness &gt;&gt; and bring everything right into order. &gt;&gt; Joe and Stephanie was here this morning as they're moving. Heroin addicts for 20 years. Brokenness. one touch from the Lord that it produced something in their lives. Oh, how we could go, couldn't we just go right here in this church and just talk about brokenness? Couldn't we just go through this church? Look at you, Tina. How God took your life out of all of your family. Took your life. Took you out of brokenness. that has made a masterpiece out of you. It's nothing but God's grace. &gt;&gt; Look at you, Katrina. When I met you, you were broken. You were hurt. Your upbringing. You wouldn't be able to trust any human being. when you talked to me when you was just a girl, 14 years old, and the brokenness of your life. And look what God's done for you. &gt;&gt; He come to give us peace so that we can believe his word. We have a right to believe those things. And then we look at here what God's done for Sister Katrina and how we we could never do without Sister Katrina here at the church. Don't even think about moving. brokenness, emptiness, formlessness, and yet love. Love brooding over your heart heart, your hard ground begin to melt. this minerals, this pot ash, and these things all coming together and up comes beauty out of your life. We could go on through there. Even you, Caleb, the beauty that God's brought out of your life and the things that he that he's done, all of the miracles and how that God brought you in. You, Denise, how many foster homes were you in? 23 foster homes. No one wanted her. There might have been a reason for some of them not wanting her. She come from brokenness. Her very own daddy was doing things to those kids and that that that that that kids should never even have to never have to worry about. The protecting wasn't there for her. She was broken. 20 three foster homes. She was so rebellious as a teenager. Her rebellion she went out and got pregnant at a very early age. Broken brokenness continued even though she had a family. Brokenness continued. She lost her marriage. everything there so broken and he said I was not even able to shed a tear couldn't even cry but I believe you said it was one night in your in in in the hallway of your house couldn't go on any further she had to have peace. She had to have peace. And when she knelt down there in in that hall and said, "God, I need you." It was like rivers begin to flow out of her. And she wept and she wept and she wept as she accepted God's forgiveness and his peace. And it washed her and washed her and washed her. What would we do without Denise? &gt;&gt; She came in here to pony wanting the Holy Ghost, locked herself up and begin to pray and she said it just the Holy Ghost came upon her. What am I saying? God can still take chaos and make beauty. Should we talk about someone that we all know or most of us know and that's our sister Julie. Oh, Julie. She was rough on me owning that restaurant and she was rough on me. Oh, here's the preachers of the church of the skirt and here's this and here's that and she was just constantly she was open with about gays and she was open about oh my goodness and how God don't judge anything. One day I look out there and here comes Julie. Julie walking in and setting down. I I remember she she started coming occasionally to the services and then she be to come regularly and but Julie still needed God. She had been coming to church for a long time but she was still progay, pro- lesbian, pro pro whatever. She was pro sin, pro everything, man. And she was very vocal. One thing she wasn't pro and that wasn't that was men. She was not pro man. She hated men. Michael, you and I were in the were in the car that night. You and I were in the Carolas. We just came out of a meeting. Brother Hughes was with us. nearly calls me. She never would call me brother. It was always Wendle. She's on the phone and she said, "Wendle, where are you at? Why weren't you at church tonight?" Oh. And she is chewing me out. And I said, "Calm down. Calm down. What's going on, Wendle? Wendle, where wanted you to be here? Can Where are you at?" And I said, "It's okay, Julie. What's going on?" And I'm just trying to calm her down. And finally, once I get her settled down, she says, "I was in church tonight." And Jonathan was up there preaching. He was up there preaching about the blood of Jesus and how that he can take the vile sinner's heart. And while brother Jonathan was preaching, she says, "I don't understand. I don't know what happened. That's why I've got to call you." Amen. I don't know. But she says, "The ceiling opened up in that back row where I was at." And she said, "Water begin to come down over me and came up and washed over me and washed up and washed over me." And she's crying. And she says, "Wendall, I know that God has forgiven me." It was at that time he says, "You take every woman in that building, you take every person, you take everyone in that building and stack up all of their sins and it would not come near mine." He said, "I've had abortion after abortion. I've lived the vile unclean lives." And she began to tell me, "I've done this and I've done that." She said, "I'm not even worthy to be in that congregation with y'all. I'm a vile person. He said, "I've always stood out here and looked at y'all, and I've always looked, but I've thought, what can I do? Oh, I wish I could be like them, but I've messed my life up." She told me, she said, "But tonight, I know that I'm forgiven. &gt;&gt; All of my sins are forgiven." &gt;&gt; When the I'm one of you now. I'm one of you now. And we all love Sister Julie until the time that she's died. Can you say amen? What is What am I saying? And I told you it's only going to be a few minutes. Sorry. What am I What am I ministering here tonight is there's one that can still say, "Peace be still." God took all of your sin. and he took all of your shame. He took all of your and he and he and he put it on the cross. Hebrews 2:14 says, "For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that have the power of death, that is the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage." Verily, he took not on the nature of angels, but he took on the seed of Abraham. Wherefore, in all things that behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest, and things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people, Christ come to join us together. Revelations 1 and5. heaven from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead, the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and has made us kings and priests. Unto God and to his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Acts 20 and 28 he's given instruction to the apostles take heed or the elders of the church of Ephesus take heed therefore unto yourselves and to the over the flock over the which the holy the holy ghost has made you overseers to feed the church which he has purchased with his own blood peace Romans 5:9 Much more than being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. Ephesians 2:8. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. God's not brought you here just to be here. God's brought you here because God loves you. If you're hearing my preaching, I was talking to someone the other day, the other night as I was visiting, could feel the presence of God just coming down. And I made the statement. I said, "He's here. He's He's came three times. You feel his presence. That's the Holy Spirit letting you know that there is nothing impossible with God. And if we hear his presence, hear his voice here tonight through his servant. I'm his mouthpiece tonight. If we can hear his voice, not mine, but his peace, divine peace.

But many of times there are Christians and the devil has brought us into brokenness. And I want to say, you might be a Christian and and have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but you're needing peace in your heart. The one that gave it to you at the beginning can give you that peace again. He's the God of all peace. He's not the author of confusion. He's the author of While we sing this song tonight. If you've not given your heart to the Lord, don't wait one more night. I'm not talking about saying a prayer. I'm talking about coming and making sure that soul has found peace with God.

So Satan, if I were you, I turn around and give up to because you're bound to lose. Oh, I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline. Because I'm covered by your blood. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you may stare and you may fight. You're going to lose this battle tonight. Remember, can cross that bloodline. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[Music] &gt;&gt; God sends preachers to preach the gospel of peace. This message is the message of peace. The prophet of God could preach the message shalom. It's nighttime, but shalom. The world is in chaos, but shalom. &gt;&gt; No matter where we are, what this life holds, &gt;&gt; we're living under peace. Romans 10:15. How shall they preach except they be sent as it is written? How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace &gt;&gt; and bring glad tidings of good things. Romans 15 and 13. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost. 1 Thessalonians 5:23, the very God of peace sanctify you holy, and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Thessalonians 3:16. And the Lord now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The God, the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you. Peace. Aren't you glad for peace? Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Doesn't matter what where I'm at, what I'm facing. Doesn't matter where I'm at tomorrow. Satan, you're not going to take away from me what you have given me today. When you ever come before God and you find the realities of your soul, then you've got to drive a stake right there in the ground. Cuz Satan will come up to you tomorrow morning and say, "Oh, that was all a bunch of work up." Satan will come in and say, "Well, you didn't get anything." But you drive that stake today and say, "God has changed my life, and I'm not going to allow Satan to say anything different." &gt;&gt; If you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and you know you've received it, then don't let the devil talk you out of it. Hallelujah. If you come sincerely before God and you pour out your heart and you lay everything at the altar and you're believing God, then don't let the devil take anything away from you. Drive the stake in the ground right there where you are and say, "I am not going to give up an inch of ground that I have received tonight." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The God of all peace is right here. He's hovering over the building right now. He's hovering over you right now. Amen. Hallelujah. If you're still needing something from the Lord, then just reach out right now. He's still here. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Cover me. &gt;&gt; Cover me. Cover me. [Music] [Music] Sing that again. [Music] [Music] through the storm. Only in you and only you I and only in you I only in you I find peace. Cover me. Cover me. Oh, cover me when I am hurt. Cover me when I'm not strong. Cover me when I am going through the stor. Cover me when all seems hopeless. Cover me when my faith is gone and the peace that passes understand [Music] me. Peace of God. Oh God, cover me. Cover me through the storm. Only in you and only I am safe. Only in you and only in you I'm secure. Yes, I am. Only in you I find peace to cover me. Cover me. Oh, cover me when I am hurting. Cover me when I'm not strong. Cover me when I am going through the storm. Oh, cover me when all seems hopeless. Cover me when my faith is gone. Let the peace that passes all understand. Oh, cover me when I give. &gt;&gt; Cover me when I'm not strong. Cover me when I am going through the stor. &gt;&gt; Cover me when I seeless. Cover me when my faith is gone. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let the peace that passes all &gt;&gt; understand. [Music] Amen. Amen. I'm thankful for that. In serving the Lord, we've got to always guard our heart. When you come to God of peace and the Lord comes and settles on our heart, then then there's a lots of times or most all of the time we've got to go home and we've got to choose those thoughts of peace because The battleground is right here in our mind. And Satan will fight and he'll try to do everything he can to take you, take that away. But I'm saying tonight when we go home, things that used to get under your crawl or, you know, the little the little burr under the saddle, say, "Lord, I'm going to walk with you. [Music] say try to maybe try to get something maybe your bills will come up and do anything to try no I'm going to walk with God because remember and every one of us I want us to remember this the Holy Spirit is very timid you know that the Bible says Jesus could do no great works in certain cities because of their unbelief one time because there was so much unbelief He had to take one man out of the town so that he could talk to him alone. God only walks, he can only fellowship with spirits that are soft and pliable before him. God's not going to bulldoze his way into our lives. And he don't want you bulldozing your way through life. He wants you to be soft. He wants you to be kind. He wants you to look and say, "God, lead me." He's You're the sheep. And he's that great. He's that great spirit. He's the dove that settles down upon this sheep. It's the anointing that we want. We want that dove resting on us. Amen. And so, as we leave tonight, I'm going to think on those things. whatsoever things are and you can uh uh you can just put that up there sister keys that Philippians 4:8 4:7 let's start with Philippians 4:7 Hallelujah amen God gives us instruction and then we'll leave dismiss here and the peace of God that passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus Finally, my brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of a good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things, these things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of peace shall be with you. So I think that's good instruction for every one of us. I'm going to think on the promises of God. I'm going to believe that which is true. I'm going to believe that which is true about my spouse. I'm going to believe that which is true about the brothers and sisters in the church. I'm going to believe that which is true. I am going to think on these things here. This mind is not made to imagine other stuff. It was made to think on the things of God. Can I hear a great big amen? Hallelujah. God bless you. Amen. We again, we're so thankful for God's God's abundant mercy and grace here in our in our church. And uh we again we appreciate our brother uh Timothy and his family being here with us today. And we ask that God just blesses them.

Another one uh one of the kids almost got hit again the other night and u uh it's listen all it takes is just one time and and then we we'll mourn forever. And u I know we can get a little bit picky when you know and think you know people are picking on our kids. I guess it's normal. But listen, those kids need to be taught. And if they're going to go out and play on the grass, they can go right around. They can go right around this this the the the out building out here and and go play out there on the grass all they want. But and I want you kids to hear, [Music] "Brother Wendle, you're too you're short. You're too short. I Now, my wife's car has has a video camera to to see uh what what's behind her, but my my old black truck don't have cameras. And there may be other people in in our church here that their cameras aren't working on their cars. So, we don't know when you kids are back there. So you all may be playing tag and I'm all for tag, but we got that old that green spot all out there on the other side, but go around this other way.

Can I hear an amen from you kids? Oh boy. Y'all didn't hear a word I said. Can I have an amen from you kids? &gt;&gt; All right. So, so we want we want God's peace to remain on us and we don't want to run over any of our babies. Amen. We want to keep our babies around. And so, and then you teenagers, don't be going fast in our parking lot. Go slow in this parking lot. Be be careful. And uh just make sure that we're all uh we're everyone is all safe. You just never never know because there may be somebody with their parents even just going out ahead of them a little bit going to a car going across the parking lot and if you're not careful you could hit one of those babies. So So let's keep that in mind. Amen. All right. Um we're going to sing this song again and give you an opportunity to give and we just say God richly bless you. We love you. In you I am saved.
