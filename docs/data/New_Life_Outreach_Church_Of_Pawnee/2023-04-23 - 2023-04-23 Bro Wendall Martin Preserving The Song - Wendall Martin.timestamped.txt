[0:01] child when I felt the Savior leading
[0:08] I was drawn to what I could not
[0:12] understand
[0:16] and for the cause of Christ I have spent
[0:21] my days believing
[0:25] that what he'd have me be
[0:28] is who I am
[0:32] but as I've come to see the weaker side
[0:38] of me
[0:41] I realize his grace is what I need

[3:37] days

[44:53] perplexity
[44:54] and the Sea and the waves roaring
[44:57] and men's Hearts failing them for fear
[45:00] for the looking after those things which
[45:01] are coming upon the Earth
[45:03] for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken

[45:37] and a new Earth
[45:39] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[45:41] were passed away and there was no more
[45:43] sea and I John saw the holy city New
[45:46] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[45:48] heaven
[45:49] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[45:51] husband
[45:52] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[45:55] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[45:58] with men
[45:59] and he will dwell with them and they
[46:02] shall be his people and God himself
[46:04] shall be with them and be their God and
[46:07] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[46:11] eyes and there shall be no more death
[46:13] uh neither sorrow nor crying neither
[46:17] shall there be any more pain for the
[46:20] former things are passed away and he
[46:22] that set upon the throne said behold I
[46:24] make all things new
[46:26] and he said unto me right for these
[46:29] words are true and faithful and he said
[46:31] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[46:35] the beginning and the end I will give
[46:37] unto him that is a thirst of the
[46:39] Fountain of Water of Life freely he that
[46:42] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[46:45] I will be his God and he shall be my son
[46:49] can I hear an amen

[47:06] the Moon we've seen the distress of
[47:09] Nations
[47:10] Lord the waves are roaring the tornadoes
[47:14] have been ripping through the land men's
[47:16] hearts are failing them for fear
[47:19] but Lord You've also said when you see
[47:21] these things lift up your head and you

[48:44] Youth and and um discouragement had
[48:47] really set in to Timothy uh into his
[48:50] heart and and the Apostle Paul he I I
[48:54] love the wise uh old Apostle as he as he
[48:57] looks there in second Timothy 1 and 6

[1:03:18] I'm not strong I want your peace in me
[1:03:23] I'm keeping my eyes
[1:03:26] on the goal
[1:03:29] now this is the completion of redemption
[1:03:32] this is the rapturing age
[1:03:34] that will produce a rapturing faith
[1:03:37] and the scripture says there were Romans
[1:03:39] 10 and 17 we all know it so then Faith
[1:03:42] cometh by hearing
[1:03:44] and hearing by the word of God
[1:03:48] can you say Amen
[1:03:49] every age has had to have Messengers
[1:03:53] God says I will do nothing
[1:03:55] amen from way back there in Moses time
[1:04:00] when when the Israel when the fire was
[1:04:02] upon the mountain
[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:05] and the Earth tremble as of the voices
[1:04:08] and the Thundering
[1:04:10] and the people said hey man Moses speak
[1:04:13] to us
[1:04:14] speak not to us lest we die
[1:04:16] God came down and says from henceforth I
[1:04:19] will not speak for you lift the ear like
[1:04:22] this but I'll raise up prophets to you
[1:04:25] and those prophets will come amen and
[1:04:28] declare the word at the time that it was
[1:04:30] to be I'm paraphrasing it but that's
[1:04:32] what he was saying and from then on Amen
[1:04:35] God's always raised up prophets those
[1:04:37] prophets were there to bring the
[1:04:39] Vindication of his word amen there in
[1:04:41] Amos 3 and 8 says three and seven I will
[1:04:44] do nothing except I first reveal it to
[1:04:48] the prophets
[1:04:49] so when God brings in every one of those
[1:04:52] ages when you've seen a messenger come
[1:04:54] on the scene they were under an
[1:04:56] inspiration of the word to preach that
[1:04:59] word to the people to give them a faith
[1:05:02] to overcome that age
[1:05:05] hallelujah amen that's what the
[1:05:07] anointings were all about amen that's
[1:05:10] what the lion anointing was the king of
[1:05:12] the the king of the jungle that was in
[1:05:14] the Apostle Paul's Ministry standing

[1:05:22] departure Grievious wolves shall enter
[1:05:24] in is that right and then there come you
[1:05:27] know the anointing of the sacrificial
[1:05:30] animal going through the Dark Ages amen
[1:05:33] and then there was the Reformation the
[1:05:36] the the the the the the man age where
[1:05:38] men stood up and brought the Bible to us
[1:05:42] hallelujah but I want to tell you we're
[1:05:44] not living under those other anointings
[1:05:46] what are we living under amen can anyone

[1:42:16] one of the sweetest cards
[1:42:18] he had ever got from her
[1:42:24] she wrote me a letter
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:29] came to church all happy bubbly
[1:42:33] all happy
[1:42:35] come in we were worshiping
[1:42:39] and I think I was on the piano I went on
[1:42:41] the piano
[1:42:45] no I think Sean was on the piano I was
[1:42:47] on the base

[1:43:06] he comes back up and says listen I'm
[1:43:08] gonna I'm gonna take her out to this car
[1:43:10] then he comes back in and says listen we
[1:43:12] need to get to pray and something's
[1:43:13] wrong with Rebecca
[1:43:17] I said take her in get her get her to
[1:43:18] the hospital right now
[1:43:21] by the time we got her to the hospital
[1:43:23] she had already lost her bowels
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:27] she gets there and they're working
[1:43:29] frantically trying to save her
[1:43:32] we're all the whole church shows up over
[1:43:34] there in fact we we spend the night
[1:43:37] there at the hospital with Sean
[1:43:41] sleeping there on the floor of the
[1:43:42] waiting room
[1:43:43] go in and check on him on her
[1:43:51] they work feverishly all through the
[1:43:52] night seven o'clock the next morning she
[1:43:54] was gone
[1:43:56] 30 years old gone
[1:44:05] we're looking over the last two weeks
[1:44:07] and we're thinking
[1:44:12] how good God has been
[1:44:16] because she left behind a little
[1:44:18] six-month-old baby
[1:44:21] a little two-year-old they had five kids
[1:44:26] but Sean says God gave me the promise
[1:44:33] the kids are going to be okay
[1:44:39] God gives us those little those little
[1:44:41] nuggets those little things to prepare
[1:44:44] us
[1:44:46] I don't know I'm not trying to make
[1:44:48] something spiritual out of this but I
[1:44:50] think there is something spiritual in
[1:44:51] this service here tonight
[1:44:55] I think the Lord just orchestrated three
[1:44:57] songs
[1:44:59] sermon to say
[1:45:02] we're going home
[1:45:04] Could It Be I'm not saying it is but
[1:45:07] could it
[1:45:09] could it that we're that close to the
[1:45:11] coming of the Lord
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:17] if that's the case then let's make sure
[1:45:20] let's make sure
[1:45:22] go back to the mirror again
[1:45:24] look at your garment make sure it's
[1:45:26] spotless

[1:45:33] say Lord I just want to be ready and if
[1:45:36] you're not ready to meet him
[1:45:39] make it right with him tonight it's just
[1:45:42] as simple as surrendering your heart and

[1:45:51] I'm sorry for my attitudes I'm sorry for
