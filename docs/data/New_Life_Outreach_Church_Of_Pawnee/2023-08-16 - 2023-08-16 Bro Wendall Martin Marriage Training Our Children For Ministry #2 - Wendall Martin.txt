were out of town on vacation and and the youth meeting was just glad to have every one of you back we sure missed you while you were gone praise the Lord amen well and I sure enjoyed that choir too that was awesome he's mad and so if you have your Bibles we'll just look here and and John the 17th chapter and the 21st verse praise the Lord amen how many is glad to be a Christian tonight amen praise the Lord now this is going to sort of be a continuation of last Wednesday night I would encourage everyone that that wasn't here on Wednesday night to go back and on YouTube or however and and listen to last Wednesday night's message amen um I guess some I felt like the the Lord was in it and it was a I feel like there's some things that that we can use every one of us could use some of those principles but especially with our children and um man so we're going to um Minister here this evening on along the same lines training our children for Ministry but I'm wondering if the Lord will help me to to um bring the importance of stopping the generational curses stopping those curses amen so that our children can live free how many believes that we can we can teach our children to live free they don't have to be bound by the things that we have had in our lives amen and so it's it's an incredible thing I uh been Josh and Laurette has been staying with us and and while he's uh working on their house and and uh just watching Loretta and the baby interact together and and and the songs that this that this that that this young and can sing and and oh Howie sings and preaches and plays his guitar and what an opportunity we are giving what a privilege a two-year-old child already knowing the songs already trying to preach he's got to have a Pulpit and he's got to have him a guitar and and I think how blessed we are in this Godless world to raise children sane amen that's what that's our desire is to raise sane children now sometimes you might not think they're so sane amen but but I believe I believe that we're raising sane children praise the Lord amen let's let's go to the Lord in prayer before we read father we're asking that you would be with us here tonight as we Minister your word I ask Lord for the anointing to be with me Lord as I speak and that you would Lord uh just allow me to be a blessing to your people Lord as I just become a microphone to your voice let me say nothing Lord but what you say Lord I want you to use my thoughts and my my words tonight and I ask Lord that you would anoint our ears because you said Lord he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear and I'm asking Lord that you would give us good ears to hear spiritual ears so thankful to see everyone come back from the youth meeting and and Lord such wonderful reports of what you've done for them what you've done Lord for others and we're so excited and so thankful for that the Lord we come to you now and we give ourselves to you in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you let's look here at John 17 and 21. that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee and that they also may be one in US that the world may believe that thou has sent me so now let them be one and and as thou father art in me and I in thee that they may be one in us with the end goal with the end goal that the world I'm talking about raising Ministry I'm talking about raising children for Ministry that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me have I given them that they may be one even as we are one I am them thou and me that they may be perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou Hast loved me now we want to say oh oh God so love Jesus loved them talking about you and me as God loved Jesus God bless you you can be seated here tonight amen father thou Hast loved them I I think we've got to we we've got to come to grips sooner or later that we are loved of God you're never going to be a good Minister as long as you are the one that's needing ministering too and we've got too many people amen that have totally mistaken the body of Christ for amen as as if it is uh just a couple of singers a couple of preachers a couple of musicians and then the rest of us are all entertained no we are a body and we Minister one to another amen so you are loved of God just as much as the sinless body of Jesus Christ was loved by the father amen now that'll make your head spin if you really think about it and if you really believe it it will it will settle your heart forever that I am loved I am luck you see we're all born in this world with a sin with a love deficiency amen we didn't come in this world with uh uh in Perfection amen so when we when we come we've got to understand that we are loved by God we all need to be loved we all want to be loved and I want to say that you were in Christ you are loved at the same time that Christ was loved you were loved when God seen Christ before the foundation of the world you were chosen in him so every time you look at Christ you see yourself and it should be a perfect expression of that Divine love the Apostle Paul amen says they're in Galatians 2 and 20. I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live not the old life but the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me now I want you to look at three things there amen life faith and love amen the life I now live is by the faith of the Son of God Who Loved Me Hallelujah so so service comes from being loved ourselves you cannot give unless you have unless not you have it to give can you say man and God don't want us just living and and we don't want our children just living Amen in a mixed up mindset remember Satan comes to kill to steal and destroy amen but Jesus says I am come that they might have life and that they might have life more abundantly so he doesn't want us just to live Amen in a messed up way he wants us to live in peace Joy happiness amen he wants that within our hearts can you say Amen every one of us listen if everyone in this building God wants you to live a life of contentment he wants you to be happy with what he's made you to be he wants you to be happy with the color of your hair he wants you to be happy with your personality he wants you to be happy with your friends God wants you to be content in him well praise the Lord amen we should have contentment in our homes amen the the now now listen the the environment that the child grows up in plays a major role in the molding of that character with within uh and the personality within that child amen so our our home our family the environment should be soothing it it should be upbeat it should be happy it should be peaceful well praise the Lord even in this even in this society today amen love should be in the home brother Branham says then what type of people ought we to be if if we're a Christian what type of an atmosphere should we live in in a consoling soothing healing atmosphere we should live in with our hearts constantly in prayer and with deep love for every person we come in contact with so so how are we going to give the love unless we have a heart that is soothing that is peaceful that is content amen that that is consoling that is healing you can't love everyone you come in contact with if in your heart it it's in a constant struggle all the time and that's where we as as Christians need to get serious with God and and and and and get a many times we're still needing conversions we're still needing the Holy Ghost to come because amen love joy and peace comes by the Holy Ghost can you say amen that's what that's what he said love joy and peace in the Holy Ghost so so how do we share the these this deep love for everyone you come in contact with now this is a good question how can I share this deep love that brother Branham says that I need to be sharing amen now remember the child is going to mirror you and the way you see things amen hallelujah you're watching a little leaf and just follow his mama around and amen and he's just so content you know and and and she is training him right there training him on the spot you Mamas are training your children praise the Lord now so how are you training them well for your children you enter into Fellowship where where you're where they live amen by expressing deep expressions of love for them amen you share in their Joys you you rejoice in their triumphs you they man you're you're you're you're you're there to cry with them or to help them or to console them you're you're you're there you are God to those people or or to that child you are God you are you are expressing his love to that to your children can you say man the reason why you should never tell your joy you're so stupid oh you're just I just if I tell you all the time why don't you ever learn no no no no no no no no don't plant your don't build a complex in that child amen remember the child comes a blank canvas your children are blank canvases when they come from the cradle and what you allow in your home is what they are going to be now you might be saying well my child is eight years old 10 years older Oh my he may be or she may be a reflection of the turbulence in the home and and we've got to now I'm not saying it we we don't live listen we live in a fast and busy paced world but but but in everything we do we're doing it in the nature of love how do I express that how do I teach my children you can't sit down and teach teach your little child two-year-old child okay amen you got to love people and I want you to know amen you're teaching them diligently when amen did the share of their blocks you're teaching them diligently Amen in in those in in those kinds of things and you when they make a mistake you correct them but you're also loving them you're showing them what can you say man but another way that I feel is is so important is your children are watching you in your brother's Fellowship where they live okay Hallelujah this is outside your box and so now now your children see he's got his toys in his home with and and and and and so it's hard it's hard sometimes to share his space with somebody else but the thing is Here We Stand how do we express that as adults our children see us amen when when you're when you're when your brother gets a new car amen and you're happy over that car you're so excited you're taking on give me a drive in that car amen I'm so proud that you've got that car or or or or or you know when when uh when uh when your friend is promoted on the job amen and and you're excited about you you're excited about this about this uh opportunity amen and you know hallelujah our our fiddle player you know fiddling around with somebody over in in Kansas and then gets engaged well we're all excited with her we're excited for her we're sharing her Joy your children are watching you you're not jealous you're not saying well I don't know you know well they're just flashing that around as if Hey listen Hallelujah if you had something if you was given a uh if you had a brand new car you would be excited about it too and you'd want others to be excited your children will take on Amen your character at the house now this is happening and you don't even realize it praise the Lord but to lots of times if there's a lot of grumbling going on in that house and there's a lot of turmoil going into that house before you know it amen we're going to develop that in our children when they get of age well praise the Lord amen so so brother brother Branham says if you see friends if you don't enter into the fellowship if something in you doesn't cry out for each other if something doesn't project love you know people are not so foolish as they understand whether you're putting on or not they understand it Wildlife understand this amen your children I I say your children understands it and you have to enter into that Fellowship can you say Amen so Ministry I am put here on Earth to give to fulfill somebody else's life I'm here I'm I'm here for a purpose you say well what about me he's going to take care of me if I'm if I'm busy amen 11 everybody else remember you're the member of One body amen the eyes don't ask who's going to take care of me your ears don't ask well who's going to take care of me amen your your hands don't say hey look Neiman I'm all scarred up because of you guys I protected you Mr I and um yeah that's the only reason you're not blind is because I my hand I I stood up for you who's going to take care of me I'm all scarred I'm all no no we're part of a body we get scarred occasionally we get these things but God's given us plenty of blood in a heartbeat for that can you say man to cleanse all of the junk from Us Praise the Lord so you don't have to worry about those kinds of things so long as you are active in the body now if you're not active in the body that God has placed you in and you're setting off to the side then you're going to be longing you're going to be craving you're going to be wanting because you're not actively involved in the body you're a spectator and you want to be oh oh what's wrong with me you've got to be baptized into the body of Christ and then you'll see others as yourself and you'll love others as yourself well praise the Lord now I don't care if you're I don't care what personality you are I don't care if you're the d personality see personality I personality amen the the D or the c or whichever amen whichever one I miss there the E personality I don't care which personality you are amen we are all baptized into the body of Christ some of us are shy some of us are outgoing some of us are you know one one favorite thing all put together the the other you know we we we all come from different backgrounds and we all have different personalities but we are responsible responsible somebody say responsible we are responsible for one another now if you don't show up to church at the time or if you're not if you're not trying to be a friend to somebody else if you're not trying to then you are you you have separated yourself from the body praise the Lord you've got to be a part of the body you will never fulfill this until you do your part in the body of Jesus Christ we all have a part Hallelujah can you say Amen so so that the scripture says they're in Ephesians 4 and 16. from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by every joint by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part listen to this maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love wow now when a child can see that in the parents it becomes it becomes a routine it becomes it becomes a motion something that has set into motion now I must say love is not a teaching love is not a sermon love is nature Hallelujah amen love is nature Love Is God God is love so in order in order to love then you have got to have amen you've you've got to have the Holy Spirit well praise the Lord amen let me let me find that uh uh a couple of scriptures on that praise the Lord you love him amen praise the Lord now I I've said in the past love is an act of your will and it is but you can't will yourself to love you can't make yourself love that's what the world is missing is love so it's not it's not in your will love is God and when we get that New Birth then we only then can we be a minister praise the Lord amen because remember God is love the whole being of God is love he's the source and the Fountain of all love can you say Amen so you can't be fulfilled in yourself outside of loving others God so loved that he gave you say you say now brother Wendell I I I I love or I need love brother window I'm gonna braise up my hand and say I need love brother Wendell I need to feel love brother brother Wendell I I want to feel loved by God I want to feel loved by everybody else amen but I don't feel it I'm missing it brother I know there's something I'm wanting it I'm missing it and I think I think that's the I think the greatest thing for us parents could do amen is to is to address those things in our lives and say I I I I I let me let me just say this you were created for the Need of Love and you were created to be filled with love and you cannot operate when you are low in love Hallelujah brother Harry would you go back there and get and get my little container in those cups amen I'm gonna I'm gonna use an illustration again here tonight amen basically done here the other night but when you when you you've got to have your love tank filled up amen now okay so an anemic person is one that is missing that is low on what iron and when you are low on Iron Man uh uh you you consider you can set it right there amen and and actually you can feel up you can fill up uh two cups maybe I don't know uh yeah fill it up three quarters full praise the Lord now and so you you can go through life you can go through life struggling and you're lethargic and you're tired and you're weak and you don't and and you can you can do it you're still living it's life but it's not Abundant Life and sometimes you've got to go to the doctor find out what's wrong so that he can fill you up with some iron and when you get your iron back then all of a sudden you're oh you're not weak anymore you can think properly you can act properly you can why because you were low on iron well praise the Lord and and tonight I think there's I think there's a great need brother Branham says there's a great need for love in the body of Christ a love now now that anemic person you see complexes come because of the lack of love now if if this if this is representing God who is the source of all love and when he fills you with the Holy Ghost and I didn't get to my scripture over there let me get to the scripture real quick Hallelujah amen let me see here Romans Romans 5 and 5 and hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shared abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us so God's Jesus says I want the church to know that that I that they are loved as much as I am loved all of God dwelt right here keep it up there such Keys all of God dwelt in the body of Jesus Christ amen all of them but he's saying I want you to know that you are loved just as much as I am loved God thinks a lot of me the father has Vindicated me glorified me but he says listen you've got a hope and it doesn't make you ashamed because the love of God is poured into your hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us how do you get love how do you get love the Holy Ghost so when you get the Holy Ghost you don't have to make yourself love has been placed into your heart all the deity that was in Jesus Christ is in you and the love that he expressed on Calvary you can express in your situations now Hallelujah praise the Lord since I want to give you make you the illustration since you didn't know where it came from Hallelujah Now give me some of your love no no faking it right I know what I know no everyone knows when you're faking love give me some love you've got to be honest and say ain't got it I ain't got it but if I come and request it from you and say I need some love I'm gonna put that over your lap yeah that's enough then she has given me of something that she has because of the new birth now she's sitting there right next to her she ain't got it she's got it but because I've got it I can say I'll give you some love then I can give of myself and then she can give love now Hallelujah you want to drink it it's food coloring amen okay so so love we'll come back to that in a minute all right love is is is God Love Is God himself the reason why the reason why complexes have come the scripture says the reason why fear is is uh comes is because of love he said because you're without love he said perfect love cast away all fear you'll do away with anxieties you'll do away with complexes you'll do away with fears if we can simply get well some of you simply get now I say tonight that if you've got the Holy Ghost then you've got love can people can people have love I have the Holy Ghost and still have complexes yeah yeah because they're not letting the Holy Ghost govern their emotions but if you allow the Holy Ghost to govern your emotions emotions will have no part in the in in the the management of your life it'll be centered around Divine love can you say Amen now amen they're they're the scripture you know they're they're in in first Thessalonians 4 and 9 it says but it's touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you or to teach you for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another wow now catch us now holy ghost given up it's not pulse Paul so Paul says I can't teach you this stuff I can't teach you this love this is given by the Holy Ghost let's look at another one Romans 2 and 14. and when for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature of the things contained in the law these having not the law are alone to themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience is also bearing witness let's go down to Romans 13 and 8. oh no man nothing but love one another he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not kill thou shall not steal thus shall not bear false witness thou shall not covet if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love works no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the Fulfillment of the law there's no more law because the law of love is taken over I I want us to catch this tonight and especially you mamas and daddies because as we're training our children and man we want to train them under the law of love mamas if you ain't loving your husbands and husbands if you ain't loving your mamas The Mamas and and you're not expressing that love the way that you should amen then we will We the the the child remember the child is a canvas blank amen as I've been preparing for this and and I I I I've been in there working on Josh's house on a little bit of tile and uh and I as I was as I was there uh Loretta would come over and and and just hearing that baby uh preaching and talking about God and singing and I'm thinking a little little to your and I know this is happening everywhere else this is just this is just something I've noticed here is is the canvas the canvas was empty the canvas the canvas was white and just in two years this child is portraying something when he gets to be five years old what is he going to be portraying when he gets 10 years old what's he going to be portraying come on because they're born with the sin nature yes that child is singing even with a sin nature in him but the influence the influence will take him to a new birth Hallelujah now amen so they'll absorb anything that that you could communicate to them Hallelujah you communicate TVs you communicate a lot of movies before him you put a lot of things in there then they'll be that then then they'll be doing that they'll be doing all of your Disney stuff but because the child has had nothing but gospel put into him there is there is Gospel coming out of it you're training that child until you listen those Childs those children don't need the movies they don't need the games they don't need the latest of this they need Christ in this generation Christ was a servant come on so they absorb they'll absorb what they see what they hear they'll absorb how you respond to others they'll absorb your attitude towards your spouse they'll absorb what you say about others behind closed doors can you say Amen again how how do you act when others are blessed do you just stand back in sort of that little you they see that or do you still oh my goodness can't believe how that is so awesome I'm so glad you're blessed they see that what are you wanting to put on their canvas Hallelujah now you see and of course that scripture Romans 12 and 15 Rejoice with them that do Rejoice weep with them that we first Corinthians 12 and 25 that there be no Schism in the body but that the members should have K the same care for one another whether one member suffer all the members suffer for it with it and one member honored all the members Rejoice with it now you are the body of Christ and members in particular can you say Amen so so your attitudes so amen am I doing all right here tonight your attitudes towards others matters Hallelujah you want to teach your children to respect other children you show the respect to the other children ah you show that respect amen because those children are their friends amen are you negative in your talk about their friends about other people's children are you negative in your communication with them or do you give positive responses well praise the Lord now if I'm wanting to build if I'm wanting to show how to build relationships then I must do it with my own attitudes and my own actions I show them how it is done if you leave this church and you are you're going home on Sunday amen and you're saying oh that so-and-so's kid Hallelujah you have just added another stroke to some to the canvas of that child well praise the Lord y'all y'all might as well say Amen that's right that's right you you are doing that now now they might not express it they might not express it immediately but the more you paint and the more you talk and the more attitudes you have you are creating you yourself not the child not the neighbor not the preacher not the church no one else you are creating what's on that canvas no one's no one no one no one is responsible for what happens to that child and how that canvas is painted except for you you're in authority well I'm preaching here tonight I must walk in Divine love well I thought this was going to be a little bit easier here tonight but that's all right I'll keep on preaching praise the Lord okay what do you mean what do you mean brother what do you mean brother Wendell amen okay let's take a child Hallelujah praise the Lord so this Mama's this child's mama and this child's mama are looking at these and of course this this this this this child's mama can't see hardly anything she does wrong and this child's mama can't see anything she does wrong now at home they see plenty but when it comes to someone else's child messing with their child hmm so so this Mama's child is is that comes and says my Nays she she done it to me again she said I'm fat and and and and she now now the response now that's now we don't know if that's really what happened or if it didn't happen now now this but this is her perception of it so this child is telling her mom and her Mama saying you know what I never did like that girl and I want you to stay away from that girl because that girl should not call you fat although your clothes are getting too big but I can say it she can't well that's that's that's that that doesn't make sense so how am I going to raise a child in a Loveless Society if I don't have the Holy Spirit governing my actions when I am counseling with her her mom should be saying well now are you sure you heard right are you now listen lanae's a good girl now she's growing too as we are all growing yeah uh but I you know I know lanae's a good girl now what we what we should probably do if this continues up we'll go talk to Mom and we'll just we'll just we'll we'll we'll talk it out and uh now no it's not your job to go correct the the other one no you just simply go to the mom and say hey we got a little conflict going on I don't know whether it's a complex I don't know what's going on but but here's the deal you know my girl is now think getting a complex thinking that she is fat because your girl keeps saying that she is fat and and so and then what are you doing you are teaching her how to handle it in love and you are still preserving her hope and her good will toward her friend in the fact that she's still growing and I'm sure if she really understands that she'll understand that maybe she didn't uh you know the the the the way the way she's saying things that's hurting your feelings what does it do you are teaching that child how to overcome well praise the Lord you know uh johnny makes you know Johnny's in gets a failure and uh you know uh Johnny's Johnny's doing something crazy again you know and so yeah uh uh uh what what do you do you see you know when the child comes in and says Ah Johnny he just uh he just well and then and then what are you doing well yes I tell you what we're going to add Johnny to our prayer list tonight when we pray and we're going to start praying for for Johnny every night and because he's still growing in character as we all are growing in character can you say Amen you know what you're doing you are taking you are taking the fiery darts that could prick that heart and do damage to that heart and you're teaching them how to brush it off now if you sit there and and you and you go along with it huh I can't wait I tell you what I want to tell you right now she's she's always I've always known that she is a she's just a bad person and I oh I tell you what but I want to tell you you're a different you're no that girl that boy is going to end up scarred because you're painting pictures that are not accurate according to love well praise the Lord these things that we go through we're teaching our children from the cradle how to be Ministry oriented amen praise the lord well can you say Amen amen child comes out and says well my buddy my buddy done this to me again and and and and and then you can you can turn right back around so the Lord is working something in her hey are there there's two sides to every story maybe should I go talk to the other one and see what they said that you said well no no no most lots of times that's the way it'll be dude let's go talk let's go talk and just see their side of the store no no no it wasn't really that bad it's a it's a it's a it's a it's someone that is looking for sympathy you're either going to sympathize with a fallen nature or you are going to teach them early how to avoid the complexes amen praise the Lord what are you teaching them the Bible says they're in Romans 12 and 21 be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good Romans 12 18 if it is impossible as much as lies in you live peaceably with with all men can you say Amen so what are we doing we are we are we it's a fine delicate balance we are loving by showing them how to overcome but if you go there's no room for wowzy wowzy you wowzy wowzy me there's no wowzy wowzy woo amen there's no victims in the kingdom of God we are Overcomers can you say amen and we equip these young people for that for that day so so so what what you know what do we do you know well the common thing when I was a kid is I don't have any friends you know I tell my mom I ain't I don't have any friends well I've been running around I'm all sweaty because I'm running around with all my buddies amen but but she'd get yes you've got friends get back out there you know amen or she'd put me to work or something if I didn't amen but uh but but you know it it it it's we're we're when we when we come man we we we want to be careful we want to be careful because Satan will get into work he'll work with children just like he does adults and complexes will build as a kid that'll carry on through life amen hallelujah you do not want complexes praise the Lord all right so here we go now what are we going what would what would we do how what are we going to do let's see amen let's say all all of these these boys on the front row here amen these boys on the front row they they well let's just say these three boys all come up to Simeon and say Simeon you were short this is the tall man's club and you're short and you're not you're not allowed and besides short guys are sort of dumb tall guys are sort of smart it's the reason why we're smart and you're dumb now now Simi you're either going to get your feelings heard and you will get your feelings heard that's that's that's human nature right we all get our feelings hurt all right the worst thing that his mother could do would be over there and say well those boys I tell you what you stand that no no no no no what did the prophet say we should do fixing to read the quote but what when you are drawn out of the circle you do what well how is that ever going to happen unless your children experiences being drawn out of the circle now brother Branham says this he says you know what we're going to do or you know uh uh uh uh he said you know what we're going to do we're going to draw draw a little rain and draw you right out of our Circle that's what they told Brother Branham brother Branham says well then I said I'm going to draw another one and draw you right back in I said you can't draw me out because I love you see you just can't do it when you make one Circle God by his grace lets me draw another one and pull you right back again that's right draw them right back again then who becomes the big man [Music] right then he's the big man now you just created a winner you just took a boy who might already have a complex of being little I don't know if you do or not do you amen for this little guy consider saying that's for sure but you've taken a child that that have the potential of scarring and you have taken the word and you have taught him listen you take the high road those guys don't mean that they're they're just picking on you because you can't your feet don't touch the ground on the pews and then you can turn around and love and bring them right back in now if you let this boy sulk up and and go over over in a corner Hallelujah all by himself and you are petting that spirit that is trying to put a complex on him you are damaging your child not the three boys you're damaging the child you are the trainer not the boys how you handle it and that's when you come out and say hey and if you need help that's when you that's when you text Brother Wendell and say hey you got any quotes or scriptures for this one or you got to get a hold of your husband or you you know talk to your wife or whatever and show them reassure that God went through it too and you can show them hey here's what the prophet said can you say Amen can I say something to you it takes healthy parents to raise healthy children it takes healthy parents emotionally thank you buddy psychologically it takes spiritually it takes healthy individuals to look through the Clutter and see the victory that God is is making well praise the Lord amen how are we going to be healthy in our parents in our raising well we know that the devil's fighting just as he's fighting our children he's fighting us too where does he fight us he fights us in our love life amen that's where we have got to stand right there and say no I'm not going to raise another dysfunctional family I I might have came out of a dysfunctional family but I refuse to pass it down to the Next Generation I've got complexes but I am not going to a parent through my complexes I'm going to bring it in line with the holy spirit that love that was poured in me listen this is the way you were raised in your home maybe maybe you got you've got complexes from there but when you're filled with the Holy Ghost now you can love that doesn't take away the memories that doesn't take away the feelings that doesn't take away the emotions of the past you've still got those things in you but you're able to overcome because you've got the love the very love of God oh do you love him amen we must not somebody say we must not pass our complexes to the Next Generation I'm going to tell you right now complex upon complex upon complex as outside there amen if they say the average high school kid is the same equivalent of them of of the psychiatric Wards of the 1950s if the average this is statistic the average teenage kid has amen has the mental problems of what the 1950 psychiatric Wards had it's a curse and preaching on I would think I would think some of you parents would be happy that someone that the Lord lays this on your heart instead of just being a bull about it your spirit is so big and so loud tonight and it's so it's so out there it's your child to teach them how to succeed Holy Spirit puts this on my heart you're fighting the Holy Ghost I started this family thing for what four four weeks ago now five weeks ago started out with these with these things that are coming out amen it started on a Sunday morning when I was preacher when I was studying and before I came at her that one on that disciplined book stood out to me and he's and and I felt the Lord speak to my heart I'm not one that just goes around you know making everyone think that I'm a spiritual genius or giant that I hear from God all the time but I believe God get God anoints me to be a pastor he anoints me for every family in this congregation and he told me it's what good are the promises if the homes aren't disciplined and that's when I came out and said a rapture a Rapture in a lawless generation we've shirked the laws of God I want to tell you this generation that we're raising needs God and if for darn sure better start in that home with your attitude can you say my yes sir no I'm not I'm not a psychologist and I'm not trying to be a psychologist but I will say if you are parenting with complexes it's going to pass down to that next Generation what is wrong with a parent coming and crying out to God and say God get this evil spirit off of me heal my heart give me Grace give me overcoming power so that I can live it before others Hallelujah amen I'm not scared of devils I'm not scared of devils I'm here to set the captives free Devil's have no strongholds or they shouldn't have any stronghold in anyone any of God's children can you say Amen amen you see it takes healthy parents to bring healthy children because your relationship must be aligned with God just uh correctly amen and as you are aligned with God in the right way you love your spouse in the right way you love others in the right way but complexes come in and they block they cut off that love line then you can't love your wife like you should the wife can't love her husband like he should the children can't love their neighbors like they should can you say amen amen yes yes and I want to say this you know uh uh uh I'm not going to hold you too much longer but but you know uh uh uh you know your genetics genetics don't just pass down hair colors and personalities we we share the common physical traits but our attitudes and our and our way that our thinking many times are passed down to that next Generation too and I I want to say Amen that we also share relational and emotional patterns that our chair that our children inherit more than we think amen are you all understanding me so genetics let's look at genetics just for a minute it's the study of how different traits are passed down to the child it helps helps explain uh what makes you unique it helps you to understand why you have your hair color that helps you to understand certain diseases run in your family it helps you to understand these things and and it also helps us with with with with the emotional uh qualities or or the imperfections that might come with it too and if we know I'm boisterous I have to watch what did I teach my boys you're a Martin you're gonna be quick on the trigger it's passed down you guys gotta keep that under control I'm not going to justify myself and I'm not going to justify them he got it from his daddy but this Fallen trait must be governed by love praise the Lord amen hallelujah you love him no parental or the Parents emotional behaviors leave imprints on the child this the statistics say that even an unborn child a pregnant mother's feelings of fear anger and or hope whatever feeling she is is biochemically biochemically Alters The Unborn baby's genes they call it epigenetics now I'm not I'm not here to preach this stuff here but I'm just wanting to say what what the what what what what what the experts who think they know it all he says this change in the genes programs the baby and the way the baby interacts with the world this can affect many future Generations so even and I and I've even known that I've known that you take you take a a woman that is that is that is uh around a lot of anxiety she's anxious herself that baby will cry and cry and cry is because lots of times it was the environment that the baby was conceived in amen drug babies have have the problem a a hard time with grasping is because it was the way that the mama was conceived can you say amen and so so I what I am what I am saying here tonight is the early interactions with your child leaves that deep imprint upon them it affects the way that they process things in this world so your interaction with that baby someone says I'm doing a good job all right Hallelujah [Music] it'll affect the way they process things in their minds it will affect the way they react to trauma the way you the way you're teaching them right now will teach them how to react to trauma stress it will also affect and this is this is what this is what they're saying it affects the way they view others and relationships amen this imprint affects how they deal with future relationships now this is this is pretty incredible stuff what they are learning at an early age in the home will set them on course for Ministry or could set them on course with the rest of the Millennials of wowzy wowzy woo woe is me and then you'll have an entire generation demanding from others thinking that they're old Ministry in this day can still be had and I'm glad that I've got I'm talking to a group of ministers the ministering families here as I say you know all of you parents that are that have bought guitars and putting putting your children learning to play the guitar you've you're investing uh uh I appreciate I appreciate the choir I I I I appreciate you know I I I I used to talk about brother Merle how that they man they drove for an hour and 20 minutes one way every service I'm talking about Wednesday night then they were here for both services on Sunday I went out there to rescue brother Myrtle on the side of the road uh one night because he had a he had a a blowout without a spare and and and there he was out there on the turnpike and there ain't nothing out there on that Turnpike there it is dark Iman he drove that hour and 20 minutes hour and 30 minutes every two times a week for for for years amen but he had a goal in mind that was his children that was his children and on him brother Merle was having to fight complexes he had he had just invested a lot of time 20 years in a church and the pastor's you know when he went you know says you know kicked him out and it says I won't cry when you leave and all of that and and when he come he was hurt and it was in a vulnerable time in those kids life and if you didn't keep your spirit under control and get those wounds healed your children would not be where they are today now Leah was over there Leah was crying herself uh just crying every time she left the church I mean those guys were being so ugly they'd done and and and it took it it took it took some work it took some work for you guys to get your attitudes because you had a Next Generation amen you know I I was talking about the Lancaster is how that you know they bring out they'll bring your children to the to the guitar lessons uh uh uh once a week every week now that's a 40-minute drive over here and and remember bringing them over here for Bible study they make the services every Sunday and Wednesday what what what is what is God doing he's or what's your what's your parents doing they're they're they're they're investing in you you you you you you you you that are that that are are are promoting your your children for for things of that nature and you are you are uh uh you know youth camps are wonderful youth camps are are are are are are wonderful and we're glad but but that's not Ministry that's being ministered unto and we need that but Ministry is is is is pushing your kids into those roles amen or not pushing but preparing them for that can you say man well can you say Amen Hallelujah [Applause] so so how do we do it how what are we doing as as we as we wrap it up here amen how do I do this brother how do I how do I train them according to the disciplined book as brother Branham called it amen well you don't go and you don't go on a rage against somebody that disagrees with you they've got an opinion just like you amen you're looking for ways to find for for reconciliation not not to cut off not to put not not not to put a a a period to the relationship but you're looking for a way to that can you say mine amen you know when your child's facing a difficulty in a relationship how are you teaching them to short up amen you just let them say hey honey there's there's two sides to every story are you sure that you heard right now now how did you handle it now I'm hearing what you said but what what did you say back what what's what's you know honey someone told me the other day that you were picking on little children no no no you know the goose came call the gander the coppod can't call the kettled black you know now listen you children now you guys you guys have got to line it up now with the disciplined book well praise the Lord amen or if it was like my mother this was her one of her wonderful lines it sounds to me like the Lord has given us an opportunity to pray about this situation given us an opportunity the Lord's working something in your life Wendell that's the last thing I wanted to hear that's the last thing I want to hear today the Lord's worked in something in your life amen well we don't do don't do it huh but we're teaching amen I think as I as I was studied along this lines I wanted I want to share this one one other this one other tidbit you should never share your grievances with your children should never hear adult conversations I've got to say that I lived in a in a ministering house my dad was the associate pastor there with brother Burris and there was a lot counseling lots of things going on my dad my dad done most of the counseling I I didn't know I didn't know anything about anything I was friends with some of the biggest troublemakers children in the church Hallelujah I I was I I didn't know I didn't know what all they'd done Mom and Dad talked but anytime mom or dad would want to say something to Mom now you know I wasn't saying that us kids didn't try to put our ear by the door trying to hear what was going on but they didn't speak about situations in the church or in the family or this that and the other with us children present you know why children are to be protected their Spirits should remain free they don't need to know about family problems they don't need to know about church problems they don't need to know what sister so-and-so done to you or brother so and so quit the church or anything else Mom and Dad should always talk about these situations behind closed doors and those children should know nothing about it amen that's right that that's that that's uh you got you're we're back stomping the toes again can I hear an amen we protect our children you don't you've oh oh we want to protect and if we're not careful while we're protecting our little Johnny because uh so-and-so hit him in the head with a rock are you protecting the soul are you keeping the complexes off the spirit man so that he can Thrive and overcome that wound sometimes us parents are wounding our children more than the rock is wound in the head the wound heals here but the heart is here because the way the parents have not handled it by love well glory to God amen that's right if there is a matter you just remember those children are still developing mentally emotionally they're still developing you can choose what you put on that canvas but I tell you tonight I would put nothing but love on that canvas of their heart [Applause] thing no one else has the ability to do it you have that I don't have that ability I'm a preacher and I love these kids the mama on the day of judgment it's going to be you and the way you handle that child and and God's going to look at that picture and say what were you trying to paint I don't see myself in that because what I found out and I gave you a little bit of a little bit of last week I know about pain I know what it is to be made fun of my sister knows what it is we listen you you don't you don't know until you've been through some real real real real real stuff I've been there I've been there and yet I came out of that there's plenty of times dad had to stand because I I fought bitterness I did but I'm so glad Dad refused to take sides with me and in fact he would tell me one time I remember him getting in my face I love you stand up brother Luke I was a teenager like you and I'm over there about like and he gets in my face he said you are no better than the people that are doing it to you because you've become an angry boy wait a minute don't turn this on me I'm turning it on you you're allowing them to make an ugly boy of you I wasn't proud of my daddy but he taught me if you keep it up you're going to scar you're going to scar keep the blood flowing and let God heal it can you say Amen thank you buddy amen when I was when I was growing up or when I was pastoring I had a church split and so I was angry and mad and ready to quit oh I was dad says you'll be coming the man that you hate becoming the man you're just just you're you're no better than this one in your bitter self you cannot help anybody else I was learning at a very early age that it's not about me it's about him Living Through Me and I've also found out that while I have been hurt many times and maybe by some of you folks here I've also found out that I can hurt others that I need forgiveness that I can be a jerk that I can say things wrong that I can get it wrong and when I'm condemned and feeling bad I need somebody that has the love of God that can pour it in and pour it in forgiveness and pour in love I need someone who can reflect that to me are y'all understanding are you kids understanding Hallelujah I mean this big kid understanding Hallelujah she's the pretty kid right there praise the Lord amen so so he that's that's that's where that's where we are amen so we are absolutely somebody say I am absolutely Duty bound to protect their hearts from hard feelings toward others from bitterness from losing trust and Authority I refuse I will bring healing I will show according to scripture how to love the enemy how to how to to love my friend I will stand there and teach them to love and I can say come follow me can you save man amen praise the Lord as the musicians come they I think I think the very worst thing we could do is to use our children as counselors they call this parentification that's that's that's the term that they call it this is this occurs when the parents look to their children for emotional support rather than providing the emotional support so the child becomes the counselor The Confident the problem solver so what it is is it's Mom that's got her that's got her complexes and and and she's and and and she takes her son and and she begins to share her complexes with this son well this boy he's a smart and Brilliant boy but you're a girl or whoever and you're and and you're and and so now you're you're you're you're sharing your wolves and this that and the other with them and it's called parentification and what you are doing you you are making that child your counselor now you don't want to be told that you're wrong so you choose the child you don't want an authority figure that you want him to listen but he has no power and so what you're doing is you is you're talking about this one or you're talking about that one you're talking about your problem and and and and and be it and he becomes the one that everyone begins to to count on and and so but he but but the thing is you're warping that Spirit of that boy or girl because he's still a child amen and the sad thing they grow up with guilt bitter feeling unworthy because he couldn't help untrusting of people neurotic and nervous now they say this is a major thing that that this kind of thing goes on and we we have experienced it here I've we've experienced it firsthand where where an individual just complex after complex and instead of the woman getting a hold of the altar dying out to God and asking God for healing of her heart she would sit there and consult with her Sons until those those poor children didn't know what was right or wrong she she was she she wasn't thinking properly everyone loved her but the way that she was trying to tell and this undeveloped mind was sitting there and just taking it in I can't believe really what did it do well then he couldn't trust anybody in the church he couldn't trust anybody in the church now he says there's no such thing as God [Music] and all the while Mama's saying oh please pray for my son Paul please pray for my sons he said quit talking to your sons you're the parent they're the son quit sharing all of your nonsense with your son he's not meant to carry your load I'll praise the Lord well I can say that I've I've put my I've put my heart into it here tonight and my my thoughts and my prayer into it tonight I don't want fear to be passed down to the Next Generation I don't want complexes to be passed down to the Next Generation I'm here to tell you folks there are some complexes that we all carry that are generational complexes we already carry them because of mom and dad or Grandpa and Grandma those are things that come but I'm here to tell you I believe that if we stand in in with the blood of Jesus Christ and with the word of God and get the Holy Ghost we can overcome all things can you say man amen one author said when we heal ourselves we heal the generation that follows pain is passed through the family line until someone is ready to feel it heal it and Let It Go somebody say I'm ready to feel it heal it and Let It Go hey man because I am not raising in Psychopaths I am raising sons of God that no matter what comes in life they are Overcomers and I say thank God for overcoming power right here sitting on the front lines amen right right here in in New Life praise the Lord what are we going to sing brother Kobe amen I'm
