[46:33] God's greatest dreams and that's the
[46:35] finality of redemption amen the whole
[46:39] reason he made the Earth if you ever

[47:04] God is not interested in those things in
[47:06] our lives I I want to say that God is
[47:09] very much interested in the things that

[47:50] God's a big dreamer God does not dream
[47:52] small God dreams
[47:55] big and if he dreams dreams If he if he
[47:58] dreams big amen then he's interested in
[48:00] your dreams as well amen that that's why
[48:03] that's why the prophet of God Amen would
[48:05] say amen he says don't ever think you
[48:07] could ever ask too much of God I believe
[48:10] the scripture said amen you have not
[48:12] because you ask not and you ask not
[48:14] because you believe not he wants us to
[48:17] ask and believe that our Joys would be

[48:49] faith now no just know exactly how to
[48:52] use it and it'll be all right you can
[48:55] put it to work and it'll be just fine

[49:02] dreams amen and God does not just have
[49:05] dreams but his sons have dreams amen and
[49:10] those dreams are called Faith amen Faith
[49:13] sees things Faith desires things Faith
[49:16] sees things that are not amen those of
[49:19] you that are wanting healing and faith
[49:21] is reaching out and saying I desire that
[49:24] I want that amen I long for that God
[49:28] gave you that faith that desire so that
[49:32] you can possess amen whatever your
[49:35] desire is well that that should make you
[49:37] want to shout amen so I so someone say

[50:26] that thing that goes beyond where you
[50:28] are and it takes its its Mighty Wings
[50:32] and it goes up and sets on that great
[50:35] Rock of Ages and it begins to look out
[50:38] and see things that no one else can see
[50:41] amen and that faith says amen I see
[50:44] healing for me I see my children safe I
[50:48] see Deliverance amen and it stake it
[50:51] Stakes its claim upon the Rock of Ages
[50:55] brother renon would put it this way he
[50:57] says now he says faith take its position
[51:01] on the rock of God's word and all the
[51:03] waves of Hell beating against its
[51:05] foundation it'll take its Eagle Eye and
[51:09] soar Beyond them clouds and it'll see
[51:12] the god of resurrection and of Promise
[51:16] oh how many wants to dream here this
[51:19] morning amen that's exactly right you
[51:22] see God in his dreaming of you he says I
[51:25] I don't believe when we get to heaven
[51:27] that we will uh uh be just everybody
[51:30] look look just exactly alike I don't
[51:32] believe that all will be blondes or
[51:34] brunets or little or big or Giants I I
[51:38] believe that God is a god of variety and
[51:40] the world proves that he's got the big
[51:42] mountains and the little mountains he's
[51:44] got Plains he's got deserts he's got
[51:47] different things because he made it the
[51:49] way he wanted it he made the season
[51:52] summer spring uh uh uh Autumn he winter
[51:56] he made the seasons he he chose it it
[51:59] shows he is a god of variety he made you
[52:03] in a variety so that means not everyone
[52:06] has the same dream not everyone has got
[52:09] to we're not made out of the same mode
[52:11] someone say thank
[52:13] God Amen your desires might be different
[52:16] than your desires but God is big enough
[52:19] to take care of all your
[52:23] desires hallelujah amen can you say amen

[52:38] kinds of people in his kingdom amen like
[52:41] many kinds of hills and like uh uh many
[52:44] kinds of rivers and springs and lakes
[52:46] they they were here when you when you
[52:48] come here first because the kindness of
[52:51] your heavenly father place them here

[1:02:13] relationship he gives a promise amen

[1:03:12] when the Revelation struck that heart
[1:03:14] amen he begin to create the booties and
[1:03:17] begin to create a little room and he
[1:03:19] begin to prepare why because the promise
[1:03:23] created expectation and expectation
[1:03:27] brings about
[1:03:33] preparation and it's the
[1:03:37] preparation that brings the promise to
[1:03:40] pass you see the channel
[1:03:43] now there's there's there's too many
[1:03:46] amen that that that amen they're still
[1:03:50] messing around with a word they have
[1:03:53] never found it's a legalistic word to
[1:03:56] them everything is legalism amen so they
[1:03:59] don't know how to step out in faith and
[1:04:02] they'll always revert back to legalism
[1:04:04] it's got to they've got to have a set
[1:04:06] rule they've got to have a certain
[1:04:08] something and they can never step out in
[1:04:10] faith amen they it's got to be something
[1:04:13] concrete tangible amen that they can
[1:04:15] control that they can keep in their
[1:04:18] grasp faith is a faith is is God's dream
[1:04:22] that is way out in the Yonder Come On
[1:04:26] Hallelujah well praise the Lord amen and
[1:04:29] so to those individuals they read the
[1:04:32] promise but they're not sure of the
[1:04:35] promise and they're always looking for
[1:04:37] the tangible but you see that's not the
[1:04:40] way God works he doesn't work with a
[1:04:42] tangible mind he doesn't work with a
[1:04:44] tangible body he works with your
[1:04:50] faith well praise the Lord amen
[1:04:54] therefore with the promise
