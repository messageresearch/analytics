[19:50] one by one
[19:53] Jesse's Sons stood before the prophet
[20:00] their father knew a king would soon be
[20:05] found
[20:09] each one passed except the last no one
[20:15] thought to call him
[20:18] surely he would never wear a cry
[20:25] but when I see a Shepherd boy God may
[20:33] see a king
[20:36] even though your life seems filled with
[20:41] ordinary things in just a moment he can
[20:47] touch him and everything will change
[20:53] when others see a Shepherd boy God
[21:00] may see a king
[21:04] me
[21:06] one by one
[21:09] problems come and dreams get shattered
[21:16] sometimes it's hard to understand
[21:23] but things like chance and Circumstance
[21:28] they don't really matter
[21:32] a father holds tomorrow
[21:36] in his hands
[21:39] and when others see a Shepherd boy God
[21:46] may see a king
[21:49] even though your life seems filled with
[21:54] ordinary things in just a moment he can
[22:00] touch you
[22:01] and Everything Will Change
[22:05] when others see a Shepherd boy God
[22:11] may see a king
[22:16] well he wasn't the oldest he wasn't the
[22:21] strongest chosen on that day yet the
[22:27] Giants fell and Nations trembled when
[22:31] they stood in his way
[22:35] and when others see a Shepherd boy God
[22:42] may see a king
[22:45] even though your life seems filled with
[22:49] ordinary things in just a moment he can
[22:55] touch him
[22:56] and everything will change when others
[23:02] see a Shepherd boy God
[23:06] God may see
[23:09] a king
[23:11] and when others sing a Shepherd boy God
[23:18] may see a king
[23:21] even know your life seems filled with
[23:26] ordinary things in just a moment he can
[23:31] touch you
[23:33] and everything will change when others
[23:39] see a Shepherd boy God
[23:43] may see a king me

[28:45] appreciates brother Steve Cochran love

[28:59] um man I'll tell you what we've had a
[29:01] lot of birthdays this this last little
[29:04] bit haven't we and uh but that's good
[29:07] amen at least it's not just one of us
[29:09] getting old we're all getting old
[29:11] together amen
[29:13] praise the lord well let's let's look
[29:15] here in in in
[29:17] um Ephesians
[29:20] the um the fifth chapter
[29:24] and um
[29:27] we will start
[29:29] amen
[29:32] how about the 22nd verse
[29:36] my intentions are not to hold you long
[29:38] tonight
[29:40] um
[29:41] just want to give you a these these
[29:44] Sunday nights just give you a little
[29:46] extra
[29:47] uh something to fight the Devil with the
[29:49] rest of the week
[29:50] and um amen we we're all as I was saying
[29:55] this morning we're all fighting devils
[29:57] and um I'm I'm um I'm glad to have
[30:02] Warriors
[30:03] such as yourselves that we're fighting
[30:05] with
[30:06] they're in in Ephesians 5 and 22 wives
[30:10] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[30:13] as unto the Lord
[30:15] for the husband is the head of the wife
[30:17] even as Christ is the head of the church
[30:20] he is the savior of the body
[30:23] therefore as the church is subject unto
[30:25] Christ
[30:26] so let the wives be to their own
[30:28] husbands in everything
[30:31] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[30:34] also loved the church and gave himself
[30:36] for it that he might sanctify it
[30:39] cleanse it with the washing of the word
[30:42] water of the word
[30:44] and that he might present it to himself
[30:46] a glorious church not a defeated Church
[30:48] a glorious church not having spot or
[30:53] wrinkle or any such blemish
[30:55] but that it should be holy
[30:57] uh or any such thing that it should be
[31:01] holy without blemish
[31:02] so are men to love their wives as their
[31:05] own bodies he that loveth his wife loves
[31:08] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[31:11] own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth
[31:15] it even as the Lord the church
[31:18] for we are members of his body of his
[31:21] flesh and of his bones
[31:23] for this call shall a man leave his
[31:25] father and mother
[31:27] shall be joined unto his wife the two
[31:30] shall be one flesh this is a great
[31:33] mystery
[31:34] but I speak concerning
[31:37] Christ and the church so so he's brought
[31:40] this all that for husband and wives but
[31:42] he's wanting to get us to the mystery
[31:44] he's using the natural to portray the
[31:48] spiritual this is a great mystery but I
[31:51] speak concerning Christ
[31:53] and the church let's go to the Lord in
[31:55] prayer father we want to thank you for
[31:58] your love and for Brotherhood for
[32:01] Fellowship
[32:02] and we're just asking Lord that you
[32:04] would
[32:05] you administer to us as we as we set now
[32:09] waiting upon you to speak and just ask
[32:13] Lord that you're anointing would be with
[32:15] every man and woman every boy and girl
[32:19] Lord I just pray that you'll just let us
[32:22] all come into that anointing with you we
[32:25] love you Lord we just ask that you would
[32:28] have your way in Jesus name we pray
[32:31] can the Church Say Amen
[32:34] and amen God bless you you may be seated
[32:38] there in John the 17th chapter
[32:40] amen he's
[32:42] he's talking about Iman
[32:46] um the father sent me into the world
[32:48] even so I sent them into the world for
[32:51] their sakes I sanctify myself
[32:54] and as he's praying to the father
[32:56] he says may they be one
[32:59] as thou father or thou father art in me
[33:02] and I in you that they also may be one
[33:08] in US
[33:09] so now Jesus is talking about the the
[33:12] the Oneness of the father in him it was
[33:16] God creating a body
[33:18] God living inside that body amen it was
[33:22] the fullness of the godhead but then God
[33:25] or Christ is asking that we become part
[33:30] of that godhead he is asking that we
[33:34] that they would be one in US
[33:38] so as I have paid the price of
[33:41] redemption amen this what my body is for
[33:45] now the redeemed may they be one in the
[33:50] father as I the Redeemer am in you now
[33:56] he and he and he wants to make it clear
[33:58] that it's not just for the disciples he
[34:00] says I I don't pray just for for these
[34:03] here alone but for them also that Shall
[34:07] Believe on me through their word and I
[34:10] believe that's talking to you and to me
[34:12] here tonight amen that's what it's for
[34:15] that they all may be one as thou father
[34:20] art in me I am thee they also may be one
[34:25] in us that the world may be May believe
[34:29] amen so then he says again I am them
[34:32] thou and me that they may be perfect in
[34:37] one
[34:38] now this Oneness is again is is not
[34:43] necessarily A man uh uh the the Oneness
[34:47] as uh Nimrod worship where we all uh uh
[34:52] it's a forced worship where we're all
[34:54] thinking the same we're all uh uh
[34:58] looking the same acting the same you
[35:00] know uh we but we are a man but we are
[35:04] one in his bone bone of his bone Spirit
[35:08] of his spirit amen can you say man so
[35:11] it's not important that we must see it
[35:13] all the same way amen it doesn't it's
[35:16] not that we have to have you have to
[35:19] have my Revelation or my Revelation but
[35:22] we need his Revelation and that's what
[35:25] we want amen and and that that he says a
[35:29] body thou has prepared for me now amen
[35:34] it's a living organism amen it's many
[35:37] members one body amen all shapes in all
[35:42] sizes all colors amen different likes
[35:46] different tastes different preferences
[35:49] but one body
[35:51] aren't you glad for that I'm glad that
[35:53] God's even got a five-fold Ministry amen
[35:56] now and not everyone uh happened to
[35:58] preach like an evangelist and not
[36:00] everyone having to to to to be a prophet
[36:02] not everyone having to be a pastor but
[36:05] it's it's it's a it's a United gifts
[36:08] we've got nine spiritual gifts that have
[36:11] been that that have been placed in the
[36:12] body by the Holy Ghost amen many
[36:15] different gifts but now we don't all
[36:18] speak in tongues we don't all prophesy
[36:20] we don't all see Visions we don't all
[36:21] see but we are one with him and we've
[36:27] got our position gathered under one
[36:32] promise one purpose and that is
[36:34] redemption
[36:36] and there is a United desire in every
[36:40] one of us amen and that great desire is
[36:44] to please him
[36:45] and our desire is amen thy will be done
[36:50] on Earth the inner earth as it is in
[36:54] heaven well praise the name of the Lord
[36:56] amen now that's that's the kind of love
[37:00] that God has given us amen that's the
[37:03] desire I I I I I don't I think that we
[37:06] we should I don't think love
[37:10] um love should not be something that
[37:14] um it has got drudgery to it I don't I
[37:17] don't think love should have something
[37:19] should be something that has fear in it
[37:22] now I I don't think my my wife should be
[37:24] fearful of of of me
[37:28] um going to divorce her I don't think
[37:31] that amen if I love my wife I'm going to
[37:35] be true to my wife she's going to be
[37:38] true to me amen and there is there
[37:42] there's going to be a lot of things that
[37:44] she does that I I don't care for there's
[37:47] going to be maybe some things I do that
[37:49] she doesn't care for amen just a few and
[37:52] and then there's then there's going to
[37:54] be plenty of of those things
[37:57] around but love goes beyond all of the
[38:04] uh all of the things that we don't see
[38:07] eye to eye on because I love her and she
[38:11] loves me now if you don't love your girl
[38:15] whatever you uh boys get a you know you
[38:18] get get you a girl amen if you don't
[38:21] love her in that way if that girl has to
[38:24] be manipulated around to to uh to to to
[38:29] the way that that you know that you
[38:31] think things should be all the time man
[38:34] then it's probably not genuine love it's
[38:37] not genuine love love has ha there is
[38:41] there is a bond that I love her for who
[38:45] she is
[38:47] she loves me for and she's got the
[38:49] proper love for me she'll want to be
[38:52] that way I want to please her she wants
[38:54] to please me
[38:56] praise the Lord
[38:58] I I just you know uh uh uh you know some
[39:01] of the circles around his amen you know
[39:04] if you ain't kicking on your wife and
[39:06] beating the door down and or kicking
[39:08] Furniture across the room amen then
[39:11] you're not being a good husband well I'm
[39:13] I'm here to tell you amen if you want to
[39:15] be a good husband you've got to have
[39:18] love towards your wife
[39:21] and and if you want to be a good wife
[39:23] amen you've got to love your husband and
[39:27] if we would appreciate the man he is and
[39:31] bring those qualities out in him he
[39:34] would in turn love you and bring those
[39:37] qualities out in you and it's a great
[39:40] big love affair
[39:42] how much more should it be with you and
[39:46] God
[39:53] 's opportunities to leave you as a Greek
[39:55] spot
[39:58] that God is trying to find ways to
[40:01] you to hell
[40:05] he's looking for a way to punish you
[40:09] Hallelujah
[40:10] I don't say it that way
[40:12] I see God as loving his family
[40:18] I see God as loving his bride with
[40:23] unconditional love
[40:25] and I see a bride that loves her Lord
[40:29] more than anything else in the world
[40:32] such a love affair such such a such a
[40:36] Divine love for this one who has who has
[40:40] called me to be his bride well he's not
[40:43] beating me over the head and telling me
[40:46] well you'd better do it the way that I
[40:48] want to do it amen how many how many
[40:51] believes that
[40:53] you know if you're coming to church and
[40:56] the preacher's having to beat you up and
[40:58] God's words happen to beat you up and
[41:00] these things it could be that your love
[41:03] is not right with God
[41:06] Hallelujah because I guarantee you amen
[41:09] when you love when you love God it's
[41:12] your desire to please him
[41:15] it's your desire to serve him
[41:18] it's your desire to give of yourself to
[41:21] him and you want his glory upon you
[41:27] I I think that's the greatest thing I I
[41:30] you know I I I I believe that God has
[41:33] this in this day that we're living in
[41:35] amen God is Not uh uh we're not a
[41:39] denominational
[41:41] uh uh you know denominational girl but
[41:45] we're a girl that God has pulled us out
[41:47] of the amen of the church system so that
[41:52] he can show his glory to us I believe
[41:55] God sent us a prophet God gave us an
[41:58] open book God done these things so that
[42:01] you would know your position in the
[42:03] kingdom of God
[42:04] I believe the wedding the marriage or
[42:07] the the wedding has taken place with
[42:10] that word that has come and you say I
[42:12] accept I believe the bride is being
[42:15] impregnated with that word in this hour
[42:18] that we're living in in fact we're not
[42:21] just bride but we're his wife amen this
[42:25] is the wife of the Lamb that I am
[42:27] preaching here today can you say amen
[42:30] and as they re in return our love toward
[42:35] him is Lord your desire is my desire if
[42:39] you know that he likes apple pie hey man
[42:42] you're not gonna you're you you're not
[42:44] going to be cooking him blackberry pie
[42:46] you're going to be cooking him apple pie
[42:48] amen if you know that he lacks the you
[42:51] know that that he wants supper done you
[42:53] know at five o'clock when he's when he
[42:55] gets off of work you're not gonna you're
[42:57] not gonna be doing cooking the supper at
[42:59] eight o'clock at night because your
[43:02] desire is to play he's your husband
[43:09] you say now you just went from love to
[43:10] Works no there's always works involved
[43:15] but it comes because of love
[43:21] I'm not I'm not being faithful to my
[43:24] wife because I the man because it's it's
[43:27] required of me to do I'm faithful to my
[43:30] wife because I love
[43:32] a girl
[43:34] well praise the Lord
[43:36] if you're not faith if you're if you're
[43:38] faithful to your wife because well it's
[43:40] the right thing to do that will only
[43:42] hold for so long that will only take
[43:45] place for someone but you've got to
[43:47] stand there with with that love and
[43:51] that's how the two of you become one
[43:55] you become one praise the Lord what can
[43:58] you say Amen so Neiman the common
[44:00] statement of the church world today well
[44:02] I'm just who I am and you'll have to
[44:04] accept me like I am that's not a married
[44:06] woman
[44:09] that's not the Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:12] that is not the Bride of the Bible
[44:17] she is saying not my will but thy will
[44:22] be done
[44:24] she loves him
[44:27] I believe that the Brian should be
[44:30] moving to our destiny amen that destiny
[44:34] that God has called us to I believe that
[44:37] God has given us his word and the mental
[44:40] at the right mental attitude towards any
[44:44] of God's Divine promises will come to
[44:47] pass we'll bring it to pass in our lives
[44:50] amen I believe that brother Branham says
[44:54] now amen just for a little text if I
[44:56] should call it that he says I want to
[44:58] speak for a moment on on two a moment or
[45:01] two on the word of expectation we always
[45:04] get what we expect when people expect
[45:06] anything well then they usually get what
[45:09] you're looking for amen it's the mental
[45:12] attitude that you have remember this and
[45:15] never forget it the right mental
[45:18] attitude
[45:19] towards any promise of God will bring it
[45:22] to pass the right mental attitude
[45:25] towards any promise of God it doesn't
[45:29] take Gifts of healing to heal sick any
[45:31] person in here has the right to meet
[45:34] Satan anywhere if you're a Christian and
[45:38] you can defeat him on any grounds that
[45:41] he that he could stand on can you say
[45:44] Amen so so now here we go we are we are
[45:48] not apart from Christ but we are one
[45:53] with Christ
[45:55] Hallelujah
[45:57] you know imagine when we were first
[45:59] married there was a lot of uh tug and
[46:03] pool amen between my wife and I and you
[46:07] know finding out who was who and what
[46:09] was what and who was boss and who was
[46:12] not and and uh amen that rhymed praise
[46:15] the Lord and and who you know what we
[46:17] had to go and and things of that nature
[46:20] but the more that I've the more that
[46:22] I've you know decided I don't really
[46:25] have to tell her every day that I'm the
[46:26] boss and and and that she doesn't really
[46:29] have to uh let me know that um Iman um
[46:34] that I could be a better boss and and
[46:36] and once we got past all of that and
[46:39] began to to love one another the way
[46:43] that God has man at amount there's no
[46:46] questioning between us there is a love
[46:50] what I have is for her
[46:54] what I have is for her
[46:56] you know if if we could if we could
[46:59] understand that here today
[47:01] that God is not here in a he's not here
[47:04] in a body the body of Jesus Christ amen
[47:08] walking the Earth
[47:10] Jesus came to represent that Eternal
[47:15] Kingdom and that invisible God but he
[47:18] came to let us know that everything that
[47:21] God has he wants you to have it
[47:25] everything that God has
[47:28] he wants you to take it
[47:30] when when when you when my wife got
[47:33] married she took on my name
[47:35] I saved her from that name of butter
[47:39] and gave her Martin
[47:41] just has a ring to it
[47:44] amen now when I when when when when she
[47:48] married me I am now responsible for her
[47:53] she's no longer a butter
[47:55] she's no longer a man doing her own
[47:58] thing she is under my headship she is
[48:01] under my responsibility I am now
[48:05] responsible to provide for my gal
[48:10] I am to provide for her financially I am

[48:27] my joy it is it is it is it is my
[48:31] privilege
[48:32] to provide
[48:34] for my girl
[48:36] but if my girl
[48:38] Hallelujah
[48:39] is constantly questioning me
[48:42] and and saying well I don't know if
[48:44] you're a good provider or not I don't
[48:46] know if you can do this or not I don't
[48:48] know
[48:49] what kind of a relationship would that
[48:51] be
[48:52] come on
[48:56] motion ship
[48:58] between the bride and Christ
[49:00] if she's constantly questioning God's
[49:03] ability to do what he said he would do
[49:06] well I'm preaching here tonight you're
[49:08] just trying to figure out what I'm going
[49:09] to preach on Amen but I'm pretty well
[49:11] laying the foundation right here
[49:13] hallelujah hallelujah if you're
[49:16] constantly questioning if God is able or
[49:22] if God is willing
[49:25] that must become quite a that must just
[49:28] really start ticking him off
[49:31] Hallelujah when you question him and
[49:34] comparing him with your natural things
[49:37] and comparing him with this and
[49:39] comparing him with that you're not to
[49:41] compare your husband with no other man
[49:45] you're gonna believe your husband for
[49:47] who he is
[49:50] Hallelujah and I you know this this kind
[49:53] of thing here that you know well you

[50:06] Roy's Royce and all these kinds of
[50:07] things amen he promised to provide for
[50:11] you
[50:15] and it takes a good woman to just sit
[50:17] there and say I love my man

[50:22] my man what glory to God
[50:25] now now now your man might might

[51:21] he he sees things afar off now they
[51:24] don't always come to pass amen but he
[51:27] sees things afar off and uh Hey man he's
[51:31] he's he's he's he's dreaming he sees
[51:35] things he amen and and and because of
[51:38] that that woman that is with Mr
[51:41] Visionary amen she's going to have quite
[51:44] a ride amen now the woman with Mr
[51:47] command now she's she had she had better
[51:50] learn how to say yes sir
[51:51] amen and miss and and Mr Visionary he's
[51:57] his chances are he's going to have this
[51:59] job for about 10 months and he's going

[52:03] be here and amen he's he's got dreams

[52:09] head in the sky a little bit in the
[52:11] clouds amen but that's the way God made
[52:14] him
[52:15] and then there's Mr steady Hallelujah

[52:20] when he's going to get up you know
[52:22] exactly everyone knows when to call
[52:24] because he's drinking his coffee the

[55:26] most it's most probable that you
[55:31] wouldn't get along with the other two
[55:32] the two kinds of characters you were
[55:34] attracted to that kind of a man for a
[55:37] reason
[55:38] now when we come to Christ you didn't
[55:42] know this is going to turn into a
[55:43] marriage seminar Hallelujah when we've
[55:45] come to Christ
[55:47] we should X
[55:49] them
[55:51] for who he is
[55:54] not flashy
[55:57] Christ is not flashy
[55:59] he's not out there trying with glitter
[56:02] and trying to impress people that's not
[56:05] Christ
[56:08] but Christ has got a love
[56:11] and a stability
[56:14] that if you'll put your confidence in
[56:16] him he'll bring you through every time
[56:21] his words
[56:24] he is Mr command
[56:27] he is one of those guys listen I've
[56:29] given you my word
[56:31] and I'm expecting you to believe me
[56:35] I'm giving you my word I don't want to
[56:38] say it twice so three times or four
[56:39] times just believe what I say
[56:44] praise the Lord
[56:46] amen
[56:47] now our attitude
[56:50] toward Christ and his word
[56:54] it should be of most utmost important
[56:57] you remember
[56:59] you remember Sarah amen and
[57:03] what gave Sarah faith is when she
[57:06] recognized her position
[57:08] when she recognized until that time it
[57:11] was always somebody else
[57:13] Sarah was always saying well it's got to
[57:15] be that one well it's got to be this it
[57:18] can't be me
[57:20] and and God was trying to say listen I'm
[57:24] given the promise to Abraham
[57:27] and to Sarah
[57:28] is that right
[57:30] matter of fact when the angel come he
[57:32] remember brother Branham says well he
[57:34] says I see the angel take his chair
[57:36] maybe and and leans back and you know
[57:39] his back toward the tent and Sarah
[57:41] listening through the tent you know and
[57:43] kind of ear dropping you know and
[57:45] listening through the tent and she was
[57:46] kind of in a awful mood that morning you
[57:50] don't see things when you come to church
[57:52] in that kind of a mood you just there's
[57:55] just no need of trying it you you just
[57:57] might as well have stayed home you won't
[57:59] get nothing out of it anyhow go home
[58:02] when you know when you when you come to
[58:04] church come prayed up come in the
[58:07] atmosphere come expecting Abraham knew
[58:10] that the time of the promise was getting
[58:13] close it had to be he was a hundred
[58:16] years old he was expecting at any time
[58:18] he was watching every minute and when he
[58:21] run in and told Sarah this I believe is
[58:23] our day of visitation she kind of looked
[58:25] at him with those big guys and thought
[58:27] well Abraham you've said that a long
[58:29] time but you know know there will come a
[58:32] time when it will be so if God said so
[58:36] then when the angel took his chair and
[58:38] leaned back and he said Abraham sing
[58:41] that you've got favor with God that you
[58:43] are an heir of the world and you're
[58:45] going to be the father of many nations
[58:46] you believe that since you were 75 years
[58:49] old for 25 years otherwise you've waited
[58:53] for this and promised Child by Sarah now
[58:56] I'm not going to keep this from you and
[58:57] what I'm going to do I'm going to visit

[1:02:34] not look for the church hairdos and new
[1:02:36] dresses let's look for the Holy Spirit
[1:02:40] to come in the Supernatural and raise
[1:02:43] some things the church don't need a
[1:02:45] facelift it needs a birth the Holy Ghost
[1:02:48] to come into the church bring back the

[1:10:27] would say with that creative power of
[1:10:29] the omnipotence of God knowing that he
[1:10:31] promised it he said it in his word he
[1:10:34] creates a power that goes out yonder and
[1:10:36] brings it to pass things that is not it
[1:10:39] makes them as though they are because
[1:10:42] two on magnificence have met
[1:10:45] what is what are these two omnipotence
[1:10:48] what is it's it's this you're made of
[1:10:50] the same stuff
[1:10:52] it's husband and wife

[1:11:15] your sins and now that Eternal part of
[1:11:17] God is made manifest in you
[1:11:20] declaring himself through you

[1:19:32] towards their wives
[1:19:34] you love your wife respect your wife
[1:19:37] give honor to that wife
[1:19:39] is that right
[1:19:40] amen it's quite interesting that the
[1:19:43] Bible says for the man to love his wife
[1:19:46] and it says for the woman to respect her
[1:19:48] husband
[1:19:50] now it's all it's all love
[1:19:53] but but it's it's it's two different
[1:19:55] things why would the reference to your
[1:19:57] husband why respect reverence
[1:20:00] is because he's ordained to lead
[1:20:05] he is to love you provide for you give
[1:20:08] to you
[1:20:09] but his needs are met when he is honored
[1:20:12] respected reverenced
[1:20:17] God gives to us and how we love him
[1:20:21] is to respect his
[1:20:27] amen God you said it and I'm not going
[1:20:30] to question it I believe you Lord
[1:20:33] I believe you're able
[1:20:36] is that right I believe you're able I
[1:20:39] believe you're more than able
[1:20:41] and God says huh I resist the proud
[1:20:44] but I give I give grace to the humble
[1:20:47] but I give a lot of Grace
[1:20:50] to that one that is gratefully humble
[1:20:54] I I give I give abundant grace
[1:20:57] to that one
[1:20:59] who was seeking me and coming in a man
[1:21:03] and loving me I
[1:21:06] want to be
[1:21:08] I want that gal to be next to me can you
[1:21:10] see man amen
[1:21:13] Hallelujah
[1:21:14] so you got me am I making any sense
[1:21:18] I'm making any sense here tonight
[1:21:20] Jesus
[1:21:22] was convinced as as the musicians come
[1:21:26] Jesus was convinced that he would raise
[1:21:29] up on the third day
[1:21:30] he was so convinced
[1:21:34] that he said you destroy this Temple and
[1:21:38] I'll raise it up the third day
[1:21:41] David in the scripture under the
[1:21:43] inspiration of prophet
[1:21:45] David was a prophet you know
[1:21:47] and David under the inspiration
[1:21:50] prophesied and says I will not leave his
[1:21:52] soul in hell
[1:21:54] neither suffer my Holy One to see
[1:21:57] corruption
[1:21:59] he knew that sometime within 72 hours
[1:22:03] before corruption said in that body he
[1:22:06] would raise up
[1:22:08] 72 hours is three days and nights
[1:22:11] so he said destroy it
[1:22:13] I'll raise it up
[1:22:15] fairly convinced that's right
[1:22:19] that he would raise it up again
[1:22:23] he knew the scriptures
[1:22:26] can't fail
[1:22:28] and then brother Branham stands there
[1:22:30] and says I'm convinced
[1:22:33] that he's the same yesterday
[1:22:35] today and forever
[1:22:40] history and the message I'm preaching
[1:22:43] Vince that it's the truth
[1:22:46] vents that these Visions come from God
[1:22:49] I'm convinced we're living in the last
[1:22:52] days I am convinced that this very
[1:22:55] Spirit that's on me now is the Holy
[1:22:59] Ghost I'm thoroughly convinced
[1:23:07] you want to please the Lord you want
[1:23:08] some abundance of Grace you just start
[1:23:10] you just start getting an attitude of
[1:23:12] Thoroughly convinced
[1:23:15] you you get an attitude of I'm convinced
[1:23:23] I'm convinced
[1:23:25] foreign
[1:23:27] he says I'm convinced that the Holy
[1:23:29] Ghost is the right his way is right I'm
[1:23:31] convinced the Bible weighs the truth I'm
[1:23:33] convinced that it is Jesus Christ right
[1:23:36] here now I'm convinced if we believed
[1:23:39] him at this moment I'm convinced that he
[1:23:41] would heal every sick person in a moment
[1:23:43] in a twinkling of an eye I'm convinced
[1:23:46] he would pour out the Holy Ghost upon
[1:23:47] here
[1:23:48] till there would be such a shout till
[1:23:52] hard to tell what would take place I'm
[1:23:54] convinced I believe it with all of my
[1:23:56] heart not because I'm an old man I've
[1:23:59] preached this when I was a kid not over
[1:24:01] 20 years old I'm convinced since the day
[1:24:04] I've been convinced since the day met me
[1:24:06] on the river Hallelujah I'm convinced
[1:24:09] that he's here now I'm convinced and the
[1:24:11] pillar of fire is the same Pillar of
[1:24:13] Fire that was with Israel in the
[1:24:14] wilderness is the same Pillar of Fire
[1:24:16] with the church today Glory I'm
[1:24:18] convinced it's right it I I've gave my
[1:24:21] life for it
[1:24:22] I've left home and everything else again
[1:24:25] get me and give my everything for it I'm
[1:24:28] convinced it's the truth I'm convinced
[1:24:30] he's here now I'm convinced that this
[1:24:32] spirit that is here now is the holy
[1:24:34] spirit I'm convinced we're baptized into
[1:24:36] his Spirit right now I know it's the
[1:24:39] truth I'm fairly convinced that Jesus
[1:24:43] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:24:47] forever I'm convinced perfectly
[1:24:52] convinced
[1:24:56] now he had to be
[1:24:58] he had to be in order to stand up there
[1:25:04] someone asked him they said are you are
[1:25:05] you ever worried that you're going to
[1:25:07] miss it
[1:25:08] he said no not at all
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:15] as long as I'm prepared
[1:25:18] and I'm waiting on him
[1:25:21] and he does the speaking
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:26] he just uses my voice
[1:25:29] he promised me
[1:25:31] that no matter what came my way
[1:25:35] that he would stand right there with me
[1:25:39] I am not afraid
[1:25:43] now that was a prophet
[1:25:45] that I want to say as the bride
[1:25:49] he was a bride member
[1:25:51] he was part of the Bride just as you
[1:25:54] that you have now you might not be a
[1:25:55] prophet
[1:25:57] and take God's word and say he will
[1:25:59] never fail me he'll never fail me
[1:26:03] do you believe that here tonight
[1:26:05] Hallelujah
[1:26:07] oh I love him
[1:26:10] Hallelujah
[1:26:12] man
[1:26:15] I want to arm myself
[1:26:18] I want to stand

[1:26:26] upon God for my expectation is for him
[1:26:30] only as my rock and my salvation
[1:26:33] he is my defense and I shall not be

[1:29:27] discouraged that's when the devil can
[1:29:29] really pour it on you
[1:29:32] when he gets you
[1:29:34] and if you come to church and say well I
[1:29:36] don't know I just don't know whether

[1:30:34] by choice elected us and brought us into

[1:30:53] all
[1:30:54] amen it's the father who takes care of
[1:30:57] it
[1:30:58] has got any more power than God
[1:31:00] so what kind of power have you got
[1:31:03] what kind of a power have you got over
[1:31:05] you to take care of you
[1:31:08] the whole power that created the
[1:31:10] universe
[1:31:12] it took the solar system

[1:31:21] sure he watches over you
[1:31:23] that's the kind of father
[1:31:26] we have
[1:31:32] how much he loves if he sees a little
[1:31:34] sparrow that falls If he if he takes
[1:31:37] care of of the Lily if he does all of
[1:31:40] these things how much more
[1:31:42] does he love his people
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:47] praise the Lord you love him
[1:31:50] now for a body
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:31:52] you can be seated for just a moments
[1:31:53] clearly that that one that one video I
[1:31:55] want you to play you you have that by
[1:31:57] chance
[1:31:59] amen I we I've played this years ago but
[1:32:01] I want to play this for you here this
[1:32:03] morning but we're a part of a body
[1:32:07] and
[1:32:08] you you you're you're not powerful on
[1:32:10] your own
[1:32:13] you're not powerful first thing you want
[1:32:15] to do whenever you're whenever you're
[1:32:17] you're discouraged what do you want to
[1:32:18] do pull away
[1:32:21] can I hear an amen
[1:32:23] you want to go do your own thing pull
[1:32:26] away
[1:32:27] amen why
[1:32:30] because that's that's that's the spirit
[1:32:32] that comes with discouragement
[1:32:34] when you're sick there's spirits that
[1:32:36] come with discouragement how many knows
[1:32:38] that spirits of depression follow
[1:32:39] sickness
[1:32:41] amen there are spirits that come with
[1:32:44] discouragement
[1:32:46] and they attach themselves and they they
[1:32:48] they they they they they they Lord it
[1:32:50] over on you man they they do and they
[1:32:53] want to pull you off
[1:32:55] and and out because you are only
[1:32:57] powerful
[1:33:03] praying for one
[1:33:04] and even with one another I think that's
[1:33:06] the reason why I think that's the reason
[1:33:07] why we should call with one another and
[1:33:10] and especially especially for those I
[1:33:12] you know I I
[1:33:14] I told Brother Harry the other day
[1:33:16] brother Harry and sister Stephanie I
[1:33:17] said you know we we don't tell you all
[1:33:20] the time you guys are way off over in no
[1:33:21] man's land over there in that foreign
[1:33:23] country of Stillwater and uh
[1:33:26] and uh you know but we do think about
[1:33:28] you and we're praying for you the same
[1:33:30] way with you guys I mean you guys are
[1:33:33] you're not out of mind you're out of
[1:33:35] sight but not out of mind
[1:33:37] amen
[1:33:38] and and we love we we love those that
[1:33:43] we love it that when we're all around
[1:33:45] even if we don't talk to each other here
[1:33:47] in Pawnee all the time just knowing that
[1:33:49] we're there with each other just knowing
[1:33:50] that knowing that
[1:33:53] yeah I see brother William you know he
[1:33:55] passes he'll he'll wave at me or I'll
[1:33:57] see somebody and we'll you know and and
[1:33:59] and and there's just that camaraderie or
[1:34:02] however you say it amen
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:05] because there's something about
[1:34:08] there's something about that Unity
[1:34:11] and don't ever no one think don't don't
[1:34:13] ever think that no one loves you because
[1:34:15] sometimes that's Spirit of
[1:34:17] discouragement
[1:34:18] I mean you don't have to you don't have
[1:34:20] to be in in uh
[1:34:23] uh Missouri
[1:34:25] a man to feel like you're all alone you
[1:34:27] could be you could be living at my house
[1:34:29] and feel like you're all alone
[1:34:32] and here amen we've we've almost got the
[1:34:35] entire block conquered amen
[1:34:38] and uh we
[1:34:40] but but we can still be alone we can
[1:34:43] still feel alone
[1:34:45] but that's that's where as a body
[1:34:48] we need one another
[1:34:51] pray for one another amen
[1:34:55] this is an older video but I want I want
[1:34:58] I want to play it amen and go ahead
[1:35:01] sister keys
[1:35:02] praise the Lord
[1:35:08] it is very important for God's chosen
[1:35:11] people not to be left alone in the
[1:35:12] season this video depicts exactly why
[1:35:18] right now the lion is being surrounded
[1:35:21] by a pack of 20 hyenas even though he is
[1:35:25] noted as the king of the jungle their
[1:35:27] goal is to weigh him down so that they
[1:35:29] can easily go in for the kill just as
[1:35:32] the enemy tries to overwhelm us with
[1:35:34] bills attacks on our health finances and
[1:35:37] overall relationships
[1:35:39] too many of us don't understand that
[1:35:41] when we are left alone we're easily
[1:35:44] defeated especially when we have no help
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:15] Gus and his disciples out two by two
[1:36:18] because the power of two of God chosen
[1:36:21] people exceeds the power of 20 demons
[1:36:24] pray for your help because when your
[1:36:26] help shows up the odds change as the
[1:36:29] commentator States the power of two male
[1:36:32] lions could easily defeat the pack of 20
[1:36:34] hyenas years ago I prayed and asked God
[1:36:38] for a prayer partner I needed a warrior
[1:36:40] a Divine connection to fulfill the work
[1:36:43] at hand as life can be very cumbersome I
[1:36:47] commission you even now to pre-impress
[1:36:50] God for your help and for those who are
[1:36:52] blessed with such a bond never allow
[1:36:55] pettiness prior to outside people to
[1:36:57] take away the very thing that's meant to
[1:36:59] keep you alive in the season when God
[1:37:02] has pair two together nothing can defeat
[1:37:05] you
