service Lord you've been filling this with good things Lord you've been placing your word into our hearts and into our lives father we know it's by that word that lives are changed it's by your word that Lord's situations are turned around and tonight father as we come to this service this evening Lord we're asking your mercy and Grace may you may you come into this building may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit or if there be one feeling or one ill thing that may have happened today Lord that would try to interrupt the communication between a young person and the Mighty God lord may you bind that enemy may you bind that Spirit oh God lord May Liberty come into this building father I pray as your Prophet Nehemiah stood there that day and Lord when he opened the Scrolls and he read the word Lord the Bible says that all the people come in one Accord and they said amen Lord I pray tonight that you would take every amen Lord we we believe in that word amen may you take that word and place it into every mouth here tonight Lord the father by that word they can unlock the supernatural they can unlock channels dear God that or maybe there's little secret things

Jesus Christ we do pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God richly bless you this evening if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we'll invite you in your scriptures we want to turn to the Book of Jeremiah the first chapter we've got a few places here tonight in the word we would like to read with you in tonight and while you're turning there we want to say God bless you all this afternoon and sure an honor and a privilege to be here once again and have this opportunity to speak to you tonight and amen I want to before I forget to bring you greetings from our pastor in our church there at home brother Sean Martin and the Saints at Faith Tabernacle Ascend their greetings and I know they're praying for these meetings this weekend and I know brother Kevin weeks I know he was up here playing there he is sister Melissa they drove a van down from the church and so I haven't even got to speak to him or shake their hands other than Pat him on the back as he come up on the platform last night but we sure appreciate them for coming and being here and my wasn't that a powerful word this morning amen wasn't that a powerful word this morning hey man there ought to be a stronger Amen to that word amen our God is not just our God he's our friend amen and we're a friend to him we sure appreciate you brother Andrew and appreciate your labors this morning in the word we want to look here in the book of Jeremiah the first chapter and in the fourth verse of Jeremiah 1. the Bible says then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I form thee in thy belly I knew thee and before thou came this forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations then said I ah Lord God behold I cannot speak for I Am a Child but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth how many could say Lord put your words in my mouth behold I have put my words in thy mouth see I have this day set thee over the Nations and over the kingdoms now notice this to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw down to build and to plant amen I believe we can say the words of a prophet are powerful words they can tear down they can pull down they can root out they can destroy they can throw down but they can also build and they can also plant now I also want to look with you in the Book of Daniel the ninth chapter The Book of Daniel the ninth chapter and we want to look in the first verse those of you that have read the book of Daniel you know that it can very well be called The Book of Revelation in the Old Testament The Book of Daniel is a very powerful book speaking of end time events in Daniel the ninth chapter in the first verse everybody love the Lord in the first year of Darius the son of assurus of the seed of the medes which was made King over the realm of the Chaldeans now in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years were of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem now whatever Daniel was reading was not just a story but it was actually something that moved Daniel because in the very next verse it says and I set my face unto the Lord God so whatever he was reading moved him into desperation I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes now I also want to read one other verse with you in the Book of John the 15th chapter in the 16th verse I know you all will know this verse by heart and I just want to pull something here in John 15 and verse 16. Jesus you're speaking uh we could very well call John 15 the fruit chapter and he's speaking of the True Vine and he comes in the 16th verse and says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and notice this word and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing and to the reading of his word as you can be seated here I want tonight maybe for just a few moments if I could I want to speak to you here on the thought of something that the Lord has just been dealing with my heart very heavily on the last few months and I want to title this tonight ordained to the message by the spirit ordained to the message by the spirit I believe as message ministers that we have been given a commission by the almighty God not by Pastor or by a preacher or by anyone a bishop but I believe we've been given a commission by the almighty God through a Vindicated prophet and I believe that is to preach the people amen into higher Heights and deeper debts amen I I don't believe that God is calling us just to be a surface Christians I don't believe he's calling us just to take up to space on a Pew but I believe that there is a purpose Amen in the reason why we're seeing the things we're seeing we're believing the things we're believing we're hearing the things we're hearing it's because there are deeper depths and there are higher Heights now the prophet of God says it like this he said the word uh must be established in our hearts he said as a minister you must never establish yourself in the heart of the people he said but you've got to establish the word in the heart of the people because it's not the preacher that will overcome the devil anytime anywhere any place but it's the word that will overcome the devil Anytime Anyplace anywhere under any condition the word will defeat the Devil now really what got my heart on this thought is and does God ever change his mind about his word brother Ben comes there and he's in in Jeffersonville and he's actually going to have a service where he's going to ordain men to preach the gospel he's going to ordain Ministry and he says it like this in paragraph 42 he says here comes a brother anybody know our brother Merlin Anthony now some of you may know that name he was a pastor I believe brother Joe would know he was a pastor over in Louisiana years of years their pastoring brother Matt asked the question he says does anybody know him well he's new to me he said oh that's right see he's with the Salvation Army remember he said remember me remember him said oh yes I remember from the Salvation Army that's right I remember him sure I know him now his face didn't look familiar to me but now I know him he said how many knows him to be a man of God the congregation says amen they still believed in saying amen back then amen how many believes that God is working with him raise your hand he said amen will you pray for him amen he said now brother we know that you're coming from a great group of people the Salvation Army there are great people the Salvation Army does a great work out on the street we can say nothing against the Nazarene we can say nothing against the Pentecostal church or the Salvation Army or any of them they are our Brethren but do you see we believe that we are carriers of a great message for this very hour that we're living in we believe that we are are carriers of a great message for this very hour that we're living in you want to do that with us and brother Anthony says amen now what I draw from that is brother Branham was not there to attack and then the Salvation Army for what they were doing he was not there to attack and then the Pentecostals or the nazarenes for what they were doing amen but that was not his purpose upon the Earth amen was not to ordain people to carry a denominational message amen but his purpose upon the Earth was to ordain people who would carry the message of the hour and I'll say it to you like this amen as a young person we can't help what others do we can't help amen what churches they go to we can't help but doctrines they believe amen but I want to drive this home if everything within me tonight amen you were not ordained to denomination you were you were not ordained to the societies of laodicea you you were not ordained to just just an emotion or just a feeling but you was ordained to a message and it was not amen a message of a man it was the message of the king therefore tonight I can say before you was ever even born and come into the Earth amen you was ordained to believe this message you was ordained Amen to hear the voice of the seventh angel I think it's powerful when Jeremiah says before I form thee in my belly amen I knew thee and before thou came us forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee Prophet unto the nation now this word ordained is very powerful it means to give it means to bestow it means to Grant it means to permit it means to ascribe it means to employ it means to devote to consecrate Amen to dedicate to commit to entrust to give over he meant to yield produce so brother Ram says it like this he said before Jeremiah was even brought from his mother's womb amen God said he knew him and he Sanctified him and he ordained him a prophet to the nation see before he ever come from his mother's womb amen he already had a seal of the ordination of God upon his life amen amen before he ever even broke his mother's womb home amen the hand of God was already upon that child and I'm just going to go ahead and say it before you ever broke the womb of your Earthly mother amen God's hand was already upon you amen and it was not in the form of a physical hand amen but it was in the form of a predestinated seat listen amen you cannot outrun the predestination of God Amen you cannot change the predestination of God amen amen family lineages and situations amen cannot change the predestination of almighty God because you were born amid into this world for a specific purpose amen amen now said like this if I have to do the preaching and the amen and it's going to take twice as long to get out of here okay amen so I'll preach you amen will have church okay amen you were born for a specific purpose you you were not born here just to be a sports star you were not born here just to be a model for Hollywood you you were not born here just to walk around this play in the latest fashions amen but you were born for a specific purpose Amen in my Bible said as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God Amen then the purpose you were brought upon the Earth for amen was to be a son and a daughter of the Living God Amen we were not born of blood nor the will of Flesh nor of the will of man amen but we were born of the will of God Amen then God in his sovereignty brought us upon the Earth in this age to be a manifestation of the message of the age that we're living in you say brother Andrew does anybody else have a specific purpose well you can look in the book of Exodus and find that Moses amen was raised up by God he had borne him into the world Amen for that specific purpose and that was Amen to deliver the people that were in bondage amen that could not help themselves amen the prophets that Israel had a specific purpose he said and that was the blood of Israel should be the cleanest bloodstream amen for not for out of that lineage would come to Messiah himself he said Jesus had a specific purpose he said no man can come unto me me except the father draws him first amen it's nothing you can do about it amen Jesus did not come to Calvary he meant to die for a haphazard purpose he did not come to Calvary he meant to die for a haphazard purpose amen he come there and didn't say well maybe someday somebody amen will hear about my death and think what a prophetic death amen and surrender their lives he said but Jesus come for a specific purpose he meant to redeem those who God Amen by foreknowledge elected to come to him listen friends amen you didn't come in this message because your mama was raised in it you didn't come in this message because your daddy was raised in it amen by the hand of sovereignty Amen to the fair knowledge of almighty God Amen through You by a seed Amen in the depths of your soul Amen to believe and to receive the word I tell you what it's time to do it's time to shake that devil off and remind that devil we're not here playing church we are the church we're not here trying to find a purpose we are the purpose amen we are the purpose that why God would send a message in this generation he didn't send it amen to give us more ideas to argue and fuss about but he give us a message Amen to equip a Young Generation to overcome every devil every Spirit ever power ever Temptation ever happened amen this message is not a weak beat down something it's the most powerful thing that has ever hit the face of the Earth this message don't need your education it don't need your ability it don't need your understanding it needs your heart and it needs her polish Amen to say Amen to the word and watch the purpose of power amen release you from the shackles of childhood scars release you from the shackles of condemnation thank you it's a powerful message I think somebody ought to preach it and somebody ought to amenities amen somebody ought to give their heart to it and let this message manifest itself [Applause] oh I love it and then I love to hear the worship of God but can I hear a good old-fashioned amen amen I love your handclaps but can I hear an amen and then there's something about the word amen if the devil hates amen the word amen will unlock the supernatural the amen will unlock the power of God to come into a youth camp on a Friday night and awaken a seed inside of your soul to a realization you're not here by accident you are here for a specific purpose my he comes for a specific purpose and that was to

if we didn't have this message then we might as well look forward to the next Youth Camp amen but because we got this message amen before this service it's dismissed tonight we could be walking in another dimension [Applause] it's changed our Focus we've set our eyes on the North Star and we're headed in that direction God has called you and ordained you by the spirit to this message then the Bible says this then is the message somebody say message if you don't like that word you pick the wrong mean to be in tonight this then is the message we we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all I love that word message it means announcement it means a promise it means the act of promising it means a promise given or to be given it's a promised good or a blessing now how many knows when God sent his message he bypassed amen the scholarly he bypassed the Theologian amen he bypassed he bypassed everybody that they thought would be the announcer of the message and where did he come remember says that well I had to be shepherd He said he bypassed the theologians and come to Shepherds that was on a hillside amen at 10 into sheep and he said the great learned man the king's the potent takes the monarchs but here he comes with the greatest of all the messages amen and what was the message it is Messiah is here now the the message amen that God did not use amen the potentates and the monarchs to announce amen come on Church oh God I feel like preaching he didn't choose him to announce his presence amen but he chose an old Shepherd amen that didn't have no education they didn't have no abilities but they had a voice and they had a heart and they had a spirit that was willing and able to be surrendered to the lordship of Jesus Christ and God knew he could give him that message and they would go say Amen Messiah is here now you say what is this message Messiah is here now amen think about that God passed the somebody's and declared the key message by nobodies and right here in laodicea amen God is bypassing schools he's bypassing seminaries he's bypassing educational programs and he's come right down here into Pony Oklahoma on the third weekend of the month of March and he's speaking his word to you I'm on Church he's not hearing parting unto you a feeling he's not here in party unto you a sensation he is imparted unto you the message and the message is Messiah is here now can we say that together Messiah is here now amen the Messiah is here now my then I Proclaim with everything within me we have a message for this day we have an announcement for this day brother Joel We got a declaration for this day we got a promise for this day we've got a good thing that's been given to the church we have a message for this day we believe that God has given us a message amen see the part of God said people wonder about this message they say well what do you mean when you make this remark the message of this hour what they are getting at amen is God's promise of this hour see that he promised what he would do and we see him scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he would do Amen in the same manner foretold it in the scripture exactly because it's God saying it amen this message is not the voice of a seventh grade educated amen Kentucky hillbilly this message is the words of God come on Church the same God that God in Jeremiah's mouth is the same God that God and William branham's mouth and he was not speaking according to the kingdoms of the world he was living in he was speaking according to the coming Kingdom which was where the Messiah would Rule and Reign Old Church of the Living God don't you see who you are tonight you are the kingdom of the Holy Ghost you are the living dwelling Tabernacle that God has chosen to come into well brother Andrew I don't think I'm much on your eyes or not amen but in God's eyes or something because God bypass people that spending thousands of thousands of thousands of dollars to understand this Bible and we got young people sitting right here tonight amen they can take the scriptures and can tie theologians and Corners amen because it's not an education it's not a family lineage it's a specific purpose amen that the almighty God birthed you in this generation for you say then why are you why why are you throwing amen everything you got at this message because this message is Christ I know people think it's pictures but it's Christ I know they think it's doctrines but it's Christ can I take my Liberty brother Wendell I know they think it's a bunch of artifacts but this message is Christ and the promise that we've not come together Amen to talk about the message amen but we'll come together to get in the message and the message is Christ and he is the word than we are to get into it we are to get beneath it now if you get in the message the message becomes your absolute if you get in the message amen amen if you don't want me to preach don't push back this message is an absolute well brother Andrew it's not the Baptist absolute you're exactly right because we were not ordained to preach Baptist Doctrine we was ordained to carry a message I can't help but the southern baptist is doing amen but this is a bride you're a young person anointed and a clip for this generation and God did not send you into this age and equipped he equipped you with his word with his presence and we got to get into it we got to get beneath it it's the headship to the body now how many knows that God is perfected in threes God is perfected In Praise program said father son Holy Ghost three in one right amen God water pot Spirit three and one amen see God is perfected in priests now how many hear this this evening you have heard the term amen three pulls you've heard that term amen that there are three pools now the message then that we're speaking of has come to the church in three pools the prophet of God says in 1962 is this the sign of the answer he said or is this that he's asking questions he said is this that that third pool he told me three or four years ago see the first pull do you remember what happened I tried to explain it don't do that he said then the second pulley said don't try and I pulled anyhow do you remember and then he said now there's a third pull coming but don't try to explain it see now I approached this tonight I don't know but I feel Duty bound to approach my church to say something and you draw your own conclusion now when a prophet introduces that third pull to you as a Believer he automatically turns to John 14 12 and says the works that I do say you do also remember I'm saying now watch I know the King James says greater amen but you couldn't do nothing greater amen see he was in one person amen so it's more of it then he was in one person amen but he's in the whole church now amen so back then he was in one individual body member manifesting himself amen but now he's in the whole church then more than this you shall do for I go unto my father remember said if this is the third pull then there is a great ministry lying ahead I don't know I can't say I don't know now you say brother Andrew why what brother Branham labor on the points amen that the third pool cannot be impersonated amen because the third pool was the word amen and the word cannot be impersonated you cannot mimic this word amen you cannot put on this word amen you cannot you cannot come on church amen this word has got to be born into you amen by a specific purpose then the product God said the third pool cannot be impersonated because it is the word he said see then the third pool is the place where he promised to meet the believer amen we we do believe the message you're right amen the third pole was the sword in the hand in Sabino Canyon now the proud of God comes in indictment and says may there come forth a Revival of the just and at great power coming among the church just before it's gone it's not hard to pray that because you promised it amen and we're looking Lord for that third poor that we know will do great things for us in our midst amen 1963 why Christ speak God give me courage to take the sword of the word that he put into my hand about 33 years ago and hold it and marched forward to the third pillow it is my prayer amen Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963 of course being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this but God knows it if you'll turn around and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock amen the second pool amen it's the end of the second pool and the third pull is at hand amen a Vindicated Prophet stands upon the Earth amen not now stay with me tonight amen stands upon the Earth and declares to this generation amen that the second pull of my Ministry has come to its end we have now come to that third pull and he uses these words amen the third pool is at hand and amen the third pole is at hand now we can go back in the Bible in Daniel 12 4 and find where the Bible says Thou old Daniel Amen shut up the words amen and syllabus even to the time of the end for many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased we can go from Daniel 12 to Revelation 1 3 and he says blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein amen for the time is at hand amen we can go to the end of revelation 22 and verse 10 and the Bible says this seal not the Saiyans amen of the prophecy of this book amen for the time is at hand I'm on Church of prophets standing on the earth announcing to this generation amen that the second floor amen is now come to attend but there's a third Point listen amen I'm going to preach tonight or I'm going to burst you are not a generation of church members you are not an emotional worked up but your young people you are the generation that has come to the IMAX of seven Aces I'm on charge amen we're not standing at the foot of the pyramid we have climbed to the top we're not standing Amen on the first Corral we've climbed Seven Peaks we have come to the climax of The revelation of the word of God it's time to break out of this whole church entity this whole formal idea amen quit letting denomination Define what the house of God ought to be it shouldn't be a cold formal intellectual Starship stiff-neck place it ought to be a place of Liberty it ought to be a place of authority and the only way it's going to come in the church is by the word for the season of the age you're living in oh somebody shouting the time is at hand the time is at hand the problem that God said they're in the wisdom and the economy of God this Mighty Revelation through faith known to God could not come forth hitherto thus we immediately learn a principle that for Revelation for God of God for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time oh preach preacher think I believe I will the revelation of God can only come at a specific time you know why it's got to be a specific time because there's got to be a specific person upon the Earth that has been born for the specific purpose of the specific Revelation that is being released in the specific time in the history of Israel the revelation of God come to Moses only at a specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people Cried unto God Jesus himself came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead and in this layout of cnh the revelation of God will come in it's due time it will not falter and it will not be premature think on this and take heed to it for we are in the end time today so a prophet stands there young people and announces to you the third poll is at hand he takes you to Daniel 12. he takes you to Revelation 1 3. he takes you to revelation 22 and shows you what's been sealed has now been unsealed come on do you realize what day you're living on oh God I'm going to preach your best you are living on this 60th year amen of the 60 years ago today young people a prophet stood in Jeffersonville and preached the revelation of the Seven Seals and he opened it with the God who was revealed in Simplicity listen we're not here playing Church we're an Enoch bride we're in a translation season we're in a time where it's time to throw down every idea it's time to throw down every tradition it's time to come back to the homeland of the church and the homeland of the church is not a personality it's not a special perfect creature it's the message of the hour I say we ought to lift it up tonight we ought to lift up the message we are to tear every tradition down and lift up the message foreign like this I'm going somewhere but I'm going slow so stay with me we're gonna get there though I feel that the third pool is beginning to move you see Within Me Oh My direct quote that third pull is beginning to move within me he comes and Look Away to Jesus and says so now I'm going to say something to you that I haven't said all along and that is the thing we've looked forward to so long amen the third pull has now been Vindicated it was come 's way but time was at hand he began to feel it moving within him he said but now it's been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is everyone knows that the third pill is properly identified we know where it is so the third pull is here we've come from the third pool is coming we've come from the third promise at hand we have come from I feel the third pool movement I feel it moving within me it's been Vindicated it's properly identified and he now says the third pool is here well listen he's not here tonight so does that mean the third pull is not here amen I tell you what that is that's a doctrine of devils that has tried to you young people to believe that you got to sit back and wait on something to come I propose to you that your Revival is not coming your Revival is here it's time to shake out of the layout to see it amen sleepy condition of lukewarm formal ideas and realize whatever was in a prophet is in the bride whatever he felt moving I feel it moving here tonight whatever he felt influencing his sermons I feel an influence in mind the third poll is here he said see it's so sacred that I mustn't say much about it he said now watch that third pull amen it will be to the absolutely total lost he said but it will be for the bride and the church now we've come from the third pool is coming I pray this is okay we've come from the third pull is coming the third pull is here the third pull is moving within me amen now he says we know what the third pulley is it's to the total loss amen but it is for the bride there is no more doubt in my mind I know what that third pool is and I know what it does he said the third pool has confirmed the first rule then one time he said about it he said there would come by this one way then it would come by knowing the heart amen but then the spoken word do you see who you are young people you are not a generation of feelings you are not a generation of superstition you are a generation that has come back under the Spoken Word by the voice of the seventh angel we all know oh that's the identification we know what the third pool is he said the third poll is that great and final pull he said see when the day the messenger starts on to declare his message amen the first pool was healing the second pool was prophesied and the third poor amen is the opening of the word it's the Mysteries revealed and there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets and the only one that can have Vindicated his word and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that has been sealed in the word come on Church you are not looking at a book of symbols amen if you are from under this message Revelation is a book of symbols to you if you're out from under the teaching this seventh angel amen it's all about you it's all about your doctrines remember if you'll come beneath the spirit if you'll come beneath the word it'll go from a symbol to a revelation it'll go from a question to An Answer it'll go from a confusion to an understanding I say oh God release the anoint to the Holy Ghost to bring a young person under the authority of the message of the hour or the per living in now he said it very plainly it's to reveal is to unseal the third pull is the message well I feel like shouting on that Thomas the third pool is the message you say brother Andrew what is the third pull it's the message what is the message it's the third pool what is the third pool is the opening of the word it's creation by the spoken word it's creation power it's preaching the total loss but come on Church you're not the total loss tonight and you're not Hattie rights but you're the little faith woman you're the elect lady and you're in position tonight to receive the spoken word some people say well we ought to be casual about this message well I thank God he didn't send us a casual prophet somebody told me not long ago then we need to put the gloves on and preach this message to young people I said no we need to take the gloves off and preach it to him I got my mind on this message it's that third pull it's the one I must be loyal to and it's the one I must be reverent to it's the one that's a sacred poor it's a loyal poor it's a reverent poor you say then what is it it's the message the word in the church making you the bride if he is not Elie so you're not Rebecca and you're not on your way to see Isaac but if he is Eli Easter then you are Rebecca and the next thing is to see Isaac [Applause] come on church amen if he's not Malachi 4 then we're headed for tribulation if this is not Luke 17 30 then we're still stuck in the tombs of denomination but I propose to you that this is Luke 17 30. this is Malachi poor this is revelation 10. this is revelation 5. this is revelation 17. this is the call of Revelation 18. oh come on young people rise and shine your pool is here I feel it moving I feel it breathing I feel it pulsating I feel the charge of the spoken word coming in the church give way to the name of Jesus give way to the authority of the message of the hour [Applause] it's the word in the church it's the church becoming the bride it's the young person becoming the overcomer if this message is not the truth then you're not the Invincible Army if this message is not for truth then you're not more than a conqueror if this message is not the truth you're not an overcomer foreign but it is the truth [Applause] this air Heavenly Father we are gratefully said to see the Risen Messiah 1900 years of all kinds of Theology and movements but still in the darkness of all of it you promised you would appear here in the last days in the day that shot him and you would make yourself known to the children of Abraham but called the elected and here you are tonight here you are tonight after 1900 years you're just as much alive tonight as you was when you talked to the woman at the whale it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride are you seeing at church amen it was in the flesh of his son but now it's in the flesh of his bride see it's God manifested in flesh for the bride and the husband is the same self-flesh these two are one and the church is becoming the bride by believing the word so that the word in the church becomes the same amen the word and the church making it to bride it's the last sign it is God identifying himself his word in his church if I could oh God I wish I was a preacher right now if there was some way I Could Break Your Eyes Open to see amen that your flesh is becoming the word and this word is becoming your flesh if you could see that it's not a Bible story if you could see that it's not a history lesson if you could see that it's not a Doctrine if you could say it's not a church you attend it's the person of Jesus Christ coming into his church by the side of this Resurrection I'm going to go ahead and say it my God is not dead He's Alive my God is not in the Tomb in Jerusalem and neither is he in a tomb and Jeffersonville but my God is alive and well and I feel him moving I feel him breathing I feel him heal and I feel him saving not a god of History he's a presidentiality I think we ought to shouted in the back he's alive I think we ought to shout in the middle he's alive I think we ought to shout it in the front he's alive [Applause] he's not dead He's Alive the third pull has resurrected him in the flesh of the Bride [Applause] let somebody say hallelujah but somebody say thank you Jesus well somebody said amen I'm always going to say Amen you're going to open your mouth amen hallelujah praise God holy holy Worthy is a lamb I say we ought to give ourselves to this message we ought to self away from the things of the world and sail into Heavenly places come on young people you're tired of living off the bottom get in this message you're tired of living just barely getting by get in this message it's Christ well somebody Praise Him I'll tell you one thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna blow that no praise and God devil back to hell where he come from I think it's time to praise him I don't think we got so revelated that we can't praise God no more but I think it's time to praise him I think it's time to break out of these whole cold formal spirits and his crap around this message and tried to reduce it down to a bunch of Divisions this message is not the division it's a Unity it's a Unity of Faith it's a Unity of power it's a unity of love it's a Unity of the Mighty God I'm gonna put my foot on every inch of my inheritance I'm not leaving here without what God sent me here to get [Applause] he's alive after 1900 years [Applause] 1900 years and he's just as Alive Tonight in this building sister jamai he's just alive at your Pew as he was with the woman at the well foreign Delaney he's not a million miles away he's right here come on Jordan you ain't gotta look for him in the future this message has brought him in the church without this message he's not here but this message was the vehicle to bring Jesus from Heaven into the church by the infallible proofs of his resurrection I say somebody lay out the welcome mat I say somebody lay out the welcome at let's welcome the God of this message into the heart of the Bride of the Jesus Christ [Applause] amen [Applause] amen amen this message is the truth the umbrella was a profit Jesus Christ is alive the third pool is here we've been saved we've been healed we've been redeemed we've been filled with the Holy Ghost we've been delivered from sin we've been delivered from Habits we've been delivered from tradition I say amen amen amen amen it's the truth it's the truth [Applause] God I feel like speaking into it's the truth here tonight this is not a fairy tale this is not a fiction story this is a living reality [Applause] Messiah is here Messiah is here now you say brother Andrew what are you saying I'm saying it's the greatest message of all time I propose to you that this message will deliver you from whatever you're under now we might as well preach education won't do it psychology won't do it a change of the way you think won't do it but a good old burning bush experience now foreign of a Vindicated Prophet has declared he's here now if you look with me in the message for a minute you'll see that in 1961 Bob comes and preaches a sermon called Daniel 70 weeks in those sermons he'll say it like this he says the first part I want to preach to you on is Gabriel's instructions to Daniel he said then the next thing is I want to speak to him the six-fold purpose of Gable's visit to Daniel he said then I want to I want to climax it with the 70th week of Daniel now when he opens just if I can take some Liberty here and lay this in here when he opens this he says now we're speaking on Daniel in captivity and Gabriel flying in to instruct him about the future while Daniel was in prayer Gabriel the Angels come in to instruct him he said like this he said I've been visiting around and he said the other day he said I've been to the libraries in Kentucky I read the ancient books I've done all I can do he said but I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ to reveal it to me he says I don't want it to say I know this and I know that he said he knows my heart he's listening to me but I want it that I might Enlighten his people therefore I believe he will give it to me so he was asking for the Revelation to Enlighten the people now he said my wife said the other day how do you expect our people which are poor people many of them uneducated like we are to understand such as that I said God will give the answer no matter how complicated it is God can break it down and make it simple for we are the portion of those people who are longing and praying for that day in that hour and our eyes are set towards heaven and we're watching for his coming see we are watching for his coming now it's a it's astounding brother says it like this he says Daniel was about 12 or 14 years old when he went into captivity how many how many 12 year old what's that what's the age limit on this camp 12 how many 12 year olds have we got here we got 12 year 12 year old raise your hand real high 12 years old okay how many 14 year olds have we got here okay the age that you 12 and 14 year olds are is about the age program said Daniel was as a young man when he went into captivity but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of a king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself Brotherhood said Daniel was a prophet he said now the words of God the Bible was invested to Daniel brother the words of God the Bible was invested to Daniel he said to manifest to the people that God still lived testing well it's still working the words of God from the Bible was invested into Daniel to prove to the people that God still lived and Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile his investment see now if you start studying Daniel's day you will find that Daniel's day parallels our day it was a day of confusion because Daniel was in Babylon and Babylon means confusion so both Daniel's day and your day is a day of confusion now the prophet said what would you give in exchange in this day of confusion this day when people don't know what to do which a way to go but the Bible said these days would come there would be a famine in the land or for bread nor water but for hearing the true word of God and the people would go from east to west from north to south seeking to hear the true word of God and here we are privileged tonight to see the message of God the angel of God they are they are running to and fro trying to find what you're in the presence of come on Church they're spending millions of dollars of programs to try to entertain young people and it's not going to help because the wicked are they going to come more wicked the church is going to come more churchy but the prophet said the saints of God will come closer to God then the way you come closer to God is through the revelation of his word we are living in a day of confusion now I love this because when God brings an end to things he forewarns when an end if something is coming he forewarns you the end is at hand he does not allow you to abruptly hit the end and then say oh man I forgot to tell you amen we're at the end but he sins amen different ways for you as a Believer to Mark the time of the age you're living in you know what he sins he sends angels come on in the days of Lord he sent angels to Abraham he said Angels Amen in the days of Noah he sent Revelation amen he sends Messengers amen but here's what I want to show you in the days of Daniel he did it by books in the days of Daniel he warned a 12 and a four or a 14 year old boy Daniel the end of all things is at hand and he didn't do it by just an angel he didn't just do it by messenger but he did it by a book now can you give me Daniel 9 and verse 1. y'all ain't gonna sleep on me yet have you well let's preach in the first year of Darius the son of a source of the seed of the medes which was the king over the realm of Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel was confused by the books in the number of the years where of the word the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem is that what's your Bible reads I Daniel was too young to understand by the books the number of the years where the word of the Lord came say what's your Bible I Daniel realized it's too deep for me to understand my books the number but my Bible says I Daniel understood by the books I understood by the books the number of the years wherever the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in Jerusalem and the desolation of Jerusalem you know what that word understand means it means discern it means to mark it means to realize brother brother Andrew can I borrow it from this morning you're the most Discerning body of people on the face of the Earth come on Church you're the most Discerning people by the word now listen and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek my prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes So Daniel knew that time by the books and as he read the books he didn't lay him aside but he was moved into desperation by the books he was reading now I want to I want to break this down for you if that's okay I Daniel want you to know this remember I said I want you to notice how Daniel yet an alien yet ousted from his people ousted from his church without a church without any church to go to without any hymns to be saying but what he's saying itself in the midst of all of this Thomas he still held on to what the prophet said laughs testing you mean to tell me you got probably 10 youth camps a year you got free services a week you gotta oh God you've got 1100 books and Page you've got preachers and Pastors in advance us come on you got youth leaders you got used meetings you got prayer groups you got youth nights you got you chats youth friends come on and some of you can't make it from one Camp to another I say it's time to end that cycle I say it's time to break that cycle I say it's time if a 12 or a 14 year old boy can live in a Babylonian captivity under the rule and the reign of heathens and still hold on to what a prophet said regardless of his friends regardless of the atmosphere I think it's time this bride ought to reach beyond the feelings [Applause] thank you [Applause] I Daniel understood by the books now it may get tied here so put your seat belt on but we'll get through it if Daniel the Prophet of the Lord could consult Jeremiah's books and bring him to such a place even Israel coming out all of them alive was coming out of Babylon to go back to the Homeland what caused him to fast with sackcoff and Ashes how much more on it to do the church Living God to know that time is fading out and shall be no more and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the great Millennium is ready to set in now unexpected turbulence okay how can we spend wasteless time gambling foreign holes on Sunday no time for the Lord just run down and if the pastor speaks something or another you don't like it get up and go out if the church holds too long well you're dissatisfied amen look at our condition look what we're doing and compare our lives with the prophet one man in a complete Kingdom with no church to go to it was torn down burned down his City his people was kept in 68 years he had two years left and he was still holding on to the words of the prophet all right swimming holes on Sunday well we're here we might as well preach whatever happened to being loyal to the house of God well brother Andrew they're just teenagers well teenagers grow up to be husbands and mothers and fathers come on Church get married don't change it it just gives you more opportunity to do what you always done if you always miss church now you got two people missing church if you always had a television in your home now you got four eyes watching that television well it feels good to preach in the house of God what's wrong with us I'll tell you what's wrong is we've let laodicea amen reduce our limits and reduce our faith down for well we're just a bunch of ill relevant people they've been reading out of old books and old tapes and following some man that was dead years ago that's a lie from the pits of hell you are a Rapture generation get up out of Hollywood get out of sports listen I'll take a short of that devil and won't think twice about it if you miss the house of God for sports I say shame on you if you put more effort into practices and ain't heard a tape in 10 weeks I say shame on you I say we ought to tear down that tradition we ought to tear down that Idol and bring the house of God back thank you oh you know I'm telling the truth amen when in the name of God did makeup come back in the church well glory to God and then all them gay all them naysayers about youth camps can't they say about this can they when that when did split dresses come back in the house of God come on church when did boys wearing shorts well they're just 10 years old amen last time I checked the 20 year old boy ain't a 10 year old boy fashion become the standard of the message well I'm not going to wear that because I'm not going to look like old sister so-and-so well she just dresses out of fashion I'll tell you what she's got she's got morals you'll never know about there's no excuse well I'll tell you one thing brother Andrew I'm just a little bit sick of all them boys ain't been thinking I'm on the wrong team we'll quit dressing like you're on the wrong team and we won't wonder what team you're on foreign we got boys taking pictures like girls and girls taking pictures like boys when oh God have mercy when in the name of God did grown boys start hugging up on each other to take a picture it's the spirit of the age it's a perverted spirit and there's no room in the house of God for a spirit of perversion we are not to bow our knee to the idols of laodicea to the idols of Hollywood to the Fashions of society we are a Sanctified set aside Holy Ghost Field sanctified people by the word of God we ought to live like the message we ought to dress like the message we ought to conduct ourselves like the message we ought to kick the televisions out and bring the tapes back in we ought to clear the calendar and make room for church again we need a change we need a change [Applause] well brother Andrew you don't know you don't know no I do know it's a devil and it's crept its way in and it's daring any man of God to say anything about it well I'm not Ahab foreign William Branham and if he said it I've got the Gus to say it and you ought to have the guts to amen it [Applause] breaks the cycle we're here for a specific purpose your purpose is not Sports come on church you can make a field goal a touchdown a home run and it won't take you to heaven but you can get under this message and you can slay the life you can Tear Down the Walls of Jericho [Music] you said with Andrew back up I can't brother Manuel I'm ordained by the spirit to a message I gotta say it I gotta cry loud the Lord's word is in my mouth [Applause] now before Daniel goes into captivity can I have a few more minutes foreign Daniel goes into captivity the Bible says in Jeremiah the 25th chapter said let's turn over and read what Jeremiah had to say Jeremiah 25 8 therefore thus saith Lord of hosts because you've not heard my words Behold I will send and take all the families of the north saith the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them astonishment in his hissing and Perpetual desolation moreover I will take from them the voice of Mirth and the voice of gladness and the voice of the Mad groom and the voice of the bride and they'll send the milestones and the light of the candle and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years Daniel at 12 or 14 year old boy read Jeremiah's message and it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished then I will punish the king of Babylon and that Nation saith the Lord for their will make it Perpetual desolation and I will bring up that land I will bring upon that land oh my foreign I will bring up on that land all my words which I pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations for Many Nations and great Kings Shall Serve them also and I will recompense them according their deeds and according to works of their own hands so brother baby said like this he said when God sent Jeremiah was a true message he said there's always a false prophet to arise on the scene to take the attention off of the truth and put it on the false he said but look when Gabriel appeared to reveal not only what he was talking about but to tell him all the way down what was determined for the Jewish race all the way to the consummation God help me Daniel was not reading about a partial future when he read the words of Jeremiah he was reading about it all the way to the consummation he was reading about the Captivity he was reading about the means of Persians he was reading about everything up to the consummation and notice this all the way the consummation listen he asked a little bit and got the whole thing help he asked for a little bit Colby but he got the whole thing come on young people you didn't just get a handful you got the whole thing when a prophet announced the third pull is here you didn't just get half of the book you didn't just get half of the story you got the whole thing you got surpassed you got the present you got the future you got the Millennium you got the Rapture you got some Resurrection you got some tribulation you've got the revelation of everything get under it you got the whole word oh God you got the whole word you know why because Daniel come to an understanding by the books now I want to say it to you like this in the days of Sodom they got the time marked by angels they excuse me days of Noah they got the time Mark by revelation base of Daniel he got the time marked by books days of Jordan he gets the Angels The Messengers The Revelation and the books is this okay you get it all in other words you're not here ill prepared for the age you're living in whatever happens tomorrow should not be taken you by surprise you've been ordained to a message come on Church you say mother what about the future I know the future can I tell you that I know the future you say preacher you know the future I do you're going to overcome and the devil's going to be defeated [Applause] you know how I know the future I've been given some books and some books if there ever was a time that we ought to be setting ourselves in order to pray it's now for we are his true servants and we see by the letters of the Apostles we see by the warnings of the holy spirit that we're in the last day come on young people this may be your last Youth Camp thank you that shouldn't be a crying point it ought to be a shouting point this may be your last Youth Camp what about Louisiana this may be your last Youth Camp well brother Andrew we got Ohio listen you just ain't got Louisiana coming you just ain't got no high coming you got the Millennium coming you got the Rapture coming you got a body change coming you got a victory day coming you got a challenge Hallelujah they coming come on church it's time to get your head up out of Fox News it's time to get your head out of Education Gracie get your head in this message it'll take you through every dark day it'll take you through every tribulation come on church I know where sodom's headed but I know where this rides are going [Applause] Andrew what are you saying can I just go ahead and say it I understand there will come scoffers in the last days I understand they'll be Nation against nations in the last days there'll be tidal waves in the last days there'll be fearful sights in the heavens they'll be organization denominations women will Bob off the hair in the last days they'll wear short clothes and walk with high-heeled shoes taken as they go in the last days the morale will be very low in the last days but Brother Joseph I understand that there'll be a voice come in the last days that'll be crying out of the Wilderness calling the people back to the original message [Applause] come on back come on back come on back to the faith come on back to the power come on back to the Revelation come on Church [Applause] I understand by books books oh modern events are made clear by the prophecy things that are to be the rapture the future home come on church and I'm just going to preacher for a second but it's okay you know what I think it's time to do I think it's time to lose the shame of these books I think it's time to lose the shame of quoting the prophet of God if Daniel could overcome and escape the desolation of Jerusalem by the books of the words of Jeremiah I think it's time young people we ought to quit worrying about well if I tell somebody what I believe well they may think I'm a little crazy listen they're gonna think you're crazy either way so you might as well go ahead and give them a chance to escape the Desolation and it's coming Upon This Nation but Andrew what are you saying you've been ordained to a message young man you've been ordained to a message hang ladies get beneath it now Andrew what are you saying I'm saying Daniel had Jeremiah's prophecy living on the inside of him Daniel was ordained to a message the message and I'm gonna I'm gonna drive this home I got five minutes the message needs your flesh don't need your talent don't need your abilities it needs your flesh now well Andrew what are you saying I'm saying that through human instrumentality a believer comes in contact with his maker so we get so soured down with theology so we don't know nothing about the spirit he said I hope you love me after this but that's what it is I mean Pentecost 2. that's right he said just shouting and dancing around doesn't mean you know anything about the spirit it's personal contact it's face to face that's what you need that's the kind of church God's fixing to raise up [Music] young people if that Revelation strikes your heart limb you'll you'll outrun the horses of Elijah you're a generation that has come face to face with personal contact with God now without a prophet there's no way to come face to face but if you come face to face he says now the word come the prophet and now now can I can I dramatize this to you John has got to introduce Jesus right Jesus has got to be baptized of John so John is in the river of Jordan baptizing people and here comes the Lord walking to him and says I have need to be baptized of you and John says me me no no Lord no no no no Lord you don't understand see I'm just a young person see no Lord you don't understand do you realize the family that that I come out of Lord you you better go find somebody else to do this because you don't realize you you're talking to the Gracie guy that comes in out of the Wilderness and had a bath in six months I hope pray them dorms can't testify to that Lord you you don't understand Lord I'm the I'm the I'm the I'm the wrong one boy you better go find somebody better than me to believe this message but John I ordained you when you were born on the Earth you were born for a specific purpose and your purpose was to forerun the coming word your purpose was oh God hear me your purpose was to wash the sacrifice before it is presented John do you know who you are you are in the word program said Oh my he said the word come to the prophet in the dispensation of Grace the word stood face to face with John in the dispensation of Grace and said I have need of you to baptize me lord I can't do it but John you was ordained Lord I'm enabled but John he was ordained no Lord listen to me listen Lord you don't understand listen my family my situations but you was ordained are you hearing me young people it's dispensation of Grace and can I tell you what the prophet of God said he said it like this he said it's like a man the other day that got in trouble and was going up for the firing squad and he said the friend ran out and found Abraham Lincoln and said Abraham Mr President call him Abraham remember said President Lincoln right approach he said my friends getting ready to be killed in the morning by firing squad would you sign a pardon said he reached over in his briefcase grabbed a piece of paper and wrote out I Abraham Lincoln president of the United States pardon this man so and so he said here take it to him take it to him and remember him said that man took off running to the prison he ran in the prison and said listen I got a pardon for you he said what are you talking about you come here to humiliate me you mean brother Andrew you come all the way here you're saying all these great things about a message and a third pool and a resurrected Messiah living in me then I can do the Greater Works listen brother Andrew you don't realize who you're talking to you're talking to a kid that's been abused you don't realize who you're talking to you're talking to a kid

well I say this it can change anybody's future it can change your future I'm not humiliating you I'm preaching to you I went before God today and I studied the words of the seventh angel and he sent me here tonight to tell you this receive your pardon thank you brother Andrew you don't understand you're exactly right but I understand my books I don't understand by your family lineage I don't understand by your situation but I understand by books that there'll be a branch that will arise out of this Sodom age and he said don't don't don't humiliate me with that just just go on he said but no listen to me it's a pardon he said if it was a real pardon it would have an official seal and it wouldn't look like that it wouldn't be in 1100 books and tapes with improper English and Hanks and tanks and tanks and but listen to me if you can accept it son you can go free but it's not official he turned his back he turned his back and he went to the firing squad oh God it's breaking on me he went to the firing squad and he died the next morning because he refused to accept his pardon in a dispensation of Grace and they took it to the Supreme Court and they said judge they killed him he shouldn't have been killed and the judge ruled that a pardon brother Austin apparent it's not a pardon Elijah unless it's received as a pardon well I tell you this and I'm done this message is a pardon this message is an official document from the presence of God it may have improper English it may have misquoted Scriptures it may have Mr hookah it may have mispronounced words but it's a

church I just got to go ahead and say it but remember said if you get into this prophetic utterance it'll renew your strength I don't have time to teach it to you but I do have time to preach it right here if you get underneath this prophetic word I've got the quotes if you want them it'll awaken you to realize you're a prophetic class of people come on and then he said you'll hear the prophetic utterance he said and when you hear the prophetic utterance he said don't do nothing but make preparation like this he said if the spirit of Prophecy speaks to you he said that's got to be judged by two or three Witnesses before it can be presented to a church he said but if this message which is the prophet whatever is in this message listen I'm preaching to you prophetic word tonight and it's not up for opinion it's not up for suggestion it's thus saith the Lord well I might as well say it but REM said when Jeremiah got that message he said take it to the nation he said prophesy my Bible says in Revelation 10 take the book eat the book he said and then thou must prophesy again you know what it's time to do it's time to start saying what a word Prophet has already said Andrew I don't know about this message it's not up for debate it's absolute truth foreign if a prophet said it come on church can I preach to you I want to say this I say thank God for our brother and biscal thank

the voice I understand my books Elijah said and they have giphy up and drink for there is a sound of an abundance of rain says watch Elijah when he accepted it accepted what the prophetic utterance you know his life must have been renewed the day before Colby he couldn't even walk he accepted prophetic utterance and the prophet said he outrun ahab's chariot he run before the chariot when he couldn't even climb the hill he run before those Swift horses young people I understand by books [Music] that you are the generation [Music] I understand my books see what you're feeling right now is

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it was at this Camp here a couple years ago that my mother Who had who had been went through seven nine months of intense suffering in her body and and she had her platelets they couldn't keep it up and she just went through such a dark time of her life doctors were telling her that there would be no there was no cure that she would have to live by shots or uh and and strong medication and these these pills were they were thousands and thousands per pill and every shot was tens of thousands and amen and the spirit of the Lord was real strong we all came right up here and we prayed she went to the doctor the next day now she had an appointment that next day on that Monday [Music] and her platelets that they couldn't get up hardly at all was four hundred thousand Blake [Music] the doctor was saying now this can't be this can't be mama says well it is that's what it said and so she says well I'm ready to take it off my medicine and he says no no no no no no no no no no no you just you come back in a month she says well how about let's take off half the medicine or any you know for right now he said all right we'll take we'll cut it by a half we'll see you in a month amen she came back and the platelets were so Sky High he says man took her off all the medication now my mama had been having transfusions infusions she had been had but my she would she would stay there all day long at the doctor while they were running stuff through her veins trying to keep her alive it has been two years medicine free and we just got back from the doctor here a while back and her platelets are still high we're recording now I may be wrong that I see that I was in a service where brother Sean was preaching one time and a blind eye came open did I see that fella hey could come up here let's let's just just walk up front here this guy was blind [Applause] and while the word was being preached God healed this man's eye he was totally blind to which I wasn't he was totally blind in this side you know what he done and Hallelujah he covered the good eye up and drove home amen and he can still see Hallelujah ah Glory Glory oh we could go through some testimonies around here when I say I've seen blind eyes open I witnessed the before and in that same meeting where where our brother was healed we had went we had went to McDonald's or someplace and some of the brothers were there and uh would get eaten and and a lady had raised up her her skirt and showed us a spider bite that had been eating away at the leg and it was really in bad shape we prayed that night and by the next by the next night when we went back there was just a little dot the flesh had totally healed it had totally filled up [Applause] and you want me to say that this message doesn't work you're out of your mind this message works [Applause] Hallelujah brother Andrew and his wife had been had been married for 10 or 11 years 10 years they've been trying to have a baby since they had been married could not have that baby Hallelujah they've done a lot of stuff trying to get that baby here and and so we were at brother Manuel's a service and brother Jewel Forney was preaching and um amen and and I I I had been I had been telling her even I just really encouraging sister uh Christina and tell her you're going to have that baby don't you give up so she would text me and I'd text her back and we were just we were just pumping Faith to each other you know just believing and confessing that promise Amanda when she came up and brother Jewel you know he loves those special cases like that and I said she's wanting a baby and he goes oh man oh [Music] let's pray and we prayed Hallelujah and God gave her a baby gave her another baby [Applause] so so us preachers we really don't come up here having a prayer line just to waste her time and to make you feel good we are expecting results from our prayer and we're not up here preaching and just trying to get you in an emotional High We believe what we preach what glory to God don't you know the devil wish he didn't come to church tonight Hallelujah God is good to us amen are you glad you come to church this evening Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord well as we get ready to dismiss we want to just let him

the curfew so we're we're going to wear Glory and um so we'll let you have a little bit of time to teach your nachos and the fellowship a little bit I tell you what I'm glad I'm glad God came tonight and it wasn't that he wasn't here last night or this morning it was just building that Faith up getting us ready can you say mine and there's no telling what God has in store for tomorrow that's the good thing about God when you think oh I can't get any better and then he comes the next day and just amen that's just the way God is amen and so we love him so much here tonight and I just want to
