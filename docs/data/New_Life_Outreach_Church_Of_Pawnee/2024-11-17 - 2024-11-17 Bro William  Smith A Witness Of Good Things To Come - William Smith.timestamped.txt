[48:28] revelation in every Christian amen every
[48:31] believer cuz when you know that there's
[48:35] not a devil out there that's going to
[48:37] hurt you you might go through your
[48:39] trials and you might go through your
[48:41] tribulations but when oh Jesus gives you
[48:44] that
[48:46] Revelation nothing can take it from you
[48:50] praise be to
[48:51] God if we can open our Bibles to acts
[48:55] one and then we're going to go to
[48:58] Proverbs
[49:01] 14 I sent my scriptures to our sister
[49:05] but I don't know if she got them I did
[49:07] it too late probably but hopefully she
[49:09] can catch on quick here but
[49:13] here acts 1
[49:18] and8 but ye shall receive power after
[49:22] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[49:25] and he shall be Witnesses unto me both
[49:30] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[49:35] Samar and into U and unto the uttermost
[49:40] parts of the earth let's go to Proverbs
[49:44] 14 we like to start about the 25th
[49:54] verse here in Proverbs 14- 25 it says a
[49:59] true
[50:00] witness deliver
[50:03] Souls but a deceitful witness speaketh
[50:08] lies in the fear of the Lord is
[50:14] strong confidence and his children shall
[50:18] have a place of Refuge the fear of the
[50:23] Lord is a Fountain of Life to depart
[50:28] from the snares of death let's bow our
[50:31] heads Heavenly
[50:33] Father Lord we just love
[50:36] you Lord there's a lot of
[50:39] emotions knowing
[50:48] that this is our last service here
[50:53] as a member of this great church
[51:00] the
[51:01] Lord I'm a
[51:05] witness and Lord I just
[51:07] pray that you bless each and every
[51:11] heart I've had many here lately Lord
[51:13] send me texts tell telling me how they
[51:17] appreciate me and
[51:19] sharing what we've done in their
[51:23] lives and Lord I pray you bless them
[51:27] because it wasn't me it wasn't
[51:29] Sharon it had to been your holy goodness
[51:33] in our
[51:34] lives for us to to be able to do that
[51:39] Lord and Lord I ask you Lord to take
[51:42] this little
[51:43] thought and Lord I pray you bless each
[51:46] and every heart that's in this
[51:49] place and Lord let us be great Witnesses
[51:53] Lord of your Holy Ghost
[51:57] Lord we just ask these things in your
[51:59] wonderful name
[52:02] amen I would like to minister tonight if
[52:05] we could for a little while a witness of
[52:08] good things to
[52:13] come brother brandham
[52:16] preached a message called
[52:19] Witnesses and he said here he says
[52:22] Jesus here was appointing his apostles
[52:27] for the qualification of the holy spirit
[52:31] before they were were to
[52:34] be go excuse me let me restart that over
[52:38] the qualifications of the Holy Ghost
[52:41] before they were to go be
[52:45] Witnesses so there is a
[52:47] qualification for a a man or woman to be
[52:51] a
[52:52] witness of the good things to come amen
[52:56] I'm so thankful that I see a lot of
[52:59] witnesses here
[53:01] today I believe that God has touched
[53:04] each and every one of you even you young
[53:07] people but we have to make
[53:10] sure that
[53:12] we know what we're talking
[53:15] about it's not just reading your Bible
[53:19] and coming to
[53:21] church but it's a
[53:23] life it's something that's down deep in
[53:26] inside of your soul that's
[53:29] anchored between you and
[53:31] God that not a devil in hell can take it
[53:34] from you because there's things that
[53:37] God's going to have you do that other
[53:39] people are not going to
[53:41] understand because lots of people have
[53:43] to reason things out into their heads
[53:47] God doesn't want us to reason things out
[53:50] he wants us to have faith in the word
[53:53] and if we have faith in that word it
[53:56] it's going to make you do things that
[53:59] you would never do at all because God is
[54:04] doing
[54:06] it and brother random talked about this
[54:09] court of witnesses has to know
[54:14] something just anybody can't come in and
[54:17] be a witness it's got to be somebody who
[54:21] knows something yeah and that's the way
[54:24] it is when a when are witnessing of the
[54:28] Lord it takes somebody who knows
[54:32] something so
[54:34] Jesus thought said this that before they
[54:39] could become his Witnesses they had to
[54:43] wait in Jerusalem until they were endued
[54:48] with power from on high then they would
[54:52] be the witnesses of all over the world
[54:55] in jerus Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to
[54:59] the uttermost parts of the
[55:03] earth and so even the disciples as they
[55:07] followed him three and a half years they
[55:10] saw a lot of things happen they were
[55:14] eyewitnesses they had the ears to hear
[55:17] they had the eyes to see exactly who
[55:21] Jesus Christ on Earth in that three and
[55:23] a half years what he was doing all right
[55:27] they were
[55:29] eyewitnesses of Jesus
[55:32] Christ in the
[55:34] fullness yes sir but they still denied
[55:38] him right before he got
[55:41] crucified so it takes more than just
[55:44] being an
[55:45] eyewitness you have to have an
[55:48] experience in what you
[55:53] see and so he goes on and he says here
[55:56] and he
[55:59] says he goes and he says in the court or
[56:04] let's go to Acts 2 acts 225
[56:09] first it says for thou shall be his
[56:13] Witnesses unto all men of what thou Hast
[56:17] seen and
[56:19] heard and then brother Braham keeps
[56:22] going down and he says in the courts
[56:24] there is two kinds of WI witnesses that
[56:27] will
[56:28] stand that's
[56:30] ey or
[56:33] ear now if you're sitting in a room and
[56:37] looking through a glass and see an
[56:41] accident your witness your word is no
[56:45] good okay because you were looking
[56:49] through a
[56:51] glass I believe that's what's happening
[56:53] with the denominations today there
[56:56] they're witnessing something but they're
[56:58] not in actual involvement of the word of
[57:02] God because they're on a Creed they're
[57:04] taking a Creed instead of the word of
[57:06] God they're seeing the good things
[57:09] they're reading the good things but it's
[57:11] not coming to life into their life
[57:14] they're hoping that this is happening
[57:16] they're hoping that Trump is going to do
[57:18] something great they're hoping because
[57:20] he's saying Jesus this and Jesus is that
[57:23] but if we don't get watch out what we're
[57:25] saying and looking we're going to follow
[57:28] that same group thinking that he is
[57:31] something special he is just a man that
[57:34] has been voted in by a population of
[57:38] people right and we know through the
[57:41] word of God that this world is
[57:45] doomed right they're witnessing
[57:47] something but they never had the
[57:49] experience of the Holy Spirit coming
[57:52] down inside of their soul and showing
[57:55] them the true
[57:57] word right and we're so happy to see
[58:01] people saying Christian things but you
[58:04] can go on there and see there's people
[58:06] that are hating so much
[58:10] hate the devil is hating the
[58:15] people movie stars pops off and says oh
[58:19] he ain't going to get it no no no they
[58:23] have to watch what they say just like
[58:25] what you and and I have to say they're
[58:27] witnessing something but they don't have
[58:30] the real because they're looking through
[58:32] that
[58:34] glass our children has to have an
[58:38] experience just like you and you and
[58:40] Mama and
[58:42] daddies so you have to teach them how to
[58:46] get Jesus in them that Holy
[58:50] Spirit you've got to be an example you
[58:54] have to walk this walk and talk his walk
[58:57] with thus sayeth the Lord right amen
[59:01] amen and he says here and he goes and he
[59:04] says your word is no good because you
[59:08] were looking through a glass you have to
[59:12] be right there close to really know what
[59:15] you're talking about before you can be a
[59:20] witness you have to hear
[59:22] it or you have to see it before you can
[59:27] be a witness on the
[59:31] court or a case in the
[59:34] courts you can't
[59:37] say Miss so and so told me or Mr so and
[59:41] so told me Reverend so I like how he's
[59:43] put this Reverend so and so told me he's
[59:47] a witness but are
[59:50] you are you a witness all right you've
[59:53] got to hear what comes across this
[59:55] pulpit and take it home and dissect it
[59:58] and and and get into the word yourself
[1:00:00] and get the same Revelation from
[1:00:05] God We Trust in brother Wendell with all
[1:00:08] of our hearts but he can't get you there
[1:00:12] he can lead you there he can bring you
[1:00:14] to the word but now you have to eat the
[1:00:18] book and when you eat the book then you
[1:00:21] become an
[1:00:22] eyewitness of the good things to come
[1:00:26] and when that comes into your life and
[1:00:28] when you start seeing the manifestation
[1:00:30] of God living inside of your life
[1:00:32] through testimonies through things that
[1:00:34] God has done for you amen then you're
[1:00:37] not going up and going down and going up
[1:00:40] now you might go through a trial you
[1:00:42] might go through these things but you
[1:00:44] have thust sayith the Lord knowing that
[1:00:46] he's holding your hand and if you know
[1:00:49] that he's holding your hand you're not
[1:00:50] going to worry about cancer you're not
[1:00:52] going to worry about sickness you're not
[1:00:54] going to worry about your bill because
[1:00:56] you're going to trust in God if he wants
[1:00:59] you on the street then just trust him am
[1:01:02] for my God said he doesn't wants you on
[1:01:04] the streets
[1:01:06] yeah he wants you to be a
[1:01:08] witness he wants to show you that you
[1:01:12] are his children and he works through
[1:01:15] his children that great body
[1:01:20] Hallelujah so therefore no man can
[1:01:24] exactly Witness to the resurrection of
[1:01:28] Christ only by the Holy
[1:01:32] Ghost you have to be a personal witness
[1:01:37] yourself being there knowing something
[1:01:41] about it knowing what you're talking
[1:01:45] about and God help us to see that
[1:01:49] day what when men will be just what they
[1:01:54] are you know I say this now with all
[1:02:00] respect it isn't your City full of
[1:02:05] bootle joints yeah that's hurting us
[1:02:09] yeah here's what's hurting
[1:02:12] us more than ever is people who are
[1:02:15] professing to be Christians and not
[1:02:18] living it okay that's the thing see
[1:02:22] there's not a correct witness that's so
[1:02:25] true
[1:02:27] so if we're going to be a witness to God
[1:02:30] we've got to be living the word and to
[1:02:33] live the word is getting into the book
[1:02:36] getting into the message of the hour
[1:02:39] coming to church you might not like
[1:02:41] something that's going on in the church
[1:02:43] but you're not here because of that
[1:02:45] you're here to hear what comes across
[1:02:47] the pulpit what the word of God is
[1:02:49] helping you and I you could be at work
[1:02:53] and you can hear all them guys cussing
[1:02:54] and you can be listening to to the tape
[1:02:57] but you're not not going to go to work
[1:02:59] because that guy's
[1:03:00] cussing see we we we start picking and
[1:03:04] choosing what we want to do that's not a
[1:03:07] witness of God if you say that you're a
[1:03:10] man of God and a girl Christian girl or
[1:03:14] a mama that's a Christian you're going
[1:03:16] to come to church and show that person
[1:03:18] that's a hypocrite a real Christian by
[1:03:21] living a life in front of them all right
[1:03:26] then you'll have a witness behind you
[1:03:30] knowing
[1:03:31] oh that brother's got
[1:03:34] something and I've said some bad things
[1:03:37] about him but he's a real Christian you
[1:03:41] could be their savior with the Holy
[1:03:43] Ghost okay that's in
[1:03:46] you what we say out of our mouths hurts
[1:03:50] or
[1:03:51] blesses what we think doesn't hurt the
[1:03:55] other person
[1:03:56] it hurts you that's
[1:03:58] true because what we think we say if
[1:04:02] we're thinking on the good things of God
[1:04:04] we're thinking what God had done for us
[1:04:06] we won't be thinking and looking at
[1:04:08] other people and seeing bad
[1:04:12] things because now we're a real witness
[1:04:16] of the good things that come glory amen
[1:04:20] Proverbs 14:5 it says a faithful witness
[1:04:24] will not lie
[1:04:26] but a false witness will utterly
[1:04:31] lie we have a lot of them in the world
[1:04:34] today they call themselves Christians
[1:04:37] and they're cussing and they lie and
[1:04:39] they tell their bosses that this and
[1:04:41] that but a real Christian lives on the
[1:04:46] word of God and he's a he's an
[1:04:50] ambass he's a man or a woman that's
[1:04:53] standing in the place of God Walk in on
[1:04:56] the earth with the Holy Ghost living
[1:04:57] inside of
[1:04:59] him to show The Sinner that they need
[1:05:02] Grace what they've got in them that's a
[1:05:06] witness that's a true
[1:05:08] witness hallelujah
[1:05:12] hallelujah they can't witness until they
[1:05:14] have an
[1:05:16] experience and when they have an
[1:05:18] experience then they become a
[1:05:21] witness
[1:05:23] automatically because they are born
[1:05:28] again and all of the things of this
[1:05:31] world old things have passed away and
[1:05:35] all things have become new then you
[1:05:39] become a witness unto
[1:05:43] Jesus that's what that's what the three
[1:05:46] steps all
[1:05:47] about justification saves you
[1:05:51] sanctification cleans you up cleans you
[1:05:55] and then the third is the baptism of the
[1:05:58] Holy Ghost it gives you the power to be
[1:06:01] Witnesses of what you receive in your
[1:06:05] heart amen if you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:06:09] you're going to produce the word you're
[1:06:13] going to produce every sign that is in
[1:06:16] the promise in the book every promise in
[1:06:20] the book is mine and so I should be able
[1:06:22] to prophesy and witness of every bit of
[1:06:24] it all right because now I have the Holy
[1:06:28] Ghost and the Holy Ghost leads and
[1:06:31] guides us to all
[1:06:34] truth we're not all going to understand
[1:06:37] the same
[1:06:38] thing but it's going to take brother
[1:06:41] Michael and me and brother wendle and
[1:06:43] brother Ken to talk things and talk
[1:06:47] about things and have an experience
[1:06:49] together as brothers cuz maybe brother
[1:06:52] Ken has something that I don't got maybe
[1:06:54] brother Michael has something that don't
[1:06:56] God maybe I'm looking at something wrong
[1:06:58] and I come to brother Wendell he says
[1:06:59] well this is what I see in the
[1:07:01] scripture what is he doing he's not
[1:07:04] kicking me he's Lifting me up to be a
[1:07:07] greater witness Hallelujah I want to be
[1:07:10] a greater
[1:07:12] witness I know that you want to be a
[1:07:14] greater witness and to be a greater
[1:07:16] witness you have to eat the book to
[1:07:20] become the book you got to eat it
[1:07:23] hallelujah hallelujah praise be to God
[1:07:26] Jesus knew before these
[1:07:29] Apostles could ever go out and be a
[1:07:32] correct
[1:07:33] witness that they had to have an
[1:07:37] experience what they were witnessing
[1:07:39] about okay wouldn't that be nice
[1:07:44] today if every Seminary did the same
[1:07:47] thing if every Christian did the same
[1:07:51] thing would just come to church and say
[1:07:54] now I accept Jesus as my personal
[1:07:58] savior I'm going to stay right here
[1:08:02] until I get the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:05] Ghost and then I'm going out to be a
[1:08:10] witness
[1:08:11] see things would be different don't you
[1:08:15] think
[1:08:16] so he would not have that loose
[1:08:21] scattered
[1:08:23] testimonies if we're going to be witness
[1:08:26] and have testimonies we've got to be
[1:08:29] living oh church we make mistakes but
[1:08:32] that's what the Holy Ghost is there for
[1:08:34] to patch you on the back and say hey get
[1:08:37] right but right before you do it he
[1:08:40] grabs a hold of your heart and you
[1:08:42] go yeah Mama I didn't take the trash
[1:08:46] out cuz you would have said no I I took
[1:08:49] the trash
[1:08:50] out or I did this mama
[1:08:54] yeah but see when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:08:57] and starts messing with your
[1:09:00] spirit what is he doing he's protecting
[1:09:03] you and when he's protecting you from
[1:09:06] the sins of the world he's telling you
[1:09:08] don't
[1:09:09] lie don't do that don't smoke that
[1:09:12] cigarette don't do this it's because
[1:09:15] he's working on your conscience and when
[1:09:18] he's working on your conscious you
[1:09:20] should be able to say okay Lord
[1:09:22] hallelujah yes Lord do you know before
[1:09:25] you even come to God God was working on
[1:09:28] your conscience when those kids at
[1:09:31] school were trying to teach you to smoke
[1:09:33] and do things like that your conscience
[1:09:35] started going uh I know that's wrong I
[1:09:38] can't do that that's God tapping into
[1:09:40] there trying to protect that person yeah
[1:09:44] hello
[1:09:46] amen but what happens is we shun it we
[1:09:50] shun it because we let things that we're
[1:09:52] feeding off of make us grow into
[1:09:54] something that we shouldn't be we're
[1:09:57] feeding that black dog more than we're
[1:09:58] feeding the white
[1:10:00] dog the reason why we ain't Overcomers
[1:10:03] is because we're feeding the black dog
[1:10:04] more than we're feeding the white
[1:10:08] dog
[1:10:09] amen and so now he's saying scattered
[1:10:14] testimonies I don't want a scattered
[1:10:17] testimony I want to be on fire for God I
[1:10:19] want people to see that it ain't brother
[1:10:22] William doing nothing except believing
[1:10:24] and God God's doing the work through him
[1:10:28] I want people to see that brother
[1:10:29] William's real and those that have been
[1:10:32] texting me telling me how much I've done
[1:10:34] for you God bless you you don't know
[1:10:36] what that had done for
[1:10:40] me you should be telling other people in
[1:10:42] here that that's not leaving you should
[1:10:45] be doing this all the time to one
[1:10:47] another encouraging instead of put a
[1:10:50] knife in them all the time we need to
[1:10:53] encourage amen
[1:10:57] one of the greatest Witnesses in the Old
[1:11:00] Testament God encouraged him when Moses
[1:11:04] died he went to he went to
[1:11:08] Joshua and he put a jagger right into
[1:11:10] his heart no he encouraged him you're
[1:11:15] more than
[1:11:17] conqueror you go across here and I'll be
[1:11:20] with you just like I was with Moses he
[1:11:23] had an experience cuz God spoke to him
[1:11:26] and when he speaks to him now he can
[1:11:28] stand there and look at Israel and say
[1:11:30] we're going to go across and we're going
[1:11:32] to kill our enemies because now he's a
[1:11:35] witness of something that he seen or he
[1:11:39] heard wonderful praise be to God bless
[1:11:42] the Lord we can
[1:11:45] see here is here's the one of the
[1:11:47] greatest people God had Witnesses in the
[1:11:50] Old Testament and one witness was Noah
[1:11:54] Noah was a witness because that he had
[1:11:57] heard the voice of God in
[1:12:01] warning that telling him that there was
[1:12:05] coming a flood and that he must build an
[1:12:10] ark and prep preparation of the Ark was
[1:12:14] to get ready at once and he was to
[1:12:18] prepare a place for a safety for the
[1:12:24] people what did our Prophet do for us he
[1:12:28] broke the seals he opened up the church
[1:12:31] ages so that you can see the spirit
[1:12:34] behind all these
[1:12:36] churches he has come and given you a
[1:12:39] word that you and I can grab a hold of
[1:12:42] and you can be an overcomer of the
[1:12:45] things of the world because the Holy
[1:12:47] Spirit comes down inside of
[1:12:49] you and gives you the power to be great
[1:12:53] Witnesses of things to
[1:12:58] come your whole life is a journey from
[1:13:02] now until the day you die or you go in a
[1:13:05] Rapture you have to come to a
[1:13:08] place that he's everything to
[1:13:13] you
[1:13:15] everything Jes if your job is more
[1:13:17] important and you spend more time
[1:13:19] looking up businesses and all these
[1:13:21] kinds of things and you're trying to
[1:13:23] find more tools for your for for your
[1:13:25] businesses and you're trying to do this
[1:13:27] and do that you young people you're on
[1:13:29] there looking at a bunch of nonsense
[1:13:31] you're not going to be a good witness to
[1:13:33] God even if you say it out of your mouth
[1:13:36] you might as well be told now you're a
[1:13:41] liar because the Holy Ghost only brings
[1:13:44] us to the
[1:13:47] word it's not going to take us and do
[1:13:50] this over here and justify it he's going
[1:13:53] to condemn it
[1:13:56] because we're going to be
[1:13:58] Witnesses of
[1:14:04] something are you a hearer are you a
[1:14:09] seer or are you looking through a
[1:14:12] glass we need to fill that glass down
[1:14:15] and get out there among the word and get
[1:14:17] into the church and hear what God wants
[1:14:20] for you and for
[1:14:23] me Hallelujah
[1:14:25] these great
[1:14:27] Witnesses we got witnesses in the New
[1:14:32] Testament we got
[1:14:35] Peter you couldn't tell him how to fish
[1:14:39] cuz his daddy taught him when he was
[1:14:40] little he was one of the greatest
[1:14:42] fisherman out there he knew that this
[1:14:44] side of the boat you ain't going to
[1:14:45] catch
[1:14:48] nothing but when Jesus come and said
[1:14:51] Peter throw it on this side but Lord
[1:14:55] throw it on this side
[1:14:58] Peter he
[1:15:01] saw thus sayith the Lord speak well
[1:15:04] Glory all right and when he pulled up
[1:15:06] that net he was a witness he was a
[1:15:09] witness oh god of what God can
[1:15:12] do yes
[1:15:17] yes

[1:15:44] horse he was
[1:15:46] blind he couldn't see but he can
[1:15:50] hear yeah God blinded him so he can

[1:19:52] battles be a witness

[1:19:57] beating him and putting Stripes upon his
[1:19:59] back and putting nails in him and laid
[1:20:02] him on a cross your cross my
[1:20:05] cross he was a

[1:20:17] it's being manifested on Earth 1900
[1:20:21] years ago oh
[1:20:23] Jesus now we have the same holy ghost
[1:20:27] that was in him the same spirit that
[1:20:29] fell on him when he was born The Same
[1:20:31] Spirit that fell on him when he was
[1:20:33] being baptized is in you today The Same
[1:20:38] Spirit God Almighty living inside of you
[1:20:41] let's get this personal God living in
[1:20:45] you the hope of glory the one that saved
[1:20:49] you that came to Earth in a body
[1:20:55] to give you eternal life forever more
[1:20:58] bless oh Hallelujah now he's here in the
[1:21:03] form of the Holy
[1:21:06] Spirit I can see
[1:21:08] him you can see him you can hear
[1:21:13] him when you look at a real man of God a
[1:21:17] real daughter of God that's living
[1:21:20] scripture you can say there's Jesus in
[1:21:24] leather
[1:21:26] yeah why cuz that person is dedicated to
[1:21:30] the Lord yes every day they're
[1:21:34] dedicating their lives before they go to
[1:21:35] work they're dedicating themselves at
[1:21:37] lunchtime they're dedicating themselves
[1:21:39] at night before they go to bed with
[1:21:40] their
[1:21:43] family they're getting
[1:21:45] ready for good things to come they want
[1:21:49] to be a part of that witness they want
[1:21:51] to be a part of that
[1:21:53] testimony that they were raptured
[1:21:56] off
[1:21:59] Hallelujah here they
[1:22:01] are the great
[1:22:06] Witnesses we see here in the Old
[1:22:11] Testament the three three Hebrew
[1:22:18] children they love God they loved it
[1:22:21] they dedicated themselves to the love of
[1:22:23] God
[1:22:25] without the Holy Ghost Church they
[1:22:27] dedicated themselves and when that King
[1:22:32] says you look at this image and worship
[1:22:34] it they didn't do it why because they
[1:22:37] were a witness of something they heard
[1:22:40] or something they saw Yes in the
[1:22:42] scripture
[1:22:44] yes yes and as they were standing there
[1:22:48] and they put judgment on them you're
[1:22:50] going to the fiery furnace
[1:22:55] they said well praise the
[1:22:59] Lord we're going to go in there we're
[1:23:01] going to burn up and go and be in the
[1:23:02] presence of God because I'm not going to
[1:23:05] bow down to your
[1:23:06] image or he's going to save
[1:23:10] us and that King looked in there and he
[1:23:13] saw four not
[1:23:16] three a witness of good things to come
[1:23:20] because they had faith in God they had
[1:23:22] something that was more real to them
[1:23:25] they didn't care if they're going to die
[1:23:27] they believe the
[1:23:29] word they believe that God was going to
[1:23:32] take them and give them a testimony and
[1:23:35] not only a witness and a testimony when
[1:23:38] they came out they were put it up up
[1:23:41] here instead of down here
[1:23:45] why because those that believe in God
[1:23:48] those that live God God will manifest
[1:23:50] his holy spirit in their lives and signs
[1:23:53] and wonders will follow them that belief
[1:23:56] bless the
[1:23:58] Lord praise to God oh glory to God
[1:24:03] that's the reason tonight that many of
[1:24:05] the Christians hasn't got the victory is
[1:24:08] because their sins has separated him
[1:24:11] from the blessings cut them off out in
[1:24:15] all directions places along and our
[1:24:19] hearts are hanging on the webbing
[1:24:24] waggling
[1:24:28] trees oh church we need to quit
[1:24:33] looking at everything else except the
[1:24:36] word the word will set you free the word
[1:24:41] will get you on
[1:24:44] track but man I messed up brother
[1:24:47] William God can fix that mess up that
[1:24:52] quick that bloodline that our precious
[1:24:55] brother sung this evening that
[1:24:58] blood when you come underneath the blood
[1:25:01] Satan can't go in there no more he can't
[1:25:04] touch you because you're washed every
[1:25:07] sin is washed oh he's got it in his
[1:25:10] brain but it's not in God's brain it's
[1:25:13] not even in
[1:25:15] heaven it's all in
[1:25:19] Hil Satan's going to be
[1:25:22] tormented of what you could f
[1:25:28] yes every bad thought every bad stuff is
[1:25:32] because of him not
[1:25:35] you okay when you get under that
[1:25:40] blood every judgment is going to be on
[1:25:44] his shoulders not
[1:25:47] yours cuz your
[1:25:49] witness is the good things to come
[1:25:54] because
[1:25:56] why you came exactly what your pastor
[1:25:59] has said justification sanctification
[1:26:02] and the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost we should be seeking a refilling
[1:26:09] of the Holy Ghost every time we come to
[1:26:14] church that's true very
[1:26:20] true so it takes the six days a week
[1:26:23] prepare your yourself for
[1:26:27] this we've got to come to a
[1:26:30] place that we're going to be
[1:26:33] Witnesses or liar Witnesses

[1:27:20] people that some of us old folks forgot
[1:27:23] we should be hungry for this word we
[1:27:25] should be so hungry for the word of
[1:27:27] Fellowship around the people but what
[1:27:29] happens we get we get caught up in
[1:27:31] things and we go find a corner somewhere

[1:28:54] and they waited and they waited and they
[1:28:57] waited but when that Holy Ghost come it
[1:29:00] changed every one of their
[1:29:04] lives they had to go tell somebody about
[1:29:08] Jesus they had to tell somebody what the
[1:29:11] Holy Ghost was here for and what they do
[1:29:13] they went back to the Old Testament and
[1:29:15] showed them the things that why they
[1:29:17] were drunk because it was already
[1:29:19] prophesied in the Old Testament now the

[1:30:22] Lookers but if I would have got one of
[1:30:25] them I'd have been the most miserable
[1:30:27] person on the face of this Earth but
[1:30:30] when he gave me that
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:33] woman when she dots her eyes and flops
[1:30:36] my eyes around I do anything for
[1:30:41] her cuz I know she's at home she's
[1:30:44] taking care of the house she's taking
[1:30:46] care of my dog she's taking care of her
