[35:50] morning you love the Lord today amen if
[35:52] you have your Bibles this morning we
[35:54] want to go in the word of the Lord to
[35:56] the book of St Luke the 16 chapter and
[35:58] while you're turning there today we do
[36:00] want to say it is a real honor to be
[36:02] here with you once again in in py
[36:04] Oklahoma and the amen to be here with
[36:06] brother wend and the church we sure
[36:08] appreciate the opportunity and uh
[36:10] invitation to be here and we just pray
[36:12] something can be said today to be a
[36:13] blessing to you and a help and sure glad
[36:16] to have my wife here with us and Malachi
[36:18] and amen just had a wonderful time last
[36:20] night and the couple's banquet there and
[36:22] want to thank all the work and effort
[36:24] laborers that went into that and just a
[36:26] wonderful time to together fellowship
[36:28] and amen it's always a always a special
[36:31] time to serve the Lord amen amen the
[36:34] book of St Luke the 16th chapter and in
[36:37] the 16th verse Jesus here speaking he
[36:41] says now the law and the prophets were
[36:43] until John and since that time the
[36:47] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[36:51] presseth into it so it's not going to be
[36:54] easy but every man is going to pray into
[36:58] it now in the book of Philippians the
[37:00] thir
[37:01] chapter Philippians chapter 3 and verse
[37:05] number 13 Philippians 3 and 13 Paul here
[37:10] writing in Philippians 3 And1 13 and he
[37:14] says now Brethren I count not myself to
[37:16] have
[37:16] apprehended but this one thing I do
[37:20] forgetting those things which are behind
[37:23] and reaching forth unto those things
[37:25] which are before so Paul is very very
[37:27] clear that there are some things behind
[37:29] the church but whatever is behind the
[37:32] church is not worth going back to it's
[37:35] actually worth forgetting to the point
[37:37] he would say forget those things that
[37:38] are behind you but reach forth unto
[37:42] those things which are before now watch
[37:44] how you're going to get there he says
[37:46] now I press toward the mark for the
[37:48] prize of the High Calling of God in
[37:51] Christ Jesus so it's in front of you and
[37:54] you're going to have to press to get to
[37:56] it but you're not going to do it easily
[37:58] you're going to have to apply some force
[38:00] and press towards what God has said in
[38:03] front of you now in 2 Corinthians
[38:05] chapter 4 one other place I want to look
[38:07] this morning in 2 Corinthians chapter 4
[38:10] and verse number
[38:11] 13 Paul here writing again he says now
[38:15] we having the same Spirit of Faith
[38:19] according as it is written I have now as
[38:22] it is written I believed and therefore
[38:25] have I spoken he said now we also
[38:28] believe and therefore speak so the way a
[38:31] Believer presses forward is by believing
[38:34] the things that have been spoken in the
[38:37] same faith that they were spoken in look
[38:39] here in verse number 18 He says now
[38:42] while we look not at the things which
[38:44] are seen But at the things which are not
[38:47] seen for the things which are seen are
[38:50] temporal but the things which are not
[38:53] seen are Eternal amen we ask Lord this
[38:57] morning to add the blessing to the
[38:58] reading of his word as you can have your
[39:00] seats here today I want to uh by the
[39:02] help of the Lord for just a few moments
[39:04] from those verses of scripture if I
[39:06] would take a title here today I want to
[39:08] speak to you on this pressing by faith
[39:11] into the realities of the Unseen amen
[39:14] pressing by faith into the realities of
[39:17] the Unseen now in 1960 brother Bram
[39:19] preaches a very powerful sermon and he
[39:22] calls it the unfailing realities of the
[39:25] Living God the unfailing realities of
[39:27] the Living God and in that sermon
[39:29] brother speaking about how that people
[39:31] in the in the brandham Tabernacle there
[39:34] have been receiving the Holy Ghost and
[39:36] he said oh how many more that has
[39:38] received the Holy Ghost see it's begin
[39:40] to be a talk Among Us oh may it revive
[39:43] us to a spot notice may it revive us to
[39:46] a spot that we'll go to searching and
[39:49] hungering and pulling for the realities
[39:52] of God he said God is a reality amen I
[39:57] want to establish that this morning that
[39:59] God is a reality he's not he's not just
[40:02] a figment of our imagination he's not
[40:04] just an idol somewhere in another
[40:06] dimension but God is a reality another
[40:10] place in that sermon he said now the
[40:11] holy spirit amen will not misbehave
[40:14] itself in one person and behave itself
[40:17] in another See it'll make each person
[40:20] come into its character see because it's
[40:23] a spirit that leads you it brings and
[40:26] makes you subject to its nature you
[40:29] don't bring it subject to your nature
[40:31] but it makes you subject to its nature
[40:34] and the Holy Spirit makes you live and
[40:37] love to do it he said oh how you love to
[40:40] give up the things of the world when the
[40:42] Holy Spirit comes in he said how it
[40:44] cleanses you and washes you and puts a
[40:48] desire in you to follow him and they
[40:50] thirst and a hunger amen for more of it
[40:53] see you're just bathing yourself he
[40:56] brings realities one other place in that
[40:59] sermon he said what we need today is men
[41:02] and women who wants a reality amen not a
[41:06] Creed but a reality that's what the
[41:08] world needs today is not Creeds and
[41:11] Fashions amen we need realities in God
[41:15] the world don't want it the world they
[41:17] don't want to accept it amen but the
[41:19] church has to have it listen the church
[41:21] has to have it amen God wants you to
[41:24] have it amen because he's the god of of
[41:27] reality listen we don't have to have a
[41:30] fancy building we don't have to have a
[41:32] big bank account we don't have to have a
[41:34] bunch of things but there's one thing we
[41:36] have to have as the Church of the Living
[41:38] God we have to have the reality of God
[41:42] Amen because anything apart from the
[41:44] reality of God is a Creed or a fashion
[41:47] or a tradition now when you start
[41:49] talking about this pressing when you
[41:51] look there at that word press it means
[41:53] to move or to cause to move into to a
[41:57] position of contact with someone amen or
[42:01] something by exerting a continuous
[42:04] physical Force when you look there at
[42:06] the word reality amen it is a thing that
[42:09] exists in fact having previously only
[42:13] existed in one's mind so when something
[42:15] has become a reality at one time it was
[42:19] just in the mind amen but now it is come
[42:22] into existence of course we know amen
[42:25] the most powerful force is God right
[42:27] remember said there's no more powerful
[42:29] force than God but then he brings that
[42:31] down to the believer and he says the
[42:33] greatest power in the world Amen is not
[42:36] the atomic bomb but it is a believer in
[42:40] contact with his maker amen it changes
[42:42] the whole attitude it changes his mental
[42:45] it changes his habit it changes his body
[42:48] it changes his nature amen it changes
[42:51] everything when a man comes in contact
[42:54] with God Amen the powerful force of God
[42:58] has the ability Amen to change
[43:01] everything about the man or the woman
[43:03] who has just come in contact with him
[43:06] now in 1949 brother's preaching there
[43:09] and he's speaking upon the subject of
[43:11] Science and he shows amen that there is
[43:13] a natural man amen and there is a
[43:16] spiritual man he said now I was just
[43:18] thinking of how that science how they
[43:20] are taking the natural man how he's went
[43:22] in the research from the fall amen of
[43:24] the natural he said and what he has done
[43:27] he said but how little the spiritual man
[43:30] has progressed in the kingdom of God he
[43:33] said I was thinking that the natural man
[43:35] went out to the Unseen of his ey and he
[43:38] pulled an adom down out of the sky and
[43:40] he split that adom in two and that
[43:43] destroys human life he said but if the
[43:46] natural man that knows nothing of God
[43:49] and cannot know nothing of God except he
[43:51] be converted amen then his soul becomes
[43:54] alive with the supernatural if he could
[43:56] do that in the natural realm amen then
[43:59] what ought the man of God to be doing
[44:01] see he said friends the church is so far
[44:04] behind amen let's pray that God will
[44:07] move his church up amen let's pray that
[44:11] God will move his church up the natural
[44:14] man with the natural resource is getting
[44:16] greater results than people are amen
[44:19] that call themselves Christian he said
[44:21] now let's press into the Unseen amen
[44:25] let's press into the Unseen the
[44:28] blessings are yours they are there for
[44:31] you so a prophet identified With the
[44:33] blessings that belong to a Believer are
[44:36] dwelling amen they're not dwelling in
[44:38] this visible realm but they are dwelling
[44:41] in The Invisible realm and the only way
[44:43] you're going to get there is you're
[44:45] going to have to press listen God is not
[44:47] going to bring these unseen blessings
[44:49] into this visible real and just hand
[44:52] them to you but you're going to have to
[44:54] press against the force of devils and
[44:56] the force force of darkness and the
[44:58] force of unbelief listen but a prophet
[45:00] said they're there and if you'll put
[45:02] forth some effort you will break through
[45:05] and you will possess what God has
[45:07] ordained you to possess in the age that
[45:09] you're living in now when I think of
[45:11] this brother R preaches it about three
[45:13] different times and he actually tells us
[45:15] you got to look amen at the Unseen a
[45:19] prophet didn't just come and tell us
[45:20] something but he told us what we got to
[45:22] look at he said you got to look at the
[45:25] Unseen very power ful quote looking at
[45:28] the Unseen 1950 he said now we look at
[45:31] the
[45:32] Unseen and we believe that those things
[45:35] which are unseen amen but spoke of by
[45:38] God Amen they become realities amen we
[45:42] look at the Unseen and believe that
[45:45] those things which are unseen amen but
[45:48] spoke of by God Amen they become
[45:51] realities amen so the spoken word is
[45:55] what makes a difference in what Bec a
[45:57] reality and what don't amen if it has
[45:59] been spoken of by God Amen there's going
[46:02] to be somebody believe it and it's going
[46:05] to become a reality 1963 uniting time
[46:09] and sign he said those three Magi isn't
[46:12] it strange amen that these stars were
[46:14] exactly in line amen for three men but
[46:17] nobody else saw it he said now you can
[46:20] be so in line with the scripture when
[46:22] those stars become in unity amen they
[46:25] United themselves together in this
[46:27] constellation amen three men were also
[46:30] United at the same time he said and you
[46:33] can be so United with God in his word
[46:37] until these things become reality and
[46:40] you can see them and know that they are
[46:43] true another place he said but
[46:45] impossible things are made real amen
[46:48] when God is took at his word amen The
[46:51] Impossible is made realities when God is
[46:54] taken at his word listen friends I think
[46:57] it's time to quit settling amen for
[46:59] shadows and types when we have been
[47:01] promised the reality I think it's time
[47:04] to quit selling for whatever the devil
[47:06] hands us amen I think it's time to get
[47:08] some grit about us I think it's time to
[47:10] get a backbone about us I think it's
[47:12] time to draw a sword amen and start
[47:15] pressing back against the Demons of
[47:17] Darkness that don't want you to possess
[47:20] amen what God died for you to possess he
[47:23] died that you could have joy he died
[47:25] that you could have peace he died that
[47:27] you can have Victory he died that this
[47:30] church could have a Revival and every
[47:32] devil in hell has done everything they
[47:34] can Amen to conquer the Church of the
[47:36] Living God but I say away with Satan's
[47:39] Doom and Gloom and up with the power of
[47:41] the Holy Ghost In the Flesh of the
[47:43] Church of God believe in the hard things
[47:46] but watching them become
[47:49] realities my when God is taking his word
[47:53] you say God is taking at his word amen
[47:55] what is it church it's the infallibility
[47:58] amen of God's spoken word brother said
[48:01] if this audience tonight amen could only
[48:04] get settled in their mind of who said
[48:07] this amen what this reality is amen this
[48:11] spoken word we would need a healing
[48:13] service we wouldn't need a Salvation
[48:15] altar call it would be finished if you
[48:18] just realized amen what the word was
[48:22] come on before it could be a word spoken
[48:25] it had to be a thought but because a
[48:27] word is a thought manifest when God
[48:30] speaks he said now then back in the
[48:32] beginning when God looked down through
[48:33] the corridors of heaven and he saw all
[48:36] these things were going to happen on
[48:37] Earth did you ever just sit and draw a
[48:39] picture out in your mind he said now
[48:41] that's the way God did it perhaps in the
[48:43] beginning and then it seemed good to him
[48:46] amen so he spoke it and as soon as it
[48:48] was spoken it became a word and the
[48:51] thought was expressed in a word now
[48:54] listen once God expresses his thought
[48:57] and makes it a word he can never take it
[49:00] back amen when God stresses his thought
[49:04] and makes it a word he can never take it
[49:08] back come on church but all the
[49:10] difference is is who said it listen it
[49:13] matters who said something it determines
[49:15] how much stock you're going you look
[49:18] good it determines what stock you're
[49:20] going to put in it amen can I say it to
[49:22] you like this amen if you go down here
[49:24] to the coffee shop amen and you're
[49:26] sitting there and some guy drinking
[49:27] coffee just hollers out we're going to
[49:29] war well you just laugh at that walk out
[49:32] and move on with your life but if the
[49:34] president stands up and says we're going
[49:36] to war everybody stops and starts
[49:39] thinking about it see because it
[49:41] determines who said it listen it wasn't
[49:43] a preacher that said you were the bride
[49:46] it wasn't a preacher that said you had
[49:48] the power to overcome it wasn't a
[49:50] preacher that said these things it was
[49:52] God that spoke these things I think it's
[49:54] time to quit putting a little stock in I
[49:57] think it's time to invest everything we
[49:59] are in the word that God has spoken in
[50:02] the age that we're living in my before
[50:05] the foundation of the world Jesus spoke
[50:07] these things and somebody is going to
[50:10] become the material or the reality of
[50:13] the thoughts that he thought and the
[50:15] words that he spoke yes sir my goodness
[50:19] amen you say Well when was it thoroughly
[50:21] paid for it was thoroughly paid by Jesus
[50:24] Christ and you accepted it and as long
[50:27] as God accepted Christ he accepted you
[50:30] with Christ and when did he do it before
[50:33] the foundation of the world when he
[50:36] spoke him into existence he spoke you
[50:39] redeemed with him when God spoke the
[50:42] lamb into existence as the same time
[50:45] that he spoke you as the redeemed amen
[50:49] by the one who he was speaking into
[50:51] existence to do the
[50:52] redeeming my church then that brings it
[50:55] down to this that we're not just human
[50:57] beings we're actually a two-fold being
[51:00] see there is an outward man brother said
[51:03] and then there is an inward man he said
[51:05] now the outward man looks by his eyes
[51:08] amen but the inward man looks by faith
[51:10] amen now notice this the outward man is
[51:14] self but the inward man is God oh Church
[51:18] the outward man is self but the inward
[51:21] man is God he said you do not see with
[51:24] her eyes though many times we thought we
[51:26] with our eyes amen we only look with our
[51:29] eyes amen but we see with our heart see
[51:32] brother said oh Christians amen pinch
[51:35] the Inside Man now and wake up to the
[51:39] reality that Jesus Christ is here Amen
[51:42] to manifest himself to you listen there
[51:45] is a reality of God that is not a
[51:48] Million Miles Away folks it's right here
[51:51] in this building this morning and if you
[51:53] can pinch your conscience and awaken the
[51:56] inside man to see that there is more
[51:59] than just humans in here there is more
[52:01] than just preachers in this building but
[52:03] there is a Angelic host that it filled
[52:06] this building this morning and they're
[52:08] not sent here to condemn you come on
[52:10] we're all humans we make mistakes we
[52:12] have faults and we have failures but the
[52:15] angels of God are sent Amen to The Heirs
[52:18] of Salvation Amen to minister good
[52:21] things unto you my goodness I think it's
[52:24] time to quit selling underneath This
[52:26] Cloud of depression and and oppression
[52:28] and condemnation and amen I know we've
[52:31] all made mistakes amen but somewhere or
[52:33] Another You Got to Believe In The Blood
[52:35] or not and I tell you what the blood is
[52:37] it's a powerful blood it's an
[52:39] authoritative blood it has the ability
[52:41] to erase the sin and to fold in the sea
[52:44] of forgetfulness and to open up a new
[52:46] chapter to you you say well I'm 60 or 50
[52:49] or 40 years old hey there is no age
[52:51] limits on the blood of Jesus Christ it
[52:54] can reach to an old man can reach to a
[52:57] young
[52:58] man my wake up to the reality that Jesus
[53:02] Christ is here and he's here Amen to
[53:05] manifest himself to you I believe it
[53:08] folks I believe the time has come amen
[53:10] for the Believers to
[53:12] move I believe it's time to come for us
[53:14] to press amen but to press forward
[53:17] prophet of God said what we got to do is
[53:19] we got to press forward and we got to
[53:21] take the promise that God Almighty has
[53:23] given us he said see what we are under
[53:26] is we are under a Divine commission that
[53:29] is a Divine commission Amen to possess
[53:32] Divine promises remember said a man
[53:34] that's commissioned of God Amen he looks
[53:36] upward and onward you don't have to care
[53:38] what the world says about it anyhow he's
[53:41] not listening to the world he's got a
[53:43] Divine commission from God and he is
[53:47] enjoying the presence of God listen a
[53:50] man that is commissioned of God he don't
[53:52] look behind him a man that's
[53:54] commissioned of God he don't look to the
[53:56] to the left or to the right but a man
[53:58] that is commissioned of God has One
[54:00] Direction he looks that is onward and
[54:03] upward see because the Holy Ghost amen
[54:06] knows your destination he knows what the
[54:09] power of God is calling you to and he's
[54:11] here Among Us I'll say this he's not
[54:14] just here to make us
[54:16] shout he's not just here to make us
[54:18] dance or feel good but he's here to make
[54:21] us perseverant because if there's
[54:23] anything that we need in this hour is we
[54:25] need pers persevering Christians if
[54:27] there's anything we need in this hour
[54:29] amen is perseverant preachers we need
[54:32] perseverant churches we need perseverant
[54:34] young people listen it's going to get
[54:36] harder and it's going to get harder and
[54:39] it's going to get harder but brother
[54:40] Kobe there's going to be Believers
[54:42] that's going to get stronger and they're
[54:44] going to get stronger and they're going
[54:45] to get more determined listen I want to
[54:47] tell that devil I'm not
[54:50] quitting I'm not quitting devil throw
[54:53] everything you want to against me pile
[54:55] everything up against me you want to but
[54:57] I'm not quitting because there is a
[54:59] perseverance in my soul I've got a
[55:02] destination to go to I've got a goal to
[55:05] make brother said then every Christian
[55:07] amen should be very perseverant in their
[55:10] claims towards god listen I say this
[55:12] we're not just pressing but we're
[55:14] actually pressing toward something which
[55:17] is the mark of the high calling in
[55:19] Christ Jesus he said to the complete
[55:23] identification when all time will fade
[55:25] out into eternity amen when Jesus comes
[55:29] another place we're not going to have a
[55:31] rearview mirror Affair see a rearview
[55:33] mirror Affair only looks back to see
[55:36] where you've been but it's not looking
[55:38] back to see where you've been we're
[55:40] looking forward to see where we're going
[55:43] amen see because the scripture did
[55:45] promise things back there but it also
[55:48] promises things here and it promises
[55:51] things ahead of the church what are we
[55:52] doing we are pressing into the
[55:55] Fulfillment of scriptural promises
[55:57] listen folks the Rapture is a scriptural
[56:00] promise and somebody is going to
[56:03] persevere they're going to press and
[56:05] they're going to press and they're going
[56:07] to press and they're going to make it by
[56:10] the grace of God we find them the only
[56:13] way to advance is to press Paul or
[56:15] rather Jesus said amen the kingdom of
[56:17] God is preached and every man presseth
[56:19] into it that word presses means to use
[56:22] and to apply Force I love what Paul said
[56:25] he said in first Corinthians 9 I
[56:27] therefore so run amen not as uncertainly
[56:31] amen so fight I amen not as one that
[56:35] beateth the
[56:36] air so that tells me Church we're not
[56:40] fighting flesh and blood but we are
[56:42] fighting Spirits we are fighting powers
[56:45] and principalities and demons of
[56:48] darkness and come on we're fighting
[56:50] things but let me say this amen it's
[56:52] time to fight it's not time to quit it's
[56:55] time to fight Jesus said every man
[56:57] presses into it amen not just simply
[57:00] walks into it easily but it's got to be
[57:02] pressed into now this desperation
[57:05] brother preaches about what it does is
[57:07] it causes you to press now it's not a
[57:10] fearful or a begging desperation but it
[57:13] is a desperation with a sense of urgency
[57:17] Amen brother said see since then the
[57:19] Kingdom of Heaven has been preached and
[57:21] Men press into it you don't just stand
[57:24] around and say pick me up by the father
[57:26] Lord and push me on in no you press into
[57:30] it you get desperate it's between life
[57:33] and death now look here R man preaches
[57:36] the sermon 1963 desperations and he
[57:39] opens his Prayer by saying this I want
[57:42] to speak tonight on giving them courage
[57:45] to encourage them to take that god-given
[57:47] ride they have a right to defeat the
[57:50] Devil he is
[57:52] already
[57:54] defeated you have a right to defeat the
[57:57] Devil he is already defeated and he is
[58:01] just bluffing them he said but I'm
[58:03] claiming them Father now help me to
[58:05] speak the word amen you speak through me
[58:08] Lord with this few notes I got wrote
[58:11] down here and little scriptures wrote
[58:12] out I pray that you'll help me Lord amen
[58:15] and get in the word and give them faith
[58:19] for the glory of God so a prophet was
[58:22] inviting amen the author of this word
[58:25] amen to come to the platform and to get
[58:28] in the sermon that he was preaching but
[58:31] let it be more than a sermon Let It Be
[58:33] An empowering Let It Be A Feeling let it
[58:36] be a surge of faith into the hearts of
[58:39] the Believers to recognize their enemy
[58:42] is already defeated and they've got a
[58:45] right to defeat him oh church but listen
[58:48] the only way they're going to do it is
[58:50] by faith look here in Hebrews 11:1 Paul
[58:53] says that faith is the substance of
[58:56] things hoped for is the evidence of
[58:58] Things Not Seen amen for by it the
[59:02] elders obtained a good report now watch
[59:04] this and through faith we understand
[59:08] that the worlds were framed by the word
[59:10] of God Amen so that things which are
[59:13] seen were not made of things which do
[59:16] appear reben comes along and he said now
[59:19] listen you testify of the things you do
[59:23] not
[59:24] see my goodness
[59:26] because faith is the substance of things
[59:29] hoped for it's the evidence of things
[59:31] you do not see and we look at the Unseen
[59:35] so a Christian does not testify of what
[59:38] you see you testify of what you don't
[59:41] see in other words we can see the
[59:43] problem we can see the trouble we can
[59:46] see the issue but that's not what we
[59:48] talk about we talk about the things we
[59:51] don't see because the things we don't
[59:54] see are more real than the things we do
[59:59] see now come on folks you see the
[1:00:01] problems and you see the issues and you
[1:00:03] see the troubles and you see the
[1:00:04] sickness and you see the chains of sin
[1:00:07] and you see all the issues amen but
[1:00:09] listen that's not what we talk about
[1:00:11] because the Bible said the things we see
[1:00:13] are
[1:00:14] temporary come on but the things we
[1:00:17] don't see are Eternal so what we see
[1:00:20] that's temporary could be here today and
[1:00:22] it could be gone tomorrow somebody say
[1:00:24] why don't you talk about the problem
[1:00:26] more because the problem could change
[1:00:28] while I'm talking about it because I can
[1:00:31] see it and it's temporary but I'm going
[1:00:33] to talk about something that never
[1:00:35] changes and that's the word of God
[1:00:37] that's the promises of God he said see
[1:00:40] faith is something amen that's born in
[1:00:42] you it's something that God gives you
[1:00:45] amen faith is Supernatural and it does
[1:00:48] Supernatural things he said then that
[1:00:51] faith comes in amen here at the bottom
[1:00:53] of the pyramid he said then that
[1:00:55] spiritual Faith amen it recognizes only
[1:00:59] the word amen no matter what anybody
[1:01:02] else says it don't do no good amen that
[1:01:05] Faith only knows the word look here in
[1:01:08] perfect Faith he said faith is something
[1:01:11] that you have to believe it's
[1:01:14] there come on folks you got to go beyond
[1:01:16] Believing by what you see you got to go
[1:01:19] beyond Believing by the way you feel you
[1:01:21] got to go beyond the way Believing by
[1:01:22] the way things imagin or the way you're
[1:01:24] reasoning things amen faith is something
[1:01:27] you have to believe it's there that
[1:01:29] really nothing else will declare it's
[1:01:31] there but Faith see what is Faith he
[1:01:35] says it's an unseen foresee amen it's a
[1:01:39] spirit and the Holy Spirit brings Faith
[1:01:42] another place he said oh you claim you
[1:01:45] got faith but you know when Jesus
[1:01:47] becomes the Lord of your faith then all
[1:01:50] of his words become real to you when
[1:01:53] Jesus becomes the Lord of your Faith
[1:01:56] then all of his words become real to you
[1:02:01] another place when God takes the Holy
[1:02:03] Spirit and brings that word to you and
[1:02:06] makes it alive to you a reality that
[1:02:09] your faith amen stand up and claim it
[1:02:12] come on you say well I'm praying for a
[1:02:14] miracle when the word makes the reality
[1:02:17] oh come on when the word makes your
[1:02:20] faith a reality that's the time to stand
[1:02:23] up and to claim whatever God has made
[1:02:26] real to you you say well brother Andrew
[1:02:28] I can't see it that don't make no
[1:02:30] difference it don't have to be real in
[1:02:32] this visible realm if you can see it in
[1:02:35] the Unseen then God has the power to
[1:02:38] bring it into reality in the
[1:02:41] visible come on church amen when the
[1:02:43] prodical son come home that wasn't the
[1:02:46] that first day his daddy ever claimed he
[1:02:48] was coming home when he was down there
[1:02:50] in the big pin his daddy claimed he was
[1:02:52] coming home when his daddy couldn't seem
[1:02:54] back after father father's table his
[1:02:57] daddy still claimed he was coming home
[1:02:59] oh may I say to you tonight or this
[1:03:01] morning there is a faith seed in this
[1:03:04] bride of Christ we don't have to hear it
[1:03:07] we don't have to see it or feel it or
[1:03:08] smell it or reason it to believe it we
[1:03:11] are a part of Abraham's seed Hallelujah
[1:03:15] we believe it when our flesh is against
[1:03:17] us we believe it when our spirit is
[1:03:19] against us we believe that when things
[1:03:20] are against us we believe the things we
[1:03:23] don't see
[1:03:27] come on folks either you believe it or
[1:03:29] not either you believe it or not either
[1:03:32] somewhere you're going to say devil
[1:03:34] you've controlled me my My Five Senses
[1:03:36] long
[1:03:37] enough come on either we believe what a
[1:03:40] prophet said or we don't either we
[1:03:42] believe that we are controlled by a
[1:03:44] super sense which is the six sense or we
[1:03:47] don't but I believe we are I believe we
[1:03:50] are a little faith woman who believes
[1:03:53] God on the mountain and we believe him
[1:03:55] in the valley we believe him when the
[1:03:57] sun is shining and we believe him when
[1:03:59] the rain is falling we believe him when
[1:04:02] the clouds are gathering and we believe
[1:04:04] him when the birds are singing We are
[1:04:06] believers from our
[1:04:09] soul when God takes that holy spirit
[1:04:12] makes that word to you and makes it
[1:04:14] alive to you makes it a reality that
[1:04:16] your faith stand up and claim it listen
[1:04:19] to what he said you don't have to feel
[1:04:21] nothing you don't have to see nothing
[1:04:24] but you do have to believe something
[1:04:26] something now I'm just going to gohe and
[1:04:28] preach since I drove all the way out
[1:04:29] here you don't have to see nothing or
[1:04:32] feel nothing but you do have to believe
[1:04:34] something and I tell you right now and
[1:04:36] then these guys running around knocking
[1:04:38] Doctrine ought to be careful what
[1:04:40] they're opening the door to amen the day
[1:04:42] you start knocking the doctrine of this
[1:04:45] message is the day you open up the door
[1:04:47] to feelings and Sensations and emotions
[1:04:50] but this is one country preacher that
[1:04:52] will not quit preaching the doctrine of
[1:04:54] the restoration of the word of God in
[1:04:57] the age I'm living in because it's the
[1:04:59] only defense I have against the Demons
[1:05:02] of
[1:05:03] Hell somebody say we don't need doctrine
[1:05:05] well I tell you what we do need is we
[1:05:07] need something to Anchor Us in the time
[1:05:08] of confusion and our feelings ain't
[1:05:10] going to do it and our Sensations and
[1:05:12] emotions ain't going to do it folks it's
[1:05:14] going to take the word of God which is
[1:05:17] the absolute to this generation to
[1:05:19] Anchor the Church of the Living God you
[1:05:22] don't have to see nothing you don't have
[1:05:24] to feel nothing but you do have to
[1:05:26] believe
[1:05:27] something see what is Faith it is the
[1:05:30] evidence of Things Not Seen Bible says
[1:05:32] this by faith Noah being warned of God
[1:05:35] of things not seen as yet he moved with
[1:05:38] fear and he prepared an ark to the
[1:05:40] saving of his house by the which he
[1:05:43] condemned the world and he become the
[1:05:45] heir of righteousness which is by faith
[1:05:49] watch this the Bible said things not
[1:05:51] seen in the Amplified Bible that phrase
[1:05:54] Things Not Seen
[1:05:56] is actually
[1:05:57] translated notice this to events not yet
[1:06:02] seen so a thing not seen is an event not
[1:06:07] yet seen brother B says before there was
[1:06:08] a cloud before there was a drop of water
[1:06:11] in the skies amen Noah with the Unseen
[1:06:13] of the natural eye with his spiritual
[1:06:15] eye amen tuned to the word of God he's
[1:06:19] seen the rain fall falling oh tonight if
[1:06:22] we could get our hearts tune the word of
[1:06:23] God to see a Revival break forth to see
[1:06:26] the altars full to see the church packed
[1:06:29] to see the Revival spreading through Los
[1:06:31] Angeles a fire that cannot be put out
[1:06:34] our hearts would begin to pulsate under
[1:06:37] the power of the Holy Ghost he said
[1:06:39] there would be such a prayer meeting
[1:06:40] over Los anges amen it would have to
[1:06:43] happen certainly it would when this
[1:06:45] church is in tune what if the people
[1:06:48] here tonight that's sick would begin to
[1:06:50] think God is God and if he isn't want I
[1:06:53] serve him but if he's still God he still
[1:06:55] a Healer if he's almighty God he can do
[1:06:58] all things and if he made a promise he
[1:07:01] cannot break
[1:07:02] it he has to keep it then that pulsation
[1:07:06] begins to rise in your heart amen
[1:07:09] something is going to take place there
[1:07:11] could be nothing stop it see it's like a
[1:07:14] fire it's like a building on fire on a
[1:07:16] windy day it just keeps blowing as the
[1:07:19] Holy Spirit fanss the fire now listen
[1:07:22] and that fire keeps burning until
[1:07:26] it becomes a reality to you come on
[1:07:30] Church the fire of God has got to be
[1:07:32] ignited sometime in the soul of a
[1:07:34] Believer let me say this I think if we
[1:07:37] ever get the fire ignited we don't have
[1:07:39] to go back and reignite it we just got
[1:07:41] to maintain the fire that has been
[1:07:43] ignited you say how do I do that amen
[1:07:46] something has got to Fan the Flames
[1:07:48] every now and again amen something has
[1:07:50] got to keep the fire burning come on
[1:07:52] church I know it's easy to get cold it's
[1:07:55] easy to get in an indifferent condition
[1:07:57] listen we're
[1:07:59] humans well I might as well just preach
[1:08:02] we're humans and we go through things we
[1:08:04] go through trials and we go through
[1:08:06] disappointments we go through letdowns
[1:08:08] listen sometime or another you got to
[1:08:10] realize every mistake you made ain't
[1:08:12] taking you out every sometime you got to
[1:08:15] realize every failure and every ever
[1:08:17] ever ever stump of your toe you made
[1:08:19] it's not your end it's time to get up
[1:08:22] and dust yourself off and say I'm going
[1:08:24] to press on in the name of Jesus he said
[1:08:27] I was an overcomer he said I was an
[1:08:30] invincible Army he said I was a messiah
[1:08:33] he said I was a devil Slayer he said I
[1:08:36] was a serpent Bruiser he said I would
[1:08:38] put my foot on the head of every enemy
[1:08:41] and Bruise the devil under my heel
[1:08:42] shortly that's what he said and I
[1:08:45] believe what he said so I'm going to
[1:08:47] believe it when I don't feel it I'm
[1:08:48] going to believe it when I don't see it
[1:08:50] I'm going to believe it when I don't
[1:08:52] hear it because I am a believer from
[1:08:55] from my soul I believe in the authority
[1:08:59] of the word of
[1:09:01] faith Hallelujah therefore when we see
[1:09:03] promised in the Bible we believe it's
[1:09:05] soul body and spirit it's impossible for
[1:09:09] him to lie now if there's any fault if
[1:09:12] it's in us if there is it's in us it's
[1:09:15] not in God my goodness so then it's by
[1:09:20] the word of faith that we press remember
[1:09:23] said the word of faith which we preach
[1:09:25] love this we must preach the word of
[1:09:29] faith what Paul wrote to Timothy he said
[1:09:32] preach the
[1:09:33] word he said be instant in season out of
[1:09:36] season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:09:40] longsuffering and Doctrine let me just
[1:09:42] say what a prophet said he said I love
[1:09:44] to see God heal his children certainly
[1:09:46] don't get me wrong but one reason I've
[1:09:49] been notice and if you no this lately
[1:09:51] I've been trying everywhere I go when I
[1:09:53] get an invitation is to pray s to preach
[1:09:56] just a little bit I've let down on my
[1:10:00] preaching and it's putting too much on
[1:10:02] just the anointing and working on the
[1:10:05] Eternal part of the supernatural rather
[1:10:08] that when to see Visions now they're
[1:10:10] wonderful and I thank God for it how
[1:10:13] many thanks God for Visions amen you
[1:10:15] thank God for Visions how many believes
[1:10:17] in Visions we believing Visions see but
[1:10:20] watch yet the preaching of the word is a
[1:10:24] million miles beyond that brother wend
[1:10:27] the preaching of the word is a million
[1:10:30] miles Beyond SE and a vision he said see
[1:10:33] when I see the lame walk and the blind
[1:10:36] see now watch a prophet he said the
[1:10:39] success of the church amen lies within
[1:10:43] the preaching of the Gospel of the power
[1:10:45] of God and the demonstration of the
[1:10:48] spirit so the success of a church is not
[1:10:52] it's a it's not its a its ability to be
[1:10:54] known or its ability to grow or it's
[1:10:57] come on Church somebody say well the
[1:10:59] church ain't growing well let me say
[1:11:00] this growth is no sign amen that God is
[1:11:03] with the church or not because the
[1:11:05] prophet of God said prostitution went up
[1:11:07] amen 80% he said is god with
[1:11:10] prostitution absolutely not so we cannot
[1:11:13] let the devil amen narrow our vision
[1:11:16] down and just only see the way certain
[1:11:18] things are we've got to see the whole
[1:11:20] picture listen I'd rather have five
[1:11:22] people on fire with the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:25] the word being preached and demons being
[1:11:28] cast out and sick being healed and dead
[1:11:31] being raised and to have 500 Hypocrites
[1:11:33] you got to attend to every hour of your
[1:11:36] life come on folks this is the word of
[1:11:39] God the success of the church lies
[1:11:42] within the preaching of the Gospel I
[1:11:45] remember I remember I first started
[1:11:46] preaching that quote got me in trouble
[1:11:48] man I was preaching that preach the
[1:11:50] message preach the message and I went
[1:11:51] somewhere and I was preaching one day
[1:11:53] and I said a successful Church to me is
[1:11:55] a church that preaches the message well
[1:11:57] that was one of them come see me after
[1:11:59] service sermons you know amen Pastor
[1:12:00] want to talk to me and what he wanted to
[1:12:02] tell me was the success of his church
[1:12:05] was his visions and his Supernatural and
[1:12:07] his gifts and I said brother that's all
[1:12:09] well and good but a prophet right here
[1:12:11] said the success of the church amen lies
[1:12:15] within the preaching of the
[1:12:18] Gospel said it very beautiful he said so
[1:12:21] then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:12:24] by the word word of God faith cometh by
[1:12:27] hearing not by seeing a
[1:12:31] vision you say why do you say that
[1:12:33] because if you don't have faith if
[1:12:36] somebody will begin to preach the gospel
[1:12:38] the Bible said Faith cometh ain't that
[1:12:42] something if you don't have faith when
[1:12:44] the word begins to be preached Faith
[1:12:48] cometh he said see you can only serve
[1:12:50] God on Earth as it's God's servants that
[1:12:52] sent on Earth by divine inspiration
[1:12:55] interprets the word to you he said now
[1:12:58] watch therefore he sent anointed
[1:13:00] preachers to preach the word and you
[1:13:03] received it another place he said Christ
[1:13:05] does not anoint ministers to preach the
[1:13:07] gospel just to have it returned back to
[1:13:09] him void but he expects you to receive
[1:13:13] the word and in receiving the word he
[1:13:16] says be ready so as you receive the word
[1:13:20] you become the word that's why Jesus
[1:13:24] said in his last commission he said
[1:13:26] preach the gospel he said cast out
[1:13:28] devils in my name lay hands on the sick
[1:13:31] and they shall recover I know you know
[1:13:34] these things but can I just say it very
[1:13:35] plainly the preaching of the Gospel is
[1:13:39] the casting out of the devil you say
[1:13:42] really yes sir why not a vision because
[1:13:45] a vision could be an illusion and an
[1:13:48] illusion is connected to your
[1:13:50] imagination that's why we do not follow
[1:13:53] every life that shows up in a picture
[1:13:56] come on folks that's why we don't follow
[1:13:58] every Vision that's why we don't believe
[1:14:00] every man that says they had a
[1:14:01] conversation with the angel we have been
[1:14:03] given a year a folks we have been given
[1:14:06] a message and it's the message of the
[1:14:08] hour and everything we believe every
[1:14:11] step we make every turn we turn we judge
[1:14:14] it by the infallible word of the spoken
[1:14:16] God himself from the age that we're
[1:14:18] living in come on somebody say well I
[1:14:21] don't think imaginations are very
[1:14:22] powerful they're more powerful than you
[1:14:24] give them Authority for being they're
[1:14:26] more powerful than you give them credit
[1:14:28] am I might as well just preach it's here
[1:14:30] amen the preach of the Gospel is not an
[1:14:33] imagination it is the infallible word of
[1:14:36] almighty God and the devil can mess with
[1:14:39] your imagination but there is one thing
[1:14:41] he cannot Prevail over and that is the
[1:14:44] revelation of Jesus Christ that has been
[1:14:47] revealed in the hour that we're living
[1:14:49] in I know what I'm talking about
[1:14:52] imaginations run wild with people
[1:14:55] come on and I'll just say this
[1:14:57] imaginations become
[1:15:00] real but only to the person that has
[1:15:04] them you know what I'm talking about
[1:15:06] brother B said you imagine somebody
[1:15:07] don't like you and he said you'll start
[1:15:10] shunning them he said then you'll start
[1:15:12] ignoring them he said then before long
[1:15:15] you just are so convinced that they
[1:15:16] don't that that that they don't like you
[1:15:19] and he said see what's happened it's
[1:15:21] become real to
[1:15:23] you so that's like brother Kobe I get my
[1:15:26] mind you don't like me okay brother Kobe
[1:15:30] don't like me I shook his hand he didn't
[1:15:32] say nothing I S I told him he good did a
[1:15:34] good job lean singing he didn't even
[1:15:36] thank me he don't like me he don't like
[1:15:38] me that's one Sunday so let's go the
[1:15:41] next Sunday and the next Sunday I say oh
[1:15:43] brother Kobe he don't like me because
[1:15:45] today he looked at everybody in the
[1:15:46] crowd and said good morning he ignored
[1:15:49] me he don't like me so let's go a month
[1:15:52] out now okay now we're a month out Amen
[1:15:54] brother Kobe don't like me he don't like
[1:15:57] me he a he a he ain't even acknowledged
[1:15:59] me in a whole
[1:16:01] month come on Church brother Kobe don't
[1:16:04] like me now listen I've made that real
[1:16:07] to
[1:16:08] myself but you know why that brother
[1:16:11] Kobe is not believing that because it's
[1:16:13] not real to him it's real to me but it's
[1:16:17] not real to him and now watch folks when
[1:16:19] something becomes real to somebody and
[1:16:21] nobody else that's when they get mad oh
[1:16:24] God because it's real to them and nobody
[1:16:27] else and they start applying pressure
[1:16:29] and saying things and gossiping and
[1:16:30] calling and oh God I might as well
[1:16:32] preach are you hearing me what it is
[1:16:34] it's the power of imagination and when
[1:16:37] it becomes real to you it becomes so
[1:16:40] real that it's real to everybody in the
[1:16:41] church and in reality it's not real to
[1:16:45] nobody but
[1:16:49] you I've been there
[1:16:51] church have you been there it's real
[1:16:55] nobody but you that's why the gospel has
[1:16:58] got to be preached because it's the only
[1:17:00] thing that has the power and the
[1:17:03] authority to break that spirit and to
[1:17:05] cast it back into hell where it come
[1:17:07] from imagination won't do it it takes
[1:17:11] the word of God and if the word is not
[1:17:15] preached that devil will find a
[1:17:17] stronghold in every church every family
[1:17:20] every marriage every youth group come on
[1:17:22] folks I think it's time to draw our
[1:17:25] sword and say that devil will not live
[1:17:27] in my church he will not live in my
[1:17:30] family he oh Hallelujah he will not live
[1:17:33] in my marriage he will not live in our
[1:17:35] young people that devil of imagination
[1:17:37] will find this place this morning that's
[1:17:40] subject to the word of God and the
[1:17:42] authority of the Holy
[1:17:44] Ghost imaginations will run wild with
[1:17:47] you but the prod of God said see what
[1:17:48] we've got is we've got the power and the
[1:17:51] authority to break that spirit we have
[1:17:55] the power and the authority Amen to
[1:17:59] break that spirit so what does brother
[1:18:02] say he said the only thing God can do
[1:18:04] then is to shock you or to bring you to
[1:18:07] an understanding that he is still
[1:18:11] God and keeps his promise so in doing so
[1:18:16] he anoints preachers that's These Fine
[1:18:18] men standing around here and many back
[1:18:21] there he anoints them to preach
[1:18:25] yes sir he don't anoint them to feel I
[1:18:29] feel
[1:18:30] something ooh he don't anoint them to
[1:18:33] see oh I see I see he anoints them to
[1:18:38] preach now let me just say this the BR
[1:18:41] of God makes it very beautiful and and
[1:18:43] let me let me back up a second somebody
[1:18:45] say well I'm not going back down to that

[1:19:35] and he's a member of this church he's a
[1:19:37] faithful member he's here when you're
[1:19:39] not he's here when you let every excuse

[1:20:15] break out of the shell come on folks
[1:20:19] break out of the shell of the hour we're
[1:20:23] living in and the time and be conscience
[1:20:27] of the spirit of God that is now Among
[1:20:31] Us said very beautiful in St John 14 he
[1:20:34] reads it yet a little while and the
[1:20:36] world which is the unbeliever he seeth
[1:20:39] me no more but ye which is the believer
[1:20:41] see me because I which is Christ live ye
[1:20:45] shall live also he said listen to his
[1:20:49] going away low a little while in the
[1:20:51] world brother stops and says the visible
[1:20:56] intellectual cultured scientific the
[1:20:59] world will see me no more that's exactly
[1:21:02] a prophecy it can't help but be the
[1:21:04] truth Jesus Christ said it now watch he
[1:21:08] said I Christ in his church I love how
[1:21:11] brother BR makes this statement here I
[1:21:13] Christ in his church energizing bringing
[1:21:16] the same things that he did when he was
[1:21:19] here on Earth and by the way Kobe likes
[1:21:21] me and I like him as he did in all days
[1:21:24] G by he is in the church tonight to do
[1:21:27] the same thing another place and the
[1:21:29] Christ that sends the man goes with him
[1:21:32] and is in him see Jesus Christ in his
[1:21:35] church his branches energizing them
[1:21:39] bringing forth the same fruit he brought
[1:21:41] when he was here on the earth so when he
[1:21:44] come to the church in the last days he
[1:21:47] will come in the fullness of the light
[1:21:51] of the Sun so the god that sends the man
[1:21:54] go goes in the man and he goes in the
[1:21:56] man in the form of light see that's why
[1:21:59] the pro of God said this when you really
[1:22:02] realize amen that God has revealed to
[1:22:04] you the truth of the thing there is
[1:22:06] nothing in the world is going to defeat
[1:22:10] you in it amen that's all you are
[1:22:12] absolutely undefeatable not you but the
[1:22:16] god that's in you not Christ not the
[1:22:19] body but the word that was in him see
[1:22:22] not Mary but the word that was born from
[1:22:26] her okay when you really realize the
[1:22:30] truth of the thing it's not you it's the
[1:22:34] word that is in
[1:22:37] you how many knows there's times that
[1:22:39] God makes things so real to you you

[1:23:42] battling Parkinson's amen knows how to
[1:23:45] do war with that devil and what about

[1:23:50] party if you fallen in sin it's time to
[1:23:53] repent of the the thing and let the
[1:23:55] blood wash you clean but for the love of

[1:24:31] entrance amen it is an entrance P Peter
[1:24:34] said an entrance shall be
[1:24:38] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:24:41] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[1:24:43] Savior Jesus Christ you say what is an
[1:24:46] entrance an entrance is an exit as well
[1:24:49] now can I just be quite honest with you
[1:24:52] you got to leave some things Church
[1:24:55] yeah you're going to have to leave some
[1:24:57] things if you're going to go forward
[1:24:59] brother Miguel into what God has called
[1:25:01] you to go into to enter something you've
[1:25:04] got to exit something and brother said
[1:25:07] this he said the Believers are Kingdom
[1:25:10] people now watch here he said now let's
[1:25:12] now let's see someday amen I'm just
[1:25:14] going to take a moment read this he said
[1:25:16] this after this matter Matthew 6 after
[1:25:19] this manner therefore you pray ye Our
[1:25:21] Father which is in heaven art in heaven
[1:25:23] Hallowed be thy name watch what he says
[1:25:25] thy kingdom
[1:25:27] come thy will be done somebody say done
[1:25:31] thy will be done in earth and brother
[1:25:34] Kobe he didn't say on
[1:25:36] Earth he said in Earth what are you your
[1:25:41] Earth but the will of God would be done
[1:25:45] in your Earth listen as it is in heaven
[1:25:50] look at this word done it means come to
[1:25:52] pass it means be fulfilled now listen it
[1:25:56] means to be married
[1:25:58] to Oh Glory to God so there there there
[1:26:03] is a marriage taking place in your
[1:26:08] Earth brother said if he was called
[1:26:10] Messiah because he was anointed with the
[1:26:12] Holy Spirit and any church that Anointed
[1:26:14] with the same holy spirit is a messiah
[1:26:16] at a little or smaller God and someday
[1:26:20] when this body is resurrected I hope
[1:26:23] before for hand that God can get a hold
[1:26:26] of a bunch of people that will manifest
[1:26:28] his power in every Dimension that it's
[1:26:31] supposed to be in see Messiah anointed
[1:26:34] one a King to deliver you the Kings and
[1:26:37] Priests you are Kings to bring in you
[1:26:40] are preach to minister to a messiah and
[1:26:43] his signs was to follow in all ages
[1:26:46] reflecting his light his presence with
[1:26:49] his kingdom people come on you're not
[1:26:52] just citizens upon the Oklahoma folks
[1:26:54] you are Kingdom people you are Earth
[1:26:57] that has been redeemed by God and he has
[1:27:00] chose to

[1:27:06] place in your earth hallu oh God he said

[1:27:13] this he said let's turn our cameras this
[1:27:15] morning how many wants to turn your
[1:27:18] cameras he says and let's look on up
[1:27:21] yonder in
[1:27:22] heaven break out of this Dimension okay
[1:27:27] and look up
[1:27:31] yonder now we're all humans we have our
[1:27:35] good days we have our bad days we have
[1:27:39] our ups we have our downs we have our
[1:27:43] trials we have our situations our
[1:27:45] problems we go through
[1:27:48] things we're all

[1:27:54] coffee with
[1:27:57] angels well one person
[1:28:00] does and other days you feel like you're
[1:28:03] lower than a snake's
[1:28:06] belly we're
[1:28:08] human but here's the problem is when we
[1:28:11] get used to what's going on around
[1:28:14] us and it becomes so common that we
[1:28:17] forget there's something else happening
[1:28:19] somewhere
[1:28:23] else like I was over back in December I
[1:28:25] I just I'll just say this I was over in
[1:28:27] North Carolina preaching and I got hit

[1:31:25] it's rainy cloudy dreary cold dark got
[1:31:29] on the plane got my seat we took off I
[1:31:33] opened the window there's the rain
[1:31:35] there's the clouds there's the cold I
[1:31:37] just closed the window and I just settle
[1:31:40] down in my seat and we took
[1:31:44] off and we're flying and all of a sudden
[1:31:47] I start feeling a warmth I start feeling
[1:31:49] the warmth I said where in the world is
[1:31:51] that and I just looked over and I just
[1:31:53] barely open the open the window and I
[1:31:56] had to shut it real quick because the
[1:31:58] sunlight was so
[1:32:02] blinding I open that I open that window
[1:32:05] open that that that shade back up
[1:32:07] brother John and there was the
[1:32:10] sun five minutes ago I was ill I was
[1:32:14] bothered every little thing was getting
[1:32:16] on my nerves I had settled down it was
[1:32:18] always going to be this way but just a
[1:32:21] few seconds and it all changed
[1:32:24] are you hearing me just a few seconds
[1:32:26] and on the other side of the clouds the
[1:32:28] sun was still there come on that's why
[1:32:32] your imagination cannot be your absolute
[1:32:35] the way you feel cannot be your absolute
[1:32:37] the way you settle down to accept things
[1:32:39] that cannot become the absolute of your
[1:32:41] life you got to remember brother on the
[1:32:43] other side of the clouds the sun is
[1:32:46] shining the rain is dried up there's a
[1:32:49] new atmosphere oh New Life Outreach I
[1:32:52] say to you this morning it's time to
[1:32:54] rebuke them imaginations and remember
[1:32:57] who you are remember on the other side
[1:32:59] of this trial the sun is still shining
[1:33:03] Hallelujah he said we get so used to
[1:33:05] things down here listen what he says and
[1:33:08] when things look so dreary here
[1:33:12] on there's always something going
[1:33:16] on in Another
[1:33:21] World Church
[1:33:24] it's time to quit letting the devil beat
[1:33:26] you
[1:33:28] up listen the sphere of faith that other
[1:33:33] world is this okay that other dimension
[1:33:37] is under the Dominion of the six sense
[1:33:40] which only belongs to the Christian and
[1:33:43] it is superior to all other senses he
[1:33:47] said see the super sense is the holy
[1:33:49] spirit which is the faith of God that
[1:33:52] dwells in you and if you'll let the five
[1:33:55] senses be yielded to the six sense it'll
[1:33:57] guide you and bring all other five
[1:34:00] senses under control of that super sense
[1:34:04] for it is so far above the natural sense
[1:34:07] as the spiritual man is above the
[1:34:09] natural it is as far and as high as the
[1:34:11] heavens is above the natural man and his
[1:34:13] five senses now
[1:34:15] listen it makes you
[1:34:20] believe things that you cannot see it
[1:34:24] makes you act where you do not think the
[1:34:27] five senses would ever think about
[1:34:30] listen the devil can get into these five
[1:34:33] senses and lie to
[1:34:35] you but he cannot touch that super
[1:34:40] sense that's far beyond his reach see
[1:34:44] that come from God it's called faith and
[1:34:48] faith is that great thing so this six
[1:34:51] sense comes to make the five senses deny
[1:34:55] anything contrary to God's word God's
[1:34:57] promise see what Paul says he says
[1:35:00] casting
[1:35:01] down
[1:35:04] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:35:07] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:35:09] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:35:13] thought to The Obedience of Christ look
[1:35:16] at this word high thing it is a barrier
[1:35:19] or a rampart or a bullwark now what is
[1:35:22] knowledge is one of the virtue see
[1:35:25] knowledge of God is the revelation of
[1:35:27] God not a worldly knowledge but a
[1:35:30] Heavenly knowledge St perfect man then
[1:35:32] if you got Heavenly knowledge you
[1:35:34] believe the word and you reason anything
[1:35:37] by the word see when you catch that
[1:35:40] Revelation it's time to press beyond the
[1:35:44] barrier of circumstances it's time to
[1:35:46] press beyond the bullwark it's time to
[1:35:49] press beyond the rampart it's time to
[1:35:51] press beyond the hindrance see he he
[1:35:53] said oh look here amen them demons have
[1:35:56] to recognize what sphere you're entering
[1:36:00] into how many could say this morning
[1:36:02] Lord help me to change
[1:36:04] spars help me to change Realms help me
[1:36:08] to change Dimensions help me to move
[1:36:11] into a place in God where the five
[1:36:13] senses of inner and outer can no longer
[1:36:16] control me help me Lord now I'll just
[1:36:19] I'll just say this to you I love
[1:36:21] studying the discernments on tape how
[1:36:22] many enjoys those
[1:36:24] sometimes I'll sit there and listen to
[1:36:25] him and I'll watch him and read him and
[1:36:27] listen to him over and over and you know
[1:36:28] how the Lord is when you're studying
[1:36:30] brother when he'll start opening things
[1:36:31] to you and I was listening to one the
[1:36:32] other day and he says this in 1951 he
[1:36:35] says Thou Art here Lord and this devil
[1:36:38] knows his time has come he said to this
[1:36:42] woman now I I I know that we would take
[1:36:44] this and say well it's just one single
[1:36:46] woman sitting here on the plat for but
[1:36:48] but brother Bram said you're a little
[1:36:49] faith woman so is that okay if I make
[1:36:51] you this woman would that be all right
[1:36:54] to this woman entering into this sphere
[1:36:57] of Faith here oh God she's moving out of
[1:37:00] this sense bound existence into the
[1:37:02] sphere or the realm where faith is in
[1:37:05] control to this woman entering into this
[1:37:07] sphere of Faith here he knows he's got
[1:37:10] to lose he cannot hold her any longer
[1:37:14] now watch what he says Thou death Spirit
[1:37:17] come out of
[1:37:19] her in the name of Jesus Christ I charge
[1:37:24] thee to leave the woman now somebody say
[1:37:27] well brother Andrew how can you make
[1:37:29] that the bride and and it be a death
[1:37:31] spirit because do you realize a deaf
[1:37:33] Spirit does not just affect your
[1:37:36] hearing it also affects your speaking
[1:37:40] and you know what Paul said he said I
[1:37:42] have believed so therefore I speak so
[1:37:45] the way a Believer presses forward is by
[1:37:48] believing something and then speaking
[1:37:51] what they believe in the same Spirit of
[1:37:54] Faith they heard it him come on church
[1:37:57] she could hear he said thou death spirit
[1:37:59] so there is a connection between the
[1:38:01] hearing and the speaking it depends on
[1:38:04] if that now how many knows that de
[1:38:06] Spirit contacts a
[1:38:08] nerve and that death spirit will
[1:38:10] paralyze that nerve and you can hear
[1:38:13] something and still be deaf and not be
[1:38:15] able to speak come on folks I had a
[1:38:18] cousin bless her heart she was deaf she
[1:38:20] sit in the car ride with you all day
[1:38:21] long hear everything you said but she
[1:38:24] could not repeat it back to you she
[1:38:26] could not talk back to you she could not
[1:38:28] speak it back because she was deaf
[1:38:31] connected to her speaking can I say this
[1:38:33] to you that moves from the natural to
[1:38:35] the spiritual to this little faith woman
[1:38:38] sitting here do you realize there's a
[1:38:40] deaf spirit that wants to connect itself
[1:38:42] to every one of your spiritual ears he
[1:38:45] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:38:47] spirit is saying to the church do you
[1:38:50] realize the devil wants to connect his
[1:38:52] Spirit to your you're hearing so it will
[1:38:54] change the way you're speaking come on
[1:38:57] folks it'll change the way you're
[1:38:59] confessing things it'll CH come on Amen
[1:39:02] you know what a de Spirit can do it can
[1:39:04] it can change the way you hear things
[1:39:07] and make you say it differently than the
[1:39:08] way you heard
[1:39:10] it come on you know what I'm talking
[1:39:13] about somebody walk by and say good
[1:39:15] morning how are
[1:39:16] you if there's a death Spirit
[1:39:20] there well they insulted me no they
[1:39:22] didn't
[1:39:24] it's the way you heard it because there
[1:39:27] was something didn't want you to hear it
[1:39:29] the way they said
[1:39:30] it because they wanted to bring a
[1:39:33] disconnection between you and that
[1:39:34] person oh I guess it's just the
[1:39:37] Evangelist coming out they wanted to
[1:39:39] affect the way you was hearing but can I
[1:39:42] tell you what the prophet said he said
[1:39:44] thou deaf spirit I adure Thee to come
[1:39:46] out of her I'm not going to read it to
[1:39:48] you I'm GNA preach it to you you know
[1:39:50] what he said next he said if you can
[1:39:52] hear me then say
[1:39:55] Amen if you can hear me then say amen
[1:39:59] and that Death woman speaks out on tape
[1:40:02] and she says these words amen which was
[1:40:05] a sign she could now hear because what
[1:40:09] she was hearing she was now speaking and
[1:40:12] she was saying the same thing she was
[1:40:14] hearing hallelujah oh folks are you
[1:40:17] hearing me are you hearing me it's time
[1:40:20] to start listing them tapes again but
[1:40:22] without a de Spirit on your ear it's
[1:40:25] time to hear those tapes again but
[1:40:27] without something controlling the way
[1:40:30] you're hearing what a prophet saying I
[1:40:32] say thou de spirit I charge thee in the
[1:40:35] name of Jesus Christ take your hands off
[1:40:38] of this little faithful
[1:40:41] womanall let her
[1:40:43] hear Let Her hear the message the way
[1:40:48] God
[1:40:50] intended for her to hear it do you hear
[1:40:53] he me say
[1:40:56] amen sister repeats it amen say it again
[1:41:00] amen I love the Lord I love the Lord
[1:41:03] praise the Lord praise the Lord I love
[1:41:06] this one Jesus Loves
[1:41:09] Me Jesus loves
[1:41:12] me she could
[1:41:15] hear and the evidence she could hear
[1:41:18] well she could speak the same
[1:41:20] thing that she was hearing what about
[1:41:23] you this morning why don't you bring
[1:41:26] that
[1:41:27] imagination subject to the word of
[1:41:29] God why don't you bring that feeling
[1:41:33] subject to the word of God why don't you
[1:41:36] be like Joshua today as a musicians are
[1:41:38] coming 40 years later he had entered the
[1:41:40] promised land and being the great mil
[1:41:42] military General when the first battle
[1:41:44] his enemies had walled into a place when
[1:41:46] there was no way for him to get there to
[1:41:48] get them but by faith he looked at the
[1:41:50] Unseen because God gave Moses a promise
[1:41:53] promise while they were yet in Egypt I
[1:41:55] have given you all Palestine and by
[1:41:58] faith he saw the walls of Jericho laying
[1:42:01] flat on the
[1:42:03] ground brother brother Mitch those walls
[1:42:06] are still standing there still tall
[1:42:09] enough to have chariot races on but
[1:42:11] Joshua by
[1:42:14] faith he looked at those walls but he
[1:42:17] didn't see him
[1:42:18] standing he seen him
[1:42:21] falling and laying flat on the
[1:42:24] ground and he marched around in full
[1:42:28] armor with not one doubt in his heart
[1:42:31] but believing that God would do it and
[1:42:33] when the trumpet sounded and the people
[1:42:35] shouted the walls fell and they took the
[1:42:37] city why he seen the invisible one
[1:42:41] remember before he did this he was
[1:42:43] walking one afternoon and he seen a man
[1:42:44] who was standing against the wall with
[1:42:46] his sword drawn and Joshua draw his
[1:42:48] sword and went to meet him and he said
[1:42:51] are you for us or are you for the enemy
[1:42:53] and the man spoke back and Saidi am the
[1:42:55] captain of the host of the Lord I love
[1:42:59] these next words Joshua knowed the
[1:43:03] battle belonged to him
[1:43:07] then when he met and seen the invisible
[1:43:11] one sister Carol there was a revelation
[1:43:14] dropped in his soul this
[1:43:17] battle belongs to me
[1:43:20] now I hadn't swung one sword I ain't

[1:53:42] hallelujah
[1:53:44] hallelujah uh I was I was just reading a
[1:53:46] quote this
[1:53:48] morning it was right up above the quote
[1:53:50] that I had that I had
[1:53:53] posted and he's and and brother brandom
[1:53:56] M said well how could Jesus
[1:53:59] overcome the things that he
[1:54:02] did he said because he had a
[1:54:05] predestinated
[1:54:06] heart then a couple paragraphs down and
[1:54:09] he says and how is it that Christ is
[1:54:12] going to manifest
[1:54:14] himself through his Earthly church
[1:54:17] because we are predestined to it
[1:54:23] we're ordained to see
[1:54:25] that oh my there is something within us
[1:54:29] as I must press there's something says I
[1:54:33] must receive the Holy Ghost there's
[1:54:35] something says I must go beyond form
[1:54:37] there's something that says I want that
[1:54:40] world to control me I want Christ to
[1:54:46] have preeminence in
[1:54:47] me that way nothing of this world Amen
[1:54:54] amen amen did you enjoy the word of the
[1:54:57] Lord tonight

[1:56:13] couples amen sister Mary says don't call
[1:56:16] me an elder amen and uh uh but you for
[1:56:21] for the couples and and from our heart
[1:56:24] we we just want you know a pastor can
[1:56:28] have a
[1:56:31] vision but if others don't see that
[1:56:33] Vision it it
[1:56:36] really but I'm here to tell you this
[1:56:39] this is this was wonderful last year and
[1:56:43] this year was just it's exactly what
[1:56:46] I've envisioned and what I long to see
[1:56:48] and I say thank you to you sister
[1:56:52] sisters who put this
[1:56:59] on and then all of the helpers were I I
[1:57:02] know it required more than just the four
[1:57:04] of them and the young people coming in
[1:57:07] on that Friday night uh Friday to help
[1:57:11] and um uh put to to help put all those
[1:57:15] things and we say God bless you these
[1:57:18] the ladies were bragging on you young
[1:57:20] people saying we appreciated the ones
[1:57:22] who came out and worked and to to make
[1:57:25] that so
[1:57:30] wonderful and and then and and then um
[1:57:34] the couples that stayed last night the
[1:57:37] these these ladies would probably still
[1:57:39] be over there taking all those
[1:57:40] decorations down if it hadn't been for
[1:57:44] for those who willingly stayed behind to
[1:57:47] to put things up and not
[1:57:49] just throw things around you were
[1:57:51] folding things and putting them where
[1:57:53] they belonged and it was just I just say
[1:57:55] the whole evening was
[1:57:57] wonderful most importantly I appreciate
[1:58:01] every one of
[1:58:03] you that takes advantage of of of these
[1:58:07] things if God gives a a
[1:58:09] vision and then the people don't
[1:58:11] appreciate it and don't attend to it and
[1:58:14] don't don't want to be a part of it it
[1:58:16] it just it sort of puts a damper it just
[1:58:18] hurts and that goes for whether it be
[1:58:20] the youth leader or or whether it be
[1:58:23] Sunday schools or whether it be you know
[1:58:26] these others but I I'm glad that we can
