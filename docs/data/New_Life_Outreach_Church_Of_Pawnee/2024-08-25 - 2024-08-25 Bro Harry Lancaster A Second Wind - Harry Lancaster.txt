you that have your Bibles with you let's go ahead and go into the word we're going to go to 1 Corinthians chapter 9 1 Corinthians chapter 9 and we'll start at verse 24 know ye not that they which run in a r run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainty so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast pass away let's go ahead and go before the Lord Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord I pray that you would just be the one to to take control of this service Lord Jesus we lord we've we've worshiped you and praised you Lord and Lord though as far less than what you would deserve Lord I pray that you would accept those those those songs and the worship Lord Jesus and Lord may you just come down and and minister to your people Lord they Lord they've come with expectation Lord that that you would have something to to say to each one of them and Lord they didn't come to to hear me or hear any particular man that would be standing behind this Pulpit Lord but they came to hear you Lord and Lord I pray that you would just be the one to to take control Lord that you would Lord put together these these jumbled notes and jumbled thoughts Lord and Lord may you be the one to to speak and minister to every one of us Lord myself included Lord we just commit the remainder of the service into your hands in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may all have your seats so we have all probably heard multiple sermons preached over the years about the Christian life being erase and I'm sure there are going to be plenty of things that I would say that you've heard before at this point so many of you know at this point we've read through these scriptures so many times that I shouldn't be telling you a whole lot that's new U maybe it's just trying to bring back to our memory some of the the things that we've read or that we've heard over the years but you know I started thinking about this and um it just so happened that it coincided with the fact that you know we just had the Olympics complete and you had all of these athletes that were gathering together to uh comp compete for their country to try to win these these races and you know I've always found it interesting that there there're really two different types of Runners you know when you look in um they look majorly different you know you have the one group of runter that they're the sprinters yeah they do the short distance they do it so quickly and if you look at any one of them they all look like they have been hitting the weight bench a lot they're all really big beefy guys they have lots of muscles and you can even go down from to the the the physical side the medical side they have more fast twitch muscles they are designed for Speed this is this is what they're able to do and this is what they have maximized where if you watch the runners that are distance Runners those that are running 5,000 m 10,000 M marathoners all this they are lean they are skinny they look like they have no extra fat no extra muscle anywhere on their body they're as close to Skin and Bones as you can get and still be healthy and they are just so lean but they can go and go and go and those sprinters might be able to get out fast but if you have to go a distance the sprinters aren't going to get there yeah they're going to fall off pretty quick they can cover their their short distance but they're not going to keep going but these these lean guys that have worked off everything else just keep going and they have these slow twitch muscles that allow them to to go through the the distance that they're not always the fastest Off the Mark they're not always going to have the the best start but they're going to keep going and they're going to finish well at the end yeah where with the sprinters yes they it's all about in winning a Sprint a lot so much it's about that good start did you take off really well were you able to get a good push off the block or did you have this good starting position because that start is what often will make or break the race where with the distant Runners if you fall down in the first 100 feet it really doesn't matter you can get right back up you're going to keep going you're going miles yeah so falling in a couple hundred feet is not going to affect you a whole lot tripping stumbling these different things they're not going to greatly affect the marathon or they're not going to greatly affect the one that is Going the Distance yeah because they have time to recover they have time to keep going they have time to keep pushing through it let's go to Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus for these distance Runners if they fall if they stumble if they trip if they whatever they're not going to get up and spend the entire rest of the race beating themselves up and going how in the world could I have stumbled there okay okay cuz there's time to recover there's time for them to keep coming if they spend all their time thinking about I can't believe I stumbled in the first 50 fet or in the first 100 ft it's not going to help them as they're going towards the end they have to lay aside any thoughts of well maybe I didn't start quite as fast as I wanted or maybe I did this wrong or did that wrong they're focused on where they're going they're focused on what the uh what the finish line is they're focused on the end result now that doesn't mean that they don't kick themselves because they did trip or stumble or whatever but they have to quickly lay it aside and be focused on this is where I'm going and when they're out there running these are not once again these are not you have this huge difference in races on the ones that are doing the sprinting these are races that are done in seconds or minutes where this other one these are races that are done in hours we're talking you know when you look at the times for marathons 3 hours 4 hours is a more normal time you can get the really competitive guys that go faster than that but 3 to four hours and they normally have cut offs at somewhere around 6 to seven hours if you go beyond that you're not finishing they're cutting you off because they have to get the roads back open on but they do this is for hours and so a momentary mess up of a few seconds is not going to throw everything out of proportion okay if you ever watch video of people finishing marathons it's normally not whoever's finishing out in front there's normally not a group of them together there is normally large gaps between people that are finishing you may have a small group of okay here was two that came together or three that came together but generally these are huge large distances between people and so these momentary changes these momentary mistakes or mess ups they may have had didn't have a huge effect for the end What mattered was whether they kept going whether they kept running whether they kept their focus on the goal that they were going to let's go to Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrews chap 12 and verse 1 wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us one run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God brother brandom as he's praying in the sermon perfect strength by Perfect weakness he says our gracious loving father we humbly approach thy Throne this morning in the name of Jesus thy son to offer prayer for ourselves and for others thou would first Lord forgive us of all of our trespasses and our iniquity and then we would pray for others Lord that they also would be forgiven and thy Church would be drawn closer to thee for truly Lord in our heart we believe that you are ready to work a work with with your church ready to take it out of the world and be translated into the kingdom of God but Lord help us make ourselves ready for that hour may this morning be the time Lord that from one up to all of us will lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that's set before us Lord Romans 12 starting at verse one it says I beseech you therefore bre by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so Paul as he's writing to the Hebrews is saying lay aside every weight lay aside all the sin and everything that would hold you up that would slow you down that would weigh you down that would keep you from covering the distance that you're going through and then he says as he's writing to the Romans be not conformed to this world okay you know we have a world where normally the mindset is to gather as much stuff as you can to have as many things as many it's now I mean it's hit to the point now where people that are trying to do different and do what's called minimalist living is like this is a thing people follow this people have to learn how to do this how can I live like a minimalist it's a short answer get rid of stuff I mean there shouldn't be something that they have to do lessons for minimal means less go in your closet throw out some clothes we're moving in the right direction you know get rid of some of the toys that you haven't touched for however long or the tools that have been in your garage for who knows how long that you bought for a single project and is now there Gathering dust or get rid of this or get rid of that but you can go on and you can find articles all over the internet you can find books written about how to live a minimalist life yeah this is what you have to do yeah this should be pretty basic this should be pretty easy but we live in a world where everything is about how do I get more how do I get more things more stuff more popularity more wealth more this more that okay we live in the world where buffets were the biggest thing in the world until Co but until then it was all about how do I get more I want to go to the restaurant that gives me the biggest portions I want to go to the restaurant that gives me the most food I want to go to the place that gives me the most of whatever I'm getting I don't and so often it's I really don't care if it's a little bit less quality as long as there's more of it we're okay this is good it's just more yeah that's the mindset that's the world that we live in it's all about more and all too often we can allow that to creep into our spiritual lives as well to go okay more is always better and so what if I learn from this resource and this resource and this resource why is it that we have to have message ministers that are up here telling us we don't need to pay atten pay attention to what Dr Dobson says or we don't have to pay attention to this or pay attention to that because we're in this more mentality okay so if there's somebody that is Christian that is talking about a subject then I should probably listen to what they have to say I should read their book I should listen to their podcast I should do this I should do that I should have more I'm not going to say that you can't get something good out of what they have to say there are probably lessons that we could take from Dr Dobson that are fine I'm not saying he's telling you evil things I'm not saying any of these people out there are telling you things that are absolutely wrong but so often we have that more mentality of well yes I listen to my pastor and maybe I listen to a message this month but I'm going to make sure I listen to this podcast every day I'm listen to this person every day or listen to that or listen to that or read this book or do this and I'm going to fill everything up right and it's more and it's this more mentality but yet Paul is telling us we have to lay aside the weights okay yes and yes he goes he then specifically says and the sin that so easily besets but he doesn't start off by just saying lay aside the sin he's like lay aside the weight there are things that start to cling to you that are just start to be noise that just start to be things that true they might not be bad but they're distractions we all know our human brains Can Only Hold so much we start to forget things we start to not be able to remember this because we're trying so so focused on trying to remember remember this and as we go through we fill our minds with all these kinds of things you know whether it's for me I've done a lot of I've listened to read a lot of books and listen a lot of things about leadership within the Chick-fil-A world because Chick-fil-A is really big on leadership and being able to work with your teams and different things and so I've read books by different people I've listened to podcasts I do this I do that and I can learn a lot of Leadership Lessons and they're good there's nothing bad about them but it's easy to start getting the point where I'm remembering more of that and less of the scriptures or less of what the prophet said yes and the Leadership Lessons From these great speakers are not going to be the things that get me into heaven they're not going to be the things that help me overcome the struggles I have in my life they're not going to be the things that help me get through life it may help me be successful in my job it may help me be successful working with the people that I have there but is it going to help me in the more important things is it going to help me actually do the other stuff to conform is to be similar in form or type to agree and we're Paul tells us that we are not to be conformed to the world we are supposed to be standing out we're supposed to be different same thing as when you're looking at these two different types of Runners to use this as the type I would say that most of the world are sprinters in this that they're all about they're going to get bulked up they're going to be able to do things fast in a short distance but yet God is calling us to be the marathoners God is calling us to be the distance Runners God is calling us to be able to keep going and keep pushing and there are two different mindsets there two different ways of training there are two different ways of eating there are two different ways of living you're not going to find the sprinters and the marathoners in the gym together you're not going to find them out on the track training together you're not normally not even going to find them like at the same restaurants they're going for different they have different needs because of what they're trying to accomplish okay right the world is out to get everything they can right now to get all the enjoyment they can right now where we have the goal to get somewhere else our goal isn't to gain everything we can right now and be able to enjoy every moment we have here on this Earth our goal is to get to heaven our goal is to get to our Savior our goal is to get out of this world and so we're not trying to gather everything we can here we're not trying to bulk up with the world's vitamins and the world's minerals we're trying to do a different diet we're trying to go for a different Target they're looking at a Finish Line that to them is the end of a lifetime we're looking at a finish line that goes beyond our life time when you look at what the world focuses on and pays attention to there was a Gallup poll in 2022 that showed a record low 20% of Americans now say the Bible is the literal word of God which is down from 24% when the question was last asked in 2017 when the poll breaks down you have basically three answers you have 20% of those polled say that the Bible is the literal word of God you have 29% that say the Bible is just a collection of fables Legends history and moral precepts recorded by man and then you have the largest group 49% that say the Bible is inspired by God but not to be taken literally in Time magazine in February of this year in an article written by Emily bisos says people are tired like really tired as evidenced by recent Trends such as quiet quitting coffee badging bare minimum Mondays and most of all the great resignation when over 47 million Americans voluntary voluntarily resigned from their positions people are feeling a strain on more than just their work calendars they're feeling it on their Spirits we're now in the area of we're now in the era of the great exhaustion what writer and computer science Professor Cal Newton has called a time when people are looking to reestablish their relationship with work in order to reduce their pervasive sense of drain in the article she goes on to list three main reasons why people are tired the first one is unsustainable Lifestyles the second reason is stress that is out of their control and the third is financial insecurity I work with some of these people that I guarantee would have given the exact same answers because there are a few people that I go to work and every single day when I ask him hey how you doing their immediate answer is tired the day just started I mean I'm getting there at 7 in the morning yeah and I understand some days 7 in the morning is rough other days it's fine but there's some days where I can go okay I understand being tired but this is the same shift you work every day surely there's a point where your body starts to go okay this is normal but their answer never changes I've been working with them for a year or more now and it's still the same yeah every single day how you doing today tired there have been a few days where I went in and I went brother Coe how you doing today and before he could even answer tired I just answer for him CU I know what's coming I know what they're going to say we live in a world where people are tired they are worn out they are stressed they are unsure of what's going to happen next and to me this is one of the places where the Christian Life should be standing out as a witness sure there are going to be days where we are tired we didn't sleep well hey I've got a baby and a toddler that have decided to get their sleep schedules all messed up in the past month or so there are days I am tired I know there are lots of days my wife is tired she has to deal with them more than I do but there there's it's we're going through a season and there is a reason to be tired there's a physical reason we're not getting as much sleep as we're used to yeah so we're tired okay they will grow out of this the season will end yeah we will get out of and even now there's a good day or a good night where they slept well and the next morning we're not as tired we're okay we're good but it's still it's a season it's not something where for the rest of my life I don't continually always say I'm tired but yet people all around us are tired they are continually stressed they were continually upset and as Christians we're not in that place yes we may go through a season we have different ones as we were as we were praying over them this morning the different ones that have been battling sickness or dealing with these different things they're going through Seasons where even spiritually I guarantee they are feeling tired sister Denise has been battling this high blood pressure for some time this has been going on and where physically she's tired but I'm sure that there's some emotional and spiritual draining to where she feels tired because of this she's been going through things we can look at brother Duran as he goes through and he has the days where he's more weary more tired his body isn't wanting to work the way that he wants it to he's struggling with these different things brother Mitch has been struggling with his own things there are days where he's tired and not just physically I'm sure there are days where he feels it emotionally and feels it spiritually where it comes on more and he has this going on and we live in a world where their answer for almost all of this is to find some way to numb the tiredness it's one of the reasons that people will turn to alcohol or people will turn to different drugs even the ones that they now want to call is okay this is medically okay you can do the the medical marijuana it's not too bad and you know and they'll go into all the debates about it doesn't lead into anything else doesn't do whatever I'm not even going to try to argue that that's fine but what it does do is it gets you used to being numbed it gets you used to not having to feel the pain or not have to feel the stress or not have to feel the problems and that's where the danger comes in because Satan is all about trying to get you to be numb and not feel it you know when you have Runners that are that are training it's actually dangerous for them often to take pain medication because if they are continuing to train while using the pain medication they can often hurt themselves worse because they're not feeling it for particularly those that are doing distance running or these more extreme type of sports if they take anything they want to take the lightest possible just to take the edge off because they need to still feel how their body is responding they need to know as they're running if that knee is starting to give out so that they can stop before they do further damage or if that tendon or that muscle or that whatever they can't just be popping I'm going to take all the pain pills in the world just so I can keep going they have to keep feeling it or they're going to do more damage to themselves they're going to hurt themselves more but the world doesn't like hearing that they don't like hearing that hey we have to sometimes feel some struggles we have to feel some pain and so we live in a world that they want to automatically numb everything they want to take the route even if it's the mind-numbing route of I'm going to watch TV or scroll Facebook or Instagram or whatever and spend hours and hours doing it yeah yeah I saw the term a month or two back for the first time that I'd ever heard it and it applies to these different social media channels and it's called Doom scrolling and especially applies to the different social medias that have very short video clips it came out with Tik Tok to begin with but now you have Instagram and Facebook that all have the same kind of thing and doom scrolling is where you start off watching this one 30 second video or minute long or whatever it is and you scroll to the next one and then scroll to the next one and scroll to the next one and where a person wouldn't have given the wouldn't have taken the time to watch a 30 minute or hourong video they find themselves spending even more time stuck in the Doom scrolling right where they wouldn't have gone oh yeah I don't I'm not going to spend an hour on my phone I wouldn't sit here and watch this whole hourong video but they'll sit there and doom scroll short video clips over and over and over which will then become hours and hours okay and there'll be videos of all kinds of stuff so you can't even say I was focused on one subject and I learned something or did whatever it's you know however the algorithm randomizes it that's what they just watched for an hour or whatever yeah and just the name behind it should immediately put everyone on guard it's called Doom scrolling you are stuck in a circle of Doom That Never Ends it's not like okay I watched a 30- minute video there is a beginning and an ending I'm done with this Doom scrolling the algorithm keeps feeding you more it's not going to go at 30 minutes ah you're done I'm cutting you off you're finished it's like oh you want to flip to another one great here's the next one for you here's the next one for you here's the next one and just keep filling up the time keep in you to what's going on around because you're distracted and focused on these other things Galatians 5 and: 7 ye did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth you did run well you started well you got off the block quickly you were moving down but then something stopped you something hindered you something kept you from continuing down the road and there's some sort of weight that you picked up along the way or maybe that you had from the beginning that you just forgot to drop or whatever but something came along and kept you from going down the road the way that you should and maybe that was just we started going through a tough season dealing with whatever issue may be coming on whatever battle the devil threw at us to go through right now some struggle some test or trial that came along that's making us stumble a little bit or making us feel like we have a little more weight to carry where and it's pushing us towards that tired part we're not always you know what what hinders us is not automatically that there's sin yes there could be and yes you need to check up to see is there something I need to get rid of but it could also be you're just going through a rough time in your life you're going through a test you're going through a trial and that is hindering you it's like running through mud you can keep moving or running on the sand on the beach used to live in Florida I've done that a few times it's not fun not enjoyable at all not unless you get down right by the water where it's packed in nice then you can do something but in the just nice grainy sand I have zero desire to run in that but something is going on that is that is hindering you that is slowing you down that is slowing down the progress okay Galatians chapter 6 and verse 9 let us not be weary and well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith and 2 Thessalonians 3 and: 13 says the the same thing but ye Brethren be not weary in well-doing in the sermon what does thou hear brother brandom says you know people under the juniper tree is like Elijah they like to sleep I preach to more tired people than anybody in the world people are so tired they they're so mentally strained until they're filling the insane institutions in the hospitals everywhere they went in such a nervous condition until they don't know what they do believe and what they want they're just laying there they don't know what to do oh it's such a sad sight listen here my brother you can't drink it off you can't shout it off neither can you play cards till it's dull you could take a thousand csas and try to sleep it off and you can't do it all of our little remedies only thing it does is help the symptoms we've got to have a cure for the disease we got to have all the psychiatrists in the world cannot cure it it only helps the symptoms okay the Cure is in the blood of Jesus Christ not take a rest at the seashore not go get an Anthem acquire to sing anthems that's what we're trying to do today sing it off and in the sermon the testimony of a true witness brother brandom says heal the sick that's in our midst this morning for we realize Lord that a tired weary sick body dragging around cannot enjoy the blessings of God as they could if they were well and we realize as Christians that we live so far under our privileges that you do not desire us to be like that tired and weary and run down and weakening you desire us to be filled with the spirit of God grant that to us Lord as we wait further for your message in Jesus name we ask it amen you know they can write their articles today talking about how there people are more tired than ever before in America but yet our Prophet already said it said I preach to more tired people than ever before this isn't something new even though the world is now diagnosing it as this is new this is different this is just part of going through life you know when you look at distance Runners they don't get to the end of the marathon and then stand there breathing easy like they've done done nothing even the best in the world when they get to the end of a distance Marathon a lot of them almost fall over when they get past the end this is not you know what people would say is light work or something this is an effort this is a strain it takes a lot to accomplish this kind of goal right so many people in the world will put this on their bucket list type thing of I'm going to complete a marathon one day this is what I'm going to do because this is a major achievement if I was able to run that far and complete it under the time prescribed I have done something I have accomplished something and in any type of Sport AS athletes are training as they are working as they're going through this they will be getting more and more tired their body will be their muscles will be burning their body will be screaming at them it's time to stop their lungs will start burning they won't be able to get they'll feel like they can't get enough air in their sweat pouring out and there's just their body is going what are you doing to me why are we doing this and it's screaming at them to stop but there's this F phenomenon that's known of in Endurance Sports It's called The Second Wind and this is a phenomenon whereby an athlete who is out of breath and too tired to continue sometimes known as hitting the wall somehow finds the strength to press on at top performance with less exertion documented experiences of the second wind go back at least a 100 years when it was taken to be a commonly held fact of exercise the phenomenon has even come to be used as a metaphor for continuing on with Renewed Energy past the point thought to be one's Prime whether in Sports careers or life in general I'm sure we've all heard the term before the second wind and we've heard it used in conversation some of the guys that like to exercise maybe they've even experienced it pushing past that wall to be able to keep going and it's interesting when you start to look up about the second wind that doctors don't even know what it is there are theories as to what the second wind is but even an article I read by the Mayo Clinic gave three or four different possibilities of what it could be that allowed the second win to H happen but they didn't know for sure now they even one of the things they put in multiple medical things I didn't write them down I'm not even going to try to do something about the way your body Burns energy when it switches to a different energy source all this kind of stuff they have these thoughts on this is what's going on your body is making the switch from one source to another that's when you're hitting the wall and once the other energy source kicks in you get your second wind they have some other ideas and these different things and they even have one where it's all a mental thing you get the second win because you realize you're like over halfway towards the goal you were going for they'll find it a lot they said they find it a lot of times with Runners once they pass that halfway mark to where they go there is less in front of me than what's behind they can get get that second wind to keep going now whether it's purely mental whether it's physical in the way that God created our bodies I don't know there are even some doctors that say oh it's all Placebo it's not real people that's why it's it's all in the mind people think this is happening but it's actually not happening yeah um don't know I'm not a scientist I don't want to read enough health articles to figure this out this is not everything I found the doctors didn't know so I'm not going to try to figure it out myself but yeah we all know the term second win and we all know the mindset of pushing yourself to the point where you're so tired but yet somehow finding the energy to keep going on somehow finding the energy to make it past what you're trying to overcome Isaiah chter 40 and verse 30 even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint God promises us a second wind if we wait on the Lord if we are continuing to push forward in the way that we're supposed to if we're willing to keep going go all right Lord I don't know how I'm going to get through this I don't know how I'm going to even put my foot down to take the next step but I'm trusting you I don't know how we're going to get past this I don't know how we're going to get past this barrier I don't know how we're going to get past the wall I have hit the wall I don't know how it's coming down I don't know what we're doing but Lord I'm going to keep pressing I'm going to keep going forward it says even you shall faint and be weary even the athletes even the the ones who have all the energy that can run around all over the place even they're going to get tired they're going to get weary the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength you're going to keep pressing you're going to keep pushing forward because we're keeping our eye on the Finish Line that's up ahead we're not trying to finish the short race that the world's going for we're trying we're here for the long game we have the long goal out in front of us and that's what we're going to keep going for whether that's means we're slogging through some mud whether that means we're going across the Sandy terrain that you hate running on we're going to keep pressing forward because the Lord has given us a Finish Line that's way out in the distance or at least it was way out in the distance when we started we know that that Finish Line keeps getting closer and closer bless the Lord hallelujah and the Lord has said I'm going to renew your strength you'll go through those Seasons where you are tired you're going to go through the time where you're facing these trials you're facing the troubles and you're not sure how you're going to make it whether that's because of your own physical health issues whether that's because of trials that are going on around you whether that's because of some kind of loss that's been experienced yeah we're going through this tough time and the Lord has said if you'll wait on me another way of saying if you'll trust in me yes then I will renew your strength I will restore you I will lift you back up I will keep you going maybe you stumbled maybe you fell but it's not a Sprint you fall on a Sprint it's over you've lost it's done by the time you stand back up they've already finished it's over but this is a distance race we're going for a while and you're going to hit that point hey I'm hitting the wall my muscles are getting tired and I stumbled I tripped I lost my gate for a minute but that doesn't mean I stop running it doesn't mean that I sit to the side and go throw up my hands I'm done I tripped okay you tripped if you're trying to finish the marathon if you're trying to finish the distance running you can still keep going there's room to recover and there's a Lord that promised to renew your strength prise the Lord praise the Lord Brother brandom said in the sermon as the eagle stirreth up her nest the eagle is supposed to be a bird that renews his youth every so often no matter how old he is turns back to a young bird again not in years but in physical makeup he renews his youth the Bible say said he did thou will renew his youth like the eagle what a beautiful type it is of the church when we're weary worn torn about to go in and renew our strength and mount up like the eagle above all of our cares and Fashions and things of this world acts 4 and: 31 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness Acts 2 they had already been filled Acts 2 they received the Holy Ghost and they went out speaking in tongues acts 4 the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost this was not a new group this was not a different set of people these were the same individuals that had been in the upper room two chapters before yeah yeah and they came down and they had already been through some trials Peter had just come out of being in front of the San hedrin and being lectured and told never to speak again all these kinds of things and so the Lord was like all right it's time for a fresh anointing it's time to renew some strength to keep them going they weren't in the depths of Despair or anything they were just praying if you read through the chapter Peter wasn't even wasn't upset that he had been hauled in he was he was celebrating he was good with this and the Lord still was like great we'll give you a refilling let's keep this going let's make sure that you have strength for the next step let's make sure you have strength for what's coming now and when we live in a world that's so focused on let me gather as much stuff as I can and then the results are that there are more people tired than ever you can't tell me these aren't related that people have more stuff more things to think about more things to be worried about and they're now more tired and Paul tells us lay aside the weight and the sin that do so easily beset us you've got a ways to go we've got a distance only take what's necessary praise the Lord only take what's important you know if you're being in Florida I've been in some areas where they had to have an evacuation Zone because of hurricane was coming when you're evacuating you're only supposed to be taking what's necessary you're supposed to take what is most important and if you lose the rest it's okay but it's when you're in an evacuation situation it's just take the important things if you if there are any documents that you have to have make sure you've got those maybe grab picture albums that you don't want to lose that kind of thing but don't oh man I've got to make sure that I took my newest computer that I just bought or I've got this or I've got that no don't weigh yourself down with a whole bunch of this stuff just take make sure you've got some clothes make sure you've got some food and resources but you just take what's important when you're running a race you don't want to be hauling everything in the world with you when you look at how any of these guys dress when they're going to a race none of them are carrying backpacks not a one if there's someone carrying a backpack he probably shouldn't be in the race pretty simple they are not carrying anything extra yeah they just have have the clothes they're wearing normally with these kind of Races they don't even have to worry about carrying water cuz there's water spots set all along the race so I don't even have to carry a bottle with me I just run and I grab water as I go past drink and throw the cup on the ground that's it I don't need to carry snacks I don't need to carry this or that I'm just here to run and God put us in this life and you have to take only what's necessary okay yes God has called us to live here we have a life that is erased so we have to have a way to provide we have to be able to have food we have to be able to have certain things there are certain things that are Necessities I'm not saying sell everything you have and go live up on a hill we're not doing that but at the same time we're not in the mindset of I'm trying to accumulate as much as I can that's the world's mindset that's what their goal is their goal is to get out and be able to show I am so important because I have so much stuff and I have the fanciest car I have the best uh Nintendo system or whatever that's the world mindset we're not out to show that we're something special because we own this or we have that we are living a life that's different we're not supposed to be we're not caught up in the same things as the world we live with a different purpose we live with a different mindset we live with a different Target a different Finish Line the world is living with one target they're sprinting they're out to get there as fast as they can with as much as they can God is calling us to run a different kind of race God is calling us to live a different kind of way yes and everyone we rub shoulders with is living with a different mindset with living with a different race than we are all right it's the best way that I can explain it they're running A different race they're playing a different game they're doing a completely different task it looks like we're all living the same life because we're all here in this world they're wearing clothes like we are they're going to a job like we are they're doing this they're doing that but they have a completely different purpose they have a completely different goal they have a completely different Target and we're going to go through things in life that gets us tired we're going to go through things in life in a world that is built around weariness anymore it seems like where everyone is tired everyone is struggling everyone is stressed or upset about different things we're going to go through seasons and we're going to go thingss either because of our own choices because we chose to go the sinful route and now we have to suffer the consequences or because of the trials and tests that are coming at us we're going to go through times when we get tired and we get weary but the difference is God has promised to renew our strength if we will call on him if we will trust on him if we will wait on him he will renew our strength to keep fighting to keep pushing to make it through the times when everyone around us thought oh they're going down they're never getting up from that again this is it this is what finishes them cuz you've seen those kinds of things in those distance races where someone will fall and if you ever listen to any commentators about it they'll be like oh are they going to be able to get up are they done is this the end right and if we were talking about the Sprint yes it is the end they may get up and finish but there's they're nowhere close to any type of wind but when you're talking about the distance they get back up and they keep going and they keep running and when they hit the wall they keep running and they keep pushing themselves because the goal is the Finish Paul wrote We Run to finish you have the Finish Line ahead right as musicians come I already read this in Hebrews 12 but it says wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us one run with patience the race that is set before us in another translation it reads very similarly except it says and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us God has called us to keep running God has called us to keep running because the finish line is there and he's promised to renew our strength he's promised that he's going to help you overcome he's going to help you get through each one of those struggles each one of those trials we're not doing this because we're such amazing athletes we can do it on our own but we're doing it because we have a God that will renew us we have a God that will strengthen us we have a God that will pick us up when we fall down and will get us back on the path and it's not just running with patience but God calls us to run with endurance he calls us to keep enduring to keep pushing through each thing that comes along the endurance is what sets the distance Runners apart from the sprinters the sprinters are great at quick they're great at races that take seconds or minutes but they're not going to last for hours they're not going to last to keep going and keep going but the racers that are willing to live differently they're willing to eat differently they're willing to train differently they're willing to slim down and lay aside some of that weight and then with the endurance they'll keep running the race and they'll keep going they'll be able to go past the struggles they'll be able to to go past [Music] you know it's common in in distance racing particularly as people are beginning to learn it that it is super common for when people finish that they are vomiting as they get past the Finish Line because they have pushed their body to such a point that it doesn't know how to handle anything it doesn't know how to handle any water they've taken it it doesn't know how to handle it's just get rid of it all CU it doesn't know what to do because they have pushed themsel farther than most of us will even think about going and God is calling us to a race to go further and to run it differently than anyone we see around us God's calling us to be willing to live differently to be willing to train [Music] differently we're not having to go out and find who's the the latest great Theologian that can open up the scriptures to us and the greatest psychologist to help us with our families or help us with this struggle or that [Music] struggle God gave us his word and he gave us a prophet to open up the word to us and he says here this is your diet you don't need all the rest you need this and this is going to help you slim down it's going to help you to shed some of that extra weight that's been trying to hang on some of those habits that you used to have some of those things that used to try to to weigh you down and I'm going to be here and when you hit the wall when you hit that point where you go I don't have the strength to go any further I can't do anymore I've run [Music] out that's when God looks down and goes I can give you a refilling right I can renew your strength I can lift you back up I can give you what you need in this [Music] moment whether the second wind is something physical something mental in the natural it really doesn't matter God promised in his way of saying it I will renew your [Music] strength we can call it the second wind so that we have some type of fancy title to put on the sermon but really it comes down to God said wait on the Lord and I will renew your strength I will come in and I will help you get through it I will help you overcome I will help you break that barrier I will break those chains I will tear down the wall I will do the things that are needed so that you can keep running we're living a different kind of life because we're running a different kind of race we don't match up with the way the world does [Music] it and if you want to look at it from the physical stand Point those that are doing the sprinting look a lot more impressive if you're just going on looks they're the ones that they've got all the muscles they look like they should be the most powerful ones [Music] around and the ones going the distance are the scrawny skinny don't know if he could even you know carry his own luggage yeah but they're running different kinds of Races they have different types of goals and God has called us to run a different race with a different goal and he has promised that he would be the one to help us overcome and to strengthen us when we're hitting that wall [Music] Lord Jesus we lord I know this wasn't anything deep this wasn't anything amazing but Lord just to get us to maybe think about it a little bit different way tonight Lord Jesus to to look at life and through a little bit different lens Lord I pray that you would Lord if there was anything that I said that I shouldn't have said Lord I pray you would forgive me for Lord and Lord I pray that you would just allow the the words that were said Lord to to Quicken on the hearts of your people Lord Lord may it encourage them if they're going through a time when they're when they are struggling when they are dealing with different things Lord that you've promised that you would be the one to renew their strength you would be the one to give them that second wind to keep going Lord may it Inspire each one of us to to once again check up Lord and make sure are we equipping ourselves to run the race that you've actually called us to run that we're not training to try to to run the race the world does [Music] but that we're spending our time in the word that we're spending our time in prayer that we're spending our time with you to run the race that you've called us to run [Music] yes Lord we thank you for your presence Lord we thank you for the word that you've given us Lord that can speak to us so many different ways and that you can take these scriptures Lord that maybe to me are meaning one thing right now but to someone else because of what they're going through you're able to to speak to them in a different way Lord we thank you for your inspired word Lord we thank you for your Prophet that you sent Lord Lord we just thank you for for having called us for having chosen us Lord Jesus Lord I pray that you would be in the remainder as we take a little bit of time to just Worship You Lord and praise you some more and Lord may you just continue to minister to Hearts as you would see fit [Music] brother kobby what should we sing that wait upon the
