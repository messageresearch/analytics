[Music] [Music] you may be seated if you will about seven years ago on May the 7 1946 Greensville Indiana there was an angel coming to the room where I was at a man walking he didn't have wings he was just a big man had a white garment down to his feet and he said that I was born to pray for sick people and I told him I uneducated illiterate and I wasn't able to go he said I'd be praying for kings and monarchs and message around the world a message that would bring the second coming of Christ for and I told him I couldn't do it and he told me then for me to put my hands on the people they would be told what was wrong he said then if you'll be sincere it'll come to pass that you'll even know the secrets of your their heart and said by this they will believe and I said well that's what I was praying about I didn't understand it and he referred to the scriptures about Jesus knowing Phillip what he did before he come and got in the prayer line Jesus told him said you're a Christian or or a believer said how did you know I was a Believer a man whom there's no gu he said before Philip called you when he was under the tree I saw you he said you're the Son of [Music] God you believe he sent

burden Amen to share this message across the world Amen and to let the world know that God Amen of the Bible has returned in our generation to do something for us and isn't it a special thing this morning and we just bow our hearts together for a word of prayer before we open the word and maybe we just ask the Lord to come by today and amen just get into his word and minister to our needs how many say Lord speak to me amen Heavenly Father Lord as we've gathered here today on this beautiful Resurrection Sunday that you've given us Lord father we're coming into your presence this morning Lord not to exalt ourselves or to lift up ourselves but father we're coming boldly but humbly before your throne of mercy and Grace for Lord we are needy people but Lord your word told us that if we would come before your throne that we would find help in the time of need Lord I know this morning there's many needs in this assembly but Lord we're firm Believers today that your word is the answer oh God so father as the Believers have gathered here today in the songs of Zion have been sung Lord to create an atmosphere that you would be welcome in Lord that you could come and Lord you could minister to the needs of your children I pray this morning that you would send the spirit of wisdom and Revelation into the building oh God that Lord we would be sensitive to follow your leadership that Lord you could come and you could Minister specifically to the needs of your children Lord I pray for those that are sick and suffering in their body today Lord I pray God that you would break the hand of sickness over their body Lord Lord you would bring them relief oh God you would rebuke the suffering Lord I pray this morning for those that would be bound in spirit oh God lord may you

mercy and Grace in your word now father we ask you forgive us Lord we failed you Lord and strengthen us Lord that we can walk upright before you we love you this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the believer says amen and amen God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles we'll invite you in the scripture to the book of St John we want to turn to the book of St John the 20th chapter and and we want to look in the 18th verse of St John 20 we do want to greet you this morning on behalf of our pastor brother sea the Saints there at home send their greetings to you this morning and amen it's a it's a real special treat for me to get to be here with you all on a Sunday Sunday morning Amen to just Fellowship around the word with you and see all of our friends here God bless you this morning and amen the book of St John the 20th chapter in the 18th verse we want to look here in St John 20 in verse 18 the Bible says Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord that he had spoken these things unto her and then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews now I love this verse came Jesus and stood in the midst now we know that Jesus was the word made flesh so we could very well say this morning the word came and stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said and showed them them his hands in his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord and then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now I love the next verse because right after after he breathes on them and says receive the Holy Ghost he says whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained so after he breathed on them he literally breathed Authority into them that they could remit sins and retain sins because it would not be them it would be the god that had just come into them that had breathed upon them he breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning amen from those scriptures for just a few moments I want to by the help of the Lord to speak to you today and if I will title this I want to speak to you on freshly inspired by the Breath of God freshly inspired by the Breath of God you know amen I believe if there ever was a time amen that we could use a refreshing from the presence of the Lord amen I believe we could use it now amen I believe we could use a refreshing in our homes I believe we could use a refreshing in our Ministries a refreshing Amen in our young people a refreshing in our church I believe amen from the eldest to the youngest we could all amen use a refreshing from the presence of God and when you start thinking about that word refreshing of course you know uh that the root word there of refresh is to Fresh it means fresh and I looked at that definition it means having its original qualities unimpaired it's Fuller or renewed in Vigor now it's it's not stale it's not sour it's not decayed amen and it's not faded I love this one and it's not altered by processing so when something is fresh amen it's not stale it's not decayed it's not weak it's not sour amen but it has still got the same qualities that it had amen when it was first given now when you look at that word qualities it is the standard of something amen as measured against other things of a similar kind it is the degree of Excellence or something now I love this it is distinctive attribute or characteristic amen that is possessed by someone or something so when something is fresh the characteristic of it has not changed amen but it still has the same Vigor still has the same strength amen it's still in its original condition now I love what the prophet said in believe us th this now he says remember amen that Jesus had all the qualities of the father in him do you believe that amen sure he did all the fine gifts of God was in Christ his son amen for he was The Offspring of God another place he said and Jesus was possessed amen with all the fine qualities of God Amen but we but then he turns and says but when he met Satan in Matthew 4 he did not use any of those qualities he used the word all right when he met the devil he did not use any of the qualities that was given to him of the father amen he relied on the word and he said the these things it is written amen that man shall not live by bread alone so in other words he was by the word bringing into reach of the weakest of Christians amen the same word and the same quality of word amen that was in the beginning now amen to draw a thought this morning I want to read just a few paragraphs here from 1956 here ye him on Matthew Matthew 17 brother I'm speaking of Jesus on Mount Transfiguration he said now you know that God's word is so Eternal it is so inspired that it's not just for one occasion or for one generation but the word of God Is So Eternal it is the same it is the truth amen the word of God is the same the word of God is eternal amen and the word of God is the truth he said this same word amen that inspired the disciples it inspired the first or disciples and then the next as they followed down through the Lutheran age the Methodist age and every age amen is just as sufficient and inspiring today Amen to to us as it was the first day it was given amen and if the world should stand a million years amen that word would still be just as Inspire Amen to the generations that will follow us as it is to us amen because it is perfect he said one great way we could approach this afternoon as the coming of the Lord see amen first to Moses then Elijah and then Jesus amen but then we notice Peter while he was there amen he had just been freshly inspired amen because he gave a witness to who Jesus was amen and he was inspired now here amen you've got Jesus up on the mountain amen and there's Moses and there's Elijah from the Old Testament amen and here is Jesus amen the word made flesh so the same word amen that they were writing about is now standing in their midst Amen in flesh amen but here's also Peter amen who's from the New Testament amen but the same effect that the word had on MOS Moses and Elijah it was now having on Peter amen because the word does not change it is the same yesterday amen today and forever amen the prophet said now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word then the two Inspirations gives a result he said no matter how well you study the word it'll never do you no good till you are inspired yourself it takes your inspiration the word is already inspired how many can say thank God amen that I come to church and the word is already inspired now if you'll be honest there's many times you come amen that if you're honest with yourself you're not inspired you've had a bad day or you're going through a situation or something's happening amen but thank God that the word is always inspired amen he said so what we need today is an inspiration over us amen God sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love and himself that it might Inspire us to Quicken us and to awaken us to his word and when the word being brought in the spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles happen and things take place because the two amen just comes together amen so what is inspiring this word bride amen is not a feeling it's not a sensation amen but what is inspiring the bride amen is the same word that inspired the disciples that inspired Moses and inspired Elijah and inspired that word amen has come into the midst of the church in the last day amen to breathe over the church amen to awaken them from the things of Leota and to bring them into a clear understanding amen of their full position as a Believer listen we're not a bunch of defeated Believers here today amen if we're following this word amen then the same inspiration amen that was moving in the alpha has come into the Omega and we're moving and miracles are happening and things are happening amen because the word is always inspired amen I love to say it like this on my good days the word is inspired and on my bad days the word is inspired amen when I feel good in my body the word is inspired and when I'm sick in my body amen the word is inspired because this is not a word with a certain meaning amen for a temporary time amen but this is an eternal word and it still has its original qualities and they're unimpaired and they're not sour and they're not decayed amen but they're just as fresh today as they were when the word was spoken he said every generation can pick up the same word because it's inspired it's Eternal it's Everlasting it's a nonfading declaration from God no matter if the apostles read it in their age it meant something for them if Wesley read it in his age and Luther in his age and Calvin in his age amen but yet today it's just as brilliant and bright and got just as much of an effect as it did for them amen on the very day it was spoken in other words he said if you say John you come over to my house I'll be glad to see you amen that's a man's words and it just means John come over to our house but when God speaks amen there's a difference in when a man speaks and when God speaks he said when God speaks it's Eternal amen it's breathed from the very breath of the immortal everlas lasting Creator himself so there's no way to ever find the full meaning of any expression of God Amen it's for every age and every generation I don't believe we got to sit here amen and look back to 30 years ago or 20 years ago or 10 years ago and we might as well preach we here or even five years ago and say I remember in the old church and I remember when we first come I'm oh no I don't believe we got to look back Amen to see God Amen but I believe the God Amen that was moving 30 years ago amen it's the same God who is here manifesting himself amen as a God that does not fade as a God that does not fail listen Church there is a nonfading declaration that has been spoken over your life by this message and if you can renounce every dishonest thing and believe the report of the Lord it'll release an inspiration it'll bring a refreshing it'll bring a renewing amen you'll fall in love with Jesus all over again amen because it's not a stale word amen it's an inspired word amen the word of God is Not sour it's inspired amen now in job 32:8 amen I love this the Bible says amen that there is a spirit in man amen and the inspiration of the almighty amen giveth them understanding that word inspiration means breath it means Spirit Breath of God breath of man amen every breathing thing the spirit of man amen now we have the definition of the word inspiration amen as the Breath of God so in other words we could say Amen that the breath of the almighty God Amen is the inspiration of the almighty amen the Breath of God Amen is the inspiration of the almighty god brother said oh God who formed the heavens and the Earth amen and just let his breath go forth with his word and everything take in its right position now listen the Earth the moon the stars all swung into place amen just as God breathe on his word and oh God today we ask that you'll breathe on your word as we are trying to bring it to your people may it take its position this morning its place and be rooted and grounded in every heart that every person here amen might receive your full blessing now let me say this when you look at the Moon tonight amen remember that the Moon is there by the Breath of God when you look at the trees remember the trees are there amen by the Breath of God when you see the stars come out and take their position in the solar system amen don't think that there's something holding it there amen the what put it there is the Breath of God and what's holding is air is the Breath of God so here the prophet is saying amen that the moon the Earth the Stars amen they all took their place amen as God's word breathed upon them listen some of you all this morning amen you don't need a new church you don't need a new pastor you don't need a new job you don't need a raise on your job Amen to get back in your position you just need the Breath of God Amen to breathe across the church again amen and you'll swing out of depression and you'll swing into joy unspeakable you just need the Breath of God Amen to breathe upon your family to breathe upon your body listen I still believe that when God begins to breathe amen things begin to change I believe when God begins to breathe his word across his creation things begin to change if he could do it in the natural creation he can do it in the spiritual creation because he's God and His word never changes May the Breath of God move across the church and it take its position he said father I think how that you ever stoop down Amen to pick up a poor sinner lost like myself but by the grace of God now I am your child he said many others in here Lord amen they feel the same way we're here just breathing amen because you let us breathe your great spirit is moving through this building like the air that's circulating over here now can I say this every breath we draw it comes from the divine grace of God pro God said Every Breath You ever breathe amen it came from God now if you go to Genesis 2 you'll find that is the first time the word breath is mentioned in the Bible in Genesis 2:7 the Bible says the Lord God for man of the Dust of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life he amen and Man became a living Soul now the prophet picks this up and question answers on Genesis and said I can see Adam standing let's take this way seem standing like a tree amen God had made him now watch he was dead as he could be his toes like the roots sticking in the ground amen but God said let there be or he breathed the breath of life into him and he jumped and came to himself see he breathed the breath of life into him and he became a living soul he said now he begin to move on and on Amen so here is Adam amen Genesis 1 creation Genesis 2 creation and here is Adam amen standing in the ground his toes like the roots amen he's got life there as far as being created amen but there's no life in him amen but when God breathes upon him he comes to himself amen and recognizes who he is amen now it don't take long to remember in Luke 15 amen that there was a prodical son and the Bible say said he belonged in the father's house amen but he found himself among the swine amen but one day amen there was a breath come by his way and the Bible said he came to himself and realized I'm out of my position I don't belong in the sign I don't belong in the pig pin amen I got a father I've got a home listen friends and the Breath of God Amen brought the prodical son amen from the hall pin back to the father's house that was the same breath that brought Adam to recognition that he was in amateure God and he was created with a godship and a sunship and a Dominion as the Son of God well may I say that's the same breath amen that's breathing in this building this morning Amen to remind you you are a son of God you are an amateur God you've got the authority of God you got the power of God you got the word of God you don't have to stay out of position any longer there is a breath of wind coming from the word of God to swing you back into your position and anchor you there with the word of God rooted and grounded rooted and grounded into your heart now a minute I'm just going to lay a foundation if that's okay because the Breath of God brought Adam to himself you realize that the same breath amen is connected to Creation in Isaiah 42:5 the Bible says thus saith the good the thus saith God the Lord he that create the heavens and stretched them out he that spreaded forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it now I love this verse because the Bible said he created the heavens and he stretched them out amen and he spread forth over the Earth amen and then he created that which come out of it he giveth the breath unto the people upon it amen and the spirit to them that walk therein so in other words he creates the heavens he creates the Earth then he creates the things that come out of it amen but then he returns and the same breath created it he now breathes into it to supply them the ability and the spirit amen to walk upon what he has created amen this is a simple illustration am but it's like this amen you take a man named Walt Disney and he makes Disney World and he's got all these rides and all these attractions and all the and he goes down there and creates all this and then he calls you and says I've created it there it is but the problem is amen you look at the prices and we realize am me you created something a little expensive buddy you know amen so you're look at the prices you're say there no way I can afford to spend seven days here amen but then Walt Disney turns around and says well I created it and here's you the memes to go in and enjoy it in other words he did not just create it for you to stand on the outside and say it's a nice creation I wish I could enjoy it but he returns and gives you the token amen the ability to go in and enjoy listen friends God didn't send this message amen as a creation spoken word amen for you to sit on the outside and say I wish I could enjoy that I wish I could believe that amen but the same God that created the heavens and the Earth is the same God that responds you with the Holy Ghost listen you ain't got to stay out of the blessings of God you ain't got to stay out of the anointing you ain't got to stay out of the inspiration there has been a way provided for every believer to move into the provision of God by the Breath of God you don't have to stay on the outside God has made a way for you to come into these things and to enjoy them he said you are The God Who breathe the you breathe the forth the first breath of life that ever come on the earth and has control of every life until this present time and shall forever more control amen for thou art the creator of all mankind and all things that breathe brother another place he said upon the mountains at night time watching the great planations and so forth the great planets of the heavens and the solar system system knowing you made them and you spun them out with your hands now watch this you blowed your breath in the palm of your hand and every Star come into existence he was holding in his hand brother Wendell amen the stars but when that powerful Immortal breath be to Bow across his hand he said every Star come into existence now you all know Isaiah 14 amen says that the devil in the last days would exalt himself amen above the the Throne of God above the stars of God Amen and a Prophet come and said the stars of God are the sons of God so in the last days amen Lucifer would come into the church and he would try to disposition amen the stars of God from their position amen but at the same time amen that Satan would blow his poisonous breath would be when the wind of God would return to the church and while the devil was trying to disposition you amen the anointing would be position Ling you amen as an identified believer in the word of almighty God Amen I believe it today I believe amen that breath is a sign of Life y'all hear me breath is a sign of life amen if somebody Falls over amen you call 911 what's the first thing they say are they breathing because breath is a sign of life amen if there is no breath amen there is no life now I'm going to preach this morning if that's okay if there is no breath then there is no life and the prophet said now the baby is born with live muscles he's got a beating heart amen but no Breath of Life in it the muscles are twitching then see if there was something different from that if there wasn't a spirit that had to come in later then our breath could leave us and we would Breathe No More and still be alive but when this body doesn't receive oxygen or breath when this body how many believes this church is the body how many believes that you are a part how many believes that new life Outreach amen is a part of the of the universal body of Jesus Christ if this body does not receive oxygen or breath brother says intake and outake of our lungs amen then we are dead now I tell you how I read that amen is we got to take some things in and we got to put some things out amen as a body you're going to take some things in and some things you got to take in but some things you got to put out amen and if you if all you do is take in take in take in amen you are dead amen because the prophet set a sign of life is the ability to intake and outake I might as well preach amen cuz a lot of times amen the things that we're taking in amen are things we need to put out amen we take in problems and we hold on to our problems we take in situations and we hold on to the situation amen and before long the church gets so deprived of oxygen that you can't even praise well we might as well preach you can't even sing no more you can't even worship no more because all you're doing is intake and intake and y'all know why the dead Sea's dead amen because it's got an inlet but it don't have an outlet so everything comes in it doesn't mean it's good for it amen and every devil that comes along your way it does not mean you got to entertain that devil there is a breath of wind from the holy ghost that you have been given a powerful set of lungs Amen to breathe out the problems and to breathe in the promise you have been given a powerful come on church to breathe out depression and to breathe in joy you have been given a powerful set of lungs Amen to breathe out negativity and to breathe in positivity I say oh God let our lungs amen fill up with the Wind of the Holy Ghost again until we can breathe like a church ought to breathe we can sing like a church ought to sing We can preach like a church ought to preach we can pull like a church ought to pull amen God breathe in US Lord breathe into our lungs breathe into our church breathe into our young people let the Breath of God breathe in the church again and until we breathe out everything that's contrary to the message of the hour and let the wind of God hallelujah blow in the church again now amen you got to breathe some things out that's right you got to breathe some things out and you got to breathe some things in you know what builds powerful lungs is the ability to breathe in and the ability to breathe out now another thing that breath in the Bible is connected to is praise the Bible says let let me back up here for second the Bible says that that the spirit of the Living God of almighty God the inspiration is what giveth giveth us understanding y'all believe that the spirit of the inspiration of the almighty God is what gives us understanding thinking men's filter said Grant Lord that we may know how that we should give you praise it's beyond our understanding to know how to give you praise it's beyond our understanding to know how to give you praise so it's beyond our ability amen it's beyond I said it this way amen we do not possess the human ability to know how to praise a God Like Our God listen we don't know how to praise a God that created the heavens and the Earth we don't know how to praise a God that spoke to nothing and created everything we don't know how to praise a God Amen that can raise the dead can heal the blind can restore the Lost we don't know how to praise a god like that but in the end time a prophet would come and say here it is let everything that has breath amen praise ye the Lord we don't know how to praise Him amen for the moon we don't know how to praise him for the Stars we don't know how to praise him for the healing amen but he said don't worry about that amen you don't know how to do it but I'll Supply you the breath to do it and the breath that I give you will be the understanding of how to praise me so we don't have to know how to hold our hands we don't know how to put our feet we don't have to know how to say the right words they only thing thing we got to know how to do amen is let the Creator who breathed into the creation amen take control of our lungs and we'll begin to praise him well can I ask you something amen what's happened to our praise amen where's our praise gone amen if we had so many problems and so many situations amen that we forgot how to praise I tell you what we need this morning we need to get our praise back church I said we need to get our praise back we need to get back to where we praise God until things change y'all remember how we used to do we used to praise God till the mountain moved we used to praise God till the Red Sea opened we used to praise God Amen until the walls Begin to Fall amen but somewhere somewhere amen we took in some problems and took in some situation and the devil has choked amen the praise of God right out of our church come on elders amen if the devil chokes it out of you he'll choke it out of these young people if he chokes out of these young people you'll have a dead church with a bunch of people sitting around amen arguing about everything except what ought to be happening but if God begins to breathe and he breathes in the elders there'll be a praise in the elders and there'll be a praise in the young people there'll be a praise in the pit there'll be a praise in the musicians there'll be a praise in the singers there'll be a praise in the young people I say oh God Amen breathe on the church again until we get our praise back we can say amen hallelujah come on I know what I'm talking about amen the devil wants to choke her praise but I think it's time to choke that Devil with her praise I said I think it's time Amen to choke that Devil with her praise I think it's time to praise God devil says you ain't got nothing to praise him for I'm alive and well I got something to praise him for you ain't got nothing to praise him for he saved my soul brother William he gave me the Holy Ghost he give me the work on come on choke that Devil with your praise he's BR your praise long enough Amen Let the praise of the almighty God return in the courts amen and praise the Lord until your praise amen chokes every formal devil it chokes every traditional come on new life amen it's time to choke the devil again amen with the Praises that belong unto our God he is worthy brother Merl he is worthy of Our Praise he is worthy of our worship listen I know things might be not looking good amen but if you start praying in the God he can change the way it looks I know it may look like it's going down but if you can start praising the God he's the god that walked on water amen he's the god that raised the Dead He's The God That healed the leper amen and that God is in our midst this morning Hallelujah let everything that ha breath praise ye the Lord let everything that hath breath amen praise ye the Lord Brother said it very beautifully he said the other day we us out in Tucson he said we needed to hear some fresh word he said we didn't have nowhere to go so some of us Brothers went down to Baptist Church you know he said we went in there that's because he didn't have nowhere to go well that's another sermon for another time God told me not long ago he said well brother Andrew he said I just go to baptist church now he said I I brother BR did I said well yeah I said but where do you live he said well I live here he said well there ain't no church close enough to me I said there ain't well what's your address I looked up on my phone I counted three churches within 20 minutes of his house yeah come on come on he said well brother Andrew there ain't no church I can go to I said no problem is ain't no church you can go to you agree with come on church amen but we're not here to agree with each other if we can all agree with the word then the Oneness with the word will bring a unity in the church come on church if we can all agree that the message is right and the word is absolute and the word has let amen then you might not agree with me and I might not agree with you but if we agree with the same word then somewhere there's going to come a liberty of unity in the body and we'll realize we're not here just to agree with each other we are agreeing with the word I know what I'm talking about it's here so I might as well preach amen how long are we going to choke the atmosphere over things we don't agree with how long are we going to choke the anointing out of the meetings because somebody sng a song that we don't like somebody read a scripture that we didn't think all to be ready to this s come on chur I think it's time to release the atmosphere I think listen our young people need the Holy Ghost our churches need to move amen release the atmosphere take your hands off of it and let the anointing flow again until our young people can know what it's like to get carried away in the anointing come on Church take your hands off the atmosphere and let God breathed in the church again we've choked him out long enough well I don't think they ought to stand I don't think we ought to shout I don't think we ought to say that well we might not like sitting so let the sitter sit and the standers stand and the singers sing and the preachers preach and the criers cry and the runners run and the shouters shout and the teachers teach let's just get back to Heaven church again where the wind of God could blow in the church with power and authority and Liberty blow the cobwebs out of the atmosphere and let the anointing come back in the church well I don't like this I amen there's a lot of things we don't like but we're not babies No More Hell come on that's a truth well brother and I don't like this song well listen amen we don't have to sing all old songs on and we don't have to sing all new songs can I preach brother Wendell amen anything the devil can use to choke the atmosphere he will are you hearing me I've literally seen people brother way get this idea now if God's going to be in the song service we got to sing songs that Luther didn't even know cuz those are real old songs and those are the real anointed songs and listen I've sat in those Mee brother William and we sang those songs and there wasn't an ounce more of anointing come in the building amen than when we sang a new song you know why because it's not the song it's your attitude towards the song is what changes the atmosphere in the meeting come on church amen listen I don't care if he comes on how great thou art or There Is Power in the Blood or I would not be denied or our god is awesome or he's a way maker I don't care how he comes charh I just want him to come into the building and manifest himself listen amen if he comes on how great thou are I say bless his name and if he comes on our god is awesome I say bless his name because I know before long if he comes in the building he's going to blow the devil out and there's going to come an anointing there going to come a liberty there going to come a healing I said God open up the atmosphere appear again until the wind of God can blow in his creation and God can rejoice in his people well I don't think they ought to preach those things well it's a message church so what do you want us to preach come on you want a Baptist idea this ain't a Baptist Church this is a message church so in a message church we preach the message come on the message is still inspired yes sir come on now you know why oh mercy now let me say this the devil get among people and they say well then I tell you why people shouting like that that kind of teaching amen there false spirits in the last days will invade pull pits no don't get mad at us because you had a stale version of the message give to you come on we're not feeding on a stale version our message has not been altered by some personality that's processed what a prophet said we are standing on Vindicated word and there's a liberty in this word we can teach the seventh seal we can teach the son of man we can preach the third pull because we're in the channel of inspiration where God can blow in the church well yall know it's the truth brother said now the breath is the wind and the wind is what you breae in your nostrils now y'all familiar with the tape Blasphemous names aren't you comes in the air and he says these words he said now I'm going to correct the Jehovah Witness teaching because they teach that the breath you breathe is the soul he said that's not right he said now watch the breath is wind and the wind is what you breathe in the nostrils then he goes to Genesis 2 and said but what God did is he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he became a living Soul a soul that cannot die oh my now notice he breathed the breath I love this brother William of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul CA God breathed not what nature do done but what God did breathe the breath of life into his nostrils he become a living Soul then you say to me Adam died brother brandom but remember before Adam died he had a lamb amen that redeemed him Hallelujah those he fornew he has called he got a lamb to redeem them he was a type and Adam fell then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of the Eternal God and he became a living Soul he was a son of God notice this the prophet of God said we're not breathing amoya he said amoya is the wind or the Unseen Force he said animals breathe amoya Sinners breathe aoya he said but God especially upon Adam he breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power like God he was an amateur God he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven god of the earth now watch this God in Adam made him the god of the earth brother B stops and says now and someday the sons of God will again become Gods someday the sons of God will again become Gods how will they do that amen it is written in your law you are God if you call those who called God God visited how can you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God can I say this the same breath that breathed into Adam and made him a living soul and breathe and the breath become eternal life and made him a god of the earth is the same breath amen that's breed in the true church and the prophet says the church is the mystical Body of Christ amen born of the Breath of God the Church of God is born of the Breath of God because God breathed into the nostrils spiritually of Adam and he become a living Soul let me read you and see whether the church is born of the Breath of God or not like Adam was in the beginning and he reads John 20 and he says now watch the father has sent him went in him and Jesus when he sends a disciple he goes in him then he reads read to uh 20 John 20 again and says Church born of the Breath of God when this stature has molded itself up there somebody say molded molded itself up there when the stature has molded itself up there in condition amen God breathes a breath upon them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God and you can enjoy you can join anything you want to but you're born into the church of living God Amen you are born by the Breath of God now watch a prophet God breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost God breathed upon them brother Duran and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now watch this there you are not com and join amen but when you become a child of God you are born by the Breath of God can I say this you do not join the church you do not join the word amen you are born by the word and the prophet said this is the word of the Lord then it's his premeditated thoughts that's how we have eternal life because we were spoken into existence by God not joined into a church but born by the word the original seed that God said let there be and there was listen you have come into existence amen by The Original Seed of the original word that was spoken by the only true Living God and you have come into existence amen by the Breath of God now let me say this what whatever brought you into existence is the only thing that can take you out are you hearing me whatever brought you into existence is the only thing that can take you out that's why the prophet of God said the devil can do what he wants to amen but he cannot take my life until God is finished with me on the earth he said well brother Andrew the devil took him no the devil didn't take him amen God released him amen from this Tabernacle of humiliation this pest house Amen to go to his father's house let me say this there's a reason why the devil hates his church there's a reason why the devil hates his Pastor there's a reason why the devil hates his bride it's cuz he's done everything that he can Amen to take New Life Outreach out of existence amen but every trial and every situation and every problem amen she don't get weaker she just gets stronger she don't get loud oh come on she don't get lazy she just gets more fervent you know why because you've been born by the Breath of God now let me say this if you're born by the word god watches over his word and God Reveals His word and his word must have the preeminence now watch a prophet then seeing a little minority group amen gathered out there under the inspiration of God producing again the life of Jesus Christ by the scriptures that's supposed to happen you know what hour you're living in he said what is it it's the word somebody say the word word join joining with the word it's the word joining with the word brother Kobe all that the father hath given me they will come to me amen the word joining with the word in other words amen you are not called by feeling you are not called by song you are not called by special preacher you are called by the word in other words the written word amen called out to the predestinated word that was in your soul the word is a written word but you are the predestinated word and when this word begins to call the only thing it can call is the word so you were not joined to a feeling you were not joined to an emotion you were not joined to a gift you were joined to the word then that's why that the word is your Victory that's why the word is your answer that's why the word is your power amen oh come on church are can I ask now now now let me just say this let me let me let me just slow down here and drop this in it's a very direct question okay is that okay brother wendle are we sufficiently impressed with the word are we sufficiently impressed with the word brother said Jesus knew there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the perg church age which was yet 200 years off from the Patmos Vision he knew the drift would cause him to go in Dark Ages he knew that was the way man AR is got from God was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left god plain and simple if you leave the word you have left God thus he has presented himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages now here's what he's saying I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word listen don't ever let anyone or anything get between you in that word this which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself amen I am the word remember that then the prophet asked the question I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst now notice he did not say are we sufficiently impressed with signs come on he said word although we believe in Signs Now you said brother why would he say word and not signs because signs can be impersonated but the word which is the opening of the word the third pull cannot be impersonated in 2 Thessalonians 2:8 Paul said then that shall the wicked be revealed now watch this whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him who's coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and line wonders now watch this the now now if you speak a word with your mouth amen what comes out of your mouth breath so here he's saying that the the wicked one is going to be revealed but the Lord will consume with the spirit of his mouth in other words the same breath that borne you destroys your enemy the same breath that breathed over the church and brought the revealing of the son of man into manifestation is the same breath that will consume the SP of predition the wicked one and will destroy him with the brightness of his coming brother when that word is refused amen then they are turned to their desires now let me say this the word is the truth the word is the truth and we are lovers of the word which makes us lovers of Truth now you say brother are you against signs I'm not against signs can we clear that that up I believe in signs the Bible speaks of signs in Exodus 7 the signs of Wonders were done the land of Egypt in Mark 16 Jesus said amen that sign shall follow them to believe in John 4 Jesus said you won't believe except you see signs and wonders now watch this the Bible instructs us Amen to try the spirits in other words we must give them the word test because there's a generation of sign Seekers that knows nothing more about the true move of God in his word in these last days brother said how can you tell them give them the word test how can you know it speak the word and see what they say about it if they don't believe the word they do not have the seed germ in them they are of the evil one and deceive you now can I can I say what the prophet said is that okay God never placed signs ahead of his word that's a scorcher he said God never Place signs ahead of his word they were added for the proof of the word but the word is first to prove it Elijah said to the woman bake me a cake first then watch the miracle happen remember said come to the word first then watch the miracle the seed word itself is what the Holy Spirit energizes can I say this to you the miracle takes place on the word brother said it very beautiful he said because the word is the seed that brings forth a miracle so how many believers do I have here today as a Believer you are Iden ified in Mark 16 as a part of the true church you are identified in Mark 16 and Mark 16 said amen that signs and wonders amen shall follow them that believe in other words amen they're not following signs and wonders come on Church the Believers are not following signs and wonders but signs and wonders are following the Believers we are not following signs and wonders but signs and wonders are following us I never will forget as a young kid at Louisiana Camp some of y'all probably remember brother Danny steeman preaching one time on Mark 16 and he got two little boys he said now your signs and your wonders and he called them signs and wonders and he said now watch he said everywhere I go I want you to follow me cuz I'm a Believer and brother Danny just took off walking and brother Josh he never stopped and turned around and said are you there signs and wonders he never stopped and had a prayer meeting and S her signs and wonders there he said wherever I go as the believer signs and wonders follow me he said if I speed up then signs and wonders speed up if I slow down signs and wonders slow down I love this one he walked off the platform in the back room and he said if I walk into Dark Places amen signs and wonders follow me in the dark places because I am a believer oh Church of the Living God unclog the channel of inspiration in your soul and let a word move back in there and let a the word take preeminence then you'll see signs then you'll see wonders when the word has preeminence in your midst and you are sufficiently impressed with that [Music] word now the prod of God said it very beautiful he said look at job he said when he couldn't now oh my I'm running out of time he said when he couldn't get a when he couldn't get a word from God he said the devil could not move him can I say this there's going to be times that you can't get a word we're human okay there's going to be times you can't pray hard enough to get it open going to be times you can't scream loud enough to get it open but you got to stand there as a word believer knowing who you are when you know you've done exactly what God told you to do see then wait for the channel of inspiration to open up to you now listen friends the reason we must have the word in our midst and let that word have preeminence is because of this the devil can impersonate signs to mislead the church away from the word but when you're Simeon and it's been revealed to you and you know beyond the shadow of a doubt I'm not going to die until I seen the Lord's Christ then there will be something in your soul that will bear record with the inspiration that revealed the promise to you that you will not accept anything except the clearly identified manifestation of the promised God gave you now can I say it like this how many days did Simeon as an old man wake up with pain in his back with stop shoulders with all kinds of problems and say Lord I wish today was the day I wish today was the day I would see that Christ child and I just go on home right amen and maybe he could go down the CH to the church and in walk a little girl amen if he was following signs and wonders the devil could have got in there and that little girl and said present that baby to Simeon and he'll accept it but because Simeon was a believer of the spiritual Revelation that was given to him by almighty God you could not trick Simeon into believe in anything that was contrary Amen to the revelation God had given him concerning his promise and bride of Jesus Christ we have come back to the headship of the word of almighty God then we will not accept any feeling we will not accept any gift we will not accept any impersonation that is contrary to the word of God to lead us away from the Vindicated revelation of the promise of the Rapture that is upon the church listen I believe we'll end to let ourselves move out of the way and let the word move in the Pro of God said the greatest enemy I gotten is William Brandon he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to the place he's out of the way then God can come in and do things William brandom knows nothing about that's when God can use you can I say this when we're out of the way the inspired word moves in and does things he said preach a gospel that can make people actually that was once bootleggers and gamblers and prostitutes everything else out on the street sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and can feel the inspiration of the spirit to rise you to a place till you lose yourself and scream out amen hallelujah praises to God that's a wonderful thing now why is that happening because the identified word is back in our midst and we're impressed by it and we're freshly inspired by it now can I say this to you can you give me second Timothy 3 verse 13 notice this in second Timothy 3:13 now evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse right deceiving and being deceived brother said before the weeks over this next week I'm going to preach much on these things of the dullness how that the world has blowed its poisonous breath into the face of the people that's got them deceived the world has blowed its poisonous breath in the face of the people and has got them deceived they think they're Christians many of them they're not Jesus spoke at this appointment here look at verse 14 but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of no one of whom thou has learned them and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise un salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus now look at verse 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction in righteousness somebody say this with me all scripture all scripture now you're looking at that little threel word all and you're saying that couldn't have much of a meaning but brother Kobe I looked up the definition of all and it means each every any all the whole everyone all things everything so brother Duren I can say any Scripture is given by inspiration of God all scripture the whole scripture everything in the scripture all things contained in the scripture is given by the inspiration of god brother aren't you glad to know that Jesus said all scripture is inspired and not one bit of it can keep from being fulfilled when God speaks inspired word there's not one confusion there's not one bad Spirit there's not one negative idea that can defeat the Fulfillment of the inspired word of God y'all remember brother talked about the woman laying on her deathbed he said she was laying there dying and he said her son got a telegram your mama's dying hurry up and get home so brother Donald she she she laying there dying her son can't get home in time amen but a few weeks later he comes home and she's sitting in her chair and she's doing well and he walks in there and he says mama what's going on you were dying she said I was honey she said but the church come down here the Full Gospel Church in other words all scripture the Full Gospel Church that believed all the scripture any of the scripture everything in the scripture was inspired come down here and read Mark 16 over me and they prayed for me and God healed me he said M what are you talking about she said Woo glory to God Amen brother said he looked at her and said Mommy you're even acting like him she said well honey what are you talking about he said in the Seminary they Tau us that Mark 16 from the 9th verse on is uninspired now watch a prophet brother said that woman looked at him and said I was thinking if God could heal me with the uninspired word if God could heal me and raise me from the dead by the uninspired word then what could he really do with that that is really inspired and brother says very beautiful we have to believe all God's word is inspired it has all its right meanings and all the false conceptions of the earth which looks real and looks reasonable is only a perverted Act of the devil from the original plan of God that's why in the last days that God sent a prophet among the church to say these words that Mark 16 is just as inspired as John 3:16 John 3:16 John 3:16 but here's a prophet saying We Believe John 316 but let's go to Mark 16 let's go to John 14 let's go to John 1613 let's go beyond the uninspired understanding of a bunch of theologians that's trying to choke the church on traditions and Creeds and ritualistic ideas let's go into the inspired word where there's a healing where there's a liberty now brother Wendell he said Mark 16:9 from the ninth verse on is uninspired now you all know me I'm the guy that says why did they pick the ninth verse so brother Austin and I went and read the ninth verse and here's what it said when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene of whom he had cast Seven Devils then I found where the prophet of God said the son told the mama Mar Mark 16 from the ninth verse on is uninspired and it was put there by a false witness okay but in Mark 16:9 the Bible said Jesus was risen early on the first day of the week who he appeared to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils so when he appeared on the resurrection morning he did not go to somebody that was there when the Devils was cast out of Mary he went to her herself come on church then Mark 169 is not a false witness it's a true witness of a woman who experienced amen the power of the one that was in the grave has just AIS out of the grave and she can stand there and say I know you because you were the one that cast Seven Devils out of me Church of the Living God I say there's an authority there's an inspiration the church that's why we're shouting that's why we're hollering is because when the God we read about walks in the building there is something in our soul that can bear record with him and say that's the god that saved me that's the god that healed me that's the god that delivered me that's the god that redeemed my baby babies that's the god that give me the Holy Ghost that's the god that saved my marriage that's the god that saved my testimony that's the god that saved me when everything was looking lost that's the god that came on the scene hall hallelujah we are freshly inspired by the Breath of [Applause] God now the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and the prophet said the prophet is a reflector of God's word now he cannot say his own thoughts brother Darren he can only speak what God reveals now in the last days there's a danger I'm I'm tying this up in the last days there's a danger you ready for this danger brother B called it uninspired leadership direct quote now look in Jeremiah can you give me Jeremiah 18:18 look at this verse then said they come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the Prophet come and let us Smite with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words and other words that's just his opinion in other words that's just who he was talking to at a specific time it don't apply to this Bride come on are you hearing me in other words men were anointed to raise up and say ignore what Jeremiah said and the problem God said it's been always these time of group of leaders that gets the people all mixed up it's not so much the people it's the leaders that get them mixed up oh you say brother Brandon well now just a minute look here by their worldly words of wisdom in their by their words of wisdom in their uninspired leadership words of worldly wisdom so when they stand up and they begin to speak things contrary to what a prophet taught listen the Breath of God Amen is in a prophet and Men of God who are preaching what a prophet said are breathing over the church with the fresh breath of the immortal God the Creator but when men get in the pulpit and they start saying things and teaching things and pointing things in a different direction from what a prophet said watch what happened in Matthew 14 when the multitude sent away he went up on the mountain the park to pray and when the evening was come they was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea and it was tossed with the waves amen for the wind was contrary so that same wind amen was the Breath of God that breathed in the beginning but now the devil has got in the wind and made the wind contrary and watch what a prophet said it's because Satan begin to push out his poison breath and has be to blow his WIS of strife amen breaking churches apart separating Brotherhood and making people think they're a little better than somebody else they belong in a better bracket they belong to a better Church listen there's only one church and that's the Church of Jesus Christ let me just go ahead and preach since I'm here because those breasts does not just blow universally they blow locally in a body and somebody gets in their mind that their kids are better than these kids and their kids shouldn't be a part of these kids and this family shouldn't fellowship with that family and before long the devil blows all across the church well come on church and the anointing ain't moving the same and the Liberty ain't fair and the Holy Ghost ain't moving and it's all because Satan got in the wind and begin to blow his poisonous breath and we got a little better idea of our kids or our family let me say this we are what we are by the grace of God and we need each other's Fellowship more now than we ever have before I think we ought to lay aside our worldly friendships and get some Godly friendships and get some Godly Fellowship come on I don't think our kids ought to have best friends on the sports team with a bunch of unbeliev and Leon Sans I think our kids best friends on be church kids that are following the same message under the same pillar of I don't think our kids ought to be somewhere else when something's going on with our young people in the house of God I think we ought to bind together as the body come on I might as well preach I'm here we ought to bind together as the body of Jesus Christ and let the liberty of God come back in the church again listen we are a family and Satan is doing everything he can to tear us apart and break us down and bind our hands I say oh God bow on this church until the wind of God breaks every stronghold destroys every shackle brings back love brings back Unity brings back Fellowship brother and you're getting way out there I'm not getting out there brother said when Satan seen the little Church Without Christ this is what he said this is my opportunity this is my time I'll teach them how to blaspheme see his poisonous breath is killing the word so your pastor stands up here and labors and labors and labors and labors and you go home and Satan comes to the house that's legalism that's old school don't nobody believe that no more that's unimportant we're Beyond Holiness we're beyond that kind of teaching well we might as well preach are we really or is the devil coming in and blowing his poisonous breath because somewhere we've changed filters on somewhere we changed filters y'all ever heard of this what happens in the natural happens in the spiritual y'all ever heard that y'all ever heard of this word the Clean Air Act you ever heard that Clean Air Act in the United States primary Federal air quality law it was intended to reduce and control air population Nationwide it was an act to improve to strengthen and accelerate programs for the prevention and the elimination of air pollution now brother brother Kobe I was reading this other day or thinking about this Clean Air Act and I got on my phone driving down the road and I like to wreck my truck I got on my phone and I looked up the Clean Air Act you know when this was initially inacted was 1963 wow in 1963 they are initially enacting something called the Clean Air Act in other words the trying to improve the air quality in the nation it's at the same time that a prophet is opening the Seven Seals and he's saying this is the word and he's exposing the Antichrist he's exposing the Pale Horse the White Horse the red horse the black he's doing all these things and what he's trying to do is improve the air quality that's in the church because it's so polluted with this idea about the Rapture and this idea about water baptism and this idea about predestination so a prophet comes and says we now have a filter and it's the word of God and if you'll put it in your home if you'll put it in your church if you'll put it in your bapti distry if you'll put it in your Sunday school if you'll put it in your young people it'll improve the air they're breathing listen it'll eliminate pollution and they'll be able to breathe the same Clear fresh Immortal air that they breathe in the beginning but you know what you going have to do you got to get rid of your man-made filters and put a thinking man's filter in now watch this and the prophet said what am I saying I'm saying the word is in the bride completion of what he had in his mind now what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying change your filters that's right hello true change your filter if you got a man-made filter and everything that's preached from the message goes to that filter it ain't going to get to you but if you'll change and left the Clean Air Act that's rightl come into your life now I might as well say it I honestly I think it's time to improve the air quality in our homes I do because nine times out of 10 when you got brother W I hope I ain't making too big of a mess nine times out of 10 when you got poor air quality in the home you going to have poor air quality in the church that's right because no matter how hard the word is preached and how clear and how great and how powerful if there's no clean air in the home and it's a bunch of fussing and fight and so and so did this and so and so did that and this one thought this and they looked at me and they thought that and they said this and they text this and they sent this they sent that and they said this and they didn't look at me and they didn't invite me come on church and that's what you feed on and then the well the preachers said this and brother wendle said that and brother W said this and brother so and so said that and brother so and so preach that and I don't think that applies what do you think about that's the air quality of your home that's but when you change your filter you can have clean air in the home you can have clean air in the car you can have clean air in the church what are you saying I'm saying put the tapes back on in your home come on Church put the tapes back on in your car come on well I ain't got time you you know what makes me people say they ain't got Tim less and tapes but they're caught up on every podcast they got every podcast covered they got every they got every they got every mother's society and every father's hunting societ they got all that taken care of and the quality of air in their home is killing the life of God it's choking the Revival out I say oh God let us get a backbone and change the filters until the revival can burn in our home it can burn on our job it can burn in our car it can burn bur in our school it can burn in our church God let the heir of God come back in the church until it can [Applause] burn what are you saying Bel Andrew I'm saying it's time to burn again I'm saying it's time to burn again Lord you say brother Andre burn again brother BR said yes he said it's time to clear the carbon off the lamp and let the fire of God burn again brother Andrew what are you getting at if you can take the word as your filter brother B said now the breath and the spirit has become the same and she's uniting together ready for this bringing forth that same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like he did back there he is she's manifesting the same Works he did back there is being manifested right here today the same thing in other words she has become he she's bone of his bone she's life of his life she's power of his power she is him watch a prophet in the Valley of the dry bones I'm closing on this somebody say bone of his bone bone of his bone life of his life of his life power of his power power of his power she is him she is him Ezekiel brother wend goes down and he looks at a big valley of dry bones been laying there for years there's no flesh there's no senu there's no muscle there's nothing but bones now if you all leave some bones out if you if you throw old deer carcass out and a little while Busters are going to fly in and they going to start picking apart everything and you know what brother ml one buster he going to get him a couple bones and he going to fly them over there another Buzzard going to get him some bones he going to fly them over there and before long you go okay we'll just say this way you got Jim and John in the valley of dry bones Jim's got a leg bone Jim's got a backbone Jim's got a neckbone right John's got a leg bone John's got a backbone John's got a John's got a neckbone are you hear me but let a buzzard get in there and he might take Jim's neckbone over there and take John's leg bone over there and take John's neckbone over there and for long it's a valley and they're all spread out all over the place but when Ezekiel looked at this valley of dry bones he asked this question can this church I mean can these bones live again can they live again can this bride live again can this can this can this bride live again Lord I'm looking at her she's scattered all across here can she live again a prophet looking at can the bride live again now watch so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together now watch this not bone to bone but bone to his bone so Jim didn't get John's neck bone and John get Jim's leg bone but when the Breath of God hallelujah when the Breath of God breathed across that Valley it had the power to restore to the original condition with the original qualities and John got his leg bone and John got his backbone and John got his neck bone and Jim got his leg bone and Jim got his neckbone and Jim got his back are you hearing me listen bone to his bone and the brother God said then what is that fourth stage he said it is the wind of God it is the message of Life what's it doing the pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again let me say this new life when God begins to breathe across your Valley amen you're not going to get so and so's testimony and so and so's joy and so and so's Victory amen but everything you lost when the wind of God begins to breathe across the valley you're going to get your joy back you're going to get your praise back you're going to get your worship back you're going to get your faith back you're going to get your word back you're going to get your anointing back you're going to get your Liberty back listen church I think it's time to let the Breath of God breathe across the church again until we get our praise back until we get our testimony back until we get our boldness back until we get our Liberty back God has provided a way listen people can I leave you at this we're not going to die spiritual death in Leota don't you bow your knee and accept this is the way it's going to be well this is the way things are going to be I'm just going to live a mediocre halfway lukewarm in one day out one day up one day down the next day life I heard a nonfading declaration from God over you you know what that Declaration was you can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with you that's inspired church that's concerning your life now Jonah in the belly of the whale first brother set up on the word of God he said now watch as the musicians are coming he said in the whale's belly he said' look what happened he said first he turned himself over in the bottom of the whale and seaweeds was wrapped around his neck where the whale had been eating these weeds and things to put vitamins in his body his vitamin pills and then he got a preacher in there said the well been eating vitamins and all kinds of things in his body brother wendley said but then he got a preacher in there are y'all ready for these words he
