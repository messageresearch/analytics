his neighbor next unto his house take it according to to the number of Souls and every man according to his eating shall make your account for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year and ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take the blood and strike it on the two sides of the post and the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in that night and roast it with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs shall they eat of it eat not of it raw nor soen at all with water but roast it with fire his head with his thigh and with the pertinent thereof and you shall let nothing of it remain until morning and that which remaineth of it until morning ye shall burn with fire and thus you shall eat it with your loins girded with your shoes on your feet with your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover and I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite the firstborn in the the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you amen and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of EG Egypt let's go to the Lord in prayer father we're so thankful for these scripture reading Lord and so

in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning amen praise the lord well isn't God just so wonderful amen amen he's so precious to us all isn't he amen I want to speak this morning on a on a just a simple title amen well it's a big title the token life of the son of man and what a incredible day that we live in we're living in a an incredible day we with modern society has has led all of us the world to Easy Living amen we we've got everything to uh uh just right at our fingertips and and uh you at one time could it it it it seemed like you could walk to Walmart or or go to Walmart or anywhere and you could pretty well find anything on the shelves and but we have seen a lot of things beginning to change these days as we have seen the the the war that is taking place the man uh we've got we've got Wars potential Wars that could just break out everywhere we've got amen that's we're living in a in an incredible hour and I think these things we can take advantage of them as we as as we see because you know brother brandham in countdown he says we notice the modern happen that we have we look at the scientific age that we live in the push button age and yet people have less time to pray than they ever did have and then in all these modern times they used to sit all night and listen to a mo to a sermon and now we can't do it we haven't got time to do it you see it's just in your head we think we haven't got time to do it but we have but we're living in that kind of a in that kind of an hour of Luke one warness and where the word of God but I uh where the word of God is not as as as rich as maybe it should be expectation isn't as rich as what it should be Amen in the lives of of of of God's people but yet as we begin to look and we see prophecies and the potential of prophecies and we as we're as we're beginning to see things getting a little uneasy man money's not as easy anymore and and and things are uh making you beginning to think a little bit more about the times about your life about your about where we are and I I think that maybe the Lord allows these kinds of times for the elect because I do believe that the coming of the Lord is right at hand I I I believe that lukewarmness should never dampen the expectation of of the believer and and because the tyranny of Satan has ruled and oppressed amen by his Wicked Fist and amen now he did have us laboring in sin and he had us laboring in we were Bound By by Demons of of sin before we come to Christ but we we find that many of times that we amen uh the we we are still laboring in his sweat shops uh amen uh he suppresses our joy he suppresses her praise suppresses our expectation keeping the soul the soul Bound by materialistic things and yet we are the very offspring of God and I want to amen let you know here this morning that we are not here on Earth to live to provide for our families we're not here on Earth to live in Comfort or to uh Drive nice cars or to live in nice houses we're not here on this Earth for materialistic things we we are here to be a body we're here to be an expression of Eternity we're we're here as the very Church of the Living God you see amen You're The Offspring of your creator you always were Sons you are the Eternal Gene seed of God but yet you were born in slavy to sin and death amen you were born with a sin nature you were born with uh uh in in corruption amen and Le out a sea Satan as Soul as so put it that amen he he he he wants the church to feel that they're totally free he wants Le Osa to rejoice and have churches and and wants Le osia to amen uh to have the mega churches wants wants families to raise their children in church he amen I'm talking about the oppressor I'm talking about Satan I'm talking about living under the tyranny of Satan amen once them amen you see he he takes the shackles that was once ound to the little to the little ball and chain and now he has extended the chain and so amen he he now allows you to get up and walk around in the room but you're still connected to a chain and so maybe we've been free from the cigarettes or maybe we've been free from the alcohol or maybe we've been free from a addictions of Amen of sin but you see Satan doesn't he he he owns the system Satan owns the church system amen and he and he and he wants us to to feel free he wants us to feel good that we we can walk around and go to church and that we can but yet we're still bound amen by by by the by by the chains of unbelief and still Bound by the chains of fear still Bound by amen H religious dogmas can you say Amen I I I say today that God is calling us to be free and and it's and and The Exodus time is upon us and it's going to take amen the blood the blood of Jesus Christ amen still can set the captives free amen we're not fighting against flesh and blood but we're fighting against spiritual wickedness amen and and and so we we we many of times we we uh the church seem seems to be happy when I say we I'm talking about the church system amen where uh the the the the the church world is just happy to to to have their name on a book or Amen to belong to a certain organization or belong and to have a Bible or a knowledge of God but God's not wanting people with a knowledge of him God is this is Exodus time folks amen this message uh uh church here this morning is not one that that that is that that that we are offering a a a a a a new idea we're not here preaching a just a a a different slant to the Bible what we have here today is the token life of Jesus Christ amen and we've got to have that token life of Jesus Christ it's not in the knowledge it's in the very life of the Lamb coming back upon the believer and making the believer amen securing the believer because the Death Angel is coming amen but it seems that the lukewarmness has caused the people Amen to be content to be in Egypt and content to just be a part of the system and content amen but God doesn't want us to be content because we've got a land that we're going to we've got a promise of we've got a promise your name is already written in that in that land can you say man I I I I see today as I you know as we a as we listened to or read this morning to uh uh the uh uh and I I thought maybe I might have had it here amen uh uh brother uh yes I have it right here you know where where brother Ken had put that quote out amen uh to to to you children and your parents and amen and and and how we should be thankful for what God has has has given us you you see amen we don't want to get caught up in in societ Society to where we don't appreciate what God has given to us in this day amen friends we are not a part of this Society amen we are a called out church we are not part of this Leo sea lukewarm amen uh the a church system that has no feeling and has no conviction we're not a part of a people a man that is wondering aimlessly and and and claiming Christianity we have been separated by God unto himself can you say amen amen I I I say as Peter here this morning amen there in Acts 2 and 40 save yourself from this HT a generation this generation is going to perish can you say amen God has called you out to uh separated you to Jesus Christ he has separated you and cleansing you and preparing you for an exodus that is to come I believe we are in that Exodus even now can you say amen amen and so I think even our attitudes of of this generation amen should should not uh should not be that of the generation the scripture says in the last days amen there would be unth thankful folks and that there would be Disobedience to parents and that there would be amen just just very arrogant people amen the Bible says that they would just be arrogant he spent a whole lot of time Peter dealt with it and Paul dealt with it a and talking about the arrogance of the people of this of of of of of Le OA but but I I want to say save yourself from this onour generation this cursed generation because God has got something and well praise the Lord I I want you to think about this because amen if you've ever thought about the amen the anointing that is on the earth at the time of this Exodus amen now I I I I I'm I hope I'm making sense here this morning as we as we sort of paint the picture of Gloom because Israel was was under the task masters of Amen of slavery now they were G God's people but yet they were under they had been years and years under under the task masters of bondage but yet when the pillar of fire showed up to Earth it came and appeared unto Moses that Pillar of Fire was ready to deliver and to avenge his people and the blood of his people it was the amen the the pillar of fire was the logos of God it was the son of man anointing it was God coming down upon a human being and would be a deliverer he God would be in flesh and would be a deliverer unto the people can you say Amen now Satan had to had to counter plan to God's Rapture plan amen Satan had to do this you see about the time of Deliverance when God's Prophet was born there was an evil spirit that caused pharaoh to to look at amen uh the all of the children of Israel and and and he says there's getting too many of them and he and so he he he sent out a decree to kill all of the babies that are two years and younger amen kill all of those babies you see there was an anointing not that that that that Pharaoh knew that that Moses was God deliverer it was Satan knew the Exodus was coming and the anointing on the earth well praise the Lord there was a satanic anointing to stop God's anointing on the earth and he tried to destroy H uh God's amen God's anointed so he started killing the babies but when God's anointing is upon the Earth brother there is nothing that Satan can do to stop that anointing when God's anointing is upon the Earth amen there is nothing Satan can well that should make you want to shout if you're predestinated for this age Satan's going to come against you he's going to try to destroy you he's going to try to destroy your purpose he's going to try to destroy your plag God's plan but he can't destroy God's plan he can't destroy God's purpose it was Exodus time it was time to go to the promised land brother I say today amen no matter what Satan does there is a purpose of God and it is a rapturing purpose now you man the scripture says that as the as the time begin to Drew draw nigh Moses was now on the scene Moses had heard from the pillar of fire Amen on the in the burning bush now Moses is is is there he's preaching to the people amen and and and now he's declaring that the promise is at hand the people are thrilled they're listening to what the prophet has to say but soon they found out that Pharaoh still had power over them people okay amen if you you could read there in Exodus the the the fifth chapter and it begins to deal with it and amen and uh and and the people started getting free and they started thinking you know amen it's it's time to go Moses the son of the the son of man is upon him the anointing is upon him and amen and and it's time to leave we're going to leave and no doubt they started getting a little cocky and no doubt they started looking at their task Masters and saying amen we're fixing to leave here you know amen but then Pharaoh comes in and Pharaoh tries to Squatch their Revival tries to Squatch their faith amen and and and you if you start there at the sixth verse it says amen Exodus 5 and six and Pharaoh commanded the same day that the taskmasters of the people and their offers saying you shall no more give the people straw to make brick as here to for but let them go and gather straw for themselves and the tail of the brick which they did make uh their here too for he shall lay upon them and ye shall not diminish off thereof for they be idle therefore they cry let us go and sacrifice to our god there let let their more work be laid upon the men that they may labor therein and let them not regard vain words amen so what did he do about the time about the time for Exodus the taskmasters put more work upon the children of Israel to get their minds to get their hearts away from Deliverance if they can keep them B well praise the Lord Brother if the if the devil can keep you busy he can keep you busy at work he can keep you busy playing he can keep you busy keep you busy it'll keep your mind it'll will keep your expectation amen off of what God is doing and we're living in this age right now amen of modern convenience lukewarmness amen until you still got the chain you can have that chain on well praise the Lord Amen brother Bram says be free from your debts amen don't be adding more debts uh get free from your debts uh don't be adding more chains get free from your chains he friends we don't know what's going to happen but I'm here to tell you there's one thing about it amen I am not going to amen get more accustomed and more rooted in lay on a seea I've got a Rapture I've got a Rapture to attain to can you say amen amen oh yes don't keep your mind in that in that internet all the time amen that's Satan's trap it's a Taskmaster amen to keep you keep your minds are going and keep your thoughts are going until you don't have time to think about prayer you don't have time to think about church you don't have time to come to church early you're going to show up five minutes late because there's no desire to see God moving in the church there's no desire to come and pray ahead of time why because expectation has been drowned by amen the chains of tyranny can you say Amen am man let them labor let them not regard vain words 10th verse and the task masters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying amen thus sayth Pharaoh I will not give you straw go ye get you straw where where you find it yet not out of your work shall shall be diminished so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt together stubble instead of straw and the taskmasters hasted hasted them saying fulfill your work fulfill your daily task as when there was straw amen and the officers of the children of Israel which Pharaoh's taskmasters had said over them amen they were beaten and demanded wherefore have uh were beaten and demanded wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making bricks both yesterday and today as here to four then the officers of the children of Israel came and Cried unto Pharaoh saying amen wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants there's no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is thine own people but he said you are idle you are Idol therefore ye say let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord go therefore for now and work and there shall no straw be given you and you and yet ye shall deliver the tail of bricks and the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were uh that they were in evil case and after it was said ye shall not diminish ought from your bricks of your daily task are y'all catching amen what is going on here amen they weren't able to fulfill what they what what they were supposed to fulfill and and and here we are we can either be a generation of unfulfillment Amen because you're never going to be fulfilled as long as you're chasing as long as you are being demanded by the by the task masters of Time and and by the task masters of of popularity and by the task masters of Easy Living and by the task Masters amen of credit cards and the task Masters uh amen of of of you know just just downright lukewarmness uh you're never going to find your fulfillment you're never going to fulfill what your desire is here on this Earth there is a spirit that is driving L on a sea it's a spirit the scripture says in all of your money you're still you're still poor you're still blind you're still wretched you have nothing to offer you are under another could well can you say amen amen but I say today there is fulfillment there is a promise we've got to have a a a a desire and expectation for God to fulfill his word can you say Amen they turn around and they they met with Moses and Aaron man they they is Moses and Aaron's coming from Pharaoh's courts and they said unto him amen the Lord look on you and judge you because you have made our Our Savior you've you've made our you know our goodness Amen to be uphor in the eyes of pharaoh the eyes of his servant amen and now youth Place Moses you've placed a sword in the hand of pharaoh to kill us hallelujah amen but I I want to tell you God's got a prophet when God sends a prophet on the earth there's a reason for that it's at the evening time that the token has got to be the token of blood has got to be replied or applied can you say amen amen there Comes A Time God was fulfilling the prophecy it doesn't matter and here we stand today amen we we've got so many things in life that we've just got to do we've got to provide for our family we've got to provide we've got to do those things amen that's part of sister listen you can drop off you can drop off the grid if you want to amen but there ain't none of us that can live amen without all of this convenience of leot see you can't go without a phone anymore and you can't go and and just go hunt your turkey and deer and and do your fish you you can't do that where the society is set up by pharaoh to keep you busy can you say Amen but in it all you can't lose the expectation because the Exodus is upon us the Exodus is upon us can you say amen amen you see in the evening time God required the token of blood Israel had heard God's Prophet they had seen the Vindicated signs and wonders and God's word was proven to be so real and so true amen oh Hallelujah that couldn't see any other way because God had come down so supernaturally through Moses they they they they didn't have a question because by the time that it was all set and done they knew that God's voice was in Moses they knew that the Exodus time was coming and they were prepared and when Moses said you've got to slay that lamb and put it upon the door Post in the lentil they were no longer questioning they were no longer wondering now they had seen the supernatural in Moses Ministry they had seen they knew that he was in connection with God and when Moses said I want you to kill that lamb I want you to apply that blood and you've got to stay it beneath it can you say amen amen there was no more questioning I I I I say tonight or this morning amen should there be any more questions left in our hearts how many of us can say that God was in this prophet of this generation how many of us can say without one doubt that God raised that Prophet up to bring us thus sayeth the Lord for a Rapture now come on Church amen without one doubt I have zero doubts that God sent William brandom as Malachi 4 in this last day the scripture says he was to turn the hearts of the children back to the promise can you say amen amen now there is a parallel that is taking place because brother brandham after the opening of the seal says this is the this is the greatest message even after the seals when he preached on the token you've got to have the token yes sir as Moses was standing there amen death the cogs of God's prophetic wheel had ever so slowly ground up the cogs of the wheels of Prophecy had been moving so slowly until they would not have known it except God did send a prophet okay can you say amen amen but now amen the final blow was on Satan was fixing to do the final amen the the the death angel was fixing was was fixing to to ride and amen and Israel was going to have to face the final blow they were going to have to face death itself okay amen hallelujah mes told him said the death Angel's coming and there's no difference now there's there's there's no difference he doesn't care he doesn't care if you are Egyptian or Jew he's striking he's striking at midnight tonight he's going to come you you you stay in your house don't be taking the blood and putting it in a jar or in a five gallon can and say this is better this is better than just a little bit of blood amen displayed as a token ha I've got gallons of it here the requirement was to kill the lamb eat its flesh have have the have and apply that blood and you were to eat that Lamb with your staff in your hand your shoes on your feet you were there you were there with anticipation because God was fixing to bring the Exodus now once again this was not this was not amen just amen but God himself was on the earth oh can you say Amen when Moses came in and stood before Pharaoh he didn't say God said let my let his people go he stood up there and said first person Let My People Goen amen let my it was hallelujah what did God tell what did God tell Abraham he said your people's going to go into a land of bondage before he told him the prophecy before it ever happened that's right and he says but at the end of the 400 years I will deliver amen with a strong and mighty hand can you say Amen now this Prophet was saying amen you you got to apply that lamb you've got to apply that blood the death Angel's coming the death Angels got to come judgment is inevitable judgment has to come there's no way around it judgment must come because the Earth has spurned the mercy of of God but God s a prophet and he says I'm going to bring you Deliverance apply that blood amen apply the blood amen it'll be God's seal of protection against the death angel painted on the door Post in the L heat that lamb oh can you say Amen I say tonight get beneath that blood get beneath that blood he's striking he's striking he's striking this is the night time of America this is the night time of the Nations this is a night time of the world the death angel is striking oh Church of the Living God the hour has come where the token must be applied amen now you go back and you look you you you look in the in the Old Testament amen they were to they were to hold the they were to take that that lamb and they were to go through amen all of these days of of of of inspecting the lamb and they were to go through the I I I believe it was the seven days amen looking over the lamb and and and and and and and preparing the lamb but there came the time of the evening where they had to kill that lamb praise the Lord praise the Lord the time has come we've going through Seven Ages been a lot of inspecting of the lamp but this is the time to where the token has got to be applied right now it's not the chemistry of the blood as it was on that day when they applied when they painted the blood on the doorpost in the L but you see that was a that was a woolly lamb that was an animal lamb that but today it was God's perfect lamb not the chemistry of the blood that was soaked into the ground many many years ago man the literal blood is not what keeps Satan away the literal blood of Jesus Christ is that's already been spilt into the ground but it was the perfect life that was in that blood that made Jesus the perfect sacrifice and it's the perfect life that comes back upon the believer IM man that lets you know that that perfect sacrifice has represented you and that you are you are a a seal and you are clear and you are clean aren't you glad for the blood of Jesus aren't you glad that the blood has enough power to the blood has enough power to take away every stain that you you have in your past or any stain you'll ever have in your future that there was a blood and this is not this is not the blood of a of a woolly lamb that that that had to be amen that that was in in it had no soul that the the the woly lamb had no soul it it it it don't know right and wrong it don't know it don't know uh it can't it can't sin but it took God's Own perfect lamb God becoming a human yes sir God becoming a human and dying and paying your penalty paying the penalty because Exodus time was coming and there was no way that any of you were going to be leaving because there were leans on your life Satan says they're mine I've got I've got the leans I've got the leans against them oh yes they're your sons oh yes they can take their DNA all the way back yes they're yours but they're Sinners amen any of you that might have a house that you own and you've got you've got you've got the title deed amen but if you go have a link against it it doesn't matter what that title deed says the bank can say it is ours until the lean is taken care of and you had leans on your life I had leans on my life sin amen and the task Masters were saying there's no way you can have them back you've got to honor your own law Hallelujah there's no man worthy there's no man that can bring deliver them they've got sin they've all come short they've all I I'm going to take every one of them to hell but God comes down and says I'm going to pay the price I'm going to redeem them I'm going to Hallelujah and then he sends that token unto you thank Lord hallelujah Satan had no more hold on you because the leing have been struck off thank you Lord amen hallelujah you go get a plane ticket you go get a plane ticket you don't off you don't take money to the airplane gate no you take the token there you go and because you have the token they can scan that little card on their little machine and it says the ticket has already been paid for you see the blood has already been spilled but the token is required for rapure yeah you're not going to take the Son of God over you don't take Jesus Christ over there you don't he don't have to die again and then for everyone to see this is my token he's already paid the price right Hallelujah his spirit's the token his spirit is your guarantee yeah of rapture that's right it's the it's the very possession oh praise the Lord the token says that the perfect lamb took care of my sin debt the leans have been stripped off the perfect life of that blood is in me death is currently presently present tense right now tking he doesn't care what denomination you are he doesn't care whether you're Den non denomination he doesn't care if you're a tape church member or if you're a virtual church

family heritage amen of being a cockeran or or being an Apple gate or are you willing to lay it all aside and say I want the token [Applause] life man there so many too many today that so arrogantly display their political party affiliation and they arrogantly display their denominational Church spirits and amen they they you know even family Spirits they become so defensive their family no matter whether they're right or wrong they're going man we're going to defend our family that's right man so entrenched in themselves that they stink they're no good to God they're no good to mankind amen only thing they worried about is my family and amen but I want to tell you right now M and daddies you better start getting those children you better get those children under the blood you better get those children under the life of God it better be more important to you amen than a family heritage it better be more important to you than a name that that that that that that's behind their their first name it better be more important you better get the life of the Lamb over their house can you say amen amen I'm going to tell you fighting for your own rights and your family's rights and having that arrogant Spirit man is a part of the task Masters brother brownon says you could say I'm a Jew I'm a Jew amen my lineage goes all the way back on that day it didn't matter on that day it did not matter you could say I'm a Hebrew that didn't nothing matter good point Come On Church come on church amen they could they could say they could pull the men aside man the man could say I want you to I want you you want you men to come back and you you see the evidence I'm a circumcised Jew amen that's all that's required not on that day that's right on that day and the church can say I'm a Believer the church can say I I believe God but if you don't have that token life in you you don't have that life of Jesus Christ pulsating in your veins and in your heart you will not make a Rapture that's yes I'm not comfortable seeing people sitting in a church unmoved when the son of man presence of God is among us when the Holy Ghost is here Among Us I'm not comfortable with my grandchildren until they get the Holy Ghost I'm not comfortable I'm not comfortable with any of your children sitting in this church not on a log amen and the life of God can't even touch him and make a make make a servant life out of them and can't even can't even Point them to God for amen where tears are streaming down their faces well I'm preaching y'all might as well amen I can't be satisfied because there is a life token that must be [Applause] had either you've got the ticket or you don't that's right either the life of God is pulsating in you to please him and that love for his word is there and the desire for him is there or it is not it's plain and simple you cannot have the token and not know about it the token must be displayed Hallelujah well praise the Lord can you say amen hallelujah amen not belonging to to a message Church hallelujah praise the Lord only the token life of the Lamb only that lamb Hallelujah brother brandham says now in the token he says today the Holy Ghost is God's covenant with God's covenant people the Holy Ghost the life of the resurrected Christ has got to be displ played in the church among the people making him the same yesterday today and forever no matter how loyal of a member you are you might be whatever maybe a good man good woman sure that is fine we appreciate that but only the token will keep you alive God's token yes sir you might be a student of the Bible you might be a good person you could even be the president you could be any anything you want there is no excuses when God started the Exodus from Egypt calling out Israel from Egypt to his Promised Land there was no excuses and every man had to display the blood you want to stay alive and lay out a sea when the death angel is striking you've got to have the life yes sir because death is striking everybody else this message is not a dogmatic teaching this message is not another opinion come on when I'm up here preaching every Sunday morning I am not giving you another opinion or another translation of the Bible all right brother come on this is God's message pointing you to a token life amen and there must be a life that is displaying the holy spirit amen yes sir brother bam says I'm trying to press your minds friends that the hour has struck that something has got to be done by it we do we must do something it's either in or out that's all the hour has come where the token must be there if this church ever expects to remain alive and until Jesus comes the token will have to be here he's talking to the brandom Tabernacle if this church expects to be existing and Alive okay it's going to have to have the token life all right amen well praise the Lord token life is more than just living a good life buddy that is called sanctification sanctification is when you quit your sinning sanctification is when you decide that God's word is more important than you sanctification is when you left drugs and alcohol and you left sin behind that's the second stage of Grace that's right but the token life is where the life of God the very life of rapture is dwelling in you and that perfect life of Christ I'm no longer mine but I'm his it's no longer about me but it's about him it's no longer about what I am it's God thy will be done I do not my meat is not to do my own will my meat is to do the will of the father amen well Hallelujah I was hoping it'd be a little bit more shouting this morning but hallelujah amen now I want you to pain yourself amen don't be going to sleep on me yet this is this I I I want to tell you the anointing is here this morning praise the Lord the hour has come where the blood the token must be there amen it says in this church if this church ever exists expects to remain alive until Jesus comes the token will have to be here you he he goes on and says you you you'd better really have the token shining but the hour is here for the Exodus and this time we're going to a Promised Land the promise of eternal life this token this token the holy ghost shows that Jesus has met every requirement for us that we are in our nature Fallen Sons of God and we have no power within us we have no life within us we are Fallen race of people from Adam but when we can see when we can display the token the word a and we become the same shows that Jesus Christ has met the requirement for our sin and death and has displayed his token within us oh how simple it can be you are condemned you you we are condemned we're all condemned there is no way to save our ourselves God sent us a token he killed his son at Calvary for us and the life that was in that blood that was shed at Calvary has come back to be a token upon us can you say Amen now the first church had served their time under the Son of God under the the the Son of God which brother brandham would say would be the Holy Ghost interceding for the seven Church ages you mind it would be the spirit that was in Christ and amen that Spirit of intercession and Romans 88:9 says the spirit amen if you want to go and put that up there sister keys this the the spirit man uh Romans 89 but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit of Christ will in you it so be that Spirit uh now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his uh I think it's 26 I'm sorry sister Keith am man the 26th verse likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know uh not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession with groanings brother brandham taught that the Son of God that Christ has amen the spirit of Christ is down here amen living his life interceding for us throughout the church ages amen and but he also said that the son of man was that original anointing that was upon Christ and that church that first church before amen as we have pointed out to you before The Seven Ages even began there was that Pentecostal church at the beginning man that God deemed perfect he didn't even have anything to say against it now am man as we have mentioned here a time or two in the last couple Wednesdays is it wasn't that there was the not the human element there were devils in when Jesus crowd in Jesus church there was a Judas right there when when when Jesus was on the earth amen and and and but that church was free that first church amen was under that same son of man anointing the L had been slain and God had come back upon that church amen they were the perfect Church they were the anointed Church they were the Earthly body of the invisible God there were signs and wonders there were the power of the Holy Spirit upon them but after they fail they were still the church they were still his but they weren't walking in the fullness of the word anymore they weren't walking and they they substituted the government of the word in that early in that early age already left their first love to Christ the word and are now amen beginning to heed to to men and and the whisperings of the Antichrist amen by the time they got to that second age they were already following the leadership of men amen they were walking in the permissive will amen and not the perfect will the light of the word had been substituted righten now brother Brenham says with these principles in mind we start to trace the church through the various Seven Ages the birth of the church was at Pentecost as the first Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God and was undefiled for a brief span so was Christ the last Adam given a bride pure and freshed at Pentecost and she remains separate and undefiled for some time amen how long this continued we do not know but one day even as Eve was tempted and seduced by Satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit amen at John 4 and3 it says there this is that Spirit of the Antichrist wherefore you have heard that it should come and even now is already in the world Amen Jes Jesus said concerning his his his bride in the first age Revelations 2 and 4 I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy First Love remember somebody say remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent this church was that the church was in that first age already a fallen woman Satan had gotten to Eve before Adam even now as Satan seduces the church the bride of Christ before the marriage of the supper of the lamb and what specifically was in her midst that caused her to fall what but Revelations 2:6 the Deeds of the nicians already that first church had turned from following the pure word of God they turned from God's demands of a church absolutely dependent upon Him depending entirely upon God to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from Human government to nickon ISM which is an organiz organizing a a human government within the church which uh which as all governments do legislate for the people they they did exactly what Israel did and they took the expediency of the human government instead of the word and the spirit now this is the first church age they started out they started out under this son of man anoint it was God in flesh amen the son of man but now we go through the Seven Ages brother brandham says he is serving the church has served the term Seven Ages with the Son of God okay interceding it ain't perfect now I love this I love this listen to what brother brandham says death has already set in but he said death had entered how do we know do we not hear the voice of the spirit raised in that first age for all who will hear as he is calling to him that overcometh will I give to eat the Tree of Life in The Paradise of God the church had already emed too deeply in the the tree of death or the denominational false Vine whose end is the Lake of Fire and there was but but somebody say but there's no chair of them with a flaming swords to guard the tree of life now God does not depart from the midst of the church as he departed from Eden Eden oh no he will ever be in the midst of his church till the final age until that time he caused to all to come okay so so Adam when e fail all of a sudden there was no there was no mercy but when this church fail God says no I'm not leaving I'm walking in and out of those church I'm walking through the candlesticks come on he's not going to be as the son of man where it's the true word living in flesh but now it's going to be the Son of God that Holy Ghost that is amen amen anointing partial words an well praise the Lord amen now now they're they're they're they're entrapped and they've got all kinds of things going on but the holy spir spirit is still among them amen are y'all with me yeah are y'all with me amen that false Vine brother let me just give you another one F Church age is that first Vine getting a hold it was teaching that the rulership of men was right it taught that the church had to be governed it taught the control over the people but instead of doing it God's way they simply took the authority and invested all the spiritual power in their own hands and come out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people they went right back to the old ER ironic system they become Antichrist for they deposed his media mediatorship and and imposed their own and God hated that amen man and and and and as he and as he goes he says the the Ephesians hated that and any True Believer will hate that too amen we would have to be Stone blind not to see that the same thing is at work All Through the Ages and right now it is worst of all what it was was organization they separated the people God's people are supposed to be one by one Spirit they're baptized into one body everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is to be have the participation and the worship of God but men wanted to have preeminence so they took over the control and Bishops became archbishops and with imposing titles and and they bypassed the word of God and taught their own doctrines and they got the people to obey them until the time come that their way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days of Pentecost these Deeds were becoming were the beginning of apostolic succession the apostolic succession is one easy and quick step to the church membership as means to the saving grace and the Word was reduced to a Creed and the Antichrist by his Spirit was predominating the church and this is what the church has gone through for Seven Ages come on they had a chain yes sir they were dragging the chain alone they were back under the the the dogmas they were under the control the task Masters has been dragging this that they have been dragging the chains of the task Masters for seven Church ages that's right come on that's right Hallelujah y'all still with me amen but brother brandham says the token could not the token message could not have been preached till after the Seven Seals okay okay well praise the Lorden why it was no longer partial word giving a substitute lamb but now it is perfect word bringing Christ back to his church that's right amen well praise the Lord amen it was a partial word that gave a substitute lamb the Old Testament could only have a substitute lamb until the fullness of the word come in the body of Jesus Christ it was only a partial lamb it was a partial word it was a part thousands and thousands and thousands of lambs were killed for atonement the Old Testament believer was accepted by God through those Lambs okay but this partial word provided a substitute lamb and it only rolled sin ahead are you hearing me Hallelujah It could only roll sin ahead but when the perfect lamb came amen word made flesh word living when he when that lamb the bi well praise the Bible says that when Jesus was hanging on Calvary that the veil was rent in the temple it rent from top to bottom exposing The Mercy Seat allowing the people to see God is not [Applause] there God was hanging on Calvary now now here's the crazy thing Jesus died on the same day that they killed the lamb Jesus was hanging on Calvary the same day they took the woly lamb and the priest was going through the ceremony fixing to walk in behind the veil when the lightning of the pillar of fire came down and ripped that Veil open showing and exposing it all to the whole world that the blood on that Mercy Seat will not work anymore The Mercy Seat was now in the body of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ was living on Calvary oh come on church now every it wasn't that all the B all of the past years were in vain it just that it finally came up to the perfect one right can you say Amen now when Jesus was crucified all of the Old Testament shedding of blood all of the Old Testament priesthood it stopped it done away it was it was finished it was done can you say Amen now watch Amen brother Brandon would say in the indictment he says now how appropriate it was now showing that Jerusalem was ceasing when it was in effect until that hour the blood of the Lamb was all right until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done there is a new one and the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds and they were condemning and doing the very thing that they had to do when they crucified the word the atonement came into effect now now y'all stay with me a little longer now good and then brother Bram stops and he says God be blessed for seeing this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day because the churches is doing the same thing today until the hour that the organization religion is condemning and prove to be sacrificing Christ's word and from then on comes the word and the word only from the Pascal lamb passed away Christ become our lamb at the day of crucifixion and the day that the do denomination crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed instead of the word that's the day when the word comes into full effect that's just been recently okay wow now are y'all understanding the blood I'm we're using Brother Brandon's using the types he's he's inditing this generation he's using the types type that the old Pascal lamb the old woy lamb had served its time until now he's making the point we have had the intercession for all seven ages not in the perfect will of God man's teachings and dogmas Revival and death Revival and death Luther came up brought a portion of the word brought a portion of the word but the Holy Spirit could not now it was in it was in the it was in the beginning stages but it was not the original okay the original Pentecost was the church that God had in mind all right now it's stumble now it's just stumble we've had all of these ages but God's desire is for a bride time Rapture time Exodus time right well come on Church hallelujah oh yeah are yall are you hearing me he's been interceding but now watch I want you to catch this amen now they could say you know well I I'm doing it the way that Abraham Isaac and Jacob done it it wouldn't work right they could say we're doing it the way Moses said to do it it wouldn't work right you mean to tell me Moses way doesn't work anymore no this is another day it's the perfect word can you say Amen now what happened now I want you to I I I I I I I I love this the scripture says there in St John 1 and 32 and John bear record saying I saw the lamb descending from heaven like a dove and it Abode that word abode is to a permanent dwelling upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah yes sir John 1:29 and John says Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world it was the word coming it rested hear me young people the anointing rested upon the prophets and they preached the word they weren't filled with the Holy Ghost the anointing rested upon Isaiah the anointing rested upon Jeremiah but that day and that anointing would leave them but that day the Holy Ghost came and remain Luther the Holy Ghost would come and rest Pentecost the Holy Ghost would come and rest okay 1906 the Holy Ghost would come upon that Spirit man but they could still have all their denominations and they could still have all of their are you hearing me on yes sir but God says I'm going to return turn back to the church what did Brother brandom tell us he's he's comes in three sons names yes son of man Son of God Son of David he says before he come before be between the Son of God and the son of David the scripture says according to 11 uh uh Luke 17:30 but as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the the son of man brother brandham says right in between the son of David and the Son of God there's going to come a son of man where the genuine Holy Ghost is going to live this is not the pit this is not leot of Pentecost this is a church that God has promised come on we've had Luther but that was partial word we had Wesley partial word we had 1906 partial word but there has to come a son of man Revelations 101 Hallelujah the mighty Angel himself coming down not with a closed book but an open book the same Jesus was the seven seal is that not right he was the mystery of God revealed in the bride coming of Christ it's the holy spirit in word form back in you again amen not partial this is Exodus time he said in the token this message could not be preached in Luther's age Wesley's age or in Pentecost are amen right it could only come are y'all catching me this is not a learning this is is an anointing it's not just it's not an anointing let me just it's the whole Hallelujah brother Brandon put it this way he says justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost and this is verbatim okay the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost him self at bride time sanctification made way or justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism but the baptism made way for the word itself the Holy Ghost to come to an exodus people amen hallelujah oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah the veil was Ren because the real genuine Lamb of God was hanging in plain view on Calvary the real Mercy Seat when God had paid the price himself and become one of us and had manifested himself as a man to get acquainted with us and to be acquainted with him The Mercy Seat was now in plain view of all Israel on that day of atonement Hallelujah and when he says it is finished Oh Glory to God all of those who were under the Old Testament wooly Lambs all of the prophets all of the Saints everyone that had been under the permissive will Under The Substitute lamb they all came up in the resurrection when Jesus came up in the resurrection he was that fullness that brought them what did Paul say Paul says they without us cannot be made perfect these guys cannot Rapture until you come in your Exodus this is not the time to be sitting still this is not the time to be idle this is not the time to be lukewarm right this is not the time to be sitting in church with glossy eyes it's Exodus time Matthew 27 and 50 talks about when he Jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yeld up The Ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twang from top to bottom the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept a Rose and they came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many can you sayen well glory to God oh glory to God now so the church we've gone through the death and the life we've it's coming and gone it's com and gone through all the ages but we're still under the bondages we've still been under the task Masters I just want to tell you the task Master's Days Are Over there'll be no more Wars there will be no more cancers of the eyes or the brain there'll be no more Parkinson there'll be no more there'll be no more sin and sickness there'll be no more Devils to torment us this is not just another Revival and death This Is The Exodus Hallelujah this is this is not this this we don't have to go lay mama in the grave and been married to her for so many years

whatever went to the grave and they're depending upon this time they're depending upon this time when the church will understand that we are in the bright coming the bride age when we're when we're what does bride age mean anyways it means we've come to the completion of the [Applause] plant it's not another age we're still in the seventh this is the seventh one is going down the other is going

token Abad the token could not be applied until Revelations 10:7 coming down with the open book handing it to then could you be sealed because you're not under a man's opinion that's right you're back under the same son of man that you that started the church right that's right oh how our thoughts should be so Anchored In Christ Our Hearts our hearts oh I'm thankful I'm thankful for the holy ghost that has interceded mediating pouring out his Spirit sending Messengers trying to get the church back in order I appreciate the holy he said I'm not leaving like I did Eden I'm not leaving like I did Eden ain't going there I'm going to stay and I'm going to restore I'm going to restore I'm not leaving I'll be here to the very end and I'm going to send Messengers they're only going to have just a little bit of this and a little bit of Truth here and a little I'm going to keep sending them but I'm coming back there's coming a time where she's going to come back to the original I'm going to restore her I'm going to bring her back and she's going to be that woman that I had in my mind at the beginning can you say Amen oh my do you love him amen oh my now brother brandham would say talking about about the old lamb the old the old system it was it was in effect until that hour when the blood of the Lamb was all right until that day but at the crucifixion it changes amen amen oh bless the Lord we stand here sit here this morning if you can't see this destruction in the land now this message is not to tell you make you feel like you don't have the Holy Ghost if you've got the Holy Ghost don't you let the devil take you out of it but if you don't have the Holy Ghost and there's nothing you know you know when the stir has hit you where it changed you from life into death until you lost you lost you you you you you you lost interest in the things of the world and sin and your life become in him you know when that happened it's a display you can't receive the Holy Ghost and not know it that's right it's not an emotional workup it's not something that happens your life has been changed you become a servant to you become a slave to him in his word sometime the old Eagle Eye can get damned that's right sometimes the old Eagle Eye can say I've been under this Blood a long time is it really don't don't turn the television on brother Randon says if the tokens applied you're going to kick the television out he says if the tell if if if you've got if if the if the token's been applied you're you're going to you're you're going to kick the little novels out that's what he said he said when the token has been applied you are serious you have got the staff in hand you've got the shoes on your feet and you're waiting at any minute you don't know when you don't know how but you know it's coming if you don't have that token applied and you're only relying on your message understanding yes sir and an emotional workup that you had at a youth camp her at a service somewhere then

worshiping a man when you put brother brandom up there that was a son of man that God chose to reveal the son of man amen you can't make it any other way the mighty angel with the open book handed the book to that seventh Church age messenger he declared the message and the Mystery of God was finished and you and I have an open book today because of that we didn't get it here we got it here can you

of a doctor of divinity every kind there ain't nothing that can out shine that light and when that light is shining it just it just makes all the work of man look pretty stupid when you see that light shining it makes everything else I was there I was there I I I I I I was there trying to speak in tongues I was there wanting it I'm not saying that it's not wrong I I I I believe we should I believe that if we yield ourselves and understand and get the Revelation today I believe we're going to be speaking in tongues I believe we're going to see the non-spiritual GL I believe we should if we've got the token life it's got to be displayed now we we we we want to you know all the token messages we want to dis we want to talk about we want to talk about well you know if you got the token you're going to get rid of the TV you're going to get rid of your card games you're going to get rid of this and you're going to get rid of that but then we don't want to talk about the other token life he said and you will discipl Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you'll have Mark 16 that's what he and the token messages it's ours no yetem be said that we're just satisfied with quots and the life is not displayed in lives oh God this is the greatest time of all history this is the pride time this is the going home time this is the the defeating the devil on his own turf this is showing that God whooped the devil in Le oia well Glory if the musicians would come so thankful so thankful I would never I would never want to trade my upbringing I would never want to trade what I found in the isusa movement the Lord allowing me to come just like many of you have come through sin many of you have come through maybe a Baptist organization you've come through I come through Pentecost and I'm glad God allowed me to do that so that I would know the difference that there's just a that there's that that light has nothing compared to what we have here but I found that the Holy Ghost baptism performed Miracles and and I I I I I I have I don't I'm not going to read the rest of the quotes but brother brandham says now Wesley didn't criticize justification he simply added it to it he says in 1906 didn't criticize the justification and sanctification they simply added to it and he says brother we're here in this astronaut age because of what happened oh glory to God it was because they went through 6,000 years 6,000 years of horse and buggy horse and buggy six someone say 6,000 years horse and buggy and this last 75 years we have traded the horse and buggy for an automobile and an airplane are y'all hearing me and then an astronaut going to the brother brandom says this was a type in this age when the mysteries of God would be revealed God allowed that natural to show the spiritual he says horse and buggy Luther the car was Wesley the airplane got the got got the church off the ground with 1906 he says but we found that the 1906 when you go up you got to come back down he says and when you're T and when you're traveling on the airplane it gets bumpy and the clouds it can it can it can bring you back down because you can only go so high you got to you got to come back down Luther horse and buggy Wesley automobile Pentecostal airplane but he says in this day we've got an astronaut in the skies we don't have to come back down we're no gravity isn't pulling us back down we ain't he says Astron now we built on what they had we built and it's the same it was the same hor it was one horse maybe two horses yeah maybe four horses is pulling a carriage but he says now the car amen has got 350 horsepower he says and now they built the airplane it had had hundreds of horsepower and he says now this rocket amen it's taking all the power of the old putting it all in the capsule and now we're go soaring up in Heavenly places in this Eagle age soaring with God I'm here to tell you this is Exodus [Music] Time come on quit looking at the Pentecostals and and and being afraid you're going to be a Pentecostal why don't you get the Holy Ghost and if you need the and and if you start speaking in tongues it's okay because it's in the Bible yeah come on and if you and if you fall out and roll in the floor that's all right amen had a feeling they used to do a little bit of that well brother bandam says they they came crawling out the windows and everything else that's right I I just say give me the real thing they got at Pentecost all I want is to be done away with this old man I want the realities of Pentecost I want to know that the token is displayed don't hide it in the back part of my heart just play it let it be open let it be open let it let it Let Let It Be manifest for the world to see I want that Death Angel to know

Ghost just as real today as ever was too many of us we want to put we want to put the token or we want to put the son of man the son of man and we want to do away with him when a son of man left the Earth you're missing the point the messenger came to tell the church he is here John the Baptist came to say behold the that perfect Lamb of God the that brother Brenham come to say brother Brenham in in 1965 he's there he's he's he's there at Jack Moors and he and he tells how that the prophecy that was given years and years and years earlier how that your message will forun the second coming now brother brandham says remember the seventh angel must be on Earth at the same time of that coming I am not saying that there's not a physical return but the only coming you're going to see before the
