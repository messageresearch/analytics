[9:41] no matter
[9:46] yes
[9:47] Lord what it had in
[9:51] store. I will
[9:54] praise the
[9:57] Lord. Is that your attitude tonight?
[10:01] Hallelujah. No matter what I go through,
[10:04] I will have a praise on my lips. Amen. I
[10:08] like to go to prayer if I may. And
[10:10] before I go to prayer, I have a quote I'
[10:13] like to read. This is from the inside
[10:16] man. It says, "Let the faith, if I get
[10:18] this up here, just meet that condition
[10:21] and it will be for thou hast said, as
[10:23] thou hast believed in thy heart, so
[10:25] shall it be." And I pray that you'll
[10:28] grant that tonight and make the whole
[10:30] atmosphere here, Lord, a creative
[10:32] atmosphere of one soul and one mind and
[10:35] one purpose. How many's prayer is that
[10:36] tonight says, "Grant it, Lord. Hear my
[10:39] prayer. I pray this that you'll grant it
[10:42] to us in the name of the Lord Jesus
[10:44] Christ, thy beloved son." Amen. He
[10:46] continues on and says, "My heart so
[10:48] hungers to see that atmosphere." See,
[10:51] the atmosphere is what brings it. the
[10:54] atmosphere would bring if every person
[10:56] would get into one perfect harmony. Oh
[10:58] my, it would be settled. See, like the
[11:02] natural way for an egg to hatch is to
[11:03] put it under the hen and it will hatch
[11:06] because it is the
[11:08] atmosphere. It's it's warm. But you just
[11:11] wrap it in a blanket and keep it warm,
[11:13] it'll hatch anyway. Put it in an
[11:15] incubator and it'll hatch anyway. See,
[11:17] it's the atmosphere that brings the
[11:20] results. And he says, "If we can just
[11:22] get all of the doubt away from us here
[11:24] tonight, push everything out of the
[11:27] way." How about it tonight? I know we
[11:29] may be few in number, but if that's your
[11:32] prayer, say,
[11:33] "Lord, help me create that atmosphere
[11:35] here tonight." I believe God can move as
[11:37] he did this morning. Amen. Like to go to
[11:40] prayer and ask, brother Steve, if he
[11:43] would mind coming, we have a request
[11:45] from Brother Donald. He has a heart calf
[11:48] being put in on the 20th, possibly
[11:51] sooner. So, let's remember brother
[11:53] Donald and that God would either heal
[11:57] him completely before or or keep his
[11:59] hand on him through the surgery. And
[12:01] also a request from Brother Luke. He
[12:03] says he has a friend that's in need of
[12:05] prayer. So, let's remember that here
[12:07] tonight. Also from Sister Carol. This is
[12:10] Sister Thelma who is watching tonight.
[12:12] So, let's remember her.
[12:15] uh Trenton needs to surrender to the
[12:17] Lord and I have a testimony of a
[12:19] miracle. So, thank you for that. And are
[12:22] you want to tell the testimony? All
[12:36] right. I don't know where to start.
[12:42] I just can't contain myself right now.
[12:48] But this goes back to the teaching of
[12:51] brother window. When I first came to the
[12:54] Lord, I listened intently to everything
[12:57] that he said about prayer and our faith
[13:01] and everything.
[13:03] And one thing that always stuck with me
[13:05] is that I won't give Satan the glory by
[13:09] telling my problems and and and things
[13:13] that are bothering me or things that are
[13:15] come against me or whatever that I just
[13:18] give it to the Lord and give it with all
[13:21] my
[13:22] faith and that's how I operate my life.
[13:27] I I keep a lot of things to myself
[13:30] and I just put them before the Lord and
[13:35] um Satan's been fighting my family and
[13:38] myself a lot lately and I just didn't
[13:42] want to put it out there. I just wanted
[13:44] to um I I just go to toeto toe with him
[13:47] all the time. I say, "Satan, you're just
[13:49] ugly and you just you're a loser and you
[13:51] have no teeth and you have no claws and
[13:54] you have nothing and I hate you and I'm
[13:57] going to nail you to the floor of hell
[13:59] by the the very nails that you nail my
[14:01] Lord to the cross with." And don't you
[14:04] ever come back and you and your little
[14:06] imps and just That's how I talk to him
[14:08] every day. He's nothing. He's nothing.
[14:11] And that's how I treat him. He's
[14:13] nothing. Don't give him the glory by
[14:15] saying, "I hurt here and I I you know, I
[14:18] hate these people or I talk about them
[14:20] or whatever." Don't give him the glory
[14:22] that way. Give it give God the glory,
[14:24] but whatever you have. So, about a week
[14:27] or so ago, you'll remember I I put a
[14:30] prayer request in for my nephew that we
[14:34] had just found out that he was in
[14:36] intensive care in Minnesota. Nobody knew
[14:39] it and the family didn't know it. He
[14:41] when my sister died, he just went off on
[14:44] his own and started drinking and just
[14:47] doing everything that he could to not
[14:50] live in this world anymore. And and so
[14:53] we just been praying for him and and uh
[14:56] my sister called and said um they call
[14:58] her auntie mom because she took the
[15:00] place of my sister Sandy and that's
[15:03] Nupa. And uh she said you got to pray
[15:05] for JJ. She said his um he's been
[15:08] drinking a lot and she said his liver is
[15:12] failing and she said he's hanging on by
[15:14] a thread. He's we didn't know he was in
[15:16] intensive care and and uh in Minnesota
[15:20] and and she
[15:22] said we don't the family is just all
[15:24] beside themselves. They don't know what
[15:26] to do. And I said okay. I put it on the
[15:29] prayer request at church and I'm
[15:30] believing for a miracle for him. So,
[15:34] Friday she calls me and I was in Tulsa
[15:36] with Ruth and we were getting ready to
[15:39] go into um Burger Street, have a
[15:41] burger and as soon as I answered the
[15:45] phone, she was sobbing so hard and I
[15:48] thought, "Uhoh, something's happened."
[15:50] And uh I said, "What, Nupa? What? Tell
[15:53] me." And and she wouldn't she couldn't
[15:55] say anything. And I said, "Who is it?"
[15:58] Cuz her husband's in kind of in poor
[16:00] hell. And she said, "JJ." And I thought,
[16:03] "Uh oh, you know, he's gone." And uh she
[16:07] said, "The doctor called me and said
[16:09] that his liver is shutting down, his
[16:12] kidneys are shutting down, and his heart
[16:14] is
[16:16] having is having problems. He's filling
[16:18] up with fluid and everything." And she
[16:20] said, "They're moving him to Mayo
[16:21] Clinic." And she said, "To see what they
[16:24] can do for him. They've given him the
[16:26] last medicine that they could give him
[16:28] and everything." And uh she said, pray
[16:31] for him. And I and I said, "Okay, we're
[16:34] going to stop right here and now. We're
[16:35] going to pray." And I just went after
[16:37] the devil. I said, "You're alive." Just
[16:39] everything every name that I could call
[16:41] him. I said, "I'm standing toe-to-toe
[16:43] with you right now." And I'm looking you
[16:45] in the eye and I'm saying, "You let my
[16:47] family go. There's nothing that you can
[16:49] do to my family. There's no doubt.
[16:52] There's no fear. There's nothing that
[16:53] you can ever do to my family because I
[16:56] come a family of praying people." And I
[16:59] said, "We're children of God." And I
[17:01] stand up and I declare that today
[17:03] between for all heaven and earth and and
[17:07] hell that we are children of God. And I
[17:10] claim it right now. And Satan, you get
[17:12] away from him. You get away from that
[17:14] liver. You get away from his body. And
[17:16] you get away from my family. That
[17:18] doubt's not going to take hold. And
[17:21] today, we had a tremendous service this
[17:24] morning. I don't know about anybody
[17:26] else, but I'm about raptured out of here
[17:27] this
[17:28] morning. And I knew something powerful
[17:31] just happened. And I get home this
[17:34] afternoon and Sister Karen and they were
[17:36] over there and I was telling her about
[17:38] JJ and and I said, "I believe and and
[17:42] miracles and I I believe that
[17:44] something's going to happen for him."
[17:46] She just left and went out the door and
[17:48] and my phone rang and it was Newport.
[17:51] And she said she said they found a liver
[17:54] for JJ and I didn't even know he was on
[17:56] a transplant list. He
[17:58] wasn't. He was on his deathbed hanging
[18:01] on by a thread. And she said they found
[18:04] a liver for him. And she said they've
[18:06] got they're preparing him now for a
[18:08] liver transplant. And I thought, oh my
[18:11] god, what what else could we ask for?
[18:15] and and and we pray sometimes. I do in
[18:19] my hurriedness. I say, "Lord, you know,
[18:21] watch over my family and take care of
[18:23] them, you know, and and that's not
[18:25] praying. I'm sorry, but that's not
[18:27] praying." And and I just and I said,
[18:30] "Lord, forgive me for treating you
[18:33] so like it's insecure insecurity on my
[18:37] part, but forgive me for not praying and
[18:40] thanking you for the things that you're
[18:43] capable of in this world." And I said,
[18:46] "We call them miracles, but to you
[18:48] that's just answering prayer." And I
[18:51] said, "I thank you for that, Lord. And I
[18:53] and I promise you that my prayers are
[18:56] going to be I'm going to stop everything
[18:58] and I'm going to pray before and not
[19:00] just run and pray as I go, but stop and
[19:04] pray like I should. And I used to do
[19:06] that, but because of me and my wanting
[19:09] to help people and get going and busy,
[19:12] you know, I I don't do it anymore. But I
[19:15] thank God and I praise him today for
[19:18] that miracle. And I pray I claim JJ. I
[19:21] claim Trenton. I claim Delma. I claim
[19:24] all the ones that I stood in the gap for
[19:26] that are here today. You know, Caleb and
[19:30] Gideon, nobody in this town likes
[19:32] Gideon, but I kept saying he's going to
[19:34] serve the Lord one day. And you know, I
[19:37] pray Patrick sitting back there, you
[19:40] know, I I prayed for those people and
[19:43] they're here. It matters to God. Our
[19:45] prayers matter to God. So, let's pray
[19:48] more than we should, especially in this
[19:50] day and age. and I thank you for
[19:52] listening to me and I give God all the
[19:54] praise in Jesus name. Amen.
[20:04] Amen. Did you enjoy that? Amen. I got
[20:08] one more request here before we turn it
[20:09] to brother Steve. It's from mom says,
[20:11] "Pray for the Pope family. My sister's
[20:14] mother-in-law passed away this morning.
[20:17] So, let's remember all of these needs."
[20:19] And again, Sister Carol, thank you for
[20:21] sharing that testimony this morning.
[20:23] Just shows that God does care and he's
[20:25] still an on time God. Amen. So, if you
[20:27] have a need upon your heart here this
[20:29] morning, just make it known by the
[20:30] lifting of your hand. God bless
[20:35] you. Let us
[20:37] pray. Lord, we come before you tonight
[20:40] with humble hearts. Lord, we thank you
[20:42] for your love for us. Lord, we come here
[20:45] in one accord, Lord, one spirit. Lord, I
[20:48] give you praise and thank you, Lord.
[20:51] You've heard the request tonight, Lord.
[20:53] You know each one, Lord, of what's even
[20:56] spoken out of what's written down or
[20:58] anything, Lord. Before the foundation of
[21:01] the world, you knew what would take
[21:03] place. Thank you for the testimony
[21:06] tonight, Lord. Now, you always hear our
[21:09] prayers, Lord.
[21:11] Lord, you
[21:13] know what matters to us matters to you.
[21:16] Thank you for that, Lord. Thank you for
[21:18] your blessings upon us. All that you do
[21:22] for us, Lord. Sometimes we forget to say
[21:24] thank you. But Lord, we just want you to
[21:27] know how much we do love you, Lord.
[21:30] Lord, you're so great. And we're just
[21:32] nothing, Lord, without you. We bless
[21:35] your name. As you anoint this service
[21:37] tonight in Jesus name. Amen.
[21:44] Wherever I
[21:46] go, I'll praise him. Whenever I
[21:50] can, I'll praise him for his
[21:54] love surrounds me like a

[30:46] number
[30:48] one. That
[30:51] surely be
[30:53] [Music]
[30:54] me. And I thought I
[30:58] could
[31:00] be what I
[31:03] wanted to
[31:06] be. And I thought
[31:10] I could
[31:12] build
[31:15] online sink and
[31:18] sand, but I can't
[31:22] even
[31:24] walk without you. hold
[31:28] in my
[31:30] [Music]
[31:33] hand. And Lord, I can't even
[31:39] walk without you
[31:42] holding my hand.
[31:46] You see the
[31:48] mountains are too
[31:51] high and the
[31:54] valleyies do wide.
[31:58] put down on my
[32:03] knees. It's where
[32:05] I learn to
[32:09] stand. And I can't
[32:12] even
[32:14] walk without you
[32:17] holding my hand.
[32:24] You see, I
[32:26] thought that I'd
[32:29] done a whole lot
[32:32] on my
[32:35] own. And I thought
[32:38] I I'm surely making
[32:41] it
[32:44] all alone.
[32:48] And I thought
[32:49] of thought of
[32:52] myself as a
[32:56] mighty big
[32:58] man. But I can't
[33:02] even
[33:03] walk without you
[33:07] holding my
[33:12] hand. I know I can't
[33:16] even
[33:18] walk without you
[33:21] holding my
[33:24] hand. You see those
[33:27] mountains? They're so high and all of my
[33:33] valleyies are too wide.
[33:36] But down
[33:39] on my
[33:41] knees is where
[33:43] I learn to
[33:46] stand. And I can't
[33:50] even
[33:52] walk without you
[33:55] holding my hand.
[34:00] [Music]
[34:02] See, I
[34:04] thought that number
[34:07] one that it
[34:10] surely be
[34:13] me. And I thought
[34:15] I could
[34:18] be all I
[34:21] wanted to be.
[34:24] He and I thought
[34:27] I could
[34:29] build on this life
[34:33] seeking
[34:35] sand. But I can't
[34:39] even
[34:40] walk without you
[34:44] holding my hand.
[34:50] And Lord, I can't
[34:53] even
[34:55] walk without you
[34:58] holding my
[35:00] hand. You see my
[35:04] mountains are so high and all of my
[35:10] valleyies are too wide.
[35:14] But down
[35:16] on my
[35:18] knees, it's where
[35:21] I learn to
[35:24] stand. And I can't
[35:28] even
[35:29] walk without you
[35:33] holding my
[35:39] [Music]
[35:41] hand. Amen.
[35:44] So glad for his hand here tonight.
[35:47] Amen. Amen. Can't we sing this as the
[35:50] man of God comes? That
[35:51] G. Though my words fall
[35:57] short, I got nothing
[36:00] [Music]
[36:02] new. How could I
[36:07] express all my gratitude?
[36:13] I could sing these
[36:16] [Music]
[36:17] souls as I often
[36:22] do, but every soul bust
[36:28] in and you never
[36:30] [Music]
[36:33] do. So I throw up my hands, praise you
[36:38] again and again.
[36:41] Cuz all that I have is a
[36:46] [Music]
[36:49] hallelujah.
[36:53] Hallelujah. And I know it's not much.
[36:57] Have nothing else fit for a
[37:01] king except for a heart singing
[37:05] hallelujah.
[37:08] [Music]
[37:13] [Music]
[37:18] Hallelujah. I've got one response. How
[37:22] about it
[37:23] tonight? I've got just one
[37:28] move with my arms stretched
[37:32] wide. Oh, I will worship you.
[37:38] Oh, so I throw up my hands. Praise you
[37:43] again and
[37:45] again. Thank you, Lord. All that I have
[37:49] is a
[37:54] hallelujah.
[37:58] Hallelu. And I know it's not much. Have
[38:02] nothing else fit for a
[38:06] king except for a heart singing
[38:14] hallelujah.
[38:18] [Music]
[38:19] Hallelu. Come on my
[38:23] soul. Oh and come on my soul. Don't you
[38:27] get
[38:30] [Music]
[38:51] Yeah. I'm lost inside your voice.
[38:58] [Music]
[39:02] So I'll throw up my hand praise.
[39:07] [Music]
[39:22] I know it's
[39:26] not
[39:29] a except for my heart
[39:32] [Music]
[39:45] singing. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[39:48] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[39:52] Amen. Isn't he so wonderful here this
[39:56] evening? Praise the Lord. I'm so
[39:59] thankful that we can come with a joyful
[40:01] heart. Amen. Of praise and worship to
[40:05] him for truly he has been good to us.
[40:08] Salvation is his doing. He didn't have
[40:12] to do it. Amen. Well, I Yeah, I guess he
[40:16] did have to do it. Amen. He was so in
[40:19] love with you that he had to come down
[40:21] and and redeem you. Aren't you glad for
[40:24] that
[40:25] today? Amen. He so loves his people.
[40:30] Amen. That it caused him to leave his
[40:33] throne. Amen. To purchase redemption for
[40:37] you. I don't ever get tired of telling
[40:39] the story or preaching about the story.
[40:42] The whole thing is is is wrapped up in
[40:45] redemption. And I'm so thankful for that
[40:47] today. Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[40:49] we'll turn to the book of Matthew, the
[40:51] 14th chapter and the 34th verse. We're
[40:55] so glad to uh see everyone. The food was
[40:58] uh just awesome. We we sure enjoyed the
[41:02] food. And um Saman, would you run in
[41:05] there and get my hanky off my desk?
[41:07] Amen. Thank you, buddy.
[41:09] Um, so the fellowship was wonderful and
[41:14] um we're we appreciate our our wonderful
[41:17] sisters uh putting that together and and
[41:21] uh uh it I loved it. Amen. Let's look
[41:26] here in Matthew 14 and34. And when they
[41:29] were going over, they came into the land
[41:33] of Guanesseret. And when the man the men
[41:37] of that place had knowledge of him, they
[41:39] sent out into all the country
[41:41] roundabout, and brought unto him all
[41:43] that were diseased, and besought him,
[41:46] that they might only touch the hem of
[41:48] his garment. And as many as touched were
[41:52] made
[41:53] perfectly whole. Amen. Let's go to the
[41:56] Lord in prayer. Father, we just want to
[41:59] thank you today for your blessings.
[42:01] Thank you for Lord that your presence
[42:03] that we feel Lord we we sense a charge.
[42:07] The atmosphere Lord is charged with
[42:10] expectation and we thank you for that.
[42:13] Now Lord we know that you are the
[42:16] promise giver, the need supplier. And we
[42:19] come tonight Lord because we are wanting
[42:22] to partake of that grace that you have
[42:25] so graciously extolled to us. and we
[42:29] thank you for it, Lord. Now, Lord, we
[42:32] ask that you would be with us as we
[42:34] minister here tonight. Lord, help the
[42:37] hearer and the speaker in the name of
[42:39] the Lord Jesus. Can the church say amen
[42:43] and amen? God bless you. You can be
[42:45] seated, Simeon. If that's not in there,
[42:47] I
[42:49] it might not be in there. Praise the
[42:51] Lord. But um uh but that's okay. But if
[42:55] it's if if you don't see it in there.
[42:57] Amen. So I want to minister this this
[43:01] evening just to sort of uh go along with
[43:05] with my thought again this morning. An
[43:08] atmosphere I want to uh minister on at
[43:11] Well, thank you. Amen. An atmosphere
[43:13] that brings
[43:15] results and um Amen. As we talked about
[43:20] grace being accessed by faith. So Amen.
[43:25] We know that grace provided the the
[43:29] atonement in the wilderness. Grace
[43:32] provided the uh pillar of fire. Grace
[43:35] provided the prophet. Grace provided the
[43:38] the brazen serpent. Grace provided those
[43:40] things. But not all were partakers of
[43:44] that grace. Amen. because the scripture
[43:47] says there in in Hebrews 3 and Hebrews 4
[43:52] of an evil heart of unbelief. And so we
[43:56] we want to make sure that our hearts are
[44:00] pure before God
[44:02] always. Always we want a pure heart
[44:05] before God. Amen. Now the effects of the
[44:09] word can only
[44:12] uh the the the when I say the effects
[44:14] I'm talking about the results of the
[44:16] word can only come by faith. Amen. And
[44:19] and faith is not mental. Faith is the
[44:23] heart. And so we we we look at these at
[44:27] at at uh what I've just said. The
[44:31] results of the word can only be brought
[44:35] to pass or can only be fulfilled by
[44:39] faith because they are divine promises.
[44:42] And because they are divine promises,
[44:45] amen, they must be divinely fulfilled.
[44:48] Amen. They were divinely thought, they
[44:50] were divinely inspired, they were
[44:52] divinely spoken, and it must be divinely
[44:55] fulfilled. So if we want the promises to
[44:59] be fulfilled in us, amen, or to us or
[45:03] through us, then we
[45:07] must come in that supernatural faith
[45:11] that comes from the new birth. Now this
[45:13] is important now and this is why Amen.
[45:17] You cannot you cannot be a Christian
[45:19] with mental faith. You cannot make the
[45:22] rapture with mental faith. Everything
[45:25] about God is supernatural. Now I I know
[45:28] it's easy for us to just set in and and
[45:30] and it is you only only God knows his
[45:34] sheep. Amen. That's why that's why
[45:36] brother Brandham says in every church.
[45:38] Amen. There's three kinds of believers.
[45:41] Amen. The believer makebeliever and the
[45:44] unbeliever. He says in every
[45:45] congregation has that. And we all sat
[45:48] and we all Amen. or we all Amen. But
[45:51] only only one group has life. Only one
[45:56] group has life. And so I want us to make
[45:59] sure that we ain't the other two. Always
[46:02] make sure God let me access that grace.
[46:06] Amen. And and so um and and and you know
[46:11] and and and for your information, Amen.
[46:13] I I I believe that this church is the
[46:15] exempt from that rule. I believe we're
[46:17] all the elect of God in this church. God
[46:19] don't send me serpent seed to preach
[46:22] to. But the but the statement was made
[46:26] time and time and time again by brother
[46:30] Brandham what he is saying. Don't get
[46:33] comfortable with your works. Don't get
[46:37] comfortable. Amen. Just paying your dues
[46:41] and saying, "I'm fine, preacher. Why are
[46:43] you preaching at me, man? Why? Hey,
[46:45] what? Come on. Get off me." Or whatever.
[46:47] Amen. is because we we feel like we've
[46:50] arrived. But those with the life of God
[46:53] in them cannot become stagnant. When
[46:57] they become stagnant, their desire is
[47:00] screaming out, "God, give me the life
[47:03] again. Renew me, revive me, strengthen
[47:07] me, get me back where I belong."
[47:10] Now if that if their life is not there
[47:13] you will you will be satisfied with
[47:15] works and it does not matter. Amen. The
[47:19] the stagnant life and so what we want is
[47:24] life. Somebody shout yes
[47:27] life. Now amen. Grace has already put
[47:32] the seed into your heart. Amen. It holds
[47:36] that mystery of life. So, the seed is
[47:40] already there. Every one of you boys and
[47:42] girls, amen, whether you've received the
[47:44] Holy Ghost, uh even if there's adults
[47:46] that are seeking for the Holy Ghost,
[47:48] that seed of life is laying on the
[47:52] inside of you right now. Amen. Now,
[47:56] amen. It holds that mystery of life, but
[47:58] but it must have an atmosphere to live
[48:03] and thrive by. Amen. And so that's the
[48:06] reason why that this that the church as
[48:09] a whole we must create an atmosphere for
[48:15] transformation. Amen. Your homes should
[48:18] have an atmosphere for transformation.
[48:21] And only a son and daughter of God can
[48:24] create that atmosphere because you are
[48:28] miniature sons of God. You have faith
[48:32] that only comes from God. And you can
[48:35] create an atmosphere in your home. You
[48:38] create an atmosphere right here in the
[48:40] church. Amen. There is a there is a
[48:42] godscent atmosphere or godscent
[48:45] expectation and a cry for more of God.
[48:49] You cannot come and fit in with the
[48:51] lukewarm leosia. When God says, Amen,
[48:54] that there is a lukewarm group. It's
[48:56] going to be a lukewarm church lessa that
[49:00] that that has everything. And when God
[49:03] is on the outside knocking and they
[49:05] don't even want to open the door because
[49:07] they are satisfied with their works,
[49:10] they're satisfied singing their songs
[49:12] about him. Why do we need Why do we need
[49:15] God? Amen. We're singing songs about
[49:17] him. We've got everything down to the
[49:18] tea. We've got everything we need. Why
[49:20] do we need the supernatural? But
[49:22] friends, I say, I would rather not know
[49:25] how to sing. I'd rather not know how to
[49:27] preach. I'd rather not have any, amen,
[49:30] any goodness about me. and have Jesus
[49:33] Christ in my church, in my home, in my
[49:37] life. I want to be satisfied with him
[49:41] and him alone.
[49:43] Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. Now, in
[49:46] order to create that atmosphere for that
[49:49] new birth, especially those of us who
[49:51] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[49:53] Amen. Remember, we're preparing that
[49:55] soil. Amen. And we're tilling the ground
[49:58] and and and you're removing the rocks.
[50:00] If you if you're seeking the Holy Ghost
[50:02] here here that tonight, I I I say till
[50:05] up the old ground. Remove all the rocks
[50:08] out of your life. Amen. Let the light
[50:10] shine in and water the seed with praise.
[50:13] How How do I do that? Well, Amen. When
[50:15] the presence of God is in the building,
[50:17] you sure don't sit there with a with an
[50:20] I don't care attitude. You sure don't
[50:22] sit there, Amen. and act like you could
[50:24] care less whether God comes your way or
[50:26] not. Amen. The way that you're going to
[50:29] get God is by creating that atmosphere.
[50:32] Hallelujah. Amen. Jesus could do no
[50:35] great works in his in the city because
[50:38] Amen. there was no faith, but yet he
[50:41] would go to places where there was in
[50:43] charge of an atmosphere and there were
[50:46] miracles and there were healings and and
[50:49] there were things. But the Bible says
[50:51] Jesus could do no great works in his own
[50:55] city because a prophet is without honor
[50:59] in his own community.
[51:02] Jesus the great healer that was raising
[51:04] the dead, healing the sick, doing all of
[51:06] those things and his own community
[51:08] because he was common to them because
[51:11] they knew where he was born. They knew
[51:14] his family. They they heard all of the
[51:16] stories and he becomes so common that
[51:20] they did not create an atmosphere that
[51:23] would well praise the Lord. Oh dear God,
[51:26] don't let me hear this so much that God
[51:29] becomes so common that I just Amen. I I
[51:33] He's just another guy to me. Lord, let
[51:35] there be an anticipation. Let me create
[51:39] an atmosphere. Let there be a charge. If
[51:42] the grace has been extended to me, then
[51:45] God, let me reach out somehow and touch
[51:49] your garment. Can you say amen?
[51:53] Amen. Got to teal that ground up for
[51:56] that for that seed to grow. Y'all heard
[51:59] y'all heard the or read there where
[52:01] Jesus talked about it. Amen. that that
[52:04] the word was sown. Then some was on
[52:06] rocky ground, some was on wayside
[52:09] ground, some was on a thorny ground. But
[52:12] then there was then there was that
[52:13] fourth ground that was good ground,
[52:17] ground, tilled up ground. It was ground
[52:19] that was fertile and the word could grow
[52:23] in that ground. God, let your word grow
[52:27] in my ground. Let your word grow in me.
[52:32] Can you say
[52:33] amen? Now, David says, "We're trees
[52:37] planted. We're trees planted by the
[52:39] rivers of water." There in there in
[52:41] Psalms one and one. Blessed is the man
[52:44] that walks not in the counsel of the
[52:46] ungodly, nor standeth in the way of the
[52:48] sinners, nor sitth in the seat of the
[52:50] scornful, but his delight is in the law
[52:53] of the Lord. Now, he's he's showing he's
[52:55] showing the atmosphere that this man
[52:57] has, but his delight is in the law of
[53:00] the Lord. And in his law does he
[53:03] meditate day and night. You can't do
[53:06] that when you're on the internet all the
[53:07] time. You can't do that. Well, glory to
[53:10] God. You can't do that with hands
[53:12] folded. When you come to church, you
[53:14] can't do that. Amen. When the preachers
[53:16] preaching and you're just sitting there,
[53:17] Amen. and your mind is a mile away.
[53:19] Amen. That is not a tree that God's
[53:23] talking about. You've got to be planted.
[53:26] Planted by the rivers of water. You've
[53:29] got to you're meditating. What is medit?
[53:31] You know that word meditate actually?
[53:34] Amen. It it it means to to maul over and
[53:37] over. And you know what? You want to
[53:39] know what the example they give? Amen.
[53:41] They give the example of a cow.
[53:43] Hallelujah. Chewing the cud. Amen. They
[53:46] eat and eat and eat and they just sit
[53:48] there all day
[53:50] long and they're chewing the cud. They
[53:54] are they are they they
[53:56] are chewing the cud. That's what they're
[53:58] doing. Amen. But we're meditating. What
[54:01] are we doing when we are when we are
[54:03] taking God's word and we're muttering
[54:06] them and we're and and and we're and
[54:08] we're confessing them and we're thinking
[54:10] about them. Amen. It is it is a
[54:12] digesting. It is something that is
[54:15] within us. Amen. Meditating upon the
[54:17] laws of life. Meditating upon the
[54:20] goodness of God. Meditating upon the
[54:23] grace that was extended to me.
[54:26] Meditating. And you know what that does?
[54:28] That creates an atmosphere of
[54:31] expectation. I'm not a a serpent seed.
[54:34] I'm not the devil's child. I'm not a
[54:37] wannabe. I've been given a promise. I've
[54:40] been given authority. I'm going to stand
[54:43] upon his word. And what you're doing,
[54:46] you're creating a power right there in
[54:49] your situation.
[54:54] His delight is in the law of the Lord.
[54:56] And in his law does he meditate day and
[55:00] night. And he shall be like a tree that
[55:04] is planted by the rivers of water. And I
[55:08] love the way brother Brandham says
[55:10] rivers plural water singular. Rivers
[55:16] many of the blessings many bountiful
[55:19] that all comes from Jesus Christ.
[55:22] rivers,
[55:24] many blessings, bountiful rivers, amen,
[55:29] a sufficient supply, abundantly above
[55:32] all that you could think or ask. Amen.
[55:35] That's where those rivers are. Amen. And
[55:38] it comes from that living fountain,
[55:41] Jesus Christ,
[55:44] by grace. Now
[55:46] watch this
[55:48] man. Amen will bring forth his fruit in
[55:53] a
[55:54] season. Amen. And his leaf also shall
[55:59] not wither. And whatsoever he doeth
[56:02] shall prosper.
[56:04] There's an charge of faith. There's an
[56:08] atmosphere that is
[56:10] created. Amen. It's a generator because
[56:14] he's a son of God. And just as God is a
[56:17] creator, you are you are a miniature
[56:19] creator. You are you are
[56:22] generating supernatural power. You are
[56:26] generating supernatural life. You are
[56:30] generating Well, praise the Lord. Amen.
[56:33] How many times as brother Brandham
[56:35] talked about, Amen. were were these men
[56:38] uh uh Joshua didn't have to go and pray
[56:40] through? He already had the promise. He
[56:44] had been meditating upon that promise.
[56:46] God had already given him the charge
[56:48] through his word from Moses. Moses had
[56:51] already told him. Amen. Joshua, God is
[56:54] with you. God will keep you. God will be
[56:57] there with you. And when the enemy stood
[56:59] there, he didn't have to go pray and
[57:01] ask. Amen. If he was sufficient enough,
[57:04] he knew the word and all. Well, praise
[57:06] the Lord. And I just want to say, God,
[57:09] let me meditate upon your promise. God,
[57:12] let me meditate. I want to be a powerful
[57:15] Christian. I want this church to be a
[57:17] powerful church. And the only way it's
[57:20] going to do is by that atmosphere of
[57:23] faith down deep in your heart, not an
[57:26] excited preacher, an excited believer.
[57:30] Can you say amen?
[57:32] The atmosphere of faith comes from that
[57:35] new birth. Amen. As regenerated sons,
[57:39] daughters, you become a creator. Amen.
[57:42] You create the atmosphere for God to
[57:44] flow through you. The reason God created
[57:48] Adam, he needed a body that he could
[57:51] live and flow through. God created man
[57:54] to be the do the the the have dominion,
[57:57] the dominator. God created him for that.
[58:00] Amen. Adam was to rely upon that
[58:03] supernatural power of God within him.
[58:06] Hallelujah. He was created with a soul
[58:08] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[58:10] That's what your prophet said. The Holy
[58:12] Ghost was to rule through him. Are you
[58:15] hearing me? Amen. So friends, when you
[58:18] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[58:20] you are receiving the same power, the
[58:24] same authority that Adam had at the
[58:26] beginning. Amen. Oh hallelujah. Amen. I
[58:30] I I I love what what what brother
[58:32] Brandham says here. He says it's strange
[58:35] thing that how that people the type of
[58:37] people and what we do in our
[58:39] association. He says, "Now we have to
[58:41] face these facts that there is people
[58:43] that you just love to be around and
[58:45] there's people that's fine people and
[58:47] you love them, but yet there is
[58:49] something about that person, you just
[58:51] can't hardly stay around them." Amen.
[58:53] Now, we want to talk a fact. Now, but
[58:55] now the the reason that is is because
[58:57] the atmosphere that that individual
[58:59] himself herself create because you are a
[59:02] miniature creator. You are sons and
[59:04] daughters of God. No matter how far
[59:07] stoop you stooped in sin, you're still
[59:10] sons and daughters of God because you're
[59:12] fallen, degenerated in your soul and
[59:14] mind. But God is your creator. You're in
[59:18] your fallen estate. You're a lost,
[59:20] undone creation of God, dominated by the
[59:23] devil. That's right. But you're still
[59:25] sons and daughters of God. He was not
[59:28] willing that any of you should perish,
[59:29] but all come to repentance.
[59:32] And he's done everything that lays
[59:34] possible. For only God himself could do
[59:37] this to give the opportunities to the
[59:39] creature of his to accept and to be what
[59:42] he wants you to be back in your right
[59:44] estate again. Now, here it is. It's
[59:48] pretty sharp, but no person is in their
[59:50] right mental status until they have
[59:52] accepted the Lord Jesus. That's a deep
[59:54] word, but that's the truth. No person is
[59:57] mentally right until they have accepted
[1:00:00] Christ Jesus as personal savior. Amen.
[1:00:02] That that is true that he is the one he
[1:00:05] he in your created being. Amen. You'll
[1:00:07] be crazy to the world when you do that
[1:00:09] because you have to come out of the
[1:00:11] atmosphere you're in into this other
[1:00:13] atmosphere. Now, brother Random is
[1:00:15] telling us now you cannot be a Christian
[1:00:19] and and and and rule and reign with
[1:00:21] Christ even though you are a son. Amen.
[1:00:25] As long as you're in that chicken pin,
[1:00:28] as long as you are in the flesh, you are
[1:00:31] not going to rule and reign. You've got
[1:00:35] to come out of that atmosphere into that
[1:00:38] heavenly atmosphere.
[1:00:40] That means you got to quit judging
[1:00:41] things according to this and start
[1:00:43] judging things according to what God
[1:00:44] says. That means you've got to quit
[1:00:46] putting your own opinions to things and
[1:00:48] your own exclamation points and your own
[1:00:50] periods and your own commas. And it's
[1:00:52] time to just start believing what God
[1:00:54] says and trust in God or get out.
[1:00:59] Quit claiming to be a Christian and
[1:01:01] bringing a reproach on the name of God.
[1:01:04] Either be a son of God and rule and
[1:01:06] reign over the devil or just shut up
[1:01:09] with your testimony. Can you say amen?
[1:01:12] Amen. Amen. Why? Because God's called
[1:01:15] you to reign. The grace of God is upon
[1:01:18] you. Put your faith to work.
[1:01:22] God ain't got no hot bed plans.
[1:01:26] Amen. Where everything has got to go
[1:01:28] your way. You're going to have to stand
[1:01:29] up, put your big boy clothes on. Big
[1:01:33] girl clothes on and be a son and
[1:01:35] daughter of God.
[1:01:38] Amen. Now watch. He says, you've got to
[1:01:42] come out of the atmosphere you're in
[1:01:44] into this other atmosphere. And when you
[1:01:47] do that, God lifts you right up from the
[1:01:51] world and you live in a heavenly
[1:01:55] atmosphere.
[1:01:58] Why would I keep fighting for this
[1:02:01] atmosphere when I could be fighting for
[1:02:03] a heavenly
[1:02:05] atmosphere? Why would I want to be
[1:02:08] fighting for this, fighting for rights
[1:02:10] here when I can fight for my rights in
[1:02:12] this one? Well, glory to God. Can you
[1:02:16] say amen? Then to the world, you're just
[1:02:18] as contrary as that is. Amen. That is
[1:02:21] contrary to the word. Amen. Now, you
[1:02:23] want to do is be lifted up in Christ, an
[1:02:26] atmosphere to where you're happy, you're
[1:02:29] peaceful, and then in there, you create
[1:02:32] a situation. Amen. So, you're, brother,
[1:02:35] you you're you're never going to be you.
[1:02:38] And and and and let me just put it this
[1:02:39] way. You'll never be uh uh uh it'll
[1:02:43] never be the holy church or the holy
[1:02:45] person or the holy preacher or the holy
[1:02:49] deacon or the holy uh whatever it might
[1:02:52] be. There there is no such thing as as
[1:02:54] as as a holy church. Amen. And and and
[1:02:58] you're you're never going to be this
[1:03:00] great holy person. Amen. You're only the
[1:03:04] now now the Catholic Church refers
[1:03:05] itself to the holy church. Amen. A and
[1:03:09] there is none absolutely zilch, none
[1:03:13] holy but God.
[1:03:17] But when you when you get high and
[1:03:19] lifted up and think that your holiness,
[1:03:22] Amen. your approach and your way that
[1:03:25] you've got it sufficient and you don't
[1:03:27] need God, you're no longer holy
[1:03:31] because God is the only one holy. That's
[1:03:34] the reason we walk in humility.
[1:03:39] Okay. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. You
[1:03:42] you you want to you you you want to be
[1:03:44] subject to this world. Amen. Then just
[1:03:46] just remove God and start thinking that
[1:03:49] you that you've got it all put together.
[1:03:51] Well, Wendle Martin, you're a good
[1:03:52] singer. Wendle Martin, you're a good
[1:03:53] preacher. Wendle Martin, you're a you're
[1:03:55] you're the pastor of Pony uh church.
[1:03:57] Wendle Martin, you're this. And when and
[1:03:59] before you know it, well, I don't need
[1:04:00] to pray. I don't need to fast. I don't
[1:04:02] need to study. I don't need to do
[1:04:04] anything. Amen. Wendle Martin just got
[1:04:06] the the world by the tail. The moment
[1:04:08] the Wendle Martin begins to think that
[1:04:10] way. Well, first of all, it's a telltale
[1:04:12] sign that Wendle Martin's been
[1:04:14] backsliding for a long time. If he ever
[1:04:16] reaches that place, he's been
[1:04:18] backsliding a long time. Can you say
[1:04:20] amen? But I want to tell you, I want God
[1:04:22] in my walk. I want God in my talk. I
[1:04:24] want God in my preaching. I want God in
[1:04:27] my singing. I want God in my testimony.
[1:04:29] I want God in me. I want him flowing
[1:04:32] through me. I want him living through
[1:04:33] me. I need God. He makes me holy.
[1:04:41] Can you say
[1:04:42] amen? These biles, vile bodies will
[1:04:46] always be bodies of decay. No matter how
[1:04:50] spiritual you
[1:04:52] are, Amen. No matter how spiritual we
[1:04:54] get, Brother Steve, we're still living
[1:04:57] in vile bodies. Can you say amen?
[1:05:00] There's no such thing as a holy
[1:05:01] mountain. There's no such thing as a
[1:05:03] holy person. Well, it may be sacred
[1:05:06] because God came on the mountain. And
[1:05:08] that's where Peter and where they get
[1:05:10] that. The Catholic Church gets that
[1:05:11] from. Amen. From where Peter says we
[1:05:14] were on the holy mountain. Well, the
[1:05:16] mountain isn't holy. Amen. The mountain
[1:05:18] was holy because Christ was on the
[1:05:20] mountain. The anointing was on the
[1:05:22] mountain and it sanctified the whole
[1:05:24] Well, can you say amen? The ground that
[1:05:27] Moses was standing on was holy because
[1:05:29] the pillar of fire was on the ground.
[1:05:32] And I want to say if I am ever
[1:05:36] anything, it'll be because the pillar of
[1:05:39] fire has made me who I am. Oh, glory to
[1:05:43] God. That means I want to access it. I
[1:05:46] want to come in faith. I want to come
[1:05:48] with a pure heart. I need him. I want
[1:05:52] him. I need that holy God in me.
[1:06:00] Hallelujah. You children don't get
[1:06:03] satisfied just sitting on those pews
[1:06:05] without knowing the Holy Ghost, without
[1:06:08] the power of God flowing and fluctuating
[1:06:11] through your life. Amen.
[1:06:15] Don't sit still when you know he's here.
[1:06:19] reach out and say, "I need you. I need
[1:06:23] you." Can you say,
[1:06:25] "Man,
[1:06:27] hallelujah." Amen. Do you love him?
[1:06:32] Now, Brother Brandon would say, "It's
[1:06:35] not the Holy Church. It's the Holy
[1:06:36] Spirit in the church that makes it holy.
[1:06:38] It's not the holy man. It's the Holy
[1:06:40] Spirit in the man that does it. Not a
[1:06:43] holy man. There's no such a thing. It's
[1:06:44] a Holy Spirit." Peter was referring to
[1:06:47] this holy mountain because a holy God
[1:06:51] met them when the mountain had become
[1:06:54] sacred sand. Can you say amen? Sacred
[1:07:01] sand. Oh,
[1:07:04] glory. Do you have that place where God
[1:07:06] met
[1:07:07] you? Do you have a place where you can
[1:07:11] say, "God met me there.
[1:07:15] God, touch me there. Do you have the
[1:07:19] place? You've got to have a place. Every
[1:07:22] one of us, whether you're raised in a
[1:07:23] pew like me or whether you came off the
[1:07:25] streets, you've got to have a place to
[1:07:28] where you can say, "God met me. God met
[1:07:32] me." And then you've got to be able to
[1:07:35] say, "And God is greater to me today
[1:07:37] than he was the day that he met me."
[1:07:40] Because no matter where I go, I'm not
[1:07:42] even in the same church I was. I I I was
[1:07:45] a Pentecostal, amen, when God touched
[1:07:48] me. Oh, glory to God. But I could say
[1:07:51] the same holy God, amen, that touched me
[1:07:55] when I was a kid, baptized me with the
[1:07:58] Holy Ghost when I was 12 years old is
[1:08:00] the same God that is with me today. And
[1:08:03] he's sanctifying me and keeping me in
[1:08:06] his will. That is what we want.
[1:08:10] That new birth. Can you say amen?
[1:08:13] Hallelujah. that new birth. Amen. It's
[1:08:16] got to be a fellowship. Not a not a
[1:08:18] fellowship of some creed, but fellowship
[1:08:20] in Christ by the power of the
[1:08:21] resurrection. That's the thing that
[1:08:23] brings life. It brings birth before a
[1:08:26] birth can come. We realize it has to
[1:08:27] have death before birth. Birth is a
[1:08:29] mass. I don't care what kind of a birth
[1:08:31] it is. If it's in a pig pin or or
[1:08:34] wherever it is, it's it's a mass. And so
[1:08:36] is the new birth. It makes you do things
[1:08:39] you ordinarily wouldn't think you would
[1:08:41] do. It makes you it when when when you
[1:08:44] you're ready to die to yourself, then
[1:08:46] you are go going to be born again. You
[1:08:48] then you are born again a new creature
[1:08:50] in Christ Jesus. Then things open up and
[1:08:53] life becomes a new sight to you because
[1:08:57] you've accepted the person of Jesus
[1:08:58] Christ, not the not not the doctrine of
[1:09:00] Jesus Christ, the person of Jesus
[1:09:02] Christ, not some theory or some creed
[1:09:05] even to even the written word. It's got
[1:09:08] to be quickened by the Holy Spirit. No
[1:09:10] matter how much theology you've got,
[1:09:12] it's laying there dead. I I could have a
[1:09:15] handful of wheat until it gets into the
[1:09:18] process to where it can be quickened.
[1:09:20] The wheat will never live. And that's
[1:09:22] what you y'all understand what the
[1:09:23] prophet is saying. You can have the
[1:09:24] wheat here in your hand, but that's not
[1:09:26] what it takes. It it'll that that seed
[1:09:29] will never bring expectation. That seed
[1:09:31] will never want to grow. That seed will
[1:09:34] never want to to become a great plant.
[1:09:37] That seed will will know nothing about
[1:09:39] it. But you put it in the ground.
[1:09:42] Hallelujah. And you let it die and it
[1:09:44] begins to and you water it and the
[1:09:46] sunlight comes and you're keeping the
[1:09:48] atmosphere. And then when that seed
[1:09:50] comes up, its desire is to clothe be a
[1:09:54] grow to the sun. Its desire is to
[1:09:57] produce wheat. Its Can you say amen?
[1:10:02] Hallelujah. Oh, do you love him? Now he
[1:10:04] says, "Now you can have doctor's
[1:10:05] degrees, PH LL's. You what? whatever you
[1:10:08] wish to, but until the Holy Spirit comes
[1:10:10] upon that and quickens it to you, as a
[1:10:12] personal experience with God, then the
[1:10:13] wheat does no good. Your learning is in
[1:10:15] vain. As this Englishman was saying the
[1:10:17] other night, I was so astonished at that
[1:10:19] learning, all the learning he had as
[1:10:22] Paul. He had to forget all that he
[1:10:23] knowed in order to find Christ and do
[1:10:25] the things that he thought he wouldn't
[1:10:27] do. And that's the same way God does. He
[1:10:29] humiliates us in our educational
[1:10:32] system. Not that I'm trying to support
[1:10:34] ignorance, but I'm trying to tell you
[1:10:36] the difference. Education cannot bring
[1:10:39] life. It takes the spirit of God to
[1:10:42] bring life. And life must not come out
[1:10:45] of an intellectual revival. It's got to
[1:10:48] come out of the Bible. Word revival. And
[1:10:52] that word is the same yesterday, today,
[1:10:53] and forever. And when it falls today,
[1:10:56] and quickens, you get the same results
[1:10:58] as they did in Acts two. Someone shout
[1:10:59] hallelujah. Well, what what did they get
[1:11:01] in Acts two? They were speaking in
[1:11:03] tongues. Came out as drunk men. Amen.
[1:11:05] under the power and the influence of the
[1:11:06] Holy Ghost. They were speaking in
[1:11:08] tongues and other men could hear them
[1:11:09] and understand them in their own
[1:11:11] languages. Amen. The power of God was
[1:11:13] all over. It quickened their mortal
[1:11:15] bodies. They would never more be the
[1:11:17] same. These cowards were hiding in that
[1:11:19] upper room. But when they came out,
[1:11:20] Amen. every one of them died a martyr's
[1:11:23] death. It didn't matter anymore. Why?
[1:11:25] Their thoughts was that of God's.
[1:11:32] Oh, when life is dreary and life is
[1:11:34] empty and life, amen, is just going
[1:11:36] through, amen, there's just trial after
[1:11:38] trial, won't you come back in and say,
[1:11:41] "God, renew me. Let the life start
[1:11:43] flowing again. Let the power of God
[1:11:45] come. I want joy unspeakable and full of
[1:11:48] glory. I want this." Well, praise the
[1:11:50] Lord. I said you can still rejoice in
[1:11:52] your trial. Amen. You can be like
[1:11:54] Stephen. Amen. as he's being stoned to
[1:11:56] death and he falls to the ground and he
[1:11:59] looks up. He sees the heavens opened up.
[1:12:02] He sees Christ standing there. Welcome.
[1:12:04] What can you say? Amen. I say it don't
[1:12:07] matter what the trial is. It don't
[1:12:09] matter what the circumstance is. Greater
[1:12:12] is he in that sea than he that is in
[1:12:16] that ground.
[1:12:20] Can you say
[1:12:21] amen? The ground can do whatever it
[1:12:24] wants to do.
[1:12:25] But all it can do is create an
[1:12:28] atmosphere. He says now exactly it's
[1:12:31] always been it. It always will because
[1:12:32] it's the spirit of God that conditions
[1:12:34] the atmosphere. It takes atmosphere to
[1:12:36] do things friends. That's the reason you
[1:12:39] men are always taught bring your
[1:12:40] children here. Well certainly that's
[1:12:43] right. I was glad to see my daughter
[1:12:44] Rebecca come in and sat down just a few
[1:12:46] minutes ago. Some of you seen me wink at
[1:12:49] a woman was my daughter. So she come in
[1:12:51] and sat down and I I want her to receive
[1:12:54] the baptism of the spirit and that's why
[1:12:56] she's here in here in the meeting and
[1:12:59] that's the purpose of it. It takes an
[1:13:02] atmosphere. Oh, can you say amen? He
[1:13:05] said people that profess to come areuh
[1:13:08] are too starchy. They they seem to just
[1:13:11] say, "Well, yes, I believe." That is
[1:13:13] intellectual conception. It won't work.
[1:13:16] You've got to be born again. And when
[1:13:19] you're born, there is an enthusiasm that
[1:13:22] rises with that new birth and sets the
[1:13:26] soul of fire and takes all the
[1:13:28] indifferences away and isms and comes
[1:13:31] straight to Calvary, recognizes Christ
[1:13:33] with a burning love and a zeal for the
[1:13:36] lost and the fallen world. Can you say
[1:13:39] amen?
[1:13:41] Amen. When we see ourselves in
[1:13:45] that. Well, glory to God. Remember the
[1:13:47] story I told y'all of my my little uncle
[1:13:49] Nathan, man. And and how that he would
[1:13:53] be forever more changed? Drugs and
[1:13:56] alcohol taking him at a young age. Amen.
[1:14:00] But that night when he called, there was
[1:14:02] desperation. Well, praise the Lord. And
[1:14:05] I like to think that it was because he
[1:14:07] had two nephews. I was older than him,
[1:14:10] so I can't say little nephews. Amen. But
[1:14:12] me and Sean, we were Amen. We were
[1:14:15] always Hallelujah. trying to light his
[1:14:17] fire. Amen. And telling him about the
[1:14:20] Lord and telling him, "Well, glory to
[1:14:21] God." Amen. He had he had a mom and dad
[1:14:24] now. He had he had oh had had the
[1:14:27] atmosphere around him. Even when he was
[1:14:28] out in the world, we just kept on
[1:14:30] telling him that you're a son of God.
[1:14:32] Amen. And that night when God filled him
[1:14:33] with the Holy Ghost. Y'all remember the
[1:14:35] story I was telling you? Amen. How he
[1:14:37] kept trying to get it and couldn't get
[1:14:38] it. He just so awkward. But that night,
[1:14:41] that night or that Sunday morning when
[1:14:42] he got it, he about scared the rest of
[1:14:44] us to death. But when he jumped up and
[1:14:47] said, "I got it, Wendle. I got
[1:14:50] it." Hallelujah. Oh yes. Amen. It wasn't
[1:14:54] but a week or two later, the Lord took
[1:14:56] him home at the age of 19. But he went
[1:14:58] with an expectation. He went Amen. with
[1:15:02] a with a joy in his heart and and and
[1:15:04] and and witnessing and winning souls to
[1:15:07] Calvary. Can you say amen? Amen. Oh yes.
[1:15:11] The baptism of the Holy Ghost set me on
[1:15:13] fire. Amen. When I received the Holy
[1:15:15] Ghost, it set me a fire. I couldn't be
[1:15:17] happy anymore. I had to tell somebody. I
[1:15:20] had to be out. Amen. Sharing the good
[1:15:22] news, praying for somebody. Amen. What
[1:15:24] was up there was there was something in
[1:15:27] my soul that was burning. And I and
[1:15:29] brothers, I just got to tell you, I
[1:15:31] might be getting a little older. And I
[1:15:32] don't jump as as high as I used to jump.
[1:15:35] And I can't preach like I used to
[1:15:36] preach, but I'll tell you one thing.
[1:15:38] I've still got something on the inside
[1:15:40] of me that is screaming out, I love you.
[1:15:44] I love you. Can you say amen? It's the
[1:15:48] life of God. It's not education. It's
[1:15:51] not that I've got my name on a book.
[1:15:53] It's not that I'm just a pastor. I have
[1:15:57] met God.
[1:16:01] It's because of
[1:16:03] that that it's created an expectation.
[1:16:09] That expectation is like the
[1:16:11] expectation of blind
[1:16:13] Barnameus. Life had been cruel to him.
[1:16:16] Life was so
[1:16:20] cruel. His mama would tell
[1:16:24] him Bible
[1:16:27] stories and she created that atmosphere.
[1:16:29] Brother Brandham says the key to his
[1:16:33] victory was that he had a mama.
[1:16:37] That little blind boy had a mama that
[1:16:38] would take the time and put the boy on
[1:16:41] his lap on her
[1:16:43] lap. Says, "Let me tell
[1:16:45] you about
[1:16:47] Jehovah and what God used to do and what
[1:16:50] we we've known God to do." And he would
[1:16:55] talk about Elijah and the widow woman
[1:16:59] and the little boy was going was going
[1:17:02] to die.
[1:17:04] how that the little boy how God sent a
[1:17:06] prophet and because mama was praying
[1:17:11] crying out and God heard her expectation
[1:17:15] and God sent her a prophet and how that
[1:17:18] God had already already told before the
[1:17:22] prophet even got to the woman before the
[1:17:23] woman even knew what was going on the
[1:17:26] prayer was already answered because God
[1:17:28] had already told him he dried the brook
[1:17:30] up and he says now the brook is dried up
[1:17:32] here Elijah
[1:17:33] I've got a woman in Zerapath that is
[1:17:36] going to feed you the rest of them of
[1:17:38] the famine. She didn't know anything,
[1:17:41] but because of the atmosphere, because
[1:17:43] of the expectation, because of the cry
[1:17:46] her she was still praying and asking,
[1:17:48] but it was already answered. Well, glory
[1:17:50] be to God. How many in this building
[1:17:52] here tonight could have the answer
[1:17:54] already answered? Amen. You're still
[1:17:57] praying. You don't know it. But the
[1:18:00] answer because you've kept the attitude
[1:18:03] of faith. You've kept an atmosphere
[1:18:04] around you. You have rebuked that evil
[1:18:07] dark spirit from your mind and your
[1:18:09] heart and your family. And you are
[1:18:11] dedicated. You're dedicated to one thing
[1:18:14] and that's the life of God staying in
[1:18:16] your heart. The life of God staying in
[1:18:18] your heart. The life of God staying in
[1:18:20] your church. You are dedicated to that
[1:18:22] in the name of the Lord. And I want to
[1:18:24] say, let this church be dedicated to the
[1:18:28] life, the life of God, the power of God.
[1:18:32] I will not I refuse to pet any devils.
[1:18:37] God's given me authority to stand my
[1:18:41] ground against the enemy.
[1:18:45] Do you believe it?
[1:18:50] He she'd also tell him the story about
[1:18:54] the
[1:18:55] woman that was given that was good to
[1:18:57] the man of
[1:18:58] God.
[1:19:00] And because of her kindness, God gave
[1:19:05] the boy, gave her a child. She'd never
[1:19:09] been able to have a child, but gave her
[1:19:11] a child in her old
[1:19:13] age. Amen.
[1:19:15] child grew he grew sick, got a headache
[1:19:19] and he come home and he's in my head and
[1:19:21] my head and dad sent him back to the
[1:19:25] house with his mom and he died in her
[1:19:31] arms. And she said, "But you know
[1:19:35] what, little
[1:19:37] Barnameus, you know
[1:19:38] what? That mama had already knew Jehovah
[1:19:42] was still alive. and she knew that God's
[1:19:45] prophet was just right up there at Mount
[1:19:50] Carmel. She said she went and talked to
[1:19:52] her husband and her husband gave her
[1:19:53] permission. He's got the servants and
[1:19:56] they saddled up the donkeys. They went
[1:19:59] to go with and and that mama had so much
[1:20:01] expectation. She said, "Don't you salute
[1:20:04] any man or woman. Don't you go anywhere
[1:20:07] else. You go straight to that prophet of
[1:20:11] God." And little And the man says,
[1:20:14] "Well, what what what did she do with
[1:20:16] the baby? Did she take him with him?"
[1:20:17] No. No. She laid that baby on the
[1:20:21] prophet's bed.
[1:20:23] Hallelujah. She was going to go get that
[1:20:25] prophet. And that prophet was going to
[1:20:27] raise her miracle, her miracle boy up.
[1:20:31] And so here she went up and the the
[1:20:33] prophet sends his staff and or he he
[1:20:36] says sends this servant and as he sees
[1:20:38] her coming up making a making a beline
[1:20:40] up that mountain. And so he sends a
[1:20:43] servant. Is all well with you? Yes. Yes.
[1:20:45] Yes. Is all well with your husband? Yes.
[1:20:48] Is all well with your child? And she
[1:20:49] says, all is well. Now get me to the man
[1:20:53] of
[1:20:54] God. All is well. Just as long as I can
[1:20:58] get to the life of God. Well, the Holy
[1:21:00] Ghost wasn't poured out then. The Amen.
[1:21:03] The the the but the power of God was
[1:21:05] represented in that prophet. Aren't you
[1:21:07] glad that today, Amen, our prophet may
[1:21:10] be gone, but the life of God is with
[1:21:12] every one of you through the baptism of
[1:21:14] the Holy
[1:21:18] Ghost. Get me to
[1:21:20] God. So he sends Elisha or he sends he
[1:21:24] sends the the the the servant with with
[1:21:26] a staff and say, "Go lay my staff on
[1:21:28] it." She goes, "Nope. Ain't going to
[1:21:30] work." "No, no." She grabbed that man of
[1:21:33] God's legs and she says, "I'm not
[1:21:35] leaving until you leave. You're going
[1:21:38] with me. I've got that baby down there
[1:21:40] in that bed." Oh, can you imagine little
[1:21:42] B Barnameus just just picturing this in
[1:21:46] his little mind? Amen. He says, "What
[1:21:49] happened, mama?" Oh, the prophet went
[1:21:51] down there. She had such expectation,
[1:21:53] had such a faith that she wasn't going
[1:21:55] to be turned down. Oh my. What happened
[1:21:58] next, mama? Amen. And here, man, she he
[1:22:02] comes over there and he lays on the
[1:22:04] child and nothing happens. And he gets
[1:22:06] back up. Amen. And he lays down on the
[1:22:08] child again and nothing happens. He
[1:22:11] goes, "What? What's happening?" Amen.
[1:22:13] Mama, did did he did he did he live? Oh,
[1:22:16] there was an atmosphere of faith that
[1:22:18] was charging that prophet. He wasn't
[1:22:20] going to give up because there was a
[1:22:22] mama who had faith outside that door
[1:22:24] that was believing God for a miracle. He
[1:22:27] laid on that child the seventh time and
[1:22:29] the child started started uh uh sneezing
[1:22:32] and amen he and he and and he woke up
[1:22:34] and he come back to life. Oh my. Now,
[1:22:37] Brother Brandham says that night, Amen.
[1:22:40] was going over and over and he was
[1:22:42] meditating and meditated and meditated.
[1:22:46] Amen. Oh, glory to God. Amen. And there
[1:22:49] he was that morning. There he was that
[1:22:51] morning on that Jericho road and he was
[1:22:53] thinking, "I wonder if that prophet
[1:22:56] Elijah ever came down this very road. I
[1:23:00] wonder if one of those Oh, if we could
[1:23:03] just have if we could just have if there
[1:23:06] was a prophet that could help me. I know
[1:23:08] that I could see."
[1:23:13] Ram said that night before was just
[1:23:15] really strange as he dreamed so many
[1:23:18] dreams about seeing
[1:23:20] again and these things and he it got him
[1:23:23] so that he showed up there late got got
[1:23:26] late to his begging spot on the side of
[1:23:28] the road. He says a nice little girl
[1:23:31] seen him there staggering. someone had
[1:23:33] got his spot. And so a little girl came
[1:23:36] over and led him to a little rock in the
[1:23:38] sun. Amen. And he says, "What's the
[1:23:41] noise, little girl?" She goes, "Oh,
[1:23:44] that's that's that's Jesus. He's
[1:23:47] coming." And oh, you begin to hear. He
[1:23:50] goes, "I don't guess I know Jesus." He
[1:23:52] says, "He's the Messiah." Says, "The
[1:23:55] Messiah?" And he's sitting there and
[1:23:57] he's thinking, "Mama told me of a
[1:24:00] Messiah. Mama's been a long time gone
[1:24:02] now. She's been gone for a long time.
[1:24:04] But mama told me that if the Messiah
[1:24:07] were to ever come, he would have the
[1:24:10] power to heal my eyes. And there were
[1:24:13] people laughing at Jesus, making fun of
[1:24:16] him. And they were going and the
[1:24:18] multitude was pressing. He goes, "What's
[1:24:20] happening?" He says, "Oh, there's many
[1:24:21] trying to get to Jesus and his disciples
[1:24:23] trying to keep him
[1:24:25] away." He says, "Is is this the
[1:24:27] Messiah?" The little girl says, "Yes."
[1:24:31] Mama says, "This is the Messiah." And
[1:24:34] all of a sudden, he raises up. Now, he
[1:24:37] didn't have they didn't have blind
[1:24:38] glasses back then. They they didn't have
[1:24:40] they they they had a blind a blind
[1:24:43] garment. He took that that that garment
[1:24:45] and threw it off. And he screamed at
[1:24:50] Jesus, thou son of
[1:24:53] David, have mercy on me. Jesus, thou son
[1:24:57] of David. and so much that the that the
[1:24:59] multitudes, Amen. Amen. the hundreds and
[1:25:02] hundreds and hundreds that were all
[1:25:04] around him, Amen. they they his scream
[1:25:07] came out above all of it and Jesus
[1:25:12] stopped.
[1:25:18] And if we put it this way, Brother
[1:25:20] Brandon says when Jesus
[1:25:22] stopped, it wasn't because he heard
[1:25:25] blind Barnameus's voice.
[1:25:28] It was because his faith was screaming
[1:25:30] out so loud that it touched that
[1:25:33] supernatural God on the inside of Jesus.
[1:25:37] And he stopped and he looked
[1:25:40] around. Well, give you to
[1:25:43] God. Amen. Jesus, this disciples, come
[1:25:46] on. Don't stop. You'll start. Oh, no.
[1:25:48] That wasn't going to happen. And he
[1:25:50] began to scream. And you know what?
[1:25:52] Y'all know what happened? Well, you know
[1:25:53] what happened? Jesus healed blind
[1:25:55] Barameus.
[1:25:56] He healed blind Barnameus. Yes, sir.
[1:26:00] Well, glory be to God. The atmosphere of
[1:26:02] expectation, the atmosphere. Oh, yes.
[1:26:05] Oh, yes. If you've heard Amen. I when
[1:26:08] you hear of stories about how God
[1:26:11] touched me. Amen. And and and how that
[1:26:14] the Holy Ghost used to fall and and and
[1:26:16] and people used to speak in tongues and
[1:26:18] and the presence of God was around and
[1:26:20] there was a supernatural God. You can
[1:26:23] know, you can have an assurance that God
[1:26:26] still does it today. And we still
[1:26:29] believe in that. We just don't believe
[1:26:31] it the way the Pentecostals believe it.
[1:26:33] We believe God is able to take any one
[1:26:36] of your vessels and it'll be the holy
[1:26:39] God in your being and that can use you
[1:26:42] and anoint you for his glory.
[1:26:48] Hallelujah. Now, there's one thing about
[1:26:50] it. God doesn't want us to be church
[1:26:52] members. That's just not the way it is.
[1:26:54] Go read the whole Bible and you will not
[1:26:56] find one place where God wanted us to be
[1:26:59] church members.
[1:27:04] Hallelujah. But you will find that where
[1:27:07] the spirit of God came into
[1:27:10] people, crazy things
[1:27:12] happened. Supernatural things happened.
[1:27:15] The glory of the Lord was upon the well.
[1:27:17] Praise the name of the Lord, brother.
[1:27:19] That's the kind of expect expectation
[1:27:22] that I have. Amen. Brother brother
[1:27:24] brother Brandham would say, "Amen."
[1:27:26] They're in blind Barnameus. He said,
[1:27:27] "And when we think when we think of God,
[1:27:30] when we begin to dream the dreams of
[1:27:32] being well, when we begin to dream
[1:27:34] dreams of being saved, when we get to
[1:27:37] thinking about our sins and how cruel it
[1:27:39] is before God, that's when he draws
[1:27:42] near. That's when these disciples
[1:27:44] brokenhearted going down the road to
[1:27:47] Emmas that Jesus stepped out of the bush
[1:27:50] and begin to talk with him. Why? While
[1:27:52] they were thinking on him.
[1:27:57] Now unto him that is able to do
[1:27:58] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:28:00] would ask or think according to the
[1:28:03] power that workketh in
[1:28:07] us. God is a God of promises and his
[1:28:10] promises are yes and amen.
[1:28:13] There's no variableness to God. He
[1:28:15] doesn't change his
[1:28:17] mind. Numbers 23 and 19. God is not a
[1:28:20] man that he should lie. Somebody say,
[1:28:24] "God is not a man that he should lie.
[1:28:28] Neither is he the son of man that he
[1:28:31] should repent." God don't have to lie.
[1:28:34] God don't have to repent because he
[1:28:35] never makes mistakes. When God says,
[1:28:38] "I'm your healer." When God says
[1:28:41] that uh that that you that as many as
[1:28:45] received him received eternal life with
[1:28:47] God says, Amen. that the that the
[1:28:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost is for your
[1:28:51] children and your children's children
[1:28:53] and to as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:28:56] call or give grace to. Amen. These
[1:28:58] creates expectations within our hearts.
[1:29:01] We are in the last age. This is the
[1:29:04] rapturing time. We don't have too much
[1:29:06] time. And I want to tell no matter what
[1:29:09] you've got in your mind, what you
[1:29:11] desire, if you will have an attitude, an
[1:29:14] atmosphere, create an atmosphere of
[1:29:17] faith and will stand there before God
[1:29:19] and believe God, there is nothing that
[1:29:22] is
[1:29:23] impossible. Nothing is impossible. Can
[1:29:27] you say amen? You know what I want? I'm
[1:29:29] praying that God fills every one of our
[1:29:31] kids with a greater dose of the Holy
[1:29:34] Ghost than any of us have ever had. I'm
[1:29:36] praying that this last generation will
[1:29:38] be serpent bruisers. I'm praying that
[1:29:40] this last generation will be a
[1:29:43] generation full of power and anointing
[1:29:46] and authority. I pray this generation
[1:29:50] will pick up the battle and take us into
[1:29:52] the rapture.
[1:29:55] Hallelujah. That's the decree of God.
[1:29:59] God's done spoke it concerning you young
[1:30:02] people that there will be young men
[1:30:04] that'll sweep this message of the coming
[1:30:06] of the
[1:30:15] Lord. There's waves going on up here.
[1:30:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I'm just
[1:30:22] wanting to tell you that anointing that
[1:30:24] I've got on me is right there if you'll
[1:30:27] access it by faith. if you'll access it
[1:30:30] by faith. Grace is accessed by faith.
[1:30:34] Open the door of faith and let God come
[1:30:36] walking into your heart. Open the door
[1:30:38] of faith and let God show you who you
[1:30:40] are. Open your door. Oh, come on now.
[1:30:43] You are the bride. You are what God has
[1:30:45] ordained. You are the adopted son.
[1:30:47] You've been given the message role of
[1:30:50] the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:56] James 1:17, "Every good gift and every
[1:31:00] perfect gift is from above, and cometh
[1:31:02] down from the Father of lights, with
[1:31:05] whom there is no variableness, neither
[1:31:07] of shallow, of turning, of his own
[1:31:10] will." Of his own
[1:31:13] will. Someone punch him and said,
[1:31:15] "That's so good." Just punch your
[1:31:16] neighbor and say, "That's so good." of
[1:31:19] his own will begat he us or birthed us
[1:31:24] with the word of truth. Wouldn't you
[1:31:26] begging? Wouldn't you pleading? Wouldn't
[1:31:29] you saying God of his own will he begat
[1:31:34] you with the word of truth that you
[1:31:37] should be we should be the first fruits
[1:31:39] of his creatures. Isaiah 55 and8 not
[1:31:42] going to hold you too much longer. Amen.
[1:31:44] Have I have I made my 40 minutes there
[1:31:46] Luke? Amen. For my I said 40 minutes and
[1:31:49] I'm out. I'm coming in and I'm going
[1:31:50] out. Amen. My thoughts are not your
[1:31:52] thoughts, neither are your ways my ways.
[1:31:55] For as the heavens are higher than the
[1:31:57] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[1:32:00] ways. My thoughts than your thoughts.
[1:32:02] For as the rain cometh down, and the
[1:32:05] snow from heaven, and returnneeth not
[1:32:07] thither, but waterth the earth, and make
[1:32:09] and maketh
[1:32:11] it, bring forth
[1:32:14] bud and and and give seed to the sewer,
[1:32:17] and bread to the heater, so shall my
[1:32:19] word that be that goeth forth out of my
[1:32:23] mouth, it shall not return unto me void.
[1:32:27] It shall accomplish what I please, and
[1:32:29] it shall prosper in the thing wherein to
[1:32:32] I have sent it. You shall go out with
[1:32:34] joy. This is your time to be shouting.
[1:32:36] You shall go out with joy and be led
[1:32:39] forth with peace, and the mountains and
[1:32:41] the hills shall break forth before you
[1:32:43] into singing, and the trees of the field
[1:32:46] shall clap their hands. That's what God
[1:32:48] is declaring to his bride.
[1:32:54] My word's not coming to you void. I'm
[1:32:56] not sending it to you void. I'm not
[1:32:58] extending my grace void. My seed I've
[1:33:00] placed in your heart. I'm extending my
[1:33:02] grace. You have something in you that no
[1:33:06] one else can do. You can believe.
[1:33:12] You kids have something in you that
[1:33:15] other
[1:33:16] kids you can
[1:33:19] believe. You have you can receive the
[1:33:21] Holy Ghost.
[1:33:23] Others receiving the Holy Ghost, then it
[1:33:25] falls on their spirit, man. But you can
[1:33:27] receive the Holy Ghost all the way down
[1:33:29] to the
[1:33:30] soul, and it creates, oh yeah, it'll
[1:33:33] still make you act. It'll still make you
[1:33:35] speak in tongues like they speak in
[1:33:36] tonesues. It'll still make you prophesy
[1:33:38] like it makes them prophesy. It'll still
[1:33:40] It'll do all of those things.
[1:33:43] Hallelujah. But it's more than just a a
[1:33:46] few little gifts. It's the eternal life
[1:33:48] coming down and igniting the soul and
[1:33:51] making you a God man. Making you a God
[1:33:54] woman. Can you say amen? Amen. As I get
[1:33:57] ready to close now, without the promise
[1:34:00] there is no expectation. Somebody say,
[1:34:03] without the promise,
[1:34:06] there is no expectation.
[1:34:08] Without expectation,
[1:34:11] there is no preparation.
[1:34:18] Without the promise there is no
[1:34:20] expectation. Without expectation there
[1:34:23] is no
[1:34:28] preparation. Prayer doesn't mean
[1:34:31] much. Church doesn't mean much.
[1:34:35] But when you know that there's a promise
[1:34:37] of the Holy Ghost and when you know that
[1:34:38] God's prophets done told us that he has
[1:34:40] got a five-fold ministry that that is
[1:34:43] God's generals. Amen. And they are here
[1:34:47] with the anointing to preach the word
[1:34:51] unto you. Then you can come under a
[1:34:56] promise with an
[1:34:58] expectation and you can
[1:35:00] prepare. I don't care if it's a
[1:35:02] Wednesday night. I don't care if it's a
[1:35:04] Sunday night. I don't care. I don't care
[1:35:06] what what night it is. I don't care if
[1:35:07] it's a youth night. You can come to that
[1:35:09] meeting with an expectation and you can
[1:35:12] prepare. I I I I I told I you know I
[1:35:15] told the youth uh camp the uh you know
[1:35:20] of of Hannah, Amen, my my niece Hannah
[1:35:23] when she was a girl, Amen. want the
[1:35:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It just got
[1:35:26] so so much in her heart. She had to
[1:35:29] receive it. Amen. And she started
[1:35:31] fasting and praying the week before.
[1:35:33] Amen. She got there to camp. Amen. And
[1:35:36] she would come to those services and she
[1:35:38] would stay in that building all day
[1:35:41] long. Amen. And she was just in there
[1:35:44] praying. Amen. She would be the last one
[1:35:47] to leave at night, way at night. And
[1:35:48] it's because they were trying to get
[1:35:50] shut down the lights. Amen. She was
[1:35:52] there the first day, the second service,
[1:35:56] had six services. She's still not
[1:35:57] received it yet. Amen. And there she
[1:36:00] was. She's getting more desperate. more
[1:36:02] desperate, wanting the baptism of the
[1:36:04] Holy Ghost every time. Amen. We'd walk
[1:36:07] in. There she was. Shut peek in. There
[1:36:09] she was. There just calling out to God.
[1:36:12] I I'm preparing for it. Friends, you've
[1:36:13] got to prepare for it. You You But you
[1:36:15] got to expect. You're never going to
[1:36:16] prepare if you don't expect it. And
[1:36:18] you're not going to expect it. Amen. If
[1:36:20] you don't think the word is right, if
[1:36:22] God says your sons and daughters shall
[1:36:25] prophesy, and your old men shall dream
[1:36:27] dreams, your young men shall see
[1:36:29] visions. If you don't believe it, you're
[1:36:32] not going to prepare. But if you start
[1:36:35] expecting, if you start preparing, then
[1:36:38] God will give you an access into his
[1:36:41] grace.
[1:36:45] Can you say amen?
[1:36:49] She waited finally that last
[1:36:51] service, very last
[1:36:55] service, the glory of the Lord.
[1:36:59] All the other kids were all Sunday
[1:37:02] mornings a little hard for especially
[1:37:04] especially when you're at that sunrise
[1:37:06] service. You have to be there at church
[1:37:07] at 7 o'clock in the morning and you had
[1:37:10] you were in church you in that prayer
[1:37:11] line until 12:30 or 1. Amen. Those kids
[1:37:15] they were just ready to go home.
[1:37:18] Hallelujah.
[1:37:20] But
[1:37:22] she was
[1:37:25] anticipating. God, this is my
[1:37:27] last. I want to
[1:37:29] hear. I want to receive
[1:37:32] it. You know what happened? God filled
[1:37:35] her with the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:39] Ghost. Now, my sweet little Hannah is
[1:37:43] married to Amen. married to brother
[1:37:46] Zachary Wallace. Amen.
[1:37:50] the missionary evangelist. What was it?
[1:37:54] Oh, it was somebody holding God to his
[1:37:57] word. Somebody making preparation. Oh,
[1:38:00] come on now. If you want it, I don't
[1:38:02] remember what I done. I told you kids
[1:38:04] how I done it. I drove my mama so crazy.
[1:38:07] She'd come down and pray with me. I
[1:38:09] serious about it. She'd come down to the
[1:38:11] church and pray with me. She'd call up
[1:38:13] the women, some of the women at some of
[1:38:14] the prayer warriors. She'd get those
[1:38:16] faithful old ladies and they'd come
[1:38:18] around all praying with me. Amen. And I
[1:38:22] I I'd pray and pray. Amen. Oh, it took
[1:38:25] me oh my before I could just surrender
[1:38:28] and accept it. It was it it went it went
[1:38:30] for it went for two years, buddy. Amen.
[1:38:34] Before I could and and and and a lot of
[1:38:37] it was because there I still had my my
[1:38:40] Pentecostal ways. I I I I I I was
[1:38:43] expecting a certain feeling or I was
[1:38:44] expecting a certain thing. But I tell
[1:38:46] you what, God gave me that honor. God
[1:38:49] came down and honored my faith. He found
[1:38:51] he gave me something that I can look
[1:38:53] back on and say, "God touched me right
[1:38:54] there. God touched me right there. I
[1:38:57] have that experience." Aren't you glad
[1:38:59] that you kids can have that experience?
[1:39:00] God touched me. I remember when you were
[1:39:02] test when you came back and said, "God
[1:39:04] gave it." That's something that you can
[1:39:06] go back and say, "That was holy ground
[1:39:08] right there. That's when God come and
[1:39:09] touch me." Are y'all are y'all
[1:39:11] understanding? Amen. When that little
[1:39:12] something happens, why? It's a It's a
[1:39:15] It's the word that creates the
[1:39:17] expectation. It's the expectation that
[1:39:19] is creating
[1:39:24] preparation. Grace is
[1:39:27] there. The Lord let me want it more than
[1:39:30] I want anything of this world.
[1:39:36] Then the word becomes vision to
[1:39:41] you.
[1:39:42] Expectation. Well, bless the name of the
[1:39:45] Lord. Do you love him here
[1:39:50] tonight? An
[1:39:53] atmosphere. You know, an
[1:39:56] atmosphere brings
[1:39:59] results. We accept God's word right now.
[1:40:02] right now where you are where right now
[1:40:04] where you are. Accept God's word and
[1:40:06] release that faith. Swing that door wide
[1:40:09] open.
[1:40:11] Hallelujah. That door in
[1:40:14] heaven. This is a rapturing generation.
[1:40:17] Why can't we just go right on up into
[1:40:18] the heavenlies here
[1:40:22] today?
[1:40:24] Amen. God bless you. As the musicians
[1:40:27] would
[1:40:29] come. Hallelujah.
[1:40:32] We accept that
[1:40:35] word. We release all skepticism that's
[1:40:38] kicked out. All doubt squatchched. All
[1:40:40] sin put under the
[1:40:42] blood. Everything that needs to be
[1:40:45] repented of, we have repented
[1:40:51] of. We are sons of God. We are daughters
[1:40:54] of God.
[1:40:59] And you should have already made up in
[1:41:00] your mind that I am not those other two
[1:41:02] believers. I am the believer
[1:41:06] because there is something in me that is
[1:41:10] screaming for life.
[1:41:16] You're standing
[1:41:18] pure. You're standing
[1:41:21] virtuous. You're standing clean. You're
[1:41:24] standing faultless.
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:36] because grace has provided the
[1:41:41] garments. Grace has provided the
[1:41:44] garments. Now again, I'm not talking I
[1:41:47] don't I don't believe in sleazy grace. I
[1:41:50] don't believe in this sleazy
[1:41:53] grace. Well, you turn grace into
[1:41:55] disgrace. Well, it don't matter what I
[1:41:57] do. Then that's a good sign that you
[1:41:59] ain't got it.
[1:42:03] I'm talking about a son of God who's had
[1:42:05] to receive the new
[1:42:08] birth. When you fall, it
[1:42:11] hurts. And when you're not pleasing to
[1:42:14] God, it hurts. I'm not talking about
[1:42:16] because everyone knows about you. I'm
[1:42:17] talking about when no one else knows
[1:42:19] about it. It's just you and God and your
[1:42:22] heart is standing there weeping before
[1:42:25] God. Say, "God, I'm
[1:42:29] sorry. I ask that you help
[1:42:33] me. Give me that
[1:42:36] grace to rise again." And you try me one
[1:42:39] more
[1:42:41] time. All right.
[1:42:46] Brother Brandham would
[1:42:49] say talked about the man
[1:42:52] that walked in applying for a job and he
[1:42:56] had his pencil with
[1:42:57] him and he was doing the interview there
[1:43:02] and the he filled out the work
[1:43:04] and boss the employer was looking over
[1:43:08] his paper and asked him to come
[1:43:10] in sitting there with his pencil
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:15] I notice you got a pencil without an
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:20] eraser. He said, "Yes, sir. That's
[1:43:25] right." Why would you have a pencil
[1:43:27] without any
[1:43:29] eraser? He said, "Well, I don't make
[1:43:32] mistakes. I'm that thorough. You can
[1:43:34] hire me.
[1:43:37] I I get the job
[1:43:40] right the first time.
[1:43:44] God pushes his chair away from the table
[1:43:46] and says, "Well, that ends this
[1:43:50] interview. I don't want a guy that
[1:43:52] thinks that he's right all the
[1:43:55] time. I want a guy with an
[1:43:58] eraser. I want a guy that is able
[1:44:02] to
[1:44:04] admit, I missed the mark."
[1:44:09] And then God refers to
[1:44:12] us. You know what God's eraser
[1:44:16] is? He's got
[1:44:23] blood. It doesn't take away our
[1:44:26] expectation. It doesn't take away It
[1:44:29] doesn't take
[1:44:31] away who we are. It's just It just shows
[1:44:34] that we're mortal and that we're not the
[1:44:37] holy one.
[1:44:40] But as long as I can keep the Holy One
[1:44:43] with
[1:44:44] me. Someone asked him, "So, Brother
[1:44:46] Brandon, what what does that mean? Do
[1:44:50] you do you believe that I can lose the
[1:44:52] Holy
[1:44:55] Ghost?" He says, "I don't I don't
[1:44:57] believe that you can lose your
[1:44:59] salvation, but he says, but I will tell
[1:45:01] you, let me put it like this. The Holy
[1:45:04] Spirit is like a
[1:45:06] dove that rests upon your
[1:45:12] shoulder. As long as you've got a
[1:45:14] meekness about you and a sweetness about
[1:45:17] you, that Holy Spirit is right there
[1:45:20] with you.
[1:45:23] But
[1:45:25] whenever you get flustered or you get he
[1:45:29] said that that little dove will fly off
[1:45:32] into the tree over yonder. Now I wasn't
[1:45:36] there. This is tabletop stories on this
[1:45:40] that I'm fixing to tell
[1:45:43] you. Brother Ken might have heard it
[1:45:45] too. They said, "Well, Brother Brandham
[1:45:46] was telling the story, a dove come and
[1:45:49] landed on Brother Brandham's
[1:45:51] shoulder. And as he was telling the
[1:45:54] story,
[1:45:56] telling it went up there and landed upon
[1:45:59] a tree
[1:46:00] limb." And Brother Brandham said, "Now
[1:46:03] that's I've not found that in the in the
[1:46:05] in the tape."
[1:46:06] So now, I'm not saying that that's true.
[1:46:09] I'm just saying that that's what someone
[1:46:11] who was there said something about.
[1:46:12] Amen. I wasn't there. Amen.
[1:46:20] But brother Brandham was saying it's not
[1:46:22] that you
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:28] lose, it's that he's not
[1:46:31] there. He's not
[1:46:34] welcome. That's why That's why we
[1:46:37] repent. That's why we must repent.
[1:46:41] That's why we walk so
[1:46:44] softly. I don't care if I think that I'm
[1:46:48] the head honcho of the house. If I've
[1:46:50] said something that's wrong to my
[1:46:55] wife and I do it and I don't like doing
[1:46:59] it and I have to go tell her I'm wrong
[1:47:04] and I'm sorry for doing it.
[1:47:11] Why is that so important? Well, first of
[1:47:13] all, I love
[1:47:17] her. But most
[1:47:22] importantly, I don't want my
[1:47:26] attitudes or my
[1:47:28] words to displease
[1:47:32] him. That's the number one
[1:47:34] thing. But if I'm tearing down my wife,
[1:47:37] how How do you think that's going to be
[1:47:39] in her prayer
[1:47:41] time? If I'm telling her, "Well, how can
[1:47:43] you be a Christian and do this?" What
[1:47:46] What do you think she's going to have to
[1:47:47] fight when she's coming before the
[1:47:50] Lord? She's going to have to fight that
[1:47:52] cuz the devil's using my words, I'm her
[1:47:56] head. And in my fit of anger and I'm
[1:47:58] saying stuff to her that might be
[1:48:00] belittling to
[1:48:03] [Music]
[1:48:05] her that's causing a trial in her life.
[1:48:09] Well, God don't want me adding to her
[1:48:11] trial and God don't want me adding to
[1:48:13] your trial or you adding to
[1:48:16] mine. But we do
[1:48:21] fail. We do fail.
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:28] But we're quick. I don't want the dove
[1:48:32] leaving. I don't want that. I don't want
[1:48:34] that glory leaving
[1:48:38] me. Abide with
[1:48:40] me. But you know what he said? When you
[1:48:44] repent, he says, "The little dove comes
[1:48:46] right back down, settles upon
[1:48:49] you, and he brings peace with
[1:48:52] him. He brings that right
[1:48:56] down. Can you say
[1:49:00] amen? Do you love
[1:49:06] him? Grace has provided it all. Grace
[1:49:09] thought about it all. Mary, it thought
[1:49:10] about it
[1:49:12] all. Grace provided it all to that
[1:49:14] journey. That that journey from Egypt
[1:49:16] through the wilderness to the It thought
[1:49:18] Grace thought about it all. provided the
[1:49:20] lamp, provided the pillar of fire,
[1:49:22] provided the prophet, provided provided
[1:49:24] the the the brazen altar, provided the
[1:49:26] the the the rock. The rock followed him
[1:49:29] around for crying out loud. That was a
[1:49:31] supernatural rock. It was provided by
[1:49:38] God. And then to know, sister Karen,
[1:49:41] that brother Brandham says everything
[1:49:43] you need in this journey is laying
[1:49:46] within you. He said from from from this
[1:49:48] journey from here to glory to rapture is
[1:49:51] laying within you right
[1:49:56] now. Well, glory to God. What an
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:03] expectation. What a
[1:50:05] faith. Amen. What a faith. What what a
[1:50:10] love divine. What a what a what a
[1:50:13] blessing from God that he's given
[1:50:17] you
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:22] tonight. I choose to accept
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:27] it. If you ain't got that zeal in your
[1:50:30] heart, and I didn't get to I I sort of
[1:50:33] got sidetracked from all my message here
[1:50:35] tonight, but I think God preached what
[1:50:36] he wanted to preach. Hallelujah.
