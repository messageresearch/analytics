[40:16] the Lord blesses y'all when y'all uh go
[40:19] back to Arizona but Hebrews 11 And1 now
[40:23] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[40:25] for the evidence of things not seen for
[40:28] by it the elders obtained a good report
[40:31] through faith we understand that the
[40:34] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[40:36] the things which are seen were not made
[40:39] of things which do appear amen can we
[40:42] pray this evening dear gracious Heavenly
[40:44] Father oh Lord uh we thank you for this
[40:47] opportunity Lord to come into your house
[40:49] one more time lord maybe never take it
[40:52] for granted father that we have an open

[41:02] the service God we ask that you would
[41:04] move One More Time Lord as we felt your
[41:06] presence this morning Father we ask that
[41:08] you would move again speak to the hearts
[41:11] meet the needs father We Lay the service
[41:13] into your hands in Jesus name amen you
[41:16] may be seated this evening I'm just
[41:18] going to continue on my subject on
[41:21] stabilized by the Unseen um brother
[41:23] Brandon would say in look if men come
[41:25] out there just as an idol to look upon
[41:28] the serpent they received nothing but
[41:30] when the True Believer came out and
[41:32] looked upon the serpent with spiritual
[41:34] revealed truth that serpent the serpent
[41:37] itself being in the form of a serpent it
[41:40] represented sin already judged then they
[41:43] seen their sin their unbelief already
[41:45] under judgment from the serpent from the
[41:48] Garden of Eden as the serpent was made
[41:50] out of brass which means divine judgment
[41:53] see the altar was made out of brass the
[41:55] Brazen altar which the the sacrifice was
[41:58] off offered upon brass Divine judgment
[42:01] he says if you had come out and just
[42:03] looked at it just to look at it he says
[42:05] nothing would happen but the True
[42:07] Believer with a spiritual revealed truth
[42:10] would look upon it and would see in that
[42:13] brass serpent it was the atonement and
[42:16] the freedom of what was binding them the
[42:18] the the the the the snake bites I
[42:20] believe what what what what what the
[42:22] atonement was for at that time he would
[42:24] they would look at it and realize this
[42:26] is the thing that I'm needing to get my
[42:28] Deliverance they would have
[42:30] understanding and I believe that the
[42:32] True Believer hears more than just
[42:34] sermons we hear more than just just
[42:36] quotes and and scriptures but I believe
[42:39] when we hear this message we hear
[42:41] substance we hear something that is
[42:43] calling out to us and revealing to us
[42:46] that we've got a future and brother
[42:48] Brandon would say now listen real close
[42:50] to this remark Faith now don't forget
[42:52] this now Faith is designed to see what
[42:55] God wills and wants there was no
[42:58] knowledge that can do that faith alone
[43:00] is designed and give to the human race
[43:03] to find out what the will of God Is So
[43:06] faith in the word of God reveals and
[43:09] it's designed for you to see what the
[43:11] will of God is you know we don't just
[43:13] look at the we don't listen to tapes
[43:15] just out of Duty but I believe we can
[43:17] find the will of God for our our
[43:19] marriages we can find the will of God
[43:20] for our families we can find the will of
[43:23] God and by faith we can put that into
[43:26] action we see what God designs and what
[43:29] he wants in this generation and brother
[43:31] Brandon would tell us that Pharaoh would
[43:33] look out a window and would see the
[43:35] children of Israel and would say that
[43:37] they're just mud dobbers they're just
[43:39] slaves and brother Brandon would say
[43:41] that Moses would look out the same
[43:42] window and not see slaves but he seen
[43:45] Victory you see it was the faith of God
[43:48] in the word of God which would produce
[43:51] the will of God in their life and I
[43:53] believe that faith in the word of God
[43:55] would produce the promises in every one
[43:57] of our life you believe that you believe
[43:59] that this evening so when when Pharaoh
[44:02] was looking at slaves Moses was looking
[44:04] at Victory and I believe whenever
[44:06] everybody else looks at circumstances
[44:08] they look at sicknesses they look at the
[44:10] they look at uh things by natural eyes
[44:13] you see more than circumstances you see
[44:16] Victory you see more than the Valley of
[44:18] the shadow of death but you see that he
[44:20] is with me it's looking in the Unseen by
[44:23] faith and realizing that the Unseen is
[44:26] walking with us every step of the way
[44:29] and it's not that we're hoping to have
[44:30] it but the Brandon would tell us that
[44:32] hope is looking for something but faith
[44:35] has something faith is the evidence the
[44:37] substance of things hoped for so it's
[44:40] not that we're hoping to achieve Victory
[44:43] but faith has already achieved it for
[44:45] the brandom says now we reason with our
[44:47] mind but the heart doesn't reason the
[44:50] heart just believes we look with their
[44:52] eyes but we see with the heart do you
[44:54] look you you you take something
[44:56] complicated you see I I you say I don't
[44:58] just see it you mean you don't
[45:00] understand it understanding comes from
[45:02] the heart you have your understanding
[45:05] and so by understanding we know that
[45:08] Victory is right around the corner for
[45:10] us you know whenever you feel like uh
[45:12] you get dry in your get dry in your
[45:14] experience with God you don't hope for
[45:16] Revival you believe for Revival you
[45:19] start to press toward a Revival you lay
[45:22] you lay aside the weights that easily
[45:23] beset you you're working and you and
[45:26] you're working to achieve something with
[45:28] your faith you see brother brandom says
[45:30] hope looks for it but Faith achieves it
[45:33] brother brandom says now look he says uh
[45:35] hope looks for something way off but
[45:38] Faith claims it right now see faith says
[45:41] God said so in its mind that settles it
[45:44] sea I don't care if I'm still crippled
[45:47] if I'm still blind if I'm still sick
[45:49] that don't have nothing to do with it I
[45:52] believe it anyhow it's mine right now
[45:55] God said so and that SLE says see that's
[45:58] Faith but hope says God said so I'm
[46:01] expecting to get it someday you see I'm
[46:03] expecting someday and as long as Satan
[46:06] can put you off to another day that's as
[46:09] good as he wants and so hope is pushing
[46:12] off Revival for right for for another
[46:15] year for our next convention for a youth
[46:17] camp but faith says but faith says
[46:19] Revival is right now hope says healing
[46:22] is way off in the future but faith says
[46:24] it's right now he continues on to say
[46:26] that's right you'll never get it just
[46:28] believe that you got it right now it's
[46:30] your personal property and I love how he
[46:33] puts it it's your personal property you
[46:35] know if I come up to come up the dev and
[46:38] I took his tie it's not mine it's his
[46:40] tie and so now he has every right to
[46:43] come track me down hunt me down and take
[46:45] his tie back because it was his in the
[46:48] first place so he ain't coming and
[46:50] stealing it from me he's taking it back
[46:52] you see you can't steal Joy from the
[46:54] devil you're just returning it back to
[46:56] it's original owner but hope is pushing
[46:59] it off that you'll never get it you'll
[47:01] never get it you'll never see Revival
[47:03] you'll never see Deliverance in your
[47:05] family you'll never see uh Revival in
[47:07] your marriage you see but faith says no
[47:09] I'm not hoping for it I'm achieving it
[47:13] I'm grabbing a hold of it and bringing
[47:15] the Unseen into reality oh my that's
[47:19] what this message has done it has
[47:20] brought the Unseen into reality but the
[47:23] brandom continues on to say you know
[47:25] faith is the substance of things hope
[47:27] for the evidence of Things Not Seen is
[47:30] that right Faith acts now it's positive
[47:34] I love that Faith acts now it's positive
[47:37] it's not a negative thing you know
[47:39] brother Brandon would say it's like
[47:40] putting a an apple before the horse to
[47:42] get it to move he says it's not it's not
[47:45] a negative thing it's a positive thing
[47:47] that you can reach out and grab you're
[47:49] seeing but as long as Satan is putting
[47:52] it off for another day that's as good as
[47:54] he wants you to get but you see even if
[47:57] you don't see the results now you've got
[47:59] substance you've got something to grab a
[48:02] hold of you know brother Brandon would
[48:03] say that Peter didn't walk on water he
[48:06] walked on substance ain't that
[48:07] incredible he says and he stepped down
[48:10] and said it's the Lord I'll just walk
[48:12] but when he go when he got his eyes on
[48:14] the waves he got scared and what came
[48:17] what come in his mind the first thing
[48:19] I'm going to walk because the word said
[48:21] for me to walk the next thing he looked
[48:24] at well he looked at his symptoms he he
[48:26] looked up there and seen how big them
[48:28] waves was and he got scared and when he
[48:31] did he went down see what he feared
[48:34] happened what he believed happened and
[48:37] when he believed he could walk he walked
[48:39] when he believed and and and and later
[48:42] on in the quote he says substance would
[48:44] have walked right over top of that white
[48:46] cap it would have went right onto him
[48:49] ain't that incredible so he didn't walk
[48:51] upon the Water he walked upon substance
[48:54] until he started to fear fell
[48:57] and you see brother the brandom says
[48:58] what he feared would come upon him and
[49:01] that is something that the devil likes
[49:03] to throw upon Church Upon church members
[49:06] message Believers is the fear of failure
[49:08] and brother brandom says what you fear
[49:10] is going to come upon you and job would
[49:12] say what I feared has come upon me and
[49:16] so the devil wants to throw these things
[49:18] on you that you're never going to be
[49:19] good enough you're not going to make a
[49:21] Rapture and you start to believe those
[49:23] things and it pushes you in that
[49:26] direction and takes away the substance
[49:29] that this message has brought you but
[49:31] this ain't the time to throw away
[49:33] substance for fear it's time to throw
[49:35] away fear and grab a hold of substance
[49:38] and brother Brandon would say in the
[49:40] Book of Job it says here job feared and
[49:43] when he feared it it actually happened
[49:46] what brought it his fear that's what
[49:48] made it happen his faith would have kept
[49:51] him from it but his fear brought it to
[49:53] him his faith would have taken it away
[49:56] and kept him from it but his fear
[49:58] brought it on he was scared it was going
[50:01] to happen and it did happen now he know
[50:04] it wouldn't have happened it wouldn't
[50:05] have happened see what I mean and if
[50:07] you're afraid when you come by the
[50:09] prayer line maybe I just haven't got the
[50:11] faith sufficient it'll never happen that
[50:13] way see but if you know you're it's
[50:16] going to happen it'll happen see it's a
[50:19] substance of something and so Faith goes
[50:22] beyond fear hope is that hope is is
[50:26] combined with fear hope is is hoping I'm
[50:28] going to get it but there's that little
[50:30] chance I might not get it and brother
[50:32] brandom says if you're afraid that
[50:34] you're not going to get it don't worry
[50:37] you're not going to get it but if you
[50:39] actually believe he says there's a
[50:42] substance behind it and I believe every
[50:44] one of us is is wanting a Revival right
[50:47] wanting a renewing in our lives wanting
[50:49] a renewing in our in our families but
[50:51] we're not hoping for a Revival we're
[50:54] expecting a Revival right we're not
[50:56] hoping for an an outpouring of the Holy
[50:59] Ghost we're expecting the outpouring of
[51:02] the Holy Ghost but you see before we can
[51:04] ever see the supernatural we've got to
[51:07] expect the supernatural right you're
[51:09] never going to get up and get something
[51:11] if you don't want it in the first place
[51:13] right many want to see the results but
[51:16] they don't want to expect the results
[51:18] they don't want to put put the effort in
[51:20] in of entering in and pulling out a
[51:23] Revival for themselves you know it was
[51:26] Elijah that would say I see the I see
[51:28] the I hear the abundance of rain right
[51:31] and there was and you know and if you
[51:33] look up the scripture he he would say
[51:35] this before he seen The Cloud of a man's
[51:38] hand I always thought that he had seen
[51:41] the cloud then said I hear the sound of
[51:44] the abundance of rain has anybody else
[51:45] ever thought that I always thought he
[51:47] seen the cloud then said it but he said
[51:50] it first then seen the cloud so before
[51:53] he ever seen any in the result or or any
[51:57] any actions or or seen any evidence he
[52:00] was already preparing for the Revival
[52:03] and you notice what what why would start
[52:05] this revival into motion the Bible would
[52:08] tell us he would call a showdown upon
[52:10] Mount Carmel right and he would get a
[52:12] 450 priests together and at the end of
[52:15] it he would say if God be God then serve
[52:18] him if B be God then serve them but you
[52:21] see what would happen if during The
[52:24] Showdown 450 50 priests would be slain
[52:28] by the Israelites and so the very thing
[52:32] that would keep them from moving to the
[52:34] things of God once they would slay them
[52:37] the very next verse if you look there in
[52:40] First Kings 18 and 40 and Elijah said
[52:43] unto them take the prophets of baale let
[52:46] not one of them escape and they took
[52:48] them and Elijah brought them down to the
[52:50] brick Kon and slew them there and Elijah
[52:53] said unto Ahab get thee up and drink for
[52:56] there is the sound of abundance of rain
[52:59] so as soon as the the the all of the the
[53:02] priest of bell was slain then the
[53:05] Revival would start to move into action
[53:08] oh and I think if there's ever a time to
[53:10] get rid of sin in our lives let's slay
[53:13] every priest of bail let's slay every
[53:15] emotion that will try to hinder us from
[53:18] the things of God so that we can see the
[53:21] abundance of rain oh Hallelujah he would
[53:24] he would say I hear it and but Brandon
[53:26] would say when we find Elijah kept
[53:29] looking until he seen just the size of a
[53:31] man's hand no unbelief would have caught
[53:34] that real quick is that the best that
[53:36] you can do see if that's all you can do
[53:38] we'll take it back but what was it he
[53:40] was looking for the supernatural oh he
[53:43] knew that only the hand of God could do
[53:46] it and when he saw that hand j s u s he
[53:50] had F I F AI t h yes when he saw it he
[53:54] said I hear the sound of the abundance
[53:56] of rain what wasn't he accepted the
[53:59] first move but you notice brother
[54:01] brandom says he was looking for the
[54:03] Supernatural and he only knew he would
[54:06] come by the hand of God ain't that
[54:08] incredible so a man is not going to
[54:10] bring the supernatural only the hand of
[54:13] God can bring the Supernatural and so if
[54:16] we get our eyes upon the hand of God and
[54:19] say Lord whatever you bring from behind
[54:21] the pulpit I accept it it may hurt but I
[54:24] accept it I'm wanting to get rid of all
[54:27] of the hindrances so that I can see the
[54:30] move of God and you know that we had a
[54:32] prophet in this generation that would
[54:34] call for a showdown he would he would
[54:36] line up all of and I love how brother
[54:37] Brandon he the confidence that he would
[54:40] have I believe there was a blind man
[54:42] that would worship the son and he would
[54:44] call them all out and say if your God is
[54:46] able to open his eyes come up and do it
[54:49] if your God is able to open up his eyes
[54:51] come up and do it he was calling a
[54:53] showdown letting the Believers in the
[54:55] congre ation no if you think that is God
[54:59] have him produce the results but if I
[55:01] God is the truth it will produce the
[55:04] results we know what would happen that
[55:06] his eyes would come open it was a
[55:08] showdown letting you know that there's a
[55:11] Revival for the bride and Miracle has
[55:14] missed it's it's Revival but the bride
[55:16] has got a word Revival in this
[55:19] generation that you can experience day
[55:21] in and day out on the good days you can
[55:24] live in Revival on the bad days you can
[55:26] live in Revival we see we didn't just
[55:28] get an Elijah in this generation with
[55:31] with to bring a showdown but we also got
[55:34] our own cloud right we didn't just get a
[55:37] a cloud of a man's hand but we got a
[55:39] cloud of God's face his head letting you
[55:42] know that I'm returning to the body to
[55:45] bring forth the results so it ain't us
[55:48] trying to produce the Revival he brought
[55:51] the Revival and what would brother
[55:52] brandom say he says that's the Lord up
[55:55] there oh it it wasn't a man's idea it
[55:58] wasn't some intellectualness coming down
[56:00] it was our Lord coming down with an open
[56:03] book the bright Revival letting you know
[56:06] I hear the sound of the abundance of
[56:09] rain and brother Brandon would say I
[56:11] hear the sound of abundance of healing
[56:14] so whatever you have need of I hear the
[56:17] sound if you can just get rid of all of
[56:19] the doubts all the skeptic feelings if
[56:22] you can get get rid of all of the
[56:24] priests of baale then you can see that
[56:27] there's abundance waiting for you and I
[56:30] like how Elijah would put it I he didn't
[56:32] say I hear the sound of rain I hear the
[56:35] sound of abundance of rain and not just
[56:37] a little Trinkle but it's going to
[56:39] overflow all of your ponds it's going to
[56:42] overflow all of your streams and I
[56:44] believe the blessings of
[56:46] God it's not just a little bit but
[56:49] there's a there's enough to pour out
[56:51] upon our lives and it overflow pour out
[56:54] upon our marriages and it overflow it's
[56:56] abundant not just a little bit but
[56:59] abundant brother the Brandon would say
[57:01] this here how do you know what the truth
[57:03] said the devil I know it's the truth
[57:06] it's God's word it's the truth something
[57:09] begins to pulsate in your bosom that it
[57:12] is the truth then make ready you're
[57:14] coming out of there just as certain as I
[57:18] stand in this pull pit tonight don't
[57:20] look at what you see how bad I'm
[57:22] crippled how sick I am what the doctor
[57:25] said don't look at that look at the
[57:27] Unseen what God said before you feel any
[57:31] different before the pain leaves before
[57:33] the hand moves before the eye can can
[57:36] can see one sight you make ready for
[57:39] it's going to come oh he says before you
[57:42] see any evidence of it you make ready
[57:45] because it is going to come and he would
[57:47] point there to the to the people in the
[57:49] wheelchairs it says you get ready you're
[57:52] coming out of it oh you may feel like
[57:54] you're in a slump this evening but get
[57:56] ready you're coming out of it you may
[57:58] say you don't understand I'm in a
[58:00] drought that is worse than than Israel
[58:02] don't worry I hear the sound if you're
[58:05] getting rid of all of the unbelief in
[58:07] your life I hear the sound of the
[58:09] abundance of rain don't worry you're
[58:12] coming out of it oh Hallelujah and you
[58:15] see that's just not some empty words of
[58:17] a man trying to prophesy he was letting
[58:20] you know if you truly believe it then
[58:22] start making preparations dig the
[58:25] ditches so to speak speak if you truly
[58:27] expect it to happen then act upon it oh
[58:31] but Elijah was looking for the
[58:33] Supernatural and I believe that we can
[58:35] look for it and see it you know I read
[58:37] this quote this morning but before Jesus
[58:40] ever rode into the city they were making
[58:42] ready for him to come but the Bram says
[58:44] now watch now here now here BEC comes
[58:47] riding unto the city just exactly what
[58:49] the word said he would do riding uh
[58:52] riding on a little donkey coming into
[58:54] the city these were not looking at the
[58:57] Creed not looking at the temple not
[58:59] looking at these other things not
[59:01] looking up the priest or what they had
[59:03] to say those that believed him were
[59:06] standing there with with palm in their
[59:08] hand just waiting for the first move you
[59:11] never heard them say who's coming oh no
[59:13] they knew who was coming they knew what
[59:16] the word said you see but then brother
[59:18] brandom says there was another group
[59:20] that would hear the commotion would come
[59:22] out and say who is this and brother
[59:23] Brandon would tell us they wasn't
[59:25] expecting in him to come so when he came
[59:28] they didn't know who it was and I think
[59:30] it's so incredible cuz brother brandham
[59:32] says why was they in the city in the
[59:35] first place was because God had told
[59:38] them to do a feast remember that and
[59:40] brother Brandon would say the very one
[59:42] that told them to do the feast was now
[59:45] riding in the city but they failed to
[59:47] see him and and and and I and brother
[59:50] Brandon would tell us that what Jesus
[59:52] was there upon the cross they were there
[59:54] singing songs you know they pierced my
[59:56] side you know and brother Brandon says
[59:58] it was happening right in front of them
[1:00:01] but they could not see it their
[1:00:03] expectation of how it was going to
[1:00:05] happen did not match the way God was
[1:00:08] coming to to to uh to express itself and
[1:00:12] don't don't let us get an expectation
[1:00:14] that God is going to move a certain way
[1:00:17] and when God starts to move we miss our
[1:00:20] Revival right we miss our visitation we
[1:00:23] miss the way God is talking to us
[1:00:26] because you're never going to get a
[1:00:28] Revival unless you expect a Revival
[1:00:30] right and you're not going to expect a
[1:00:32] Revival unless you know you need a
[1:00:34] Revival right and so brother brandom
[1:00:36] says those who were looking for him did
[1:00:39] not say who is this they recognized him
[1:00:43] and they started to act upon who they
[1:00:45] seen and brother Brandon would say this
[1:00:47] watch Elijah when he accepted it you
[1:00:50] know his life must have been renewed he
[1:00:53] outran ahab's chariots he ran before the
[1:00:56] Chariot when he could hardly climb the
[1:00:58] hill he ran before the Swift horses get
[1:01:01] the rain barrels out I hear the sound of
[1:01:04] abundance of rain the first move Glory
[1:01:07] as soon as he accepted him it hadn't
[1:01:10] even rained yet he didn't see one drop
[1:01:13] but him accepting it would bring such a
[1:01:16] Revival that he would outrun the king's
[1:01:18] chariots and let me say this you you
[1:01:21] accept the word the bride's Revival and
[1:01:24] watch a new Strength come on the inside
[1:01:27] and you can out run every unbelieving
[1:01:29] Spirit you can out run every skeptical
[1:01:32] spirit that tries to come against you
[1:01:35] it's not you seeing the results it's you
[1:01:37] accepting it which brings the results oh
[1:01:41] Hallelujah brother Brandon says he could
[1:01:43] barely walk up the hill before but once
[1:01:46] he accepted it then he could outrun the
[1:01:48] Chariots oh not when he seen the
[1:01:51] manifestation but when he accepted he
[1:01:53] accepted the substance of it and then
[1:01:56] that would bring on a renewing oh
[1:01:59] Hallelujah and Elijah he wasn't looking
[1:02:01] for flashy things right he would hear
[1:02:03] the thunder he would see the lightning
[1:02:05] he would feel the earthquake but he knew
[1:02:07] that he wasn't looking for any of those
[1:02:09] things but give me something true give
[1:02:11] me something person
