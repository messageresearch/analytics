privilege to be here and good to see all of our friends and uh just everyone that has come to the house of the lord and come to these meetings and we sure appreciate brother wendell and the church here and just so dear and precious to our hearts and and uh we you know the the older i get the the more i realized that brother wendell and the church had to put up with a lot with me and uh you know you you you grow a little bit and you think oh my i was just a bad bad kid uh but uh we appreciate brother wendell's patience and his love and and uh just been a great godly example in my life and and uh someone that i can look to and aspire to to be as a pastor and and uh so we just appreciate him more than just a big brother but he was always that but uh just on just a real example in my life as well and we just love the pawnee church here and so it's a good so good to be here and my what can we say about the word thus far i i i have been blessed truly truly blessed and uh we appreciate uh brother ronnie and by the manual and just these these soldiers of the cross these men who are just going to be ministering the word and got so much great confidence and respect for them and i know that uh we're going to leave here changed better christians and uh with a greater faith and confidence in the word that's the kind of meetings i love when you leave you've got a greater faith and a greater confidence in god and not confusion or anything but just a real it's just a real solid word to anchor the hearts of the people and i i tell you i i'm glad to be identified with these these men and just all these these soldiers of the cross with you the believer amen and so if you have your bibles saint john the first chapter and we've got to link the scripture reading we'd like to just begin at the first verse and we'll go down to the 16th verse and then john the third chapter and then we'll turn to luke the 17th chapter i just like to say also that we just so appreciate all of the the labor and to put a meeting like this on and there's there's a lot of labor and a lot of things behind the scenes we appreciate all the meals and you sisters just laboring there in the kitchen and all the work that goes into that and it's just been tremendous and so saint john the first chapter beginning with verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light thou was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god i'd like to read that again but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not a blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have all we received and grace for grace aren't you glad that we have received his fullness john the third chapter verse 28 to verse verses 31 ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must decree or he must increase but i must decrease now let us just go ahead and turn to luke the 17th chapter and i know all of these are familiar portions of scripture to us i'm sure but luke 17 beginning at verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father truly we deem it a great privilege to be here on this friday night and staying there in still water and just a lot of talk about game day and what's going to be taking place those that are coming in for a big day of festivities tomorrow lord but it's so good lord that you have put a real eternal joy within our hearts that we can come and rejoice around the word of god and something that is not just a temporal weekend satisfaction but an eternal joy lord i pray god that you would move us aside and help us to say something that'll just touch your people lord we would ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen god bless you as you would take your seats i i would like to uh borrow a title from our prophet and i and that is just one word and that is look i'd like to speak on look and i i i found that john 1 1 to me john 1 1 and then of course hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever are cornerstone scriptures of the entire bible and we see that god is his word and and he's never changed he he's not changing it his nature his ways his methods his pattern he is the word and he always will be the word and then we see that we read in the 14th verse that then we beheld his glory and it was the word when the word is made manifest then you can behold him you can see him and that doesn't need any interpretation it doesn't need anyone to look look back and and try to interpret what is going on but it is simply being interpreted before you and we just receive what god is doing amen and and i i i we see in the bible that god is the i am god and i am the promised word and when we see the promised word made manifest for the hour then you are looking at jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now the prophet of god would tell us in the anointed ones at the end time that the teaching of the season brings fruit for the season you see john the 15th chapter jesus is saying that god is looking for fruit amen he's looking for a bride tree that is manifesting the word the word fruit we see in the restoration of the bride tree that there is predestinated fruit that has been laying in the word for a predestinated season and the fruit is going to be the faith to lay hold of the promises that that there could be a manifestation of the power of god in the bride of jesus christ now that's what god is looking for he's not looking for just children he's not looking for pentecostal babies but he's looking for a woman a bride that has been maturing in this evening-like message amen not not trying to figure out if it's still right or not and not trying to figure out if we can put our confidence in it but we are a mature bride amen and they're a fruit that is there's a word concerning this bride that is being manifested in this hour hallelujah now you see the message has brought christ into focus amen how many can say man to that amen you see if someone tells you to look then what they're trying to do is they're trying to to to there's something specific that they're trying to get you to look at it's something they're trying to get you to see and they're trying to get your attention now the prophet of god told us what what what he's trying to get us to look at and the attraction on the mountain is god is fulfilling his word hallelujah that's what that's what the message is trying to do is get us to look at the word that is being fulfilled in this day and say there is christ we don't have to look there we don't have to look there we don't have to look there but there is a word concerning this bride in the evening time that is manifesting the fruit of a prophetic word hallelujah you see what's the attraction it is god fulfilling his word then you see there's power in what you look at now we find this in the exodus amen when there was sin that came into the camp of israel then for the cure of sin the prophet was to take a brazen serpent and put it up on a brass pole and put it before the congregation of israel and anyone that can look would live so there's power in what you're looking at we find that when jesus christ was lifted between the heaven and earth he was not just put there for a show but it was for a people that they could look and it would be a cure for sin this power in what you look at well you see in this exodus we are not looking at his corporate body because that's not the promise but the promise is the revealing of the word and when that word is made manifest you can look and you can live there's power in what you look at let me go ahead and just say it this way there's an atonic power in the world there's a blood in the word there is a bleach in the word there's a power to heal a power to deliver a power to set the captive free it is found in the word you see today we're looking to his word his word that's been revealed and vindicated and made a reality before us you see the prophet was saying the seed is not aired with the shock but at the opening of the seven seals revelations 10 the forward is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of god in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when he was here on earth amen hebrews 13 8 said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever luke 17 30 in the last days as it was in the days of sodom when the son of man will be revealing himself again it'll be the same thing the world is in a solemn condition and the church has went into sodom with it like lot and his wife and i say that there is an elected church somewhere in this world that's pulling out and set aside from those things and the manifestation of god has attracted its attention were at the last days the shock has given forth his strength into the seed what is the seed it's the seed word what has attracted our attention it's the word the promised word for this hour made manifest oh friends in that promised word is our messiah it's the anointing to break the yolks it is the revealing of the son of man the word made manifest and it's caught our attention it's a reality of his power [Applause] now there is so much to look at today the devil has placed every gimmick he has placed all confusion he is trying to his best to take away the attraction from the word we find in luke 21 2 21 25 and there shall be signs of the son and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken so the people are looking at so much confusion they're looking at so much fearful happenings there's so many things amen to bring fear upon the hearts of the people but that's not where it stops he says and then they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory let me just stop there and say that was not just some event that happened to heaven look and you'll see your redemption look and you'll see the power of his resurrection look and you will see your deliverance and a clown with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass look up [Applause] lift up your hands for your redemption draweth nigh we've got something to look at it's not a weak hybrid gospel it's the power of his resurrection that are changing lives it's a it's a revival that is restoring us back to the very mind of christ where there is no bad belief there is no fear to shackle you there's no sickness that can discourage you we are under the power of the headship of the son of man it's the word that's calling you come up higher come up higher come out of that confusion come out of the doom and gloom come out of all of the bellyaching and the grumbling and where's god after i say look i say look quit looking at the unbelief quit looking at the fear quit looking at satan's lies look and live [Applause] you see looking and redemption are simultaneous it's happening at the same time you can't separate the two look up your redemption draws now let me just say it like this your redemption's here the power to change your body is here [Applause] the power to change your nature is here you see god's given us something to look at we are looking at the revelation of jesus christ that's the promise of this hour the same ministry of jesus christ is made manifest in this day brother branham preached sermons like look look away to jesus looking unto jesus and he would ask those questions of what are you looking at what do you see when you look what are you looking for you would say what do you see when you do look that only depends on what you're looking for so let me ask you this what are you looking for [Applause] for jesus said who do you say i the son of man am i who are you looking for there it is you see let some say this some say that we got a lot of that still today the prophet would ask what are we coming to church for yeah i'll ask you this why do you why do you believe the message i'll ask you this who is the message [Applause] well you see it all depends what you're looking for you see some are looking just to see a good man and so they see a good man some are looking to see a teacher some are looking just to see a prophet some are looking to see a theologian what what are we looking for you see when man messes with the lens i've already told you the message has brought christ into focus we're not we're not looking to interpret anything we're looking to get all our belief out of our hearts and we're looking to keep christ the center of our focus [Applause] when man messes with the lens we always end up seeing a little lesser jesus we get a lutheran jesus we get a baptist jesus a methodist jesus a pentecostal jesus you see when men begin to put their own conception of jesus to this message it changes the whole focus then they begin to look for a psychologist they're looking for a modern day counselor to help cure the problems then they begin to maybe look for some modern day drug to numb their woes so they can get through lay out a seal [Music] you see when men begin to put their own conception of jesus to this message 100 of the time it lowers expectation for the supernatural people become disappointed they become discouraged they become offended what do you call that googly juice or whatever spray the goody-goody juice they become they become offended over everything they're looking for a substitute you know why they're looking for a substitute because the message can't do it any longer so they think that's good [Applause] but you see one time john the prophet he got into prison and his eagle eye got dimmed over and he had to he had to go and send some some messengers to go ask jesus are you the messiah or do we seek another and jesus didn't send john a little book to you know how to behave himself in prison but he just began to tell him of the word made manifest and he said don't tell john the blind seat the death here the dead are raised is not this the messiah only christ can do this only christ can take a drug addict and make them whole only christ can take a harlot and make them whole only christ can heal marriages only christ can set your heart in rapturing faith rapturing favor that there's no doubt no hindrance if he comes tonight you're ready hallelujah but jesus didn't say blessed are they who are not offended at me there's going to be some that are offended at the word and we're in that age there's so many people that just get so offended at the word hallelujah but you see the prophet of god would say he's done come through justification lutheran sanctification wesleyans pentecostal age done placed his gifts into the church and now appear to us in our flesh as jesus said he would don't be offended at him he's right on time john get out of that jail i just want to say we need to get out of the jail sometimes we get so locked up in our traditions we get so locked up in how the working the moving of the holy ghost supposed to be we get so locked up in how we think things ought to be we need to get out of the jail we need to give the headship to christ we need to allow the holy ghost to have preeminence in our life get out of the jail get out of the moly crops get out of the depression get out of the woe is me get away from what you can see with this natural eye and look to the reveal word it's a promise of revival it's a promise of victory it's a promise of joy it's a promise of revival not an intellectual revival it's a word revival [Music] you know what that means don't you [Applause] in your mind the devil's telling you you're in your mind that everything's falling apart and you're still in revival your mind the devil's telling you you ought to be depressed but you're still in revival the devil's painting a bad picture of the of the world today but the word but you're still in revival this is not an intellectual revival it's a revealed word revival it's something that god has placed within your heart you're bearing fruit unto the teaching of the season and the teaching of this message is you never sinned in the first place you are a gene seed of god's thoughts you've never had a beginning of end and you'll never have an ending you are the word made manifest satan you've lost control we are under the headship of the anointed revealed word of the hour get out of that jail why are we staying there [Applause] did we not hear a prophet say house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ has not the bars already already been broken asunder get out of the jail you see so many people they don't recognize him because he doesn't come according to their traditions jesus when jesus come those scribes and so forth ought to have recognized him but they didn't because they were set in their traditions oh the prophet again says another time they formed their own opinions of what he ought to be their own idea instead of taking what the word said that's why we've got so many people saying he's just a psychologist he's just a good counselor he's just a good man hallelujah amen their own idea instead of taking what the word said that's the way when they look eve and even see jesus himself they fail to recognize him they did it on the day of pentecost they did it when he was in flesh they did it when he was in the manger they did it when he was on the streets of jerusalem they did it when he was on the cross and he's the fulfillment of that word and yet they had the messiah coming down on a corridor out of heaven and everything else and was wrong because it was their intellectual conception and they failed to see him and looking right at him at him so it is today [Applause] again the prophet would ask in the sermon this day this scripture is fulfilled he says it depends how you approach it depends on what you're looking for when you go to church it depends on what you're looking for hallelujah i hope i'm not reading too much the prophet says these men why was they called and was put in this condition these pharisees by jesus jesus said in the vain you worship me worship him genuine worship true worship from their hearts in vain you worship me why teaching for doctrine their tradition of man therefore you make the commandment of god of no effect to the people if i taught you a methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bride time if moses taught the message of noah it would take no effect if jesus taught moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water let's give for that seed let me just say this this is harvest hot this is the evening harvest rain this is the anointing to ripen your your heart your faith to a perfect rapturing faith this is not a luther anointing this is not a wesley anointing and this is not a pentecostal anointing this is a bridegroom anointing this is our mate the revealed word that is revealing himself and whispering love secrets to your heart it's an anointing that comes from the headship of the messiah himself that i [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i think again we're looking for a fat yeah we're looking for we're looking for a manifestation so the prophet of god would say the question is what do you look what do you see when you look you see isaiah 45 and 22 says look unto me and be ye saved all things of the earth for i am god and there is none else the prophet would say look unto me all the ends of the earth now when the earth has come to its end or the system of the earth has come to its end let the people look unto him again the prophet would say look especially unto me at the end of each world system because he always makes himself known so real at the end of a world system is he god's into profit to tell us luck that means he's wanting us he's trying to get our focus on the promised word of the hour get our get our attention on the scriptural promises for the end time look on this and you won't miss the day of your visitation look at this malachi 4 luke 17 revelations 5 revelations 10 look upon these promises and you will not miss your day and hour of visitation you see he's made known by the promised word made manifest and his promise for this hour is the revealing of the son of man as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the revealing of the son of man the prophet of god said and when it come to the end of that world system when judgment was falling upon sodom amen it was when elohim stepped down upon the earth and he took 16 elements of dirt and he and he blew and there was a body and he stepped into that body and he come to abraham and he began to discern a sheriff's heart in the temp behind him what was he doing the prophet said that he was representing something that he would be in the last days it would be elohim the son of man it would be melchizedek the son of man it would be jesus christ the son of man it would be the bridegroom the son of man it would be the word made manifest the son of man it will be everything our healer the son of man deliver the son of man rapturing faith the son of man it would be grace grace to the bride when the word is made manifest well brother jonathan but you know the pentecostals watch it the prophet said you're looking a shock well but i think those denominations watch it because the life has already moved on and every one of those systems are dead shock dead tassel so the prophet had to catch the attention of the bride and call her out that she can receive messiah [Applause] we're looking at that quit looking at that quit looking at that quit looking at that you've got to look at this anointed word for this hour the reason that some people can't be delivered they're looking at the wrong thing so many people are trying to get the holy ghost and you can't get it you're looking at the wrong thing so many people are trying to live in overcoming life but you're in defeat you're looking at the wrong thing you see you're gonna come out come out of the jail come out of the system come out of the grave come out of the doom and gloom come out we're a revival this is the anointed world that breaks the yolks we're arguing with this message we're fussing with this message it's the anointing to break the oaks [Music] you see he had to represent something he was going to be in the last days so he comes right down and talks in human flesh amen oh i'm so glad that he's that kind now you get the point because the prophet of god just goes ahead and says it many many times and he says that again in the trial and he's talking to that blind prosecutor and that blind prosecutor that's trying to blind the eyes of the people to say that god don't do those things any longer the days of miracles are in the past god really don't love you and god really don't feel with the holy ghost and god really don't provide eternal joy and eternal peace and and eternal rest oh but when the prophet how he's going to nail his case he's going to deal with that blind prosecutor who is the devil himself and says satan god never promised nail scars he never promised prince and thorns he promised luke 17 30 the revealing of the son of man and it will be as in the days of abraham the days of lot when elohim came to the earth and he brought forth the power to bring forth life in their womb and change their bodies let me tell you something god's here to deal with the deadness of your heart god's here to deal with you according to life and there is no life outside of this word and you cannot be made pregnant outside of this word and you cannot bring forth predestinated proof outside of a predestinative message [Applause] elohim amen elohim the one the one that you need he didn't need you he's the self-existing one well god just needs me he don't need you you need him he's your husband and i don't care what this modern satanic spirit says a woman cannot bring forth seed outside of a mate it took a profit to reveal the revealed word and say now there's your mate if you're gonna find life you're gonna find it in the reveal word if you're going to find anything to do with rapturing grace it's going to be found in the revealed word that is your mate that's where the dynamics come from the lord himself shall descent [Applause] amen glory hallelujah is this all right amen see the prophet of god and i know we know this but i just got to read it i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it's the manifestation of the son of man the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man [Applause] can you imagine when john came to revelations 10 and john's a type of the bride and john was able to say i saw another mighty angel after coming through revelations nine when the lid of hell is lifted off and death angels are going forth and he's seeing nothing but death and destruction but then i saw another mighty angel when you see these things coming upon the earth and everyone is in fear and everyone is under the spirit of judgment and judgment is coming upon the world because they have rejected their messiah i'm not talking about 2 000 years ago i'm talking about this age they have rejected their messiah the prophet of god said we have our messiah the anointed word he's just looking for someone to anoint him with faith to make it live [Applause] they rejected their messiah when they rejected this message they rejected their bridegroom that could bring life within their womb to manifest predestinated fruit and they have just went into total chaos [Applause] but then revelations 10 the bride saw another angel and this wasn't just any angel this was a mighty angel oh this is a mighty angel and he's got a book in his hand and this is not a this is not a seven seal book this is not a book that's been that's been sealed up for the foundation of the world but this is a book of redemption that has been opened it has released the desires of the bride you know what the desires of the pride is to manifest christ to be pregnant what's the desire of any of any woman she wants to be pregnant she wants to manifest life so that seven sealed mystery of redemption had to be opened in the last days and the bride had to look and say wait a minute there's another angel this is not a death angel this is a messenger of life this is the body angel that's descending it's christ only christ can it be amen the prophet of god said christ is the anointed one john 1 1 says he's the word it's the anointed word [Music] this message ain't some dead letter this message is the dynamics i'm getting ahead of myself but that's okay this is the dynamics that has come to the mechanics to make this word live amen you don't have to just be sitting around a table mamas and daddies and and reading the bible and reading the message and saying my aren't those wonderful promises and too bad we can't live that today too bad god don't do those things today no sir there is a perfect faith within this bride when she reads of her promises she's looking at them with the spirit of joshua and caleb who were of another spirit and they said give me my mountain give me my point of redemption my name is written all over those promises christ has come to anoint my life to take my promises i'm anointed to possess the gates of my enemy i'm anointed to tear down cancer i'm anointed to tear down every disease i'm anointed i'm a knight to deliver overcoming life i'm anointed to challenge every spirit i'm anointed to say devil get out of my home you have no place in my life no place in my home no place in my car no place on my stereo no place on my computer get out of my home the mighty angel the anointed word has anointed you to take your position in christ [Applause] [Music] only christ can be and the prophet of god said revelations 10 1 was on the earth at the same time of revelations [Music] so when the prophet was trying to get us to see it's not me i'm trying to point you to him he's the one that tells things that are so perfectly he's the one that is that has placed thus saith the lord in the bride he's the one that said follow me as i follow christ he's the one that we are taking this anointing message and prophesying again we're prophesying over our families we'll come on somebody we're prophesying and saying they're coming no weapon formed against me shall prosper death you have lost your sting grave where is your victory i am holding up the vindicated anointed message of the hour satan you have no place in me i come out of the jail i've come out of the confusion i've come out of the defeat i've come out of the doom i've come out of darkness i have ripened i am here i am anointed manifested word for this day don't tell me i don't have a right don't tell me i'm coming in the future i'm here bring it on devil [Applause] too late devil you can't hold back of gene seed of god [Applause] he is the opening of the word amen you see paul said the lord is thy spirit all right and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty what was paul talking about he was talking about tremendous administration of condemnation right that was being spoken under the law of tops and shadows that was only prophesying of a perfect one to come and moses had to put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not look and see that which was to be abolished but when the messiah come and said this day this scripture is fulfilled there is a change at the ends at the ends of the world system when christ come to turn the corner that we heard about it was a change of dispensations of types and shadows to the perfect one standing before them saying the spirit of the lord hath anointed me this day this scripture is fulfilled and paul is saying that ministration of condemnation is done away with [Applause] but there's a veil that's still over their heart when they read the law they cannot see that which was to be done away with they can't read and see christ i'm going to stop here for a second because some of you say why do we need this kind of a preaching why do we why do we have to labor in these things it's because you're the only one that is blessed to see the word and see christ there's a veil that is still over their hearts and they're reading the same bible that you're reading and they've got a hundred or a thousand different jesus you see paul was saying now if the heart will ever turn to the lord the veil will be lifted and the lord is thy spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there's an anointing to lift the veil of darkness off of your heart that you can see into the perfect law of liberty and be changed from glory to glory brother jonathan i i those things are just so deep watch it as you're looking not into something that is deep and so well it's just beyond me no the prophet of god said is simple and as you are looking into god hiding himself in simplicity and revealed in the same way as you're looking at it you are being changed from glory to glory there's a power there is a liberty to be changed to be transformed not to be reformed be transformed [Music] not to just have a little pat on the hand and say now you know better than that not to just put you into the prison and say well let's reform him hopefully he'll be changed luther tried it and it never worked wesley tried it it never worked the pentecostal age tried it it never worked this is not a reformer's message this is christ himself the lord himself this is the liberty that the bride has been waiting for if you can see him you have the liberty to be changed you don't have to be the same you don't have to be bound you can be filled with the holy ghost you can be rejuvenated you can be changed by the power of the gospel you see we got to come to a mount transfiguration you see john john was there crying there he is look look lord he spent his whole message look there he is quit looking there quit looking there quit looking there look all right and when the disciples went up to jesus up with jesus to mount transfiguration and they've seen they've seen uh uh they see moses and they've seen elijah and then oh they got peter got so beside himself that he said let's make three tabernacles one to moses and one to elijah and one unto you jesus and then there's a cloud i'm not scared of clouds if you're wanting christ to be revealed we're not scared of clouds if you're wanting your thinking to be changed we're not scared of clouds but praise the name of the lord and when that cloud came down there is a voice that said this is my beloved son hear ye him [Applause] and when the cloud lifted they saw jesus and jesus alone in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and we beheld his glory now they came out of there my came off of the mountain they they said jesus told jesus we don't understand it we thought that elijah was to first come and jesus said elijah shall come and restore all things and he has come you mean they went all of this time and they didn't see you mean they actually had been listening to the prophet's message all of this time and they didn't still see that it was the revealed ministry of the son of man that they were looking at their their bridegroom the very thing that they have been longing for their healing their deliverance their revival their rapture their grace everything that they had been looking for was found right there in the word made manifest but they and jesus well god said the prophet god sent a prophet praise the name of the lord we've got to come to a map transfiguration [Applause] everything else has got to drop and came from you and we have got to see that this is christ the anointed vindicated word and it's christ and christ alone [Applause] he is the dynamics he is the power of transformation [Applause] you see the prophet says the mechanics don't run the church and i'm closing it's the dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word the prophet would go on and say what god promised for the hour look for it to be fulfilled you must look to him because he is the word and the only way you can look to the word is look to him look to him he is the word and the word promised for this day is to be fulfilled this day amen noah's time could not be fulfilled this day it was only a time moses time and so forth but this is the day that god has promised these things and now and that we're now enjoying can i get an amen these things that we're now seeing that the world is laughing at this great momentous power of the holy spirit that can change a sinner's heart that can take a lukewarm church member and give him a testimony that will set the church of fire from where he come out of it's the dynamic that got into the word now i'm closing with this you see the prophet of god said that the pharisees and sadducees could not recognize him because they didn't understand that he was to come a son of man you see they didn't understand what moses meant when he said the lord thy god shall raise up a prophet like and unto me so many has missed him today because they have not understood when jesus said so shall it be at the revealing of the son of man that this is not just a man this is elohim is that okay we are not just in the presence of a man this is not a human being this is the person of elohim [Applause] this is the person that wants to visit you in your seat this is elohim the self-existing one before there was even a molecule yet by this power of his word he said let there be [Music] [Applause] we are in the presence of the one who can change circumstances in a manner of just a millisecond get your eyes off of the impossibilities and get your eyes upon elohim get your eyes upon christ the anointed one the lord himself which is the dynamics which is the person of the holy ghost who is anointing your life to bring about a manifestation of every promise for this last days it's not you he said i am divine you are the branch without me you cannot bring forth fruits you've got to have his word seed impregnate you you must receive him and to them who receive him is given power to become manifested sons adopted sons mature sons who can handle the word who left to christ the one who has been transfigured before them and said i'll follow him i'm following him to my body change i am following him to the millennium i'm following him to the merit supper i will not leave him i follow him through my soul of it [Applause] you see the prophet of god in the presence of god unrecognized said if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings now i want you to make it very personal because he is here meeting us appearing to us in these meetings for what purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest then i say to you this promised word has already been made manifest he's here the dynamics is here the anointed messiah is here he's here in this meeting it's not a lesser jesus oh if i could have lived in 2000 years ago the same jesus has revealed himself in the same way it's the word made manifest he's here oh if i could have only been at brother branham's meetings but today we've just got a little bit less for jesus sometimes we act as if we've got a lesser jesus when we heard it i don't know which one of the brothers said it but the same jesus that was revealed a son of man revealing the son of man is the vindicated anointed word that is in this meeting and the mighty angel accompanies this message always always always whether you can feel him or not always whether we believe it or not always it is not a lesser jesus it's the same jesus the manifested word that's here for you to touch him for you to touch him for you to reach out in faith and say that's my messiah that's my healer my deliverer my holy ghost my rapture my joy my revival my chain breaker that is my headship that's my identity that is my elohim that is my melchizedek what are you looking for you can have it it's found in christ daniel looked and he was the headstone [Applause] ezekiel looked and he was the will in the middle of a wheel martha looked and he was the resurrection of the life john looked and he was the mighty angel i looked and he's my mighty angel he's my bridegroom he's my headship he's my rapture he's my joy he's my deliverance he is my all in all he is my absolute look and live look away to jesus look and see yourself healed see yourself delivered it's a finished work [Applause] satan you don't have enough get out of here left lost people come out of the jail there's a fresh baptism of the holy ghost to anoint your eyes have your eagle eyes there you need a flesh baptism of the holy ghost that's why this is a revival to revive that which you already have [Applause] when jesus came he said this day this scripture's fulfilled he said the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings under the meat he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives in the opening of this prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and then he closed the book because the last part was for his second coming and people are looking at judgment and they think the judgment applies to them oh but the mighty angel has come down the wicked one with supreme authority looking upon his elect with a pardon a pardon if you can receive it you have a pardon if you can receive him you have grace if you can receive him you have the deliverance and the healing of body spirit and soul healing of your imagination healing of your conscience healing of your reasoning healing of your mind healing body spirit and soul get your attention the one you've been looking for is here look but are you ready for the second coming are you ready for what he's going to do in the second coming he's going to comfort i'm going to send you the comforter it's going to be the spirit of truth he's going to take the veil off of your eyes he's going to anoint your eyes with i said and he's going to comfort them that are mourning you know what that means it means that we've been mourning long enough well he's coming praise god but i'm just in defeat i just wish that i could have victory we've been mourning long enough to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes [Applause] the devil's been trying to paint a just a doom and gloom over ashes the devil tried to destroy you to burn you up and he's tried to just make your life full of ashes but god promised in this second coming in the word coming the anointed messiah is going to bring forth beauty for ashes [Applause] the oil of joy for mourning oh brother jonathan where am i going to find the oil of joy it's going to be the stimulation of revelation it's going to be the new wine it's going to be the power of the holy ghost that is going to bring joy you're not going to mourn you're going to be happy you're not going to be in defeat you're going to be shouting you're not going to be no you're going to shout and dance because this is the day of jubilee this is victory i am his victory praise the name of the lord i got to doing that last sunday at church or the sunday before and i got drunk [Music] i got some of that joy that began to flood my soul and i danced all over my platform and then me and a few others just had us a good old-fashioned jericho march you say we don't do that today in the mess of churches well i sure did and then you know what happened i was on a plane ride and i began to read about i was coming home from from a little trip there in canada and i began to read about how that the prophet got so carried away that he lost himself and he got he got his feet dangling up on the platform or upon the pulpit i tell you what i got so caught up on that service that i found for the first time i found myself on a platform on the pulpit [Music] don't get scared i'm just saying brother brother sister there is a joy of the lord that'll make you drunk you'll dance you'll sing you're shout you'll wave your hands you'll wave the flag of victory i'll tell you it's not just for the preacher it's for those that have been liberated the lord himself is the holy ghost that has come to make us liberated sons and daughters of god get out of that jail get out of that defeat get out of that ruins me attitude get out of that idea that no one loves you and god don't love you and i'm gonna miss the rapture [Music] too late i'm feeling good he's going to give oil of joy for mourning are you ready the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness [Applause] i hear from everyone there's just such a heavy weight we're just so burdened down i'm not chastising you because it's the spirit of the age it's a spirit of heaviness do i praise him do i not i don't feel like praising god so i might be a hypocrite because i just don't feel like praising god this service and i don't want to be a hypocrite you know good and well the devil's told you that it's a spirit of heaviness well i just had a bad week and i'm just going to come to church and just sit there and because i had a bad week but the promise is when the spirit of the lord comes he is going to bring the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness the prophet of god said that we are priests unto our high priest and we come into the house of god with the fruit of joy and praise and thanksgiving unto our god not defeat but greater is he that is in me god is the mighty conqueror god is my deliverer god is my healer i'm not looking at my symptoms i'm healed the prophet of god said if god promised you something go get it quit sitting in your seat and wishing you could be healed go get it every day you wake up say i am you're not lying you are healed it's the devil laughing you into thinking that you have to put up with that spirit but god has taken the happiness off of our hearts now we can praise him how do we praise him by speaking the word i am healed i [Applause] am i am that i am is here he's in me throw down that heavy weight throw down that spirit of oppression [Applause] you heard me throw it down [Applause] i'm not picking up that that spirit of oppression or anymore [Applause] i'm a daughter of god i've got a right to speak the spoken word over my condition and the word says by his traps i am healed speak your way out of that shell [Applause] speak your way out of that condition speak your way out of those symptoms speak your way out of that wells bailey jonah your way out of that grave jesus you can put me in that ground but in three days i'm coming out and the same promise that is over the bridegroom is over the pride the same spirit that raised christ if it dwells in you it'll quicken it'll quick it it's the dynamics that come to the mechanics to make this word flesh [Applause] [Music] get out of that jail [Applause] a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified where have we found that at psalms the first chapter the trees of righteousness that is going to bring forth three destinative fruit it's going to be god's fruit in the prophet season and it's going to manifest trees of righteousness branches that are men of plot manifesting pentecostal fruit that is not looking at a jesus in a day gone by but a jesus that is living in them saying i have been planted to bring forth fruit of jesus christ in my life what are you looking for let the musicians come [Applause] he's here i was reading where the prophet says god wants to be manifested this day we have seen god express his desire to be seen to be known to vindicate his presence with great pleasure god has proved his word to those ordained to see it the world won't see me but you'll see me because i live you'll live also look see his word made manifest and you'll live amen now you see if you can see him if you can see that manifested word it'll release the desires that you have what are you looking for you see whatever you're looking for is coming from a need in your own life maybe you're needing deliverance and so you're looking to him and saying lord i'm looking to you to find deliverance maybe you need healing so the message is focused you down now he said if you can look to the word and believe it by his stripes you are healed you need the holy ghost and you look to acts the second chapter that this promises is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off you see repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost brother branham says that what i've seen in my own ministry seen him done you compile the volumes on this platform here if i wrote in details what i've seen him do just in my own ministry seen him do it he had more success in my ministry than he did in his own this is right this is recording now remember he had more success now not me he had that's right you see it's the friend of the bridegroom his whole his whole vision his whole goal is just to get the bride to fall in love with christ and john said i i've got to decrease because my heart is full of joy what i've been sent to do i've accomplished it behold the lamb of god now remember he had more success not me you see again we don't have a lesser jesus the same jesus is here can you just bow your heads and just sing something what are you looking for what do you need can you look beyond just some modern day teaching can you look beyond that well he's greater than a psychologist he's greater than some medicine just to numb

that we're living in amen and you wonder why the devil's fought and fighting and we we need preaching like this right here because there is there is there is a spirit that is trying to take the authority and the power out of this message and buddy hallelujah the authority of the bride is the groom it's the word can you say amen i want that word i want the preeminence can you say amen amen every denomination started as especially the pentecostal denomination started with a glorious liberty amen every move whether it was the even even the luther the power of god was in luther's day the power of god was with wesley sick were healed dead were raised the power of god was with pentecost 1906 amen but as they get away from the word man then they have to develop creed and then they have to bring in the psychologists and then they have to bring in all of these other things and i want to tell you there has never ever been the supernatural like it was in this message the vindication of this message is greater than any other message of the seven ages hallelujah don't let this message just become a formal dry theological seminary experience we must have the supernatural in our lives in our church we must have the holy ghost or you'll never overcome can you say amen to that amen so we appreciated that and i i'm i'm glad that that we can come and lay hands on the sick and expect
