[33:40] 5 like to say it is good to be back home
[33:43] um we had some we have some good
[33:44] Services while he's out on the road it's
[33:47] always it's always good to see the Lord

[33:53] promised to be in the midst and going to
[33:57] different Church churches and seeing
[33:58] that they're they're holding up the same
[34:00] standard preaching the same message and
[34:02] God has proven proven with the same
[34:04] signs and wonders it's always a sh
[34:06] assuring that we're not by ourselves but
[34:08] there's a body around the world Amen
[34:10] Daniel 3
[34:12] and7 um the Bible would say therefore at
[34:14] that time when all the people heard the
[34:16] sound of the Cornet the flute the harp
[34:19] the suck butt Sultry and all the kinds
[34:22] of music and all the people the the
[34:25] Nations and the languages fell down and
[34:26] worship the golden image that
[34:28] Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
[34:30] wherefore at the at that time certain
[34:32] chadians come near and accuse the Jews
[34:35] and they spake to and they spake and
[34:37] said to the King Nebuchadnezzar oh King
[34:39] live forever thou oh King has made a
[34:42] decree that every man that shall hear
[34:44] the sound of the Cornet the flute the
[34:46] harp the sack butt the sultry the deimer
[34:49] and all the kinds of music shall fall
[34:51] down and worship the golden image and
[34:53] who so falleth not down and worship that
[34:56] he should be cast in in the midst of the
[34:58] burning fiery furnace and there were
[35:00] certain Jews and so he see the Bible
[35:03] lets us know that they were coming
[35:04] against the Jews but now it's coming
[35:06] down to just a certain few there are
[35:08] certain Jews whom thou has set over the

[35:13] Babylon Shadrach meach abedo these men
[35:16] oh King have not regarded thee they
[35:19] serve not thy Gods nor nor worship the
[35:21] golden image which thou Hast set up then
[35:24] in Philippians 2 and 5 let this mine be
[35:28] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[35:31] who being in the form of God thought it
[35:33] not robbery to be equal with God but
[35:35] made himself of no reputation and took
[35:38] upon the form of a servant and was made
[35:41] in the likeness of men and being found
[35:43] in the fashion as a man he humbled
[35:45] himself and become obedient unto death
[35:48] even death of the Cross amen can we bow
[35:51] our heads this evening dear gracious
[35:53] Heavenly Father Lord we want to say
[35:55] thank you Lord for this season Lord that
[35:58] we are in the Resurrection season father
[36:00] Lord I believe it's more than just the
[36:02] day but it's a reality father Lord what
[36:05] you done 2,000 years ago father but that
[36:08] Resurrection is still living today
[36:09] Father and Lord as we come into this
[36:12] part of the service I ask that you would
[36:13] anoint me Father Lord you know the needs
[36:16] and in the building father the hearts
[36:17] the desires father only you can meet
[36:19] them Father Lord we need you tonight
[36:22] Lord we ask these things in your
[36:23] precious name amen you may be seated and
[36:27] I'm just going to continue on on the
[36:29] thought I've been preaching to people
[36:31] that that know their God um it's just
[36:33] something I've been studying on for some
[36:36] time so so I hope it's okay if I just
[36:38] continue on that but the Bible would
[36:40] tell us that the mystery of God should
[36:42] be finished so I believe that the
[36:44] understanding of who God is has been
[36:46] poured out in this generation where God
[36:48] is no longer veiled but the veil that
[36:50] had hid God has been loosed where we can
[36:53] see him in a reality we can experience
[36:55] his power experience his his being and
[36:59] and brother and brother Brandon would
[37:00] talk about the king that wanted his
[37:03] people to know him more but he also
[37:05] wanted to know his people more and so
[37:07] what he would do is he would change his
[37:09] mask he would change his form and take
[37:11] on the form of a peasant and and I like
[37:14] how brother Brandon he he tells the
[37:16] story he says the delegates would come
[37:18] up to him and said what are you doing he
[37:21] says I'm I'm going to go cut wood with
[37:23] the wood Chopper I'm going to go teal
[37:25] the ground with the tiller I'm going to
[37:27] go prune the vines with the pruners I'm
[37:29] going to take off my Royal garments and
[37:32] take on uh a peasant clothes so that my
[37:35] people can know me it didn't change who
[37:38] he was but he changed his form in order
[37:41] for somebody to seek him in a reality
[37:44] and so he would take on another form and
[37:47] and and reveal himself as a peasant and
[37:50] so would God wanted to know his people
[37:52] more but he also wanted you to know him
[37:54] more and so he would take on a form of a
[37:56] man and would experience the Pains of a
[37:59] man he would experience grief at the
[38:01] tomb of Lazarus he would experience
[38:04] weariness on the boat he would
[38:06] experience self-will in the Garden of
[38:08] Gethsemane he was wanting to know you
[38:10] more and so he would take on the form of
[38:13] a take on the form of humanity the Bible
[38:16] would tell us in Hebrews 4:15 for we
[38:19] have not a high priest which cannot be
[38:21] touched with the fing of our infirmities
[38:24] but with an all points tempted like as
[38:26] we are yet without sin it was God taking
[38:29] on the form of man so that he could feel
[38:31] your pain it was God taking on the form
[38:34] of man have having Judas his best friend
[38:36] turn against him so that he can
[38:38] experience the pain you go through when
[38:40] you have friends that turn against you
[38:42] he was taken on the form of man so that
[38:45] he could know you but at the same time
[38:47] he wanted you to know him so he would
[38:49] take on this form and brother Brandon
[38:51] would tell us that God was veiled behind
[38:53] Badger skins and when Christ would come
[38:56] he says that veil was rent from top to
[38:58] bottom and there stood The Mercy Seat
[39:00] upon the cross he says the veil was rent
[39:03] and he says and he asked the question
[39:05] why would he rent The Veil because he
[39:07] wanted them to see The Mercy Seat he
[39:09] wanted them to see him as who he was so
[39:12] in order for you to see him as who he
[39:15] was the veil had to be rent and in order
[39:18] for that Veil to be rent he had to take
[39:20] the form of humanity and I'm so thankful
[39:24] that he wanted you to know him so he
[39:26] would take on this for and brother
[39:27] Brandon would say this and that's what
[39:29] God did it's the same God all the time
[39:32] God in the form of the Father the spirit
[39:34] the pillar of fire the same God was made
[39:37] flesh and dwelt Among Us and more faith
[39:39] brought out so he could be seen he
[39:42] wanted to be seen he wanted to be
[39:44] experienced he wanted somebody to know
[39:47] him in the power of the Resurrection in
[39:49] the dark times in the good times when
[39:51] you feel like you're all by yourself
[39:53] when you feel like you're all alone he
[39:55] wanted you to experience him you see
[39:57] this Easter season is more than just a
[40:00] holiday it's a reality it was God coming
[40:02] to Earth and letting you know I want you
[40:05] to know me I want you to experience I
[40:08] want you to experience a a sustainer a
[40:10] lifegiver a health Giver in the time of
[40:13] trouble it was God unveiled so that the
[40:16] world could be seen and and what is so
[40:18] incredible as brother Brandon would say
[40:20] there stood The Mercy Seat upon the
[40:22] cross but they were blinded to it he
[40:25] says there they there stood the Jews
[40:26] looking up The Mercy Seat looking at God
[40:29] but could not see him but the elected
[40:32] would see him and brother brandom says
[40:34] it's the same thing today and brother
[40:36] Brandon would say now it's repeated
[40:38] again the Traditions then on the day of
[40:40] Pentecost the world the word comeing was
[40:42] in the form of the son of man and they
[40:44] begin to organize it at and at IA Rome
[40:47] and the first thing they went to
[40:49] Methodist Baptist Presbyterians
[40:51] Pentecostals and so forth It's organized
[40:54] tradition till a man don't know where he
[40:56] stands
[40:57] oh my God wants a man to know where he
[41:00] stands and he says but glory to God he
[41:02] promised in the last days what he would
[41:05] do he would show his word in plain view
[41:08] open it up before us see it open it up
[41:11] and so just like God would rent The Veil
[41:14] when Christ was upon Earth he would come
[41:16] again in another form and rent the veil
[41:19] so that we could seek him once again we
[41:21] was God didn't want to be seen as a
[41:23] Creed he didn't want to be seen as a
[41:25] tradition he didn't want to be seen as
[41:28] these things there's no reality in a
[41:30] Creed there's no reality in a tradition
[41:33] but God wanted you to experience him in
[41:36] a reality God wanted you to experience
[41:39] him in the power of his resurrection so
[41:41] he would come in another form and rent
[41:44] the veil so that the realities of the
[41:47] supernatural will be poured out upon a
[41:50] family be poured out upon a young person
[41:53] hallelujah it's the windows of Heaven
[41:55] the realities of Jesus Jesus Christ
[41:58] being opened up to a generation that can
[42:01] see him in plain view not as a Creed but
[42:04] as a reality that's what this message
[42:07] come to do is open up your eyes so that
[42:09] you can see that Jesus Christ is the
[42:12] same yesterday today and forever not no
[42:15] quotes not learn doctrines that's good
[42:17] and all but experience the realities of
[42:20] the supernatural so that you can wake up
[42:23] in the morning and if a mind battle
[42:25] comes against your mind you can overcome
[42:27] it when you go through depression you
[42:29] can overcome it when you go through
[42:31] complexes you can overcome it it was God
[42:34] opening up the realities of himself so
[42:37] that you can know him oh God wants to be
[42:40] known you know brother brandham tells us
[42:43] in the adoption series I believe that
[42:45] before the world was created before
[42:48] there was Angels before there was a moon
[42:50] before the before the garden was there
[42:52] in existence he said God was all by
[42:54] himself he was God alone and he inside
[42:57] of the inside of this being was
[43:00] attributes attributes to be a Healer
[43:02] attributes to be a deliverer attributes
[43:05] to be a father and these and these type
[43:07] of things but he says he was God alone
[43:09] and since he was God Alone he couldn't
[43:12] Express himself to nobody and so he
[43:14] created the angels and the angels would
[43:16] worship Him day and night holy holy holy
[43:19] H thou Lord but there was still
[43:21] something missing on the inside of God
[43:24] he wanted to express himself he wanted
[43:27] there to be a people that was bone of
[43:29] his bone life of his life that would
[43:32] experience the power of who he was the
[43:35] Angels were never lost the Angels were
[43:37] Never Bound for hell the Angels were
[43:40] never sick the Angels never went through
[43:42] depression the Angels never went through
[43:44] anxieties the Angels never went through
[43:46] heartbreaks so he couldn't Express
[43:48] himself and so he would create Man In
[43:51] His Image so that he could express
[43:53] himself and now here in the midst of
[43:56] Leo's Satan's eeden God is wanting to
[43:59] express himself as a friend that
[44:02] sticketh closer than a brother oh
[44:04] Hallelujah the same friend that guided
[44:06] Enoch is the same friend that is guiding
[44:09] us today the same friend that come and
[44:11] visited Abraham is the same friend that
[44:14] has come in this generation to let you
[44:16] know I am here to bring forth the
[44:19] promise you're not by yourself trying to
[44:21] make a Rapture I have come in a
[44:24] different form to give you the power the
[44:27] realities to bring forth the
[44:30] supernatural oh Hallelujah and so now
[44:33] there is a certainty of who we are he
[44:36] wanted his bride to know where she stood
[44:39] wanted to know a certainty and brother
[44:41] Brandon would tell us the Holy Spirit
[44:44] has been bound by denominational Rivers
[44:46] for almost 2,000 years but is to be
[44:48] loosed in the evening time by the
[44:50] evening time message the Holy Spirit
[44:53] back in the church again Christ himself
[44:56] re revealed in human flesh in the
[44:59] evening time he sh it he promised it and
[45:02] so he wanted his Spirit to be loosed and
[45:05] come into a people into a flesh being
[45:08] once again and he promised it and he
[45:10] said it he was going to do and I like
[45:12] that brother brand puts it he said it he
[45:15] promised it and so how to take a message
[45:18] to take the realities and bring it into
[45:20] our life and I believe we've received
[45:22] that message and the supernatural has
[45:25] been opened up the Holy Ghost that was
[45:27] bound has now been loosed into our lives
[45:30] again and and and and a lot of this is
[45:32] coming from the unveiling of God so if
[45:34] you haven't heard that in a while it's a
[45:36] powerful message and brother Brandon
[45:37] would say it in the unveiling of God I
[45:39] see the Mighty God unveiled I see him
[45:42] pull back the cre the denominations pull
[45:44] back the Skeptics the educational
[45:46] programs and everything walk forward and
[45:49] stand there and and I like how he says
[45:51] this you think Creeds could conquer him
[45:54] you think denominations could conquer
[45:56] him you think think the world council
[45:58] could conquer him he conquered
[46:00] everything broke every feather ripped
[46:03] open hell tore off the seal entered into
[46:05] the holiest of holies unveiled himself
[46:08] to us being the word the same yesterday
[46:11] today and forever and he says amen how I
[46:15] love him and he says you think Creeds
[46:17] could conquer him you think that
[46:19] Traditions could keep him from coming
[46:21] and revealing himself to you the devil
[46:24] has another thing coming he thought he
[46:26] could keep you from the realities of God
[46:28] so he would throw traditions on you he
[46:30] would throw Creeds on you he would put
[46:32] you in false doctrines trying to keep
[46:34] you from receiving the realities but God
[46:37] my brother Brandon would say you think
[46:39] that could conquer him but he ripped off
[46:41] the veil he tore off the things that you
[46:44] was bound by and would reveal himself to
[46:47] you so that you can experience him oh
[46:50] Hallelujah so that you can experience
[46:53] him he's been unveiled to us in this
[46:55] generation and then brother brandom says
[46:58] how by the word oh my that's how deity
[47:01] is coming or midst by the word cuz
[47:03] everybody claims to have deity the
[47:05] Baptists have deity the Presbyterians
[47:08] the Pentecostals they all got deity but
[47:10] what is deity what is deity it's the
[47:13] supernatural word in the beginning was
[47:15] the word the word was with God and the
[47:18] Word was God so in order to have deity
[47:21] in the midst you have to have the word
[47:24] oh come on now so in order for God to
[47:26] have a people that could experience
[47:29] himself there had to be a perfect word
[47:31] and so he would get a messenger and form
[47:34] him and make him with a certain with a
[47:36] certain demeanor a certain desire
[47:38] certain makeup and would give him a
[47:40] message so that you could have a perfect
[47:43] word so that you can experience him so
[47:46] that he could unveil himself to you and
[47:48] you see brother Brandon in that message
[47:50] the unveiling of God talks about the
[47:52] violin and brother Brandon our brother
[47:54] Andrew preached on it when he was here
[47:55] last and I love brother Brandon he talks
[47:58] about it and he says the auctioneer says
[48:00] what am I offer and he says they looked
[48:02] at and didn't realize what was there
[48:04] nobody was willing to pay the price and
[48:06] he says I I'll give you $1 another
[48:08] person says $5 $10 $15 and brother
[48:12] brandom says now there was a man that
[48:13] was standing in the midst that didn't
[48:15] think it should go for that little and
[48:17] so what he would do is he would come and
[48:19] pick up the bow he would tighten up the
[48:21] bow he would pick up that that violin
[48:24] and would start to play music and he
[48:26] says everybody started to cry because
[48:28] they' never heard such beautiful music
[48:31] and then the auctioneer says now what
[48:33] are you offering and one person says
[48:35] 1,000 5,000 10,000 and brother brandom
[48:39] says what was it the Master's Hand
[48:41] revealed what was veiled in the old
[48:43] instrument oh man it took the Master's
[48:46] Hand in this generation to reveal what
[48:49] was inside of this word it was failed by
[48:52] Traditions it was failed your rapture
[48:54] was been right here but it was failed
[48:56] your body change was right there but it
[48:58] was failed but God would come in this
[49:00] generation and rip off the veil rip off
[49:03] the seals rip off these things it says
[49:06] here's a Rapture here's a body change
[49:08] here's your future hope here's the
[49:10] Millennium it's all right here here is
[49:13] the fullness of who I am I'm unveiling
[49:16] myself so that you can see me oh
[49:20] Hallelujah it was the Master's Hand that
[49:22] would reveal what was hidden there your
[49:25] name was hidden there oh the Lamb's Book
[49:27] of Life had your name on it had
[49:29] everything right there but it was veiled
[49:31] to us but the Master's Hand would unveil
[49:34] it and say hey you didn't become seed at
[49:36] the new birth you always was a Son of
[49:38] God you was in my mind from before the
[49:41] foundation of the world and brother
[49:43] Brandon would say so now in this age
[49:45] when the old denominational and
[49:47] traditional veil has been rent from the
[49:49] word of God so it can be manifested see
[49:52] what I mean the tradition says all those
[49:55] things are passed let us soak a little
[49:57] bit these things are passed but in this
[49:59] last day the traditional veil has been
[50:02] wrent and here stands the pillar of fire
[50:05] see here he is manifesting the word for
[50:09] this day the veil has been rent and so
[50:12] the very purpose of God coming and
[50:15] enveil himself was for his word to be
[50:18] manifested and but I like how brother
[50:20] brandom says it what stood behind the
[50:22] veil was the pillar of fire manifesting
[50:26] the word for this day oh my so there's
[50:28] the mechanics and the Dynamics that was
[50:31] veiled up but once the veil would come
[50:33] come off of it there would be a people
[50:36] that could experience not just the
[50:37] mechanics but the Dynamics and when
[50:39] those two come together it's a
[50:41] Powerhouse that the gates of hell do not
[50:44] know what to do with oh Hallelujah there
[50:47] stands the pillar of fire manifesting
[50:50] the word of God but brother Brandon
[50:51] would say whenever wherever the word is
[50:54] it's always veiled he says the word is
[50:56] UN veiled to the bride but it's veiled
[50:58] to the unbelievers and then he talks
[51:01] about the drama he says one actor can
[51:03] have many different veils have many
[51:05] different masks and he says the word has
[51:08] had many different masks and he talks
[51:10] about he talks about how Moses was
[51:12] veiled and the Bible would say that
[51:14] Moses had a veil his Veil his face his
[51:16] face because he was the
[51:18] word Jesus was veiled the word was
[51:21] veiled in him then brother brandham
[51:23] talks about the Tabernacle and and it's
[51:25] so incredible says the badger skins
[51:28] veiled the glory of God and the people
[51:30] couldn't see it because they couldn't
[51:32] get past the skins and I thought my
[51:34] that's why many people can't see this
[51:37] message is because they can't look past
[51:39] the skins of humanity they can't look
[51:42] past the skins of human flaws and human
[51:44] weaknesses but on the other side of the
[51:47] skin was the shakana glory brother
[51:49] Brandon would say it was the shoe bread
[51:51] that was behind those skins and I think
[51:53] my goodness behind the skins of humanity
[51:56] in this generation was the sh Glory
[51:59] being unveiled it was the shoe bread a
[52:02] spiritual food in due season it was
[52:04] behind the Skins so if we could ever
[52:07] look past the skins of humanity we will
[52:10] see what God is doing in this generation
[52:13] but then brother Brandon continues on
[52:15] that now he's veiled in his bride and
[52:18] what is so incredible is brother Brandon
[52:20] would say it was once an animal living
[52:22] behind those skins talking about the
[52:24] badger skins he says but now with hiding
[52:27] the glory of God it's the housing for
[52:30] the glory of God then he stops and he
[52:32] says so can your skins be changed and be
[52:36] made into a housing place for the glory
[52:39] of God God dwelling in
[52:42] humanity so you see the purpose of God
[52:45] unveiling himself was God coming inside
[52:48] of humanity to fulfill his words so just
[52:52] like God was dwelling behind Baner skins
[52:55] in the Tabernacle but now he's dwelling
[52:57] behind human skins he's he's dwelling
[53:00] behind a teenager skin a young boy skin
[53:02] a daddy's skin a mama skin inside of
[53:05] those skins is no longer a carnal nature
[53:08] it's no longer the things of the world
[53:10] now it's deity inside of those skins the
[53:14] same Pillar of Fire that was veiled
[53:16] behind the badger skins is now veiled
[53:19] inside of a human skin Oh hallelujah
[53:22] it's the same Pillar of Fire that L it
[53:25] led the children of Israel out of Egypt
[53:27] is the same Pillar of Fire that is
[53:29] leading this bride all the way to the
[53:32] coming of the Lord so God want enveil
[53:34] himself to be veiled in your skins that
[53:37] is just so incredible the God would come
[53:40] and pay the price for your sins he would
[53:42] have his beard plucked out he would be
[53:44] beaten he would be scorched he would go
[53:46] through these things so that he can be
[53:48] veiled in your skins oh my so he's
[53:50] taking the ordinary and making something
[53:53] great and brother Brandon would say it
[53:54] was God above us God with us now it is
[53:58] God in us he's taking something ordinary
[54:01] and I like it brother brand I talked
[54:02] some of it last time but brother Brandon
[54:04] preaches the super sign and he says that
[54:07] they think by super they got to do away
[54:09] with the ordinary and make something
[54:11] great he says they're doing away with
[54:14] the old the old automobiles he says it
[54:16] used to take 16 days to get over to the
[54:18] West Coast now it takes four days he
[54:21] says they used to have two lane two lane
[54:23] highways now there's four lane highways
[54:25] he says they're something great and
[54:27] something super but they're doing away
[54:30] with the ordinary or they're doing away
[54:33] with with uh yeah with the ordinary and
[54:35] I think M we see that taking place here
[54:37] here in the in Tulsa Oklahoma City
[54:40] you've got the old part of Tulsa and the
[54:42] new part of Tulsa instead of just
[54:44] refurnishing and rebuilding the old part
[54:46] of Tulsa they do away with that and

[58:22] hungry I want to see the supernatural I
[58:25] want to see his presence like never
[58:27] before I'm hungry for the
[58:30] supernatural oh my brother brandom says
[58:32] God changes his mask but never his
[58:34] nature oh my changes his mask but never
[58:38] his nature so in other words when he was
[58:40] veiled in Moses his nature brought forth
[58:43] the supernatural it was his nature that
[58:46] would bring forth lies that would bring
[58:48] forth the lies in these things when he
[58:50] was veiled behind Badger skins it was
[58:53] his nature that would bring the dead Rod
[58:55] back to life when he was veiled in Jesus
[58:58] his nature would fulfill the word and
[59:01] today when he's veiled in your skins his
[59:04] nature is the same as when it was behind
[59:07] the badger skins oh my that Old Rod that
[59:10] was dead but there was a life that could
[59:12] bring it back to life oh my you might be
[59:15] dead this evening you might be in
[59:17] addictions you might be in trespasses
[59:19] but the same of kind of Glory can come
[59:21] inside of your skins and bring this germ
[59:23] seed of God that is on the inside back
[59:26] to life so that you can see the
[59:29] manifestation of the word of God oh
[59:33] hallelujah it's the same nature he's
[59:36] taking humanity and bringing forth the
[59:40] same nature brother Brandon would say
[59:42] super Ray super ways super everything
[59:44] got to be greater than the ordinary
[59:46] one's man he has a super house that
[59:49] change it every year 1962 model houses
[59:52] won't be no good in 1963 your
[59:55] refrigerator has got to be a little
[59:57] super it's got to be a step up it's got
[59:59] to step up a little more just put a
[1:00:01] little more or a little more ornaments
[1:00:03] on it and make you swap the old one in
[1:00:06] and pay a couple $300 more to get
[1:00:08] another one and so they're doing away
[1:00:11] with the ordinary and trying to make
[1:00:13] something great but God has taken
[1:00:15] Humanity has taken the ordinary and is
[1:00:18] making something great right here as
[1:00:21] human weaknesses and brother Brandon
[1:00:23] would he would say this in the Easter
[1:00:24] seal now notice Pentecost their bodies
[1:00:27] were quickened by the new life they
[1:00:29] received that makes me feel religious
[1:00:31] think now here was men fishermen Tax
[1:00:34] Collectors humble Little Women and just
[1:00:36] ordinary Housewives little virgin girls
[1:00:40] they were believers they were believing
[1:00:42] that this was the truth their bodies
[1:00:45] were quickened who was that brother Josh
[1:00:47] the ordinary people not the not the not
[1:00:50] the great flashy ones or the ones with
[1:00:52] money the ones with great intellect
[1:00:54] Peter couldn't even sign his name but it
[1:00:57] was an ordinary man that God would come
[1:01:00] and reveal himself to so God takes the
[1:01:03] ordinary and brother Brandon he would
[1:01:05] call these men or these these
[1:01:06] individuals ordinary he says Joshua was
[1:01:09] an ordinary man but God calls the son to
[1:01:12] stand still Mary was just an ordinary
[1:01:15] girl but through her come deity Abraham
[1:01:19] was just an ordinary man but through his
[1:01:21] seed would come the Savior Noah was just
[1:01:24] an ordinary farmer but through him God
[1:01:27] saved his seed Moses was just an
[1:01:29] ordinary man but would defeat the
[1:01:32] greatest military upon Earth and right
[1:01:34] here is ordinary individuals that God is
[1:01:37] calling to be a rapturing generation you
[1:01:40] might got fls you might got weaknesses
[1:01:43] you might got human mistakes you might
[1:01:45] got a past you might got things you're
[1:01:47] not proud of but God has called the
[1:01:49] ordinary God has called the ordinary and
[1:01:52] has poured out deity inside of your life
[1:01:56] that goes past the Falls past the
[1:01:58] mistakes past the addictions past the
[1:02:01] past and say hey I'm calling you for a
[1:02:04] special purpose somebody's got to make a
[1:02:06] Rapture somebody's got to see a body
[1:02:08] change somebody's got to reain in the
[1:02:11] Millennium and I'm calling Ordinary
[1:02:13] People to do
[1:02:15] it I'm calling Ordinary People to do it
[1:02:19] brother the Brandon was say Jesus never
[1:02:20] took them come the people to be his
[1:02:22] disciples he took the unlearned people
[1:02:25] the fish
[1:02:26] nobody's connected with their churches
[1:02:28] and things he just got ordinary men Tax
[1:02:31] Collectors Farmers Fishers and so forth
[1:02:34] to do his work see cuz they are nothing
[1:02:37] and then he can make something out of
[1:02:39] them see as long as they keep thinking
[1:02:41] or keep knowing that they're nothing
[1:02:43] than God can work and I say my that's
[1:02:46] why new life that's what new life
[1:02:48] Outreach knows it's we are Ordinary
[1:02:50] People we're nothing but God has taken
[1:02:53] this nothing and has made something
[1:02:55] through it but oh my brother Brandon
[1:02:57] would say God hides himself in a simple
[1:03:00] little wash woman or an or ordinary man
[1:03:02] with dinner under his arms kiss his wife
[1:03:05] and children goodbye and go out there
[1:03:07] maybe hide himself in that man to do
[1:03:10] something that an ark Bishop would know
[1:03:12] nothing about see you don't hear him
[1:03:14] blow no horns and send it out God just
[1:03:17] gets the glory the simple hear it hander
[1:03:20] glad now God was hiding himself in the
[1:03:23] Simplicity of a baby he hiding him self
[1:03:26] in the Simplicity of a common family oh
[1:03:29] my and here God is again hiding himself
[1:03:32] in some empty vessels in Simplicity God
[1:03:35] hiding himself in ordinary nobodies you
[1:03:38] know brother the Bible would tell us of
[1:03:40] the widow woman and Elisha her sons were
[1:03:43] about to be sold and all that she had
[1:03:45] was a little bit of oil in in in in a
[1:03:48] little vessel and the and the pr were to
[1:03:50] come up to her and say how much oil do
[1:03:52] you got and she says this is all I God
[1:03:54] and he would say okay go to the
[1:03:56] neighbors go abroad go out there and get
[1:03:59] all of the empty vessels get all of the
[1:04:02] empty vessels and bring him to me and he
[1:04:05] and and as they would bring all of these
[1:04:06] empty vessels into the house he would
[1:04:09] take the little course of oil that was a
[1:04:11] little bit hair and would poured in the
[1:04:13] first oil or the first vessel poured
[1:04:15] into the second vessel all that was in
[1:04:17] the course of oil he would pour inside
[1:04:20] of those vessels but he didn't run out
[1:04:23] after the first one he didn't run out
[1:04:25] after the the second one but all the
[1:04:27] empty vessels that would be called he
[1:04:30] would have enough to fill them oh one
[1:04:32] little church God going run out of
[1:04:34] himself after 120 in the upper room but
[1:04:37] all of the empty vessels that he is
[1:04:39] calling for this generation ordinary
[1:04:42] vessels Broken Vessels heartbroken
[1:04:44] vessels vessels with with mistakes and
[1:04:47] flaws all of the empty vessels he is
[1:04:49] called he is still feeling he is still
[1:04:52] pouring out deity maybe you're here
[1:04:54] tonight say brother Josh I'm empty I
[1:04:57] want to know this God he is still
[1:04:59] filling the empty vessels if you're
[1:05:02] willing to empty yourself out and say
[1:05:04] Lord Veil yourself in me he will come oh
[1:05:08] you notice that Elijah Elisha didn't say
[1:05:11] go get all the vessels he said get the
[1:05:14] empty vessels not the full ones not the
[1:05:16] on that are half full not the ones that
[1:05:18] are 3/4 full get the empty ones oh my
[1:05:21] too many of us want D to come in but
[1:05:24] we're still full of bitterness we're
[1:05:26] still full of Pride we're still full of
[1:05:28] Skeptics we're still full of these
[1:05:30] things but Empty Out Your Vessel empty
[1:05:32] out your being you might be smart you
[1:05:34] might know this message backwards and
[1:05:36] forwards but you got to empty yourself
[1:05:38] out come on Church you got to empty
[1:05:40] yourself out out of all of your
[1:05:42] knowledge out of all of your learning
[1:05:44] out of everything that you got you've
[1:05:46] learned throughout the years you got to
[1:05:48] empty yourself out so that deity can
[1:05:50] come and dwell in
[1:05:53] humanity come on now God don't want
[1:05:56] learning he wants deity in humanity he
[1:05:59] don't care how many quotes you can quote
[1:06:01] he don't care how many scriptures you
[1:06:03] can quote he don't care how much
[1:06:05] knowledge you got he wants deity inside
[1:06:08] of
[1:06:10] humanity the priests they could quote
[1:06:12] the scriptures I'm preaching now all of
[1:06:15] those other ones they were learned in
[1:06:17] scripture they were learned in theology
[1:06:19] they went to the seminaries but they
[1:06:21] missed deity you can be learned in the
[1:06:23] seminaries you can be learned in this
[1:06:25] message but if you miss deity you miss
[1:06:28] the entire unveiling of God but I say
[1:06:31] Lord I'm not worried about my learning I
[1:06:34] want to see deity I want to see the
[1:06:36] realities of Jesus Christ in my
[1:06:40] flesh Hallelujah huj I may be just
[1:06:43] ordinary Hallelujah but Lord make me
[1:06:46] something special that's why New Life
[1:06:48] Outreach is separate from all of the
[1:06:50] other what 17 churches just an ordinary
[1:06:53] church but she was in
[1:06:56] this ordinary church was broken this
[1:06:58] ordinary church was hurt she was scarred
[1:07:02] but her deity would come and dwell
[1:07:04] inside of New Life Outreach dwell inside
[1:07:07] of New Life Outreach brother Brandon
[1:07:09] would say the Shak Glory manifest him it
[1:07:12] brings forth the Word of Promise right
[1:07:14] out to you that's the reason that he had
[1:07:17] TOA Moses face because in him was the
[1:07:20] word he veiled Jesus a humble little man
[1:07:23] to keep from to keep them from seeing
[1:07:26] Jehovah and he veils himself today in
[1:07:29] Earth and
[1:07:30] vessels with the shik glory and I and I
[1:07:33] love this part the outside looks like a
[1:07:35] bunch of Holy Rollers bad your skins but
[1:07:37] the inside hides the sh kind of Glory oh
[1:07:41] the outside of you the the world looks
[1:07:43] at and say I know what he used to do I
[1:07:45] know what she used to do but in the
[1:07:47] inside there was deity with the Brandon
[1:07:49] would say what was in the inside of that
[1:07:51] skin back there what once what was on
[1:07:54] the inside the skin back to the old
[1:07:56] Bounder skins which there was no beauty
[1:07:58] that we should desire and it when it was
[1:08:01] made flesh and dwelt Among Us it still
[1:08:03] had no beauty that we should desire it
[1:08:06] and now the same thing today there was
[1:08:08] nothing in a man or a woman that can be
[1:08:11] desired it's what is behind there that's
[1:08:14] what it is well you say that fellow I I
[1:08:16] know he used to be a drunker he used to
[1:08:18] do this I don't care what he used to do
[1:08:21] what's behind the skin what is behind
[1:08:23] there that's what counts and that's why
[1:08:26] the people is blinded the Skins the
[1:08:28] people they say remember when the woman
[1:08:30] used to do I know what she used to do
[1:08:33] but what about now oh and he says that's
[1:08:35] what blinds many people is the Skins the
[1:08:38] people know what you used to do but he
[1:08:40] says I don't care what you used to do
[1:08:43] what about now what is dwelling in there
[1:08:45] now oh my and and you know and and
[1:08:48] that's embarrassed dad but that's what
[1:08:50] I've Loved about Dad all of these years
[1:08:52] he's willing to look past the skins and
[1:08:54] he sees good in every everybody and I
[1:08:56] say Lord let us let us all be that way
[1:08:58] let New Life Outreach be that way that
[1:09:00] can look at somebody that's hurting but
[1:09:02] see deity that can look somebody with
[1:09:05] flaws and see deity let us be a church
[1:09:08] that way oh my brother brandom says the
[1:09:11] Reason God unveiled himself was to
[1:09:13] fulfill his word so the very reason of
[1:09:17] the unveiling of God was for God to come
[1:09:19] in Earth and vessels and the Bible would
[1:09:21] say in 2 Corinthians 4:7 but we have the
[1:09:25] treasure in Earth and vessels that the
[1:09:27] Excellency of the power may be of God
[1:09:30] not of us and so this word has brought a
[1:09:33] certainty where there was no certainty
[1:09:35] in Creeds no certainty in denominations
[1:09:38] but the word has brought us a boldness a
[1:09:41] certainty brother Baron would say this
[1:09:43] and Peter said such as I have I will
[1:09:46] give it to you in the name of Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ excuse me rise up and walk they
[1:09:52] had a hidden power they dressed like
[1:09:54] other men they walked on the street they
[1:09:56] ate like other men but they had a
[1:09:58] blessing on the inside that gave them
[1:10:01] certainty to know where they were
[1:10:04] standing oh my and that's what we need
[1:10:06] today is certainty to know where we are
[1:10:09] standing because with Humanity comes
[1:10:11] fears with Humanity comes complexes with
[1:10:15] Humanity comes insecurities and with
[1:10:18] Humanity comes these other things so we
[1:10:20] needed something to bring a security we
[1:10:23] needed something to bring bring and let
[1:10:25] us know that we don't know what tomorrow
[1:10:28] holds but we know who holds tomorrow
[1:10:31] because in humanity we don't know what
[1:10:33] tomorrow holds and some people get they
[1:10:35] get uh they get anxiety they don't know
[1:10:37] they don't want to go outside because
[1:10:39] they don't know what's going to happen
[1:10:40] or they can't they they can't do this
[1:10:42] they can't go there because of a fear
[1:10:44] it's Humanity that has fears but this
[1:10:47] word has brought us a hidden power that
[1:10:50] there can be certainty that overcomes
[1:10:52] the fears that overcomes Humanity where
[1:10:55] we can face the world and know that I'm
[1:10:58] an overcomer you see we need it there's
[1:11:00] a blessing of a certainty and the Bible
[1:11:03] would say in Isaiah 44 and8 fear ye not
[1:11:06] neither be afraid have not I told thee
[1:11:09] from that time and have declared it ye
[1:11:12] are even my Witnesses is there a god
[1:11:15] beside me yay there was no God I know
[1:11:18] not any so fear not nor be afraid have
[1:11:21] not I told thee and so the certainty
[1:11:24] that we are experiencing is not from a
[1:11:27] feeling not from an emotion but from the
[1:11:29] word of God it's the word of God that is
[1:11:32] letting you know have not I told you
[1:11:34] that you are going to Reign Victorious I
[1:11:37] know you might be in a circumstance now
[1:11:39] but I've already told you that you're
[1:11:41] going to overcome it and then he turns
[1:11:44] it around and says ye are my Witnesses
[1:11:47] how do you become a witness it's deity
[1:11:49] coming on the inside the Bible would
[1:11:51] tell us in Acts 1:8 that ye shall
[1:11:54] receive power after the Holy Ghost has
[1:11:56] come upon you and you shall be Witnesses
[1:11:59] so the word come to comfort and let you
[1:12:02] know that you're going to overcome but
[1:12:04] then it gives a hidden power to overcome
[1:12:07] with oh come on church it's the same
[1:12:09] comforter that is letting you know
[1:12:11] you're going to rain is the same
[1:12:13] comforter that is coming inside and
[1:12:16] raining through you it's not us trying
[1:12:18] to do it ourselves but it's a hidden
[1:12:21] power deity coming inside and and
[1:12:24] fulfilling the word of God oh man you
[1:12:27] see how certain this word is because he
[1:12:30] would say I would have a bride without
[1:12:32] spot and without wrinkle that is
[1:12:34] certainty how would he know that he
[1:12:36] would how could he be so certain because
[1:12:39] he was going to come himself and fulfill
[1:12:42] the word of a spotless bride that's how
[1:12:45] he could be certain and the Bible would
[1:12:47] tell us in Daniel 6:17 and a stone was
[1:12:50] brought and laid upon the mouth of the
[1:12:52] dean and the King sealed it with his own
[1:12:55] signant and with the signant of his
[1:12:56] Lords that the purpose might not change
[1:13:00] concerning Daniel and so since the king
[1:13:02] had a purpose and wanted it to be
[1:13:04] fulfilled he would seal he would he
[1:13:06] would seal it with his own seal and I
[1:13:09] think my another King has done that in
[1:13:12] this generation he wanted there to be a
[1:13:14] bride with spot and with her wrinkle and
[1:13:17] in order for this to take place he had a
[1:13:20] seal it with his own seal oh my then God
[1:13:23] himself would come and seal himself in
[1:13:26] and seal the devil out so that the
[1:13:28] purpose of the word could be fulfilled I
[1:13:31] say little church that's why we can't be
[1:13:33] defeated that's why we can't be overcome
[1:13:36] because there's another Power another
[1:13:38] Authority that has come on the inside
[1:13:41] that is greater than our Humanity that
[1:13:43] is greater than our human weaknesses
[1:13:46] it's the Seal of God coming and
[1:13:48] protecting the purpose of God oh come on
[1:13:51] now it's the Seal of God protecting the
[1:13:54] purpose of God and I say Lord thank you
[1:13:56] for calling me to do a special purpose
[1:13:59] and sealing yourself in me to fulfill it
[1:14:02] and brother Brandon would say this here
[1:14:04] and Daniel went in without any
[1:14:06] uncertainty God is able to deliver from
[1:14:09] the Lions and I believe when the lion
[1:14:11] started up there to look at him there
[1:14:14] stood a Halo of fire around Daniel any
[1:14:17] animal has scared of fire you know that
[1:14:20] those Lions backed off what was it the
[1:14:22] hidden power that was in Daniel's heart
[1:14:25] come out and clothe him all over oh
[1:14:29] little church the hidden power that was
[1:14:31] once on the inside didn't come out of to
[1:14:34] the humanity and would protect him from
[1:14:36] the things he was going through that's
[1:14:39] why you're standing here today and
[1:14:41] haven't lost the battle yet because the
[1:14:43] hidden power that is on the inside has
[1:14:46] come out of your humanity and is
[1:14:48] bringing forth the victory oh and he
[1:14:51] continues on to say it was that hidden
[1:14:53] power the blessing of God God that was
[1:14:55] upon the prophet's life that enshrouded
[1:14:58] him with the Flaming fire like like down
[1:15:01] at dayam that when when Gesa looked and
[1:15:04] saw that there was around Elijah angels
[1:15:06] of fire Chariots of Fire there that
[1:15:09] hidden power was around Daniel and what
[1:15:12] was that hidden power to do it was to
[1:15:14] bring forth a security that hidden power
[1:15:17] on the inside would come out and say hey
[1:15:20] hey Lions you're not taking him I've got
[1:15:22] a purpose for his life and that's why
[1:15:25] the job would say though God slay me yet
[1:15:28] I would trust him there was a hidden
[1:15:30] power bringing forth a certainty of
[1:15:33] security and brother Bron would say that
[1:15:36] Steven had so much of this blessing in
[1:15:38] him till he became a different man and
[1:15:41] what is so incredible he says what
[1:15:43] happened the heavens opened up and the
[1:15:46] spirit that was on him opened the clouds
[1:15:49] went through the Stars through the midst
[1:15:52] until he seen Jesus standing at the
[1:15:55] right hand of the father what was it his
[1:15:58] certainty the hidden power opened up a
[1:16:01] channel that looked past his present
[1:16:04] circumstances come on Church there's a
[1:16:06] hidden power inside of this Pride that
[1:16:08] has opened up a channel that looks past
[1:16:11] all of your present circumstances look
[1:16:14] past the things you're going through and
[1:16:16] sees Jesus at the right hand of the
[1:16:19] father there's been a channel that has
[1:16:21] opened up the supernatural it's the
[1:16:23] hidden blessing of certainty and brother
[1:16:26] Brandon would say this that the devil
[1:16:28] had man blocked from God but when Christ
[1:16:30] came he went beyond the veils of every
[1:16:33] sphere he went beyond the veil of death
[1:16:35] he went beyond the veil of grave and
[1:16:37] rent the veil of sickness rent the veil
[1:16:39] of fear every Veil that there was he
[1:16:42] would destroy and here we stand today in
[1:16:45] this Easter season standing Victorious
[1:16:48] because every fear every anxiety
[1:16:51] everything the devil will throw upon us
[1:16:53] has been rined and here's a channel that
[1:16:56] is opened up if you got lost loved ones
[1:16:59] there's a channel that is opened up if
[1:17:01] you need Deliverance there's a channel
[1:17:03] that has been opened up if you need a
[1:17:05] refilling of the Holy Ghost there's a
[1:17:08] channel that has been opened up where we
[1:17:11] can see stepen saw Jesus he seen the
[1:17:14] realities oh I believe this bride can
[1:17:16] see the realities it wasn't Steven
[1:17:19] making something up he wasn't making up
[1:17:21] an imaginary story but he could see the
[1:17:23] realities and and I believe this bride
[1:17:26] ain't making up stories she ain't making
[1:17:28] up some imagination fairy tales but she
[1:17:31] has experienced the power of the
[1:17:33] Resurrection that has changed her
[1:17:35] desires changed her likes and one day
[1:17:38] it's going to change her body we're not
[1:17:40] making something up we're experiencing a
[1:17:42] hidden power on the inside of our
[1:17:46] Lives hallelujah it's a hidden power oh
[1:17:50] my the world don't know what to do about
[1:17:51] it the devil don't know what to do about
[1:17:53] it but it's hidden inside of some Earth
[1:17:57] vessels oh hallelujah hallelujah he rent
[1:18:01] the veil of sickness the veil of fear
[1:18:03] every ve there was he would destroy and
[1:18:05] all above and there he opened up a
[1:18:07] channel the god used to come down
[1:18:10] through all the corridors of heaven and
[1:18:12] talked to Mankind in the Garden of Eden
[1:18:14] and Satan by sin had them blocked but
[1:18:17] the great high priest with his Anointed
[1:18:20] with his blood excuse me with his blood
[1:18:23] rent through everything rip open every
[1:18:26] rip open and cleared all the skies again
[1:18:29] that God and man could be father and son
[1:18:32] and commune again with another what a
[1:18:34] marvelous thing oh my you see what God
[1:18:37] has done in this generation he has
[1:18:40] brought God and man back in talking
[1:18:43] terms once again it's no longer you
[1:18:45] going to a prophet and saying hey what
[1:18:47] did God tell you are you going to a
[1:18:49] priest and saying hey can you talk to
[1:18:51] God for me but now there's a Channel all
[1:18:54] of those Veil has been opened up that
[1:18:56] you can come before the throne of grace
[1:18:58] with boldness and ask for what you have
[1:19:01] need of and God will bring it the past
[1:19:03] oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon would
[1:19:05] say this brother I'd rather have all of
[1:19:08] that all I rather uh I would rather have
[1:19:11] in all the education all the money you
[1:19:13] can pile up before me all my education I
[1:19:16] will drop it here all my mental theology
[1:19:19] I will leave it here all my wealth I
[1:19:21] will leave it here but the hidden power
[1:19:24] that thing made the certainty of the
[1:19:26] Gospel it will take you to heaven and
[1:19:29] carry you through the valleys of the
[1:19:31] shadow of death oh my that that's the
[1:19:34] reason you know as as we was at the
[1:19:36] Martin's funeral Friday that's the
[1:19:38] reason they can make it through this UNC
[1:19:40] time there's a hidden power there's
[1:19:42] certainty knowing that we're going to
[1:19:44] see him again brother M that's why you
[1:19:46] made it through losing Adam sister Leah
[1:19:48] because there was a certainty knowing
[1:19:50] that we're going to see him again the
[1:19:52] Bible would say Comfort one another with
[1:19:55] these words there's a certainty that has
[1:19:57] been poured out we don't know what's
[1:19:59] going to take place you may die tomorrow
[1:20:02] I might die tomorrow you might lose a
[1:20:03] loved one tomorrow we don't know but
[1:20:05] there's a
[1:20:06] certainty of because of a hidden power
[1:20:09] so the devil knows that he can't take
[1:20:11] away your hidden power but what he can
[1:20:13] do is take away the certainty of it and
[1:20:16] it's give me a few more minutes and I'll
[1:20:17] bring this to a close the Bible would
[1:20:19] say in 1 John
[1:20:20] 3:21 beloved if our heart condemn us not
[1:20:24] then we have confidence toward God and
[1:20:26] so if our heart condemn us not then we
[1:20:29] have certainty and so that's what the
[1:20:31] devil does he's an accuser he will come
[1:20:33] with accusations and say oh yeah that
[1:20:35] God has power to heal God has power to
[1:20:37] save but then he comes and condemns you
[1:20:40] and he changes your certainty towards
[1:20:42] the word of God because you remember in
[1:20:44] the garden God would come and speak to
[1:20:46] Adam and Eve but what happened after
[1:20:48] Adam and Eve fell the same word that was
[1:20:51] once bringing hope is now bringing
[1:20:53] condemnation it was God coming up and
[1:20:56] saying Adam Adam Where Art Thou but now
[1:20:59] they're running from the presence of God
[1:21:01] God didn't change his word God didn't
[1:21:03] change his nature but because of
[1:21:06] condemnation it drove him away from
[1:21:08] certainty and oh my condemnation will do
[1:21:11] that it would drive you away from the
[1:21:13] power of this message it would drive you
[1:21:15] away from the authority of this word but
[1:21:18] I believe that once you've repent of
[1:21:20] your sins and of those addictions it's
[1:21:22] in the sea of God's forgetfulness that
[1:21:25] that channel can be opened right back up
[1:21:27] again but that's exactly what the devil
[1:21:29] likes to do is he tries everything he
[1:21:32] can do to destroy the certainty of God
[1:21:35] in his word because you you can look at
[1:21:37] job and look at the certainty of the
[1:21:39] word of God concerning job the Bible
[1:21:41] would say in Job 1 And1 and there was a
[1:21:44] man in the land of us whose name was job
[1:21:47] and that man was perfect and upright and
[1:21:49] one that fear God and it shoot evil then
[1:21:52] you come down to Job 1 and8 and the Lord
[1:21:55] said unto Satan hast thou considered my
[1:21:58] servant job that there was none like him
[1:22:00] in the earth a perfect and an upright
[1:22:02] man one that feareth God and asseth Evil
[1:22:05] I don't think that's a coincidence that
[1:22:07] the very same thoughts that God has of
[1:22:10] job job's manifesting it was the
[1:22:12] certainty of God's word it was the
[1:22:15] certainty coming to a vessel and
[1:22:17] manifesting the thoughts that God have D
[1:22:19] of job I believe before job was ever on
[1:22:22] the earth God already had those thoughts
[1:22:24] but you see that then there come an
[1:22:26] accuser that would come and try to
[1:22:28] destroy the certainty of job and because
[1:22:31] of the accuser he would lose his
[1:22:33] children he would lose his livestock he
[1:22:36] would lose his servants and then what
[1:22:38] did the accuser do next he would turn
[1:22:40] his wife against him and what I think is
[1:22:42] so incredible is that the devil can
[1:22:44] anoint anybody to try to destroy your
[1:22:47] certainty they may not mean to they
[1:22:49] might be in a bad mood or be wake up on
[1:22:51] the wrong side of the bed but the the
[1:22:53] Accuser what can anoint anybody to
[1:22:56] destroy the certainty cuz you know the
[1:22:58] Bible would say that job looked to his
[1:23:00] wife and would say you speak like a
[1:23:02] foolish woman and brother Brandon would
[1:23:04] say he didn't call her a foolish woman
[1:23:06] she said she spoke like a foolish woman
[1:23:09] so in other words she wasn't foolish on
[1:23:12] the inside but what she was speaking was
[1:23:14] anointed by something else oh my so
[1:23:17] loved ones can sometimes become anointed
[1:23:20] to try to destroy and bring down your
[1:23:23] certainty but don't turn against them
[1:23:26] don't become bitter to say hey let your
[1:23:28] heart say they're speaking like a
[1:23:30] foolish person but God still has
[1:23:32] something on the inside because you know
[1:23:34] what the devil was trying to do was get
[1:23:37] him to second guess his atonement cuz
[1:23:40] what did what did his friends come and
[1:23:41] say you're a secret sinner you've done
[1:23:43] this God is against you you're doing
[1:23:45] this and you're doing that what was they
[1:23:47] doing they was trying to get him to
[1:23:49] second guess his atonement and something
[1:23:52] that really struck me is that said if he
[1:23:54] started the second guess his own
[1:23:57] atonement what about his children cuz
[1:23:59] the Bible would say in job 1:4 and as
[1:24:01] job's went and his sons went and feasted
[1:24:04] in their houses everyone his day and
[1:24:07] sent and called for three sisters to eat
[1:24:09] and drink with him and it was so and
[1:24:12] when the day of their feasting were were
[1:24:14] about gone about then job and job sent
[1:24:17] and S Sanctified them rose up early in
[1:24:20] the morning offered burnt offerings
[1:24:22] according to the number of them
[1:24:24] for job said it might be that my sins
[1:24:27] have my my sons have sinned and cursed
[1:24:29] God in their hearts thus job did job
[1:24:32] continually and that dist struck me that
[1:24:35] if the accuser could get him the second
[1:24:38] guest his own atonement where would his
[1:24:40] faith be for his children and I think my
[1:24:42] that's exactly why the accuser comes
[1:24:45] against parents comes against your mind
[1:24:47] comes against your families because he
[1:24:49] knows if he can get you to second guess
[1:24:52] this message what's left for your
[1:24:53] children if he can get youed doubt this
[1:24:56] message what's left for his children but
[1:24:58] I believe what the Bible would say in
[1:25:00] job 1:22 in all of this job sin not nor
[1:25:04] charge God foolishly and all that he
[1:25:07] went through all of the accusations all
[1:25:10] of that that the accuser was putting
[1:25:12] upon him he still stood with the
[1:25:14] testimony that he he did not lose his
[1:25:18] certainty and I believe we can do that
[1:25:20] today as parents might go through mind
[1:25:22] battles we might go through hard times
[1:25:24] that the Deacon might go through hard
[1:25:25] times or Pastor might go through hard
[1:25:28] times but we can still stand with the
[1:25:30] certainty though God slay me yet I will
[1:25:34] trust him the lord taketh the lord
[1:25:36] giveth and the lord taketh away but
[1:25:38] Blessed Be Thy holy name in the midst of
[1:25:41] the accuser we don't have to lose our
[1:25:44] certainty the Apostle Paul would say but
[1:25:47] none of these things move me none of
[1:25:49] these things move me off of my certainty
[1:25:52] and I believe we can still stand with
[1:25:54] the certainty and my opening scripture
[1:25:56] is talking about Shadrach MCH and abedo
[1:25:59] they was accused and the Bible would say
[1:26:02] that the accuser were come and accused
[1:26:04] these certain Jews and it was because
[1:26:07] they wasn't bending to the pressure and
[1:26:09] the accuser would then throw them into
[1:26:11] the fire because they wasn't bending and
[1:26:14] oh my the accuser didn't go to the ones
[1:26:16] that was bowing he didn't go to the ones
[1:26:18] that were bending but he went to the
[1:26:20] ones that were certain and oh my if the
[1:26:22] devil's coming against you and the
[1:26:24] accusers is coming against you it's
[1:26:26] because he hasn't got you yet but you
[1:26:28] notice what happened after this the
[1:26:30] Bible would say that in the midst of the
[1:26:33] fire then there would come the Fourth
[1:26:35] Man and that what is so lovely about
[1:26:37] that story is right there in the midst
[1:26:39] of the accusation it was the accusation
[1:26:42] that bound them it was the accusation
[1:26:44] that threw them in the fire but then
[1:26:46] Nebuchadnezzar would look down and say
[1:26:48] didn't we throw three men bound into the
[1:26:51] fire but then he said below there's four
[1:26:54] men loosed walking in the midst of the
[1:26:57] fire what changed it the unveiling of
[1:27:00] God coming in the midst would break the
[1:27:03] accusation that would bind them that
[1:27:05] they could go free oh in little church
[1:27:07] we might get past we make a mistakes but
[1:27:10] he has come in the midst the Fourth Man
[1:27:13] In The Fire to break the accusation over
[1:27:16] our life that we can stand with the
[1:27:19] confidence oh he has come in the midst
[1:27:22] the Bible will tell us that Daniel that
[1:27:24] the accuser would accuse Daniel and that
[1:27:27] was the reason Daniel was in the Lion's
[1:27:29] Den was because the accuser would accuse
[1:27:32] him but then the Bible would say in
[1:27:33] Daniel 6 and 22 my God has sent this
[1:27:37] Angel and has shut the lion's mouth that
[1:27:39] they have not hurt me for as much as
[1:27:41] before him innocence was found in me and
[1:27:46] so there in the midst of the accusation
[1:27:49] he was found innocent I hope you're
[1:27:51] hearing me tonight in the midst of the
[1:27:53] ACC accusation there comes somebody in
[1:27:56] the midst because the Bible says before
[1:27:58] him there I stood innocent before him
[1:28:02] the one in the midst the accusation
[1:28:05] could not stand oh my in the midst of
[1:28:08] the unveiling of God in the midst of God
[1:28:10] coming in your presence that destroys
[1:28:13] the accusation of sins in the past it
[1:28:16] destroys the accusations of addictions
[1:28:19] that once held your life so that you can
[1:28:21] come back in the certainty of the the
[1:28:24] gospel and come with boldness oh the
[1:28:27] Bible would say that he cast down the
[1:28:29] accuser that that accused the brethen
[1:28:32] day and night the accuser was cast down
[1:28:34] but then the Bible would say they
[1:28:36] overcome him by the blood of the lamb
[1:28:38] and by the word of their testimony their
[1:28:41] testimony was greater than the
[1:28:43] accusation and you know something that
[1:28:45] just struck me that the testimony of
[1:28:47] what God is doing for you is greater
[1:28:49] than your past it don't matter what the
[1:28:51] devil may have done through your body
[1:28:53] what God is doing today is greater than
[1:28:56] the accusation that the devil's trying
[1:28:58] to use to bring down your
[1:29:01] certainty Hallelujah that's good he cast
[1:29:05] down the accuser but you still had
[1:29:07] overcome
[1:29:08] him you still got to battle that accuser
[1:29:11] even though he's cast down you got to
[1:29:13] battle him but how are you B how are you
[1:29:15] overcoming him how do I overcome him
[1:29:17] brother Josh the blood of the lamb and
[1:29:19] by the word of their testimony before
[1:29:21] him is found innocency the Bible would
[1:29:24] talk about would talk about the woman
[1:29:26] that was caught in the in the act of
[1:29:28] adultery and what what what what and
[1:29:31] these things have been just standing out
[1:29:32] to me as I as I've been studying on
[1:29:34] these things that the Bible would say
[1:29:37] that they would throw this woman at the
[1:29:39] feet of Jesus that they might accuse him
[1:29:42] and if you just look up that word accuse
[1:29:44] or accus there's there's a lot of these
[1:29:45] things that they threw this woman at the
[1:29:48] feet of Jesus that they might accuse him
[1:29:51] but there was perfect there was nothing
[1:29:53] to ACC acced but then what happened he
[1:29:55] didn't want this Perfection just staying
[1:29:58] with him and the Bible would say he
[1:30:00] would start to ride in the sand he will
[1:30:02] look up and the Bible says he stood
[1:30:03] alone in the midst of the woman in the
[1:30:07] midst and in the midst of the woman he
[1:30:09] would turn around and say woman where
[1:30:11] were thine accusers but in the midst of
[1:30:14] deity the accusers had no accusation and
[1:30:17] she would say Lord I have none neither
[1:30:19] do I accuse you and so this perfect
[1:30:22] state that he had he were now bestowed
[1:30:26] to a fallen
[1:30:27] Humanity Humanity with flaws Humanity
[1:30:31] that was caught in the midst of adultery
[1:30:33] Humanity that had a pass but in the
[1:30:36] midst he could bestow a forgiveness that
[1:30:40] would break the accusation oh little
[1:30:42] church and in the midst God Has Come God
[1:30:45] has come in our midst that he could
[1:30:47] break the accusation that we can stand
[1:30:50] before him
[1:30:51] blameless the Bible would say in Joel
[1:30:54] 226 and you shall eat in plenty and be
[1:30:57] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:30:59] Lord your God that he had dealt
[1:31:01] wondrously with you my people shall
[1:31:03] never be ashamed never be ashamed the
[1:31:06] next verse and she and you shall know
[1:31:08] that I am in the midst of Israel and
[1:31:11] that I am the Lord your God none else
[1:31:14] and my people shall never be ashamed I
[1:31:17] don't think it's coincidence that he
[1:31:19] says it twice that my people should
[1:31:21] never be ashamed but the accusers been
[1:31:23] cast pass down and I have come in the
[1:31:25] midst and since I am in the midst the
[1:31:29] accuser has no accusation since he's D
[1:31:32] wondrously with us we don't have to be
[1:31:34] ashamed oh Hallelujah we don't have to
[1:31:37] be ashamed of our past we don't have to
[1:31:39] be ashame and I I read this I think a
[1:31:42] couple sermons ago brother Brandon would
[1:31:43] saying think of it not one believer of
[1:31:46] any age needs to cry in his heart oh
[1:31:48] that I might have been back there in the
[1:31:49] first age when the when the apostles
[1:31:52] were first sent out there was no need to
[1:31:54] look back look up Behold Him who is even
[1:31:57] now walking in the midst of the churches
[1:32:00] through all ages Behold Him who is the
[1:32:02] same yesterday today and forever who
[1:32:05] never changes either in essence or in
[1:32:07] his ways where two or three are gathered
[1:32:10] together in his name there he is in
[1:32:12] their midst and not only in their midst
[1:32:15] as a complacent onlooker or as a
[1:32:17] recording Angel but there he stands
[1:32:19] expressing exactly what he is Oh Glory
[1:32:23] there he stands expressing exactly what
[1:32:26] he is but you got to Behold Him He says
[1:32:28] don't look back and wish we was there in
[1:32:30] the first church age when the apostles
[1:32:32] were sent out but he says Behold Him Now
[1:32:35] even present tense walking in the midst
[1:32:38] walking in the middle not not on the
[1:32:40] side not on the front not on the back
[1:32:42] but right in the midst and brother
[1:32:44] Brandon would say not as a complacent
[1:32:45] onlooker or recording Angel but he
[1:32:48] stands expressing exactly what he is let
[1:32:52] our musicians come tonight
[1:32:54] he has come in the
[1:32:59] midst brother Brandon would talk
[1:33:02] about uh the woman out the well and this
[1:33:05] is just so amazing he says no what did
[1:33:07] this putting the old scripture with that
[1:33:09] with the experience Jesus was given to
[1:33:12] her what did it do and made the Messiah
[1:33:14] and did you notice quickly her sins were
[1:33:17] forgiven because at the beginning she
[1:33:20] was redeemable because she was in God's
[1:33:23] thinking now at the beginning so it
[1:33:25] redeemed her or brought her back when
[1:33:27] she seen the express scripture
[1:33:29] manifested what he was what he is so
[1:33:33] when she seen God unveiling himself that
[1:33:36] would redeem her back to the thoughts
[1:33:38] God had for her and oh my here she was
[1:33:41] with five husbands the one she was with
[1:33:43] now wasn't even hers but she was
[1:33:45] redeemable and whenever she would see
[1:33:48] God unveiled then that would open up a
[1:33:50] channel to the mind of God and then here
[1:33:52] would come the thoughts a perfect image
[1:33:55] that God had of her life then would come
[1:33:58] inside of a vessel and manifest that
[1:34:01] Perfect Image oh my even though she was
[1:34:04] condemned by her past condemned by
[1:34:06] things she was doing brother brandom
[1:34:09] says and he se you a human being like
[1:34:10] you are and though there come millions
[1:34:13] of years yet there's nothing that can
[1:34:15] keep you from coming back to the perfect
[1:34:18] image that God ordained for you in the
[1:34:21] beginning oh my he's in the mid
[1:34:25] breaking the back of the
[1:34:27] accuser breaking the back of the accuser
[1:34:30] and brother brandham he preaches on
[1:34:32] Easter and it says when he rose e Easter
[1:34:34] morning he broke the back of the devil
[1:34:36] and he says Easter means to bring
[1:34:39] back and he says because the Bible says
[1:34:42] because I live ye shall live also so
[1:34:45] Easter's a proclamation that the image
[1:34:48] that God had of your mind of you and his
[1:34:50] mind Easter brings you back to that
[1:34:52] image of perfection brother brandom says
[1:34:56] Easter proved he wasn't only the word
[1:34:58] but he was God himself the D Dynamics in
[1:35:00] the word that made the body of Jesus
[1:35:03] coat stiff dead in the grave shaken the
[1:35:05] life rise again and roll away the stone
[1:35:09] and he would say this she is flesh of
[1:35:11] his flesh bone of his bone life of his
[1:35:13] life power of his power she is him as as
[1:35:16] men and women are one the woman taken
[1:35:18] from his side she taken a spirit the
[1:35:21] feminine Spirit from him the flesh from
[1:35:23] his side May both the mechanics and
[1:35:25] Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and
[1:35:28] the Flesh of him put it together made
[1:35:30] Dynam made mechanics and Dynamics he
[1:35:34] says Easter made the body of Jesus that
[1:35:37] was dead stiff cold shaken the life and
[1:35:40] rise again and so has this this bride
[1:35:42] coming of Christ that was dead stiff and
[1:35:45] cold but this second Easter has pulled
[1:35:47] her out brother the brandom said what an
[1:35:49] Easter that was what an Easter this is

[1:41:31] you it's it's God's presence in
[1:41:35] you that's just such an incredible thing
[1:41:39] it was it was the god of Heaven wanting
[1:41:41] to become a
[1:41:43] man so that he could know what you felt
[1:41:48] like but also so that you could know
[1:41:51] what he felt like
[1:41:54] that's
[1:41:56] deity that really struck
[1:41:59] me he he don't want you to see him as a
[1:42:03] Creed a
[1:42:05] tradition a
[1:42:07] law he wants to see you as a very living
[1:42:12] loving
[1:42:14] father that loves
[1:42:17] you what a what an incredible thought
[1:42:22] that was tonight
[1:42:24] oh how I love
[1:42:28] him I guess everyone's preaching Easter
[1:42:33] messages around the
[1:42:39] country but to know that he lives in me
[1:42:42] brother Ken as he shook my hand this
[1:42:45] morning at the
[1:42:46] door man he says Christ Jesus
[1:42:51] lives he lives My Savior Lives something
[1:42:55] like
[1:42:56] that and
[1:43:00] um he telling me his testimony this
[1:43:03] morning and said he was he was um uh
[1:43:06] there at the the back and his his eye
[1:43:09] was you know he was seeing different
[1:43:11] colors and when he'd look around just
[1:43:12] the colors and it and it brought fear in
[1:43:15] his eye fear in his heart because he had
[1:43:18] had that retina detached before and he
[1:43:20] knows what all those colors mean and
[1:43:22] knows it and it bothered him
[1:43:25] and and then about the same time brother
[1:43:28] murl was saying that he was going he
[1:43:31] wanted to sing another song the song
[1:43:33] that he sung tonight and he says but I
[1:43:35] just feel that I I need to sing we just
[1:43:38] need to sing Amazing
[1:43:39] Grace well well brother Ken was saying
[1:43:44] as as he begin to sing Amazing Grace and
[1:43:46] just put his confidence in the Lord and
[1:43:48] just letting God know how much he loved
[1:43:51] him he said then the Lord just come in
[1:43:53] and just totally heal that all of that
[1:43:56] left
[1:43:57] Hallelujah that's
[1:44:02] a he lives he lives Christ Jesus lives
[1:44:07] today walks with me he talks with me all
[1:44:11] along life's narrow way aren't you glad
[1:44:14] that he know that you know that he lives
[1:44:17] that he wants to Oh my he he he wants to
[1:44:24] walk with you man and so I I appreciated
[1:44:29] that testimony and I I just thought it
[1:44:31] was so unique because brother Merl was
[1:44:33] going to sing a totally different song
[1:44:34] and then the Lord put something on his
[1:44:36] heart so so to see do do you see how
[1:44:39] deity is Among Us and how that we it's
[1:44:42] so important for us to just really be
[1:44:44] sensitive to the Lord in those in those
[1:44:47] times and so we say a big win for God

[1:49:38] Caleb and I know there's some women here
[1:49:40] in the building that really do miss them
[1:49:43] and uh a whole bunch and and um um what
[1:49:47] had happened was uh they they just
[1:49:49] needed they didn't have enough
[1:49:51] counselors there in Louisiana
[1:49:53] and um so they put out a memo uh uh
[1:49:57] saying listen we're in trouble we can't
[1:49:59] have we can't have Youth Camp here in a
[1:50:01] couple of days if we can't find
[1:50:03] counselors and um and so uh all four of
[1:50:07] the boys uh volunteered just right away
[1:50:11] said they would go down there Josh was
[1:50:13] going to go and um and and um and Fresco
[1:50:19] was going to ride down there with the
[1:50:20] boys and Josh and Loretta was going to
[1:50:22] meet them
[1:50:23] they in Louisiana and then Fresco was
[1:50:25] going to ride back with Loretta because
[1:50:28] there was no place for Loretta to stay
[1:50:29] over there and um and so I felt that I
[1:50:34] when the
[1:50:35] funeral thing came up I I felt that
[1:50:38] Fresca needed to be with us over there
[1:50:40] in Arkansas and so um so Josh and
[1:50:44] Loretta just came straight on this way
[1:50:46] here and and um I believe the Lord just
[1:50:49] worked it all out in that way and so uh

[1:50:54] message tonight like that if uh or that
[1:50:56] good message anyways amen the Lord just
[1:50:59] ordained that and so we're so thankful
