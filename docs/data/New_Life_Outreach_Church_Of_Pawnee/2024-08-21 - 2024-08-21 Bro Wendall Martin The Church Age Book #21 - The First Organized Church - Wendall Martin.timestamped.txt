[11:34] sang before this that I'm going to
[11:37] praise him in the storm amen I'd like to
[11:39] go to prayer here tonight and ask
[11:41] brother Merl it is good to have him and
[11:43] sister Leah back with us tonight I sure
[11:45] missed him while they were
[11:47] gone definitely missed him Sunday
[11:49] morning song leading amen but I'm going
[11:52] to ask him if he would mind coming and
[11:54] leaded us in prayer we do have quite a
[11:57] few requests here tonight we got one
[12:00] for Sister Christine this is from Sister
[12:02] Carol says she still desires prayer
[12:06] she's at home and still tired she's on a
[12:09] soft food diet and they think there was
[12:11] some intestinal damage when her heart
[12:15] rate was so low so let's remember her
[12:17] then we have one from Aunt Angie says I
[12:19] have an unspoken request please say a
[12:21] prayer for me then we have one from
[12:24] Brother Austin he says I have a prayer
[12:26] request my girlfriend Rose is having
[12:28] problems with what she thinks is her
[12:31] thyroid she gets these moments where she
[12:33] can barely breathe so she went to the
[12:35] doctor and they drew blood but they
[12:38] didn't find anything her heart rate will
[12:41] Spike while she's just sitting there she
[12:44] says she's breathing but it's like
[12:45] there's no Oxygen we're not exactly sure
[12:48] what it is but we would appreciate the
[12:50] prayers I believe Mary was healed of
[12:53] that something of that when her she
[12:55] would her heart rate would just
[12:56] completely Spike like she felt like she
[12:59] would pass out and so we know if the
[13:02] Lord can heal my wife then he can
[13:04] definitely heal Sister Rose amen and
[13:07] also we have a a small update from
[13:10] Sister Denise she says my blood pressure
[13:13] is still giving me problems it is 170
[13:16] over 110 they're going to move me to ICU
[13:19] sometime today so let's remember that I
[13:21] mean I know it's been said many times my
[13:24] goodness my mom struggled with high
[13:26] blood pressure and if the Lord can heal
[13:28] her I've I've battled high blood
[13:30] pressure if the Lord can heal me then
[13:32] he's no respector of person here tonight
[13:34] amen dad put out this quote hope you
[13:36] don't mind me reading it but he put out
[13:39] this quote and I thought it really
[13:40] powerful he says and the only thing you
[13:41] have to do now he says you're a free
[13:44] moral agent but you can accept it if you
[13:47] want it but kick it out if Eve hadn't
[13:50] stopped that moment to listen don't stop
[13:52] for nothing don't
[13:53] stop when Elijah took a haa he said take
[13:57] my staff go lay it on the dead baby and
[13:59] if any man even speaks to you don't
[14:02] speak back if he tries to stop you just
[14:04] keep going look at this woman when she
[14:07] called her servant she said saddle a
[14:08] mule and go forward and don't you even
[14:11] stop till I bid you that's it when you
[14:14] got the message keep going amen say I

[14:41] many warriors do we have here tonight
[14:43] that we're not going to give in or bow

[29:53] we also want to hear from you and I'm
[29:56] asking Lord that you would spend the
[29:58] send the spirit of Revelation to us and
[30:01] that your blessings would be upon your
[30:03] word and as we read the Church hbook
[30:06] Father we give ourselves to you and Lord
[30:09] you see sister Denise Lord that's that's
[30:13] struggling in the hospital you see the
[30:16] all the these different needs that's
[30:17] already been brought before you we're
[30:19] just asking Lord that you would be with
[30:21] every one of them and father we'll give
[30:23] you glory and honor in Jesus name we
[30:26] pray can the church say
[30:28] amen and amen God bless you you can be
[30:32] seated here
[30:33] tonight and
[30:35] um so uh we are going
[30:39] to uh start this evening in uh on page
[30:44] 188 now last week we we talked about the
[30:49] um about the three gods and um how that
[30:53] it is Pagan
[30:55] worship and um and how that the Trinity
[30:59] did not start with the
[31:02] Bible and so uh the Bible is not the
[31:06] originator of worshiping three gods and
[31:10] um in fact the Bible says hero Israel
[31:15] the Lord our God is one Lord he is one
[31:18] one alone so but tonight we're going to
[31:21] be reading and um and so we're going to
[31:25] find where the first organized Church
[31:27] came from from so um uh we're going to
[31:31] start getting in a little bit of the the
[31:32] meat of the of of what the church ages
[31:35] is about and um and so we can understand
[31:40] that the first church age was there was
[31:43] an
[31:44] anointing uh the power of God it was God
[31:48] living in bodies and it was many bodies
[31:52] that made up one body so the Apostle
[31:56] Paul would say many me MERS but one body
[32:00] so just as your
[32:01] body uh I don't know how many how many
[32:04] parts do they say that we have how many
[32:06] bones I the human body has um we got a
[32:09] lot of parts but
[32:12] together we make up one body and so it
[32:16] has been uh in in each of the church
[32:20] church ages amen we have the group of us
[32:23] that is right here tonight we're a we're
[32:26] there's many bodies here here then
[32:28] there's bodies in Claremore there's
[32:29] bodies in brother Sams there's bodies
[32:32] you know uh amarel and and so these
[32:35] these bodies amen all make up they we're
[32:39] called members each one of us are all
[32:41] members of one body
[32:44] so then we've got the church ages and so
[32:49] um the church ages is is divided up into
[32:52] seven sections seven seven periods and
[32:56] so these periods of time
[32:58] are is is specific things that God is
[33:01] wanting us to look at to see these are
[33:04] prophecies that are coming to pass and
[33:07] so what we are seeing what we're going
[33:09] to start reading tonight is we're going
[33:11] to find that God
[33:15] fora predicted and told uh when that
[33:20] that the Catholic church was going to
[33:22] come and these other denominational
[33:24] systems were going to come and we're
[33:25] going to find that it was Satan
[33:28] behind it so this is you got to get your
[33:32] thinking caps on your Revelation caps
[33:34] because we we can understand that God is
[33:37] not interested in churches he's
[33:40] interested in people the churches are
[33:44] going to as we're going to read tonight
[33:47] going to fall away their doctrines are
[33:49] going to be off but God loves his elect
[33:53] and so um so we're going to be in the
[33:56] third period this is that we're in the
[33:59] uh panian Church age and so we we've
[34:02] we've talked about how it started in in
[34:04] the book of Acts uh they're on the day
[34:06] of Pentecost and it's just slowly been
[34:08] waning away and so um we want to start
[34:13] here and finish off last week's uh
[34:16] they're on page 188 we're going to start
[34:18] here at the at the second
[34:21] paragraph it says Not only was ancestor
[34:25] worship uh originated in Babylon but so
[34:29] also was worship of nature it was in
[34:32] Babylon the
[34:33] Gods uh were identified with the sun and
[34:36] moon Etc the chief object in nature was
[34:40] the sun which has liiving and Heat
[34:43] giving properties and appears to man as
[34:46] a ball of fire in the heavens thus the
[34:49] chief God would be the sun god whom they
[34:52] called Baal often the sun was depicted
[34:55] as a circle of flame and soon uh around
[34:58] that flame there appeared a serpent and
[35:01] it wasn't long until the serpent become
[35:04] the symbol of the Sun and consequently
[35:07] worship thus the desire of Satan's heart
[35:09] became full-fledged he was worshiped as
[35:12] God his throne was established his
[35:14] slaves bowed to him and there there in
[35:17] pergamus in the form of a living serpent
[35:19] he was worshiped the tree of the
[35:22] knowledge of Good and Evil now
[35:24] symbolized in the form of a living
[35:26] serpent had not only seduced Eve but the
[35:29] majority of
[35:30] mankind how did pergamus become the seat
[35:33] of Satan if Babylon was the seat and now
[35:36] we went through Babylon last week
[35:38] remember it says the answer again is in
[35:41] history when Babylon fell to the mes and
[35:44] Persians the priest king adelus left the
[35:48] c or fled the city and went to pergamus
[35:50] with his priest and sacred Mysteries
[35:53] there he set up his kingdom outside the
[35:55] Roman Empire and thrived under the care
[35:58] of the devil this has uh been a very
[36:01] short resume of the history of the
[36:04] babylonish religion and its event to
[36:07] pergamus many questions are are no doubt
[36:09] left unanswered and much more no doubt
[36:12] could have been said to Enlighten us but
[36:15] this is not in uh is not intended to be
[36:18] a study of history rather it is intended
[36:21] to be a help to understand or to study
[36:24] the
[36:25] word the denunciation Revelations
[36:28] 2:14 through 15 but I have a few things
[36:32] against thee because thou Hast there
[36:35] them that hold the doctrine of balum who
[36:37] taught Balo to cast a stumbling block
[36:39] before the children of Israel to eat
[36:41] things sacrificed unto idols and to
[36:43] commit fornication so hast thou also
[36:46] them that hold the doctrine of the
[36:48] nicians which thing I hate in this
[36:51] panian church age the Lord denounces two
[36:55] doctrines which he hates number one
[36:58] the doctrine of balum which was uh which
[37:01] brought idolatry and sinful excesses to
[37:04] Israel at B pror number two the doctrine
[37:08] of the nicians which had been but deeds
[37:11] in the Ephesian age combine this
[37:14] denouncement with the fact that he has
[37:16] been emphasizing per pergamus as the
[37:19] seed of Satan and it is very easy and
[37:22] proper to conclude that somehow the
[37:24] religion of Babylon has been
[37:26] intermingled with with
[37:28] Christianity now this is not merely an
[37:30] assumption but an a historical fact
[37:33] which we will prove by going back into
[37:36] history to about 36 ad and coming up to
[37:39] the nin Council of 325 when the
[37:41] Christians mainly Jews by birth were
[37:43] scattered abroad from Jerusalem they
[37:45] went everywhere preaching the gospel
[37:47] particularly in the
[37:49] synagogues thus within 3 years or about
[37:52] uh or about in 36 ad the gospel had been
[37:56] taken to Rome by Junius and
[38:01] Andrus uh andronicus or whatever who
[38:05] according to uh uh Romans 16 and 7 were
[38:09] Apostles they the work flourished there
[38:12] for several years until the constant
[38:15] altercations of the Jews amongst
[38:17] themselves caused the emperor Claudius
[38:19] to expel them from Rome with the Jews
[38:23] banished uh from that City the backbone
[38:25] of that little church was practically
[38:27] broken
[38:28] perhaps even the elders had been Jewish
[38:32] so would and and so would be gone the
[38:34] flock would be unattended and since the
[38:36] word had not been written as a guide it
[38:39] would be very easy for this little flock
[38:42] to drift and be unated by the or
[38:46] inundated by the philosophers and the
[38:47] pagans of the day with Grievious wolves
[38:50] on the prow the spirit of the Antichrist
[38:53] released we find from history that this
[38:56] little church in Rome became hopelessly
[38:59] backslidden and begin to introduce Pagan
[39:01] ceremonies under Christian
[39:03] titles as the period of banishment
[39:05] lasted for 13 years the founders Junius
[39:08] and and
[39:09] Andrus did not come back until 54 ad
[39:14] imagined their horror to find a church
[39:17] with a Christian title that was woefully
[39:20] Pagan there were altars in the church
[39:23] upon which they placed incense and
[39:25] celebrated Pagan rights the established
[39:27] leaders of that church could not be
[39:29] approached so with the few who had tried
[39:33] to remain faithful they started a new
[39:35] church or the second Church of Rome and
[39:37] God graciously worked among them by
[39:39] signs and wonders so that a third church
[39:41] was started and though the first church
[39:44] was reproached for being Pagan and not
[39:47] Christian in its worship it would not
[39:49] give up its title but remain Still
[39:52] Remains and Still Remains The First
[39:54] Church of Rome the Roman Catholic Church
[39:57] now the majority of us have the mistaken
[39:59] identity that any who called themselves
[40:02] Christians would be the target of the
[40:04] devil and consequently the brunt of
[40:07] governmental tyranny but that is not so
[40:11] the first church had begun to thrive and
[40:14] multiply so in numbers that the Emperors
[40:17] and various officials of the government
[40:19] actually favored that church for
[40:21] political reasons thus when the church
[40:24] when the leaders of the first church in
[40:26] Rome found themselves in favor they took
[40:28] the opportunity to turn the government
[40:30] against the True Believers and demand
[40:33] their persecution unless they come into
[40:35] their fold one such Bishop of the First
[40:39] Church of Rome was
[40:43] anaus who lived in the 2 century and was
[40:46] a contemporary with polycarp and when
[40:48] the venerable polycarp heard the First
[40:50] Christian Church of Rome was involved in
[40:53] Pagan ceremonies and had corrupted the
[40:55] truth of the Gospel he went there to
[40:57] implore them to change he saw them
[41:00] prostrate themselves before images and
[41:02] named after the apostles and Saints he
[41:04] saw them light candles and burn incense
[41:07] on altars on the altar he saw them
[41:10] celebrate the Passover under the name of
[41:12] Easter where they elevated the disc
[41:14] shaped bread that honored the son God
[41:17] and then they poured the wine out as a
[41:21] uh liation to the
[41:23] gods but this age Saint who had traveled
[41:26] 1500 miles could not arrest their
[41:29] downward plunge God spoke to him just as
[41:32] he was leaving Ephraim is married to his
[41:35] idols let him Al alone Hosea 4:15 and
[41:40] polycarp never more returned following
[41:43] anus an am I saying that right
[41:47] anicetus was the wick Wicked Bishop of
[41:49] Rome called Victor he introduced even
[41:52] more Pagan festivals and ceremonies into
[41:55] the first church and also went about
[41:57] about trying his utmost to persuade the
[41:59] true Christian Church to incorporate the
[42:01] same ideas they would not do so as he
[42:04] requested so he prevailed upon the
[42:06] government officials to persecute the
[42:09] Believers hailing them into court
[42:11] casting them into prison even meeting
[42:13] out death to many such an example of his
[42:16] vile Deeds is found in history where the
[42:19] emperor Septimus uh Severus was was
[42:23] prevailed upon by cestatus
[42:27] the vi the friend of Victor to kill
[42:30] 7,000 at thessalonica because these True
[42:34] Believers celebrated the Passover
[42:36] according to the Lord Jesus and not
[42:38] according to the worship of a
[42:40] started already the false Vine was
[42:43] turning loose its anger against the
[42:45] Living God by killing the elect even as
[42:48] did its
[42:49] forebear Cain killed Abel the true
[42:53] church kept trying to get the first
[42:54] church to repent it would not do so it
[42:58] increased in size and influence it
[43:00] embarked upon constant campaign to
[43:03] discredit the true seed they claimed
[43:06] that they and they alone were the true
[43:08] representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:09] and vaulted the fact that they were the
[43:11] original Church in Rome that they alone
[43:14] were the first church indeed they were
[43:17] the first church and indeed they are
[43:20] thus by the time that this third Church
[43:22] age of this third Church age we have two
[43:26] churches bearing the same name but with
[43:29] a bitter difference between them one has
[43:31] departed from the truth married idols
[43:34] and has no life in her she has
[43:36] hybridized herself and the signs of
[43:38] death and not life follow in her way she
[43:41] is powerful with many members she is
[43:43] favored by the world the other is a
[43:46] little persecuted group but she follows
[43:49] the word and the signs follow her the
[43:52] sick are healed the dead are raised she
[43:54] is alive with the life and word of God
[43:57] she loves not her life but holds to his
[43:59] name and his faith even unto
[44:02] death and so the terrible persecution of
[44:05] official Rome fell upon the True
[44:07] Believers until Constantine arose and
[44:10] granted freedom of religious worship
[44:13] there seemed to be two reasons why this
[44:14] Freedom was granted in the first place
[44:17] various good Emperors had uh had not
[44:20] allowed persecution but as they passed
[44:22] on they were followed by those who
[44:24] killed the Christians it was so
[44:26] senseless that it finally came to a
[44:28] public heed that the Christians ought to
[44:31] be left alone the second and best noted
[44:34] reason is that Constantine had a very or
[44:36] had a difficult very difficult battle
[44:38] ahead of him in taking over control the
[44:42] control of the Empire One Night in a
[44:44] dream he saw a white cross appear before
[44:47] him he felt that this was an omen unto
[44:50] him and that if the Christians prayed
[44:52] for a victory for him he would win that
[44:54] battle he promised freedom for them in
[44:57] in the event that he was
[44:59] Victorious he was Victorious and the
[45:02] freedom of worship was granted in the
[45:04] Edict of nantis in in
[45:07] 312 ad but this freedom from persecution
[45:11] and death was not as magnimous as it
[45:14] first appeared Constantine was now the
[45:17] patron as a patron his interest was
[45:20] somewhat more than of an
[45:23] zerber for he decided that the church
[45:25] needed his help in her aairs he had seen
[45:28] them disagreeing over various matters
[45:30] one of which involved Aras the bishop of
[45:33] Alexander who taught his adherence that
[45:35] Jesus was not truly God but a lesser
[45:38] being having been created by God the
[45:42] western church held the opposite view
[45:44] believing that Jesus was the very
[45:46] essence of God and as they said co-equal
[45:48] with the father with with such matters
[45:52] along with the intrusion of the Pagan
[45:54] ceremony and worship the emperor called
[45:56] for the n Council in
[45:58] 3:25 with the thought that he would
[46:00] bring all groups together where they
[46:03] could iron out their differences and
[46:05] come to a common understanding and all
[46:08] would be one isn't it peculiar that
[46:11] though this started with Constantine it
[46:13] didn't die but as very much alive today
[46:15] as the World Council of churches where
[46:18] he failed to truly achieve it it will be
[46:21] achieved in this day through the
[46:23] economical ecumenical move now this
[46:26] interference of the state with the
[46:28] church is a foolish thing for the world
[46:31] does not understand either the truth
[46:33] found in the word or the ways of the
[46:36] church why the very decision handed down
[46:38] by the Council of Aras was uh that Aras
[46:42] was wrong was reversed two years later
[46:44] by the emperor and for many years that
[46:46] false Doctrine was voed upon the
[46:50] people but that church and state would
[46:54] come together was truly forn of the Lord
[46:57] for the very name pergamus means
[46:59] thoroughly married isn't that something
[47:02] indeed State and church were married
[47:05] politics and religion were United The
[47:08] Offspring of the Union have been
[47:11] consistently uh with the most hor
[47:14] horrible hybrids the world has ever seen
[47:17] the truth is not in them but all the
[47:20] ways all the evil ways of Cain the first
[47:23] hybrid Is Not only was the State and
[47:27] church wedded in this age but the
[47:29] Babylonian religion was officially
[47:32] joined to the first church Satan now had
[47:36] access to the name of Christ and he was
[47:39] enthroned as God In Worship with the
[47:42] help of the federal aid the churches
[47:44] fell air to beautiful buildings which
[47:47] were lined with halters of white marble
[47:50] and images of The Departed Saints and
[47:53] and right in this age is when the Beast
[47:57] of Revelations 13:3 that was wounded to
[48:00] death the Pagan Roman Empire came back
[48:02] to life and the power of the Holy Roman
[48:05] as the power of the Holy Roman
[48:08] Empire Rome as a material Nation had
[48:11] suffered much depletion and soon would
[48:13] suffer it completely it but it mattered
[48:16] not now for her religious Empire would
[48:19] keep her on top of the world governing
[48:22] from inside where she would not appear
[48:24] to do so from the outside let me show
[48:26] you the the exact scriptural truth of
[48:29] this matter for I do not want anyone to
[48:31] think that I'm giving a revelation of my
[48:34] own one not found in scripture but
[48:37] Daniel 2
[48:40] 31-45 thou O King sawest and behold a
[48:44] great image this great image whose
[48:46] brightness was excellent and stood
[48:48] before thee and the form thereof was
[48:52] terrible this image's head was a fine
[48:55] gold and his breast and his arms of
[48:57] silver his belly and his thighs of brass
[49:01] his legs of iron his feet part of iron
[49:04] and part of clay thou sawest till a
[49:07] stone was cut out without hands which
[49:10] smok the image upon his feet that were
[49:14] of iron and clay and break them to
[49:17] Pieces then was the iron the clay the
[49:20] brass the silver the gold broken into
[49:22] pieces together and became like the
[49:24] chaff of the summer threshing floor and
[49:27] the wind carried them away that no place
[49:29] was found for them and the stone that
[49:31] smoke the image become a great mountain
[49:34] and filled the whole earth this is the
[49:37] dream and we will tell thee the
[49:38] interpretation
[49:40] thereof before the king thou Old King
[49:43] are a king of kings for the Lord God
[49:47] hath given thee a
[49:50] kingdom power and strength and glory and
[49:54] wheresoever the children of of men dwell
[49:57] the Beast of the field and the fowls of
[49:59] the heaven hath he given into thine hand
[50:03] and hath made thee ruler over them all
[50:06] thou art this head of gold and after
[50:09] thee there shall rise another kingdom
[50:11] inferior to thee and another third
[50:14] Kingdom of brass which shall rule over
[50:16] all the earth and the fourth Kingdom
[50:19] shall be strong as iron for as much as
[50:22] iron
[50:26] ir and and as iron that
[50:28] breakthe shall it break in pieces and
[50:31] bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet
[50:33] and Toes part of The Potter's clay and
[50:36] part of the iron a part of iron the the
[50:39] kingdom shall be divided and there shall
[50:42] be in it of the strength of the iron for
[50:44] as much as thou sawest the iron mixed
[50:47] with the Mary clay and as the toes of
[50:50] the feet were part iron and part clay so
[50:53] the kingdom shall be partly strong and
[50:55] partly broken whereas thou sawest iron
[50:58] mixed with myy Clay they shall mingle
[51:01] themselves with the seed of men and they
[51:03] shall not cleave one to another even as
[51:07] iron is not mixed with
[51:08] clay and in the days of these Kings
[51:11] shall the god of Heaven set up a
[51:13] kingdom which shall never be destroyed
[51:17] and the kingdom shall not be left to
[51:19] other people but it shall break in
[51:21] pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[51:24] and it shall stand forever for as much
[51:27] as thou sawest the stone was cut out of
[51:29] the mountain without hands and that it
[51:32] break in pieces the iron the brass the
[51:34] clay the silver and the gold the great
[51:37] God hath made known to the king what
[51:40] shall come to pass Hereafter and the
[51:42] dream is certain and the interpretation
[51:44] thereof is sure here in is revealed an
[51:47] an exact account of the future unpar
[51:50] unfulfilled history that was prophesied
[51:53] to come upon the Earth from the time of
[51:56] Daniel until Jesus would come and reign
[51:59] as the son of David it is known as the
[52:02] time of the
[52:03] Gentiles it had within it four
[52:06] historical divisions which were known by
[52:09] the den the the dominating Empire in
[52:11] each division Babylonian middle Persian
[52:15] Grecian and Roman the greatest and
[52:19] absolute uh
[52:21] monarchy was the babylonius which was
[52:25] typified as the head of G
[52:27] the next in the glory was the meadow
[52:30] Persian which is history bore out that
[52:33] was truly less glorious and was typified
[52:36] as breast and arms of silver then there
[52:39] followed the Grecian age whose uh King
[52:43] was the most brilliant of all military
[52:45] leaders the world had ever known and so
[52:48] it was fittingly typified as the belly
[52:51] and thighs of brass it was less glorious
[52:54] than the other two preceding it
[52:57] and finally the last kingdom was the
[53:00] Roman Empire typified in as the legs and
[53:03] feet wherein the former kingdoms were
[53:06] typified as pure Metals pure gold pure
[53:09] silver brass the last empire was pure
[53:13] iron only in the legs and when it came
[53:16] to the feet it was a mixture of iron and
[53:19] clay and mineral and soil just don't mix
[53:24] and produce consistency and strength but
[53:27] not only is this so but most amazingly
[53:30] the last empire which was the Roman
[53:33] would endure in its peculiar mixed state
[53:36] right up until Jesus returns the Roman
[53:40] Empire of iron iron signifies power
[53:43] great destructive force against
[53:45] opposition was made was to be made of
[53:48] two main divisions it was certainly and
[53:51] it certainly was for the Empire
[53:53] literally split in two the east and west
[53:56] both were very powerful crushing all
[53:59] before them but as the glory and power
[54:02] of all Empires fell so this Empire begin
[54:05] to fall also thus Rome fell Pagan
[54:10] Imperial Rome was no longer iron she
[54:13] crumbled she was wounded to
[54:16] death Rome could not now rule it was all
[54:20] over so thought the world but but wrong
[54:24] the world how wrong the world was for
[54:27] the head Rome though wounded was not
[54:30] wounded unto death the whis translation
[54:33] of Revelations 133 it reads one of these
[54:37] heads appeared to be mortally wounded
[54:39] the throat having been slashed and his
[54:42] death stroke was healed and the whole
[54:45] earth followed after the wild beast in
[54:50] amazement amen so how are we doing so
[54:52] far now are we are we catching now we so
[54:57] we're we're understanding that that
[54:59] through the the the Gentile history uh
[55:03] we we went from Babylon and then we we
[55:06] come down to uh uh the meal Persian then
[55:09] we come down to Greece then we come down
[55:11] to Rome now this was the world Empires
[55:14] that has come the last the last great
[55:18] world Empire was the Roman Empire and so
[55:23] so as we just read here that was that
[55:25] was uh when when Jesus was was uh born
[55:28] they were born under the Roman Empire
[55:31] and so uh that they they were the world
[55:33] leader now so it's it was showing that
[55:36] Rome was going to die just as these
[55:41] others that it would that it would die
[55:43] and that it would not have any effect
[55:46] anymore so the the Rome died years ago
[55:51] you know Greece Greece there's it's you
[55:53] know it's still there but it's not a
[55:54] world Empire Rome is not a world Empire
[55:57] anymore we've got you know now the
[55:58] United States would be considered the
[56:00] world leader um if you wanted to uh you
[56:04] know put it like that but we but
[56:08] Rome it when it looked like it was going
[56:11] to die the scripture predicted that it
[56:14] was going to rise back up again that
[56:17] it's its head was going to be healed and
[56:21] it was going to come back not as not not
[56:25] as the Roman Empire
[56:27] but now it would be the paple Rome not
[56:29] Pagan Rome but paple Rome it would come
[56:32] under the name of Christian and it would
[56:35] rule the world again Rome rules the
[56:41] world today through its
[56:44] religion Rome came up with the Trinity
[56:47] or uh introduced the Trinity put it in
[56:50] the in the Christian Church Rome is the
[56:53] first organized Church all all of these
[56:56] other denominations these these 30,000
[56:59] however many denominations there are
[57:01] they have all came out of Mama which is
[57:04] the Roman Catholic church so so we can
[57:08] we can what we're reading here is that
[57:11] this is the beginning this is when Rome
[57:14] the First Church of Rome the Catholic
[57:16] church was born this is where it came
[57:18] from and so the first church now and I
[57:22] you got to understand we got all of
[57:24] these denominations and they all look so
[57:26] good and every one of them baptize in in
[57:29] in the Catholic baptism right every
[57:33] denomination most every denomination I'd
[57:35] say 99% of them all baptized in in uh in
[57:39] the titles of the Catholic church so so
[57:42] we can we can see how that it has all
[57:44] become pretty today it's all been so
[57:46] mingled up today and it all just sort of
[57:48] looks we're just accepting of everybody
[57:51] but this is the birth of that church and
[57:54] they put they put
[57:57] 68 million Christians to death the Roman
[58:01] Catholic Church throughout its history
[58:03] put
[58:04] 68 million Christians to death for not
[58:10] adhering to its doctrines it was trying
[58:13] to force what happened as he is talking
[58:15] about the marriage between the church
[58:18] and the state is the Roman Church they
[58:21] had they had made it so beautiful and
[58:23] the pagans so much that they started
[58:25] attracting all of these Kings and they
[58:27] all just came in and and and uh become
[58:30] very wealthy people and and so the these
[58:34] Kings would be given Promises of of of
[58:36] eternal life and be given Promises of
[58:38] all of these things and the protection
[58:40] of the Catholic church if they would
[58:42] allow the church uh to take over and
[58:44] become the this the state religion so
[58:47] this is how they ruled they ruled for
[58:50] almost a millennium they ruled for
[58:52] almost a thousand years over all of the
[58:55] Earth and they did not have a country of
[58:58] their own they simply used Kings as pwns
[59:02] so that their religion would would be
[59:05] the only religion allowed and they would
[59:08] kill you put you to death this is the
[59:11] Catholic church folks this is the
[59:13] Christian this is this is the Pagan
[59:15] Christian church and and so it ruled the
[59:18] world for a thousand almost a thousand
[59:21] years before uh uh before Martin Luther
[59:26] came in so so this is the beginning this
[59:28] is the empy this is where this is where
[59:30] the church is being that church is being
[59:32] established are y'all with me all right
[59:35] so um let's continue to read there in um
[59:39] in
[59:40] 195 if people look at
[59:42] Rome they look at the nation of Italy
[59:46] and as they look they do not realize
[59:48] that Rome with their strict confines
[59:51] where the where the pope has an actual
[59:53] area as his domain is is literally a
[59:56] nation within a nation she has
[59:59] ambassadors and receives ambassadors
[1:00:02] paple false Christian Rome she is even
[1:00:05] called The Eternal City how Blasphemous
[1:00:08] Now controls by religion even more ably
[1:00:13] than when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled
[1:00:15] by the rule of iron of force by the by
[1:00:18] the pure iron of
[1:00:19] force Rome took on a new lease of life
[1:00:23] when Constantine joined church and state
[1:00:26] and back the Union by force the spirit
[1:00:30] that motivated Pagan Rome is the same
[1:00:33] spirit that now motivates false
[1:00:35] Christian Rome you can see that it is so
[1:00:39] that that it is so because you know how
[1:00:42] that the fourth Empire never went out of
[1:00:45] existence it just changed in its outer
[1:00:48] texture once the NC Council had swung
[1:00:51] the power of political Rome to the
[1:00:52] church it seemed that there were no
[1:00:54] limits to uh to which the First
[1:00:57] Christian Church would go the name
[1:00:59] Christian which originally brought
[1:01:02] persecution now became the name of the
[1:01:05] persecutors it was in this age that
[1:01:08] ainstein of hoo 354 to 430 set forth the
[1:01:12] precept that the church ought and must
[1:01:15] use Force if necessary to bring her
[1:01:18] children back into the F now now this is
[1:01:20] the way they taught it now now listen to
[1:01:22] this that it was in harmony with the
[1:01:25] word of God God to kill the Heretics and
[1:01:27] the apostates in his controversy with uh
[1:01:31] dontine with with the donst he wrote it
[1:01:35] is indeed better that men should be led
[1:01:38] to worship God by teaching them than
[1:01:40] should be driven to it by fear of
[1:01:42] punishment or pain but it does not
[1:01:45] follow that because the former course
[1:01:48] produces the better man therefore who
[1:01:51] does therefore those who do not yield to
[1:01:54] it should be neglected
[1:01:56] for many have found Advantage as we have
[1:01:59] proved and are daily proven by actual
[1:02:01] experience in being first compelled by
[1:02:04] fear or pain so that they might
[1:02:06] afterwards be influenced by its
[1:02:08] teachings so that they might follow out
[1:02:11] in act what they had already learned in
[1:02:14] word whilst those are better who are
[1:02:17] guarded a right by love those are
[1:02:19] certainly more numerous who are
[1:02:21] corrected by fear for who can possibly
[1:02:24] love us more than Christ who laid down
[1:02:27] his life for the Sheep yet after calling
[1:02:30] Peter and the other Apostles by his
[1:02:32] words alone he came to summon Paul and
[1:02:35] he not only constrained him with his
[1:02:37] voice but he dashed him to the Earth
[1:02:39] with his power that he might forcibly
[1:02:41] bring one who is Raging amidst the
[1:02:43] darkness of infidelity to desire the
[1:02:45] light of
[1:02:47] heart he first struck him with a
[1:02:49] physical blindness of eyes why therefore
[1:02:52] should not the church use force in
[1:02:54] compelling her lost Sons to return the
[1:02:57] Lord himself says go out into the
[1:02:58] highways and hedges and compel them to
[1:03:00] come in wherefore if the power which the
[1:03:03] church is received by Divine appointment
[1:03:05] in its due season through the religious
[1:03:08] character and the faith of Kings be the
[1:03:10] instrument by by which those who are
[1:03:12] found in the highways and hedges that is
[1:03:14] in the heresies and schisms are
[1:03:17] compelled to come in then let them not
[1:03:19] be found fault with being compelled now
[1:03:23] that's that's that was their teachings I
[1:03:25] was now that's the way they believed
[1:03:27] either you accept it by free will or we
[1:03:30] will we will torture you we will rip
[1:03:34] babies out that's when the babies were
[1:03:36] all ripped out of the bellies that's
[1:03:37] when and and just just to get people to
[1:03:42] recant their pure faith in Jesus Christ
[1:03:46] the Catholic Church would burn him to
[1:03:47] the Stak they would they would do all of
[1:03:50] those things there to try to get the
[1:03:53] church the G the true Christian Church
[1:03:57] to bow to the heresies of the Roman
[1:04:01] Catholic Church to bow to the idols to
[1:04:04] bow to the Purgatory to bow to these
[1:04:08] Heathen things that they had brought in
[1:04:11] from the other Pagan uh uh all the way
[1:04:14] down to Babel as we read last week so so
[1:04:17] these guys were were were out and and it
[1:04:21] and it brought such fear upon all of the
[1:04:24] earth that that the true Christians went
[1:04:27] into hiding they went into the catacombs
[1:04:29] that's when you where you read the
[1:04:30] catacombs and and those places there
[1:04:32] were there were there were thousands of
[1:04:34] Christians that were hiding and and uh
[1:04:37] living living uh in in secret because
[1:04:42] they feared for their lives the majority
[1:04:45] of the world bowed to this Roman
[1:04:48] Catholic Church I just want to tell you
[1:04:51] the gospel is not a gospel of force God
[1:04:56] doesn't GE Force no person to serve him
[1:05:00] and any spirit that is going to force
[1:05:03] you whether it's sitting in the pews
[1:05:05] trying to force the preacher to I don't
[1:05:07] like whether you're doing this I don't
[1:05:08] like the way or the preacher up forcing
[1:05:11] the congregation you're going to see it
[1:05:13] this way and you're going to see it any
[1:05:15] if there is a spirit of force it's not
[1:05:17] the spirit of God true God does not use
[1:05:21] a whip he is not a cowboy to to round up
[1:05:25] the cattle he is a shepherd and my sheep
[1:05:29] will hear my voice and follow me amen so
[1:05:34] so there it is God Is Not the god of
[1:05:37] force he is a God that knows that you
[1:05:41] who you are and you should know who he
[1:05:43] is and you should follow his word amen
[1:05:47] amen all right praise the Lord now um so
[1:05:52] let's read another page how about it it
[1:05:55] says says the thirst for blood was
[1:05:57] growing a paste now we're still on 196
[1:06:00] first
[1:06:01] paragraph the the false Vine in Spain
[1:06:04] now played upon the emperor Maximus to
[1:06:07] join in the attacks upon the true
[1:06:09] believers who had the word and the signs
[1:06:11] and wanders with them thus some
[1:06:14] Pilan were brought to Travis by Bishop
[1:06:19] ethicus there in 385 he accused them of
[1:06:22] Witchcraft immorality and many were
[1:06:25] executed
[1:06:26] Martin of Tours Ambrose of Malon
[1:06:30] protested this and pleaded in vain for
[1:06:32] the persecution to cease when the
[1:06:34] persecution was prolonged these two
[1:06:36] Bishops refused to fellowship with
[1:06:38] Bishop uh Hiatus and others like him
[1:06:42] strange to say uh the the Senate of
[1:06:45] Travis approved of the murders from this
[1:06:48] time on especially through the Dark Ages
[1:06:51] we will see the children of the flesh
[1:06:53] persecute and destroy the children of
[1:06:54] the spirit
[1:06:56] though both claim one father even as was
[1:06:58] in the case of ishma and Isaac the
[1:07:01] darkness of the spiritual corruption
[1:07:03] will deepen and the True Light Of God
[1:07:06] will fade until number-wise it glows
[1:07:10] ever so faintly yet the promise of God
[1:07:12] will hold true the light shineth in the
[1:07:15] darkness and the Darkness can do nothing
[1:07:17] about it now up to this time I have not
[1:07:21] brought out the point in history that I
[1:07:23] promis to cover that is the interner
[1:07:25] Mingle of religion of nimrod and the
[1:07:27] Christian religion you will recall that
[1:07:30] adelus fled from Babylon to pergamus and
[1:07:33] set up his kingdom outside the reaches
[1:07:35] of the Roman Empire it flourished over
[1:07:38] the years nurtured by the God of this
[1:07:40] world a succession of priest Kings
[1:07:43] followed adlas until the reign of adlas
[1:07:47] III uh when for reasons known only in
[1:07:50] the sovereignty of God he willed the
[1:07:52] kingdom to Rome Julius Caesar then took
[1:07:56] both the kingdom physical and spiritual
[1:07:59] for he became pontiff Maximus of the
[1:08:03] babylonish religion and was therefore
[1:08:05] priest king this title passed on to the
[1:08:08] following Emperors until the time of
[1:08:10] Maximus 3 who refused it according to
[1:08:14] Steven's history it was then that the
[1:08:16] pope took the headship the emperor
[1:08:19] rejected and today there is still a
[1:08:21] pontiff in the world and he is truly
[1:08:24] pontiff Maximus
[1:08:26] he wears a Triple Crown resides in Rome
[1:08:29] and in Revelation 17 God does not any
[1:08:32] longer refer to pergamus as Satan's seat
[1:08:35] nor does he say that is where Satan
[1:08:37] dwells no the throne room is no longer
[1:08:40] in pergamus but is M but is Mystery
[1:08:44] Babylon it is in it is not in Babylon
[1:08:47] but in mystery Babylon it is a it is in
[1:08:50] a city on Seven Hills its head is
[1:08:53] Antichrist for he is usurp
[1:08:56] the position of Christ who alone is
[1:08:58] mediator and who alone can forgive sins
[1:09:02] yes pontiff Maximus is with us
[1:09:07] today so so you can see how how that it
[1:09:12] has all come about and um and you can
[1:09:15] see how that how that this thing has has
[1:09:18] been so so
[1:09:21] incredible and and see that the
[1:09:24] scriptures are are so right on the money
[1:09:29] with history it predicted these things
[1:09:32] were going to happen and and that it
[1:09:35] does now I would um uh let let me just
[1:09:41] show you a scripture here where I
[1:09:44] um here in in the Book of Revelations
[1:09:47] the 17th
[1:09:48] chapter and um and show you how that all
[1:09:52] of these other denominations were going
[1:09:54] to come out of this and
[1:09:59] so um if you look there at Revelations
[1:10:01] the 17th
[1:10:03] chapter and
[1:10:06] um uh you can you can read
[1:10:11] uh this this is prophesying of this of
[1:10:14] of this church that would commit
[1:10:16] fornication be the false Church she
[1:10:19] would be called a here and she's
[1:10:21] committed fornication with all the kings
[1:10:23] of the world and says start at the first
[1:10:25] verse and there came one of the Seven
[1:10:26] Angels which had seven vials and talked
[1:10:29] with me saying unto me come hither and I
[1:10:31] will show unto thee the Judgment of the
[1:10:33] great that Seth upon many Waters
[1:10:35] what is many Waters y'all remember way
[1:10:36] back when peoples multitudes Nations is
[1:10:40] that right with whom the kings of the
[1:10:43] Earth have committed fornication and the
[1:10:45] inhabitants of the Earth have been made
[1:10:47] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[1:10:49] so he carried me in the spirit Into the
[1:10:52] Wilderness what do Babylonian Babylon
[1:10:56] Babylon means Wilderness confusion I saw
[1:10:59] a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[1:11:02] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[1:11:04] heads and 10 horns and the woman was
[1:11:07] array in purple and scarlet color decked
[1:11:09] with gold and precious stones and Pearls
[1:11:11] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[1:11:13] the Abomination and filthiness of her
[1:11:15] fornication and upon her forehead was a
[1:11:18] name written mystery Babylon the great
[1:11:21] the mother of harlots and Abominations
[1:11:24] of the Earth
[1:11:26] I saw the woman drunken with the blood
[1:11:28] of the Saints 68 million of them with
[1:11:31] the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and
[1:11:34] when I saw her I wandered with great
[1:11:37] admiration and the angel said unto me
[1:11:41] wherefore just thou Marvel I will tell
[1:11:43] thee The Mystery of the woman and of the
[1:11:45] Beast that carried her which had the
[1:11:48] seven heads and the 10 horns okay so now
[1:11:51] he's he's he's this is this is where
[1:11:53] he's going to tell us now he's going now
[1:11:55] he's going to tell us what the what the
[1:11:57] seven heads were and he going to tell us
[1:11:59] exactly what this is going to be we'll
[1:12:01] read this and then U then we'll finish
[1:12:03] up and it's and it's going to point to
[1:12:06] Rome did you know that that the Catholic
[1:12:08] church that Rome brags that it is the
[1:12:12] city on Seven
[1:12:15] Hills did y'all know that that's what
[1:12:17] that's what the Roman Church brags about
[1:12:19] let's look here in scripture the Beast
[1:12:21] that thou sawest was not and is not now
[1:12:24] that's the power that's the fourth world
[1:12:26] power that brother brandham uh that we
[1:12:28] just read shall Ascend out of the
[1:12:29] bottomless pit and go into predition and
[1:12:32] they that dwell on the Earth shall
[1:12:35] wonder whose names were not written in
[1:12:38] the Book of Life from the foundation of
[1:12:40] the world when they behold the Beast
[1:12:42] that was is not and yet is the Roman
[1:12:46] Empire is dead but it's been revived in
[1:12:50] papal Rome all right here is the mind
[1:12:53] which has wisdom the seven heads are the
[1:12:57] seven mountains on which the woman sits
[1:13:01] and there are seven Kings five are
[1:13:03] Fallen one is the other is not yet come
[1:13:06] and when he cometh he will continue for
[1:13:08] a short space and the Beast that was is
[1:13:11] not even he is the eighth and as the
[1:13:14] seventh and shall go into to uh
[1:13:18] predition and the T horns which thou
[1:13:20] sawest are the 10 Kings which shall have
[1:13:22] not received King uh received no King
[1:13:25] kdom as yet but shall receive power as
[1:13:27] kings one hour with the Beast these have
[1:13:31] one mind and shall give power and
[1:13:33] strength unto the Beast now now this is
[1:13:36] right where we are right now today this
[1:13:38] is this is all setting stage right now
[1:13:41] the Catholic church is going to come in

[1:14:02] power and strength un the Beast and
[1:14:04] these shall make war with the lamb and

[1:14:07] the Lord of lords the king of kings and
[1:14:09] they that are with him are called Chosen
[1:14:11] and faithful someone say hallelujah and
[1:14:14] he saith unto me the waters which thou

[1:14:36] shall be fulfilled and the woman which
[1:14:38] thou sawest is that great city which
[1:14:42] reth over the kings of the earth now
[1:14:47] without getting through all of that
[1:14:49] there's a city that is sitting on the
[1:14:51] Seven Hills she claims to be the
[1:14:56] church she is the one all her baptisms
[1:15:00] her every so many of these dogmas that
[1:15:04] have that that's in all of the churches
[1:15:06] today has stemmed from her she is the
[1:15:08] mother of harlots and then the Bible
[1:15:11] says this woman is a great
[1:15:14] City isn't that just incredible how God
[1:15:18] for
[1:15:19] tells that Rome was

[1:16:10] pope and they're going to bring peace to
[1:16:12] the Earth he's going to he's going to

[1:22:04] questions and if I don't know all of
[1:22:06] them and uh sometimes sometimes where

[1:22:13] answers and it and it and it helps
[1:22:15] clarify things you know and so um but
[1:22:18] we're all I'm glad to belong to the body
[1:22:21] of Christ brother Joe
[1:22:26] that's right that's right yep and
[1:22:29] brother brother bradam says that you the
[1:22:31] Babylon was the seat we know that but
[1:22:34] then the then then in this church age it
[1:22:37] says the seat has been moved from
[1:22:38] Babylon to
[1:22:40] pergamus and that's where and that's
[1:22:43] where the first Rome Church came he says
[1:22:46] today you're not going to find it in
[1:22:48] pergamus pergamus is long gone but now
[1:22:51] that church amen has come to its Mater
[1:22:54] it's it's it is located there in Rome so
[1:22:56] it started in the pergamus church age
[1:22:59] and now here we are uh on that
[1:23:03] City there the city on Seven Hills
[1:23:07] that's right mystery Babylon praise the
[1:23:10] Lord amen for the
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:35] yeah
[1:23:38] yeah
[1:23:40] yeah it's it's a pretty bold statement
[1:23:45] it knowing what you and I know we we we
[1:23:49] we we say now Trump now now now buddy
[1:23:51] you've done a good job but I just don't
[1:23:53] know if you're going to be 'll do this
[1:23:58] one I I can see I can see I can see both
[1:24:02] ways and and again this is just my
[1:24:05] opinion has nothing to do with the Bible
[1:24:07] has nothing to do okay if there's anyone
[1:24:09] that could cut a deal with the Catholic
[1:24:11] Church it would be Trump all right he
[1:24:15] could he could cut us cut us deal and
[1:24:17] say hey we're needing some help here and
[1:24:20] and um I mean you know saying that we'll
[1:24:23] we'll paint his steps or something so so
[1:24:26] there's that on the other hand you've
[1:24:30] got this what appears to be a ditsy
[1:24:32] woman that that but we know some her
[1:24:36] policies and we know some of the things
[1:24:37] she's a cruel woman of of the past this
[1:24:41] could be that rising in power of a
[1:24:44] wicked woman that
[1:24:45] will that would be more than happy to
[1:24:48] show the US and the world I'm not the
[1:24:50] Dixie woman you think I am she is very
[1:24:54] corrupt in her way of thinking she is
[1:24:56] wicked in in in the terms of life and
[1:25:00] and and and the transgender and all this
[1:25:03] she is she is you put her in power
[1:25:06] unreserved power there is no telling so
[1:25:09] I you know it it's going to be
[1:25:11] interesting because you can see it you
[1:25:13] could you could see both ways um leading
[1:25:16] you know but uh I do know there was a
[1:25:21] vision about a very Wicked Woman
[1:25:24] and um and that brother brandham thought
[1:25:26] the Catholic Church would be involved in
[1:25:28] that and so um you know we we're we're
[1:25:33] either way I believe we're here I I I
[1:25:37] believe we're here and
[1:25:41] uh so it's interesting it is
[1:25:45] interesting anyone else have anything

[1:25:49] say praise the
[1:25:51] Lord Brother Merl

[1:28:52] Israel and the Nations turning against
[1:28:55] Israel this is this is the Bible's

[1:29:03] people that would be like a bride be the
[1:29:05] Bride of the Lord who has made got her
[1:29:07] garments clean and pure and spotless and
