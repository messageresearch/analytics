[40:30] I'm not going to take it weary I'm not
[40:32] going to take it not down I'm flying out
[40:35] here happy
[40:37] happy amen amen
[40:40] [Applause]
[40:43] amen
[40:45] let's open our Bibles to job 23 and 1 if
[40:49] you would
[40:51] I love that song it's like my most
[40:53] favorite song ever I'll Fly Away
[40:57] looking forward to that day
[41:00] get to feeling a little bit down I sing
[41:02] that song I get to feeling a little bit
[41:04] Earthbound and I sing that song I get to
[41:08] fill in a little bit of this and I sing
[41:09] that song and then I just get happy and
[41:11] guess what I sing that song Amen
[41:15] oh yes one of these days and it's coming
[41:19] every single day that we live brothers
[41:22] and sisters on this Earth we are one day
[41:25] closer to going home
[41:27] you know it it may not be in the morning
[41:30] and it may not be in the next morning
[41:33] but this much I know if I wake up in the
[41:36] morning and I'm still here I'm just one
[41:39] day closer to the next morning that I
[41:41] ain't here
[41:42] amen
[41:44] amen ah God has promised it I believe it
[41:48] and I'm going to take that Heavenly
[41:49] flight amen
[41:51] so job 23-1
[41:54] then job answered and said
[41:56] even today is my complaint bitter
[42:01] my stroke is heavier than my groaning
[42:04] all that I knew where I might find him
[42:08] that I might come even to his seat I
[42:11] would order my cause before him and fill
[42:14] my mouth with argument
[42:16] and I would know the words which he
[42:19] would answer me and understand what he
[42:22] would say unto me
[42:25] and then in John chapter 20
[42:29] started verse 11.
[42:36] amen
[42:39] and then so John 20 and 11 it said but
[42:41] Mary stood without at the septic or
[42:44] weeping and now she wept she stooped
[42:46] down and looked into the Sepulcher and
[42:49] seeth two angels in white setting the
[42:51] one at the head and the other at the
[42:53] feet where the body of Jesus had laying
[42:56] and they say unto her woman why weep us
[42:59] thou
[43:00] she saith unto them because they have
[43:02] taken away my Lord and I know not where
[43:06] they have laid him
[43:07] amen
[43:09] and I know not where they have laid him
[43:12] so here's two people in the Bible
[43:14] that just want to know where God is
[43:17] they just want answers to their
[43:19] questions
[43:20] they have fears they have trials they
[43:23] have torments and they just want to know
[43:27] where they can find him
[43:31] let's go to the Lord in prayer
[43:33] dear heavenly father Lord we come before
[43:36] you tonight so thankful for the great
[43:38] wonderful things you've given us already
[43:40] today Lord
[43:42] Lord my cup already overfloweth over
[43:45] into my saucer father you've you brought
[43:47] me so much today
[43:49] but Lord I ask you one more time to come
[43:51] move us out of the way and come down and
[43:54] speak to your people and open the ears
[43:56] of your people to hear what you have to
[43:58] say Lord because Lord we know anything
[44:00] that I say is worthless but if you'll
[44:02] say it it'll bring life for you are the
[44:05] life Lord so we ask you to do it we ask
[44:08] you to come as you promised in the name
[44:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[44:13] y'all can be seated if you like and be
[44:16] comfortable if I had a title today
[44:19] and uh
[44:21] I know I think I say this just about
[44:23] every time but titles and me usually
[44:25] don't get along because I end up
[44:27] changing them but today it actually
[44:28] stayed the same brother so if I had a
[44:31] title it'd be the Winds of Change
[44:35] uh brother Josh came in this morning and
[44:38] and he was preaching and my goodness if
[44:41] he didn't take my notes and just
[44:44] oh man alive did he he done a good job
[44:48] and I know it was God because there
[44:49] ain't no way I could have done that amen
[44:51] so we're going to Lord willing just
[44:54] piggyback right off of it and just keep
[44:55] right on going amen uh so forgive me if
[44:58] I if I jumble it up brother but I I
[45:01] really can't get over that this morning
[45:03] God really spoke to me and I probably
[45:05] saying too much but not really I enjoyed
[45:08] this morning amen
[45:10] but I like that God put this in the
[45:13] Bible
[45:15] because it proves that we're not the
[45:16] only ones that cry out
[45:18] for God
[45:19] we're not
[45:23] alone in our little age
[45:26] and I say little age because it really
[45:28] is just a speck brother Brandon said in
[45:30] the circle of life it's just a little
[45:31] speck our entire age isn't the size of a
[45:35] ball peen pin or a ball Point pin if you
[45:38] would
[45:39] I mean so we really are very little in
[45:41] this whole spectrum of life
[45:44] this this whole thing but the one thing
[45:47] that stays constant the one thing that
[45:49] makes us bigger than life itself is
[45:51] Jesus Christ
[45:53] amen and with him we're bigger than life
[45:56] with him we're Eternal beings amen amen
[46:02] so when you come in to this life as the
[46:05] brother was talking in the trials are
[46:07] coming and all the things are hidden and
[46:09] the pressures are on and life is on
[46:11] you're not the only one that thought you
[46:13] were alone you're not the only one
[46:15] that's ever searched for God
[46:17] amen
[46:19] job was in the midst of one of the
[46:22] biggest Trials of his life and he's like
[46:24] if I could just find him
[46:26] I'd ask him because I know
[46:29] I haven't done anything wrong
[46:32] I know
[46:33] and now you know what he could honestly
[46:35] say that
[46:36] because he had sacrificed the sacrifice
[46:39] to God
[46:40] his lamb was still on the altar
[46:43] job could stand there and look anybody
[46:45] in the eye and say I am blameless I am
[46:48] sinless
[46:49] because he done what God had him do the
[46:53] sacrifice was done
[46:55] so then he could come in and say well if
[46:57] I could find him the one that told me to
[47:00] kill the lamb the one that told me to do
[47:03] the sacrifice if I could find him he
[47:06] would come tell you I'm fine
[47:10] this is what he was saying he was
[47:12] telling them you guys have this all
[47:14] wrong I am standing on the word of God
[47:18] so if I could find him
[47:20] then I'm going to put all this in front
[47:22] of him and I'm going to say Lord why
[47:26] why did you do this to me and the Lord's
[47:30] going to Simply look at him and say
[47:31] because I wanted to
[47:34] he did
[47:36] he told Satan have you considered him
[47:38] already known in his mind what he was
[47:40] about to put job through
[47:42] he already knew what he was about to do
[47:44] and he still said have you considered my
[47:46] servant job
[47:48] so if job would have found him he'd
[47:50] looked him in the eye and said because I
[47:52] wanted to
[47:53] and because I could
[47:56] but the biggest reason is to prove I'm
[47:58] God
[48:00] hahaha
[48:01] well you say well how could that prove
[48:03] it well brother when you were talking
[48:05] about the him down there to talking to
[48:07] job and nobody else could hear him you
[48:09] know could you imagine what these guys
[48:12] were thinking
[48:13] oh my goodness he talks to God
[48:16] lip to ear
[48:19] l oh my goodness what have I done
[48:23] what oh no if he can speak to God I'm in
[48:26] trouble because he he's my friend he
[48:28] knows my whole life
[48:30] my whole life
[48:35] every time God comes he brings life and
[48:40] he brings death
[48:42] on the same wind
[48:46] he speaks the word
[48:48] one takes it and lives one rejects it
[48:52] and dies it's the same word it's the
[48:55] same God it's the same holy spirit it's
[48:59] the same
[49:04] it's really up to you
[49:08] you can be the one sitting there just
[49:10] ripping job apart
[49:13] or you can be the other one sitting
[49:14] there going now wait a second you guys
[49:15] don't know what you're talking about
[49:17] look at this guy this guy he said you're
[49:20] telling you there you have no proof and
[49:21] you're just ripping him up and down and
[49:23] shredding him which one
[49:25] would you be
[49:30] the Lord moves through the church
[49:33] brings about a a feeling of repentance
[49:36] on somebody
[49:37] they come running up to the Altar and
[49:39] they fall down on their knees and
[49:40] they're like God forgive me help me Lord
[49:43] I'm sorry and right there at that point
[49:47] they never done it
[49:51] Tennessean forgetfulness it's gone
[49:54] they never done it
[49:57] but are you going to be the one over
[49:58] here
[50:00] man can you believe they did that
[50:02] can you honestly figure this but that
[50:04] day was a Christian and they did that
[50:06] can you believe that oh man or are you
[50:09] going to be the one over here well
[50:10] praise the Lord hallelujah we got one
[50:12] more flying into the Gates of Heaven we
[50:14] got one more that made it home can you
[50:17] believe that
[50:18] the spirit of David repentance which
[50:21] side of this coin are you going to be on
[50:25] because it's the same word
[50:27] that went that brought the repentance
[50:30] is the same word if you're rejected
[50:33] brings death
[50:34] amen
[50:36] it's not up to us to judge
[50:40] oh praise the lord it's really not up to
[50:44] us
[50:45] to judge when we see that kind of stuff
[50:49] amen
[50:52] but I I really do
[50:54] like this and I titled this to win to
[50:57] change because
[51:00] I'm going to get somewhere with it I
[51:01] promise Lord willing
[51:04] we're going to go back to that eagle
[51:08] where brother Brandon was talking about
[51:09] that eagle and the little squirrel
[51:11] chirping and all that and the eagle was
[51:13] sitting there and he kept filling his
[51:15] wings that God gave him right and he
[51:17] kept feeling the wings and he kept
[51:19] ruffling those feathers and he kept
[51:21] feeling those wings and and I was like
[51:23] Lord
[51:25] why did that eagle just sit there
[51:29] and keep feeling it I mean I understand
[51:31] that he trusted what God gave him he
[51:34] trusted those wings he trusted
[51:37] all of that but why didn't he fly away
[51:40] before the squirrel started chattering
[51:44] why why didn't he do all of this well
[51:48] when you read a little bit farther
[51:49] brother Brandon said that he got under
[51:51] the storm
[51:53] and so the storm was pushing him down so
[51:56] the pressure that the brother was
[51:58] preaching about this morning was pushing
[51:59] him down and so the eagle come in and
[52:02] said well you know what I'm just going
[52:05] to slip up underneath this branch and
[52:07] I'm going to hide myself in here I'm
[52:09] going to get under this cleft of The
[52:10] Rock and I'm just going to hide right in
[52:13] here until I can feel
[52:15] my way out of here
[52:18] and then it hit me and I went dancing in
[52:21] fact I was actually driving my truck so
[52:23] I don't know if you've ever seen
[52:24] somebody Dance and drive at the same
[52:26] time it doesn't work really good so I
[52:28] thank the Lord for driving my truck for
[52:29] me because it dawned on me at this point
[52:33] he had faith in his wings
[52:36] he had everything he needed to get out
[52:40] of there but he was waiting on one thing
[52:45] when he would move those feathers he was
[52:48] waiting for the wind to change
[52:52] he was waiting for the atmosphere to
[52:55] change
[52:56] he was ruffling those feathers to see if
[52:59] it was going to push him down or if it
[53:01] was going to push him up
[53:04] flexes it out a little bit nope that's
[53:06] still downward I'm not getting in on
[53:08] that ain't getting in on anything that
[53:10] pushes me toward the Earth
[53:12] oh no no no that's an uncertain sound
[53:14] that really pushes you down nope don't
[53:16] like that one
[53:18] ooh
[53:19] looky there
[53:20] two flaps and he just shed his wings in
[53:23] faith and was gone why the winds have
[53:26] changed the storm was no longer pushing
[53:28] him toward the ground the storm was
[53:31] taking him out
[53:33] foreign
[53:36] the same wind that pushed him down was
[53:39] the same exact wind that took him out
[53:44] the brother preached it so well the
[53:46] trials that comes comes from God
[53:49] where are you going to find him in your
[53:52] trial
[53:54] that's what job was missing when he was
[53:56] asking if I knew where he was if I knew
[53:58] where he was he was there the whole time
[53:59] heard the whole conversation
[54:02] so when he comes in on that wind I've
[54:05] got scripture for it let's read some of
[54:07] it
[54:09] Psalms 107 will start at 21.
[54:12] I I
[54:14] it really did I got home from work I was
[54:16] jumping and shouting and hollering up to
[54:18] think April thought something was wrong
[54:19] with me
[54:20] Psalms 107 and 21.
[54:22] oh that men would praise the Lord for
[54:24] his goodness
[54:25] and for his wonderful Works to the
[54:27] children of men and let them sacrifice
[54:30] the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and
[54:32] declare his works with rejoicing
[54:36] they that go down to the Sea and ships
[54:39] that do business in Great Waters these
[54:41] see the works of the Lord and his
[54:43] wonders in the Deep for he commandeth
[54:46] and raised it the stormy wind which
[54:49] lifteth up the waves thereof they mount
[54:52] up to the heaven they go down again to
[54:54] the depths their soul is melted because
[54:57] of trouble they reel to and fro and
[55:00] stagger like a drunken man and are at
[55:02] their wit's end then they cry unto the
[55:04] Lord in their trouble and he bringeth
[55:06] them out of their distresses he maketh
[55:08] the storm of calm so that the waves
[55:10] thereof are still then are they glad
[55:13] because they be quiet so he bringeth
[55:15] them unto their desired Haven he brought
[55:19] the storm
[55:20] waited for him to ask and then took it
[55:23] away and got all the glory
[55:27] but he brings the storm
[55:32] but then the going and going and going
[55:34] and as soon as you cry out to God he
[55:35] just changes the wind
[55:40] so let's go to another scripture
[55:43] let's go to
[55:46] second Samuel 22
[55:48] and that's kind of a long one but I'm
[55:50] going to go ahead and read the whole
[55:51] thing anyway we'll start at verse 1.
[55:58] who they really like I said it really
[56:01] struck me and I'm excited so if I jump
[56:03] all over the place forgive me but we
[56:06] really are not Earthbound creatures
[56:09] we're really not
[56:13] if we if brother random said that we can
[56:15] speak and change our atmosphere we can
[56:17] we can do all this stuff why can't we
[56:19] change our own win and get off this
[56:21] Earth
[56:21] well we're supposed to be gathering in
[56:23] Heavenly places with Christ Jesus right
[56:25] he's only going to come down so far we
[56:27] heard brother Wendell he said it like
[56:29] two or three services now that God's not
[56:31] going to step foot on this Earth yet
[56:32] it's not time oh yeah he's appeared his
[56:35] spirit is here but himself right we know
[56:38] the only way we're going to do it is to
[56:40] meet him
[56:42] but we don't have to wait until the day
[56:45] that we fly out of here to meet him we
[56:48] don't have to wait to be in Heavenly
[56:49] places you are not an earth-bound
[56:52] creature
[56:56] get ahead of myself that's
[56:58] that's a love giving the punchline first
[56:59] so
[57:00] II Samuel 22 and 1 and David spake unto
[57:04] the Lord the words of this song in the
[57:06] day that the Lord had delivered him out
[57:08] of the hand of his enemies and out of
[57:11] the hand of Saul
[57:12] and he said the Lord is my rock and my
[57:15] Fortress and my deliverer the god of my
[57:17] rock and him will I trust he is my
[57:20] shield in the Horn of my salvation my
[57:22] high tower and my refuge My Savior thou
[57:25] savest me from violence I will call on
[57:28] the Lord who is worthy to be praised so
[57:30] shall I be saved from mine enemies when
[57:33] the waves of death Compass me the floods
[57:35] of ungodly men made me afraid the
[57:38] Sorrows of Hell compassed me about the
[57:41] snares of death prevented me in my
[57:43] distress I called upon the Lord and
[57:45] cried to my God and he did hear my voice
[57:48] out of his Temple and My Cry did enter
[57:52] into his ears then
[57:56] then the Earth Shook and trembled the
[58:00] foundations of Heaven moved and shook
[58:02] because he was Roth
[58:05] you ever wonder when you pray pray to
[58:07] God it seems like everything gets worse
[58:09] you say a prayer and you're like Lord I
[58:11] need you I'm in trouble and everything
[58:13] falls apart
[58:15] you know you're praying for one vehicle
[58:16] and everything in the house goes out
[58:18] finally get the vehicle fixed get the
[58:19] house fix the truck breaks down
[58:21] truck breaks down you're like well I
[58:23] ain't got the money to fix it so I'm
[58:24] just going to let it wait well you
[58:25] should have fixed it because now you're
[58:26] going to spend the money on the washing
[58:27] machine because it's going to go out and
[58:29] then why the Earth shook the foundations
[58:32] of the heaven shook why because you
[58:34] prayed to God and he moved
[58:37] oh that's scriptural too when he came
[58:40] down to the children of Israel and he
[58:41] was on the mountain there was
[58:43] earthquakes and there was smoke and
[58:44] there was fire so much so the people
[58:46] were scared to death to approach the
[58:48] mountain
[58:54] just because we think our life is
[58:56] falling apart doesn't mean it is
[58:59] just because we think we're stuck
[59:02] doesn't mean we are
[59:05] you prayed the prayer of a righteous man
[59:08] or woman God is obligated to do
[59:12] something because he wrote it in his
[59:14] scriptures the prayer of a righteous man
[59:16] of baileth much so as soon as you pray
[59:20] the prayer God has to move
[59:23] now it doesn't mean he's going to show
[59:25] up at your doorstep right now it may be
[59:28] 25 years later but that's okay because
[59:30] he started moving the minute you prayed
[59:37] then the Earth Shook and trembled the
[59:39] foundation of the heaven moved and shook
[59:41] because he was Roth there went up a
[59:44] smoke out of his nostrils and a fire out
[59:46] of his mouth devoured coals were kindled
[59:49] by it he bowed the heavens also
[59:53] or maybe booed the heavens also and came
[59:56] down and darkness was under his feet and
[59:59] he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he
[1:00:03] was seen on the wings of the Wind
[1:00:09] the same wind that brought the storm he
[1:00:12] was riding it
[1:00:13] the same wind that takes the storm out
[1:00:15] he was riding it
[1:00:18] oh brothers and sisters don't you see he
[1:00:21] gives Satan the okay he says I tell you
[1:00:23] what Satan's like I got him this time I
[1:00:24] could take them
[1:00:25] same thing he said about job you let me
[1:00:27] do this I'll take him he's like I got
[1:00:29] him I'm telling you Lord right now if
[1:00:31] you'll just let me do it I got him Lord
[1:00:33] says okay go ahead Satan immediately
[1:00:36] well let's just take the the disciples
[1:00:39] out in the boat right oh he's like go
[1:00:42] for it it's all right I'm up in the
[1:00:43] mountain praying you do whatever you
[1:00:44] want down there well that well Satan
[1:00:47] can't create right so he just takes
[1:00:49] what's already there and he gets the
[1:00:50] wind and he gets the whipping that wind
[1:00:51] around and whipping that wind around and
[1:00:53] whipping he's like I got him now and the
[1:00:55] Sea starts rolling and everything going
[1:00:56] and all of a sudden you look out there
[1:00:58] and there's Jesus
[1:01:01] standing out there
[1:01:03] why because he was on the same wind that
[1:01:07] he gave Satan permission to use he wrote
[1:01:10] it in to save you
[1:01:13] the same wind that Satan got permission
[1:01:17] to start the trial to start the trouble
[1:01:20] to bring the storm is the exact same
[1:01:23] wind that reports to God
[1:01:27] there's only four winds The North Wind
[1:01:30] the south wind the East Wind and the
[1:01:31] West Wind
[1:01:32] and he controls all four well yeah
[1:01:35] because the Bible said nope you go back
[1:01:37] to your places it's not time for you yet
[1:01:38] because when they actually come out of
[1:01:41] their Corners it's going to bring
[1:01:42] tribulations on the Earth and it's not
[1:01:45] quite time yet but doesn't mean that
[1:01:47] Satan can't stir up the pot
[1:01:51] says all right use a little bit of it
[1:01:53] just give Satan like a a nostril full of
[1:01:55] it there and let him really think he's
[1:01:57] something big and Satan grabs the halt
[1:01:59] of that wind and he's like I got him now
[1:02:01] and here he goes and God's standing
[1:02:03] right behind him
[1:02:04] he don't even realize it he's so bound
[1:02:07] and determined he's got you he don't
[1:02:09] even realize that God is riding the same
[1:02:11] exact wind right behind him
[1:02:13] Satan comes in for the kill here he
[1:02:15] comes he's like I got him I got him I
[1:02:17] got him and as he sweeps by he hits them
[1:02:19] with cancer
[1:02:21] whoo immediately oh no oh no
[1:02:25] God's like huh and Satan takes and heads
[1:02:27] back to his hole I got him now you wait
[1:02:29] and see next time I see the Lord I got
[1:02:31] him
[1:02:32] God is still on that wind he just simply
[1:02:34] turns it back around and he waits
[1:02:37] and he's sitting there and he waits he's
[1:02:38] on with his cherubs on the wind and he's
[1:02:40] waiting and all of a sudden he hears it
[1:02:42] oh God
[1:02:44] the doctor told me
[1:02:46] and I don't believe him because your
[1:02:48] word said you healed all of my diseases
[1:02:50] It's Already Done Lord there's no way I
[1:02:52] can have this cancer because you already
[1:02:54] said you healed me from it so and what
[1:02:56] does God do turns that same exact wind
[1:02:58] back around heads it right back the
[1:03:00] opposite direction and on his way
[1:03:01] through grabs the cancer on his way up
[1:03:04] all right
[1:03:07] he brings the storm he takes the storm
[1:03:10] nothing
[1:03:13] absolutely nothing can take you from the
[1:03:16] love of God Paul said it
[1:03:20] he said I am persuaded or whichever word
[1:03:23] did he use that nothing and he went
[1:03:25] through a list not this not this not
[1:03:27] this not this none of this none of this
[1:03:29] none of this can take you away from the
[1:03:30] love of God nothing
[1:03:34] absolutely nothing
[1:03:38] so why are we still stuck on the ground
[1:03:43] well you say brother we're here we got
[1:03:46] to rub shoulders with this we got it in
[1:03:48] oh yeah I agree with that I really do
[1:03:51] we are here we're here for a purpose and
[1:03:53] when our purpose known God takes us home
[1:03:55] and I get that
[1:03:56] we have the faith that God gave us
[1:04:00] but he also sends back anointings to run
[1:04:03] that faith
[1:04:04] okay he doesn't leave you alone he said
[1:04:07] I'll send it back so I think the first
[1:04:09] one was a lion
[1:04:11] I may have the first two mixed up but I
[1:04:13] think the first one he sent back the
[1:04:14] lion anointing and then it was the ox
[1:04:16] anointing and under that one the people
[1:04:19] actually went to their own Slaughter
[1:04:21] with a glow of Love on their face so
[1:04:24] great that brother Branham actually said
[1:04:26] that they couldn't have that that's why
[1:04:28] they ended it all was because they were
[1:04:31] coming into their desk with their faces
[1:04:33] Shining
[1:04:34] and they're like well we can't have this
[1:04:38] where's your shine
[1:04:42] you're like well it was it was you know
[1:04:44] it was anointing of the time right oh I
[1:04:46] get that uh I get it
[1:04:50] but isn't the same love of God
[1:04:53] it's the same everything different
[1:04:55] annoying but still the same God if you
[1:04:57] love him as much as they did where's our
[1:04:59] Holy Ghost shine
[1:05:02] why can't people look at us and see the
[1:05:04] difference
[1:05:05] why can't people take one look at you
[1:05:06] brother Merle and go wow he's going
[1:05:10] they can you brother I'm just using you
[1:05:12] for an example
[1:05:13] all right so but hey and it does work
[1:05:17] because when you testify to somebody
[1:05:18] they know if you have it or you don't
[1:05:21] and you cannot testify something you
[1:05:23] haven't lived
[1:05:25] you can try all day long it ain't gonna
[1:05:28] work
[1:05:29] but if you've lived through it and God's
[1:05:31] brought you out the other side of it
[1:05:32] when you speak to people it works
[1:05:36] and that's why you went through it
[1:05:39] because God knew you'd come out on the
[1:05:40] other side so that you could reach back
[1:05:42] and grab your brother and pull them
[1:05:44] through the other side
[1:05:48] so he brings the ox
[1:05:50] and they all go left and right dying
[1:05:52] happy smiles just a glowing happy as
[1:05:55] they can be laying their heads on The
[1:05:57] Chopping Block I I wonder how many of
[1:05:59] those executioners got saved knowing
[1:06:02] good well when that they put their head
[1:06:04] down there on that block for that ax to
[1:06:06] fall down the glow that came off that
[1:06:08] body and the Praises that they were
[1:06:10] singing and asking God to forgive them
[1:06:12] and all of the humility and all of the
[1:06:15] love I wonder how many of those guys ran
[1:06:18] just dropped it and said not me I ain't
[1:06:20] doing it
[1:06:21] doesn't say but I bet there was a bunch
[1:06:24] of them
[1:06:25] because I tell you what if I come up on
[1:06:26] a Christian like that and I saw that
[1:06:28] glow of the heavenly father I couldn't
[1:06:30] have swung that thing
[1:06:31] they couldn't have paid me enough money
[1:06:32] they said well I'm going to kill you
[1:06:34] well you better make it faster I'm going
[1:06:35] to get over that wall
[1:06:37] you know it's pretty simple I'm pretty
[1:06:39] fast when I want to be you know I may
[1:06:42] not had
[1:06:43] to be able to do like they did and just
[1:06:45] put it there but I wouldn't well
[1:06:47] they glowed with their anointing
[1:06:50] then the next one
[1:06:51] was the man anointing all the reform
[1:06:54] right everybody's so smart everybody's
[1:06:57] intellect they're building Bibles
[1:06:59] they're coming out of the the uh
[1:07:02] Dark Ages you know and now the
[1:07:04] scriptures are coming to the people and
[1:07:06] everybody's so smart and everybody's so
[1:07:08] smart and everybody's so smart
[1:07:12] that they really ain't no good
[1:07:14] you know I heard a guy say one time you
[1:07:16] know they're so Heavenly minded they
[1:07:18] ain't no earthly good I was like well
[1:07:20] praise the Lord
[1:07:23] why ain't we Heavenly minded so much we
[1:07:25] ain't no earthly good because that Earth
[1:07:27] out there ain't mine
[1:07:28] oh the ground underneath it's mine but
[1:07:31] that out there Satan's eating I don't
[1:07:32] want nothing to do with that God let me
[1:07:34] be so Heavenly minded I ain't no earthly
[1:07:36] good because if I'm Heavenly minded I'll
[1:07:39] pull my brothers up
[1:07:43] the next one that comes into the eagle
[1:07:45] anointing
[1:07:47] oh
[1:07:48] there's the wind under his wings he was
[1:07:50] waiting for the change the changes come
[1:07:53] the other three were Earth Brown
[1:07:54] creatures
[1:07:55] the Eagle's not an Earthbound creature
[1:07:59] brother Wendell preaching about the word
[1:08:01] that anchored that anchor that's holding
[1:08:03] you well that anchor ain't on this Earth
[1:08:06] that anchor that's holding you is in the
[1:08:09] heavens
[1:08:11] that anchor that's holding you is a
[1:08:13] Celestial thing
[1:08:15] that word that's holding you don't
[1:08:17] belong down here so when that anchor is
[1:08:20] pulling you back out of the storm where
[1:08:22] is that anchor pulling you it's pulling
[1:08:24] you back to Heavenly places in Christ
[1:08:26] Jesus
[1:08:29] the storms come and they push you down
[1:08:32] but the anchor pulls you back
[1:08:35] I love it but the Heavenly places why
[1:08:38] because we are not earth-bound creatures
[1:08:42] the anointing isn't even an Earthbound
[1:08:45] anointing
[1:08:46] the seventh angel comes the Mysteries
[1:08:48] are all revealed we have the open book
[1:08:51] we have everything that we need to do
[1:08:54] anything that we need to have anything
[1:08:57] that we need why brothers and sisters
[1:09:01] why why why do we get so tied to this
[1:09:05] Earth so bad that we walk around like
[1:09:09] gravity itself is killing us
[1:09:13] why
[1:09:14] our faces droop down
[1:09:17] we get tired
[1:09:19] we frown we don't smile we ain't got no
[1:09:21] joy
[1:09:22] which makes no sense to me
[1:09:25] none
[1:09:27] because
[1:09:28] the physics and the laws of this Earth
[1:09:31] do not never have and never will pertain
[1:09:35] to you
[1:09:38] gravity can't pull you down when the
[1:09:40] anchor is pulling you up
[1:09:42] depression can't pull you down when
[1:09:44] Joy's pulling you up
[1:09:48] the winds have changed the pressure is
[1:09:51] no longer pushing down the pressures of
[1:09:53] life as they push on you and they press
[1:09:55] on you and they hurt and you fight
[1:09:57] they're pushing you up
[1:10:04] we're never going to make it through
[1:10:05] this thing without the love of Jesus
[1:10:07] Christ
[1:10:08] we've got to get to the top of this
[1:10:09] pyramid or it ain't happening
[1:10:13] you can go through it on the ground or
[1:10:16] you can go through it flying knowing
[1:10:18] that the same wind you're in he's
[1:10:20] already riding he controls it he takes
[1:10:23] care of it he moves it he tells it when
[1:10:25] to go he tells it when to stop he tells
[1:10:28] it everything well brother what happens
[1:10:29] if I fall out of the Wind
[1:10:33] you came
[1:10:35] fall out of the wind the whole entire
[1:10:38] atmosphere is the wind
[1:10:40] you know the only you know what causes
[1:10:42] wind
[1:10:43] besides God controlling it the
[1:10:46] atmosphere changes
[1:10:47] high pressure low pressure heat cold
[1:10:54] heat cold lukewarm
[1:10:59] you want to change your atmosphere you
[1:11:01] want to change where you're at get hot
[1:11:05] get in the word get to reading get this
[1:11:07] shouting get the jumping get that
[1:11:09] dancing
[1:11:11] you want to see your atmosphere move go
[1:11:14] cold
[1:11:19] and you'll kill an entire church
[1:11:24] you dance
[1:11:25] you skip you be joyful you walk around
[1:11:29] you come around and then this one rubs
[1:11:31] and then this one erupts and then this
[1:11:34] one erupts and next thing you know
[1:11:35] you've got licks of fire over the entire
[1:11:38] church
[1:11:39] we are not bound to this earth
[1:11:42] we are Heavenly Creatures we live and we
[1:11:46] survive in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:11:48] Jesus
[1:11:50] this world does not control you
[1:11:54] you control this world you have the
[1:11:57] Dominion it was given to you before the
[1:12:00] foundation of the world take what's
[1:12:02] rightfully yours and you can because
[1:12:05] God's in it
[1:12:10] that's Satan's end
[1:12:12] stay out of it Samson
[1:12:15] stay out of it because if you don't
[1:12:18] you'll end up in prison
[1:12:24] but if you'll grab a halt to the wing
[1:12:26] of the great Jehovah
[1:12:28] he said I'm the eagle and you're my
[1:12:30] eaglets
[1:12:31] take your beat and grab a hold of that
[1:12:33] wing
[1:12:34] fly up out of here one time
[1:12:37] get a little bit of warmth going on get
[1:12:40] a little bit of spirit moving just once
[1:12:43] I beg you
[1:12:45] it'll change your life
[1:12:48] it will absolutely change your day to
[1:12:51] day life
[1:12:53] it not only will it heal your body it'll
[1:12:55] heal your mind it'll heal your spirit
[1:12:57] it'll heal your soul it'll heal your job
[1:13:00] it'll even heal that busy body you have
[1:13:02] to work next to every day of your life
[1:13:07] hey John as good as truth
[1:13:09] I had to go to work with a guy
[1:13:11] Lord help him Lord bless him I tell you
[1:13:15] you want to talk about trials
[1:13:17] you know I used to think I was over my
[1:13:19] temper brother
[1:13:21] he pushed the limits a couple times
[1:13:23] finally I was like Lord I don't know
[1:13:25] what to do you either get me out of this
[1:13:26] or something bad it's about to happen
[1:13:28] because God I honestly don't know what
[1:13:30] to do
[1:13:31] all of a sudden he came in he said you
[1:13:32] know what I never knew he was a preacher
[1:13:35] that was like it's because you never
[1:13:36] listened to me but I didn't say that I
[1:13:37] was like oh yeah
[1:13:40] I am he's like well what do you preach
[1:13:41] look at him right now I said Jesus
[1:13:42] Christ
[1:13:44] he said oh yeah that's what everybody
[1:13:45] says I was like yeah but I do it
[1:13:48] and he's like really he's like yeah he
[1:13:50] said well what's the most important
[1:13:52] thing that you could think of if you're
[1:13:54] going to preach Jesus Christ and I
[1:13:56] looked him right now I said the most
[1:13:57] important thing he's like yes I said
[1:13:59] Jesus Christ
[1:14:02] and he looked at me he was like
[1:14:04] well no no no I was like no it is it
[1:14:06] really is I said because it was the
[1:14:08] alpha to the omegas the beginning to the
[1:14:09] end it's Jesus Christ from the start of
[1:14:12] the Old Testament to the end of the New
[1:14:14] Testament it's Jesus Christ every single
[1:14:17] step of it is Jesus Christ and that guy
[1:14:19] looked at me
[1:14:20] he goes so you're trying to tell me
[1:14:23] you're Jesus Christ I said you're
[1:14:25] absolutely right
[1:14:27] and he looked at me he said well okay
[1:14:29] then I'm sorry
[1:14:30] he said I won't cuss no more
[1:14:32] he said I won't do that stuff no more he
[1:14:34] said I'll respect what you believe I
[1:14:36] won't understand it but I respect what
[1:14:37] you believe
[1:14:38] see how simple that was
[1:14:40] but it wasn't me that God did it
[1:14:43] and now when I run into him
[1:14:47] everybody's amazed they're like wow he
[1:14:50] can actually say a whole sentence
[1:14:53] you know because before it was like
[1:14:55] every other word was something horrible
[1:14:57] bad he'd talk about anything including
[1:14:59] my mom and that just don't settle well
[1:15:01] with me you know what I mean and I know
[1:15:02] he was joking just a rough crude guy I'm
[1:15:05] not trying to tear him down my point is
[1:15:07] God changed it
[1:15:11] God was there listening the whole time I
[1:15:15] was
[1:15:20] he was there listening to the same wind
[1:15:24] hot air if you will that the guy was
[1:15:26] spilling out
[1:15:28] okay he was there listening to but you
[1:15:30] know what God wanted
[1:15:33] what he really really wanted
[1:15:35] he wanted me to ask forgiveness for
[1:15:36] getting mad at him
[1:15:39] he wasn't so much worried about what he
[1:15:41] was doing
[1:15:42] that's between him and God
[1:15:45] but he was sitting there waiting for me
[1:15:46] to say Lord I'm sorry I'm losing my mind
[1:15:49] I need you to do something
[1:15:51] because the more I tried to do it myself
[1:15:53] the worse it got
[1:15:55] the more I tried to bring up stuff
[1:15:58] the words it got
[1:16:00] remember it takes God to do anything
[1:16:03] and it takes God to do everything
[1:16:09] when we can come to the realization
[1:16:12] that we're above it
[1:16:15] we're not above people we're not we're
[1:16:18] not better let me rephrase that we're
[1:16:20] not better than people
[1:16:22] but we are above anything in this world
[1:16:26] because the Bible says that he would put
[1:16:28] Satan under his feet
[1:16:31] and if we're the body of Jesus Christ
[1:16:33] and Satan is under our feet
[1:16:35] so this is Satan's Eden so we are
[1:16:38] literally above anything in this world
[1:16:42] payment
[1:16:45] and the whole reason I brought that out
[1:16:46] was my own attitude
[1:16:49] but when I changed that when I wanted a
[1:16:51] change of the atmosphere and I went to
[1:16:54] God I saw him coming in on the wings of
[1:16:58] the Wind
[1:16:59] I saw him coming in as my deliverer I
[1:17:04] saw him Lifting Me Up Above
[1:17:09] and then I find it in the scripture and
[1:17:12] I'm like praise the Lord I wasn't just
[1:17:15] seeing things I really saw God coming
[1:17:17] down on the Wind to pull me out of this
[1:17:19] situation
[1:17:22] for every single biblical question that
[1:17:24] you have there's a Biblical answer
[1:17:28] so if you want an answer to a situation
[1:17:30] God will give it to you
[1:17:33] from the first time I prayed that prayer
[1:17:36] to the time that everything actually
[1:17:37] went through good was a year and two
[1:17:39] months
[1:17:42] a year and two months
[1:17:48] I'm not very good at holding my tongue
[1:17:50] okay I'm really not I
[1:17:53] anyway but God helped me he really did
[1:17:55] and then I saw it
[1:17:58] Bar None hands down when he came through
[1:18:00] and I saw it and I looked up I promise
[1:18:03] you in my mind I saw him standing there
[1:18:05] on the Wind laughing
[1:18:09] because I was like Lord
[1:18:11] why
[1:18:13] because I could
[1:18:15] because I wanted to because I wanted to
[1:18:18] prove you'd keep your mouth shut because
[1:18:20] I wanted to prove you'd keep your temper
[1:18:21] I wanted to prove I had taken the anger
[1:18:24] away from you I wanted to prove to you
[1:18:26] that you're not the same guy you was 20
[1:18:29] years ago even when in the back of your
[1:18:31] mind you're saying well Lord maybe just
[1:18:34] maybe I haven't been completely saved
[1:18:36] well Lord maybe just maybe I haven't
[1:18:39] because Lord I
[1:18:41] Lord I need help and he's over there
[1:18:44] going relax I've got this
[1:18:53] he's got this
[1:18:58] the winds have changed
[1:19:02] the winds of change has already come
[1:19:08] the prophet has preached the message
[1:19:11] the Mysteries are revealed he even said
[1:19:15] himself that he only saw that there was
[1:19:17] one thing left to do
[1:19:19] and that was the rapture
[1:19:21] brothers and sisters the winds have
[1:19:23] changed
[1:19:24] you're not an Earthbound creature you
[1:19:26] never have been an Earthbound creature
[1:19:29] you are a Heavenly creature
[1:19:31] you belong in the heavens
[1:19:34] the pressures of this life allow them to
[1:19:37] push you home
[1:19:40] you come from God you're going back to
[1:19:43] God
[1:19:44] you come from the heavens you're going
[1:19:46] back to the heavens and then yes we get
[1:19:48] to come back and rule the whole thing
[1:19:52] it's a win-win situation
[1:19:54] stop letting this Earth Hold You Down
[1:19:59] when your anchor keeps pulling you back
[1:20:03] the Earth pulls you down the anchors
[1:20:05] brings you back imagine a big bungee
[1:20:07] cord
[1:20:08] jumping off I never would do that saved
[1:20:10] my life anyway I've seen them do it jump
[1:20:13] off the bridges you know the big bungee
[1:20:15] cord they go down down the bungee cord
[1:20:16] stretches stretches stretches stretches
[1:20:17] stretches stretches and why they set
[1:20:19] them so close I don't know but it's
[1:20:21] almost like their head's almost going to
[1:20:23] hit the ground and then all of a sudden
[1:20:25] that bungee core Springs them right back
[1:20:27] again and I'm not even on the thing and
[1:20:30] I'm already losing my stomach
[1:20:32] you know that that kind of ride ain't
[1:20:34] for me but when I see that that's the
[1:20:37] way I picture my anchor
[1:20:39] when this Earth tries to pull me down
[1:20:41] and Satan tries to pull me to the same
[1:20:44] laws of physic as this Earth
[1:20:47] I know without a doubt my anchor will
[1:20:50] bring me back
[1:20:53] I don't know when
[1:20:55] I'm going to hit the end of that bungee
[1:20:57] cord I don't even know how I'm going to
[1:20:59] hit the end of that bungee cord but this
[1:21:01] much I can guarantee I may be falling a
[1:21:04] thousand miles an hour but eventually
[1:21:07] that cord's going to stop and when it
[1:21:09] does Satan let go or you're going back
[1:21:12] to heaven with me
[1:21:14] that simple because I'm not an
[1:21:17] Earthbound creature the winds have
[1:21:19] changed I'm a Heavenly creature
[1:21:22] I am the Son of God the bride to the
[1:21:26] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:27] gravity can't hold me
[1:21:30] sickness can't hold me nothing can hold
[1:21:34] me to this earth and I can say that none
[1:21:37] of those physics hold to me they have
[1:21:39] they pertain nothing to me because not a
[1:21:41] single one of those is making it into
[1:21:43] heaven
[1:21:44] sickness ain't making it into heaven
[1:21:46] brother diseases ain't making it into
[1:21:48] heaven lies ain't making it into heaven
[1:21:51] alcohol ain't licking it into heaven
[1:21:53] drug ain't making it in none of that
[1:21:55] stuff's making it to heaven so if it's
[1:21:57] not making it to heaven and I'm on my
[1:21:59] way to heaven it can't hold me here
[1:22:02] it can't hold me you can't grab me you
[1:22:04] can't do nothing with me because if it
[1:22:06] does them little demons getting saved
[1:22:10] because I'm going to heaven I'm a
[1:22:12] Heavenly creature
[1:22:14] and that's the truth so they cannot hold
[1:22:16] on to you they cannot keep you down they
[1:22:19] can't and they want because they belong
[1:22:22] here and under it because that's where
[1:22:24] God kicked them down to God said you're
[1:22:27] out of Heaven you're going to the Earth
[1:22:28] and he booted them and then started
[1:22:31] laughing and turned and looked at you
[1:22:32] brother Colby and said now will you go
[1:22:34] fight him
[1:22:35] and you looked over that banister and
[1:22:37] said Lord I'll do anything for you
[1:22:41] because you looked too and you saw you
[1:22:43] saw Christ you saw the picture you saw
[1:22:45] it all you don't remember it but you saw
[1:22:48] it and you said Lord that's an awesome
[1:22:50] plan Absolutely I'll go
[1:22:54] I did too I said Lord I'll fight I'll go
[1:22:56] well you know what it's going to cost
[1:22:57] you I don't care
[1:22:59] I'll go why because your honor and your
[1:23:03] glory means more to me than anything
[1:23:06] that you can put me through so if I can
[1:23:09] go down to laodicea and prove that your
[1:23:11] God send me
[1:23:15] that's Heavenly Creatures
[1:23:18] that's what you did before the
[1:23:19] foundation of the world where were you
[1:23:21] in the
[1:23:25] you were standing at the same banister
[1:23:28] he was
[1:23:29] looking out over
[1:23:32] the whole plan
[1:23:33] and he said will you go
[1:23:35] and you said absolutely
[1:23:37] I'll go
[1:23:39] and I'm telling you this because I want
[1:23:41] to bring it back to your remembrance
[1:23:42] because you realize then
[1:23:45] that you already won
[1:23:47] you realize then you couldn't be taken
[1:23:50] down you realize then that God's
[1:23:52] Redemptive plan was perfect
[1:23:57] absolutely perfect
[1:24:00] so you said I'll go and then we get here
[1:24:03] and boy oh boy
[1:24:06] it's a whole nother story ain't it well
[1:24:09] where's the joy you had there
[1:24:11] where's the joy you had at the beginning
[1:24:13] of your salvation
[1:24:18] we should be the happiest people That
[1:24:20] Ever Walked face this planet
[1:24:22] we should be so joyful and so happy that
[1:24:25] we can walk into Walmart of all places
[1:24:27] that I love to call the zoo we can walk
[1:24:30] into Walmart laughing and smiling and
[1:24:32] when we walk out half of that store
[1:24:34] should be saved
[1:24:37] or at least pretending it just to get us
[1:24:39] to shut up
[1:24:42] and I'm serious about that because where
[1:24:44] is it where's the globe where's the
[1:24:47] happy
[1:24:48] where's the testified
[1:24:52] the people of old testified all the way
[1:24:54] up to the chopping block they didn't
[1:24:56] stop Stephen brother out there they're
[1:24:58] Stones just to find just a hitting him
[1:25:00] and he looks up into the he didn't stop
[1:25:02] look I see Jesus on the right hand of
[1:25:04] God
[1:25:06] testified
[1:25:07] can you believe that stones
[1:25:10] so full of the Holy Spirit they didn't
[1:25:12] even feel it didn't even affect him
[1:25:14] didn't even bother him he crawled up in
[1:25:15] the building where God went to sleep so
[1:25:16] brother Brandon said
[1:25:18] right that's what he said
[1:25:20] so when people are throwing verbal
[1:25:22] stones at you and the people you're
[1:25:24] working with giving you four times as
[1:25:25] much work because you're actually going
[1:25:27] to get it done and they're lazy
[1:25:29] right and this one's hitting you and
[1:25:31] this one's hitting you and this Stone's
[1:25:32] hitting you and this Stone's hitting you
[1:25:34] look up your redemption's nigh can you
[1:25:36] see that he's coming in on the Wind look
[1:25:39] Christ is coming
[1:25:43] Heavenly Creatures we're not Earthly
[1:25:45] creatures yes we have to work yes we
[1:25:48] have to live here yes we have to be a
[1:25:50] part of it we have to do it but you
[1:25:52] don't have to act like it
[1:25:58] we don't have to act like everybody else
[1:26:01] we can actually be different because we
[1:26:04] are different
[1:26:06] if you truly are a son and daughter of
[1:26:09] God
[1:26:10] born into the body of Jesus Christ The
[1:26:13] Bride of Jesus Christ you are different
[1:26:16] plain and simple you're different it's
[1:26:19] okay to be different
[1:26:23] as long as you're heavenly
[1:26:26] doesn't mean dying here yeah okay we
[1:26:29] won't go there praise the Lord
[1:26:32] look up
[1:26:34] your Redemption tonight brother and
[1:26:36] sisters as the musicians come look up
[1:26:40] look up
[1:26:42] stop looking at what Satan's and look up
[1:26:46] at what's yours
[1:26:48] stop looking at what Satan's lying to
[1:26:51] you about and look to the truth of God
[1:26:58] I'll say it again this Earth doesn't
[1:27:01] pertain to you
[1:27:04] physics doesn't pertain to you oh
[1:27:08] brother yes it does then how did the
[1:27:10] Disciples of old transform one place to
[1:27:12] another just like that
[1:27:14] he's like hey I want you to go over here
[1:27:16] there he was you know they have movies
[1:27:19] about time machines and people doing all
[1:27:21] that you know there's nothing new Under
[1:27:22] the heaven where do you think they got
[1:27:23] it the Bible said that it was happened
[1:27:25] years ago people traveled through like
[1:27:27] nothing why because God said I need you
[1:27:29] here and they were there
[1:27:32] no no none of that's new he's just
[1:27:34] perverting it making you think it's not
[1:27:37] real so you watch the movies and you do
[1:27:39] all this stuff and it takes those little
[1:27:41] sensors in your mind that should be
[1:27:43] telling you God can do that and it's
[1:27:46] actually telling you oh that's just
[1:27:47] stuff's nonsense
[1:27:48] it's not nonsense if God needed you 20
[1:27:51] years ago he's going to back you up and
[1:27:52] send you 20 years ago
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:57] anything's possible we got to stop
[1:28:00] thinking like the world and start
[1:28:02] thinking like God
[1:28:05] put in you the mind of Christ and in
[1:28:09] that mind anything and all things are
[1:28:13] possible
[1:28:14] but we let the world dictate what we
[1:28:17] believe and what we don't believe
[1:28:19] we let the world say this is nonsense or
[1:28:22] it's not nonsense
[1:28:25] like the little story
[1:28:27] they said about letting an adult and a
[1:28:29] child draw a horse
[1:28:31] the adult goes away I can't draw no
[1:28:34] horse that child just goes to whipping
[1:28:36] in a drawing and pulls up and he's got
[1:28:38] this Big Blob look at my horse
[1:28:40] just a blob of colors on a piece of
[1:28:41] paper
[1:28:43] but it didn't matter that child drew a
[1:28:45] horse because nobody said she couldn't
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:28:49] it's the same way with you
[1:28:52] you can go out to people and you can
[1:28:55] talk to them and
[1:28:56] bye to him and God can speak to you and
[1:28:59] through you and he can save people and
[1:29:02] he can heal people and he can do that
[1:29:06] but you have to believe you can
[1:29:10] the whole world says oh no no no no no
[1:29:12] no no no no you know that was that was
[1:29:14] from times past I was you know brother
[1:29:16] Branham you know he had a gift that was
[1:29:18] just you know that was him well you got
[1:29:20] the same gift
[1:29:22] oh no brother I'm not a prophet neither
[1:29:24] am I
[1:29:25] but he said
[1:29:28] he to the lay members of the church and
[1:29:30] I'll get the quote for you I have it at
[1:29:31] the house he said you can pray for the
[1:29:35] sick you can baptize people
[1:29:39] you can
[1:29:42] not just the ministers not just pastors
[1:29:44] or evangelists or missionaries you can't
[1:29:47] you can pray for the sick brother
[1:29:49] and guess what will happen
[1:29:51] to be healed
[1:29:55] the world says oh no no no no no no
[1:29:57] forget
[1:29:59] that and when I say the world you'd be
[1:30:01] surprised at how much of that comes
[1:30:04] right into our churches
[1:30:07] well it's just like anything else your
[1:30:10] upbringing the way you raise the things
[1:30:11] you learn the things you do you come
[1:30:13] together as a group of people the
[1:30:14] majority will outweigh the whatever okay
[1:30:17] so if you got half of the people coming
[1:30:21] in bringing in their upbringing bringing
[1:30:23] in their culture bringing in all this
[1:30:24] stuff and to them
[1:30:26] you know they were Baptists so healings
[1:30:29] and stuff was left back there
[1:30:32] guess what
[1:30:33] that's what's going to happen
[1:30:35] they believe it that way Oh They'll pray
[1:30:37] they'll say but deep down in their heart
[1:30:39] they're like well Lord help them
[1:30:43] and that ain't right
[1:30:45] when we pray for people we should
[1:30:47] believe it
[1:30:48] [Music]
[1:30:50] When you pray for someone you should
[1:30:52] really have in your heart that it's
[1:30:53] going to happen or why pray
[1:30:59] but you bring in someone like my grandma
[1:31:02] and she passed away many many years ago
[1:31:05] but I still remember
[1:31:07] not just like five or six years old when
[1:31:09] she passed away but I still remember
[1:31:11] because that little gal
[1:31:13] well maybe she wasn't so small but
[1:31:16] um I was little so I really can't tell
[1:31:18] but my grandma
[1:31:19] she would get up in church and that
[1:31:21] Spirit would hit and she would dance
[1:31:25] in the spirit
[1:31:26] up here
[1:31:28] not down here
[1:31:29] up here
[1:31:32] no screws holding no more abuse to the
[1:31:34] floor just wooden pews no pads on them
[1:31:37] no nothing no screws hold them to the
[1:31:38] floor
[1:31:39] and she danced up here
[1:31:42] why because nobody told her she couldn't
[1:31:46] so when the spirit moved and she felt
[1:31:48] like jumping up
[1:31:49] she jumped up gravity held nothing to
[1:31:52] her
[1:31:53] she danced on the back of a Pew and it
[1:31:54] never moved
[1:31:58] she would get in her kitchen cooking for
[1:31:59] Sunday meals and every single Sunday
[1:32:03] I mean there be people over family
[1:32:05] members not just church people we're
[1:32:07] talking into God family's huge so we're
[1:32:09] talking Mamie's house would be so full
[1:32:11] that she had an entire back porch that
[1:32:13] was nothing but a table
[1:32:14] and there would be people and for some
[1:32:16] odd reason she made all the men eat at
[1:32:18] the table and then the women and
[1:32:20] children had to wait
[1:32:21] and now they say that women talk a lot
[1:32:24] you get a table full of men together
[1:32:26] it's ours
[1:32:28] okay hours
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:31] and I would be so hungry because I'm
[1:32:33] just a little bitty guy right
[1:32:35] but grandma was in there
[1:32:37] sneaking me bits of food as she's
[1:32:38] cooking
[1:32:40] and then all of a sudden she starts
[1:32:41] singing ah flowey
[1:32:44] and her feet gets to moving and she's
[1:32:47] just a cookie and she's in that kitchen
[1:32:49] and she's singing I ain't gonna die nope
[1:32:52] I'm not I'm Gonna Fly and boy making up
[1:32:55] her own word and she's in there just to
[1:32:57] singing and you know what you could hear
[1:32:58] I was five years old but you know what I
[1:33:00] could hear
[1:33:02] foreign
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:05] those winds didn't just pick her up and
[1:33:07] Float around other
[1:33:10] nobody told her she couldn't find God in
[1:33:12] her kitchen
[1:33:14] nobody told her that she even though
[1:33:16] she's in there working herself her
[1:33:18] fingers to the Bone for all those guys
[1:33:20] out there cussing and smoking on her
[1:33:22] back porch no respect of course back
[1:33:24] then it was a little bit different
[1:33:25] anyway it was just normal
[1:33:28] but she's in there working away cooking
[1:33:30] none of the ladies helping her now maybe
[1:33:32] that was her own choice I don't know
[1:33:34] like I said I was young but she's in
[1:33:35] there cooking just to sing it
[1:33:39] change the whole ends I'd set up in
[1:33:42] there and I'd get other she had a big
[1:33:44] old huge teddy bear so right where her
[1:33:45] kitchen come out into the living room
[1:33:47] that big old huge teddy bear set like
[1:33:48] this so right on the edge of that
[1:33:50] kitchen I'd snuggle into that teddy bear
[1:33:51] and hide and she'd be in there just to
[1:33:53] singing in a cooking and she'd get
[1:33:55] something done and she'd hand it over
[1:33:56] that teddy bear and she'd get to cook
[1:33:58] and she'd hand it over that teddy bear
[1:34:00] in my mind I'm thinking why is she
[1:34:01] feeding the teddy bear well I'm Gonna
[1:34:02] Take It she was feeding me but I was
[1:34:05] five six years old
[1:34:06] beginning wonder if the teddy bear was
[1:34:08] real
[1:34:09] that was her just a singing and the
[1:34:12] dancing and God moving
[1:34:14] the whole time
[1:34:18] she wasn't in that kitchen
[1:34:21] she was in Heavenly places
[1:34:24] the spirit of God had lifted her so far
[1:34:26] up no wonder the food tasted so good no
[1:34:29] wonder Grandma's cooking was so good
[1:34:31] you want to know why Grandma's cooking
[1:34:33] was so good because the spirit cooked it
[1:34:35] while she was in the ovens
[1:34:40] hey she sure wasn't there paying no
[1:34:42] attention she was twirling around
[1:34:44] dancing singing all them old hymns he
[1:34:49] abides he abide and then she gets to
[1:34:52] dancing and she was elderly you know so
[1:34:55] she couldn't really do it a lot but the
[1:34:56] more she got into it the more she danced
[1:34:58] mom come around the corner my mom
[1:35:01] talking to my grandma come around the
[1:35:03] corner and say Mom
[1:35:05] we got people to feed
[1:35:08] yeah dear I'm cooking
[1:35:10] yo
[1:35:12] gone
[1:35:13] I'm not saying nothing bad about my mom
[1:35:14] she she'd do the same thing I'm just
[1:35:16] saying at that particular moment grandma
[1:35:19] was in Heavenly places
[1:35:21] my mom was worried about getting the men
[1:35:24] Fed so that she could get the women Fed
[1:35:26] so that they could get the children fed
[1:35:28] that's what my mom was worried about my
[1:35:30] grandma
[1:35:31] was worried about God
[1:35:34] you see the difference
[1:35:36] we are not earth-bound creatures
[1:35:40] and if you put God first the meal to get
[1:35:42] done because I don't remember not one
[1:35:44] time that there wasn't any food left for
[1:35:47] the last child d
[1:35:51] and there was a lot of us
[1:35:54] I mean a lot
[1:35:56] so much so that I'd be hanging out with
[1:35:58] the kids and I couldn't even tell you
[1:36:00] half of my cousin's names
[1:36:05] you know it's the truth but my favorite
[1:36:08] place
[1:36:10] snuggle up next to that teddy bear
[1:36:13] our grandma was singing
[1:36:17] because she Lifted Me
[1:36:20] into Heavenly places
[1:36:22] and now I want to say this and then I'm
[1:36:24] going to let you go
[1:36:28] things changed in my life things happen
[1:36:29] all of a sudden I end up I wake up after
[1:36:32] well too much stuff let me put it that
[1:36:35] way
[1:36:36] and I'm looking at 21 years in prison
[1:36:39] sitting on the floor
[1:36:41] wondering myself what in the world am I
[1:36:45] going to do
[1:36:46] what can I do
[1:36:48] I know Dad
[1:36:50] you know dad always told me if I ended
[1:36:52] up in here he's going to make me stay
[1:36:53] and he did for a little bit but then he
[1:36:55] helped me get out
[1:36:56] he made me sweat it though he really
[1:36:58] made me sweat it
[1:37:00] but anyways I'm in there thinking what
[1:37:02] in the world can I do in here
[1:37:04] I'm scared out of my mind I'm a what was
[1:37:07] a little bitty guy stood six foot tall
[1:37:10] weighed probably 130 pounds I mean I was
[1:37:13] little when April and I started dating I
[1:37:16] was 19 weighed what 140. we got married
[1:37:19] I only weighed 150. I mean I was a
[1:37:21] little bitty guy and I'm looking around
[1:37:24] me and these guys were huge
[1:37:28] I was scared
[1:37:30] but then I remembered
[1:37:32] Grandma I was like hmm
[1:37:36] I was like well Lord I don't know if
[1:37:37] this is going to work or not
[1:37:39] I don't know you
[1:37:40] haven't talked to you in years
[1:37:43] I was going through my head I thought
[1:37:44] Lord I know but right now
[1:37:46] if you don't come down in here I'm in
[1:37:48] some serious trouble
[1:37:50] foreign
[1:37:54] [Music]
[1:37:55] I could feel the same wind
[1:37:59] I could feel the same exact atmosphere
[1:38:02] coming in there and you know what's
[1:38:05] crazy I ain't the only one who felt it
[1:38:09] my buddy Chris that went in there with
[1:38:11] me like calling my boy yeah let's call
[1:38:13] him my buddy
[1:38:14] just leave that alone too he was in
[1:38:17] there too he kept doing this
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:22] I was like man what's the matter with
[1:38:23] you he's like I don't know
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:27] I don't know I feel weird I was like
[1:38:28] well I ain't stopping at any time
[1:38:32] oh I'll Fly Away doll you know been to
[1:38:35] church my whole life but for some reason
[1:38:37] I can only remember versus I'll Fly Away
[1:38:39] and hear about it
[1:38:41] never was real good with words I guess
[1:38:43] but I'm just laying in there in my mind
[1:38:44] I'm humming Lord what am I going to do
[1:38:47] I'm an adult now
[1:38:48] it ain't like this is childish stuff
[1:38:50] this ain't going on my record getting
[1:38:52] sealed
[1:38:53] I'm in trouble Lord I don't know where
[1:38:55] to go and I don't know what to do he
[1:38:57] buys he abides
[1:39:00] all of a sudden the biggest guy in the
[1:39:01] room comes over to me he says hi
[1:39:05] he gave me his name and I don't remember
[1:39:07] his name I laugh and they call him Bubba
[1:39:10] just because but he had an actual name
[1:39:13] but anyways he shook my hand he said
[1:39:14] nice to meet you so nice to meet you too
[1:39:16] he said well I'm out of here in a couple
[1:39:17] weeks he said her month or so he said he
[1:39:20] said so we're just going to stick
[1:39:21] together you and me
[1:39:23] I was like oh boy
[1:39:26] you know I was like this it's like well
[1:39:28] all right it's not like I'm big enough
[1:39:30] to say anything about it
[1:39:33] and you know what nobody there bothering
[1:39:35] me
[1:39:36] he didn't bother me just the fact that
[1:39:38] he was sitting next to me everybody else
[1:39:39] stayed away
[1:39:40] we'd come out to the table to eat and
[1:39:42] not have my meal in front of me they'd
[1:39:44] be knocking other people's meals off the
[1:39:46] table doing all sorts of stuff never one
[1:39:48] time
[1:39:49] did they touch mine
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:56] that's God it wasn't him sitting next to
[1:39:58] me God put him next to me so when you
[1:40:01] look back on that you see God moving
[1:40:02] even when you ain't
[1:40:04] I wasn't serving God didn't even want to
[1:40:06] but I didn't make a promise to God and I
[1:40:09] made a promise to my dad I was like you
[1:40:11] get me out of here well I'll never go
[1:40:13] back
[1:40:14] that much I guarantee you get me out of
[1:40:17] here I'll never go back
[1:40:19] but then that wasn't even me that kept
[1:40:21] that promise
[1:40:24] well it couldn't have been me because
[1:40:26] because I'm a year out
[1:40:27] on
[1:40:28] supposed to be home
[1:40:31] and taking her out of the house don't do
[1:40:33] that
[1:40:34] it's not good
[1:40:36] the point being is I didn't keep myself
[1:40:38] from going up for 21 years
[1:40:41] God kept me from going up 21 years
[1:40:45] because I'm not Earthly bound
[1:40:48] and when I can look toward him and say
[1:40:50] God forgive me
[1:40:52] I no longer have a tie to this earth I
[1:40:56] am no longer a liar I was no longer born
[1:40:59] in sin shaped in iniquity when I can
[1:41:01] look and accept him as my savior and say
[1:41:04] Lord forgive me all ties to this Natural
[1:41:07] Earth disappeared
[1:41:12] so everything that you have need of you
[1:41:15] have
[1:41:16] and it's all heavenly
[1:41:19] so stop looking down
[1:41:23] and start looking up
[1:41:26] because we really ought to be so
[1:41:28] Heavenly minded we ain't a liquor
[1:41:29] Earthly good foreign
[1:41:32] I believe that with everything that's in
[1:41:34] me brothers and sisters look up your
[1:41:36] redemption's coming
[1:41:38] the rapture's here
[1:41:40] the whole end of this thing's coming
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:44] I I personally don't want to be left for
[1:41:46] the foolish
[1:41:49] you know I want to be the one that woke
[1:41:50] up and trimmed my lamp and said Lord
[1:41:53] come quickly
[1:41:54] that's the one I want to be
[1:41:57] and that's the one we can be if we'll
[1:41:59] stop holding ourself
[1:42:01] to this earth
[1:42:04] the winds have changed
[1:42:07] the pressure in the trials are pushing
[1:42:09] you upward let it push you into the
[1:42:12] heavens let's stand
[1:42:14] [Music]
[1:42:23] I know that seemed maybe a little choppy
[1:42:25] and
[1:42:26] [Music]
[1:42:28] but when it started going through my
[1:42:30] head
[1:42:30] I'm telling you God drove that trope
[1:42:33] because there ain't no way I would drive
[1:42:34] it
[1:42:35] and you can ask my wife I come walking
[1:42:37] in the door of the house
[1:42:39] singing and a preaching I didn't even
[1:42:41] get two steps in the door and I had a
[1:42:43] whole congregation in there because I
[1:42:44] had them preaching away
[1:42:47] because it dawned on me
[1:42:50] I ain't of this world
[1:42:54] nothing that I have done
[1:42:56] pertains to me
[1:42:59] you realize that
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:02] when you take the records of Heaven
[1:43:05] and you look through God's record and
[1:43:06] you flip through it he never even sees
[1:43:10] me in that cell
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:15] so everything that I think I know
[1:43:19] really ain't true
[1:43:24] oh now brother I know you were there
[1:43:26] your mom told me she went and seen you
[1:43:28] there you're there no I prove it
[1:43:33] but you prove it by God's standards
[1:43:36] don't prove it by some Earthly thing
[1:43:39] prove to me I did it by God
[1:43:42] [Music]
[1:43:44] and now I'm not trying to be high Mighty
[1:43:45] because I'll never forget where I came
[1:43:47] from I know where God brought me from
[1:43:49] and I know where he's taking me and I
[1:43:51] will forever love him and be grateful
[1:43:54] for the things that he's done for me but
[1:43:56] I have got to stop letting that hold me
[1:43:58] here
[1:44:00] foreign
[1:44:01] because it's as though I never did it
[1:44:06] well
[1:44:07] how far
[1:44:09] is the how's that goal the city of God's
[1:44:12] forgetfulness you know how how big is it
[1:44:13] from as far as the East is
[1:44:18] from One Nail scarred hand
[1:44:20] to the other one
[1:44:23] and that is suspended in the heavens
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:30] oh brothers and sisters I'm gonna let it
[1:44:32] go
[1:44:33] I hope you can understand the winds have
[1:44:36] changed the our anointing is no longer
[1:44:39] holding us down our anointing is lifting
[1:44:42] us above this world
[1:44:47] cars don't matter finances don't matter
[1:44:50] houses don't matter God will provide you
[1:44:52] everything you need
[1:44:54] everything
[1:44:58] praise the Lord what are we singing
[1:45:00] brother I'm I want to
[1:45:02] quit
