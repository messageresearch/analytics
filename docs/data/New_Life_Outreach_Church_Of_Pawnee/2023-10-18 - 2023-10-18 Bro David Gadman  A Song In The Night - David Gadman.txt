midst of the valley in the midst of the hurt in the midst of brother the Joe the pain praise His name amen there ought to be a song upon our our lips in the night time in the good and the bad it's one of my favorite songs was thinking of about today been going through a little trial and the Lord spoke to me today when everything falls apart praise His name when you have a broken heart just lift your hands and say that greater is he that is with is it within us tonight than he that's in the world Amen as thinking of this song as well what here we in as we turn it to our pastor F God wants to hear you sing when the waves are crashing around you when the fiery DS around you and despair it's all you see God wants to hear your voice when the wisest man has spoken says your circumstance is as hopeless as can be that's when God can we go uper key and do verse one you see there ch were fast in tight down at the gy that night still Paul and silence would not be dismay thank you Lord you said it's time to lift our voice sing praises to our Lord let's prove that we will trust him come what may God wants to hear a sing God wants to hear you sing when the waves are crashing around [Music] you [Music] that's he loves to hear you sing he loves to hear you sing when you're when he's blessed you he loves to hear you sing praise His name and being grateful but I do think that he he really loves to hear you in those hard times when it's nothing but Faith there's no emotion there's nothing there's nothing left doctors are against you everything's against you and and then there's something way down deep inside that that starts bubbling out of you and then it's not your deter mination or it's not any you have nothing left and then that's when something from the inner man just kicks in and I think he really gets a lot of Praise he gets a lot of Praise out of [Music] that I I believe somewhere in the scripture where it says that he he bottles the Saints or the prayers of the Saints the tears of the Saints amen there's something about that that when we love him despite the situation I'm serving him because I love him how about you tonight do you love him amen it's like my girl amen when I said I do I me it and I love her Hallelujah that doesn't mean that she's smiling at me all the time or she's proud of me all the time amen but I love her and and and that's the way a relationship between you and God I love the Lord Jesus Christ and he loves me amen what a delight to have brother and sister gadman with us and we love Brother David and Sister Laura amen and um I'm

it you know but anyway we'll try not to hold you too long but I was thinking when brother uh wend was saying something about brother belly Paul and his testimony I remember the first time I ever heard his testimony 1971 okay I just a small boy about 10 years old January 1971 Jasper Texas brother Clark was a pastor there in Jasper Texas and he invited Billy Paul and Brother Joseph and they brother Billy Paul gave his testimony and I don't know what happened I'd like to had that on uh you know MP3 or something and my dad had you know them big real reals and everything my dad had it and I don't know wherever happened he had a lot of stuff that I don't have somehow it got lost in their moves or whatever but how many remembers them real to reals amen so some of the younger folks don't remember them somebody was saying hey somebody somebody was telling me that he wanted to find one said Brother David all your travels and stuff you had find one let me know said I like to cuz he said I got one a real to real I like to bring it play it to the church so the young people know what you know what we used to have to go through to listen amen so we appreciate the Lord tonight amen now the singing I tell you what I don't know if brother Kobe Sister Mary and all them looked at my notes but my I believe I'm in the right direction tonight so you just help me pull from the gift tonight job the 35th chapter 10th verse says but none saith where is God my maker who giveth songs in the night May the Lord add His blessings to the WR word you may be seated I'd like to turn to another scripture and I don't know I guess people pronounce it habac or something like that the third chapter and the 17th verse and I I and if you got a scull field it'd be well you'll have to find it cuz I didn't write down the page number there but it's in there and I guess that's how you pronounce it but I want to read from the third chapter the 17th to the 19th verse and it says although although the Fig Tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olives shall fail and the field shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the Stalls yet will I rejoice in the Lord I will joy in the god of my salvation the Lord is my strength and he will make my feet like H's feet and he will make me to walk upon my high places may the Lord add His blessings to reading the word I like to take for a thought a song in the night a song in the night now we all go through uh troubles Amen brother brother Kobe was mentioning so I thought my he might have he probably looked at my notes or something but I said we all go through troubles I was talking to a brother last night it seems like every time you turn around brother wend everybody's texting and say you got to pray for this one pray for this one pray for this one this one quit this one gave up this one done that and every one of us tonight has got some kind of trouble or trial or battle that we're going through am I right am and so we're going through that but I tell you what it's God that gives a song we can't sing sometimes when we're going through trouble and trials unless God gives a song oh and he's the one that's got to give it amen oh you know what me you know what people's problems are men's problems are we put it all one category many men are terribly tormented because they focus on their troubles amen we focus on our troubles we focus on our trials we focus on our distress we focus on our fears right there's a lot of fears uh I I I there an archive brother Donnie here a several uh uh weeks ago and he's preaching on that that uh we should uh be free from all fear you know it's just the devil wants to put fear and torment in our life but you look it up and I I I just Googled it and there's a lot of fears you know and they got so many uh names for Phobia so iophobia and and and uh that's I think that's afraid of spids or whatever there's so many fears and we we fear and we we focus our our get our focus and our mind on on that our fears our troubles our torments yeah and we begin to look within ourselves to escape their TR to escape our troubles but we can't look unto ourselves cuz within us there's no hope within us there's nothing in us that we can do or say or or Escape our troubles and our trials and our torments see what we do what we need to do is we forget to look to the hills when all will Help Cometh cuz Psalm psalmist 121 in the chapter 121 verse1 says I will lift up my eyes unto the heels from which cometh my help oh my what do they do not say where is God my maker who giveth me songs in the night amen oh it's God that gives us songs amen you know it's all all we we all can sing during the daytime right when things are when we when our cup is full we can sing Hallelujah when wealth grows in we can praise God when our bank account is full we can praise God when everybody's happy Mama's happy Daddy's happy the kids are happy we can praise God right but when everything is going wrong that's where the where we have a problem sometimes that's where like Sister Mary was saying amen when I feel like I can't go on that's when I got to praise the Lord that's when I got to lift my hands up and say God I love you God I appreciate you I thank you Lord for letting allow me to see what I see in this hour that I'm living in I thank you for salvation I thank you for the Holy Ghost amen all of us can sing like I said during the day well rows in we can praise God he gives us a Bountiful Harvest our sins are us ships that are fully loaded we can praise them but what about when the hard times are amen what about when there's no food on the table amen we don't know where the next meal's coming from but I want to tell you my God's a provider tonight hallelujah amen I tell you what I have every many ever heard Chimes and now how can you how you can't hear them unless the winds are blowing right that's when they give the most beautiful music is when the winds are blowing hallelujah oh what about me and you tonight amen we may have storms in our life the wind may be blowing but it's a time to chime hallelujah oh that's the time oh the times whisper music when the wind winds blow it's difficult to make music when there is no wind Hallelujah when there ain't no trouble that's when it's difficult amen oh we can praise him when everything's going all right uh amen like I said when everybody's happy but when we ain't happy when we're going through hell and high water that's the time to raise our hands and praise God hallelujah oh my when there is amen it's easy to sing when we can read the notes by daylight but one is skillful who sings from his heart I want it to come from my heart tonight amen I want it to come I don't want it just to be something that hey just that I'm going through the motions or something that hey that just because I've been taught Amen to raise my you know what it is we're taught we're like puppets amen we when when the preacher says say amen that's when you say Amen when he says praise the Lord that's that's when you praise the Lord when he say raise your hands that's when you raise your hands but it shouldn't be that way amen we should raise our hands when we don't feel like raising our hands we should say Amen when we don't feel like saying amen oh that's the way to give the devil a black eye when we don't feel like praising God when we don't feel like coming to church when we don't feel like doing this that's when we need to give it her

when we're going through trouble it's not in our power to to sing when we think everybody's against us in the church it's not in our power to raise our hands it's not in our power to do this oh but it's when he comes along and he gives us a song see it's see what did the prophet God say he said what did he say he said what was God in the beginning he wasn't even God what is God an object of worship and in the beginning he didn't have nobody to worship him he just dwelt alone the El him the all sufficient one amen he he just dropped along with his thoughts and in his thoughts he had a plan oh Hallelujah I'm so glad that in the from the beginning from the foundation of the world before there was ever an Adam or molecule I was with him in his thoughts and if I was with him in his thoughts I'll always be with him Hallelujah so he created the angels and they begin to worship holy holy around but you know what that was just going through the motions they didn't know what it was like but in in him the prophet of God said he had an attribute to be a father to be a savior to be a Healer to be all these things to be a deliverer but nobody was lost so he couldn't display his attribute as a savior nobody was sick so he couldn't display his attribute as being a [Music] Healer amen oh amen and because all this to fall and you we won't get in all that but the fall in the garden and all that and now he could express his thoughts of being a Healer being a deliverer being a savior Hallelujah see the strength of the vessel can only be demonstrated only by the hurricane is

as Christians is subjected to some fiery tribe amen when we're going through a fiery trial that's when the power of God can be made manifest amen unless we're going through a trial unless we're going he cannot manifest us as a deliverer himself as a deliverer unless we go through a trial amen unless we get sick he cannot manifest himself as a Healer amen oh ain't you glad that every now and then he lets us go through trials and temptations and struggles that's just God's way of showing that he loves us amen hallelujah hallelujah oh my see if God would make it manifest the fact that he does
