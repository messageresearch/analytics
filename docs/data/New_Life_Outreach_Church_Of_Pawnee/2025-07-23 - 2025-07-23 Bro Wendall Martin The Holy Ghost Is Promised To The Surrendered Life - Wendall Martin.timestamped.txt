[34:07] Jesus. Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[34:10] Father, we just want to thank you today
[34:11] for for your love and Lord what it means
[34:15] to to know you and to serve you. I I
[34:20] pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would
[34:24] would just come real special among us
[34:27] Lord because that is the reason we come
[34:30] Lord is is to Lord be in your presence
[34:34] and to hear your words but Lord not just

[34:40] but for you to speak directly to us and
[34:44] and and and anoint our hearts to
[34:46] understand. Father, we're just asking
[34:49] that you would do that. And Lord, we
[34:51] just look to you in the name of the Lord
[34:54] Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen?
[34:58] &gt;&gt; And amen. Praise the Lord.
[35:02] Uh if we could I don't know maybe if we
[35:04] had a little bit of highs on this or
[35:06] something. It just feels like it's it's
[35:08] real um got too much lows or something.
[35:11] Amen. appreciate these guys uh uh
[35:15] working on get getting this new system
[35:17] all all up and going. And uh
[35:23] Josh has been working on my deal all
[35:24] night. My and uh
[35:28] Josh has been working on my deal all
[35:30] night. My uh my my earpiece, it wasn't
[35:32] working. So,
[35:35] brother
[35:37] Caleb is
[35:39] and it's
[35:41] on on this kind of a mic. It just once
[35:44] it's just hard to get them set up and uh
[35:47] so we appreciate your patience with us
[35:50] as we're getting it. But tonight I want
[35:52] to speak on on this um
[35:56] uh on a on a subject of the promise of
[36:00] the Holy Ghost to the surrendered life.
[36:04] So we've been preaching a lot on
[36:06] surrender and what it means to
[36:08] surrender. Um
[36:11] but the the uh Holy Spirit, we're
[36:16] surrendering our lives for a reason, not
[36:19] to become a not not just become a
[36:23] religious person,
[36:24] &gt;&gt; but we're surrendering our lives so that
[36:27] the Holy Spirit can move on the inside
[36:30] of us. So, amen. There there is so the
[36:34] Christian walk is is is is uh com
[36:39] comprised of of three elements. Amen.
[36:42] The surrender and that's when the just
[36:45] we're justified. It's when God looks
[36:47] down upon us. Amen. And it's like uh
[36:50] it's it's it's it's like you have uh uh
[36:53] I don't know if you were to find uh your
[36:55] your precious glass that that you've
[36:57] always or your cup that you've always
[36:59] drunk coffee out of and you've lost it
[37:02] and u and then you find it. One of the
[37:05] kids have taken it out and they've been
[37:08] uh out there in the in in the chicken
[37:10] coupe with it and they've been uh it's
[37:12] all in the barnyard and it's it's got it
[37:15] is just absolutely nasty. Amen. And so
[37:19] in order to redeem that cup, you have
[37:22] got to go. Amen. And you have got to
[37:26] you've got to pick it up. Amen. That's
[37:28] justification. That's when God comes to
[37:31] you and and searching for you and and
[37:34] and he finds the you find the cup. Amen.
[37:39] But now you're you're not going to put
[37:40] no coffee in that. You're you're not
[37:42] going to drink out of that. Amen. You
[37:45] cannot use it for its intended purpose
[37:48] because it is it is full of chicken
[37:50] manure and it's full of barnyard stuff
[37:54] and Amen. So what you do, Amen. you pick
[37:57] it up and you take it into your house
[38:00] into your sink and you start washing it.
[38:03] That is sanctification. That's when
[38:05] that's that's when you you start putting
[38:07] detergent on it and cleaning it all up
[38:10] and and making sure that it is all
[38:12] sanitary. But still, that is not the
[38:15] finished product. That is not what Amen.
[38:19] You you you you didn't just do it to go
[38:21] set it up uh uh uh uh to look at it, but
[38:24] it was created for you to drink coffee
[38:27] out of. It was created for you to use.
[38:31] So the third process, amen, is for you
[38:34] to take that cup, fill it up with the
[38:37] goodness, Amen, and and drink out of it.
[38:40] So God in his mind, his purpose for
[38:44] saving you is to redeem you. He had to
[38:47] look throughout all of the barnyard. And
[38:50] God looked down and found that that
[38:54] individual that he knew before the
[38:56] foundation of the world that he loved
[38:58] before the foundation of the world.
[39:00] Amen. And he he chose you. He picked you
[39:03] up. He brings you into the church. And
[39:06] he Amen. He begins to clean you up. And
[39:09] you used to be a maybe a womanizer or
[39:12] maybe you was a harlot or maybe you were
[39:15] uh uh amen alcoholic or a drug addict.
[39:18] But God begins to clean you up. Amen.
[39:22] And wash you and by his blood and the
[39:25] word that is being preached. I want to
[39:27] tell you there's something about the
[39:29] gospel. Every time you come to church
[39:31] and the gospel is being preached, you
[39:34] there is a amen. There is a cleansing
[39:37] agent. The Bible says that we are washed
[39:40] with the washing of the water by the
[39:42] word of God. Amen. And we're washed by
[39:45] his word. What is God doing? He is
[39:48] washing you, cleaning you up, restoring
[39:52] you back to what you were created for in
[39:55] the beginning. Well, glory to God. His
[39:58] desire is to fill you up. His desire is
[40:02] to his glory to come on the inside of
[40:06] you. Amen. and and and and live in you
[40:10] and live his life through you, manifest
[40:13] himself through you. That's what his
[40:16] desire is all about. Amen. He wants to
[40:19] live in you.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Now, if you if you noticed here in this
[40:24] scripture that we have that that we've
[40:26] just read, he he he says we we in time
[40:29] past walked according to the course of
[40:32] this world. Amen. according to the
[40:35] prince of the power of there the spirit
[40:37] that now works inside
[40:40] amen the children of disobedience. He
[40:43] says we also had our conversation our
[40:45] lifestyle in the same amen. We were we
[40:48] were once uh uh uh we we were once
[40:52] children of the devil if if you want to
[40:55] put it that way. But then it was God who
[40:58] was rich in mercy because God knew that
[41:01] he had lost a cup and he was looking for
[41:03] that cup and he was going to find that
[41:06] cup. And when he does find that cup,
[41:08] he's going to pull that cup. Amen. And
[41:10] bring it back into where? Into his
[41:12] house. Well, glory to God. Amen. That's
[41:15] right. So, I want to speak on the Holy
[41:17] Ghost. And Amen. And and it it spirits,
[41:21] evil spirits and good spirits both have
[41:24] got to have a a body to work through.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So there there are How
[41:32] many believes in demon possession?
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. There's demon possession
[41:38] there where devils enter into to a man.
[41:41] We've seen it all throughout the the the
[41:43] the New Testament. The maniac that was
[41:46] out there. Amen. and he was filled with
[41:48] w with with a legion of devils and and
[41:51] and it and it and it caused him to act
[41:54] ways. Threw him in the fire. It it
[41:56] caused him to leave his family. It was
[41:58] living among the tombs. Amen. But you
[42:01] see, there's got to be Amen. God is a
[42:05] spirit. Amen. And he's a Holy Spirit.
[42:08] That's what God is. He is the Holy
[42:10] Spirit. And the Holy Spirit has got to
[42:14] have a body to live in. That's what God
[42:17] created Adam for is so that he would
[42:20] have a body to live in. Amen. And that
[42:22] he could uh uh uh work his work here on
[42:25] the earth. But now Satan, the devil, the
[42:28] spirits, demons are are evil spirits.
[42:31] But when we come to Christ there in
[42:34] Colossians 1:13, it says, "Who hath
[42:37] delivered us from the power of darkness
[42:42] and hath translated us into the kingdom
[42:45] of his dear son." I like the way the
[42:47] amplified version says it. It says, "For
[42:49] he has rescued us and drawn us to
[42:53] himself from the dominion of darkness
[42:56] and has transferred us into the kingdom
[42:59] of his beloved son.
[43:02] Hallelujah. We're
[43:07] &gt;&gt; now it is God working through us.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; He's rescued us. He brought us. God
[43:14] create God never did create you to be a
[43:17] sinner.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, the devil never
[43:20] did on you. God's always had you. You
[43:23] were born in a chicken pin just like the
[43:26] ju just just like the uh uh the little
[43:29] eaglet. Amen. You know, the as the
[43:31] farmer was was missing an egg for a
[43:33] second and and and he goes out and he
[43:35] finds this this eagle egg and he and he
[43:38] and he puts it in there with the other
[43:40] eggs and the and and the the hen is
[43:43] there and and and sitting on the eggs
[43:45] and and hatched the eggs. Amen. And and
[43:48] and the little eaglet hatched right
[43:51] along with the wi with all the chickens.
[43:54] Praise the Lord.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and wherever mama went, all of
[43:58] those little chicks went with them. at
[44:00] wherever mama went. And so did that
[44:02] little eaglet. That little eaglet was
[44:04] just following around wherever mama went
[44:06] all through the barnyard. But you see,
[44:08] it was never a chicken. It was always an
[44:14] eagle.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; We were born in sin. But God, Bible says
[44:19] that your name was put on the lamb's
[44:22] book of life when
[44:24] &gt;&gt; not when you come and gave your heart to
[44:26] the Lord.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Not when you decided to serve the Lord.
[44:29] The Bible says that if you're saved, if
[44:32] you ever make it to heaven, your name
[44:35] was put on God's book before the world
[44:38] ever began.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Well, pray. You mean you mean I was
[44:43] always a child of God, even while I was
[44:46] out there sinning? Yes, you were.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; You were always a son of God. You were
[44:52] always a daughter of God. You just
[44:55] didn't know who you were.
[44:58] Well, praise the name of the Lord.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. But one day, mama knew that she
[45:02] had two eggs. Mama knew she had two eggs
[45:05] and one of them had missing and mama was
[45:07] still looking around. And one day as she
[45:09] come, Amen. And she looked down and she
[45:11] saw that little eagllet in that chicken
[45:13] pin. Amen. Scratching scratching on the
[45:16] ground like all of the other chickens
[45:18] were. And she let out a great big
[45:21] scream. And when she let out that
[45:23] scream, that little eiglet, Amen. It it
[45:26] it it recognized, wait a minute, there
[45:29] is a call. Amen. As the scripture would
[45:32] say, a deep calling unto the deep. Amen.
[45:36] And that little that little eaglet
[45:37] looked up and and could you imagine that
[45:40] little eagllet sing this great majestic
[45:44] bird, his mama. Amen. That was that was
[45:47] flying around above that that barnyard.
[45:50] Now, those other chickens did not have
[45:53] any inkling of what was going on. Amen.
[45:56] They didn't care about that scream, but
[45:58] there was something about that little
[46:01] eiglet. It was an eagllet at heart.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; It always was an eagle. Can you say
[46:09] amen?
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And mama began to scream and
[46:13] before you know it, that little chicken
[46:15] got or that little eagle got discontent
[46:17] and says, "I don't belong in this
[46:18] barnyard. I am not a chicken. I am I I I
[46:23] don't like this kind of food. I belong
[46:25] up in the heavenlies just like my
[46:27] mother. And he come to his senses and he
[46:29] begin to flap those wings. Amen. And
[46:32] maybe he went up to the to to the fence
[46:34] post. Amen. And mama kept on a screaming
[46:37] and and maybe he went on up to the to
[46:39] the pinnacle of the barn and mama just
[46:41] kept on a screaming. And finally he got
[46:43] the courage and just kept on a flying
[46:46] and he joined mama up in the skies where
[46:49] he belonged. Now, he never did belong in
[46:54] that chicken pin,
[46:56] &gt;&gt; but he was he was still hatched there.
[46:58] Can you say amen?
[47:00] &gt;&gt; You never did belong a sinner.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Yet, you had your marriages messed up.
[47:08] Yet, you've had this and you've had
[47:10] that. Some in and out of jail. You've
[47:12] you've gone through this. You've fall
[47:13] with addictions. You've gone through
[47:15] Amen. Maybe it was a religious spirit in
[47:17] you. You were you you were a Catholic or
[47:20] a Pentecostal. Amen. All of your life or
[47:22] what. But finally there come a reality.
[47:25] I need a living God. How many needs a
[47:29] living God?
[47:30] &gt;&gt; There came something in your heart. I
[47:33] need something that's real. I was
[47:35] created for a purpose.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, you were created for a purpose. It
[47:41] was God's purpose.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; God put you here on the earth for a
[47:44] specific purpose.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; So there's where man God's created our
[47:51] hearts
[47:52] &gt;&gt; to hunger for God. Amen. The prophet
[47:55] would say David had said, "My soul longs
[47:59] for you like in a dry land where there's
[48:02] no water." Now God created man to have a
[48:05] thirst. It's your makeup. You were made
[48:08] to thirst. God made you that way. You
[48:11] can't help it if because you thirst. God
[48:14] made you to do it. But God made you to
[48:17] thirst after him. That thirst was put in
[48:20] you. Not to go to the devil's places,
[48:23] not to thirst after Hollywood or the
[48:25] fashions of the world, but that thirst
[48:28] was given to you to thirst after God.
[48:32] And I want you young people to
[48:33] understand that. Lots of lots of things
[48:35] out there to try to to pull you this way
[48:37] and that way. There going to be a lot of
[48:39] pretty girls, a lot of handsome guys,
[48:40] going to be a lot of Amen. a lot of
[48:42] things to try to attract your attention.
[48:44] But I want to say, remember, God created
[48:47] you with a divine purpose.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And Satan knows that. Satan knows that.
[48:54] And he'll begin to try to attract you to
[48:56] thirst after him and to fill your
[48:59] thirst. But I want to tell you, there is
[49:00] nothing that can that can quench your
[49:02] thirst like the Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; If you were an eagle to begin with,
[49:08] there's nothing in the barnyard that can
[49:10] satisfy you.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Well, come on. If you were a a son of
[49:16] God, well, oh, hallelujah.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's not no one could be
[49:22] my son except through through the
[49:25] through a a natural lineage or unless
[49:27] there was an adoption. Amen. There has
[49:29] to be something that is that is within
[49:33] within the nature of the father. It's
[49:35] never been the request of the of the
[49:39] sons,
[49:40] &gt;&gt; right? You weren't requesting to be your
[49:43] your dad's daughter. You didn't request
[49:46] to be your dad's daughter. Amen. It was
[49:50] your dad that took that on himself.
[49:53] Well, praise the name of the Lord. I
[49:55] didn't request to become a Christian. I
[49:58] didn't beg God to become Amen. to make
[50:01] me something. God loved me before I
[50:04] could ever love him. And he put my name
[50:08] in his book. Right.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; God chose me. Well, glory to God. And I
[50:16] want to tell you, you're not like one of
[50:17] those guys. I used to hate it when I was
[50:20] when when I was a kid, man. And we'd
[50:22] all, you know, we'd be collecting teams
[50:24] together for for for basketball or
[50:27] football or Hallelujah. And and they'd
[50:29] have the two captains, right? We still
[50:31] do that today. The two captains. And I
[50:34] was always the very last one.
[50:37] Hallelujah. And that didn't make me feel
[50:39] too proud. feel too good because I just
[50:42] not athletic. Hallelujah. And uh uh I I
[50:46] I I be there trying to look good and big
[50:49] and all that and and and they just would
[50:51] not pick me. I was the run. Amen. And I
[50:54] couldn't play ball if I wanted to.
[50:56] Hallelujah. Now, I could play a p or a
[50:58] guitar, but I sure couldn't play nothing
[51:00] else. And and but but you see, God's not
[51:03] here saying, "Hey, you know, you're
[51:04] having to say, "God, pick me. Pick me.
[51:06] Pick me." God loved you. Right?
[51:10] &gt;&gt; And there's no favorites in the kingdom
[51:12] of God.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; God so loved you that he gave himself
[51:18] for you.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; God's got a very special purpose. Amen.
[51:25] In in saving you today.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I I want us to keep that in mind
[51:30] that thirsting. You were born with a
[51:33] thirst. But you see, you were born in a
[51:36] fallen nature. And in this fallen
[51:38] nature, amen, you tried to quench that
[51:41] thirst through other things. The devil
[51:44] will get you to try to uh quench that
[51:46] thirst with pornography. He'll try to
[51:48] get you to quench that thirst through um
[51:50] a religion. He'll try to get you to quit
[51:53] quench your thirst through so many other
[51:55] things. But the reality is God gave us
[51:59] the thirst
[52:00] &gt;&gt; for more of him.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; To be like him. Can you say amen?
[52:06] Are you understanding?
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; So God made you to to desire to be like
[52:13] that. Amen. God did that because he
[52:16] wants to fill you up with his goodness.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; So when you were born, I want to say
[52:23] this again. When you were born, you were
[52:25] created with a place in you to be filled
[52:29] by God.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now, now Satan uh uh
[52:34] uh finds and tries to inhabit that man.
[52:37] And he and and and and even brother
[52:39] Brandon would talk about even in in
[52:40] church service, he says, "And when the
[52:42] meeting's going on, an evil spirit in
[52:44] the meeting," he said, "that spirit is
[52:45] almost harmless until it can catch
[52:48] somebody that it can work through.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Then when it can work, uh then when it
[52:52] can work through, it'll certainly do
[52:53] damage because it's an evil spirit." And
[52:56] the Holy Spirit is here right now, right
[52:59] now. trying to find somebody to work
[53:02] through. And when it finds somebody to
[53:04] work through, it can do good. See the
[53:06] two spirits and their motives and
[53:08] objectives. Watch how it is. Watch their
[53:10] works. Watch their fruits. Then you can
[53:13] see what spirit is on you. You are
[53:15] motivated by spirit.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now
[53:24] you I I want us to as I begin to think
[53:26] about the surrendered life and the
[53:29] receiving of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Now I
[53:32] I want us to to before Amen. Uh uh he or
[53:38] she can ever receive the Holy Ghost,
[53:42] you've got to die
[53:44] &gt;&gt; to yourself.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Now, how many knows what dying to
[53:46] yourself is? That that that doesn't mean
[53:49] go put a gun to your head.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; No, you've got to when I say when the
[53:54] Bible talks about dying to yourself,
[53:57] Amen. This means a surrender. This means
[54:01] giving everything that you think. Give
[54:04] it up and surrender it to the Lord.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; That that that means well I've got a
[54:10] really good idea. But if it's not what
[54:13] God's idea is, then we've got to surren
[54:16] that is dying to ourself.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Man wants
[54:22] to do things in the in their own way.
[54:24] But we've got to die. The Apostle Paul
[54:25] says, "I die daily." You've got to die
[54:29] to your old nature. Amen. You've got a
[54:32] sinful nature. You were born with that
[54:34] sinful nature. But when the when God
[54:36] comes, Amen. and begins to start working
[54:40] on you. It requires a surrendered life.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Now, with the cup that came out, it's
[54:47] already been picked up. It's brought in.
[54:49] Amen. To the sink. And I'm just going to
[54:51] put every one of you in the sink. Amen.
[54:53] Now, you're either going to allow God to
[54:56] clean you, make you, Amen. You're going
[54:59] to surrender to the Lord's word and let
[55:02] him scrub sin out of your life. And I
[55:05] want to tell you, there ain't nobody can
[55:06] do it any better than Jesus.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; There ain't nobody can do it any better
[55:10] than Jesus. Well, praise the Lord. I I
[55:13] go back to Sister Stephanie there. All
[55:15] those years as a heroin addict and all
[55:17] of those many times that she went
[55:19] through all of those 12step programs and
[55:21] all all of that money that was spent,
[55:24] all of that time. Amen. She went time
[55:26] after time after time. But when she came
[55:29] and surrendered her life to Jesus
[55:32] Christ, Jesus started cleaning her up.
[55:35] And I want to tell you, she's here
[55:36] tonight. Amen. A beautiful Christian.
[55:39] What God has done for her, what what
[55:42] done the difference. There's only one
[55:44] that can clean you up, and that's
[55:46] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; He cleans you up. Well, praise the Lord.
[55:51] You can go through the 12step program
[55:53] for an alcoholic all you want. Amen. But
[55:55] they don't even claim to you. Listen,
[55:57] when you go to those programs for for
[55:58] for for alcoholism, you know, you have
[56:01] every time you have to you when when you
[56:03] report for duty. Amen. You you all sit
[56:05] around in a circle and you all talk and
[56:07] I and if I were to go there, I would say
[56:10] this is the way it starts out. Hi, I'm
[56:12] Wendhol. I'm an alcoholic.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Why? They want you to admit that you've
[56:19] got an alcohol problem. Yeah.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; And and and they'll everyone there is
[56:24] not a program out there that'll tell you
[56:26] that you can be cured at. They teach you
[56:28] how to deal with alcoholism. They teach
[56:32] you how to deal with drug problem. But
[56:35] you see, God doesn't teach you how to
[56:38] deal with the devil. God comes in to set
[56:42] you free from the devil.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; He comes in to set you free from
[56:48] alcoholism.
[56:50] Oh, can you say amen? And the Bible says
[56:53] when whom Jesus sets free is free
[56:55] indeed.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; You're free. But it requires someone
[57:00] that is willing to admit that I don't
[57:03] have it going on. I don't have the world
[57:06] by the tail. I need Jesus.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you young people say,
[57:11] "Well, Amen. I've never been a sinner."
[57:13] Paul, you were born a sinner.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Every one of you kids were born sinners,
[57:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:19] Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why when when you even
[57:23] though you you you you're raised in a
[57:25] Christian home, you're raised in a
[57:28] Christian home, but yet Amen. you fight
[57:30] with desires, you fight with things
[57:34] lying, you fight with obedience, you
[57:36] fight with uh uh uh loving your your
[57:39] your your brother or your sister. It's
[57:41] in your nature. Sin is in your nature.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Right. But I'm so glad that God picks us
[57:49] up and God begins to wash us with his
[57:52] word.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; He be Oh, hallelujah. Amen. But the but
[57:56] the awesome thing is is the Holy Spirit
[57:59] will come back on you and he wants to
[58:03] live his life through every one of you.
[58:07] So coming to Jesus and sitting in church
[58:11] is not the end of the story. We must be
[58:14] we must receive the baptism of the Holy
[58:18] Ghost.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you just love it?
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you see, if you don't receive
[58:26] the Holy Ghost,
[58:28] then Amen. Let's just look here real
[58:31] quickly and and and I it's Matthew 12
[58:33] and 43. And let's just turn there
[58:35] because I I want I want us all to see
[58:37] it. And um
[58:42] praise the Lord. Matthew 12 and 43.
[58:49] Well, glory to God.
[58:52] Okay. So, so now we're talking about
[58:54] when God drives the spirits out, he's
[58:56] cleaning us up.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; He has favored us. And now he's cleaning
[59:00] us. Now, watch watch what watch what
[59:02] Jesus this is Jesus' own words. He says,
[59:06] "When the unclean spirit is gone out of
[59:09] a man, he walks through dry places
[59:12] seeking rest, finding none." Now, now,
[59:16] in other words, that devil that God has
[59:19] delivered you from is looking for a body
[59:23] that he can make havoc of.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; He can't make you do heroin anymore. So,
[59:29] he's got to find somebody.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; He's got to have a purpose. And it's
[59:34] destruction.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; He can't He can't make you lie anymore.
[59:37] So, he's got to find a body. The devil
[59:40] is powerless without a body.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Got to have a body to work through.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, watch. Then he says, "I will
[59:51] return unto into my house from whence I
[59:56] came out." And when he comes,
[1:00:00] he finds it empty and swept and
[1:00:05] garnished. So that devil that was that
[1:00:08] was driven out, he finds God does such a
[1:00:11] good job. He's cleaned it.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; It's empty. It's swept and it's just
[1:00:18] squeaky clean.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Now, this is an individual that the Holy
[1:00:23] Spirit has done a work in. All right.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Now watch watch the next verse.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; And then then he goes then goeth he and
[1:00:35] takes with him
[1:00:38] seven more spirits, seven other spirits
[1:00:42] more wicked than himself. And they enter
[1:00:46] in and dwell there. And the last state
[1:00:50] of that man is worse than the first.
[1:00:53] Even so shall it be also unto this
[1:00:56] wicked generation. So Jesus is saying
[1:01:00] God can do a work in someone's life.
[1:01:04] Drive the devils out.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Drive it all out. But if you if the Holy
[1:01:10] Spirit does not come in you, Jesus in
[1:01:13] another place says you there's got to be
[1:01:16] the strong man of the house. The strong
[1:01:19] man moves into that house and then the
[1:01:21] devil can't do anything to that
[1:01:24] individual. Who is the strong man?
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; It's God himself living in you.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Well, am I making sense?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; You see, so we don't want we don't want
[1:01:37] to just be cleaned. We don't want God to
[1:01:40] do and so many times I've seen it many
[1:01:42] many many times. God do such great
[1:01:44] things for an individual and because
[1:01:46] they get satisfied with where they are,
[1:01:49] Satan can come right back into that
[1:01:51] person and usually that person when they
[1:01:54] go out, they're they're they're many
[1:01:56] times worse than what they were at the
[1:01:57] beginning.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Why? It wasn't because they were bad
[1:02:02] people. It was because they did not go
[1:02:05] on to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody say justification.
[1:02:11] justification,
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; sanctification,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; see many think that you receive the Holy
[1:02:21] Ghost when you believe.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; That's not the case.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to read there in in
[1:02:28] let's look there in the book of uh Acts
[1:02:30] the 19th chapter,
[1:02:33] Acts 19 and one.
[1:02:37] Praise the Lord. Am I making sense?
[1:02:41] Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Now, Acts 19 and1
[1:02:46] and it came to pass that while Apollos
[1:02:48] was at Corinth, Paul having passed
[1:02:51] through the upper coast come into
[1:02:52] Ephesus finding certain disciples. Now,
[1:02:55] these are followers of Jesus. And he
[1:02:58] said unto them, "Have you received the
[1:03:02] Holy Ghost since you believed?" Now you
[1:03:05] say, "Well now, Brother Wendle, when I
[1:03:07] receive Jesus, when I've accepted, when
[1:03:11] I've surrendered my life to the Lord,
[1:03:13] isn't that the same as receiving the
[1:03:15] Holy Ghost?" Not according to scripture.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; It's a process.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. What's the three ingredients?
[1:03:25] What's the three ingredients to uh to to
[1:03:27] a birth?
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Water.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Blood.
[1:03:35] and spirit.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; There's a breaking of the water that
[1:03:39] well, praise the Lord.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; There is the blood and then there is the
[1:03:45] spirit.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; The baby is not alive though went
[1:03:50] through the blood of Jesus went through
[1:03:53] the water of baptism.
[1:03:56] It's not a birth until the baby is the
[1:04:02] spirit comes into that baby and that
[1:04:05] baby becomes a a living being.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:15] Now, if that baby if if that spirit is
[1:04:17] not in that baby, you can you can give
[1:04:20] that baby a little slap on the rump and
[1:04:22] it ain't going to do nothing because
[1:04:24] there ain't no life in that baby.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; So, we're not just wanting the blood of
[1:04:28] Jesus. We're not just wanting to be
[1:04:30] baptized, but we want the Holy Spirit to
[1:04:35] come upon us and give us a new birth.
[1:04:39] So, the Apostle Paul is asking these
[1:04:41] people, he's asking them, "Amen. H or
[1:04:45] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:04:47] you believe? You're you're a Christian.
[1:04:49] You're following after Jesus. And let's
[1:04:52] let's find out what he says. He says
[1:04:56] uh he said unto them, "Have you received
[1:04:58] the Holy Ghost since you believed?" And
[1:05:01] they said unto him, "We have not so much
[1:05:03] as heard whether there be any Holy
[1:05:05] Ghost." And he said unto them, "Unto
[1:05:07] what then were you baptized?" And they
[1:05:08] said, "Unto John's baptism." Then said
[1:05:10] Paul, John verily baptized unto
[1:05:13] repentance, saying unto the people that
[1:05:15] they should believe on him which should
[1:05:16] come after him, that is on Christ Jesus.
[1:05:19] And when they heard this, they were
[1:05:21] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:05:25] And when Paul laid his hands on them,
[1:05:28] the Holy Ghost came on them and they
[1:05:31] spake with tongues and prophesied. So,
[1:05:35] so these were believers, but they needed
[1:05:38] to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Now, some say, well, do do you uh uh do
[1:05:47] do you have to receive do do you have to
[1:05:50] speak in tongues when you receive the
[1:05:51] Holy Ghost? No. The scripture plainly
[1:05:54] says that there in the book of 1
[1:05:56] Corinthians the 12th chapter, he says,
[1:05:58] "Do all work miracles?" No. Are all
[1:06:02] apostles? No. Do all speak with tongues?
[1:06:05] No. He didn't put the nose in there.
[1:06:07] You're supposed to be doing the
[1:06:08] answering of that, right? Amen. So, he's
[1:06:10] saying that we do not all speak with
[1:06:13] tongues. There are people in this church
[1:06:14] here in this congregation that that have
[1:06:17] spoken tonesues when they received the
[1:06:18] Holy Ghost. There are some of you who
[1:06:21] have not spoke uh uh there's some of you
[1:06:24] that have spoken tonesues and there's
[1:06:25] some that have not spoken tongues and
[1:06:27] you've got the Holy Ghost. So, the
[1:06:29] tongues is not the evidence of the Holy
[1:06:31] Ghost. the the the evidence of having
[1:06:35] the Holy Ghost is that new birth. It's a
[1:06:38] living reality. Jesus is real in your
[1:06:42] life.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; You know when you've passed from death
[1:06:46] unto life.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Now, you still live in the same old
[1:06:50] body. Hallelujah. You still like ice
[1:06:53] cream. You still like sardines if you
[1:06:56] like sardines. You still like Amen. You
[1:06:58] still like all of those kinds of things.
[1:07:00] But the sin nature, you're no longer
[1:07:03] bound by sin. You're no longer craving
[1:07:08] sin. Now you're craving God. You're
[1:07:11] craving to please him. You're craving to
[1:07:15] satisfy him. And if you ever mess up,
[1:07:17] you're not one to try to hide it and
[1:07:19] say, "No, I'm not wrong." And no, no,
[1:07:21] no, no, no. You always want to be that
[1:07:23] kind of a of a man or a woman, boy, or
[1:07:26] girl that says, "I am wrong." Why?
[1:07:28] Because your desire is to please the
[1:07:30] Lord.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; You are a Christian.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:07:39] So, do you love him?
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we want that. Amen. We want
[1:07:45] we we want the old lap now. I I've quit
[1:07:49] my drinking. I quit my smoking. The
[1:07:51] Lord's helped me with this and he's
[1:07:53] helped me with that. And it is the Lord.
[1:07:57] Oh my. Don't ever think that you can
[1:07:59] quit anything. It's God. And don't let
[1:08:01] the devil tell you that. Lots of times
[1:08:04] the devil says, "See, well, God didn't
[1:08:06] really do anything in your life. You You
[1:08:07] just finally got enough willpower." No
[1:08:09] man has enough willpower to quit sin.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's the power of God in
[1:08:18] your life that is working in you.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Now, what is this? What is this Holy
[1:08:26] Spirit? Luke 24:49,
[1:08:29] "Behold, I send the promise of my father
[1:08:32] upon you."
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Tarry ye in the city of
[1:08:37] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:08:41] from on high."
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke wrote that. And then also
[1:08:44] Luke writes there in Acts 1:8, "But you
[1:08:47] shall receive power after that the Holy
[1:08:50] Ghost has come upon you, and you shall
[1:08:53] be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem,
[1:08:56] Judea, Samaria, and in the uttermost
[1:08:59] parts of the earth." I just want to say,
[1:09:01] folks, we ought to rejoice because we
[1:09:04] are so blessed.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. you you're blessed to receive the
[1:09:12] and I want to tell you there ain't two
[1:09:14] Holy Ghosts. Hallelujah. What they what
[1:09:18] they got on in the book of Acts is the
[1:09:20] same Holy Ghost we get today.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; It ain't changed. He's the same God.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; What God was there in the New Testament
[1:09:28] is what God is in the Old Test or or or
[1:09:30] in the church today. Can you say amen?
[1:09:32] He is. He's very much. You can receive
[1:09:36] the same baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:09:38] Devon, that that that Peter had, that
[1:09:40] Peter received, that Paul received, that
[1:09:43] Silas received. You can receive that
[1:09:46] exact same Holy Spirit in you. I'm
[1:09:49] telling you, it's not a different one.
[1:09:52] It is, it is still, it's one God.
[1:09:54] There's not three. There's not four or
[1:09:56] five. God is one. Can you say amen? And
[1:09:59] that Holy Spirit is the same Holy Ghost.
[1:10:03] Amen. Whatever that charity when you
[1:10:05] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:06] you get the same Holy Ghost I received.
[1:10:09] The same Holy Ghost that I received is
[1:10:11] what brother Brandham received. The same
[1:10:13] Well, are y'all understanding? It's not
[1:10:15] two different Holy Ghosts.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And think of it. Just
[1:10:22] as a demon-possessed person and and and
[1:10:26] I don't know if you all have ever seen
[1:10:27] demonpossessed persons, but I'm they're
[1:10:28] strong and they're belligerent and
[1:10:30] they're mean and they're right. Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; But when you receive the Holy Ghost, you
[1:10:36] become possessed
[1:10:39] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; The same one that created the earth. The
[1:10:44] same one that said, "Let there be." The
[1:10:46] same. Are y'all understanding? You are
[1:10:48] possessed
[1:10:50] of a loving spirit.
[1:10:55] You are possessed of a spirit that is
[1:10:58] producing holiness and righteousness and
[1:11:01] healing and mercy. Can you say amen?
[1:11:05] Amen. And I and and I want to just tell
[1:11:07] you when the Holy Ghost comes upon you,
[1:11:09] if you ever receive the baptism of the
[1:11:11] Holy Ghost, Amen. It is irrevocable. It
[1:11:15] cannot be changed. It cannot be
[1:11:17] reversed. It cannot be anulled. What God
[1:11:20] done at Pentecost, he will forever more
[1:11:22] do to every one of his sons and
[1:11:25] daughters.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; It is your promise.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; So I say, Lord, give me a cry. I think
[1:11:34] there's too there's not enough of a cry
[1:11:36] anymore
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; because it's become the gospel has
[1:11:40] become so intellectualized. Everything
[1:11:42] is all intellectualism. We just come and
[1:11:44] we just the preacher teaches and we just
[1:11:46] all say
[1:11:48] but but the Holy Ghost is not a new
[1:11:50] thought.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not a new leaf.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the is the great God
[1:11:57] of heaven moving on the inside of you
[1:11:59] living his word
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; into you.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Now, amen.
[1:12:07] We We've been promised in this in this
[1:12:09] day.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we've been promised that that
[1:12:15] the Holy Ghost would come to us in a
[1:12:18] greater measure than ever before. Now we
[1:12:20] understand that that it had been shut
[1:12:23] out at at the uh out at you know of the
[1:12:28] church at the door of religious dogmas
[1:12:30] and creeds where men have set up creeds
[1:12:33] and they've dogmas and their teachings
[1:12:35] and and and it's taken away the faith of
[1:12:37] the people until the Holy Spirit could
[1:12:39] not work in anyone anymore. Right?
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why we got to
[1:12:43] really watch what we believe.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't believe something that the
[1:12:47] Bible doesn't say
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; because that little bit of doubt right
[1:12:51] there will will will will hold back.
[1:12:54] It'll hold back the Holy Spirit from
[1:12:56] your life. Again, what is my title? The
[1:12:59] Holy Spirit for a surrendered life. You
[1:13:03] can't say, "I'm going so far." You
[1:13:06] you've got to say, Lord, whatever is in
[1:13:09] your book, that's what I want for me.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I want it for me. Can you say amen?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; The message has come. Amen. It has come
[1:13:20] to us in this day for what purpose? To
[1:13:23] break down the barriers, the traditional
[1:13:27] barriers in your mind and soul. those
[1:13:29] things that have been preached at us and
[1:13:32] taught of to us that was not according
[1:13:34] to scripture. The message has come to to
[1:13:37] knock it all out so that the Holy Spirit
[1:13:40] can once again flow in the church.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; It's not that God has changed. It's not
[1:13:50] you say, "Well, why don't we see what we
[1:13:51] saw?" We we do see those things. Every
[1:13:54] surrendered heart will see the
[1:13:57] supernatural God at work in their lives.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; But you got to you're going to get
[1:14:04] fought hard.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Satan's going to fight. Amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Even even our brothers that
[1:14:11] got baptized last Wednesday night. You
[1:14:13] think you think the devil You think the
[1:14:15] devil's going to allow
[1:14:18] allow y'all to just get baptized and let
[1:14:20] everything be hunky dory? Satan's going
[1:14:22] to fight you hard, brother Bos.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; He's going to fight and fight and fight.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; But we got to understand this is worth
[1:14:32] it. Satan's trying to to to hinder me
[1:14:35] from receiving the Holy Ghost. Satan is
[1:14:37] trying to hinder me from God working his
[1:14:41] work in my life. I am going to fight it.
[1:14:43] I'm going to resist it. I'm going to
[1:14:46] stay with God's word because I want God
[1:14:49] to take total control of me. Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you just love it?
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; See, that's what God has been doing. All
[1:15:00] right. Now, I've got a few more minutes
[1:15:02] be before I I before I quit. And and I
[1:15:05] want you to look here.
[1:15:08] Okay. Let's look here as you are sons
[1:15:10] and daughters of God.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; As the spirit of God,
[1:15:16] God came down and created in the Virgin
[1:15:20] Mary the cells from which that body was
[1:15:22] born. God created, he spoke his word and
[1:15:27] created in the womb of Mary a seed.
[1:15:31] Hallelujah. Jesus was not a Jew. Jesus
[1:15:35] was not a Samaritan. Jesus was not a
[1:15:38] Gentile.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus was God. That's right.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; The blood. Hallelujah. You say, "Now,
[1:15:45] now there in the book of Acts, the 20th
[1:15:47] chapter, the Apostle Paul says, "We are
[1:15:51] saved by the blood of God."
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Saved by the blood of God.
[1:16:01] Amen. Now, so I want you to keep that in
[1:16:03] your mind. Amen. He created the blood
[1:16:06] cell. the blood cell, the the the the
[1:16:10] the
[1:16:11] seed, if you will, comes from the male.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; It does not come from the female. It
[1:16:19] comes from the male. God's blood, God's
[1:16:24] God's blood cell was created in the womb
[1:16:28] of Mary.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. But he had a reason for doing
[1:16:32] it,
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; To redeem us back.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. the gift to put man back in
[1:16:39] authority and power over the over the
[1:16:42] devil.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. So he created the cells in
[1:16:47] the womb of Mary for that body. It was
[1:16:49] not enough the Holy Spirit to just give
[1:16:51] life to a human of them supplied by Mary
[1:16:54] neither. Amen. That that would have been
[1:16:56] sinful mankind producing a body. that
[1:16:59] would not have produced the last Adam of
[1:17:01] of whom it was said lo a body thou
[1:17:04] father hast prepared to me it's pray for
[1:17:06] me so God not Mary provided that body
[1:17:11] Mary was the human incubator
[1:17:14] Mary was the one that held the the new
[1:17:18] creation she carried that holy child and
[1:17:22] brought him to birth he was a god man he
[1:17:26] was the son of god he was of a new
[1:17:29] creation. God and man had joined. Well,
[1:17:34] can you say
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; They're in 2 Corinthians 5:17.
[1:17:41] Amen. If you want to look at this real
[1:17:43] quick.
[1:17:45] Second 2 Corinthians
[1:17:48] 5
[1:17:52] and 17.
[1:17:55] I'm in 1 Corinthians. It needs to be
[1:17:57] second. Hallelujah.
[1:18:00] 5 and 17. Therefore,
[1:18:03] if any man be in Christ,
[1:18:07] he is a new creature.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away, and behold,
[1:18:13] all things are become new.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Well, someone shout hallelujah.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to watch this.
[1:18:24] You can see that though man was of the
[1:18:28] older order or the old creation, he is
[1:18:32] now in union with Christ and he has
[1:18:34] become the new creation of God. God is
[1:18:37] starting a new creation. So when we come
[1:18:40] in and this new birth, when you receive
[1:18:42] the Holy Ghost, it is the it's a new
[1:18:44] birth. God is starting a new creation in
[1:18:47] you.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's not it's not the
[1:18:52] old uh haven but there is a new
[1:18:55] creation. The Bible actually the Bible
[1:18:57] plainly says that there in the book of
[1:18:59] of of uh Revelations the third chapter.
[1:19:02] Amen. That Jesus was the first of the
[1:19:07] creation of God.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Now, it wasn't that God created him way
[1:19:10] back then. It was the first of the God
[1:19:13] race.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the first of the God race.
[1:19:22] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so let's just put it this
[1:19:26] way. I'm trying not to get too deep
[1:19:27] because it's Wednesday night and I don't
[1:19:28] want to be here too long, but I but I
[1:19:30] got I but I got some stuff that's that's
[1:19:31] coming to mind that's really good.
[1:19:33] Hallelujah. The Apostle Paul said there
[1:19:36] is the first man Adam and there is the
[1:19:39] last man Adam. Now, why would he call a
[1:19:42] first man Adam and the last man Adam?
[1:19:45] Well, the first man, Adam, Amen. He was
[1:19:48] the representative of all of all the
[1:19:50] humankind,
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And he sold us into sin. Therefore, by
[1:19:55] one man's sin,
[1:19:58] one man's offense, sin came upon us all.
[1:20:02] We're all born in a defeated life.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; But Jesus
[1:20:09] was the the last man, Adam. Jesus was
[1:20:14] the representative of God's new race.
[1:20:19] Jesus at with one man's sin uh uh uh uh
[1:20:24] death came upon all and with one man's
[1:20:27] righteousness
[1:20:29] uh uh with one man's right. Let's let's
[1:20:31] look here in the book of Romans just
[1:20:32] real quick. I I'll I'll show it to you.
[1:20:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now, I want us to look
[1:20:40] here in Romans the 5th chapter.
[1:20:43] And um we're going to start at the 17th
[1:20:46] verse.
[1:20:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:52] For by one man's offense, death reigned
[1:20:55] by one. Much more they which receive the
[1:20:59] abundance of grace and of the gift of
[1:21:02] righteousness shall reign in life by
[1:21:04] one, Jesus Christ. Therefore, as by the
[1:21:08] offenses of one, judgment came unto all
[1:21:11] men to condemnation, even so by the
[1:21:14] righteousness of one, the free gift come
[1:21:16] upon all men unto justification. For if
[1:21:20] by one man's disobedience many were made
[1:21:23] sinners, so by the obedience of one
[1:21:26] shall many be made righteous, someone
[1:21:29] shout hallelujah.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; There was the first man, Adam. That's
[1:21:34] the natural. That's the sinner. But
[1:21:37] Jesus is the new.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; He is the author of the new race.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; So Jesus came.
[1:21:48] Amen. He wasn't born sexually. He was
[1:21:51] born the way that the rest of us should
[1:21:52] have been born. Can you say amen?
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Now I I I I want us to c Now do you
[1:21:58] understand what I'm saying? Jesus was
[1:22:00] the first of the God race. I just want
[1:22:04] to say that when you receive the life of
[1:22:05] God on the inside of you, you become a
[1:22:08] part of the God race. You are a son of
[1:22:12] God.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Do you love him?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now again, this new creation
[1:22:22] is not the old creation patched up. So,
[1:22:24] when you become a Christian, when you're
[1:22:25] born again, you it's not it's not that
[1:22:28] you're all patched up. It's not that
[1:22:29] God's it's okay. You're really an
[1:22:31] alcoholic, but but but we we'll deal
[1:22:33] with that. Yeah, you're really a liar,
[1:22:35] but we'll deal with that. You're really
[1:22:37] this and you're all patched up. No, the
[1:22:39] new creation is the very nature of God
[1:22:43] on the inside of you.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; You're born again,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; And if you're born again, you're not a
[1:22:52] slave.
[1:22:54] If you're born again, you're not a
[1:22:55] prisoner. If you're born again, you're a
[1:22:58] son of God. and all that God has is your
[1:23:02] at your disposal.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; The victories of God are right there
[1:23:05] with you. I I just want to say when you
[1:23:07] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:23:09] brother, there there is there is nothing
[1:23:12] the devil can bring at you. Amen. Now,
[1:23:14] the devil's going to bring everything he
[1:23:15] can at you. He's going to he's going to
[1:23:17] throw everything your way that he can.
[1:23:18] But, brethren, when you're of that new
[1:23:21] race, there is no weapon formed against
[1:23:23] you that can prosper. Can you say amen?
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. of the old race of of of the
[1:23:30] of the old Some of us were Amen. Uh uh
[1:23:33] uh uh born my wife born a Cherokee. I
[1:23:36] I've got chalk tall. Uh uh there's some
[1:23:39] of you here that's pawny. There's
[1:23:40] there's some of you that don't know what
[1:23:42] you are. You just mut. Amen. There's We
[1:23:45] all come from We We We all come from the
[1:23:48] different a different but but what did
[1:23:50] the Bible say? He of one blood
[1:23:54] has redeemed us all from every tribe and
[1:23:58] nation and has brought us all into his
[1:24:03] great economy, his great family. Oh, can
[1:24:07] you say amen? Amen. Now, out of every
[1:24:10] nation, every tribe, every every
[1:24:13] kindred, he has purposed a new creation.
[1:24:17] Amen. He is the first of that creation.
[1:24:20] And he is still having sons and
[1:24:23] daughters that are born right here today
[1:24:26] in in this old world. I might be I might
[1:24:30] still be named Wendell Martin, but on
[1:24:32] the inside of me is a new creation.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; I'm a new being. I'm a son of God. Can
[1:24:40] you say
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; His grace, his love, his it's been
[1:24:45] extended to me. I am of his kind. So by
[1:24:49] his spirit he's creating many sons to
[1:24:53] himself. Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Now if Jesus was the first of this new
[1:24:58] race, every child other child of God is
[1:25:01] going to have Amen. to be born of him.
[1:25:05] He's got to receive his spirit. He's got
[1:25:07] to receive his nature.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; And then that born again creation is a
[1:25:12] continuation
[1:25:13] of that creation that God started in
[1:25:15] Christ.
[1:25:17] M M
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we judge ourselves too much by
[1:25:24] this.
[1:25:26] Me being me being a Martin, me being a
[1:25:29] human, me Amen. I've got I've got the
[1:25:34] nature of my father, the nature of my
[1:25:36] mother in me. Amen. That's that's come
[1:25:39] all the way on down. And then and that
[1:25:42] and that's that's that's produced
[1:25:43] complexes.
[1:25:45] And then my sons, the nature of their
[1:25:49] their mother or the nature of their
[1:25:51] father. Hallelujah. You think there's
[1:25:53] conflict between me and her. Sometimes
[1:25:55] it's it's on the inside of those boys.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We come together and our natures
[1:26:02] go into our sons.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; We are all we all right.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And sometimes when we come in and as as
[1:26:10] Christians, we keep judging ourselves by
[1:26:13] this. I keep judging myself by what I
[1:26:16] see in on on my birth certificate. Amen.
[1:26:21] And and that's that's all I see. But
[1:26:23] when I have been born again of the
[1:26:26] spirit of God, I'm of that new race.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:32] That that soul on the inside of me has
[1:26:35] been born again.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; So you're no longer Amen. just Luke, the
[1:26:41] son of of Harry and Stephanie, you are
[1:26:46] Luke, the son of God.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And when this body is done away with,
[1:26:53] and how how many knows this body is all
[1:26:55] got to be done away with?
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. This this body between my mother
[1:26:59] and my father, Amen, this is going to
[1:27:01] go. It's got it can't even make the
[1:27:03] rapture even if you're even if you're
[1:27:04] going God God's got to change this old
[1:27:06] body even before you can even make it on
[1:27:08] the other side.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Bible says corruption must give way to
[1:27:14] incorruption.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; So what you've got on the inside of you
[1:27:18] is not just a good feeling. What God has
[1:27:22] done to you through the new birth is not
[1:27:24] just uh coming and joining a church.
[1:27:27] What God has done on the inside of you.
[1:27:30] It's the Holy Spirit has made a brand
[1:27:33] new creation of you through the baptism
[1:27:35] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; You're not selfish anymore.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; You're not you're not you're you're not
[1:27:42] living for yourself anymore. You're
[1:27:44] living for him.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; You're not you're not wanting to to to
[1:27:48] to to to be the big shot. You're not
[1:27:51] wanting to to you you now your desire,
[1:27:54] Amen, is the same desire God has. God's
[1:27:57] desire is redemption. God's been chasing
[1:27:59] after you all of your life to bring
[1:28:02] eternal life to you. And you find
[1:28:03] yourself acting the exact same way.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; It's the life of God on the inside of
[1:28:12] you. A person that's that's that's
[1:28:14] that's got to have everything their way
[1:28:16] all the time. And well, they just need
[1:28:18] they just need to be born again. That's
[1:28:20] what they need.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; They're selfish. And we're all born
[1:28:25] selfish.
[1:28:27] Well, well, well, well, well, well,
[1:28:28] well, well, well. Just Hallelujah. Did
[1:28:31] you know pride, the middle, the middle
[1:28:33] letter of pride is I?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; P R I D E. Either way you look at it,
[1:28:39] whether you spell it frontwards or
[1:28:40] backwards, I I me. Pride. Me. Me.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want this. I want that. I Yeah.
[1:28:46] I I I think I I Well, you didn't. Well,
[1:28:48] I I I I I. It's all. But when Jesus
[1:28:52] comes in
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; and that new birth takes place now
[1:28:55] there's a reality. Now it's our desire
[1:28:58] we're living for others.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Well, it's not about me anymore. It's
[1:29:05] God's life living on if the life that
[1:29:08] was in Jesus lives in me. the life that
[1:29:12] made Jesus please the father. And he
[1:29:15] went, the Bible says he went around
[1:29:17] doing good and healing all that were
[1:29:20] sick and oppressed of the devil.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus come, the Bible says he had
[1:29:25] compassion upon all of those who come
[1:29:28] and he groaned and he and he and he and
[1:29:31] he and he wept for those around him. And
[1:29:34] when you get the life of God on the
[1:29:36] inside of you, the very life of God is
[1:29:39] just pulsating in your life. I want to
[1:29:42] serve him. I want to I want to express
[1:29:45] his being. Everything about me, I want
[1:29:49] you to succeed because he's helping me
[1:29:53] to succeed.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for the
[1:30:03] power of the Holy Ghost?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; I think we're going to quit right there.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, I think that's enough, right? That
[1:30:12] that right there is enough to wet all of
[1:30:16] your whistles. What if you haven't
[1:30:18] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost?
[1:30:21] I hope it wets your whistle. I hope it
[1:30:23] Yeah. I hope it makes you start
[1:30:24] hungering for the things of God.
[1:30:26] Remember, you were created to hunger not
[1:30:28] for the devil and the things of sin. You
[1:30:30] were created a hunger for God. And when
[1:30:32] God comes in and washes you and starts,
[1:30:35] Amen.
[1:30:37] washing these things away, then the real
[1:30:39] you begins to come out,
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; the really who you are. And then desire
[1:30:44] says, I want more of God. I want more of
[1:30:47] God. Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; And the good thing is, as the scripture
[1:30:52] says, Amen. Those that hunger and thirst
[1:30:57] after righteousness
[1:30:59] may actually be filled.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Is that what it said?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible if they that hunger and thirst
[1:31:07] after righteousness
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; shall
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; shall didn't even say will. Shall
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; it's the document. That's that's a
[1:31:18] judicial word. Shall
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; be filled. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know what I'm going to
[1:31:26] start doing? I'm gonna start hungering
[1:31:29] and thirsting. God, I I I I just ask
[1:31:32] right now, I ask the Lord to just cause
[1:31:34] every one of you to start hungering and
[1:31:35] thirsting after God more and more. I
[1:31:39] pray that God just baptizes us all with
[1:31:43] a real with a real hunger.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, my real hunger. Amen. And if we're
[1:31:50] not hungry, why are we not hungry?
[1:31:52] Mama's in there cooking and she's got
[1:31:54] the table spread and she's got
[1:31:56] everything all sitting there and you're
[1:31:57] just n you're just picking at it and
[1:31:58] you're not wanting to eat it. Is because
[1:32:00] somebody has been eating some junk food.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody's been eating some Twinkies,
[1:32:08] some sneaking a candy bar. Hallelujah.
[1:32:12] Some of you wives are looking at your
[1:32:13] husbands.
[1:32:15] See, aren't you glad you come to church?
[1:32:16] I just I just told you the reason. Amen.
[1:32:19] see that that the Holy Spirit
[1:32:22] if we're not hungering for God the way
[1:32:25] we should is because Satan
[1:32:28] is filling that hunger with other stuff.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; But they that hunger and thirst after
[1:32:36] righteousness
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; shall be filled. If the musicians would
[1:32:39] come.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost has promised.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Holy Ghost. Yes,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Lord. I want to I want your I want your
[1:32:49] presence. I I I I I want to receive the
[1:32:52] Holy Ghost more than I want anything
[1:32:55] else.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; I want your life in me, Lord. Give me a
[1:32:59] Give me a new birth.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Did you know the first doctrine that
[1:33:02] Jesus ever preached? Did you know what
[1:33:04] you can anyone can anyone tell me what
[1:33:06] Jesus' first doctrine was?
[1:33:10] Huh?
[1:33:13] Did I hear somebody? Did you say
[1:33:18] you must be born again? That's right.
[1:33:21] Jesus first doctrine,
[1:33:25] you must be born again.
[1:33:31] And Nicodemus, who was a great teacher,
[1:33:35] he said, "Now, how can me being an old
[1:33:38] man, how can I go back into my mother's
[1:33:42] womb and be born again?"
[1:33:46] Jesus says, "That which is born of flesh
[1:33:49] is flesh,
[1:33:51] but that which is born of spirit is
[1:33:54] spirit." Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Then he talks about the water, the
[1:34:01] blood, and the spirit.
[1:34:04] There in the book of first John, the
[1:34:07] scripture says
[1:34:10] there are three that bear record
[1:34:15] in heaven.
[1:34:17] The father, the word, and the spirit.
[1:34:21] These three are one.
[1:34:24] There are three that bear record in the
[1:34:27] earth.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Water, blood, and spirit. These three
[1:34:33] agree in one.
[1:34:37] God is in three offices. It's one God.
[1:34:40] It's one God. The invisible spirit. It's
[1:34:43] God living in a body. Now it's God
[1:34:46] living in me and you.
[1:34:48] Three offices of God.
[1:34:51] But you can have the water without
[1:34:54] having the spirit. You can have the
[1:34:57] blood without having the water. You can
[1:34:59] repent and not be sanctified. But as you
[1:35:02] repent, you're baptized in the name of
[1:35:05] the Lord. Amen. Washing our sins away.
[1:35:09] Then we receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:11] Ghost. And this is the confirmation or
[1:35:14] brings the con the consummation of the
[1:35:17] new birth.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I want more of
[1:35:22] God.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; You want more of God? You want more of
[1:35:25] God? I want more of God. How about you
[1:35:27] all? You boys want more of God?
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mas and daddies, y'all want more
[1:35:31] of God.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; The cry
[1:35:36] the cry for more of God.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Some says, "Well, we don't we we don't
[1:35:40] need altars anymore." And that kind of
[1:35:42] theology is just is just totally
[1:35:45] opposite of what the prophet taught.
[1:35:48] He was talking about the insincerity
[1:35:50] that comes people coming up chewing gum,
[1:35:53] coming up to an altar call and some
[1:35:55] preacher saying your mama's over there
[1:35:56] and your grandma's just begging and
[1:35:58] they're just pleading and hoping you're
[1:35:59] going to be there and you say, "Man, I
[1:36:01] don't want grandma spending eternity
[1:36:04] grieving over me. So, I'm going to come
[1:36:05] to an altar."
[1:36:08] But there's a genuine real genuine and
[1:36:10] don't and then ain't it ain't just an
[1:36:11] altar here at the church. It should be
[1:36:13] an altar at our house. It should be an
[1:36:15] altar wherever we are. It should be an
[1:36:17] altar.
[1:36:19] Lord, I want to please you
[1:36:22] now, guys. And and and and you know, I'm
[1:36:24] always preaching to these teenagers,
[1:36:29] but but those even even those of you
[1:36:31] that are that that that are that are at
[1:36:33] that 20 year old, you're in your, you
[1:36:37] know, you're you're in the prime. You
[1:36:39] guys that are in your in your 20s, it
[1:36:43] listen,
[1:36:45] don't let nothing take away the desire
[1:36:48] for more of God.
[1:36:52] Mas and daddies say, "I don't I don't
[1:36:53] care if you've been serving the Lord for
[1:36:55] a long time."
[1:37:01] And I and I I and I know
[1:37:08] I I I was looking at at a few quotes
[1:37:13] today and it says what we need today is
[1:37:15] another refilling another like the
[1:37:18] disciple. Some of you trying to test an
[1:37:20] experience or trust an experience that
[1:37:22] happened 10 years ago. That's all right.
[1:37:25] But what about today?
[1:37:28] You need one today. Today is the day.
[1:37:31] Sure, a filling. The disciples about
[1:37:33] three or four days after they received
[1:37:34] the Holy Ghost went back and got in one
[1:37:37] accord and began to pray until the Holy
[1:37:40] Ghost shook the building where they were
[1:37:42] sitting.
[1:37:44] It's a refilling. Every one of us need a
[1:37:46] refilling of the Holy Spirit. Can you
[1:37:50] say amen? Amen.
[1:37:53] He He He said, I see some of the
[1:37:54] tabernacle folks here. I'm going to say
[1:37:56] this about big sister. One thing that
[1:37:58] the tabernacle needs up there at our
[1:38:01] church, tabernacle with Jeff is a
[1:38:03] rededication and refilling of the Holy
[1:38:05] Ghost where everyone get down to the
[1:38:07] altar and pray until they get a
[1:38:09] renewing.
[1:38:11] Until they get a
[1:38:14] renewing of the Holy Ghost, the whole
[1:38:16] church filled with the power of God.
[1:38:18] That's what we need. Not only that
[1:38:20] tabernacle, but the body of Christ
[1:38:21] universal needs a refilling.
[1:38:24] David said one day, "Restore to me the
[1:38:26] joy of my salvation." Not that he lost
[1:38:29] his salvation, but the joy of
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:39] He says, "Right this night
[1:38:42] while we're sitting here, if this right
[1:38:44] atmosphere would take place, the entire
[1:38:47] group would be refilled with the Holy
[1:38:49] Ghost
[1:38:51] and every sick person be made well."
[1:38:53] It's the atmosphere that does it.
[1:38:56] Another place, it'll take more than
[1:38:58] grease to open them eyes, brother. It'll
[1:39:01] take a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:04] to massage your eyes and you can see and
[1:39:07] take the nearsightedness out of you so
[1:39:09] you can see the word of God is true.
[1:39:12] That's right. I counsel you to get some
[1:39:15] eyes sav the kind that anoints your
[1:39:18] eyes.
[1:39:22] He says, "But the church of the living
[1:39:23] God is making herself ready inside by
[1:39:25] renewing their faith daily
[1:39:29] in the Holy Ghost."
[1:39:31] My there just so many of those things as
[1:39:34] Amen. That's what we need. I'm just
[1:39:38] saying, Lord,
[1:39:40] not just not just for those who need the
[1:39:42] Holy Ghost. If you need it,
[1:39:45] it's a gift. You don't have to beg for
[1:39:46] it. God wants to give it, but it's a
[1:39:49] surrendered life. And in order to
[1:39:51] receive a refilling of the Holy Ghost,
[1:39:54] you've got to go back and be
[1:39:55] surrendered.
[1:39:57] Going back.
[1:39:59] I want to surrender everything I am to
[1:40:02] you. God bless you tonight.
[1:40:07] I don't want to live a powerless life. I
[1:40:10] want to live a vibrant life.
[1:40:14] As I said many times, I don't want to
[1:40:15] live a mediocre life with my wife.
[1:40:23] I'd rather have one to where we're
[1:40:24] close.
[1:40:27] I long for that.
[1:40:31] I I do.
[1:40:33] I I want I want that kind of a deal
[1:40:36] between me and God,
[1:40:38] a closeness. I long for that.
[1:40:42] You say, "Well, you're you're not
[1:40:44] satisfied." No.
[1:40:46] Not when heaven is waiting on me. Not
[1:40:50] when the when the skies are full of the
[1:40:52] Pentecostal blessings. Why would I Why
[1:40:54] would I be mediocre when there's more of
[1:40:56] God to be had? I want more.
[1:41:01] Amen. I want that.
[1:41:05] Praise the Lord. What are you singing?
[1:41:10] Hunger and thirst
[1:41:14] for you.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; I hunger and thirst
[1:41:22] for you.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; I hunger and thirst
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; and thirst
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:41:36] I hunger and thirst
[1:41:40] for you
[1:41:44] in the desert of my need. You're the
[1:41:49] fountain that I seek.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; You're the living water I
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; I keep running into.
[1:41:59] [Music]
[1:42:01] I hest.
[1:42:04] Oh, bless the Lord.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I hunger and
[1:42:14] for you.
[1:42:17] Oh, I hunger and
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; take all out of me, Lord.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Scrub me with your word.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; I
[1:42:28] wash
[1:42:31] you.
[1:42:34] Let me do a cleanse. Lord, take all the
[1:42:37] junk out of me.
[1:42:40] If I need a cleanse, I sometimes we have
[1:42:43] to cleanse our these old bodies from
[1:42:46] this poisons and things that we that we
[1:42:51] get in them. I think sometimes we need
[1:42:53] to do that in our spiritual walk just to
[1:42:55] cleanse. Want to want to take a cleanse,
[1:42:57] get get rid of all that junk. And the
[1:43:00] opening of the word will do that. You
[1:43:01] know
[1:43:03] that that a living word will will
[1:43:05] cleanse you,
[1:43:08] wash all of the take all of the old
[1:43:11] stuff out.
[1:43:14] It'll it'll it'll take all of the junk
[1:43:18] out
[1:43:20] to where all you want is more of God.
[1:43:24] More of God.
[1:43:27] More of God.
[1:43:31] so much more of him.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; I want more of him.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; I want so much more of him. I I
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; want a greater desire
[1:43:49] [Music]
[1:43:51] in the in the return in Jubilee
[1:43:55] the sermon.
[1:43:58] There was such a cry. He said, "Can't
[1:44:02] pray anymore? Why? Why is it that we
[1:44:03] can't pray anymore?
[1:44:07] Why Why is it that we He said, "Where is
[1:44:09] the seal that burned in the hearts and
[1:44:12] people walked the railroad track, picked
[1:44:15] up the corn and crushed it out there to
[1:44:17] bring the gospel up?
[1:44:19] We make them turn over our graves, bring
[1:44:21] disgrace to our fathers and mothers who
[1:44:23] fought to win the prize.
[1:44:26] Here we just luxury around
[1:44:28] denominations.
[1:44:33] He's calling again.
[1:44:35] He's pulled his elected church out of
[1:44:37] those denominations.
[1:44:40] God pulled that remnant out. That's what
[1:44:44] he's wanting.
[1:44:46] [Applause]
[1:44:48] He's the church has forgot those street
[1:44:50] meetings long ago. And the church forgot
[1:44:52] its long nights of prayer.
[1:44:55] Well, they can't pray 15 minutes no
[1:44:57] more. Oh my. When it does, it some
[1:44:59] little formal thing. Half of them fall
[1:45:01] asleep. I hate
[1:45:04] chickens trying to eat eagle food. You
[1:45:06] can't do it. Won't digest.
[1:45:09] Not built for it.
[1:45:12] But oh God,
[1:45:14] the only way you can ever get that is to
[1:45:16] be born again.
