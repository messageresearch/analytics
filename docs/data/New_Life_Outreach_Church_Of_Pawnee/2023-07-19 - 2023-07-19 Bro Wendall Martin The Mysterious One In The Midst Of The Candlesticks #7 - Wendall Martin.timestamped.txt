[34:07] because it is quite the mystery to the

[34:16] sometimes have a hard time fathoming how
[34:18] that
[34:20] God so loved us that he became a human

[34:28] Adam was created for God to have a body
[34:33] a body that that he could use and that
[34:38] Iman that's that's what God's intention
[34:40] was
[34:43] to fill him like the Holy Ghost does us
[34:45] today and
[34:47] to live his life
[34:50] When sin came in and wrecked the whole
[34:52] plan or wrecked the whole thing
[34:55] according to the carnal man
[34:57] amen and God came in flesh and God
[35:00] redeemed us
[35:02] and he didn't just go back to heaven
[35:05] the holy spirit is here he's still
[35:07] living
[35:09] in Earthly bodies today
[35:12] and I'm so thankful for that here

[38:31] that God has given us a third pull
[38:33] Ministry greater than any other time
[38:36] this is the Judgment time this is the
[38:38] time where the bride is coming to his
[38:40] completion and so
[38:42] um we will walk right in we will be the
[38:46] final voice to the final age we will
[38:48] walk right into the rapture we will
[38:51] fight our way into the Rapture with that
[38:54] two-edged sword that comes out of the
[38:57] mouth of Christ amen and so amen uh the
[39:02] the same Living Word it's the Living
[39:05] Word that was in Christ is is walking in
[39:09] the midst of the candlesticks and so
[39:12] amen this layout of sea and age Jesus is
[39:18] taken off the covers he's taken off the
[39:21] Veil tale of of the of the mystery and
[39:25] so it is no longer a mystery we can see
[39:29] plainly what God has had in in plain
[39:32] view that has been God in his church
[39:36] amen so you've wondered well where is
[39:38] Jesus where where is Jesus he's he's a
[39:41] uh if he's real where is he we want to
[39:44] but the scripture says that Christ would
[39:47] come in his church he would live in you
[39:51] like he lived in Jesus that's the
[39:55] Revelation amen now you got to catch
[39:58] that that's the Revelation it is God in
[40:02] you the hope of glory and and so this is
[40:06] so good no other ages had this but it's
[40:09] in the seventh age that God's given the
[40:12] promise that he would do this through
[40:14] the seventh Church age messenger and we
[40:16] would see Christ in his deity and
[40:18] brother Branham would say he is God very
[40:22] God now that's that's that's an exact
[40:24] quote he is God very God Amen so Jesus
[40:29] is not the second person of the godhead
[40:31] Jesus is the body of Christ can you sing
[40:34] man so as we deal with the countenance
[40:37] of his face as the son now of course
[40:40] this is this is talking of of the of the
[40:44] realities of the return of the Lord amen
[40:47] then and the scripture says did you know
[40:50] um did you kids know that there will we

[45:15] right so what's going to happen the
[45:17] nations of the earth will walk in the
[45:21] light of it amen
[45:25] and so we we are so we are looking
[45:29] forward to that time the countenance of
[45:32] his face as the Sun so we know that
[45:35] we're this is the this is the uh this is
[45:39] the talking about this last day now
[45:41] let's just look into this for a few
[45:43] moments here tonight uh and and I want
[45:46] us to look here at Matthew the 17th
[45:49] chapter brother Branham when he when he
[45:51] talked about this in the church age book
[45:53] he he he went straight to this uh
[45:56] passage of scripture here in Matthew the
[45:59] 17th chapter amen his
[46:03] face was as the son
[46:07] and how many remembers Mount
[46:08] Transfiguration that that's what he's
[46:11] talking about here Mount Transfiguration
[46:13] there in Matthew the 17th chapter then
[46:16] we're going to read at the first verse
[46:19] amen when you're there Say Amen
[46:22] all right it says and after six days
[46:26] Jesus Takes Peter James and John his
[46:30] brother
[46:31] and bring them into a high mountain
[46:34] apart
[46:35] and was transfigured before them and his
[46:39] face dis did shine as the sun
[46:43] and his raiment was white as the light
[46:46] so now here Jesus is he's his his face
[46:51] is is transformed showing of this last
[46:55] day now let's just keep on reading and
[46:58] behold there appeared unto them Moses
[47:00] and Elias talking with him then answered
[47:03] Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is
[47:05] good for us to be here
[47:07] if thou Wilt let us make three
[47:09] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[47:12] and one for Elias
[47:15] and while he yet spayed Behold a bright
[47:17] Cloud overshadowed them and behold a
[47:21] voice out of the cloud which said this
[47:25] is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[47:28] pleased hear ye him now I want you to
[47:31] notice three things here he has Faith
[47:33] shown as the sun
[47:35] there was a bright Cloud that uh uh
[47:39] covered over them and there was a voice
[47:42] out of the cloud that said hear ye him
[47:46] amen and it says and when the disciples
[47:49] heard it they fell on their face and
[47:50] were so afraid and Jesus came and
[47:53] touched them and said arise Be not
[47:55] Afraid and when they had lifted up their
[47:57] eyes they saw no man save Jesus only
[48:00] and as they came down from the mountain
[48:02] Jesus charged them saying tell the
[48:05] vision to no man until the son of man be
[48:07] risen again from the dead and his
[48:09] disciples asked him why say the
[48:13] describes that Elias must first come
[48:16] and Jesus answered and said to them
[48:19] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[48:22] all things but I say unto you Elias has
[48:24] is come already and they knew him not
[48:27] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[48:30] listed likewise shall also the son of
[48:33] man suffer of them then the disciples
[48:35] understood that he spoke unto them of
[48:38] John the Baptist now now this is
[48:40] important because this was this was a a
[48:44] pre-figure of what the resurrection was
[48:48] going to be and so the disciples were a
[48:52] little bit and if you wouldn't mind
[48:53] turning oh if you just turned back
[48:56] um uh to the Matthew 16 and 27
[49:01] um and and while you're turning there
[49:03] I'll talk but it says uh you know but
[49:05] but but the the disciples were confused
[49:08] uh when they when they seen Christ
[49:11] glorified because there was a scripture
[49:14] that had been prophesied been written
[49:18] that Elijah had to come
[49:21] uh before this takes place so Jesus I
[49:24] want us to look here in Matthew 16 and
[49:27] 27 he had just told them right at the
[49:31] end of this last verse and right before
[49:33] he he is transfigured he he was he was
[49:37] telling that some of them is going to be
[49:38] alive when and and uh and see him coming
[49:42] in his glory so look here in Matthew 16
[49:44] and 27 it says for the son of man shall
[49:47] come in the glory of his father and with
[49:50] his angels then he shall reward every
[49:54] man according to his Works verily I say
[49:57] unto you there be some standing here
[50:01] which shall not taste death
[50:04] till they see the son of man coming into
[50:08] his kingdom so so here Jesus just told
[50:12] there's some of them there that's not
[50:14] going to taste death they're not going
[50:16] to die until they see the second return
[50:20] of Jesus Christ well now they're all
[50:22] confused
[50:24] they're they're confused they're asking
[50:26] that's the reason why they they they
[50:28] asked they said hey wait a minute Elijah
[50:32] has got to come first
[50:35] so they knew the scripture that before
[50:38] the second coming and before this
[50:40] Transfiguration or before Christ would
[50:42] come in his glory
[50:44] there had to be an Elijah and so uh why
[50:48] did they think this because the
[50:50] scripture had already declared let's
[50:53] let's just look there we these are
[50:54] familiar passages but I want to connect
[50:56] these scriptures together
[50:58] to show you why the disciples were were
[51:01] a little confused they're in Malachi the
[51:04] the fourth uh chapter in the fifth verse
[51:09] even it is a familiar passage of
[51:11] scripture but I but I also want you kids
[51:13] to know how to turn there as well
[51:15] um so we'll wait on you to get there
[51:21] they're they're in Malachi 4 and 5 it
[51:23] says behold I will send you Elijah the
[51:27] prophet
[51:29] after
[51:32] before
[51:34] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[51:37] of the Lord
[51:39] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[51:42] fathers to the children the heart of the
[51:44] children to their fathers lest I come
[51:46] and smite the Earth
[51:48] with a curse now when is this supposed
[51:50] to take place
[51:51] before the great and terrible day of the
[51:54] Lord so the disciples were asking as
[51:56] they're coming off that mountain
[51:58] amen Jesus just gave him a preview he
[52:01] gave him a preview there was Moses and
[52:03] Elijah how many knows what Moses and
[52:05] Elijah represented
[52:09] anybody
[52:13] huh
[52:15] the law on the prophets that's right
[52:18] but they were also representing they
[52:20] were also representing something here
[52:23] the dead Saints and the living Saints
[52:27] Moses died
[52:30] amen Elijah was raptured so here they
[52:34] are
[52:35] Jesus is they're they're showing that
[52:39] when this and when this time comes when
[52:41] he comes in it there will be the living
[52:43] Saints and the dead Saints so amen the
[52:47] dead in Christ shall rise first and
[52:49] those which are alive and remain shall
[52:51] be caught up to meet the Lord in the air
[52:54] amen now so so they're asking before
[52:58] this takes place
[53:00] amen we we've got to have an Elijah so
[53:04] so when does this take place if you go
[53:06] back there and read in Malachi 4 let's
[53:09] go ahead and start at the first verse
[53:11] for behold the day cometh that shall
[53:14] burn as an oven
[53:15] and all the proud yea all that do
[53:18] wickedly
[53:19] shall be stubble and the day that cometh
[53:22] shall burn them up saith the Lord of
[53:24] hosts
[53:25] that it shall neither lead them neither
[53:27] root nor Branch now how many knows that
[53:30] the Earth is going to be caught on fire
[53:32] amen the Earth is going to melt away
[53:35] with fervent heat God's going to
[53:37] renovate the Earth that's what it's
[53:40] talking about amen but unto you that
[53:43] fear my name shall the moon light
[53:48] no
[53:50] sell the
[53:52] son of righteousness
[53:55] arise with healing in his wings and ye
[53:58] shall go forth and grow up as calves in
[54:02] the stall ye shall tread down the wicked
[54:05] and for they shall be ashes Under The
[54:07] Souls of your feet and in the day that I
[54:10] shall do this saith the Lord of hosts so
[54:12] now so we definitely know that Elijah
[54:17] had to come
[54:19] before this great day of the Lord but
[54:22] yet even in the appearing of Elijah
[54:26] sunlight was going to shine
[54:30] amen so we're going to be looking at it
[54:33] in the figurative spent since the
[54:35] spiritual sense and the natural sense we
[54:38] do believe that Christ shall return we
[54:42] do believe that he is the light of the
[54:45] world but it's and it's not just in in a
[54:48] spiritual sense God is a real light
[54:53] he is light can you say Amen but yet
[54:57] through the voice of the Prophet that
[54:59] was to come there would also be the son
[55:02] of righteousness with healing in his
[55:04] wings isn't God so precise and when when
[55:07] brother Branham come in our generation
[55:09] there were healing campaigns and
[55:12] miracles and healings all it was when
[55:15] God sent this Malachi for prophet the
[55:19] son of righteousness Amen to prepare us
[55:23] in the way of the Lord can you say Amen
[55:25] so so I want us to look here now now
[55:28] let's let's let's look back for for a
[55:30] moment the disciples were asking Jesus
[55:34] about Malachi's prophecy amen now in
[55:38] Matthew 17 they had just witnessed Jesus
[55:41] being transformed transfigured they had
[55:44] just witnessed his face
[55:46] shining as the son they had just watched
[55:49] Moses and Elijah which had been gone
[55:53] from the earth for hundreds and hundreds
[55:55] of years they're standing there so here
[55:58] is Christ here is Elijah and here is
[56:01] Moses and here they were showing it was
[56:06] like it was like the rehearsal God was
[56:09] showing these disciples what it was
[56:12] going to be that there would be the dead
[56:15] Saints the living Saints would be with
[56:19] Christ reigning on the earth amen when
[56:22] he comes into his kingdom amen isn't
[56:25] that just wonderful amen so and then the
[56:28] bright Cloud overshadows Jesus and a
[56:31] voices spoke that spoke out and said
[56:33] this is my beloved Son
[56:37] hear ye him
[56:39] now
[56:40] so here they come off the mountain when
[56:42] they're coming down off the mountain
[56:43] they talk to Jesus amen and they said
[56:46] now if the son of man is is coming in
[56:48] his kingdom right now isn't Elijah
[56:51] supposed to come now though I want you
[56:54] to go back to Matthew the 17th chapter
[56:56] and let's let's look at it again Matthew
[57:01] 17 and 10. now if the son of man is
[57:04] coming in his kingdom isn't Elijah
[57:06] supposed to come now Jesus response was
[57:09] in the 10th chapter and his disciples
[57:11] asked him uh why then say the scribes
[57:13] that Elias must first come and Jesus
[57:17] answered and said
[57:19] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[57:25] all things so now he's letting them know
[57:28] now wait a minute I this is not this is
[57:32] not this first coming I've got to be a
[57:35] lamb I've got to go to Calvary I've got
[57:39] to pay the ransom price to redeem all of
[57:43] God's elected amen that's that's the
[57:46] reason for my first coming what you saw
[57:49] was the second coming when I'm coming in
[57:52] my glory and Elijah shall first come
[57:56] because at the end of those seven Church
[57:59] ages it's going to be all is going to be
[58:02] mixed and Scattered and he's going to
[58:04] have to restore
[58:06] our faith back to bring us into this
[58:10] into when when the son comes into his
[58:13] kingdom
[58:14] then he says now you're right
[58:17] you're right
[58:18] you've seen before telling of my second
[58:20] coming my second coming I will claim
[58:24] what is mine
[58:26] I've shown you the order I've shown you
[58:27] the resurrection I've shown you the
[58:29] Rapture I I've shown you the redeemed
[58:32] and Elijah truly shall come
[58:36] to forerun that now so amen going down
[58:40] to the 12th verse now we just we just
[58:43] read in the 11th verse and Jesus
[58:44] answered and said Elias truly shall
[58:48] first come and restore all things but I
[58:52] say unto you that Elias has come is come
[58:56] already and they knew him not but have
[58:59] done unto him whatsoever they listed
[59:02] likewise shall also the son of man
[59:04] suffer of them then the disciples
[59:07] understood that he spake unto them of
[59:10] John the Baptist can you say Amen
[59:13] so now so now Jesus is just now telling
[59:15] him are you kids understanding Jesus is
[59:18] just telling them yes
[59:20] Elijah has got to come before the second
[59:23] coming but I say he came before my first
[59:26] coming
[59:28] and no one understood it amen
[59:32] now if he came if he was to come in his
[59:34] first coming there has to be scripture
[59:36] for that too so there there in in
[59:40] Malachi the third chapter
[59:42] if you want to turn there real quickly
[59:44] now again on these kind of on these kind
[59:47] of deals we uh
[59:49] we want to just take her time and and
[59:52] anyone who wants to add anything add
[59:55] you're welcome to do so
[59:58] we are we have been really been blessed
[1:00:00] to have um
[1:00:02] um brother brother Billy and sister
[1:00:04] Debbie watch in on these Wednesday
[1:00:06] nights and um uh she said it would she
[1:00:10] wished she could get on some of these
[1:00:11] questions and things and understand I
[1:00:13] don't know if you can turn these these
[1:00:14] things up to where they can hear
[1:00:16] questions that are asked in the in the
[1:00:18] audience or not but um and then and then
[1:00:22] sisters got some questions too
[1:00:25] um that she would like for us to address
[1:00:26] and so we'll have to do that here before
[1:00:28] long uh Malachi the third chapter
[1:00:32] and the first verse it says behold
[1:00:35] I will send my messenger and he shall
[1:00:39] prepare the way before me and the Lord
[1:00:42] whom you seek shall suddenly come to his
[1:00:46] Temple
[1:00:48] even the messenger of the Covenant which
[1:00:50] he Delight in behold he shall come
[1:00:53] saith the Lord of hosts now you can say
[1:00:56] now when was this to take place Jesus
[1:00:58] said there in Matthew 11 and 10 and you
[1:01:03] can write that and if you're still in
[1:01:05] Malachi the third chapter right there in
[1:01:07] your fly leaf right there Malachi or
[1:01:10] Matthew 11 and 10 Jesus said this is the
[1:01:13] Fulfillment he said this is he of whom
[1:01:17] it is written behold I send my messenger
[1:01:20] before my face which shall prepare thy
[1:01:23] way before thee so Jesus is saying yes
[1:01:28] Malachi 4 and 5 will have to happen
[1:01:32] before the great day of the Lord but I
[1:01:35] say John has already come amen Elijah
[1:01:40] has already come in Malachi the third
[1:01:44] chapter
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:47] and no one understood
[1:01:49] brother Branham would even go and he
[1:01:51] says if you would look real closely if
[1:01:54] you would look real closely at Malachi 4
[1:01:57] and 5. amen it says that he shall turn
[1:02:01] the hearts of the children to the
[1:02:04] fathers and the hearts of the fathers to
[1:02:08] the children
[1:02:09] did you know that that is spoke of of
[1:02:12] both comings of Elijah
[1:02:15] amen so here's here's the deal there was
[1:02:18] Christ that was to come and and and this
[1:02:22] is this is where we've we've got to
[1:02:24] understand here is there is two comings
[1:02:27] of Christ
[1:02:31] amen
[1:02:32] this coming of Christ he was to be
[1:02:36] sacrificed on the altar of God Amen
[1:02:40] praise the Lord this is this is the
[1:02:42] altar of God he would be a lamb that was
[1:02:45] sacrificed on the altar of God
[1:02:48] and he was to the scripture says that he
[1:02:51] was to turn John was to turn the
[1:02:55] children now it wasn't little children
[1:02:57] like you all it was it was to turn the
[1:03:01] young Church the the ones that were to
[1:03:04] come to Christ he was pointing them to
[1:03:07] this lamb that was to come
[1:03:10] that's what John's sole purpose was to
[1:03:13] say Behold the Lamb of God that is him
[1:03:18] that is him can you say Amen now he was
[1:03:22] killed for it because he was so vehement
[1:03:24] about God's word and so vehemently uh
[1:03:27] defending what God what God was doing in
[1:03:31] that day Jesus said no one knew him
[1:03:37] amen so then now the disciples are
[1:03:42] seeing Christ
[1:03:43] as it as as the Conqueror they're seeing
[1:03:46] Christ His Image his face is radiating
[1:03:50] like the sun Christ is now he's no
[1:03:54] longer the lamb now he is coming to
[1:03:58] claim what he has purchased
[1:04:02] Hallelujah
[1:04:04] coming to claim and what is Jesus Jesus
[1:04:08] was the word made flesh
[1:04:12] so God would send and Elijah to point to
[1:04:17] this second coming just like it was an
[1:04:20] Elijah to point to the first coming of
[1:04:22] Christ
[1:04:23] so that's the reason why if you look
[1:04:25] there uh I I I'll read it to you there
[1:04:28] in Malachi 4 and 5. it says or four and
[1:04:31] six and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:04:34] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[1:04:37] the children to the father so now here's
[1:04:40] again here's here's two comings amen two
[1:04:43] two total comings there was an Elijah
[1:04:46] this this Elijah had to come
[1:04:51] to point the fathers
[1:04:54] uh uh fathers to the children
[1:05:01] that's the new church how many
[1:05:04] understands that
[1:05:05] amen they were babes in Christ that was
[1:05:08] that was the first that was the first
[1:05:10] Elijah the second Elijah was to turn
[1:05:15] oops if I couldn't do this right
[1:05:20] turn the hearts
[1:05:23] of the children
[1:05:30] back
[1:05:32] uh if I can spell two fathers
[1:05:39] all right so so this is that's the
[1:05:42] second coming of Elijah two comings of
[1:05:44] Christ two comings of Elijah
[1:05:47] how many understands that
[1:05:49] now when it says turn the children back
[1:05:51] to the fathers who are the fathers
[1:05:56] hmm
[1:05:58] the original Faith the original the the
[1:06:02] the original Bible
[1:06:04] back to the Twelve Apostles
[1:06:07] back to the teachings of the New
[1:06:09] Testament Church
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:13] so so Elijah the first Elijah
[1:06:18] was pointing he all of his disciples
[1:06:21] were were following Elijah they were all
[1:06:23] following him and that day the Bible
[1:06:26] says when when John seen the dove come
[1:06:29] down upon Christ and remaining upon him
[1:06:33] and he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:06:36] the Bible says and many of John's
[1:06:39] disciples walked with him no more and
[1:06:42] followed Christ
[1:06:44] he'd done his job he was pointing to the
[1:06:49] lamb and they were to follow and there's
[1:06:51] where his disciples were at can you say
[1:06:53] Amen so now here we are it takes it
[1:06:57] takes Elijah again
[1:07:00] to identify Hallelujah
[1:07:04] to identify Christ you say well that'll
[1:07:07] be easy
[1:07:08] that'll be a piece of cake
[1:07:10] we'll all see Christ when he comes in
[1:07:12] the sky coming out of a of a big cloud
[1:07:14] everybody lost seam and we'll all know
[1:07:17] when he comes right
[1:07:19] the Bible says it will be a secret
[1:07:22] coming
[1:07:24] that will be like a thief in the night
[1:07:26] no one will know anything about it
[1:07:30] Hallelujah there in in Malachi or
[1:07:33] they're in in in Matthew Jesus talks
[1:07:37] about the Midnight Cry and how that the
[1:07:40] sleeping virgins they were all sleeping
[1:07:43] but it took a messenger to come to say
[1:07:47] arise for the bridegroom comes
[1:07:51] trim your lamps
[1:07:53] get ready the bridegroom is coming
[1:07:58] so it took that Elijah to point to the
[1:08:02] great coming King
[1:08:04] Hallelujah
[1:08:06] and the church world
[1:08:08] now you say now what did Brother Branham
[1:08:10] do can anyone tell me what can can you
[1:08:13] tell me how brother Branham pointed to
[1:08:16] Christ when we haven't even seen Christ
[1:08:19] how could he point to Christ if he never
[1:08:21] saw Christ
[1:08:23] brought him back to the Bible
[1:08:27] brought them right back so Elijah turned
[1:08:30] the hearts of the young Apostolic
[1:08:33] fathers to the children
[1:08:35] amen that's when the Bible was was he
[1:08:38] was uh those those Apostles wrote the
[1:08:40] Bible amen and here we were given we
[1:08:43] were given the words of eternal life all
[1:08:45] of them they all was whether it be Paul
[1:08:48] or Peter or John the Revelator they they
[1:08:52] all they were they were they they would
[1:08:55] become the fathers amen now he's turning
[1:08:59] us back to the fathers because Christ is
[1:09:04] hid in his word
[1:09:07] Christ is hid in his word amen is that
[1:09:12] right
[1:09:12] so uh I will send my messenger and he
[1:09:15] will prepare now now Peter that that
[1:09:19] great day that great transformation day
[1:09:22] that happened on that mountain that day
[1:09:24] it never left Peter Peter was Peter it
[1:09:27] in one place he called it I was he said
[1:09:30] I was on that Holy Mountain now now it
[1:09:33] wasn't that the mountain was holy it was
[1:09:34] just that the holy God was on that
[1:09:36] mountain and he remembered what took
[1:09:39] place he never forgot the happenings of
[1:09:41] that day never so so he understood that
[1:09:45] he had seen the rehearsal of the future
[1:09:48] and Jesus would be coming into his
[1:09:50] kingdom with the living and with the
[1:09:52] Dead
[1:09:53] and he also knew he never forgot that
[1:09:57] Elias must truly first come and restore
[1:10:02] all things according to Jesus so when
[1:10:04] when you look there at that acts 3 and
[1:10:07] 20 and we can turn there real quickly
[1:10:11] acts acts the third chapter and the 20th
[1:10:14] verse
[1:10:25] Acts 3 and 20.
[1:10:27] when you get there you can say Amen
[1:10:30] praise the Lord
[1:10:33] amen
[1:10:36] we'll wait a little bit longer
[1:10:40] now here cry here Peter is talking to
[1:10:43] the church talking and he's saying
[1:10:47] amen he's the 21st he shall send Jesus
[1:10:51] Christ which was before preached unto
[1:10:54] you whom the Heaven Must receive until
[1:10:58] the times of restitution
[1:11:01] of all things
[1:11:04] which God has spoke by the mouth of his
[1:11:07] holy prophets since the world began so
[1:11:10] how long how long does Jesus have to
[1:11:12] remain in the heavens
[1:11:17] until their times of restitution of all
[1:11:20] things how are these restitution going
[1:11:23] to come behold I send Elijah the prophet
[1:11:27] he'll return the faith is that right
[1:11:29] Jesus said Matthew 17 and 11 Jesus
[1:11:32] answered and said Elias truly shall come
[1:11:34] and restore all things that's that's
[1:11:39] Matthew 17 and 11. he shall first come
[1:11:43] and restore all things what is this this
[1:11:50] Elias
[1:11:52] amen when he appears the son of
[1:11:55] righteousness shall appear with healing
[1:11:57] in his wings
[1:11:58] God is going to come with divine
[1:12:00] revelation can you say Amen now are you
[1:12:04] following me so far
[1:12:06] I bet you kids y'all y'all y'all follow
[1:12:08] me
[1:12:09] amen how many how many understands two
[1:12:12] Elijah's well actually there's five
[1:12:14] Elijah's that come that have already
[1:12:16] come Lenae you know you know which which
[1:12:18] one all those Elijah's are
[1:12:21] take a guess
[1:12:24] the first Elijah what was his name
[1:12:27] Elijah oh you're good
[1:12:30] and the second one
[1:12:32] Elisha and the third one
[1:12:37] what was the third one
[1:12:39] John the Baptist
[1:12:41] and what was the fourth one
[1:12:44] William Branham and then what's the
[1:12:46] fifth one
[1:12:50] it's the Elijah that is to to appear to
[1:12:53] the Jews amen so so Elijah has got a
[1:12:58] special purpose it's a restoration
[1:13:00] Ministry all right now I want us to look
[1:13:02] at Revelations the uh 10th chapter and
[1:13:06] we we read this a lot but I want to read
[1:13:09] it again
[1:13:10] because it's talking about this great
[1:13:13] one this Mighty angel that is to come
[1:13:16] Revelations 10 and 1.
[1:13:27] praise the Lord
[1:13:29] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:13:33] from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:13:36] and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:13:39] and his face were as was as it were the
[1:13:43] son and his feet as pillars of fire now
[1:13:46] once again let's go what would what rev
[1:13:48] what's the Sevenfold personages
[1:13:50] Amanda Sevenfold person wasn't his feet
[1:13:54] as it was in a burning fire amen it was
[1:13:58] like under a brass
[1:14:00] and his face was shining now once again
[1:14:04] this is the mighty angel now this is not
[1:14:07] this is not Christ in his physical form
[1:14:11] although Christ will come in his
[1:14:14] physical form but this is the anointing
[1:14:17] the divine revelation the angel of the
[1:14:20] Covenant it's the same Angel it's the
[1:14:24] same Christ the same Living Word that
[1:14:27] was with the children of Israel in in
[1:14:29] the Old Testament amen that same Angel
[1:14:32] of the Covenant is right here
[1:14:34] and and so the the uh uh rainbow was
[1:14:39] over his head has his face as as it were
[1:14:44] the son his feet as pillars of fire now
[1:14:47] he's got a purpose for his coming
[1:14:51] he's got a purpose for this coming
[1:14:54] there's going to be a literal light when
[1:14:57] we see him face to face I believe we'll
[1:14:59] see that that glory of the Lord
[1:15:03] but there is a light that is shining in
[1:15:07] this day
[1:15:09] son
[1:15:11] estness with healing in his wings that
[1:15:14] have come to prepare the way of the Lord
[1:15:19] that's called the shout
[1:15:21] the Bible says as he's descending there
[1:15:23] would be a shout there would be a voice
[1:15:25] and there would be the Trump of God now
[1:15:29] the shout was that messenger or God
[1:15:34] coming down to a prophet Ministry saying
[1:15:36] prepare yeeds away of the Lord
[1:15:41] he is coming
[1:15:43] be prepared
[1:15:45] amen so now let's let's let's watch
[1:15:48] because we're going to connect we're
[1:15:50] going to see now now keep this in mind
[1:15:52] uh sometimes we we we see everything
[1:15:55] that the angel said and this kind of
[1:15:57] thing like that but remember the Angels
[1:15:59] coming to Earth for a purpose
[1:16:02] watch what that angel does watch what
[1:16:04] that angel does all right so it says uh
[1:16:08] the second verse and he had in his hand
[1:16:10] a little book open
[1:16:13] and he set his right foot upon C and is
[1:16:15] left upon the Earth cried with a loud
[1:16:18] voice as when a lion roared and when he
[1:16:21] had cried seven Thunders uttered their
[1:16:23] voices
[1:16:24] and when the seven Thunders had entered
[1:16:25] the voices I was about to write and I
[1:16:27] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[1:16:30] seal up those things which the seven
[1:16:32] Thunders uttered and write them not
[1:16:36] and the angel which I saw stand on the
[1:16:39] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[1:16:42] hand and swear by him that liveth
[1:16:44] forever and ever who created heaven and
[1:16:47] the things that therein are and the
[1:16:49] Earth and things that are there are the
[1:16:52] sea and things which are therein that
[1:16:55] time should be no longer
[1:16:58] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:17:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:17:05] sound
[1:17:06] amen the mystery of God should be
[1:17:10] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:17:14] servants the prophets
[1:17:17] amen so now what's the connection he
[1:17:19] came down with a purpose
[1:17:23] what was that purpose what's what
[1:17:24] happened
[1:17:26] he came down and gave the book
[1:17:30] to the angel the mighty or the Earthly
[1:17:33] Angel so Christ the anointing came down
[1:17:36] to the Elijah
[1:17:39] and he gave he gave the cry he pointed
[1:17:43] our hearts back to
[1:17:46] the the fathers and he showed us what
[1:17:49] God's purpose and plan was
[1:17:51] amen now again
[1:17:53] the Bible says so as it was in the days
[1:17:56] of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing
[1:17:59] of the son of man
[1:18:01] amen this is not the physical coming of
[1:18:04] Christ but this was prophet God in flesh
[1:18:08] Among Us the word
[1:18:10] manifesting himself praise the Lord
[1:18:18] yes yes you you can now now that that
[1:18:24] cloud is not Christ
[1:18:27] there is not Jesus Jesus has a physical
[1:18:31] body
[1:18:32] but this here A man was was the cloud
[1:18:36] you know
[1:18:38] while we're talking about the cloud did
[1:18:40] you know that the scripture says that
[1:18:42] that a cloud
[1:18:44] Cloud receive Jesus up into the heavens
[1:18:49] amen praise the Lord
[1:18:53] and and I I I was I was wondering here
[1:18:56] um they're in they're in Luke
[1:18:59] I think it's Luke 21. let's look here at
[1:19:01] Luke 21 real quick
[1:19:03] well well what we're talking about the
[1:19:05] cloud uh we'll
[1:19:07] we'll uh we'll just look at this real
[1:19:10] quick
[1:19:12] Luke 21
[1:19:16] and 25.
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:29] and he's given the signs of his coming
[1:19:31] and there shall be signs in the sun in
[1:19:33] the moon and the stars and the Earth
[1:19:35] upon the Earth distress of nations with
[1:19:37] perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring
[1:19:40] how many can say that that this has
[1:19:42] happened in our day
[1:19:45] men's Hearts failing them for fear
[1:19:48] and for looking after those things which
[1:19:50] are coming on the earth for the powers
[1:19:52] of Heavens shall be shaken the powers of
[1:19:54] Heaven these these are all the all of
[1:19:58] the
[1:19:59] politicians these are the Kings these
[1:20:02] are these are preachers those that are
[1:20:05] set up in high places
[1:20:06] amount everything is shaken you know you
[1:20:10] can't even go you can't even go to the
[1:20:12] um to a concert I was telling dad you
[1:20:15] know I was reading reading on the news
[1:20:16] been been seeing these guys where where
[1:20:18] you got you know these country concerts
[1:20:20] or rock and roll or whatever but but
[1:20:22] these guys the fans are throwing stuff
[1:20:25] there on the on the stage throwing hard
[1:20:28] objects at these guys and and their
[1:20:30] hurdles some of us had to have stitches
[1:20:33] and to wear that uh uh I had read were
[1:20:37] there was a country star was out
[1:20:39] performing the other day and and it got
[1:20:42] so much into his mind about what could
[1:20:44] well I guess that's what happened but he
[1:20:46] he struggled through a song and then and
[1:20:48] then ran off the stage
[1:20:50] close the whole concert down and it you
[1:20:54] know until they no one can enjoy
[1:20:56] themselves anymore because they you
[1:20:57] don't they're throwing you know so so
[1:21:00] there's this girl Miranda whoever uh I
[1:21:03] don't I don't know her but the night she
[1:21:05] was performing and someone just got up
[1:21:08] someone just got up and was taking a
[1:21:09] selfie you know not not she wasn't even
[1:21:11] getting storm stage or nothing taking a
[1:21:13] picture of her and she just chewed that
[1:21:15] woman out just tell it don't you knowing
[1:21:18] this we want safety and and and and the
[1:21:21] girl didn't even do anything but but but
[1:21:23] this is where it's everyone's fearful
[1:21:27] for what's coming on
[1:21:30] we're living in that day but look at
[1:21:33] what God has given us now watch this it
[1:21:36] says uh uh man's heart's failing for
[1:21:38] fear looking for things coming
[1:21:40] Heaven shall be shaken the seventh 27th
[1:21:43] verse and they shall see the son of man
[1:21:45] coming in a cloud singular with power
[1:21:48] and great glory and when these things
[1:21:51] begin to come to pass then look up lift
[1:21:55] up your head for your Redemption draw a
[1:21:58] nigh now I I believe that the revealing
[1:22:02] there is a there there there's two
[1:22:05] things that have been promised there is
[1:22:06] the revealing of the son of man and
[1:22:09] there is the coming of the son of man
[1:22:11] amen the revealing of the son of man has
[1:22:14] been promised to the elect as Sodom is
[1:22:17] preparing to burn it was prophet God in
[1:22:21] a body that came to Abraham discerned
[1:22:25] his thoughts and gave him the words to
[1:22:28] change his his body
[1:22:31] amen gave him those words of Promise
[1:22:33] gave him his own name to change his his
[1:22:36] body amen so so those clouds amen what
[1:22:42] what about what what about that
[1:22:43] scripture and and we understand that
[1:22:46] cloud was made up of angels
[1:22:48] what about there in in Thessalonians uh
[1:22:51] one and seven sister keys
[1:22:53] amen and um this is talking about uh
[1:22:59] uh is that is that not it
[1:23:03] maybe maybe second Thessalonians 1 and
[1:23:05] 7.
[1:23:10] yeah uh let's let's go up to the fifth
[1:23:12] verse
[1:23:14] and his manifest tokens righteous
[1:23:15] Judgment of God that ye may be counted
[1:23:17] worthy of the kingdom of God for uh
[1:23:19] which he also suffer
[1:23:22] seeing it as a righteous thing with God
[1:23:24] to recompense tribulation to them that
[1:23:26] trouble you
[1:23:27] do and to you who are troubled rest with
[1:23:30] us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed
[1:23:33] from heaven with his mighty angels
[1:23:37] and in flaming fire taking Vengeance on
[1:23:40] them that know not God that obey not the
[1:23:43] gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ so so I
[1:23:47] you know I I personally believe that
[1:23:49] this right here the revealing revealing
[1:23:52] himself with the mighty Angels revealing
[1:23:55] I think I you know uh your opinion is
[1:23:58] good is just as good as mine on this on
[1:24:00] this right here but I I believe we have
[1:24:03] seen the revealing of Christ in this
[1:24:06] last day with these Mighty angels and
[1:24:09] what is that to do to give to give a
[1:24:13] peace to those of us amen that are
[1:24:16] looking for that for that Rapture of the
[1:24:19] church is that right amen so so we we as
[1:24:24] as we look here at this mysterious one
[1:24:27] as we look at this at at that light that
[1:24:31] was shining his face whereas the Sun and
[1:24:34] while and while while even dealing with
[1:24:36] the uh with the cloud you know some
[1:24:39] people say that the cloud is you know
[1:24:43] um
[1:24:44] is irrelevant but I I tend to believe
[1:24:48] and again I I do believe that that uh
[1:24:53] there will be a revealing of Christ in
[1:24:56] his physical form but I do not believe
[1:24:59] that that was that was exactly what they
[1:25:02] were what God was talking about in
[1:25:04] Revelations 10 and 1. that Mighty Angel
[1:25:07] was the anointing the logos of God
[1:25:11] coming down to a prophet
[1:25:14] and when that Prof when that word came
[1:25:16] to that Prophet then he preached
[1:25:19] indictment then he brought
[1:25:22] a curse to the world and you watch after
[1:25:25] 1962 1963 you you'll see that the
[1:25:29] world's systems just progressively went
[1:25:31] they just started tanking is because a
[1:25:34] prophet was on the scene
[1:25:36] speaking the word of God it was a light
[1:25:39] to the elect but it was judgment unto uh
[1:25:44] unto the world Amen
[1:25:47] so brother Branham would say I I just I
[1:25:50] just got a few here and it's it's
[1:25:51] something that you had mentioned that uh
[1:25:53] about the cloud because uh he says in
[1:25:57] the reproach for the word there in 62 he
[1:25:59] was talking about the vision he says you
[1:26:02] I can just see them with their heads
[1:26:04] kind of turned sideways and those wings
[1:26:06] tipped back full armored and here they
[1:26:09] come like that and just just come right
[1:26:14] down and took me right into the Pyramid
[1:26:15] of a consolation of them and I seen I
[1:26:18] was lift up off the ground and I thought
[1:26:21] maybe I heard way in the distance that
[1:26:23] Roar that womb like a plane when it
[1:26:26] crosses the sound barrier and you you've
[1:26:28] heard it happen just like a distant Roar
[1:26:31] another place he says it shook the Earth
[1:26:34] and when it did I was still looking
[1:26:36] Westward Way off into eternity I saw a
[1:26:38] constellation of something come and it
[1:26:41] looked like it might have been little
[1:26:42] dots there could have been no less than
[1:26:46] five and not more than seven and they
[1:26:48] were in the shape of a pyramid like
[1:26:50] these Messengers coming
[1:26:52] and when it did the power of almighty
[1:26:54] God lifted me up to meet them and it's
[1:26:57] never left me eight days has gone and I
[1:27:00] can't forget it yet I never had anything
[1:27:04] to bother me like that has my family
[1:27:07] will tell you I could see those angels
[1:27:10] those shaped back Wings traveling faster
[1:27:13] than sound could travel they came from
[1:27:16] eternity in a split like the twinkling
[1:27:18] of an eye not any not enough to bat your
[1:27:22] eye just to twinkle and they were there
[1:27:24] I didn't have time to count I I didn't
[1:27:27] have time no no more than just look
[1:27:29] these Mighty ones great powerful angels
[1:27:33] Snow White Wings set in heads and and
[1:27:37] they were they were
[1:27:39] and and when it did I was caught up into
[1:27:42] this pyramid of constellation and I
[1:27:44] thought now this is it I was numbed all
[1:27:47] over and I said oh my this means that
[1:27:49] there will be a blast that will kill me
[1:27:51] I'm at the end of my road I mustn't and
[1:27:53] tell my people when this Vision leaves I
[1:27:56] don't want them to know about it but the
[1:27:58] heavenly father has let me know now that
[1:28:00] my time is finished I won't tell my
[1:28:01] family so so they'll worry about me uh
[1:28:04] because he's fixing to go and and these
[1:28:07] angels have come for me and and I'll be
[1:28:09] killed pretty soon now in some kind of
[1:28:11] an explosion then it came to me while I
[1:28:14] was in the constellation no that isn't
[1:28:17] it if it would have killed you it would
[1:28:20] have killed Joseph and I could hear
[1:28:21] Joseph calling me well then I turned
[1:28:24] around and I thought Lord God what does
[1:28:26] this vision mean and I wondered and then
[1:28:28] it come to me not a voice just just come
[1:28:31] to me oh that is the angels of the Lord
[1:28:34] to give me my new commission and when I
[1:28:37] thought that I raised my hands up and I
[1:28:40] said Lord Jesus what will you have me to
[1:28:42] do and the vision left me for almost an
[1:28:45] hour I could not feel
[1:28:48] amen now so here so here here we have it
[1:28:54] now I'm not going to keep you long but I
[1:28:55] want to the face shining as the sun now
[1:28:58] remember this coming of the Lord or this
[1:29:02] revealing of the Lord this Mighty angel
[1:29:05] that came down came with an open book
[1:29:09] he came with an open book he came with
[1:29:12] divine revelation we are in the
[1:29:15] spiritual coming of the word it's that
[1:29:18] word coming of Christ
[1:29:22] to point us to the physical coming that
[1:29:25] is to be upon us is that right second
[1:29:28] Corinthians you don't have turned there
[1:29:30] but second Corinthians 4 and 6 is for
[1:29:32] God
[1:29:32] who commanded the lie to shine out of
[1:29:35] Darkness hath shined in our hearts to
[1:29:38] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:29:41] glory of God
[1:29:43] in the face
[1:29:45] of Jesus Christ so what what did God
[1:29:48] what did this seventh angel do he
[1:29:52] pointed us to the light of all lights
[1:29:56] he pointed us to that word
[1:29:59] amen
[1:30:01] now we're in the Rapture time this is
[1:30:04] fixing to come where that we're going to
[1:30:06] be in that city where the lamb will be
[1:30:08] the light
[1:30:11] but right now Hallelujah there's a
[1:30:14] restoration time and restoration time
[1:30:16] requires light it requires light and so
[1:30:19] God has has given us that and and we're
[1:30:21] going to get into those other things a
[1:30:23] little bit later on but I just wanted to
[1:30:24] bring this in to you now how many of you
[1:30:27] kids can understand uh you all
[1:30:29] understand where I'm coming from
[1:30:31] or not give me anyone have any questions
[1:30:34] or comments you want to add to that
[1:30:37] here tonight
[1:30:42] early on
[1:30:44] you know 17 year old boy coming into the
[1:30:47] message
[1:30:49] and then my personal Bible study yeah
[1:30:52] and listening to the tapes
[1:30:55] and just just to say I I tried to listen
[1:31:00] to at least the tape a day you know yeah
[1:31:03] yeah
[1:31:05] what really hit me
[1:31:09] uh one just it's a simple scripture and
[1:31:12] you might put it up there in a second uh
[1:31:16] trying to sort out the set of the
[1:31:19] multiple comings of Elijah
[1:31:24] is Luke 1 17. okay yeah yeah can you put
[1:31:29] that up there
[1:31:31] and that is a good one
[1:31:33] showed me that yeah before I the message
[1:31:38] that came to me
[1:31:40] just a personal revelation
[1:31:43] and that just really touched my heart
[1:31:45] yes you know that I could see the the
[1:31:49] separate comments especially from the
[1:31:52] before before the first coming of Elijah
[1:31:55] I mean first coming of Christ and the
[1:31:58] second coming amen but that that
[1:32:00] explains the coming of that's John the
[1:32:05] Baptist
[1:32:07] right it doesn't say that that John the
[1:32:11] Baptist will turn the heart of the
[1:32:13] children to the fathers you know see it
[1:32:15] stops there where it says
[1:32:17] the spirit and power of Elijah's to turn
[1:32:20] the heart of the fathers to the children
[1:32:22] so and then it goes to something else it
[1:32:26] doesn't say the heart of the children to
[1:32:28] the fathers that's right so that just
[1:32:31] something that just really
[1:32:34] hit me strong as a 17 year old boy it's
[1:32:37] just never left me you know and so it
[1:32:40] really helped me yeah
[1:32:42] yeah that I could see that that was John
[1:32:44] the Baptist and that the one that would
[1:32:46] turn the hearts of the the children back
[1:32:49] to the fathers would be a another coming
[1:32:52] of Elijah yes yes you know and and
[1:32:56] that's the thing because the the even
[1:32:58] the disciples
[1:33:01] um
[1:33:02] everyone in that day was looking for the
[1:33:04] Messiah to come
[1:33:06] to to as a conqueror as a conqueror to
[1:33:10] to rid them of Rome they were under
[1:33:13] Rome's bondage
[1:33:15] and so they had a hard time
[1:33:17] understanding but there had to be the
[1:33:20] lamb and then there had to be the the
[1:33:24] the line there had to be the one that
[1:33:26] paid the price there had to be the one
[1:33:28] that comes to claim and so if you look
[1:33:31] there uh put that back up there sister
[1:33:33] khalilah
[1:33:34] um they're in in one in 17 it it it it
[1:33:39] it goes back it's quoting the scripture
[1:33:41] then he shall go before him in the
[1:33:43] spirit and the power of Elias to turn
[1:33:45] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:33:47] children and here it is and then Jesus
[1:33:51] stops and then the the disobedient uh to
[1:33:55] the to the wisd wisdom of the wise
[1:33:57] talking about Redeemer that was uh
[1:34:01] pointing pointing them to the Redeemer
[1:34:03] that was to come but now here we stand
[1:34:06] and this is where Jesus was trying to to
[1:34:10] in in that Matthew the seventh or
[1:34:13] Matthew where I I had first started off
[1:34:16] Elias must come and restore but I say
[1:34:20] Elias has come
[1:34:23] and they killed him amen
[1:34:26] so so y'all understand that
[1:34:29] and the reason that is so important
[1:34:32] is because the their
[1:34:35] um a lot of people want to want to put
[1:34:37] that scripture they want they take that
[1:34:40] scripture right there and say we don't
[1:34:43] need any Elijah in this day
[1:34:45] and so because that was fulfilled in
[1:34:48] Jesus that and because that's he's
[1:34:49] quoting he's quoting there in Malachi 4
[1:34:53] and 6.
[1:34:55] but he stops right in the mid-sentence
[1:34:58] to finish let's let's look at something
[1:35:00] else just real quickly
[1:35:02] and then we'll then we'll wrap it up uh
[1:35:06] uh the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:35:08] let's let's look at that one that's a
[1:35:10] good one for for us to to see where is
[1:35:13] that at
[1:35:14] um
[1:35:15] that's what is that Luke
[1:35:19] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:35:27] Luke 4.
[1:35:33] uh
[1:35:43] yes and uh the 18th verse
[1:35:46] hmm
[1:35:51] and this the spirit
[1:35:53] of the and someone else find that while
[1:35:55] we're while we're doing this we're uh
[1:35:57] that is an eye what is that Isaiah
[1:36:00] Isaiah 6 huh
[1:36:03] it seemed like it's 61. so someone would
[1:36:07] be looking for that one too and then
[1:36:08] we'll we'll compare the scriptures the
[1:36:10] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:36:13] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:36:14] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:36:16] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:36:19] the captives recovering of sight to the
[1:36:21] blind to set at Liberty them that are
[1:36:23] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[1:36:27] the Lord and he closed the book
[1:36:31] gave it back to the minister
[1:36:33] and sat down
[1:36:35] and all uh and the eyes of all them that
[1:36:38] were in the synagogue were fastened on
[1:36:40] him and he began to say unto them this
[1:36:43] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:36:47] ears now let's see what what scripture
[1:36:50] is fulfilled let's go back and look
[1:36:51] there in Isaiah
[1:36:56] 51 61 yeah
[1:37:02] all right
[1:37:03] and that'd be good for you kids to turn
[1:37:06] to too but keep if if you haven't
[1:37:08] already keep keep the scripture we just
[1:37:10] read
[1:37:11] open if not you can you can do it later
[1:37:15] but I want to I want you all to compare
[1:37:17] Isaiah 61
[1:37:21] and one
[1:37:30] amen the spirit of the Lord God is upon
[1:37:34] me because the Lord hath anointed me to
[1:37:36] preach Good Tidings into the meek he has
[1:37:39] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[1:37:42] Proclaim Liberty to the captives the
[1:37:44] opening of the prison to them that are
[1:37:46] bound
[1:37:47] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:37:50] Lord now watch
[1:37:52] Jesus stops right there in the middle of
[1:37:55] the verse closes up the book and says
[1:37:58] this day this scripture is fulfilled now
[1:38:01] some of us would be saying hey
[1:38:03] you don't you don't stop in the middle
[1:38:06] of a verse
[1:38:07] well first of all they didn't have
[1:38:08] verses back then but
[1:38:11] but it is he stops mid-sentence
[1:38:15] the sentence is not over
[1:38:18] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:38:21] Lord he closes the book hands it back
[1:38:24] and says this day this scripture is
[1:38:27] fulfilled
[1:38:29] and he leaves out the day of Vengeance
[1:38:31] to comfort all that mourn can anyone
[1:38:34] tell me why he done that
[1:38:37] it wasn't for the first coming
[1:38:40] the first coming he was the lamb Second
[1:38:44] Coming he's coming as king the judge he
[1:38:48] is coming with vengeance
[1:38:50] that scripture could not be fulfilled
[1:38:52] that day so he stopped mid-sentence said
[1:38:56] this part of the scripture is fulfilled
[1:38:58] this other is still waiting
[1:39:00] there is the same explanation on on John
[1:39:04] how we get the two coming or the two
[1:39:07] comings of Elijah at the first coming
[1:39:09] and the second coming one is to turn the
[1:39:13] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:39:16] and it stopped
[1:39:19] that's what we just read it stopped it
[1:39:21] did not say and turned the hearts of the
[1:39:23] children to the fathers because that was
[1:39:25] for that John the first coming of or the
[1:39:29] the the the the
[1:39:31] John the the third coming of Elijah and
[1:39:35] this other is for
[1:39:36] the fourth coming of Elijah
[1:39:39] you girls understand that no
[1:39:42] see Jesus it's Jesus both ways
[1:39:46] this is the same this is the same Jesus
[1:39:48] and the same Jesus
[1:39:51] but this was the first time he come to
[1:39:53] Earth this is his second time
[1:39:58] there is a John that is to turn the
[1:40:00] hearts of the Bible of the guys that's
[1:40:03] going to write the Bible and be the
[1:40:05] leaders to turn them to Christ
[1:40:08] we don't need we don't God's not raising
[1:40:10] up uh uh new disciples to write Bibles
[1:40:14] anymore now God sends us Elijah to point
[1:40:17] us back
[1:40:19] to what God had originally done to those
[1:40:21] fathers you see that or no
[1:40:25] you kids understand
[1:40:27] Hallelujah any questions comments
[1:40:32] praise the Lord
[1:40:35] amen
[1:40:37] I I believe that the that that cloud has
[1:40:40] has a lot of significance we don't
[1:40:42] worship that cloud that cloud is not
[1:40:45] Christ
[1:40:46] but but that crowd but to me that cloud
[1:40:50] is is significant because it does
[1:40:53] fulfill promise
[1:40:54] it does fulfill that that that that that
[1:40:57] that rainbow that was over over that uh
[1:41:02] a mighty angel that was none other than
[1:41:05] the Living Word coming to Earth
[1:41:08] with an open book to sh to show you and
[1:41:11] I where we are and what we are in Christ
[1:41:14] is that right
[1:41:16] now some people try to say that was the
[1:41:18] second coming and they've got they've
[1:41:20] got all kinds you know they got all
[1:41:23] kinds of
[1:41:24] of crazy thoughts but they didn't get it
[1:41:26] from Brother Brown amen there is a
[1:41:28] literal body of Jesus Christ and there
[1:41:31] will be a literal
[1:41:33] marriage supper
[1:41:36] man I had a guy telling me that that uh
[1:41:39] that we have we're already in the
[1:41:42] millennium
[1:41:43] that that the coming of Christ has
[1:41:45] already come and and we are feasting at
[1:41:48] the marriage supper of the Lamb right
[1:41:49] now
[1:41:52] Hallelujah I said well what are you
[1:41:53] going to do when it's when brother
[1:41:54] Branham says and it'll be miles long
[1:41:57] no there ain't gonna be no miles long
[1:42:00] table I said yes there will there's a
[1:42:02] literal body there will be a literal
[1:42:05] marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:42:07] and I've got a place reserved right
[1:42:10] there at the table
[1:42:11] amen
[1:42:15] huh
[1:42:18] that's right that's right we're all
[1:42:20] going to be young
[1:42:21] hallelujah amen
[1:42:24] that even ties into the reason that we
[1:42:28] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:29] Christ we're not just baptizing up to
[1:42:32] the anointing of Christ yes you're
[1:42:35] baptizing into the body of Jesus Amen
[1:42:39] that was sacrificed
[1:42:40] and raised back for us you're not just
[1:42:43] baptizing in the name of Jesus because
[1:42:44] there are many jesuses but there's one
[1:42:47] Lord Jesus Christ and that physical Lord
[1:42:50] Jesus Christ has to come back not just
[1:42:52] an anointing in a cloud with a physical
[1:42:54] Lord Jesus Christ has to come back again
[1:42:57] amen that's exactly right that's exactly
[1:43:01] right and you can't you can't mix you
[1:43:03] you can't mix that up you you if you if
[1:43:06] you do you're you're missing you're
[1:43:08] messing with scripture and you can't
[1:43:10] take any Revelation that brother Branham
[1:43:12] had
[1:43:13] and uh and and and and and go off go off
[1:43:17] the seed with it if brother Branham said
[1:43:20] things he said it for a purpose not to
[1:43:22] make new doctrines he said this to make
[1:43:25] things easier like the bride coming of
[1:43:27] Christ he's letting he's you know we're
[1:43:29] in the bright age well that doesn't mean
[1:43:32] there's only Seven Ages there's not
[1:43:34] eight ages there's only Seven Ages but
[1:43:38] yet brother Branham to let you know and
[1:43:41] to separate you from this evil God
[1:43:45] forsaken age he says he's lifted you
[1:43:49] into the bright age
[1:43:51] that doesn't if you got eight ages now
[1:43:54] you got to have the eighth messenger and
[1:43:56] then we've got too many guys clamoring
[1:43:58] to be that messenger we got everybody
[1:44:00] there's no we we there's only seven
[1:44:03] Messengers
[1:44:04] our age seventh age is William Branham
[1:44:08] that is our messenger

[1:46:07] third
[1:46:09] Eden
[1:46:11] The Mystery of the Rapture is in

[1:46:27] me do this I'm going too fast
[1:46:32] what's the next
[1:46:34] voice preeminence
[1:46:43] what's the third
[1:46:46] catching away
[1:46:53] Revelation is the shout
[1:46:58] God in Christ the revealing of himself
[1:47:01] preeminence in the church The Voice the
[1:47:04] word having preeminence in US
[1:47:06] Eden rapture
[1:47:08] catching away rapture
[1:47:11] amen
[1:47:13] all right brother Branham said the
[1:47:15] seventh seal is in threefold
[1:47:18] what is the threefold and I and I messed
[1:47:21] it all up here I'm gonna I'm gonna put
[1:47:22] this I'm gonna erase this what is What
[1:47:25] is the threefold
[1:47:27] can y'all remember
[1:47:38] the fenders
[1:47:39] everything was in symbol the Thunders
[1:47:41] brother Branham says the fun they asked
[1:47:43] for the brand of the Thunders revealed
[1:47:45] brother Branham says the Thunders are
[1:47:48] the revelations contained in the Seven
[1:47:50] Seals so we're not looking for the
[1:47:52] Thunders to come in the future the
[1:47:54] Thunders is is the voice of God that
[1:47:56] revealed the word of God so the
[1:48:00] Revelation this is the Revelation number
[1:48:02] two what was what was what was number
[1:48:05] two brother Brandon Salem seven seal he
[1:48:07] said the seventh seal is the third pool
[1:48:10] under that seventh seal was the third
[1:48:12] pool
[1:48:16] what is the third poll
[1:48:18] message
[1:48:23] preeminence
[1:48:26] all right
[1:48:27] what's the third he said now there on
[1:48:30] the third he says it's a threefold
[1:48:31] manner he said I've seen the one unfold
[1:48:34] I've seen the second one unfold today
[1:48:36] but the third one came in an unknown
[1:48:39] tongue and I couldn't make it out
[1:48:42] he said that will be right at his coming
[1:48:46] that will be the body change the
[1:48:49] catching away no man knows the hour
[1:48:55] are you seeing
[1:48:57] the rapture
[1:48:59] the threefold purpose
[1:49:01] and uh uh uh uh and and this and the
[1:49:06] seventh seal is all the same thing it's
[1:49:09] in a threefold manner
[1:49:11] are y'all catching it
[1:49:13] revelation
[1:49:15] preeminence of that word in the cry
[1:49:18] revelation of who God is revelation
[1:49:20] that's what brother Brandon said come
[1:49:22] back come back come back Revelation amen
[1:49:25] that's what the Thunders were yet open
[1:49:27] it up it revealed and then the
[1:49:29] preeminence or the word the message
[1:49:32] taking root in the church and then all
[1:49:35] three of them is going back to Eden
[1:49:37] they're catching away the resurrection
[1:49:39] and then and then of course uh uh uh the
[1:49:43] the the the last phase of the seventh
[1:49:46] seal so the seventh seal when people
[1:49:49] when brother Brandon would say no the
[1:49:50] seven seal is not open
[1:49:53] it's the same thing as people are trying
[1:49:55] to tell us that the Rapture has not
[1:49:57] begun the Rapture has begun
[1:50:01] now when we say we're in Rapture they're
[1:50:03] going to say they all look at you and
[1:50:05] say you are crazy right well the Rapture
[1:50:08] is not totally over it's a shout the
[1:50:12] shout has come the preeminence the word
[1:50:15] is having its effect within us brother
[1:50:17] Bradham says what we need is thousands
[1:50:20] of Living Voices that are thundering out
[1:50:22] the word of God living in sweetness and
[1:50:25] humility the word having preeminence is
[1:50:28] that right but the third face will be at
[1:50:31] the coming of the Lord when he takes us
[1:50:33] back and that will be the literal return
[1:50:36] and and and and some Knuckleheads try to
[1:50:39] make it make it more complicated than
[1:50:41] that but that's that's exactly the way
[1:50:43] that the Lord or that's that's exactly
[1:50:45] the way brother Branham taught it
[1:50:47] amen and so when you look at those well
[1:50:50] then it's then there's no more confusing
[1:50:52] about it there had to be a shout saying
[1:50:55] come out
[1:50:56] and then there had to be a surrender to
[1:50:58] that word
[1:50:59] and then the body change is coming next
[1:51:02] amen
[1:51:04] and by the way the seventh seal is just
[1:51:06] the seven silver the brand so that seven
[1:51:09] seal is going to be it's it's it's like
[1:51:11] that Roman candle that Jesus keeps on
[1:51:12] going amen it'll be the total he says
[1:51:15] it'll be the ending of time it'll be the
[1:51:17] total ending of everything Hallelujah we
[1:51:19] still have a millennium here on the
[1:51:20] earth that is still a part of that time
[1:51:22] there will be an unfolding even after
[1:51:24] work caught away from here praise the
[1:51:26] Lord but I'm so glad I'm so glad that I
[1:51:29] am I'm out of this place the light has
[1:51:33] come and I say the radiance of this
[1:51:36] mighty one is so Supreme and so Eternal
[1:51:39] is that right
[1:51:41] if you haven't seen
[1:51:43] if you haven't seen the light of this
[1:51:45] word
[1:51:46] you'll never see him in the light of
[1:51:49] that City
[1:51:50] but it's seeing him here that's where
[1:51:53] it's all that's that's that sealing your
[1:51:55] way into the kingdom of God any
[1:51:57] questions

[1:52:18] and if the musicians would come
[1:52:24] praise the Lord
[1:52:27] well so his face as uh shines as the sun
[1:52:32] Hallelujah I'm glad I've seen his face
[1:52:37] I'm glad I'm glad that God's made it
[1:52:39] made it so real
[1:52:42] I'm glad his word is is living it's a
[1:52:45] reality

[1:52:49] every one of us
[1:52:51] oh God let the word let the word have
[1:52:53] preeminence in me
[1:52:55] if we're going to see a body change
[1:52:56] there's got to be a preeminence
[1:52:59] amen go go go back and listen to what
[1:53:01] brother Branham had had said there in
[1:53:04] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:53:07] the whole purpose the whole purpose
[1:53:10] God revealing himself God in Christ now
[1:53:14] all that was in God God emptied all of
[1:53:18] himself in Christ
[1:53:20] all that was in Christ he has all
[1:53:22] emptied himself in the church
[1:53:24] that he might have preeminence within us

[1:55:26] let's be fervent about this word that he
[1:55:28] come
[1:55:32] too many places where brother Branham
[1:55:34] said now

[1:56:08] it doesn't that's not necessarily
[1:56:09] talking about a religious a religious

[2:07:40] so uh uh
[2:07:42] listen
[2:07:43] I'd encourage you you you young people I
[2:07:46] know you don't want extra schooling but
[2:07:49] I would say
[2:07:50] you know really
[2:07:53] really spend some devotional time in
[2:07:55] Reading even if you read in
[2:07:57] a couple of pages a day
[2:08:00] and um brother brother Merle says that
[2:08:03] when he was 17 he was listening he tried
[2:08:05] to listen to a tape today a day
[2:08:07] [Music]
[2:08:08] I you can't really
[2:08:10] you can't really uh
[2:08:13] I have found in myself
[2:08:15] you can rush through them if you're
[2:08:16] trying to listen to one whole tape a day
[2:08:18] you miss out a lot I would rather you
[2:08:21] catch what the prophet is trying to say
[2:08:23] even if you do it
[2:08:25] I mean listen to the whole tape that day
[2:08:27] but then listen to it again the next day
[2:08:28] you know and listen to that listen to
[2:08:31] that same tape for a week and just and
[2:08:34] you know that's that's me you don't have
[2:08:37] to you can listen to one tape and uh
[2:08:40] separate tape a day but if if it's
[2:08:42] something that you're
[2:08:44] you didn't quite catch go back and
[2:08:45] listen to it again it ain't we're not
[2:08:47] we're not getting trophies or stars for
[2:08:50] how many tapes we listen to and God's
[2:08:52] not gonna say okay how many taped
[2:08:54] messages did you listen to when you was
[2:08:56] on Earth so but he does want you
[2:08:59] to catch what the prophet is saying
[2:09:03] that's important is that right so listen
[2:09:07] to that message daily I'd encourage you
[2:09:10] to but this this here as we're as we're
[2:09:13] starting to go through the church ages
[2:09:14] I'm not going to be going through the
