[42:11] so good to have brother Merle back home

[42:16] they were gone

[43:01] the invitation to be a part and all of
[43:04] those who amen strive for Brotherhood
[43:08] and and keeping and doing things
[43:10] together I think it's a wonderful thing
[43:12] to
[43:13] one cries we all cry when one rejoices
[43:16] we all rejoice
[43:17] and so we're thankful for that they're
[43:20] in Romans the eighth chapter the 28th
[43:23] verse
[43:24] and we know that all things work
[43:26] together for good to them who that love
[43:30] God to them who are the called according
[43:33] to his purpose
[43:35] for whom he did for no he also did
[43:39] predestinate to be conformed to the
[43:41] image of his son
[43:42] that he might be the firstborn among
[43:44] many brethren
[43:46] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[43:49] he also called
[43:51] whom he called them he also Justified
[43:55] whom he justified then he also glorified
[43:58] now if you'll notice all of this
[44:01] is all in the past tense when did this
[44:04] all happen back up to the 29th verse for
[44:07] whom he did for no them he also did
[44:11] predestinate to be conformed to the
[44:15] image of his son so that when he
[44:18] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[44:21] image of that son that time he called he
[44:26] justified and he glorified
[44:29] 31st verse what shall we say then to
[44:32] these things if God be for us who shall
[44:36] be against us he that spared not his own
[44:39] son but delivered him up for us all how
[44:43] shall we not with him also
[44:46] he shall not with him also freely give
[44:49] us all things who shall lay anything to
[44:52] the charge of God's elect it is God that
[44:54] justifies
[44:55] who is he that condemns it is Christ
[44:58] that died yea rather that is risen again
[45:02] who is even at the right hand of God who
[45:06] also maketh intercession for us
[45:08] who shall separate us from the love of
[45:10] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[45:12] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[45:15] Pearl or sword as it is written for thy
[45:18] sake or we kill all the day long we are
[45:21] accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[45:24] in all these things we are more than
[45:27] conquerors through him that loved us for
[45:29] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[45:32] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[45:35] powers nor things present nor things to
[45:38] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[45:42] creature
[45:43] shall be able to separate us
[45:46] somebody say shall be able to separate
[45:48] us
[45:50] now who is this us
[45:52] those that have been predestinated to be
[45:56] conformed to the image of his son
[46:00] because they're already predestinated
[46:03] they're already called
[46:05] they're already Justified they're
[46:08] already glorified and there is nothing
[46:12] that shall separate us can you say amen
[46:16] amen he says separate us from the love
[46:19] of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[46:23] father we thank you for your love

[47:41] praise the Lord
[47:44] I want to speak for
[47:47] a little while on on the sovereignty of
[47:50] God
[47:51] and um
[47:53] amen The Sovereign God of creation
[47:57] and um
[47:59] in thinking about this this is a this is
[48:01] an incredible this is an incredible
[48:04] thing there's been a lot of debate over
[48:06] the years about
[48:09] uh the man the the reach of man and the
[48:13] the reach of
[48:15] of God and and and where one stops and
[48:18] where one goes and
[48:20] but this morning I want to
[48:22] I want to uh um Minister on on the god
[48:26] of creation the Great
[48:28] Eternal creator
[48:31] and um amen how many believes that God's
[48:34] got a Got A Plan of Redemption
[48:37] every great artist man must see his
[48:42] uh masterpiece
[48:44] before he starts it
[48:47] the details are are made before one blow
[48:51] is even
[48:52] amen struck the the marble it's Iman the
[48:58] details the plans are made the sketches
[49:00] are drawn a model is crafted
[49:03] a man
[49:05] um these days you've got the 3D
[49:07] prototype that's created you the the
[49:12] artist has has got an image of what He
[49:16] is wanting to build he's got it in his
[49:20] mind
[49:21] and he is making that image Amen to come
[49:26] out of his mind and to come upon the
[49:28] marble
[49:29] amen as we think about even Mount
[49:32] Rushmore and and uh gutsenborglum
[49:36] there it took him 14 years to to carve
[49:40] the mountain or the the Masterpiece out
[49:42] of the mountain
[49:44] and um amen 14 years of of of of of
[49:49] faithful work now 14 years that's a man
[49:53] that's that's that's just uh Dylan's
[49:55] only amen he's just two years older than
[49:58] than that uh what it took for the man to
[50:01] build uh to create that masterpiece
[50:05] but it also took four years of
[50:08] preparation that amen the the painful
[50:11] effort amen uh before the actual
[50:15] Masterpiece has even started the
[50:18] preparation that goes into it because
[50:20] every minute detail has to be gone
[50:24] through beforehand amen every every
[50:27] detail has got to be there they had to
[50:29] sample the Rocks they had to sample the
[50:31] amen uh they had to play around with a
[50:34] dynamite they had to do these these
[50:38] things to to ensure that once they
[50:41] started the project they'd be able to
[50:44] finish the project amen because if you
[50:47] got into it and then you didn't realize
[50:49] uh you didn't for see things ahead of
[50:53] time your project could amen uh be uh be
[50:58] stopped and then millions of dollars be
[51:01] uh wasted and so they had to find the
[51:04] right type of rock the amen they had to
[51:08] have the proper tools they had to have
[51:10] the proper equipment they had to have
[51:13] everything there amen and and when it
[51:16] was ready amen uh having the proper
[51:19] equipment and having the proper sight
[51:21] was was not good enough then they would
[51:24] have to build the busts and so remember
[51:27] this is where uh Berglund would spend a
[51:30] lot of time doing the details and how he
[51:32] was going to put the faces and how much
[51:35] of the men he was going to put on the
[51:36] mountain and amen and which way it would
[51:39] face any amen he he went through this
[51:42] bust after bust and trying to to find
[51:46] the image that he wanted to put up there
[51:50] on that mountain because this is his
[51:53] Masterpiece he was going to take these
[51:56] amen these famous men and and it would
[52:00] it would last um amen through infamy and
[52:03] so we he wanted to uh assure that
[52:09] everything that he'd done a man was
[52:12] taken care of ahead of time before he
[52:15] even struck the first a man the first
[52:18] bit of rock can you say amen amen they
[52:21] when we think of Michelangelo's
[52:23] sculpture of Moses they say Amen that
[52:26] the that that it was a lifetime of work
[52:29] that it it took amen it was it was years
[52:33] and years in the making in his mind as
[52:37] he as he thought about it and working on
[52:39] other projects He had this that he
[52:42] wanted to to uh to bring out into the
[52:46] the public view his version of what
[52:49] Moses would look like amen and and he he
[52:54] would think about it and go through the
[52:56] sketches and amen it went years and
[52:59] years of thinking and and and amen
[53:03] trying this and that and the other
[53:06] before he would he would come in to the
[53:10] amen starting this masterpiece amen that
[53:15] we know today of Michelangelo's
[53:17] sculpture of Moses and it is one of the
[53:20] amen it's one of the fine pieces of art
[53:23] amen and so that he could see the image
[53:27] and it cost him a great deal of his uh
[53:31] of of uh of his time in bringing this
[53:34] together Amen brother Branham would talk
[53:36] about it and he would say only the man
[53:38] the sculpture himself
[53:41] has in his mind what he's trying to do
[53:44] he he is the one you might walk up and
[53:48] say to him now what are you picking on
[53:50] that rock for to The Outsider who
[53:52] doesn't know what's in his mind it's
[53:55] nonsense Amen to The Outsider it says
[53:58] but to the man the sculptor himself he's
[54:02] got a vision in his mind what he's
[54:05] trying to make and what he's trying to
[54:07] reproduce what he has on his mind in the
[54:11] form of a monument and that's the reason
[54:13] he's digging it out of the Rocks Zeke
[54:16] you have to start off right at the
[54:19] beginning you have to follow the pattern
[54:21] you can't get a little a little piece to
[54:23] start off and well we'll make this way
[54:25] now I believe we'll do it this no he's
[54:28] got to have an exact pattern in his mind
[54:32] he's got that pattern and he cannot vary
[54:35] from that pattern now in order to do
[54:38] this he had to draw in his mind and
[54:41] because we have no real picture of Moses
[54:44] for he had to get a mental picture in
[54:47] his mind of exactly what Moses was now a
[54:49] genuine sculptor is inspired like a
[54:52] genuine poet or a genuine singer
[54:54] musician whatever it might be oh Rio has
[54:58] to come by inspiration
[55:00] Michelangelo must have had that
[55:02] inspiration of what Moses really looked
[55:04] like and he caught it in his mind and
[55:07] what Moses must have been so he set
[55:10] forth on this great piece of marble The
[55:13] Cutting of the pattern and bringing down
[55:15] and holding down until he got the real
[55:18] picture of what was in his mind can you
[55:22] say Amen so as we begin to think about
[55:25] God as amen The Sovereign God of
[55:28] creation I want to say there is nothing
[55:31] any greater than God Amen there is no
[55:34] power any greater than God there is no
[55:37] man any greater than God there's no
[55:40] devil or demon that is any greater than
[55:43] God God is supreme
[55:47] and we're not here to glorify the devil
[55:49] this morning we're here to glorify God
[55:51] amen I think that'd be a good idea for
[55:54] every one of us in our lives too we
[55:56] should not be glorifying the devil in
[55:58] our lives let's glorify God in our lives
[56:01] amen glorify God now God as the great
[56:06] Creator I believe that God had had these
[56:10] thoughts eternally in his mind amen I
[56:13] don't believe God's ever had a new
[56:15] thought God is God God has no tomorrows
[56:18] God has no yesterdays God is God God has
[56:22] always been God never had a beginning
[56:24] God will never have an ending amen God
[56:28] is before all things now if God was ever
[56:31] created then God's not God Amen he's not
[56:35] an idol God has always been from
[56:39] eternity to Eternity amen and the Bible
[56:43] says there in Acts 15 and 18 it says
[56:46] known unto God or all somebody say all
[56:52] his works from the beginning of the
[56:56] world Amen that means that means from
[56:58] the very beginning when God said let
[57:03] there be God knew from the beginning
[57:06] Amen to the ending everything and every
[57:11] detail in between
[57:13] God is not learning God's all-knowing
[57:16] God knows your tomorrow God knows what
[57:20] the tribulation is going to be like God
[57:22] knows what the Millennium is going to be
[57:24] like God knows who's going to be said he
[57:27] at the marriage supper of the Lamb God
[57:30] knows all things
[57:35] and if God knows it no wealthy if your
[57:37] God doesn't know all things you'd better
[57:39] change gods and I want to invite you to
[57:42] my God the Living God he lives in the
[57:45] body of Jesus Christ he is forevermore
[57:48] God
[57:49] can you say amen amen that's right there
[57:53] in Hebrews 4 and 2 or 4 and 3 it says
[57:56] for we which have believed do enter into
[58:00] rest as he has said as I have sworn in
[58:03] my wrath if they shall enter into my
[58:05] rest although the works were finished
[58:09] from the foundation of the world now now
[58:11] here he's talking he's talking to a
[58:14] group of people that say we don't
[58:15] believe it he's talking about the people
[58:17] in the wilderness with Moses a man that
[58:19] just constantly belly ate and they died
[58:21] and amen they they can go into the
[58:23] promised land but yet God says my word
[58:27] no matter how much unbelief is in the
[58:30] camp
[58:30] my word will last will stand the works
[58:35] were finished from the foundation of the
[58:38] world
[58:39] so that tells me that God is not doing
[58:42] anything new today
[58:44] God has got a plan and God is working
[58:48] that plan
[58:49] he's working that plan in the world he's
[58:52] working that plan in this church he's
[58:54] working that plan in your life he's
[58:55] working that plan in your family he's
[58:58] working that plan amen he is still God
[59:01] can I hear an amen
[59:04] Amen in all reality
[59:06] God never has a new thought his original
[59:10] thought is the new is the current one
[59:12] now that's hard for us humans to think
[59:13] about amen it's hard for us to really
[59:16] grasp our mind around but God Amen his
[59:20] plan never changes now I also want us to
[59:24] look amen what else now it had to come
[59:27] out of his mind amen but in his thoughts
[59:31] there was a plan and that plan would be
[59:36] something that would go and span the
[59:40] thousands of years amen all the way down
[59:43] into our time I I I believe that the man
[59:48] if God could see something then God
[59:52] could foreordain something
[59:55] amen now God can't change
[59:57] God can't change the Bible says they're
[1:00:00] in Micah 3 and 6 I am the Lord and I
[1:00:04] change not can you say Amen so God is
[1:00:07] unchangeable now I'm trying to get you
[1:00:09] somewhere because I want you to know how
[1:00:11] concrete God is when When God says I
[1:00:14] love you it's a Concrete thought
[1:00:17] Hallelujah God doesn't say I love you
[1:00:19] today and I don't love you tomorrow God
[1:00:22] loves his people
[1:00:25] hallelujah amen his nature is
[1:00:30] unchangeable he will forever remain holy
[1:00:34] he will forever hate sin he will forever
[1:00:37] stand behind his word his word is always
[1:00:41] the same man well praise the Lord you
[1:00:45] know I'm just glad God doesn't do
[1:00:47] anything on the spare of the moment
[1:00:50] Hallelujah now I'm a spare of the moment
[1:00:52] type guy amen hallelujah and uh that's
[1:00:57] just in my nature but God's not spare of
[1:00:58] the moment God's one of those guys that
[1:01:00] thinks it out forever
[1:01:02] amen God wants to make sure that if he
[1:01:04] starts it he's going to be able to
[1:01:06] finish it I'm one of those guys that
[1:01:08] have started plenty of projects that are
[1:01:11] still not finished
[1:01:13] God starts the project and God will end
[1:01:18] the project come on church he that has
[1:01:22] begun a good work in you
[1:01:26] will be faithful to complete it until
[1:01:30] the day of Jesus Christ amen now brother
[1:01:34] Branham would say now before the great
[1:01:35] thought become a word god perceived he
[1:01:39] pre-thought these things before the
[1:01:40] foundation of the world Amen he says
[1:01:43] another place he says the first word the
[1:01:45] man in the beginning was the word the
[1:01:48] word was with God the Word was God now
[1:01:51] before it could be a word it had to be a
[1:01:53] thought cause a word is a thought
[1:01:56] expressed and when God when he seemed
[1:01:59] that the enemy of this world was going

[1:22:01] where we get mixed up is we're living in
[1:22:04] these in these bodies of declare that
[1:22:07] resulted a man from from the fall of

[1:23:29] foreknowledge
[1:23:30] the drawing of the plan is dependent on
[1:23:34] what he has already seen
[1:23:38] and the word spoke
[1:23:42] declares the destiny
[1:23:45] predestinated to be conformed into the

[1:24:34] he was already there
[1:24:38] he's seen you he knew you he decreed you
[1:24:42] and he saved you
[1:24:49] well praise the Lord
[1:24:51] there is not one Speck of scripture
[1:24:55] there is not one Speck of scripture
[1:24:58] that says that you were saved at an
[1:25:00] altar
[1:25:02] find it
[1:25:10] the praise of the Lord
[1:25:13] you were his at the beginning but you
[1:25:18] were in a fallen condition
[1:25:21] Christ came to redeem you
[1:25:29] Hallelujah
[1:25:30] so you didn't get saved at a certain
[1:25:33] time at an altar you always were in
[1:25:36] God's mind
[1:25:38] God had to come up with a plan to redeem
[1:25:42] you you're going there you God had to
[1:25:45] come up with a plan no the plan was
[1:25:47] already there before the foundation of
[1:25:49] the world
[1:25:50] that was also in his mind what you think
[1:25:55] is something that is rocking the apple
[1:25:58] cart
[1:25:59] could actually be part of the plan
[1:26:03] because the scripture says that Jesus
[1:26:06] what the was the lamb slain
[1:26:10] before the foundation of the world so
[1:26:12] before there was a sin before there was
[1:26:14] a serpent before you mean the serpent
[1:26:16] was part of the plan you mean
[1:26:23] yeah stare had not been
[1:26:27] it would not be a redeemer if there are
[1:26:31] not it's been we would not know God in
[1:26:33] his love the way we know him come on
[1:26:36] church we know him today because of what
[1:26:41] we have seen him do to us and through us
[1:26:48] foreign
[1:26:53] Grace
[1:26:57] now do you understand Grace
[1:27:02] okay I'm gonna have to show you some
[1:27:04] scripture Hallelujah that's all right
[1:27:07] I want to show some scripture let's look
[1:27:09] here in Saint John the sixth chapter
[1:27:11] this is full of nuggets in here amen
[1:27:14] do you love him
[1:27:17] now the modern liberal Christian then
[1:27:18] says ha
[1:27:20] ha
[1:27:21] nope
[1:27:23] we have something to do with it
[1:27:25] we have something to do with it
[1:27:27] man
[1:27:30] Kenneth Hagin at one time has made a
[1:27:31] point that he says I I will determine my
[1:27:34] destiny
[1:27:35] now I'm not I'm not quoting him exactly
[1:27:37] but he had said one time amen they had
[1:27:40] in that word of faith movement that you
[1:27:43] can control your destiny by your words
[1:27:46] and and that that he a man would you
[1:27:50] know would be able to uh prolong his
[1:27:53] life by by what he says or he can die
[1:27:56] early by what he says
[1:27:58] while there are some truth to what you
[1:28:02] say and how you say it amen it depends
[1:28:06] on whether you're in the plan of God
[1:28:10] you can say you're going to live to be
[1:28:12] 110 years old but if you're already in
[1:28:15] the plan of God to go at 65
[1:28:18] you ain't going a day further than 65.
[1:28:21] now if there's any 65 year olds in here
[1:28:23] I don't want to scare you I'm just
[1:28:24] that's just the number I pull out them
[1:28:25] out of the sky amen Hallelujah come on
[1:28:30] you're not gonna you're not gonna stick
[1:28:31] around here a day longer than what God's
[1:28:33] already has already decreed
[1:28:36] well praise the Lord
[1:28:39] God's got a plan for you
[1:28:42] enjoy the plan will ya
[1:28:45] enjoy it God's got a plan for your life
[1:28:48] now I'm fixing to get somewhere I can I
[1:28:51] I'm getting somewhere here I'm talking
[1:28:53] about the plan for your salvation God
[1:28:56] really you know here's here's here's the
[1:28:59] deal
[1:29:00] Hallelujah since we got a chalkboard
[1:29:03] so here here is God the pillar of Fire
[1:29:08] and he's up here this this is modern
[1:29:10] Christendom this is what modern people
[1:29:12] think ha
[1:29:15] God's thinking he's seeing all the Lost
[1:29:17] sinners
[1:29:18] and he says all right
[1:29:21] I'm going to send Jesus
[1:29:23] so he come he gets the second person the
[1:29:25] godhead and he says now I'm gonna I want
[1:29:27] you to go down there and I want you to
[1:29:28] die so here comes Jesus he's on he's on
[1:29:32] the cross hands there he's dying
[1:29:36] and then God looks at the Holy Spirit
[1:29:38] the third person of the Trinity he says
[1:29:40] all right now you got to come over here
[1:29:42] now now you've got to go down and
[1:29:45] convince all of these people down here
[1:29:48] you've got to convince all of these
[1:29:50] people down here on Earth
[1:29:51] that Jesus died to save him
[1:29:55] and and because God loves them
[1:29:58] and so the holy spirit is down here very
[1:30:01] defeated
[1:30:05] because laodicea has totally kicked
[1:30:11] the Bible says he's on the outside of
[1:30:13] the church knocking
[1:30:15] now here is laodicea the holy spirit's
[1:30:18] returning back and he's crying to the
[1:30:21] son saying man I'm sorry you died in
[1:30:23] vain they're both going back to the
[1:30:25] father saying my God
[1:30:28] when you have failure oh no one's
[1:30:31] accepting it
[1:30:35] Hallelujah
[1:30:37] amen
[1:30:39] looking for a dry areas
[1:30:40] or we can look at it this way
[1:30:51] the invisible God in his mind before all
[1:30:54] time spaces and Eternity
[1:30:59] before there was oxygen before there was
[1:31:00] water before there was anything before
[1:31:01] you could learn there's even a breath
[1:31:05] God had some thoughts in his mind
[1:31:08] and God spoke and Out Come the logos
[1:31:11] that great Pillar of Fire that Living
[1:31:13] Word
[1:31:14] he would come down and begin to anoint
[1:31:16] you would begin to anoint Prophets
[1:31:19] he would begin to declare
[1:31:22] Iman what he was going to look like
[1:31:25] and he would begin to show The Plan of
[1:31:27] Redemption and God would move in this
[1:31:29] body of Jesus Christ
[1:31:31] Hallelujah
[1:31:35] he's coming for one purpose
[1:31:38] to redeem those
[1:31:41] who were lost
[1:31:46] then God Christ would go back amen
[1:31:49] sitting on the throne or The Mercy Seat
[1:31:52] of intercession and his Same Spirit
[1:31:55] would come
[1:31:56] and would search out
[1:31:58] all that Jesus died for
[1:32:02] you and everyone that Jesus died for
[1:32:08] would be brought back
[1:32:11] to where
[1:32:13] praise the Lord
[1:32:16] are you hearing me
[1:32:18] you say no now now I wish I had some
[1:32:20] scripture on that well I'm glad you
[1:32:22] asked Hallelujah
[1:32:26] you love him
[1:32:30] let's look here let's let's look here at
[1:32:31] John I tell you what
[1:32:33] let's look here at John uh uh
[1:32:40] John 6 and 30. 7
[1:32:43] I brought these scriptures just in case
[1:32:45] I would need them
[1:32:48] amen you love him
[1:32:52] now watch
[1:32:53] this is all part of the plan
[1:32:55] six let's do six and 35 Jesus said unto
[1:32:58] them I am the bread of life he that
[1:33:00] cometh to me shall never hunger he that
[1:33:03] believeth on me shall never thirst but I
[1:33:05] say unto you that ye also have seen me
[1:33:08] and believe not

[1:33:13] religious people

[1:33:18] that the father giveth me
[1:33:21] shall come shall come to me
[1:33:27] I've come to redeem those that are
[1:33:32] already the fathers
[1:33:35] they're down here they cannot get back
[1:33:39] up to here I'm simply the remedy here to
[1:33:44] bring them back and I will attract every
[1:33:49] one of them
[1:33:54] y'all hearing me
[1:33:56] amen now watch now let's let's look here
[1:33:58] he says and him to cometh to me I will

[1:34:05] will of him that's in me this is the
[1:34:07] Father's will which that sent me that of

[1:34:31] me repeat with me say it with me I
[1:34:34] should lose nothing
[1:34:38] it's a fail-proof plan brother God's not
[1:34:41] going to lose
[1:34:50] how could God be so sure
[1:34:52] because at the beginning in the plan God
[1:34:55] spoke the word the predestinated seed
[1:34:57] placed it in your heart in your Fallen
[1:35:00] body in your Fallen
[1:35:03] miserable creature that you are and God
[1:35:07] spoke that word concerning you planted
[1:35:10] it in your heart and there is nothing

[1:35:42] everlasting life
[1:35:43] and I and I will be raised up in the
[1:35:47] last I'll raise them up in the last days
[1:35:48] can you say Amen now let's let's go one
[1:35:50] down
[1:35:51] through the 44th verse
[1:35:55] no man
[1:35:57] punch your neighbor and say no one
[1:36:01] can come to me
[1:36:03] accept the Father which sent me draw him
[1:36:10] so now we're saying there is no one that
[1:36:15] that is sitting here in laodicea can
[1:36:19] come to Christ
[1:36:21] accept it give permission
[1:36:24] by the by the father
[1:36:28] if you're not of him you'll never be
[1:36:31] with him
[1:36:36] amen you kids understand that
[1:36:38] you were in God's mind before the world
[1:36:42] began you say well well
[1:36:45] I don't know about that predestinated
[1:36:47] seed I do
[1:36:51] let's read the next verse hallelujah
[1:36:53] hallelujah
[1:36:55] and I will raise him up the last day
[1:36:56] 45th verse it is written in the prophets
[1:36:59] they shall be taught they shall all
[1:37:02] somebody say oh
[1:37:04] be taught of God
[1:37:06] every man therefore that hath heard and
[1:37:11] hath learned of the father cometh unto
[1:37:16] me
[1:37:19] okay now we're getting somewhere so it's
[1:37:22] no longer the Holy Spirit down here just
[1:37:24] trying to beg and plead and we've got
[1:37:26] preachers begging everyone to come to an
[1:37:27] altar please please please please accept
[1:37:28] Jesus please please accept Jesus Grandma
[1:37:30] want you there again no no no no no no
[1:37:32] no no no no no
[1:37:33] all of these the father has already
[1:37:37] taught each one of these individuals
[1:37:40] how did he teach him
[1:37:43] he placed the seed in his heart and
[1:37:47] those that have been taught they've got
[1:37:48] put it back up their sister Keys those
[1:37:50] that have been taught and there it is
[1:37:52] they shall all be taught of God every
[1:37:56] man therefore that hath heard and hath
[1:38:00] learned of the father cometh
[1:38:04] unto me
[1:38:09] well I just don't know I get out and
[1:38:11] witness and I witness and I witness it I
[1:38:13] witness if they've not been taught by
[1:38:15] God they're not coming here and ain't
[1:38:17] going to be there
[1:38:19] I don't care if they're famous singers I
[1:38:21] don't care if they're famous ah my movie
[1:38:24] stars if they've not been taught by God
[1:38:27] at the beginning
[1:38:30] they will not be with God at the ending
[1:38:36] you were in a fall is this okay you were
[1:38:40] in a fallen state
[1:38:45] but you were a son of God
[1:38:49] well that makes me want to shh
[1:38:55] amen amen now
[1:38:58] Now where's that scripture at I'm I I
[1:39:01] I'm so far off my notes here hallelujah
[1:39:03] where's that scripture at brother Merle
[1:39:05] you probably know what um
[1:39:07] amen Faith cometh by hearing
[1:39:11] uh
[1:39:12] um Faith cometh by hearing that's in
[1:39:14] Romans and I think it's Romans 10
[1:39:18] uh see Faith uh
[1:39:21] okay there we go okay let's go let's go
[1:39:24] whoopsies 17 16 15 14. let's let's go to
[1:39:28] 14.
[1:39:30] how then shall They Call On Him whom
[1:39:33] they have not believed how shall they
[1:39:36] believe in him who they have not heard
[1:39:39] how shall they hear without a preacher
[1:39:44] how shall they preach except they be
[1:39:46] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[1:39:48] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[1:39:49] of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good
[1:39:52] things
[1:39:53] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[1:39:57] for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed
[1:40:00] I report
[1:40:02] so then Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:40:06] hearing by the word of God
[1:40:08] next one
[1:40:10] but I say have they not
[1:40:15] heard
[1:40:16] yes verily their sound went into all the
[1:40:19] Earth and their words unto the end of
[1:40:22] the world
[1:40:24] okay so faith comes by hearing the word
[1:40:29] and yet not everyone believed and they
[1:40:32] heard it
[1:40:36] so let me just put it this way put it
[1:40:38] back up the 17th verse
[1:40:40] so Faith cometh by hearing and I'm going
[1:40:45] to put a little amen asterisk in there
[1:40:48] uh uh uh uh from the foundation of the
[1:40:52] world and hearing
[1:40:55] by the word
[1:40:58] Jesus says they that have heard and have
[1:41:01] been taught will come to me
[1:41:08] now wasn't that those Pharisees weren't
[1:41:11] there coming to them they were there in
[1:41:13] his church service
[1:41:15] so so it wasn't that he was saying was
[1:41:17] going to come and said instead no
[1:41:18] they're already here so that's not what
[1:41:19] he's talking about
[1:41:21] but those
[1:41:23] who God has put a predestinated seat on
[1:41:25] the end how can I be so sure that I'm
[1:41:29] going to make it brother Wendell because
[1:41:31] God seen me in this dark laodicea and
[1:41:33] God put his predestinated seed within my
[1:41:36] heart and said Satan you can't have him
[1:41:42] thank you
[1:41:45] there's going to be plenty of times I'm
[1:41:47] going to fall I'm going to fail I'm
[1:41:49] going to come up oh my I'm going to have
[1:41:51] but I'm here to tell you the blood was
[1:41:54] shed for me
[1:41:56] the blood of Jesus Christ is for me
[1:42:01] he came to redeem me there's nothing you
[1:42:05] can do
[1:42:07] you might fall today get back up you
[1:42:10] might fall tomorrow get back up you
[1:42:12] might fall next week get back up
[1:42:19] yeah
[1:42:21] there's gonna be plenty that's going to
[1:42:22] blaspheme God and not going to make a
[1:42:24] Rapture but not you you can't blaspheme
[1:42:25] God you came from God and the black
[1:42:29] shall never lose his power
[1:42:35] put that in your pipe and smoke it devil
[1:42:38] can you say Amen
[1:42:40] that'll sing how to say I guarantee you
[1:42:43] that sinjacy amen is that right
[1:42:47] now
[1:42:49] are you far are you catching me now God
[1:42:52] was from eternity to Eternity
[1:42:55] Hallelujah
[1:42:57] amen now there's none of us that do good
[1:43:01] there's none of us
[1:43:04] a Christian then says well no I'm the
[1:43:06] one that done it
[1:43:07] I accepted it
[1:43:09] I came and accepted Jesus
[1:43:13] bless your heart
[1:43:15] the Bible says they're in Romans 3 and
[1:43:17] 9. amen or three and ten
[1:43:20] as it is written there is none righteous
[1:43:22] no not one
[1:43:25] there is none that understand that there
[1:43:26] is none that even seeks after God
[1:43:33] they are all going astray they are all
[1:43:34] together become unprofit there is none
[1:43:36] that doeth good no not one
[1:43:41] if you come to this word and you are
[1:43:45] bowing at the feet of this Living Word
[1:43:50] it's because God
[1:43:57] it's because the golden scepter
[1:44:02] has been extended out to you
[1:44:05] it's because God loved you before
[1:44:09] [Laughter]
[1:44:11] oh glory be to God can you say man amen
[1:44:15] that's right so brother Branham says
[1:44:17] Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign One
[1:44:20] Sovereign Grace from a sovereign One
[1:44:22] Sovereign what can it do Sovereign can
[1:44:25] do whatever it wants to
[1:44:27] listen to it now Sovereign Grace can
[1:44:30] only be given by one that is sovereign
[1:44:33] God is Sovereign so he has given
[1:44:35] Sovereign Grace therefore being
[1:44:37] Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anyone
[1:44:41] someone shout hallelujah
[1:44:43] it does what it wants to isn't that

[1:44:59] vilest it can save the worst he can save
[1:45:02] the impurities he can save the
[1:45:04] immoralists he can heal the sickest
[1:45:06] Hallelujah God by Foreign knowledge knew
[1:45:10] that there had to be some preparation
[1:45:12] made to save man

[1:48:12] smoking and trying out the marijuana
[1:48:14] stuff and and trying a little bit of
[1:48:16] booze and because they're predestinated
[1:48:19] they're going to be there that's the
[1:48:21] sign that you might not even be
[1:48:22] predestinated
[1:48:26] if you're predestinated there is
[1:48:28] something in your heart that's longing
[1:48:30] for God but you couldn't get from here
[1:48:32] to here there was no way to get there
[1:48:36] but because you do have a predestinated
[1:48:39] seed that is Longing To please the Lord

[1:49:35] and when you find out who you are and
[1:49:38] that God's given you an atonement you're
[1:49:40] not going to want to sin you're not
[1:49:42] going to want to go out there in the
[1:49:44] world you are satisfied with what God
[1:49:47] created you to be
[1:49:54] if a preacher has to beat you up and if
[1:49:57] God has to beat you up
[1:50:00] and we've got problems
[1:50:02] God's created
[1:50:05] God's provided the remedy

[1:50:10] obstructed

[1:50:14] because Calvary
[1:50:16] was going
[1:50:17] amen
[1:50:19] to get all

[1:50:23] denominationalism

[1:50:29] seen by all the clouds of darkness and
[1:50:33] all the people's World down here in

[1:51:40] one by one we've already been taught by
[1:51:43] God before the foundation of the world
[1:51:44] and when the prophet comes down with the
[1:51:46] word of God saying hey what does it do
[1:51:47] it lifts us up to Calvary and back to a
[1:51:50] rapture

[1:59:52] no I don't want to read right no no no
[1:59:54] no no no no no no no no
[1:59:56] let's let's go on up here to um
[2:00:00] that's going up the seventh verse
[2:00:03] neither because they are the Seed of
[2:00:05] Abraham are they all children
[2:00:08] but in Isaac shall I seed be called
[2:00:11] that is they which are the children of
[2:00:14] the flesh these are not the children of
[2:00:15] God but the children of the promise are
[2:00:18] counted for seed
[2:00:20] for This Is The Word of Promise at this
[2:00:22] time I will come and Sarah shall have a
[2:00:25] son
[2:00:26] and not only this but when Rebecca also
[2:00:29] had conceived by one even by Our Father
[2:00:32] Isaac
[2:00:33] for the children being not yet born
[2:00:37] neither having done any good or evil
[2:00:41] that the purpose of God according to
[2:00:45] election might stand not of works but of
[2:00:49] him that calleth it was said unto her
[2:00:53] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[2:00:57] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[2:01:01] have I hated
[2:01:04] now
[2:01:07] God's not allowed that
[2:01:09] God we we are humans
[2:01:12] and humans have power in fact we have
[2:01:14] power over God
[2:01:16] and so we get to choose whether we're
[2:01:19] loved of God or whether we're hated of
[2:01:21] God no no
[2:01:23] Jacob have I
[2:01:28] oh have I
[2:01:35] now some of you just want to turn you oh
[2:01:37] all of those poor people why why look at
[2:01:40] all those poor people and start thinking
[2:01:41] of God for what God's done for you
[2:01:46] God seen down through laodicea and
[2:01:48] seeing that they're the whole the the
[2:01:50] whole kitten caboodle would be going to
[2:01:52] hell if he hadn't sent his son to redeem
[2:01:55] his own out of this mess
[2:02:01] can you say man
[2:02:02] now now let's keep going
[2:02:05] what shall we say then is there
[2:02:08] unrighteousness with God God forbid
[2:02:13] for he said to Moses I will have mercy
[2:02:15] on whom I'll have mercy
[2:02:17] I will have compassion on whom I'll have
[2:02:19] compassion
[2:02:20] so then it is not of him that willeth
[2:02:24] nor of him that runeth
[2:02:27] but of God someone shout hallelujah
[2:02:32] that shows Mercy
[2:02:35] for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh
[2:02:36] even for this same purpose have I raised
[2:02:38] thee up that I may show my power in thee
[2:02:43] that in that my name might be declared
[2:02:45] throughout all the earth now I want to
[2:02:47] stop just right here for a moment
[2:02:49] what
[2:02:54] for this purpose
[2:02:57] God raised that Wicked pharaoh who beat
[2:03:03] can kill and maimed
[2:03:07] you mean God raised Pharaoh up
[2:03:11] God raised Pharaoh up and then hardened
[2:03:15] his heart
[2:03:18] making Israel bleed even more
[2:03:22] make brick without straw
[2:03:26] you mean God raised him up
[2:03:33] yeah
[2:03:35] yeah
[2:03:37] you mean God created the devil yeah yeah
[2:03:41] yeah yeah
[2:03:49] God
[2:03:55] God who is on knowing knew it from the
[2:03:58] beginning
[2:04:00] he knew that the angel of Light would be
[2:04:02] what he'd done
[2:04:04] he didn't have a seat any
[2:04:07] but you're a son
[2:04:09] you're a son
[2:04:13] sometimes we're looking at the vile
[2:04:15] things in our lives and we're saying
[2:04:18] I don't understand
[2:04:20] I just want to tell you hang on
[2:04:22] hang on
[2:04:24] because God's writing a beautiful he's
[2:04:26] writing he's writing a story
[2:04:29] it's a beautiful picture
[2:04:31] God look what look what the scripture
[2:04:33] says
[2:04:34] amen for the scripture says unto Pharaoh
[2:04:36] even for this same purpose have I Elohim
[2:04:40] Jehovah raise thee up that I Elohim
[2:04:44] Jehovah Lord might show my power envy
[2:04:48] that my name shall be declared
[2:04:50] throughout all the Earth therefore he
[2:04:52] hath Mercy on whom he will have mercy
[2:04:55] and whom he will he hardness
[2:04:58] that will say then unto me why does he
[2:05:01] yet find fault for who has resisted his
[2:05:03] will but nay o man
[2:05:07] who art thou that replies against God
[2:05:09] shall have a thing form say to him that
[2:05:11] formed it why hast Thou made me thus
[2:05:13] hath not the Potter power over the clay
[2:05:16] of the same
[2:05:19] lump
[2:05:21] to make one vessel unto honor and
[2:05:23] another unto dishonor
[2:05:26] what if God willing to show his Wrath
[2:05:31] to make his power known endured with
[2:05:34] much long suffered suffering the vessels
[2:05:37] of Wrath fitted for Destruction
[2:05:39] that he might make known The Riches of
[2:05:44] his glory on the vessels of Mercy
[2:05:49] which he has before prepared
[2:05:54] under Glory
[2:05:57] well

[2:06:03] got you thinking that you're going down

[2:06:26] him back up because he's going to preach
[2:06:28] to Nineveh oh come on church and then

[2:06:42] backslidden prophet he says go back and

[2:06:46] there for three days so will the son of
[2:06:48] man be in

[2:12:52] your father
[2:12:54] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[2:12:57] is Our Father and Jesus said if you were
[2:13:00] Abraham's children you would do the
[2:13:02] works of Abraham
[2:13:04] but now you seek to kill me a man that
[2:13:07] hath told you the truth
[2:13:09] which I have heard of God
[2:13:11] this did not Abraham
[2:13:14] ye do all you you do the Deeds of your
[2:13:19] father
[2:13:20] and watch him watch him
[2:13:23] what'd they say they said unto him we be
[2:13:26] not born a fornication they knew the
[2:13:28] serpent seat even back then did you know
[2:13:30] that that the Jews teach the serpent
[2:13:32] seat
[2:13:32] we'll be not born of fornication
[2:13:36] we have one father
[2:13:38] and that is God
[2:13:39] and Jesus answered and said unto them if
[2:13:43] God were your father
[2:13:46] you would love me for I proceeded forth
[2:13:49] and came from God neither came I of
[2:13:51] myself but he sent me

[2:22:17] laodicea's interpretation of the Bible
[2:22:20] as a bunch of hogwash

[2:22:33] of the church like he wanted to in

[2:22:43] this laodicea church
[2:22:44] [Music]
[2:22:46] oh yeah they say they love him
[2:22:50] but they don't even know who Jesus is

[2:22:59] but I'm here to tell you there's a
[2:23:01] living Christ that's still walking among
[2:23:04] the candlesticks
[2:23:06] Satan's taking over he's taken over the
[2:23:09] church
[2:23:11] but there's an elect
[2:23:13] he says I'm going to pull you out of
[2:23:14] here
[2:23:15] I'm gonna take you to a New Kingdom
[2:23:19] and then I'm gonna burn the Antichrist
[2:23:21] I'm going to burn the
[2:23:26] [Music]
