necessity is laid upon me me yay Woe Is unto me if I preach not the gospel for if I do this willingly I have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the Gospel is committed unto me amen and now he is saying if I do it I will receive a reward if I do not do it willingly I will have to answer to God for the gospel that has been committed to me let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your your divine grace and your love this morning thankful for the anointing of your holy spirit that we feel Among Us thankful Lord for a wonderful week different ones with their families and we're so thankful Lord we're thankful for this church family that you have given us and we're so thankful Lord that this love here goes deeper than Lord the natural blood and it's it's the Eternal thoughts of God expressing themselves and loving one another we thank you for it Lord Lord we've been missing sister Angie and I I pray that she's Lord uh that you would be there with her and encourage her and Lord that she's recovering uh wonderfully here Lord and I just pray that you just continue to be with her father I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would just be with everyone that here or not here Lord whether they be sick and that you would heal them discourage encourage them Lord Lord we we ask that you would hear us here this morning and Lord that you would speak to us as we said it's your feet it's our honor to sit here this morning we're asking Lord that you would Minister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning amen praise the Lord I want to minister uh I've I've been doing this on Wednesday nights but I I thought that um I would go ahead and and Minister a little more on on ministry here uh this morning and um we've been talking about the preacher and then the last I had preached on the ministry of love and we are all ministers we are we are all here with this um with an incredible responsibility amen and the Apostle Paul says the necessity is laid upon me and woe is me if I fulfill not my purpose and I so I want to minister on the weight of ministry or the burden of ministry amen being burdened for Souls that you and I have been you and I have been committed unto uh we have been placed here on this Earth with a specific purpose a very specific purpose we everyone have come and we are here today with an incredible responsibility amen now the the ministry is not just a Pulpit ministry as we have mentioned from time to time amen yes there are ministers that stand behind the pulpit and we are thankful for everyone of those ministers we appreciate all of the preachers here but if you'll notice notice the preacher is one that expresses that Ministry outside of the pulpit he loves people amen his ministry is people and so he's not just suddenly anointed and happy when he's behind the pulpit but there is something on the inside within him that is driving him brother brandham would Express that it is it it it is just like that artisian well that is just bubling up he loves people so he's not just smiling and dancing and shouting behind the pull pit he is smiling and happy and loves people outside the pulpit that's that's that Ministry that is being expressed now amen but but the pulpit Ministry is not is not everything not all of us are called to be preachers not all are called to be prophets not all are called to be evang evangelist or or Apostles but we all are a part of the body of Christ and we are here under the authority and are taking Dominion together over devils and together as as a body of Jesus Christ we set the captives free we cast out Devils now brother Brenham was asked does that necessarily mean when it says these signs shall follow them that believe is everyone casting out Devils does everyone have the gift of healing brother bradam says no not everyone has the gift of healing not everyone has amen but together as the body of Christ we have one Ministry everyone say one Ministry you see I it's I'm just a small part part of that one Ministry amen I you you I have many amen parts of my body but I am one person amen I have one personality and that's that spirit that lives within me can you say Amen so every one of us carry amen a a weight of responsibility there is not one member that that is that is exempt from responsibility toward one another and toward amen uh the call that God has placed upon Our Lives amen so when we say that amen the weight of ministry or the burden of ministry amen it is saying that you are you feel the weight amen of responsibility you feel a burden for uh for your brother and your your sister no man lives to themselves no man dies to themselves I am responsible for you and you are responsible for me right praise the Lord amen and so when when we say burden for Souls we are carrying burdens for them amen and and when you're carrying a burden a burden is to give someone their problems or trouble or responsibility Amen to carry someone's weight it is to take away or carry off the weight uh uh someone else is experiencing amen so when God places a burden upon your heart it literally weighs upon your heart amen and the more fully that you can identify amen with the need of your brother or sister the more deeply you will feel the responsibility for them amen so you let let me let me just say it again the more fully the that you can identify with the situation or with the need of the body then the more deeply that you will feel the need for it amen so the we we don't separate ourselves because we don't live to ourselves but we are a unit in the spirit of the Lord amen then you can stand as as the Apostle Paul so totally in developed in the purpose of God that he said we pray you in Christ be ye reconciled unto God for God has given me the ministry of reconciliation he he placed himself he found himself in the position that God had placed for him this why brother brandham says amen all of the jumping and the shouting and the and and and the hollering and this speaking in tongues and this that and the other he says man you got a lot of power amen and it's going out the whistle but if you could ever find your purpose if you could ever understand that you are to be positionally placed then you can get the machine to go and down the road amen then you can get the machine to to operating the way God ordained it to operate well praise the Lord amen so that's what this message is all about it's the adoption message it is the placing of human beings on the earth fulfilling the purpose of God right one with deity where the power the presence the glory the shakina presence of God has came out of the heavens and is living bodily within human beings here on this Earth Oh Glory to God Amen you become the physical body of Jesus Christ so that his agape love is flowing in and out of you there in St John 17 and 18 it says as as as thou H has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they might be Sanctified through the truth can you say amen amen so you can understand now I've been called in position to to bring about a a a directive of God I've I've been I've been called to redeem them amen so that they in turn can fulfill the purpose for which they were called for you were called to minister before sin ever came you were called with a purpose before amen be before the fall ever got here Satan came in and and and and and and put a uh you know brought you out of that realm but Christ has come to restore you back to that place of authority with God Amen now amen here we are as Fallen humans but redeemed Fallen humans amen there in Galatians 6:1 now it says Brethren If any man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ the the law that Christ lived by is what we are now living by he picked those up when you couldn't carry your own burden and he carried it to the cross for you amen when you couldn't he did when you had the lack he came in and brought in and I say tonight here you stand this morning you said in this church amen Anointed with the very Spirit of of Christ fulfilling the law of God here on this Earth ah amen you yes you're moral human beings but within you is Supernatural gifts there are Supernatural gifts on the inside of you amen that was that you were born with that you would have fulfilled if there had not been no sin on the Earth but now Christ has come to remove Sin from you so that you can fulfill the purpose that God originally had for you amen amen amen the Apostle Paul as he's saying his good his final goodbyes is there in Acts 20 and 32 he says now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to uh give an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified I have covered no man silver or gold or apparel yeah ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessity talking about himself and to them that were with me I have showed you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive now he's he's he's talking to the he just he's just told the Elders of the church amen he's Le let them know I've not been disobedient to the vision I I I I have fulfilled everything that God has called me to do and I've shown you how to do this now I want you I'm leaving but I want you to continue the ministry that God has sent for you can you say amen amen folks love just cannot be displayed without having Eternal results love cannot be display I someone say it with me love cannot be displayed without Eternal results you are are God's ambassadors amen of redemption you are the extension of Jesus Christ when you receive the Holy Ghost Christ himself moved in you to live his life here on this Earth amen what was Jesus he was the perfect Lamb of God slain for an imperfect world Amen and we can only love God as he first loved us Romans 5 and six it says when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely a SC scarcely for a righteous man will one die per adventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commended his love toward us while we were yet sinners Christ died for us aren't you glad for this ministry of reconciliation that it's not if you do do I'll do you scratch my back I'll scratch your back no no no no no no Christ the very love of God is living within you to redeem the man that is not good to you that you can give when there's nothing in return coming back to you you can truly be a representative of the Eternal land that's the land we're going to brother that that's that's the civilization we're going to it ain't going going to be scratch mine and I scratch yours it ain't going to be do for me and I'll do for you no no no no we're going to a land of perfect love we're going to a Oh Glory to God there will be no hindrance to your faith there will be no hindrance to your love there'll be no hindrance to your worship there'll be no hindrance whatsoever and God's given you the opportunity right now to express that land right here in Le oia God's given you the privilege of loving your enemy God's given you the privilege of loving your brother and your sister and giving of yourself right here in Satan's Eden amen now brother Brennon would describe a burden as entering into the suffering of a person to have the feelings for someone to understand their pain he says but here's one thing I want to be honest I want to live in the condition just like the people that come to me so I can feel the suffering and fellowship with them and I'm right on the level with them that's the way I feel I don't say that just from a mouth I say that from a heart and God knows it to be the truth amen are are you understanding now brother Bram is expressing he's expressing how he's got his results we went through that amen the last Wednesday night we when I ministered on this amen it's he says if you want to know how my Ministry has been SU successful it's been because of love I genuinely love people amen now he would go on and he would say and you know you have to enter into the suffering of a person to have feelings for them amen I want you to really think you have to enter into the suffering of a person in order to have feelings for them if it ever gets to a place that I can't feel sorry for the sick then it's time for me to leave the platform praying for them when I get to the place that I can't feel the burden of sin on the people then it's time for me to get away from here because I can never do no good for God it's the feeling you have for the people oh burden feeling the weight the burden of ministry can you say Amen see Ministry is not Limelight Ministry oh yes people people want they think it's the Limelight but the but the burden of ministry is so incredibly great amen it it drives you to tears and Agony for people you pray with with with deep conviction the burden that comes with Ministry is is is not it's not glorious at all it is it is something that is that is heartwrenching for the teenager and you're and you're interceding before God with everything you've got it's a it's a cry for for for a brother or a sister or or someone that is sick and and you're entering in to the exact feelings there where they are and you're able to see things in a little bit different light than what a spectator would you were carrying the weight with them you're not saying be cloth be warm you've become naked with them your heart is now at one with him now there is it's a different story amen telling someone good old chap you're a wonderful fell and we'll be praying for you go in the door close the and go to bed amen leaving that no no no you are feeling the pain with them you are experiencing the load with them you are being amen used of God to express his love in human flesh he redeemed your soul so that your body and spirit can fulfill the purpose that he's ordained you to do praise the Lord can you say am man now he says now I believe the Christian is God's billboard I believe each one of us is God's billboard and if we don't and and we don't have to do much carrying on about it as we do just simply live such a life that'll make the people hungry to be like you can you say Amen so burden carrying a load feeling the responsibility for or the charge and man be you you you've been given the charge of or entrusted with a task as a Duty or a responsibility to be given the charge is to be assigned the duty you've been you've been assigned by God Amen the responsibility now I I think about that because amen the responsibility is incredible and and uh now now k is's falling asleep on me already here but amen someone else can tell him the story afterwards but amen they woke you up I'm talking about you amen and uh uh you know what watching him watching him as as as we were he was helping me out a little bit yesterday and he loved the responsibility that I was placing on him you know I I I need you to do this and he was just you see am man it wasn't I have to but he he he enjoyed that responsib ability and and and and that that respon and that is that why because he was created he was or he was created to to be a man he was created to do those things and so it's bringing the potential out of him and him showing that he can do it well praise the Lord amen and so when God places a burden or places you places you to a charge I don't care how many skill the task or how great the task amen the the responsibility is a privilege Amen brother bam says may the Lord Jesus bless you each one of you is my prayer and may you so live that you become so burdened may God put on you you people uh uh may God put on you people so burdened for lost souls till you can't sleep day or night may God grant the brandham Tabernacle that privilege of becoming so burdened I don't care if you shout if you do if you never do nothing else if you're just so burdened for lost souls till you can't sleep when you do that the world will be slipping in here to be prayed for that's right the world will come in to be prayed for you will be known everywhere God give us of his spirit and make us humble and break us down and make us so charged with the power of God to heal the the sick to cast out Devils to do great signs and wonders and when you lay your hands on the sick and ask that the blessings without one wave in your heart you believe that God's going to do it you watch that patient he'll begin to get better why the Evil's gone from it it's just like the tree that was standing and Jesus looked and there was no fruit on it and he said cursed be it 24 hours later they passed by and Peter said look the leaves are already welting something had taken place God's word was spoke and Jesus says have faith in God for if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it will obey you now he says it's the privilege of responsibility God's wanting to place his power on that body well praise the Lord he says now may God God grant the brandham Tabernacle the privilege of becoming so burdened that you can't sleep he said I don't care if you shout I don't care if you do any of these other outward manifestations he says but if it's here and it's really here then you'll become well known all over the place and healings and miracles and deliverances what can you say Amen now now we want to say the healing campaigns are over I agree 100% amen we want to say Amen Souls aren't being saved like they used to be saved and I say Amen they're not coming in the Groves like they used to come amen and and but I'm here to tell you as long as I'm here I've got a purpose and as long as I'm in his will I will expect the supernatural in me this is a body Ministry it's a body Ministry it's it's no more it's no more the great healing evangelist and all of us peons amen running all over the place trying to get someone to lay hands on us now we have come into maturity the bride is here Christ you are the bride coming of the Lord Jesus Christen now the desperation there's that desperate burden when you're burden in the heart amen even for lost souls you don't have to have a pull pit to preach amen they told Brother bradam that you remember that the the angel of the Lord amen he says I'll show you your Tabernacle now brother bradam was just amen just before he was he was dedicating the Bram Tabernacle he had went into a vision amen and he brought him out and he says the sky is your canvas the world the world is your Tabernacle amen you remember that then there was the two trees there was one tree that ran up and another tree tree that went up and he said that was that was the the the the Jesus only and then or Jesus only and the trinitarians and and he stood right in between them all and and the fruit was coming down and that he planted a tree and and and the tree went all the way up into the sky well you're the tree oh glory to God coming out of the denominational systems and the power of God living and reigning in this church what a powerful listen I I'm not saying this I'm not saying this just so that that you can feel good I I I you know I we we we ain't we ain't uh uh up here this morning amen uh ju just you know just giving you know a good pep talk I'm telling you the truth this is God's desire you are the design of God you are the very mouthpiece of God you are the very Oracles of God in human flesh amen now in the layot to seean church age brother Bram says no burden for SS but they got to see that all these other things are taken care of the L's Aid and these other things all has to be taken care of but no burden for low Souls oh man what this church has got into he says they they're not burdened for Souls but they're burdened with they're burdened with wealth that's right they had the wrong burden they had a burden for the wealth but not a burden for lost to then the scriptures say said that they didn't know that they were wretched miserable and blind they think they could take money and convert the world oh if we could just get a program on that we could get a lot of money uh here I believe it would convert the world if some of the rich people in our church brother brandham if we could just get them to dig out I believe we could start a society that will go around and convert the world we could take airplanes and drop liter literature over Africa and things like that if we just had some money brother the world won't be converted by money the world will be converted by the Holy Ghost the powerful preaching of the Holy Ghost and the cross will be the only thing that will convert the world the pro God's program is not money it's the Holy Ghost can you say Amen man he says now now if I'd say how many has the Holy Ghost all of you'd raise up your hand I'd say all right I'll see I'll see if you have it the Bible said that they that had the Holy Ghost sighed and cried day and night for the Abominations done in the city now how many hands would go up how many of you can't rest at night so full of joy the power of God and so sad for the people that's lost the power or that day and night You Weep and cry for the Abominations who who who would who would be in that City H how many's in in in the church amen that's what the Bible said the Holy Ghost evidence is can you say Amen so so brother brand I'm saying it is a Holy Ghost Church living under the living under the the the weight of ministry that is going to fulfill the Great Commission hallelujah amen it's just you living your everyday life you in love with God you calling out no it's not necessarily that you're out witnessing you can witness all the time without a burden for Souls but when God's holy spirit is within us that is crying out there's an anointing to go with that can you say amen amen yes sir now what did Brother Brandon or what did the scripture say would be one of the end time signs amen it would be a lack of love for your fellow man amen at the end time the la love of many shall wax cold but the prophet says hallelujah but the bride is will be will be under that anointing I want to say she's going to be dripping she's going to be dripping under that that Holy oil anointing of God Amen the bride will have that love can you say amen Amen brother Bram and or are you you there in in in uh God is talking to the tharan church age there in Revelations 2:19 it says I Know Thy works and love and service and faith and patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first and brother Bram would say huh he says you will note that their love is placed between works and service that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service see Paul speaking to the Corinthians said without love I am nothing whatever I do is without profit unless it is done in love now you can see right here that these Believers weren't in that Leo or that nickan class that did works as a mean of Salvation or to be admired by men they did their works out of love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost and that love in their heart was God's love for his own and Jesus said by this shall all men know that you're my disciples that you have loved uh one for the other now the the pagans who saw the lives of the early Christians said behold how they love each other John uh 1 John 4 and7 everyone that loveth God is born of God he says I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because the abounding of the love of many or or the abound the abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the lay out of sin uh the last age the self- love love for material things will take the place of the true love of God and we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effects of the last day spirit it's time to draw nigh to God let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of this last day church and reject the truth which is alone able to help us can you say mine now how many's how many's how many's with me here this morning oh the responsibility the weight there's nothing more precious now you can pray a you can pray a prayer half-heartedly as you're as you're giving thanks for the meal many times we give half-hearted prayers when we're going but how many's ever experienced experienced something really deep and tragic in your own life you're not just saying lay me down to sleep prayer you're not just when it's when it's your own when it's when it's your son or your daughter or your husband your wife or whatever it it brings about a greater sense of reality sometimes we pray and we say Lord amen bless this food thank you for this food and it should be done from the depths of our heart but many times it's repetitious but it's the it's when we can feel that need that puts us now I want to I want to say this as a minister as a pastor I hope this is okay here this morning as a pastor the weight of my responsibility causes me to study and pray because I know my responsibility is to is to feed the people so so the the weight or the burden of my Ministry causes me to take it seriously amen whereas you that don't have that weight on your shoulder you're not locking yourself up on Saturdays or Fridays you're not you're not you're not spending why because that weight is not on your shoulders it's on my shoulders there for amen well you you you you're enjoying your Saturdays and you're enjoying right but mine I know that I've got to preach this morning and I've got to take my responsibility seriously you know why sin has come into the church and crept in in such a way is because the weight of responsibility is no longer there therefore we allow anything to go in our Minds we allow anything we we hard we're not we're not entertaining the presence of the Lord Bea the weight now we've got a Ministry every one of us have got a Ministry but we're not feeling that weight seriousness of it the way that it should now I'm not you know you know it's easy again again now that I'm preached about you know I've done I've done talk to us all of us preachers amen and yes this does count for us preachers but I'm talking about every one of us there would not be sin in our lives many times if we were under the load if you had preach or if you had if if you had husbands amen out caring for their families and working every day and doing those kinds of things instead of being on the internet and making their wives do the work and all that kind of thing then we we'd have a little bit different americ today but the weight of their responsibility is not there therefore their family stagnant their family is going to hell in a hand basket their children are being lost it's because daddy is not feeling the weight of his responsibility amen now are are are y'all catching me so now as I as I as as I get into my thoughts here now the scripture says that we are priests unto our God now I want to speak for a few moments Amen on the intercessors I I think intercessor having the weight of intercessory having the weight of your brother might put a little bit more spark in our prayer right because you're not just there praying for for everyone on the earth and praying for Israel and the bride and praying for this one and praying for that one Hallelujah now let's go home no now as an intercessor you know that you're responsible and you're going in before the Lord with great responsibility are you hearing me now I and I as we as we look here brother brandham even talks he talks about going with a mortal and he and he's and he's talking about even if someone's done you wrong he says now if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this Brethren if you want to be a blessing and receive a blessing get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he has absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong you know that he's done you wrong he has done you evil he says don't mention that take him to prayer before God now don't take it in a way of a just a selfish way well I'm supposed to do this stand with stand with your shoulder to his shoulder stand in the presence of God our Father way of prayer should be made in the presence of God and say father here's my brother he deserves punishment because he has done me evil and I don't see why he done it then let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man is gone through the man has been twisted up somewhere caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong and before you leave the throne you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back down to Earth again you'll go over to that brother shake his hand cuz you know that he has what he has been through you can't not you cannot stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he is a ranked Sinner and what about a brother that has made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong and if we will take him to the throne of God and stand there shoulder-to-shoulder with our brother knowing he's Immortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him when we come back from the Throne of God we will realize that we're everyone guilty we all need help one from another and the best way to do is to pray oh wow that is talking this is totally this is totally contrary to me and you come on hey we ain't we ain't going to put up with too much too very long right but when the Holy spirit is flowing through us and working his life through us oh what a Ministry it is amen priest the prophecy was amen that God was going to bring Gentiles the Gentiles were going to rise up and they were going to be preached there in Malachi 1:11 and from the rising for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles and in every Place incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the Heathen saith the Lord of hosts can you say amen amen now now what what is he talking about on that incense now remember Amen in the Tabernacle there was the Brazen altar there's where the sacrifice was burnt slay and and burnt then going into the most or into the uh holy place is is is the Brazen uh labor that's sanctification that's where you you look in the mirror of God's word and then as you come on in fixing to go into the most holy place there was the golden Altar and this is where they offered the incense they would take the blood of the original lamb amen and they would bring it up and and and they would offer the flesh there upon it and it would be a sweet smell in Savor and this is where they would pray for amen uh H for their fellow man this was right before the veil this was there's the there there was nothing that separated uh uh uh uh uh the the golden altar from The Mercy Seat except for that Veil and that high priest would offer that he would offer it unto the Lord and walk into that Veil where the shika presence was at now so when he's talking about the Gentiles everywhere are going to be offering up incense it's talking about the veil being rent away it would no longer be an Earthly Tabernacle in Jerusalem but now there would be amen the veil removed and you and I could offer incense of prayer and praise you would offer it on the behalf of your fellow brother your fellow sister you the high priest was the only one that was able to do that but when Christ through his blood it was so powerful that it didn't just bring him in it brought you in Oh Glory to God Amen therefore there in 2 uh Corinthians 2:15 it says we are unto God a sweet smelling Savor of Christ and then that are saved and in them that perish you understand what I'm saying amen Sanctified now I I I I want us to think about that because what the blood of Jesus Christ has done it has taken away the middle wall of petition it has taken away the sin out of our Lives Hallelujah to where you and I can now stand in that Priestly realm amen stand before God and offer offer the blood for our brother offer prayer for our brother offer prayer for the sinner amen we can stand as an intercessor now we're not doing away with the with with with with the uh Brazen altar or the Brazen leather but we have been Sanctified and now we can come into the presence of God Amen we don't have to just pray uh uh uh uh just to lay me down to sleep prayer amen but now we've got the Priestly garments on that pre that that Priestly garment was one amen that had all of the of the 12 Stones for the tribe that the representing all of Israel the 12 tribes of Israel and they would take the blood he would take that lamb and they would come before God Amen representing all of those ones amen it was dear to his heart it was the weight that was upon his chest amen and he would be representing those that could not come into the presence of God Amen they weren't able to come maybe am mean they weren't allowed to come but you see you as a spiritual priest before God you can carry the weight of your brother and your sister the load of the world and you can come before father God and he will grant your request a privilege now no one else was going to that privilege of wearing that ought no one else was granted that privilege of the burden upon the shoulders like Aaron was but through the offering of Jesus Christ he has brought you and me into that privilege of where of of of of of carrying that burden oh bless the name of the Lord amen he goes oh he says there's he says my uh my aunt most um he's talking about Abraham he says now Abraham my son I'm going I'm going to show you that it's not going to be nothing that you have to do I'm going to do it anyhow I'm determined to save man regardless and God is going to do it by his grace he will do it and when I think of that it makes me just want to scream I think oh nothing I could do nothing but the blood of Jesus I haven't got nothing to offer nothing I My Utmost righteousness to to yours would be filthy uh filthy rags in his sight so I'm a sinner to begin with and there's nothing I can do about it but something he could do and he took his son's blood and covered it over me like that so that he sees me as a righteous man because his blood his son's blood has made me righteous now I can come in before the Throne of God and pray for my brother oh God amen Ephesians 5:2 and it says walk in love as Christ has also loved us and has given himself for an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling Savor now brother Brandon would talk about the perfume the incense and and how that God made that perfume and amen it's a great smelling Savor to make us well pleasing to God and he become crushed on Calvary and the sin of the world had to squeeze him squeeze out the life out of him and he died bearing the sins of the world that we might be Anointed with the rose of Sharon he died bearing the sins so that we might be Anointed with the rose of Sharon he was the lily of the valley he was went for our transgressions a sweet smelling saber by his stripes you were healed the lily of the valley that give us the Opium to ease our sickness and pain what a marvelous picture can you say man he says now the high priest before you can go into the holiest the first thing he had to have a certain made garment it couldn't be by anyone it had to be made by holy hands amen just showed that our garments just happen to come to me then brother if you're only wearing a church garment you You' better get rid of the thing you can't go behind the holiest of holies the Garment of the high priest wore in there was made out by holy hands selected Goods ordained of God there it is so if you join the church you might think you're all right but you're wrong it has to be God selected robe oh are yall understanding me here this morning that that not not we're not just coming into the presence of God just to come in and say hello hello hello hello no we're coming with a weight we're coming before God with a respon responsibility we're coming before God because there's something about we've been given the privilege we've been given the privilege of walking in before God our morning time prayers is a privilege not a duty our evening prayer should be a privilege and not a duty Ministry should be a privilege and not a duty can you say man now am man that altar of incense was was an incredible thing now there in 1 Peter 2 and 5 it says ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ now I I I I I I love that there in psms 141 David says Lord I cry unto thee make haste unto me give give ear unto my voice when I cry unto thee let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting of my hands as the evening sacrifice can you say Amen now this priest was to it was to be a Perpetual offering of incense and other words all time it would be endless never ending without ceasing that's what prep Perpetual means and that's the reason why first Thessalonians uh uh 5:1 17 says pray without ceasing pray without ceasing amen this is this is this is something that is what God has has ordained for us to do is to come in to his presence not without blood but we had to come into His presence with blood for our fellow man Jesus had to become a man to feel the pain of humanity Jesus could not be a minister until he become human only then could he feel our pain experience the headaches experience what teenagers go through what M and daddies go through he experienced this and then and then only could he become a faithful priest unto God that's right are y'all catching my drift here this morning when the Holy Spirit is is living in us now I'm not going to hold you too much longer amen when the Holy Spirit is living in us it is the spirit of redemption Oh Glory to God Abraham offering in the stead of Christ and I I think I've got scripture here man when he was pleading for for Sodom and I don't guess I have it here but when he come face to face with God and now God had just came become a human to talk with a human so God had just came and revealed himself to Abraham and Abraham fed God in a body and then when God is sitting there God says listen sodom's fixing to burn and then Abraham looked to God in flesh and says listen if if there's 50 and he begin to intercede for for lot amen begin to intercede if there's 40 if there's if there on and on he went and and and and and now lot was never given the Revelation but because of the intercession of Abraham lot was spared when the city was overthrown can you say man some people say whether or not bride who who who is that for me they're humans right do I want any of my fellow men to go to hell come on oh but they're not bride it's just what no that is not the attitude Christ died for us all God so loved the world that he gave God is not willing that any should perish now will they all accept it no but I've got a responsibility and I can keep them they might not have their lamp their names written WR on that Lamb's Book of Life and they might even have to go through the tribulation but brother I don't want them going to hell I'll do everything and and who am I to put any mortal man in in the Rapture or out of the Rapture who are you our job is to intercede for the lost our heart is redemption we're ooing with love people we don't want to see anyone lost sir we don't want to see anyone go through the tribulation we don't want to see anyone hurt amen the Holy Spirit within us living himself through us interceding through us the scripture says amen that we know not how to pray but the Spirit intercedes through US uttering groanings that cannot be uttered when we don't know how to do it God through us oh I want a feeling I want a feeling for people I want a feeling now I preached the other day about loving people and people is our ministry but now I'm want I'm I'm wanting to get you the place on the inner inner Veil you can't help those people in the outer courts you can't help those people Amen in in the in the Holy place the only place you can help those people is for those that have got the blood of Jesus and inside that most holy place the Bride of the Lord Jesus others are trying to get him to their denomination others are trying to get him to this and trying to get him that but the bride has a love for them and they're trying to get them to Christ and you are that bride if you don't care for the sick who can help them if you don't care for the sinner you say ah well we got plenty of other churches we're dis interested in the bride what other CH the other church is just going to get them to the Royal Rangers or going to get them to you know this program or that program you're the only one that can finish the Great Commission you're the only one that can stand as an intercessor you know this us far and no more mentality is not of God I promise you that there's going to be a lot more in heaven when you get there than what you think was going to be there sir oh come on brother brandom talked about Moses and Aaron and when God came to Moses he's upset Moses or God's upset there numbers 16 and 44 and the Lord said unto Moses get you up from among this congregation that I may consume them in a moment and they fell upon their faces and Moses said unto Aaron take a censor put fire therein from off the altar put on incense go quickly into the congregation make an atonement for them for there is wrath going out from the Lord and the plague has begun and Aaron took as Moses commanded and ran into the to the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put the incense and made an atonement for the people and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed now they that died in the plague were 14,700 besides them that died about the matter of Kora return unto Moses under the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and the plag was stayed are you hearing me now God himself Moses was pleading for the people when they made the golden calf and he threw himself before the the wrath of God and acted as a intercessor for the people and he says God you're going to have to take me right along with the people Moses could have said that's a good I'm so happy this congregation has has been a boil they have chapped m hi I will gladly step out and you just do what you've got to do Moses stood right there and says God I'm not moving if you kill them you have to kill me too let's just look at it Exodus 32 and9 and the Lord said unto Moses I have seen this people and behold it's a stiff neck people now therefore let me alone let my wrath W that my wrath May Wax Hot against them that I may consume them and I will make thee a great nation and Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why do thy wrath Wax Hot against thy people which thou Hast brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say for Mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and consume them from the face of the Earth turn from thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people remember and Moos this is Moses talking to God this is Moses interceding this is IM mortal man standing before the Eternal God he says remember Abraham Isaac and Israel thy servants to whom thou swearest by thine own self and said us unto them I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and all this land that I have spoken I will give unto your seed and they shall inherit forever and the 14th verse let's all read it together and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people the power of an intercessor the power of that load that is Upon Our shoulders don't cherk the load for wealth don't cherk that burden for anything else you're going to be burdened with something you're going to be burdened you're you're you're going to be burdened you're going to make your bill so much until you just can't breathe hardly you're burdened you're going to be burdened with things until you've got so many things you don't you can't care for your things you're going to be so burdened with something why not carry the burden of ministry here on this Earth why not carry the load that God ordained for you to carry selfishness will get you no reward selfishness will not gar Souls selfishness will never do it God's called you to stand in the gap for your fellow man who cares if they say it the way I see it the heartbeat of God reflected through you it's a privilege of being burdened it's a privilege to lay down my life for the cause of Jesus Christ some of us can't even lay down our selfish burden to go help another brother some of us can't even come and help molon at the church some of us can't even help we some of us have we're burdened but it ain't sure it ain't the work of God you see what's the lawn to the church what's what what is the lawn what what what is helping I mean come on this is all natural what would this church be if everyone served God like you or I'll do it on my own terms what happened to Brotherhood and Ministry I've Got a Feeling when you've got a feeling it ain't a title you know Pastor so Pastor is only going to do Pastor work sitting behind the desk and coming up and delivering flowery messages no Pastor is first of all a mer a a a a servant fulfilling a Ministry deacons and trustees and pastors and five-fold Ministry these are all wonderful titles but they're nothing unless first of all it beats here amen got the heart in the wrong place it's got to beat here but I say take away all the titles push the titles aside you know what makes a church a church not the pastor you know what makes the church a church not the five-fold ministry we're just here for for the growth and the maturity in the word and God gives us gifts to guide but the church is you the church is me without all the titles we are the body of Jesus Christ skip the titles I don't want a title I want to be a Christian I want the love of God to flow through me am I beating a dead horse I'm not saying we don't have Ministry I'm saying that weight that you've got it's a privilege brother Brandon would say now look at Moses when he come to a time that he displayed all his life was the displayed all of his life was the spirit of Christ for Christ was in him Christ was in Moses by measure now we notice that he was born in the time of persecution children was killed to try to get into him try to get him just exactly like they did Jesus and we find out that when he come to a place that the children of Israel had disobeyed in such a way until God was angry with them and he said to Moses step aside and I'll destroy the whole group of them and I'll take you and raise up another generation Moses threw himself in the path of God's judgment and said take me before you take them in other words before you can get to them you'll have to come over me that's just exactly what Jesus Christ did when God would have wiped the whole face of the Earth off with these Sinners you and I Christ threw himself in the path and God could not do it he couldn't come over his own son when God seen that spirit in Moses hanging in the Judgment like a cross he says you can't come to them you'll have to take me first' and then the spirit of God and Moses when when he could have been the king of Egypt when he could have had the luxury every luxury in the world to be popular when he could have been the great king of the world at the time and he chose to suffer the persecution and the Affliction for he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than that of Egypt so he threw himself in the way why it was God in Moses did that normal thinking intellectual men would never do that he would take the easy Road no matter how much of a fanatic Moses seemed to be he was trying you see he had a he had a true he was a true prophet of God because he was trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God on down he says now he says I want to show you what a man is before God how core and all these notice when God told Moses step aside I'm going to destroy the whole bunch of them and make you a nation Moses threw himself in front of God he bridged his way and he said God take me God cannot cross that man a power of a saint before God the power of a saint it's the more powerful than Angels Angels can't intercede the seraphim couldn't intercede they were the throne guards but they couldn't intercede they were shouting holy holy holy holy Lord God Almighty but that song becomes secondary the Bible says when the seven seal was opened up there was silence in heaven there was something that was beginning to take place because underneath that was the redeemed of God underneath that there was something brother bam says everyone stopped now everyone's attention is looking on the earth because there is a bride in full maturity the mystery of God is living in human beings the power of God is living in you can you say Amen now he say I believe the reason we don't have desperation is because of the lack of love God the love of God I think that the love of God causes desperation if God is in you the token inside of you and you see the conditions of the times and the people waiting in the Sin the way they the way they are it'll throw you in desperation I just believe it will he says you can you can't be desperate till God speaks to you oh Church rise Shake Yourself pink your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish there is coming forth something from the Lord I know it says thus saith the Lord there is coming forth something and we better be desperate it's between life and death it'll pass through us and we won't see it can you say Amen now this is after the seals had taken place the Satan wanting what is Satan going to do is Satan going to let you come and intercede easily and the musicians can come is he going to let you before the throne easily I think we've got plenty of scripture to say that it doesn't come easily we look at Zechariah the third chapter and the first verse and and it says and he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing on his right hand to resist oppose him now he was a wonderful priest Joshua was a wonderful priest the Bible says that he would there as he stood before the Lord his clothes were tattered and torn and filthy and he had been standing there for the people and he was weary he was tired he was a wonderful priest and he needed a priest and God stood for him when he was tired and weary the next verse second verse and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuke thee Oh Satan even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a brand plucked out of the fire go to the next and Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him and said take away the filthy garments from him he's been an interceder he has stood for intercession now I'm going to intercede for him take away the filthy garments and unto him he said behold I have watched thine iniquity pass from thee and I will clothe thee with a change of reignment and I said let them set a fair miter up on his head and so they set a fair miter up on his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of the Lord stood by you remember the S saraph phenician woman she was a gentile Jesus said been as brother Brandon would give the drama Jesus was wore out he was trying to rest he was so tired the disciples were standing guard Peter was standing there and saying you can't see the master she says I've got to my daughter's dying the only one I can get to he's the only one that can do it he said no but she finally somehow got by him and then there was there was Andrew standing there said we told you no she said I got to get I got to get to him she's my only daughter I got to get help she pushed past all those obstacles and then when she gets to Jesus Jesus just being cranky supposedly said I've not come for you dogs I've come for Israel just just go on I I my Ministry is not for you Gentiles that'll come but not today she dropped to her knees she said it is true I'm a dog I'll Grant it but even the dogs get the crumbs from the master's table it was the heart reaching out for somebody else Jesus stopped turning around and said oh I've not seen so great a faith in all Israel he said go go your way and you'll find it as you have believed and her daughter was whole it's not easy the life of a servant is not sitting in the high places and receiving honor the life of a servant is caring and loving and giving giving and giving and giving for the sake of somebody else that's their whole purpose is to give for somebody else other things are just titles they're servants at heart and God hears the request he'll hear the request to you youngans something about a burd in heart caring for somebody you'll remember you'll remember when brother Bram Angel of the Lord told the woman says you're healed someone else's you were healed while ago or something of that nature he says get up off the bed and when she got up it was brother bram's own daughter his little girl that had been kneeling beside the woman that was dying she was a long ways away from brother brandham he couldn't see but she was praying and the spirit of the Lord came upon the prophet and told him said you're healed he said it was her God heard her prayer oh don't let no other burden be on your shoulders than the burden of Ministry for this purpose have I come into the world for this purpose to seek and to save that which is lost and at this mind of Christ being in you who thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation be he he become obedient unto death he gave of himself so that he could win a world just remember when you've got your burden there's a lot of Natural Things That Go involved with it don't get so caught up that you're doing it all in the natural now that
